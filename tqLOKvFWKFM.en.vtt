00:00:59.601 --> 00:01:03.112
So, this is how Mahamaya plays.

00:01:03.827 --> 00:01:05.919
They had planned everything.

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:10.399
They had all the arrangements made

00:01:10.519 --> 00:01:13.070
and the sari was missing.

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:18.910
All right. So they came and told Me that the sari’s missing,

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:20.664
so now what to do?

00:01:20.784 --> 00:01:25.046
You can’t have puja without the sari, according to them.

00:01:25.166 --> 00:01:28.257
So I said, “All right, let’s wait.

00:01:28.377 --> 00:01:30.591
If it arrives in time we’ll have it;

00:01:30.711 --> 00:01:33.569
otherwise we can have it later.

00:01:33.734 --> 00:01:37.632
But I was least disturbed,

00:01:38.188 --> 00:01:40.777
least upset.

00:01:40.897 --> 00:01:45.229
Because I do not have a mental conception of it.

00:01:47.306 --> 00:01:48.855
But if you have a mental conception,

00:01:48.975 --> 00:01:52.020
“Oh, we have programmed everything, arranged everything.

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.233
We have done this and now it’s fizzling out.”

00:01:55.353 --> 00:02:01.155
Doesn’t matter. Nothing is fizzling out.

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:06.568
But that is what we cannot do.

00:02:06.688 --> 00:02:08.823
Because you asked Me today, “What is Mahamaya?”

00:02:08.943 --> 00:02:12.121
This is what it is.

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:18.861
You must learn to accept whatever comes your way.

00:02:18.981 --> 00:02:21.304
That’s one of the things.

00:02:21.546 --> 00:02:25.141
And here where we feel frustrated, angry,

00:02:25.261 --> 00:02:30.798
upset and spoil our joy, one of the things,

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.394
because we make a mental projection.

00:02:34.514 --> 00:02:36.794
Mentally we calculate something.

00:02:36.914 --> 00:02:38.134
This has to be.

00:02:38.254 --> 00:02:43.626
And it’s really in a way a subtle ego feeling.

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:50.278
Because I thought, “That’s what is destined. All right.

00:02:50.398 --> 00:02:53.018
We’ll have it tomorrow. What does it matter?”

00:02:53.138 --> 00:02:57.859
In any case I told Mr. Srivastava that I’ll be back

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:59.957
only about two o’clock.

00:03:00.077 --> 00:03:01.317
He said, “Why not in the morning?”

00:03:01.437 --> 00:03:05.141
“I don’t think it will be feasible.”

00:03:07.388 --> 00:03:11.567
So this is how you become avyagra.

00:03:11.694 --> 00:03:16.120
Vyagra means person who is worried.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.510
The one who is not worried.

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.096
So we worry because of two things.

00:03:22.216 --> 00:03:30.202
Firstly, we worry that what will happen in the future?

00:03:32.885 --> 00:03:35.122
Future doesn’t exist.

00:03:35.242 --> 00:03:36.748
If you have made up your mind

00:03:36.868 --> 00:03:38.513
that this should happen in the future,

00:03:38.633 --> 00:03:42.282
then you get upset. That’s one thing.

00:03:43.303 --> 00:03:45.885
But you have not made any mental picture,

00:03:46.005 --> 00:03:48.203
you will see what comes on the scene.

00:03:48.323 --> 00:03:52.936
You’ll watch whatever appears.

00:03:53.056 --> 00:03:55.700
Then you’re not worried, because you’re anxious to see

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:58.345
what’s going to happen.

00:03:58.465 --> 00:04:03.961
That’s one way, that you feel hurt, that you’re worried.

00:04:04.081 --> 00:04:07.692
Secondly you worry when you have built up a myth,

00:04:07.812 --> 00:04:14.774
picture of that “Oh, we’re going to have a puja now,

00:04:14.934 --> 00:04:16.993
and we are not having it.”

00:04:17.113 --> 00:04:18.819
So you are upset.

00:04:18.939 --> 00:04:22.695
What difference does it make?

00:04:22.815 --> 00:04:28.034
And then you cannot enjoy My talk today and the puja tomorrow.

00:04:28.154 --> 00:04:30.330
Because today you think it was going to be puja.

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:34.987
We are all dressed up well. Very nice

00:04:35.163 --> 00:04:37.323
We spend so much time to get ready for the puja.

00:04:37.443 --> 00:04:41.622
All right, we’ll have it tomorrow. What does it matter?

00:04:43.254 --> 00:04:46.279
We really decorated ourselves well.

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.077
We were all ready for the puja,

00:04:48.197 --> 00:04:49.850
we were sitting here for the puja,

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:53.360
and now what has happened!

00:04:55.483 --> 00:04:59.954
I didn’t wear My sari for puja at all.

00:05:00.562 --> 00:05:03.777
I knew what was coming.

00:05:12.035 --> 00:05:14.673
So, it’s all right to see you like this.

00:05:14.793 --> 00:05:17.096
Because normally in the puja, I never see you dressed like this,

00:05:17.216 --> 00:05:19.189
I’m busy with Myself.

00:05:19.309 --> 00:05:24.644
Now I can see you nicely dressed. I feel very happy about it.

00:05:27.549 --> 00:05:33.379
And these mental things are responsible for frustrating us.

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:37.344
Like as I was telling you about money. Same thing happens.

00:05:37.464 --> 00:05:39.651
In India people come.

00:05:39.771 --> 00:05:42.804
They keep so much money for buying things.

00:05:42.924 --> 00:05:46.623
You see, sometimes they come loaded just like

00:05:46.836 --> 00:05:48.685
what you call traders.

00:05:48.805 --> 00:05:50.711
The customs are so kind, I mean

00:05:50.831 --> 00:05:52.910
Sahaj Yogis have a free pass,

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:55.341
whether in India, or in England or anywhere.

00:05:55.461 --> 00:05:57.369
And then they have a mental picture,

00:05:57.489 --> 00:06:02.091
“We’ll buy this.” All right? “And see so much we’ll spend.”

00:06:02.722 --> 00:06:04.922
And if they have to spend some money for something else,

00:06:05.042 --> 00:06:09.219
they get upset because they have decided to spend so much.

00:06:09.381 --> 00:06:12.024
So then they might go to spend some money.

00:06:12.144 --> 00:06:15.883
That’s also, you see how Mahamaya works, you see?

00:06:16.445 --> 00:06:20.571
It has happened with all of you.

00:06:20.691 --> 00:06:22.396
So they go and buy something.

00:06:22.516 --> 00:06:26.419
I’ll tell you Gavin bought once a image.

00:06:26.539 --> 00:06:29.932
I don’t know he paid about, I think 500 rupees

00:06:30.052 --> 00:06:33.129
no how much have you paid about 4,000 or I don’t know.

00:06:33.249 --> 00:06:35.050
How many pounds you paid for that?

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:38.916
Gavin: Forty pounds.

00:06:39.036 --> 00:06:41.071
Forty pounds. He paid forty pounds for that thing.

00:06:41.191 --> 00:06:44.721
I would not even pay five pounds for that.

00:06:44.841 --> 00:06:46.696
And I said, “What’s this? How did you buy?”

00:06:46.696 --> 00:06:51.490
“Oh, it’s a very nice thing, Mother. We got it in Agra.”

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:53.961
I said, “It is from Nepal. If you buy it in Agra,

00:06:54.081 --> 00:06:59.136
I think it is very expensive and it’s such a waste.”

00:06:59.256 --> 00:07:01.823
But the worst was the vibrations were very bad.

00:07:01.943 --> 00:07:04.284
They thought they’ve bought something great.

00:07:04.404 --> 00:07:07.716
And the vibrations were very bad and I noticed it.

00:07:07.836 --> 00:07:09.498
So he said, “All right, Mother. I’ll keep it in Your house

00:07:09.618 --> 00:07:11.395
and You improve the vibrations.” I tried.

00:07:11.515 --> 00:07:14.382
It would not work out. I said, “Gavin, what to do now?

00:07:14.502 --> 00:07:19.354
You sink it in the Thames. I don’t know what.”

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:24.878
And then luckily it happened C.P. said that,

00:07:24.998 --> 00:07:28.231
“I have to take some present of Buddha to Japan.”

00:07:28.351 --> 00:07:31.632
I said, “These Japanese exhibitors are good for nothing.

00:07:31.752 --> 00:07:34.176
No bhoot is going to trouble them.”

00:07:34.296 --> 00:07:36.297
So he said, “Can I buy something?”

00:07:36.417 --> 00:07:39.188
I said, “Buddha’s things means it’s not easy to get here.”

00:07:39.308 --> 00:07:41.964
“But I have avlokhiteshwara. Would you like to take that?”

00:07:42.084 --> 00:07:43.056
He said, “What is the price?”

00:07:43.176 --> 00:07:46.699
I said, “Forty pounds.”

00:07:47.572 --> 00:07:50.774
He said, “All right. All right. I’ll take it.

00:07:50.894 --> 00:07:53.400
And he bought it for forty pounds.

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:55.926
I said, “All right. Give it to the Japanese fellow.”

00:07:56.046 --> 00:07:59.696
He was a very nasty person. I said, “Good for him.”

00:08:01.647 --> 00:08:05.365
And I found it out that,

00:08:05.485 --> 00:08:10.307
you see because I knew that it will have some purpose somewhere.

00:08:10.682 --> 00:08:15.050
So this is how our mental images are so rigid

00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:20.262
that there’s no flexibility in our understanding.

00:08:20.382 --> 00:08:22.990
And if you start making it flexible then

00:08:23.132 --> 00:08:26.595
and this is very early stages when Gavin had gone to India,

00:08:26.715 --> 00:08:29.199
very early. Now he’s different.

00:08:29.319 --> 00:08:32.266
So if you become flexible,

00:08:32.386 --> 00:08:36.162
then what happens you see the joy of it.

00:08:36.282 --> 00:08:39.857
You see how things get adjusted. But if it is rigid,

00:08:39.977 --> 00:08:43.160
then you get caught up into your own rigidity.

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:46.008
And you can never enjoy it,

00:08:46.128 --> 00:08:51.054
because there’s no movement for the Mahamaya power.

00:08:51.209 --> 00:08:53.450
And that’s how then you feel frustrated.

00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:56.292
You see it is all your own creation.

00:08:56.412 --> 00:09:00.325
The mental projection is your creation,

00:09:00.445 --> 00:09:06.268
and also the destruction is your creation.

00:09:06.843 --> 00:09:10.937
Nobody is responsible for that. You are responsible.

00:09:12.467 --> 00:09:15.372
But who does that is Mahamaya,

00:09:15.492 --> 00:09:19.277
“Sankalpa vikalpa karo”, you do decide something.

00:09:19.397 --> 00:09:23.522
You say, “Now today I will go to Birmingham.

00:09:23.642 --> 00:09:25.504
I have to go to Birmingham.

00:09:25.624 --> 00:09:30.949
I can’t come for a meditation. I have to.”

00:09:31.069 --> 00:09:32.446
After some time you will find

00:09:32.566 --> 00:09:35.744
that it’s impossible to do something,

00:09:35.864 --> 00:09:39.295
but to do what is needed for Sahaj Yoga.

00:09:39.415 --> 00:09:41.172
Because whenever you will try to do something,

00:09:41.292 --> 00:09:45.974
you will find it will frustrate you, it will upset you.

00:09:46.094 --> 00:09:49.830
If not, then it will make you realize

00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:53.077
what is important, what you’ve missed.

00:09:54.291 --> 00:09:58.551
Sometimes you get lost on the way.

00:09:58.671 --> 00:10:01.832
You think that, “Oh God. We have lost the way.

00:10:01.952 --> 00:10:05.063
What to do? Now where to go?”

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:10.779
If I was you, I would say, “All right.

00:10:10.899 --> 00:10:13.431
We’ve lost the way. Must be to find something else.”

00:10:13.551 --> 00:10:17.248
And there I find something else which I’ve been looking for,

00:10:17.368 --> 00:10:23.328
for days together. I just see that there.

00:10:26.374 --> 00:10:34.783
So if you trust your joy giving quality of your Spirit,

00:10:36.358 --> 00:10:39.545
that you’re not going to lose that quality of the Spirit,

00:10:39.665 --> 00:10:42.117
at any cost.

00:10:42.833 --> 00:10:47.987
Then that acts as a guide

00:10:48.528 --> 00:10:54.579
and you understand the flexibility

00:10:54.699 --> 00:10:58.568
of all these worldly, transitory things.

00:10:59.609 --> 00:11:01.561
They are all changeable,

00:11:01.681 --> 00:11:06.301
only you cannot change because you are the Spirit.

00:11:09.697 --> 00:11:12.643
Today I wanted to talk about Mooladhara,

00:11:12.763 --> 00:11:16.943
which is very important subject.

00:11:18.998 --> 00:11:23.297
I think I have talked about it many a times.

00:11:23.417 --> 00:11:27.590
But in the West I must say,

00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:35.277
because of our wrong attitudes

00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:45.264
and the acceptance of wrong mental projections

00:11:45.384 --> 00:11:49.211
of other people who are very dominating,

00:11:50.147 --> 00:11:56.451
we have very much ruined our Mooladhara.

00:11:58.607 --> 00:12:02.470
Despite the fact that Kundalini has risen

00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:07.509
with whatever weaker power that Mooladhara had,

00:12:07.641 --> 00:12:11.043
and has sustained itself,

00:12:11.655 --> 00:12:17.025
we must know that we can always fall a trap

00:12:17.145 --> 00:12:26.441
to our different bifurcations which we had created before.

00:12:28.896 --> 00:12:32.673
It's a very serious matter

00:12:32.793 --> 00:12:39.187
that the Mooladhara chakra has been really shattered,

00:12:39.349 --> 00:12:43.753
and we have created pathways

00:12:43.873 --> 00:12:47.202
into which our attention can go

00:12:47.322 --> 00:12:50.929
if we are not very careful.

00:12:52.477 --> 00:12:56.250
Now supposing if somebody is a dishonest person,

00:12:56.370 --> 00:12:59.843
or a miserly person, or money oriented,

00:12:59.963 --> 00:13:05.968
it is very gross and you can see it so clearly.

00:13:06.795 --> 00:13:09.380
You see yourself and you get shocked how,

00:13:09.507 --> 00:13:13.625
“Why did I say such a thing? Why did I do such a thing?”

00:13:17.258 --> 00:13:24.694
But when it comes to the left side nonsense,

00:13:24.814 --> 00:13:27.566
sin against the Mother,

00:13:29.989 --> 00:13:35.845
it's a secretive action

00:13:35.965 --> 00:13:39.892
that's only between you and yourself.

00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:45.874
Nobody knows what goes on in your mind, except for you.

00:13:46.492 --> 00:13:50.684
Nobody knows what you are going to do

00:13:51.692 --> 00:13:58.309
next moment in your privacy when you are alone.

00:13:59.392 --> 00:14:03.587
Nobody can look into you except for your Mother.

00:14:03.707 --> 00:14:07.012
I also only feel your Mooladharas.

00:14:07.132 --> 00:14:10.337
To be very frank with you,

00:14:10.457 --> 00:14:15.647
that's one center I find it difficult to feel Myself.

00:14:15.767 --> 00:14:23.534
The reason is, I have a very, very strong Mooladhara,

00:14:26.115 --> 00:14:31.213
which is not so sensitive, I would say.

00:14:32.018 --> 00:14:33.611
It is not bothered.

00:14:33.737 --> 00:14:38.059
The attention of My Mooladhara doesn't go

00:14:38.179 --> 00:14:41.764
near any other Mooladhara. It just recedes back,

00:14:41.884 --> 00:14:43.988
that's the action it plays all the time.

00:14:44.108 --> 00:14:48.071
So I also, unless and until it is very badly off,

00:14:48.191 --> 00:14:50.638
I mean the person is very close to Me,

00:14:50.758 --> 00:14:52.858
then I feel the Mooladhara very strongly.

00:14:52.978 --> 00:14:55.767
But still I can?

00:14:55.887 --> 00:15:00.441
Supposing you give Me something, that thing is used by you,

00:15:00.561 --> 00:15:03.914
immediately I can feel it.

00:15:04.546 --> 00:15:10.196
So the correction of Mooladhara entirely depends on you.

00:15:10.316 --> 00:15:13.997
And without a strong Mooladhara you cannot rise high,

00:15:14.117 --> 00:15:16.454
do what you like.

00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:23.538
Now for people who are Indian,

00:15:23.658 --> 00:15:27.323
who have respected their Mooladharas,

00:15:27.443 --> 00:15:30.264
there are so many methods and ways given

00:15:30.384 --> 00:15:37.447
how to raise the power of Mooladhara.

00:15:37.567 --> 00:15:41.314
But that won't work out with the Western people,

00:15:41.434 --> 00:15:45.054
because it's a damaged one.

00:15:45.174 --> 00:15:48.921
It's one which is a shattered one,

00:15:49.041 --> 00:15:52.597
and which does not work on the physical side of the Mooladhara,

00:15:52.717 --> 00:15:56.794
but on the emotional side as we call the “Mana”,

00:15:56.914 --> 00:16:00.568
the left side.

00:16:02.482 --> 00:16:07.976
So, even you may not talk in that way,

00:16:08.096 --> 00:16:13.210
but your mind is still in that realm.

00:16:13.770 --> 00:16:17.796
And you still think on that realm.

00:16:17.916 --> 00:16:22.880
Even mentally, you are in it.

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:27.971
Or you are seeing things,

00:16:28.091 --> 00:16:30.988
wanting to see such things,

00:16:31.108 --> 00:16:34.426
wanting to enjoy such things.

00:16:34.546 --> 00:16:38.706
That lurking attraction is still there,

00:16:38.826 --> 00:16:42.026
your Mooladhara cannot strengthen.

00:16:43.710 --> 00:16:49.439
And we have to realize that I'm talking to Western people.

00:16:49.559 --> 00:16:54.287
I would not say the same to the people from India.

00:16:55.690 --> 00:16:59.866
So now we have to work out much harder.

00:16:59.986 --> 00:17:06.413
To be on the watch-out, to deal with yourself.

00:17:06.533 --> 00:17:12.631
And it is more a mental activity.

00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:19.227
“Mental” meaning I mean the emotional side.

00:17:19.347 --> 00:17:22.153
You have to watch your mind.

00:17:22.273 --> 00:17:26.926
In English, it's a very funny word “mind” is. But “Mana”,

00:17:27.046 --> 00:17:34.630
through which we cater to our emotional side, to our desires.

00:17:36.482 --> 00:17:38.983
Where is it going?

00:17:39.103 --> 00:17:42.143
Where is this movement of our mind?

00:17:42.263 --> 00:17:44.914
What is it doing?

00:17:45.034 --> 00:17:47.776
You have to stand against your mind,

00:17:47.896 --> 00:17:50.616
stand against your desires,

00:17:50.736 --> 00:17:52.796
or you can face it

00:17:52.916 --> 00:17:58.386
and see for yourself clearly what's happening.

00:17:59.324 --> 00:18:02.818
It's for you to decide.

00:18:02.956 --> 00:18:07.352
Nobody is going to correct you on this point.

00:18:07.472 --> 00:18:10.141
I know you people have been confessing to Me.

00:18:10.261 --> 00:18:12.484
I never read your letters, to be very frank.

00:18:12.604 --> 00:18:15.459
Whatever letters you sent, I would not read it.

00:18:15.579 --> 00:18:17.416
Whatever confessions you have made,

00:18:17.536 --> 00:18:19.936
I burnt all those letters.

00:18:20.056 --> 00:18:23.913
I haven't got any idea as to what you did.

00:18:24.033 --> 00:18:26.215
Nor do I want to know about it.

00:18:26.335 --> 00:18:29.776
That's not My concern.

00:18:29.896 --> 00:18:34.063
My concern is that now

00:18:34.183 --> 00:18:41.823
you do not dwell upon the same ideas,

00:18:42.816 --> 00:18:46.692
on the same level,

00:18:46.812 --> 00:18:51.293
or on any level whatsoever, we can say.

00:18:53.466 --> 00:18:57.496
It is in thoughtless awareness you can combat

00:18:57.616 --> 00:19:00.690
the thoughts that come to you

00:19:00.810 --> 00:19:03.178
from wrong type of Mooladhara.

00:19:03.298 --> 00:19:07.819
Maybe some of you have got bhoots on your Mooladhara.

00:19:08.852 --> 00:19:14.451
And we have some physical treatment for such bhoots also,

00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:19.185
which I'll tell to Gavin sometime,

00:19:19.305 --> 00:19:21.544
which you can ask.

00:19:21.664 --> 00:19:23.437
But you cannot always say that,

00:19:23.557 --> 00:19:26.137
“It is a bhoot and I'm all right. I'm away from the bhoot.”

00:19:26.257 --> 00:19:29.076
You are not. Whenever you say, “I have a bhoot,”

00:19:29.203 --> 00:19:33.727
means you yourself you’re siding with the bhoot.

00:19:38.674 --> 00:19:47.051
You see a person as a Sakshi.

00:19:47.171 --> 00:19:50.777
That means you see that person

00:19:50.897 --> 00:19:55.309
but you do not get a reaction,

00:19:55.429 --> 00:20:02.060
which is killer of joy.

00:20:04.369 --> 00:20:10.026
You yourself can feel your Mooladharas very well.

00:20:10.146 --> 00:20:18.064
You can feel it on your fingertips also.

00:20:18.237 --> 00:20:21.372
And be alert about it.

00:20:21.492 --> 00:20:25.347
If you want to be kind to yourself,

00:20:25.529 --> 00:20:31.423
know that you have to divert your attention

00:20:31.543 --> 00:20:34.630
towards a sane married life.

00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:38.752
But also that should not be too much.

00:20:38.872 --> 00:20:41.730
Because what I have learnt now,

00:20:41.850 --> 00:20:45.542
that in the West people have devised methods

00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:48.071
of transferring their attention

00:20:48.191 --> 00:20:51.982
from one person to another.

00:20:52.303 --> 00:20:55.955
Mental acrobatics of different type

00:20:56.075 --> 00:21:01.803
they have devised to destroy their pure attention.

00:21:01.923 --> 00:21:06.176
Don’t play onto these.

00:21:10.942 --> 00:21:14.943
There are so many other things by which

00:21:15.063 --> 00:21:19.165
we express that we are still under the trap

00:21:19.285 --> 00:21:21.119
of a bad Mooladhara.

00:21:21.239 --> 00:21:23.554
The way you dress up, the way you walk,

00:21:23.674 --> 00:21:27.147
the way you sit, the way you talk,

00:21:27.267 --> 00:21:38.488
the way you behave, to impress other people.

00:21:39.962 --> 00:21:45.287
I am to be impressed by other people in Sahaja Yoga itself.

00:21:45.407 --> 00:21:48.439
The only impression that should really work

00:21:48.559 --> 00:21:54.978
is the height of ascent that others have achieved.

00:21:57.004 --> 00:21:59.557
You can do it; it's not difficult.

00:21:59.677 --> 00:22:03.298
When the Kundalini can rise with all such shattered

00:22:03.418 --> 00:22:08.127
Mooladharas, I'm sure you can cure your Mooladhara completely.

00:22:08.262 --> 00:22:12.509
But your question is first of all

00:22:12.629 --> 00:22:15.306
of strengthening the Mooladhara,

00:22:15.426 --> 00:22:21.131
for which I think you all have to go into a kind of tapasya.

00:22:22.292 --> 00:22:24.669
That's why I say sometimes

00:22:24.789 --> 00:22:29.001
that the Western people should take to less of meat,

00:22:29.121 --> 00:22:33.829
especially the red meats and beefs,

00:22:33.949 --> 00:22:38.716
and horses, and dogs

00:22:40.770 --> 00:22:44.924
and I don't know what else you eat.

00:22:48.914 --> 00:22:51.896
Take more to vegetarian food.

00:22:52.016 --> 00:22:55.536
I'm not saying vegetarianism, you understand that.

00:22:55.656 --> 00:22:57.232
Take more to things

00:22:57.352 --> 00:23:01.077
which do not give you so much heat in the body.

00:23:02.657 --> 00:23:06.730
Even fish is very [inaudible].

00:23:07.589 --> 00:23:11.739
So take to a life which is in a way ascetic,

00:23:11.859 --> 00:23:17.400
but don't take to these horrible health foods also.

00:23:17.536 --> 00:23:19.900
I can't tolerate them I tell you.

00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:23.249
They're not meant for human beings, but for animals I think.

00:23:23.369 --> 00:23:28.017
They churn your stomach completely, and it's horrible.

00:23:28.137 --> 00:23:32.622
This Country Store thing I took once and I said “had enough of it!”

00:23:32.884 --> 00:23:36.616
Country Store - the whole country went into My stomach.

00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:43.356
So for you people,

00:23:43.507 --> 00:23:45.739
(You have to go?)

00:23:46.289 --> 00:23:55.148
Those who are suffering from Mooladhara must know

00:23:55.306 --> 00:24:00.733
that food does make a difference

00:24:00.853 --> 00:24:04.643
in the powers of Mooladhara.

00:24:05.267 --> 00:24:09.365
So if you have to get it cured, first of all

00:24:09.485 --> 00:24:13.021
you have to soothe it down, it is over-excited,

00:24:13.141 --> 00:24:15.765
over-excited.

00:24:15.885 --> 00:24:18.444
Any man you touch, any woman you touch,

00:24:18.564 --> 00:24:20.137
any woman you look at ...

00:24:20.257 --> 00:24:23.761
I just don't understand, it's worse than monkeys.

00:24:24.245 --> 00:24:26.218
Horrible.

00:24:26.338 --> 00:24:29.599
You have to soothe it down, cool it down,

00:24:29.719 --> 00:24:35.217
so that Ganesha bestows His blessings upon your Mooladhara.

00:24:35.337 --> 00:24:37.980
There's no grace.

00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:41.391
But it's not so outside that I can say that,

00:24:41.511 --> 00:24:44.536
“you must respect yourself.”

00:24:44.656 --> 00:24:48.265
It cannot work out with those words I know.

00:24:52.882 --> 00:24:56.909
You have to sit down,

00:24:57.029 --> 00:25:03.039
do meditation and try to soothe it down.

00:25:05.926 --> 00:25:07.651
I'll discuss with Gavin and I’ll tell him

00:25:07.771 --> 00:25:09.170
what things can be done about it,

00:25:09.290 --> 00:25:13.134
because I can't tell you in the open like this.

00:25:13.254 --> 00:25:17.303
But still this is all physical.

00:25:17.423 --> 00:25:22.401
Mentally you must be on the watch

00:25:22.521 --> 00:25:26.932
to see where does this mind go - to dirty things.

00:25:27.074 --> 00:25:31.970
Why does it always go to this sensation?

00:25:32.476 --> 00:25:39.333
See the birds, see the flowers, see the nature,

00:25:39.453 --> 00:25:45.159
see the beautiful people, just see them.

00:25:47.081 --> 00:25:49.283
Another horrible thing in the West

00:25:49.403 --> 00:25:51.872
is that the women must expose their body

00:25:51.992 --> 00:25:54.273
to get men excited.

00:25:54.393 --> 00:25:56.331
Men do the same I think.

00:25:56.451 --> 00:25:58.100
They always try to excite each other

00:25:58.220 --> 00:26:02.042
and live in a stupid excitement.

00:26:05.233 --> 00:26:10.292
You have to expose beautiful things, like flowers,

00:26:10.412 --> 00:26:13.259
beautiful ornaments.

00:26:13.379 --> 00:26:18.273
All right? But you're not a thing!

00:26:20.794 --> 00:26:30.105
It's your private property.

00:26:30.638 --> 00:26:34.949
You don't put all your gold on the streets, do you?

00:26:35.069 --> 00:26:38.197
Better try that, sometimes.

00:26:38.317 --> 00:26:41.746
You will mind people plundering your gold,

00:26:41.866 --> 00:26:45.446
but you don't mind your chastity being plundered.

00:26:45.566 --> 00:26:49.352
Everyone looking at you with dirty eyes.

00:26:49.472 --> 00:26:51.374
You don't feel insulted?

00:26:51.494 --> 00:26:55.274
Because ego is a dirty stuff. It does not mind.

00:26:55.394 --> 00:26:59.747
It feels happy that people are watching you.

00:27:02.302 --> 00:27:04.135
They are plundering you.

00:27:04.255 --> 00:27:07.734
They are looting your chastity.

00:27:12.509 --> 00:27:15.929
But Sahaja Yogis are not like that.

00:27:16.049 --> 00:27:20.571
But still I must say you must cleanse your hearts,

00:27:20.691 --> 00:27:26.913
cleanse your minds, take yourself out of it.

00:27:31.968 --> 00:27:36.404
The minds are very funnily placed,

00:27:36.524 --> 00:27:40.171
and that's why the greatest complications there are

00:27:40.291 --> 00:27:43.458
in the brains of people.

00:27:43.578 --> 00:27:46.764
They are very confused,

00:27:46.884 --> 00:27:50.474
very confused people.

00:27:50.807 --> 00:27:53.920
Because there is no wisdom in this kind of life.

00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:59.093
You become just a sex-oriented personality.

00:28:00.089 --> 00:28:03.065
It is actually just the other way round.

00:28:03.185 --> 00:28:06.925
If you are money-oriented, you want to preserve money.

00:28:07.045 --> 00:28:10.188
If you are possession-oriented you want to preserve it.

00:28:10.308 --> 00:28:13.401
If you get one little antique piece you want to preserve it.

00:28:13.521 --> 00:28:15.960
And why not this property of yours

00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:17.700
which is the highest of all,

00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:21.624
to be preserved, to be adorned,

00:28:21.744 --> 00:28:24.566
to be worshipped?

00:28:28.953 --> 00:28:31.919
I'm quite worried on that point

00:28:32.039 --> 00:28:38.362
that secretly people are indulging into such things.

00:28:38.482 --> 00:28:40.531
And they’re hypocritical sometimes,

00:28:40.651 --> 00:28:42.834
they don't mind being hypocritical about it.

00:28:42.954 --> 00:28:45.497
They are Sahaja Yogis, all right,

00:28:45.617 --> 00:28:48.236
but in this matter they think they can go about

00:28:48.356 --> 00:28:51.098
the way they like. And sometimes some of them say that

00:28:51.218 --> 00:28:55.166
“Mother has said it’s all right.” I never said so!

00:28:55.286 --> 00:28:59.454
There's one point I cannot compromise is this.

00:29:00.733 --> 00:29:03.560
You must have a chaste outlook towards yourself,

00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:06.268
towards your life, towards your being,

00:29:06.388 --> 00:29:10.323
towards your personality. You are saints.

00:29:11.159 --> 00:29:14.060
And if a saint doesn't have a good character,

00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:17.083
I call it the character, the essence of character,

00:29:17.203 --> 00:29:19.811
is not a saint.

00:29:24.205 --> 00:29:26.942
So this purity has to be maintained.

00:29:27.062 --> 00:29:30.455
There cannot be any compromise on that.

00:29:30.575 --> 00:29:34.547
You cannot hit at the roots of everything.

00:29:35.268 --> 00:29:38.752
If it works out,

00:29:38.932 --> 00:29:43.498
in a collective way, nobody cheats oneself,

00:29:43.618 --> 00:29:46.779
nobody deceives oneself

00:29:47.424 --> 00:29:51.349
and put the mind into right track of ascent.

00:29:51.469 --> 00:29:54.685
Thinking about the ascent, how you are going to rise,

00:29:54.805 --> 00:29:57.325
thinking of the moments when you had the joys,

00:29:57.445 --> 00:29:59.968
thinking of the day where you met Me first,

00:30:00.088 --> 00:30:04.351
thinking of all the other beautiful and holy things,

00:30:04.471 --> 00:30:08.468
your mind can be cleansed.

00:30:09.153 --> 00:30:12.671
And whenever such a thought comes in, you have to say,

00:30:12.791 --> 00:30:16.750
“not this, not this, not this.”

00:30:17.636 --> 00:30:21.727
It's more mental than physical, I tell you.

00:30:22.958 --> 00:30:25.507
I know it's difficult,

00:30:25.627 --> 00:30:29.874
but if you can get realization why not this also?

00:30:32.012 --> 00:30:33.909
You all have to understand

00:30:34.029 --> 00:30:36.456
that there is no compromise on this.

00:30:36.576 --> 00:30:39.464
And a day may come, if you continue with it,

00:30:39.584 --> 00:30:41.934
you will be thrown away completely,

00:30:42.054 --> 00:30:46.434
just like any other devil is thrown out.

00:30:48.610 --> 00:30:51.396
So there is no compromise. Tell yourself,

00:30:51.516 --> 00:30:55.036
don't deceive yourself, don't cheat yourself.

00:30:55.162 --> 00:30:56.794
You cannot ascend

00:30:56.914 --> 00:31:00.885
if there is any lurking thing within you.

00:31:01.005 --> 00:31:04.003
You will be dragged down, because that's your weakness,

00:31:04.123 --> 00:31:08.728
and you will become weaker, and weaker and weaker.

00:31:09.161 --> 00:31:12.842
Only question is “where is your attention?”

00:31:12.962 --> 00:31:18.265
Divert. Divert your attention.

00:31:20.748 --> 00:31:25.386
First you will need some exercise, some effort,

00:31:25.506 --> 00:31:31.768
and afterwards it will come automatically.

00:31:31.888 --> 00:31:35.539
You won't have to exert, you won't have to worry.

00:31:35.659 --> 00:31:38.549
On the contrary,

00:31:39.582 --> 00:31:43.654
it will become impossible how to be otherwise.

00:31:45.549 --> 00:31:47.991
So much conditioning is there.

00:31:48.111 --> 00:31:51.604
We have played into the hands of conditioning,

00:31:51.870 --> 00:31:54.730
we have ruined ourselves.

00:31:54.850 --> 00:31:57.459
This conditioning is the subtlest of all,

00:31:57.579 --> 00:32:00.516
and the worst of all.

00:32:00.636 --> 00:32:04.120
It’s impossible to combat in Sahaja Yoga,

00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:06.131
unless and until you individually

00:32:06.282 --> 00:32:10.338
take up the responsibility of looking after it.

00:32:15.917 --> 00:32:19.238
Mooladhara is one of the most delicate,

00:32:19.358 --> 00:32:23.959
and the most powerful chakra.

00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:32.517
It has so many folds and it has so many dimensions.

00:32:34.676 --> 00:32:39.820
If your Mooladhara is not all right, your memory will fail.

00:32:39.940 --> 00:32:42.794
If your Mooladhara is not all right, to begin with,

00:32:42.914 --> 00:32:45.854
your wisdom will fail.

00:32:49.891 --> 00:32:52.826
You will have no sense of direction.

00:32:52.946 --> 00:32:56.700
The insanity that is now crawling up in America

00:32:56.820 --> 00:32:58.793
before they become forty years of age

00:32:58.913 --> 00:33:01.454
is because their Mooladharas are out.

00:33:01.574 --> 00:33:04.997
Most of the diseases which are incurable

00:33:05.117 --> 00:33:09.283
come because of weak Mooladharas,

00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:12.718
on the physical side.

00:33:12.838 --> 00:33:14.841
On the mental side,

00:33:14.961 --> 00:33:18.135
most of the mental problems we saw there,

00:33:18.255 --> 00:33:23.919
most, I would say ninety percent,

00:33:24.039 --> 00:33:26.463
are due to weak Mooladhara.

00:33:26.583 --> 00:33:29.584
If a person has a strong Mooladhara,

00:33:29.704 --> 00:33:32.766
powerful Mooladhara,

00:33:32.886 --> 00:33:35.686
it doesn't get into trouble.

00:33:35.806 --> 00:33:38.724
Because you know there's a very strong hold

00:33:38.844 --> 00:33:42.409
of the Mooladhara in the back there.

00:33:42.529 --> 00:33:47.845
And when your mind goes off,

00:33:50.954 --> 00:33:54.000
you blame the brain.

00:33:54.208 --> 00:33:59.435
It's not the brain, mostly it is the Mooladhara.

00:33:59.555 --> 00:34:03.578
So for physical safety and for your emotional safety also,

00:34:03.698 --> 00:34:11.689
you have to have a sane type of attitude towards Mooladhara.

00:34:13.442 --> 00:34:17.226
That's why I'm very anxious that you all should get married,

00:34:17.346 --> 00:34:20.432
and after marriage, after a few days, you find

00:34:20.552 --> 00:34:26.826
that your attention starts diverting to other problems of married life.

00:34:28.992 --> 00:34:33.609
But not if you are not a Sahaja Yogi,

00:34:34.336 --> 00:34:38.340
because the sensationalization

00:34:38.460 --> 00:34:41.783
has become the main theme of modern life.

00:34:41.903 --> 00:34:48.402
And you are tossed about on the rough sea

00:34:48.522 --> 00:34:52.687
of all these deliberate actions of the people.

00:34:52.807 --> 00:35:00.866
Media, books, ideas, everything,

00:35:01.239 --> 00:35:07.219
creates this horrible excitable temperament within you.

00:35:10.289 --> 00:35:12.491
Such a person doesn't have any patience,

00:35:12.611 --> 00:35:17.573
doesn't have any balance.

00:35:18.083 --> 00:35:20.241
Actually he's hypocritical,

00:35:20.361 --> 00:35:24.853
and has a very bad left Vishuddhi.

00:35:24.973 --> 00:35:28.185
So many complications take place with this.

00:35:28.318 --> 00:35:32.335
Before realization, forget the past.

00:35:33.107 --> 00:35:35.506
Whatever you have done, forget it.

00:35:35.626 --> 00:35:38.000
Just don't worry.

00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:40.037
But remember one thing,

00:35:40.157 --> 00:35:42.926
that you have damaged your Mooladhara.

00:35:43.046 --> 00:35:46.172
So you have to look after it, you have to soothe it down,

00:35:46.292 --> 00:35:48.742
you have to bring it to normalcy.

00:35:48.862 --> 00:35:54.397
You have to make it a healthy,

00:35:55.920 --> 00:36:00.720
balanced center,

00:36:00.868 --> 00:36:07.029
so that Shri Ganesha can rule over it.

00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:14.338
Talking about Shri Ganesha,

00:36:14.458 --> 00:36:19.026
you know vibrations become too much for Me.

00:36:20.055 --> 00:36:22.492
We talk of innocence,

00:36:22.612 --> 00:36:25.329
but to awaken innocence within ourselves

00:36:25.449 --> 00:36:30.119
we must be on the full watch,

00:36:30.239 --> 00:36:35.397
on the full alertness about our minds.

00:36:35.517 --> 00:36:38.154
What is it thinking? Where is it going?

00:36:38.274 --> 00:36:40.497
Where is this thief going?

00:36:40.617 --> 00:36:43.179
Is he trying to do some tricks?

00:36:43.299 --> 00:36:46.817
Is he up to some tricks? All right!

00:36:46.937 --> 00:36:50.767
You have to be alert, very alert.

00:36:51.377 --> 00:36:55.286
I’ve been thinking of talking about it since long.

00:36:55.406 --> 00:36:58.372
But now I have to tell you one thing.

00:36:58.497 --> 00:37:00.089
That you'll be exposed.

00:37:00.209 --> 00:37:02.879
That is another quality of Mahamaya.

00:37:02.999 --> 00:37:04.929
She'll expose you.

00:37:05.049 --> 00:37:07.906
You'll be exposed

00:37:08.026 --> 00:37:11.585
if you try to play tricks with Me.

00:37:11.744 --> 00:37:14.225
“With Me” means with your Kundalini.

00:37:14.345 --> 00:37:17.039
If you try to play tricks with your Kundalini,

00:37:17.159 --> 00:37:19.769
you'll be exposed.

00:37:19.889 --> 00:37:23.130
And you'll be ashamed of yourself.

00:37:24.017 --> 00:37:28.184
So please be careful, very careful about it,

00:37:28.304 --> 00:37:34.548
that you again make your Mooladhara very healthy,

00:37:34.668 --> 00:37:37.685
and powerful.

00:37:37.827 --> 00:37:41.110
May God bless you!

00:37:48.541 --> 00:37:51.257
So our prayer should be that

00:37:51.377 --> 00:37:56.347
“Let our Mooladhara be healthy and strong.”

00:37:56.467 --> 00:37:59.932
That's all. Let’s pray.

00:38:12.090 --> 00:38:14.805
There are certain exercises for Mooladhara.

00:38:14.925 --> 00:38:21.018
I will explain to Gavin who is your leader in England.

00:38:21.138 --> 00:38:22.896
Then he will pass it on to you.

00:38:23.016 --> 00:38:28.657
It should be done verbally. It should not be written down.

00:38:28.777 --> 00:38:31.840
The leaders of the ashrams and other places

00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:36.540
should come and see him every month sometime,

00:38:36.660 --> 00:38:40.912
and these things should be talked.

00:38:42.783 --> 00:38:46.641
Because it's a secret,

00:38:46.761 --> 00:38:48.124
not to be discussed openly.

00:38:48.244 --> 00:38:52.109
It's a secret, between you and yourself.

00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:56.693
It should not be written down anywhere.

00:38:56.813 --> 00:38:58.962
It should not be mentioned,

00:38:59.082 --> 00:39:02.526
but should be worked out by all of you,

00:39:02.646 --> 00:39:08.256
in such a way that you enjoy the bliss of Shri Ganesha.

00:39:09.961 --> 00:39:13.961
Is more for the ladies, I would say, than for the men.

00:39:14.081 --> 00:39:18.299
Because men suffer much more than women do.

00:39:20.569 --> 00:39:24.410
And that's why women must be very careful.

00:39:24.530 --> 00:39:29.587
Develop very good relationships with your brothers.

00:39:32.764 --> 00:39:41.507
Unless and until you really establish your high character,

00:39:41.627 --> 00:39:45.319
men cannot be improved.

00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:48.655
You have seen in India women don’t like it

00:39:48.775 --> 00:39:51.057
if anyone tries to look at them, or tries to touch them.

00:39:51.177 --> 00:39:52.874
They don't like it.

00:39:52.994 --> 00:39:56.303
Women have killed themselves, burnt themselves up,

00:39:56.423 --> 00:40:00.827
thousands of them, because they thought some

00:40:01.007 --> 00:40:05.189
other people may come and touch their body.

00:40:06.445 --> 00:40:14.090
It's so related to your Atma, to your Spirit.

00:40:14.761 --> 00:40:17.693
As if it is the body,

00:40:17.853 --> 00:40:21.054
innocence is the body of your Spirit.

00:40:26.248 --> 00:40:30.697
You all can be that, because you have become yoginis now.

00:40:30.817 --> 00:40:34.622
They were not yoginis, but they knew one thing

00:40:34.742 --> 00:40:38.545
the power of their chastity.

00:40:39.475 --> 00:40:41.877
It's more for ladies here,

00:40:41.997 --> 00:40:47.144
that they should try to generate that feeling

00:40:47.264 --> 00:40:50.880
of nobility, of chastity,

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:53.681
of holiness around them,

00:40:53.801 --> 00:40:59.085
so that the men themselves respect them

00:40:59.323 --> 00:41:03.857
and develop that feeling within themselves.

00:41:08.007 --> 00:41:10.567
Thank you very much.
