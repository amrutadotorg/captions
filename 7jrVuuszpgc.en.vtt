ADVICE ON SAHAJA YOGINIS

00:00:28.637 --> 00:00:36.605
PART 1 “HOW MUCH DO YOU KNOW DEEPLY
ABOUT SAHAJA YOGA?”

00:00:39.248 --> 00:00:42.303
So, I have to request you people, first
and foremost thing,

00:00:42.504 --> 00:00:47.364
all the Sahaja Yoginis must know Sahaja
Yoga as well as the men know.

00:00:47.565 --> 00:00:51.693
Not just smiling and dressing up
is important.

00:00:51.894 --> 00:00:57.245
In Sahaja Yoga, you must have the same
knowledge as any Sahaja Yogi has.

00:00:57.446 --> 00:01:00.581
If you have produced children it doesn’t
mean that you have achieved something great.

00:01:00.782 --> 00:01:06.104
Anybody can produce children: dogs, cats,
everyone.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.698
Also your husbands are responsible partly
for it.

00:01:11.422 --> 00:01:13.994
So nothing you have achieved great
by producing children,

00:01:14.195 --> 00:01:18.596
looking after the children, dominating
your husband all the time.

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:20.758
How much do you know about Sahaja Yoga?

00:01:20.959 --> 00:01:26.035
I know some of them do not know what are
the chakras on the feet.

00:01:26.544 --> 00:01:28.547
They don’t want to know anything about
Sahaja Yoga.

00:01:28.748 --> 00:01:33.266
Only they want to use Sahaja Yoga sometimes
to dominate the husbands.

00:01:33.467 --> 00:01:39.446
One has to face it up. How much do you know
deeply about Sahaja Yoga?

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.821
Most of you have so many problems
within yourselves.

00:01:45.022 --> 00:01:48.422
As I have seen, some of you, as soon as you
put hands towards someone,

00:01:48.623 --> 00:01:51.196
you feel, “Oh, here. I’m catching here,
I’m catching here.”

00:01:51.397 --> 00:01:55.504
That’s the sign of a regular bhoot in you.

00:01:55.771 --> 00:01:59.522
And I have seen people saying that
they are sensitive.

00:01:59.723 --> 00:02:02.287
It’s such a misleading thing.

00:02:02.488 --> 00:02:06.226
“I’m very sensitive. I’m very much higher
in Sahaja Yoga.”

00:02:06.427 --> 00:02:08.616
That’s not the way you are going to be
higher.

00:02:08.817 --> 00:02:13.108
You have to be absolutely perfect,
in perfect health

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:16.847
and perfect knowledge about Sahaja Yoga
you should have.

00:02:17.048 --> 00:02:20.105
How many of you have read Advent?
Let us see.

00:02:20.306 --> 00:02:24.183
How many of you have read full Advent?

00:02:28.805 --> 00:02:31.355
All right. That’s good!

00:02:31.556 --> 00:02:35.879
How many English girls have read Advent?

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:42.465
Honestly! Honestly! That’s good!

00:02:42.666 --> 00:02:49.777
Now, what I’m trying to say, that you have
to find out

00:02:51.187 --> 00:02:56.988
what is Sahaja Yoga. Your Guru is a woman!

00:02:57.189 --> 00:03:03.761
She is the source of all the knowledge.
She is the Ocean of All the Knowledge.

00:03:03.962 --> 00:03:07.971
And why should you lag behind?
In all things you want to be absolutely

00:03:08.172 --> 00:03:12.754
equal, similar to men, even in dressing up
and everything.

00:03:12.955 --> 00:03:16.918
And what about in knowledge about
Sahaja Yoga?

00:03:19.142 --> 00:03:23.391
How many have given Realisations to others?
Raise your hands.

00:03:23.592 --> 00:03:26.973
Only the women I’m interested in.

00:03:28.764 --> 00:03:34.766
It’s good. So that is what one should be
proud of.

00:03:34.967 --> 00:03:38.208
One should know how much you know
Sahaja Yoga

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:43.030
mentally, emotionally.

00:03:43.231 --> 00:03:47.491
How many of you dominate your husband?

00:03:47.692 --> 00:03:51.670
Be careful, she is the only honest person,
I think.

00:03:51.871 --> 00:03:59.098
I know all of you who dominate and try
to crush them also, sometimes.

00:03:59.527 --> 00:04:02.522
I’m requesting you now because you are
the shakti.

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:09.553
You are the power behind the man. You are
the one who are going to make them great.

00:04:09.754 --> 00:04:16.545
You are the one who are going to build up
Sahaja Yoga as a potential energy.

00:04:16.892 --> 00:04:19.896
You are like this Mother Earth who has
to give everything beautiful.

00:04:20.097 --> 00:04:24.139
All these flowers, from where do they come?
All these trees?

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.975
This Mother Earth looks so simple.

00:04:28.684 --> 00:04:35.113
But what She gives us, look at that. Look
at those beautiful things.

00:04:37.105 --> 00:04:41.733
So one has to understand that to be a good
Sahaja Yogini,

00:04:41.934 --> 00:04:45.998
first of all you have to be an excellent
wife.

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:50.256
And not a dominating wife, pushing yourself
forward all the time.

00:04:51.613 --> 00:04:55.030
Now, the deep problem I find is this,
it’s the women,

00:04:55.231 --> 00:05:00.248
who are supposed to be my disciples,
will be spoiling Sahaja Yoga.

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:07.147
Very clearly I can see it now. I can see it
so clearly, absolutely clearly.

00:05:07.363 --> 00:05:12.405
They are going to spoil because they have
become very dominating.

00:05:12.606 --> 00:05:15.670
Because they think they know Sahaja Yoga.

00:05:15.871 --> 00:05:19.287
Because they think they have become
very great.

00:05:19.488 --> 00:05:23.459
A leader’s wife thinks she is the leader
herself.

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:27.084
If you call somebody that: “All right, come
and do this major/my job for me,”

00:05:27.285 --> 00:05:32.340
the wife thinks she has a right
on her husband more than Mother has.

00:05:34.543 --> 00:05:39.577
Is the women who are the culprit today
and that’s why I want to warn you.

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:52.834
PART 2 “THIS IS SO IMPORTANT, THAT
OUR HAMSA SHOULD BE ALL RIGHT”

00:05:56.754 --> 00:06:02.637
Gruha Lakshmi is the woman who should know
that she has the great responsibility

00:06:02.838 --> 00:06:07.793
of creating a very great society of Sahaja
Yoga.

00:06:08.704 --> 00:06:11.262
She is not an ordinary woman.

00:06:11.463 --> 00:06:17.646
How many women got their realization
before?

00:06:18.502 --> 00:06:23.894
But in Sahaja Yoga if you find the ladies,
you hardly find very few

00:06:24.095 --> 00:06:32.224
who are really alert. Most of them are
in trance condition.

00:06:33.285 --> 00:06:36.138
They don't know anything.

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:43.457
They don't know anything. They don't know
much of cooking,

00:06:43.658 --> 00:06:47.652
you ask them anything, they don't know
anything.

00:06:47.853 --> 00:06:51.512
You talk to them, you feel as if

00:06:54.400 --> 00:07:01.098
they have taken some sort of a drug.
Nothing goes into their heads.

00:07:01.299 --> 00:07:07.075
Sometimes one feels, it's better I do it
Myself, impossible.

00:07:10.837 --> 00:07:16.824
The alertness is gone, because alertness
that comes

00:07:17.025 --> 00:07:23.059
through your right side is wasted
on nonsensical things.

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:29.228
Attention is wasted on nonsensical things,
that's why

00:07:29.429 --> 00:07:35.644
the housewives have lost that discretion
to know

00:07:35.845 --> 00:07:43.833
that they have to be extremely alert
and sensible and wise.

00:07:49.884 --> 00:07:53.693
They should know each and everything.

00:07:56.398 --> 00:08:01.839
It's not so. They just live in the air,
somewhere hanging, you know.

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:06.980
You don't know what to say to them, how
to ask for anything,

00:08:07.181 --> 00:08:12.503
how to explain anything to them - is
an impossible situation.

00:08:18.938 --> 00:08:29.128
So that alertness has to be there
in a housewife - is extremely important.

00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:37.947
But if you do not have the alertness, then
you cannot be a Gruha Lakshmi,

00:08:38.148 --> 00:08:45.792
you cannot be a good mother, you cannot be
a good wife.

00:08:48.868 --> 00:08:52.347
There’s no slavery in it.

00:08:54.149 --> 00:09:02.082
They don't know even what pleases
their husbands,

00:09:03.594 --> 00:09:07.151
how to create peace in the family,

00:09:07.352 --> 00:09:13.690
what to say, when to say

00:09:15.782 --> 00:09:24.285
beautiful things and when to be strict.
All this discretion is not there.

00:09:24.844 --> 00:09:32.116
Either they are shrews or they are slaves.

00:09:39.917 --> 00:09:47.770
So, Sahaja Yoga is meant for women who
are alert, who are wise,

00:09:47.971 --> 00:09:53.192
who know everything about life.

00:09:53.393 --> 00:09:57.027
Even they don't know where are the chakras
on the feet.

00:09:57.228 --> 00:10:03.654
Look at your Mother. She is a woman.
She knows so much.

00:10:05.744 --> 00:10:15.642
They don't know anything as to how
Kundalini passes through these centers,

00:10:15.843 --> 00:10:19.556
what it does, what She is capable of.

00:10:19.757 --> 00:10:22.306
But the Kundalini itself is the feminine
Power.

00:10:22.507 --> 00:10:32.380
She knows each and everything about you,
about Her child.

00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:40.591
Many mothers don't know if the child is
taking drugs, or is behaving which way.

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:48.238
Except for spoiling or beating, there’s
nothing in between.

00:10:51.736 --> 00:11:06.333
With discretion, the mothers can make these
special children into something.

00:11:06.552 --> 00:11:10.099
That is My vision about them.

00:11:10.615 --> 00:11:16.865
But with their indiscretion they can ruin
these children completely.

00:11:21.766 --> 00:11:30.765
This is so important, that our Hamsa

00:11:30.966 --> 00:11:37.228
should be all right, that we should be able

00:11:37.429 --> 00:11:44.954
to create a beautiful home, a peaceful
home - not only for our family,

00:11:45.155 --> 00:11:50.424
but for all the other Sahaja Yogis who come
to our house.

00:11:56.505 --> 00:12:04.752
PART 3 “SO MY ONE DEMAND TODAY IS THAT
YOU MUST NOT CRY”

00:12:07.086 --> 00:12:11.508
I’ve noticed – of course, I’m also
a woman –

00:12:11.709 --> 00:12:18.196
that women have certain water powers
of crying, weeping

00:12:18.397 --> 00:12:24.252
and, thinking they are very miserable and
making everybody miserable.

00:12:24.453 --> 00:12:26.594
This is their power.

00:12:27.334 --> 00:12:32.750
So inside every woman, there is
a motherhood,

00:12:32.951 --> 00:12:39.688
there’s great capacities, sacrifice,
everything is there.

00:12:39.889 --> 00:12:45.411
But with that, they also should know
they are left-sided.

00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:56.414
And our joy about which we talk within
our heart

00:12:57.818 --> 00:13:00.992
has to manifest outside.

00:13:01.193 --> 00:13:06.140
People should see that we are joyous,
that we are happy people,

00:13:06.341 --> 00:13:12.013
that we are not like others who start
crying for small things.

00:13:12.802 --> 00:13:15.091
Like when My father died,

00:13:15.292 --> 00:13:19.973
I was surprised that suddenly I became
thoughtless, absolutely thoughtless.

00:13:20.174 --> 00:13:22.958
For about three days I was thoughtless.

00:13:23.159 --> 00:13:28.396
Neither the thought of pain or thought
of unhappiness or anything came up,

00:13:28.573 --> 00:13:31.396
but just thoughtless.

00:13:34.581 --> 00:13:38.872
And everyone was surprised, because
I looked after him

00:13:39.073 --> 00:13:44.013
and, I mean, he was very attached to Me,
very fond of me, everything was there.

00:13:44.214 --> 00:13:49.044
But they were surprised how is it I became
suddenly thoughtless.

00:13:49.245 --> 00:13:53.450
So if you are a Sahaja Yogini, then
at the time of crisis

00:13:53.651 --> 00:13:55.893
you should become thoughtless. That’s one
of the signs.

00:13:56.094 --> 00:13:59.317
I’ve seen with Myself. If there is
any crisis in the family,

00:13:59.518 --> 00:14:02.793
I just become thoughtless. That means what?

00:14:02.994 --> 00:14:09.013
That God just takes you in your problems,

00:14:10.252 --> 00:14:16.434
He puts His hand, He puts His protection
and He takes you out of it

00:14:16.635 --> 00:14:23.177
and makes you absolutely thoughtless.
And in that thoughtless

00:14:23.510 --> 00:14:30.082
awareness you discover what is right,
what is wrong.

00:14:30.283 --> 00:14:35.841
So even in crisis, this thoughtless
awareness

00:14:36.042 --> 00:14:42.568
is all the time extremely alert. It becomes
much more alert than normal.

00:14:42.801 --> 00:14:46.129
That’s the sign of a Sahaja Yogi and
the sign of Sahaja Yogini.

00:14:47.229 --> 00:14:52.517
This is another kind of ego expression,
I tell you – this crying business.

00:14:52.718 --> 00:14:59.521
So today I want to have a promise from all
of you that you are not going to cry at all.

00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:04.622
Instead of flowers, you just give me
this flower of promise.

00:15:04.825 --> 00:15:10.665
I never cry. Of course, sometimes
Sandra karuna,

00:15:10.873 --> 00:15:16.970
one tear or two tears might come out
of My eyes. After all, I’m a mother.

00:15:17.171 --> 00:15:21.829
But not like this – sitting, crying,
crying, becoming hysterics.

00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:25.376
[You] must have your dignity, you are all
Sahaja Yoginis.

00:15:25.577 --> 00:15:30.544
Don’t read any book which talks of crying,

00:15:33.382 --> 00:15:38.952
but books which are deep also make you feel
very much touched.

00:15:39.153 --> 00:15:42.226
You feel like crying, it’s all right.

00:15:42.427 --> 00:15:47.757
In the cinema they see a woman torturing
her husband, there they will cry.

00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:52.685
At home they’ll come and torture
the husband. What’s the use?

00:15:54.043 --> 00:15:59.312
I have seen many like that. In the cinema
they’ll be crying.

00:15:59.513 --> 00:16:01.538
When it is somebody else, they feel
the pain.

00:16:01.739 --> 00:16:04.795
When it is themselves, they never see
what they are doing.

00:16:04.996 --> 00:16:14.241
So My one demand today is that you must
not cry.

00:16:14.442 --> 00:16:22.155
Now you are in the Kingdom of God and
in the Kingdom of God you do not cry.

00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:36.061
PART 4 “YOU SHOULD ONLY SPEAK WHENEVER
IT IS NECESSARY”

00:16:38.413 --> 00:16:41.835
Now this I would say, for the physical self
that one has to know

00:16:42.036 --> 00:16:45.170
that you are all younger and getting
younger and younger,

00:16:45.371 --> 00:16:51.577
but not the stupidity of youth, but
gravity, the gravity of the age.

00:16:51.778 --> 00:16:57.864
Actually I have seen children who are born
realised, they are very grave,

00:16:58.049 --> 00:17:02.552
they won’t do anything that is not
dignified.

00:17:02.753 --> 00:17:07.122
And they will never, I’ve never heard them
talking to -

00:17:07.323 --> 00:17:09.825
some of the Sahaja Yoginis have a bad habit
of talking,

00:17:10.026 --> 00:17:12.707
“tuk, tuk, tuk, tuk, tuk, tuk,” among
themselves. It’s a very bad habit.

00:17:12.908 --> 00:17:16.777
Which shows that they [are] still very much
lacking.

00:17:16.978 --> 00:17:20.583
Just wearing saris or wearing bindis
you do not become a Sahaja Yogini.

00:17:20.784 --> 00:17:25.254
First of all, what is the gravity? You
should only speak whenever it is necessary.

00:17:25.651 --> 00:17:30.419
So this dignity and this understanding
comes only through silence.

00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:35.184
But if you are chirping all the time,
talking “tuk, tuk, tuk, tuk, tuk, tuk, tuk,”

00:17:35.385 --> 00:17:39.614
it can never, never can make you
deeper person.

00:17:39.815 --> 00:17:42.411
You’ll be just flying in the air with all
that.

00:17:42.612 --> 00:17:46.989
So for women now is best is to take
to mauna, is to keep quiet,

00:17:47.197 --> 00:17:50.721
just keep quiet. They all the time want
to talk.

00:17:50.922 --> 00:17:55.292
This I have heard from all the leaders that
is a big problem with women.

00:17:55.493 --> 00:17:58.596
They just go on talking stories, telling
stories.

00:17:58.797 --> 00:18:05.107
But if you ask them to come and speak,
they’ll start shaking.

00:18:05.555 --> 00:18:10.669
How many can give speeches? Women?

00:18:11.203 --> 00:18:18.380
If you understand that you should, cannot
give a speech, you better not talk also.

00:18:19.148 --> 00:18:21.959
You should be able to give a speech because
your Mother is a woman,

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:25.568
She gives speeches. Why can’t you give
some speech? You cannot.

00:18:25.769 --> 00:18:28.428
If I make you stand here, you’ll be
shaking, I know that.

00:18:28.629 --> 00:18:32.154
But if it comes to murmuring souls,
you are there.

00:18:32.355 --> 00:18:35.037
So that is one thing women have to be
very careful [about].

00:18:35.238 --> 00:18:37.943
And as today is the Guru puja I have
to tell you things,

00:18:38.144 --> 00:18:41.053
not as a Mother but as your Guru.

00:18:41.254 --> 00:18:45.810
That, if you have to ascend the best thing
is for you to stop talking.

00:18:46.011 --> 00:18:49.998
“Maunam sarvatha sadhanam.” ‘Maun’ means
to keep quiet.

00:18:50.183 --> 00:18:56.443
Is the - it gives you all kinds
of facilities, just keep quiet.

00:18:56.644 --> 00:18:59.803
If somebody’s talking too much, just keep
quiet.

00:19:00.004 --> 00:19:03.609
If somebody’s trying to criticise, keep
quiet. That’s your silence,

00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:08.224
that’s your right, that’s your domain that
you can keep silent.

00:19:08.425 --> 00:19:15.029
Just watch that person. If it comes then
to answer, then you can answer, better.

00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:19.787
But if somebody is trying to attack you,
just keep silent.

00:19:19.972 --> 00:19:22.295
But this silence has to be established

00:19:22.496 --> 00:19:26.373
and one should only establish by not
talking too much.

00:19:26.574 --> 00:19:31.060
I have seen also when I am sitting here,
I have seen women talking among themselves,

00:19:31.261 --> 00:19:35.935
and this is very wrong. You must learn
the silence.

00:19:41.107 --> 00:19:49.107
PART 5 “SO ONE HAS TO MEDITATE AND ONE
HAS TO ALSO GO OUT TO SPREAD SAHAJA YOGA”

00:19:51.310 --> 00:19:58.607
Seriously we must think, are we meditating,
are we all doing something

00:19:58.808 --> 00:20:03.115
to elevate others also, to give
realizations to others?

00:20:03.316 --> 00:20:07.873
Specially women I have seen, don’t do much
of this, which is very bad,

00:20:08.074 --> 00:20:14.367
because you are the mothers. You have to go
all out to give realizations to others.

00:20:14.568 --> 00:20:20.200
But men are more active that way and women
are not. So it works the other way round.

00:20:20.401 --> 00:20:26.324
Now on one side the men are, I think are
active but don’t meditate.

00:20:26.525 --> 00:20:29.789
Women meditate and men do the outside
work,

00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:37.441
it’s sort of a part-time, or you can
call it a good labor division

00:20:37.642 --> 00:20:43.223
that, “You meditate at home and we’ll go
all out”. It’s not going to work out.

00:20:43.424 --> 00:20:52.957
So one has to meditate and one has to also
go out to spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:20:53.157 --> 00:20:56.097
Both things have to be done.

00:20:56.298 --> 00:21:00.348
Supposing now you meditate and you don’t
spread Sahaja Yoga -

00:21:00.549 --> 00:21:06.331
you will never ascend. Because after all
this Kundalini, you see,

00:21:06.532 --> 00:21:10.660
She is a sensible woman, na, She is
very sensible.

00:21:10.861 --> 00:21:17.778
She thinks, “Why should I make her a saint?
What is the use?”.

00:21:17.979 --> 00:21:21.317
Sahaja Yoga is not an individualistic
thing,

00:21:21.518 --> 00:21:27.560
it’s not for one person to become a saint
and sit somewhere, it’s not like that.

00:21:28.228 --> 00:21:32.301
It’s not meant for one person, for oneself,

00:21:32.502 --> 00:21:36.903
it’s not individualistic. It’s a collective
happening.

00:21:37.736 --> 00:21:43.651
I must say that somehow men have been
more dynamic and working it out.

00:21:43.852 --> 00:21:48.634
The women in Sahaja Yoga are not yet
coming up to that level as they should.

00:21:48.835 --> 00:21:53.025
They have to be more sensible about it,
and they have to work it out.

00:21:53.226 --> 00:21:59.691
They can do it, but only trouble is,
I think they have certain minor problems

00:21:59.892 --> 00:22:03.744
about which they are worried. Always I get
letters from ladies

00:22:03.945 --> 00:22:08.744
saying this is wrong, that is wrong,
complaining all the time;

00:22:08.945 --> 00:22:13.166
when I’m so fed up of their letters now
that I think they are

00:22:13.367 --> 00:22:18.947
useless to read them also. So I’ve to tell
you all, that it is important

00:22:19.148 --> 00:22:24.142
that men, because they are dynamic, women
should be much more,

00:22:24.343 --> 00:22:28.369
because they are shakti and I am a woman.

00:22:29.452 --> 00:22:35.965
So I find that the men are more sort
of active and dynamic about Sahaja Yoga,

00:22:36.166 --> 00:22:39.244
and I don’t know what is the reason why
women are not.

00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:47.071
They can transform so many people. They
can do so much good to others.

00:22:47.272 --> 00:22:54.314
They can bring so much love and compassion,
because this love and compassion

00:22:54.515 --> 00:22:58.166
is the quality of a mother, of a woman.

00:22:58.367 --> 00:23:03.182
And if the women don’t have that quality,
it’s useless to be a woman.

00:23:03.383 --> 00:23:08.932
All the time if you are busy about
your useless things

00:23:09.133 --> 00:23:14.549
like fashions or faces and all that, then
the time is all wasted.

00:23:14.758 --> 00:23:17.885
You have a short time now, you got
your realization

00:23:18.086 --> 00:23:23.951
and you must decide what have you done
so far, what have you achieved for so far.

00:23:29.496 --> 00:23:37.357
PART 6 “DHARMA CAN BE ESTABLISHED
MORE BY WOMEN THAN BY MEN”

00:23:40.274 --> 00:23:44.352
Can I guide myself? Have I got the light
of the Spirit

00:23:44.553 --> 00:23:48.752
on my attention so well established
and manifested

00:23:48.953 --> 00:23:55.031
that I can guide myself and guide others
later on?

00:23:55.232 --> 00:24:00.414
First of all, in the Guru principle it is
important

00:24:00.615 --> 00:24:05.547
that you see to yourself –
the introspection:

00:24:05.748 --> 00:24:12.303
Can I be my own Guru? Have I become
my own Guru?

00:24:14.967 --> 00:24:22.414
Now, in your case, your Guru is a Mother,
a woman,

00:24:22.615 --> 00:24:34.399
so, it has to be among women that
the development of their Guru qualities

00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:41.844
have to be very well manifested. But it’s
just the way it is not.

00:24:42.045 --> 00:24:45.500
For them, they are still the mothers or
they are the wives

00:24:45.701 --> 00:24:50.061
or they are Sahaja Yoginis. But they
don’t realise

00:24:50.262 --> 00:24:57.664
that you are also the Gurus. And, because
your Mother is a Guru,

00:24:57.865 --> 00:25:03.641
because She is a woman; and you have to be
also of that quality

00:25:03.842 --> 00:25:07.391
that people should say, “Look at this
woman, she is such a Guru.”

00:25:07.592 --> 00:25:11.555
But still, as I hear from the different
leaders

00:25:11.756 --> 00:25:18.289
that the ladies are absolutely still very
much far away and are very few

00:25:18.490 --> 00:25:25.570
who can be called as real Sahaja Yoginis.
It’s a sad thing to hear.

00:25:25.771 --> 00:25:34.008
Because if you still keep to all these
mundane things of womanhood

00:25:34.209 --> 00:25:39.219
and the drawbacks of womanhood, which
has come out of domination maybe,

00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:44.016
because of always, you see, they were shown
to be something lower -

00:25:44.217 --> 00:25:51.178
specially in the Christian religion they
were never regarded as something holy -

00:25:51.411 --> 00:25:56.656
they have this kind of a diffidence in them
that they don’t understand

00:25:56.857 --> 00:26:02.891
that dharma can be established more
by women than by men.

00:26:03.092 --> 00:26:07.033
And the Guru’s work is to establish
the dharma –

00:26:07.234 --> 00:26:13.172
in the society, in the family,
in relationships.

00:26:13.372 --> 00:26:18.891
All these Gurus, which are representing
all these great symbols here,

00:26:19.092 --> 00:26:22.594
have done nothing but have established
dharma.

00:26:22.795 --> 00:26:27.844
But first of all, before establishing
the dharma, we should watch ourselves –

00:26:28.045 --> 00:26:32.271
have we got dharma within ourselves
or not?

00:26:34.255 --> 00:26:41.555
First of all, the quality of a person who
has dharma is

00:26:41.756 --> 00:26:47.867
that he listens to others, he obeys.

00:26:50.256 --> 00:26:53.602
And this is something [that] has gone wrong
with the Western women, I think,

00:26:53.803 --> 00:26:59.257
that they have forgotten how to listen
to others, how to obey others.

00:26:59.458 --> 00:27:03.271
That’s why their children also don’t obey
them.

00:27:09.053 --> 00:27:16.896
PART 7 “DEVELOP THIS LOTUS OF WISDOM”

00:27:19.249 --> 00:27:22.960
It just should become innate, Sahaj.
You don’t have to work it out,

00:27:23.161 --> 00:27:26.857
but should know. “Now I’m a Sahaja Yogini.”

00:27:27.481 --> 00:27:32.241
Every morning you should tell yourself,
“I’m a Sahaja Yogini.

00:27:33.076 --> 00:27:38.148
So how far I should go? How should
I behave – I should behave?

00:27:38.349 --> 00:27:41.342
What should be my attitude?”

00:27:41.543 --> 00:27:45.445
All this can be very easily understood

00:27:45.646 --> 00:27:53.023
if you develop this lotus of wisdom.

00:27:53.597 --> 00:27:59.584
How does a lotus come out? There is a seed
which sprouts.

00:28:00.223 --> 00:28:04.687
That’s how the wisdom – there is already
the seed within you. All of you have got

00:28:04.888 --> 00:28:08.296
and now it has started opening because
you are realized souls.

00:28:08.497 --> 00:28:12.537
Allow your wisdom to take over.

00:28:13.473 --> 00:28:17.638
So how do you do it?

00:28:18.918 --> 00:28:21.359
There’s one way, I would say.

00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:27.515
“Supposing Mother had this problem, what
She would have done?” – very good idea.

00:28:32.505 --> 00:28:35.784
“How She would have dealt with it?”

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.776
You may again say that I don’t, we don’t
understand Mother’s style.

00:28:38.977 --> 00:28:43.623
See, She is full of tricks. Correct. I am.

00:28:46.304 --> 00:28:51.877
But there’s a very simple way of doing it.

00:28:52.078 --> 00:28:55.943
Can surrender it to My wisdom,

00:28:56.406 --> 00:29:02.346
and the wisdom itself that is in you who
is active, it will work.

00:29:02.547 --> 00:29:05.783
This point also we should understand.

00:29:07.132 --> 00:29:13.338
Then this lotus of your fragrance will
improve

00:29:16.218 --> 00:29:23.017
and then activity of your wisdom will be

00:29:23.218 --> 00:29:34.010
that you will take all that is very
beautiful - easily.

00:29:34.211 --> 00:29:39.120
We’ll get all that is very satisfying,
very joyous.

00:29:39.321 --> 00:29:43.940
It’s kind of an activity of this wisdom
within you

00:29:44.141 --> 00:29:49.541
which just leads you to people who are
extremely nice,

00:29:49.807 --> 00:29:55.830
to situations which are very beautiful,
where you discover nice things -

00:30:01.194 --> 00:30:12.967
or to such beautiful creations

00:30:13.168 --> 00:30:17.101
that you would never expect to see.

00:30:19.648 --> 00:30:25.424
It’s very, very important to understand
that you tell Me,

00:30:25.625 --> 00:30:27.895
“Mother, this miracle happened,
that miracle happened.”

00:30:28.096 --> 00:30:37.135
Is nothing, is your own wisdom, your own
Spirit is working it out.

00:30:37.336 --> 00:30:39.830
You don’t have to do anything.

00:30:40.031 --> 00:30:43.002
Only thing you have to remember that you
are a Sahaja Yogini

00:30:43.203 --> 00:30:47.534
and your character should be that
of a Sahaja Yogini,

00:30:47.735 --> 00:30:52.190
that your ideas should be that
of a Sahaja Yogini.

00:30:57.865 --> 00:31:05.678
PART 8 “THE KEYS ARE IN THE HANDS
OF THE WOMEN OF TODAY”

00:31:08.245 --> 00:31:12.995
And I have to specially make a very
important request to the women

00:31:13.196 --> 00:31:16.752
that in these modern times, they are
the ones who are going to save the world,

00:31:16.953 --> 00:31:20.939
not the men, they have done their job
before.

00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:25.104
Now it is for you to save, with your
understanding, with your compassion,

00:31:25.305 --> 00:31:29.533
with your sacrifices, with your wisdom
and the innate love,

00:31:29.734 --> 00:31:36.521
not only your children, your husband,
your family, but the whole world.

00:31:38.015 --> 00:31:44.838
Is a very good opportunity for all of you
to do your bit.

00:31:46.719 --> 00:31:52.955
It has been a tremendous experience
with some of the very great

00:31:53.156 --> 00:31:57.103
Sahaja Yoginis we have.

00:31:57.533 --> 00:32:05.553
Some of them have achieved, really, as you
can say, the constant state of bliss.

00:32:06.948 --> 00:32:13.502
Really. Some of them have. In the constant
state of bliss.

00:32:13.703 --> 00:32:19.046
Even if they are coming, immediately I can
feel they are coming.

00:32:19.254 --> 00:32:25.202
The whole atmosphere waits for them.
The whole cosmos,

00:32:25.403 --> 00:32:35.390
just in complete respectful attendance,
is waiting for their arrival.

00:32:35.591 --> 00:32:39.210
There are women of that quality.

00:32:39.411 --> 00:32:45.077
And we have to take them as ideals, and
not the stupid, useless, vain women.

00:32:45.286 --> 00:32:49.845
We have to take them as something great.

00:32:50.046 --> 00:32:54.937
This is what I have to tell you that
the potential within you is very great.

00:32:55.138 --> 00:32:58.553
Sahaja Yoga should not be limited to you
or to your children.

00:32:59.731 --> 00:33:05.124
But the ladies of Sahaja Yoga have
to work it out.

00:33:05.325 --> 00:33:09.726
They have to see that they give that power
to their men.

00:33:09.927 --> 00:33:13.952
If I find any husband weak, I know
it’s the wife

00:33:14.153 --> 00:33:18.795
who is a nagger or who is a dominating
person,

00:33:18.996 --> 00:33:22.343
or who thinks no end of herself.

00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:33.553
And if I see a man so powerful, I know
there’s a woman behind him.

00:33:34.617 --> 00:33:41.315
It’s just like electricity and the light
and the lamp.

00:33:44.171 --> 00:33:50.490
If the electricity is flowing all right,
the lamp is burning. Absolutely that.

00:33:51.586 --> 00:33:58.447
But if you are identified with these stupid
vain women, then you are lost.

00:33:58.648 --> 00:34:01.221
You’ll be finished.

00:34:02.218 --> 00:34:07.106
If you know what I am, if you know what
I am saying,

00:34:07.307 --> 00:34:12.209
and if you try to follow what you have
to do,

00:34:12.410 --> 00:34:19.872
then you will immediately see that

00:34:20.073 --> 00:34:25.962
Mother is trying to strengthen our roots.

00:34:27.990 --> 00:34:31.938
Because you are the roots of the trees,

00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:36.834
you have to give all the nourishment.

00:34:37.498 --> 00:34:41.482
You have to be motherly, sisterly

00:34:42.735 --> 00:34:46.451
towards all the other Sahaja Yogis.

00:34:48.146 --> 00:34:51.462
Not to quarrel, to fight, to say hard
things.

00:34:51.663 --> 00:34:57.243
That’s not the job of a woman.
Not to argue

00:34:59.226 --> 00:35:07.482
but be quiet and watch out.

00:35:08.327 --> 00:35:11.327
Even if they are catching on certain
chakras,

00:35:11.528 --> 00:35:14.967
you can cleanse them very well as wives.

00:35:15.168 --> 00:35:19.312
You can work it out secretly. You can
do it.

00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:24.046
Because the problem, though it looks
so dangerous,

00:35:24.247 --> 00:35:27.890
and so destructive and shocking,

00:35:29.692 --> 00:35:34.365
the keys are in the hands of the women
of today.

00:35:35.926 --> 00:35:39.484
They can just solve the problem like that,

00:35:39.685 --> 00:35:43.452
if they decide and understand their glory
and their value,

00:35:43.653 --> 00:35:51.671
and do not make themselves cheap,
hankering after cheap popularity.

00:35:57.083 --> 00:36:03.155
If I have been able to nail down

00:36:03.926 --> 00:36:13.991
this great problem to a very precise source
of it,

00:36:14.192 --> 00:36:17.395
and if you can manage the source,

00:36:17.596 --> 00:36:20.028
I’m sure we can manage Sahaja Yoga.

00:36:20.229 --> 00:36:27.628
We can manage the whole world and
the humanity at large is going to be

00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:33.598
absolutely saved as that is your desire.

00:36:33.799 --> 00:36:36.660
May God bless you!
