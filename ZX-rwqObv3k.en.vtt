Shri Krishna Puja
Cabella Ligure, Italy

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:12.940
20th August, 2000

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:18.920
Today we are here to worship Shri Krishna
within us.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:37.610
As you know, that you all have been seeking
before coming to Sahaja Yoga.

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:53.710
You went to different places, read lots of
books, and also some of you were lost.

00:00:53.710 --> 00:01:01.160
And in that seeking, perhaps you did not know
what you were seeking.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:09.560
What you were seeking was to know yourself.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.509
In all religions it is said “Know thyself.”

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:17.190
It’s a common thing all of them have said.

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:24.321
This is one point which is absolutely there
in every religion, “Know thyself” – because

00:01:24.321 --> 00:01:30.130
without knowing yourself you will not know
God.

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.710
You will not know spirituality.

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:40.361
So the first step was to know yourself, and
that one people did all kinds of tricks with

00:01:40.361 --> 00:01:50.510
you, they taught you in a different ways and
tried to actually loot you and cheat you.

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.450
All those things have happened, is finished.

00:01:53.450 --> 00:02:01.330
So then you come to Sahaja Yoga and you get
your Self-realization.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:15.560
Well, what is the purpose of Self-realization
is to know God, or the Goddess; that is the

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:21.599
purpose of Self-realization.

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:29.769
But after getting Self-realization, what should
happen to you?

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:37.680
Many of you have lost interest in nonsensical
things like drugs and all those things; you

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:46.219
have lost interest in reading also useless
books; you have lost interest in other habits

00:02:46.219 --> 00:02:48.689
like drinking and all that.

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:53.349
But that’s not enough, that’s not enough.

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:57.859
That would happen in anyway.

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:04.659
What has to happen by knowing God, is that
why does God wants you to know Him?

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:09.809
Because He wants to see His reflection in
you.

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:16.010
He wants to see His reflection, that’s why
He has created you, and He wants to see His

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:17.290
reflection in you.

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.079
Same with the Goddess.

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:30.279
She has given you Self-realization because
She wants to see Her reflection in you.

00:03:30.279 --> 00:03:48.129
So you have to prepare yourself for that reflection,
which is so much purer, beautiful, loving,

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:57.269
compassionate and above all, full of wisdom.

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:05.079
So this is the point one has to reach, where
you understand you have to have wisdom.

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:11.040
If you are lacking in wisdom then you are
not a self-realized person.

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:20.350
At the level of Shri Krishna, you see, He
wants you to become one part and parcel of

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:27.790
the Virata – or the Viratangana, also wants
the same thing, that you should become part

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:32.540
and parcel of the Virata.

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:38.710
Not because you are realized souls now, so
you go about thinking you are perfectly all

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:43.160
right, you don’t have to do anything about
it.

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:53.980
What do you do beyond this is the point, that
after Self-realization you have to see the

00:04:53.980 --> 00:05:07.121
reflection that should be within you from
the lives of these people like Shri Krishna.

00:05:07.121 --> 00:05:18.930
Shri Krishna was first born in a very difficult
situation, as you know, and He was carried

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:25.260
from there to Gokul, where He was brought
up by Yeshoda.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:33.910
Now there He started His playfulness.

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:41.490
So you have to be playful in life, you have
to create fun and joy.

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:50.570
He didn’t say that you sit down like a old
sage somewhere in the Himalayas, but you mix

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:57.960
up with children, you talk to them, you play
with them, have fun.

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:05.250
At the same time He was destroying negative
forces which acted upon Him.

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:10.710
In His playfulness only He has done it, as
a child only He has done it.

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:17.800
How matured He was as a child you can see,
that He killed the Putana, and there are two

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.900
horrible rakshasas also, He killed them.

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:32.060
At the same time He was playing with the gopis
and teasing them, troubling them, making fun

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:34.610
of them.

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:35.890
Why?

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:46.860
Because He wanted them to be playful; and
all kinds of celebrations He arranged.

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:56.350
He had once a big rain came, and He lifted
the complete mountain on His fingertips.

00:06:56.350 --> 00:07:02.520
That time these people should have understood,
it’s not possible, it’s a miracle.

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:12.660
But He was just standing there with the one
finger at the mountain in a very simple, unassuming

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:20.920
manner; He was doing all that to protect all
the boys who were playing with Him.

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:30.670
Then He went and killed Kaaliya, the one who
was a big snake in the water.

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:38.680
In the water this horrible fellow was creating
venom, and by which many people were killed.

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:52.270
It took Him no time and He jumped inside that
horrible water of Yamuna, from where He rescued

00:07:52.270 --> 00:08:02.050
in a way all the people by killing or hitting,
or you can say that by winning over this Kaaliya.

00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:11.320
But the wives of the big serpent, they asked
Him that “Please forgive him,” and He

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:12.740
forgave.

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:21.150
All these things show a child of six, seven
years doing all these great things without

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:28.030
feeling what He was doing, we can say that
without even thinking about it.

00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:34.870
But He achieved it, because He was aware that
He was Shri Krishna.

00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:40.900
So first thing, you have to be aware that
you are self-realized people.

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:50.639
You are not ordinary people to behave in an
ordinary way, you are special people made

00:08:50.639 --> 00:08:57.620
specially to reflect the qualities of God
Almighty.

00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:03.569
It’s not expected that you go and kill Kaaliya.

00:09:03.569 --> 00:09:11.270
But the situation is such today that you are
all the time protected.

00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:14.379
You are all the time protected.

00:09:14.379 --> 00:09:23.250
No one can harm you, no one can kill you,
and you can be looked after because you are

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:30.199
Sahaja yogis.

00:09:30.199 --> 00:09:36.350
Now what should be the attitude of a Sahaja
yogi towards taking decisions, one should

00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:39.420
understand.

00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:48.029
It should be a spontaneous decision.

00:09:48.029 --> 00:09:53.740
You don’t have to tally it with this, go
there and find out – immediately, spontaneous,

00:09:53.740 --> 00:10:01.110
like Shri Krishna who jumped inside the river.

00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:07.380
So in the same way you should have a very
spontaneous decision for anything.

00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:09.579
Now you want to buy, say, a carpet.

00:10:09.579 --> 00:10:10.579
All right.

00:10:10.579 --> 00:10:16.839
You go in the shop and immediately you should
know which is the one.

00:10:16.839 --> 00:10:24.079
In every walk of life you should have a very
spontaneous decision, instant decision.

00:10:24.079 --> 00:10:29.540
But what I find, the style is very different.

00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:37.579
They’ll go from shop to shop, then make
a list of it, then make all the measurements,

00:10:37.579 --> 00:10:42.959
then go home and say that “We’ll decide
it tomorrow.”

00:10:42.959 --> 00:10:47.860
That’s not the way a Sahaja yogi behaves.

00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:55.270
Sahaja yogi has to decide everything absolutely
spontaneously, at that moment.

00:10:55.270 --> 00:11:05.410
You should be like this: now somebody is getting
drowned, so the first impulse should be that

00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:08.360
you have to save.

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:10.519
And how do you save?

00:11:10.519 --> 00:11:19.180
You jump in the water – because you are
protected, nothing can happen to you, so just

00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:22.089
jump in the water and you’ll save the person.

00:11:22.089 --> 00:11:29.579
Minimum of minimum this should be your attitude,
this should be your temperament, that you

00:11:29.579 --> 00:11:33.740
take a very spontaneous decision.

00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:44.769
All this thinking and all kinds of decision-making,
and having a big conference for decisions

00:11:44.769 --> 00:11:48.949
and all that – not needed.

00:11:48.949 --> 00:11:58.079
In day-to-day life also you have to be like
that.

00:11:58.079 --> 00:12:06.399
Also in every political life, economic life
or any other life you have to lead, you have

00:12:06.399 --> 00:12:11.800
to be very spontaneous.

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:16.220
How do you become spontaneous?

00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:17.220
What quality you have got?

00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:25.069
What is the weapon you have got, to know what
decision to take?

00:12:25.069 --> 00:12:28.179
Do you know?

00:12:28.179 --> 00:12:36.110
You have got vibrations, you have the feel
of the vibrations, and you know what vibrations

00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:38.050
are.

00:12:38.050 --> 00:12:43.569
You know what vibrations tell you, and convey
and communicate to you.

00:12:43.569 --> 00:12:46.009
They speak to you.

00:12:46.009 --> 00:12:55.139
So through your vibrations you should know
in a second what should you do.

00:12:55.139 --> 00:13:00.980
For example now, somebody told Me that “Mother,
when I came to Cabella I felt tremendous vibrations.”

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:02.970
It’s a fact.

00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:08.050
But how many of you feel that way?

00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:12.990
Because your sensitivity is not yet developed.

00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:17.579
You have to be sensitive about your vibrations.

00:13:17.579 --> 00:13:25.129
You should know looking at anyone, sitting
next to anyone, even shaking hands with anyone,

00:13:25.129 --> 00:13:32.930
you should know what sort of vibrations that
person has.

00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:39.040
This kind of sensitivity if you develop, then
you will definitely take a very spontaneous

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:40.040
decision.

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:44.529
You know I am very good at it.

00:13:44.529 --> 00:13:52.279
I bought this Cabella in five minutes, really
five minutes.

00:13:52.279 --> 00:13:57.889
When I came here they said, “You can’t
go up, because You have big car.”

00:13:57.889 --> 00:14:01.680
So the Mayor said, “All right, come along,
I’ll take You in my car.”

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:06.610
So I went with him on the car, on that car,
and I saw it.

00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:09.059
It was all dilapidated, no doubt.

00:14:09.059 --> 00:14:19.389
It was all absolutely in a shambles, all right,
and looked like a ghostly place, no doubt.

00:14:19.389 --> 00:14:24.550
And everybody who was with Me, they said,
“Ah, what a place, Mother!

00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:27.130
You can’t buy that.”

00:14:27.130 --> 00:14:29.989
So I told the Mayor, “I am buying it.”

00:14:29.989 --> 00:14:31.040
“When?”

00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:32.089
“Today.

00:14:32.089 --> 00:14:33.139
Now!”

00:14:33.139 --> 00:14:34.139
He was amazed.

00:14:34.139 --> 00:14:37.769
I said, “You tell Me, how do I buy?”

00:14:37.769 --> 00:14:39.569
He said, “Very easy.

00:14:39.569 --> 00:14:47.489
In this Italy You have to buy like this, that
You pay one-third of the price, all right?

00:14:47.489 --> 00:14:49.779
And then You can occupy.

00:14:49.779 --> 00:14:55.630
If You find something wrong with the place
You can give up, but then You’ll not get

00:14:55.630 --> 00:14:56.630
Your money.

00:14:56.630 --> 00:15:00.839
But if the other fellow who is selling You
says no, then he has to pay double.”

00:15:00.839 --> 00:15:02.989
I said, “Very good bargain.

00:15:02.989 --> 00:15:03.989
I am buying.

00:15:03.989 --> 00:15:05.329
I have told you I am buying.

00:15:05.329 --> 00:15:07.410
I’ll buy.”

00:15:07.410 --> 00:15:11.689
And everybody was surprised what Mother was
doing.

00:15:11.689 --> 00:15:16.310
So what decided was the vibrations.

00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:18.600
Vibrations of the place just decided.

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:19.889
I said, “Buy it.”

00:15:19.889 --> 00:15:25.959
That way they took Me to seven, I think, castles;
I said no.

00:15:25.959 --> 00:15:31.510
Outside only I could say no, and they were
surprised I didn’t even go inside.

00:15:31.510 --> 00:15:34.439
I said, “Ask them what was here.”

00:15:34.439 --> 00:15:36.709
They said, “Nunnery.”

00:15:36.709 --> 00:15:38.980
I said, “See?”

00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:43.249
Now you should develop that kind of a spontaneous
decision.

00:15:43.249 --> 00:15:55.730
Then you will be amazed how in such a short
time you can really achieve such great things.

00:15:55.730 --> 00:16:05.600
But that doesn’t mean that you all should
do that way; first you should have that sensitivity

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:07.600
of vibrations.

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:14.000
If you have that sensitivity of vibrations,
then I would say you are now matured in Sahaja

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.000
Yoga.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.249
So the maturity has to be brought in.

00:16:18.249 --> 00:16:24.310
You cannot just say, “Now it’s all right,
I have got Self-realization, I can do this.”

00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:29.410
First you tally your sense of sensitivity.

00:16:29.410 --> 00:16:34.549
So now, how do you know?

00:16:34.549 --> 00:16:43.319
For example, you take a spontaneous decision,
you find that you have got nothing, it’s

00:16:43.319 --> 00:16:46.279
all nonsense – possible.

00:16:46.279 --> 00:16:53.999
But you can see for yourself that your decisions,
if they are spontaneous: if they fail, if

00:16:53.999 --> 00:17:05.350
they are wrong, if there are some mistakes
or that will make you suffer, whether economically,

00:17:05.350 --> 00:17:14.960
politically, in every way, then your whole
value system will be judged very well how

00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:27.170
far you have gone into Sahaja Yoga, how far
you have achieved your Self-realization, and

00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:33.360
where are you.

00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:36.080
This is what is the way to test yourself.

00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:44.930
You should not be afraid of failures, and
not get enamored by success, because you are

00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:46.460
self-realized souls.

00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:53.860
Of course, if you are sensitive, immediately
you will know what is it.

00:17:53.860 --> 00:18:00.610
Now of course, I wouldn’t say that you could
have the same as I have, but you should try

00:18:00.610 --> 00:18:01.610
it.

00:18:01.610 --> 00:18:09.450
Now, I have seen some people will praise some
man, “Oh Mother, he’s so good.

00:18:09.450 --> 00:18:11.100
You must meet him.

00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:18.700
He’s such a nice person and he’s of such
a help, and this will happen and that will

00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:19.700
happen.”

00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:23.980
I said, “All right, you show Me a photograph.”

00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:27.750
I said, “I am sorry, I don’t want to meet
him.”

00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:30.570
They can’t understand.

00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:34.270
“Such a great man, he’ll be a minister
tomorrow.”

00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:39.320
“I don’t want to meet him.”

00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:45.630
And you find immediately, just next day, a
big report about him in the newspaper that

00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:50.660
he’s a very bad man.

00:18:50.660 --> 00:19:00.600
So you must tally your experience and your
understanding of what you have decided spontaneously.

00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:05.840
But still I would say, keep to spontaneous
decisions.

00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:13.400
Don’t think about it how it should work
out, what should we do.

00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:27.420
It has a very far-fetched influence on your
mind also that you see, that you know what

00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:30.130
is right and what is wrong.

00:19:30.130 --> 00:19:33.770
I don’t know how many of you have seen the
house I have built.

00:19:33.770 --> 00:19:42.450
The another side of Shri Krishna was that
He was extremely creative.

00:19:42.450 --> 00:19:49.960
In His childhood He did all these things,
these pranks, and when He became a grown-up

00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:55.580
person He became the king of Dwarika, of that
area.

00:19:55.580 --> 00:20:00.880
And He used to dress up like a king only – after
all, He was a king.

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:11.360
When He was a child He used to wear a small
little piece of a feather from the peacock,

00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:17.600
but when He became the king He was wearing
all the things, and He used to sit on the

00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:21.520
throne and talk to people in that manner.

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:29.240
All that greatness was there, and He was extremely
creative.

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:39.260
He built a beautiful, very, very beautiful
castle or you can say, palace in Dwarika,

00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:43.300
out of gold – can you believe it?

00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:45.920
Shri Krishna did it.

00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:49.010
And it was all then covered with water.

00:20:49.010 --> 00:20:55.310
Now the intellectuals in India, all trained
by Western people I think, said that it’s

00:20:55.310 --> 00:21:02.580
not possible, there’s nothing in the water
and He never built His palace there; it’s

00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:10.160
all a story just, just like a myth.

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:14.370
But some people believed in it, and they dug
up.

00:21:14.370 --> 00:21:19.210
They went down and they found there was a
very big palace.

00:21:19.210 --> 00:21:23.350
There was gold little bit left, but not all
of it was there.

00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:30.790
And they were amazed, such a huge, big palace
He had made.

00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:36.280
Under the water it had gone, but it was there.

00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:44.180
Like this, all these incarnations who came
were extremely creative.

00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:48.900
If you are not creative, what’s the use
of Self-realization?

00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:58.080
Now, what is the greatest creative thing you
can do very easily is to make others Sahaja

00:21:58.080 --> 00:21:59.890
yogis.

00:21:59.890 --> 00:22:12.080
That is the easiest and most joy-giving thing,
is to make others Sahaja yogis and give them

00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:20.770
the blessings of the Divine, which they have
been seeking for ages.

00:22:20.770 --> 00:22:28.110
By giving them, you don’t know what a solace,
what a blessing you give.

00:22:28.110 --> 00:22:35.681
So now when you have got your Self-realization
– you got it very easily, I must say; they

00:22:35.681 --> 00:22:45.950
all say that it is a instant nirvana, Sahaja
Yoga is instant nirvana, it’s true – but

00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:53.410
whatever you get so easily and instantly,
you don’t understand the value of that.

00:22:53.410 --> 00:22:59.120
They always say for India that they got their
freedom so easily; they didn’t get it that

00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:00.620
easily, that’s why they do not value it.

00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:13.430
But it is true, if you get anything free firstly
and without any special effort, then you don’t

00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:15.490
value it, you don’t understand.

00:23:15.490 --> 00:23:17.010
You think it’s a matter of right.

00:23:17.010 --> 00:23:21.560
But do you know how much people have suffered
for getting Self-realization?

00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:29.520
They used to go on the Himalayas, stand on
one leg, sometimes on their heads for months

00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:35.010
together, and they didn’t get realization.

00:23:35.010 --> 00:23:44.600
I have heard of some people who lived in a
room for twenty-eight years to get Self-realization.

00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:48.930
And why they lived like that?

00:23:48.930 --> 00:23:55.640
Because they thought by keeping away from
other people, other bad atmosphere, everything,

00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:57.360
they might get realization.

00:23:57.360 --> 00:24:01.680
They never got it.

00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:10.730
So one must understand, though you have got
it very easily, it’s something so precious,

00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:12.770
so great.

00:24:12.770 --> 00:24:18.140
It’s not very easy to get Self-realization.

00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:28.270
You read about the people who are self-realized.

00:24:28.270 --> 00:24:33.150
Perhaps they did not even know how they got
it, they did not know even about the kundalini,

00:24:33.150 --> 00:24:39.610
but they got it, through their guru maybe,
maybe their efforts.

00:24:39.610 --> 00:24:47.990
Buddha, how much He had to suffer till He
gets His realization – think of Him, how

00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:50.590
He got His realization.

00:24:50.590 --> 00:25:00.660
I mean, you shudder to see of His life: ultimately
dies of hunger and poverty.

00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:03.810
But nothing happened to you.

00:25:03.810 --> 00:25:11.210
You have got it without any difficulties,
in a very sweet manner, all of you.

00:25:11.210 --> 00:25:15.290
Nothing – you don’t have to pay, you don’t
have to do anything about it.

00:25:15.290 --> 00:25:22.920
But that doesn’t mean you should not value
it.

00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:35.450
Like a seed which is put in the Mother Earth
spontaneously sprouts and gives life to the

00:25:35.450 --> 00:25:44.970
primule which grows, can grow into a shrub
and then into a tree.

00:25:44.970 --> 00:25:54.280
But you have to put water in, and you have
to have the care of a gardener or someone.

00:25:54.280 --> 00:26:01.260
In your case, you are the one who has to do
all that.

00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:11.350
First of all you have to put the nourishment
of compassion and love.

00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:14.470
Have you got that compassion and love?

00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:18.590
Do you love people?

00:26:18.590 --> 00:26:22.690
Like somebody told Me today – I was shocked
– “I don’t like children.”

00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:24.610
I said, “You don’t like children?”

00:26:24.610 --> 00:26:26.760
“No, I like others’ children, not mine.”

00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:35.390
Just imagine, how can you be doing that?

00:26:35.390 --> 00:26:40.480
How can you say such a thing, you don’t
like your own children, anything?

00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:48.340
First of all, for all of you I would say that
you should never say “I like” and “I

00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:49.480
don’t like.”

00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:51.180
These are anti-mantras.

00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:54.590
“I like this” – it’s very common.

00:26:54.590 --> 00:26:56.290
Who are you?

00:26:56.290 --> 00:26:58.570
“I don’t like this carpet.

00:26:58.570 --> 00:27:00.540
I don’t like that silver thing.”

00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:03.650
Who are you?

00:27:03.650 --> 00:27:06.640
Can you make one like that?

00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:15.090
To take a decision of that kind is also shows
they think it’s very spontaneous – it’s

00:27:15.090 --> 00:27:16.090
not.

00:27:16.090 --> 00:27:20.832
It has come from your conditioning, that you
think you have a right to say “I don’t

00:27:20.832 --> 00:27:22.900
like, I don’t want.”

00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:26.900
But who are you?

00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:33.930
If you are the spirit you’ll never use these
words, because it might hurt somebody.

00:27:33.930 --> 00:27:42.640
You’ll never say something that will hurt
others, you’ll never do anything that will

00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:50.810
be dangerous for others; but always you’ll
say something that would be extremely loving

00:27:50.810 --> 00:27:53.010
and compassionate, and peace-giving.

00:27:53.010 --> 00:28:00.610
You will emit joy for others.

00:28:00.610 --> 00:28:09.030
There is the power of spirit, that it gives
joy to others.

00:28:09.030 --> 00:28:14.710
If you are a glum person, grumpy person, then
you are not self-realized.

00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:23.360
You should be able to give joy and love and
compassion, and it should happen absolutely

00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:29.550
spontaneously.

00:28:29.550 --> 00:28:40.960
There’s a story about a saint in India,
in Maharashtra.

00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:50.290
So they all used to take water in a container
called as kanwar, and would take it all the

00:28:50.290 --> 00:28:55.620
way to Gujarat, to a temple of Shri Krishna.

00:28:55.620 --> 00:29:02.960
That was regarded as a great, you can say,
surrendering to Shri Krishna.

00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:08.570
So that saint also carried water in that container,
this kanwar.

00:29:08.570 --> 00:29:19.650
All the way he carried it from his village
in Maharashtra, and when he reached the temple,

00:29:19.650 --> 00:29:33.500
at the foot of that temple he saw a donkey
very thirsty, dying out of thirst.

00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:40.270
So he gave that water to that donkey.

00:29:40.270 --> 00:29:44.460
Everybody said, “Imagine, you brought this
water for miles together, for days together

00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:52.730
to be put on the deity here, and now you have
given it to this donkey.”

00:29:52.730 --> 00:30:01.870
He said, “You don’t know, God has come
all the way down here to take the water.”

00:30:01.870 --> 00:30:07.350
See the attitude that he took.

00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:16.620
So for a self-realized person the compassion
should be like that, of very generous nature.

00:30:16.620 --> 00:30:23.920
If you are not generous, if you are miserly,
always worried about your money and saving

00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:32.700
of it, then firstly you are not a matured
Sahaja yogi – you are not.

00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:39.120
Apart from that, this kind of money will never
give you any happiness.

00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:42.760
Miserliness is against spirit.

00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:48.760
Spirit is extremely generous, extremely generous.

00:30:48.760 --> 00:31:02.910
It never strives to save something, or cheat
people or steal something – is out of question;

00:31:02.910 --> 00:31:08.950
because there is no greed left in it, there
is no greed at all.

00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:18.630
And that is why such a person who is a realized
soul cannot be greedy, has to be extremely

00:31:18.630 --> 00:31:19.780
generous.

00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:28.860
I have seen many people like that who have
been extremely generous, and who have been

00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:33.520
very understanding about the problems of others.

00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:39.710
While a Sahaja yogi will have his own problems,
he is not a Sahaja yogi at all.

00:31:39.710 --> 00:31:48.380
He is there to solve the problems of others,
and not to solve his own problems and go about

00:31:48.380 --> 00:31:50.660
talking about it, “This is the problem I
have.”

00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:54.150
Now this is a new word that has developed
in modern times.

00:31:54.150 --> 00:31:59.720
They never used to use the word “problem”
before, I tell you; only for geometry we used

00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:01.420
this word “problem.”

00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:04.510
But now it has started with a … “There’s
no problem.”

00:32:04.510 --> 00:32:11.500
They are all in a problem, actually they are
problems, I think.

00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:18.330
So what you have to do is to understand that
you should not give your problems to others.

00:32:18.330 --> 00:32:25.250
You should not ask for anything, “Please
do this for me, please do that for me.”

00:32:25.250 --> 00:32:37.770
It’s very surprising that people try to
sort of take advantage of others.

00:32:37.770 --> 00:32:42.870
Now some people like to visit some countries,
so they will ask you, “Please call me.

00:32:42.870 --> 00:32:47.560
I would love to come to your country,” and
a generous Sahaja yogi will say, “All right,

00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:49.350
come along.”

00:32:49.350 --> 00:32:55.290
Now, who is failing here is the person who
asked.

00:32:55.290 --> 00:33:03.280
You shouldn’t ask for anything whatsoever,
because you are complete.

00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:05.809
Not that only you are satisfied, but are complete.

00:33:05.809 --> 00:33:12.220
What can anybody give you?

00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:16.559
All desires just disappear when you are in
complete shape.

00:33:16.559 --> 00:33:20.150
Like today I was coming, I saw lots of stars
had come out.

00:33:20.150 --> 00:33:24.970
I said, “As soon as the moon will come,
they’ll all disappear.”

00:33:24.970 --> 00:33:38.690
In the same way, when you are complete, you
do not expect anybody to do anything for you.

00:33:38.690 --> 00:33:44.380
On the contrary, you want to find out what
you can do for others.

00:33:44.380 --> 00:33:49.700
You become the others, in a way that whatever
is the problem of others you take upon your

00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:53.020
head.

00:33:53.020 --> 00:33:56.200
You jump into it.

00:33:56.200 --> 00:34:04.370
It’s a very, very interesting growth that
should come in you.

00:34:04.370 --> 00:34:13.250
It should happen to all of you, because you
have got your Self-realization.

00:34:13.250 --> 00:34:20.780
You develop a kind of a personality which
only lives for others, not for oneself.

00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:25.680
You will be amazed: you can live anywhere,
you can sleep anywhere.

00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:29.840
You can have food, you need not have food,
whatever type of food you get it’s all right,

00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:36.450
because you are so satisfied.

00:34:36.450 --> 00:34:44.460
On the contrary, you’d like to cook for
others, give them food, do whatever you like

00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:47.380
possible, you try to do.

00:34:47.380 --> 00:34:55.780
As long as you can work it out, you do it.

00:34:55.780 --> 00:35:01.630
But there are people who have only their own
problems.

00:35:01.630 --> 00:35:03.710
They are not Sahaja yogis.

00:35:03.710 --> 00:35:11.640
How can the spirit have problems?

00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:15.840
How can that happen?

00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:25.190
So just understand that you are now the spirit,
and beyond everything.

00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:31.530
So your creativity also goes to other dimensions.

00:35:31.530 --> 00:35:36.190
Of course you start giving realization to
people.

00:35:36.190 --> 00:35:38.710
You create art.

00:35:38.710 --> 00:35:45.920
You know Baba Mama, he was very bad at literature
and he was – well, he didn’t know any

00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:46.920
language.

00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:51.780
He was very good for mathematics, because
My mother was a mathematician, but language

00:35:51.780 --> 00:35:53.270
he did not know.

00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:55.921
I used to write his essays, he was so bad!

00:35:55.921 --> 00:36:01.530
But after realization he wrote such beautiful
poems.

00:36:01.530 --> 00:36:03.310
Unbelievable!

00:36:03.310 --> 00:36:08.530
Nobody can believe this Baba could do that,
because he didn’t know any language well.

00:36:08.530 --> 00:36:13.040
I used to write his essays, as I told you.

00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:22.480
So, amazingly, from where he started writing
Urdu poetry, Marathi poetry, Hindi poetry?

00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:27.890
And one of My brothers asked him, “How do
you get this Urdu poetry?”

00:36:27.890 --> 00:36:31.609
He said, “Shri Mataji has, She tells me.”

00:36:31.609 --> 00:36:35.530
Everything he used to say, “Mataji tells
me.”

00:36:35.530 --> 00:36:47.430
So the creativity within you is just flowers,
and you are amazed at yourself how this creativity

00:36:47.430 --> 00:36:48.720
has come in.

00:36:48.720 --> 00:37:00.270
Now imagine, for a person who is a mathematician
becoming suddenly a poet – I mean, it’s

00:37:00.270 --> 00:37:02.820
impossible situation.

00:37:02.820 --> 00:37:04.540
And you have these capacities.

00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:13.760
You have all these capacities that you can
become very creative, and you have to be creative

00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:15.970
in every way.

00:37:15.970 --> 00:37:24.310
I am very creative, I must say, I am all the
time working out something which comes out

00:37:24.310 --> 00:37:26.350
very well.

00:37:26.350 --> 00:37:33.960
And also I don’t have that interest as normally
people have, that it should be praised by

00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:42.180
everyone or it should be, sort of, very much
in the newspapers and everything.

00:37:42.180 --> 00:37:44.830
No, no interest.

00:37:44.830 --> 00:37:52.180
You create for creation, for the sake of creation
you create, and you just enjoy that creation.

00:37:52.180 --> 00:38:03.840
And you become very adaptable, or you become
so congenial with all the things people say,

00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:09.180
talk – all right, let them do it.

00:38:09.180 --> 00:38:18.650
They will be offensive, or they could be also
praising you … you don’t know that they

00:38:18.650 --> 00:38:20.480
are praising you.

00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:23.730
Even sometimes when you “Shri Mataji ki
Jai!”

00:38:23.730 --> 00:38:32.850
– I also say, and then I forget they are
talking about Me.

00:38:32.850 --> 00:38:40.410
Somehow you are above all that, and you are
there, and you just don’t understand why

00:38:40.410 --> 00:38:47.310
human beings behave like that, why their behavior
is so funny.

00:38:47.310 --> 00:38:54.290
Even when they come to Sahaja Yoga I see they
have a great desire to be leaders, or they

00:38:54.290 --> 00:39:06.170
have a great desire to be a great organizer
of Sahaja Yoga, to be very well-known in Sahaja

00:39:06.170 --> 00:39:07.170
Yoga.

00:39:07.170 --> 00:39:17.020
They want to have an international fame as
a great Sahaja yogi.

00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:22.490
But they do not think that “What creativity
I have shown?

00:39:22.490 --> 00:39:26.390
What have I created?”

00:39:26.390 --> 00:39:32.550
Just all these things are so common in human
beings that they always want others to praise

00:39:32.550 --> 00:39:44.330
them, to have a very big sort of a exposure
– of what?

00:39:44.330 --> 00:39:47.710
If you are a spirit, everybody knows.

00:39:47.710 --> 00:39:55.140
What is there to expose, what is there to
show off, what is there to come forward?

00:39:55.140 --> 00:40:03.405
Even if you are at the back there is light,
you know there is light.

00:40:03.405 --> 00:40:11.530
So you have to get out of your darkness, because
you are the light and you spread light; instead

00:40:11.530 --> 00:40:19.269
of if you are in the darkness, what light
can you spread?

00:40:19.269 --> 00:40:23.550
So your spirit cannot have problems.

00:40:23.550 --> 00:40:28.190
It has no fear.

00:40:28.190 --> 00:40:38.070
But above all it has wisdom, tremendous wisdom,
and that wisdom is the one sign of you being

00:40:38.070 --> 00:40:40.660
a very higher personality.

00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:49.570
As I told you, this is evolution, and when
you are transformed you are evolved.

00:40:49.570 --> 00:40:58.330
Of a very different nature you become, and
you are to stand out.

00:40:58.330 --> 00:41:06.450
If Sahaja yogis are like other people, then
what’s the use of taking to Sahaja Yoga?

00:41:06.450 --> 00:41:07.890
What was Christ?

00:41:07.890 --> 00:41:10.850
He was a son of a carpenter.

00:41:10.850 --> 00:41:16.540
He never got education.

00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:19.390
But what did He do?

00:41:19.390 --> 00:41:24.980
He was the Spirit.

00:41:24.980 --> 00:41:37.430
He reflected God within Him, and that’s
why He got Himself crucified also.

00:41:37.430 --> 00:41:45.030
Now in Sahaja Yoga you don’t have to get
crucified, there are all not such testing

00:41:45.030 --> 00:41:52.130
things for you, but your value system is to
be checked.

00:41:52.130 --> 00:41:59.050
You must find out how are you working out,
through introspection.

00:41:59.050 --> 00:42:10.300
You should ask yourself, “So well now, Mr.
Sahaja yogi, how are you?

00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:18.230
Are you indulging into all these things that
these people who are not self-realized are

00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:19.570
doing?”

00:42:19.570 --> 00:42:28.330
Just try to find out, because the growth of
Sahaja Yoga is shown in your behavior, in

00:42:28.330 --> 00:42:35.290
your styles, on your face.

00:42:35.290 --> 00:42:46.120
There is no wrinkles on a person like this,
he has no worry; you don’t worry, then how

00:42:46.120 --> 00:42:48.580
will you get wrinkles?

00:42:48.580 --> 00:42:53.290
Such a person doesn’t get upset with anything.

00:42:53.290 --> 00:42:59.780
I mean, on the contrary he laughs at things.

00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:11.451
Once in a church there was in Switzerland,
one lady came to hit Me with a Bible, and

00:43:11.451 --> 00:43:12.470
I started laughing.

00:43:12.470 --> 00:43:16.490
I said, “What a thing, and I have to be
hit by a Bible!”

00:43:16.490 --> 00:43:17.490
you see.

00:43:17.490 --> 00:43:24.220
And she got such a fright that I was laughing,
and I was saying, “Look at this stupidity

00:43:24.220 --> 00:43:26.700
of this lady, coming to hit Me with a Bible!”

00:43:26.700 --> 00:43:32.780
I mean, I can understand stone or anything
else, but Bible will never hit Me.

00:43:32.780 --> 00:43:49.020
All these things have happened in your presence,
and you know about it.

00:43:49.020 --> 00:43:54.050
There are negative forces.

00:43:54.050 --> 00:43:55.570
They try to harm you.

00:43:55.570 --> 00:44:00.910
They will harm you bodily, they will harm
you mentally, they might harm you emotionally.

00:44:00.910 --> 00:44:09.150
But when you are above this, then no one harms
you.

00:44:09.150 --> 00:44:14.830
At least you never feel the harm, you are
not bothered about the harm.

00:44:14.830 --> 00:44:18.180
But what have you created?

00:44:18.180 --> 00:44:25.150
Today I had some ladies and some men, and
all for divorce.

00:44:25.150 --> 00:44:31.820
After getting married in Sahaja Yoga, they
want to have divorces, can you imagine?

00:44:31.820 --> 00:44:34.730
I was shocked.

00:44:34.730 --> 00:44:38.720
And they had funny ideas that “my husband
is like my brother.”

00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:41.330
I said, “Really?”

00:44:41.330 --> 00:44:46.970
All kinds of stupid ideas coming into their
heads means there’s no light of the spirit

00:44:46.970 --> 00:44:48.230
in them.

00:44:48.230 --> 00:44:56.930
If you have light of the spirit, then your
understanding is very different.

00:44:56.930 --> 00:45:03.310
You don’t worry about yourself, you only
worry about others, and you try to find out

00:45:03.310 --> 00:45:06.990
solutions for them.

00:45:06.990 --> 00:45:10.100
You try to help them.

00:45:10.100 --> 00:45:17.250
It is very easy for you.

00:45:17.250 --> 00:45:20.260
What is so easy for the light to burn?

00:45:20.260 --> 00:45:24.730
Once it is enlightened, it is burning.

00:45:24.730 --> 00:45:26.990
It’s difficult for it to go out of light.

00:45:26.990 --> 00:45:33.980
But for human beings, I can’t understand,
even after realization, after growing for

00:45:33.980 --> 00:45:41.700
years together they are still so stupid that
they don’t realize the value of their Self-realization.

00:45:41.700 --> 00:45:54.550
It is something, the spirit, you cannot kill
it.

00:45:54.550 --> 00:45:56.090
It cannot blow off.

00:45:56.090 --> 00:46:02.250
This light will go off, but the light of the
spirit won’t go off.

00:46:02.250 --> 00:46:11.810
But what is the oil that keeps it there is
your compassion, is love, care of others.

00:46:11.810 --> 00:46:17.250
I know there are people who are very, say,
dominating, may be troublesome, what else

00:46:17.250 --> 00:46:19.160
– but care for them.

00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:25.060
Know that they are not like you, they are
not complete, they have problems; so you care

00:46:25.060 --> 00:46:26.220
for them.

00:46:26.220 --> 00:46:30.450
But instead of that, you start thinking that
“Why should I care for him?

00:46:30.450 --> 00:46:31.450
How does he care for me?”

00:46:31.450 --> 00:46:32.450
or something.

00:46:32.450 --> 00:46:34.410
Then you are finished.

00:46:34.410 --> 00:46:43.760
So this kind of a reflection, or I would say
the reaction, is not that of a spirit.

00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:48.680
A spiritual person’s reactions are very,
very different.

00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:57.369
In the life of Shri Krishna you can see that
He had a friend who was very poor, and he

00:46:57.369 --> 00:47:00.960
wanted to meet Shri Krishna.

00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:07.980
And the wife of the friend gave him some rice
crispies, as you call them, “And that’s,

00:47:07.980 --> 00:47:10.070
take for your friend.

00:47:10.070 --> 00:47:11.780
You must take something for your friend.”

00:47:11.780 --> 00:47:15.510
He was a little shy, you know.

00:47:15.510 --> 00:47:23.340
And when he went to Shri Krishna, Shri Krishna
was in His palace, and the people at the door

00:47:23.340 --> 00:47:25.210
said, “No, you can’t meet Him.”

00:47:25.210 --> 00:47:26.890
He said, “All right.

00:47:26.890 --> 00:47:31.570
You just go and tell Him that Sudama has come.”

00:47:31.570 --> 00:47:38.800
He was sitting on the throne discussing something,
and He said, “Sudama has come!”

00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:52.849
He rushed out and went to the door and hugged
him, hugged him again and again; and He said,

00:47:52.849 --> 00:47:56.880
“Why are you standing here?”

00:47:56.880 --> 00:48:07.610
He took him and put him on the throne that
He was supposed to, and He told His wives,

00:48:07.610 --> 00:48:11.099
“Please come and wash his feet.”

00:48:11.099 --> 00:48:14.200
And then they brought for him clothes and
all that.

00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:24.270
He had a bath; He made him sleep on His bed
– see the love of Shri Krishna.

00:48:24.270 --> 00:48:29.020
He had very dirty feet, all were cracked.

00:48:29.020 --> 00:48:37.060
He tried to put on that some sort of a medicine
by which it would be all right.

00:48:37.060 --> 00:48:42.960
He tried to do whatever was possible to him
to cure those cracks.

00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:51.670
And He asked him to sleep on His bed, and
asked the ladies to fan him so that he doesn’t

00:48:51.670 --> 00:48:54.010
feel hot.

00:48:54.010 --> 00:49:01.960
See the compassion of Shri Krishna, it shows
so beautifully.

00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:05.520
Are we that compassionate?

00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:14.750
There was no need for Him to do that; it was
no drama, nothing – but His heart!

00:49:14.750 --> 00:49:19.240
He took a spontaneous decision.

00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:23.700
When He heard Sudama is there, He just rushed
there.

00:49:23.700 --> 00:49:33.440
He just felt so happy that “My old friend
has come.”

00:49:33.440 --> 00:49:49.520
Then, when He went to Hastinapur, there the
Duryodhan, the Kauravas’ eldest son, he

00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:52.790
asked Him that “Why don’t You come and
stay in my palace?”

00:49:52.790 --> 00:50:02.359
He said, “All right, I can come, but you
see, I will go and have food with Vidur.”

00:50:02.359 --> 00:50:07.030
Vidur was a son of a maid.

00:50:07.030 --> 00:50:13.960
He went and had His food with Vidur.

00:50:13.960 --> 00:50:23.030
Now Vidur being a poor man, I don’t know
what food he must have given Him, while Duryodhan

00:50:23.030 --> 00:50:26.770
would have given Him such sumptuous food.

00:50:26.770 --> 00:50:30.680
So for such people, taste and the level of
food and all doesn’t matter; it’s the

00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:41.750
love, the respect of Vidur, who was a realized
soul – respecting other Sahaja yogis.

00:50:41.750 --> 00:50:53.890
If a Sahaja yogi respects somebody who is
a governor – I can’t understand; the spirit

00:50:53.890 --> 00:50:59.710
is above everything else – and does not
respect a Sahaja yogi, there’s something

00:50:59.710 --> 00:51:02.020
wrong with him.

00:51:02.020 --> 00:51:08.290
He should understand that this spiritual person
is higher than all these people who have these,

00:51:08.290 --> 00:51:16.720
all kinds of these big names behind them.

00:51:16.720 --> 00:51:29.410
And that love is shown in everybody’s life:
all the saints, all the incarnations, everyone

00:51:29.410 --> 00:51:39.609
had that love which was above everything else,
without expecting anything, not doing it just

00:51:39.609 --> 00:51:43.800
to expect something from them.

00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:54.530
It is a kind of a personality which really
reflects God’s love.

00:51:54.530 --> 00:51:56.930
That reflection should come from you.

00:51:56.930 --> 00:52:05.080
You are Sahaja yogis: that doesn’t mean
that you are something higher than others,

00:52:05.080 --> 00:52:08.109
but you are different.

00:52:08.109 --> 00:52:11.140
You are above them.

00:52:11.140 --> 00:52:14.240
You have no superiority, that’s why you
are different.

00:52:14.240 --> 00:52:19.110
You are so humble, that’s why you are different.

00:52:19.110 --> 00:52:24.910
You are so joyous, you are so peaceful, that’s
why you are humble.

00:52:24.910 --> 00:52:34.770
There are so many things I can tell you from
the life of Shri Krishna, showing He was,

00:52:34.770 --> 00:52:38.480
they call Him Yogeshwara.

00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:41.410
He was a Lord of Yoga.

00:52:41.410 --> 00:52:47.330
It is because He was Virat.

00:52:47.330 --> 00:53:00.460
But He showed it, His form, only to Arjuna,
to nobody else, because nobody was like Arjuna.

00:53:00.460 --> 00:53:06.130
Arjuna also got a fright when he saw that.

00:53:06.130 --> 00:53:16.570
So He lived like Shri Krishna, like a cowboy
He was living in Gokul, and He never showed

00:53:16.570 --> 00:53:18.250
off His powers.

00:53:18.250 --> 00:53:27.150
His powers were within Himself, which were
expressing spontaneously.

00:53:27.150 --> 00:53:37.900
This power has wisdom and discretion, complete
discretion.

00:53:37.900 --> 00:53:46.941
If it does not have then this is not divine
power, this is some satanic power: because

00:53:46.941 --> 00:53:55.900
somebody is nice to you if you are nice to
that person, nothing doing.

00:53:55.900 --> 00:54:04.550
Mostly we had in India people who were called
as avadhutas.

00:54:04.550 --> 00:54:12.650
They were the realized souls who had gone
away from the society, from the multitudes,

00:54:12.650 --> 00:54:23.010
and gone and lived in some small little place
or some cave or somewhere, hidden from others;

00:54:23.010 --> 00:54:31.920
because they thought nobody is going to understand
them, so what’s the use of talking to them.

00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:38.470
They were singled out, one person here and
one person there.

00:54:38.470 --> 00:54:39.570
What could they do?

00:54:39.570 --> 00:54:45.500
They were not like you, so many of Sahaja
yogis together.

00:54:45.500 --> 00:54:49.910
You have so many friends and you have so many
others with you.

00:54:49.910 --> 00:54:56.050
They were lonely people, and they hid themselves
from the society.

00:54:56.050 --> 00:55:02.410
They would not meet people, because if they
tried anything they would be crucified.

00:55:02.410 --> 00:55:08.520
But not you people, because you have a society.

00:55:08.520 --> 00:55:21.349
You have a beautiful enlightened society of
very good friends, of very good spiritual

00:55:21.349 --> 00:55:22.510
people.

00:55:22.510 --> 00:55:31.950
With all this if you cannot create, then what
should I say?

00:55:31.950 --> 00:55:44.780
You have to create something: may be art,
may be music, may be poetry, may be literature,

00:55:44.780 --> 00:55:50.210
may be writing – whatever it is, you have
to create.

00:55:50.210 --> 00:55:54.359
And above all, you have to create Sahaja yogis.

00:55:54.359 --> 00:55:58.690
That’s the main creation you have to achieve.

00:55:58.690 --> 00:56:06.850
That’s the main thing you have to have,
is creating Sahaja yogis all over.

00:56:06.850 --> 00:56:13.780
And there I can go to places, can have programs,
do everything.

00:56:13.780 --> 00:56:22.230
But you have to show with your own example
that this is something great, how they have

00:56:22.230 --> 00:56:28.690
achieved this state; we should achieve also
that state.

00:56:28.690 --> 00:56:40.849
So you will be the ones who will really inspire
them, who will really make them follow you

00:56:40.849 --> 00:56:45.500
and take to a life of a Sahaja yogi.

00:56:45.500 --> 00:56:54.530
Actually you are Mahayogis, if you become
complete – and you have to become.

00:56:54.530 --> 00:57:04.050
Nothing is more important than becoming a
Mahayogi, by which your spirit gives joy,

00:57:04.050 --> 00:57:11.930
peace and blessings to everyone.

00:57:11.930 --> 00:57:18.230
May God bless you.
