00:00:08.805 --> 00:00:14.305
Shri Ganesha has four hands

00:00:15.722 --> 00:00:23.221
and the hand that carries the destructive weapon of Parasha

00:00:24.555 --> 00:00:29.972
is the one you have to be careful about.

00:00:35.014 --> 00:00:37.555
That is His job

00:00:40.346 --> 00:00:42.722
and if you neglect Him,

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:47.555
that force will act

00:00:49.007 --> 00:00:52.600
and act so vehemently

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.475
that despite your realization

00:00:55.555 --> 00:01:00.934
you may not be able to save yourself.

00:01:01.014 --> 00:01:04.391
Do not take your realization for granted.

00:01:04.471 --> 00:01:07.308
Unless and until your Ganesha is settled,

00:01:07.388 --> 00:01:11.225
your realization has no meaning at all.

00:01:11.305 --> 00:01:13.346
Watch yourself,

00:01:14.763 --> 00:01:17.889
have you got adulterous eyes?

00:01:21.972 --> 00:01:27.221
Have you got an adulterous mind?

00:01:30.847 --> 00:01:37.722
What is your expectation about Sahaja Yoga?

00:01:38.972 --> 00:01:42.809
So many think that in Sahaja Yoga God blesses you,

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:49.308
then you must get a good amount of health,

00:01:49.388 --> 00:01:51.179
money

00:01:54.638 --> 00:01:56.683
and position,

00:01:56.763 --> 00:01:59.069
power.

00:02:02.388 --> 00:02:09.723
The first thing you must ask for is the pure Ganesha,

00:02:09.803 --> 00:02:14.386
Nirmal Ganesha.

00:02:18.346 --> 00:02:24.517
“Oh, Mother, please give us

00:02:24.597 --> 00:02:31.059
the blessings of establishment of purity

00:02:31.139 --> 00:02:36.513
in our Ganesha principle.”

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.042
In relationships,

00:02:44.198 --> 00:02:47.332
in attitudes,

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:51.960
in behavior,

00:02:56.081 --> 00:03:00.665
try to judge yourself, are you innocent?

00:03:05.097 --> 00:03:13.183
Christ has said anything against Him may be tolerated

00:03:13.263 --> 00:03:19.433
but nothing against the Adi Shakti.

00:03:19.513 --> 00:03:25.725
But I must tell you as your Mother, it’s not true.

00:03:25.805 --> 00:03:30.391
Maybe against Me some things may be tolerated

00:03:30.471 --> 00:03:37.391
but nothing against Christ, the Lord,

00:03:37.471 --> 00:03:42.975
nothing against Lord Ganesha.

00:03:43.055 --> 00:03:49.140
Everything that is done against Him after realization

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.971
will tell upon you

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:02.600
and you’ll be thrown out of the realm of God,

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.100
as absolutely degraded people.

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.517
That is one thing that will not be tolerated,

00:04:11.597 --> 00:04:17.849
will not be forgiven, will never be acceptable.

00:04:17.929 --> 00:04:22.362
To your Mother nothing but purity of heart

00:04:22.442 --> 00:04:31.276
and purity of your body is going to please.

00:04:33.276 --> 00:04:37.321
Anything that is impure has to be thrown away.

00:04:37.401 --> 00:04:42.234
My name itself means purity.

00:04:43.567 --> 00:04:45.737
You can do it.

00:04:45.817 --> 00:04:47.741
You are empowered to do it.

00:04:47.821 --> 00:04:49.570
You have a Kundalini to do it.

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:55.525
But the first thing you have to do is to cleanse that

00:04:57.692 --> 00:05:00.570
and the rest you don’t have to worry,

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:05.112
Shri Ganesha will look after it.

00:05:05.192 --> 00:05:09.259
One chakra you keep clean, the rest is looked after.

00:05:09.339 --> 00:05:12.566
The Mother Kundalini cannot move,

00:05:12.646 --> 00:05:17.967
unless and until Shri Ganesha gives the permission.

00:05:18.047 --> 00:05:22.468
He is like the Vice-Chancellor sitting on all the chakras.

00:05:22.548 --> 00:05:31.550
He has to certify, “All right. Pass. Go,” on every chakra.

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:33.766
And when the Kundalini rises,

00:05:33.846 --> 00:05:40.259
Shri Ganesha is awakened, otherwise Kundalini cannot rise.

00:05:40.339 --> 00:05:42.550
But then when He sleeps down,

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:45.498
Kundalini sucks, is sucked by Him.

00:05:49.837 --> 00:05:56.597
These days people have become extremely cunning,

00:05:56.677 --> 00:06:00.397
and they don’t mind any amount of cunning.

00:06:00.477 --> 00:06:03.957
They play all kinds of cunning games on others

00:06:04.037 --> 00:06:07.997
who are innocent and simple.

00:06:08.077 --> 00:06:11.397
They can justify themselves always

00:06:11.477 --> 00:06:16.477
that whatever they are doing is
the right thing in these modern times

00:06:16.557 --> 00:06:19.757
when everybody is so cunning.

00:06:19.837 --> 00:06:29.918
This cunningness can take you
to the other extreme of right side,

00:06:29.998 --> 00:06:33.437
which is very much punishable,

00:06:33.517 --> 00:06:39.157
in the sense that some people develop all kinds of problems,

00:06:39.237 --> 00:06:43.357
which are physical, you can say.

00:06:43.437 --> 00:06:52.277
Like their hands can get paralyzed
or their leg can get paralyzed.

00:06:52.357 --> 00:06:55.677
Also, they can have other troubles

00:06:55.757 --> 00:06:59.357
with their liver treatments and all that.

00:06:59.437 --> 00:07:05.397
All this comes up. Then to punish them

00:07:05.477 --> 00:07:11.157
a disease of psychosomatic nature might set in.

00:07:11.237 --> 00:07:14.477
At this time, when you have these problems,

00:07:14.557 --> 00:07:17.877
all such people, who suffer from the right side,

00:07:17.957 --> 00:07:20.997
should worship Shri Ganesha.

00:07:21.077 --> 00:07:28.477
For example these days, life is
very much busy with all of you.

00:07:28.557 --> 00:07:33.957
You are extremely busy with your work and you are doing

00:07:34.037 --> 00:07:38.197
extra work, I should say, than normal.

00:07:38.277 --> 00:07:42.877
But you think you are doing a very great job of God.

00:07:42.957 --> 00:07:47.317
As a result Shri Ganesha is neglected

00:07:47.397 --> 00:07:54.797
and such a man can become
either very dry or very self indulgent.

00:07:54.877 --> 00:07:57.597
One of the two things come up

00:07:57.677 --> 00:08:01.917
and he does not know where he is going.

00:08:01.997 --> 00:08:08.117
The only thing that keeps you in the middle,

00:08:08.197 --> 00:08:12.757
in Sahaja Yoga, is Shri Ganesha’s Puja,

00:08:12.837 --> 00:08:20.117
Shri Ganesha’s worship by which
you can always be in the center.

00:08:20.197 --> 00:08:23.395
All these diseases of the right side

00:08:23.475 --> 00:08:27.958
can be cured by Shri Ganesha’s Puja.

00:08:28.038 --> 00:08:33.117
Now there are various ways people worship Shri Ganesha

00:08:34.917 --> 00:08:41.437
but there is a simple way to remember him

00:08:41.517 --> 00:08:46.997
and sit before his photograph and take vibrations from him.

00:08:47.077 --> 00:08:50.917
That’s the best way you can balance yourself.

00:08:50.997 --> 00:08:55.837
There are so many worries, there
are so many struggles you have.

00:08:55.917 --> 00:08:59.717
All these can be neutralized by Shri Ganesha.

00:08:59.797 --> 00:09:04.557
Though innocent, He is extremely clever

00:09:04.637 --> 00:09:09.397
and when he comes to your help you are amazed.

00:09:09.477 --> 00:09:14.357
How he works it out and how he removes all the hurdles

00:09:14.437 --> 00:09:16.483
and all the worries from you.

00:09:20.273 --> 00:09:32.322
With Ganesha so much vibrating, the attention
becomes very concentrated and this concentration

00:09:32.402 --> 00:09:35.275
helps you in so many ways.

00:09:35.355 --> 00:09:42.173
And that is why it is said that
Ganesha was created to spread

00:09:42.253 --> 00:09:50.072
or to emit auspiciousness and holiness.

00:09:50.152 --> 00:09:55.981
Actually, if there is holiness there is auspiciousness.

00:09:56.061 --> 00:10:03.782
For Ganesha is actually the one who cleanses everything,

00:10:03.862 --> 00:10:08.340
cleanses everything because it is innocence.

00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:16.413
And the innocence that cleanses you
takes away all kinds of conditionings and egos

00:10:16.493 --> 00:10:20.082
that are distracting your attention.

00:10:20.162 --> 00:10:26.020
So, the attention which is so
wobbly otherwise, in other places,

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:29.000
can settle down very well in Maharashtra.

00:10:32.687 --> 00:10:34.979
Adi Shakti came as Mahakali

00:10:35.059 --> 00:10:37.780
and created Shri Ganesha.

00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:40.780
Mahakali created Shri Ganesha

00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:45.540
to emit holiness, auspiciousness, wisdom,

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:47.300
Divine wisdom;

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:50.180
and Her establishment of Shri Ganesha

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:53.300
is also within us on the Mooladhara chakra.

00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:57.220
But, if we do not pay attention to our Mooladhara chakra,

00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:59.620
then our powers become very weak

00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:03.020
and we start catching from negativity much more.

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:08.580
Those who have good Mooladharas do not catch, so fast.

00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:11.660
But we catch, we are harmed more by people

00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:13.220
who are negative

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:16.180
because they know that we have bad Mooladharas

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.242
and they can affect us.

00:11:18.322 --> 00:11:20.762
But still one has to remember that

00:11:20.842 --> 00:11:22.762
if we have a strong Mooladhara

00:11:22.842 --> 00:11:26.002
then Mahakali Power is the strongest within us,

00:11:26.082 --> 00:11:30.962
because as I told you, first She created Shri Ganesha.

00:11:31.042 --> 00:11:35.042
So all Her Power are actually expressed in Omkara

00:11:35.122 --> 00:11:37.282
which is Shri Ganesh.

00:11:37.362 --> 00:11:42.082
And this Shri Ganesh Power within us represents

00:11:42.162 --> 00:11:44.402
the complete love of Mahakali

00:11:44.482 --> 00:11:48.962
and all Her Powers of destroying the evil forces.

00:11:49.042 --> 00:11:55.682
They go hand-in-hand we should say like, every

00:11:55.762 --> 00:12:00.882
light has its glory around it, or glow around it.

00:12:00.962 --> 00:12:06.002
In the same way the light of Mahakali

00:12:06.082 --> 00:12:09.442
has the glow, as chaitanya,

00:12:09.522 --> 00:12:13.288
which is actually nothing but Omkara

00:12:13.368 --> 00:12:15.194
and Shri Ganesha.

00:12:19.313 --> 00:12:22.193
So, it is a pilgrimage, in a way, that we are here.

00:12:22.273 --> 00:12:29.083
That we have to look after our
Mahalakshmi principle of our ascent.

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:38.181
As you know, this ascent starts at the Nabhi

00:12:38.261 --> 00:12:41.856
and is surrounded by the Guru principle.

00:12:41.936 --> 00:12:47.904
Now the Guru principle within us,
if it is absurd, if it is a juxtaposition,

00:12:47.984 --> 00:12:54.461
placed in a juxtaposition where, if it
is not properly embedded within us,

00:12:54.541 --> 00:12:59.381
if it is not emitting through our character and behaviour,

00:12:59.461 --> 00:13:01.829
Mahalakshmi tattva cannot be strengthened.

00:13:01.909 --> 00:13:05.429
Mahalakshmi tattva is strengthened through Guru principle.

00:13:05.509 --> 00:13:08.450
It is also Vishuddhi, which is also Nabhi, comes from Nabhi,

00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:13.684
because you must know that Vishuddhi
Chakra is the ascent of the Nabhi Chakra.

00:13:13.764 --> 00:13:20.077
So, what happens, that a person whatever
he is, is expressed through his language,

00:13:20.157 --> 00:13:25.214
through his behaviour, his face, his nose, 
his eyes, everything, through the Vishuddhi Chakra.

00:13:25.294 --> 00:13:30.001
So, the ascent of the Nabhi is expressed,
shown, through the Vishuddhi Chakra.

00:13:30.081 --> 00:13:33.026
Now whatever you have in the Nabhi is shown here.

00:13:33.106 --> 00:13:40.154
So, outwardly it is Mahalakshmi tattva, but
inside is, inside is - we can say, there are 3 cores.

00:13:40.234 --> 00:13:45.123
The first core is Mahalakshmi tattva,
outside to look at, you see the growth, all right.

00:13:45.203 --> 00:13:52.685
Then inside is the creation, that is all
the elements being created and all that.

00:13:52.765 --> 00:14:00.345
But inside that is the desire and
inside the desire is the half one (egg),

00:14:00.425 --> 00:14:06.233
you can say, is the Ganesha. (Before our era)

00:14:06.313 --> 00:14:13.397
So this Ganesha tattwa ultimately overpowers
in everything and permeates through everything.

00:14:18.130 --> 00:14:20.896
But first thing you must know you have to be honest,

00:14:20.976 --> 00:14:24.521
very honest in Sahaja Yoga.

00:14:24.601 --> 00:14:28.849
The honesty is like - I have seen people.

00:14:28.929 --> 00:14:33.287
If we have a dinner, say, for a marriage-party,

00:14:33.367 --> 00:14:37.146
they'll just crawl into it without having any self-respect,

00:14:37.226 --> 00:14:39.530
without having any understanding as to

00:14:39.610 --> 00:14:43.009
who is going to pay for the all
this? They'll bring all their family,

00:14:43.089 --> 00:14:46.119
come down and sit down.

00:14:46.199 --> 00:14:51.666
There are people who avoid paying money

00:14:51.746 --> 00:14:55.869
which should be paid for Sahaja Yoga.

00:14:55.949 --> 00:14:58.877
Supposing, they're eating food or they are travelling

00:14:58.957 --> 00:15:02.963
or they're coming from abroad,

00:15:03.043 --> 00:15:07.197
they have to pay money for their travelling, for their food.

00:15:07.277 --> 00:15:10.892
And, sometimes, you know I have to pay lot of money.

00:15:10.972 --> 00:15:14.344
Doesn't matter, I don't mind. But is not good for you,

00:15:14.424 --> 00:15:17.914
the main thing it's not good for you.

00:15:17.994 --> 00:15:21.535
So, how you behave towards Sahaja Yoga

00:15:21.615 --> 00:15:24.504
as far as money is concerned is also very important,

00:15:24.584 --> 00:15:28.785
though it looks gross. But it can give a big trouble

00:15:28.865 --> 00:15:33.496
in the unfoldment because of the Nabhi catching

00:15:33.576 --> 00:15:36.644
and, as you know, if the Nabhi catches

00:15:36.724 --> 00:15:40.769
it can spread up to the whole of void.

00:15:40.849 --> 00:15:44.110
And if the void is catching Ekadesha Rudra,

00:15:44.190 --> 00:15:47.356
which is placed here, the destructive forces, built-in.

00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:58.838
So, I would suggest that French
must aim, first of all, at speaking less.

00:15:58.918 --> 00:16:03.083
Bring it to minimum, better not speak much.

00:16:03.163 --> 00:16:07.564
And when you come back from your work, then you are excited.

00:16:07.644 --> 00:16:12.014
The nerves are not under your control,
because you have never tried to control them,

00:16:12.094 --> 00:16:16.877
and you start talking and jabbering with
each other saying all sort of nonsensical things,

00:16:16.957 --> 00:16:19.325
this one is excited, that one is excited.

00:16:19.405 --> 00:16:25.938
Better have a silent meditation, absolutely
silent meditation for an hour every day.

00:16:26.018 --> 00:16:30.232
Practise it because we have to
imbibe the new culture of Sahaja Yoga

00:16:30.312 --> 00:16:34.614
in which seriousness is not wanted of the English,

00:16:34.694 --> 00:16:38.961
but also, we do not want the frivolousness of the French.

00:16:39.041 --> 00:16:44.344
Now, in between is serenity and the blissful state.

00:16:44.424 --> 00:16:48.810
To achieve that, you have to practise silence.

00:16:48.890 --> 00:16:53.084
After one hour of silent meditation
– which may be too much for you

00:16:53.164 --> 00:16:56.097
to remain silent for one hour, but try,

00:16:56.177 --> 00:16:59.578
for at least two weeks you try this – and then, gradually,

00:16:59.658 --> 00:17:04.269
you can have half an hour silent
meditation and start my tape.

00:17:04.349 --> 00:17:11.366
Listen to my tape without
talking. Try to listen than to talk.

00:17:11.446 --> 00:17:15.664
So, this is the problem. It is
also an aggressive temperament

00:17:15.744 --> 00:17:22.288
by which you spoil your Vishuddhi completely, and
the Right Vishuddhi is the real problem with the French.

00:17:22.368 --> 00:17:28.347
Then, from Right Vishuddhi it descends to Left
Vishuddhi, Left Nabhi because you become frantic.

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:37.468
In Sahaja Yoga you must have
seen that you have become playful

00:17:37.548 --> 00:17:45.640
– in music, in everything you become engrossed
and enjoy all that, with love among one another.

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:51.570
There is a pure feelings, in Sahaja Yoga there
is a completely pure feelings among each other.

00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:57.793
You also do everything virtuously and
beautifully, there is no doubt about that.

00:17:57.873 --> 00:18:06.217
But being only playful is stopping at the Vishuddhi.

00:18:06.297 --> 00:18:12.516
At Vishuddhi there is playfulness,
then you come to the Agnya.

00:18:12.596 --> 00:18:19.780
At Agnya chakra it is ‘tapah’ [penance], it is penance.

00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:24.597
It’s alright for today and tomorrow, you
can play Holi, sing songs, you can dance.

00:18:24.677 --> 00:18:30.525
You can dance today also – there is no problem.

00:18:30.605 --> 00:18:35.203
But after that it is important to reach your Agnya.

00:18:35.283 --> 00:18:45.244
Because by such behavior the joy
you get, the purity you experience,

00:18:45.325 --> 00:18:51.919
the brotherhood you experience, the Universal
brotherhood that is felt – from that you spread out.

00:18:51.999 --> 00:19:00.901
But to reach the depth, is it necessary that you do penance.

00:19:00.981 --> 00:19:08.276
This is up to you to see within
yourself – ‘where is our attention’?

00:19:08.356 --> 00:19:14.528
This is the penance, the penance in Sahaja Yoga is to see –

00:19:14.608 --> 00:19:20.209
‘where is my attention?’, ‘where
am I going?’ where is my mind going?’

00:19:20.289 --> 00:19:24.868
If you can do this then you have crossed over Agnya.

00:19:24.948 --> 00:19:29.980
And there is no question in
Sahasrara at all as I am sitting there.

00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:37.406
But if you haven’t crossed over the
Agnya, then it becomes difficult at Sahasrara

00:19:37.486 --> 00:19:42.091
as there is a very narrow space in the Agnya

00:19:42.171 --> 00:19:47.357
That is why between the Agnya
and Vishuddhi there is a close relation

00:19:47.437 --> 00:19:52.895
and you know that it is of the Father and the Son.

00:19:52.975 --> 00:20:03.419
So deep in the relation. So staying very serious,
unnecessarily frowning and being authoritative.

00:20:03.499 --> 00:20:08.617
Some people are serious to be authoritative,
some people talk for no reason at all

00:20:08.697 --> 00:20:20.601
– like this, from both the things the Vishuddhi
gets spoilt. But talking nicely to comfort someone,

00:20:20.681 --> 00:20:26.656
talking nicely to show love to someone, talking
beautifully to end the arguments among one another,

00:20:26.736 --> 00:20:33.830
with all this the Vishuddhi
chakra will start becoming alright.

00:20:33.910 --> 00:20:37.603
Like this when the Vishuddhi becomes alright you see that

00:20:37.683 --> 00:20:42.719
‘when I talk to someone, am I
talking superficially? Is there depth?

00:20:42.799 --> 00:20:55.896
Then you should understand ‘what is my depth’?

00:20:55.976 --> 00:21:03.446
You’ll say, “O.K, tomorrow I’ll get this for you”.

00:21:03.526 --> 00:21:08.951
Then person who is of low level, the person who is shallow,

00:21:09.031 --> 00:21:15.018
will just get something shallow
only because it has to be given.

00:21:15.098 --> 00:21:18.457
There is no effect of it.

00:21:18.537 --> 00:21:28.470
But if someone gives even a small flower from
heart that can have a lot of effect in Sahaja Yoga.

00:21:28.550 --> 00:21:31.930
It is said, ‘do a work with your heart’.

00:21:32.010 --> 00:21:38.884
If you are friendly to anyone don’t
keep it on the surface, it should be deep.

00:21:38.964 --> 00:21:44.672
In the Vishuddhi, till we don’t reach the depth of Agnya,

00:21:44.752 --> 00:21:50.532
then the Vishuddhi will remain very shallow.
It is very essential to have the depth of Agnya.

00:21:50.612 --> 00:21:58.041
The depth of Agnya is that you
don’t do something by thinking about.

00:21:58.121 --> 00:22:02.174
So on the ‘Holi’ day we should remove all that

00:22:02.254 --> 00:22:08.278
from which our attention gets spoilt,
so that our Agnya doesn’t gets spoilt.

00:22:08.358 --> 00:22:15.818
Both the things – the attention gets purified,
and in joy and awakening we celebrate Holi.

00:22:15.898 --> 00:22:21.471
The day when complete combinations takes place,

00:22:21.551 --> 00:22:29.478
when they are in balance – these two chakras [Vishuddhi
and Agnya], then Sahasrara will not have any problem.

00:22:29.558 --> 00:22:34.648
But these two chakras create problems.

00:22:34.728 --> 00:22:46.798
You know that both the Nadis rise from
the Vishuddhi and cross at the Agnya.

00:22:46.878 --> 00:22:50.998
There is a lot of connection with the Vishuddhi.

00:22:51.078 --> 00:22:56.375
That is why when the attention goes towards Vishuddhi,

00:22:56.455 --> 00:23:01.957
towards Shri Krishna then His special Power

00:23:02.037 --> 00:23:07.997
who was Radhaji and the Power of
Radhaji is the Allahad -Allahadayini

00:23:08.077 --> 00:23:13.105
Allahadayini – meaning giving Allahad to others, giving joy.

00:23:13.185 --> 00:23:16.522
She had the Power to give joy to others.

00:23:16.602 --> 00:23:24.335
Just seeing Her people became
joyous – be it animals, birds – everyone.

00:23:24.415 --> 00:23:31.320
This come from the Vishuddhi that
whoever sees, they become happy

00:23:36.175 --> 00:23:41.168
But everyone should strive to
understand where our benefit lies.

00:23:41.248 --> 00:23:47.916
Our benefit is not to wander and wander like mad.

00:23:47.996 --> 00:23:51.930
Obtaining that eternal thing is the goal of our life,

00:23:52.010 --> 00:23:54.230
and that’s why we have come into Sahajyoga.

00:23:54.310 --> 00:23:58.285
And if, after coming into Sahajyoga, we
remain incomplete, then what’s the use?

00:23:58.365 --> 00:23:59.586
What have we gained?

00:23:59.666 --> 00:24:06.534
If we sit halfway on the path we have embarked
upon, we won’t reach the destination at all.

00:24:06.614 --> 00:24:11.773
I have talked many times about
this Shivtatva and explained it,

00:24:11.853 --> 00:24:19.186
but especially for the people of
Delhi, Shivtatva should be discussed.

00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:25.185
So, the thing about Shivtatva is that you should know that

00:24:25.265 --> 00:24:30.350
when the heart catches you, your Agnya Chakra catches.

00:24:30.430 --> 00:24:33.556
But on the contrary, if I say, if your Agnya Chakra catches,

00:24:33.636 --> 00:24:42.212
the one in front, then your heart suddenly contracts,

00:24:42.292 --> 00:24:44.873
becomes very small.

00:24:44.953 --> 00:24:49.323
And when your Agnya Chakra opens,
your heart becomes completely cool,

00:24:49.403 --> 00:24:54.317
and vibrations start flowing from it.

00:24:54.397 --> 00:24:57.157
The Agnya Chakra rises with ego

00:25:00.899 --> 00:25:06.680
Try to be extremely peaceful,
try to make your forehead relaxed.

00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:09.447
Many people come to Me with [face] like this, you see,

00:25:09.527 --> 00:25:12.713
then I just know that there is
a big bhoot on the head sitting;

00:25:12.793 --> 00:25:14.894
then I shout at them.

00:25:14.974 --> 00:25:17.884
Keep your forehead relaxed, relaxed.

00:25:17.964 --> 00:25:21.752
“I am not doing anything, Mother is
doing everything. Relax, relax, relax.”

00:25:21.832 --> 00:25:27.490
If you relax, you’ll find that your heart will open.

00:25:27.570 --> 00:25:31.058
“My heart cannot open.” Why, why can’t you open your heart?

00:25:31.138 --> 00:25:34.673
Because you have no trust in yourself.

00:25:34.753 --> 00:25:39.305
Try to trust yourself, open your Agnya, open your Ekadasha

00:25:39.385 --> 00:25:45.260
and your Sahasrara, and your heart
will open. Once your Sahasrara is open,

00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:49.522
your heart will open automatically,
so you will have a peaceful life.

00:25:49.602 --> 00:25:52.447
So today I am asking for two things from you.

00:25:52.527 --> 00:25:55.860
It's a funny thing that a Mother has to ask for a gift.

00:25:55.940 --> 00:26:00.423
And the gift you have to give - first one
- is that you should be peaceful people.

00:26:00.503 --> 00:26:05.337
You should express peacefulness
through your own character, talking.

00:26:05.417 --> 00:26:15.160
And [the] second one is the..., this peace and all this

00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:20.105
should express your love to others, love to others.

00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:27.958
Cancer sign is the sign of the Mother only;

00:26:28.038 --> 00:26:34.173
and when you try to commit
sins against the Mother this starts.

00:26:34.253 --> 00:26:41.342
because sin against the Mother is
the biggest sin in the modern times.

00:26:41.422 --> 00:26:49.059
So, one must know that the sin against
the Mother will lead, equal, to cancer.

00:26:49.139 --> 00:26:52.390
So it started from Ganesha tattwa.

00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:57.195
Many people who have this problem, Ganesha problem,

00:26:57.275 --> 00:27:02.481
they may be very good in other things
but still, if there is the left Ganesha problem,

00:27:02.561 --> 00:27:05.795
they should be very, very careful.

00:27:05.875 --> 00:27:11.200
It’s like a hole in your being.

00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:15.290
And to overcome that problem you
may cover up with something else.

00:27:15.370 --> 00:27:18.803
Like such people may say, “Oh, I
am so great. I will never feel like this.”

00:27:18.883 --> 00:27:21.520
That’s not a good thing.

00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:26.571
Just overcome your Ganesha
problem with which you are perverted.

00:27:26.651 --> 00:27:30.119
So all these perversions must be sucked in just like

00:27:30.199 --> 00:27:37.480
a tortoise sucks in the four limbs within themselves.

00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:42.629
That is how you must suck in those things.

00:27:42.709 --> 00:27:46.236
And do not try to overcome by Right Vishuddhi,

00:27:46.316 --> 00:27:50.736
by saying that you are great
or you are this or you are that.

00:27:50.816 --> 00:27:54.436
Some people I have seen also try to show off about it

00:27:54.516 --> 00:27:57.643
and try to say things which looks quite big,

00:27:57.723 --> 00:28:01.971
but ultimately I find that they have a Left Mooladhara.

00:28:02.051 --> 00:28:08.538
It’s a serious thing it is, very, very serious. So
be careful. Don’t deceive yourself. Anyone of you.

00:28:08.618 --> 00:28:16.525
Those who have Left Mooladhara
problem have to be extremely careful

00:28:16.605 --> 00:28:23.263
not to be tempted to any
supraconscious behaviour or talking.

00:28:23.343 --> 00:28:29.208
Try to overcome it by complete surrendering,
say “I do not know anything Mother.”

00:28:29.288 --> 00:28:33.287
[That’s the] first mantra for them.
“Mother, I do not know anything”.

00:28:33.367 --> 00:28:36.968
If you surrender. Because it’s a Mother.

00:28:37.048 --> 00:28:41.796
Like Shri Ganesha. He never shows off anything.

00:28:41.876 --> 00:28:45.428
He’s just surrendered, completely. He says, “I do not know!”

00:28:45.508 --> 00:28:48.527
So Left Mooladhara is a very serious problem.

00:28:48.607 --> 00:28:57.001
Be careful of it. It can be
infectious. It can be just catch over.

00:28:57.081 --> 00:29:03.440
Sahaja Yoga has only that very delicate
point among Western Sahaja Yogis.

00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:10.401
Only on this point – Left Mooladhara – so be careful.

00:29:10.481 --> 00:29:14.514
Try to keep your attention
clear. Perversions – keep it away.

00:29:14.594 --> 00:29:17.341
Try to keep yourself, your chakras alright.

00:29:17.421 --> 00:29:21.233
Better thing is to look after
your chakras than to discuss it.

00:29:21.313 --> 00:29:26.110
Don’t go int o that trip of knowing through your brains.

00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:29.068
Know through your heart.

00:29:29.148 --> 00:29:33.130
And that’s the reason [you do that]
is because it’s not available to you.

00:29:33.210 --> 00:29:38.548
That’s the base. The Left Mooladhara
is harmed so you turn to another thing!

00:29:38.628 --> 00:29:40.894
That’s not available.

00:29:40.974 --> 00:29:46.028
That innocence is not available.

00:29:46.108 --> 00:29:48.828
Try to go to that.

00:29:48.908 --> 00:29:56.579
Try to awaken that within you and then you
will be amazed [that] you will know me better.

00:29:56.659 --> 00:30:01.980
Also, I think, another way to put your Mooladhara alright

00:30:02.060 --> 00:30:07.427
is to see how long you can remain without blinking.

00:30:10.007 --> 00:30:17.236
Now just ask, “Mother, take us deep into our stillness.”

00:30:21.659 --> 00:30:24.687
Don’t close your eyes.

00:30:37.870 --> 00:30:41.119
You need not say loudly, just say it in your heart.

00:30:41.199 --> 00:30:44.300
Don’t worry about others, worry
just about your own Sahasrara. See?

00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:49.171
It’s like a stone. Can you follow?

00:30:52.198 --> 00:30:58.248
So, surrender. Just in your heart, surrender. Surrender.

00:30:58.328 --> 00:31:02.467
Put me down there – your Sahasrara will open.

00:31:10.904 --> 00:31:13.131
The great journey.

00:31:15.725 --> 00:31:19.965
Forget about everything else. Just do that.

00:31:27.503 --> 00:31:29.610
Better.

00:31:34.605 --> 00:31:38.104
Sahasrara better now?

00:32:20.269 --> 00:32:27.330
Alright? You are my children. You are my sons and daughters

00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:43.008
Alright? Better now? See on your Sahasrara.

00:33:05.092 --> 00:33:09.285
Mother, You are God.

00:33:30.174 --> 00:33:33.801
“Make us like Shri Ganesh.”

00:33:40.950 --> 00:33:42.873
Raise your Kundalini!

00:33:42.953 --> 00:33:45.599
Just do it slowly, slowly.

00:33:48.113 --> 00:33:51.602
Higher, put it higher, very much higher.

00:33:57.089 --> 00:33:59.379
Do it properly.

00:34:01.226 --> 00:34:06.201
With full attention. Not in a small way.

00:34:06.281 --> 00:34:12.182
Push it back. The whole hand, up there.

00:34:14.970 --> 00:34:17.447
Again.

00:34:20.043 --> 00:34:24.171
With all your earnest attention.

00:34:25.372 --> 00:34:35.238
In a knot, three times. One, two…

00:34:47.492 --> 00:34:49.579
Things should be done fully and properly.

00:34:49.659 --> 00:34:54.518
Not half way. I have seen the way people give
bandhan, the way people raise their Kundalini.

00:34:54.598 --> 00:34:58.073
It’s not the way! Do it properly.

00:34:58.153 --> 00:35:04.236
You are saints! You are archbishops of saints.

00:35:04.316 --> 00:35:10.412
You are the foundations of all the saints that have to come.

00:35:10.492 --> 00:35:12.442
May God bless you all.
