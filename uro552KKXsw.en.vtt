00:00:07.165 --> 00:00:09.085
Now,

00:00:09.205 --> 00:00:12.905
I have to tell you how to
give yourself the Kavach

00:00:12.986 --> 00:00:14.046
to protect yourself,

00:00:14.712 --> 00:00:15.852
it's very important;

00:00:16.722 --> 00:00:18.692
and how to raise your kundalini,

00:00:18.772 --> 00:00:21.892
it's very important, very
simple - he'll show you also.

00:00:23.172 --> 00:00:26.122
Put your left hand like this in front of you,

00:00:26.768 --> 00:00:30.661
and the right hand you have to move,
the left hand goes straight.

00:00:30.742 --> 00:00:33.662
So you have to - I'll just
show you first of all, like this.

00:00:33.742 --> 00:00:39.772
It goes up onto your head,
and here you give it one knot.

00:00:41.672 --> 00:00:43.772
Now, again we'll start now, properly.

00:00:44.692 --> 00:00:46.692
We start it from here.

00:00:46.752 --> 00:00:49.792
Now start moving your left hand upward.

00:00:50.752 --> 00:00:52.892
For fixing up your kundalini,

00:00:53.732 --> 00:00:56.892
put your hand up and give it one knot;

00:00:58.852 --> 00:01:01.672
then again, the second one.

00:01:05.802 --> 00:01:07.892
Give it the second knot.

00:01:08.752 --> 00:01:10.762
Third knot you have to give three times.

00:01:10.842 --> 00:01:12.902
Now again do it, please:

00:01:18.762 --> 00:01:22.872
one, it's two,

00:01:24.692 --> 00:01:28.872
and three. Done! Now the Kavach.

00:01:29.742 --> 00:01:32.792
You have to take for your
protection every morning

00:01:32.872 --> 00:01:36.712
when you go out, and
before sleeping you should

00:01:36.772 --> 00:01:38.722
put your attention here and sleep off.

00:01:38.822 --> 00:01:41.742
Put the left hand towards Me like this.

00:01:45.672 --> 00:01:47.732
It is Saadhe teen...

00:01:48.672 --> 00:01:51.892
the three-and-a half coils.

00:01:52.862 --> 00:01:54.762
So how do you give Kavach?

00:01:54.842 --> 00:01:58.672
It's, put left hand towards
Me, towards the photograph,

00:01:58.762 --> 00:02:00.782
put the right hand like this -

00:02:00.882 --> 00:02:02.752
I'll show you first of all.

00:02:02.832 --> 00:02:07.772
Then raise it like this,
bring it down - this is half.

00:02:08.832 --> 00:02:13.702
Then again you take it back - this is one.

00:02:14.722 --> 00:02:21.702
Again you take it up, is
again you take it back - is two.

00:02:22.782 --> 00:02:26.682
Again you take it like this,

00:02:27.852 --> 00:02:30.682
again you bring it back - is three.

00:02:30.782 --> 00:02:32.762
And now you take it back only halfway,

00:02:32.842 --> 00:02:35.672
so three-and-a-half times.

00:02:38.772 --> 00:02:41.822
This is bandhan, is the Kavach,

00:02:42.752 --> 00:02:45.672
Kavach of protection.

00:02:47.328 --> 00:02:49.518
Also lots of things you'll learn,

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:52.337
how to use this power from your hand.

00:02:52.418 --> 00:02:54.781
Now, all those who have felt

00:02:55.428 --> 00:02:58.398
cool or hot breeze in their hands

00:02:58.672 --> 00:03:02.511
or out of your fontanel bone area,

00:03:02.732 --> 00:03:04.692
please raise your both hands.

00:03:04.762 --> 00:03:08.672
All those who have felt,
please raise both your hands.

00:03:11.891 --> 00:03:14.621
They have a little problem
of liver, but it will work out,

00:03:14.702 --> 00:03:16.762
it doesn't matter.

00:03:17.832 --> 00:03:19.752
May God bless you all,

00:03:19.832 --> 00:03:21.862
may God bless you.

00:03:29.061 --> 00:03:33.441
So Madras should become now Mada Raas,

00:03:33.528 --> 00:03:36.337
means all the Mada (vanity) is finished

00:03:39.018 --> 00:03:41.741
and achieve that state.

00:03:41.822 --> 00:03:46.761
May God bless you all.
Again and again I tell you,

00:03:46.842 --> 00:03:50.732
be humble and come to the center.

00:03:50.822 --> 00:03:53.852
There are some very good
Sahaja yogis in the center.

00:03:54.742 --> 00:03:58.772
They'll all tell you everything
with very loving way.

00:03:59.692 --> 00:04:03.852
But please come, and
pay attention to yourself,

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.662
and know everything.

00:04:09.052 --> 00:04:12.152
Next year I will come again to Madras.

00:04:13.722 --> 00:04:15.832
May God bless you.
