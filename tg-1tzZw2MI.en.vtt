00:00:37.505 --> 00:00:42.824
Marriage is an auspicious occasion,

00:00:43.025 --> 00:00:48.587
is the most auspicious occasion in the life of human beings.

00:00:49.126 --> 00:00:53.211
It is auspicious, that's why its joy giving

00:00:53.412 --> 00:00:56.562
and the vibrations flow

00:00:56.763 --> 00:01:00.483
with that auspiciousness all over the world.

00:01:00.684 --> 00:01:06.257
The joy of Sahaja Yogis today in England, London

00:01:06.458 --> 00:01:09.465
should spread all over the world.

00:01:09.809 --> 00:01:15.137
Marriage is meant to give joy,

00:01:15.544 --> 00:01:20.806
is meant to give cheerfulness, happiness

00:01:21.007 --> 00:01:28.294
and all the blissful things that we can think of achieving

00:01:28.495 --> 00:01:38.548
through our combination with two human beings, we can say.

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:46.625
It's a very close and private relationship

00:01:46.826 --> 00:01:49.788
which has to be respected.

00:01:49.989 --> 00:01:55.554
It is not to be in any way dishonored

00:01:55.755 --> 00:02:00.012
or indiscreetly squandered away.

00:02:00.787 --> 00:02:04.709
Those who cannot respect their partners in life

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:08.433
will never be respected anywhere else.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.955
Those who ill-treat or in any way

00:02:15.156 --> 00:02:20.222
try to spoil the image of their partners

00:02:20.423 --> 00:02:23.256
are harming themselves.

00:02:23.457 --> 00:02:27.407
Try to understand each other,

00:02:27.608 --> 00:02:29.760
decorate each other,

00:02:29.961 --> 00:02:34.619
not correction, but decorating. Like an ornament,

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:39.837
when added to a personality decorates that person,

00:02:40.038 --> 00:02:43.041
in the same way, try to decorate another person.

00:02:43.242 --> 00:02:46.962
So the decorum and decency of life

00:02:47.163 --> 00:02:50.001
comes from this auspicious relationship.

00:02:50.202 --> 00:02:52.658
That must be maintained.

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:56.622
Marriage is the bondage that keeps the society

00:02:56.823 --> 00:03:02.776
in its own beautiful bondage of Mother's grace.

00:03:06.901 --> 00:03:11.654
Give up all your old ideas,

00:03:11.855 --> 00:03:19.921
all your so-called modern methods

00:03:20.122 --> 00:03:23.782
by which we have ruined our married lives.

00:03:23.983 --> 00:03:29.263
If you cannot enjoy your own wife or your own husband,

00:03:29.464 --> 00:03:31.781
there's nothing in this world you can enjoy,

00:03:31.982 --> 00:03:37.142
because the relationship is the most intimate and very sacred.

00:03:37.343 --> 00:03:41.605
So you have to forget that you live independently,

00:03:41.806 --> 00:03:48.169
now you live as one person, one personality,

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.922
supporting energy,

00:03:53.123 --> 00:03:57.056
complimenting each other in complete concord.

00:03:57.257 --> 00:04:01.580
This creates that peace which we are talking about.

00:04:01.781 --> 00:04:05.556
If the marriages are not successful of two persons,

00:04:05.757 --> 00:04:10.941
how do we expect the whole nation to live happily? Think of it.

00:04:11.142 --> 00:04:17.066
At this level, the seeds of peace are sown.

00:04:17.267 --> 00:04:21.319
So we have to be sensible people, that's the main part of marriage is:

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:25.205
how far we are sensible about it.

00:04:25.406 --> 00:04:29.920
It's easy to get into tantrums, get into tempers,

00:04:30.121 --> 00:04:36.674
to get into some sort of an indecent, indiscreet habit.

00:04:36.875 --> 00:04:39.809
But the person who is sensible

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:43.262
never crosses a certain limit of that decency.

00:04:43.463 --> 00:04:47.588
Once you cross it, it is very easy to cross again.

00:04:48.268 --> 00:04:51.245
That's what today when we read about Rama

00:04:51.446 --> 00:04:54.550
is that He is a maryada purushottam.

00:04:54.751 --> 00:04:57.852
Maryada is the boundary in which one has to remain.

00:04:58.053 --> 00:05:00.158
A woman has to remain in her boundary

00:05:00.359 --> 00:05:03.422
and a man has to remain in his boundary.

00:05:03.623 --> 00:05:06.050
Now to think that the woman is dominated by man

00:05:06.251 --> 00:05:07.944
or man is dominated by woman

00:05:08.145 --> 00:05:12.883
comes from a kind of a complex and this complex must be given up.

00:05:13.084 --> 00:05:17.130
You are complimentary to each other.

00:05:17.331 --> 00:05:19.259
You decorate each other.

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:25.249
Never talk ill of your husbands and never talk ill of your wives.

00:05:25.965 --> 00:05:31.527
This is the key of having an exclusive married life.

00:05:31.728 --> 00:05:35.073
If you start talking of each other to others,

00:05:35.274 --> 00:05:39.050
that exclusiveness, that trust is finished.

00:05:39.251 --> 00:05:44.553
So you have to trust each other. The trust in God,

00:05:44.754 --> 00:05:50.280
children imbibe when they start learning from their parents

00:05:50.481 --> 00:05:53.102
how they trust each other.

00:05:53.303 --> 00:05:57.637
So you are the nest where the tomorrow's great children

00:05:57.838 --> 00:06:00.203
are to be born,

00:06:00.404 --> 00:06:06.247
to be established and to grow as great saints.

00:06:06.848 --> 00:06:10.771
So it is such a great occasion that nine marriages have taken place.

00:06:10.972 --> 00:06:17.100
Nine is a very auspicious number for Me.

00:06:17.301 --> 00:06:19.882
There are nine planets, there are Nava Durgas.

00:06:20.083 --> 00:06:22.466
Nava Durgas are there.

00:06:22.667 --> 00:06:29.565
Nava Durgas are the nine forms of Durga.

00:06:29.978 --> 00:06:32.627
Nine forms of Mother.

00:06:32.828 --> 00:06:35.722
And that is something so great today has happened.

00:06:35.923 --> 00:06:39.664
It's a very good day and all of you

00:06:39.865 --> 00:06:43.389
should understand the value of Sahaja Yoga marriages.

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:48.308
You have to create a model marriage for all the English,

00:06:48.509 --> 00:06:51.953
for all the Americans, Europeans and also Indians.

00:06:52.154 --> 00:06:54.337
Because Indians learn from you all these things.

00:06:54.538 --> 00:06:56.483
If you have model marriages,

00:06:56.684 --> 00:06:59.879
they will go in for model marriages also.

00:07:00.557 --> 00:07:05.499
So it is important for people who live in England

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:12.722
to understand the depth of this occasion

00:07:12.923 --> 00:07:18.397
and the esteem of what you mean

00:07:18.598 --> 00:07:22.762
to the whole universe and to the peace.

00:07:23.158 --> 00:07:27.954
The enjoyment is your own, is exclusive.

00:07:28.236 --> 00:07:32.702
But in Sahaja Yoga, it is so collective, you could see that.

00:07:32.903 --> 00:07:37.476
It is so collective, you have so many brothers and sisters

00:07:37.677 --> 00:07:42.544
and we are all enjoying the joy of

00:07:42.745 --> 00:07:47.563
you couples who have joined together as husband and wife.

00:07:47.764 --> 00:07:51.287
So one has to understand that marriage

00:07:51.488 --> 00:07:56.264
should not make you narrow minded or selfish

00:07:56.465 --> 00:07:58.771
or in any way cut off from others.

00:07:58.972 --> 00:08:03.710
All relationships are beautiful in their own forms.

00:08:03.911 --> 00:08:09.248
Like you have brothers and sisters, you have mothers and fathers,

00:08:09.449 --> 00:08:12.918
you've got Sahaja Yoga and you have got the children.

00:08:13.119 --> 00:08:19.573
All in their own form should be given what they deserve,

00:08:19.774 --> 00:08:25.247
what they have to have, what the right thing is to be done.

00:08:25.448 --> 00:08:37.748
Marriage gives you now a lever to be dharmic, to be moral.

00:08:38.259 --> 00:08:45.985
This teaches you how to respect the chastity of others

00:08:46.186 --> 00:08:49.428
and your own chastity.

00:08:50.666 --> 00:08:52.658
We have to teach ourselves.

00:08:52.859 --> 00:08:56.009
You know how much damage has been already done

00:08:56.210 --> 00:08:59.046
by having bad marriages, divorces.

00:08:59.247 --> 00:09:03.033
We have to teach ourselves, we have to bear up a little bit,

00:09:03.234 --> 00:09:07.553
we have to educate, re-educate and

00:09:07.754 --> 00:09:12.101
improve ourselves and not to say that

00:09:12.302 --> 00:09:16.029
"I am such and such, what can I do?"

00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:22.129
You have to bring glory to the system of marriages

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:27.447
because it is the system established by God Almighty,

00:09:27.648 --> 00:09:30.345
is not established by human beings, is a wrong idea.

00:09:30.546 --> 00:09:36.291
It is established by God Almighty to have an auspicious occasion

00:09:36.492 --> 00:09:38.851
where such an auspicious thing is taken,

00:09:39.052 --> 00:09:42.770
the sacredness of this is to be maintained

00:09:42.971 --> 00:09:48.931
and has to be done in such a way it is a very decent relationship.

00:09:50.822 --> 00:09:53.055
All the culture,

00:09:53.256 --> 00:09:58.123
all the beauty of gracious living

00:09:58.324 --> 00:10:02.119
flows through happy married life.

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:06.319
Not vulgar, not showing,

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:08.527
not cheap,

00:10:08.728 --> 00:10:13.622
but a dignified, enjoyable, cheerful,

00:10:13.823 --> 00:10:18.994
welcoming, giving companionship.

00:10:20.911 --> 00:10:24.975
I am sure you all realize the importance of it

00:10:25.176 --> 00:10:30.707
and I am sure you all must have prepared yourself for this occasion.

00:10:32.398 --> 00:10:36.416
 And I would like to see among all of you,

00:10:36.617 --> 00:10:44.603
who really shows the complete acceptance of your partners

00:10:44.804 --> 00:10:49.324
as part and parcel of your being

00:10:49.525 --> 00:10:54.626
and the graciousness with which you handle them.

00:10:54.983 --> 00:11:00.060
I bless you all. You are all saints and saints have married here.

00:11:00.261 --> 00:11:02.845
All the angels and all celestial beings

00:11:03.046 --> 00:11:05.393
must be singing praise of you.

00:11:05.594 --> 00:11:10.080
So be careful and assume,

00:11:10.281 --> 00:11:16.760
assume your positions as in Hindi language, we say biraji,

00:11:16.961 --> 00:11:24.128
to assume that position in your full esteem and glory.

00:11:24.329 --> 00:11:29.065
We all are with you all the time to help you to sustain

00:11:29.266 --> 00:11:30.563
your relationships.

00:11:30.764 --> 00:11:34.777
All of us must see that we sustain their relations,

00:11:34.978 --> 00:11:39.577
make them feel the sweetness of married life.

00:11:39.778 --> 00:11:45.179
All the teasing, and all that should add up to their relationship

00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:49.552
and the whole enjoyment of their companionship

00:11:49.753 --> 00:11:55.470
should flow to us as the ripples flow towards the shores

00:11:55.671 --> 00:11:58.356
and again are repelled back into the ocean,

00:11:58.557 --> 00:12:02.849
in the same way, it should be such a give-and-take

00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:04.879
and such a beautiful thing.

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:11.408
For that, the key of married life is purity.

00:12:11.879 --> 00:12:16.651
Purity is the only way you can keep your married life

00:12:16.852 --> 00:12:18.995
absolutely all right.

00:12:19.196 --> 00:12:22.263
Whatever has happened in the past, just forget it.

00:12:22.464 --> 00:12:24.317
Now starts the new life.

00:12:24.518 --> 00:12:30.078
After this, don't hide anything from your wife or from your husband.

00:12:30.838 --> 00:12:33.714
Everything must be told,

00:12:33.915 --> 00:12:36.812
it should be straightforward life,

00:12:37.013 --> 00:12:42.973
absolutely a straightforward life, extremely pure.

00:12:44.414 --> 00:12:47.987
And this purity, everyday practiced

00:12:48.188 --> 00:12:50.728
will be seen very soon in life,

00:12:50.929 --> 00:12:56.042
that marriages always elevate a person.

00:12:56.243 --> 00:12:59.593
But purity is the key of married life.

00:12:59.794 --> 00:13:02.580
And I hope you will remember those words.

00:13:02.781 --> 00:13:06.615
Try to keep your mind pure.

00:13:06.816 --> 00:13:16.139
Do not suspect your wives, nor deceive, vice versa.

00:13:18.417 --> 00:13:23.150
Keep a very straightforward relationship

00:13:23.351 --> 00:13:28.105
and learn how to be that way, your children will learn from you

00:13:28.306 --> 00:13:31.554
and there's no time taken now

00:13:31.755 --> 00:13:36.137
for the whole world to be transformed, once we learn this trust.

00:13:36.465 --> 00:13:38.688
Not in money alone,

00:13:38.889 --> 00:13:44.017
but in every way, a trust, a complete trust.

00:13:44.218 --> 00:13:48.565
As you trust yourself, you must trust the other,

00:13:48.766 --> 00:13:51.766
who is not other anymore.

00:13:52.582 --> 00:13:55.276
So those who have been married before, those who are married,

00:13:55.477 --> 00:13:59.674
who are going to get married, and those who are married today,

00:13:59.875 --> 00:14:03.035
for all of them, I bless you

00:14:03.236 --> 00:14:11.569
with a very deep enjoyment of this understanding,

00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:15.969
the joy of your purity,

00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:21.981
the beauty should flow all your lives, eternally.

00:14:22.182 --> 00:14:24.955
May God bless you all.
