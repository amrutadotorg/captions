00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,580
- [INAUDIBLE]
-  [INAUDIBLE]

2
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:29,680
The purpose of to-night's gathering is for you to have the opportunity, if you wish to

3
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:34,440
to have this energy released

4
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:43,600
to have it pass through these various centers, to enlighten them, to switch them on, if you like,

5
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:52,160
until eventually it will reach the top of your head which in effect is the [UNCLEAR] I talked to you about

6
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:59,320
and from that point you can become here what we call realized

7
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:05,920
people. You have a whole new world opened up to you.

8
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:14,640
It is a very simple process, it requires nothing of you but your own will to [UNCLEAR]

9
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:21,700
Like most evolutionary events it's quite simple.

10
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:28,640
Has to be simple, it has to be something that happens without effort on your part.

11
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:35,640
Just as you became a human-being without effort so this is another step

12
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,220
in your evolutionary course.

13
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:49,120
So, when Shri Mataji has finished Her talk She will offer you this experience.

14
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,600
And I hope you'll get it.

15
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:04,040
[INAUDIBLE]

16
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:12,240
[INAUDIBLE]

17
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:20,240
[INAUDIBLE]

18
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:28,480
[INAUDIBLE]

19
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:36,880
[INAUDIBLE]

20
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:45,140
[INAUDIBLE]

21
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:50,920
[INAUDIBLE]

22
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:02,160
[UNCLEAR - YOU?] would like Me  to stand up and..

23
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:09,320
[UNCLEAR] I'll stand up [UNCLEAR] can't see you so. I will stand up

24
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:20,900
It's all right, it's all right, doesn't matter

25
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,360
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

26
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:39,500
At the very outset we have to know that truth is what it is.

27
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:47,320
We cannot mold it, we cannot organize it and we cannot order it.

28
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:52,240
It exists, has existed and will exist.

29
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:59,440
The truth is very simple and whatever I'm telling you

30
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:05,140
you have to seek it in a very scientific way.

31
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:11,840
Like a scientist has to keep his mind open for any new ideas that come to him

32
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:20,260
and he should treat this as a hypothesis and if it is proved true then you have to accept it in all honesty.

33
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:28,060
Now the truth is that there is a All-Pervading power

34
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:34,980
which is described in all the scriptures - All-Pervading power of love.

35
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:42,900
These people could not have told us lies, they were not liars and they were not interested

36
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:47,160
in doing something which was not for our benevolence.

37
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:54,100
But it has not been proved that such a power - the subtle power - exists.

38
00:04:54,340 --> 00:05:00,800
This power is the power

39
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:09,060
that thinks, that understands, does all the living work -

40
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,600
not only that but it organizes,

41
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:24,460
it puts everything into order, it creates all the nature's circuits

42
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:30,420
and last of all it loves. This power exists

43
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:36,860
but we have never felt it before because at human level we cannot feel it.

44
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,200
So, the second truth is that we're not only our body,

45
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:47,660
our emotions, our ego, our thoughts,

46
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:52,620
our plans but we are the spirit.

47
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,260
And when we become the spirit - means when our attention gets enlightened

48
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:01,660
that the light of the spirit that resides in your heart,

49
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:09,280
then you can feel on your finger-tips this beautiful power which is there,

50
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:14,840
is described by all the sages, Incarnations and prophets.

51
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:21,560
So, this power is to be felt.

52
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:27,580
And if I say so, it is important that at least take it when we are

53
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:35,280
on the very [UNCLEAR] clouds, that you say in modern science [UNCLEAR]

54
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:41,980
Also you may be, beautiful way we should say, that it's the best time for this

55
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:50,160
because people are getting  out of [UNCLEAR - COMPARISON?], out of

56
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:58,280
their ideas about progress. They're thinking, "What is it that we're not so peaceful, why is it we

57
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:06,480
cannot enjoy our life as we should have enjoyed?" So, there's a very big uh.. urge to know the truth.

58
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:11,820
And this is thing, is the pure desire within us that we have to know the truth.

59
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:16,380
Now he's talked to you about Russia, I was really surprised,

60
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:20,800
and the Russian people, I used to think, such suppressed people and all that.

61
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:26,980
In a way they were suppressed very much, I should say, because uh..

62
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:32,280
of, they couldn't talk about politics, they couldn't discuss politics, they couldn't

63
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:40,680
uh.. go for elections and things like that. But there's something good about them - they have no conditionings, quite all right,

64
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:48,420
they have no conditionings of any kind. Now, as far as religions are concerned

65
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:54,940
the people who started the religions were perfectly all right.

66
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:01,340
They were truthful and they were like flowers on the tree of life.

67
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:07,760
One after another they appeared and what all they preached, in the essence

68
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:14,120
they all said the same thing - that you are to be born again, you have to have your Self-realization.

69
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:22,640
But when, human-beings took over from that, they started deviating from the right path.

70
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:30,580
And that's why we find in every religion something that is very mysterious for our mind - we don't understand why

71
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:36,100
this is so. So the essence of all religions can be only understood

72
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:44,200
if you become your own essence and your essence is your spirit - that's the essence of life.

73
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:50,620
And that's what you have to become and that is the last breakthrough for ordinary human-beings.

74
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:57,480
The last breakthrough where you just jump into a new awareness -

75
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:05,580
which is described by Hume, very clearly, that now at the second step or the last step that we have

76
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:08,820
we have to become collectively conscious.

77
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:15,180
We have become, is the point - it's not that we are collectively conscious, we have to become. A human

78
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:19,980
being has to become, that means on his Central Nervous System

79
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:27,880
he has to become collectively conscious and he has to feel that another person on his finger-tips.

80
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:37,160
And when that happens, who is the other because you have feeled everyone within yourself.

81
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:42,020
And if you know how to correct the problems that are within you

82
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:49,340
and without, you solve the problem. And this'll effect the whole emancipation

83
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:57,020
of humanity contained within us because within us lies our glory which we all do not know.

84
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:04,180
We're lost in the ignorance part of ourselves. Like I would say, if there's a television

85
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:11,240
you take it to an Indian village and show them and tell them you can get scenes from Australia and all these

86
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:18,500
places they'll say, " Oh, how can that be, it's just a ordinary box." But when you put to the mains, it works

87
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:23,280
and it shows how fantastic it is.

88
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:30,140
In the same way we are fantastic, we're made for a purpose to enjoy life,

89
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:34,600
to enjoy everything in the purest form.

90
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:41,040
And that purpose has to be served, very easily it is to be managed -

91
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:48,340
as we call it sahaja, means born with you. Sahaja - 'saha' is with - born with you.

92
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:52,860
This is born with you, the grant to be

93
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:56,960
in yoga, means 'union with the Divine'.

94
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:03,000
And this is your birthright - you all have to have it. Everyone has to have it.

95
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:09,720
Some will have it before, some will have later on but gradually so many people will have to get it

96
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,760
like first one, one fish came on the water,

97
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:21,820
and then few more and then few more and then the shoals of same. In the same way it is going to work out.

98
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:28,740
It's working out uh... we are now working it out in forty nations.

99
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:36,620
It works slowly because it's a living process. It's not something plastic that you can create,

100
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:41,880
you cannot be member - you have to  become and for that you can't pay.

101
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:48,360
You can't pay. I mean, like in the Mother Earth if you have to, say, sow something

102
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:52,700
and you want to sprout some seeds - the Mother Earth doesn't understand money.

103
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,480
No use standing on your heads either. It just sprouts by itself. In the same way it acts.

104
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:04,460
You cannot pay for it - this is one principle one must know, that you can't pay for your Self-realization.

105
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:10,020
And that is something, is so much not known to people

106
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:16,000
and I'm sorry to say that many people have come out even from India and from all over

107
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:23,100
and are trying to befool people, take advantage of their simplicity and ignorance and make lot of money.

108
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:28,420
I've been telling since long, that you should shun such people

109
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:35,900
and don't waste money on these nonsensical things. You cannot pay for God, you cannot pay for your Self-realization

110
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:43,540
because Self doesn't understand money - it's a man-made commodity. Self doesn't.

111
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:49,000
And as a result of that, the Kundalini rises, so many things happen.

112
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:55,160
Today I'll tell in you in short, tomorrow I'll explain to you how it works out on more scientific basis.

113
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:58,560
But how it works out, is very interesting

114
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:06,340
that these centers that we have within us, as he must have shown you, seven centers, one is below the Kundalini

115
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,920
and six of them are above the Kundalini.

116
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:19,200
Now, this Kundalini space is a bone called Sacrum, which means sacred - that means the Greeks knew about it

117
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:22,940
that it's a sacred bone containing some sort of a power.

118
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:30,060
When this Kundalini rises, when this power, this residual power within us rises,

119
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:35,440
it integrates all these subtle centers. Now these subtle centers

120
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:41,140
on the physical side also look after our plexuses, on the mental side also they look after them.

121
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:48,420
So as it rises, nourishes them, integrates them and then connects it, connects it up to the mains.

122
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:54,680
So all the time this energy starts flowing up. Now this energy has at least three powers.

123
00:13:54,920 --> 00:14:02,800
First power by which it comforts you. Comforting means your sickness - many incurable diseases can be cured by this.

124
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,860
There are three doctors in Delhi now, have got their M.D. in sahaja yoga for curing uh..

125
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:15,340
uh..diseases like Asthma, like psychosomatic diseases and things like that.

126
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:22,840
And now, it's gone up to America and also Helsinki - of course in Russia they have accepted as,

127
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:30,920
as an independent organization. This [UNCLEAR] organization they call it [UNCLEAR] although we have no organization as such.

128
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:35,260
We cannot be organized as I told you. So,

129
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:43,180
this power of healing, the comfort, comes through the nourishment of these subtle centers within us.

130
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:50,600
And that's how, so many of people, so many people who have suffered from incurable diseases, have been cured

131
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:56,300
with the awakening of the Kundalini. I don't have to do anything, it's your own, it's within yourself.

132
00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:02,040
Only thing, an enlightened candle can enlighten another candle - in the same way it works.

133
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:07,200
Now then, you have another beautiful uh..

134
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:14,340
present from this awakening is that, all your mental problems are solved. So many people who were mentally harassed,

135
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:20,980
who were schizophrenic and all kinds of problems of the mental depressions and all that, they got cured.

136
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:29,160
But we do not say that everybody will be cured, most of them do get cured and gradually they settle down.

137
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:33,100
You'll be surprised, there're many cases of Blood Cancer which have been cured.

138
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:39,860
But that's not the main job of sahaja yoga - is not to cure people otherwise I better go to the hospitals and work it out.

139
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:47,880
But the main job is to awaken the Kundalini, so that you become the spirit and once you become the spirit these things work out gradually.

140
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:54,900
And then you become empowered yourself, that you can raise the Kundalini of others and can deal with them.

141
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:59,540
Then, within us lies our own peace.

142
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:05,860
You must have heard of so many peace foundations and people getting Nobel prizes for peace -

143
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:11,000
they have no peace within themselves. They make peace foundations where they talk about peace.

144
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:15,320
Talking about peace doesn't bring forth any peace at all.

145
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:22,980
You have to be peaceful within and the transformation of a human being is needed for achieving that state of complete peace.

146
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:31,480
And then you become a witness - witness of everything like a drama you see everything - you're not bothered.

147
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:36,040
Just look what is happening outside - you're not disturbed by that.

148
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:43,360
On the contrary you're much better placed to solve the problems because you're out of it and you can see them so clearly and you can solve them.

149
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:49,100
So, it makes you extremely dynamic and then you become enlarged -

150
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:54,860
pure love [UNCLEAR] compassion, extremely compassionate.

151
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58,940
But last of all you become joy.

152
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:04,740
When we become joy it cannot be described because it is only joy, it's absolute.

153
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:12,520
It is not happiness and unhappiness, it is joy and that joy is to be enjoyed.

154
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:20,660
Apart from this uh..you become a very knowledgeable person because this brain of ours

155
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:27,800
is very partly used by us. But when the light of the spirit goes into it, you become extremely knowledgeable

156
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:34,500
and you become very, in a way, very intelligent, I would say - you see the point very clearly,

157
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:41,380
you become very wise and sensible. All these traits are very fantastic to ask because you can't believe it -

158
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:48,160
how can this happen? But it does happen, I must say, it does happen and because it's your own, it's within you.

159
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:53,880
I mean, I'm doing nothing about it, I should say - it just works out because you have not known what you are!

160
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:58,000
Just you have to discover yourself, that's what is sahaja yoga.

161
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:03,760
But we see wonders happening, in London specially, where we have lots of people who are

162
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:10,760
drug addicts, alcoholics, all absolutely uh...drenched into it.

163
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:15,600
And overnight they gave up, overnight they gave up

164
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:21,380
that habit of alcoholism and drug and the whole thing is so surprising

165
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:25,240
how they suddenly became such beautiful people!

166
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:32,860
So sensible, so powerful that no habit can dominate them. All these things are there

167
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:37,640
just for you and you have to enjoy that, it's all your own.

168
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:44,460
Now, because today is the first day, I would like to have some questions from you but relevant to the subject, would be better

169
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:50,060
because I'm here for nothing. I don't want any votes or any money from you - nothing of the kind.

170
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:56,720
I'm just come here to tell you what you have and to enjoy it, so it's better to ask questions which are relevant.

171
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Of course discussions and all that are not going to lead you there, talking too much is not going to lead you there because it is beyond

172
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:10,640
mental capacity of human beings. You have to go beyond, you have to become that Absolute Truth -

173
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:15,020
that All-Pervading Truth.

174
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:23,520
And for that you cannot discuss it or argue it out but if you have any problems, please ask Me - I'll be very, very

175
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:27,540
true to tell you about it. Thank you very much.

176
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:37,500
[INAUDIBLE]

177
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:50,860
[UNCLEAR] can we just asking questions now or  [UNCLEAR]

178
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,760
- What's she saying, I can't hear?
- Yes, please do.
- All right.

179
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:01,880
[UNCLEAR] I want to ask you, sometimes I get pain in the [UNCLEAR] Kundalini wants to come up

180
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:07,060
I get pardoned because I've heard [UNCLEAR] come up too fast

181
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:11,300
[UNCLEAR N INAUDIBLE - CAN YOU FIND OUT?] if that's true or

182
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:17,640
- She said sometimes she feels that her Kundalini is going to rise but she gets frightened because she's been told [UNCLEAR]
-

183
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:22,760
- Ah, it's correct, naturally - I know, I know, I'll talk about that
- Yeah.

184
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:29,280
Uh.. is a fact, you see, that people have really frightened people against, against Kundalini.

185
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:37,220
I know it's a very negative attitude of people to stop people from getting their Self-realization.

186
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,520
You see, She's your mother

187
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:49,200
and when you were born your mother took over all the trouble, all the trouble. In the same way, She is

188
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:56,660
your individual mother and She knows - like a tape recorder She's taped everything within Herself what you have been and what

189
00:20:56,860 --> 00:21:04,260
has been happening to you and She's so beautiful, She rises up so sweetly, without any problem -

190
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:08,720
I mean, I've seen thousands of people, thousands of them all over the world.

191
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:12,760
Nobody got into any trouble, on the contrary everybody became very beautiful.

192
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:18,860
O course you do feel little heat if it, there's a little bit of problem or some sort of problem or a cancer

193
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:23,140
patient sometimes feel the heat on the hands - that's all, not much.

194
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:31,880
But why, why the [UNCLEAR] to Hatha yoga and [INAUDIBLE]

195
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:39,420
why do they take so long uh.. in their training and why do they make sure that the Kundalini comes up

196
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:44,060
slowly and not too fast - why is that necessary for them?

197
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:49,100
- With sahaja yogies, you mean sahaja yogies?
- [INAUDIBLE] Hatha yoga and

198
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:57,500
Haan, haan, haan, you see, [UNCLEAR] I was secured. You see, Hatha yoga was established

199
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:04,140
- thousands of years back by Patanjali.
- Patanjali? Oh!
- By Patanjali, all right?

200
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,600
And Patanjali has talked about Ashtagarkar - eight parts of [UNCLEAR].

201
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:16,380
In those days the life was very different and in India that time we had uh..

202
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:24,400
uh.. ashramas - means people lived in four styles. The first style was called Brahmacharya - celibate life -

203
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:30,480
they lived in the ashramas and where they used to select very few people who could get their Self-realization.

204
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:35,940
The rest of them were taught how to improve your health, this , that and slowly, slowly

205
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:45,800
I mean, we should say that, on the tree of life there were hardly one or two flowers

206
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:50,600
so they couldn't make up fruits but today it's a blossom time.

207
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:58,140
- Oh, so You're saying [UNCLEAR] the Kundalini come up I'm not going to go inside
- Oh, of course [LAUGHTER]

208
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:05,360
He said it. [SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS]. You don't have to worry all about. You see, this is a gentle

209
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:10,200
[UNCLEAR - PAGE?] all right and Kundalini has perhaps become the gentle as well,

210
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:17,860
[UNCLEAR] the tree of civilization has grown so big, all right, and the roots

211
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:23,620
are also developing. If you don't feel your roots, the civilization will disappear.

212
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:30,120
So, there's an equal and opposite growth and that's why it works out very fast.

213
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:34,320
Of course I must say, that I did some work on that also

214
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:42,820
to find out the permutations and combinations why human beings take so much time to get realization - now they don't.

215
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:50,020
But you have to establish yourself. First the Kundalini will rise, build our breakthrough, you might feel the cool breeze,

216
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:56,600
immediately you'll feel on your hands, finger-tips will feel it, coming out of your head but

217
00:23:56,860 --> 00:24:03,800
after some time you have to allow it to grow.

218
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:10,080
Like a seed which is sprouted has to grow into a plant and then into a tree - it's like that.

219
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:14,100
Takes hardly a month, at the most - you can become a master of it.

220
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:19,020
Sounds quite fantastic, isn't it?

221
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:27,420
- Mother, is it safe to give realization to children?
- Oh absolutely, they are the best.

222
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:35,340
Don't have to do much about them, they just get it automatically - they are the sweetest things, don't you think so?

223
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:43,120
And these days the so many children are born, are realized souls, I'm surprised! So many children are realized souls, we don't understand them.

224
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:48,980
And also the people who get married in sahaja yoga, if they're both are sahaja yogies,

225
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,640
then they get all realized souls born to them. I think there are many

226
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:59,300
realized souls waiting to be born - they want to see good parents, that's all.

227
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:11,540
It has been said that you have to be spiritually ready before you can awaken the Kundalini

228
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:19,480
- otherwise you won't be able to control it.
- You see, I would say that your Kundalini knows everything about you,

229
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:26,860
and She knows everything and She judges you - you don't have to worry about that point. She is the surgeon

230
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:31,840
and She knows what is to be done. So you don't have to worry and you don't have to certify yourself.

231
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:38,280
Only thing is, that you must know that you must have committed some mistakes, so it's all right, you're a human being, you're not God.

232
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:46,780
If you have made mistakes, doesn't matter, don't feel guilty. I mean this is another thing in the Western mind that we should feel guilty for everything. You see,

233
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:53,860
even if I put the thing like this, I should say sorry and sorry and sorry. There's nothing to be sorry about [LAUGHTER]

234
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:59,780
You see, so there are so many norms we have made uh to make us [UNCLEAR] -

235
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:05,860
there's nothing to feel guilty at all, nothing to feel guilty. On the contrary you have to be very confident about yourself.

236
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:14,760
You are a human being an epitome - epitomy of the evolution - the top-most people.

237
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:23,900
All these side issues people have started because they don't know how to raise the Kundalini, I think.

238
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:30,360
Like supposing, if I had to plug this, If I don't know any plug [UNCLEAR], you see, I know where to do it.

239
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:36,780
But supposing he doesn't know anything, he'll go around the whole world and touch something and say that Kundalini awakening is horrid.

240
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:40,680
They have to know it, that's all.

241
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:48,960
- I would say, I would say that we are totally Divine, each person
- Of course.

242
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:56,400
But we, but the scientists and religion, as such, has always told us about sinners.

243
00:26:56,780 --> 00:27:02,540
- That's all wrong
- That's [UNCLEAR]
- Is all wrong. You see, this is how they start telling everybody, "You are sinners."

244
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:10,060
So that you give lot of money to them so that they can wipe out your sins, sins. To be very frank, it's all wrong.

245
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:18,180
And even in Christianity I've seen that so many things have gone wrong, of course Hinduism has the same problem, everybody

246
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:22,620
thinks they're sinners and they're committing sins here and there.

247
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:28,700
But recently there's a nice discovery about a book uh.. they have written

248
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:35,040
when Thomas, the disciple of Christ was coming to Italy, he passed through Egypt and he wrote

249
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:40,260
beautiful treatise about Christ and he said that, "You don't have to feel

250
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:47,920
uh..unhappy, don't have to suffer - Christ has suffered for you, now you don't suffer. You're not going to suffer more than He has suffered."

251
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:56,240
And he's talked, told about experiences spontaneity and everything he's talked about. But as soon as that was published, I think

252
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:01,440
the Christians got fright.., got worried about it. That's a fact.

253
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:06,620
That's a fact because this idea of suffering has come from where, I don't know

254
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:11,920
maybe Mr. Paul or somebody has introduced it, I just don't know [LAUGHTER]

255
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:18,820
and he, this gentleman also calls it Pauling Christianity because he suffered from Epilepsy so might have.

256
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:24,900
And sometimes it's just surprising, like if you go to the Sistine Chapel in Rome, you see the,

257
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:32,140
whole thing is nothing but Kundalini and this Last Judgment where the Kundalini rises and Christ residing there at the Agnya chakra.

258
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:40,260
He's such a hefty, tall gentleman - that's what He should be but down below on the table there's one skeleton kept

259
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:46,840
like this, of Christ, you see - I say, with that skeleton could He have carried that horrible cross?

260
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:53,140
So this is how they want to depict that this is wrong and same thing in every religion. I mean, it's nothing new.

261
00:28:53,360 --> 00:29:01,200
Everybody must suffer. Why should you suffer for God? He is God Almighty, He is nothing but love.

262
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:08,840
No father wants you to suffer - then He's the Father of all the fathers. All the love you have of a father comes from that source,

263
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:17,020
how can He ask you to suffer? I mean, reasonably you just see the point. No, there's no need at all.

264
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:27,380
[UNCLEAR N INAUDIBLE] Divine life.

265
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:32,340
- What's she saying?
-  [INAUDIBLE]

266
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:37,200
- Hmm. What's she saying?
- Saying, in the Gospel of Thomas

267
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:45,180
- Annh?
- There is something in the Gospel of Thomas about light, saying Divine light [UNCLEAR N INAUDIBLE]

268
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:52,920
Yeah, correct. Yes, Thomas has said that, no doubt, and that's a very fact that you're the light

269
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:59,300
and light inside but if you see the light then you're not the light. If I see this light, that means I'm not that light.

270
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:05,040
So, you don't have to see the light. Like Paul saw some light so he was not the light himself.

271
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:15,660
And another idea too [UNCLEAR] and she said

272
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:23,260
- [UNCLEAR]
- What's she saying?
- [UNCLEAR]

273
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:31,560
- [INAUDIBLE]
- Who? Haan.
-  [INAUDIBLE]

274
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:38,480
[INAUDIBLE]

275
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:46,400
Is correct, you see, what he said is true but we have to get out of the opposites. We have two opposites about which I'll tell you tomorrow.

276
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:52,340
Now, I went and addressed the uh..Humians in New York and

277
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:59,960
I had not read him before much but I opened the book and saw the one mistake in his understanding about human beings was

278
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:04,920
that he had put uh.. his mind uh.. like

279
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:12,720
the Subconscious, and the Collective Subconscious and then the Subconscious, then the uh..Conscious mind and then the

280
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:20,320
Supra-conscious mind like that - into layers and layers like this, horizontal - that was  a mistake.

281
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:28,780
It lies parallel and the central path is left open to us. After all He's a Creator

282
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:36,740
and a great organizer. Supposing you have to go to the aeroplane and you're rushing about, you have to pass through

283
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:42,900
all the luggage, jumping over everything - how will you reach there? He's a great organizer

284
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:51,060
so it is not horizontal, it is parallel. That's the only mistake he committed perhaps because he got his realization quite late in life

285
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:56,600
and there was no one to tell him about it but that you don't have to go to Subconscious - no.

286
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:03,820
I'll tell you tomorrow where lies the Subconscious and where lies the Collective Subconscious and the Supra-conscious and the Collective Supra-conscious.

287
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:11,240
All right? We have many Humians with us, I must say, in sahaja yoga.

288
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:19,560
Can I ask you, can I ask you this truth that you need to have a master to touch your [UNCLEAR]

289
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:26,220
- [UNCLEAR]
- What?
- [UNCLEAR]

290
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:32,540
[UNCLEAR] dangerous to do without a master.

291
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:40,980
- Oh, Tantrik yoga is the worst of all - in any way whether you have a master or no master.
- For what reason?

292
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:45,360
For one reason that they don't know anything about the mechanism.

293
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:50,860
They are money makers, that's all. It's all money oriented.

294
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:58,880
- [UNCLEAR]
- Tantrik is a money maker?
- Annh?
- Tantrik, tantrik is a money maker?

295
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:06,860
- Yeah, of course, they are. They
- [UNCLEAR]
- [UNCLEAR] What's she saying?

296
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:12,880
- [UNCLEAR] ancient countries money makers.
- I'm not talking about

297
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:19,140
- She's not talking about
- You see, tantra means, I'll tell you, explain to you, very clearly. Tantra means the mechanism.

298
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:25,500
And the mechanism who knows are not the tantrikas but the people who are yogies.

299
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:34,480
And the tantrikas are just the opposite of it, just opposite. Say, they do something wrong

300
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:42,480
to spoil your passage, what we call the Sushumna

301
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,820
and you are under their control because they use all kinds of witchcraft, this , that.

302
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:51,780
These are the tantrikas. They were not tantrikas, they were yogies.

303
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:57,680
No, no, there are two sides of tantriks. You're talking about the dark side, there's a, there's a light side as well.

304
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:02,540
So far, I've not known any, I must say, but the only the yogies

305
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:09,440
they may, they only people who knew the tantra were the yogies or the great masters

306
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:16,020
but none of them, those who call themselves tantrikas came in India this process in the sixth century -

307
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:23,380
they were horrid people, [UNCLEAR - JUST?] horrid. They started in sixth century right from Konark

308
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:30,120
up to uh.., we can say, Panna and all that - you must have seen all these places yourself, if you go to India -

309
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:38,120
horrible thing and they use sex as the way to get realization. How can it be? You see now, the last center is here,

310
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:44,460
the red one, all right, is below the Kundalini and this is the one which looks after your pelvic plexus,

311
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:50,240
which is looking after your all excretion, sex inclusive -

312
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:55,220
sex has nothing to do - at that time you become like a child when the Kundalini is rising.

313
00:34:55,780 --> 00:35:02,800
Your innocence comes back. Innocence is never lost in human beings, never lost - it is covered

314
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:10,240
like a cloud but never lost. So, all these tantrikas were using the sex energy or some sort of a nonsensical thing like that.

315
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:17,760
So they started with the sixth century in India and because of the some of the licentious kings we had, it started growing now.

316
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:24,400
- They were all nonsensical
- Oh.. I'm sorry but it's not without [UNCLEAR - Praise?]
- But you see, have you, you must see the result.

317
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:31,960
Proof of the pudding is in the eating of it, all right? You should see the result of these tantrikas what they have created. They have created nothing.

318
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:38,500
- because You're from India so You probably not have known [UNCLEAR]
- Oh, they just talk. I haven't seen anybody doing anything good anywhere.

319
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:45,200
These tantrikas these days are settled in Delhi looking after our politicians teaching them other nonsensical things.

320
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:50,760
- [INAUDIBLE]
- They're not, and you see yogi is not interested in all money making business.

321
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:59,040
-Yes, madam?
- If someone has [UNCLEAR] of asthma, do you concentrate on one certain chakra or

322
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:07,180
- [UNCLEAR] area or do you have [UNCLEAR]
-  What she's saying?

323
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:15,040
- I'm sorry, you know, I can't understand the Australian English, sometimes [LAUGHTER]

324
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:20,500
- I'll try, after sometimes I'll get used to, I'll get used to, I'm sorry.
- If you suffer from Asthma [UNCLEAR]

325
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:25,740
do you concentrate on one particular chakra or you have to work on all of them.

326
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:32,340
No, only on two chakras you have to work it out. And only, only two chakras, it works out.

327
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:40,060
On this one, is the Right Vishudhdhi we call it and also the Right, uh..Right heart - only two chakras it works out.

328
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:47,000
Sometimes of course you might have a left Vishudhdhi - but this, it's not difficult to work it out,  Asthma, it's not difficult.

329
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:54,060
- So, what do you concentrate, on the heart one
- No, no, no, no not on the heart, there's a right heart we call it, right heart

330
00:36:54,260 --> 00:37:01,860
- All right
- Right heart, right heart and this Vishudhdhi on the right side - it's mostly right sided thing. It comes from liver,

331
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:05,920
take it from Me. Haan.

332
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:16,040
Excuse me, Yoga is called union with this universal spirit of God or whatever You call it

333
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:23,940
- where is [UNCLEAR] have this union, where is He?
- Yoga is union with the power

334
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:32,140
- the All-Pervading power of, where is it?
- It's everywhere. It's in a subtle form everywhere, madam, everywhere.

335
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:37,700
- Including me and You?
- Beg your pardon.
- Including all us?

336
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:44,620
Of course, it is all over. It's the Holy Ghost, as they call it. Is the power of the Holy Ghost

337
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:49,420
and the reflection of the Holy Ghost is the Kundalini. And what is the Holy Ghost?

338
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:53,720
It's a mystery but I'll tell you what is the Holy Ghost is.

339
00:37:54,300 --> 00:38:00,960
See, God Almighty has a son is out of [UNCLEAR] behind you.

340
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:07,500
So the Primordial Mother is the Holy Ghost - we call it Adishakti in Indian language.

341
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:12,680
And the reflection of this Adishakti is the Kundalini.

342
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:18,420
You will understand everything. See in one lecture you cannot understand everything,

343
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:24,540
- No
- you see.
- I understand all this powerful and He can be experienced everywhere

344
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:30,700
but if He's in You and me [UNCLEAR] can't understand [UNCLEAR] You and me.

345
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:38,580
You see, now the connection of this thing is within itself, all right? But it is to be connected, that's all.

346
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:47,640
There is electricity in it but it is to be connected. That's the only part missing.

347
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:57,220
It's nice we have some things like this to give you analogies [LAUGHTER]. Modern times are very helpful that way, isn't it?

348
00:38:57,540 --> 00:39:00,560
Can I have some water, please?

349
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:08,960
- Yes, madam?
- I have a question about nutrition. Is it better to live vegetarian, does meat hurt your system?

350
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:16,640
You see, in sahaja yoga we, we just consider the personality of a person, a kind of a person he is.

351
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:26,840
Of course the meat of the animals which are bigger than us are injurious to the teeth and all that.

352
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:34,720
But supposing, somebody is a vegetarian and uh.. he is, he needs proteins

353
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:42,960
so he has to take proteins and if somebody needs uh..  less proteins he has to take carbohydrates.

354
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:49,580
So it is more sort of understanding of a personality. Uh.. We, we do not taboo anything like that

355
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:55,280
because it's a wrong idea that vegetarianam takes you to God, it's very wrong.

356
00:39:55,460 --> 00:40:01,620
In India, you will find that the worse people are vegetarians, horrible people. [LAUGHTER] They're so cruel,

357
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:07,400
I'll give you an example, Hitler was a vegetarian, what do you say to that? Strict vegetarian.

358
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:16,280
You see, because you don't have sufficient muscles to control your anger also sometimes. So it's not necessary you have to be vegetarian.

359
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:24,520
It has nothing to do with food but with the prakriti, as you call the nature of a person - what sort of a nature you have and what needs nourishment and looking after.

360
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:30,040
If the whole world turns to vegetarians, we don't have to kill any animals.

361
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:38,280
No, I mean, what's the use of having too many animals also, you can't give them realization, can you? [LAUGHTER]

362
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:45,140
And there are many countries where no vegetable grows, for example, Japanese, specially Greenland people. They said,

363
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:52,060
"What sin have we committed that we have no vegetables here." So, after all, God must have been fair to everyone.

364
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:59,420
But of course, in Australia people eat too much meat, so if they take to vegetarianism a little bit, is a good idea -

365
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:02,920
just to balance it out, that's all.

366
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:12,040
[UNCLEAR] You told the story about your grand daughter before [UNCLEAR]

367
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:18,360
story regarding your grand daughter and something funny she said to You, your daughter

368
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:23,760
- What's it?
-  [UNCLEAR] about the Elephant god. I mean, we could hear [UNCLEAR]

369
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:30,680
[UNCLEAR] your grand daughter said something to You

370
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:34,100
about the, about Ganesha.

371
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:41,320
I don't know which one you're say.. I must have given at least 3000, 4000 lectures in only English language.

372
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:46,780
So, I don't know which one you're saying but if you meet Me I, if you'll explain to Me, I'll let you know about it.

373
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:51,680
I've been to [UNCLEAR]

374
00:41:52,340 --> 00:42:00,340
- About what?
- [UNCLEAR]
- There was a student [UNCLEAR]

375
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:08,700
- [UNCLEAR]
- [INAUDIBLE] and the two of them sat down organizing, it was like a tent for her

376
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:16,600
and she, she would come out. Then she called My daughter. She said, "Mummy come and see my house."

377
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:23,580
My daughter is very tall, you see. Somehow or the other she managed to get inside. But the

378
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:30,820
when she got inside so My grand daughter was there, she said, "How do you like my house?"

379
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:37,440
She said, "Very nice!" So, she said, "What do you have for me to eat?"

380
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:42,680
She said, "Mummy, when you go to somebody's house, you don't ask such funny questions." [LAUGHTER]

381
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:48,380
So, My daughter, you see, couldn't help laughing. She started laughing, the whole [UNCLEAR] house was broken.

382
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:56,720
So she came to Me and she said, "Grandma, You have given no good training to Your daughters." She was very young, she was hardly four years or so.

383
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:04,300
"You have given no good training to Your daughters, she came and broke all my house and I did so much for this."

384
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:09,900
But this is just the innocence of a child and said so sweetly.

385
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:19,500
Yeah, you see, the children, you see uh.. children have very strong Mooladhara and they're so innocent

386
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:27,020
and whatever they say innocently, is so wise, so beautiful. Uh.. that you see, there was a book

387
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:34,760
'Lady who had An Idea'. She wrote about what children have to say about politics and things and the book was sold overnight.

388
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:39,840
All the copies were sold out. So, I mean, it's so sweet to listen to them.

389
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:45,300
The best company is that of children.

390
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:57,860
[INAUDIBLE]

391
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:07,660
- [INAUDIBLE] sahaja yoga [INAUDIBLE]
- Sahaja, yes, of course.

392
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:15,720
Of course. Sahaja means spontaneous. Because it's a living process, it can only happen spontaneous.

393
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:21,380
There's no need to do all other uh.. acrobats, no need.

394
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:27,840
- INAUDIBLE]
- Just to do that
- [INAUDIBLE]

395
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:35,940
Annh, you should. You see, it's all right but the one that is pleasure is all temporary, isn't it? You must achieve joy.

396
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:42,860
Pleasure is not permanent, it's just temporary. You must [UNCLEAR] of joy.

397
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:52,040
Pleasure seeking people, I have seen, become bored very soon. Better achieve your joy.

398
00:44:53,500 --> 00:45:01,120
- [INAUDIBLE]
- Beg your pardon.
- Did You have joy all day long [INAUDIBLE]
- [ INAUDIBLE]

399
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:10,700
- You can have joy all day long after doing yoga.
- Yeah, of course, you are joy.

400
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:18,640
You become joy. Yes, of course, but not the yoga of this

401
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:22,360
standing on your heads. [LAUGHTER]

402
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:28,960
While on the contrary, if you do only the physical side of yoga, you might become a very dry person,

403
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:35,320
very dry, because right side attack - I'll tell you tomorrow and men can get divorce.

404
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:40,280
All kinds of things can happen to people who are right-sided. They can be very hot-tempered.

405
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:46,500
We have certain people who are doing Hatha yoga and

406
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:54,800
you must meet them with the barge poles, very dangerous [INAUDIBLE]. You can't ask them any questions, you see, they just come on you.

407
00:45:56,600 --> 00:46:03,980
Can I ask why the right side, in what side of the brain is supposed to be creativity and left side is supposed to be rational side?

408
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:09,240
- [INAUDIBLE]
- What's she saying?

409
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:14,380
She's saying the right side of the brain is supposed to be the creativity

410
00:46:14,620 --> 00:46:20,360
and the left side of the brain is supposed to be the rationality [INAUDIBLE]

411
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:28,500
That I'll tell you tomorrow - it's correct, correct. You have reached the right point, yes, because they cross over, I'll show you, here you can see, see they cross over

412
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:33,060
The yellow line crosses over the other side and this side

413
00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:40,220
but when we say right sided, we mean the yellow ones who suffer from biliousness.

414
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:47,820
They have too much bile in them that's why we have shown you the yellow one - is the Sun line

415
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:56,020
and the left side is the Moon line. I'll tell you all about it tomorrow, all right? But should we have realization, now?

416
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:59,220
Yes, Mother. [INAUDIBLE]

417
00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:06,240
- [INAUDIBLE]
- Pardon?
- [INAUDIBLE]

418
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:13,360
- What he said?
- [INAUDIBLE] Christianity.

419
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:20,240
Oh, I've, I've very [UNCLEAR -CULMINATION?]  for Christ. Christ was so great - without Him we can't work out sahaja yoga.

420
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:25,820
But Christianity [UNCLEAR] better, that's we cannot -

421
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:32,000
we better watch out yourself, I mean, the way it is, I can't understand, really.

422
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:45,240
Can't say. Whether it is Christianity or any religion, any, say Islam, anything

423
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:50,980
say, it's all money-making things, just money-making

424
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:58,180
[UNCLEAR -BIT OF A?] social money-making stuffs. The best part of it - you may follow any religion whatsoever -

425
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:06,300
you may be a Hindu, Muslim, Christian, whatever it is, Jew, anyone - anybody can commit any, any sin.

426
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:14,520
Can murder anyone, I mean, no body is bound. The religion is not within - it's not innate, it's all outside.

427
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:22,960
But once you are in yoga, it's built-in - that's why, all the saints and all the prophets -

428
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:28,600
the real saints and the prophets and the masters, they never did anything that was wrong.

429
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:41,440
That must happen within us - that's the real transformation.

430
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:53,400
So, no use having any attitude about it - better seek the truth about it.

431
00:48:53,640 --> 00:49:00,780
Whatever attitude we have, is a mental projection, that's all. Is a whichever way you are made, you see that

432
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:05,160
Christians think they're the best, Hindus think they're the best, everybody thinks they're the best

433
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:09,720
and if you want to locate this, it's rather difficult to see anything good about it.

434
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:15,980
So, there's something wrong - it's all saying for being self-certified.

435
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:21,840
It's better to know the self, that's what everybody has said it.

436
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:29,060
Even Mohammad sahab has said it so clearly - on the contrary, I would say,  He has said something so clearly that you can

437
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:34,860
feel the cool breeze and that your hands will speak

438
00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:38,940
against your will, you witness against , will tell you what's wrong with you.

439
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:43,940
I mean, there's so much they've said. Not only that but

440
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:49,680
a complete [UNCLEAR] but Muslims have closed that part that they don't want to hear.

441
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:07,380
So, the artificially given uh..baptism is no great, real thing, it has to be actualized.

442
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:13,060
It has to be actualized, it has to happen.

443
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:18,980
Then we don't have to go to church - church is within ourselves.

444
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:25,720
So, what do you say now, should we have?

445
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:34,560
Now, there's one thing at the very outset, you cannot force it on anyone.

446
00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:43,420
Because when you have to achieve ultimate freedom, your freedom has to be respected.

447
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:50,020
So, I cannot force on you. If you want to have your realization really, then only it will work out.

448
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:56,860
So, those who want to have their realization, should be there, otherwise no use, I'll be wasting My energy on them.

449
00:50:57,140 --> 00:51:04,660
So, you have to be decide for it first of all, secondly as I've told you before and again I request you

450
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:09,680
that  forget the past, forget the past

451
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:15,380
forgive yourself completely and know that you are all capable of becoming

452
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:25,000
very highly Self-realized people - all of you are, so, don't find faults with you, don't feel guilty,

453
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:32,640
have confidence. At any age, whatever may be your [UNCLEAR], maybe your [UNCLEAR - NATURE?] -

454
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:38,100
it's all going to work out. So, have confidence in yourself

455
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:41,820
and not to feel guilty at all.

456
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:48,940
These are the two conditions.

457
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:59,680
So, the first humble request is that we have to take out the shoes because the Mother Earth is going to help us.

458
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:15,480
- [INAUDIBLE]
- Talking, talking.

459
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:35,820
Now, take out your shoes just uh.. and put the feet on the Mother Earth - need not take out the socks, it's all right.

460
00:52:40,140 --> 00:52:43,200
What's it?

461
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:47,900
- [INAUDIBLE]
- What happened?

462
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:52,760
[INAUDIBLE]

463
00:52:54,220 --> 00:53:01,980
- [MIXED VOICES]
- It's all right. All right, doesn't matter, doesn't matter.

464
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:08,260
It's all right, doesn't matter. It's all right, it's all right, sit comfortably. You have to be comfortable, it's all right.

465
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:15,560
It's all right, you have to sit comfortably and you have to

466
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:23,560
not to bend too much, not to stretch yourself but comfortably in a straight way.

467
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:29,720
Now, today I want to tell you, also how you can raise you own Kundalini

468
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:35,740
and how we work it out. It's very simple and we'll get somebody to tell you that. [UNCLEAR - CAN COME?]

469
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:44,820
It's very simple, so, first of all we'll show you - keep your eyes open and then you have to close your eyes

470
00:53:45,020 --> 00:53:49,520
because the attention has to go inside. But first he'll tell you, we'll tell you how to do.

471
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:55,080
That the, tomorrow you'll know that the left-side represents our desires

472
00:53:56,800 --> 00:54:02,620
so you put your left hand towards Me like this on your lap, need not be like that

473
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:09,960
but could be on your lap itself, and the right hand is to be used for nourishing your own centers.

474
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:19,640
First of all you have to put your hand on your heart. If you have any thing in the pockets better to remove them little bit

475
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:28,060
so that there's no pressure. In the heart resides the spirit, that's why we first put our hand to our heart.

476
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:36,800
We work only on the left side with our right hand - all the time the left hand being towards Me like that.

477
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:43,580
All right. Now, from the heart you move your right hand

478
00:54:44,340 --> 00:54:51,380
on the left hand side, in the upper portion of your abdomen, here, the left side, press it hard.

479
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:59,140
Now, this is the center of your mastery, what we call as guru principle - that you become a master.

480
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:07,540
Then, you have to take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen, on the left hand side - press it hard.

481
00:55:09,060 --> 00:55:17,260
This is the center of pure knowledge. Knowledge doesn't mean book knowledge or mental knowledge

482
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:22,700
but knowledge that you feel on your Central Nervous System that is

483
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:31,100
uh.. the early Christians used to call it as Gnostics - those who knew it on their Central Nervous system. Even

484
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:36,300
Vedas come from the word vid - means to know on your Central Nervous System.

485
00:55:38,780 --> 00:55:45,780
And in the Buddhism they call it a bodha - bodh means also the same thing - you have to know it on your Central Nervous System.

486
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:49,900
So, this is the pure knowledge, center for the pure knowledge.

487
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:56,380
Then we go back on to the uh.. left hand side

488
00:55:56,680 --> 00:56:03,520
of our abdomen, the upper portion, press it hard there, then to the heart again.

489
00:56:04,460 --> 00:56:12,140
Then we move our right hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder.

490
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:18,500
Now, this is the center which is mostly catching because people feel guilty.

491
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:27,000
It's a very dangerous one, gives you spondylitis or it gives you also angina. Disease of angina comes from the

492
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:34,100
clogging of this center - is called as the Left Vishudhdhi, as we call it. Then, you have to turn your head to your right -

493
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:40,420
do it better because you can push back your hand a little, push your - that's all.

494
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:48,500
Then you have to take your right hand on top of your forehead across, like this, and put down your head.

495
00:56:51,780 --> 00:56:57,800
This is the center where you have to forgive - forgive everyone.

496
00:56:58,360 --> 00:57:05,760
Now, it's easy to say that. Some people think that's difficult to do it but whether you forgive or you don't forgive

497
00:57:06,380 --> 00:57:12,100
you don't do anything - it's a myth. So but, if you say that,

498
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:20,020
"I forgive everyone," then you get out of the clutches of wrong people, mentally.

499
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:28,380
Now, take back your hand on the back side of your head and slowly push back your head towards the sky,

500
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:34,960
like this - this is the center where you have to ask for forgiveness from the Divine

501
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:42,380
without feeling guilty - that is the first condition, the foremost condition - is not to count your mistakes, your past and

502
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:47,880
whatever you think you have done wrong. So, without feeling guilty, you have to ask for forgiveness.

503
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:55,360
Then, you have to stretch your hand fully and the center of your palm is to be placed

504
00:57:55,580 --> 00:58:01,400
on the fontanel bone area, which was a soft bone in your childhood, here.

505
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:08,700
Now, here it is important to understand, push back your fingers completely, push them back and

506
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:14,860
put a pressure. Now, bend down your head, press it hard

507
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:19,400
and move your scalp slowly, clockwise, seven times.

508
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:26,320
Slowly, push back your fingers.

509
00:58:26,540 --> 00:58:32,620
Pressure should be on the scalp movement, not that your hand is moving but the scalp more.

510
00:58:36,660 --> 00:58:43,820
That's all, one has to do. But still I think, you didn't push back your fingers so next time you'll remember.

511
00:58:43,980 --> 00:58:50,280
Now, you have to close your eyes. You can take out your spectacles also, it helps eyesight, please.

512
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:57,940
Now, please don't open your eyes till I tell you, please don't open, till then. You have to close your eyes,

513
00:58:58,180 --> 00:59:05,100
put your feet on the ground, as much as you can touch and

514
00:59:05,380 --> 00:59:12,560
put your left hand towards Me.and right hand on your heart.

515
00:59:14,140 --> 00:59:21,400
Here, you have to ask Me a question because it's like a Divine computer that works

516
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:27,800
and when you become the Divine computer, you'll work the same way. So, you ask a first question to Me -

517
00:59:28,020 --> 00:59:33,060
you can call Me, Shri Mataji or you can call Me, Mother - whatever you think it proper.

518
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:40,920
[UNCLEAR - THAT?] "Mother, am I the spirit?" Ask this question in your heart

519
00:59:41,660 --> 00:59:47,180
three times. "Mother, am I the spirit?" Have faith in yourself, have full confidence in yourself.

520
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:51,260
You ask yourself, "Mother, am I the spirit?"

521
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:57,740
Keep your eyes shut, don't open them.

522
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:08,520
Now, if you are the spirit, you are your master because your spirit is your guide.

523
01:00:08,740 --> 01:00:15,700
So now, put down your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side and press it hard,

524
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:22,240
keeping the left hand towards Me, here you ask another very important question three times,

525
01:00:22,540 --> 01:00:30,240
"Mother, am I my own master? Mother, am I my own guru?" - Ask this question three times.

526
01:00:51,660 --> 01:00:59,420
As I've already told you that I respect your freedom and I cannot force it on you -

527
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:06,540
not even the pure knowledge. So now, you have to ask for pure knowledge.

528
01:01:06,740 --> 01:01:11,260
Put down your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen, press it hard.

529
01:01:14,700 --> 01:01:23,760
And now, you have to say, "Mother, please give Me pure, pure knowledge." In the glory of your own freedom, you have to ask Me,

530
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:29,520
"Mother, please give me pure knowledge." This you have to say six times

531
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:36,260
because this center has got six petals, so you have to say it six times.

532
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:43,040
"Mother, please give me pure knowledge." In Sanskrit called as Shudh Vidya.

533
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:14,820
As soon as you say that, the Kundalini starts rising. So now,

534
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:21,940
we have to nourish the higher centers so that Her movement becomes easier.

535
01:02:22,140 --> 01:02:28,900
So now, please raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen, on the left hand side and press it hard.

536
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:41,120
To open this center, with full confidence, you have to say ten times, with full confidence in yourself,

537
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:47,060
"Mother, I am my own master." Please say it ten times.

538
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:54,860
"Mother, I am my own master." Please say it ten times, asserting.

539
01:03:00,780 --> 01:03:05,380
This is very good for people who have been to wrong masters.

540
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:22,320
The greatest truth about yourself is that, you are not this body,

541
01:03:22,520 --> 01:03:26,200
you are not this mind,

542
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:32,920
you are not this ego, you are not this, these emotions, your thought, your work -

543
01:03:33,140 --> 01:03:38,840
you are the spirit. So now, raise your right hand on your heart

544
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:50,120
and now with full confidence say, you have to say twelve times, "Mother, I am the spirit."

545
01:03:51,380 --> 01:03:57,780
Put it on your heart, the right hand and say with full confidence

546
01:03:58,700 --> 01:04:04,300
twelve times, "Mother, I am the pure spirit."

547
01:04:25,460 --> 01:04:30,760
Now, one has to understand

548
01:04:31,020 --> 01:04:37,520
that Divine power, which is All-pervading, is the power

549
01:04:40,660 --> 01:04:48,760
that is the ocean of bliss and knowledge, is the ocean

550
01:04:49,660 --> 01:04:57,520
of joy but above all it is the ocean of forgiveness.

551
01:04:57,840 --> 01:05:01,740
and you cannot do anything that it cannot forgive.

552
01:05:02,420 --> 01:05:09,100
Whatever you may have done, please rely on the power of that ocean of forgiveness

553
01:05:09,420 --> 01:05:15,440
and forgive yourself. So, please raise your right hand

554
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:22,000
in the corner of your neck and your shoulder and turn your right,

555
01:05:22,220 --> 01:05:28,640
turn your head towards right - as much as you can, push back your hand.

556
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:37,100
At this centers, one has to say with full confidence,

557
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:44,580
with full confidence,"Mother, I am not guilty at all, " sixteen times.

558
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:50,220
"Mother, I am not guilty at all, " sixteen times.

559
01:06:21,140 --> 01:06:28,300
Now, as I told you, that some people say, it's very difficult to forgive others

560
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:35,420
but whether you forgive or you don't forgive, it's a myth. But if you don't forgive, then you play into wrong hands.

561
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:42,540
So, have confidence in yourself and now, raise your right hand

562
01:06:42,700 --> 01:06:48,580
on your forehead across and bend your head. At this point,

563
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:57,460
you have to say, without counting people, without thinking about them,

564
01:06:57,660 --> 01:07:01,920
just say, "Mother, I forgive everyone."

565
01:07:02,180 --> 01:07:08,580
You say it from your heart, not how many times but say it from your heart, which is very important.

566
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:28,320
Now, take back your right hand on to the back side of your head, where the optic lobe is

567
01:07:28,520 --> 01:07:35,880
and now push your head upward, as much as you can, resting on that hand.

568
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:42,280
Here again, without feeling guilty, without counting what mistakes you have committed

569
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:49,000
for your own satisfaction, you have to say from your heart, not how many times,

570
01:07:49,980 --> 01:07:57,380
"Oh Divine, please forgive, forgive me if I have done any mistakes."

571
01:07:58,740 --> 01:08:01,980
Say it from your heart.

572
01:08:35,180 --> 01:08:42,160
Now, stretch your hand fully and put the center of your palm

573
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:48,180
on the fontanel bone area, which was a soft bone

574
01:08:48,380 --> 01:08:54,560
in your childhood. Press it hard. Now, really push back your fingers, as much as you can,

575
01:08:54,840 --> 01:09:00,400
to put a pressure on that area and now bend your head.

576
01:09:01,480 --> 01:09:05,860
Please move your hand seven times

577
01:09:06,660 --> 01:09:14,560
in a clockwise manner. But here again, I cannot get over your

578
01:09:15,220 --> 01:09:22,220
freedom, in the sense that I cannot insult your freedom. I respect you, so I would

579
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:28,020
say that, you have to ask for your Self-realization. So, you have to say seven times,

580
01:09:29,260 --> 01:09:37,240
"Mother, please give me Self-realization." I cannot force it on you. Seven times.

582

[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS IN TO THE MICROPHONE]

583
01:09:55,460 --> 01:10:01,320
[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS IN TO THE MICROPHONE]

[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS IN TO THE MICROPHONE]

589
01:10:41,900 --> 01:10:48,780
Now please, take down your hands, both the hands and slowly open your eyes, slowly open your eyes.

590
01:10:49,020 --> 01:10:52,920
Slowly. Now, put both the hands towards Me, like this.

591
01:10:56,700 --> 01:11:01,740
Now, put the right hand towards Me, little higher like that -

592
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:08,580
right hand and now, put down your head and with your left hand you see here

593
01:11:08,820 --> 01:11:12,740
in the fontanel bone area, if there's a cool breeze coming?

594
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:20,460
Now, don't doubt it - there's no air conditioning or anything working it out that thing. From inside you'll feel the cool breeze coming in.

595
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:26,020
Bend your head. Now, don't doubt because then you go in the lower level of thought.

596
01:11:26,280 --> 01:11:32,340
Just see for yourself, if there's a cool breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area.

597
01:11:42,180 --> 01:11:48,140
Now, please put the  left hand towards Me, like this higher and now, again bend your head

598
01:11:48,340 --> 01:11:54,820
and see for yourself with the right hand, if there's a cool breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area.

599
01:11:55,040 --> 01:12:01,040
Sometimes there could be little heat also, doesn't matter, it will disappear. If there's heat in the body, it has to come out.

600
01:12:08,620 --> 01:12:13,000
Once again, put left hand towards Me - right hand again,

601
01:12:13,320 --> 01:12:18,360
towards Me. Once again, put right hand towards Me and see with your left hand

602
01:12:18,580 --> 01:12:25,840
bending your head, if there's a cool breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area.

603
01:12:28,280 --> 01:12:34,000
Good! Now, please put your both the hands up like this

604
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:39,700
and push back your head, push back as much as you can, and now you can ask a question,

605
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:46,960
"Mother, is this  the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost? Mother, is this the cool breeze of the All-Pervading Divine power?"

606
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:53,500
You ask this question three times, just ask this question, "Is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?" -

607
01:12:53,700 --> 01:12:58,160
three times, please. Now,

608
01:13:06,200 --> 01:13:10,500
Now, take down your hands, please take down your hands.

609
01:13:10,980 --> 01:13:15,560
You feel very relaxed, very relaxed and

610
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:20,640
[UNCLEAR] Now see, if you're feeling the cool breeze in your hand?

611
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:31,160
Now, those people who have felt the cool breeze in their hand or the cool breeze out of your fontanel bone area,

612
01:13:31,660 --> 01:13:35,860
please, raise both your hands.

613
01:13:40,460 --> 01:13:47,080
Ah, just imagine! You're all saints now, so I better say

614
01:13:47,500 --> 01:13:53,000
I'll bow to you. May God bless you! It's beautiful, started with so many.

615
01:13:53,240 --> 01:13:58,460
Some did not feel, doesn't matter. We'll have it tomorrow - you're all going to feel it.

616
01:13:58,780 --> 01:14:04,320
So nice, but now don't think about it. When you come down,

617
01:14:04,540 --> 01:14:07,820
don't think about it - just be silent.

618
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:15,240
Sleep well tonight. Tomorrow again we'll work it out and fix it up.

619
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:20,580
May God bless you! May god bless you!

620
01:14:22,220 --> 01:14:29,560
May God bless you! We have a very nice center here and I'm sure we want our progress very well here.

621
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:33,260
May God bless you! Thank you very much.

622
01:14:34,120 --> 01:14:40,940
It's not well, so many, really! We, we 'll have to work it out tomorrow morning also.
