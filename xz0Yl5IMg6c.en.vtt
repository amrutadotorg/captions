00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:11.560
It is so wonderful for your Mother to see so many

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.680
beautiful Sahaja yogis assembled together,

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.880
on this day of Sahasrara.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.960
I think the first era of Sahaja Yoga has ended now,

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.040
and new has started.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:32.600
In the first era of Sahaja Yoga,

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.560
the starting point was first the opening of the Sahasrara.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.120
And gradually –

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:48.160
and gradually moving towards the completion,

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:53.520
I find there are so many who are great Sahaja yogis today.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.640
It is a very natural process of growth

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.160
that you have gone through.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:05.400
The first one was, we can say,

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.680
is just the awakening of the Kundalini,

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:15.520
and piercing the fontanel bone area.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.600
As you see on top of your head these bandhans,

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.200
that's how you too have in your head, same way.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.560
And you have the chakras same way built in,

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.800
in your Sahasrara.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:36.960
So in the first era of Sahaja Yoga we have awakened

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.680
the deities in your centers,

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:47.480
in the medulla oblongata and also in the brain.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:53.440
But now the time has come for us to spread it

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.720
on a horizontal level.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.040
And to move it on the horizontal level,

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:03.040
we have to understand how to go about it.

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:08.880
Like the seven colors of the rainbow,

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:14.680
we have got seven colors of the light of these centers,

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.680
of the chakras.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:22.080
And when we start it from the back,

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:28.120
from the Mooladhara, bringing it up to the,

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:36.240
this side, Agnya, then it is placed in a different order,

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.960
if you see it clearly.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:46.960
I mean to say that in the Sahasrara,

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.520
because it's a concave replacement,

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:58.280
is important to understand that the center

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:08.080
of the fontanel bone area corresponds to our heart.

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:16.240
So heart is the pivotal point for the second era now.

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.080
I hope you understand what I mean.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:26.240
So if you have to place your attention to Sahasrara,

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:32.080
first thing you have to do is to pay attention to your heart.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:40.160
In the Sahasrara, the Heart Chakra and the heart itself,

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.080
the Atma, coincide.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:51.720
Means the Jagadamba becomes one with the heart –

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.840
that is the Atma.

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.160
So we see that here the yoga takes place.

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:07.160
At this point of time it is very important to understand

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:12.160
that we have to take a bigger step.

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:19.160
The whole Sahasrara moves in this way,

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:24.280
all these chakras throw their lights in this way,

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:34.920
in a clockwise manner; and this axis is the heart.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:41.320
So the essence of all the religions, of all the prophets,

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:46.840
of all the incarnations is compassion,

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:51.200
and it’s placed in this Chakra of Heart.

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.160
Thus we understand that in the second era now,

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:00.760
we have to have compassion.

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:05.120
Is the manifestation now of the compassion.

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:10.040
If God Almighty had no compassion,

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:18.400
He would not have created this great universe.

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:22.680
Actually His Power, or the Adi Shakti,

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:25.640
is the embodiment of His compassion.

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:32.400
And this compassion has brought forth all the evolution

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:39.080
to human level, and even your emancipation as Sahaja yogis.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:43.800
And compassion is always completely covered

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:47.760
with forgiveness.

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:52.320
So you can see, the Trinity meets at this point.

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:59.000
The Son of God is forgiveness,

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.440
is the embodiment of forgiveness.

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:07.400
So the God Almighty who is the witness,

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:10.440
the Mother who is the compassion

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.480
and the Child who is the forgiveness,

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:17.920
all of them meet at Heart Chakra, in the Sahasrara.

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:27.800
Now, one must learn how to improve Sahasrara itself.

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:34.080
You know the presiding deity of the Sahasrara very well.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:42.160
Now the place of Sahasrara is in your head,

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.680
as you think it to be,

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:50.360
but it’s just the center of the whole universe.

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:55.800
To develop this, you have to pay attention

00:06:55.880 --> 00:07:02.600
to your Heart Chakra in the fontanel bone area.

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:07.560
If you pay attention to the fontanel bone area,

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:14.320
then there you must establish the deity.

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:19.920
But this deity has to be first established into the heart.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.800
Now you are very lucky people that you have the deity

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:25.960
in person with you.

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:31.520
The people who got realization before I came on this Earth

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:34.360
had to imagine the deities,

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:39.600
and in that imagination they were never perfect.

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:45.480
But as they say that at Sahasrara She is Mahamaya –

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:48.120
that is how it is described –

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:52.680
so if you also see the person,

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:55.840
you may not be knowing fully that person

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:59.240
or in the perfect way or a complete way,

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:02.120
because Mahamaya Shakti is much greater

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:04.160
than your imagination.

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:07.160
That is why one has to surrender.

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:13.080
With your limited imagination of brain,

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:18.600
one cannot see the deity.

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:21.640
Also it is said She is Bhakti Gamya:

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:26.040
you can know through bhakti, through devotion.

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:28.640
So the devotion has to be there,

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:33.400
but the devotion has to be a very clean devotion,

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:36.440
in the sense there should be no malice in the heart.

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:38.840
Heart should be clean.

00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:43.160
Heart, to keep it clean is very difficult.

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:48.440
Always human beings have a relative understanding of

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:50.200
of reality,

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:52.880
but reality is absolute.

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:58.560
So to achieve that, one has to get rid of all

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:04.240
the other kind of impurities that are within the heart.

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:09.160
But what next, in the new era that has to come?

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:13.560
As you have now good families, good ashrams,

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:21.320
good jobs, everyone is happy, let us think of the next era.

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:25.200
Next era is of compassion, as I told you.

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:29.520
But any one of the chakras are weak in you still;

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:34.600
the light that becomes white because of the seven colors

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:38.960
may dim out, or may be defective.

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:42.320
So, all the chakras that are within us

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:43.960
are to be looked after.

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:52.600
To pay attention to every chakra, and put compassion,

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:57.920
the feeling of compassion on these chakras.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.960
So now when you wanted that all the time,

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:07.760
and you felt happy, secured, joyous

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:10.960
when you had that in person before you.

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:14.960
Then in the second era, now,

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:20.400
you will not desire so much that Mother should be there –

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:23.360
you'll take it over from Me.

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:28.440
This is the divine desire I'm telling you about,

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:32.960
and you have to work on that from today onwards.

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:37.160
I am with you, you know that; but need not be in this body,

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:40.720
because I don’t know if I exist in this body or not.

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:44.200
But once this desire starts working,

00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:47.720
you will see tremendous miracles happening.

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:50.640
When the child is born to a mother,

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:54.760
automatically she gets milk.

00:10:54.840 --> 00:11:00.040
So the nature is so connected with the whole thing.

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:04.560
In your divine desire also it is connected.

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:08.840
And it is very evident when you are a divine person.

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:11.040
So you may find Me anywhere:

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:12.960
you are walking on the street,

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:17.760
suddenly you might find Mataji walking with you.

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:22.320
So this is the second era we have started,

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:24.800
and you should not be shocked

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:28.600
if you see Me sitting on your bed

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:34.080
and putting My hand on your head.

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:40.600
Or you may see Me in the form of Christ

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:42.760
walking into your room,

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:44.880
or as Shri Rama.

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:46.360
That has to happen,

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:51.000
so you should be prepared.

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:57.320
Already so many miracles have taken place on you,

00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:59.640
but on a grosser level.

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:02.640
We have seen the light coming on My head,

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:05.760
and the photographs have shown some miracles to you.

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:07.800
But many things will happen,

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:11.920
that you will see something that you could never imagine.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.960
This has to happen, just to convince you

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:21.400
that you have reached a certain height of your evolution

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:27.360
in the new area of Pragyalok.

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:29.520
Because this is a new state into which

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:34.360
now you will be entering, on a horizontal basis.

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:42.080
In this area you will give up asking for gross things,

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:47.680
and also for anything subtler, anything that is subtle.

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:50.240
The asking will disappear,

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:54.000
and that is the time you’ll become very powerful.

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:57.200
Whatever I say happens, as you know;

00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:06.680
only thing, I cannot command you to be evolved.

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:15.120
The Kundalini's work in you has been done, quite a lot.

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:20.200
Now the new work of compassion,

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:25.880
of spreading it to others has to be done by you.

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:29.600
As the light grows brighter and brighter,

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:36.520
the area it covers becomes bigger and bigger.

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:40.120
So you become the giver of compassion.

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:43.760
In My last lecture, which you have heard already,

00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:49.240
I have requested you how to do tapah.

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:56.440
With a complete surrendered mind you have to go through

00:13:56.520 --> 00:14:01.880
the pilgrimage, say, of this castle.

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:05.000
This is one of the glimpses of the tapah

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:08.200
that you have to do, because I am told

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:13.960
some of you had to get into little difficulties,

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:16.480
and you people suffered a little bit

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:19.240
on your way for the pilgrimage.

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:29.560
But it is fun to be venturesome and to get into places

00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:32.880
where the devils dare not go.

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:38.880
And if you know how to get fun out of the so-called

00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:41.880
discomforts, then you should know

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:44.120
you are on the right lights.

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:49.320
And as you start becoming discreet automatically,

00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:52.760
you should know you are progressing well.

00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:56.600
As you become more peaceful and your temper

00:14:56.680 --> 00:15:00.600
vanishes in the thin air as soon as you see somebody

00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:06.080
attacking you, then know that you are progressing well.

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:17.000
As soon as you see a ordeal or a calamity falling on

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:19.960
the personality and you do not get worried about it,

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:22.560
then know that you are progressing.

00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:24.360
No amount ….

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:27.720
When no amount of artificiality can impress you,

00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:30.720
then know that you are progressing.

00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:39.680
No amount of material well-being in others

00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:44.760
makes you unhappy, no more unhappy,

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:47.800
then know that you are progressing well.

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:52.560
No amount of

00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:01.320
labor or

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:13.640
or troubles are sufficient to become a Sahaja yogi.

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:18.400
Any – whatever you may try, one cannot become a Sahaja yogi,

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:24.440
while you have got it without any effort.

00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:28.040
So you are something special.

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:32.280
So this, once you understand that you are special,

00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:35.480
you will become humble about it.

00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:41.440
Then when it happens to you that you’ve humbled down

00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:44.200
when you see you have achieved something,

00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:46.480
that you have some powers,

00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:52.320
that you are emitting innocence, that you are discreet,

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:57.080
and as a result of that you become more compassion,

00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:01.240
humbler personality, a sweeter personality,

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:04.720
then you should believe

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:08.160
that you are in the heart of your Mother.

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:13.320
This is what is the sign of the new Sahaja yogi now

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:21.960
in the new era, who has to move with new force.

00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:29.280
Where you will grow so fast that without meditation,

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:32.080
you will be in meditation;

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:37.040
without being in My presence, you will be in My presence;

00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:44.600
without asking, you will be blessed by your Father.

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:47.720
This is what you are in for;

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:53.960
and again I welcome you to this new era today,

00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:56.840
on this great day of Sahasrara.

00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:59.120
May God bless you all.
