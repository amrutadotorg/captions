WEBVTT

00:09.280 --> 00:27.840
Today we have gathered here to worship Shri
Krishna's incarnation. As you know that Shri

00:27.840 --> 00:37.420
Krishna is the incarnation of Narayana, of
Shri Vishnu. So in every incarnation they

00:37.420 --> 00:51.170
carry all their qualities, all their powers
and all their nature with them. So when He

00:51.170 --> 01:05.700
incarnated He had all the qualities of Narayana
and then that of Rama, but every incarnation

01:05.700 --> 01:18.500
tries to rectify whatever in their previous
life has been misunderstood and have been

01:18.500 --> 01:42.039
carried to the extremes. That's why they have
to come back again and again.

01:42.039 --> 01:58.780
So as Shri Vishnu, when He thought of taking
His incarnation, because He is the one who

01:58.780 --> 02:13.460
is the preserver. He's the preserver of this
creation and also the preserver of dharma.

02:13.460 --> 02:24.510
So when He took His incarnation He had to
see that people keep to their dharma. By keeping

02:24.510 --> 02:38.379
the dharma all right only, you could get your
realization. So the job was quite difficult

02:38.379 --> 02:53.849
one, I should say, to keep people in the central
path of Mahalakshmi. So by first incarnation,

02:53.849 --> 03:05.830
you can say that, He tried to create a benevolent
king, as Shri Rama. Socrates has described

03:05.830 --> 03:14.860
a benevolent king. But as a result of that,
people started thinking if they have become

03:14.860 --> 03:24.629
queen and king, born in the family of royalty,
then they are gods.

03:24.629 --> 03:33.330
Shri Rama was the Purushottama - means He
was the best among all the human beings. That

03:33.330 --> 03:41.950
means He incarnated as a human being, total
human being, showing all the qualities of

03:41.950 --> 03:55.659
human beings. Like He was, He married the
Lakshmi principle that was Sita, and then

03:55.659 --> 04:04.659
also He lived a normal married life. When
He gave Her up He lived like an ascetic to

04:04.659 --> 04:14.480
show how a man should lead his life in a proper
dharma as a married man. And even when the

04:14.480 --> 04:24.930
wife has gone away, how He was leading a life
of complete chastity. And He never had another

04:24.930 --> 04:32.070
marriage, though many people said that "You
should have another marriage."

04:32.070 --> 04:43.550
So the system that was the best, to have a
monogamy, He followed it. By His life, He

04:43.550 --> 04:54.750
showed how a husband should be with his wife.
But then later on He had another role as the

04:54.750 --> 05:04.259
king. When He became the king then He found
out that people were criticizing Him because

05:04.259 --> 05:16.270
He brought Sita back from Ravana. So Shri
Rama decided to send Her away from Him. How

05:16.270 --> 05:25.210
many people in this world, who are in power,
would be that sensible about that power that

05:25.210 --> 05:33.750
they have, that they have to behave in a manner
that they should be ideals, for all other

05:33.750 --> 05:39.819
people who are working under them, for the
administration, for looking after the country?

05:39.819 --> 05:50.180
But Sitaji also, because She was also Mahalakshmi,
She understood everything, the whole play,

05:50.180 --> 06:01.979
and She went away and then Shri Rama also
taught how to rule the people. So they say

06:01.979 --> 06:06.310
the most ideal kingdom was Ramaraj.

06:06.310 --> 06:16.259
When Rama ruled this world there was peace,
no competitions, everyone was joyous and happy

06:16.259 --> 06:29.830
because He was the one who was emitting fair
play and dharma, joy, bliss and peace. So

06:29.830 --> 06:38.330
there was no need to have any struggle, no
competition, no fighting, nothing. So this

06:38.330 --> 06:47.819
Benevolent King came as a incarnation to show
us how a king should be, and He lead a life

06:47.819 --> 06:56.270
of a serious type, very dedicated and serious
type of life, how a benevolent king should

06:56.270 --> 07:07.830
be. As a result of His incarnation - always
people take to something, something which

07:07.830 --> 07:22.979
is not normal. So because He lived as an ascetic
people started following asceticism. "We'll

07:22.979 --> 07:29.740
not marry, we'll not have our wives, we'll
live like Rama," all these things they started,

07:29.740 --> 07:33.599
so asceticism grew up. Before that, before
Shri Rama all the saints used to marry, they

07:33.599 --> 07:42.349
used to have wives they used to have children,
they lived a very normal life. Only they were

07:42.349 --> 07:50.169
saints because they were very highly evolved
people and they lived in ashrams doing the

07:50.169 --> 07:57.639
work of realization and also other corrections
in human beings.

07:57.639 --> 08:08.509
Now when Shri Rama came, people thought that
"He was Shri Rama, so let us be like Him.

08:08.509 --> 08:15.620
Because He lived like an ascetic let us also
live like an ascetic." So this foolish idea

08:15.620 --> 08:26.780
of asceticism crawled in and then people became
very austere type, very austere. Nobody would

08:26.780 --> 08:32.659
laugh, nobody would smile, everything was
very serious, absolutely, and everything was

08:32.659 --> 08:44.470
done in a very dry manner. So many seekers
did not marry but apart from seekers many

08:44.470 --> 08:50.410
seers and saints also did not marry and because
they had no balance, because marriage gives

08:50.410 --> 08:57.960
you a balance, they became very dry people,
very hot tempered people, and we have some

08:57.960 --> 09:05.960
examples of some rishis who are known for
their hot temper and their ascetic qualities

09:05.960 --> 09:15.110
by which they could destroy anyone, make them
into ashes - in Sanskrit it's called as Bhasma

09:15.110 --> 09:25.890
Karoti. So these qualities developed, that
is the time Shri Krishna came back, from Shri

09:25.890 --> 09:30.980
Rama's incarnation He came back as Shri Krishna.

09:30.980 --> 09:41.810
Sri Krishna's incarnation came to show that
this whole Creation is fun, is Leela. That's

09:41.810 --> 09:49.620
why He's Leeladhar, He's called as Leeladhara.
He was the one who showed that everything

09:49.620 --> 10:00.540
is fun, there's nothing to be serious, nothing
to be dry, nothing to be ascetic but the whole

10:00.540 --> 10:13.440
life is a fun. He gave this idea because people
had become so austere. And then also a kind

10:13.440 --> 10:22.890
of a funny Brahminism started, like they would
not eat, they created a caste system which

10:22.890 --> 10:28.540
started developing. The caste was determined
by birth, which was wrong, and they could

10:28.540 --> 10:37.370
not eat food. Then the Brahminism started
growing up, quite strong, and these Brahmins

10:37.370 --> 10:53.380
started dominating others. So Shri Krishna
came and He came as a son of a milkman (gwale

10:53.380 --> 11:10.610
ki ladke). But they were rich milkmen, very
rich milkmen. Now that is the time, you see,

11:10.610 --> 11:21.760
the whole play was brought forth, and the
play was quite cruel I should say, because

11:21.760 --> 11:45.810
one horrible devil, rakshasa, somehow or other
used a lady who
was mother of Kamsa, and she is the mother

11:45.810 --> 11:54.080
also of, you can say grandmother of Shri Krishna.
So she had a son who was also a rakshasa,

11:54.080 --> 12:06.400
so it's all a play of the same. So He had
an uncle who was a devil, who was a rakshasa

12:06.400 --> 12:10.000
and He was supposed to kill this uncle - see
the play, this is a drama all, just see the

12:10.000 --> 12:18.350
drama as it worked out. He was supposed to
kill this uncle who was very powerful and

12:18.350 --> 12:21.520
who was a devil.

12:21.520 --> 12:37.080
So in His childhood He used to play, He used
to play with milkmaids and with other ladies.

12:37.080 --> 12:43.300
He was very young, He was about five years
of age. And He did all kinds of pranks and

12:43.300 --> 12:53.500
He did all kinds of leelas, like He killed
one snake, very big snake - a cobra - very

12:53.500 --> 13:01.700
well known cobra. And also He killed many
rakshasas and rakshasinis with His power - in

13:01.700 --> 13:09.700
a play. Just in a play, He used to do it,
and you must have read the stories about Him

13:09.700 --> 13:17.240
- how He showed that there is no need to have
a big army of people as Shri Rama had - He

13:17.240 --> 13:26.210
didn't use any monkeys or anyone, though Hanumana
was always, was sitting on His chariot. But

13:26.210 --> 13:34.800
He never used all these outside powers. Only
whatever He had the weapons that He used,

13:34.800 --> 13:47.870
to show that there is no need to use any army
or other people to kill a rakshasa. And all

13:47.870 --> 13:51.480
was in a very playful manner.

13:51.480 --> 14:00.480
At the time of Shri Rama He was not supposed
to know that He was an incarnation but it

14:00.480 --> 14:11.750
was reflected to Him by various methods that
He was an incarnation and still He would not

14:11.750 --> 14:21.040
accept it because He was not supposed to know.
It's something like Mahamaya. But say all

14:21.040 --> 14:34.110
the cameras are now giving you all the evidence
of the real Mahamaya, what She is like. But

14:34.110 --> 14:42.700
one may try to show that you don't remember,
you don't have, you have no memory of it.

14:42.700 --> 14:48.690
Because if you remember it then your action
would not be human, they would become divine

14:48.690 --> 14:55.020
actions, and that may be not all right for
human beings because they won't be able to

14:55.020 --> 15:01.260
stand, or they'll be frightened, they'll be
such an awe.

15:01.260 --> 15:12.230
So Shri Krishna normally behaved like a very
ordinary person. Like in His childhood, He

15:12.230 --> 15:19.840
was very fond of butter. And as you know butter
is very good for the throat. For Vishuddhi

15:19.840 --> 15:26.890
I've told you many-a-times that on your tea
you put some butter and take it so that your

15:26.890 --> 15:33.580
throat which is dried out will feel better.
So He was very fond of butter and He would

15:33.580 --> 15:41.560
go and make His friends help Him, and made
a pyramid out of them, would climb up and

15:41.560 --> 15:47.800
break the butter container and would eat all
that butter like a little baby.

15:47.800 --> 15:51.910
So one day His mother said, "All right, why
did you eat butter?"

15:51.910 --> 15:53.390
He said, "I never ate."

15:53.390 --> 15:55.240
She said, "Then what is this on your mouth?"

15:55.240 --> 15:59.030
He said, "This is, all these boys have put
it on my mouth."

15:59.030 --> 16:02.990
You see, to Him, even telling such little,
little lies also was a fun, with the mother

16:02.990 --> 16:11.340
to that extent. Like "don't tell lies! You
must not!" No, there was no fun in this kind

16:11.340 --> 16:12.650
of thing.

16:12.650 --> 16:17.340
So He told her a lie. "See now, these people
have put it on my mouth. They have eaten all

16:17.340 --> 16:26.400
the butter and now I am the one you are catching!"
you see.

16:26.400 --> 16:27.400
So she said, "Really? Open your mouth!"

16:27.400 --> 16:31.770
So He opened His mouth and there She saw all
this [universe] (Mother points to the solar

16:31.770 --> 16:33.020
system which is part of the puja decoration
backdrop) in the mouth. The whole universe

16:33.020 --> 16:39.010
moving in the Vishuddhi, the complete Vishuddhi
chakra she saw, and she just bowed to Him.

16:39.010 --> 16:49.700
Then He says, "Why are you bowing to Me?"
as if nothing has happened.

16:49.700 --> 17:03.930
So, you see, all His pranks and all His childish,
sweet lies, were just to create a feeling

17:03.930 --> 17:13.589
of understanding, and it's regarded as something
very sweet, according to the Indians, or we

17:13.589 --> 17:17.990
can say according to the eastern ideas, that
children are naughty like that with the mother.

17:17.990 --> 17:24.600
They all enjoy the naughtiness of the children,
little naughtiness here, naughtiness there.

17:24.600 --> 17:37.170
And the strictness of children to a great
extent, also is there because, I think, people

17:37.170 --> 17:42.220
are not attached to their children. They don't
love their children. They love their carpets,

17:42.220 --> 17:48.290
love everything else because they can sell
it, but they can't sell their children. And

17:48.290 --> 17:59.150
that kills the joy. So the children and the
parents are separated by materialistic ideas

17:59.150 --> 18:04.720
that this material is more important than
their own children.

18:04.720 --> 18:09.590
So in His childhood He has shown lots of pranks
and lot of things, and the way He used to

18:09.590 --> 18:16.610
steal also. Now stealing is supposed to be
bad. Some, belongs to somebody else, if you

18:16.610 --> 18:22.500
steal, is bad. But He was stealing only the
butter of His mother that He had made them.

18:22.500 --> 18:28.780
And He used to steal the butter of all the
ladies who used to take down to Mathura, where

18:28.780 --> 18:36.590
Kamsa was ruling, and this butter was eaten
by all the rakshasas there and they were becoming

18:36.590 --> 18:42.030
very powerful. So He thought best thing is
to go and eat all the butter so that these

18:42.030 --> 18:49.420
ladies won't be able to go and sell it. Also
if you see it significantly is this that we

18:49.420 --> 18:55.770
starve our children, we starve our families,
just to have some money. Money orientation

18:55.770 --> 19:04.910
is there, that you can go and sell your butter
to somebody. With this idea - everything to

19:04.910 --> 19:09.810
be sold out, we have to sell out this, we
have to sell out that. Nothing is going to

19:09.810 --> 19:18.270
be kept with ourselves. So the children are
the only permanent liabilities, so the children

19:18.270 --> 19:25.550
are treated as if they are just burdens while
all other things are good because you can

19:25.550 --> 19:30.560
sell it. So the whole value system, if it
runs down to money, then children have no

19:30.560 --> 19:32.500
place in the family.

19:32.500 --> 19:45.310
According to Sahaja Yoga, children are more
important than all the wealth of the world

19:45.310 --> 19:50.800
and they are to be looked after that way.
Of course they should be told what is dignity

19:50.800 --> 19:55.740
is, how to behave themselves. But their little,
little pranks are to be understood and enjoyed

19:55.740 --> 20:01.680
because only as children they can do pranks,
not as grown ups, so they should have that

20:01.680 --> 20:09.910
much freedom to play pranks and to play some
tricks on you. Otherwise, they'll become very

20:09.910 --> 20:17.830
serious people and might become ascetic. Those
parents who are very strict, their children

20:17.830 --> 20:27.520
are never normal; they either are extremely
perverse, rebellious or they are quiet down

20:27.520 --> 20:37.680
and they cannot face life. So both are of
the same style because one cannot face life

20:37.680 --> 20:42.610
another cannot be faced by life. It's like
this. Nobody can face such people.

20:42.610 --> 20:46.890
So you have to treat you children with great
love and understanding but they should know

20:46.890 --> 20:52.110
if they misbehave then this love will be finished.
So children only care for love. They don't

20:52.110 --> 20:59.470
know money. They don't know anything. So the
love that is you establish in your child becomes

20:59.470 --> 21:07.430
very precious thing. So the system of Sahaja
Yoga is based on divine love and it can only

21:07.430 --> 21:13.210
work when people are loving. If they love
money, if they love power, if they love their

21:13.210 --> 21:19.230
reputation, they love this, love that, and
not their own children or their families then

21:19.230 --> 21:27.260
they are absolutely losing a very big part
of the society and God knows what's going

21:27.260 --> 21:32.140
to happen to these children if you do not
have love for your children.

21:32.140 --> 21:39.960
In Shri Krishna's life, you can see various
things He has shown. In His, you can say in

21:39.960 --> 21:49.690
His epic or in His biography if you see, you
will find how many facets of life He has handled

21:49.690 --> 22:00.630
with such beauty. Then in His childhood, then
He goes and kills the devil of Kamsa. That

22:00.630 --> 22:08.180
too, how beautifully He does it. How He kills
the people who are surrounding Him. How He

22:08.180 --> 22:18.950
knows their secrets, how they can be killed,
it shows complete brilliance and very beautiful

22:18.950 --> 22:29.220
organizing the whole thing. Now imagine one
Krishna fought, one Krishna fought the whole

22:29.220 --> 22:37.430
army of that Kamsa, how He must have done
it, because after all He's Viraat. And the,

22:37.430 --> 22:46.710
all the powers that are of this all-pervading
Power are in His hands. He can do whatever

22:46.710 --> 22:52.530
He likes. He can play around as He likes.
He can finish off anybody He wants, and it

22:52.530 --> 22:58.610
is so easy for Him to manage all these things
simultaneously.

22:58.610 --> 23:05.970
Then came His life when He became the king.
When He became the king He wanted, I should

23:05.970 --> 23:17.740
say in a way that, He wanted to establish
people in dharma and He needed the help of

23:17.740 --> 23:25.440
the five elements. So He made them into five
ladies whom He married; so He has five wives

23:25.440 --> 23:32.420
but they are five elements, part and parcel
of His being. But He was Yogeshwara, absolutely

23:32.420 --> 23:39.320
detached in His yoga, but He had, for practical
purposes we can say, five wives. And they

23:39.320 --> 23:46.500
were sixteen thousand women who became His
wives. These sixteen thousand women are nothing

23:46.500 --> 23:56.059
but His sixteen thousand powers because you
know His chakras they have got sixteen petals

23:56.059 --> 24:02.280
and these sixteen petals multiplied by the
Virata's one thousand petals each - so it

24:02.280 --> 24:10.200
comes to sixteen thousand powers. So these
sixteen thousand powers were incarnated as

24:10.200 --> 24:17.370
women, were taken away by some horrible king
and He went there, fought that king and brought

24:17.370 --> 24:18.740
these ladies.

24:18.740 --> 24:26.780
Now, even now it is so that even an old man,
has a young lady with Him, people will never

24:26.780 --> 24:31.220
think that there is good relationship. They'll
always think there must be something wrong.

24:31.220 --> 24:35.900
So He had to marry them, because He had to
keep these ladies, so He married them. But

24:35.900 --> 24:41.730
mother's position is different because mother
can have thousand children. But poor man,

24:41.730 --> 24:49.100
even if he has one woman around him, everybody
will say he's a bad person. So He had to marry

24:49.100 --> 24:56.200
all of them, so-called marriage, and these
sixteen thousand powers stayed with Him by

24:56.200 --> 25:01.050
which He established our Vishuddhi Chakra.

25:01.050 --> 25:06.960
Now when we have our Vishuddhi problems we
have to know what are the deities on both

25:06.960 --> 25:14.809
the sides and what were their qualities which
are lacking in us - that's why we are suffering.

25:14.809 --> 25:29.400
Let's see the right side Vishuddhi when we
catch. Shri Krishna's essence is sweetness

25:29.400 --> 25:35.610
- madhuriya, madhuriya. And His power was
Radha. "Ra" is energy "dha," means the one

25:35.610 --> 25:42.120
who has sustained the energy. And Her power
was, She was called as Ahlada. "Ahlada" means

25:42.120 --> 25:49.860
joy giving qualities She had. So Shri Krishna's
qualities were that He was Yogeshwara, so

25:49.860 --> 26:02.210
He was the witness and sweetness. Now a person
who shouts and screams and talks loudly and

26:02.210 --> 26:11.470
loses his temper in a very loud voice, or
who speaks very loudly all the time, they

26:11.470 --> 26:20.330
all suffer from the right Vishuddhi.. So one
should understand that even when you have

26:20.330 --> 26:25.650
to scold somebody, you have to just say, "What
are you doing? Why are you doing like this?"

26:25.650 --> 26:32.980
Otherwise "I give you, oh do like this?" Finished!
Right Vishuddhi over. It's finished now.

26:32.980 --> 26:39.320
So for the right Vishuddhi we use the mantra
of Vitthala and Rukmini, these two persons.

26:39.320 --> 26:44.290
You see it is very significant that also,
because they say that there was a pundalikaksh,

26:44.290 --> 26:53.050
one boy who was serving his parents. And his
parents were sleeping, he was pressing their

26:53.050 --> 26:58.809
feet when Vitthala and His power Rukmini,
they appeared in the door.

26:58.809 --> 27:06.010
But he said, "Now keep quiet. My parents are
sleeping so you stay there!"

27:06.010 --> 27:13.870
So he had one brick near him which he threw
and asked them, "You stay on that."

27:13.870 --> 27:21.240
So They kept quiet, They kept quiet because
they are sleeping. Now this is the thing is.

27:21.240 --> 27:32.850
On the right side if you are talking loudly,
if you talk too much, if you intimidate people

27:32.850 --> 27:40.140
with your talking then you catch on right
Vishuddhi. So for that best is to take some

27:40.140 --> 27:48.440
rest and give some rest to your right Vishuddhi
by stopping your talk. Go into mauna they

27:48.440 --> 27:53.570
say, just don't talk. For some time if you
don't talk you will see that your Vishuddhi

27:53.570 --> 27:55.760
will be improved, your problems will be improved.

27:55.760 --> 28:04.320
So as it happens, the right side, what happens
is that the heat starts coming from the stomach.

28:04.320 --> 28:11.400
It's all in one play. From the, we can say,
not from the stomach but actually from the

28:11.400 --> 28:18.700
liver, the heat starts rising. It first goes
into right heart, as a result you might become

28:18.700 --> 28:24.990
a very hot-tempered husband or a father or
something. You might get asthma, anything,

28:24.990 --> 28:29.530
with that right heart. Then it passes on to
your right Vishuddhi. When it goes to your

28:29.530 --> 28:33.070
right Vishuddhi then you become a very irritable,
hot-tempered person. All the time you shout

28:33.070 --> 28:40.670
at someone. Nobody can talk to you. If somebody
has to talk to you, he has to use a barge

28:40.670 --> 28:46.610
pole in between. God knows what time he'll
shout at you. Or maybe, I've seen many women

28:46.610 --> 28:51.190
lose their hearing or men lose their hearing
when there is somebody who is shouting at

28:51.190 --> 28:58.630
them. So shouting is a very bad thing for
others and also for yourself because, of course,

28:58.630 --> 29:04.120
your Vishuddhi goes out, after some time you
voice goes out, after some time you cannot

29:04.120 --> 29:12.670
talk, and sometimes they have to just keep
quiet. But for others it's even worse because

29:12.670 --> 29:19.670
if you use your anger in that manner then
that person might be just frightened of you,

29:19.670 --> 29:26.660
might develop inferiority complex, might become
a left sided person, might catch some bhoots

29:26.660 --> 29:32.980
or God knows what can happen to a person who
has somebody all the time shouting at him.

29:32.980 --> 29:36.940
But the worst physical thing could be that
he could become deaf.

29:36.940 --> 29:46.070
So from Shri Krishna's life one has to learn
that how He would just play His flute and

29:46.070 --> 29:57.790
the whole atmosphere used to become absolutely
quiet, without any ripple of any trouble,

29:57.790 --> 30:09.660
any idea of disturbance, just peaceful. But
in modern times the other way round. They

30:09.660 --> 30:14.679
have the music where the right Vishuddhi is
about to break or burst. I don't know what

30:14.679 --> 30:23.809
sort of a music it is. When they listen to
this music, you see, then it excites, then

30:23.809 --> 30:31.170
it excites you. It doesn't make you peaceful.
It excites you, excites you more and more.

30:31.170 --> 30:39.970
But, as Shri Krishna becomes Virata, your
limbic area also gets numbed with it. And

30:39.970 --> 30:47.020
when this shouting music is too much then
they have to use loud speakers and shout much

30:47.020 --> 30:52.230
more. Then they have to put something near
the ear to hear something otherwise they have

30:52.230 --> 31:02.610
no excitement. All the exciting, we can say
all the exciting cells become numbed. And

31:02.610 --> 31:11.760
you have to really go in for tremendous effort
to create that excitement in those numbed

31:11.760 --> 31:13.370
cells.

31:13.370 --> 31:19.480
So it's very dangerous throughout, if you
see that it starts from the liver, goes to

31:19.480 --> 31:27.760
the right heart, then to Vishuddhi and then
in the brain. So then you take to drugs because

31:27.760 --> 31:35.130
your brain is numbed out. So you take to drugs
and when you take to drugs then you feel that

31:35.130 --> 31:39.990
you are all right. Then again you feel that
this drug is not sufficient then you take

31:39.990 --> 31:44.510
stronger drugs. Then you take more drugs.
It goes on one after another. Ultimately,

31:44.510 --> 31:57.700
it reaches a stage when you are nowhere. So
it is all self-destructive.

31:57.700 --> 32:13.360
(Shri Mataji coughs) I am also using My right
Vishuddhi too much.

32:13.360 --> 32:27.220
For right Visuddhi you have to learn to have
mauna, means silence. Those who think, who

32:27.220 --> 32:33.850
are very dominating, who are talking in a
very dominating manner, whose right Vishuddhi

32:33.850 --> 32:42.740
is catching, should become silent and should,
at least for some time, should not talk at

32:42.740 --> 32:48.950
all. Maybe you might fix one day, say you
can do it on a ... say "I'll not talk on Monday."

32:48.950 --> 32:54.190
But supposing Monday you have to work, so
you should say "I'll not talk on Sunday."

32:54.190 --> 32:58.590
But human beings are such that if they decide
that they will not talk on Sunday, then Sunday

32:58.590 --> 33:07.809
they will talk the most!

33:07.809 --> 33:15.120
And this shouting and then intimidating people
- you have no right. You have no business

33:15.120 --> 33:22.570
to shout at anyone whatsoever. What is the
need to shout? After all, you are a human

33:22.570 --> 33:29.350
being, another one is a human being. God has
not given anybody whether it is a husband,

33:29.350 --> 33:35.320
wife, children or anyone. But I find even
these days children shout, the mother shouts,

33:35.320 --> 33:40.580
the father shouts. If you go in the house,
you feel like running back because you'll

33:40.580 --> 33:49.020
find, hear, nothing but shouts. So this kind
of a family system will rock, completely finish

33:49.020 --> 33:55.990
that family and there will be no beautiful
relationship between each other and between

33:55.990 --> 33:58.150
the other people.

33:58.150 --> 34:03.530
Sometimes who can say, the whole country is
having nothing but shouting at one and shouting

34:03.530 --> 34:09.319
at another. All over you go you find nothing
but shouting. Even if you take your car little

34:09.319 --> 34:15.690
bit this side there will be a shouting, I
mean. For the slightest excuse, they start

34:15.690 --> 34:20.230
shouting and spoiling their right Vishuddhi.
Now, for politicians, they think it's the

34:20.230 --> 34:28.450
best way to shout because they can really
impress people by their shouts you see. So

34:28.450 --> 34:33.460
they shout a lot, tell people this that. When
they speak, you should hear there's no sweetness

34:33.460 --> 34:38.980
in their tongue, nothing of the kind. But
they shout and by shouting a person gets frightened.

34:38.980 --> 34:43.350
"All right, you want the vote? We'll give
you but don't shout." That's how many people

34:43.350 --> 34:48.510
get elected and become big and think that
they are very successful because they have

34:48.510 --> 34:49.379
been shouting (laughter).

34:49.379 --> 34:56.050
Then they have training for shouting and they
go in for higher and higher education in shouting,

34:56.050 --> 35:07.660
how to shout, how to intimidate people by
the loud voices. For Sahaja Yogis it doesn't

35:07.660 --> 35:18.940
behove. Sahaja Yogi has to be a very sweet
person to talk, extremely sweet. Now when

35:18.940 --> 35:26.800
you are thinking of, say, Shri Rama as a person
who was a king, and then you have got Shri

35:26.800 --> 35:35.010
Krishna who was a diplomat. So what is the
divine diplomacy? You don't have to shout,

35:35.010 --> 35:46.840
but you change the subject. If you want to
bring somebody to a, some, conclusion - then

35:46.840 --> 35:52.730
best thing is first you change the subject
and gradually, if you are clever enough, then

35:52.730 --> 36:01.210
you go on changing, changing and you bring
it back to the right thing. That's the clever

36:01.210 --> 36:06.730
thing to do. Otherwise, just by shouting if
somebody may say, "Yes, all right, I'll do

36:06.730 --> 36:14.109
it," by the time you are gone they'll say,
"Yah, I'll do it." That means something else.

36:14.109 --> 36:20.240
So you see, he might say, "yes" and "yah"
anytime.

36:20.240 --> 36:26.730
So to have a complete rapport with another
person is to play with that person. That's

36:26.730 --> 36:32.320
what I did also in Russia. I went round and
round and round and round and brought him

36:32.320 --> 36:38.470
to the point that we have to be very independent
thing, and I managed it. That is Shri Krishna's

36:38.470 --> 36:45.450
style. You see, because to face it. Supposing
somebody says, "Oh this is my idea; I've decided

36:45.450 --> 36:52.070
to do this and that and everything," then
you should say slowly, "All right, now I would

36:52.070 --> 36:58.930
say what you are saying is correct, absolutely
correct. I agree with you and what do you

36:58.930 --> 37:05.090
think about the other thing?" something like
that. And then you should say, "Now, I can

37:05.090 --> 37:11.540
suggest. But I would like to suggest," like
this, "if you can agree to it." You see, gradually

37:11.540 --> 37:19.520
if you go and talk like this things can work
out and people can feel really that you have

37:19.520 --> 37:28.420
taken time and you have spent that much time
and have accepted their proposal and things.

37:28.420 --> 37:31.869
And they don't feel bad.

37:31.869 --> 37:52.560
So one has to know that what is the essence
of all this diplomacy. Can you tell me? What

37:52.560 --> 38:07.420
is the essence of this diplomacy? Is benevolence.
You have to achieve the benevolence of the

38:07.420 --> 38:14.440
whole humanity. This is the essence of it.
If you are doing it, you are not doing for

38:14.440 --> 38:19.220
yourself, for your gain. You are not doing
for the gain of any particular person. But

38:19.220 --> 38:26.400
you are doing it for the benevolence of the
whole humanity. So once, you know this is

38:26.400 --> 38:33.250
the essence, so what is the need to shout?
By shouting you are not going to achieve anything.

38:33.250 --> 38:38.450
So to play around with it and bring it to
that point which is benevolence.

38:38.450 --> 38:44.840
Like Krishna was asked that "You said that
you have to tell the truth and it has to be

38:44.840 --> 38:52.580
also very pleasing. Satyam vadet, priyam vadet."
He said, "how can it be?

38:52.580 --> 38:56.950
These two things cannot be. Supposing you
tell the truth people may not like it, may

38:56.950 --> 38:57.270
not please that person.

38:57.270 --> 39:04.090
So He said, "No. It should be 'Satyam vadet,
hitam vadet, priyam vadet.'" That "Tell the

39:04.090 --> 39:07.640
truth, tell for the benevolence and tell the
pleasing thing."

39:07.640 --> 39:19.580
Supposing you tell somebody the truth, he
may not like that at that time. Supposing

39:19.580 --> 39:23.150
you tell that person, "Now don't go today
by plane."

39:23.150 --> 39:27.720
He will not like it, "What do you mean? I'm
going to go."

39:27.720 --> 39:29.530
"No please don't go. I request you."

39:29.530 --> 39:36.350
Then he finds out that day the plane went
and had a crash. So he thinks, "This was good

39:36.350 --> 39:41.590
because for my benevolence this has worked
out. So this is something so good." So immediately,

39:41.590 --> 39:47.450
he feels obliged to you and he feels that
you have told him the truth by which it was

39:47.450 --> 39:53.180
his benevolence and that's why he's pleased.
So in the long run if you talk something for

39:53.180 --> 39:59.940
the benevolence of a person, for the benevolence
of the spirit, then such a person immediately

39:59.940 --> 40:13.820
thinks that we have really done such a great
obligation on him, that you have saved him.

40:13.820 --> 40:22.220
If even you have to tell some lies for the
benevolence, it does not matter. It will not

40:22.220 --> 40:27.240
have any effect because Shri Krishna, which
is the deity, knows it. For example, a man

40:27.240 --> 40:32.609
is coming to kill somebody and you know where
that man is hiding. He comes and asks you

40:32.609 --> 40:37.090
"Where is that man?" Are you supposed to tell
him the truth "All right, he's there. Go and

40:37.090 --> 40:44.740
kill him"? No. So what do you have to tell?
You have to tell him that "See. I'm not going

40:44.740 --> 40:51.460
to tell you. I don't know. Doesn't matter."
Because what he is asking is unauthorized

40:51.460 --> 40:59.460
is anadhikar. He had no business, he has no
authority to ask such a question. And he had

40:59.460 --> 41:05.690
no authority to extract the answer from you.
Whether you give him the answer or not answer

41:05.690 --> 41:11.720
is your right. If you understand that, it
is not for the benevolence for the man who

41:11.720 --> 41:17.180
wants to kill, because tomorrow he will be
hanged, and not also for the benevolence of

41:17.180 --> 41:25.790
the person whom he is seeking out. So if you
do like that then there is no problem. You'll

41:25.790 --> 41:31.849
find most of the people will just like you
because they will know that you are sincere,

41:31.849 --> 41:34.210
very honest, that you want to be benevolent.

41:34.210 --> 41:43.359
Now as you know I have told all of you everything,
whatever I felt like about you, most of the

41:43.359 --> 41:48.990
time I should say, not all of the time, but
of course most of the time. I have to also

41:48.990 --> 41:56.540
tell lies little bit. But whatever I do you
will find out is for your benevolence, is

41:56.540 --> 42:03.960
for your good. I have to tell you. I cannot
run away from that. I have to face it. So

42:03.960 --> 42:10.010
you cannot run away from telling people what
you think is right for them. Specially those

42:10.010 --> 42:16.359
about whom you are in charge. Like you have
children, you've got a family, you've got

42:16.359 --> 42:21.400
other relations, of whom you are in charge
then best thing is that you have to tell them

42:21.400 --> 42:30.130
frankly what you think and what is right.
It's your duty. Then people escape it also.

42:30.130 --> 42:34.560
Many people who don't want to face their children,
I have seen, they'll give them toys, toys

42:34.560 --> 42:38.320
after toys. They will not like to face their
children, tell them, "No, I don't like it.

42:38.320 --> 42:42.290
This is not good. I would like you to do like
this and this."

42:42.290 --> 42:49.580
So discipline doesn't mean, discipline doesn't
mean something very dominating of one person

42:49.580 --> 42:55.750
or two persons, but discipline means that
whatever we do has to be for the benevolence

42:55.750 --> 43:05.590
of your spirit and the spirit of others. That
is what is the Sahaj discipline where you

43:05.590 --> 43:12.330
do everything for the benevolence of others
and for the benevolence of your own ascent.

43:12.330 --> 43:18.530
Once you have established this idea of hita,
of this benevolence, you have known the life

43:18.530 --> 43:26.030
of Christ, life of Mohammed, life of all these
great people. Because what They have done

43:26.030 --> 43:32.780
is for the benevolence of the people. So I
would say now we have the left Vishuddhi and

43:32.780 --> 43:40.420
you know very well that left Vishuddhi is
the lightning, in the lightning. Now what

43:40.420 --> 43:50.270
is lightning? He just shouts and roars. So
a person who has got left Vishuddhi should

43:50.270 --> 44:00.849
actually become a person who can shout and
who can scream and who can, I should say,

44:00.849 --> 44:07.349
expose others as She did. In the same way,
you have to do it. In that you should not

44:07.349 --> 44:12.690
be afraid, you should not worry, and you should
not think "How can I do it after all?" But

44:12.690 --> 44:20.150
mostly the people who feel guilty is a type
which has lost his confidence and the ego

44:20.150 --> 44:25.790
has entered into the left side - it's a very
complicated situation.

44:25.790 --> 44:30.480
So we have to be on the lookout that we are
not guilty, it's very important. Guilty for

44:30.480 --> 44:37.400
this, guilty for that, it's just a myth. We
want to escape reality that's why we say we

44:37.400 --> 44:44.460
are guilty. So you have to face, face it,
your reality. Try to find out what's wrong

44:44.460 --> 44:50.359
with you and what's wrong with another person
and face it. That is much better than to just

44:50.359 --> 44:59.510
say, "Oh I feel very guilty," and sitting
down, because Vishnumaya is nothing but like

44:59.510 --> 45:11.260
an electricity and electricity exposes people,
she screams at people, shouts at people, she

45:11.260 --> 45:20.280
roars at people. So if you have a left Vishuddhi
then you have to use these methods. I would

45:20.280 --> 45:26.950
say a person who has an inferiority complex
should go to the sea and address the sea and

45:26.950 --> 45:30.820
tell, "I am the lord of the sea, I am this,
I am that!" loudly.

45:30.820 --> 45:32.369
Those people who cannot speak on the stage,
cannot come on the stage, they should go - also

45:32.369 --> 45:36.369
same way - when they try they'll become great
speakers. It will be a very good idea for

45:36.369 --> 45:48.599
you to go and just to give a big lecture and
with that big lecture you can always show

45:48.599 --> 45:54.619
that you are not suffering from any inferiority
complex but you are expressing yourself in

45:54.619 --> 46:03.670
a clear-cut way. So now you will see the power
of Shri Krishna is of the throat, of the right

46:03.670 --> 46:14.130
side, where what is the power He has got?
The power is that He is sweetness. He has

46:14.130 --> 46:20.270
the power of the shouting - or you can say
with which, the vocal chord as you call it.

46:20.270 --> 46:27.710
He is the power of the vocal chord but how
does He use His power is for sweetness is

46:27.710 --> 46:36.650
a contrast. And the same thing happens with
Vishnumaya too. Now Vishnumaya is the potential

46:36.650 --> 46:43.530
power in the, say, in the clouds, is a potential
one. But what She does is to scream, shout

46:43.530 --> 46:48.410
and show Her existence, that She exists.

46:48.410 --> 46:53.330
Now all these photographs that you get and
all these miraculous photographs you have

46:53.330 --> 46:57.849
been showing me are because of Vishnumaya.
She is the one, as electricity, She acts.

46:57.849 --> 47:06.800
And She is the one who manages all these things
very well. So though She is the sister of

47:06.800 --> 47:14.640
Shri Krishna She is in a way very much subtler
because She helps you in such a subtle manner.

47:14.640 --> 47:23.380
Now this mic [microphone] it has electricity
in it - you'll be surprised My vibrations

47:23.380 --> 47:28.099
are passing through this. It is bombarding
this and from here, they are going anywhere

47:28.099 --> 47:34.030
you want them to go. You can put a computer
on the other side and you can computerize

47:34.030 --> 47:42.160
Me. It is such a remarkable thing that the
one which is supposed to shout, scream and

47:42.160 --> 47:51.430
roar is the one which is on the left hand
side so that it exists in the people in a

47:51.430 --> 48:02.250
potential way. In the people who are feeling
guilty, who are suffering from inferiority

48:02.250 --> 48:10.640
complex, who are sly, who feel they are good
for nothing. She exists in them. See the contrast

48:10.640 --> 48:20.150
again. She exists in them that Her power,
She exists in a person, or expresses in a

48:20.150 --> 48:30.790
person who is not self confident. And then
She asserts Her power by which persons become

48:30.790 --> 48:39.349
self confident. This is how Her working comes
in and that is potentially within us also.

48:39.349 --> 48:45.940
So when we talk of Vishnumaya we have to know
that She is sitting down there. Any moment

48:45.940 --> 48:53.460
we decide, we can become great speakers, we
can expose people. We'll be like lightning,

48:53.460 --> 49:04.250
we can roar. But normally we are not. So it
gives balance to both sides of people. But

49:04.250 --> 49:08.320
in the center when you rise - the kundalini
rises - most of the people have their Vishuddhi

49:08.320 --> 49:16.599
caught up, most of the people. So they have
to either see that they are not guilty or

49:16.599 --> 49:22.490
they have to see that there is no shouting
- nothing - they are not aggressive in their

49:22.490 --> 49:30.540
shouts. And, plus, they have to see that they
are completely in balance with themselves.

49:30.540 --> 49:36.970
So they are in the central path by which they
become sweet, kind and nice.

49:36.970 --> 49:41.250
Now there are many people who artificially
become sweet. Artificially. They have to take

49:41.250 --> 49:49.460
out some money so they'll be extremely sweet
and nice. Such people are really going to

49:49.460 --> 49:56.500
go to hell because they are using the power
of Shri Krishna in a very absurd manner and

49:56.500 --> 50:02.630
for that, they cannot be spared. So those
who are artificially sweet are good for nothing.

50:02.630 --> 50:10.619
You have to be really sweet and kind if you
think of Him as the One who is Narayana, who

50:10.619 --> 50:23.700
is Shri Rama, who is Shri Krishna and who
is the Lord of your Vishuddhi.

50:23.700 --> 50:28.550
So we have to control, not to feel guilty
again, because there might be some people

50:28.550 --> 50:34.830
who might be feeling that "Mother is saying
to me." I'm not saying to anyone as such,

50:34.830 --> 50:38.880
it's a general talk. So what I'm saying is
that if you are a person who is a shouting

50:38.880 --> 50:45.099
type, please bring it round and keep it in
check and take rest, give rest to your throat.

50:45.099 --> 50:52.260
Some people are very happy if they are told
that "Today collector sahib is in rest." They

50:52.260 --> 51:00.160
said, "Permanently or for a short time?" Because
he's the one, if he's a shouting fellow, nobody

51:00.160 --> 51:07.520
wants to see him. No one likes any person
who shouts, no one likes. Even the nearest

51:07.520 --> 51:12.810
and dearest don't like it. Of course they
tolerate, is different, but they don't like

51:12.810 --> 51:16.540
it they don't want it.

51:16.540 --> 51:20.869
So for us it is important to understand that
our Vishuddhi is to be kept clear first of

51:20.869 --> 51:29.510
all we must have a beautiful heart, a very
clean heart, where there is a fragrance of

51:29.510 --> 51:38.270
Shri Krishna's melodious music. Unless and
until we have a beautiful, sweet music in

51:38.270 --> 51:47.099
our heart we can never be, never be good Sahaj
Yogis. I hope today's evening puja, though

51:47.099 --> 51:55.700
has been rather late, doesn't matter, will
help you to think about it, improving your

51:55.700 --> 52:04.220
Vishuddhi, working it out. And then to look
at the Viraat and find out what's wrong with

52:04.220 --> 52:14.940
you, get it corrected - which can be done
by anyone - and see that you just have a full

52:14.940 --> 52:21.260
idea about yourself, about your Vishuddhi.
And that's only possible, only again it's

52:21.260 --> 52:26.770
a vicious circle, if you have a good Vishuddhi.
If you don't have a good Vishuddhi you can

52:26.770 --> 52:32.280
never see yourself because at the Vishuddhi
point only, you become the witness.

52:32.280 --> 52:37.810
You are just a witness when you are at a Vishuddhi
point. So you have to be at the Vishuddhi

52:37.810 --> 52:45.310
a witness. If you have achieved the witness
nature then you can see in your Vishuddhi

52:45.310 --> 52:51.400
what's wrong with you, what's wrong with your
problems, with your atmosphere, everything,

52:51.400 --> 52:56.580
and you will end up here only thinking, "Oh,
this is the one that is wrong."

52:56.580 --> 53:03.230
So today, when we are worshipping Shri Krishna,
we should know that our Vishuddhis and our

53:03.230 --> 53:11.320
brain, because ultimately He becomes the brain,
Shri Krishna becomes the brain. That's what

53:11.320 --> 53:18.609
I told you that the fat of the stomach goes
in the brain. So Shri Narayana enters into

53:18.609 --> 53:28.339
the brain and becomes what we call as Viraat,
Akhbar. And when He becomes Akhbar, then He's

53:28.339 --> 53:40.740
the brain in the big macrocosm. He's the brain.
So people who worship Shri Krishna become

53:40.740 --> 53:50.050
brainy people without ego. Their brain develops
and they have no ego about it. Egoless intelligence,

53:50.050 --> 54:01.339
which I call as the pure intelligence, starts
manifesting.

54:01.339 --> 54:15.410
May God bless you all.

54:15.410 --> 54:29.040
After this puja now you know that I'm going
to Finland and you should see My itinerary.

54:29.040 --> 54:33.300
It's terrible. And from Finland to Moscow,
Moscow to India, India to Japan, and Japan

54:33.300 --> 54:39.869
to Los Angeles and Los Angeles to New Zealand,
New Zealand to Australia. So this will be

54:39.869 --> 54:48.480
like this everyday practically, I think. But
whatever it is I'm going now and now you have

54:48.480 --> 54:57.970
some time. We have lot of time now in between
till I come in October to trouble you again.

54:57.970 --> 55:04.320
So in this time you all should decide what
you are going to do, how are you going to

55:04.320 --> 55:12.200
help Sahaja Yoga, how you are going to work
it out. This is very important because I don't

55:12.200 --> 55:17.430
need any Sahaja Yog, you need it and all the
rest of the world needs it. But despite that

55:17.430 --> 55:21.609
I'm working so hard. So you have to think
that "Mother is now gone out, doesn't matter.

55:21.609 --> 55:26.609
We are going to work it out and we are going
to find out what we can do about it."

55:26.609 --> 55:32.520
So please work out something till I come back.
I'll be back here again in October, then we'll

55:32.520 --> 55:40.900
see what we can do and achieve further. But
let's see what you have achieved and bring

55:40.900 --> 55:47.950
them to some conclusions, bring them to some
fruits. And that is what I'm expecting.

55:47.950 --> 55:55.740
Now I have to thank all the people who have
done so much for Sahaja Yoga already and all

55:55.740 --> 56:02.430
the centers and all the countries where Sahaja
Yoga started and is growing so much. I don't

56:02.430 --> 56:08.300
know if you know the names of all the leaders
or not, but it is worth knowing all the leaders

56:08.300 --> 56:18.700
of all the countries and paying your attention
to them and praying that they should be able

56:18.700 --> 56:31.780
to deliver blessings of Sahaja Yoga to everyone.
Also they should be able to have visions,

56:31.780 --> 56:37.359
to see what they can do and how they can combine
different countries and how they can work

56:37.359 --> 56:38.970
out through their own countries.

56:38.970 --> 56:45.660
So this is what it is and I have to thank
all the leaders of the world and all the people

56:45.660 --> 56:55.369
wherever I have been so far, for the arrangements
and everything they did. They worked very

56:55.369 --> 57:01.270
hard and achieved such a lot of things. And
I have to thank also the Sahaja Yogis who

57:01.270 --> 57:09.079
are with them, who have helped so much. Thank
you very much, all of you.

57:10.040 --> 57:18.339
All right. In today's puja we'll have first
a Shri Ganesha's three mantras and then we'll

57:18.339 --> 57:26.900
have hundred and eight names of Shri Krishna
- if they have. Have

57:26.900 --> 01:01:02.720
you got hundred and eight names of Shri Krishna?
Just wash My feet. Need not call the children now, it's very late.
