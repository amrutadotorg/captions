00:00.900 --> 00:04.980
You see, in Sahaja Yoga, you are not given
any mantra or anything.

00:04.980 --> 00:09.660
There’s no, nothing like giving you into
a big course, like teaching you one after

00:09.660 --> 00:12.870
another any mantra, or anything, it’s not
like that.

00:12.870 --> 00:18.210
What you have to know: where the Kundalini
is, how it is moving, where it is, what is

00:18.210 --> 00:21.099
the charka catching and what is the mantra
for that.

00:21.099 --> 00:25.300
It doesn’t take anything, hardly it takes
about a week for you to understand the all

00:25.300 --> 00:26.300
thing.

00:26.300 --> 00:29.840
But gradually, as you start using it, you
become proficient and you how to do it for

00:29.840 --> 00:31.499
yourself and for others.

00:31.499 --> 00:38.840
There is not much of a thing- like a child,
when he comes up a little age, he starts speaking

00:38.840 --> 00:43.140
up language, because he has a built-in capacity
to create sounds.

00:43.140 --> 00:45.390
And he does it.

00:45.390 --> 00:50.610
In the same way, once you get it, when you
get the cool breeze in you hand, you learn

00:50.610 --> 00:57.330
it by using it, you understand it yourself,
you become yourself quite proficient.

00:57.330 --> 01:00.750
And you will be amazed how fast you learn
this.

01:00.750 --> 01:05.800
You don’t have to learn it just like a science
book or anything, you just start learning,

01:05.800 --> 01:09.590
you can: this is charka which is catching
because now, say, for example, this charka

01:09.590 --> 01:11.100
is catching [fore finger], right side.

01:11.100 --> 01:13.870
Now, there’s a mantra for this is of Shri
Krishna.

01:13.870 --> 01:20.740
Say, this charka is catching [forehead], here,
then there’s a mantra of Jesus Christ.

01:20.740 --> 01:24.200
Like that, you must know the mantras and the
charkas.

01:24.200 --> 01:30.270
But the charkas you just know as a, absolutely,
a knowledge which is built-in your nerves:

01:30.270 --> 01:33.130
you just feel it.

01:33.130 --> 01:35.880
This is- now this gentleman is saying: ” it’s
hot here” [left palm].

01:35.880 --> 01:36.880
Alright, what is that?

01:36.880 --> 01:38.110
Hot here means what?

01:38.110 --> 01:40.460
That’s the Sahasrara, at the left side.

01:40.460 --> 01:43.110
First it was, the Sahasrara on the right side.

01:43.110 --> 01:45.060
Now, on the left side it’s there.

01:45.060 --> 01:48.450
So that means there’s a mantra for that,
and that one must be used.

01:48.450 --> 01:52.049
If you use that mantra, this will be cleared
out.

01:52.049 --> 01:53.049
Alright?

01:53.049 --> 01:54.560
That is how you have to know.

01:54.560 --> 01:59.970
And that’s why I said it takes time for
people sometimes to establish, because first

01:59.970 --> 02:02.110
you have to know it and then use it.

02:02.110 --> 02:03.690
Shri Mataji: Come along.

02:03.690 --> 02:06.210
Have you come for the first time?

02:06.210 --> 02:09.799
Seeker: [Inaudible]
Shri Mataji: All right, come along.

02:09.799 --> 02:11.590
Come along this side.

02:11.590 --> 02:17.769
Shri Mataji: So, it is not a difficult thing,
it is not at all a difficult thing to learn

02:17.769 --> 02:18.849
it, it’s very easy.

02:18.849 --> 02:23.739
You can pick it up in no time, as soon as
you start using your hands on other people.

02:23.739 --> 02:27.069
Shri Mataji: Please, be seated.

02:27.069 --> 02:28.069
Alright.

02:28.069 --> 02:33.599
[To a Yogi] Just see them, some people come
along.

02:33.599 --> 02:36.409
Now these people, say- who are the latest
who have come to Sahaja Yoga?

02:36.409 --> 02:37.409
Let’s see.

02:37.409 --> 02:38.930
The latest ones.

02:38.930 --> 02:43.370
Say, those who have come about a month back.

02:43.370 --> 02:44.639
Seeker: Yes.

02:44.639 --> 02:48.719
Shri Mataji: See, he came back, she came back
only one month back.

02:48.719 --> 02:49.719
And.

02:49.719 --> 02:51.200
Sahaja Yogini: This is his first time.

02:51.200 --> 02:53.060
Seeker: I was here on Monday.

02:53.060 --> 02:54.299
Shri Mataji: How much?

02:54.299 --> 02:55.299
Sahaja Yogini: Ah.

02:55.299 --> 02:57.090
Ok, he was here on Monday.

02:57.090 --> 02:58.329
Shri Mataji: Monday, alright.

02:58.329 --> 02:59.329
He’s got it.

02:59.329 --> 03:02.069
But you see, [to someone else] Have you been
giving vibrations now?

03:02.069 --> 03:03.170
Lady: Yes.

03:03.170 --> 03:08.069
Shri Mataji: In one month, it’s done.

03:08.069 --> 03:09.529
So you can imagine.

03:09.529 --> 03:11.120
And you know about the charkas now?

03:11.120 --> 03:12.120
Lady: Yes.

03:12.120 --> 03:13.120
Shri Mataji: About the mantras?

03:13.120 --> 03:14.120
Lady: Yes.

03:14.120 --> 03:15.120
Not all of them.

03:15.120 --> 03:17.659
Shri Mataji: Yes, you see, that’s it.

03:17.659 --> 03:20.879
It’s very simple.

03:20.879 --> 03:25.650
If you pay attention to it, you can do it
much faster.

03:25.650 --> 03:30.139
There are many people who are here, within
a month, one month’s time, they pick up

03:30.139 --> 03:32.930
so many things.

03:32.930 --> 03:35.739
Many like that, within one month‘s time.

03:35.739 --> 03:39.970
[To a Sahaja Yogi:] He’s alright.

03:39.970 --> 03:41.939
Because you become the knowledge.

03:41.939 --> 03:44.930
You start feeling it on your fingers, you
know this is the charka.

03:44.930 --> 03:49.290
If this finger is, say, burning, [left auricular]
that means your left heart is catching.

03:49.290 --> 03:52.120
If your left heart is catching, then you know
because it’s burning!

03:52.120 --> 03:55.950
Then, there’s nothing to go to the books
or anything to find out, it’s just burning,

03:55.950 --> 03:57.109
it’s there.

03:57.109 --> 03:58.269
Isn’t it?

03:58.269 --> 03:59.629
That means the left heart is catching.

03:59.629 --> 04:03.719
Now, only you have to know what [Inaudible]
left heart is catching, the decoding only,

04:03.719 --> 04:05.019
what does that mean.

04:05.019 --> 04:07.920
Your hands will speak Christ has said, alright?

04:07.920 --> 04:10.079
They will speak, I am just recording it.

04:10.079 --> 04:12.500
Now you see for self if it’s true or not.

04:12.500 --> 04:14.269
What does that mean?

04:14.269 --> 04:20.130
Left heart means there’s a problem on the
heart: may be, the person is over hard working,

04:20.130 --> 04:22.100
he has forgotten about his Spirit.

04:22.100 --> 04:29.410
The mantra you have to say is: “I am the
Spirit”, for left heart.

04:29.410 --> 04:31.430
It’s so simple.

04:31.430 --> 04:35.970
Because you have forgotten about your Spirit,
you are more on the right side in the sense,

04:35.970 --> 04:42.830
you are more extra- you are an extravert and
more attention is outside, not towards your

04:42.830 --> 04:43.830
Spirit.

04:43.830 --> 04:47.340
Left heart is catching.

04:47.340 --> 04:54.539
You start understanding Sahaja Yoga so well
when your vibrations are steady.

04:54.539 --> 04:57.460
Now this finger, this is catching [left thumb].

04:57.460 --> 05:03.849
Now this is catching means the person has
been to somebody who s unauthorized in spiritual

05:03.849 --> 05:04.849
life.

05:04.849 --> 05:07.259
Anything, say ISP, you call it IST.

05:07.259 --> 05:11.010
Then you have got parapsychology, even psychology.

05:11.010 --> 05:15.070
Then you have got other things like all these
gurus, false gurus, you can say this aura

05:15.070 --> 05:18.550
business- what else is there, just now he
was telling.

05:18.550 --> 05:19.550
Sahaja Yogini: Supernatural, Mother.

05:19.550 --> 05:23.289
Shri Mataji: Supernatural and under-natural,
and [Big laugh].

05:23.289 --> 05:28.800
All these things, you know, all alternatives
you can think of.

05:28.800 --> 05:33.949
Anything you can think of, all these things
and the books, and the Lams and the Dhamas,

05:33.949 --> 05:36.470
and every thing.

05:36.470 --> 05:37.580
[Laugh].

05:37.580 --> 05:43.759
Even people who go, sort of adhere to a chuch
too much, or adhere to Catholicism again.

05:43.759 --> 05:47.240
Because they are not connected with God and
they are unauthorized.

05:47.240 --> 05:48.490
[Shri Mataji shows her left palm].

05:48.490 --> 05:52.150
But if you have been to a real guru, then
immediately I will know.

05:52.150 --> 05:56.300
You won’t have this problem and ascent will
be very fast if you have been to a real guru.

05:56.300 --> 05:57.659
But how many are real these days?

05:57.659 --> 06:02.949
In the market, only those who are marketing
are they, as I said it: in the market only

06:02.949 --> 06:05.260
the buyers and the shopkeepers.

06:05.260 --> 06:08.330
It’s a market place now!

06:08.330 --> 06:13.180
So the real gurus are not to be seen, there
are, of course I know, there are many real

06:13.180 --> 06:17.050
gurus also, but wherever they are, they are
not in the market.

06:17.050 --> 06:20.759
I am the only person fighting them and telling
them off, you see.

06:20.759 --> 06:24.520
None of them are willing to come down or to
concede to anything, they said these human

06:24.520 --> 06:25.520
beings are hopeless.

06:25.520 --> 06:29.919
They said: ” twelve years you work Mother,
then we’ll come down “. They want me alone

06:29.919 --> 06:30.940
to fight the [ordeal?]

06:30.940 --> 06:32.890
[Shri Mataji laughs] doesn’t matter.

06:32.890 --> 06:39.520
So now, it’s a market place, where there
are buyers and they are simple naïve customers.

06:39.520 --> 06:49.660
They just put such absurd things like somebody
says: “alright, I want to sell a big palace,

06:49.660 --> 06:55.599
with this and that, and all that, only you
have to deposit 2 thousand pounds.”

06:55.599 --> 07:01.349
Alright, people will be quite willing to do:
“Oh, what a bargain, let’s pay 2 thousands.”

07:01.349 --> 07:04.599
And the palace may belong to the Queen.

07:04.599 --> 07:07.469
If you go there and ask them: “which palace
you want to sell?”

07:07.469 --> 07:08.469
“This palace.

07:08.469 --> 07:10.919
” And that belongs to the Queen, you see.

07:10.919 --> 07:13.009
This is unauthorized.

07:13.009 --> 07:19.710
Unauthorized people who have nothing to do
with God, who claim that they have something

07:19.710 --> 07:25.129
to do with God, which is false, and that’s
why they catch on this finger [left thumb].

07:25.129 --> 07:27.129
And what do they do?

07:27.129 --> 07:33.919
They use all these techniques; these techniques
are called, in Sanskrit language, as “avidya”.

07:33.919 --> 07:42.030
” Avidya” means, non-knowledge, you can
say that it’s not knowledge, something anti-knowledge,

07:42.030 --> 07:44.240
anti-God, this is anti-God.

07:44.240 --> 07:50.229
So for that the mantra is: “Shuddha vidya”,
means the pure technique.

07:50.229 --> 07:56.370
It’s the mantra : pure technique, it’s
the mantra.

07:56.370 --> 08:01.770
“Pure” means the one that comes from the
Spirit.

08:01.770 --> 08:04.389
Now what they are doing [The Sahaja Yogis]
is the pure technique because it’s flowing

08:04.389 --> 08:05.389
in them.

08:05.389 --> 08:08.629
If they are moving their hands, there’s
a power flowing through them and they are

08:08.629 --> 08:09.879
working it out.

08:09.879 --> 08:14.249
It’s not just a, acrobatic thing that is
going on.

08:14.249 --> 08:19.860
So the pure knowledge: for example, the way
they are raising theses candles now in my

08:19.860 --> 08:24.229
presence, and they themselves are Realized
souls, it’s working out.

08:24.229 --> 08:29.580
So this is all, it’ the pure “vidya”
it’s the pure knowledge and the pure technique,

08:29.580 --> 08:34.900
and those who have not done this, have gone
to such people, they have put their heads

08:34.900 --> 08:40.950
before them, kneeled before them, have done
something that should not have been done!

08:40.950 --> 08:42.190
So this is it.

08:42.190 --> 08:47.090
And that’s how if you catch on this finger,
this thumb, left hand, that means a person

08:47.090 --> 08:48.880
has been to somebody like that.

08:48.880 --> 08:54.540
But, with that, if you have any catch on this
Void [on the palm], or Void here in the stomach

08:54.540 --> 08:59.090
part- this is left Swaddithana, it’s placed
here down below, which moves like that all

08:59.090 --> 09:02.350
over, and this becomes right Swaddisthana,
this side.

09:02.350 --> 09:07.340
Now supposing a person catches all round here,
his Void, and all round here.

09:07.340 --> 09:08.680
Seeker: How do you call it?

09:08.680 --> 09:12.190
Shri Mataji: It’s called as the Void, we
call it Void.

09:12.190 --> 09:13.580
It’s not the Zen Void.

09:13.580 --> 09:19.430
But the Void is the crossing point which is,
it’s the viscera, it’s the stomach part,

09:19.430 --> 09:25.870
where-abdomen you can call it, abdomen part
– and this part, if it is catching that

09:25.870 --> 09:33.230
means these are the ten principles of the
guru.

09:33.230 --> 09:43.220
If this is catching, means you have hurt your
principle of guru, your principle of a master.

09:43.220 --> 09:45.700
That means you have gone to some very wrong
master.

09:45.700 --> 09:48.130
If this is catching, that means that.

09:48.130 --> 09:50.620
Now, just now as they said, his Void is catching.

09:50.620 --> 09:54.010
The Kundalini will be wobbling there, you
can see it with your own eyes also.

09:54.010 --> 10:00.630
You can see the Kundalini just potting [?] – pulsating
there, you can see the all stomach going into

10:00.630 --> 10:02.480
a trauma.

10:02.480 --> 10:06.320
And then you have to say the mantra of the
Primordial master.

10:06.320 --> 10:10.740
Anyone you can do it you see, Guru Nanaka’s
name you can take, Muhammad’s name you can

10:10.740 --> 10:12.340
take, all of them are Prophets.

10:12.340 --> 10:15.260
Moses’ name, Abraham, all these are there.

10:15.260 --> 10:19.480
So if you take their names, the Kundalini
can be brought up.

10:19.480 --> 10:24.580
You can strengthen that part, then the Kundalini’s
pushed up.

10:24.580 --> 10:28.920
So all these so-called Yogas, also like physical
yoga.

10:28.920 --> 10:33.770
Now, in the physical Yoga, you will catch
this finger [right annular], this one [right

10:33.770 --> 10:36.490
major] and this finger [left auricular].

10:36.490 --> 10:40.830
This ring finger here and this finger [left
auricular].

10:40.830 --> 10:45.660
This is heart, means you have been paying
too much attention to your physical thing.

10:45.660 --> 10:50.080
Anybody who is working also physically too
much can also catch this, plus this [right

10:50.080 --> 10:51.080
annular].

10:51.080 --> 10:56.900
Because when you go into action too much,
also, as a result of that, the fumes or your

10:56.900 --> 10:58.170
actions create your ego.

10:58.170 --> 11:01.700
And this is one of the biggest problem of
the West you see, they are not aware that

11:01.700 --> 11:02.970
they have an ego.

11:02.970 --> 11:06.050
But after Realization they start seeing the
ballon [floating?] like that [Shri Mataji

11:06.050 --> 11:10.440
laughs], they see that and then they come
and tell me: “Mother I ‘m catching on

11:10.440 --> 11:11.990
my right Agnya” [right side].

11:11.990 --> 11:13.540
It’s a very delicate stuff.

11:13.540 --> 11:15.270
You can’t tell anybody: “You have got
ego”.

11:15.270 --> 11:17.070
They [do really?] have it, you see.

11:17.070 --> 11:20.080
So you have to be very careful when you are
talking to them.

11:20.080 --> 11:25.570
But actually, so many people felt that there
is ego in them, so they took to- even people,

11:25.570 --> 11:29.330
when they feel they have too much ego they
take to alcoholism, because they are frightened

11:29.330 --> 11:32.680
of themselves, they can’t just bear, they
want to escape that part.

11:32.680 --> 11:34.430
So people are quite conscious.

11:34.430 --> 11:39.900
But after Realization, it becomes a complete
understanding because you start feeling a

11:39.900 --> 11:43.770
little pain sometimes, in this finger [right
annular], you feel a pain here and you know

11:43.770 --> 11:46.210
that you have got this Mister ego just coming
out.

11:46.210 --> 11:51.290
So then you know how to twist it and take
it out, how to bring it out.

11:51.290 --> 11:56.010
So you start understanding yourself and you
start understanding others.

11:56.010 --> 12:00.880
I don’t have to tell you, you know yourself.

12:00.880 --> 12:07.420
Now we have certain things, like we use vibrated
water for clearing your Void.

12:07.420 --> 12:08.850
Now what is vibrated water?

12:08.850 --> 12:12.770
It’s nothing that- but these divine vibrations
are put into it.

12:12.770 --> 12:19.060
And they go and start bombarding that area
and try to improve it.

12:19.060 --> 12:23.510
We have cured so many people of stomach cancers
and all those things with it.

12:23.510 --> 12:28.390
Even, we can cure what you call blood cancers
something with Sahaja Yoga, so many have been

12:28.390 --> 12:29.390
cured.

12:29.390 --> 12:35.200
You can cure, you can do it, no problem, you
can do it, but, what one has to do [is] to

12:35.200 --> 12:39.030
be steadily moving about with Sahaja Yoga.

12:39.030 --> 12:43.400
Now for example, you have a conception about
Christ, say for example.

12:43.400 --> 12:48.590
Now, that conception my not be the real conception
of Christ, may not be, may be.

12:48.590 --> 12:50.910
So keep your eyes opened.

12:50.910 --> 12:53.890
Now what I say in Sahaja Yoga, you can verify
it.

12:53.890 --> 12:56.440
But do not deny, first verify.

12:56.440 --> 13:00.830
Supposing you go as a scientist, you have
to go and see for yourself, isn’t it?

13:00.830 --> 13:04.960
You just deny [?]”no this cannot be true.”

13:04.960 --> 13:07.530
Because whatever you know is your own conception.

13:07.530 --> 13:08.610
Get inside alright.

13:08.610 --> 13:17.120
Now when you get inside, keep you eyes opened
and see for yourself.

13:17.120 --> 13:22.040
And then, once you start seeing it, that’s
the best way, is knowing, because what you

13:22.040 --> 13:23.950
see is trough your vibrated awareness.

13:23.950 --> 13:33.350
For example, now you want to ask a question,
say, Mother is there God?

13:33.350 --> 13:38.140
Just ask a question thrice and you’ll find
the vibrations will increase.

13:38.140 --> 13:39.610
It’s a fact.

13:39.610 --> 13:44.550
But if you ask about T.M., you may get even
burning.

13:44.550 --> 13:45.550
Vibrations will stop.

13:45.550 --> 13:46.940
Better ask about God, so that we have vibrations.
