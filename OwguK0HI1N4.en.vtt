00:01:48.605 --> 00:01:51.288
Please, be seated.

00:02:33.097 --> 00:02:45.683
It is so very beautiful to be in such
natural surroundings with you all.

00:02:47.921 --> 00:02:57.589
In the hubbub of the city, you don’t find
this peace,

00:02:58.814 --> 00:03:06.190
and it’s very good for all those who are
seeking their ascent.

00:03:08.993 --> 00:03:13.292
You all asked Me to come for this Ganesha
Puja.

00:03:13.493 --> 00:03:20.399
I thought it was essential that Shri
Ganesha should be established,

00:03:22.338 --> 00:03:30.883
and I am so very happy that there are so
many Americans now who are Sahaja Yogis.

00:03:31.148 --> 00:03:39.593
Of course, compared to the population
of America they are very few,

00:03:39.794 --> 00:03:43.138
and we have to have many more.

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:49.604
But they have basic problems, and one
of them I think is of Shri Ganesh;

00:03:49.805 --> 00:03:56.951
and that’s why it was necessary to have
this Shri Ganesha’s Puja

00:03:57.152 --> 00:04:04.178
in Los Angeles - or you may call whichever
places this one is, San Diego,

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:15.067
or on this mountain - which I hope so,
will be able to establish

00:04:15.268 --> 00:04:24.553
that essence of innocence which is so much
in a sleeping state.

00:04:30.891 --> 00:04:37.412
Today I just wanted to tell you few things

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:44.721
as to how we should deal with the people
who come around.

00:04:47.097 --> 00:04:55.535
The idea that we should deal with
the seekers who are coming to see us,

00:04:55.736 --> 00:05:07.592
is that we should try to be little
apologetic

00:05:07.793 --> 00:05:12.626
and to tell them about all chakras,

00:05:13.093 --> 00:05:21.971
give them a feedback, as they call it,
on the mental level.

00:05:23.453 --> 00:05:28.243
But I do not think that’s a very good
style.

00:05:29.293 --> 00:05:35.735
You have to first give them the experience
of realisation,

00:05:38.015 --> 00:05:43.344
and tell them that this is not any gurudom

00:05:43.545 --> 00:05:53.922
or any such false hocus-pocus as they
call it - nonsense here,

00:05:54.137 --> 00:06:02.453
but is the evolutionary process

00:06:02.654 --> 00:06:11.071
which is a natural progressive
manifestation

00:06:11.272 --> 00:06:15.700
of the power within us.

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:22.342
And you have to tell about Me!

00:06:22.854 --> 00:06:36.835
We have tried not to talk about Me and we
have tried to avoid the topic.

00:06:37.227 --> 00:06:43.056
Perhaps because you think that there have
been gurus and this and that,

00:06:43.257 --> 00:06:48.521
and the gurus have brought a bad name.
It’s not so!

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:54.084
Even now people are going to those gurus
in very large number,

00:06:54.285 --> 00:07:02.219
and they start claiming they are semi-gods,
demi-gods or gods or whatever it is.

00:07:02.522 --> 00:07:07.224
So this kind of an apologetic attitude will
not convince them.

00:07:07.425 --> 00:07:11.275
You have to give them experience and say
that this is the One

00:07:11.476 --> 00:07:15.001
whose grace has worked on you.

00:07:16.361 --> 00:07:25.289
Psychologically you’ll be amazed - it
always works the other way round.

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:29.335
Supposing tomorrow you arrange My program
[in] San Diego,

00:07:29.536 --> 00:07:33.385
we can easily get three hundred people.

00:07:33.625 --> 00:07:38.312
But when you want to have a follow-on,
they don’t want to come.

00:07:42.771 --> 00:07:46.224
Or when you have workshop, if I am there
there are so many,

00:07:46.425 --> 00:07:50.546
and then they are not interested in seeing
you.

00:07:53.803 --> 00:07:59.505
So the reason for such a behaviour is
only one,

00:07:59.753 --> 00:08:03.597
that they don’t want to go through all that
mental occupation

00:08:03.798 --> 00:08:11.553
and mental acrobats that you want
to tell them.

00:08:12.942 --> 00:08:18.002
As they want to feel Me in a meeting,

00:08:18.203 --> 00:08:22.859
they want to feel Me through you people.

00:08:25.665 --> 00:08:29.846
And I think you must change your tactics.

00:08:30.047 --> 00:08:34.889
In a simple natural way, tell them that,
«We were seekers,

00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:39.323
we went to many gurus, we never found it.

00:08:39.524 --> 00:08:46.077
We were cheated. Here is somebody who
doesn’t take any money,

00:08:47.737 --> 00:08:55.176
doesn’t want anything, doesn’t make you
abnormal, you lead a very normal life,

00:08:55.377 --> 00:09:00.041
and gives you all kinds of blessings,
try that.

00:09:00.599 --> 00:09:05.093
If you don’t want to experience it, you
need not».

00:09:05.523 --> 00:09:11.791
You see, it is like a person who is not
a realized soul.

00:09:11.992 --> 00:09:14.628
He says, “I must fight my ego.”

00:09:14.829 --> 00:09:18.424
But with what do you fight? It’s your
own ego.

00:09:18.625 --> 00:09:22.039
So you add to your ego.

00:09:22.279 --> 00:09:29.316
In the same way, when you go on pampering
these people, you add to their ego,

00:09:29.517 --> 00:09:35.868
and they become hard-boiled eggs actually,
impossible to penetrate.

00:09:36.449 --> 00:09:45.482
So your devotion, dedication to Me will
prove the results, no way out.

00:09:45.683 --> 00:09:52.286
If you talk to them directly, they wouldn’t
listen to you. That’s human nature.

00:09:52.487 --> 00:09:55.901
You can’t help it. How do you explain

00:09:56.102 --> 00:10:03.475
that when I come and give a lecture
in any place, there are so many?

00:10:03.676 --> 00:10:08.409
Because they think I am authentic, I speak
with authority,

00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:15.380
not with aggressiveness, but with
conviction and with a character.

00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:21.934
That conviction has to be expressed.

00:10:22.144 --> 00:10:24.041
On the contrary, when you start telling
them

00:10:24.242 --> 00:10:25.673
there is a chakra, this thing, that thing,
they say,

00:10:25.874 --> 00:10:30.997
“All right, we can read a book. Why do we
need these headaches?”

00:10:33.505 --> 00:10:41.978
So you should be people of conviction,
not of falsehood, but of reality.

00:10:42.179 --> 00:10:45.869
I must say today because you are all here,

00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:50.923
we have got some very good Sahaja Yogis
from India for you.

00:10:51.124 --> 00:10:57.156
But I don’t know how far you listen
to them. Like we have got Mr Kharde.

00:10:57.357 --> 00:11:01.973
He is the man who started Sangamner,
and those who have been to Sangamner

00:11:02.174 --> 00:11:17.771
have seen that a complete big gymnasium,
like a huge big football area,

00:11:17.972 --> 00:11:23.905
was covered by the people who came
down in Sangamner.

00:11:24.106 --> 00:11:33.877
And he has really established this
Sangamner city

00:11:34.228 --> 00:11:39.057
into a beautiful centre.

00:11:40.638 --> 00:11:44.040
But you have to listen to him;

00:11:47.493 --> 00:11:51.092
otherwise, they are useless.

00:11:51.848 --> 00:11:55.866
Secondly, Cheryl Worker is a very good
Sahaja Yogini.

00:11:56.067 --> 00:12:00.381
Apart from anything, she is very
auspicious, knowledgeable.

00:12:00.582 --> 00:12:04.975
Knowledge of Sahaja Yoga is not the way
you understand.

00:12:05.176 --> 00:12:11.807
It’s not the knowledge of chakras.
It’s the knowledge of attitudes.

00:12:13.054 --> 00:12:18.105
It’s not the knowledge of any system.
We don’t want to have systems,

00:12:18.321 --> 00:12:25.454
because every system creates a bondage,
a kind of a slavery.

00:12:25.947 --> 00:12:28.837
We have to develop attitudes within us

00:12:29.022 --> 00:12:36.233
which attitudes are tried and tested
on experience.

00:12:36.908 --> 00:12:45.748
So it is not what you can talk elaborately
about chakras and things is important,

00:12:45.957 --> 00:12:54.189
but it is what you express your personality

00:12:54.934 --> 00:12:58.893
in your attitudes towards things.

00:13:00.869 --> 00:13:05.123
All kinds of systems are built up and
especially in the West

00:13:05.324 --> 00:13:10.808
is a common habit to form a system.
Some sort of a norm is to be formed.

00:13:11.009 --> 00:13:18.246
For example, a system will be built up:
we eat our food like this.

00:13:18.447 --> 00:13:22.416
All right, then everybody starts eating
the same way.

00:13:22.617 --> 00:13:27.692
Or they built up a system long time back,
say, have tailcoats for dinners.

00:13:27.893 --> 00:13:32.279
For dinner, you must change your dress.
Morning another dress.

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:35.918
Then people got fed up with it. They said,
“This is no good.”

00:13:36.119 --> 00:13:40.655
So they started anti-culture. So the anti-
culture started,

00:13:40.869 --> 00:13:47.716
with that they started hippies. Now hippies
also had their system.

00:13:47.917 --> 00:13:51.188
To be a hippie you had to wear a dress like
that, you had to be dirty,

00:13:51.389 --> 00:13:56.066
you had to have hair like that, you had
to move in a particular fashion.

00:13:56.267 --> 00:13:58.760
Again another system was built in.

00:13:58.983 --> 00:14:03.220
When they broke that system, then another.
Now a punk system has come.

00:14:03.421 --> 00:14:06.379
Now that punk business is you have to have
a dress like this,

00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:10.331
you have to have a particular type
of a hairdress for which

00:14:10.532 --> 00:14:13.959
you have to spend so much money; otherwise,
you are not a punk.

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:17.946
So when they try to break also any systems,
they fall into another system.

00:14:18.147 --> 00:14:23.962
And go on following systems and systems
from one dead to another dead.

00:14:24.438 --> 00:14:29.736
But the attitude is the same. Attitude
doesn’t change.

00:14:29.937 --> 00:14:34.219
I have seen the hippies when they became
anti-culture,

00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:39.391
they started behaving in such a funny
manner that there was no change at all.

00:14:39.592 --> 00:14:45.429
They became very arrogant, without any
self-respect.

00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:49.951
Then came these punks. They are just
the same.

00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:56.257
So the change in your attitude is the main
transformation that takes place.

00:14:56.458 --> 00:15:00.336
Your priorities change absolutely.

00:15:01.695 --> 00:15:06.105
So we should not form a system.

00:15:08.105 --> 00:15:14.586
As I told you last night, you should not
say that eight hours meditation,

00:15:14.787 --> 00:15:18.972
nothing of the kind. Eight minutes are
sufficient.

00:15:19.244 --> 00:15:22.746
It’s the attitude that is going to help
your growth,

00:15:22.947 --> 00:15:27.560
not you are sitting for eight hours
on one leg or something like that.

00:15:27.761 --> 00:15:31.049
There are some sadhus who just stand up
and put one leg like this

00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:34.425
and they said, “We are sitting on one leg”.

00:15:34.626 --> 00:15:37.149
That’s not going to help! It’s a living
process,

00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:41.312
and a living process has to be worked out
in a living way.

00:15:41.513 --> 00:15:46.337
Allow it to work out. Allow it to grow.

00:15:46.538 --> 00:15:50.245
So the whole attitude should be changed.

00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:53.844
And when you start finding your attitude

00:15:54.045 --> 00:15:56.855
towards life is changing, then you must
realize... [interruption].

00:15:57.056 --> 00:16:04.151
...who wants to get his realisation, you
better do it.

00:16:04.352 --> 00:16:10.356
I think we have not yet touched those shores
where there are real seekers existing.

00:16:10.557 --> 00:16:13.750
That’s why we are getting very, very few
people.

00:16:13.911 --> 00:16:25.803
Like when the fishermen are taking their
trawlers on the waves of the seas,

00:16:26.004 --> 00:16:30.902
they know where there are shoals of fishes

00:16:31.103 --> 00:16:36.481
and they direct their trawlers to those
places and catch fishes.

00:16:36.682 --> 00:16:44.426
In the same way, we must also, first
of all, find out where are those seekers,

00:16:44.627 --> 00:16:52.601
where we can direct our attention and
our efforts.

00:16:52.802 --> 00:16:59.717
Like in [audio interruption] ...you will see
you will get [the] right type of people.

00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:06.865
In Calcutta, when I went there, there is
one Mr Jalan

00:17:07.066 --> 00:17:12.853
who is a very wise businessman. He came
to Sahaja Yoga.

00:17:13.411 --> 00:17:21.252
He sent letters to all the eminent people
whom he thought would be seeking,

00:17:21.453 --> 00:17:29.082
and he said he would like to go and meet
them, or they can come and see him.

00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:34.093
Out of all these letters, there were few
people, of course,

00:17:34.294 --> 00:17:38.769
who answered and wanted to meet him.

00:17:39.113 --> 00:17:42.758
That’s how he met some very important
people.

00:17:42.959 --> 00:17:48.534
Then he told them what is Sahaja Yoga,
talked to them.

00:17:48.735 --> 00:17:53.571
And when I went there, he made Me meet
them.

00:17:54.406 --> 00:18:07.006
One of them was an editor of a big
newspaper who came to see Me.

00:18:07.207 --> 00:18:13.140
And he saw Me, how I was treating people
and how I was looking after them,

00:18:13.341 --> 00:18:16.778
and he wrote a beautiful article

00:18:17.396 --> 00:18:20.522
and he said, “Mother, tomorrow I will
come to the program.”

00:18:20.723 --> 00:18:24.191
He came, he gave a very beautiful
introduction

00:18:24.392 --> 00:18:28.541
and the whole thing started on a different
line.

00:18:32.162 --> 00:18:38.480
I can tell you about Italy. There’s one
lady called Alganesh.

00:18:38.966 --> 00:18:42.477
She went and saw somebody whom she
thought was a seeker

00:18:42.678 --> 00:18:50.396
and he is a Director in the Broadcasting
in Italy, the Government Broadcasting.

00:18:50.597 --> 00:18:53.100
And he is a television man.

00:18:53.276 --> 00:18:58.373
She told him that, «You can get your
realization».

00:18:58.574 --> 00:19:01.073
When I went and saw him, he said, “First
give me realization,

00:19:01.274 --> 00:19:04.627
then I’ll take Your interview.” I said,
“He is the man!”

00:19:04.828 --> 00:19:08.702
And I paid all My attention to him, I gave
him realization.

00:19:08.895 --> 00:19:12.754
Also he had some experiences.

00:19:12.955 --> 00:19:19.588
And then he just wholeheartedly came out
as a big Sahaja Yogi

00:19:19.789 --> 00:19:25.020
and now in Italy, Sahaja Yoga is spreading
very fast.

00:19:25.222 --> 00:19:27.802
So you should not go about picking up some
beggars

00:19:28.003 --> 00:19:32.034
on the street, “Please come to Sahaja Yoga.
Please come to Sahaja Yoga”.

00:19:32.235 --> 00:19:35.957
What are they going to do? They are just
liabilities.

00:19:36.158 --> 00:19:39.520
What are they going to help us?

00:19:40.976 --> 00:19:46.008
I am not saying that we should go after
rich people, or people who are of eminence,

00:19:46.209 --> 00:19:52.970
but people who are already recognized
by public as something sensible, wise,

00:19:53.171 --> 00:19:55.620
whom you think have good vibrations

00:19:55.821 --> 00:19:59.917
and are capable of doing something
in Sahaja Yoga.

00:20:00.118 --> 00:20:02.214
I think you should approach boldly

00:20:02.415 --> 00:20:05.431
and tell them that you have found out this
and this.

00:20:05.632 --> 00:20:08.391
If you approach ten people, you will find
at least three of them

00:20:08.592 --> 00:20:12.550
will be happy to do something.

00:20:14.314 --> 00:20:16.671
That’s a much better way of doing
things,

00:20:16.872 --> 00:20:22.161
than to catch hold of one person here and a
one person there and a one person there.

00:20:22.362 --> 00:20:26.039
They’ll come to you. I was surprised when
they told Me

00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:31.396
that there were lots of people who came -
one by one all disappeared.

00:20:31.597 --> 00:20:35.654
One fellow was taught the complete
Kundalini yoga

00:20:35.855 --> 00:20:39.507
for eight months and he also disappeared.

00:20:40.818 --> 00:20:43.805
He never had the experience!

00:20:44.006 --> 00:20:48.086
Once you establish them up to a point where
they start feeling the vibrations

00:20:48.287 --> 00:20:54.149
and feeling the joy, they’ll never give up
Sahaja Yoga.

00:20:55.437 --> 00:21:00.592
But you must also weigh a person, how deep
he is.

00:21:00.793 --> 00:21:04.513
So the whole attitude towards spreading
Sahaja Yoga should be

00:21:04.714 --> 00:21:12.381
that it is not a thing that to be thrown
away before people who do not understand.

00:21:12.851 --> 00:21:16.608
I know you feel very much for Americans.
I, too, feel the same way.

00:21:16.809 --> 00:21:22.745
And we wish we had more and more American
people coming to Sahaja Yoga, no doubt.

00:21:22.946 --> 00:21:30.146
But it is only in our hands to work hard.
We can’t say what we’ll achieve.

00:21:31.442 --> 00:21:37.056
We must also understand what are
the problems of the American people,

00:21:37.986 --> 00:21:46.948
what sort of things that are obstructing
them from coming to Sahaja Yoga.

00:21:47.727 --> 00:21:53.222
So perhaps maybe tomorrow I’ll be able to
tell you what I have understood about them.

00:21:53.423 --> 00:21:55.741
Then you keep that in your mind.

00:21:55.942 --> 00:22:02.493
With that, if you approach with a proper
attitude of self-confidence,

00:22:03.088 --> 00:22:08.101
then I am sure you can do very well. But
there should be self-confidence in you.

00:22:08.311 --> 00:22:12.536
That doesn’t mean that you should aggress,
but there should be a self-confidence.

00:22:12.737 --> 00:22:19.315
If you have to do something right, you have
to be yourself fully confident of it.

00:22:19.516 --> 00:22:22.801
Otherwise, nobody is going to believe you.

00:22:23.002 --> 00:22:29.369
We want to get some more Sahaja Yogis
from India to help you out.

00:22:29.641 --> 00:22:36.331
But, first of all, those who are here,
I think, you must try to listen to them.

00:22:36.532 --> 00:22:40.940
Instead of that, I am (indistinct name)
told Me that you teach them.

00:22:41.141 --> 00:22:47.896
I am not saying that Indians are all very
good, that they are very capable.

00:22:48.097 --> 00:22:51.871
But one thing is that they have been
with Me for days together.

00:22:52.072 --> 00:22:57.743
Apart from that, all Indians are not good
than all the Americans,

00:22:57.944 --> 00:23:04.771
but some of them are very good. And those
who are very good must be respected.

00:23:04.972 --> 00:23:10.527
And try to understand the attitude of such
people, what they have to tell you.

00:23:12.411 --> 00:23:16.228
The way you understand life is not correct.

00:23:16.429 --> 00:23:22.245
If it was correct, there would have been
a different America.

00:23:22.928 --> 00:23:26.440
Lots of mistakes have been made.

00:23:26.641 --> 00:23:33.680
And to get to new life and to new styles,
a new understanding of the new age,

00:23:33.881 --> 00:23:43.574
we have to understand that it is a new
knowledge for us

00:23:43.775 --> 00:23:48.006
and we have to learn it and understand it.

00:23:48.207 --> 00:23:53.292
So far we have had no knowledge about
living processes.

00:23:53.493 --> 00:23:56.431
Whatever knowledge we have had is of dead,

00:23:56.632 --> 00:24:01.519
like you can make a house out of a dead
tree, from dead to the dead.

00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:06.218
But living processes you have never
understood.

00:24:08.767 --> 00:24:15.531
So the whole working of saintliness is
nothing but your attitude

00:24:15.732 --> 00:24:23.301
towards the knowledge how the living
process of our evolution works out,

00:24:23.502 --> 00:24:28.068
and complete confidence in your knowledge.

00:24:28.245 --> 00:24:32.017
I am sure you’ll pay full attention to what
I have said it.

00:24:32.218 --> 00:24:35.132
Also, tomorrow you can ask Me questions
about it.

00:24:35.333 --> 00:24:38.603
In this short time I cannot tell you
everything elaborately,

00:24:38.804 --> 00:24:47.519
but I hope you understand that a new type
of attitude is to be taken,

00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:51.679
if you have to achieve that vision.

00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:54.588
May God bless you.

00:25:06.852 --> 00:25:12.870
Now, whatever you say, I'll sit there,
we can watch the film.

00:25:14.447 --> 00:25:18.296
Whatever is the programme... (Marathi)
