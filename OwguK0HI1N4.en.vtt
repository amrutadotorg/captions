WEBVTT

01:48.605 --> 01:51.288
Please, be seated.

02:33.097 --> 02:45.683
It is so very beautiful to be in such
natural surroundings with you all.

02:47.921 --> 02:57.589
In the hubbub of the city, you don’t find
this peace,

02:58.814 --> 03:06.190
and it’s very good for all those who are
seeking their ascent.

03:08.993 --> 03:13.292
You all asked Me to come for this Ganesha
Puja.

03:13.493 --> 03:20.399
I thought it was essential that Shri
Ganesha should be established,

03:22.338 --> 03:30.883
and I am so very happy that there are so
many Americans now who are Sahaja Yogis.

03:31.148 --> 03:39.593
Of course, compared to the population
of America they are very few,

03:39.794 --> 03:43.138
and we have to have many more.

03:43.339 --> 03:49.604
But they have basic problems, and one
of them I think is of Shri Ganesh;

03:49.805 --> 03:56.951
and that’s why it was necessary to have
this Shri Ganesha’s Puja

03:57.152 --> 04:04.178
in Los Angeles - or you may call whichever
places this one is, San Diego,

04:04.530 --> 04:15.067
or on this mountain - which I hope so,
will be able to establish

04:15.268 --> 04:24.553
that essence of innocence which is so much
in a sleeping state.

04:30.891 --> 04:37.412
Today I just wanted to tell you few things

04:37.660 --> 04:44.721
as to how we should deal with the people
who come around.

04:47.097 --> 04:55.535
The idea that we should deal with
the seekers who are coming to see us,

04:55.736 --> 05:07.592
is that we should try to be little
apologetic

05:07.793 --> 05:12.626
and to tell them about all chakras,

05:13.093 --> 05:21.971
give them a feedback, as they call it,
on the mental level.

05:23.453 --> 05:28.243
But I do not think that’s a very good
style.

05:29.293 --> 05:35.735
You have to first give them the experience
of realisation,

05:38.015 --> 05:43.344
and tell them that this is not any gurudom

05:43.545 --> 05:53.922
or any such false hocus-pocus as they
call it - nonsense here,

05:54.137 --> 06:02.453
but is the evolutionary process

06:02.654 --> 06:11.071
which is a natural progressive
manifestation

06:11.272 --> 06:15.700
of the power within us.

06:18.480 --> 06:22.342
And you have to tell about Me!

06:22.854 --> 06:36.835
We have tried not to talk about Me and we
have tried to avoid the topic.

06:37.227 --> 06:43.056
Perhaps because you think that there have
been gurus and this and that,

06:43.257 --> 06:48.521
and the gurus have brought a bad name.
It’s not so!

06:48.730 --> 06:54.084
Even now people are going to those gurus
in very large number,

06:54.285 --> 07:02.219
and they start claiming they are semi-gods,
demi-gods or gods or whatever it is.

07:02.522 --> 07:07.224
So this kind of an apologetic attitude will
not convince them.

07:07.425 --> 07:11.275
You have to give them experience and say
that this is the One

07:11.476 --> 07:15.001
whose grace has worked on you.

07:16.361 --> 07:25.289
Psychologically you’ll be amazed - it
always works the other way round.

07:25.490 --> 07:29.335
Supposing tomorrow you arrange My program
[in] San Diego,

07:29.536 --> 07:33.385
we can easily get three hundred people.

07:33.625 --> 07:38.312
But when you want to have a follow-on,
they don’t want to come.

07:42.771 --> 07:46.224
Or when you have workshop, if I am there
there are so many,

07:46.425 --> 07:50.546
and then they are not interested in seeing
you.

07:53.803 --> 07:59.505
So the reason for such a behaviour is
only one,

07:59.753 --> 08:03.597
that they don’t want to go through all that
mental occupation

08:03.798 --> 08:11.553
and mental acrobats that you want
to tell them.

08:12.942 --> 08:18.002
As they want to feel Me in a meeting,

08:18.203 --> 08:22.859
they want to feel Me through you people.

08:25.665 --> 08:29.846
And I think you must change your tactics.

08:30.047 --> 08:34.889
In a simple natural way, tell them that,
«We were seekers,

08:35.090 --> 08:39.323
we went to many gurus, we never found it.

08:39.524 --> 08:46.077
We were cheated. Here is somebody who
doesn’t take any money,

08:47.737 --> 08:55.176
doesn’t want anything, doesn’t make you
abnormal, you lead a very normal life,

08:55.377 --> 09:00.041
and gives you all kinds of blessings,
try that.

09:00.599 --> 09:05.093
If you don’t want to experience it, you
need not».

09:05.523 --> 09:11.791
You see, it is like a person who is not
a realized soul.

09:11.992 --> 09:14.628
He says, “I must fight my ego.”

09:14.829 --> 09:18.424
But with what do you fight? It’s your
own ego.

09:18.625 --> 09:22.039
So you add to your ego.

09:22.279 --> 09:29.316
In the same way, when you go on pampering
these people, you add to their ego,

09:29.517 --> 09:35.868
and they become hard-boiled eggs actually,
impossible to penetrate.

09:36.449 --> 09:45.482
So your devotion, dedication to Me will
prove the results, no way out.

09:45.683 --> 09:52.286
If you talk to them directly, they wouldn’t
listen to you. That’s human nature.

09:52.487 --> 09:55.901
You can’t help it. How do you explain

09:56.102 --> 10:03.475
that when I come and give a lecture
in any place, there are so many?

10:03.676 --> 10:08.409
Because they think I am authentic, I speak
with authority,

10:08.610 --> 10:15.380
not with aggressiveness, but with
conviction and with a character.

10:17.370 --> 10:21.934
That conviction has to be expressed.

10:22.144 --> 10:24.041
On the contrary, when you start telling
them

10:24.242 --> 10:25.673
there is a chakra, this thing, that thing,
they say,

10:25.874 --> 10:30.997
“All right, we can read a book. Why do we
need these headaches?”

10:33.505 --> 10:41.978
So you should be people of conviction,
not of falsehood, but of reality.

10:42.179 --> 10:45.869
I must say today because you are all here,

10:46.070 --> 10:50.923
we have got some very good Sahaja Yogis
from India for you.

10:51.124 --> 10:57.156
But I don’t know how far you listen
to them. Like we have got Mr Kharde.

10:57.357 --> 11:01.973
He is the man who started Sangamner,
and those who have been to Sangamner

11:02.174 --> 11:17.771
have seen that a complete big gymnasium,
like a huge big football area,

11:17.972 --> 11:23.905
was covered by the people who came
down in Sangamner.

11:24.106 --> 11:33.877
And he has really established this
Sangamner city

11:34.228 --> 11:39.057
into a beautiful centre.

11:40.638 --> 11:44.040
But you have to listen to him;

11:47.493 --> 11:51.092
otherwise, they are useless.

11:51.848 --> 11:55.866
Secondly, Cheryl Worker is a very good
Sahaja Yogini.

11:56.067 --> 12:00.381
Apart from anything, she is very
auspicious, knowledgeable.

12:00.582 --> 12:04.975
Knowledge of Sahaja Yoga is not the way
you understand.

12:05.176 --> 12:11.807
It’s not the knowledge of chakras.
It’s the knowledge of attitudes.

12:13.054 --> 12:18.105
It’s not the knowledge of any system.
We don’t want to have systems,

12:18.321 --> 12:25.454
because every system creates a bondage,
a kind of a slavery.

12:25.947 --> 12:28.837
We have to develop attitudes within us

12:29.022 --> 12:36.233
which attitudes are tried and tested
on experience.

12:36.908 --> 12:45.748
So it is not what you can talk elaborately
about chakras and things is important,

12:45.957 --> 12:54.189
but it is what you express your personality

12:54.934 --> 12:58.893
in your attitudes towards things.

13:00.869 --> 13:05.123
All kinds of systems are built up and
especially in the West

13:05.324 --> 13:10.808
is a common habit to form a system.
Some sort of a norm is to be formed.

13:11.009 --> 13:18.246
For example, a system will be built up:
we eat our food like this.

13:18.447 --> 13:22.416
All right, then everybody starts eating
the same way.

13:22.617 --> 13:27.692
Or they built up a system long time back,
say, have tailcoats for dinners.

13:27.893 --> 13:32.279
For dinner, you must change your dress.
Morning another dress.

13:32.480 --> 13:35.918
Then people got fed up with it. They said,
“This is no good.”

13:36.119 --> 13:40.655
So they started anti-culture. So the anti-
culture started,

13:40.869 --> 13:47.716
with that they started hippies. Now hippies
also had their system.

13:47.917 --> 13:51.188
To be a hippie you had to wear a dress like
that, you had to be dirty,

13:51.389 --> 13:56.066
you had to have hair like that, you had
to move in a particular fashion.

13:56.267 --> 13:58.760
Again another system was built in.

13:58.983 --> 14:03.220
When they broke that system, then another.
Now a punk system has come.

14:03.421 --> 14:06.379
Now that punk business is you have to have
a dress like this,

14:06.580 --> 14:10.331
you have to have a particular type
of a hairdress for which

14:10.532 --> 14:13.959
you have to spend so much money; otherwise,
you are not a punk.

14:14.160 --> 14:17.946
So when they try to break also any systems,
they fall into another system.

14:18.147 --> 14:23.962
And go on following systems and systems
from one dead to another dead.

14:24.438 --> 14:29.736
But the attitude is the same. Attitude
doesn’t change.

14:29.937 --> 14:34.219
I have seen the hippies when they became
anti-culture,

14:34.420 --> 14:39.391
they started behaving in such a funny
manner that there was no change at all.

14:39.592 --> 14:45.429
They became very arrogant, without any
self-respect.

14:45.630 --> 14:49.951
Then came these punks. They are just
the same.

14:50.350 --> 14:56.257
So the change in your attitude is the main
transformation that takes place.

14:56.458 --> 15:00.336
Your priorities change absolutely.

15:01.695 --> 15:06.105
So we should not form a system.

15:08.105 --> 15:14.586
As I told you last night, you should not
say that eight hours meditation,

15:14.787 --> 15:18.972
nothing of the kind. Eight minutes are
sufficient.

15:19.244 --> 15:22.746
It’s the attitude that is going to help
your growth,

15:22.947 --> 15:27.560
not you are sitting for eight hours
on one leg or something like that.

15:27.761 --> 15:31.049
There are some sadhus who just stand up
and put one leg like this

15:31.250 --> 15:34.425
and they said, “We are sitting on one leg”.

15:34.626 --> 15:37.149
That’s not going to help! It’s a living
process,

15:37.350 --> 15:41.312
and a living process has to be worked out
in a living way.

15:41.513 --> 15:46.337
Allow it to work out. Allow it to grow.

15:46.538 --> 15:50.245
So the whole attitude should be changed.

15:51.500 --> 15:53.844
And when you start finding your attitude

15:54.045 --> 15:56.855
towards life is changing, then you must
realize... [interruption].

15:57.056 --> 16:04.151
...who wants to get his realisation, you
better do it.

16:04.352 --> 16:10.356
I think we have not yet touched those shores
where there are real seekers existing.

16:10.557 --> 16:13.750
That’s why we are getting very, very few
people.

16:13.911 --> 16:25.803
Like when the fishermen are taking their
trawlers on the waves of the seas,

16:26.004 --> 16:30.902
they know where there are shoals of fishes

16:31.103 --> 16:36.481
and they direct their trawlers to those
places and catch fishes.

16:36.682 --> 16:44.426
In the same way, we must also, first
of all, find out where are those seekers,

16:44.627 --> 16:52.601
where we can direct our attention and
our efforts.

16:52.802 --> 16:59.717
Like in [audio interruption] ...you will see
you will get [the] right type of people.

17:03.520 --> 17:06.865
In Calcutta, when I went there, there is
one Mr Jalan

17:07.066 --> 17:12.853
who is a very wise businessman. He came
to Sahaja Yoga.

17:13.411 --> 17:21.252
He sent letters to all the eminent people
whom he thought would be seeking,

17:21.453 --> 17:29.082
and he said he would like to go and meet
them, or they can come and see him.

17:29.960 --> 17:34.093
Out of all these letters, there were few
people, of course,

17:34.294 --> 17:38.769
who answered and wanted to meet him.

17:39.113 --> 17:42.758
That’s how he met some very important
people.

17:42.959 --> 17:48.534
Then he told them what is Sahaja Yoga,
talked to them.

17:48.735 --> 17:53.571
And when I went there, he made Me meet
them.

17:54.406 --> 18:07.006
One of them was an editor of a big
newspaper who came to see Me.

18:07.207 --> 18:13.140
And he saw Me, how I was treating people
and how I was looking after them,

18:13.341 --> 18:16.778
and he wrote a beautiful article

18:17.396 --> 18:20.522
and he said, “Mother, tomorrow I will
come to the program.”

18:20.723 --> 18:24.191
He came, he gave a very beautiful
introduction

18:24.392 --> 18:28.541
and the whole thing started on a different
line.

18:32.162 --> 18:38.480
I can tell you about Italy. There’s one
lady called Alganesh.

18:38.966 --> 18:42.477
She went and saw somebody whom she
thought was a seeker

18:42.678 --> 18:50.396
and he is a Director in the Broadcasting
in Italy, the Government Broadcasting.

18:50.597 --> 18:53.100
And he is a television man.

18:53.276 --> 18:58.373
She told him that, «You can get your
realization».

18:58.574 --> 19:01.073
When I went and saw him, he said, “First
give me realization,

19:01.274 --> 19:04.627
then I’ll take Your interview.” I said,
“He is the man!”

19:04.828 --> 19:08.702
And I paid all My attention to him, I gave
him realization.

19:08.895 --> 19:12.754
Also he had some experiences.

19:12.955 --> 19:19.588
And then he just wholeheartedly came out
as a big Sahaja Yogi

19:19.789 --> 19:25.020
and now in Italy, Sahaja Yoga is spreading
very fast.

19:25.222 --> 19:27.802
So you should not go about picking up some
beggars

19:28.003 --> 19:32.034
on the street, “Please come to Sahaja Yoga.
Please come to Sahaja Yoga”.

19:32.235 --> 19:35.957
What are they going to do? They are just
liabilities.

19:36.158 --> 19:39.520
What are they going to help us?

19:40.976 --> 19:46.008
I am not saying that we should go after
rich people, or people who are of eminence,

19:46.209 --> 19:52.970
but people who are already recognized
by public as something sensible, wise,

19:53.171 --> 19:55.620
whom you think have good vibrations

19:55.821 --> 19:59.917
and are capable of doing something
in Sahaja Yoga.

20:00.118 --> 20:02.214
I think you should approach boldly

20:02.415 --> 20:05.431
and tell them that you have found out this
and this.

20:05.632 --> 20:08.391
If you approach ten people, you will find
at least three of them

20:08.592 --> 20:12.550
will be happy to do something.

20:14.314 --> 20:16.671
That’s a much better way of doing
things,

20:16.872 --> 20:22.161
than to catch hold of one person here and a
one person there and a one person there.

20:22.362 --> 20:26.039
They’ll come to you. I was surprised when
they told Me

20:26.240 --> 20:31.396
that there were lots of people who came -
one by one all disappeared.

20:31.597 --> 20:35.654
One fellow was taught the complete
Kundalini yoga

20:35.855 --> 20:39.507
for eight months and he also disappeared.

20:40.818 --> 20:43.805
He never had the experience!

20:44.006 --> 20:48.086
Once you establish them up to a point where
they start feeling the vibrations

20:48.287 --> 20:54.149
and feeling the joy, they’ll never give up
Sahaja Yoga.

20:55.437 --> 21:00.592
But you must also weigh a person, how deep
he is.

21:00.793 --> 21:04.513
So the whole attitude towards spreading
Sahaja Yoga should be

21:04.714 --> 21:12.381
that it is not a thing that to be thrown
away before people who do not understand.

21:12.851 --> 21:16.608
I know you feel very much for Americans.
I, too, feel the same way.

21:16.809 --> 21:22.745
And we wish we had more and more American
people coming to Sahaja Yoga, no doubt.

21:22.946 --> 21:30.146
But it is only in our hands to work hard.
We can’t say what we’ll achieve.

21:31.442 --> 21:37.056
We must also understand what are
the problems of the American people,

21:37.986 --> 21:46.948
what sort of things that are obstructing
them from coming to Sahaja Yoga.

21:47.727 --> 21:53.222
So perhaps maybe tomorrow I’ll be able to
tell you what I have understood about them.

21:53.423 --> 21:55.741
Then you keep that in your mind.

21:55.942 --> 22:02.493
With that, if you approach with a proper
attitude of self-confidence,

22:03.088 --> 22:08.101
then I am sure you can do very well. But
there should be self-confidence in you.

22:08.311 --> 22:12.536
That doesn’t mean that you should aggress,
but there should be a self-confidence.

22:12.737 --> 22:19.315
If you have to do something right, you have
to be yourself fully confident of it.

22:19.516 --> 22:22.801
Otherwise, nobody is going to believe you.

22:23.002 --> 22:29.369
We want to get some more Sahaja Yogis
from India to help you out.

22:29.641 --> 22:36.331
But, first of all, those who are here,
I think, you must try to listen to them.

22:36.532 --> 22:40.940
Instead of that, I am (indistinct name)
told Me that you teach them.

22:41.141 --> 22:47.896
I am not saying that Indians are all very
good, that they are very capable.

22:48.097 --> 22:51.871
But one thing is that they have been
with Me for days together.

22:52.072 --> 22:57.743
Apart from that, all Indians are not good
than all the Americans,

22:57.944 --> 23:04.771
but some of them are very good. And those
who are very good must be respected.

23:04.972 --> 23:10.527
And try to understand the attitude of such
people, what they have to tell you.

23:12.411 --> 23:16.228
The way you understand life is not correct.

23:16.429 --> 23:22.245
If it was correct, there would have been
a different America.

23:22.928 --> 23:26.440
Lots of mistakes have been made.

23:26.641 --> 23:33.680
And to get to new life and to new styles,
a new understanding of the new age,

23:33.881 --> 23:43.574
we have to understand that it is a new
knowledge for us

23:43.775 --> 23:48.006
and we have to learn it and understand it.

23:48.207 --> 23:53.292
So far we have had no knowledge about
living processes.

23:53.493 --> 23:56.431
Whatever knowledge we have had is of dead,

23:56.632 --> 24:01.519
like you can make a house out of a dead
tree, from dead to the dead.

24:01.720 --> 24:06.218
But living processes you have never
understood.

24:08.767 --> 24:15.531
So the whole working of saintliness is
nothing but your attitude

24:15.732 --> 24:23.301
towards the knowledge how the living
process of our evolution works out,

24:23.502 --> 24:28.068
and complete confidence in your knowledge.

24:28.245 --> 24:32.017
I am sure you’ll pay full attention to what
I have said it.

24:32.218 --> 24:35.132
Also, tomorrow you can ask Me questions
about it.

24:35.333 --> 24:38.603
In this short time I cannot tell you
everything elaborately,

24:38.804 --> 24:47.519
but I hope you understand that a new type
of attitude is to be taken,

24:47.720 --> 24:51.679
if you have to achieve that vision.

24:51.880 --> 24:54.588
May God bless you.

25:06.852 --> 25:12.870
Now, whatever you say, I'll sit there,
we can watch the film.

25:14.447 --> 25:18.296
Whatever is the programme... (Marathi)
