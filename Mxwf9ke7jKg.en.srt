1
00:22:31,996 --> 00:22:41,596
Is very difficult to speak, even for Me

2
00:22:44,524 --> 00:22:51,604
to see so many Sahaja yogis

3
00:22:53,644 --> 00:23:02,004
sitting here with such shining faces

4
00:23:02,004 --> 00:23:05,524
from all over the world,

5
00:23:07,964 --> 00:23:15,164
as if My vision has taken its form today.

6
00:23:22,244 --> 00:23:30,884
I see in you the saviors of tomorrow

7
00:23:30,884 --> 00:23:35,044
who are going to save this world

8
00:23:35,364 --> 00:23:40,284
from all the Kali Yuga calamities

9
00:23:40,524 --> 00:23:43,884
that are surrounding us.

10
00:23:44,844 --> 00:23:48,604
Is coming from all sides,

11
00:23:49,564 --> 00:23:57,004
while you people have really taken your second birth

12
00:23:57,284 --> 00:24:01,484
from this pond of Kali Yuga

13
00:24:01,484 --> 00:24:07,164
and have really become beautiful lotuses of different colors,

14
00:24:07,164 --> 00:24:11,964
hues, fragrance and beauty.

15
00:24:12,604 --> 00:24:17,164
Instead of you celebrating My birthday,

16
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:22,204
is better I celebrate your birthdays.

17
00:24:27,764 --> 00:24:30,004
As I told you the other day that

18
00:24:30,004 --> 00:24:39,844
it is you who are such great seekers, seekers of truth, of love,

19
00:24:39,844 --> 00:24:42,644
that it could work out,

20
00:24:45,364 --> 00:24:48,284
otherwise it would have been impossible.

21
00:24:48,284 --> 00:24:52,764
To even transform one person is very difficult,

22
00:24:52,764 --> 00:24:57,284
but you were so sensitive

23
00:24:57,284 --> 00:25:02,644
and so deep that this subtle knowledge,

24
00:25:02,644 --> 00:25:08,404
I don't know how it penetrated your being.

25
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:10,964
It's unbelievable.

26
00:25:10,964 --> 00:25:14,844
I can't believe Myself

27
00:25:15,364 --> 00:25:22,884
what great people have taken birth in this Kali Yuga.

28
00:25:23,524 --> 00:25:27,004
No one can believe that there are so many

29
00:25:27,004 --> 00:25:29,524
saints are sitting before Me, so many Walis;

30
00:25:29,524 --> 00:25:33,244
so many Nalis are sitting before Me.

31
00:25:36,404 --> 00:25:41,844
In the history of spirituality it has never happened.

32
00:25:42,524 --> 00:25:46,804
Even in the heavens there are few devatas

33
00:25:46,804 --> 00:25:50,124
and devas, not so many.

34
00:25:51,244 --> 00:25:54,084
One better than the other

35
00:25:54,324 --> 00:26:00,564
such beautiful heart,

36
00:26:02,484 --> 00:26:06,564
such brilliant brains

37
00:26:06,884 --> 00:26:19,404
and such active attention, is really

38
00:26:19,404 --> 00:26:26,124
I thank you all that this seventieth birthday I could see

39
00:26:26,124 --> 00:26:30,724
so many people, which I never expected.

40
00:26:30,724 --> 00:26:35,564
You know, Sahaja Yoga was started with one person

41
00:26:35,564 --> 00:26:39,724
and then those who came also,

42
00:26:39,724 --> 00:26:45,564
out of them, some were power-oriented, money-oriented,

43
00:26:45,564 --> 00:26:49,964
all kinds of people created problems for us.

44
00:26:49,964 --> 00:26:53,524
One after another, so many problems came

45
00:26:53,524 --> 00:26:56,844
and also there were many who were

46
00:26:56,844 --> 00:27:01,404
of a very low-level seekers.

47
00:27:01,404 --> 00:27:07,764
But I find today they have all come up beautifully.

48
00:27:08,444 --> 00:27:13,684
I cannot distinguish one from another,

49
00:27:13,684 --> 00:27:16,404
the way it has happened.

50
00:27:16,404 --> 00:27:19,884
And the commitment you have to Sahaja Yoga

51
00:27:19,884 --> 00:27:26,124
is the greatest blessings for this world.

52
00:27:26,124 --> 00:27:31,764
I could not do it alone. You know that.

53
00:27:31,764 --> 00:27:37,004
If I could do it, I would not have needed you.

54
00:27:37,004 --> 00:27:39,964
You are the channels

55
00:27:40,204 --> 00:27:46,524
and you have to work it out further and further.

56
00:27:48,564 --> 00:27:53,964
It is really remarkable the way

57
00:27:53,964 --> 00:27:58,284
Delhi people have organized everything.

58
00:28:11,844 --> 00:28:14,924
First of all, everybody was very much

59
00:28:14,924 --> 00:28:17,764
keyed onto the seventieth birthday.

60
00:28:17,764 --> 00:28:23,084
I don't know what was the reason, but whatever it is,

61
00:28:23,084 --> 00:28:24,444
and then Delhi people said,

62
00:28:24,444 --> 00:28:26,444
"This time we are going to celebrate,

63
00:28:26,444 --> 00:28:29,404
Mother, Your birthday in Delhi."

64
00:28:29,684 --> 00:28:34,524
I said, "Everybody's ... on it, so be careful,

65
00:28:34,524 --> 00:28:38,564
it's not going to be easy. It's a big headache.

66
00:28:40,124 --> 00:28:42,884
So many will be coming down."

67
00:28:42,884 --> 00:28:46,484
But they didn't expect so much, I'm sure

68
00:28:48,364 --> 00:28:50,684
... people are coming. Hundred are coming from there,

69
00:28:50,684 --> 00:28:54,884
hundred from there. I said, "Are you worried?"

70
00:28:54,884 --> 00:28:58,204
They said, "No we are very happy about it."

71
00:28:58,204 --> 00:29:02,724
I saw their enthusiasm, their organization,

72
00:29:03,724 --> 00:29:05,404
the way they have done it.

73
00:29:05,404 --> 00:29:07,324
The best part of it,

74
00:29:07,564 --> 00:29:12,684
Delhi, which is a place where all kinds of politicians live,

75
00:29:12,964 --> 00:29:15,884
have groups and politics and all that,

76
00:29:15,884 --> 00:29:21,164
but in Sahaja Yoga in Delhi there is no politics.

77
00:29:31,444 --> 00:29:34,004
There is no quarrelling.

78
00:29:34,444 --> 00:29:36,924
There is no pulling each other's legs.

79
00:29:36,924 --> 00:29:39,764
Is very remarkable thing

80
00:29:39,764 --> 00:29:42,884
it to happen in a place like Delhi,

81
00:29:42,884 --> 00:29:45,004
where every day what you hear

82
00:29:45,004 --> 00:29:50,324
that even in our parliament they are beating each other.

83
00:29:51,604 --> 00:29:54,164
Perhaps, in this hell only,

84
00:29:54,164 --> 00:29:58,044
this goodness was to be born and

85
00:29:58,044 --> 00:30:01,124
to be manifested by Sahaja yogis.

86
00:30:01,124 --> 00:30:03,844
The knowledge of Sahaja Yoga,

87
00:30:03,844 --> 00:30:08,964
as you know, is extremely, extremely subtle

88
00:30:10,124 --> 00:30:13,604
and it's not easy

89
00:30:14,364 --> 00:30:21,124
to penetrate into the so-called

90
00:30:21,124 --> 00:30:24,604
people who call themselves intellectuals

91
00:30:24,604 --> 00:30:32,724
or who are absolutely bowed down to their conditionings.

92
00:30:33,564 --> 00:30:37,804
So, on one side, we have the masses who are ignorant,

93
00:30:37,804 --> 00:30:42,604
another side the classes who live in the frame

94
00:30:42,604 --> 00:30:46,244
that they have made out of their brains.

95
00:30:48,124 --> 00:30:52,244
Both ways, I think, they are extremely gross.

96
00:30:52,764 --> 00:30:58,644
But the way they have absorbed

97
00:30:58,644 --> 00:31:07,844
this subtle nectar of Divinity is something unbelievable.

98
00:31:10,684 --> 00:31:14,604
Nobody can comprehend even

99
00:31:16,844 --> 00:31:27,244
that there were so many born after My birth,

100
00:31:27,244 --> 00:31:30,724
on this Earth,

101
00:31:30,924 --> 00:31:35,684
or some maybe before also, very few.

102
00:31:35,684 --> 00:31:39,484
Just after My birth they were born here

103
00:31:42,244 --> 00:31:46,844
in this world, to get to Sahaja Yoga.

104
00:31:46,724 --> 00:31:52,244
But when I saw the world I was shocked,

105
00:31:52,244 --> 00:31:54,804
more shocked than Kabira, himself.

106
00:31:54,804 --> 00:31:59,604
I said, "How will I talk to anyone about it?"

107
00:32:00,164 --> 00:32:01,764
My family members,

108
00:32:01,764 --> 00:32:06,244
I didn't know how will I open the subject to them.

109
00:32:07,324 --> 00:32:14,484
Was impossible, so much was darkness of ignorance.

110
00:32:16,284 --> 00:32:22,084
How will they believe that there is really Divinity,

111
00:32:22,564 --> 00:32:27,204
there is totality waiting for them?

112
00:32:27,204 --> 00:32:31,324
They all believed into some sort of a religion,

113
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:34,644
which had no connection with reality.

114
00:32:36,964 --> 00:32:41,564
And it was impossible even to envisage

115
00:32:41,564 --> 00:32:45,684
the method by which I could talk to them.

116
00:32:45,924 --> 00:32:48,804
I remember the first incident

117
00:32:48,804 --> 00:32:56,204
when we went to Nargol, where I had opened the Sahasrara.

118
00:32:56,844 --> 00:33:02,524
The first person who got realization was a Gujarati and a jeweler.

119
00:33:02,844 --> 00:33:06,324
Immediately, all the other,

120
00:33:06,324 --> 00:33:09,844
there were hardly about thirty-five people

121
00:33:09,844 --> 00:33:11,404
they started saying that

122
00:33:11,404 --> 00:33:14,204
"Of course, he's a rich man, he's a jeweler,

123
00:33:14,204 --> 00:33:17,004
so Mother has given him realization."

124
00:33:17,004 --> 00:33:21,044
I think that's the first time and last time I really got angry.

125
00:33:21,604 --> 00:33:24,964
I started shouting at them,

126
00:33:24,964 --> 00:33:26,964
"You are good for nothing, useless people,

127
00:33:26,964 --> 00:33:29,844
you can never take to Divinity,"

128
00:33:29,844 --> 00:33:32,604
and I had really thought that "Stop it now."

129
00:33:32,604 --> 00:33:35,124
One has to take another life,

130
00:33:35,124 --> 00:33:40,844
another time where people will understand what is Sahaja Yoga.

131
00:33:41,084 --> 00:33:45,884
But after that, suddenly,

132
00:33:45,884 --> 00:33:49,164
people started feeling the cool breeze in their hands,

133
00:33:49,164 --> 00:33:54,044
immediately, after My shouting. Imagine.

134
00:33:54,044 --> 00:34:00,564
And they said, "Mother, You know, it's working.

135
00:34:00,564 --> 00:34:03,444
It's working in us. It's working out of us."

136
00:34:03,444 --> 00:34:08,164
Thus, we got twelve people

137
00:34:08,164 --> 00:34:15,324
and one lady whom I had given before also,

138
00:34:16,404 --> 00:34:19,484
she was the fourteenth.

139
00:34:23,044 --> 00:34:27,364
Thus, first we had only these fourteen Sahaja yogis,

140
00:34:28,684 --> 00:34:34,244
for whom it was something out of the blue.

141
00:34:34,244 --> 00:34:36,844
They were all flabbergasted.

142
00:34:37,124 --> 00:34:39,604
They didn't know what it was.

143
00:34:42,804 --> 00:34:47,044
And then, surprisingly, in one of our programs,

144
00:34:47,044 --> 00:34:55,564
a lady who was possessed by some Brahmin came

145
00:34:55,764 --> 00:35:01,284
and started saying, "Jagadamba, Jagadamba."

146
00:35:01,284 --> 00:35:05,724
They couldn't understand. I never told them what I was, never.

147
00:35:05,724 --> 00:35:08,004
I've never told otherwise also.

148
00:35:09,724 --> 00:35:13,324
So then, she recited a poem

149
00:35:13,324 --> 00:35:16,204
from Saundarya Lahari in Sanskrit language

150
00:35:16,204 --> 00:35:18,604
and she was just a maidservant.

151
00:35:18,844 --> 00:35:21,844
And in a man's voice.

152
00:35:24,044 --> 00:35:25,844
So everybody was shocked

153
00:35:26,164 --> 00:35:29,604
that the bhoots should say all these things.

154
00:35:29,604 --> 00:35:32,164
And then she went away.

155
00:35:32,164 --> 00:35:37,444
After that, these people started probing into it.

156
00:35:38,244 --> 00:35:42,604
And they wanted to have My Puja, first time,

157
00:35:42,604 --> 00:35:45,764
in My house itself.

158
00:35:46,044 --> 00:35:54,284
Still people were not very sure they were doing the right thing.

159
00:35:54,284 --> 00:35:56,164
Even the Brahmins they called, they said,

160
00:35:56,164 --> 00:35:59,524
"This Saptasadi is a very difficult Puja

161
00:35:59,524 --> 00:36:03,164
and something will happen to us."

162
00:36:03,164 --> 00:36:04,764
But after the Puja they said,

163
00:36:05,124 --> 00:36:08,844
"Nothing happened, we are so much better."

164
00:36:08,844 --> 00:36:13,324
They all felt the cool breeze

165
00:36:13,324 --> 00:36:17,124
and the entire atmosphere changed.

166
00:36:17,124 --> 00:36:20,324
They started understanding that

167
00:36:20,324 --> 00:36:26,004
Sahaja Yoga is the Yuga Dharma, is the one

168
00:36:27,204 --> 00:36:34,204
of this yuga, this Kali Yuga,

169
00:36:34,884 --> 00:36:42,084
so the Sahaj Dharma became the dharma of this yuga.

170
00:36:44,644 --> 00:36:48,164
This yuga is very difficult, no doubt.

171
00:36:48,884 --> 00:36:55,404
But in difficulties only we become intense seekers

172
00:36:55,404 --> 00:37:01,324
and that's what happened with all of you,

173
00:37:01,324 --> 00:37:08,164
that you found out that everywhere

174
00:37:08,164 --> 00:37:11,444
people were following whatever they're following,

175
00:37:11,444 --> 00:37:15,284
they were not reaching any point.

176
00:37:15,284 --> 00:37:18,164
Like a cocoon,

177
00:37:18,164 --> 00:37:22,004
they're hitting their head here and there.

178
00:37:22,004 --> 00:37:25,284
They got their realizations

179
00:37:25,604 --> 00:37:29,564
so quickly and when they told Me

180
00:37:31,764 --> 00:37:34,884
how they were seeking, what was happening to them,

181
00:37:34,884 --> 00:37:38,964
I was amazed.

182
00:37:41,204 --> 00:37:44,324
How this seeking was working within them

183
00:37:44,324 --> 00:37:47,284
and pushed them towards Sahaja Yoga.

184
00:37:47,284 --> 00:37:49,484
Also, in the meanwhile, I must say,

185
00:37:49,484 --> 00:37:58,124
so many got lost into the clutches of false gurus.

186
00:37:58,124 --> 00:38:04,324
Despite that, today we have so many Sahaja yogis.

187
00:38:04,324 --> 00:38:07,124
You are just representing your country,

188
00:38:07,124 --> 00:38:11,044
but there are many more in your countries.

189
00:38:11,044 --> 00:38:13,764
Even in India we have many more.

190
00:38:13,764 --> 00:38:18,444
You are just here, come to represent them.

191
00:38:18,444 --> 00:38:21,524
So, multiple of this number,

192
00:38:21,524 --> 00:38:24,004
I do not know how many would be there.

193
00:38:24,004 --> 00:38:26,524
So many asked "Me how many Sahaja yogis there are". I said,

194
00:38:26,724 --> 00:38:28,404
"I don't know."

195
00:38:28,404 --> 00:38:29,524
Say, "You don't know?"

196
00:38:29,884 --> 00:38:34,284
I said, "No. We have never kept any record."

197
00:38:34,284 --> 00:38:36,764
So they can't understand. I said,

198
00:38:36,764 --> 00:38:43,924
"We have no office, no record. I have no secretary.

199
00:38:44,804 --> 00:38:46,924
I don't know how to type.

200
00:38:46,924 --> 00:38:50,644
I don't know how to write even My check."

201
00:38:51,564 --> 00:38:53,604
They can't understand

202
00:38:53,484 --> 00:38:57,724
person like Me existing in these modern times.

203
00:38:59,124 --> 00:39:02,844
But everything gets done, somehow.

204
00:39:03,964 --> 00:39:07,804
Despite all My modern ignorance,

205
00:39:07,804 --> 00:39:12,284
everything gets absolutely

206
00:39:12,284 --> 00:39:15,004
done in the most perfect manner

207
00:39:15,004 --> 00:39:19,124
like a remote control.

208
00:39:19,124 --> 00:39:22,204
Now this whole thing,

209
00:39:23,404 --> 00:39:28,844
I never said a word about it, I must tell you, nothing.

210
00:39:28,844 --> 00:39:34,644
Never I gave any idea as to how it should be.

211
00:39:34,644 --> 00:39:39,324
I didn't even tell them how many we are expecting.

212
00:39:40,404 --> 00:39:45,484
But see how spontaneously everything has worked out

213
00:39:45,484 --> 00:39:49,404
because you all have commitment

214
00:39:49,724 --> 00:39:53,044
and that commitment gives you

215
00:39:53,044 --> 00:39:57,444
all these organizing capacities.

216
00:40:00,964 --> 00:40:06,524
So many things you have seen get organized

217
00:40:06,524 --> 00:40:10,404
because also this Paramchaitanya

218
00:40:10,404 --> 00:40:14,724
has come into Krita Yuga

219
00:40:14,724 --> 00:40:18,964
where it is working it out. It's acting.

220
00:40:18,964 --> 00:40:24,604
And this activity, also, is absolutely supportive to you.

221
00:40:26,204 --> 00:40:29,484
For example, the police people told us

222
00:40:29,484 --> 00:40:31,764
that there are Muslims living here

223
00:40:31,764 --> 00:40:34,444
and you might have some danger from them.

224
00:40:34,444 --> 00:40:36,924
They might do some harm to you.

225
00:40:36,924 --> 00:40:39,084
I said, "Which Muslims are they?"

226
00:40:39,084 --> 00:40:43,724
So they said, "Nizamuddin Aulia's people are here."

227
00:40:45,004 --> 00:40:47,604
I said, "They'll never harm us."

228
00:40:47,604 --> 00:40:51,724
I said, "Why? Because he was a Sufi

229
00:40:51,724 --> 00:40:55,484
and he was a great realized soul

230
00:40:55,484 --> 00:41:00,764
and the people who are along there, must be, most of them are,

231
00:41:00,764 --> 00:41:05,164
at least, believers of Sufism.

232
00:41:05,164 --> 00:41:08,324
How can they harm us?"

233
00:41:08,324 --> 00:41:10,484
So I said, "Tomorrow, early in the morning,

234
00:41:10,484 --> 00:41:16,884
you go and put a chador, as they call it, all of you,"

235
00:41:16,884 --> 00:41:18,284
and they were so impressed

236
00:41:18,284 --> 00:41:23,404
that you saw in the evening they came here all the way,

237
00:41:23,404 --> 00:41:27,084
morning time, and they were so respectful.

238
00:41:27,084 --> 00:41:29,244
Then they called Me, they gave Me another chador,

239
00:41:29,244 --> 00:41:33,684
this, that and they said that we are Yours and this and that,

240
00:41:33,684 --> 00:41:35,484
all kinds of things.

241
00:41:35,484 --> 00:41:37,524
And his disciple was Amir Khusrau,

242
00:41:37,524 --> 00:41:41,084
was another very, very great Sufi gentleman

243
00:41:41,084 --> 00:41:44,804
and I always have admired his poetry

244
00:41:44,804 --> 00:41:51,244
and also the way Nizamuddin led his life of dignity

245
00:41:51,244 --> 00:41:55,444
and divinity.

246
00:41:54,364 --> 00:41:58,164
All these Muslims who were there put hands towards Me like this

247
00:41:58,164 --> 00:42:01,244
and they said, "We are feeling the cool breeze,"

248
00:42:01,244 --> 00:42:03,484
I said, "This is Ruh."

249
00:42:03,484 --> 00:42:06,244
"Ah, this is Ruh."

250
00:42:07,564 --> 00:42:10,244
Once these people start getting Ruh,

251
00:42:10,244 --> 00:42:12,764
they will all become Sahaja yogis very soon

252
00:42:12,764 --> 00:42:16,244
and you may have to have ...

253
00:42:27,364 --> 00:42:31,404
There are so many Sufis all over the world

254
00:42:31,404 --> 00:42:33,484
and we are going to take their addresses

255
00:42:33,484 --> 00:42:34,924
and we are going to meet them;

256
00:42:34,924 --> 00:42:37,644
then you might have to have another big pendal,

257
00:42:37,644 --> 00:42:41,444
double pendal I think, maybe triple.

258
00:42:47,724 --> 00:42:55,604
If Delhi people are not quite frightened about the sizes,

259
00:42:55,604 --> 00:43:00,044
I think again we'll have to have it in Delhi only.

260
00:43:16,124 --> 00:43:19,204
Also contemporarily,

261
00:43:19,844 --> 00:43:23,484
Delhi is in a state of turmoil

262
00:43:23,484 --> 00:43:28,284
and we should be here to pacify it, to quieten it,

263
00:43:28,284 --> 00:43:31,604
to give wisdom to those people

264
00:43:31,604 --> 00:43:35,404
who are supposed to be at the helm of affairs.

265
00:43:35,844 --> 00:43:39,884
It will work. Definitely, it will work.

266
00:43:39,884 --> 00:43:42,284
With all these Sahaja yogis

267
00:43:42,284 --> 00:43:44,644
emitting such beautiful, vibrations.

268
00:43:44,644 --> 00:43:46,124
See, on top of your head

269
00:43:46,124 --> 00:43:49,764
this cloth is moving up and down all the time,

270
00:43:50,004 --> 00:43:52,724
though there is no breeze outside,

271
00:43:52,724 --> 00:43:54,884
the leaves are just steady,

272
00:43:54,884 --> 00:43:59,364
but from your head, you see, you are moving all this.

273
00:44:02,364 --> 00:44:05,324
So I'm sure these vibrations

274
00:44:05,324 --> 00:44:10,084
will cool down and will bring peace

275
00:44:10,084 --> 00:44:14,844
to our politicians and to the people

276
00:44:14,844 --> 00:44:19,244
who are at the helm of affairs.

277
00:44:19,244 --> 00:44:23,524
At this juncture, when in the whole world

278
00:44:23,524 --> 00:44:28,004
there are so many things going on

279
00:44:28,004 --> 00:44:30,964
of uncertainties,

280
00:44:31,364 --> 00:44:34,444
say in Russia, there are uncertainties,

281
00:44:34,444 --> 00:44:37,604
Bosnia there is uncertainties,

282
00:44:37,604 --> 00:44:40,604
in England there's recession,

283
00:44:40,604 --> 00:44:42,764
America there is recession,

284
00:44:43,044 --> 00:44:44,844
Spain there is recession,

285
00:44:44,844 --> 00:44:47,644
everybody is suffering from the pangs

286
00:44:47,924 --> 00:44:53,684
of some sort of a extreme behavior they went into.

287
00:44:54,204 --> 00:44:56,764
So, I'm sure this polarity

288
00:44:56,764 --> 00:44:59,964
that they see now will correct

289
00:45:00,324 --> 00:45:04,164
their behavior towards materialism

290
00:45:04,164 --> 00:45:09,844
and I'm sure that a balance will be struck.

291
00:45:10,084 --> 00:45:13,764
With your good wishes, with your prayers,

292
00:45:13,764 --> 00:45:20,844
this world will be so beautiful,

293
00:45:20,844 --> 00:45:29,804
so enchanting that in the history,

294
00:45:29,804 --> 00:45:32,124
people will describe

295
00:45:32,124 --> 00:45:35,764
that the world itself became a lotus

296
00:45:35,764 --> 00:45:41,124
full of fragrance of Divinity.

297
00:45:49,404 --> 00:45:51,884
You are the petals,

298
00:45:53,364 --> 00:45:55,604
you are the corona,

299
00:45:58,124 --> 00:46:00,604
you are the color,

300
00:46:01,684 --> 00:46:04,164
you are the beauty,

301
00:46:05,724 --> 00:46:07,644
you are the pollen

302
00:46:08,404 --> 00:46:12,324
of that beautiful lotus

303
00:46:12,489 --> 00:46:15,329
I hope today

304
00:46:15,329 --> 00:46:21,849
you all will decide to work for Sahaja Yoga,

305
00:46:21,849 --> 00:46:23,289
to spread Sahaja Yoga

306
00:46:23,289 --> 00:46:27,089
and work for yourself also.

307
00:46:27,329 --> 00:46:29,249
The only danger is

308
00:46:29,249 --> 00:46:34,289
that one should not allow ego to sit on your heads.

309
00:46:34,529 --> 00:46:39,329
That's the only horse.

310
00:46:39,329 --> 00:46:44,129
If you could ride yourself and don't allow the horse to ride you,

311
00:46:44,129 --> 00:46:46,409
you'll progress very fast,

312
00:46:46,409 --> 00:46:49,609
beautifully.

313
00:46:52,689 --> 00:47:00,649
Thus, I'm sure Sahaja Yoga will spread.

314
00:47:00,649 --> 00:47:09,209
Every birthday we have to take a vow.

315
00:47:09,489 --> 00:47:14,649
I don't know what vow I should take.

316
00:47:17,769 --> 00:47:20,449
People have told Me that I should not work so hard,

317
00:47:20,449 --> 00:47:22,329
I'm working very hard,

318
00:47:22,329 --> 00:47:26,689
but I have taken a vow that I'll work double hard.

319
00:47:34,809 --> 00:47:36,689
In the same way, you also,

320
00:47:36,689 --> 00:47:39,569
all of you, have to take a vow today

321
00:47:39,569 --> 00:47:44,409
that we'll go all out in the commitment

322
00:47:44,409 --> 00:47:47,649
of working of Sahaja Yoga.

323
00:47:47,649 --> 00:47:50,529
We'll think about it.

324
00:47:50,529 --> 00:47:53,369
There are scientists who should produce books,

325
00:47:53,369 --> 00:47:56,049
there are doctors who should produce books,

326
00:47:56,049 --> 00:47:57,529
writings,

327
00:47:57,529 --> 00:47:58,849
go round,

328
00:47:58,849 --> 00:48:00,769
talk to their colleagues,

329
00:48:00,769 --> 00:48:04,729
organize meetings,

330
00:48:04,729 --> 00:48:08,249
seminars with your colleagues.

331
00:48:10,649 --> 00:48:13,529
There are architects

332
00:48:14,489 --> 00:48:19,049
and other professionals

333
00:48:19,609 --> 00:48:24,969
who could call their colleagues and give them realization.

334
00:48:24,969 --> 00:48:27,689
Even the people who are dealing with finances

335
00:48:27,689 --> 00:48:30,209
should take to Sahaja Yoga.

336
00:48:30,209 --> 00:48:33,809
Is very important because

337
00:48:33,809 --> 00:48:38,049
financial problems can only be

338
00:48:38,209 --> 00:48:40,929
solved by the Divine Power.

339
00:48:40,929 --> 00:48:44,489
Nobody else can solve it.

340
00:48:44,889 --> 00:48:48,649
So everyone in this world,

341
00:48:48,649 --> 00:48:54,089
whether it is law or any other field,

342
00:48:54,089 --> 00:48:59,329
all of you should take to Sahaja Yoga

343
00:49:00,209 --> 00:49:04,849
and also to creative work.

344
00:49:05,769 --> 00:49:10,169
Then also, you have to take Sahaja Yoga

345
00:49:10,169 --> 00:49:12,649
to your surroundings,

346
00:49:12,649 --> 00:49:19,169
to villages, to cities,

347
00:49:19,169 --> 00:49:22,209
wherever it is possible,

348
00:49:22,209 --> 00:49:24,609
wherever you can organize,

349
00:49:24,609 --> 00:49:28,489
you have to spread Sahaja Yoga everywhere.

350
00:49:28,489 --> 00:49:31,209
As far as curing is concerned,

351
00:49:31,209 --> 00:49:34,569
I would advise, you don't have to touch anyone.

352
00:49:34,569 --> 00:49:37,369
Please use only My photograph.

353
00:49:37,369 --> 00:49:40,209
That's how you'll get more Sahaja yogis

354
00:49:40,209 --> 00:49:44,649
and less sick people.

355
00:49:44,649 --> 00:49:47,169
Also, people will be cured

356
00:49:47,169 --> 00:49:50,929
and all of them will become Sahaja yogis.

357
00:49:51,209 --> 00:49:54,529
We have also agricultural field

358
00:49:54,529 --> 00:49:56,969
on which we have done something,

359
00:49:56,969 --> 00:50:02,369
but much can be done about agriculture.

360
00:50:02,369 --> 00:50:05,049
One should see the government and tell them

361
00:50:05,049 --> 00:50:07,449
what agriculture can do.

362
00:50:07,449 --> 00:50:10,529
You can form a committee and go and see them

363
00:50:12,849 --> 00:50:14,649
and talk to them that

364
00:50:14,649 --> 00:50:20,569
how agriculture can be helped by Sahaja Yoga.

365
00:50:20,569 --> 00:50:23,209
We have to help our children.

366
00:50:23,209 --> 00:50:25,569
We have to look after them

367
00:50:25,569 --> 00:50:34,769
because you know what sort of future is surrounding them,

368
00:50:34,769 --> 00:50:37,969
what sort of atmosphere is crawling,

369
00:50:37,969 --> 00:50:41,409
even in India.

370
00:50:41,409 --> 00:50:45,209
So we have to see that our children

371
00:50:45,209 --> 00:50:48,449
properly grow in Sahaj culture.

372
00:50:49,729 --> 00:50:51,729
Is very important

373
00:50:51,729 --> 00:50:55,569
because they are tomorrow's Sahaja yogis.

374
00:50:55,569 --> 00:50:58,409
So many of them are born realized,

375
00:50:58,409 --> 00:51:01,089
so we have to discipline them properly

376
00:51:01,089 --> 00:51:06,729
and we have to make them aala, "aala darza"

377
00:51:06,729 --> 00:51:11,289
Sahaja yogi, as described in the qawali.

378
00:51:15,769 --> 00:51:22,729
It is also our family life which is very important.

379
00:51:22,969 --> 00:51:24,769
Is shocking that

380
00:51:24,769 --> 00:51:28,329
family life is nowadays becoming

381
00:51:28,329 --> 00:51:32,249
a kind of a stupid thing.

382
00:51:32,249 --> 00:51:35,449
No one understands the importance of it.

383
00:51:35,449 --> 00:51:39,009
In Sahaja Yoga we have to understand.

384
00:51:39,009 --> 00:51:43,729
Small quarrels, fights, should be given up.

385
00:51:43,729 --> 00:51:49,089
Harshness must be given up, cruelty must be given up

386
00:51:49,049 --> 00:51:54,969
and there should be a proper rapport

387
00:51:54,969 --> 00:52:02,529
between husband and wife to begin with,

388
00:52:02,529 --> 00:52:06,169
so that there is a companionship

389
00:52:06,169 --> 00:52:09,489
and the children also see that companionship

390
00:52:09,489 --> 00:52:13,409
and enjoy it.

391
00:52:14,569 --> 00:52:18,009
In our dress, in our life,

392
00:52:18,009 --> 00:52:22,889
we have to be dignified and decent, respecting our body.

393
00:52:23,609 --> 00:52:25,369
Is very important.

394
00:52:25,569 --> 00:52:27,849
We should wear whatever suits us

395
00:52:27,849 --> 00:52:30,609
in whatever country we are.

396
00:52:31,369 --> 00:52:33,649
I mean, imagine in summer climate

397
00:52:33,649 --> 00:52:36,409
if somebody wants to wear a three-piece suit,

398
00:52:36,649 --> 00:52:38,849
what will happen to him?

399
00:52:39,529 --> 00:52:41,129
Whatever suits us,

400
00:52:41,129 --> 00:52:45,449
whatever fits our culture,

401
00:52:45,449 --> 00:52:50,009
one should try to wear decent dresses,

402
00:52:50,009 --> 00:52:52,729
traditional dresses.

403
00:52:52,969 --> 00:52:55,529
Specially for women, it is very important

404
00:52:55,529 --> 00:53:00,369
to wear dresses that will make them look more dignified.

405
00:53:07,449 --> 00:53:10,649
Also, another point I would like to say,

406
00:53:10,649 --> 00:53:15,529
that ladies, specially, must take to reading,

407
00:53:16,209 --> 00:53:19,049
at least newspapers.

408
00:53:19,369 --> 00:53:23,209
If your attention is on the problems

409
00:53:23,209 --> 00:53:26,809
that are in this world, it's very effective

410
00:53:26,809 --> 00:53:31,649
because you know your attention is active, it works.

411
00:53:33,449 --> 00:53:35,969
So use your attention.

412
00:53:35,969 --> 00:53:37,449
You see the newspapers,

413
00:53:37,449 --> 00:53:40,089
you watch -- I know it's horrifying sometimes

414
00:53:40,089 --> 00:53:41,889
you can give a bandhan,

415
00:53:41,889 --> 00:53:45,249
but you must see what's happening where,

416
00:53:45,249 --> 00:53:48,049
is very important.

417
00:53:48,049 --> 00:53:52,969
Also men should not just read something sensational,

418
00:53:52,969 --> 00:53:56,129
but read something that's happening

419
00:53:56,129 --> 00:53:59,529
and also think, what are the solutions.

420
00:53:59,529 --> 00:54:02,929
How can you people, as Sahaja yogis, help it,

421
00:54:02,929 --> 00:54:06,209
in a collective way or in an individual way.

422
00:54:06,209 --> 00:54:14,009
We have to solve many problems of this modern world.

423
00:54:14,009 --> 00:54:17,089
Also one has to read good books,

424
00:54:17,089 --> 00:54:20,129
good films one has to see,

425
00:54:20,129 --> 00:54:22,849
and have your reflection on them.

426
00:54:22,849 --> 00:54:24,809
Keep your mind alert.

427
00:54:24,809 --> 00:54:29,049
There are many beautiful poems I've read recently

428
00:54:29,049 --> 00:54:30,529
coming out of

429
00:54:30,529 --> 00:54:33,449
some people where I never expected they will write poems,

430
00:54:33,449 --> 00:54:36,009
beautiful, very high class.

431
00:54:36,209 --> 00:54:39,489
So this poetry also, we are going to collect.

432
00:54:39,489 --> 00:54:42,609
We are going to collect all the miraculous photographs

433
00:54:42,609 --> 00:54:44,129
from everywhere.

434
00:54:44,129 --> 00:54:47,529
They are trying to systematize now.

435
00:54:47,529 --> 00:54:49,489
And now, in this system,

436
00:54:49,489 --> 00:54:52,129
if you can all help spontaneously,

437
00:54:52,129 --> 00:54:56,569
it will be a great achievement

438
00:54:56,569 --> 00:55:00,089
because, so far, we have not been able to collect

439
00:55:00,089 --> 00:55:04,289
all these datas and keep them with us.

440
00:55:06,209 --> 00:55:09,329
Now the best is that you all must meditate.

441
00:55:09,329 --> 00:55:12,049
All have to meditate.

442
00:55:12,049 --> 00:55:14,809
Only in meditation you are in present

443
00:55:14,809 --> 00:55:17,609
and you grow in your spirituality.

444
00:55:17,609 --> 00:55:21,609
I've said it many a times, but people just don't do it.

445
00:55:21,609 --> 00:55:25,169
About ten minutes, if you can meditate

446
00:55:25,169 --> 00:55:28,769
before sleeping, it's of a very great help to you,

447
00:55:29,969 --> 00:55:31,649
no doubt.

448
00:55:32,009 --> 00:55:33,729
We really grow very fast.

449
00:55:33,729 --> 00:55:36,529
Immediately I know this man is meditating,

450
00:55:36,529 --> 00:55:38,689
the way he has changed.

451
00:55:38,689 --> 00:55:40,489
And then, once you get used to it,

452
00:55:40,729 --> 00:55:43,209
you'll never give it up.

453
00:55:43,209 --> 00:55:45,169
Is very simple meditation.

454
00:55:45,169 --> 00:55:47,929
You have foot soaking or something like that

455
00:55:47,929 --> 00:55:51,049
and in the morning you should beat your ego,

456
00:55:51,049 --> 00:55:52,729
that's all.

457
00:55:53,489 --> 00:55:55,769
Is not that you have to do

458
00:55:55,769 --> 00:55:59,209
one lakh jappas or something.

459
00:55:59,209 --> 00:56:00,689
Nothing of the kind.

460
00:56:00,689 --> 00:56:02,409
Is very simple.

461
00:56:02,409 --> 00:56:04,609
But this, you have to do for yourself,

462
00:56:04,609 --> 00:56:10,929
to respect your Self-realization and your growth in divinity.

463
00:56:13,409 --> 00:56:20,169
We have lots of advantages over others.

464
00:56:20,169 --> 00:56:22,449
But one thing I have to tell you,

465
00:56:22,449 --> 00:56:27,649
those people who are not prone to seeking,

466
00:56:27,649 --> 00:56:31,209
please don't talk to them about Sahaja Yoga.

467
00:56:31,209 --> 00:56:34,209
Don't waste your energy on such people,

468
00:56:34,209 --> 00:56:36,209
discussing and arguing,

469
00:56:36,209 --> 00:56:38,969
because it cannot be discussed much.

470
00:56:38,969 --> 00:56:41,649
You just forget them and leave them alone.

471
00:56:41,649 --> 00:56:43,249
I'll look after them.

472
00:56:43,249 --> 00:56:47,049
You just take to simple people, good people,

473
00:56:47,049 --> 00:56:51,129
who are seeking the truth.

474
00:56:51,129 --> 00:56:53,689
I don't want you to break your necks with those people

475
00:56:53,689 --> 00:56:57,449
who are just believing in discussion,

476
00:56:57,369 --> 00:57:00,809
arguments and shabda jaal.

477
00:57:00,809 --> 00:57:05,129
Today the Sahaja Yoga culture is so much manifesting

478
00:57:05,129 --> 00:57:08,249
that people, once they see you, they immediately know

479
00:57:08,249 --> 00:57:10,769
there's something special

480
00:57:11,009 --> 00:57:15,809
and that they have something very unique

481
00:57:15,809 --> 00:57:21,609
qualities among them which you seldom find with normal people.

482
00:57:21,609 --> 00:57:24,169
All these things, you should understand,

483
00:57:24,169 --> 00:57:27,289
have come to you spontaneously from within,

484
00:57:27,289 --> 00:57:30,849
but you must preserve them and you should never feel shy of them.

485
00:57:30,849 --> 00:57:34,329
Should never be shy of your virtues.

486
00:57:35,649 --> 00:57:37,489
And whatever people may try

487
00:57:37,489 --> 00:57:39,889
to tell you that "You better do this and better do that"

488
00:57:39,889 --> 00:57:41,849
if it is wrong you should never do it.

489
00:57:40,529 --> 00:57:46,689
Because, now, you are very powerful

490
00:57:41,849 --> 00:57:44,449
Should just say, "I don't want to do it."

491
00:57:51,649 --> 00:57:53,889
and that you have to lead the people

492
00:57:53,889 --> 00:57:55,569
and people don't have to lead you.

493
00:57:55,569 --> 00:57:57,529
Fashions don't have to lead you,

494
00:57:57,529 --> 00:58:00,009
but you have to create fashions.

495
00:58:00,009 --> 00:58:03,729
You have to create a path for them.

496
00:58:03,729 --> 00:58:06,609
It's not that you have to

497
00:58:06,609 --> 00:58:10,569
trod on the path that they have made.

498
00:58:10,569 --> 00:58:12,009
Try to understand

499
00:58:12,009 --> 00:58:15,369
that your own personality

500
00:58:15,369 --> 00:58:20,569
is of a level where you can see so many subtle things

501
00:58:20,569 --> 00:58:24,209
and you are so powerful, that others don't see,

502
00:58:24,209 --> 00:58:29,449
then you have to automatically take up their leadership.

503
00:58:29,449 --> 00:58:31,529
Don't get ideas from them

504
00:58:31,529 --> 00:58:33,169
and don't get frightened

505
00:58:33,169 --> 00:58:35,649
when they try to tell you something

506
00:58:35,649 --> 00:58:38,569
against yourself or against Sahaja Yoga.

507
00:58:38,569 --> 00:58:43,689
Be sure. Be confident. That is how it is going to work out.

508
00:58:43,689 --> 00:58:46,609
Now, I'm just a woman and a housewife,

509
00:58:46,609 --> 00:58:50,009
but I was so sure about Sahaja Yoga

510
00:58:50,009 --> 00:58:53,009
that it worked out.

511
00:58:54,889 --> 00:58:56,369
I didn't have to,

512
00:58:56,369 --> 00:59:00,569
sort of, think whether I should do it or not.

513
00:59:00,569 --> 00:59:05,209
I just started it.

514
00:59:05,649 --> 00:59:08,369
Though in the family it was not so much respected,

515
00:59:08,569 --> 00:59:12,289
not so much agreed to, doesn't matter.

516
00:59:12,289 --> 00:59:15,329
I started the whole thing on My own,

517
00:59:15,329 --> 00:59:17,169
worked it out on My own,

518
00:59:17,169 --> 00:59:20,489
because I had complete confidence in the truth,

519
00:59:20,489 --> 00:59:23,809
that if I am standing on the truth it will help Me

520
00:59:23,809 --> 00:59:26,889
and it will help all those who will come to Me.

521
00:59:26,889 --> 00:59:28,969
It has happened.

522
00:59:28,969 --> 00:59:31,929
So for you, it should not be difficult at all.

523
00:59:31,929 --> 00:59:33,729
All of you should, first of all,

524
00:59:33,729 --> 00:59:36,049
see that you are not a conditioned person

525
00:59:36,049 --> 00:59:38,329
and you do not have an ego

526
00:59:38,329 --> 00:59:41,209
and then you should go ahead with it

527
00:59:41,209 --> 00:59:44,569
and you'll be amazed how things will work out.

528
00:59:44,569 --> 00:59:48,329
Today's puja is very short puja.

529
00:59:48,609 --> 00:59:52,809
That's why I gave you a long lecture.

530
00:59:53,169 --> 00:59:56,449
There are so many things which I cannot,

531
00:59:56,449 --> 01:00:02,209
at this time, which is short, tell you

532
01:00:02,209 --> 01:00:05,169
but if you sit down, you can easily make

533
01:00:05,169 --> 01:00:09,289
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight yourself.

534
01:00:09,289 --> 01:00:12,649
So, now put your mind to it

535
01:00:12,649 --> 01:00:17,169
in a way that you are the organizer.

536
01:00:17,169 --> 01:00:19,929
Then what should you do? What can you do?

537
01:00:19,929 --> 01:00:21,209
What are you going to achieve?

538
01:00:21,209 --> 01:00:25,849
Please try and it will work out.

539
01:00:26,529 --> 01:00:28,329
All of you can do it.

540
01:00:28,329 --> 01:00:31,369
I think best is to make a diary for yourself

541
01:00:31,369 --> 01:00:34,409
and write it down in that: what you have done,

542
01:00:34,409 --> 01:00:36,489
how many people you have given realization,

543
01:00:36,489 --> 01:00:41,129
how many got cured, what do you think about them.

544
01:00:41,129 --> 01:00:43,689
But now, if there's no diary,

545
01:00:43,689 --> 01:00:45,009
Sahaja yogis can say among,

546
01:00:45,009 --> 01:00:48,089
"Mother, we have no diary, so we'll start it tomorrow." No,

547
01:00:48,089 --> 01:00:51,129
you start it today.

548
01:00:52,849 --> 01:00:55,489
Only trouble with Sahaja yogis

549
01:00:55,489 --> 01:00:59,409
is that they take things little lightly.

550
01:01:02,449 --> 01:01:06,809
Of course, that is their character.

551
01:01:06,809 --> 01:01:10,369
But not Sahaja Yoga.

552
01:01:10,369 --> 01:01:12,649
Other things you can take lightly.

553
01:01:12,649 --> 01:01:14,409
If somebody shouts at you,

554
01:01:14,409 --> 01:01:15,889
somebody gets angry with you,

555
01:01:15,889 --> 01:01:18,449
somebody even slaps you, take it lightly.

556
01:01:18,449 --> 01:01:21,409
Doesn't matter, makes no difference to you,

557
01:01:21,409 --> 01:01:23,369
because you are the spirit.

558
01:01:23,369 --> 01:01:24,969
Nothing can destroy the spirit.

559
01:01:24,969 --> 01:01:27,849
Nainam Chidanti Shastrani.

560
01:01:29,649 --> 01:01:32,209
But when it comes to Sahaja Yoga,

561
01:01:32,209 --> 01:01:34,489
your attitude should be different.

562
01:01:34,489 --> 01:01:36,689
If you are relaxing on one side,

563
01:01:36,889 --> 01:01:40,049
another side you have to be dynamic

564
01:01:40,049 --> 01:01:42,929
and that side is where you have to put forward

565
01:01:42,929 --> 01:01:44,489
the theories of Sahaja Yoga,

566
01:01:44,489 --> 01:01:46,249
when you have to talk to people,

567
01:01:46,249 --> 01:01:48,529
you have to organize a press conference

568
01:01:48,529 --> 01:01:50,649
or whatever sort of thing you want to do.

569
01:01:50,649 --> 01:01:52,649
At whatever level you want to work it out,

570
01:01:52,649 --> 01:01:55,089
please make a proper plan about it

571
01:01:55,089 --> 01:01:57,209
and just do it.

572
01:01:57,209 --> 01:02:01,569
It will all work out. I'm sure it will work out.

573
01:02:01,889 --> 01:02:07,249
With all these ideas that I have,

574
01:02:08,369 --> 01:02:11,369
you have many more

575
01:02:11,369 --> 01:02:15,329
and I hope by next year,

576
01:02:15,329 --> 01:02:18,049
we'll see manifestation of those.

577
01:02:18,049 --> 01:02:20,209
I hope many people will write books

578
01:02:20,209 --> 01:02:22,529
like U.C. Rai has written.

579
01:02:22,529 --> 01:02:28,449
I'm sure books can be written by every doctor.

580
01:02:28,449 --> 01:02:31,289
Doctor U.C. Rai has worked single-handed.

581
01:02:31,289 --> 01:02:34,009
Everything he has done single-handed.

582
01:02:34,009 --> 01:02:36,729
So beautifully he has worked it out.

583
01:02:36,729 --> 01:02:42,209
So, everybody can publish a book with their experiences,

584
01:02:42,489 --> 01:02:45,489
with their understanding of Sahaja Yoga,

585
01:02:45,289 --> 01:02:48,449
which will help Sahaja yogis also.

586
01:02:48,529 --> 01:02:53,569
But it should be honest, very honest book.

587
01:02:53,569 --> 01:02:56,969
I'm sure such a book will be very much appreciated

588
01:02:56,969 --> 01:03:01,569
in Sahaja Yoga and we would like to publish such books also.

589
01:03:01,569 --> 01:03:03,769
All those who have such ideas

590
01:03:03,769 --> 01:03:09,369
should make an effort to create some new books,

591
01:03:09,369 --> 01:03:14,609
some new ideas, some new creation.

592
01:03:14,609 --> 01:03:16,649
Is very important

593
01:03:16,649 --> 01:03:18,689
because in these modern times

594
01:03:18,689 --> 01:03:21,969
people want to do something new,

595
01:03:21,969 --> 01:03:24,889
something novel.

596
01:03:25,489 --> 01:03:27,689
Under these circumstances,

597
01:03:27,689 --> 01:03:30,489
I'm sure you all will work out.

598
01:03:31,129 --> 01:03:34,569
So, all the time we have to think about Sahaja Yoga

599
01:03:34,569 --> 01:03:39,689
and jot it down whatever ideas are coming into your mind

600
01:03:39,689 --> 01:03:43,529
and then these can be properly put together,

601
01:03:43,529 --> 01:03:47,489
making a beautiful book of Sahaja Yoga.

602
01:03:47,489 --> 01:03:50,489
Ladies also have lots of chances of doing

603
01:03:50,489 --> 01:03:53,769
so many things for Sahaja Yoga.

604
01:03:57,849 --> 01:04:01,409
This is a very opportune time.

605
01:04:01,769 --> 01:04:10,489
I think Satya Yuga is starting from tomorrow. No doubt.

606
01:04:27,729 --> 01:04:31,529
And what will be the symptom

607
01:04:31,529 --> 01:04:37,449
that now the satya will be victorious, vijaya.

608
01:04:46,209 --> 01:04:48,489
Whatever people may try,

609
01:04:48,489 --> 01:04:51,409
ultimately satya will be vijaya.

610
01:04:51,409 --> 01:04:52,889
Satyame vijayate.

611
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:57,809
That's going to happen and you are responsible.

612
01:05:00,899 --> 01:05:03,939
For this I congratulate you again and again.

613
01:05:03,939 --> 01:05:07,619
And I hope you will have the commitment to do that.

614
01:05:07,619 --> 01:05:11,179
May God bless you all.
