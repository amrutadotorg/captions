00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.540
According to the calendar,

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:17.300
this year there are ten days of Navaratri,

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.500
not of nine.

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.540
Nine are the days,

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.260
in the night,

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:33.540
when the Goddess had to fight the demons

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:42.780
and to save Her children from the effects of negativity.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.020
On one side,

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.700
She was ocean of love and compassion,

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.740
and on the other side,

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.900
She was protecting them like a tigress.

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.300
Because the times

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:12.740
were such that nobody could meditate,

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.860
nobody could take the name of God,

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.420
nobody could think even of Self-Realisation.

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.860
But those who are sitting here today,

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.060
you have been there also in those days,

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:35.580
and you were all saved for today, for this day,

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.100
so that you can achieve your Self Realisation.

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.820
The form of the Goddess in those days

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.340
was not Maya Swarupi.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.180
She was in Her real form,

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:57.540
and that created a great awe,

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.980
even among the disciples.

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.820
So the question of giving them

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.580
Self Realisation was not there.

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.660
First of all, they were to be saved.

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.140
So like nine months the mother has to keep the child

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.700
in her womb, for these nine months,

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.580
or you can say nine yugas, nine times,

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.980
you all have been saved properly,

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:32.100
and on the tenth month you are given your birth.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.100
Also this birth is always after seven days of nine months.

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.380
So we had to wait

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.340
for some time till it matures.

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.620
Now the tenth Navaratri today

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:50.820
is to celebrate actually the Adi Shakti.

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.860
So today we are really going to worship the Adi Shakti.

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.180
On one side the Adi Shakti is Mahakali,

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.100
on the other side, She is Mahasaraswati,

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.780
in the centre She is Mahalakshmi,

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.140
and also She is the Amba,

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.380
the One Who is the Kundalini.

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.740
But She is also beyond that.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:22.580
She's parashakti;

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.700
She's beyond all the powers.

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.020
Because She is the generator of power.

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.100
So, She has to be beyond all that.

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.900
So today when we are worshipping Her,

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.060
we have to worship Her in all these forms.

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:43.580
So you understand that the tenth day

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.900
that we are having Navaratri for the first time

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.540
in the calendar is because

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:54.460
today is the day when we are worshipping Adi Shakti.

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.540
Adi Shakti was never worshipped before, never.

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:02.660
But, this time, when I went to Calcutta,

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:08.580
I told them that "You better worship Adi Shakti today."

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.660
And they were surprised,

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.940
"Why today Mother is asking

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.740
for Adi Shakti to be worshipped?"

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.020
So when I went back to Poona,

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.100
they told Me that Adi Shakti, as you know,

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.220
is the Saptashringi,

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.980
means the One with seven peaks.

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:30.980
She rests on the seven peaks,

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:36.940
means on the Sahasrara, on the seven, seven chakras.

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:39.940
She rules all the seven chakras.

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:47.100
They told me that when we had the puja in Calcutta,

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:50.500
same time, that's the only time

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:53.580
when those who follow Saptashringi,

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:58.740
which are very few people, all of them come there,

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.420
and there they come, first of all

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.620
the people from Her mother's side come down.

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:10.580
So the mother's side of the Adi Shakti

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:15.700
are regarded as Vaishnavites, the one who follow Vishnu.

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:18.580
So they come first there to worship Her,

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:20.820
and then the father-in-law's side,

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:24.860
that is Shiva's side, comes in, Sadashiva's side.

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:28.980
That's exactly that time when we had the puja.

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.700
They have these two groups together to worship.

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:38.660
So now we have among ourselves people of two types.

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:42.660
One are, we can call the one who worship Brahmadeva

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:44.580
on the right hand side,

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:49.020
and the people who worship Shiva on the left hand side.

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:55.620
Both sides have to meet at a point,

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:57.740
and that point has come,

00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:59.780
that we have to worship

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:04.980
the complete integrated form of all these powers,

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:08.820
which has manifested within us.

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:11.140
Now when they say there is only one God,

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:13.020
all right there is one God.

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:15.300
But one God has got a head,

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:17.620
He's got His liver,

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:19.740
He's got His stomach,

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:21.380
He's got His nose.

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:23.020
He's got everything.

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:25.980
Just like as human beings are.

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:27.620
Because they say so,

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:30.580
that God made human beings in their own image.

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:33.260
So then He has different parts in the bodies,

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:35.940
and He has to run those different parts.

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:37.860
And for these different parts,

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:39.700
He has to have Deities,

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:41.980
and these Deities are to be understood.

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:44.700
And unless und until you understand

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:46.420
and worship those Deities,

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:50.060
you cannot awaken those Deities within yourself.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:54.380
But they all are part and parcel of the Adi Shakti.

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:58.900
Are completely under the control of the Adi Shakti.

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:04.380
Yesterday you heard about the powers of the Adi Shakti.

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:07.540
It's like

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:16.460
a tortoise takes his whole body inside his shell,

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:18.380
in the same way

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:22.540
I have withdrawn all these powers within Myself.

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:28.580
I mean, you cannot discover them easily.

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:30.980
You cannot find them out easily.

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:33.660
Except for these modern cameras,

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:37.060
which are trying to cheat us.

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:42.300
They are the ones who are giving My forms and things to you.

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:48.100
Because there is light

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:52.340
in these vibrations,

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:55.300
and when these vibrations are emitted,

00:07:55.500 --> 00:08:00.420
you start seeing them in these cameras,

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:02.940
even if they may not be very sensitive,

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:06.060
but somehow people catch it.

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:10.660
There have been so many miraculous photographs, as you know.

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:13.380
One photograph you must have seen

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:16.700
where Shri Ganesha Himself is standing behind Me.

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:20.060
Now you don't see anyone standing just now here.

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:24.980
But you don't know what's happening.

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:29.340
And this is what one has to understand,

00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:36.700
That we have entered into a new realm of God's magic.

00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:40.900
And His magic works, in so many ways.

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:48.620
Of course, sometimes, you also get lost.

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:56.620
Because of your previous problems you get dragged down.

00:08:56.820 --> 00:09:01.420
You get tempted.

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:06.860
Sometimes you get also dominated

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:12.020
by negative forces and you fall down.

00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:16.580
And this is a very sad thing

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:19.820
that should happen to any Sahaja Yogi.

00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:23.580
Because perhaps you do not know your past,

00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:27.700
and you do not know how you have struggled,

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:33.660
how you have worked hard to come up to this level.

00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:36.340
And after coming to this level,

00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:39.900
if you do not try to go higher,

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:43.060
then

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:48.980
either you'll be stuck on the same place,

00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:53.260
or maybe that you may be thrown down.

00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:59.300
So for you to know that you are a Sahaja Yogi,

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:05.020
you are not a wife, husband, mother, father,

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.340
you are a Sahaja Yogi.

00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:09.460
Like I'm the Adi Shakti,

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:11.940
like that you are Sahaja Yogis.

00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:16.500
So "My main job now is to give realisation to others.

00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:21.620
And because all My relationships are already fixed properly,

00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:26.580
I don't have to worry about any Deity, about any God,

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:30.660
They all work out very efficiently, everything."

00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:35.220
Now the description yesterday as you read of the Goddess,

00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:37.860
that Her hands were throwing

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:40.580
all the arrows with such a speed that

00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:43.660
as if one felt that She was dancing.

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:47.100
Is a fact, no doubt,

00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:49.380
but you don't see that.

00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:55.580
You cannot see that every hair of Mine is like an arrow.

00:10:57.300 --> 00:11:00.740
And it works so tremendously.

00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:05.140
But to you I'm just sitting here quietly,

00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:08.020
just like you as you are sitting.

00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:10.500
But it's not so.

00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:12.700
It's something much more.

00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:18.620
Now when they show a lion or a tiger,

00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:21.300
as My vahana,

00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:24.820
then you have to understand that they show,

00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:26.620
actually they are.

00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:28.460
Actually they are.

00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:31.540
It's not that they are symbolically, actually they are.

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:34.660
So the dignity of a tiger,

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:37.540
I have told you many a times how dignified it is.

00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:41.860
Because I sit on him, he's so dignified.

00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:46.100
If he has to eat the meat, he'll kill one cow or anything,

00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:48.900
eat the meat, leave it for others.

00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:51.300
It's so dignified.

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:54.140
And once a month he eats.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:12:00.980
So even to get a vahana of this kind,

00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:05.140
this was to be evolved from amoeba stage to this stage.

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:09.180
Otherwise he would not have been here.

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:13.860
In the same way you are evolved,

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:18.020
and in you are these, all these vahanas also there.

00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:20.980
And they work out

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:25.060
very quickly all that you want.

00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:27.860
You desire something;

00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:32.660
you'll be surprised immediately you'll find it works out.

00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:36.820
You ask for something, immediately it works out.

00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:43.580
But there should be a complete dedication in Sahaja Yoga.

00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:45.540
When I say Sahaj Yog,

00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:52.020
you know that is the yoga of your attention with My Feet.

00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:54.380
That's what it is.

00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:02.020
But if you are still moving with your egos

00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:05.660
and if you are still thinking on those lines

00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:11.820
that "We are something and we can start our own Sahaj Yog,

00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:14.060
we can work out this way and that way,"

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.820
or "My wife is like that, my child is like that,

00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:18.860
my husband is like that."

00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:22.900
You have to give up all these problems on one side.

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:27.740
Otherwise, you will not ascend.

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.820
It was not difficult for Me to give you Realisation,

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:34.220
because you were just ready for that.

00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:38.500
But to keep your light on, you have to work hard.

00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:41.500
Now tiger remains at its own position.

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:43.300
He doesn't change.

00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:46.100
Lion remains at his own position,

00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:48.580
and they are all available, all the time,

00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:50.260
in their own position.

00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:53.420
All the Devatas and Gods are in Their own positions

00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:56.780
with Their own qualities, They are there.

00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:01.900
Nowhere, none of these Gods have described that

00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:05.940
They give you moksha. Except for the Goddess.

00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:09.780
She's the only One who gives you Realisation.

00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:14.100
Because She's in charge of all the seven chakras.

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:16.820
She holds all these seven chakras,

00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:20.900
and on these seven chakras She can work it out.

00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:25.060
So there's a big history,

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:32.300
evolution of all those things even in the Virata's body,

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:35.060
and also in you people.

00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:38.060
So you have to cope with it.

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:40.300
If you cannot cope with it,

00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:42.980
then it won't work out.

00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:48.460
Now the problems we have, in the West, as you know,

00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:50.380
are stupid problems

00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:54.580
which are not suitable to any Sahaja Yogi.

00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:00.060
Attachment.

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.460
First they were not attached to their wives

00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:05.700
or to their children, now they're attached like glue.

00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:14.540
I do not say you give up your children or your wife,

00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:18.780
but your attachment should be with Sahaja Yoga.

00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:22.220
Once the blessings of Sahaja Yoga comes to you,

00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:24.660
they will flow to your children,

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:27.260
to your wife, to everyone, to your country,

00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:29.500
to the whole world.

00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:34.220
Now supposing this is the attachment,

00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:36.780
a very simple electrical thing.

00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:40.860
So if its attachment is not to the mains,

00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:43.740
and anywhere else, what's the use?

00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:47.060
It cannot give electricity to anybody else.

00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:50.740
Is a simple logic,

00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:54.780
that you should be attached to the source of energy first.

00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:57.020
Simple logic.

00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:01.540
And then, that energy can flow to others.

00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:04.020
If you yourself you are not attached

00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:06.900
to that source of energy,

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:12.060
how can that power flow anywhere?

00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:19.660
It's a simple thing we do not understand in Sahaja Yoga.

00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:22.620
And so our attachments

00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:28.420
start getting rusted and we don't understand

00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:30.660
what has happened to us.

00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:34.460
You are not attached to the main source!

00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:40.940
And that's the only attachment you need.

00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:46.740
And then the whole thing will flow to the other end.

00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:51.740
So, we have these kinds of attachments.

00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:59.020
Then we are attached to so many miserable things we like,

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:01.620
which make us miserable.

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:13.620
For example, we are attached, to say,

00:17:13.820 --> 00:17:19.740
some sort of a stupid entrepreneur fashion.

00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:22.940
We're attached to it.

00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:27.420
Whether it is in Sahaj culture or not,

00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:30.420
we are attached to it.

00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:38.620
And all these attachments are not to the source,

00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:40.460
to the source of joy,

00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:42.020
to the source of knowledge,

00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:46.300
to the source of energy which ascends you.

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:54.180
This is the reason why

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:57.140
our situation

00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:02.740
of collective ascent is poor.

00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:15.060
Now the Adi Shakti's work is to give you Realisation first,

00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:22.100
second is to give you life,

00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:24.860
to comfort you.

00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:28.620
If you have physical problems,

00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:30.540
She will look after you.

00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:32.740
She'll go all out.

00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:34.940
If you've mental problem,

00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:37.060
She will try to solve.

00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:39.660
So, She's a comforter;

00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:41.340
She gives you the comfort.

00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:44.780
At the same time, She protects you.

00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:49.100
I've seen many people, even now,

00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:51.500
get frightened very soon,

00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:53.700
at the slightest thing.

00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:55.740
Why should you be frightened?

00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:58.260
There's a tiger standing.

00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:03.460
You can't see him, may be today he might be in the picture.

00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:09.580
And your Mother is so powerful.

00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:12.380
You have to understand how powerful She is.

00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:14.860
This is, the understanding is not in your heads.

00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:17.620
Sometimes your wives are more powerful

00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:20.420
or your children are more powerful.

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:23.500
When you know that your Mother is so powerful

00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:25.700
- She's your Mother.

00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:32.020
Then you should be absolutely secured.

00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:38.380
And then things work out.

00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:41.020
I'll give you an example of one gentleman

00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:43.460
whom I met in Madras

00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:47.220
once, not many years back,

00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:50.020
about I think two, three years back or so.

00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:54.100
He was such a seeker, immediately he recognized Me.

00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:57.140
And then he went down to Bombay, posting was there,

00:19:57.380 --> 00:19:59.740
and he received a letter saying that his mother

00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:01.740
on death bed. So he went down.

00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:03.940
The doctor said that "She has a galloping cancer

00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:06.980
and she's going to die in no time."

00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:09.420
He knows, "My Mother is Adi Shakti."

00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:11.380
Just took My photograph, sat before Me,

00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:13.300
said, "Mother, I've nothing to say,

00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:16.260
whatever You think proper for my mother, please do that."

00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:19.460
Just he said so. He's connected.

00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:22.820
They said three days after, "She's going to die."

00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:25.860
Three days after she got out of the hospital.

00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:31.060
He took him down to Bombay, showed him in a hospital,

00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:33.220
in cancer hospital.

00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:35.420
They said, "She has no cancer, nothing,

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:37.820
she's completely cured."

00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:45.980
If the energy is not allowed to flow,

00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:48.580
you are still worried about your wife,

00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:49.740
you're worried about your house,

00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:51.660
you're worried about your children,

00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:52.940
you're worried about this,

00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:55.780
about "my children, my house, my wife"

00:20:55.980 --> 00:21:01.100
this "my" when it drops,

00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:03.900
then I can work.

00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:07.620
But it should not be taken

00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:10.860
that I'm saying you become ascetics, no way.

00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:13.100
No saints were ascetics,

00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:16.260
they all had wives, they all had children.

00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:21.900
But all their attention was at the Lotus Feet of the Mother.

00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:26.940
As Guru Nanaka has said

00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:30.940
that a little boy is playing with his kite,

00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:34.020
the kite is going all over,

00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:37.300
and he is talking to his friends, joking, this thing,

00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:40.460
but his attention is on the kite.

00:21:42.020 --> 00:21:44.780
There's a lady who is cleaning her house

00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:47.100
with a little child on her waist,

00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:50.820
and she's cleaning the house and grooming it.

00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:54.940
She's doing everything, but her attention is on her child.

00:21:56.780 --> 00:21:58.660
Then there are ladies in India, as you know,

00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:01.660
they have three, four pitchers filled water

00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:03.660
and they walk with both the hands like this.

00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:05.460
They know how to balance it.

00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:08.460
They're talking to each other, laughing, making fun,

00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:13.700
pulling legs. But the attention is on the pitchers.

00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:21.500
My attention is always on your Kundalini.

00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:27.420
You cannot play tricks in Sahaja Yog, take it from Me.

00:22:27.620 --> 00:22:30.620
Anybody who tries to play any trick

00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:33.220
will be very badly punished.

00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:37.460
So please be very, very careful not to be dishonest,

00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:40.980
and not to play tricks in Sahaja Yoga.

00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:45.260
I won't do anything, but here they are!

00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:49.020
You see already, with all his teeth.

00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:55.820
They're all fixed quantities, I have told them.

00:22:56.020 --> 00:22:58.300
They're are fixed quantities.

00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:03.180
They know what to do, and they will do it.

00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:07.060
So there is no need to play any tricks in Sahaja Yoga.

00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:11.500
This is another mistake of Sahaja Yogis,

00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:13.700
that they think they can play tricks with Me

00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:16.060
or with Sahaja Yoga.

00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:20.420
When those things come into your head,

00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:24.580
I would say these are demonic ideas,

00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:27.860
because they will destroy you completely.

00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:31.580
On one side Sahaja Yoga is a blessing,

00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:36.860
absolutely blessing on the ascent you go ahead like that.

00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:38.980
You go to a height,

00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:41.700
but you must know also, you've reached the height;

00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:44.060
you have to be very careful to be there, 

00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:46.580
because once you fall from that height,

00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:48.940
how deep you'll go?

00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:54.860
Is logical again to see that you'll fall very low.

00:23:57.540 --> 00:24:01.580
So here you are having the blessings,

00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:06.540
all the beauties, all the love, all the joy,

00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:13.500
all the knowledge, all the friends, all the care.

00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:20.260
And there, if you don't want to be here,

00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:24.100
just because you are playing tricks,

00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:27.300
you want to be here and play tricks, that is not possible.

00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:29.500
That doesn't work out,

00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:32.300
you are immediately thrown out,

00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:34.980
and once you are thrown out, God knows where you'll go.

00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:37.260
That's not our lookout,

00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:40.820
but you are thrown out by these.

00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:48.820
So one has to know that the Deities are extremely alert.

00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:57.820
And They're watching all of you.

00:24:58.020 --> 00:24:59.700
Because They have to guard you,

00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:00.740
They have to look after you,

00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:01.860
They have to help you,

00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:03.740
They have to do everything for you.

00:25:03.940 --> 00:25:05.980
They have to work out everything for you.

00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:08.780
They are the Ones who create flowers for you;

00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:11.940
They're doing all kinds of good things for you.

00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:14.980
But, at the same time,

00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:19.420
They are only attached to Me,

00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:22.460
all of Them,

00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:25.300
not to you.

00:25:26.340 --> 00:25:28.100
Because you are My children,

00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:30.100
They are looking after you.

00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:33.180
Once you try to misbehave,

00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:38.100
you are finished and you go down.

00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:45.940
But the compassion of your Mother is so great,

00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:50.420
that She always tries to forgive,

00:25:50.620 --> 00:25:56.580
give chances and tells those Deities to keep quiet.

00:25:56.780 --> 00:26:00.740
Of course They obey - up to a point.

00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:05.780
But if you want to be nasty people,

00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:08.740
if you want to be cruel,

00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:12.700
if you want to be sinful

00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:15.740
and stay in Sahaja Yoga, you cannot.

00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:18.740
It's not like any religion as you saw yesterday

00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:20.860
that you commit any mistakes,

00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:25.260
do what you like, kill anyone, cheat anyone,

00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:26.740
and still be there.

00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:28.420
It's not like that.

00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:37.940
Here you have to be Sahaja Yogi

00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:41.060
in the real sense of the word.

00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:46.260
And this is why one has to understand.

00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:50.740
There are some Sahaja Yogis have come, they can't get in,

00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:53.060
I think the doors are closed.

00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:06.460
So, now such a tremendous Power,

00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:09.700
so alert, so affectionate,

00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:12.380
so kind

00:27:13.420 --> 00:27:15.180
is there.

00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:24.660
And a Mother, Who is your teacher.

00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:29.900
Mother teaches children with love.

00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:31.220
Not only that,

00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:34.460
but you never even felt how I taught you Sahaja Yoga.

00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:36.860
You just learnt it like that.

00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:39.180
It's a child's play for you.

00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:42.020
It's such a difficult and subtle subject;

00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:46.020
you picked it up without any difficulties.

00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:48.900
So artfully it was done,

00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:50.740
beautifully it was done,

00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:53.900
built in within you, now you know this is Sahaja Yog,

00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:56.140
this is not Sahaj Yoga.

00:27:56.900 --> 00:27:59.900
All this knowledge came to you so sweetly.

00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:02.540
The way you sing Indian musics, you see,

00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:04.700
even the Indians are surprised,

00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:06.700
they can't sing like you sometimes.

00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:09.220
Those who had come to My programme, they saw you.

00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:10.580
Some musicians, they said,

00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:12.180
"We were really ashamed.

00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:15.820
How could these people sing so well?

00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:21.060
And pronounce everything so well?"

00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:29.020
And you have to trust this Power fully.

00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:33.900
Those days, when people were in difficulties,

00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:35.980
they were always attacked,

00:28:36.180 --> 00:28:39.100
they had not got their Self Realisation,

00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:43.020
they had to put their trust into the Divine Power.

00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:45.420
They had to put.

00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:50.740
But now when you have got Realisation,

00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:53.860
you have got your freedom.

00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:57.700
Should never forget that you have to trust

00:28:57.900 --> 00:29:00.020
this Divine Power.

00:29:01.060 --> 00:29:05.100
All the time that It will look after you.

00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:10.820
Now, how do we play tricks in Sahaja Yoga?

00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:16.700
Some lazy lumps come into Sahaja Yoga.

00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:20.420
Absolute lazy lumps, means they must be left-sided

00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:22.940
or whatever it is.

00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:24.860
And if you tell them,
"You better do this work."

00:29:25.060 --> 00:29:26.940
"No Mother, I won't do this work,

00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:29.180
because my right side will come up."

00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:31.380
Very common trick.

00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:39.020
Is a very common trick,

00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:41.020
"I can't do this work!"

00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:43.420
When it comes to work, they'll just run away.

00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:46.220
How many people work?

00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:47.820
Very few.

00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:49.860
The other day I went to the kitchen,

00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:52.020
and I asked this Indian girls what's happening,

00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:54.220
they said, "They are all running away.

00:29:54.420 --> 00:29:56.860
Nobody's here to help us."

00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:01.900
Nobody wants to take responsibility.

00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:05.620
But the trick is that it is played on Sahaja Yoga,

00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:09.820
that "If I do this thing I will become right-sided."

00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:12.540
But if you become left-sided,

00:30:12.740 --> 00:30:14.780
this one is there.

00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:21.060
Is very nice you have put him here, I am very happy.

00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:29.820
So, all lethargic people, lazy lumps,

00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:32.660
always do that.

00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:34.900
Now, somebody is told that

00:30:35.060 --> 00:30:37.060
"You have to get up in the morning."

00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:38.700
They feel terrible about it,

00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:40.500
"Oh! How to get up?"

00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:42.620
But if you go back into your own background,

00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:44.620
you'll say you must have taken drugs,

00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:46.620
you must have taken alcohols,

00:30:46.820 --> 00:30:49.540
you must have taken all these left-sided things,

00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:52.100
that's why you cannot get up in the morning!

00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:55.300
Now, how will you

00:30:57.420 --> 00:31:01.460
finish or neutralize those bad habits that you had?

00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:03.740
How will you do it?

00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:09.420
If you start getting up early in the morning,

00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:11.740
slowly the habit will be formed,

00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:13.940
and you can get rid of it.

00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:19.500
It's just to make yourselves available

00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:22.860
when the morning sun is about to come.

00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:29.820
Alcohol itself is such a left-sided nonsense.

00:31:30.740 --> 00:31:32.780
So much so that once the Goddess drank

00:31:32.980 --> 00:31:35.940
all the alcohols of the world.

00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:40.700
You won't believe, all the alcohols!

00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:50.020
Saints like Sainath smoked all the tobacco of Maharastra,

00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:53.140
but still they are smoking.

00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:59.580
Like Shiva drank the whole of the poison

00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:04.340
because He is the giver of life.

00:32:06.180 --> 00:32:08.780
Whatever They have worked so much,

00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:10.060
so sincerely,

00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:14.220
earnestly with complete concentration.

00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:16.660
You see Me working like that,

00:32:16.860 --> 00:32:19.820
but They have also worked the same way.

00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:25.260
So don't take things for granted!

00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:30.740
I have told many of you to write down,

00:32:30.940 --> 00:32:33.980
what have I done for Sahaja Yoga today?

00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:38.900
For myself I'll do everything - I'll paint my house,

00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:45.100
I'll paint my kitchen, everything,

00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:49.300
I'll have a nice sari done up, blouse done up.

00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:51.140
Myself.

00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:55.380
What have I done for Sahaja Yoga?

00:32:56.100 --> 00:32:59.940
How many presents I have given to others?

00:33:02.140 --> 00:33:05.060
How many letters I've written to others?

00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:08.660
What experiences I have written down?

00:33:09.700 --> 00:33:11.060
Above all,

00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:16.180
how many times I have felt the love of my Mother in my heart?

00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:20.700
But I'll tell you the reason in the West

00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:23.820
why the big problem is, I've discovered it now.

00:33:24.020 --> 00:33:25.660
As I discovered Sahaja Yoga,

00:33:25.860 --> 00:33:27.820
also I've discovered the secret

00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:30.940
which I am telling you today.

00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:43.100
This is also the Shakti of penetration

00:33:48.380 --> 00:33:52.820
that one can find out the demons,

00:33:53.020 --> 00:33:55.540
how they work in our minds,

00:33:56.100 --> 00:33:58.940
how they prosper.

00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:01.860
I think I've told some people,

00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:04.100
but I am going to tell you all.

00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:06.940
When we are children,

00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:10.100
till the age of five years,

00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:12.580
we are ego-oriented

00:34:12.780 --> 00:34:16.660
in the sense that we are just looking after ourselves.

00:34:16.980 --> 00:34:20.100
You give ten toys to ten children,

00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:22.580
they'll take their toys and play with each other,

00:34:22.780 --> 00:34:25.780
don't talk to anyone, they'll just go and play.

00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:29.100
They'll not disturb another one,

00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:30.700
it's all parallel living.

00:34:30.940 --> 00:34:31.820
They won't disturb.

00:34:32.020 --> 00:34:33.620
If they disturb, they might beat,

00:34:33.820 --> 00:34:35.660
they might do something else nonsensical.

00:34:35.860 --> 00:34:38.940
This might be due to some sort of a bhoot in them

00:34:40.700 --> 00:34:41.940
as children.

00:34:42.140 --> 00:34:45.660
But when they are five years of age,

00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:49.500
supposing now, you ask somebody, a child from here,

00:34:49.700 --> 00:34:50.980
"See now, what do you see?"

00:34:51.180 --> 00:34:53.980
He says, "I see a tiger here, and these flowers,

00:34:54.180 --> 00:34:55.620
this, this, all this I see."

00:34:55.820 --> 00:34:57.660
But if you make him stand there,

00:34:57.860 --> 00:34:59.980
supposing somebody's standing that side,

00:35:00.180 --> 00:35:03.060
what will he see? Still he will say he sees tiger,

00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:06.900
flowers, this that. You try.

00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:10.980
Because he cannot see the point of view of another person.

00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:14.100
He's just busy with his ego.

00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:18.460
Now the whole culture in the West, I have found now

00:35:18.940 --> 00:35:21.060
- I don't know, formally it was not so,

00:35:21.260 --> 00:35:25.180
parents had a great grip over the children,

00:35:25.380 --> 00:35:27.380
and they had responsibility of children,

00:35:27.580 --> 00:35:31.180
they behaved well so that children should be all right.

00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:35.340
Not like before the children they go on fighting
with each other.

00:35:35.540 --> 00:35:37.700
I mean, they must be fighting little bit,

00:35:37.900 --> 00:35:39.740
but in the bedrooms they must be doing.

00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:43.740
Because I have not seen films, when I was young,

00:35:43.940 --> 00:35:46.820
where the husband/wife are only all the time fighting,

00:35:47.020 --> 00:35:48.780
or going for divorce.

00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:51.780
No, at all, understanding between husband and wife,

00:35:51.980 --> 00:35:53.820
but when it is another woman or another man,

00:35:54.020 --> 00:35:55.940
their face is going like this.

00:35:56.140 --> 00:35:57.740
If you see on the street

00:35:57.940 --> 00:36:00.060
two people going with each other like this,

00:36:00.260 --> 00:36:04.220
then you know these two are not husband and wife.

00:36:07.660 --> 00:36:09.900
This is modern times.

00:36:10.460 --> 00:36:11.580
These are modern times.

00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:13.500
And the West is the worst.

00:36:13.700 --> 00:36:18.420
So what happens that the parents are also not grown up,

00:36:18.620 --> 00:36:21.620
they are not matured, they have no sense of responsibility.

00:36:21.820 --> 00:36:24.500
They have got children, how to behave with the husband,

00:36:24.700 --> 00:36:26.900
specially the women here are extremely,

00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:30.140
extremely dominating and stupid.

00:36:30.660 --> 00:36:32.420
I must say.

00:36:34.420 --> 00:36:35.940
They don't know anything about cooking;

00:36:36.140 --> 00:36:38.780
they don't know anything about anything.

00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:40.860
They can only career girls, they can go,

00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:43.820
sit in the bank and write something.

00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:45.580
And they're extremely stupid;

00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:47.140
they don't know how to handle their husbands,

00:36:47.340 --> 00:36:50.220
they don't know how to handle their children.

00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:52.740
They have had no training.

00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:55.980
Their mother's paid no attention to them.

00:36:56.980 --> 00:36:59.060
No disciplining at all.

00:36:59.260 --> 00:37:03.260
So this-ego oriented child is still ego-oriented.

00:37:03.580 --> 00:37:06.020
No love, no affection.

00:37:06.260 --> 00:37:08.900
We would say My Mother was a very strict person.

00:37:09.100 --> 00:37:10.300
Extremely strict.

00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:12.620
But she was extremely loving also - extremely loving,

00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:16.900
extremely strict, just like Jagadamba.

00:37:18.020 --> 00:37:20.860
I mean, she would make us cook food,

00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:22.820
even the handle how you hold.

00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:24.700
She would tell us, "This is not the angle,

00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:27.020
it's not the way, you do this way!

00:37:28.660 --> 00:37:30.220
Why are you standing like this?

00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:33.100
Where is your attention?"

00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:35.980
And no questions were to be asked.

00:37:36.140 --> 00:37:38.580
All that disciplining and all that thing

00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:42.740
which came to us in our childhood is today helpful to us.

00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:46.540
And they were extremely loving.

00:37:46.740 --> 00:37:48.020
They were for our benevolence,

00:37:48.220 --> 00:37:50.300
whatever they did were for our benevolence.

00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:54.420
But I think, specially in Switzerland,

00:37:54.620 --> 00:37:57.740
I always felt that the mothers are uneducated

00:37:57.980 --> 00:38:01.060
and they're extremely jealous of their daughters also.

00:38:03.540 --> 00:38:05.780
Our mothers, My mother was very well educated,

00:38:05.980 --> 00:38:07.580
but her mother was not.

00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:10.740
But she was a wise woman.

00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:14.540
She had her sense of responsibility,

00:38:14.740 --> 00:38:16.180
she knows she was a mother

00:38:16.380 --> 00:38:18.340
and she has to behave herself.

00:38:18.540 --> 00:38:21.220
She has not to be childish and stupid.

00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:25.620
So because that love was not given to these ladies,

00:38:25.820 --> 00:38:28.220
they are still ego-oriented.

00:38:28.660 --> 00:38:30.700
They're still babies.

00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:33.420
They're not yet grown up.

00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:39.980
Still they cannot see the other person's point of view

00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:42.900
and they become extremely obstinate:

00:38:43.100 --> 00:38:45.180
"No, this is true!"

00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:46.940
Now let us face it,

00:38:47.180 --> 00:38:49.740
today you have had this Puja of Adi Shakti,

00:38:49.940 --> 00:38:50.820
is a dangerous one,

00:38:51.020 --> 00:38:53.660
because this is like a mirror

00:38:53.860 --> 00:38:56.900
where you will have to see yourself

00:38:58.300 --> 00:39:01.020
clearly, face yourself.

00:39:03.180 --> 00:39:09.180
To dominate your husband is a stupid nonsense.

00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:12.660
Because you don't know

00:39:12.860 --> 00:39:14.940
how to handle your husband, that's why.

00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:19.620
I would say Indian women dominate

00:39:19.820 --> 00:39:22.180
their husbands all right, in a way.

00:39:22.740 --> 00:39:25.260
The husbands can't do without their wives,

00:39:25.460 --> 00:39:27.500
can't do without their wives.

00:39:27.780 --> 00:39:30.540
They don't know even how to pack their things,

00:39:30.740 --> 00:39:32.780
they don't know how to even make tea,

00:39:32.980 --> 00:39:34.540
they don't know how to boil an egg,

00:39:34.740 --> 00:39:36.820
they don't know anything.

00:39:37.780 --> 00:39:40.700
They don't know even how to lock the house,

00:39:41.820 --> 00:39:43.300
open

00:39:48.540 --> 00:39:51.660
even open the wardrobe,

00:39:51.860 --> 00:39:53.300
how to spread a bed.

00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:58.100
They don't know anything whatsoever that is practical.

00:40:02.340 --> 00:40:04.540
I mean I would say that

00:40:04.940 --> 00:40:06.580
my husband would always come and ask Me,

00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:08.460
"Is this tie all right?"

00:40:08.660 --> 00:40:10.540
I mean this is since long, now he knows I'm Adi Shakti,

00:40:10.740 --> 00:40:12.860
but before also.

00:40:15.060 --> 00:40:16.300
He used to come and ask,

00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:18.140
"Is it all right?" "No, no it's no good."

00:40:18.340 --> 00:40:20.380
All right, he would change.

00:40:22.260 --> 00:40:25.780
But because you are not grown up,

00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:27.060
you are not matured,

00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:28.940
you don't know how to handle your husbands.

00:40:29.140 --> 00:40:30.940
You try to dominate.

00:40:31.140 --> 00:40:33.060
And then the children learn from you,

00:40:33.260 --> 00:40:35.340
they also try to dominate you.

00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:42.740
Apparently, you must understand,

00:40:43.420 --> 00:40:45.700
it is

00:40:48.340 --> 00:40:50.820
the authority coming from the top.

00:40:51.020 --> 00:40:52.500
Like I always will say,

00:40:52.700 --> 00:40:55.420
"I am not God, Sadashiva is God."

00:40:55.620 --> 00:40:58.780
Gregoire was quiet shocked when I told him first this thing.

00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:02.180
But I am God also.

00:41:02.940 --> 00:41:05.460
Without Me what is He? I'm His Power.

00:41:05.660 --> 00:41:07.700
He's powerless.

00:41:10.180 --> 00:41:12.980
But let Him be God, good.

00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:19.380
Because if you have to blame someone,

00:41:19.580 --> 00:41:22.540
you blame Him, He's God.

00:41:23.260 --> 00:41:26.740
But I have to work hard to keep Him pleased.

00:41:26.940 --> 00:41:29.620
Otherwise you know, He doesn't care for anyone.

00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:32.780
He'll just destroy, that's all He knows.

00:41:34.340 --> 00:41:35.500
He'll destroy you,

00:41:35.700 --> 00:41:37.620
anybody tries to play any tricks with Me,

00:41:37.820 --> 00:41:41.660
He'll destroy you so badly that for lives together

00:41:41.860 --> 00:41:43.500
you cannot become a human being.

00:41:43.700 --> 00:41:45.860
He's like that, a terrible fellow.

00:41:46.860 --> 00:41:49.820
He's the One Who has done all these things, you know.

00:41:53.500 --> 00:41:55.900
So, we have to grow.

00:41:56.180 --> 00:42:00.060
We have to grow as wise women,

00:42:01.940 --> 00:42:07.860
as women who are like the Mother Earth, as I told you.

00:42:10.060 --> 00:42:11.700
And when you ask me that

00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:14.820
"Mother, You work so hard, and You look so fresh."

00:42:15.020 --> 00:42:17.900
Because I enjoy it.

00:42:18.220 --> 00:42:20.500
It's like a music to Me.

00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:22.860
Doing work is a music to Me.

00:42:23.740 --> 00:42:25.940
Cooking is a music to Me.

00:42:27.060 --> 00:42:28.780
Everything is a music to Me.

00:42:28.980 --> 00:42:31.020
Do you get tired of music?

00:42:31.260 --> 00:42:33.700
On the contrary you feel fresh.

00:42:33.900 --> 00:42:35.780
And when I kill demons,

00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:37.620
as you must have seen there,

00:42:37.860 --> 00:42:42.780
I get more enlightened, more light comes into Me.

00:42:43.660 --> 00:42:45.740
It's the other way round.

00:42:48.900 --> 00:42:53.820
So, I have to make you understand that

00:42:54.020 --> 00:42:59.980
today please have full introspection,

00:43:00.780 --> 00:43:02.700
soul search.

00:43:03.820 --> 00:43:06.820
Find out what's wrong with us.

00:43:09.940 --> 00:43:11.900
Do not pamper your ego,

00:43:12.140 --> 00:43:14.020
because ego makes you idiotic,

00:43:14.220 --> 00:43:15.740
that you must have seen.

00:43:15.940 --> 00:43:17.860
We have some people in Sahaja Yoga

00:43:18.060 --> 00:43:19.660
who are like that, idiots.

00:43:19.860 --> 00:43:22.020
But they think knowing of themselves.

00:43:22.220 --> 00:43:23.260
We all know that.

00:43:23.460 --> 00:43:27.380
We have to have some buffoons also in the circus.

00:43:30.020 --> 00:43:36.660
But we have to have lions and tigers.

00:43:41.740 --> 00:43:45.260
What impresses the people are the lions and the tigers

00:43:45.460 --> 00:43:48.380
and not the buffoons.

00:43:49.420 --> 00:43:52.540
So, it is important, let us have the introspection

00:43:52.740 --> 00:43:54.580
and see for ourselves

00:43:54.780 --> 00:43:58.780
how much we have done for Sahaja Yoga.

00:43:59.100 --> 00:44:05.060
Of course, I have to congratulate you for one thing.

00:44:05.300 --> 00:44:08.500
Because, you know, I am like that.

00:44:09.940 --> 00:44:12.900
I have done nothing to be like that, I'm just like that,

00:44:13.100 --> 00:44:14.740
I am.

00:44:14.940 --> 00:44:16.540
So I'm the Power!

00:44:16.740 --> 00:44:20.060
If I have the Power, because I am the Power.

00:44:21.940 --> 00:44:27.900
What is there to feel very elated about it?

00:44:30.060 --> 00:44:33.060
I do not feel that way at all.

00:44:35.860 --> 00:44:39.740
But if I do not use My Power,

00:44:41.420 --> 00:44:44.500
then I become like a human being.

00:44:47.060 --> 00:44:48.780
Why I am the Goddess?

00:44:48.980 --> 00:44:52.900
Because I use every bit of My Power.

00:44:55.020 --> 00:44:58.980
And if you people do not use your power,

00:44:59.620 --> 00:45:02.860
out of any nonsense, any fear you may have.

00:45:03.100 --> 00:45:07.780
You may have any kind of a temptation,

00:45:07.980 --> 00:45:10.380
or restriction, anything.

00:45:10.740 --> 00:45:15.060
If you're not going all out to use your power of love,

00:45:15.540 --> 00:45:17.900
then you cannot ascent.

00:45:18.900 --> 00:45:21.580
So the whole thing if you see so clearly,

00:45:21.780 --> 00:45:24.820
the whole Power of your Mother is of love.

00:45:25.340 --> 00:45:29.900
Whatever She does is out of Her love for Her creation.

00:45:35.020 --> 00:45:38.500
And the introspection starts,

00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:40.380
but it should not be late.

00:45:40.580 --> 00:45:41.740
I used to say since long

00:45:41.940 --> 00:45:44.060
the way they are exhausting the Mother Earth,

00:45:44.260 --> 00:45:45.580
making so many things.

00:45:45.740 --> 00:45:47.300
You must have heard Me saying this,

00:45:47.500 --> 00:45:50.700
for the last eighteen years I've been saying this.

00:45:51.020 --> 00:45:52.740
Today now ecological problems

00:45:52.940 --> 00:45:55.700
standing like a rakshasa before you.

00:45:55.900 --> 00:45:58.140
Now what do you do with him?

00:46:03.660 --> 00:46:05.660
So you face then.

00:46:05.900 --> 00:46:10.740
Automatically you have to face yourself, your destruction.

00:46:11.620 --> 00:46:14.940
Introspection, if you do not do now,

00:46:15.140 --> 00:46:19.980
you'll face it at a time when it will be very late.

00:46:20.220 --> 00:46:24.140
So don't be just satisfied with yourself,

00:46:24.340 --> 00:46:30.500
that you have now Sahaja Yogi, so done.

00:46:31.740 --> 00:46:35.300
If you have come to My Puja of course,

00:46:35.540 --> 00:46:37.860
like if you fall into the sea,

00:46:38.060 --> 00:46:41.660
the sea has a power to absorb you.

00:46:41.860 --> 00:46:45.140
But also has a power to throw you back on the shores.

00:46:45.900 --> 00:46:48.020
It acts both ways.

00:46:50.540 --> 00:46:53.940
So why can't I go deep into Sahaja Yoga?

00:47:01.060 --> 00:47:05.780
There are excuses also: I have got no time, I am very busy,

00:47:05.980 --> 00:47:08.220
I am working in the office, I am doing that.

00:47:08.420 --> 00:47:10.420
Then you are not a Sahaja Yogi.

00:47:12.940 --> 00:47:15.860
All your time is for Sahaja Yoga.

00:47:18.620 --> 00:47:20.340
But because of that,

00:47:20.540 --> 00:47:23.860
Sahaja Yoga gives you sufficient time to do everything.

00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:31.500
I know of people,

00:47:31.700 --> 00:47:34.380
whom I suddenly find in the Pujas,

00:47:34.580 --> 00:47:38.180
sometimes in Vancouver, sometimes in San Diego,

00:47:38.380 --> 00:47:40.260
sometimes here.

00:47:40.460 --> 00:47:42.940
I said, "How are you here, what about your business?"

00:47:43.140 --> 00:47:44.940
He said, "The business has brought us here,

00:47:45.140 --> 00:47:47.620
exactly on this date."

00:47:50.220 --> 00:47:53.620
When this Power is so great, to realise it,

00:47:53.820 --> 00:47:56.820
to know how great it is,

00:47:57.340 --> 00:48:00.300
then you leave everything to this Power.

00:48:00.740 --> 00:48:03.420
It works out for you everything.

00:48:05.300 --> 00:48:07.740
So today we are talking about Shakti,

00:48:07.940 --> 00:48:11.980
about the Power of the Goddess,

00:48:13.380 --> 00:48:16.500
which are much more to be discovered

00:48:17.180 --> 00:48:19.780
and too intricate,

00:48:19.980 --> 00:48:24.180
very well balanced and extremely efficient.

00:48:26.660 --> 00:48:32.020
But whatever work these Powers have done within you,

00:48:32.220 --> 00:48:35.300
please try to respect them.

00:48:41.980 --> 00:48:46.980
Please, try to assimilate them,

00:48:48.300 --> 00:48:51.620
and let your being grow.

00:48:52.020 --> 00:48:55.020
Don't say that "Now I'm married,"

00:48:55.220 --> 00:48:57.260
or that "I've got pregnancy,"

00:48:57.460 --> 00:49:01.460
that "I've got children, I've got jobs," nothing.

00:49:01.660 --> 00:49:05.580
Everything becomes perfect,

00:49:05.860 --> 00:49:09.700
as soon as you perfect yourself.

00:49:11.420 --> 00:49:14.860
Everything is related to your perfection.

00:49:16.580 --> 00:49:18.540
Then you don't ask Me question,

00:49:18.740 --> 00:49:20.500
"What job I have to do Mother,

00:49:20.700 --> 00:49:25.620
what I have to achieve?"

00:49:26.540 --> 00:49:28.540
Nothing.

00:49:29.340 --> 00:49:34.820
You just see your way through and everything works out.

00:49:40.380 --> 00:49:43.380
So, all the demons were killed,

00:49:44.700 --> 00:49:47.660
they are again back in their own seats.

00:49:48.540 --> 00:49:50.300
The worst thing is they have entered

00:49:50.500 --> 00:49:52.940
into the heads of the seekers,

00:49:53.140 --> 00:49:56.140
because they have come as gurus now.

00:49:58.380 --> 00:50:00.700
They've come as Catholic Church,

00:50:00.900 --> 00:50:02.980
as Protestant Church,

00:50:03.180 --> 00:50:06.780
as all kinds of temples

00:50:06.980 --> 00:50:10.740
and all kinds of fundamentalist and all that.

00:50:11.260 --> 00:50:13.900
All they look like rakshasas also,

00:50:14.100 --> 00:50:16.180
if you look at them.

00:50:17.740 --> 00:50:21.540
And when they influence you, they go into your heads.

00:50:21.740 --> 00:50:23.700
But after coming to Sahaja Yoga,

00:50:23.900 --> 00:50:25.860
even those heads are cleansed

00:50:26.060 --> 00:50:28.980
and you are all right, out of it.

00:50:29.300 --> 00:50:32.220
But then what to do with this,

00:50:33.500 --> 00:50:36.220
with doing all this work,

00:50:36.580 --> 00:50:42.740
cleansing, and giving joy, and everything, then what to do?

00:50:43.660 --> 00:50:46.980
You have to give it to others!

00:50:48.860 --> 00:50:51.180
This is your responsibility.

00:50:51.460 --> 00:50:55.700
So first of all your character, your behaviour,

00:50:56.220 --> 00:51:00.380
your relationships should be so pure

00:51:00.740 --> 00:51:03.660
that, by itself, it will emit light.

00:51:03.860 --> 00:51:09.540
Like if you have a very clean glass,

00:51:09.740 --> 00:51:12.020
the light can pass.

00:51:14.660 --> 00:51:20.780
But also, Kundalini being the pure desire,

00:51:20.980 --> 00:51:25.900
you must have a very fervent and extremely bubbling,

00:51:26.100 --> 00:51:32.860
you can call it a absolutely pouring out desire

00:51:33.060 --> 00:51:36.940
whom to give vibrations, now, whom to give realisation.

00:51:39.580 --> 00:51:40.820
You give it to the trees,

00:51:41.020 --> 00:51:43.860
you give it to the dogs, you give it to anyone,

00:51:44.060 --> 00:51:47.860
and if you find human beings also give them.

00:51:49.340 --> 00:51:51.660
Rather difficult.

00:51:59.500 --> 00:52:01.980
So, that has to be done.

00:52:02.500 --> 00:52:04.940
But whatever you are doing,

00:52:05.140 --> 00:52:10.100
keep attention in your connection.

00:52:10.980 --> 00:52:12.700
But here they are doing Sahaja Yoga,

00:52:12.900 --> 00:52:14.700
and there your connection is loose,

00:52:14.900 --> 00:52:16.820
then what you are giving? Sahaja Yog or what?

00:52:17.020 --> 00:52:19.900
You are giving darkness?

00:52:20.660 --> 00:52:23.620
Your are giving ignorance.

00:52:26.220 --> 00:52:28.540
You are giving madness.

00:52:31.220 --> 00:52:34.620
So, to this powerful Shakti

00:52:34.820 --> 00:52:41.820
you must all the time keep connection, and keep Her pleased.

00:52:42.260 --> 00:52:44.420
Like the protocol

00:52:44.620 --> 00:52:48.580
is very important because all these you see.

00:52:52.220 --> 00:52:55.300
They have the protocol sense, because They are fixed.

00:52:55.700 --> 00:53:00.620
You should also fix your protocol properly.

00:53:04.460 --> 00:53:07.300
It's rather

00:53:13.020 --> 00:53:17.260
difficult or embarrassing

00:53:19.860 --> 00:53:21.980
as a human being for Me to tell you

00:53:22.180 --> 00:53:25.180
what should be the protocol of the Goddess. Really.

00:53:25.380 --> 00:53:27.420
But I have to tell you;

00:53:27.620 --> 00:53:30.380
because I don't want you should be harmed.

00:53:30.980 --> 00:53:33.900
But the protocol must be observed

00:53:38.060 --> 00:53:41.260
and could be understood very well.

00:53:42.140 --> 00:53:45.580
Of course, it's much better now.

00:53:45.780 --> 00:53:52.660
First time they had My Puja, in Delhi,

00:53:53.580 --> 00:53:57.220
they did My aarti with a plastic plate,

00:53:57.780 --> 00:54:01.340
and the kum-kum was kept in plastic boxes,

00:54:01.540 --> 00:54:04.340
and I was so much worried about these people

00:54:04.540 --> 00:54:07.540
that My whole body had shrunk like this controlling Them,

00:54:07.740 --> 00:54:09.820
"Now don't do anything!"

00:54:11.540 --> 00:54:15.780
If you see My photograph you'll see Me very different.

00:54:16.300 --> 00:54:19.420
I was so surprised they didn't know what to do.

00:54:19.620 --> 00:54:24.700
All right, now, please also

00:54:24.900 --> 00:54:30.260
pay attention to your protocol.

00:54:31.020 --> 00:54:33.660
For example people walk just early in the morning

00:54:33.860 --> 00:54:36.900
in their pyjamas, that's not proper.

00:54:37.740 --> 00:54:39.380
You must dress up properly.

00:54:39.660 --> 00:54:43.860
You're going, you don't know what Adi Shakti is.

00:54:44.780 --> 00:54:46.700
Or you know?

00:54:46.900 --> 00:54:50.220
If you know then you are going to face Adi Shakti.

00:54:53.420 --> 00:54:56.100
Protocol must be understood.

00:54:58.380 --> 00:55:03.500
For that, luckily, in India, people have lot of sense;

00:55:03.820 --> 00:55:06.820
also they are sometimes missing in it.

00:55:10.540 --> 00:55:13.940
So, protocol is very important

00:55:14.340 --> 00:55:16.500
because These will be really furious

00:55:16.700 --> 00:55:19.540
if you don't keep the protocol.

00:55:25.140 --> 00:55:28.940
That is extremely important.

00:55:29.860 --> 00:55:32.260
That's why Christ has said

00:55:32.660 --> 00:55:35.060
He'll "tolerate anything against Myself,

00:55:35.260 --> 00:55:38.260
but nothing against the Holy Ghost."

00:55:40.220 --> 00:55:41.780
And also He has said that,

00:55:41.980 --> 00:55:44.100
"Beware of the murmuring souls"

00:55:44.500 --> 00:55:48.860
because if you murmur on My back, I hear everything.

00:55:49.180 --> 00:55:52.260
They're reporting all the time.

00:55:53.140 --> 00:55:56.820
If you do anything on My back, I know what's happening.

00:55:58.180 --> 00:56:04.020
I give time. But then it acts.

00:56:07.460 --> 00:56:10.500
It's for your benevolence, for your good,

00:56:10.700 --> 00:56:15.620
for your ascent for which you have fought for ages!

00:56:16.020 --> 00:56:18.500
You must respect yourself

00:56:19.940 --> 00:56:22.660
that you are seekers,

00:56:22.860 --> 00:56:25.940
and now you have found out the truth.

00:56:26.500 --> 00:56:28.980
So, make a crown out of it,

00:56:29.220 --> 00:56:31.180
and put it on your head.

00:56:31.420 --> 00:56:34.420
Now you are like lords.

00:56:39.540 --> 00:56:41.780
Unless and until

00:56:43.060 --> 00:56:48.140
you know what powers you have and how you got them,

00:56:48.580 --> 00:56:50.860
and you remember it,

00:56:51.340 --> 00:56:56.380
and also this truth becomes part and parcel of you,

00:56:57.100 --> 00:56:59.660
your growth is going to be difficult.

00:56:59.860 --> 00:57:01.700
You'll be neither here nor there,

00:57:01.900 --> 00:57:04.580
hanging in the air like a pendulum going here to there,

00:57:04.780 --> 00:57:06.780
left to the right, right to the left.

00:57:07.020 --> 00:57:10.020
And a Sahaja Yogini should be ashamed to say

00:57:10.300 --> 00:57:13.700
that "I'll go on the left, or I'll go on the right."

00:57:14.500 --> 00:57:17.020
How can you be so vulnerable?

00:57:19.540 --> 00:57:22.100
Because you have not grown.

00:57:23.300 --> 00:57:26.340
You have to be like Rock of Gibraltar.

00:57:28.060 --> 00:57:30.860
How can you catch?

00:57:32.780 --> 00:57:35.660
All right, if you think somebody is extremely negative,

00:57:35.860 --> 00:57:38.140
don't go near that person.

00:57:40.140 --> 00:57:43.940
But you cannot become a dainty darlings.

00:57:49.260 --> 00:57:54.180
My children are viras, shivalrous.

00:57:54.900 --> 00:57:56.860
They have to be.

00:57:57.420 --> 00:57:59.060
You are My children.

00:57:59.260 --> 00:58:02.740
You are no more Christians, Hindus, Muslims,

00:58:03.460 --> 00:58:10.820
you are no more all these horrible demonic people,

00:58:11.020 --> 00:58:13.460
but you are My children and you have to be brave,

00:58:13.660 --> 00:58:15.180
you have to be righteous,

00:58:15.380 --> 00:58:17.060
you have to be good, you have to be compassionate,

00:58:17.260 --> 00:58:19.420
you have to be dynamic.

00:58:19.660 --> 00:58:21.820
That's the minimum.

00:58:23.540 --> 00:58:27.420
I hope after this Puja you'll sit down,

00:58:27.620 --> 00:58:30.420
meditate and do introspection,

00:58:30.620 --> 00:58:36.340
and find out, "Why I do it? What is the problem?"

00:58:37.380 --> 00:58:42.140
Say, some people yesterday were dozing off, I saw them.

00:58:42.340 --> 00:58:45.100
Because of left Nabhi.

00:58:46.300 --> 00:58:49.140
So correct your left Nabhi.

00:58:56.140 --> 00:59:01.460
But if you are really connected with this Divine Power,

00:59:01.660 --> 00:59:04.900
you may keep awake for three days and three nights,

00:59:05.100 --> 00:59:06.340
you'll not be tired.

00:59:06.540 --> 00:59:08.780
It has happened with you sometimes.

00:59:08.980 --> 00:59:11.060
But attention should be on the Power,

00:59:11.620 --> 00:59:13.900
attention should be on the connection

00:59:14.140 --> 00:59:16.460
that we have with this Power.

00:59:16.660 --> 00:59:19.980
Then only. Otherwise you'll be exhausted, naturally.

00:59:20.180 --> 00:59:24.220
Everything's so logical, so logical it is.

00:59:26.580 --> 00:59:29.380
Thank God, and thank yourself,

00:59:29.580 --> 00:59:31.900
thank your luck you're so fortunate

00:59:32.100 --> 00:59:35.620
that you are very few who have achieved this connection,

00:59:35.820 --> 00:59:38.500
and that you are sucking that power

00:59:38.700 --> 00:59:40.780
within yourself so easily.

00:59:41.180 --> 00:59:43.020
And what are you, why are you behaving

00:59:43.220 --> 00:59:48.620
like this ordinary street people with your stupid questions?

00:59:57.820 --> 01:00:01.060
You'll be surprised that Goddess,

01:00:01.900 --> 01:00:05.900
in previous lives, never spoke so much as I've spoken.

01:00:06.220 --> 01:00:09.900
One or two words were sufficient,

01:00:10.100 --> 01:00:15.860
like She said, "Hoo!" and killed this, "Ha!" finished that.

01:00:16.060 --> 01:00:17.940
All these things She managed

01:00:18.140 --> 01:00:20.300
only by saying "Hoo, Ha, Hee, Hey".

01:00:22.340 --> 01:00:26.380
But They never gave Realisation to anyone,

01:00:26.660 --> 01:00:29.060
none of the Incarnations.

01:00:29.260 --> 01:00:32.020
They said, "No, no, no, no, no not Me.

01:00:32.220 --> 01:00:36.100
Not Me, sorry, I'm not going to do it.

01:00:37.020 --> 01:00:40.300
They must have seen human beings how stupid they are.

01:00:40.620 --> 01:00:43.500
"Oh God, nothing. I'm all right.

01:00:43.740 --> 01:00:47.460
I can go to jungle for fourteen years,

01:00:48.020 --> 01:00:53.260
I can do the driver's job with Arjuna,

01:00:54.060 --> 01:00:57.660
or I can get crucified, or I can take poison,

01:00:57.820 --> 01:01:00.740
but don't tell Me to deal with human beings!

01:01:00.940 --> 01:01:02.940
No, no, no, no.

01:01:03.700 --> 01:01:07.380
Is better to go to a zoo than to go to this."

01:01:08.020 --> 01:01:12.180
And that's why none of Them, none of Them,

01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:15.860
and some of Them did not even talk about it,

01:01:16.060 --> 01:01:18.060
thinking that "If We talk, they'll say,

01:01:18.260 --> 01:01:21.140
"Then why not give us the Realisation?"

01:01:22.860 --> 01:01:24.940
None of them.

01:01:25.740 --> 01:01:32.860
So this is the Adi Shakti's compassion, love, and confidence

01:01:36.020 --> 01:01:38.100
that you should have also confidence.

01:01:38.300 --> 01:01:40.620
Not only that I have given you Realisation,

01:01:40.820 --> 01:01:42.140
but I have given you powers

01:01:42.340 --> 01:01:45.140
that you can give Realisations to others.

01:01:45.340 --> 01:01:47.900
None of these Incarnations did that,

01:01:48.140 --> 01:01:50.180
which you are doing today.

01:01:56.220 --> 01:01:59.020
With all Their Powers, They did not do it,

01:01:59.220 --> 01:02:01.060
while you can do it,

01:02:01.260 --> 01:02:05.260
despite the fact the instruments are not so strong,

01:02:06.220 --> 01:02:09.140
not so Divine.

01:02:11.580 --> 01:02:16.940
But still, still, we have to come up,

01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:23.740
and work out in our own lives

01:02:24.700 --> 01:02:27.220
the priorities that we have.

01:02:28.020 --> 01:02:31.420
For the Gods the priorities were only Divine work,

01:02:31.620 --> 01:02:33.420
nothing else.

01:02:33.620 --> 01:02:36.900
Nobody took up a job, nobody.

01:02:38.340 --> 01:02:42.260
Nobody went to university, nobody studied.

01:02:44.780 --> 01:02:47.740
Only thing They did

01:02:48.980 --> 01:02:54.500
was the work of God.

01:02:55.820 --> 01:03:03.820
So you do everything else as work of God

01:03:05.500 --> 01:03:10.460
and that's how the energy will flow into you.

01:03:11.580 --> 01:03:14.380
When you start doing the work of God,

01:03:14.780 --> 01:03:17.700
everything you do becomes work of God

01:03:17.900 --> 01:03:22.500
in the sense that you do the work of God, you decide,

01:03:22.700 --> 01:03:25.260
"I'm going to do the work of God," then God takes over.

01:03:25.460 --> 01:03:27.300
He does all the rest of the things,

01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:30.580
you do only the work of God, He takes over.

01:03:31.580 --> 01:03:35.620
I hope you understand this, try.

01:03:37.100 --> 01:03:38.980
Try.

01:03:39.180 --> 01:03:41.620
Have confidence.

01:03:44.540 --> 01:03:49.660
And also thank God there is Someone, like your Mother,

01:03:49.940 --> 01:03:51.940
Who can tell you what's wrong with you.

01:03:52.340 --> 01:03:54.140
Thank God!

01:03:54.340 --> 01:03:56.740
Even your mothers didn't tell you what was wrong,

01:03:56.940 --> 01:03:59.860
because they were so frightened of you.

01:04:03.260 --> 01:04:05.780
And don't say then - then, when you say something,

01:04:05.980 --> 01:04:08.500
"Mother, my heart catches."

01:04:08.700 --> 01:04:11.180
I mean, what can you do, then?

01:04:14.020 --> 01:04:18.500
If you understand that this is for your improvement

01:04:18.700 --> 01:04:22.940
I am doing it, it's out of love, out of concern,

01:04:24.180 --> 01:04:27.060
then you'll work it out.

01:04:29.460 --> 01:04:33.060
But I don't think it is so much of a mental understanding,

01:04:33.260 --> 01:04:38.500
but it's the understanding of a higher level,

01:04:38.700 --> 01:04:43.420
where it becomes just part and parcel of your awareness.

01:04:43.940 --> 01:04:46.180
"How can it be wrong?

01:04:46.460 --> 01:04:50.540
It's all has to be good for me, everything is good for me."

01:04:53.780 --> 01:04:56.340
Last but not the least,

01:04:56.620 --> 01:05:01.300
one must understand that as all these seven chakras

01:05:01.500 --> 01:05:05.500
I am working on are in a collective way held

01:05:06.100 --> 01:05:08.260
by Me in My Virata.

01:05:08.460 --> 01:05:11.220
The quality of Viratangana is that,

01:05:11.420 --> 01:05:16.500
that She creates this universal awareness within us,

01:05:17.060 --> 01:05:19.140
the collectivity.

01:05:21.100 --> 01:05:26.500
And, if you do not realize that in modern times

01:05:26.740 --> 01:05:33.620
we are in a spiritual path in a collective way only.

01:05:37.740 --> 01:05:39.100
This is what it is.

01:05:39.340 --> 01:05:43.180
Because we have reached to the state of Sahasrara

01:05:43.380 --> 01:05:50.180
and here we have to have a collective working only,

01:05:50.380 --> 01:05:53.420
there's no other way out!

01:05:54.300 --> 01:06:00.220
This is what is to be absolutely realized.

01:06:00.820 --> 01:06:07.220
Anybody who tries to harm the collectivity by bad behaviour,

01:06:07.420 --> 01:06:09.460
or by anything,

01:06:09.740 --> 01:06:11.900
will be thrown out, no doubt,

01:06:12.100 --> 01:06:17.220
but also will fall into wrong hands.

01:06:17.940 --> 01:06:22.060
So collectivity is the work of Adi Shakti.

01:06:22.580 --> 01:06:24.780
Because at the Sahasrara,

01:06:25.220 --> 01:06:26.700
at the Sahasrara,

01:06:26.900 --> 01:06:30.220
at the Sahasrara is the rule of Virata.

01:06:30.940 --> 01:06:33.740
And the Power of Virata is the Viratangana.

01:06:33.940 --> 01:06:36.860
Is the One Who does collectivity.

01:06:37.500 --> 01:06:40.580
This is the most important point we must know

01:06:40.780 --> 01:06:46.220
if we cannot be collective - because of anything,

01:06:46.420 --> 01:06:49.700
jealousy maybe, inferiority complex maybe, any,

01:06:49.900 --> 01:06:51.900
anything which is coming from behind

01:06:52.100 --> 01:06:54.460
like a worm crawling up -then,

01:06:54.660 --> 01:06:56.900
know that something wrong with you,

01:06:57.100 --> 01:06:59.140
nothing wrong with the collectivity.

01:07:00.660 --> 01:07:03.020
Don't criticize the collectivity,

01:07:03.220 --> 01:07:07.220
till I Myself find it out, and I'll put it right.

01:07:07.420 --> 01:07:10.620
Keep to the collectivity, wisely

01:07:10.860 --> 01:07:16.820
and earnestly and try to keep the collectivity together.

01:07:20.340 --> 01:07:24.860
Try to help to keep the people collective to enjoy together.

01:07:25.060 --> 01:07:27.580
Don't criticize each other;

01:07:28.580 --> 01:07:30.100
only criticize yourself.

01:07:30.300 --> 01:07:33.100
If you are in the habit of criticism,

01:07:33.300 --> 01:07:35.180
better criticize yourself.

01:07:35.380 --> 01:07:38.460
It's better, because these are habits also.

01:07:38.780 --> 01:07:41.940
People, specially I've seen people in the West,

01:07:42.140 --> 01:07:43.500
they react to everything.

01:07:43.700 --> 01:07:44.900
If they see this carpet,

01:07:45.100 --> 01:07:46.660
"Uh! I don't like it!"

01:07:46.860 --> 01:07:48.860
But this is not yours, not made for you,

01:07:49.140 --> 01:07:50.700
what have you got to do with it?

01:07:50.900 --> 01:07:53.820
"No, I don't like it!" But it's not yours,

01:07:54.620 --> 01:07:55.820
what's the question?

01:07:56.020 --> 01:07:58.860
It's lying here, why should you be so upset about it?

01:07:59.220 --> 01:08:03.660
"I don't like that person! I don't like that dress!"

01:08:04.700 --> 01:08:06.900
Who are you?

01:08:08.340 --> 01:08:11.180
"I don't like."

01:08:13.140 --> 01:08:17.100
This is not allowed in Sahaja Yoga - "I don't like."

01:08:19.580 --> 01:08:23.460
There is a way of saying things.

01:08:23.660 --> 01:08:27.660
But there is no need to say anything whatsoever.

01:08:33.540 --> 01:08:36.340
So all this kind of bumptiousness

01:08:36.540 --> 01:08:41.300
and showing off is against collectivity.

01:08:43.380 --> 01:08:45.860
Then there are some other stupid type of people

01:08:46.060 --> 01:08:49.060
who are always there to take My photograph I've seen.

01:08:49.820 --> 01:08:52.540
You tell them, "Don't be so forward, don't go."

01:08:52.740 --> 01:08:55.860
"No, I will, I don't do this, I am not. Finished!"

01:08:56.300 --> 01:08:59.900
But they, some of them are really confirmed,

01:09:01.100 --> 01:09:04.980
certified I think, stupid, idiots.

01:09:05.180 --> 01:09:06.780
They cannot be improved.

01:09:06.980 --> 01:09:10.020
But I told you that don't make them your ideals,

01:09:10.260 --> 01:09:13.100
don't follow their images.

01:09:13.540 --> 01:09:17.940
So then, we come to this point,

01:09:18.180 --> 01:09:24.900
that Adi Shakti's work is the most important work

01:09:25.100 --> 01:09:28.380
in the whole creation.

01:09:28.700 --> 01:09:30.660
All right killing the demons was over,

01:09:30.860 --> 01:09:32.780
what is it?

01:09:32.980 --> 01:09:34.020
Done!

01:09:34.660 --> 01:09:38.660
Saraswati's work was done, She created dinosaurs so what?

01:09:38.860 --> 01:09:40.260
Mahalakshmi's work was done.

01:09:40.460 --> 01:09:43.380
She brought you to human level, all right, so what?

01:09:43.660 --> 01:09:47.300
But the climax is now that you have got your Realsation,

01:09:47.500 --> 01:09:50.500
that you have got this special quality,

01:09:51.340 --> 01:09:54.860
that now you have entered into the Kingdom of God.

01:09:55.060 --> 01:09:57.260
So now behave yourself.

01:09:57.980 --> 01:10:01.100
And also you must have that dignity to know that,

01:10:01.300 --> 01:10:05.140
now we have entered into the Kingdom of God.

01:10:05.860 --> 01:10:12.900
I've seen, once I was going to see the President of India.

01:10:13.300 --> 01:10:16.060
But to Me he was another human being,

01:10:16.260 --> 01:10:18.300
I mean, it never goes into My head this presidentship

01:10:18.540 --> 01:10:19.780
and all that.

01:10:19.980 --> 01:10:21.180
I was walking up,

01:10:21.380 --> 01:10:23.740
and those who were walking with Me became very conscious,

01:10:23.900 --> 01:10:24.700
you see, like this.

01:10:24.900 --> 01:10:26.740
I said, "What's the matter with these people?

01:10:26.940 --> 01:10:29.180
Have they seen some ghost or something?"

01:10:29.380 --> 01:10:31.740
Just going on the steps.

01:10:31.940 --> 01:10:35.380
And they were some people standing with, you see,

01:10:35.860 --> 01:10:38.300
spears and things as guards,

01:10:38.500 --> 01:10:41.860
or whatever it is. So, I was just laughing at all that.

01:10:42.060 --> 01:10:44.940
But these people became very conscious.

01:10:45.940 --> 01:10:49.540
When you are entering into the Kingdom of God,

01:10:50.380 --> 01:10:54.340
how conscious you should be about your behaviour!

01:10:58.380 --> 01:11:00.380
How you should be,

01:11:00.980 --> 01:11:03.140
how you should behave?

01:11:08.020 --> 01:11:16.540
Just feel the uniqueness of your personality

01:11:16.740 --> 01:11:19.900
that you are in the Kingdom of God already.

01:11:20.100 --> 01:11:21.580
Just feel it.

01:11:21.820 --> 01:11:23.740
If you can feel only that,

01:11:23.980 --> 01:11:28.940
then you will know what a place of pride you have got

01:11:29.180 --> 01:11:32.100
and how dignified you should be.

01:11:32.300 --> 01:11:34.620
How beautiful you should be.

01:11:34.820 --> 01:11:42.900
How neat and clean and sweet you should be.

01:11:44.460 --> 01:11:48.300
How much maryadas you must know, everything.

01:11:50.980 --> 01:11:59.380
And when you will realize that now you are the coveted,

01:11:59.620 --> 01:12:07.620
or we can say the highest citizens of the Kingdom of God,

01:12:08.140 --> 01:12:14.860
then you have to prove that you have really realized it.

01:12:15.060 --> 01:12:17.460
That you really feel that.

01:12:17.820 --> 01:12:23.140
And you should feel extremely joyful, happy.

01:12:23.340 --> 01:12:26.860
Like yesterday, at the smallest thing everybody's laughing

01:12:27.060 --> 01:12:28.580
like the other street people.

01:12:28.780 --> 01:12:30.020
It's not the Sahaja Yoga.

01:12:30.220 --> 01:12:32.140
If there was a big joke or something, laugh,

01:12:32.380 --> 01:12:35.100
otherwise somebody is talking, you're laughing.

01:12:37.060 --> 01:12:40.100
I was surprised, you're Sahaja Yogis.

01:12:40.300 --> 01:12:44.020
Think of saints doing this, will they do?

01:12:45.180 --> 01:12:46.940
You are saints;

01:12:47.140 --> 01:12:50.220
you are munindras with smanana,

01:12:50.420 --> 01:12:55.460
with your meditation you have become the kings.

01:12:58.020 --> 01:13:02.100
How can you behave in a indignified manner?

01:13:03.820 --> 01:13:06.980
Now, try to assume your position!

01:13:10.180 --> 01:13:11.260
Try to feel it.

01:13:11.780 --> 01:13:16.820
Yesterday, of course, when the last song started,

01:13:17.300 --> 01:13:24.100
it did penetrate, I know, into many souls, to many hearts,

01:13:24.980 --> 01:13:31.060
that unique joy, which we call as Nirananda.

01:13:31.620 --> 01:13:33.620
I did feel it yesterday.

01:13:33.820 --> 01:13:37.780
But keep it up, it's just to be kept very safely

01:13:38.260 --> 01:13:41.940
into your Khumbas, is the Kundalini.

01:13:42.140 --> 01:13:44.620
And She is the One Who has come up.

01:13:45.060 --> 01:13:47.780
So, My idea was that

01:13:47.980 --> 01:13:51.540
today is not only the worship of the Khumba,

01:13:51.740 --> 01:13:56.140
where the Kundalini resides,

01:13:56.340 --> 01:14:01.220
but the Khumba becomes like a flower pot.

01:14:03.620 --> 01:14:06.860
It's like that, that has happened

01:14:07.420 --> 01:14:11.020
and then it can also, as somebody said that,

01:14:11.220 --> 01:14:17.300
"Mother these flower pots also can become table lamps."

01:14:17.780 --> 01:14:20.740
I said, "See, now, you've said it!"

01:14:20.940 --> 01:14:25.140
So the Khumba becoming flowers, and flowers becoming light,

01:14:27.980 --> 01:14:30.940
and the lights with fragrance!

01:14:31.580 --> 01:14:33.860
I hope you'll understand My vision

01:14:34.060 --> 01:14:35.820
and you'll stand by Me,

01:14:36.020 --> 01:14:37.780
you'll come up to that.

01:14:37.980 --> 01:14:42.020
I depend on you entirely for My vision.

01:14:42.260 --> 01:14:45.580
We have to change this whole world into a beautiful place.

01:14:45.780 --> 01:14:49.980
Now for that not much sacrifice is needed.

01:14:50.180 --> 01:14:53.220
You're already blessed, you don't have to do much,

01:14:53.420 --> 01:15:00.300
only thing is keep your attention on the source of Power.

01:15:00.500 --> 01:15:03.340
May God bless you.

01:15:08.340 --> 01:15:10.820
Ah? Thank you.

01:15:11.020 --> 01:15:14.460
Mathias says, "We promise." You all say that.

01:15:26.940 --> 01:15:29.100
Thank you very much.

01:15:45.900 --> 01:15:48.580
You should all write some of the miracles,

01:15:48.900 --> 01:15:52.900
and how things work out.

01:15:53.100 --> 01:15:57.620
Like we went to Paris,

01:15:57.820 --> 01:16:00.940
and they wanted to buy some saris for the ladies here,

01:16:01.180 --> 01:16:04.780
and nowhere we could get anything forty-five inches.

01:16:04.980 --> 01:16:06.740
Either it was thirty-six inches,

01:16:06.940 --> 01:16:09.940
or it was fifty-eight inches.

01:16:11.100 --> 01:16:16.060
Then while going in the car, suddenly I said, "Now stop!"

01:16:16.660 --> 01:16:18.900
They said, "What Mother? In the street?" I said,

01:16:19.100 --> 01:16:21.980
"In the street only there is somebody selling the saris."

01:16:22.180 --> 01:16:25.060
And we got them.

01:16:27.620 --> 01:16:29.500
Another - you have seen already

01:16:29.740 --> 01:16:33.060
in the Ganapatipule Ganesh Puja,

01:16:34.220 --> 01:16:40.580
that how we had a jackpot for your presents.

01:16:41.260 --> 01:16:45.180
You used to always bring presents, very expensive and

01:16:46.980 --> 01:16:50.060
of no artistic value, anything,

01:16:50.260 --> 01:16:51.980
wasting so much money.

01:16:52.180 --> 01:16:56.300
Even national Pujas, you could not get anything.

01:16:58.460 --> 01:17:02.140
And how we got this, just the same way.

01:17:02.340 --> 01:17:05.020
Coming from the airport I just said,

01:17:05.220 --> 01:17:07.020
"Now there's something here!"

01:17:07.220 --> 01:17:08.820
They said, "Mother, nothing there's a shop."

01:17:09.020 --> 01:17:10.540
I said, "Let's go and see!"

01:17:10.740 --> 01:17:14.580
Just we went round, and there all this things at a song.

01:17:15.620 --> 01:17:17.580
Now same thing happened in America,

01:17:17.780 --> 01:17:20.700
I went down, I said, "The China is in trouble,

01:17:20.900 --> 01:17:22.340
let's buy something Chinese."

01:17:22.540 --> 01:17:24.460
So we went to the Chinese shops;

01:17:24.660 --> 01:17:28.620
they were so expensive, very expensive.

01:17:28.820 --> 01:17:31.100
And I turned the corner and I said,

01:17:31.300 --> 01:17:33.780
"All right let me go into a little lane,"

01:17:33.980 --> 01:17:37.740
and there it was, a shop which sold everything very cheaply,

01:17:37.980 --> 01:17:39.700
for again forty percent less.

01:17:39.900 --> 01:17:42.060
Something has to do with forty percent.

01:17:43.580 --> 01:17:47.820
And just by chance only, I think,

01:17:48.020 --> 01:17:51.980
hundred meters away they were selling at five times more,

01:17:52.180 --> 01:17:55.260
six times more. And why it is?

01:17:55.460 --> 01:17:58.420
So now you also try.

01:17:59.660 --> 01:18:02.780
But desire should be pure, understanding should be pure.

01:18:02.980 --> 01:18:04.740
So I just thought that these Sahaja Yogis

01:18:04.980 --> 01:18:07.500
spend so much money, waste so much money,

01:18:07.700 --> 01:18:10.260
and get something which is of no value.

01:18:10.460 --> 01:18:13.100
Because all the presents you give Me, actually,

01:18:13.300 --> 01:18:16.540
I have been asking them to stop it, and stop it and stop it.

01:18:16.740 --> 01:18:17.980
Now from individual,

01:18:18.180 --> 01:18:21.100
we have brought it to the level of national.

01:18:21.300 --> 01:18:22.980
But even in the national,

01:18:23.180 --> 01:18:26.020
I think we now should just have no national,

01:18:26.220 --> 01:18:27.940
but one international, if you can manage next year

01:18:28.140 --> 01:18:29.540
if you people agree.

01:18:29.740 --> 01:18:32.460
But whatever it is,

01:18:33.300 --> 01:18:35.460
whatever you give Me, I'm not going to sell it,

01:18:35.700 --> 01:18:37.180
I'm not going to give it to anyone,

01:18:37.380 --> 01:18:39.220
it should be such that we can keep

01:18:39.420 --> 01:18:41.940
for the progeny to see what you have given.

01:18:42.140 --> 01:18:44.180
It is the value of this is this,

01:18:44.380 --> 01:18:47.260
not the value how much you spent.

01:18:47.860 --> 01:18:50.060
So, there is no need for individually

01:18:50.260 --> 01:18:53.500
to give Me any presents at all, I know you love Me.

01:18:53.700 --> 01:18:56.740
And now, I don't know, I've been telling the leaders

01:18:56.940 --> 01:18:59.780
that "Please don't ask for the national present,

01:18:59.980 --> 01:19:01.460
now don't waste money."

01:19:01.660 --> 01:19:03.700
But I don't know if they are not yet agreeing,

01:19:03.900 --> 01:19:06.780
and if they agree we can stop this.

01:19:06.980 --> 01:19:09.220
And have even international present

01:19:09.420 --> 01:19:12.020
which could be also brought down.

01:19:12.220 --> 01:19:14.460
Because you know, I don't need anything.

01:19:14.660 --> 01:19:16.460
But it works.

01:19:16.660 --> 01:19:18.180
It works.

01:19:18.380 --> 01:19:20.980
Like I said, "You give Me ivory this time,"

01:19:21.180 --> 01:19:23.300
and ivory was so very expensive, everything,

01:19:23.500 --> 01:19:27.940
again that also we found it at a such a cheap place.

01:19:29.420 --> 01:19:31.500
And once you gave Me the ivory,

01:19:31.700 --> 01:19:34.220
you won't believe, I read in the newspaper

01:19:34.420 --> 01:19:37.220
that ivory used to be five hundreds dollars per kilo,

01:19:37.420 --> 01:19:40.900
now in America it is three dollars per kilo.

01:19:42.140 --> 01:19:44.900
It's true or not?

01:19:45.340 --> 01:19:48.860
And also the idea is to give more encouragement

01:19:49.060 --> 01:19:51.380
to handicrafts and to art,

01:19:51.580 --> 01:19:53.380
because so many times I have told that

01:19:53.580 --> 01:19:58.140
a little of a clay you can take and make it

01:19:58.340 --> 01:20:01.500
into a beautiful thing which is worth such a lot.

01:20:01.740 --> 01:20:03.820
So, why should we exhaust this Mother Earth?

01:20:04.020 --> 01:20:07.620
Why not we have few artistic nice things,

01:20:07.820 --> 01:20:10.900
instead of having so many things?

01:20:11.380 --> 01:20:14.140
But if you go in the shops now you don't get anything.

01:20:14.340 --> 01:20:16.700
You don't get silk, you cannot get this,

01:20:16.900 --> 01:20:18.340
you cannot get that.

01:20:18.540 --> 01:20:21.060
So difficult to get anything natural,

01:20:21.260 --> 01:20:25.300
because people have only making unnatural things.

01:20:25.900 --> 01:20:30.380
Whatever it is, in that also you should create beauty.

01:20:30.580 --> 01:20:32.180
If you start creating beauty,

01:20:32.380 --> 01:20:34.260
then we'll try to preserve it

01:20:34.460 --> 01:20:37.660
and use it sparingly instead of having thousands

01:20:37.860 --> 01:20:41.100
of nonsensical things, everything disposable.

01:20:41.380 --> 01:20:42.780
After sometime,

01:20:42.980 --> 01:20:45.940
we'll have to have human beings who are disposal.

01:20:46.300 --> 01:20:47.940
We'll have to dispose them off.

01:20:48.140 --> 01:20:49.340
How will they live on this earth

01:20:49.540 --> 01:20:51.220
if we do not understand that

01:20:51.420 --> 01:20:56.460
we have to live on this earth with its limitations.

01:20:57.620 --> 01:20:59.860
See, I've been telling you, many times,

01:21:00.060 --> 01:21:03.820
take to artistic things, take to handmade things,

01:21:04.020 --> 01:21:05.540
more to handmade.

01:21:05.740 --> 01:21:08.620
Don't go too much to this.

01:21:08.820 --> 01:21:11.900
At least, even if you have to buy something

01:21:12.100 --> 01:21:15.820
which is, say, artificial,

01:21:16.020 --> 01:21:19.540
at least see to it that it is artistic.

01:21:25.820 --> 01:21:31.620
So, the once you have a great desire

01:21:31.820 --> 01:21:34.980
- today is the day they want in the whole world to pray

01:21:35.180 --> 01:21:37.300
for the preservation of Mother Earth,

01:21:37.500 --> 01:21:39.540
that's why I started this topic,

01:21:39.740 --> 01:21:43.260
that we should pray that we all should develop art,

01:21:43.460 --> 01:21:47.500
develop for ourselves, give as presents to others,

01:21:47.700 --> 01:21:52.740
and also to use artistic things, made of artist.

01:21:52.980 --> 01:21:55.300
We can have few things,

01:21:55.460 --> 01:22:00.380
but artistic which expresses art.

01:22:02.700 --> 01:22:04.620
Not cheap things.

01:22:04.820 --> 01:22:07.900
In the whole of France

01:22:08.660 --> 01:22:13.660
what I saw was that into everything this plastics has crept

01:22:14.100 --> 01:22:17.740
in whether it is cotton, whether it is silk,

01:22:17.940 --> 01:22:19.500
whether it is wool.

01:22:19.700 --> 01:22:22.780
It can enter into everywhere

01:22:22.980 --> 01:22:28.100
except for the brains of human beings. It's horrible.

01:22:28.300 --> 01:22:30.380
So, whatever it is,

01:22:30.580 --> 01:22:36.660
in that also see that you buy artistic things,

01:22:38.220 --> 01:22:44.380
not plain, horrible, cheap things.

01:22:44.620 --> 01:22:48.620
All right? So this is what we have to today,

01:22:48.820 --> 01:22:52.780
also, you have to pray to Me when you are doing puja,

01:22:52.980 --> 01:22:57.460
that "Oh, Mother, Oh Mother, please save our earth,

01:22:57.740 --> 01:23:00.340
and give people wisdom,

01:23:00.540 --> 01:23:03.580
that they should behave themselves.

01:23:03.980 --> 01:23:04.900
And they should be conscious".

01:23:05.100 --> 01:23:08.900
And every Sahaja Yogi should be conscious

01:23:09.140 --> 01:23:12.940
about how much energy he is using of electricity,

01:23:13.140 --> 01:23:19.140
of telephones, or of water or of anything.

01:23:20.100 --> 01:23:22.700
We have to be frugal about it.

01:23:22.900 --> 01:23:26.380
If we do not take the responsibility of these things,

01:23:26.580 --> 01:23:29.020
then it will not penetrate anywhere else.

01:23:29.220 --> 01:23:31.740
It is for you to do it.

01:23:34.820 --> 01:23:37.820
You have to take it up in your everyday life

01:23:38.020 --> 01:23:41.860
as a part and parcel of your life

01:23:42.060 --> 01:23:46.980
that you try to save the energy of this Mother Earth.

01:23:47.180 --> 01:23:49.220
Is very important.

01:23:51.940 --> 01:23:55.220
So today is the day they have sent a special prayer,

01:23:55.420 --> 01:23:58.380
of course it's done by some churches of whatever it is,

01:23:58.580 --> 01:24:00.060
but I think is a good day,

01:24:00.260 --> 01:24:01.900
because they must have thought today

01:24:02.140 --> 01:24:04.060
is the day of the Goddess,

01:24:04.260 --> 01:24:07.700
and that's how they've asked for.

01:24:10.540 --> 01:24:13.340
May God bless you.
