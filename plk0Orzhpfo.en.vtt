00:00:06.166 --> 00:00:11.667
Today you all have gathered here

00:00:12.542 --> 00:00:15.917
to worship Me as your Guru.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.500
I must say that I lack many qualities

00:00:26.709 --> 00:00:29.959
that a guru should have,

00:00:31.083 --> 00:00:36.875
in the sense I cannot be strict with you,

00:00:37.959 --> 00:00:40.875
I cannot be stern with you,

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:48.500
and I really don’t know how to punish you for doing wrong things.

00:00:51.583 --> 00:00:56.667
This may be because, normally I think

00:00:56.875 --> 00:01:03.917
the gurus have problems with their disciples,

00:01:04.375 --> 00:01:08.417
who are mostly not realized souls.

00:01:10.125 --> 00:01:11.750
As they are not realized souls,

00:01:11.959 --> 00:01:17.750
the gurus find it difficult to communicate

00:01:18.542 --> 00:01:21.458
or talk to them

00:01:24.083 --> 00:01:29.583
about the subtle problems that they have.

00:01:34.125 --> 00:01:36.999
I know of many gurus

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.291
even in modern times

00:01:40.917 --> 00:01:47.792
who’ve been really very, very strict.

00:01:50.583 --> 00:01:54.667
And also they told Me

00:01:55.375 --> 00:02:00.500
that they have achieved their realization

00:02:01.458 --> 00:02:04.250
by working very hard

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:11.333
and by suffering under the strictness of the gurus.

00:02:16.208 --> 00:02:23.999
Sometimes I was really filled with great compassion for such disciples

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.375
who haven't yet received their realization.

00:02:28.875 --> 00:02:34.417
They had gurus who were really realized souls

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.875
and they never had their realization,

00:02:40.458 --> 00:02:46.500
and the guru was extremely strict with them.

00:02:48.625 --> 00:02:55.875
There was one gentleman I met in Kolhapur,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.709
and he got realization in one minute.

00:03:02.583 --> 00:03:07.667
So he told Me that his guru had "told me

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:16.083
to go for fast every month at least for eight days."

00:03:16.834 --> 00:03:19.583
All right. "Then he asked me

00:03:19.792 --> 00:03:23.959
to build a temple of Dattatreya in his village."

00:03:25.542 --> 00:03:30.542
And every day he must go and worship Dattatreya

00:03:31.667 --> 00:03:35.291
in the morning time and in the evening time.

00:03:36.625 --> 00:03:39.709
He spent so much money,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.083
and still he didn't get realization.

00:03:43.333 --> 00:03:47.291
"And while You hardly took two minutes to give me realization, Mother.

00:03:47.625 --> 00:03:49.750
What is this?

00:03:49.999 --> 00:03:53.542
How You have been so gracious to me?"

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.999
So, I didn't know what to answer him

00:04:01.208 --> 00:04:03.125
I didn't want to talk against his guru

00:04:03.333 --> 00:04:06.875
because I know he is a realized soul.

00:04:12.291 --> 00:04:15.999
Actually, most of these gurus

00:04:16.917 --> 00:04:19.917
and incarnations

00:04:22.083 --> 00:04:25.917
were very helpless with human beings.

00:04:26.667 --> 00:04:33.333
Perhaps they didn't have such beautiful disciples as I have.

00:04:34.417 --> 00:04:40.834
Perhaps at this time all the good people

00:04:41.291 --> 00:04:45.959
who were seeking Divinity are born,

00:04:46.458 --> 00:04:53.542
and they are here as Sahaja yogis.

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:58.792
I never had to work very hard on them.

00:04:59.083 --> 00:05:02.834
Of course once in a while you do get a person

00:05:03.208 --> 00:05:07.792
who tries to trouble us, or who tries to create problems.

00:05:09.542 --> 00:05:15.458
But modern times are so special, I think,

00:05:15.875 --> 00:05:22.500
that it's very easy to give realization to people.

00:05:26.166 --> 00:05:32.125
At the time of Moses, He had made laws

00:05:32.417 --> 00:05:38.875
because of the decadent society of the Jews at that time.

00:05:39.375 --> 00:05:46.375
And that one was very hard, very, very hard,

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:50.750
which we know today as shariat –

00:05:50.959 --> 00:05:54.417
was taken over by the Muslims.

00:05:55.166 --> 00:06:01.417
And even now the punishments according to so-called Koran

00:06:01.625 --> 00:06:04.875
are so hard that you can't believe it.

00:06:05.083 --> 00:06:12.625
And most of the pressure of all their dharmic laws are on the women.

00:06:15.333 --> 00:06:21.166
Whatever it is, even in the Bible if you read Christ,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.542
He has said that

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:31.583
all those Ten Commandments are nothing,

00:06:32.959 --> 00:06:35.583
you have to go beyond them.

00:06:36.375 --> 00:06:40.250
And He says if your one eye is mischievous,

00:06:40.667 --> 00:06:43.542
is committing sin, take it out.

00:06:44.291 --> 00:06:48.417
What's the use of the whole body getting contaminated by that?

00:06:48.875 --> 00:06:55.917
Or if your one arm is doing something that is wrong,

00:06:57.667 --> 00:07:00.083
you better remove it.

00:07:00.709 --> 00:07:05.667
Because of one arm, the whole body will suffer.

00:07:06.458 --> 00:07:12.083
He said that, it is said that you should not be adulterous.

00:07:12.333 --> 00:07:18.375
But I would say that you should not have eyes

00:07:19.166 --> 00:07:23.458
in which for any woman you have desire-

00:07:23.667 --> 00:07:26.166
you have committed the great sin;

00:07:26.417 --> 00:07:29.333
and you'll all go to hell, all those people who will do it.

00:07:29.917 --> 00:07:34.083
So you should not have adulterous eyes.

00:07:35.583 --> 00:07:38.542
Another thing He has said,

00:07:38.999 --> 00:07:42.000
that if somebody slaps you on one face,

00:07:42.583 --> 00:07:51.166
you should turn another cheek towards that person.

00:07:53.291 --> 00:07:57.792
When I knew about these laws I said,

00:07:57.999 --> 00:08:01.041
How can you have such people in this world?

00:08:01.458 --> 00:08:03.959
It's a very subtle thing.

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:07.999
And the last of all which was very, very good was

00:08:08.166 --> 00:08:11.583
that you should be righteous,

00:08:12.291 --> 00:08:18.250
righteous more than all the scribes and all the Pharisees

00:08:18.458 --> 00:08:20.333
– means the priest and all this with the –

00:08:20.542 --> 00:08:23.792
you have to be much more righteous than them.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.458
I mean, in early age when I read it I thought,

00:08:28.667 --> 00:08:31.583
where can you find such people

00:08:32.083 --> 00:08:38.166
who can be called anywhere near Christ's description?

00:08:38.583 --> 00:08:43.458
It was inconceivable at that time.

00:08:44.208 --> 00:08:50.917
India is one place as I told you, people are dharmic by their own,

00:08:51.208 --> 00:08:54.041
we can say,

00:08:54.250 --> 00:09:00.999
their own genes you can call them,

00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:07.500
or you can say they are extremely dharmic because of traditions -

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:09.834
brought up like that.

00:09:10.041 --> 00:09:15.250
In My time, in the South India and Maharashtra,

00:09:16.208 --> 00:09:19.417
I think we were very dharmic family,

00:09:19.709 --> 00:09:23.166
and it was very dharmic atmosphere.

00:09:23.417 --> 00:09:25.999
Still,

00:09:26.208 --> 00:09:32.583
these things that Christ has described was not there.

00:09:33.041 --> 00:09:38.333
For example, anger was regarded as a great asset.

00:09:38.542 --> 00:09:40.875
People used to boast, “I am very angry with that person!”

00:09:41.041 --> 00:09:42.250
they used to say.

00:09:44.709 --> 00:09:46.375
Very common.

00:09:46.583 --> 00:09:49.166
Of course I don't think in India anybody can say

00:09:49.375 --> 00:09:53.041
“I hate you” because is regarded something sinful and stupid,

00:09:53.458 --> 00:09:58.000
because to hate somebody is being adharmic.

00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:03.542
But of course they did say so many things

00:10:04.041 --> 00:10:11.083
that were not at all permissible by the laws of Christ.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.917
And then came Mohammed Sahib,

00:10:18.125 --> 00:10:21.709
who just found that nothing works out.

00:10:22.125 --> 00:10:26.667
So I think they adopted shariat - but not Mohammed Sahib -

00:10:26.875 --> 00:10:30.458
but they had adopted already the shariat.

00:10:31.458 --> 00:10:33.417
He accepted.

00:10:33.709 --> 00:10:36.667
He said, “All right, this shariat can be worked out."

00:10:36.875 --> 00:10:40.875
But it is so inhuman and has no balance,

00:10:41.041 --> 00:10:47.291
because only the women have to suffer; no, nothing to men.

00:10:47.834 --> 00:10:52.792
If a woman did adultery then she was punished, but not the man.

00:10:53.709 --> 00:10:55.999
Even, I don't know what is the law here,

00:10:56.166 --> 00:11:01.000
but in India if a woman who is married does adultery,

00:11:01.208 --> 00:11:03.959
such a man has to be punished,

00:11:04.208 --> 00:11:10.041
but if the married man does adultery there is no punishment.

00:11:11.083 --> 00:11:19.500
All these things, I know, cannot be forced on anyone.

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:21.917
Whatever Christ must have said,

00:11:22.083 --> 00:11:25.959
He must have said in His own meditative mood.

00:11:26.458 --> 00:11:28.999
He was surrounded by people

00:11:29.166 --> 00:11:32.458
who tried to kill Him, and they killed Him ultimately.

00:11:34.083 --> 00:11:36.333
And the kind of people they were,

00:11:36.542 --> 00:11:39.917
specially at that time the Romans

00:11:40.875 --> 00:11:43.291
– extremely cruel.

00:11:45.083 --> 00:11:48.041
So how can He say that if you,

00:11:48.333 --> 00:11:53.083
somebody slaps you on one cheek, you turn another cheek to that person?

00:11:53.375 --> 00:11:58.375
Very angry, hot-tempered people were there.

00:12:00.166 --> 00:12:03.875
Krishna, of course, said it very clearly

00:12:04.166 --> 00:12:07.792
that “krodhat bhavati samnoha” – is krodh is the worst thing,

00:12:07.999 --> 00:12:11.083
anger is the worst sin according to Him,

00:12:11.333 --> 00:12:16.417
from - only from anger everything comes out.

00:12:17.458 --> 00:12:21.250
But He didn't say how the anger comes in.

00:12:21.792 --> 00:12:27.959
He didn't talk about it that the source of anger was your liver,

00:12:28.583 --> 00:12:30.542
and also your upbringing.

00:12:30.875 --> 00:12:36.792
These two things give you horrible anger.

00:12:37.959 --> 00:12:42.917
Unless and until you witness yourself,

00:12:43.125 --> 00:12:46.542
your realization has no meaning.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.375
You should separate yourself from yourself,

00:12:52.583 --> 00:12:58.583
and see for yourself what is really wrong with you.

00:12:59.542 --> 00:13:03.041
Now supposing somebody is a very hot-tempered person,

00:13:03.333 --> 00:13:08.083
instead of taking pride in it

00:13:08.583 --> 00:13:13.583
or using that temper to control others,

00:13:13.999 --> 00:13:17.166
he should try to control himself.

00:13:17.875 --> 00:13:19.166
How?

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:22.291
First is the krodha.

00:13:22.625 --> 00:13:27.291
Anybody who wants to be a saint should know

00:13:27.625 --> 00:13:33.500
that anger, this krodha, should have no place.

00:13:34.709 --> 00:13:36.458
And how do you do it?

00:13:36.792 --> 00:13:41.208
You first of all witness yourself how you behave.

00:13:41.667 --> 00:13:43.709
For example,

00:13:43.917 --> 00:13:48.542
I would say artificially you become angry, artificially,

00:13:49.166 --> 00:13:50.959
and stand before the mirror.

00:13:51.125 --> 00:13:54.125
See your face, how you look like.

00:13:54.542 --> 00:13:56.083
You'll be surprised,

00:13:56.291 --> 00:13:59.375
looks like a face of a monkey or a tiger,

00:13:59.583 --> 00:14:04.875
or I don't know what animal you must have been in last life.

00:14:07.375 --> 00:14:08.291
And then you are amazed

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:12.625
that you are still carrying the traces of that previous life

00:14:12.834 --> 00:14:16.250
that was whatever was the animal.

00:14:16.834 --> 00:14:22.999
Then the second thing would be, take out the anger upon yourself.

00:14:23.208 --> 00:14:29.583
As we have in Sahaja Yoga, we write down our own names and beat it.

00:14:30.917 --> 00:14:37.834
But it is, should be that if you get angry with yourself,

00:14:38.542 --> 00:14:41.083
then you will see

00:14:41.458 --> 00:14:47.291
that you have won over your anger.

00:14:49.625 --> 00:14:52.000
Because angry people only torture others,

00:14:52.208 --> 00:14:56.166
they don't torture themselves. Of course sometimes they feel bad,

00:14:56.375 --> 00:14:58.375
later on they feel “I should not have done this,”

00:14:58.583 --> 00:15:01.750
they develop a left Vishuddhi.

00:15:02.917 --> 00:15:09.917
But, mainly if you start getting angry with yourself –

00:15:10.792 --> 00:15:14.000
“Why should I have done this? Why did I do this?"

00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:17.625
"Why should I get tempted to this?” –

00:15:17.959 --> 00:15:22.834
you'll be surprised, your temper will go down.

00:15:23.417 --> 00:15:28.834
And also physically you should see you have a liver problem.

00:15:29.083 --> 00:15:32.166
With that you just face yourself

00:15:32.375 --> 00:15:35.125
and tell that “I’m going to get rid of this liver problem.

00:15:35.333 --> 00:15:42.083
How dare it become my enemy

00:15:43.041 --> 00:15:47.458
and stop my ascent in spirituality.”

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.083
So the first, the witness state has to be developed.

00:15:51.333 --> 00:15:55.999
For a Sahaja yogi is very important to develop a witness state.

00:15:56.166 --> 00:15:58.583
But normally what happens

00:15:58.999 --> 00:16:04.542
that Sahaja yogis develop a witness state for others.

00:16:05.834 --> 00:16:09.542
Now you know in Sahaja Yoga the door is open to everyone;

00:16:10.041 --> 00:16:13.333
and some mad people also walk in,

00:16:13.709 --> 00:16:16.625
some funny people also walk in,

00:16:17.166 --> 00:16:20.458
some very bad-charactered people also walk in,

00:16:20.667 --> 00:16:23.333
all kinds of things happen.

00:16:23.834 --> 00:16:26.834
So now you should see,

00:16:28.041 --> 00:16:34.083
what are you worried about?

00:16:35.625 --> 00:16:39.959
Are you worried about people who have problems,

00:16:40.792 --> 00:16:46.208
who are no good, for whom you cannot say that they'll be Sahaja yogis;

00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:53.208
or you are enjoying the people who have got Sahaja Yoga?

00:16:55.208 --> 00:16:58.917
This temper sometimes has made people really mad, I tell you,

00:16:59.166 --> 00:17:02.208
can go into your head and can make you mad;

00:17:02.417 --> 00:17:07.333
and we have some mad people in Sahaja Yoga, we have still.

00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:13.166
But they have become so mad that now they are no more angry,

00:17:13.375 --> 00:17:19.333
they are no more troublesome, they are just mad, that's all.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.667
For such people you shouldn't worry.

00:17:24.542 --> 00:17:31.542
There's no need to witness others – witness yourself.

00:17:33.583 --> 00:17:35.750
And I sometimes feel

00:17:36.125 --> 00:17:41.917
that anger comes through too much austerity,

00:17:43.083 --> 00:17:46.583
too much of extreme nature also.

00:17:47.250 --> 00:17:52.834
Some Sahaja yogis are extremely austere,

00:17:54.041 --> 00:17:58.667
austere about everything. It's maddening.

00:17:58.917 --> 00:18:04.709
In Sahaja Yoga there is, everything is Sahaj, it’s spontaneous.

00:18:04.917 --> 00:18:10.083
You are not to be austere. You should not be particular.

00:18:10.291 --> 00:18:12.041
Now, I said now it's not better,

00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:17.125
not to wear a black sari or something, if I say so –

00:18:17.625 --> 00:18:21.834
then it doesn't become a sentence from Brahma!

00:18:22.166 --> 00:18:26.291
Supposing then somebody is wearing a black sari and coming,

00:18:26.667 --> 00:18:29.166
you will all run away from that person –

00:18:29.458 --> 00:18:32.583
or black clothes. It's not that.

00:18:32.792 --> 00:18:35.917
You are gurus yourself;

00:18:36.208 --> 00:18:39.834
why should you be afraid of any kind of person who comes to you,

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.000
whether it is black, white, or any type?

00:18:44.542 --> 00:18:51.250
Why should you have any fear? The another side of temper is fear.

00:18:51.875 --> 00:18:56.583
A man who is hot-tempered always have fear

00:18:56.792 --> 00:19:00.667
because he sees himself in others.

00:19:00.875 --> 00:19:07.500
He sees that "another person also must be having the same kind of temper,

00:19:07.709 --> 00:19:13.875
and he'll attack me," so he's always on the protective.

00:19:14.792 --> 00:19:17.792
In a Sahaj manner

00:19:18.667 --> 00:19:25.291
what we do is to live without fear.

00:19:26.125 --> 00:19:30.333
It's said that wages of sin is fear,

00:19:31.125 --> 00:19:33.917
but I would say wages of anger.

00:19:34.083 --> 00:19:38.542
Those people who were very aggressive, say for example,

00:19:39.083 --> 00:19:43.458
develop frights, all kinds of frights.

00:19:43.667 --> 00:19:47.208
Those countries who have invaded other countries

00:19:47.458 --> 00:19:50.375
and rule other countries,

00:19:50.583 --> 00:19:58.291
and have got the experience of their ego, of their anger,

00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:02.667
become extremely frightened people.

00:20:02.917 --> 00:20:04.750
Specially the soldiers

00:20:04.959 --> 00:20:08.750
who go on the war, kill so many people and come back,

00:20:08.959 --> 00:20:10.583
and they are frightened.

00:20:10.792 --> 00:20:14.917
I asked one of them in America, I said, “What are you frightened of?”

00:20:15.083 --> 00:20:17.291
He said, “I feel that I have killed so many people,

00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:19.291
now so many will kill me.”

00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:21.417
But I said, “Why do you think like that?"

00:20:21.625 --> 00:20:23.417
"Why should anybody kill you?”

00:20:23.667 --> 00:20:27.750
He says, “Because, why did I kill others?"

00:20:27.959 --> 00:20:32.208
"Why did I kill others? Because I killed others,

00:20:32.417 --> 00:20:37.083
so anybody can kill me, isn’t it, without rhyme and reason.”

00:20:37.542 --> 00:20:41.250
Logically I agreed. But his fear was so much

00:20:41.583 --> 00:20:43.667
that when he came in My presence he was just shaking,

00:20:43.875 --> 00:20:47.583
the whole body was shaking with fear.

00:20:47.999 --> 00:20:53.583
So, whatever aggression we do boomerangs on us,

00:20:53.792 --> 00:20:58.834
and we become very frightened about everything.

00:20:59.750 --> 00:21:04.542
In Sahaj you witness yourself as a separate identity.

00:21:04.875 --> 00:21:09.999
All your past is finished, gone, you are not bothered,

00:21:10.875 --> 00:21:17.625
and you remain in a state which is fearless.

00:21:19.542 --> 00:21:24.458
This state has to be achieved through Sahaja Yoga.

00:21:24.999 --> 00:21:30.625
Very easy, once you know that you are protected you'll have no fear,

00:21:30.834 --> 00:21:36.250
and as you'll have no fear you will not have also temper.

00:21:36.583 --> 00:21:39.125
It works vice versa sometimes.

00:21:39.458 --> 00:21:42.166
It's a very common thing I have seen,

00:21:42.542 --> 00:21:48.041
a very aggressive person will be described by a psychologist

00:21:48.291 --> 00:21:51.542
as a man of insecurity.

00:21:52.333 --> 00:21:56.291
It's nice to say that, but it's not true.

00:21:56.500 --> 00:22:02.291
He makes everybody insecured, then how can he be insecure?

00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:07.208
If another person feels insecure with that person,

00:22:07.417 --> 00:22:10.834
that means this man is not insecured,

00:22:11.083 --> 00:22:14.417
but he is over-secured.

00:22:14.959 --> 00:22:18.333
If you tell him that, then only he will improve.

00:22:18.583 --> 00:22:20.583
But if you say, “You have insecurity,”

00:22:20.792 --> 00:22:23.583
then he thinks, “Yes, my condition is pitiable."

00:22:23.834 --> 00:22:25.583
"Even if I kill somebody is all right,

00:22:25.792 --> 00:22:29.083
because my condition is pitiable.”

00:22:29.875 --> 00:22:33.667
Such arguments work out

00:22:33.875 --> 00:22:39.917
in such a manner, that you become convinced about yourself.

00:22:40.709 --> 00:22:43.792
But if you see as a witness

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:49.375
you see, “What have I done so far?"

00:22:50.250 --> 00:22:55.458
"Have I been able to conquer myself?”

00:22:56.375 --> 00:23:00.834
Sahaja Yoga is not to conquer others or to control others,

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.583
but to conquer yourself.

00:23:04.834 --> 00:23:08.291
If you have not done that, you can be self-certified -

00:23:08.542 --> 00:23:10.875
“Oh, I have been a Sahaja yogi, I have been so great,

00:23:11.041 --> 00:23:14.375
I have been this, I am -” that makes no difference.

00:23:14.750 --> 00:23:19.041
Have you completely transformed yourself, changed yourself,

00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:25.709
and now in your presence do people feel secured?

00:23:28.875 --> 00:23:32.500
If they feel insecure, then something wrong with you.

00:23:32.709 --> 00:23:36.709
Or if you feel insecure, also there’s something wrong with you.

00:23:37.208 --> 00:23:42.417
Now this excuse to give, that “Mother, I am insecure” –

00:23:43.542 --> 00:23:48.083
then you are not a Sahaja yogi, as simple as that.

00:23:49.041 --> 00:23:53.792
Giving explanation like that shows you are not even a Sahaja yogi.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.083
So now to become the guru, first of all,

00:23:58.375 --> 00:24:03.667
you should have a great sense of forgiveness.

00:24:05.291 --> 00:24:07.709
So much so like Buddha's.

00:24:07.999 --> 00:24:11.333
Once Buddha was giving a lecture in a village

00:24:12.083 --> 00:24:16.291
and suddenly somebody came in and started abusing Him,

00:24:16.583 --> 00:24:19.999
saying all kinds of things and all that.

00:24:21.375 --> 00:24:24.959
Then somebody told him, “What are you doing?

00:24:25.208 --> 00:24:29.583
He is Buddha, the one who's Enlightened One. He’s trying to help us

00:24:29.792 --> 00:24:33.959
to become good, and you came and shouted at Him?”

00:24:35.333 --> 00:24:38.041
So he was repentant.

00:24:38.333 --> 00:24:43.333
He went to see Buddha, but Buddha had gone to another village.

00:24:43.792 --> 00:24:46.583
So he went to another village, second day,

00:24:46.834 --> 00:24:50.750
and he went and fell at the feet of Lord Buddha.

00:24:51.166 --> 00:24:57.041
Lord Buddha said, “What's the matter?" "Why are you falling at My feet?”

00:24:57.417 --> 00:25:00.667
He said, “Sir, I must say

00:25:00.875 --> 00:25:04.500
that I was, really I didn't know You were the Enlightened One.

00:25:04.709 --> 00:25:08.166
I just shouted at You, said things, I don't know what happened to me.

00:25:08.375 --> 00:25:10.417
So please forgive me.”

00:25:10.625 --> 00:25:12.917
He said, “When did you say this to Me?”

00:25:13.083 --> 00:25:16.750
“Yesterday.” “Where?” “In such place.”

00:25:17.166 --> 00:25:22.834
He said, “Yesterday is finished now." "What is there to forgive?”

00:25:25.999 --> 00:25:30.750
Now, he came begging of His forgiveness, repenting.

00:25:30.959 --> 00:25:36.041
Immediately He said, “Yesterday is over.”

00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:43.917
That is one of the greatest qualities Sahaja yogis should have.

00:25:45.667 --> 00:25:52.208
To call yourself a guru you must also have maturity.

00:25:53.166 --> 00:25:55.999
And the maturity part is sometimes very -

00:25:56.166 --> 00:26:02.375
Like yesterday in the drama. I was surprised when the -

00:26:02.667 --> 00:26:05.166
it took some time, some people came in, went.

00:26:05.375 --> 00:26:11.333
They were giggling just like children. It shows no maturity, no respect.

00:26:11.834 --> 00:26:16.834
Hah, anything laughable is there of course one can laugh,

00:26:17.041 --> 00:26:21.166
or any enjoyment is there - but shows such childishness.

00:26:21.375 --> 00:26:26.291
They are doing some drama, making fun of them.

00:26:28.291 --> 00:26:33.000
Very common with Sahaja yogis I have seen, specially ladies.

00:26:33.583 --> 00:26:36.709
They laugh at things where they should never laugh.

00:26:36.959 --> 00:26:39.999
I am sitting there

00:26:40.999 --> 00:26:44.000
and you are watching something,

00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:47.291
what is there to laugh?

00:26:48.917 --> 00:26:52.250
Shows complete immaturity!

00:26:53.250 --> 00:26:56.583
Another thing I have seen is in small, small things,

00:26:56.834 --> 00:27:01.625
specially in money matters, it’s very funny. I have to tell you this:

00:27:01.834 --> 00:27:05.875
Turkish people, our Sahaja yogis have no money,

00:27:06.125 --> 00:27:08.375
everything was stolen away from them.

00:27:08.583 --> 00:27:11.500
So I said, “All right, you send some shirts here

00:27:11.959 --> 00:27:13.625
and we'll sell those shirts,

00:27:13.834 --> 00:27:18.834
and extra money you can take it,” because they would not take money from Me.

00:27:19.166 --> 00:27:23.417
So when they sent the shirt here, it was - they said that “Mother,

00:27:23.625 --> 00:27:24.667
I don't know marketing,"

00:27:24.875 --> 00:27:27.999
they said, “Mother, it should be twenty-one dollars, twenty-two dollars.”

00:27:28.208 --> 00:27:31.417
Many of them said it is expensive.

00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:35.999
Then I said, “All right, collect money from everyone,

00:27:36.166 --> 00:27:38.875
twenty-two dollars each without giving any shirt,

00:27:39.041 --> 00:27:42.041
finished – for Turkey.”

00:27:44.458 --> 00:27:49.250
But a false guru takes money from you, you don't mind.

00:27:50.208 --> 00:27:53.667
Sahaja Yoga is free of course,

00:27:54.250 --> 00:27:57.709
no doubt. Sahaja Yoga is free.

00:27:58.458 --> 00:28:01.792
But you have to contribute.

00:28:02.041 --> 00:28:05.667
How are we to run this Sahaja Yoga?

00:28:05.875 --> 00:28:09.500
There's no sense of donation in you, at all.

00:28:09.709 --> 00:28:15.208
For a guru, one must know how to donate.

00:28:15.625 --> 00:28:20.417
I am surprised sometimes, there is no sense of donation.

00:28:20.792 --> 00:28:25.709
We got something, say, terracotta from India, to help those people;

00:28:26.083 --> 00:28:29.208
and I was surprised that these Belgian women are so funny

00:28:29.417 --> 00:28:34.000
that they were telling everybody it is expensive.

00:28:34.458 --> 00:28:37.542
If they don't want to buy, they need not buy.

00:28:37.750 --> 00:28:40.291
Others were willing to buy but they, these women were telling

00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:42.333
that these things are expensive.

00:28:42.667 --> 00:28:49.291
Where do you contribute for Sahaja Yoga?

00:28:52.999 --> 00:28:55.917
Now we had to have this pendal.

00:28:56.083 --> 00:29:01.333
We had to have all kinds of things. What do you contribute?

00:29:01.792 --> 00:29:05.709
This attachment to money can never be good for a guru.

00:29:05.917 --> 00:29:09.875
I have no attachment at all. If you ask anyone they'll tell you,

00:29:10.041 --> 00:29:14.083
even My husband will tell that,

00:29:14.709 --> 00:29:17.500
that from inside I am absolutely detached.

00:29:17.709 --> 00:29:19.583
I don't know also, I don't know banking,

00:29:19.792 --> 00:29:21.041
I don't know how to keep accounts,

00:29:21.250 --> 00:29:23.583
somebody keep accounts, somebody does that.

00:29:23.792 --> 00:29:27.792
But this attachment to money in Sahaja Yoga –

00:29:28.125 --> 00:29:31.583
I won't say like Christ that you'll all go to hell,

00:29:31.999 --> 00:29:34.834
but you won't rise much higher.

00:29:35.041 --> 00:29:37.792
You have come for your spiritual ascent.

00:29:37.999 --> 00:29:40.667
I don't say you go to Himalayas, stand in the cold,

00:29:40.875 --> 00:29:44.917
stand on your heads, nothing of the kind.

00:29:45.208 --> 00:29:53.500
But the another defect they call in Me is

00:29:53.709 --> 00:29:58.999
that I never tell them that “you must contribute.”

00:30:00.542 --> 00:30:05.083
It is to be done with pleasure, with happiness,

00:30:05.375 --> 00:30:10.542
that you can contribute something to Sahaja Yoga.

00:30:14.417 --> 00:30:16.875
In any case, whether you give it or not,

00:30:17.041 --> 00:30:19.959
I'll have to contribute for Turkey, no doubt.

00:30:20.125 --> 00:30:23.125
I'll do that.

00:30:25.041 --> 00:30:27.917
Now this kind of a thing as a market is there –

00:30:28.083 --> 00:30:30.875
“It's very expensive. This is cheap, this, that” –

00:30:31.083 --> 00:30:34.333
this is just an excuse because I know you can never contribute

00:30:34.542 --> 00:30:37.750
even twenty dollars for anything.

00:30:37.959 --> 00:30:41.709
So I bring their clothes, all right.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:47.208
They have stitched the shirts, sent it here, and now –

00:30:48.750 --> 00:30:50.041
I'm surprised.

00:30:50.250 --> 00:30:54.792
But if the free presents are given, it's very much acceptable,

00:30:55.041 --> 00:30:59.083
and nobody sees how expensive it is.

00:31:00.083 --> 00:31:03.709
So now I would say that on money matters

00:31:03.917 --> 00:31:10.709
a guru has to be absolutely detached and giving, and generous.

00:31:11.583 --> 00:31:14.208
You'll enjoy your generosity but the problem is,

00:31:14.417 --> 00:31:18.125
you are not generous at all.

00:31:18.792 --> 00:31:24.000
You think Sahaja Yoga is another market-place where you have come.

00:31:27.834 --> 00:31:32.083
So the generosity part is so much missing,

00:31:32.667 --> 00:31:35.999
and it is very surprising.

00:31:37.333 --> 00:31:39.041
They asked Me that “Mother, please,

00:31:39.250 --> 00:31:44.834
we need some chiffon skirts and blouses for this summer.”

00:31:45.083 --> 00:31:47.834
You stitch them for them, bring all the way;

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:51.709
nobody wants to buy, it's all lying there.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:56.750
There's no shopping here. So I'm going to tell you that

00:31:56.959 --> 00:31:58.750
as long as all these things are exhausted,

00:31:58.959 --> 00:32:05.750
I am not going to ask any country to send anything here for sale.

00:32:10.625 --> 00:32:14.375
To believe that you are Sahaja yogis, you are sadly mistaken.

00:32:14.625 --> 00:32:17.208
Your attention so much - you'll go to hairdressers,

00:32:17.417 --> 00:32:23.041
you'll do all kinds of things, but for Sahaja Yoga you have no money.

00:32:23.750 --> 00:32:27.999
Today, as everybody has said,

00:32:28.166 --> 00:32:33.458
“Mother, you should be little stern, You must tell,” I'm telling you this.

00:32:33.667 --> 00:32:38.083
Your progress will be very slow.

00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:46.208
Secondly, you have to introspect to find out,

00:32:46.417 --> 00:32:50.417
what have you done for Sahaja Yoga?

00:32:50.875 --> 00:32:55.875
How many people you have given realization? You have powers.

00:32:56.041 --> 00:32:59.041
These gurus never had powers, though they were realized souls;

00:32:59.250 --> 00:33:03.999
you have powers to give realization, how many of you have done it?

00:33:04.291 --> 00:33:06.458
And once you start doing that,

00:33:06.667 --> 00:33:09.291
you get about ten people, twenty people from somewhere,

00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:11.709
you become great masters

00:33:11.917 --> 00:33:15.750
and you start talking about your great mastery

00:33:15.959 --> 00:33:18.667
and that you know everything,

00:33:18.875 --> 00:33:23.333
that you are the guru, you are the Adi Shakti.

00:33:24.125 --> 00:33:27.083
This is at the Agnya level.

00:33:27.375 --> 00:33:33.625
As soon as you reach the Agnya level you get this into your heads.

00:33:34.208 --> 00:33:37.291
So many, of course, have done so much for Sahaja Yoga,

00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:41.375
otherwise it would not have been possible to see this today.

00:33:41.625 --> 00:33:44.542
For all those who have not done anything,

00:33:44.750 --> 00:33:49.083
I must tell you that you are just standing at the same steps.

00:33:49.333 --> 00:33:52.709
Your kundalini has risen but you have done nothing,

00:33:52.959 --> 00:33:55.667
nothing to give it to others.

00:33:55.875 --> 00:34:00.291
Unless and until you give it, you cannot grow.

00:34:00.917 --> 00:34:03.458
There are many I know who don't want to give

00:34:03.667 --> 00:34:05.750
because they think “we'll catch.”

00:34:05.959 --> 00:34:12.417
Don't want to look after others because they think they'll get egos.

00:34:14.083 --> 00:34:17.792
This is not the way to be in Sahaja Yoga.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:24.250
You have to do something which is very important, to spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:34:24.458 --> 00:34:29.417
We are talking of global peace, of global transformation,

00:34:29.625 --> 00:34:34.000
and what are we doing for it?

00:34:34.750 --> 00:34:40.792
First improve your quality. And that improvement can only come

00:34:40.999 --> 00:34:44.667
through sincere, honest introspection,

00:34:44.875 --> 00:34:51.750
and also witnessing yourself every moment, how you behave.

00:34:57.417 --> 00:34:59.083
I must tell you about Myself,

00:34:59.333 --> 00:35:05.083
that from My very childhood I was like a grandmother.

00:35:06.333 --> 00:35:09.375
I would not tolerate anything nonsense,

00:35:09.625 --> 00:35:14.125
any stupid jokes, anything, like a grandmother.

00:35:14.542 --> 00:35:18.083
And now I am a grandmother also.

00:35:20.583 --> 00:35:24.583
And this maturity has to come in you.

00:35:25.208 --> 00:35:29.875
To talk cheaply is all right,

00:35:30.041 --> 00:35:32.750
some people have that habit – they are no Sahaja yogis.

00:35:32.959 --> 00:35:36.959
But the ones who follow them and talk like that,

00:35:37.625 --> 00:35:39.166
shows that they have no maturity.

00:35:39.375 --> 00:35:44.750
If they were matured they would change all these people.

00:35:45.750 --> 00:35:50.917
Whenever there are matured people, they definitely transform others.

00:35:51.208 --> 00:35:58.208
And their own behaviour, people are surprised how they are.

00:35:59.125 --> 00:36:04.709
This may be exceptional, may be very few like that.

00:36:05.166 --> 00:36:07.999
But only thing why I am pointing it out to you,

00:36:08.208 --> 00:36:12.542
that when you find somebody like that,

00:36:12.917 --> 00:36:18.959
then please try not to listen to such a person,

00:36:19.208 --> 00:36:20.834
not to follow such a person.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:24.458
But such a person is extremely forward type

00:36:24.792 --> 00:36:27.500
and everybody becomes sort of a follower

00:36:27.709 --> 00:36:33.166
of such a useless Sahaja yogi, so-called.

00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:38.375
So we have to mature. Now how do we mature?

00:36:38.583 --> 00:36:40.917
Many ask Me this question.

00:36:41.083 --> 00:36:46.625
We mature by meditation, by nirvicharita.

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:50.250
You have to be in thoughtless awareness to grow,

00:36:50.458 --> 00:36:52.625
otherwise you cannot grow.

00:36:52.834 --> 00:36:58.250
Now, you should practice this thoughtless awareness otherwise also.

00:36:58.458 --> 00:37:04.917
Say you are walking on the road, suddenly you see a beautiful tree,

00:37:05.083 --> 00:37:09.417
you should become thoughtless. Creation of Divine –

00:37:09.625 --> 00:37:12.250
how beautiful it is! You should become thoughtless.

00:37:12.458 --> 00:37:16.250
In thoughtless Sahaj works, otherwise it does not work.

00:37:16.458 --> 00:37:20.999
You plan everything, you do everything, it won't work out.

00:37:21.333 --> 00:37:24.792
If you leave it to Sahaj, it will work out.

00:37:24.999 --> 00:37:29.208
But that never means that you should be lazy about it,

00:37:29.834 --> 00:37:34.500
or also unsystematic – no.

00:37:35.542 --> 00:37:39.875
You have to be alert, extremely alert, because if you are not alert

00:37:40.041 --> 00:37:44.917
you will not see how the Sahaj is helping you.

00:37:46.208 --> 00:37:48.834
I'll give an example.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:52.875
Supposing you want to meet somebody.

00:37:53.125 --> 00:37:57.875
Now that person has said, “I'll meet you at eleven o'clock,” say for example.

00:37:58.542 --> 00:38:02.709
You have to be alert. He said he'll meet you at eleven.

00:38:02.917 --> 00:38:08.083
By some chance you are late, supposing.

00:38:09.083 --> 00:38:12.917
So you should be alert that you are late for the gentleman.

00:38:13.166 --> 00:38:19.333
At that time, you should give a bandhan or raise your kundalini,

00:38:19.542 --> 00:38:23.458
do something, so that you meet that person in any case,

00:38:23.667 --> 00:38:28.375
whether you are late or not. But normally you should not be late.

00:38:28.834 --> 00:38:30.625
If you just give a bandhan and say,

00:38:30.834 --> 00:38:33.542
“I must be there at eleven o'clock,” you'll be there.

00:38:33.750 --> 00:38:36.291
Sahaj will help you.

00:38:36.709 --> 00:38:38.625
But you even forget to give bandhans,

00:38:38.834 --> 00:38:40.625
you even forget to raise your kundalini,

00:38:40.834 --> 00:38:45.208
you even forget to give vibrations.

00:38:45.583 --> 00:38:50.291
So to mature, first of all you should know you are now Sahaja yogis,

00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:55.000
and that you can control the whole situation

00:38:55.208 --> 00:39:00.500
if you are one with this all-pervading Power.

00:39:02.834 --> 00:39:05.125
It's very simple.

00:39:05.458 --> 00:39:09.750
It was very hot, everybody was saying it's very hot. All right.

00:39:09.999 --> 00:39:16.458
I got up, I said, “I'll make it,” within fifteen minutes I made it cool.

00:39:16.709 --> 00:39:20.750
I say, “I made it” – “I,” but it's not “I.”

00:39:20.959 --> 00:39:25.625
My connection with this all-pervading Power has done the job.

00:39:25.834 --> 00:39:31.834
But the connection has to be sincere, strong, honest,

00:39:32.041 --> 00:39:38.792
and all the time in your mind you should know

00:39:39.083 --> 00:39:42.291
that you are connected.

00:39:42.542 --> 00:39:47.542
This situation is very simple to achieve,

00:39:47.750 --> 00:39:54.834
this state where you all the time feel “I am one with the Divine”.

00:39:55.542 --> 00:39:57.250
Because you are not alert,

00:39:57.458 --> 00:40:04.208
you don't want to see the miracles of this great Power

00:40:04.417 --> 00:40:07.500
which you are in connection.

00:40:07.834 --> 00:40:12.375
You are busy with other things, your attention is somewhere else,

00:40:12.583 --> 00:40:16.458
you're looking at other things.

00:40:16.999 --> 00:40:21.417
And then suddenly you say, “Mother, how is it I am such a Sahaja yogi,

00:40:21.625 --> 00:40:26.166
I could not do this and that?”

00:40:31.208 --> 00:40:34.250
What's going on there?

00:40:37.667 --> 00:40:43.750
Even when I am speaking I see people are busy with something else.

00:40:45.125 --> 00:40:46.875
So what you call,

00:40:47.083 --> 00:40:55.875
is to mature through your meditation in nirvicharita –

00:40:56.500 --> 00:41:00.583
in thoughtless awareness.

00:41:02.333 --> 00:41:09.625
Unless and until you enlarge the state of thoughtless awareness

00:41:10.375 --> 00:41:15.458
you cannot mature, because only in the present you can mature,

00:41:15.667 --> 00:41:20.917
and present is thoughtless awareness.

00:41:21.917 --> 00:41:24.709
And I have seen what is happening,

00:41:24.959 --> 00:41:33.250
that people are only expecting

00:41:33.458 --> 00:41:36.917
all kinds of miracles from Sahaja Yoga,

00:41:37.083 --> 00:41:41.291
all kinds of help from Sahaja Yoga,

00:41:41.500 --> 00:41:48.500
but they never think “what help are we doing?"

00:41:53.208 --> 00:41:56.333
"What are we achieving?"

00:41:56.583 --> 00:42:00.041
"Where are we?”

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:03.542
So at the Agnya again,

00:42:03.792 --> 00:42:09.083
you people have to be extremely, extremely careful.

00:42:09.417 --> 00:42:12.375
Now this is for men.

00:42:12.583 --> 00:42:15.709
If you have not crossed your Agnya

00:42:15.999 --> 00:42:19.291
and you start spreading Sahaja Yoga,

00:42:19.542 --> 00:42:25.333
then you can become really a funny person,

00:42:25.667 --> 00:42:27.834
not a Sahaja yogi.

00:42:28.208 --> 00:42:32.875
This leadership business is a myth,

00:42:33.041 --> 00:42:37.417
and this myth must be seen as a myth.

00:42:37.959 --> 00:42:43.208
Whether you are leader or not leader makes no difference.

00:42:44.375 --> 00:42:46.375
But the maturity has to come.

00:42:46.583 --> 00:42:49.166
Now I am telling all this because

00:42:49.375 --> 00:42:55.083
I have decided not to punish anybody in this lifetime.

00:42:56.999 --> 00:43:00.667
So that you see for yourself,

00:43:01.834 --> 00:43:04.583
yourself you understand,

00:43:04.875 --> 00:43:09.417
yourself you realize. I know you very well, all of you, somehow.

00:43:10.917 --> 00:43:15.417
But I want you to realize yourself,

00:43:15.917 --> 00:43:19.375
“What are we doing wrong?" "Where are we doing right?”

00:43:19.583 --> 00:43:25.625
and don't judge Sahaja Yoga on what merits you get out of it.

00:43:26.375 --> 00:43:30.458
If you are not getting merits, there's something wrong with you.

00:43:31.083 --> 00:43:34.083
If you can really understand this,

00:43:34.375 --> 00:43:37.500
then you will become subtler and subtler

00:43:37.709 --> 00:43:44.041
and all your gross attachments will become absolutely negligible.

00:43:44.417 --> 00:43:50.166
You may have concern, but you won't have attachment.

00:43:50.750 --> 00:43:57.583
From inside, this complete detachment has to come in.

00:43:58.792 --> 00:44:01.875
And that can come, as I told you,

00:44:02.125 --> 00:44:06.417
getting rid of your anger, first.

00:44:07.166 --> 00:44:14.333
Secondly, getting rid of attachments to material things,

00:44:15.875 --> 00:44:18.875
by generosity.

00:44:21.041 --> 00:44:24.583
It's nice to give something to somebody,

00:44:24.792 --> 00:44:28.917
you enjoy your generosity, you really enjoy.

00:44:29.792 --> 00:44:33.166
Generosity is to be enjoyed.

00:44:33.709 --> 00:44:39.000
And once you start enjoying your generosity,

00:44:40.834 --> 00:44:44.125
then you realize that

00:44:45.333 --> 00:44:49.750
you, your love, your compassion,

00:44:49.999 --> 00:44:53.458
it has now started flowing to others.

00:44:53.792 --> 00:44:57.834
Little, little things are there.

00:44:58.166 --> 00:45:01.917
I have seen you all love Me and you do want always to give Me

00:45:02.083 --> 00:45:06.375
presents, presents, presents, presents, all right.

00:45:06.959 --> 00:45:13.208
But this love must spread to everybody else.

00:45:14.083 --> 00:45:16.875
You must know about others also,

00:45:17.041 --> 00:45:22.583
what they need and what you have to do.

00:45:25.709 --> 00:45:30.208
If somebody needs something, can you get it for that person?

00:45:30.542 --> 00:45:31.959
Can you love that person?

00:45:32.125 --> 00:45:39.125
Can you give it to the children of other people,

00:45:39.542 --> 00:45:42.750
something that you have?

00:45:43.041 --> 00:45:49.875
If this generosity could be just, maybe, I don't know,

00:45:50.125 --> 00:45:52.917
because I don't have to force Myself to be generous.

00:45:53.083 --> 00:45:54.834
Everybody says, “Mother, You are too generous” –

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:59.750
in My family everybody thinks I am very generous and a gone case –

00:45:59.959 --> 00:46:01.500
but I don't have to generate.

00:46:01.709 --> 00:46:05.750
But perhaps you people through introspection

00:46:05.959 --> 00:46:09.291
will definitely become generous,

00:46:11.041 --> 00:46:15.000
and this generosity will start flowing.

00:46:15.250 --> 00:46:18.999
I've known people who have lots of money, lots of things,

00:46:19.208 --> 00:46:25.625
but not one single pai they'll give to Sahaja Yoga, not one single pai.

00:46:28.417 --> 00:46:31.875
This sense of generosity comes

00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:38.583
when you understand what is your purpose of life, why you are here.

00:46:39.166 --> 00:46:42.875
Just to fulfil yourself with Sahaja Yoga,

00:46:43.041 --> 00:46:49.917
or to be able to do something about it

00:46:50.083 --> 00:46:54.542
without feeling that you have done something?

00:46:54.792 --> 00:46:58.083
In this Christ has said very nicely –

00:46:58.291 --> 00:47:00.625
I mean that He has said it, but where do you find this? –

00:47:00.834 --> 00:47:06.917
that your left hand should not know what your right hand has given,

00:47:07.375 --> 00:47:11.875
should never trumpet, “I, I, I, I, I.”

00:47:12.333 --> 00:47:16.458
What Christ has said, to achieve that

00:47:16.667 --> 00:47:19.667
you had to have realization, no doubt.

00:47:20.083 --> 00:47:25.375
But I would say fifth chapter of Matthews you read.

00:47:25.875 --> 00:47:30.583
Such things, so subtle He did that you'll be surprised that

00:47:30.792 --> 00:47:37.834
how this religion in the name of Christ has gone on the other side of it.

00:47:42.458 --> 00:47:45.583
Now people want to be gurus

00:47:45.875 --> 00:47:50.792
because they think you have powers;

00:47:51.250 --> 00:47:53.917
that you can overpower others,

00:47:54.083 --> 00:47:57.000
you can say whatever you like to others,

00:47:57.250 --> 00:48:01.625
you can torture anyone you feel like.

00:48:04.208 --> 00:48:08.250
That has been before, I know.

00:48:08.500 --> 00:48:10.583
Gurus have been very, very …

00:48:10.792 --> 00:48:14.834
very, very cruel to their disciples also, I know that.

00:48:15.583 --> 00:48:18.750
Once I went to Ambarnath,

00:48:18.999 --> 00:48:21.458
and one gentleman came to see Me,

00:48:21.667 --> 00:48:25.458
his name was Swami Jagannath, and he said that

00:48:25.667 --> 00:48:31.917
“My guru has told me that Adi Shakti is going to come to Ambarnath,

00:48:32.083 --> 00:48:34.333
and I will try to come at that time.”

00:48:34.542 --> 00:48:39.208
I said, “Who is your guru?” So he told Me some name.

00:48:39.500 --> 00:48:44.917
He was a realized soul, no doubt. So he came down.

00:48:45.417 --> 00:48:49.625
He said, “Mother, should he come to You, or You will go to him?”

00:48:49.834 --> 00:48:52.542
I said, “See, I am a Mother. I am not a guru.”

00:48:52.792 --> 00:48:56.625
The gurus don't leave their places, can you imagine?

00:48:56.834 --> 00:48:58.959
They call it takhya.

00:48:59.125 --> 00:49:00.625
The guru should not leave his place,

00:49:00.834 --> 00:49:03.625
should sit there and everybody must come to him.

00:49:03.834 --> 00:49:07.959
I said, “I am the Mother, I will go and meet him.”

00:49:08.542 --> 00:49:11.291
So I met him

00:49:11.667 --> 00:49:15.542
and the fellow who had come, this Jagannath fellow -

00:49:15.834 --> 00:49:17.583
I said, “What's the matter with you?

00:49:17.792 --> 00:49:22.166
Why don't you open his Agnya? He's in so much pain.”

00:49:22.458 --> 00:49:26.792
He said, “Who opened my Agnya? Why should I open his Agnya?”

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:29.250
I said, “You are the guru, you are the master.”

00:49:29.458 --> 00:49:32.375
“So what? My guru never opened my Agnya.

00:49:32.583 --> 00:49:34.625
I had to fight my ego all the time

00:49:34.834 --> 00:49:38.792
and that's how I have got everything all right.”

00:49:39.750 --> 00:49:44.166
So I said, “It's so easy to open the Agnya. Why can't you open?”

00:49:44.375 --> 00:49:48.000
So I turned his Agnya and opened it, he was very happy.

00:49:48.250 --> 00:49:50.709
He said, “You are a mother, You do what You like.

00:49:50.917 --> 00:49:53.709
We are not going to do this.

00:49:53.917 --> 00:49:57.750
If you don't make them work hard for their realization,

00:49:57.959 --> 00:50:01.999
if you don't make them work hard for their development,

00:50:02.208 --> 00:50:06.375
they will never be all right. These human beings are like this.”

00:50:06.583 --> 00:50:08.709
I said, “Not for Me.”

00:50:08.917 --> 00:50:11.208
He said, “All right, You are a mother, You forgive them,

00:50:11.417 --> 00:50:16.999
You do what You like, You try to transform them, help them. But not me.”

00:50:17.250 --> 00:50:20.792
I said, “All right.” But you know, he came at My feet and all that,

00:50:20.999 --> 00:50:22.917
and he said that “You must praise.

00:50:23.083 --> 00:50:25.041
She is Adi Shakti. You must praise Her now.”

00:50:25.250 --> 00:50:29.500
He was there for a short time. Then we were coming home,

00:50:29.709 --> 00:50:32.083
then this Baba Jagannath tells Me,

00:50:32.291 --> 00:50:36.458
“Mother, thank God You have opened my Agnya.”

00:50:36.667 --> 00:50:38.208
So I said, “What happened?”

00:50:38.417 --> 00:50:42.000
“My guru when I came, he gave me two slaps on the face.

00:50:42.208 --> 00:50:45.125
I was running his ashram, supposed to be the guru.

00:50:45.333 --> 00:50:50.875
Two slaps, and put me upside down on the well.

00:50:51.083 --> 00:50:57.625
And all the time my feet were tied up to the rope

00:50:57.834 --> 00:51:01.333
which he used to lower down, again bring me up.

00:51:01.625 --> 00:51:06.041
So he put me again and again into the water seven times,

00:51:06.291 --> 00:51:10.709
then he pulled me out.” I said, “Baba, why did he do that?”

00:51:10.959 --> 00:51:16.291
He said, “I must tell You that I have been smoking sometimes.”

00:51:16.625 --> 00:51:18.583
For that.

00:51:18.792 --> 00:51:21.458
But I said, “He never gave you realization?

00:51:21.667 --> 00:51:24.333
You would be smoking in any case, that’s it.”

00:51:24.542 --> 00:51:29.041
“He wants me to give up all these bad habits with my Agnya on.

00:51:29.250 --> 00:51:31.417
Now You have opened my Agnya, I'm all right.”

00:51:31.625 --> 00:51:37.999
So I felt that the behaviour of that guru was very surprising.

00:51:38.208 --> 00:51:40.667
He says, “He beats us.

00:51:40.875 --> 00:51:44.917
He always beats us for anything and we have to work very hard.”

00:51:45.083 --> 00:51:50.500
I also know of the, some gurus of the music also do that,

00:51:50.709 --> 00:51:56.709
and I met so many of such people who have been to very great gurus

00:51:56.959 --> 00:52:01.875
and the way I got the report was so shocking to Me,

00:52:02.041 --> 00:52:04.583
that why don't they tell them directly that

00:52:04.792 --> 00:52:09.000
“See, this is wrong with you, and this is how you should be”?

00:52:09.500 --> 00:52:12.542
But the gurus say that if you tell them like that,

00:52:12.750 --> 00:52:14.959
they'll never listen.

00:52:15.125 --> 00:52:18.166
“They only know the beating.”

00:52:18.375 --> 00:52:21.917
I said, “Ba! What do you say?

00:52:22.083 --> 00:52:24.750
They only know beatings?” “Yes.”

00:52:24.959 --> 00:52:28.291
So the whole attitude towards the disciple

00:52:28.500 --> 00:52:32.041
is not of compassion, in fact.

00:52:32.583 --> 00:52:34.208
There are of course other gurus also

00:52:34.417 --> 00:52:40.917
who take a terrible test of their disciples.

00:52:41.291 --> 00:52:43.750
Like as you see, Shri Ramdasa.

00:52:43.959 --> 00:52:48.250
This was nothing compared to what Raja Janaka did.

00:52:48.542 --> 00:52:53.333
They will test the person and then only give realization,

00:52:53.542 --> 00:52:57.458
and out of thousands, to one only.

00:53:00.834 --> 00:53:02.875
That is how we've got so many false gurus also,

00:53:03.041 --> 00:53:08.875
because they were all discarded by these realized souls, so.

00:53:09.875 --> 00:53:12.250
At this point

00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:18.959
we have people who have got realization,

00:53:20.750 --> 00:53:25.041
when the real gurus are like this.

00:53:26.834 --> 00:53:29.917
I met another one, he asked Me,

00:53:30.083 --> 00:53:33.917
“Why are You giving realization to all these useless people?”

00:53:34.166 --> 00:53:36.583
I said, “Why?” And there were some Sahaja yogis,

00:53:36.792 --> 00:53:40.834
he said, “How many can give life for Shri Mataji?”

00:53:41.166 --> 00:53:45.250
I said, “Why do you want to ask for their life? I don't want their life.”

00:53:45.583 --> 00:53:49.125
He said, “This is the first question," he said,

00:53:49.750 --> 00:53:51.917
"those - I have many who will give life for me.”

00:53:52.083 --> 00:53:55.625
And he has not given them realization.

00:53:56.500 --> 00:54:01.999
So now at this juncture, when we have people who are seeking,

00:54:02.166 --> 00:54:03.583
who are going to these gurus –

00:54:03.792 --> 00:54:06.917
of course false gurus you forget, but even real gurus –

00:54:07.083 --> 00:54:09.834
they do not get their realization.

00:54:10.083 --> 00:54:15.333
Now, you are capable of giving them realization – just imagine.

00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:18.792
They have big, big ashrams and things like that,

00:54:18.999 --> 00:54:22.250
they cannot give realization.

00:54:22.458 --> 00:54:26.333
While you can, all of you can give.

00:54:28.333 --> 00:54:31.458
Now, it's like this,

00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:38.999
that if you put little light in a lamp

00:54:42.375 --> 00:54:49.834
and it is just giving light to itself, nothing else, supposing.

00:54:51.542 --> 00:54:55.709
Now you have to give light to others.

00:54:55.917 --> 00:55:00.667
You have powers, you can do it.

00:55:01.041 --> 00:55:06.750
You can really change people, you can cure them –

00:55:09.041 --> 00:55:11.333
but, you will not.

00:55:11.542 --> 00:55:17.083
You will bring all these sick people to Me, “Mother, You cure.”

00:55:18.667 --> 00:55:23.750
Even for realization I've seen they bring people to Me.

00:55:24.083 --> 00:55:25.667
What is the need?

00:55:25.875 --> 00:55:31.083
You all know how to give realization, how to cure a person.

00:55:31.542 --> 00:55:34.834
All of you know.

00:55:35.333 --> 00:55:40.583
Now why is it that you people cannot do it?

00:55:40.959 --> 00:55:44.041
Firstly, you may not be matured enough.

00:55:44.333 --> 00:55:47.417
But even if you are mature,

00:55:47.709 --> 00:55:50.375
you are not assuming your own powers,

00:55:50.625 --> 00:55:53.709
you don't believe in it.

00:55:55.959 --> 00:56:01.709
Humility is all right, but you must know what power it is.

00:56:01.917 --> 00:56:04.875
Supposing somebody is a king, say,

00:56:05.083 --> 00:56:08.917
and you put him on the throne.

00:56:09.417 --> 00:56:13.792
Now if people are coming and instead of they touching his feet,

00:56:13.999 --> 00:56:16.709
he goes and touches each and everybody's feet –

00:56:16.917 --> 00:56:21.667
this is no humility. This is nonsense.

00:56:21.875 --> 00:56:25.208
Whatever position you have,

00:56:25.417 --> 00:56:32.166
you should try to do with humility, means through compassion.

00:56:36.834 --> 00:56:41.834
The maturity is this, that you should know that you have these powers,

00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:44.750
you should know how to preserve these powers,

00:56:44.999 --> 00:56:47.834
you should know how to grow in peace,

00:56:48.041 --> 00:56:55.542
and then when you meet people you should assume, inside.

00:56:59.375 --> 00:57:04.500
I may be a housewife cooking for My grandchildren,

00:57:04.709 --> 00:57:07.750
doing this, doing that.

00:57:08.625 --> 00:57:14.542
But once I am sitting on the chair, I know what I am.

00:57:16.458 --> 00:57:20.083
You may be anything - you may be a clerk, you may be dishwasher,

00:57:20.291 --> 00:57:23.417
you may be anything, that makes no difference.

00:57:23.792 --> 00:57:29.500
But once you are a Sahaja yogi, you are a Sahaja yogi.

00:57:29.709 --> 00:57:33.291
Then you must show your dignity

00:57:34.458 --> 00:57:38.792
and not thrive on your weaknesses.

00:57:39.583 --> 00:57:42.250
You are much better than all these realized souls

00:57:42.458 --> 00:57:46.000
who have achieved their realization in thousands of years,

00:57:46.250 --> 00:57:49.291
because you have so many powers.

00:57:49.583 --> 00:57:56.166
But their self-confidence

00:57:56.542 --> 00:58:01.417
and assumption is not with you.

00:58:03.875 --> 00:58:07.750
Some people say, “We are afraid of ego.” How can you have ego?

00:58:07.959 --> 00:58:10.999
It's finished.

00:58:14.750 --> 00:58:18.250
Even if you do some mistakes, doesn't matter.

00:58:19.291 --> 00:58:21.917
“Mother, I touched my left foot, I touched my right” –

00:58:22.083 --> 00:58:25.709
makes no difference.

00:58:27.417 --> 00:58:34.291
Because of no self-confidence you become austere in Sahaja Yoga.

00:58:35.625 --> 00:58:39.208
If you are self-confident,

00:58:39.583 --> 00:58:43.375
then why should you be austere?

00:58:46.291 --> 00:58:49.542
It all goes together.

00:58:49.750 --> 00:58:55.000
First you must mature, with that you must have self-confidence,

00:58:55.208 --> 00:59:00.667
and without fear you should spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:59:01.250 --> 00:59:06.875
Some have fear about themselves and some have fear about others.

00:59:07.458 --> 00:59:11.959
Also it comes from your conditionings, from your upbringing.

00:59:12.166 --> 00:59:16.959
So today's Guru Puja is in a way very important,

00:59:17.208 --> 00:59:18.999
because everybody said, “Mother, You should be stern,

00:59:19.166 --> 00:59:20.959
You must tell them and You must - ”

00:59:21.208 --> 00:59:23.500
I said, “All right, I'll tell them.”

00:59:23.709 --> 00:59:27.291
But in no way to put you down, no way;

00:59:27.709 --> 00:59:30.917
but to tell you what you can achieve.

00:59:31.083 --> 00:59:33.709
To tell you how far you can go.

00:59:33.917 --> 00:59:38.375
You, so many are more than sufficient

00:59:38.583 --> 00:59:42.709
to transform at least ten globes,

00:59:42.959 --> 00:59:46.000
ten worlds, more than sufficient.

00:59:46.208 --> 00:59:50.458
But you are still involved in yourself, worried about yourself,

00:59:50.709 --> 00:59:54.750
only your children, your husband, this, that –

00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:57.125
doesn't work out.

00:59:59.875 --> 01:00:02.959
As much as you want to grow,

01:00:03.125 --> 01:00:08.208
this power can give you that power.

01:00:09.583 --> 01:00:13.083
But problem that lies with us is that

01:00:13.291 --> 01:00:16.208
we don't know ourselves,

01:00:16.417 --> 01:00:22.166
and we don't want to know ourselves.

01:00:23.417 --> 01:00:31.375
Today's Guru Puja should give you the state of guru.

01:00:35.583 --> 01:00:41.999
If you want, it can work out.

01:00:43.166 --> 01:00:52.208
The all-pervading divine Power of Love is absolutely working it out.

01:00:53.291 --> 01:00:58.959
More than you, the Divine wants this world to change,

01:00:59.208 --> 01:01:02.083
wants to transform the whole universe.

01:01:02.333 --> 01:01:05.792
Now you are the instruments,

01:01:08.959 --> 01:01:13.500
and if you try to cheat yourself,

01:01:13.875 --> 01:01:16.875
who can stop it?

01:01:20.625 --> 01:01:24.333
Just to enjoy music,

01:01:24.542 --> 01:01:29.583
or to enjoy the company, or belonging to some club,

01:01:29.875 --> 01:01:33.291
or to feel that it's a nice festival;

01:01:33.500 --> 01:01:35.500
or at the most you seek

01:01:35.750 --> 01:01:40.625
the security of your children and family and all that -

01:01:43.750 --> 01:01:46.500
it is not satisfying.

01:01:46.709 --> 01:01:49.792
It will never satisfy you.

01:01:49.999 --> 01:01:54.625
It will only satisfy you when you will become the lights

01:01:54.834 --> 01:01:58.750
to give it to others, to work for others.

01:01:59.083 --> 01:02:02.458
And you have these powers, what I'm trying to tell again and again,

01:02:02.667 --> 01:02:06.792
you have these powers by which you can introspect yourself,

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:11.875
you can witness yourself, and you can surrender.

01:02:12.875 --> 01:02:19.875
Because mentally now you are convinced about Sahaja Yoga.

01:02:22.583 --> 01:02:24.917
Emotionally you are convinced

01:02:25.083 --> 01:02:32.083
that Sahaja Yoga has given you such sense of love and compassion.

01:02:34.458 --> 01:02:40.250
Physically you are convinced that Sahaja Yoga has given you good health

01:02:40.500 --> 01:02:43.500
and confidence about your health.

01:02:44.542 --> 01:02:49.667
Now spiritually you should be convinced, spiritually,

01:02:49.959 --> 01:02:56.500
that you are really spiritual people selected by the Divine;

01:02:56.834 --> 01:03:00.375
that your last lives have been of great seeking,

01:03:00.583 --> 01:03:04.583
that's why you are born now, and you are getting all these blessings.

01:03:04.834 --> 01:03:11.583
So assume. assumption of your personality is important.

01:03:12.667 --> 01:03:18.375
You must meditate, you should go into thoughtless awareness,

01:03:18.583 --> 01:03:25.291
and all the time keep your attention alert.

01:03:26.125 --> 01:03:29.125
That is very important.

01:03:29.333 --> 01:03:33.625
When, what is the need, when something will come,

01:03:33.834 --> 01:03:39.542
how we have to react –

01:03:39.792 --> 01:03:43.792
all these things come to you when you are alert

01:03:44.041 --> 01:03:51.041
and aware of this all-pervading Power all the time, every moment.

01:03:51.834 --> 01:03:56.000
I don't worry at all, never . Everybody is surprised at Me.

01:03:56.208 --> 01:03:59.208
I don't worry.

01:04:00.333 --> 01:04:03.583
Why? My worry is taken over.

01:04:03.792 --> 01:04:07.125
People say, “You travel, travel.” I never travel.

01:04:07.375 --> 01:04:10.417
I'm sitting here or I'm sitting there, what is it?

01:04:10.625 --> 01:04:13.125
Where am I travelling?

01:04:13.333 --> 01:04:17.625
So you don't think on those lines.

01:04:18.458 --> 01:04:26.125
So thoughtless awareness is the first beautiful state

01:04:26.542 --> 01:04:30.709
you have to achieve. That will give you peace

01:04:30.917 --> 01:04:34.750
and a witness state to enjoy the drama of life,

01:04:34.959 --> 01:04:39.834
to enjoy the different varieties of people,

01:04:41.291 --> 01:04:46.083
while you will be growing within yourself.

01:04:48.750 --> 01:04:54.917
For a Sahaja yogi is important not to see the faults of others

01:04:55.083 --> 01:04:59.333
but your own faults, and correct them.

01:04:59.667 --> 01:05:03.999
I get so many letters regarding some lady

01:05:04.166 --> 01:05:06.834
or some leader or somebody like that.

01:05:07.041 --> 01:05:09.333
That “Mother, this leader is troubling me,

01:05:09.542 --> 01:05:11.667
that leader is troubling me, this, that.”

01:05:11.875 --> 01:05:14.917
I'm surprised.

01:05:16.583 --> 01:05:19.458
I will change the leader as soon as I’ll find something wrong,

01:05:19.667 --> 01:05:21.375
I've always done –

01:05:21.625 --> 01:05:25.291
who is not suitable, who is in problem, is always done.

01:05:25.500 --> 01:05:28.208
But the way you put your attention to the leader is

01:05:28.417 --> 01:05:32.208
perhaps the jealousy part.

01:05:32.458 --> 01:05:35.667
If the leader says something wrong with you, you should thank him.

01:05:35.875 --> 01:05:39.458
Who is there to tell you?

01:05:41.500 --> 01:05:44.458
I'm very proud of you, I'm very happy,

01:05:44.709 --> 01:05:48.999
that never such disciples existed for any guru.

01:05:49.208 --> 01:05:56.291
If I'm a guru, I should say, I should say now done, finished, - overjoyed.

01:05:56.500 --> 01:06:00.500
But when I see that you people don't realize what you have achieved,

01:06:00.709 --> 01:06:03.041
and you don't want to work it out,

01:06:03.250 --> 01:06:05.500
then I think of the parable of Christ

01:06:05.709 --> 01:06:09.625
that some seeds fell on the rock.

01:06:13.208 --> 01:06:17.250
All your affection, all your love,

01:06:18.333 --> 01:06:23.375
I know it is impossible to express what I feel about it.

01:06:23.667 --> 01:06:26.083
But you don't know why you got realization,

01:06:26.291 --> 01:06:30.125
why you are here, what is your speciality, what you have to get.

01:06:30.333 --> 01:06:33.166
You don't know that.

01:06:33.375 --> 01:06:36.583
And that is what you have to know.

01:06:36.792 --> 01:06:39.959
I don't say like Christ that take out one eye

01:06:40.166 --> 01:06:45.792
or take out one, cut out your hand – nothing of the kind.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:51.166
You’ll be intact, your body should be intact, nothing is to be taken out.

01:06:51.667 --> 01:06:55.917
We need this body. But,

01:06:56.417 --> 01:06:57.917
in a subtle way what He was saying,

01:06:58.083 --> 01:07:02.041
that whatever part of your body is doing wrong,

01:07:02.333 --> 01:07:06.333
you should try to negate it – in a subtle way.

01:07:06.583 --> 01:07:09.750
In the same way in Sahaja Yoga also,

01:07:09.999 --> 01:07:13.333
if there is jealousy try to find out why you are a jealous,

01:07:13.583 --> 01:07:15.583
why are you against the leader?

01:07:15.792 --> 01:07:19.917
The leader says a word to somebody, they immediately write to Me.

01:07:20.083 --> 01:07:22.959
Why is he leader, if he has not to tell anything?

01:07:23.125 --> 01:07:28.709
Today I think for the first time I have been able to tell something to you

01:07:29.083 --> 01:07:32.583
which I was hesitating always,

01:07:32.792 --> 01:07:36.917
that “Let it be, just now they are still little babies, it's all right.”

01:07:37.083 --> 01:07:41.208
But now, after this you have to grow,

01:07:42.458 --> 01:07:46.250
grow in every way.

01:07:46.667 --> 01:07:50.083
I just can't understand.

01:07:51.333 --> 01:07:56.625
Those who got realization without the power of raising the kundalini

01:07:56.875 --> 01:07:59.208
are doing such a lot of work.

01:07:59.458 --> 01:08:03.041
And while you all have this power to raise the kundalini,

01:08:03.250 --> 01:08:08.500
to cure people, and also to talk about Sahaja Yoga,

01:08:08.709 --> 01:08:11.041
you are so sensible.

01:08:11.250 --> 01:08:16.583
Still where is your attention, I don't understand.

01:08:17.166 --> 01:08:25.000
Today's lecture should not really in any way hurt you,

01:08:25.834 --> 01:08:29.083
because I don't want to hurt you at all.

01:08:29.333 --> 01:08:32.250
Whatever is the situation, I accept.

01:08:32.458 --> 01:08:34.999
But if you don't want to accept that situation,

01:08:35.166 --> 01:08:40.208
what you should do I have told you.

01:08:41.792 --> 01:08:48.709
This will definitely suddenly raise your spiritual height – definitely.

01:08:50.375 --> 01:08:52.458
No doubt about it.

01:08:52.667 --> 01:08:58.625
It's very important to see for yourself what's wrong.

01:09:01.083 --> 01:09:04.959
After all, you are all seekers of truth for ages,

01:09:05.166 --> 01:09:08.166
and now you've come, you have found the truth.

01:09:08.375 --> 01:09:13.792
So try to identify yourself with truth, that's all.

01:09:15.125 --> 01:09:17.333
And with reality.

01:09:17.542 --> 01:09:22.000
If you identify yourself with truth and with reality,

01:09:22.208 --> 01:09:26.875
your Sahasrara is absolutely open. No problem.

01:09:27.041 --> 01:09:30.834
Truth is in your Sahasrara.

01:09:31.041 --> 01:09:33.417
And when the truth comes in, you are surprised

01:09:33.667 --> 01:09:37.083
that truth is love and love is truth –

01:09:37.291 --> 01:09:40.083
pure love.

01:09:40.458 --> 01:09:43.625
It's very, very joy-giving,

01:09:43.834 --> 01:09:47.709
and all the niranandas you want to have,

01:09:47.917 --> 01:09:51.834
you can have, if you understand this simple equation

01:09:52.041 --> 01:09:57.583
that absolute truth is absolute love.

01:10:00.333 --> 01:10:04.000
I have no expectations.

01:10:04.250 --> 01:10:07.834
I must tell you I am oversatisfied.

01:10:08.083 --> 01:10:11.709
As far as I am concerned, I think I have done My job.

01:10:11.917 --> 01:10:18.792
But now this has to be taken over, you have to be responsible.

01:10:18.999 --> 01:10:23.083
You have to work it out. I was so happy, this time every place I went to,

01:10:23.333 --> 01:10:25.709
all the leaders said that “Mother,

01:10:25.917 --> 01:10:29.542
You need not travel, now we take the responsibility.

01:10:29.834 --> 01:10:31.750
We'll work it out.”

01:10:31.999 --> 01:10:37.625
But all of you must support your leaders and do something about it.

01:10:37.834 --> 01:10:42.375
Sometimes leaders are really, they can't understand

01:10:42.709 --> 01:10:47.834
why people are having their own ideas about everything.

01:10:50.291 --> 01:10:53.625
You must go all out.

01:10:53.875 --> 01:11:00.999
For example, in our country when we wanted to remove the slavery,

01:11:01.917 --> 01:11:07.750
everyone joined together to achieve it.

01:11:08.375 --> 01:11:11.999
While there are people who are trying to cut down the leaders,

01:11:12.166 --> 01:11:17.792
put them down, make fun of them, form groups.

01:11:19.959 --> 01:11:24.500
Is this the way we are going to work it out?

01:11:27.125 --> 01:11:29.583
You all should support the leader.

01:11:29.792 --> 01:11:34.834
You should all go all out to do what the leader is telling you.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.583
If something is wrong with the leader I'll talk to him,

01:11:37.792 --> 01:11:40.291
then I'll put him right, I promise you.

01:11:40.500 --> 01:11:44.166
But you don't try to find faults.

01:11:44.375 --> 01:11:49.166
As it is all the leaders ask Me before doing something.

01:11:49.375 --> 01:11:53.709
So you just try to follow the leaders, whatever the leader is saying,

01:11:53.959 --> 01:11:57.458
absolutely put all your effort.

01:11:57.667 --> 01:12:03.166
Because the complaints are that you people don't listen to them –

01:12:04.583 --> 01:12:07.583
I'm really surprised.

01:12:09.875 --> 01:12:13.792
Yesterday you saw he was playing sitar.

01:12:13.999 --> 01:12:16.834
You should have asked him, what about his guru?

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:20.542
His own father was his guru and he used to beat him,

01:12:20.792 --> 01:12:24.417
and then his grandfather also.

01:12:25.500 --> 01:12:30.125
But with such desire to learn something, to be something

01:12:30.333 --> 01:12:31.667
that they didn't mind anything,

01:12:31.875 --> 01:12:34.999
“Beat me, do what you like, put me in jail,

01:12:35.291 --> 01:12:38.041
but make me a good artist.”

01:12:38.291 --> 01:12:42.375
In the same way is Sahaja Yoga.

01:12:42.959 --> 01:12:47.291
Because there is, if you may call it a defect,

01:12:47.542 --> 01:12:51.041
Sahaja Yoga is not a military thing,

01:12:51.250 --> 01:12:58.208
it's just plain, simple, Mother's love.

01:12:59.583 --> 01:13:05.083
And of course every mother wants her child to be great,

01:13:05.291 --> 01:13:10.041
to have all her powers – she wants that, no doubt.

01:13:11.041 --> 01:13:17.125
How she does it, how she works it out

01:13:17.417 --> 01:13:19.458
is her own problem.

01:13:19.667 --> 01:13:25.875
But how you take it and how you use it is your own problem.

01:13:26.250 --> 01:13:29.333
I always bow to you people who have got realization,

01:13:29.542 --> 01:13:33.750
because I think so many saints were never there on this earth.

01:13:34.041 --> 01:13:38.166
But the saintliness has to be complete.

01:13:38.709 --> 01:13:43.000
Without that you cannot help even your family,

01:13:43.208 --> 01:13:49.458
leave alone your country, and no question of the whole world.

01:13:51.333 --> 01:13:56.166
So what is needed now is to raise your awakening,

01:13:56.542 --> 01:13:59.000
to raise your spirituality,

01:13:59.291 --> 01:14:06.000
to go into a realm of complete support and surrender

01:14:06.291 --> 01:14:13.417
to the movement of this spontaneous movement of Sahaja Yoga.

01:14:16.417 --> 01:14:19.417
May God bless you all.

01:14:25.834 --> 01:14:30.625
In short, you must worship yourself – in short.
