1
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:05,010
Shri Mataji, what is Sahaja Yoga?

2
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:07,220
Sahaja.

3
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:09,040
Sa means ‘with’

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,846
Ja means ‘born’.

5
00:00:11,926 --> 00:00:15,386
So it is born with you.’ The right’

6
00:00:15,466 --> 00:00:20,802
to become ‘united,’ which is the yoga with the Divine.

7
00:00:20,882 --> 00:00:25,302
And this Sahaja Yoga is something that everybody can have, is it?

8
00:00:25,382 --> 00:00:27,752
Is it something, everybody can practice?

9
00:00:27,832 --> 00:00:29,472
Of course.

10
00:00:29,552 --> 00:00:36,430
And how does this connection with the Divine take place?

11
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:40,588
We have within ourselves this power in the triangular bone

12
00:00:40,668 --> 00:00:44,068
which is called a ‘Sacrum’ meaning sacred,

13
00:00:44,148 --> 00:00:48,658
which when awakened sprouts like a plumule in a seed

14
00:00:48,738 --> 00:00:52,743
and rises through six subtle centres,

15
00:00:52,823 --> 00:00:56,933
opens out in the last centre

16
00:00:57,013 --> 00:01:01,093
and gets connected with the Divine,

17
00:01:01,173 --> 00:01:04,870
which is subtle energy, all around us,

18
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:07,300
which organises us,

19
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:10,440
which nourishes us, does all the living work.

20
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:13,729
Above all it loves us.

21
00:01:13,809 --> 00:01:19,209
Does this mean Shri Mataji, that people who have not

22
00:01:19,289 --> 00:01:23,833
had the ability to practice Sahaja Yoga are not connected with the Divine?

23
00:01:23,913 --> 00:01:25,903
Most of them are not.

24
00:01:25,983 --> 00:01:29,773
And if some of them are, they don’t know all about it.

25
00:01:29,853 --> 00:01:31,781
So this is what,

26
00:01:31,861 --> 00:01:37,011
an extra force that is available to human beings to develop themselves in this world?

27
00:01:37,091 --> 00:01:41,296
Of course.
This is the last breakthrough of our evolution,

28
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:44,196
where you have to get connected with the Divine.

29
00:01:44,276 --> 00:01:47,206
You have to feel it on your central nervous system

30
00:01:47,286 --> 00:01:50,359
and that’s how you get Self-realization.

31
00:01:52,329 --> 00:01:57,688
Do I perceive here that this is a way of balancing oneself?

32
00:01:57,768 --> 00:02:03,464
Of keeping in such a way of living one’s life,

33
00:02:03,554 --> 00:02:08,074
that one is not unbalanced in one’s view of what is going on around us?

34
00:02:08,154 --> 00:02:12,702
Yes. We have two sides in our system of the autonomous nervous system,

35
00:02:12,782 --> 00:02:13,952
left and right,

36
00:02:14,032 --> 00:02:17,402
which we call as left and right sympathetic nervous system.

37
00:02:17,482 --> 00:02:23,931
Left side caters for our emotions,

38
00:02:24,011 --> 00:02:26,961
for our past, our desires.

39
00:02:27,041 --> 00:02:31,434
The right side caters for our action,

40
00:02:31,514 --> 00:02:33,664
physical and mental.

41
00:02:33,744 --> 00:02:37,584
If you indulge in one too much and go too far with it,

42
00:02:37,664 --> 00:02:41,522
you develop an imbalance within yourself.

43
00:02:41,602 --> 00:02:46,906
In the centre lies the third power which we call as parasympathetic nervous system.

44
00:02:46,986 --> 00:02:50,656
This is the channel which is the central path of ascent.

45
00:02:50,736 --> 00:02:52,896
When the kundalini rises through it,

46
00:02:52,976 --> 00:02:55,568
it brings you in the balance

47
00:02:55,648 --> 00:03:00,308
because it rises in the centre of the system.

48
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:04,897
So this is the minimum that happens, that you develop your balance.

49
00:03:04,977 --> 00:03:09,906
So how does one actually achieve this balance?

50
00:03:09,986 --> 00:03:13,756
It just happens spontaneously.

51
00:03:13,836 --> 00:03:17,745
In other words, there is no physical requirement on an individual?

52
00:03:17,825 --> 00:03:20,495
Not at all. Not at all.

53
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:23,345
It’s an evolutionary step. As I told you

54
00:03:23,425 --> 00:03:28,235
in our evolution, we have developed a balance, we can stand on our two legs.

55
00:03:28,315 --> 00:03:29,881
Animals cannot.

56
00:03:29,961 --> 00:03:37,981
In the same way, you develop this special balance between your emotions and your actions

57
00:03:38,061 --> 00:03:41,121
in a very proper way.

58
00:03:41,201 --> 00:03:45,411
You speak as though this is some sort of evolutionary step.

59
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:46,501
Yes it is.

60
00:03:46,581 --> 00:03:48,631
It is the last breakthrough,

61
00:03:48,711 --> 00:03:50,971
that you have to become the Spirit now

62
00:03:51,051 --> 00:03:53,841
and this has to be achieved,

63
00:03:53,921 --> 00:03:56,792
which can be achieved only through a living process

64
00:03:56,872 --> 00:04:00,571
because we have become human beings through a living process

65
00:04:00,651 --> 00:04:04,417
and that living process has to act within us.

66
00:04:04,497 --> 00:04:09,757
This sounds as though it is rather a significant time than in the history of humanity?

67
00:04:09,838 --> 00:04:10,897
Very much.

68
00:04:10,977 --> 00:04:14,437
In the history of humanity, in the history of evolution,

69
00:04:14,517 --> 00:04:18,660
in the history of spirituality, it is the most important time

70
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:24,790
because here, where you will get whatever has been promised to you so far.

71
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:30,791
So it is no accident then that Sahaja Yoga has appeared in the world at this time?

72
00:04:30,871 --> 00:04:32,991
No, not at all, not at all.

73
00:04:33,071 --> 00:04:35,771
It is all predicted thousands of years back in India

74
00:04:35,851 --> 00:04:37,681
and later on by many Saints.

75
00:04:37,761 --> 00:04:41,041
Even William Blake has predicted it.

76
00:04:41,121 --> 00:04:48,467
Shri Mataji you went to Russia last year and I believe the reception you got was most surprising?

77
00:04:48,554 --> 00:04:50,207
Yes.

78
00:04:52,409 --> 00:04:53,920
I was myself surprised

79
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,233
because thousands of people came

80
00:04:56,313 --> 00:05:00,918
and very sensible well-educated people came

81
00:05:00,998 --> 00:05:03,518
and they all settled down. Thousands.

82
00:05:03,598 --> 00:05:08,528
I did not know how to cope with that number because there were so many,

83
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:15,197
and even the members of the supreme council, the government, they came.

84
00:05:15,277 --> 00:05:23,497
but I could only say that in the so-called free societies

85
00:05:23,577 --> 00:05:27,455
we waste too much time experimenting with our freedom

86
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:32,529
and indulge too much into politics which is a waste thing, I think,

87
00:05:32,609 --> 00:05:35,359
then the economics, all these things.

88
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:38,699
While the people there did not have any such chances.

89
00:05:38,779 --> 00:05:43,691
So they put their energies to something that was higher than that.

90
00:05:43,781 --> 00:05:46,281
They diverted and they were very knowledgeable,

91
00:05:46,361 --> 00:05:48,791
they knew a lot about seeking.

92
00:05:48,871 --> 00:05:54,039
They knew a lot about Kundalini and as if they were just waiting for me.

93
00:05:54,119 --> 00:05:56,759
It was very remarkable.

94
00:05:56,839 --> 00:06:01,940
Mr Gorbachev has said the Russians require a mental revolution.

95
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:06,139
Do you see the acceptance of Sahaja yoga as part of this revolution?

96
00:06:06,219 --> 00:06:08,969
Of course. He himself is a saint

97
00:06:09,049 --> 00:06:11,885
and what he is meaning by ‘mental’, that

98
00:06:11,965 --> 00:06:17,096
they should now understand that they have to develop that balance

99
00:06:17,176 --> 00:06:20,621
between communism and democracy.

100
00:06:20,701 --> 00:06:22,931
Our democracies are imbalanced.

101
00:06:23,011 --> 00:06:24,301
They are one-sided.

102
00:06:24,381 --> 00:06:27,401
They have no.. not the other side of collectivity

103
00:06:27,481 --> 00:06:29,798
but communism has collectivity.

104
00:06:29,878 --> 00:06:31,828
It is power-oriented.

105
00:06:31,908 --> 00:06:37,806
Our democracies are money-oriented.

106
00:06:37,886 --> 00:06:43,006
What he is meaning is the maturity of our wisdom

107
00:06:43,086 --> 00:06:47,091
So referring back to what we were talking about earlier,

108
00:06:47,302 --> 00:06:49,115
is it...?

109
00:06:55,017 --> 00:06:58,523
As we were talking about earlier, about bringing the human body into balance?

110
00:06:58,603 --> 00:07:04,467
Could we say then that Mr Gorbachev is bringing the whole eastern Bloc into balance?

111
00:07:04,547 --> 00:07:06,247
Yes.

112
00:07:06,327 --> 00:07:15,317
Yes, they had gone too much on one side and he is trying to bring them in the centre.

113
00:07:17,993 --> 00:07:23,713
You mentioned that you went to an eastern bloc conference last year

114
00:07:23,793 --> 00:07:29,630
and I believe you gave many influential people, Realisation?

115
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:35,240
Is it true that you believe that this was instrumental in helping the overthrow of oppressive communism?

116
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,350
It was a yoga, yoga seminar

117
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:41,650
and I expected all of them to be there

118
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:46,072
and surprisingly I talked to them hardly for 30 to 35 minutes

119
00:07:46,152 --> 00:07:49,522
and then I gave them realisation and all of them got it.

120
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:54,092
They were representatives from all these Eastern Bloc Countries.

121
00:07:54,172 --> 00:07:57,366
When they got it they were so surprised at it,

122
00:07:57,446 --> 00:08:00,586
then they walked out with me out of the hall

123
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:03,936
and nobody was left in the hall to listen to other people.

124
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:08,405
They gave me their addresses and they said we want ‘this only’, in our country

125
00:08:08,485 --> 00:08:13,155
and they wanted to start centres and I am told they have already started centres.

126
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:21,197
The all-pervading power requires a medium, to trigger something

127
00:08:21,277 --> 00:08:24,840
and when these people were created as Realised souls,

128
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:28,566
as they got connected with this ‘ all-pervading power’,

129
00:08:28,647 --> 00:08:30,162
I think they had triggered it.

130
00:08:30,242 --> 00:08:33,002
They had that confidence within them,

131
00:08:33,082 --> 00:08:35,352
that courage in them

132
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:38,484
because once we are realised, you become very courageous

133
00:08:38,564 --> 00:08:42,334
and you want to establish truth at any cost.

134
00:08:43,364 --> 00:08:46,944
Shri Mataji the West, shall we call it the Western Nations

135
00:08:47,024 --> 00:08:52,441
have had Sahaja Yoga available to them to investigate

136
00:08:52,521 --> 00:08:57,761
to see for themselves how it worked for 20 years

137
00:08:57,841 --> 00:08:59,891
and yet it has been very slow to grow.

138
00:08:59,971 --> 00:09:02,784
Why has it happened this way, do you think?

139
00:09:05,172 --> 00:09:09,912
Here people have so many diverse ideas about things.

140
00:09:09,992 --> 00:09:15,390
They're very self-opinionated also about things

141
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:19,340
and the so called man made religions all over

142
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:21,980
have also conditioned them too much.

143
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:25,650
They've other conditioning of different norms that they have

144
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:30,125
as far as the social life is concerned

145
00:09:30,205 --> 00:09:37,235
and the physical appearances rather on a very superficial level.

146
00:09:37,315 --> 00:09:40,429
So the people have not grown, I think so, much deeper.

147
00:09:40,509 --> 00:09:44,039
Of course, I must say there are so many seekers in the west,

148
00:09:44,119 --> 00:09:46,119
So many seekers

149
00:09:46,199 --> 00:09:55,688
and they were lost because as soon as people knew that there’s a market for them,

150
00:09:55,768 --> 00:09:57,914
the false gurus jumped out

151
00:09:57,994 --> 00:10:01,094
and they started preaching about false things

152
00:10:01,174 --> 00:10:03,017
just to earn money.

153
00:10:03,097 --> 00:10:05,214
They were all money-oriented people,

154
00:10:05,294 --> 00:10:08,518
Now there’s another psychology with the western mind

155
00:10:08,598 --> 00:10:11,158
that you must buy everything.

156
00:10:11,238 --> 00:10:14,708
If something is not for sale, then it is useless

157
00:10:14,788 --> 00:10:20,287
and this psychology has really deterred them to come to Sahaja Yoga very much

158
00:10:20,367 --> 00:10:23,458
because this is a living process and you cannot pay for it

159
00:10:23,538 --> 00:10:24,917
and they could not bear it.

160
00:10:24,997 --> 00:10:26,467
I mean, actually, I must say,

161
00:10:26,547 --> 00:10:31,871
one of the very important television gentlemen told me off

162
00:10:31,951 --> 00:10:37,591
that Anglo Saxon brain cannot accept anything which cannot be sold.

163
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:41,271
I did not know what to tell him.

164
00:10:41,351 --> 00:10:43,900
I just said,’ Who has made this brain?

165
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:47,290
This God has made. Then why is it so?’

166
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:53,470
So You have an expectation really that this thing called Sahaja Yoga will change the world?

167
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:54,830
Of course.

168
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:58,580
It changes human beings and they manifest a change outside.

169
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,210
And we create a new race.

170
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:02,190
That is what they are talking about.

171
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:05,329
If you want they talk of a new age, of a new race

172
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:08,095
but I don’t know what is their imagination about it.

173
00:11:08,176 --> 00:11:10,377
They talk about all this thing, ‘Aquarius.’

174
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:12,834
And Aquarius is the kundalini.

175
00:11:12,915 --> 00:11:17,085
She is placed in the Aquarius, and they talk about the Aquarius age.

176
00:11:17,165 --> 00:11:20,894
All kinds of things they are talking, writing, thinking about it,

177
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:24,364
but when it comes to actualisation.

178
00:11:24,444 --> 00:11:27,374
I think they think I am very too simple for them.

179
00:11:27,454 --> 00:11:29,274
Not complicated.

180
00:11:29,354 --> 00:11:31,921
And Sahaja yoga is too simple.

181
00:11:32,001 --> 00:11:34,311
It should be very complicated.

182
00:11:34,391 --> 00:11:38,661
And all their own ideas about seeking, that they must suffer,

183
00:11:38,741 --> 00:11:40,321
they must go to the Himalayas,

184
00:11:40,401 --> 00:11:42,531
they must starve themselves

185
00:11:42,631 --> 00:11:45,003
and then only they can get realisation

186
00:11:47,483 --> 00:11:53,693
Shri Mataji, is the evolution of the planet closely related to the evolution of humanity?

187
00:11:53,803 --> 00:11:57,331
Of course. It is very much related,

188
00:11:57,411 --> 00:12:01,831
and the planet, our planet is moving in a spiral way.

189
00:12:01,911 --> 00:12:05,051
All the planets are moving in a spiral way

190
00:12:05,131 --> 00:12:10,740
and they are creating all possible things for the use of human beings

191
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:13,938
so that they can save time.

192
00:12:14,018 --> 00:12:19,478
Save time for getting their ascent and for meditative growth,

193
00:12:19,558 --> 00:12:23,378
but people don’t understand that part.

194
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:26,448
There are theories around now,

195
00:12:26,528 --> 00:12:30,588
the suggestion so we say, that the planet could be a living organism,

196
00:12:30,668 --> 00:12:32,458
a complete entity?

197
00:12:32,538 --> 00:12:34,268
Of course it is.

198
00:12:34,348 --> 00:12:37,178
One of the examples of this one, I can give you,

199
00:12:37,258 --> 00:12:44,244
is that if you sleep under a coconut tree,

200
00:12:44,324 --> 00:12:47,734
a coconut never falls on anything that is living,

201
00:12:47,814 --> 00:12:50,344
whether it is a human being or a snake.

202
00:12:50,424 --> 00:12:51,764
Never falls.

203
00:12:54,514 --> 00:13:00,459
That is so? Is it all around the world, coconuts never fall on living creatures?

204
00:13:00,539 --> 00:13:02,969
So they understand.

205
00:13:03,049 --> 00:13:10,497
We call it as Shri Pala because we think that it is like a brain which understands.

206
00:13:11,377 --> 00:13:14,572
Well, if this world is a living organism,

207
00:13:14,652 --> 00:13:16,891
what is the brain? What drives this being,

208
00:13:16,971 --> 00:13:21,562
this organism? What has made it evolve the way it has?

209
00:13:21,642 --> 00:13:27,175
There is this subtle power which is all-pervading of God’s love

210
00:13:27,255 --> 00:13:32,645
which manifests all the things like living work,

211
00:13:32,725 --> 00:13:36,095
all nourishment, all balancing.

212
00:13:36,175 --> 00:13:42,435
It’s so balanced if the Pacific was slightly deeper than this,

213
00:13:42,515 --> 00:13:45,039
there would have been problems.

214
00:13:46,285 --> 00:13:54,098
If Himalaya was say one and a half times than what it is,

215
00:13:54,178 --> 00:13:56,278
there would have been problems.

216
00:13:56,358 --> 00:13:59,438
So everything is so balanced in nature,

217
00:13:59,518 --> 00:14:03,338
and the Almighty has created only one world.

218
00:14:03,418 --> 00:14:06,274
Only we human beings have divided

219
00:14:06,354 --> 00:14:10,152
and moved like criminals with our passports in our hands.

220
00:14:11,474 --> 00:14:14,714
Shri Mataji, What we have been talking about,

221
00:14:14,794 --> 00:14:18,943
many people would regard as a belief or a theory.

222
00:14:19,023 --> 00:14:24,173
How does one know the difference between truth and a belief?

223
00:14:24,253 --> 00:14:28,695
First of all anything for which you have to pay money is not the truth.

224
00:14:28,775 --> 00:14:30,155
You can’t pay for the truth.

225
00:14:30,235 --> 00:14:38,255
If you cancel out that, I think 99.9% of all the falsehood will drop out.

226
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:42,114
But truth to be really actualised

227
00:14:42,194 --> 00:14:45,764
you have to have Self Realisation.

228
00:14:45,844 --> 00:14:49,764
Then you feel on your fingertips vibratory awareness.

229
00:14:49,844 --> 00:14:52,684
A new awareness, a new dimension awareness..

230
00:14:52,764 --> 00:14:56,794
by which you can make out what is true and what is false.

231
00:14:56,874 --> 00:15:01,264
That's an absolute truth that you realise at that stage.

232
00:15:02,974 --> 00:15:06,761
So one must have one’s realisation really to be able, to tell the truth?

233
00:15:06,841 --> 00:15:11,128
Even to follow anyone, one must have Realisation.

234
00:15:11,951 --> 00:15:13,606
Shri Mataji thank you very much.

235
00:15:13,687 --> 00:15:15,066
Thank you.

236
00:15:17,929 --> 00:15:21,022
Russians are doing wonderfully too.

237
00:15:21,131 --> 00:15:23,228
Russians are doing wonderfully.

238
00:15:23,762 --> 00:15:26,096
Shri Mother, I was reading an article just now

239
00:15:26,176 --> 00:15:29,546
where you were talking about inner peace and outer peace?

240
00:15:29,626 --> 00:15:36,476
This seems to be something that attracts the attention of people in a stressful age.

241
00:15:38,093 --> 00:15:39,860
By realisation

242
00:15:42,053 --> 00:15:44,409
what happens, as a result

243
00:15:44,489 --> 00:15:47,244
you become a person

244
00:15:47,324 --> 00:15:50,802
endowed with thoughtless awareness.

245
00:15:50,882 --> 00:15:54,294
That means you see everything.

246
00:15:54,374 --> 00:15:56,624
You witness everything

247
00:15:56,704 --> 00:15:59,128
and whenever you want to

248
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:03,485
say or to think you can see about it

249
00:16:03,565 --> 00:16:08,218
but you don’t react. There is no reaction.

250
00:16:08,298 --> 00:16:10,111
So you are

251
00:16:13,441 --> 00:16:21,684
empowered to see it in such a manner

252
00:16:21,764 --> 00:16:25,664
that there need not be any thought,

253
00:16:25,744 --> 00:16:30,064
just the whole creation acts on you.

254
00:16:30,154 --> 00:16:32,644
It’s a very subtle thing.

255
00:16:32,739 --> 00:16:34,634
It is to be experienced

256
00:16:34,714 --> 00:16:41,244
and that is the point where we realize that we are the source of peace,

257
00:16:41,324 --> 00:16:44,882
and that is how our inner peace is established.

258
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:47,152
Now people have many foundations of peace,

259
00:16:47,232 --> 00:16:50,682
I have known all of them. They have no peace within themselves.

260
00:16:50,762 --> 00:16:53,558
Some people have got peace awards

261
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:56,618
and they're horribly hot-tempered people,

262
00:16:56,698 --> 00:17:00,088
but they have got peace awards, Noble prizes.

263
00:17:01,178 --> 00:17:06,943
The peace has to be first of all found inside and then it manifests outside.

264
00:17:09,503 --> 00:17:13,180
Shri Mataji, another question we wanted to ask you

265
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:18,160
is because of this rather useful way,

266
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:23,890
You use your hands to describe the movements of the chakras when they part

267
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:26,515
I wonder if you could just explain why,

268
00:17:26,595 --> 00:17:32,099
when illness occurs it occurs because of the movement away of one centre from another?

269
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,325
All right.

270
00:17:33,406 --> 00:17:37,543
What I try to show them is that this is the left side, this is the right side.

271
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:40,103
This is the left sympathetic nervous system say

272
00:17:40,183 --> 00:17:42,733
and this is the right sympathetic nervous system

273
00:17:42,813 --> 00:17:45,823
and really the spinal cord looks like this,

274
00:17:45,903 --> 00:17:48,253
and inside here is the spinal cord

275
00:17:49,381 --> 00:17:50,661
which has the centres in it.

276
00:17:50,741 --> 00:17:51,791
The subtle centres.

277
00:17:53,391 --> 00:17:56,901
Now when you start using the energy of these centres,

278
00:17:56,981 --> 00:17:59,801
say too much on the right

279
00:17:59,881 --> 00:18:03,401
and it starts moving more towards the right

280
00:18:03,481 --> 00:18:05,501
and there is a constriction

281
00:18:05,581 --> 00:18:09,403
and the power becomes less because you are exhausted,

282
00:18:09,483 --> 00:18:11,403
going more towards the right side.

283
00:18:11,483 --> 00:18:15,693
Suddenly something happens and from the left, if there is a jerk,

284
00:18:15,773 --> 00:18:19,325
then the connection is completely broken.

285
00:18:19,405 --> 00:18:22,971
This is on its own. It starts working on its own.

286
00:18:23,051 --> 00:18:27,121
That is what you say that this has become malignant.

287
00:18:27,201 --> 00:18:31,909
It has no relationship with the whole to have proportionate growth

288
00:18:31,989 --> 00:18:35,749
So if the nose starts developing it can cover your eyes

289
00:18:35,829 --> 00:18:37,859
and cover your mouth. Everything!

290
00:18:37,939 --> 00:18:41,329
This is how a cancer is set in or any other disease.

291
00:18:41,409 --> 00:18:43,644
So many psychosomatic diseases

292
00:18:43,724 --> 00:18:47,884
are nothing but somatic is from the right side

293
00:18:47,994 --> 00:18:49,804
and when the psyche gives in,

294
00:18:49,884 --> 00:18:52,484
then it becomes a psychosomatic disease.

295
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:56,474
There are so many diseases which are more psychosomatic

296
00:18:56,554 --> 00:19:01,364
than physical and these we call them as incurable,

297
00:19:01,444 --> 00:19:05,324
can be easily cured by kundalini awakening

298
00:19:05,404 --> 00:19:07,985
because when kundalini passes through this,

299
00:19:08,101 --> 00:19:09,609
she just integrates them.

300
00:19:09,689 --> 00:19:11,859
For example, she’s going like this

301
00:19:11,939 --> 00:19:15,999
then she goes into this integrates them.

302
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:20,024
Just like she strings them like pearls

303
00:19:20,104 --> 00:19:25,154
and so they have brought around and also she nourishes that centre.

304
00:19:25,234 --> 00:19:27,465
That's how people get cured,

305
00:19:27,545 --> 00:19:30,710
automatically by themselves, by their own power.
