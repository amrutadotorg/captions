Shri Adi Shakti Puja
Cabella Ligure (Italy), 25 May 1997

00:00:08.337 --> 00:00:18.062
Today we are going to do the puja
of Adi Shakti.

00:00:24.447 --> 00:00:31.239
It’s a difficult subject to talk about
Adi Shakti

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:42.393
because it’s not easy to understand

00:00:43.026 --> 00:00:48.887
that Adi Shakti is the power of Sadashiva.

00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:55.135
Sadashiva is the God Almighty.

00:00:56.158 --> 00:01:00.310
She is His breath, as they some people
call it.

00:01:00.511 --> 00:01:04.910
Some say She is the desire

00:01:06.783 --> 00:01:16.709
and some say that She’s the entire power
of Sadashiva,

00:01:17.016 --> 00:01:26.656
and Sadashiva cannot do anything without
Her powers.

00:01:30.448 --> 00:01:39.261
This subject has been described by many
people in various books in different ways.

00:01:40.066 --> 00:01:46.341
But actually we need not go

00:01:46.542 --> 00:01:50.800
to the background of the creation
of Adi Shakti,

00:01:51.001 --> 00:01:57.830
for that at least you’ll need seven
lectures. But we’ll come to the point

00:01:58.031 --> 00:02:03.623
where Adi Shakti started working on this
Mother Earth.

00:02:05.237 --> 00:02:07.835
The first thing is we must know,

00:02:08.036 --> 00:02:13.783
that She created a Kundalini in the Mother
Earth itself

00:02:14.818 --> 00:02:23.719
and She created Shri Ganesha out of
the Mother Earth, it’s very interesting.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.443
So the Mother Earth becomes a very
important thing for us.

00:02:29.644 --> 00:02:34.004
If we do not know how to respect the Mother
Earth,

00:02:34.475 --> 00:02:40.190
we do not know how to respect ourselves.

00:02:40.571 --> 00:02:45.887
The expression of Adi Shakti within you
is the Kundalini, no doubt.

00:02:46.088 --> 00:02:50.946
That is the reflection of Adi Shakti
in you.

00:02:51.147 --> 00:02:57.318
But the reflection in the Mother Earth is
also expressed,

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:06.733
as you all know, in different places,
different countries, different cities,

00:03:06.934 --> 00:03:15.954
as the manifestation of chakras and
Adi Shakti’s creations.

00:03:16.155 --> 00:03:24.884
It was very important first to create
a very holy Mother Earth

00:03:25.085 --> 00:03:29.237
for human beings to be born on that.

00:03:30.118 --> 00:03:41.032
So the reflection of the Adi Shakti as
Kundalini first was on the Mother Earth.

00:03:41.233 --> 00:03:49.618
Kundalini is a, we should say, is a wee
part of the Adi Shakti,

00:03:50.264 --> 00:03:58.957
or we can say that She is the desire,
pure desire of the Adi Shakti.

00:03:59.158 --> 00:04:05.276
So Adi Shakti is the desire, complete
desire of Sadashiva

00:04:05.477 --> 00:04:18.548
and Kundalini, Adi Kundalini, is the desire,
complete desire of Adi Shakti.

00:04:18.929 --> 00:04:23.208
Now this one was first expressed

00:04:24.782 --> 00:04:30.326
in the Mother Earth, inside the Mother
Earth.

00:04:31.762 --> 00:04:37.500
Inside the Mother Earth, the Kundalini
came up

00:04:38.424 --> 00:04:45.374
in such a way that it cooled down the inner
part of the Mother Earth

00:04:45.596 --> 00:04:48.999
as much as it could,

00:04:50.085 --> 00:05:02.335
and then it manifested on the surface
of the earth as different chakras.

00:05:04.045 --> 00:05:12.080
So it’s tremendous similarity that we have

00:05:13.326 --> 00:05:20.350
with Virata, the Mother Earth and the human
beings.

00:05:22.201 --> 00:05:34.073
If all of them are being reflected by
the Adi Kundalini,

00:05:34.274 --> 00:05:40.257
so there has to be a great connection
between them.

00:05:41.123 --> 00:05:50.865
It is not understood by human beings how
they are connected to this Mother Earth.

00:05:51.066 --> 00:05:56.330
This Kundalini passed through different
centers, creating different centers

00:05:56.531 --> 00:06:04.019
in the Mother Earth and ultimately broke
through Kailasha.

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:07.878
And I don’t know how many have you been
to Kailash you’ll see

00:06:08.079 --> 00:06:14.075
tremendous vibrations flowing out
of Kailash.

00:06:14.898 --> 00:06:20.030
Now the way we insult our Mother Earth,

00:06:20.324 --> 00:06:27.999
what we are doing is we are insulting
the Adi Shakti.

00:06:28.317 --> 00:06:34.327
So many ways there are we should respect
the Mother Earth.

00:06:34.528 --> 00:06:42.478
I mean it was an Indian custom to begin
with, when you got up from your bed

00:06:42.679 --> 00:06:46.559
and you touched the Mother Earth with
your feet,

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:51.584
you have to say, “Oh Mother Earth, please
forgive me

00:06:51.785 --> 00:06:56.290
because I’m touching you with my feet”.

00:06:58.425 --> 00:07:07.436
All the movements of Mother Earth are
controlled by this inner Kundalini,

00:07:07.637 --> 00:07:11.477
which is the reflection of Adi Shakti.

00:07:11.678 --> 00:07:17.555
The gravity that it has also is
the manifestation

00:07:17.756 --> 00:07:23.486
of the Kundalini of the Mother Earth.

00:07:23.687 --> 00:07:33.070
Now, why we are suffering in this beautiful
planet,

00:07:33.271 --> 00:07:39.719
because we do not respect what we have
to respect the most.

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:45.110
Mother Earth is to be respected, meaning
what?

00:07:45.311 --> 00:07:54.326
Meaning that whatever is created on this
earth, by the movement of the earth,

00:07:54.527 --> 00:08:01.685
by the sea, by all the elements, has to be
respected.

00:08:02.054 --> 00:08:10.608
Today’s problem is pollution, all kinds
of things people talk of.

00:08:10.809 --> 00:08:15.763
The reason behind it, people never
understood the importance

00:08:15.964 --> 00:08:23.656
of all these five elements which are
supportive of our life.

00:08:23.857 --> 00:08:28.699
So to respect the Mother Earth people do
Bhumi Puja.

00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:32.226
Many people, when they are building
a house,

00:08:32.427 --> 00:08:37.222
they will do the Bhumi Pujan, means they
will respect the Mother Earth,

00:08:37.423 --> 00:08:43.449
because if She is not being respected maybe
there could be an earthquake,

00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:53.766
which means that this Mother Earth
understands, knows and acts.

00:08:55.290 --> 00:09:02.684
It acts in such a manner that human beings
don’t understand why such things happen.

00:09:02.885 --> 00:09:09.367
Now, we can say that, in a place called
Latur,

00:09:09.891 --> 00:09:20.539
it was Shri Ganesha’s fourteenth day and
they had to submerge

00:09:21.284 --> 00:09:30.584
the statues into the sea or into the river,
so they went all out, singing, dancing.

00:09:30.785 --> 00:09:35.923
After coming from there they all started
drinking,

00:09:36.282 --> 00:09:43.525
and drinking is not liked by Mother Earth
at all.

00:09:43.726 --> 00:09:49.382
If you are drunk and you are walking
on the road you’ll fall down.

00:09:49.953 --> 00:09:59.895
It so happened with their drinking that
a big earthquake broke in,

00:10:00.096 --> 00:10:04.965
and all those who were dancing, were
drinking, all of them

00:10:05.166 --> 00:10:10.432
were engulfed into that earthquake by
Mother Earth.

00:10:10.633 --> 00:10:18.427
Only our center, which is there, was
surrounded by a big gap

00:10:18.628 --> 00:10:27.787
but nothing happened to our center and not
one single Sahaja Yogi was ruined by that.

00:10:27.988 --> 00:10:33.883
We can understand because we are Sahaja
Yogis, how the Mother Earth has acted

00:10:34.084 --> 00:10:38.660
to save those people, who were Sahaja
Yogis.

00:10:38.861 --> 00:10:45.766
So the understanding of Mother Earth about
saints is very great.

00:10:45.967 --> 00:10:54.493
She knows who is a saint, She knows
the feet of a saint

00:10:54.694 --> 00:11:00.847
and that’s why, you know so many things
were created, like Moses,

00:11:01.048 --> 00:11:07.091
He went to the sea and the Mother Earth
came up, for them to walk through.

00:11:07.292 --> 00:11:14.659
If all the Jews had walked, it would not
have worked, but it was Moses

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:21.653
and His saintliness that the Mother Earth
Herself came up and helped.

00:11:21.854 --> 00:11:32.373
In the same way when Rama was building
a big bridge between Lanka and India,

00:11:32.574 --> 00:11:36.748
the Mother Earth came up as a bridge.

00:11:37.041 --> 00:11:44.671
So we should not try to curse the Mother
Earth for any mishaps on this Earth.

00:11:44.885 --> 00:11:50.708
If people are saintly they will be always
protected by Mother Earth.

00:11:50.909 --> 00:11:56.606
She will always try to give them whatever
they want.

00:11:56.807 --> 00:12:03.444
You can see in the minute way, that
supposing now, in our Cabella here,

00:12:03.645 --> 00:12:09.193
the roses are of such a big size, such
a big size roses,

00:12:09.402 --> 00:12:15.928
you won’t find such big size in the whole
world. But we have here, such big ones.

00:12:16.129 --> 00:12:21.004
In Pratisthan we had

00:12:22.405 --> 00:12:28.327
flowers of sunflower so big as that.
One man could not lift it.

00:12:28.528 --> 00:12:33.874
Now, how is it all this is happening
in particular places?

00:12:34.075 --> 00:12:39.319
Is the Mother Earth who knows who is living
here,

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:48.712
who is walking on Her back we should say,
or on Her soil,

00:12:48.913 --> 00:12:53.703
because Mother Earth understands
vibrations.

00:12:53.904 --> 00:13:01.262
Now, certain places we say that are very
holy.

00:13:07.718 --> 00:13:14.734
How have they discovered that these places
are holy, because of magnetic forces.

00:13:14.935 --> 00:13:19.941
The magnetic forces in England I was
surprised, were crossing each other

00:13:20.142 --> 00:13:23.072
at a place called Oxted where we lived.

00:13:23.273 --> 00:13:27.866
They were crossing since long, but we lived
there later on.

00:13:28.067 --> 00:13:37.253
So Mother Earth also organizes and arranges
things for saintly people.

00:13:37.454 --> 00:13:44.063
It's very interesting to see how the Mother
Earth guides you in a proper way.

00:13:44.264 --> 00:13:47.214
I mean, I don't know how many instances
I can give you.

00:13:47.415 --> 00:13:52.940
But we don’t understand the value of
the understanding of this Mother Earth

00:13:53.141 --> 00:13:59.214
and Her loving protection for all
he saints.

00:13:59.435 --> 00:14:06.262
In the same way, we have to understand how
the whole atmosphere, the rain,

00:14:06.463 --> 00:14:10.504
comes in at the right time, the moon,
the sun,

00:14:10.705 --> 00:14:17.578
everything works out in such a beautiful
manner because they know it’s a saint.

00:14:17.779 --> 00:14:24.902
They know these are saintly people sitting
here. They know that they are pure people,

00:14:25.103 --> 00:14:31.711
that they are the essence of life and they
should be looked after,

00:14:31.912 --> 00:14:36.160
they should be cared for, they should be
bothered for.

00:14:36.361 --> 00:14:42.604
It is not bothered about people who are
of no use.

00:14:42.805 --> 00:14:49.302
For example now for Haj, so many people
went and so many were killed.

00:14:49.503 --> 00:14:54.360
Some went to Amarnath and they were killed
because they were not saints,

00:14:54.561 --> 00:15:00.138
just ritualistic people, going for a ritual
which,

00:15:00.339 --> 00:15:09.520
in the discretion of the Mother Earth, was
of no avail and of no advantage to them.

00:15:09.721 --> 00:15:13.059
But nobody learns from this, nobody learns.

00:15:13.179 --> 00:15:17.246
When so many people were going to say,
Amarnath were killed,

00:15:17.447 --> 00:15:21.787
Pakistan said, “See, they should not have
gone to this Amarnath,

00:15:21.988 --> 00:15:28.056
it’s a false place, why did they go there?
And by going there

00:15:28.257 --> 00:15:32.701
what has proved is that it’s not a holy
place”.

00:15:32.902 --> 00:15:36.647
But when the Haj thing took place, they had
nothing to say,

00:15:36.848 --> 00:15:39.898
they didn’t know how to explain this
Haj business

00:15:40.099 --> 00:15:44.872
and the killing – dying of so many people.

00:15:45.073 --> 00:15:52.597
The reason is this, that these people have
been going to Haj all the time.

00:15:52.798 --> 00:15:56.620
Once there was a stampede with thirty-two
thousand people being

00:15:56.821 --> 00:16:01.278
injured and troubled and killed. Now this
is it.

00:16:01.479 --> 00:16:09.589
Now, what is Mother Earth suggesting, that
going to these places,

00:16:09.795 --> 00:16:16.465
holy places, they are really holy, no doubt;
going to these places,

00:16:16.666 --> 00:16:20.831
you are not doing any spiritual ascent.

00:16:21.032 --> 00:16:28.258
You are not achieving anything by going
to these places, which are really holy.

00:16:28.459 --> 00:16:32.317
That cannot be challenged. They are holy
places.

00:16:32.518 --> 00:16:37.370
You must be knowing that I was born
in Chindwara, and Mecca and Chindwara

00:16:37.571 --> 00:16:43.012
are on the same Cancer line. How is it?

00:16:43.213 --> 00:16:50.182
What is about Mecca? Mecca is
Makkeshwarashiv – it’s a Shiva.

00:16:50.383 --> 00:16:56.963
Why did Mohammed Sahib ask people
to worship a stone?

00:16:57.164 --> 00:17:01.912
He didn’t believe in stones, He was against
all kinds of idol worship;

00:17:02.113 --> 00:17:06.925
then why did He say this black stone,
which is there, has to be worshipped,

00:17:07.126 --> 00:17:10.742
for that people have to go there. What was
the reason?

00:17:10.943 --> 00:17:16.084
Because He could feel the vibrations, He
could feel that it’s a swayambhu,

00:17:16.285 --> 00:17:20.137
so He said it. So all the Muslims like mad
are going there.

00:17:20.338 --> 00:17:26.780
By going there nobody has improved, I have
not seen anybody improved by going to Mecca.

00:17:26.981 --> 00:17:31.156
It's just a kind of a ritual. They think
if they go there,

00:17:31.357 --> 00:17:35.346
when they will die tomorrow they will tell
God, “See now, we have a certificate,

00:17:35.547 --> 00:17:38.476
we have been to Mecca.”

00:17:40.479 --> 00:17:46.309
Like our pope once upon a time used to give
certificate, that when you go to heaven,

00:17:46.510 --> 00:17:52.543
you can show the certificate that now you
are a real Christian.

00:17:52.744 --> 00:17:59.696
In this way, all these artificial things
came up, but there is reality behind it.

00:17:59.897 --> 00:18:06.268
The difference is the reality is for
the real people and not for false people.

00:18:06.469 --> 00:18:09.604
But this ritualism has grown too much.

00:18:09.805 --> 00:18:16.815
Like in India we have many swayambhus
created by the Kundalini again I would say,

00:18:17.016 --> 00:18:20.213
and which are really worshipped.

00:18:20.414 --> 00:18:27.134
I’ve been to most of them and I was
surprised that most of the pujaris

00:18:27.335 --> 00:18:32.404
were suffering from some sort of a serious
disease. Like one was a paralyzed fellow.

00:18:32.605 --> 00:18:36.829
He said, “We are serving this God here,
and You said this is swayambhu;

00:18:37.030 --> 00:18:40.553
then Mother, how, why is it we are
suffering from this disease?”

00:18:40.754 --> 00:18:45.549
I said, “Because you are just making money.
You can’t make money out of God.

00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:50.141
If you don’t want to serve God, you don’t
stay here, but if you want to serve God,

00:18:50.342 --> 00:18:55.330
then you can stay here, but don’t make
money out of this”.

00:18:55.531 --> 00:19:02.610
It’s very common, I have seen, those people
who make money get paralysis, I’ve seen it.

00:19:04.675 --> 00:19:12.370
It’s a very deep understanding all these
elements, Mother Earth,

00:19:12.571 --> 00:19:17.322
everybody has about everything.

00:19:18.393 --> 00:19:23.529
Because their Kundalini is not like your
Kundalini,

00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:33.887
which is, though in itself is pure, but
because of your human endeavors,

00:19:34.088 --> 00:19:39.536
human mistakes, ego, superego, all sorts
of nonsense,

00:19:39.737 --> 00:19:48.218
the Kundalini is not so sensitive, nor does
it tell you what is happening.

00:19:48.419 --> 00:19:57.665
It has to be very alert, sensitive
spirituality within you,

00:19:57.866 --> 00:20:04.919
by which you can say immediately what you
think,

00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:09.903
what you know, what you understand about
anything.

00:20:10.104 --> 00:20:15.757
But the problem is that this doesn’t exist.

00:20:16.044 --> 00:20:20.990
Why is it you should not be so sensitive?

00:20:21.199 --> 00:20:25.663
On the contrary, I have seen, if their
mind works against somebody,

00:20:25.864 --> 00:20:28.501
then they start saying, “You are catching
on this, you are catching on that,

00:20:28.621 --> 00:20:34.120
you are catching on that”. Actually
the person who’s saying that is catching.

00:20:34.822 --> 00:20:40.300
So with this thing one has to understand
that if we are the true reflection

00:20:40.501 --> 00:20:51.812
of Adi Shakti, then we should be pure,
absolutely pure, like the white snow.

00:20:52.013 --> 00:20:57.007
Even one black drop – that’s why I wore
today the white sari -

00:20:57.208 --> 00:21:01.026
falls on the white, it shows.

00:21:01.289 --> 00:21:11.740
You should be so white that anything,
any minute black spot

00:21:11.941 --> 00:21:21.590
also should be seen by you, and in others
also to be felt by you.

00:21:22.217 --> 00:21:36.698
If that height is achieved by pure life,
by pure thinking, by pure heart,

00:21:36.899 --> 00:21:42.814
it is not necessary to manipulate anything;
no, no need at all.

00:21:43.015 --> 00:21:50.104
It’s all natural like the Mother Earth is.
Does She manipulate anything? Nothing.

00:21:50.305 --> 00:21:55.322
Just see how spontaneous She is. You put
a seed in the Mother Earth

00:21:55.523 --> 00:21:59.434
and see how it sprouts.

00:21:59.635 --> 00:22:05.458
She is so spontaneous, Her activity is so
spontaneous, we never wonder about it.

00:22:05.659 --> 00:22:09.702
See different types of flowers, different
types of fragrance,

00:22:09.903 --> 00:22:14.045
different types of shrubs and trees,

00:22:14.246 --> 00:22:19.532
how She grows with such balance in every
place.

00:22:19.733 --> 00:22:29.066
In every minute atom and molecule of that
Mother Earth there is sense.

00:22:31.046 --> 00:22:38.876
So before us is the best reflection of the
Adi Shakti and that is this Mother Earth.

00:22:39.077 --> 00:22:42.257
So first we must respect the Mother Earth.

00:22:42.458 --> 00:22:46.102
I like you people because you are sitting
on the ground, it’s very good.

00:22:46.303 --> 00:22:51.046
For meditation if you can sit on the Mother
Earth it will be extremely good

00:22:51.247 --> 00:22:56.291
because the special quality of the Mother
Earth, which also I have unfortunately,

00:22:56.492 --> 00:23:03.600
that I suck your problems. She too sucks
your problem

00:23:03.801 --> 00:23:09.334
and when She sucks your problem you get
rid of them without any difficulties.

00:23:09.535 --> 00:23:16.696
So, if you cannot, say, sit on the ground,
then you take a stone, better is,

00:23:16.897 --> 00:23:23.123
or you can have a marble, or something which
is natural on which you should try to sit.

00:23:23.324 --> 00:23:27.564
But if you sit on the plastic and do your
meditation, I don’t know

00:23:27.765 --> 00:23:31.446
what is going to help you – the plastic?

00:23:31.682 --> 00:23:36.210
That’s why I request you always, that use
natural things,

00:23:36.411 --> 00:23:43.597
because natural things can absorb your
problems very well.

00:23:43.890 --> 00:23:47.345
Unnaturally also we live otherwise.

00:23:47.546 --> 00:23:51.377
You see it is on the physical line, also
on mental line.

00:23:51.578 --> 00:24:00.669
On mental line what do we do, that we go on
arguing, explaining,

00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:05.810
it’s going on and on and on and on! There’s
no end to it.

00:24:06.011 --> 00:24:11.387
One should get headache, you see, actually
with all that. But if you are spontaneous,

00:24:11.588 --> 00:24:15.729
if you are very spontaneous, immediately
you will know

00:24:15.930 --> 00:24:21.364
what the other fellow is trying to do or
to say or to communicate.

00:24:21.565 --> 00:24:23.854
You don’t need much thinking about it,

00:24:24.055 --> 00:24:28.527
because you can absorb even the thought
of another person.

00:24:28.728 --> 00:24:33.573
Absorb doesn’t mean that you take the bad
thing of that person,

00:24:33.774 --> 00:24:39.933
but it’s like the sieving out. You absorb
what another person is saying

00:24:40.134 --> 00:24:43.000
and you sieve it out.

00:24:44.832 --> 00:24:51.199
Now the problem of this Adi Shakti is this,
that I decided

00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:59.088
that I will have all of you enter into
My body, absorb all of you.

00:24:59.293 --> 00:25:03.375
It’s a very dangerous game I know, but
I did play,

00:25:03.576 --> 00:25:08.232
because I’m supposed to do at this stage
of time,

00:25:08.433 --> 00:25:12.178
that I should absorb you all in My body.

00:25:12.379 --> 00:25:16.415
So with you, all your problems are also
gone into Me,

00:25:16.616 --> 00:25:19.598
all your troubles also have gone into Me.

00:25:19.799 --> 00:25:24.137
But by absorbing it, see, it’s like ocean
into which you are put

00:25:24.338 --> 00:25:33.501
and you are cleansed. But what about
the ocean?

00:25:33.898 --> 00:25:40.637
Ocean has got still your problems and things
lingering and they are very troublesome.

00:25:40.838 --> 00:25:46.317
So the best thing would be for you
to cleanse yourself.

00:25:46.563 --> 00:25:51.703
Cleansing is very important through
introspection.

00:25:51.904 --> 00:25:55.169
But doesn’t mean thinking, never means
thinking.

00:25:55.370 --> 00:26:00.844
But introspection means meditation and that
you all should meditate.

00:26:01.045 --> 00:26:05.575
I must tell you, we had a meeting
of the leaders

00:26:05.776 --> 00:26:09.438
and they came out and sat in the drawing
room.

00:26:09.639 --> 00:26:14.146
As soon as they assembled I had such
a severe pain in the stomach

00:26:14.347 --> 00:26:20.062
and I had such a bad diarrhea that you
can’t believe.

00:26:20.263 --> 00:26:24.891
Now, who has got those problems, I don’t
know.

00:26:29.411 --> 00:26:32.447
Who has brought these problems, I don’t
know.

00:26:32.648 --> 00:26:39.513
But as a Mother, as a Mother, I don’t mind
anything,

00:26:39.714 --> 00:26:43.750
as long as you all get well and purified.

00:26:43.951 --> 00:26:48.735
Just like as the Mother Earth cares for you,
I also care for you.

00:26:48.936 --> 00:26:53.096
And just like as the Mother Earth loves you,
I also love you,

00:26:53.297 --> 00:26:56.516
whether you are bad or good is not
the point.

00:26:56.717 --> 00:27:03.634
But to be kind to Me if you could try to be
really good Sahaja Yogis,

00:27:03.835 --> 00:27:09.338
not a showoffs, not business-like, not only
thinking type,

00:27:09.539 --> 00:27:13.220
not argumentative, not criticizing others;

00:27:13.421 --> 00:27:18.209
if you just try to meditate every day ten
to fifteen minutes,

00:27:18.410 --> 00:27:24.181
I tell you, My health will be first class.
Because I have taken your injections inside

00:27:24.382 --> 00:27:28.693
and they start torturing My life for nothing
at all.

00:27:28.894 --> 00:27:34.582
See so, now, it’s a risk I have run, and
I am sure you are all very sensible people,

00:27:34.783 --> 00:27:38.977
and you will understand that your Mother
shouldn’t suffer.

00:27:39.178 --> 00:27:42.318
This is every-day crucifixion for Me
sometimes you know,

00:27:42.519 --> 00:27:48.190
and I don’t know what to say. For example,
the other day in Delhi,

00:27:48.391 --> 00:27:52.089
one gentleman who is a leader, came to Me,
to see Me,

00:27:52.290 --> 00:27:56.590
and My one foot started going like that
and paining so much.

00:27:56.757 --> 00:27:59.667
I mean I didn’t know what to tell him that,
“You get out now,”

00:27:59.868 --> 00:28:02.059
because I just can’t hurt him, you know.

00:28:02.179 --> 00:28:06.139
But I said, “What’s the matter, where have
you been, what did you do?”

00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:11.619
And so he realized and he went out, and
really it improved.

00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:17.687
Nearness also, I think, has an effect,
because if a man like that is,

00:28:17.888 --> 00:28:22.905
or a lady like that is full of problems and
she comes

00:28:23.121 --> 00:28:31.132
very much closer to My attention, then I
have to take up the cross, it’s like this.

00:28:31.333 --> 00:28:37.395
A very simple understanding should be that,
“Why are we in Sahaja Yoga?”.

00:28:37.601 --> 00:28:44.865
We are in Sahaja Yoga to ascend, to go
higher and higher, as you sang yesterday.

00:28:45.066 --> 00:28:50.880
It was very entertaining yesterday the way
you talked about your

00:28:51.081 --> 00:28:58.877
ambition to be higher and higher. Really
it was very joy-giving, no doubt.

00:28:59.078 --> 00:29:05.159
But what are we doing about it, what are
we trying about it, we should see.

00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:09.485
Seriously we must think, are we meditating,

00:29:09.686 --> 00:29:14.928
are we all doing something to elevate
others also,

00:29:15.129 --> 00:29:18.966
to give realizations to others? Specially
women I have seen,

00:29:19.167 --> 00:29:23.996
don’t do much of this, which is very bad,
because you are the mothers.

00:29:24.197 --> 00:29:28.415
You have to go all out to give realizations
to others.

00:29:28.616 --> 00:29:34.277
But men are more active that way and women
are not. So it works the other way round.

00:29:34.478 --> 00:29:40.392
Now on one side the men are, I think are
active but don’t meditate.

00:29:40.593 --> 00:29:45.919
Women meditate and men do the outside work,
it’s sort of a part-time,

00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:54.084
or you can call it a good labor division
that, “You meditate at home

00:29:54.285 --> 00:29:57.488
and we’ll go all out”. It’s not going
to work out.

00:29:57.689 --> 00:30:04.702
So one has to meditate and one has to also
go out

00:30:04.903 --> 00:30:10.197
to spread Sahaja Yoga.  Both things have
to be done.

00:30:10.398 --> 00:30:16.775
Supposing now you meditate and you don’t
spread Sahaja Yoga, you will never ascend.

00:30:16.976 --> 00:30:22.659
Because after all this Kundalini, you see,
She’s a sensible woman, na,

00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:29.820
She’s very sensible. She thinks, “Why
should I make her a saint?

00:30:30.021 --> 00:30:35.331
What is the use?”. Sahaja Yoga is not
individualistic,

00:30:35.532 --> 00:30:41.761
it’s not for one person to become a saint
and sit somewhere, it’s not like that.

00:30:42.289 --> 00:30:46.320
It’s not meant for one person, for oneself,

00:30:46.521 --> 00:30:50.830
it’s not individualistic. It’s a collective
happening.

00:30:51.031 --> 00:30:54.097
So if you are not helping to
the collective,

00:30:54.298 --> 00:30:58.807
Kundalini says, “All right, you are
all right as it is”, just like our body.

00:30:59.008 --> 00:31:03.259
See, in our body if one organ says,
“All right, now I am all right,

00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:08.164
I am not going to work out”, or one cell
says that, “I am not going to now grow,

00:31:08.284 --> 00:31:12.226
it’s all right. Why should I worry about
the whole body?”, it won’t work.

00:31:12.427 --> 00:31:16.940
It’s a living, it’s a living organism,
I have told you hundred times,

00:31:17.141 --> 00:31:25.437
when it is a living organism it has to grow,
it has to grow and also to absorb.

00:31:25.638 --> 00:31:29.414
To have energy you have to meditate and
you have to grow.

00:31:29.615 --> 00:31:33.955
If you don’t grow, you are finished. You
are no more a Sahaja Yogi.

00:31:34.156 --> 00:31:41.083
I wouldn’t call a person a Sahaja Yogi who
has not even given one person realization.

00:31:41.563 --> 00:31:46.862
Cannot be a Sahaja Yogi, Sahaja Yogi has
to give realizations to others.

00:31:47.063 --> 00:31:50.893
Apart from other activities, the main
activity should be

00:31:51.094 --> 00:31:54.083
how we give realizations to others.

00:31:54.284 --> 00:31:59.716
Unless and until we really look after that
side of life

00:31:59.917 --> 00:32:04.324
we can never, never grow in Sahaja Yoga.

00:32:04.902 --> 00:32:12.661
For example now, take My position. I’m
all right, I’m complete, I have no problem.

00:32:12.879 --> 00:32:21.302
But why did I work so hard and wanted
so many Sahaja Yogis, why?

00:32:21.503 --> 00:32:25.495
What was the - I don’t have to grow either,
I’m overgrown already.

00:32:25.696 --> 00:32:29.060
I don’t have to do it, but why? What is
the need?

00:32:29.261 --> 00:32:33.336
The need is like this, the need is of love.

00:32:33.537 --> 00:32:37.637
I have so much love that I have
to channelize it.

00:32:37.838 --> 00:32:42.714
If I don’t I’ll suffocate, I can’t love
Myself.

00:32:42.922 --> 00:32:47.777
So this love has to spread. For that I have
to have you people,

00:32:47.978 --> 00:32:52.076
who can take this love to others and make
them happy.

00:32:52.277 --> 00:32:57.399
This is a kind of a vision I have,

00:32:57.600 --> 00:33:04.992
and in this special time, it was promised
by many people, by many saints,

00:33:05.193 --> 00:33:11.948
and it is so obvious that you are all
specially chosen for this kind of thing.

00:33:12.149 --> 00:33:17.849
Now how far you understand your importance
is a different point.

00:33:22.324 --> 00:33:29.207
You do for your emancipation, all right,
you meditate.

00:33:29.408 --> 00:33:36.410
But if you are not channelizing the love,
the Divine love, what is the use?

00:33:36.611 --> 00:33:40.278
Now supposing I repair something very
nicely:

00:33:40.479 --> 00:33:45.379
I repair this machine nicely, put it right,
everything, and I don’t speak,

00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:48.857
what’s the use of having this?

00:33:49.389 --> 00:33:54.111
In the same way, if you work very hard,
I know people who get up at four o’clock,

00:33:54.312 --> 00:33:57.354
have their baths, do meditation,

00:33:57.555 --> 00:34:02.076
sit down, in the night again they sit down
for meditation.

00:34:02.277 --> 00:34:08.371
But they never go out, they never talk
to others, they never spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:34:08.572 --> 00:34:15.971
They do not give Divine love to others, so
how can this great problem of this world

00:34:16.172 --> 00:34:22.221
be solved, that it has no love? It has
never known Divine love.

00:34:22.402 --> 00:34:28.355
It has to be given to them.

00:34:28.556 --> 00:34:37.883
They have to feel this Divine love, this
power of Adi Shakti.

00:34:38.084 --> 00:34:43.145
They have to know it. Otherwise you have
been selfish, I would say,

00:34:43.346 --> 00:34:49.741
that you had a nice time having all this
and you have not given it to others.

00:34:49.979 --> 00:34:54.375
This is the reason why Sahaja Yoga
sometimes fails

00:34:54.576 --> 00:35:00.012
to create a proper balanced personality
in a human being.

00:35:00.213 --> 00:35:04.287
Some people are like this, that now
supposing

00:35:04.488 --> 00:35:09.104
a Sahaja Yogi has married another Sahaja
Yogi, take a position like that.

00:35:09.305 --> 00:35:14.678
Now My desire is that they should develop
a complete understanding of each other,

00:35:14.879 --> 00:35:22.212
love for each other, but love for Sahaja
Yoga and for others.

00:35:22.413 --> 00:35:30.242
This is the only way we can justify
marriage in Sahaja Yoga,

00:35:30.443 --> 00:35:36.350
otherwise why should they marry? But
doesn’t happen like that.

00:35:36.551 --> 00:35:42.927
What happens is once they are married then
either they will quarrel,

00:35:43.128 --> 00:35:47.811
they will ask for divorce; if that doesn’t
happen luckily,

00:35:48.012 --> 00:35:51.381
because in Sahaja Yoga so easy to get
married, you know.

00:35:51.582 --> 00:35:57.642
If that doesn’t happen, then they start
having their own family,

00:35:57.843 --> 00:36:06.185
their own homes, they are again becoming
very small, very, very small, very limited.

00:36:06.386 --> 00:36:10.337
Did you come to Sahaja Yoga for that?

00:36:11.747 --> 00:36:14.274
You have to realize your responsibility.

00:36:14.394 --> 00:36:19.283
See this Mother Earth, how She knows
Her responsibility.

00:36:19.484 --> 00:36:26.024
She’s just made out of nothing but soil,
some mud, but look at Her.

00:36:26.225 --> 00:36:31.067
How She is conscious, how She is
particular, how She works it out,

00:36:31.268 --> 00:36:34.300
how She is attentive, how She is careful.

00:36:34.501 --> 00:36:39.866
While you, though you have been blessed
so much by everything

00:36:40.067 --> 00:36:44.938
you are, are you thinking of giving it
to others?

00:36:45.139 --> 00:36:51.495
With twelve disciples, whatever was
the problem of Christianity, I mean

00:36:51.696 --> 00:36:59.691
it was nothing good job, I must say, but
still Christianity spread out.

00:37:00.264 --> 00:37:04.349
Islam was not a very good job either,
it spread out.

00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:11.491
All those bad jobs have spread out so much,
so why not the good job of Sahaja Yoga?

00:37:11.692 --> 00:37:15.905
It has to spread, it has to go to various
places.

00:37:16.106 --> 00:37:20.274
Try and find out where you can go and talk
about it

00:37:20.475 --> 00:37:25.406
and do something good to others and help
them somehow

00:37:25.607 --> 00:37:35.877
to rise above this common existence
of misery, unhappiness and destruction.

00:37:36.108 --> 00:37:41.232
The time is very short and I think if you
see the time,

00:37:41.433 --> 00:37:46.076
the rate at which we are moving is not
proper.

00:37:46.277 --> 00:37:49.733
We have to be much faster, we have to go
much ahead

00:37:49.934 --> 00:37:55.331
and we have to create much more Sahaja
Yogis

00:37:55.532 --> 00:38:03.775
through our consistent, very intensive
effort.

00:38:03.976 --> 00:38:10.017
But we - it’s a side issue, you see, it’s
by the way, Sahaja Yoga is by the way.

00:38:10.218 --> 00:38:14.151
And this is where we are failing in our
responsibility.

00:38:14.335 --> 00:38:16.847
We have to learn from the Mother Earth.

00:38:17.048 --> 00:38:22.296
You might say that, “Mataji, how can we be
like you? After all You are Adi Shakti”.

00:38:22.497 --> 00:38:25.512
Many people say that. “You are Adi Shakti,
so what,

00:38:25.713 --> 00:38:28.788
you see, with one finger You can move
things like that”.

00:38:28.989 --> 00:38:34.941
But why should I? Why should I, what
is the need?

00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:40.569
So in that reflection that you are Me,

00:38:40.770 --> 00:38:45.584
in that reflection that the Mother Earth
is Me,

00:38:45.785 --> 00:38:50.531
in that beautiful creation within you,

00:38:50.732 --> 00:38:58.840
you have to become very sensitive
to the need of the world.

00:38:59.122 --> 00:39:03.528
What is the need of the world? Today,
if you fail,

00:39:03.729 --> 00:39:08.931
the whole thing will fail forever. Only
very few will be there.

00:39:09.132 --> 00:39:16.191
So the need for you is to spread Sahaja
Yoga, because this love

00:39:16.392 --> 00:39:21.876
is not only for you. Is not to be enjoyed
by you,

00:39:22.066 --> 00:39:29.829
but is to be enjoyed by as many possible
in the whole world.

00:39:30.030 --> 00:39:36.100
So today we have to decide that, as
the children of Adi Shakti,

00:39:36.301 --> 00:39:41.636
we have to go all out, everywhere, every
corner,

00:39:41.837 --> 00:39:51.278
we have to shout and we have to tell loudly
what is the time in which we are living,

00:39:51.479 --> 00:40:03.471
and what is the responsibility that you
have to fulfill as Sahaja Yogis.

00:40:03.672 --> 00:40:07.681
There must be some reason why you are here.

00:40:07.882 --> 00:40:13.734
Like in the beginning, Sahaja Yogis used
to ask Me, “Mother, was I this last life,

00:40:13.935 --> 00:40:18.758
was I Shivaji last life?” I said, “What’s
the use?

00:40:18.959 --> 00:40:22.172
You might have been anything, but what are
you today is much higher”.

00:40:22.373 --> 00:40:27.185
Try to understand. You might be, say,
Napoleon,

00:40:27.386 --> 00:40:34.277
you might be, say, one of the kings say,
or maybe the queen from somewhere.

00:40:34.478 --> 00:40:40.149
So what, what did they do? Did they raise
anybody’s Kundalini?

00:40:40.350 --> 00:40:44.872
Did they have any power? Even the disciples
of Christ

00:40:45.073 --> 00:40:50.535
or even Mohammed Sahib’s disciples, anyone
- did they do it?

00:40:50.736 --> 00:40:55.583
Did they have any understanding
of Kundalini?

00:40:55.784 --> 00:41:03.671
Did they have any love for others, that
they should give them realization?

00:41:03.872 --> 00:41:07.659
There were some Sufis, they never gave
realization to anyone.

00:41:07.860 --> 00:41:11.311
There were so many saints who never gave
realization to anybody.

00:41:11.512 --> 00:41:14.303
Mohammed Sahib never gave realization
to anybody.

00:41:14.504 --> 00:41:18.632
Gautam Buddha never gave realization
to anybody, think of it.

00:41:18.833 --> 00:41:22.643
Christ never gave realization to anybody.
Anybody.

00:41:22.844 --> 00:41:29.211
Krishna did not do it, Rama did not. Nobody
- but you can do it!

00:41:30.855 --> 00:41:36.182
You can do it and you know everything about
Kundalini.

00:41:36.383 --> 00:41:42.812
It’s a very big thing because you are
children of the Adi Shakti.

00:41:43.013 --> 00:41:47.255
You are here and your Mother is here.

00:41:47.456 --> 00:41:54.395
It’s a very, very fortunate thing for Me
that you are here.

00:41:54.596 --> 00:42:00.307
I’m very proud of you, but again and again
I have to tell you that

00:42:00.508 --> 00:42:06.774
the work has to be with a faster speed,
we have to move with a faster speed

00:42:06.975 --> 00:42:10.056
and get more people to Sahaja Yoga.

00:42:10.257 --> 00:42:17.009
It is rather, rather difficult for Me to say
something forcefully,

00:42:17.210 --> 00:42:22.739
that’s not My nature you know. Can’t get
into tempers and cannot get angry,

00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:30.050
and I cannot forcefully say something
to you, but if you fail,

00:42:30.251 --> 00:42:35.783
then only thing will be that you have
failed Me completely.

00:42:35.993 --> 00:42:41.288
It means that, nothing less than that, and
if you don’t want to do it,

00:42:41.489 --> 00:42:46.884
then I would request all of you to take a
vow today that you will spread Sahaja Yoga

00:42:47.085 --> 00:42:50.483
and you will talk about Sahaja Yoga, know
about Sahaj Yog.

00:42:50.684 --> 00:42:53.255
There are many who don’t know anything.

00:42:53.456 --> 00:42:57.156
Also it’s very surprising they are Sahaja
Yogis, they don’t know anything.

00:42:57.357 --> 00:43:01.127
And don’t create problems for Me, like
marriage:

00:43:01.328 --> 00:43:04.366
“We can’t now live now with the wife,
we can’t live with the husband”.

00:43:04.567 --> 00:43:10.117
All sorts of nonsensical problems people
create for Me in Sahaja Yoga.

00:43:10.318 --> 00:43:15.100
Are you here to create problems, or
to remove problems of people?

00:43:15.301 --> 00:43:20.757
So on the whole we have done well I must
say, but it’s not the final.

00:43:20.958 --> 00:43:26.983
We have to work faster with more enthusiasm
and joyfully.

00:43:27.184 --> 00:43:31.193
You don’t know what joy you get when you
give realization to somebody.

00:43:31.394 --> 00:43:37.244
It’s the most joyful moment is when you
give realizations to others.

00:43:37.445 --> 00:43:41.379
Just try, you must try once, you’ll
enjoy it,

00:43:41.580 --> 00:43:45.782
then you’ll want more and more and more.
Now after Sahaja Yoga really

00:43:45.983 --> 00:43:51.848
the want disappears into this desire that,
“My God, this man is going,

00:43:52.049 --> 00:43:53.982
should I call him and give him
realization?”

00:43:54.183 --> 00:43:56.510
On the street you will feel like calling
him, “Come here, come here,

00:43:56.711 --> 00:44:01.689
I want to give you something”, then make
him sit down, give realization.

00:44:01.890 --> 00:44:06.468
This will be your style, like mad - you’ll
say, “Oh no, no, look at this,

00:44:06.669 --> 00:44:11.546
this gentleman is without any realization,
let us give him”.

00:44:11.747 --> 00:44:14.328
You’ll have to go to churches, you’ll have
to go to universities,

00:44:14.448 --> 00:44:16.733
you have to go to all such congregations

00:44:16.934 --> 00:44:20.064
where they have no idea about what they
can achieve;

00:44:20.265 --> 00:44:24.345
and then tell them without any fear,
without any malice.

00:44:24.546 --> 00:44:26.965
You can talk to them and you should tell
them,

00:44:27.166 --> 00:44:29.601
“Now we are here to help you, for your
good.

00:44:29.802 --> 00:44:33.421
We have not come for our good but for your
good, now listen to us”.

00:44:33.622 --> 00:44:39.710
And I am sure, very sure, that the Kundalini
within you will be very happy.

00:44:39.911 --> 00:44:45.140
She is not happy you see, She is not happy
with people who are not using her fully.

00:44:45.341 --> 00:44:50.069
So She will be very happy to help you and
to do the needful

00:44:50.270 --> 00:44:53.468
for the emancipation of the whole world.

00:44:53.603 --> 00:44:56.483
May God bless you.
