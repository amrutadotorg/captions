WEBVTT

00:03.750 --> 00:10.820
Today is a special day of Guru Nanaka’s
birthday.

00:10.820 --> 00:24.810
We have celebrated one Guru puja and, as you
know that, Guru Nanak was also the incarnation

00:24.810 --> 00:26.460
of the Primordial Master.

00:26.460 --> 00:31.290
The same Spirit came on this Earth.

00:31.290 --> 00:43.459
And he’s the one who tried to re-establish
the work of Mohammed.

00:43.459 --> 00:54.510
Mohammed was the incarnation of the same Spirit
– the Primordial Master.

00:54.510 --> 00:59.590
He came on this earth to establish the religion.

00:59.590 --> 01:12.420
Islam is the name of that religion, is the
religion of every Sahaja Yogi, of every Christian,

01:12.420 --> 01:14.449
of every Hindu.

01:14.449 --> 01:28.610
We all belong to one religion which believes
in expanding our awareness to the new perception

01:28.610 --> 01:36.299
of collectivity.

01:36.299 --> 01:57.190
From human level to the higher level where
you can perceive and manifest the Divine Power.

01:57.190 --> 02:04.629
This is the religion we are following.

02:04.629 --> 02:13.929
All the religions were established on this
Earth to create the seekers.

02:13.929 --> 02:15.030
You are the seekers.

02:15.030 --> 02:17.330
You are the “men of God."

02:17.330 --> 02:24.090
Now, all of you have to become prophets.

02:24.090 --> 02:32.000
And to become prophets today’s Sahaja Yoga
has taken the form of Mahayoga.

02:32.000 --> 02:37.179
All of you have to become prophets.

02:37.179 --> 02:45.840
The prophets have two special qualities, as
all the prophets had: First of all, they have

02:45.840 --> 02:49.319
to talk about spiritual education.

02:49.319 --> 02:52.840
All of them did that.

02:52.840 --> 03:05.170
Mohammed Saheb did it, Raja Janaka did it,
Nanaka did it, Moses did it, Abraham did it.

03:05.170 --> 03:24.000
All of them prophesised and taught you how
to lead yourself in the right path, by the

03:24.000 --> 03:32.760
right action, by leading a right life.

03:32.760 --> 03:41.020
You are going to be the prophets of a little
different nature.

03:41.020 --> 03:59.530
You are prophets, you are Islamic, you are
Jews, you are Parsees, you are all those,

03:59.530 --> 04:18.879
but you are going to become prophets which
are called as “pir’ in Islam, in Hindu

04:18.879 --> 04:21.230
scriptures it’s called as “Atmasakshatkari’,
“Atmajas."

04:21.230 --> 04:39.220
In the way Nanaka has described, he calls
them “par."

04:39.220 --> 04:49.030
But you are endowed with a greater power.

04:49.030 --> 04:51.960
There’s more power in you.

04:51.960 --> 04:59.590
There they had a bigger propensity.

04:59.590 --> 05:08.460
You have another delicate power by which you
can raise the Kundalini of people.

05:08.460 --> 05:18.870
You are going to be prophets who are going
to make others prophets.

05:18.870 --> 05:26.950
Not only to establish religion but to make
them prophets.

05:26.950 --> 05:32.230
This is the most important thing.

05:32.230 --> 05:42.420
Not just to maintain a static state of righteous
religious good people but to evolve those

05:42.420 --> 05:49.540
seekers, those righteous, good, religious
people into prophets.

05:49.540 --> 06:01.290
And those prophets whom you will evolve will
also be the same type of prophets but they

06:01.290 --> 06:10.670
will also have this additional power by which
they will also evolve.

06:10.670 --> 06:14.290
That is why it is a Mahayoga.

06:14.290 --> 06:30.640
This is the greatest work in the history of
all spiritual history, that you are the prophets

06:30.640 --> 06:39.170
who are looking after the men of God, and
you are going to transform them into prophets.

06:39.170 --> 06:54.070
To have so many prophets now, for me – you
can’t imagine how happy I must be feeling.

06:54.070 --> 07:05.720
I have been, sometimes, very, very sharp with
you.

07:05.720 --> 07:09.650
Sometimes I had to goad you.

07:09.650 --> 07:20.590
Sometimes I had to love you, express my love
in that way, that you could feel that Mother

07:20.590 --> 07:24.870
is very kind.

07:24.870 --> 07:31.050
Sometimes I had to be very critical.

07:31.050 --> 07:32.390
Sometimes also angry.

07:32.390 --> 07:37.910
Behind all these aspects of your Mother, She
is nothing but Love.

07:37.910 --> 07:47.260
Because She loves you so much, and She knows
that you have to be the prophets.

07:47.260 --> 07:54.361
Your calibre may not be of the same level
as those prophets, maybe – you can’t say

07:54.361 --> 08:01.950
– but definitely you have got special powers.

08:01.950 --> 08:12.880
Like, you can say, an old Rolls Royce might
be a better car as far as the propensity goes,

08:12.880 --> 08:18.010
or an effect goes, or its behaviour goes – is
a good car.

08:18.010 --> 08:27.250
But one of the modern ones may have more capacity
to show new acrobats.

08:27.250 --> 08:36.489
For example it may tumble down, it may go
round the whole place and nothing will happen

08:36.489 --> 08:37.489
to it.

08:37.489 --> 08:44.570
Maybe, after some time, you might find a car
which goes half way and comes up a little,

08:44.570 --> 08:52.630
like a hovercraft and then goes in the air,
and then again drops back.

08:52.630 --> 09:11.930
So, this new generation of great prophets
are here before me.

09:11.930 --> 09:21.640
But the big difference between them and you
is this: that none of them had a Mother to

09:21.640 --> 09:35.580
guide them, to love them, to encourage them
when they were depressed, and also to spoil

09:35.580 --> 09:37.410
them.

09:37.410 --> 09:52.580
But you have here a Mother who may apparently
look to be spoiling her children.

09:52.580 --> 10:03.580
But She is the Master of Masters and She knows
how far to take them and how to correct them.

10:03.580 --> 10:12.240
Now, for all of you, I have to tell you that
you have to develop your independent discretion.

10:12.240 --> 10:21.130
First of all we have to know that, in this
new realm where you have entered, you have

10:21.130 --> 10:30.240
to have proper spiritual education, about
which I have given you so many lectures and

10:30.240 --> 10:31.349
things.

10:31.349 --> 10:38.729
But education doesn’t mean listening to
lectures after Realisation, it means it should

10:38.729 --> 10:47.890
be imbibed within you, it should penetrate
into your veins, and into your every artery,

10:47.890 --> 10:50.719
into every cell of your being.

10:50.719 --> 10:56.570
You have to educate yourself spiritually.

10:56.570 --> 11:09.240
And Guru Nanaka prophesised, just like William
Blake, that, “The men of God are going to

11:09.240 --> 11:16.599
come during Kali Yuga, and there will be many
prophets who will be transforming prophets,

11:16.599 --> 11:24.950
who will be transforming people into prophet
state,” [this] he had prophesised.

11:24.950 --> 11:30.149
They have all prophesised about you!

11:30.149 --> 11:38.100
Now you have to prophesise (sic) about those
who are going to be prophets.

11:38.100 --> 11:47.270
But, as it is, you know that we need spiritual
education.

11:47.270 --> 11:54.300
Because your Guru is a Mother we lack discipline.

11:54.300 --> 12:00.219
There’s complete freedom for all of you.

12:00.219 --> 12:05.669
You know that if you go to a guru what kind
of discipline you have to observe!

12:05.669 --> 12:10.380
I mean the real one, also.

12:10.380 --> 12:12.730
Unreal, of course.

12:12.730 --> 12:18.260
But even the real ones, how they test your
attention.

12:18.260 --> 12:24.529
Even for the smallest thing, how they treat
you.

12:24.529 --> 12:32.969
I’ll give an example of Ravi Shankar, who
was a very great, you know, who is a very

12:32.969 --> 12:43.810
great sitar player: my father was an advisor
to the Maharaja of Maihar where their guru

12:43.810 --> 12:47.260
(Allauddin Khan) was living.

12:47.260 --> 12:53.740
This guru was a Muslim but he used to worship
Kali, Mother.

12:53.740 --> 12:56.070
He used to worship Mother!

12:56.070 --> 12:57.810
And [a] very self disciplined man.

12:57.810 --> 13:06.350
They say he died at the age of 110 or 120
– Allauddin Khan Saheb.

13:06.350 --> 13:12.840
And this Ravi Shankar was there.

13:12.840 --> 13:19.770
I saw him as a young man, and this Ali Akbar
(Allauddin Khan’s son) whom you heard.

13:19.770 --> 13:23.109
They were literally frightened of their guru,
who was a master himself.

13:23.109 --> 13:28.440
He knew so many of these instruments.

13:28.440 --> 13:37.639
One day my father, whom he used to respect
very much, always used to bow to him, though

13:37.639 --> 13:43.130
he was a Muslim, they touched feet because
my father was a great connoisseur of music,

13:43.130 --> 13:50.359
and a supporter of music, and he bowed to
him and he said, “Now, should I play?”

13:50.359 --> 13:52.810
So he said, “Why not ask your disciple,
this Ravi Shankar, to play?”

13:52.810 --> 13:57.560
And he said, “Yes, yes, come along, play."

13:57.560 --> 13:58.560
he said, “Not today sir.

13:58.560 --> 13:59.960
Please, not today."

13:59.960 --> 14:02.550
he was very frightened.

14:02.550 --> 14:08.209
Then he said, “Alright, let it be!” he
started playing.

14:08.209 --> 14:10.060
He used to play on mrudangam.

14:10.060 --> 14:14.459
Used to play beautiful mrudangam – tremendous!

14:14.459 --> 14:19.240
I mean, you can’t imagine! he was a Realised-soul,
no doubt.

14:19.240 --> 14:26.539
Then Ravi Shankar, when he finished and he
bowed to my father and he went away.

14:26.539 --> 14:31.829
Then Ravi Shankar came to my father and he
said, “Don’t ask me to play before my

14:31.829 --> 14:35.020
guruji!” he lifted his head and said, “See
here.

14:35.020 --> 14:36.949
Do you see this bump?

14:36.949 --> 14:44.359
This morning only, he hit me with my sitar,
which he broke, and this is the bump I have

14:44.359 --> 14:45.359
got!”

14:45.359 --> 14:47.990
So my father said, “What did you do?”

14:47.990 --> 14:52.350
he said, “Only one note I played wrong!

14:52.350 --> 14:58.820
That too not wrong but little out of tune,
and on that point he has broken this part

14:58.820 --> 15:04.030
of my head and I have been in this terrible
pain and he said, “You are not to see any

15:04.030 --> 15:05.030
doctor!”

15:05.030 --> 15:06.030
And really there was a big bump.

15:06.030 --> 15:09.839
He had covered it like that, with the hair.

15:09.839 --> 15:21.649
(Laughter) That’s why today they have fame
as great masters, because to be masters you

15:21.649 --> 15:27.789
have to obey your master and to discipline
yourself.

15:27.789 --> 15:36.960
The spiritual education in Sahaja Yoga, under
Mataji Nirmala Devi, is absolutely left to

15:36.960 --> 15:57.700
your own wisdom: there is no force, there
is no compulsion, there is no organisation.

15:57.700 --> 16:07.039
It is you who has to feel the joy of your
Spirit and it is you who has to share it with

16:07.039 --> 16:08.039
others.

16:08.039 --> 16:16.620
It is you who has to raise the Kundalini of
others.

16:16.620 --> 16:36.370
Now, today, when we are thinking of a Great
Prophet who, on this Earth, came to establish

16:36.370 --> 16:42.620
good relationships between Hindus and Muslims.

16:42.620 --> 16:50.479
Imagine, when Mohammed Sahib came he did not
know that he was facing these horrible people

16:50.479 --> 16:53.810
there who murdered him.

16:53.810 --> 16:57.209
Actually they murdered him.

16:57.209 --> 17:00.609
They gave him poison.

17:00.609 --> 17:12.120
And when he died he said that, “There will
not be any need for any prophet to come in."

17:12.120 --> 17:17.140
Naturally, if you torture somebody, what else
he’s going to say?

17:17.140 --> 17:24.370
Also, he felt that whatever he has said, being
such a truth, it will definitely prosper and

17:24.370 --> 17:28.300
the seed has been sown.

17:28.300 --> 17:34.350
And he said, “There is no need for another
advent of a master."

17:34.350 --> 17:46.980
But he found out that there was a big aggression
by the so-called followers of Mohammed, who

17:46.980 --> 17:54.350
talked of nothing but rehmat (رحمت) – is
compassion.

17:54.350 --> 18:08.140
Now, before his death he encountered all kinds
of attacks from the negative people.

18:08.140 --> 18:14.030
Of all of them, the worst of all!

18:14.030 --> 18:16.220
I think he has suffered the worst.

18:16.220 --> 18:23.740
He had to move from places to places, hiding
the children away from negative forces, [from]

18:23.740 --> 18:24.880
tribes to tribes.

18:24.880 --> 18:40.530
It was a tremendous life, the way he led it.

18:40.530 --> 18:51.470
And all his life there was nothing but struggle
for existence.

18:51.470 --> 18:56.550
Only struggle for existence.

18:56.550 --> 19:13.490
When Nanaka came in, he saw that Hindus and
Muslims were fighting, so he started his theme

19:13.490 --> 19:27.080
with Kabira, saying that, “Ram and Rahim
are both the same, and how can you differentiate

19:27.080 --> 19:28.320
between the two?”

19:28.320 --> 19:34.230
All their theme was like this, of integration
of these two main religions which existed

19:34.230 --> 19:40.310
in India.

19:40.310 --> 19:43.170
That time, there was no question of giving
Realisation.

19:43.170 --> 19:50.100
People were trying to defend their faiths
and fight each other and kill each other.

19:50.100 --> 19:51.100
Imagine!

19:51.100 --> 19:53.190
Created by the same Spirit!

19:53.190 --> 19:54.400
Fighting among themselves!

19:54.400 --> 19:58.740
How silly it must be, and absurd.

19:58.740 --> 20:03.050
In many places Nanak Saheb has proved that
he was Mohammed.

20:03.050 --> 20:10.720
Once, he was lying down and his feet were
towards Mecca.

20:10.720 --> 20:13.110
So people said, “How can you put your feet
towards Mecca?”

20:13.110 --> 20:15.800
He had Muslim disciples and also Hindu disciples.

20:15.800 --> 20:18.130
He said, “Alright, whichever way you say,
I’ll put my feet."

20:18.130 --> 20:21.500
He turned round his feet.

20:21.500 --> 20:24.060
They said, “Still you are towards Mecca."

20:24.060 --> 20:30.730
He went round and round and round [but] still
they saw him facing Mecca!

20:30.730 --> 20:43.680
And they could not understand how it was that
he was facing, his feet were towards Mecca,

20:43.680 --> 20:46.440
that Mecca was at his lotus feet.

20:46.440 --> 20:49.560
Same with Mohammed.

20:49.560 --> 20:59.510
Now, all these great incarnations had a special
power over water.

20:59.510 --> 21:09.820
Because you know, in the stomach we have our
Void and Nabhi Chakra which is made of ocean.

21:09.820 --> 21:19.920
Ocean represents the incarnation of Adi Guru
– Dattatreya.

21:19.920 --> 21:24.500
These had great powers over oceans and over
water.

21:24.500 --> 21:32.620
Like Moses – he crossed the ocean by creating
a road.

21:32.620 --> 21:39.070
That’s one of the very significant things
which shows that the Void can be crossed with

21:39.070 --> 21:40.850
the help of the Guru.

21:40.850 --> 21:48.320
And even Mohammed Saheb had a tremendous power
over ocean.

21:48.320 --> 21:56.950
Then, Nanaka once put his hand on a rock and
water started coming out of that.

21:56.950 --> 22:01.950
People were amazed how it started.

22:01.950 --> 22:04.490
And that’s why it is called as ‘Punja-saheb’.

22:04.490 --> 22:06.050
‘Punja’ means ‘the hand’.

22:06.050 --> 22:08.110
‘Punja’ means ‘the five fingers’,
like this.

22:08.110 --> 22:18.030
What do you say to this, this part, [of the]
hand?

22:18.030 --> 22:21.890
Hand with five fingers?

22:21.890 --> 22:23.970
Yogis: This is the palm.

22:23.970 --> 22:25.530
Shri Mataji: No, no, not the palm!

22:25.530 --> 22:27.220
The whole thing.

22:27.220 --> 22:28.220
Like this is a punja.

22:28.220 --> 22:29.220
‘Hand’.

22:29.220 --> 22:30.220
Yogis: The hand.

22:30.220 --> 22:31.220
The open hand.

22:31.220 --> 22:34.910
Shri Mataji: But hand can be like this (a
fist) you see?

22:34.910 --> 22:35.910
This way.

22:35.910 --> 22:37.460
There’s no word, alright.

22:37.460 --> 22:39.930
So this is ‘punja’ – this is five.

22:39.930 --> 22:50.960
And ‘punjab’ is five waters, five rivers
– in that area – are called Punjab.

22:50.960 --> 22:58.140
Now, another thing about these: all these
incarnations had to deal with your attention.

22:58.140 --> 23:02.850
So they were particular about looking after
your attention.

23:02.850 --> 23:12.910
And that is why, from the time Moses or Abraham
came in, they talked of no alcoholism.

23:12.910 --> 23:16.530
All of them.

23:16.530 --> 23:24.040
It is written very clearly in The Bible that
the strong alcohols, fermented, should not

23:24.040 --> 23:25.040
be taken.

23:25.040 --> 23:26.950
If you don’t want to read it, one need not.

23:26.950 --> 23:32.000
But they think it was Moses who said it and
Christ did not say – so Christians can take

23:32.000 --> 23:33.980
it, the Moses people should not take it.

23:33.980 --> 23:39.970
There is no breaking of link between Moses
and Christ.

23:39.970 --> 23:44.340
They are of the same tree, of the same pattern,
of the same thing.

23:44.340 --> 23:51.950
But those who want to use Moses for their
own purpose will follow as much as Moses has

23:51.950 --> 23:57.860
said, and those who want to follow Christ
will follow only as much as Christ has said,

23:57.860 --> 24:00.690
because it’s very good for them.

24:00.690 --> 24:07.880
For such useless people Sahaja Yoga has no
place.

24:07.880 --> 24:17.240
We have to understand that all these people
have said for our good and for the maintenance

24:17.240 --> 24:25.410
of our spiritual life and none of them are
to be criticised or to be challenged but to

24:25.410 --> 24:29.870
be fully respected as our Guru.

24:29.870 --> 24:32.310
All of them.

24:32.310 --> 24:39.670
Whether one belongs to Islam religion or to
the Jew religion or to the Christian religion

24:39.670 --> 24:41.230
or to the Hindu religion.

24:41.230 --> 24:48.120
And if they are fanatic they are going against
their guru – it is against their guru.

24:48.120 --> 24:52.970
So, they were against fanaticism.

24:52.970 --> 24:54.920
First thing they were against [was] alcoholism.

24:54.920 --> 25:00.320
That’s the first thing, they thought, because
somehow human beings take to alcoholism very

25:00.320 --> 25:01.320
fast.

25:01.320 --> 25:07.360
At the time of Mohammed Saheb, people did
not know how to smoke.

25:07.360 --> 25:11.670
Then they developed, became modern.

25:11.670 --> 25:15.540
At the time of Nanaka they started smoking
so he prohibited that.

25:15.540 --> 25:23.110
But Mohammed Sahib said that, “Anything
that goes against your awareness, any intoxication

25:23.110 --> 25:34.920
of any kind” – he generally, he gave a
very general instruction, “is against God."

25:34.920 --> 25:44.510
So, our training, our spiritual education
should be that we cannot be fanatics anymore.

25:44.510 --> 25:53.220
If you are fanatic anymore, or you are identified
with any one of your old ideas, then beware!

25:53.220 --> 25:59.360
Be very, very careful!

25:59.360 --> 26:06.810
You cannot have fanatic ideas anymore if you
want to be a good Sahaja Yogi or a Maha Yogi

26:06.810 --> 26:15.180
– meaning a person who is a prophet, not
only a prophet, but who is capable of transforming

26:15.180 --> 26:21.290
others into prophets.

26:21.290 --> 26:25.990
First is, you have to be away from alcoholism.

26:25.990 --> 26:28.870
You should be deadly against it.

26:28.870 --> 26:37.150
Whenever you have a chance you find it that
it is possible for you to say something against

26:37.150 --> 26:38.150
alcoholism.

26:38.150 --> 26:42.500
It should be absolutely boycotted.

26:42.500 --> 26:55.290
Every place, anywhere you meet, it should
be smoking or any kind of intoxication, drugging,

26:55.290 --> 27:03.330
anything, has to be completely branded as
anti-God, anti-Sahaja Yoga.

27:03.330 --> 27:08.570
Then, fanaticism of any kind.

27:08.570 --> 27:10.030
That lingers on.

27:10.030 --> 27:14.400
This is another very deep misidentification.

27:14.400 --> 27:17.280
I am aware of it.

27:17.280 --> 27:26.190
I did not talk of Catholicism till the other
day I went to Portugal, when I had to talk.

27:26.190 --> 27:28.000
So I said [for the] first time.

27:28.000 --> 27:34.400
I never talked about Protestants before, till
I had to talk that they are another mad race

27:34.400 --> 27:35.400
going round!

27:35.400 --> 27:38.510
There are 27 churches of this kind.

27:38.510 --> 27:49.680
None of them, except for we, are really Christians.

27:49.680 --> 27:58.270
All are nonsensical fanatics: Seventh Day
Adventists and Pentecostals, and this and

27:58.270 --> 28:00.230
that.

28:00.230 --> 28:02.550
All are absurd ideas!

28:02.550 --> 28:06.970
All are playing into the hands of bhoots,
take it from me.

28:06.970 --> 28:10.060
They have nothing to do with God, they are
anti-God.

28:10.060 --> 28:18.350
All those who still stick on to all these
churches and to this kind of fanaticism – I

28:18.350 --> 28:25.730
am saying here of churches because here I
have to talk about churches – should know

28:25.730 --> 28:29.960
that all these churches have now become the
place of bhoots.

28:29.960 --> 28:36.730
You’ll go to one church and you’ll rush
to me!

28:36.730 --> 28:43.990
From my house I see in the night, hosts of
bhoots waiting out of the church.

28:43.990 --> 28:52.830
(Laughter) I do not know! (laughing) And somehow
it’s happening that, whatever house I decide

28:52.830 --> 28:53.830
to stay in, there’s a big church in front
of me.

28:53.830 --> 28:56.930
(Laughter) It may be a Catholic church, may
be a Protestant church.

28:56.930 --> 29:06.270
And they have seen to it that they make it
really bhootish by making all those who die

29:06.270 --> 29:10.490
stay in that church.

29:10.490 --> 29:14.050
They are not Realised people.

29:14.050 --> 29:19.130
Realised people only should be buried and
all others should be burnt off.

29:19.130 --> 29:20.130
It’s better.

29:20.130 --> 29:22.420
At least the bhoots go out of them.

29:22.420 --> 29:27.630
And they are roaming about in the church,
and you are taking the children down there

29:27.630 --> 29:29.560
into the cemetery!

29:29.560 --> 29:35.340
Apart from that wherever there is a anadhikaar
cheshta (अनधिकार चेष्टा

29:35.340 --> 29:39.350
meaning ‘unauthorised activity’) – when
it is unauthorised – Gods do not exist there.

29:39.350 --> 29:41.450
They leave the place.

29:41.450 --> 29:48.590
So, we have to know that we are no more fanatics.

29:48.590 --> 29:52.560
First and foremost thing is that we cannot
be fanatics.

29:52.560 --> 30:00.930
Now, training ourselves is very important,
spiritual education is very important.

30:00.930 --> 30:09.120
But in Sahaja Yoga, as your Mother is a very
kind teacher, but even such a kind teacher

30:09.120 --> 30:16.680
is not such a help sometimes because all corrections
are left to yourself, and then you commit

30:16.680 --> 30:21.940
really blunders and then you think, “Why
didn’t Mother tell us?

30:21.940 --> 30:25.360
Why didn’t She protect us, why didn’t
She correct?”

30:25.360 --> 30:32.600
But this is the style I have adopted because
in modern times, Sahaja Yoga is working out

30:32.600 --> 30:35.850
because I do not challenge your ego.

30:35.850 --> 30:40.970
Otherwise you would have crucified me long
time back.

30:40.970 --> 30:44.240
So I leave it to you to decide to discipline
yourself.

30:44.240 --> 30:49.330
It is for you to discipline yourself and understand
yourself.

30:49.330 --> 30:56.840
Now, the best way to discipline yourself is
to find out, “What’s wrong with me?”

30:56.840 --> 30:57.840
Not with others.

30:57.840 --> 30:59.360
We are very good at that.

30:59.360 --> 31:03.670
I have seen every day there’s some complaint
about somebody coming from someone.

31:03.670 --> 31:12.650
But there are very few who will say, “This
is wrong with me, Mother, what to do?”

31:12.650 --> 31:16.740
So just try to find out what is wrong with
you.

31:16.740 --> 31:19.190
You are like a fort.

31:19.190 --> 31:24.200
The fort has some sort of a weakness.

31:24.200 --> 31:32.410
So, the man in charge of the fort – what
do you call him?

31:32.410 --> 31:39.390
We call kiledaar ( किलेदार ) because
a fort is kila and the gentleman is the owner

31:39.390 --> 31:41.910
of the kila, is called as kiledaar.

31:41.910 --> 31:50.800
Now, this kiledaar finds out what are the
weak points of the fort and he sees to it

31:50.800 --> 31:53.350
that they are all corrected one by one.

31:53.350 --> 31:57.480
We are just the other way round.

31:57.480 --> 32:02.500
We know we have weaknesses which we hide and
keep them there as they are.

32:02.500 --> 32:09.120
Whatever strong points we have that we boast
of and we try to see the weaknesses of others,

32:09.120 --> 32:16.030
and from these loopholes all these negative
things creep in and suddenly you find that

32:16.030 --> 32:18.730
you are finished.

32:18.730 --> 32:25.490
So try to find out what are your weaknesses.

32:25.490 --> 32:34.240
One of the weaknesses, which is very common
is that we are very materialistic people,

32:34.240 --> 32:39.770
we are still very materialistic, extremely
materialistic.

32:39.770 --> 32:47.680
And the materialism is getting subtler and
subtler the subtler we be.

32:47.680 --> 32:50.180
Try to give up some things.

32:50.180 --> 33:00.300
Keep a kind of a little balanced attitude,
a little detached attitude, not too many things.

33:00.300 --> 33:04.710
Few things of value.

33:04.710 --> 33:06.110
Try to detach yourself.

33:06.110 --> 33:08.270
I don’t say you become sanyasis.

33:08.270 --> 33:11.110
That is also another thing against.

33:11.110 --> 33:14.600
But from inside you detach.

33:14.600 --> 33:27.030
See, I’m wearing a very nice sari, but from
inside see what is the colour.

33:27.030 --> 33:28.360
(Laughter)

33:28.360 --> 33:33.590
From inside you should be detached, not from
outside.

33:33.590 --> 33:37.730
So that, try to practice this detachment.

33:37.730 --> 33:41.850
Whatever you want to possess, you just don’t
possess.

33:41.850 --> 33:45.350
Teach your body, teach your mind: “No!

33:45.350 --> 33:48.540
You want a shirt?

33:48.540 --> 33:50.470
No!Nothing doing!”

33:50.470 --> 33:51.470
You try.

33:51.470 --> 33:53.370
Train up your body.

33:53.370 --> 33:58.520
Now some people want comfort, the body wants
comfort.

33:58.520 --> 34:01.320
Alright, “You want comfort?

34:01.320 --> 34:07.530
No, I will sleep on the ground and teach you
a lesson!”

34:07.530 --> 34:10.689
Teach your body a lesson!

34:10.689 --> 34:14.259
Teach your wants and desires a lesson!

34:14.259 --> 34:16.719
Let’s see what happens.

34:16.719 --> 34:22.570
Now, I don’t know why, but in England it
should not be so.

34:22.570 --> 34:26.790
I mean I expected people absolutely detached
because they have got everything.

34:26.790 --> 34:31.800
But here it is much more attachment than detachment.

34:31.800 --> 34:36.179
There is no satisfaction of any kind.

34:36.179 --> 34:50.949
So, a kind of a detachment must be developed,
to your desires, to your belongings, to your

34:50.949 --> 34:58.089
possessions and whatever kind of a material
aspect you want to build up.

34:58.089 --> 35:06.109
I always said that you must not look like
people who are coming from the lunatic asylum,

35:06.109 --> 35:13.179
that’s true, but you should also not look
like a dandy person, with a flair, a big bow

35:13.179 --> 35:16.720
here, and a sort of a thing.

35:16.720 --> 35:18.659
You should be in the centre.

35:18.659 --> 35:24.070
And how are you in centre?

35:24.070 --> 35:25.310
When you are detached.

35:25.310 --> 35:26.860
Then nothing can impress you.

35:26.860 --> 35:34.189
But that doesn’t mean…some people I’ve
seen that outside they make a show, that they

35:34.189 --> 35:40.220
are absolutely dishevelled, absolutely in
a very filthy condition, smelling like pigs.

35:40.220 --> 35:43.960
(Laughter) They think they are going to take
an avatara of Varaha (boar incarnation of

35:43.960 --> 35:48.899
Shri Vishnu) by smelling like pigs!

35:48.899 --> 35:56.600
And all sorts of funny things they do in the
name of detachment.

35:56.600 --> 35:59.149
No – detachment is within.

35:59.149 --> 36:03.949
Try to practice it.

36:03.949 --> 36:07.379
That is one of the educations you have to
develop.

36:07.379 --> 36:09.679
How do you develop that detachment?

36:09.679 --> 36:13.429
Is by giving things away.

36:13.429 --> 36:17.629
Not to me, but giving things away to others.

36:17.629 --> 36:21.699
Say you reach a certain state of – say you
have two suits.

36:21.699 --> 36:25.150
If you have a third one then give it away.

36:25.150 --> 36:26.189
Give away things.

36:26.189 --> 36:34.579
It’s a very good way of developing detachment,
and enjoying the giving away than possessing.

36:34.579 --> 36:42.440
It’s greater, is much greater, take it from
me, is much greater than possessing.

36:42.440 --> 36:54.129
Now for you, at this stage, I cannot say,
but maybe after some time, it will become

36:54.129 --> 37:01.080
that I prophesise that you will become sinless,
absolutely sinless.

37:01.080 --> 37:04.810
You cannot do sin and whatever you do will
not be sin.

37:04.810 --> 37:06.990
I am sinless.

37:06.990 --> 37:13.060
Even if I rob you of all your wealth nobody
can say I have committed sin.

37:13.060 --> 37:16.270
I am absolutely sinless.

37:16.270 --> 37:23.480
Even if I kill thousands and thousands of
people nobody would say that I have killed

37:23.480 --> 37:25.260
because I am sinless.

37:25.260 --> 37:36.240
But, despite all that state, I do not commit
any so-called sin because I have to lay down

37:36.240 --> 37:41.720
my life in such a way that you people follow.

37:41.720 --> 37:47.839
That you should not tomorrow say that, “Mother
did this, She has done this so why not we?”

37:47.839 --> 37:50.649
That’s why I’m so very particular.

37:50.649 --> 38:00.560
At the same point I would like to tell you
that today Chaya, in her sweetness, went and

38:00.560 --> 38:03.169
bought a very expensive sari.

38:03.169 --> 38:12.240
And she brought with such love and affection
to me, that I had told her just buy me a £10

38:12.240 --> 38:17.710
worth of a shawl and she couldn’t bear the
idea.

38:17.710 --> 38:27.790
But she should know [that] for me anything
is valuable that you give to me.

38:27.790 --> 38:30.649
Nothing expensive is needed.

38:30.649 --> 38:38.230
Even if you give me the most expensive I have
every right on that.

38:38.230 --> 38:46.760
But you must understand that if this practice
is continued too much it will create a bad

38:46.760 --> 38:47.760
public opinion.

38:47.760 --> 38:54.770
So, at the most, definitely decide that you’ll
give me only two saris, that’s all.

38:54.770 --> 38:57.599
I don’t need even these two.

38:57.599 --> 38:58.850
And I can have all of them.

38:58.850 --> 39:04.640
So, the situation is such that we have to
be very careful about the public opinion,

39:04.640 --> 39:07.080
and people may start saying tomorrow, “Oh!

39:07.080 --> 39:09.990
Mother, She wears all expensive saris."

39:09.990 --> 39:15.030
Let my husband buy for me, he has lots of
money!

39:15.030 --> 39:18.490
And you can buy me very ordinary things.

39:18.490 --> 39:22.169
And I told once Modi that, “You buy me khadi
(homespun) saris, that’s the best,” but

39:22.169 --> 39:23.280
he couldn’t bear it.

39:23.280 --> 39:24.550
It was too much for him.

39:24.550 --> 39:30.230
He says that, “Mother, we are middle class
people and we are giving you something middle

39:30.230 --> 39:31.230
class."

39:31.230 --> 39:32.230
I said, “Alright."

39:32.230 --> 39:35.530
So, once for all I told them, “Alright,
you buy some saris."

39:35.530 --> 39:39.880
And then I bought for them, one of them is
this one, and I don’t know if the whole

39:39.880 --> 39:41.800
money is paid – most of the money I have
paid.

39:41.800 --> 39:47.790
But still, you know, there was somebody who
came out with an objection!

39:47.790 --> 39:55.570
I know you love me very much and you want
to do something for me like that, but I would

39:55.570 --> 40:03.230
request that try to get things which are sober
and simple for me.

40:03.230 --> 40:09.819
By God’s Grace, you should know your Mother
is looked after, you don’t have to worry.

40:09.819 --> 40:20.480
Supposing I was a beggar then you would have
had to spend much more money but that is not

40:20.480 --> 40:21.480
so.

40:21.480 --> 40:25.080
And it is not that it is in any way wrong,
on the contrary, it’s a very great thing.

40:25.080 --> 40:30.040
After all these are going to be in your Mother’s
personal archives and people are going to

40:30.040 --> 40:35.230
see what saris you people gave me, and they’re
going to be very happy – of course, no doubt

40:35.230 --> 40:37.930
– and that’s going to be very, very great
for you.

40:37.930 --> 40:44.340
But, still, where the public is concerned
you be careful and understand that when you

40:44.340 --> 40:52.010
do anything like that for me, this public
is mad and we have to keep a proper balance.

40:52.010 --> 41:03.599
Now, about training yourself, as I said, detachment,
then another thing is astuteness – astuteness.

41:03.599 --> 41:09.869
Try to develop astute habits – astute – specially
for religious work.

41:09.869 --> 41:16.840
First of all understand that you have to give
some money for Sahaja Yoga work.

41:16.840 --> 41:18.610
In that you should be astute.

41:18.610 --> 41:25.130
I was amazed to hear from some people that
for food also you want to have free – that

41:25.130 --> 41:28.359
sometimes you had food you didn’t pay even
one pound.

41:28.359 --> 41:30.090
I mean this is absurd.

41:30.090 --> 41:36.290
If you were beggars is alright, but for Sahaja
Yoga, first of all, it’s not too much.

41:36.290 --> 41:39.220
But little you have to pay.

41:39.220 --> 41:41.609
And you should not make your Mother pay for
you.

41:41.609 --> 41:42.609
It’s wrong.

41:42.609 --> 41:47.040
I never said this before, but today I’m
telling you.

41:47.040 --> 41:52.000
Not aesthetically, but spiritually it is wrong
that I should pay for you.

41:52.000 --> 41:57.210
It’s alright – I may give you a dinner,
it’s different, I may give you anything,

41:57.210 --> 42:04.100
it’s different, but that you should not
try to take advantage in any way or exploit

42:04.100 --> 42:13.619
in any way this Mother of yours, who has got
lots of things other than what you know of,

42:13.619 --> 42:17.050
which can work out against your spiritual
growth.

42:17.050 --> 42:20.530
So just don’t do anything like that.

42:20.530 --> 42:22.970
No exploitation.

42:22.970 --> 42:25.419
Learn that.

42:25.419 --> 42:30.270
Those who have done such a thing must decide
that no more like that.

42:30.270 --> 42:35.689
Now, I’ll tell you a difference between
Indians and you people is this: that an Indian

42:35.689 --> 42:37.970
would never do that.

42:37.970 --> 42:43.619
We had one Indian coming here and he was not
such a big Sahaja Yogi, but he used to come

42:43.619 --> 42:47.820
for his puja, and he would not take money
for his puja and these people had to fight

42:47.820 --> 42:48.820
with him.

42:48.820 --> 42:50.629
Ask him, he’s sitting down, he would not
take.

42:50.629 --> 42:55.349
But how materialistic we are!

42:55.349 --> 43:00.990
And then, when people mesmerise you then you
buy a Rolls Royce for that person, and here

43:00.990 --> 43:06.630
a Mother is giving you all the freedom, so
you are exploiting your Mother!

43:06.630 --> 43:11.330
“I have no job,” all this is wrong.

43:11.330 --> 43:15.760
You must pay for your food, and must pay where
you have to pay.

43:15.760 --> 43:20.100
That’s your dharma, that’s your religion,
of every Sahaja Yogi.

43:20.100 --> 43:26.040
Alright, you need not pay too much, but you
must pay where it has to be paid.

43:26.040 --> 43:28.980
And never take a parasitic attitude.

43:28.980 --> 43:33.369
That will kill your growth, will dwarf you.

43:33.369 --> 43:36.510
I am warning you about it.

43:36.510 --> 43:37.510
Astuteness.

43:37.510 --> 43:43.159
For payment, for accounting, for everything,
one has to be extremely astute.

43:43.159 --> 43:48.689
Like, I’ll tell you, I have seen people
used to come to my house, long time back – I

43:48.689 --> 43:52.669
shouldn’t say this but [it] used to be so
funny – they would go in the kitchen, take

43:52.669 --> 43:55.550
out anything, eat anything, walk off anywhere.

43:55.550 --> 43:57.689
It was amazing!

43:57.689 --> 43:59.240
Our cooks could not understand.

43:59.240 --> 44:00.510
Nobody could understand such people.

44:00.510 --> 44:06.439
Just coming in the house, walking into the
kitchen, taking off whatever they like, eat

44:06.439 --> 44:07.439
anything.

44:07.439 --> 44:08.439
Like bounders!

44:08.439 --> 44:21.000
This training has to come within you where
you must realise and understand that astuteness

44:21.000 --> 44:26.319
towards Sahaja Yoga has to be maintained.

44:26.319 --> 44:34.609
Like going into the ashram, walking into somebody’s
kitchen, taking out things.

44:34.609 --> 44:41.520
Using the ashram in a state as if it does
not matter.

44:41.520 --> 44:42.520
It’s ashram!

44:42.520 --> 44:44.740
It’s a pure thing.

44:44.740 --> 44:46.750
You cannot fight in an ashram.

44:46.750 --> 44:49.439
You cannot talk loudly in an ashram.

44:49.439 --> 44:52.099
You have to lead a pure life in an ashram.

44:52.099 --> 44:54.839
You cannot play games with each other.

44:54.839 --> 44:56.480
You cannot make it dirty.

44:56.480 --> 45:00.569
You cannot spoil it, otherwise your spiritual
growth won’t come up.

45:00.569 --> 45:06.179
This is the simplest thing one should know,
is to respect Sahaja Yoga.

45:06.179 --> 45:09.189
Love without respect has no meaning.

45:09.189 --> 45:13.869
You have to respect, and respect the place,
respect everything.

45:13.869 --> 45:18.369
Keep it clean, be astute about it.

45:18.369 --> 45:21.210
And this is one of the greatest trainings.

45:21.210 --> 45:27.129
I don’t know how, but to a British mind
it should not be told, because they are known

45:27.129 --> 45:28.740
for this kind of a training!

45:28.740 --> 45:40.199
But I don’t know, because now you are saints,
I think, I feel that you have had other kind

45:40.199 --> 45:45.560
of training before, that you are born as saints.

45:45.560 --> 45:54.750
Perhaps you have no self-esteem yet, of the
value that should be given to your own character.

45:54.750 --> 45:59.449
Without that, nobody is going to be impressed
by you.

45:59.449 --> 46:02.220
Nobody is going to be impressed by you.

46:02.220 --> 46:04.000
Nobody is going to become a prophet.

46:04.000 --> 46:06.830
You have to first of all impress.

46:06.830 --> 46:09.890
You have to dress up in such a way that you
impress others.

46:09.890 --> 46:14.850
It’s a very important thing in Sahaja Yoga.

46:14.850 --> 46:17.609
You have to talk in such a way that you impress
others.

46:17.609 --> 46:22.919
Supposing somebody’s very fat, he must reduce,
somebody’s very thin, he must put on.

46:22.919 --> 46:25.939
He must try to have a body of the centre.

46:25.939 --> 46:31.050
Should not allow the body to move this way
or that way.

46:31.050 --> 46:38.679
One has to be in a proper shape, in proper
dress, because you have to impress on others.

46:38.679 --> 46:43.310
You must know that if the personality is not
impressive how are you going to communicate?

46:43.310 --> 46:48.829
Because first of all the people see you, those
of you who come to you, see your outside.

46:48.829 --> 46:52.939
They don’t see your vibrations they see
your outside.

46:52.939 --> 47:01.199
So, all of you must learn how to dress up
and how to behave towards others, how to appear

47:01.199 --> 47:07.480
before others, how to talk to others, so that
you become prophets who will do wonders and

47:07.480 --> 47:15.850
who will transform many, many, many more people
into the same state as you are.

47:15.850 --> 47:21.339
Now, this training you have to take yourself.

47:21.339 --> 47:27.179
The another point in training in Sahaja Yoga
is that you have to read.

47:27.179 --> 47:36.669
There are many people who have not read even
Gregoire’s book, leave alone any other.

47:36.669 --> 47:44.869
You have to learn certain things like chakras
and centres and mantras and you have to dedicate.

47:44.869 --> 47:49.772
Even people like Vivekanada’s who never
got Realisation – do you know, these people,

47:49.772 --> 47:54.399
twelve people – they used to study for fourteen
hours.

47:54.399 --> 48:03.389
Now you will know what to study, what not
to study, and even if you study wrong things,

48:03.389 --> 48:04.389
you will know where it is wrong.

48:04.389 --> 48:05.389
So you have to study.

48:05.389 --> 48:08.689
For example, there are Jews with us – let
them study Torah and see there where is it,

48:08.689 --> 48:10.000
Sahaja Yoga, in there written down.

48:10.000 --> 48:11.620
Find it out!

48:11.620 --> 48:15.329
If you are Christians read the Bible, find
out.

48:15.329 --> 48:19.800
You should read Gita, you should read Upanishadas,
and you should be masters.

48:19.800 --> 48:27.179
You’ll find that Sahaj Yoga is such a light
that you will know what it is.

48:27.179 --> 48:33.669
We have got the Devi’s names and the Sahastranamas:
try to read them and try to understand the

48:33.669 --> 48:37.540
meaning of that and try to understand what
it means, how far it goes.

48:37.540 --> 48:43.050
That’s how the depth of your knowledge will
increase and your Sahaja Yoga will tell you

48:43.050 --> 48:48.699
what is right and what is wrong.

48:48.699 --> 48:54.559
Now emotionally, some of you have terribly
emotional weaknesses: the idea of ‘love’.

48:54.559 --> 49:02.050
[About] that I must speak to you because it
has come from a group of people who went into

49:02.050 --> 49:04.760
another style against the ego-oriented people.

49:04.760 --> 49:09.370
And they believe that love means hugging each
other, kissing each other.

49:09.370 --> 49:13.540
This type [of] nonsense is not love.

49:13.540 --> 49:22.199
Love is this, that flows, that is love.

49:22.199 --> 49:25.250
And understand the person through this alone.

49:25.250 --> 49:31.340
And all nonsensical loves that people talk
of is not love.

49:31.340 --> 49:37.599
When a person loves you he doesn’t stare
into you.

49:37.599 --> 49:48.240
If somebody stares into you then know he does
not love you – he’s full of a bhoot.

49:48.240 --> 49:56.319
Only when a realised soul is angry he stares
to drive out the badhas.

49:56.319 --> 50:02.159
So, anybody who stares into your eyes and
says, “I have love,” then know that it

50:02.159 --> 50:03.169
is mesmerism.

50:03.169 --> 50:13.130
With discretion you will know this: that anybody
who loves, only a glance is sufficient.

50:13.130 --> 50:25.829
But when it is an anti-Christ activity going
on then you can stare at that person and the

50:25.829 --> 50:27.309
thing increases.

50:27.309 --> 50:34.020
So the idea of love is so absurd.

50:34.020 --> 50:43.730
Love is the one that corrects, that improves,
that elevates, which is blissful.

50:43.730 --> 50:50.359
The relationship is blissful, not hallucinations.

50:50.359 --> 50:58.699
And this blissfulness is only felt through
vibrations not through by hugging or by kissing

50:58.699 --> 51:05.160
or anything, just through vibrations.

51:05.160 --> 51:10.830
Of course, I don’t say you should not hug
each other and you should not kiss each other

51:10.830 --> 51:14.060
– you should, but that’s not the way it
is expressed, it’s through the vibrations.

51:14.060 --> 51:22.179
It’s the pure love of your being which emits
just like light.

51:22.179 --> 51:31.939
Everything should be done in the proper education
of the spiritual love.

51:31.939 --> 51:36.649
We are people of dignity and sobriety.

51:36.649 --> 51:39.649
I have told you this before.

51:39.649 --> 51:43.609
Like, some people have a habit of doing this
in the — no!

51:43.609 --> 51:54.530
If you are sitting in a posture try to sit
for at least an hour – try.

51:54.530 --> 52:01.720
I have sat on one posture for nine hours,
people have seen: didn’t go to bathroom

52:01.720 --> 52:04.449
or eat anything and just sitting there nine
hours.

52:04.449 --> 52:10.490
This is known as baithak is ‘the seat’.

52:10.490 --> 52:15.349
And this baithak has to be great in Sahaja
Yoga.

52:15.349 --> 52:20.899
Try to establish your baithak, that is very
important, so that your attention is brought

52:20.899 --> 52:26.470
in line with your Mooladhara and is straight
there.

52:26.470 --> 52:35.710
Once you do that, practice it, you will find
your spiritual growth would be better.

52:35.710 --> 52:38.939
Walk erect, be straight.

52:38.939 --> 52:43.389
In your talks be straight, kind and gentle.

52:43.389 --> 52:44.720
Need not shout.

52:44.720 --> 52:51.169
No Sahaja Yogi should shout at anybody else,
should play games with another, should not

52:51.169 --> 52:59.000
in any way be angry with each other – is
prohibited.

52:59.000 --> 53:05.010
Should not get into any tantrums of pulling
your hair or doing something like that – is

53:05.010 --> 53:06.100
all nonsensical.

53:06.100 --> 53:08.730
You have to be very, very dignified.

53:08.730 --> 53:19.130
But another foxy method which we employ very
much is to tease and provoke another Sahaja

53:19.130 --> 53:24.619
Yogi, which is even worse, because it hits
you at a subtler point.

53:24.619 --> 53:28.859
Try to be straight, straightforward.

53:28.859 --> 53:35.069
Allow your mind to come to normal when you
talk.

53:35.069 --> 53:44.139
If you have to say something, wait and try
to say something nice, not artificial.

53:44.139 --> 53:50.689
Try to say something from your heart, not
to show off.

53:50.689 --> 53:58.409
In talking also too much quietness is not
good, too much talking is not good.

53:58.409 --> 54:03.349
Some suffer from too much talking and some
do not talk at all.

54:03.349 --> 54:09.250
It’s better to talk whenever it is necessary.

54:09.250 --> 54:15.480
Talk something sweet, no sharpness and sarcasm.

54:15.480 --> 54:18.439
That will spoil your Vishuddhi.

54:18.439 --> 54:22.130
Sarcasm is not allowed in Sahaja Yoga.

54:22.130 --> 54:27.439
You are not to be sarcastic to each other.

54:27.439 --> 54:38.399
Because of a new generation and a new race
that you are, you have to learn that to keep

54:38.399 --> 54:44.530
your vibrations alright you have to have collectivity
within you.

54:44.530 --> 54:50.270
Because you are collectively so much charged
that’s why the Kundalini’s rising.

54:50.270 --> 54:59.699
If your collectivity breaks then it’s a
very, very, very, very wrong thing.

54:59.699 --> 55:07.409
So, try to be nice to each other, kind to
each other, try to understand each other’s

55:07.409 --> 55:08.409
problem.

55:08.409 --> 55:16.869
And never, never complain to me about any
other Sahaja Yogi – till I ask.

55:16.869 --> 55:19.210
It’s prohibited!

55:19.210 --> 55:24.240
If you have to say, tell me about yourself.

55:24.240 --> 55:29.030
Unless and until of course something happens,
then it’s alright, but not against anyone.

55:29.030 --> 55:35.339
Because you will only see the bad points of
the another person and you will not imbibe

55:35.339 --> 55:36.530
the good points.

55:36.530 --> 55:43.470
You have to meditate and think about what
you have to do to become the real prophets

55:43.470 --> 55:47.299
of modern times of Mahayoga.

55:47.299 --> 55:52.439
How you have to dress up, how you have to
behave, how you have to talk, and how you

55:52.439 --> 55:59.169
have to be kindly, that you have to decide.

55:59.169 --> 56:12.380
On this day, I would say that I have talked
a lot and only thing that you have to do is

56:12.380 --> 56:16.970
to imbibe it in you and not on others, that’s
all.

56:16.970 --> 56:27.189
To others you have to be kind, you have to
be sweet, you have to be patient, gentle.

56:27.189 --> 56:32.320
Now, today’s puja has to be very simple
because it is the puja of Guru, who is an

56:32.320 --> 56:33.320
avadhuta.

56:33.320 --> 56:40.639
Avadhuta, as I told you, always teaches you
that the whole thing is futile, all this pattern

56:40.639 --> 56:41.800
is futile.

56:41.800 --> 56:47.409
He even doesn’t talk of any Deities, because
he says, “Alright, let’s worship the Abstract.

56:47.409 --> 56:49.560
Why talk of the Deity?”

56:49.560 --> 56:50.770
Though they will talk of the Mother, alright.

56:50.770 --> 56:53.990
All of them talk of the Mother.

56:53.990 --> 56:58.020
But not of a Deity, because they think if
you talk of the Deity, people will talk more

56:58.020 --> 57:01.369
about the Deity and not about the essence.

57:01.369 --> 57:02.659
But talk is a talk.

57:02.659 --> 57:12.899
Only at this stage you are prophets who are
talking about the Deities, and who are giving

57:12.899 --> 57:18.619
Realisation, and who know the Abstract is
flowing through them.

57:18.619 --> 57:21.040
You are empowered to do that.

57:21.040 --> 57:24.939
You know all about Deities, and you know all
about their mantras and you know how to awaken

57:24.939 --> 57:27.419
them and you know about yourself.

57:27.419 --> 57:29.040
You are all very great.

57:29.040 --> 57:33.299
This may be the last puja now in London.

57:33.299 --> 57:46.339
As a great thing we are worshipping today
Guru Nanaka, that’s me [so] that – may

57:46.339 --> 57:53.730
you become great Guru Nanakas.

57:53.730 --> 57:58.419
All of them were created by Adi Shakti.

57:58.419 --> 58:02.000
All these Gurus were created by her.

58:02.000 --> 58:12.689
And today I say that you all become as great
as Guru Nanak, as great as Moses, as great

58:12.689 --> 58:19.949
as Sai Nath, as great as Nanaka, Janaka, Mohammed.

58:19.949 --> 58:25.590
All [of you] have to become as great as all
these great incarnations.

58:25.590 --> 58:26.800
Just desire!

58:26.800 --> 58:32.270
Have earnestness in you and alertness to achieve
it.

58:32.270 --> 58:36.419
[Only] earnestness is not sufficient, you
have to be alert.

58:36.419 --> 58:43.189
I have already told you how to practice this
alertness.

58:43.189 --> 58:44.299
Try to do it.

58:44.299 --> 58:49.641
I have told Hari certain things, you can ask
him, and I have told other people also, how

58:49.641 --> 58:55.530
to become alert, and how to change your little
habits here and there.

58:55.530 --> 59:00.330
Anything overdoing should be stopped: taking
of too much tea, taking of too much milk,

59:00.330 --> 59:01.760
eating too much, too much reading.

59:01.760 --> 59:05.310
Anything like that, just try to moderate.

59:05.310 --> 59:11.199
Moderation has to be brought in, and you will
be surprised [that] you can master your tongue,

59:11.199 --> 59:12.869
you can master it.

59:12.869 --> 59:21.199
May God bless you all, this day, in the name
of Nanaka I bless you all with that great

59:21.199 --> 59:28.839
Spirit of Master, which you all should become
– the great prophets who are going to change

59:28.839 --> 59:38.540
all the men of God into prophets.

59:38.540 --> 59:44.089
May God bless you!

59:44.089 --> 59:48.909
Today the puja has to be in a different way
if you don’t mind.

59:48.909 --> 59:56.809
Gavin, first of all you do me any favour.

59:56.809 --> 01:00:07.649
I have to tell you that today I want to give
some presents to you all and accordingly I

01:00:07.649 --> 01:00:12.369
have brought some presents for you all.

01:00:12.369 --> 01:00:19.319
Because these are material things, but all
are used by me, all are vibrated, and very

01:00:19.319 --> 01:00:22.230
spontaneously we are going to choose them
all.

01:00:22.230 --> 01:00:26.000
It was within two hours time we have done
some choosing.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:31.770
But in this one has to understand that it’s
all done just to express the Dhanesh Shakti

01:00:31.770 --> 01:00:36.470
of the Mother, just that She loves to give.

01:00:36.470 --> 01:00:42.409
She loves to give.

01:00:42.409 --> 01:00:47.899
Just out of joy that I had in Hampstead, I
felt I should now give you something.

01:00:47.899 --> 01:00:56.699
It’s beautiful there and that’s how we
have today tried to make some arrangement

01:00:56.699 --> 01:00:59.710
for that kind of a thing.

01:00:59.710 --> 01:01:10.649
So just before the puja I wanted to announce
this and then we can have the puja – very

01:01:10.649 --> 01:01:18.720
simple one, because today is a day of simplicity
– complete surrendering.

01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:33.740
Just imagine that these two colours are in
the Void, green and yellow, and if you mix

01:01:33.740 --> 01:01:38.649
them what is the colour you get?

01:01:38.649 --> 01:01:40.360
Green and yellow?

01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:42.629
You get the blue.

01:01:42.629 --> 01:01:47.470
So the green is the Nature.

01:01:47.470 --> 01:01:52.300
So an avadhuta has to become one with the
Nature.

01:01:52.300 --> 01:01:58.929
This is the sign of the Surya nadi, the Sun.

01:01:58.929 --> 01:02:07.780
That means an avadhuta has to be brilliant
like the Sun, brilliant like the Sun, and

01:02:07.780 --> 01:02:12.679
that detached as the Sun is.

01:02:12.679 --> 01:02:14.419
All the detachment must come into him.

01:02:14.419 --> 01:02:18.349
He need not have liver on Sun line.

01:02:18.349 --> 01:02:22.810
He will not have liver if he knows what to
eat and what not to eat.

01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:37.560
Normally all these gurus ate fruits, and they
ate meat, never fats and that’s how they

01:02:37.690 --> 01:02:39.333
kept their liver alright.

01:02:39.536 --> 01:02:49.117
This is, these are the two combinations which
are there in the Void.

01:02:49.117 --> 01:02:53.867
And the combination of these two, when they
combine, it makes a blue.

01:02:53.867 --> 01:02:54.867
What is the blue?

01:02:54.867 --> 01:02:55.867
Is the water.

01:02:55.867 --> 01:02:57.466
So, in the water.

01:02:57.466 --> 01:03:03.006
Now see the Gurus are surrounding the Lakshmi
on the Nabhi.

01:03:03.006 --> 01:03:08.786
On the Nabhi is the Lakshmi is in the centre
and they are surrounding her.

01:03:08.786 --> 01:03:10.796
They are her beauty.

01:03:10.796 --> 01:03:14.726
Without vairAgnya, without ascetic temperament,
the Lakshmi has no meaning.

01:03:14.726 --> 01:03:16.041
It has no meaning.

01:03:16.166 --> 01:03:19.431
It is expressed in giving, is giving.

01:03:19.571 --> 01:03:26.111
That is what it means, that without vairAgnya
the Lakshmi has no meaning.

01:03:26.141 --> 01:03:31.011
Without the feeling of giving Lakshmi has
no meaning.

01:03:31.031 --> 01:03:35.100
Why should Lakshmi come to anyone if they
do not want to give?

01:03:35.100 --> 01:03:40.483
And that is what one has to understand, is
the significance of giving.

01:03:40.553 --> 01:03:46.221
Now, today’s speciality is this, that: though
I am the Lakshmi – alright, I am the Mahalakshmi

01:03:46.221 --> 01:03:52.801
in everything – but I am also Vairagyi,
I am the detached.

01:03:52.801 --> 01:03:56.140
The One who is Nirmama, is beyond.

01:03:56.140 --> 01:03:59.430
Nobody can tie me, nobody can.

01:03:59.430 --> 01:04:01.620
Nothing can bound me.

01:04:01.620 --> 01:04:05.551
I just talk but it has no meaning, I am beyond.

01:04:05.551 --> 01:04:09.451
In the same way, all of you should try to
be beyond.

01:04:09.451 --> 01:04:16.780
So, from the Lakshmi angle I want to give
you something, because Lakshmi looks after

01:04:16.780 --> 01:04:19.780
the saints, and the saints have to be detached.

01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:24.610
That is the way it is going to work out.

01:04:24.670 --> 01:04:32.220
I hope you won’t go back and wear kashayas,
the orange robes (laughter).

01:04:32.220 --> 01:04:38.710
Discretion, discretion, has to mature.

01:04:38.750 --> 01:04:41.170
It’s the maturity of discretion now.

01:04:41.660 --> 01:04:48.560
So, now, for puja today, Chaya, let’s have
a very simple puja, whichever way you like.

01:04:48.596 --> 01:04:51.090
Now, have you got Guru’s names?

01:04:55.244 --> 01:04:56.795
Just see it, their name.

01:04:56.795 --> 01:04:59.315
That I know, Graham.

01:05:17.818 --> 01:05:19.578
Guillemette: Guillemette.

01:05:19.698 --> 01:05:21.938
Shri Mataji: Loudly.

01:05:21.988 --> 01:05:23.838
Guillemette: Guillemette.

01:05:24.408 --> 01:05:26.647
Gavin Brown: Guillemette.

01:05:28.608 --> 01:05:30.728
Shri Mataji: How do you spell?

01:05:30.833 --> 01:05:36.432
Gavin Brown: G-u-i-l-l-e-m-e-t-t-e.

01:05:36.432 --> 01:05:39.782
Shri Mataji: What’s your name, please?

01:05:40.113 --> 01:05:41.973
Loudly.

01:05:41.953 --> 01:05:43.112
Brian: Brian

01:05:43.142 --> 01:05:46.132
Shri Mataji: Brian?

01:05:46.247 --> 01:05:47.712
Rachel: Rachel

01:05:47.768 --> 01:05:49.298
Shri Mataji: Rachel?

01:05:49.892 --> 01:05:51.642
Christopher: Christopher

01:05:51.696 --> 01:05:53.562
Shri Mataji: Christopher?

01:05:53.596 --> 01:05:55.162
Christopher: Nicolas

01:05:55.227 --> 01:05:56.751
Shri Mataji: Nicolas.

01:05:56.787 --> 01:05:59.367
Shri Mataji: What’s your name please?

01:05:59.427 --> 01:06:04.107
Richard: Richard Mother.

01:06:04.157 --> 01:06:05.577
Bernard: Bernard

01:06:05.797 --> 01:06:07.366
Shri Mataji: Bernard.

01:06:07.457 --> 01:06:08.517
What’s your?

01:06:08.587 --> 01:06:12.318
Ian: Ian

01:06:12.338 --> 01:06:17.789
Shri Mataji: Now who else is here?

01:06:17.809 --> 01:06:19.670
Eileen?

01:06:19.670 --> 01:06:21.079
I now here.

01:06:21.144 --> 01:06:26.113
You haven’t washed my hands?

01:06:26.113 --> 01:06:27.273
No, Isodor has.

01:06:27.330 --> 01:06:28.733
Alan you have?

01:06:28.833 --> 01:06:29.983
Never?

01:06:29.983 --> 01:06:33.453
Imagine! (laughter) Alright.

01:06:33.453 --> 01:06:37.774
So let’s have the start.

01:06:56.888 --> 01:07:06.750
Gavin Brown: Gurur Brahma, Gurur Vishnu, Gurur
Devo Maheshwara, Guru Sakshat Parabrahma,

01:07:06.764 --> 01:07:10.160
Shri Mataji Nirmala Ma, Tasmai Guruve namaha.

01:07:10.344 --> 01:07:13.460
Shri Mataji: You all know the meaning of this?

01:07:13.558 --> 01:07:17.360
Gurur Brahma, Gurur Vishnu, Gurur Devo Maheshwara.

01:07:17.619 --> 01:07:31.889
The Guru is the creator, Guru is the protector,
and Guru is the existence and the destroyer.

01:07:31.889 --> 01:07:45.829
Guru is the embodiment of the Parabrahma,
it’s the beyond state.

01:07:45.829 --> 01:07:53.599
And to such a Guru we bow.

01:07:53.599 --> 01:08:07.788
Just a little you can take it on your fingers
you can dip it, you see, and put it on your

01:08:07.788 --> 01:08:08.788
forehead, maybe.

01:08:08.788 --> 01:08:10.089
It’s a water which is now [vibrated].

01:08:10.089 --> 01:08:11.089
Haa!

01:08:11.089 --> 01:08:13.599
You will feel better.

01:08:13.599 --> 01:08:19.849
On the Sahasrara you can put it.

01:08:19.849 --> 01:08:26.548
Just sprinkle it all over you can.

01:08:26.548 --> 01:08:29.418
Let him do.

01:08:29.418 --> 01:08:34.438
Sprinkle it all over.

01:08:50.955 --> 01:08:54.555
Who are these?

01:08:54.625 --> 01:08:58.731
Maria is here.

01:08:58.776 --> 01:09:00.741
Yes.

01:09:00.771 --> 01:09:03.511
Jaldi karo! (hindi: do it quickly)

01:09:03.571 --> 01:09:09.661
Five people together should come forward – alright?

01:09:09.711 --> 01:09:10.910
Come along!

01:09:10.881 --> 01:09:11.751
Five of you.

01:09:11.841 --> 01:09:12.378
Yes.

01:09:12.487 --> 01:09:16.656
Come along!

01:09:43.921 --> 01:09:46.981
Get your finger into there and to my hand.

01:09:47.076 --> 01:09:51.065
Turn it like that, clockwise, with both the
hands.

01:09:51.065 --> 01:09:52.065
Alright.

01:09:52.065 --> 01:09:54.071
Now you rub your own hand.

01:09:54.131 --> 01:09:56.061
Now come along, you do it.

01:09:56.115 --> 01:09:58.065
Come along.

01:09:58.065 --> 01:10:00.024
Rub it.

01:10:00.024 --> 01:10:01.975
It’s good.
