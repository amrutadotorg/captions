00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:10.820
Today is a special day of Guru Nanaka’s
birthday.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:24.810
We have celebrated one Guru puja and, as you
know that, Guru Nanak was also the incarnation

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.460
of the Primordial Master.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.290
The same Spirit came on this Earth.

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:43.459
And he’s the one who tried to re-establish
the work of Mohammed.

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:54.510
Mohammed was the incarnation of the same Spirit
– the Primordial Master.

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.590
He came on this earth to establish the religion.

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:12.420
Islam is the name of that religion, is the
religion of every Sahaja Yogi, of every Christian,

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.449
of every Hindu.

00:01:14.449 --> 00:01:28.610
We all belong to one religion which believes
in expanding our awareness to the new perception

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:36.299
of collectivity.

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:57.190
From human level to the higher level where
you can perceive and manifest the Divine Power.

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:04.629
This is the religion we are following.

00:02:04.629 --> 00:02:13.929
All the religions were established on this
Earth to create the seekers.

00:02:13.929 --> 00:02:15.030
You are the seekers.

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.330
You are the “men of God."

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:24.090
Now, all of you have to become prophets.

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:32.000
And to become prophets today’s Sahaja Yoga
has taken the form of Mahayoga.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.179
All of you have to become prophets.

00:02:37.179 --> 00:02:45.840
The prophets have two special qualities, as
all the prophets had: First of all, they have

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.319
to talk about spiritual education.

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:52.840
All of them did that.

00:02:52.840 --> 00:03:05.170
Mohammed Saheb did it, Raja Janaka did it,
Nanaka did it, Moses did it, Abraham did it.

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:24.000
All of them prophesised and taught you how
to lead yourself in the right path, by the

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:32.760
right action, by leading a right life.

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:41.020
You are going to be the prophets of a little
different nature.

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:59.530
You are prophets, you are Islamic, you are
Jews, you are Parsees, you are all those,

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:18.879
but you are going to become prophets which
are called as “pir’ in Islam, in Hindu

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:21.230
scriptures it’s called as “Atmasakshatkari’,
“Atmajas."

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:39.220
In the way Nanaka has described, he calls
them “par."

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:49.030
But you are endowed with a greater power.

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.960
There’s more power in you.

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:59.590
There they had a bigger propensity.

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:08.460
You have another delicate power by which you
can raise the Kundalini of people.

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:18.870
You are going to be prophets who are going
to make others prophets.

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:26.950
Not only to establish religion but to make
them prophets.

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:32.230
This is the most important thing.

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:42.420
Not just to maintain a static state of righteous
religious good people but to evolve those

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:49.540
seekers, those righteous, good, religious
people into prophets.

00:05:49.540 --> 00:06:01.290
And those prophets whom you will evolve will
also be the same type of prophets but they

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:10.670
will also have this additional power by which
they will also evolve.

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:14.290
That is why it is a Mahayoga.

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:30.640
This is the greatest work in the history of
all spiritual history, that you are the prophets

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:39.170
who are looking after the men of God, and
you are going to transform them into prophets.

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:54.070
To have so many prophets now, for me – you
can’t imagine how happy I must be feeling.

00:06:54.070 --> 00:07:05.720
I have been, sometimes, very, very sharp with
you.

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:09.650
Sometimes I had to goad you.

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:20.590
Sometimes I had to love you, express my love
in that way, that you could feel that Mother

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:24.870
is very kind.

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:31.050
Sometimes I had to be very critical.

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:32.390
Sometimes also angry.

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:37.910
Behind all these aspects of your Mother, She
is nothing but Love.

00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:47.260
Because She loves you so much, and She knows
that you have to be the prophets.

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:54.361
Your calibre may not be of the same level
as those prophets, maybe – you can’t say

00:07:54.361 --> 00:08:01.950
– but definitely you have got special powers.

00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:12.880
Like, you can say, an old Rolls Royce might
be a better car as far as the propensity goes,

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:18.010
or an effect goes, or its behaviour goes – is
a good car.

00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:27.250
But one of the modern ones may have more capacity
to show new acrobats.

00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:36.489
For example it may tumble down, it may go
round the whole place and nothing will happen

00:08:36.489 --> 00:08:37.489
to it.

00:08:37.489 --> 00:08:44.570
Maybe, after some time, you might find a car
which goes half way and comes up a little,

00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:52.630
like a hovercraft and then goes in the air,
and then again drops back.

00:08:52.630 --> 00:09:11.930
So, this new generation of great prophets
are here before me.

00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:21.640
But the big difference between them and you
is this: that none of them had a Mother to

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:35.580
guide them, to love them, to encourage them
when they were depressed, and also to spoil

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:37.410
them.

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:52.580
But you have here a Mother who may apparently
look to be spoiling her children.

00:09:52.580 --> 00:10:03.580
But She is the Master of Masters and She knows
how far to take them and how to correct them.

00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:12.240
Now, for all of you, I have to tell you that
you have to develop your independent discretion.

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:21.130
First of all we have to know that, in this
new realm where you have entered, you have

00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:30.240
to have proper spiritual education, about
which I have given you so many lectures and

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:31.349
things.

00:10:31.349 --> 00:10:38.729
But education doesn’t mean listening to
lectures after Realisation, it means it should

00:10:38.729 --> 00:10:47.890
be imbibed within you, it should penetrate
into your veins, and into your every artery,

00:10:47.890 --> 00:10:50.719
into every cell of your being.

00:10:50.719 --> 00:10:56.570
You have to educate yourself spiritually.

00:10:56.570 --> 00:11:09.240
And Guru Nanaka prophesised, just like William
Blake, that, “The men of God are going to

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:16.599
come during Kali Yuga, and there will be many
prophets who will be transforming prophets,

00:11:16.599 --> 00:11:24.950
who will be transforming people into prophet
state,” [this] he had prophesised.

00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:30.149
They have all prophesised about you!

00:11:30.149 --> 00:11:38.100
Now you have to prophesise (sic) about those
who are going to be prophets.

00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:47.270
But, as it is, you know that we need spiritual
education.

00:11:47.270 --> 00:11:54.300
Because your Guru is a Mother we lack discipline.

00:11:54.300 --> 00:12:00.219
There’s complete freedom for all of you.

00:12:00.219 --> 00:12:05.669
You know that if you go to a guru what kind
of discipline you have to observe!

00:12:05.669 --> 00:12:10.380
I mean the real one, also.

00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:12.730
Unreal, of course.

00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:18.260
But even the real ones, how they test your
attention.

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:24.529
Even for the smallest thing, how they treat
you.

00:12:24.529 --> 00:12:32.969
I’ll give an example of Ravi Shankar, who
was a very great, you know, who is a very

00:12:32.969 --> 00:12:43.810
great sitar player: my father was an advisor
to the Maharaja of Maihar where their guru

00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:47.260
(Allauddin Khan) was living.

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:53.740
This guru was a Muslim but he used to worship
Kali, Mother.

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:56.070
He used to worship Mother!

00:12:56.070 --> 00:12:57.810
And [a] very self disciplined man.

00:12:57.810 --> 00:13:06.350
They say he died at the age of 110 or 120
– Allauddin Khan Saheb.

00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:12.840
And this Ravi Shankar was there.

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:19.770
I saw him as a young man, and this Ali Akbar
(Allauddin Khan’s son) whom you heard.

00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:23.109
They were literally frightened of their guru,
who was a master himself.

00:13:23.109 --> 00:13:28.440
He knew so many of these instruments.

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:37.639
One day my father, whom he used to respect
very much, always used to bow to him, though

00:13:37.639 --> 00:13:43.130
he was a Muslim, they touched feet because
my father was a great connoisseur of music,

00:13:43.130 --> 00:13:50.359
and a supporter of music, and he bowed to
him and he said, “Now, should I play?”

00:13:50.359 --> 00:13:52.810
So he said, “Why not ask your disciple,
this Ravi Shankar, to play?”

00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:57.560
And he said, “Yes, yes, come along, play."

00:13:57.560 --> 00:13:58.560
he said, “Not today sir.

00:13:58.560 --> 00:13:59.960
Please, not today."

00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:02.550
he was very frightened.

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:08.209
Then he said, “Alright, let it be!” he
started playing.

00:14:08.209 --> 00:14:10.060
He used to play on mrudangam.

00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:14.459
Used to play beautiful mrudangam – tremendous!

00:14:14.459 --> 00:14:19.240
I mean, you can’t imagine! he was a Realised-soul,
no doubt.

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:26.539
Then Ravi Shankar, when he finished and he
bowed to my father and he went away.

00:14:26.539 --> 00:14:31.829
Then Ravi Shankar came to my father and he
said, “Don’t ask me to play before my

00:14:31.829 --> 00:14:35.020
guruji!” he lifted his head and said, “See
here.

00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:36.949
Do you see this bump?

00:14:36.949 --> 00:14:44.359
This morning only, he hit me with my sitar,
which he broke, and this is the bump I have

00:14:44.359 --> 00:14:45.359
got!”

00:14:45.359 --> 00:14:47.990
So my father said, “What did you do?”

00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:52.350
he said, “Only one note I played wrong!

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:58.820
That too not wrong but little out of tune,
and on that point he has broken this part

00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:04.030
of my head and I have been in this terrible
pain and he said, “You are not to see any

00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:05.030
doctor!”

00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:06.030
And really there was a big bump.

00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:09.839
He had covered it like that, with the hair.

00:15:09.839 --> 00:15:21.649
(Laughter) That’s why today they have fame
as great masters, because to be masters you

00:15:21.649 --> 00:15:27.789
have to obey your master and to discipline
yourself.

00:15:27.789 --> 00:15:36.960
The spiritual education in Sahaja Yoga, under
Mataji Nirmala Devi, is absolutely left to

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:57.700
your own wisdom: there is no force, there
is no compulsion, there is no organisation.

00:15:57.700 --> 00:16:07.039
It is you who has to feel the joy of your
Spirit and it is you who has to share it with

00:16:07.039 --> 00:16:08.039
others.

00:16:08.039 --> 00:16:16.620
It is you who has to raise the Kundalini of
others.

00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:36.370
Now, today, when we are thinking of a Great
Prophet who, on this Earth, came to establish

00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:42.620
good relationships between Hindus and Muslims.

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:50.479
Imagine, when Mohammed Sahib came he did not
know that he was facing these horrible people

00:16:50.479 --> 00:16:53.810
there who murdered him.

00:16:53.810 --> 00:16:57.209
Actually they murdered him.

00:16:57.209 --> 00:17:00.609
They gave him poison.

00:17:00.609 --> 00:17:12.120
And when he died he said that, “There will
not be any need for any prophet to come in."

00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:17.140
Naturally, if you torture somebody, what else
he’s going to say?

00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:24.370
Also, he felt that whatever he has said, being
such a truth, it will definitely prosper and

00:17:24.370 --> 00:17:28.300
the seed has been sown.

00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:34.350
And he said, “There is no need for another
advent of a master."

00:17:34.350 --> 00:17:46.980
But he found out that there was a big aggression
by the so-called followers of Mohammed, who

00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:54.350
talked of nothing but rehmat (رحمت) – is
compassion.

00:17:54.350 --> 00:18:08.140
Now, before his death he encountered all kinds
of attacks from the negative people.

00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:14.030
Of all of them, the worst of all!

00:18:14.030 --> 00:18:16.220
I think he has suffered the worst.

00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:23.740
He had to move from places to places, hiding
the children away from negative forces, [from]

00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:24.880
tribes to tribes.

00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:40.530
It was a tremendous life, the way he led it.

00:18:40.530 --> 00:18:51.470
And all his life there was nothing but struggle
for existence.

00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:56.550
Only struggle for existence.

00:18:56.550 --> 00:19:13.490
When Nanaka came in, he saw that Hindus and
Muslims were fighting, so he started his theme

00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:27.080
with Kabira, saying that, “Ram and Rahim
are both the same, and how can you differentiate

00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:28.320
between the two?”

00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:34.230
All their theme was like this, of integration
of these two main religions which existed

00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:40.310
in India.

00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:43.170
That time, there was no question of giving
Realisation.

00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:50.100
People were trying to defend their faiths
and fight each other and kill each other.

00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:51.100
Imagine!

00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:53.190
Created by the same Spirit!

00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:54.400
Fighting among themselves!

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:58.740
How silly it must be, and absurd.

00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:03.050
In many places Nanak Saheb has proved that
he was Mohammed.

00:20:03.050 --> 00:20:10.720
Once, he was lying down and his feet were
towards Mecca.

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:13.110
So people said, “How can you put your feet
towards Mecca?”

00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:15.800
He had Muslim disciples and also Hindu disciples.

00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:18.130
He said, “Alright, whichever way you say,
I’ll put my feet."

00:20:18.130 --> 00:20:21.500
He turned round his feet.

00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:24.060
They said, “Still you are towards Mecca."

00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:30.730
He went round and round and round [but] still
they saw him facing Mecca!

00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:43.680
And they could not understand how it was that
he was facing, his feet were towards Mecca,

00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:46.440
that Mecca was at his lotus feet.

00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:49.560
Same with Mohammed.

00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:59.510
Now, all these great incarnations had a special
power over water.

00:20:59.510 --> 00:21:09.820
Because you know, in the stomach we have our
Void and Nabhi Chakra which is made of ocean.

00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:19.920
Ocean represents the incarnation of Adi Guru
– Dattatreya.

00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:24.500
These had great powers over oceans and over
water.

00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:32.620
Like Moses – he crossed the ocean by creating
a road.

00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:39.070
That’s one of the very significant things
which shows that the Void can be crossed with

00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:40.850
the help of the Guru.

00:21:40.850 --> 00:21:48.320
And even Mohammed Saheb had a tremendous power
over ocean.

00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:56.950
Then, Nanaka once put his hand on a rock and
water started coming out of that.

00:21:56.950 --> 00:22:01.950
People were amazed how it started.

00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:04.490
And that’s why it is called as ‘Punja-saheb’.

00:22:04.490 --> 00:22:06.050
‘Punja’ means ‘the hand’.

00:22:06.050 --> 00:22:08.110
‘Punja’ means ‘the five fingers’,
like this.

00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:18.030
What do you say to this, this part, [of the]
hand?

00:22:18.030 --> 00:22:21.890
Hand with five fingers?

00:22:21.890 --> 00:22:23.970
Yogis: This is the palm.

00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:25.530
Shri Mataji: No, no, not the palm!

00:22:25.530 --> 00:22:27.220
The whole thing.

00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:28.220
Like this is a punja.

00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:29.220
‘Hand’.

00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:30.220
Yogis: The hand.

00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:31.220
The open hand.

00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:34.910
Shri Mataji: But hand can be like this (a
fist) you see?

00:22:34.910 --> 00:22:35.910
This way.

00:22:35.910 --> 00:22:37.460
There’s no word, alright.

00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:39.930
So this is ‘punja’ – this is five.

00:22:39.930 --> 00:22:50.960
And ‘punjab’ is five waters, five rivers
– in that area – are called Punjab.

00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:58.140
Now, another thing about these: all these
incarnations had to deal with your attention.

00:22:58.140 --> 00:23:02.850
So they were particular about looking after
your attention.

00:23:02.850 --> 00:23:12.910
And that is why, from the time Moses or Abraham
came in, they talked of no alcoholism.

00:23:12.910 --> 00:23:16.530
All of them.

00:23:16.530 --> 00:23:24.040
It is written very clearly in The Bible that
the strong alcohols, fermented, should not

00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:25.040
be taken.

00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:26.950
If you don’t want to read it, one need not.

00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:32.000
But they think it was Moses who said it and
Christ did not say – so Christians can take

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.980
it, the Moses people should not take it.

00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:39.970
There is no breaking of link between Moses
and Christ.

00:23:39.970 --> 00:23:44.340
They are of the same tree, of the same pattern,
of the same thing.

00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:51.950
But those who want to use Moses for their
own purpose will follow as much as Moses has

00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:57.860
said, and those who want to follow Christ
will follow only as much as Christ has said,

00:23:57.860 --> 00:24:00.690
because it’s very good for them.

00:24:00.690 --> 00:24:07.880
For such useless people Sahaja Yoga has no
place.

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:17.240
We have to understand that all these people
have said for our good and for the maintenance

00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:25.410
of our spiritual life and none of them are
to be criticised or to be challenged but to

00:24:25.410 --> 00:24:29.870
be fully respected as our Guru.

00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:32.310
All of them.

00:24:32.310 --> 00:24:39.670
Whether one belongs to Islam religion or to
the Jew religion or to the Christian religion

00:24:39.670 --> 00:24:41.230
or to the Hindu religion.

00:24:41.230 --> 00:24:48.120
And if they are fanatic they are going against
their guru – it is against their guru.

00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:52.970
So, they were against fanaticism.

00:24:52.970 --> 00:24:54.920
First thing they were against [was] alcoholism.

00:24:54.920 --> 00:25:00.320
That’s the first thing, they thought, because
somehow human beings take to alcoholism very

00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:01.320
fast.

00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:07.360
At the time of Mohammed Saheb, people did
not know how to smoke.

00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:11.670
Then they developed, became modern.

00:25:11.670 --> 00:25:15.540
At the time of Nanaka they started smoking
so he prohibited that.

00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:23.110
But Mohammed Sahib said that, “Anything
that goes against your awareness, any intoxication

00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:34.920
of any kind” – he generally, he gave a
very general instruction, “is against God."

00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:44.510
So, our training, our spiritual education
should be that we cannot be fanatics anymore.

00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:53.220
If you are fanatic anymore, or you are identified
with any one of your old ideas, then beware!

00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:59.360
Be very, very careful!

00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:06.810
You cannot have fanatic ideas anymore if you
want to be a good Sahaja Yogi or a Maha Yogi

00:26:06.810 --> 00:26:15.180
– meaning a person who is a prophet, not
only a prophet, but who is capable of transforming

00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:21.290
others into prophets.

00:26:21.290 --> 00:26:25.990
First is, you have to be away from alcoholism.

00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:28.870
You should be deadly against it.

00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:37.150
Whenever you have a chance you find it that
it is possible for you to say something against

00:26:37.150 --> 00:26:38.150
alcoholism.

00:26:38.150 --> 00:26:42.500
It should be absolutely boycotted.

00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:55.290
Every place, anywhere you meet, it should
be smoking or any kind of intoxication, drugging,

00:26:55.290 --> 00:27:03.330
anything, has to be completely branded as
anti-God, anti-Sahaja Yoga.

00:27:03.330 --> 00:27:08.570
Then, fanaticism of any kind.

00:27:08.570 --> 00:27:10.030
That lingers on.

00:27:10.030 --> 00:27:14.400
This is another very deep misidentification.

00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:17.280
I am aware of it.

00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:26.190
I did not talk of Catholicism till the other
day I went to Portugal, when I had to talk.

00:27:26.190 --> 00:27:28.000
So I said [for the] first time.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:34.400
I never talked about Protestants before, till
I had to talk that they are another mad race

00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:35.400
going round!

00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:38.510
There are 27 churches of this kind.

00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:49.680
None of them, except for we, are really Christians.

00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:58.270
All are nonsensical fanatics: Seventh Day
Adventists and Pentecostals, and this and

00:27:58.270 --> 00:28:00.230
that.

00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:02.550
All are absurd ideas!

00:28:02.550 --> 00:28:06.970
All are playing into the hands of bhoots,
take it from me.

00:28:06.970 --> 00:28:10.060
They have nothing to do with God, they are
anti-God.

00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:18.350
All those who still stick on to all these
churches and to this kind of fanaticism – I

00:28:18.350 --> 00:28:25.730
am saying here of churches because here I
have to talk about churches – should know

00:28:25.730 --> 00:28:29.960
that all these churches have now become the
place of bhoots.

00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:36.730
You’ll go to one church and you’ll rush
to me!

00:28:36.730 --> 00:28:43.990
From my house I see in the night, hosts of
bhoots waiting out of the church.

00:28:43.990 --> 00:28:52.830
(Laughter) I do not know! (laughing) And somehow
it’s happening that, whatever house I decide

00:28:52.830 --> 00:28:53.830
to stay in, there’s a big church in front
of me.

00:28:53.830 --> 00:28:56.930
(Laughter) It may be a Catholic church, may
be a Protestant church.

00:28:56.930 --> 00:29:06.270
And they have seen to it that they make it
really bhootish by making all those who die

00:29:06.270 --> 00:29:10.490
stay in that church.

00:29:10.490 --> 00:29:14.050
They are not Realised people.

00:29:14.050 --> 00:29:19.130
Realised people only should be buried and
all others should be burnt off.

00:29:19.130 --> 00:29:20.130
It’s better.

00:29:20.130 --> 00:29:22.420
At least the bhoots go out of them.

00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:27.630
And they are roaming about in the church,
and you are taking the children down there

00:29:27.630 --> 00:29:29.560
into the cemetery!

00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:35.340
Apart from that wherever there is a anadhikaar
cheshta (अनधिकार चेष्टा

00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:39.350
meaning ‘unauthorised activity’) – when
it is unauthorised – Gods do not exist there.

00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:41.450
They leave the place.

00:29:41.450 --> 00:29:48.590
So, we have to know that we are no more fanatics.

00:29:48.590 --> 00:29:52.560
First and foremost thing is that we cannot
be fanatics.

00:29:52.560 --> 00:30:00.930
Now, training ourselves is very important,
spiritual education is very important.

00:30:00.930 --> 00:30:09.120
But in Sahaja Yoga, as your Mother is a very
kind teacher, but even such a kind teacher

00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:16.680
is not such a help sometimes because all corrections
are left to yourself, and then you commit

00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:21.940
really blunders and then you think, “Why
didn’t Mother tell us?

00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:25.360
Why didn’t She protect us, why didn’t
She correct?”

00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:32.600
But this is the style I have adopted because
in modern times, Sahaja Yoga is working out

00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:35.850
because I do not challenge your ego.

00:30:35.850 --> 00:30:40.970
Otherwise you would have crucified me long
time back.

00:30:40.970 --> 00:30:44.240
So I leave it to you to decide to discipline
yourself.

00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:49.330
It is for you to discipline yourself and understand
yourself.

00:30:49.330 --> 00:30:56.840
Now, the best way to discipline yourself is
to find out, “What’s wrong with me?”

00:30:56.840 --> 00:30:57.840
Not with others.

00:30:57.840 --> 00:30:59.360
We are very good at that.

00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:03.670
I have seen every day there’s some complaint
about somebody coming from someone.

00:31:03.670 --> 00:31:12.650
But there are very few who will say, “This
is wrong with me, Mother, what to do?”

00:31:12.650 --> 00:31:16.740
So just try to find out what is wrong with
you.

00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:19.190
You are like a fort.

00:31:19.190 --> 00:31:24.200
The fort has some sort of a weakness.

00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:32.410
So, the man in charge of the fort – what
do you call him?

00:31:32.410 --> 00:31:39.390
We call kiledaar ( किलेदार ) because
a fort is kila and the gentleman is the owner

00:31:39.390 --> 00:31:41.910
of the kila, is called as kiledaar.

00:31:41.910 --> 00:31:50.800
Now, this kiledaar finds out what are the
weak points of the fort and he sees to it

00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:53.350
that they are all corrected one by one.

00:31:53.350 --> 00:31:57.480
We are just the other way round.

00:31:57.480 --> 00:32:02.500
We know we have weaknesses which we hide and
keep them there as they are.

00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:09.120
Whatever strong points we have that we boast
of and we try to see the weaknesses of others,

00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:16.030
and from these loopholes all these negative
things creep in and suddenly you find that

00:32:16.030 --> 00:32:18.730
you are finished.

00:32:18.730 --> 00:32:25.490
So try to find out what are your weaknesses.

00:32:25.490 --> 00:32:34.240
One of the weaknesses, which is very common
is that we are very materialistic people,

00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:39.770
we are still very materialistic, extremely
materialistic.

00:32:39.770 --> 00:32:47.680
And the materialism is getting subtler and
subtler the subtler we be.

00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:50.180
Try to give up some things.

00:32:50.180 --> 00:33:00.300
Keep a kind of a little balanced attitude,
a little detached attitude, not too many things.

00:33:00.300 --> 00:33:04.710
Few things of value.

00:33:04.710 --> 00:33:06.110
Try to detach yourself.

00:33:06.110 --> 00:33:08.270
I don’t say you become sanyasis.

00:33:08.270 --> 00:33:11.110
That is also another thing against.

00:33:11.110 --> 00:33:14.600
But from inside you detach.

00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:27.030
See, I’m wearing a very nice sari, but from
inside see what is the colour.

00:33:27.030 --> 00:33:28.360
(Laughter)

00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:33.590
From inside you should be detached, not from
outside.

00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:37.730
So that, try to practice this detachment.

00:33:37.730 --> 00:33:41.850
Whatever you want to possess, you just don’t
possess.

00:33:41.850 --> 00:33:45.350
Teach your body, teach your mind: “No!

00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:48.540
You want a shirt?

00:33:48.540 --> 00:33:50.470
No!Nothing doing!”

00:33:50.470 --> 00:33:51.470
You try.

00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:53.370
Train up your body.

00:33:53.370 --> 00:33:58.520
Now some people want comfort, the body wants
comfort.

00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:01.320
Alright, “You want comfort?

00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:07.530
No, I will sleep on the ground and teach you
a lesson!”

00:34:07.530 --> 00:34:10.689
Teach your body a lesson!

00:34:10.689 --> 00:34:14.259
Teach your wants and desires a lesson!

00:34:14.259 --> 00:34:16.719
Let’s see what happens.

00:34:16.719 --> 00:34:22.570
Now, I don’t know why, but in England it
should not be so.

00:34:22.570 --> 00:34:26.790
I mean I expected people absolutely detached
because they have got everything.

00:34:26.790 --> 00:34:31.800
But here it is much more attachment than detachment.

00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:36.179
There is no satisfaction of any kind.

00:34:36.179 --> 00:34:50.949
So, a kind of a detachment must be developed,
to your desires, to your belongings, to your

00:34:50.949 --> 00:34:58.089
possessions and whatever kind of a material
aspect you want to build up.

00:34:58.089 --> 00:35:06.109
I always said that you must not look like
people who are coming from the lunatic asylum,

00:35:06.109 --> 00:35:13.179
that’s true, but you should also not look
like a dandy person, with a flair, a big bow

00:35:13.179 --> 00:35:16.720
here, and a sort of a thing.

00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:18.659
You should be in the centre.

00:35:18.659 --> 00:35:24.070
And how are you in centre?

00:35:24.070 --> 00:35:25.310
When you are detached.

00:35:25.310 --> 00:35:26.860
Then nothing can impress you.

00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:34.189
But that doesn’t mean…some people I’ve
seen that outside they make a show, that they

00:35:34.189 --> 00:35:40.220
are absolutely dishevelled, absolutely in
a very filthy condition, smelling like pigs.

00:35:40.220 --> 00:35:43.960
(Laughter) They think they are going to take
an avatara of Varaha (boar incarnation of

00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:48.899
Shri Vishnu) by smelling like pigs!

00:35:48.899 --> 00:35:56.600
And all sorts of funny things they do in the
name of detachment.

00:35:56.600 --> 00:35:59.149
No – detachment is within.

00:35:59.149 --> 00:36:03.949
Try to practice it.

00:36:03.949 --> 00:36:07.379
That is one of the educations you have to
develop.

00:36:07.379 --> 00:36:09.679
How do you develop that detachment?

00:36:09.679 --> 00:36:13.429
Is by giving things away.

00:36:13.429 --> 00:36:17.629
Not to me, but giving things away to others.

00:36:17.629 --> 00:36:21.699
Say you reach a certain state of – say you
have two suits.

00:36:21.699 --> 00:36:25.150
If you have a third one then give it away.

00:36:25.150 --> 00:36:26.189
Give away things.

00:36:26.189 --> 00:36:34.579
It’s a very good way of developing detachment,
and enjoying the giving away than possessing.

00:36:34.579 --> 00:36:42.440
It’s greater, is much greater, take it from
me, is much greater than possessing.

00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:54.129
Now for you, at this stage, I cannot say,
but maybe after some time, it will become

00:36:54.129 --> 00:37:01.080
that I prophesise that you will become sinless,
absolutely sinless.

00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:04.810
You cannot do sin and whatever you do will
not be sin.

00:37:04.810 --> 00:37:06.990
I am sinless.

00:37:06.990 --> 00:37:13.060
Even if I rob you of all your wealth nobody
can say I have committed sin.

00:37:13.060 --> 00:37:16.270
I am absolutely sinless.

00:37:16.270 --> 00:37:23.480
Even if I kill thousands and thousands of
people nobody would say that I have killed

00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:25.260
because I am sinless.

00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:36.240
But, despite all that state, I do not commit
any so-called sin because I have to lay down

00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:41.720
my life in such a way that you people follow.

00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:47.839
That you should not tomorrow say that, “Mother
did this, She has done this so why not we?”

00:37:47.839 --> 00:37:50.649
That’s why I’m so very particular.

00:37:50.649 --> 00:38:00.560
At the same point I would like to tell you
that today Chaya, in her sweetness, went and

00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:03.169
bought a very expensive sari.

00:38:03.169 --> 00:38:12.240
And she brought with such love and affection
to me, that I had told her just buy me a £10

00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:17.710
worth of a shawl and she couldn’t bear the
idea.

00:38:17.710 --> 00:38:27.790
But she should know [that] for me anything
is valuable that you give to me.

00:38:27.790 --> 00:38:30.649
Nothing expensive is needed.

00:38:30.649 --> 00:38:38.230
Even if you give me the most expensive I have
every right on that.

00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:46.760
But you must understand that if this practice
is continued too much it will create a bad

00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:47.760
public opinion.

00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:54.770
So, at the most, definitely decide that you’ll
give me only two saris, that’s all.

00:38:54.770 --> 00:38:57.599
I don’t need even these two.

00:38:57.599 --> 00:38:58.850
And I can have all of them.

00:38:58.850 --> 00:39:04.640
So, the situation is such that we have to
be very careful about the public opinion,

00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:07.080
and people may start saying tomorrow, “Oh!

00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:09.990
Mother, She wears all expensive saris."

00:39:09.990 --> 00:39:15.030
Let my husband buy for me, he has lots of
money!

00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:18.490
And you can buy me very ordinary things.

00:39:18.490 --> 00:39:22.169
And I told once Modi that, “You buy me khadi
(homespun) saris, that’s the best,” but

00:39:22.169 --> 00:39:23.280
he couldn’t bear it.

00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:24.550
It was too much for him.

00:39:24.550 --> 00:39:30.230
He says that, “Mother, we are middle class
people and we are giving you something middle

00:39:30.230 --> 00:39:31.230
class."

00:39:31.230 --> 00:39:32.230
I said, “Alright."

00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:35.530
So, once for all I told them, “Alright,
you buy some saris."

00:39:35.530 --> 00:39:39.880
And then I bought for them, one of them is
this one, and I don’t know if the whole

00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:41.800
money is paid – most of the money I have
paid.

00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:47.790
But still, you know, there was somebody who
came out with an objection!

00:39:47.790 --> 00:39:55.570
I know you love me very much and you want
to do something for me like that, but I would

00:39:55.570 --> 00:40:03.230
request that try to get things which are sober
and simple for me.

00:40:03.230 --> 00:40:09.819
By God’s Grace, you should know your Mother
is looked after, you don’t have to worry.

00:40:09.819 --> 00:40:20.480
Supposing I was a beggar then you would have
had to spend much more money but that is not

00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:21.480
so.

00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:25.080
And it is not that it is in any way wrong,
on the contrary, it’s a very great thing.

00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:30.040
After all these are going to be in your Mother’s
personal archives and people are going to

00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:35.230
see what saris you people gave me, and they’re
going to be very happy – of course, no doubt

00:40:35.230 --> 00:40:37.930
– and that’s going to be very, very great
for you.

00:40:37.930 --> 00:40:44.340
But, still, where the public is concerned
you be careful and understand that when you

00:40:44.340 --> 00:40:52.010
do anything like that for me, this public
is mad and we have to keep a proper balance.

00:40:52.010 --> 00:41:03.599
Now, about training yourself, as I said, detachment,
then another thing is astuteness – astuteness.

00:41:03.599 --> 00:41:09.869
Try to develop astute habits – astute – specially
for religious work.

00:41:09.869 --> 00:41:16.840
First of all understand that you have to give
some money for Sahaja Yoga work.

00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:18.610
In that you should be astute.

00:41:18.610 --> 00:41:25.130
I was amazed to hear from some people that
for food also you want to have free – that

00:41:25.130 --> 00:41:28.359
sometimes you had food you didn’t pay even
one pound.

00:41:28.359 --> 00:41:30.090
I mean this is absurd.

00:41:30.090 --> 00:41:36.290
If you were beggars is alright, but for Sahaja
Yoga, first of all, it’s not too much.

00:41:36.290 --> 00:41:39.220
But little you have to pay.

00:41:39.220 --> 00:41:41.609
And you should not make your Mother pay for
you.

00:41:41.609 --> 00:41:42.609
It’s wrong.

00:41:42.609 --> 00:41:47.040
I never said this before, but today I’m
telling you.

00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:52.000
Not aesthetically, but spiritually it is wrong
that I should pay for you.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:57.210
It’s alright – I may give you a dinner,
it’s different, I may give you anything,

00:41:57.210 --> 00:42:04.100
it’s different, but that you should not
try to take advantage in any way or exploit

00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:13.619
in any way this Mother of yours, who has got
lots of things other than what you know of,

00:42:13.619 --> 00:42:17.050
which can work out against your spiritual
growth.

00:42:17.050 --> 00:42:20.530
So just don’t do anything like that.

00:42:20.530 --> 00:42:22.970
No exploitation.

00:42:22.970 --> 00:42:25.419
Learn that.

00:42:25.419 --> 00:42:30.270
Those who have done such a thing must decide
that no more like that.

00:42:30.270 --> 00:42:35.689
Now, I’ll tell you a difference between
Indians and you people is this: that an Indian

00:42:35.689 --> 00:42:37.970
would never do that.

00:42:37.970 --> 00:42:43.619
We had one Indian coming here and he was not
such a big Sahaja Yogi, but he used to come

00:42:43.619 --> 00:42:47.820
for his puja, and he would not take money
for his puja and these people had to fight

00:42:47.820 --> 00:42:48.820
with him.

00:42:48.820 --> 00:42:50.629
Ask him, he’s sitting down, he would not
take.

00:42:50.629 --> 00:42:55.349
But how materialistic we are!

00:42:55.349 --> 00:43:00.990
And then, when people mesmerise you then you
buy a Rolls Royce for that person, and here

00:43:00.990 --> 00:43:06.630
a Mother is giving you all the freedom, so
you are exploiting your Mother!

00:43:06.630 --> 00:43:11.330
“I have no job,” all this is wrong.

00:43:11.330 --> 00:43:15.760
You must pay for your food, and must pay where
you have to pay.

00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:20.100
That’s your dharma, that’s your religion,
of every Sahaja Yogi.

00:43:20.100 --> 00:43:26.040
Alright, you need not pay too much, but you
must pay where it has to be paid.

00:43:26.040 --> 00:43:28.980
And never take a parasitic attitude.

00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:33.369
That will kill your growth, will dwarf you.

00:43:33.369 --> 00:43:36.510
I am warning you about it.

00:43:36.510 --> 00:43:37.510
Astuteness.

00:43:37.510 --> 00:43:43.159
For payment, for accounting, for everything,
one has to be extremely astute.

00:43:43.159 --> 00:43:48.689
Like, I’ll tell you, I have seen people
used to come to my house, long time back – I

00:43:48.689 --> 00:43:52.669
shouldn’t say this but [it] used to be so
funny – they would go in the kitchen, take

00:43:52.669 --> 00:43:55.550
out anything, eat anything, walk off anywhere.

00:43:55.550 --> 00:43:57.689
It was amazing!

00:43:57.689 --> 00:43:59.240
Our cooks could not understand.

00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:00.510
Nobody could understand such people.

00:44:00.510 --> 00:44:06.439
Just coming in the house, walking into the
kitchen, taking off whatever they like, eat

00:44:06.439 --> 00:44:07.439
anything.

00:44:07.439 --> 00:44:08.439
Like bounders!

00:44:08.439 --> 00:44:21.000
This training has to come within you where
you must realise and understand that astuteness

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:26.319
towards Sahaja Yoga has to be maintained.

00:44:26.319 --> 00:44:34.609
Like going into the ashram, walking into somebody’s
kitchen, taking out things.

00:44:34.609 --> 00:44:41.520
Using the ashram in a state as if it does
not matter.

00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:42.520
It’s ashram!

00:44:42.520 --> 00:44:44.740
It’s a pure thing.

00:44:44.740 --> 00:44:46.750
You cannot fight in an ashram.

00:44:46.750 --> 00:44:49.439
You cannot talk loudly in an ashram.

00:44:49.439 --> 00:44:52.099
You have to lead a pure life in an ashram.

00:44:52.099 --> 00:44:54.839
You cannot play games with each other.

00:44:54.839 --> 00:44:56.480
You cannot make it dirty.

00:44:56.480 --> 00:45:00.569
You cannot spoil it, otherwise your spiritual
growth won’t come up.

00:45:00.569 --> 00:45:06.179
This is the simplest thing one should know,
is to respect Sahaja Yoga.

00:45:06.179 --> 00:45:09.189
Love without respect has no meaning.

00:45:09.189 --> 00:45:13.869
You have to respect, and respect the place,
respect everything.

00:45:13.869 --> 00:45:18.369
Keep it clean, be astute about it.

00:45:18.369 --> 00:45:21.210
And this is one of the greatest trainings.

00:45:21.210 --> 00:45:27.129
I don’t know how, but to a British mind
it should not be told, because they are known

00:45:27.129 --> 00:45:28.740
for this kind of a training!

00:45:28.740 --> 00:45:40.199
But I don’t know, because now you are saints,
I think, I feel that you have had other kind

00:45:40.199 --> 00:45:45.560
of training before, that you are born as saints.

00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:54.750
Perhaps you have no self-esteem yet, of the
value that should be given to your own character.

00:45:54.750 --> 00:45:59.449
Without that, nobody is going to be impressed
by you.

00:45:59.449 --> 00:46:02.220
Nobody is going to be impressed by you.

00:46:02.220 --> 00:46:04.000
Nobody is going to become a prophet.

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:06.830
You have to first of all impress.

00:46:06.830 --> 00:46:09.890
You have to dress up in such a way that you
impress others.

00:46:09.890 --> 00:46:14.850
It’s a very important thing in Sahaja Yoga.

00:46:14.850 --> 00:46:17.609
You have to talk in such a way that you impress
others.

00:46:17.609 --> 00:46:22.919
Supposing somebody’s very fat, he must reduce,
somebody’s very thin, he must put on.

00:46:22.919 --> 00:46:25.939
He must try to have a body of the centre.

00:46:25.939 --> 00:46:31.050
Should not allow the body to move this way
or that way.

00:46:31.050 --> 00:46:38.679
One has to be in a proper shape, in proper
dress, because you have to impress on others.

00:46:38.679 --> 00:46:43.310
You must know that if the personality is not
impressive how are you going to communicate?

00:46:43.310 --> 00:46:48.829
Because first of all the people see you, those
of you who come to you, see your outside.

00:46:48.829 --> 00:46:52.939
They don’t see your vibrations they see
your outside.

00:46:52.939 --> 00:47:01.199
So, all of you must learn how to dress up
and how to behave towards others, how to appear

00:47:01.199 --> 00:47:07.480
before others, how to talk to others, so that
you become prophets who will do wonders and

00:47:07.480 --> 00:47:15.850
who will transform many, many, many more people
into the same state as you are.

00:47:15.850 --> 00:47:21.339
Now, this training you have to take yourself.

00:47:21.339 --> 00:47:27.179
The another point in training in Sahaja Yoga
is that you have to read.

00:47:27.179 --> 00:47:36.669
There are many people who have not read even
Gregoire’s book, leave alone any other.

00:47:36.669 --> 00:47:44.869
You have to learn certain things like chakras
and centres and mantras and you have to dedicate.

00:47:44.869 --> 00:47:49.772
Even people like Vivekanada’s who never
got Realisation – do you know, these people,

00:47:49.772 --> 00:47:54.399
twelve people – they used to study for fourteen
hours.

00:47:54.399 --> 00:48:03.389
Now you will know what to study, what not
to study, and even if you study wrong things,

00:48:03.389 --> 00:48:04.389
you will know where it is wrong.

00:48:04.389 --> 00:48:05.389
So you have to study.

00:48:05.389 --> 00:48:08.689
For example, there are Jews with us – let
them study Torah and see there where is it,

00:48:08.689 --> 00:48:10.000
Sahaja Yoga, in there written down.

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:11.620
Find it out!

00:48:11.620 --> 00:48:15.329
If you are Christians read the Bible, find
out.

00:48:15.329 --> 00:48:19.800
You should read Gita, you should read Upanishadas,
and you should be masters.

00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:27.179
You’ll find that Sahaj Yoga is such a light
that you will know what it is.

00:48:27.179 --> 00:48:33.669
We have got the Devi’s names and the Sahastranamas:
try to read them and try to understand the

00:48:33.669 --> 00:48:37.540
meaning of that and try to understand what
it means, how far it goes.

00:48:37.540 --> 00:48:43.050
That’s how the depth of your knowledge will
increase and your Sahaja Yoga will tell you

00:48:43.050 --> 00:48:48.699
what is right and what is wrong.

00:48:48.699 --> 00:48:54.559
Now emotionally, some of you have terribly
emotional weaknesses: the idea of ‘love’.

00:48:54.559 --> 00:49:02.050
[About] that I must speak to you because it
has come from a group of people who went into

00:49:02.050 --> 00:49:04.760
another style against the ego-oriented people.

00:49:04.760 --> 00:49:09.370
And they believe that love means hugging each
other, kissing each other.

00:49:09.370 --> 00:49:13.540
This type [of] nonsense is not love.

00:49:13.540 --> 00:49:22.199
Love is this, that flows, that is love.

00:49:22.199 --> 00:49:25.250
And understand the person through this alone.

00:49:25.250 --> 00:49:31.340
And all nonsensical loves that people talk
of is not love.

00:49:31.340 --> 00:49:37.599
When a person loves you he doesn’t stare
into you.

00:49:37.599 --> 00:49:48.240
If somebody stares into you then know he does
not love you – he’s full of a bhoot.

00:49:48.240 --> 00:49:56.319
Only when a realised soul is angry he stares
to drive out the badhas.

00:49:56.319 --> 00:50:02.159
So, anybody who stares into your eyes and
says, “I have love,” then know that it

00:50:02.159 --> 00:50:03.169
is mesmerism.

00:50:03.169 --> 00:50:13.130
With discretion you will know this: that anybody
who loves, only a glance is sufficient.

00:50:13.130 --> 00:50:25.829
But when it is an anti-Christ activity going
on then you can stare at that person and the

00:50:25.829 --> 00:50:27.309
thing increases.

00:50:27.309 --> 00:50:34.020
So the idea of love is so absurd.

00:50:34.020 --> 00:50:43.730
Love is the one that corrects, that improves,
that elevates, which is blissful.

00:50:43.730 --> 00:50:50.359
The relationship is blissful, not hallucinations.

00:50:50.359 --> 00:50:58.699
And this blissfulness is only felt through
vibrations not through by hugging or by kissing

00:50:58.699 --> 00:51:05.160
or anything, just through vibrations.

00:51:05.160 --> 00:51:10.830
Of course, I don’t say you should not hug
each other and you should not kiss each other

00:51:10.830 --> 00:51:14.060
– you should, but that’s not the way it
is expressed, it’s through the vibrations.

00:51:14.060 --> 00:51:22.179
It’s the pure love of your being which emits
just like light.

00:51:22.179 --> 00:51:31.939
Everything should be done in the proper education
of the spiritual love.

00:51:31.939 --> 00:51:36.649
We are people of dignity and sobriety.

00:51:36.649 --> 00:51:39.649
I have told you this before.

00:51:39.649 --> 00:51:43.609
Like, some people have a habit of doing this
in the — no!

00:51:43.609 --> 00:51:54.530
If you are sitting in a posture try to sit
for at least an hour – try.

00:51:54.530 --> 00:52:01.720
I have sat on one posture for nine hours,
people have seen: didn’t go to bathroom

00:52:01.720 --> 00:52:04.449
or eat anything and just sitting there nine
hours.

00:52:04.449 --> 00:52:10.490
This is known as baithak is ‘the seat’.

00:52:10.490 --> 00:52:15.349
And this baithak has to be great in Sahaja
Yoga.

00:52:15.349 --> 00:52:20.899
Try to establish your baithak, that is very
important, so that your attention is brought

00:52:20.899 --> 00:52:26.470
in line with your Mooladhara and is straight
there.

00:52:26.470 --> 00:52:35.710
Once you do that, practice it, you will find
your spiritual growth would be better.

00:52:35.710 --> 00:52:38.939
Walk erect, be straight.

00:52:38.939 --> 00:52:43.389
In your talks be straight, kind and gentle.

00:52:43.389 --> 00:52:44.720
Need not shout.

00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:51.169
No Sahaja Yogi should shout at anybody else,
should play games with another, should not

00:52:51.169 --> 00:52:59.000
in any way be angry with each other – is
prohibited.

00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:05.010
Should not get into any tantrums of pulling
your hair or doing something like that – is

00:53:05.010 --> 00:53:06.100
all nonsensical.

00:53:06.100 --> 00:53:08.730
You have to be very, very dignified.

00:53:08.730 --> 00:53:19.130
But another foxy method which we employ very
much is to tease and provoke another Sahaja

00:53:19.130 --> 00:53:24.619
Yogi, which is even worse, because it hits
you at a subtler point.

00:53:24.619 --> 00:53:28.859
Try to be straight, straightforward.

00:53:28.859 --> 00:53:35.069
Allow your mind to come to normal when you
talk.

00:53:35.069 --> 00:53:44.139
If you have to say something, wait and try
to say something nice, not artificial.

00:53:44.139 --> 00:53:50.689
Try to say something from your heart, not
to show off.

00:53:50.689 --> 00:53:58.409
In talking also too much quietness is not
good, too much talking is not good.

00:53:58.409 --> 00:54:03.349
Some suffer from too much talking and some
do not talk at all.

00:54:03.349 --> 00:54:09.250
It’s better to talk whenever it is necessary.

00:54:09.250 --> 00:54:15.480
Talk something sweet, no sharpness and sarcasm.

00:54:15.480 --> 00:54:18.439
That will spoil your Vishuddhi.

00:54:18.439 --> 00:54:22.130
Sarcasm is not allowed in Sahaja Yoga.

00:54:22.130 --> 00:54:27.439
You are not to be sarcastic to each other.

00:54:27.439 --> 00:54:38.399
Because of a new generation and a new race
that you are, you have to learn that to keep

00:54:38.399 --> 00:54:44.530
your vibrations alright you have to have collectivity
within you.

00:54:44.530 --> 00:54:50.270
Because you are collectively so much charged
that’s why the Kundalini’s rising.

00:54:50.270 --> 00:54:59.699
If your collectivity breaks then it’s a
very, very, very, very wrong thing.

00:54:59.699 --> 00:55:07.409
So, try to be nice to each other, kind to
each other, try to understand each other’s

00:55:07.409 --> 00:55:08.409
problem.

00:55:08.409 --> 00:55:16.869
And never, never complain to me about any
other Sahaja Yogi – till I ask.

00:55:16.869 --> 00:55:19.210
It’s prohibited!

00:55:19.210 --> 00:55:24.240
If you have to say, tell me about yourself.

00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:29.030
Unless and until of course something happens,
then it’s alright, but not against anyone.

00:55:29.030 --> 00:55:35.339
Because you will only see the bad points of
the another person and you will not imbibe

00:55:35.339 --> 00:55:36.530
the good points.

00:55:36.530 --> 00:55:43.470
You have to meditate and think about what
you have to do to become the real prophets

00:55:43.470 --> 00:55:47.299
of modern times of Mahayoga.

00:55:47.299 --> 00:55:52.439
How you have to dress up, how you have to
behave, how you have to talk, and how you

00:55:52.439 --> 00:55:59.169
have to be kindly, that you have to decide.

00:55:59.169 --> 00:56:12.380
On this day, I would say that I have talked
a lot and only thing that you have to do is

00:56:12.380 --> 00:56:16.970
to imbibe it in you and not on others, that’s
all.

00:56:16.970 --> 00:56:27.189
To others you have to be kind, you have to
be sweet, you have to be patient, gentle.

00:56:27.189 --> 00:56:32.320
Now, today’s puja has to be very simple
because it is the puja of Guru, who is an

00:56:32.320 --> 00:56:33.320
avadhuta.

00:56:33.320 --> 00:56:40.639
Avadhuta, as I told you, always teaches you
that the whole thing is futile, all this pattern

00:56:40.639 --> 00:56:41.800
is futile.

00:56:41.800 --> 00:56:47.409
He even doesn’t talk of any Deities, because
he says, “Alright, let’s worship the Abstract.

00:56:47.409 --> 00:56:49.560
Why talk of the Deity?”

00:56:49.560 --> 00:56:50.770
Though they will talk of the Mother, alright.

00:56:50.770 --> 00:56:53.990
All of them talk of the Mother.

00:56:53.990 --> 00:56:58.020
But not of a Deity, because they think if
you talk of the Deity, people will talk more

00:56:58.020 --> 00:57:01.369
about the Deity and not about the essence.

00:57:01.369 --> 00:57:02.659
But talk is a talk.

00:57:02.659 --> 00:57:12.899
Only at this stage you are prophets who are
talking about the Deities, and who are giving

00:57:12.899 --> 00:57:18.619
Realisation, and who know the Abstract is
flowing through them.

00:57:18.619 --> 00:57:21.040
You are empowered to do that.

00:57:21.040 --> 00:57:24.939
You know all about Deities, and you know all
about their mantras and you know how to awaken

00:57:24.939 --> 00:57:27.419
them and you know about yourself.

00:57:27.419 --> 00:57:29.040
You are all very great.

00:57:29.040 --> 00:57:33.299
This may be the last puja now in London.

00:57:33.299 --> 00:57:46.339
As a great thing we are worshipping today
Guru Nanaka, that’s me [so] that – may

00:57:46.339 --> 00:57:53.730
you become great Guru Nanakas.

00:57:53.730 --> 00:57:58.419
All of them were created by Adi Shakti.

00:57:58.419 --> 00:58:02.000
All these Gurus were created by her.

00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:12.689
And today I say that you all become as great
as Guru Nanak, as great as Moses, as great

00:58:12.689 --> 00:58:19.949
as Sai Nath, as great as Nanaka, Janaka, Mohammed.

00:58:19.949 --> 00:58:25.590
All [of you] have to become as great as all
these great incarnations.

00:58:25.590 --> 00:58:26.800
Just desire!

00:58:26.800 --> 00:58:32.270
Have earnestness in you and alertness to achieve
it.

00:58:32.270 --> 00:58:36.419
[Only] earnestness is not sufficient, you
have to be alert.

00:58:36.419 --> 00:58:43.189
I have already told you how to practice this
alertness.

00:58:43.189 --> 00:58:44.299
Try to do it.

00:58:44.299 --> 00:58:49.641
I have told Hari certain things, you can ask
him, and I have told other people also, how

00:58:49.641 --> 00:58:55.530
to become alert, and how to change your little
habits here and there.

00:58:55.530 --> 00:59:00.330
Anything overdoing should be stopped: taking
of too much tea, taking of too much milk,

00:59:00.330 --> 00:59:01.760
eating too much, too much reading.

00:59:01.760 --> 00:59:05.310
Anything like that, just try to moderate.

00:59:05.310 --> 00:59:11.199
Moderation has to be brought in, and you will
be surprised [that] you can master your tongue,

00:59:11.199 --> 00:59:12.869
you can master it.

00:59:12.869 --> 00:59:21.199
May God bless you all, this day, in the name
of Nanaka I bless you all with that great

00:59:21.199 --> 00:59:28.839
Spirit of Master, which you all should become
– the great prophets who are going to change

00:59:28.839 --> 00:59:38.540
all the men of God into prophets.

00:59:38.540 --> 00:59:44.089
May God bless you!

00:59:44.089 --> 00:59:48.909
Today the puja has to be in a different way
if you don’t mind.

00:59:48.909 --> 00:59:56.809
Gavin, first of all you do me any favour.

00:59:56.809 --> 01:00:07.649
I have to tell you that today I want to give
some presents to you all and accordingly I

01:00:07.649 --> 01:00:12.369
have brought some presents for you all.

01:00:12.369 --> 01:00:19.319
Because these are material things, but all
are used by me, all are vibrated, and very

01:00:19.319 --> 01:00:22.230
spontaneously we are going to choose them
all.

01:00:22.230 --> 01:00:26.000
It was within two hours time we have done
some choosing.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:31.770
But in this one has to understand that it’s
all done just to express the Dhanesh Shakti

01:00:31.770 --> 01:00:36.470
of the Mother, just that She loves to give.

01:00:36.470 --> 01:00:42.409
She loves to give.

01:00:42.409 --> 01:00:47.899
Just out of joy that I had in Hampstead, I
felt I should now give you something.

01:00:47.899 --> 01:00:56.699
It’s beautiful there and that’s how we
have today tried to make some arrangement

01:00:56.699 --> 01:00:59.710
for that kind of a thing.

01:00:59.710 --> 01:01:10.649
So just before the puja I wanted to announce
this and then we can have the puja – very

01:01:10.649 --> 01:01:18.720
simple one, because today is a day of simplicity
– complete surrendering.

01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:33.740
Just imagine that these two colours are in
the Void, green and yellow, and if you mix

01:01:33.740 --> 01:01:38.649
them what is the colour you get?

01:01:38.649 --> 01:01:40.360
Green and yellow?

01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:42.629
You get the blue.

01:01:42.629 --> 01:01:47.470
So the green is the Nature.

01:01:47.470 --> 01:01:52.300
So an avadhuta has to become one with the
Nature.

01:01:52.300 --> 01:01:58.929
This is the sign of the Surya nadi, the Sun.

01:01:58.929 --> 01:02:07.780
That means an avadhuta has to be brilliant
like the Sun, brilliant like the Sun, and

01:02:07.780 --> 01:02:12.679
that detached as the Sun is.

01:02:12.679 --> 01:02:14.419
All the detachment must come into him.

01:02:14.419 --> 01:02:18.349
He need not have liver on Sun line.

01:02:18.349 --> 01:02:22.810
He will not have liver if he knows what to
eat and what not to eat.

01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:37.560
Normally all these gurus ate fruits, and they
ate meat, never fats and that’s how they

01:02:37.690 --> 01:02:39.333
kept their liver alright.

01:02:39.536 --> 01:02:49.117
This is, these are the two combinations which
are there in the Void.

01:02:49.117 --> 01:02:53.867
And the combination of these two, when they
combine, it makes a blue.

01:02:53.867 --> 01:02:54.867
What is the blue?

01:02:54.867 --> 01:02:55.867
Is the water.

01:02:55.867 --> 01:02:57.466
So, in the water.

01:02:57.466 --> 01:03:03.006
Now see the Gurus are surrounding the Lakshmi
on the Nabhi.

01:03:03.006 --> 01:03:08.786
On the Nabhi is the Lakshmi is in the centre
and they are surrounding her.

01:03:08.786 --> 01:03:10.796
They are her beauty.

01:03:10.796 --> 01:03:14.726
Without vairAgnya, without ascetic temperament,
the Lakshmi has no meaning.

01:03:14.726 --> 01:03:16.041
It has no meaning.

01:03:16.166 --> 01:03:19.431
It is expressed in giving, is giving.

01:03:19.571 --> 01:03:26.111
That is what it means, that without vairAgnya
the Lakshmi has no meaning.

01:03:26.141 --> 01:03:31.011
Without the feeling of giving Lakshmi has
no meaning.

01:03:31.031 --> 01:03:35.100
Why should Lakshmi come to anyone if they
do not want to give?

01:03:35.100 --> 01:03:40.483
And that is what one has to understand, is
the significance of giving.

01:03:40.553 --> 01:03:46.221
Now, today’s speciality is this, that: though
I am the Lakshmi – alright, I am the Mahalakshmi

01:03:46.221 --> 01:03:52.801
in everything – but I am also Vairagyi,
I am the detached.

01:03:52.801 --> 01:03:56.140
The One who is Nirmama, is beyond.

01:03:56.140 --> 01:03:59.430
Nobody can tie me, nobody can.

01:03:59.430 --> 01:04:01.620
Nothing can bound me.

01:04:01.620 --> 01:04:05.551
I just talk but it has no meaning, I am beyond.

01:04:05.551 --> 01:04:09.451
In the same way, all of you should try to
be beyond.

01:04:09.451 --> 01:04:16.780
So, from the Lakshmi angle I want to give
you something, because Lakshmi looks after

01:04:16.780 --> 01:04:19.780
the saints, and the saints have to be detached.

01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:24.610
That is the way it is going to work out.

01:04:24.670 --> 01:04:32.220
I hope you won’t go back and wear kashayas,
the orange robes (laughter).

01:04:32.220 --> 01:04:38.710
Discretion, discretion, has to mature.

01:04:38.750 --> 01:04:41.170
It’s the maturity of discretion now.

01:04:41.660 --> 01:04:48.560
So, now, for puja today, Chaya, let’s have
a very simple puja, whichever way you like.

01:04:48.596 --> 01:04:51.090
Now, have you got Guru’s names?

01:04:55.244 --> 01:04:56.795
Just see it, their name.

01:04:56.795 --> 01:04:59.315
That I know, Graham.

01:05:17.818 --> 01:05:19.578
Guillemette: Guillemette.

01:05:19.698 --> 01:05:21.938
Shri Mataji: Loudly.

01:05:21.988 --> 01:05:23.838
Guillemette: Guillemette.

01:05:24.408 --> 01:05:26.647
Gavin Brown: Guillemette.

01:05:28.608 --> 01:05:30.728
Shri Mataji: How do you spell?

01:05:30.833 --> 01:05:36.432
Gavin Brown: G-u-i-l-l-e-m-e-t-t-e.

01:05:36.432 --> 01:05:39.782
Shri Mataji: What’s your name, please?

01:05:40.113 --> 01:05:41.973
Loudly.

01:05:41.953 --> 01:05:43.112
Brian: Brian

01:05:43.142 --> 01:05:46.132
Shri Mataji: Brian?

01:05:46.247 --> 01:05:47.712
Rachel: Rachel

01:05:47.768 --> 01:05:49.298
Shri Mataji: Rachel?

01:05:49.892 --> 01:05:51.642
Christopher: Christopher

01:05:51.696 --> 01:05:53.562
Shri Mataji: Christopher?

01:05:53.596 --> 01:05:55.162
Christopher: Nicolas

01:05:55.227 --> 01:05:56.751
Shri Mataji: Nicolas.

01:05:56.787 --> 01:05:59.367
Shri Mataji: What’s your name please?

01:05:59.427 --> 01:06:04.107
Richard: Richard Mother.

01:06:04.157 --> 01:06:05.577
Bernard: Bernard

01:06:05.797 --> 01:06:07.366
Shri Mataji: Bernard.

01:06:07.457 --> 01:06:08.517
What’s your?

01:06:08.587 --> 01:06:12.318
Ian: Ian

01:06:12.338 --> 01:06:17.789
Shri Mataji: Now who else is here?

01:06:17.809 --> 01:06:19.670
Eileen?

01:06:19.670 --> 01:06:21.079
I now here.

01:06:21.144 --> 01:06:26.113
You haven’t washed my hands?

01:06:26.113 --> 01:06:27.273
No, Isodor has.

01:06:27.330 --> 01:06:28.733
Alan you have?

01:06:28.833 --> 01:06:29.983
Never?

01:06:29.983 --> 01:06:33.453
Imagine! (laughter) Alright.

01:06:33.453 --> 01:06:37.774
So let’s have the start.

01:06:56.888 --> 01:07:06.750
Gavin Brown: Gurur Brahma, Gurur Vishnu, Gurur
Devo Maheshwara, Guru Sakshat Parabrahma,

01:07:06.764 --> 01:07:10.160
Shri Mataji Nirmala Ma, Tasmai Guruve namaha.

01:07:10.344 --> 01:07:13.460
Shri Mataji: You all know the meaning of this?

01:07:13.558 --> 01:07:17.360
Gurur Brahma, Gurur Vishnu, Gurur Devo Maheshwara.

01:07:17.619 --> 01:07:31.889
The Guru is the creator, Guru is the protector,
and Guru is the existence and the destroyer.

01:07:31.889 --> 01:07:45.829
Guru is the embodiment of the Parabrahma,
it’s the beyond state.

01:07:45.829 --> 01:07:53.599
And to such a Guru we bow.

01:07:53.599 --> 01:08:07.788
Just a little you can take it on your fingers
you can dip it, you see, and put it on your

01:08:07.788 --> 01:08:08.788
forehead, maybe.

01:08:08.788 --> 01:08:10.089
It’s a water which is now [vibrated].

01:08:10.089 --> 01:08:11.089
Haa!

01:08:11.089 --> 01:08:13.599
You will feel better.

01:08:13.599 --> 01:08:19.849
On the Sahasrara you can put it.

01:08:19.849 --> 01:08:26.548
Just sprinkle it all over you can.

01:08:26.548 --> 01:08:29.418
Let him do.

01:08:29.418 --> 01:08:34.438
Sprinkle it all over.

01:08:50.955 --> 01:08:54.555
Who are these?

01:08:54.625 --> 01:08:58.731
Maria is here.

01:08:58.776 --> 01:09:00.741
Yes.

01:09:00.771 --> 01:09:03.511
Jaldi karo! (hindi: do it quickly)

01:09:03.571 --> 01:09:09.661
Five people together should come forward – alright?

01:09:09.711 --> 01:09:10.910
Come along!

01:09:10.881 --> 01:09:11.751
Five of you.

01:09:11.841 --> 01:09:12.378
Yes.

01:09:12.487 --> 01:09:16.656
Come along!

01:09:43.921 --> 01:09:46.981
Get your finger into there and to my hand.

01:09:47.076 --> 01:09:51.065
Turn it like that, clockwise, with both the
hands.

01:09:51.065 --> 01:09:52.065
Alright.

01:09:52.065 --> 01:09:54.071
Now you rub your own hand.

01:09:54.131 --> 01:09:56.061
Now come along, you do it.

01:09:56.115 --> 01:09:58.065
Come along.

01:09:58.065 --> 01:10:00.024
Rub it.

01:10:00.024 --> 01:10:01.975
It’s good.
