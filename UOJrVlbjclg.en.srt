00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:14,330
Shri Krishna -Virata Puja
“Rise above the Ego to enter Virata’s

2
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:18,029
Kingdom”
September 9, 1999

3
00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:19,890
Cabella, Italia

4
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:28,949
Tonight we are going to worship Shri Krishna
as Virat.

5
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:43,649
First is important to understand the incarnation
of Shri Krishna.

6
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:47,000
Krishna word comes from the word Krishi.

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,250
Krishi means agriculture.

8
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:57,280
He’s sown the seeds of spirituality.

9
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:08,010
And for that, first of all, He had to think,
“Where are we as far as spirituality is

10
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:12,930
concerned, how is the land?”

11
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:23,479
So what had happened at the time of Shri Rama
that He created lots of maryadas and by these

12
00:01:23,479 --> 00:01:29,030
maryadas people started mentally thinking
about it, “I am not supposed to do that,

13
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:30,970
I am not supposed to do this.”

14
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:38,950
It was just a mental binding – it was not
spontaneous, it was not sahaj.

15
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:41,690
As a result people became extremely serious.

16
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:50,750
They wouldn’t talk much and they wouldn’t
laugh; they wouldn’t enjoy anything.

17
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:59,259
So Shri Krishna decided that “First of all
we must remove them from this conditioning.

18
00:01:59,259 --> 00:02:13,010
And this conditioning has to be removed in
such a manner that they enjoy themselves.”

19
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:22,790
Then He found out, there were three suggestions
as far as achieving the goal was concerned.

20
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:35,880
So first one, as He says, is to become a realized
soul, Sthitapragya, to go beyond all temptations,

21
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:47,290
go beyond all ego, go beyond all kinds of
conditioning and to become a Sthitapragya.

22
00:02:47,290 --> 00:03:04,260
Sthitapragya is where he doesn’t feel like
ordinary people attracted towards things,

23
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:10,250
but he’s absolutely detached.

24
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:25,260
And this detached person doesn’t take to
any grievances, jealousies, all these things.

25
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:30,390
That He told.

26
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:35,920
But how to achieve it He never told.

27
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,819
And the second thing He described is that
you must work.

28
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:40,819
You have to work.

29
00:03:40,819 --> 00:03:49,060
After all, you have got all the human tendencies
– is to work.

30
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:57,159
But the fruit of the work, you leave it at
the Lotus Feet of God or you may call the

31
00:03:57,159 --> 00:04:01,030
divine Power.

32
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:07,390
This is another trick of His, because He realized
how human beings were twisted and how they

33
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:08,390
had a ego.

34
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:11,340
If you tell them something, how they’ll
misinterpret it.

35
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:16,560
So He took the other way round, that tell
them something absurd.

36
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:31,770
Now whatever work you do, your ego is intact
and with that ego, you can never give it up

37
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:36,320
at the Lotus Feet of the Divine, then impossible.

38
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:43,110
So He made a impossible situation, that after
some time people will realize that this cannot

39
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:52,620
be done and they’ll give up this idea of
leaving everything at the Lotus Feet of the

40
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,210
Divine.

41
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:59,380
This was the one how He prepared the land.

42
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:06,320
Second thing He said, “Pushpam phalam toyum.

43
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:13,730
Flowers, fruit and water.

44
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,300
Whatever you offer Me, I will take it.

45
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:19,080
I’ll take it.”

46
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:26,260
But when you do that, when you do that you
must have ananya bhakti.

47
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:40,310
Ananya means completely single-minded bhakti,
when there is not the other.

48
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:45,150
This is only possible after realization.

49
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:54,120
Only after realization you can put the fruits
of your work at the Lotus Feet of the Divine.

50
00:05:54,120 --> 00:06:02,400
And only after Self-realization you can have
ananya bhakti – means the devotion which

51
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:07,300
is singular.

52
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:14,340
These absurd conditions He put for human beings
because they were so much complicated.

53
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:18,760
So many people tell Me, “Mother we are doing
ananya bhakti.”

54
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,760
“How?”

55
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:24,470
“Because we are singing on the street, we
are taking the name of God all the time.

56
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:34,530
We are going to Pandharipur, you see, in rags
and for one month we walk singing, singing,

57
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:35,530
singing.”

58
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:43,030
This kind of absurd ideas about bhakti, He
never gave.

59
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:51,720
But it is the way He wanted to neutralize
the absurdities of human beings, that they

60
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,110
thought this was the bhakti.

61
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:55,540
Which is not.

62
00:06:55,540 --> 00:07:01,150
Ananya bhakti is only possible when you are
realized soul, when you are connected with

63
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:06,350
the Divine, when there’s not the other.

64
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:15,580
This is how He tried to make three-way attack
I should (say), on human beings, in a way,

65
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,210
on their stupidity.

66
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:22,960
Because He thought that “If I tell them
directly do like this, do like that, then

67
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:28,290
they’ll say, ‘Of course we did it, and
still we never achieved it.’”

68
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:36,630
In India there’s a big cult, we can call
it – people who go to Pandharipur.

69
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:44,040
For one month they walk in rags, singing the
songs and on the way they go on eating food

70
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,270
at different places.

71
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:51,000
According to them this is ananya bhakti, and
they achieve nothing.

72
00:07:51,000 --> 00:08:00,300
They have become very sick and very tired
and have a very bad old age.

73
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,590
But who can tell them?

74
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:05,050
They are all lost in it.

75
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:14,950
So this is a way one could tackle human beings
to show their stupidity.

76
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:20,900
And so many people come and ask Me, as I told
you, that “How is it we do so much bhakti

77
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:26,330
of Shri Krishna and we have achieved nothing?”

78
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:30,500
So He’s the One who prepared the land for
sowing.

79
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:39,180
We can say He’s the One who was like a very
great agriculturist.

80
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:41,110
So His name was Krishi – Krishna.

81
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:47,870
There are so many things I have told you about
Him: how His name came as Krishna, then as

82
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:56,890
how He was called as Radha, who was Radha,
who was Krishna and all those things.

83
00:08:56,890 --> 00:09:05,630
But when He talked of these things also He
told that you should become Sthitapragya.

84
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:07,900
That is they call as Gyana Yoga.

85
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:10,220
Gyana means knowledge.

86
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:14,210
So, you should get absolute knowledge.

87
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:16,220
That He didn’t say how.

88
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:20,620
That you know, what is absolute knowledge,
which you can feel it on your finger tips

89
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:26,820
in Sahaja Yoga.

90
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:32,800
Another thing is, His specialty was to create
discretion in people.

91
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:39,360
He thought by doing all these things in a
stupid manner, they might develop a discretion

92
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,010
to know that this is not the way you can achieve
anything.

93
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:45,370
You have to get your Self-realization.

94
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:48,550
Discretion was very important.

95
00:09:48,550 --> 00:10:01,080
At this juncture, when we are facing a sort
of a challenge of this new millennium – that

96
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:06,220
the whole world is going to be destroyed and
all those things people are talking – it

97
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:17,720
is really very important to know through discretion
what is good and what is bad.

98
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:23,760
One may talk of something as very good, something
as very bad.

99
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,722
But the divine Discretion is very, very different.

100
00:10:28,722 --> 00:10:32,820
Very different and which acts by Itself.

101
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:39,120
Once you are in the realm of divine Discretion
you cannot commit mistakes – even if you

102
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,120
want to do it.

103
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,690
I’ll give you My example.

104
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:52,320
We went to buy a house and the fellow was,
you see, like a beggar he came.

105
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,110
He said, “We have nothing.

106
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:55,650
We have no food.

107
00:10:55,650 --> 00:11:00,790
They have taken away all our things and we
are just absolutely starving.”

108
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:12,490
When they said that, when he said that “We
are starving, we have nothing,” so I felt

109
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:13,490
pity for him.

110
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:15,390
I said, “All right, increase the price.”

111
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:17,530
First we increased the price.

112
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:20,900
Still he was saying, “No, no give us more.”

113
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,580
Still we increased the price.

114
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:24,930
I told My husband, “You increase the price.”

115
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:28,250
Though reluctantly, he increased the price.

116
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,900
Third time again we increased the price.

117
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:35,850
Then he said, “No, we’ll have something
more than that, a little more.”

118
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:42,440
Immediately you see, this Discretion worked
and I said, “These are hypocrites.”

119
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:47,460
I just left them and sat in the car – at
the right moment.

120
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:52,000
That was not such a good proposition or anything.

121
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:58,910
But I could see they, I’m buying it out
of My pity; you may call it compassion.

122
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:05,240
But above the compassion was this Discretion,
which said, “Nothing doing, You better get

123
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,710
out of it.”

124
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:13,420
So this divine Discretion is a very, very
important thing, which we should see how it

125
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:17,870
works and should be satisfied with it.

126
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:23,980
Not to feel bad, that you have missed a chance
or anything, but you must feel very happy

127
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:31,560
that this thing has happened and that your
divine discretion has taken on.

128
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:38,570
So sometimes it appears that, in that divine
discretion you may do something wrong, you

129
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:39,570
have done something wrong.

130
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:45,210
But if it is divine, ultimately it will turn
out to be very good.

131
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:50,190
I gave you a very basic example.

132
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:59,010
But that is also very true when you practice
Sahaja Yoga.

133
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:08,620
The discretion of divine Discretion is extremely
important to play a very great part in our

134
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:18,040
lives, because this divine Discretion gives
us the real joy of our being, of our self,

135
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:21,070
of Sahaja Yoga.

136
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:28,480
So the third point was for Him to make people
joyous and happy.

137
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:35,990
But with all these maryadas of Shri Rama,
He didn’t know how to do it.

138
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:43,839
So to give people joy He said, “All right,
let us dance, let us sing, let us play Holi,

139
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:52,350
all sorts of things,” and with that He really
originated many things which were sort of

140
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:54,220
not serious.

141
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:58,480
May look frivolous, but in that there was
joy expressing.

142
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:08,171
All that He did to give them a full idea as
for a Sahaja yogi or for a, you can say, for

143
00:14:08,171 --> 00:14:14,840
a self realized soul, what should be the attitude
towards everything.

144
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:24,250
But it is not that you have to do it, but
it just works out, it is like that, that in

145
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:29,020
the state of Sahaj, you enjoy everything.

146
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:31,020
Enjoyment.

147
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:38,900
And that is what His idea was, to create a
sense of joy among people.

148
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:43,810
Many people – there are lots of critics
– have criticized this part of His life.

149
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:47,710
According to them, religion means you should
become just old.

150
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:53,700
At the age of twenty years you should become
an old man of eighty years – something like

151
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:58,640
that, funny ideas of religious achievement.

152
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:04,510
But He talked of joy and He never talked of
renunciation.

153
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:13,000
He never talked that “You give up your family,
you give up your children, you give up everything,”

154
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,460
never, never.

155
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:19,560
He said, “You must enjoy, enjoy with detachment.”

156
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:24,980
For people it is very difficult to understand
how can it be it is without detachment.

157
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:28,800
With attachment you can never enjoy.

158
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:35,210
If you are attached to something, you cannot
enjoy anything in a full way.

159
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:38,339
Like, supposing you are attached to your child.

160
00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:41,280
Very simple thing, you are attached to your
child.

161
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:47,020
You’re attached to your child, then you
will be bothered about things which should

162
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:50,770
not be there, which will not give joy to the
child either.

163
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:58,150
You’ll not allow your child, say, to go
out or to talk to people, whatever it is – all

164
00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:00,990
kinds of restrictions you will put.

165
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:09,630
But if you have really the divine discretion,
then you will know with whom he should talk,

166
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:18,170
where he should go, what he should enjoy and
you will see that he enjoys life.

167
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:26,450
Any attachment with anything doesn’t give
you the full view of that person, of that

168
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:28,180
thing.

169
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:38,210
If you are detached, then you can see it,
say, from above … above him, above the thing.

170
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:42,480
If you are detached, you become thoughtlessly
aware, also.

171
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,070
As I said, now, see the carpets are there.

172
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:49,450
They are very, very beautiful carpets.

173
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:55,410
Now if they are here, if they are Mine, I’ll
be worried, I’ll be all the time worried

174
00:16:55,410 --> 00:17:02,680
because I am attached – that these carpets
should not be spoilt, something will go wrong.

175
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:06,980
But if I’m not attached, I’ll look at
those carpets and what do I see?

176
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:08,240
The joy.

177
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:13,480
The joy that is put in by the artist who has
made them.

178
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:21,750
And that joy really tries to reflect in Me
also.

179
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,709
That joy comes in Me.

180
00:17:24,709 --> 00:17:34,090
So to have anything, attachment to anything,
there will be joy … I should say there’ll

181
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:37,650
be happiness but not joy.

182
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:46,330
Because joy is single and happiness is double
– happiness and unhappiness.

183
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:51,130
So even if I try to enjoy something, I’ll
think, “Oh, still there, this, this point

184
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:52,770
is there.”

185
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:55,730
But joy is all pervading.

186
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:59,230
It has no boundaries.

187
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:04,220
And you just get dissolved, you get dissolved
in the ocean of joy.

188
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:11,880
That was what Shri Krishna’s idea was, that
cut out these maryadas.

189
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:18,030
Nowadays we see the maryadas of so many things
are really useless.

190
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:23,340
For example, you have discovered the maryadas
of religion.

191
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:27,510
See when they live in maryadas then what happens?

192
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:39,059
They sort of coggle it or they have all kinds
of germination inside like the pond, which

193
00:18:39,059 --> 00:18:44,880
is absolutely bound, it is not flowing like
river.

194
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:56,110
So like that, you see, it becomes a kind of
a closed mind with these maryadas.

195
00:18:56,110 --> 00:19:03,440
And when you have this maryadas, you start
thinking, “Whether I should do it or not;

196
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,130
whether I’ll enjoy it or not.”

197
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:11,080
With these maryadas only, you kill the joy.

198
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:17,180
Now we have other maryadas about, say, we
have country … as I said about the religion.

199
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:24,050
Now many people who love to come to Sahaj
Yoga, but because they have maryadas of silly

200
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:28,200
things of their religion, they cannot come.

201
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:32,080
They think, “This is our religion,” while
they don’t understand.

202
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:39,480
Falsehood becomes the maryadas and they don’t
understand that what is the maryada actually

203
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:42,590
made by the religion also.

204
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:45,150
You see now in Islam what is happening is.

205
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:53,460
With these maryadas, they want to have another
country, this thing, that thing.

206
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:56,920
In other Christian religion also same thing
happening.

207
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,580
Also in Hindu religion.

208
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:05,309
All these maryadas are really stagnating them
completely, and they are getting crushed into

209
00:20:05,309 --> 00:20:06,429
it.

210
00:20:06,429 --> 00:20:09,790
There’s no discretion.

211
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:13,470
Because they have said it, they do it.

212
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:20,160
They are so much blind-folded about it, that
they cannot see what is right and what is

213
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,160
wrong.

214
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:26,850
But after Sahaj, you can see, you can laugh
at them and you can see.

215
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:32,220
Then we have social maryadas.

216
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:39,330
Social maryadas are there which are sometimes,
when abandoned can become very horrid also.

217
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:46,660
Like in the West now, the women think that
the less dress they wear, the more beautiful

218
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:47,660
they are.

219
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:50,030
This is a new thing they have started.

220
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:52,130
Now this absurd.

221
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:59,640
If you see the discretion behind is very simple:
that we have been animals and now we don’t

222
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:05,200
want to have any clothes because we were animals.

223
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:11,600
Is a animal heritage that if … that’s
why so many women do not want to wear full

224
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,600
dresses.

225
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,240
It’s just animal behavior.

226
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:22,170
So the maryada of – good maryadas also people
can give up saying that “We don’t want

227
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:23,170
any maryadas.

228
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:25,740
We are free; we can do whatever we like.”

229
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:30,310
But in that freedom what do you achieve?

230
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:37,620
Your animal instinct works in that freedom
and you think you are a very free personality.

231
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:40,270
Then we have maryadas of our country.

232
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:44,210
God has not made different, different countries
at all.

233
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:48,790
Nor it is true there are different countries,
but variety is there.

234
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:53,010
Variety of people, variety of places is there.

235
00:21:53,010 --> 00:22:01,250
These varieties must be accepted as something
very artistic and one should not get ruined

236
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:08,320
and confused with those ideas that “We are
Americans, we are Indians, we are this and

237
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,480
we are that.”

238
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,480
You’re not.

239
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:15,940
Now you can know after Sahaja Yoga, that you
are all Sahaja yogis and you don’t belong

240
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:18,179
to any country as such.

241
00:22:18,179 --> 00:22:21,549
The country may belong to you, but you don’t
belong to the country.

242
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:30,070
I mean the work is today to understand that
if you really want to care for all these countries

243
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:38,440
and all that, then you must do some work – work
of Sahaja Yoga so that people get rid of these

244
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:44,130
silly ideas of fighting for territory, for
this, for that.

245
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:49,720
All over the world there’s going on, “We
want this land; we want that land.”

246
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:53,400
Land belongs to God, not to human beings.

247
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,929
And what is the use of fighting for land?

248
00:22:55,929 --> 00:22:57,720
I don’t understand.

249
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:00,800
But this confusion is there and illusion is
there.

250
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:06,140
And people work out on this confusion and
illusion to such an extent that they ruin

251
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:08,620
their lives, the lives of their children.

252
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:16,620
So many people are lost, so many people are
in the lunatic asylum, I should say, because

253
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:20,540
they end up in some sort of a refugee camp.

254
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:25,030
They are having a good house, nicely living
there.

255
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:27,350
Then you become a refugee.

256
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:28,850
Why?

257
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:36,930
Because they believe that they can have their
own land, they can have their own place and

258
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:39,020
they should live there.

259
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:45,570
This idea comes, I think, from some stupid
leaders who want to have for themselves these

260
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:48,910
lands and that’s how people fight for land.

261
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:56,011
There’s no need to fight for land or fight
for your country or fight for this or fight

262
00:23:56,011 --> 00:23:57,280
for that.

263
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:04,429
But the situation is such that unless and
until you fight, you cannot get to the truth.

264
00:24:04,429 --> 00:24:12,010
And that’s why if you remember that Shri
Krishna told Arjuna that “You fight.

265
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:13,010
Fight.

266
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:15,059
You have to fight, that’s your work.

267
00:24:15,059 --> 00:24:21,080
You have to fight these people, because they
are the people who do not live with dharma.

268
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:25,100
They are adharmis, so you have to fight.”

269
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:33,309
And that is how his fighting was so much justified,
because after fighting the war they got back

270
00:24:33,309 --> 00:24:35,080
what they deserved.

271
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:43,080
They were deceived, and this is what Shri
Krishna said that “You should not by any

272
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:52,510
chance become a slave of these people, but
you fight it back.”

273
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:57,610
So fighting also is justified in the divine
discretion.

274
00:24:57,610 --> 00:25:03,429
Is again the divine discretion where you have
to fight because you don’t want to be a

275
00:25:03,429 --> 00:25:04,480
slave.

276
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,929
If you are a slave, you are no good.

277
00:25:06,929 --> 00:25:08,840
So for that you can fight.

278
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:17,120
But when people start fighting for separation
of a territory, is not correct.

279
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:22,200
On the contrary, one should never think of
separating from the main lands.

280
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:26,179
Because it creates lots of problems.

281
00:25:26,179 --> 00:25:29,970
But now we believe in the global religion.

282
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:32,790
We believe in the global territory.

283
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:35,110
We don’t have to ask for anything.

284
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:38,690
Anywhere you go, you are the citizen of that
place.

285
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:44,240
Anybody who wants to go to Russia ever, the
whole Russians will be with you.

286
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,220
You go to America, they’ll be with you.

287
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:53,070
That’s how because all these are ideas of
human beings, and if the human beings get

288
00:25:53,070 --> 00:26:01,470
transformed there will be no problem of any
war or any territory to be achieved.

289
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:08,960
This was the divine Discretion of Shri Krishna,
which is instilled within us.

290
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:19,720
As you know that this is a part and parcel
of the Vishuddhi Chakra, where Shri Krishna

291
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:29,740
resides; but when He rises to your Sahasrara,
when He rises to that level, then He becomes

292
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:32,670
Virata.

293
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:45,780
So Virata’s Chakra is placed in the head,
here above the Agnya, and this Virat is the

294
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:53,130
form of Shri Krishna who has risen above the
Agnya.

295
00:26:53,130 --> 00:27:02,070
When you are risen above the Agnya, you become
a part and parcel of Virata’s land, we can

296
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:03,480
say.

297
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:12,200
Because, unless and until you are above your
ego, you are still involved with yourself

298
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:15,970
and with wrong ideas of maryadas.

299
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:22,980
But when you rise above that and you become
the Virat, the great, then you are in the

300
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:25,410
land of Virata.

301
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:28,450
And Virata’s powers are tremendous.

302
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:32,850
Has been seen by Arjuna – the form of Virat.

303
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:39,750
The power of Virat becomes so tremendous that
it acts globally.

304
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:52,730
It acts in such a manner that you sit here
and anywhere it can act.

305
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:53,770
You have seen that now.

306
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:57,730
Many a times people say, “Mother it’s
a miracle.

307
00:27:57,730 --> 00:28:05,299
My mother was sick and she was not here and
I just prayed and she got all right.”

308
00:28:05,299 --> 00:28:09,270
This is all the power of Virat.

309
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:17,850
The power of Virata is that it can penetrate
into the subtle side of human beings in such

310
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:21,780
a manner that everything we are connected
with.

311
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:24,470
We are not separate.

312
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:26,900
And every drop is connected with the ocean.

313
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:30,950
We are connected with the whole universe.

314
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:42,721
And when you become a citizens, I should say,
of Virat, then all the things with which you

315
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:54,250
are connected also get your vibrations, your
ideas, your ambitions.

316
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:59,590
Everything passes through that and it works
– it works.

317
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:04,590
You have seen how many miracles have taken
place in your lives.

318
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:08,500
It is the Virata Shakti that works.

319
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:18,190
Now for that we have to know how to do worship
of Virata.

320
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:26,260
First of all you have to rise above your ego
– very important.

321
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:29,299
Otherwise how can you worship?

322
00:29:29,299 --> 00:29:39,679
There is your ego standing in between and
how can you rise up to the point of Virat?

323
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:42,900
You have to pass through that.

324
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:50,690
Once you are above your ego, you enter into
the kingdom of Virata.

325
00:29:50,690 --> 00:30:00,130
There the King is the Virat and you are the
subject who are looked after completely by

326
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:03,740
Virata Shakti, by the power of Virata.

327
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:10,970
But at that stage you become really a universal
personality, in a way, because whatever are

328
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:18,400
problems universally – now not necessarily
that they should be attached to you or connected

329
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,270
to you.

330
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:22,600
Supposing a person is of that level.

331
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:30,740
Now there may be a war in some other country
– it can stop.

332
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:35,870
Somebody who is being oppressed can win over.

333
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:39,060
Anywhere your compassion moves it works out.

334
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:42,660
Whenever your attention will go, it will work
out.

335
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:47,550
And sometimes you are surprised as to how
it works, “Mother, how these things work

336
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:48,550
out?

337
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:53,320
How coincidences … how these coincidences
have taken place?”

338
00:30:53,320 --> 00:31:01,340
Only thing is you have crossed that state
of your ego and have gone into the state of

339
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:10,049
Virat, which is a very important thing to
do – is to enter into the area of Virata.

340
00:31:10,049 --> 00:31:12,419
Then you don’t think, “This is your country.

341
00:31:12,419 --> 00:31:14,799
This belongs to you, that belongs to you.”

342
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:17,630
This belonging business finishes off.

343
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:19,900
Then you belong to Virat.

344
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:28,250
And He uses you for His own purpose in the
sense that when your whole thinking is different

345
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:33,590
– becomes global thinking, then He acts.

346
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:35,970
And then His powers are many-fold.

347
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:43,419
And Krishna’s power is that He uses a conch
to call people.

348
00:31:43,419 --> 00:31:46,799
I have given conches to all the leaders.

349
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:52,470
So we have to now announce and call people.

350
00:31:52,470 --> 00:32:00,419
But at the level of Virat, you don’t have
to do all that.

351
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:08,560
At the level of Virat it just – people see,
they’ll know.

352
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:13,590
Just they will watch you and they will know.

353
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:20,490
Just they will think you are human beings
and you are so sweet, so good, just like gems

354
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:22,050
shining all the time.

355
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:25,280
So, they’ll be impressed.

356
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,720
This comes through the Virata’s blessing.

357
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:36,000
When you become that, then you forget about
other things like you have big positions or

358
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:43,080
anything, you come from a very rich family
or that – all these nonsensical things which

359
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:45,590
are actually not true.

360
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:52,179
And all these things on which you want to
exist are no more.

361
00:32:52,179 --> 00:33:02,640
People like to show off their wealth, some
people like to be very sort of demonstrative

362
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:08,030
of what they think they are.

363
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:16,400
But in the case of a person who rises above
his ego, and he’s a part and parcel of that

364
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:23,440
Virata shakti, enters into the kingdom of
Virata, he knows he is very small.

365
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:30,980
He is very small compared to that and he just
dissolves into that Shakti.

366
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:34,559
And this should happen to us that we should
humble down.

367
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:44,781
We should humble down and know that our powers,
whatever we have, if they give us ego, we

368
00:33:44,781 --> 00:33:46,600
should get rid of it.

369
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,600
We should not have that ego.

370
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:56,730
We should get rid of it and we should actually
achieve that state where you can be called

371
00:33:56,730 --> 00:33:58,980
as citizens of the Virata’s Power.

372
00:33:58,980 --> 00:33:59,980
May God bless you all.

373
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:00,980
Now when you are entering into the kingdom
of Virata, you have to be like children.

374
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:01,980
You are children there.

375
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:02,980
As children you enter.

376
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:03,980
As Christ has said, “When you enter into
the Kingdom of God you have to be like children.”

377
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:04,980
And that’s what you have to be today, all
of you to be innocent like children.

378
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:04,987
You have to be innocent like children.
