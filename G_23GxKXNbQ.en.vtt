00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:03.150
Interviewer: Ladies and gentlemen, good evening.

00:00:03.175 --> 00:00:06.436
Seventy countries all over the world know about Sahaja Yoga.

00:00:12.845 --> 00:00:15.065
Ladies and gentlemen, good evening.

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:18.277
Seventy countries all over the world know about Sahaja Yoga.

00:00:18.302 --> 00:00:21.305
And in them, there are centers of Sahaja Yoga.

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.503
Today, we have the opportunity to speak with the founder of Sahaja Yoga,

00:00:26.528 --> 00:00:29.500
Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi.

00:00:29.525 --> 00:00:33.845
First of all, thank you very much for giving us this interview.

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.450
Translator: Thank you very much for giving us this interview.

00:00:36.475 --> 00:00:37.405
Loudly.

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.714
Translator: Thank you very much for giving us this interview.

00:00:41.836 --> 00:00:48.590
Interviewer: First question is, what is Sahaja Yoga?

00:00:48.943 --> 00:00:51.843
Translator: What is Sahaja Yoga?

00:00:53.003 --> 00:01:00.989
Sahaja Yoga is, you can translate it as a spontaneous union with

00:01:01.014 --> 00:01:05.435
with the All-Pervading Divine Power.

00:01:20.885 --> 00:01:24.865
Translator: To which kind of people would you think that addresses Sahaja Yoga?

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.737
Which is the audience of Sahaja Yoga, you could say?

00:01:28.762 --> 00:01:31.714
All of them who are seeking the truth.

00:01:45.125 --> 00:01:49.565
Translator: How Sahaja Yoga can help a human being and in which levels,

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.847
in which…

00:01:51.872 --> 00:01:57.560
I mean, it's the last breakthrough of our evolution, which takes place

00:01:57.585 --> 00:02:00.805
because there's a power within us on the triangular bone.

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.633
Actually, surprisingly, Greeks knew about it.

00:02:03.658 --> 00:02:06.445
Greeks called it a sacrum, means a sacred bone.

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.780
So, they were aware of it. It shows that.

00:02:08.805 --> 00:02:11.924
But I don't know, everything is lost now in Greece.

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:15.571
So, we can't say, but they call this bone as sacrum.

00:02:15.596 --> 00:02:20.759
And in that triangular bone resides a power called, we call it Kundalini,

00:02:20.784 --> 00:02:23.645
 because it is in coils, three and a half coils.

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:30.784
And this power awakens and passes through six centers of our body.

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:37.625
These six centers in our body are made out of parasympathetic nervous system

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:45.240
and this power enlightens it, integrates them and gives them

00:02:45.272 --> 00:02:49.385
special energy of awareness.

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:36.149
Can I say something?

00:03:36.174 --> 00:03:40.854
I don't like to talk to Shri Mataji at the look camera.

00:03:41.547 --> 00:03:43.565
Cameraman: Ah, so?
How you want?

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:44.994
Tell me how you want.

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:46.973
She doesn't like to talk to you.

00:03:46.998 --> 00:03:50.853
Yes, yes, I don't feel nice.

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:54.825
But, so I have to go more.

00:03:54.850 --> 00:04:00.596
Okay, okay, now we have everybody.

00:04:02.976 --> 00:04:04.500
Wait.

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:10.517
Okay.

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:21.000
Translator: So, we can say that Sahaja Yoga has, there is a relation

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.395
between Sahaja Yoga and ancient Greece.

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:24.762
Of course.

00:04:32.627 --> 00:04:37.675
When could we say that Sahaja Yoga starts in the world?

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.575
In my life.

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.400
It started in 1970.

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.375
What made you start Sahaja Yoga?

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.095
What made you create Sahaja Yoga?

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:02.139
I won't say that because in our country people knew,

00:05:02.164 --> 00:05:05.625
 in many countries they knew, in your country also they knew

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:08.783
 that there is this power and it is to be awakened

00:05:08.808 --> 00:05:12.295
and they used to do it one person to one person normally.

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:17.455
Like that we have Sufis also in Turkey and in other places.

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:21.446
But actually what I did was to find out a way and method

00:05:21.471 --> 00:05:25.280
 by which we can give amass Realization.

00:05:25.305 --> 00:05:27.135
That's my finding.

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:57.975
Translator: What is the difference between Sahaja Yoga and the other kinds of Yoga?

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.946
I mean, there are so many Yogas they talk about, I don't know.

00:06:01.971 --> 00:06:05.315
But it's a, it's very superficial and it's just a kind of yoga.

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:07.146
Most mental, most of them are.

00:06:07.171 --> 00:06:12.735
Even Raja Yoga that they talk of is the same, that happens within yourself.

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:20.275
When Kundalini starts rising, then all these things they talk of happens within yourself.

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:22.860
You can't do it from outside.

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:51.115
Translator: So when someone practices Sahaja Yoga, changes also, it makes him change.

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:54.780
Because these six centers I told you about are responsible

00:06:54.805 --> 00:06:58.695
for our physical, mental, emotional and spiritual being.

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:02.220
And once they get enlightened, definitely there's a change within us.

00:07:02.245 --> 00:07:05.096
We become a transformed personality.

00:07:38.354 --> 00:07:42.096
Official religion in Greece  is  the Greek Orthodox Church

00:07:42.121 --> 00:07:46.040
And most people believe in the message of Christ.

00:07:46.065 --> 00:07:49.198
What could you say? What is the relationship of

00:07:49.223 --> 00:07:53.115
Sahaja Yoga and Christ? You could say

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:54.652
Yes, it's very important.

00:07:54.677 --> 00:07:57.227
Because he resides on one of our centers

00:07:57.252 --> 00:07:59.520
which is between the optic chiasma

00:07:59.545 --> 00:08:01.674
and its very important because

00:08:01.705 --> 00:08:04.827
he is the one by getting himself curisified

00:08:04.852 --> 00:08:06.575
He opened that chakra.

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:10.879
That is the fifth chakra within us, and it reacts very well.

00:08:10.904 --> 00:08:15.702
I mean, I should say the sixth, because we are not considering the lowest one.

00:08:15.727 --> 00:08:19.860
But when it opens out, you see, what happens is that

00:08:19.885 --> 00:08:25.715
this Kundalini, this power, can pierce through and go into the limbic area.

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:29.463
From the limbic area, then it pierces through the fontanel bone area,

00:08:29.488 --> 00:08:33.159
which gives you the actualization of baptism.

00:08:33.184 --> 00:08:36.079
It's not just talk or this kind of thing.

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:37.299
It's actualization.

00:09:16.395 --> 00:09:20.675
Is it difficult to have the actualization of a Kundalini?

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:22.261
No, no, just a second.

00:09:22.286 --> 00:09:25.642
If the Kundalini is awakened and it connects

00:09:25.667 --> 00:09:30.425
you to the All-Pervading Power through your fontanel bone area.

00:09:45.573 --> 00:09:51.155
What could you say that it's a relation of Sahaja Yoga with religion?

00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:54.624
I mean, that way all religions are the same.

00:09:54.649 --> 00:10:00.275
You see, we have with our ignorance made them different, we are fighting and all that.

00:10:00.313 --> 00:10:09.861
Religion is something that is our innate understanding of religiosity, you can call it.

00:10:37.405 --> 00:10:44.904
The last question would be, which could be your message for the Greek people?

00:10:45.319 --> 00:10:48.335
Greeks are, should I hold it also?

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:49.440
Not necessary.

00:10:49.725 --> 00:10:56.355
The Greeks are very ancient culture and they go very well with Indian culture.

00:10:56.380 --> 00:11:01.735
But they have forgotten now their culture and are very westernized, you see, that's the problem.

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:03.792
Also it's happening in India.

00:11:03.817 --> 00:11:07.975
But otherwise, they had the primordial mother, Athena.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.655
They had all the things that we had in our country.

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:16.440
So, if they can take to their old culture and to their

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:20.575
old religion, they will be very near Sahaja Yoga.

00:12:12.892 --> 00:12:21.707
 What they realize that is  Sahaja Yoga  something very important for every human being and those for the society.

00:12:21.732 --> 00:12:25.780
 Thank you very much and we hope to see you soon in Greece very soon.

00:12:25.805 --> 00:12:26.795
Thank you very much.

00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:27.920
May God bless you.

00:12:32.905 --> 00:12:36.239
Ladies and gentlemen good evening, we are in Turkey

00:12:36.264 --> 00:12:42.465
where soon we will meet with the founder of SY Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi

00:12:42.492 --> 00:12:45.038
Sahaja Yoga exists in 70 countries,

00:12:45.079 --> 00:12:52.400
among which is Greece, where there are Sahaja Yoga centers in Athens and Volos
