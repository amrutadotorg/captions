00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.420
They are transformed

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.930
Exeter has a speciality. I don't know why with this kind, and I'm really amazed that I've been here three times

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.790
and

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.419
People have not taken up life seriously

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.810
They are not taken up

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.308
The purpose for which they are born

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.790
It's a sad thing I feel

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.589
But again I wanted to try that maybe

00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:49.908
You people will be able to realize how important it is to get your self-realization

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:56.239
Already they must have told you about your Kundalini

00:00:57.839 --> 00:00:59.839
The power

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.650
That works out

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.580
this miracle of your second birth

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:11.779
It's already being done by God. He's put everything down there. It's all there. You are just ready for it

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.540
But you must have the desire

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.060
You must have an ardent desire

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.970
there cannot be any

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.529
realization for a person or any development for a person

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:27.480
If

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:28.890
the person

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.690
Doesn't desire

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:37.669
Your desire is the most important thing. I will be amazed that even the Kundalini about which we are talking

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:44.929
Is nothing but your primal desire the power of your primal desire because all other desires are

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.220
transitory

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.929
Or absolutely temporary, and they fizzle out

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.409
You want to have a house alright you can have a house

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.800
Then you want to have something else and then something else

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.190
economic ones are never sizable

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.690
So you won't ask them for this and that then you go to politics for

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:07.860
power

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:14.959
You try to have some emotional experiences all these are transitory and they all vanish into thin air

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:22.049
While the joy of the Spirit is the permanent, but people who are not?

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:29.069
Desiring it are asking for privileged things and things that are of no value at all

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:32.369
I tell you it is of no value to have all these things

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.589
Because you are so affluent already still there is no joy. There's no happiness there

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.840
Is no peace in the family. There's no please so we have to achieve that

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:45.340
Which is permanent?

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.209
Which is eternal? Which is promised to us?

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:52.979
You have been very carefully made into this being the human being

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.450
Is the epitome of?

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.500
The creation, but how far do we value ourselves?

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.200
about human existence

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:05.158
Don't you realize that thousands of years

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:12.899
The nature has worked to make us human beings and that at this time when you have to just become the spirit

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:15.109
We are hesitating

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:21.569
We still are dominated by desires which are not the primary desires

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.889
Normally when the Kundalini awakens a

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:33.690
Person definitely gets transformed, and he gets the power to get over all the

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:36.418
Nonsensical ideas about life all this

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.629
Misidentifications drop out I have known so many cases

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:42.239
We had a boy who came

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.370
from some

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.609
Pub I think and he was shouting at me, but screaming at me, and he was very very

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.599
funny

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:54.579
But he got his realization

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:58.409
Lucky he got his realization from next day. He came up

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:05.249
Everything there was no alcoholism the problem which doctors cannot solve nobody can treat him

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.620
There are so many who were suffering

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.179
From diseases which were absolutely incurable just got alright

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:17.880
That's physical side so many emotional problems like people who were mad lunatic got cured

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:24.598
But the spiritual problem is the main problem where people go to fake gurus and fake people there him lots of money

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:31.260
Run like mad and then they come back and find that they that was a faithful and they give up

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:35.229
But why why do like the fake guru so much and not sahaja, yoga?

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:39.520
We should find out why why is it that the fake gurus in this Exeter?

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:44.770
We had a fake guru who had thousands of disciples, and why for sahaja yoga?

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:52.689
We can't get people the reason is say plain and simple I was told that this gentleman who was supposed to be the Guru

00:04:53.810 --> 00:05:00.310
Used to drink us to have women do all kinds of things and every disciple was allowed to have any kind of

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.510
Unrighteous life that they want

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:08.379
Because no power was given to the disciples only they had one power is to pay to this horrible, man

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:13.210
That's all they power. They had and they thought that we can purchase this room

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:17.319
We can buy this man and by buying this man. We are something

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.590
Oh, there's another one who talks that you will become great

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:24.189
You have to be very great Christ was nothing you are going to become very great

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:30.849
All such talks sometimes really pamper our ego, and we get driven to that

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:37.930
One should know that one has to be real and honest if you are honored not honest to yourself

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:44.379
How can anybody else make it you have to be honest yourself first of all that you must know that you want the?

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:49.270
Reality, and if you want the reality was no you cannot pay for it. You cannot pay for it

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:54.400
You have to become you have to become that that becoming. It's not so difficult

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.530
I tell you it is not at all difficult

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:02.169
Because so many people who have got realization in England there are in thousands, and they are doing very well

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.289
there are beautiful people there are all realized Souls and

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:12.069
They know how to handle the Kundalini they also cure people not only that but their lives are changed that patterns are changed they are

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:14.070
Very happy joyous people

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:18.039
This has to happen the time has come of your resurrection

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.400
The whole of humanity has to rise to it

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:28.120
This is the only solution that you can think of for all the turmoils all the destruction that is facing us today

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:34.570
But do we realize that we are playing a part in their destruction if you do not take to this lift

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:41.530
This lift is very important in our lives, and we have to do it. I do not know why but it

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:47.229
Is really surprising why people do not want to become themselves?

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:51.279
To bring it yourself is the must you are the master of yourself

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:57.699
You have to be the master of yourself and not of some sort of silly ideas and stupid things

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:00.399
if you become the master

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:08.770
That's really nothing can dominate you you become the free bird you become absolutely on top of everything and you can see everything as

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:15.609
Just a drama and a witness all this is within you all these powers are within you because the Spirit is within

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:19.210
The Kundalini is within

00:07:19.639 --> 00:07:21.469
you have to just

00:07:21.469 --> 00:07:23.469
first of all get your realization

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:26.079
Enlightenment and maintain it for a while

00:07:26.289 --> 00:07:33.939
and you don't need much effort because after realization you are really empowered you get over your frivolities you get over your

00:07:34.129 --> 00:07:40.959
Stupidities, and you get homework all these nagging habits that put you down your self-respect and everything

00:07:42.169 --> 00:07:44.408
Now it is easy

00:07:45.139 --> 00:07:49.029
For people to go to any you know whatsoever because you don't have to do anything you

00:07:49.099 --> 00:07:55.329
Just have to go pay some money, and you become the disciple the guru who doesn't do anything he doesn't even travel

00:07:55.330 --> 00:08:00.550
He doesn't do anything he sits nicely you go and give you money, and he enjoys your money, and he's a parasite

00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:04.990
But here you are the Guru you have to become the Guru

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:11.979
Here you have to become the self you have to be the Guru, which is the principle already in you it is to be enlightened?

00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:20.019
You cannot depend on anyone you have to depend on yourself, and you are already entitle and empower to be that

00:08:20.659 --> 00:08:22.659
sahaja sahaja means

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.959
Bond with you so her is with bondage this power to be united with the divine is

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:32.500
With you it is within you and the time has come

00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:38.799
This is the Blossom time and this time you have to get it if you lack behind you have to face the problems

00:08:38.959 --> 00:08:45.489
You have to face the problems later, so those who call themselves as seekers. Those who say that we are seeking God

00:08:45.529 --> 00:08:51.849
we are seeking the truth must know that to see the truth is to see the truth within themselves and not without if

00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:56.169
Somebody says that you are going to fly in the air you have to see the stars in the moon's

00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:58.939
That's not to be

00:08:58.939 --> 00:09:06.759
Within yourself you have to see what you are and when you start feeling your spirit you start feeling others also

00:09:07.189 --> 00:09:11.799
Because your spirit is the collective being you have to become again

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:18.159
I say you have to become that spirit so far your spirit is just watching you it doesn't come into the play

00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:24.490
It doesn't come into the play it is still there in a state we can call as a witness

00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:31.750
He is witnessing all that you are doing but once the Kundalini rises from its base. Where as you see in the triangular bone?

00:09:32.269 --> 00:09:36.669
it comes up breaks through and you start feeling the

00:09:37.879 --> 00:09:39.709
existence of

00:09:39.709 --> 00:09:40.970
spirit

00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:45.670
On your nervous system you can feel it in your hands

00:09:45.769 --> 00:09:49.419
It is so simple that even children can feel it

00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:53.229
Say for example in this room you have to put a light

00:09:54.199 --> 00:09:56.438
Just you have to press one button and you get the light

00:09:56.870 --> 00:10:01.269
But it's not so simple to look at it look simple. It looks absolutely life

00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:07.029
If you tell a villager the one who has never seen how electricity works, you won't believe it

00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:10.930
You won't believe that this is possible. It is so naive for his mind

00:10:10.930 --> 00:10:15.699
Also that how can it be just you press the button and you get the light, but you do with the light?

00:10:15.699 --> 00:10:18.459
And how because there is a mechanism here?

00:10:19.639 --> 00:10:25.448
There is an organization behind it then it's a history behind, and there is an evolution behind it now

00:10:25.449 --> 00:10:31.419
We are standing at the last part of our evolution the human awareness that it is today

00:10:32.089 --> 00:10:36.849
Is still not complete if it was we would not have been so much confused

00:10:37.129 --> 00:10:42.099
We are confused because our awareness has not reached that stage where we become the spirit

00:10:42.889 --> 00:10:48.969
Christ has said you are to be born again. Now. There are people. I heard the other day the one gentleman came and started talking

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:55.899
Just like a tape recorder that Christ was just a Kundalini yogi, and all that thing who are they to judge Christ?

00:10:55.899 --> 00:10:57.899
What do they know about what?

00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:03.430
Is their power to judge him you see any big Tom and Harry stands up and start talking about anyone?

00:11:03.769 --> 00:11:08.019
First of all let us know what is your power? Let's see, what do you know?

00:11:08.019 --> 00:11:10.089
What how do you found yourself?

00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:16.130
Please be honest about please be honest. That's all is needed because the whole nature

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:19.040
the whole creation

00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:24.469
All the pervading power of course Allah is trying to do this for you

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:30.289
Everyone is time to die sometimes really people are preferred because the way I see these days

00:11:30.570 --> 00:11:35.089
miracles happening to thousands of people getting realization I myself amazed

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:37.529
how the

00:11:37.529 --> 00:11:42.799
Divine you itself has taken upon itself to give this

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:49.820
Realization to you to give this experience to you to do this for it is something so remarkable

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:52.190
The whole compulsion is working out

00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:57.020
This great work this great drama of giving

00:11:57.330 --> 00:12:02.689
realizations to you of course if you are not a seeker you will take that I mean you can teach people to see

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:06.830
You have to be hungry if you are not seeking. It's not easy

00:12:06.830 --> 00:12:08.339
I know it is very difficult

00:12:08.339 --> 00:12:15.079
And if you are not seeking you will take I think some time to do it some people who are not seeking

00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:18.979
Also when they see so many coming to sahaja yoga getting cured

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:21.180
Having a better life

00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:24.919
Enjoying themselves becoming such good people also follow them

00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:31.489
But those who are seekers do not wait for any such things. They just jump into it get it and become

00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:34.130
Are we going to waste our human life?

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:36.799
Are we not going to be what we are meant for?

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:42.169
For example see this instrument is made with such difficulties and with such

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:46.700
Care but if you do not put this to the mains

00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:49.410
What's the use?

00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:52.010
What's the use of this instrument is it's a waste?

00:12:52.010 --> 00:12:58.669
It's just a waste and that's what one should know that you should put it to the mains and put into the mains itself means

00:12:58.829 --> 00:13:00.829
getting realization

00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:02.190
Yoga means

00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:07.279
Union with the divine the divine power that is all-pervading this divine power

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:13.700
Is there we can see its effects all the living work is done by that power a?

00:13:13.950 --> 00:13:16.039
Flower becomes a fruit through that power

00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:18.209
we

00:13:18.209 --> 00:13:20.899
Exist because of that power if you see these eyes

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:28.440
How beautifully God meant how beautifully he has made us all that is done by this God's loving power which is

00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:34.980
All-pervading it is very subtle you cannot feel it because with this awareness. We are not yet that subject

00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:38.489
Only after realization you can feel that power

00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:44.399
And you start feeling it as the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost that should happen to all of you

00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:47.040
even if it happens you must keep the

00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:54.719
Connection all right if you are loosely connected if you do not put in effort to keep the connection on

00:13:54.970 --> 00:14:00.089
sometimes it drops off and that's what I find people become extremely critical and

00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:02.670
extremely

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:07.829
High-handed they think that why should I do this?

00:14:07.830 --> 00:14:11.040
Why should I do this because that is how you keep the connection?

00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:15.600
You will be amazed that in India thousands of people have got realization in the religion

00:14:16.090 --> 00:14:19.410
Thousands and in this Exeter how many people are fine today three?

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:25.290
You are lagging behind, I am telling you're lagging behind once I go - how many kind

00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:29.519
No Americans will take to it very fast because they are fed up of guru shopping

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:37.800
They are absolutely tired of it. They don't want to talk about it, and they want to have self-realization, but here. What are we doing?

00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:40.470
You can imagine that

00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:45.480
Thousands of people have already got realization. They are transformed while people

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.830
Otherwise or too much critical thing too much about it

00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:54.270
Do not get it, but we must come to logical conclusions

00:14:55.450 --> 00:15:01.680
Without coming to logical conclusion you should not jump on to anything blindly that's absolutely wrong use your brains

00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:05.399
I say like today the gentleman at the BBC asked me that

00:15:06.430 --> 00:15:08.200
How is it?

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:11.490
Many people are going to these fake gurus and paying them such a lot of money

00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:15.749
I said they should use their brains what has happened to their brains. Why don't they use their bigs?

00:15:16.270 --> 00:15:22.980
First of all you cannot pay for God's love. That's simple very simple as that you cannot pay for his

00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:25.420
Love you have never beat

00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:31.079
You know paid for becoming human beings you never paid for getting a flower into a fruit you

00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:37.879
Cannot pay for all these things secondly you cannot put in any effort for a spontaneous thing

00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:40.580
Whatever is living happens spontaneously

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:43.399
This is a living process of the Living God

00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:49.129
So come to right conclusion that if anything has to happen to us it has to happen within

00:15:50.010 --> 00:15:52.999
It has to happen in a way where we do not put in any effort

00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:55.700
Where we do not paint?

00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:57.829
minimum of minimum this much we should

00:15:58.530 --> 00:16:05.180
Understand that this cannot be then the person who talks of God of divine love and things if he is interested in your purse

00:16:05.850 --> 00:16:09.559
If he's interested in your women who leads an unrighteous life

00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:13.310
He has no business to be a good he has no business to be there

00:16:14.430 --> 00:16:16.549
Then we have to come to another conclusion

00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:22.670
Very positively we are seekers. We are seekers of truth. We are seeking God

00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:26.930
We are seeking the divine and unless until we find it. We are not going to rest

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:31.039
We have to find it at any cost you might have done lots of mistakes

00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:35.269
I know in seeking people have done lots of mistake. They have gone to wrong places

00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:41.930
They have been hit people had epilepsy that all kinds of things. I know that doesn't matter all these things can be

00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:45.680
Corrected and improved because as I told you

00:16:46.770 --> 00:16:50.629
the divine power itself the divinity itself God Himself

00:16:51.330 --> 00:16:54.470
wants to save his creation because you are the epitome of

00:16:54.990 --> 00:17:00.199
His creation he wants to give you this, but it is not because you live in a particular place

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:05.660
And if you are arrogant or egoistical or if you are afraid that he is going to bother about

00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:12.259
For him the whole race of human beings is just the same if you are a human being you can get your realization

00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:19.280
That soil is wanted that you have to be a human being and the second is the people who are really seeking get it very

00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:20.430
fast

00:17:20.430 --> 00:17:25.580
Some people get it very fast and also lose it very fast because they do not understand the value of that

00:17:25.650 --> 00:17:31.729
the idea that we have to suffer for spirituality is absolutely out of take and absolutely out of

00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:36.259
Any context because if you know Christ has suffered for us

00:17:36.810 --> 00:17:43.580
He has suffered for us and people said that once he has suffered for us. He sucks in our sits

00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:46.790
He sucks in our Karma's then why are you suffering?

00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:54.149
Why do you want to suffer has he not suffered sufficiently he is to be awakened within that's what it is once

00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:58.289
he's awakened within you he sucks in as you can see clearly they're at the

00:17:58.809 --> 00:18:01.259
point here where it is between the

00:18:01.870 --> 00:18:06.390
Optic chiasma near the pituitary and the pineal body is placed this subtle Center

00:18:06.549 --> 00:18:10.889
Which when awakened sucks in the ego and superego under the sacs?

00:18:12.730 --> 00:18:15.209
So everything will be forgiven

00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:19.319
There's nothing to worry about the past nothing to feel guilty

00:18:19.929 --> 00:18:25.469
Everything can be worked out so easily if the Kundalini is allowed to rise it can suck it

00:18:25.779 --> 00:18:32.369
Once the center is awakened. There's no problem at all and you get your realization quite all right today

00:18:32.370 --> 00:18:36.630
I was surprised that at BBC this thing the gentlemen both of them the producer

00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:40.020
when the director both of them got realization

00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:46.079
it's such a good thing to see that those people who are not so much concerned with spirit and

00:18:46.419 --> 00:18:52.799
Not concerned with spiritual ascent got the realization. I was really enamored. I'm so very happy about it

00:18:52.799 --> 00:18:59.009
I mean there are people and people who get realised no doubt like in India I would say that

00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:06.179
People understand who is a real guru and Muslim because they are not lying about

00:19:06.429 --> 00:19:10.109
This is the knowledge about the roots while you know about the shoot

00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:12.929
You don't know what the roots while they know about the roots

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.609
They know what it is how to find it what happens, and how you achieve it

00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:22.230
Everyone knows about Kundalini you won't find any Indian who doesn't know about Kundalini

00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:24.870
Maybe they are westernized Western eyes icons

00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:29.399
But everyone knows it is the Kundalini awakening by which you get your realization

00:19:29.399 --> 00:19:33.719
So now I have to request again to all of you living in Exeter

00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:38.730
I have a feeling that Exeter has lots of seekers, but they're somehow lost somewhere

00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:41.610
I don't know. What's happening to them, and I'm very much concerned

00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:46.590
Because maybe next time I may not be able to come here. I come all the way from London

00:19:46.590 --> 00:19:52.409
Just to see them and what I find that they just take realization and finish off

00:19:52.409 --> 00:20:00.249
It's a very sad thing and it should be so peculiar of this place that I can't understand. What's the reason why it happens? I?

00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:02.980
Went to Vienna where

00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:05.120
sixty people

00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:07.389
got realization in first shot and

00:20:08.269 --> 00:20:10.269
They are increasing

00:20:10.309 --> 00:20:12.428
Every country's like that Switzerland

00:20:12.429 --> 00:20:14.090
If you go there are at least

00:20:14.090 --> 00:20:19.569
Thousand people who have got realization of course London because I have been there for eight years so you can imagine there are lots of

00:20:19.570 --> 00:20:20.870
people who have got realization

00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:22.490
But one has to know that

00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:28.000
After getting realization you should not just sit back and say no nothing you have to see that your connection is established

00:20:28.490 --> 00:20:34.929
For which all the knowledge will be given to you and you see that you reached a little it's a very small thing

00:20:35.169 --> 00:20:40.329
That is to be done. If you really respect us your life as such as a human being as

00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:44.470
Much as I respect it as much as I love I?

00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:49.479
Am sure even one thousandth of that if you could understand what you are

00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:54.279
You would do it because you are nothing but the spirit the Spirit

00:20:54.279 --> 00:21:00.459
Which is the joy the spirit? Which is the attention and the spirit that is the complete beauty?

00:21:01.730 --> 00:21:04.750
This is what you have to be you don't call yourself ugly

00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:11.829
Or don't feel at all unhappy that you haven't got this or that no inadequacy and no picked

00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:15.909
Nothing is going to stop you from getting realization. This is a

00:21:16.490 --> 00:21:22.179
Day when I feel something should happen here also again, and that people should really rise

00:21:23.090 --> 00:21:28.840
About petty things and get to themselves and develop their realization wrong

00:21:29.210 --> 00:21:34.240
Imagine Rome a place like Rome. We have so many sahaja Yogi's and here is somebody who has come now

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:39.819
We are importing people from outside to come to Exeter because so many people in London. Got really fed up

00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:42.850
They just don't know what to do with the people in Exeter

00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:49.029
Why why are they not serious about their lives, so I would request you today

00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:55.720
Please for heaven's sake try to get your realization and establish yourself. Thank you very much may God bless you

00:21:56.269 --> 00:22:00.008
Will you please ask me questions if there are any I would like to answer them?

00:22:00.009 --> 00:22:01.149
But ask questions

00:22:01.149 --> 00:22:03.999
Which are relevant and not somebody gurus as this and that?

00:22:04.129 --> 00:22:06.489
You see if you have got to say something

00:22:06.559 --> 00:22:12.739
You should find your own halls and say but not to represent here some guru if he has given you something why here

00:22:13.290 --> 00:22:18.050
Is a simple thing as that I would like you to ask me questions, which are relevant and censored

00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:35.520
No questions yes, please yes

00:22:44.890 --> 00:22:45.570
It's true

00:22:45.570 --> 00:22:53.040
I great agree with you that evolution happens up to the human stage after the human says spontaneously is true

00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:59.099
But at this stage of human beings you see we are specially made because we have lifted our head

00:22:59.230 --> 00:23:03.900
And this is has come in to us. You see the animals don't have that eyeness

00:23:03.930 --> 00:23:07.589
We have that eyeness and because of that happening what happens

00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:14.939
But it the ego and superego meet here and get calcified and you become mr. Xu maker mr.

00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:19.860
Y so your awareness is very different from that of an animal and in this awareness

00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:25.079
You must get that you have watched your realization if you don't get it you cannot use it it

00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:30.300
cannot be like an animal to human being it has to be awful of a

00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:36.570
Nature that you know about you are aware of it if you are not aware that you have got your realization

00:23:36.570 --> 00:23:38.730
Then you won't be able to use it further

00:23:39.730 --> 00:23:44.370
That's why this is important that you should get it in your awareness very good question

00:23:51.850 --> 00:23:53.850
But breathing exercise

00:23:55.450 --> 00:23:59.939
Yes, I agree with you, it's very confusing you all right, it's very confusing I agree with you

00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:03.060
You see whatever people say you shouldn't believe it now

00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:07.859
You must see for you even what I say you should not believe but keep yourself open all right now

00:24:07.890 --> 00:24:12.270
Some say you should do breathing exercise now. You should think about it. You see by breathing

00:24:12.270 --> 00:24:13.510
It's a living process

00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:20.160
What I said you come to right conclusion that you value study process is a living process all right so for living process

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:23.459
Supposing you have to a seat all right

00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:28.410
What do you do you take a seat and put it in the mother earth when you put it in the mother earth?

00:24:28.410 --> 00:24:32.069
She has the capacity to sprout all right, but supposing you

00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:36.599
Bleeding exercises you do or don't particularly like it won't it won't come up

00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:41.610
It will only come up if the person who has authority to enlighten you can enlighten

00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:47.679
And then once you're enlightened you can enlighten another person so that you can verify whether you are enlightened or not

00:24:47.870 --> 00:24:52.299
You can see with your naked eyes the pulsation of the Kundalini the rising of the Kundalini

00:24:52.549 --> 00:24:54.759
You can you can feel it with the stethoscope

00:24:54.889 --> 00:24:56.979
It comes upon your head here

00:24:56.980 --> 00:25:02.439
And it breaks when it breaks there the sound stops you can hear locked up

00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:08.049
Just like the heart beat going up and it breaks up here, and you start feeling the cool breeze coming out of your head

00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:15.010
but the transformation starts working out gradually within you which you start seeing and you can verify it so you see -

00:25:15.470 --> 00:25:17.919
If you say that it is spontaneous it should happen

00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:24.010
But at this stage it cannot because you have to enter into the kingdom of God you are special people

00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:28.000
So you have to be aware of it you should know that now I'm here everyone

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:32.500
We never knew till till now having put up this theory that we are hog. Evolved is sentient

00:25:32.529 --> 00:25:37.599
We never knew that we have evolved from amoeba to this stage that was alright, but today you have to know

00:25:38.690 --> 00:25:42.669
Because that is the blessing of God which you should know and you should know everything

00:25:42.799 --> 00:25:48.849
Not only that but you should know what are these centers how they work out how you can handle them how can I arrange them?

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:52.839
How can you give realization? How can you raise other's Kundalini everything you have to know?

00:25:53.480 --> 00:26:00.939
Absolutely without paying anything all this knowledge you have to have now for breathing somebody says you do breathing exercise now that is also

00:26:01.130 --> 00:26:03.130
One has to do sometimes in sahaja, yoga

00:26:04.039 --> 00:26:07.089
But in sahaja yoga, the first thing is the awakening of the Kundalini

00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:12.820
because supposing you have a problem of the central heart as they call it now here you see the

00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:15.490
Green one and the yellow one

00:26:15.490 --> 00:26:21.159
There's another center there the green you see this green and that being with another bluish Center

00:26:21.159 --> 00:26:26.379
If you see that Center one if that is out of order then you have to do a kind of a breathing exercise

00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:34.000
If that is out of order not, otherwise you see it is the way we are doing everything is indiscriminate

00:26:34.519 --> 00:26:36.638
We try to do something which is

00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:43.059
Not necessary or which is which has no relationship to our troubles for our weaknesses

00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:46.839
It's like supposing now. I have to go to London now

00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:50.529
I don't know how the traffic is going to be on the way all right, so I

00:26:51.230 --> 00:26:54.159
Before had if I started pushing for the traffic is

00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:58.599
Absurd because I am not facing it when the Kundalini moves

00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:04.480
Then only you will know where the problem is and then you should try to solve it if it is at a low

00:27:05.450 --> 00:27:12.730
Motul or centers are at the higher centers you have to do something else all the exercises that are told

00:27:13.610 --> 00:27:19.449
In the path Anjali over Shastra, or just a wee bit of the whole thing. There are rush talents

00:27:19.450 --> 00:27:22.059
there are eight Angas of the

00:27:23.450 --> 00:27:26.050
yoga out of that one

00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:34.630
One of them has got your money amout of which one-third are the exercises these exercises only correct with backbone

00:27:35.330 --> 00:27:40.990
The physical side of it not the secular side of it so when you just start looking after your health

00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:44.649
person your physical side you neglect your emotional side a

00:27:45.679 --> 00:27:49.359
Person who looks after his health too much can be a very diapers

00:27:49.790 --> 00:27:55.359
Absolutely feeling is he can become absolutely feeling this if somebody dies you won't feel anything anything

00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:56.920
I become a great saint

00:27:56.920 --> 00:28:01.119
But he'll be a hot-tempered fellow extremely hot-tempered you can't go near him

00:28:01.550 --> 00:28:06.159
If you go near and very much in your back or may bite you so that sort of a thing might happen

00:28:06.290 --> 00:28:08.290
So you have to understand in?

00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:10.960
complete integration

00:28:11.090 --> 00:28:17.709
Where is the problem? What is the problem and what is the treatment needed but once it happens to you?

00:28:17.710 --> 00:28:25.030
Then only you will know you can verify it one after another so this is what it is you have to know about everything?

00:28:25.429 --> 00:28:27.429
You must know why you are doing what?

00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:30.730
This why you have to do it. What is the need to do this?

00:28:30.730 --> 00:28:37.360
What's to need to do that, but if somebody tells you just do this stand on your heads you start doing that one?

00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:40.630
Why should we stand on orange? What is the need to stand on our heads?

00:28:41.179 --> 00:28:44.859
Everything should be logical as I said, but once you get your realization

00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:52.059
The whole thing becomes so logical because you start understanding the laws of the divine once you understand those laws

00:28:52.059 --> 00:28:54.609
Then you know by doing what you get one

00:28:55.370 --> 00:28:58.270
For example leukemia a disease dies leukemia

00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:03.759
We have cured, and we had cured look Amy a very silly cancer can be cured also

00:29:04.610 --> 00:29:06.610
Now whole look Amy as cost

00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:10.569
perhaps people do not know is caused because a

00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:13.480
Person is very hasty very speedy

00:29:13.909 --> 00:29:15.820
Very is South sort of in the morning

00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:21.939
He takes his breakfast in his hand sits on his car and all the time is you seen a haste

00:29:22.369 --> 00:29:26.499
Going for his book and there's a jam on the way, and he's absolutely upset

00:29:27.110 --> 00:29:30.610
This plane which is on the left-hand side see has to produce

00:29:31.759 --> 00:29:33.440
red blood corpuscles

00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:34.970
for your

00:29:34.970 --> 00:29:40.089
Emergencies and it becomes crazy it becomes absolutely crazy doesn't know what to do with the person who's doing

00:29:40.490 --> 00:29:46.269
3:14 simultaneously nicely when it becomes crazy the situation is created

00:29:46.999 --> 00:29:54.219
The situation for leukemia is created, and if it is triggered as a doctor say call it. They call it as

00:29:55.279 --> 00:29:59.169
Protein 58 protein 52 because doctors are honest

00:29:59.169 --> 00:30:04.299
They don't want to say more than what they hello, but when we know we can tell you that what it is

00:30:04.610 --> 00:30:09.279
But they say that these proteins entered into us. I am they triggered the

00:30:09.799 --> 00:30:11.090
cancer

00:30:11.090 --> 00:30:12.740
Now what are these proteins?

00:30:12.740 --> 00:30:18.909
They say that they come from an area which is built with innocence of a creation we call it as collective

00:30:18.980 --> 00:30:24.279
Subconscious all those things you will know how they trigger how they come in and what happens to

00:30:24.619 --> 00:30:29.319
It is very simple to understand because here we are dealing with the principles

00:30:29.419 --> 00:30:34.778
Which create it once it gets out of principles, then it gets on you see

00:30:35.299 --> 00:30:39.609
Complicated, but if you know how to handle the principle you can correct it and can manage it

00:30:39.610 --> 00:30:45.639
It's a fact you can verify it yourself, and you have to verify keep your mind open and see for yourself

00:30:46.850 --> 00:30:48.850
All right, thank you

00:30:57.340 --> 00:30:59.340
Should we have the experience now

00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:04.890
Alright, but you all have to promise me that I'll work it out, but you must continue with it

00:31:04.890 --> 00:31:10.919
You should not just give it that way because that's not good. That's very very sad as Christ has said a parable that

00:31:11.590 --> 00:31:13.590
some seeds fell on the rocks I

00:31:14.890 --> 00:31:19.020
Saw a beautiful red rocks near Exeter. I hope

00:31:19.809 --> 00:31:26.459
Also, that is very beautiful soil, which is red and nice I saw already good barley fields and other fields

00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:29.640
I hope there are people who will receive realization

00:31:30.370 --> 00:31:36.120
as sprout into beautiful trees of sahaja yoga, may God bless

00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:40.980
You have to just now again

00:31:40.980 --> 00:31:42.549
I'll tell you you have to do few things

00:31:42.549 --> 00:31:46.679
Which are simple you have to take out your shoes for one reason that the mother earth?

00:31:46.809 --> 00:31:50.309
Helps us to suck in the problem. You see so just take out your shoes

00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:55.350
Nothing extraordinary has to be done

00:31:57.580 --> 00:31:59.580
Those people can come forward

00:32:10.269 --> 00:32:13.258
How are you today are you feeling all right this gentleman

00:32:14.590 --> 00:32:21.149
Are you all right? How are you feeling you can't how are you?

00:32:23.649 --> 00:32:25.649
All right

00:32:31.030 --> 00:32:37.169
Just put your hands like this it's all wrong. I mean you should be cheerful about absolutely cheerful

00:32:37.169 --> 00:32:39.929
It's just there you to find it. That's all

00:32:41.559 --> 00:32:47.369
This is your property which are going to have there's no obligation nothing. It's just your own

00:32:48.190 --> 00:32:50.140
Be cheerful about it

00:32:50.140 --> 00:32:54.780
It's nothing to be frightened. Nothing is going to its face up. Just put your hands, right

00:32:58.270 --> 00:33:00.270
Close your eyes, please close your eyes

00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:03.059
now don't open your eyes still I tell you because

00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:09.270
The Kundalini doesn't rise above a certain center of arghya if your eyes are open down

00:33:09.270 --> 00:33:12.659
So please keep them closed this test see this is against

00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:17.069
Hypnotism where they put some spirits through eyes

00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:22.409
so keep your eyes shut because there is dilatation of the pupil when the kundalini rises and

00:33:22.929 --> 00:33:26.999
If the Kundalini is the eyes are not closed it stops at a point?

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:32.369
So just help yourself little bit cooperate with me, and it will work out. I am sure it will work out just

00:33:33.730 --> 00:33:36.929
Cooperate with me a little bit put both the hands towards me

00:33:37.330 --> 00:33:43.169
Just like this would both the hands if you have anything tight on your body you can loosen it a little bit and be

00:33:43.299 --> 00:33:47.729
comfortable you have to be comfortable if anything tight on your body just

00:33:48.429 --> 00:33:51.479
Loosen it if possible put both the hands towards me

00:33:55.690 --> 00:33:57.690
Just like that

00:33:57.970 --> 00:33:59.970
Keep your eyes set please

00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:06.569
Now the first thing I have to request you that you have to say mother I am NOT GUILTY

00:34:06.820 --> 00:34:09.270
This you say it at least three times with

00:34:09.730 --> 00:34:17.730
Complete confidence with complete belief in yourself that you are not guilty because whatever guilt you think of it's just a speck

00:34:17.889 --> 00:34:21.719
I'm talking about God who is the ocean of love?

00:34:22.389 --> 00:34:24.389
the ocean of compassion

00:34:24.429 --> 00:34:28.439
Ocean of forgiveness whatever you have done. Just forget it and say mother

00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:33.510
I am NOT GUILTY first of all you must respect yourself if you don't respect yourself. It's not going to work out

00:34:34.389 --> 00:34:36.389
Just say mother. I am NOT eating

00:34:42.849 --> 00:34:44.849
Three times to say mother I am NOT GUILTY

00:34:58.270 --> 00:35:02.639
Already some people must have started feeling the cool breeze through their vibrations are too much

00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:09.360
Now you put your right hand on your heart

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.750
Now ask me a question mother am

00:35:16.540 --> 00:35:22.980
I respect ask me a question thrice. Please just ask me a question with confidence mother am I the spirit

00:35:39.050 --> 00:35:42.310
Now bring that hand down you've already started feeling the cool breeze

00:35:50.140 --> 00:35:54.180
Down below you bring that hand down below on the left hand side on your stomach

00:35:56.950 --> 00:35:58.930
Now here at this point

00:35:58.930 --> 00:36:05.040
You have to say it ask a question again mother am I my own master am I my own guru

00:36:08.230 --> 00:36:15.300
Because you are but just ask the question by asking the question the center starts with me

00:36:20.170 --> 00:36:25.020
In a hundred way, please ask in a humble way mother am I my own guru

00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:42.790
Now raise it again the hand to your heart and say mother. I am the spirit

00:36:52.790 --> 00:36:55.269
Now 812 times

00:37:01.930 --> 00:37:07.109
With full confidence with full confidence a mother I am the spirit

00:37:22.340 --> 00:37:26.110
Now put this right hand on the left-hand side of your neck

00:37:31.790 --> 00:37:37.569
Now say mother I am NOT GUILTY say it sixteen times because this is the punishment for feeling guilty

00:37:40.130 --> 00:37:46.690
Is the word Center all of you have got I don't know why you sit down and start feeling guilty for nothing at all

00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:22.419
Now put your right hand away across your forehead across your forehead

00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:25.070
and

00:38:25.070 --> 00:38:26.750
Just say one thing

00:38:26.750 --> 00:38:27.920
twice

00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:30.100
mother genuinely honestly

00:38:30.100 --> 00:38:36.399
I forgive everyone you have to be honest if you are dishonest it won't work out mother. I forgive everyone

00:38:39.110 --> 00:38:41.110
Genuinely please say that

00:38:47.240 --> 00:38:51.159
This is how I'm teaching you also how to raise your own Kundalini I

00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:55.750
Forgive everyone

00:38:59.690 --> 00:39:01.690
Say twice

00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:05.469
Absolutely genuinely you said I forgive everyone

00:39:07.670 --> 00:39:09.670
Now put this hand on your head

00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:12.550
Resting on your head in the center

00:39:13.370 --> 00:39:16.149
To try to press it and see if it is hot or cold

00:39:17.030 --> 00:39:18.200
Jessie

00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:20.200
at this point I

00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:26.559
Have to request you because I cannot get over your freedom I cannot

00:39:27.230 --> 00:39:33.040
You have to ask for your realization. I cannot just force you down into it, so you have to say

00:39:34.910 --> 00:39:41.410
Mother please give me my realization just say that at that point unless and until you ask for it. I cannot do it

00:39:41.410 --> 00:39:43.410
I just can't do it I

00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:46.060
Cannot force you into it

00:39:46.490 --> 00:39:48.490
pressed a hard

00:39:48.530 --> 00:39:50.739
Hard hard you press it

00:39:56.720 --> 00:39:58.720
You can press it with fingers if you want

00:40:02.300 --> 00:40:05.019
Now raise your hand and see if there's a cool breeze coming out

00:40:07.340 --> 00:40:12.969
If not put your right hand and fill the left hand you can feel see if there's a cool breeze coming on

00:40:28.119 --> 00:40:33.028
Normally people should feel it, but if you are complicated is rather difficult, but normally you should

00:40:35.259 --> 00:40:37.259
Whole left is that you

00:40:48.700 --> 00:40:50.789
Put your another on and see

00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:03.980
Will the sahaja Yogi's see some of the people

00:41:06.180 --> 00:41:10.579
Because I'm in a hurry to go today, so just let's see if you can see this gentleman

00:41:10.580 --> 00:41:14.539
Maybe yes, I don't know this one so I question stand out

00:41:25.180 --> 00:41:28.409
Where's editfield he did feel yes, what about
