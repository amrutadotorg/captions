00:00:11.067 --> 00:00:16.234
Now the left side is the centre of the family life,

00:00:16.334 --> 00:00:20.434
the Gruhalaxshmi, the Goddess of the family,

00:00:20.534 --> 00:00:22.701
the household you see.

00:00:22.801 --> 00:00:27.501
A person who runs after money too much, forgets his family.

00:00:27.601 --> 00:00:29.501
He has no time for his family.

00:00:29.701 --> 00:00:33.534
The husband and wife may meet somewhere on the airport

00:00:33.634 --> 00:00:37.567
or may just wave at each other sometimes you see, crossing each other,

00:00:37.667 --> 00:00:40.000
or the children suffer the most.

00:00:40.234 --> 00:00:43.400
And in that case the women also then take up with the men,

00:00:43.501 --> 00:00:48.467
they compete what's wrong, they start copying men,

00:00:48.567 --> 00:00:52.634
and in so doing so, when they compete with each other,

00:00:52.734 --> 00:00:56.701
then what happens, that this family life gets disturbed.

00:00:56.934 --> 00:01:00.033
The woman of the household is dissatisfied,

00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:01.734
her ego is not satisfied.

00:01:01.834 --> 00:01:05.200
In olden times the man used to go in the jungle,

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.734
and get all the wood cut, bring it home,

00:01:07.834 --> 00:01:10.067
and give it to the wife and wife used to cook.

00:01:10.167 --> 00:01:13.167
There was no problem because there was barter system.

00:01:13.267 --> 00:01:15.000
He could see her working in the household.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.100
Now the husband earns the money and the woman spends.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.534
I mean that also requires some work, isn't it to spend the money.

00:01:22.634 --> 00:01:26.868
But to man it looks like, that I'm the earning member and she's the spender.

00:01:26.968 --> 00:01:29.400
So she said all right, I will also earn.

00:01:29.501 --> 00:01:33.868
But in this too much of competition, too much of competition like this,

00:01:33.968 --> 00:01:37.067
between the two, what happens, the family suffers,

00:01:37.167 --> 00:01:40.901
the children suffer and such a person will have problem with the wife,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.501
the wife will have problem with the husband

00:01:43.667 --> 00:01:48.067
and you can always feel that center on this finger, if that finger is catching,

00:01:48.167 --> 00:01:53.267
that means there's something wrong with your family relationship,

00:01:53.434 --> 00:01:56.868
that you have to adjust yourself, or he has to adjust.

00:01:56.968 --> 00:01:59.367
It's an important thing.

00:01:59.501 --> 00:02:04.100
Because you are like the flowers which have to produce a fruit.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.868
That's what nature wants.

00:02:05.968 --> 00:02:09.467
Nature wants that you are there to produce the,

00:02:09.701 --> 00:02:13.400
fruit, that is your children.

00:02:13.501 --> 00:02:17.534
That's why you are men and women. That's the basics.

00:02:21.334 --> 00:02:27.033
Now this Gruhalaxshmi's centre is on the left-hand side,

00:02:27.133 --> 00:02:31.033
and the another is Raja Laxshmi centre is on the right-hand side.

00:02:31.133 --> 00:02:35.901
Now this center gives us the power to rule over people

00:02:35.968 --> 00:02:37.534
and we become very,

00:02:37.634 --> 00:02:39.868
in extremes you see we can become very arrogant

00:02:39.968 --> 00:02:43.934
and we can become very very, sort of authoritative

00:02:44.033 --> 00:02:47.300
and we might, sort of end up with a funeral

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.868
with ten thousand people behind us, all bought from market

00:02:52.968 --> 00:02:56.567
and put there behind you without any feelings, that's all finished.

00:02:56.667 --> 00:02:59.200
With such a man finished they'll say, oh thank God he died,

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:03.100
he was a horrible terror for us.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.501
So, that kind of a life can come with Raja Laxshmi.

00:03:06.601 --> 00:03:10.767
But in the center is the Laxshmi.

00:03:10.868 --> 00:03:14.567
Laxshmi is the Goddess, is the power within us,

00:03:14.667 --> 00:03:18.801
by which we balance, lead a very balanced life,

00:03:18.901 --> 00:03:21.234
by which we are satisfied.

00:03:21.367 --> 00:03:23.834
Now they have made a beautiful picture of this Laxshmi

00:03:23.934 --> 00:03:27.434
also one should understand this power is a Lady,

00:03:27.534 --> 00:03:30.033
is a Mother and She stands on a lotus.

00:03:30.133 --> 00:03:34.033
Now these are all symbols which suggest that,

00:03:34.133 --> 00:03:39.767
these symbols are carved out with such deep significance.

00:03:39.868 --> 00:03:44.901
She stands on a lotus. Means imagine, who can stand on a lotus?

00:03:44.968 --> 00:03:48.000
And She's a very healthy woman, very healthy woman

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.734
and She stands on a lotus.

00:03:49.834 --> 00:03:55.133
It means that, that She is never putting pressure on anyone.

00:03:55.234 --> 00:04:00.100
A rich man comes in, he must honk his car, loudly,

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.300
because he's rich so he thinks he must honk it higher,

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.200
and a rich man must go in a big limousine

00:04:07.534 --> 00:04:10.434
or some sort of a thing to show off that he's very rich.

00:04:10.534 --> 00:04:12.968
If he comes to any program, or any he must sit in front,

00:04:13.067 --> 00:04:16.901
he should have the front seat, and he makes him known

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.100
everywhere everybody must feel the weight of the rich man.

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.667
He can run away with ten wives,

00:04:22.767 --> 00:04:27.601
of somebody and, he can have a big boat for himself,

00:04:27.701 --> 00:04:29.567
and he can get any number of women there

00:04:29.667 --> 00:04:33.200
and he can spoil any families he likes because he's rich.

00:04:33.634 --> 00:04:36.234
This kind of thing comes in in people

00:04:36.334 --> 00:04:40.667
but Laxshmi the One who has, stands on the lotus,

00:04:40.767 --> 00:04:44.834
is the beauty and the glory of the riches,

00:04:44.934 --> 00:04:47.767
that God has given that person.

00:04:47.868 --> 00:04:52.467
Then, it has got two red, pink flowers in the hand,

00:04:52.567 --> 00:04:54.868
that are lotus flowers again.

00:04:54.968 --> 00:05:01.234
Now the lotus is regarded as a very holy flower in India,

00:05:01.334 --> 00:05:03.968
because it is so receptive

00:05:04.067 --> 00:05:08.601
to everything that is crude and funny. First of all

00:05:08.701 --> 00:05:11.400
it is born in the mud.

00:05:11.501 --> 00:05:13.200
Just think of it,

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:17.634
in the mud, in the filth, where the horrible smell is coming out,

00:05:17.801 --> 00:05:19.734
the lotus is born.

00:05:19.834 --> 00:05:22.801
And the one lotus gives the fragrance,

00:05:22.901 --> 00:05:25.067
the beautiful fragrance to the whole atmosphere,

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.133
and kills all that's filth and everything,

00:05:28.234 --> 00:05:31.501
and covers the whole pond with its big big leaves

00:05:31.601 --> 00:05:35.067
so that it looks a beautiful pond.

00:05:35.167 --> 00:05:37.734
That's what is the lotus for.

00:05:37.834 --> 00:05:41.200
But this lotus is a pink lotus, means pink,

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:44.567
you know is the sign of love.

00:05:44.667 --> 00:05:46.200
Pink is the sign of love.

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.000
So such a person has to have tremendous love

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:51.634
and that softness of the lotus.

00:05:51.734 --> 00:05:55.467
Now the inside of the lotus is very soft and nice and a,

00:05:55.567 --> 00:06:00.701
I don't know what do you call that, the bee, the black bee,

00:06:00.801 --> 00:06:05.033
a very big one which has got horrible,

00:06:07.234 --> 00:06:10.534
no, the black bee, it's like that,

00:06:10.634 --> 00:06:13.133
which has got angular legs and things like that,

00:06:13.234 --> 00:06:15.200
horrible, you cannot touch it.

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:18.734
That one, can find its place in the lotus.

00:06:18.834 --> 00:06:21.667
When it goes to the lotus, the lotus opens its petals

00:06:21.767 --> 00:06:23.467
and takes it inside

00:06:23.567 --> 00:06:26.868
and makes it, sleep on the corona

00:06:26.968 --> 00:06:29.033
that it has, very soft one on the bed,

00:06:29.133 --> 00:06:32.701
and covers it nicely and gives it a nice,

00:06:32.801 --> 00:06:35.234
you see, swinging feeling,

00:06:35.334 --> 00:06:38.100
that it feels it is in the lap of the mother

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:39.534
and it sleeps off.

00:06:39.634 --> 00:06:43.734
Even such a animal, it gives a place to live.

00:06:43.834 --> 00:06:45.634
Now the man who is a laxshmipati

00:06:45.734 --> 00:06:47.868
the one who is blessed with Laxshmi,

00:06:47.968 --> 00:06:50.834
has to have a temperament like that.

00:06:50.934 --> 00:06:54.300
Anybody who comes to his house, anyone,

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:57.501
should be very readily accepted.

00:06:57.601 --> 00:07:00.300
I've seen people like that, I've seen in my lifetime,

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:02.834
should be accepted and they should be very gratified

00:07:02.934 --> 00:07:07.968
to have such people in the house and should feel that oh God,

00:07:08.067 --> 00:07:10.634
what a blessing it is that we have a guest in the house.

00:07:10.734 --> 00:07:14.534
But in modern times, we find out devices and methods,

00:07:14.634 --> 00:07:21.534
how to avoid guests, guests are equal to pests.

00:07:22.567 --> 00:07:25.801
I was in London, we were living on Surrey Hills

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.167
and we had bungalows, separate bungalows,

00:07:28.267 --> 00:07:31.601
quite good bungalows I should say, there were seven bungalows.

00:07:31.701 --> 00:07:34.033
And poor husbands were taken to tasks

00:07:34.133 --> 00:07:36.501
for mowing the lawns and everything and the wife used to tell them

00:07:36.667 --> 00:07:37.901
now come along do it properly

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.033
and the polishing of the, brass

00:07:40.133 --> 00:07:42.667
whatever was there and everything was done very well.

00:07:42.767 --> 00:07:47.300
But I didn't see even a rat enter those houses, even a rat,

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:48.968
I mean leave alone human beings.

00:07:49.067 --> 00:07:50.868
Nothing entered those houses,

00:07:50.968 --> 00:07:54.501
only these two persons used to come out and go in.

00:07:54.601 --> 00:07:57.701
And I don't know they might be having some yearly,

00:07:57.801 --> 00:07:59.934
some sort of a get-together, maybe.

00:08:00.033 --> 00:08:04.400
But nobody, while My house was naturally, I am like this,

00:08:04.501 --> 00:08:06.067
so it was open all the time,

00:08:06.167 --> 00:08:08.801
people would come in and go out and this and that

00:08:08.901 --> 00:08:11.033
and I was just enjoying their company.

00:08:11.133 --> 00:08:13.601
And one day they asked Me, what's the matter in Your house,

00:08:13.701 --> 00:08:15.801
all the time people are coming and going

00:08:15.901 --> 00:08:18.434
and used to wonder what is it going on inside.

00:08:18.534 --> 00:08:21.400
I said nothing, just they come, have tea and go, that's all,

00:08:21.501 --> 00:08:24.701
just some talk together, some rapport of love.

00:08:24.801 --> 00:08:27.067
But what is this, all the doors are closed,

00:08:27.167 --> 00:08:29.934
that way I must say Sydney people are very open hearted,

00:08:30.033 --> 00:08:33.901
and they are, they like to be together, there is a togetherness

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:34.968
in them. But with all this,

00:08:35.067 --> 00:08:39.133
if you cannot have togetherness,

00:08:39.234 --> 00:08:41.400
to enjoy your wealth with others, then what's the use

00:08:41.501 --> 00:08:43.267
of all the wealth.

00:08:43.367 --> 00:08:45.434
If you have wealth, you'll go for horse-racing,

00:08:45.534 --> 00:08:47.300
that's also your own enjoyment.

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:49.000
If you have wealth you will do something else

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:50.734
which is so individualistic.

00:08:50.834 --> 00:08:52.901
You cannot enjoy your wealth

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.200
unless and until you share it.

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:58.534
As I told you the other day that I am,

00:08:58.634 --> 00:09:02.934
a capitalist in the sense I have all the powers within Myself.

00:09:03.033 --> 00:09:05.701
But, I cannot live without sharing it,

00:09:05.801 --> 00:09:09.067
so I am the greatest communist, because I just cannot enjoy,

00:09:09.167 --> 00:09:11.167
that's why I had to come all the way to Australia

00:09:11.267 --> 00:09:14.601
and today My husband was so insistent that I should come back soon,

00:09:14.701 --> 00:09:17.200
I said: 'No, I have to meet all the Australians still,

00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:18.467
and then I'll come.'

00:09:18.567 --> 00:09:21.901
So unless and until you share this love after realization,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.467
you do not enjoy.

00:09:23.567 --> 00:09:27.667
All isms drop out, because you become combination of both extremes

00:09:27.767 --> 00:09:31.300
and you just start enjoying yourself.
