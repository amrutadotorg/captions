00:00:01.976 --> 00:00:05.976
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:00:09.101 --> 00:00:17.101
It's very nice to come back to Australia for the second time.

00:00:19.435 --> 00:00:24.685
And last time I could not come to Perth.

00:00:27.018 --> 00:00:30.976
I did not know that it was such a beautiful city,

00:00:31.185 --> 00:00:35.894
with such beautiful, spiritual vibrations.

00:00:37.894 --> 00:00:45.352
What Linda has talked to you or Dr. Warren has told you,

00:00:45.602 --> 00:00:49.685
is the knowledge of the roots.

00:00:50.934 --> 00:00:58.685
Now what we know through science or through our human senses,

00:00:59.644 --> 00:01:05.685
is the knowledge of the tree that we see obviously before us.

00:01:06.894 --> 00:01:12.060
But this is the knowledge of the root

00:01:12.352 --> 00:01:17.602
and if you have to nourish

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:23.352
the plant, you have to water the roots.

00:01:23.934 --> 00:01:27.268
No use just plucking up some flowers,

00:01:27.477 --> 00:01:33.644
or some leaves and treating them with something artificial.

00:01:36.518 --> 00:01:41.018
This knowledge can only be achieved,

00:01:41.393 --> 00:01:45.810
if you can somehow or other go to the roots.

00:01:46.101 --> 00:01:49.894
For example you are paying attention to Me just now.

00:01:50.226 --> 00:01:56.852
But if I say, " Please pay attention to yourself", you cannot do it.

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.934
You say, "How Mother? How to do it?"

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.185
So something has to happen within you,

00:02:04.435 --> 00:02:08.852
which should attract your attention inside,

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:16.644
so that you can get your attention which is outside,

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.685
in connection with the Spirit.

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.310
And the attention then can be enlightened by the Spirit.

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:31.101
So to know the knowledge of this root,

00:02:31.518 --> 00:02:37.852
you have to become something more than a human being.

00:02:38.185 --> 00:02:41.185
Even Darwin, who did not believe in God,

00:02:41.435 --> 00:02:46.602
did say very clearly, that if man has come so far,

00:02:47.018 --> 00:02:53.602
he has to go little further to explain himself.

00:02:54.393 --> 00:02:59.852
But as he did not try the knowledge of the roots,

00:03:00.143 --> 00:03:07.060
whatever he said, was about what he saw apparently, outside.

00:03:10.393 --> 00:03:18.310
To become the subtle has to be something very spontaneous.

00:03:19.143 --> 00:03:22.602
Has to be something very spontaneous.

00:03:22.894 --> 00:03:28.060
It cannot be done by thinking or by reading.

00:03:28.477 --> 00:03:32.602
Some people believe, that if we read, we will go to God,

00:03:32.976 --> 00:03:36.268
or if we think about God, we'll go to God.

00:03:36.644 --> 00:03:40.852
It's not true. If it was so,

00:03:41.226 --> 00:03:44.727
why did Christ say that you are to be born again?

00:03:44.934 --> 00:03:47.185
Why did all of them say that

00:03:47.393 --> 00:03:50.310
some transformation has to take place within you?

00:03:50.727 --> 00:03:54.477
Even Buddha has said that you have to get your Self-realisation.

00:03:54.727 --> 00:03:59.393
Without that He would not talk about God.

00:03:59.727 --> 00:04:05.934
So something has to happen within us to transform us.

00:04:06.518 --> 00:04:10.727
The other idea people have, is - beg your pardon?

00:04:10.934 --> 00:04:12.560
Sorry, we have to leave early.

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:16.934
All right, you come along tomorrow. All right? May God bless you.

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:26.769
So something has to happen within us which is spontaneous.

00:04:27.101 --> 00:04:34.602
Because if our spiritual ascent has been

00:04:37.477 --> 00:04:42.644
the result of a living process,

00:04:44.101 --> 00:04:49.894
the further movement has to be living again.

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:55.810
So we have to understand first point, logically we should understand

00:04:56.143 --> 00:04:59.310
what we should expect about Self-realisation,

00:04:59.518 --> 00:05:02.727
that it has to be spontaneous.

00:05:03.101 --> 00:05:06.060
You cannot work it out,

00:05:06.435 --> 00:05:13.226
you cannot become.

00:05:14.727 --> 00:05:17.894
You became human beings spontaneously,

00:05:18.185 --> 00:05:20.644
from amoeba stage to this stage.

00:05:20.894 --> 00:05:24.976
And if you have to become something more it has to be

00:05:25.393 --> 00:05:29.644
spontaneous by the force which resides within you.

00:05:29.894 --> 00:05:35.352
Like the force that resides in a seed,

00:05:35.644 --> 00:05:41.226
which spontaneously becomes

00:05:41.602 --> 00:05:48.060
germinated when it is put in the Mother Earth.

00:05:48.477 --> 00:05:50.935
If you read a book, you cannot do it.

00:05:51.143 --> 00:05:53.477
If you stand on your head, you can't do it.

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:57.060
If you jump, you do what you like, it's not going to happen.

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:02.226
You have to put it in the womb of the Mother Earth,

00:06:02.435 --> 00:06:05.143
so that the seed should be germinated.

00:06:05.352 --> 00:06:08.060
Is the capacity of the Mother Earth,

00:06:08.352 --> 00:06:10.560
is the quality of the Mother Earth,

00:06:10.769 --> 00:06:15.935
that gives that spontaneous germination to a seed.

00:06:16.185 --> 00:06:21.518
Now every day in life we see so many living things happening,

00:06:21.727 --> 00:06:27.644
like a flower becoming a fruit.

00:06:27.976 --> 00:06:31.101
But we take it for granted.

00:06:31.393 --> 00:06:36.934
We don't understand that we cannot transform a flower into a fruit.

00:06:37.226 --> 00:06:39.894
We cannot do anything that is living.

00:06:40.143 --> 00:06:42.727
What we can do is the dead work.

00:06:42.934 --> 00:06:47.268
If a tree dies, all right, so we make a beautiful furniture.

00:06:47.518 --> 00:06:51.976
Or something dead is converted into another form of dead,

00:06:52.352 --> 00:06:56.435
which also deaden us with habits.

00:06:56.934 --> 00:07:00.935
So the work of the Divine

00:07:01.143 --> 00:07:06.101
or the All Pervading Power of Love of God,

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:10.185
is living work of the living God.

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:14.352
And that power we know it exists

00:07:14.644 --> 00:07:16.769
but we are not aware of it

00:07:16.976 --> 00:07:21.934
and we cannot feel it on the central nervous system.

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:30.435
When people talk about the All Pervading Power, it's a mystery.

00:07:30.852 --> 00:07:34.310
They talk about the Holy Ghost. This is another mystery.

00:07:34.518 --> 00:07:36.477
Everything seems to be a mystery

00:07:36.685 --> 00:07:39.976
before you have got your Realisation.

00:07:40.226 --> 00:07:42.894
For example this instrument is made

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:47.185
and is not connected to the mains.

00:07:47.518 --> 00:07:49.934
It's a mystery. Nobody knows what is it for,

00:07:50.101 --> 00:07:52.727
what's the purpose of this instrument is.

00:07:52.934 --> 00:07:55.352
But once it is put to the mains,

00:07:55.560 --> 00:08:01.560
you start seeing how fantastic it is, how tremendous it is.

00:08:01.934 --> 00:08:06.101
One can't believe when they say that in Sahaja Yoga

00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:08.518
you receive all these powers of your own.

00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:13.268
One can't believe it, because they think, "How can it be possible?"

00:08:13.602 --> 00:08:18.810
But for your information, you are a fantastic being made by God.

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:20.769
And this is the instrument,

00:08:20.935 --> 00:08:24.477
that is lying within you in a subtle form.

00:08:24.934 --> 00:08:29.101
Now when I'm talking to you, you have to know one more thing,

00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:33.185
that you should keep an open mind to listen to Me,

00:08:33.435 --> 00:08:36.518
like a scientist does.

00:08:36.934 --> 00:08:40.769
It's a hypothesis for you and it's truth for Me.

00:08:40.976 --> 00:08:44.018
All right. If it is proofed to be truth for you

00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:49.352
then you should go forward with it and try to understand,

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:57.185
how the truth is being established  logically within you.

00:08:57.852 --> 00:09:03.268
At the very outset I've seen people have doubts about the Divine.

00:09:03.602 --> 00:09:06.143
They start asking, "Mother how is it possible,

00:09:06.435 --> 00:09:08.769
that we can get it so easily?

00:09:08.935 --> 00:09:12.477
How one can get realisation so easily?

00:09:12.685 --> 00:09:16.268
We have to cleanse it, we have to suffer, we have to do this."

00:09:16.602 --> 00:09:24.352
Perhaps you do not know, that when we use an electric switch,

00:09:24.976 --> 00:09:30.185
we do not think, what has gone in the history,

00:09:30.477 --> 00:09:32.976
what people have suffered in the history

00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:37.185
in creating that little switch.

00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:42.602
It has taken ages for this switch to come up,

00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:48.185
to discover the electricity, the working of it and the whole, whole

00:09:48.393 --> 00:09:52.769
development of electrical appliances, till we got the switch.

00:09:53.018 --> 00:09:57.435
Now we only know we have to switch on and we get the lights.

00:09:57.852 --> 00:10:01.185
But when I say that you don't have to do anything else,

00:10:01.393 --> 00:10:02.477
you are not to suffer,

00:10:02.685 --> 00:10:07.101
you must know somebody has suffered for you on the cross.

00:10:07.602 --> 00:10:10.894
Somebody has done the cleansing part of it,

00:10:11.101 --> 00:10:17.477
and you cannot cleanse yourself unless and until you are out of it.

00:10:18.226 --> 00:10:22.934
If you have to cleanse your car, you have to get out of it.

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:27.894
That is why first of all you must get your Self-realisation,

00:10:28.101 --> 00:10:35.477
the light of your being, the purpose of your life, the absolute.

00:10:35.727 --> 00:10:38.644
She has already explained to you the chart,

00:10:38.934 --> 00:10:43.935
that is the instrument, the subtle instrument that is within you.

00:10:44.185 --> 00:10:48.226
Now here the chart is showing you all the different centers,

00:10:48.435 --> 00:10:55.602
but these centers are manifested also in the gross as plexuses.

00:10:55.976 --> 00:10:59.935
We have first of all the Mooladhara chakra.

00:11:00.185 --> 00:11:06.060
This chakra is the center which controls actually the pelvic plexus,

00:11:06.352 --> 00:11:09.934
through which all our excretion takes place.

00:11:10.226 --> 00:11:13.435
It's a very important center, Mooladhara,

00:11:13.644 --> 00:11:16.602
means the support of the root.

00:11:16.852 --> 00:11:19.727
Is the support of the root, is the center

00:11:19.934 --> 00:11:22.894
of the support of the root.

00:11:23.101 --> 00:11:26.226
Is a very, very important center, because

00:11:26.477 --> 00:11:30.268
this represents our innocence.

00:11:30.644 --> 00:11:34.310
In the subtle it is the innocence in us,

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:39.185
which looks after this center.

00:11:39.727 --> 00:11:44.226
Through our ignorance or through our naiveness,

00:11:44.477 --> 00:11:46.310
we loose our innocence.

00:11:46.644 --> 00:11:49.101
But actually innocence can never be lost,

00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:55.602
only it is tarnished or covered by our stupidity maybe,

00:11:55.810 --> 00:11:58.352
by our wrong doings to ourselves.

00:11:58.602 --> 00:12:00.727
It exists all the time,

00:12:00.934 --> 00:12:04.226
and when the Kundalini rises which is above that,

00:12:04.602 --> 00:12:08.185
which is coiled up into three and a half coils,

00:12:08.393 --> 00:12:11.226
this chakra becomes aware of itself.

00:12:11.435 --> 00:12:15.727
The deity of innocence within it gets awakened

00:12:15.934 --> 00:12:22.560
and one starts feeling the innocence within one's personality.

00:12:22.976 --> 00:12:28.226
The Kundalini itself, this residual power of desire,

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:31.352
is placed in the triangular bone.

00:12:31.644 --> 00:12:36.435
The triangular bone is the bone called as sacrum.

00:12:36.769 --> 00:12:39.268
It's a Greek word, meaning sacred.

00:12:39.518 --> 00:12:43.894
So the Greek knew that this

00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:47.226
triangular bone contained something sacred.

00:12:47.477 --> 00:12:49.226
And when I went to Greece and asked them,

00:12:49.435 --> 00:12:51.060
"How is it you call it sacrum?",

00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:55.393
they said, "There has been a report, Indo-Aryan report,

00:12:55.602 --> 00:12:59.560
much before Alexander, where we came to know about this bone,

00:12:59.810 --> 00:13:05.477
that it is a sacred bone and it has a special power within it."

00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:11.018
Now this Kundalini is a power which is the pure desire,

00:13:11.435 --> 00:13:14.060
is the power of pure desire.

00:13:14.268 --> 00:13:17.352
While the other, if you see the blue line,

00:13:17.644 --> 00:13:21.310
the left side power within us,

00:13:21.518 --> 00:13:25.934
which starts from the right at the back and goes to the left,

00:13:26.185 --> 00:13:30.018
is the power of desire.

00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:35.310
But not pure desire, because this can be made impured.

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:41.810
And all other desires but the desire to be one with the Divine,

00:13:41.976 --> 00:13:46.810
are corruptible, can be wrong, can be confusing.

00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:51.226
As you know in economics it is said, that

00:13:51.435 --> 00:13:54.310
no desire is satiable in general,

00:13:54.518 --> 00:13:56.644
because you want to buy a house, you want to buy a car,

00:13:56.852 --> 00:13:59.185
then you want to buy that and you buy another thing.

00:13:59.393 --> 00:14:01.769
You are never satisfied with matter.

00:14:02.101 --> 00:14:06.268
So this desire which is lying in the sacrum bone

00:14:06.477 --> 00:14:08.644
absolutely in its pure form,

00:14:08.934 --> 00:14:11.727
the pure desire to be one with the Divine,

00:14:11.934 --> 00:14:17.143
is the one that gives you ultimate satisfaction and joy.

00:14:17.644 --> 00:14:21.602
It is so spontaneous, that if people ask Me, "How You do it?",

00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:26.060
is going to be difficult to explain at this level how it is done.

00:14:26.393 --> 00:14:29.894
As you cannot explain how a seed germinates

00:14:30.143 --> 00:14:32.018
and how it becomes a tree.

00:14:32.226 --> 00:14:34.644
All living things cannot be explained,

00:14:34.852 --> 00:14:39.769
only to be seen and to be felt within yourself.

00:14:41.435 --> 00:14:45.268
I will be able to tell you tomorrow more about these centers,

00:14:45.477 --> 00:14:48.268
what are these centers and what are they related to you.

00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:51.018
In any case I hope you have the books now and

00:14:51.226 --> 00:14:56.518
when you go, you can take these books with you and read them at home

00:14:56.727 --> 00:15:00.143
and see for yourself, if you can understand,

00:15:00.352 --> 00:15:02.143
what's written in those books.

00:15:02.393 --> 00:15:06.185
But here today as an introduction, I would like to tell you

00:15:06.393 --> 00:15:09.185
certain questions all these people have in their mind.

00:15:09.393 --> 00:15:13.518
For example there have been many fake gurus coming from India

00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:16.894
and they have been enticing many people abroad.

00:15:17.101 --> 00:15:20.226
And most of the newspaper people ask Me about them.

00:15:20.477 --> 00:15:26.685
So I have to tell that you of course can blame these fake gurus,

00:15:26.894 --> 00:15:29.644
no doubt, that they are sinister, they have been devilish,

00:15:29.894 --> 00:15:31.894
they have been money oriented, I agree.

00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:36.185
But also that a seeker has to use his brains

00:15:36.518 --> 00:15:38.934
and must understand, what he is seeking.

00:15:39.143 --> 00:15:43.894
If we just blind folded go to these gurus, then

00:15:44.101 --> 00:15:48.185
what can one do about it? It's very sad, because they are so naive,

00:15:48.393 --> 00:15:52.060
they must understand what we are seeking, what we are expecting,

00:15:52.268 --> 00:15:55.518
and what should happen to us.

00:15:57.060 --> 00:16:05.060
Now, some people don't understand that you cannot pay for God.

00:16:06.393 --> 00:16:09.602
You have not paid anything for becoming a human being.

00:16:09.894 --> 00:16:11.268
He doesn't understand money.

00:16:11.518 --> 00:16:14.101
Money is created only by human beings.

00:16:14.352 --> 00:16:17.935
God has not created money. He doesn't understand money at all.

00:16:18.143 --> 00:16:22.310
You cannot purchase God, you cannot purchase this knowledge,

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:24.518
you cannot purchase your realisation.

00:16:24.727 --> 00:16:27.435
None of the things that are related with God,

00:16:27.685 --> 00:16:29.769
can be purchased with money.

00:16:29.935 --> 00:16:33.101
Anybody who tries to take money from you,

00:16:33.310 --> 00:16:35.393
in the name of God, is a parasite.

00:16:35.685 --> 00:16:40.935
Not only a parasite,

00:16:41.310 --> 00:16:47.268
but I would say a person who is anti-God.

00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:51.352
Because that is how he is maligning the name of God.

00:16:51.769 --> 00:16:57.894
It cannot be purchased, it cannot be sold, it cannot be organised,

00:16:58.185 --> 00:16:59.934
it cannot be manoeuvred.

00:17:00.185 --> 00:17:04.560
We cannot have aa organisation of God.

00:17:04.769 --> 00:17:09.268
We cannot organise Him. He is the way He is.

00:17:09.518 --> 00:17:12.810
We cannot tell Him now, "You come along every Sunday to our church".

00:17:12.976 --> 00:17:17.268
He won't. It is His desire, if He wants to do it

00:17:17.602 --> 00:17:19.268
or if He doesn't want to do it.

00:17:19.477 --> 00:17:25.685
The only thing that binds God is love, dedication and truthfulness.

00:17:25.894 --> 00:17:28.560
If you are truthful, if you are dedicated,

00:17:28.769 --> 00:17:30.518
then God is interested in you.

00:17:30.769 --> 00:17:34.143
If you are not, He is not at all interested in people,

00:17:34.352 --> 00:17:38.060
who are seeking not God but something else.

00:17:38.352 --> 00:17:42.934
But what is most unfortunate, that the people who are mislaid,

00:17:43.101 --> 00:17:45.477
are all seekers of God.

00:17:45.685 --> 00:17:48.810
They are all seekers of truth, they are true people,

00:17:48.976 --> 00:17:52.934
they are honest, they are dedicated and they are exploited.

00:17:53.101 --> 00:17:57.810
So again I would say, anybody who takes money in the name of God,

00:17:57.976 --> 00:18:01.185
please see that, that is not God, please!

00:18:01.393 --> 00:18:04.310
As a Mother I'm warning you, that one has to understand,

00:18:04.518 --> 00:18:08.602
any saint who takes money in the name of God is

00:18:08.810 --> 00:18:13.934
not a person, who is to be regarded as a divine personality,

00:18:14.268 --> 00:18:16.185
by no chance a saint.

00:18:16.435 --> 00:18:19.976
Now secondly, as I told you, you cannot put in an effort,

00:18:20.185 --> 00:18:22.769
it is a spontaneous happening.

00:18:22.935 --> 00:18:27.018
Now one of the arguments people have, that in such and such book,

00:18:27.226 --> 00:18:29.435
X, Y, Z this is written.

00:18:29.644 --> 00:18:33.602
In the other book so and so, this is written.

00:18:33.934 --> 00:18:38.934
Another fellow who was such and such has said so.

00:18:39.226 --> 00:18:43.935
It's very easy to dwell upon such sayings and on such books.

00:18:44.226 --> 00:18:49.185
I would request you to be here at this moment with Me,

00:18:49.435 --> 00:18:51.435
to understand what I have to say.

00:18:51.685 --> 00:18:52.894
If you bring in other people,

00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:55.310
I'll have to tell you the facts about them,

00:18:55.518 --> 00:18:57.852
which you may not like, which will not be palatable.

00:18:58.060 --> 00:19:00.185
We'll create a controversy for nothing at all.

00:19:00.393 --> 00:19:03.560
Because we are not here to create any controversies.

00:19:03.852 --> 00:19:06.685
We are here to achieve our goal of Self-realisation

00:19:06.894 --> 00:19:08.894
for our betterment.

00:19:09.268 --> 00:19:13.894
Once you understand this, that the main interest is of the Divine

00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:19.018
and that is, that you all should get your Self-realisation.

00:19:19.393 --> 00:19:22.310
We have known that we have become human beings.

00:19:22.518 --> 00:19:25.727
But we have never asked a question, no scientist has asked a question:

00:19:25.935 --> 00:19:28.268
Why have we become a human being?

00:19:28.518 --> 00:19:30.810
Why are we on this earth moving

00:19:30.976 --> 00:19:33.101
with these two legs and two feet in this fashion?

00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:37.477
What is the speciality, why God has made us

00:19:37.769 --> 00:19:41.101
in such a beautiful way, that we are called as human beings?

00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:44.352
If you ask this question to yourself, you won't be able to say

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:48.352
that there is any purpose in what God has done to us.

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:50.435
But I say, there is a purpose!

00:19:50.644 --> 00:19:54.018
The purpose is that you have to become the instrument of God.

00:19:54.310 --> 00:20:00.352
You have to become the carrier of His power.

00:20:00.727 --> 00:20:05.934
When the Kundalini rises and breaks through your seventh chakra here,

00:20:06.185 --> 00:20:09.644
then it is amazing how you feel this All Pervading Power

00:20:09.852 --> 00:20:13.018
as cool breeze in your hands. But that's not sufficient.

00:20:13.226 --> 00:20:15.894
If you feel the cool breeze, supposing I give you a car

00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:21.143
or any instrument and I don't tell you how to drive, it is useless.

00:20:21.393 --> 00:20:25.602
But if you learn the complete decoding of this feeling

00:20:25.810 --> 00:20:30.685
of this All Pervading Power, you can do great things,

00:20:30.934 --> 00:20:33.310
because God has put these powers within you,

00:20:33.518 --> 00:20:35.935
only the light has to come in.

00:20:36.185 --> 00:20:38.934
Without the light as you cannot see anything properly,

00:20:39.101 --> 00:20:41.727
you cannot integrate anything, correlate anything.

00:20:41.934 --> 00:20:45.727
In the same way, when there is no light within yourself,

00:20:45.934 --> 00:20:52.352
you are not integrated within, nor you understand absolute things.

00:20:52.602 --> 00:20:55.352
What you understand are relative things.

00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:59.185
With our mind projection whatever we do is all relative.

00:20:59.435 --> 00:21:03.060
That's why we are having problems about our politics,

00:21:03.268 --> 00:21:08.934
about our economics, about our every sort of thing that we are doing.

00:21:09.435 --> 00:21:13.976
Our development also has been very one-sided in the sense,

00:21:14.185 --> 00:21:16.934
that our material development has taken place

00:21:17.101 --> 00:21:19.101
without the Spirit in it.

00:21:19.352 --> 00:21:22.685
Anything without the Spirit is something like a tree

00:21:22.894 --> 00:21:27.393
growing, outgrowing it's size much more than the roots

00:21:27.602 --> 00:21:32.143
and that's how sometimes we always are worried and shocked

00:21:32.393 --> 00:21:38.185
at the destruction, that is facing us from within and without.

00:21:38.393 --> 00:21:42.101
We see diseases like cancer and other horrible diseases,

00:21:42.352 --> 00:21:43.810
which we cannot combat.

00:21:43.976 --> 00:21:49.268
We see the problems of the nations and political, economic crises,

00:21:49.518 --> 00:21:53.602
and we don't understand how to control it on individual basis.

00:21:53.852 --> 00:21:58.226
All these things can only be solved if you become the Spirit.

00:21:58.435 --> 00:22:03.310
The Spirit is within you the link with the whole.

00:22:03.602 --> 00:22:07.934
Like the microcosm, the whole, you are a part and parcel of that.

00:22:08.101 --> 00:22:10.644
Like my finger is part and parcel of the whole.

00:22:10.894 --> 00:22:14.935
Now, if there is pain in my finger, I can feel the whole.

00:22:15.143 --> 00:22:18.226
In the same way once I become aware of My Spirit,

00:22:18.477 --> 00:22:22.352
I can feel the whole, I become collectively conscious.

00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:25.727
I do not talk about it, I do not say that

00:22:25.934 --> 00:22:29.477
'You are now brothers and sisters', but it just happens that

00:22:29.685 --> 00:22:33.310
on your fingertips you start feeling others, very clearly,

00:22:33.518 --> 00:22:35.976
their centres, their problems, your problems

00:22:36.185 --> 00:22:40.185
and also you know methods how to clear it out.

00:22:40.393 --> 00:22:43.143
Compassion people talk of, of giving compassion,

00:22:43.352 --> 00:22:45.769
looking after people and doing good to them.

00:22:46.018 --> 00:22:50.143
But this compassion talks, it doesn't solve the problem.

00:22:50.352 --> 00:22:54.393
But the compassion that flows from you, works. It works out.

00:22:54.644 --> 00:22:58.644
It helps people in a way that they are not aware of it.

00:22:58.852 --> 00:23:01.852
For example in India we had one Indian,

00:23:02.018 --> 00:23:03.685
who got realisation in a village.

00:23:03.894 --> 00:23:05.935
He was a farmer, he went back,

00:23:06.143 --> 00:23:10.518
and he gave realisation to so many people, and it is unbelievable,

00:23:10.727 --> 00:23:17.226
how he could manage such a lot of population to come to Sahaja Yoga.

00:23:17.477 --> 00:23:19.602
But he told Me that certain incidents

00:23:19.810 --> 00:23:26.018
like, 'A man came to me and he was an alcoholic,

00:23:26.352 --> 00:23:29.352
and he came to me and he was about to beat me.

00:23:29.602 --> 00:23:31.810
But I was very quiet. I just told him,

00:23:31.976 --> 00:23:34.060
"Now don't beat me, you sit down for a while".

00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:37.976
He sat down and after some time, I awakened his Kundalini.

00:23:38.185 --> 00:23:40.852
Overnight he gave up alcohol!

00:23:41.185 --> 00:23:42.727
Overnight he gave it up.

00:23:42.934 --> 00:23:44.810
He became like a king. He said, "What?

00:23:44.976 --> 00:23:46.685
I'm not going to drink anymore".'

00:23:46.894 --> 00:23:52.310
It's not mental, but just he achieved his supreme thing,

00:23:52.644 --> 00:23:59.435
the highest thing, his purpose and the whole being got glorified.

00:23:59.644 --> 00:24:03.268
So you start feeling your own powers.

00:24:03.477 --> 00:24:06.810
Actually when you go to any guru, you must also find out

00:24:06.976 --> 00:24:10.894
from the disciples, if they have achieved any powers or not.

00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:13.769
It is not important if a guru says, "I am such and such".

00:24:13.935 --> 00:24:18.644
For example, the lady who came to interview Me, she said,

00:24:18.852 --> 00:24:22.143
"Do You think you are the highest saint of India?" and all that.

00:24:22.352 --> 00:24:26.352
I said, "I never said so. But the saints in India do say so."

00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:29.226
All right. If you believe in it or not makes no difference.

00:24:29.477 --> 00:24:32.226
It is for you to find out. But leave alone Me,

00:24:32.435 --> 00:24:35.352
why not find out about yourself, what happens to you.

00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:40.143
Supposing you become the saint, supposing you have the powers,

00:24:40.352 --> 00:24:43.310
supposing you manifest that compassion which I am talking of,

00:24:43.518 --> 00:24:46.727
then you have to believe that there is something about yourself.

00:24:46.934 --> 00:24:49.435
First of all you all must have faith in yourselves,

00:24:49.644 --> 00:24:53.352
that you are capable of becoming that Self,

00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:57.226
which is collectively conscious to begin with,

00:24:57.602 --> 00:25:02.852
which is the source of all the joy, health, wealth

00:25:03.018 --> 00:25:05.769
and all kinds of satisfaction,

00:25:06.018 --> 00:25:10.393
and the one which is the witness of the play of Divine,

00:25:10.602 --> 00:25:16.685
the one that allows you to transmit this Divine power to others.

00:25:16.934 --> 00:25:20.185
After realisation, for example Dr. Warren himself

00:25:20.477 --> 00:25:22.685
was very reluctant in the beginning.

00:25:22.894 --> 00:25:25.143
He was a difficult person to begin with.

00:25:25.352 --> 00:25:27.018
Then he got his realisation

00:25:27.226 --> 00:25:30.060
and after realisation he was quite satisfied.

00:25:30.268 --> 00:25:32.060
Because he had been to so many gurus.

00:25:32.268 --> 00:25:34.060
There's no guru he had not been.

00:25:34.268 --> 00:25:41.101
And he was so angry and aggressive when he came to Sahaja Yoga.

00:25:41.352 --> 00:25:46.393
When he got into realisation, he just felt that he has found it.

00:25:46.644 --> 00:25:50.560
Now, through him in Australia we have established

00:25:50.769 --> 00:25:54.101
so many centres, and so many people have got realisation.

00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:56.894
It's a surprising thing that one man,

00:25:57.060 --> 00:26:00.976
who reluctantly came to Me on a telephone number,

00:26:01.268 --> 00:26:04.769
has suddenly become such an enlightened person,

00:26:04.935 --> 00:26:08.560
that he has given realisation to so many people,

00:26:08.852 --> 00:26:11.852
and to whom he has given realisation, have

00:26:12.018 --> 00:26:14.685
also given Realisation to so many others.

00:26:14.894 --> 00:26:18.810
Apart from that they have cured diseases like cancer

00:26:18.976 --> 00:26:23.477
and all kinds of serious diseases we talk about. It's a fact.

00:26:23.685 --> 00:26:27.185
For this you cannot pay. That's one thing for sure.

00:26:27.393 --> 00:26:29.393
You cannot pay for it. It's all free.

00:26:29.602 --> 00:26:32.934
As this nature is free to give you everything

00:26:33.101 --> 00:26:35.727
that is essential and vital within you.

00:26:35.934 --> 00:26:41.060
In the same way this knowledge has to be without any effort.

00:26:41.310 --> 00:26:45.018
Supposing if we have to learn about breathing,

00:26:45.226 --> 00:26:49.018
going to a library, how many of us would survive?

00:26:49.268 --> 00:26:53.018
It is so vital that it has to be the easiest, the simplest

00:26:53.226 --> 00:26:56.185
and everything that is living is so simple,

00:26:56.393 --> 00:27:00.185
that we don't also bother to think about it.

00:27:00.393 --> 00:27:04.435
We take all this for granted.

00:27:05.268 --> 00:27:08.602
The subject is very wide.

00:27:08.934 --> 00:27:11.435
It has many aspects and dimensions.

00:27:11.644 --> 00:27:15.976
First when the Kundalini rises, it crosses through this center,

00:27:16.226 --> 00:27:18.727
which is called as the Agnya chakra,

00:27:18.934 --> 00:27:23.518
which is the chakra of our Lord Jesus Christ.

00:27:23.727 --> 00:27:26.226
Tomorrow I'll be telling you the names of all the deities,

00:27:26.435 --> 00:27:28.435
who reside on these centers.

00:27:28.644 --> 00:27:31.060
Now it is difficult for a scientist to accept,

00:27:31.268 --> 00:27:35.310
that there are deities who are sitting on these chakras.

00:27:35.518 --> 00:27:39.727
But Socrates and Confucius who were such ancient people,

00:27:39.934 --> 00:27:43.727
have talked about these Gods, that we have to keep them pleased

00:27:43.935 --> 00:27:45.810
and you have to keep them all right.

00:27:45.976 --> 00:27:48.518
But those realised souls perhaps you don't know.

00:27:48.727 --> 00:27:53.310
That's not easy to convince human beings who are not realised souls

00:27:53.518 --> 00:27:57.935
about these deities being within you.

00:27:58.268 --> 00:28:00.976
And they are all just waiting there.

00:28:01.226 --> 00:28:06.727
As soon as the Kundalini rises you start manifesting your grandeur,

00:28:06.934 --> 00:28:09.852
your great personality that awaits you.

00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:13.602
This is something not fantastic to Me,

00:28:13.810 --> 00:28:17.852
because I've seen thousands of people getting realisation,

00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:20.644
thousands of them feeling the cool breeze,

00:28:20.934 --> 00:28:23.393
thousands of them transforming.

00:28:23.644 --> 00:28:26.644
Another thing one has to see in a person, in a guru,

00:28:26.852 --> 00:28:28.976
when you go to a guru, that

00:28:29.185 --> 00:28:32.935
'Is this the man giving any transformation to another person?'

00:28:33.143 --> 00:28:36.352
Here they are, they are smuggling, they are telling lies,

00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:38.518
they are killing people and they have a guru.

00:28:38.727 --> 00:28:39.810
How can you have a guru,

00:28:39.976 --> 00:28:43.101
when you are doing all these anti-God activities?

00:28:43.310 --> 00:28:45.393
All kinds of anti-God activities they are doing:

00:28:45.602 --> 00:28:51.143
They are hot-tempered, they are liars, they are intriguers,

00:28:51.393 --> 00:28:53.685
all sorts of things they'll be doing

00:28:53.894 --> 00:28:56.727
and they will be saying that "We have a guru".

00:28:56.935 --> 00:28:59.810
What's the use of such a guru, who allows you to do these things?

00:28:59.976 --> 00:29:02.769
It's better not to have such a guru who allows you to do that.

00:29:02.976 --> 00:29:05.810
Secondly, a guru if you have a real one,

00:29:05.976 --> 00:29:08.935
he has to look after your health, minimum of minimum.

00:29:09.143 --> 00:29:12.310
But if you go to a guru and if you get epilepsy

00:29:12.518 --> 00:29:15.644
or if you go to a guru and you get a bad head

00:29:15.852 --> 00:29:18.101
or some sort of a headache, then he says,

00:29:18.310 --> 00:29:20.976
"All right, these are your sins, you better suffer".

00:29:21.185 --> 00:29:23.060
So one should ask a question to such a guru,

00:29:23.268 --> 00:29:27.518
that, "Then why are you there? Why are we paying you for?

00:29:27.727 --> 00:29:31.143
If you can't even look after our health,what are we paying you for?"

00:29:31.352 --> 00:29:34.226
There could be a guru who can teach you something,

00:29:34.435 --> 00:29:36.477
like he'll say that, "I'll make you fly".

00:29:36.685 --> 00:29:38.810
So you must ask the guru to fly himself.

00:29:39.018 --> 00:29:41.101
If the guru can fly, then you pay him.

00:29:41.310 --> 00:29:43.894
What's the use of paying a guru who just says, you can fly.

00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:46.769
"All right, you give me six thousand pounds, I'll make you fly."

00:29:46.935 --> 00:29:49.852
Better ask the guru to fly and see that he flies.

00:29:50.018 --> 00:29:52.477
But people are so identified with the gurus,

00:29:52.685 --> 00:29:56.518
that despite they become absolutely bankrupt, finished,

00:29:56.727 --> 00:29:59.644
gone cases, still they are sticking on to these gurus,

00:29:59.934 --> 00:30:00.935
because they are mesmerised.

00:30:01.143 --> 00:30:03.935
They don't want to have their own Self-realisation,

00:30:04.143 --> 00:30:06.185
they don't want to have their own powers,

00:30:06.393 --> 00:30:09.810
but they want to abide by the so-called powers of their guru

00:30:09.976 --> 00:30:13.685
and all these things. They become absolutely hopeless cases,

00:30:13.934 --> 00:30:16.852
gone cases, good for nothing, lost people,

00:30:17.018 --> 00:30:20.185
but still they'll stick on to these people and

00:30:20.393 --> 00:30:24.352
will continue with it till they are perished as useless cabbages.

00:30:24.602 --> 00:30:27.602
It's a very common thing, I've seen of some of the people

00:30:27.810 --> 00:30:30.310
who teach that you must starve now, you must starve.

00:30:30.518 --> 00:30:31.727
And the guru eats well,

00:30:31.934 --> 00:30:34.518
but all the disciples are starving and suffering.

00:30:34.727 --> 00:30:36.268
There's one thing more in Sahaja Yoga,

00:30:36.477 --> 00:30:38.602
you are not supposed to suffer anymore.

00:30:38.934 --> 00:30:42.101
There's no need to suffer.

00:30:43.143 --> 00:30:45.560
Christ has suffered. He has suffered for us.

00:30:45.810 --> 00:30:48.769
Now, no more suffering is needed for anyone of you.

00:30:48.935 --> 00:30:52.518
Tomorrow I'll tell you how, when Christ is awakened,

00:30:52.810 --> 00:30:55.018
you can feel

00:30:55.268 --> 00:30:58.644
your so-called karmas and your so-called

00:30:58.852 --> 00:31:01.101
egos and all that just are sucked in.

00:31:01.310 --> 00:31:06.976
Here as you will see, ego is created with this right side power

00:31:07.185 --> 00:31:12.393
called as the kriya shakti, is the power of action.

00:31:12.769 --> 00:31:16.727
And when it moves further and further and touches the other side

00:31:16.934 --> 00:31:19.393
which is the superego, then

00:31:19.602 --> 00:31:22.435
in the center here, on the fontanel bone area,

00:31:22.644 --> 00:31:24.685
a calcification takes place.

00:31:24.894 --> 00:31:27.976
And when that happens you develop your I-ness.

00:31:28.185 --> 00:31:33.602
You become "I", Mr." I", Mr."Second I", Mr. "Third I".

00:31:33.852 --> 00:31:37.393
Now, this is like an egg we can say,

00:31:37.602 --> 00:31:39.934
which has to be transformed into a bird.

00:31:40.101 --> 00:31:45.143
In Sanskrit a realised soul is called as 'vijaha', means twice born.

00:31:45.393 --> 00:31:48.560
And also a bird is called as twice-born.

00:31:48.769 --> 00:31:53.810
In the same way a human being which looks so insipid, so boring,

00:31:53.976 --> 00:31:57.185
so useless, sometimes he also condemns himself for nothing at all,

00:31:57.393 --> 00:32:00.602
sometimes you find him so bombastic, so egoistical,

00:32:00.685 --> 00:32:03.352
so horrible, so aggressive.

00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:06.518
All these people are nothing but these little eggs.

00:32:06.727 --> 00:32:11.935
Only thing what one has to do is to transform them into the bird.

00:32:12.185 --> 00:32:14.934
The bird, that is a free bird,

00:32:15.143 --> 00:32:18.769
which understands what is wrong with you,

00:32:18.935 --> 00:32:22.352
what is wrong with others and how to correct yourself.

00:32:22.602 --> 00:32:25.934
Because the Spirit is the master, is the guru.

00:32:26.101 --> 00:32:29.727
Your Spirit is your master. You are your own master.

00:32:29.934 --> 00:32:31.769
You become your own master

00:32:31.935 --> 00:32:35.477
and you start understanding everything one by one.

00:32:35.685 --> 00:32:38.060
I am just your Mother. I'll decode for you,

00:32:38.268 --> 00:32:40.810
I'll tell you what is what, what is this.

00:32:40.976 --> 00:32:45.101
Once you understand that and you start finding it out,

00:32:45.310 --> 00:32:47.393
you yourself will be amazed, that

00:32:47.602 --> 00:32:49.685
not only that you can cure yourself,

00:32:49.894 --> 00:32:51.435
you can raise your own Kundalini,

00:32:51.644 --> 00:32:53.477
you can work it out on yourself

00:32:53.685 --> 00:32:56.518
and keep your transformation moving further and further,

00:32:56.727 --> 00:33:00.935
but you become entitled, endowed with powers,

00:33:01.143 --> 00:33:03.352
that you can give realisations to others,

00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:06.644
you can do all these things by yourself,

00:33:06.894 --> 00:33:09.810
and it is such a remarkable thing, which must be achieved.

00:33:09.976 --> 00:33:13.727
Because if you see the condition of this world today,

00:33:13.934 --> 00:33:15.310
it is in a very big mess.

00:33:15.518 --> 00:33:19.393
I don't know if people understand it what we are facing.

00:33:19.602 --> 00:33:23.810
We are just like the tree as I told you, which has lost his roots,

00:33:23.976 --> 00:33:26.644
and anytime it can be destroyed.

00:33:26.894 --> 00:33:30.769
It is very important today that all of us must seek

00:33:30.935 --> 00:33:33.393
and find the Spirit.

00:33:33.644 --> 00:33:37.185
Everybody who has told this, they were not liars,

00:33:37.393 --> 00:33:39.185
they are not telling us wrong things.

00:33:39.393 --> 00:33:42.393
Traditionally everyone has said the same thing.

00:33:42.602 --> 00:33:46.101
Now these gurus can also start some untraditional stuff,

00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:49.268
and people believe it, because it is something new.

00:33:49.518 --> 00:33:53.018
This is the higher evolution of a person

00:33:53.226 --> 00:33:56.310
where you arrive at a point,

00:33:56.518 --> 00:34:00.976
where you become the witness of the play of the whole game.

00:34:01.185 --> 00:34:03.644
For example a thought rises and falls off,

00:34:03.852 --> 00:34:05.934
another thought rises and falls off.

00:34:06.101 --> 00:34:08.560
Between these thoughts there is a little space

00:34:08.769 --> 00:34:10.852
and this space is the present,

00:34:11.018 --> 00:34:14.268
while we live in the present or the past.

00:34:14.477 --> 00:34:20.934
But - we live in the present, we don't live in the present,

00:34:21.143 --> 00:34:23.560
but we live in the future or in the past.

00:34:23.769 --> 00:34:26.644
Now the past doesn't exist, because it's over,

00:34:26.852 --> 00:34:28.560
and the present (should be FUTURE) doesn't exist at all.

00:34:28.769 --> 00:34:31.727
So our thoughts are all the time moving like that.

00:34:31.934 --> 00:34:37.060
If somehow you can stop yourself at the point that is the present,

00:34:37.518 --> 00:34:42.894
then you start enjoying the dynamics of every moment which you live.

00:34:43.143 --> 00:34:46.477
And that's what is achieved through Kundalini awakening.

00:34:46.727 --> 00:34:49.644
As I told you this subject matter is very great.

00:34:49.852 --> 00:34:54.894
In an introduction I have tried to cover lots of points,

00:34:55.060 --> 00:34:57.976
which people have been asking Me all over the world.

00:34:58.185 --> 00:35:00.268
And if you have any new points to ask Me,

00:35:00.477 --> 00:35:02.894
I'll be very happy to answer you.

00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:04.935
Tomorrow I'll tell you actually

00:35:05.143 --> 00:35:07.435
what happens, when the Kundalini rises.

00:35:07.644 --> 00:35:10.018
I would like you to
ask Me questions

00:35:10.226 --> 00:35:14.018
and after that we will have the session of realisation,

00:35:14.226 --> 00:35:16.727
which may take hardly ten to fifteen minutes.

00:35:17.018 --> 00:35:19.810
May God bless you all.

00:35:20.602 --> 00:35:24.644
Can I have questions from you?

00:35:39.226 --> 00:35:42.060
You have a question? Anyone with questions...

00:35:42.393 --> 00:35:45.644
This is the best way to openly talk.

00:35:45.976 --> 00:35:49.685
Did You say the mind is the Spirit?

00:35:49.934 --> 00:35:51.810
Did You say the mind is the Spirit?

00:35:51.976 --> 00:35:54.352
No, tomorrow I'll tell you the difference,

00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:59.685
but if you want I tell you mind and Spirit are two different things.

00:36:02.894 --> 00:36:08.018
In English language what we call mind it's a confusing thing.

00:36:08.226 --> 00:36:12.393
But it's simple to understand.

00:36:12.976 --> 00:36:18.143
Now here you see is an institution,

00:36:18.393 --> 00:36:23.310
which looks like a blue balloon in the head.

00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:26.560
That is the mind.

00:36:26.934 --> 00:36:33.852
It is created by the action of the power of desire.

00:36:34.185 --> 00:36:37.894
which we call in psychology as superego,

00:36:38.185 --> 00:36:41.934
which is the result of all our conditionings, is the mind.

00:36:42.143 --> 00:36:45.560
You can call it manasa. In Sanskrit language is manasa.

00:36:45.769 --> 00:36:51.852
Now on the right side, the yellow coloured line, you see,

00:36:52.018 --> 00:36:56.644
ends up into another yellow coloured institution,

00:36:56.852 --> 00:37:02.976
is a result or a by-product of our activity,

00:37:03.435 --> 00:37:09.602
physical and through our brain, which we call as mental.

00:37:09.852 --> 00:37:14.060
This creates an institution called ego.

00:37:14.393 --> 00:37:18.101
So we have got superego as well as ego.

00:37:18.352 --> 00:37:21.226
Supposing you tell somebody, "Don't do like this.

00:37:21.435 --> 00:37:24.935
It is not to be done. You have to be disciplined like that."

00:37:25.185 --> 00:37:27.226
Then, if you go too much with it,

00:37:27.435 --> 00:37:29.644
then conditioning takes place in a person.

00:37:29.852 --> 00:37:34.976
And these conditionings are expressed as a balloon there,

00:37:35.435 --> 00:37:38.518
which is a by-product of conditionings.

00:37:38.852 --> 00:37:43.435
And the another one is the by-product of our activity,

00:37:43.894 --> 00:37:47.143
which is mental as well as physical.

00:37:47.435 --> 00:37:52.852
So we have two things, one is the manasa, is mana.

00:37:53.060 --> 00:37:56.644
I don't know, in English it is called as mind,

00:37:56.852 --> 00:38:02.101
but it is confusion, because they call a mental case to a mad man and

00:38:02.352 --> 00:38:05.894
when you work through your brain, you call it a mental activity.

00:38:06.060 --> 00:38:11.310
So I would suggest, that if the confusion has to be understood,

00:38:11.518 --> 00:38:13.644
has to be understood properly.

00:38:13.852 --> 00:38:18.810
What happens to a man who works through his brain too much,

00:38:19.060 --> 00:38:20.560
gets a heart attack.

00:38:20.769 --> 00:38:23.976
It's surprising, he should get something wrong there -

00:38:24.185 --> 00:38:26.185
but no, he gets a heart attack.

00:38:26.393 --> 00:38:30.644
A man, who works for the future through his mental capacity,

00:38:30.852 --> 00:38:33.310
gets a heart attack, means a balance.

00:38:33.518 --> 00:38:38.685
And then a man, who works with his emotions too much,

00:38:38.935 --> 00:38:44.393
gets this brain which is degenerated, so you call it mental.

00:38:44.602 --> 00:38:48.769
So because of this the confusion is there, because of the balance.

00:38:48.935 --> 00:38:51.268
It's surprising, that in a mental hospital

00:38:51.518 --> 00:38:55.185
you don't need anything to find out about heart,

00:38:55.393 --> 00:38:57.393
electrocardiogram and all that is not needed,

00:38:57.602 --> 00:39:01.143
because a mental case never gets a heart attack normally.

00:39:01.435 --> 00:39:04.477
So because of this confusion people call a mental case

00:39:04.685 --> 00:39:08.602
to a person who actually uses his emotional side.

00:39:08.810 --> 00:39:15.185
So for all our purposes we use a pure word called superego and ego.

00:39:15.435 --> 00:39:18.685
Now apart from that we have got the Spirit

00:39:18.894 --> 00:39:22.143
and the Spirit is in the heart.

00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:26.018
It is the reflection of God Almighty.

00:39:26.602 --> 00:39:29.810
Another thing we have got down below, is the Kundalini.

00:39:30.060 --> 00:39:33.602
Kundalini is the reflection of the Holy Ghost.

00:39:33.852 --> 00:39:38.560
And Holy Ghost is the All Pervading Power of God's Love.

00:39:38.810 --> 00:39:41.518
So that's how we have these four things separated.

00:39:41.769 --> 00:39:44.352
Another thing we have got, which is the attention,

00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:46.852
which is sustained by our liver.

00:39:47.101 --> 00:39:51.769
So now you understand we have a heart, we have an ego and superego,

00:39:51.976 --> 00:39:55.268
and we have got that power which is sleeping,

00:39:55.560 --> 00:40:00.101
which is to be awakened within us, which is called as Kundalini.

00:40:00.352 --> 00:40:01.852
In the Bible also it is said that,

00:40:02.018 --> 00:40:05.477
"I will appear before you like tongues of flames".

00:40:05.685 --> 00:40:09.310
And what you see is, are these centres, when they are enlightened,

00:40:09.518 --> 00:40:11.644
they look like tongues of flames of different colours,

00:40:11.852 --> 00:40:13.268
as shown you the picture.

00:40:13.477 --> 00:40:18.935
But ultimately the thousand petaled lotus here

00:40:19.143 --> 00:40:23.727
has many colours, all the seven colours of the rainbow.

00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:26.560
I hope it is clear to the subject.

00:40:27.101 --> 00:40:33.769
So far our Spirit has not come into our attention.

00:40:34.518 --> 00:40:35.727
Yes, speak.

00:40:43.935 --> 00:40:47.477
Is there any danger in Kundalini path being awakened too quickly?

00:40:47.685 --> 00:40:50.101
I'm sorry I should have tackled this question everybody ask,

00:40:50.310 --> 00:40:53.268
it is true. Because so many books have been written about Kundalini,

00:40:53.477 --> 00:40:57.976
which are horrifying things and there is no danger at all.

00:40:58.185 --> 00:41:00.976
Kundalini is your own Mother.

00:41:01.352 --> 00:41:04.352
She bears all the things, She bears all the problems for you.

00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:05.769
She is your own Mother.

00:41:05.935 --> 00:41:09.393
She's just waiting for the moment to give you realisation,

00:41:09.602 --> 00:41:12.477
so there is somebody who knows the job!

00:41:12.685 --> 00:41:15.518
But those people who have written about Kundalini -

00:41:15.727 --> 00:41:19.560
I've seen one book which was written, I was amazed how these people,

00:41:19.852 --> 00:41:22.435
could write about Kundalini, all this nonsense

00:41:22.644 --> 00:41:25.060
in such a big book and selling it,

00:41:25.268 --> 00:41:28.852
which has no relevance at all to the state of Kundalini,

00:41:29.018 --> 00:41:32.268
to the nature of Kundalini, even to the seat of Kundalini.

00:41:32.477 --> 00:41:37.143
They are so confused, but the realm of God,

00:41:37.727 --> 00:41:40.435
everybody tries to handle, is the sad part,

00:41:40.644 --> 00:41:42.934
that everyone tries to handle that realm

00:41:43.101 --> 00:41:44.852
and they can say whatever they like.

00:41:45.018 --> 00:41:46.685
There is no danger at all,

00:41:46.894 --> 00:41:50.560
we have given realisation to thousands and thousands of people.

00:41:50.769 --> 00:41:52.935
Of course, when the Kundalini is rising,

00:41:53.143 --> 00:41:55.018
if you have any opposition within yourself

00:41:55.226 --> 00:41:57.185
due to a disease or trouble

00:41:57.393 --> 00:42:00.477
maybe little bit, you might feel hot in the hand.

00:42:00.685 --> 00:42:03.310
But nothing more than that, or less than that.

00:42:03.518 --> 00:42:06.934
It is a very beautiful experience, very pleasant

00:42:07.101 --> 00:42:10.685
and great pleasure to Me.

00:42:11.518 --> 00:42:12.310
Yes.

00:42:13.268 --> 00:42:19.018
Is this Kundalini energy active at birth?

00:42:19.310 --> 00:42:21.810
Is it there at birth?

00:42:22.435 --> 00:42:25.101
Is the Kundalini energy present at birth?

00:42:25.310 --> 00:42:31.268
Yes! About two months or so, when you are in a foetus,

00:42:31.477 --> 00:42:35.060
it enters into your being, which is present there throughout.

00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:43.518
Is it present before birth?

00:42:43.894 --> 00:42:46.644
No, not before birth, how can it be present?

00:42:46.934 --> 00:42:49.644
You see, in the sense that in the womb it is present.

00:42:49.935 --> 00:42:53.185
It is in the womb of the mother, as the foetus it does, but

00:42:53.393 --> 00:42:55.352
before the foetus is formed, how can it be present,

00:42:55.560 --> 00:42:57.976
there has to be something to be present in.

00:42:58.185 --> 00:43:01.435
So it is there when the foetus is about two months of age,

00:43:01.644 --> 00:43:08.060
it starts expressing itself there, it is there. All right?

00:43:09.810 --> 00:43:13.226
Should we do any practice for tomorrow?

00:43:13.435 --> 00:43:14.018
For?

00:43:14.226 --> 00:43:16.268
Should we practice anything?

00:43:16.477 --> 00:43:17.935
Should we practice anything...?

00:43:18.268 --> 00:43:20.644
For tomorrow at this level.

00:43:20.852 --> 00:43:21.477
I see.

00:43:21.685 --> 00:43:23.685
Should they practice anything for tomorrow?

00:43:23.894 --> 00:43:26.185
Could I make an announcement about the workshop?

00:43:26.393 --> 00:43:27.894
All right.

00:43:28.185 --> 00:43:32.185
We haven't told you but tomorrow during the day we've got a workshop

00:43:32.393 --> 00:43:33.934
for those who would like can come along.

00:43:34.101 --> 00:43:35.976
May be a little inconvenient but

00:43:36.185 --> 00:43:39.268
for those who would like to come along, there's a place for your coming.

00:43:39.477 --> 00:43:41.060
Today we'll work it out also.

00:43:41.268 --> 00:43:42.560
You can come along but

00:43:42.769 --> 00:43:44.435
we'll make an announcement at the end of the program,

00:43:44.644 --> 00:43:46.477
and the answer is yes.

00:43:46.727 --> 00:43:49.602
But Mataji will show you at the end of the lecture

00:43:49.810 --> 00:43:53.185
after you have the experience.

00:43:53.810 --> 00:43:57.602
He seems to be a great seeker.

00:43:59.685 --> 00:44:02.685
Is there any other question please?

00:44:18.685 --> 00:44:24.852
Is this spontaneous awakening, as opposed to the more dangerous

00:44:25.393 --> 00:44:29.852
awakening that occurs some,  by some people,

00:44:30.018 --> 00:44:32.935
due to Your Power?

00:44:35.435 --> 00:44:38.477
It's very embarrassing.

00:44:39.101 --> 00:44:41.852
It is not due to Us at all, that's all I can say,

00:44:42.018 --> 00:44:43.727
but you have got your own power.

00:44:43.934 --> 00:44:46.435
Now say for example if there is a light,

00:44:46.685 --> 00:44:49.018
a candle that is enlightened, all right,

00:44:49.226 --> 00:44:51.934
and if it has to enlighten another light -

00:44:52.101 --> 00:44:56.602
is it the power of this candle that you will say that has enlightened?

00:44:57.018 --> 00:45:01.018
Because the candle itself is ready, this candle is enlightened,

00:45:01.226 --> 00:45:02.976
it just touches the other candle

00:45:03.185 --> 00:45:05.560
and that candle gets enlightened by itself,

00:45:05.769 --> 00:45:08.518
because it is just ready.

00:45:09.602 --> 00:45:12.310
I understand, from the nature I think that

00:45:12.518 --> 00:45:16.976
You have so many of the yoga teachings.

00:45:17.935 --> 00:45:19.185
What's it?

00:45:19.685 --> 00:45:22.185
Periods of starving and endeavour

00:45:22.393 --> 00:45:25.685
hopefully with Kundalini (...)

00:45:25.894 --> 00:45:29.727
and sometimes, it's told, it will be in the next life.

00:45:30.060 --> 00:45:34.934
He said, from the reading and traditionally it's said that

00:45:35.143 --> 00:45:39.352
Kundalini rises slowly and it has to be the result of certain things

00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:43.518
and I think he's a little puzzled, how it can be now

00:45:43.810 --> 00:45:45.727
in Your presence.

00:45:45.934 --> 00:45:48.268
Have you read Shankaracharya, Adi Shankaracharya?

00:45:48.477 --> 00:45:50.435
He's the master of this, all right?

00:45:50.685 --> 00:45:55.352
What he says that, "Mother can do it",  that's it.

00:45:55.685 --> 00:45:58.060
You have to find out about Myself.

00:45:58.268 --> 00:46:00.101
All right? I'll better not tell you.

00:46:00.352 --> 00:46:02.435
To be tactful, one should not talk about oneself.

00:46:02.644 --> 00:46:04.018
It's a dangerous thing.

00:46:04.310 --> 00:46:06.143
Christ has said, "I'm the life, I'm the path",

00:46:06.352 --> 00:46:08.101
and people crucified Him.

00:46:08.393 --> 00:46:11.393
Just see! You dare not say anything about yourself.

00:46:11.602 --> 00:46:14.060
If you say, they will just trouble you.

00:46:14.352 --> 00:46:15.435
It's better to keep quiet.

00:46:15.644 --> 00:46:18.976
I'll do what I have to do, then you find out about Me. All right?

00:46:19.185 --> 00:46:23.060
I don't want to say anything, because if I say anything, you feel hurt.

00:46:23.477 --> 00:46:28.101
But please, please don't misunderstand me, I'm not questioning You.

00:46:28.477 --> 00:46:29.185
I cannot...

00:46:29.393 --> 00:46:31.435
I'm trying to find out the balance,

00:46:31.644 --> 00:46:33.976
thinking that spontaneous comes to me.

00:46:34.185 --> 00:46:37.185
I personally am endeavoured to the Kriya Yoga.

00:46:37.518 --> 00:46:38.143
Yoga?

00:46:38.352 --> 00:46:39.018
Kriya Yoga.

00:46:39.226 --> 00:46:45.185
All right. All right. I understand you.

00:46:45.934 --> 00:46:51.518
Now, I'll tell you about. Kriya Yoga is against spontaneous.

00:46:51.769 --> 00:46:53.727
(...)  completely.

00:46:53.934 --> 00:46:56.769
And by Kriya Yoga you cannot get  realisation.

00:46:56.935 --> 00:46:58.435
There is no Kriya Yoga.

00:46:58.644 --> 00:47:01.226
In no traditional book it is there, no traditional.

00:47:01.435 --> 00:47:03.644
This is a new thing started by people,

00:47:03.852 --> 00:47:06.393
they used to even cut the tongues of people,

00:47:06.602 --> 00:47:09.393
say that you put it back here, put the tracheae,

00:47:09.602 --> 00:47:12.143
do all kinds of things. There are many people in India who have

00:47:12.352 --> 00:47:17.727
their tongues waving like dogs, who have been to Kriya.

00:47:17.934 --> 00:47:20.268
There's no such things needed at all.

00:47:20.477 --> 00:47:22.143
It is spontaneous, it is within you,

00:47:22.352 --> 00:47:25.602
you don't have to do anything about it. That is what it is!

00:47:25.852 --> 00:47:27.018
Absolutely!

00:47:27.226 --> 00:47:29.602
You don't have to do anything, you don't have to stand on your head,

00:47:29.810 --> 00:47:32.185
or nothing at all. It's just simple.

00:47:32.393 --> 00:47:34.976
So Kriya Yoga is not sahaja.

00:47:35.185 --> 00:47:36.644
'Is not sahaja' means

00:47:36.852 --> 00:47:40.226
'saha' means 'with' and 'ja' is 'born'. It's spontaneous.

00:47:40.435 --> 00:47:43.518
It is a spontaneous thing, you don't have to do anything about it.

00:47:43.727 --> 00:47:46.143
Nothing.

00:47:47.018 --> 00:47:51.810
But once you get it, once you get it, you can give it to others.

00:47:51.976 --> 00:47:54.560
It's like if you know how to swim

00:47:54.769 --> 00:47:58.226
and if there's somebody who does not know and he is getting drowned.

00:47:58.435 --> 00:47:59.769
What you tell that person, that

00:47:59.935 --> 00:48:02.518
"You keep quiet just now, I'll take you to the shore".

00:48:02.727 --> 00:48:04.101
Then you are brought to the shore

00:48:04.310 --> 00:48:07.894
and you teach him how to swim, and then he can save others also.

00:48:08.060 --> 00:48:09.935
But the one who does not know how to swim,

00:48:10.143 --> 00:48:14.852
has to do nothing for the time being, just to get his realisation,

00:48:15.018 --> 00:48:18.018
mature in it and then give realisation to others.

00:48:18.226 --> 00:48:21.310
No Kriya is needed at all in Sahaja Yoga.

00:48:21.518 --> 00:48:23.226
Actually it is not at all traditional.

00:48:23.435 --> 00:48:25.644
It is a very recent stuff that has come out.

00:48:25.852 --> 00:48:28.810
If you read from the past, if you read Adi Shankaracharya,

00:48:28.976 --> 00:48:31.644
the sixth century, if you read other people, Markandeya like,

00:48:31.852 --> 00:48:34.477
fourteenth century, you'll be amazed, that

00:48:34.685 --> 00:48:38.143
they have said the same thing what I am saying; this is traditional.

00:48:38.352 --> 00:48:42.226
But these new gurus came up, they started talking about this and that,

00:48:42.435 --> 00:48:43.894
but it is not so.

00:48:44.101 --> 00:48:46.934
Nobody can achieve realisation by Kriya Yoga.

00:48:47.143 --> 00:48:50.185
I've not met one. On the contrary they come to Me as patients.

00:48:50.477 --> 00:48:53.352
I must say, I'm sorry to say, but it is so.

00:48:53.560 --> 00:48:55.185
People have spent so much money,

00:48:55.393 --> 00:48:59.310
from India they have gone all the way to America to do Kriya Yoga

00:48:59.560 --> 00:49:02.435
and they are just suffering. Nobody has achieved anything.

00:49:02.644 --> 00:49:04.769
So now whatever you have done, it's finished.

00:49:04.935 --> 00:49:07.685
Now you be interested in yourself and in your seeking.

00:49:07.934 --> 00:49:09.976
Just forget it whatever you have done.

00:49:10.185 --> 00:49:11.560
Now what you have to do is,

00:49:11.769 --> 00:49:14.560
to just get your realisation and work it out.

00:49:14.769 --> 00:49:17.310
Forget it whatever you have been doing,

00:49:17.518 --> 00:49:19.560
because you have not yet achieved the result.

00:49:19.769 --> 00:49:20.644
So forget it!

00:49:20.852 --> 00:49:24.644
And see for yourself without any Kriya you receive it or not.

00:49:24.852 --> 00:49:26.810
It is all described but the trouble is,

00:49:26.976 --> 00:49:30.976
all the Sanskrit books which are authentic are not being translated.

00:49:31.185 --> 00:49:33.560
So it's not traditional at all.

00:49:33.769 --> 00:49:37.393
Christ never said you have to do anything like that.

00:49:37.644 --> 00:49:41.060
Nobody has said it. Everybody has talked of spontaneous happening.

00:49:41.310 --> 00:49:45.560
Even Martin Luther, when he tried to change people from Catholicism,

00:49:45.769 --> 00:49:47.477
he talked of spontaneity.

00:49:47.769 --> 00:49:50.268
He was also a realised soul, but later on his followers

00:49:50.477 --> 00:49:52.268
tried to make a mess of everything.

00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:55.018
In the same way Christ also talked of the same thing.

00:49:55.226 --> 00:49:57.518
Did they say that you have to stand on your head, cut your tongues,

00:49:57.727 --> 00:49:59.352
put them back, push it back?

00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:02.143
All these things are absolutely not to be done.

00:50:02.352 --> 00:50:05.602
It's very harmful, one should never do it.

00:50:14.143 --> 00:50:16.685
So let us have now the experiment, all right?

00:50:16.934 --> 00:50:18.268
All of you are seekers.

00:50:18.477 --> 00:50:21.852
Now forget what you have been doing, what is done, forget it.

00:50:22.018 --> 00:50:23.435
Because you have been -

00:50:23.644 --> 00:50:26.769
you have to be kind to yourself, to be truthful to yourself,

00:50:27.060 --> 00:50:28.185
you have to be your Self.

00:50:28.435 --> 00:50:31.769
I'm the only person who'll say that you have to get to it.

00:50:31.935 --> 00:50:34.435
If you don't get it, I will not rest and you should not rest.

00:50:34.644 --> 00:50:37.477
If I have patience for you, you should also have patience for you.

00:50:37.769 --> 00:50:40.644
Don't be angry with anyone, don't be angry with yourself,

00:50:40.894 --> 00:50:42.060
don't be angry with your gurus,

00:50:42.268 --> 00:50:44.685
whatever has happened has happened, doesn't matter.

00:50:44.894 --> 00:50:49.810
You'll be amazed, I Myself get surprised the way Divine is working.

00:50:50.018 --> 00:50:53.894
Whatever you may do it, whatever may be the problems, it works,

00:50:54.060 --> 00:50:55.644
it works, really it works.

00:50:55.852 --> 00:50:57.602
It's something so amazing.

00:50:57.810 --> 00:50:59.852
It is better that you see to it, that you get it.

00:51:00.018 --> 00:51:01.852
Because you are seekers of ages.

00:51:02.018 --> 00:51:05.560
This is not a life you are wasting, you have been seeking for ages.

00:51:05.769 --> 00:51:09.602
And today the time has come, that's why you are here to get it.

00:51:09.852 --> 00:51:12.727
So please just get your realisation. Forget the past.

00:51:12.935 --> 00:51:17.518
May God bless you all.

00:51:33.143 --> 00:51:35.560
I would request you for a simple thing:

00:51:35.769 --> 00:51:36.852
we have to take out our shoes,

00:51:37.018 --> 00:51:39.310
because the Mother Earth also takes away our problems.

00:51:39.518 --> 00:51:41.518
She's very helpful. Even the light is helpful.

00:51:41.727 --> 00:51:44.226
Now some people ask, "Why the light?" Even this little light

00:51:44.435 --> 00:51:47.852
is so helpful, if it is there. Just take out your shoes.

00:51:48.101 --> 00:51:52.852
Just to take help from the Mother Earth. It's very simple.

00:51:53.185 --> 00:51:56.935
Now you have to put your both the hands towards Me like this

00:51:57.185 --> 00:51:58.310
in a very simple way.

00:51:58.560 --> 00:52:00.101
First of all you should be comfortably seated.

00:52:00.310 --> 00:52:01.934
There should be no discomfort,

00:52:02.101 --> 00:52:04.685
so that when it is happening you again get distracted.

00:52:04.894 --> 00:52:08.185
Just to sit comfortably, have easy sitting,

00:52:08.393 --> 00:52:16.310
no, no tightening in the neck or in the -

00:52:17.226 --> 00:52:18.894
I mean uncomfortable tightening.

00:52:19.060 --> 00:52:21.769
It's all right, if you can feel comfortable.
