00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:21.199
So now we will be going for our further movement
and I may have to return back to Bombay.

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:40.870
I do not know how comfortable you were here,
but you wanted to be away from the maddening

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:50.690
crowd and I thought this would be the nice
place to be here though Dhumal was all the

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:56.040
time insisting that they should stay in some
Mangalkaryalay or something.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:02.210
But I told him, “You don’t understand
them, they don’t enjoy much of all this

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:03.210
cement, concrete.”

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:18.610
They would always like to be in the company
of nature as long as they get some protection

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:25.920
from the sun and the rain and they want to
enjoy that kind of a collective living and

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:26.920
they’ll be very happy.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.780
But still I don’t think he was very much
convinced about it, very hesitant.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:38.540
Then again he came to Bombay, I again told
him, “Now believe Me, you have to have it

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:39.540
somewhere.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.750
You just have a pendal for them, they’ll
be very happy, you just don’t worry about

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:45.750
other things.

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.390
They want to be with the nature because they
don’t get a chance like that.

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:54.370
They cannot take bath in a lake anywhere,
it’s a great chance for them to take a bath.”

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:59.190
They said the water is not so clean and maybe
that it is full of clay.

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:05.190
I said, “Clay is good for them, they’ll
like it, there’s …” And I see your skin,

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:11.880
it’s so much better, I see your skin, you
see all this you have suffered the sun burnt,

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:18.260
whatever you overdid in Ganapatipule, is now
being cleared out by this clay because the

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.270
clay is the one that soothes you.

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:25.730
Even if you can put some clay on your stomach,
it will take out all the heat from your stomach,

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.640
very good for liver this clay is.

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:34.600
So, I told them that you don’t understand
that this natural naturopathy that they can

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.630
have here, they cannot have it.

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:42.770
But he very, very reluctantly agreed thinking
that I’m really trying to be hard on you.

00:02:42.770 --> 00:03:04.060
So, this is a mild sun here and it’s nice
and the atmosphere is very clear and clean,

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:09.430
plus you have got such a beautiful temple
of Ekadesha Rudra here which is such a nice

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.350
place we have found out.

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:17.640
So for a saint, you see, for a saintly person,
what does he need?

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.690
Because he’s so satisfied with everything.

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.640
Whatever he gets he’s satisfied.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:29.800
But he will be more satisfied, he would be
much more enjoying when he’s with the nature.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.410
I know that.

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:37.270
And, they are not still very happy the Rahuri
people that they think that this is no way

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:40.910
of putting up guests like this and all that,
still.

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:47.360
I just had to tell him that you see their
faces, how they look, they look so very happy,

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.380
so very relaxed, now what do you want?

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.690
What do you want more?

00:03:53.690 --> 00:04:00.150
But now we must understand that one habit
that we have always, we have developed it

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:01.660
because we have been going out.

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:06.190
Our attention has been going out.

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.680
You see the one habit that we have in the
West, which I have noticed also, very common,

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:16.729
is, to be a daredevil for everything and to
go to the extreme.

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:18.709
You see there’s no …

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:24.319
[Shri Mataji asks a yogi] How do you say to
the bridle?

00:04:24.319 --> 00:04:30.169
Bridle you say, the one that is used for the
horse?

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:31.370
Bridle.

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:32.839
The bridle is not there.

00:04:32.839 --> 00:04:35.639
There’s no bridle, in our behavior.

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:38.449
We go to extremes in everything.

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:41.139
Whatever we do, we go to extremes.

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:48.009
There’s no bridle in our hands and this
is what, one has to get to the bridle.

00:04:48.009 --> 00:05:01.680
It is not that, it’s like a kite which is
just moving here and there, it’s not that.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:09.879
It’s a complete thrust, complete movement
with all will power, with all effort, to go

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:14.029
to something that is dangerous.

00:05:14.029 --> 00:05:22.069
I personally think it’s a self-destructive
character which is built within us as a result

00:05:22.069 --> 00:05:24.900
of our movement too much outward.

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:31.669
Because whatever moves in one direction has
to recoil back, it has a reaction.

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:34.889
Like the science has developed atomic bomb.

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:42.650
Ultimately you do develop a destructive temperament
and that is why I think in the west people

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:49.009
have no idea how to control the speed backwards.

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:54.610
It’s more the speed outward to dangerous
places they like it.

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:56.419
Nature is good.

00:05:56.419 --> 00:05:59.110
In the nature it’s nice to be there.

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:05.949
But it does not mean that you should ask the
nature to hit you and kill you.

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:10.729
Now in Ganapatipule I was so sad to see those
boys who burnt themselves.

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:16.900
It was really very, very saddening to Me and
when I treated them, of course they got well

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:19.990
but you wont’ believe the whole of My stomach
here, [SHRI MATAJI PUTS HER HAND ON HER STOMACH]

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:30.849
the whole skin of My stomach was burnt, charred
and burnt and is now peeling out, just like

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:35.849
they had the problem, I never went to the
sea, I never stayed there.

00:06:35.849 --> 00:06:40.330
So, this was the heat they were carrying.

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:48.990
Now people get, say, what you call, skin troubles,
skin cancers.

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:51.180
Still they want to do it.

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:59.059
Like the other lady who was so sick from Switzerland
is so sick, you see, I was really very worried

00:06:59.059 --> 00:07:06.399
because she was very dangerously placed and
she is the one who had this problem and she

00:07:06.399 --> 00:07:09.680
said, “I have an addiction with the sun.”

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:12.199
How can you be addicted to the sun?

00:07:12.199 --> 00:07:15.400
Is just a mental idea.

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:23.169
And believe Me, it’s just a mental idea
that if you go in the sun your skin will be

00:07:23.169 --> 00:07:24.169
all right.

00:07:24.169 --> 00:07:25.949
It’s just a mental idea.

00:07:25.949 --> 00:07:32.360
Have you seen anyone like that?

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:38.110
I mean what is the proof that if you go in
the sun your skin will improve, what is the

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:39.110
proof?

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:46.300
We Indians never, never go in the sun.

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:47.300
Never.

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:55.520
We never go in a windy place, never in a windy
place, we never go, say for example this skiing.

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:58.459
According to us skiing is a stupid job.

00:07:58.459 --> 00:08:00.349
We would never do it.

00:08:00.349 --> 00:08:06.629
Any Indian who does that is a stupid fellow
according to us.

00:08:06.629 --> 00:08:12.719
Women will never do horse riding because it
affects the uterus.

00:08:12.719 --> 00:08:18.069
The women don’t swim after sometime because
it affects the uterus and if it affects the

00:08:18.069 --> 00:08:28.469
uterus, it affects the whole system because
uterus represents your Kundalini.

00:08:28.469 --> 00:08:30.400
All wrong ideas you have got.

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:34.130
That’s why I see that in the West everybody
is sick.

00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:38.780
They have this trouble or that trouble or
this or that.

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:44.850
Certain principles are to be borne in our
mind because we are saints and we are precious

00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:45.850
things.

00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:50.600
We are not like other Westerners, that we
can waster our life like this for some sort

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:53.910
of a stupid venture that we think of .

00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:57.220
Can you imagine all Indians have much better
skin than you have.

00:08:57.220 --> 00:08:58.900
All right.

00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:00.590
Don’t they?

00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:05.440
Do they ever go in the sun?

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:09.140
Never.

00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:12.990
Have you seen any Indian sitting outside here
taking sunbath?

00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:20.060
I mean the proof of the pudding is that despite
all that your skins are so bad.

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:26.520
Now how can your skin be good with the sun,
let us see.

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:31.780
Let us say, Let us take absolutely a chemical
reaction.

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:39.630
Now what happens that when the, the thing
falls upon our skin or upon our head, this

00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:43.670
head has got a brain and the brain is made
of fat.

00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:44.670
All right?

00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:49.770
Now if you put the fat in the sun, what will
happen?

00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:51.300
It will melt.

00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:54.850
And that’s how people have melted brains.

00:09:54.850 --> 00:10:02.390
The brains are not normal, they behave in
a way which I don’t understand why they

00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:04.460
behave like this.

00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:12.130
So first of all if your brain goes out, how
can your skin be all right?

00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:14.940
Because the brain controls the skin.

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:15.940
It controls everything.

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:27.610
If your brain goes off, I’ve not met one
person who looks beautiful because he has

00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:32.860
been in the sun.

00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:38.160
On the contrary, you stay at home.

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:39.410
Preserve your skin by staying at home.

00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:50.200
The second point is that a Sahaja Yogi should
not behave like other Westerners do that at

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:53.070
every holiday, they’re out.

00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:56.730
They never sit in the house.

00:10:56.730 --> 00:10:57.730
Gruhastha.

00:10:57.730 --> 00:11:00.070
The one who stays in the house.

00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:02.630
We are all Gruhasthas, householders, we are
married people.

00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:04.870
As soon as you get a holiday you’re out.

00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:11.170
Now you might give an explanation, “Because
you see our houses are like this and, we think

00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:15.320
that our houses are just suffocating us.”

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:19.010
Have you seen the houses of the poor people
here?

00:11:19.010 --> 00:11:22.020
Have you seen the houses of the labor in Bombay?

00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:25.550
Nobody goes out for a holiday.

00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:32.180
All My life I don’t think I’ve been ever
out for a holiday with My husband.

00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:36.420
Only once we tried for two days and we were
back from Scotland all the way.

00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:43.570
We just go for a wedding or a festival or
something like that.

00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:47.660
If there’s some collective happening or
else you can go for a picnic, all of you together.

00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:54.800
But you must sit down in the house and talk
to each other nicely, there should be some

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:55.800
rapport.

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:59.190
There’s no rapport between the children
and the parents, there’s no rapport between

00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:08.750
the husband and the wife, no rapport between
the in-laws, other people, no rapport at all.

00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:16.400
So you become people who are absolutely secluded,
shooting off this way, that way, that way.

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:20.200
Sit down and talk.

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:25.150
Now you see our children, now we talk that
our children should be disciplined.

00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:30.180
The best way to discipline your child is to
make the child sit down for a while and talk

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:32.610
to the child properly.

00:12:32.610 --> 00:12:39.240
Tell the child what he’s supposed to do.

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:42.260
You’ll find an Indian child goes to somebody’s
house just keeps quite.

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.470
But let an English child come.

00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:51.690
He will break this, he’ll break that, give
me chocolates, give me this, I want this.

00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:57.810
You take an Indian child, maybe a poor child
to a market, he’ll never ask for anything,

00:12:57.810 --> 00:12:58.810
demand for anything.

00:12:58.810 --> 00:12:59.810
Never.

00:12:59.810 --> 00:13:01.760
Even if you give, he’ll say, “No, I won’t
have.”

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:03.680
He has that self-respect.

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:09.730
But if you take a child, any other child,
he’ll say, “Please buy me this, please

00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:11.090
buy me that, please buy me that.”

00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:16.930
Without any self-respect, without any discipline.

00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:19.890
Now where does the discipline come up?

00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:25.110
Now what we do, supposing a child is there,
we are going out, we tell the child, “Now

00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:32.980
we are going out, and you have to be a self-respecting
child because,” supposing now you are talking

00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:37.190
you can say, “You are a realized soul, you
are a Sahaja Yogi and you can’t behave like

00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:43.280
a stupid fellow asking for this and that,”
and sit down quietly, make them sit down.

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:47.060
To begin with, you have to do lot of massaging
on their body.

00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:54.890
Lots of massaging, everyday massage, massage,
massage the body so the nerves are all right.

00:13:54.890 --> 00:14:03.650
Then, when you take them out or do anything,
before hand, tell them properly, build up

00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:08.550
their personality of self-respect, of discipline.

00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:12.860
But you yourself should be disciplined, now
you are sitting in the sun, say, for the whole

00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:17.010
day and you tell your son, “Get inside the
house,” how will he?

00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:20.430
A Sahaja Yogi should never go in the sun.

00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:21.910
Take it from Me.

00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:24.660
Never, never go in the sun.

00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:32.760
Because this brain requires complete quietitude
and no sun activity is needed.

00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:37.060
You should not even, when you sleep, there
should not be even a ray of sun.

00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:42.320
Even I, when I sleep I want complete darkness.

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:48.051
Even a slightest ray of light is coming, which
people know very well, I cannot sleep, because

00:14:48.051 --> 00:14:50.960
I must act.

00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:57.950
So the reaction to this light is so much in
Me, maybe that I’m very sensitive to all

00:14:57.950 --> 00:15:02.260
the elements but what about you?

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:09.300
You must avoid the sun’s light as much as
you can when you sleep and also should not

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:11.820
sit in the sun for such a long time.

00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:17.880
Of course sitting in the sun helps you because
it gives you Vitamin D, by which, Vitamin

00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:22.960
D if you take it you build up your bones better
but now I think your bones are quite built,

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:25.800
there’s no need to build your bones anymore.

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:32.589
But now by God’s grace you are getting soluble
calciums which you can eat and you can also

00:15:32.589 --> 00:15:36.070
have Vitamin D and A if you want to.

00:15:36.070 --> 00:15:39.360
What is the need of scorching this head?

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:47.290
Now, if you sit in the sun, then either you
will have a bald head or you will have a jungle

00:15:47.290 --> 00:15:48.290
in the head.

00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:51.580
One of the two thing’s depending on the
personality as you are.

00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:59.450
Because your brain cannot bear it, your skin
cannot bear it.

00:15:59.450 --> 00:16:04.810
After all we are not jungle people are we?

00:16:04.810 --> 00:16:10.350
But you ask any jungle person also, he never
sits in the sun.

00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:19.680
It’s only somebody has cooked it in your
head that you must sit in the sun.

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:32.500
If you go and see Eskimos who live in the
ice houses, they never bathe in the sun.

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:35.860
Have you ever seen them sunbathing?

00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:42.070
Have you ever seen them?

00:16:42.070 --> 00:16:45.800
Any picture, anywhere?

00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:52.730
Then why this special type of stupidity is
there among other people because you have

00:16:52.730 --> 00:17:00.890
lost that sense to know that you are maneuvered.

00:17:00.890 --> 00:17:05.230
You see, how to befool you.

00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:10.839
Now you must create some weaknesses for people,
if you don’t create a weakness how will

00:17:10.839 --> 00:17:13.730
they prosper with their machineries?

00:17:13.730 --> 00:17:16.629
So now, let’s befool them.

00:17:16.629 --> 00:17:24.149
If you go to the seashore and you tan your
body, you look very beautiful?

00:17:24.149 --> 00:17:30.110
First of all, you never, you look horrid,
horrid you look and secondly they will say

00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:38.269
that your health will be all right so everybody
is going to the seashore, ending up with a

00:17:38.269 --> 00:17:40.159
skin cancer.

00:17:40.159 --> 00:17:45.520
Because your body revolts against it that’s
why you get skin cancer.

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:47.529
You get liver troubles, already you are liverish.

00:17:47.529 --> 00:17:54.080
You are already thinking too much, why do
you want to have sun?

00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:58.760
You’ve already too much sun within yourself.

00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:03.440
So what is the reasoning for it?

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:05.399
I just don’t understand.

00:18:05.399 --> 00:18:11.679
You must know that today we have the work
of the Sahasrara and the Sahasrara is the

00:18:11.679 --> 00:18:13.450
brain.

00:18:13.450 --> 00:18:20.399
We have to work on the brain and if you people
do not know how to use your brain properly,

00:18:20.399 --> 00:18:23.860
I don’t know what am I going to do.

00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:29.690
Moreover today, talking to some Indians, I
discovered some horrifying things which I

00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:38.029
must tell you, which is horrifying as well
as laughed at They were telling Me that if

00:18:38.029 --> 00:18:44.119
you take an English hen and an Indian hen,
there’s a tremendous big difference between

00:18:44.119 --> 00:18:45.340
the two.

00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:53.119
The hen that is Indian, if she sees another
hen being attacked she’ll make such a noise

00:18:53.119 --> 00:18:59.920
that all the hen will join together and will
start making noises so that if there’s an

00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:03.330
attack the master will come and try to remove
the attack.

00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:09.950
But if it’s an English hen, she will just
watch another being eaten up you see and then

00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:12.879
she’s eaten up also, she says, “All right
you eat me, doesn’t matter, I’ll take

00:19:12.879 --> 00:19:14.400
second birth and come back.”

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:19.169
See they’ve no brains at all.

00:19:19.169 --> 00:19:25.909
You see they have no brains, like say an English
bullock, they have English bullocks also.

00:19:25.909 --> 00:19:29.620
I mean English means Western, they don’t
mean anything else but he’s Australian,

00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:34.889
maybe anything, is English to us because we
had known only English so we say English.

00:19:34.889 --> 00:19:39.909
But that’s what they say English but it
doesn’t mean anything, it means any Westerner

00:19:39.909 --> 00:19:42.379
or any Australian or white skin person.

00:19:42.379 --> 00:19:46.200
A bullock is there, he said, “Our bullocks
if you tell them.

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:50.289
‘go straight,’ they know; if you tell
them, ‘go left,’ they know; if you tell

00:19:50.289 --> 00:19:53.289
them, ‘walk this way,’ they know;they
know everything.

00:19:53.289 --> 00:19:56.389
But if you have any of these bullocks, they
don’t do anything.

00:19:56.389 --> 00:20:03.350
You tell them go further, you teach them anything,
nothing, they will never learn any thing.

00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:06.610
You tell them, they’ll go the way they want
to go.”

00:20:06.610 --> 00:20:08.710
So very surprising, I said, “Really?”

00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:14.499
“Yes” they said, “It is so, they are
for no good, they can just do what they want

00:20:14.499 --> 00:20:16.009
to do.

00:20:16.009 --> 00:20:19.820
They cannot understand what you’re talking,
they have no understanding about it.”

00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:21.220
Imagine about the bulls.

00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:26.360
And then think of it, in India, you see we
have everything walking on the street, we

00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:31.110
have got the bullocks and we have got the
cows, we’ve got sometimes the hen, everything

00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:32.190
goes on the road.

00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:36.720
They know which side the thing is coming,
which side they have to move, there’s a

00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:37.720
car coming.

00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:43.350
He said, “Put one English cow, they’ll
be all finished on the road.”

00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:48.505
I got such a fright you know when I heard
it.

00:20:48.505 --> 00:20:54.409
I said, “They do not do sunbathing.

00:20:54.409 --> 00:20:59.029
How do they get it?” then I was thinking
that the kind of the food you give them, there

00:20:59.029 --> 00:21:04.750
must be some horrible hormones, they must
be spoiling their brains.

00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:08.970
But we are very destructive, I must tell you.

00:21:08.970 --> 00:21:14.740
Drugs, now we started taking to drugs, in
the name of God.

00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:19.710
I mean Indians, you make them take drugs,
they’ll say tell another, I know what it

00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:20.710
is.

00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:23.429
And then our brains go off with drugs.

00:21:23.429 --> 00:21:29.110
Brains are not normal, why we behave like
this I can only explain that they have taken

00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:33.690
drugs, I’ve seen people who have taken drugs
I just don’t understand why, there’s no

00:21:33.690 --> 00:21:34.690
logic into their behavior.

00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:41.659
Just no logic, they just, like the brains
of a bullock, they behave the same way.

00:21:41.659 --> 00:21:42.760
You just can’t explain why they behave.

00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:44.100
They have taken drugs.

00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:46.000
Now what is drug taking?

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.159
Is again self-destructive.

00:21:47.159 --> 00:21:50.820
Because you want to destroy yourself that’s
why you’ve taken drugs.

00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:54.559
Otherwise how many Indians you have known
who take drugs?

00:21:54.559 --> 00:22:05.440
I’ve never even seen them.

00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:14.679
And another thing, Dhumal told Me, I mean
he says his reading is he says that if a child

00:22:14.679 --> 00:22:19.059
is educated in a vernacular school, I was
also educated in a vernacular school because

00:22:19.059 --> 00:22:22.980
My father was very particular, “Nothing
doing, no English schools.”

00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:27.759
And those who are educated in the English
schools, there’s such a difference, he say’s

00:22:27.759 --> 00:22:32.220
he has his children educated in the English
school and he has his children educated in

00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:33.390
a vernacular school.

00:22:33.390 --> 00:22:35.289
The youngest one is in the vernacular school.

00:22:35.289 --> 00:22:37.529
He says he knows about everything.

00:22:37.529 --> 00:22:45.539
He’ll know how many cows are in the house,
he will look after parrots, he knows how the

00:22:45.539 --> 00:22:48.860
parrot works out, how the things are, he’s
the youngest.

00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:53.789
He knows about everything but other children
they just will stand.

00:22:53.789 --> 00:22:59.850
If you tell them, they’ll give an explanation
and then they say, “So what?

00:22:59.850 --> 00:23:00.850
So what?”

00:23:00.850 --> 00:23:06.059
But if you tell him something, immediately
he will know what is to be done, he’ll just

00:23:06.059 --> 00:23:12.869
get it done the way he wants to do it, in
the sense that it must be done.

00:23:12.869 --> 00:23:14.400
But here the other way round.

00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:19.580
If you tell a child from an English school,
he will do the way he wants to do and if you

00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:24.549
tell him, “Why did you do this way?” he’ll
say, “What’s wrong?” or at the most

00:23:24.549 --> 00:23:25.790
he’ll say, “I’m sorry.”

00:23:25.790 --> 00:23:26.790
Finished.

00:23:26.790 --> 00:23:29.690
I mean like Sahaja Yogis will pull their ears,
finished.

00:23:29.690 --> 00:23:34.330
Even if he hit’s you, he’ll say, “Pull
my ear’s Mother, I’ve hit You.”

00:23:34.330 --> 00:23:35.440
It’s like that.

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:39.190
It’s very funny thing, I said what’s wrong
with the language?

00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:43.409
Why this English language makes people like
that?

00:23:43.409 --> 00:23:44.409
I can’t understand.

00:23:44.409 --> 00:23:45.409
Why?

00:23:45.409 --> 00:23:47.759
I just didn’t understand.

00:23:47.759 --> 00:23:50.169
“What’s wrong?”

00:23:50.169 --> 00:23:55.289
Now this is not in any Indian language, you
see if you say, they’ll say, “What?

00:23:55.289 --> 00:23:59.179
We didn’t understand, what are you saying,
‘What’s wrong?’”

00:23:59.179 --> 00:24:06.419
I mean just, the whole, I think the language
itself has the disciplining in-built, it’s

00:24:06.419 --> 00:24:15.580
a what you call Mardav, it builds up the personality.

00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:19.679
Like if somebody tries to show off.

00:24:19.679 --> 00:24:22.409
You see, immediately we’ll say, “You are
over wise.”

00:24:22.409 --> 00:24:23.649
Ati Shahane.

00:24:23.649 --> 00:24:26.200
And the saying is, “Ati Shahane tyanche
baila rikame.”

00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:34.179
Those who try to show that they are very intelligent,
their bullocks have no work, means they’re

00:24:34.179 --> 00:24:35.409
lazy lumps.

00:24:35.409 --> 00:24:39.109
The whole language system is such.

00:24:39.109 --> 00:24:44.659
They’re so practical I tell you, they’re
so practical.

00:24:44.659 --> 00:24:50.720
And that is why, we came to India first of
all, we had some Sahaja Yogis with us when

00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:58.080
we came here about twenty-five Sahaja Yogis
from England came and we all stayed here and

00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:02.980
all these people looked after them and they
fed them and of course I mean, they had paid

00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:05.409
no money, nothing they lived there.

00:25:05.409 --> 00:25:10.909
Nobody even wrote a letter of thanks so they
all got worried and they wrote a letter to

00:25:10.909 --> 00:25:15.380
Me saying that Mother what has happened, are
they all right or are they sick?

00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:17.669
They have not written any letter to us.

00:25:17.669 --> 00:25:21.549
So I called them, I said, “Did you write
any letters to them?”

00:25:21.549 --> 00:25:22.549
“No”.

00:25:22.549 --> 00:25:23.549
I said, “Why?”

00:25:23.549 --> 00:25:25.750
“We know, we know, we did wrong, we know.”

00:25:25.750 --> 00:25:28.429
“You know, then why did you not do it?”

00:25:28.429 --> 00:25:32.309
“No but we know.”

00:25:32.309 --> 00:25:37.929
Now what is an argument here?

00:25:37.929 --> 00:25:42.909
Now you have come out of that, what I’m
giving you, the background.

00:25:42.909 --> 00:25:51.330
You have come out of it, now you are Sahaja
Yogis, you are saints, so you have to be very

00:25:51.330 --> 00:25:52.330
different.

00:25:52.330 --> 00:26:00.029
You can’t be like them.

00:26:00.029 --> 00:26:02.679
You have to understand.

00:26:02.679 --> 00:26:08.980
Like some people have a habit of saying, “Ah,
Mother I’m so badly off.”

00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:09.980
You ask them, “How are you?”

00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:13.369
They’ll say [SHRI MATAJI SWAYS HER HAND
INDICATING ‘SO-SO’] like this, it’s

00:26:13.369 --> 00:26:17.730
very common, so I look at their hands, what’s
it?

00:26:17.730 --> 00:26:18.990
I don’t understand.

00:26:18.990 --> 00:26:20.880
What does that [SHRI MATAJI SWAYS HER HAND
INDICATING ‘SO-SO’] mean?

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:23.720
Here people will feel ashamed to say.

00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:27.590
Even if you are sick, even if you are dying.

00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:28.590
If somebody will ask, “How are you?”

00:26:28.590 --> 00:26:29.590
They will say, “I’m all right.

00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:30.590
I’m all right.”

00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:41.269
Nobody will do like this [SHRI MATAJI SWAYS
HER HAND INDICATING ‘SO-SO’] Means what?

00:26:41.269 --> 00:26:43.809
You ask them “What’s your name?”

00:26:43.809 --> 00:26:45.190
“Did you ask my name?”

00:26:45.190 --> 00:26:49.210
“Of course I did, but why do you ask Me
again?”

00:26:49.210 --> 00:26:54.450
Any question you ask, they will repeat it,
always.

00:26:54.450 --> 00:26:56.230
I used to wonder why do they repeat?

00:26:56.230 --> 00:26:59.379
And they didn’t get it in their heads or
what?

00:26:59.379 --> 00:27:04.369
Now the thing is, that is what is the background
of this brain and don’t spoil it more by

00:27:04.369 --> 00:27:06.799
this sun.

00:27:06.799 --> 00:27:16.769
You have to do work of this Sahasrara, Sahasrara
which is the lotus, lotus of the Divine which

00:27:16.769 --> 00:27:21.940
has got beautiful petals now enlightened by
your Kundalini.

00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:27.190
They are the living petals, do not try to
play with it.

00:27:27.190 --> 00:27:32.720
That’s why I say, don’t read funny books,
don’t see funny things, don’t talk to

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:38.950
funny people, don’t waste your energy in
worrying, in futuristic attitude, keep to

00:27:38.950 --> 00:27:39.950
yourself.

00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:46.940
Let this [SHRI MATAJI PUTS HER HAND ON HER
HEAD] grow because the roots are in the brain.

00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:55.440
The tree of awareness grows downward but the
roots are in the brain and you have to go

00:27:55.440 --> 00:28:01.700
to the roots now because you have done that
movement now you come back and for that you

00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:04.720
have to know to look after your brain.

00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:14.640
The other day I also said that I don’t know
why you people don’t put any oil whatsoever.

00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:20.549
Why not put oil in the head, poor head needs
the oil always, at least on a Saturday, put

00:28:20.549 --> 00:28:24.929
so much oil, rub it nicely and have a bath.

00:28:24.929 --> 00:28:27.639
But people just don’t put any oil in their
head.

00:28:27.639 --> 00:28:32.889
I mean you must oil, gear up your brain, don’t
you think so?

00:28:32.889 --> 00:28:39.860
If you don’t put oil in any machine, it
will crack.

00:28:39.860 --> 00:28:46.409
For this brain which is your special machine
after Sahaja Yoga is really a very special

00:28:46.409 --> 00:28:54.210
one, you must try to put lot of oil in it.

00:28:54.210 --> 00:28:59.789
Put some oil in the ears, put some oil in
the nose.

00:28:59.789 --> 00:29:06.059
Now the modern theory of the doctors is don’t
put any oil or anything into the ears and

00:29:06.059 --> 00:29:09.119
the noses of the children.

00:29:09.119 --> 00:29:15.749
Rajesh’s brother had a child and they went
to of course to a latest Doctor from America.

00:29:15.749 --> 00:29:23.950
And the child was crying, weeping, feeling
so horrible and his Brahmarandra, what you

00:29:23.950 --> 00:29:28.220
call, the fontanel bone area was not filled
at all, it was all open.

00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:30.460
I said, “What’s the matter with you people?”

00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:33.169
They said the doctor has said, “Don’t
touch the oil.”

00:29:33.169 --> 00:29:34.169
I said, “What?”

00:29:34.169 --> 00:29:37.080
They said, “He’ll have allergy”.

00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:40.850
I said, “Nothing of the kind, you bring
the oil.”

00:29:40.850 --> 00:29:45.999
I got one full katori [KATORI MEANS BOWL IN
HINDI] of oil, rubbed it on his head, pushed

00:29:45.999 --> 00:29:50.679
back that thing and I put it in nose, in ears,
the child slept like a log of wood.

00:29:50.679 --> 00:29:55.049
Imagine how much the child must have suffered?

00:29:55.049 --> 00:29:57.309
These stupid ideas come from where?

00:29:57.309 --> 00:30:02.830
I don’t know, they don’t have any oil
these days, so what is their idea is to do,

00:30:02.830 --> 00:30:05.899
some business must be behind it, I don’t
know what is going on.

00:30:05.899 --> 00:30:09.950
I don’t know what they are going to run
by not giving any oil to the children.

00:30:09.950 --> 00:30:14.730
They must be having some business with that
also.

00:30:14.730 --> 00:30:17.210
Otherwise it is absolutely a stupid idea.

00:30:17.210 --> 00:30:20.429
I just don’t understand that the child has
an allergy.

00:30:20.429 --> 00:30:26.220
But how presumptuous to think like that!

00:30:26.220 --> 00:30:30.049
Now why the child has an allergy.

00:30:30.049 --> 00:30:32.210
Now let Me ask a question.

00:30:32.210 --> 00:30:40.509
Why a child will have an allergy?

00:30:40.509 --> 00:30:49.239
The doctors have to answer.

00:30:49.239 --> 00:30:59.220
Or, of course you are all doctors so you should
say.

00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:00.220
Can I have the answer?

00:31:00.220 --> 00:31:01.220
Yogi: It could be an imbalance of heat and
cold in the body?

00:31:01.220 --> 00:31:02.220
Shri Mataji: But why?

00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:03.220
Say on the chakras.

00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:18.690
You say on the chakras what will be catching.

00:31:18.690 --> 00:31:21.769
If somebody has allergies, what does it catch?

00:31:21.769 --> 00:31:23.690
Yogi: The Left Nabhi.

00:31:23.690 --> 00:31:25.139
Shri Mataji: Correct.

00:31:25.139 --> 00:31:26.139
Left Nabhi.

00:31:26.139 --> 00:31:28.700
Left Nabhi will catch.

00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:33.899
Now that means the mother.

00:31:33.899 --> 00:31:37.570
Because the child is not yet married so it’s
the mother.

00:31:37.570 --> 00:31:45.090
That means mother must be having a left Nabhi
herself and that’s why the child must catching

00:31:45.090 --> 00:31:51.979
with that allergy, so instead of punishing
the child, why not cure the left Nabhi of

00:31:51.979 --> 00:31:56.499
the mother and left Nabhi of the child?

00:31:56.499 --> 00:32:00.509
Now what will you do if there’s a left Nabhi
of the child?

00:32:00.509 --> 00:32:26.059
What we can do to help the child to get rid
of it?

00:32:26.059 --> 00:32:31.809
Ah, very simple.

00:32:31.809 --> 00:32:36.580
Anything that is left can be taken out on
the little flame.

00:32:36.580 --> 00:32:43.190
Put your right hand on the left Nabhi of the
child and put your left hand to the flame

00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:47.340
and finished.

00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:53.830
Now in diagnosis you are easy but now for
medicines, now remember the certain principles

00:32:53.830 --> 00:32:55.970
of medicines.

00:32:55.970 --> 00:32:58.960
Very certain principles are there.

00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:06.879
If it is left side, you have take it to the
fire or to the sun or to the flames, all right?

00:33:06.879 --> 00:33:11.429
If it is a left side [could Shri Mataji have
meant “right”?] you have take it to the

00:33:11.429 --> 00:33:12.429
water in general.

00:33:12.429 --> 00:33:22.220
Any body suffering from right side, put him
in the water, finished.

00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:23.280
Done.

00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:25.340
Not in the sun of course.

00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:36.389
Any disease, you bring it to this point.

00:33:36.389 --> 00:33:40.539
It’s very simple.

00:33:40.539 --> 00:33:42.210
Now let Me have some questions about certain
diseases.

00:33:42.210 --> 00:33:45.460
Yogi: They’ve been asking Me for the last
three weeks.

00:33:45.460 --> 00:33:48.409
Shri Mataji: Huh?

00:33:48.409 --> 00:34:01.500
Yogi: They’ve been asking Me for the last
three weeks, so they must have it.

00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:05.640
Shri Mataji: All right let’s have it, I
will see if I can answer.

00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:06.640
Yes.

00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:08.880
Yogi: Psoriasis, Mother?

00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:11.300
Shri Mataji: Huh?

00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:12.920
Yogi: Psoriasis.

00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:16.160
Shri Mataji: Same thing.

00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:19.800
Psoriasis is nothing else but left side problem.

00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:22.320
Is a lethargic liver.

00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:26.430
And gives you allergies.

00:34:26.430 --> 00:34:35.250
For psoriasis, left hand towards the photograph
and right hand on the Mother Earth.

00:34:35.250 --> 00:34:42.300
Putting hot water bottle on the stomach.

00:34:42.300 --> 00:35:01.020
Or even giving bandhan to your liver with
the light is all right.

00:35:01.020 --> 00:35:05.230
You must see, because psoriasis, now people
might think psoriasis means active liver or

00:35:05.230 --> 00:35:08.800
inactive liver, you see it comes to that point.

00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:11.530
But we have only two types: active or inactive.

00:35:11.530 --> 00:35:15.440
Now whether psoriasis is inactive or active
you will know from one point that when the

00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:22.970
liver is inactive you get the allergies, and
when it is active you get other problems like

00:35:22.970 --> 00:35:35.160
what you call that in English, I don’t know,
nausea and also you get biliousness.

00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:40.980
You don’t eat much, you thin down all these
problems are there.

00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:42.120
Now what else?

00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:43.820
Yogi: Eczema?

00:35:43.820 --> 00:35:48.920
Shri Mataji: For eczema same thing.

00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:58.020
Eczema is the same thing, is just like allergy,
eczema same thing.

00:35:58.020 --> 00:36:02.420
But for eczema because it’s outward you
can use certain things like neem ka pata and

00:36:02.420 --> 00:36:05.830
all that I’ve told you and so many things
can be used on top.

00:36:05.830 --> 00:36:08.420
Yogi: Fungus?

00:36:08.420 --> 00:36:16.180
Shri Mataji: Fungus, outside or inside?

00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:18.870
Yogi: On the skin.

00:36:18.870 --> 00:36:21.130
Shri Mataji: Is one of the worst thing is
fungus.

00:36:21.130 --> 00:36:26.710
Same thing, but it’s the worst thing I should
say that it’s the left side again is the

00:36:26.710 --> 00:36:31.830
attack is the left side fungus is all dead
and you have to use the left side towards

00:36:31.830 --> 00:36:35.490
the photograph and right hand on the places
wherever you have the fungus, you may take

00:36:35.490 --> 00:36:41.850
it out that way but don’t eat cheese, and
the fungousy cheese you are not supposed to

00:36:41.850 --> 00:36:43.160
eat at all.

00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:46.860
All the Sahaja Yogis should not eat any fungousy
cheese.

00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:56.880
That blue one, with a crust one, all fungus
must to avoided, and also mushrooms if possible.

00:36:56.880 --> 00:37:06.280
Yogi: Why does cow’s milk make allergies
and eczema worse?

00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:10.050
Shri Mataji: What is…?

00:37:10.050 --> 00:37:19.450
Yogi: Why does cow’s milk make allergies
and eczema worse?

00:37:19.450 --> 00:37:23.220
Shri Mataji: Cow’s milk..

00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:26.410
Yogi: Because it’s left side?

00:37:26.410 --> 00:37:27.920
Shri Mataji: Left side.

00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:33.050
Cow’s milk always give you the left side
because she’s the mother, and you should

00:37:33.050 --> 00:37:38.040
not have her milk, because it’s left sided.

00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:43.101
Whether it is cow’s milk or buffalo’s
milk, all will give allergies but if you have

00:37:43.101 --> 00:37:51.630
animals which are smaller than you like if
you can drink like Mahatma Gandhi the goat’s

00:37:51.630 --> 00:38:10.710
milk then you might not have the problem.

00:38:10.710 --> 00:38:11.760
Yogi: We do completely around..

00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:13.230
When we have diarrhea we drink milk.

00:38:13.230 --> 00:38:14.500
Shri Mataji: Diarrhea you drink milk?

00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:19.250
The amount of salads you eat, sometimes I
think this fodder will make us like buffalos

00:38:19.250 --> 00:38:21.250
or what?

00:38:21.250 --> 00:38:29.230
I just can’t touch them I tell you.

00:38:29.230 --> 00:38:40.210
But I have to eat just to show that I appreciate.

00:38:40.210 --> 00:38:41.610
Yogi: Bronchial Asthma.

00:38:41.610 --> 00:38:45.330
Shri Mataji: Bronchial asthma is caused by
the combination of the right heart and the

00:38:45.330 --> 00:38:46.490
left heart.

00:38:46.490 --> 00:38:56.380
If the parents have been quarreling too much,
if they are divorced, if you never had the

00:38:56.380 --> 00:39:02.690
security of the parent’s love, then you
get bronchial asthma, but if it is another

00:39:02.690 --> 00:39:09.910
one just superficial one then it could be
from the father’s death or from the fatherhood

00:39:09.910 --> 00:39:16.090
suffering but if father and motherhood both
have made you insecure or if both of them

00:39:16.090 --> 00:39:21.470
have died then you get bronchial asthma.

00:39:21.470 --> 00:39:23.370
Is a combination.

00:39:23.370 --> 00:39:25.220
Yogi: Hypoglycemia.

00:39:25.220 --> 00:39:28.930
Shri Mataji: What’s that?

00:39:28.930 --> 00:39:32.640
Yogi: Low blood level.

00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:33.640
Hypo-glycemia.

00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:37.270
Shri Mataji: I know.

00:39:37.270 --> 00:39:40.060
Low blood level.

00:39:40.060 --> 00:39:44.060
That comes from over activity.

00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:47.570
You should not think so much.

00:39:47.570 --> 00:39:48.570
Agnya.

00:39:48.570 --> 00:39:51.000
Too much of Agyna.

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:52.370
Agnya chakra.

00:39:52.370 --> 00:39:55.110
Too much of agnya.

00:39:55.110 --> 00:40:03.830
Surrender yourself to Christ, absolutely surrender
yourself to Christ, it will work out.

00:40:03.830 --> 00:40:05.370
Yogi: Spondylitis.

00:40:05.370 --> 00:40:09.960
Shri Mataji: Spondylitis is left Vishuddhi.

00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:14.560
And right Vishuddhi could be also.

00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:17.770
But mostly left Vishuddhi Spondylitis.

00:40:17.770 --> 00:40:20.040
Combination also could be.

00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:23.580
Yogi: Multiple Sclerosis.

00:40:23.580 --> 00:40:33.000
Shri Mataji: Multiple Sclerosis is comes from
Mooladhara.

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:36.530
Mooladhara and Nabhi.

00:40:36.530 --> 00:40:41.240
Left Nabhi and Mooladhara.

00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:44.960
It’s more left sided.

00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:47.910
Give the treatment of the left side.

00:40:47.910 --> 00:40:51.990
Saying the name of Ganesha and of Gauri.

00:40:51.990 --> 00:40:54.850
It will work out.

00:40:54.850 --> 00:40:57.710
Yogi: Varicose veins Mother.

00:40:57.710 --> 00:40:59.850
Shri Mataji: Huh?

00:40:59.850 --> 00:41:01.990
Yogi: Varicose veins.

00:41:01.990 --> 00:41:09.610
Shri Mataji: It comes from the people who
stand too much all the time and they work

00:41:09.610 --> 00:41:10.780
very hard.

00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:17.900
As soon as it starts it’s better to cure
them, you have to lie down everyday.

00:41:17.900 --> 00:41:24.590
Those who stand everyday for more than say
three-four hours should lie down on bed and

00:41:24.590 --> 00:41:25.590
do cycling.

00:41:25.590 --> 00:41:28.800
[SHRI MATAJI MAKES CYCLING MOVEMENTS WITH
HER HANDS].

00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:32.580
Everyday, that will help reduce the weight
maybe due to weight also.

00:41:32.580 --> 00:41:42.010
Some people have weight, but those who stand,
I’ve seen those who stand for a long time

00:41:42.010 --> 00:41:48.230
without the heels, if you use the heels you
might be better off.

00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:54.900
With the heels the pressure is not so much
then it is distributed more to the lower of

00:41:54.900 --> 00:41:58.480
those five chakras down below that might help.

00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:04.530
But, best is to do exercise after you have
stood for a long time just lie down in the

00:42:04.530 --> 00:42:11.630
bed and do cycling, and also massaging, slowly
massaging it downward.

00:42:11.630 --> 00:42:21.980
Also it can work out with the ice treatment,
you can put some ice before massaging you

00:42:21.980 --> 00:42:33.950
can put the ice on them and use very cold
oil and rub it, it will work out.

00:42:33.950 --> 00:42:35.060
Yogi: Flu?

00:42:35.060 --> 00:42:36.060
Flu?

00:42:36.060 --> 00:42:39.530
Shri Mataji: That’s one thing is difficult.

00:42:39.530 --> 00:42:40.740
Flu.

00:42:40.740 --> 00:42:47.980
Now for flu, first of all this is again left-sided.

00:42:47.980 --> 00:42:53.800
But we have got a very good medicine in India
I don’t know if you have that there is what

00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:58.330
you call is the basil [IN HINDI IT IS CALLED
TULSI].

00:42:58.330 --> 00:43:03.580
Basil leaves, you take lots of basil leaves
make a concoction, it’s called?

00:43:03.580 --> 00:43:04.580
Yogi: Infusion.

00:43:04.580 --> 00:43:05.700
Shri Mataji: Huh?

00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:06.700
Yogi: Infusion.

00:43:06.700 --> 00:43:07.830
Shri Mataji: No.

00:43:07.830 --> 00:43:10.800
Yogi: Boil it up in a pot.

00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:16.480
Shri Mataji: Boil it up in a pot, make it
absolutely, the essence take it out quite

00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:21.450
thick put tea in it or wateror just like the
way you want to make it like a tea and put

00:43:21.450 --> 00:43:28.400
milk or whichever way you want but less milk
and sugar because the taste may not be so

00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:29.400
good.

00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:34.410
And then you drink it, before that you have
to prepare some what you call for dhuni?

00:43:34.410 --> 00:43:39.100
You all know ajwain ka dhuni.

00:43:39.100 --> 00:43:43.080
You see you know that.

00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:53.270
So you take ajwain ka dhuni after that, that’s
all.

00:43:53.270 --> 00:44:04.470
You do it three days you’ll be all right,
cleared out.

00:44:04.470 --> 00:44:09.560
Yogi: Shri Mataji, psychosomatic diseases…?

00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:12.620
Shri Mataji: What?

00:44:12.620 --> 00:44:24.840
Yogi: He’s saying psychosomatic diseases
in particular, nervous break down comes from

00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:25.860
where?

00:44:25.860 --> 00:44:27.730
Right side or left side?

00:44:27.730 --> 00:44:30.840
Shri Mataji: You see it’s a very funny word
psychosomatic means it’s also psycho and

00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:34.330
it’s also somatic, so I don’t know which
one it is, if you say psycho somatic or somatic

00:44:34.330 --> 00:44:35.330
psycho.

00:44:35.330 --> 00:44:36.330
Yogi: You mean psychological diseases?

00:44:36.330 --> 00:44:37.330
Shri Mataji: Nehi, nehi.

00:44:37.330 --> 00:44:38.330
Psychosomatic is nervousness you see.

00:44:38.330 --> 00:44:41.620
Nervousness can be caused by bad habits.

00:44:41.620 --> 00:44:43.880
How?

00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:49.870
Like if you are an air hostess you form a
bad habit, as soon as you see the airport

00:44:49.870 --> 00:44:53.210
[SHRI MATAJI MOVES HER HAND AROUND HER STOMACH
INDICATING NERVOUSNESS].

00:44:53.210 --> 00:44:55.210
Now those who travel too much.

00:44:55.210 --> 00:44:59.040
As soon as they have to travel they go off
their heads.

00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:05.051
Over doing anything, you see, you get nervous
feeling, it’s a matter of habit, you form

00:45:05.051 --> 00:45:07.310
that habit so it happens.

00:45:07.310 --> 00:45:13.580
So, I will not say it is due to some bhadha
or anything, but your nerves are too much

00:45:13.580 --> 00:45:15.450
used in a particular way.

00:45:15.450 --> 00:45:18.830
Then they just give in, they cannot work it
out anymore.

00:45:18.830 --> 00:45:21.630
So then you must change that habit.

00:45:21.630 --> 00:45:29.210
Supposing you are traveling too much by plane,
then travel by a ship, or travel by a train,

00:45:29.210 --> 00:45:33.200
or by a bullock cart.

00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:41.710
Or don’t travel, something like that, anything
that you over do too much that forms a kind

00:45:41.710 --> 00:45:43.790
of a strain on your nerves.

00:45:43.790 --> 00:45:48.760
So try to reduce that strain on your nerves.

00:45:48.760 --> 00:45:55.570
Yogi: You recommended heels, what height?

00:45:55.570 --> 00:46:06.580
Shri Mataji: No, no I didn’t say for all
of you.

00:46:06.580 --> 00:46:09.160
I said for varicose veins.

00:46:09.160 --> 00:46:11.360
Or specially for people who develop problems
on the heels.

00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:19.030
There’s no height you just try whatever
you can say about one inch will do from one

00:46:19.030 --> 00:46:26.770
inch onward, anything, not too much one inch
or lower, but you see if you develop some

00:46:26.770 --> 00:46:35.650
sort of a bone on your heels or something
like that for that the heels are always better.

00:46:35.650 --> 00:46:39.240
Little heels are better.

00:46:39.240 --> 00:46:40.240
Baldness.

00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:43.720
It’s not a disease.

00:46:43.720 --> 00:46:50.000
But it comes out of many habits.

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:52.770
One of them is wearing the hat.

00:46:52.770 --> 00:46:59.910
If you wear the hat too tight then the circulation
of the brain is spoiled and that’s when

00:46:59.910 --> 00:47:01.560
you might get one.

00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:09.400
Then also with the left Nabhi you might develop
a back bald head here if you have a left Nabhi

00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:14.870
then their’s no circulation, it works out
that way.

00:47:14.870 --> 00:47:25.310
And they say that if somebody has a bald head
he will get some money, he’s a moneyed man,

00:47:25.310 --> 00:47:26.310
in India.

00:47:26.310 --> 00:47:36.140
I don’t know why we believe in such a thing,
but we believe that if you have a bald head

00:47:36.140 --> 00:47:40.880
means he’s a moneyed man, you see, the one
who does not have a bald head is not a moneyed

00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:47.820
man, who doesn’t have a belly is not a dignified
man, according to Indian standards.

00:47:47.820 --> 00:47:51.410
But bald head is caused by not using oil.

00:47:51.410 --> 00:47:55.650
Or, by not using proper oil.

00:47:55.650 --> 00:48:05.290
Oil should be used properly and the skull
must be actually the skull must be rubbed

00:48:05.290 --> 00:48:12.710
not the skin so that if you rub it the skin
must move on the skull and then you won’t

00:48:12.710 --> 00:48:13.860
have this problem.

00:48:13.860 --> 00:48:20.710
Another is that if you use funny type of oils
with lots of fragrance and essences in it

00:48:20.710 --> 00:48:22.740
then you might get grey hair.

00:48:22.740 --> 00:48:30.380
And also ghee should never be used for rubbing
in the head but you can use it for the body

00:48:30.380 --> 00:48:39.761
is good ghee or even the butter is good if
you are overactive, then, otherwise not, but

00:48:39.761 --> 00:48:46.610
ghee should never be used or butter should
never be used for the hair.

00:48:46.610 --> 00:48:50.090
Now you have two types of bald heads, as I
told you.

00:48:50.090 --> 00:48:52.690
Some who start from here and some who start
from there.

00:48:52.690 --> 00:48:54.180
[SHRI MATAJI POINTS TO THE FRONT OF HER HEAD
AND THEN TO THE BACK].

00:48:54.180 --> 00:48:56.740
It’s a very interesting subject.

00:48:56.740 --> 00:48:58.270
[YOGIS LAUGH TOO].

00:48:58.270 --> 00:49:02.040
And, those who have both, could be.

00:49:02.040 --> 00:49:09.990
Now I would say the one which starts from
here [SHRI MATAJI POINTS TO THE FRONT OF THE

00:49:09.990 --> 00:49:17.770
HEAD] are the people who are the ones who
have got an Ekadesha problem also possibly.

00:49:17.770 --> 00:49:23.310
With the Ekadesha problem it starts or who
are not very collective or something, it will

00:49:23.310 --> 00:49:24.530
start receding back.

00:49:24.530 --> 00:49:32.030
All right, those who start from here [SHRI
MATAJI POINTS TO THE BACK OF THE HEAD] are

00:49:32.030 --> 00:49:38.930
the people who may not be good husbands, maybe
something wrong with their wives, maybe bad

00:49:38.930 --> 00:49:45.280
wives, the husband-wife relationship is upsetting
then also this starts at the back or maybe

00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:51.890
there’s some incompatibility between the
two or too much attachment to the wife or

00:49:51.890 --> 00:49:56.370
too much attachment to the husband also you
start developing like that.

00:49:56.370 --> 00:50:01.620
All these things are left Nabhi, so the left
Nabhi relationship you know is the Gruha Lakshmi

00:50:01.620 --> 00:50:07.480
relationship, where you adore your wife so
much that she’s no more a Gruha Lakshmi

00:50:07.480 --> 00:50:11.810
also is a wrong thing, these things start
with that.

00:50:11.810 --> 00:50:17.680
And also could be, also could be with your
hectic life, if you are very hectic in your

00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:22.860
life running up and down doing too much work
also it may start, you don’t listen to your

00:50:22.860 --> 00:50:27.450
wife about it and you think you have to do
this work then also it might start it there

00:50:27.450 --> 00:50:31.200
are so many reasons for the left Nabhi to
start, but the one that starts here [SHRI

00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:34.060
MATAJI POINTS TO HER FOREHEAD AREA] starts
with the right Nabhi or we can say with the

00:50:34.060 --> 00:50:36.560
Ekadesha more on this side.

00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:41.150
So I don’t know in your case, Johan, what
should I blame.

00:50:41.150 --> 00:50:49.000
I would say is a complete neglect, complete
neglect of your hair, no oiling at all that’s

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:55.650
what it is, I mean if you do not give water
to the plant it will die and then if you say

00:50:55.650 --> 00:50:58.920
why is it caused, I mean if you don’t give
it water it’s the one that it eats, drinks

00:50:58.920 --> 00:51:01.770
and lives on so oil is the one on which the
hair reside.

00:51:01.770 --> 00:51:10.810
Yogi: In the west we get pain in the knees
when we sit on the ground, is there anyway

00:51:10.810 --> 00:51:21.470
of avoiding it?

00:51:21.470 --> 00:51:30.060
Shri Mataji: You see it is due to the Nabhi
you have.

00:51:30.060 --> 00:51:35.130
Right or the left and no practice of sitting
down.

00:51:35.130 --> 00:51:42.380
Now what you have to do that you have to learn
a certain what you call an exercise.

00:51:42.380 --> 00:51:46.700
I’ve told people what is the exercise needed
for it then you’ll get used to it you’ll

00:51:46.700 --> 00:51:50.290
start sitting on the ground all right without
feeling the pain on the knees.

00:51:50.290 --> 00:51:54.620
It will help you in the long run very much.

00:51:54.620 --> 00:51:57.670
There are certain exercises to be done.

00:51:57.670 --> 00:52:03.170
But at least your children you make them sit
on the ground from now so that there’s no

00:52:03.170 --> 00:52:04.170
problem for them.

00:52:04.170 --> 00:52:11.970
Yogi: I noticed that a lot of ladies…

00:52:11.970 --> 00:52:17.960
Shri Mataji: Here?

00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:19.990
In the West?

00:52:19.990 --> 00:52:29.690
Yogi: When I came to Paris, I noticed a lot
of ladies after sixty years old began to lose

00:52:29.690 --> 00:52:30.690
hair.

00:52:30.690 --> 00:52:34.380
Shri Mataji: But sixty years one should have
that otherwise they don’t look all right,

00:52:34.380 --> 00:52:40.160
you see, in sixty years you should look like
a sixty year old, you see, otherwise it’s

00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:41.160
very embarrassing.

00:52:41.160 --> 00:52:45.870
For Me I must say I must also get some bald
head and some wrinkles and this and that.

00:52:45.870 --> 00:52:50.590
Because, you see, once we were traveling and
we had some lady with us she’s six years

00:52:50.590 --> 00:52:55.240
younger to Me and Modi was all the time trying
to help her, poor old lady, poor old lady,

00:52:55.240 --> 00:53:00.460
I said what’s this nonsense, she’s six
years, younger to Me and you are just trying

00:53:00.460 --> 00:53:02.370
to help her all the time.

00:53:02.370 --> 00:53:04.110
What about Me?

00:53:04.110 --> 00:53:10.050
Nobody’s bothered, they make Me sit for
hours together, they do this, do that.

00:53:10.050 --> 00:53:19.750
Supposing if I looked old, you would have
said, “No, no Mother, you must be tired.”

00:53:19.750 --> 00:53:24.980
Now the ladies develop that because they might
be dominating women – possibly, or maybe

00:53:24.980 --> 00:53:27.950
they are neglecting their hair.

00:53:27.950 --> 00:53:29.720
Yogi: Or drunkenness.

00:53:29.720 --> 00:53:31.500
Shri Mataji: Huh?

00:53:31.500 --> 00:53:33.280
Yogi: Or drunkenness.

00:53:33.280 --> 00:53:40.760
Shri Mataji: Drunkenness, also could be they
might have taken drugs or maybe, in the west

00:53:40.760 --> 00:53:49.970
anything is possible under the sun, you see,
or maybe, they’ve had some problems with

00:53:49.970 --> 00:53:56.140
their mothers or something like that basically
must be there but I think mostly it is due

00:53:56.140 --> 00:53:58.920
to neglect, complete neglect of the hair.

00:53:58.920 --> 00:54:07.710
You see these hair styles, now you go to any
person who is doing this hair styling within

00:54:07.710 --> 00:54:13.550
three years time we are bald, then they will
give a wig, that’s their business.

00:54:13.550 --> 00:54:16.620
So going to these hair dressers and all that
you develop it.

00:54:16.620 --> 00:54:19.930
What is the need to go to the hair dresser?

00:54:19.930 --> 00:54:21.130
I don’t understand.

00:54:21.130 --> 00:54:24.750
There’s no need, waste your time, waste
your money.

00:54:24.750 --> 00:54:26.260
You look very nice without it.

00:54:26.260 --> 00:54:30.260
Yogi: Is there a chance to get lost hair back?

00:54:30.260 --> 00:54:31.460
Shri Mataji: Huh?

00:54:31.460 --> 00:54:32.460
What she…?

00:54:32.460 --> 00:54:36.260
Yogi: Is there a chance to get lost hair back?

00:54:36.260 --> 00:54:41.050
Shri Mataji: Ah, you might.

00:54:41.050 --> 00:54:44.590
Try.

00:54:44.590 --> 00:54:53.760
If not by Sahaja Yoga, they say there is a
method.

00:54:53.760 --> 00:54:55.430
They put something here there [SHRI MATAJI
POINTS TO THE TOP OF HER HEAD] and they plant

00:54:55.430 --> 00:54:56.580
it and all those things they do.

00:54:56.580 --> 00:54:59.160
If you do it then I’ll see to it that they
grow well.

00:54:59.160 --> 00:55:02.040
Yogi: Why are diseases through generations
limited to seven generations?

00:55:02.040 --> 00:55:12.970
Or any trouble, Mother, that comes through
the generations?

00:55:12.970 --> 00:55:34.640
Shri Mataji: The problems are like this.

00:55:34.640 --> 00:55:44.040
There’s only one center which covers all
the seven centers which is the Mooladhara.

00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:47.560
Because it is the Omkara.

00:55:47.560 --> 00:55:53.230
It is the Chaitanya.

00:55:53.230 --> 00:55:59.160
If Mooladhara is insulted, say I said that
if there’s an incest relationship and the

00:55:59.160 --> 00:56:03.730
family grows then it is seven generations.

00:56:03.730 --> 00:56:10.520
But, if it is between a very holy relationship
like a mother and a son or something like

00:56:10.520 --> 00:56:18.180
that then it is fourteen generations.

00:56:18.180 --> 00:56:28.480
It’s complete insult of Shri Ganesh and
so many of these can come from there most

00:56:28.480 --> 00:56:32.080
of it comes because Shri Ganesha gives you
the real strength.

00:56:32.080 --> 00:56:33.970
Those who have insulted Shri Ganesha are always
delicate people physically, so you have to

00:56:33.970 --> 00:56:35.540
reestablish your Shri Ganesh.

00:56:35.540 --> 00:56:38.380
Yogi: …How to keep the body cool in summer?.

00:56:38.380 --> 00:56:39.380
Shri Mataji: Uh?

00:56:39.380 --> 00:56:50.570
Yogi: How to keep the body cool in summer?

00:56:50.570 --> 00:56:59.850
Shri Mataji: To keep the body cool in summer
first of all you have to do is to take some

00:56:59.850 --> 00:57:07.790
ice and rub it on your liver, keep the liver
cool, don’t think too much, don’t take

00:57:07.790 --> 00:57:14.770
hot things like in the summer time so many
people eat those watermelons and things like

00:57:14.770 --> 00:57:15.770
that.

00:57:15.770 --> 00:57:20.820
They should be cooled down properly, like
even mangos in India must be cooled down and

00:57:20.820 --> 00:57:22.050
then taken.

00:57:22.050 --> 00:57:26.780
All such fruits should be cooled down and
then eaten.

00:57:26.780 --> 00:57:30.640
Some people eat the mangos just from the tree,
that’s very wrong.

00:57:30.640 --> 00:57:34.530
You have to cool it down for twenty-four hours
and then eat it.

00:57:34.530 --> 00:57:38.420
This we knew all of us, but in modern times
I don’t know if people don’t know.

00:57:38.420 --> 00:57:40.220
All these things add up.

00:57:40.220 --> 00:57:46.540
Then reduce on meats and fish specially, you
should not eat fish in the summertime at all.

00:57:46.540 --> 00:57:52.850
First of all it is spoiled, something wrong
with it or else it has phosphorous which ignites

00:57:52.850 --> 00:57:53.850
you.

00:57:53.850 --> 00:57:57.290
So avoid all these things, eat things which
are cool.

00:57:57.290 --> 00:58:01.960
Now specially for India it is very easy because
we have got something called gool khand which

00:58:01.960 --> 00:58:07.670
is made out of rose petals which is a very
good thing for cooling the liver, then cardamom,

00:58:07.670 --> 00:58:11.260
then the candy sugar, sugar itself.

00:58:11.260 --> 00:58:17.710
All these things will cool down your liver
and you’ll feel very good.

00:58:17.710 --> 00:58:26.150
It’s the change in your diet is very important
during the summertime.

00:58:26.150 --> 00:58:36.800
Yogi: Hemorrhoids, is it a Mooladhara problem?

00:58:36.800 --> 00:58:38.320
Hemorrhoids?

00:58:38.320 --> 00:58:44.410
Shri Mataji: Right side.

00:58:44.410 --> 00:58:48.970
Right side Mooladhara.

00:58:48.970 --> 00:58:52.020
Right side.

00:58:52.020 --> 00:58:57.830
For that you have to keep yourself cool, again
get the cooling effects, all the cooling things

00:58:57.830 --> 00:59:03.570
to be done and also a very good thing is to
eat the black dried grapes.

00:59:03.570 --> 00:59:07.580
What do you call them?

00:59:07.580 --> 00:59:09.190
Yogi: Raisins.

00:59:09.190 --> 00:59:11.600
Shri Mataji: Raisins.

00:59:11.600 --> 00:59:16.900
Black raisins, soak them in the night with
some orange juice and eat them, I mean soak

00:59:16.900 --> 00:59:23.380
them in the morning eat them in the night
before sleeping.

00:59:23.380 --> 00:59:40.490
That

00:59:40.490 --> 00:59:58.250
will cool down, that’s very, very cooling
[HINDI] I’ve forgotten the name.

00:59:58.250 --> 01:00:13.200
[MARATHI] For allergy the best is gheru, you
take all of you, you should take gheru those

01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:21.690
who suffer from allergy and we get little
stone pieces round ones rub it on that and

01:00:21.690 --> 01:00:30.820
take it with some water about seven times
and then eat it, is good for allergies, but

01:00:30.820 --> 01:00:35.320
everybody should not only those who have allergies,
gheru is not good for people who have overactive

01:00:35.320 --> 01:00:36.320
liver.

01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:37.320
Now if you’re finished, huh..

01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:38.320
Shri Mataji: Kya?

01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:39.320
[IT MEANS “WHAT?”

01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:40.320
IN HINDI]

01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:59.280
Yogi: India has the biggest problem of leprosy
particularly Bihar and U.P., what is the reason?

01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:03.250
Shri Mataji: It’s a kind of a, you know
it’s an infectious disease and now they

01:01:03.250 --> 01:01:10.990
have found some sort of a thing for that leprosy,
is not only in India it was everywhere, but

01:01:10.990 --> 01:01:20.540
you know the [HINDI] the ones what you call
them the parasites which create this leprosy

01:01:20.540 --> 01:01:35.300
drink kerosene oil, petrol, they prosper in
petrol, do you know that?

01:01:35.300 --> 01:01:48.700
Yogi: What is the treatment in Sahaja for
that?

01:01:48.700 --> 01:01:53.650
Shri Mataji: For leprosy, you see, for any
infection as such it’s all left-sided.

01:01:53.650 --> 01:01:57.360
One can work it out but as far as possible
keep out of it.

01:01:57.360 --> 01:01:58.360
Infectious diseases you better not treat.

01:01:58.360 --> 01:02:05.200
This is very dangerous, I will never advise
you because you shouldn’t waste your energy

01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:08.210
on lepers now, leave them to Me.

01:02:08.210 --> 01:02:14.110
Which is the easiest way to cure yourself?

01:02:14.110 --> 01:02:21.690
Yogi: What about people who are born with
epilepsy?

01:02:21.690 --> 01:02:26.980
Shri Mataji: Oh, epilepsy is curable, hundred
percent curable, it’s a left-sided problem,

01:02:26.980 --> 01:02:32.230
epilepsy whether born or anything can be cured,
can be cured.

01:02:32.230 --> 01:02:35.270
Yogi: [SAYS SOMETHING INAUDIBLE]

01:02:35.270 --> 01:02:36.270
Huh?

01:02:36.270 --> 01:02:37.270
Excessive?

01:02:37.270 --> 01:02:39.810
Yogi: Excessive tooth decay?

01:02:39.810 --> 01:02:42.850
Shri Mataji: Tooth decay?

01:02:42.850 --> 01:02:54.001
You see for tooth decay the thing is you must
use your fingers to rub on your teeth you

01:02:54.001 --> 01:02:57.630
see that’s the thing and also on your gums.

01:02:57.630 --> 01:03:01.420
So what you have because you have got vibrations,
your right Vishuddhi’s quite all right,

01:03:01.420 --> 01:03:07.150
it is due to right Vishuddhi, so what you
have to do is deficiency in Right Vishuddhi

01:03:07.150 --> 01:03:13.500
gives you, rub it nicely with olive oil and
little salt, very good finely thinned out

01:03:13.500 --> 01:03:25.180
salt and it will stop it everyday, everyday,
brushing is not sufficient.

01:03:25.180 --> 01:03:28.162
Shri Mataji: One more, one more.

01:03:28.162 --> 01:03:29.162
One more here.

01:03:29.162 --> 01:03:30.162
What’s it?

01:03:30.162 --> 01:03:31.162
Sit down, sit down.

01:03:31.162 --> 01:03:44.180
Yogi: What is the reason for having your intestines
all on the left side?

01:03:44.180 --> 01:03:47.220
Shri Mataji: All on the left side?

01:03:47.220 --> 01:03:50.880
Nothing on the right.

01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:52.710
Good idea.

01:03:52.710 --> 01:03:54.540
Left side.

01:03:54.540 --> 01:04:05.900
There’s no reason as such you see after
all think that God creates so many human beings.

01:04:05.900 --> 01:04:12.530
Even I mean you tell about two hundred people
to do some work, one goes this way, another

01:04:12.530 --> 01:04:18.620
goes that way, you don’t know what happens,
they go so helter-skelter.

01:04:18.620 --> 01:04:32.820
Now in that sometimes it’s a freak it happens,
there are freaks, it makes no difference.

01:04:32.820 --> 01:04:36.600
All right, what do you want?

01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:39.000
What’d she say?

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.400
Yogi: Ulcerative colitis.

01:04:41.400 --> 01:04:51.450
Shri Mataji: Ulcerative colitis comes by people
who have amebiosis maybe one of them could

01:04:51.450 --> 01:04:54.100
be, is it there?

01:04:54.100 --> 01:04:55.100
Hmm.

01:04:55.100 --> 01:04:57.410
Yogi: Is there amebiosis?

01:04:57.410 --> 01:05:00.059
Shri Mataji: Yeah, yes.

01:05:00.059 --> 01:05:01.059
Could be due to that.

01:05:01.059 --> 01:05:07.820
Or could be due to very hot food if you eat,
or if you drink too much and all these things

01:05:07.820 --> 01:05:13.860
you see can be affecting, but mostly it is
due to amebiosis I’ve seen it and hot food,

01:05:13.860 --> 01:05:27.440
you shouldn’t eat hot food, like some people
like very hot food and they get this trouble.

01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:43.950
Yogi: Does anyone have a question that’s
a little more visionary?

01:05:43.950 --> 01:05:46.210
A little less medical.

01:05:46.210 --> 01:05:51.490
What about Hailey’s Comet appearing later
this year?

01:05:51.490 --> 01:05:54.780
Shri Mataji: I’ve seen it.

01:05:54.780 --> 01:06:02.950
This Mr. Hailey had seen it and he said this
will happen, that will happen and they say

01:06:02.950 --> 01:06:15.210
so it’s a good sign, let’s see, you see
whatever maybe the stars, whatever may be

01:06:15.210 --> 01:06:24.290
the things, unless and until human beings
become sensitive nothing can happen.

01:06:24.290 --> 01:06:29.910
We have to be sensitive people to receive
the blessings of these things otherwise Hailey

01:06:29.910 --> 01:06:34.350
may come, Mailey may come but we go on forever
to be.

01:06:34.350 --> 01:06:41.540
If we are become sensitive then only it will
happen, first of all when there is ego what’s

01:06:41.540 --> 01:06:44.220
it’s nothing is going to work out.

01:06:44.220 --> 01:06:52.440
Ego has to go down and you have to feel everything,
the vibrations and everything of the atmosphere

01:06:52.440 --> 01:07:04.920
of all the stars, then it will work out.

01:07:04.920 --> 01:07:12.730
Otherwise, it has no effect.

01:07:12.730 --> 01:07:24.070
Yogi: What is the proper attitude when we
take darshan from You?

01:07:24.070 --> 01:07:30.910
I’ve never known how to approach You.

01:07:30.910 --> 01:07:36.780
Shri Mataji: Oh, it’s rather embarrassing.

01:07:36.780 --> 01:07:50.470
All right I’ll close My eyes and My face
and I’ll tell you [MARATHI].

01:07:50.470 --> 01:07:51.470
Now.

01:07:51.470 --> 01:07:55.360
Your question is nice.

01:07:55.360 --> 01:08:11.470
Now supposing Christ appears before you and
you know He’s Christ, what will happen?

01:08:11.470 --> 01:08:26.000
That should be the attitude at least minimum,
though Christ had to manage only one chakra

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:32.569
I have to manage seven.

01:08:32.569 --> 01:08:40.660
If that attitude develops even thinking of
Me is sufficient, you have to just think of

01:08:40.660 --> 01:08:46.870
Me your diseases will be cured.

01:08:46.870 --> 01:08:48.620
That depth has to be there.

01:08:48.620 --> 01:08:53.850
This is just one chakra seven times raised
to the power seven.

01:08:53.850 --> 01:08:57.680
That’s what it is.

01:08:57.680 --> 01:09:05.100
You have seen the miracles, you have seen
the photographs, you have seen thousands getting

01:09:05.100 --> 01:09:07.460
Realization, none of them did it.

01:09:07.460 --> 01:09:12.920
But also I’m Mahamaya.

01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:21.340
But in your heart you should know whom you
are facing.

01:09:21.340 --> 01:09:38.589
But mostly people get into the web of Mahamaya
very much that awe is so fulfilling, so penetrating,

01:09:38.589 --> 01:09:48.400
so deep that one lives with that idea only
all the time, you don’t need anything with

01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:49.400
that.

01:09:49.400 --> 01:09:56.270
It’s a very great fortune, if I were you
I would have called Myself the most fortunate

01:09:56.270 --> 01:10:04.010
person, but it’s the other way round, I
don’t know what to say then, though I must

01:10:04.010 --> 01:10:08.900
say that I’m very fortunate because compared
to all of them I have so many of you here

01:10:08.900 --> 01:10:16.750
who are Sahaja Yogis, so I’m very fortunate,
very happy about it, very happy, but still

01:10:16.750 --> 01:10:20.400
to grow in that you have to know what it is.

01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:31.370
Indians have senses, it goes easily into their
heads, they are very sensitive.

01:10:31.370 --> 01:11:17.890
In the same way I hope you develop it in that
way, in that fashion, then life would be very

01:11:17.890 --> 01:11:20.420
enjoyable.

01:11:20.420 --> 01:11:40.650
All right now coming back to something practical.

01:11:40.650 --> 01:11:52.891
I have to ask you have you made all the purchases
that are needed for your pujas in your various

01:11:52.891 --> 01:11:53.891
countries?

01:11:53.891 --> 01:12:00.080
Yogi: They are going to do some of it in Bombay,
on the day it’s available.

01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:04.410
When the busses go back in each case.

01:12:04.410 --> 01:12:12.020
Shri Mataji: Because all those who are going
Europeans, please raise your hands.

01:12:12.020 --> 01:12:13.020
By the earlier.

01:12:13.020 --> 01:12:14.020
Yogi: First bus.

01:12:14.020 --> 01:12:15.020
Shri Mataji: First bus.

01:12:15.020 --> 01:12:17.560
Yogi: Monday 7:15 the Egypt Airfly will leave
on the 17th morning.

01:12:17.560 --> 01:12:23.650
Shri Mataji: Now there’s one good solution
also, I was saying that if you start very

01:12:23.650 --> 01:12:27.650
early in the morning, next day you may reach
there for this work but the shops close very

01:12:27.650 --> 01:12:28.650
fast.

01:12:28.650 --> 01:12:34.410
Another one could be you make a list of things
that you want and send it over to Nima or

01:12:34.410 --> 01:12:43.480
someone, and they’ll keep it ready for you
so you need not go to the shop to get it.

01:12:43.480 --> 01:12:49.620
For example, if you want to buy a mukhoot,
you want to buy this and that, better give

01:12:49.620 --> 01:12:53.850
her a list and they will keep it ready for
you.

01:12:53.850 --> 01:13:02.580
As soon as you go you’ll get them, is a
better idea, don’t leave it to chances because

01:13:02.580 --> 01:13:08.880
when you travel you see you don’t know the
car may not take you at the right time, the

01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:19.260
shops maybe closed, being Sunday it’s going
to be difficult again, best is to make a list,

01:13:19.260 --> 01:13:24.160
even Saturday is very difficult there, it’s
so crowded and all that.

01:13:24.160 --> 01:13:31.140
So make a list of things that you want definitely,
and those otherwise you can try later on some

01:13:31.140 --> 01:13:38.570
that you want to buy personally but actually
these things are so common and so understandable

01:13:38.570 --> 01:13:45.520
you write it down whatever you want for your
puja.

01:13:45.520 --> 01:13:46.520
Have you got any list?

01:13:46.520 --> 01:13:48.570
Of say what one needs for the puja?

01:13:48.570 --> 01:13:51.020
No all together what you want to buy?

01:13:51.020 --> 01:13:54.560
Then make a list now, sit down and make a
list, now when you’ve made the list, I’ll

01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:56.500
send somebody to Bombay who will purchase
all these things, keep ready for you, put

01:13:56.500 --> 01:14:02.030
the price for you, you pay them and you take
them.

01:14:02.030 --> 01:14:08.430
I don’t think you’ll have much chance
to go to any shop and I would advise don’t

01:14:08.430 --> 01:14:11.040
go to any shop on a Saturday.

01:14:11.040 --> 01:14:18.770
On the contrary, you just go to the airport,
rest there and take your things.

01:14:18.770 --> 01:14:30.570
Yogi: They reach on Friday night, they have
all day Saturday and they go in the small

01:14:30.570 --> 01:14:31.570
hours of Sunday morning.

01:14:31.570 --> 01:14:34.100
Shri Mataji: Why do you want them to go on
Friday night?

01:14:34.100 --> 01:14:37.730
Better let them go on Saturday morning.

01:14:37.730 --> 01:14:40.300
Yogi: They choose that.

01:14:40.300 --> 01:14:42.870
Shri Mataji: I see.

01:14:42.870 --> 01:14:45.260
And what about you people?

01:14:45.260 --> 01:14:47.340
Yogi: We’re going the next day.

01:14:47.340 --> 01:14:51.720
We’ll leave on Saturday and the flights
not only until Tuesday or Wednesday.

01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:53.200
Shri Mataji: All right.

01:14:53.200 --> 01:14:57.800
Yogi: But if you suggest Mother that they
go on Saturday they’ll do it.

01:14:57.800 --> 01:15:00.750
No, is better go earlier because in any case.

01:15:00.750 --> 01:15:08.650
You know why I was saying that maybe you see
cars and this and that supposing it fails

01:15:08.650 --> 01:15:13.820
or something better to be there one day earlier.

01:15:13.820 --> 01:15:18.710
Try if you can get something because Saturday’s
such a crowded thing there, I don’t know.

01:15:18.710 --> 01:15:21.239
Yogi: We’ll still make this common list
for the puja.

01:15:21.239 --> 01:15:23.270
Shri Mataji: In any case you should.

01:15:23.270 --> 01:15:30.590
Whatever you have is all right, if you don’t
have you better make it here, I mean you spend

01:15:30.590 --> 01:15:36.830
so much time making the mookhut, what’s
the need?

01:15:36.830 --> 01:15:43.330
You can get it here ready made, very good
ones, any amount, any type you want, if you

01:15:43.330 --> 01:15:46.910
want to do it you can do it but normally there’s
no need.

01:15:46.910 --> 01:15:49.270
Yogi: They don’t know what mookhut is Mother?

01:15:49.270 --> 01:15:50.270
Shri Mataji: Huh?

01:15:50.270 --> 01:15:52.640
Yogi: You better tell them what mookhut is.

01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:54.710
Shri Mataji: Mookhut is the crown.

01:15:54.710 --> 01:15:55.710
Yes.

01:15:55.710 --> 01:15:59.390
All right, by all means you can see.

01:15:59.390 --> 01:16:01.470
It’s done or not.

01:16:01.470 --> 01:16:05.810
Yogi: [HINDI – Requesting Shri Mataji to
vibrate kumkum for Australia.]

01:16:05.810 --> 01:16:08.350
Shri Mataji: Ha, Ha, please bring it.

01:16:08.350 --> 01:16:10.950
[Individual conversations between Shri Mataji
and Yogi continues]

01:16:10.950 --> 01:16:14.660
Shri Mataji: For the hair, coconut oil is
the best.

01:16:14.660 --> 01:16:17.450
If before going, whatever silver you have
got you put it in your suitcase.

01:16:17.450 --> 01:16:21.070
Find it also customs you just … [voice breaks
a bit] Please tell them frankly that these

01:16:21.070 --> 01:16:25.520
are [Shri Mataji requests to increase the
volume of the microphone] … these are your

01:16:25.520 --> 01:16:30.470
wedding presents, would be better if you wrap
it with some …

01:16:30.470 --> 01:16:40.760
Shri Mataji tells a yogi specifically: It’s
not meant for you in any case, meant for married

01:16:40.760 --> 01:16:41.760
people.

01:16:41.760 --> 01:16:46.880
In case you are carrying the silver with you
then put it in your suitcases with a wrapper,

01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:50.950
with the wishing of somebody like that for
your marriage.

01:16:50.950 --> 01:16:53.810
You should say, “We got married.”

01:16:53.810 --> 01:16:57.150
Or, somebody has to say, “We re-married.

01:16:57.150 --> 01:16:58.580
It’s a present.”

01:16:58.580 --> 01:17:01.340
And, they won’t say anything to you.

01:17:01.340 --> 01:17:04.430
But in any case, they won’t see anything,
I hope so.

01:17:04.430 --> 01:17:08.140
Next time when you come don’t bring any
nonsensical thing like the one you brought

01:17:08.140 --> 01:17:09.210
last time.

01:17:09.210 --> 01:17:14.560
First was My television set the way it was
ruined.

01:17:14.560 --> 01:17:17.469
It’s all absurd ideas, I never do like that.

01:17:17.469 --> 01:17:19.239
You need not try to avoid paying customs.

01:17:19.239 --> 01:17:25.480
We have to pay where you have to pay.

01:17:25.480 --> 01:17:31.270
So, whatever you are bringing, each person
should not bring more that five hundred rupees

01:17:31.270 --> 01:17:32.530
worth, means about say, about twenty-five
pounds.

01:17:32.530 --> 01:17:36.150
Secondly, that whenever you bring such things
like tapes you should divide them into different

01:17:36.150 --> 01:17:37.150
people and then bring it.

01:17:37.150 --> 01:17:38.150
Don’t bring them together.

01:17:38.150 --> 01:17:39.150
Thirdly, whatever you bring you don’t send
it back without asking Me.

01:17:39.150 --> 01:17:40.150
There’s no logic in it.

01:17:40.150 --> 01:17:44.990
All the way you bring something here and why
do you send it back?

01:17:44.990 --> 01:17:48.960
Again, this is the same brain I think which
I cannot explain.

01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:50.950
Nobody can explain this.

01:17:50.950 --> 01:17:53.440
Yen, who took them back?

01:17:53.440 --> 01:17:55.430
[Yogi’s answer is inaudible]

01:17:55.430 --> 01:17:58.930
Shri Mataji: Who is he?

01:17:58.930 --> 01:18:01.110
From Bristol?

01:18:01.110 --> 01:18:04.310
You know we have paid for that.

01:18:04.310 --> 01:18:05.460
[Yogi’s answer is inaudible]

01:18:05.460 --> 01:18:06.610
Shri Mataji: But why?

01:18:06.610 --> 01:18:08.340
English originals, why did you send?

01:18:08.340 --> 01:18:11.200
You see, you are made in-charge of that, have
you?

01:18:11.200 --> 01:18:13.100
Who has made you in-charge?

01:18:13.100 --> 01:18:15.380
Warren made you in-charge, did he?

01:18:15.380 --> 01:18:17.270
Then, did you ask Warren?

01:18:17.270 --> 01:18:23.150
You don’t know you have sent also in that,
I had saved some tapes which were the bhajan

01:18:23.150 --> 01:18:24.150
tapes.

01:18:24.150 --> 01:18:28.740
I saved them that time when I was giving.

01:18:28.740 --> 01:18:32.270
I said, “Keep them for the villagers.”

01:18:32.270 --> 01:18:36.341
I’m saying did you appoint him as the in-charge
of the tapes?

01:18:36.341 --> 01:18:37.341
All right.

01:18:37.341 --> 01:18:39.530
What, he didn’t do these tapes.

01:18:39.530 --> 01:18:44.530
The tapes that he has sent back, he never
did it.

01:18:44.530 --> 01:18:46.350
That’s done by Paul.

01:18:46.350 --> 01:18:50.590
We have purchased them, gave it to Paul for
doing it.

01:18:50.590 --> 01:18:56.340
Now, I saved these ones when I was giving
the presents to people.

01:18:56.340 --> 01:18:58.690
I said, “Save these.”

01:18:58.690 --> 01:19:04.239
Because I have to take them for distribution
for the villagers and these tapes were sent

01:19:04.239 --> 01:19:05.239
back.

01:19:05.239 --> 01:19:06.239
He never asked Me.

01:19:06.239 --> 01:19:07.690
See, this is the trouble.

01:19:07.690 --> 01:19:13.470
When you are in-charge, doesn’t mean you
can do things like that.

01:19:13.470 --> 01:19:18.040
These are not your tapes that you sent them.

01:19:18.040 --> 01:19:23.120
We paid for it, we got it done through Paul.

01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:26.420
It has nothing to do with you.

01:19:26.420 --> 01:19:29.630
You never did these tapes.

01:19:29.630 --> 01:19:30.630
Nothing.

01:19:30.630 --> 01:19:32.840
No, you did not.

01:19:32.840 --> 01:19:34.120
I know.

01:19:34.120 --> 01:19:36.050
Paul did it.

01:19:36.050 --> 01:19:56.070
It was given to Paul, we paid for it, we asked
Paul to do it.

01:19:56.070 --> 01:20:00.940
He did it.

01:20:00.940 --> 01:20:12.330
These tapes are not done by you.

01:20:12.330 --> 01:20:18.560
If you have done it I don’t know but as
far as I know, they are done by Paul.

01:20:18.560 --> 01:20:24.630
And, I kept them back, I didn’t give them.

01:20:24.630 --> 01:20:32.790
Yesterday, I was really crestfallen because
I had told them that I’ll give it to the

01:20:32.790 --> 01:20:33.790
bhajan-mandals.

01:20:33.790 --> 01:20:38.640
And, it was not there.

01:20:38.640 --> 01:20:47.350
They asked Me, “Where are the tapes You
had promised us, Mother?”

01:20:47.350 --> 01:20:49.230
[Yogi’s answer is inaudible]

01:20:49.230 --> 01:20:54.950
Shri Mataji: I think you do not know because
I had kept about forty tapes or thirty tapes

01:20:54.950 --> 01:20:57.610
which were of Indian bhajans separately with
that.

01:20:57.610 --> 01:20:59.280
But what was the hurry?

01:20:59.280 --> 01:21:05.290
If you have to send something, you can always
send it later.

01:21:05.290 --> 01:21:07.989
[Yogi’s answer is inaudible]

01:21:07.989 --> 01:21:12.040
Shri Mataji: How do you know?

01:21:12.040 --> 01:21:14.420
You just sent the lot.

01:21:14.420 --> 01:21:15.420
How do you know?

01:21:15.420 --> 01:21:16.530
You didn’t see everything.

01:21:16.530 --> 01:21:20.380
Definitely, they are gone but why do anything
without asking?

01:21:20.380 --> 01:21:23.460
First of all, always do things with asking.

01:21:23.460 --> 01:21:25.760
You shouldn’t behave arbitrarily, first
point.

01:21:25.760 --> 01:21:29.610
Second point is that these things can be done
later.

01:21:29.610 --> 01:21:30.670
What is the hurry?

01:21:30.670 --> 01:21:35.949
Even Warren asks Me if he has to do something.

01:21:35.949 --> 01:21:39.080
Is a very common thing I know with the Western
mind.

01:21:39.080 --> 01:21:40.080
I’ve known that.

01:21:40.080 --> 01:21:42.320
I’ll tell you people used to live in My
house, they would just walk off keeping the

01:21:42.320 --> 01:21:44.090
door open, just walk off.

01:21:44.090 --> 01:21:45.150
Where’s he gone?

01:21:45.150 --> 01:21:46.150
God knows!

01:21:46.150 --> 01:21:47.150
He’s walked off.

01:21:47.150 --> 01:21:48.150
Very common.

01:21:48.150 --> 01:21:49.150
He just walked off.

01:21:49.150 --> 01:21:50.480
Where did he go?

01:21:50.480 --> 01:21:56.730
I mean, even if we have to go the bathroom,
we’ll tell somebody, “I’m going to the

01:21:56.730 --> 01:21:57.730
bathroom.”

01:21:57.730 --> 01:21:59.830
That’s our habit.

01:21:59.830 --> 01:22:05.790
No, it’s all right whatever it is but I’d
saved these.

01:22:05.790 --> 01:22:10.540
Now, I cannot locate it because it’s not
there.

01:22:10.540 --> 01:22:15.830
There was no need to send them back at all.

01:22:15.830 --> 01:22:17.450
What was the hurry?

01:22:17.450 --> 01:22:18.460
To whom are you committed?

01:22:18.460 --> 01:22:23.910
If not to Me, at least to Warren.

01:22:23.910 --> 01:22:27.620
Why they arranged these things?

01:22:27.620 --> 01:22:32.090
I think something goes out there.

01:22:32.090 --> 01:22:33.090
You better look after yourself.

01:22:33.090 --> 01:22:34.840
You have to do sadhana.

01:22:34.840 --> 01:22:37.620
You all must do sadhana.

01:22:37.620 --> 01:22:48.021
There’s one more thing: is that by saying
I’m a Sahaja Yogi, by believing I’m a

01:22:48.021 --> 01:22:53.230
Sahaja Yogi, you are not going to be helped.

01:22:53.230 --> 01:22:54.700
You have to do your meditation sincerely.

01:22:54.700 --> 01:22:56.690
You see, I know it’s not hypocrisy.

01:22:56.690 --> 01:22:57.690
But also it is not all out sincere effort.

01:22:57.690 --> 01:22:58.690
There’s something in between, the limbo
I would say.

01:22:58.690 --> 01:22:59.690
That’s not the way.

01:22:59.690 --> 01:23:01.740
We think we are Sahaja Yogis.

01:23:01.740 --> 01:23:04.110
All right, then do it.

01:23:04.110 --> 01:23:09.890
You have to everyday; all these Indian Sahaja
Yogis meditate everyday.

01:23:09.890 --> 01:23:10.890
Everyday.

01:23:10.890 --> 01:23:14.930
They are much more in a way evolved.

01:23:14.930 --> 01:23:17.489
They have a much better background.

01:23:17.489 --> 01:23:20.050
We have to fight all that.

01:23:20.050 --> 01:23:22.610
Everyday, they cannot live without it.

01:23:22.610 --> 01:23:23.610
All right?

01:23:23.610 --> 01:23:29.590
Now, try to meditate, try to take out because
you have problems there.

01:23:29.590 --> 01:23:32.540
That’s how you go off.

01:23:32.540 --> 01:23:36.710
Now, just don’t do anything arbitrarily,
ask ten people.

01:23:36.710 --> 01:23:38.570
I also ask you.

01:23:38.570 --> 01:23:40.880
I don’t do anything arbitrarily.

01:23:40.880 --> 01:23:48.100
Yesterday, when all the leaders were there,
I asked them what is to be done, isn’t it,

01:23:48.100 --> 01:23:49.100
Warren?

01:23:49.100 --> 01:23:50.100
Asked everyone.

01:23:50.100 --> 01:23:53.420
I can do everything Myself, I don’t do that.

01:23:53.420 --> 01:23:58.640
It’s a collective thing, you cannot do anything
like that.

01:23:58.640 --> 01:24:02.780
All right, that’s one thing now.

01:24:02.780 --> 01:24:04.580
Thank you very much.

01:24:04.580 --> 01:24:06.219
Next time, don’t do anything.

01:24:06.219 --> 01:24:14.070
It’s not only him, I’m telling all of
you.

01:24:14.070 --> 01:24:15.400
Don’t do anything arbitrarily.

01:24:15.400 --> 01:24:16.400
All right?

01:24:16.400 --> 01:24:17.400
May God bless you!

01:24:17.400 --> 01:24:18.400
Now, second is Felicity, come here.

01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:19.400
Felicity, you sit down.

01:24:19.400 --> 01:24:20.680
I have to tell you one thing.

01:24:20.680 --> 01:24:25.470
In Sahaja Yoga, you have come here to achieve
an ascent.

01:24:25.470 --> 01:24:32.140
You know you had lots of problems.

01:24:32.140 --> 01:24:36.110
You have not come here to achieve any positions,
know that.

01:24:36.110 --> 01:24:42.250
If you want to achieve positions, why don’t
you go to politics and spare us?

01:24:42.250 --> 01:24:46.611
You become ministers, prime ministers, do
what you like.

01:24:46.611 --> 01:24:50.150
Why do you want to start another center?

01:24:50.150 --> 01:24:51.870
[Answer is inaudible]

01:24:51.870 --> 01:24:52.870
Who is Danny?

01:24:52.870 --> 01:24:54.739
Is he you leader?

01:24:54.739 --> 01:24:56.630
Who is your leader?

01:24:56.630 --> 01:25:00.360
Then, why did you listen to Danny?

01:25:00.360 --> 01:25:02.550
Danny will do that.

01:25:02.550 --> 01:25:04.420
He’s gone back, he’ll tell you, he’ll
try to break your organization.

01:25:04.420 --> 01:25:08.570
Are you going to listen to him?

01:25:08.570 --> 01:25:10.750
He will do like this.

01:25:10.750 --> 01:25:19.170
You should have told him in all sense that
you better talk to Lori.

01:25:19.170 --> 01:25:21.770
Now, don’t listen to Danny.

01:25:21.770 --> 01:25:24.900
He’s already gone off his head.

01:25:24.900 --> 01:25:30.120
Actually, he made a horrible thing which you
can’t imagine.

01:25:30.120 --> 01:25:34.810
I mean, if I tell you, you’ll be shocked.

01:25:34.810 --> 01:25:36.290
He made a deed.

01:25:36.290 --> 01:25:40.320
He made the deed for the so-called registration
of the Vishwa Nirmala Dharma.

[Shri Mataji asks a Yogi] That one or the
other one also: Life Eternal Trust?

01:25:47.580 --> 01:25:49.420
[Yogi’s answer inaudible]

01:25:49.420 --> 01:26:04.430
You can say Life Eternal Trust and what he
did was that when I die he becomes the head.

01:26:04.430 --> 01:26:11.430
He becomes the head of the whole of the world,
Mr. Danny.

01:26:11.430 --> 01:26:14.180
That his great wife has achieved it.

01:26:14.180 --> 01:26:22.000
And, when he [Shri Mataji points to one of
the Yogis sitting there] found it out, he

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:29.560
told Me, “Mother, what are You doing?”

01:26:29.560 --> 01:26:31.410
I trusted him, he’s such a good man.

01:26:31.410 --> 01:26:37.000
I don’t know how he got into this trap of
getting some sort of a power.

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:38.580
Can you do that?

01:26:38.580 --> 01:26:39.580
You cannot.

[Conversations in Marathi]

You have to support Lori out and out.

01:26:52.430 --> 01:26:57.090
I must get good report about you from her.

01:26:57.090 --> 01:26:59.580
You know you had terrible problems, you know
that.

01:26:59.580 --> 01:27:02.400
I must get very good report from her.

01:27:02.400 --> 01:27:04.520
And, you must respect your leaders.

01:27:04.520 --> 01:27:06.280
Don’t treat them as equals.

01:27:06.280 --> 01:27:16.400
None of you are going to treat your leaders
as equals, you have to respect them and you

01:27:16.400 --> 01:27:22.950
have to listen to them.

01:27:22.950 --> 01:27:27.739
If something goes wrong with them, I will
remove them.

01:27:27.739 --> 01:27:29.750
Don’t start arbitrary behavior.

01:27:29.750 --> 01:27:34.280
This goes to this limit what Danny has done.

01:27:34.280 --> 01:27:39.580
Do you want to become like that?

01:27:39.580 --> 01:27:47.230
So don’t start any arbitrary behavior.

01:27:47.230 --> 01:27:54.220
And, if you want to make Me unhappy, I have
nothing to say but I’ve tried to make you

01:27:54.220 --> 01:28:02.380
happy by so many ways and so many methods
but if you want to make Me unhappy all the

01:28:02.380 --> 01:28:03.770
time, what can I do?

01:28:03.770 --> 01:28:06.220
I have to be unhappy.

01:28:06.220 --> 01:28:11.590
You don’t want to make Me unhappy, isn’t
it Felicity?

01:28:11.590 --> 01:28:16.520
All right, now go ahead and don’t do all
these things.

01:28:16.520 --> 01:28:17.960
It hurts Me.

01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:20.830
I mean, I just don’t understand.

01:28:20.830 --> 01:28:25.670
You have been with Me for so many days and
this thing, I’ve loved you so much, just

01:28:25.670 --> 01:28:26.670
can’t understand.

01:28:26.670 --> 01:28:28.960
Why do you want to hurt Me?

01:28:28.960 --> 01:28:30.710
All right, get up now.

01:28:30.710 --> 01:28:34.780
Now for something nice, we should say it’s
done is done, finished.

01:28:34.780 --> 01:28:49.500
You see, sometimes the ocean of forgiveness
gets so filled up that some of it like what

01:28:49.500 --> 01:28:57.660
you call the tushar in Marathi we say.

01:28:57.660 --> 01:29:02.640
I don’t know in English what is the word
is.

01:29:02.640 --> 01:29:06.080
Some drops come out from that on the shore.

01:29:06.080 --> 01:29:16.320
Try to love each other, try to be helpful
to each other, try to enjoy others – that’s

01:29:16.320 --> 01:29:18.100
what you are here for.

01:29:18.100 --> 01:29:25.300
Keep to your age, keep to your levels, keep
to your growth and also, you must understand

01:29:25.300 --> 01:29:36.540
that respect if you give, you get the respect
also.

01:29:36.540 --> 01:30:29.270
This is not the way one should behave in Sahaja
Yoga.

01:30:29.270 --> 01:30:50.980
I’m trying to build up a new world.

01:30:50.980 --> 01:30:54.960
You are doing God’s work.

01:30:54.960 --> 01:31:07.370
Just find out have you got sufficiently enough
understanding what work you are taking.

01:31:07.370 --> 01:31:16.350
Arbitrary behavior is absolutely cancerous
for Sahaja Yoga.

01:31:16.350 --> 01:31:24.920
Anybody does that, you point it out to others,
“This is arbitrary.”

01:31:24.920 --> 01:31:29.010
This has been done very much before also.

01:31:29.010 --> 01:31:33.140
You know how the money was collected arbitrarily
by Patrick.

01:31:33.140 --> 01:31:38.960
Terrible things happened and everybody supported
him, even Steve and everyone and people sent

01:31:38.960 --> 01:31:41.080
him money without asking Me.

01:31:41.080 --> 01:31:42.770
This is very sad.

01:31:42.770 --> 01:31:58.020
You are all Sahaja Yogis of such a level and
you must come up to that level and see that

01:31:58.020 --> 01:32:07.330
you are the people who are going to change
the whole world.

01:32:07.330 --> 01:32:14.770
You are the foundation of that.

01:32:14.770 --> 01:32:24.370
No arbitrary behavior should be there but
an understanding because you have to receive

01:32:24.370 --> 01:32:28.900
so much.

01:32:28.900 --> 01:32:36.340
Unless and until, you are respectful, you
cannot receive anything.

01:32:36.340 --> 01:32:41.120
Whatever you have to do please ask your leaders.

01:32:41.120 --> 01:32:43.850
Don’t do anything arbitrarily.

01:32:43.850 --> 01:32:56.030
The leader may be younger than you, may be
older than you, may be now he is appointed,

01:32:56.030 --> 01:32:58.920
you are an old Sahaja Yogi.

01:32:58.920 --> 01:33:04.710
Doesn’t matter, I know whom to appoint,
I’ve appointed that person there.

01:33:04.710 --> 01:33:06.590
All right.

01:33:06.590 --> 01:33:15.110
I hope you will give Me joy and happiness
as I have always tried to give you.

01:33:15.110 --> 01:33:16.290
May God bless you!

01:33:16.290 --> 01:33:22.450
Now, the ladies have arrived and they want
to give bangles to the ladies.

01:33:22.450 --> 01:33:29.930
They have brought the bangles for you.

01:33:29.930 --> 01:33:38.450
The reason is tomorrow is a great day, what
we call the Sankrant.

01:33:38.450 --> 01:33:43.860
Is a day when the Sun changes its meridian?

01:33:43.860 --> 01:33:49.200
It moves from the South to the North, towards
the Cancer.

01:33:49.200 --> 01:33:52.550
It moves towards the Cancer, you see.

01:33:52.550 --> 01:34:10.740
And, that’s how tomorrow is a very great
day for us, fourteenth.

01:34:10.740 --> 01:34:24.219
That day we say that that’s the day lots
of things happen.

01:34:24.219 --> 01:34:29.090
So, San Krant.

01:34:29.090 --> 01:34:35.340
Krant means revolution and San means holy.

01:34:35.340 --> 01:34:58.910
So is a day of holy revolution.

01:34:58.910 --> 01:35:08.380
Luckily we are here, we’ll be having a nice
puja, we’ll have an international puja also,

01:35:08.380 --> 01:35:12.330
everything will be done tomorrow very nicely.

01:35:12.330 --> 01:35:42.050
Now, one thing we have to do today that these
ladies have come to give bangles to you, to

01:35:42.050 --> 01:35:43.690
all the ladies.

01:35:43.690 --> 01:35:47.250
They have got all sizes.

01:35:47.250 --> 01:35:55.440
They showed Me what sizes I should take.

01:35:55.440 --> 01:36:35.840
I told them some of them should

01:36:35.840 --> 01:36:36.840
be maximum.

01:36:36.840 --> 01:36:37.840
[laughter] And, they’ve brought it.

01:36:37.840 --> 01:36:45.969
So as many as you can have, please have it.

01:36:45.969 --> 01:36:48.170
All right?

01:36:48.170 --> 01:36:50.370
[applause]

01:36:50.370 --> 01:37:16.010

it is insulting.

When

01:37:42.530 --> 01:38:11.989
the men don’t go for
a fight or they behave cowardly then women

01:38:11.989 --> 01:38:48.590
offer their bangles to men that, “You better
wear them, sit at home and I’ll go on

01:38:48.590 --> 01:38:57.070
the war.”

01:38:57.070 --> 01:39:08.530
There’s a saying, “Bangadya bhara.”

01:39:08.530 --> 01:39:42.170
Means to men if you say that

01:39:42.170 --> 01:39:52.660
that means now you are a coward.

01:39:52.660 --> 01:40:02.449
Means that in all languages.

01:40:02.449 --> 01:40:15.640
It’s a sanctuary here, so many birds.

01:40:15.640 --> 01:40:37.110
Have you seen those birds before or only they
have arrived today?

01:40:37.110 --> 01:40:49.320
Just go

01:40:49.320 --> 01:41:03.210
and have

01:41:03.210 --> 01:41:04.800
a look.

01:41:04.800 --> 01:41:19.750
We have everything by the kilos, you see.
