Shri Virata Viratangana Puja. Los Angeles (USA), 10 October 1993

3
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:07,800
Today, we are going to celebrate

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:12,720
the puja of Virata and Viratangana.¶

5
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,000
North America and South America,

6
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:37,040
as you know is the Shri Krishna’s center of Vishuddhi.

7
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:45,480
And it is very important to know also

8
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,440
that all the communications,

9
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:54,720
all the relationships with the whole creation

10
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:00,160
has to be established through this center of Vishuddhi.

11
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:06,000
Vishuddhi, as you know is the most important center

12
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,920
in your ascent, in a way.

13
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:17,040
Because Sahaja Yoga is not only meant for your ascent

14
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:20,560
but for the ascent of the whole world,

15
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:25,840
and only through Vishuddhi you can achieve it.

16
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,240
Even if you get your self-realization

17
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:38,800
and you get all the powers,

18
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:44,080
unless and until you use your Vishuddhi, it won’t work out.

19
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,720
Look at my Vishuddhi also,

20
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,000
talking, talking everywhere, keeping communications,

21
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,400
Vishuddhi goes out!

22
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:02,840
Also, this Vishuddhi chakra being so important,

23
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,840
it is under attack.

24
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,920
Attack of the negative force.¶

25
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:23,520
Today we are going to worship Virata and Viratangana.

26
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:27,960
Virat is the ultimate,

27
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,960
the complete development of the Vishuddhi chakra is Virata.

28
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:36,680
And as you know the chakra is here

29
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,880
here at this point.

30
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:46,400
If this chakra is not all right, you are not collective.

31
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:50,840
You behave in a manner that is not collective.

32
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:57,960
You cannot communicate with other Sahaja yogis.

33
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:06,520
You cannot be friendly, loving and one with other Sahaja yogis

34
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:13,120
unless and until the center of Vishuddhi is all right.

35
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:16,400
And it is part of Ekadesha.

36
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:21,280
Vishuddhi is the center of the Ekadesha Rudra.¶

37
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:36,760
So one has to understand that Virata Shakti is spread all over.

38
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,320
We have communications.

39
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,280
Mean I could telephone from here to anyone

40
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,840
and they told me they don’t charge much.

41
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:50,520
You see something also from Shri Krishna’s blessing, I think.

42
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,920
Because you telephone from anywhere else it is very difficult,

43
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,560
and very expensive.

44
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:04,280
Also, most of the communications vehicles

45
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:11,880
like computer, like television, other things also,

46
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,960
all those so many of them were developed in this country.

47
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:23,720
So it is the subtle of that Ether

48
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,440
which communicates us to other worlds.

49
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:36,520
That is one power of Virata.

50
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:40,080
That he is the subtle of that.¶

51
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,360
The second power which we have

52
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:53,680
of Viratangana we can say because Virat is

53
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:59,720
the kinetic force of but the source is Viratangana,

54
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:10,760
is everything that brain can do.

55
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:26,960
All thinking, all creativity, all compassion,

56
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:39,200
all kinds of looking after other nations.

57
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,400
The other day somebody asked,

58
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,200
“Why should we be policemen of the whole world?”

59
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,880
You jolly well have to be,

60
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:51,440
because, you are Viratas.

61
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:56,800
So you have to look after the law and order of the whole world.

62
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,000
You have to look after

63
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:04,040
all the people who are suffering in this world.

64
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,080
You have to look after all the suppressions

65
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:13,840
and the wars and all the civil wars everywhere,

66
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,640
is all your headache,

67
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:22,320
because you are sitting in the land of Virat.

68
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:27,520
So He’s the Father.

69
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,840
He’s what you call Jehovah.

70
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,240
He’s Akhbar.

71
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:44,440
So on the brain level

72
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:52,040
when Kundalini reaches and enlightens your brain

73
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,640
then this science that you know

74
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:07,000
becomes logical not only that but you know meta science

75
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:13,680
because the brain which was just knowing science

76
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,920
now knows the source of science.

77
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:22,560
The whole thing it can see, clearly.

78
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:29,320
Like you climb up a hill or a mountain,

79
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:37,520
the higher you go you can see the whole vision of the place.

80
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:44,440
In the same way whatever is created out of your brain, anything,

81
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:50,680
you start getting the whole vision of it what they have created.

82
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,960
Not only that but you also see what has created that.

83
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,840
Now they created United Nations.

84
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,920
It had to be here, Why?

85
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,520
Why in America?

86
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:11,360
Why is America so much worried about United nations?

87
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:17,560
What is its responsibility.

88
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,520
No country will do that.

89
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,480
It’s a headache.

90
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,800
But they’ll go to Vietnam,

91
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,720
they’ll go to Korea.

92
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,571
Now they are busy with Bosnia.

93
00:08:27,692 --> 00:08:30,932
Everywhere, Somalia.

94
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:35,200
It’s your responsibility

95
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:40,000
because all these things are created by your brain.¶

96
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:44,200
The human brain has created different nations.

97
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,440
So above all we realize that all these nations

98
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,720
belong to all one world.

99
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:58,120
Once you rise above you see that this was created by us,

100
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:03,600
by our own thinking, by our own projections we have created.

101
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:15,720
So when you go above this you start thinking of one world,

102
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:19,400
because you see that it was one world.

103
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,400
It is one world.

104
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:28,520
You start seeing God has created beautiful rivers

105
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:35,680
and beautiful mountains, He never divided.

106
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:39,440
I mean He wanted to create beauty for you.

107
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,240
But then we started thinking

108
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,520
“This is my land, that is my land.”

109
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:49,600
Most of the Americans have come from the outside,

110
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,400
and the real land owners I don’t know where are they hiding.

111
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,320
I seldom see them.

112
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:00,040
Now the responsibility is coming in their heads

113
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,600
that we have taken this land

114
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:11,760
and we feel that this is our land

115
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:15,280
but it belongs to the whole world.

116
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:19,200
Whatever they have done now is coming back.

117
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,200
Once you rise higher you start seeing the vision.

118
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:27,120
Whatever you have done through your mental projections.

119
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:30,880
People don’t even realize in many countries

120
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,720
that this is one world.

121
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:42,560
Mental projection is on another level

122
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:49,000
is that you have created a materialistic world.

123
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,120
With this materialistic world

124
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:58,800
you have reduced everything to the level of money.

125
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:03,520
Religion is money, everything is money.

126
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:09,840
Nobody has any respect for anything but for money.

127
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:17,320
And then material things.

128
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:25,280
One starts seeing matter as a source of wealth

129
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,320
and source of dignity

130
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:38,160
and a source of great positions, powers.

131
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:48,000
But when you rise higher into Virata’s power

132
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,440
you see the stupidity of materialism.

133
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:57,520
What is matter after all?

134
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:05,240
Matter is for making the place beautiful,

135
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,040
giving you joy,

136
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:19,160
and this matter is also for expression of your joy to others.

137
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,800
When you give them some present,

138
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,600
some material thing beautifully made.¶

139
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,320
Then you start thinking also

140
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:34,160
how God has created this beautiful world

141
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:42,720
and you start creating beautiful things

142
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:52,880
in art, in music, drama, even films, everything.

143
00:12:54,880 --> 00:13:01,600
But at the material level and at the mental level

144
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:05,480
the projection is linear; it moves like this.

145
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,480
As a result, it falls down.

146
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:15,040
So everything, the standard of our expression has fallen down.

147
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:20,320
I know films in the twenties and thirties and forties

148
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,240
from the same Hollywood

149
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,360
were very different from what they are today.

150
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:28,600
You can’t even see some of them.

151
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,720
Then in the same mental projection

152
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:39,080
we see the dramas and the novels and the art,

153
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:44,120
everything has come down, is deteriorated,

154
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:51,240
is not at all joy giving but it is destructive.

155
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,960
It is destroying itself, first of all,

156
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,480
and so it is destructive.

157
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,520
As a result, we are moving our mind

158
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,680
and moving on that decline also

159
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:09,560
and we also take to things which are destructive.

160
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:14,000
Our standards in everything have gone off.

161
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:17,680
Morality also is an innate blessing to human beings

162
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:24,560
but he starts putting it on a mental level.

163
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,400
When you put it on a mental level

164
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:33,360
people like Freud become Christ,

165
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,720
and you start following them

166
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:40,480
and you become nothing but a sex point.

167
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:47,960
In every direction if you see there’s a big decline

168
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:53,920
and you get upset, you don’t understand,

169
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:57,520
how there is such a decline in human nature,

170
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:01,840
how there is a decline in art, decline under treasure,

171
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,240
decline on human relationships,

172
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:08,360
in everywhere you find this decline.

173
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,120
With money of course, certain things

174
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,680
may appear to be smart, fast, like tennis you can say.

175
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:21,640
People used to play tennis for joy, never for money.

176
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,440
But now they play for money and

177
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,360
after four, five days we find he has gone down,

178
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,040
or four, five years he is finished.

179
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:41,680
So the speed has come also into sports because of money.

180
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:45,560
This money has been like a big load

181
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:55,680
has brought down all the beautiful things in its own level.

182
00:15:55,800 --> 00:16:00,360
They are not the same level at which they are created.

183
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,560
If it was on the same level,

184
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:06,880
Sahaja Yoga would have worked very nicely in America.

185
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:13,000
But it did not, because here is the maximum load

186
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:20,560
on all our creations of our mind of our mental projections.¶

187
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,920
Whatever direction you will see

188
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:27,520
you will find there is such a decline.

189
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:32,960
We know of lawyers who would be so honest

190
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:37,840
and who would work out something

191
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,720
for the person for whom they are fighting.

192
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:43,720
But today you can bribe the lawyers.

193
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:52,480
You know the doctors which would go all out to cure patients,

194
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:57,480
they have lost their sense of ethics.

195
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,200
Everybody has lost their sense of ethics.

196
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:10,400
First is this materialism, money and above all I think

197
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:17,080
at this time there is a big growth of people

198
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:20,880
because this is the resurrection time.

199
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,320
And many types of people are born.

200
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:27,840
Thousands and thousands of them are born

201
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:31,280
who might be like animals or maybe

202
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:37,920
some sort of absolutely idiotic type

203
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:41,720
or maybe some stupid stuff.

204
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,880
At this time, we have to do resurrection work,

205
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
means what, that our Virata Shakti

206
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:54,040
has to be enlightened in our brain.

207
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:12,480
So in Sahaja Yoga when you rise into Virata Shakti

208
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:19,320
you go up and see all these declines,

209
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:26,240
all these falling mental projections, from that height.

210
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:29,520
And also you see yourself.

211
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:35,840
That you had gone into all these nonsensical things,

212
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:39,120
but now you feel that you have come out of it

213
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:43,200
and now you have become like a lotus.

214
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:46,120
Especially the ego part.

215
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:52,840
Ego is extremely strong in modern times. It was never so.

216
00:18:54,720 --> 00:19:03,960
It is, I think the birth of many fighting cocks

217
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:09,240
has come on this earth and also

218
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:14,720
some of the jungle creatures are also reborn.

219
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,720
Because you can’t talk to them.

220
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,280
If you say anything they just jump on you.

221
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,040
You cannot criticize them,

222
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,160
you cannot tell them what’s wrong with you,

223
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,680
they’ll just sit on your head,

224
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,120
if you say anything they’ll start hitting you.

225
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:31,040
They never want to see what’s wrong with them.

226
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:36,560
It’s impossible to communicate to them because of their ego

227
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:42,920
and this ego has come because of certain

228
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:46,880
declining nature of the modern time.

229
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,600
For example, from childhood

230
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:59,320
a mother starts scolding his child for spoiling her carpet.

231
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,920
So carpet becomes more important.

232
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,680
So the next day the child gets very angry,

233
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:09,720
he gets the scissors and cuts the carpet

234
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,760
to punish the mother.

235
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:21,200
Then they see that the child wants money for something

236
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,040
and they ask him for what.

237
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:27,080
“Because I have seen in the television

238
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,200
there is a bear which has a birth date.”

239
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:36,200
So a new type of devil has come up they are entrepreneurs

240
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,040
and through their mental projections

241
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:42,200
they take out novel ideas,

242
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,960
see like a teddy bear which has a birth date,

243
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,560
can you imagine, such a stupid idea.

244
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:53,080
And all the children wanting to buy that.

245
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,560
Now if one child buys another must have.¶

246
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:00,640
All kinds of things these entrepreneurs do.

247
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:04,600
And people start becoming slaves of them.

248
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:09,600
Like in Paris they started a fashion

249
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:13,840
that you’ll have six inches of skirts.

250
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,200
So all other skirts were thrown away.

251
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,600
The six inches skirts started.

252
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,160
Imagine in that cold, they would wear socks

253
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:26,360
and six inches of skirts. Everybody looks the same.

254
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,960
What is so beautiful about it.

255
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:33,360
Whatever they want the entrepreneurs so called,

256
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:40,280
they are called as artists, also as designers,

257
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:45,840
but their designs are just to kill your freedom,

258
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:49,360
just to make you a slave.

259
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:55,080
And all kinds of monkey tricks they play, which you accept.

260
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,960
Once you start accepting those monkey tricks,

261
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:06,960
then you don’t also realize that how you have become a slave

262
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:11,320
and there is no individuality about it.

263
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:17,480
Hairstyle they will start particular hair style.

264
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,320
So everybody goes about with the same hairstyle.

265
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,440
Or you go to a hairdresser.

266
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,040

267
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:40,560
So when you rise into your Virata Shakti

268
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:44,360
by the enlightenment of the Kundalini,

269
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:51,840
the Viratangana is the power which gives you

270
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:59,240
a complete vision of the decline

271
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:05,600
into which every mental projection

272
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:13,440
which was idealistic, beautiful has fallen.

273
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:22,600
For example, Abraham Lincoln gave a great idealistic idea

274
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:28,800
about a state, about democracy.

275
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:33,800
But now many people say that it is demonocracy.

276
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:38,600
Those people who were in Russia, of course they were wrong,

277
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,680
but still they had an argument

278
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:45,120
that we don’t want to become democratic

279
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:51,040
because look at America.

280
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:56,520
Nothing is safe, nothing is normal,

281
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,240
so what’s the use of becoming democratic country.

282
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:07,600
Can you hear me there, it's all right! it's all right.

283
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:16,520
After all we are on a picnic, you see.

284
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,480
And we cannot have any problems

285
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:29,240
because I told him whatever is here is here,

286
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:32,280
and whatever is not, is not here.

287
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,480
So if you have any problem, we can’t help it.¶

288
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:49,160
So you rise to that level, gradually, gradually,

289
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:52,800
first, I don’t know what you see.

290
00:25:54,400 --> 00:26:00,280
But you start seeing what’s wrong with your society,

291
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:07,480
what’s wrong with your relationships.

292
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:12,680
Ultimately, you start seeing what’s wrong with you,

293
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:16,120
how you are wrong.

294
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:20,920
That I would say is the higher state

295
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,520
where you reach and you start seeing

296
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:26,240
"This is wrong with me".

297
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:36,760
After that you start understanding

298
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:44,680
that you have got powers, Viratangana’s powers.

299
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:49,640
You have got powers.

300
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:54,280
In your brain itself, you have got powers.

301
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:09,280
By which you understand the Meta Science,

302
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:15,520
science above science, the meta art.

303
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:21,720
The vulgarity of art. Discrimination starts working,

304
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:27,080
you start understanding what is really art, what is not.

305
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,160
You start enjoying that art.

306
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:38,360
And the enjoyment of Niranand,

307
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:45,280
you get it when you rise above and see

308
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:49,240
the whole thing in a different perspective.

309
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:57,400
First of all, you see it as a drama, as a witness.

310
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:02,240
And you laugh, you see.

311
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:07,920
I was telling a joke about a lady who was interviewed

312
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:12,720
for doing some art with a mehndi on the hand.

313
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:15,720
She’s an Indian lady from India.

314
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,480
So the interviewer asked her,

315
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:23,920
“What about the foreigners, how do they react,

316
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,440
the Americans, how do they react?

317
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:31,280
She said that they ask very funny questions.

318
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:35,240
Funny questions? Yes, they ask me, “What is this?”

319
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:40,120
So I said, “This is my Suhaag,

320
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:47,440
my husband’s symbol, that's what I wear.”

321
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:52,640
So they said, what about extras?

322
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:57,080
“You didn’t follow?”- What about the extra husbands if you have?

323
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,000

324
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:04,320
Now you all are laughing, you all Americas are laughing,

325
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,800
but at that time point you would not have laughed,

326
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:09,000
because very common.

327
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,160
In the same way, everyone,

328
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:21,440
even India or any place where they do absurd things

329
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:28,880
it becomes very obvious and you start seeing it very clearly,

330
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:35,960
very very clearly that what are we doing, it’s all absurd.

331
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,320
But this is not only on mental level.

332
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,320
This is what I am going to tell you.

333
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,640
It is not just you see the vision,

334
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:49,440
all right, still mental level,

335
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:54,360
then you understand it is wrong, still mental level.

336
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,600
But you just don’t do it.

337
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:04,680
You become part and parcel of Virata.

338
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:12,360
When you become part and parcel of Virata then

339
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:19,640
you don’t have to even think, you just see it, then you laugh.

340
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:23,000
You just see and you know it is wrong.

341
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:26,360
It is all absurdity.¶

342
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:36,560
We went to see one temple in India

343
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:42,160
and there were some pujarees, doing puja.

344
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:45,720
So the Indian Sahaja Yogis ran out.

345
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,480
I said, “What happened?”

346
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:51,560
“Mother, they are all hypocrites, they are horrible vibrations,

347
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,560
how can they do puja,

348
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:56,600
they have horrible vibrations, all bhoots.

349
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:06,760
That’s how we become so powerful,

350
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,480
I would not say you are like a light,

351
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:15,400
because light doesn’t see the light does it?

352
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:22,880
But you see, you are light and you see light.¶

353
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:32,480
And the third thing that happens to you with this Viratangana

354
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:39,360
that you humble down. You humble down.

355
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:46,640
You become extremely sweet, obedient,

356
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:49,280
just like children.

357
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:54,760
And you don’t mind anything, anything you don’t mind.

358
00:31:56,680 --> 00:32:05,000
That is the state you achieve not as a slave,

359
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:13,600
not out of domination, but it just works in you,

360
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:22,440
it penetrates into your brain, you become that.

361
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:27,000
I’ve seen people who are horrid absolutely,

362
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:31,040
and after some time you can’t even recognize them.

363
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:35,000
How do they change?

364
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:39,320
How do they get the change?

365
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,480
What happens to them?

366
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:48,640
Is the brain is enlightened, has become the light

367
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:51,640
and you know you have the light.

368
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:55,000
That is doubtless awareness.

369
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:58,000
You should have no doubts about yourself,

370
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:01,040
that you are a Sahaja Yogi.

371
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:04,000
Some people falsely have.

372
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,840
They are bhoots but they say no we are Sahaja Yogis.

373
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,480
That’s not the thing.

374
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:16,720
The discretion power becomes so beautiful

375
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:20,320
of the Hamsa Chakra, because they are all connected,

376
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:23,840
the Vishuddhi, Hamsa and Virata.

377
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:28,560
They are all connected centers.

378
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:32,440
It is not only that the Virata improves,

379
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:36,760
but the Vishuddhi improves and Hamsa.

380
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:43,520
So now what happens that you jump into collectivity.

381
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:48,680
Collectivity is the blessing of Viratangana.

382
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:57,720
She teaches you how to love each other.

383
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:03,800
She teaches you how to enjoy other Sahaja Yogis.

384
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:12,520
She teaches you how to have bhakti in your heart.

385
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:21,360
But that teaching is like innate.

386
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,640
If I say She teaches, means you are the disciple

387
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,800
and She is the teacher, No, No.

388
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:32,160
You become Viratangana yourself.

389
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:38,040
And the love and the affection and the understanding

390
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:42,720
that you have for each other is remarkable,

391
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:46,840
is very enjoyable and very beautiful.

392
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:50,040
So all that happens,

393
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:54,240
absolutely happens in your brain.

394
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:59,480
That’s how your brain, which is

395
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:04,840
the one which receives all the information

396
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:08,680
and creates all the information,

397
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:12,520
creates all the mental projections

398
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:18,440
becomes a new vehicle to create a dimension

399
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:22,080
which goes higher, not declining.¶

400
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:28,200
All of you are part and parcel of that, all of you

401
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:33,440
are part and parcel of that and all of you are important.

402
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:36,160
All of you have to support that,

403
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:38,600
all of you have to raise it.

404
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,240
It is very important;

405
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:48,120
you all should understand your own responsibility.

406
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:53,760
So between South and North America

407
00:35:53,880 --> 00:36:00,280
we have to at least have 16,000 Sahaja Yogis.

408
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,240
Krishna was very clever,

409
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:14,560
He created his 16,000 powers into ladies.

410
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:19,960
Then these 16,000 women were taken away

411
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:25,320
by one king and he just kept them.

412
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:30,840
So Shri Krishna went and defeated that king

413
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:37,440
and brought all the 16,000 powers to himself, very nice.

414
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:40,760
He could do all those tricks, not Me.

415
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:46,560
I have to have 16,000 children who are human beings

416
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:50,600
and who get this power within them.

417
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:56,240
Not like my own powers I manifest. What is the use?

418
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,600
You can’t give realization to others,

419
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:02,600
you can’t communicate to others you can’t do anything with them.

420
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:07,040
So Shri Krishna only told Gita, finished.

421
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:12,280
They were clever people, they didn’t want to face the problem.

422
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,480
It’s very difficult.

423
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:19,200
You people have a bad Vishuddhi, I get it.

424
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:22,160
You people have a problem, I get it.

425
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:24,920
It's just collectively to work out.

426
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:29,360
To take you inside my body as a cell

427
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:34,680
and to cleanse it, it’s very very difficult task

428
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,160
but one has to do it.

429
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:41,920
One has to do it and one will do it.

430
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:46,760
I’m sure one day when you all will be

431
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:52,600
completely aware of Viratangana power within yourself,

432
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:56,720
I don’t know what will happen to this country.

433
00:37:56,840 --> 00:38:01,720
As it is I find it is just bubbling now, about to break.

434
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:05,800
It’s a big breakthrough I find this year,

435
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:13,640
among Sahaja Yogis as well as among the other people.¶

436
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:17,440
But there was another quality of Shri Krishna

437
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:22,520
was diplomacy, is to be diplomatic.

438
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,320
With others you have to be diplomatic.

439
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:29,560
You should not just jump on them and try to oppress them,

440
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,680
or in any way try to show them

441
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,640
that they are nowhere compared to you, No.

442
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,520
You should say that we were like you, worse than you.

443
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:40,840
Then people are happy. But see now we have changed.

444
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:45,040
Somebody says that “I was smuggling drugs

445
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:49,600
you should say no I was smuggling even arms”.

446
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:56,560
Then their ego will not be hurt,

447
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:59,200
if their ego is not hurt then it’s easy.

448
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:02,240
So diplomacy also you must learn.

449
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:06,400
Also Diplomacy is a mental projection at a lower level.

450
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:15,280
At a higher level diplomacy is where is your charisma,

451
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:19,800
where you attract people, where you capture them.

452
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:24,000
How you talk to them, how you behave towards them.

453
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:27,280
And also have a compassion, because

454
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,400
you are now sitting on the Himalayas,

455
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,640
but what about these poor people.

456
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:35,480
In that way if you see the whole thing I am sure

457
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:39,880
you will not feel so much

458
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,440
that you are doing this work and that work.¶

459
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:52,040
Shri Krishna’s whole philosophy is like this.

460
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,840
That you should get your “Ghyana”.

461
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:58,600
Ghyana is Ghy means Gnostics,

462
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,480
you have to be Gnostics means

463
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,520
on your central nervous system

464
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:06,200
you must know it. That’s the first thing.

465
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:11,120
The second thing was because Arjuna was so half-hearted,

466
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:14,640
still he asked him questions.

467
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,800
So he said,

468
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:35,800
“What about Karma? Everybody talks of Karma.”

469
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,560
Again diplomacy.

470
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,960
The whole Gita is full of diplomacy

471
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:45,400
and normal human beings can’t understand.

472
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:51,760
So he said, “Yes of course, you must do your Karmas,

473
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:58,200
but you have to surrender your karmas at My Lotus Feet.

474
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,800
No not possible.

475
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:06,720
Very clever because as long as you have

476
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:10,720
“I am doing this, I am doing that” idea,

477
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:15,480
how can you put your karmas onto the feet of Shri Krishna.

478
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:19,160
That means you should get your realization

479
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:22,480
where you know you that you are not doing anything.

480
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:25,600
When that happens that you know you are not doing anything,

481
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:31,600
at that time the Karma becomes Akarma.

482
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:36,160
And how you talk, I’ve seen people raising Kundalini

483
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:38,840
saying, “Mother, it doesn’t rise, it doesn’t work.

484
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,760
You don’t say that, “I am doing it.”

485
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:45,120
You just say, “It doesn’t rise, it doesn’t work out.”

486
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:49,840
in the third person. Another is about Bhakti,

487
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:56,320
because now we have lots of these Hare Ram’s, Hare Krishna’s

488
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,520
spoiling their Vishuddhi.

489
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:04,480
So for Bhakti He has used only one word.

490
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:10,600
He says, “You give me flowers, you give me water,

491
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:13,840
you give me leaves, I’ll take them.”

492
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:16,560
But while giving what does He say?

493
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:20,040
“But you must do “Ananya Bhakti”.

494
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:23,600
“Ananya” means when there is not the other,

495
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:27,600
when you become one with Me, when you are connected.

496
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:30,680
On “Ananya” word he has danced

497
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,520
the whole thing and these stupid people don’t know

498
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:37,080
that they are not connected as yet and they are talking

499
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:41,880
about Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Hare Rama.

500
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,160
That’s how they are not connected.

501
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:47,120
They don’t understand that they have to be connected.

502
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:51,840
And this is the trick he has played with all the people

503
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,480
that “All right, all right

504
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:58,480
you go on saying Hare Rama, Hare Rama we’ll see.”

505
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:05,040
So the diplomacy part in his case because

506
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:10,560
He had to bring them to the point that

507
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:14,080
No, No, this doesn’t work out, No this doesn’t work out.

508
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:17,880
So then “Gyana. Now what is Gyana is they start reading books,

509
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:23,800
No, No. It means 'bodh', means on your central nervous system

510
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:28,680
you have to go. So how gradually he brought them to that level.

511
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:31,760
In the same way when you are dealing with others

512
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:34,560
you have to work it out that way.¶

513
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:37,800
And once you work it out that way,

514
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:40,880
you can spread Sahaja Yoga much faster.

515
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,160
You’ll be a very light person,

516
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:45,360
everybody will enjoy you

517
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:48,800
and you’ll have no temper, nothing.

518
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:54,800
We get into temper because

519
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:57,680
we don’t know how to handle the situation.

520
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:59,920
If we know how to handle the situation

521
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:02,200
we’ll never get angry, on the contrary

522
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:06,720
use the anger of another person for your own benefit.

523
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:12,760
All these things you learn through the power of Virata.

524
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:19,640
Viratangana gives you the full detachment

525
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:24,680
from every subject of worry.

526
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:31,480
She sucks in all this and throws them in the air.

527
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:43,280
It is Her great power that has really given you

528
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:48,080
such an understanding about life, about yourself.

529
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:51,920
Your own value system has changed.

530
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:57,800
If you see what a change it was for you,

531
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:05,320
all this transformation, everything is the power of Viratangana.

532
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:10,920
And ultimately what She gives you is “Nirananda”.

533
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:20,440
Is the joy, joy and nothing else but joy.¶

534
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:24,480
May God bless you.¶

535
00:45:48,673 --> 00:45:49,919
(Shri Mataji compliments Gregoire.)¶

536
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:55,480
I must give full credit here to Gregoire

537
00:45:55,600 --> 00:46:02,320
because he came and struggled and fought and like Arjuna you see,

538
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:09,040
he felt very desperate and went away.

539
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:12,560
He had to go also in any way.

540
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:16,720
And suddenly as he is gone,

541
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:21,840
I find here is everything so sprouting, so well

542
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:26,320
and people have started taking over the responsibility

543
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:29,480
of working out Sahaja Yoga.

544
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:33,520
But I still remember him at this time

545
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:37,120
because he was really very desperate

546
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:44,440
and absolutely fed up with the American style of thinking.

547
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:47,760
But now we’ll give him a very good news

548
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:53,480
that how America has improved.

549
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:07,480
We have many Sahaja Yogis in America

550
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:09,520
who have been very dedicated

551
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:13,280
despite all kinds of negative forces and everything.

552
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:16,400
With all the nightmares they have gone through,

553
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:19,160
they are stuck on to Sahaja Yoga

554
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:26,520
and I find that their efforts are now showing results.

555
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:31,240
I will not take their names

556
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:34,440
because you know all of them very well one by one.

557
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:40,640
But I must say that Steven has done a great contribution.

558
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:44,280
I never asked him to come to America.

559
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:50,240
But he himself decided and he himself came here on his own

560
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:56,800
and he has really contributed a lot to Sahaja Yoga by coming here.

561
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:58,240
May God Bless You.¶

562
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:13,560
Of course, your leader is there

563
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:17,280
and all the leaders in everyplace

564
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:20,760
have been really working very hard

565
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:28,080
and I just see how things are prospered in one-year time.

566
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:30,600
It's very creditable.

567
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:34,040
We never had so many people for the Puja.

568
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:39,360
I am quite surprised as all of you being here.

569
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:40,880
Thank you very much.¶
