00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.920
A very simple understanding should be that

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.320
why are we in Sahaja Yoga?

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.720
We are in Sahaja Yoga to ascend,

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.760
to go higher and higher, as you sang yesterday.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.520
It was very entertaining yesterday the way

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:29.640
you talked about your ambition to be higher and higher,

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.800
really it was very joy giving, no doubt.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.280
But what are we doing about it?

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.120
What are we trying about it, we should see.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.400
Seriously we must think, are we meditating?

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:50.840
Are we all doing something to elevate others also,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.120
to give Realisation to others?

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.520
Specially women, I've seen, don't do much of this,

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.920
which is very bad, because you are the mothers.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.400
You have to go all out to give Realisation to others,

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.800
but men are more active that way and women are not.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.200
So, it works the other way round.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.800
Now, on one side, the men are, I think, are active,

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.360
but don't meditate,

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.800
women meditate and men do the outside works,

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:27.480
sort of a part time or you can call it a good labour division

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.400
that you meditate at home and we'll go all out.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.320
It's not going to work out.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.240
So, one has to meditate

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:42.880
and one has to also go out to spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.080
Both things have to be done.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.320
Supposing now, you meditate and you don't spread Sahaja Yoga,

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.680
you will never ascend,

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.480
because after all this Kundalini, you see,

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.680
She is a sensible woman, She is very sensible.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:07.840
She thinks: "Why should I make her a saint, what is the use?"

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.240
Sahaja Yoga is not individualistic.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.800
It's not for one person to become a saint

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.480
and sit somewhere. It's not like that.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.320
It's not meant for one person, for oneself,

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.360
it's not individualistic.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.720
It's a collective happening.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.040
So, if you are not helping to the collective,

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.040
Kundalini says: "Alright, you are alright as it is!"

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.800
Just like our body:

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.600
see in our body, if one organ says:

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.720
"Alright, now I'm alright, I'm not going to work out."

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.040
Or one cell says that: "I'm not going to now grow,

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.360
it's alright, why should I worry about the whole body?" It won't.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.160
It's a living, it's a living organism!

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:52.920
I have told you 100 times,

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.440
when it is a living organism, it has to grow,

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.400
it has to grow and also to absorb.

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.280
To have energy, you have to meditate and you have to grow.

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.360
If you don't grow, you are finished,

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:09.880
you are no more a Sahaja Yogi.

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.240
I wouldn't call a person a Sahaja Yogi

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.320
who has not even given one person Realisation.

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:18.720
Cannot be a Sahaja Yogi!

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.800
Sahaja Yogi has to give Realisation to others.

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.960
Apart from other activities, the main activity

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.040
should be how we give Realisations to others.

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:35.640
Unless and until we really look after that side of life,

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:40.120
we can never, never grow in Sahaja Yoga.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.560
For example, now take My position,

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.640
I'm alright, I'm complete, I have no problem.

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:53.160
But why did I work so hard

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:57.240
and wanted so many Sahaja Yogis? Why?

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.520
I don't have to grow either, I'm overgrown already.

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.640
I don't have to do it, but why?

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.880
What is the need? The need is like this,

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.280
the need is of love.

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.640
I have so much love that I have to canalize it.

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:18.720
If I don't, I'll suffocate. I can't love Myself.

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.240
So this love has to spread.

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.720
For that, I have to have you people who can

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.040
take this love to others and make them happy.

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:33.360
This is a kind of a vision I have,

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.720
and in this special time,

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.960
it was promised by many people, by many saints

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:46.000
and it is so obvious that your are all specially chosen

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.960
for this kind of thing.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:53.800
Now, how far you understand your importance is a different point.

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:04.720
You do for your emancipation, alright you meditate,

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:09.320
but if you are not canalizing the love,

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:12.360
the Divine love, what is the use?

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.280
Now, supposing I repair something very nicely,

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.560
I repair this machine nicely,

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.400
put it right, everything and I don't speak,

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.760
what is the use of having this?

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.520
In the same way, if you work very hard...

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:31.720
I know people who get up at four o'clock, have their bath,

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:34.040
do meditation, sit down.

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:37.960
In the night again, they sit down for meditation,

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.600
but they never go out,

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:42.360
they never talk to others,

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.320
they never spread Sahaja Yoga,

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:46.880
they do not give Divine love to others,

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:51.960
so how can this great problem of this world

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:55.080
be solved that it has no love,

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:58.200
it has never known Divine love.

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:04.280
It has to be given to them,

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:08.440
they have to feel this Divine love,

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:13.760
this power of Adi Shakti.

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:16.080
They have to know it,

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:19.080
otherwise you have been selfish, I would say,

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.800
that you had a nice time, having all this

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:25.720
and you have not given to others.

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:30.360
This is the reason why Sahaja Yoga sometimes fails

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:35.960
to create a proper balanced personality in a human being.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:40.240
Some people are like this, that now supposing,

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.880
a Sahaja Yogi has married another Sahaja Yogini,

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:45.080
take a position like that.

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:48.480
Now, My desire is that they should develop

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:51.960
a complete understanding of each other, love for each other,

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:58.160
but love for Sahaja Yoga and for others.

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:06.200
This is the only way we can justify marriage in Sahaja Yoga.

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:09.520
Otherwise why should they marry?

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:12.280
But it doesn't happen like that.

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:14.600
What happens is that first they are married,

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:18.440
then either they will quarrel,

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:21.160
they will ask for divorce.

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:23.720
If that doesn't happen luckily,

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:27.360
-because in Sahaja Yoga it's so easy to get married, you know-

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:29.320
if that doesn't happen,

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:33.600
then they start having their own family,

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:36.960
their own homes, becoming very small,

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:42.160
very, very small, very limited.

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:46.200
Did you come to Sahaja Yoga for that?

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:50.240
You have to realize your responsibility.

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:55.240
See this Mother Earth, how She knows Her responsibility.

00:07:55.400 --> 00:08:00.280
She is just made out of nothing but soil and mud,

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.040
but look at Her

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:05.400
how She is conscious, how She is particular,

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:08.480
how She works it out, how She is attentive,

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:10.200
how She is careful.

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:14.400
While you, though you have been blessed so much

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:17.880
by everything, you are, are you thinking

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:20.840
of giving it to others?

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:27.480
With twelve disciples, whatever was the problem of Christianity,

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:31.080
it's not a good job, I must say, but still

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:35.240
Christianity spread out.

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:40.320
Islam was not a very good job either, it spread out.

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:43.520
All those bad jobs have spread out so much.

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:47.440
So why not the good job of Sahaja Yoga?

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:51.880
It has to spread, it has to go to various places.

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:56.200
Try and find out where you can go and talk about it

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:58.440
and do something good to others

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:01.320
and help them somehow

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:06.880
to rise above this common existence

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:11.840
of misery, unhappiness and destruction.

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:13.920
The time is very short

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:17.200
and, I think, if you see the time,

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:21.960
the rate at which we are moving is not proper.

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:23.840
We have to be much faster,

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.640
we have to go much ahead

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:31.240
and we have to create much more Sahaja Yogis

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:39.720
through our consistent, very intensive effort.

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:44.080
But it's a side issue, by the way,

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:45.960
Sahaja Yoga is by the way.

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:50.040
And this is where we are failing in our responsibility.

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:52.800
We have to learn from the Mother Earth.

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:56.320
You might say that: "Mataji, how can we be like You?

00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:59.560
After all, You are Adi Shakti!" Many people say like this.

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:00.720
"You are Adi Shakti." "So what?"

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:04.720
"You see, with one finger you can move things like that!"

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:10.480
But why should I? Why should I? What is the need?

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:16.560
So in that reflection that you are Me,

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:21.520
in that reflection that the Mother Earth is Me,

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:26.480
in that beautiful creation within you,

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:30.880
you have to become very sensitive

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:36.680
to the need of the world. What is the need of the world?

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:41.840
Today, if you fail, the whole thing will fail forever.

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:44.880
Only very few will be there.

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:50.360
So the need for you is to spread Sahaja Yoga,

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:55.040
because this love is not only for you,

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:57.800
is not to be enjoyed by you,

00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:00.960
but is to be enjoyed

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:05.600
by as many possible in whole world.

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:09.160
So, today we have to decide that

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:12.000
as the children of Adi Shakti,

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:14.800
we have to go all out,

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:17.600
everywhere, every corner,

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:23.120
we have to shout, and we have to tell loudly

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:27.280
what is the time in which we are living

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:31.760
and what is the responsibility

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:39.400
that you have to fulfil as Sahaja Yogis.

00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:43.600
There must be some reason why you are here.

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:46.560
Like in the beginning, Sahaja Yogis used to ask Me:

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:49.640
"Mother, was I this last life?

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:51.920
Was I Shivaji last life?"

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:55.840
I said: "What's the use?" You might have been anything,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.320
but what you are today is much higher, try to understand!

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:03.120
You might be, say, Napoleon,

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:08.360
you might be, say, one of the kings

00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:11.120
or maybe, or may be the queen from somewhere, so what?

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:16.080
What did they do? Did they raise anybody's Kundalini?

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:18.440
Did they have any power?

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:22.080
Even the disciples of Christ or even

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:24.880
Mohammed Sahib's disciples, anyone,

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:26.480
did they do it?

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:31.520
Did they have any understanding of Kundalini?

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:36.720
Did they have any love for others

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:39.640
that they should give them Realisation?

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:43.600
There were some Sufis, they never gave Realisation to anyone,

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:47.240
there were so many saints who never gave Realisation to anybody.

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:50.240
Mohammed Sahib never gave Realisation to anybody,

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:53.480
Gautam Buddha never gave Realisation to anybody,

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:54.560
think of it!

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:58.560
Christ never gave Realisation to anybody, anybody!

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:00.560
Krishna did not do it, Rama did not do it,

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:05.240
nobody, but you can do it!!

00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:07.960
You can do it

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:12.120
and you know everything about Kundalini.

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:13.960
It's a very big thing

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:18.720
because you are children of the Adi Shakti.

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:23.120
You are here and your Mother is here.

00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:30.320
It's a very, very fortunate thing for Me that you are here.

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:32.280
I'm very proud of you,

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:35.320
but again and again I have to tell you

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:39.720
that the work has to be with a faster speed,

00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:42.680
we have to move with a faster speed

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:46.040
and get more people to Sahaja Yoga.

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:50.600
It is rather, rather difficult for Me

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:52.960
to say something forcefully.

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:55.200
That's not My nature, you know.

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:58.680
Can't get into tempers and cannot get angry

00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:02.920
and I cannot forcefully say something to you,

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:07.080
But if you fail, then

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:11.720
only thing will be that you have failed Me completely.

00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:14.960
It means that, nothing less than that.

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:17.200
And if you don't want to do it,

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:20.920
then I would request all of you to take a vow today,

00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:24.760
that you spread Sahaja Yoga and you will talk about Sahaja Yoga,

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:26.440
know about Sahaja Yoga.

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:29.200
There are many who don't know anything.

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:33.080
Also it is very surprising, they are Sahaja Yogis, they don't know anything.

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:37.000
And don't create problems for Me like marriage:

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:40.320
"We can't now live with the wife, we can't live with the husband."

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:42.720
All sort of nonsensical problems

00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:46.040
people create for Me in Sahaja Yoga.

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:50.960
Are you here to create problems or to remove problems of people?

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:54.240
So, on the whole, we have done well, I must say,

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:59.360
but it's not the final, we have to work faster

00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:02.920
with more enthusiasm and joyfully.

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:04.720
You don't know what joy you get

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:07.160
when you give Realisation to somebody.

00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:13.240
The most joyful moment is when you give Realisation to others.

00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:17.240
Just try, you must try once, you'll enjoy it,

00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:19.520
and then you want more and more and more.

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:21.720
Now, after Sahaja Yoga, really,

00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:25.640
the want disappears into this desire that:

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:27.840
"My God, this man is going,

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:29.960
should I call him and give him Realisation?"

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:31.840
On the street, you'll feel like calling:

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.040
"Come here, come here, I want to give you something!"

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:37.640
You make him sit down and you give Realisation.

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:40.680
This will be your style, like mad, you'll say:

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:42.960
"Ah no! Look at this,

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:47.320
this gentleman is without any Realisation, let us give."

00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:50.200
You'll have to go to churches, to universities,

00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:52.680
you'll have to go to all such congregations

00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:56.040
where they have no idea about what they can achieve

00:15:56.200 --> 00:16:00.280
and then tell them without any fear, without any malice.

00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:02.720
You can talk to them and you should tell them:

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:05.560
"Now, we are here to help, for your good,

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:08.200
we have not come for our good but for your good,

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:12.760
now listen to us!" And I'm sure, very sure

00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:15.680
that the Kundalini within you will be very happy.

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:17.160
She's not happy, you see,

00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:21.160
She's not happy with people who are not using Her fully.

00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:23.920
So, She'll be very happy to help you

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:29.320
and do the needful for the emancipation of the whole world.

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:33.560
May God bless you!
