00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.400
Last time I talked to you about collectivity outside your own shell,

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:20.040
how, after your Realisation, after your second birth,

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:28.860
you become conscious that you are no more an egg but, now,

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.880
you have become part and parcel of the whole.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.550
You realise it gradually.

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:46.140
In the beginning only what you feel is nothing but cool breeze

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.570
blowing into your hands or maybe little tingling sometimes

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.120
or maybe some heaviness, to begin with.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.770
But then, gradually you realise it.

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.590
Some people do realise it in a very quick way.

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:16.830
But as the infrastructure within is not properly fixed,

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.190
Realisation comes very, very slowly.

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:26.070
I spoke to you about our infrastructure within.

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:37.890
Now the faith in God or faith in anything that is Divine,

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:46.560
also in the Divine Power, is not easy to achieve logically.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.780
Some people have faith in God because they have been taught

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.220
from childhood that there is God.

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.610
Maybe they think that by relying on something like God,

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.090
somewhere in the air, they are doing better in life.

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.700
There could be many reasons why people have faith in God.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:15.440
But actually, when you feel the presence of Divine Power within you and outside,

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.000
it is hard to believe that it is the Divine Power.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:27.740
And even if you know all about it, it is difficult to assume it.

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.270
It’s sometimes a surprise to many Sahaja Yogis,

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:37.130
when they see around people who have got Realisation,

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.090
who have got cool breeze flowing from their hand and they disappear.

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.230
They just can’t understand such people that – how it has happened

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.890
that these people have come to a program, one day,

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.150
they have got Realisation, they have got cool breeze

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:54.440
and then they have disappeared?

00:02:54.734 --> 00:03:00.290
Are they the people who are little-believers or half-baked

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:01.700
or mediocres?

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:07.220
Or what is it that they have no curiosity any further to go?

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:14.840
Or that they are not intelligent enough to understand that there’s something

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:21.830
very dynamic, something very new, very natural that has happened to them?

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.700
It is not a cult, they can see for themselves,

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.680
because as in a cult there’s a mass hysteria

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.270
or some abnormalities, there’s no abnormality with these people,

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:36.170
they are very normal.

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.890
Despite all these things, all the proof to believe

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:45.770
that there is Divine Power around us and that now it is flowing through you,

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:47.334
it’s there.

00:03:47.334 --> 00:03:51.950
But still people don’t believe in it. Then why? What is the reason?

00:03:51.950 --> 00:04:00.770
We have to see what is the reason why we are not able to still accept

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:05.289
that this is what it is.

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:12.620
The time when great incarnations were on this Earth,

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:18.770
when people like Mohammed and people like Christ, Gautam Buddha,

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:23.105
all these people came on this Earth – very recently I should say –

00:04:23.105 --> 00:04:28.790
nobody believed that they are incarnations or they are Son of God.

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:32.930
I mean this is the only problem they had – to accept that He was Son of God.

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.960
I mean this was the only problem they were struggling with, all of them,

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:41.450
whether they were Jews or Muslims and such communities,

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:44.330
they could not accept that He was the Son of God.

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.270
I mean what is the harm in accepting the situation.

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:51.080
Supposing He is the Son of God, after all there’s no property distribution

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:55.370
going on, there’s nothing like a will God has written that, “I’ll give it to my Son,”

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:56.750
that we should contest it.

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:59.495
But people could not accept it.

00:04:59.495 --> 00:05:06.320
Now one may say that, at that time, that nobody felt the cool breeze,

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:11.750
nobody felt the connection with the whole.

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:16.610
But today also, today also the situation is the same.

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:25.280
Situation is the same because of a single simple reason that:

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:30.800
we ourselves are not integrated, we ourselves are not part of ourselves.

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:39.410
Our mind is running one side; our body is running another side,

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:42.680
our heart is running in another direction,

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:47.660
our sense organs are running in a different direction,

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:51.200
our liver is functioning in a different way.

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:55.160
We are not at all integrated ourselves.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.310
And as long as this integration is not there,

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:02.600
even if you feel the Divine Power,

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:05.810
even if you see the working of the Divine Power

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:12.800
and mentally even if you accept that, “This is what is happening to us! It is there!”

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:18.260
And you see for yourself, even, the pulsation of the Kundalini,

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.520
the rising of the Kundalini, the breaking of the Sahasrara,

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:28.960
even then it is difficult to believe that Sahaja Yoga is the only way

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.630
to have your rebirth.

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:34.090
On this point some people will fizzle out.

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:38.800
The others will fizzle out that, “Why it’s Mother who has to do it?”

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:43.180
Then there could be other problems also with people that,

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:46.900
“Why didn’t happen to other people.

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:50.800
They had to work very hard and why didn’t they get Realisation?”

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:55.480
How the mind works it is something very amazing.

00:06:55.480 --> 00:07:05.260
And as I know all the permutations and combinations of human negativity

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.274
about his Realisation,

00:07:07.274 --> 00:07:12.250
I compassionately feel that it should be explained to them

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:13.300
why they do it.

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:18.550
I know it’s very frustrating sometimes and people feel so disgusted.

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:22.090
I have seen some Sahaja Yogis thinking that, it’s better to give up

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:25.390
and cancel England out of the map of Sahaj Yoga,

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:27.370
or cancel France out of the map of Sahaj Yoga.

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:30.370
But that’s not the way.

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:37.390
We have to understand that their own connections are not yet built-in.

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:42.460
For example, this machine on which I am speaking now,

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:45.400
is connected to the mains.

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:50.710
But if it is not connected within itself, it will not work out.

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:55.960
Both things are important, that it should be connected outside

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:58.090
as well as connected within.

00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:05.530
And that connection within is very, very much lacking in the modern human beings.

00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:08.560
There are many reasons for that.

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:11.860
First of all, a big movement started long time back,

00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:14.440
among human beings, to deny God.

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:19.060
To keep it, at the most, as a formal discreet stuff.

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:23.080
It’s just a formal thing, you see, you don’t talk of religion at all.

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:26.493
You go to church, come back home or you go to a temple, come back home,

00:08:26.493 --> 00:08:27.400
sit down.

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:30.460
You are a so-called Hindu or a Christian or a Muslim,

00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:33.250
or something like that, but don’t discuss it.

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:37.990
Because as soon as you start really discussing religion in the real way…

00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:41.170
I mean it’s easy to give a sermon sitting on a pulpit,

00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:48.790
but to allow it to be discussed and logically sorted out,

00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:52.120
it’s impossible to prove because it is mysterious.

00:08:52.120 --> 00:09:03.460
It is a tremendous power that works it out.

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:11.470
This tremendous power that works it out cannot be understood by normal human beings;

00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:12.280
cannot be.

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:17.980
The working of this is so dynamic and the dimensions into which it works out

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:23.680
is so great, that a human mind cannot understand it, a normal one.

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:26.650
Even a Sahaja Yogi, when he gets Realisation,

00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:34.630
is trying to understand, first, the dynamism of this Divine Power.

00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:39.610
And the dynamism of this Divine Power looks so simple, so simple,

00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:44.530
but they can’t believe it that it could be that simple.

00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:52.210
For example, if I say, sitting down here you can find out

00:09:52.210 --> 00:09:58.150
about anyone, the way his Kundalini is.

00:09:58.150 --> 00:10:01.120
I mean this is something people can’t just believe.

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:03.250
It’s too much for them to believe.

00:10:03.250 --> 00:10:08.800
So, suddenly if you are exposed to something so dynamic, so great,

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:13.360
so vast, so effective, so efficient,

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:18.580
it is impossible for human mind to understand that there’s such a great thing

00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:19.930
that existed all through.

00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:24.340
Because they never discussed it, they never talked about it.

00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:26.560
You are not supposed to talk about it and discuss it.

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:30.190
That’s the main thing. You cannot discuss religion.

00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:33.340
And how far do we discuss even science?

00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:37.300
Like they’ll say there is gravity in the Mother Earth. Alright.

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:39.220
What is the nature of gravity in the Mother Earth?

00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:44.147
How is it there? Why is it there? On that point – finished!

00:10:44.147 --> 00:10:45.940
Science doesn’t give that reason.

00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:50.080
They just say, “There is a pull of gravity in the Mother Earth.” Finished!

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:54.100
Beyond that, they do not want to discuss, they just say, “Alright, up to this point

00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:55.360
and beyond that nothing.”

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:59.950
So if you go to a man who is a priest or a religious man

00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:02.260
or one who is talking about religion he will say, “Oh that’s God’s mystery.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:06.760
That’s God’s mystery, we cannot go. That’s a mystery.”

00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:12.310
So, one says that “You cannot go beyond that, it is so, and that’s why we should not

00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:13.090
worry about God.”

00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:15.730
The another one says, “Alright, this is the mystery

00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:18.580
and the mystery we cannot unravel.”

00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:28.240
So, “I’m not a believer in a thing that exists,”

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:34.705
or “I am the believer of a thing that exists but I cannot explain it.”

00:11:34.705 --> 00:11:41.590
If you discuss a small thing like – how is it a particular flower becomes a fruit.

00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:46.420
That is not discussed, you see, in elite society, it is not to be discussed.

00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:50.350
At the most, you can talk about weather because there cannot be any quarrelling.

00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:54.790
Even a thing like Falkland Island should not be discussed.

00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:57.970
Maybe some Argentinean is sitting somewhere there, and he will be hurt about it,

00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:00.940
you see, or something might happen.

00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:03.940
So we are so careful as to what to discuss.

00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:11.020
But if people sit down and discuss it they will know that there is a tremendous

00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:14.500
working of the Divine Power around.

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:25.000
Can you count the amount of work it is doing? It’s an impossibility.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:31.180
Like a flower becoming a fruit. Now take only one type of a flower.

00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:32.890
How many there are in the whole world?

00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:39.400
I mean if you think of it you just feel that, “It’s too much.” We just cannot.

00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:44.110
How this Mother Earth is moving with such a tremendous speed

00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:46.360
and we are just settled down nicely here?

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:51.790
How many such suns and stars and constellations are moving?

00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:53.410
There’s no end to it.

00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:56.380
If you go to the microscopic side: just see the skin

00:12:56.380 --> 00:13:01.970
and you will be surprised that it is 1/16th of an inch has got such a beautiful,

00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:08.450
organised layer which works out all the five functions of the skin.

00:13:08.450 --> 00:13:11.300
It is tremendous!

00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:15.530
And when seeing all these things, in going into science,

00:13:15.530 --> 00:13:19.730
if man doesn’t want to realise that there must be a power

00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:22.130
that is doing all these organised things

00:13:22.130 --> 00:13:29.390
and there must be one organised personality or maybe a controlling thing

00:13:29.390 --> 00:13:34.220
that is working it out, then it means that they are trying

00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:37.430
to live with a myth because they cannot solve it.

00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:42.200
The myth is that there is no God.

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:44.180
This is the biggest myth I have ever heard.

00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:51.380
And to believe into such a thing that there is no God is just to accept,

00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:57.560
that as you are the highest of all, the lord of all the world,

00:13:57.560 --> 00:13:59.060
how can there be anybody higher?

00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:07.010
This is one of the biggest hurdles of human beings in the modern times.

00:14:07.010 --> 00:14:13.700
In the ancient times, olden times, it was so but it was not so much,

00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:18.860
to this extent that now man thinks that he is on top of the world

00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:23.483
and that he is the one who can guide the whole world and who can manage this

00:14:23.483 --> 00:14:24.620
and manage that.

00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:29.720
For example, I cured a patient about ten days back.

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:33.710
I shouldn’t say, “I cured,” because it just happened that she got cured,

00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:35.810
through Sahaja Yoga.

00:14:35.810 --> 00:14:38.750
And she went to the hospital and the doctors saw her.

00:14:38.750 --> 00:14:41.780
And they said, “No, it can’t be, how can you be cured?

00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:43.820
How can you say you are cured?” She said, “I am cured.

00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:45.920
I have no pain, nothing. I am perfectly alright

00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:49.370
and everything is functioning alright.” “But how can it be?”

00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:58.730
You see, not to accept anything comes from a fright that,

00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:02.480
if you accept something, if you accept that there is Divine Power,

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:06.920
then perhaps you may have no position, no significance.

00:15:08.530 --> 00:15:12.700
So to be compassionate to people who get Realisation,

00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:17.500
you have to tell them that, “It is not that you are overpowered

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:22.960
by the ocean, but you become the ocean. The drop becomes the ocean.

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:26.920
Not that the ocean overpowers you.”

00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:32.320
Then it may be that you can go further with the second step

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:37.240
where ego is little bit given assurance that, “You won’t be finished.”

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:49.030
The infrastructure has this one problem that, ego has separated all your inner being

00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:58.360
into different parts and anything that ego says or is pampered, is good.

00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:06.970
Good and ego’s happiness are regarded as equal to each other.

00:16:06.970 --> 00:16:13.540
Now, if you can overcome that first hurdle with people,

00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:17.860
that you become the ocean, that you become the guru,

00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:25.030
that you become empowered with your own powers,

00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:32.530
you have crossed some areas in a personality.

00:16:32.530 --> 00:16:36.280
And it’s a fact. To begin with, it’s a fact.

00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:43.075
But this area, actually, you get much later on.

00:16:43.075 --> 00:16:46.360
But better to promise that highest, you see.

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:52.030
Like people promise that, “If you do this, you will get

00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:55.330
the Kingdom of Heaven.” “Alright. Then what we’ll get?”

00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:59.110
“Then you will get the Kingdom of Europe.” “Then?”

00:16:59.110 --> 00:17:03.910
“Then you will get the Kingdom of England.” And like that, you see, it moves.

00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:08.950
But if you tell them that, “You will get the Kingdom of your own Self.”

00:17:08.950 --> 00:17:10.811
They will say, “What’s there?”

00:17:10.811 --> 00:17:15.040
“The Kingdom of your Self! Such an insipid stuff?”

00:17:15.580 --> 00:17:21.880
So you have to start from the big stuff, saying that, “You become your own guru.”

00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:27.190
Which is a fact! You do become your own guru.

00:17:27.190 --> 00:17:28.720
But that happens much later.

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:34.270
But still if you tell them directly that, “You become your own guru.”

00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:37.450
first, it will appeal to them.

00:17:37.450 --> 00:17:41.500
They can start thinking immediately, “Alright, if we become the guru,

00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:46.150
we’ll start a big cult, you see? We’ll have a big cult, we’ll have so much.

00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:49.810
I’ll also have Rolls-Royces, 58 Rolls-Royces

00:17:49.810 --> 00:17:51.550
and I can demand this and that.”

00:17:51.550 --> 00:17:54.040
All these things may start working in the mind of a person.

00:17:54.040 --> 00:18:00.340
Because the concept of a guru is also so nonsensical

00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:08.860
that it is not conceivable for people when you tell them,

00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:10.870
“You’ll become your own guru.”

00:18:10.870 --> 00:18:13.264
But if you tell them, “You’ll become your own guru,”

00:18:13.264 --> 00:18:14.560
they’ll feel happy.

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:18.100
And that’s the point you’ve missed I think John, the other day when you spoke,

00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:20.890
that, “You will become your own guru, that you’ll become.”

00:18:20.890 --> 00:18:22.360
But what does that mean?

00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:30.490
Actually that means that your own religion within you,

00:18:30.490 --> 00:18:33.640
your Ten Commandments within you will be enlightened;

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:38.020
that you yourself will be correcting yourself all the time.

00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:42.550
That means you will guide yourself. Nobody else has to guide you.

00:18:42.550 --> 00:18:45.250
You yourself will guide yourself. It means that.

00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:51.760
That you will have such a willpower that you will keep to righteousness,

00:18:51.972 --> 00:18:58.510
to correct living, to normal behaviours, to the middle path of life,

00:18:58.510 --> 00:19:04.180
to be compassionate, to be loving, to be honest and that all those things

00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:05.920
will come to you automatically.

00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:16.000
That you will give up all your bad habits. “You will become your own guru,” means that.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:22.720
And that is what when you tell them before, it would be dangerous.

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:28.310
So, I would say that, first of all, if you have to say in a way that,

00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:33.890
“You will become your own guru,” it should not be very much discussed

00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:34.970
and talked to people about.

00:19:34.970 --> 00:19:44.240
But it is a fact that, once our own Void or our own religion

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:48.410
within us, sustenance power, becomes enlightened,

00:19:48.410 --> 00:19:52.460
if you see the light of that, then you enjoy that light,

00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:55.310
you enjoy your virtues, you enjoy your righteousness.

00:19:55.310 --> 00:19:59.360
And that righteousness when you start enjoying it,

00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:03.095
you stick on to that. But that happens later on.

00:20:03.095 --> 00:20:07.790
The problem is at first only what you feel is tingling or maybe cool breeze.

00:20:07.790 --> 00:20:17.120
But this enlightenment of your sustenance happens later when you start enjoying

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:21.590
your virtues, enjoying the virtues of others, enjoying the righteousness.

00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:27.740
And that is what is a difficult thing among human beings.

00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:35.510
And because of this delayed action people don’t accept Sahaja Yoga.

00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:42.110
Because they want everything in a very fast way.

00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:49.310
If they could feel the joy of enjoying the virtues and the righteousness just then,

00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:53.990
then they would not ask any questions.

00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:59.795
But in the structure of man this comes later on.

00:20:59.795 --> 00:21:06.200
Though you have to unravel that screw before but it is put back the last.

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:22.100
When the Kundalini rises in the Void it goes through this central-most channel

00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:23.270
called as brahmanadi.

00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:32.450
Is the central-most among the three nadis, channels, in the central channel.

00:21:32.450 --> 00:21:38.360
The central channel is Sushumna and concentrically there are three channels

00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:41.030
placed and the inner-most is brahmanadi.

00:21:41.030 --> 00:21:44.420
The other two are called as Chitra and Charini.

00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:50.660
Now the first one, it just goes like a single thread of hair

00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:54.980
and pierces through the fontanel bone area.

00:21:54.980 --> 00:22:04.670
Now one may say that, “Why not…” You see we can blame God for this that,

00:22:04.670 --> 00:22:11.180
“Why not He had only one channel so that we could feel the impact

00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:13.130
of Realisation very fast?”

00:22:13.130 --> 00:22:20.720
But one has to understand that whatever God does is for our well-being

00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:23.900
and for our hita and for our understanding.

00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:29.210
If you go the other way round you see, that when we start hurting

00:22:29.210 --> 00:22:36.080
our central path of Sushumna we start from outside.

00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:41.870
Like, you see if you go to a wrong guru, to a cult or to a wrong thing

00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:45.560
where you bend your head or you have faith in something that is artificial

00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:52.100
then the first channel is broken, is hurt.

00:22:52.100 --> 00:23:01.820
Now supposing if the whole of the Sushumna channel was made of only one tube-like channel,

00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:04.310
then the whole thing would have been finished.

00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:13.745
So, the first one, the outer-most is first attacked by our stupidity that we do –

00:23:13.745 --> 00:23:19.160
is to bow to someone who is a fake person.

00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:23.390
Or we go to things, we believe in things who is fake.

00:23:23.390 --> 00:23:34.550
It is also harmed in the people who are very arrogant

00:23:34.550 --> 00:23:38.720
and think no end of themselves and they think that,

00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:40.520
“We are the lord of the whole world.”

00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:45.140
That, “We can teach everyone, and everybody else has just to learn from us!”

00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:50.630
That, “We are the best sect or the best organisation

00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:54.530
or maybe the best religion or ‘the chosen ones’.”

00:23:54.530 --> 00:24:06.290
Also there, first layer of the Charini is hurt.

00:24:06.290 --> 00:24:15.380
So, at the very gross level it is first hit by these two types of people.

00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:24.170
Now, the second one also can be hurt by people who practice

00:24:24.170 --> 00:24:27.792
all kinds of nonsensical things.

00:24:28.010 --> 00:24:32.840
Like I have met many Sahaja Yogis who have been to all kinds of nonsensical things

00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:40.940
and have practiced very perverted type of practices,

00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:47.360
very perverted, and all kinds of perverted ideas.

00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:52.160
Like, they will go to a cult – I have seen some people

00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:57.350
who have been to a cult, for example – and there it is preached

00:24:57.350 --> 00:25:03.440
that you should not even look at your wife, or some sort of a thing, nonsense.

00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:06.860
And they are having relations with other women.

00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:12.290
Like there’s another cult in India, I don’t know it is spreading here also perhaps,

00:25:12.290 --> 00:25:16.610
where people believe that you should never get married

00:25:16.610 --> 00:25:20.420
and you should lead a very chaste life, you should be virgins.

00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:25.490
But the virgins have – what you call to men virgins

00:25:25.490 --> 00:25:30.710
in English language? Oh whatever it is! I don’t know if you have any.

00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:36.350
But what you call them – men virgins, we call them brahmacharis and brahmacharinis.

00:25:36.350 --> 00:25:39.950
So the brahmacharis, you see the men virgins –

00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:43.940
I don’t know if you have any cult like that, but I think the priests are here

00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:45.740
like supposed to be brahmacharis.

00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:48.620
So the brahmacharis and the brahmacharinis

00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:53.090
should lead a life of complete celibacy and should not marry.

00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:56.210
They should not marry. Not that they should lead a life of celibacy.

00:25:56.210 --> 00:25:57.530
They should not marry.

00:25:57.530 --> 00:26:04.790
They should not marry, but there is no compulsion as to what sort of life

00:26:04.790 --> 00:26:05.450
you should lead!

00:26:05.450 --> 00:26:12.800
Now, it is such a contrasting thing! You should not marry for what?

00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:15.830
For leading a celibate life.

00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:19.070
And then with that what is the other contrast you have?

00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:23.300
Is that you are leading a bad life with other people!

00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:24.860
That’s allowed.

00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:32.210
These kind of perversions when we have in life, or all kinds of perverted things

00:26:32.210 --> 00:26:35.540
we are doing these days in modern times, all sorts of improper things,

00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:42.650
touches the second nadi which is the Chitra. I mean, I can’t even imagine!

00:26:42.650 --> 00:26:45.740
I don’t know so many things what human beings do, to what extent.

00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:48.680
But these are the buffer nadis outside.

00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:57.800
And that’s why there’s the very subtle one which is called as the brahmanadi

00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:00.800
is used by Kundalini.

00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:07.910
But first, to begin with, when She rises, She tests you and finds out

00:27:07.910 --> 00:27:10.640
what sort of an ascent She’s going to have.

00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:15.020
So, only a thread will rise first of all.

00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:22.250
Because supposing if there is a hit on say five, six threads they are hurt

00:27:22.250 --> 00:27:26.390
and then they become very weak and they fall down.

00:27:26.390 --> 00:27:36.350
So, a very subtle, one thread we can say out of that, comes up to pierce

00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:37.580
the fontanel bone area.

00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:41.670
Now this is the structure within us, which does this.

00:27:41.670 --> 00:27:48.930
Is done the same way as a seed sprouts or any living thing happens,

00:27:48.930 --> 00:27:52.710
like a flower becomes a fruit. It’s the same way. It’s a living process.

00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:57.510
So, when this one rises up and pierces the fontanel bone area,

00:27:57.510 --> 00:28:05.460
at that time, when there’s a little touch with the All-pervading Power,

00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:11.580
which is subtle, by our subtlety you start feeling this cool breeze in the hand.

00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:16.560
But still there are two more nadis surrounding it which have to expand

00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:19.260
and get more of the Kundalini coming up.

00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:25.620
So now we cannot blame God for this kind of doing

00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:28.320
because He knows that human beings are like this.

00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:37.680
We try all the time to ruin ourselves, morning till evening, in every way possible.

00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:43.350
Sometimes trying to please our ego or sometimes trying to please our superego –

00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:44.310
all our conditionings.

00:28:44.310 --> 00:28:50.610
First of all we never will accept any knowledge from anyone

00:28:50.610 --> 00:28:58.050
which is True Knowledge and we always want to try ourselves.

00:28:58.050 --> 00:29:07.140
Now anybody who talks to us with the authority, with that purity

00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:10.980
and with that holiness we don’t like such a person. We abhor!

00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:18.180
But anybody who plays upon our weaknesses, upon our ego and superego,

00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:24.000
who is really harming us and we are not aware

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.670
that we are harmed by these things, we are not aware at all.

00:29:26.670 --> 00:29:34.410
Like a person like Freud now: Freud must be a really of the category of Hitler.

00:29:34.410 --> 00:29:38.430
Hitler was on a very gross level but Freud was a subtler one.

00:29:38.430 --> 00:29:42.300
He has ruined human beings, absolutely!

00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:47.190
You can see that in Kundalini, how he has ruined the innocence of people.

00:29:47.190 --> 00:29:50.820
Their sense of shame, decency, decorum, which is a gross thing

00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:54.090
and by putting perversions into their heads

00:29:54.090 --> 00:29:59.130
now what we have are societies which are just like living like animals.

00:29:59.130 --> 00:30:11.130
And this is what one has to realise that the people who talk about harming us

00:30:11.130 --> 00:30:17.595
we accept them more than those who want to construct us.

00:30:17.595 --> 00:30:23.520
Now those who want to construct us will definitely tell you

00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:25.920
that this is not the way it has to happen.

00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:31.980
Because if they have real concern and real worry about you,

00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:33.960
they are not bothered about their cheap popularity,

00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:38.100
they are not bothered about pleasing you for anything,

00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:42.180
because there is no gain as such, except for the satisfaction

00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:45.600
that you have told the Truth to people.

00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:54.750
So this infrastructure that is within us, the more modern we become the worse it becomes.

00:30:54.750 --> 00:31:01.320
And this infrastructure, if it gets spoiling more, and more, and more,

00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:09.630
then it is an impossible task to communicate with them

00:31:09.630 --> 00:31:13.620
or to inform them of the Truth.

00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:17.490
Though they might feel cool breeze in the hand, they might get the experience

00:31:17.490 --> 00:31:20.010
and all that, but it doesn’t fit into their head.

00:31:20.010 --> 00:31:24.000
I have known people who have done that way

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:30.390
and sometimes it is amazing how thousands get Realisation

00:31:30.390 --> 00:31:35.700
and very few remain into that state where they want to gain

00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:39.150
the deeper significance of Sahaja Yoga.

00:31:39.150 --> 00:31:44.280
Unless and until they get to the deeper significance of Sahaja Yoga,

00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:48.650
they are not going to accept it. They are not going to recognise it.

00:31:48.650 --> 00:31:55.860
It’s a sad thing but it is so that, one has to touch the being very deeply

00:31:55.860 --> 00:32:01.350
because it’s a beautiful being which is being ruined by various things,

00:32:01.350 --> 00:32:04.380
as I have described to you. There’s no end to it.

00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:09.480
All these circumstances, keeping into view,

00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:14.730
one has to be very, very careful and compassionate towards people

00:32:14.730 --> 00:32:21.330
who are seeking and who are coming, because these are seekers of the ancient times

00:32:21.330 --> 00:32:22.942
they have been seeking.

00:32:22.942 --> 00:32:30.480
Now, as the time has passed, of course, the communication of the Divine has improved,

00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:33.180
definitely it has improved.

00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:37.950
Because you have seen that we can give mass Realisation,

00:32:37.950 --> 00:32:40.230
people can get mass Realisation.

00:32:40.230 --> 00:32:43.020
You have seen in India that it can happen.

00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:47.070
So the communication from the Divine Power has improved,

00:32:47.070 --> 00:32:50.760
but the communication from the human power is reduced,

00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:58.200
reduced and also is very much wounded.

00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:03.720
So if you see the Kundalini – I don’t know if you can see the Kundalini

00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:08.460
of some people or most of you – you will be amazed that it is really

00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:09.600
a wounded Kundalini.

00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:17.700
She has hit many points which has hurt Her. Because you didn’t respect,

00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:20.790
you didn’t respect Her.

00:33:20.790 --> 00:33:26.490
You did not know how to respect Her nor you could meet people

00:33:26.490 --> 00:33:34.380
who guided you properly how to respect that special thing

00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:38.820
that God has given you, the special blessing of this Kundalini

00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:39.780
which is within you.

00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:50.730
Is the primule, is a very tender thing, is so beautiful, it is eternal within you

00:33:50.730 --> 00:33:53.760
which has to rise and give you Realisation.

00:33:53.760 --> 00:34:00.480
Now this is your Mother, which is waiting for an opportunity to give you your Realisation.

00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:07.830
And this Mother has no way to come up because we have hurt the path

00:34:07.830 --> 00:34:11.280
through which She has to come and She is also jarred.

00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:16.260
I would say She is coiled like a tape within ourselves.

00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:20.550
This is the structure of this Mother.

00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:25.980
She is coiled in three-and-a-half coils and She has to rise you.

00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:43.020
Now think of a tape recorder which is put on a sea which is turbulent

00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:51.180
and sharks are eating it off and then it is burnt –

00:34:51.180 --> 00:34:55.560
all sorts of things that can be used to damage it have been done.

00:34:55.560 --> 00:35:03.870
Still it is quite intact. Of course there are little problems with it.

00:35:03.870 --> 00:35:05.670
It is still quite powerful.

00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:11.910
It is still expecting that great happening for which you are born,

00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:15.030
for which you are seeking, for which you are on this Earth.

00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:15.960
She’s there.

00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:24.810
You can’t think of any human mechanism of that delicacy, that sensitivity,

00:35:24.810 --> 00:35:30.630
that beauty, that understanding and that strength.

00:35:30.630 --> 00:35:33.960
It’s hopeful against hopes.

00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:41.130
And that is the thing still preserved there,

00:35:41.130 --> 00:35:48.712
because it is protected by your innocence which is still there, little bit left.

00:35:48.712 --> 00:35:53.280
You see whatever you may try with your innocence,

00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:59.220
as you cannot create a complete vacuum, you cannot get rid of it the whole.

00:35:59.220 --> 00:36:04.740
So whatever part is left of your innocence is guarding that

00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:10.590
and that essence is still waiting, is there.

00:36:10.590 --> 00:36:14.730
Whatever you might have done, whatever wrongs you might have done

00:36:14.730 --> 00:36:18.840
makes no difference because Kundalini is intact.

00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:23.640
But what is the problem is the other way round:

00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:27.570
that the mechanism of God is perfect.

00:36:27.570 --> 00:36:33.270
The mechanism of Divine Power to give Realisation to thousands

00:36:33.270 --> 00:36:38.490
is absolutely in perfect state. Absolutely, I can tell you.

00:36:38.490 --> 00:36:45.540
But to make your brains understand the importance of your Self,

00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:52.650
of your being, of your purpose, of your meaning, is difficult –

00:36:52.650 --> 00:36:54.570
because it is not integrated.

00:36:54.570 --> 00:37:01.200
Your heart does not know your brain and whatever happens to your heart

00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:02.760
is not communicated to your brain.

00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:08.610
If you reasonably see certain things and logically see something happening,

00:37:08.610 --> 00:37:13.680
still your heart may refuse if it’s a weak heart, if it has weaknesses.

00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:20.010
But the Kundalini has the beauty to strengthen your heart,

00:37:20.010 --> 00:37:23.700
to strengthen your brain, to strengthen your liver,

00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:28.005
to strengthen all your being, and to integrate it,

00:37:28.005 --> 00:37:30.120
but She must be given a chance.

00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:34.710
If you don’t give Her a chance, you are not fair to yourself.

00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:38.850
People are fair to others but when are they going to be

00:37:38.850 --> 00:37:39.660
fair to themselves?

00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:46.170
Ego is the not the way we are going to be fair to ourself

00:37:46.170 --> 00:37:49.440
because ego is a nonsensical horse on which we are sitting.

00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:55.470
It’s like John Gilpin’s horse which takes you round and round the places

00:37:55.470 --> 00:38:00.720
reaches you nowhere for your wedding day. It’s that kind of a nonsense.

00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:04.620
So if you are playing with John Gilpin’s horse

00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:08.940
and if you are satisfied with it and you think it’s a big fun,

00:38:08.940 --> 00:38:11.625
we are harming ourselves.

00:38:11.625 --> 00:38:19.440
So to get to the real point is that to understand what is our infrastructure.

00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:26.790
The outside one is alright. We import things in India.

00:38:26.790 --> 00:38:34.110
We can import anything for India but we cannot take it to the villages,

00:38:34.110 --> 00:38:36.420
we have no way to there, there’s no road.

00:38:36.420 --> 00:38:45.560
So that structure within us has to be built-in

00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:49.520
with our own coordination and cooperation.

00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:53.240
We have to cooperate with it.

00:38:53.240 --> 00:39:02.300
As God has taken all the care to build in the structure without, outside you,

00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:07.250
and also inside you He placed nice thing, and you were the trustee of that,

00:39:07.250 --> 00:39:11.720
you were in charge of that, but it is spoilt.

00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:18.950
So you must give time for this inner structure to come up.

00:39:18.950 --> 00:39:23.720
Now some people are unnecessarily frightened also.

00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:28.910
I have seen some people frightened of I don’t know what.

00:39:28.910 --> 00:39:36.770
Sometimes I think that we are frightened of too much of purity or all sort of things  I've heard of holiness

00:39:36.770 --> 00:39:39.980
or they are frightened of anything.

00:39:39.980 --> 00:39:48.050
For such people I would say they should read God’s words about it,

00:39:48.050 --> 00:39:49.880
that you should not be frightened.

00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:57.050
He is compassion, He is love and these things are there.

00:39:57.050 --> 00:40:02.000
These are not the words of somebody who is giving you a sermon.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:04.940
I am telling you the Truth. It is there.

00:40:04.940 --> 00:40:10.400
But you have to come up to that point to feel that beauty of that Truth,

00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:12.410
to enjoy that Truth.

00:40:12.410 --> 00:40:16.700
And once you start enjoying that Truth then there’s no problem for Me.

00:40:16.700 --> 00:40:21.080
There are some here sitting, quite a lot of them, who have felt that way.

00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:29.480
But you have to have understanding that the inner structure is still to be rebuilt

00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:37.010
and completely integrated and for this you have to give some time

00:40:37.010 --> 00:40:40.820
to yourself, some patience to yourself and some compassion.

00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:44.810
Not to be frustrated, disgusted with yourself.

00:40:44.810 --> 00:40:48.830
Some cases have been very difficult, I know. It’s impossible!

00:40:48.830 --> 00:40:54.707
I have to be very strict with them, I have to thrash them, do all kinds of things,

00:40:55.170 --> 00:40:58.500
but still there are cases which are to be thrashed out,

00:40:58.500 --> 00:41:02.400
doesn’t matter. We’ll work it together. Somehow, we’ll manage it.

00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:06.330
Thrashing doesn’t mean real thrashing, but thrashing with love!

00:41:06.330 --> 00:41:12.090
And all these things have worked out with so many, so why not with you?

00:41:12.090 --> 00:41:16.320
But you have to know one thing that you are seekers of ancient times

00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:21.690
and this is the time that was promised and this is the way you are going to get it.

00:41:21.690 --> 00:41:26.910
There’s no doubt about it and instead of doubting it, please have it.

00:41:26.910 --> 00:41:33.480
Take it within yourself, allow it to permeate, work it out and see for yourself

00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:38.100
that the power you have got is the power of God’s love.

00:41:38.100 --> 00:41:44.790
May God bless you. Thank you.

00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:50.790
I would like to have some questions if you have any, will be a good idea.

00:41:50.790 --> 00:41:55.980
Somebody should come here.

00:41:55.980 --> 00:41:59.490
I mean sometimes you know, I can’t hear some of their languages!

00:41:59.490 --> 00:42:01.590
I have a language problem. (laughing)

00:42:01.590 --> 00:42:05.820
Gavin can you come down here.

00:42:05.820 --> 00:42:13.200
It’s only this lifetime I have learnt English language,

00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:15.690
otherwise I never knew that before.

00:42:15.690 --> 00:42:24.870
Just anybody who wants to ask a question please ask, please. Go ahead!

00:42:24.870 --> 00:42:33.532
Not to be afraid of or frightened of anything. This is a temple you are in.

00:42:45.130 --> 00:42:47.230
No questions? It’s very good.

00:42:47.230 --> 00:42:49.030
Yes my child?

00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:03.700
You see, to begin with, you have to have your Realisation

00:43:03.700 --> 00:43:06.100
so that you get the light within yourself.

00:43:06.100 --> 00:43:08.680
But the light is not so clear-cut in the beginning, all right?

00:43:08.680 --> 00:43:12.850
Then you have to have your chakras cleared out and you have to have

00:43:12.850 --> 00:43:16.840
your Kundalini up there all the time, to feel the whole thing working out.

00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:22.060
And for that, we have certain suggestions for you, how to clear out.

00:43:22.060 --> 00:43:26.200
Because you start feeling your chakras on your fingertips to begin with.

00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:27.880
You see, you start feeling them.

00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:31.215
So, you know that supposing now this chakra is catching, for example.

00:43:31.215 --> 00:43:34.270
Seeker: Yes?

00:43:34.270 --> 00:43:36.164
Shri Mataji: Now in your case, this one is catching, all right?

00:43:36.164 --> 00:43:40.150
Why, because you have a weak eyesight.

00:43:40.150 --> 00:43:44.410
Seeker: What?

00:43:44.410 --> 00:43:50.830
Shri Mataji: Weak eyesight. If you have a weak eyesight,

00:43:50.830 --> 00:43:53.410
then the – you see here, the cerebellum becomes weak at the back.

00:43:53.410 --> 00:43:56.980
All right? Now how to get better eyesight, how to get that portion corrected?

00:43:56.980 --> 00:44:00.250
We have a particular method by which we do.

00:44:00.250 --> 00:44:03.940
You see, by light, you have to put the light here.

00:44:03.940 --> 00:44:07.960
Then the sun’s rays you have to take it in a particular way,

00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:14.320
and a little exercise is there which one has to do.

00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:16.420
And you’ll be amazed, you may have to give up your spectacles very soon.

00:44:16.420 --> 00:44:22.150
It’s like that. What I am saying, that it is pertaining to all the chakras

00:44:22.150 --> 00:44:23.170
on both the sides, means left and right.

00:44:23.170 --> 00:44:26.290
Now the left side is the emotional side and the right side is the physical

00:44:26.290 --> 00:44:29.710
and the mental side.

00:44:29.710 --> 00:44:35.620
Now whatever are our problems on the Left side and the Right side,

00:44:35.620 --> 00:44:36.895
we have different methods by which we can correct.

00:44:36.895 --> 00:44:41.292
Now if one method doesn’t work out with you, maybe another may work out.

00:44:41.470 --> 00:44:42.490
But it does work out.

00:44:42.490 --> 00:44:46.990
As it is, the upsurge of the Kundalini itself solves many problems.

00:44:46.990 --> 00:44:50.380
Upsurge of the Kundalini.

00:44:50.380 --> 00:44:55.015
So, the best thing to keep your chakras clear is to first of all,

00:44:55.015 --> 00:44:57.405
keep your heart clean, you see. You should keep your heart clean,

00:44:57.405 --> 00:45:01.950
means you should not allow bad thoughts to walk in.

00:45:01.950 --> 00:45:03.420
Now how do we do that? How to?

00:45:03.420 --> 00:45:07.620
Because if you are at the point- this one is, at thoughtless awareness point,

00:45:07.620 --> 00:45:10.860
then there is no thought.

00:45:10.860 --> 00:45:14.610
The first thing one has to do is to achieve that position

00:45:14.610 --> 00:45:18.900
when you are thoughtlessly aware, and that’s not so difficult.

00:45:18.900 --> 00:45:23.970
There are so many ways by which you just sustain that position.

00:45:23.970 --> 00:45:26.280
First of all, you jump out, absolutely you get the vibrations here,

00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:28.800
but then to put it down here is important because unless and until the Kundalini

00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:32.280
is kept here, the thoughts start coming from all the sides

00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:36.330
and then you cannot work it out so well.

00:45:36.330 --> 00:45:38.824
But it works so fast, you can’t imagine.

00:45:38.824 --> 00:45:43.170
I have known people who were alcoholics, next day they just gave up,

00:45:43.170 --> 00:45:47.070
Next day just they gave up.

00:45:47.070 --> 00:45:51.390
There are people like that: ‘druggists and chemists’ I call them,

00:45:51.390 --> 00:45:53.370
and just one day over, finished, over it.

00:45:53.370 --> 00:45:55.710
It can be like that. So you see, depends on…But doesn’t matter,

00:45:55.710 --> 00:46:00.150
not to get disgusted with yourself.

00:46:00.150 --> 00:46:03.510
You must love yourself, that’s the main point is.

00:46:03.510 --> 00:46:08.154
That if you love yourself as I love you and I’m bothered about you, it will work out.

00:46:08.154 --> 00:46:08.229
It will work out.

00:46:08.229 --> 00:46:09.167
Seeker: So love is important for us.

00:46:09.167 --> 00:46:18.171
Shri Mataji: Beg your pardon?

00:46:18.510 --> 00:46:22.350
Seeker: You have to love?

00:46:22.350 --> 00:46:25.605
Shri Mataji: You have to…?

00:46:25.605 --> 00:46:28.200
Seeker: You have to love yourself?

00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:31.860
Shri Mataji: Yes, you have to love yourself. And in love, we don’t try to harm ourselves.

00:46:31.860 --> 00:46:33.060
A mother who loves the child, she will also tell that, “Now don’t do this.

00:46:33.060 --> 00:46:39.240
This is not good!” Supposing the child is trying to put finger into some fire

00:46:39.240 --> 00:46:43.080
or something. Isn’t it? That’s what happens to you.

00:46:43.080 --> 00:46:45.960
You start guiding yourself. You just don’t do it.

00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:50.932
It just happens to you.

00:46:50.932 --> 00:46:55.740
You get that kind of a personality which does what is right, right for yourself.

00:46:55.740 --> 00:46:59.190
And it is such a mutual thing, you see?

00:46:59.190 --> 00:47:02.850
But you must have patience is what I’m trying to say there.

00:47:02.850 --> 00:47:07.920
Don’t get impatient with yourself. If you get impatient then love is decreased.

00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:10.740
Seeker: Can’t hear you.

00:47:10.740 --> 00:47:13.470
Shri Mataji: Love is decreased in you. Alright?

00:47:13.470 --> 00:47:19.620
So you have to have patience with yourself. Because it may be,

00:47:19.620 --> 00:47:24.923
there might be some chakra is not clean as yet, may be, possibly.

00:47:24.923 --> 00:47:31.660
But when we have cured people who were suffering, say from blood cancer,

00:47:31.660 --> 00:47:33.601
who are great Sahaja Yogis today. So why not you?

00:47:33.601 --> 00:47:43.300
I mean, it’s very easy.

00:47:43.300 --> 00:47:46.600
It has to be easy because it’s a living process, alright?

00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:51.940
Seeker: But what I want to know is, is it all free?

00:47:51.940 --> 00:47:54.460
Shri Mataji: Oh, it’s all free (laughter). Absolutely hundred percent.

00:47:54.460 --> 00:47:57.580
Hundred percent. Everything is absolutely free.

00:47:57.580 --> 00:48:02.530
Seeker: But I myself ????.

00:48:02.530 --> 00:48:08.050
Shri Mataji: You should! Because you can imagine, if you love yourself,

00:48:08.050 --> 00:48:14.590
how much fees are you going to pay? (laughing)

00:48:14.590 --> 00:48:18.970
See, this is that much absurd, to say to pay fees for love!

00:48:18.970 --> 00:48:24.310
You can’t imagine a person who just loves you,

00:48:24.310 --> 00:48:30.970
just loves for love’s sake. Can you think of someone?

00:48:30.970 --> 00:48:33.610
In our concept we can have someone, maybe. I think you had it in your concept

00:48:33.610 --> 00:48:37.600
otherwise I would not have been here! There is no fees.

00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:41.260
You don’t talk of fees. Alright? No question. Everything is free.

00:48:41.260 --> 00:48:46.750
All my love, everything.

00:48:46.750 --> 00:48:51.160
I don’t know. I don’t understand money. You will be amazed. I am hopelessly bad.

00:48:51.849 --> 00:48:55.329
I just don’t understand money. I am so bad that I just don’t know anything.

00:48:58.290 --> 00:49:02.520
If you ask me to cash one check in the bank,

00:49:02.520 --> 00:49:06.900
I’ll have to ask Gavin to write for me. I really don’t know.

00:49:06.900 --> 00:49:12.270
I just can’t learn about it, alright? But love I know. That I know very well.

00:49:12.270 --> 00:49:16.770
And you will also know. It’s absolutely free.

00:49:16.770 --> 00:49:20.010
So just don’t worry on that point. It has to be!

00:49:20.010 --> 00:49:22.800
This air, what do we pay for it? Nothing.

00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:26.820
Now we have of course a place where people can stay

00:49:26.820 --> 00:49:30.120
and it’s quite a nice place.

00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:31.140
And for your stay you have to pay about… they charge fifteen pounds per week,

00:49:31.140 --> 00:49:35.790
that’s all, for staying in London. Some nice place we have got.

00:49:35.790 --> 00:49:38.040
Of course that, I will not pay for your stay there!

00:49:38.040 --> 00:49:43.650
That’s what you have to pay for, if you are staying there,

00:49:43.650 --> 00:49:47.250
for your room where you stay. It’s a very nice place it’s a huge big place.

00:49:47.250 --> 00:49:47.918
For that you have to pay fifteen pounds as rent for the room.

00:49:47.918 --> 00:49:58.830
That’s a different point.

00:49:58.830 --> 00:50:06.750
But you don’t pay for my vibrations or for my knowledge or for anything.

00:50:06.750 --> 00:50:10.489
Alright? It should be made clear-cut.

00:50:10.489 --> 00:50:17.070
It doesn’t mean it’s a charity hospital where people can come and stay free,

00:50:17.070 --> 00:50:19.305
have food free. That’s not the point. For your food and for your stay

00:50:19.305 --> 00:50:25.578
you have to pay.

00:50:25.578 --> 00:50:28.690
Seeker: I understand. The course and the instruction is all free.

00:50:28.690 --> 00:50:29.903
Shri Mataji: Absolutely. Not only, but all the attention your will have, free.

00:50:29.903 --> 00:50:35.751
All the complete attention, absolutely free. Is that clear now?

00:50:35.751 --> 00:50:43.330
It’s amazing isn’t it? But it is so.

00:50:43.330 --> 00:50:46.630
Seeker: Yes, it’s amazing.

00:50:46.630 --> 00:50:48.670
Shri Mataji: Yes, it is so. Alright. What else? It’s a good question he asked.

00:50:48.670 --> 00:50:55.210
Very sweet question, you know.

00:50:55.210 --> 00:50:57.760
Seeker: Is there a danger if you awaken the Kundalini?

00:50:57.760 --> 00:51:01.982
Shri Mataji: Who says that? Can I see the gentleman?

00:51:01.982 --> 00:51:06.130
Seeker: It’s me.

00:51:06.130 --> 00:51:08.470
Shri Mataji: Ah, alright. Not at all. You have read?

00:51:08.470 --> 00:51:12.580
Seeker: Surely if it rises too fast?

00:51:12.580 --> 00:51:15.160
Shri Mataji: You see these are the people who are naive. Not only that,

00:51:15.160 --> 00:51:16.960
but they are the people who do not know a word about Kundalini.

00:51:16.960 --> 00:51:18.160
Now, here are so many people sitting here…

00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:21.490
The Kundalini is your Mother, and awakening Her, how can there be a danger?

00:51:21.490 --> 00:51:27.040
Will there be a danger if you have to sprout a seed?

00:51:27.040 --> 00:51:36.220
It’s a living process. How can there be a danger?

00:51:36.220 --> 00:51:41.170
You see these are stupid people or these are unholy people, unauthorised.

00:51:41.170 --> 00:51:42.850
They don’t know a word about Kundalini.

00:51:42.850 --> 00:51:47.710
They try to put their hands onto wrong things, do all wrong things.

00:51:47.710 --> 00:51:50.770
It can be a possession. It can be anything.

00:51:50.770 --> 00:51:58.060
They don’t know a word, they have no authority.

00:51:58.060 --> 00:52:02.020
You have to have authority.

00:52:02.020 --> 00:52:03.970
Divine authority should be there to raise the Kundalini.

00:52:03.970 --> 00:52:07.870
Like the Mother Earth, if you put a seed in the Mother earth, it will sprout.

00:52:07.870 --> 00:52:10.900
But supposing you open it and operate it and try to take out the primule, it will die.

00:52:10.900 --> 00:52:15.070
Alright?

00:52:15.070 --> 00:52:19.752
There’s no danger at all. There’s no danger of any kind.

00:52:19.752 --> 00:52:25.117
How can there be, it’s a living process.

00:52:25.117 --> 00:52:34.330
Apart from that, it is your breakthrough. It is your second birth.

00:52:34.330 --> 00:52:37.300
Even when you were born, you never felt any pain,

00:52:37.300 --> 00:52:41.080
the mother had to go through. That’s it. You don’t have to feel anything.

00:52:41.080 --> 00:52:48.160
Of course the other Sahaja Yogis might feel your chakras

00:52:48.160 --> 00:52:53.980
and might feel a little pain here and there.

00:52:53.980 --> 00:52:58.000
But it’s very little recording, to know where you have the pain.

00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:02.920
But once you become a Sahaja Yogi, when you become an expert

00:53:02.920 --> 00:53:05.740
and you start giving Realisation, then you will also know about it.

00:53:05.740 --> 00:53:07.810
There is no danger of any kind at all.

00:53:07.810 --> 00:53:11.380
Seeker: Are You saying that there’s no danger if it’s followed correctly

00:53:11.380 --> 00:53:13.915
when we awaken the Kundalini?

00:53:13.915 --> 00:53:19.990
Shri Mataji: No you have to have Divine authority to awaken it.

00:53:19.990 --> 00:53:22.660
It’s a living process as sprouting of the seed.

00:53:22.660 --> 00:53:30.400
You understand my point? So if you are ordained,

00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:36.250
not through any church or any temple or anything, but it’s a God’s ordain.

00:53:36.250 --> 00:53:40.600
Like, we can say, John the Baptist had that power when he came on this Earth.

00:53:40.600 --> 00:53:44.170
And there were many in India who had this power, who are ordained, I should say,

00:53:44.170 --> 00:53:51.010
who have a Divine Power within them flowing, who are capable of raising the Kundalini.

00:53:51.010 --> 00:53:54.790
They do it without any trouble.

00:53:54.790 --> 00:53:59.230
Even seeing them, you might get your rising.

00:53:59.230 --> 00:54:06.850
You see from my photograph, Gavin has got Realisation;

00:54:06.850 --> 00:54:11.530
he got his Realisation from my photograph, can you believe it?

00:54:11.530 --> 00:54:14.875
From my photograph only. So many got it from my photograph.

00:54:14.875 --> 00:54:18.220
So it can happen.

00:54:18.220 --> 00:54:21.276
It is a thing which is to be understood with proper patience, that God exists,

00:54:21.276 --> 00:54:24.310
and He has His own methods, His laws, and the way He works out is dynamic.

00:54:24.310 --> 00:54:25.410
Once you become that dynamic being, you will start seeing those working

00:54:25.410 --> 00:54:30.880
through your own hands. You do it.

00:54:30.880 --> 00:54:40.750
Now in New York, two-three Sahaja Yogis cured a blood cancer patient

00:54:40.750 --> 00:54:44.680
and the patient went out of the hospital. I was not there, they cured.

00:54:44.680 --> 00:54:47.650
They just cured a blood cancer. You can do that yourself.

00:54:47.650 --> 00:54:51.640
Yes, it is too fantastic isn’t it? But it is. It has been promised.

00:54:51.640 --> 00:54:54.730
You see I was reading Koran and I was amazed that many-a-times it is:

00:54:54.730 --> 00:54:56.230
“The Day of Resurrection, the knowledge will be given to you.”

00:54:56.230 --> 00:55:00.250
“The day of resurrection you will know all about this mystery.”

00:55:00.250 --> 00:55:06.730
All this was written in there and what are these Muslims doing now?

00:55:06.730 --> 00:55:10.480
And what are the Christians doing? And what are the Hindus doing?

00:55:10.480 --> 00:55:11.980
just tell me.

00:55:11.980 --> 00:55:14.740
They are fighting over, whether they should play some music

00:55:14.740 --> 00:55:18.700
before the masjid (mosque) or not, that’s all. It’s stupid.

00:55:18.700 --> 00:55:23.080
It’s all so gross that if you start thinking from that angle,

00:55:23.080 --> 00:55:28.510
I mean we really get lost, we don’t know.

00:55:28.510 --> 00:55:31.630
In the same way about Kundalini, those people who have written,

00:55:31.630 --> 00:55:33.790
I was amazed, a big book like that you see was saying,

00:55:33.790 --> 00:55:40.240
“Kundalini is in the stomach.” I said, “How can that be?”

00:55:40.240 --> 00:55:44.890
It is not! You can see with your naked eye sometimes.

00:55:44.890 --> 00:55:47.140
I will show you if somebody has a big obstruction in the Nabhi Chakra,

00:55:47.140 --> 00:55:49.930
then you see it pulsating nicely, this triangular bone,

00:55:49.930 --> 00:55:53.560
very nicely, clearly you can see.

00:55:53.560 --> 00:55:56.245
You can see the movement of the Kundalini with your naked eyes.

00:55:56.245 --> 00:56:00.040
You can see the piercing of it. Absolutely without any harm to the person.

00:56:00.040 --> 00:56:01.780
On the contrary, the one who gets Realisation never get’s any pain, that’s the worst part of it.

00:56:01.780 --> 00:56:05.350
I wish they could get a little bit to know that there is problem.

00:56:05.350 --> 00:56:08.553
Only those who are giving Realisation get it a little bit, you know?

00:56:08.553 --> 00:56:16.680
Like the mother gets the pain, in the way.

00:56:16.680 --> 00:56:20.983
But not the ones who are getting it. They don’t feel anything bad about it.

00:56:20.983 --> 00:56:24.459
Supposing a madman comes here, you see, and sits here and he hits you,

00:56:30.453 --> 00:56:33.690
he doesn’t feel anything that he’s hitting you or anything.

00:56:33.690 --> 00:56:35.790
It’s only you feel that you are hit, it is like that.

00:56:35.790 --> 00:56:42.780
Anybody comes with a problem here, we feel the little pain here

00:56:42.780 --> 00:56:45.510
and the little pain there, but they don’t feel anything

00:56:45.510 --> 00:56:48.480
and we have to work it out on them and clear out because who is the other?

00:56:48.480 --> 00:56:53.880
They are within us.

00:56:53.880 --> 00:56:58.260
To feel ourselves alright, we have to treat them.

00:56:58.260 --> 00:57:00.930
And how can we pay for that? For treating ourselves how can we pay?

00:57:00.930 --> 00:57:08.400
Do you see this point? Who is the other? They are part and parcel of you.

00:57:08.400 --> 00:57:13.320
Then you can’t take any money, you can’t grudge anything alright?

00:57:22.530 --> 00:57:24.870
We have to grow.

00:57:24.870 --> 00:57:28.830
It’s so simple as that. Can’t believe it, isn’t it?

00:57:28.830 --> 00:57:29.790
Because you have read too much about Kundalini I believe (laughing).

00:57:29.790 --> 00:57:34.320
Actually, you see, these people have no authority to write.

00:57:34.320 --> 00:57:39.420
But everybody can talk about God, about Kundalini, anything.

00:57:39.420 --> 00:57:47.493
You see that’s the trouble. Who is going to stop them?

00:57:52.840 --> 00:57:54.760
There’s no legal control over them. Anybody can say whatever they like.

00:57:54.760 --> 00:57:59.050
They say about Christ anything. I mean they write anything about anyone.

00:57:59.050 --> 00:58:02.350
I am amazed to see all this, but what to do?

00:58:02.350 --> 00:58:07.390
There’s no legal protection for God! (laughing)

00:58:07.390 --> 00:58:18.460
Any more question please?

00:58:18.460 --> 00:58:21.460
There should be no fear of any kind.

00:58:21.460 --> 00:58:23.050
The day has come for you to have Realisation.

00:58:23.050 --> 00:58:26.290
You are going to get it.

00:58:26.290 --> 00:58:29.650
Only what request I have to make, is that, even if you get Realisation today,

00:58:29.650 --> 00:58:32.650
just don’t stop it at that point, that’s all.

00:58:32.650 --> 00:58:34.720
You have to go further with it to correct yourself fully, to be the master.

00:58:34.720 --> 00:58:41.470
This is one thing you have to promise yourself.

00:58:41.470 --> 00:58:44.020
Because we’ll work very hard, and we’ll do anything that is possible,

00:58:44.020 --> 00:58:47.320
everything that is to be done, we’ll really work very hard.

00:58:47.320 --> 00:58:52.360
And it will be brought out, you will feel your Realisation.

00:58:59.460 --> 00:59:05.580
But I have to make a very humble request, that you should not very speedily stop coming

00:59:05.580 --> 00:59:09.810
and think that, “Oh, now I’ve got Realisation, finished.”

00:59:09.810 --> 00:59:16.170
No it’s not that. Alright?

00:59:16.170 --> 00:59:19.290
That’s something people feel, because sometimes they feel so elated

00:59:19.290 --> 00:59:22.020
at the first thing that they think, “Oh, now we’ve got Realisation, finished,”

00:59:22.020 --> 00:59:24.840
and then after one year they come down with some sort of a problem.

00:59:24.840 --> 00:59:26.130
That’s not good.

00:59:26.130 --> 00:59:29.457
It grows slowly. Sahaja Yoga itself has grown very slowly in this country,

00:59:29.457 --> 00:59:43.560
and has taken its roots now, gradually.

00:59:43.560 --> 00:59:50.965
And I am sure it will take its roots into the hearts of many.

00:59:50.965 --> 00:59:54.930
Because this is a special country according to my own understanding.

00:59:54.930 --> 01:00:01.421
All the knowledge, everything is free, again I say.

01:00:01.421 --> 01:00:09.810
Alright? Now should we have Realisation? Let’s have it. Alright?

01:00:09.810 --> 01:00:15.690
So, can you take out your shoes, will help you a little more.

01:00:15.690 --> 01:00:17.340
You have to little bit coordinate because this Mother Earth, you know,

01:00:17.340 --> 01:00:26.880
she helps to suck out lots of our problems.

01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:30.360
You just take out your shoes, and I hope it’s not very cold

01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:32.280
down there for you people.

01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:36.210
Just take out your shoes, that’s all, just to take out your shoes.

01:00:36.210 --> 01:00:41.280
I find some very good people today. There are some nice seekers.

01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:43.050
Better to come in front, all those who have come for the first time

01:00:43.050 --> 01:00:49.500
is a good idea. Please come forward, is a good idea to come forward.

01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:53.700
Yes. Not to have any apprehension, nothing. It’s just you become because you are ready.

01:00:53.700 --> 01:00:54.948
It’s like, as I said that an egg becomes a bird. That’s what it happens.

01:00:54.948 --> 01:01:00.000
Alright, very good.

01:01:01.100 --> 01:01:07.310
Now we have to know that, as we have shown here,

01:01:20.630 --> 01:01:27.080
there are on these tips of our fingers, first we feel the centres that are within us.

01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:34.790
And these are seven centres.

01:01:34.790 --> 01:01:39.350
This is the first centre, second, third, and then the fourth, fifth, sixth

01:01:39.350 --> 01:01:40.790
and the seventh. No I’m sorry, sixth and the seventh.

01:01:40.790 --> 01:01:44.810
These are the centres here.
