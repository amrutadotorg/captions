00:00.560 --> 00:17.210
[Last] time I talked to you about collectivity
outside your own shell, how, after your Realisation,

00:17.210 --> 00:28.949
after your second birth, you become conscious
that you are no more an egg but, now, you

00:28.949 --> 00:36.041
have become part and parcel of the whole.

00:36.041 --> 00:40.860
You realise it gradually.

00:40.860 --> 00:49.890
In the beginning only what you feel is nothing
but cool breeze blowing into your hands or

00:49.890 --> 00:55.080
maybe little tingling sometimes or maybe some
heaviness, to begin with.

00:55.080 --> 01:00.310
But then, gradually you realise it.

01:00.310 --> 01:07.710
Some people do realise it in a very quick
way.

01:07.710 --> 01:21.219
But as the infrastructure within is not properly
fixed, Realisation comes very, very slowly.

01:21.219 --> 01:28.360
I spoke to you about our infrastructure within.

01:28.360 --> 01:42.930
Now the faith in God or faith in anything
that is Divine, also in the Divine Power,

01:42.930 --> 01:48.630
is not easy to achieve logically.

01:48.630 --> 01:52.880
Some people have faith in God because they
have been taught from childhood that there

01:52.880 --> 01:54.450
is God.

01:54.450 --> 01:59.420
Maybe they think [that] by relying on something
like God, somewhere in the air, they are doing

01:59.420 --> 02:02.209
better in life.

02:02.209 --> 02:06.939
There could be many reasons why people have
faith in God.

02:06.939 --> 02:17.780
But actually, when you feel the presence of
Divine Power within you and outside, it is

02:17.780 --> 02:22.760
hard to believe that it is the Divine Power.

02:22.760 --> 02:28.840
And even if you know all about it, it is difficult
to assume it.

02:28.840 --> 02:36.610
It’s sometimes a surprise to many Sahaja
Yogis, when they see around people who have

02:36.610 --> 02:41.440
got Realisation, who have got cool breeze
flowing from their hand and they disappear.

02:41.440 --> 02:46.799
They just can’t understand such people that
– how it has happened that these people

02:46.799 --> 02:53.230
have come to a program, one day, they have
got Realisation, they have got cool breeze

02:53.230 --> 02:55.540
and then they have disappeared?

02:55.540 --> 03:02.019
Are they the people who are little-believers
or half-baked or mediocres?

03:02.019 --> 03:07.439
Or what is it that they have no curiosity
any further to go?

03:07.439 --> 03:17.590
Or that they are not intelligent enough to
understand that there’s something very dynamic,

03:17.590 --> 03:23.739
something very new, very natural [that] has
happened to them?

03:23.739 --> 03:31.349
It is not a cult, they can see for themselves,
because as in a cult there’s a mass hysteria

03:31.349 --> 03:36.720
or some abnormalities, there’s no abnormality
with these people, they are very normal.

03:36.720 --> 03:42.159
Despite all these things, all the proof to
believe that there is Divine Power around

03:42.159 --> 03:46.700
us and that now it is flowing through you,
it’s there.

03:46.700 --> 03:50.210
But still people don’t believe in it.

03:50.210 --> 03:51.629
Then why?

03:51.629 --> 03:52.629
What is the reason?

03:52.629 --> 04:06.370
We have to see what is the reason why we are
not able to still accept that this is what

04:06.370 --> 04:08.569
it is.

04:08.569 --> 04:16.070
The time when great incarnations were on this
Earth, when people like Mohammed and people

04:16.070 --> 04:22.090
like Christ, Gautam Buddha, all these people
came on this Earth – very recently I should

04:22.090 --> 04:29.430
say – nobody believed that they are incarnations
or they are Son of God.

04:29.430 --> 04:33.080
I mean this is the only problem they had – to
accept that He was Son of God.

04:33.080 --> 04:36.910
I mean this was the only problem they were
struggling [with], all of them, whether they

04:36.910 --> 04:44.150
were Jews or Muslims and such communities,
they could not accept that He was the Son

04:44.150 --> 04:45.150
of God.

04:45.150 --> 04:47.590
I mean what is the harm in accepting the situation.

04:47.590 --> 04:51.510
Supposing He is the Son of God, after all
there’s no property distribution going on,

04:51.510 --> 04:55.830
there’s nothing like a will God has written
that, “I’ll give it to my Son,” that

04:55.830 --> 04:57.270
we should contest it.

04:57.270 --> 05:00.580
But people could not accept it.

05:00.580 --> 05:11.340
Now one may say that, at that time, that nobody
felt the cool breeze, nobody felt the connection

05:11.340 --> 05:12.520
with the whole.

05:12.520 --> 05:18.370
But today also, today also the situation is
the same.

05:18.370 --> 05:28.320
Situation is the same because of a single
simple reason that: we ourselves are not integrated,

05:28.320 --> 05:34.410
we ourselves are not part of ourselves.

05:34.410 --> 05:42.419
Our mind is running one side; our body is
running another side, our heart is running

05:42.419 --> 05:49.669
in another direction, our sense organs are
running in a different direction, our liver

05:49.669 --> 05:51.750
is functioning in a different way.

05:51.750 --> 05:56.279
We are not at all integrated ourselves.

05:56.279 --> 06:03.960
And as long as this integration is not there,
even if you feel the Divine Power, even if

06:03.960 --> 06:10.360
you see the working of the Divine Power and
mentally even if you accept that, “This

06:10.360 --> 06:11.680
is what is happening to us!

06:11.680 --> 06:13.500
It is there!”

06:13.500 --> 06:20.500
And you see for yourself, even, the pulsation
of the Kundalini, the rising of the Kundalini,

06:20.500 --> 06:28.190
the breaking of the Sahastrara, even then
it is difficult to believe that Sahaja Yoga

06:28.190 --> 06:32.470
is the only way to have your rebirth.

06:32.470 --> 06:34.759
On this point some people will fizzle out.

06:34.759 --> 06:40.080
The others will fizzle out that, “Why it’s
Mother who has to do it?”

06:40.080 --> 06:46.850
Then there could be other problems also with
people that, “Why didn’t happen to other

06:46.850 --> 06:48.000
people.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.730
They had to work very hard and why didn’t
they get Realisation?”

06:51.730 --> 06:57.180
How the mind works it is something very amazing.

06:57.180 --> 07:08.030
And as I know all the permutations and combinations
of human negativity about his Realisation,

07:08.030 --> 07:14.280
I compassionately feel that it should be explained
to them why they do it.

07:14.280 --> 07:18.669
I know it’s very frustrating sometimes and
people feel so disgusted.

07:18.669 --> 07:24.200
I have seen some Sahaja Yogis thinking that,
it’s better to give up and cancel England

07:24.200 --> 07:29.550
out of the map of Sahaj Yoga, or cancel France
out of the map of Sahaj Yoga.

07:29.550 --> 07:31.680
But that’s not the way.

07:31.680 --> 07:38.729
We have to understand that their own connections
are not yet built-in.

07:38.729 --> 07:47.000
For example, this machine on which I am speaking
now, is connected to the mains.

07:47.000 --> 07:51.199
But if it is not connected within itself,
it will not work out.

07:51.199 --> 07:57.680
Both things are important, that it should
be connected outside as well as connected

07:57.680 --> 07:59.259
within.

07:59.259 --> 08:05.880
And that connection within is very, very much
lacking in the modern human beings.

08:05.880 --> 08:09.430
There are many reasons for that.

08:09.430 --> 08:16.310
First of all, a big movement started long
time back, among human beings, to deny God.

08:16.310 --> 08:19.020
To keep it, at the most, as a formal discreet
stuff.

08:19.020 --> 08:23.120
It’s just a formal thing, you see, you don’t
talk of religion at all.

08:23.120 --> 08:27.470
You go to church, come back home or you go
to a temple, come back home, sit down.

08:27.470 --> 08:32.940
You are a so-called Hindu or a Christian or
a Muslim, or something like that, but don’t

08:32.940 --> 08:33.940
discuss it.

08:33.940 --> 08:38.890
Because as soon as you start really discussing
religion in the real way…I mean it’s easy

08:38.890 --> 08:48.200
to give a sermon sitting on a pulpit, but
to allow it to be discussed and logically

08:48.200 --> 08:53.360
sorted out, it’s impossible to prove because
it is mysterious.

08:53.360 --> 09:04.279
It is a tremendous power that works it out.

09:04.279 --> 09:12.720
This tremendous power that works it out cannot
be understood by normal human being; cannot

09:12.720 --> 09:13.720
be.

09:13.720 --> 09:19.870
The working of this is so dynamic and the
dimensions into which it works out is so great,

09:19.870 --> 09:24.520
that a human mind cannot understand it, a
normal [one].

09:24.520 --> 09:33.120
Even a Sahaja Yogi, when he gets Realisation,
is trying to understand, first, the dynamism

09:33.120 --> 09:35.310
of this Divine Power.

09:35.310 --> 09:42.551
And the dynamism of this Divine Power looks
so simple, so simple, but they can’t believe

09:42.551 --> 09:45.310
it that it could be that simple!

09:45.310 --> 09:58.040
For example, if I say, sitting down here you
can find out about anyone, the way his Kundalini

09:58.040 --> 09:59.040
is.

09:59.040 --> 10:01.760
I mean this is something people can’t just
believe!

10:01.760 --> 10:03.690
It’s too much for them to believe.

10:03.690 --> 10:12.600
So, suddenly if you are exposed to something
so dynamic, so great, so vast, so effective,

10:12.600 --> 10:18.430
so efficient, it is impossible for human mind
to understand that there’s such a great

10:18.430 --> 10:21.270
thing [that] existed all through.

10:21.270 --> 10:24.459
Because they never discussed it, they never
talked about it.

10:24.459 --> 10:26.920
You are not supposed to talk about it and
discuss it.

10:26.920 --> 10:28.770
That’s the main thing.

10:28.770 --> 10:30.720
You cannot discuss religion.

10:30.720 --> 10:33.350
And how far do we discuss even science?

10:33.350 --> 10:37.300
Like they’ll say there is gravity in the
Mother Earth.

10:37.300 --> 10:38.300
Alright.

10:38.300 --> 10:40.230
What is the nature of gravity in the Mother
Earth?

10:40.230 --> 10:41.760
How is it there?

10:41.760 --> 10:43.240
Why is it there?

10:43.240 --> 10:44.240
On that point – finished!

10:44.240 --> 10:45.950
Science doesn’t give that reason.

10:45.950 --> 10:50.130
They just say, “There is a pull of gravity
in the Mother Earth.”

10:50.130 --> 10:51.130
Finished!

10:51.130 --> 10:54.450
Beyond that, they do not want to discuss,
they just say, “Alright, up to this point

10:54.450 --> 10:56.630
and beyond that nothing.”

10:56.630 --> 11:01.970
So if you go to a man who is a priest or a
religious man or one who is talking about

11:01.970 --> 11:04.350
religion [he] will say, “Oh that’s God’s
mystery.

11:04.350 --> 11:06.130
That’s God’s mystery, we cannot go.

11:06.130 --> 11:07.130
That’s a mystery.”

11:07.130 --> 11:12.180
So, one says that “You cannot go beyond
that, it is so, and that’s why we should

11:12.180 --> 11:13.870
not worry about God.”

11:13.870 --> 11:19.310
The another one says, “Alright, this is
the mystery and the mystery we cannot unravel.”

11:19.310 --> 11:30.420
So, “I’m not a believer in a thing that
exists,” or “I am the believer of a thing

11:30.420 --> 11:36.800
that exists but I cannot explain it.”

11:36.800 --> 11:43.209
If you discuss a small thing [like] – how
is it a particular flower becomes a fruit.

11:43.209 --> 11:46.339
That is not discussed, you see, in elite society,
it is not to be discussed.

11:46.339 --> 11:51.420
At the most, you can talk about weather because
there cannot be any quarrelling.

11:51.420 --> 11:55.089
Even a thing like Falkland Island should not
be discussed.

11:55.089 --> 11:59.760
Maybe some Argentinean is sitting somewhere
there, and he will be hurt about it, you see,

11:59.760 --> 12:01.290
or something might happen.

12:01.290 --> 12:04.800
So we are so careful as to what to discuss.

12:04.800 --> 12:13.050
But if people sit down and discuss it they
will know that there is a tremendous working

12:13.050 --> 12:18.740
of the Divine Power around.

12:18.740 --> 12:24.100
Can you count the amount of work it is doing?

12:24.100 --> 12:27.120
It’s an impossibility.

12:27.120 --> 12:29.180
Like a flower becoming a fruit.

12:29.180 --> 12:31.290
Now take only one type of a flower.

12:31.290 --> 12:34.570
How many there are in the whole world?

12:34.570 --> 12:38.610
I mean if you think of it you just feel that,
“It’s too much.”

12:38.610 --> 12:40.029
We just cannot.

12:40.029 --> 12:45.250
How this Mother Earth is moving with such
a tremendous speed and we are just settled

12:45.250 --> 12:47.060
down nicely here?

12:47.060 --> 12:51.610
How many such suns and stars and constellations
are moving?

12:51.610 --> 12:53.050
There’s no end to it.

12:53.050 --> 12:58.260
If you go to the microscopic side: just see
the skin and you will be surprised that it

12:58.260 --> 13:06.709
is 1/16th of an inch [and] has got such a
beautiful, organised layer which works out

13:06.709 --> 13:10.269
all the five functions of the skin.

13:10.269 --> 13:11.940
It is tremendous!

13:11.940 --> 13:18.230
And when seeing all these things, in going
into science, if man doesn’t want to realise

13:18.230 --> 13:23.940
that there must be a power that is doing all
these organised things and there must be one

13:23.940 --> 13:32.300
organised personality or maybe a controlling
thing that is working it out, then it means

13:32.300 --> 13:39.760
that they are trying to live with a myth because
they cannot solve it.

13:39.760 --> 13:42.190
The myth is that there is no God.

13:42.190 --> 13:46.600
This is the biggest myth I have ever heard.

13:46.600 --> 13:54.259
And to believe into such a thing that there
is no God is just to accept, that as you are

13:54.259 --> 14:01.520
the highest of all, the lord of all the world,
how can there be anybody higher?

14:01.520 --> 14:07.550
This is one of the biggest hurdles of human
beings in the modern times.

14:07.550 --> 14:15.550
In the ancient times, olden times, it was
so but it was not so much, to this extent

14:15.550 --> 14:21.829
that now man thinks that he is on top of the
world and that he is the one who can guide

14:21.829 --> 14:25.259
the whole world and who can manage this and
manage that.

14:25.259 --> 14:29.830
For example, I cured a patient about ten days
back.

14:29.830 --> 14:34.250
I shouldn’t say, “I cured,” because
it just happened that she got cured, through

14:34.250 --> 14:35.250
Sahaja Yoga.

14:35.250 --> 14:39.279
And she went to the hospital and the doctors
saw her.

14:39.279 --> 14:41.870
And they said, “No, it can’t be, how can
you be cured?

14:41.870 --> 14:43.100
How can you say you are cured?”

14:43.100 --> 14:44.100
She said, “I am cured.

14:44.100 --> 14:45.100
I have no pain, nothing.

14:45.100 --> 14:48.440
I am perfectly alright and everything is functioning
alright.”

14:48.440 --> 14:52.940
“But how can it be?”

14:52.940 --> 15:00.550
You see, not to accept anything comes from
a fright that, if you accept something, if

15:00.550 --> 15:10.550
you accept that there is Divine Power, then
perhaps you may have no position, no significance.

15:10.550 --> 15:16.320
So to be compassionate to people who get Realisation,
you have to tell them that, “It is not that

15:16.320 --> 15:21.279
you are overpowered by the ocean, but you
become the ocean.

15:21.279 --> 15:23.649
The drop becomes the ocean.

15:23.649 --> 15:26.540
Not that the ocean overpowers you.”

15:26.540 --> 15:35.519
Then it may be that you can go further with
the second step where ego is little bit given

15:35.519 --> 15:37.320
assurance that, “You won’t be finished.”

15:37.320 --> 15:49.639
The infrastructure has this one problem that,
ego has separated all your inner being into

15:49.639 --> 16:00.550
different parts and anything that ego says
or is pampered, is good.

16:00.550 --> 16:09.060
Good and ego’s happiness are regarded as
equal to each other.

16:09.060 --> 16:16.910
Now, if you can overcome that first hurdle
with people, that you become the ocean, that

16:16.910 --> 16:28.610
you become the guru, that you become empowered
with your own powers, you have crossed some

16:28.610 --> 16:31.769
areas in a personality.

16:31.769 --> 16:34.949
And it’s a fact.

16:34.949 --> 16:37.620
To begin with, it’s a fact.

16:37.620 --> 16:44.380
But this area, actually, you get much later
on.

16:44.380 --> 16:47.110
But better to promise that highest, you see.

16:47.110 --> 16:53.550
Like people promise that, “If you do this,
you will get the Kingdom of Heaven.”

16:53.550 --> 16:54.550
“Alright.

16:54.550 --> 16:55.550
Then what we’ll get?”

16:55.550 --> 16:58.450
“Then you will get the Kingdom of Europe.”

16:58.450 --> 16:59.450
“Then?”

16:59.450 --> 17:01.960
“Then you will get the Kingdom of England.”

17:01.960 --> 17:04.840
And like that, you see, it moves.

17:04.840 --> 17:09.460
But if you tell them that, “You will get
the Kingdom of your own Self.”

17:09.460 --> 17:12.070
They will say, “What’s there?”

17:12.070 --> 17:14.680
“The Kingdom of your Self!

17:14.680 --> 17:16.780
Such an insipid stuff?”

17:16.780 --> 17:22.920
So you have to start from the big stuff, saying
that, “You become your own guru.”

17:22.920 --> 17:25.750
Which is a fact!

17:25.750 --> 17:27.500
You do become your own guru.

17:27.500 --> 17:30.150
But that happens much later.

17:30.150 --> 17:35.850
But still if you tell them directly that,
“You become your own guru.” first, it

17:35.850 --> 17:38.750
will appeal to them.

17:38.750 --> 17:43.810
They can start thinking immediately, “Alright,
if we become the guru, we’ll start a big

17:43.810 --> 17:44.810
cult, you see?

17:44.810 --> 17:46.400
We’ll have a big cult, we’ll have so much.

17:46.400 --> 17:51.630
I’ll also have Rolls-Royces, 58 Rolls-Royces
and I can demand this and that.”

17:51.630 --> 17:56.290
All these things may start working in the
mind of a person.

17:56.290 --> 18:09.130
Because the concept of a guru is also so nonsensical
that it is not conceivable for people when

18:09.130 --> 18:11.870
you tell them, “You’ll become your own
guru.”

18:11.870 --> 18:15.010
But if you tell them, “You’ll become your
own guru,” they’ll feel happy.

18:15.010 --> 18:19.242
And that’s the point you’ve missed I think
John, the other day when you spoke, that,

18:19.242 --> 18:21.590
“You will become your own guru, that you’ll
become.”

18:21.590 --> 18:24.090
But what does that mean?

18:24.090 --> 18:32.850
Actually that means that your own religion
within you, your Ten Commandments within you

18:32.850 --> 18:38.070
will be enlightened; that you yourself will
be correcting yourself all the time.

18:38.070 --> 18:41.480
That means you will guide yourself.

18:41.480 --> 18:42.730
Nobody else has to guide you.

18:42.730 --> 18:44.180
You yourself will guide yourself.

18:44.180 --> 18:45.180
It means that.

18:45.180 --> 18:54.870
That you will have such a willpower that you
will keep to righteousness, to correct living,

18:54.870 --> 19:02.830
to normal behaviours, to the middle path of
life, to be compassionate, to be loving, to

19:02.830 --> 19:10.350
be honest and [that] all those things will
come to you automatically.

19:10.350 --> 19:13.941
That you will give up all your bad habits.

19:13.941 --> 19:18.680
“You will become your own guru,” means
that.

19:18.680 --> 19:22.860
And that is what when you tell them before,
it would be dangerous.

19:22.860 --> 19:29.320
So, I would say that, first of all, if you
have to say in a way that, “You will become

19:29.320 --> 19:35.390
your own guru,” it should not be very much
discussed and talked to people about.

19:35.390 --> 19:45.760
But [it] is a fact that, once our own Void
or our own religion within us, sustenance

19:45.760 --> 19:52.570
power, becomes enlightened, if you see the
light of that, then you enjoy that light,

19:52.570 --> 19:57.170
you enjoy your virtues, you enjoy your righteousness.

19:57.170 --> 20:01.830
And that righteousness when you start enjoying
it, you stick on to that.

20:01.830 --> 20:03.430
But that happens later on.

20:03.430 --> 20:10.070
The problem is [at] first only [what] you
feel is tingling or maybe cool breeze.

20:10.070 --> 20:17.960
But this enlightenment of your sustenance
happens later when you start enjoying your

20:17.960 --> 20:24.190
virtues, enjoying the virtues of others, enjoying
the righteousness.

20:24.190 --> 20:28.820
And that is what is a difficult thing among
human beings.

20:28.820 --> 20:39.520
And because of this delayed action people
don’t accept Sahaja Yoga.

20:39.520 --> 20:43.530
Because they want everything in a very fast
way.

20:43.530 --> 20:52.110
If they could feel the joy of enjoying the
virtues and the righteousness just then, then

20:52.110 --> 20:54.920
they would not ask any questions.

20:54.920 --> 20:59.960
But in the structure of man this comes later
on.

20:59.960 --> 21:09.160
Though you have to unravel that screw before
but it is put back the last.

21:09.160 --> 21:22.930
When the Kundalini rises in the Void it goes
through this central-most channel called as

21:22.930 --> 21:23.930
brahmanadi.

21:23.930 --> 21:32.700
Is the central-most among the three nadis,
channels, in the central channel.

21:32.700 --> 21:39.920
The central channel is Sushumna and concentrically
there are three channels placed and the inner-most

21:39.920 --> 21:40.920
is brahmanadi.

21:40.920 --> 21:46.080
The other two are called as Chitra and Charini.

21:46.080 --> 21:54.430
Now the first one, it just goes like a single
thread of hair and pierces through the fontanel

21:54.430 --> 21:57.000
bone area.

21:57.000 --> 22:01.550
Now one may say that, “Why not…”

22:01.550 --> 22:10.250
You see we can blame God for this that, “Why
not He had only one channel so that we could

22:10.250 --> 22:15.600
feel the impact of Realisation very fast?”

22:15.600 --> 22:22.410
But one has to understand that whatever God
does is for our well-being and for our hita

22:22.410 --> 22:24.980
and for our understanding.

22:24.980 --> 22:32.450
If you go the other way round you see, that
when we start hurting our central path of

22:32.450 --> 22:36.970
Sushumna we start from outside.

22:36.970 --> 22:42.410
Like, you see if you go to a wrong guru, to
a cult or to a wrong thing where you bend

22:42.410 --> 22:51.700
your head or you have faith in something that
is artificial then the first channel is broken,

22:51.700 --> 22:53.600
is hurt.

22:53.600 --> 23:02.550
Now supposing if the whole of the Sushumna
channel was made of only one tube-like channel,

23:02.550 --> 23:07.350
then the whole thing would have been finished.

23:07.350 --> 23:14.330
So, the first one, the outer-most is first
attacked by our stupidity that we do – is

23:14.330 --> 23:20.320
to bow to someone who is a fake person.

23:20.320 --> 23:25.620
Or we go to things, we believe in things who
is fake.

23:25.620 --> 23:37.850
It is also harmed in the people who are very
arrogant and think no end of themselves and

23:37.850 --> 23:41.140
they think that, “We are the lord of the
whole world.”

23:41.140 --> 23:45.530
That, “We can teach everyone, and everybody
else has just to learn from us!”

23:45.530 --> 23:53.950
That, “We are the best sect or the best
organisation or maybe the best religion or

23:53.950 --> 23:57.840
‘the chosen ones’.”

23:57.840 --> 24:07.890
Also there, first layer of the Charini is
hurt.

24:07.890 --> 24:15.760
So, at the very gross level it is first hit
by these two types of people.

24:15.760 --> 24:27.100
Now, the second one also can be hurt by people
who practice all kinds of nonsensical things.

24:27.100 --> 24:34.980
Like I have met many Sahaja Yogis who have
been to all kinds of nonsensical things and

24:34.980 --> 24:46.730
have practiced very perverted type of practices,
very perverted, and all kinds of perverted

24:46.730 --> 24:47.730
ideas.

24:47.730 --> 24:55.600
Like, they will go to a cult – I have seen
some people who have been to a cult, for example

24:55.600 --> 25:02.120
– and there it is preached that you should
not even look at your wife, or some sort of

25:02.120 --> 25:04.740
a thing, nonsense.

25:04.740 --> 25:08.760
And they are having relations with other women.

25:08.760 --> 25:14.800
Like there’s another cult in India, I don’t
know it is spreading here also perhaps, where

25:14.800 --> 25:19.580
people believe that you should never get married
and you should lead a very chaste life, you

25:19.580 --> 25:21.710
should be virgins.

25:21.710 --> 25:26.950
But the virgins have – what you call to
men virgins in English language?

25:26.950 --> 25:28.610
Oh whatever it is!

25:28.610 --> 25:31.230
I don’t know if you have any.

25:31.230 --> 25:37.820
But what you call them – men virgins, we
call them brahmacharis and brahmacharinis.

25:37.820 --> 25:42.000
So the brahmacharis, you see the men virgins
– I don’t know if you have any cult like

25:42.000 --> 25:45.670
that, but I think the priests are here like
supposed to be brahmacharis.

25:45.670 --> 25:52.450
So the brahmacharis and the brahmacharinis
should lead a life of complete celibacy and

25:52.450 --> 25:53.450
should not marry.

25:53.450 --> 25:54.820
They should not marry.

25:54.820 --> 25:56.760
Not that they should lead a life of celibacy.

25:56.760 --> 26:00.520
They should not marry.

26:00.520 --> 26:07.260
They should not marry, but there is no compulsion
as to what sort of life you should lead!

26:07.260 --> 26:11.650
Now, it is such a contrasting thing!

26:11.650 --> 26:13.720
You should not marry for what?

26:13.720 --> 26:16.470
For leading a celibate life.

26:16.470 --> 26:20.220
And then with that what is the other contrast
you have?

26:20.220 --> 26:25.330
Is that you are leading a bad life with other
people!

26:25.330 --> 26:27.410
That’s allowed.

26:27.410 --> 26:32.460
These kind of perversions when we have in
life, or all kinds of perverted things we

26:32.460 --> 26:36.580
are doing these days in modern times, all
sorts of improper things, touches the second

26:36.580 --> 26:39.590
nadi which is the Chitra.

26:39.590 --> 26:42.470
I mean, I can’t even imagine!

26:42.470 --> 26:46.330
I don’t know so many things what human beings
do, to what extent.

26:46.330 --> 26:49.240
But these are the buffer nadis outside.

26:49.240 --> 27:00.090
And that’s why there’s the very subtle
one which is called as the brahmanadi is used

27:00.090 --> 27:01.410
by Kundalini.

27:01.410 --> 27:09.500
But first, to begin with, when She rises,
She tests you and finds out what sort of an

27:09.500 --> 27:11.120
ascent She’s going to have.

27:11.120 --> 27:16.930
So, only a thread will rise first of all.

27:16.930 --> 27:23.241
Because supposing if there is a hit on say
five, six threads they are hurt and then they

27:23.241 --> 27:27.670
become very weak and they fall down.

27:27.670 --> 27:37.550
So, a very subtle, one thread we can say out
of that, comes up to pierce the fontanel bone

27:37.550 --> 27:38.550
area.

27:38.550 --> 27:42.610
Now this is the structure within us, which
does this.

27:42.610 --> 27:50.860
Is done the same way as a seed sprouts or
any living thing happens, like a flower becomes

27:50.860 --> 27:51.860
a fruit.

27:51.860 --> 27:52.860
It’s the same way.

27:52.860 --> 27:53.940
It’s a living process.

27:53.940 --> 28:04.390
So, when this one rises up and pierces the
fontanel bone area, [at] that time, when there’s

28:04.390 --> 28:09.480
a little touch with the All-pervading Power,
which is subtle, by our subtlety you start

28:09.480 --> 28:12.240
feeling this cool breeze in the hand.

28:12.240 --> 28:19.410
But still there are two more nadis surrounding
it which have to expand and get more of the

28:19.410 --> 28:23.040
Kundalini coming up.

28:23.040 --> 28:27.890
So now we cannot blame God for this kind of
doing because He knows that human beings are

28:27.890 --> 28:28.990
like this.

28:28.990 --> 28:39.720
We try all the time to ruin ourselves, morning
till evening, in every way possible.

28:39.720 --> 28:45.790
Sometimes trying to please our ego or sometimes
trying to please our superego – all our

28:45.790 --> 28:46.790
conditionings.

28:46.790 --> 28:56.270
First of all we never will accept any knowledge
from anyone which is True Knowledge and we

28:56.270 --> 29:00.020
always want to try ourselves.

29:00.020 --> 29:09.520
Now anybody who talks to us with the authority,
with that purity and with that holiness we

29:09.520 --> 29:10.520
don’t like such a person.

29:10.520 --> 29:12.340
We abhor!

29:12.340 --> 29:18.210
But anybody who plays upon our weaknesses,
upon our ego and superego, who is really harming

29:18.210 --> 29:27.310
us and we are not aware that we are harmed
by these things, we are not aware at all.

29:27.310 --> 29:34.350
Like a person like Freud now: Freud must be
a really [of] the category of Hitler.

29:34.350 --> 29:39.850
Hitler was on a very gross level but Freud
was a subtler one.

29:39.850 --> 29:42.600
He has ruined human beings, absolutely!

29:42.600 --> 29:47.050
You can see that in Kundalini, how he has
ruined the innocence of people.

29:47.050 --> 29:53.370
Their sense of shame, decency, decorum, which
is a gross thing and by putting perversions

29:53.370 --> 30:02.090
into their heads now what we have are societies
which are just like living like animals.

30:02.090 --> 30:11.840
And this is what one has to realise that the
people who talk about harming us we accept

30:11.840 --> 30:16.960
them more than those who want to construct
us.

30:16.960 --> 30:27.350
Now those who want to construct us will definitely
tell you that this is not the way it has to

30:27.350 --> 30:28.350
happen.

30:28.350 --> 30:33.230
Because if they have real concern and real
worry about you, they are not bothered about

30:33.230 --> 30:38.921
their cheap popularity, they are not bothered
about pleasing you for anything, because there

30:38.921 --> 30:47.240
is no gain as such, except for the satisfaction
that you have told the Truth to people.

30:47.240 --> 30:56.740
So this infrastructure that is within us,
the more modern we become the worse it becomes.

30:56.740 --> 31:06.590
And this infrastructure, if it gets spoiling
more, and more, and more, then it is an impossible

31:06.590 --> 31:14.610
task to communicate with them or to inform
them of the Truth.

31:14.610 --> 31:18.240
Though they might feel cool breeze in the
hand, they might get the experience and all

31:18.240 --> 31:21.350
that, but [it] doesn’t fit into their head.

31:21.350 --> 31:29.400
I have known people who have done that way
and sometimes it is amazing how thousands

31:29.400 --> 31:38.500
get Realisation and very few remain into that
state where they want to gain the deeper significance

31:38.500 --> 31:41.460
of Sahaja Yoga.

31:41.460 --> 31:46.050
Unless and until they get to the deeper significance
of Sahaja Yoga, they are not going to accept

31:46.050 --> 31:47.050
it.

31:47.050 --> 31:48.430
They are not going to recognise it.

31:48.430 --> 31:56.300
It’s a sad thing but it is so that, one
has to touch the being very deeply because

31:56.300 --> 32:02.870
it’s a beautiful being which is being ruined
by various things, as I have described to

32:02.870 --> 32:03.870
you.

32:03.870 --> 32:06.100
There’s no end to it.

32:06.100 --> 32:13.970
All these circumstances, keeping into view,
one has to be very, very careful and compassionate

32:13.970 --> 32:21.080
towards people who are seeking and who are
coming, because these are seekers of the ancient

32:21.080 --> 32:22.820
times they have been seeking.

32:22.820 --> 32:31.360
Now, as the time has passed, of course, the
communication of the Divine has improved,

32:31.360 --> 32:34.280
definitely it has improved.

32:34.280 --> 32:41.150
Because you have seen that we can give mass
Realisation, people can get mass Realisation.

32:41.150 --> 32:44.480
You have seen in India that it can happen.

32:44.480 --> 32:49.120
So the communication from the Divine Power
has improved, but the communication from the

32:49.120 --> 33:00.610
human power is reduced, reduced and also is
very much wounded.

33:00.610 --> 33:04.370
So if you see the Kundalini – I don’t
know if you can see the Kundalini of some

33:04.370 --> 33:10.340
people or most of you – you will be amazed
that it is really a wounded Kundalini.

33:10.340 --> 33:16.520
She has hit many points which has hurt Her.

33:16.520 --> 33:22.960
Because you didn’t respect, you didn’t
respect Her.

33:22.960 --> 33:30.860
You did not know how to respect Her nor you
could meet people who guided you properly

33:30.860 --> 33:38.190
how to respect that special thing that God
has given you, the special blessing of this

33:38.190 --> 33:40.450
Kundalini which is within you.

33:40.450 --> 33:52.020
Is the primule, is a very tender thing, is
so beautiful, it is eternal within you which

33:52.020 --> 33:54.330
has to rise and give you Realisation.

33:54.330 --> 34:02.260
Now this is your Mother, which is waiting
for an opportunity to give you your Realisation.

34:02.260 --> 34:09.040
And this Mother has no way to come up because
we have hurt the path through which She has

34:09.040 --> 34:12.830
to come and She is also jarred.

34:12.830 --> 34:17.409
I would say She is coiled like a tape within
ourselves.

34:17.409 --> 34:22.220
This is the structure of this Mother.

34:22.220 --> 34:27.649
She is coiled in three-and-a-half coils and
She has to rise.

34:27.649 --> 34:46.260
Now think of a tape recorder which is put
on a sea which is turbulent and sharks are

34:46.260 --> 34:54.880
eating it off and then it is burnt – all
sorts of things that can be used to damage

34:54.880 --> 34:56.140
it have been done.

34:56.140 --> 35:01.900
Still it is quite intact.

35:01.900 --> 35:04.940
Of course there are little problems with it.

35:04.940 --> 35:07.010
It is still quite powerful.

35:07.010 --> 35:15.250
It is still expecting that great happening
for which you are born, for which you are

35:15.250 --> 35:18.910
seeking, for which you are on this Earth.

35:18.910 --> 35:19.910
She’s there.

35:19.910 --> 35:27.600
You can’t think of any human mechanism of
that delicacy, that sensitivity, that beauty,

35:27.600 --> 35:32.070
that understanding and that strength.

35:32.070 --> 35:37.340
It’s hopeful against hopes.

35:37.340 --> 35:46.840
And that is the thing still preserved there,
because it is protected by your innocence

35:46.840 --> 35:50.420
which is still there, little bit left.

35:50.420 --> 35:58.010
You see whatever you may try with your innocence,
as you cannot create a complete vacuum, you

35:58.010 --> 36:01.150
cannot get rid of it the whole.

36:01.150 --> 36:09.300
So whatever part is left of your innocence
is guarding that and that essence is still

36:09.300 --> 36:11.890
waiting, is there.

36:11.890 --> 36:17.030
Whatever you might have done, whatever wrongs
you might have done makes no difference because

36:17.030 --> 36:20.500
Kundalini is intact.

36:20.500 --> 36:29.360
But what is the problem is the other way round:
that the mechanism of God is perfect.

36:29.360 --> 36:33.240
The mechanism of Divine Power to give Realisation
to thousands is absolutely in perfect state.

36:33.240 --> 36:39.120
Absolutely, I can tell you.

36:39.120 --> 36:49.740
But to make your brains understand the importance
of your Self, of your being, of your purpose,

36:49.740 --> 36:56.810
of your meaning, is difficult – because
it is not integrated.

36:56.810 --> 37:02.320
Your heart does not know your brain and whatever
happens to your heart is not communicated

37:02.320 --> 37:03.750
to your brain.

37:03.750 --> 37:10.460
If you reasonably see certain things and logically
see something happening, still your heart

37:10.460 --> 37:15.880
may refuse if it’s a weak heart, if it has
weaknesses.

37:15.880 --> 37:23.220
But the Kundalini has the beauty to strengthen
your heart, to strengthen your brain, to strengthen

37:23.220 --> 37:29.870
your liver, to strengthen all your being,
and to integrate it, but She must be given

37:29.870 --> 37:31.230
a chance.

37:31.230 --> 37:35.240
If you don’t give Her a chance, you are
not fair to yourself.

37:35.240 --> 37:41.730
People are fair to others but when are they
going to be fair to themselves?

37:41.730 --> 37:48.150
Ego is the not the way we are going to be
fair to ourself because ego is a nonsensical

37:48.150 --> 37:50.040
horse on which we are sitting.

37:50.040 --> 37:55.910
It’s like John Gilpin’s horse which takes
you round and round the places reaches you

37:55.910 --> 37:58.960
nowhere for your wedding day.

37:58.960 --> 38:01.020
It’s that kind of a nonsense.

38:01.020 --> 38:07.330
So if you are playing with John Gilpin’s
horse and if you are satisfied with it and

38:07.330 --> 38:11.460
you think it’s a big fun, we are harming
ourselves.

38:11.460 --> 38:22.500
So to get to the real point is that to understand
what is our infrastructure.

38:22.500 --> 38:24.810
The outside one is alright.

38:24.810 --> 38:28.780
We import things in India.

38:28.780 --> 38:36.270
We can import anything for India but we cannot
take it to the villages, we have no way to

38:36.270 --> 38:39.400
there, there’s no road.

38:39.400 --> 38:50.610
So that structure within us has to be built-in
with our own coordination and cooperation.

38:50.610 --> 38:54.070
We have to cooperate with it.

38:54.070 --> 39:03.680
As God has taken all the care to build in
the structure without, outside you, and also

39:03.680 --> 39:10.680
inside you He placed nice thing, and you were
the trustee of that, you were in charge of

39:10.680 --> 39:13.690
that, but it is spoilt.

39:13.690 --> 39:19.960
So you must give time for this inner structure
to come up.

39:19.960 --> 39:24.780
Now some people are unnecessarily frightened
also.

39:24.780 --> 39:30.610
I have seen some people frightened of I don’t
know what.

39:30.610 --> 39:38.830
Sometimes I think that we are frightened of
too much of purity or of holiness or they

39:38.830 --> 39:41.400
are frightened of anything.

39:41.400 --> 39:49.210
For such people I would say they should read
God’s words about it, that you should not

39:49.210 --> 39:50.260
be frightened.

39:50.260 --> 39:58.299
He is compassion, He is love and these things
are there.

39:58.299 --> 40:02.330
These are not the words of somebody who is
giving you a sermon.

40:02.330 --> 40:04.490
I am telling you the Truth.

40:04.490 --> 40:05.800
It is there.

40:05.800 --> 40:12.780
But you have to come up to that point to feel
that beauty of that Truth, to enjoy that Truth.

40:12.780 --> 40:16.830
And once you start enjoying that Truth then
there’s no problem for Me.

40:16.830 --> 40:22.970
There are some here sitting, quite a lot of
them, who have felt that way.

40:22.970 --> 40:31.280
But you have to have understanding that the
inner structure is still to be rebuilt and

40:31.280 --> 40:39.050
completely integrated and for this you have
to give some time to yourself, some patience

40:39.050 --> 40:42.080
to yourself and some compassion.

40:42.080 --> 40:46.060
Not to be frustrated, disgusted with yourself.

40:46.060 --> 40:48.760
Some cases have been very difficult, I know.

40:48.760 --> 40:49.760
It’s impossible!

40:49.760 --> 40:55.910
I have to be very strict with them, I have
to thrash them, do all kinds of things, but

40:55.910 --> 40:59.710
still there are cases which are to be thrashed
out, doesn’t matter.

40:59.710 --> 41:01.380
We’ll work it together.

41:01.380 --> 41:03.540
Somehow, we’ll manage it.

41:03.540 --> 41:07.350
Thrashing doesn’t mean real thrashing, but
thrashing with love!

41:07.350 --> 41:12.810
And all these things have worked out with
so many, so why not with you?

41:12.810 --> 41:18.730
But you have to know one thing that you are
seekers of ancient times and this is the time

41:18.730 --> 41:21.890
that was promised and this is the way you
are going to get it.

41:21.890 --> 41:27.810
There’s no doubt about it and instead of
doubting it, please have it.

41:27.810 --> 41:34.140
Take it within yourself, allow it to permeate,
work it out and see for yourself that the

41:34.140 --> 41:39.550
power you have got is the power of God’s
love.

41:39.550 --> 41:44.010
May God bless you.

41:44.010 --> 41:46.240
Thank you.

41:46.240 --> 41:52.710
I would like to have some questions if you
have any , will be a good idea.

41:52.710 --> 41:56.070
Somebody should come here.

41:56.070 --> 41:59.530
I mean sometimes you know, I can’t hear
some of their languages!

41:59.530 --> 42:02.580
I have a language problem.

42:02.580 --> 42:03.650
(laughing)

42:03.650 --> 42:10.080
Gavin can you come down here.

42:10.080 --> 42:20.010
It’s only this lifetime I have learnt English
language, otherwise I never knew that before.

42:20.010 --> 42:23.900
Just anybody who wants to ask a question please
ask, please.

42:23.900 --> 42:24.900
Go ahead!

42:24.900 --> 42:27.660
Not to be afraid of or frightened of anything.

42:27.660 --> 42:45.730
This is a temple you are in.

42:45.730 --> 42:46.960
No questions?

42:46.960 --> 42:50.230
It’s very good.

42:50.230 --> 42:53.500
Yes my child?

42:53.500 --> 42:54.590
Seeker: ??

42:54.590 --> 42:58.950
Shri Mataji: That’s true.

42:58.950 --> 43:05.880
You see, to begin with you have to have your
Realisation so that you get the light within

43:05.880 --> 43:06.880
yourself.

43:06.880 --> 43:09.400
But the light is not so clear-cut in the beginning,
alright?

43:09.400 --> 43:13.900
Then you have to have your chakras cleared
out and you have to have your Kundalini up

43:13.900 --> 43:17.720
there all the time, to feel the whole thing
working out.

43:17.720 --> 43:22.330
And for that we have certain suggestions for
you, how to clear out.

43:22.330 --> 43:26.860
Because you start feeling your chakras on
your fingertips to begin with.

43:26.860 --> 43:28.550
You see, you start feeling them.

43:28.550 --> 43:32.960
So you know that supposing now this chakra
is catching, for example.

43:32.960 --> 43:34.940
Now in your case, this one is catching, alright?

43:34.940 --> 43:36.810
Why, because you have a weak eyesight.

43:36.810 --> 43:37.810
Seeker: What?

43:37.810 --> 43:39.040
Shri Mataji: Weak eyesight.

43:39.040 --> 43:45.070
If you have a weak eyesight, then the the
cerebellum becomes weak at the back.

43:45.070 --> 43:46.070
Alright?

43:46.070 --> 43:52.280
Now how to get better eyesight, how to get
that portion corrected, we have a particular

43:52.280 --> 43:53.280
method by which we do.

43:53.280 --> 43:58.990
You see, by light, you have to put the light
here, then the sun’s rays you have to take

43:58.990 --> 44:05.170
it in a particular way, and a little exercise
is there which one has to do.

44:05.170 --> 44:09.160
And you’ll be amazed, you may have to give
up your spectacles very soon.

44:09.160 --> 44:10.640
It’s like that.

44:10.640 --> 44:15.920
What I am saying, that it is pertaining to
all the chakras on both the sides, means left

44:15.920 --> 44:16.920
and right.

44:16.920 --> 44:23.410
Now the left side is the emotional side and
the right side is the physical and the mental

44:23.410 --> 44:24.410
side.

44:24.410 --> 44:27.960
Now whatever are our problems on the Left
side and the Right side, we have different

44:27.960 --> 44:31.560
methods by which we can correct.

44:31.560 --> 44:35.740
Now if one method doesn’t work out with
you, maybe another may work out.

44:35.740 --> 44:37.180
But it does work out.

44:37.180 --> 44:40.710
As it is the upsurge of the Kundalini itself
solves many problems.

44:40.710 --> 44:42.970
Upsurge of the Kundalini.

44:42.970 --> 44:48.330
So the best thing to keep your chakras clear
is to first of all keep your heart clean,

44:48.330 --> 44:49.330
you see.

44:49.330 --> 44:55.460
You should keep your heart clean, means you
should not allow bad thoughts to walk in.

44:55.460 --> 44:57.070
Now how do we do that?

44:57.070 --> 44:58.070
How to?

44:58.070 --> 45:02.820
Because if you are at the point this one is,
at thoughtless awareness point, then there

45:02.820 --> 45:04.370
is no thought.

45:04.370 --> 45:09.150
The first thing one has to do is to achieve
that position when you are thoughtlessly aware,

45:09.150 --> 45:11.640
and that’s not so difficult.

45:11.640 --> 45:15.740
There are so many ways by which you just sustain
that position.

45:15.740 --> 45:20.540
First of all you jump out, absolutely you
get the vibrations here, but then to put it

45:20.540 --> 45:24.990
down here is important because unless and
until the Kundalini is kept here the thoughts

45:24.990 --> 45:29.090
start coming from all the sides and then you
cannot work it out so well.

45:29.090 --> 45:31.310
But it works so fast, you can’t imagine.

45:31.310 --> 45:36.750
I have known people who were alcoholics, next
day they just gave up, Next day just they

45:36.750 --> 45:38.110
gave up.

45:38.110 --> 45:45.560
There are people like that: ‘druggists and
chemists’ I call them, and just one day

45:45.560 --> 45:47.200
over, finished, over it

45:47.200 --> 45:49.360
It can be like that.

45:49.360 --> 45:53.460
So you see, depends on…But doesn’t matter,
not to get disgusted with yourself.

45:53.460 --> 45:56.590
You must love yourself, that’s the main
point is.

45:56.590 --> 46:01.630
That if you love yourself as I love you and
I’m bothered about you, it will work out.

46:01.630 --> 46:03.330
It will work out.

46:03.330 --> 46:06.300
Seeker: So love is important for us.

46:06.300 --> 46:08.420
Shri Mataji: Beg your pardon?

46:08.420 --> 46:09.720
Seeker: You have to love?

46:09.720 --> 46:12.280
Shri Mataji: You have to…?

46:12.280 --> 46:16.320
Seeker: You have to love yourself?

46:16.320 --> 46:18.700
Shri Mataji: Yes, you have to love yourself.

46:18.700 --> 46:20.730
And in love, we don’t try to harm ourselves.

46:20.730 --> 46:21.730
A mother who loves the child, she will also
tell that, “Now don’t do this.

46:21.730 --> 46:22.730
This is not good!”

46:22.730 --> 46:26.620
Supposing the child is trying to put finger
into some fire or something.

46:26.620 --> 46:27.620
Isn’t it?

46:27.620 --> 46:28.620
That’s what happens to you.

46:28.620 --> 46:30.120
You start guiding yourself.

46:30.120 --> 46:32.270
You just don’t do it.

46:32.270 --> 46:33.270
It just happens to you.

46:33.270 --> 46:41.370
You get that kind of a personality which does
what is right, right for yourself.

46:41.370 --> 46:43.780
And it is such a mutual thing, you see?

46:43.780 --> 46:46.160
But you must have patience [is] what I’m
trying to say there.

46:46.160 --> 46:48.350
Don’t get impatient with yourself.

46:48.350 --> 46:50.610
If you get impatient then love is decreased.

46:50.610 --> 46:51.610
Seeker: Can’t hear you.

46:51.610 --> 46:54.440
Shri Mataji: Love is decreased in you.

46:54.440 --> 46:56.190
Alright?

46:56.190 --> 46:57.940
So you have to have patience with yourself.

46:57.940 --> 47:03.520
Because it may be, there might be some chakra
is not clean as yet, may be, possibly.

47:03.520 --> 47:09.330
But when we have cured people who were suffering,
say from blood cancer, who are great Sahaja

47:09.330 --> 47:10.330
Yogis today.

47:10.330 --> 47:11.330
So why not you?

47:11.330 --> 47:15.030
I mean, it’s very easy.

47:15.030 --> 47:16.200
It has to be easy because it’s a living
process, alright?

47:16.200 --> 47:22.080
Seeker: But what I want to know is, is it
all free?

47:22.080 --> 47:28.220
Shri Mataji: Oh, it’s all free (laughter).

47:28.220 --> 47:30.840
Absolutely hundred percent.

47:30.840 --> 47:32.600
Hundred percent.

47:32.600 --> 47:34.990
Everything is absolutely free.

47:34.990 --> 47:37.950
Seeker: But I myself ????.

47:37.950 --> 47:40.090
Shri Mataji: You should!

47:40.090 --> 47:47.140
Because you can imagine, if you love yourself,
how much fees are you going to pay?

47:47.140 --> 47:51.940
(laughing) See, this is that much absurd,
to say to pay fees for love!

47:51.940 --> 47:56.320
You can’t imagine a person who just loves
you, just loves for love’s sake.

47:56.320 --> 47:57.960
Can you think of someone?

47:57.960 --> 48:00.160
In our concept we can have someone, maybe.

48:00.160 --> 48:06.360
I think you had it in your concept otherwise
I would not have been here!

48:06.360 --> 48:07.680
There is no fees.

48:07.680 --> 48:10.150
You don’t talk of fees.

48:10.150 --> 48:11.170
Alright?

48:11.170 --> 48:13.230
No question.

48:13.230 --> 48:16.220
Everything is free.

48:16.220 --> 48:19.290
All my love, everything.

48:19.290 --> 48:20.710
I don’t know.

48:20.710 --> 48:22.480
I don’t understand money.

48:22.480 --> 48:23.480
You will be amazed.

48:23.480 --> 48:24.730
I am hopelessly bad.

48:24.730 --> 48:27.020
I just don’t understand.

48:27.020 --> 48:31.130
I am so bad that I just don’t know anything.

48:31.130 --> 48:36.460
If you ask me to cash one check in the bank,
I’ll have to ask Gavin to write for me.

48:36.460 --> 48:37.590
I really don’t know.

48:37.590 --> 48:40.490
I just can’t learn about it, alright?

48:40.490 --> 48:41.930
But love I know.

48:41.930 --> 48:44.340
That I know very well.

48:44.340 --> 48:45.340
And you will also know.

48:45.340 --> 48:46.990
It’s absolutely free.

48:46.990 --> 48:49.910
So just don’t worry on that point.

48:49.910 --> 48:51.870
It has to be!

48:51.870 --> 48:58.040
This air, what do we pay for it?

48:58.040 --> 48:59.040
Nothing.

48:59.040 --> 49:07.340
Now we have of course a place where people
can stay and it’s quite a nice place.

49:07.340 --> 49:13.190
And for your stay you have to pay about…
they charge fifteen pounds per week, that’s

49:13.190 --> 49:15.240
all, for staying in London.

49:15.240 --> 49:17.270
Some nice place we have got.

49:17.270 --> 49:19.920
Of course that, I will not pay for your stay
there!

49:19.920 --> 49:24.370
That’s what you have to pay for, if you
are staying there, for your room where you

49:24.370 --> 49:25.370
stay.

49:25.370 --> 49:26.740
It’s a very nice place it’s a huge big
place.

49:26.740 --> 49:30.921
For that you have to pay fifteen pounds as
rent for the room.

49:30.921 --> 49:31.921
That’s a different point.

49:31.921 --> 49:36.100
But you don’t pay for my vibrations or for
my knowledge or for anything.

49:36.100 --> 49:37.100
Alright?

49:37.100 --> 49:38.100
It should be made clear-cut.

49:38.100 --> 49:43.860
It doesn’t mean it’s a charity hospital
where people can come and stay free, have

49:43.860 --> 49:44.860
food free.

49:44.860 --> 49:45.860
That’s not the point.

49:45.860 --> 49:53.880
For your food and for your stay you have to
pay.

49:53.880 --> 49:55.869
Seeker: I understand.

49:55.869 --> 49:59.200
The course and the instruction is all free.

49:59.200 --> 50:00.450
Shri Mataji: Absolutely.

50:00.450 --> 50:04.610
Not only, but all the attention your will
have, free.

50:04.610 --> 50:06.210
All the complete attention, absolutely free.

50:06.210 --> 50:07.670
Is that clear now?

50:07.670 --> 50:09.840
It’s amazing isn’t it.

50:09.840 --> 50:10.840
but it is so.

50:10.840 --> 50:11.840
Seeker: Yes, it’s amazing.

50:11.840 --> 50:13.310
Shri Mataji: Yes, it is so.

50:13.310 --> 50:14.310
Alright.

50:14.310 --> 50:15.310
What else?

50:15.310 --> 50:16.310
It’s a good question he asked.

50:16.310 --> 50:17.310
Very sweet question, you know.

50:17.310 --> 50:18.310
Seeker: Is there a danger if you awaken the
Kundalini?

50:18.310 --> 50:21.530
Shri Mataji: Who says that?

50:21.530 --> 50:26.100
Can I see the gentleman?

50:26.100 --> 50:28.850
Seeker: It’s me.

50:28.850 --> 50:32.510
Shri Mataji: Ah, alright.

50:32.510 --> 50:35.420
Not at all.

50:35.420 --> 50:36.420
You have read?

50:36.420 --> 50:37.450
Seeker: Surely if it rises too fast?

50:37.450 --> 50:42.840
Shri Mataji: You see these are the people
who are naïve.

50:42.840 --> 50:46.260
Not only that, but they are the people who
do not know a word about Kundalini.

50:46.260 --> 50:49.700
Now, here are so many people sitting here…

50:49.700 --> 50:55.369
The Kundalini is your Mother, and awakening
Her, how can there be a danger?

50:55.369 --> 50:58.580
Will there be a danger if you have to sprout
a seed?

50:58.580 --> 51:00.690
It’s a living process.

51:00.690 --> 51:01.730
How can there be a danger?

51:01.730 --> 51:06.119
You see these are stupid people or these are
unholy people, unauthorised.

51:06.119 --> 51:08.110
They don’t know a word about Kundalini.

51:08.110 --> 51:11.990
They try to put their hands onto wrong things,
do all wrong things.

51:11.990 --> 51:14.770
It can be a possession.

51:14.770 --> 51:16.520
It can be anything.

51:16.520 --> 51:17.520
They don’t know a word, they have no authority.

51:17.520 --> 51:19.010
You have to have authority.

51:19.010 --> 51:21.990
Divine authority should be there to raise
the Kundalini.

51:21.990 --> 51:27.230
Like the Mother Earth, if you put a seed in
the Mother earth, it will sprout.

51:27.230 --> 51:35.180
But supposing you open it and operate it and
try to take out the primule, it will die.

51:35.180 --> 51:36.190
Alright?

51:36.190 --> 51:38.760
There’s no danger at all.

51:38.760 --> 51:41.350
There’s no danger of any kind.

51:41.350 --> 51:43.650
How can there be, it’s a living process.

51:43.650 --> 51:46.130
Apart from that, it is your breakthrough.

51:46.130 --> 51:48.580
It is your second birth.

51:48.580 --> 51:56.360
Even when you were born, you never felt any
pain, the mother had to go through.

51:56.360 --> 51:57.360
That’s it.

51:57.360 --> 51:58.600
You don’t have to feel anything.

51:58.600 --> 52:03.880
Of course the other Sahaja Yogis might feel
your chakras and might feel a little pain

52:03.880 --> 52:04.880
here and there.

52:04.880 --> 52:08.360
But it’s very little recording, to know
where you have the pain.

52:08.360 --> 52:13.670
But once you become a Sahaja Yogi, when you
become an expert and you start giving Realisation,

52:13.670 --> 52:15.660
then you will also know about it.

52:15.660 --> 52:23.060
There is no danger of any kind at all.

52:23.060 --> 52:31.908
Seeker: Are You saying that there’s no danger
if it’s followed correctly when we awaken

52:31.908 --> 52:32.908
the Kundalini?

52:32.908 --> 52:34.540
Shri Mataji: No you have to have Divine authority
to awaken it.

52:34.540 --> 52:37.640
It’s a living process as sprouting of the
seed.

52:37.640 --> 52:39.020
You understand my point?

52:39.020 --> 52:46.900
So if you are ordained, not through any church
or any temple or anything, but it’s a God’s

52:46.900 --> 52:47.900
ordain.

52:47.900 --> 52:54.050
Like, we can say, John the Baptist had that
power when he came on this Earth.

52:54.050 --> 52:58.180
And there were many in India who had this
power, who are ordained, I should say, who

52:58.180 --> 53:03.119
have a Divine Power within them flowing, who
are capable of raising the Kundalini.

53:03.119 --> 53:06.120
They do it without any trouble.

53:06.120 --> 53:08.930
Even seeing them, you might get your rising.

53:08.930 --> 53:11.500
You see from my photograph, Gavin has got
Realisation; he got his Realisation from my

53:11.500 --> 53:14.210
photograph, can you believe it?

53:14.210 --> 53:16.100
From my photograph only.

53:16.100 --> 53:20.100
So many got it from my photograph.

53:20.100 --> 53:22.260
So it can happen.

53:22.260 --> 53:31.370
It is a thing which is to be understood with
proper patience, that God exists, and He has

53:31.370 --> 53:37.010
His own methods, His laws, and the way He
works out is dynamic.

53:37.010 --> 53:41.210
Once you become that dynamic being, you will
start seeing those working through your own

53:41.210 --> 53:42.210
hands.

53:42.210 --> 53:44.850
You do it.

53:44.850 --> 53:52.220
Now in New York, two-three Sahaja Yogis cured
a blood cancer patient and the patient went

53:52.220 --> 53:53.220
out of the hospital.

53:53.220 --> 53:55.650
I was not there, they cured.

53:55.650 --> 53:58.180
They just cured a blood cancer.

53:58.180 --> 53:59.850
You can do that yourself.

53:59.850 --> 54:03.680
Yes, it is too fantastic isn’t it?

54:03.680 --> 54:05.240
But it is.

54:05.240 --> 54:08.400
It has been promised.

54:08.400 --> 54:13.580
You see I was reading Koran and I was amazed
that many-a-times it is: “The Day of Resurrection,

54:13.580 --> 54:15.650
the knowledge will be given to you.”

54:15.650 --> 54:17.480
“The day of resurrection you will know all
about this mystery.”

54:17.480 --> 54:20.100
All this was written in there and what are
these Muslims doing now?

54:20.100 --> 54:21.840
And what are the Christians doing?

54:21.840 --> 54:27.400
And what are the Hindus doing? just tell me.

54:27.400 --> 54:33.280
They are fighting over, whether they should
play some music before the masjid (mosque)

54:33.280 --> 54:37.720
or not, that’s all.

54:37.720 --> 54:39.940
It’s stupid.

54:39.940 --> 54:48.200
It’s all so gross that if you start thinking
from that angle, I mean we really get lost,

54:48.200 --> 54:49.850
we don’t know.

54:49.850 --> 54:53.600
In the same way about Kundalini, those people
who have written, I was amazed, a big book

54:53.600 --> 54:56.000
like that you see was saying, “Kundalini
is in the stomach.”

54:56.000 --> 54:57.380
I said, “How can that be?”

54:57.380 --> 54:58.380
It is not!

54:58.380 --> 55:00.610
You can see with your naked eye sometimes.

55:00.610 --> 55:09.820
I will show you if somebody has a big obstruction
in the Nabhi Chakra, then you see it pulsating

55:09.820 --> 55:12.480
nicely, this triangular bone, very nicely,
clearly you can see.

55:12.480 --> 55:15.640
You can see the movement of the Kundalini
with your naked eyes.

55:15.640 --> 55:17.440
You can see the piercing of it.

55:17.440 --> 55:19.120
Absolutely without any harm to the person.

55:19.120 --> 55:22.630
On the contrary, the one who gets Realisation
never get’s any pain, that’s the worst

55:22.630 --> 55:23.730
part of it.

55:23.730 --> 55:28.970
I wish they could get a little bit to know
that there is problem.

55:28.970 --> 55:31.950
Only those who are giving Realisation get
it a little bit, you know?

55:31.950 --> 55:34.310
Like the mother gets the pain, in the way.

55:34.310 --> 55:38.640
But not the ones who are getting it.

55:38.640 --> 55:40.350
They don’t feel anything bad about it.

55:40.350 --> 55:45.660
Supposing a madman comes here, you see, and
sits here and he hits you, he doesn’t feel

55:45.660 --> 55:47.640
anything that he’s hitting you or anything.

55:47.640 --> 55:50.920
It’s only you feel that you are hit, it
is like that.

55:50.920 --> 55:55.470
Anybody comes with a problem here, we feel
the little pain here and the little pain there,

55:55.470 --> 55:59.740
but they don’t feel anything and we have
to work it out on them and clear out because

55:59.740 --> 56:01.440
who is the other?

56:01.440 --> 56:03.150
They are within us.

56:03.150 --> 56:05.660
To feel ourselves alright, we have to treat
them.

56:05.660 --> 56:07.090
And how can we pay for that?

56:07.090 --> 56:08.190
For treating ourselves how can we pay?

56:08.190 --> 56:09.190
Do you see this point?

56:09.190 --> 56:11.210
Who is the other?

56:11.210 --> 56:16.850
They are part and parcel of you.

56:16.850 --> 56:20.600
Then you can’t take any money, you can’t
grudge anything alright?

56:20.600 --> 56:23.040
We have to grow.

56:23.040 --> 56:28.170
It’s so simple as that.

56:28.170 --> 56:33.300
Can’t believe it, isn’t it?

56:33.300 --> 56:38.230
Because you have read too much about Kundalini
I believe (laughing).

56:38.230 --> 56:43.180
Actually, you see, these people have no authority
to write.

56:43.180 --> 56:45.300
But everybody can talk about God, about Kundalini,
anything.

56:45.300 --> 56:46.300
You see that’s the trouble.

56:46.300 --> 56:49.020
Who is going to stop them?

56:49.020 --> 56:53.000
There’s no legal control over them.

56:53.000 --> 56:54.190
Anybody can say whatever they like.

56:54.190 --> 56:56.740
They say about Christ anything.

56:56.740 --> 56:58.670
I mean they write anything about anyone.

56:58.670 --> 57:01.550
I am amazed to see all this, but what to do?

57:01.550 --> 57:09.480
There’s no legal protection for God!

57:09.480 --> 57:12.550
(laughing)

57:12.550 --> 57:18.140
Any more question please?

57:18.140 --> 57:24.280
There should be no fear of any kind.

57:24.280 --> 57:28.270
The day has come for you to have Realisation.

57:28.270 --> 57:30.150
You are going to get it.

57:30.150 --> 57:37.680
Only what request I have to make, is that,
even if you get Realisation today, just don’t

57:37.680 --> 57:41.380
stop it at that point, that’s all.

57:41.380 --> 57:49.590
You have to go further with it to correct
yourself fully, to be the master.

57:49.590 --> 57:55.900
This is one thing you have to promise yourself.

57:55.900 --> 58:00.590
Because we’ll work very hard, and we’ll
do anything that is possible, everything that

58:00.590 --> 58:03.730
is to be done, we’ll really work very hard.

58:03.730 --> 58:07.570
And it will be brought out, you will feel
your Realisation.

58:07.570 --> 58:18.730
But I have to make [a] very humble request,
that you should not very speedily stop coming

58:18.730 --> 58:21.250
and think that, “Oh, now I’ve got Realisation,
finished.”

58:21.250 --> 58:22.390
No it’s not that.

58:22.390 --> 58:23.390
Alright?

58:23.390 --> 58:28.119
That’s something people feel, because sometimes
they feel so elated at the first thing that

58:28.119 --> 58:30.740
they think, “Oh, now we’ve got Realisation,
finished,” and then after one year they

58:30.740 --> 58:33.369
come down with some sort of a problem.

58:33.369 --> 58:36.070
That’s not good.

58:36.070 --> 58:37.070
It grows slowly.

58:37.070 --> 58:42.869
Sahaja Yoga itself has grown very slowly in
this country, and has taken its roots now,

58:42.869 --> 58:43.869
gradually.

58:43.869 --> 58:47.520
And I am sure it will take its roots into
the hearts of many.

58:47.520 --> 59:00.110
Because this is a special country according
to my own understanding.

59:00.110 --> 59:04.090
All the knowledge, everything is free, again
I say.

59:04.090 --> 59:05.090
Alright?

59:05.090 --> 59:07.570
Now should we have Realisation?

59:07.570 --> 59:09.850
Let’s have it.

59:09.850 --> 59:10.850
Alright?

59:10.850 --> 59:16.570
So, can you take you your shoes, will help
you a little more.

59:16.570 --> 59:19.960
You have to little bit coordinate because
this Mother Earth, you know, she helps to

59:19.960 --> 59:21.240
suck out lots of our problems.

59:21.240 --> 59:26.750
You just take out your shoes, and I hope it’s
not very cold down there for you people.

59:26.750 --> 59:33.510
Just take out your shoes, that’s all, just
to take out your shoes.

59:33.510 --> 59:37.150
I find some very good people today.

59:37.150 --> 59:39.740
There are some nice seekers.

59:39.740 --> 59:46.390
Better to come in front, all those who have
come for the first time is a good idea.

59:46.390 --> 59:51.780
Please come forward, is a good idea to come
forward.

59:51.780 --> 59:52.780
Yes.

59:52.780 --> 59:53.780
Not to have any apprehension, nothing.

59:53.780 --> 59:55.730
It’s just you become because you are ready.

59:55.730 --> 01:00:00.150
It’s like, as I said that an egg becomes
a bird.

01:00:00.150 --> 01:00:03.550
That’s what it happens.

01:00:03.550 --> 01:00:06.100
Alright, very good.

01:00:06.100 --> 01:00:13.130
Now we have to know that, as we have shown
here, there are on these tips of our fingers,

01:00:13.130 --> 01:00:16.530
first we feel the centres that are within
us.

01:00:16.530 --> 01:00:17.530
And these are seven centres.

01:00:17.530 --> 01:00:23.960
This is the first centre, second, third, and
then the fourth, fifth, sixth and the seventh.

01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:29.730
No I’m sorry, sixth and the seventh.

01:00:29.730 --> 01:00:32.520
These are the centres here.

01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:37.020
Now these centres are seven, and these centres
are seven.

01:00:37.020 --> 01:00:41.359
These join together to form the central path,
like this.

01:00:41.359 --> 01:00:43.990
So the Left side and the Right side.

01:00:43.990 --> 01:00:50.760
And to feel- I mean medically also they accept
that the sympathetic nervous system is expressed

01:00:50.760 --> 01:00:55.020
on the fingertips, that’s all, they have
reached to that point and they accept that.

01:00:55.020 --> 01:01:06.510
So when you put your hands towards me like
this, just like this…

01:01:06.510 --> 01:01:11.390
And close your eyes…

01:01:11.390 --> 01:01:16.260
Just close your eyes.

01:01:16.260 --> 01:01:26.960
Keep your eyes shut, for one reason that,
when the Kundalini rises above Agya Chakra,

01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:36.680
that is where my red mark is, then the pupils
get dilated so, if your eyes are not closed

01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:39.210
then the Kundalini doesn’t rise above that.

01:01:39.210 --> 01:01:52.680
So better keep the eyes shut for the Kundalinis
to rise above that centre, just.
