00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:16.320
As I told you that, I have

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:22.560
the war between Alexander and Poros
was finished because of a sister's intervention.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:28.360
And also how Shri Krishna whose sister was Draupadi,

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:35.040
Vishnumaya was born as Draupadi
and how He came to save Her chastity

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.880
by rushing all the way from Dwarika.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:52.640
So, you can see that when we
ascend in the collective consciousness

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.760
and we have collective living, collective meeting

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:08.160
at the Vishuddhi Chakra, Shri
Krishna establish this, or He manifested

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.800
this pure relationship of a sister.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.040
In a collective life that we have,

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:30.400
in the Ashram where we live, where
we move about as Sahaja Yogis,

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:42.000
if we do not have this basic principle within
us, there will be a chaos, complete chaos.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:48.120
Once this purity of relationship is established:

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:54.840
that apart from my wife, all the
rest are my sisters or mothers,

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:12.400
it cannot be a proper society

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:26.200
And the chaos of the social system of America is
because they have no sense of pure relationships.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:34.920
Once you call somebody a sister, she's a sister.
And once you call somebody a brother, he's a brother.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.760
It's not only that you should be born
of the same parents, it's not necessary,

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:55.320
but this is a very important principle to have a
very pure society where everybody can live peacefully.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:04.720
It's a common thing I have seen in the West, that
a lady comes as a friend of the wife of the house.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:12.320
So, she's there and she is a
sister of the husband, has to be.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:27.880
But on the contrary, next day you find that this
man starts having bad eyes towards this lady,

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:40.720
because, from very childhood, if you have not
fixed your attention on your sister, with all that purity,

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:50.560
you cannot have that pure feelings for another woman.

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.320
The starting point is your own sister.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:03.560
The son is born and then the daughter is born
or first the daughter is born and the son is born.

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:15.400
From that small age, when they are innocent, this
is a dimension of sisterly pure relationship is developed,

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:22.240
even when the society is so corrupt and bad.

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.680
But at a very young age, say, at the age of eighteen years,

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:32.280
because of the social relations here and the social ideas,

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:41.920
the second part, which is a
brother's duty towards the sister,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:50.960
is to respect the chastity of his sister and to protect it,

00:04:52.440 --> 00:05:04.840
and also it is the sister's duty to
keep the brother moral, morally all right.

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:13.200
So once it becomes freedom after the
eighteen years of time, eighteen years of age,

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:20.400
then the sister goes with any man, lives with
any man, the boy is not supposed to say anything,

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:29.440
or if the brother goes and stays with anyone, the
sister cannot say anything, she cannot interfere.

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:36.080
On the contrary, like India anywhere
or I was told also in China and Egypt,

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:45.840
even Islamic countries, if they find
their sister going with another man,

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:49.760
they'll shoot that man in the Islamic countries.

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:56.720
In India they may not shoot, but
they will see that the sister is put right.

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:02.960
Same with the brother, in India I can say, in China also.

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:08.440
If the brother is immoral, he's
going the wrong way, then the sister

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:15.880
tries her level best to bring him back to normal morality.

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:22.120
It's very common that if a man is doing
wrong, then the wife goes to the sister

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:29.800
and she's very anxious, and she becomes very upset about it.

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:34.000
She goes all out to correct her brother.

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:44.280
And this innate understanding exists within us.

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:52.040
In every person, whether you are born in America or
anywhere, that if the brother is doing the wrong thing,

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:55.200
if he is smoking, if he is doing wrong things,

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:59.440
more than the mother, the sister feels it,

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:04.680
more than the mother, the sister
wants that it should be corrected,

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:10.120
and she goes all out, to fight it out.

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:19.160
Mother may start crying, weeping, give up,
but the sister will go on fighting her brother.

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:24.960
In her, all efforts, she will see to
it that the brother comes around.

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:34.200
Also, other things like, if the brother is
doing something illegal, something wrong,

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:38.560
something which is detrimental to the society,

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:46.960
it is the sister, who has a right,
divine right, to go and correct.

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:54.480
In a society, where this relationship is very
pure and where societies are quite settled down,

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:58.960
the question doesn't arise,
mostly, that the sisters do wrong.

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:05.800
But supposing a sister does something
wrong, supposing a sister goes out of the family,

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:11.320
she tries to give up her family for somebody else,

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:21.680
or she tries to dominate her husband
or to do something wrong in the family,

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:36.600
then the brother will go and tell her off,
what he thinks of her, and will try to correct her.

00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:41.760
So this right to correct between
brother and sister does exist,

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:51.240
not because it is some sort of an outward
thing but innately from within ourselves.

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:55.920
This is the Ganesha Principle
which acts, on Vishuddhi Chakra

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:02.400
where, whatever communications
we have, we have a sister's relationship

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:04.880
and a mother's relationship.

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:08.120
Krishna also had a Foster Mother, as you know,

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:15.960
and the relationship with Him was exactly like Her Own Son.

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:24.000
So, if you call somebody as a mother, it
has to be absolutely pure relationships.

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:31.520
So there are three types of relationships
with a woman, is one, is that of a mother,

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:40.200
another of a sister or a daughter, and another is of a wife.

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:44.088
Daughter cannot correct the father.

00:09:44.168 --> 00:09:48.080
Daughter has no right to correct the
father and she will not correct the father.

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:53.920
On the contrary, even if he does wrong,
she'll support him. She'll stand by him. Always.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:00.160
She will even go against the mother
to support father. It's nature. It's natural.

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:06.640
But the son will correct the father, if he
is doing something against the mother.

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:15.200
It's a natural thing. It's a male
force supporting the female's force

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:20.240
or the female force correcting the male force

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:26.240
in such a manner that the society is
kept clean and there is proper growth.
