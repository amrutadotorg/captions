WEBVTT

00:21.431 --> 00:24.833
Now, as you know that United States
or America,

00:25.034 --> 00:29.675
the whole of it, is the Vishuddhi chakra.

00:29.876 --> 00:37.345
Out of which, we have three sides
to the Vishuddhi chakra.

00:38.635 --> 00:45.138
So, the central part of the Vishuddhi
chakra is United States.

00:45.339 --> 00:51.724
The central part of the Vishuddhi chakra
is governed by Shri Krishna.

00:51.925 --> 00:55.498
And His power is Radha.

00:55.699 --> 01:02.530
“RA – DHA”. “RA” means energy, “DHA” is
the one who has sustained the energy.

01:02.731 --> 01:06.111
“RA – DHA”. “dha-re-ti-saa”.

01:06.312 --> 01:11.144
So, she’s the one who has sustained
the energy,

01:11.374 --> 01:16.814
and so, she’s called as Radha. She’s
the power of Shri Krishna.

01:17.015 --> 01:21.899
The word Krishna comes from the word –
Krishi, means –

01:22.100 --> 01:27.914
the ploughing, or you can say, agriculture
is called as “Krishi”.

01:28.115 --> 01:36.303
The one who ploughs and puts the seed
in the soil, is doing the krishi.

01:36.504 --> 01:40.396
And, that’s why he’s called as Krishna.

01:40.920 --> 01:51.104
Now, the seed that he has sown, is the seed
of spirituality.

01:51.305 --> 01:54.887
It is Shri Krishna who said, in Sanskrit –

01:55.088 --> 01:59.224
“Nainam chindanti shastrani
nainam dahati pavakah

01:59.425 --> 02:04.801
na chainam kledayanty apo
na shoshayati marutah”

02:05.002 --> 02:08.941
meaning – it cannot be, means,
the spiritual life

02:09.142 --> 02:13.513
or you can say, the eternal life, or
the Spirit,

02:13.714 --> 02:18.766
cannot be killed by anything, by any
weapon,

02:18.967 --> 02:22.150
neither can be blown away by air,

02:22.351 --> 02:27.432
nor can it be sucked in, nor can it be
destroyed.

02:27.633 --> 02:30.643
So, to prove that, Christ came on this
earth,

02:30.844 --> 02:36.595
and through His resurrection he proved,
what Shri Krishna has said.

02:36.871 --> 02:39.661
And most of you sahaj yogis know
the relationship

02:39.862 --> 02:43.032
of Christ and Shri Krishna – why he was
called Christ.

02:43.233 --> 02:47.150
Christ word comes from the same – Krishna.

02:47.351 --> 02:52.356
And, his first name comes from the word
Yashoda.

02:52.557 --> 02:55.495
Yashoda is also called as Jesu or Yesu.

02:55.696 --> 03:05.053
And that’s why (Krish) Christ was called
as Je-su or Ye-su.

03:05.254 --> 03:08.169
Some people call him Yesu, and some people
call him as Jesu,

03:08.370 --> 03:13.579
because of Yashoda (the mother), the foster
mother of Shri Krishna.

03:14.387 --> 03:18.358
Also, you know that Radha was the same
as Mahalakshmi,

03:18.559 --> 03:26.214
so she was the same as the mother
of Christ, Mary.

03:26.415 --> 03:29.438
These, all these things we can prove it
in Sahaj Yoga.

03:29.639 --> 03:34.751
Because, when the Kundalini moves up
to the Vishuddhi chakra,

03:34.952 --> 03:38.169
and if it stops there, you can ask
the question –

03:38.370 --> 03:42.983
Was Jesus the son of mother Mary?

03:43.184 --> 03:50.524
Who was the son of Ra, was the same
as Radha?”

03:50.725 --> 03:52.490
And then the Kundalini moves.

03:52.691 --> 03:58.123
So, Sahaja Yoga today is the thing which
proves what has been said so far.

03:58.324 --> 04:02.433
It proves. It’s not just a cock and bull
story.

04:02.633 --> 04:05.504
Because people do not believe into all
these things.

04:05.705 --> 04:08.148
They think that it’s all cock and bull
story. Who was Christ?

04:08.349 --> 04:11.741
Who was Krishna? Who was Radha? After all,
there was no God.

04:11.942 --> 04:18.478
But only in Sahaja Yoga, today, we can
prove it, that what we say is the truth.

04:18.679 --> 04:24.010
Because, as through realisation, you get
connected to the mains,

04:24.211 --> 04:28.423
your vibrations start flowing,

04:28.624 --> 04:31.521
like the computer, you start working.

04:31.722 --> 04:34.151
And whatever question you ask,

04:34.352 --> 04:37.054
answer comes to you as tremendous
vibrations,

04:37.255 --> 04:40.936
or it stops or you might get heat or you
may get blisters.

04:41.137 --> 04:47.755
So, the whole message is communicated
to you through your fingertips.

04:47.956 --> 04:54.443
(...) Now Vishuddhi chakra was created
on the Saturday.

04:54.644 --> 05:00.291
So, it is the Saturn – that’s the important
star of the Vishuddhi chakra.

05:00.492 --> 05:03.089
So, whenever the Saturn is at the highest,

05:03.290 --> 05:06.623
America will be in a better place to do
things.

05:06.824 --> 05:13.289
But I don’t think they know much about
themselves.

05:13.490 --> 05:16.199
They don’t know what they are, why they
are on this earth,

05:16.400 --> 05:19.040
what is their work, what they are supposed
to do,

05:19.241 --> 05:24.190
or what is the purpose of God of creating
America.

05:24.391 --> 05:30.270
The first job of the Vishuddhi chakra
within us was that,

05:30.500 --> 05:34.994
when we became human beings, we raised
our heads up like that.

05:35.195 --> 05:37.903
When you raised your head up like that,

05:38.104 --> 05:42.247
you have become a human being, in the sense
that now,

05:42.448 --> 05:45.417
there is a new movement in your
consciousness.

05:45.618 --> 05:51.867
Now the new movement in your consciousness
started about 6000 years back

05:52.068 --> 05:55.016
when Shri Krishna came on this earth.

05:55.217 --> 05:59.147
That the new movement was, that it is
the Father.

05:59.348 --> 06:04.314
The advent of the Father was celebrated,
and that’s how

06:04.515 --> 06:12.488
people developed a kind of a new instrument
within themselves, called ego.

06:12.689 --> 06:15.777
When the brain was lifted like this
you see,

06:15.978 --> 06:21.790
it expanded in a pyramidical – it’s
a pyramid – it became a pyramid.

06:21.991 --> 06:26.295
In an animal, the brain is flat. And,
gradually it rises.

06:26.496 --> 06:29.359
When the head was raised, when
the responsibility was taken

06:29.559 --> 06:32.468
of raising the head, the brain started
growing

06:32.669 --> 06:37.980
in such a way that it became a pyramid.
And when it became a pyramid,

06:38.181 --> 06:43.414
he attention became a different attention
from that of animal.

06:43.622 --> 06:47.938
Because, when the waves of your
consciousness

06:48.139 --> 06:54.490
fell on the sides of the pyramid, they went
into the parallelogram of forces,

06:54.691 --> 07:00.370
by which the resultant force –
the resultant force…

07:00.571 --> 07:05.593
Now, it falls like this, goes like that,
the resultant force is like that –

07:05.794 --> 07:10.334
had two sides – one was this, another
was this.

07:10.535 --> 07:13.512
So, the consciousness, or we can say,
the attention –

07:13.713 --> 07:17.985
instead of going inside, started going
outward.

07:18.186 --> 07:21.147
So, one part of the resultant was going
outside

07:21.348 --> 07:26.746
and that’s how, when you became a human
being, your attention went outside.

07:26.947 --> 07:31.508
Are the human beings only, who have their
attention outside.

07:31.709 --> 07:33.574
Not that the animals don’t have,

07:33.775 --> 07:40.207
but the attention of human beings are such
that they create reactions.

07:40.408 --> 07:44.124
Like, you see something.

07:44.325 --> 07:47.532
Now, I see Doctor’s house say for example,

07:47.733 --> 07:52.433
then a reaction starts in my mind – what is
this, what does this mean,

07:52.634 --> 07:56.367
how much it must have cost, from where
did he buy it!

07:56.568 --> 07:59.386
Anything you see, it starts giving you
a reaction.

07:59.587 --> 08:02.476
Not to the animals. Animals, at the most
they will say –

08:02.677 --> 08:06.568
this I must eat, that I must eat, that
I must get.

08:06.769 --> 08:09.650
But, they do not think about it.

08:09.851 --> 08:12.781
It’s only the human beings who reflect.

08:12.982 --> 08:20.273
And this reflection comes because of the
pyramid-like structure of the brain.

08:20.474 --> 08:25.939
And this has a special reaction in
the brain itself,

08:26.187 --> 08:30.188
that we start developing our own ego,

08:30.389 --> 08:33.946
our own myths, our own mental projections.

08:34.147 --> 08:37.394
And when we develop our own mental
projections,

08:37.595 --> 08:40.985
this ego starts developing, “I know”
“what’s wrong”,

08:41.186 --> 08:43.226
all these nonsensical things come.

08:43.427 --> 08:48.072
And once that starts working out,
the balloon of the ego starts rising.

08:48.273 --> 08:51.687
It starts pushing the other balloon which
was within us,

08:51.887 --> 08:53.889
is of the superego – as an animal.

08:54.090 --> 08:56.547
And then, comes up in the centre.

08:56.748 --> 09:01.206
That’s how we now become normal human
beings.

09:01.407 --> 09:05.417
But then we start increasing our ego.

09:05.618 --> 09:10.669
It starts overlapping the superego,

09:10.870 --> 09:17.087
and a calcification takes place, by which
we develop our I-ness.

09:17.288 --> 09:23.613
So, it is all the happening that takes
place after we have lifted our head,

09:23.814 --> 09:28.210
raised our head, and we are no more
like animals.

09:28.411 --> 09:32.764
So, Vishuddhi chakra has a very big part
to play

09:32.965 --> 09:38.147
in the human evolution, that by developing
your Vishuddhi chakra,

09:38.348 --> 09:43.138
you have become human beings, first of all.

09:43.339 --> 09:49.217
Secondly, because it is the chakra
of the Father,

09:49.418 --> 09:57.719
who becomes again, the primordial – as you
call it in…,

10:03.282 --> 10:07.036
macrocosm. You become the macrocosm.

10:07.237 --> 10:13.227
You are the microcosm, and the Father
is the macrocosm.

10:13.428 --> 10:17.564
So, you become that because of
the Vishuddhi chakra,

10:17.765 --> 10:19.987
which is governed by Shri Krishna,

10:20.188 --> 10:24.262
who becomes that macrocosm, called
as Virat.

10:24.463 --> 10:30.586
In the brain it is expressed in this part.
In this part of the head.

10:30.787 --> 10:35.386
It is here that you start manifesting

10:35.587 --> 10:41.580
your macrocosm qualities – at this point.

10:41.781 --> 10:44.919
Now, this Vishuddhi chakra has
a speciality – is that,

10:45.120 --> 10:48.507
we always say that the responsibility
on my shoulders.

10:48.708 --> 10:52.242
Always we say that – the responsibilities
are on my shoulders.

10:52.443 --> 10:58.424
The reason is, the Vishuddhi chakra gives
you the sense of responsibility.

10:58.625 --> 11:03.053
And that’s why you know, the Americans
feel responsible for the whole world.

11:03.254 --> 11:05.862
Naturally!

11:06.713 --> 11:11.486
It’s perfectly understood, that they feel
responsible for the whole world.

11:11.687 --> 11:18.869
But how much they are aware of their role

11:19.070 --> 11:22.640
as the responsible people, that’s
a different point.

11:22.841 --> 11:24.770
But they feel they are responsible,

11:24.971 --> 11:30.426
but their role, as responsible people,
if they understand,

11:30.627 --> 11:34.956
then they have to be ideals. Ideals.

11:35.157 --> 11:38.817
Because a person who is a responsible
person in a family,

11:39.018 --> 11:41.597
has to be the ideal for others.

11:41.798 --> 11:43.710
It started very well, I should say,

11:43.911 --> 11:47.301
at the time of Abraham Lincoln. It started
very well.

11:47.502 --> 11:50.456
When you started talking about democracy,
is also –

11:50.657 --> 11:53.538
democracy is nothing but collectivity.

11:53.739 --> 11:58.902
He started talking about collectivity
of the people, by the people.

11:59.103 --> 12:01.827
All that shows that the sense
of collectivity

12:02.028 --> 12:06.271
started coming right in this Vishuddhi
chakra.

12:06.514 --> 12:09.841
(...) Specially for America, I’m wearing
this stone

12:10.042 --> 12:12.376
which is called as the black sapphire.

12:12.584 --> 12:17.451
Because, this is the stone of Shri Krishna.
It’s the stone of Vishuddhi chakra.

12:17.652 --> 12:20.042
Every chakra has a stone.

12:20.243 --> 12:22.137
And this is the stone of the Vishuddhi
chakra,

12:22.338 --> 12:26.388
so I’m wearing this, just for coming
to America.

12:26.589 --> 12:39.694
And, I hope that today’s worship will bring
out the potential of this country

12:39.895 --> 12:46.984
by exciting the deities, Shri Krishna
himself, who is in charge.

12:47.185 --> 12:52.820
By pleasing him. By making him active.
