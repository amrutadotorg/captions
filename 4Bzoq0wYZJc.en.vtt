00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:32.190
Would you like a drink, Shri Mataji?

00:00:34.425 --> 00:00:35.420
Diet Coke.

00:00:48.627 --> 00:00:55.062
So we are with the nature here. So beautiful!

00:01:06.508 --> 00:01:12.272
The way it is planned you can see how the person who has planned it had the feel of the land,

00:01:12.272 --> 00:01:14.552
feel of the nature.

00:01:14.552 --> 00:01:20.862
How he has made up, by not destroying it.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.144
Whatever is there he used it,

00:01:25.152 --> 00:01:28.822
otherwise they would have put one
bulldozer and finished it off.

00:01:31.432 --> 00:01:37.822
The way it is planned shows he had
feeling for the land and he could understand.

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:44.073
The way we look at nature also, is our own.

00:01:44.096 --> 00:01:46.596
The way we are inside, that’s how we look at nature.

00:01:47.846 --> 00:01:51.785
Nature is our friend absolutely;
it's working for us all the time.

00:01:52.694 --> 00:01:55.194
And we don’t do much for it.

00:01:57.272 --> 00:02:01.792
Look at these trees.

00:02:01.782 --> 00:02:05.902
They give shade, they give fruits.

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:09.045
Whatever is possible for them, they do it.

00:02:10.954 --> 00:02:15.575
And when they are old, we use them for wood.

00:02:17.345 --> 00:02:19.845
All supportive to our life.

00:02:21.513 --> 00:02:29.732
But we must have feeling; otherwise, what’s happening today is this ecological problem.

00:02:37.423 --> 00:02:44.933
And this is because we do not have
any feeling for the Mother Earth.

00:02:44.947 --> 00:02:47.447
No feeling for the nature.

00:02:48.499 --> 00:02:54.749
We are really plundering her
and then the whole thing reacts.

00:03:00.647 --> 00:03:09.784
It's a kind of an aggression that

00:03:09.805 --> 00:03:13.634
you want to have so many
things at the same time.

00:03:15.717 --> 00:03:20.482
Like I have seen once, first
when we went to England,

00:03:20.498 --> 00:03:31.126
we never served any drinks in our house in India, but in England nobody would come to your house, so we had to organise.

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.126
I told C.P. that “You better
do something about it.”

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:41.633
So he went and bought some
books, how to organise.

00:03:41.633 --> 00:03:46.542
So first the question of tumblers.

00:03:46.542 --> 00:03:50.963
And so many types of tumblers you had to use.

00:03:50.975 --> 00:03:57.415
I mean in those days, this was I’m telling
you, 1973, or say beginning of ’74.

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:08.044
The first lot we had to get cost us
nine thousand pounds. First total.

00:04:08.044 --> 00:04:13.391
But we had to get about twenty-four of
the best crystal, the best crystal.

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:24.576
Because for everything there's a different
type of a crystal that you have to have.

00:04:25.406 --> 00:04:30.216
I just thought that if you had some
silver, it would be much better.

00:04:30.214 --> 00:04:37.890
One glass of silver is sufficient, once for all your lifetime, your children’s lifetime.

00:04:37.896 --> 00:04:41.147
Instead of that, all these things like crystal.

00:04:41.146 --> 00:04:47.546
But at least it was crystal, it was all right
because it was in a way, some sort of an art.

00:04:50.494 --> 00:04:59.093
And then I learnt how they make, even in England, etching and all that. Beautiful in Scotland!

00:04:59.114 --> 00:05:03.663
English crystal also is nice.
The best is Czechoslovakian.

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:12.467
All these things I learnt there with
that horrible sets of tumblers

00:05:13.905 --> 00:05:20.192
and you had to have the best quality,

00:05:20.214 --> 00:05:27.052
that’s something, part of the prestige, you see.

00:05:27.073 --> 00:05:32.382
So somebody will come and just
see the glass,

00:05:35.672 --> 00:05:37.623
slowly, you see.

00:05:37.616 --> 00:05:42.854
And the plates also, they’ll
come and just turn round.

00:05:42.876 --> 00:05:45.404
First I didn’t know what was happening.

00:05:45.423 --> 00:05:48.654
Because that’s not done in India,
I mean nobody’s bothered, you see.

00:05:48.664 --> 00:05:53.064
Only if there’s art they will appreciate, finished.

00:05:53.074 --> 00:05:58.452
We don’t have Saville Rows and all
that in India, so it's different.

00:05:58.447 --> 00:06:07.922
And that’s what I felt, that so many
tumblers are needed for one household.

00:06:09.295 --> 00:06:16.806
So, they are spending so much
money to buy all these varieties.

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:24.936
But the worst is in America and
now they’re suffering from it.

00:06:24.955 --> 00:06:27.455
Even in plastic they have varieties.

00:06:29.547 --> 00:06:32.926
So you go to somebody’s house, so they…

00:06:55.372 --> 00:07:06.153
So even in plastic they would, say, they have plastic tumblers which are just usable once.

00:07:06.153 --> 00:07:10.433
So they use once that, then it’s thrown out.

00:07:10.451 --> 00:07:15.503
Even in the drawing room, in a, say, restaurant or anything,

00:07:15.524 --> 00:07:17.656
even in their own drawing
rooms they have plastics.

00:07:17.671 --> 00:07:19.529
Can you imagine?

00:07:20.979 --> 00:07:24.909
And then they will use a lot
of paper, plastic things.

00:07:24.909 --> 00:07:27.409
They never have proper plates.

00:07:28.619 --> 00:07:31.537
They may be very rich but they
are always on the picnic,

00:07:31.557 --> 00:07:38.897
you see, eating with the paper
plates, using plastic things.

00:07:38.897 --> 00:07:42.007
But they are so proud of it.

00:07:42.017 --> 00:07:47.197
You see, this is a new on that has come now in the plastic scene.

00:07:49.357 --> 00:07:52.902
But what is so great about
this? It's after all plastic.

00:07:52.922 --> 00:07:56.392
It's new, you see, new.  New is the idea.

00:07:58.456 --> 00:08:02.934
Then everything has to be different. Every year.

00:08:02.957 --> 00:08:05.457
So this is the fashion this
year, so this kind of clothes

00:08:26.642 --> 00:08:32.732
Now they go on discarding this plastic
that they use, then dresses also.

00:08:32.732 --> 00:08:36.032
This is the fashion in Paris,
so that’s the dress comes in.

00:08:37.002 --> 00:08:41.702
Then the entrepreneurs have really
made us slaves out of that.

00:08:41.707 --> 00:08:49.982
Now, if you are dressed differently they say,
“Oh, you are out of fashions, out of date.”

00:08:49.982 --> 00:08:52.957
So one lady came to see Me.

00:08:52.978 --> 00:09:03.238
She had pants cut here, here, jeans
you see cut here, there, everywhere.

00:09:03.248 --> 00:09:07.656
I was just worried that if
she sits on, may give way.

00:09:07.656 --> 00:09:09.976
The way it was cut.

00:09:09.986 --> 00:09:16.536
And a funny type of a shirt with all cuttings
everywhere, all the threads coming out.

00:09:17.644 --> 00:09:21.444
So I said, "Why are you dressed up like this?"

00:09:21.452 --> 00:09:23.952
"I'm up to date."

00:09:33.752 --> 00:09:39.226
So I asked her, "What about
Me?" "You're antique!"

00:09:40.887 --> 00:09:45.297
I said, "Antique is more
precious that up- to-date."

00:09:50.101 --> 00:09:56.984
So in India, we say that these people
have got now the desire to be beggars.

00:09:57.015 --> 00:09:58.654
With everything beggarish!

00:09:58.654 --> 00:10:05.435
The houses are beggarish, dresses are
beggarish, the hair are beggarish.

00:10:05.414 --> 00:10:07.914
To add up to it, drugs have come,

00:10:07.914 --> 00:10:17.421
so it’s all absolutely… you feel you are
in some sort of a fish market, smelling.

00:10:17.428 --> 00:10:22.091
The way people live is… I mean, they
are no way better than our slumming,

00:10:23.391 --> 00:10:26.721
the way they live, the way
they eat, the way they like.

00:10:26.704 --> 00:10:30.224
They have money, not that
they don’t have money.

00:10:30.238 --> 00:10:33.934
Well they probably pay lots of money
for the clothes with the cuts in.

00:10:33.934 --> 00:10:38.603
Oh, they pay more for that. They pay more.

00:10:38.607 --> 00:10:44.683
But you go to any house you
see, England is worse this way,

00:10:45.473 --> 00:10:51.456
and when I was searching for a house,
we had to go from places to places.

00:10:51.476 --> 00:10:53.976
Quite big houses we were looking out for.

00:10:55.382 --> 00:11:01.426
Suddenly, you find two legs of
pants falling on you from somewhere,

00:11:01.426 --> 00:11:03.726
and then some shirts
coming on your faces.

00:11:03.726 --> 00:11:05.786
I said, "What's this?"

00:11:05.796 --> 00:11:09.004
"Oh, these are old clothes we have, you see."

00:11:09.896 --> 00:11:10.854
"Since long?"

00:11:10.854 --> 00:11:13.354
"Oh no! This was last year's."

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:15.512
"Why are you keeping them?"

00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:18.032
"What to do?"

00:11:20.912 --> 00:11:24.822
"You better throw them away. It's
no good, give it away to someone."

00:11:26.996 --> 00:11:29.956
"No, we are keeping them. Maybe
the fashion might come back."

00:11:29.956 --> 00:11:33.486
Piles and piles and piles.

00:11:33.486 --> 00:11:39.853
You get into a room and suddenly
you are on a pile of dirty clothes.

00:11:39.862 --> 00:11:42.362
So untidy! So horribly lousy!

00:11:44.669 --> 00:11:47.642
This is advancement.

00:11:47.635 --> 00:11:50.135
This is what we have progressed.

00:11:50.441 --> 00:11:55.707
So this funny greed of having
more and more and more and more,

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:59.007
I mean, you can have, but
have something artistic

00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:02.344
so you won’t have too many
things, you’ll have few.

00:12:02.344 --> 00:12:06.550
If you try to have artistic things,
then you will have some few things.

00:12:06.548 --> 00:12:09.048
But if you want to buy
plastic, there’s no end to it.

00:12:15.368 --> 00:12:22.413
The clothes are all artificial these days
and in that the fashions are changing.

00:12:22.414 --> 00:12:27.584
So we should not be slave of these entrepreneurs
who are just befooling us all the time.

00:12:27.591 --> 00:12:30.091
In the market something comes up funny,

00:12:30.091 --> 00:12:34.413
transparent clothes, you see, made of plastic.

00:12:35.973 --> 00:12:40.673
Something absurd, you know sometimes
the clothes are very absurd.

00:12:40.673 --> 00:12:44.173
Like they had very tight
jeans once upon a time.

00:12:44.174 --> 00:12:48.775
And they tighten it by … they said
that you wear it and get into the tub.

00:12:48.775 --> 00:12:51.525
And when you come out they
just stick to your body.

00:12:51.535 --> 00:12:54.035
And then you bathe with it all the time.

00:12:54.035 --> 00:12:57.745
I don’t know if they bathe
also, that’s another point.

00:12:57.745 --> 00:13:02.115
Now, it’s such a funny
thing that with this,

00:13:02.119 --> 00:13:06.003
the ladies couldn’t get into the buses
so they were to be pushed in you see.

00:13:12.871 --> 00:13:16.861
But the worst was that they
developed varicose veins.

00:13:19.752 --> 00:13:23.270
So they would come to Me.
I said, “Why did you wear?”

00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:26.940
So that was the fashion. Then
they started with the baggy ones,

00:13:26.970 --> 00:13:29.350
with the holes, holy pants.

00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:36.798
Like that, you see, moving from one to
another, having too many things of no value.

00:13:36.798 --> 00:13:42.614
So the Sahaja yogis should understand
that we are friends of the nature.

00:13:42.619 --> 00:13:47.170
And whatever nature gives
us, we have to respect it.

00:13:47.196 --> 00:13:49.696
Better wear natural clothes as far as possible.

00:13:52.957 --> 00:13:59.865
One natural shirt is better
than three unnatural ones,

00:13:59.865 --> 00:14:05.139
because you can breathe better, your skin
breathes better, you can wash it better.

00:14:05.159 --> 00:14:07.926
So best is to take to more natural things.

00:14:07.926 --> 00:14:13.211
I think this trend is coming up,
and that’s a very good trend,

00:14:13.211 --> 00:14:16.456
that we should take to natural things.

00:14:16.456 --> 00:14:23.131
And when we take to natural things, there’s
one thing we cannot have too many of it.

00:14:23.147 --> 00:14:30.127
But if you start using something
plastic, then there can be any number

00:14:30.149 --> 00:14:34.653
and that's how you really
torture the Mother Earth.

00:14:34.653 --> 00:14:37.153
First of all, you dig her out.

00:14:37.153 --> 00:14:40.521
Then you wear all these things.

00:14:40.586 --> 00:14:43.558
And they cannot be destroyed.

00:14:43.572 --> 00:14:46.072
There are mountains and mountains!

00:14:46.072 --> 00:14:50.251
Mountains and mountains of this
plastic if you go in America.

00:14:50.243 --> 00:14:55.158
Even in England I’ve seen
mountains, such a filthy sight.

00:14:55.150 --> 00:15:00.278
They can’t burn it. If you
put it in the sea, it floats.

00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:09.682
And wherever you go near all these so - called very big cities,

00:15:09.687 --> 00:15:18.779
if you see the sea from the aeroplane
you find all littered up completely.

00:15:18.786 --> 00:15:27.278
So we are spoiling our beaches, we are
spoiling our homes and wasting our money.

00:15:29.578 --> 00:15:33.930
So these entrepreneurs have
no feelings for the nature.

00:15:35.246 --> 00:15:38.596
They never think what nature is like.

00:15:42.517 --> 00:15:45.146
When I wanted to build this Pratishthan,

00:15:45.145 --> 00:15:50.938
the five six architects from
India (they’re Sahaja yogis also)

00:15:50.947 --> 00:15:54.918
very well qualified but in
the Western manner, you know.

00:15:56.616 --> 00:16:07.811
So the design they made was some sort of a colonial style house with a platform all along

00:16:07.811 --> 00:16:10.871
because the land was like this, you see.

00:16:10.884 --> 00:16:15.811
So they took the zero point as the highest.

00:16:15.792 --> 00:16:21.212
So you hang on a platform, for which
you have to pay enormous amount.

00:16:21.212 --> 00:16:28.162
I said, " All the way we have not come
to this place to hang in the air.

00:16:28.178 --> 00:16:30.506
They couldn't understand
what I was talking to them.

00:16:30.508 --> 00:16:33.008
I said, "I want to stick to the ground

00:16:33.008 --> 00:16:35.508
I'll build the house on the ground."

00:16:36.698 --> 00:16:41.237
They said, "You have to make a topography,
you have to make this 'graphy,' that 'graphy.'

00:16:41.242 --> 00:16:46.167
"This is very simple. What is this
'graphies' you are making? Just get to it.

00:16:48.471 --> 00:16:52.048
Luckily, they had gone all of them
on leave for about fifteen days.

00:16:52.048 --> 00:16:54.548
I changed the whole lot.

00:16:55.687 --> 00:16:59.331
And we would have been
hanging on twenty-two feet high.

00:17:00.377 --> 00:17:08.468
So I put one hall underneath that.

00:17:08.481 --> 00:17:14.108
And when you are moving down, you never
feel that you are going down that low.

00:17:15.348 --> 00:17:21.421
And it’s the personality of the nature
which is expressed in that house.

00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:23.920
It’s very interesting.

00:17:23.935 --> 00:17:26.601
You have seen Pratishthan?

00:17:26.615 --> 00:17:29.115
You see, did you feel that
you are going too much down?

00:17:29.115 --> 00:17:30.878
Nobody feels that way.

00:17:30.898 --> 00:17:33.398
You don't actually feel
you are going down at all.

00:17:35.185 --> 00:17:37.118
Well it is.

00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:40.984
but after fifteen days they returned.

00:17:40.983 --> 00:17:42.443
All go!

00:17:42.463 --> 00:17:43.513
"What?"

00:17:43.533 --> 00:17:44.864
"How?"

00:17:44.864 --> 00:17:49.394
It's going to happen." I said, "Nothing
going to happen, take it from Me."

00:17:49.378 --> 00:17:55.152
I’ve used it the best way one has to use and
nothing is going to happen to your building

00:17:55.176 --> 00:17:56.402
And they were after the builder.

00:17:56.402 --> 00:18:00.142
The builder said, "Shri Mataji
praised me, so I'm not bothered."

00:18:02.182 --> 00:18:05.824
And it all worked out so well. So well!

00:18:05.822 --> 00:18:11.374
So this is what it is in the...
it's also labour saving, you see.

00:18:11.374 --> 00:18:15.242
If you ask somebody, “Why
do you wear plastic?”

00:18:15.255 --> 00:18:19.534
they say, “You don’t have to press it.”

00:18:19.535 --> 00:18:22.035
But what’s the harm in pressing?

00:18:22.875 --> 00:18:28.894
You see there’s one cloth if you have to press it’s all right, it’s a good idea, or don’t press.

00:18:28.894 --> 00:18:33.826
Don’t want to press, don’t press,
you’ll look quite neat, doesn’t matter.

00:18:33.823 --> 00:18:41.423
But what is the need, I don’t
understand, to have so many plastics?

00:18:41.422 --> 00:18:46.009
So Sahaja yogis should avoid
plastic things as far as possible,

00:18:45.995 --> 00:18:53.102
especially for children, one should be
careful not to make them wear plastics.

00:18:58.739 --> 00:19:01.000
All of them are here, isn't it?

00:19:01.009 --> 00:19:03.509
A gathering of the clans Mother!

00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:05.162
They must be going home.

00:19:05.153 --> 00:19:10.372
Either they are having a birthday
party... or must be doing a training exercise.

00:19:10.386 --> 00:19:12.886
Or celebrating some rescue work.

00:19:15.847 --> 00:19:18.826
Why! Look at that (unclear)

00:19:26.724 --> 00:19:32.864
What about plastic toys for the
children? Is that a bad thing?

00:19:35.384 --> 00:19:37.976
Not very good for them.

00:19:37.984 --> 00:19:44.126
Also these plastic napkins you
use for children are not necessary

00:19:44.119 --> 00:19:49.616
Then you see, you become unattentive
to children also with that.

00:19:52.621 --> 00:19:58.217
I mean, toys they play for a while but still
sometimes they put it in the mouth and…

00:20:05.077 --> 00:20:13.063
If you see, children are more fond of things
made out of cloth or made out of wood.

00:20:13.059 --> 00:20:16.683
They like it. They like the feel of it.

00:20:16.678 --> 00:20:26.348
You put five plastic things and one thing made out of wood or made out of cloth, they’ll pick up the cloth one.

00:20:26.348 --> 00:20:28.848
They like the feel of the
smoothness of it, you see.

00:20:30.894 --> 00:20:37.225
They’re very expensive here, I agree,
but in India they’re very cheap.

00:20:37.225 --> 00:20:40.345
This time in Madras I don’t know
if you picked up something or not,

00:20:40.345 --> 00:20:44.035
lots of things were there for sale for children.

00:20:46.115 --> 00:20:51.755
You see, they wouldn’t stop My car anywhere, I was on the run, otherwise I would have bought.

00:20:51.754 --> 00:20:58.059
The wooden toys for girls are very good in India. Beautiful!

00:20:58.069 --> 00:21:00.569
Also for boys!

00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:06.787
But the plastic toys which are
covered with cloth are all right.

00:21:06.801 --> 00:21:09.301
Not so dangerous!

00:21:15.902 --> 00:21:19.894
Plastic is something that
penetrates into everything.

00:21:19.903 --> 00:21:22.403
Into everything!

00:21:24.663 --> 00:21:27.163
We also give too many toys to our children.

00:21:29.113 --> 00:21:34.223
In our days, a girl would have
only one doll or two dolls now.

00:21:35.152 --> 00:21:38.494
But now the plastic toys,

00:21:38.494 --> 00:21:45.034
the whole room is filled with it, I mean you have to just wade through to find out your child in all this.

00:21:45.015 --> 00:21:46.655
So many toys!

00:21:46.675 --> 00:21:52.145
Perhaps maybe we avoid having
relationship with our children.

00:21:54.285 --> 00:22:00.003
We don’t talk to them, we have no time, so give them some toys, stop them, there.

00:22:00.852 --> 00:22:03.732
Sort of a diversion.

00:22:03.732 --> 00:22:06.672
And that’s how we don’t
know our children at all.

00:22:07.832 --> 00:22:09.002
Too many toys.

00:22:09.001 --> 00:22:14.021
And the toys also now are coming out

00:22:14.032 --> 00:22:18.731
in such a way that’s another slavery because
on the television they’ll advertise it.

00:22:18.751 --> 00:22:21.991
Your children will be after
you, "I want that toy."

00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:31.350
There was a bear, they took it
out, which had a birth date.

00:22:31.348 --> 00:22:44.537
And so they would celebrate the birthday and all the bears were invited you see, for that.

00:22:44.537 --> 00:22:52.223
It’s so funny, isn’t it, that
children should be given such ideas?

00:22:52.223 --> 00:22:59.506
Because there’s no rapport. If the parents have a rapport with children, children won’t need so much.

00:22:59.522 --> 00:23:06.213
You must read some proper stories to
be told to children, talk to them.

00:23:06.221 --> 00:23:11.588
If you keep company with them, I don’t
think they’ll ask for toys, too many toys.

00:23:11.588 --> 00:23:13.148
They would not.

00:23:13.158 --> 00:23:16.628
They’ll be very satisfied, because
most of them are realised souls.

00:23:16.645 --> 00:23:25.242
So talk to them in such a manner that they develop their spirituality rather than all these materialistic things.

00:23:28.513 --> 00:23:33.292
I have found that we don’t spend
much time with our children.

00:23:33.302 --> 00:23:35.492
That’s why they are like this.

00:23:35.502 --> 00:23:41.552
We had such a problem. I was telling you about these wise children we had in our school there.

00:23:41.547 --> 00:23:44.840
The teachers were mad. They
didn’t know what to do.

00:23:44.838 --> 00:23:47.338
They said, "Within one month's
time, we will give up."

00:23:47.338 --> 00:23:50.730
They said, "We can't do this any more."

00:23:52.229 --> 00:24:04.122
The relationship between the child and parents
should be very sensible and of respect.

00:24:04.121 --> 00:24:12.791
Because I have seen that children go on asking questions, “Why? Why?” like that.

00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:15.300
You see, it’s kind of an
aggressive nature, that’s all.

00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:19.480
They don’t want to know anything.
Just go on asking questions.

00:24:19.483 --> 00:24:25.779
At that time you have to tell them, “You are not to know this. There’s no need for you to know.”

00:24:25.774 --> 00:24:28.274
You have to shut them.

00:24:28.274 --> 00:24:34.259
The quieter child is much
better, who observes, who learns.

00:24:34.257 --> 00:24:40.496
But the one who is aggressive becomes
later on a very wild personality.

00:24:40.512 --> 00:24:43.556
So to see that your child is not aggressive.

00:24:43.583 --> 00:24:47.823
They are exhausting. These
children are absolutely exhausting.

00:24:47.846 --> 00:24:51.026
This time I went to Rome.

00:24:53.977 --> 00:24:58.876
And I bought some sweets for them.

00:24:58.876 --> 00:25:01.736
Some chocolates.

00:25:01.756 --> 00:25:10.546
So when I sat down I said, "Now these
children, some lollipops and chocolates."

00:25:11.836 --> 00:25:14.680
So they all rushed on to Me,

00:25:14.676 --> 00:25:18.090
pushing their hands like this.

00:25:18.083 --> 00:25:21.453
I said, "This is not to be done, you
are not beggars. Are you beggars?"

00:25:21.453 --> 00:25:23.553
Then they sat back.

00:25:23.553 --> 00:25:25.363
They are not beggars.

00:25:25.353 --> 00:25:29.452
But say in India you try this, no
child will push forward this way.

00:25:29.446 --> 00:25:33.192
If you try to give he’ll feel
shy, he’ll look at the mother.

00:25:33.210 --> 00:25:43.102
Should he take it or not? But this comes only
because of the rapport we have with children.

00:25:43.098 --> 00:25:45.932
Now how do we have rapport with them?

00:25:48.098 --> 00:25:55.886
See now, you take them to the nature
here and see them, how they behave,

00:25:55.886 --> 00:25:58.916
what is their style,

00:25:58.936 --> 00:26:02.117
what is their treatment?

00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:06.877
Instead of making them
run about like mad

00:26:06.891 --> 00:26:12.337
or taking out some flowers or doing
some sort of an aggressive act,

00:26:12.357 --> 00:26:15.477
just make them sit down. Tell
them, “Now what is this flower?

00:26:15.491 --> 00:26:17.991
Do you know the name of this flower?

00:26:17.991 --> 00:26:20.999
Now this one, do you know what that flower is?"

00:26:21.029 --> 00:26:26.769
I mean many parents don't know themselves.
I don't know if they can explain.

00:26:26.776 --> 00:26:28.959
Then, "What is this tree?"

00:26:28.959 --> 00:26:30.861
Look at the nature.

00:26:30.866 --> 00:26:34.881
Put the attention of the
children on to something

00:26:34.876 --> 00:26:41.331
which will make them more
contented and more deeper.

00:26:41.316 --> 00:26:45.449
Instead of that, as soon as they see
the space they just start running.

00:26:45.473 --> 00:26:47.599
You don’t know what to do with them.

00:26:47.613 --> 00:26:53.459
It is because you have not taught them how to be concentrated on something very interesting.

00:26:53.459 --> 00:26:57.406
Now see, I am sitting here. I am
sitting watching these stones.

00:26:57.425 --> 00:26:59.306
Even this will be in My head.

00:26:59.315 --> 00:27:03.286
See what a beautiful fibre,
just see, just see. Beautiful!

00:27:03.283 --> 00:27:04.626
This is nature.

00:27:04.626 --> 00:27:10.846
And if once children start appreciating
it, their attention will be more on this

00:27:10.873 --> 00:27:13.373
than on something
nonsensical, you see.

00:27:27.817 --> 00:27:34.585
So a rapport needs to be established
and an understanding of the children.

00:27:34.607 --> 00:27:37.107
An appreciation. When they do something good,

00:27:37.107 --> 00:27:38.795
you must appreciate.

00:27:38.795 --> 00:27:43.365
And when they are doing something, mostly they
do wrong things just to attract your attention.

00:27:43.365 --> 00:27:50.475
If you don’t pay any attention to that and just distract their attention, to something else, it’s very easy.

00:27:50.475 --> 00:27:57.035
For example, now if you are going to somebody’s
house, the children are going with us;

00:27:57.032 --> 00:28:01.552
before going we tell them, “See now,
you have to behave there properly,

00:28:01.552 --> 00:28:05.302
otherwise they’ll think that
your parents are no good.

00:28:05.312 --> 00:28:11.578
Now we go there. You should not,
in no way try to misbehave.

00:28:11.578 --> 00:28:14.431
Shouldn't ask for anything. Just keep quiet."

00:28:14.428 --> 00:28:17.991
So first of all, you tell them how to behave.

00:28:17.991 --> 00:28:22.905
Now when they go there and they behave properly
when you come back, you have to tell them,

00:28:22.905 --> 00:28:27.475
“This is tremendous. You have been so good.

00:28:27.492 --> 00:28:30.325
You behaved so well, it's really very good.

00:28:30.325 --> 00:28:34.395
I'm so proud of you. So next time even better.

00:28:37.598 --> 00:28:42.838
Then you have to tell them about
their dignity,

00:28:42.842 --> 00:28:46.408
about what they are.

00:28:46.423 --> 00:28:49.278
And also the dignity of the nature.

00:28:49.283 --> 00:28:52.402
“See how dignified the tree is.

00:28:52.412 --> 00:28:55.492
How it is standing there for giving a shade.”

00:28:55.502 --> 00:28:57.882
So they develop that feeling within them.

00:28:57.882 --> 00:29:06.524
If you do not have feeling for the nature, you cannot stop these ecological problems.

00:29:06.524 --> 00:29:09.024
That's important, very important.

00:29:11.784 --> 00:29:17.401
Luckily, with Sahaja Yoga,
Hamid has done some research

00:29:17.396 --> 00:29:23.565
and he has worked on the trees near Austria.

00:29:23.588 --> 00:29:34.924
There’s a very beautiful mountainous area, much higher than this, between Germany and Austria.

00:29:34.923 --> 00:29:39.503
There used to be some sort
of wasps, were really fatal.

00:29:39.516 --> 00:29:50.046
Now they have all disappeared and the trees are crumbling down with this acid rain and getting completely destroyed.

00:29:50.061 --> 00:29:52.561
So the government asked him to
do some experiment with them.

00:29:54.181 --> 00:30:02.934
So, he took My vibrated water in a puja and he mixed it with other water, put it everywhere.

00:30:02.949 --> 00:30:11.342
So he said, “All the trees about
sixty years of age didn’t react much.

00:30:11.342 --> 00:30:21.201
But below that, they all reacted
and they started looking healthier.”

00:30:21.213 --> 00:30:23.713
But he said still, the speed was not there.

00:30:23.713 --> 00:30:30.286
So there were lots of these badges from America left over

00:30:30.306 --> 00:30:34.196
So he went and pushed them into every tree.

00:30:34.196 --> 00:30:38.896
And he said, “I went there after six
months and the whole thing was changed,

00:30:38.906 --> 00:30:42.740
vibrated and it's all so green, so beautiful.

00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:49.570
It’s a remarkable thing to happen.

00:30:49.570 --> 00:30:56.975
So I think My picture must be giving
balance or something to this acid rain,

00:30:56.975 --> 00:30:59.390
or it nourishes these trees.

00:30:59.390 --> 00:31:04.525
The vibrations after all, vibrations do nourish everything,

00:31:04.511 --> 00:31:08.535
and I don’t know what happened to the acid rain.

00:31:08.546 --> 00:31:11.046
It’s very different.

00:31:12.536 --> 00:31:20.175
We can try that everywhere,
vibrated water and these badges.

00:31:20.188 --> 00:31:23.673
Even the rings have done great works.

00:31:23.673 --> 00:31:29.017
He had a problem because they don’t
have well as we have in India.

00:31:29.042 --> 00:31:31.208
They only have those taps.

00:31:31.202 --> 00:31:42.421
So he removed the joining ring and put his
ring inside that, and then he joined it.

00:31:42.424 --> 00:31:49.265
With that ring only, it worked
wonders, can you imagine?

00:31:50.769 --> 00:31:53.269
Ah, just imagine.

00:31:54.889 --> 00:31:57.389
Maybe the ring was emitting.... (break in recording)

00:31:58.901 --> 00:32:08.961
...what is our status and what is our position.

00:32:08.970 --> 00:32:11.470
We are something very different from others.

00:32:11.481 --> 00:32:13.981
We have so much capacities.

00:32:15.576 --> 00:32:26.960
So we must understand what we can do to
really improve the conditions around us,

00:32:26.967 --> 00:32:29.467
our children, everything,

00:32:29.467 --> 00:32:33.726
because now you have that
vital force which you can use.

00:32:35.281 --> 00:32:40.815
But many Sahaja yogis are such, they do not understand

00:32:40.835 --> 00:32:48.547
that Sahaja Yoga is not for only for your personal cleanliness or for your personal ascent,

00:32:48.547 --> 00:32:56.107
but for the ascent of the whole
universe, of the whole people.

00:32:56.117 --> 00:32:59.471
Anywhere there’s a Sahaja yogi you can make it out.

00:32:59.467 --> 00:33:10.226
Once I was going in a village and I saw a
beautiful, very beautiful field of corn.

00:33:10.236 --> 00:33:15.786
Such beautiful corn, such thick, thick seeds in it.

00:33:16.916 --> 00:33:19.506
He said, "Whose field?"

00:33:19.516 --> 00:33:22.466
I asked the Sahaja yogi, I said, "Whose field is this?"

00:33:22.486 --> 00:33:24.986
He said, "This is mine."

00:33:26.636 --> 00:33:28.040
"What did you do?"

00:33:28.046 --> 00:33:34.778
"I just got one coconut vibrated by You and put it my well."

00:33:38.759 --> 00:33:41.436
All these miracles are happening.

00:33:41.456 --> 00:33:47.516
Something, when I was building Pratishthan
you see, we didn’t have water or well there.

00:33:47.517 --> 00:33:50.426
So the neighbour said, “My well
is lying here, you can use it,

00:33:50.421 --> 00:33:53.868
but it only can work for a few days.

00:33:53.877 --> 00:33:57.478
You'll have to arrange for water to build the house.

00:33:57.497 --> 00:34:00.268
I said, “All right.”

00:34:00.264 --> 00:34:05.848
So the first thing Sahaja yogis did was
to put My vibrated water in that well

00:34:05.838 --> 00:34:08.888
and one coconut.

00:34:08.908 --> 00:34:13.378
Suddenly that well started getting filled up.

00:34:15.390 --> 00:34:19.768
And while building, you see there’s a big ball kept there,

00:34:19.791 --> 00:34:21.318
to suck the water up.

00:34:21.331 --> 00:34:23.831
The ball was hanging in the air,
but still the water was coming.

00:34:25.496 --> 00:34:29.990
And the whole of Pratishthan was built with that water.

00:34:30.001 --> 00:34:36.144
We never had to buy any water and
everybody was amazed. How can it be?

00:34:36.154 --> 00:34:43.844
But the water from, I don’t know from
where that source, but just sucked it.

00:34:43.876 --> 00:34:47.988
Till we finished the house,
there was water in that well.

00:34:48.018 --> 00:34:54.219
Then the fellow said, “I want this
well for my own use."  He'll use it for himself.

00:34:54.232 --> 00:34:56.732
Immediately it dried up.

00:34:56.732 --> 00:34:58.769
Touched the bottom.

00:34:58.772 --> 00:35:01.702
So he came to Me and he said, "I
don't know what has happened.

00:35:01.712 --> 00:35:04.812
There's no water, not a drop."

00:35:04.822 --> 00:35:07.172
I said, "Really?"

00:35:07.182 --> 00:35:09.682
"It's dried out."

00:35:09.682 --> 00:35:13.215
So I said, "All right, you take one coconut."

00:35:13.220 --> 00:35:15.885
He said,"Your coconut is lying there."

00:35:15.890 --> 00:35:21.252
I said, "Take another one." It wouldn't.
He took another one, it wouldn't

00:35:21.282 --> 00:35:23.532
Then I said, "All right, you get your realisation."

00:35:23.522 --> 00:35:26.472
We gave him realisation, this that.

00:35:26.493 --> 00:35:29.852
Then he said, "I would like to sell this well to You."

00:35:29.873 --> 00:35:34.113
He sold it to Me, again the water came in.

00:35:34.143 --> 00:35:36.643
Poor fellow, now he didn’t
know what to do with that.

00:35:36.663 --> 00:35:40.294
So we bought that well. Hari knows about it.

00:35:40.333 --> 00:35:43.334
We bought that well and now
that well is again all right.

00:35:45.133 --> 00:35:48.476
So the nature is a great friend of Sahaja yogis.

00:35:48.494 --> 00:35:50.994
This is what I am trying to say.

00:35:50.994 --> 00:35:53.494
Whatever you want, it will work out for you.

00:35:53.506 --> 00:35:57.024
See how the rain came.

00:35:57.016 --> 00:35:59.516
Least expected at this time.

00:35:59.514 --> 00:36:05.846
You needed it and when I was in the plane
only, I saw all the thundering going on.

00:36:07.691 --> 00:36:24.568
In Perth, when we went to the place where they have built a very beautiful cottage, it was all parched and all brown.

00:36:24.598 --> 00:36:27.910
When I came it was all green, absolutely green.
