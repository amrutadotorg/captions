00:29.620 --> 00:32.190
Would you like a drink, Shri Mataji?

00:34.425 --> 00:35.420
Diet Coke.

00:48.627 --> 00:55.062
So we are with the nature here. So beautiful!

01:06.508 --> 01:12.272
The way it is planned you can see how the person who has planned it had the feel of the land,

01:12.272 --> 01:14.552
feel of the nature.

01:14.552 --> 01:20.862
How he has made up, by not destroying it.

01:20.860 --> 01:25.144
Whatever is there he used it,

01:25.152 --> 01:28.822
otherwise they would have put one
bulldozer and finished it off.

01:31.432 --> 01:37.822
The way it is planned shows he had
feeling for the land and he could understand.

01:39.639 --> 01:44.073
The way we look at nature also, is our own.

01:44.096 --> 01:46.596
The way we are inside, that’s how we look at nature.

01:47.846 --> 01:51.785
Nature is our friend absolutely;
it's working for us all the time.

01:52.694 --> 01:55.194
And we don’t do much for it.

01:57.272 --> 02:01.792
Look at these trees.

02:01.782 --> 02:05.902
They give shade, they give fruits.

02:05.910 --> 02:09.045
Whatever is possible for them, they do it.

02:10.954 --> 02:15.575
And when they are old, we use them for wood.

02:17.345 --> 02:19.845
All supportive to our life.

02:21.513 --> 02:29.732
But we must have feeling; otherwise, what’s happening today is this ecological problem.

02:37.423 --> 02:44.933
And this is because we do not have
any feeling for the Mother Earth.

02:44.947 --> 02:47.447
No feeling for the nature.

02:48.499 --> 02:54.749
We are really plundering her
and then the whole thing reacts.

03:00.647 --> 03:09.784
It's a kind of an aggression that

03:09.805 --> 03:13.634
you want to have so many
things at the same time.

03:15.717 --> 03:20.482
Like I have seen once, first
when we went to England,

03:20.498 --> 03:31.126
we never served any drinks in our house in India, but in England nobody would come to your house, so we had to organise.

03:31.160 --> 03:34.126
I told C.P. that “You better
do something about it.”

03:35.760 --> 03:41.633
So he went and bought some
books, how to organise.

03:41.633 --> 03:46.542
So first the question of tumblers.

03:46.542 --> 03:50.963
And so many types of tumblers you had to use.

03:50.975 --> 03:57.415
I mean in those days, this was I’m telling
you, 1973, or say beginning of ’74.

03:58.420 --> 04:08.044
The first lot we had to get cost us
nine thousand pounds. First total.

04:08.044 --> 04:13.391
But we had to get about twenty-four of
the best crystal, the best crystal.

04:17.550 --> 04:24.576
Because for everything there's a different
type of a crystal that you have to have.

04:25.406 --> 04:30.216
I just thought that if you had some
silver, it would be much better.

04:30.214 --> 04:37.890
One glass of silver is sufficient, once for all your lifetime, your children’s lifetime.

04:37.896 --> 04:41.147
Instead of that, all these things like crystal.

04:41.146 --> 04:47.546
But at least it was crystal, it was all right
because it was in a way, some sort of an art.

04:50.494 --> 04:59.093
And then I learnt how they make, even in England, etching and all that. Beautiful in Scotland!

04:59.114 --> 05:03.663
English crystal also is nice.
The best is Czechoslovakian.

05:03.660 --> 05:12.467
All these things I learnt there with
that horrible sets of tumblers

05:13.905 --> 05:20.192
and you had to have the best quality,

05:20.214 --> 05:27.052
that’s something, part of the prestige, you see.

05:27.073 --> 05:32.382
So somebody will come and just
see the glass,

05:35.672 --> 05:37.623
slowly, you see.

05:37.616 --> 05:42.854
And the plates also, they’ll
come and just turn round.

05:42.876 --> 05:45.404
First I didn’t know what was happening.

05:45.423 --> 05:48.654
Because that’s not done in India,
I mean nobody’s bothered, you see.

05:48.664 --> 05:53.064
Only if there’s art they will appreciate, finished.

05:53.074 --> 05:58.452
We don’t have Saville Rows and all
that in India, so it's different.

05:58.447 --> 06:07.922
And that’s what I felt, that so many
tumblers are needed for one household.

06:09.295 --> 06:16.806
So, they are spending so much
money to buy all these varieties.

06:20.100 --> 06:24.936
But the worst is in America and
now they’re suffering from it.

06:24.955 --> 06:27.455
Even in plastic they have varieties.

06:29.547 --> 06:32.926
So you go to somebody’s house, so they…

06:55.372 --> 07:06.153
So even in plastic they would, say, they have plastic tumblers which are just usable once.

07:06.153 --> 07:10.433
So they use once that, then it’s thrown out.

07:10.451 --> 07:15.503
Even in the drawing room, in a, say, restaurant or anything,

07:15.524 --> 07:17.656
even in their own drawing
rooms they have plastics.

07:17.671 --> 07:19.529
Can you imagine?

07:20.979 --> 07:24.909
And then they will use a lot
of paper, plastic things.

07:24.909 --> 07:27.409
They never have proper plates.

07:28.619 --> 07:31.537
They may be very rich but they
are always on the picnic,

07:31.557 --> 07:38.897
you see, eating with the paper
plates, using plastic things.

07:38.897 --> 07:42.007
But they are so proud of it.

07:42.017 --> 07:47.197
You see, this is a new on that has come now in the plastic scene.

07:49.357 --> 07:52.902
But what is so great about
this? It's after all plastic.

07:52.922 --> 07:56.392
It's new, you see, new.  New is the idea.

07:58.456 --> 08:02.934
Then everything has to be different. Every year.

08:02.957 --> 08:05.457
So this is the fashion this
year, so this kind of clothes

08:26.642 --> 08:32.732
Now they go on discarding this plastic
that they use, then dresses also.

08:32.732 --> 08:36.032
This is the fashion in Paris,
so that’s the dress comes in.

08:37.002 --> 08:41.702
Then the entrepreneurs have really
made us slaves out of that.

08:41.707 --> 08:49.982
Now, if you are dressed differently they say,
“Oh, you are out of fashions, out of date.”

08:49.982 --> 08:52.957
So one lady came to see Me.

08:52.978 --> 09:03.238
She had pants cut here, here, jeans
you see cut here, there, everywhere.

09:03.248 --> 09:07.656
I was just worried that if
she sits on, may give way.

09:07.656 --> 09:09.976
The way it was cut.

09:09.986 --> 09:16.536
And a funny type of a shirt with all cuttings
everywhere, all the threads coming out.

09:17.644 --> 09:21.444
So I said, "Why are you dressed up like this?"

09:21.452 --> 09:23.952
"I'm up to date."

09:33.752 --> 09:39.226
So I asked her, "What about
Me?" "You're antique!"

09:40.887 --> 09:45.297
I said, "Antique is more
precious that up- to-date."

09:50.101 --> 09:56.984
So in India, we say that these people
have got now the desire to be beggars.

09:57.015 --> 09:58.654
With everything beggarish!

09:58.654 --> 10:05.435
The houses are beggarish, dresses are
beggarish, the hair are beggarish.

10:05.414 --> 10:07.914
To add up to it, drugs have come,

10:07.914 --> 10:17.421
so it’s all absolutely… you feel you are
in some sort of a fish market, smelling.

10:17.428 --> 10:22.091
The way people live is… I mean, they
are no way better than our slumming,

10:23.391 --> 10:26.721
the way they live, the way
they eat, the way they like.

10:26.704 --> 10:30.224
They have money, not that
they don’t have money.

10:30.238 --> 10:33.934
Well they probably pay lots of money
for the clothes with the cuts in.

10:33.934 --> 10:38.603
Oh, they pay more for that. They pay more.

10:38.607 --> 10:44.683
But you go to any house you
see, England is worse this way,

10:45.473 --> 10:51.456
and when I was searching for a house,
we had to go from places to places.

10:51.476 --> 10:53.976
Quite big houses we were looking out for.

10:55.382 --> 11:01.426
Suddenly, you find two legs of
pants falling on you from somewhere,

11:01.426 --> 11:03.726
and then some shirts
coming on your faces.

11:03.726 --> 11:05.786
I said, "What's this?"

11:05.796 --> 11:09.004
"Oh, these are old clothes we have, you see."

11:09.896 --> 11:10.854
"Since long?"

11:10.854 --> 11:13.354
"Oh no! This was last year's."

11:13.360 --> 11:15.512
"Why are you keeping them?"

11:15.500 --> 11:18.032
"What to do?"

11:20.912 --> 11:24.822
"You better throw them away. It's
no good, give it away to someone."

11:26.996 --> 11:29.956
"No, we are keeping them. Maybe
the fashion might come back."

11:29.956 --> 11:33.486
Piles and piles and piles.

11:33.486 --> 11:39.853
You get into a room and suddenly
you are on a pile of dirty clothes.

11:39.862 --> 11:42.362
So untidy! So horribly lousy!

11:44.669 --> 11:47.642
This is advancement.

11:47.635 --> 11:50.135
This is what we have progressed.

11:50.441 --> 11:55.707
So this funny greed of having
more and more and more and more,

11:55.720 --> 11:59.007
I mean, you can have, but
have something artistic

11:59.020 --> 12:02.344
so you won’t have too many
things, you’ll have few.

12:02.344 --> 12:06.550
If you try to have artistic things,
then you will have some few things.

12:06.548 --> 12:09.048
But if you want to buy
plastic, there’s no end to it.

12:15.368 --> 12:22.413
The clothes are all artificial these days
and in that the fashions are changing.

12:22.414 --> 12:27.584
So we should not be slave of these entrepreneurs
who are just befooling us all the time.

12:27.591 --> 12:30.091
In the market something comes up funny,

12:30.091 --> 12:34.413
transparent clothes, you see, made of plastic.

12:35.973 --> 12:40.673
Something absurd, you know sometimes
the clothes are very absurd.

12:40.673 --> 12:44.173
Like they had very tight
jeans once upon a time.

12:44.174 --> 12:48.775
And they tighten it by … they said
that you wear it and get into the tub.

12:48.775 --> 12:51.525
And when you come out they
just stick to your body.

12:51.535 --> 12:54.035
And then you bathe with it all the time.

12:54.035 --> 12:57.745
I don’t know if they bathe
also, that’s another point.

12:57.745 --> 13:02.115
Now, it’s such a funny
thing that with this,

13:02.119 --> 13:06.003
the ladies couldn’t get into the buses
so they were to be pushed in you see.

13:12.871 --> 13:16.861
But the worst was that they
developed varicose veins.

13:19.752 --> 13:23.270
So they would come to Me.
I said, “Why did you wear?”

13:23.270 --> 13:26.940
So that was the fashion. Then
they started with the baggy ones,

13:26.970 --> 13:29.350
with the holes, holy pants.

13:29.340 --> 13:36.798
Like that, you see, moving from one to
another, having too many things of no value.

13:36.798 --> 13:42.614
So the Sahaja yogis should understand
that we are friends of the nature.

13:42.619 --> 13:47.170
And whatever nature gives
us, we have to respect it.

13:47.196 --> 13:49.696
Better wear natural clothes as far as possible.

13:52.957 --> 13:59.865
One natural shirt is better
than three unnatural ones,

13:59.865 --> 14:05.139
because you can breathe better, your skin
breathes better, you can wash it better.

14:05.159 --> 14:07.926
So best is to take to more natural things.

14:07.926 --> 14:13.211
I think this trend is coming up,
and that’s a very good trend,

14:13.211 --> 14:16.456
that we should take to natural things.

14:16.456 --> 14:23.131
And when we take to natural things, there’s
one thing we cannot have too many of it.

14:23.147 --> 14:30.127
But if you start using something
plastic, then there can be any number

14:30.149 --> 14:34.653
and that's how you really
torture the Mother Earth.

14:34.653 --> 14:37.153
First of all, you dig her out.

14:37.153 --> 14:40.521
Then you wear all these things.

14:40.586 --> 14:43.558
And they cannot be destroyed.

14:43.572 --> 14:46.072
There are mountains and mountains!

14:46.072 --> 14:50.251
Mountains and mountains of this
plastic if you go in America.

14:50.243 --> 14:55.158
Even in England I’ve seen
mountains, such a filthy sight.

14:55.150 --> 15:00.278
They can’t burn it. If you
put it in the sea, it floats.

15:01.090 --> 15:09.682
And wherever you go near all these so - called very big cities,

15:09.687 --> 15:18.779
if you see the sea from the aeroplane
you find all littered up completely.

15:18.786 --> 15:27.278
So we are spoiling our beaches, we are
spoiling our homes and wasting our money.

15:29.578 --> 15:33.930
So these entrepreneurs have
no feelings for the nature.

15:35.246 --> 15:38.596
They never think what nature is like.

15:42.517 --> 15:45.146
When I wanted to build this Pratishthan,

15:45.145 --> 15:50.938
the five six architects from
India (they’re Sahaja yogis also)

15:50.947 --> 15:54.918
very well qualified but in
the Western manner, you know.

15:56.616 --> 16:07.811
So the design they made was some sort of a colonial style house with a platform all along

16:07.811 --> 16:10.871
because the land was like this, you see.

16:10.884 --> 16:15.811
So they took the zero point as the highest.

16:15.792 --> 16:21.212
So you hang on a platform, for which
you have to pay enormous amount.

16:21.212 --> 16:28.162
I said, " All the way we have not come
to this place to hang in the air.

16:28.178 --> 16:30.506
They couldn't understand
what I was talking to them.

16:30.508 --> 16:33.008
I said, "I want to stick to the ground

16:33.008 --> 16:35.508
I'll build the house on the ground."

16:36.698 --> 16:41.237
They said, "You have to make a topography,
you have to make this 'graphy,' that 'graphy.'

16:41.242 --> 16:46.167
"This is very simple. What is this
'graphies' you are making? Just get to it.

16:48.471 --> 16:52.048
Luckily, they had gone all of them
on leave for about fifteen days.

16:52.048 --> 16:54.548
I changed the whole lot.

16:55.687 --> 16:59.331
And we would have been
hanging on twenty-two feet high.

17:00.377 --> 17:08.468
So I put one hall underneath that.

17:08.481 --> 17:14.108
And when you are moving down, you never
feel that you are going down that low.

17:15.348 --> 17:21.421
And it’s the personality of the nature
which is expressed in that house.

17:21.420 --> 17:23.920
It’s very interesting.

17:23.935 --> 17:26.601
You have seen Pratishthan?

17:26.615 --> 17:29.115
You see, did you feel that
you are going too much down?

17:29.115 --> 17:30.878
Nobody feels that way.

17:30.898 --> 17:33.398
You don't actually feel
you are going down at all.

17:35.185 --> 17:37.118
Well it is.

17:38.280 --> 17:40.984
but after fifteen days they returned.

17:40.983 --> 17:42.443
All go!

17:42.463 --> 17:43.513
"What?"

17:43.533 --> 17:44.864
"How?"

17:44.864 --> 17:49.394
It's going to happen." I said, "Nothing
going to happen, take it from Me."

17:49.378 --> 17:55.152
I’ve used it the best way one has to use and
nothing is going to happen to your building

17:55.176 --> 17:56.402
And they were after the builder.

17:56.402 --> 18:00.142
The builder said, "Shri Mataji
praised me, so I'm not bothered."

18:02.182 --> 18:05.824
And it all worked out so well. So well!

18:05.822 --> 18:11.374
So this is what it is in the...
it's also labour saving, you see.

18:11.374 --> 18:15.242
If you ask somebody, “Why
do you wear plastic?”

18:15.255 --> 18:19.534
they say, “You don’t have to press it.”

18:19.535 --> 18:22.035
But what’s the harm in pressing?

18:22.875 --> 18:28.894
You see there’s one cloth if you have to press it’s all right, it’s a good idea, or don’t press.

18:28.894 --> 18:33.826
Don’t want to press, don’t press,
you’ll look quite neat, doesn’t matter.

18:33.823 --> 18:41.423
But what is the need, I don’t
understand, to have so many plastics?

18:41.422 --> 18:46.009
So Sahaja yogis should avoid
plastic things as far as possible,

18:45.995 --> 18:53.102
especially for children, one should be
careful not to make them wear plastics.

18:58.739 --> 19:01.000
All of them are here, isn't it?

19:01.009 --> 19:03.509
A gathering of the clans Mother!

19:03.510 --> 19:05.162
They must be going home.

19:05.153 --> 19:10.372
Either they are having a birthday
party... or must be doing a training exercise.

19:10.386 --> 19:12.886
Or celebrating some rescue work.

19:15.847 --> 19:18.826
Why! Look at that (unclear)

19:26.724 --> 19:32.864
What about plastic toys for the
children? Is that a bad thing?

19:35.384 --> 19:37.976
Not very good for them.

19:37.984 --> 19:44.126
Also these plastic napkins you
use for children are not necessary

19:44.119 --> 19:49.616
Then you see, you become unattentive
to children also with that.

19:52.621 --> 19:58.217
I mean, toys they play for a while but still
sometimes they put it in the mouth and…

20:05.077 --> 20:13.063
If you see, children are more fond of things
made out of cloth or made out of wood.

20:13.059 --> 20:16.683
They like it. They like the feel of it.

20:16.678 --> 20:26.348
You put five plastic things and one thing made out of wood or made out of cloth, they’ll pick up the cloth one.

20:26.348 --> 20:28.848
They like the feel of the
smoothness of it, you see.

20:30.894 --> 20:37.225
They’re very expensive here, I agree,
but in India they’re very cheap.

20:37.225 --> 20:40.345
This time in Madras I don’t know
if you picked up something or not,

20:40.345 --> 20:44.035
lots of things were there for sale for children.

20:46.115 --> 20:51.755
You see, they wouldn’t stop My car anywhere, I was on the run, otherwise I would have bought.

20:51.754 --> 20:58.059
The wooden toys for girls are very good in India. Beautiful!

20:58.069 --> 21:00.569
Also for boys!

21:02.770 --> 21:06.787
But the plastic toys which are
covered with cloth are all right.

21:06.801 --> 21:09.301
Not so dangerous!

21:15.902 --> 21:19.894
Plastic is something that
penetrates into everything.

21:19.903 --> 21:22.403
Into everything!

21:24.663 --> 21:27.163
We also give too many toys to our children.

21:29.113 --> 21:34.223
In our days, a girl would have
only one doll or two dolls now.

21:35.152 --> 21:38.494
But now the plastic toys,

21:38.494 --> 21:45.034
the whole room is filled with it, I mean you have to just wade through to find out your child in all this.

21:45.015 --> 21:46.655
So many toys!

21:46.675 --> 21:52.145
Perhaps maybe we avoid having
relationship with our children.

21:54.285 --> 22:00.003
We don’t talk to them, we have no time, so give them some toys, stop them, there.

22:00.852 --> 22:03.732
Sort of a diversion.

22:03.732 --> 22:06.672
And that’s how we don’t
know our children at all.

22:07.832 --> 22:09.002
Too many toys.

22:09.001 --> 22:14.021
And the toys also now are coming out

22:14.032 --> 22:18.731
in such a way that’s another slavery because
on the television they’ll advertise it.

22:18.751 --> 22:21.991
Your children will be after
you, "I want that toy."

22:23.440 --> 22:31.350
There was a bear, they took it
out, which had a birth date.

22:31.348 --> 22:44.537
And so they would celebrate the birthday and all the bears were invited you see, for that.

22:44.537 --> 22:52.223
It’s so funny, isn’t it, that
children should be given such ideas?

22:52.223 --> 22:59.506
Because there’s no rapport. If the parents have a rapport with children, children won’t need so much.

22:59.522 --> 23:06.213
You must read some proper stories to
be told to children, talk to them.

23:06.221 --> 23:11.588
If you keep company with them, I don’t
think they’ll ask for toys, too many toys.

23:11.588 --> 23:13.148
They would not.

23:13.158 --> 23:16.628
They’ll be very satisfied, because
most of them are realised souls.

23:16.645 --> 23:25.242
So talk to them in such a manner that they develop their spirituality rather than all these materialistic things.

23:28.513 --> 23:33.292
I have found that we don’t spend
much time with our children.

23:33.302 --> 23:35.492
That’s why they are like this.

23:35.502 --> 23:41.552
We had such a problem. I was telling you about these wise children we had in our school there.

23:41.547 --> 23:44.840
The teachers were mad. They
didn’t know what to do.

23:44.838 --> 23:47.338
They said, "Within one month's
time, we will give up."

23:47.338 --> 23:50.730
They said, "We can't do this any more."

23:52.229 --> 24:04.122
The relationship between the child and parents
should be very sensible and of respect.

24:04.121 --> 24:12.791
Because I have seen that children go on asking questions, “Why? Why?” like that.

24:12.800 --> 24:15.300
You see, it’s kind of an
aggressive nature, that’s all.

24:15.300 --> 24:19.480
They don’t want to know anything.
Just go on asking questions.

24:19.483 --> 24:25.779
At that time you have to tell them, “You are not to know this. There’s no need for you to know.”

24:25.774 --> 24:28.274
You have to shut them.

24:28.274 --> 24:34.259
The quieter child is much
better, who observes, who learns.

24:34.257 --> 24:40.496
But the one who is aggressive becomes
later on a very wild personality.

24:40.512 --> 24:43.556
So to see that your child is not aggressive.

24:43.583 --> 24:47.823
They are exhausting. These
children are absolutely exhausting.

24:47.846 --> 24:51.026
This time I went to Rome.

24:53.977 --> 24:58.876
And I bought some sweets for them.

24:58.876 --> 25:01.736
Some chocolates.

25:01.756 --> 25:10.546
So when I sat down I said, "Now these
children, some lollipops and chocolates."

25:11.836 --> 25:14.680
So they all rushed on to Me,

25:14.676 --> 25:18.090
pushing their hands like this.

25:18.083 --> 25:21.453
I said, "This is not to be done, you
are not beggars. Are you beggars?"

25:21.453 --> 25:23.553
Then they sat back.

25:23.553 --> 25:25.363
They are not beggars.

25:25.353 --> 25:29.452
But say in India you try this, no
child will push forward this way.

25:29.446 --> 25:33.192
If you try to give he’ll feel
shy, he’ll look at the mother.

25:33.210 --> 25:43.102
Should he take it or not? But this comes only
because of the rapport we have with children.

25:43.098 --> 25:45.932
Now how do we have rapport with them?

25:48.098 --> 25:55.886
See now, you take them to the nature
here and see them, how they behave,

25:55.886 --> 25:58.916
what is their style,

25:58.936 --> 26:02.117
what is their treatment?

26:02.140 --> 26:06.877
Instead of making them
run about like mad

26:06.891 --> 26:12.337
or taking out some flowers or doing
some sort of an aggressive act,

26:12.357 --> 26:15.477
just make them sit down. Tell
them, “Now what is this flower?

26:15.491 --> 26:17.991
Do you know the name of this flower?

26:17.991 --> 26:20.999
Now this one, do you know what that flower is?"

26:21.029 --> 26:26.769
I mean many parents don't know themselves.
I don't know if they can explain.

26:26.776 --> 26:28.959
Then, "What is this tree?"

26:28.959 --> 26:30.861
Look at the nature.

26:30.866 --> 26:34.881
Put the attention of the
children on to something

26:34.876 --> 26:41.331
which will make them more
contented and more deeper.

26:41.316 --> 26:45.449
Instead of that, as soon as they see
the space they just start running.

26:45.473 --> 26:47.599
You don’t know what to do with them.

26:47.613 --> 26:53.459
It is because you have not taught them how to be concentrated on something very interesting.

26:53.459 --> 26:57.406
Now see, I am sitting here. I am
sitting watching these stones.

26:57.425 --> 26:59.306
Even this will be in My head.

26:59.315 --> 27:03.286
See what a beautiful fibre,
just see, just see. Beautiful!

27:03.283 --> 27:04.626
This is nature.

27:04.626 --> 27:10.846
And if once children start appreciating
it, their attention will be more on this

27:10.873 --> 27:13.373
than on something
nonsensical, you see.

27:27.817 --> 27:34.585
So a rapport needs to be established
and an understanding of the children.

27:34.607 --> 27:37.107
An appreciation. When they do something good,

27:37.107 --> 27:38.795
you must appreciate.

27:38.795 --> 27:43.365
And when they are doing something, mostly they
do wrong things just to attract your attention.

27:43.365 --> 27:50.475
If you don’t pay any attention to that and just distract their attention, to something else, it’s very easy.

27:50.475 --> 27:57.035
For example, now if you are going to somebody’s
house, the children are going with us;

27:57.032 --> 28:01.552
before going we tell them, “See now,
you have to behave there properly,

28:01.552 --> 28:05.302
otherwise they’ll think that
your parents are no good.

28:05.312 --> 28:11.578
Now we go there. You should not,
in no way try to misbehave.

28:11.578 --> 28:14.431
Shouldn't ask for anything. Just keep quiet."

28:14.428 --> 28:17.991
So first of all, you tell them how to behave.

28:17.991 --> 28:22.905
Now when they go there and they behave properly
when you come back, you have to tell them,

28:22.905 --> 28:27.475
“This is tremendous. You have been so good.

28:27.492 --> 28:30.325
You behaved so well, it's really very good.

28:30.325 --> 28:34.395
I'm so proud of you. So next time even better.

28:37.598 --> 28:42.838
Then you have to tell them about
their dignity,

28:42.842 --> 28:46.408
about what they are.

28:46.423 --> 28:49.278
And also the dignity of the nature.

28:49.283 --> 28:52.402
“See how dignified the tree is.

28:52.412 --> 28:55.492
How it is standing there for giving a shade.”

28:55.502 --> 28:57.882
So they develop that feeling within them.

28:57.882 --> 29:06.524
If you do not have feeling for the nature, you cannot stop these ecological problems.

29:06.524 --> 29:09.024
That's important, very important.

29:11.784 --> 29:17.401
Luckily, with Sahaja Yoga,
Hamid has done some research

29:17.396 --> 29:23.565
and he has worked on the trees near Austria.

29:23.588 --> 29:34.924
There’s a very beautiful mountainous area, much higher than this, between Germany and Austria.

29:34.923 --> 29:39.503
There used to be some sort
of wasps, were really fatal.

29:39.516 --> 29:50.046
Now they have all disappeared and the trees are crumbling down with this acid rain and getting completely destroyed.

29:50.061 --> 29:52.561
So the government asked him to
do some experiment with them.

29:54.181 --> 30:02.934
So, he took My vibrated water in a puja and he mixed it with other water, put it everywhere.

30:02.949 --> 30:11.342
So he said, “All the trees about
sixty years of age didn’t react much.

30:11.342 --> 30:21.201
But below that, they all reacted
and they started looking healthier.”

30:21.213 --> 30:23.713
But he said still, the speed was not there.

30:23.713 --> 30:30.286
So there were lots of these badges from America left over

30:30.306 --> 30:34.196
So he went and pushed them into every tree.

30:34.196 --> 30:38.896
And he said, “I went there after six
months and the whole thing was changed,

30:38.906 --> 30:42.740
vibrated and it's all so green, so beautiful.

30:45.710 --> 30:49.570
It’s a remarkable thing to happen.

30:49.570 --> 30:56.975
So I think My picture must be giving
balance or something to this acid rain,

30:56.975 --> 30:59.390
or it nourishes these trees.

30:59.390 --> 31:04.525
The vibrations after all, vibrations do nourish everything,

31:04.511 --> 31:08.535
and I don’t know what happened to the acid rain.

31:08.546 --> 31:11.046
It’s very different.

31:12.536 --> 31:20.175
We can try that everywhere,
vibrated water and these badges.

31:20.188 --> 31:23.673
Even the rings have done great works.

31:23.673 --> 31:29.017
He had a problem because they don’t
have well as we have in India.

31:29.042 --> 31:31.208
They only have those taps.

31:31.202 --> 31:42.421
So he removed the joining ring and put his
ring inside that, and then he joined it.

31:42.424 --> 31:49.265
With that ring only, it worked
wonders, can you imagine?

31:50.769 --> 31:53.269
Ah, just imagine.

31:54.889 --> 31:57.389
Maybe the ring was emitting.... (break in recording)

31:58.901 --> 32:08.961
...what is our status and what is our position.

32:08.970 --> 32:11.470
We are something very different from others.

32:11.481 --> 32:13.981
We have so much capacities.

32:15.576 --> 32:26.960
So we must understand what we can do to
really improve the conditions around us,

32:26.967 --> 32:29.467
our children, everything,

32:29.467 --> 32:33.726
because now you have that
vital force which you can use.

32:35.281 --> 32:40.815
But many Sahaja yogis are such, they do not understand

32:40.835 --> 32:48.547
that Sahaja Yoga is not for only for your personal cleanliness or for your personal ascent,

32:48.547 --> 32:56.107
but for the ascent of the whole
universe, of the whole people.

32:56.117 --> 32:59.471
Anywhere there’s a Sahaja yogi you can make it out.

32:59.467 --> 33:10.226
Once I was going in a village and I saw a
beautiful, very beautiful field of corn.

33:10.236 --> 33:15.786
Such beautiful corn, such thick, thick seeds in it.

33:16.916 --> 33:19.506
He said, "Whose field?"

33:19.516 --> 33:22.466
I asked the Sahaja yogi, I said, "Whose field is this?"

33:22.486 --> 33:24.986
He said, "This is mine."

33:26.636 --> 33:28.040
"What did you do?"

33:28.046 --> 33:34.778
"I just got one coconut vibrated by You and put it my well."

33:38.759 --> 33:41.436
All these miracles are happening.

33:41.456 --> 33:47.516
Something, when I was building Pratishthan
you see, we didn’t have water or well there.

33:47.517 --> 33:50.426
So the neighbour said, “My well
is lying here, you can use it,

33:50.421 --> 33:53.868
but it only can work for a few days.

33:53.877 --> 33:57.478
You'll have to arrange for water to build the house.

33:57.497 --> 34:00.268
I said, “All right.”

34:00.264 --> 34:05.848
So the first thing Sahaja yogis did was
to put My vibrated water in that well

34:05.838 --> 34:08.888
and one coconut.

34:08.908 --> 34:13.378
Suddenly that well started getting filled up.

34:15.390 --> 34:19.768
And while building, you see there’s a big ball kept there,

34:19.791 --> 34:21.318
to suck the water up.

34:21.331 --> 34:23.831
The ball was hanging in the air,
but still the water was coming.

34:25.496 --> 34:29.990
And the whole of Pratishthan was built with that water.

34:30.001 --> 34:36.144
We never had to buy any water and
everybody was amazed. How can it be?

34:36.154 --> 34:43.844
But the water from, I don’t know from
where that source, but just sucked it.

34:43.876 --> 34:47.988
Till we finished the house,
there was water in that well.

34:48.018 --> 34:54.219
Then the fellow said, “I want this
well for my own use."  He'll use it for himself.

34:54.232 --> 34:56.732
Immediately it dried up.

34:56.732 --> 34:58.769
Touched the bottom.

34:58.772 --> 35:01.702
So he came to Me and he said, "I
don't know what has happened.

35:01.712 --> 35:04.812
There's no water, not a drop."

35:04.822 --> 35:07.172
I said, "Really?"

35:07.182 --> 35:09.682
"It's dried out."

35:09.682 --> 35:13.215
So I said, "All right, you take one coconut."

35:13.220 --> 35:15.885
He said,"Your coconut is lying there."

35:15.890 --> 35:21.252
I said, "Take another one." It wouldn't.
He took another one, it wouldn't

35:21.282 --> 35:23.532
Then I said, "All right, you get your realisation."

35:23.522 --> 35:26.472
We gave him realisation, this that.

35:26.493 --> 35:29.852
Then he said, "I would like to sell this well to You."

35:29.873 --> 35:34.113
He sold it to Me, again the water came in.

35:34.143 --> 35:36.643
Poor fellow, now he didn’t
know what to do with that.

35:36.663 --> 35:40.294
So we bought that well. Hari knows about it.

35:40.333 --> 35:43.334
We bought that well and now
that well is again all right.

35:45.133 --> 35:48.476
So the nature is a great friend of Sahaja yogis.

35:48.494 --> 35:50.994
This is what I am trying to say.

35:50.994 --> 35:53.494
Whatever you want, it will work out for you.

35:53.506 --> 35:57.024
See how the rain came.

35:57.016 --> 35:59.516
Least expected at this time.

35:59.514 --> 36:05.846
You needed it and when I was in the plane
only, I saw all the thundering going on.

36:07.691 --> 36:24.568
In Perth, when we went to the place where they have built a very beautiful cottage, it was all parched and all brown.

36:24.598 --> 36:27.910
When I came it was all green, absolutely green.
