00:11.710 --> 00:22.580
now you should see there is no data on

00:14.570 --> 00:31.910
the hamsa chakra but it is the formless

00:22.580 --> 00:41.059
energy of so many organs which are

00:31.910 --> 00:43.480
looked after by Buddha Mahavira Christ

00:41.059 --> 00:49.329
Shri Krishna

00:43.480 --> 00:51.980
four of them managed by Shri Ganesha

00:49.329 --> 00:54.890
so these genetics are put by Shri

00:51.980 --> 00:59.390
Ganesha because he is the source of

00:54.890 --> 01:06.500
wisdom so first once they spoil their

00:59.390 --> 01:09.670
more adhara the wisdom is finished base

01:06.500 --> 01:13.250
is the fundamentals are finished

01:09.670 --> 01:18.830
that's why immoral life is very

01:13.250 --> 01:25.959
detrimental to our life because we lose

01:18.830 --> 01:25.959
our discretion the discretion is lost

01:27.270 --> 01:39.149
then if you can awaken Shri Ganesha in

01:32.280 --> 01:42.030
the hamsa chakra then suddenly you

01:39.149 --> 01:47.369
belong to the higher race of sahaja

01:42.030 --> 01:50.539
Yogi's it's surprising I have seen

01:47.369 --> 01:53.189
people overnight give up their drugs

01:50.539 --> 01:57.329
very immoral people become extremely

01:53.189 --> 02:01.229
modern because of this chakra being

01:57.329 --> 02:06.770
suddenly awakened and the light of the

02:01.229 --> 02:12.780
Spirit is best expressed through this

02:06.770 --> 02:17.340
chakra in everyday life in the

02:12.780 --> 02:23.370
collective life also one start then

02:17.340 --> 02:25.769
seeing the point as we say like now in

02:23.370 --> 02:29.760
sahaja yoga we have different problems

02:25.769 --> 02:32.790
also say when people first come to

02:29.760 --> 02:36.810
sahaja yoga they start watching other

02:32.790 --> 02:41.310
people and starting finding their faults

02:36.810 --> 02:43.850
what's wrong with them they never see

02:41.310 --> 02:46.739
what they are here for they are not here

02:43.850 --> 02:49.889
to find out falls for the dots but to

02:46.739 --> 02:51.930
correct your own defense so they say oh

02:49.889 --> 02:54.090
this man is no good that man is no good

02:51.930 --> 02:58.319
this is wrong they start creating

02:54.090 --> 03:00.329
problems they'll talk to each other

02:58.319 --> 03:03.030
saying oh this man is not good that man

03:00.329 --> 03:08.280
is not go try to create groups and

03:03.030 --> 03:15.530
things they are here talk for what or

03:08.280 --> 03:15.530
create a politics or for your ascent

03:15.910 --> 03:21.580
some of them if they do not do all this

03:19.090 --> 03:23.620
then they think we should start to make

03:21.580 --> 03:31.350
some money out of it or some sort of a

03:23.620 --> 03:36.970
thing or some start criticizing others

03:31.350 --> 03:39.180
about something which is not their

03:36.970 --> 03:39.180
concern

03:42.110 --> 03:46.970
so they forget because they're just now

03:44.570 --> 03:49.970
coming to sahaja yoga and their genetics

03:46.970 --> 03:54.860
are not established of their wisdom they

03:49.970 --> 03:58.490
start worrying about things which are

03:54.860 --> 04:04.430
not their worry which they should not

03:58.490 --> 04:08.930
bother about then some of them start

04:04.430 --> 04:12.320
thinking oh I am the leader or why am I

04:08.930 --> 04:15.620
not the leader so they start finding

04:12.320 --> 04:18.799
fault with the leadership sometimes

04:15.620 --> 04:22.660
leader also can few know who I am the

04:18.799 --> 04:22.660
leader I can be very stern very

04:23.710 --> 04:30.919
disciplinarian I can control people I

04:26.780 --> 04:36.440
can do this they have come here to learn

04:30.919 --> 04:47.350
how to love to be compassionate to be

04:36.440 --> 04:55.900
tolerant the sense of leadership and

04:47.350 --> 04:55.900
also of obedience both hard is Krishna

04:55.960 --> 05:02.180
if somebody says something to you and if

05:00.020 --> 05:08.720
you obey that person for your

05:02.180 --> 05:12.310
benevolence you will subtle certainly

05:08.720 --> 05:15.590
understand that it is for your good if

05:12.310 --> 05:18.530
some leader says that this is wrong with

05:15.590 --> 05:23.600
you try to see if it is wrong instead of

05:18.530 --> 05:24.350
feeling hurt about it yes it is wrong so

05:23.600 --> 05:26.780
what should I do

05:24.350 --> 05:28.550
how can I improve myself ask the leader

05:26.780 --> 05:30.470
or you can write to me or do anything

05:28.550 --> 05:32.090
but no they will not do it immediately

05:30.470 --> 05:34.370
they write their letter to me saying

05:32.090 --> 05:37.910
this leader is such a such bad fellow

05:34.370 --> 05:44.090
he's so this they ate that money he ate

05:37.910 --> 05:45.890
that thing and all kinds of or else they

05:44.090 --> 05:47.990
may tell people Oh mother listens to

05:45.890 --> 05:49.400
this fellow he is no good he is just

05:47.990 --> 05:53.569
stunning mother story he's a mother

05:49.400 --> 06:00.589
raises her mother is not such a fool

05:53.569 --> 06:03.349
she knows about everything so all these

06:00.589 --> 06:05.719
things that we have gathered from our

06:03.349 --> 06:08.270
previous life even after our second

06:05.719 --> 06:10.399
birth we carried little bit like an egg

06:08.270 --> 06:13.249
becomes a bird but still lots of things

06:10.399 --> 06:17.300
of the egg are hanging onto his body so

06:13.249 --> 06:19.309
you have to cleanse it so at this point

06:17.300 --> 06:22.399
when you have got your realization the

06:19.309 --> 06:26.719
first discussion should be how am I

06:22.399 --> 06:32.149
going to achieve that state of spirit

06:26.719 --> 06:35.209
the pure spirit instead of that also

06:32.149 --> 06:45.169
people get lost because they have no

06:35.209 --> 06:47.269
discussion with this enlightenment first

06:45.169 --> 06:50.719
thing that happens I've seen with people

06:47.269 --> 06:55.749
their eyes are fixed they don't roll

06:50.719 --> 06:55.749
their eyes much now they have very

06:56.080 --> 07:04.610
innocent eyes otherwise they are really

07:01.819 --> 07:06.649
mad those people who go on looking at

07:04.610 --> 07:07.969
everything like this circus is there's

07:06.649 --> 07:10.879
no difference between the mad man and

07:07.969 --> 07:13.699
him we put one mad man he does the same

07:10.879 --> 07:18.729
and a person who is like that does the

07:13.699 --> 07:21.919
same and it's such a crazy thing to do

07:18.729 --> 07:25.729
but immediately I mean it is such a

07:21.919 --> 07:30.129
spontaneous thing it's like the light

07:25.729 --> 07:32.329
coming in the room it is so spontaneous

07:30.129 --> 07:35.499
that you start seeing things clearly

07:32.329 --> 07:35.499
don't know this is not

07:37.830 --> 07:43.470
before in the garden you would go and

07:40.950 --> 07:47.060
collect all the thorns and put them in

07:43.470 --> 07:52.140
your body if that was the situation

07:47.060 --> 07:55.290
never looked at the flowers and suddenly

07:52.140 --> 07:57.030
after realization you'd be amazed you

07:55.290 --> 08:00.180
just see flowers and don't bother about

07:57.030 --> 08:06.210
thoughts or if you find you take them

08:00.180 --> 08:09.060
out there is joy even before realization

08:06.210 --> 08:14.850
and after realization but there's no

08:09.060 --> 08:19.380
capacity to enjoy that capacity comes to

08:14.850 --> 08:25.580
you after realization and the main thing

08:19.380 --> 08:28.290
that happens to you is the discretion

08:25.580 --> 08:35.670
then like this one you just take the

08:28.290 --> 08:39.540
milk of everything but everything your

08:35.670 --> 08:43.470
attitude becomes very different start

08:39.540 --> 08:48.320
seeing things in a different angle like

08:43.470 --> 08:53.640
once we had to go to one very ancient

08:48.320 --> 08:55.980
temple to see some art be my son-in-law

08:53.640 --> 08:59.760
and my daughter we were walking about we

08:55.980 --> 09:01.620
had to walk for miles up the hill and

08:59.760 --> 09:05.640
they were very tired so we went into one

09:01.620 --> 09:08.160
temple and just played on horses they

09:05.640 --> 09:11.060
were so tired at that time I say see

09:08.160 --> 09:15.000
this elephant see how beautiful they are

09:11.060 --> 09:23.010
every one has a different type of a tail

09:15.000 --> 09:25.170
and a different type of a trunk the pose

09:23.010 --> 09:28.440
is are different so many of them are

09:25.170 --> 09:30.450
like that my son-in-law said Baba we are

09:28.440 --> 09:35.310
so tired how are you looking at these

09:30.450 --> 09:38.480
things because attention didn't go to my

09:35.310 --> 09:42.650
tiredness but to those beautiful days

09:38.480 --> 09:47.280
same thing you start sucking in the milk

09:42.650 --> 09:51.000
there is joy but you cannot feel the joy

09:47.280 --> 09:54.750
because the power that subtle power

09:51.000 --> 09:56.819
of divine discretion is not there once

09:54.750 --> 10:01.319
that comes in you start enjoying

09:56.819 --> 10:06.540
everything it's just the same life is

10:01.319 --> 10:11.879
just the same nothing has changed same

10:06.540 --> 10:16.069
house same family same city same

10:11.879 --> 10:22.139
environment but you start enjoying

10:16.069 --> 10:25.529
because the sensitivity of your hamsa

10:22.139 --> 10:28.230
chakra is now only for divine discretion

10:25.529 --> 10:30.800
and you immediately know and then you

10:28.230 --> 10:35.100
don't want to do anything with the

10:30.800 --> 10:37.050
thorns only want to gather flowers and

10:35.100 --> 10:41.790
you know how to gather flowers and you

10:37.050 --> 10:48.930
are in joy so the light of the Spirit

10:41.790 --> 10:53.730
which shines through your I'm such a

10:48.930 --> 10:56.129
tree gives you wisdom wisdom doesn't

10:53.730 --> 10:58.230
mean that you know how to argue things

10:56.129 --> 11:04.920
or you fight with people no it doesn't

10:58.230 --> 11:09.529
mean that wisdom means how you take to

11:04.920 --> 11:14.309
the good side of everything to enjoy it

11:09.529 --> 11:18.839
this is wisdom and that you avoid all

11:14.309 --> 11:22.230
destructive things and take to something

11:18.839 --> 11:25.889
constructive now you are going to say on

11:22.230 --> 11:30.689
a road and is written that there's

11:25.889 --> 11:32.250
danger before realization they words all

11:30.689 --> 11:35.519
right let's see what is dangerous they

11:32.250 --> 11:38.970
jump into it and say that we have what

11:35.519 --> 11:42.209
they wanna by killing themselves such

11:38.970 --> 11:47.939
explanations but a sensible man is on

11:42.209 --> 11:53.300
our danger cope what's the after he

11:47.939 --> 11:56.399
preserves himself he respects his life

11:53.300 --> 12:00.870
because he knows now he has become the

11:56.399 --> 12:03.050
instrument of God so we stop comes to

12:00.870 --> 12:03.050
you

12:03.910 --> 12:10.990
automatically but through experience

12:07.100 --> 12:13.310
then you know this is the right path

12:10.990 --> 12:16.850
through experience you start

12:13.310 --> 12:19.759
understanding nowadays I am telling all

12:16.850 --> 12:21.560
these things to you say if 20 years back

12:19.759 --> 12:23.600
I never talked of these things to them

12:21.560 --> 12:25.430
because I knew if I start talking

12:23.600 --> 12:28.160
they'll say oh she's talking something

12:25.430 --> 12:32.170
out of the blue god knows if it is true

12:28.160 --> 12:36.139
or not but once the wisdom becomes

12:32.170 --> 12:40.550
transparent and you start seeing through

12:36.139 --> 12:45.980
it everything very clearly makes your

12:40.550 --> 12:48.589
mind absolutely clear then anybody who

12:45.980 --> 12:51.529
does things of wisdom you know feel bad

12:48.589 --> 12:55.040
about it on the contrary you thank that

12:51.529 --> 12:59.509
I'm so lucky that I can hear about these

12:55.040 --> 13:03.560
things such nice things and also those

12:59.509 --> 13:08.029
sayings start giving you joy so with the

13:03.560 --> 13:10.009
ear you hear so many things used to hear

13:08.029 --> 13:13.100
the same things might be hearing so much

13:10.009 --> 13:14.439
music everything before also but never

13:13.100 --> 13:18.769
gave you joy

13:14.439 --> 13:20.899
now because of this transformation the

13:18.769 --> 13:26.240
same music which you heard before now

13:20.899 --> 13:29.319
makes you feel as if you are in a

13:26.240 --> 13:32.509
seventh heaven it gives you extra see

13:29.319 --> 13:36.439
the poetry which was quite mundane

13:32.509 --> 13:38.149
ordinary people told me mother it was

13:36.439 --> 13:41.600
such a headache to read William Blake in

13:38.149 --> 13:44.930
those days but now we love it we read it

13:41.600 --> 13:50.660
like Bible because now you develop you

13:44.930 --> 13:53.930
cite new hearing power all these are

13:50.660 --> 13:56.089
called in son sir the a-team Rhea means

13:53.930 --> 13:59.449
the organs which are subtle organs

13:56.089 --> 14:02.750
within us so eyes have a subtle organ

13:59.449 --> 14:08.019
years have a subtle organ and these

14:02.750 --> 14:08.019
settle out and then start everything

14:08.139 --> 14:15.329
such responses

14:10.720 --> 14:21.839
all the surroundings that you just

14:15.329 --> 14:24.180
gather whatever is beautiful say it is

14:21.839 --> 14:28.449
very dark

14:24.180 --> 14:33.339
normally we frightened but if it is very

14:28.449 --> 14:35.079
dark you say oh it's very good how we

14:33.339 --> 14:37.899
are enjoying you know it's such a

14:35.079 --> 14:40.079
venture something we'll go slowly slowly

14:37.899 --> 14:44.500
holding each other's hand

14:40.079 --> 14:46.959
supposing it is very hot then every

14:44.500 --> 14:49.779
somebody says people may start I don't

14:46.959 --> 14:52.839
know what they would do another would

14:49.779 --> 14:54.670
just say it was quite nice day you see

14:52.839 --> 14:57.160
it's nice sometimes to have what is also

14:54.670 --> 15:00.399
very good thing if it is cold the other

14:57.160 --> 15:03.490
way now so this you start enjoying every

15:00.399 --> 15:05.920
aspect which is supposed to be very very

15:03.490 --> 15:08.790
bad for others to you you know the

15:05.920 --> 15:11.769
aspect of that what is to be enjoyed

15:08.790 --> 15:17.800
that part which is to be enjoyed

15:11.769 --> 15:21.209
and once you know how to do it then you

15:17.800 --> 15:25.949
say we are swimming in the ocean of joy

15:21.209 --> 15:32.529
the ocean is the same but now you are

15:25.949 --> 15:37.389
just touching those beautiful drops from

15:32.529 --> 15:42.220
Rosia which are in that ocean and the

15:37.389 --> 15:46.029
rest are worried of getting drowned same

15:42.220 --> 15:51.959
ocean same world that's why they say

15:46.029 --> 15:55.470
it's a Maya but after this discussion is

15:51.959 --> 15:57.970
shining there's no Maya you starting

15:55.470 --> 16:02.079
it's like this supposing you drop

15:57.970 --> 16:06.480
somebody no ocean he'll be so frightened

16:02.079 --> 16:10.000
and he'll die before even he sunk really

16:06.480 --> 16:13.389
but supposing a person there is with all

16:10.000 --> 16:17.250
his things to watch and he is the one

16:13.389 --> 16:19.199
who is going to see all the beauty of

16:17.250 --> 16:23.750
the underworld
