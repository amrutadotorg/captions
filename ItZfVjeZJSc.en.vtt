00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Welcome many people here who have not attended a program of Shri Mataji Nimala Devi.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:20.000
By good fortune we are holding a seminar here this weekend and we had the idea to open it out to a wider public

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:30.000
to share with you the remarkable discovery which is Sahaja Yoga.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Shri Mataji Nimala Devi is an absolutely unique figure in this world and people have come from many European countries to join us this weekend.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:25.000
I am going to ask Gregor de Calvamattin who is a Swiss national who has written a book on the subject of Shri Mataji's advent

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:39.000
to make a presentation before Shri Mataji arrives to give you some orientation.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Why it is that this is such a unique opportunity for all of us at this juncture in our history, in the national history, in the international history, in the very evolution of our species.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:27.000
You may hear some big words this evening but I hope that you are people of a calibre to seek the reality, the truth in big words

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:40.000
and not to be satisfied with superficial answers to sublime questions.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:49.000
We have been having an intensely joyful seminar.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
We want to share that joy with you.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:00.000
There is a very specific way by which that joy can be shared by everyone.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
It is the birthright of everyone.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:10.000
It is nothing especially abnormal.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Everyone has the potential within them to achieve what has been promised.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:48.000
We have very much that later on you will make a point of finding out for yourself individually how much potential you have to transform into the promised state.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Which is very blissful, very peaceful and very nourishing.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Which we call Self-realization.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:19.000
After the program, those who are interested to do so may like to leave their name and address with us in the foyer so that we can be in touch with you about other programs.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Programs are held regularly in London and in many other cities in this country and we look forward to meeting you and getting to know you.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Without further ado, I will ask Gregor to speak to you and to introduce Remar to you who will be here in a few minutes.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:09.000
All right, it is working.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:15.000
Again, good evening to everybody and most welcome.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
It is a very nice surroundings.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
We had a very jolly weekend here.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
We thank you for coming this evening.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:39.000
Now, introducing Sahaja Yoga or Shri Mataji is always a privilege although it is not a very easy topic.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:06:03.000
The reason it is not an easy topic is that the subject matter is slightly beyond the borders of our wildest dreams and while presenting it we have to be very careful not to look like somebody who would be naive to the point of idiosity.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
Is it an English word, idiosity?

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
Okay.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
Because what we are talking about is self-realization.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:18.000
If any of us know what self-realization is about then we know it is a very big thing.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:36.000
It is something that very few saints and sages of the older days used to achieve after lives of tremendous labors and penances dedicated to that very purpose which obviously is not the situation in which I am finding myself.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
I am an international civil servant, a wife, three children and so on.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.000
So that keeps me pretty busy.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:52.000
So self-realization while living in the world, this sounds like utopia.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:07:00.000
I have met Shri Mataji about 10 years ago, slightly more as a person.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.000
And that is enough for me to know it is not utopia, it is reality.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:17.000
Now I have no pretension to communicate this very truth to you because if I have accepted it, it is on the basis of my own experience and not because anybody would tell me so.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:24.000
Actually the people who told me so, I told them that they were, you know, kidding themselves.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:34.000
And I would expect from you the same kind of healthy scepticism, i.e. you shouldn't believe me of course.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:47.000
Somebody who believes people in this world today is somebody who is in for troubles because especially in the field of spirituality, you have all kinds of crazy show going on in town.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
Unfortunately these shows are sometimes very successful.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:08:03.000
So that for someone who is genuine but confused, which seems to be the characteristic of many seekers, certainly, I mean, I would certainly describe myself as being confused.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:09.000
When I think about the state I was before, I met Shri Mataji.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:21.000
It's very difficult to know who is genuine and who is not, who delivers the goods and who doesn't, and who is just a kind of illusion makers.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:35.000
So the way to go about this riddle is just to submit to you that whatever may be said on Sahaja Yoga is for you an hypothesis.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000
And this is probably what Shri Mataji will tell you also in a few minutes.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:51.000
Now, you know that for an hypothesis to be considered as a law, it has to fulfill two requirements.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.000
It has to be communicable and verifiable under certain conditions.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:07.000
So the hypothesis of Sahaja Yoga which is going to be led down or presented for you is going to be verified for those who sow desire, not for the others of course,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:25.000
by a session of meditation at the end of the program of Shri Mataji, in which Shri Mataji will again show her absolutely amazing capacity to play this catalytical role in granting people their self-realization.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:39.000
So if you came here to listen to a lecture, you'll like someone who came and thought he had five dollars in his pocket, but it's not five, it's five thousand dollars.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:49.000
Because really what you can get this evening is much more the analytical knowledge which is communicated by means of words.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000
So this is a kind of introduction to the hypothesis.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:16.000
And I assure you that the only thing it takes to verify what is actually going on is a certain intellectual honesty, that's all.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
Certain genuineness.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
And of course the desire to know what's going on.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:30.000
Not about Sahaja Yoga of course, but what's going on about our own life, about the way to fulfill it.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
Now the hypothesis is very simple.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
This is the framework of the hypothesis.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000
And what we say is this.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000
You have the sacrum bone which is more or less at the bottom of your spine.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:11:02.000
An energy which could be called in our tradition as the residual consciousness of the Holy Spirit in man.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000
This energy is called Kundalini in Sanskrit.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:19.000
Now what we call Self-Realization, that has to be defined, is the following process.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:31.000
It's the process of this energy going up within the spine, crossing this famous point known as the third eye in various esoteric traditions.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:45.000
Going through this beautiful flower here which Lord Buddha described as the thousand petaled lotus.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:50.000
And oozing out of the top of the skull.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:57.000
Now when this takes place, what does it mean, what are the implications?

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
I think Shri Mataji is already coming.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:15.000
What are the implications of this process?

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:26.000
First of all, you can register the process in, I would say, essentially two ways.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:40.000
When the energy crosses this center, the Agnya Chakra, one enters into a state which is a state of silence.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:49.000
Now we all know, we'd rather think a lot and it's not easy to stop thinking even if we wish to do so.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:13:02.000
This state of silence announces the quality of what Lord Jesus Christ has described as the Kingdom of God.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:15.000
Because when one can penetrate farther into this silence, one undoubtedly discovers a new quality of being.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
And I would like to come back on this.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:26.000
Now once the Kundalini is just a couple of centimeters upwards and oozes out of the head, then what happens?

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:34.000
There again, what happens has been referred to in very ancient texts.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:47.000
What actually happens is one feels the manifestation of something which is a cool breeze.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:57.000
And this is a cool breeze which was called as Pneuma onus by the Greek fathers of the church.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:15.000
It was referred to also in the Bible as this mighty wind which erupted in the house where the apostles were gathered for Pentecost.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:23.000
There are many references in various cultures to this phenomenon that we call vibrations.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:31.000
What actually happens is that our central nervous system, which means this physical system by which we feel sensations,

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:39.000
becomes aware of a subtle energy which was always existing before but which we could not perceive.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
It's like you have, let's say, a radio here.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:47.000
If the radio is not switched on, it cannot pick up all the waves.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:55.000
And the music which is in the room in the same way, Self-realization, allows our central nervous system to pick on those waves,

00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:00.000
to feel these vibrations which are a spiritual energy.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:13.000
In other words, this is the meeting point of matter and spirit because with the material structure, one becomes aware of spirit.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:18.000
And this is a breakthrough into the fourth dimension.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:29.000
These vibrations are the category of perception that Kant was requiring in order to know the things in themselves,

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
in order to know reality.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:40.000
And it is because at that time he said that we don't have this new or this other category of perception

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:45.000
to know metaphysical realities, metaphysics, that is what is beyond physics.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:50.000
That is why we should just limit ourselves to rationality and from there on,

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:59.000
the whole demarch, the whole direction of the Western seekers went into basically this finite world

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:08.000
and no more this world which was keeping people like Plato and Socrates busy, the world of the things in themselves, of reality.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:16.000
Now this is important to know because this breakthrough in our category of perception has been sought by so many seekers

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:24.000
that people who know that background, would it be only intellectually, know that one thing has to happen

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:29.000
in order to know reality is that we have to have a new means.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:37.000
And this is how you'll better understand the importance of these vibrations and the importance of what can be done with them.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:45.000
This is such a rich and vast topic that I simply would not like to enter into it now.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:54.000
Now going back to what I said a few minutes ago, this quality of silence one discovers at the level of the Agia Chakra

00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:00.000
is the space of reality between two thought movements.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:11.000
Now the action of this energy which we have called Kundalini pushes the thoughts on the side and then you enter in your own realm.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:19.000
What actually happens is this, is that once the Kundalini is at the top of the head,

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:25.000
there is a secret link between the head and the heart.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:33.000
And the heart is the seat of the self, the spirit, the Atma in Sanskrit.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:43.000
So through this link in your consciousness, in your brain, you start imbibing Atma consciousness.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:51.000
That means you start being aware, conscious of those qualities which are the qualities of the self

00:17:51.000 --> 00:18:01.000
which are called Sat-Chit-Ananda meaning truth, consciousness and bliss.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:13.000
So this is the hypothesis as short as I could.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.000
This is true Shri Mataji.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:19:01.000
This is reading as our recipe.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:17.000
Now as I mentioned, the very reassuring thing about Sahaja Yoga is that nobody is ever taught to believe in anything

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:25.000
that is not object of experience and perception.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:38.000
I also mentioned that for those who saw desire, the verification of the hypothesis can take place at the end of this program.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:44.000
Now I should perhaps before ending tell you why it is so.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:52.000
Why it is that we who are very, I should say normal people,

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:57.000
why is it that we should be in a position to know this experience?

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.000
What have we done to deserve it?

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:09.000
I mean if I ask this question for myself, I'm a bit puzzled because I certainly did not at any point

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:15.000
have got the feeling that I had done anything to deserve that.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:26.000
So it came as such a surprise to me that I should get my realization that really for quite some time I would not quite believe that it is so.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:34.000
And I found out later on that many people have the same difficulty to relate to something which is so incredibly beyond our wildest dream

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.000
that it's just to go to be true.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.000
You know where is the catch? I mean it's not possible.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000
Well it is.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:47.000
And Shimataji is a very, which I welcome here, very gracious of you to have come.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000
We thank you so much.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.000
We certainly are very grateful to you for coming Shimataji.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:05.000
Shimataji is a very poetical, simple image which in my view is perfect because it carries the strength of simplicity and it says it all.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:15.000
Shimataji says that well if you have a tree which starts producing flowers in the middle of winter under snow and storm, this is a miracle.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:28.000
And that miracle where those great souls of the past which received their realization at a point where the whole evolutionary process was not quite mature for this.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000
And therefore that will struggle in an incredible way.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:36.000
And this is what you learn when you study the lives of such great people.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:43.000
Now if this same tree is blossoming in spring, it's not a miracle.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:48.000
It's nature's ways and rhythm.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.000
It is the dance of evolution.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000
It is the moment that should happen.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:22:04.000
And so Shimataji says we now have entered a time where this process of triggering our mass self-realization has come.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:15.000
And if you study arts, literature, anything, any parameter of modern civilization, you know that there is a tremendous expectation for this kind of breakthrough.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:27.000
And this is pretty obvious that today Englishmen for instance are not motivated by many things, certainly not by competing with Japanese in order to make gadgets.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:33.000
I mean the economic indicators prove that they don't devote much energy to these things.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:39.000
So what do they care about?

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:43.000
Cricket maybe but other things too.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:54.000
And actually I would submit that it is probably an evolutionary progress to accept that GNP should decrease because one does not bother about it.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.000
But then what should we devote our attention to?

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:07.000
And many people in this country as in any so-called industrial countries are trying to devote more energy to the pursuit of this inner truth.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:19.000
The only trouble is the setup that I have described before is that there is such a big show in town that people don't go into the right shop.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:26.000
Because first of all they assume it has to be found in a shop where you can buy it and this is the first mistake.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:35.000
So here you can't buy because it's too expensive.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.000
It's so expensive that it can only be given.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:44.000
Trimata Gissel realization is as important as breathing.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:51.000
If you would have to puncture your bank account in order to have the right to breathe you would be dead long time back.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:56.000
And it is the same thing.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:02.000
So it happens now because now the time has come and it happens for another reason.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:07.000
And this other reason if I may say so is sitting before you.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:22.000
Now speaking to I would say a few people who have never had exposure to Sahaja Yoga

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:27.000
I should certainly keep a kind of sobriety while introducing Trimata Gissel which is difficult.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:40.000
Because her achievements are so extraordinary that they are difficult to express in English which is a language appreciating understatements.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.000
It's very difficult to understate Trimata Gissel.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.000
I mean we are condemned to understate her anyway.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:56.000
But how to give some or end some justice to her labor.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:05.000
The work she has been doing in this country and I should say in the whole of Western Europe not to mention Australia and of course India.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:13.000
What I know is that she is a totally selfless, totally genuine person.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:21.000
Not only she didn't ever take any penny, I should blush for saying such nonsense from anybody.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:32.000
But the first lot of her followers in London were of such a kind of economically derelict soul that she had to pay for the rent of the flat for some time.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:39.000
So this is one of the oddities of Sahaja Yoga and there are many others that you will discover in due time.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:52.000
Trimata Gissel despite a tremendous power that we would not be able to face if that power would not be just love.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:26:06.000
Despite cities, despite qualities that in my humble view are to be found in nobody on this earth and I have seen a lot of so-called spiritual people before I met Trimata Gissel.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:17.000
Despite all this, she is extremely human. I mean much more than me, I am quite surprised about that.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:34.000
There is a word in Sanskrit for this and this word is called Mahamaya and Mahamaya means the Great Illusion.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:44.000
So you have the privilege to sit this evening in front of a very, very great illusion and this is the illusion that you are in front of a human being.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:56.000
It's a nice illusion though because if you would realize that it is not so, you may run away and this is not the purpose of the evening.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:14.000
So I suppose that I should end this few words by means of introduction.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:33.000
Thanking you very much for having come all the way from wherever you came and if Sahaja Yoga is full of joy, is full of humor, it's also a sacred reality.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:48.000
It is a sacred reality of our innermost divine being which opens itself if we in all humility and sincerity so wish.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:58.000
Trimata Gissel, I am again in the name of everybody most graceful that you should grace this evening.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:22.000
And it is my humblest prayer that everybody who has come should experience their Self-realization and what is even as important as that, should understand what great, great gift that evening is for them.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.000
Thank you very much.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:31.000
Let's read a flower.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:14.000
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:38.000
We had no intentions of having any public programs in England but somehow Mr. Gavin Brown hopes against hopes.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:30:05.000
And they spent lot of money for this program and I only feel sorry that every time they have a public program, we get very few people and even if you get last time we had about 300 people who were new, they got some of them did touch realization.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:11.000
They looked very serious but nothing inside.

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:27.000
We lost most of them because you see we have become used to our mental capacity to enact something and not to be the reality.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:37.000
It's a specialty of mental people that they talk too much, they say too much, have nothing with them.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:48.000
It's very shocking sometimes when you see how people say things about reality.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:59.000
I watch sometimes television, I see people on the television and I feel they are somewhere near reality, they are talking about reality.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:06.000
They understand that there's something missing in their lives and they are looking for it.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:24.000
But when it comes to actualization and to achieving what you have, whatever is your own, they become absolutely mundane, frivolous, very surprising.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:28.000
I can't understand why it should happen.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:39.000
Now supposing you say, as God has been giving me certificates, great certificates is given and also he is a diplomat.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:50.000
So diplomatically he was trying to please all of you so that you take to Sahaja Yoga because he doesn't want you to commit the same mistakes that most of them have committed.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:58.000
But despite all that, let us face ourselves clearly.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:07.000
Newcomers are absolutely a minority here so I'm talking also to Sahaja Yoga.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:10.000
Let us face ourselves fully.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.000
Are we ourselves?

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:31.000
We've got everything supposing we say, alright, we have seen the power of political achievement, of economic achievements, of other achievements which we call emotional achievements.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:35.000
But have we really faced ourselves?

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.000
Have we seen ourselves?

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.000
What is our quality of life?

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:46.000
I asked an Englishman, I said, what is the quality of an Englishman?

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:53.000
He said, it depends on how many times he goes for a sea resort, can you imagine?

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.000
What?

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:56.000
Sea resort.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:00.000
How many years back did you start going to the sea resort?

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.000
I don't think we never heard about it in India.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:10.000
It's about twenty-five years back somebody's stupid fellow must be or somebody very clever maybe.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:17.000
Put this idea that we all should go to the sea resort because we must get our skin full of cancer.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:35.000
So the quality of a person doesn't depend on a mental acceptance of something that looks new.

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:45.000
And that's what is happening to all of us is anything new that comes, we accept it and we think we have a quality.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:53.000
If a lady goes supposing to a sea resort, because I meet other kind also who are not seekers at all,

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:58.000
she'll come and tell and say, now see what a tan I have.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:05.000
I mean it's so superficial, it's so frivolous, it's so nonsensical.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:11.000
I mean is this the value of your life?

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:18.000
You have come out of amoeba stage to this stage and what are you doing about yourself?

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:27.000
Making it tan, that sometimes really makes me feel very disappointed.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:32.000
And this is such a common topic all over.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:35.000
What are we?

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:39.000
We are human beings.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:46.000
We have come out of amoeba to other stage and other stage in thousands of years.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:52.000
Today we are human beings.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:56.000
Made to achieve something great.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:08.000
Nature has worked on us relentlessly, so beautifully, so delicately, so lovingly for what?

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:19.000
And when we just become mental according to Indian philosophers, a mental person is nothing but a stupid fellow.

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:26.000
Egoistical person he becomes and he becomes nothing but a stupid fellow.

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:36.000
Because anything that comes of the mental expression, today I was only watching about the modern art.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:45.000
Modern art is alright if you know how to become super modern, that is a realized soul.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:58.000
But this modern art was described by a gentleman and then ultimately got into the real mood of saying something that is the truth.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:10.000
He said that this all expression shows that we were barbaric and now we have become worse than barbaric.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:21.000
So the whole expression of our life is something that we have done out of our mental thing.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:26.000
We are so much in imbalance.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:46.000
Now the main thing one has to understand that you are made a human being by the kindness, the grace of the nature of God Almighty as I call it.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:54.000
Not by you, not by mental thought.

00:36:54.000 --> 00:37:14.000
You have a special value, you have a very, very special value in the eyes of the nature, in the working of the evolutionary process.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:27.000
Have we got any concept as to what is expected out of us?

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:40.000
Are we to waste our life into these frivolous, stupid things doing everything very seriously though?

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:47.000
They are very serious about all stupidity, especially when they talk for a greater stupidity they are more serious.

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:52.000
They think without that there won't be any impression on people.

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:58.000
But the main thing is we have missed the point.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:04.000
The point is you have to be the spirit.

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:07.000
All these doings are to be the spirit.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:13.000
It's not talking, it's not your mental projections, all your new ideas coming up and going up.

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:18.000
It's not that, it is you have to be the spirit.

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:25.000
Face it out.

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:30.000
This you cannot purchase in the market, you cannot.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:32.000
You cannot put in any effort.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:36.000
Now you are that, just to become that.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.000
That's what your quality is.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:46.000
That's what I see you as.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:50.000
Or anybody who is a realized soul.

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:56.000
But what do you see yourself as is the main point.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:06.000
That's why there cannot be much report.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:09.000
Anything new that is brought to you.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:12.000
Oh, it's nice.

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:15.000
How, how do you know?

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:23.000
Traditions we have put on one side because tradition means all conditioning, all wrong things, tradition we don't want.

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:25.000
All right.

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:28.000
So now what are you clinging to?

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:31.000
At least tradition had one safe point.

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:35.000
That trial and error you have found out something sensible.

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:37.000
Now you put tradition all nonsense.

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:39.000
Why?

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:44.000
Because you cannot take out the good out of that tradition.

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:49.000
So now you are going to the other side saying all right, no tradition.

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:51.000
We got this new style.

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:55.000
We don't want to be covered by any tradition.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:10.000
Like people might say what is in a painting of say Marlowe whom I like very much to say.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:11.000
What is so great?

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:13.000
We can do some drip painting.

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:15.000
They have drip painting.

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:18.000
I don't know what sort of paintings they have these days.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:24.000
Why should we, you can't do even one painting like that.

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:27.000
You can't even reproduce.

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:30.000
You cannot think of such a painting.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:32.000
Face it.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:38.000
Modern mind is incapable of conceiving that.

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:40.000
Accept it.

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:42.000
You have gone down in quality.

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.000
Why?

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:50.000
Because of mental movement.

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:53.000
It's such a limited movement.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:41:02.000
But those people believed in something higher, higher, higher ideals.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:10.000
They thought of God, they thought of perfecting themselves.

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:13.000
Not putting the chaos in your heart outside.

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:21.000
But you are perfecting, resting in that, believing in that, in that peaceful atmosphere.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:25.000
They created something that you cannot produce.

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:29.000
Only thing what you can do, I don't like it.

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:34.000
Like in my house, I was screen made in Saranpur long time back.

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:35.000
It's beautifully done.

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:40.000
It has got beautiful honeycomb work which no one can do.

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.000
I want some people to come to see.

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:44.000
I don't like it.

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:52.000
I said, can you make even three inches of that?

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:56.000
That's the only thing you can do, is to say, I don't like it, finished.

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:59.000
Can you do three inches?

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:01.000
Can you?

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:03.000
You can't.

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:05.000
Accept this fact.

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:13.000
Once you accept this fact, I'm sure the humility that is needed will come into you.

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:15.000
Humility is lacking.

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:21.000
Seekers must have humility, otherwise they will go to people who will pamper their egos

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:26.000
and they will be drifted into nonsensical till their money is finished, till they become

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:29.000
absolutely lunatics or epileptics.

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:34.000
They will just continue and will finish off.

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:44.000
But to be sensible, to be sane, one has to understand that our worth is much more than

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:45.000
this.

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:50.000
Like a BBC Fellow comes and tells me, I mean he thinks he's praising you, I don't know

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:57.000
whatever you may call it, that an Anglo-Saxon brain cannot understand anything spiritual

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:00.000
for which you don't have to pay.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:07.000
I really tell you he said it to me and I refuse to go on that BBC because I said first of

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:11.000
all your Anglo-Saxon brain must be alright.

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:14.000
Is it a special brain you have made, Anglo-Saxon brains?

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:21.000
Are they specially made by God?

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:28.000
When you say you are Anglo-Saxon brain, you have absolutely put down your value, down.

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:38.000
And when you say it's a human brain, then you are great because you become one of that

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:41.000
rich world.

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.000
There's no global sense.

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:47.000
We don't have a global sense at all within ourselves.

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:57.000
Whatever we have is so localized and insular understanding.

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:02.000
So insular that we just say I don't like it, I don't want it.

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:10.000
Who is this I?

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:14.000
It's only possible when we come to some humility.

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:21.000
With all respect to England, because England to me is very great and it's the heart of

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:22.000
the universe.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:27.000
And when I say this in the European countries they get rather upset, mother, what England

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:28.000
is the heart?

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:32.000
That's too much mother, we can't digest this.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:35.000
It is the heart, whatever you like it or not.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:43.000
It is the heart, no doubt.

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:57.500
But water heart and break it, you know, cannot make it expand.

00:44:57.500 --> 00:45:06.480
This is the sad part of English is, is the heart is a very important organ of the universe.

00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:18.320
It's the cells that exist here who are supposed to circulate in the whole world, who have

00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:29.160
to achieve so many things as the cells of the heart achieve by pumping out new refreshed

00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:36.080
blood.

00:45:36.080 --> 00:45:41.640
It's expected to have beautiful heart and English mind.

00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:49.560
A heart that is to be cherished, to be enjoyed and appreciated.

00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:56.720
Where are they?

00:45:56.720 --> 00:46:03.360
With all this expenditure on these people here, previously I used to do it in England

00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:09.480
but I gave up, exhausted all my bank and how many disciples I get are seven for four

00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:16.200
years I said give up these people, good for nothing, useless.

00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:23.800
All the money they spend, what do you find, what's the quality, how many come up and how

00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:29.600
many work it out, how many care for their self-realization.

00:46:29.600 --> 00:46:43.320
For me to say that I work very hard I don't think I work at all, I don't work.

00:46:43.320 --> 00:46:47.480
I do not work, it emits.

00:46:47.480 --> 00:46:51.360
It's there.

00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:53.080
But it's a waste.

00:46:53.080 --> 00:47:03.000
It's a waste land.

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:09.640
How are we going to sow the seed in the waste land?

00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:12.600
How are we going to work it out?

00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:20.880
Especially London seems to be a rock, rock of Gibraltar has come in London I think.

00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:26.680
For this place to Wimbledon you'll be surprised, we are very fond of tennis so both of us used

00:47:26.680 --> 00:47:33.360
to come and our driver would say we must go one hour earlier.

00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:34.360
Why?

00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:41.880
You just can't get in there and we used to come one hour earlier to get into the lanes

00:47:41.880 --> 00:47:48.600
of this Wimbledon to go and see the tennis.

00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:52.760
And the same Wimbledon has twenty people, new people over here.

00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:59.680
I really wanted to go back because I felt what sort of a quality is this that I'm wasting

00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:02.240
my time with.

00:48:02.240 --> 00:48:09.400
We tried everything, diplomatic relationship, food we invited them, gave them food, tea,

00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:14.080
Indian tea, all kinds of things we tried.

00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:16.320
That a mother should try her level best.

00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:23.600
But you don't understand this.

00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:28.680
Of course the Indians who are here are all uprooted people, I don't call them Indians

00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:31.560
at all, most of them.

00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:34.040
They are just uprooted people.

00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:39.680
They don't understand the value of their life, no, most of them.

00:48:39.680 --> 00:48:45.800
Of course there are some sensible people also, no doubt, but very few.

00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:47.920
You know what are we to do?

00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:53.280
Supposing there is something great that has to happen to this world and that you are the

00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:55.640
ones who have to be blessed.

00:48:55.640 --> 00:49:05.560
You can believe it, I've been here for twelve years now, this will be the twelfth year.

00:49:05.560 --> 00:49:13.160
But there's a guru who wants a Rolls Royce, he's already got fifty-eight, he wants fifty-ninth.

00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:24.200
There are sixty-thousand people here who are buying a Rolls Royce for that person.

00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:30.440
What happens to your brains, I can't understand.

00:49:30.440 --> 00:49:32.480
Is that the spirit?

00:49:32.480 --> 00:49:35.720
Is that what you are seeking?

00:49:35.720 --> 00:49:43.520
Under statement I understand, but under valuing I don't understand.

00:49:43.520 --> 00:50:00.400
No value for your own being, not for your own evolution and for your own personality.

00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:05.360
I tell you I've done everything under the sun in this country.

00:50:05.360 --> 00:50:10.520
I need to have hardly worked for two years and we have thousands and thousands of people

00:50:10.520 --> 00:50:12.920
who are Sahaja Yogis today there.

00:50:12.920 --> 00:50:17.040
Our country is going to change very fast, I know that.

00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:23.840
It will work out even in so many other countries.

00:50:23.840 --> 00:50:35.120
But England, William Blake, I don't know, he dreamt so great about England because he

00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:38.360
knew the quality of England, that Jerusalem.

00:50:38.360 --> 00:50:48.600
Do you think you still hope what he said?

00:50:48.600 --> 00:50:57.040
You have such an advantage of your language, you have such an advantage that you can read

00:50:57.040 --> 00:50:59.360
about so many things.

00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:04.440
Most of the books of philosophy are translated into your language.

00:51:04.440 --> 00:51:11.960
They are specially being blessed by so much of knowledge.

00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:24.880
Despite that, why, why people are so much unaware of their worth, of their deserving

00:51:24.880 --> 00:51:27.880
capacity.

00:51:27.880 --> 00:51:30.600
What do they deserve?

00:51:30.600 --> 00:51:41.720
Can see is the expectation of the disasters that are going to come or horrible things

00:51:41.720 --> 00:51:44.120
that are going to happen in this world.

00:51:44.120 --> 00:51:51.960
All these things do we deserve or do we deserve some sort of a great hope for ourselves.

00:51:51.960 --> 00:51:54.720
And everything is within you, you can see that.

00:51:54.720 --> 00:51:55.720
It's all there.

00:51:55.720 --> 00:51:57.560
It's your own.

00:51:57.560 --> 00:52:01.840
Why shouldn't you have it?

00:52:01.840 --> 00:52:08.640
I mean we have tried everything to push you down to that point, every way, every method.

00:52:08.640 --> 00:52:14.280
As in Sanskrit they say, Kamadhamadandabhedaniti, everything, five things we have tried to

00:52:14.280 --> 00:52:16.240
work it out.

00:52:16.240 --> 00:52:23.200
So now only another thing is to push people with piston up there and keep them waiting.

00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:32.200
But also perhaps you've done, isn't it?

00:52:32.200 --> 00:52:38.840
The whole world is looking at you.

00:52:38.840 --> 00:52:41.640
Remember that.

00:52:41.640 --> 00:52:49.760
Not big talking, not big saying, but the big thing happening within you is actualization

00:52:49.760 --> 00:52:56.560
of that great thing which is so simple, so beautiful.

00:52:56.560 --> 00:53:05.440
It takes hardly anything for you to become your spirit, but to maintain it, to respect

00:53:05.440 --> 00:53:07.440
it and to be there.

00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:11.560
I don't know what sort of a special glue we should have.

00:53:11.560 --> 00:53:13.440
They just don't stick on.

00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:17.560
They meet me on the shop, Mother, I said, how?

00:53:17.920 --> 00:53:18.920
Oh, you don't know.

00:53:18.920 --> 00:53:22.320
I came to it twelve years back, you gave me realization, all right, now what are you

00:53:22.320 --> 00:53:23.320
doing about it?

00:53:23.320 --> 00:53:27.200
Mother, I lost it, you know.

00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:28.200
Really.

00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:37.040
It's very common, very common phenomena.

00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:46.720
So those who are here today, twenty people, I hope are special and they consider this

00:53:46.720 --> 00:54:01.600
experience as something special and establish themselves as great saints, knowing everything

00:54:01.600 --> 00:54:06.480
about their own powers.

00:54:06.480 --> 00:54:15.440
It's all has to be free, you cannot pay for it.

00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:19.240
I'm really frustrated, I'm muscly.

00:54:19.240 --> 00:54:25.560
I was going away this time to India, I would have been there.

00:54:25.560 --> 00:54:31.440
But as you say, one is more concerned about the lost lambs.

00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:35.000
India is very easy.

00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:36.920
So I've stuck back.

00:54:36.920 --> 00:54:40.000
I hope you are not going to disappoint me.

00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:43.320
Those who have come for the first time, please.

00:54:43.320 --> 00:54:46.560
Gregor has ties his tricks.

00:54:46.560 --> 00:54:52.640
Everybody tries, but I don't know how to make people stick.

00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:58.200
A surprising, in the West, people have developed the best quality glues.

00:54:58.200 --> 00:55:04.040
We cannot develop such in India or any developing countries, don't have glues.

00:55:04.040 --> 00:55:11.800
But as far as they are concerned, they cannot stick on to anything whatsoever.

00:55:11.800 --> 00:55:14.800
They cannot stick on to their wives, they cannot stick on to their husbands, they cannot

00:55:14.800 --> 00:55:19.040
stick on to their houses, they cannot stick on to anything whatsoever.

00:55:19.040 --> 00:55:26.360
Whatever has to grow has to stick on somewhere.

00:55:26.360 --> 00:55:32.600
If you have to make a well, then you find some water, then you dig it down, then you dig

00:55:32.600 --> 00:55:36.360
one, then another, then another, then go about.

00:55:36.360 --> 00:55:40.400
That's not the way.

00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:45.720
There has to be that breaking into that depth that you are.

00:55:45.720 --> 00:55:54.760
There has to be that happening where you break into your own depth, your own quality, your

00:55:54.760 --> 00:55:57.040
own wealth.

00:55:57.040 --> 00:56:00.840
But that time you don't give.

00:56:00.840 --> 00:56:02.080
You don't give to yourself.

00:56:02.080 --> 00:56:04.280
You have no time for yourself.

00:56:04.280 --> 00:56:07.040
You have time for all kinds of nonsensical things.

00:56:07.040 --> 00:56:21.440
But no time for yourself to see what beauty lies, what glory lies behind this body, above

00:56:21.440 --> 00:56:34.200
this mind and below these emotions.

00:56:34.200 --> 00:56:40.040
I do not know any other method is possible now.

00:56:40.040 --> 00:56:42.280
I must say I give up.

00:56:42.280 --> 00:56:47.000
I've tried everything.

00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:51.520
And as you have heard about Sahaja Yoga, it's a fact.

00:56:51.520 --> 00:56:53.840
There's no doubt about it.

00:56:53.840 --> 00:56:55.840
There's nothing to lose.

00:56:55.840 --> 00:56:57.640
You are the Spirit.

00:56:57.640 --> 00:57:00.720
You have to become the Spirit.

00:57:00.720 --> 00:57:06.600
It must relate to the traditional expression of your revolution.

00:57:06.600 --> 00:57:14.640
It cannot cut out all the saints, all the great prophets, all the great religious leaders.

00:57:14.640 --> 00:57:16.800
It cannot cut out.

00:57:16.800 --> 00:57:24.280
But it integrates all the essences of these great admins who came on this earth to guide

00:57:24.280 --> 00:57:25.280
us.

00:57:25.760 --> 00:57:30.880
It does not cut out anywhere.

00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:34.920
And that's what is Sahaja Yoga.

00:57:34.920 --> 00:57:38.280
Sahaja as you know it was spontaneous.

00:57:38.280 --> 00:57:46.120
Now spontaneous can be quite misrepresented if you use through your brains.

00:57:46.120 --> 00:57:52.120
Spontaneous means it's a living process that should happen to all of you and don't miss

00:57:52.120 --> 00:57:54.800
the point.

00:57:54.800 --> 00:58:07.920
You have to spend at least a month to see the light that you have got is to be carried

00:58:07.920 --> 00:58:10.160
much deeper into you.

00:58:10.160 --> 00:58:11.800
You are deep.

00:58:11.800 --> 00:58:13.840
You are great.

00:58:13.840 --> 00:58:20.320
But if you have to find the pearls that are hidden, you have to go deep down.

00:58:21.040 --> 00:58:28.400
It's very simple because the more you go deeper into yourself, the more you enjoy,

00:58:28.400 --> 00:58:38.280
the more you become a wholesome personality, a greater personality, a personality that

00:58:38.280 --> 00:58:49.960
sees everything on a universal level and understand everything that is global.

00:58:49.960 --> 00:59:05.600
I'm sorry today I am not in my real proper mood I should say because I know how much

00:59:05.600 --> 00:59:07.480
these people have done.

00:59:07.480 --> 00:59:14.120
They have advertised, have gone round, they have put up advertisements everywhere, put

00:59:14.120 --> 00:59:18.080
up so much money and that what time, standard times or what?

00:59:18.080 --> 00:59:19.080
What was this?

00:59:19.080 --> 00:59:28.000
Oh God and that times also times take so much money out of your pockets.

00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:30.000
Just think of it.

00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:34.640
They are like gurus you see.

00:59:34.640 --> 00:59:45.600
All that to spend and what do you get out of it one feels so sad, it's very sad.

00:59:45.600 --> 00:59:51.320
Of course America is so much worse that relatively you don't feel that sad when you think of

00:59:51.320 --> 00:59:54.040
America.

00:59:54.040 --> 01:00:09.360
But after describing all the American art today the gentleman came to the conclusion and

01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:17.280
he said that after seeing all this art one reaches a conclusion to say that they were

01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:21.320
barbarians and now they become worst barbarians.

01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:28.160
Oh God I said what am I to do with these Americans now?

01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:31.880
But to me you are all my children, you are all mine.

01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:34.480
I cannot allow you to be drifted away.

01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:37.840
Till the last I'll try to work out.

01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:46.280
I know I feel sometimes very desperate and sad.

01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:47.680
English have very much changed now.

01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:51.040
They are so much influenced by the French.

01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:57.360
Now the French are better but they are influenced by the old French and the old Americans, not

01:00:57.360 --> 01:00:58.360
the new ones.

01:00:58.360 --> 01:01:02.720
New ones are very alert.

01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:11.360
So all the old ideas of these nonsensical writers are lingering now in England deposited

01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:19.240
like in a case of anjaina in the heart, you see, when there is hardening of the arteries

01:01:19.240 --> 01:01:27.880
all the bad blood stagnates like that it's happening I feel.

01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:29.600
They have given up these ideas.

01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:30.600
They have rid of it.

01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:32.720
They don't want to have it.

01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:38.320
We are still continuing with them.

01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:42.920
Something respectable for ourselves.

01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:46.320
That's what I feel.

01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:50.920
Today being most of them Sahaja Yogis here I'm sure you'll all get your realization

01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:51.920
in no time.

01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:53.920
I'm sure of that.

01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:58.640
But that's not sufficient.

01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:03.800
Out of the three hundred we got in Hampstead with all the work these people did advertising,

01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:13.880
these, that, whatever was possible, five peoples some are the stuck on and only three I think

01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:19.040
with a great glue came down.

01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:21.400
That should not happen again.

01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:26.040
So specially for the new people I have to tell you that this is something so important

01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:30.480
that has come to be important.

01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:36.160
All these tennis players I've seen them coming and going.

01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:41.120
One comes this year, next year he goes away, somebody is today a top seat then he goes

01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:44.640
down, not in Sahaja Yoga.

01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:50.520
You ascend and ascend and ascend and ascend eternally.

01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:57.440
It's a very different style of tennis.

01:02:57.440 --> 01:03:04.280
It's a real playing.

01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:06.120
It's no profession as I needed.

01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:11.840
You become such tremendous players.

01:03:11.840 --> 01:03:16.120
Such a game you develop.

01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:25.920
And that's what is there for you just to jump into it and to understand the swimming.

01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:28.160
And I'm sure it will work out.

01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:38.000
I hope all those who have come for the first time will not treat themselves frivolously

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:45.960
but will stand up to it and give us some encouragement to work out more in England.

01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:54.080
Otherwise maybe tomorrow all the Sahaja Yogis from here may come to India with their, what

01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:56.800
to say, stock, what?

01:03:56.800 --> 01:04:00.000
Stock, lock, lock, stock and barrel.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:01.600
Lock, stock and barrel.

01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:04.200
Of course without the barrels.

01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:10.880
Now let's see now how it works out.

01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:12.920
There's nothing serious about it.

01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:17.000
You have to be very pleasantly placed towards yourself.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:18.640
This is one thing you should do.

01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:29.320
A person who is godly is never serious inside.

01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:33.400
He's playing the game.

01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:38.600
So in that playful mood of a Mulder, let us see what happens.

01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:41.600
May God bless you.

01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:44.600
Any questions?

01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:47.600
I'll have some water.

01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:49.600
Some water, please.

01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:51.600
Thank you.

01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:16.600
No questions.

01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:20.600
That seems to be good.

01:05:20.600 --> 01:05:25.600
You are free to ask questions.

01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:34.600
If you have to achieve complete freedom, your freedom is to be respected.

01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:37.600
Your freedom has to be respected.

01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:41.600
That's one question.

01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:43.600
Yes?

01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:48.600
I'm a Christian and I do meditation.

01:05:48.600 --> 01:05:55.600
So I still find welcome to do the meditation.

01:05:55.600 --> 01:06:00.600
He's a Christian, he does meditation, he wonders whether he's welcome to our yoga.

01:06:00.600 --> 01:06:02.600
Very much.

01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:06.600
But if you are a Christian, please be seated.

01:06:06.600 --> 01:06:08.600
Please be seated.

01:06:08.600 --> 01:06:11.600
Christian is alright, any religion is alright.

01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:13.600
It's all great.

01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:16.600
But it has talked of the future.

01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:30.600
Christ has said, I will send you a comforter, counselor and a redeemer.

01:06:30.600 --> 01:06:34.600
Why not the Christians look for someone like that?

01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:37.600
Christ is gone now, He's not here.

01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:43.600
Why don't they look out for a Holy Ghost?

01:06:56.600 --> 01:06:59.600
He himself has said it.

01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:05.600
Moments have said that during the time of resurrection, your hands will speak.

01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:13.600
What about the Muslims?

01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:21.600
Why don't they look out for the resurrection?

01:07:21.600 --> 01:07:26.600
Third is Guru Nanak, Kabira.

01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:41.600
Nanak was so great that he combined all the realized souls who were poets and made a big, beautiful ransa.

01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:43.600
What are the six doing?

01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:48.600
They're just reading it, reading it.

01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:56.600
He says, without knowing yourself, you will be an illusion.

01:07:56.600 --> 01:08:00.600
He said very clearly.

01:08:00.600 --> 01:08:03.600
Then should we not look for that?

01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:05.600
But what happens?

01:08:05.600 --> 01:08:07.600
I tell you, what's the mistake is?

01:08:07.600 --> 01:08:13.600
Once a religion is organized, it neutralizes all your ascent.

01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:19.600
Organized.

01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:26.600
I also took my birth in the Christian religion, so-called, I would say.

01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:34.600
Especially that too Protestant for particular reasons.

01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:42.600
I could have taken birth anywhere else, but now.

01:08:42.600 --> 01:08:48.600
And there is no talk of ascent, no talk of second birth.

01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:55.600
Artificially somebody puts his hand on your head, now you are a Christian.

01:08:55.600 --> 01:08:58.600
I don't know how you become.

01:08:58.600 --> 01:09:02.600
Same about Hindus, same about every one of them.

01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:07.600
They are leading an artificial religion.

01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:10.600
It's a garb.

01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:12.600
Reality is within.

01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:18.600
Whatever these people have worked and said is not done by them.

01:09:18.600 --> 01:09:23.600
It's become a superficial thing.

01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:30.600
You will not be happy and listen until you find your spirit.

01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:32.600
How can you organize religion?

01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:39.600
How can you organize God?

01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:47.600
Then you think you belong to a church, you belong to a, what you call that, a sect,

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:49.600
or what is it called?

01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:51.600
Another thing, something.

01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:52.600
Denomination.

01:09:52.600 --> 01:09:54.600
Denomination.

01:09:54.600 --> 01:09:59.600
All these denominations brand us.

01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:03.600
What's the thing for me, all of them are just the same?

01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:16.600
Still groping in the dark, how many are seeking reality?

01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:26.600
It's not that Christianity has failed, it is the church that has failed.

01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:34.600
Christ can never fail, nor can Guru Nanak.

01:10:34.600 --> 01:10:38.600
Nor can Mohammad Sahab.

01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:42.600
What fails is our understanding of them.

01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:45.600
Let us be the spirit and then we'll understand them.

01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:49.600
They are all one, hand in hand.

01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:51.600
No difference at all.

01:10:51.600 --> 01:11:00.600
They are all one, believe me.

01:11:00.600 --> 01:11:07.600
You don't have to give up anything, you have to just see to the essence of it.

01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:16.600
Supposing a leaf is sick, you cannot treat it at the leaf end, you have to go to the roots.

01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:20.600
And when you go to the roots you find you have not given up any leaf.

01:11:20.600 --> 01:11:25.600
You are at the roots and you are at the leaf also everywhere you exist.

01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:31.600
There are so many seekers lost in this kind of denomination.

01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:36.600
So many of them.

01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:41.600
Thank God my parents were realized souls, thank God.

01:11:41.600 --> 01:11:49.600
Because I found protestants were the different type of fanatics, you see, very sophisticated.

01:11:49.600 --> 01:11:54.600
You would never find out that they are fanatics, so sophisticated, you know.

01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:59.600
If you make anything very sophisticated you can't find it out.

01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:06.600
We can call everybody else a fanatic but a protestant you can never call because they are a mental people.

01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:11.600
They have made it very sophisticated.

01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:21.600
So if you become so very sophisticated that you cannot see yourself and you cannot make it out

01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:34.600
that it's I who is following some sort of a fanaticism, an ideology, a mental projection, how can you get out of it?

01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:42.600
From every religion people will think, oh Baba this is fanaticism, this is too much.

01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:55.600
But for this I may be the first and I hope I am not the last.

01:12:55.600 --> 01:12:59.600
Martin Luther himself was a realized soul, no doubt.

01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:13.600
But at that time, in that short time with all kinds of operations and pressures, how far could he go?

01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:24.600
And then there's already an attack built in with Paul and then with Augustine.

01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:27.600
What can you do?

01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:40.600
Any realized soul like Khalil Jumran could see it clearly.

01:13:40.600 --> 01:13:48.600
So we have to know one thing, we have to love the truth.

01:13:48.600 --> 01:14:01.600
Truth is to be discovered through your spirit and love your truth and not untruth.

01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:08.600
Any denomination is untruth.

01:14:08.600 --> 01:14:11.600
What is the truth?

01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:16.600
Is the essence of that.

01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:19.600
Everything is becoming a plastic.

01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:26.600
And then we say why people are living churches, why people are running up from Christian faith or from that faith?

01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:28.600
Nothing wrong with Christ, I know.

01:14:28.600 --> 01:14:43.600
No, it's wrong with us that we have made all these plastic things to cover his image.

01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:52.600
The greatest justice you can do to Christ is to get your realization.

01:14:52.600 --> 01:14:58.600
He was crucified for that.

01:14:58.600 --> 01:15:02.600
He came for that and he waits for that.

01:15:02.600 --> 01:15:12.600
So please get your realization first and then you will know what is Christ and how great he is.

01:15:12.600 --> 01:15:17.600
May God bless you.

01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:19.600
What else is there?

01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:20.600
Any other question?

01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:25.600
It's a good question because that problem faces everyone of you.

01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:31.600
Let's see.

01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:40.600
Or there could be denominations like Communists, Capitalists, East Fist, all sorts of things.

01:15:40.600 --> 01:15:45.600
There could be, any time.

01:15:45.600 --> 01:15:51.600
I don't know the latest.

01:15:51.600 --> 01:16:01.600
I think lost counts after anti-cultures.

01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:11.600
There's only one denomination of God is a realized soul, a yogi, one with God.

01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:13.600
That's the only one.

01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:19.600
There's no other denomination where all of them combine.

01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:36.600
Christ, Muhammad, Lao Tse, Socrates, Krishna, Rama, Nanaka, Kabirah, all of them combine

01:16:36.600 --> 01:16:45.600
in that great family of divinity.

01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:46.600
All right.

01:16:46.600 --> 01:16:49.600
So should we have realization?

01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:56.600
I mean most of you have had.

01:16:56.600 --> 01:16:57.600
Is there any question?

01:16:57.600 --> 01:16:58.600
You can ask.

01:16:58.600 --> 01:17:07.600
I'll be very happy.

01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:14.600
Was he?

01:17:14.600 --> 01:17:26.600
No, this is the problem is you cannot call yourself.

01:17:26.600 --> 01:17:28.600
This is a very big problem.

01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:34.600
You see when I went to America, I must tell you, when I started talking about it, they

01:17:34.600 --> 01:17:36.600
said, you must, what do you say that?

01:17:36.600 --> 01:17:41.600
Make it a registration of my speeches?

01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:42.600
What is it called?

01:17:42.600 --> 01:17:43.600
Copyright.

01:17:43.600 --> 01:17:46.600
I must have a copyright, you see.

01:17:46.600 --> 01:17:50.600
Of course I'm very bad at the human laws.

01:17:50.600 --> 01:17:52.600
So I said, all right, now what is that for?

01:17:52.600 --> 01:17:54.600
He said they will try to copy you.

01:17:54.600 --> 01:17:57.600
I said, let them copy, it's very good.

01:17:57.600 --> 01:18:02.600
I mean I'll be very happy.

01:18:02.600 --> 01:18:04.600
So they must have a copyright.

01:18:04.600 --> 01:18:07.600
Now I said then what will they do?

01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:13.600
They said, you see they will use your words, your center as a very good idea.

01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:15.600
But you know what they did?

01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:20.600
They started calling themselves born again.

01:18:20.600 --> 01:18:22.600
Born again.

01:18:22.600 --> 01:18:24.600
You cannot call yourself anything.

01:18:24.600 --> 01:18:27.600
You see, it's a power, it's a state.

01:18:27.600 --> 01:18:29.600
It's a situation in which you have to be.

01:18:29.600 --> 01:18:34.600
If you are just born again, you say yourself, what is your power?

01:18:34.600 --> 01:18:40.600
Born again, the first power you get is that you become, your nerves become, your brain

01:18:40.600 --> 01:18:49.600
becomes collectively conscious in your awareness.

01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:55.600
That's the minimum that should happen to you.

01:18:55.600 --> 01:19:01.600
It's not certificate, it's another, oh I, that is the latest than the anti-cultures?

01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:04.600
Then they might be the latest.

01:19:04.600 --> 01:19:11.600
Is another denomination?

01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:13.600
There's no reality in that.

01:19:13.600 --> 01:19:18.600
You don't know one of the, one of the, they attacked me in Switzerland.

01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:25.600
And the lady born again was wearing all kinds of glittery things and she was bringing a Bible

01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:30.600
to hit me, you know, and I couldn't bear the whole joke.

01:19:30.600 --> 01:19:35.600
And I started laughing and everybody was very upset, but I was just laughing and said,

01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:38.600
what a nice thing born again coming up to hit me.

01:19:38.600 --> 01:19:43.600
What wrong am I doing to you?

01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:51.600
But you see, the thing is the organized religion is such a position, is such a security for people

01:19:51.600 --> 01:19:59.600
that they say, oh we are born again, now certified, certified.

01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:03.600
And they feel very secured with it I think, otherwise I can't understand why should you

01:20:03.600 --> 01:20:07.600
accept such a title, you are born again.

01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:14.600
Unless and until you have the power, you must know what is the power one should have as a born again.

01:20:14.600 --> 01:20:17.600
They have no knowledge, nothing.

01:20:17.600 --> 01:20:25.600
They just know Bible, which also is so superficial.

01:20:25.600 --> 01:20:29.600
There is no depth in their life, nothing.

01:20:29.600 --> 01:20:35.600
Self certification.

01:20:35.600 --> 01:20:41.600
There's no certificate in search.

01:20:41.600 --> 01:20:47.600
If you are born again, you will know yourself and then you have to become.

01:20:47.600 --> 01:20:51.600
It's a becoming that is important.

01:20:51.600 --> 01:20:55.600
That's a fact.

01:20:55.600 --> 01:20:58.600
Be careful about born increases.

01:20:58.600 --> 01:21:01.600
Oh, we have had enough of them.

01:21:01.600 --> 01:21:07.600
They felt quite challenged about Sahaja Yoga because everywhere we went they attacked us, everywhere.

01:21:07.600 --> 01:21:13.600
They tried to attack us, but when we went to Australia, the Australians said, now you have done enough of yours.

01:21:13.600 --> 01:21:17.600
We have got anything from you, better go away.

01:21:17.600 --> 01:21:19.600
So then they went away.

01:21:19.600 --> 01:21:22.600
They know self-deceived also, they live with self-deception.

01:21:22.600 --> 01:21:29.600
They know they haven't got anything.

01:21:29.600 --> 01:21:34.600
What have you got?

01:21:34.600 --> 01:21:40.600
All right, now Gregor has said, I am this, I am that, all right, don't believe in him.

01:21:40.600 --> 01:21:51.600
You must get something out of me.

01:21:51.600 --> 01:21:55.600
Another question.

01:21:55.600 --> 01:22:05.600
Could you explain the difference between self-realization and non-realization?

01:22:05.600 --> 01:22:06.600
Is that a Pajami?

01:22:06.600 --> 01:22:07.600
Yes.

01:22:07.600 --> 01:22:09.600
Ah!

01:22:09.600 --> 01:22:20.600
Just now let us deal with self-realization.

01:22:20.600 --> 01:22:27.600
That's why Buddha wanted not to speak a word about God, he never wanted to take the name of God also.

01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:38.600
He said, first self, he said, don't talk of God, dangerous situation.

01:22:38.600 --> 01:22:47.600
But in Sahaja Yoga, this thing I'll tell you, not here because people won't understand when I tell them about jacras.

01:22:47.600 --> 01:22:57.600
Better is to keep this for future, all right?

01:22:57.600 --> 01:23:14.600
Look at the Sahaja Yogis, now they want to have God's realization, that's good.

01:23:14.600 --> 01:23:24.600
What is the purpose of our soul in the material form?

01:23:24.600 --> 01:23:26.600
Oh!

01:23:26.600 --> 01:23:33.600
It's a long story.

01:23:33.600 --> 01:23:44.600
Human beings created the purpose in a way like a diamond lost in the mire.

01:23:44.600 --> 01:23:50.600
We can say Adam and Eve, it started.

01:23:50.600 --> 01:23:56.600
There would have been no need to go through all this.

01:23:56.600 --> 01:24:01.600
But human beings wanted to know everything.

01:24:01.600 --> 01:24:12.600
They wanted to know the sting of a scorpion, they wanted to know the bite of a snake and then they wanted to come to God.

01:24:12.600 --> 01:24:15.600
All right, you have your own way, you have freedom.

01:24:15.600 --> 01:24:18.600
That's freedom, nobody can take away.

01:24:18.600 --> 01:24:21.600
That's given to you, do what you like.

01:24:21.600 --> 01:24:27.600
So instead of eating your food directly like this, as I say, they started eating.

01:24:27.600 --> 01:24:32.600
What can you do?

01:24:32.600 --> 01:24:37.600
That's the human doing, not of God.

01:24:37.600 --> 01:24:46.600
It could have been very short circuited but it was so, all right.

01:24:46.600 --> 01:24:51.600
But that doesn't mean that your body is not required.

01:24:51.600 --> 01:25:00.600
Everything is required very much because the process is such.

01:25:00.600 --> 01:25:10.600
Supposing if you have a chance of making a fruit, a seed into a fruit, just in the laboratory, put the seed and it becomes a fruit.

01:25:10.600 --> 01:25:12.600
All right, then you don't have the whole process.

01:25:12.600 --> 01:25:20.600
But if the process is this way, better have it.

01:25:20.600 --> 01:25:25.600
Next, next time one can try that.

01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:28.600
But let's finish the process now.

01:25:28.600 --> 01:25:30.600
We're coming to the end of it.

01:25:30.600 --> 01:25:34.600
There's a trouble now, we can't go back, can we?

01:25:34.600 --> 01:25:39.600
We are, I mean, trying to.

01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:45.600
We cannot.

01:25:45.600 --> 01:25:46.600
All right.

01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:50.600
Is there any other question from Sahaja Yogis, as we could?

01:25:50.600 --> 01:25:57.600
But don't ask such questions that I can't answer here.

01:25:57.600 --> 01:26:09.600
Please.

01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:20.600
Yes, please, again?

01:26:20.600 --> 01:26:27.600
Was it?

01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:32.600
I didn't follow this.

01:26:32.600 --> 01:26:35.600
Mind in this life or next life?

01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:38.600
Oh, I understand, now I've understood.

01:26:38.600 --> 01:26:41.600
No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:26:41.600 --> 01:26:45.600
You see, soul is different from spirit.

01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:50.600
Spirit is the light of the soul, all right?

01:26:50.600 --> 01:26:52.600
Let's differentiate it.

01:26:52.600 --> 01:27:07.600
And then the soul is, I have to tell you, all the five elements that are within us, they form the soul.

01:27:07.600 --> 01:27:14.600
And the light of the soul is the spirit, all right?

01:27:14.600 --> 01:27:20.600
No, no, no, but it doesn't transform from one to another.

01:27:20.600 --> 01:27:24.600
There's no transformation between this to that, all right?

01:27:24.600 --> 01:27:31.600
So today's mind becomes a spirit, next life as you are saying, how?

01:27:31.600 --> 01:27:37.600
Because today's mind realizes that mind is not sufficient.

01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:45.600
So it ascends to the spirit root, to the self root, all right?

01:27:45.600 --> 01:27:57.600
Through the mind it acquires the understanding, the logic that you have to ascend.

01:27:57.600 --> 01:28:07.600
But it doesn't come out of your mind, it comes out of the mind of God Almighty, the spirit,

01:28:07.600 --> 01:28:11.600
which is untarnishable, unchangeable.

01:28:11.600 --> 01:28:20.600
But by following your mind you realize that mind is not the last one.

01:28:20.600 --> 01:28:22.600
Or same with emotions.

01:28:22.600 --> 01:28:28.600
So many people who have failed in their emotional life, in a way are specially blessed,

01:28:28.600 --> 01:28:35.600
because they give up that kind of a madness and achieve spirit.

01:28:35.600 --> 01:28:43.600
But it's not the same.

01:28:43.600 --> 01:28:47.600
It's very detached, it's not attached to any elements.

01:28:47.600 --> 01:28:51.600
Spirit is detached from all emotions.

01:28:51.600 --> 01:29:00.600
It can see everything, but it's detached.

01:29:00.600 --> 01:29:05.600
I followed your question all right, isn't it?

01:29:05.600 --> 01:29:08.600
You understood it, huh?

01:29:08.600 --> 01:29:11.600
You got your answer all right.

01:29:11.600 --> 01:29:15.600
I'm happy.

01:29:15.600 --> 01:29:25.600
That's a good question, but it was rather a bridged form of a question, but I managed it somehow.

01:29:25.600 --> 01:29:35.600
Now I'm happy because sometimes you know, the people are so alert that you ask very nice questions,

01:29:35.600 --> 01:29:56.600
but I'm not so intelligent, I must confess, as you people are, because I don't use my mind at all.

01:29:56.600 --> 01:30:07.600
But you can reach the point very easily if you have your spirit intact, because it's light.

01:30:07.600 --> 01:30:13.600
Intelligence, if it is pure intelligence, what you call, that's the intelligence of the spirit.

01:30:13.600 --> 01:30:18.600
It just is the point exactly.

01:30:18.600 --> 01:30:22.600
But the intelligence that we understand is very different, you see.

01:30:22.600 --> 01:30:34.600
It plays with the words, it baffles you, it's brilliant, your eyes can get completely shut with that.

01:30:34.600 --> 01:30:38.600
But it's not pure intelligence.

01:30:38.600 --> 01:30:57.600
Pure intelligence just gives you the absolute easels of everything.

01:30:57.600 --> 01:31:16.600
That's the intelligence of the spirit, not of the mind.

01:31:16.600 --> 01:31:31.600
Any other question please?

01:31:31.600 --> 01:31:40.600
You go, is it there? Any German question?

01:31:40.600 --> 01:31:47.600
You may, questions also have denominations and things.

01:31:47.600 --> 01:31:53.600
Let us be in a very pleasant mood. I'm trying to bring you to a pleasant mood. Please be in a pleasant mood.

01:31:53.600 --> 01:32:00.600
And now, is there any question?

01:32:00.600 --> 01:32:04.600
Mr. Raja Ji, do you have any questions?

01:32:04.600 --> 01:32:10.600
Is everyone answered?

01:32:10.600 --> 01:32:19.600
Yes, madam?

01:32:19.600 --> 01:32:40.600
Sir, the question is, if your German question was your ask for...

01:32:40.600 --> 01:32:42.600
German question.

01:32:42.600 --> 01:32:48.600
How did I know there's a German lurking somewhere?

01:32:48.600 --> 01:32:53.600
Now explain, what does she say?

01:32:53.600 --> 01:33:10.600
Because God wanted you to be here.

01:33:10.600 --> 01:33:13.600
What she said?

01:33:13.600 --> 01:33:24.600
Of course, the reason is, is the reflection of God's will, that He wanted us to be here.

01:33:24.600 --> 01:33:31.600
It's not according to our reasoning that God moves. He has his own reasons.

01:33:31.600 --> 01:33:35.600
That He wanted to have something, so He has it.

01:33:35.600 --> 01:33:39.600
He wants to have His children. Why do you have a child?

01:33:39.600 --> 01:33:45.600
Because you want to have. You want to enjoy and cherish.

01:33:45.600 --> 01:33:52.600
That's what God wanted, to enjoy and cherish the love of His children as the child loves you.

01:33:52.600 --> 01:34:08.600
You see, the answer is here.

01:34:08.600 --> 01:34:18.600
She is a realized soul and is clearing her chakras.

01:34:18.600 --> 01:34:22.600
So, my intelligence is with Him, collect.

01:34:22.600 --> 01:34:26.600
He's clearly clearing your this chakra.

01:34:26.600 --> 01:34:44.600
And He understands, because He's a realized soul.

01:34:44.600 --> 01:34:51.600
Misha, just put your hand up, I can't see you.

01:34:51.600 --> 01:35:01.600
You are great. That's your right. That's very, very great.

01:35:01.600 --> 01:35:08.600
Alright, let's have it.

01:35:08.600 --> 01:35:20.600
But all the twenty who are here, I have to make a humble request that please respect your realization.

01:35:20.600 --> 01:35:31.600
Please. Sometimes I weep with frustration.

01:35:31.600 --> 01:35:40.600
And I request you to understand your value and worth in the light of the Spirit.

01:35:40.600 --> 01:35:42.600
Thank you.

01:35:42.600 --> 01:35:50.600
Could you please take out your shoes and sit with your two feet on the ground without crossing the legs.

01:35:50.600 --> 01:36:04.600
And be comfortable. Don't have anything which make you feel tight and put your two hands in the direction of Shri Mataji with the palms upwards. Thank you.

01:36:04.600 --> 01:36:08.600
But the new people should come forward and the Sahaja Yogis must give them room.

01:36:08.600 --> 01:36:10.600
Because you see we have to look after them.

01:36:10.600 --> 01:36:17.600
Yes. So please all the people who are here for the first time, would you please...

01:36:17.600 --> 01:36:21.600
Come in the forward seat. And Sahaja Yogis should go in the forward seat.

01:36:21.600 --> 01:36:27.600
And every Sahaja Yogis who are in the forward seat, please, the first seat. Please move backwards.

01:36:27.600 --> 01:36:31.600
And we are speaking about the seats, not on the ground.

01:36:31.600 --> 01:36:38.600
All the new people, please sit on the first row of seats.

01:36:38.600 --> 01:36:47.600
That's great. She's going to start a center in Vimalaya.

01:36:47.600 --> 01:36:56.600
Let's see. Hope for the best. Keep your fingers crossed.

01:36:56.600 --> 01:37:03.600
Such vibrations. It's better to be there because they'll go into cramps.

01:37:03.600 --> 01:37:10.600
Oh, if this is not enough also on the second row, please Sahaja Yogis, can you leave the second row free?

01:37:10.600 --> 01:37:14.600
Such vibrations, boy, you don't know the idea of Vimalaya.

01:37:14.600 --> 01:37:18.600
Tremendous vibrations.

01:37:18.600 --> 01:37:25.600
Too much vibrations. Yes, good.

01:37:25.600 --> 01:37:31.600
Sahaja Yogis should move from the second row and let people who are new should sit there.

01:37:31.600 --> 01:37:54.600
Please move from the second and the first row also. I mean.

01:37:54.600 --> 01:38:01.600
Please, can you just, as I said, put your two feet on the ground straight, without crossing the legs,

01:38:01.600 --> 01:38:05.600
and put your two hands with the palm upwards in the direction of Shri Mataji.

01:38:05.600 --> 01:38:09.600
If you are sitting on the ground, there's nothing to worry about the feet being on the ground.

01:38:09.600 --> 01:38:17.600
Then you are on the ground. But those who are sitting on the chair, please put both your feet like this on the Mother Earth

01:38:17.600 --> 01:38:38.600
because she sucks in the problems you have. I put both the hands like this towards Me.

01:38:38.600 --> 01:38:53.600
Now you have to close your eyes. Just close your eyes.

01:38:53.600 --> 01:39:07.600
You don't open your eyes till I tell you to open your eyes. So you just keep your eyes shut.

01:39:07.600 --> 01:39:16.600
Now left hand is symbolic of our desire, desire power.

01:39:16.600 --> 01:39:25.600
So we are putting our desire, left hand, asking for our Self-realization.

01:39:25.600 --> 01:39:36.600
So keep it all the time, left hand towards Me. Right hand is the power of action, creation.

01:39:36.600 --> 01:39:48.600
So you have to use the right hand for that. And so you have to put your right hand onto different centers,

01:39:48.600 --> 01:39:58.600
which I will explain to you very, in a very simple way. And you'll be able to understand that you have to put your hand on these centers,

01:39:58.600 --> 01:40:11.600
helping your Kundalini to rise. Now we are working out only on the left hand side of our centers with our right hand.

01:40:11.600 --> 01:40:19.600
So the left hand is towards Me and the right hand goes onto different centers that we have, as simple as that.

01:40:19.600 --> 01:40:30.600
The first one is the one, what we call is the seat of the Spirit, which is the heart, which is on the left hand side.

01:40:30.600 --> 01:40:42.600
So please put your left hand towards Me all the time and the right hand on the heart.

01:40:42.600 --> 01:40:59.600
Now, just on the heart. Now at this place you have to ask Me a very fundamental question.

01:40:59.600 --> 01:41:05.600
Mother, if you call Me Shri Mataji or Mother is the same,

01:41:05.600 --> 01:41:21.600
Mother, am I the Spirit? The fundamental question, just ask Me. Mother, am I the Spirit?

01:41:22.600 --> 01:41:40.600
Ask this question three times. Mother, am I the Spirit?

01:41:40.600 --> 01:41:49.600
So one has to know that if you become the Spirit, you become your own guide, you become your own Guru.

01:41:49.600 --> 01:41:55.600
This is all created by the great prophets and great gurus within you, the possibility.

01:41:55.600 --> 01:42:05.600
So now after this you take down your right hand onto your stomach on the left hand side.

01:42:05.600 --> 01:42:23.600
This is the center of a mastery, mastery of the Divine power, the technique how to use it.

01:42:23.600 --> 01:42:32.600
So here you have to ask another question relevant with the first one, that if I am the Spirit, am I my own master?

01:42:32.600 --> 01:42:49.600
Ask a question now three times. Mother, am I my own master? Put your left hand towards Me and right hand on the left hand side of your stomach in the upper part.

01:42:49.600 --> 01:42:57.600
In the upper part of your stomach on the left hand side, please put your right hand and press it.

01:42:57.600 --> 01:43:13.600
And here you ask Me a question three times. Mother, am I my own master? Am I my own guide? Am I my own Guru?

01:43:13.600 --> 01:43:19.600
This is the blessings of the real Sadguru's.

01:43:28.600 --> 01:43:33.600
Three times.

01:43:40.600 --> 01:43:49.600
Now please take your hand in the lower part of your abdomen on the left hand side.

01:43:50.600 --> 01:44:07.600
Now press it hard. This is the center that works out, first one was the master. This is the center that works out.

01:44:08.600 --> 01:44:18.600
The Divine technique of the true knowledge, of the pure knowledge.

01:44:18.600 --> 01:44:28.600
So now ask a question in a way it's not a question but a request.

01:44:28.600 --> 01:44:45.600
Because unless and until you ask for it, I cannot do it. I cannot cross your freedom. So here you say, Mother please may I have the pure knowledge?

01:44:45.600 --> 01:44:58.600
Mother may I have the pure knowledge? Say it three times. Mother may I have the pure knowledge? Six times.

01:44:58.600 --> 01:45:09.600
Because this center has got six petals. Now this you are asking to initiate the Kundalini, to awaken the Kundalini.

01:45:09.600 --> 01:45:30.600
When you ask for it because it's such an absolute question, the Kundalini awakens. You have to request her.

01:45:30.600 --> 01:45:57.600
Now again raise your hand to the upper portion or upper area of the stomach on the left hand side.

01:45:58.600 --> 01:46:13.600
At the center of the mastery. Here you press it hard and say with full confidence for the Kundalini to rise, to open the center with full assertion,

01:46:13.600 --> 01:46:36.600
Mother I am my own master. Mother I am my own master.

01:46:36.600 --> 01:46:50.600
You have to say this ten times because there are ten masters within us who have built up our ten centers of plexuses of this solar plexus.

01:46:50.600 --> 01:47:19.600
So we have to say ten times with full assertion, Mother I am my own master.

01:47:20.600 --> 01:47:48.600
Now raise your right hand on to the heart. Here again with full confidence within yourself, forgetting all your past,

01:47:48.600 --> 01:48:02.600
forgetting all your problems with full confidence and assertion you have to say, Mother I am the spirit. You have to say it twelve times.

01:48:02.600 --> 01:48:29.600
Mother I am the spirit. You are the spirit. No doubt about it. Believe in yourself, have faith in yourself. Know that you are the spirit and nothing else.

01:48:32.600 --> 01:48:54.600
Now raise your right hand.

01:49:02.600 --> 01:49:31.600
Now raise your right hand in the corner of your left hand.

01:49:32.600 --> 01:49:54.600
Now raise your right hand on to the heart.

01:49:55.600 --> 01:50:16.600
So put it in the corner of the neck and the shoulder. Press it hard on the back bone. Hard.

01:50:16.600 --> 01:50:34.600
This is the worst center we have in the West that we feel guilty for nothing at all. What is the feeling guilty? You are the spirit. How can spirit make mistakes? And God is the ocean of love and compassion.

01:50:34.600 --> 01:50:52.600
But above all he is the ocean of forgiveness. What guilt can you have? What mistakes can you commit that his power of forgiveness cannot forgive? You are not to be guilty.

01:50:52.600 --> 01:51:21.600
Forget my lecture, forget everything. You are the pure immaculate spirit. You are Sachinanda. You are the source of all that is joy.

01:51:22.600 --> 01:51:51.600
Better. You have to say this sixteen times. You are the spirit.

01:51:52.600 --> 01:52:21.600
Mother, I am not guilty. Sixteen times. Press it hard and say it sixteen times.

01:52:22.600 --> 01:52:51.600
Now move. In the beginning it was terrible.

01:52:52.600 --> 01:53:18.600
Now take this hand and put it across your forehead please. Stretch your left hand towards me. At this point, not how many times, but from your heart you have to say, Mother I forgive everyone.

01:53:19.600 --> 01:53:30.600
Something that is very difficult to forgive. It's a myth. Because whether you forgive or not forgive you don't do anything about.

01:53:30.600 --> 01:53:50.600
But if you don't forgive then you play into the wrong hands. So please say, Mother I forgive. That's the greatest weapon you have. Mother I forgive.

01:53:50.600 --> 01:54:11.600
Everyone, first of all yourself.

01:54:11.600 --> 01:54:40.600
Now on the back of your head. Hold it tight. Now for your own consolation you can say that, Oh God Almighty or, Oh my Kundalini the Mother, if I have done anything wrong in your glory, in your name please forgive me.

01:54:41.600 --> 01:54:57.600
Not to feel guilty at all. Please don't feel guilty. But just say it out. Don't count all your so called sins. Just forget it, forget it, forget it.

01:54:57.600 --> 01:55:14.600
Now raise your hand on top of your head on the fontanel bone area. Stretch your palm and press it hard in a clockwise manner.

01:55:14.600 --> 01:55:43.600
Take your right hand on top of your head on the fontanel bone area which was a soft bone in your childhood. Press it hard and here in a clockwise manner when you move it you have to say something which I cannot do it without it because you are free.

01:55:44.600 --> 01:56:13.600
So you have to say, Mother I want my realization. I cannot force on you. So to say I want my realization, plz please give me my self realization. Just say that. Press it hard. Press it hard. Stretch your palm on top of fontanel bone area. Now seven times.

01:56:14.600 --> 01:56:21.600
Now seven times.

01:56:21.600 --> 01:56:28.600
Now seven times.

01:56:51.600 --> 01:57:13.600
Now bring down your right hand please. The most valuable moment of your life in the most precious, important, happening.

01:57:13.600 --> 01:57:34.600
Now please press your right hand towards me and left hand on top of your head bending the head about say three four inches and move the hand and see if there's any cool breeze coming out of your own head. Please.
