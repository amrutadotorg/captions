00:07.280 --> 00:10.000
How do we recognize those teachers

00:10.210 --> 00:13.450
that You might call fraudulent from the real ones?

00:13.650 --> 00:16.890
It’s so difficult because they all seem to be able to

00:17.011 --> 00:20.009
inspire us in certain ways and give us experiences.

00:20.130 --> 00:24.090
How do we know who is teaching something that’s true

00:24.290 --> 00:26.650
and who is being deceptive?

00:26.850 --> 00:28.410
First and foremost thing is:

00:28.610 --> 00:33.010
anybody who lives on your earnings is not a guru.

00:33.770 --> 00:38.210
A guru will never live on the earnings of his disciples.

00:38.530 --> 00:41.050
But here there are people who have big palaces,

00:41.290 --> 00:44.810
bought aircrafts and cars and this.

00:45.010 --> 00:48.450
I mean, this is something one should understand. It’s so,

00:48.570 --> 00:51.810
so open to you to understand.

00:51.930 --> 00:56.850
I mean, I cannot understand more obvious thing that this one is

00:57.050 --> 00:58.570
that it’s a parasitic living.

00:58.770 --> 01:01.370
And you cannot have a parasites as your gurus.

01:01.570 --> 01:04.050
They can be parasites but not your gurus.

01:04.250 --> 01:07.010
That’s one of the things. And if you can…

01:08.130 --> 01:10.330
I mean, you can retain some people, you know?

01:10.450 --> 01:13.490
If you want because you are rich people, you can retain some.

01:13.610 --> 01:16.490
That’s a different point. But you cannot have them as gurus.

01:16.690 --> 01:19.810
Guru has to be a higher personality, you see?

01:20.010 --> 01:24.490
Now you have seen Christ was such a great incarnation.

01:24.770 --> 01:26.690
He didn’t take any money from anyone.

01:26.890 --> 01:30.250
He was a carpenter’s son and He used to do carpentry Himself

01:30.450 --> 01:32.130
and He lived like a modest man.

01:32.330 --> 01:36.450
He never lived with big cars and big houses. It’s not necessary

01:36.650 --> 01:40.330
because such a person is Himself, He is a very big king, you see,

01:40.450 --> 01:42.570
like a big emperor.

01:42.690 --> 01:45.570
He doesn’t need anything, an emperor doesn’t need anything

01:45.690 --> 01:48.410
because nothing can give him comfort

01:48.610 --> 01:51.210
except that He Himself is in complete comfort.

01:51.450 --> 01:53.650
So such a person doesn’t want anything.

01:53.850 --> 01:58.050
So you must see that such a person has no needs of comfort at all.

01:58.290 --> 02:01.890
He can sleep on the grounds, he can sleep anywhere.

02:02.090 --> 02:03.970
Now, in this life,

02:04.170 --> 02:07.410
I should say I come from a quite a wealthy family

02:07.610 --> 02:10.890
or married to another wealthy man, you can say that way,

02:11.050 --> 02:13.930
according to your own relative ideas.

02:14.130 --> 02:17.290
But to Me,

02:17.490 --> 02:19.610
I can sleep anywhere. I have no problem.

02:19.810 --> 02:21.090
I have no problem of food,

02:21.290 --> 02:23.930
no problem of sleeping anywhere, no comfort.

02:24.130 --> 02:27.610
And I find it is beyond My self-respect

02:27.810 --> 02:30.490
to live on the earnings of others. It’s not proper.

02:30.690 --> 02:31.890
But you are My children;

02:32.050 --> 02:35.370
supposing now you bring a flower to Me or something, it’s all right.

02:35.570 --> 02:39.050
But I can’t have a palace out of your money and all those things.

02:39.250 --> 02:40.810
It’s absurd, absolutely absurd!

02:41.010 --> 02:44.810
So this is one thing one should know that it pampers our ego,

02:45.010 --> 02:47.090
that we can purchase our guru,

02:47.290 --> 02:49.410
we can purchase our Self-Realization.

02:49.610 --> 02:52.690
You see, this is a very subtle pampering.

02:52.930 --> 02:54.730
And that’s how people accept, you see?

02:54.930 --> 02:58.210
They don’t want to accept a person who says,

02:58.450 --> 03:01.010
“You cannot offer anything.”  It’s too much for them.

03:01.250 --> 03:05.810
Or maybe that, secondly, could be that people think

03:06.050 --> 03:09.810
that if you pay something then you get attached to it,

03:10.010 --> 03:11.730
you go through it whatever it is.

03:11.890 --> 03:14.130
Say you have paid for a ticket

03:14.250 --> 03:17.050
and you find that the whole play is horrid, you can’t bear it,

03:17.170 --> 03:19.730
but you have to go through it because you have paid for it.

03:19.890 --> 03:21.330
That’s a human nature, you see?

03:21.450 --> 03:23.850
That’s a human nature. I have seen that they do it.

03:23.970 --> 03:25.690
And that’s what it works out.

03:25.890 --> 03:28.010
But this is very gross level, I’m telling you.

03:28.210 --> 03:31.970
But another should be that in these modern times it is promised

03:32.170 --> 03:34.650
that you will become prophets.

03:35.570 --> 03:37.410
You have to become prophets.

03:37.610 --> 03:41.010
So you must see have you become prophets out of these?

03:41.210 --> 03:44.850
Is... easiest is to see the disciples of this man,

03:45.050 --> 03:47.050
any XYZ who says he is a guru.

03:47.290 --> 03:50.490
Now what is happening to the disciple? Is he a free person?

03:50.730 --> 03:52.490
Has he got any knowledge?

03:52.610 --> 03:54.330
Has he got any mastery?

03:54.490 --> 03:56.730
What has he achieved by being with that person?

03:56.850 --> 03:59.050
Now, you have seen here there are Sahaja Yogis.

03:59.170 --> 04:00.410
One better than the other!

04:00.530 --> 04:03.130
You talk to them, they are knowledge.

04:04.090 --> 04:06.850
Some of them have met Me only for, say, eight day or so.

04:06.970 --> 04:08.210
They have become knowledge.

04:08.330 --> 04:10.450
So what have they achieved you should say.

04:10.650 --> 04:14.450
What is their style of life, their pattern of life, how they behave?

04:14.650 --> 04:17.010
And there cannot be any privacy about it,

04:17.210 --> 04:18.450
you see, like mafia -

04:18.650 --> 04:20.930
you don’t tell that and you don’t say that

04:21.130 --> 04:22.330
and you shouldn’t do that.

04:22.530 --> 04:24.490
Of course, in Sahaja Yoga

04:24.890 --> 04:27.450
the truth is exposed gradually,

04:27.650 --> 04:31.450
but it is not like this that if you give some money, nobody knows.

04:31.650 --> 04:34.170
Everybody knows everything in Sahaja Yoga, you see?

04:34.290 --> 04:37.930
Now supposing we have to build an ashram, say for example.

04:38.050 --> 04:40.650
All right, you build your ashram, you collect your money,

04:40.770 --> 04:43.690
do what you like and know about it. I have nothing to do with it.

04:43.810 --> 04:46.490
Also among yourself you should know how you got the money,

04:46.610 --> 04:48.970
how you spent it, what is the expense and all that.

04:49.090 --> 04:51.690
Because ashram you can pay for

04:51.890 --> 04:54.290
but not for your Realization.

04:54.810 --> 04:57.930
And this is one thing is very important,

04:58.130 --> 05:00.570
that what you get out of it is important,

05:00.770 --> 05:03.410
that you should become a prophet.

05:03.970 --> 05:06.170
Have you become a prophet?

05:06.290 --> 05:09.530
Then, thirdly, you must know that if you are going from one to another,

05:09.650 --> 05:13.010
what we call guru shopping business; that means you have not found it.

05:13.130 --> 05:14.930
Otherwise, you would just settle down.

05:15.130 --> 05:18.330
But some people are so weak that they do settle down with one

05:18.530 --> 05:20.370
and are finished with them.

05:20.650 --> 05:22.290
You must always see the people

05:22.490 --> 05:25.250
who go to these gurus, what have they got.

05:25.450 --> 05:28.850
Have they got their transformation?

05:30.010 --> 05:32.850
Because this is the age of transformation.

05:33.050 --> 05:37.250
Mataji, what about teachers or gurus who produce miracles?

05:37.370 --> 05:39.530
You go to a guru

05:39.650 --> 05:42.890
who materialize something out of the air and say, “This is divine”.

05:43.010 --> 05:44.410
That’s a very serious question.

05:44.530 --> 05:46.330
This is all jugglery. It’s all jugglery.

05:46.450 --> 05:48.770
And also, you see, now supposing somebody says,

05:48.890 --> 05:50.490
“I produce a diamond”.

05:50.610 --> 05:52.290
Now these people come from India.

05:52.410 --> 05:56.290
Why don’t they solve the financial problem of India?

06:01.050 --> 06:04.010
Secondly, you see, at every point they can be challenged.

06:04.130 --> 06:06.090
You should say that, "Then, all right"...

06:06.210 --> 06:08.930
One gentleman came to Me; he said that, “He gave me a diamond.”

06:09.050 --> 06:10.930
I said, “Why you? How many diamonds you have?”

06:11.130 --> 06:13.410
He has said, “Hundreds.” Then I said, “Why did he give you?

06:13.530 --> 06:16.250
He should give to your driver who hasn’t got a diamond”.

06:16.450 --> 06:19.130
You see, that is what it is. So it is all jugglery.

06:19.330 --> 06:22.090
You should see those who materialize,

06:22.370 --> 06:24.210
what have they given you?

06:24.410 --> 06:26.690
They have to give you something eternal.

06:26.970 --> 06:28.330
If they talk about God,

06:28.450 --> 06:30.170
God is not going to give you diamond.

06:30.290 --> 06:32.130
Which God has given diamonds to people?

06:32.330 --> 06:35.570
Have you heard of anyone giving diamonds? No!

06:36.770 --> 06:40.570
So you should ask for something which is the highest,

06:40.770 --> 06:42.810
which is the supreme most.

06:43.050 --> 06:46.570
Now the fourth thing, which is very important,

06:47.210 --> 06:50.010
that whatever experiences you get -

06:50.210 --> 06:52.610
for example, some people start just like jumping,

06:52.850 --> 06:55.970
some start shouting, some start behaving like animals.

06:56.090 --> 06:58.330
And they say, “Oh, that’s what is coming out.

06:58.450 --> 07:00.050
You are taking out, you see.”

07:00.170 --> 07:03.170
They feel very bad, they get horrible diseases,

07:03.370 --> 07:05.810
they get into troubles and they get into pains

07:06.010 --> 07:08.010
and all sorts of things and contortions.

07:08.210 --> 07:10.530
They say, “Now, your subconscious is coming out”.

07:10.730 --> 07:13.890
Nothing has to be brought out. That’s one thing you must know.

07:14.090 --> 07:16.970
The subconscious, as I told you, is on the left hand side

07:17.170 --> 07:19.650
and the supraconscious on the right hand side.

07:19.850 --> 07:24.370
What you have to do is to ascend in the center and come up.

07:24.570 --> 07:27.410
Above your head is the super-consciousness

07:27.610 --> 07:29.370
and when you become that,

07:29.570 --> 07:32.210
then you develop collective consciousness.

07:32.410 --> 07:36.170
So those who want you to become like frogs again,

07:36.410 --> 07:40.250
you must know that you are not going to become frogs anymore.

07:40.610 --> 07:43.250
That’s not anyway evolution.

07:43.450 --> 07:46.090
The evolution has to go higher,

07:46.290 --> 07:49.170
not becoming frogs or earthworms, you see?

07:49.370 --> 07:52.730
And if you start crawling, it is simple mesmerism.

07:52.930 --> 07:56.010
Anybody mesmerizes can do these tricks, you see?

07:56.210 --> 07:57.570
It’s simple mesmerism.

07:57.770 --> 08:00.970
And then to believe that now you are surrendered and all that

08:01.170 --> 08:02.690
is all nonsense, you see?

08:02.890 --> 08:06.210
It has no meaning to Realization.

08:06.450 --> 08:08.850
In Realization, you just become the master.

08:09.050 --> 08:11.010
You become the master of it.

08:11.210 --> 08:14.250
There are many people in this country who came

08:14.650 --> 08:17.330
and lured you by their talks also,

08:17.530 --> 08:22.610
talking big about Brahma, Atmatattva, this, that and everything.

08:22.810 --> 08:24.090
That is not the way you can,

08:24.290 --> 08:27.330
that is what is just the pendulum moving

08:27.530 --> 08:30.170
from Christian sermon to Hindu sermon

08:30.410 --> 08:32.850
and from Hindu sermon to Islamic sermon,

08:33.050 --> 08:35.130
from there to the Rabbi sermon.

08:35.330 --> 08:38.090
You see, it goes on like that, you see? That’s not the way.

08:38.210 --> 08:40.330
You have to rise higher within yourself.

08:40.450 --> 08:42.970
And that’s why those who lecture about these things

08:43.090 --> 08:45.930
are really sometimes can be very, very dangerous.

08:46.050 --> 08:49.130
And so many have died of cancer, this, that.

08:49.250 --> 08:52.370
I don’t know what to say that people who go to these people

08:52.570 --> 08:55.490
get into very bad troubles and suffer so much.

08:55.690 --> 08:58.010
And then on top of that when all this happens,

08:58.210 --> 09:00.410
they say, “You must suffer.”

09:01.170 --> 09:05.290
That’s a very good excuse, “You must suffer”.
You must pay to suffer.

09:05.410 --> 09:08.170
Pay money to suffer.

09:08.890 --> 09:10.530
And then people go on suffering.

09:10.650 --> 09:14.010
Now one thing I have to tell you that Christ has suffered for us.

09:14.370 --> 09:15.970
We don’t have to suffer anymore.

09:16.170 --> 09:19.570
Those who deny His sufferings, will have to go for suffering.

09:19.770 --> 09:22.330
All right, have it! But He suffered for us.

09:22.530 --> 09:25.010
There is no need for us to suffer anymore.

09:25.250 --> 09:27.170
When He is awakened within us,

09:27.370 --> 09:30.530
He takes away all that is our ego means our karmas,

09:30.730 --> 09:34.250
our superego, that is our conditioning, completely removed,

09:34.450 --> 09:36.650
and you become one with the Divine.

09:36.850 --> 09:39.090
There is no need for anybody to suffer

09:39.290 --> 09:42.010
and this idea of suffering is all nonsensical.

09:42.210 --> 09:45.170
You should not suffer at all.

09:45.290 --> 09:47.170
Good!
