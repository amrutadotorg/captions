00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.680
We read like mad,

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.440
we listen to people like mad,

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:22.760
we like those who give us feed for our mental being.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.280
They're so mental, so argumentative,

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.080
think no end of their intelligence,

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.440
that you have to just say, “All right, namaskar.”

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.680
You can't fight their mental attitude.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.920
That's why Christ

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.320
is to be worshipped

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.280
by people who are so very mental.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.760
And this mental nonsense has given

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.280
such a sense of superiority to people.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.680
“Oh, whatever we do, what's wrong? What's wrong?”

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.680
They cannot correct themselves

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.680
because unless and until you cross this limit of mental being,

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.840
you cannot see yourself.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.520
You cannot introspect . You cannot see yourself.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.760
You'll see others, “These Sahaja Yogis are like this,

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.280
Sahaja Yoga is like that,” all kinds of things.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.000
But you can't see yourself,

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.080
because the whole thing is mental.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:53.080
This mental attitude should be completely curbed

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:59.920
through the help of our Lord Jesus Christ.

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.080
But He's also mental,

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.920
in your brains Christ is also mental, now what to do?

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.920
The One who broke the mental attitude is also a mental -

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.440
you have made Him into mental, like a statue

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.760
of stone.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.080
So, firstly we have to tell ourselves,

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.680
“Now don't think, don't think, don't think, don't think.”

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.520
Four times,

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.600
and then you can rise above.

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.000
And this is very important.

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:50.000
In meditation you have to go beyond the mind.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:55.680
And thanks to Christ that He’s sitting at the Agnya

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.440
to finish off this nonsense of mental being.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.520
I think people should stop reading also perhaps, maybe.

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.080
Even My lecture becomes mental, what to do?

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.680
I mean everything goes into their head becomes mental, somehow.

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.680
And then they ask Me questions, “Mother, did You say it this way,

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:27.280
what did You -” I said, “I said it to make you thoughtless.

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.680
Just to stun you,

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:36.680
I didn’t say this to sit down and analyze and do, no, no.

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:44.080
I said this that you become absolutely shocked and stunned.”

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.520
So the best thing for all of you is

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.680
to become thoughtless.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.080
That’s the blessing of Christ,

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.840
that’s what He worked it out for you.

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.000
And I am sure,

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.680
if you work it out that don’t pay attention to others.

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.840
Don’t react,

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.200
just don’t react.

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:23.680
Everything they will see, they’ll react.

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.000
What is the need?

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.280
What is the use?

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.200
What are you going to do with that reaction?

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.520
This reaction creates nothing but ripples of thoughts

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.000
in your mind, I’ve told you hundreds of times.

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:51.200
And now you have to become

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.080
absolutely thoughtless

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.440
after this puja.

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:03.840
If that happens, I think we have achieved a lot.

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:08.840
That’s the biggest blessing that Christ has given you,

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.080
which you should really enjoy.

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:20.080
Then only this Akash Tattwa in you will work.

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.680
And how it works?

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.680
Through your attention,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.080
it works with Me as you know.

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.160
With My attention I work out many things.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.080
How?

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:42.680
Just My attention has become thoughtless,

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.920
just thoughtless.

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.440
It goes wherever it goes, it works.

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:54.600
But if you put your attention for thought all the time

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:57.520
for thinking,

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:02.840
then it doesn’t do the work that it has supposed to do.

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:08.160
Attention works marvelously

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.680
if you are thoughtless, otherwise it doesn’t.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:22.440
So it has to rise from your own self.

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:26.840
Then from others

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:30.840
to the higher level of humanity,

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:35.000
where you are in communication with the sky,

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:38.000
with, we can call it as the

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:44.160
tanmatra, or the essential, or the essence

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:47.440
of ether.

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:52.680
With ether you can have television, you can have telephone.

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:54.920
It's a miracle otherwise.

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:58.200
But with this tanmatra,

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:00.680
sitting down here

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:04.080
you can do the job.

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:06.680
It works,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.200
just attention works. I know that.

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.280
You also know very well.

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:15.920
You don't have to ask Me to put the attention,

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:19.680
you just put the attention and it will work out.

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:25.000
It’s a very important thing that you have got.

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:29.080
I think that is the first thing -

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:31.680
once you have,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.600
no problem.

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:41.680
But we start manifesting from the earth element.

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:47.680
Then from the agni(fire) element, then from the jala (water) element,

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:52.600
and then we come to tejas (light),

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:56.840
where the face starts shining.

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:02.160
But lastly we get this thoughtless awareness

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:07.760
by which our attention is absolutely free to do

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:11.360
some special work.

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:14.680
But if you are all the time thinking,

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:18.200
then poor this attention

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:22.520
is so busy, you know, so very busy.

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:25.760
You don't have to ask Me then,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.080
"Mother, please pay attention." You can pay attention,

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:31.920
and you can work it out.

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:42.360
In this attention, you don't feel

00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:45.680
what you've got, what you are standing,

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:52.520
what you are wearing, what others are doing - no, nothing.

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:56.680
You are one with yourself.

00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:02.680
And it's a life full of humor.

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:06.680
So much humor.

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:09.080
So much of joy.

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:12.280
So much of happiness

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:15.600
that you don't care for anything

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:18.760
that normally people care for.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.080
So,

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:31.760
as it is now Sahaja Yoga has worked in so many countries.

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:35.680
I'm so very proud of you, very proud.

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:39.680
And now it is also going to African countries,

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:44.080
is a very great satisfaction for Me.

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:49.680
And you all can do it;

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.680
you all can work it out.

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:57.680
Only thing, become thoughtlessly aware,

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:00.200
as the blessing of Christ.

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:02.680
If it works,

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:09.360
you will be absolutely enjoying yourself.

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:13.360
So may God bless you.
