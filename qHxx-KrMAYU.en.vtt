00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:24.800
now then we have another Center on top

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:27.770
which we called as the heart center it

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.930
is in the center now in the sternum bone

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:33.200
behind the sternum bone this Center is

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:36.559
there and time time us produces the

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:40.120
antibodies in your sternum bone these

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:42.829
antibodies later on fight your diseases

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:45.110
when you are about 12 years of age did

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:50.720
they go into the whole body and waiting

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:53.329
there for a signal from your sternum

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.950
bone that means supposing you see

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:57.649
something you get frightened this bone

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.420
starts pulsating when it pulsates the

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:03.460
antibodies know there's some emergency

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:06.469
and they get prepared for it now this is

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:09.590
such a normal thing to happen to people

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:12.320
but insecurities car can be of the worst

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.450
time and when these insecurities they

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.829
were developed people can develop all

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.319
kinds of diseases of the lungs

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:21.200
especially the women develop what you

00:01:18.319 --> 00:01:23.179
call as the breast cancer mostly these

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.670
women are insecure maybe their husbands

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:26.990
are not good or they feel that the

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.159
husband may leave them alone or

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.869
something like that

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:31.909
there are certainly insecurities that

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:35.060
are built in they might be quite

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:37.490
frightening personalities I've seen most

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.439
of the air hostesses have this central

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.389
heart catch it because they are afraid

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:43.369
they may miss the play you know I don't

00:01:41.389 --> 00:01:47.299
know they have to be on the job and run

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:50.270
and do mostly this time-bound jobs cause

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:52.999
you a trouble here of the center heart

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.340
and this Center heart is very important

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:57.439
because for women specially they have to

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.329
be secured if their motherhood is

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:01.909
challenged then they are even worse and

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:04.340
this is how one has to understand a

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:07.039
woman should be very much respected if

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.289
she is your wife is your child or

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:12.080
anything she has to be respected and

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:14.120
given all the security is the woman who

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.400
makes the society is the movement who

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.340
creates the children the woman who looks

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.980
after this so the men have to give all

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.129
the security and the protection

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:26.379
- the women hood and understand that is

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:28.810
a very important factor which we

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:31.599
phenolate we can have lots of problems

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.910
with our society and the women will

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:37.590
start competing with men and then the

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.590
society will be all dislocated

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:46.230
[Music]

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:49.440
if there's any problem with your father

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:53.069
in the right side caches and it gives

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.720
you ask them first of all you are we can

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:56.790
save vulnerable to ask them are you too

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.069
bad liver plus if you have problems with

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.140
your father or eat with your father

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:03.300
supposing you are unhappy father or

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.250
maybe that you are not looking after

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:08.310
your children then you get the center

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.739
got a very bad thing it can happen to

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:14.910
any one of us if a man is unkind to

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:17.489
assume it's a father principle if the

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:20.819
son is unkind to the father so the

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:24.090
father is hurt it's the father principle

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:26.880
if it is disturbed by any chance or a

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:30.959
suddenly father dies and you feel the

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:33.000
pinch of that all your life all that can

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:37.410
work out here and you get this right

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.959
heart catch with that you get a stoma it

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.730
is said that in homeopathic they believe

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:43.830
that with more tension you get because

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:46.319
when if you have more tense you see you

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:47.970
remember your father if he was yet he

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:51.209
would have met you in the subconscious

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:57.870
some time signals and that's how it adds

00:03:51.209 --> 00:04:01.140
to the it is so simple to work out that

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:04.049
could be amazed that if you have to just

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:06.180
raise the principle of father in a

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:08.670
person like that who might be dejected

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.380
father who might be a cruel father who

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:13.829
might be a son who has lost the father

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:17.239
can be anything that you have to just

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:17.239
put your hand on that part

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:30.350
[Music]

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:33.490
left-hand side of this is the essence of

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:33.490
Mother Nature

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:44.260
if in your childhood your mother had

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:49.490
played a role which has given you fear

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:52.370
or kind of a frightening experience then

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:57.410
this Center goes out we say the left

00:04:52.370 --> 00:05:01.070
heart attack but damn if you are a bad

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:03.440
mother all through youth like that the

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:07.640
center is very important on the left

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:09.170
hand side is the mother's side and the

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:11.960
mother itself

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:14.870
the mother is a lunatic you get a

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:17.000
problem there you might get it we find a

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:18.680
heart there are two hearts one is the

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:23.060
heart of the spirit and one is the heart

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:25.850
chakra if a mother is affinity is she's

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:27.860
a woman who is very fanatic about her

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:30.560
food things like that when the children

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:32.810
get it it's a dangerous thing to play

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:35.150
with children like that to have complete

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:37.670
discipline on the children and just give

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:40.370
them must walk straight like a horse for

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:42.080
two things children should be allowed to

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:44.000
have their freedom actually when we

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:46.040
suppress them too much they become

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.800
Milligan's that way Indians are better

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:50.330
they know how to bring up their children

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:53.090
with this cruelty towards children I

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:55.010
don't know what women are up to we're

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:57.830
not going to take their figures and

00:05:55.010 --> 00:06:03.550
their duties and everything in front of

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:07.040
God such cruelty exists such

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:08.960
self-centeredness then with all this the

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:10.310
children develop this trouble and they

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:16.550
have palpitations

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:18.470
they have very weak hearts or when the

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:19.250
children are not nice to the mother they

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:22.010
also get it

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:25.030
so mother and father are very important

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:27.290
factors in sahaja yoga and you have to

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:30.140
understand that if your parents have

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:32.330
been unkind to you you must forgive them

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:33.569
just forget about them because they have

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:35.279
given you birth

00:06:33.569 --> 00:06:38.460
should be thankful and just forget about

00:06:35.279 --> 00:06:42.229
them that's the best way to get over the

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:42.229
problem of left and right heart

00:06:48.259 --> 00:06:51.929
so I've explained to you all these

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:56.939
things now this is the heart in the

00:06:51.929 --> 00:07:02.539
heart resides the spirit the spirit is

00:06:56.939 --> 00:07:02.539
watching the game of this creation

00:07:02.659 --> 00:07:11.189
it is watching what is happening to this

00:07:07.949 --> 00:07:12.860
person this person to this person to

00:07:11.189 --> 00:07:17.159
this person

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:22.289
everybody has got in their heart the

00:07:17.159 --> 00:07:24.389
spirit which is watching is called as

00:07:22.289 --> 00:07:31.169
the shaker you mean the one the knower

00:07:24.389 --> 00:07:34.050
of the field you know what where you go

00:07:31.169 --> 00:07:37.499
what we states to create you watch he

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:40.580
doesn't interfere if you only the

00:07:37.499 --> 00:07:43.169
interference comes from here from that

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:47.069
which tries to give you conscience which

00:07:43.169 --> 00:07:50.189
tries to improve you from here sometimes

00:07:47.069 --> 00:07:52.319
to become part it tries to tell you be

00:07:50.189 --> 00:07:56.519
in the center by punishing you by

00:07:52.319 --> 00:07:59.639
showing it is wrong but he is that

00:07:56.519 --> 00:08:04.849
watching the game let's see how far it

00:07:59.639 --> 00:08:10.559
goes he is the knower of your teeth

00:08:04.849 --> 00:08:12.689
he is the universal green video he the

00:08:10.559 --> 00:08:18.809
reflection of that God Almighty is a

00:08:12.689 --> 00:08:22.499
spectator within and his power is this

00:08:18.809 --> 00:08:28.669
all-pervading power which has created

00:08:22.499 --> 00:08:33.659
all so to fill this all-pervading power

00:08:28.669 --> 00:08:35.579
you have to become the spirit all this

00:08:33.659 --> 00:08:39.209
creation has no meaning if you do not

00:08:35.579 --> 00:08:42.539
become listed in the Vegas of first the

00:08:39.209 --> 00:08:44.709
very first anger says that by reading

00:08:42.539 --> 00:08:47.630
Vedas if you do not be

00:08:44.709 --> 00:08:50.390
we believe with waiting what comes on

00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:53.060
whether we the means to know if you do

00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:57.649
not become the knowledge that it has

00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:59.839
don't that's the question you are

00:08:57.649 --> 00:09:02.500
talking about the spirit being in the

00:08:59.839 --> 00:09:05.120
heart chakra there over on the left side

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:07.670
I'd like to know why it's on the left

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:10.010
instead of in the middle because if the

00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:11.870
spirit is has to do with realization why

00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:14.390
isn't it in the middle and central

00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:15.730
Kundalini instead of on inside like that

00:09:14.390 --> 00:09:19.190
and why is it

00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:23.029
whining that much yeah I guess the main

00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:25.070
thing they not that's the last one's

00:09:23.029 --> 00:09:29.570
heart stops we don't exist

00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:32.140
she exists that's the most important of

00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:32.140
my god

00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:43.379
once the spirit is angry in any way

00:09:35.279 --> 00:09:45.990
strange anyway despaired then we don't

00:09:43.379 --> 00:09:49.940
there's nothing left heart is very

00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:56.169
important that's fine
