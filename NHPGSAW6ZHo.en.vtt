00:00:05.773 --> 00:00:12.443
Interviewer: What do You think, is the reason
of all this corruption of the political instability?

00:00:13.164 --> 00:00:20.324
Shri Mataji: Is ignorance, it is ignorance.
They think by having money or by having

00:00:20.324 --> 00:00:28.241
big position or by having a big name,
they'll be happy; They will not be happy,

00:00:28.241 --> 00:00:33.731
only the ego will be pampered. When it is
slightly hurt, the person will be unhappy.

00:00:33.731 --> 00:00:39.398
So, he'll be going into from happiness
into unhappiness. But when he gets the

00:00:39.398 --> 00:00:44.791
knowledge, that it is the Spirit which is
the source of joy, then he doesn't care for

00:00:44.791 --> 00:00:49.088
money, doesn't care for all these things.
He's not afraid of anything, he lives like

00:00:49.088 --> 00:00:53.688
a lord himself - he's a lord. He doesn't
want anything. You see, the one who's a lord,

00:00:53.688 --> 00:00:58.241
doesn't want anything. For example, now
as you know, I come from a rich family,

00:00:58.241 --> 00:01:01.539
My husband from a rich family, he's
now well to do,

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:07.103
we have very comfortable living but I can
live on a street, I can sleep on a street

00:01:07.103 --> 00:01:11.970
because I'm like a Queen, I don't need
anything. If you need anything,

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.686
then you are a beggar otherwise you are
a Queen, isn't it? That's what I feel.

00:01:16.686 --> 00:01:22.797
So, that is what, is the ignorance. Once
they know that we are just fighting our

00:01:22.797 --> 00:01:28.228
ignorance, they'll give it up, it's nonsense.
It is nonsense and it's not at all joy-giving.

00:01:28.228 --> 00:01:35.197
Your virtues are very joy-giving. If you
know about your chastity or you know about

00:01:35.197 --> 00:01:40.739
your honesty or if you know about your
straight-forwardness, it's very joy-giving.

00:01:40.739 --> 00:01:46.202
You feel so confident, so happy and such
a person never tries to harm anyone, to be

00:01:46.202 --> 00:01:50.907
sarcastic with anyone, such a person is
absolutely free, I should say, because he has

00:01:50.907 --> 00:01:55.620
no bondages of any kind. These are all 
bondages which bind us and we become

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:02.456
jealous and we become greedy, we become
lusty. All this is nonsense. Is to be just

00:02:02.456 --> 00:02:06.815
seen after getting to your Spirit that the light
shows, these are all like snakes, you see,

00:02:06.815 --> 00:02:11.840
crawling up on us and we are holding on to
the snakes. People when they die, you see,

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:18.000
big, big people I've seen, people tell about them.
In the history they go down as horrible people.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.537
In the history they are described as
people, who were hypocrites, who were

00:02:21.537 --> 00:02:28.942
cruel, who were very, I should say adamant
type and all kinds of things is described.

00:02:28.942 --> 00:02:32.030
Whatever is genuine, remains genuine.
