If you love someone, and you want to take, say,
a rose for a person,

00:14.638 --> 00:18.672
and you go to the market,
with great difficulty you get the rose.

00:18.752 --> 00:20.506
When you get it you feel happy.

00:20.586 --> 00:25.291
But then you get the thorn in the finger,
still you don’t mind.

00:25.371 --> 00:27.183
It’s bleeding, doesn’t matter.

00:27.263 --> 00:30.682
Then you are just waiting to see the person there.

00:30.762 --> 00:37.171
And when you see the person,
you forget all that is gone in between

00:37.252 --> 00:43.279
and you give that rose just
to express yourself, symbolically.

00:43.411 --> 00:47.374
And how happy you feel that you have been able
to give that rose to that person.

00:47.454 --> 00:50.881
This we do every day in our life.

00:50.961 --> 00:57.821
But in Sahaj Yoga you do it
without even knowing it – it’s happening.

00:59.635 --> 01:01.296
You are transmitters.

01:01.376 --> 01:05.731
Everywhere you are sitting in meditation
you are transmitting vibrations.

01:05.811 --> 01:08.146
Do you know that?

01:08.232 --> 01:11.401
At that time if you are thinking of your jobs

01:11.481 --> 01:15.524
and your other things which you have been thinking [about] before,

01:15.604 --> 01:18.841
the transmission is poorer.

01:18.921 --> 01:25.456
Think of love, think of the whole country,
think of the whole world at that time.

01:25.537 --> 01:32.699
You are transmitters of these waves of love,
and love will flow from you.

01:34.805 --> 01:40.099
I told you once that you are made in the form of Ganesha,

01:41.219 --> 01:44.175
and that’s what you have to do.

01:44.256 --> 01:48.525
You know there are vibrations from you coming out,

01:49.159 --> 01:52.913
you are sending vibrations out, you know that.

01:57.101 --> 02:06.578
That means you are like any deity
which is thrown out of the Mother’s,

02:06.811 --> 02:10.424
I mean Earth’s womb,

02:11.210 --> 02:13.556
and a big temple is raised,

02:13.636 --> 02:17.939
and thousands of people go to worship that.

02:18.765 --> 02:26.171
And they say it is a temple of a Jagrut Devata.

02:26.251 --> 02:32.633
‘Jagrut’ means enlightened, awakened.

02:34.027 --> 02:39.510
And that’s just a stone, a stone that comes out

02:39.591 --> 02:45.766
and people build a temple on top of that
and go there and worship that.

02:46.466 --> 02:49.056
While there are so many already sitting here,

02:49.136 --> 02:53.882
so many jagrut, realised-souls.

02:56.252 --> 03:08.013
These are living, these are moving,
these are understanding, they manoeuvre.

03:08.486 --> 03:13.462
The stones only emit vibrations to clear the atmosphere,

03:13.542 --> 03:16.179
but you can raise the Kundalini.
