00:00:08.126 --> 00:00:14.558
If you love someone, and you want to take, say, 
a rose for a person,

00:00:14.638 --> 00:00:18.672
and you go to the market, 
with great difficulty you get the rose.

00:00:18.752 --> 00:00:20.506
When you get it you feel happy.

00:00:20.586 --> 00:00:25.291
But then you get the thorn in the finger, 
still you don’t mind.

00:00:25.371 --> 00:00:27.183
It’s bleeding, doesn’t matter.

00:00:27.263 --> 00:00:30.682
Then you are just waiting to see the person there.

00:00:30.762 --> 00:00:37.171
And when you see the person, 
you forget all that is gone in between

00:00:37.252 --> 00:00:43.279
and you give that rose just 
to express yourself, symbolically.

00:00:43.411 --> 00:00:47.374
And how happy you feel that you have been able 
to give that rose to that person.

00:00:47.454 --> 00:00:50.881
This we do every day in our life.

00:00:50.961 --> 00:00:57.821
But in Sahaj Yoga you do it 
without even knowing it – it’s happening.

00:00:59.635 --> 00:01:01.296
You are transmitters.

00:01:01.376 --> 00:01:05.731
Everywhere you are sitting in meditation 
you are transmitting vibrations.

00:01:05.811 --> 00:01:08.146
Do you know that?

00:01:08.232 --> 00:01:11.401
At that time if you are thinking of your jobs

00:01:11.481 --> 00:01:15.524
and your other things which you have been thinking [about] before,

00:01:15.604 --> 00:01:18.841
the transmission is poorer.

00:01:18.921 --> 00:01:25.456
Think of love, think of the whole country, 
think of the whole world at that time.

00:01:25.537 --> 00:01:32.699
You are transmitters of these waves of love, 
and love will flow from you.

00:01:34.805 --> 00:01:40.099
I told you once that you are made in the form of Ganesha,

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:44.175
and that’s what you have to do.

00:01:44.256 --> 00:01:48.525
You know there are vibrations from you coming out,

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:52.913
you are sending vibrations out, you know that.

00:01:57.101 --> 00:02:06.578
That means you are like any deity 
which is thrown out of the Mother’s,

00:02:06.811 --> 00:02:10.424
I mean Earth’s womb,

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.556
and a big temple is raised,

00:02:13.636 --> 00:02:17.939
and thousands of people go to worship that.

00:02:18.765 --> 00:02:26.171
And they say it is a temple of a Jagrut Devata.

00:02:26.251 --> 00:02:32.633
‘Jagrut’ means enlightened, awakened.

00:02:34.027 --> 00:02:39.510
And that’s just a stone, a stone that comes out

00:02:39.591 --> 00:02:45.766
and people build a temple on top of that 
and go there and worship that.

00:02:46.466 --> 00:02:49.056
While there are so many already sitting here,

00:02:49.136 --> 00:02:53.882
so many jagrut, realised-souls.

00:02:56.252 --> 00:03:08.013
These are living, these are moving, 
these are understanding, they manoeuvre.

00:03:08.486 --> 00:03:13.462
The stones only emit vibrations to clear the atmosphere,

00:03:13.542 --> 00:03:16.179
but you can raise the Kundalini.
