1
00:00:03,068 --> 00:00:09,922
For the last so many lectures, we have been saying

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,136
that you cannot pay for God’s love.

3
00:00:14,136 --> 00:00:18,892
It makes me laugh sometimes.

4
00:00:19,868 --> 00:00:24,868
Human beings can never understand his love,

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,720
because they live in a very limited sphere.

6
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,651
His love is unlimited. His forgiveness is unlimited.

7
00:00:32,651 --> 00:00:40,413
Even this word “unlimited” and “infinite”, we do not understand

8
00:00:40,508 --> 00:00:44,308
because we have not known anything like that.

9
00:00:44,308 --> 00:00:46,428
And to say that something is genuine

10
00:00:46,948 --> 00:00:49,468
is also like certifying something that is genuine.

11
00:00:49,948 --> 00:00:51,800
You don’t need a certificate.

12
00:00:51,868 --> 00:00:55,043
Even that human beings don't understand.

13
00:00:56,388 --> 00:01:01,368
We live with artificiality,

14
00:01:01,988 --> 00:01:05,228
we try to find the truth,

15
00:01:05,228 --> 00:01:08,268
again we accept artificiality as truth.

16
00:01:08,828 --> 00:01:10,760
Again we go on fighting.

17
00:01:10,868 --> 00:01:13,348
Then we think this is the truth.

18
00:01:14,108 --> 00:01:16,774
Again that turns out to be something, artificial thing

19
00:01:16,774 --> 00:01:20,018
or some sort of a mental projection.

20
00:01:20,308 --> 00:01:27,611
All these limited endeavours of human beings

21
00:01:27,611 --> 00:01:31,200
and the experiences they have,

22
00:01:31,308 --> 00:01:35,948
made him so conditioned,

23
00:01:35,948 --> 00:01:41,747
that it is not easy to understand God.

24
00:01:42,188 --> 00:01:47,844
He made all this universe in his compassion and love.

25
00:01:47,844 --> 00:01:51,732
He created you as human beings, also in his compassion and love.

26
00:01:51,732 --> 00:01:53,492
He doesn’t need anything.

27
00:01:54,068 --> 00:01:56,108
But he loves.

28
00:01:57,028 --> 00:02:03,858
And you can’t understand a person who loves beyond any reason,

29
00:02:04,148 --> 00:02:11,139
without any reward, just love because for love’s sake.

30
00:02:11,388 --> 00:02:18,988
We can’t think of one human being like that, who can love only for love’s sake.

31
00:02:18,988 --> 00:02:24,157
Only after Realization, as you grow more and more,

32
00:02:24,157 --> 00:02:30,377
you realise that loving is the greatest joy.

33
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,868
And then, you cannot think of money in relation to him.

34
00:02:35,068 --> 00:02:39,348
It's something, you'll say but, I think,

35
00:02:39,948 --> 00:02:44,240
even to say this, "We don't need money or we don't take money"

36
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:48,842
itself is so low level.

37
00:02:49,268 --> 00:02:53,800
It's so, so much gross.

38
00:02:54,948 --> 00:03:01,466
Because money and all these concepts are your own.

39
00:03:02,268 --> 00:03:06,874
He didn't make this world to get any fruits out of it.

40
00:03:07,188 --> 00:03:08,828
Nothing.

41
00:03:09,228 --> 00:03:11,348
He just made it because he loved.

42
00:03:11,828 --> 00:03:13,028
He wanted to express His Love.

43
00:03:13,228 --> 00:03:16,679
Just to manifest that Love, he made this world.

44
00:03:16,948 --> 00:03:18,868
There’s nothing else expected

45
00:03:19,068 --> 00:03:24,148
and to put the human mind at that level is an impossibility, I find, in the beginning.

46
00:03:24,148 --> 00:03:28,908
But gradually they start understanding how forgiving he is,

47
00:03:28,908 --> 00:03:32,268
how kind he is, how nice he is.

48
00:03:32,268 --> 00:03:35,948
So the first problem I have to face in the West always

49
00:03:35,948 --> 00:03:40,068
even in Paris this was the problem that I faced

50
00:03:40,068 --> 00:03:45,305
was that human beings feel guilty.

51
00:03:45,868 --> 00:03:48,948
And this guilt is such a big problem in the West,

52
00:03:49,148 --> 00:03:50,948
I just don't understand.

53
00:03:51,188 --> 00:03:52,948
You see, why do you feel guilty so much,

54
00:03:53,148 --> 00:03:56,068
as that is one of the hurdles of Sahaja Yoga, I've seen,

55
00:03:56,268 --> 00:03:58,148
that people start feeling guilty.

56
00:03:58,348 --> 00:03:59,908
To such an extent,

57
00:04:00,108 --> 00:04:03,188
that they don't believe that they can get Realization.

58
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:06,948
They think they are sinners born outright,

59
00:04:07,188 --> 00:04:10,348
permanently, branded as 'sinners',

60
00:04:11,148 --> 00:04:13,828
and they can never take their Realization.

61
00:04:14,028 --> 00:04:15,988
I mean, just they brand themselves.

62
00:04:16,268 --> 00:04:17,908
It's beyond self pity also,

63
00:04:18,108 --> 00:04:22,268
I would say it's even self-destructive.

64
00:04:22,268 --> 00:04:25,868
Today, I've taken up this subject of Left Vishuddhi,

65
00:04:26,068 --> 00:04:30,108
because I felt that I must one day speak on this subject,

66
00:04:30,308 --> 00:04:33,028
that this is absolutely,

67
00:04:34,348 --> 00:04:41,116
not inteligible to God that you are guilty. For what?

68
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:45,148
Guilty for what are you?

69
00:04:45,348 --> 00:04:48,148
If you ask yourself, you'll say, "Oh, we are guilty,

70
00:04:48,348 --> 00:04:50,948
because we've crucified Christ" at the most.

71
00:04:51,148 --> 00:04:54,868
That is the maximum guilt a human being, let's say, on his head.

72
00:04:55,068 --> 00:05:02,728
"We crucified Christ, we tortured all the saints". All right.

73
00:05:03,388 --> 00:05:07,348
But by being guilty what do you get?

74
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:11,148
Do you get Him back, can you go back and correct that situation?

75
00:05:11,348 --> 00:05:13,948
You cannot.

76
00:05:13,948 --> 00:05:18,148
But harping upon that, you do get into your subconscious mind.

77
00:05:18,148 --> 00:05:25,792
You get into a position where you are no more normal to receive the Love of God.

78
00:05:26,068 --> 00:05:29,028
You recede into a corner of your mind,

79
00:05:29,228 --> 00:05:30,948
which is darkness,

80
00:05:31,148 --> 00:05:33,348
which is ignorant, which is blindness,

81
00:05:34,188 --> 00:05:37,348
where you cannot receive that beautiful reign,

82
00:05:38,268 --> 00:05:44,747
that eternal flow that's coming in.

83
00:05:45,188 --> 00:05:47,828
You hide yourself, at the back,

84
00:05:48,028 --> 00:05:49,788
and then you say,

85
00:05:49,988 --> 00:05:51,348
"What about the sun?

86
00:05:51,988 --> 00:05:57,409
I cannot receive it because I don't deserve it."

87
00:05:58,948 --> 00:06:02,195
Behind all this ego orientation in the West -

88
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:07,268
Oh, I think, I wish they were purely egoistical. They are not.

89
00:06:07,268 --> 00:06:14,104
All this ego recedes bac ,into that little pouch, what we call the 'guilt'.

90
00:06:15,148 --> 00:06:17,988
You say something to someone.

91
00:06:17,988 --> 00:06:20,388
It's saying that point, that stage,

92
00:06:20,868 --> 00:06:24,650
that, "I've said it. All right, I've said it. I can take the responsability, i's good."

93
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,028
Not that.

94
00:06:26,028 --> 00:06:31,108
But you come back home, "Oh, I should not have said that".

95
00:06:31,108 --> 00:06:36,597
So you wobble between one kind of action into another kind,

96
00:06:36,868 --> 00:06:39,468
from say, into an aggressive

97
00:06:39,948 --> 00:06:43,228
to another one of a receding type

98
00:06:43,228 --> 00:06:45,348
And this wobbling really,

99
00:06:46,028 --> 00:06:48,108
is very, very troublesome.

100
00:06:48,308 --> 00:06:50,188
It can go on too much.

101
00:06:50,388 --> 00:06:52,868
The oscilation could be so much.

102
00:06:53,108 --> 00:06:56,068
that it can make you absolutely frantic,

103
00:06:56,268 --> 00:07:02,406
diffident, and sometimes, useless.

104
00:07:04,948 --> 00:07:06,868
On the contrary,

105
00:07:07,268 --> 00:07:09,268
God wants to find human beings,

106
00:07:09,828 --> 00:07:11,108
who are cheerful people,

107
00:07:11,308 --> 00:07:13,068
who are happy people,

108
00:07:13,268 --> 00:07:15,868
who are thankful to Him for His blessings.

109
00:07:18,268 --> 00:07:21,428
The most unhappy animal in this world,

110
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:24,774
is the human being, can you believe that?

111
00:07:25,348 --> 00:07:29,188
Animals, don't know happiness and unhappiness, also a good point is.

112
00:07:31,308 --> 00:07:33,268
But the most unhappy human being,

113
00:07:33,468 --> 00:07:36,068
and the most complicated human being,

114
00:07:36,948 --> 00:07:40,028
has become so over you see, self-destructive,

115
00:07:40,028 --> 00:07:43,124
that a destruction force is built within himself.

116
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,433
Now think of that force that has built you up into a human

117
00:07:50,948 --> 00:07:53,068
how with care and love,

118
00:07:53,268 --> 00:07:56,068
without your knowledge, without troubling you.

119
00:07:56,268 --> 00:07:59,108
Even when you were born you never knew what was the pain,

120
00:07:59,308 --> 00:08:02,268
of the birth. Your mother took over it.

121
00:08:02,268 --> 00:08:04,988
He's made you a human being

122
00:08:04,988 --> 00:08:10,185
so carefully, delicately he's built you up.

123
00:08:11,028 --> 00:08:12,348
For what?

124
00:08:12,988 --> 00:08:17,326
What is the fruit of this beautiful flower?

125
00:08:18,348 --> 00:08:20,148
Why the flower starts hitting itself?

126
00:08:20,348 --> 00:08:23,478
Have you ever heard of anyone like that?

127
00:08:25,268 --> 00:08:27,828
This is the worst disease, which

128
00:08:28,348 --> 00:08:31,428
we in the West suffer.

129
00:08:33,108 --> 00:08:35,068
French yes,

130
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,228
we had at least double the number of people

131
00:08:37,428 --> 00:08:39,268
that we have here today, surprisingly.

132
00:08:39,468 --> 00:08:41,988
But, also they have the same problem.

133
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:45,308
And I think all their psychologists,

134
00:08:46,508 --> 00:08:48,508
psychoanalists,

135
00:08:49,268 --> 00:08:52,428
or we can say the, all the books,

136
00:08:52,868 --> 00:08:55,028
all the writers, the philosophers,

137
00:08:55,228 --> 00:08:59,216
everyone has done to them.

138
00:08:59,988 --> 00:09:02,348
They have given these ideas,

139
00:09:02,988 --> 00:09:05,148
and everybody accepts them.

140
00:09:05,908 --> 00:09:09,108
And they curse themselves morning till evening,

141
00:09:09,988 --> 00:09:12,868
walking with so many wrinkles on the forehead.

142
00:09:13,468 --> 00:09:15,148
When you ask them, they will say,

143
00:09:15,348 --> 00:09:17,908
"Mother we are very unhappy people".

144
00:09:18,268 --> 00:09:25,291
It's like asking unhappiness to come and decorate you.

145
00:09:26,348 --> 00:09:34,479
But it has a subtler meaning of which people are not aware.

146
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:37,348
These are the times,

147
00:09:38,348 --> 00:09:41,108
when you have to get your Realization.

148
00:09:41,348 --> 00:09:43,828
This mass Realization has to work out.

149
00:09:44,028 --> 00:09:45,868
It's all prophesized,

150
00:09:46,148 --> 00:09:48,954
and very important times are these.

151
00:09:49,428 --> 00:09:52,188
All the stars are acting to help us.

152
00:09:53,028 --> 00:09:55,188
The whole universe is helping us.

153
00:09:56,348 --> 00:09:58,468
All the elements are helping us.

154
00:09:58,988 --> 00:10:02,077
We are on the stage.

155
00:10:03,268 --> 00:10:05,868
But when the actors arrive on the stage,

156
00:10:05,868 --> 00:10:07,948
they are finished, they can't act.

157
00:10:08,188 --> 00:10:10,948
They can't do anything, they can't play their game.

158
00:10:11,268 --> 00:10:14,988
They are so involved with their different roles.

159
00:10:18,228 --> 00:10:21,268
And that is why one has to understand the subtler effect of it,

160
00:10:21,468 --> 00:10:23,828
then only you will get rid of this guilt.

161
00:10:24,028 --> 00:10:28,317
You are playing into the hands of negative forces.

162
00:10:29,068 --> 00:10:35,068
They are not less than any atomic bombs,

163
00:10:35,068 --> 00:10:36,908
built within yourselves.

164
00:10:37,948 --> 00:10:39,468
Now what is the way it works out,

165
00:10:39,908 --> 00:10:41,788
I think people do not realize it.

166
00:10:41,988 --> 00:10:44,108
It's a very subtle method.

167
00:10:44,348 --> 00:10:45,948
Let's see the atomic bomb,

168
00:10:46,148 --> 00:10:50,196
hidrogen bomb, what will you do there?

169
00:10:51,348 --> 00:10:54,348
They will separate something which should not be separated.

170
00:10:57,148 --> 00:11:02,188
We break atom, which is not divisible,

171
00:11:02,188 --> 00:11:04,633
into its divisible parts.

172
00:11:05,228 --> 00:11:11,468
So we put a pressure to break them.

173
00:11:11,468 --> 00:11:13,948
And when that breaking force,

174
00:11:14,148 --> 00:11:15,988
that aggression I would say,

175
00:11:16,188 --> 00:11:18,188
is worked out,

176
00:11:19,508 --> 00:11:23,108
that becomes another destructive force.

177
00:11:24,988 --> 00:11:28,028
So whatever effort we have put into that,

178
00:11:28,268 --> 00:11:31,468
multiplies, it's not the same force.

179
00:11:33,348 --> 00:11:37,134
And that we use for our destruction.

180
00:11:37,134 --> 00:11:42,162
I mean, this only human being can do, 
to create things to destroy himself.

181
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:46,148
But this force, which works within our minds,

182
00:11:46,348 --> 00:11:48,228
within ourselves, within our being,

183
00:11:48,428 --> 00:11:52,188
where we actually really hate ourselves sometimes I feel,

184
00:11:52,388 --> 00:11:54,868
the way we are destroying ourselves,

185
00:11:56,068 --> 00:11:57,468
this force

186
00:11:58,068 --> 00:12:00,428
we build within ourselves thanks to  many

187
00:12:00,828 --> 00:12:03,108
nonsensical writers and conditioners

188
00:12:03,308 --> 00:12:07,675
and people who talk of conditioning really condition you much worse!

189
00:12:08,068 --> 00:12:10,428
You should be singing and chanting like a bird.

190
00:12:11,428 --> 00:12:14,228
You should be laughing and enjoying like a flower.

191
00:12:15,108 --> 00:12:17,108
But I find human beings faces,

192
00:12:17,308 --> 00:12:20,228
all, looking so very unhappy.

193
00:12:21,348 --> 00:12:23,228
What's the reason?

194
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:29,582
The reason is you are separated from your own being,

195
00:12:30,268 --> 00:12:35,148
the being that integrates you. You are completely disintegrated.

196
00:12:35,148 --> 00:12:42,148
When you disintegrate the hidrogen atom

197
00:12:42,148 --> 00:12:45,108
you form a very big force built into it.

198
00:12:45,428 --> 00:12:51,388
In the same way, you are the disintegrating your being:

199
00:12:51,388 --> 00:12:55,148
your physical being on one side, your mental being on another side,

200
00:12:55,348 --> 00:13:00,622
your spiritual being on another side, there's no integrating point.

201
00:13:01,228 --> 00:13:05,610
And when you cannot feel that integration,

202
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:07,188
you feel guilty,

203
00:13:07,388 --> 00:13:10,068
but that guilt is just a symptom of

204
00:13:10,268 --> 00:13:15,000
a very big destructive force built in you.

205
00:13:16,348 --> 00:13:22,640
This is the way we are going to destroy ourselves.

206
00:13:23,268 --> 00:13:24,948
No other way.

207
00:13:25,148 --> 00:13:27,828
Our destruction is not going to come to us from outside.

208
00:13:28,028 --> 00:13:29,908
That can be controlled.

209
00:13:30,868 --> 00:13:36,277
It's going to come from within, within ourselves.

210
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:40,348
Everything we do now, after disintegration,

211
00:13:41,108 --> 00:13:49,789
is further disintegration 
or further building up that negative force within us.

212
00:13:51,508 --> 00:13:55,739
But to integrate it,

213
00:13:56,308 --> 00:14:00,348
to make you feel complete integration with all your being,

214
00:14:01,908 --> 00:14:04,068
it's only possible

215
00:14:04,828 --> 00:14:06,508
if you can somehow or other

216
00:14:06,948 --> 00:14:08,868
get to that integrating force

217
00:14:09,068 --> 00:14:15,000
which is still there and is quite deep.

218
00:14:18,348 --> 00:14:22,228
That's the last chance, I would say now, that has to work.

219
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:25,428
The way the negative forces have set in motion

220
00:14:26,068 --> 00:14:29,148
of which you may not be aware at all, you may not be aware,

221
00:14:29,348 --> 00:14:33,348
you don't know what darkness is there.

222
00:14:35,028 --> 00:14:39,908
And to fight it, what one has to do

223
00:14:40,068 --> 00:14:45,808
is to bring that light of the Spirit,
which integrates.

224
00:14:46,388 --> 00:14:48,348
Darkness always disintegrates you.

225
00:14:48,908 --> 00:14:51,228
For example, there's complete darkness, all right,

226
00:14:51,428 --> 00:14:54,428
I can't feel you, I don't know who you are, where you are sitting.

227
00:14:54,988 --> 00:14:56,268
We are all separate.

228
00:14:56,468 --> 00:14:59,888
I can't see you, I don't know who you people are there.

229
00:15:00,028 --> 00:15:02,868
I wouldn't know where is the window, where is the door.

230
00:15:03,428 --> 00:15:06,068
I'll hold this and say, "This is the truth".

231
00:15:07,308 --> 00:15:11,248
All disintegrated personalities,
and disintegrated people,

232
00:15:11,908 --> 00:15:14,268
always see aberrations. They see different things,

233
00:15:14,468 --> 00:15:16,348
different auras, different things.

234
00:15:19,468 --> 00:15:23,468
Now, it's a very vicious circle.
You just think of it.

235
00:15:24,148 --> 00:15:28,848
It's a very great vicious circle we have.

236
00:15:29,348 --> 00:15:38,388
The vicious circle is that we try to think about it,

237
00:15:38,388 --> 00:15:40,148
which is limited.

238
00:15:40,348 --> 00:15:43,388
Supposing I have a limited vision, there's darkness

239
00:15:44,028 --> 00:15:46,759
what will I feel?

240
00:15:47,908 --> 00:15:52,388
You start thinking about it and thinking about it,
pondering over it.

241
00:15:52,468 --> 00:15:58,255
The more you think about it, the worse it becomes.

242
00:16:01,108 --> 00:16:04,868
Another way could be people may try to solve this problem,

243
00:16:05,268 --> 00:16:07,888
to think that we are disintegrated,

244
00:16:08,068 --> 00:16:12,388
is to talk of big things, "We are all brothers and sisters,

245
00:16:12,428 --> 00:16:14,948
let's form U.N. counseling,

246
00:16:15,428 --> 00:16:19,108
let's do world organization".

247
00:16:19,348 --> 00:16:22,788
All blind people doing world organization will end up

248
00:16:22,988 --> 00:16:30,523
at the most, as a labour, what you call, labour department.

249
00:16:30,523 --> 00:16:32,868
That's all.

250
00:16:33,388 --> 00:16:40,428
With all these institutions 
working in the big name,

251
00:16:41,428 --> 00:16:43,068
where are we?

252
00:16:43,508 --> 00:16:50,508
Actually, when we become aware, we don't need them.

253
00:16:50,508 --> 00:16:53,779
We don't need at all.

254
00:16:54,988 --> 00:16:57,908
So, this awareness is nothing but

255
00:16:58,108 --> 00:17:02,380
the light of the Spirit within you which is missing.

256
00:17:02,908 --> 00:17:05,068
The Spirit is watching you, all right.

257
00:17:05,268 --> 00:17:06,908
It goes up to a point

258
00:17:07,108 --> 00:17:11,868
to see your stupidity and your limitedness.

259
00:17:13,188 --> 00:17:18,908
And it goes up to a very great extent, I should say,
where it's finished.

260
00:17:19,028 --> 00:17:22,148
It disappears and a person dies,

261
00:17:22,428 --> 00:17:25,188
or he gets into trouble, he becomes creazy, mad,

262
00:17:25,388 --> 00:17:26,828
whatever you may call him.

263
00:17:27,028 --> 00:17:32,888
He develops other diseases like cancer,

264
00:17:33,028 --> 00:17:38,908
which are caused by another problem here, 
as you know, Ekadesha.

265
00:17:39,508 --> 00:17:47,895
So, these forces are built within us, of negativity,

266
00:17:47,895 --> 00:17:52,842
 
when we go to the extremes of negativity.

267
00:17:53,388 --> 00:17:55,508
So, in the Kundalini shastra,

268
00:17:55,988 --> 00:18:01,833
we can say that the left and right side
when used too much,

269
00:18:02,948 --> 00:18:09,268
you build up these forces in the head of eleven Rudras,
the eleven distructive forces.

270
00:18:09,268 --> 00:18:12,068
A cancer patient develops it.

271
00:18:12,268 --> 00:18:16,148
But even before developing cancer,
people can develop it.

272
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:22,988
And there are so many things,
that can create this,

273
00:18:23,348 --> 00:18:27,028
that sometimes one would feel, 
in this vicious circle

274
00:18:27,228 --> 00:18:31,477
that, "How are you going to patch up the whole society?"

275
00:18:31,868 --> 00:18:40,188
And there's only one thing,
that will save the situation, it's Self-realization.

276
00:18:42,228 --> 00:18:51,348
All other things are destroying, are absolutely confusing.

277
00:18:51,868 --> 00:18:55,437
But there's only one thing if you can do,

278
00:18:55,437 --> 00:19:00,527
it saves the whole thing, like putting on the light, finished!

279
00:19:01,868 --> 00:19:07,228
But people don't understand the importance of Self-realization,

280
00:19:07,228 --> 00:19:12,060
 because some people ask me, "What's the use of getting the cool breeze in the hand?"

281
00:19:12,428 --> 00:19:15,988
Now, see the big canvas of the whole thing, the whole cosmos,

282
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,034
in a jeopardy.

283
00:19:18,034 --> 00:19:22,028
See what's happening to human beings today.

284
00:19:22,028 --> 00:19:27,308
And if they are to be saved, no use being unhappy.

285
00:19:27,308 --> 00:19:32,228
Like in France they said, "You cannot, Mother, say you are very happy person".

286
00:19:32,228 --> 00:19:34,013
I said, "Why?"

287
00:19:34,013 --> 00:19:40,649
"Because that means you are ignorant of the shocks."

288
00:19:41,028 --> 00:19:43,828
You see, I have to say  "I am very unhappy", you see.

289
00:19:44,028 --> 00:19:46,108
I have to paint some lines here to show you,

290
00:19:46,308 --> 00:19:48,788
that I'm very deeply concerned,

291
00:19:48,988 --> 00:19:52,868
worried about the whole world.

292
00:19:52,868 --> 00:19:55,348
But what is the solution have you got?

293
00:19:56,348 --> 00:19:58,908
You want me to be like you only?

294
00:19:59,268 --> 00:20:00,948
Is that the solution?

295
00:20:00,948 --> 00:20:03,988
That if ten people are weeping you also join them weeping?

296
00:20:04,188 --> 00:20:07,563
Is that the solution?

297
00:20:09,188 --> 00:20:15,468
And the one and only method that we have

298
00:20:16,428 --> 00:20:19,868
which has been already told and prescribed

299
00:20:19,948 --> 00:20:23,348
and has been prophesized,

300
00:20:24,428 --> 00:20:28,068
nobody seeks it.
No one seeks it.

301
00:20:28,428 --> 00:20:30,948
See now, in the Bible: you have to be born again,

302
00:20:31,148 --> 00:20:32,988
Christ is to be born in your heart.

303
00:20:33,188 --> 00:20:35,508
I mean, they do it, even before solving the whole drama

304
00:20:35,948 --> 00:20:38,068
they do it by giving you the second birth,

305
00:20:38,268 --> 00:20:40,868
by Christening you, so called.

306
00:20:42,108 --> 00:20:44,988
Hindus they believe without yoga is there's no sense.

307
00:20:45,188 --> 00:20:47,908
"Yoga kshema vahamyam" Krishna said all the time that,

308
00:20:48,108 --> 00:20:49,188
"You seek yoga". What are you seeking?

309
00:20:49,388 --> 00:20:51,388
All these treatises and all these big books

310
00:20:51,828 --> 00:20:54,828
and all the scriptures are aiming at what?

311
00:20:55,148 --> 00:20:59,158
Even, those who talked, "You must live with dharma
you must live a balanced life"

312
00:20:59,158 --> 00:21:01,908
For what? Why do you do it?

313
00:21:02,348 --> 00:21:03,868
What is the destination?

314
00:21:04,188 --> 00:21:07,348
And the destination is the Spirit.

315
00:21:08,108 --> 00:21:15,048
And today the background is so black, 
is so dark,

316
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:21,848
that this solution is
the end of everything.

317
00:21:22,268 --> 00:21:25,828
But do we realize this?

318
00:21:26,348 --> 00:21:31,308
On the contrary, the vicious circle builts in, within us,
all the time.

319
00:21:31,348 --> 00:21:35,348
"Oh, see how the world is miserable.

320
00:21:35,348 --> 00:21:38,357
Then how can I be happy?

321
00:21:40,308 --> 00:21:42,108
I'm so unhappy in life."

322
00:21:42,308 --> 00:21:45,000
I have yet to come across a person before Realization

323
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,720
saying that, "I am a happy person".

324
00:21:49,348 --> 00:21:53,413
Maybe ego-oriented people might say, "I'm happy", 
meaning "my ego is".

325
00:21:53,413 --> 00:21:56,245
You see, if he goes in a swanky car, or something like that,

326
00:21:56,245 --> 00:21:58,988
he's very happy, on top of the world.

327
00:21:59,148 --> 00:22:03,808
After ten minutes, you see him [looking sad]

328
00:22:04,308 --> 00:22:06,868
and this vicious circle is set in.

329
00:22:07,068 --> 00:22:10,848
This ego-oriented circle, or another one, it sets in.

330
00:22:11,028 --> 00:22:13,788
Another vicious circle and another vicious circle

331
00:22:13,988 --> 00:22:16,300
and another vicious circle,

332
00:22:16,308 --> 00:22:18,348
we go on from one to another,

333
00:22:18,348 --> 00:22:22,077
moving on the wheels after wheels,

334
00:22:23,028 --> 00:22:30,028
without realizing that, "Where we are going?"

335
00:22:32,068 --> 00:22:38,888
And this vicious circle has to be broken by one faith,

336
00:22:38,888 --> 00:22:45,308
by one understanding, that God is forgiveness.

337
00:22:45,308 --> 00:22:49,245
God is Love.

338
00:22:50,348 --> 00:22:54,868
When we feel love for anyone, without any lust and greed,

339
00:22:54,868 --> 00:22:59,248
then that is God’s love within us.

340
00:23:00,188 --> 00:23:06,841
That he is the embodiment of that pure love,

341
00:23:07,348 --> 00:23:11,148
which just loves,

342
00:23:11,148 --> 00:23:14,056
which has given you this beautiful human life

343
00:23:14,056 --> 00:23:17,885
and wants to make you more beautiful.

344
00:23:18,868 --> 00:23:21,308
He created all this creation for you

345
00:23:21,868 --> 00:23:26,580
and that he wants you to enjoy the bounties of this creation.

346
00:23:26,988 --> 00:23:29,828
He wants you to enjoy the citizen of his realm

347
00:23:30,028 --> 00:23:35,067
and the Kingdom of his Grace.

348
00:23:37,268 --> 00:23:39,948
Do we go to see someone

349
00:23:39,948 --> 00:23:43,348
who is highly placed, with a morose face? Do we?

350
00:23:44,148 --> 00:23:46,308
That day, we'll specially brush up the hair,

351
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:48,908
see, make our hair into a beautiful thing,

352
00:23:49,108 --> 00:23:52,021
make our face nice, dress up well,

353
00:23:52,021 --> 00:23:54,377
It looks like we are well, you see.

354
00:23:55,348 --> 00:23:57,348
That’s outside.

355
00:23:59,308 --> 00:24:04,440
Inside, if you just feel how kind he is,

356
00:24:06,188 --> 00:24:10,753
how he has worked out meticulously

357
00:24:10,753 --> 00:24:13,753
in this blissful life of a human being.

358
00:24:14,028 --> 00:24:17,755
But think how much he has done for you!

359
00:24:18,028 --> 00:24:20,148
Instead of that, if you are all the time going to say,

360
00:24:20,348 --> 00:24:22,468
“I am very unhappy in life.”

361
00:24:22,908 --> 00:24:25,108
I mean, think of someone who does everything for you

362
00:24:25,308 --> 00:24:26,828
and you can just come back saying,

363
00:24:27,028 --> 00:24:29,108
“Oh, I am a very unhappy person.”

364
00:24:29,308 --> 00:24:30,868
What is he going to feel about it?

365
00:24:31,068 --> 00:24:32,868
No gratitude.

366
00:24:33,228 --> 00:24:36,498
Count your blessings one by one.

367
00:24:37,108 --> 00:24:38,348
That’s what one has to do,

368
00:24:38,948 --> 00:24:42,959
is to have complete understanding

369
00:24:42,959 --> 00:24:45,811
that he is God Almighty.

370
00:24:45,811 --> 00:24:48,837
He can do anything that he likes.

371
00:24:49,868 --> 00:24:55,459
and we are the recipient of His Allmighty.

372
00:24:56,228 --> 00:24:59,228
He is the Ocean of love,

373
00:24:59,428 --> 00:25:03,348
and we are the recipient of his love.

374
00:25:06,268 --> 00:25:12,565
Let us feel that, within ourselves, and understand logically with wisdom.

375
00:25:13,348 --> 00:25:16,028
If this sets into your mind,

376
00:25:16,228 --> 00:25:19,228
that’s the best conditioning I think human beings can have,

377
00:25:20,828 --> 00:25:22,828
what you call in Sanskrit as  "Susamskara",

378
00:25:23,028 --> 00:25:25,948
means the auspicious conditionings.

379
00:25:26,148 --> 00:25:29,308
You see, we don't have only conditioning and ego.

380
00:25:29,508 --> 00:25:34,482
We have third thing called also good conditioning.

381
00:25:34,988 --> 00:25:39,348
The conditionings that are ruining your chances of enjoyment,

382
00:25:39,908 --> 00:25:42,308
let it be brought round.

383
00:25:44,268 --> 00:25:47,148
And see for yourself, logically you can see

384
00:25:47,348 --> 00:25:51,905
how much is done for you.

385
00:25:54,308 --> 00:25:57,948
I mean none of the animals were that comfortable as you are.

386
00:25:58,148 --> 00:26:00,148
They don't know the idea of comfort. I mean they have never had a car,

387
00:26:00,348 --> 00:26:04,224
even chairs to sit down.

388
00:26:07,268 --> 00:26:10,348
It's easy to say, "Nice to be like animals" you see.

389
00:26:10,348 --> 00:26:12,788
But just go and see the way they live poor things!

390
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:17,673
No. Even the king of the forest, how he lives, one should go and see.

391
00:26:18,388 --> 00:26:22,712
But he's happy. He's full of joy.

392
00:26:23,108 --> 00:26:25,108
Now he has to kill an animal, he'll kill it,

393
00:26:25,308 --> 00:26:28,864
and with his dignity eat one or two days, finished.

394
00:26:29,188 --> 00:26:31,148
Then he lives for ten days without food.

395
00:26:31,348 --> 00:26:34,508
Whenever he feels hungry he goes, he's not bothered.

396
00:26:35,228 --> 00:26:37,272
He doesn't feel guilty for killing anybody,

397
00:26:37,272 --> 00:26:41,144
he is hungry, he has to eat, he eats, finished.

398
00:26:42,468 --> 00:26:44,468
But human beings, as they are,

399
00:26:44,908 --> 00:26:50,468
they will eat someone without the need, and they'll feel guilty.

400
00:26:50,468 --> 00:26:53,884
This is the problem.

401
00:26:56,508 --> 00:26:59,868
He has made you with his own image.

402
00:27:00,068 --> 00:27:03,237
He's done everything beautifully.

403
00:27:03,868 --> 00:27:06,908
After Realization, you start understanding yourself

404
00:27:07,108 --> 00:27:09,988
and enjoying yourself as you enjoy others.

405
00:27:09,988 --> 00:27:13,621
The fragrance of others you start enjoying.

406
00:27:15,188 --> 00:27:21,348
Self-realization is the only way, you can get the light in.

407
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:25,468
Enlightenment. Everybody talks of enlightenment, enlightenment.

408
00:27:25,948 --> 00:27:29,468
Enlightenment, means for some people is that you start jumping.

409
00:27:30,508 --> 00:27:34,348
Is it enlightenement to be abnormal like that? 
Or take out your clothes?

410
00:27:34,348 --> 00:27:36,948
I mean, just think of it, how does it go into your brains,

411
00:27:37,148 --> 00:27:40,713
I can't understand, that doing all these nonsensical things,

412
00:27:40,713 --> 00:27:43,780
how can there be enlightenment?

413
00:27:44,028 --> 00:27:46,108
Or taking to alcohol, drinking or

414
00:27:46,308 --> 00:27:49,068
drugs or anything. How can it give you enlightenment?

415
00:27:49,268 --> 00:27:52,599
Has it given to anyone so far?

416
00:27:53,148 --> 00:27:56,188
It might be some sort of a funny strange experience  you might get,

417
00:27:56,188 --> 00:27:57,428
but not enlightenment.

418
00:27:57,908 --> 00:28:00,068
In enlightenment, you get integrated,

419
00:28:00,268 --> 00:28:02,788
you see your way through, you know where you are standing

420
00:28:02,988 --> 00:28:06,028
and how you are moving in relationship to others.

421
00:28:08,948 --> 00:28:14,570
So the illogical method, I would say, unwise method,

422
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:27,751
 the way we deal with life, becomes a kind of a possession.

423
00:28:29,988 --> 00:28:35,148
And we are possessed by this negative force which is eating us up.

424
00:28:35,148 --> 00:28:39,468
And we go on living with that idea, enjoing that idea,

425
00:28:39,468 --> 00:28:44,118
that, we are miserable people, we are unhappy, we are helpless.

426
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:47,099
I mean, I've seen people sitting on the streets and discussing,

427
00:28:47,099 --> 00:28:50,870
 "Oh, thank God, there's going to be 8 stars coming in and we'll be all destroyed".

428
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:54,910
 I mean just imagine!

429
00:28:56,228 --> 00:28:59,228
But we have to think about the One who has created us.

430
00:28:59,428 --> 00:29:03,388
Is he waiting for your destruction, will he be happy with that?

431
00:29:05,868 --> 00:29:09,419
How much are you cooperating with Him?

432
00:29:09,988 --> 00:29:15,000
With what care, love, he has created us?

433
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,674
 With what hopes whatever it is,

434
00:29:16,674 --> 00:29:17,988
what does he want to do for us

435
00:29:18,268 --> 00:29:20,348
that you are sitting down and feeling guilty?

436
00:29:20,868 --> 00:29:23,068
And now, I have to tell openly,

437
00:29:23,268 --> 00:29:27,580
that it has come to you also through other vechicles,

438
00:29:28,188 --> 00:29:32,654
apart from the psychologists, psychoanalysts.

439
00:29:32,908 --> 00:29:35,308
Psychoanalysts: the other day we had a girl,

440
00:29:35,508 --> 00:29:36,948
she came to see Me.

441
00:29:37,148 --> 00:29:40,148
She's French. Her English was wonderful,

442
00:29:40,428 --> 00:29:41,828
and she said,

443
00:29:42,028 --> 00:29:45,068
"Horrible psychologists! They make me mad."

444
00:29:45,268 --> 00:29:48,108
"Why?" They said, "I have bad relationship with my mother,

445
00:29:48,308 --> 00:29:49,948
I have bad relationship with my father,

446
00:29:50,148 --> 00:29:52,028
bad relationship with every third person".

447
00:29:52,228 --> 00:29:54,308
I don't have that, I've absolutely pure relationship.

448
00:29:54,508 --> 00:29:56,308
They try to put that idea into my head

449
00:29:56,508 --> 00:29:58,908
that there's something abnormal, pathological about me

450
00:29:59,108 --> 00:30:01,055
which I am not!

451
00:30:01,308 --> 00:30:04,795
And they are making my brother's relationship also funny

452
00:30:04,795 --> 00:30:08,298
by telling him that I have bad relations with him.

453
00:30:09,188 --> 00:30:10,893
This is it.

454
00:30:11,228 --> 00:30:13,268
So they hit at the point of pure love,

455
00:30:13,468 --> 00:30:15,188
desintegrate you.

456
00:30:15,388 --> 00:30:18,148
You can't have good relationship with your own mother,

457
00:30:18,348 --> 00:30:22,453
with your own father, with your own sister, with your brother, and nobody.

458
00:30:22,453 --> 00:30:25,068
Because you cannot love except for, you are sex points.

459
00:30:25,268 --> 00:30:26,948
You have just relationship of sex.

460
00:30:26,948 --> 00:30:29,148
Even animals have better relationship then we have,

461
00:30:29,348 --> 00:30:31,428
if you have to accept the psychologists.

462
00:30:32,908 --> 00:30:37,268
And they take money to suggest
all these nonsensical ideas into your head.

463
00:30:37,268 --> 00:30:40,733
There are some here sitting. I will face them later on.

464
00:30:42,868 --> 00:30:45,788
This is how they're putting ideas into your heads

465
00:30:45,988 --> 00:30:50,988
that, "You are a person who has no, no purity

466
00:30:50,988 --> 00:30:52,388
and that you are a sinner,

467
00:30:52,828 --> 00:30:56,148
you are a damned person and any person you look upon,

468
00:30:56,348 --> 00:30:59,148
you have only sex relationships, nothing else.

469
00:30:59,348 --> 00:31:02,316
I mean are we sex points?

470
00:31:02,988 --> 00:31:06,964
With all this evolution God has made us into a sex point:

471
00:31:06,964 --> 00:31:12,929
that's what we have done to ourselves, reduced ourselves to that point only.

472
00:31:14,348 --> 00:31:18,228
He has created you in your own glory and in your own dignity.

473
00:31:20,988 --> 00:31:22,228
He's not created you

474
00:31:22,428 --> 00:31:25,868
to be only wasted like this

475
00:31:26,108 --> 00:31:29,828
Then the second thing that disintegrates us very much more,

476
00:31:30,348 --> 00:31:38,557
is the idea that we are here, you see, 
to live in a gross way,

477
00:31:38,988 --> 00:31:43,228
somehow fighting, political, economic,

478
00:31:44,028 --> 00:31:49,308
all these nonsensical progress that we are making.

479
00:31:49,988 --> 00:31:54,290
And everything is explained,
all destructive forces are explained

480
00:31:54,543 --> 00:31:58,148
in the name of political or economic growth.

481
00:31:58,868 --> 00:32:03,108
I don't know if it is 'growth' or whatever it is,

482
00:32:03,188 --> 00:32:06,068
but definetely it is not love, take it from me.

483
00:32:06,268 --> 00:32:09,268
It is not love.

484
00:32:09,508 --> 00:32:14,848
That's why economics of God is to be understood.

485
00:32:15,148 --> 00:32:18,235
Politics of God is to be understood.

486
00:32:18,235 --> 00:32:22,494
And for human beings to understand it, they must have Self-realization.

487
00:32:23,028 --> 00:32:29,808
In his economics, generosity is the key-note.

488
00:32:30,308 --> 00:32:34,399
He enjoys his generosity.

489
00:32:35,228 --> 00:32:41,268
Material things are to express your generosity, isn't it?

490
00:32:42,148 --> 00:32:44,028
What are they for?

491
00:32:44,348 --> 00:32:48,148
The most enjoyable thing is to give,

492
00:32:48,348 --> 00:32:56,348
and when you give, you will see
 your economic problems will be solved completely.

493
00:32:56,348 --> 00:32:59,068
Because you are here to become free,  no problems!

494
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:03,522
The problems are because you want to grab.

495
00:33:05,348 --> 00:33:09,128
And once you start giving, you get it,
as much as you want,

496
00:33:09,128 --> 00:33:14,256
because if there's no outlet, there's no joy,

497
00:33:14,256 --> 00:33:17,176
there's no happiness, there's no release.

498
00:33:17,176 --> 00:33:20,388
from the material domination on you.

499
00:33:20,388 --> 00:33:22,908
But giving is the way

500
00:33:22,908 --> 00:33:26,468
you can get rid of that material domination on your head.

501
00:33:27,188 --> 00:33:29,437
That you give away.

502
00:33:30,868 --> 00:33:32,148
Give away everything that you have

503
00:33:32,348 --> 00:33:36,620
and you'll be surprised how it flows to you.

504
00:33:38,148 --> 00:33:40,988
Now, when I say, "It is fantastic the way it acts.

505
00:33:41,188 --> 00:33:43,108
Fantastic, the way it acts".

506
00:33:43,308 --> 00:33:45,828
Somehow, it’s easy to say,

507
00:33:46,028 --> 00:33:47,868
“It’s Mother is saying something

508
00:33:48,348 --> 00:33:53,148
which is something miraculous.”

509
00:33:53,468 --> 00:33:57,828
But what do you think of Moses 
crossing the river, crossing the sea?

510
00:33:58,028 --> 00:33:59,828
You mean, it was miraculous,

511
00:34:00,028 --> 00:34:05,220
or it was a false stoy or what do you think of it?

512
00:34:06,028 --> 00:34:08,388
It was absolutely true,

513
00:34:08,868 --> 00:34:14,697
that he did cross the sea. With the help of God, he could do it.

514
00:34:16,148 --> 00:34:18,388
What about Christ walking on the water?

515
00:34:18,388 --> 00:34:20,948
He did because by his nature, he did it.

516
00:34:22,028 --> 00:34:25,068
What about all the miracles that were done by this Incarnation?

517
00:34:25,268 --> 00:34:30,802
It's absolutely true, I'm here to prove all of them.

518
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:33,948
But you must get your Realization.

519
00:34:34,148 --> 00:34:36,028
Not because that I cannot prove it,

520
00:34:36,228 --> 00:34:40,268
You must enter into that realm of awareness. 
Otherwise, they cannot prove it.

521
00:34:40,268 --> 00:34:43,028
 It's true. The other day, 
somebody was saying that Rama is a fiction.

522
00:34:43,028 --> 00:34:45,000
I said, "How do you say?"

523
00:34:45,348 --> 00:34:46,988
He said, "Because, it looks like a fiction".

524
00:34:47,188 --> 00:34:50,868
I said, "To human mind, they cannot understand God,

525
00:34:50,868 --> 00:34:55,068
who has millions and millions of hands and eyes

526
00:34:55,068 --> 00:34:57,108
to work out His plans".

527
00:34:57,108 --> 00:35:01,908
So, naturally Rama is a fiction. 
Krishna is a fiction. Everybody is a fiction!

528
00:35:01,908 --> 00:35:06,186
Because we ourselves are fictitious, I think.

529
00:35:07,308 --> 00:35:09,468
It's not that it is a fiction

530
00:35:09,468 --> 00:35:13,228
but we are incapable of grasping that is miraculous, which is divine.

531
00:35:13,428 --> 00:35:15,988
and that's why we just call it, "Oh".

532
00:35:17,348 --> 00:35:21,148
No, everything is true, believe me, everything is true.

533
00:35:21,348 --> 00:35:23,868
Now, Rama' s case, let's take it.

534
00:35:23,868 --> 00:35:25,868
Simple to be like Rama, all right?

535
00:35:26,348 --> 00:35:28,028
"Rama is a fiction".

536
00:35:28,228 --> 00:35:32,348
Many of our Indians are very anglicised now, very westernized you see.

537
00:35:32,348 --> 00:35:35,154
So, they want to say, "We don't believe in all these fictions",

538
00:35:35,154 --> 00:35:38,205
so they're becoming English.

539
00:35:38,868 --> 00:35:43,868
For them, to become English is the last epitome, 
it's the last word.

540
00:35:43,868 --> 00:35:46,108
"So we don't believe in Rama, nothing, you see." All right,

541
00:35:46,308 --> 00:35:49,148
it's all our old style of thinking.

542
00:35:49,148 --> 00:35:51,868
But he exists and he's within us!

543
00:35:51,868 --> 00:35:55,508
It can be proved with your Kundalini awakening.

544
00:35:55,508 --> 00:36:00,772
The person who has got asthma, who suffers from asthma,

545
00:36:00,772 --> 00:36:03,693
catches on the right heart.

546
00:36:03,693 --> 00:36:07,908
You have to take the name of Rama to cure him.

547
00:36:07,908 --> 00:36:13,348
Nothing else can cure him. It's simple.

548
00:36:13,348 --> 00:36:16,068
The Kundalini stops here.

549
00:36:16,268 --> 00:36:18,908
Many people don't believe in Christ.

550
00:36:19,108 --> 00:36:24,631
"We don't believe in Christ". But you don't believe in Christ, but under what circumstaces?

551
00:36:24,631 --> 00:36:29,071
 Why, why don't you believe in Christ?

552
00:36:29,908 --> 00:36:33,472
"Because you see, we don't think he existed, how can it be possible?"

553
00:36:33,472 --> 00:36:37,933
"We don't believe in Moses, we don't believe in Christ, we don't believe in anybody". All right.

554
00:36:37,933 --> 00:36:41,195
Do you believe in yourself?

555
00:36:41,195 --> 00:36:44,002
Perhaps that is missing.

556
00:36:44,348 --> 00:36:47,953
Because the Self is not there.

557
00:36:47,953 --> 00:36:51,073
If you know your Self, you should believe in them.

558
00:36:51,073 --> 00:36:54,908
Because when Kundalini rises, at this point you'll be amazed,

559
00:36:55,148 --> 00:36:57,948
at this point, whether you believe in Christ or not,

560
00:36:58,148 --> 00:36:59,948
at this point,

561
00:37:00,148 --> 00:37:03,908
at the Agnya chakra, where you see the crossing of it,

562
00:37:03,908 --> 00:37:06,988
you have to say Lord's Prayer.

563
00:37:06,988 --> 00:37:10,148
You have to take the name of Christ. 
Otherwise, Kundalini doesn't rise.

564
00:37:10,148 --> 00:37:12,908
Now most of the people who are here, who are Realized, know this.

565
00:37:13,108 --> 00:37:15,655
It has been proved to them.

566
00:37:16,348 --> 00:37:20,988
In the Nabhi, in this Void, 
if it is hanging, you have to take the name of Moses.

567
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:24,671
Whether you are a Jew or not, or a hater of Jews 
or whatever you may be,

568
00:37:24,671 --> 00:37:30,324
you have to take the name of a Jew, of Moses.

569
00:37:31,348 --> 00:37:35,687
The whole movement of the Kundalini is to intergrate

570
00:37:35,687 --> 00:37:41,348
all the truths which are treated as miraculous,  
some people think it's falsehood,

571
00:37:41,348 --> 00:37:43,308
it's good for nothing, useless.

572
00:37:43,871 --> 00:37:49,052
All these things are proved by the movement of the Kundalini

573
00:37:49,052 --> 00:37:52,168
in your central path.

574
00:37:52,988 --> 00:37:58,535
And the greatest of greatest thing 
that is proved, is that God exists.

575
00:37:58,535 --> 00:38:02,348
Not only exists but he's active,

576
00:38:02,348 --> 00:38:06,188
that he does everything for us,

577
00:38:06,188 --> 00:38:10,296
that it is he who is the truth and it 's his power of Brahma,

578
00:38:10,296 --> 00:38:12,988
is the truth, the rest is all falsehood and nonsense.

579
00:38:13,908 --> 00:38:18,148
It works in all details too, in small details also.

580
00:38:19,348 --> 00:38:21,828
Now Sahaja Yogis have seen the miracle of Sahaja Yoga,

581
00:38:22,028 --> 00:38:23,828
they cannot explain it.

582
00:38:24,028 --> 00:38:26,148
You cannot explain also.

583
00:38:26,148 --> 00:38:28,108
When you become Realised, you are surprised

584
00:38:28,308 --> 00:38:30,613
how you are helped, how you meet people,

585
00:38:30,613 --> 00:38:33,195
how you get to things, how things work out,

586
00:38:33,195 --> 00:38:36,740
and how it works out so smoothly, you just can't imagine!

587
00:38:37,108 --> 00:38:43,348
Even to the smallest detail it can work out beautifully.

588
00:38:43,348 --> 00:38:47,108
But you have to establish yourself in the kingdom of God.

589
00:38:47,308 --> 00:38:49,960
Not with these fanatical ideas,

590
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:52,221
like you go to the Catholic church and they say,

591
00:38:52,221 --> 00:38:55,653
"Now you must confess".
I don't know from where did they get this idea!

592
00:38:55,653 --> 00:38:59,171
I don't think Christ would have ever said that, 
"You'd better go and confess to these priests",

593
00:38:59,171 --> 00:39:01,331
who are not even Realized souls.

594
00:39:02,188 --> 00:39:06,144
What are they going to do by confession?

595
00:39:07,268 --> 00:39:09,828
And then the answer came to me from a priest.

596
00:39:10,028 --> 00:39:12,148
I've asked him, he's a nice man, he's a Realized soul now,

597
00:39:12,348 --> 00:39:14,388
and he is working for Sahaja Yoga.

598
00:39:14,868 --> 00:39:17,968
But he told me, "The reason is in the Bible it's written,

599
00:39:17,988 --> 00:39:19,948
that, 'Whatever is corrected on this earth,

600
00:39:20,148 --> 00:39:22,048
will be corrected in the heaven'.

601
00:39:22,148 --> 00:39:24,148
That's why you'd better correct it by telling to the priest."

602
00:39:24,348 --> 00:39:27,008
Now, by any logical means do you think these priests

603
00:39:27,028 --> 00:39:31,148
can help you by telling them anything?

604
00:39:31,988 --> 00:39:37,268
Whatever is to be correced 
on this earth is your Kundalini and your chakras.

605
00:39:38,148 --> 00:39:41,588
If the language of the Bible has been,

606
00:39:41,828 --> 00:39:43,308
especially the Old Testament,

607
00:39:43,508 --> 00:39:48,868
has been extremely guarded, it was security measure.

608
00:39:48,868 --> 00:39:53,268
Like the Tree of Life 
is nothing but the Kundalini which is enlightened.

609
00:39:53,268 --> 00:39:57,068
Absolutely, it is that, it looks like that, like a tree.

610
00:39:57,268 --> 00:39:59,468
The other day, we were having program - I think today only,

611
00:39:59,908 --> 00:40:02,148
my children showed me, "Look, the Kundalini".

612
00:40:02,348 --> 00:40:05,868
I went and saw they were describing about Moses something,

613
00:40:05,868 --> 00:40:08,693
perhaps, and this was the Tree of Life, they said.

614
00:40:08,693 --> 00:40:12,741
And my children, grandchildren said, "See, the Kundalini".

615
00:40:14,108 --> 00:40:20,868
The language they used, may be for security measures made,

616
00:40:20,868 --> 00:40:24,908
but not the word,

617
00:40:24,908 --> 00:40:28,988
if it is now changed by human beings, it's false.

618
00:40:28,988 --> 00:40:31,988
Human beings can change words, that's a different point,

619
00:40:32,188 --> 00:40:35,348
but you can see, in Sahaja Yoga you can see what is changed,

620
00:40:35,828 --> 00:40:39,068
what is wrong, which is falsehood. You can see all these things.

621
00:40:39,268 --> 00:40:41,028
So, to disintegrate you,

622
00:40:41,228 --> 00:40:45,068
these things are again created in the name of religion, so-called.

623
00:40:46,014 --> 00:40:47,785
I mean these people are there for God

624
00:40:47,785 --> 00:40:50,874
or for making you feel guilty?

625
00:40:51,228 --> 00:40:56,948
Like, say Jews think that Christ was not a saviour.

626
00:40:56,948 --> 00:41:01,800
If they are still waiting for two hundred years. It's not true.

627
00:41:02,188 --> 00:41:05,268
He's the One, without Him you cannot raise the Kundalini.

628
00:41:05,468 --> 00:41:08,268
One should understand that he's the Mahavishnu described.

629
00:41:08,771 --> 00:41:10,451
But if I say something,

630
00:41:10,451 --> 00:41:12,948
that doesn't mean that you should believe Me. Not at all.

631
00:41:12,948 --> 00:41:16,108
But you should see for yourself because if you are interested,

632
00:41:16,308 --> 00:41:18,148
in the emancipation of the whole world,

633
00:41:18,348 --> 00:41:22,868
you should not get stuck on one,

634
00:41:22,868 --> 00:41:24,108
stuck on to one thing,

635
00:41:24,308 --> 00:41:26,868
and say, "This is the truth and this is the truth".

636
00:41:26,868 --> 00:41:28,468
No, seek for yourself what is the truth.

637
00:41:28,908 --> 00:41:30,908
And you'll be amazed that they are all one.

638
00:41:31,108 --> 00:41:33,028
Like Christ has said, "Those who are not against me

639
00:41:33,228 --> 00:41:36,259
are people who are with me".

640
00:41:37,348 --> 00:41:41,028
Moses and Christ are one, which can be proved.

641
00:41:42,348 --> 00:41:43,868
Same in other religions.

642
00:41:44,068 --> 00:41:46,068
So religion is another way to disintegrate you.

643
00:41:46,268 --> 00:41:50,772
You hate each other. Fundamentalists, fighting for what?

644
00:41:51,188 --> 00:41:53,028
Fundamental difference you know.

645
00:41:53,228 --> 00:41:54,600
Can you imagine?

646
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:58,068
What is the fundamental of these religions? It’s their Spirit, isn’t it?

647
00:41:58,268 --> 00:42:02,148
Is it a difference between the Spirit of one and another?

648
00:42:02,148 --> 00:42:07,879
Fundamentals are that God is one.  He's created us

649
00:42:07,879 --> 00:42:09,000
and what are you fighting about?

650
00:42:09,251 --> 00:42:10,811
Fundamental difference, you know? Fundamental difference,

651
00:42:10,988 --> 00:42:13,813
when there exists no difference at all.

652
00:42:14,188 --> 00:42:16,108
So we have psychologists,

653
00:42:16,308 --> 00:42:21,719
we have religious leaders, teaching us how to fight and hate God

654
00:42:21,719 --> 00:42:26,800
and your fellow being, in the name of God.

655
00:42:27,348 --> 00:42:30,348
This is another disintegration that sets into us.

656
00:42:30,828 --> 00:42:36,374
So, you people who are thinking, should understand

657
00:42:36,374 --> 00:42:38,828
that anything that creates such limitation within us

658
00:42:39,028 --> 00:42:40,948
any kind of fanaticism,

659
00:42:41,148 --> 00:42:44,308
is dangerous not only to you but to the whole society,

660
00:42:44,508 --> 00:42:46,148
and if you support it, even this much,

661
00:42:46,348 --> 00:42:48,794
you are supporting their destruction.

662
00:42:52,868 --> 00:42:54,908
With Sahaja Yoga we can establish,

663
00:42:54,908 --> 00:42:57,188
that anybody who is a fanatic,

664
00:42:57,388 --> 00:43:00,308
has problems and sufferes from many diseases

665
00:43:00,508 --> 00:43:02,148
which normal people don't.

666
00:43:04,348 --> 00:43:06,988
Then there are another type of people who

667
00:43:06,988 --> 00:43:10,228
say that, "All right, we don't believe in God.

668
00:43:10,228 --> 00:43:13,108
Because how can God create this fanaticism?"

669
00:43:13,348 --> 00:43:15,148
How can you blame God for fanaticism?

670
00:43:15,348 --> 00:43:17,228
I just can't understand. He never created it.

671
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:20,828
Actually, he never created any difference between you people,

672
00:43:20,828 --> 00:43:24,348
just a variety, just to make it beautiful, that's all.

673
00:43:24,348 --> 00:43:27,148
See, he didn't create England separately, this separately,

674
00:43:27,348 --> 00:43:30,868
to that extent the way you think. But he created them

675
00:43:30,868 --> 00:43:34,096
because they are different organs in the body of God.

676
00:43:35,188 --> 00:43:37,428
Do we take out an eye, and say "This is an eye

677
00:43:37,428 --> 00:43:41,558
so I do not have anything to do with it". Can we?

678
00:43:42,108 --> 00:43:43,868
It's like that!

679
00:43:44,068 --> 00:43:46,908
It's simple like that, it's so simple.

680
00:43:46,908 --> 00:43:50,988
The truth is so simple and so starkly lit before you:

681
00:43:50,988 --> 00:43:57,657
that we are doing all these things, fighting, quarelling,

682
00:43:57,657 --> 00:44:02,690
all the time within ourselves and without.

683
00:44:02,988 --> 00:44:06,028
Now, for that Self-realization,

684
00:44:06,228 --> 00:44:09,268
God has placed this wonderful thing, Kundalini within us,

685
00:44:09,468 --> 00:44:13,348
very beautifully, in the best possible position.

686
00:44:13,348 --> 00:44:16,348
It could not be better anywhere.

687
00:44:16,348 --> 00:44:19,188
To create this happening within us, in our awareness,

688
00:44:19,388 --> 00:44:23,108
the Kundalini has to rise and give us Realization.

689
00:44:23,108 --> 00:44:25,868
Now, people ask questions to God also, can be.

690
00:44:25,868 --> 00:44:30,408
They can say, "Why did he do it? 
Why didn't he make us wise, to begin with?"

691
00:44:30,408 --> 00:44:31,308
There are many like that.

692
00:44:31,308 --> 00:44:33,108
He should have just make us wise.

693
00:44:33,308 --> 00:44:37,401
Just from monkeys, dipped into some wisdom powder

694
00:44:37,401 --> 00:44:39,623
and pushed us out as wise people

695
00:44:39,623 --> 00:44:42,018
 living in the kingdom of God.

696
00:44:43,228 --> 00:44:48,828
"Why didn't he do it in our evolution, 
why did he make us so stupid?"

697
00:44:48,828 --> 00:44:52,348
One can say to God, you see, 
"Why did You create these problems?", talking to God.

698
00:44:52,348 --> 00:44:55,028
But who are we to ask Him questions? You see, he does what he likes.

699
00:44:55,228 --> 00:45:00,584
But, there's a reason.

700
00:45:00,584 --> 00:45:05,840
If you have to enter into that complete freedom, 
you must know how to be free.

701
00:45:06,188 --> 00:45:09,148
If you are just abandoned people, you have no sense of freedom,

702
00:45:09,348 --> 00:45:13,694
you don't know how to be choosy about the good and the bad,

703
00:45:13,694 --> 00:45:19,277
and you do not understand the value of your own wisdom.

704
00:45:19,868 --> 00:45:22,268
And if you are put in charge, imagine,

705
00:45:22,468 --> 00:45:25,988
some mad people put in charge in government, what will happen to you?

706
00:45:26,348 --> 00:45:30,000
So you have to grow up to that point to feel your freedom

707
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,746
 that in your freedom, you are righteous.

708
00:45:32,746 --> 00:45:36,939
 In that freedom, you are kind.

709
00:45:36,939 --> 00:45:45,308
In that freedom, you are absolutely balanced.

710
00:45:46,348 --> 00:45:50,148
And when that happens to you,

711
00:45:50,148 --> 00:45:52,908
then only the higher freedom is given to you.

712
00:45:53,108 --> 00:45:55,348
Because that's completely free.

713
00:45:55,348 --> 00:45:59,348
And once that high freedom comes into you,

714
00:45:59,348 --> 00:46:07,190
then you can feel the responsibility,

715
00:46:07,190 --> 00:46:16,078
 the responsibility to be responsible for your freedom.

716
00:46:16,948 --> 00:46:20,200
To put this beautiful responsability onto you

717
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,108
you have to know how to use your freedom.

718
00:46:22,308 --> 00:46:24,988
This is only transition which has led all of us,

719
00:46:25,188 --> 00:46:27,148
into this feeling 'guilty business',

720
00:46:27,348 --> 00:46:29,908
or this agression. Can you imagine?

721
00:46:30,108 --> 00:46:33,963
You could have waited for a while

722
00:46:33,963 --> 00:46:37,438
without feeling so sick.

723
00:46:37,828 --> 00:46:43,631
I mean, sometimes I feel the people are going for a funeral,

724
00:46:43,631 --> 00:46:46,868
the way they look miserable.

725
00:46:46,868 --> 00:46:51,228
The rest are busy creating such people.

726
00:46:51,228 --> 00:46:54,655
So there are only two types of people, if one sees:

727
00:46:54,655 --> 00:47:00,368
some who are being victims and another who are victimizing.

728
00:47:00,908 --> 00:47:04,828
So, to have the balance, in the center, to stand in the center,

729
00:47:05,348 --> 00:47:10,313
God has created this little tide

730
00:47:10,313 --> 00:47:13,021
 where you have to just learn how to weigh your freedom.

731
00:47:13,021 --> 00:47:15,000
 He gave you freedom to know,.

732
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,188
And this freedom is the only thing that has created,

733
00:47:17,388 --> 00:47:20,644
all the problems you face, not God.

734
00:47:20,644 --> 00:47:26,188
God hasn't created any problems for you. No. He wanted to make a very smooth ascent.

735
00:47:26,188 --> 00:47:29,268
He's made your machines so beautifully.

736
00:47:29,268 --> 00:47:33,553
Despite all this, you do get your Realization, no doubt.

737
00:47:33,553 --> 00:47:37,148
But because of habits, you may run down again to it;

738
00:47:37,148 --> 00:47:39,868
again you may have an ascent, again go down.

739
00:47:39,868 --> 00:47:41,988
It happens with some people, doesn't matter.

740
00:47:41,988 --> 00:47:46,228
But if you are steady, it is going to work out.

741
00:47:46,228 --> 00:47:48,996
It has to work out.

742
00:47:48,996 --> 00:47:53,318
If God has to save his creation, he has to do it.

743
00:47:53,318 --> 00:47:59,748
Only thing: how many are going to cooperate 
and take advantage of his compassion is to be seen.

744
00:47:59,748 --> 00:48:08,961
That is the most important thing, 
how many are going to be wise to see to their own advantage,

745
00:48:08,961 --> 00:48:12,068
to their own ascent.

746
00:48:12,068 --> 00:48:15,348
It's the only choice.

747
00:48:15,348 --> 00:48:19,519
May God bless you.

748
00:48:20,348 --> 00:48:23,028
If you have any questions you may ask me,

749
00:48:23,028 --> 00:48:27,897
and then I will do the Realization.

750
00:48:30,868 --> 00:48:34,228
Mother, how the negative force is created?

751
00:48:34,868 --> 00:48:35,948
What's it?

752
00:48:35,948 --> 00:48:38,508
How this negative force is created to begin within?

753
00:48:38,988 --> 00:48:40,988
What is he saying?

754
00:48:40,988 --> 00:48:44,753
How the negative force is created, to begin with?

755
00:48:45,661 --> 00:48:49,854
By the great human beings.

756
00:48:52,108 --> 00:48:57,228
Who has created atom bomb? Same type.

757
00:48:57,228 --> 00:49:01,348
From the very beginning, 
they started creating this negative force.

758
00:49:01,348 --> 00:49:04,442
All kinds.

759
00:49:05,188 --> 00:49:12,948
In seeking, as I told you, in seeking,
they set in this vicious circle

760
00:49:12,948 --> 00:49:16,948
which started creating. 
And the, you see, this mistake is small.

761
00:49:17,148 --> 00:49:22,708
What is the mistake in separating a hydrogen atom, isn't it?

762
00:49:22,708 --> 00:49:24,988
Just they did it, you see, for fun sake maybe.

763
00:49:24,988 --> 00:49:27,619
I don't know why they did it.

764
00:49:27,948 --> 00:49:31,228
But now, that will become like a devil
sitting on everybody's head, in everybody.

765
00:49:31,228 --> 00:49:35,348
Thank God only, whatever they create frightens them, thank God.

766
00:49:35,348 --> 00:49:37,948
So they are not going to use it, but

767
00:49:38,148 --> 00:49:42,412
who has created that? Human beings.

768
00:49:42,412 --> 00:49:44,410
In ignorance, they have done it.

769
00:49:44,410 --> 00:49:46,669
As a Mother, I have to say that.

770
00:49:46,669 --> 00:49:49,188
I cannot say that it was deliberated.

771
00:49:49,388 --> 00:49:53,448
It's a dangerous situation there.

772
00:49:57,868 --> 00:50:00,948
It's obvious, in your lifetime, people have created atom bombs.

773
00:50:01,148 --> 00:50:04,043
What was the need?

774
00:50:04,868 --> 00:50:06,502
I mean, for a stranger like me,

775
00:50:06,502 --> 00:50:09,001
I don't understand what is the need to create an atom bomb,

776
00:50:09,001 --> 00:50:11,829
 what is the need?

777
00:50:14,028 --> 00:50:16,763
Who are they to create this kind of a democracy

778
00:50:16,763 --> 00:50:19,973
and this kind of communism,

779
00:50:19,973 --> 00:50:23,148
and this kind of all nonsensical institutions,

780
00:50:23,348 --> 00:50:26,498
which just make the people fight?

781
00:50:34,308 --> 00:50:36,148
Any other questions please?

782
00:50:36,348 --> 00:50:38,388
And you can't blame God for that.

783
00:50:38,868 --> 00:50:42,861
At least, God didn't tell you to make atom bomb.

784
00:50:50,228 --> 00:50:52,148
Any other question please?

785
00:50:53,068 --> 00:50:54,068
I have got one.

786
00:50:54,268 --> 00:50:54,868
Yes.

787
00:50:55,068 --> 00:50:57,148
Why do you think, are people

788
00:50:57,348 --> 00:51:00,148
all the time so afraid of losing things,

789
00:51:00,348 --> 00:51:05,108
of losing their ego, of losing their relatives, or-

790
00:51:05,868 --> 00:51:09,043
but not losing but -

791
00:51:09,348 --> 00:51:12,348
losing their - what they have built up in themselves,

792
00:51:12,828 --> 00:51:14,948
their identity that they think they are.

793
00:51:15,148 --> 00:51:17,148
They are afraid of losing it.

794
00:51:17,868 --> 00:51:19,308
Why they are afraid?

795
00:51:19,508 --> 00:51:20,268
Yes.

796
00:51:20,468 --> 00:51:22,948
They have been cooked up like that, you know.

797
00:51:23,348 --> 00:51:25,868
They are told like that, they are conditioned like that.

798
00:51:26,148 --> 00:51:27,388
What can they do?

799
00:51:27,868 --> 00:51:29,948
You see, that all the time, if somebody tells you

800
00:51:30,148 --> 00:51:32,148
that you are going to lose, "It's very precious, very precious",

801
00:51:32,348 --> 00:51:34,348
you see, you'll hold on to it.

802
00:51:34,948 --> 00:51:37,948
But one must know in growth, in life,

803
00:51:37,948 --> 00:51:40,188
when a flower becomes a fruit,

804
00:51:40,388 --> 00:51:43,348
it looses flower for fruit to come,

805
00:51:43,348 --> 00:51:46,148
to grow into new.

806
00:51:46,148 --> 00:51:52,772
When an egg breaks,
its shell falls off and the bird comes out.

807
00:51:52,772 --> 00:51:57,128
It's not a loosing, it is growth.

808
00:51:58,028 --> 00:52:04,651
You have been frightened, what can you do? 
From the very beginning.

809
00:52:05,348 --> 00:52:09,174
What is there to lose 
if you are not holding on to anything?

810
00:52:10,228 --> 00:52:11,388
All right?

811
00:52:11,828 --> 00:52:14,028
What is there to lose, you just tell me?

812
00:52:14,268 --> 00:52:16,148
If you're not holding onto something,

813
00:52:16,348 --> 00:52:19,355
then, if there's no catch on anything,

814
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:23,115
what are you going to loose? You are just enjoing on giving.

815
00:52:25,988 --> 00:52:28,836
What do we take from here?

816
00:52:29,348 --> 00:52:31,828
When we go our hands are like this,

817
00:52:32,188 --> 00:52:34,754
when we come our hands are like this.

818
00:52:35,028 --> 00:52:37,593
Our hands are open, when we go.

819
00:52:37,593 --> 00:52:40,948
 We can't take anything, we confess it.

820
00:52:40,948 --> 00:52:46,237
Even ego we leave here. Everything we leave here.

821
00:52:48,388 --> 00:52:50,988
All myths, so many myths have been created,

822
00:52:51,188 --> 00:52:53,028
and man is living with the mythical ideas.

823
00:52:53,228 --> 00:52:56,068
I tell you he's living, he's compromizing with the myths.

824
00:52:56,268 --> 00:52:58,507
All the time, he doesn't accept a myth

825
00:52:58,507 --> 00:53:00,868
then they say, "He's not a sane person".

826
00:53:00,868 --> 00:53:03,188
All sorts of, and then many, many myths set in.

827
00:53:03,388 --> 00:53:07,028
People start copying others, you see, blindly.

828
00:53:07,308 --> 00:53:12,028
It's all, you see, to an ignorant person like me,

829
00:53:12,028 --> 00:53:17,576
it's something I just don't understand; what is the need?

830
00:53:20,068 --> 00:53:23,800
But I'm talking of the real world where you have to enter into,

831
00:53:23,988 --> 00:53:25,308
it is reality.

832
00:53:25,508 --> 00:53:30,800
And do you know? Reality is love.

833
00:53:30,988 --> 00:53:33,000
It's love.

834
00:53:33,348 --> 00:53:37,735
But not the way human beings understand love.

835
00:53:37,735 --> 00:53:41,228
But love which flows,

836
00:53:41,228 --> 00:53:45,000
which thinks, which cooperates,

837
00:53:45,028 --> 00:53:49,165
and generates the feeling of joy.

838
00:53:50,268 --> 00:53:53,468
It's a very different world that we have to enter into.

839
00:53:54,148 --> 00:53:59,108
But what will you lose? What have you got?

840
00:53:59,108 --> 00:54:02,740
What you have that is lost?

841
00:54:02,988 --> 00:54:04,108
That's your Spirit.

842
00:54:04,308 --> 00:54:08,285
And what you don't have, you are holding on to it.

843
00:54:09,068 --> 00:54:11,028
There's nothing to be lost, it's very true,

844
00:54:11,028 --> 00:54:14,712
they are so fightened, you don't know.

845
00:54:14,712 --> 00:54:18,793
Very frightened.

846
00:54:22,028 --> 00:54:27,603
They are made like that, what can you do?

847
00:54:27,948 --> 00:54:29,988
But they lose everything to a person

848
00:54:30,188 --> 00:54:33,348
who knows how to handle this condition in the real sense.

849
00:54:34,028 --> 00:54:37,296
You can just become like a cabage with some people.

850
00:54:37,296 --> 00:54:40,498
Really, they can make you a cabbage.

851
00:54:41,828 --> 00:54:45,000
In the name of God, in the name of enlightenement, they can.

852
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,727
Yes, they can harm you.

853
00:54:51,868 --> 00:54:53,553
Then they are not worried.

854
00:54:53,553 --> 00:54:56,108
I don't know how they get this confidence with that.

855
00:54:56,108 --> 00:54:59,108
Like the other day, 
we had somebody from 'Charismatic Movement'.

856
00:54:59,308 --> 00:55:01,348
You remember that? Norman.

857
00:55:01,348 --> 00:55:03,948
And I hope you have not taken any

858
00:55:04,148 --> 00:55:06,028
photographe of him, did you?

859
00:55:06,028 --> 00:55:08,028
We were also worried about him.

860
00:55:08,228 --> 00:55:12,068
And he went into such movements of the body,

861
00:55:12,068 --> 00:55:15,068
for at least half an hour

862
00:55:15,268 --> 00:55:18,348
he was so much in a very funny type of epilepsy, you see.

863
00:55:19,135 --> 00:55:23,492
All his body was moving and terrible he was crying, weeping

864
00:55:23,492 --> 00:55:26,237
he fell down on the ground, you can't imagine.

865
00:55:27,348 --> 00:55:30,108
And he said, "This I've been doing and so many are doing like this,

866
00:55:30,308 --> 00:55:32,068
and they think they are getting into Holy Ghost".

867
00:55:32,268 --> 00:55:34,108
I said, "Holy Ghost?

868
00:55:34,308 --> 00:55:37,148
What an unholy thing it is to be like that".

869
00:55:38,348 --> 00:55:42,439
Holy Ghost? Can you imagine?

870
00:55:50,348 --> 00:55:52,308
He wanted to get out of it. He could not.

871
00:55:52,508 --> 00:55:53,908
Now, he's all right, perfectly all right.

872
00:55:54,108 --> 00:55:56,108
He's like a small little child.

873
00:55:56,308 --> 00:56:00,000
I wish you could see that, John.

874
00:56:00,068 --> 00:56:04,348
You should have seen it, really.

875
00:56:04,348 --> 00:56:09,437
Shocking it was. Much worse than TM, I tell you, much worse.

876
00:56:10,028 --> 00:56:14,348
Because the movement was so fast,

877
00:56:14,590 --> 00:56:18,108
unrhythmic, big fast movements.

878
00:56:18,108 --> 00:56:22,599
The whole body was gesticulating and this was too much.

879
00:56:27,108 --> 00:56:30,501
But he got cured.

880
00:56:36,948 --> 00:56:41,313
Any other question?

881
00:56:46,508 --> 00:56:51,297
Ego is one problem, I must say, it's a very big problem.

882
00:56:52,108 --> 00:56:55,327
And for ego,

883
00:56:55,327 --> 00:56:59,348
 like some people say,  "Mother, why You should do it?"

884
00:56:59,348 --> 00:57:02,028
I said, "You better do it, it's very good idea.

885
00:57:02,228 --> 00:57:04,526
I would like to retire".

886
00:57:04,526 --> 00:57:07,451
But you can't do it, what to do? You see.

887
00:57:07,451 --> 00:57:10,853
All right, now you do so many things, I don´t feel bad.

888
00:57:10,853 --> 00:57:13,216
Why should you feel bad if I know something.

889
00:57:13,216 --> 00:57:16,256
You know one thing I know is to awaken, awakening of the Kundalini.

890
00:57:16,256 --> 00:57:18,679
Now, what can I do about it?

891
00:57:19,148 --> 00:57:21,852
Are you going to crucify me for that?

892
00:57:25,348 --> 00:57:29,198
I mean I don't get any - what you call -

893
00:57:29,198 --> 00:57:31,534
 title from your government for that,

894
00:57:31,534 --> 00:57:34,098
no payment, nothing.

895
00:57:36,908 --> 00:57:38,148
So why? Why to feel bad?

896
00:57:38,348 --> 00:57:40,028
I mean I will make you the same way.

897
00:57:40,228 --> 00:57:43,148
You will raise other's Kundalini also.

898
00:57:43,348 --> 00:57:45,148
So what's the harm?

899
00:57:45,348 --> 00:57:49,108
You will, of course, you are going to do it yourself.

900
00:57:49,108 --> 00:57:51,788
Supposing I have the keys with me: if I give you the keys

901
00:57:51,988 --> 00:57:54,108
will you feel your ego will be hurt or not?

902
00:57:54,348 --> 00:57:57,028
See, if I am a trustee, I have to give you isn't it?

903
00:57:57,988 --> 00:58:01,308
Do you feel your ego hurt, if I give you your keys?

904
00:58:01,308 --> 00:58:04,437
It's so simple as that.

905
00:58:08,348 --> 00:58:11,108
This is your own, this is your own property, I've got the keys,

906
00:58:11,308 --> 00:58:14,613
I'll give you because I have got them, now what to do?

907
00:58:14,908 --> 00:58:17,711
If you have them, it's very good,

908
00:58:17,711 --> 00:58:20,539
You never had, so I'm giving you.

909
00:58:22,348 --> 00:58:26,348
What is there to feel hurt about that part?

910
00:58:26,348 --> 00:58:28,068
Actually, I have to work very hard.

911
00:58:28,068 --> 00:58:29,920
You don't have to work hard at all.

912
00:58:29,988 --> 00:58:33,078
To begin with, then up to you.

913
00:58:40,908 --> 00:58:43,558
Any other question?

914
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:47,508
I would like Sahaja Yogis to ask me questions,

915
00:58:47,988 --> 00:58:51,028
for one reason, because when they are faced with life, and

916
00:58:51,228 --> 00:58:52,868
other people will ask them questions,

917
00:58:52,868 --> 00:58:55,976
so any questions which you have not been able to answer

918
00:58:55,976 --> 00:59:00,000
you can ask me and then we have our Realization.

919
00:59:03,068 --> 00:59:04,013
Mother?

920
00:59:04,013 --> 00:59:04,992
Yes?

921
00:59:04,992 --> 00:59:08,468
What is the approach towards the Christian Church?

922
00:59:08,468 --> 00:59:09,828
What is it?

923
00:59:10,028 --> 00:59:13,868
What it's our approach, the line, for the Christian Church?

924
00:59:13,868 --> 00:59:17,063
Have pity for them.

925
00:59:21,228 --> 00:59:25,679
You see, I took my birth in the Christian religion, in India,

926
00:59:26,348 --> 00:59:29,148
and first, the Hindus, you see, they were very upset

927
00:59:29,348 --> 00:59:33,992
that, "How could She take birth in a Christian religion?"

928
00:59:33,992 --> 00:59:37,103
I mean, so-called Christian religion.

929
00:59:37,348 --> 00:59:45,000
And I must tell you, I was baptized forcibly by a Lutheran Church.

930
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,823
All right?

931
00:59:49,068 --> 00:59:55,891
The simple answer is that Christians are the most fanatic people.

932
00:59:56,268 --> 01:00:00,000
And the Indian Christians are the worst

933
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,619
because they think Christ was born in England.

934
01:00:04,148 --> 01:00:06,948
Really they think so. You see, if you have an English name

935
01:00:07,148 --> 01:00:09,948
then you are a real Christian. Otherwise, you are not.

936
01:00:09,948 --> 01:00:13,348
You can't imagine how ignorant they are.

937
01:00:13,348 --> 01:00:17,348
And how the Christans are most fanatic. It looks funny but it is so.

938
01:00:18,188 --> 01:00:23,948
Because their fanatism is so beautifully managed.

939
01:00:23,948 --> 01:00:27,348
It is not like Khomeini is, which is stark open fanaticism.

940
01:00:28,148 --> 01:00:32,068
You know, Khomeini is that and he has to accept he is.

941
01:00:32,068 --> 01:00:36,988
But this way it is very well polished, you know, beautifully done.

942
01:00:36,988 --> 01:00:40,174
Others can be said they are stones

943
01:00:40,174 --> 01:00:42,988
but this is like a diamond artificially made.

944
01:00:43,348 --> 01:00:48,470
They do social work this Christian way.

945
01:00:48,470 --> 01:00:51,108
Now for example, if you ask somebody the way in England,

946
01:00:51,308 --> 01:00:53,760
it's a Christian way to tell the way, you see.

947
01:00:53,868 --> 01:00:57,268
What God has got to do with this?Just tell me.

948
01:00:57,268 --> 01:00:59,188
They have mixed up God with all these things,

949
01:00:59,388 --> 01:01:01,948
it's such a big mixture they have made,

950
01:01:01,948 --> 01:01:07,356
that the fanaticism of Christianity is very much in delusion.

951
01:01:09,268 --> 01:01:16,047
For them, begging in the name of God is also Christian.

952
01:01:16,988 --> 01:01:19,114
It's a very dangerous game,

953
01:01:19,114 --> 01:01:22,308
because they are the cleverest of all, they think.

954
01:01:22,308 --> 01:01:25,868
So, the way they have entangled themselves into,

955
01:01:26,348 --> 01:01:30,988
it's so much dogmatic and so beautifully philosophised.

956
01:01:31,348 --> 01:01:33,348
It's a philosophy.

957
01:01:33,348 --> 01:01:36,028
To know it, you have to get out of it.

958
01:01:36,028 --> 01:01:41,199
It is so beautiful, you can't imagine. It's so beautiful.

959
01:01:41,988 --> 01:01:47,346
And so appealing, they are the most kindest people,

960
01:01:47,346 --> 01:01:52,216
compassion personified, great people, Christians.

961
01:01:52,216 --> 01:01:56,091
And the Christains believe it. Christ never asked you to beg.

962
01:01:56,953 --> 01:02:00,148
He never asked you to collect money for the poor.

963
01:02:00,348 --> 01:02:04,634
Nothing of the kind. It was not his idea at all, you see.

964
01:02:04,988 --> 01:02:07,148
He wanted you to get your Realization.

965
01:02:07,348 --> 01:02:09,935
That's what he wanted.

966
01:02:10,268 --> 01:02:13,148
You have created the poor.

967
01:02:13,148 --> 01:02:17,108
And you'd better look after them. That's not God's job.

968
01:02:17,108 --> 01:02:19,988
Communists may be the greatest Christians, like that,

969
01:02:20,268 --> 01:02:22,988
the way they look after their poor.

970
01:02:23,348 --> 01:02:28,279
God's job is one: is to give you Realization. Not other one.

971
01:02:29,828 --> 01:02:35,986
To take you away from this ignorance and mire of life,

972
01:02:37,348 --> 01:02:41,398
into that beautiful, blissful, kingdom of God.

973
01:02:41,398 --> 01:02:45,000
 That is the work of God.

974
01:02:45,148 --> 01:02:47,868
And not these things which you describe back.

975
01:02:48,068 --> 01:02:53,021
But it looks so idealistic, you know, 
the whole thing is such an idealism.

976
01:02:53,828 --> 01:02:55,988
That's why it's very, very dangerous.

977
01:02:56,188 --> 01:03:00,000
And it's so well organized.

978
01:03:01,868 --> 01:03:06,108
So well organized, you know, so well organized.

979
01:03:06,108 --> 01:03:10,508
Even the hymn numbers, everything is done so well, 
every book done so well.

980
01:03:10,508 --> 01:03:15,000
Stand up to sing. Now you sit down. 
So regimented, beautifully.

981
01:03:15,148 --> 01:03:17,753
No one can realize even that this is,

982
01:03:17,753 --> 01:03:20,348
we are going all to madness, you see.

983
01:03:20,348 --> 01:03:23,348
It's a very wonderful thing.

984
01:03:24,028 --> 01:03:26,228
You are not supposed to look this side or that side.

985
01:03:26,428 --> 01:03:29,308
It's all right. In England, I have Christians,

986
01:03:29,308 --> 01:03:31,428
many have been Christians, you see.

987
01:03:31,868 --> 01:03:34,234
I have Christians, Jews, all kinds of disciples.

988
01:03:34,234 --> 01:03:38,468
Indian Christians, I don't have even one. Except for,  
of course, my family people are from there,

989
01:03:38,468 --> 01:03:40,428
but they've known my childhood, they know me.

990
01:03:40,868 --> 01:03:45,442
But the rest of them, for them I am a healer!

991
01:03:47,828 --> 01:03:51,829
I am, believe me!

992
01:03:54,148 --> 01:03:58,562
Hindus are my disciples, then Muslims are. But not Christians.

993
01:03:58,988 --> 01:04:03,724
Not one, I knew this.

994
01:04:05,348 --> 01:04:13,279
And when I went to America,
they pronounced, "A Christian mystic has come".

995
01:04:13,279 --> 01:04:17,469
That gave me good marks, you know.

996
01:04:18,868 --> 01:04:22,893
People came to see me because I was a Christian mystic,

997
01:04:22,893 --> 01:04:29,403
properly baptized. I must get my certificate also.

998
01:04:32,348 --> 01:04:37,148
So our attitude should be of simply pity towards them.

999
01:04:37,148 --> 01:04:40,028
Like Blake has said, "The priest cursed,

1000
01:04:40,948 --> 01:04:43,788
cursed my head when he baptized me."

1001
01:04:43,988 --> 01:04:45,913
It's something like that, it is really.

1002
01:04:45,913 --> 01:04:48,148
We should have really simple pity for all the people,

1003
01:04:48,348 --> 01:04:52,148
who go to churches where there are all the graves.

1004
01:04:52,348 --> 01:04:56,148
They sit on the graves, take all the spirits into themselves.

1005
01:04:56,348 --> 01:04:58,994
God save them.

1006
01:05:02,348 --> 01:05:09,818
I don't know why Christians, everyone is just like that.

1007
01:05:12,508 --> 01:05:15,988
But, among the Christians only, I am sure,

1008
01:05:16,228 --> 01:05:20,995
one day Sahaja Yoga will come up very well.

1009
01:05:22,028 --> 01:05:31,006
That's the power of Christ. I hope so. 
I hope so.

1010
01:05:33,988 --> 01:05:38,928
Mislaid, and misled people also,

1011
01:05:39,188 --> 01:05:41,868
who are enjoying that misleading

1012
01:05:41,868 --> 01:05:44,988
are most difficult, aren't they?
Don't you think so?

1013
01:05:45,028 --> 01:05:48,108
How can you talk to them?

1014
01:05:48,108 --> 01:05:51,348
Who can break it?

1015
01:05:56,988 --> 01:05:59,948
When I go to India, I can speak,

1016
01:06:00,268 --> 01:06:05,988
in a 'sanathana', means Catholic,
'sankar sanathana' means Catholic temple,

1017
01:06:06,188 --> 01:06:09,148
where thousands of people came to attend my lecture 

1018
01:06:09,348 --> 01:06:12,148
and they respect me as a saint.

1019
01:06:12,148 --> 01:06:15,428
Do you think in any church whatsoever,

1020
01:06:15,988 --> 01:06:17,908
I would be respected like that,

1021
01:06:17,908 --> 01:06:21,148
except for one "Unity Church" we had,

1022
01:06:21,148 --> 01:06:23,268
where all kinds of bhoots are respected.

1023
01:06:23,268 --> 01:06:26,828
So, I was also called to give a lecture.

1024
01:06:27,348 --> 01:06:33,228
It was I think more of a - I don't know, 
money-making proposition whatever it was.

1025
01:06:33,228 --> 01:06:35,955
Whatever it was.

1026
01:06:37,108 --> 01:06:41,028
But in India, that's the blessing

1027
01:06:41,268 --> 01:06:43,308
of the Hindus that they are not organized.

1028
01:06:43,508 --> 01:06:46,868
For them, a saint is a saint.

1029
01:06:47,868 --> 01:06:56,178
Even the Prime minister, even, I would say, the president  

1030
01:06:56,178 --> 01:07:01,323
  of India would stand for a saint. They wouldn't sit.

1031
01:07:03,148 --> 01:07:05,894
These ideas are not here.

1032
01:07:06,148 --> 01:07:11,448
We're too organized to get out of this organized way,

1033
01:07:11,448 --> 01:07:15,520
 to find out what is beyond. You see, we just - 

1034
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:19,107
all our spirituality is satisfied by going to Sunday church, 

1035
01:07:19,107 --> 01:07:22,397
finished! Or to give some money for the feat. That's all. 

1036
01:07:22,397 --> 01:07:23,948
That's not the way it is.

1037
01:07:24,148 --> 01:07:26,228
It's much, much, much more.

1038
01:07:27,348 --> 01:07:30,188
But be kind to them.

1039
01:07:30,948 --> 01:07:35,348
Christ has said, "You'll be calling me, 'Christ, Christ'.
I won't recognize you"

1040
01:07:35,348 --> 01:07:42,346
That's what they are. I'm sorry for them, really sorry.

1041
01:07:46,348 --> 01:07:48,472
Any other question?

1042
01:07:49,988 --> 01:07:52,988
Mother, can everybody become aware at the most

1043
01:07:52,988 --> 01:07:54,988
how do you recognize them up?

1044
01:07:55,188 --> 01:07:58,028
Yes, everybody can.

1045
01:07:58,268 --> 01:08:01,108
But everybody doesn't mind, want it.

1046
01:08:01,348 --> 01:08:05,953
You see, they don't want it. See how many people are here.

1047
01:08:07,228 --> 01:08:09,948
But if it was some sort of a falsehood,

1048
01:08:09,948 --> 01:08:12,148
if I'd come with two horns,

1049
01:08:12,148 --> 01:08:15,800
there could have been three halls big like this.

1050
01:08:16,868 --> 01:08:20,068
People don't want reality, my child, they don't want it.

1051
01:08:20,348 --> 01:08:22,348
They never wanted it.

1052
01:08:22,988 --> 01:08:24,988
They always crucified it.

1053
01:08:26,348 --> 01:08:29,148
But now, at least, there are some who really want it.

1054
01:08:29,348 --> 01:08:32,108
And I am happy you think of others also,

1055
01:08:32,108 --> 01:08:34,498
very happy to know that.

1056
01:08:35,772 --> 01:08:39,652
But it’s a difficult task. 

1057
01:08:40,308 --> 01:08:43,740
I have to work very hard.

1058
01:08:44,988 --> 01:08:47,948
They don't want reality 
because in Sahaja Yoga it is a becoming,

1059
01:08:48,148 --> 01:08:50,228
It is not just to come and fill in a form,

1060
01:08:50,428 --> 01:08:55,038
"All right, you are the member", or you pay supposing a one-pound, a membership fees.

1061
01:08:55,038 --> 01:08:58,908
It's not that! It's your becoming, what you become!

1062
01:08:58,908 --> 01:09:03,268
It's your thing, that must happen. You must get your properties.

1063
01:09:03,268 --> 01:09:06,562
This is the problem.

1064
01:09:09,868 --> 01:09:12,936
You have to give up a little bit.

1065
01:09:12,936 --> 01:09:16,043
It's easy to give up.

1066
01:09:17,228 --> 01:09:19,988
It's very easy but I never talk about it before Realization,

1067
01:09:20,188 --> 01:09:22,148
because after Realization, you just give up.

1068
01:09:22,348 --> 01:09:23,908
If I tell you, half of you might go away,

1069
01:09:23,908 --> 01:09:26,218
so I'm not going to tell you.

1070
01:09:26,218 --> 01:09:29,095
You'd better get your Realization. It will work it out.

1071
01:09:29,095 --> 01:09:32,348
It will establish a new priority within yourself, naturally.

1072
01:09:32,348 --> 01:09:35,357
Because if you have light you see.

1073
01:09:35,988 --> 01:09:38,348
You see snake as snake and rope as rope.

1074
01:09:39,148 --> 01:09:43,449
So, I don't have to tell you, 
you just see it, you just feel it, it happens to you.

1075
01:09:44,108 --> 01:09:46,148
Yes, I know, I know. I wish I could.

1076
01:09:46,348 --> 01:09:49,783
It can be done to all the new people,

1077
01:09:49,783 --> 01:09:52,338
 whatever race you may belong; it can.

1078
01:09:52,338 --> 01:09:55,164
But how many are there?

1079
01:09:56,348 --> 01:09:58,148
It's a very slow movement.

1080
01:09:58,348 --> 01:10:02,498
For four years, I had only seven Britons with me.

1081
01:10:02,498 --> 01:10:08,309
I was struggling with them. Four years, can you imagine? In England.

1082
01:10:12,148 --> 01:10:14,251
It's tremendous task.

1083
01:10:15,348 --> 01:10:17,948
All right. So, you get your Realization now.

1084
01:10:17,948 --> 01:10:20,357
Let's see how many you bring in.

1085
01:10:22,188 --> 01:10:23,268
Yes?

1086
01:10:24,268 --> 01:10:29,396
Divine Holy Mother, after Self-realization,

1087
01:10:29,396 --> 01:10:32,794
 how long it takes for a new [unclear]

1088
01:10:32,794 --> 01:10:36,426
is it possible to stop reincarnating and seek perfection?

1089
01:10:36,948 --> 01:10:41,108
Is it easy? Last, what did he say? What d'you say?

1090
01:10:44,348 --> 01:10:47,388
Is it easy to? Last sentence, what do you say?

1091
01:10:47,868 --> 01:10:51,148
I was saying after Realization, is it possible

1092
01:10:51,348 --> 01:10:54,148
to stop reincarnating

1093
01:10:54,348 --> 01:10:59,148
and to be perfect in these troubled times?

1094
01:10:59,348 --> 01:11:03,753
You are reincarnated by Self-realization itself.

1095
01:11:05,348 --> 01:11:07,868
And to stop having rebirth and birth?

1096
01:11:08,068 --> 01:11:11,028
You don't think of these things afterwards.

1097
01:11:11,028 --> 01:11:16,563
Because you are not futuristic anymore. You live in the present.

1098
01:11:18,068 --> 01:11:20,108
You see these ideas of rebirth and

1099
01:11:20,308 --> 01:11:22,948
this frightening stuff: you should not have rebirth.

1100
01:11:23,188 --> 01:11:24,409
Why not?

1101
01:11:25,988 --> 01:11:30,508
I mean, you create a beautiful house, everything,

1102
01:11:30,988 --> 01:11:34,902
and then you say that you don't live in it?

1103
01:11:35,348 --> 01:11:40,268
When you become a rich man, you want to enjoy your wealth isn't it?

1104
01:11:40,268 --> 01:11:43,148
But they're not Buddha's saying:

1105
01:11:43,348 --> 01:11:46,148
birth is suffering, death is suffering.

1106
01:11:46,348 --> 01:11:49,868
Yes, that's true, but not Realization.

1107
01:11:56,228 --> 01:11:58,428
You see, what he has said is:

1108
01:11:58,988 --> 01:12:00,988
Buddha never asked you to

1109
01:12:00,988 --> 01:12:05,425
to limit your desire of ascent.

1110
01:12:05,425 --> 01:12:07,108
 Because people talk of God, once

1111
01:12:07,308 --> 01:12:10,468
they talked of it in India but nobody talked of the deities.

1112
01:12:10,468 --> 01:12:13,988
That was a problem, because it became a talk again.

1113
01:12:13,988 --> 01:12:18,908
Then they talked of a God which was abstract,

1114
01:12:18,908 --> 01:12:22,545
like you can say, Jehova and other things,

1115
01:12:22,874 --> 01:12:27,348
because they wanted people to get over their

1116
01:12:27,348 --> 01:12:31,988
stuck-up points you see. Nothing worked you see.

1117
01:12:31,988 --> 01:12:36,520
So Buddha said, "All right, let's talk only about
the Self-realization, nothing else. Not even of God.

1118
01:12:36,572 --> 01:12:41,863
Let's talk of that.
Let people get to Self-realization, then we'll talk about God.

1119
01:12:42,948 --> 01:12:47,055
So, he said, "All right. Only Self-realization. No God, nothing."

1120
01:12:47,388 --> 01:12:51,654
That was his job. Fix you up with the idea of Self-realization.

1121
01:12:51,988 --> 01:12:56,028
He said, "Dont' worship anything, don't worship, get your Self-realization.

1122
01:12:56,028 --> 01:13:01,707
They are worshipping everything under the sun, these Buddists!

1123
01:13:02,348 --> 01:13:05,191
What am I to do?

1124
01:13:07,531 --> 01:13:13,615
So whatever Buddha has said, 
everything is re-said in Sahaja Yoga.

1125
01:13:16,268 --> 01:13:18,268
“Buddham sharanam gachami.” 

1126
01:13:19,308 --> 01:13:23,062
I surrender myself to the enlightened One.

1127
01:13:23,348 --> 01:13:27,955
The One which is enlightened is your Spirit.

1128
01:13:29,188 --> 01:13:31,308
“Sangham sharanam gachami,” 

1129
01:13:31,508 --> 01:13:34,392
I surrender myself to the collectivity.

1130
01:13:34,392 --> 01:13:37,175
Unless and until you are a collectively conscious person,

1131
01:13:37,175 --> 01:13:39,464
how can you surrender?

1132
01:13:40,988 --> 01:13:45,000
Buddha also, whatever he said, 
is not understood before Realization. You cannot.

1133
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,493
“Dharmam sharanam gachami,” 

1134
01:13:47,493 --> 01:13:49,517
is the sustanance within us.

1135
01:13:49,517 --> 01:13:52,068
'Sharanam' means you become that.

1136
01:13:52,068 --> 01:13:54,828
It's not a mental thing, "Oh, I surrender myself".

1137
01:13:55,028 --> 01:13:57,836
But you just become.

1138
01:14:00,068 --> 01:14:02,148
You become the enlightened one.

1139
01:14:02,348 --> 01:14:05,038
You become the collectively conscious. 

1140
01:14:05,038 --> 01:14:09,087
You become the dharma, the sustenance, the religion within us.

1141
01:14:09,087 --> 01:14:11,087
You become!

1142
01:14:11,348 --> 01:14:13,148
That's what he meant.

1143
01:14:13,348 --> 01:14:17,557
But for them, 'Sharanam gachami' means take a wheel in the hand, go on 

1144
01:14:17,557 --> 01:14:20,228
"Buddham sharanam gachami".

1145
01:14:20,228 --> 01:14:24,658
Now. What this wheel is going to do, I just don't understand, you know.

1146
01:14:25,308 --> 01:14:27,828
They'll go on hours together, they'll go mad.

1147
01:14:28,028 --> 01:14:31,188
They will end up into lunatic asylum, beieve me.

1148
01:14:32,348 --> 01:14:35,868
Or like mad you have to say something, all the time praying.

1149
01:14:35,868 --> 01:14:38,908
Is that the way you are becoming?

1150
01:14:39,348 --> 01:14:43,498
They don't even know where is Buddha placed into yourself.

1151
01:14:48,348 --> 01:14:51,749
But Sahaja Yogis know where he is placed

1152
01:14:51,749 --> 01:14:53,619
and how to please him.

1153
01:14:54,028 --> 01:15:00,872
Whatever he said is nothing but Sahaja Yoga, absolutely 100%

1154
01:15:04,308 --> 01:15:09,863
Actually, Buddha was nobody else but an Incarnation,

1155
01:15:09,863 --> 01:15:13,087
 who reincarnated himself as Adi Shankaracharya. 

1156
01:15:13,087 --> 01:15:15,000
You can see it clearly in your being,

1157
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:16,828
it can be proved on Kundalini again!

1158
01:15:16,828 --> 01:15:19,801
You see, how can I prove it?

1159
01:15:23,348 --> 01:15:26,148
To understand them, first you get your Realization.

1160
01:15:26,348 --> 01:15:30,594
Again, I am talking like Buddha only.

1161
01:15:32,828 --> 01:15:37,617
He tried something 
by which he thought people will take to Realization.

1162
01:15:38,348 --> 01:15:40,813
But human beings as they are...

1163
01:15:41,908 --> 01:15:44,108
He thought they are very much involved in materialism,

1164
01:15:44,308 --> 01:15:47,348
take them out, try this, try that. Nothing works out.

1165
01:15:47,908 --> 01:15:50,028
Nothing.

1166
01:15:50,028 --> 01:15:55,106
Only thing that works out: the real happening, nothing else.

1167
01:16:00,268 --> 01:16:03,003
Mother, you are [inaudible]?

1168
01:16:03,348 --> 01:16:04,868
What's it?

1169
01:16:06,348 --> 01:16:09,218
Say it loudly.

1170
01:16:14,148 --> 01:16:17,103
All right?

1171
01:16:19,348 --> 01:16:23,228
Is there somebody else saying something which I didn't hear?

1172
01:16:23,428 --> 01:16:27,268
Today, the vibrations are so much that really, to be very franck,

1173
01:16:28,308 --> 01:16:29,788
you can't imagine!

1174
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,160
I don't know how I'm listening to you, what you are talking.

1175
01:16:32,348 --> 01:16:34,948
It's really too much flowing out.

1176
01:16:35,148 --> 01:16:37,228
I can't believe it. Why?

1177
01:16:37,428 --> 01:16:40,692
There must be some great seekers 
who must have come today.
