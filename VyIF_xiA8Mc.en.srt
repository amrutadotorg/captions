1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,720
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

2
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:22,560
At the very outset you have to know that truth is what it is.

3
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,560
We cannot change it.

4
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,840
We cannot transform it

5
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:33,240
and we cannot conceptualize it.

6
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:39,720
Also unfortunately at this human awareness

7
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:45,520
we cannot feel the truth,

8
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:55,160
so something has to be done,

9
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:01,440
something has to work out in our human awareness

10
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,600
in the evolutionary process.

11
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:11,160
We have become human beings from amoeba.

12
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:17,040
How did we become?

13
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,600
And if we are human beings

14
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:25,920
have we reached the Absolute State? We have not.

15
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:30,120
If we had reached the absolute state

16
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,800
then there would have been no problems

17
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,040
because everybody would have seen the same thing,

18
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,120
would have understood the same thing

19
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,840
and felt the same thing

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,760
but because we are living in a relative world

21
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,480
we have all these problems.

22
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,960
As it is, most of the problems are created

23
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,840
by human beings.

24
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:00,320
If you see ecological problems,

25
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:05,120
if you see economic problems, political problems,

26
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,040
physical problems,

27
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,720
mental problems, family problems,

28
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:17,360
all of them are related to human beings.

29
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:24,440
So we have gone wrong somewhere,

30
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,800
there's something that's a missing point

31
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,680
which we have not realized.

32
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:36,360
The advancements we have made in our civilization,

33
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,280
say in science,

34
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:43,960
has reached such a stage that we had to create atom bomb,

35
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,040
hydrogen bomb.

36
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:51,680
So all these mental efforts we have put in also boomerang on us

37
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,560
and create our destruction.

38
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,440
In every way we get frustrated,

39
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,160
and we start seeking what's the matter?

40
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,320
Then we turn to religion

41
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,720
and we find in religion also

42
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:13,680
it just works worse and worse.

43
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,520
Whatever is written in the Bible,

44
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,320
same about written in Koran if you read it, or Dhammapada

45
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,640
or Gita everywhere is about just the same,

46
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,800
there's not much of a change.

47
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,440
But still we may follow any religion,

48
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,640
so-called following I would say.

49
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:40,960
Still a human being belonging to any religion can commit any sin,

50
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,840
any sin.

51
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,920
There's no binding force on him of that religion.

52
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:51,160
Why is it all these great religions,

53
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:54,720
which were created by great incarnations

54
00:03:54,880 --> 00:04:00,160
and great prophets

55
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:05,240
have taken such a deviated path,

56
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,800
and why we have not been able to achieve

57
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:12,560
whatever they have promised to us?

58
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:18,360
What is the reason why we could not achieve that?

59
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:21,840
What has gone wrong?

60
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,560
If you read Koran you will be amazed,

61
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,200
the description of what was the vision of Mohammad Sahib

62
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,520
is far away from the Muslims as they are.

63
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,080
Same about Christians you can say.

64
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:45,520
When Christ has said "Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes."

65
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,840
Difficult to find Christians who don't have.

66
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,880
In this way we have to realize on one side

67
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:02,320
whatever mental efforts we are putting,

68
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:06,560
or on the other side whatever

69
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,840
physical or emotional efforts we are putting,

70
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,960
have come back to us,

71
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,960
destroying us.

72
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:24,360
We can see the result very clearly

73
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:27,880
why all these problems are there.

74
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:33,440
Still we adhere to something which is not reality.

75
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,800
We go on clinging to it

76
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,800
because perhaps we are born like that.

77
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,160
Perhaps we think that that's we have done now all our lives

78
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,920
so why give up.

79
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,960
And the forefathers have done the same,

80
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,920
you are doing the same.

81
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:52,560
But now a new category of very honest people are there

82
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,040
in this world who are seeking beyond.

83
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,960
William Blake has called them men of God,

84
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,160
those who will seek the truth

85
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:10,080
and they will make other people also godly.

86
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,920
That's the time has come, this resurrection time has come we should say

87
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,520
or this is the Last Judgment.

88
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:20,640
This Last Judgment is going to be done

89
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,000
by this Kundalini, the power within you.

90
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:26,440
This is your own power

91
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
which has to be awakened

92
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:33,520
and once it is awakened it passes through these centers as told to you

93
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,240
and lets you know that these are your problems.

94
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,280
These are the problems of your chakras.

95
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,960
They may be physical, may be emotional,

96
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:49,040
they may be, could be also spiritual.

97
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,920
And once you know these problems

98
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:54,200
and if you know how to solve these problems

99
00:06:54,360 --> 00:07:01,960
you can be a very normal, sensible, balanced personality.

100
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,440
That's not the only thing that happens

101
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:08,000
when you get your self realization.

102
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,880
Firstly what happens to you is that

103
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:16,440
when the Kundalini passes through your Agyna chakra

104
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:20,800
then you become thoughtlessly aware.

105
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:27,640
If you see all the sciences they have created about religion,

106
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:32,560
talks and the whole thing, it's just mental.

107
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:39,440
It's not inside, it's not innate, built within.

108
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,480
So one thought rises, another thought falls.

109
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,640
Another thought rises and falls down,

110
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,520
some come from the future, some come from the past,

111
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,280
and we are jumping on the cusp of these thoughts.

112
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:58,200
But if you say now, this is the present,

113
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:01,320
stop your mind at the stop point

114
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,120
which is the present, you can't,

115
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,240
you just can't do it.

116
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,440
Between these thoughts there is a gap.

117
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:15,000
This gap is the present, but it's so small, it's so small

118
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,600
that you cannot find it.

119
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:22,160
But when the Kundalini passes through,

120
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:26,400
then this center, then these two institutions as you see them,

121
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,360
the conditioning and the ego are just sucked in.

122
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:34,200
As a result you become thoughtlessly aware.

123
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,040
Means there is no thought.

124
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,160
But you are absolutely aware, very much more aware.

125
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,520
For example if you look at this beautiful hall

126
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:47,440
with the thoughtless awareness,

127
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,000
then the whole picture becomes clear

128
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:54,640
like a photo in your mind,

129
00:08:54,800 --> 00:09:01,520
whole thing is stored up into every detail so clearly

130
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,040
because present is the truth,

131
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,720
past is finished and future doesn't exist.

132
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:11,000
So to come to the present you have to have

133
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:15,280
this new awareness called as thoughtless awareness.

134
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,920
But when She crosses over

135
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,880
and pierces through your fontanel bone area

136
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:26,520
which is the actualization of your baptism.

137
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:30,440
Just people talk of baptism, "Come along I'll baptize you".

138
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,040
It's not possible that way.

139
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,560
It's just an artificial ritual.

140
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,560
Try to understand, this is not going to render

141
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,120
that actual happening within you

142
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:44,120
which is going to make you grow spiritually.

143
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,800
So the actualization of baptism takes place

144
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:50,600
and you can feel also from your fontanel bone area

145
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:56,000
a kind of a cool breeze of the Holy Ghost coming in.

146
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,680
You feel extremely relaxed.

147
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:05,040
Secondly that you jump into another higher awareness

148
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,960
which we call, as collective consciousness.

149
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,920
This means that

150
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:14,680
not only that you can you feel your own centers on your fingertips,

151
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:20,760
because these cool vibrations you can call

152
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,320
them start flowing through your own hands,

153
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,680
you can feel them.

154
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:29,720
But also you get information about others

155
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:33,840
as well as about yourself on these fingertips.

156
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:41,400
Automatically you become like a person who is a computer.

157
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:44,280
It starts working in such a wonderful manner

158
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,680
that you can find out about any disease,

159
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:52,200
any trouble without going through all the diagnosis or anything,

160
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:56,120
and if you know how to cure these troubles, physically, mentally,

161
00:10:56,280 --> 00:11:00,160
you can definitely cure yourself and also others

162
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,000
if you have reached that state

163
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,880
and have permanently achieved it.

164
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,720
This is what has to happen to us.

165
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:15,160
All of us have to achieve that state

166
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:18,600
which is your right to achieve it.

167
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:22,360
Sahaja means with you is born.

168
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,640
This yoga means the union.

169
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:30,880
The union with this All Pervading Power of God's love.

170
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:36,840
It exists or not, we have never bothered to find out.

171
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,760
We see these beautiful flowers,

172
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,800
very beautiful flowers and everything around.

173
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,320
When I came from Sydney I saw the beauty,

174
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,960
the nature had just spread for the pleasure of human beings,

175
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:53,440
we never even think how it has happened,

176
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,040
what has worked it out, all these living things.

177
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,360
We don't even think how this eye of ours

178
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:04,560
is such a beautiful camera, how it has been made,

179
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,560
how is it this brain which is such a great computer,

180
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:13,320
how is it made. Who has made it?

181
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:16,840
They may say it is autonomous but who is this auto?

182
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,520
We have never tried to find out.

183
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,960
That there is this All Pervading Power of God's love

184
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,320
which has done all this living work

185
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,480
and now for us it is to feel that,

186
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:31,320
that is the yoga is, the union with that Divine.

187
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:34,000
It's not physical, it's not mental,

188
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,280
but it is spiritual where

189
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:40,760
you start first time feeling this All Pervading Power.

190
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,800
Then only you have to know how to use this power

191
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,680
which flows through you.

192
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,400
But it moves very slowly and people,

193
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,760
you see this is not a plastic work

194
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,680
that you can go on producing many

195
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:59,120
and we don't have any organization as such,

196
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,160
we do not organize people

197
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:04,840
and we do not take any money at all, you cannot.

198
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
How much can you pay for this Divine Work?

199
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,200
How much do we pay to Mother Earth for what she gives us

200
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,280
all these beautiful flowers?

201
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,760
She doesn't understand money, so you cannot pay for it.

202
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,920
But there are many, many organizations afloat,

203
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:23,560
which are taking money, which are giving you mental heat

204
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,200
and people run after them,

205
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,760
they like to go on working out that yarn

206
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:32,560
that they have spun for you.

207
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:38,480
One has to go beyond this mind to feel the spirituality.

208
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:42,240
With this mind, that is human mind, you cannot understand it,

209
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,440
you have to have Divine mind.

210
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,560
But once you get your realization

211
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,160
your mind also gets enlightened,

212
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:53,640
and when your mind is enlightened, you can perceive,

213
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:57,440
penetrate into every situation

214
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:03,920
in such a deeper manner and the way you can improve it.

215
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:07,280
I can tell you a simple analogy to understand.

216
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:15,240
Supposing you are standing in the sea and the sea is rough,

217
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,520
you are afraid of the waves, very much afraid.

218
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:22,160
But supposing somebody puts you on the boat,

219
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,280
and then you can see those waves and enjoy them.

220
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,760
But supposing you learn how to swim

221
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,560
then you can jump in and save them.

222
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,840
It is not any brainwashing

223
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,320
or any sort of a bombardment of words,

224
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,240
but it is something that happens to you.

225
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:44,840
You become something as you have become human beings,

226
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,120
you become realized souls

227
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:53,120
as a result of this last breakthrough of your evolution.

228
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:56,040
This is happening everywhere no doubt

229
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,920
and it's working out very well in,

230
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:02,320
I think they told me, 62 countries

231
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,760
but at least I know of definitely of 52 countries

232
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,360
where there We have got very strong centers

233
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:11,240
where it is working out.

234
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,400
Now whatever we are telling you here

235
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,880
you need not accept blindfolded.

236
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,880
Blind faith is of no use.

237
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:22,160
First of all you must experience.

238
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,880
Just like a hypothesis I am putting this before you,

239
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:29,160
but you should have an open mind of a scientist.

240
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:32,880
Just open your mind and see for yourself it works.

241
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,760
If it works then you have to accept.

242
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,960
If you are honest you have to accept.

243
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,720
If it doesn't work. If it works with many,

244
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,240
why not try and work it out.

245
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,560
Most of the people do get their realization. I have seen it.

246
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,520
It's a wonderful thing that is happening

247
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:51,680
that masses of people can get realization.

248
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:55,960
Depends on also certain places like Russia I was amazed.

249
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,840
Where they have not heard the name of God

250
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,400
they have never heard the name of Christ.

251
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:02,440
They were not allowed to read Bible or any book,

252
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,280
they had no religion at all.

253
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,160
They believed in no religion.

254
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,800
Where thousands and thousands come to My program

255
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,680
and they all get their realization.

256
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,320
In a small place called Togliati

257
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:21,120
there are 22 thousand Sahaja Yogis practicing Sahaja Yoga.

258
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:24,040
Can you imagine it? I was so amazed.

259
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:29,480
Same about Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Poland.

260
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:32,800
I was amazed how these people, Czechoslovakia,

261
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,640
how they have taken to Sahaja Yoga so fast,

262
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:39,160
just like fish to water,

263
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,880
how they realized it, and nobody else,

264
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,800
all these false people, could not go there,

265
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,640
nothing could work out.

266
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,080
Only thing that has really worked out there

267
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:53,680
is something that is genuine. That is Sahaja Yoga.

268
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:58,840
One has to realize that as we are not in the Absolute State,

269
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,560
we have to reach to the Absolute State.

270
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,920
That desire should be there.

271
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,320
If that desire is there it works out

272
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,320
without any difficulty.

273
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,800
It is your own power which manifests

274
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,880
and gradually you can manifest them in such a way

275
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:19,960
that you can do so many things like giving realization to others,

276
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:26,680
curing others and also enjoying it,

277
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:32,800
because when the attention is filled with the light of the Spirit,

278
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:37,080
it fills you up with complete joy,

279
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:42,080
and joy has not two sides like happiness and unhappiness.

280
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:47,680
It's singular, it's absolute and you are then,

281
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:55,240
they say they are swimming in the ocean of joy.

282
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,080
So beautiful it is.

283
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:04,760
This new race, we can call it.

284
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:08,200
The new society, is already formed.

285
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:12,120
It's there, they're angel-like people, beautiful.

286
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:15,200
I never tell them, don't drink, don't smoke,

287
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,680
don't take drugs, nothing of the kind. I don't tell them,

288
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,240
it just automatically drops out

289
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,320
because in the light they see the ignorance that they had.

290
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,920
They see the darkness and they just drop it.

291
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,760
We don't have to tell them anything,

292
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:35,400
not to brainwash them or anything; it just works automatically.

293
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:38,000
You don't have to follow any kind

294
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,240
of a fundamental groups or things, nothing of the kind.

295
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:46,360
You just know this is fundamental because you have got

296
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:49,360
the light within you, then they see the goodness,

297
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,920
then they see the oneness of all the religions.

298
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,520
So if you know the oneness of all the religions,

299
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,600
why will you be fundamentalist?

300
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:00,800
If you belong to one organization or to another church

301
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,680
or to another religion then you fight.

302
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,280
When you get into compartments like this, then only you fight.

303
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,240
Everybody thinks we are the chosen ones,

304
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,720
that's how we have this fundamentalism now,

305
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:17,680
knocking at our doors. So to get rid of it

306
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,680
the best thing is. First of all

307
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,160
you have to become a universal being,

308
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,200
and this Spirit is the Universal Being.

309
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,160
Once you become the Universal Being

310
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,200
then you will be surprised to see it,

311
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:33,600
that all these differences you saw because of complete ignorance.

312
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,240
For example there is light you can see each other here,

313
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,040
but supposing there is complete pitch darkness,

314
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:43,840
you don't know who's sitting here, who is right, who is left..

315
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,160
You don't know how to walk.

316
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:48,440
You may trample over people, you may just get frightened,

317
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,960
you may run helter skelter.

318
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,000
But if there is light you see things so clearly.

319
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,160
In the same way Sahaja Yoga works first.

320
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:00,240
Some people get not all the light I should say,

321
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,920
but they do get a little light, a glimmer of light,

322
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,440
and then it starts expanding. And when it expands

323
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:10,360
you will be amazed how things work out.

324
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:13,440
Also I have seen people after coming to Sahaja Yoga,

325
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,120
they become extremely intelligent, absorbent,

326
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,640
and a kind of a very dynamic personality comes in them.

327
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:24,040
Now you have seen these Australians singing Sanskrit songs.

328
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,320
I mean imagine, Sanskrit,

329
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:29,400
even these English lived in India for 300 years,

330
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:32,120
they couldn't learn one sentence of Hindi language,

331
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:36,440
leave alone Sanskrit, but the way they are singing with such

332
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,320
clarity, even the Indians are surprised

333
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:42,760
at how they are singing our songs in Sanskrit language.

334
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,360
It is an impossibility,

335
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:48,000
you cannot think of a Western person singing like this

336
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,400
with all the rhythm and the melody and all that

337
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:54,000
and in no time they pick it up.

338
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:58,440
There are artists and artists who have now got world fame in India

339
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,920
after coming to Sahaja Yoga. We have got here also

340
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:06,960
some artists who were painters and have become very,

341
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:11,080
have got a good name for themselves. Everything changes.

342
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:14,920
You become on top of the world but you don't become competitive,

343
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,280
you start enjoying each other.

344
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,320
Such a brotherhood, such love, such friendship,

345
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:27,600
that you become one drop becoming an ocean,

346
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,720
microcosm becoming the macrocosm.

347
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,920
We talk about these things but we have never achieved it.

348
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:39,560
Now the time has come for us to achieve all this.

349
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,760
In this one lecture I know I can't talk much.

350
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:45,280
Last year also I was here

351
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,760
and Lord Mayor was here also to grace the occasion.

352
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:51,720
I found him to be a remarkable person,

353
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,280
the way he got his realization.

354
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,600
You are especially blessed people I think,

355
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:00,480
Newcastle with this beautiful lake here

356
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,960
and beautiful surroundings, and I hope that

357
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,560
