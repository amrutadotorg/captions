00:00:08.199 --> 00:00:15.762
So where is the attention placed in the human being?

00:00:15.842 --> 00:00:19.422
It is not a fixed point.

00:00:20.594 --> 00:00:32.461
You can say, attention is the surface or the edge of awareness.

00:00:37.715 --> 00:00:46.425
Wherever we are made aware, the attention gets diverted to that point.

00:00:56.477 --> 00:01:05.885
If you can find some analogy,

00:01:05.965 --> 00:01:12.219
all the files (filings) of iron

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:19.652
have got a power to be attracted towards the magnet.

00:01:23.084 --> 00:01:28.290
Where is that power, you cannot locate – it is all over.

00:01:28.382 --> 00:01:35.581
Wherever the magnet is placed the files are attracted.

00:01:35.702 --> 00:01:41.070
Our attention is also like that,

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:47.814
that wherever we are attracted, our attention goes there.

00:01:51.204 --> 00:01:56.938
It is existing in the whole body,

00:01:57.018 --> 00:02:02.269
in the sense that it can be diverted anywhere, outside the body.

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:10.971
Also inside the body, in case if there is any pain or there is any trouble.

00:02:15.925 --> 00:02:23.549
It floats over the nerves,

00:02:24.308 --> 00:02:29.865
it floats over the whole nervous system,

00:02:33.492 --> 00:02:41.438
but there is a controlling centre in the brain.

00:02:42.891 --> 00:02:57.084
If it is hit then we can remain conscious, but without any attention.

00:03:02.852 --> 00:03:11.405
Also, if somebody is hit on the Vishuddhi Chakra, it can happen.

00:03:11.485 --> 00:03:16.452
It can happen even in the lower chakras if somebody is hit.

00:03:16.532 --> 00:03:30.645
That portion will lose its attention because you cannot feel, in that part.

00:03:32.158 --> 00:03:43.598
The difference is this, that you can pay attention to those points,

00:03:43.678 --> 00:03:46.005
if you want to, even if they are numbed.

00:03:46.085 --> 00:03:49.878
For example, if my hand is numb I can pay attention to that,

00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:54.612
means I can look at it, I can think of it,

00:03:54.692 --> 00:04:04.195
but there is a point in our being [which], if that is hit

00:04:04.275 --> 00:04:11.025
then we cannot even think, we are just lying unconscious they say,

00:04:11.105 --> 00:04:17.132
but eyes are open, hands are moving, legs are moving.

00:04:17.212 --> 00:04:24.452
That point is at the point of Vishuddhi Chakra here.

00:04:24.532 --> 00:04:29.572
And if yo u can draw a line from here

00:04:29.652 --> 00:04:41.555
to the point where is the peetha of Vishuddhi Chakra is inside, inside the brain;

00:04:43.712 --> 00:04:52.132
along that line if you are hit anywhere you become attention-less,

00:04:52.212 --> 00:04:54.805
you cannot pay attention anywhere.

00:05:07.832 --> 00:05:19.295
This line passes through, also, Agya Chakra.

00:05:20.075 --> 00:05:28.198
Because when this point is connected with Vishuddhi Chakra at the back,

00:05:28.278 --> 00:05:35.278
in here, and at the peetha inside, then a kind of a triangle is formed

00:05:35.358 --> 00:05:42.175
and all this line or this area can affect your attention.

00:05:43.805 --> 00:05:48.998
Your heart is moving, your limbs are moving

00:05:49.078 --> 00:05:53.075
but you are not paying attention anywhere.

00:06:07.085 --> 00:06:18.452
So when you pay attention to something, actually you pay attention, normally

00:06:20.778 --> 00:06:24.345
– when you are not realised –

00:06:24.425 --> 00:06:27.495
through your brain centres.

00:06:30.875 --> 00:06:41.018
After realisation, you can pay attention 
through your other centres also. You do pay.

00:06:43.125 --> 00:06:48.935
This is a very big difference between a person 
who is realised and who is not realised.

00:06:53.545 --> 00:06:57.092
Or you can say that you can become effective

00:06:57.172 --> 00:07:01.335
through your other centres by paying attention to them.

00:07:04.745 --> 00:07:12.635
You can feel the centres which are obstructed in your body, 
which you never felt before.

00:07:14.598 --> 00:07:20.225
Not only that, but you can feel the centres of other people.

00:07:20.305 --> 00:07:32.075
That means your central nervous system is being blessed by a new awareness

00:07:32.172 --> 00:07:38.592
by which it can convey to you, communicate to you,

00:07:38.672 --> 00:07:44.445
the attention paid by your centres and also it can take your attention

00:07:44.525 --> 00:07:49.772
in a subtler way into the centres of others.

00:07:50.505 --> 00:07:57.835
So, first thing that happens to you is that your attention becomes subtler.

00:08:00.598 --> 00:08:12.135
Attention becoming subtler means you start understanding deeper things.

00:08:13.635 --> 00:08:23.692
For example, a bird can see a flower but cannot feel the beauty of a flower.

00:08:26.185 --> 00:08:33.232
And a unrealised person can see the beauty of a flower,

00:08:33.312 --> 00:08:37.695
but cannot see the vibrations of the flower.

00:08:39.498 --> 00:08:47.535
So you become subtler, your attention becomes subtler.

00:08:52.672 --> 00:08:59.552
You definitely are at a higher evolutionary stage than the other people are.
