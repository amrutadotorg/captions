00:08.199 --> 00:15.762
So where is the attention placed in the human being?

00:15.842 --> 00:19.422
It is not a fixed point.

00:20.594 --> 00:32.461
You can say, attention is the surface or the edge of awareness.

00:37.715 --> 00:46.425
Wherever we are made aware, the attention gets diverted to that point.

00:56.477 --> 01:05.885
If you can find some analogy,

01:05.965 --> 01:12.219
all the files (filings) of iron

01:12.299 --> 01:19.652
have got a power to be attracted towards the magnet.

01:23.084 --> 01:28.290
Where is that power, you cannot locate – it is all over.

01:28.382 --> 01:35.581
Wherever the magnet is placed the files are attracted.

01:35.702 --> 01:41.070
Our attention is also like that,

01:41.210 --> 01:47.814
that wherever we are attracted, our attention goes there.

01:51.204 --> 01:56.938
It is existing in the whole body,

01:57.018 --> 02:02.269
in the sense that it can be diverted anywhere, outside the body.

02:02.350 --> 02:10.971
Also inside the body, in case if there is any pain or there is any trouble.

02:15.925 --> 02:23.549
It floats over the nerves,

02:24.308 --> 02:29.865
it floats over the whole nervous system,

02:33.492 --> 02:41.438
but there is a controlling centre in the brain.

02:42.891 --> 02:57.084
If it is hit then we can remain conscious, but without any attention.

03:02.852 --> 03:11.405
Also, if somebody is hit on the Vishuddhi Chakra, it can happen.

03:11.485 --> 03:16.452
It can happen even in the lower chakras if somebody is hit.

03:16.532 --> 03:30.645
That portion will lose its attention because you cannot feel, in that part.

03:32.158 --> 03:43.598
The difference is this, that you can pay attention to those points,

03:43.678 --> 03:46.005
if you want to, even if they are numbed.

03:46.085 --> 03:49.878
For example, if my hand is numb I can pay attention to that,

03:49.958 --> 03:54.612
means I can look at it, I can think of it,

03:54.692 --> 04:04.195
but there is a point in our being [which], if that is hit

04:04.275 --> 04:11.025
then we cannot even think, we are just lying unconscious they say,

04:11.105 --> 04:17.132
but eyes are open, hands are moving, legs are moving.

04:17.212 --> 04:24.452
That point is at the point of Vishuddhi Chakra here.

04:24.532 --> 04:29.572
And if yo u can draw a line from here

04:29.652 --> 04:41.555
to the point where is the peetha of Vishuddhi Chakra is inside, inside the brain;

04:43.712 --> 04:52.132
along that line if you are hit anywhere you become attention-less,

04:52.212 --> 04:54.805
you cannot pay attention anywhere.

05:07.832 --> 05:19.295
This line passes through, also, Agya Chakra.

05:20.075 --> 05:28.198
Because when this point is connected with Vishuddhi Chakra at the back,

05:28.278 --> 05:35.278
in here, and at the peetha inside, then a kind of a triangle is formed

05:35.358 --> 05:42.175
and all this line or this area can affect your attention.

05:43.805 --> 05:48.998
Your heart is moving, your limbs are moving

05:49.078 --> 05:53.075
but you are not paying attention anywhere.

06:07.085 --> 06:18.452
So when you pay attention to something, actually you pay attention, normally

06:20.778 --> 06:24.345
– when you are not realised –

06:24.425 --> 06:27.495
through your brain centres.

06:30.875 --> 06:41.018
After realisation, you can pay attention
through your other centres also. You do pay.

06:43.125 --> 06:48.935
This is a very big difference between a person
who is realised and who is not realised.

06:53.545 --> 06:57.092
Or you can say that you can become effective

06:57.172 --> 07:01.335
through your other centres by paying attention to them.

07:04.745 --> 07:12.635
You can feel the centres which are obstructed in your body,
which you never felt before.

07:14.598 --> 07:20.225
Not only that, but you can feel the centres of other people.

07:20.305 --> 07:32.075
That means your central nervous system is being blessed by a new awareness

07:32.172 --> 07:38.592
by which it can convey to you, communicate to you,

07:38.672 --> 07:44.445
the attention paid by your centres and also it can take your attention

07:44.525 --> 07:49.772
in a subtler way into the centres of others.

07:50.505 --> 07:57.835
So, first thing that happens to you is that your attention becomes subtler.

08:00.598 --> 08:12.135
Attention becoming subtler means you start understanding deeper things.

08:13.635 --> 08:23.692
For example, a bird can see a flower but cannot feel the beauty of a flower.

08:26.185 --> 08:33.232
And a unrealised person can see the beauty of a flower,

08:33.312 --> 08:37.695
but cannot see the vibrations of the flower.

08:39.498 --> 08:47.535
So you become subtler, your attention becomes subtler.

08:52.672 --> 08:59.552
You definitely are at a higher evolutionary stage than the other people are.
