00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.280
1991-0410 Virata Puja, Melbourne, Australia

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.000
Because of distances and

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.800
also that we have no ashram  in Melbourne all these days;

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.520
I've found that the collectivity is no yet

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.880
properly woven here.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.320
So I think that the best thing is today

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.360
we must worship the Virata.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.200
Virata is the primordial father, you can say,

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.280
or the one who is in our brain acts

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.600
for our collectivity.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.840
As the Kundalini rises ultimately she ends up

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.840
by piercing through the fontanel bone area.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.880
Before entering into that

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.360
she enters into the Sahasrara.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.560
Sahasrara is the area

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.360
which is surrounded by

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.640
one thousand nerves

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.920
and in the medical terms

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.920
it is called as limbic area.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.800
Now one thousand nerves

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.680
are all connected

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:35.520
to the sixteen important nerves of the Vishuddhi.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.240
That's why they say that Shri Krishna had

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.480
sixteen thousand wives, that is,

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.520
He had all His powers as His wives

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.920
and I have all My powers as My children.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.840
So when we are growing in our ascent,

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.960
in our dhyana,

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:06.840
we have to go to our Sahasrara.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.480
If the Sahasrara was not opened out,

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.560
we could not have done this en masse realization.

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.560
How it is connected,

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.360
the collectivity is so connected

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.920
with the present-day Sahaja Yoga.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.120
Before that it was just

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.360
up to the Agnya chakra

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.720
but when it reaches the Sahasrara

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.080
it enlightens all the nerves,

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.840
and all the nerves look like

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.160
flames which are very silent,

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.040
beautifully colored in all vigor colors.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.040
The

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.240
appearance of these is so soothing and so beautiful

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.840
that there's no better view in the whole world, I think,

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.080
that human beings can see.

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.360
So when this Sahasrara was opened out,

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.520
which we are having now a puja as you know,

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.720
in Rome

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.440
before that it had to go to the collective,

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.280
that is, I had to pay My attention to the collective.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.160
I had to see the people,

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.400
their different problems,

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.800
the permutations and combinations

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.520
by which they are all suffering.

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.680
They can all be brought to the seven major

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.560
notes, we can say,

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:04.200
but they are also divided into twenty-one -

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.840
one on the left, one on the right and one in the center.

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.480
So we have also gather twenty-one

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.200
really basic problems,

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.320
fundamental problems within us

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.600
which we have to solve.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.840
We have, in the beginning of Sahaja Yoga,

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:23.440
I tried only to cure people of their physical problems,

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.280
mental problems, their family problems, financial problems,

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.640
all kinds of problems have been solved

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.960
in Sahaja Yoga,

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.720
and we have had some very great mishaps in between.

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.840
As you know that when they came up to the Agnya

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.040
they started taking over

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.680
the whole atmosphere

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.720
by some sort of a authority

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.760
which was not God's authority.

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:58.080
As a result, many people went out at the Agnya

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:02.840
but those who have come to Sahasrara have to understand

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:08.440
that collectivity is the basic of your ascent.

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.160
If you are not collective,

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.840
if you do not come to the center,

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.840
if you do not meet each other,

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:22.720
then you are like a nail which is cut out of the finger and

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.720
the Divine has nothing to do with you - you are out of the tree,

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:33.320
like the flowers which have come out of the tree

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.440
can exist for a while, no doubt,

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:40.240
but after some time they are dead and finished.

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.560
So it is important for all of you to understand

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:48.640
that collectivity, if it is not established in Sahaja Yoga,

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.400
Sahaja Yoga will die out.

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:55.720
I am now going to America where collectivity

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.080
has to be really of the maximum nature,

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.440
but it is not so.

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:06.040
There are so many problems on collectivity in America,

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.800
but still I would say that they realize one thing,

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.280
that they have to be very collective.

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.320
The problems are like there are very few people

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.480
who are Sahaja Yogis there,

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.640
but among themselves

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:23.440
they understand responsibility. They are all working very hard.

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:25.960
They are spreading Sahaja Yoga.

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:29.880
Now you see the have this ''Cool Breeze'' started from there,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.800
there are so many activities they are doing in America

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:36.680
with such a small number that it is amazing

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.040
how they are managing these things,

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.240
and they do it very beautifully

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.960
because they feel joined together; they are so far away,

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:48.560
from Honolulu to New York is such a long distance.

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:52.000
But there's such a lot of understanding,

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.320
such a lot of love

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.800
and sense of responsibility.

00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:00.720
Because they are a small number they feel extremely responsible

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:03.680
that we have to be absolutely collective

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:06.680
- no question of having groups.

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.280
Even if somebody makes mistakes or something,

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:14.200
they never talk about it to anybody else but to Me.

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:17.360
They never discuss about each other,

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:19.960
they never talk ill about each other,

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:22.360
they never form any groups.

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:26.320
The children are outside. Who are? Just they can came here, there is space.

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:30.360
Can you have little bit up in there?

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:35.200
Just make them space in between. Come along!

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.760
Children can sit in the front they don't occupate much space.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.600
Children can even sit on your laps.

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:08.200
Can you move?

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:11.160
You can make a gap in between.

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:15.800
Now, this is question of collectivity.

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:22.440
Bring the children up here.

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:26.400
All the children can come along, they can help me in puja

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:28.960
they are very good at helping.

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:30.040
yes.

00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:45.560
Yes, yes, come along.

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:51.880
Poor children were kept out, can you imagine?

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:01.320
Sit down, sit down, sit down.

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:10.160
Sit down, sit down, here, sit down. Now.

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:15.240
Come along, come along, come here, come here.

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:27.120
Now, who are outside now?

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.160
See if small children are there.

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:44.320
Come along, come along.

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:52.680
I think if you could sit little, not with such a big

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:55.160
assan, little smaller assan

00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:57.800
People can come.

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:02.760
And I think open a window also is important

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:10.960
Yes there is some space

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:13.160
if there are tree cameras,

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:15.640
then how can't there be space.

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:20.200
I think you can have one camera in there

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:22.200
and they can sit inside.

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:24.440
All right.

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:32.240
All right.

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:55.110
You all should sit with one

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:58.560
one knee up like that so there is more space

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:00.800
just like Babamama is sitting.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.200
Give it to in Chaaya's lap.

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:34.240
Don't spread out your self, little bit

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:37.120
pull your one leg like that on top.

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:39.960
Yes, one straight one like this

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:42.360
even easier to sit that way.

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:49.720
Easier to sit.

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:58.120
Now this is the sense of collectivity,

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:01.880
that it's in a small hall - doesn't matter -

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.120
we are all together,

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:07.760
and how are we going to get all of them inside,

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:10.760
because you can't enjoy it

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:14.120
unless and until all of you are together.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.560
Now, everybody has to keep quiet, all right children

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:25.280
all of you, otherwise they will ask you again to go out.

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:31.960
So now, let us see how do we

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:37.600
miss out on collectivity.

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:43.440
There's a very practical down-to-earth

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:45.520
understanding.

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:51.280
First we must know without collectivity we cannot exist.

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:58.160
As the body has to be in connection with the brain,

00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:01.120
in the same way without collectivity

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:03.760
Sahaja Yoga cannot exist.

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:09.560
Once you understand that,

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:12.320
then you have to work it out that collectivity

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:16.960
is absolutely established within and without.

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:21.000
It is more within that you have to establish,

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:22.640
than without.

00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:29.360
Whatever you have within is manifested outside.

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:35.200
Now how do we establish it within ourselves?

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:41.040
First of all,

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:46.680
we have to understand

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:51.240
that now we are the relations of each other.

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:55.920
Gyaneshwari said, "TechiSoyarikhoti."

00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:26.320
So the first thing is that within ourselves

00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:31.040
we have to see introspection, with introspection,

00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:36.200
what are we doing against collectivity in our mind,

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:40.040
how our mind is working.

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:44.840
I do not know

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:48.400
what thing comes first in the human mind

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:50.960
about another person,

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:53.320
but the first thing is that

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:56.440
these are your real relations

00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:03.200
and nobody else are your relations.

00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:06.600
These children are your children

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:11.200
and these men are your brothers,

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:13.520
and these ladies are your sisters,

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:17.440
and we are one big family together.

00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:23.400
We are part and parcel of one body,

00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:28.960
and this hand cannot hit another hand,

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:32.360
thank God it doesn't think, otherwise as human beings

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:36.240
they might start thinking against another hand,

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:37.640
but they don't

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:42.320
because they are connected to one brain activity.

00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:47.840
So the first thing one has to understand

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:52.840
that do not try to see the defects of another person,

00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:57.120
but goodness of another person.

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:03.280
That is really going to help you the most.

00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:05.240
Like in India, you see, I don't know,

00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:11.120
here maybe the same: if you, if they know you,

00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:14.760
supposing, immediately they'll find out,

00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:18.240
now what work can we take out of this person.

00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:20.200
If somebody is a minister's brother,

00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:22.640
immediately they'll approach the minister's brother.

00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:25.120
All right, "Will you do this work for me?"

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:27.600
Then somebody says, "l am such-and-such .. ."

00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:29.600
immediately people will think,

00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:33.280
"Oh, so what, what work can we get out of this person?"

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.800
In the same way you can go little further

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:39.840
in the language of Sahaja Yoga.

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:42.040
As soon as you come to know about someone,

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:45.880
you should not think what business I can do with him.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.200
I have seen immediately if somebody has money

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:52.040
people will jump at him, all right, let's have the business together,

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:54.400
even in Sahaja Yoga.

00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:57.680
Or if there is anything like that immediately they

00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:00.960
start employing that person for your purpose.

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:07.520
On the contrary, what you have to do

00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:10.160
as soon as you know about somebody,

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:14.360
then you have to think what goodness he has got,

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:18.440
how can I imbibe that goodness within myself?

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:24.320
Because we are here to enrich ourselves spiritually.

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:30.400
So you must think as first and foremost thing,

00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:33.880
"What can I do to get

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.800
the goodness of that person within myself?"

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:40.680
So you'll be looking out

00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:42.480
for the goodness of that person

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:46.520
than instead of looking out for bad qualities,

00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:50.760
because bad qualities are not going to nourish you at all.

00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:54.360
Also if somebody has bad qualities,

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:57.360
no use thinking about you yourself

00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:59.720
because if you start thinking about it

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:02.280
they are not going to be improved,

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:05.120
it is somebody else's problem.

00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:09.600
The best thing is to look at another person

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:12.320
with adoration and understanding,

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:17.240
with love that he is one of us and what can I use?

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:19.520
Now if I have the hand I don't have to think

00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:21.640
because we are programmed that way.

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:23.800
If I have to hold this, automatically

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:27.840
I use My hand, not My feet, I know My hands are holding,

00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:31.520
but when I have to walk, I don't walk with My hands

00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:33.840
because I know My feet have to walk.

00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:39.160
In the same way, you have to know which Sahaja Yogi

00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:46.280
is going to help you to nourish yourself.

00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:52.480
Immediately your mind will become very clear.

00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:57.080
Like now I saw some boy in

00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:00.280
New Zealand

00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:04.320
who was really about to be dead,

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:11.680
and when he came back I found the
attitude towards him was not kind,

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.880
as it should have been,

00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:19.720
but this is the best chance when you should see

00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:23.400
how you can practice your compassion.

00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:26.800
We talk of compassion, compassion.

00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:30.120
Now let us see how we can practice our compassion

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:32.160
when this boy is so sick.

00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:35.000
On the contrary, everybody was harsh on him,

00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:39.800
they were passing remarks at him, doing things like that.

00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:44.840
Because we have to have compassion,

00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:47.840
now Mother has said we have to have compassion,

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:50.120
well now where do we have our compassion, on the walls?

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:52.400
Where do we use our compassion?

00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:55.120
Where do we use our compassion?

00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:59.280
So Sahaja Yoga is to be practiced, doesn't mean that you sit down

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:03.080
with My photograph all the time, doesn't mean that.

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:07.160
It means you practice compassion;

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:09.840
you practice that.

00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:14.360
Then you have to practice love.

00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:17.440
Now how do you practice love with others?

00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:20.440
If you love someone, what do you do?

00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:22.960
You try to please that person.

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:28.080
Small things can make people very happy.

00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:30.280
I know, you all try to please Me very much,

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:31.720
you give Me presents,

00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:34.080
you find out things which are good for Me,

00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:37.080
you go out of the way buy sweet flowers for Me,

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:39.160
beautiful things you do to please Me.

00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:41.760
I am over-pleased, I must tell you,

00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:46.840
but I am more pleased, much more pleased

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:49.080
if you understand collectivity

00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:52.440
and try to please each other.

00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:55.280
Such a person pleases Me the most

00:21:55.400 --> 00:22:00.080
that the attention is more on pleasing each other.

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:04.800
As soon as you decide you have to please others,

00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:06.960
your tongue will become different.

00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:09.640
It will become much sweeter.

00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:13.400
The tongue which was like a pair of scissors

00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:16.880
becomes such a beautiful thing of honey.

00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:19.200
Then you talk little but

00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:21.400
you really pour honey on another person,

00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:25.120
so to the another person really enjoys it.

00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:28.880
So now the practice love where do you practice?

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:32.040
Ask you a question: where do I practice love?

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:36.480
What do I love?

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.080
We live, love our house,

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:41.280
we love our photographs,

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:43.280
our decorations, everything,

00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:46.440
but do I practice this love on my wife,

00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:50.560
or on my husband,

00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:54.000
or on other Sahaja Yogis?

00:22:57.280 --> 00:22:59.000
In our Sahaj culture

00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:03.680
we have to practice compassion and love,

00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:10.280
and thirdly we have to practice patience.

00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:14.520
I know some children are maybe

00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:18.000
little more mischievous ... and others less mischievous,

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:20.840
maybe some people are very talkative,

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:24.200
sometimes really they give Me also headache;

00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:27.320
they go on talking, talking, talking, talking, so much!

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:30.360
Sometimes I think it's good

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:32.800
because it's a rest for My mouth:

00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:36.760
one way of looking at it.

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:39.840
Another way of looking at it is just switch off your mind,

00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:42.680
let him talk, take it out whatever it was.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.840
Once he is finished with it and fagged out

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:50.680
then he won't bother you much

00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:52.480
and also he'll feel satisfied

00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:55.680
that somebody has listened to his prattles.

00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:57.880
So patience is needed

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.480
and patience is needed

00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:05.720
in such a way that others should see your patience.

00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:08.560
Yesterday for example, I was sitting for about I think

00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:12.320
three hours shaking hands with all sorts of people

00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:15.880
and all types of problems,

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:19.520
and the person who came last, he said,

00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:23.640
"Looking at Your patience, I develop my own patience."

00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:30.120
And love gives you patience.

00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:34.320
This love nourishes you.

00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:39.840
I'm telling you, it's absolutely down-to-earth method:

00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:42.640
here I've not mentioned that you trust God,

00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:45.160
I am just saying trust yourself.

00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:47.240
Absolutely down-to-earth

00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:50.520
because we are talking about your brain.

00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:53.640
Now we have been saying

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:56.360
that we have to forgive everyone,

00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:59.200
but we don't practice that.

00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:04.000
Small, small things like mad people we remember,

00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:07.720
that only I have heard that snake has this capacity

00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:10.200
to remember if somebody has hurt him,

00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:13.920
but here I find human beings have no less capacity.

00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:16.160
Whatever has happened 13 years back,

00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:17.920
15 years back, they all remember

00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:20.840
- each and every thing: whatever has hurt them,

00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:24.760
but how they have hurt others they don't remember,

00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:26.680
how they have been nasty to others

00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:28.560
they don't remember,

00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:31.360
because this is a human

00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:34.040
mind which has got the ego

00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:37.760
it can go on hurting others, it doesn't feel anything,

00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:41.320
and the superego which goes on receiving all the hurts

00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:45.040
and always complaining about it.

00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:51.680
So it is for you to realize

00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:56.000
that you are the one who is breaking

00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:59.760
the collectivity.

00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:03.360
First of all, we had horrible leaders here,

00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:06.280
that's how our collectivity was very poor

00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:11.160
but now we are getting soberer people, better people.

00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:15.640
Also for Melbourne I am thinking of getting

00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:18.960
somebody elderly for you to be the leader

00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:24.160
because I think Greg is full with responsibility.

00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:26.360
So, I thought of Henshaw

00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:29.120
and I asked him and he has agreed.

00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:31.720
So now in Melbourne we'll have somebody

00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:35.400
staying in the ashram, who is a retired man, who'll look after you,

00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:38.360
will do everything that is possible

00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:42.240
to look after the collectivity of Melbourne.

00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:47.640
But you have to know that

00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:50.880
I have one connection with you

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.840
through your leader.

00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:58.840
That doesn't mean you cannot connect.

00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:02.200
Like supposing there's a pin

00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:05.000
and you put the pin to Me, immediately My hand will go off

00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:07.520
- means there's a reflex action also,

00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:10.120
but mostly everything is reported to the brain.

00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:14.360
In the same way, everything should be reported to the brain

00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:18.240
but from the very beginning if you develop a kind of

00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:22.000
a criticizing attitude towards your leader,

00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:25.480
then it becomes very difficult

00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:28.400
- for the leader as well as for you.

00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:30.640
First you should not criticize.

00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:33.040
Don't use your brain for criticism,

00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:37.560
already criticism has been too much in the West.

00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:41.720
I mean, now they have got now technique of criticizing.

00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:45.680
All the art is finished because of the critics.

00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:48.360
The artists are afraid to show their paintings,

00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:50.880
artists are afraid to show their creations

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:52.760
because they will be criticized.

00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:57.000
Now the only thing that is left are critics, critics, critics,

00:27:57.120 --> 00:28:01.040
and the critics are criticizing critics, that's all.

00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:04.960
There is no creativity, nothing.

00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:07.640
So try to appreciate everything.

00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:11.600
Children are producing pictures, paintings anyway.

00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:16.400
They make sometimes My faces very funny

00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:19.360
when they draw - not the children, even grownups.

00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:21.120
Doesn't matter, I appreciate it,

00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:24.120
it's very good, wonderful, very nice,

00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:26.560
to encourage that person.

00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:29.520
So criticism should go out of our mind,

00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:33.080
but appreciation should be practiced:

00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:37.320
appreciation of others' children,

00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:42.000
appreciation of other people is very important

00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:45.480
but that doesn't mean that you appreciate all others

00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:49.360
and torture your wife or torture your husband

00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:51.880
- that also is an imbalance.

00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:55.120
First responsibility is your family

00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:58.200
but you should appreciate others,

00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:03.000
and this comes when you have no jealousies about anyone.

00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:05.840
This jealousy I don't know from where it comes,

00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:10.720
I don't know this quality of jealousy, why there is jealousy.

00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:14.520
So, also if you have jealousy you have to use it

00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:16.920
for the right purpose,

00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:18.640
and what is the right purpose

00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:20.960
is that you should be jealous of a person

00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:23.160
who is spiritually higher than you,

00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:26.640
and you practice it that you become better.

00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:28.920
If jealousy is for competition,

00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:31.160
then you compete with the person

00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:36.080
who is more compassionate, more loving,

00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:39.240
more sacrificing, more patient.

00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:45.920
So this competition becomes a very healthy competition

00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:49.840
and the collectivity becomes very nourished.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:55.760
Now try to feel that you are all
part and parcel of one personality.

00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:01.440
Try to understand this and practice this.

00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:04.320
This will help you a lot.

00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:09.840
Little things like buying a little present for someone.

00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:11.960
You see something, "Oh,

00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:15.440
this will be very nice for this person."

00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:18.240
We have officially decided

00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:20.480
that the men should not give presents to women

00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:23.320
and women should not give presents to men,

00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:26.600
but if she is your sister, rakhi sister you can give

00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:29.720
and the rakhi sister can give to the brother,

00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:31.640
but otherwise one should not do that.

00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:35.920
We have done it because I have seen it creates problems,

00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:38.760
but that doesn't mean you hate women or hate men.

00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:43.200
But a distance has to be maintained of purity

00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:46.360
till you become completely innocent

00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:49.760
is better is to keep that distance.

00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:58.040
This purity is to be practiced

00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:03.080
and this practice of purity is that

00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:09.240
you try to develop your innocent feelings towards others.

00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:13.280
In innocence everything comes,

00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:16.600
everything comes in innocence.

00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:18.920
If you are innocent

00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:22.960
you will immediately become

00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:25.680
a very good Sahaja Yogi

00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:28.480
but it has so many facets.

00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:31.800
Like the other day there was one girl she was fighting

00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:35.880
for getting some sort of a sweet,

00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:40.840
and they were distributing the prasads.

00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:43.760
So I gave her one of the small plates, I said, "You distribute."

00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:46.200
Immediately she forgot what she wanted,

00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:49.720
she started distributing very sweetly with little, little hands

00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:53.160
the prasad to everyone, very sweet.

00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:57.880
So this has to be practiced from childhood,

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.480
with your children you have to tell them, "Alright,

00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:03.560
let's do these things, distribute this to people,

00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:06.040
go and put kumkum on their heads"

00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:08.400
- they may not do it well, but doesn't matter.

00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:10.720
They will learn how to meet others,

00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:14.280
how to talk to them, how to be with others.

00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:19.720
Now the worst enemy of collectivity is aggressiveness.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.600
Some people are basically aggressive;

00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:25.880
their style of talking is extremely aggressive.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.680
The way they say things is aggressive,

00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:33.560
maybe because anything, maybe they are better educated,

00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:37.640
maybe they come from a very aggressive family,

00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:43.000
maybe they are having a kind of a superiority complex

00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:46.960
or an inferiority complex or a sense of insecurity,

00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:50.080
or maybe they are possessed.

00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:54.640
They try to dominate and show their very strong

00:32:54.760 --> 00:33:01.640
feelings towards people of superiority.

00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:07.040
They may be inferior, it's not necessary, but they do

00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:10.280
and this is something is to be curbed.

00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:15.640
So what you have to practice here is humility:

00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:17.480
try to be humble.

00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:21.520
There was a joke like this, that

00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:24.880
one gentleman was going on the staircase

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:28.160
and another was coming from the top.

00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:35.240
So this gentleman who was going up there

00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:39.480
said to the other that, "Please move."

00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:43.040
So he said, "l don't move for fools."

00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:45.480
The person who was climbing up, he said,

00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:49.240
"But I do" and he moved out.

00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:53.560
That's how the humility works.

00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:58.720
You have to be humble in your approach to others.

00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:03.360
I mean, English language is outwardly very humble,

00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:06.600
like you must say "please" you must say "thank you" ten times,

00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:09.960
please, please, please, thank you, thank you, thank you,

00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:11.960
but not in the heart.

00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:14.440
Like supposing somebody doesn't say thank you,

00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:16.320
the other person may even beat you.

00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:18.920
"Why didn't you say 'thank you' to me?"

00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:22.280
This is not humility.

00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:29.080
Humility is that in no way you try to aggress others,

00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:31.160
and if others are aggressive

00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:34.160
you accept it as a childish thing,

00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:38.960
as a stupid thing, as a foolish thing, it has no meaning:

00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:43.000
because you are so powerful, you can bear it.

00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:46.960
That is humility which you have to practice

00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:50.640
and all these qualities if you have,

00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:55.680
you will really be surprised

00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:58.560
that you will lose your selfishness.

00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:01.080
Your selfishness will start dropping out

00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:06.480
because selfishness how ugly it is

00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:08.760
you start realizing very soon

00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:12.240
when you become generous.

00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:15.800
So you practice your generosity.

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.760
You are all willing to spend lot of money on Me, I know.

00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:21.120
You want to give Me presents - I've stopped it now -

00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:24.200
that individually you cannot give Me any presents or anything,

00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:27.480
but generosity is a general term:

00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:30.600
generosity of kindness,

00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:33.480
generosity of compassion,

00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:36.200
generosity of patience,

00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:40.000
and generosity of material things.

00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:44.120
If I see something, immediately I think,

00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:47.040
"Oh, I should take this because I know l can give it

00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:49.280
to this lady or to this gentleman this thing,

00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:51.760
or I could give it to this purpose

00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:53.440
or for this organization

00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:56.040
or for this kind of a work we are doing."

00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:57.800
Immediately it comes to Me.

00:35:57.920 --> 00:36:02.160
You'd be surprised that if I'm in the market

00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:05.080
and if I'm thirsty, I don't even think

00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:09.800
that I should go and buy some soft drink for Myself

00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:12.160
- doesn't come into mind.

00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:16.760
Even I have never opened My 'fridge in My lifetime,

00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:20.560
but for others I'll run about, I'll cook for them,

00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:23.960
but supposing I'm in the house and there's no cook,

00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:28.600
I'll not cook for Myself - it's all right. If there's nobody in the house,

00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:31.320
if My husband is not there, I will not eat for two/three days

00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:34.280
and then servants, servant will complain to My husband

00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:37.640
then I remember, really, I didn't eat any food? I didn't know.

00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:40.160
If I am eating I am just eating because he is there,

00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:41.960
so I have to eat with him.

00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:44.280
I never used to take tea

00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:47.360
but because he is so much fond of tea,

00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:49.680
I started, so I keep the practice

00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:52.280
so that I should not give it the practice up.

00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:54.880
Later on it will be difficult

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.840
it just adjusting yourself to others,

00:36:57.960 --> 00:36:59.760
it's not difficult.

00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:04.560
Few things here and there that pleases, you should.

00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:06.800
There's no harm in trying to please.

00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:08.600
It's not only for the wife to do it,

00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:12.280
even the husband has to do something to please the wife

00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:14.280
- it's not only between husband and wife,

00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:16.080
it will be between children and you,

00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:18.240
between the whole family of Sahaja Yoga,

00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:22.320
it should be such that we should adjust.

00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:24.840
So practice your adjustments

00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:26.800
as you have to adjust your cameras.

00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:28.920
If you don't adjust the camera,

00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:31.400
you do not get the right picture. In the same way,

00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:33.840
unless and until you adjust yourself

00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:37.120
to the whole atmosphere, to a person,

00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:39.680
you cannot get the real picture,

00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:43.800
and then you start fighting with that.

00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:48.280
It is actually the fight has to be within yourself.

00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:50.280
It's quite a long, long story, I mean,

00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:52.200
as far as I know human beings

00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:57.080
and the problems of collectivity,

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:00.760
and certain problems are being solved now,

00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:04.800
I am happy about it, that people are not falling in love,

00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:08.120
I mean they are not falling and having a bump on their heads.

00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:12.200
But it's better now, they are taking it easy,

00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:16.040
thinking it over and are marrying a person

00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:20.360
for marriage sake and not for falling in love.

00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:22.360
There is something very great is happening

00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:25.400
because that would give you purification of mind

00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:28.240
and a mind which doesn't

00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:31.680
hover over nonsensical things.

00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:37.080
So as I said, practice all these things

00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:40.880
and your collectivity will be beautiful,

00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:46.280
and the best is to practice your meditation together.

00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:49.200
In Delhi we have started an ashram,

00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:51.840
every morning I find people coming,

00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:53.440
sitting together to meditate,

00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:55.920
it's like a temple, it's like a church.

00:38:56.040 --> 00:38:58.400
They come there and so many of them

00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:01.880
are sitting and meditating together.

00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:08.040
Meditating together is the best way to feel the collectivity.

00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:12.680
You can meditate at home, of course, you also cleanse it for your depth,

00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:14.880
but also you must meditate together

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:16.720
and when you meditate together

00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:20.720
then the strength that you have

00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:22.360
strengthens others,

00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:26.880
and the strength of the whole collectivity improves so much.

00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:30.320
You are meditating together is a very big thing.

00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:34.400
Everyone has to understand that whenever you get time

00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:36.840
you find out in the morning times, for example,

00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:39.640
we'll go to the ashram and meditate.

00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:43.160
Say, Sunday morning, we'll just go and meditate in the ashram.

00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:45.120
Just for meditation you have to come.

00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:46.920
Meditate and go away

00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:49.600
because I reside in this ashram,

00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:52.240
I am here, so leave your homes,

00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:54.680
come here and meditate.

00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:56.960
Meditation will help you a lot.

00:39:57.080 --> 00:40:00.560
Wherever you are together, I am with you

00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:05.520
but when you are away from each other, I am not with you.

00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:09.880
Only in difficulties, when you are pushed into some places

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:14.800
where I am not there, where you think I am not there, I am there.

00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:16.280
But

00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:19.800
if you deliberately are keeping out of collectivity,

00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:21.320
I am not with you,

00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:23.360
so try to grow your collectivity

00:40:23.480 --> 00:40:28.680
otherwise you cannot go deep into your own depths,

00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:30.600
you cannot become a great Sahaja Yogi,

00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:34.800
you cannot really be called a Sahaja Yogi.

00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:40.000
Those who have a sense of collectivity can only become that.

00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:45.440
So we have before us in Melbourne so many people

00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:49.520
and when the quantity increases, the quality should not fall down

00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:57.880
and the quality of collectivity has to be very strong

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:00.560
by having very strong bonds.

00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:03.040
I like when you praise someone.

00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:05.720
Normally I have seen whenever I am anywhere,

00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:07.920
people only talk about people who are negative,

00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:09.840
nobody talks about positive people,

00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:13.400
so I don't know about them, mostly I know who are negative.

00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:16.680
So I would love to know about people who are very positive,

00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:19.680
who are great, who are doing good things

00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:23.440
and forget about the negative - they'll drop out anyway.

00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:28.280
So best thing is to tell about the people who are positive,

00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:31.560
who are doing good work,

00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:35.360
who are real Sahaja Yogis.

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:38.400
I bless you all in Melbourne

00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:41.040
that you have a beautiful collectivity

00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:44.520
and enjoy yourself and every, every meeting

00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:47.920
should be a festival for you and an enjoyment.

00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:50.200
May God bless you!

00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:59.640
So thus today we have to worship Virata.

00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:01.320
He is nothing but Akbar

00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:05.840
who is Shri Krishna Himself becoming Virata.
