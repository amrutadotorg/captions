00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:13.680
Now the thing is our work is spreading very fast

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.190
and people are taking to it.

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.950
In Europe I find the land is much more fertile, surprisingly

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:32.190
and once people get realization, they become fantastic,

00:00:32.311 --> 00:00:35.469
I mean they think it’s something that they have been expecting

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:40.350
and they understand Sahaj Yoga much better than we understand here.

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.710
Though your Kundalinis rise very high, I’ve seen that,

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:51.830
but the progress is not that all right.

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.950
Now Ray has been to India, he’ll tell you how, what sort of people we have

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:00.270
in India and how they have progressed themselves.

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.590
Now as I said the main problem of our country is lethargy

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.870
and lethargy is something we have to overcome somehow

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:17.030
and this lethargy is a, actually a satanic force.

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.670
It’s not lethargy only of the matter

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:25.110
that comes from material domination on the Spirit,

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:33.350
but it is really satanic because it stops your progress and is to be avoided.

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.110
And to get out of it one has to be really

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.710
alert about it, how it crawls onto you.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.030
Krishna has put, the worst vice in the whole world is “aalasya”,

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:53.670
means lethargy. “Aalasyso Bijayate” – everything comes out of aalasya.

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.030
According to Him, first the lethargy comes in

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.950
and because of lethargy we get into vices

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.030
and then we go to the right side also because of lethargy.

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.710
Because just to avoid the lethargy we go to the right side too much.

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.350
So according to Him everything starts with lethargy

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:20.950
and then the person loses the essence of life through lethargy

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.590
and this is our special quality

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:29.190
and that is our real problem – is the lethargy.

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.950
Because Sahaj Yoga is a thing where we say there is “akriya”.

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.350
We don’t have to do anything. It is effortless.

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.470
Everything works out effortless, spontaneously.

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.590
So we think that everything is going to work out for us spontaneously.

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:52.950
Only the Kundalini Jagruti is spontaneous for the first time,

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.830
not for the second time, only for the first time.

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.750
That is I have to do it or My photograph has to do it.

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:07.390
But afterwards you have to work, you have to keep your Kundalini afloat.

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.950
You have to understand what are your problems,

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.190
what are you getting into.

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:19.230
I mean, individually every one of you is a masterpiece, individually.

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.830
Because of lethargy you are clouded.

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:30.390
Secondly because of lethargy you are secluded, lethargy gives you also ego.

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.950
Because anything that challenges lethargy

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:37.230
you get on top of that person, you don’t like such a person.

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.030
But the lethargy also those do not have

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.350
are the people their attention is not on spiritual development.

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.150
Theirs is as I told you yesterday, on other things,

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:49.950
which are not important to spiritual life.

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:55.670
We pay so much attention to other things than to our spiritual life.

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.710
Why is it? Why is it we pay more attention to material things,

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:06.350
to material comforts, to material achievements, to material obsessions?

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:09.230
Why? You must think about it.

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:11.950
And why not to our spiritual ascent?

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:15.950
The reason is we have been identified with matter.

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:21.350
We have been going through that circle.

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:25.230
We thought that we must have material development,

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:28.750
so we had industrial revolution,

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:34.190
we created a society dominated by industries, machinery came up.

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:37.110
We saw the machinery started dominating us.

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:41.830
We wanted to misidentify from that machinery.

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.390
Machinery has also given us lethargy

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:49.910
because we use machine made things our hands do not work.

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:53.030
We have lost all the deftness of the hands;

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:56.350
we have lost all the walking capacity.

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:01.270
We can only take a bus or a car; we do not want to walk at all.

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:06.630
Now this mechanization and the use of matter too much,

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:12.870
has made us sort of matters ourself.

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:16.830
We have become matter that we cannot live without it,

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:18.950
yet we are so identified with it.

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:23.670
After realization if you are still identified with the matter,

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:26.270
then your realization slows down.

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:31.430
So to, one has to understand, one has to understand fully

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:38.030
that matter is absolutely secondary.

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:43.350
Without of course getting your body you cannot receive realization,

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:45.390
you have to have your body.

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:48.590
But matter which is gross, is of no meaning.

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:52.830
Subtle matter is all right for us, that’s important.

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:55.950
Like this light, which is burning, is important.

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:59.950
Water that is in the ocean is all right.

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:04.150
The sky, open sky – say here it is not so good

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:07.030
but if you go to a country is even better.

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:10.910
The Mother Earth say example here, I don’t know how it is,

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:15.950
but in India certain places Mother Earth is very much subtle,

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:19.030
your material identifications.

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:24.630
So matter has been identified with us, we have been using it, living with it

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:29.950
and that’s why it is easy for us to get back into the same circle of matter.

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:33.295
And we get into it, we pay attention more to it.

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:40.130
Your attention if it is dominated by matter, people can make it out.

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:44.890
And that is one thing has to look after very clearly because

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:51.890
these are countries who have advanced so much in material advancement.

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:55.650
So what happens, every matter attracts your attention.

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:59.650
You go on the street there’s this one woman is standing

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:03.370
or there is something selling, this happening. All the time the attention …

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:06.410
You see it is their job to attract your attention,

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:08.810
otherwise how are they going to exploit you?

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:11.050
See, they will have no justification.

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:13.370
So they produce things, advertise things,

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:15.890
to do in such a way to distract your attention.

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:19.330
Now this is a force, which is acting against our attention.

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:25.610
So as far as possible keep your attention straight, or on the Mother Earth.

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:31.450
If you can control your attention, you can overcome your material domination.

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:35.810
Now the best thing is to put attention to your Spirit.

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:41.050
If you start putting your attention to Spirit,

00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:42.890
the sweetness of the Spirit itself

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:45.970
will make the whole thing very sweet and beautiful.

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:48.050
The attention should be in the Spirit.

00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:51.170
Even you are getting ready; keep the attention on the Spirit.

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:54.330
Now it’s not difficult because Kundalini has reached that stage.

00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:56.050
Before realization if I had said it,

00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:58.610
then you would have said, “Mother, how to do it?”

00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:04.890
But now when you have got realization, try to bring your attention to Spirit.

00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:10.050
Means first when the Kundalini rises you start looking at the Spirit

00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:14.210
or you say when you get realization you see the Spirit.

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:17.130
In the sense that the Spirit starts flowing through you,

00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:20.050
you start watching its flowing in this thing.

00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:24.930
But then after some time, you must enter into Spirit

00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:29.730
and see through the window of the Spirit, the whole thing

00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:36.570
by developing your witness Spirit. If you develop your witness state,

00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:43.730
from attention you become knowledge, the truth.

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:53.210
Then material things become the knowledge;

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:57.650
aesthetics of matter start giving you joy.

00:08:57.730 --> 00:09:01.530
You do not want to possess it, but they start giving you joy

00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:04.050
and even if you want to posses it,

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:09.050
it would be just to enjoy it and give it away to somebody else.

00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:11.650
It’s like that. It’s for your enjoyment

00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:14.970
and you want to give it away to someone else.

00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:21.810
When you develop your witness state this will come to you that you will

00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:28.650
not keep things to yourself but you would like to give and share, sharing.

00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:33.130
That is the time you should know you have become a witness,

00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:34.650
because you are enjoying.

00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:39.650
Witness state is the state of Shri Krishna, of Virat.

00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:46.530
When you start sharing your things then it is a proper thing.

00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:37.810
Now the essence of puja is also how to overcome our material grossness.

00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:45.810
Puja is nothing but is how to overcome our material grossness.

00:10:47.650 --> 00:10:51.370
When we want to have a matter to ourselves,

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:58.650
we must know that it is given to us by God. Everything belongs to God.

00:10:59.290 --> 00:11:00.970
Supposing we give flower to God,

00:11:01.090 --> 00:11:04.570
after all it is God’s own creation, what are we giving?

00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:09.330
We show light to God or do ‘aarti’ to God. What?

00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:12.970
It is all God’s light only, what do we do?

00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:19.930
But by showing light to God,

00:11:20.050 --> 00:11:24.610
what we do is to, we worship light within us.

00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:30.890
The light element gets enlightened within us.

00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:41.130
The light element is here on the Agnya.

00:11:41.650 --> 00:11:46.050
When you do aarti, or when you put light before God,

00:11:46.690 --> 00:11:49.090
when you show light to God,

00:11:50.290 --> 00:11:53.530
the light element within you gets enlightened.

00:11:54.050 --> 00:11:59.290
When you give flowers, Mooladhara gets enlightened.

00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:07.730
When you get honey, then your attention gets enlightened.

00:12:09.050 --> 00:12:13.650
So, why we give it to God, after all God doesn’t need anything.

00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:17.650
But God is the enjoyer. You are not the enjoyer, you cannot enjoy.

00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:23.650
Enjoyer is God in you. When God is there that enjoys, that is the Spirit.

00:12:27.090 --> 00:12:35.290
So whatever pleases your Spirit is used in the puja to be given.

00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:38.810
Now you give rice – all these things are discovered –

00:12:38.930 --> 00:12:43.650
that you give rice to the Devi. Rice should be put in Her lap.

00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:47.410
Now what is rice, a little rice to a Devi?

00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:53.850
Is, by putting rice, in you the satisfaction of getting food

00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:59.090
or food that gives you satisfaction is enlightened.

00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:08.290
But that doesn’t mean you start showering things on Me, that doesn’t mean that.

00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:11.810
What I am trying to say, do it with dignity and understanding.

00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:16.410
That you give Me rice. Now, rice giving

00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:21.090
– these people don’t understand why rice is to be given to God?

00:13:21.210 --> 00:13:25.650
After all, why give Him palm leaves? What is He going to do?

00:13:26.130 --> 00:13:33.530
If Christ was the Son of God. What was the use of putting palm leaves for Him?

00:13:35.650 --> 00:13:43.090
Or to give Him oil, oil bath or to rub His feet with oil?

00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:47.650
It is for you to get the advantage. Now in Sahaj yoga it is proved now.

00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:51.090
When you rub My feet, you feel better, not Me.

00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:54.650
You rub My hands, you feel better.

00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:58.050
When you fall at My feet, you feel better.

00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:01.410
She, she is a great – what was, what is, what were you doing?

00:14:01.530 --> 00:14:05.210
Lady: Reflexology
Shri Mataji: Reflexology. Big name, ah? Reflexology.

00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:08.410
And she is supposed to know about the feet and things like that

00:14:08.530 --> 00:14:12.930
One day she said, “Mother I want to come and massage Your feet.

00:14:13.090 --> 00:14:16.050
I know this and all that.” So I said, “All right, come along.”

00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:18.330
So she came to rub My feet.

00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:22.650
Instead of I feeling, becoming relaxed, she was becoming relaxed.

00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:25.650
The more she was rubbing she was getting relaxed.

00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:30.290
So you see when you do for God, the blessings comes to you.

00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:32.930
You are blessed.

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:39.730
Whatever is the problem with you, you give to God to solve.

00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:44.450
Also whatever satisfies you, you give to God.

00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:46.650
The satisfaction comes to you.

00:14:47.610 --> 00:14:51.970
Now, these flowers when you give it to Me, Mooladhara.

00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:55.290
They give you two things, Swadishthana and Mooladhara.

00:14:55.410 --> 00:14:57.650
Flowers that’s why are very important.

00:14:58.290 --> 00:15:00.970
They give Swadishthana, if the flowers are beautiful,

00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:02.570
then they give Swadishthana

00:15:02.650 --> 00:15:06.210
and if they are fragrant they cure your Mooladhara.

00:15:06.370 --> 00:15:11.690
Now, I mean there is no end to flowers also.

00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:18.330
But think about it, that you are doing it to improve your chakras.

00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:28.530
Then other things that are used like say ghee.

00:15:28.651 --> 00:15:31.611
Ghee is used. It is for Vishuddhi.

00:15:32.170 --> 00:15:35.610
Shri Krishna is very fond of ghee and butter.

00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:39.130
So when you rub My feet with say butter,

00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:42.330
your Vishuddhi will improve, you know that.

00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:44.330
Not Mine, I have no problem.

00:15:44.530 --> 00:15:46.690
I have only one problem that you are within Me

00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:48.930
and when you have problem I have problems.

00:15:49.050 --> 00:15:51.730
Because these vibrations have to go to you.

00:15:51.930 --> 00:15:56.810
So I prepare vibrations here as an antidote and they have to flow.

00:15:58.650 --> 00:16:01.930
It’s a very subtle thing to understand.

00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:08.210
To move from gross to Spirit, this is the thing by which you move,

00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:11.410
because first you enlighten your chakras.

00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:18.050
By enlightening your chakras, your deities get happy, prasanna.

00:16:18.290 --> 00:16:22.650
By making the deities happy, you keep, get a passage

00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:25.650
for the Kundalini to pass through.

00:16:26.050 --> 00:16:30.610
By making the passage for the Kundalini, the Kundalini goes up

00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:35.090
and then your attention starts becoming one with the Spirit.

00:16:35.650 --> 00:16:40.650
It is step by step, you move from matter to subtler matter,

00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:43.450
from subtler matter to your chakras,

00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:45.530
from chakras to deities,

00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:47.930
from deities to the Spirit.

00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:53.130
Then Spirit enjoys itself.

00:16:53.290 --> 00:16:55.530
So there you do not have to do anything.

00:16:55.650 --> 00:16:58.290
Just give your Spirit to Spirit.
