00:02.991 --> 00:07.101
Shri Adi Shakti Puja
Cabella Ligure (Italy), 25 May 1997

04:08.453 --> 04:18.178
Today we are going to do the puja
of Adi Shakti.

04:24.563 --> 04:31.355
It’s a difficult subject to talk about
Adi Shakti

04:32.996 --> 04:42.509
because it’s not easy to understand

04:43.142 --> 04:49.003
that Adi Shakti is the power of Sadashiva.

04:49.249 --> 04:55.251
Sadashiva is the God Almighty.

04:56.274 --> 05:00.426
She is His breath, as they some people
call it.

05:00.627 --> 05:05.026
Some say She is the desire

05:06.899 --> 05:16.825
and some say that She’s the entire power
of Sadashiva,

05:17.132 --> 05:26.772
and Sadashiva cannot do anything without
Her powers.

05:30.564 --> 05:39.377
This subject has been described by many
people in various books in different ways.

05:40.182 --> 05:46.457
But actually we need not go

05:46.658 --> 05:50.916
to the background of the creation
of Adi Shakti,

05:51.117 --> 05:57.946
for that at least you’ll need seven
lectures. But we’ll come to the point

05:58.147 --> 06:03.739
where Adi Shakti started working on this
Mother Earth.

06:05.353 --> 06:07.951
The first thing is we must know,

06:08.152 --> 06:13.899
that She created a Kundalini in the Mother
Earth itself

06:14.934 --> 06:23.835
and She created Shri Ganesha out of
the Mother Earth, it’s very interesting.

06:24.036 --> 06:29.559
So the Mother Earth becomes a very
important thing for us.

06:29.760 --> 06:34.120
If we do not know how to respect the Mother
Earth,

06:34.591 --> 06:40.306
we do not know how to respect ourselves.

06:40.687 --> 06:46.003
The expression of Adi Shakti within you
is the Kundalini, no doubt.

06:46.204 --> 06:51.062
That is the reflection of Adi Shakti
in you.

06:51.263 --> 06:57.434
But the reflection in the Mother Earth is
also expressed,

06:57.635 --> 07:06.849
as you all know, in different places,
different countries, different cities,

07:07.050 --> 07:16.070
as the manifestation of chakras and
Adi Shakti’s creations.

07:16.271 --> 07:25.000
It was very important first to create
a very holy Mother Earth

07:25.201 --> 07:29.353
for human beings to be born on that.

07:30.234 --> 07:41.148
So the reflection of the Adi Shakti as
Kundalini first was on the Mother Earth.

07:41.349 --> 07:49.734
Kundalini is a, we should say, is a wee
part of the Adi Shakti,

07:50.380 --> 07:59.073
or we can say that She is the desire,
pure desire of the Adi Shakti.

07:59.274 --> 08:05.392
So Adi Shakti is the desire, complete
desire of Sadashiva

08:05.593 --> 08:18.664
and Kundalini, Adi Kundalini, is the desire,
complete desire of Adi Shakti.

08:19.045 --> 08:23.324
Now this one was first expressed

08:24.898 --> 08:30.442
in the Mother Earth, inside the Mother
Earth.

08:31.878 --> 08:37.616
Inside the Mother Earth, the Kundalini
came up

08:38.540 --> 08:45.490
in such a way that it cooled down the inner
part of the Mother Earth

08:45.712 --> 08:49.115
as much as it could,

08:50.201 --> 09:02.451
and then it manifested on the surface
of the earth as different chakras.

09:04.161 --> 09:12.196
So it’s tremendous similarity that we have

09:13.442 --> 09:20.466
with Virata, the Mother Earth and the human
beings.

09:22.317 --> 09:34.189
If all of them are being reflected by
the Adi Kundalini,

09:34.390 --> 09:40.373
so there has to be a great connection
between them.

09:41.239 --> 09:50.981
It is not understood by human beings how
they are connected to this Mother Earth.

09:51.182 --> 09:56.446
This Kundalini passed through different
centers, creating different centers

09:56.647 --> 10:04.135
in the Mother Earth and ultimately broke
through Kailasha.

10:04.336 --> 10:07.994
And I don’t know how many have you been
to Kailash you’ll see

10:08.195 --> 10:14.191
tremendous vibrations flowing out
of Kailash.

10:15.014 --> 10:20.146
Now the way we insult our Mother Earth,

10:20.440 --> 10:28.115
what we are doing is we are insulting
the Adi Shakti.

10:28.433 --> 10:34.443
So many ways there are we should respect
the Mother Earth.

10:34.644 --> 10:42.594
I mean it was an Indian custom to begin
with, when you got up from your bed

10:42.795 --> 10:46.675
and you touched the Mother Earth with
your feet,

10:46.876 --> 10:51.700
you have to say, “Oh Mother Earth, please
forgive me

10:51.901 --> 10:56.406
because I’m touching you with my feet”.

10:58.541 --> 11:07.552
All the movements of Mother Earth are
controlled by this inner Kundalini,

11:07.753 --> 11:11.593
which is the reflection of Adi Shakti.

11:11.794 --> 11:17.671
The gravity that it has also is
the manifestation

11:17.872 --> 11:23.602
of the Kundalini of the Mother Earth.

11:23.803 --> 11:33.186
Now, why we are suffering in this beautiful
planet,

11:33.387 --> 11:39.835
because we do not respect what we have
to respect the most.

11:40.036 --> 11:45.226
Mother Earth is to be respected, meaning
what?

11:45.427 --> 11:54.442
Meaning that whatever is created on this
earth, by the movement of the earth,

11:54.643 --> 12:01.801
by the sea, by all the elements, has to be
respected.

12:02.170 --> 12:10.724
Today’s problem is pollution, all kinds
of things people talk of.

12:10.925 --> 12:15.879
The reason behind it, people never
understood the importance

12:16.080 --> 12:23.772
of all these five elements which are
supportive of our life.

12:23.973 --> 12:28.815
So to respect the Mother Earth people do
Bhumi Puja.

12:29.016 --> 12:32.342
Many people, when they are building
a house,

12:32.543 --> 12:37.338
they will do the Bhumi Pujan, means they
will respect the Mother Earth,

12:37.539 --> 12:43.565
because if She is not being respected maybe
there could be an earthquake,

12:43.766 --> 12:53.882
which means that this Mother Earth
understands, knows and acts.

12:55.406 --> 13:02.800
It acts in such a manner that human beings
don’t understand why such things happen.

13:03.001 --> 13:09.483
Now, we can say that, in a place called
Latur,

13:10.007 --> 13:20.655
it was Shri Ganesha’s fourteenth day and
they had to submerge

13:21.400 --> 13:30.700
the statues into the sea or into the river,
so they went all out, singing, dancing.

13:30.901 --> 13:36.039
After coming from there they all started
drinking,

13:36.398 --> 13:43.641
and drinking is not liked by Mother Earth
at all.

13:43.842 --> 13:49.498
If you are drunk and you are walking
on the road you’ll fall down.

13:50.069 --> 14:00.011
It so happened with their drinking that
a big earthquake broke in,

14:00.212 --> 14:05.081
and all those who were dancing, were
drinking, all of them

14:05.282 --> 14:10.548
were engulfed into that earthquake by
Mother Earth.

14:10.749 --> 14:18.543
Only our center, which is there, was
surrounded by a big gap

14:18.744 --> 14:27.903
but nothing happened to our center and not
one single Sahaja Yogi was ruined by that.

14:28.104 --> 14:33.999
We can understand because we are Sahaja
Yogis, how the Mother Earth has acted

14:34.200 --> 14:38.776
to save those people, who were Sahaja
Yogis.

14:38.977 --> 14:45.882
So the understanding of Mother Earth about
saints is very great.

14:46.083 --> 14:54.609
She knows who is a saint, She knows
the feet of a saint

14:54.810 --> 15:00.963
and that’s why, you know so many things
were created, like Moses,

15:01.164 --> 15:07.207
He went to the sea and the Mother Earth
came up, for them to walk through.

15:07.408 --> 15:14.775
If all the Jews had walked, it would not
have worked, but it was Moses

15:14.976 --> 15:21.769
and His saintliness that the Mother Earth
Herself came up and helped.

15:21.970 --> 15:32.489
In the same way when Rama was building
a big bridge between Lanka and India,

15:32.690 --> 15:36.864
the Mother Earth came up as a bridge.

15:37.157 --> 15:44.787
So we should not try to curse the Mother
Earth for any mishaps on this Earth.

15:45.001 --> 15:50.824
If people are saintly they will be always
protected by Mother Earth.

15:51.025 --> 15:56.722
She will always try to give them whatever
they want.

15:56.923 --> 16:03.560
You can see in the minute way, that
supposing now, in our Cabella here,

16:03.761 --> 16:09.309
the roses are of such a big size, such
a big size roses,

16:09.518 --> 16:16.044
you won’t find such big size in the whole
world. But we have here, such big ones.

16:16.245 --> 16:21.120
In Pratisthan we had

16:22.521 --> 16:28.443
flowers of sunflower so big as that.
One man could not lift it.

16:28.644 --> 16:33.990
Now, how is it all this is happening
in particular places?

16:34.191 --> 16:39.435
Is the Mother Earth who knows who is living
here,

16:39.636 --> 16:48.828
who is walking on Her back we should say,
or on Her soil,

16:49.029 --> 16:53.819
because Mother Earth understands
vibrations.

16:54.020 --> 17:01.378
Now, certain places we say that are very
holy.

17:07.834 --> 17:14.850
How have they discovered that these places
are holy, because of magnetic forces.

17:15.051 --> 17:20.057
The magnetic forces in England I was
surprised, were crossing each other

17:20.258 --> 17:23.188
at a place called Oxted where we lived.

17:23.389 --> 17:27.982
They were crossing since long, but we lived
there later on.

17:28.183 --> 17:37.369
So Mother Earth also organizes and arranges
things for saintly people.

17:37.570 --> 17:44.179
It's very interesting to see how the Mother
Earth guides you in a proper way.

17:44.380 --> 17:47.330
I mean, I don't know how many instances
I can give you.

17:47.531 --> 17:53.056
But we don’t understand the value of
the understanding of this Mother Earth

17:53.257 --> 17:59.330
and Her loving protection for all
he saints.

17:59.551 --> 18:06.378
In the same way, we have to understand how
the whole atmosphere, the rain,

18:06.579 --> 18:10.620
comes in at the right time, the moon,
the sun,

18:10.821 --> 18:17.694
everything works out in such a beautiful
manner because they know it’s a saint.

18:17.895 --> 18:25.018
They know these are saintly people sitting
here. They know that they are pure people,

18:25.219 --> 18:31.827
that they are the essence of life and they
should be looked after,

18:32.028 --> 18:36.276
they should be cared for, they should be
bothered for.

18:36.477 --> 18:42.720
It is not bothered about people who are
of no use.

18:42.921 --> 18:49.418
For example now for Haj, so many people
went and so many were killed.

18:49.619 --> 18:54.476
Some went to Amarnath and they were killed
because they were not saints,

18:54.677 --> 19:00.254
just ritualistic people, going for a ritual
which,

19:00.455 --> 19:09.636
in the discretion of the Mother Earth, was
of no avail and of no advantage to them.

19:09.837 --> 19:13.175
But nobody learns from this, nobody learns.

19:13.295 --> 19:17.362
When so many people were going to say,
Amarnath were killed,

19:17.563 --> 19:21.903
Pakistan said, “See, they should not have
gone to this Amarnath,

19:22.104 --> 19:28.172
it’s a false place, why did they go there?
And by going there

19:28.373 --> 19:32.817
what has proved is that it’s not a holy
place”.

19:33.018 --> 19:36.763
But when the Haj thing took place, they had
nothing to say,

19:36.964 --> 19:40.014
they didn’t know how to explain this
Haj business

19:40.215 --> 19:44.988
and the killing – dying of so many people.

19:45.189 --> 19:52.713
The reason is this, that these people have
been going to Haj all the time.

19:52.914 --> 19:56.736
Once there was a stampede with thirty-two
thousand people being

19:56.937 --> 20:01.394
injured and troubled and killed. Now this
is it.

20:01.595 --> 20:09.705
Now, what is Mother Earth suggesting, that
going to these places,

20:09.911 --> 20:16.581
holy places, they are really holy, no doubt;
going to these places,

20:16.782 --> 20:20.947
you are not doing any spiritual ascent.

20:21.148 --> 20:28.374
You are not achieving anything by going
to these places, which are really holy.

20:28.575 --> 20:32.433
That cannot be challenged. They are holy
places.

20:32.634 --> 20:37.486
You must be knowing that I was born
in Chindwara, and Mecca and Chindwara

20:37.687 --> 20:43.128
are on the same Cancer line. How is it?

20:43.329 --> 20:50.298
What is about Mecca? Mecca is
Macceshwarshiv – it’s a Shiva.

20:50.499 --> 20:57.079
Why did Mohammed Sahib ask people
to worship a stone?

20:57.280 --> 21:02.028
He didn’t believe in stones, He was against
all kinds of idol worship;

21:02.229 --> 21:07.041
then why did He say this black stone,
which is there, has to be worshipped,

21:07.242 --> 21:10.858
for that people have to go there. What was
the reason?

21:11.059 --> 21:16.200
Because He could feel the vibrations, He
could feel that it’s a swayambhu,

21:16.401 --> 21:20.253
so He said it. So all the Muslims like mad
are going there.

21:20.454 --> 21:26.896
By going there nobody has improved, I have
not seen anybody improved by going to Mecca.

21:27.097 --> 21:31.272
It's just a kind of a ritual. They think
if they go there,

21:31.473 --> 21:35.462
when they will die tomorrow they will tell
God, “See now, we have a certificate,

21:35.663 --> 21:38.592
we have been to Mecca.”

21:40.595 --> 21:46.425
Like our pope once upon a time used to give
certificate, that when you go to heaven,

21:46.626 --> 21:52.659
you can show the certificate that now you
are a real Christian.

21:52.860 --> 21:59.812
In this way, all these artificial things
came up, but there is reality behind it.

22:00.013 --> 22:06.384
The difference is the reality is for
the real people and not for false people.

22:06.585 --> 22:09.720
But this ritualism has grown too much.

22:09.921 --> 22:16.931
Like in India we have many swayambhus
created by the Kundalini again I would say,

22:17.132 --> 22:20.329
and which are really worshipped.

22:20.530 --> 22:27.250
I’ve been to most of them and I was
surprised that most of the pujaris

22:27.451 --> 22:32.520
were suffering from some sort of a serious
disease. Like one was a paralyzed fellow.

22:32.721 --> 22:36.945
He said, “We are serving this God here,
and You said this is swayambhu;

22:37.146 --> 22:40.669
then Mother, how, why is it we are
suffering from this disease?”

22:40.870 --> 22:45.665
I said, “Because you are just making money.
You can’t make money out of God.

22:45.866 --> 22:50.257
If you don’t want to serve God, you don’t
stay here, but if you want to serve God,

22:50.458 --> 22:55.446
then you can stay here, but don’t make
money out of this”.

22:55.647 --> 23:02.726
It’s very common, I have seen, those people
who make money get paralysis, I’ve seen it.

23:04.791 --> 23:12.486
It’s a very deep understanding all these
elements, Mother Earth,

23:12.687 --> 23:17.438
everybody has about everything.

23:18.509 --> 23:23.645
Because their Kundalini is not like your
Kundalini,

23:23.846 --> 23:34.003
which is, though in itself is pure, but
because of your human endeavors,

23:34.204 --> 23:39.652
human mistakes, ego, superego, all sorts
of nonsense,

23:39.853 --> 23:48.334
the Kundalini is not so sensitive, nor does
it tell you what is happening.

23:48.535 --> 23:57.781
It has to be very alert, sensitive
spirituality within you,

23:57.982 --> 24:05.035
by which you can say immediately what you
think,

24:05.236 --> 24:10.019
what you know, what you understand about
anything.

24:10.220 --> 24:15.873
But the problem is that this doesn’t exist.

24:16.160 --> 24:21.106
Why is it you should not be so sensitive?

24:21.315 --> 24:25.779
On the contrary, I have seen, if their
mind works against somebody,

24:25.980 --> 24:28.617
then they start saying, “You are catching
on this, you are catching on that,

24:28.737 --> 24:34.236
you are catching on that”. Actually
the person who’s saying that is catching.

24:34.938 --> 24:40.416
So with this thing one has to understand
that if we are the true reflection

24:40.617 --> 24:51.928
of Adi Shakti, then we should be pure,
absolutely pure, like the white snow.

24:52.129 --> 24:57.123
Even one black drop – that’s why I wore
today the white sari -

24:57.324 --> 25:01.142
falls on the white, it shows.

25:01.405 --> 25:11.856
You should be so white that anything,
any minute black spot

25:12.057 --> 25:21.706
also should be seen by you, and in others
also to be felt by you.

25:22.333 --> 25:36.814
If that height is achieved by pure life,
by pure thinking, by pure heart,

25:37.015 --> 25:42.930
it is not necessary to manipulate anything;
no, no need at all.

25:43.131 --> 25:50.220
It’s all natural like the Mother Earth is.
Does She manipulate anything? Nothing.

25:50.421 --> 25:55.438
Just see how spontaneous She is. You put
a seed in the Mother Earth

25:55.639 --> 25:59.550
and see how it sprouts.

25:59.751 --> 26:05.574
She is so spontaneous, Her activity is so
spontaneous, we never wonder about it.

26:05.775 --> 26:09.818
See different types of flowers, different
types of fragrance,

26:10.019 --> 26:14.161
different types of shrubs and trees,

26:14.362 --> 26:19.648
how She grows with such balance in every
place.

26:19.849 --> 26:29.182
In every minute atom and molecule of that
Mother Earth there is sense.

26:31.162 --> 26:38.992
So before us is the best reflection of the
Adi Shakti and that is this Mother Earth.

26:39.193 --> 26:42.373
So first we must respect the Mother Earth.

26:42.574 --> 26:46.218
I like you people because you are sitting
on the ground, it’s very good.

26:46.419 --> 26:51.162
For meditation if you can sit on the Mother
Earth it will be extremely good

26:51.363 --> 26:56.407
because the special quality of the Mother
Earth, which also I have unfortunately,

26:56.608 --> 27:03.716
that I suck your problems. She too sucks
your problem

27:03.917 --> 27:09.450
and when She sucks your problem you get
rid of them without any difficulties.

27:09.651 --> 27:16.812
So, if you cannot, say, sit on the ground,
then you take a stone, better is,

27:17.013 --> 27:23.239
or you can have a marble, or something which
is natural on which you should try to sit.

27:23.440 --> 27:27.680
But if you sit on the plastic and do your
meditation, I don’t know

27:27.881 --> 27:31.562
what is going to help you – the plastic?

27:31.798 --> 27:36.326
That’s why I request you always, that use
natural things,

27:36.527 --> 27:43.713
because natural things can absorb your
problems very well.

27:44.006 --> 27:47.461
Unnaturally also we live otherwise.

27:47.662 --> 27:51.493
You see it is on the physical line, also
on mental line.

27:51.694 --> 28:00.785
On mental line what do we do, that we go on
arguing, explaining,

28:00.986 --> 28:05.926
it’s going on and on and on and on! There’s
no end to it.

28:06.127 --> 28:11.503
One should get headache, you see, actually
with all that. But if you are spontaneous,

28:11.704 --> 28:15.845
if you are very spontaneous, immediately
you will know

28:16.046 --> 28:21.480
what the other fellow is trying to do or
to say or to communicate.

28:21.681 --> 28:23.970
You don’t need much thinking about it,

28:24.171 --> 28:28.643
because you can absorb even the thought
of another person.

28:28.844 --> 28:33.689
Absorb doesn’t mean that you take the bad
thing of that person,

28:33.890 --> 28:40.049
but it’s like the sieving out. You absorb
what another person is saying

28:40.250 --> 28:43.116
and you sieve it out.

28:44.948 --> 28:51.315
Now the problem of this Adi Shakti is this,
that I decided

28:51.516 --> 28:59.204
that I will have all of you enter into
My body, absorb all of you.

28:59.409 --> 29:03.491
It’s a very dangerous game I know, but
I did play,

29:03.692 --> 29:08.348
because I’m supposed to do at this stage
of time,

29:08.549 --> 29:12.294
that I should absorb you all in My body.

29:12.495 --> 29:16.531
So with you, all your problems are also
gone into Me,

29:16.732 --> 29:19.714
all your troubles also have gone into Me.

29:19.915 --> 29:24.253
But by absorbing it, see, it’s like ocean
into which you are put

29:24.454 --> 29:33.617
and you are cleansed. But what about
the ocean?

29:34.014 --> 29:40.753
Ocean has got still your problems and things
lingering and they are very troublesome.

29:40.954 --> 29:46.433
So the best thing would be for you
to cleanse yourself.

29:46.679 --> 29:51.819
Cleansing is very important through
introspection.

29:52.020 --> 29:55.285
But doesn’t mean thinking, never means
thinking.

29:55.486 --> 30:00.960
But introspection means meditation and that
you all should meditate.

30:01.161 --> 30:05.691
I must tell you, we had a meeting
of the leaders

30:05.892 --> 30:09.554
and they came out and sat in the drawing
room.

30:09.755 --> 30:14.262
As soon as they assembled I had such
a severe pain in the stomach

30:14.463 --> 30:20.178
and I had such a bad diarrhea that you
can’t believe.

30:20.379 --> 30:25.007
Now, who has got those problems, I don’t
know.

30:29.527 --> 30:32.563
Who has brought these problems, I don’t
know.

30:32.764 --> 30:39.629
But as a Mother, as a Mother, I don’t mind
anything,

30:39.830 --> 30:43.866
as long as you all get well and purified.

30:44.067 --> 30:48.851
Just like as the Mother Earth cares for you,
I also care for you.

30:49.052 --> 30:53.212
And just like as the Mother Earth loves you,
I also love you,

30:53.413 --> 30:56.632
whether you are bad or good is not
the point.

30:56.833 --> 31:03.750
But to be kind to Me if you could try to be
really good Sahaja Yogis,

31:03.951 --> 31:09.454
not a showoffs, not business-like, not only
thinking type,

31:09.655 --> 31:13.336
not argumentative, not criticizing others;

31:13.537 --> 31:18.325
if you just try to meditate every day ten
to fifteen minutes,

31:18.526 --> 31:24.297
I tell you, My health will be first class.
Because I have taken your injections inside

31:24.498 --> 31:28.809
and they start torturing My life for nothing
at all.

31:29.010 --> 31:34.698
See so, now, it’s a risk I have run, and
I am sure you are all very sensible people,

31:34.899 --> 31:39.093
and you will understand that your Mother
shouldn’t suffer.

31:39.294 --> 31:42.434
This is every-day crucifixion for Me
sometimes you know,

31:42.635 --> 31:48.306
and I don’t know what to say. For example,
the other day in Delhi,

31:48.507 --> 31:52.205
one gentleman who is a leader, came to Me,
to see Me,

31:52.406 --> 31:56.706
and My one foot started going like that
and paining so much.

31:56.873 --> 31:59.783
I mean I didn’t know what to tell him that,
“You get out now,”

31:59.984 --> 32:02.175
because I just can’t hurt him, you know.

32:02.295 --> 32:06.255
But I said, “What’s the matter, where have
you been, what did you do?”

32:06.456 --> 32:11.735
And so he realized and he went out, and
really it improved.

32:11.936 --> 32:17.803
Nearness also, I think, has an effect,
because if a man like that is,

32:18.004 --> 32:23.021
or a lady like that is full of problems and
she comes

32:23.237 --> 32:31.248
very much closer to My attention, then I
have to take up the cross, it’s like this.

32:31.449 --> 32:37.511
A very simple understanding should be that,
“Why are we in Sahaja Yoga?”.

32:37.717 --> 32:44.981
We are in Sahaja Yoga to ascend, to go
higher and higher, as you sang yesterday.

32:45.182 --> 32:50.996
It was very entertaining yesterday the way
you talked about your

32:51.197 --> 32:58.993
ambition to be higher and higher. Really
it was very joy-giving, no doubt.

32:59.194 --> 33:05.275
But what are we doing about it, what are
we trying about it, we should see.

33:05.476 --> 33:09.601
Seriously we must think, are we meditating,

33:09.802 --> 33:15.044
are we all doing something to elevate
others also,

33:15.245 --> 33:19.082
to give realizations to others? Specially
women I have seen,

33:19.283 --> 33:24.112
don’t do much of this, which is very bad,
because you are the mothers.

33:24.313 --> 33:28.531
You have to go all out to give realizations
to others.

33:28.732 --> 33:34.393
But men are more active that way and women
are not. So it works the other way round.

33:34.594 --> 33:40.508
Now on one side the men are, I think are
active but don’t meditate.

33:40.709 --> 33:46.035
Women meditate and men do the outside work,
it’s sort of a part-time,

33:46.236 --> 33:54.200
or you can call it a good labor division
that, “You meditate at home

33:54.401 --> 33:57.604
and we’ll go all out”. It’s not going
to work out.

33:57.805 --> 34:04.818
So one has to meditate and one has to also
go out

34:05.019 --> 34:10.313
to spread Sahaja Yoga.  Both things have
to be done.

34:10.514 --> 34:16.891
Supposing now you meditate and you don’t
spread Sahaja Yoga, you will never ascend.

34:17.092 --> 34:22.775
Because after all this Kundalini, you see,
She’s a sensible woman, na,

34:22.976 --> 34:29.936
She’s very sensible. She thinks, “Why
should I make her a saint?

34:30.137 --> 34:35.447
What is the use?”. Sahaja Yoga is not
individualistic,

34:35.648 --> 34:41.877
it’s not for one person to become a saint
and sit somewhere, it’s not like that.

34:42.405 --> 34:46.436
It’s not meant for one person, for oneself,

34:46.637 --> 34:50.946
it’s not individualistic. It’s a collective
happening.

34:51.147 --> 34:54.213
So if you are not helping to
the collective,

34:54.414 --> 34:58.923
Kundalini says, “All right, you are
all right as it is”, just like our body.

34:59.124 --> 35:03.375
See, in our body if one organ says,
“All right, now I am all right,

35:03.576 --> 35:08.280
I am not going to work out”, or one cell
says that, “I am not going to now grow,

35:08.400 --> 35:12.342
it’s all right. Why should I worry about
the whole body?”, it won’t work.

35:12.543 --> 35:17.056
It’s a living, it’s a living organism,
I have told you hundred times,

35:17.257 --> 35:25.553
when it is a living organism it has to grow,
it has to grow and also to absorb.

35:25.754 --> 35:29.530
To have energy you have to meditate and
you have to grow.

35:29.731 --> 35:34.071
If you don’t grow, you are finished. You
are no more a Sahaja Yogi.

35:34.272 --> 35:41.199
I wouldn’t call a person a Sahaja Yogi who
has not even given one person realization.

35:41.679 --> 35:46.978
Cannot be a Sahaja Yogi, Sahaja Yogi has
to give realizations to others.

35:47.179 --> 35:51.009
Apart from other activities, the main
activity should be

35:51.210 --> 35:54.199
how we give realizations to others.

35:54.400 --> 35:59.832
Unless and until we really look after that
side of life

36:00.033 --> 36:04.440
we can never, never grow in Sahaja Yoga.

36:05.018 --> 36:12.777
For example now, take My position. I’m
all right, I’m complete, I have no problem.

36:12.995 --> 36:21.418
But why did I work so hard and wanted
so many Sahaja Yogis, why?

36:21.619 --> 36:25.611
What was the - I don’t have to grow either,
I’m overgrown already.

36:25.812 --> 36:29.176
I don’t have to do it, but why? What is
the need?

36:29.377 --> 36:33.452
The need is like this, the need is of love.

36:33.653 --> 36:37.753
I have so much love that I have
to channelize it.

36:37.954 --> 36:42.830
If I don’t I’ll suffocate, I can’t love
Myself.

36:43.038 --> 36:47.893
So this love has to spread. For that I have
to have you people,

36:48.094 --> 36:52.192
who can take this love to others and make
them happy.

36:52.393 --> 36:57.515
This is a kind of a vision I have,

36:57.716 --> 37:05.108
and in this special time, it was promised
by many people, by many saints,

37:05.309 --> 37:12.064
and it is so obvious that you are all
specially chosen for this kind of thing.

37:12.265 --> 37:17.965
Now how far you understand your importance
is a different point.

37:22.440 --> 37:29.323
You do for your emancipation, all right,
you meditate.

37:29.524 --> 37:36.526
But if you are not channelizing the love,
the Divine love, what is the use?

37:36.727 --> 37:40.394
Now supposing I repair something very
nicely:

37:40.595 --> 37:45.495
I repair this machine nicely, put it right,
everything, and I don’t speak,

37:45.696 --> 37:48.973
what’s the use of having this?

37:49.505 --> 37:54.227
In the same way, if you work very hard,
I know people who get up at four o’clock,

37:54.428 --> 37:57.470
have their baths, do meditation,

37:57.671 --> 38:02.192
sit down, in the night again they sit down
for meditation.

38:02.393 --> 38:08.487
But they never go out, they never talk
to others, they never spread Sahaja Yoga.

38:08.688 --> 38:16.087
They do not give Divine love to others, so
how can this great problem of this world

38:16.288 --> 38:22.337
be solved, that it has no love? It has
never known Divine love.

38:22.518 --> 38:28.471
It has to be given to them.

38:28.672 --> 38:37.999
They have to feel this Divine love, this
power of Adi Shakti.

38:38.200 --> 38:43.261
They have to know it. Otherwise you have
been selfish, I would say,

38:43.462 --> 38:49.857
that you had a nice time having all this
and you have not given it to others.

38:50.095 --> 38:54.491
This is the reason why Sahaja Yoga
sometimes fails

38:54.692 --> 39:00.128
to create a proper balanced personality
in a human being.

39:00.329 --> 39:04.403
Some people are like this, that now
supposing

39:04.604 --> 39:09.220
a Sahaja Yogi has married another Sahaja
Yogi, take a position like that.

39:09.421 --> 39:14.794
Now My desire is that they should develop
a complete understanding of each other,

39:14.995 --> 39:22.328
love for each other, but love for Sahaja
Yoga and for others.

39:22.529 --> 39:30.358
This is the only way we can justify
marriage in Sahaja Yoga,

39:30.559 --> 39:36.466
otherwise why should they marry? But
doesn’t happen like that.

39:36.667 --> 39:43.043
What happens is once they are married then
either they will quarrel,

39:43.244 --> 39:47.927
they will ask for divorce; if that doesn’t
happen luckily,

39:48.128 --> 39:51.497
because in Sahaja Yoga so easy to get
married, you know.

39:51.698 --> 39:57.758
If that doesn’t happen, then they start
having their own family,

39:57.959 --> 40:06.301
their own homes, they are again becoming
very small, very, very small, very limited.

40:06.502 --> 40:10.453
Did you come to Sahaja Yoga for that?

40:11.863 --> 40:14.390
You have to realize your responsibility.

40:14.510 --> 40:19.399
See this Mother Earth, how She knows
Her responsibility.

40:19.600 --> 40:26.140
She’s just made out of nothing but soil,
some mud, but look at Her.

40:26.341 --> 40:31.183
How She is conscious, how She is
particular, how She works it out,

40:31.384 --> 40:34.416
how She is attentive, how She is careful.

40:34.617 --> 40:39.982
While you, though you have been blessed
so much by everything

40:40.183 --> 40:45.054
you are, are you thinking of giving it
to others?

40:45.255 --> 40:51.611
With twelve disciples, whatever was
the problem of Christianity, I mean

40:51.812 --> 40:59.807
it was nothing good job, I must say, but
still Christianity spread out.

41:00.380 --> 41:04.465
Islam was not a very good job either,
it spread out.

41:04.666 --> 41:11.607
All those bad jobs have spread out so much,
so why not the good job of Sahaja Yoga?

41:11.808 --> 41:16.021
It has to spread, it has to go to various
places.

41:16.222 --> 41:20.390
Try and find out where you can go and talk
about it

41:20.591 --> 41:25.522
and do something good to others and help
them somehow

41:25.723 --> 41:35.993
to rise above this common existence
of misery, unhappiness and destruction.

41:36.224 --> 41:41.348
The time is very short and I think if you
see the time,

41:41.549 --> 41:46.192
the rate at which we are moving is not
proper.

41:46.393 --> 41:49.849
We have to be much faster, we have to go
much ahead

41:50.050 --> 41:55.447
and we have to create much more Sahaja
Yogis

41:55.648 --> 42:03.891
through our consistent, very intensive
effort.

42:04.092 --> 42:10.133
But we - it’s a side issue, you see, it’s
by the way, Sahaja Yoga is by the way.

42:10.334 --> 42:14.267
And this is where we are failing in our
responsibility.

42:14.451 --> 42:16.963
We have to learn from the Mother Earth.

42:17.164 --> 42:22.412
You might say that, “Mataji, how can we be
like you? After all You are Adi Shakti”.

42:22.613 --> 42:25.628
Many people say that. “You are Adi Shakti,
so what,

42:25.829 --> 42:28.904
you see, with one finger You can move
things like that”.

42:29.105 --> 42:35.057
But why should I? Why should I, what
is the need?

42:35.476 --> 42:40.685
So in that reflection that you are Me,

42:40.886 --> 42:45.700
in that reflection that the Mother Earth
is Me,

42:45.901 --> 42:50.647
in that beautiful creation within you,

42:50.848 --> 42:58.956
you have to become very sensitive
to the need of the world.

42:59.238 --> 43:03.644
What is the need of the world? Today,
if you fail,

43:03.845 --> 43:09.047
the whole thing will fail forever. Only
very few will be there.

43:09.248 --> 43:16.307
So the need for you is to spread Sahaja
Yoga, because this love

43:16.508 --> 43:21.992
is not only for you. Is not to be enjoyed
by you,

43:22.182 --> 43:29.945
but is to be enjoyed by as many possible
in the whole world.

43:30.146 --> 43:36.216
So today we have to decide that, as
the children of Adi Shakti,

43:36.417 --> 43:41.752
we have to go all out, everywhere, every
corner,

43:41.953 --> 43:51.394
we have to shout and we have to tell loudly
what is the time in which we are living,

43:51.595 --> 44:03.587
and what is the responsibility that you
have to fulfill as Sahaja Yogis.

44:03.788 --> 44:07.797
There must be some reason why you are here.

44:07.998 --> 44:13.850
Like in the beginning, Sahaja Yogis used
to ask Me, “Mother, was I this last life,

44:14.051 --> 44:18.874
was I Shivaji last life?” I said, “What’s
the use?

44:19.075 --> 44:22.288
You might have been anything, but what are
you today is much higher”.

44:22.489 --> 44:27.301
Try to understand. You might be, say,
Napoleon,

44:27.502 --> 44:34.393
you might be, say, one of the kings say,
or maybe the queen from somewhere.

44:34.594 --> 44:40.265
So what, what did they do? Did they raise
anybody’s Kundalini?

44:40.466 --> 44:44.988
Did they have any power? Even the disciples
of Christ

44:45.189 --> 44:50.651
or even Mohammed Sahib’s disciples, anyone
- did they do it?

44:50.852 --> 44:55.699
Did they have any understanding
of Kundalini?

44:55.900 --> 45:03.787
Did they have any love for others, that
they should give them realization?

45:03.988 --> 45:07.775
There were some Sufis, they never gave
realization to anyone.

45:07.976 --> 45:11.427
There were so many saints who never gave
realization to anybody.

45:11.628 --> 45:14.419
Mohammed Sahib never gave realization
to anybody.

45:14.620 --> 45:18.748
Gautam Buddha never gave realization
to anybody, think of it.

45:18.949 --> 45:22.759
Christ never gave realization to anybody.
Anybody.

45:22.960 --> 45:29.327
Krishna did not do it, Rama did not. Nobody
- but you can do it!

45:30.971 --> 45:36.298
You can do it and you know everything about
Kundalini.

45:36.499 --> 45:42.928
It’s a very big thing because you are
children of the Adi Shakti.

45:43.129 --> 45:47.371
You are here and your Mother is here.

45:47.572 --> 45:54.511
It’s a very, very fortunate thing for Me
that you are here.

45:54.712 --> 46:00.423
I’m very proud of you, but again and again
I have to tell you that

46:00.624 --> 46:06.890
the work has to be with a faster speed,
we have to move with a faster speed

46:07.091 --> 46:10.172
and get more people to Sahaja Yoga.

46:10.373 --> 46:17.125
It is rather, rather difficult for Me to say
something forcefully,

46:17.326 --> 46:22.855
that’s not My nature you know. Can’t get
into tempers and cannot get angry,

46:23.056 --> 46:30.166
and I cannot forcefully say something
to you, but if you fail,

46:30.367 --> 46:35.899
then only thing will be that you have
failed Me completely.

46:36.109 --> 46:41.404
It means that, nothing less than that, and
if you don’t want to do it,

46:41.605 --> 46:47.000
then I would request all of you to take a
vow today that you will spread Sahaja Yoga

46:47.201 --> 46:50.599
and you will talk about Sahaja Yoga, know
about Sahaj Yog.

46:50.800 --> 46:53.371
There are many who don’t know anything.

46:53.572 --> 46:57.272
Also it’s very surprising they are Sahaja
Yogis, they don’t know anything.

46:57.473 --> 47:01.243
And don’t create problems for Me, like
marriage:

47:01.444 --> 47:04.482
“We can’t now live now with the wife,
we can’t live with the husband”.

47:04.683 --> 47:10.233
All sorts of nonsensical problems people
create for Me in Sahaja Yoga.

47:10.434 --> 47:15.216
Are you here to create problems, or
to remove problems of people?

47:15.417 --> 47:20.873
So on the whole we have done well I must
say, but it’s not the final.

47:21.074 --> 47:27.099
We have to work faster with more enthusiasm
and joyfully.

47:27.300 --> 47:31.309
You don’t know what joy you get when you
give realization to somebody.

47:31.510 --> 47:37.360
It’s the most joyful moment is when you
give realizations to others.

47:37.561 --> 47:41.495
Just try, you must try once, you’ll
enjoy it,

47:41.696 --> 47:45.898
then you’ll want more and more and more.
Now after Sahaja Yoga really

47:46.099 --> 47:51.964
the want disappears into this desire that,
“My God, this man is going,

47:52.165 --> 47:54.098
should I call him and give him
realization?”

47:54.299 --> 47:56.626
On the street you will feel like calling
him, “Come here, come here,

47:56.827 --> 48:01.805
I want to give you something”, then make
him sit down, give realization.

48:02.006 --> 48:06.584
This will be your style, like mad - you’ll
say, “Oh no, no, look at this,

48:06.785 --> 48:11.662
this gentleman is without any realization,
let us give him”.

48:11.863 --> 48:14.444
You’ll have to go to churches, you’ll have
to go to universities,

48:14.564 --> 48:16.849
you have to go to all such congregations

48:17.050 --> 48:20.180
where they have no idea about what they
can achieve;

48:20.381 --> 48:24.461
and then tell them without any fear,
without any malice.

48:24.662 --> 48:27.081
You can talk to them and you should tell
them,

48:27.282 --> 48:29.717
“Now we are here to help you, for your
good.

48:29.918 --> 48:33.537
We have not come for our good but for your
good, now listen to us”.

48:33.738 --> 48:39.826
And I am sure, very sure, that the Kundalini
within you will be very happy.

48:40.027 --> 48:45.256
She is not happy you see, She is not happy
with people who are not using her fully.

48:45.457 --> 48:50.185
So She will be very happy to help you and
to do the needful

48:50.386 --> 48:53.584
for the emancipation of the whole world.

48:53.719 --> 48:56.599
May God bless you.
