down taking vibrations.... in a way or
just try to help them now is to put them..

00:02:32.361 --> 00:02:37.818
His boy has got polio, so you rub him
on the left hand side - the sciatica nerve

00:02:37.818 --> 00:02:42.461
is completely full. You ask Warren
he'll tell you all about it.

00:02:42.461 --> 00:02:47.342
They'll help you with your polio and
even Dhumaal, if he's here.
SYogi: Yes, Mother

00:02:47.342 --> 00:02:53.436
Warren, this boy is suffering from polio.
Just try to help him out with this.

00:02:53.436 --> 00:02:58.215
You can take him in the room and let him
lie down on the bed and just rub it out.

00:02:58.215 --> 00:03:01.164
Warren: Kerosene treatment
Shri Mataji: Now.. [IN HINDI - Yes]

00:03:01.164 --> 00:03:04.107

Shri Mataji: [MARATHI] 
[IN HINDI - Sit comfortably putting
your legs in front]

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:09.381
Shri Mataji: [IN HINDI - Yes, rest your back.
Come back. Come back. Shift further back]

00:04:09.381 --> 00:04:13.007
Shri Mataji: [IN HINDI - yes, and sit 
straight, please. Okay]

Shri Mataji: [MARATHI]

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.879
Shri Mataji: [IN HINDI - Now see Doctor 
saab] these people call it migraine.

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:51.290
It's something so much miraculous trouble
called migraine and migraine can be with two

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:57.392
problems. One, either the stomach or the
brain; It cannot be third problem, so

00:04:57.392 --> 00:05:03.472
because you see, we call it the Vishnu tatwa,
the evolving force, you see, is in the brain

00:05:04.288 --> 00:05:07.838
Shri Mataji: [IN HINDI - Just move forward]
which gives us the awareness.

00:05:07.838 --> 00:05:14.277
[HINDI - No, no this portion you keep like
this. Come back a little, yes. Now keep]

00:05:14.277 --> 00:05:21.397
[HINDI - both hands in front, yes sit like
this. Yes, Now], what happens, that there

00:05:21.397 --> 00:05:27.650
is a principle of evolution within us. The
principle evolution starts from the stomach.

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:34.430
We start evolving when we feel hungry to begin
with. Then we start growing in that principle;

00:05:35.184 --> 00:05:40.854
Our awareness starts improving so that our
brain also develops. According to Sahaja yoga,

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:46.580
according to Sahaja yog - I don't know, if
Medical Science would accept or not -

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:52.972
but according to Sahaja yog the fat of the
stomach is converted into brain cells

00:05:53.651 --> 00:06:00.371
by the aortic plexus - not actually aortic
plexus by Swadhishthan Chakra - which

00:06:00.371 --> 00:06:06.065
is used by the brain because brain is using
it's energy all the time and it has to be replaced,

00:06:06.065 --> 00:06:12.059
so these special cells come from the
stomach. So, there are only two things

00:06:12.059 --> 00:06:18.964
that can give you a headache - one is of
the brain or the stomach. Now, the stomach

00:06:18.964 --> 00:06:26.113
problem could be the liver. See, liver is
something we do not understand much because

00:06:26.113 --> 00:06:32.526
liver is supposed to be a very secretive
stuff but for Sahaja Yoga liver is very simple.

00:06:33.071 --> 00:06:40.331
Liver is caused because of too much thinking,
because of too much of attention outside

00:06:40.331 --> 00:06:46.762
because when you start thinking too much, then
the same cells which are required for the brain

00:06:46.762 --> 00:06:52.421
which are to be produced by one center,
has to look after the brain and then, it

00:06:52.421 --> 00:07:00.516
neglects other organs like liver, like 
spleen, like pancreas, like kidneys so,

00:07:00.516 --> 00:07:07.764
such a person can get a high blood pressure,
can get diabetes, can get troubles with the,

00:07:09.441 --> 00:07:14.251
say, with the spleen or other troubles
that are caused by being, even

00:07:14.251 --> 00:07:19.233
leukemia it can [UNCLEAR - COPE TO?]. 
Then, with the pancreas you can get diabetes -

00:07:19.233 --> 00:07:25.113
like that - so, because that is neglected,
the balance has to be brought in and

00:07:25.113 --> 00:07:29.348
such a person has to be brought to the balanced
state. Such a person, who thinks too much,

00:07:29.348 --> 00:07:35.797
is, we call him as a right-sided man and
a right-sided man must be brought to

00:07:36.561 --> 00:07:42.051
the left side a little bit. So what we do,
you see, if you are too right-sided, your

00:07:42.051 --> 00:07:49.058
left side is neglected - emotionally you
become dry or frozen and the left side

00:07:49.058 --> 00:07:54.441
becomes over-excited - it requires more
sustenance, so what we do, is to raise your

00:07:54.441 --> 00:07:59.884
left side, like this for all this and ultimately
the heart because heart is also neglected

00:07:59.884 --> 00:08:04.719
because ego is created too much and it
engulfs the heart and that's how people

00:08:04.719 --> 00:08:10.459
get heart troubles because your attention
is outside, in the heart resides the Spirit -

00:08:10.459 --> 00:08:16.655
you don't pay any attention to your Spirit,
so the heart also collapses; It is so simple as that.

00:08:16.655 --> 00:08:21.438
At the root point, I'm saying, so what you 
have to do, is to put left to the right or

00:08:21.438 --> 00:08:26.656
under all these circumstances when you
suffer from the right side activity. So,

00:08:26.656 --> 00:08:32.875
what you do, is to put your left hand like
this and put it up like that and bring it down

00:08:32.875 --> 00:08:40.400
right. Those who have got, not all, not all.
Those who have got right-sided problem

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:48.038
must - high blood pressure or diabetes
have to do like this. Say about, those who

00:08:48.038 --> 00:08:55.982
have to do intensively should do 108 times.
Just like this, if you think too much, like this

00:08:55.982 --> 00:09:01.396
108 times. So, your thinking will be first
reduced. First you have to come to balance.

00:09:01.499 --> 00:09:06.389
Now the balance also about dharma, if you
start thinking too much, then you also are

00:09:06.389 --> 00:09:09.832
imbalanced. Dharma is to be
established within yourself.

00:09:09.832 --> 00:09:13.481
This is only possible in Sahaja Yoga,
when you get your realization,

00:09:13.481 --> 00:09:18.084
when your Prana pratishtha is done, then
you try to try to balance yourself

00:09:18.084 --> 00:09:24.271
and then the ascent is better, so the
central path of Sushumna, which

00:09:24.271 --> 00:09:30.538
is actually expressed as Para Sympathetic,
becomes wider and the Kundalini rises better

00:09:30.538 --> 00:09:36.144
and you are stabilized in Sahaj yoga.
So, you start from the left hand side.

00:09:36.144 --> 00:09:41.831
Now, raise it up and put it on
your head and put it down.

00:09:41.831 --> 00:09:46.690
Again you raise it, so you give yourself
a balance. Again you raise it up -

00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:52.805
at least three times. Three times
[MARATHI]. Three times,

00:09:52.805 --> 00:10:01.245
seven times or twenty-one times, fifty-one
times and 108 times, depending on the

00:10:01.245 --> 00:10:09.218
intensity of the trouble. Now, if your attention
is not on the Spirit and outside too much,

00:10:09.218 --> 00:10:13.843
then the Spirit recedes back. When it
recedes back, you get heart attack.

00:10:13.843 --> 00:10:20.855
All heart troubles are caused because of
that. Now supposing a child [MARATHI]

00:10:20.855 --> 00:10:24.186
then the parents [MARATHI]

00:10:24.186 --> 00:10:29.315
[MARATHI]

00:10:29.315 --> 00:10:33.980
[MARATHI]

00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:38.590
futuristic, very futuristic. [HINDI - The
whole day and night do you think only this,]

00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:43.333
[HINDI - 'What should we cook today, what should
we cook tomorrow? What to cook in the evening?']

00:10:43.333 --> 00:10:45.618
[HINDI - The children get troubles
because of this.]

00:10:45.618 --> 00:10:51.808
SY: [MARATHI]

00:10:51.808 --> 00:11:00.242
Shri Mataji: [MARATHI]

00:11:00.242 --> 00:11:07.416
[MARATHI]

00:11:07.416 --> 00:11:13.746
[MARATHI]

00:11:13.746 --> 00:11:24.755
[MARATHI]

00:11:24.755 --> 00:11:28.966
[MARATHI]

00:11:28.966 --> 00:11:37.785
And also it goes, it is, these diseases
are mostly found in the people, who are

00:11:37.785 --> 00:11:41.487
in certain communities, you see, those
who have such ideas.

00:11:41.487 --> 00:11:45.110
In India also you'll find people,
who are very futuristic,

00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:50.031
extremely futuristic, you see, specially
in Punjab - extremely futuristic -

00:11:50.031 --> 00:11:55.023
materialistic and futuristic; Such people
get heart attacks. Heart is first

00:11:55.023 --> 00:11:58.976
because their attention is not on the
Spirit. [HINDI - Did you understand?]

00:11:58.976 --> 00:12:04.023
Now, those people are, who are too much crying
type, weeping type, thinking of the past,

00:12:04.023 --> 00:12:10.720
ritualistic - they get the left side problems.
Left side problems are that you get possessed,

00:12:12.096 --> 00:12:18.456
all types of things happen to you
and also, those who are very futuristic,

00:12:18.456 --> 00:12:22.623
people also, if somehow or the other,
they get to people, who are dealing

00:12:22.623 --> 00:12:29.333
with the left side black magic or whatever
it is, they can get into troubles like,

00:12:29.333 --> 00:12:34.365
leukemia or they're triggered
- they're triggered into this.

00:12:34.555 --> 00:12:40.522
I saw a very nice program from
BBC - the doctors did it -

00:12:40.522 --> 00:12:48.221
very wonderful program, I should say and
they said that, "In our being there is an

00:12:48.221 --> 00:12:53.811
area built-in since our creation," and
that is, of course, according to us is

00:12:53.811 --> 00:12:59.872
Collective Subconscious - alright? "So,
from that area an attack comes by some

00:12:59.872 --> 00:13:04.031
proteins;" They call it Protein 52, 58 -
name anything - I mean, you could call it

00:13:04.031 --> 00:13:09.675
by any name, "and these attack. Once
they attack then the cancer is triggered."

00:13:10.213 --> 00:13:15.453
Very near our point is that we call them
the spirits and they call them Protein 58.

00:13:15.453 --> 00:13:20.757
Whatever you call them but we call them
spirits. Even virus infection is from the,

00:13:20.867 --> 00:13:28.787
from such vegetables which have gone out
of the circulation of evolution. Even

00:13:29.107 --> 00:13:38.016
these things like leukemia and cancer and
all these diseases are triggered by these

00:13:38.234 --> 00:13:44.044
dead spirits you can call them or dead things,
which have gone out of the circulation of evolution

00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:49.050
because, if you start moving towards the
left too much, you are very emotional type,

00:13:49.050 --> 00:13:53.000
you cry and weep too much and all that,
you move that side. Once you start moving

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:59.666
that side, you become aware of the
Collective Subconscious, then they attack you.

00:13:59.666 --> 00:14:03.890
If you are very ambitious and all that,
you can go to the right side too much

00:14:03.890 --> 00:14:09.999
and then you can become like Hitler. For
example, what Hitler did, that he created

00:14:09.999 --> 00:14:16.578
an atmosphere of Collective Supra Conscious
- charged them with great ambitions and future

00:14:16.578 --> 00:14:20.645
and then attacked them and these people
could not even think what they were doing,

00:14:20.645 --> 00:14:25.425
you see, the way they behaved and killed
people. So, there are two types of people

00:14:25.425 --> 00:14:32.219
in this world basically - one who are
left-sided, one who are right-sided.

00:14:32.396 --> 00:14:38.316
So, in Sanskrit language they are called
as Tamogunis and Rajogunis. The central

00:14:38.316 --> 00:14:43.910
ones are the Satwagunis - the one who keep
the balance. Balancing people are Satwagunis -

00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:48.206
not those who eat vegetables. This is a
wrong idea people have that, if you

00:14:48.206 --> 00:14:53.852
eat vegetable, you become Satwaguni. You
have seen we have communities, who are just,

00:14:53.852 --> 00:15:00.235
don't even eat garlic but they are extremely
aggressive people; So, is not true -

00:15:00.235 --> 00:15:06.833
is the balance of the temperament that is
important. Balance of the temperament,

00:15:06.833 --> 00:15:13.300
balance in life - a person who leads a
balanced life, is really a dharmic person.

00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:18.985
The one who's an extremist, for example,
some people who are very radical or

00:15:18.985 --> 00:15:24.111
they are fanatic and they believe into one
idea that, "This is the truth, this is the truth,"

00:15:24.111 --> 00:15:31.703
you see, such people become extremely charged
and they can be very much in imbalance

00:15:31.703 --> 00:15:41.563
and if they ever are triggered by the left side
Proteins 58 and 52, then they can catch cancer.

00:15:41.563 --> 00:15:49.413
So, fanaticism is also against nature -
any extreme behavior or extreme belief.

00:15:49.413 --> 00:15:54.535
Now, many people say, "Mother, but it is
written in this book, written in that book."

00:15:54.535 --> 00:15:59.313
Alright, so, so many things are written
in these books but we have seen

00:15:59.313 --> 00:16:06.550
it doesn't do any good. What does, what
is the thing you should expect in life is,

00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:12.283
what happens to you really, what do you
achieve out of it, not what your mental

00:16:12.283 --> 00:16:17.906
projection is. Now you believe that, this
pole is the tree. Supposing you believe in it.

00:16:17.906 --> 00:16:21.968
Who can tell you it is not, unless and
until you see yourself.

00:16:21.968 --> 00:16:28.115
If you believe into something just by mental
projection, then you cannot reach the truth.

00:16:28.115 --> 00:16:33.159
You have to keep yourself open and see
for yourself because beyond this mind,

00:16:33.159 --> 00:16:39.733
beyond this mind, is the realm of
Eternity because this mind is limited.

00:16:40.256 --> 00:16:47.976
This is a limited mind and this mind, if it has
to go to unlimited, you have to go beyond that.

00:16:47.976 --> 00:16:52.171
How do you go? By thinking about it,
again you are in the same bondage.

00:16:53.259 --> 00:16:57.529
With the bondage you cannot go, so the
bondage has to be broken, something has to

00:16:57.529 --> 00:17:02.675
trigger it and for that triggering, God has
given you this great thing called Kundalini.

00:17:02.675 --> 00:17:08.455
She's within you, within all of you and
you all have to take advantage of it.

00:17:09.147 --> 00:17:14.727
There is nothing like believing in Sahaja
Yoga because it's all mental projection.

00:17:14.727 --> 00:17:19.513
Don't believe in anything, first of all.
First of all, you get to your Spirit.

00:17:19.513 --> 00:17:23.956
Then Spirit is Absolute. Then the Spirit
tells you what to believe in because

00:17:23.956 --> 00:17:28.399
you start feeling the cool breeze in the
hand with that. Now, for example,

00:17:28.399 --> 00:17:32.253
our doctor was there yesterday - she
immediately started feeling the different

00:17:32.253 --> 00:17:38.436
centers - immediately, because you just
Absolute. You don't say anything, nothing.

00:17:38.436 --> 00:17:42.208
You don't have to say, it just works out.
If you say, "Oh, this is burning." It just

00:17:42.208 --> 00:17:46.776
works out and if this works out, what does
that mean. If this works out, what does

00:17:46.776 --> 00:17:51.261
that mean? That is the only thing I have
to do is to decode it and you have to

00:17:51.261 --> 00:17:56.563
understand after I have decoded it,
how to cure - is as simple as that.

00:17:56.563 --> 00:18:01.092
In Sahaja yoga there's no aggression
and there's no regression. You are just

00:18:01.092 --> 00:18:07.952
standing on reality. To see thing how it
works out and how it is going to help humanity.

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:17.680
Shri Mataji:[IN HINDI - You are alright
now, get up. How are you feeling?]

00:18:18.329 --> 00:18:22.769
SY: [IN HINDI - I am able to get up now]
Shri Mataji: [IN HINDI - Can get up now - it's started.]

00:18:22.769 --> 00:18:26.090
You just see his left nabhi. 
[IN HINDI - Where is your wife?]

00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:28.180
SY: [IN HINDI: She's not there.]
Shri Mataji: [IN HINDI -When did she die?]

00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:29.882
SY: [IN HINDI - She's not dead.]
Shri Mataji: [IN HINDI - Then where is she?]

00:18:29.882 --> 00:18:32.448
SY: [IN HINDI - She's left.]
Shri Mataji: [IN HINDI - That's the problem]

00:18:32.448 --> 00:18:37.219
Now this nobody can believe [UNCLEAR] that
his wife has gone away that's why he's suffering

00:18:37.219 --> 00:18:42.349
from the Left Nabhi because Left Nabhi -
this is Left Nabhi and Left Nabhi is here.

00:18:42.349 --> 00:18:49.125
Is the place of the Grihalaxmi, is the
woman of the house. If your Grihalaxmi

00:18:49.125 --> 00:18:53.987
is not respectable, you might get it or if
she is not respected also you'll get it.

00:18:54.867 --> 00:19:00.277
She must be respectable and is to be respected.
Specially in India most of them get this

00:19:00.323 --> 00:19:05.643
because we don't respect our Grihalaxmis
so much while in England people get it right

00:19:05.643 --> 00:19:14.655
because women don't respect their
husbands. It's a question of imbalance.

00:19:14.655 --> 00:19:21.387
The women have to be respectable
and men have to respect them.

00:19:21.708 --> 00:19:27.938
[IN SANSKRIT - Yatra narya poojyante, tatra
ramante devta] The women if they are respected

00:19:27.938 --> 00:19:36.026
and if they are not respectable, they are no use.
So you have to be respectable and you are to
be respected.

00:19:36.026 --> 00:19:40.067
[IN HINDI - And this is left nabhi, you got
it from your wife. What is your wife's name?]

00:19:40.691 --> 00:19:45.911
SY: [HINDI - In English, She's called Tricoza
but in Hebrew she's called Tofaha]

00:19:45.911 --> 00:19:47.494
Shri Mataji: Tofaha?
SY: Tofaha.

00:19:47.494 --> 00:19:49.833
Shri Mataji: [HINDI - Then what's she, Jew?]
SY: [HINDI - She's Jew]

00:19:51.286 --> 00:19:55.136
Shri Mataji: [HINDI - Now your leg is
okay.You can walk straight.]
SY: Hmm

00:19:55.796 --> 00:19:58.204
Shri Mataji: Thinking her name also.

00:19:58.204 --> 00:20:00.541
[HINDI - Then where has she gone? 
Has she gone to Israel?

00:20:00.541 --> 00:20:02.464
SY: [HINDI - No, she's here only. 
She married someone else.]

00:20:02.464 --> 00:20:05.256
Shri Mataji: Annh?
SY: [HINDI - She's here only
- married someone else]

00:20:06.192 --> 00:20:10.592
Shri Mataji: [HINDI - Then leave such a woman]
SY: [HINDI - Have left her. 20 years
have passed at least - 22 years]

00:20:10.592 --> 00:20:12.840
Shri Mataji: [HINDI - And children?]
SY: England

00:20:13.484 --> 00:20:16.974
Shri Mataji: [HINDI - Now it has started
happening in India also.]

00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:26.100
[HINDI - Your leg is alright now. Lift it,
raise it above. See, you are alright now?
You are alright now. Now leave her]

00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:32.491
[MARATHI] 
[HINDI - Okay, now you.]

00:20:32.491 --> 00:20:36.711
[HINDI - Is your hand shaking now, see? See
which finger of yours? No, keep hand like this.]

00:20:36.711 --> 00:20:42.960
[HINDI - It's not any such thing. It's
obvious. You have got nervous trouble,
nervous trouble is there.]

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:48.010
[HINDI - In nervous trouble, see your left
side is shaking more. We have to rectify that first]

00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:52.866
[HINDI - On the ground. Bow to Mother
Earth first and keep your hand on it] 
She will suck your problem.

00:20:52.866 --> 00:20:58.708
[HINDI - All problems of the nerves are
sucked by Mother Earth. Yesterday there
was a man - he has gone?]

00:20:58.708 --> 00:21:03.129
[HINDI - His hands were shaking a lot.
He just put one hand towards Me and put]

00:21:03.129 --> 00:21:08.184
[HINDI - one hand on the Mother Earth. Keep like
this, on the ground. No, no on the ground outside]

00:21:08.184 --> 00:21:11.121
[HINDI - You come from the front.
On the open ground, yes, it's alright]

00:21:11.121 --> 00:21:14.008
[MARATHI]

00:21:14.008 --> 00:21:19.282
[HINDI - Yes, brother keep this hand towards
Me. Yes, now see. The ground that is,]

00:21:19.282 --> 00:21:23.502
[HINDI - you have respected it. Do
you believe in this Holy land?]

00:21:23.502 --> 00:21:26.573
SY: [HINDI - Yes, I believe]
Shri Mataji: [HINDI - India is a very big, pure,]

00:21:26.573 --> 00:21:33.847
[HINDI - holy land. Okay. so what have
you done for this holy land. What have
you done for your country?]

00:21:35.972 --> 00:21:45.362
[HINDI - What have you done for this India?]
SY: [HINDI - Actually, I was in service with

00:21:45.362 --> 00:21:52.049
[HINDI - the Government of India, after that
I did some business but actually, for the]

00:21:52.049 --> 00:21:57.395
[HINDI - Mother Earth, I have done nothing.]
Shri Mataji: [HINDI - Okay you were
in the Government of India?]

00:21:57.395 --> 00:21:59.509
SY: [HINDI - Yes]
Shri Mataji: [HINDI - So you've done that,]

00:21:59.509 --> 00:22:03.000
[HINDI - that is enough. Government of
India is also made of this Mother Earth only]

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:08.005
[HINDI - Everything is made from this
earth only. We have no right on the sky,]

00:22:08.005 --> 00:22:10.654
SY: [HINDI - Yes, please]
Shri Mataji: [HINDI - it's only on
the Earth that we have a right]

00:22:11.457 --> 00:22:14.857
[HINDI - So, in which department were you?]
SY: [HINDI - I was in the Railways.]

00:22:14.857 --> 00:22:16.463
Shri Mataji: [HINDI - What?]
SY: Railway department.

00:22:20.513 --> 00:22:24.703
Shri Mataji: [HINDI - Actually, the government
servants work more than required]

00:22:25.555 --> 00:22:32.405
[HINDI - and, I don't mean that you don't do,
you should work. It's very important to work

00:22:32.405 --> 00:22:36.940
[HINDI - but they don't look after their
wife and children. Isn't it right? ]

00:22:37.123 --> 00:22:45.183
[HINDI - They neglect their household and thus
they don't look after their emotional side, isn't it?]

00:22:45.183 --> 00:22:49.131
SY: [HINDI - Emotional [UNCLEAR] not much]
Shri Mataji: [HINDI - Then you have to be emotional.]

00:22:49.131 --> 00:22:55.221
[HINDI - When you do government job, do it
emotionally with the thought that you are]

00:22:55.221 --> 00:23:00.758
[HINDI - serving your mother. If you do
like this, you will never have any problem]

00:23:00.758 --> 00:23:06.357
[HINDI - But if you work with the thought
that you are developing it, you are developing]

00:23:06.357 --> 00:23:11.515
[HINDI - the country or I am serving the
Railways, then there's an issue.]

00:23:11.515 --> 00:23:18.698
[HINDI - I am serving my country, Mother India, if
you do your government job with this feeling,]

00:23:18.698 --> 00:23:24.732
[HINDI - then the effect will not be so 
much. You should be attached emotionally.]

00:23:27.272 --> 00:23:33.182
SY: [HINDI - Would like to tell You this also,
that after service of 25 years and leaving it]

00:23:33.182 --> 00:23:39.389
SY: [HINDI - I did poultry farming for 20 years,
here in Poona. 20 years poultry farming,]

00:23:39.389 --> 00:23:45.758
SY: [HINDI - poultry breeding, and in that
I can say that I served Mother Earth little bit]

00:23:45.758 --> 00:23:51.557
Shri Mataji: [HINDI - Served or gained out of it?]
SY: [HINDI - Gained also a lot, gained a lot]

00:23:51.557 --> 00:23:55.075
Shri Mataji: [HINDI - So, this give and
take of the Mother Earth remains]

00:23:55.782 --> 00:24:03.672
[HINDI - How much we gain from it, we should
give back. You should decide in your life]

00:24:03.672 --> 00:24:09.769
[HINDI - that you have done a lot. Now I will
do something for India too, for the world also.]

00:24:09.769 --> 00:24:13.551
[HINDI - We all always think about
ourselves only - isn't it?]

00:24:13.551 --> 00:24:18.445
SY: [HINDI - Yes, but since the last 2 years,
I'm totally retired. Now I'm doing nothing.]

00:24:18.445 --> 00:24:24.017
Shri Mataji: [HINDI - No, then you do something. 
Now you do Sahaja yog and serve God 
for sometime]

00:24:24.017 --> 00:24:26.781
SY: [HINDI - Thinking of serving God]
Shri Mataji: [HINDI - Will you do? Then it's okay]

00:24:26.781 --> 00:24:33.040
[HINDI - You serve God, every problem
will go away. Okay?] Just take him out and

00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:43.342
put him left to the right and he has a heart.
Just, please. [HINDI - Take him inside.]

00:24:43.342 --> 00:24:48.661
[HINDI - Sahaja yogis will see you. It's
alright, they'll see you - make you feel lighter.]

00:24:48.661 --> 00:24:53.490
[HINDI - Get up, please. Get up slowly,
they'll see you] [MARATHI]

00:24:53.490 --> 00:24:57.352
SY: [MARATHI]
Shri Mataji: [MARATHI]

00:24:57.352 --> 00:25:03.274
[MARATHI]

00:25:10.443 --> 00:25:15.723
[MARATHI]

00:25:15.723 --> 00:25:19.564
[MARATHI]

00:25:19.564 --> 00:25:26.127
[HINDI - Should be. You Gujaratis, have you
become English? Annh?. You should learn to]

00:25:26.127 --> 00:25:34.500
[HINDI - live in the Indian style, 
properly. Indians have become very English]

00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:39.040
[MARATHI]

00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:42.240
[HINDI - Live like Indians. Whichever country
you belong to, you should live like that only]

00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:49.304
[HINDI - Shouldn't uproot. English become
Indians, no use. Can you grow]

00:25:49.304 --> 00:25:53.521
[HINDI - any other fruit from mango.
Only mango will grow out of mango tree.]

00:25:53.521 --> 00:25:58.430
[HINDI - Whichever country you belong to,
live like that only. God has made a variety]

00:25:58.430 --> 00:26:03.080
[HINDI - of people, different types of faces,
different types of [UNCLEAR], in that]

00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:12.966
[HINDI - why do you want to change that
variety? Everything different looks beautiful]

00:26:12.966 --> 00:26:17.227
[HINDI - If everybody looks the same, it will
appear like military people coming forward]

00:26:17.227 --> 00:26:22.646
[HINDI - Isn't it, just tell? There'll be no fun
in life. Various types of people should be there]

00:26:22.646 --> 00:26:26.433
[HINDI - and Gujaratis are turning very
English. And in London I'm seeing them]

00:26:26.433 --> 00:26:31.458
[HINDI - Making themselves very peculiar.
No need to become English. Live like Indians]

00:26:31.458 --> 00:26:37.890
[HINDI - We are Indians, live like Indians
- understood? We should live like Indians]

00:26:37.890 --> 00:26:44.217
[HINDI - No need to live in English style.
Let English people live in their style]

00:26:44.217 --> 00:26:47.926
[HINDI - Let Indians live in Indian style,
let Chinese live in Chinese style.]

00:26:47.926 --> 00:26:53.712
[HINDI - What's the use. Wherever a dress
is made, for that dress whatever suits,]

00:26:53.712 --> 00:26:58.405
[HINDI - whatever is beneficial, wear that.
In our country those dresses come and]

00:26:58.405 --> 00:27:03.539
[HINDI - finish off very soon. They do come but do
not stay because they are not suitable here]

00:27:03.539 --> 00:27:08.015
[HINDI - in the heat. If we ask for those
warm dresses from there, they go waste]

00:27:08.015 --> 00:27:10.710
[HINDI - as people can't use them and discard
them. How many days will they last,]

00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:14.932
[HINDI - you only tell Me. Here only kurta
pyjama will only suit and if you wear suit etc]

00:27:14.932 --> 00:27:20.380
[HINDI - you'll feel uneasy due to the heat. Doesn't
it happen? Either they have to make in cotton.]

00:27:20.380 --> 00:27:25.946
[HINDI - Can't wear warm clothes. Thus
the traditional dresses made here for us]

00:27:25.946 --> 00:27:32.669
[HINDI - which are useful for us, should be
worn. And if possible, we should wear dresses]

00:27:32.669 --> 00:27:38.204
[HINDI - of our country, no need to follow
any one else, no need to uproot yourself]

00:27:38.204 --> 00:27:47.210
[HINDI - It's useless. Is it alright now?]
SY: [MARATHI]

00:27:47.210 --> 00:27:49.140
Shri Mataji: Annh?
SY: [MARATHI]

00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:59.238
Shri Mataji: [MARATHI]

00:28:05.482 --> 00:28:07.442
Shri Mataji: [MARATHI]

00:28:07.546 --> 00:28:11.756
[HINDI - What problem does he have?]
SY: Diabetes, diabetes

00:28:11.756 --> 00:28:17.005
Shri Mataji: [HINDI - Only diabetes, nothing else?
How many people have diabetes come in front.]

00:28:17.005 --> 00:28:21.785
[HINDI - All, who have diabetes.]
SYogi: All those with diabetes, come forward. Please stand]

00:28:21.785 --> 00:28:28.180
Shri Mataji: [HINDI - This you found
out good. Diabetes - only three people]

00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:30.259
SYogi: All those who have diabetes,
please come up.

00:28:30.259 --> 00:28:33.573
Shri Mataji: I must say, Poona is great,
you have very few diabetes patients.

00:28:34.699 --> 00:28:38.609
SYogi: [HINDI - People with diabetes,
please stand up. People with diabetes.]

00:28:38.609 --> 00:28:42.237
Shri Mataji: [HINDI - Okay, come here.
Sit down. Only 2-3. It's okay - diabetes]

00:28:42.237 --> 00:28:46.264
[HINDI - Nothing difficult, do 
come, do come. Come in front]

00:28:46.264 --> 00:28:51.469
SYogi: Sugar trouble, diabetes
Shri Mataji: [HINDI - Okay.]

00:28:57.983 --> 00:29:03.343
Shri Mataji: [HINDI - Come sit down]

anyone, on her left arm.

00:44:09.441 --> 00:44:11.141

Shri Mataji: [MARATHI]

00:44:42.613 --> 00:44:47.517
Hmm, now better? Still not

00:44:51.470 --> 00:45:00.070
[MARATHI]

00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:09.324
[MARATHI]

00:45:10.471 --> 00:45:15.261
You take him inside, I think, would
be better. [MARATHI]

00:45:15.261 --> 00:45:23.316
He has got, I think, jaundice sort of a thing, 
liver. Give him some [HINDI - Radish leaves]

00:45:23.316 --> 00:45:29.286
SYogi: [HINDI - Radish leaves (UNCLEAR),
radish leaves]

00:45:29.286 --> 00:45:33.468
Shri Mataji: [MARATHI]

00:45:34.397 --> 00:45:40.587
[MARATHI]

00:45:41.122 --> 00:45:45.922
Shri Mataji: [MARATHI]

[MARATHI]

00:46:41.422 --> 00:46:48.732
Hmm [MARATHI] relax

00:46:48.952 --> 00:46:57.022
[MARATHI]

00:46:57.318 --> 00:47:05.888
Can somebody see her now? She's much
better. Come along. [MARATHI]

00:47:08.432 --> 00:47:11.742
Shri Mataji: [MARATHI]

00:47:11.742 --> 00:47:19.952
Shri Mataji: [CONVERSATION IN MARATHI]

00:47:19.952 --> 00:47:26.619
Shri Mataji: [MARATHI]

00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:38.090
Shri Mataji: [CONVERSATION IN MARATHI]

00:47:39.412 --> 00:47:42.342
Shri Mataji: Your eyes are not alright?
SYogini: Yes

00:47:42.342 --> 00:47:51.606
Turn around. [UNCLEAR] You can't see?
SYogini: No, I can see [UNCLEAR]

00:47:51.606 --> 00:47:58.559
Shri Mataji: [NAME UNCLEAR] turn around
[HINDI - Are you getting cool breeze? 
Getting cool breeze. Are you getting it?]

00:47:59.552 --> 00:48:04.412
Shri Mataji: [CONVERSATION IN MARATHI]

00:48:04.412 --> 00:48:11.976
Shri Mataji: [CONVERSATION IN MARATHI]

00:48:12.477 --> 00:48:18.607
[HINDI - Keep your hand on your stomach.
Left hand. Towards the left side? ]

00:48:18.607 --> 00:48:25.084
[HINDI - Keep hand on the left side,
on spleen. Keep your right hand,
left hand towards Me. Yes, it's alright]

00:48:26.062 --> 00:48:32.392
Shri Mataji: Hmm [MARATHI] What'it?
SYogi: Much better now, Mother, the polio boy

00:48:32.392 --> 00:48:35.019
Shri Mataji: What boy?
SYogi: Polio

00:48:35.019 --> 00:48:37.334
Shri Mataji: [HINDI - Yes]
SYogi: Much better
Shri Mataji: Much better.

00:48:47.165 --> 00:48:56.145
Shri Mataji: Take out your [HINDI - Spectacles]
If you can bring some light for him. I
would like to cure his Agnya.

00:48:56.625 --> 00:48:58.915
SYogi: Mother,
Shri Mataji: Hmm
SYogi: What does he want, light?

00:48:58.915 --> 00:49:05.950
Shri Mataji: [HINDI - Yes. In his this portion there
is darkness. If this is shown light, it will be cured]

00:49:09.368 --> 00:49:16.018
Shri Mataji: [MARATHI] [HINDI - Where has
My handkerchief fallen?]

00:49:16.385 --> 00:49:21.445
Shri Mataji: [MARATHI]

00:49:21.445 --> 00:49:27.195
Shri Mataji: [CONVERSATION IN MARATHI]

00:49:27.195 --> 00:49:35.455
Shri Mataji: [CONVERSATION IN MARATHI]

00:49:35.455 --> 00:49:43.725
Shri Mataji: [CONVERSATION IN MARATHI]

00:49:43.725 --> 00:49:47.179
Dry ginger powder and sugar to be taken
early in the morning during winter time,

00:49:47.179 --> 00:49:51.215
to be taken by this kind of migraine. 
It is due to liver problems.

00:49:51.215 --> 00:49:58.071
You feel [HINDI - like we say, nauseated]
you feel that [UNCLEAR], feel like vomiting

00:49:58.071 --> 00:50:06.342
and you, you don't like the Sun and you get
headache - all this is a sign of a bad liver.

00:50:06.342 --> 00:50:12.419
We have two types of livers.
One is a liver [ASIDE - MARATHI]

00:50:14.592 --> 00:50:22.132
One - one liver which is the thought and one
liver we call it as the cold liver - two types.

00:50:22.132 --> 00:50:28.365
That means, a liver that is sluggish and liver over
active. The person who has a very over-active liver,

00:50:28.365 --> 00:50:35.557
will be a thin person. The one who has a
sluggish, will be a person with a bigger body.

00:50:36.393 --> 00:50:42.533
The one who has got very active liver, will
have this kind of problems. He'll think too much,

00:50:42.533 --> 00:50:52.518
he'll vomit - we have many here[LAUGHS]
and he'll vomit and he will

00:50:56.275 --> 00:51:04.595
also do, sort of, over-activity, you see, and
he can't bear the Sun - all these things.

00:51:04.595 --> 00:51:10.117
Anything fried such a person eats or anything,
he gets into vomit. The other is the sluggish one.

00:51:10.117 --> 00:51:16.177
In the sluggish one, you get allergies, allergies
are with that kind of, which is a sluggish one.

00:51:16.177 --> 00:51:21.781
So that's how we have two types of livers.
For the first one, you have to give for the first one,

00:51:21.970 --> 00:51:28.130
you have to give, what you call this ...
[HINDI - dry ginger powder] and sugar or

00:51:28.130 --> 00:51:32.501
during winter time and summer time you have
to give kokum water with sugar but lot of

00:51:32.501 --> 00:51:38.834
sugar is needed for such a person and for the 
left side - sugar sustains the attention.

00:51:39.166 --> 00:51:44.146
Generally, we doctors say that don't take sugar
- is not possible. For the right-sided person,

00:51:44.146 --> 00:51:51.466
sugar is very essential, the left-sided
person - salt. Now for the left-sided person,

00:51:51.466 --> 00:51:57.501
you have to give something like geru, 
which is a Calcium in a very fine form,

00:51:57.501 --> 00:52:03.530
and it's a geru. Is very good to apply, if
they do not get rid of their allergies,

00:52:03.530 --> 00:52:08.201
to have some in, to get rid of your allergies
with Calcium but in childhood, if the

00:52:08.201 --> 00:52:14.015
children are giver Calcinol or Calcium
something, and Vitamin A and D
from the age of say,

00:52:14.015 --> 00:52:18.540
8 years to 12 years, you'll seldom,
you'll not get this allergic conditions.

00:52:18.540 --> 00:52:25.011
These allergic conditions only come in
because you do not have sufficient

00:52:25.713 --> 00:52:30.153
Calcium but after 12 years or 14 years,
you can't take much Calcium, you see.

00:52:30.153 --> 00:52:36.071
So the Calcium if it is given - not injections
but something that you eat in Calcium form

00:52:36.581 --> 00:52:40.633
in milk - but milk is sometimes not
sufficient, so give something -

00:52:40.807 --> 00:52:45.407
I think this Calcinol children like very
much, so best is to give all of them Calcium.

00:52:45.747 --> 00:52:49.634
I told, I mean when I went to Japan, I 
told people, why don't you take to Calcium?

00:52:49.634 --> 00:52:54.574
I was surprised, they are, now see how
Japanese have grown in heights, you get height

00:52:54.574 --> 00:53:01.828
and you develop a balance.
SYogi: This boy is light now, Mother.

00:53:02.186 --> 00:53:07.836
Shri Mataji: Are you feeling the cool
breeze in both the hands? Good.

00:53:10.314 --> 00:53:14.794
[HINDI - Brother are you feeling good? Are
you getting cool breeze on your head?]

00:53:14.794 --> 00:53:18.175
[HINDI - Keep your hand like this and see]
Just see this gentleman with diabetes -

00:53:18.175 --> 00:53:27.042
put him left to the right. Can you. John,
take him. Alright, this lady also [UNCLEAR]

00:53:27.042 --> 00:53:30.903
you look after her. She has got diabetes.
Put her left to the right and tell them

00:53:30.903 --> 00:53:35.180
what is to be done with the photograph.
Now which one is another diabetic patient?

00:53:35.180 --> 00:53:40.282
SYogi: Diabetes - any diabetic patient?
Shri Mataji: No, no, no.

00:53:43.362 --> 00:53:49.762
[HINDI - His Kundalini is at the base,
doesn't rise. Raise the Kundalini, raise it.]

00:53:50.211 --> 00:53:59.001
[HINDI - Still, still at the back. Hmm]
Are you feeling nice and joy?
[HINDI - Yes, keep your hands open]

00:53:59.001 --> 00:54:03.881
so that you get more vibrations, alright?
[HINDI -This is Chaitanya Lehri] You've read

00:54:03.881 --> 00:54:08.346
Swananda lehri, Chaitanya Lehri, have you
read Saundarya Lehri - these are the books

00:54:08.346 --> 00:54:11.983
you should read, alright? We should
not create Shabd-jalam.

00:54:11.983 --> 00:54:13.652
SY: Shri Aurobindo
Shri Mataji: Hmm?

00:54:13.652 --> 00:54:16.812
SY: Shri Aurobindo
Shri Mataji: No, no, no that's all

00:54:16.812 --> 00:54:23.637
shabd jalam again. Shri Aurobindo - just talk, talk,
talk, talk, talk, talk - alright? That makes you mad.

00:54:25.154 --> 00:54:30.224
That's why Kabira has said, [Hindi - 'Padhi,
Padhi pandit moorakh bhayo']. I didn't understand

00:54:30.224 --> 00:54:34.613
what he meant at that time but I've seen
now, people who read too much, it all goes

00:54:34.613 --> 00:54:39.234
into your head and they're all inside, you're
outside, you're nowhere. Too much reading

00:54:39.234 --> 00:54:41.988
isn't [UNCLEAR - USEFUL?]
SYogi: Experience is the best

00:54:41.988 --> 00:54:45.702
Shri Mataji: Experience alright. So now
you should try to experience, alright?

00:54:46.334 --> 00:54:49.684
Shri Mataji: [HINDI - Which problem do you say?]
SYogini: Spondylosis [HINDI - and
fell from the stairs]

00:54:49.684 --> 00:54:51.820
Shri Mataji: [HINDI - Okay, will have to
see you personally. And?

00:54:51.820 --> 00:54:56.040
SYogini: [MARATHI]
Shri Mataji: Hmm

00:54:56.040 --> 00:54:58.909
SYogini: [MARATHI]
Shri Mataji: Hmm

00:55:03.379 --> 00:55:12.319
[MARATHI]

00:55:13.177 --> 00:55:19.707
Hmm? Memory is on the left hand side. See, if
your memory is short, best is to raise your

00:55:19.707 --> 00:55:24.272
left and put it to the right.
SYogi: [HINDI - You do like this [UNCLEAR]

00:55:24.272 --> 00:55:30.493
Shri Mataji: [UNCLEAR] [MARATHI]

00:55:30.493 --> 00:55:33.683
[HINDI - Son, is the cool breeze coming?]
Are you feeling cool breeze in the hand?
SY: No

00:55:33.683 --> 00:55:36.382
SYogini: You said light for him

00:55:36.427 --> 00:55:38.777
Shri Mataji: [HINDI - What?]
SYogini: [HINDI - You said light for him]

00:55:38.777 --> 00:55:43.530
Shri Mataji: [HINDI - Wait, I'll do it just now,
I'll raise it. Don't worry for him, have
concern for yourself]

00:55:43.530 --> 00:55:49.011
Shri Mataji: [HINDI - Put both hands
towards Me. Concern for yourself]

00:55:49.011 --> 00:55:52.719
SY: [HINDI - Mother, my back is good
now but this is paining]
Shri Mataji: [HINDI - I'll do it just now]

00:55:52.719 --> 00:55:56.382
[HINDI - Everything is happening. Your back is
good just like that only. I'll do it in sometime.]

00:55:56.382 --> 00:55:59.557
[HINDI - I'm seeing everyone, isn't it?
Don't hurry. Just worry about yourself.]

00:55:59.557 --> 00:56:02.707
[HINDI - Okay, if I settle your back,
what will you do after that?]

00:56:03.396 --> 00:56:06.536
SY: [HINDI - I will serve Mother]
Shri Mataji: [HINDI - I don't need any service]

00:56:06.536 --> 00:56:09.914
[HINDI - I'm, Myself, serving all the
people, what is there to serve Me]

00:56:11.380 --> 00:56:17.260
SY: [HINDI - Keep Mother in my heart]
Shri Mataji: [HINDI - I don't need anything My child
but will you serve others, is the point]

00:56:18.338 --> 00:56:21.448
[HINDI - Will you serve others?]
SYogini: [HINDI - I do]

00:56:21.448 --> 00:56:23.357
Shri Mataji: [HINDI - What?]
SYogini: [HINDI - I already do]

00:56:23.357 --> 00:56:25.749
Shri Mataji: [HINDI - What?]
SYogini: [HINDI - Taking care of everyone]

00:56:25.749 --> 00:56:27.816
Shri Mataji: [HINDI - Like?]
SYogini: [HINDI - At home]

00:56:27.816 --> 00:56:31.918
Shri Mataji: [HINDI - Not at home. Everyone
looks after at home. Something outside also]

00:56:32.678 --> 00:56:40.967
[HINDI - Will you do, unnh? Will you help
everyone? Then it's okay, it has a meaning]

00:56:40.967 --> 00:56:47.735
[HINDI - otherwise what's the use of lighting
such lamps, which burn out at home only. Unnh?]

00:56:49.480 --> 00:56:52.620
What's it?
SYogi: Right Nabhi is still catching.

00:56:52.876 --> 00:57:01.066
Shri Mataji: Only?
SYogi: Left Agnya is much better. Still
bad, much better. Your hand is clearing that.

00:57:05.502 --> 00:57:11.852
[HINDI - Hmm, now it's alright. Are you feeling
the cool breeze, son?]
SY: [HINDI - Yes]

00:57:12.185 --> 00:57:15.655
Shri Mataji: [HINDI - No. you are
worrying for him. Nothing to worry.]

00:57:16.451 --> 00:57:20.731
[HINDI - I'm seeing/taking care of him. Don't
worry for him. My foot is on his back only.]

00:57:20.731 --> 00:57:29.296
[HINDI - Okay, you get your realization.
Hmm. You? Just worried for the child.]

00:57:29.296 --> 00:57:33.814
[HINDI - First get your realization so that you
don't ever get sick, child will also not be sick]

00:57:33.814 --> 00:57:38.658
[HINDI - You can cure the child also. You
have only one child, I have thousands.]

00:57:38.658 --> 00:57:44.042
[HINDI - For who all to worry, tell? For
one child you all are so concerned,]

00:57:44.042 --> 00:57:50.348
[HINDI - worry about the One who has thousands.
Leave it. The child will be completely well.]

00:57:50.348 --> 00:57:53.233
[HINDI - Leave the concern absolutely. The
child will be cured, taken up for that only, yes]

00:57:54.149 --> 00:57:59.519
[HINDI - You should be able to give up also.
Till you keep holding on, the work will not be done]

00:57:59.687 --> 00:58:07.047
[HINDI - Do you know the tale of Draupadi?
Draupadi's tale is such]

00:58:07.047 --> 00:58:16.715
[HINDI - that when the Pandavas lost her and
when she saw that now her chastity is at risk]

00:58:16.715 --> 00:58:22.793
[HINDI - when they started pulling her sari,
then she held her sari by her teeth, saying 'Kri']

00:58:22.793 --> 00:58:26.504
[HINDI - Why didn't she say, 'shna' because
she thought that the end of her sari would slip]

00:58:26.504 --> 00:58:28.942
[HINDI - so she kept on holding
between her teeth at 'Kri'. Till she]

00:58:28.942 --> 00:58:35.206
[HINDI - kept on holding at 'Kri' till then,
Krishna was sitting comfortably. As soon as]

00:58:35.206 --> 00:58:43.181
[HINDI - she left her sari and said, 'shna', then
'Shankh, chakra, gada, padma, garuda, lei sidhare']

00:58:46.003 --> 00:58:48.113
[HINDI - At the moment she said 'shna', then

00:58:48.113 --> 00:58:56.793
[HINDI - 'Dwarika mein shor bhayo, shor bhayo
bhari, Shankh, chakra, gada, padma,
garud lei sidhari']

00:58:59.714 --> 00:59:02.364
[HINDI - So, you should be able to leave
or give up also. Just now,]

00:59:02.364 --> 00:59:05.961
[HINDI - till you keep holding on, the
work will not be done. Just give it up.]

00:59:05.961 --> 00:59:11.429
Done. Better now? Annh, is it alright?
SYogi: Yes, Mother.

00:59:11.429 --> 00:59:13.601
Shri Mataji: It's coming out?
SYogi: Left agnya is clear, so it's coming out.

00:59:13.601 --> 00:59:19.409
Shri Mataji: So see, coming out, good! Now
don't think, don't think, don't think, don't think.

00:59:20.577 --> 00:59:27.037
SYogi: Still heat coming from Left Nabhi.
Shri Mataji: Hmm, left nabhi. Left nabhi 
right, doesn't matter.

00:59:28.078 --> 00:59:29.448
Still left is coming.
SYogi: Heat is coming out.

00:59:29.448 --> 00:59:32.879

01:21:01.516 --> 01:21:06.968
possessed by so many other people. You
see, all the rich people are always invaded

01:21:07.764 --> 01:21:17.074
by people who want money and somehow or
other, they think, he's so much invaded by people

01:21:18.545 --> 01:21:25.985
impossible. I don't want any money, you know that
very well but we have to organize it in a way where

01:21:25.985 --> 01:21:31.441
you don't need money, don't need money much,
but this now, see how Ahuja has arranged.

01:21:31.441 --> 01:21:36.306
We have paid for everything, he's not paid
for anything you can ask. We have not,

01:21:36.306 --> 01:21:41.002
he's not paid for [HINDI - Did you pay for anything
ever? We never took any money from you]

01:21:41.002 --> 01:21:46.287
SYogi: [HINDI - No]
Shri Mataji: Never but only thing, we all

01:21:46.287 --> 01:21:53.355
have to organize it properly, which was
not done. You have to organize it. You are

01:21:53.355 --> 01:21:59.442
such a well-known person in yoga - this is
real yoga, alright? Please try to help Me.

01:22:03.634 --> 01:22:11.504
Actually, we don't need any money - nothing - 
but organize it. Now, somebody has given Me

01:22:11.504 --> 01:22:16.695
a very beautiful land in Powai, absolutely
free - can you imagine - because I was

01:22:16.695 --> 01:22:22.594
insisting that, "I will not take anything
with black money," so somebody very kindly,

01:22:22.594 --> 01:22:29.860
has donated Me a free land - not to Me but to this
organization. As it is we have no organization,

01:22:29.860 --> 01:22:34.590
it's a living organization but we had to
have a Trustee, so we had some trustees

01:22:35.405 --> 01:22:41.785
and by God's Grace, I'm sure, we'll be able
to build something here but you have to talk

01:22:41.785 --> 01:22:47.549
to people about it, you have to bring them out.
He has done it. You see, I cured his heart, alright -

01:22:47.549 --> 01:22:52.531
I cured the heart of so many people who have... 
but I must say, it's special about him. The way

01:22:52.531 --> 01:23:00.022
he took it up upon himself. You are so influential,
you can do a lot, alright? Please try because

01:23:00.022 --> 01:23:06.395
this is the only way you can help others
in the genuine way. All other organizations

01:23:06.395 --> 01:23:14.651
of helping, is very superficial. So I have to
request you, God has put you in that position

01:23:14.651 --> 01:23:25.140
to do His job, alright. You are specially posted.
SYogi: Now he's always forward,

01:23:25.412 --> 01:23:28.022
Shri Mataji: He's very good but
[HINDI - the thing is]

01:23:28.022 --> 01:23:30.103
SYogi: he's never behind, he's always forward
Shri Mataji: [HINDI - but what happens]

01:23:30.103 --> 01:23:34.781
wrong type of people always grab these things
[HINDI - doesn't it happen, it happened
to you also]

01:23:34.781 --> 01:23:39.712
[HINDI - and we should take the genuine and
it should be given to those who deserve it]

01:23:39.712 --> 01:23:44.729
[HINDI - If you had not organized it here] I
mean, I would have done it - I'm doing already

01:23:44.729 --> 01:23:49.576
for thousands of people in the villages but say
Poona city, I would say, you have done a good thing

01:23:49.576 --> 01:23:54.896
for Poona city. In the same way, he can do a
lot in Bombay, I tell you - Mr. Fazalbhai can.

01:23:54.896 --> 01:24:04.020
I've met him thrice. You're better.
[HINDI - Aren't you? Come here behind]

01:24:10.651 --> 01:24:21.461
Now you see this Dhumaal. He's just a ordinary,
we should say, a farmer and he has given realization

01:24:21.461 --> 01:24:27.433
to ten thousand people and cured, I don't 
now, how many. So many have been cured but

01:24:27.433 --> 01:24:32.782
curing is not the main thing. It's first to get
to God. That's what Zoraster has said that,

01:24:32.782 --> 01:24:39.356
"You have to become." Becoming is the point.
We have one very great Parsi doctor here.

01:24:39.356 --> 01:24:44.143
I don't know if you have met him. Where
is Rustom? Rustom Burgorjee

01:24:44.143 --> 01:24:46.765
SY: He's inside
SYogi: He's attending to some patient

01:24:46.765 --> 01:24:51.123
Shri Mataji: He's gone out somewhere. You
must meet him. He's a Psychiatrist, he's

01:24:51.123 --> 01:24:56.258
also a doctor who, he's the consultant in
London, very big hospital, St. Thomas' Hospital

01:24:56.258 --> 01:25:09.696
and he's working it very well. This is absolutely
genuine. There's no question of money or anything

01:25:09.696 --> 01:25:16.956
What money can one pay for God's love - isn't
it? Very simple. Now this is extremely simple

01:25:16.956 --> 01:25:23.716
thing I gave you vibrated. Now you put it in a
katori(bowl) or something and put some water.

01:25:23.716 --> 01:25:28.486
It will never be spoilt. All the time you can
use it as a cream. Always whenever you want,

01:25:28.486 --> 01:25:34.657
you can put some water but don't use soap at all.
Just put this, leave it there and wash it off.

01:25:34.657 --> 01:25:40.405
The whole thing will come out and also good
for your liver, you can put it on your liver, little bit

01:25:40.405 --> 01:25:45.843
and then take it out. It will take out your
heat. But I would like you to take some sugar

01:25:45.843 --> 01:25:52.264
vibrated also, which you both should take because
both have liver problems and it will help you.

01:25:53.060 --> 01:25:57.960
Ask them to put their hands on the liver,
both of them - the right hand towards Me.

be fixed first. I have given vibrations and
cured it but he will turn your neck and fix it]

come and she's asking me to go to the park]

Me working also. He's come to America,
