1
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:13,150
I am so happy and joyous

2
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:17,590
to be here with so many Sahaja Yogis,

3
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:21,830
and so many of them are very new...

4
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:24,630
not very new to Me,

5
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:28,070
perhaps I have known all of you,

6
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:31,870
thousands of years back.

7
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:33,990
You are sitting in the sun.

8
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:54,790
In Sahaja Yoga you all have to understand one simple thing —

9
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:02,510
that you are the spirit.

10
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:10,110
And whatever is not the spirit

11
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:13,310
is not yourself.

12
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:22,390
We can compare spirit with the sun.

13
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:29,470
The sun can be covered with the clouds,

14
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:38,430
there could be superimpositions on the sun,

15
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:46,110
but sun remains as it is, at this point.

16
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:53,070
You cannot enlighten the sun.

17
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:58,470
It is illumined by itself.

18
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:04,870
Now, when the clouds are removed,

19
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:08,510
the superimpositions are removed,

20
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:18,070
the sun shines through the atmosphere.

21
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:25,110
So, our spirit is also

22
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:35,630
is superimposed by ignorance.

23
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:49,190
As long as there is superimposition,

24
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:52,390
you can't see the spirit.

25
00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:00,510
And even when few clouds disappear

26
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:10,470
the superimposition exists.

27
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:14,910
One has to have a clear sky

28
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:21,670
to see the light of the spirit shining through.

29
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:33,870
There are many ways by which we can try to remove the clouds.

30
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:46,550
The first and the foremost thing is the assumption, the faith

31
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,990
that you are the spirit

32
00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:01,590
and that the rest is superimposition.

33
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:08,230
You have to assume that within yourself —

34
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:15,910
after Realization it should become very easy —

35
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:21,910
that you are something much more,

36
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:27,830
something very different

37
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:32,430
from what you have known so far.

38
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:45,150
So, now the new situation arises —

39
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:54,910
that you do not have a blind faith,

40
00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:05,110
but you have a faith that has come out of an experience.

41
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:12,350
So your intellect should not fight it.

42
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:19,710
It should not try to challenge you.

43
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:27,750
If it challenges and if you hear to your intellect,

44
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:30,950
you'll again go down.

45
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:46,350
Even if you get the glimpse of a star in the sky,

46
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:58,430
then the scientist believe that there is a star.

47
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,430
So, in the same manner,

48
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:11,510
even if you get the glimpse of your Realization,

49
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:23,750
you have to at least believe that you are also a spirit.

50
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:34,390
You go on sticking on to that experience

51
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:40,550
and keeping your attention on the fact

52
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:44,350
that you are the spirit.

53
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:53,230
Tell your intellect not to cheat you anymore.

54
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:07,230
You can turn the face of your intellect by this.

55
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,910
Now your intellect will start working

56
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:19,150
for the pursuit of the spirit.

57
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:25,910
This is what faith means.

58
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:32,470
Faith means rise to pure intelligence.

59
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:47,870
Now, when you are seeing clouds removed to a great extent,

60
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:51,390
still there are clouds.

61
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:05,510
So you have to use the wind

62
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:11,110
to remove the clouds.

63
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:14,510
Wind of the Holy Ghost.

64
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:17,230
And that... you know,

65
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:24,590
there are many ways of taking advantage of the wind.

66
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:45,630
I hope the Italians understand.

67
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:05,790
So the wind comes from some other source,

68
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:19,870
that is the source of the Holy Ghost, your own Kundalini.

69
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:32,270
And also you have in person the Primordial Kundalini before you.

70
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:47,670
Compared to many other seekers who came before you,

71
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:51,350
I must say, you are very fortunate.

72
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:03,910
Because worshipping any vigraha,

73
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:12,910
any... even a statue of

74
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:19,270
self-created vibrations from the Mother Earth,

75
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:22,590
people had big problems.

76
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:41,870
They had to, first of all, do a meditation

77
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:46,230
which was called as Savikalpa Samadhi.

78
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,870
That means, in that state

79
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:59,550
you had to concentrate on such a statue, vigraha.

80
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:05,390
Vigraha means the one which is a vibrating statue.

81
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:14,150
And then, go on looking at that statue

82
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:19,110
and trying to raise your Kundalini.

83
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:30,870
And Kundalini used to come up to Agnya.

84
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:41,270
But the jumping beyond the Sahasrara was an impossible task,

85
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:51,990
because one had to go from form to formless,

86
00:12:56,990 --> 00:13:02,830
and it was so difficult, to get out of form to formless.

87
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:14,630
And even to concentrate on abstract or formless

88
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:16,870
was another impossible task

89
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:21,910
as the muslim did, or many other people tried to do.

90
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:40,630
Under these circumstances

91
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:46,630
it was necessary that the formless had to take a form,

92
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:55,350
so there was no more complication to you.

93
00:13:56,190 --> 00:14:03,430
As soon as you concentrated on the form,

94
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:06,630
you became formless.

95
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:16,710
Like if you have ice before you,

96
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:25,190
and as soon as you start touching the ice, it melts away,

97
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:31,870
and you start feeling the cool.

98
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:37,750
So the problem is very easily solved now.

99
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:43,510
Puja is one of the things

100
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:51,550
by which you can excite the forms into formless.

101
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:07,510
Now, your centers are the centers of energy.

102
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:17,830
But they, too, have a guiding deity sitting on all these chakras.

103
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:29,630
They are also the formless made into forms.

104
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:36,230
And when you do the puja,

105
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:41,230
the forms melt into formless energy,

106
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:52,630
and this formless energy then starts flowing,

107
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:03,390
and that, then blows the wind.

108
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:10,110
And that's how this misidentification,

109
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:14,830
superimpositions on the spirit are removed.

110
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:29,870
Now, you cannot think about the puja.

111
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:38,630
The whole thing happens in a realm which is beyond thinking.

112
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:46,150
So, you have to understand

113
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:51,030
that you cannot rationalize the puja.

114
00:16:54,750 --> 00:17:00,830
You should have the maximum advantage

115
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:09,110
on your chakras.

116
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:19,590
For that you must fully just concentrate on the puja

117
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:24,190
and how the wind is blowing.

118
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,990
And the wind will see to it,

119
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:36,510
that they drive out all the clouds.

120
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:47,710
So your only work is,

121
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:50,390
or your only method is —

122
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:56,070
just to concentrate on the puja, and witness.

123
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:05,390
You are a seer.

124
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:10,070
Seer has double meaning.

125
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:15,470
The one who sees only,

126
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:20,230
just sees,

127
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:24,830
and is only knowledge —

128
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:28,990
is a seer.

129
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:33,670
Without any thought, without any reaction,

130
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:39,150
just sees and absorb,

131
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:43,230
automatically, spontaneously —

132
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:48,550
is the seer.

133
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:57,430
And so, that is the best way to perform a puja.

134
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:06,990
For Me sometimes it's burdensome,

135
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:18,910
because there should be some parity between you and the deities.

136
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:26,670
Some balance must be there.

137
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:31,990
Here you are saying all the mantras and the deities are awakened,

138
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:33,790
and there you are,

139
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:38,990
who do not want to receive anything within your heart.

140
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:56,910
So I am the one who has to store up

141
00:19:57,150 --> 00:20:01,710
all the extra energy that is produced in the body.

142
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:15,870
So it would be better if you all keep your hearts open

143
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:20,750
and watch the puja without thinking about it.

144
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:37,630
Today we'll reverse the method of puja.

145
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:44,630
First we'll do the havana and then the puja, will be better.

146
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:55,190
Because by that we'll evoke the fire element,

147
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:06,430
which burns away all the evils.

148
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:14,630
When you wash My feet, you do the same thing.

149
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:23,070
And even when you evoke the fire, you do the same thing.

150
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:28,470
So today first we'll have the havana

151
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:32,270
and then we'll have the puja.

152
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:39,470
Both are just the same.

153
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:45,270
You can worship Me with water or with fire.

154
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:52,790
The essence of fire is the glow, tejas.

155
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:01,990
All that is wrong, all that is evil is burned out,

156
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:11,670
and then the glow shows on the faces and the body of the seekers.

157
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:31,070
And also atmosphere is charged

158
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:35,710
with the beautiful vibrations

159
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:39,430
when you have the havana.

160
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:48,870
So I think best thing will be to do the havan first

161
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:53,470
and then the puja.

162
00:22:57,630 --> 00:23:00,830
May God bless you!

163
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:14,350
First always we have to praise Ganesha before starting the puja,

164
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:19,270
so you start praising Shri Ganesha.

165
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:42,150
Atharva... Atharvashirsha. Ganesha Atharvashirsha.

166
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:45,230
YOGI: Then we'll say [UNCLEAR] in French, so in English [UNCLEAR].

167
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:48,470
All right, say it in French.

168
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:55,270
I'll better to translate it because there are other people.

169
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:58,870
First English and then French.

170
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:04,430
It's all right, I can understand English all right.

171
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:08,630
Is all mantras for Me to understand.

172
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:17,110
Beautiful. [UNCLEAR] beautiful.

173
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:24,430
All right. And now we'll be having the fire. It's all right.

174
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:47,270
Now you put some water in it and [PUT?] it to all the people, now.

175
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:56,070
Today I would say that from France those who came to see Me,

176
00:38:56,270 --> 00:38:59,390
from all these places,

177
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:05,590
one from each center should come forward.

178
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:50,590
These are too big, I think.

179
00:39:54,390 --> 00:40:00,070
You can put the bigger ones to make a triangle first, [UNCLEAR].

180
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:03,510
The bigger ones. Maria?

181
00:40:09,350 --> 00:40:12,550
The triangle on the three sides.

182
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:27,670
One on top of another, this be better.

183
00:40:39,310 --> 00:40:44,510
[UNCLEAR]. Something like a...

184
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:50,230
[UNCLEAR] paper like a... lighter...

185
00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:55,790
Is that the light thing?

186
00:40:56,110 --> 00:40:59,910
And have you got camphor with you?

187
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:07,990
Something lighter, underneath.

188
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:12,230
Do you have anything [UNCLEAR]?

189
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:15,590
Make it smaller [UNCLEAR]. Yes.

190
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:18,830
Put it on top of this thing, not underneath.

191
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:22,390
Not underneath, put it on top. Covering this.

192
00:41:22,590 --> 00:41:26,430
Yes, put the... on top.

193
00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:30,270
Yes, like that, yes, that's right.

194
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:47,830
You have to keep a hole in between.

195
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:53,550
Arrange it in such a way there is a hole in between, in the center.

196
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:58,790
Now arrange on top of this.

197
00:41:58,990 --> 00:42:03,070
No, this is all right. Please cover with this [UNCLEAR].

198
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:28,310
I think there should be a platform first.

199
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:30,510
There should be a platform first — and then.

200
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:33,910
In the center there should be a platform.

201
00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:43,550
Just make a platform there, yes, [UNCLEAR].

202
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:47,310
And also platform... just wait...

203
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:51,150
Markus, on the platform you put another thing.

204
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:55,270
That's better, yeah.

205
00:42:56,790 --> 00:42:59,790
Do you have some more with you?

206
00:43:03,390 --> 00:43:06,390
[UNCLEAR]

207
00:43:09,510 --> 00:43:12,590
To begin with that's sufficient.

208
00:43:57,310 --> 00:43:59,510
You'd like to do 108, [DO YOU?]?

209
00:43:59,710 --> 00:44:03,310
[UNCLEAR] we just can do 108 of the Goddess

210
00:44:03,510 --> 00:44:07,710
and 108 of Shri Visnu, [UNCLEAR] better.

211
00:47:20,630 --> 00:47:25,790
Swa-ha. Swaha is the quality of the... of the fire

212
00:47:25,990 --> 00:47:30,510
which consumes everything. Swa-ha.

213
00:48:00,150 --> 00:48:04,390
Now, after every name that he takes

214
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:07,430
you have to take the thing from your hand like this,

215
00:48:07,630 --> 00:48:12,670
and take it round to the right side and put it in the fire.

216
00:48:12,870 --> 00:48:17,310
But those who haven't got these things in the hand

217
00:48:17,510 --> 00:48:20,390
should take up just their hand like that,

218
00:48:20,590 --> 00:48:22,870
thinking that they have it in their hand,

219
00:48:23,110 --> 00:48:28,150
and moving it upward like that and put it in the fire.

220
00:48:41,270 --> 00:48:44,430
And you all should say "Swaha".

221
00:48:48,870 --> 00:48:53,710
Now, just a minute. After every name, after every name.

222
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:04,230
First the Devi.

223
01:04:39,910 --> 01:04:43,830
Now we'll do the Vishnu Sahasranama, hundred and eight.

224
01:06:15,990 --> 01:06:19,910
As I said, 21 names of Vishnu are sufficient.

225
01:10:07,510 --> 01:10:14,710
Now the... first you [UNCLEAR] this, finish it [INAUDIBLE].

226
01:10:14,910 --> 01:10:18,630
For that you have to use some sort of a fruit.

227
01:10:18,830 --> 01:10:21,350
Raspberry. Do you have something?

228
01:10:21,550 --> 01:10:23,910
What is the special fruit of France?

229
01:10:24,150 --> 01:10:26,790
YOGI: A special fruit of France? Apples!

230
01:10:26,990 --> 01:10:28,510
SHRI MATAJI: Apples, or you should have...

231
01:10:28,710 --> 01:10:32,510
YOGI: Stem berries... cherries, cherries and grape, grape, Mother!

232
01:10:32,710 --> 01:10:35,470
SHRI MATAJI: Grape is the best.

233
01:10:35,670 --> 01:10:39,270
YOGI: [UNCLEAR] just to bless it, Mother.

234
01:11:11,630 --> 01:11:16,470
SHRI MATAJI: So now, this is the ultimate puja we have done now.

235
01:11:16,670 --> 01:11:20,870
This is the end of the puja, is finished, throw all that in that.

236
01:11:21,070 --> 01:11:25,230
All the... all the remaining things are to be thrown.

237
01:11:28,870 --> 01:11:31,870
Yes, put it.

238
01:11:46,390 --> 01:11:51,550
Now, we have put today the grapes in it.

239
01:11:53,350 --> 01:11:58,750
That means the grapes will loose their capacity to ferment.

240
01:12:18,510 --> 01:12:21,510
That's the best.

241
01:12:29,190 --> 01:12:30,710
The wind is blowing!

242
01:12:30,910 --> 01:12:37,750
So [THAT'S HOW?] [UNCLEAR] outside [UNCLEAR].

243
01:12:47,430 --> 01:12:50,910
The main thing was the havan today.

244
01:13:00,350 --> 01:13:02,790
[UNCLEAR] [AND DRESS UP?].

245
01:13:02,990 --> 01:13:05,910
YOGI: Mother, the dinner is not ready... the lunch is not ready.

246
01:13:06,110 --> 01:13:07,150
SHRI MATAJI: Not ready, is it?

247
01:13:07,350 --> 01:13:10,070
YOGI: Not, yes. In one hour, in one hour.

248
01:13:10,270 --> 01:13:13,270
SHRI MATAJI: So, we'll finish the puja?
