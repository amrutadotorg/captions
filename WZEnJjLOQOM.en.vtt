00:00:11.484 --> 00:00:16.484
Yesterday, you had asked me

00:00:17.026 --> 00:00:19.026
for the status of a Guru.

00:00:21.645 --> 00:00:24.948
It's a state,

00:00:26.338 --> 00:00:29.564
it is not a status because status

00:00:30.615 --> 00:00:33.610
is external, can be bestowed upon anyone,

00:00:35.127 --> 00:00:40.335
and anybody can say that this is your status.

00:00:43.038 --> 00:00:45.742
For something external merit, or something,

00:00:46.793 --> 00:00:48.396
you can give a status to a person. 

00:00:49.277 --> 00:00:50.391
It is a state.

00:00:51.357 --> 00:00:53.978
State means the innate being,

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.514
evolved to that level

00:01:00.137 --> 00:01:04.306
that you become the master.

00:01:07.836 --> 00:01:08.713
Of course

00:01:12.688 --> 00:01:16.776
you have to be your own master to begin with, no doubt about it.

00:01:18.335 --> 00:01:20.760
If you are not even your own master

00:01:22.044 --> 00:01:23.765
then how you can

00:01:26.234 --> 00:01:27.481
achieve that state.

00:01:30.417 --> 00:01:32.417
Now as I say it is innate.

00:01:34.082 --> 00:01:36.253
Then one starts thinking

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:39.515
if it is innate in a Sahaj way

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:41.880
how do we achieve it.

00:01:51.498 --> 00:01:53.498
There are certain faculties,

00:01:54.989 --> 00:01:57.406
which we have to develop to begin with.

00:02:01.672 --> 00:02:03.672
The first faculty is

00:02:07.596 --> 00:02:09.596
if you can become thoughtless.

00:02:12.997 --> 00:02:14.468
In meditation

00:02:15.292 --> 00:02:17.292
you can become thoughtless

00:02:17.792 --> 00:02:18.623
for a short time.

00:02:20.618 --> 00:02:22.618
Gradually this short time

00:02:24.001 --> 00:02:25.619
should go on increasing,

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:28.119
that you are without any thought.

00:02:32.114 --> 00:02:34.773
This happens also as we can say is a state,

00:02:38.354 --> 00:02:41.640
but how do we achieve that, again,

00:02:42.338 --> 00:02:44.721
because human beings cannot understand

00:02:45.221 --> 00:02:47.550
that anything can happen spontaneously

00:02:47.582 --> 00:02:50.589
it has to be done somehow, something has to be done.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.092
For that in Sahaj

00:02:56.547 --> 00:02:59.083
we have something very very simple,

00:03:03.475 --> 00:03:08.261
that you have got a mantra as Nirvichara.

00:03:11.356 --> 00:03:13.627
So now you watch anything 

00:03:14.902 --> 00:03:15.997
saying the mantra

00:03:17.578 --> 00:03:19.632
Om twameva sakshat Nirvichara

00:03:21.862 --> 00:03:24.635
Then you'll start seeing that,

00:03:24.937 --> 00:03:25.901
witnessing that

00:03:27.842 --> 00:03:29.842
without thinking.

00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:34.603
Just see, witness.

00:03:38.815 --> 00:03:40.815
Just seeing itself

00:03:42.847 --> 00:03:46.518
creates that state within us the first state, is very important

00:03:47.468 --> 00:03:49.936
that you become the witness, the 'Sakshi'.

00:03:56.634 --> 00:03:59.900
As soon as you become the Sakshi,

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.310
the whole thing whatever you are seeing

00:04:11.278 --> 00:04:14.389
gives you a complete idea,

00:04:15.646 --> 00:04:19.052
subtle as well as gross of that thing.

00:04:20.111 --> 00:04:23.633
You see it and you know it

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:27.900
and as a Sahaja yogi

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.400
it becomes your knowledge.

00:04:31.693 --> 00:04:33.693
We can say in the modern terminology

00:04:35.761 --> 00:04:37.761
that you see something,

00:04:39.756 --> 00:04:42.176
it gets recorded in your mind

00:04:44.388 --> 00:04:46.388
and it manifests joy,

00:04:48.654 --> 00:04:50.654
it manifests knowledge,

00:04:53.064 --> 00:04:56.540
it manifests compassion, whatever may the situation,

00:04:58.986 --> 00:05:01.441
because now you have many dimensions

00:05:03.364 --> 00:05:04.411
which you have to develop,

00:05:05.902 --> 00:05:07.902
these dimensions are to be developed.

00:05:09.645 --> 00:05:11.645
Now supposing you go and meet someone

00:05:13.082 --> 00:05:14.195
with whom you have to deal.

00:05:17.975 --> 00:05:19.975
He's talking, talking, talking,

00:05:21.448 --> 00:05:23.448
just become thoughtless.

00:05:24.867 --> 00:05:28.131
So know what is the thing that will happen as soon as you become thoughtless.

00:05:28.631 --> 00:05:30.631
First his thoughts,

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:32.789
his bombardment will not touch you

00:05:33.055 --> 00:05:35.365
because you are in a different realm altogether.

00:05:36.388 --> 00:05:38.388
But in that realm

00:05:42.185 --> 00:05:44.185
your power will manifest.

00:05:45.262 --> 00:05:47.262
It may cool him down,

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:50.050
it will shut him down

00:05:51.307 --> 00:05:53.307
or maybe he may just

00:05:53.807 --> 00:05:56.454
feel tremendous love for you.

00:06:04.702 --> 00:06:07.855
So the word Guru means Gravity.

00:06:10.661 --> 00:06:12.661
That the Mother Earth has gravity.

00:06:14.566 --> 00:06:17.805
In the same a person who is a Guru

00:06:18.197 --> 00:06:20.654
has to have the gravity.

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:23.550
But how do you develop this gravity.

00:06:25.257 --> 00:06:27.257
Some people just

00:06:27.307 --> 00:06:29.307
artificially become very grave

00:06:30.924 --> 00:06:32.136
and sometimes

00:06:32.726 --> 00:06:35.273
show that they are very serious or something like that.

00:06:38.169 --> 00:06:40.169
Gravity is within yourself.

00:06:43.011 --> 00:06:45.011
In the second state, we should say,

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:50.827
of guru Pada is your gravity must manifest.

00:06:51.994 --> 00:06:53.994
As you become the witness

00:06:54.296 --> 00:06:56.825
your gravity starts expressing itself.

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:01.786
It will not show as temper

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:04.328
or seriousness or anything like that.

00:07:05.116 --> 00:07:08.652
But it will manifest in a way that

00:07:11.963 --> 00:07:15.234
the whole thing will become extremely dignified

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:17.076
and majestic.

00:07:17.576 --> 00:07:19.576
It will just manifest by itself.

00:07:21.463 --> 00:07:25.645
So the state in which you rise,

00:07:27.028 --> 00:07:29.028
now becomes effective.

00:07:31.078 --> 00:07:33.078
Before this it was not.

00:07:34.209 --> 00:07:36.209
You had to all the time

00:07:38.096 --> 00:07:40.619
manipulate, say this, say that.

00:07:42.741 --> 00:07:44.741
But in your silence

00:07:45.421 --> 00:07:48.888
you can manifest your gravity,

00:07:50.595 --> 00:07:53.549
and this gravity is extremely...

00:07:55.403 --> 00:07:57.403
it acts like a magnet.

00:07:58.769 --> 00:08:00.769
As you know there is a magnet in the Mother Earth.

00:08:02.388 --> 00:08:06.359
That we call as the gravity by which people are attracted.

00:08:07.996 --> 00:08:10.426
We are resting on this Mother Earth

00:08:10.511 --> 00:08:11.985
because of her gravity.

00:08:14.022 --> 00:08:16.670
Everything is attracted to Mother Earth

00:08:16.827 --> 00:08:18.611
because of her gravity.

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:23.988
So you get a magnetic temperament, magnetic

00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:26.807
character,

00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:30.437
magnetic personality.

00:08:32.092 --> 00:08:34.092
And this magnetic personality

00:08:35.693 --> 00:08:36.682
that you develop,

00:08:38.193 --> 00:08:43.124
immediately shows that it is manifesting its power,

00:08:43.985 --> 00:08:45.104
try to understand.

00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:49.228
Like the light now is coming on me

00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:51.353
it is just giving light,

00:08:51.979 --> 00:08:53.979
but it is not manifesting anything.

00:08:56.410 --> 00:08:59.150
We can see the sun's rays, is the best example.

00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:04.471
Sun's rays when they fall onto the leaves,

00:09:06.776 --> 00:09:08.776
the rays, which look simple,

00:09:09.276 --> 00:09:14.032
manifest their power of making it into chlorophyll.

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:18.393
In the same way when you are

00:09:19.074 --> 00:09:21.074
at that height

00:09:21.484 --> 00:09:23.952
or at that state then

00:09:24.452 --> 00:09:25.904
without saying anything,

00:09:27.144 --> 00:09:29.144
without doing anything, even a glance,

00:09:33.489 --> 00:09:38.319
you manifest but not only that, but you record everything.

00:09:42.104 --> 00:09:44.104
So many people must have noticed

00:09:45.922 --> 00:09:47.922
that I seldom forget things.

00:09:48.873 --> 00:09:50.873
Like once I was travelling

00:09:52.239 --> 00:09:56.629
and I saw some red stones near Sangamne,

00:09:57.977 --> 00:10:01.601
and when I said that why not we have some red stones for Pratishtan.

00:10:02.408 --> 00:10:05.274
They said "but there are no red stones in the whole of Maharastra."

00:10:05.305 --> 00:10:07.305
I said "there are". "Where?",

00:10:07.805 --> 00:10:11.941
I said "go on the way you'll find them near Sangamne.",

00:10:12.712 --> 00:10:15.341
they said "we have travelled so much, we have never seen.",

00:10:15.949 --> 00:10:17.949
I said "I don't know what you are seeing you know,

00:10:19.063 --> 00:10:21.503
what you are watching, I have definitely seen."

00:10:22.003 --> 00:10:25.740
When they went there they saw mountains and mountains of these red stones

00:10:26.619 --> 00:10:28.619
and they never noticed it even.

00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:34.353
So now

00:10:36.658 --> 00:10:39.836
when you start witnessing something without thought

00:10:41.726 --> 00:10:44.033
there is no obstruction for absorbing

00:10:44.533 --> 00:10:46.533
the knowledge about that thing,

00:10:47.033 --> 00:10:48.109
because there is no thought.

00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:52.540
It's complete absorption takes place.

00:10:54.394 --> 00:10:56.394
And then it manifests.

00:11:00.739 --> 00:11:02.739
This is how

00:11:05.568 --> 00:11:07.930
the divine power works within us.

00:11:15.759 --> 00:11:18.120
So with our gravity

00:11:20.642 --> 00:11:25.059
what we do is to touch that depth within us,

00:11:25.559 --> 00:11:28.909
which can carry the divine power and manifest.

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:33.163
Unless and until we touch that depth within us

00:11:34.331 --> 00:11:36.331
Sahaja yoga is like

00:11:38.383 --> 00:11:39.449
Hare Rama Hare Krishna.

00:11:43.433 --> 00:11:45.433
Nothing better than that

00:11:45.933 --> 00:11:47.933
and that's why I find so many Sahaja yogis

00:11:48.902 --> 00:11:54.757
sometimes really go off their rails suddenly.

00:11:56.051 --> 00:11:58.051
Because they have no gravity

00:11:59.291 --> 00:12:01.783
to go down into their own being

00:12:02.554 --> 00:12:05.761
and to feel the beauty and the glory of their own being

00:12:06.784 --> 00:12:08.784
and to use that gravity

00:12:10.764 --> 00:12:13.529
for manifesting divine power.

00:12:18.569 --> 00:12:19.778
We could say that

00:12:21.214 --> 00:12:24.622
supposing there is a vehicle, which is very weak,

00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:29.540
which is not yet properly fixed,

00:12:31.491 --> 00:12:36.157
can not be used for something substantial.

00:12:38.841 --> 00:12:44.052
And the most substantial thing in your lives is this divine power,

00:12:44.911 --> 00:12:48.277
which looks very light;

00:12:49.557 --> 00:12:51.557
you never feel the weight of this divine power.

00:12:53.523 --> 00:12:56.309
You'll never feel the pressure of this divine power

00:13:00.272 --> 00:13:02.602
but if you are not clean,

00:13:04.678 --> 00:13:06.834
if your channel is not clean

00:13:07.771 --> 00:13:10.827
then this divine power cannot flow properly,

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:12.616
it cannot manifest.

00:13:13.849 --> 00:13:17.963
So when we say that we are the instruments of God Almighty

00:13:18.463 --> 00:13:20.212
then like this instrument we are,

00:13:20.712 --> 00:13:22.307
now we are connected to the mains.

00:13:22.604 --> 00:13:25.641
If this instrument is not all right

00:13:25.954 --> 00:13:28.452
than it cannot manifest

00:13:28.952 --> 00:13:30.449
whatever it is supposed to do.

00:13:32.337 --> 00:13:34.337
But we are much above

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:38.677
all these ordinary instruments,

00:13:39.427 --> 00:13:40.900
even the most complicated,

00:13:42.539 --> 00:13:47.252
even the most advanced and developed by science.

00:13:48.329 --> 00:13:50.329
Because we reach a state where

00:13:51.453 --> 00:13:54.497
we ourselves become the science.

00:13:55.824 --> 00:13:58.990
Science of truth, an absolute truth.

00:14:00.832 --> 00:14:06.597
So what is needed for a Guru is self esteem.

00:14:08.688 --> 00:14:12.912
This is a very important point people don't realise, the self-esteem.

00:14:16.267 --> 00:14:18.267
To achieve the self-esteem

00:14:18.767 --> 00:14:20.325
we have to introspect

00:14:21.184 --> 00:14:23.433
and know that today

00:14:23.574 --> 00:14:26.477
I am not what I was before.

00:14:27.975 --> 00:14:29.099
I am a realised soul,

00:14:30.847 --> 00:14:34.317
I have got powers. Of course I have powers.

00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:37.770
Powers of love, powers of compassion,

00:14:38.972 --> 00:14:40.980
powers of grasping things,

00:14:43.945 --> 00:14:45.464
powers of creativity,

00:14:48.491 --> 00:14:52.514
powers of giving realisations to others.

00:14:53.919 --> 00:14:55.296
Nobody had these powers

00:14:57.060 --> 00:15:00.208
but somehow or other in Sahaja Yoga you are not self conscious,

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:03.533
and we should not be self conscious

00:15:03.581 --> 00:15:05.581
because that can give you ego

00:15:06.081 --> 00:15:08.747
but we should have self esteem.

00:15:10.261 --> 00:15:11.026
I am a Guru,

00:15:12.899 --> 00:15:16.714
I am a Guru, I am not an ordinary person.

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:19.093
I am not on the street,

00:15:20.435 --> 00:15:22.435
I am something special

00:15:23.325 --> 00:15:26.905
and on the shores of truth,

00:15:28.169 --> 00:15:30.169
I have to salvage the people

00:15:30.903 --> 00:15:33.628
who are blind, who are mad.

00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:35.808
All kinds of things.

00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:41.173
In the most chaotic conditions this world is today.

00:15:43.108 --> 00:15:46.641
So at that time a kind of a silence

00:15:49.372 --> 00:15:50.405
will come within you.

00:15:51.857 --> 00:15:53.841
When there will be any such crisis,

00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:56.836
immediately you will become extremely silent.

00:15:57.336 --> 00:15:59.336
But this is again a state I am telling you.

00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:02.990
So now, if there is

00:16:03.709 --> 00:16:06.859
something that makes you upset

00:16:09.169 --> 00:16:10.588
or makes you unhappy,

00:16:13.116 --> 00:16:16.080
try to reach that point that axis

00:16:16.908 --> 00:16:18.908
which is just silence,

00:16:21.498 --> 00:16:24.755
and this silence will make you really powerful

00:16:25.255 --> 00:16:28.077
because this silence is not only yours.

00:16:29.903 --> 00:16:33.915
When you are in that silence you are in the silence of the cosmos,

00:16:35.959 --> 00:16:37.385
silence of the cosmos.

00:16:38.462 --> 00:16:40.462
And the silence of the cosmos

00:16:43.708 --> 00:16:44.553
works for you.

00:16:46.379 --> 00:16:47.582
You are in connection

00:16:52.778 --> 00:16:53.549
with that

00:16:54.579 --> 00:16:58.494
cosmic power we can call it but it's more than that it is divine power I should say.

00:17:00.195 --> 00:17:02.858
Divine power, which is working all the cosmos.

00:17:07.648 --> 00:17:08.438
So if you

00:17:12.604 --> 00:17:13.010
just

00:17:14.789 --> 00:17:16.631
become silent within yourself,

00:17:17.505 --> 00:17:20.896
know that you are sitting in the kingdom of God.

00:17:26.373 --> 00:17:27.224
It's like this,

00:17:29.752 --> 00:17:32.722
when say you

00:17:33.674 --> 00:17:37.503
get the great honour

00:17:40.047 --> 00:17:42.505
of becoming a King

00:17:44.939 --> 00:17:47.460
then you walk up to a throne

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:49.974
and you sit down

00:17:51.644 --> 00:17:52.621
and look around

00:17:54.603 --> 00:17:57.325
and you feel the silence

00:18:00.243 --> 00:18:05.263
of the state that now you are the King.

00:18:07.994 --> 00:18:08.951
This silence

00:18:10.465 --> 00:18:13.073
is the sign that you are definitely,

00:18:13.901 --> 00:18:17.941
definitely you are now

00:18:19.268 --> 00:18:23.748
in contact with the divine.

00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:28.798
You are silent because the divine is going to look after everything.

00:18:32.481 --> 00:18:34.901
You don't have to do anything, just keep silent.

00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:39.044
But not forcibly, it's again a state.

00:18:41.962 --> 00:18:45.425
See if any turmoil takes place, any problem takes place

00:18:46.767 --> 00:18:49.763
suddenly your attention will jump on to that silence

00:18:52.322 --> 00:18:54.834
and once you jump onto that silence

00:18:56.254 --> 00:19:00.031
you being in contact with this whole all pervading power.

00:19:00.656 --> 00:19:02.656
And when I talk about all pervading power

00:19:03.234 --> 00:19:05.234
we still don't understand what it is.

00:19:06.951 --> 00:19:10.481
What it means this all pervading power of love.

00:19:10.529 --> 00:19:13.693
Is it some sort of an energy floating around

00:19:14.583 --> 00:19:19.521
or is it some sort of a river

00:19:21.144 --> 00:19:24.141
or some sort of a ether.

00:19:29.181 --> 00:19:29.814
It is

00:19:34.089 --> 00:19:38.275
the complete, the totality of reality.

00:19:41.021 --> 00:19:43.664
Complete totality of reality,

00:19:45.084 --> 00:19:47.084
is this all pervading power.

00:19:48.738 --> 00:19:50.738
Other things are unreal.

00:19:55.419 --> 00:19:58.489
And the reality is so efficient.

00:20:10.814 --> 00:20:12.814
It is so efficient;

00:20:12.846 --> 00:20:14.846
it never fails, like this mike.

00:20:23.225 --> 00:20:25.225
It's such a tremendous;

00:20:27.987 --> 00:20:31.293
you can call the intertwined process,

00:20:34.055 --> 00:20:36.055
which we cannot even

00:20:38.692 --> 00:20:41.366
imagine with this human understanding.

00:20:45.251 --> 00:20:47.472
How it controls, how it works.

00:20:50.765 --> 00:20:52.765
Say for example

00:20:53.889 --> 00:20:54.847
you see the trees.

00:20:56.860 --> 00:21:01.085
Rosebush will give rose only it won't give apples.

00:21:02.958 --> 00:21:05.496
It will grow up to a certain height it won't grow

00:21:05.996 --> 00:21:07.463
like a coconut tree.

00:21:09.804 --> 00:21:12.457
All the characters of this

00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:21.103
nature is maintained, nourished, looked after,

00:21:21.899 --> 00:21:24.720
controlled absolutely at the right time,

00:21:26.718 --> 00:21:27.454
at the right

00:21:30.232 --> 00:21:34.305
seasons that's why in Sanskrit this is called as ritambara pragya.

00:21:34.805 --> 00:21:36.805
Roota means seasons

00:21:37.742 --> 00:21:41.203
and the one which looks after these seasons.

00:21:42.109 --> 00:21:44.266
That knowledge which is enlightened,

00:21:44.953 --> 00:21:46.953
a simple definition.

00:21:48.701 --> 00:21:51.844
But still it doesn't explain

00:21:53.186 --> 00:21:55.186
because it is so

00:21:57.605 --> 00:21:59.605
complicated for human brain

00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:03.540
that they cannot understand how it works.

00:22:05.912 --> 00:22:08.304
       Now all the miracles you have described I have seen,

00:22:09.865 --> 00:22:12.503
I mean there are so many still to be recorded.

00:22:15.936 --> 00:22:17.936
It's just a play

00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:21.457
of this power which thinks,

00:22:21.551 --> 00:22:23.551
understands, co-operates,

00:22:24.457 --> 00:22:26.457
coordinates and loves

00:22:30.670 --> 00:22:35.253
and looks after you, is at your disposal,

00:22:35.753 --> 00:22:37.753
at your disposal.

00:22:38.939 --> 00:22:42.264
Wherever you go the connection is maintained.

00:22:43.528 --> 00:22:45.866
It's like a governor

00:22:45.867 --> 00:22:49.716
travelling you see the security travels with him. So they are all around.

00:22:52.228 --> 00:22:53.375
Not only with me

00:22:55.607 --> 00:22:56.397
but with you also.

00:22:59.284 --> 00:23:02.964
You are already booked there.

00:23:05.024 --> 00:23:07.306
And they know you are the one they have to look after.

00:23:08.929 --> 00:23:10.929
They won't look after anybody else.

00:23:12.427 --> 00:23:14.838
They won't do anything for anybody else.

00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:18.361
But for you people, now try to understand the self esteem part,

00:23:18.861 --> 00:23:21.715
you are Sahaja yogis, means you are such special people

00:23:22.933 --> 00:23:24.933
that this divine power

00:23:26.478 --> 00:23:30.032
wherever you may be, whether you are sleeping, you are walking, or

00:23:30.173 --> 00:23:32.503
you are sitting under the tree

00:23:32.519 --> 00:23:35.770
or in your house wherever you are

00:23:36.270 --> 00:23:38.017
that connection is maintained.

00:23:38.673 --> 00:23:40.673
Like a walkie-talkie you can call it at the most.

00:23:42.998 --> 00:23:46.143
Where you don't have to talk, you don't have to say anything

00:23:46.222 --> 00:23:47.799
you don't have to command,

00:23:47.956 --> 00:23:51.442
you don't have to request nothing.

00:23:51.456 --> 00:23:53.942
It is at your disposal.

00:23:57.921 --> 00:24:01.432
Because already you are one of the governors

00:24:01.932 --> 00:24:03.052
in the realm of God.

00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:06.028
So all the protocol that is yours.

00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:08.060
Anybody who tries to insult you or trouble you

00:24:09.543 --> 00:24:12.721
has to pay for that kind of an action.

00:24:13.751 --> 00:24:15.751
So you should never worry.

00:24:15.924 --> 00:24:17.924
You should never think of those things

00:24:18.065 --> 00:24:19.113
on the mundane level.

00:24:20.799 --> 00:24:22.799
On the contrary I would say better forgive

00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:25.580
because God knows what will happen to that person

00:24:26.922 --> 00:24:27.781
who misbehaves.

00:24:28.546 --> 00:24:31.808
It is not only compassion

00:24:32.308 --> 00:24:34.480
also it is wrathful,

00:24:37.117 --> 00:24:38.156
it is wrathful.

00:24:40.388 --> 00:24:42.388
You are special people,

00:24:44.074 --> 00:24:47.672
only thing you have to have your self esteem

00:24:49.108 --> 00:24:51.674
and you must try to maintain

00:24:54.093 --> 00:24:56.547
your balance.

00:24:59.590 --> 00:25:01.590
Once you come in balance

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:05.143
the job of a Guru is to give balance to others.

00:25:05.643 --> 00:25:07.643
It balances everything.

00:25:08.143 --> 00:25:10.827
It will balance the nature, climate,

00:25:11.046 --> 00:25:14.510
atmosphere, society, human beings.

00:25:14.838 --> 00:25:16.838
It is there to balance you,

00:25:21.909 --> 00:25:23.118
and that balance

00:25:24.211 --> 00:25:26.834
comes from the Guru principle, which balances you.

00:25:27.896 --> 00:25:30.430
If you have Guru principle in you,

00:25:30.493 --> 00:25:32.493
you get into balance, automatically.

00:25:35.754 --> 00:25:38.051
Automatically you become a balanced personality.

00:25:39.113 --> 00:25:42.090
Nobody has to tell you now you balance. You are balanced.

00:25:45.211 --> 00:25:47.589
So now how do we develop that balance?

00:25:54.002 --> 00:25:56.330
Of course in the ancient times

00:25:57.158 --> 00:25:59.748
they had very severe methods;

00:26:00.716 --> 00:26:02.716
is not to eat much,

00:26:04.292 --> 00:26:08.127
to starve yourself and go to Himalayas, stand on your heads

00:26:08.221 --> 00:26:09.076
and do all kinds of things.

00:26:10.450 --> 00:26:13.903
This will bring great imbalance.

00:26:15.745 --> 00:26:17.745
If you become an austere personality

00:26:18.526 --> 00:26:21.518
it will make you such a dry person

00:26:22.377 --> 00:26:25.105
that nobody would like to stand near you, I mean

00:26:25.106 --> 00:26:26.540
you'll be burning absolutely.

00:26:28.974 --> 00:26:30.392
So the ascetic ideas,

00:26:30.627 --> 00:26:33.662
I don't know from where it has come whatever it has come,

00:26:34.568 --> 00:26:35.845
maybe because

00:26:36.345 --> 00:26:39.461
they wanted people to pay more attention to their spirit,

00:26:42.488 --> 00:26:43.494
but a Guru

00:26:45.928 --> 00:26:47.692
is not ascetic by nature

00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:52.732
but he is so detached that he's ascetic.

00:26:54.355 --> 00:26:57.762
He may be the King or he may be a beggar

00:26:59.089 --> 00:27:02.778
or he may be a big personality somewhere

00:27:03.278 --> 00:27:06.227
or he may be just an ordinary person,

00:27:07.211 --> 00:27:09.211
if he is a Guru

00:27:10.569 --> 00:27:12.569
then in every state

00:27:13.553 --> 00:27:15.553
he is in complete balance.

00:27:19.454 --> 00:27:21.078
Nothing can disturb him.

00:27:22.389 --> 00:27:23.102
Supposing

00:27:25.396 --> 00:27:28.248
you put a crown on his head. So what.

00:27:30.183 --> 00:27:33.671
Whether it is a cardboard crown,

00:27:34.477 --> 00:27:38.552
silver or gold or diamonds or anything,

00:27:39.270 --> 00:27:40.156
it can never

00:27:41.904 --> 00:27:45.458
impress him and he can never go into imbalances.

00:27:56.940 --> 00:28:01.636
Food for example. Food is one of the weak points I think.

00:28:04.554 --> 00:28:08.127
A Guru who might eat quite a lot,

00:28:09.142 --> 00:28:11.142
may not eat at all,

00:28:14.232 --> 00:28:16.987
may like something to eat,

00:28:17.393 --> 00:28:19.393
something not to eat, whatever it is,

00:28:22.186 --> 00:28:26.905
but nothing can dominate this Guru.

00:28:29.495 --> 00:28:31.495
So the symptom

00:28:32.510 --> 00:28:34.897
is that you are in balance

00:28:36.629 --> 00:28:40.638
and you cannot be dominated by food

00:28:40.888 --> 00:28:45.722
or by power or by wealth or money or anything.

00:28:45.738 --> 00:28:47.093
Nothing can dominate you.

00:28:50.916 --> 00:28:52.916
You are above all these things.

00:28:55.553 --> 00:28:59.185
And once you know that you are above these things

00:29:02.883 --> 00:29:04.283
then you are not afraid.

00:29:06.015 --> 00:29:09.401
No more you are afraid. Fearlessness comes into you.

00:29:10.821 --> 00:29:12.821
Become absolutely fearless.

00:29:16.472 --> 00:29:22.041
Nothing can, nothing can put you into imbalance.

00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:25.820
Nothing can dominate you.

00:29:26.944 --> 00:29:28.944
Nothing can weaken you.

00:29:30.536 --> 00:29:32.536
Nothing can make you an addict.

00:29:35.438 --> 00:29:37.438
Nothing is tempting.

00:29:41.776 --> 00:29:45.049
There's nothing like temptation left anymore.

00:29:49.059 --> 00:29:52.469
When you reach that state, beyond temptation,

00:29:54.701 --> 00:29:57.376
beyond any greed, beyond any lust,

00:30:01.230 --> 00:30:01.890
then

00:30:06.384 --> 00:30:07.526
there is no

00:30:11.349 --> 00:30:16.116
problem, nothing; nothing can really bring you down.

00:30:20.891 --> 00:30:25.451
You may wear ordinary tulsi

00:30:25.951 --> 00:30:28.659
garland or you may wear

00:30:33.465 --> 00:30:35.465
pearls or diamonds or anything.

00:30:39.272 --> 00:30:41.272
That doesn't touch you,

00:30:42.755 --> 00:30:44.755
but you don't run away from anything

00:30:46.394 --> 00:30:50.359
because when you run away from something you become an ascetic artificially.

00:30:50.859 --> 00:30:53.713
Asceticism is within yourself, innate.

00:30:57.037 --> 00:31:00.467
So nothing can hamper you, nothing can matter.

00:31:06.614 --> 00:31:11.820
That state we have to see, but mostly what happens with people,

00:31:13.506 --> 00:31:16.059
they'll say Mother I don't think I'm a Guru. I said why?

00:31:17.479 --> 00:31:19.984
Because of what symptom you told me

00:31:20.234 --> 00:31:23.103
all they are there. I still want to eat this food,

00:31:23.759 --> 00:31:24.881
I still this thing.

00:31:25.381 --> 00:31:27.381
You are going the other way round.

00:31:30.814 --> 00:31:31.729
You shouldn't try

00:31:32.588 --> 00:31:37.094
to weigh upon what I am telling you or try to judge yourself.

00:31:37.204 --> 00:31:38.301
Don't judge.

00:31:40.267 --> 00:31:43.686
You just gradually rise, appreciate yourself.

00:31:46.510 --> 00:31:50.788
And gradually you rise and settle down

00:31:53.191 --> 00:31:54.695
on the position that you have achieved.

00:31:56.084 --> 00:32:00.677
Instead of that you'll feel very defiant

00:32:01.645 --> 00:32:04.997
and you will feel very much depressed

00:32:05.497 --> 00:32:09.080
if you start judging "Oh Mother has said that we must have this,

00:32:09.580 --> 00:32:11.627
Mother has said we must have this".

00:32:15.122 --> 00:32:19.351
If you all the time start judging yourself,

00:32:19.851 --> 00:32:20.816
this will not help you.

00:32:22.938 --> 00:32:24.270
You are self-assured.

00:32:27.172 --> 00:32:28.422
You are sure about yourself.

00:32:30.373 --> 00:32:31.857
There is nothing to judge,

00:32:33.979 --> 00:32:36.340
yourself or tall it.

00:32:37.058 --> 00:32:41.021
Sometimes I see some people go on saying "Mother said so".

00:32:43.845 --> 00:32:47.524
I might have said, might not have said, out of reference, whatever it is.

00:32:49.038 --> 00:32:52.104
What is it I have said so. What are YOU saying?

00:32:57.269 --> 00:32:58.846
Because this is a very good way

00:32:59.252 --> 00:33:01.252
of troubling others "Mother said so".

00:33:02.034 --> 00:33:03.070
"What did she say?"

00:33:04.291 --> 00:33:08.427
"That you should not take your food every day".

00:33:08.927 --> 00:33:10.046
I never said it.

00:33:11.816 --> 00:33:14.418
But somebody can start something like that, stupid.

00:33:16.689 --> 00:33:19.625
Supposing even if I have said it. It doesn't matter. What do you have to say?

00:33:21.301 --> 00:33:23.301
So you even out vow

00:33:27.296 --> 00:33:29.657
into your own experience what is good.

00:33:30.690 --> 00:33:34.657
You wouldn't believe that as a human being I am useless.

00:33:36.019 --> 00:33:38.019
Really it was very difficult. 

00:33:38.519 --> 00:33:41.536
Actually my father used to tell me so many things about human beings.

00:33:41.597 --> 00:33:45.136
What sort of things they are and how I should appear.

00:33:45.997 --> 00:33:48.836
It is very difficult to be a human being. Very, very difficult.

00:33:51.217 --> 00:33:53.707
First I didn't know why the reactions are like this.

00:33:53.941 --> 00:33:56.572
Why people behave like this and what to do with them.

00:33:56.900 --> 00:33:59.806
How to mange them. It's quite difficult.

00:34:01.748 --> 00:34:04.616
You can say even William Blake had the same problem.

00:34:06.966 --> 00:34:09.658
But when you reach that state

00:34:13.841 --> 00:34:18.260
then you just enjoy yourself.

00:34:21.716 --> 00:34:25.064
For you, you have a greater enjoyment than mine

00:34:28.558 --> 00:34:32.200
because you are already human beings,

00:34:34.158 --> 00:34:35.669
so you know about human beings.

00:34:38.113 --> 00:34:40.113
And then you see your ascent

00:34:42.682 --> 00:34:45.620
and is much easier for you to appreciate.

00:34:48.361 --> 00:34:50.864
For me it is, I don't know,

00:34:51.474 --> 00:34:53.400
because I have never known temptations,

00:34:53.414 --> 00:34:55.748
I've never known all these qualities that you had.

00:34:57.032 --> 00:34:58.422
So I don't know how to judge

00:35:01.195 --> 00:35:03.195
what is coming out of it, you see.

00:35:05.780 --> 00:35:09.037
If you don't have any problems.

00:35:10.619 --> 00:35:12.839
If you never had any, say

00:35:15.032 --> 00:35:15.839
temptations,

00:35:19.599 --> 00:35:21.866
as you were you are, what is so great.

00:35:23.385 --> 00:35:26.714
But from something human you have come

00:35:27.214 --> 00:35:29.214
to a higher level,

00:35:30.952 --> 00:35:34.198
is very creditable, and you can enjoy much more

00:35:35.545 --> 00:35:38.145
than I could enjoy or

00:35:38.645 --> 00:35:42.518
Christ could enjoy or Sri Krishna could enjoy.

00:35:48.661 --> 00:35:50.661
Because the one who has

00:35:53.199 --> 00:35:55.199
risen, has grown

00:35:56.514 --> 00:36:01.292
now feels the fragrance of his virtues and qualities and greatness.

00:36:03.183 --> 00:36:04.452
Then he enjoys himself.

00:36:07.272 --> 00:36:10.214
So what. I am sitting here he'll say,

00:36:10.636 --> 00:36:13.471
"all right, I am sitting here,

00:36:15.272 --> 00:36:18.269
why are you bothered, I am all right."

00:36:23.863 --> 00:36:24.678
To him

00:36:27.075 --> 00:36:28.636
a proper understanding

00:36:31.989 --> 00:36:33.989
of this change 

00:36:35.853 --> 00:36:36.199
comes

00:36:39.223 --> 00:36:41.779
and he understands other human beings

00:36:42.436 --> 00:36:45.082
much better who don't have

00:36:47.322 --> 00:36:49.322
your capacity, your knowledge,

00:36:49.634 --> 00:36:51.322
your depth, your gravity.

00:36:52.041 --> 00:36:54.041
Because you have been a human being,

00:36:55.137 --> 00:36:56.064
now you are divine.

00:36:56.815 --> 00:36:58.815
Because you have been a human being

00:36:59.817 --> 00:37:00.752
you understand 

00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:03.937
other people.

00:37:06.067 --> 00:37:08.067
So a Guru like me,

00:37:11.435 --> 00:37:12.185
I don't know,

00:37:17.575 --> 00:37:21.091
It's a very different situation here because I am a Mother,

00:37:23.644 --> 00:37:25.989
and I have seen these Gurus, the real Gurus.

00:37:27.523 --> 00:37:30.015
They are very harsh people I must say.

00:37:31.518 --> 00:37:35.341
I couldn't understand how they beat people, how they thrash them,

00:37:35.998 --> 00:37:38.170
how they hang them on the well,

00:37:38.670 --> 00:37:41.839
do all kinds of things. I couldn't understand why do they do it.

00:37:44.063 --> 00:37:46.375
But they have come out from the human level,

00:37:47.439 --> 00:37:49.013
from struggles and fights,

00:37:50.030 --> 00:37:52.788
so they think that why should others get it so easily

00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:55.366
why not they also have the problem.

00:37:56.556 --> 00:37:59.312
You didn't get it on to all these problems.

00:37:59.765 --> 00:38:01.562
You are different from those gurus.

00:38:02.987 --> 00:38:04.138
You got it Sahaj,

00:38:06.519 --> 00:38:09.320
in a very simple manner. You didn't do anything.

00:38:09.475 --> 00:38:12.031
Sahaj you got it. Absolutely Sahaj.

00:38:13.142 --> 00:38:14.782
You didn't do anything about it.

00:38:17.492 --> 00:38:20.103
So your role as a guru

00:38:21.246 --> 00:38:23.125
is different from those gurus

00:38:23.170 --> 00:38:26.427
who struggled so much to become a evolved soul.

00:38:29.153 --> 00:38:31.153
So your attitude towards things

00:38:33.299 --> 00:38:36.696
has to be more compassionate,

00:38:37.196 --> 00:38:41.356
more understanding, more loving.

00:38:42.217 --> 00:38:45.072
As you got it Sahaj others can also get it from you.

00:38:46.591 --> 00:38:48.591
Don't have to do something horrible,

00:38:49.530 --> 00:38:50.960
don't have to shout at them.

00:38:52.056 --> 00:38:55.181
Some people who met me told me, which is very sad,

00:38:55.994 --> 00:38:58.724
that some Sahaja yogis said something harsh to them

00:38:58.973 --> 00:39:00.160
so they had to leave Sahaja Yoga.

00:39:02.024 --> 00:39:04.911
But Sahaja yogis should never say anything harsh to anyone.

00:39:05.411 --> 00:39:06.593
They have no right to say.

00:39:09.695 --> 00:39:14.213
Because without saying anything to you, you got you realisation, absolutely free.

00:39:15.309 --> 00:39:18.051
Without doing anything you got your realisation.

00:39:18.755 --> 00:39:21.476
And if somebody is coming to you for realisation

00:39:21.629 --> 00:39:23.773
you must do it in the same manner.

00:39:25.668 --> 00:39:29.401
You didn't get it through some sort of austere,

00:39:31.939 --> 00:39:35.546
austere, you can say, training.

00:39:37.676 --> 00:39:39.676
So this attitude must be changed.

00:39:40.646 --> 00:39:44.109
And I have seen that if you have this attitude

00:39:44.609 --> 00:39:46.609
then you could be a guru but not Sahaj. 

00:39:50.197 --> 00:39:51.569
So now try to understand

00:39:51.944 --> 00:39:54.579
that there is a difference between a Sahaja Guru

00:39:56.239 --> 00:39:57.472
and a non Sahaj Guru.

00:40:00.448 --> 00:40:02.448
They are very hot tempered, fanatic.

00:40:04.688 --> 00:40:08.968
And a Sahaj Guru has no business to be hot tempered.

00:40:15.706 --> 00:40:18.944
Everything so nice, so beautiful,

00:40:20.306 --> 00:40:26.079
we have all enjoying this beautiful atmosphere.

00:40:26.940 --> 00:40:30.908
Such love, such compassion, such respect for each other.

00:40:32.395 --> 00:40:35.027
No competition, no politics.

00:40:39.524 --> 00:40:43.943
Just if you understand one thing that you have got everything in Sahaj manner

00:40:44.835 --> 00:40:47.630
and in the same Sahaj manner you can give it to others

00:40:48.945 --> 00:40:50.945
and you'll respect others the same manner.

00:40:52.370 --> 00:40:55.858
I think you will be able to.

00:40:56.201 --> 00:40:58.028
There is a gentleman who's taking photographs,

00:40:58.073 --> 00:41:01.196
see who he is, he is not supposed to take photographs of all these things.

00:41:08.796 --> 00:41:10.374
Without permission he should not take.

00:41:19.526 --> 00:41:21.526
/Hindi/

00:41:28.123 --> 00:41:29.368
/Hindi/

00:41:33.144 --> 00:41:35.144
These are mischievous people you know.

00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:52.181
So now we are in a Sahaj style.

00:41:53.464 --> 00:41:56.607
You all know that you got all the powers,

00:41:57.107 --> 00:41:59.107
that you are all gurus,

00:41:59.607 --> 00:42:03.199
that you have achieved so much, you can do so much.

00:42:05.392 --> 00:42:09.253
Then you have to be Sahaj. You got it Sahaj.

00:42:09.518 --> 00:42:12.467
So you have no business to be harsh,

00:42:12.810 --> 00:42:16.312
horrible, hot tempered or strict gurus.

00:42:17.345 --> 00:42:19.823
But it crawls up. I have seen sometimes

00:42:20.323 --> 00:42:23.350
quite a lot of military business starts in Sahaja Yoga also.

00:42:24.414 --> 00:42:28.340
Military sort of treatment, that cannot be.

00:42:30.392 --> 00:42:32.392
No disciplining is needed.

00:42:34.789 --> 00:42:36.431
They'll be disciplined by themselves.

00:42:36.555 --> 00:42:39.354
They are gurus, who can discipline a guru.

00:42:40.356 --> 00:42:41.773
And then they are Sahaj.

00:42:43.543 --> 00:42:46.354
So your style is very different.

00:42:50.004 --> 00:42:51.172
None of these gurus

00:42:51.453 --> 00:42:53.453
knew how to even give realisation.

00:42:53.749 --> 00:42:55.247
I am telling you frankly.

00:42:57.628 --> 00:43:01.816
They never knew that Kundalini can rise with their hands.

00:43:02.661 --> 00:43:08.183
Very few people historically have given realisation, so far.

00:43:09.953 --> 00:43:13.905
But you people are giving left and right to anybody who comes, you know.

00:43:14.170 --> 00:43:16.643
Just now I said all right, come along, look at this person.

00:43:17.347 --> 00:43:19.632
So all of you sit down, "this is it, this is it."

00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:23.026
You have crossed the limits of science now.

00:43:23.871 --> 00:43:26.667
You have become science yourself of the divine

00:43:26.948 --> 00:43:28.918
and you know each and everything about it,

00:43:28.916 --> 00:43:32.653
this chakra is catching, that is catching, I am catching, you are catching.

00:43:33.561 --> 00:43:36.464
But the way we deal with others is the Guru Pada.

00:43:39.770 --> 00:43:42.534
Kindness, sweetness, concern,

00:43:44.241 --> 00:43:46.510
that's what your Mother has given you,

00:43:48.499 --> 00:43:49.332
concern.

00:43:56.854 --> 00:43:58.854
The concern that flows

00:44:00.824 --> 00:44:02.824
about each and every person.

00:44:05.044 --> 00:44:07.044
You have to have concern.

00:44:08.670 --> 00:44:10.670
But these gurus "no you go,

00:44:11.577 --> 00:44:16.070
then die, kill yourself, eat grass."

00:44:20.011 --> 00:44:22.011
No not that way.

00:44:24.701 --> 00:44:28.696
So you also have to be a motherly guru.

00:44:32.418 --> 00:44:35.996
A sweet guru. Extremely sweet,

00:44:37.341 --> 00:44:38.717
kindly

00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:46.039
and understanding, forgiving.

00:44:49.229 --> 00:44:51.507
Because what is the purpose,

00:44:54.384 --> 00:44:56.384
what is the purpose?

00:44:57.009 --> 00:44:59.009
The purpose is to spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:45:00.260 --> 00:45:02.260
That's the main thing we miss out

00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:06.356
that the purpose of our realisation or of our birth

00:45:06.574 --> 00:45:09.116
is to give realisations to others,

00:45:09.272 --> 00:45:12.899
to spread Sahaja Yoga, to emancipate others,

00:45:12.961 --> 00:45:16.065
by that to emancipate the whole world, it's our responsibility.

00:45:18.192 --> 00:45:20.445
If you are responsible then how do you behave?

00:45:25.199 --> 00:45:28.918
So no more we have priesthood, no more.

00:45:29.418 --> 00:45:35.933
Nor that one person says so, that person says so, this has happened, nothing of the kind.

00:45:36.433 --> 00:45:39.232
What you have to say you say to that person.

00:45:41.077 --> 00:45:43.077
And you yourself will see

00:45:43.264 --> 00:45:47.376
how you are reflecting your personality on another person,

00:45:49.503 --> 00:45:51.108
how he reacts

00:45:53.203 --> 00:45:55.203
and how he behaves.

00:45:55.922 --> 00:46:00.503
Gradually I have seen our collectivity is learning all this.

00:46:01.159 --> 00:46:03.159
Gradually I find all those

00:46:03.471 --> 00:46:07.594
horrible dominating people have run away from Sahaja Yoga.

00:46:08.094 --> 00:46:13.913
Also I find that people are extremely loving

00:46:15.570 --> 00:46:19.982
and kindly to each other and also to others

00:46:22.703 --> 00:46:27.998
because you are embodiment of goodness, embodiment of righteousness,

00:46:28.498 --> 00:46:33.557
you are embodiment of patience, compassion, love and concern.

00:46:39.030 --> 00:46:41.030
So it is not how you can do it,

00:46:42.562 --> 00:46:44.562
you are already.

00:46:46.814 --> 00:46:49.453
But you shouldn't just give up.

00:46:49.578 --> 00:46:53.417
I said just look at something and watch.

00:46:54.324 --> 00:46:56.324
Nobody can do that, but you all can do it.

00:46:59.107 --> 00:47:02.945
So the self-esteem and then assumption.

00:47:03.445 --> 00:47:05.445
Assume your powers.

00:47:08.604 --> 00:47:12.065
If you are a guru then assume your power.

00:47:13.941 --> 00:47:15.941
You do not assume you power.

00:47:17.504 --> 00:47:19.504
You still think,

00:47:21.286 --> 00:47:25.700
God knows if I have the powers or not, this, that.

00:47:25.918 --> 00:47:27.918
That means you are just the beginners.

00:47:29.419 --> 00:47:31.419
"No, I am the guru, all right."

00:47:35.610 --> 00:47:38.868
We do say Mother I am my own guru, that's all.

00:47:39.587 --> 00:47:41.587
But is just saying from the lips.

00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:45.813
Not only that you are your own guru but of the whole world.

00:47:49.222 --> 00:47:55.014
It's a collectum Gurudom we have, I should say, collective.

00:47:56.140 --> 00:47:59.855
And nothing can escape us now. We are formidable,

00:48:00.105 --> 00:48:04.225
absolutely formidable. Nothing can escape us.

00:48:07.540 --> 00:48:10.839
If this is understood

00:48:13.622 --> 00:48:16.674
that we have to assume.

00:48:18.644 --> 00:48:23.430
Here now, elect somebody who is a very cruel man,

00:48:23.711 --> 00:48:29.407
put some clothes on him and say he's the pope, all right he's the pope.

00:48:30.595 --> 00:48:32.595
But he's not,

00:48:34.096 --> 00:48:36.096
he's just acting

00:48:36.940 --> 00:48:38.940
but inside he's not.

00:48:39.221 --> 00:48:43.691
That he's infallible! He's fallible, 100 times.

00:48:46.756 --> 00:48:48.756
That is not with us.

00:48:49.631 --> 00:48:52.590
We have all these things within ourselves.

00:48:53.090 --> 00:48:55.928
We've got them, they are there,

00:48:55.990 --> 00:48:59.329
we are the possessors of that, only thing you assume.

00:49:00.173 --> 00:49:03.874
Once you start assuming all badhas will run away, everything will run away

00:49:03.967 --> 00:49:05.269
and you'll be surprised.

00:49:05.456 --> 00:49:07.456
Who can stand a person

00:49:08.582 --> 00:49:10.582
who's a saint, who is a guru

00:49:10.675 --> 00:49:14.339
and who knows he's a guru. Nobody can stand. They'll run away.

00:49:18.624 --> 00:49:22.672
But you have to have

00:49:22.922 --> 00:49:26.726
introspection to see that your self-esteem

00:49:26.819 --> 00:49:28.819
is completely

00:49:31.509 --> 00:49:34.568
correct. It's not just you are thinking you are a Guru.

00:49:37.508 --> 00:49:39.508
I have known some real gurus

00:49:40.946 --> 00:49:42.946
and I would never allow you to go to them.

00:49:43.884 --> 00:49:48.189
God knows if you can come back in one piece or not.

00:49:50.910 --> 00:49:55.561
And I have told them, that they are real gurus, I know, but don't go near them.

00:49:58.251 --> 00:50:02.781
Because what they lack is this compassion, this Sahaj style.

00:50:03.781 --> 00:50:08.590
Because they think they have worked very hard so why should these people not work very hard.

00:50:12.969 --> 00:50:19.134
You may be anything. You can be doing this work, that work.

00:50:19.728 --> 00:50:23.466
You may be educated, not educated. Makes no difference.

00:50:23.966 --> 00:50:27.795
Whether you are rich, poor, makes no difference at all,

00:50:31.673 --> 00:50:37.191
as long as you know that you are the guru and you assume your power.

00:50:38.129 --> 00:50:40.129
In that assumption

00:50:41.317 --> 00:50:44.788
as if any talent, if you know music, you know you know music.

00:50:46.696 --> 00:50:49.197
If you know how to cook, you know how to cook,

00:50:51.261 --> 00:50:54.960
if you are an administrator and if you know administration, you know administration.

00:50:55.460 --> 00:50:59.860
But that could be also not totally absolute,

00:51:00.704 --> 00:51:03.490
but you are already absolute.

00:51:03.990 --> 00:51:06.777
Totality of reality,

00:51:07.527 --> 00:51:10.630
the reality is at your disposal.

00:51:11.130 --> 00:51:15.057
But you assume it, you are not ordinary at all.

00:51:16.526 --> 00:51:19.516
You can say you are extraordinary in ordinary.

00:51:24.583 --> 00:51:31.537
In that, you will just drop out all that is nonsensical, just drop out.

00:51:34.571 --> 00:51:36.571
Others will see you and be surprised,

00:51:38.729 --> 00:51:40.729
what sort of people these are,

00:51:42.637 --> 00:51:46.072
what sort of a life they lead, how nice they are,

00:51:46.728 --> 00:51:48.728
how kind they are.

00:51:49.791 --> 00:51:53.942
And the knowledge is so subtle and so great and

00:51:55.005 --> 00:51:57.743
of such a highest degree.

00:51:58.806 --> 00:52:01.125
But you never feel bloated up with ego.

00:52:01.218 --> 00:52:02.804
I have not seen any Sahaja yogi

00:52:02.929 --> 00:52:06.924
who says, "Oh, I know all about chakras and this and that. How dare you say like that."

00:52:07.424 --> 00:52:09.424
With the moustaches upward.

00:52:13.771 --> 00:52:18.532
No, with all this knowledge you bend down

00:52:18.657 --> 00:52:22.118
like the tree, which is laden with fruits bends down.

00:52:23.775 --> 00:52:26.156
And that humility,

00:52:26.656 --> 00:52:30.470
that simplicity and that humility gives you

00:52:32.096 --> 00:52:34.096
the special edge

00:52:36.441 --> 00:52:39.450
which can pierce into any heart.

00:52:42.984 --> 00:52:47.515
Thus you became apostles of truth.

00:52:48.422 --> 00:52:53.182
You can become prophets like William Blake, you can.

00:52:56.309 --> 00:53:00.941
So many things you'll be manifesting and you won't believe yourself.

00:53:08.354 --> 00:53:09.655
But believe,

00:53:11.844 --> 00:53:19.941
you are one with that great power which is God Almighty.

00:53:21.316 --> 00:53:24.206
They were discussing for ages I think

00:53:24.362 --> 00:53:29.708
about the immaculate conception of Christ.

00:53:30.427 --> 00:53:33.553
Such stupid people I have never seen.

00:53:35.148 --> 00:53:37.148
But he's God!

00:53:38.962 --> 00:53:42.054
He is God Almighty he is not a human being.

00:53:42.804 --> 00:53:44.804
He can do anything.

00:53:51.247 --> 00:53:53.247
How can you judge Him

00:53:53.747 --> 00:53:55.747
and judge His powers

00:53:56.716 --> 00:53:58.716
and His working, how can you.

00:54:00.311 --> 00:54:03.803
To discuss about God, have you got His brains.

00:54:06.148 --> 00:54:10.777
But it's something, a person like me discussing about banking.

00:54:15.844 --> 00:54:20.796
After say one or two sentences I go off.

00:54:23.517 --> 00:54:25.517
In the same way

00:54:26.017 --> 00:54:31.066
when you start discussing God you must know you do not have

00:54:31.973 --> 00:54:33.973
that capacity

00:54:35.005 --> 00:54:38.992
to discuss about God, what His relations are,

00:54:39.210 --> 00:54:42.114
how He got a son, this and that.

00:54:42.614 --> 00:54:43.802
Who are you!

00:54:44.709 --> 00:54:50.365
What's your own position that you can discuss?

00:54:55.056 --> 00:54:59.076
And then in that humility you realise is God Almighty,

00:55:01.317 --> 00:55:02.702
he is Almighty.

00:55:06.486 --> 00:55:12.858
He can do anything than that faith,

00:55:14.766 --> 00:55:15.665
not blind,

00:55:17.322 --> 00:55:23.170
but a real faith in that feeling that God is Almighty

00:55:25.234 --> 00:55:28.721
and that now you have become the messenger of that.

00:55:29.033 --> 00:55:33.104
God Almighty gives you all the strength, all the courage,

00:55:38.421 --> 00:55:44.979
everything, and His compassion, His love, His attention and His understanding.

00:55:45.479 --> 00:55:52.197
So this faith should be absolutely one with Him.

00:55:54.480 --> 00:55:56.669
Once I went to meet one real guru.

00:55:57.169 --> 00:55:59.169
Oh he was a very horrid fellow otherwise.

00:55:59.951 --> 00:56:04.638
He has slapped so many people, thrown so many people down from the hills

00:56:04.700 --> 00:56:10.175
and all that kinds of things he has done, no doubt. But still for me he has tremendous regards.

00:56:10.675 --> 00:56:12.675
I went to him,

00:56:14.082 --> 00:56:17.499
so he just started talking to me as if you talk to a Goddess.

00:56:19.219 --> 00:56:21.845
He said: "How do you find these worldly people here."

00:56:22.001 --> 00:56:24.849
I said: "All right, after all I have created them."

00:56:32.074 --> 00:56:34.074
Ah but he said "Still but,

00:56:34.574 --> 00:56:38.601
you are God with your power why don't you change them a little bit.".

00:56:40.884 --> 00:56:44.942
I said: "That's what is problem. I have given them freedom.

00:56:45.442 --> 00:56:49.207
I have said all right it's freedom to you.

00:56:50.645 --> 00:56:55.891
You can choose if you want to get transformed or not, I cannot force you."

00:56:57.329 --> 00:57:00.840
He said: "But God Almighty you are, you can do anything."

00:57:02.935 --> 00:57:07.311
I said: "I can do everything but I do not want to do certain things.

00:57:08.468 --> 00:57:14.904
One of them is to take away the freedom from them.

00:57:15.404 --> 00:57:17.404
That is their freedom to choose

00:57:18.248 --> 00:57:21.771
that's given to them because if they are to have the ultimate freedom

00:57:21.830 --> 00:57:24.271
they should have this little freedom intact."

00:57:27.930 --> 00:57:29.930
So he was quarrelling with me about this,

00:57:30.774 --> 00:57:32.774
he said "But when you are God Almighty

00:57:33.774 --> 00:57:35.774
there could be some other method

00:57:36.026 --> 00:57:38.821
these horrible people, what to do?" 

00:57:41.198 --> 00:57:43.198
I said: "Your concern is all right.

00:57:44.761 --> 00:57:47.866
I understand because you are a guru,

00:57:49.492 --> 00:57:52.523
but when I am God Almighty supposing,

00:57:53.742 --> 00:57:58.101
then, my style is different. I can't be like you."

00:57:59.696 --> 00:58:04.051
Then he said "That's true, you can't be like me."

00:58:07.009 --> 00:58:10.101
That is what I have found in him.

00:58:10.135 --> 00:58:12.220
He was talking to me only

00:58:12.466 --> 00:58:15.514
as if I am God standing before him.

00:58:20.276 --> 00:58:23.597
And then he told all the disciples, "You see, you praise,

00:58:24.203 --> 00:58:26.203
you praise the Lord, praise Her.

00:58:26.880 --> 00:58:29.693
Suti kara, because

00:58:29.998 --> 00:58:31.596
God is fond of praise."

00:58:34.166 --> 00:58:36.166
I said "Really." "Yes.

00:58:38.418 --> 00:58:39.783
If you praise the Lord

00:58:39.876 --> 00:58:41.876
then he gives you everything. I have seen that.

00:58:42.057 --> 00:58:43.306
I always praise Him.

00:58:44.443 --> 00:58:46.443
Whenever I want something to be done

00:58:46.554 --> 00:58:48.554
I just praise Him and He does it for me."

00:58:51.779 --> 00:58:53.923
So, I said "it's true,

00:58:54.883 --> 00:58:58.097
I must accept it." It's Bhakti Gamya.

00:59:00.013 --> 00:59:03.306
You cannot get to Mother

00:59:03.381 --> 00:59:05.936
unless and until you have really bhakti from your heart.

00:59:05.993 --> 00:59:11.951
Is all already sort of a built in restriction,

00:59:12.009 --> 00:59:13.120
what can you do.

00:59:14.204 --> 00:59:17.374
If you don't have bhakti you cannot get to Mother,

00:59:17.874 --> 00:59:18.931
no you cannot.

00:59:19.431 --> 00:59:20.592
You cannot get to God.

00:59:23.021 --> 00:59:27.446
But if you have bhakti then you can get to Mother.

00:59:27.946 --> 00:59:29.946
Is written Bhakti Gamya.

00:59:32.269 --> 00:59:34.502
If somebody says "All right. Raise my Kundalini."

00:59:36.064 --> 00:59:41.629
I cannot raise his Kundalini, not, but for seven lives he won't have realisation.

00:59:42.819 --> 00:59:47.204
But if somebody says "Mother will you please give me realisation." at once.

00:59:49.756 --> 00:59:51.920
So not only humility but bhakti.

00:59:52.969 --> 00:59:55.952
And bhakti is only possible if you have your faith.

00:59:56.452 --> 00:59:58.452
That's the thing is the faith

00:59:58.952 --> 01:00:03.165
which is challenged nowadays by all kinds of stupid people; intellectuals,

01:00:03.205 --> 01:00:05.205
these horrible people who are

01:00:05.369 --> 01:00:07.138
taking out the /?/ out of their heads, 

01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:09.789
or also by science and this so called

01:00:09.882 --> 01:00:12.391
catholic church and this church and that church.

01:00:17.191 --> 01:00:21.658
So your faith in God has to be absolutely,

01:00:21.857 --> 01:00:27.608
absolutely untarnishable.

01:00:28.108 --> 01:00:33.255
Nothing can disturb that. That's very important.

01:00:34.570 --> 01:00:37.062
You have seen all the miracles of God.

01:00:37.195 --> 01:00:42.107
You have seen how you working out His powers.

01:00:43.952 --> 01:00:50.645
You have known all these things. But still the faith in God is missing.

01:00:52.004 --> 01:00:58.370
But the person who has complete faith on God is called as the one ... is God himself they say.

01:01:00.663 --> 01:01:02.663
Is called as Paramachaitanya.

01:01:05.486 --> 01:01:07.486
The Guru is called as

01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:14.010
the one who is himself Brahmachaitanya.

01:01:17.810 --> 01:01:22.386
So when this faith in God

01:01:22.886 --> 01:01:25.859
is absolutely established in you,

01:01:26.929 --> 01:01:32.527
that there is God Almighty, he's Almighty,

01:01:33.027 --> 01:01:37.645
and that I am the messenger of that God.

01:01:39.001 --> 01:01:44.637
Just this understanding when it becomes absolutely firm in you,

01:01:45.137 --> 01:01:47.671
then you are in the Guru Pada.

01:01:49.190 --> 01:01:52.967
I bless you today that all of you achieve that state

01:01:53.467 --> 01:01:58.028
that you reside in that Guru Pada state.

01:01:58.528 --> 01:02:00.409
And where, wherever you are,

01:02:00.909 --> 01:02:05.275
whatever may be your position, whatever you may do,

01:02:09.524 --> 01:02:11.524
the faith in the God Almighty

01:02:12.757 --> 01:02:15.819
that is so truly within you will express itself.

01:02:16.849 --> 01:02:18.849
Not only but that it will manifest.

01:02:20.123 --> 01:02:23.310
It will act, just like God.

01:02:29.229 --> 01:02:31.229
So many things can be said.

01:02:31.485 --> 01:02:33.485
I have said so many things before.

01:02:34.433 --> 01:02:37.501
And so many can be said later on also

01:02:39.020 --> 01:02:41.463
but today we have to remember one thing

01:02:41.596 --> 01:02:45.619
that we must have complete faith

01:02:45.915 --> 01:02:47.711
in the Kingdom of God

01:02:47.804 --> 01:02:52.409
and in the powers of God Almighty, complete faith,

01:02:53.805 --> 01:02:55.805
and then in ourselves.

01:02:57.609 --> 01:02:59.609
May God bless you all.
