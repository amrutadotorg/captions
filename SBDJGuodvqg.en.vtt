00:46:22.024 --> 00:46:26.274
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:46:33.524 --> 00:46:36.649
Some of you have found the truth,

00:46:37.669 --> 00:46:43.274
some of you have not found it fully,

00:46:44.023 --> 00:46:48.023
and some of you have not found it at all.

00:46:49.944 --> 00:46:58.024
But if you look around in today's situation,

00:46:59.891 --> 00:47:03.767
you'll have to agree there's a big turmoil going on.

00:47:06.170 --> 00:47:09.017
Countries after countries are taking

00:47:09.767 --> 00:47:12.891
to all kinds of wrong things.

00:47:13.392 --> 00:47:16.267
Lot of cold war is on,

00:47:17.642 --> 00:47:20.017
people are killing each other,

00:47:21.142 --> 00:47:26.642
destroying beautiful places,

00:47:30.017 --> 00:47:34.392
cutting each other's throat for nothing at all.

00:47:35.891 --> 00:47:41.267
They are all human beings created by God.

00:47:41.891 --> 00:47:44.891
God Almighty has created them

00:47:45.392 --> 00:47:49.392
and has brought them to this level of human awareness.

00:47:51.517 --> 00:47:53.392
At this juncture

00:47:54.517 --> 00:47:59.017
one can't see where are we going in a collective way.

00:48:03.891 --> 00:48:08.892
This is, where have we to reach --or

00:48:10.142 --> 00:48:12.891
is it our destiny?

00:48:14.891 --> 00:48:18.891
Is this the destiny of human beings,

00:48:20.892 --> 00:48:23.267
to be destroyed by each other

00:48:25.142 --> 00:48:28.517
for land or for anything else?

00:48:29.767 --> 00:48:33.267
Think of the whole world as one,

00:48:34.517 --> 00:48:38.392
and think what's happening all over:

00:48:38.767 --> 00:48:41.517
every day we read newspaper,

00:48:41.891 --> 00:48:46.142
every day there is some sort of a horrible news

00:48:46.392 --> 00:48:50.642
about horrible things people are doing to each other,

00:48:51.017 --> 00:48:53.142
for no rhyme and reason.

00:48:57.892 --> 00:49:02.142
We have to think, what is the destiny?

00:49:03.517 --> 00:49:05.891
Where are we going?

00:49:07.142 --> 00:49:13.267
Are we going to hell or to Heaven?

00:49:15.392 --> 00:49:19.892
What is our situation around? Can we help it?

00:49:23.517 --> 00:49:26.017
What's wrong with human beings is

00:49:27.392 --> 00:49:35.891
they are still in the complete control of ignorance

00:49:36.267 --> 00:49:38.891
I would call it ignorance.

00:49:40.142 --> 00:49:42.892
And in that ignorance, in that darkness,

00:49:44.517 --> 00:49:47.767
they are doing these horrible things.

00:49:48.892 --> 00:49:54.767
Nobody wants to understand that what we are doing

00:49:56.142 --> 00:49:59.642
is nothing but complete destruction.

00:50:01.017 --> 00:50:03.517
Is that our destiny,

00:50:03.892 --> 00:50:07.392
that we are going to get destroyed completely?

00:50:08.392 --> 00:50:11.267
What good are we doing?

00:50:13.267 --> 00:50:17.517
Under the name of some sort of nationality

00:50:17.891 --> 00:50:20.767
or maybe some religion

00:50:21.017 --> 00:50:25.267
-- all kinds of things which are good --

00:50:25.891 --> 00:50:28.891
but we are doing all wrong things.

00:50:29.142 --> 00:50:31.017
Fighting.

00:50:31.517 --> 00:50:34.767
Fighting is not the only thing.

00:50:35.891 --> 00:50:37.517
We hate.

00:50:39.767 --> 00:50:44.142
Anybody who can excite our hatred

00:50:46.642 --> 00:50:51.642
is very much adorable, very much liked,

00:50:52.017 --> 00:50:55.517
and under his guidance we form groups.

00:50:57.392 --> 00:51:03.767
All this is coming because this is the Last Judgment.

00:51:04.142 --> 00:51:08.142
I have told you this is the Last Judgment.

00:51:09.642 --> 00:51:13.891
And this Last Judgment will really decide

00:51:15.017 --> 00:51:19.017
who are to be saved and who are to be doomed completely.

00:51:20.392 --> 00:51:23.891
It's a very, very serious thing.

00:51:25.017 --> 00:51:32.891
All of those who are aware should think about it.

00:51:33.891 --> 00:51:35.517
Little patchwork here

00:51:35.891 --> 00:51:38.891
and a little patchwork is not going to help.

00:51:39.891 --> 00:51:41.891
Whatever you may try,

00:51:42.267 --> 00:51:46.891
unless and until you transform human beings,

00:51:47.142 --> 00:51:49.267
they cannot be saved.

00:51:51.142 --> 00:51:58.767
This transformation is not an impossible thing

00:51:59.267 --> 00:52:01.392
-- it's not difficult.

00:52:01.891 --> 00:52:04.891
This is the time for transformation,

00:52:05.267 --> 00:52:07.891
this is a chance for transformation.

00:52:08.267 --> 00:52:14.142
And within us is placed the power,

00:52:15.267 --> 00:52:18.517
as Tao has described,

00:52:18.891 --> 00:52:22.142
is the mystical feminine Power within us.

00:52:22.642 --> 00:52:25.017
All of them have described it,

00:52:26.392 --> 00:52:29.517
I'm not the first person to say that;

00:52:31.142 --> 00:52:35.891
but nobody has been able perhaps so far

00:52:37.517 --> 00:52:41.891
to understand it or to accept it,

00:52:42.267 --> 00:52:44.891
that it should happen to you.

00:52:48.392 --> 00:52:53.891
You are born not only to be human beings,

00:52:54.891 --> 00:52:57.767
but you have to be superhuman.

00:52:58.891 --> 00:53:00.892
You have to enjoy yourself.

00:53:01.392 --> 00:53:05.017
Your life should be enjoyable, it should be blissful.

00:53:05.517 --> 00:53:07.517
It should not be a curse:

00:53:07.891 --> 00:53:11.517
morning till evening worried about this, worried about that.

00:53:13.891 --> 00:53:16.517
That is why you are created.

00:53:16.891 --> 00:53:20.891
God had no intention of creating people

00:53:21.392 --> 00:53:25.392
who will be all the time worried how to quarrel,

00:53:25.767 --> 00:53:27.767
how to fight, how to save;

00:53:29.017 --> 00:53:33.892
but people who will live in complete harmony,

00:53:34.642 --> 00:53:37.142
peace and joy.

00:53:39.267 --> 00:53:41.267
That's why we are created.

00:53:41.767 --> 00:53:44.891
That is our destiny -- that is,

00:53:45.267 --> 00:53:48.142
not just I am telling you, but it's a fact.

00:53:48.767 --> 00:53:56.892
So we have to be, we have to be transformed.

00:53:58.517 --> 00:54:01.017
This transformation is not difficult.

00:54:01.642 --> 00:54:08.767
But what I find, people get satisfied with anything

00:54:10.017 --> 00:54:12.891
Hindus will go to the temple;

00:54:13.017 --> 00:54:15.642
they'll think, "Oh, we have done a great thing."

00:54:16.142 --> 00:54:18.392
Christians go to the church;

00:54:18.891 --> 00:54:20.892
they'll think they have done very good.

00:54:21.642 --> 00:54:25.267
Muslims will go and pray and think that they are great.

00:54:25.891 --> 00:54:27.891
What have they achieved?

00:54:28.392 --> 00:54:30.767
Face yourself, please.

00:54:31.017 --> 00:54:34.891
Face your limitations.

00:54:35.267 --> 00:54:37.392
Face your tribulations.

00:54:37.767 --> 00:54:40.892
Face your problems and see for yourself:

00:54:41.392 --> 00:54:44.267
have you been able to solve your problems?

00:54:47.642 --> 00:54:53.891
Have you been able to save yourself from calamities?

00:54:55.392 --> 00:55:00.892
Maybe big calamities may come to destroy people who are,

00:55:01.642 --> 00:55:04.891
who are doing harm, maybe.

00:55:06.267 --> 00:55:08.767
That may be the wish of God.

00:55:09.142 --> 00:55:11.892
But what is your wish?

00:55:12.767 --> 00:55:14.891
Why don't you think that

00:55:15.267 --> 00:55:21.642
"I have to be a person who is a store,

00:55:22.017 --> 00:55:27.017
who is a source of joy and love"?

00:55:28.517 --> 00:55:33.142
I am not only talking, but I want you all

00:55:33.642 --> 00:55:35.767
to get your Self-realization.

00:55:36.392 --> 00:55:37.891
What is Self-realization

00:55:38.392 --> 00:55:41.891
-- is to know your Self. You don't know your Self.

00:55:42.892 --> 00:55:44.767
You don't know.

00:55:45.392 --> 00:55:47.892
You are living in this world without knowing your Self

00:55:48.392 --> 00:55:49.892
-- can you imagine?

00:55:50.392 --> 00:55:52.142
You don't know what you are.

00:55:52.767 --> 00:55:55.767
You don't know that you are the spirit,

00:55:57.017 --> 00:56:02.517
and that you are the source of knowledge,

00:56:02.891 --> 00:56:04.767
of pure knowledge.

00:56:05.142 --> 00:56:07.767
I find people sitting in a meeting,

00:56:08.267 --> 00:56:11.642
listening to some babaji

00:56:12.142 --> 00:56:16.142
who is telling them some story, very happy.

00:56:16.891 --> 00:56:22.767
This is not going to give you the reality and the truth.

00:56:23.891 --> 00:56:26.392
If you want to have reality and truth,

00:56:26.891 --> 00:56:29.017
then please try to understand

00:56:29.517 --> 00:56:31.892
that something has to happen

00:56:32.517 --> 00:56:35.892
to you, some transformation has to take place.

00:56:36.642 --> 00:56:38.891
You are not yet subtle enough,

00:56:39.392 --> 00:56:41.267
you haven't got those subtleties,

00:56:41.767 --> 00:56:43.891
till you reach that point --

00:56:44.267 --> 00:56:47.892
for which you don't have to leave your family,

00:56:48.642 --> 00:56:51.142
you don't have to leave your children,

00:56:52.267 --> 00:56:59.142
you don't have to leave your household and go to the jungles.

00:57:00.517 --> 00:57:02.891
There's no need to do all that.

00:57:03.517 --> 00:57:07.017
It's nice to say that "All right, you all take sanyasa

00:57:07.642 --> 00:57:10.517
and give all that belongs to you to me."

00:57:12.642 --> 00:57:15.267
It's such a stupid idea.

00:57:15.891 --> 00:57:19.891
These are emergencies today.

00:57:21.017 --> 00:57:25.767
We are living in a very emergent conditions

00:57:26.142 --> 00:57:27.642
-- try to understand.

00:57:28.017 --> 00:57:30.142
And I want to warn you

00:57:30.642 --> 00:57:33.017
that if you don't go deep into yourself

00:57:33.517 --> 00:57:36.267
and find out what you are,

00:57:37.892 --> 00:57:41.392
and take to your transformation,

00:57:41.891 --> 00:57:43.892
anything is possible.

00:57:45.392 --> 00:57:48.267
All kinds of diseases are coming up,

00:57:48.891 --> 00:57:53.142
all kinds of new problems of children coming up,

00:57:53.891 --> 00:57:57.392
all kinds of national problems are there,

00:57:57.892 --> 00:58:00.891
all kinds of international problems are there,

00:58:01.392 --> 00:58:04.267
that people can't help it.

00:58:05.517 --> 00:58:12.767
So we have to get out of this and become a solid,

00:58:13.017 --> 00:58:16.142
a personality of truth.

00:58:16.767 --> 00:58:18.767
We don't know what is the truth is.

00:58:20.392 --> 00:58:25.891
We are worse than animals whose eyes are open,

00:58:27.891 --> 00:58:30.017
while our eyes are closed.

00:58:31.392 --> 00:58:34.892
Is not to condemn yourself in any way,

00:58:36.017 --> 00:58:38.642
but to make you alert and aware

00:58:39.142 --> 00:58:42.392
that human beings have to change.

00:58:42.892 --> 00:58:46.892
Otherwise it's just, you come to My lecture,

00:58:47.392 --> 00:58:51.017
tomorrow you come to another lecture -- that's all.

00:58:51.517 --> 00:58:54.892
It's a everyday sort of a nice entertainment.

00:58:56.767 --> 00:59:01.642
But when I see the destiny,

00:59:02.142 --> 00:59:05.017
I don't know how many will be ruined,

00:59:05.767 --> 00:59:08.142
how many will be finished.

00:59:08.767 --> 00:59:10.642
What will happen to them?

00:59:11.017 --> 00:59:13.267
What diseases they will get,

00:59:13.891 --> 00:59:16.392
what problems they will get?

00:59:16.891 --> 00:59:19.017
What will happen to their children,

00:59:20.017 --> 00:59:22.392
what will happen to their country,

00:59:22.891 --> 00:59:25.517
and what will happen to the whole world?

00:59:26.891 --> 00:59:29.767
Just widen your vision.

00:59:30.891 --> 00:59:35.642
My vision is that all the people of the world

00:59:36.142 --> 00:59:38.517
should get transformation.

00:59:39.891 --> 00:59:43.767
We have enemies within ourselves,

00:59:46.392 --> 00:59:48.267
and when they talk of jihad,

00:59:48.767 --> 00:59:52.392
they talk that you fight your enemies within yourself.

00:59:52.892 --> 00:59:54.892
What are these enemies?

00:59:56.267 --> 00:59:59.892
These days, the worst is greed.

01:00:01.267 --> 01:00:03.642
There is greed.

01:00:04.017 --> 01:00:09.392
With that greed people can do anything they want to

01:00:09.892 --> 01:00:13.892
All kinds of things are happening out of greed.

01:00:14.517 --> 01:00:19.517
They'll have money, they'll have all kinds of facilities,

01:00:19.892 --> 01:00:24.767
but still this greed is such a satanic will of,

01:00:25.017 --> 01:00:28.017
that you don't even see what you have.

01:00:28.642 --> 01:00:32.892
And you want to have more and more, deceive people,

01:00:33.517 --> 01:00:36.392
deceive your government,

01:00:36.891 --> 01:00:40.267
deceive everyone and manage it.

01:00:45.891 --> 01:00:52.517
Then, another worse thing we have is anger.

01:00:53.891 --> 01:00:57.767
Anger doesn't allow you to see things as they are.

01:01:00.517 --> 01:01:04.517
We develop anger for small things:

01:01:05.891 --> 01:01:09.892
like you have come to this country --

01:01:11.392 --> 01:01:18.891
I've seen people who are angry because of different color.

01:01:21.891 --> 01:01:23.892
I can't understand.

01:01:24.642 --> 01:01:27.017
God has made different colors;

01:01:27.392 --> 01:01:31.642
other we all would have looked same, like military,

01:01:32.517 --> 01:01:34.892
and life would have been miserable.

01:01:35.267 --> 01:01:38.142
So the color has been created by nature.

01:01:38.767 --> 01:01:44.017
So the whites or blacks -- what is the difference?

01:01:45.517 --> 01:01:47.891
I just don't understand.

01:01:48.392 --> 01:01:54.142
Because such a myth is going on.

01:01:55.392 --> 01:01:58.267
With this myth we are fighting.

01:01:58.891 --> 01:02:02.017
The whites are fighting with the blacks,

01:02:02.392 --> 01:02:05.017
and the blacks are fighting with the whites.

01:02:06.517 --> 01:02:14.392
And then they go also for burning their skin in the sun,

01:02:16.517 --> 01:02:18.891
getting skin cancers.

01:02:19.517 --> 01:02:21.517
I just don't understand.

01:02:21.892 --> 01:02:24.892
There's no logic, there's no balance

01:02:25.392 --> 01:02:28.891
in us to see that what we are doing.

01:02:30.267 --> 01:02:34.892
Why are we wasting this precious time,

01:02:35.642 --> 01:02:38.142
when we have to get transformation?

01:02:39.267 --> 01:02:42.392
This anger can be with anything;

01:02:44.891 --> 01:02:47.891
anything one can develop anger.

01:02:48.392 --> 01:02:53.642
Is like a human failing, which is very common.

01:02:54.891 --> 01:02:58.267
For the smallest thing people can get angry.

01:02:58.891 --> 01:03:02.392
And they like it, because with that they can oppress others;

01:03:02.891 --> 01:03:04.891
they could be aggressive.

01:03:05.267 --> 01:03:09.142
So they want to have this anger within them,

01:03:09.891 --> 01:03:14.017
and with that anger they try to dominate others.

01:03:16.017 --> 01:03:18.142
This is the biggest problem:

01:03:18.767 --> 01:03:22.891
why do we want to dominate others,

01:03:23.392 --> 01:03:25.891
why do we want to oppress others,

01:03:26.517 --> 01:03:29.642
and why do we want to take control of others?

01:03:30.017 --> 01:03:32.017
We can't control ourselves;

01:03:32.392 --> 01:03:35.642
why are we wanting to control others?

01:03:36.642 --> 01:03:38.017
What is the need?

01:03:41.142 --> 01:03:44.392
Then, there are attachments:

01:03:45.517 --> 01:03:50.267
attachments to their houses,

01:03:50.642 --> 01:03:55.642
to their lands, to their children, to everything.

01:03:56.142 --> 01:04:02.392
But tomorrow you won't be here.

01:04:04.642 --> 01:04:06.892
You'll go with open hands.

01:04:07.517 --> 01:04:10.767
You can't carry anything with you.

01:04:12.017 --> 01:04:17.267
So such attachment to things:

01:04:18.517 --> 01:04:21.517
they're very particular about their cars,

01:04:21.891 --> 01:04:24.642
about their house, maintain it.

01:04:24.891 --> 01:04:29.891
But what about yourself? Are you all right?

01:04:31.017 --> 01:04:37.017
Inside, are you absolutely calm, peaceful and joyful?

01:04:38.517 --> 01:04:40.892
Why are you wasting your energy

01:04:48.891 --> 01:04:52.142
in getting angry with others?

01:04:57.517 --> 01:05:07.267
That's the sign of life that will be also destroyed.

01:05:10.891 --> 01:05:19.892
If you look at another person he has, say, weaknesses,

01:05:21.642 --> 01:05:25.392
apart from money, for women -- is very common --

01:05:25.892 --> 01:05:28.891
or women having for men.

01:05:30.017 --> 01:05:33.642
To get attractive, for what?

01:05:34.892 --> 01:05:37.267
Everybody has to get old.

01:05:38.517 --> 01:05:44.267
What have you achieved by running after women,

01:05:44.767 --> 01:05:48.891
running after other sex?

01:05:50.017 --> 01:05:54.891
You have no sense of dignity, no sense of honor.

01:05:55.392 --> 01:05:58.267
If you are -- as long as you wear very good clothes

01:05:58.642 --> 01:06:00.891
you are regarded wonderful person.

01:06:02.267 --> 01:06:03.891
This is not the way.

01:06:04.392 --> 01:06:07.891
We have to introspect and see for ourselves:

01:06:08.392 --> 01:06:10.392
why are we doing this,

01:06:10.891 --> 01:06:13.891
wasting our energy into nonsensical thing?

01:06:18.517 --> 01:06:23.767
So many people I meet are really half-mad and far gone;

01:06:24.017 --> 01:06:26.392
some of them are full-mad.

01:06:27.892 --> 01:06:29.892
And what they tell Me, that

01:06:30.392 --> 01:06:32.767
they wanted to marry a particular woman

01:06:32.892 --> 01:06:34.892
and a particular man or anything,

01:06:35.392 --> 01:06:39.017
and that's how they got it. I mean, how fragile!

01:06:41.892 --> 01:06:43.892
That's not being very great.

01:06:44.642 --> 01:06:50.392
You have to be very, very strong within yourself.

01:06:50.891 --> 01:06:55.517
Feel your Self. Your Self is the spirit,

01:06:55.891 --> 01:06:59.267
is the reflection of God Almighty within you.

01:06:59.891 --> 01:07:02.392
You can be very strong,

01:07:02.891 --> 01:07:04.642
you can be very healthy

01:07:04.891 --> 01:07:06.892
and you can be absolutely balanced,

01:07:07.392 --> 01:07:09.142
if you become the spirit.

01:07:10.642 --> 01:07:14.642
You have heard so much about spirit and spiritual life

01:07:17.891 --> 01:07:20.891
-- but have you reached that point?

01:07:22.142 --> 01:07:25.642
Even when you read, say, Zen system,

01:07:25.892 --> 01:07:30.642
Tao system, Bible, Koran, anything,

01:07:32.642 --> 01:07:36.892
do you know how to reach that point of the spirit?

01:07:37.517 --> 01:07:39.892
Not yet. Not yet.

01:07:40.642 --> 01:07:42.891
You have to know that;

01:07:43.267 --> 01:07:45.767
because you are very great,

01:07:46.142 --> 01:07:48.892
you are very precious,

01:07:49.517 --> 01:07:52.891
and you are so beautiful within.

01:07:53.892 --> 01:07:56.267
But you are not aware of it.

01:07:57.392 --> 01:07:59.517
You have to become that.

01:08:00.642 --> 01:08:03.892
That becoming is very important,

01:08:04.517 --> 01:08:09.892
and for that already God Almighty has organized within you

01:08:11.267 --> 01:08:15.017
which is called as kundalini,

01:08:16.892 --> 01:08:18.892
which can be awakened,

01:08:19.642 --> 01:08:24.267
and its awakening can give you Self-realization,

01:08:24.892 --> 01:08:29.392
can give you self-knowledge which we call "Atma sakshatkar."

01:08:29.891 --> 01:08:34.017
That's what is very, very important in your life to have it.

01:08:34.517 --> 01:08:35.892
And when it is free --

01:08:36.517 --> 01:08:39.267
you can't pay for it, how much can you pay?

01:08:41.891 --> 01:08:44.891
-- when it is absolutely free,

01:08:45.267 --> 01:08:48.892
why don't you take your Self-realization,

01:08:49.642 --> 01:08:52.517
and why don't you grow?

01:08:53.017 --> 01:08:56.142
Instead of fighting in the name of religion.

01:08:59.142 --> 01:09:02.642
Every religion has said "You know thy Self."

01:09:05.891 --> 01:09:08.142
Mohammed Sahib has said very clearly,

01:09:08.378 --> 01:09:12.142
"At the time of resurrection your hands will speak."

01:09:13.767 --> 01:09:15.891
Are they speaking?

01:09:17.142 --> 01:09:19.392
Hindus know about it,

01:09:19.891 --> 01:09:22.892
that we have to get our Self-realization.

01:09:23.642 --> 01:09:27.891
No use just listening to these babajis and giving them money.

01:09:32.017 --> 01:09:37.767
All this kind of rituals

01:09:38.892 --> 01:09:41.892
that we have been doing, our forefathers have been doing:

01:09:42.191 --> 01:09:44.517
what have we achieved? Nothing.

01:09:47.245 --> 01:09:50.642
So now, it's important for us to know

01:09:51.017 --> 01:09:56.891
that we have to have our evolution,

01:09:58.517 --> 01:10:01.891
reaching to the point of Self-realization.

01:10:03.421 --> 01:10:06.891
If we were perfect there would have been no problem

01:10:08.392 --> 01:10:11.142
If we were self-realized people

01:10:11.642 --> 01:10:14.142
there would have been no problem.

01:10:15.642 --> 01:10:17.891
All kinds of selfishness,

01:10:18.517 --> 01:10:24.017
all kinds of limits we have put upon ourselves,

01:10:24.767 --> 01:10:27.517
all kinds of conditioning and ego

01:10:28.017 --> 01:10:33.891
which has been working our life and have been ruining us,

01:10:34.142 --> 01:10:37.392
we have to get over it.

01:10:37.475 --> 01:10:40.230
And once you get over it, you get united.

01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:43.355
Nobody has to tell you that you get united.

01:10:43.730 --> 01:10:47.479
You lose all misidentifications.

01:10:50.228 --> 01:10:52.228
The time is running short.

01:10:52.978 --> 01:10:54.978
I've been now here for the last,

01:10:55.353 --> 01:10:57.353
I don't know, twenty years or so.

01:10:57.978 --> 01:11:00.227
I worked very hard,

01:11:00.728 --> 01:11:04.603
but what I find that people don't realize

01:11:04.978 --> 01:11:06.978
what they are supposed to do.

01:11:11.228 --> 01:11:16.228
They like people who will just say something very simple

01:11:16.978 --> 01:11:19.978
-- all right, it's a little entertainment.

01:11:21.228 --> 01:11:26.978
So the whole humanity has to understand

01:11:28.353 --> 01:11:34.228
that destiny of destruction is to be avoided.

01:11:34.978 --> 01:11:38.228
Complete destruction is to be avoided.

01:11:39.728 --> 01:11:44.478
And very simple is that you enter into the Kingdom of God

01:11:45.227 --> 01:11:48.227
-- which is very easy: you don't have to pay anything,

01:11:48.728 --> 01:11:51.103
don't have to work out anything.

01:11:52.478 --> 01:11:54.603
You take your Self-realization,

01:11:55.227 --> 01:12:00.603
and then at home you spend about ten minutes meditating.

01:12:03.103 --> 01:12:08.978
Only your mind is all the time justifying your misbehavior.

01:12:09.353 --> 01:12:13.227
I call it "misbehavior" because it's against you.

01:12:13.603 --> 01:12:18.227
It's against God's wish,

01:12:19.227 --> 01:12:22.228
it's against humanity

01:12:22.728 --> 01:12:26.353
and it will destroy all the human beings.

01:12:28.228 --> 01:12:32.728
All these misidentifications have to be dropped,

01:12:33.227 --> 01:12:36.603
and you have to know that we are all one.

01:12:37.853 --> 01:12:42.227
We are all one, we are all global,

01:12:43.603 --> 01:12:47.478
we are not separated by color,

01:12:47.978 --> 01:12:52.227
race or religion, nation -- no.

01:12:53.603 --> 01:12:55.227
We are all one,

01:12:55.353 --> 01:13:00.830
and that oneness should not be established by slogans

01:13:01.701 --> 01:13:03.202
or by shouting,

01:13:03.227 --> 01:13:06.728
but should be that oneness is to be felt within.

01:13:09.603 --> 01:13:12.228
It's not artificial.

01:13:12.728 --> 01:13:16.227
It has to be real, very real oneness,

01:13:16.603 --> 01:13:19.227
and that comes to you once you realize

01:13:19.478 --> 01:13:22.478
that you are part and parcel of the whole.

01:13:24.853 --> 01:13:30.853
Religions have brought you up to this point of awareness

01:13:31.228 --> 01:13:35.353
-- not for fighting, not for killing.

01:13:38.478 --> 01:13:40.603
Why, why?

01:13:41.227 --> 01:13:44.353
Human beings have diverted themselves.

01:13:44.853 --> 01:13:49.728
Because of complete ignorance of righteousness.

01:13:50.853 --> 01:13:59.478
Because of complete greed of oneself:

01:14:00.978 --> 01:14:06.853
oneself, just yourself, or your family at the most,

01:14:07.228 --> 01:14:09.603
or your relation.

01:14:11.853 --> 01:14:14.145
Why do you want to delimit yourself?

01:14:14.311 --> 01:14:16.227
You are the spirit.

01:14:16.645 --> 01:14:23.227
Spirit is the ocean, ocean of knowledge,

01:14:24.478 --> 01:14:27.103
is the ocean of love,

01:14:28.227 --> 01:14:31.103
is the ocean of all blessings.

01:14:32.353 --> 01:14:35.228
So we have to decide.

01:14:35.853 --> 01:14:38.478
Today I have to request you,

01:14:39.103 --> 01:14:41.853
that there's not so much time left.

01:14:42.353 --> 01:14:47.228
We have to decide that we have to become the spirit

01:14:47.853 --> 01:14:50.603
That's all the religions have taught.

01:14:51.103 --> 01:14:57.603
But how to do it was not so much explained,

01:14:59.227 --> 01:15:01.103
and it didn't work out.

01:15:01.478 --> 01:15:05.353
Some of them did get it but they were outcasted.

01:15:05.978 --> 01:15:07.978
Nobody listened to them.

01:15:08.353 --> 01:15:11.478
Even people killed them and tortured them, crucified them.

01:15:12.978 --> 01:15:19.978
But now, please, all of you try to understand

01:15:20.353 --> 01:15:22.728
the value of your life.

01:15:23.978 --> 01:15:26.228
Why are you a human being?

01:15:26.603 --> 01:15:28.478
Why are you created?

01:15:29.103 --> 01:15:31.103
What is the purpose behind it?

01:15:31.353 --> 01:15:35.978
Are we going to be driven by nonsensical ideas?

01:15:37.828 --> 01:15:47.203
Are we going to be finished by all sorts of dividing factors?

01:15:47.228 --> 01:15:51.978
No, no, we are all going to get your Self-realization,

01:15:53.228 --> 01:15:56.603
and we are going to understand the value of our life.

01:15:58.603 --> 01:16:02.728
The problem is, you'll get your realization

01:16:03.103 --> 01:16:06.978
in the sense the power within you will rise.

01:16:07.353 --> 01:16:09.227
It's very well organized;

01:16:09.603 --> 01:16:12.728
actually, God is a great creator.

01:16:13.227 --> 01:16:18.978
How He has balanced and how it works out is remarkable.

01:16:19.478 --> 01:16:22.227
Every individual He has done it.

01:16:22.728 --> 01:16:27.728
With that happening, is not sufficient.

01:16:29.227 --> 01:16:32.227
You enter into, say, a palace

01:16:32.728 --> 01:16:36.228
and then you go round and see for yourself

01:16:36.728 --> 01:16:39.103
how beautiful you are,

01:16:39.603 --> 01:16:42.853
what beautiful things God has made for you.

01:16:44.353 --> 01:16:46.853
Then grow into it.

01:16:47.227 --> 01:16:49.978
Once you have grown into it,

01:16:50.478 --> 01:16:55.853
then you will realize what a great thing you are:

01:16:57.103 --> 01:17:05.227
the greatest gem, the greatest person, so loving.

01:17:06.478 --> 01:17:08.227
There have been some

01:17:08.728 --> 01:17:11.853
-- they have become just statues.

01:17:12.228 --> 01:17:17.728
Nobody tries to understand what were they doing,

01:17:18.227 --> 01:17:19.853
how they were there.

01:17:23.012 --> 01:17:30.886
So, tonight we can have the experience,

01:17:31.603 --> 01:17:35.227
the experience of the spirit.

01:17:35.603 --> 01:17:39.353
Is a very unusual, rare thing.

01:17:39.853 --> 01:17:41.728
It never used to happen like that.

01:17:42.227 --> 01:17:45.728
But it is now, so why not take advantage of it?

01:17:47.978 --> 01:17:52.103
Please, be ready for that,

01:17:52.478 --> 01:17:56.603
accept it, take it, and become.

01:17:57.227 --> 01:17:59.228
Becoming is the point.

01:17:59.728 --> 01:18:02.228
What you become is the point.

01:18:02.728 --> 01:18:08.978
And what you make out of this whole human civilization

01:18:09.478 --> 01:18:13.103
is your problem, not Mine.

01:18:14.353 --> 01:18:16.728
I can help you.

01:18:17.227 --> 01:18:19.227
I can work it out.

01:18:19.478 --> 01:18:26.603
So I would request you all to now be ready for Self-realization.

01:18:29.228 --> 01:18:31.227
It's much better,

01:18:31.728 --> 01:18:35.228
but those who do not want to have cannot be forced.

01:18:37.227 --> 01:18:40.103
So it's better such people leave,

01:18:40.478 --> 01:18:43.603
leave the hall if they don't want to have.

01:18:47.228 --> 01:18:49.227
May God bless you all.

01:19:16.227 --> 01:19:18.853
Firstly, you don't have to do anything

01:19:21.728 --> 01:19:25.227
-- meaning also, don't think what I have said.

01:19:27.728 --> 01:19:32.603
Try to keep your thoughts very peaceful,

01:19:33.978 --> 01:19:38.103
and I'm sure all of you can get your Self-realization.

01:19:39.728 --> 01:19:42.227
But how many will grow?

01:19:42.728 --> 01:19:47.228
Because you have to come to the follow-up,

01:19:48.728 --> 01:19:52.853
then you have to practice it in the centers

01:19:53.353 --> 01:19:55.978
-- and it works out.

01:19:56.478 --> 01:20:00.353
Little bit time you have to give to yourself,

01:20:01.227 --> 01:20:04.603
and to this global problem.

01:20:06.227 --> 01:20:08.603
You have to dedicate yourself to that.

01:20:09.227 --> 01:20:13.227
Is very important: you have to dedicate yourself.

01:20:13.853 --> 01:20:17.103
That doesn't mean that you have to become sanyasi

01:20:17.353 --> 01:20:20.478
or you have to be busy with this for twenty-four hours -- nothing.

01:20:21.103 --> 01:20:26.603
But this dedication will make you so much

01:20:28.603 --> 01:20:30.353
one with yourself,

01:20:30.978 --> 01:20:33.227
with the whole universe,

01:20:33.728 --> 01:20:37.353
that I don't have to tell you that you dedicate

01:20:37.853 --> 01:20:40.853
-- you'll dedicate by yourself.

01:20:44.227 --> 01:20:47.227
So please don't stay here

01:20:47.478 --> 01:20:49.853
if you don't want to have Self-realization.

01:20:50.353 --> 01:20:52.228
Nothing will happen to you.

01:20:52.853 --> 01:20:58.103
Please leave the hall in case you don't want Self-realization.

01:21:11.478 --> 01:21:17.228
What you have to do is not to do anything;

01:21:18.978 --> 01:21:21.603
to put just your hands towards Me.

01:21:23.603 --> 01:21:26.603
Of course, if you are wearing shoes better take them out,

01:21:27.227 --> 01:21:30.103
because Mother Earth is very important.

01:21:31.603 --> 01:21:34.228
Please put both the hands towards Me.

01:21:48.228 --> 01:21:50.228
You don't have to pray,

01:21:50.728 --> 01:21:52.227
you don't have to say anything; just

01:21:52.728 --> 01:21:55.227
put your hands towards Me, just like this.

01:22:09.228 --> 01:22:12.227
Now please close your eyes.

01:22:12.853 --> 01:22:17.978
It is important. Please close your eyes.

01:22:27.853 --> 01:22:32.728
This power, kundalini, is placed in the triangular bone,

01:22:35.227 --> 01:22:39.227
known as sacrum, means "sacred",

01:22:39.728 --> 01:22:48.728
and it rises through six centers of the parasympathetic,

01:22:49.228 --> 01:22:52.728
and ultimately pierces through

01:22:56.853 --> 01:22:59.728
the fontanel bone area

01:23:00.103 --> 01:23:02.478
which was a soft bone in your head,

01:23:03.227 --> 01:23:05.478
on top of your head.

01:23:10.478 --> 01:23:13.728
When you were a child, it was a soft bone.

01:23:14.228 --> 01:23:17.227
It pierces through that,

01:23:18.978 --> 01:23:21.853
and enters into the subtle energy

01:23:23.853 --> 01:23:31.353
of all-pervading Power of divine love.

01:23:34.227 --> 01:23:36.978
They call it by different name.

01:23:37.478 --> 01:23:42.603
They call it "Paramachaitanya" -- some call it "chaitanya."

01:23:44.227 --> 01:23:47.603
Some call it as "ruh."

01:23:48.227 --> 01:23:54.227
You may call it by any name -- is the love, love of God.

01:23:55.978 --> 01:23:58.228
Once you get connected with you,

01:23:59.603 --> 01:24:03.603
when you start feeling on your fingers

01:24:05.853 --> 01:24:07.728
some sort of a breeze.

01:24:08.227 --> 01:24:11.227
First some people will get hot, doesn't matter;

01:24:12.728 --> 01:24:14.853
but then it cools down

01:24:15.227 --> 01:24:18.978
and you get the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost, as they call it.

01:24:21.603 --> 01:24:23.728
And it starts flowing.

01:24:25.603 --> 01:24:29.228
You can now raise your left hand

01:24:29.728 --> 01:24:33.353
on top of your fontanel bone area.

01:24:33.978 --> 01:24:37.227
Keep your eyes shut, and see for yourself

01:24:37.478 --> 01:24:41.978
if there's a cool or a hot breeze coming out of your head.

01:24:52.103 --> 01:24:53.853
You can move your hand.

01:24:57.103 --> 01:24:59.353
Now see with your right hand

01:25:00.227 --> 01:25:02.853
if there's a cool or a hot breeze

01:25:03.227 --> 01:25:06.353
coming out of your fontanel bone area,

01:25:06.853 --> 01:25:09.728
which was a soft bone in your childhood.

01:25:10.227 --> 01:25:11.728
See for yourself.

01:25:12.103 --> 01:25:14.353
Bend your head; better is to bend.

01:25:14.978 --> 01:25:16.978
Please bend your head.

01:25:18.728 --> 01:25:21.978
Again put your right hand towards Me

01:25:23.478 --> 01:25:29.228
and see for yourself with the left hand,

01:25:29.853 --> 01:25:35.728
see if there is a cool breeze coming out of your head.

01:25:36.227 --> 01:25:39.228
If it is hot it's all right, doesn't matter.

01:25:39.728 --> 01:25:43.103
It is coming because of the heat within you.

01:25:59.603 --> 01:26:04.603
Now all those who have felt cool or a hot breeze

01:26:05.227 --> 01:26:07.728
in their hands or on their fingers,

01:26:08.227 --> 01:26:10.853
or out of the fontanel bone area

01:26:11.227 --> 01:26:13.227
-- this is the real baptism --

01:26:13.353 --> 01:26:16.227
please raise both your hands.

01:26:25.227 --> 01:26:26.603
Just imagine:

01:26:27.227 --> 01:26:31.103
you are the soldiers who are going to save the world

01:26:32.103 --> 01:26:34.227
from its destruction.

01:26:34.728 --> 01:26:36.853
Try to understand your importance.

01:26:38.353 --> 01:26:40.853
You can put down your hand.

01:26:41.228 --> 01:26:45.227
Everyone practically has felt it.

01:26:45.728 --> 01:26:47.728
That means you are already matured

01:26:48.227 --> 01:26:50.103
to get your spiritual life.

01:26:50.353 --> 01:26:53.103
You are just on the brink of it.

01:26:53.603 --> 01:26:55.728
That's how you got it.

01:26:56.227 --> 01:27:01.228
It's last jump to reality.

01:27:01.728 --> 01:27:06.227
Now, you should know what is this, what are you,

01:27:07.227 --> 01:27:09.228
what is your spirit

01:27:10.228 --> 01:27:14.103
and what you can do; what are your powers are,

01:27:14.353 --> 01:27:16.478
what are spiritual powers.

01:27:16.978 --> 01:27:18.728
For this I would request you

01:27:19.227 --> 01:27:21.603
to first to come to the follow-up program,

01:27:22.103 --> 01:27:26.853
and after that you can join any one of the centers

01:27:27.227 --> 01:27:30.353
which are closer to you and work it out.

01:27:30.978 --> 01:27:33.228
We have to work for the whole world.

01:27:34.728 --> 01:27:37.228
You should know there are eighty-five countries

01:27:37.728 --> 01:27:40.227
which are following Sahaja Yoga.

01:27:40.728 --> 01:27:45.978
And surprisingly, black country like Benin,

01:27:46.228 --> 01:27:49.227
we have twenty thousand Sahaja yogis.

01:27:49.603 --> 01:27:52.353
Only three years back I started there.

01:27:52.853 --> 01:27:57.227
And in England it's more than sixteen years

01:27:57.728 --> 01:28:02.228
I've been working here, and after that also:

01:28:02.728 --> 01:28:05.353
all the time, every year.

01:28:05.978 --> 01:28:07.478
But somehow

01:28:13.103 --> 01:28:17.853
their growth is very much there,

01:28:19.227 --> 01:28:26.978
but not subtle growth, not within ourselves.

01:28:31.228 --> 01:28:36.978
The growth is within, and you'll enjoy,

01:28:37.478 --> 01:28:40.227
very much enjoy the reality.

01:28:40.603 --> 01:28:44.353
The reality is beautiful, absolutely beautiful.

01:28:45.978 --> 01:28:47.853
May God bless you.

01:28:52.478 --> 01:28:54.228
They want to sing one song

01:28:54.978 --> 01:28:58.478
which was written in the twelfth century

01:28:58.978 --> 01:29:02.227
by a saint in India and is sung in all the villages,

01:29:02.478 --> 01:29:05.103
but nobody knows the meaning of that.

01:29:06.228 --> 01:29:10.228
The meaning is that "Oh Mother,

01:29:10.853 --> 01:29:13.353
give me the union, 'Jogwa'

01:29:14.103 --> 01:29:15.353
-- give me the union.

01:29:16.728 --> 01:29:21.228
I will give up my bad habits. I'll give up my temper. I'll give ..."

01:29:21.853 --> 01:29:23.227
You don't have to do it.

01:29:23.478 --> 01:29:26.227
Now you'll give up automatically.

01:29:27.728 --> 01:29:30.603
The light that you'll have, itself,

01:29:30.978 --> 01:29:34.728
automatically you will give up, automatically.

01:29:35.227 --> 01:29:36.978
You don't have to do anything.

01:29:37.228 --> 01:29:39.978
But you have to meditate.

01:29:40.311 --> 01:29:44.227
About ten minutes, it's not much.
