00:07.903 --> 00:13.022
Before Realisation whatever you do, as I told you before this,

00:13.103 --> 00:17.767
is artificial, towards God, because you are not connected.

00:17.848 --> 00:20.168
Any kind of worship you do, anything you do,

00:20.168 --> 00:26.143
is not really reaching the principle of that.

00:26.220 --> 00:31.823
Now, for example the flame: the principle of flame is light.

00:32.686 --> 00:34.905
And unless until you are awakened,

00:34.939 --> 00:37.605
you cannot awaken the principle,

00:38.218 --> 00:40.777
you cannot touch the principle of flame.

00:41.757 --> 00:47.238
So, once you are awakened, then, as you are on your principle,

00:47.298 --> 00:53.420
you can go on the principle of the flame as well.

00:53.567 --> 00:56.683
After Realisation, when you start using the flame,

00:56.768 --> 00:59.321
you must have seen that it gives soot,

00:59.408 --> 01:01.808
black soot come out of it sometimes.

01:02.043 --> 01:04.864
I know of somebody who told me that

01:05.250 --> 01:08.554
the whole wall became black when he was putting hand towards me

01:08.554 --> 01:11.533
and he was amazed how the wall became black!

01:13.719 --> 01:16.663
Then you have seen also that the flame reacts:

01:18.241 --> 01:26.300
if my photograph is there then you definitely awaken that flame,

01:26.300 --> 01:29.163
because so many have been cured through my photograph.

01:29.213 --> 01:31.663
How it has happened?

01:33.314 --> 01:38.005
What happens is that, when my photograph is placed,

01:38.005 --> 01:42.263
and you put the flame there, the flame gets awakened,

01:42.627 --> 01:47.049
and the light that passes through that flame

01:47.130 --> 01:51.029
carries the vibrations over.

01:51.029 --> 01:56.852
Material things carry [my vibrations], like sound.

01:56.939 --> 01:58.760
Now sound waves, you have seen that,

01:58.800 --> 02:04.479
I get can clear you out by touching my different chakras.

02:04.479 --> 02:07.538
Like today, I tried to clear you out on your Hamsa,

02:07.605 --> 02:11.870
by touching this mic.

02:11.870 --> 02:15.863
And on the Right Side there was a problem
so then I touched it to the right side.

02:15.953 --> 02:19.905
The vibrations were so much that it was making a sound! On the left side it was not.

02:19.986 --> 02:22.713
Then the problem of the fear on the left side

02:22.713 --> 02:24.264
was just the other way around.

02:24.344 --> 02:28.395
So even sound carries the vibrations.

02:28.395 --> 02:32.863
For example, what is a mantra, is nothing but a proper pocket,

02:32.863 --> 02:36.340
or you can say a pot, which carries the vibrations.

02:36.340 --> 02:38.997
But unless until you are a realised-soul,

02:39.037 --> 02:43.569
you cannot awaken the mantras.

02:43.649 --> 02:48.144
So to say mantras before the Realisation like mad is wrong.

02:48.184 --> 02:54.073
Now doing trataka with the photograph, is all right,

02:54.153 --> 02:56.081
there’s nothing wrong,

02:56.161 --> 03:00.730
but paying so much attention in one centre is not necessary.

03:05.809 --> 03:07.991
Supposing there’s a photograph

03:08.038 --> 03:12.276
and you are trying to look at the flame

03:12.541 --> 03:14.606
in front of the photograph,

03:14.687 --> 03:17.415
then you are paying more attention to the flame

03:17.488 --> 03:18.932
and not to the photograph.

03:19.038 --> 03:22.123
On the contrary if you pay attention to the photograph,

03:22.191 --> 03:26.598
the flame puts the light to the photograph,

03:26.692 --> 03:29.963
and you get complete vibrations.

03:30.213 --> 03:36.463
Especially for people who suffer, say, from the Right Side,

03:36.647 --> 03:40.163
for them heat is not good so much,

03:40.648 --> 03:42.863
because they are already heated up.

03:43.341 --> 03:47.363
To such people if they try to take treatment from heat side,

03:47.363 --> 03:49.792
they won’t be helped.

03:50.179 --> 03:54.098
They have to take vibrations from something that is cold,

03:54.098 --> 04:00.751
like water and salt; water and salt helps many people.

04:01.171 --> 04:03.715
But some people it may not help also, possibly:

04:03.715 --> 04:12.463
those who have very, very cold types of temperament,

04:12.544 --> 04:15.172
Left-Sided people.
It might not help those people.

04:15.212 --> 04:18.571
If they use a warm water it may help.

04:18.711 --> 04:23.303
So, [it] depends on what sort of personality you are.

04:23.410 --> 04:26.816
For people who are very heated up: one may not take too hot water;

04:26.896 --> 04:30.163
you should take cooler water.

04:33.440 --> 04:37.063
The main thing is that, once you are Realised,

04:37.295 --> 04:41.071
then you can touch the principle of everything,

04:41.151 --> 04:44.310
the tattwa, tattwa of everything.

04:44.377 --> 04:47.929
Like if you have to treat the tree,

04:48.489 --> 04:54.660
you cannot treat individual petals or individual leaves,

04:54.974 --> 04:56.158
even branches.

04:56.158 --> 04:59.134
But what you have to go into is the sap.

04:59.134 --> 05:01.268
And the sap is the principle.

05:01.341 --> 05:05.434
Now to get to the sap you have to use the water.

05:05.684 --> 05:09.894
So whatever medicine you have to give to the tree,

05:09.980 --> 05:12.206
what you have to do is to mix it up in the water,

05:12.206 --> 05:20.334
pour that water inside so the water inside the sap

05:20.451 --> 05:24.568
sucks it and manifests itself.

05:24.568 --> 05:28.971
In the same way, when you are Realised you become the principle.
