00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.830
The other day I talked to you about the left side

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:12.090
power that we have by which vedas are

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:19.799
In Sahaja yoga language. We call it as mahakali power and this power gives

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.580
Us the left side which is our subconscious

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.680
And his subconscious which gives us the conditioning

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:32.519
through our subconscious only

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:40.050
We become conditioned now how does our subconscious takes the condition?

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:54.330
in between the thought there's a very little space which we can call as the silence as

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.389
The present but the thought that comes to you rises and falls off

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:08.669
Stops for a while and again another thought starts and fall so the first thought that rises

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:17.550
We can see the rising of the thought not the falling of it, and when it falls it goes into the subconscious

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:28.140
Another one also rises it rises and again it falls it goes into the subconscious that's how our subconscious starts building up

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.950
How do the thoughts come into us?

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.170
Thought comes to us

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.840
because human beings

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.770
when they look at the thing

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.060
They have a method of projecting their mind into

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.690
if you have got a

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.610
Blackboard I can tell you how it happens. Can you lose wipe it off?

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:10.869
We wanted to talk about this subject, but rather complicated, but we have to somehow other face it sometimes in life

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:40.359
He started the video in my darkest then rolls out with the flat surface

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.750
Rising like that

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.250
enya

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.400
Now this one is going down

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:44.000
This chair, Sora if I got a knock attached to it. I see it just as a

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:52.669
But before realization to me. This is a pleasure

00:07:53.669 --> 00:07:55.500
This is my position

00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:57.500
this is my room and

00:07:57.870 --> 00:07:59.870
this one is a

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:03.380
Emblem of some sort of my greatness, whatever it is

00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:11.150
All these ideas come to me, then I give you a little sister that this picked up sir conditioning factor

00:08:28.289 --> 00:08:30.289
outside

00:08:36.419 --> 00:08:43.579
So the use measures this this of course is us

00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:55.550
Immediately I say what I?

00:08:57.450 --> 00:09:00.739
Really won so are you obliging? God redeem yourself?

00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:05.599
for us understand

00:09:08.339 --> 00:09:11.279
What is this when I come out it is?

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:17.489
But then position starts moving. It's really that we started with only according cover

00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:22.529
for example Indian God my family

00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:49.350
to

00:09:54.189 --> 00:09:56.189
understand stress

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:31.250
Now pertaining to our chicken also we use the same method that

00:11:35.129 --> 00:11:39.259
I think first starts with I think

00:11:41.189 --> 00:11:43.219
Whatever, you think is not God

00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:46.430
because if you could think

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:48.449
Then he is not God

00:11:48.449 --> 00:11:50.449
This is the absolute logic

00:11:51.269 --> 00:11:53.269
He is too great that

00:11:53.939 --> 00:11:55.939
You could think about?

00:11:57.329 --> 00:12:04.729
You can only become one with it. It would be like a little bird trying to fathom the ocean

00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:13.409
Now when we start over ck

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:18.090
We come here with our conditionings

00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:21.690
and the subconscious

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:27.749
Today, I am talking about conscious not so much a fever but called subconscious because I started talking on subconscious

00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:34.770
It's still there and the worst part of the subconscious is the worst of all is

00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:42.150
That if the personality is a oriented then for him the subconscious is the most important

00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:49.200
Such a person becomes a very obstinate Seeker very obstinate

00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:56.340
He will start judging a person according to one's subconscious for example

00:12:56.340 --> 00:13:03.359
I don't like I will become judgmental. I don't like such a person no why oh I just don't like

00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:11.849
Then the ego comes in to explain it saying that oh bust be something wrong with that person which I've felt through my spirit I

00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:15.630
Mean spirit you have not reached as it. No, not it. We must accept

00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:18.910
Sergeyeva is not a make-believe

00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:20.910
It is absolutely

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:23.160
Down-To-Earth truth

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:28.859
You cannot believe that oh, I am spiritually all right yes. Yes. I've got it. I felt very much better. I

00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:32.910
Felt very much matter is not the way to look at at your seeking

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:41.400
And when the ego becomes in charge of that

00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:47.429
subconscious, then seeking is very difficult

00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:55.200
because he goes start deciding everything you start judging everything with ego and

00:13:56.890 --> 00:13:59.939
Subconscious is such a dubious thing very dubious

00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:06.990
Now I would say freud did work on the subconscious area

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:11.310
He did work on the subconscious. Yes. Do you want something?

00:14:12.490 --> 00:14:14.520
Yeah, it's all right all right

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:17.749
It is a very dubious

00:14:19.049 --> 00:14:21.049
thing within us

00:14:22.499 --> 00:14:26.719
say somebody's mother has got green eyes the

00:14:28.709 --> 00:14:30.948
Boy will be fascinated by cleaners

00:14:32.999 --> 00:14:34.999
supposing the mother is Modern and

00:14:36.149 --> 00:14:38.508
has got a bald head, but users say

00:14:39.239 --> 00:14:43.548
Great right, and if she doesn't change her wig much

00:14:44.669 --> 00:14:47.689
Then he may like a particular type of her way

00:14:48.359 --> 00:14:54.049
But if she said changes too much he may like a belated woman, you can't say

00:14:56.669 --> 00:15:01.098
So the subconscious works out with such

00:15:02.609 --> 00:15:04.609
Transistor things

00:15:04.949 --> 00:15:06.949
But to get it fixed also

00:15:08.489 --> 00:15:14.779
Is a difficult thing and when it is fixed to remove it is even more difficult

00:15:18.929 --> 00:15:24.679
Some people become routine us in their nature absolutely routine as they've walked like blind

00:15:25.949 --> 00:15:27.869
They get up early in the morning

00:15:27.869 --> 00:15:31.939
They take their tea the newspaper has to be there if newspaper is not there

00:15:32.789 --> 00:15:34.229
they

00:15:34.229 --> 00:15:37.309
Cannot do anything the whole day newspaper. They must read I

00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:40.489
Mean it's good that we don't read newspapers

00:15:41.939 --> 00:15:45.649
But he can't live without it. So he must have his newspaper before him

00:15:45.649 --> 00:15:52.158
He takes his newspaper and the counted number of sips he'll take of the tea then he'll go into the bathroom with

00:15:52.379 --> 00:15:54.379
counted number of steps

00:15:55.259 --> 00:16:00.438
We'll take the bar. The same way absolutely the nail cutter here. This there there there. He just walks like this

00:16:03.359 --> 00:16:06.408
Absolutely joyless lifeless life he leads

00:16:07.949 --> 00:16:09.949
It's a routine

00:16:11.159 --> 00:16:13.159
Another person is a topsy-Turvy

00:16:15.029 --> 00:16:16.799
both the Extremes

00:16:16.799 --> 00:16:22.069
Come from our subconscious. If person is very routine us and meticulous. He could be a very bad a day

00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:28.100
He's a very unpopular person. He gives us a headache because he's used to a ridiculous thing

00:16:28.279 --> 00:16:31.338
He makes everybody meticulous. He wants everybody to be meticulous

00:16:31.339 --> 00:16:35.119
If somebody is not meticulous then he gets after the life of that person

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:38.359
And I have seen some people if they say it's such a person coming in the morning

00:16:38.610 --> 00:16:41.029
They run away and have a bad thing India

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:48.559
Miserly ness also comes from such habits all such headaches come from subconscious

00:16:48.899 --> 00:16:54.739
But to them because they have their ego they said no, I am not miserly. I'm economical

00:16:55.740 --> 00:17:00.859
You go finds out words. You see to make something ugly look very nice and

00:17:01.439 --> 00:17:07.548
This is how we start off looking after our subconscious and nourishing. It nicely it's coming up

00:17:11.429 --> 00:17:13.429
We do not want to face ourselves

00:17:14.069 --> 00:17:18.649
Even before realization he can face herself that why are we so abnormal?

00:17:19.860 --> 00:17:21.860
Why everyone calls me a boy?

00:17:23.189 --> 00:17:25.189
No, one likes my company I

00:17:26.339 --> 00:17:33.678
Have to assert myself too much to be in the company of others there is no magnetism left in me. What's the matter?

00:17:34.649 --> 00:17:36.649
Why?

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:43.549
Why that people do not want me? Why they want to get rid of me?

00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:47.030
But here is something oh

00:17:47.669 --> 00:17:53.929
Good for nothing. I am such a higher personality. I am such as such I am a person of taste and this and that and

00:17:55.049 --> 00:18:00.889
Such people can end up with dogs or maybe some cats. I don't know they some of them end up with even snakes

00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:04.520
not with human beings

00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:10.549
The subconscious has so many problems which freud has brought

00:18:12.659 --> 00:18:18.648
Forward and said that this is the subconscious subconscious, but he was such a limited man, and how big person

00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:21.710
that he himself suffered from all the

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:25.339
Patients who came to him and he got all their diseases

00:18:26.250 --> 00:18:29.179
Really he become a case of complete Materia, Medica

00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:32.750
so whatever he has said has

00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:41.030
Definitely helped us to see how many varieties of subconscious attacks. We can have but at the same time

00:18:42.809 --> 00:18:44.809
He has given us no solutions

00:18:45.299 --> 00:18:50.268
And he has made us very one-sided that is do not allow yourself to be conditioned

00:18:51.179 --> 00:18:53.209
Do not allow yourself to be conditioned

00:18:57.360 --> 00:18:59.990
Now when we say like that our subconscious

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:03.829
May not be very much more

00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:07.010
But the other side is even worse

00:19:07.559 --> 00:19:09.918
The other side is a terrible

00:19:13.409 --> 00:19:15.409
absolutely terrorizing

00:19:16.169 --> 00:19:18.169
Thing called Mr.. Ego

00:19:18.899 --> 00:19:20.899
if that develops

00:19:21.090 --> 00:19:23.269
Then there is no end to our nonsense

00:19:24.419 --> 00:19:29.148
Then you become nothing, but I like a stick. You know anybody comes there. He knows you are that

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:36.470
So what to do is the problem the dilemma?

00:19:37.559 --> 00:19:41.569
Before people is what to do if you get rid of your subconscious?

00:19:42.659 --> 00:19:46.609
Then you will get your supra-conscious me in the sense that you start planning for the future

00:19:48.539 --> 00:19:52.638
Then what's wrong? What's wrong the family system breaks out the

00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:57.439
Sinfulness is accepted. There is no righteousness in life

00:19:58.019 --> 00:20:00.019
Nobody can talk of righteousness

00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:03.360
There's no

00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:05.010
worry about

00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:09.679
What you are doing to the society or to yourself? What's wrong? If I am doing like that?

00:20:09.679 --> 00:20:13.398
What's wrong goes on like so the other side of its?

00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:20.840
Now the first side subconscious gives you

00:20:22.889 --> 00:20:24.889
the deadliest

00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:27.740
disease called cancer

00:20:29.159 --> 00:20:31.159
cancer comes from the subconscious area

00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:41.039
Not from supra-Conscious but from supra-Conscious. You development diseases like heart paralysis

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000
diabetes

00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:53.189
Cancer is developed because your subconscious is

00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:57.250
overloaded

00:20:57.250 --> 00:20:59.550
It will work out through ego doesn't matter

00:21:01.059 --> 00:21:03.059
means

00:21:03.610 --> 00:21:05.610
you

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:13.050
Create an emergency within yourself if you create an emergency within your physical mental emotional any kind of an emergency

00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:20.759
Means you are loading your subconscious for example. I go on rubbing this finger

00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:25.170
All my life is this there are people funny funny. Type. We have there are some called chains

00:21:25.170 --> 00:21:27.300
You know I don't know if you have heard about them

00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:33.510
in their religion

00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:40.290
They are not supposed to use any razor. I don't know why they are specially against razors. You know absolutely

00:21:41.290 --> 00:21:46.829
So you have to pluck your hair or from all over with your own hand

00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:53.939
They go on plucking their hair because they are not supposed to cut it you cannot use razors can imagine

00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:56.670
that extreme is the truth, so

00:21:57.670 --> 00:21:59.670
They're gone plucking like this all the time

00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:04.949
And even if I have lost all their hair still there will be going on like that

00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:10.170
This can develop an emergency in the different muscles in two different hats

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:18.840
Anything can develop an emergency like as you suggested last time that if you put a metal in the body it develops an emergency

00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:28.289
Just if you introduce a metal as soon as an emergency is created the subconscious starts

00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:31.200
Wriggling

00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:33.240
pumping expanding

00:22:34.179 --> 00:22:41.909
When the subconscious starts expanding then we move to the left hand side the movement to the left hand side

00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:45.390
gives us

00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:51.190
very

00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:54.830
dangerous

00:22:54.830 --> 00:22:56.830
position

00:22:57.530 --> 00:23:02.889
Because in the left hand side is the collective subconscious all that is dead

00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:06.009
Since your creation since your creation

00:23:06.010 --> 00:23:08.079
I'm again saying is all that

00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:15.459
all the kinds of vegetables that have gone out of circulation of evolution all the kinds of

00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:18.549
matter that have gone out of circulation

00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:21.250
all the kinds of

00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:29.800
You can say insects animals and the last human beings

00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:33.070
all that is dead exist in the

00:23:33.710 --> 00:23:37.540
Within ourselves within our being everything exists within us. We don't have to go outside

00:23:38.450 --> 00:23:40.450
So we get exposed to that?

00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:44.079
very dangerous area of subconscious

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:47.889
when it expands you may not be

00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:52.510
consciously

00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:57.639
Conditioning yourself for example people thought it is too much conditioning to wear

00:23:58.610 --> 00:24:02.680
The Gray suit or say the tails coats

00:24:03.290 --> 00:24:08.829
It may be too much, so they said all right let us take to another style of life, so they said oh

00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:10.880
This is all junk

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:12.880
Let's dress up in such a way

00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:15.400
that

00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:18.130
We look like nothing on Earth

00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:22.959
All right, this is an emergence

00:24:25.370 --> 00:24:28.900
Because you look so funny. You are to be attacked

00:24:32.550 --> 00:24:34.550
simple thing is

00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:41.690
say London is a place where you must walk with an umbrella actually play your hockey and also football with an umbrella and

00:24:43.050 --> 00:24:45.379
a person who walks without an umbrella

00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:49.070
during rain in London

00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:54.830
Has to get cold he may say oh, I don't care you see. I am not formal

00:24:56.430 --> 00:24:59.450
That's how the dress develops. That's how the attitudes develop

00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:04.129
Now he says I'm not going to be conditioned. No. I'm not going to get in Amri life

00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:09.200
It is raining doesn't matter. I am not going to have raincoat or anything any appendages like that you see

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:11.200
I'll just walk in my swimsuit

00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:14.060
He'll really swim through I tell it

00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:22.190
You just can't do it. You are a human being you are not a hippopotamus, but

00:25:25.110 --> 00:25:29.630
They want to be hippopotamus when they are human beings

00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:33.890
Because of he this is what it is either. We want to be monkeys

00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:36.860
Or we want to be tigers?

00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:39.110
Or we want to be liars?

00:25:40.050 --> 00:25:42.800
But we don't want to be human beings that we are

00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:50.570
Because of Mr.. Ego, which teaches you that you should be something different

00:25:54.900 --> 00:25:56.900
These things create an emergency

00:25:57.870 --> 00:25:59.430
and

00:25:59.430 --> 00:26:01.430
these emergencies

00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:04.580
Lead us into areas which are very dangerous

00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:13.069
Like I would say there's a fire supposing in the other who all right. It's an emergency created all right?

00:26:13.530 --> 00:26:18.019
what happens that when the fire is there we get so frightened we enter into another place and

00:26:18.750 --> 00:26:22.010
From fire to frying pan we may land up into something else

00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:26.720
so to be normal

00:26:27.330 --> 00:26:31.129
To be in the Centre as buddha said to lead a normal life

00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:34.219
And not to be unique and abnormal

00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:39.979
Sometimes they do it just to create a nuisance value that people should be able to see your faces

00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:42.349
That's why some people walk with red hair

00:26:47.429 --> 00:26:53.298
All Sorts of things people do be normal in the center

00:26:55.049 --> 00:26:58.339
And to do that, you don't have to do anything you

00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:06.770
Are born a normal person lead a normal life? I mean if you are abnormally handicapped or anything

00:27:06.770 --> 00:27:13.069
That's a different point but even normal people behave like that like this. You're grouchy and all those things that you do

00:27:13.070 --> 00:27:16.130
I mean you have got hands feet everything. Thank God for that

00:27:16.799 --> 00:27:20.779
After sometime you find a person without one name what I was in robbery

00:27:22.049 --> 00:27:24.288
begging on the street with a violin in the hand

00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:28.280
all these

00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:31.579
subconscious problems come to us and

00:27:32.159 --> 00:27:36.139
Stick to us because of her ego if you do not identify ourselves with this

00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:41.539
Subconscious and say no no nothing this is not important it comes from very small ideas

00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:48.979
Like I can tell you about Indians very well because I have seen it very clearly they're very particular about

00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:51.080
Washing their hands having their baths

00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:55.939
They must have a bath every day. Can you believe it anyone in England I?

00:27:59.429 --> 00:28:01.429
Am not getting so I can tell you

00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:08.719
And then take a bath in the morning, and then go to their work, they don't feel all right without that

00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:10.720
They don't feel all right you see this is the point

00:28:11.970 --> 00:28:15.260
And they died of lung cancer in this country

00:28:17.370 --> 00:28:22.370
Day in and day out day in and day out for years together. Oh, I never catch cold nothing happens to me

00:28:22.370 --> 00:28:27.140
I am very happy and suddenly you find they get a very galloping type of a cancer

00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:32.659
So we have to know that we live in a nature in a country in a place

00:28:32.669 --> 00:28:38.569
We have to adjust our body to that. We must respect that we must respect that nature and not to fight it

00:28:39.179 --> 00:28:43.639
Like we are modern people except that we live with these machines and things like that

00:28:44.159 --> 00:28:51.799
What's the use of growing your hair like a primitive man? You cannot go you cannot exist as you exist in

00:28:52.679 --> 00:28:54.679
Dense forests of Amazon cut it

00:28:55.860 --> 00:29:03.579
we create such emergencies for our by doing these extra special things that that tells upon our

00:29:05.119 --> 00:29:08.919
subconscious, and we become very much prone to cancer I

00:29:11.179 --> 00:29:13.179
Mean I would say that

00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:18.460
People can develop cancer from a small thing like you have got those people who announce

00:29:19.609 --> 00:29:22.059
His excellency such-And-such coming

00:29:22.969 --> 00:29:26.289
He may find after sometimes he becomes his excellency in the throat

00:29:27.349 --> 00:29:29.349
It is possible. Oh

00:29:29.869 --> 00:29:32.738
We're doing it all the time doing the same thing

00:29:35.509 --> 00:29:39.608
Shaking hands now. I mean sometimes really we shake hands with six hundred and

00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:45.369
Seventy eighty people Iii do that. I think you know what's about to happen just

00:29:46.279 --> 00:29:48.279
On shaking hands with you

00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:50.059
Change it a little bit

00:29:50.059 --> 00:29:54.248
Now it has been on from I don't know charge the third or whatever it was

00:29:54.440 --> 00:30:01.659
It's still on its own in our country same way in England and all these you see habit formations like that that

00:30:01.999 --> 00:30:03.999
everybody must

00:30:04.849 --> 00:30:07.539
conform to that subconscious I

00:30:09.529 --> 00:30:14.348
Mean sometimes for a change let us say like this sometimes she can sometimes walk about no

00:30:14.690 --> 00:30:17.499
Is the same form on and on and on?

00:30:18.739 --> 00:30:23.108
But I am not against addition by any chance for that. I must say

00:30:24.109 --> 00:30:26.829
The traditions which are real traditions are

00:30:27.950 --> 00:30:29.950
always helpful

00:30:32.029 --> 00:30:38.409
But traditions. Which are just mechanical for example paying respect to elders

00:30:41.119 --> 00:30:43.119
paying respect to a saint

00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:49.839
Now these days of course you can get saints by the reasons see if you pay five pounds you can get a seat

00:30:50.629 --> 00:30:56.019
Standing there to take over some more money from you, so you can get saint Sensei inside Saints, but still

00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:59.200
All such traditions

00:31:01.279 --> 00:31:04.358
Which makes you sublime a higher personality?

00:31:06.990 --> 00:31:08.990
They are helpful to life

00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:11.360
when I say that

00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:13.640
Subconscious is not to be nourished

00:31:14.820 --> 00:31:16.230
and

00:31:16.230 --> 00:31:22.159
Is to be looked after that I do not mean by any chance that you give up your good tradition

00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:27.469
so there are some bad things and there are some good things that we need and

00:31:30.930 --> 00:31:36.500
The good things we no need are source of Zara's are called as good

00:31:37.170 --> 00:31:38.310
conditionings

00:31:38.310 --> 00:31:44.870
There is no word in English like soup, but shoe means the one which is good for your spirit

00:31:47.790 --> 00:31:51.649
So the samskaras are the conditionings that are good for you

00:31:52.980 --> 00:31:59.839
Outright rejection of the complete subconscious is as stupid as outright

00:32:01.470 --> 00:32:09.409
Cancellation of your supra-conscious you have to balance you have to keep a balanced life between the two

00:32:12.090 --> 00:32:18.169
Now when they break traditions they break it so much so hard that the whole set society muskrat of them

00:32:19.590 --> 00:32:21.590
Can't you do it little bit?

00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:25.220
Must you crack down

00:32:25.350 --> 00:32:27.350
everything and

00:32:27.690 --> 00:32:31.340
That is how another kind of emergency settles in in Society?

00:32:31.890 --> 00:32:33.120
now today

00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:36.019
Which is the emergency which is the worst of all for?

00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:39.589
Which you are not aware of I think you people are not aware in the west

00:32:39.690 --> 00:32:44.509
Which is the worst of all emergency that is settling in in?

00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:48.350
Every human being is a sense of insecurity

00:32:52.020 --> 00:32:54.710
Your media's they blast you every morning

00:32:57.270 --> 00:32:59.420
You start feeling? What's happening shucks?

00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:04.020
Anywhere you go?

00:33:04.020 --> 00:33:08.509
You find oh, God this disaster that disaster. They never talk of

00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:11.120
Anything that will give you peace?

00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:16.220
Tranquility that will console you make you happy you go home

00:33:16.710 --> 00:33:20.510
Your wife chorus with you with such an emergency what oh?

00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:26.720
The tap is out of gear, and you never did this you didn't do that. You don't know that

00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:31.939
it could reverse you were salmon wife means husband husband means wife but

00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:40.550
the emergencies we create for others do we understand that we are creating cancer for others do we a

00:33:42.090 --> 00:33:45.860
Man marries a woman just see this is very subtle one has to understand

00:33:49.290 --> 00:33:51.290
And then he says oh

00:33:52.140 --> 00:33:52.910
What's wrong?

00:33:52.910 --> 00:34:00.709
I'm just friendly with someone like that he flirts with other women he has a key for something the woman develops insecurity within herself and

00:34:01.770 --> 00:34:03.770
she develops a

00:34:05.490 --> 00:34:07.490
horrible disease called as

00:34:08.670 --> 00:34:10.670
breast cancer

00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:19.460
The insecurities that develop within us if they are carried too far by us you see by people who think oh

00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:23.059
God how insecure I am I had to overcome that

00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:30.290
They end up their lives in the pubs and things like that and think that they can get rid of their problems are even worse

00:34:32.850 --> 00:34:34.850
much more vulnerable

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:41.180
Those who try to escape the truth and go into subconscious more like you see here?

00:34:41.970 --> 00:34:48.049
There's an emergency if somebody runs into this room their safety, but supposing you run into scotland yard

00:34:49.470 --> 00:34:51.470
What will happen?

00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:57.380
it's like that then emergency develops if you

00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:01.770
try to run

00:35:01.770 --> 00:35:04.940
You might land up into very very serious trouble

00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:07.170
face it

00:35:07.170 --> 00:35:10.639
If your husband husband is misbehaving get after him

00:35:11.730 --> 00:35:14.809
Tell him this won't work out you have to be a faithful man

00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:21.170
Nothing doing and you see to that woman that she gets up you were to three stops doesn't matter she deserves it

00:35:21.170 --> 00:35:23.269
She has no business to Meddle with your married life

00:35:24.210 --> 00:35:32.149
If the wife feels like that slap her nicely she has no business to be infertile to solve the problem

00:35:32.830 --> 00:35:34.830
but do not be a

00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:39.150
Person, oh, I don't want to say anything let it be now. He's in love

00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:42.989
Blow off such loves and things which creates problems

00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:48.420
Just whoa and finish up all these nonsensical things these creates

00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:52.080
horrible emergencies

00:35:52.540 --> 00:35:55.680
for men and women the worst of all for children

00:36:00.130 --> 00:36:07.529
We need peace human beings have to live in peace. They are beautifully made they are made

00:36:08.860 --> 00:36:11.610
With such care that delicate beings

00:36:12.460 --> 00:36:14.460
They're not to be hurt

00:36:15.130 --> 00:36:17.130
They're not to be tortured

00:36:17.350 --> 00:36:19.350
They are not to be trouble

00:36:19.570 --> 00:36:23.489
Try to be kind to them if the parents are not kind to the children

00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:29.159
If a person does not have his parents in childhood. He is a volcanic personality

00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:38.009
You have to be very very kind to other people and nice to them

00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:43.050
Do not create emergencies in their lives

00:36:44.530 --> 00:36:47.280
If you create emergencies in their lives you

00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:50.160
Are responsible?

00:36:50.380 --> 00:36:51.910
for

00:36:51.910 --> 00:36:54.119
their troubles and their diseases

00:36:56.950 --> 00:37:03.179
One must realize that human being is the most delicate thing that God has created so far

00:37:08.590 --> 00:37:09.760
when

00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:13.020
You really love human beings as a whole

00:37:13.990 --> 00:37:15.990
You must realize this

00:37:16.090 --> 00:37:20.459
And you'll be amazed. How we handle each other the way we shout

00:37:21.970 --> 00:37:23.970
The way we scream at others

00:37:24.700 --> 00:37:29.729
There's no delicacy of handling of other people, and that's why as I said

00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:33.239
that if you are unpopular for your meticulous nature

00:37:34.090 --> 00:37:36.120
or for your over a

00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:38.050
30 or

00:37:38.050 --> 00:37:42.989
For your ego, you must know that you are creating an emergency for others

00:37:45.220 --> 00:37:47.459
Even might give you a satisfaction. Oh

00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:53.249
I've done a ride. That's what I have done him right? It's good for him. Let him have it

00:37:55.210 --> 00:37:58.290
But there is God above us who will judge us?

00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:04.979
But when we talk of the subconscious you see we suddenly go into extreme sub that goes

00:38:05.710 --> 00:38:10.379
Something human beings are always to be saved don't go to myself supposing you fall this side

00:38:10.380 --> 00:38:13.109
You fall or you go that side and fall you fall isn't

00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:20.970
is it that when you come this side you do not fall on that side you fall so both the sides if you move

00:38:21.550 --> 00:38:23.550
Go to Extremes you fall

00:38:25.030 --> 00:38:29.820
So both the sides must be saved, and that's why I must warn you before I

00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:34.410
Stop this lecture that when we go too much to the subconscious

00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:40.530
And we worry too much about the subconscious, then what happens. Oh

00:38:43.930 --> 00:38:46.980
Don't say anything let him do what he likes

00:38:47.620 --> 00:38:52.380
He is doing anything. I should say anything. Why should we be harsh to them?

00:38:54.850 --> 00:38:56.140
and

00:38:56.140 --> 00:38:58.140
We should not hurt

00:38:58.150 --> 00:39:01.410
After all whatever is Dean doing. He's all right

00:39:01.810 --> 00:39:08.759
Do not hurt him even a murderer comes before you oh, please please don't say anything to him now. He's not a murderer this

00:39:10.450 --> 00:39:12.450
This is going to another side

00:39:14.020 --> 00:39:17.219
This is called a sky Valley in Sanskrit in Which

00:39:20.260 --> 00:39:24.270
People give up their weapons like Arjuna did

00:39:26.590 --> 00:39:29.189
Arjuna was a disciple of Shri, Krishna

00:39:30.580 --> 00:39:32.580
Just like my disciples here, you know

00:39:33.820 --> 00:39:40.859
He was also there, and when the war came, I mean he was a great warrior till the war started

00:39:42.250 --> 00:39:45.449
When the war started he said oh, Krishna

00:39:46.510 --> 00:39:52.169
What's the use of killing these they are my brothers my sisters my teacher my revered?

00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:58.299
Elders, how can I kill them just a piece of land I?

00:40:00.110 --> 00:40:04.239
cannot kill them he gets into that subconscious mode and

00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:08.590
On this base was based Krishna's philosophy

00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:11.720
Those who can read?

00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:14.350
Through the Lines can see that he tried to establish

00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:24.280
That this kind of a non-violence of a pure poor person of a week is no non-violence

00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:27.339
It is covetous is Cavalia

00:40:28.010 --> 00:40:29.570
even

00:40:29.570 --> 00:40:31.719
the non-violence of Arjuna is

00:40:32.450 --> 00:40:34.450
Cowardice

00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:37.780
For he said who is killed?

00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:41.680
Your spirit is never killed

00:40:42.410 --> 00:40:44.410
but for the religious

00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:46.610
establishment

00:40:46.610 --> 00:40:48.610
religious doesn't mean I mean the

00:40:48.920 --> 00:40:53.379
Wars of Roses and all that I mean the religion within yourself

00:40:55.550 --> 00:41:00.729
for standing up for the truth of any cause

00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:04.520
is

00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:06.820
the war of DhArma is the war of

00:41:07.220 --> 00:41:13.149
Sustainers that sustains the society so you have to rise against all such things you know to fight it

00:41:13.550 --> 00:41:16.330
because if you fight for that

00:41:16.850 --> 00:41:18.850
You get your Moksha

00:41:20.420 --> 00:41:23.500
And if you live people will call it victorious

00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:28.540
It is a very balancing factor

00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:36.909
Like many people tell me I mean I have told me many a times also that mother why do you criticize the fake gurus?

00:41:37.490 --> 00:41:39.490
What should I do should I garland them?

00:41:44.950 --> 00:41:49.619
These are horrible devils who were born before also and were killed by goddess

00:41:50.260 --> 00:41:55.289
And today I see them so clearly and should I go and say oh you great people

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:00.000
What should I do?

00:42:02.049 --> 00:42:05.369
Krishna said that whenever there is

00:42:07.900 --> 00:42:15.539
Fall-off sustainers yada yada. Hi Dharmasya Glanir Bhavati, but when it goes down the righteousness

00:42:16.539 --> 00:42:18.539
falls off

00:42:19.359 --> 00:42:25.139
Then V-notch others come to hell to destroy

00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:28.470
these horrible negative forces

00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:37.409
But it truong, Iassogna to save and to sustain

00:42:39.099 --> 00:42:44.909
The Saints some baba me you gave me I come in every age in human form

00:42:48.940 --> 00:42:50.589
It was christ

00:42:50.589 --> 00:42:52.739
Who on the cross said that forgive them?

00:42:52.869 --> 00:42:55.199
Father for they do not know what they're doing

00:42:55.200 --> 00:43:01.379
And the same one took a hunter and hit these people hard when they were making money in the name of God

00:43:02.170 --> 00:43:06.359
We never see the balancing factor in life. That's typical of human beings

00:43:07.210 --> 00:43:10.949
If they go on to one side, they'll go on two months if they go on to another either

00:43:10.950 --> 00:43:14.909
they'll become Hitler's or they'll become some sort of I

00:43:18.309 --> 00:43:23.519
Don't know what to call them some sort of people who are who have no backbone nothing?

00:43:24.819 --> 00:43:26.819
damages

00:43:27.220 --> 00:43:31.649
You are human beings and a human being has to be in the center

00:43:34.059 --> 00:43:35.289
and

00:43:35.289 --> 00:43:40.829
This is what always I try to tell you that when I talk about subconscious I

00:43:41.410 --> 00:43:46.770
Want you to have the balancing thing and this comes to you through wisdom of sahaja yoga

00:43:48.220 --> 00:43:53.010
Because when you get your realization you get the vibrations flowing in the hand

00:43:53.740 --> 00:43:59.640
And you can find out when you lose your vibrations because the time you are losing your balance

00:44:01.090 --> 00:44:06.029
This cool this cool breeze starts flowing through you is manifesting the holy ghost within you

00:44:07.090 --> 00:44:11.819
This is the brahma Shakti and that such as so you are going to -?

00:44:13.180 --> 00:44:17.159
But sahaja Yogi's special in England are very intelligent people

00:44:17.830 --> 00:44:20.700
Especially London there even extra intelligent

00:44:21.910 --> 00:44:24.029
They make a politics out of sahaja yoga

00:44:26.260 --> 00:44:28.260
It's nice to be in politics

00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:34.589
So that they claim oh, we are communists. We are this we are that

00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:45.360
you
