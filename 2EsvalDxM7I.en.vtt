00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.114
So one has to understand that today's message

00:00:14.234 --> 00:00:19.682
is that we inculcate purity.

00:00:19.802 --> 00:00:24.120
We should not cheat ourselves. It is easy to cheat

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.815
but we should inculcate purity

00:00:27.935 --> 00:00:34.952
within ourselves as a matter of our own maturity,

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.120
as our own decoration, as our own beauty

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:46.156
and not just because it's a laborious thing

00:00:46.276 --> 00:00:50.364
or it is a very hard thing, not like that.

00:00:51.165 --> 00:00:55.240
It should be achieved with great pleasure and happiness.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.004
How do we like to have a bath or to be clean

00:00:59.124 --> 00:01:01.320
and to be presentable?

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.360
In the same way we should try to clean our thoughts.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.560
Just by paying attention to them, we can clean them.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.240
Thoughts must be made clean.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.160
First of all why have thoughts at all.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.080
But even if you have, have clean and pure thoughts.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.400
Even if you have to have, don't have thoughts

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.880
full of arrogance, aggression or of fear.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.426
Some people think that if you have thoughts of fear

00:01:30.466 --> 00:01:34.120
it's a very good thing: "Oh I'm frightened, I am afraid."

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.440
It's impurity. Why should you be afraid?

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.040
That means your left Vishuddhi is catching.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.920
There's no need to have any fear of any kind;

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.607
no need to have any fear of any kind.

00:01:47.727 --> 00:01:53.160
If you have to have fear that means there's something wrong.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.080
If you believe that God is above all,

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.080
you are a realized soul and that

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.920
God is going to look after you,

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.000
that He is your father,

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.440
that He's open His gates to you,

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.600
what is there to be afraid of?

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.080
Many people think that way that if you have the fears,

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.676
you are humble. Humility is different

00:02:15.796 --> 00:02:17.960
from a frightened person.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.400
It's absolutely a [INAUDIBLE] it has nothing to do with humility.

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.480
So to be humble is different

00:02:26.868 --> 00:02:29.440
and to be frightened is different.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.080
For Sahaja Yogis it is very easy to find out

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.960
through their vibratory awareness

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.160
what is fear and what is humility.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.360
As humility will give you vibrations

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.560
and fear will catch all your left side.

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:57.360
So our purification of our mind comes

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.560
through certain methods of understanding ourselves.

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.120
First of the understandings one has to have

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:22.960
is that we are born in a family, born in a society,

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.360
born in a so-called religious sect or what.

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.560
So all these fixations

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:35.520
have put into us certain amount of impurities.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:41.153
Which may give us ego, superego, anything it might give us.

00:03:41.273 --> 00:03:46.273
So to keep it pure and simple is:

00:03:46.942 --> 00:03:50.696
take to water element as much as you can.

00:03:50.816 --> 00:03:54.804
It helps both ways, it helps ego, it helps superego.

00:03:54.924 --> 00:03:56.480
Take to water element.

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.480
And that is what Lakshmi is.

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:06.960
Lakshmi is the one that gives you the Mahalakshmi Tattwa.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.120
From the Lakshmi only the Mahalakshmi's principle comes in.

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:14.080
And this is after the purification

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.840
through the Lakshmi process.

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:17.120
Christ has said,

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:22.760
"If you want I can give you gold, gold parts,

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.520
you can live with it.

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:27.280
But those who love Me will only enter

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.400
into the Kingdom of God. And I will eat with them,"

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.960
means those who are pure only I will eat with them.

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.640
I will not eat with people, who are impure.

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.520
He was so, I mean, every,

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:45.720
all the incarnations are aware of it,

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.880
that they have to be with the pure people

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.800
and they have to help the pure people.

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:55.000
But He so clearly said it that if you want Lakshmi,

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:59.080
you can have it, that's money.

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.400
But that's not Mahalakshmi,

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.720
so from Lakshmi to Mahalakshmi state.

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:06.440
You've already got your realization,

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.840
you do not know how much you have got it already.

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.200
You are already having the Mahalakshmi principle within you.

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.600
And what is the Mahalakshmi principle?

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:20.400
That's the point. Can I ask this question?

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:30.000
What is the Mahalakshmi principle within you?

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:38.160
Yogi: It's all for the Spirit.

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:42.200
Shri Mataji: No, no. But you have a power.

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:47.520
You have got MahaLakshmi's powers within you, do you know that?

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:53.840
Yogi: The pleasure it gives you.

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.440
Shri Mataji: The pleasure? No, no, no.

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:59.120
Yogi: The power of giving realization.

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.080
Shri Mataji: Go ahead still, little more, more.

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:06.800
Pleasure is not a power.

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:09.200
Pleasure is what you enjoy.

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.200
But you have a power of Mahalakshmi.

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:18.320
Yogi: Sustaining power.

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:20.800
Shri Mataji: That's no power.

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:27.360
Power means, you have that power to do something.

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:34.760
Yogi: The power to spread Sahaja yoga.

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:38.560
Shri Mataji: That's rather vague, particular one.

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:43.400
Yogi: Power to give realization.

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:49.760
Yogi: To evolve.

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.320
Shri Mataji: But to evolve is your own.

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:57.240
Power is what you do to others.

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:01.080
The whole thing I told you just now.

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:05.000
Is to purify.

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:08.760
You have the power to purify.

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:12.840
How do you cure people?

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:16.640
By purifying them.

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:19.360
All right?

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:24.640
Now just think how you purify others,

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:30.880
by talking to others you can purify them.

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:35.840
By touching others, you can purify them.

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:39.960
By looking at them, you can purify them.

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:44.040
One person who is a realized soul, purifies the whole atmosphere.

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:46.880
The atmosphere is purified.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.680
Since I've come, it has been warm enough.

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:55.160
You purify everything.

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:59.840
You purify this light, do you notice that?

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:03.200
You've awakened the light.

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:10.800
Now what other powers you have?

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:19.840
Yogi: To raise the Kundalini.

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:22.040
Shri Mataji: That's awakening.

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:26.080
See Kundalini is many powers, is many-folded.

00:08:27.604 --> 00:08:32.560
You purify yourselves, others and yourselves.

00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:36.400
Some more powers are there. Now come along, let's have it.

00:08:38.017 --> 00:08:40.360
You all have those powers and you are not aware of them

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:44.680
this is the best part of it.

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:47.880
You can't follow it. Now let's have it.

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:57.840
Yogi: Power over time. Arranging time to suit yourselves.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
Shri Mataji: That's not a power of Mahalakshmi.

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:05.320
That's another one I'll tell you who does that.

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:20.240
Yogi: Balance. It gives balance between ego and superego?

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:22.840
Shri Mataji: That's true. That is one of them.

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:26.240
But that is guru power. That is the guru's power.

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:30.480
Balance comes from guru.

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:35.280
See Mahalakshmi is water, so now you tell Me.

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:37.080
Yogi: To cleanse

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:39.600
Shri Mataji: That's done now, the cleansing is done.

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:43.240
Water is water.

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:48.072
Yogi: Satisfied.

00:09:48.192 --> 00:09:51.512
Shri Mataji: Now coming to the part.

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:55.520
It quenches the thirst, the spiritual thirst.

00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:59.280
You can quench the spiritual thirst of people, tremendous power,

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:02.120
because when you give realization

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:06.920
that the seeking is over. All right?

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:09.640
Then another one now come along.

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:13.080
What other qualities?

00:10:14.694 --> 00:10:18.894
Think of the water,

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:26.120
nourishment, you nourish.

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:29.040
You give spiritual nourishment to people

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:31.680
through your power; even if you are standing there

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:34.840
you are nourishing others.

00:10:36.937 --> 00:10:40.480
Then it is a solvent,

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:44.272
you dissolve their ego and you dissolve their super ego.

00:10:44.392 --> 00:10:48.832
All these powers are you own after realization.

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:54.608
Just think of it. What else?

00:10:54.728 --> 00:10:58.640
Yogi: Divinity.

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:00.896
Shri Mataji: That's very vague

00:11:01.016 --> 00:11:05.200
because divinity is, how to relate it to water?

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:06.800
People won't understand it,

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:11.160
so let us put it other way round. What is it?

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:16.000
Yogi: cool down.

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:19.320
Shri Mataji: You become a cool down person.

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:26.920
Very good, very good.

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:32.320
You become cool, cool personality.

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:36.840
You have a cooling effect, what else?

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:40.520
Yogi: You carry others. You can carry others.

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:43.840
Shri Mataji: You can, very gentle

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:49.800
and also drown some of them.

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:56.000
Drown into the love, into the ocean of love, all right.

00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:59.520
But you can also push them

00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:02.040
with two running jumps, all right.

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:05.480
That also can be done.

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:11.200
It has another very great quality that water permeates

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:13.040
into the smallest particle.

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:14.600
It goes the roots,

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:17.960
I mean suck into the roots.

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:21.120
So Mahalakshmi power you just see the roots of the person.

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:23.800
You just know where the problem comes from,

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:27.320
just, actually it is the awareness,

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:29.360
it is the intelligence,

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:34.480
suck the truth part of it which gets enlightened.

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:37.400
And you understand that now where is the problem,

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:39.760
you just go near the root

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:43.280
and you suck and you can be easily sucked,

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:46.360
you permeate.

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:49.640
You see, when you are sitting near a person

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:52.000
then you tell Me, "Mother, this is catching at the back,

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:55.520
the person doesn't know." You have permeated.

00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:58.440
Your personality has permeated into that person. He doesn't know.

00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:00.480
You have permeated into that person

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:04.240
and you are feeling the roots, where is the problem.

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:06.840
The water is flowing into that being.

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:09.920
The divine water is flowing into that being

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:13.120
and the obstruction is felt

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:15.880
through that divine water

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.800
and you can say that this is catching that is catching.

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:22.040
So permeate, permeating

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:25.600
and the another one is the glistening

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:28.360
of the water is so your glistening

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:33.880
your skin becomes very radiant.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:39.600
And the last of all is the reflection.

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:42.760
A person, who sees you,

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:45.240
sees his own reflection.

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:48.040
He gets frightened.

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:50.400
This happens sometimes.

00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:53.000
I don't mean anything bad to anyone

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:55.960
but people are unnecessarily frightened of Me

00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:59.040
because they see their reflection.

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:01.120
So when they reach you they see their reflection

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:04.640
They can be very aggressive because they see their reflection.

00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:06.880
They can be very hard on you

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.960
because they see their reflection

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:18.200
and if it is clear-cut water,

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:22.040
then you see the depth of that person.

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:25.040
If you are clear-cut sahaja yogi

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:29.800
you feel the depth clearly

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:34.040
and they can see through - the spirit shines.

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:39.080
These are the qualities of water.

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:42.200
If it is enough,

00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:47.880
more of that I would say specially in My body

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.480
the water I have as buffer

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:52.440
because it protect the charkas.

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:56.640
If I don't have water in the body I may have problems.

00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:59.600
So it acts as buffer

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:04.560
also it soothes your epithelial cells;

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:07.400
you can say it soothes your blindness.

00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:09.320
You see, if you don't have moisture

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:13.080
its all being blindness/dryness in all.

00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:17.960
It soothes everyone

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:22.960
and there are other types of powers of water,

00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:24.480
which we know about

00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:28.400
when it comes out of your eyes

00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:33.080
it expresses your compassion,

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:36.080
your love, your emotions.

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:39.280
That is the only thing

00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:41.440
out of all the elements

00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:45.600
which expresses emotions,

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:50.000
Water power.

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:53.960
Water has other qualities also

00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:56.720
which many people know hydrostatics water,

00:15:56.840 --> 00:16:00.760
the pressure. It has a pressure

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:04.960
and a person who exists like a Sahaja yogi

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:07.440
will definitely put a pressure on others.

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:10.520
He will not, he will not aggress

00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:13.000
but there will be a pressure and pressure.

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:15.440
And another person if he receives one

00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:19.320
then he will gets the advantage of you,

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:21.160
but if he doesn't want to receive it

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:26.520
then he feel pressurized and feels little bit dominated.

00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:30.840
Your neighbors, your family people at the beginning

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:32.720
they feel a pressure because

00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:37.400
the body achieves a kind of a weight

00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:42.960
and that's how the Guru Tattwa is formed out of you.

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:47.760
And if there is fault in Guru Principle

00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:51.800
then the weight is even more.

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:56.520
So today for water should really

00:16:56.680 --> 00:17:01.200
know that the water is a very holy thing

00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:04.360
and in our pujas also we use

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:09.200
especially this signifies the Kundalini

00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:14.240
that means the Kundalini is the water jar

00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:17.280
the carrier of Aquarius.

00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:20.040
And this is the age of the Aquarius.

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:23.360
So how important is this water

00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:29.840
and the water is the carrier of divine love,

00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:32.440
is the best carrier.

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:36.240
And this is the time of Aquarius means the Kundalini

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:41.240
is made of divine water.

00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:51.800
So the whole idea of celebrating today the Lakshmi's day

00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:54.920
is to understand that in us

00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:57.280
She has become the Mahalakshmi.

00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:59.960
By that we have so many powers

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:02.000
of which we are not aware, I mean we do not know that

00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:05.120
we are realized souls. Some of us, we do not know

00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:06.852
and that we have those powers within us

00:18:07.053 --> 00:18:08.600
that we can permeate into others.

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:11.400
We can project our personalities to others.

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:14.840
We can find out what's wrong with them.

00:18:14.959 --> 00:18:16.682
We can find out about ourselves. We

00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:18.679
can go into ourselves, we can go into

00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:21.520
our permeation is like water is moving,

00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:24.115
is flowing all the time.

00:18:24.250 --> 00:18:27.752
And this is a very important thing

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:30.880
that we should be aware of our powers that we have achieved.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.120
Then we will start respecting ourselves

00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:35.040
then the Rajalakshmi comes in and

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:37.320
then the Gruhalakshmi comes in

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:40.600
and everything comes with in when we become aware

00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:45.640
of what we have achieved of our self-esteem.
