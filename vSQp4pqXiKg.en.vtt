00:00:00.794 --> 00:00:02.759
Can we start with Your childhood?

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:05.142
-Yes.
- Do You, can describe a little bit

00:00:05.343 --> 00:00:08.659
the circumstances where you were grown up?

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.123
- My family?
- Yes.

00:00:16.461 --> 00:00:22.931
I belong to a family of very enlightened people.

00:00:23.132 --> 00:00:27.760
My father was a linguist

00:00:27.951 --> 00:00:30.854
and he was master of fourteen languages.

00:00:31.055 --> 00:00:34.167
He knew about twenty-six languages

00:00:34.368 --> 00:00:41.467
and he translated even Koran-e-Sharif into Hindi language.

00:00:41.668 --> 00:00:46.920
My Mother was in those days

00:00:47.121 --> 00:00:51.041
was a honors in mathematics.

00:00:51.242 --> 00:00:57.500
So both were very well educated and enlightened people.

00:01:01.121 --> 00:01:05.399
At the time of My birth,

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.581
My mother dreamt

00:01:09.823 --> 00:01:12.168
something which she could not explain,

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:16.553
but after that she had a great desire to go and see a tiger

00:01:16.754 --> 00:01:19.299
in the open field.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.913
My father was a great hunter,

00:01:22.104 --> 00:01:25.819
because tigers were a menace in the area where we were living.

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.292
It was a hill station called Chhindwara.

00:01:30.493 --> 00:01:34.460
So there was a king who was very much interested in My father.

00:01:34.661 --> 00:01:36.801
Somehow or the other a letter came that

00:01:37.002 --> 00:01:40.949
there’s a tiger, a very big tiger that has appeared

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.413
and they are frightened of him that he might be a man-eater.

00:01:45.614 --> 00:01:51.412
So My father took My Mother and Me to that place.

00:01:52.099 --> 00:01:55.055
And they were sitting what we call as a machhan,

00:01:55.256 --> 00:02:00.972
where they built something, for people to sit on top of a tree,

00:02:01.173 --> 00:02:04.997
from where they can shoot nicely.

00:02:06.534 --> 00:02:09.895
And then My mother tells Me that a big huge tiger

00:02:10.096 --> 00:02:15.792
of a very big size, very beautifully appeared on the field.

00:02:15.993 --> 00:02:19.683
And she felt tremendous love for the tiger.

00:02:19.884 --> 00:02:25.522
It was a full moon day and she felt

00:02:26.492 --> 00:02:29.902
extremely compassionate towards the tiger.

00:02:30.103 --> 00:02:33.089
And when My father raised his gun to shoot,

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.826
she stopped him and she wouldn’t allow him.

00:02:36.027 --> 00:02:41.019
And the tiger went away and he never came to that forest again.

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.401
But that made My father think -

00:02:44.602 --> 00:02:47.523
because he himself was a realized soul -

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.836
that must be somebody,

00:02:52.037 --> 00:02:57.516
what we call a Goddess Durga who is fond of  a tiger

00:02:57.717 --> 00:03:01.041
must be born to My mother,

00:03:01.146 --> 00:03:03.818
because the symptoms were rather funny

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:06.768
that a lady should like to see a tiger and all.

00:03:06.969 --> 00:03:09.265
So he told My mother, “Now are you satisfied?”

00:03:09.466 --> 00:03:11.205
because they were struggling with the gun.

00:03:11.332 --> 00:03:14.156
He said, “Is there a Durga sitting in your womb

00:03:14.357 --> 00:03:17.785
that you are trying to protect the tiger?”

00:03:17.986 --> 00:03:21.625
She said, “Yes, yes, so stop it now. I won’t allow you.”

00:03:22.185 --> 00:03:24.505
Like that there were many incidents in My life

00:03:24.706 --> 00:03:29.617
because I am of a Christian family – protestants –

00:03:29.818 --> 00:03:33.278
and when I was born My mother didn’t feel any labor pains or anything

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:35.951
and just I was born; she didn’t know how.

00:03:36.223 --> 00:03:40.518
And I had no blood on My body, nothing, I was clean washed.

00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:44.031
That’s why they called My name as Nirmala.

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:49.856
But My grandmother said that She should be called as Nishkalanka,

00:03:50.075 --> 00:03:52.358
that means the one which has no spots on it.

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:54.535
But that’s the name of man.

00:03:54.736 --> 00:03:56.675
So they said, “All right, we'll call Her Nirmala

00:03:56.876 --> 00:03:59.436
meaning the same, Immaculata.”

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:04.712
Now all these incidents, and then My Father being a realized soul,

00:04:04.913 --> 00:04:08.130
he felt tremendous vibrations from Me,

00:04:08.373 --> 00:04:11.801
and he felt that this life is great

00:04:11.986 --> 00:04:17.330
and She will do something great in this life.

00:04:17.957 --> 00:04:19.528
I do not know why, but

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:23.018
I don’t know if he dreamt or he understood it, but

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:26.113
all the time if I remember when he talked to Me,

00:04:26.314 --> 00:04:29.433
he used to say that, "You have to find out a way

00:04:29.634 --> 00:04:33.710
of giving en masse Realization, all the time".

00:04:33.911 --> 00:04:37.439
As I told you, he was a great scholar of so many things,

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.599
and a very widely read man.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.606
So he gave Me a good education in religion,

00:04:45.807 --> 00:04:47.611
in different religions,

00:04:47.812 --> 00:04:51.028
and also good education about human beings,

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:52.950
what are their problems,

00:04:53.151 --> 00:04:56.295
why they react like this, why don’t they take to God,

00:04:56.496 --> 00:04:58.324
why are they hypocritical.

00:04:58.607 --> 00:05:01.387
All kinds of things he talked to Me.

00:05:01.615 --> 00:05:04.724
He also knew about Kundalini, but not so much.

00:05:05.248 --> 00:05:08.127
Of course, when I was born

00:05:08.328 --> 00:05:11.411
I knew about Kundalini myself.

00:05:11.612 --> 00:05:13.903
I knew all about it from My very childhood.

00:05:14.104 --> 00:05:17.165
I was a very aware person, extremely aware.

00:05:17.366 --> 00:05:18.789
But I didn’t know whom to talk to

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:21.331
because, see, people didn’t have that awareness.

00:05:21.532 --> 00:05:24.004
You can’t talk to everyone like that.

00:05:24.205 --> 00:05:26.523
So I was regarded as a very jolly person,

00:05:26.724 --> 00:05:31.211
at the same time very serious also, very deep,

00:05:31.412 --> 00:05:35.148
and then I started my studies as a child.

00:05:37.134 --> 00:05:38.568
I was not very much interested

00:05:38.769 --> 00:05:41.565
in the studies but I used to do very well,

00:05:41.766 --> 00:05:45.928
but I used to read lives of great men and things like that.

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:49.595
At a very young age I read Bernard Shaw.

00:05:49.796 --> 00:05:52.276
When people were reading just Great Expectations,

00:05:52.477 --> 00:05:54.674
I was reading Bernard Shaw.

00:05:54.875 --> 00:05:58.378
But as such I didn’t have interest in particularly reading

00:05:58.592 --> 00:06:01.359
some text books because I thought they were childish,

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:04.566
and there is nothing to be read about it.

00:06:04.767 --> 00:06:07.127
Then I told My father that “I have to do medicine.”

00:06:07.328 --> 00:06:10.545
So he said, “Why?” I said, “Because I have to talk to doctors.”

00:06:10.746 --> 00:06:13.714
He said, “You have to talk to doctors?” “Yes”, I said.

00:06:13.915 --> 00:06:16.121
But it so happened in My childhood

00:06:16.322 --> 00:06:19.049
when I was about seven years of age,

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:21.153
My father was a congressman,

00:06:21.354 --> 00:06:24.375
he had joined Congress when I was four years of age.

00:06:24.576 --> 00:06:26.944
He used to live with a style, very westernized.

00:06:27.145 --> 00:06:29.786
His clothes were stitched in London, sort of a man.

00:06:30.313 --> 00:06:32.029
We had governesses and all that.

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:35.918
He threw away everything and he became a real Indian

00:06:36.119 --> 00:06:40.089
and started leading a life of a martyr.

00:06:41.669 --> 00:06:46.500
Then he made us study our languages, Sanskrit...

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:50.675
He made Me study in an Indian school, not in a missionary school,

00:06:50.876 --> 00:06:53.043
because missionaries were very unkind.

00:06:53.244 --> 00:06:56.130
They threw us out of the school when My father was in the Congress.

00:06:56.331 --> 00:06:58.844
They were against us completely.

00:06:59.664 --> 00:07:04.537
Then at the age of seven years I happened to go with My Father

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:08.097
to Mahatma Gandhi.

00:07:08.298 --> 00:07:10.717
He was about seventy miles, living with us,

00:07:10.918 --> 00:07:13.013
but the first time he took Me down.

00:07:13.214 --> 00:07:14.804
And Mahatma Gandhi liked Me very much.

00:07:15.005 --> 00:07:17.170
He said, “Leave this child with me.”

00:07:17.371 --> 00:07:20.153
So, I had not even taken clothes or anything. I stayed on;

00:07:20.416 --> 00:07:25.422
then My Father sent Me everything with him.

00:07:25.646 --> 00:07:28.846
And he was very fond of Me, but I was a little girl,

00:07:29.047 --> 00:07:31.587
but he understood that there was something about Me.

00:07:31.788 --> 00:07:36.688
He consulted Me on very serious problems sometimes, surprisingly.

00:07:36.889 --> 00:07:39.297
Like one day he wanted to

00:07:39.498 --> 00:07:42.331
make the Prayer Book all right.

00:07:42.696 --> 00:07:45.908
So, he asked Me, “How should I put the series?” and all that.

00:07:46.109 --> 00:07:48.506
So I told him how to put the series

00:07:48.707 --> 00:07:51.449
and he put the series in that way.

00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:56.168
I used to go back for My school and again go back to Gandhiji,

00:07:56.369 --> 00:08:00.273
every year, like that. And he called Me Nepali.

00:08:00.474 --> 00:08:02.149
He'd given Me a name Nepali.

00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:05.195
Everybody used to call Me Nepali that time.

00:08:05.832 --> 00:08:10.009
Then I grew up with him very intimately.

00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:12.645
He was a very, very kind person for children,

00:08:12.846 --> 00:08:14.916
otherwise an extremely strict man,

00:08:15.117 --> 00:08:19.349
with himself and with others, very strict, a big disciplinarian.

00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:23.094
And he would make everybody get up at four o’clock,

00:08:23.295 --> 00:08:26.920
have your baths, everything, be ready for your morning prayers

00:08:27.121 --> 00:08:29.407
at five o’clock, you see, and he used to walk very fast.

00:08:29.608 --> 00:08:31.361
I also learnt walking fast with him.

00:08:31.562 --> 00:08:34.224
In his company I had to walk fast.

00:08:34.473 --> 00:08:38.116
And he was extremely loving and a very nice person,

00:08:38.317 --> 00:08:41.044
and he would listen to Me because I was a child, you see.

00:08:41.245 --> 00:08:43.285
Supposing I forced him to eat more or something,

00:08:43.486 --> 00:08:46.199
then he would, in laugh he would accept.

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:48.332
Very kindly person.

00:08:48.533 --> 00:08:51.099
But with others was very strict, and I used to tell him that,

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:53.847
“Why are you strict with everyone?”

00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:57.043
He said, “But You are a little girl, You get up in the morning time.

00:08:57.244 --> 00:08:59.893
Why can’t they get up?” I said, “I am little. That’s why I get up.

00:09:00.094 --> 00:09:04.499
They are big so they can’t get up”; like that, you see, little chats.

00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:06.960
And then My father went to jail

00:09:07.161 --> 00:09:08.887
and My mother also went to jail five times.

00:09:09.088 --> 00:09:11.299
My father went to jail twice,

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:13.308
once for about two and a half years,

00:09:13.509 --> 00:09:16.498
and he was the only supporting member of the family.

00:09:16.769 --> 00:09:20.573
By the way, we come from a very old royal family,

00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:26.065
which is called as Shalivahanas. They have a Calendar also in India.

00:09:26.266 --> 00:09:32.699
And then when we, I mean when they took My father to jail,

00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:35.437
we had to leave our house and we had to live in huts

00:09:35.638 --> 00:09:38.390
and in all problems, that was nothing.

00:09:38.591 --> 00:09:39.751
But also Me

00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:42.695
they pestered a lot, because I helped many people there

00:09:42.896 --> 00:09:45.854
and I joined the ’42 movement in a very serious way

00:09:46.055 --> 00:09:48.242
and I became the leader here for the young people.

00:09:48.443 --> 00:09:52.040
I thought unless and until I take a very positive stand,

00:09:52.241 --> 00:09:54.873
it may not work out with them.

00:09:56.600 --> 00:10:00.605
It’s not gracious to say how they tortured Me, what they did to Me,

00:10:00.806 --> 00:10:02.063
but they really tortured Me.

00:10:02.264 --> 00:10:05.443
I was a young girl of nineteen years that time.

00:10:06.001 --> 00:10:10.274
It is over now. So, it’s finished, and after that we,

00:10:10.475 --> 00:10:12.965
My father went to jail again

00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:15.057
and then when he came back

00:10:15.258 --> 00:10:20.081
he got elected as the member of the Central Assembly later on,

00:10:20.282 --> 00:10:24.030
as the Constituent Assembly and then at the Parliament.

00:10:24.231 --> 00:10:27.887
My brother was also a member of the Parliament, later on.

00:10:28.088 --> 00:10:33.022
Now, recently, he was the Minister in the Cabinet.

00:10:33.223 --> 00:10:37.839
Another brother is a High Court judge in Bombay.

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:40.080
They are all doing well, despite the fact

00:10:40.281 --> 00:10:43.337
that our parents neglected us in a way

00:10:43.538 --> 00:10:45.534
because they gave their lives for the country

00:10:45.735 --> 00:10:48.670
but, you see, that never deterred us from studies

00:10:48.871 --> 00:10:51.050
and we came up very well.

00:10:51.313 --> 00:10:53.772
Then I, when I was in the ’42 movement, you see,

00:10:53.973 --> 00:10:55.867
My college rusticated Me

00:10:56.129 --> 00:10:58.351
– from the college they threw Me out

00:10:58.552 --> 00:11:01.516
and I had to go to another college to study

00:11:01.667 --> 00:11:05.534
far away from My house, in Punjab,

00:11:05.735 --> 00:11:08.686
where I studied for two years.

00:11:08.798 --> 00:11:12.797
Science I did, then I did my medical.

00:11:13.158 --> 00:11:18.530
I didn’t do fully because, just after that the ’47 riots broke out,

00:11:18.731 --> 00:11:20.982
so our college was closed and I didn’t want to know more

00:11:21.183 --> 00:11:23.876
because what I wanted to know I came to know about it.

00:11:24.139 --> 00:11:27.505
So I did not need and I got married.

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:30.651
You must have heard My husband was, is now

00:11:30.852 --> 00:11:34.449
the Secretary-General of the International Maritime Organization.

00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:36.475
He held very high positions.

00:11:36.676 --> 00:11:40.525
He was also Secretary to Lal Bahadur Shastri,

00:11:40.726 --> 00:11:43.747
who was our Prime Minister, who was a another very great man,

00:11:43.987 --> 00:11:47.045
but he did not survive long. If he had survived

00:11:47.246 --> 00:11:49.705
things would have been different, I think, for our country

00:11:49.906 --> 00:11:52.847
because he was a Gandhian, out and out Gandhian,

00:11:53.048 --> 00:11:57.182
and he lived like an ideal Gandhian personality.

00:11:58.446 --> 00:12:02.047
So that’s how the life went on.

00:12:02.248 --> 00:12:07.694
But inner being was still seeking the way and methods

00:12:07.895 --> 00:12:10.357
of giving en masse Realization.

00:12:11.177 --> 00:12:16.389
My father said, “Before You do not develop this technique

00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:19.482
of giving en masse Realization, don’t talk of religion.

00:12:19.683 --> 00:12:22.180
Let nobody know that You know anything about it

00:12:22.381 --> 00:12:25.147
because they’ll crucify You,” or

00:12:25.348 --> 00:12:27.790
he was rather worried that people won’t understand

00:12:27.991 --> 00:12:30.071
or, ‘You may write another Bible or Geeta. No use.

00:12:30.272 --> 00:12:33.693
First of all you must give them Realization.

00:12:33.894 --> 00:12:35.556
If they get their Realization

00:12:35.757 --> 00:12:37.994
then they will realize that there is something about,

00:12:38.195 --> 00:12:41.158
above this human awareness”.

00:12:41.359 --> 00:12:43.996
For example, he always used to give an analogy -

00:12:44.197 --> 00:12:46.899
supposing you are born on the tenth storey

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:48.685
and everybody is on the ground,

00:12:48.886 --> 00:12:51.364
you must at least make them climb two storeys,

00:12:51.565 --> 00:12:53.483
so they know there is something above it;

00:12:53.684 --> 00:12:55.650
otherwise no use talking about it.

00:12:55.946 --> 00:12:58.551
And he said this is the mistake

00:12:58.752 --> 00:13:01.529
between the saints and the incarnations was

00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:05.044
that they never realized that these people are still on the ground,

00:13:05.245 --> 00:13:09.191
they have to still enter into the building.

00:13:09.392 --> 00:13:11.523
So that is what you have to be very careful

00:13:11.724 --> 00:13:14.911
that first of all you must give Realization to people.

00:13:15.693 --> 00:13:18.790
So I was seeking the ways and methods,

00:13:18.991 --> 00:13:21.013
working it out inside Myself

00:13:21.214 --> 00:13:24.917
through My own style of meditation in the sense that

00:13:25.118 --> 00:13:27.533
I would work out all the permutations and combinations.

00:13:27.734 --> 00:13:30.761
Supposing I met one person, then I would see

00:13:30.962 --> 00:13:34.914
what problems that person had, how you can overcome it like that.

00:13:35.115 --> 00:13:38.629
I would try to study that person internally.

00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:42.321
And I went to many people to find out,

00:13:42.522 --> 00:13:44.889
but I found they were great hypocrites.

00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:46.696
I saw so many of these gurus.

00:13:46.897 --> 00:13:50.799
Most of them I saw them, I was surprised, they were all hypocrites,

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.136
money-making and this thing.

00:13:53.337 --> 00:13:57.097
And also I went to Rajneesh also, to see him.

00:13:57.298 --> 00:14:01.034
Then he said that I should come to his program.

00:14:01.256 --> 00:14:02.557
I did not know what sort of man

00:14:02.758 --> 00:14:04.977
because he was talking about Geeta and big, big things.

00:14:05.178 --> 00:14:07.573
I thought he might be knowing something about it.

00:14:07.774 --> 00:14:09.338
I went there, but my husband said,

00:14:09.539 --> 00:14:11.203
“No, I won't allow You to go to his camp”

00:14:11.404 --> 00:14:13.847
So he arranged his own bungalow and all that for Me.

00:14:14.048 --> 00:14:15.484
So I went down there

00:14:15.685 --> 00:14:18.357
and there I couldn't see all the things that were going on

00:14:18.558 --> 00:14:20.636
and that is the day somehow or other

00:14:20.874 --> 00:14:24.950
I said I must open the last chakra. So the last chakra was opened.

00:14:25.151 --> 00:14:30.630
And I saw the Kundalini which is the Primordial force within us,

00:14:30.831 --> 00:14:34.536
which is the Holy Ghost within us,

00:14:34.704 --> 00:14:37.576
rising like a telescope, opening out,

00:14:38.236 --> 00:14:42.266
and then I saw the whole thing open

00:14:42.467 --> 00:14:46.486
and a big torrential rain of breeze

00:14:46.701 --> 00:14:49.755
started flowing through My head all over,

00:14:49.956 --> 00:14:52.794
as if, and I felt "I am lost now. I am no more there.

00:14:52.995 --> 00:14:55.826
It’s only the Grace is there, that is there."

00:14:56.027 --> 00:14:59.040
I saw it completely happening to Me.

00:14:59.241 --> 00:15:05.195
And, but I was amazed that when I went to Rajneesh, you see,

00:15:05.396 --> 00:15:07.129
because before going I had to say goodbye.

00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:09.621
He never realized what had happened or anything.

00:15:09.822 --> 00:15:10.920
So I was surprised.

00:15:11.121 --> 00:15:14.362
I said, “This man doesn’t know anything about God”,

00:15:14.563 --> 00:15:16.763
and then I discovered that they were all hypocrites

00:15:16.964 --> 00:15:18.569
and telling lies.

00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:24.484
So in 1973 this happened, on 5th of May

00:15:24.685 --> 00:15:27.368
’70, 1970, 5-th of May.

00:15:27.569 --> 00:15:29.448
And just after that

00:15:29.649 --> 00:15:33.508
we had a very big lecture in Jahangir Hall - there's a very big hall -

00:15:33.709 --> 00:15:36.663
and thousands of people had come. I told them very frankly

00:15:36.864 --> 00:15:39.491
that these are all thugs and these are like this, hypocrites.

00:15:39.692 --> 00:15:41.977
Some of them are demoniacs. Some are evil people.

00:15:42.178 --> 00:15:45.686
I took their names, everything. I told them, “Don’t go near them.”

00:15:45.887 --> 00:15:48.411
There were some foreigners also.

00:15:50.923 --> 00:15:54.463
And there were so many others whom I told these things very clearly,

00:15:54.664 --> 00:15:57.260
and they got frightened. They said, “You shouldn’t say like this.

00:15:57.461 --> 00:15:58.959
They’ll come and murder you. They’ll do..."

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:00.682
”I said, “Let them come and murder Me.”

00:16:00.883 --> 00:16:04.639
But nobody did anything. Nobody even went to the courts.

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:09.927
And that’s how, you see, they tried to bring bad name to Me.

00:16:10.128 --> 00:16:13.609
They paid money to the newspapers to publish things against Me,

00:16:13.810 --> 00:16:16.126
because I said, “You cannot pay money.”

00:16:16.327 --> 00:16:21.029
So they thought that I was just trying to, you see, harm them

00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:24.636
by saying such a thing that you can’t earn money in the name of God.

00:16:24.837 --> 00:16:29.062
If it’s a job you can do it, but God’s work is not a job.

00:16:29.263 --> 00:16:33.660
And the struggle started

00:16:33.897 --> 00:16:36.953
from the day I started giving Realization,

00:16:37.154 --> 00:16:41.317
and I started with one lady who got Realization first.

00:16:41.533 --> 00:16:45.374
Then we got about twelve people who got Realization.

00:16:45.575 --> 00:16:51.499
In two years I got only about fourteen people Realization.

00:16:51.828 --> 00:16:54.659
Then gradually when fourteen people got Realization then

00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:57.585
many others started getting Realization.

00:16:57.786 --> 00:17:02.916
But I started also curing people because that was helping a lot.

00:17:03.117 --> 00:17:07.613
Then My husband got elected to this post

00:17:07.814 --> 00:17:09.896
and we had to come to London.

00:17:10.097 --> 00:17:11.473
So when I came to London

00:17:11.674 --> 00:17:15.321
we had one program in Bhartiya Vidya Bhavan. They arranged it.

00:17:15.572 --> 00:17:18.693
So the Indians abroad are not so much interested in God;

00:17:18.894 --> 00:17:20.791
they are more interested in money.

00:17:20.992 --> 00:17:24.400
So none of the Indians stayed there. They all ran away.

00:17:24.649 --> 00:17:30.299
And only the foreigners who were there, were about seven hippies.

00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:32.429
So I had to work on them, seven hippies.

00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:36.433
For four years I was working on them, to give them Realization.

00:17:36.634 --> 00:17:39.145
Very difficult, you see. Their liver was bad.

00:17:39.346 --> 00:17:42.937
They had ill health. Their head was off, terrible times.

00:17:43.138 --> 00:17:45.229
But in between I used to go to India,

00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:47.261
and in India also the work was done.

00:17:47.462 --> 00:17:49.560
For three months always I would be in India.

00:17:49.761 --> 00:17:51.920
So we started working in the villages,

00:17:52.121 --> 00:17:55.160
specially surprisingly where My forefathers were ruling,

00:17:55.361 --> 00:17:58.669
in that area, the work started moving in a very big way.

00:17:58.870 --> 00:18:02.602
And there then we started taking some people from India.

00:18:02.803 --> 00:18:07.589
Then some people came from Australia to India, like that,

00:18:07.835 --> 00:18:11.974
and the work started moving in those directions.

00:18:12.175 --> 00:18:15.394
Then gradually the work improved and people found

00:18:15.595 --> 00:18:18.641
that this is the way we can transform ourselves.

00:18:18.842 --> 00:18:21.963
Many people who were taking drugs or alcoholic

00:18:22.164 --> 00:18:24.764
or mad people, or cancer people ,

00:18:24.965 --> 00:18:27.359
they felt better, then they got cured

00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:32.732
and it was established that Sahaja Yoga is something very important.

00:18:34.319 --> 00:18:37.313
Now when I travel all over the world,

00:18:37.514 --> 00:18:40.550
you see, first My husband used to pay for everything.

00:18:40.751 --> 00:18:43.156
Wherever I went, he had to pay all.

00:18:43.357 --> 00:18:45.537
Any expenses he used to do for Me.

00:18:45.738 --> 00:18:48.971
Gradually, then now, these people pay for My travel,

00:18:49.172 --> 00:18:53.104
but otherwise they don’t have to pay for anything else

00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:57.475
That’s how we started our work. There was lot of opposition

00:18:57.676 --> 00:19:02.077
and the media people would never understand it,

00:19:02.278 --> 00:19:06.293
because it was no such a sensation as you can say,

00:19:06.494 --> 00:19:08.222
nothing to people feel excited.

00:19:08.423 --> 00:19:09.942
But in a way it’s a very great thing,

00:19:10.143 --> 00:19:13.068
because if this is the solution for the whole world.

00:19:13.269 --> 00:19:15.031
One should try to do it.

00:19:15.232 --> 00:19:20.024
Then we had very great people who came to Sahaja Yoga,

00:19:20.225 --> 00:19:24.386
like, we can say,

00:19:24.587 --> 00:19:29.542
the Hague High Court judge, who is now the President,

00:19:29.817 --> 00:19:34.273
who has given Nicaragua, this thing judgment.

00:19:34.516 --> 00:19:38.602
He and many lawyers and many barristers.

00:19:38.803 --> 00:19:42.126
We have one barrister here from Algeria,

00:19:42.327 --> 00:19:44.680
and doctors, and then they took over

00:19:44.881 --> 00:19:49.393
and they started helping Me out how to propagate Sahaja Yoga.

00:19:51.001 --> 00:19:53.296
But it was a difficult task in the West.

00:19:53.497 --> 00:19:55.999
Of course, in India it spread very fast in the villages

00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:58.188
but city people in India also

00:19:58.419 --> 00:20:00.964
are westernized and they start analyzing.

00:20:01.165 --> 00:20:03.150
They don’t know much about our past.

00:20:03.351 --> 00:20:05.606
They don’t know anything about our heritage,

00:20:05.686 --> 00:20:08.207
that we have our Kundalini and all that.

00:20:08.408 --> 00:20:10.950
But some people do know about self-Realization.

00:20:11.151 --> 00:20:13.161
But these gurus could not stick on in India

00:20:13.362 --> 00:20:16.817
because nobody would accept them. So they all run away abroad.

00:20:17.057 --> 00:20:19.145
And that was something a blessing for Me also

00:20:19.346 --> 00:20:21.978
because I didn’t have to fight them there,

00:20:22.179 --> 00:20:24.691
and it started working out,

00:20:24.892 --> 00:20:27.474
and then people found that it helps in every way,

00:20:27.731 --> 00:20:30.392
and they found so many miracles about it,

00:20:30.593 --> 00:20:34.264
and that’s how Sahaja Yoga got settled quite a lot.

00:20:34.465 --> 00:20:36.486
But still I would say that

00:20:36.687 --> 00:20:39.202
we have not been to certain countries so far,

00:20:39.403 --> 00:20:44.148
and in the west, I would say that so much work has still to be done.

00:20:44.349 --> 00:20:47.462
Because as soon as you start any work in any place,

00:20:47.663 --> 00:20:50.819
first of all they want Me to cure people

00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:53.321
and to help them with curatives.

00:20:53.522 --> 00:20:56.101
Now if I pay attention more to that,

00:20:56.302 --> 00:21:00.119
then the main work is to create doctors out of everyone.

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:02.826
That is neglected. Then you become unpopular.

00:21:03.027 --> 00:21:05.873
They think, “Oh, She is not sympathetic” and this and that.

00:21:06.074 --> 00:21:08.058
But now as we have, everybody can cure now,

00:21:08.259 --> 00:21:10.564
everyone. I don’t cure anyone directly.

00:21:10.765 --> 00:21:13.170
But they don’t like it. They want I should be there

00:21:13.371 --> 00:21:15.834
and their ego to be pampered and all those things are there.

00:21:16.035 --> 00:21:17.360
Rather difficult.

00:21:17.561 --> 00:21:20.124
It’s not, we are not running an election, you see,

00:21:20.325 --> 00:21:22.843
like we should please others sort of thing, is not there.

00:21:23.044 --> 00:21:25.142
But whatever is reality,

00:21:25.343 --> 00:21:30.059
if a person has intelligence – pure intelligence

00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:33.178
– he can see that this is something very different

00:21:33.379 --> 00:21:35.937
and for that one has to

00:21:36.138 --> 00:21:40.079
understand that you cannot,

00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:45.235
you cannot force on anyone that "You get your Realization".

00:21:45.436 --> 00:21:49.513
In the same way you cannot force Me that I give you Realization,

00:21:49.714 --> 00:21:51.603
because if it does not work, it does not work.

00:21:51.804 --> 00:21:53.321
It’s such a living force, you see.

00:21:53.522 --> 00:21:56.403
And that upsets them very soon.

00:21:56.604 --> 00:22:00.177
I feel that the way

00:22:00.378 --> 00:22:04.718
this industrial revolution has come in the west,

00:22:04.919 --> 00:22:08.417
people have lost their moorings, perhaps. They are so confused.

00:22:08.618 --> 00:22:11.517
With all these gurus coming down here confusing them

00:22:11.718 --> 00:22:16.211
and all kinds of new things coming, they don’t know where to look.

00:22:16.412 --> 00:22:20.344
But unless and until you get your evolution completed,

00:22:20.545 --> 00:22:24.121
unless and until you reach that absolute state of understanding,

00:22:24.322 --> 00:22:25.812
the chaos will remain.

00:22:26.013 --> 00:22:28.740
So one has to try to get to that.

00:22:28.941 --> 00:22:33.890
But one must understand you can’t pay for it. There is no effort.

00:22:34.091 --> 00:22:35.249
After getting Realization

00:22:35.450 --> 00:22:37.796
they feel so satisfied, they forget about it.

00:22:37.997 --> 00:22:40.662
But after that you must know how to give it to others.

00:22:40.863 --> 00:22:44.313
As Christ has said that the light which is enlightened,

00:22:44.514 --> 00:22:46.411
you do not put it under the table.

00:22:46.612 --> 00:22:48.408
That’s how what happens that,

00:22:48.609 --> 00:22:51.772
it's a, though we may give Realization at hundred people,

00:22:51.973 --> 00:22:55.806
only out of that five to six will come forward to help us out.

00:22:56.007 --> 00:22:58.513
But still I must say lot of work has been done.

00:22:58.714 --> 00:23:01.378
Especially Austria, I am very proud of Austria.

00:23:01.579 --> 00:23:06.629
And the way they have never given Me any problem – never –

00:23:06.834 --> 00:23:09.608
and very good people have come out of Austria.

00:23:09.808 --> 00:23:16.003
Very balanced, you see, level-headed people, very level-headed.

00:23:16.204 --> 00:23:18.861
They are not extremists. They do not go to extremes.

00:23:19.062 --> 00:23:23.099
There is no fanaticism about them. They are sensible people,

00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:27.714
and something so lucky that Austria was found out

00:23:27.915 --> 00:23:31.154
because I never expected that in Austria

00:23:31.355 --> 00:23:33.654
there will be so many people. But somehow

00:23:33.855 --> 00:23:38.106
like water finds its own level, Sahaja Yoga finds its own level.

00:23:38.307 --> 00:23:40.191
We just came down to Austria.

00:23:40.392 --> 00:23:44.892
We haven’t been to Norway, to Sweden, Denmark, Finland.

00:23:45.093 --> 00:23:48.148
I visited those places because of My husband’s job

00:23:48.349 --> 00:23:50.521
but I have not been there.

00:23:50.722 --> 00:23:57.014
Now we have sixteen centers in Australia,

00:23:57.215 --> 00:24:00.255
and Australia is a very progressive Sahaja Yoga thing.

00:24:00.456 --> 00:24:03.327
We have got schools now there. They are running schools

00:24:03.528 --> 00:24:10.243
and the teachers are extremely well-behaved and visionaries,

00:24:10.444 --> 00:24:12.796
and they look after the children very well.

00:24:13.042 --> 00:24:17.744
The Government people sent somebody for observation

00:24:17.945 --> 00:24:20.900
and they have remarked that whatever they proclaim,

00:24:21.101 --> 00:24:22.649
that’s what they manifest,

00:24:22.850 --> 00:24:25.727
and they have given good certificates to us.

00:24:25.928 --> 00:24:29.534
But the greatest achievement on the outward life is this,

00:24:29.735 --> 00:24:33.027
that Cambridge University has accepted Sahaja Yoga

00:24:33.228 --> 00:24:36.991
for a research work, with respect, by one Dr. Lee,

00:24:37.192 --> 00:24:39.951
who is doing the research about Sahaja Yoga in Cambridge University.

00:24:40.152 --> 00:24:41.291
He is already a Doctor.

00:24:41.492 --> 00:24:45.442
And there is another great thing has happened in Delhi University,

00:24:45.643 --> 00:24:48.651
that the Delhi University has accepted

00:24:48.852 --> 00:24:54.653
that a person can do, only a doctor can do, a PhD,

00:24:54.854 --> 00:24:57.623
or we can say the Doctorate in Sahaja Yoga,

00:24:57.841 --> 00:25:03.912
and he gets the highest degree called the Doctor of Medicine,

00:25:04.113 --> 00:25:08.754
and perhaps maybe after sometime they will allow anyone to do that.

00:25:08.955 --> 00:25:10.746
This is about the medicine part of it.

00:25:10.947 --> 00:25:13.619
In agriculture we have done lots of research, Myself.

00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:16.894
We have somebody here, an expert on agriculture.

00:25:17.095 --> 00:25:19.259
He has also done lot of research,

00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:24.829
and we found out, that with vibrations we start after Realization,

00:25:25.030 --> 00:25:29.627
if you vibrate the water and if you water the plants with that,

00:25:29.828 --> 00:25:32.819
then sometimes you might get even ten times more breed.

00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:37.300
That’s what they did in India, in one of the Agricultural University.

00:25:37.501 --> 00:25:40.519
But here also he’s found out that there’s tremendous difference

00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:43.247
between the growth of an ordinary thing.

00:25:43.496 --> 00:25:46.037
Another thing we have found out in agriculture,

00:25:46.238 --> 00:25:48.159
that if you give vibrations then

00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:52.220
even an ordinary cow can give lot of milk.

00:25:52.852 --> 00:25:55.265
But if you have hybrid cows then, you see,

00:25:55.466 --> 00:25:56.820
it’s not good for the brain,

00:25:57.034 --> 00:26:00.923
because a person who takes hybrid milk, also gets hybrid.

00:26:01.124 --> 00:26:03.296
I mean his brain becomes little wobbly.

00:26:03.497 --> 00:26:06.470
So better to have a pure milk from a cow

00:26:06.671 --> 00:26:11.321
which is not been put to this kind of a experimentation.

00:26:11.522 --> 00:26:13.857
Moreover, food also, if it’s hybrid food,

00:26:14.058 --> 00:26:17.711
it’s not very good for us because that spoils our nerves, I think.

00:26:17.912 --> 00:26:21.907
But ordinary seeds you cannot use because they have weakened

00:26:22.108 --> 00:26:23.669
and they cannot reproduce.

00:26:23.870 --> 00:26:26.408
So when we vibrate them

00:26:26.609 --> 00:26:29.157
they produce very well just like,

00:26:29.358 --> 00:26:31.719
better than even sometimes, hybrid thing,

00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:33.973
and the food, it tastes very well

00:26:34.174 --> 00:26:36.122
and it doesn’t give those complications.

00:26:36.323 --> 00:26:38.600
So this can help in agriculture in India,

00:26:38.801 --> 00:26:41.780
and the government has allotted us lot of land

00:26:41.981 --> 00:26:44.147
where we are going to now experiment,

00:26:44.348 --> 00:26:46.702
and we are going to start the experimentation there

00:26:46.903 --> 00:26:49.260
to show that how we can use this.

00:26:49.461 --> 00:26:52.950
But many farmers who are Sahaja Yogis have done a lot of job

00:26:53.151 --> 00:26:57.211
and they have discovered that even animals

00:26:57.412 --> 00:26:59.870
and this, what you call,

00:27:00.071 --> 00:27:04.412
farming, everything is helped very much by vibration.

00:27:04.613 --> 00:27:07.030
So it improves the lives of people.

00:27:07.231 --> 00:27:10.824
We have on the other side, social side, I can tell you that

00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:15.009
we have our marriages – international marriages.

00:27:15.210 --> 00:27:19.426
We arrange international marriages between people.

00:27:19.627 --> 00:27:25.345
They have to know each other and they are together.

00:27:25.546 --> 00:27:29.796
And first of all they are together for one or half month

00:27:29.997 --> 00:27:31.661
with us in the tour. They see each other

00:27:31.862 --> 00:27:33.277
and their marriages are fixed.

00:27:33.478 --> 00:27:37.363
And we have seen that such marriages are extremely successful.

00:27:37.564 --> 00:27:40.053
Ninety-nine percent marriages are successful.

00:27:40.254 --> 00:27:41.951
Once in a while, maybe a mishap,

00:27:42.152 --> 00:27:44.758
but mostly there are no divorces that take place.

00:27:44.959 --> 00:27:46.824
Once in a while if it’s not successful

00:27:47.025 --> 00:27:48.682
we have no objection to divorce also,

00:27:48.935 --> 00:27:51.261
but mostly it is successful and they get children

00:27:51.462 --> 00:27:53.462
who are very intelligent,

00:27:53.653 --> 00:27:56.328
who are themselves born realized children, mostly.

00:27:56.529 --> 00:28:00.188
So the problem is much less and the family life improves.

00:28:00.389 --> 00:28:03.280
The quality of life is thousand times better.

00:28:03.481 --> 00:28:06.555
People are very joyous, happy, they do not complain,

00:28:06.756 --> 00:28:08.853
and they enjoy life and they give to others.

00:28:09.054 --> 00:28:12.287
They share what joy they have. So …

00:28:12.488 --> 00:28:13.516
I: Can I ask a question?

00:28:13.717 --> 00:28:15.452
What do you think are the important points

00:28:15.653 --> 00:28:17.286
in the education of children,

00:28:17.487 --> 00:28:21.155
what are important to give to the children?

00:28:21.356 --> 00:28:24.060
You see, first if they get Realization,

00:28:24.261 --> 00:28:26.962
to get first time to that point of Realization...

00:28:27.163 --> 00:28:29.193
If they are already born realized no problem,

00:28:29.394 --> 00:28:31.777
but if they have, they're given Realization,

00:28:31.978 --> 00:28:34.693
then, you see, they start seeing from a different level.

00:28:34.894 --> 00:28:38.673
They become the Spirit. So their self-respect, you see, awaken.

00:28:39.621 --> 00:28:44.638
Such children behave in a very dignified, elderly manner, you see.

00:28:44.839 --> 00:28:47.262
They talk in a very elderly manner

00:28:47.463 --> 00:28:50.046
and this gives solutions of all kinds, you see.

00:28:50.247 --> 00:28:53.101
And they are tremendous people.

00:28:53.302 --> 00:28:56.978
But we have to guide them properly by our own behavior,

00:28:57.179 --> 00:29:00.317
how we behave. The greatest thing is how we behave.

00:29:00.518 --> 00:29:02.225
That’s how the children learn.

00:29:02.426 --> 00:29:06.340
We put the children certain

00:29:06.541 --> 00:29:08.890
to some tests, how they are.

00:29:09.091 --> 00:29:12.369
We find out if they have any physical problems, we cure them.

00:29:12.570 --> 00:29:14.761
If they have mental problem, we cure them.

00:29:14.962 --> 00:29:18.673
If they have any other problem, social problem or anything,

00:29:18.874 --> 00:29:20.190
we try to help them out.

00:29:20.391 --> 00:29:24.830
So that basically if a human being is all right in the childhood,

00:29:25.031 --> 00:29:27.441
then fundamentals are all right for the child.

00:29:27.642 --> 00:29:29.014
The foundation is laid down.

00:29:29.215 --> 00:29:33.404
Then to build a child up into a good quality is not difficult.

00:29:33.605 --> 00:29:37.176
So now we find great artists are there,

00:29:37.377 --> 00:29:39.398
there are great musicians

00:29:39.599 --> 00:29:42.634
and at a very young age they have started playing violin...

00:29:42.835 --> 00:29:46.295
I mean suddenly they have become dynamic also and very humble.

00:29:46.496 --> 00:29:49.804
They are very humble and self-respectfing and very well-behaved.

00:29:50.005 --> 00:29:54.241
It's surprising how the atmosphere is and how it works out.

00:29:54.442 --> 00:29:57.324
And the other day the lady asked Me about the women

00:29:57.525 --> 00:30:01.650
and I told her that a woman’s power as a mother is very great.

00:30:01.851 --> 00:30:03.718
And she felt hurt about it. But I didn’t mean

00:30:03.919 --> 00:30:05.848
that you should be just a mother. What I am saying,

00:30:06.049 --> 00:30:09.443
she is a mother, means she is compassionate, she is kind,

00:30:09.644 --> 00:30:11.389
she is not aggressive like men.

00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:13.161
That is a very big quality.

00:30:13.362 --> 00:30:16.282
That is a very big power in a woman. That is what I was suggesting

00:30:16.483 --> 00:30:18.110
that that is what we have to earn,

00:30:18.311 --> 00:30:22.291
is not to compete with men. It's madness to compete with men,

00:30:22.492 --> 00:30:25.711
and to go about like that, because...

00:30:25.981 --> 00:30:29.695
You see we have to understand that life

00:30:29.896 --> 00:30:34.897
has to be enjoyable.

00:30:35.495 --> 00:30:38.643
Life is to be a blessing, not to be a misery.

00:30:38.862 --> 00:30:42.120
We create our own miseries by these false ideas,

00:30:42.321 --> 00:30:47.588
by our own conflictions we have in our mind,

00:30:47.789 --> 00:30:49.902
mental projections we have in our mind,

00:30:50.093 --> 00:30:52.882
or our own obstinacy – whatever it is.

00:30:53.083 --> 00:30:55.362
All these things can be cured

00:30:55.575 --> 00:30:57.037
if you take to Sahaja Yoga

00:30:57.238 --> 00:31:00.588
because you become a balanced person, level-headed, wise person.

00:31:00.789 --> 00:31:01.834
And you become a witness.

00:31:02.035 --> 00:31:04.455
The whole thing becomes like a show, like a drama.

00:31:04.656 --> 00:31:05.696
And you become fearless,

00:31:05.897 --> 00:31:07.836
you start seeing the whole thing like a drama.

00:31:08.037 --> 00:31:10.328
And this is what a human being has to achieve.

00:31:10.529 --> 00:31:13.923
We talk of peace. We talk of no war.

00:31:14.124 --> 00:31:16.107
We talk of many things like this, you see,

00:31:16.308 --> 00:31:19.593
atomic bomb, this, that... All that is not going to work out.

00:31:19.807 --> 00:31:21.084
Only what is going to work out

00:31:21.285 --> 00:31:23.184
is the transformation of human beings.

00:31:23.385 --> 00:31:25.141
If the human beings are transformed,

00:31:25.342 --> 00:31:27.757
things will work out absolutely first class.

00:31:27.958 --> 00:31:33.739
Not only that, but that they will enjoy the bliss of life.

00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:36.589
We are missing the point altogether!

00:31:36.790 --> 00:31:39.570
This is a very important thing

00:31:39.771 --> 00:31:41.689
that human beings must say, one thing:

00:31:41.890 --> 00:31:44.419
what have we achieved out of all these?

00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:46.971
Just for a minute to stop and think.

00:31:49.237 --> 00:31:51.546
What would you say is the definition of illness?

00:31:51.682 --> 00:31:54.132
What's the causes of illness?

00:31:54.979 --> 00:31:58.866
It’s the physical, mental, emotional, all illnesses are caused

00:31:59.067 --> 00:32:02.874
by the imbalances within us, by our extreme behavior.

00:32:03.075 --> 00:32:06.873
And supposing say now the cancer. We can take the cancer.

00:32:07.074 --> 00:32:10.304
Cancer is caused by the over-activity

00:32:10.505 --> 00:32:12.827
of the sympathetic nervous system.

00:32:13.028 --> 00:32:18.595
Now supposing a person is a very sad person.

00:32:18.796 --> 00:32:22.216
He cries and weeps and all the time feels guilty

00:32:22.417 --> 00:32:25.032
and thinks that he is the worst person ever born,

00:32:25.233 --> 00:32:28.657
he’s committed so many sins and all sorts of nonsense, you see.

00:32:28.897 --> 00:32:31.341
Then he goes to the left side, according to us

00:32:31.542 --> 00:32:34.289
and crosses over to the collective subconscious area.

00:32:34.490 --> 00:32:38.082
And there, according to us, what they call as Protein 58,

00:32:38.283 --> 00:32:41.004
and Protein 52, doctors call it that way,

00:32:41.205 --> 00:32:43.277
but we call it as the dead souls;

00:32:43.478 --> 00:32:45.825
they exist there and they catch hold of you

00:32:46.026 --> 00:32:48.206
and they trigger the cancer.

00:32:48.407 --> 00:32:49.840
But supposing by any chance

00:32:50.041 --> 00:32:53.504
you can bring the attention fully away from that

00:32:53.705 --> 00:32:55.860
in the center you can get cured.

00:32:56.061 --> 00:32:59.791
So it is the centers within us which are subtle,

00:33:00.026 --> 00:33:02.317
which are basically seven centers.

00:33:02.518 --> 00:33:04.500
There are many others, but basically seven.

00:33:04.677 --> 00:33:06.053
If you can put them right,

00:33:06.254 --> 00:33:10.257
you cannot have any sickness or illness, of any kind.

00:33:11.758 --> 00:33:15.095
Let's go back to your childhood.

00:33:15.365 --> 00:33:20.015
Can You explain - Your parents

00:33:20.216 --> 00:33:23.649
supported You very much in Your learning and in Your studies.

00:33:23.850 --> 00:33:26.070
It’s correct? [unclear]

00:33:26.365 --> 00:33:29.567
Yes, yes. Of course. You see in...

00:33:29.768 --> 00:33:31.377
Is this normal

00:33:31.514 --> 00:33:34.339
that parents support the child like You in Your family?

00:33:34.540 --> 00:33:37.485
In India, all parents support the child.

00:33:37.686 --> 00:33:40.120
- Even if...
- You can learn everything what You want to?

00:33:40.337 --> 00:33:41.972
Yes, yes, I mean, that is true.

00:33:42.210 --> 00:33:44.013
But you see the basic thing is

00:33:44.214 --> 00:33:47.702
parents are very benevolent to children, very kind to children,

00:33:47.903 --> 00:33:52.851
and to them, you see, the child’s education, child’s upbringing

00:33:53.052 --> 00:33:55.965
and child’s life is very important.

00:33:56.166 --> 00:34:00.047
That’s why we know they are, so we depend on them,

00:34:00.248 --> 00:34:03.534
they look after us and they are very wise people.

00:34:03.735 --> 00:34:05.678
They sacrifice everything for us.

00:34:05.879 --> 00:34:09.096
So, whatever they say we think it’s nice

00:34:09.312 --> 00:34:12.317
and by doing this we have not lost anything so far.

00:34:12.533 --> 00:34:14.761
In India if you find Indian children when they come abroad

00:34:14.962 --> 00:34:16.862
they always talk the least anywhere.

00:34:17.063 --> 00:34:19.112
They are very obedient children

00:34:19.313 --> 00:34:21.612
and they behave very well.

00:34:21.813 --> 00:34:24.656
We don’t have all this problem, teenage problem, homosexual.

00:34:24.857 --> 00:34:26.731
We don’t know even all this problems are

00:34:26.932 --> 00:34:29.341
because we are so close with the parents all the time.

00:34:29.542 --> 00:34:31.874
They all the time watch us. We don’t have drug problem,

00:34:32.075 --> 00:34:34.855
none of these. Only in the cities, little bit,

00:34:35.056 --> 00:34:36.597
it happens and it disappears;

00:34:36.798 --> 00:34:39.007
because parents are all the time with their children.

00:34:39.208 --> 00:34:41.564
We live together. The whole family lives together.

00:34:41.765 --> 00:34:43.420
And not only with the parents

00:34:43.621 --> 00:34:46.405
but all the relations and all the people

00:34:46.606 --> 00:34:49.521
in the village and the city, everyone knows each other.

00:34:49.722 --> 00:34:52.225
Such a joint system we have

00:34:52.392 --> 00:34:56.526
that we do not normally,

00:34:56.727 --> 00:34:59.742
sort of, go into wrong ways and methods

00:34:59.943 --> 00:35:02.458
and we do not become obstinate also.

00:35:03.133 --> 00:35:05.549
- But, You grew up in a Christian family in India.
- Yes.

00:35:05.750 --> 00:35:06.822
Yes.

00:35:07.017 --> 00:35:11.320
It’s not a normal situation, that Indian people are Christian.

00:35:11.521 --> 00:35:13.125
Yes, I know. It is, you see,

00:35:13.326 --> 00:35:15.667
I was born in a Christian family deliberately,

00:35:15.850 --> 00:35:19.714
because I think, you see, I personally think,

00:35:19.915 --> 00:35:22.753
that Protestants are the greatest fanatics;

00:35:22.954 --> 00:35:24.936
because they are very sophisticated, you see,

00:35:25.137 --> 00:35:26.555
their fanaticism is in their brain.

00:35:26.756 --> 00:35:28.682
Nobody can make them out of their fanaticism.

00:35:28.883 --> 00:35:31.441
They are very great fanatics, the greatest of all.

00:35:31.642 --> 00:35:33.738
But My parents were very enlightened people

00:35:33.939 --> 00:35:35.971
and they understood Christ very well.

00:35:36.172 --> 00:35:38.777
Yesterday I told you about Paul, you see, when I was -

00:35:38.978 --> 00:35:40.917
first time I took the Bible in the hand

00:35:41.118 --> 00:35:42.853
and I asked My father, “Who is this Paul?”.

00:35:43.054 --> 00:35:46.270
He said “He is an intruder. Forget him. Don’t read him at all.”

00:35:46.471 --> 00:35:48.862
So you see they understood all these things very well

00:35:49.063 --> 00:35:51.165
and because My father was a realized soul,

00:35:51.366 --> 00:35:53.577
like Khalil Gibran, you see. If you read Khalil Gibran,

00:35:53.778 --> 00:35:55.860
he says the same thing about Paul, the same thing.

00:35:56.061 --> 00:35:59.156
So, you see, if you are an enlightened person,

00:35:59.357 --> 00:36:01.138
you see the essence of everything.

00:36:01.339 --> 00:36:03.088
Whatever religion you may be born,

00:36:03.263 --> 00:36:06.143
you don’t ignore any other religion.

00:36:06.344 --> 00:36:08.356
You try to learn about other religion,

00:36:08.557 --> 00:36:11.088
and you find the essence is the same in every religion.

00:36:11.363 --> 00:36:12.499
What is there to fight?

00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:14.373
And that’s how you belong to no religion,

00:36:14.574 --> 00:36:17.415
you belong to every religion. That’s what happens.

00:36:17.616 --> 00:36:20.584
But My parents were very enlightened people, I must say,

00:36:20.785 --> 00:36:24.531
and I was very lucky to choose them as My parents.

00:36:25.584 --> 00:36:28.078
You have been an enlightened child, is it correct?

00:36:28.279 --> 00:36:30.775
- I beg your pardon?
- You had been an enlightened child?

00:36:30.976 --> 00:36:32.838
Yes, I have been born as an enlightened child.

00:36:33.039 --> 00:36:35.990
But You don’t feel sometimes very lonesome,

00:36:36.191 --> 00:36:40.791
because all the others are different?

00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:44.830
No, no, that is, you see, if you know how to share with others...

00:36:45.031 --> 00:36:48.846
Actually I was like a Mother to them from My very childhood.

00:36:49.047 --> 00:36:51.329
When My father, mother went to jail I was,

00:36:51.530 --> 00:36:54.414
first time, I was about, I think five and a half years of age.

00:36:54.615 --> 00:36:59.252
So I had all the keys of the house in My little frock thing,

00:36:59.453 --> 00:37:02.534
and I used to carry all the duties like a grandmother.

00:37:02.735 --> 00:37:04.565
I never felt lost. I mean,

00:37:04.766 --> 00:37:07.314
My life is on the whole is very collective,

00:37:07.515 --> 00:37:09.978
by temperament I am extremely collective.

00:37:10.179 --> 00:37:12.595
I can live anywhere. I can sleep anywhere.

00:37:12.796 --> 00:37:14.685
I can live in the jungles. I can...

00:37:14.886 --> 00:37:18.500
I have no problems of that. I am extremely collective.

00:37:18.701 --> 00:37:22.199
I am not exclusive by temperament, from very childhood.

00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:24.973
I was very friendly with all the people

00:37:25.174 --> 00:37:27.305
in that area where we were living

00:37:27.506 --> 00:37:29.772
and My mother was known as Nirmala’s mother,

00:37:29.973 --> 00:37:31.551
father was known as Nirmala’s father.

00:37:31.752 --> 00:37:34.463
So they said, “We have lost our identity because of Her”.

00:37:34.664 --> 00:37:38.196
So I was a very friendly person. I never felt lonely,

00:37:38.397 --> 00:37:40.963
and when I am with Myself I am never lonely at all.

00:37:41.164 --> 00:37:43.801
I enjoy Myself very much.

00:37:46.144 --> 00:37:50.082
When You had been to the ashram with Gandhi,

00:37:50.283 --> 00:37:54.471
can You mention one or two impressions You remember

00:37:54.672 --> 00:37:56.826
about Gandhi?

00:37:57.027 --> 00:37:58.652
Oh! Gandhiji was a tremendous man.

00:37:58.853 --> 00:38:00.915
One has to learn a lot from him.

00:38:01.116 --> 00:38:04.628
He was not at all a hypocrite, that’s one thing.

00:38:04.829 --> 00:38:09.112
And he was not like modern, we say, politicians,

00:38:09.313 --> 00:38:13.074
who says something, do something. No, he was very outspoken

00:38:13.275 --> 00:38:17.415
and always put himself on the testing point.

00:38:17.624 --> 00:38:21.608
And he used to confess if he made mistakes, immediately.

00:38:21.809 --> 00:38:26.093
One very great incident I remember, when I was a small child.

00:38:26.294 --> 00:38:29.559
They were having a meeting together

00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:33.377
and we girls were there only sitting giving them

00:38:33.578 --> 00:38:35.431
water and things, to all the people.

00:38:35.632 --> 00:38:39.000
All the big people were there, like...

00:38:39.209 --> 00:38:42.392
Jawaharlal Lal Nehru was there and also Maulana Azad,

00:38:42.593 --> 00:38:44.454
all these people were sitting there.

00:38:44.655 --> 00:38:47.627
They were discussing something and then suddenly

00:38:47.828 --> 00:38:51.790
Mahatmaji said that, “Now it’s very late. We’ll have lunch here.”

00:38:52.460 --> 00:38:55.352
So they said, “Yes, yes, we’ll have lunch here.”

00:38:55.553 --> 00:38:58.210
They had to go to the guest house which was far away.

00:38:58.411 --> 00:39:03.707
So Mahatmaji asked for the Baa, is his wife. She had gone out.

00:39:03.908 --> 00:39:05.989
So he got up. He had a key with him,

00:39:06.190 --> 00:39:07.908
you see, always of the store room.

00:39:08.075 --> 00:39:09.312
He opened the store room,

00:39:09.513 --> 00:39:13.013
and he asked the people who were in charge of cooking

00:39:13.214 --> 00:39:14.871
to measure everything

00:39:15.072 --> 00:39:18.901
according to the people there are, properly, everything, you see.

00:39:19.102 --> 00:39:22.611
And then he, and they measured it out, everything was done

00:39:22.812 --> 00:39:24.051
then he put the key back,

00:39:24.252 --> 00:39:26.557
and then he went and sat there nicely.

00:39:26.774 --> 00:39:28.461
So these people said,

00:39:28.662 --> 00:39:31.950
“Bapu, we did not know you had to take so much trouble,

00:39:32.151 --> 00:39:36.260
you see, to go all the way and measure out everything out for us.”

00:39:36.461 --> 00:39:39.220
It did not take much time, about fifteen minutes, but still.

00:39:39.421 --> 00:39:41.574
So he said, “What do you think?

00:39:41.775 --> 00:39:46.099
This is the blood of my country. I cannot allow it to be wasted”.

00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:49.160
See, that’s the sign of a person who understands

00:39:49.361 --> 00:39:53.307
the value of public money. That’s just ingrained in him,

00:39:53.508 --> 00:39:57.053
but those who saw him also felt

00:39:57.285 --> 00:40:01.186
that, "Look at this man, who is living like an ascetic, absolutely,

00:40:01.387 --> 00:40:04.422
in the sense that he would not touch the public money".

00:40:04.623 --> 00:40:08.136
And that is one of the key, keys for all the leaders.

00:40:08.337 --> 00:40:11.975
If they are absolutely above the money,

00:40:12.176 --> 00:40:16.438
then only people will respect; otherwise, there is no way out.

00:40:16.639 --> 00:40:18.528
But you find these days in every country

00:40:18.729 --> 00:40:21.586
so much of corruption, hypocrisy,

00:40:21.777 --> 00:40:23.797
then you are really shocked.

00:40:23.998 --> 00:40:26.049
What do You think is the reason

00:40:26.312 --> 00:40:30.557
of all these corruption, of the political instability?

00:40:31.214 --> 00:40:34.426
It’s ignorance. It is ignorance.

00:40:34.662 --> 00:40:39.673
They think by having money or by having big position

00:40:39.874 --> 00:40:44.631
or by having a big name, they’ll be happy.

00:40:44.832 --> 00:40:48.129
They will not be happy. Only the ego will be pampered.

00:40:48.330 --> 00:40:51.547
When it is slightly hurt, the person will be unhappy.

00:40:51.748 --> 00:40:54.936
So he’ll be going into from happiness to unhappiness.

00:40:55.137 --> 00:40:57.732
But when he gets the knowledge

00:40:57.931 --> 00:41:01.271
that it is the Spirit which is the source of joy,

00:41:01.472 --> 00:41:04.885
then he doesn’t care for money, he doesn’t care for all these things.

00:41:05.086 --> 00:41:07.801
He is not afraid of anything. He lives like a Lord himself.

00:41:08.002 --> 00:41:10.120
He is a Lord, he doesn’t want anything.

00:41:10.319 --> 00:41:12.879
You see, the one who is the Lord doesn’t want anything.

00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:16.060
For example, now, as you know, I come from a rich family,

00:41:16.261 --> 00:41:17.877
my husband from a rich family.

00:41:18.132 --> 00:41:21.450
He’s now well to do. We have very comfortable living,

00:41:21.668 --> 00:41:25.052
but I can live in a, on a street, I can sleep on a street,

00:41:25.253 --> 00:41:28.663
because I am like a queen. I don’t need anything.

00:41:28.864 --> 00:41:31.068
If you need anything then you are a beggar,

00:41:31.269 --> 00:41:33.290
otherwise you are a king, isn’t it?

00:41:33.491 --> 00:41:36.851
That’s what I feel. So that is what is the ignorance.

00:41:37.052 --> 00:41:41.412
Once they know we are just fighting our ignorance

00:41:41.613 --> 00:41:43.277
they’ll give it up. It’s nonsense.

00:41:43.478 --> 00:41:46.154
It is nonsense and it’s not at all joy giving.

00:41:46.355 --> 00:41:48.776
Your virtues are very joy giving.

00:41:48.977 --> 00:41:54.149
If you know about your chastity, or you know about your honesty,

00:41:54.350 --> 00:41:57.164
or if you know about your straightforwardness,

00:41:57.365 --> 00:41:58.766
it’s very joy giving.

00:41:58.967 --> 00:42:01.031
You feel so confident, so happy

00:42:01.232 --> 00:42:03.758
and such a person never tries to harm anyone,

00:42:03.959 --> 00:42:05.381
to be sarcastic with anyone.

00:42:05.582 --> 00:42:07.459
Such a person is absolutely free, I should say,

00:42:07.660 --> 00:42:09.989
because he has no bondages of any kind.

00:42:10.190 --> 00:42:12.409
These are all bondages which bind us

00:42:12.610 --> 00:42:15.480
and we become jealous and we become greedy,

00:42:15.681 --> 00:42:18.550
we become lusty. All this is nonsense.

00:42:19.285 --> 00:42:21.972
It’s to be just seen after getting to your Spirit

00:42:22.173 --> 00:42:24.741
that the light shows these are all like snakes, you see,

00:42:24.942 --> 00:42:27.752
crawling up on us and we are holding on to snakes.

00:42:27.953 --> 00:42:31.323
People when they die, you see - big, big people I have seen -

00:42:31.524 --> 00:42:33.326
people tell about them.

00:42:33.501 --> 00:42:35.977
In the history they go down as horrible people.

00:42:36.278 --> 00:42:38.827
In the history they are described as people who were hypocrites,

00:42:39.028 --> 00:42:44.932
who were cruel, who were very, I should say, adamant type,

00:42:45.133 --> 00:42:46.793
and all kinds of things is described.

00:42:46.994 --> 00:42:50.222
Whatever is genuine remains genuine.

00:42:52.288 --> 00:42:55.439
You never, don’t feel frightened?

00:42:55.621 --> 00:43:00.361
No, I don’t. I don’t know anything like fear.

00:43:00.847 --> 00:43:04.479
What’s there to be afraid of?

00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:06.259
I am never afraid of,

00:43:06.460 --> 00:43:10.992
because if you believe and you know definitely there is God all over,

00:43:11.193 --> 00:43:12.947
there is nothing to be afraid of.

00:43:13.148 --> 00:43:16.335
He looks after you every moment, every minute.

00:43:16.536 --> 00:43:18.297
Wherever you are, He looks after you.

00:43:18.498 --> 00:43:21.096
These people have had so many experiences of that.

00:43:21.297 --> 00:43:24.790
There was one girl who was a Sahaja Yogini

00:43:24.991 --> 00:43:29.790
and she was driving somewhere in Germany on an Autobahn,

00:43:29.991 --> 00:43:31.716
and there were so many cars were with her.

00:43:31.917 --> 00:43:33.968
And suddenly her brake failed

00:43:34.169 --> 00:43:36.029
and the car started going this way, that way.

00:43:36.230 --> 00:43:38.897
She didn’t know how to manage it. She said, “Now, what to do?”

00:43:39.098 --> 00:43:41.625
She just... She had another one also with her.

00:43:41.826 --> 00:43:42.897
Both of them, they said,

00:43:43.098 --> 00:43:45.140
“All right, let us close our eyes and think of Mother.”

00:43:45.341 --> 00:43:47.560
They just started thinking of Me and said,

00:43:47.761 --> 00:43:50.190
“We’ll not be afraid, just think of Her”.

00:43:50.398 --> 00:43:52.952
And suddenly they found that their car had come

00:43:53.153 --> 00:43:58.256
to one side of the road very nicely without any scratch.

00:43:58.774 --> 00:44:04.272
So, you see, it is just our fear makes us more frantic and stupid.

00:44:04.473 --> 00:44:06.892
There is nothing to be afraid of.

00:44:07.093 --> 00:44:09.213
It is to be seen how God helps you.

00:44:09.414 --> 00:44:11.635
But people don’t want to take His help, you see.

00:44:11.836 --> 00:44:15.831
Then God says, “All right, go ahead and break your head. What to do?”

00:44:17.477 --> 00:44:20.276
Sometimes other people are helping.

00:44:20.477 --> 00:44:23.204
Yes, then you should know how to handle them.

00:44:23.405 --> 00:44:26.005
You see, they, for example, yesterday that fellow came.

00:44:26.206 --> 00:44:28.115
You see, he just became like a beaten up dog.

00:44:28.316 --> 00:44:31.489
You saw him coming and saying something to Me, which you never heard.

00:44:31.690 --> 00:44:34.793
But they belong to a cult, some sort of a cult, you see,

00:44:34.994 --> 00:44:38.722
and they always oppose us. They have some sort of Christians.

00:44:38.923 --> 00:44:43.713
And when I was in Geneva, one of the ladies,

00:44:43.914 --> 00:44:48.966
all, you see, dressed up in a very fashionable way,

00:44:49.167 --> 00:44:52.366
she came to Me with a Bible in her hand to hit me, you see.

00:44:52.567 --> 00:44:55.919
And everybody got frightened that now she is going to beat Me.

00:44:56.120 --> 00:44:59.396
This woman walked with big high heels upon Me

00:44:59.597 --> 00:45:02.398
and I dont know, they thought she’ll do something to Me.

00:45:02.599 --> 00:45:04.578
As soon as I saw her with the Bible, you know,

00:45:04.785 --> 00:45:06.425
I started laughing, absolutely.

00:45:06.626 --> 00:45:09.072
I couldn’t bear. I thought, “Such a joker she is.

00:45:09.273 --> 00:45:11.772
She is coming to hit Me with a Bible? How can she do it?”

00:45:11.973 --> 00:45:15.008
And she got worried about Me that I am laughing so much.

00:45:15.209 --> 00:45:16.421
It’s all on the tape.

00:45:16.622 --> 00:45:18.744
And these boys were very much frightened, I've seen.

00:45:18.945 --> 00:45:21.410
I was not at all. I said, “It’s perfectly all right,”

00:45:21.611 --> 00:45:23.814
and she ran away because she saw Me laughing, you know.

00:45:24.015 --> 00:45:27.295
I just couldn’t help [unclear] laughing at the joker,

00:45:27.496 --> 00:45:30.904
the way she came to hit Me with a Bible. Imagine!

00:45:31.105 --> 00:45:33.303
So this is what it is. If you are afraid

00:45:33.504 --> 00:45:36.873
then they sit on your heads. But you should not be afraid.

00:45:38.396 --> 00:45:42.978
There's a chinese story that there's one king who took two,

00:45:43.179 --> 00:45:49.454
two cocks for fighting to a very realised soul, a guru,

00:45:49.655 --> 00:45:52.383
and he said, "You make them all right".

00:45:52.584 --> 00:45:54.883
So he said "All right". He trained them for one month,

00:45:55.084 --> 00:45:56.617
and they went for a fight.

00:45:56.843 --> 00:46:00.696
So many cocks were brought him to fight these.

00:46:00.897 --> 00:46:02.699
So these two were standing there,

00:46:02.867 --> 00:46:05.325
they would no attack anyone, just standing.

00:46:05.526 --> 00:46:07.559
Everybody was attacking, they were just standing.

00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:09.359
Everybody got frightened, all the,

00:46:09.560 --> 00:46:12.072
all the cocks got frightened and ran away.

00:46:12.273 --> 00:46:15.426
And these two were standing there nicely.

00:46:16.966 --> 00:46:21.455
You should not attack anyone, nor anybody would attack you.

00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:24.935
Yes, they are there, but quite alright.

00:46:25.136 --> 00:46:26.797
But I am not frightened of them.

00:46:26.998 --> 00:46:30.827
So far nobody has been successful.

00:46:41.525 --> 00:46:47.265
P: I request Mataji, if Mataji can explain how to raise the Kundalini,

00:46:47.466 --> 00:46:50.312
that may help the guests also.

00:46:50.513 --> 00:46:54.472
Explain how to raise the Kundalini.
P: Yes

00:47:02.890 --> 00:47:07.228
He wants to know how the Kundalini is raised.

00:47:07.429 --> 00:47:11.084
As they explained the, yesterday in German language,

00:47:11.293 --> 00:47:15.117
that at the base of our spine,

00:47:15.318 --> 00:47:18.662
there is a power lying there,

00:47:18.863 --> 00:47:22.226
which is the reflection of the Holy Ghost within us.

00:47:22.427 --> 00:47:24.956
And the Spirit lies in the heart

00:47:25.157 --> 00:47:28.078
which is the reflection of God Almighty.

00:47:28.279 --> 00:47:33.578
So the power of God is the Holy Ghost, is a female power,

00:47:33.779 --> 00:47:38.715
because God is a male,

00:47:38.916 --> 00:47:43.519
then He has a son. There has to be a Mother to the son.

00:47:45.486 --> 00:47:47.862
They didn't want to have a woman there, imagine.

00:47:48.063 --> 00:47:50.689
We cannot have women for...

00:47:50.890 --> 00:47:53.185
They cannot be ordained. This is too much.

00:47:53.386 --> 00:47:55.224
It's not in India like this, you see.

00:47:55.375 --> 00:47:57.330
You don't find this kind of a nonsense there

00:47:57.531 --> 00:48:00.380
but is here that women have accepted, though you are so advanced.

00:48:00.596 --> 00:48:03.351
There, here it is so stupid that women cannot become priests.

00:48:03.552 --> 00:48:06.365
Why can't they if the men can be?

00:48:06.566 --> 00:48:10.859
So, this, to avoid the women from the whole thing,

00:48:11.060 --> 00:48:16.213
they called It a Holy Ghost, without telling that it's a female.

00:48:16.414 --> 00:48:18.825
And that female power is the Shakti

00:48:19.026 --> 00:48:22.060
which resides in the triangular bone.

00:48:22.284 --> 00:48:29.855
Now, what happens, that when a person who is authorised,

00:48:30.056 --> 00:48:33.936
in a way that a person who is a realised soul,

00:48:35.144 --> 00:48:40.697
is faced by such a person, then the Kundalini spontaneously rises.

00:48:40.898 --> 00:48:48.505
Just like in the womb of the Mother Earth if you put any seed,

00:48:48.706 --> 00:48:53.328
spontaneously it sprouts because it's a living process.

00:48:53.573 --> 00:48:56.545
And it passes through the six chakras.

00:48:56.746 --> 00:48:59.770
The seventh is the last chakra, which is the pelvic,

00:49:00.004 --> 00:49:01.472
which helps the pelvic plexus.

00:49:01.673 --> 00:49:03.924
So it doesn't play any part,

00:49:04.125 --> 00:49:07.990
means sex does not play any part in this. You become like a child.

00:49:08.191 --> 00:49:10.516
And the Kundalini passes through six centres

00:49:10.717 --> 00:49:12.767
ultimately the sixth one is here,

00:49:12.968 --> 00:49:18.152
which we call as Sahasrara, meaning thousand petaled lotus.

00:49:18.353 --> 00:49:20.589
But actually it is the limbic area,

00:49:20.790 --> 00:49:25.166
and at the apex of limbic area here, at the fontanel bone area,

00:49:25.367 --> 00:49:26.658
It pierces through,

00:49:26.859 --> 00:49:28.320
and you actually start feeling

00:49:28.521 --> 00:49:30.907
the cool breeze coming out of your head.

00:49:31.108 --> 00:49:33.002
Actually start feeling like that.

00:49:33.203 --> 00:49:36.274
So, it just sprouts by itself,

00:49:36.425 --> 00:49:39.247
it is a spontaneous happening.

00:49:43.115 --> 00:49:45.676
Did you understand?

00:49:45.877 --> 00:49:49.093
You are from the country of Krishna, You should know many things.

00:49:49.294 --> 00:49:52.242
After coming here, you people have forgotten God.

00:49:53.079 --> 00:49:54.261
Is it true or not?
