00:00.794 --> 00:02.759
Can we start with Your childhood?

00:02.960 --> 00:05.142
-Yes.
- Do You, can describe a little bit

00:05.343 --> 00:08.659
the circumstances where you were grown up?

00:08.860 --> 00:12.123
- My family?
- Yes.

00:16.461 --> 00:22.931
I belong to a family of very enlightened people.

00:23.132 --> 00:27.760
My father was a linguist

00:27.951 --> 00:30.854
and he was master of fourteen languages.

00:31.055 --> 00:34.167
He knew about twenty-six languages

00:34.368 --> 00:41.467
and he translated even Koran-e-Sharif into Hindi language.

00:41.668 --> 00:46.920
My Mother was in those days

00:47.121 --> 00:51.041
was a honors in mathematics.

00:51.242 --> 00:57.500
So both were very well educated and enlightened people.

01:01.121 --> 01:05.399
At the time of My birth,

01:05.700 --> 01:08.581
My mother dreamt

01:09.823 --> 01:12.168
something which she could not explain,

01:12.369 --> 01:16.553
but after that she had a great desire to go and see a tiger

01:16.754 --> 01:19.299
in the open field.

01:19.500 --> 01:21.913
My father was a great hunter,

01:22.104 --> 01:25.819
because tigers were a menace in the area where we were living.

01:26.020 --> 01:30.292
It was a hill station called Chhindwara.

01:30.493 --> 01:34.460
So there was a king who was very much interested in My father.

01:34.661 --> 01:36.801
Somehow or the other a letter came that

01:37.002 --> 01:40.949
there’s a tiger, a very big tiger that has appeared

01:41.150 --> 01:45.413
and they are frightened of him that he might be a man-eater.

01:45.614 --> 01:51.412
So My father took My Mother and Me to that place.

01:52.099 --> 01:55.055
And they were sitting what we call as a machhan,

01:55.256 --> 02:00.972
where they built something, for people to sit on top of a tree,

02:01.173 --> 02:04.997
from where they can shoot nicely.

02:06.534 --> 02:09.895
And then My mother tells Me that a big huge tiger

02:10.096 --> 02:15.792
of a very big size, very beautifully appeared on the field.

02:15.993 --> 02:19.683
And she felt tremendous love for the tiger.

02:19.884 --> 02:25.522
It was a full moon day and she felt

02:26.492 --> 02:29.902
extremely compassionate towards the tiger.

02:30.103 --> 02:33.089
And when My father raised his gun to shoot,

02:33.290 --> 02:35.826
she stopped him and she wouldn’t allow him.

02:36.027 --> 02:41.019
And the tiger went away and he never came to that forest again.

02:41.950 --> 02:44.401
But that made My father think -

02:44.602 --> 02:47.523
because he himself was a realized soul -

02:47.650 --> 02:51.836
that must be somebody,

02:52.037 --> 02:57.516
what we call a Goddess Durga who is fond of  a tiger

02:57.717 --> 03:01.041
must be born to My mother,

03:01.146 --> 03:03.818
because the symptoms were rather funny

03:04.019 --> 03:06.768
that a lady should like to see a tiger and all.

03:06.969 --> 03:09.265
So he told My mother, “Now are you satisfied?”

03:09.466 --> 03:11.205
because they were struggling with the gun.

03:11.332 --> 03:14.156
He said, “Is there a Durga sitting in your womb

03:14.357 --> 03:17.785
that you are trying to protect the tiger?”

03:17.986 --> 03:21.625
She said, “Yes, yes, so stop it now. I won’t allow you.”

03:22.185 --> 03:24.505
Like that there were many incidents in My life

03:24.706 --> 03:29.617
because I am of a Christian family – protestants –

03:29.818 --> 03:33.278
and when I was born My mother didn’t feel any labor pains or anything

03:33.479 --> 03:35.951
and just I was born; she didn’t know how.

03:36.223 --> 03:40.518
And I had no blood on My body, nothing, I was clean washed.

03:40.719 --> 03:44.031
That’s why they called My name as Nirmala.

03:45.039 --> 03:49.856
But My grandmother said that She should be called as Nishkalanka,

03:50.075 --> 03:52.358
that means the one which has no spots on it.

03:52.559 --> 03:54.535
But that’s the name of man.

03:54.736 --> 03:56.675
So they said, “All right, we'll call Her Nirmala

03:56.876 --> 03:59.436
meaning the same, Immaculata.”

04:00.699 --> 04:04.712
Now all these incidents, and then My Father being a realized soul,

04:04.913 --> 04:08.130
he felt tremendous vibrations from Me,

04:08.373 --> 04:11.801
and he felt that this life is great

04:11.986 --> 04:17.330
and She will do something great in this life.

04:17.957 --> 04:19.528
I do not know why, but

04:19.729 --> 04:23.018
I don’t know if he dreamt or he understood it, but

04:23.219 --> 04:26.113
all the time if I remember when he talked to Me,

04:26.314 --> 04:29.433
he used to say that, "You have to find out a way

04:29.634 --> 04:33.710
of giving en masse Realization, all the time".

04:33.911 --> 04:37.439
As I told you, he was a great scholar of so many things,

04:37.640 --> 04:40.599
and a very widely read man.

04:40.800 --> 04:45.606
So he gave Me a good education in religion,

04:45.807 --> 04:47.611
in different religions,

04:47.812 --> 04:51.028
and also good education about human beings,

04:51.229 --> 04:52.950
what are their problems,

04:53.151 --> 04:56.295
why they react like this, why don’t they take to God,

04:56.496 --> 04:58.324
why are they hypocritical.

04:58.607 --> 05:01.387
All kinds of things he talked to Me.

05:01.615 --> 05:04.724
He also knew about Kundalini, but not so much.

05:05.248 --> 05:08.127
Of course, when I was born

05:08.328 --> 05:11.411
I knew about Kundalini myself.

05:11.612 --> 05:13.903
I knew all about it from My very childhood.

05:14.104 --> 05:17.165
I was a very aware person, extremely aware.

05:17.366 --> 05:18.789
But I didn’t know whom to talk to

05:18.990 --> 05:21.331
because, see, people didn’t have that awareness.

05:21.532 --> 05:24.004
You can’t talk to everyone like that.

05:24.205 --> 05:26.523
So I was regarded as a very jolly person,

05:26.724 --> 05:31.211
at the same time very serious also, very deep,

05:31.412 --> 05:35.148
and then I started my studies as a child.

05:37.134 --> 05:38.568
I was not very much interested

05:38.769 --> 05:41.565
in the studies but I used to do very well,

05:41.766 --> 05:45.928
but I used to read lives of great men and things like that.

05:46.129 --> 05:49.595
At a very young age I read Bernard Shaw.

05:49.796 --> 05:52.276
When people were reading just Great Expectations,

05:52.477 --> 05:54.674
I was reading Bernard Shaw.

05:54.875 --> 05:58.378
But as such I didn’t have interest in particularly reading

05:58.592 --> 06:01.359
some text books because I thought they were childish,

06:01.560 --> 06:04.566
and there is nothing to be read about it.

06:04.767 --> 06:07.127
Then I told My father that “I have to do medicine.”

06:07.328 --> 06:10.545
So he said, “Why?” I said, “Because I have to talk to doctors.”

06:10.746 --> 06:13.714
He said, “You have to talk to doctors?” “Yes”, I said.

06:13.915 --> 06:16.121
But it so happened in My childhood

06:16.322 --> 06:19.049
when I was about seven years of age,

06:19.250 --> 06:21.153
My father was a congressman,

06:21.354 --> 06:24.375
he had joined Congress when I was four years of age.

06:24.576 --> 06:26.944
He used to live with a style, very westernized.

06:27.145 --> 06:29.786
His clothes were stitched in London, sort of a man.

06:30.313 --> 06:32.029
We had governesses and all that.

06:32.230 --> 06:35.918
He threw away everything and he became a real Indian

06:36.119 --> 06:40.089
and started leading a life of a martyr.

06:41.669 --> 06:46.500
Then he made us study our languages, Sanskrit...

06:46.700 --> 06:50.675
He made Me study in an Indian school, not in a missionary school,

06:50.876 --> 06:53.043
because missionaries were very unkind.

06:53.244 --> 06:56.130
They threw us out of the school when My father was in the Congress.

06:56.331 --> 06:58.844
They were against us completely.

06:59.664 --> 07:04.537
Then at the age of seven years I happened to go with My Father

07:04.720 --> 07:08.097
to Mahatma Gandhi.

07:08.298 --> 07:10.717
He was about seventy miles, living with us,

07:10.918 --> 07:13.013
but the first time he took Me down.

07:13.214 --> 07:14.804
And Mahatma Gandhi liked Me very much.

07:15.005 --> 07:17.170
He said, “Leave this child with me.”

07:17.371 --> 07:20.153
So, I had not even taken clothes or anything. I stayed on;

07:20.416 --> 07:25.422
then My Father sent Me everything with him.

07:25.646 --> 07:28.846
And he was very fond of Me, but I was a little girl,

07:29.047 --> 07:31.587
but he understood that there was something about Me.

07:31.788 --> 07:36.688
He consulted Me on very serious problems sometimes, surprisingly.

07:36.889 --> 07:39.297
Like one day he wanted to

07:39.498 --> 07:42.331
make the Prayer Book all right.

07:42.696 --> 07:45.908
So, he asked Me, “How should I put the series?” and all that.

07:46.109 --> 07:48.506
So I told him how to put the series

07:48.707 --> 07:51.449
and he put the series in that way.

07:51.650 --> 07:56.168
I used to go back for My school and again go back to Gandhiji,

07:56.369 --> 08:00.273
every year, like that. And he called Me Nepali.

08:00.474 --> 08:02.149
He'd given Me a name Nepali.

08:02.350 --> 08:05.195
Everybody used to call Me Nepali that time.

08:05.832 --> 08:10.009
Then I grew up with him very intimately.

08:10.210 --> 08:12.645
He was a very, very kind person for children,

08:12.846 --> 08:14.916
otherwise an extremely strict man,

08:15.117 --> 08:19.349
with himself and with others, very strict, a big disciplinarian.

08:19.550 --> 08:23.094
And he would make everybody get up at four o’clock,

08:23.295 --> 08:26.920
have your baths, everything, be ready for your morning prayers

08:27.121 --> 08:29.407
at five o’clock, you see, and he used to walk very fast.

08:29.608 --> 08:31.361
I also learnt walking fast with him.

08:31.562 --> 08:34.224
In his company I had to walk fast.

08:34.473 --> 08:38.116
And he was extremely loving and a very nice person,

08:38.317 --> 08:41.044
and he would listen to Me because I was a child, you see.

08:41.245 --> 08:43.285
Supposing I forced him to eat more or something,

08:43.486 --> 08:46.199
then he would, in laugh he would accept.

08:46.400 --> 08:48.332
Very kindly person.

08:48.533 --> 08:51.099
But with others was very strict, and I used to tell him that,

08:51.300 --> 08:53.847
“Why are you strict with everyone?”

08:54.250 --> 08:57.043
He said, “But You are a little girl, You get up in the morning time.

08:57.244 --> 08:59.893
Why can’t they get up?” I said, “I am little. That’s why I get up.

09:00.094 --> 09:04.499
They are big so they can’t get up”; like that, you see, little chats.

09:04.900 --> 09:06.960
And then My father went to jail

09:07.161 --> 09:08.887
and My mother also went to jail five times.

09:09.088 --> 09:11.299
My father went to jail twice,

09:11.500 --> 09:13.308
once for about two and a half years,

09:13.509 --> 09:16.498
and he was the only supporting member of the family.

09:16.769 --> 09:20.573
By the way, we come from a very old royal family,

09:20.790 --> 09:26.065
which is called as Shalivahanas. They have a Calendar also in India.

09:26.266 --> 09:32.699
And then when we, I mean when they took My father to jail,

09:32.900 --> 09:35.437
we had to leave our house and we had to live in huts

09:35.638 --> 09:38.390
and in all problems, that was nothing.

09:38.591 --> 09:39.751
But also Me

09:39.950 --> 09:42.695
they pestered a lot, because I helped many people there

09:42.896 --> 09:45.854
and I joined the ’42 movement in a very serious way

09:46.055 --> 09:48.242
and I became the leader here for the young people.

09:48.443 --> 09:52.040
I thought unless and until I take a very positive stand,

09:52.241 --> 09:54.873
it may not work out with them.

09:56.600 --> 10:00.605
It’s not gracious to say how they tortured Me, what they did to Me,

10:00.806 --> 10:02.063
but they really tortured Me.

10:02.264 --> 10:05.443
I was a young girl of nineteen years that time.

10:06.001 --> 10:10.274
It is over now. So, it’s finished, and after that we,

10:10.475 --> 10:12.965
My father went to jail again

10:13.140 --> 10:15.057
and then when he came back

10:15.258 --> 10:20.081
he got elected as the member of the Central Assembly later on,

10:20.282 --> 10:24.030
as the Constituent Assembly and then at the Parliament.

10:24.231 --> 10:27.887
My brother was also a member of the Parliament, later on.

10:28.088 --> 10:33.022
Now, recently, he was the Minister in the Cabinet.

10:33.223 --> 10:37.839
Another brother is a High Court judge in Bombay.

10:38.040 --> 10:40.080
They are all doing well, despite the fact

10:40.281 --> 10:43.337
that our parents neglected us in a way

10:43.538 --> 10:45.534
because they gave their lives for the country

10:45.735 --> 10:48.670
but, you see, that never deterred us from studies

10:48.871 --> 10:51.050
and we came up very well.

10:51.313 --> 10:53.772
Then I, when I was in the ’42 movement, you see,

10:53.973 --> 10:55.867
My college rusticated Me

10:56.129 --> 10:58.351
– from the college they threw Me out

10:58.552 --> 11:01.516
and I had to go to another college to study

11:01.667 --> 11:05.534
far away from My house, in Punjab,

11:05.735 --> 11:08.686
where I studied for two years.

11:08.798 --> 11:12.797
Science I did, then I did my medical.

11:13.158 --> 11:18.530
I didn’t do fully because, just after that the ’47 riots broke out,

11:18.731 --> 11:20.982
so our college was closed and I didn’t want to know more

11:21.183 --> 11:23.876
because what I wanted to know I came to know about it.

11:24.139 --> 11:27.505
So I did not need and I got married.

11:28.500 --> 11:30.651
You must have heard My husband was, is now

11:30.852 --> 11:34.449
the Secretary-General of the International Maritime Organization.

11:34.650 --> 11:36.475
He held very high positions.

11:36.676 --> 11:40.525
He was also Secretary to Lal Bahadur Shastri,

11:40.726 --> 11:43.747
who was our Prime Minister, who was a another very great man,

11:43.987 --> 11:47.045
but he did not survive long. If he had survived

11:47.246 --> 11:49.705
things would have been different, I think, for our country

11:49.906 --> 11:52.847
because he was a Gandhian, out and out Gandhian,

11:53.048 --> 11:57.182
and he lived like an ideal Gandhian personality.

11:58.446 --> 12:02.047
So that’s how the life went on.

12:02.248 --> 12:07.694
But inner being was still seeking the way and methods

12:07.895 --> 12:10.357
of giving en masse Realization.

12:11.177 --> 12:16.389
My father said, “Before You do not develop this technique

12:16.590 --> 12:19.482
of giving en masse Realization, don’t talk of religion.

12:19.683 --> 12:22.180
Let nobody know that You know anything about it

12:22.381 --> 12:25.147
because they’ll crucify You,” or

12:25.348 --> 12:27.790
he was rather worried that people won’t understand

12:27.991 --> 12:30.071
or, ‘You may write another Bible or Geeta. No use.

12:30.272 --> 12:33.693
First of all you must give them Realization.

12:33.894 --> 12:35.556
If they get their Realization

12:35.757 --> 12:37.994
then they will realize that there is something about,

12:38.195 --> 12:41.158
above this human awareness”.

12:41.359 --> 12:43.996
For example, he always used to give an analogy -

12:44.197 --> 12:46.899
supposing you are born on the tenth storey

12:47.100 --> 12:48.685
and everybody is on the ground,

12:48.886 --> 12:51.364
you must at least make them climb two storeys,

12:51.565 --> 12:53.483
so they know there is something above it;

12:53.684 --> 12:55.650
otherwise no use talking about it.

12:55.946 --> 12:58.551
And he said this is the mistake

12:58.752 --> 13:01.529
between the saints and the incarnations was

13:01.730 --> 13:05.044
that they never realized that these people are still on the ground,

13:05.245 --> 13:09.191
they have to still enter into the building.

13:09.392 --> 13:11.523
So that is what you have to be very careful

13:11.724 --> 13:14.911
that first of all you must give Realization to people.

13:15.693 --> 13:18.790
So I was seeking the ways and methods,

13:18.991 --> 13:21.013
working it out inside Myself

13:21.214 --> 13:24.917
through My own style of meditation in the sense that

13:25.118 --> 13:27.533
I would work out all the permutations and combinations.

13:27.734 --> 13:30.761
Supposing I met one person, then I would see

13:30.962 --> 13:34.914
what problems that person had, how you can overcome it like that.

13:35.115 --> 13:38.629
I would try to study that person internally.

13:39.820 --> 13:42.321
And I went to many people to find out,

13:42.522 --> 13:44.889
but I found they were great hypocrites.

13:45.090 --> 13:46.696
I saw so many of these gurus.

13:46.897 --> 13:50.799
Most of them I saw them, I was surprised, they were all hypocrites,

13:51.000 --> 13:53.136
money-making and this thing.

13:53.337 --> 13:57.097
And also I went to Rajneesh also, to see him.

13:57.298 --> 14:01.034
Then he said that I should come to his program.

14:01.256 --> 14:02.557
I did not know what sort of man

14:02.758 --> 14:04.977
because he was talking about Geeta and big, big things.

14:05.178 --> 14:07.573
I thought he might be knowing something about it.

14:07.774 --> 14:09.338
I went there, but my husband said,

14:09.539 --> 14:11.203
“No, I won't allow You to go to his camp”

14:11.404 --> 14:13.847
So he arranged his own bungalow and all that for Me.

14:14.048 --> 14:15.484
So I went down there

14:15.685 --> 14:18.357
and there I couldn't see all the things that were going on

14:18.558 --> 14:20.636
and that is the day somehow or other

14:20.874 --> 14:24.950
I said I must open the last chakra. So the last chakra was opened.

14:25.151 --> 14:30.630
And I saw the Kundalini which is the Primordial force within us,

14:30.831 --> 14:34.536
which is the Holy Ghost within us,

14:34.704 --> 14:37.576
rising like a telescope, opening out,

14:38.236 --> 14:42.266
and then I saw the whole thing open

14:42.467 --> 14:46.486
and a big torrential rain of breeze

14:46.701 --> 14:49.755
started flowing through My head all over,

14:49.956 --> 14:52.794
as if, and I felt "I am lost now. I am no more there.

14:52.995 --> 14:55.826
It’s only the Grace is there, that is there."

14:56.027 --> 14:59.040
I saw it completely happening to Me.

14:59.241 --> 15:05.195
And, but I was amazed that when I went to Rajneesh, you see,

15:05.396 --> 15:07.129
because before going I had to say goodbye.

15:07.330 --> 15:09.621
He never realized what had happened or anything.

15:09.822 --> 15:10.920
So I was surprised.

15:11.121 --> 15:14.362
I said, “This man doesn’t know anything about God”,

15:14.563 --> 15:16.763
and then I discovered that they were all hypocrites

15:16.964 --> 15:18.569
and telling lies.

15:18.770 --> 15:24.484
So in 1973 this happened, on 5th of May

15:24.685 --> 15:27.368
’70, 1970, 5-th of May.

15:27.569 --> 15:29.448
And just after that

15:29.649 --> 15:33.508
we had a very big lecture in Jahangir Hall - there's a very big hall -

15:33.709 --> 15:36.663
and thousands of people had come. I told them very frankly

15:36.864 --> 15:39.491
that these are all thugs and these are like this, hypocrites.

15:39.692 --> 15:41.977
Some of them are demoniacs. Some are evil people.

15:42.178 --> 15:45.686
I took their names, everything. I told them, “Don’t go near them.”

15:45.887 --> 15:48.411
There were some foreigners also.

15:50.923 --> 15:54.463
And there were so many others whom I told these things very clearly,

15:54.664 --> 15:57.260
and they got frightened. They said, “You shouldn’t say like this.

15:57.461 --> 15:58.959
They’ll come and murder you. They’ll do..."

15:59.160 --> 16:00.682
”I said, “Let them come and murder Me.”

16:00.883 --> 16:04.639
But nobody did anything. Nobody even went to the courts.

16:04.840 --> 16:09.927
And that’s how, you see, they tried to bring bad name to Me.

16:10.128 --> 16:13.609
They paid money to the newspapers to publish things against Me,

16:13.810 --> 16:16.126
because I said, “You cannot pay money.”

16:16.327 --> 16:21.029
So they thought that I was just trying to, you see, harm them

16:21.230 --> 16:24.636
by saying such a thing that you can’t earn money in the name of God.

16:24.837 --> 16:29.062
If it’s a job you can do it, but God’s work is not a job.

16:29.263 --> 16:33.660
And the struggle started

16:33.897 --> 16:36.953
from the day I started giving Realization,

16:37.154 --> 16:41.317
and I started with one lady who got Realization first.

16:41.533 --> 16:45.374
Then we got about twelve people who got Realization.

16:45.575 --> 16:51.499
In two years I got only about fourteen people Realization.

16:51.828 --> 16:54.659
Then gradually when fourteen people got Realization then

16:54.860 --> 16:57.585
many others started getting Realization.

16:57.786 --> 17:02.916
But I started also curing people because that was helping a lot.

17:03.117 --> 17:07.613
Then My husband got elected to this post

17:07.814 --> 17:09.896
and we had to come to London.

17:10.097 --> 17:11.473
So when I came to London

17:11.674 --> 17:15.321
we had one program in Bhartiya Vidya Bhavan. They arranged it.

17:15.572 --> 17:18.693
So the Indians abroad are not so much interested in God;

17:18.894 --> 17:20.791
they are more interested in money.

17:20.992 --> 17:24.400
So none of the Indians stayed there. They all ran away.

17:24.649 --> 17:30.299
And only the foreigners who were there, were about seven hippies.

17:30.500 --> 17:32.429
So I had to work on them, seven hippies.

17:32.630 --> 17:36.433
For four years I was working on them, to give them Realization.

17:36.634 --> 17:39.145
Very difficult, you see. Their liver was bad.

17:39.346 --> 17:42.937
They had ill health. Their head was off, terrible times.

17:43.138 --> 17:45.229
But in between I used to go to India,

17:45.430 --> 17:47.261
and in India also the work was done.

17:47.462 --> 17:49.560
For three months always I would be in India.

17:49.761 --> 17:51.920
So we started working in the villages,

17:52.121 --> 17:55.160
specially surprisingly where My forefathers were ruling,

17:55.361 --> 17:58.669
in that area, the work started moving in a very big way.

17:58.870 --> 18:02.602
And there then we started taking some people from India.

18:02.803 --> 18:07.589
Then some people came from Australia to India, like that,

18:07.835 --> 18:11.974
and the work started moving in those directions.

18:12.175 --> 18:15.394
Then gradually the work improved and people found

18:15.595 --> 18:18.641
that this is the way we can transform ourselves.

18:18.842 --> 18:21.963
Many people who were taking drugs or alcoholic

18:22.164 --> 18:24.764
or mad people, or cancer people ,

18:24.965 --> 18:27.359
they felt better, then they got cured

18:27.560 --> 18:32.732
and it was established that Sahaja Yoga is something very important.

18:34.319 --> 18:37.313
Now when I travel all over the world,

18:37.514 --> 18:40.550
you see, first My husband used to pay for everything.

18:40.751 --> 18:43.156
Wherever I went, he had to pay all.

18:43.357 --> 18:45.537
Any expenses he used to do for Me.

18:45.738 --> 18:48.971
Gradually, then now, these people pay for My travel,

18:49.172 --> 18:53.104
but otherwise they don’t have to pay for anything else

18:53.330 --> 18:57.475
That’s how we started our work. There was lot of opposition

18:57.676 --> 19:02.077
and the media people would never understand it,

19:02.278 --> 19:06.293
because it was no such a sensation as you can say,

19:06.494 --> 19:08.222
nothing to people feel excited.

19:08.423 --> 19:09.942
But in a way it’s a very great thing,

19:10.143 --> 19:13.068
because if this is the solution for the whole world.

19:13.269 --> 19:15.031
One should try to do it.

19:15.232 --> 19:20.024
Then we had very great people who came to Sahaja Yoga,

19:20.225 --> 19:24.386
like, we can say,

19:24.587 --> 19:29.542
the Hague High Court judge, who is now the President,

19:29.817 --> 19:34.273
who has given Nicaragua, this thing judgment.

19:34.516 --> 19:38.602
He and many lawyers and many barristers.

19:38.803 --> 19:42.126
We have one barrister here from Algeria,

19:42.327 --> 19:44.680
and doctors, and then they took over

19:44.881 --> 19:49.393
and they started helping Me out how to propagate Sahaja Yoga.

19:51.001 --> 19:53.296
But it was a difficult task in the West.

19:53.497 --> 19:55.999
Of course, in India it spread very fast in the villages

19:56.200 --> 19:58.188
but city people in India also

19:58.419 --> 20:00.964
are westernized and they start analyzing.

20:01.165 --> 20:03.150
They don’t know much about our past.

20:03.351 --> 20:05.606
They don’t know anything about our heritage,

20:05.686 --> 20:08.207
that we have our Kundalini and all that.

20:08.408 --> 20:10.950
But some people do know about self-Realization.

20:11.151 --> 20:13.161
But these gurus could not stick on in India

20:13.362 --> 20:16.817
because nobody would accept them. So they all run away abroad.

20:17.057 --> 20:19.145
And that was something a blessing for Me also

20:19.346 --> 20:21.978
because I didn’t have to fight them there,

20:22.179 --> 20:24.691
and it started working out,

20:24.892 --> 20:27.474
and then people found that it helps in every way,

20:27.731 --> 20:30.392
and they found so many miracles about it,

20:30.593 --> 20:34.264
and that’s how Sahaja Yoga got settled quite a lot.

20:34.465 --> 20:36.486
But still I would say that

20:36.687 --> 20:39.202
we have not been to certain countries so far,

20:39.403 --> 20:44.148
and in the west, I would say that so much work has still to be done.

20:44.349 --> 20:47.462
Because as soon as you start any work in any place,

20:47.663 --> 20:50.819
first of all they want Me to cure people

20:51.020 --> 20:53.321
and to help them with curatives.

20:53.522 --> 20:56.101
Now if I pay attention more to that,

20:56.302 --> 21:00.119
then the main work is to create doctors out of everyone.

21:00.320 --> 21:02.826
That is neglected. Then you become unpopular.

21:03.027 --> 21:05.873
They think, “Oh, She is not sympathetic” and this and that.

21:06.074 --> 21:08.058
But now as we have, everybody can cure now,

21:08.259 --> 21:10.564
everyone. I don’t cure anyone directly.

21:10.765 --> 21:13.170
But they don’t like it. They want I should be there

21:13.371 --> 21:15.834
and their ego to be pampered and all those things are there.

21:16.035 --> 21:17.360
Rather difficult.

21:17.561 --> 21:20.124
It’s not, we are not running an election, you see,

21:20.325 --> 21:22.843
like we should please others sort of thing, is not there.

21:23.044 --> 21:25.142
But whatever is reality,

21:25.343 --> 21:30.059
if a person has intelligence – pure intelligence

21:30.260 --> 21:33.178
– he can see that this is something very different

21:33.379 --> 21:35.937
and for that one has to

21:36.138 --> 21:40.079
understand that you cannot,

21:40.280 --> 21:45.235
you cannot force on anyone that "You get your Realization".

21:45.436 --> 21:49.513
In the same way you cannot force Me that I give you Realization,

21:49.714 --> 21:51.603
because if it does not work, it does not work.

21:51.804 --> 21:53.321
It’s such a living force, you see.

21:53.522 --> 21:56.403
And that upsets them very soon.

21:56.604 --> 22:00.177
I feel that the way

22:00.378 --> 22:04.718
this industrial revolution has come in the west,

22:04.919 --> 22:08.417
people have lost their moorings, perhaps. They are so confused.

22:08.618 --> 22:11.517
With all these gurus coming down here confusing them

22:11.718 --> 22:16.211
and all kinds of new things coming, they don’t know where to look.

22:16.412 --> 22:20.344
But unless and until you get your evolution completed,

22:20.545 --> 22:24.121
unless and until you reach that absolute state of understanding,

22:24.322 --> 22:25.812
the chaos will remain.

22:26.013 --> 22:28.740
So one has to try to get to that.

22:28.941 --> 22:33.890
But one must understand you can’t pay for it. There is no effort.

22:34.091 --> 22:35.249
After getting Realization

22:35.450 --> 22:37.796
they feel so satisfied, they forget about it.

22:37.997 --> 22:40.662
But after that you must know how to give it to others.

22:40.863 --> 22:44.313
As Christ has said that the light which is enlightened,

22:44.514 --> 22:46.411
you do not put it under the table.

22:46.612 --> 22:48.408
That’s how what happens that,

22:48.609 --> 22:51.772
it's a, though we may give Realization at hundred people,

22:51.973 --> 22:55.806
only out of that five to six will come forward to help us out.

22:56.007 --> 22:58.513
But still I must say lot of work has been done.

22:58.714 --> 23:01.378
Especially Austria, I am very proud of Austria.

23:01.579 --> 23:06.629
And the way they have never given Me any problem – never –

23:06.834 --> 23:09.608
and very good people have come out of Austria.

23:09.808 --> 23:16.003
Very balanced, you see, level-headed people, very level-headed.

23:16.204 --> 23:18.861
They are not extremists. They do not go to extremes.

23:19.062 --> 23:23.099
There is no fanaticism about them. They are sensible people,

23:23.300 --> 23:27.714
and something so lucky that Austria was found out

23:27.915 --> 23:31.154
because I never expected that in Austria

23:31.355 --> 23:33.654
there will be so many people. But somehow

23:33.855 --> 23:38.106
like water finds its own level, Sahaja Yoga finds its own level.

23:38.307 --> 23:40.191
We just came down to Austria.

23:40.392 --> 23:44.892
We haven’t been to Norway, to Sweden, Denmark, Finland.

23:45.093 --> 23:48.148
I visited those places because of My husband’s job

23:48.349 --> 23:50.521
but I have not been there.

23:50.722 --> 23:57.014
Now we have sixteen centers in Australia,

23:57.215 --> 24:00.255
and Australia is a very progressive Sahaja Yoga thing.

24:00.456 --> 24:03.327
We have got schools now there. They are running schools

24:03.528 --> 24:10.243
and the teachers are extremely well-behaved and visionaries,

24:10.444 --> 24:12.796
and they look after the children very well.

24:13.042 --> 24:17.744
The Government people sent somebody for observation

24:17.945 --> 24:20.900
and they have remarked that whatever they proclaim,

24:21.101 --> 24:22.649
that’s what they manifest,

24:22.850 --> 24:25.727
and they have given good certificates to us.

24:25.928 --> 24:29.534
But the greatest achievement on the outward life is this,

24:29.735 --> 24:33.027
that Cambridge University has accepted Sahaja Yoga

24:33.228 --> 24:36.991
for a research work, with respect, by one Dr. Lee,

24:37.192 --> 24:39.951
who is doing the research about Sahaja Yoga in Cambridge University.

24:40.152 --> 24:41.291
He is already a Doctor.

24:41.492 --> 24:45.442
And there is another great thing has happened in Delhi University,

24:45.643 --> 24:48.651
that the Delhi University has accepted

24:48.852 --> 24:54.653
that a person can do, only a doctor can do, a PhD,

24:54.854 --> 24:57.623
or we can say the Doctorate in Sahaja Yoga,

24:57.841 --> 25:03.912
and he gets the highest degree called the Doctor of Medicine,

25:04.113 --> 25:08.754
and perhaps maybe after sometime they will allow anyone to do that.

25:08.955 --> 25:10.746
This is about the medicine part of it.

25:10.947 --> 25:13.619
In agriculture we have done lots of research, Myself.

25:13.820 --> 25:16.894
We have somebody here, an expert on agriculture.

25:17.095 --> 25:19.259
He has also done lot of research,

25:19.460 --> 25:24.829
and we found out, that with vibrations we start after Realization,

25:25.030 --> 25:29.627
if you vibrate the water and if you water the plants with that,

25:29.828 --> 25:32.819
then sometimes you might get even ten times more breed.

25:33.020 --> 25:37.300
That’s what they did in India, in one of the Agricultural University.

25:37.501 --> 25:40.519
But here also he’s found out that there’s tremendous difference

25:40.720 --> 25:43.247
between the growth of an ordinary thing.

25:43.496 --> 25:46.037
Another thing we have found out in agriculture,

25:46.238 --> 25:48.159
that if you give vibrations then

25:48.360 --> 25:52.220
even an ordinary cow can give lot of milk.

25:52.852 --> 25:55.265
But if you have hybrid cows then, you see,

25:55.466 --> 25:56.820
it’s not good for the brain,

25:57.034 --> 26:00.923
because a person who takes hybrid milk, also gets hybrid.

26:01.124 --> 26:03.296
I mean his brain becomes little wobbly.

26:03.497 --> 26:06.470
So better to have a pure milk from a cow

26:06.671 --> 26:11.321
which is not been put to this kind of a experimentation.

26:11.522 --> 26:13.857
Moreover, food also, if it’s hybrid food,

26:14.058 --> 26:17.711
it’s not very good for us because that spoils our nerves, I think.

26:17.912 --> 26:21.907
But ordinary seeds you cannot use because they have weakened

26:22.108 --> 26:23.669
and they cannot reproduce.

26:23.870 --> 26:26.408
So when we vibrate them

26:26.609 --> 26:29.157
they produce very well just like,

26:29.358 --> 26:31.719
better than even sometimes, hybrid thing,

26:31.920 --> 26:33.973
and the food, it tastes very well

26:34.174 --> 26:36.122
and it doesn’t give those complications.

26:36.323 --> 26:38.600
So this can help in agriculture in India,

26:38.801 --> 26:41.780
and the government has allotted us lot of land

26:41.981 --> 26:44.147
where we are going to now experiment,

26:44.348 --> 26:46.702
and we are going to start the experimentation there

26:46.903 --> 26:49.260
to show that how we can use this.

26:49.461 --> 26:52.950
But many farmers who are Sahaja Yogis have done a lot of job

26:53.151 --> 26:57.211
and they have discovered that even animals

26:57.412 --> 26:59.870
and this, what you call,

27:00.071 --> 27:04.412
farming, everything is helped very much by vibration.

27:04.613 --> 27:07.030
So it improves the lives of people.

27:07.231 --> 27:10.824
We have on the other side, social side, I can tell you that

27:11.660 --> 27:15.009
we have our marriages – international marriages.

27:15.210 --> 27:19.426
We arrange international marriages between people.

27:19.627 --> 27:25.345
They have to know each other and they are together.

27:25.546 --> 27:29.796
And first of all they are together for one or half month

27:29.997 --> 27:31.661
with us in the tour. They see each other

27:31.862 --> 27:33.277
and their marriages are fixed.

27:33.478 --> 27:37.363
And we have seen that such marriages are extremely successful.

27:37.564 --> 27:40.053
Ninety-nine percent marriages are successful.

27:40.254 --> 27:41.951
Once in a while, maybe a mishap,

27:42.152 --> 27:44.758
but mostly there are no divorces that take place.

27:44.959 --> 27:46.824
Once in a while if it’s not successful

27:47.025 --> 27:48.682
we have no objection to divorce also,

27:48.935 --> 27:51.261
but mostly it is successful and they get children

27:51.462 --> 27:53.462
who are very intelligent,

27:53.653 --> 27:56.328
who are themselves born realized children, mostly.

27:56.529 --> 28:00.188
So the problem is much less and the family life improves.

28:00.389 --> 28:03.280
The quality of life is thousand times better.

28:03.481 --> 28:06.555
People are very joyous, happy, they do not complain,

28:06.756 --> 28:08.853
and they enjoy life and they give to others.

28:09.054 --> 28:12.287
They share what joy they have. So …

28:12.488 --> 28:13.516
I: Can I ask a question?

28:13.717 --> 28:15.452
What do you think are the important points

28:15.653 --> 28:17.286
in the education of children,

28:17.487 --> 28:21.155
what are important to give to the children?

28:21.356 --> 28:24.060
You see, first if they get Realization,

28:24.261 --> 28:26.962
to get first time to that point of Realization...

28:27.163 --> 28:29.193
If they are already born realized no problem,

28:29.394 --> 28:31.777
but if they have, they're given Realization,

28:31.978 --> 28:34.693
then, you see, they start seeing from a different level.

28:34.894 --> 28:38.673
They become the Spirit. So their self-respect, you see, awaken.

28:39.621 --> 28:44.638
Such children behave in a very dignified, elderly manner, you see.

28:44.839 --> 28:47.262
They talk in a very elderly manner

28:47.463 --> 28:50.046
and this gives solutions of all kinds, you see.

28:50.247 --> 28:53.101
And they are tremendous people.

28:53.302 --> 28:56.978
But we have to guide them properly by our own behavior,

28:57.179 --> 29:00.317
how we behave. The greatest thing is how we behave.

29:00.518 --> 29:02.225
That’s how the children learn.

29:02.426 --> 29:06.340
We put the children certain

29:06.541 --> 29:08.890
to some tests, how they are.

29:09.091 --> 29:12.369
We find out if they have any physical problems, we cure them.

29:12.570 --> 29:14.761
If they have mental problem, we cure them.

29:14.962 --> 29:18.673
If they have any other problem, social problem or anything,

29:18.874 --> 29:20.190
we try to help them out.

29:20.391 --> 29:24.830
So that basically if a human being is all right in the childhood,

29:25.031 --> 29:27.441
then fundamentals are all right for the child.

29:27.642 --> 29:29.014
The foundation is laid down.

29:29.215 --> 29:33.404
Then to build a child up into a good quality is not difficult.

29:33.605 --> 29:37.176
So now we find great artists are there,

29:37.377 --> 29:39.398
there are great musicians

29:39.599 --> 29:42.634
and at a very young age they have started playing violin...

29:42.835 --> 29:46.295
I mean suddenly they have become dynamic also and very humble.

29:46.496 --> 29:49.804
They are very humble and self-respectfing and very well-behaved.

29:50.005 --> 29:54.241
It's surprising how the atmosphere is and how it works out.

29:54.442 --> 29:57.324
And the other day the lady asked Me about the women

29:57.525 --> 30:01.650
and I told her that a woman’s power as a mother is very great.

30:01.851 --> 30:03.718
And she felt hurt about it. But I didn’t mean

30:03.919 --> 30:05.848
that you should be just a mother. What I am saying,

30:06.049 --> 30:09.443
she is a mother, means she is compassionate, she is kind,

30:09.644 --> 30:11.389
she is not aggressive like men.

30:11.590 --> 30:13.161
That is a very big quality.

30:13.362 --> 30:16.282
That is a very big power in a woman. That is what I was suggesting

30:16.483 --> 30:18.110
that that is what we have to earn,

30:18.311 --> 30:22.291
is not to compete with men. It's madness to compete with men,

30:22.492 --> 30:25.711
and to go about like that, because...

30:25.981 --> 30:29.695
You see we have to understand that life

30:29.896 --> 30:34.897
has to be enjoyable.

30:35.495 --> 30:38.643
Life is to be a blessing, not to be a misery.

30:38.862 --> 30:42.120
We create our own miseries by these false ideas,

30:42.321 --> 30:47.588
by our own conflictions we have in our mind,

30:47.789 --> 30:49.902
mental projections we have in our mind,

30:50.093 --> 30:52.882
or our own obstinacy – whatever it is.

30:53.083 --> 30:55.362
All these things can be cured

30:55.575 --> 30:57.037
if you take to Sahaja Yoga

30:57.238 --> 31:00.588
because you become a balanced person, level-headed, wise person.

31:00.789 --> 31:01.834
And you become a witness.

31:02.035 --> 31:04.455
The whole thing becomes like a show, like a drama.

31:04.656 --> 31:05.696
And you become fearless,

31:05.897 --> 31:07.836
you start seeing the whole thing like a drama.

31:08.037 --> 31:10.328
And this is what a human being has to achieve.

31:10.529 --> 31:13.923
We talk of peace. We talk of no war.

31:14.124 --> 31:16.107
We talk of many things like this, you see,

31:16.308 --> 31:19.593
atomic bomb, this, that... All that is not going to work out.

31:19.807 --> 31:21.084
Only what is going to work out

31:21.285 --> 31:23.184
is the transformation of human beings.

31:23.385 --> 31:25.141
If the human beings are transformed,

31:25.342 --> 31:27.757
things will work out absolutely first class.

31:27.958 --> 31:33.739
Not only that, but that they will enjoy the bliss of life.

31:33.940 --> 31:36.589
We are missing the point altogether!

31:36.790 --> 31:39.570
This is a very important thing

31:39.771 --> 31:41.689
that human beings must say, one thing:

31:41.890 --> 31:44.419
what have we achieved out of all these?

31:44.620 --> 31:46.971
Just for a minute to stop and think.

31:49.237 --> 31:51.546
What would you say is the definition of illness?

31:51.682 --> 31:54.132
What's the causes of illness?

31:54.979 --> 31:58.866
It’s the physical, mental, emotional, all illnesses are caused

31:59.067 --> 32:02.874
by the imbalances within us, by our extreme behavior.

32:03.075 --> 32:06.873
And supposing say now the cancer. We can take the cancer.

32:07.074 --> 32:10.304
Cancer is caused by the over-activity

32:10.505 --> 32:12.827
of the sympathetic nervous system.

32:13.028 --> 32:18.595
Now supposing a person is a very sad person.

32:18.796 --> 32:22.216
He cries and weeps and all the time feels guilty

32:22.417 --> 32:25.032
and thinks that he is the worst person ever born,

32:25.233 --> 32:28.657
he’s committed so many sins and all sorts of nonsense, you see.

32:28.897 --> 32:31.341
Then he goes to the left side, according to us

32:31.542 --> 32:34.289
and crosses over to the collective subconscious area.

32:34.490 --> 32:38.082
And there, according to us, what they call as Protein 58,

32:38.283 --> 32:41.004
and Protein 52, doctors call it that way,

32:41.205 --> 32:43.277
but we call it as the dead souls;

32:43.478 --> 32:45.825
they exist there and they catch hold of you

32:46.026 --> 32:48.206
and they trigger the cancer.

32:48.407 --> 32:49.840
But supposing by any chance

32:50.041 --> 32:53.504
you can bring the attention fully away from that

32:53.705 --> 32:55.860
in the center you can get cured.

32:56.061 --> 32:59.791
So it is the centers within us which are subtle,

33:00.026 --> 33:02.317
which are basically seven centers.

33:02.518 --> 33:04.500
There are many others, but basically seven.

33:04.677 --> 33:06.053
If you can put them right,

33:06.254 --> 33:10.257
you cannot have any sickness or illness, of any kind.

33:11.758 --> 33:15.095
Let's go back to your childhood.

33:15.365 --> 33:20.015
Can You explain - Your parents

33:20.216 --> 33:23.649
supported You very much in Your learning and in Your studies.

33:23.850 --> 33:26.070
It’s correct? [unclear]

33:26.365 --> 33:29.567
Yes, yes. Of course. You see in...

33:29.768 --> 33:31.377
Is this normal

33:31.514 --> 33:34.339
that parents support the child like You in Your family?

33:34.540 --> 33:37.485
In India, all parents support the child.

33:37.686 --> 33:40.120
- Even if...
- You can learn everything what You want to?

33:40.337 --> 33:41.972
Yes, yes, I mean, that is true.

33:42.210 --> 33:44.013
But you see the basic thing is

33:44.214 --> 33:47.702
parents are very benevolent to children, very kind to children,

33:47.903 --> 33:52.851
and to them, you see, the child’s education, child’s upbringing

33:53.052 --> 33:55.965
and child’s life is very important.

33:56.166 --> 34:00.047
That’s why we know they are, so we depend on them,

34:00.248 --> 34:03.534
they look after us and they are very wise people.

34:03.735 --> 34:05.678
They sacrifice everything for us.

34:05.879 --> 34:09.096
So, whatever they say we think it’s nice

34:09.312 --> 34:12.317
and by doing this we have not lost anything so far.

34:12.533 --> 34:14.761
In India if you find Indian children when they come abroad

34:14.962 --> 34:16.862
they always talk the least anywhere.

34:17.063 --> 34:19.112
They are very obedient children

34:19.313 --> 34:21.612
and they behave very well.

34:21.813 --> 34:24.656
We don’t have all this problem, teenage problem, homosexual.

34:24.857 --> 34:26.731
We don’t know even all this problems are

34:26.932 --> 34:29.341
because we are so close with the parents all the time.

34:29.542 --> 34:31.874
They all the time watch us. We don’t have drug problem,

34:32.075 --> 34:34.855
none of these. Only in the cities, little bit,

34:35.056 --> 34:36.597
it happens and it disappears;

34:36.798 --> 34:39.007
because parents are all the time with their children.

34:39.208 --> 34:41.564
We live together. The whole family lives together.

34:41.765 --> 34:43.420
And not only with the parents

34:43.621 --> 34:46.405
but all the relations and all the people

34:46.606 --> 34:49.521
in the village and the city, everyone knows each other.

34:49.722 --> 34:52.225
Such a joint system we have

34:52.392 --> 34:56.526
that we do not normally,

34:56.727 --> 34:59.742
sort of, go into wrong ways and methods

34:59.943 --> 35:02.458
and we do not become obstinate also.

35:03.133 --> 35:05.549
- But, You grew up in a Christian family in India.
- Yes.

35:05.750 --> 35:06.822
Yes.

35:07.017 --> 35:11.320
It’s not a normal situation, that Indian people are Christian.

35:11.521 --> 35:13.125
Yes, I know. It is, you see,

35:13.326 --> 35:15.667
I was born in a Christian family deliberately,

35:15.850 --> 35:19.714
because I think, you see, I personally think,

35:19.915 --> 35:22.753
that Protestants are the greatest fanatics;

35:22.954 --> 35:24.936
because they are very sophisticated, you see,

35:25.137 --> 35:26.555
their fanaticism is in their brain.

35:26.756 --> 35:28.682
Nobody can make them out of their fanaticism.

35:28.883 --> 35:31.441
They are very great fanatics, the greatest of all.

35:31.642 --> 35:33.738
But My parents were very enlightened people

35:33.939 --> 35:35.971
and they understood Christ very well.

35:36.172 --> 35:38.777
Yesterday I told you about Paul, you see, when I was -

35:38.978 --> 35:40.917
first time I took the Bible in the hand

35:41.118 --> 35:42.853
and I asked My father, “Who is this Paul?”.

35:43.054 --> 35:46.270
He said “He is an intruder. Forget him. Don’t read him at all.”

35:46.471 --> 35:48.862
So you see they understood all these things very well

35:49.063 --> 35:51.165
and because My father was a realized soul,

35:51.366 --> 35:53.577
like Khalil Gibran, you see. If you read Khalil Gibran,

35:53.778 --> 35:55.860
he says the same thing about Paul, the same thing.

35:56.061 --> 35:59.156
So, you see, if you are an enlightened person,

35:59.357 --> 36:01.138
you see the essence of everything.

36:01.339 --> 36:03.088
Whatever religion you may be born,

36:03.263 --> 36:06.143
you don’t ignore any other religion.

36:06.344 --> 36:08.356
You try to learn about other religion,

36:08.557 --> 36:11.088
and you find the essence is the same in every religion.

36:11.363 --> 36:12.499
What is there to fight?

36:12.700 --> 36:14.373
And that’s how you belong to no religion,

36:14.574 --> 36:17.415
you belong to every religion. That’s what happens.

36:17.616 --> 36:20.584
But My parents were very enlightened people, I must say,

36:20.785 --> 36:24.531
and I was very lucky to choose them as My parents.

36:25.584 --> 36:28.078
You have been an enlightened child, is it correct?

36:28.279 --> 36:30.775
- I beg your pardon?
- You had been an enlightened child?

36:30.976 --> 36:32.838
Yes, I have been born as an enlightened child.

36:33.039 --> 36:35.990
But You don’t feel sometimes very lonesome,

36:36.191 --> 36:40.791
because all the others are different?

36:41.200 --> 36:44.830
No, no, that is, you see, if you know how to share with others...

36:45.031 --> 36:48.846
Actually I was like a Mother to them from My very childhood.

36:49.047 --> 36:51.329
When My father, mother went to jail I was,

36:51.530 --> 36:54.414
first time, I was about, I think five and a half years of age.

36:54.615 --> 36:59.252
So I had all the keys of the house in My little frock thing,

36:59.453 --> 37:02.534
and I used to carry all the duties like a grandmother.

37:02.735 --> 37:04.565
I never felt lost. I mean,

37:04.766 --> 37:07.314
My life is on the whole is very collective,

37:07.515 --> 37:09.978
by temperament I am extremely collective.

37:10.179 --> 37:12.595
I can live anywhere. I can sleep anywhere.

37:12.796 --> 37:14.685
I can live in the jungles. I can...

37:14.886 --> 37:18.500
I have no problems of that. I am extremely collective.

37:18.701 --> 37:22.199
I am not exclusive by temperament, from very childhood.

37:22.400 --> 37:24.973
I was very friendly with all the people

37:25.174 --> 37:27.305
in that area where we were living

37:27.506 --> 37:29.772
and My mother was known as Nirmala’s mother,

37:29.973 --> 37:31.551
father was known as Nirmala’s father.

37:31.752 --> 37:34.463
So they said, “We have lost our identity because of Her”.

37:34.664 --> 37:38.196
So I was a very friendly person. I never felt lonely,

37:38.397 --> 37:40.963
and when I am with Myself I am never lonely at all.

37:41.164 --> 37:43.801
I enjoy Myself very much.

37:46.144 --> 37:50.082
When You had been to the ashram with Gandhi,

37:50.283 --> 37:54.471
can You mention one or two impressions You remember

37:54.672 --> 37:56.826
about Gandhi?

37:57.027 --> 37:58.652
Oh! Gandhiji was a tremendous man.

37:58.853 --> 38:00.915
One has to learn a lot from him.

38:01.116 --> 38:04.628
He was not at all a hypocrite, that’s one thing.

38:04.829 --> 38:09.112
And he was not like modern, we say, politicians,

38:09.313 --> 38:13.074
who says something, do something. No, he was very outspoken

38:13.275 --> 38:17.415
and always put himself on the testing point.

38:17.624 --> 38:21.608
And he used to confess if he made mistakes, immediately.

38:21.809 --> 38:26.093
One very great incident I remember, when I was a small child.

38:26.294 --> 38:29.559
They were having a meeting together

38:29.760 --> 38:33.377
and we girls were there only sitting giving them

38:33.578 --> 38:35.431
water and things, to all the people.

38:35.632 --> 38:39.000
All the big people were there, like...

38:39.209 --> 38:42.392
Jawaharlal Lal Nehru was there and also Maulana Azad,

38:42.593 --> 38:44.454
all these people were sitting there.

38:44.655 --> 38:47.627
They were discussing something and then suddenly

38:47.828 --> 38:51.790
Mahatmaji said that, “Now it’s very late. We’ll have lunch here.”

38:52.460 --> 38:55.352
So they said, “Yes, yes, we’ll have lunch here.”

38:55.553 --> 38:58.210
They had to go to the guest house which was far away.

38:58.411 --> 39:03.707
So Mahatmaji asked for the Baa, is his wife. She had gone out.

39:03.908 --> 39:05.989
So he got up. He had a key with him,

39:06.190 --> 39:07.908
you see, always of the store room.

39:08.075 --> 39:09.312
He opened the store room,

39:09.513 --> 39:13.013
and he asked the people who were in charge of cooking

39:13.214 --> 39:14.871
to measure everything

39:15.072 --> 39:18.901
according to the people there are, properly, everything, you see.

39:19.102 --> 39:22.611
And then he, and they measured it out, everything was done

39:22.812 --> 39:24.051
then he put the key back,

39:24.252 --> 39:26.557
and then he went and sat there nicely.

39:26.774 --> 39:28.461
So these people said,

39:28.662 --> 39:31.950
“Bapu, we did not know you had to take so much trouble,

39:32.151 --> 39:36.260
you see, to go all the way and measure out everything out for us.”

39:36.461 --> 39:39.220
It did not take much time, about fifteen minutes, but still.

39:39.421 --> 39:41.574
So he said, “What do you think?

39:41.775 --> 39:46.099
This is the blood of my country. I cannot allow it to be wasted”.

39:46.300 --> 39:49.160
See, that’s the sign of a person who understands

39:49.361 --> 39:53.307
the value of public money. That’s just ingrained in him,

39:53.508 --> 39:57.053
but those who saw him also felt

39:57.285 --> 40:01.186
that, "Look at this man, who is living like an ascetic, absolutely,

40:01.387 --> 40:04.422
in the sense that he would not touch the public money".

40:04.623 --> 40:08.136
And that is one of the key, keys for all the leaders.

40:08.337 --> 40:11.975
If they are absolutely above the money,

40:12.176 --> 40:16.438
then only people will respect; otherwise, there is no way out.

40:16.639 --> 40:18.528
But you find these days in every country

40:18.729 --> 40:21.586
so much of corruption, hypocrisy,

40:21.777 --> 40:23.797
then you are really shocked.

40:23.998 --> 40:26.049
What do You think is the reason

40:26.312 --> 40:30.557
of all these corruption, of the political instability?

40:31.214 --> 40:34.426
It’s ignorance. It is ignorance.

40:34.662 --> 40:39.673
They think by having money or by having big position

40:39.874 --> 40:44.631
or by having a big name, they’ll be happy.

40:44.832 --> 40:48.129
They will not be happy. Only the ego will be pampered.

40:48.330 --> 40:51.547
When it is slightly hurt, the person will be unhappy.

40:51.748 --> 40:54.936
So he’ll be going into from happiness to unhappiness.

40:55.137 --> 40:57.732
But when he gets the knowledge

40:57.931 --> 41:01.271
that it is the Spirit which is the source of joy,

41:01.472 --> 41:04.885
then he doesn’t care for money, he doesn’t care for all these things.

41:05.086 --> 41:07.801
He is not afraid of anything. He lives like a Lord himself.

41:08.002 --> 41:10.120
He is a Lord, he doesn’t want anything.

41:10.319 --> 41:12.879
You see, the one who is the Lord doesn’t want anything.

41:13.080 --> 41:16.060
For example, now, as you know, I come from a rich family,

41:16.261 --> 41:17.877
my husband from a rich family.

41:18.132 --> 41:21.450
He’s now well to do. We have very comfortable living,

41:21.668 --> 41:25.052
but I can live in a, on a street, I can sleep on a street,

41:25.253 --> 41:28.663
because I am like a queen. I don’t need anything.

41:28.864 --> 41:31.068
If you need anything then you are a beggar,

41:31.269 --> 41:33.290
otherwise you are a king, isn’t it?

41:33.491 --> 41:36.851
That’s what I feel. So that is what is the ignorance.

41:37.052 --> 41:41.412
Once they know we are just fighting our ignorance

41:41.613 --> 41:43.277
they’ll give it up. It’s nonsense.

41:43.478 --> 41:46.154
It is nonsense and it’s not at all joy giving.

41:46.355 --> 41:48.776
Your virtues are very joy giving.

41:48.977 --> 41:54.149
If you know about your chastity, or you know about your honesty,

41:54.350 --> 41:57.164
or if you know about your straightforwardness,

41:57.365 --> 41:58.766
it’s very joy giving.

41:58.967 --> 42:01.031
You feel so confident, so happy

42:01.232 --> 42:03.758
and such a person never tries to harm anyone,

42:03.959 --> 42:05.381
to be sarcastic with anyone.

42:05.582 --> 42:07.459
Such a person is absolutely free, I should say,

42:07.660 --> 42:09.989
because he has no bondages of any kind.

42:10.190 --> 42:12.409
These are all bondages which bind us

42:12.610 --> 42:15.480
and we become jealous and we become greedy,

42:15.681 --> 42:18.550
we become lusty. All this is nonsense.

42:19.285 --> 42:21.972
It’s to be just seen after getting to your Spirit

42:22.173 --> 42:24.741
that the light shows these are all like snakes, you see,

42:24.942 --> 42:27.752
crawling up on us and we are holding on to snakes.

42:27.953 --> 42:31.323
People when they die, you see - big, big people I have seen -

42:31.524 --> 42:33.326
people tell about them.

42:33.501 --> 42:35.977
In the history they go down as horrible people.

42:36.278 --> 42:38.827
In the history they are described as people who were hypocrites,

42:39.028 --> 42:44.932
who were cruel, who were very, I should say, adamant type,

42:45.133 --> 42:46.793
and all kinds of things is described.

42:46.994 --> 42:50.222
Whatever is genuine remains genuine.

42:52.288 --> 42:55.439
You never, don’t feel frightened?

42:55.621 --> 43:00.361
No, I don’t. I don’t know anything like fear.

43:00.847 --> 43:04.479
What’s there to be afraid of?

43:04.680 --> 43:06.259
I am never afraid of,

43:06.460 --> 43:10.992
because if you believe and you know definitely there is God all over,

43:11.193 --> 43:12.947
there is nothing to be afraid of.

43:13.148 --> 43:16.335
He looks after you every moment, every minute.

43:16.536 --> 43:18.297
Wherever you are, He looks after you.

43:18.498 --> 43:21.096
These people have had so many experiences of that.

43:21.297 --> 43:24.790
There was one girl who was a Sahaja Yogini

43:24.991 --> 43:29.790
and she was driving somewhere in Germany on an Autobahn,

43:29.991 --> 43:31.716
and there were so many cars were with her.

43:31.917 --> 43:33.968
And suddenly her brake failed

43:34.169 --> 43:36.029
and the car started going this way, that way.

43:36.230 --> 43:38.897
She didn’t know how to manage it. She said, “Now, what to do?”

43:39.098 --> 43:41.625
She just... She had another one also with her.

43:41.826 --> 43:42.897
Both of them, they said,

43:43.098 --> 43:45.140
“All right, let us close our eyes and think of Mother.”

43:45.341 --> 43:47.560
They just started thinking of Me and said,

43:47.761 --> 43:50.190
“We’ll not be afraid, just think of Her”.

43:50.398 --> 43:52.952
And suddenly they found that their car had come

43:53.153 --> 43:58.256
to one side of the road very nicely without any scratch.

43:58.774 --> 44:04.272
So, you see, it is just our fear makes us more frantic and stupid.

44:04.473 --> 44:06.892
There is nothing to be afraid of.

44:07.093 --> 44:09.213
It is to be seen how God helps you.

44:09.414 --> 44:11.635
But people don’t want to take His help, you see.

44:11.836 --> 44:15.831
Then God says, “All right, go ahead and break your head. What to do?”

44:17.477 --> 44:20.276
Sometimes other people are helping.

44:20.477 --> 44:23.204
Yes, then you should know how to handle them.

44:23.405 --> 44:26.005
You see, they, for example, yesterday that fellow came.

44:26.206 --> 44:28.115
You see, he just became like a beaten up dog.

44:28.316 --> 44:31.489
You saw him coming and saying something to Me, which you never heard.

44:31.690 --> 44:34.793
But they belong to a cult, some sort of a cult, you see,

44:34.994 --> 44:38.722
and they always oppose us. They have some sort of Christians.

44:38.923 --> 44:43.713
And when I was in Geneva, one of the ladies,

44:43.914 --> 44:48.966
all, you see, dressed up in a very fashionable way,

44:49.167 --> 44:52.366
she came to Me with a Bible in her hand to hit me, you see.

44:52.567 --> 44:55.919
And everybody got frightened that now she is going to beat Me.

44:56.120 --> 44:59.396
This woman walked with big high heels upon Me

44:59.597 --> 45:02.398
and I dont know, they thought she’ll do something to Me.

45:02.599 --> 45:04.578
As soon as I saw her with the Bible, you know,

45:04.785 --> 45:06.425
I started laughing, absolutely.

45:06.626 --> 45:09.072
I couldn’t bear. I thought, “Such a joker she is.

45:09.273 --> 45:11.772
She is coming to hit Me with a Bible? How can she do it?”

45:11.973 --> 45:15.008
And she got worried about Me that I am laughing so much.

45:15.209 --> 45:16.421
It’s all on the tape.

45:16.622 --> 45:18.744
And these boys were very much frightened, I've seen.

45:18.945 --> 45:21.410
I was not at all. I said, “It’s perfectly all right,”

45:21.611 --> 45:23.814
and she ran away because she saw Me laughing, you know.

45:24.015 --> 45:27.295
I just couldn’t help [unclear] laughing at the joker,

45:27.496 --> 45:30.904
the way she came to hit Me with a Bible. Imagine!

45:31.105 --> 45:33.303
So this is what it is. If you are afraid

45:33.504 --> 45:36.873
then they sit on your heads. But you should not be afraid.

45:38.396 --> 45:42.978
There's a chinese story that there's one king who took two,

45:43.179 --> 45:49.454
two cocks for fighting to a very realised soul, a guru,

45:49.655 --> 45:52.383
and he said, "You make them all right".

45:52.584 --> 45:54.883
So he said "All right". He trained them for one month,

45:55.084 --> 45:56.617
and they went for a fight.

45:56.843 --> 46:00.696
So many cocks were brought him to fight these.

46:00.897 --> 46:02.699
So these two were standing there,

46:02.867 --> 46:05.325
they would no attack anyone, just standing.

46:05.526 --> 46:07.559
Everybody was attacking, they were just standing.

46:07.760 --> 46:09.359
Everybody got frightened, all the,

46:09.560 --> 46:12.072
all the cocks got frightened and ran away.

46:12.273 --> 46:15.426
And these two were standing there nicely.

46:16.966 --> 46:21.455
You should not attack anyone, nor anybody would attack you.

46:23.200 --> 46:24.935
Yes, they are there, but quite alright.

46:25.136 --> 46:26.797
But I am not frightened of them.

46:26.998 --> 46:30.827
So far nobody has been successful.

46:41.525 --> 46:47.265
P: I request Mataji, if Mataji can explain how to raise the Kundalini,

46:47.466 --> 46:50.312
that may help the guests also.

46:50.513 --> 46:54.472
Explain how to raise the Kundalini.
P: Yes

47:02.890 --> 47:07.228
He wants to know how the Kundalini is raised.

47:07.429 --> 47:11.084
As they explained the, yesterday in German language,

47:11.293 --> 47:15.117
that at the base of our spine,

47:15.318 --> 47:18.662
there is a power lying there,

47:18.863 --> 47:22.226
which is the reflection of the Holy Ghost within us.

47:22.427 --> 47:24.956
And the Spirit lies in the heart

47:25.157 --> 47:28.078
which is the reflection of God Almighty.

47:28.279 --> 47:33.578
So the power of God is the Holy Ghost, is a female power,

47:33.779 --> 47:38.715
because God is a male,

47:38.916 --> 47:43.519
then He has a son. There has to be a Mother to the son.

47:45.486 --> 47:47.862
They didn't want to have a woman there, imagine.

47:48.063 --> 47:50.689
We cannot have women for...

47:50.890 --> 47:53.185
They cannot be ordained. This is too much.

47:53.386 --> 47:55.224
It's not in India like this, you see.

47:55.375 --> 47:57.330
You don't find this kind of a nonsense there

47:57.531 --> 48:00.380
but is here that women have accepted, though you are so advanced.

48:00.596 --> 48:03.351
There, here it is so stupid that women cannot become priests.

48:03.552 --> 48:06.365
Why can't they if the men can be?

48:06.566 --> 48:10.859
So, this, to avoid the women from the whole thing,

48:11.060 --> 48:16.213
they called It a Holy Ghost, without telling that it's a female.

48:16.414 --> 48:18.825
And that female power is the Shakti

48:19.026 --> 48:22.060
which resides in the triangular bone.

48:22.284 --> 48:29.855
Now, what happens, that when a person who is authorised,

48:30.056 --> 48:33.936
in a way that a person who is a realised soul,

48:35.144 --> 48:40.697
is faced by such a person, then the Kundalini spontaneously rises.

48:40.898 --> 48:48.505
Just like in the womb of the Mother Earth if you put any seed,

48:48.706 --> 48:53.328
spontaneously it sprouts because it's a living process.

48:53.573 --> 48:56.545
And it passes through the six chakras.

48:56.746 --> 48:59.770
The seventh is the last chakra, which is the pelvic,

49:00.004 --> 49:01.472
which helps the pelvic plexus.

49:01.673 --> 49:03.924
So it doesn't play any part,

49:04.125 --> 49:07.990
means sex does not play any part in this. You become like a child.

49:08.191 --> 49:10.516
And the Kundalini passes through six centres

49:10.717 --> 49:12.767
ultimately the sixth one is here,

49:12.968 --> 49:18.152
which we call as Sahasrara, meaning thousand petaled lotus.

49:18.353 --> 49:20.589
But actually it is the limbic area,

49:20.790 --> 49:25.166
and at the apex of limbic area here, at the fontanel bone area,

49:25.367 --> 49:26.658
It pierces through,

49:26.859 --> 49:28.320
and you actually start feeling

49:28.521 --> 49:30.907
the cool breeze coming out of your head.

49:31.108 --> 49:33.002
Actually start feeling like that.

49:33.203 --> 49:36.274
So, it just sprouts by itself,

49:36.425 --> 49:39.247
it is a spontaneous happening.

49:43.115 --> 49:45.676
Did you understand?

49:45.877 --> 49:49.093
You are from the country of Krishna, You should know many things.

49:49.294 --> 49:52.242
After coming here, you people have forgotten God.

49:53.079 --> 49:54.261
Is it true or not?
