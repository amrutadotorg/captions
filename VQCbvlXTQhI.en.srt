1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:08,273
Now, we are starting a New Year,

2
00:00:08,474 --> 00:00:16,136
and I wish you all a very happy and
prosperous New Year.

3
00:00:23,696 --> 00:00:36,183
In this wish of Mine I also wish you a very
deep growth in Sahaja Yoga.

4
00:00:44,118 --> 00:00:54,589
Now you all are Sahaja Yogis and you all
have to become masters in Sahaja Yoga.

5
00:00:54,805 --> 00:01:06,434
For becoming masters in Sahaja Yoga I am
sure you are doing meditation, introspection

6
00:01:07,798 --> 00:01:14,156
and all kinds of Sahaja Yoga rituals,
I should say.

7
00:01:18,898 --> 00:01:29,260
In this New Year, I’ll think there is
greater chance

8
00:01:31,025 --> 00:01:35,197
for you to do much better,

9
00:01:35,915 --> 00:01:43,704
because all those years of ordeals are
over.

10
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:58,573
We are now entering into the New Era. I say
now the Satya Yuga is established.

11
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:10,614
In the beginning you may not feel
the atmosphere

12
00:02:11,354 --> 00:02:16,755
of Kali Yuga being cleared out completely.

13
00:02:16,956 --> 00:02:23,909
Of course, gradually you’ll find that’s all
clearing out

14
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:31,895
and all the people who are dangerous
for your spiritual life,

15
00:02:32,096 --> 00:02:42,543
for your national life, for your family
life, will have to take back their way;

16
00:02:42,744 --> 00:02:46,301
they cannot be successful here.

17
00:02:53,909 --> 00:03:01,270
Now the Sahaja Yogis have to decide how far
they will spread Sahaja Yoga all over.

18
00:03:01,471 --> 00:03:05,722
How many people can get into Sahaja Yoga?

19
00:03:05,923 --> 00:03:12,442
There should be many more waiting for you
this year,

20
00:03:12,643 --> 00:03:19,442
and maybe this year, if you all decide to
work it out, I am sure

21
00:03:19,643 --> 00:03:27,808
you can get lots of people who will be
saved from the curses of Kali Yuga.

22
00:03:28,009 --> 00:03:35,934
This is going to be your vow on the New
Year day,

23
00:03:36,137 --> 00:03:43,286
that now we are going to start Sahaja Yoga
in a new way,

24
00:03:43,487 --> 00:03:47,659
in a bigger way, in a more dynamic way.

25
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:55,763
For that, first thing is needed is your
Sangha Shakti, that is your collectivity.

26
00:03:55,964 --> 00:04:03,083
This collectivity has to be extremely well
built-in, well made,

27
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:08,815
well understood and absolutely loveable.

28
00:04:09,784 --> 00:04:16,395
This is not difficult in Sahaja Yoga,
because practically all your jealousies,

29
00:04:16,596 --> 00:04:26,127
all your baser ideas have been completely
washed out by your Kundalini.

30
00:04:26,328 --> 00:04:33,067
She has transformed you, you are different
people; you are very, very different.

31
00:04:33,268 --> 00:04:41,855
Not only that, but you have now understood
yourselves.

32
00:04:42,056 --> 00:04:47,895
You are knowing your Self. And all those
who know their self

33
00:04:48,096 --> 00:04:51,584
cannot fight with each other.

34
00:04:52,745 --> 00:05:00,745
Because this Self is the reflection of one
person,

35
00:05:00,946 --> 00:05:08,980
of one Deity, of one God. And so how can
you fight?

36
00:05:09,181 --> 00:05:16,745
When He is within your heart, how can you
fight with each other?

37
00:05:16,946 --> 00:05:20,723
When He, otherwise you’ll be fighting
with yourself.

38
00:05:20,924 --> 00:05:25,317
It would be very, very stupid to do that.

39
00:05:25,518 --> 00:05:33,776
So all the fights and all the funny things
that you have been thinking about

40
00:05:34,276 --> 00:05:39,862
will of course disappear, no doubt. But
you’ll become very dynamic.

41
00:05:40,063 --> 00:05:44,300
You’ll be amazed at your dynamism. Just you
have to rise;

42
00:05:44,501 --> 00:05:50,370
just you have to expect your Self
to manifest.

43
00:05:50,571 --> 00:05:57,169
You can become very, very collective,
progressive

44
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:01,799
and you can create many Sahaja Yogis.

45
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:10,661
You have been given Realization; you have
been given the knowledge of Realization;

46
00:06:10,862 --> 00:06:18,606
whatever was possible has been done
for your health and prosperity,

47
00:06:18,807 --> 00:06:28,198
but now it’s your duty to repay to
the Divine by your creative methods.

48
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:31,784
You have to be very creative.

49
00:06:31,985 --> 00:06:40,051
You'll find so many people in this world
are full of lots of problems,

50
00:06:40,252 --> 00:06:46,683
which you have got out of it. But you can
help them.

51
00:06:46,884 --> 00:06:51,682
You don’t need any help because you are
yourself full of power –

52
00:06:51,883 --> 00:06:58,810
power of Divinity within you. This Divine
power should be used.

53
00:06:59,011 --> 00:07:04,724
It’s not given just to be rusted. This
power has to be used.

54
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:08,975
Otherwise what’s the use of becoming
powerful?

55
00:07:09,176 --> 00:07:14,007
Supposing we have electrical power here,
and it doesn’t even give light,

56
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:17,827
so what’s the use of having electrical
power?

57
00:07:18,028 --> 00:07:23,920
So the power that you have is for
the emancipation of human beings.

58
00:07:26,377 --> 00:07:34,124
It is for you to raise the Kundalini
of people – you can do it.

59
00:07:34,325 --> 00:07:37,311
One person can do it for thousands!

60
00:07:37,512 --> 00:07:43,812
And I hope now you take up this
responsibility upon yourself.

61
00:07:44,013 --> 00:07:49,868
This would be the greatest blessing for
you, for Sahaja Yoga

62
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:57,821
and for the whole world. Because in My
vision, we have to change the whole world.

63
00:07:58,022 --> 00:08:01,766
I don’t know in My lifetime if I can
achieve it or not.

64
00:08:01,967 --> 00:08:05,554
But if you people really join hands with Me,

65
00:08:05,755 --> 00:08:11,368
with full effort, it will work out.

66
00:08:11,569 --> 00:08:20,860
Firstly I hear many people don’t go
to meditation, into collective meditation.

67
00:08:21,061 --> 00:08:28,790
They do not join together. It’s surprising
after so many years of work I’ve done –

68
00:08:28,991 --> 00:08:34,548
thirty years I’ve been working, and there
are some, some people

69
00:08:34,749 --> 00:08:41,507
who take Sahaja Yoga for granted. You don’t
understand your responsibility.

70
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:45,985
You have to meditate collectively.

71
00:08:46,186 --> 00:08:51,108
Whenever there is collective meditation
you must join that.

72
00:08:51,309 --> 00:08:59,522
You can also start something in your areas,
a collective meditation.

73
00:08:59,723 --> 00:09:05,772
And it will work out. Many people who are
in Sahaja Yoga

74
00:09:05,973 --> 00:09:09,608
are now meditating, I can make them out.

75
00:09:09,809 --> 00:09:14,007
I know who are the ones who are meditating
and who are not.

76
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:17,868
It’s not difficult to make it out. And then
you come out

77
00:09:18,069 --> 00:09:23,423
with other problems like my mother’s,
father’s, uncle’s – this thing.

78
00:09:23,624 --> 00:09:29,610
There’s no need to worry about that. Even
if you are a realized soul,

79
00:09:29,811 --> 00:09:36,827
and when you are connected with the Divine,
even your own wish will be fulfilled.

80
00:09:37,028 --> 00:09:45,110
But it does not. Why? Because you still do
not understand what you have become.

81
00:09:45,311 --> 00:09:51,655
You first try giving Realizations to others.
See what joy you feel.

82
00:09:51,856 --> 00:09:57,126
Tremendous joy. This joy you cannot get
in anything else.

83
00:09:57,327 --> 00:10:02,014
Whatever you may buy, whatever you may
have,

84
00:10:02,215 --> 00:10:06,594
you cannot get this joy of giving
Realization.

85
00:10:06,795 --> 00:10:12,266
And you will be so very happy; not because
you expect anything,

86
00:10:12,467 --> 00:10:19,071
you want anything, nothing of the kind –
but only thing is pure joy –

87
00:10:19,272 --> 00:10:26,843
pure joy of creating great Sahaja Yogis.
This is what you are there.

88
00:10:27,044 --> 00:10:36,048
This is what the Divine wants you to do.
Not just to take advantage of Divine power:

89
00:10:36,249 --> 00:10:41,110
“Cure my father, cure my mother, cure
my sister… ”

90
00:10:41,311 --> 00:10:45,641
or else, “I haven’t got properties…” Then
somebody says,

91
00:10:45,842 --> 00:10:52,391
“My husband ill-treats me…” or some wife
says that… so the husband says this...

92
00:10:52,592 --> 00:10:55,812
It’s going on and on and on. Forget it!

93
00:10:56,013 --> 00:10:59,758
You are now above everything, above all
these things.

94
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:05,188
And you have become absolutely powerful,
believe Me.

95
00:11:05,389 --> 00:11:10,796
If you haven’t used your power, then how
will you know what powers you have got?

96
00:11:10,997 --> 00:11:15,673
It’s as simple as that. Those who have
used it

97
00:11:15,874 --> 00:11:20,790
go on telling Me what miracles they had,
what things have happened to them,

98
00:11:20,991 --> 00:11:26,858
how they were protected, whatever they
wanted – how they got it.

99
00:11:27,249 --> 00:11:33,954
But see, in Sahaja Yoga you cannot be
hypocritical. If you have hypocrisy,

100
00:11:34,155 --> 00:11:37,343
Sahaja Yoga knows, the Divine knows
you are a hypocritical.

101
00:11:37,544 --> 00:11:42,735
It is for your good, for your growth you
have to be in Sahaja Yoga.

102
00:11:42,936 --> 00:11:47,110
It’s not for somebody else that you are
doing it, but for yourself.

103
00:11:47,311 --> 00:11:54,587
When people are that powerful I am
amazed, how they easily they can get cured.

104
00:11:54,788 --> 00:11:59,640
But they must meditate, and they must join
collective meditation.

105
00:11:59,841 --> 00:12:04,319
Most of the people don’t join collective
meditation. I am surprised.

106
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:09,708
I know, sometimes, say in Delhi, there is
no sufficient space,

107
00:12:09,909 --> 00:12:14,756
so people have to come twice, either
Saturday or Sunday;

108
00:12:14,957 --> 00:12:18,158
some of them have to wait outside –
doesn’t matter.

109
00:12:19,176 --> 00:12:22,522
But going for the collective meditation,

110
00:12:22,723 --> 00:12:28,920
you’ll be amazed that Divinity is flowing
there. Vibrations are flowing there.

111
00:12:29,121 --> 00:12:36,489
I am there. It’s not that you are just
going there just as a ritual.

112
00:12:36,723 --> 00:12:44,684
Problem is you people don’t realize that you
have to be responsible for Sahaja Yoga,

113
00:12:44,885 --> 00:12:51,897
responsible for giving Realizations
to others and attend

114
00:12:52,098 --> 00:12:59,247
all the programs you have of meditation.

115
00:12:59,448 --> 00:13:03,788
With collective meditation you get
all right.

116
00:13:03,989 --> 00:13:10,362
All your problems are solved if you go to
the collective meditation regularly –

117
00:13:10,563 --> 00:13:16,999
I promise you! But the problem is you won’t
go; you will write letters to Me,

118
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:22,333
you want to meet Me. This is not going
to help.

119
00:13:22,534 --> 00:13:27,577
You may come and trouble Me like that, or
do something like that, but doesn’t help.

120
00:13:27,778 --> 00:13:37,520
What helps that you help yourself. Next
year is going to be a great year for you.

121
00:13:38,575 --> 00:13:44,582
In the West now I was surprised how things
are spreading fast.

122
00:13:44,864 --> 00:13:54,208
In Russia the people are so deep – so deep.

123
00:13:54,409 --> 00:14:01,552
Once they get Realization, they understand
the value of Realization.

124
00:14:01,753 --> 00:14:07,334
They are so humble, and so deep, they don’t
want anything.

125
00:14:07,535 --> 00:14:12,881
They’ve never desired for anything. Though
they have gone through horrible

126
00:14:13,082 --> 00:14:20,130
problems of communism, and now this
reaction to that.

127
00:14:20,331 --> 00:14:29,217
Despite that, all these five countries
which I call as ‘real’

128
00:14:29,418 --> 00:14:36,504
Divine countries, because the way they have
accepted it.

129
00:14:37,114 --> 00:14:40,856
They are poor according to the modern
standards,

130
00:14:41,057 --> 00:14:45,832
but from their heart they are very,
very rich.

131
00:14:46,106 --> 00:14:52,348
From their understanding of Sahaja Yoga,
they are very, very rich.

132
00:14:52,549 --> 00:14:58,880
And their scientists are so well qualified.
In every type of thing now,

133
00:14:59,081 --> 00:15:06,334
there is one scientist who has come
to India and who has discovered a method

134
00:15:06,535 --> 00:15:11,678
by which you can see all the chakras, and
the Kundalini

135
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:17,764
and the obstructions and everything –
something he can show you.

136
00:15:17,965 --> 00:15:25,780
While our scientists are busy opposing Me.
Little knowledge is very dangerous.

137
00:15:25,981 --> 00:15:29,708
They don’t want to see what I am doing and
how I am doing it.

138
00:15:29,909 --> 00:15:36,006
They just want to criticize Me – all
so-called intellectuals.

139
00:15:36,207 --> 00:15:38,380
Especially in Maharashtra,

140
00:15:38,581 --> 00:15:42,842
the intellectuals – I think they are
something has gone wrong with their heads.

141
00:15:43,043 --> 00:15:48,663
They cannot understand Sahaja Yoga. Just
beyond them.

142
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:55,061
What has happened to them I don’t know,
but they just can’t understand Sahaja Yoga.

143
00:15:55,262 --> 00:16:00,663
And these Maharashtrians are so busy with
their rituals.

144
00:16:00,864 --> 00:16:04,669
Four o’clock in the morning they’ll get up,
take their baths, do this,

145
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:09,788
then start doing their Pujas, this, that.

146
00:16:09,989 --> 00:16:14,427
Now somebody got sick, so his wife writes
to Me,

147
00:16:14,628 --> 00:16:17,989
“We didn’t go to any temple, we didn’t do
any rituals,

148
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:21,224
still my husband has got sick.” Imagine.

149
00:16:21,425 --> 00:16:25,975
As if doing by that you mean you are
a Sahaja Yogi.

150
00:16:26,176 --> 00:16:30,506
If you are a real Sahaja Yogi, then nothing
can happen to you.

151
00:16:30,707 --> 00:16:34,600
But you have been just under wrong
impression.

152
00:16:34,801 --> 00:16:40,031
Whether you go to temple, or whether you go
to wrong places

153
00:16:40,232 --> 00:16:47,375
and do all kinds of rituals – it has never
helped anyone.

154
00:16:47,576 --> 00:16:53,984
So first you have to empty yourself. If you
are already filled with these ideas,

155
00:16:54,185 --> 00:16:59,521
these age old ideas, and you are still
carrying on with them,

156
00:16:59,722 --> 00:17:01,906
how can the Divine be filled?

157
00:17:02,107 --> 00:17:08,375
If there’s a pot already full of water or
anything – you cannot fill it.

158
00:17:08,576 --> 00:17:16,326
So you have to empty it completely. Empty
yourself, empty your mind.

159
00:17:16,527 --> 00:17:24,914
It’s possible through Sahaja Yoga if you can
take your Kundalini beyond Agnya chakra.

160
00:17:25,115 --> 00:17:30,500
By not reacting! Reaction is the worst
thing,

161
00:17:30,701 --> 00:17:36,523
because reaction comes through your Agnya,
as I told you the other day,

162
00:17:36,724 --> 00:17:45,318
and it is due to your conditioning or due
to your ego.

163
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:50,375
So some people react because of their
conditioning,

164
00:17:50,576 --> 00:17:59,703
and some people react because of their ego.
So why should you react to anything?

165
00:17:59,904 --> 00:18:04,609
Why don’t you enjoy – by not reacting.
You just watch.

166
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:11,843
See how beautifully they have made
beautiful flowers – just enjoy it.

167
00:18:12,044 --> 00:18:16,304
What is the need – some will find some
faults, somebody will say

168
00:18:16,505 --> 00:18:19,443
this should not have been there, how did
they manage this,

169
00:18:19,644 --> 00:18:27,046
all kinds of nonsensical things. The joy
of its creation is there.

170
00:18:27,247 --> 00:18:32,632
And you should be able to see it, feel it,
enjoy it.

171
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:37,911
Then you are a Sahaja Yogi. Otherwise
you are not.

172
00:18:38,112 --> 00:18:44,006
If you are a reacting type, you cannot be
a Sahaja Yogi.

173
00:18:44,207 --> 00:18:48,514
This is a degree – Sahaja Yoga is –

174
00:18:48,715 --> 00:18:54,802
I think there are so many various styles
of Sahaja Yogis.

175
00:18:55,130 --> 00:19:02,117
Somebody is just minor, somebody a little
plus, somebody’s like that.

176
00:19:02,318 --> 00:19:08,029
But the depth of the Sahaja Yogi is

177
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:13,914
to be measured by the way he keeps joyous
and happy.

178
00:19:14,115 --> 00:19:19,117
Goes on criticizing others, go on getting
angry with others,

179
00:19:19,318 --> 00:19:24,169
all these things are going on, and he
thinks he’s a Sahaja Yogi.

180
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:31,960
In our Divine University we have no
degrees, we don’t give you certificates,

181
00:19:32,162 --> 00:19:35,085
you are a Sahaja Yogi, if you have got
your Realization.

182
00:19:35,286 --> 00:19:41,052
If the Kundalini has burst opened here –
it’s all right, you are a Sahaja Yogi.

183
00:19:41,253 --> 00:19:47,785
But that Sahaja Yogi may not be a real
Sahaja Yogi.

184
00:19:47,986 --> 00:19:54,583
It only depends when you are joyous and you
are anxious

185
00:19:54,784 --> 00:20:00,412
to give Realizations to others. You want
to share your Realization,

186
00:20:00,613 --> 00:20:07,083
you just don’t want to keep it to yourself.
If that is not your condition,

187
00:20:07,284 --> 00:20:11,269
then you are still not a full Sahaja Yogi.

188
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:15,495
You should find out how many people you
have given Realization.

189
00:20:15,696 --> 00:20:21,724
It’s very important. Because next year, as
I’ve said, is a very important,

190
00:20:21,925 --> 00:20:27,254
very, very important year.

191
00:20:27,455 --> 00:20:37,748
In that year I would like to see all of you
going round and giving Realization.

192
00:20:37,949 --> 00:20:44,945
While I’ve seen all these other false gurus
who are getting exposed one by one.

193
00:20:45,805 --> 00:20:53,857
If you see their attitude, anywhere you
meet them – once I was travelling

194
00:20:54,058 --> 00:20:58,292
by plane and there was a lady sitting next
to Me, she was so hot.

195
00:20:58,493 --> 00:21:02,669
So I asked her, “What guru do you follow?”
So she told Me the name.

196
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:07,449
She said “He’s very good, this guru is
the best” … this and that.

197
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:12,013
Such heat coming from her body! I never
said anything,

198
00:21:12,214 --> 00:21:18,857
but I was amazed how this lady was proudly
talking about her guru

199
00:21:19,058 --> 00:21:26,865
who is such a bad man – and without knowing
Me, I was just a stranger to her.

200
00:21:27,066 --> 00:21:31,058
But Sahaja Yogis don’t talk about it.

201
00:21:31,259 --> 00:21:37,292
You should talk to your neighbors, you
should talk in your circle.

202
00:21:39,737 --> 00:21:46,716
Like, we have in India so many customs when
we meet people:

203
00:21:46,917 --> 00:21:50,902
Like in India we do haldi kumkum
in Maharashtra.

204
00:21:51,103 --> 00:21:55,903
They will never talk to those women who
come for haldi kumkum about Sahaja Yoga.

205
00:21:56,104 --> 00:21:59,800
They won’t even have My photograph.

206
00:22:00,362 --> 00:22:03,183
If they want, they can do it. But they
are -

207
00:22:03,384 --> 00:22:08,059
I don’t know what are they frightened
about. It’s a very good chance.

208
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:14,341
You have any dinner, you have any public
meeting, anything.

209
00:22:14,542 --> 00:22:18,644
They won’t talk about Sahaja Yoga.
It’s very surprising.

210
00:22:18,845 --> 00:22:20,784
They don’t want to talk about Sahaja Yoga

211
00:22:20,985 --> 00:22:25,239
that, “We have got this through Sahaja
Yoga.”

212
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,966
So how will Sahaja Yoga spread?

213
00:22:29,167 --> 00:22:36,380
One has to understand you all should find
out how much responsible you have been

214
00:22:36,581 --> 00:22:41,552
for getting into Sahaja Yoga. Of course,
you are all protected,

215
00:22:41,753 --> 00:22:51,309
you are all blessed, everyone has got
whatever they wanted. Most of them.

216
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:57,855
But how many of them are returning
this debt?

217
00:22:58,056 --> 00:23:03,559
How many are working to give Realization
to others?

218
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:13,216
This is a debt on you. But if your
attention is haphazard,

219
00:23:13,417 --> 00:23:22,081
if your attention is not clear, is not
nirmal,

220
00:23:22,282 --> 00:23:32,536
then you are involved into all kinds
of things like the tentacles of an octopus.

221
00:23:32,737 --> 00:23:35,269
You become like an octopus,

222
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:40,333
you go on getting attached to this,
attached to that, attached to that.

223
00:23:40,534 --> 00:23:48,784
You have to be a free bird. All these
attachments that you have

224
00:23:50,104 --> 00:23:57,474
are going to take you nowhere. You should
be only attached to Sahaja Yoga

225
00:23:57,675 --> 00:24:03,222
and should be conscious that you have known
yourself.

226
00:24:03,423 --> 00:24:10,169
If you can just understand your value,
your level,

227
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:15,534
I can tell you – we can change the whole
world!

228
00:24:15,735 --> 00:24:19,306
We have such a good heritage in this
country;

229
00:24:19,498 --> 00:24:23,214
we have such good culture in this country.

230
00:24:23,415 --> 00:24:29,393
I have seen the problems of America and
other places, we don’t have these problems.

231
00:24:29,594 --> 00:24:34,571
At least they’re not so prevalent.

232
00:24:34,772 --> 00:24:39,689
But only the thing that we have to do

233
00:24:40,344 --> 00:24:44,284
is to know you are a Sahaja Yogi.

234
00:24:44,485 --> 00:24:50,065
Like a tree – when it grows, it knows
it’s a tree.

235
00:24:50,266 --> 00:24:56,276
It knows it has to produce roots, it has
not come up ‘like that’.

236
00:24:56,477 --> 00:25:03,089
It has not been brought up just like
a stick, no.

237
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:10,565
It has to do something. In this world
everything has to do something.

238
00:25:10,766 --> 00:25:15,259
But then what about Sahaja Yogis? It’s such
a rare thing to happen

239
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:20,768
that you have got your Realization. So
where should we waste our attention?

240
00:25:20,969 --> 00:25:28,034
Why should we neglect our meditation? Why?
We have to grow, we are a different people.

241
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:34,095
We are a different race altogether in this
world. We are realized souls.

242
00:25:34,296 --> 00:25:40,635
There were hardly any number during
the time of Christ, practically nil.

243
00:25:40,836 --> 00:25:46,915
And even before that I was surprised that
in China and other places,

244
00:25:47,116 --> 00:25:54,899
in one age there used to be one guru – one
master. While you are so many masters,

245
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:59,845
but you don’t want to use your power
as a master.

246
00:26:00,046 --> 00:26:04,870
Why not the women use it also? I find women
are more lethargic

247
00:26:05,071 --> 00:26:09,711
than men are in Sahaja Yoga. They should
show – I am a woman Myself,

248
00:26:09,912 --> 00:26:14,126
single-handed I’ve done all this work;
and why shouldn’t you do it?

249
00:26:14,327 --> 00:26:20,339
Because it’s a tremendous task to transform
people all over the world.

250
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:26,979
But it’s very easy for you – if I can
do it, why can’t you do it?

251
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:35,706
But put your complete attention to it that:
‘We are going to work out Sahaja Yoga,

252
00:26:35,907 --> 00:26:39,987
not for ourselves, but for the betterment
of humanity.’

253
00:26:40,188 --> 00:26:45,064
We need it, we need it very much.

254
00:26:45,265 --> 00:26:51,557
Your compassion, your love, is all being
wasted

255
00:26:51,758 --> 00:26:57,626
if you just think about yourself,
your family – what’s the use?

256
00:26:58,108 --> 00:27:01,706
People do that even before Realization.

257
00:27:01,907 --> 00:27:08,423
So what is the use of completely getting
attached to your families,

258
00:27:08,624 --> 00:27:14,478
attached to all other things? You should
get attached to the whole world!

259
00:27:14,679 --> 00:27:20,259
You belong to the whole world now, you are
no more individualistic.

260
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:26,800
No more! Now, as I said, it’s a drop
has become the ocean.

261
00:27:27,001 --> 00:27:34,276
Identify yourself with the ocean. Ocean is
the lowest, if you have seen,

262
00:27:34,477 --> 00:27:40,376
lowest so much that the zero point starts
from the ocean.

263
00:27:40,577 --> 00:27:46,776
Ocean is so humble. It’s the lowest point –
it lives,

264
00:27:46,977 --> 00:27:50,626
but all the rivers flow into it.

265
00:27:50,827 --> 00:27:57,870
And the ocean does the work of throwing
clouds in the sky.

266
00:27:58,071 --> 00:28:06,118
And these then burst and become rain
falling to the same ocean.

267
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:12,483
They come back to the same ocean. So those
who are humble

268
00:28:12,684 --> 00:28:16,313
will attract more Sahaja Yogis.

269
00:28:16,514 --> 00:28:21,329
Those who are kind will attract much more
Sahaja Yogis.

270
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:26,680
So it is important to see that you change
your temperament.

271
00:28:26,881 --> 00:28:32,671
If you try to show off, nobody is going
to be impressed by you.

272
00:28:34,702 --> 00:28:41,766
If you think you are something very great,
nobody is going to look at you.

273
00:28:41,967 --> 00:28:51,711
Be very humble, kind, generous – also very
joyous person.

274
00:28:51,912 --> 00:28:56,343
Now imagine a Sahaja Yogi going in a group
and telling them,

275
00:28:56,544 --> 00:29:03,257
“See, my mother is sick, my father is dying
and this thing is happening,

276
00:29:03,458 --> 00:29:11,243
but I am doing Sahaja Yoga.” So people will
say, “Why do you do Sahaja Yoga then?

277
00:29:11,444 --> 00:29:15,485
You go and cry and weep and sit down
there!”

278
00:29:15,686 --> 00:29:23,532
If he’s really doing the Sahaja Yoga, no
sickness can come, no trouble can come.

279
00:29:23,733 --> 00:29:28,991
It is a fact. Try to understand.

280
00:29:29,192 --> 00:29:35,993
With you only these people who are
supposed to be there, they will rise.

281
00:29:36,194 --> 00:29:42,304
But no use having identification with
people who are not Sahaja Yogis.

282
00:29:42,505 --> 00:29:45,866
They may be your relations, they may be
anything. No use,

283
00:29:46,067 --> 00:29:49,663
because you are at a different level, they
are at a different level.

284
00:29:49,864 --> 00:29:55,180
Either try to raise their level, or have
nothing to do with them,

285
00:29:55,381 --> 00:30:00,836
because they will pull you down. They will
not see your height,

286
00:30:01,037 --> 00:30:07,171
they have no eyes to see, they have no ear
to hear,

287
00:30:07,372 --> 00:30:13,836
and they have no feelings of any kind.
If they have seen how you are changed,

288
00:30:14,037 --> 00:30:21,570
how your life is changed, they would have
gone absolutely head-long into Sahaja Yoga.

289
00:30:21,771 --> 00:30:27,415
But if they are not, that’s not your job.
You shouldn’t bother about them.

290
00:30:27,616 --> 00:30:31,985
If they come to Sahaja Yoga, well and good,
otherwise they are no your relations.

291
00:30:32,186 --> 00:30:36,834
In no way they are related to you. How will
you relate Sahaja Yoga to them?

292
00:30:37,035 --> 00:30:41,015
How will you explain anything to them?
It’s going to be impossible

293
00:30:41,216 --> 00:30:44,053
to talk to these people.

294
00:30:46,084 --> 00:30:50,946
So what I have to tell you today is that
our family which is Sahaja Yoga,

295
00:30:51,147 --> 00:30:58,055
is large, it’s spread in 86 countries, and
it’s doing very well.

296
00:30:58,256 --> 00:31:02,929
But what we have to see – that you do
belong to that ocean,

297
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:07,274
to the great families of Sahaja Yoga.

298
00:31:07,475 --> 00:31:13,553
But it is for you to increase the size
of this.

299
00:31:13,764 --> 00:31:19,532
You have to increase, you have to talk
about it, and you have to change people.

300
00:31:19,733 --> 00:31:28,836
This is your responsibility. You were not
given Sahaja Yoga just for nothing,

301
00:31:29,037 --> 00:31:35,227
you have to produce greater Sahaja Yogis,
better Sahaja Yogis;

302
00:31:35,428 --> 00:31:40,413
and you yourself meditate, not only
meditate

303
00:31:40,614 --> 00:31:46,493
but also attend all the collective programs
as far as possible.

304
00:31:46,694 --> 00:31:51,975
I am happy the way you have stayed on and
have come here.

305
00:31:52,176 --> 00:32:00,961
It has rained – still you are here and you
still are enjoying the Divine bliss.

306
00:32:01,162 --> 00:32:07,038
I again and again bless you from my heart,
and I want you to have

307
00:32:07,239 --> 00:32:12,352
that Shuddha Iccha which is the Kundalini,

308
00:32:12,553 --> 00:32:20,594
want you to have that Shuddha Iccha that is
the pure desire,

309
00:32:20,795 --> 00:32:26,946
not only to become Sahaja Yogis but
to create more Sahaja Yogis.

310
00:32:27,147 --> 00:32:33,045
That is actually your pure desire. You may
not have recognized it,

311
00:32:33,246 --> 00:32:39,055
but unless and until you fulfill that
desire,

312
00:32:39,256 --> 00:32:43,842
you can never be a good Sahaja Yogi.
It’s to spread Sahaja Yoga

313
00:32:44,043 --> 00:32:51,733
in every level, in everywhere, with every
one – that you can do it.

314
00:32:51,934 --> 00:32:57,243
And it will spread very well, and so many
people can be saved.

315
00:32:57,444 --> 00:33:03,602
So many people who are just lost
in the maya of stupidity

316
00:33:03,803 --> 00:33:06,702
will be back on the right path.

317
00:33:06,903 --> 00:33:11,477
How much good you are going to do for them
you just think.

318
00:33:11,678 --> 00:33:15,959
If Me alone has brought so many Sahaja
Yogis,

319
00:33:16,162 --> 00:33:23,430
why can’t you also try and get more Sahaja
Yogis? This world needs Sahaja Yoga.

320
00:33:23,631 --> 00:33:27,321
The whole problem – whenever I see
newspaper, I think, ‘Oh God,

321
00:33:27,522 --> 00:33:31,477
if these people were Sahaja Yogis, there
would have been no problem’.

322
00:33:31,678 --> 00:33:37,475
But I find that still people are roaming
about, and going round and round,

323
00:33:37,676 --> 00:33:43,280
I don’t know, as if they have no brains or
they’ve no understanding

324
00:33:43,488 --> 00:33:49,560
that ‘where is this world going?’ and
‘Who’s going to save this world?’

325
00:33:50,444 --> 00:33:56,569
I am not here to tell you what you should
do in your private life.

326
00:33:56,770 --> 00:34:00,887
But you yourself should know to keep
yourself cleansed

327
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:04,606
and beautiful, what you have to do
to yourself.

328
00:34:04,807 --> 00:34:09,264
Some people are so superficial that it
doesn’t go into their heads.

329
00:34:09,465 --> 00:34:12,858
Sahaja Yoga just doesn’t go into their
heads – very, very superficial.

330
00:34:13,059 --> 00:34:18,170
So forget them. I don’t think they can
be saved. So forget them,

331
00:34:18,371 --> 00:34:22,743
they cannot enjoy. They are worried about
some nonsensical things always.

332
00:34:22,944 --> 00:34:27,928
So with such people you need not – but
there are still so many people,

333
00:34:28,129 --> 00:34:35,328
at least I think 80% people, who are
seeking and you should give them help.

334
00:34:35,529 --> 00:34:38,939
This is one thing, is the desire of your
Mother

335
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:42,886
that you should now take up Sahaja Yoga
upon yourself

336
00:34:43,087 --> 00:34:46,970
and go on telling about this to everyone
who comes.

337
00:34:47,171 --> 00:34:56,131
I mean I don’t want cheap popularity, but I
do want Sahaja Yogis to be made everywhere.
