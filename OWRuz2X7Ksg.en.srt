1
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:08,720
It is a great pleasure for Me,

2
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:12,770
greatest joy

3
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:16,830
to see so many Sahaja Yogis

4
00:00:19,361 --> 00:00:21,770
for the Guru Puja.

5
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,790
It’s very gratifying

6
00:00:27,234 --> 00:00:30,760
to think that there are so many,

7
00:00:31,369 --> 00:00:39,650
so many of you who are disciples.

8
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:50,720
It was never expected

9
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:54,650
that I’ll have so many,

10
00:00:55,290 --> 00:01:00,810
so many people following Me.

11
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:15,810
It is being expected

12
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:20,650
that you all will

13
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:29,620
follow My message of Love.

14
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:38,810
I do not have to say anything for Love.

15
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:50,760
Love is absolute gift,

16
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:01,620
gift of just feeling others.

17
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:08,810
There is no talking about it,

18
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:13,610
discussing about it, nothing;

19
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:20,760
just you feel that Love.

20
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:32,720
To feel the Love, I would say, one has to have a heart,

21
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:36,610
but how can you have a heart?

22
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:44,640
It is not your own doing, it’s all there.

23
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:55,780
So, it is something is already gifted to you, you have it,

24
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:59,800
that you can feel that Love.

25
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:08,840
It’s so much joy - giving, peace - giving.

26
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:17,610
Love has its own qualities

27
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:25,660
and one of the qualities is that Love understands.

28
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:29,730
Its understanding is not in words,

29
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:32,610
not in thought,

30
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:36,610
but understands within.

31
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,780
It can feel within,

32
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:46,840
which is very important.

33
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:52,780
This is the most important part

34
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:56,720
one has to realize

35
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:04,670
that Love you can only feel it.

36
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:08,620
You cannot talk about it,

37
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:11,750
you cannot show about it,

38
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,840
but it is within and you can feel it.

39
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,760
And that is why today

40
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:30,720
is your celebration of the Guru.

41
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,830
It’s the celebration where

42
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:45,640
you can feel that Love for your Guru.

43
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,780
That feeling is within

44
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:58,690
and only in within you can feel that.

45
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:05,770
So, we have to understand it’s not the show,

46
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:11,840
it’s nothing else but just the feeling within

47
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:19,800
that you know that you have Love of the Divine.

48
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,760
This you can have because

49
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:29,840
it is just there.

50
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:32,800
No one can give you,

51
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,620
no one can sell it,

52
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:41,700
no one can share it - it’s just there.

53
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:49,640
And that Love has to be felt and shared.

54
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:55,830
It has nothing to do with others;

55
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:01,810
whether others love you or not makes no difference.

56
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:06,640
It’s within yourself,

57
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,620
this feeling,

58
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:15,800
this depth is there which you enjoy.

59
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:26,740
It is the capacity -

60
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:32,690
every one has this, lots of it.

61
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:38,830
Sometimes you feel it, you have lost it;

62
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:42,720
Sometimes you feel you have gained it.

63
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:54,680
But it is there as much as the expanse of a sea.

64
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:57,760
Sea, you cannot say

65
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,820
today is full and tomorrow is not.

66
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:04,740
It is eternal.

67
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:12,690
In the same way, the source of your Love is eternal.

68
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:21,790
You cannot measure it,

69
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:30,660
it’s difficult.

70
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:37,720
But it’s beyond all your human expressions

71
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:49,740
and it shows your understanding,

72
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:53,760
your understanding of Love,

73
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:56,740
which has no words,

74
00:07:57,770 --> 00:07:59,760
which cannot explain;

75
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:03,710
but by itself you will know

76
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:08,740
that "I have this quality to love

77
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,760
within myself

78
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:17,770
and I can enjoy with this Love within myself."

79
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:28,690
This is a very unique gift

80
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:38,660
which only very few human beings have.

81
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:46,770
Among animals also you find people who have love,

82
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:52,660
but that love is not deep,

83
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:56,630
that love has no meaning.

84
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:03,710
It has some purpose maybe,

85
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:06,840
but it is not human,

86
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:12,790
so, it lacks the beauty of human Love,

87
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:21,740
It lacks the understanding of human Love.

88
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:27,850
It is not easy to describe

89
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:33,850
or explain Love in human words.

90
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:39,660
This you can only feel within your Self.

91
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:44,760
That is what, once you start feeling,

92
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:50,760
you can feel who is your Guru,

93
00:09:52,710 --> 00:10:00,800
Whom do you think you are being taught

94
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:08,660
and persuaded and made to live in a particular manner.

95
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,760
All that is possible.

96
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:16,850
Everything is possible,

97
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:19,660
humanly possible,

98
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:25,650
but to love and to enjoy Love

99
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:28,680
is not so easy,

100
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:33,730
unless and until you are immersed in it.

101
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:42,620
It’s very gratifying,

102
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:47,800
it is very lovable

103
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:52,790
to see how people love each other

104
00:10:55,790 --> 00:11:03,850
and then this Love spreads.

105
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,800
Love begets Love.

106
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:19,620
If somebody has Love, it just spreads.

107
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:22,660
You need not tell anyone,

108
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:25,820
you need not confess it,

109
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:30,710
but it will spread.

110
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:36,770
And this is what one has to learn,

111
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:43,770
how to see that Love in other person.

112
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:50,680
Somehow,

113
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:56,750
we are here already in Love

114
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:01,850
because of Sahaj happening.

115
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:05,800
We all love

116
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,750
and we enjoy love,

117
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:11,710
shows on our faces

118
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,850
that we are in Love;

119
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:18,630
in our characters,

120
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,640
in our lives,

121
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:25,630
that we are in Love.

122
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,660
What a thing,

123
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:32,740
which is not very normal,

124
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,850
becomes so normal

125
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:38,690
and so easily available.

126
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:42,750
It is a very big blessing

127
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,850
that you are human beings

128
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:52,700
and that this source of Love

129
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:59,690
is there, plus the feeling for Love is there.

130
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:04,850
It’s a very intricate situation

131
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:09,660
which cannot be explained in words,

132
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:15,670
only one can be in it

133
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,780
and enjoy it.

134
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:22,740
So today is the day

135
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:28,830
when we are celebrating the Guru Puja.

136
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:38,750
The greatest Guru that we have is Love,

137
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:46,670
Sahaj Love. It's the Guru within us which teaches us,

138
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:49,770
which somehow or other leads us.

139
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:54,850
We are lead into that

140
00:13:55,750 --> 00:14:02,710
great line of understanding,

141
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:07,690
for which we don’t have to go to any college,

142
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,770
to any school for education.

143
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:14,610
It is something so much within

144
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:24,740
that it works and expresses itself,

145
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:28,770
expresses like a light.

146
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:33,660
Such people we can make out because

147
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:36,690
they are fully enlightened.

148
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:39,660
They have light

149
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:42,630
and through that light they see

150
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:44,700
the whole world,

151
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:49,610
which is very innocent and simple for them.

152
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:03,720
We have love for our children naturally,

153
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:07,710
we have love for our parents naturally.

154
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:12,610
We have love for some people;

155
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:14,770
but that love is different

156
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:18,690
from God’s Love, I’m telling you.

157
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:23,740
That has some connections,

158
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:25,820
some meanings

159
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:35,800
but this Love which is -

160
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:43,740
cannot be described in words,

161
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:46,720
has to be felt within.

162
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:52,810
Same, when you talk of your Guru,

163
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:58,850
you should have that Love within you.

164
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:05,690
Why do you feel it so much?

165
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:14,740
The reason is, Guru loves you

166
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,800
and you love Guru;

167
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:20,850
That’s the only reason

168
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:24,720
why should you love your Guru.

169
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:27,850
Now, there's no reason for that.

170
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:31,660
Because Love is Love.

171
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:34,670
and that is how

172
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:39,850
the Guru becomes very important in life.

173
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:43,630
We have people

174
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:47,780
who love their Guru

175
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:51,770
and are very much

176
00:16:53,800 --> 00:17:02,630
in chaste understanding of their Love.

177
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:09,660
In this great opportunity of Love that we are,

178
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:16,770
we are here to enjoy each other fully,

179
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:19,690
from our heart,

180
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:26,770
that there is this ocean within us,

181
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:32,640
we have to just get submerged in that ocean.

182
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:35,630
If we are lost in that ocean,

183
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:39,770
then we’ll have no problems,

184
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,690
no questions.

185
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,740
Everything will be our own

186
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,710
and we can manage

187
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:55,710
everything without any argument,

188
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:58,830
without any questioning.

189
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:04,850
That is what is being Sahaj.

190
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:08,640
The Sahaj way, if you have

191
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:12,660
this Love, you enjoy.

192
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:16,640
You enjoy yourself and enjoy everybody else,

193
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:18,820
because it is Sahaj.

194
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,740
Don’t have to make any efforts,

195
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:24,710
don’t have to try anything.

196
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,820
Just it is there and it works.

197
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:40,710
The feeling of Love

198
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:47,720
has no way of expressing itself.

199
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:51,690
It is just there,

200
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,680
it cannot express,

201
00:18:55,820 --> 00:19:00,800
because it is without expression.

202
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:07,830
It is just to be felt within yourself.

203
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:12,820
Then you want to do so many things:

204
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:16,660
you want to help everyone,

205
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:19,660
you want to help yourself,

206
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,770
you want to do good to others.

207
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:30,800
So much has been done by great leaders of the world

208
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:33,820
because they had that Love.

209
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,610
They had nothing else but this Love

210
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:41,750
which they could not contain them within themselves,

211
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:45,850
so, they tried to spread it.

212
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:50,770
And they are called now as our Guru,

213
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,770
as our masters.

214
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:56,810
With that Love within,

215
00:19:57,810 --> 00:20:03,850
which approached people in that unique manner.

216
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,820
That’s the thing that

217
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:11,810
we cannot possess,

218
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,700
you cannot claim -

219
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:17,850
it is there

220
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:20,850
and it works,

221
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:24,700
it works automatically.

222
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:28,810
This is what we have to know,

223
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:35,730
that we are that Love.

224
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:38,810
That Love is within us.

225
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:43,810
We have to have knowledge,

226
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:48,670
we have to have a complete knowledge

227
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:53,630
that we are that Love.

228
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:57,770
That will solve our problem,

229
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:00,780
because you can explain everything,

230
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:02,780
all your behaviour,

231
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,610
all your failures,

232
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:07,820
everything you can explain

233
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:13,640
when you know that you are endowed with that Love.

234
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:18,780
This is what is the Guru

235
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:22,640
is the Love within you

236
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:24,850
which wants to share

237
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,750
Love with others,

238
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:32,820
which wants to give Love to others.

239
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:42,670
This is what is peace and joy.

240
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:46,780
I can go on talking on Love,

241
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:51,780
but to feel it

242
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:57,760
within yourself is the biggest thing.

243
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:00,700
Like water:

244
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,790
if you are thirsty,

245
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,670
we can give you water,

246
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:07,810
but we cannot drink.

247
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,680
You have to drink water

248
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:12,840
and you have to

249
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:17,780
feel the taste,

250
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,640
feel the feeling,

251
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,710
what it does,

252
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:26,850
and all that is together,

253
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:30,710
that’s not separate.

254
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,820
I don’t think the subject

255
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:35,790
was too subtle for you people.

256
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:39,710
You all have reached a certain amount

257
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:42,820
of understanding of that Love.

258
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:48,680
I hope, it grows

259
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,730
and you grow into it,

260
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,700
all of you, and enjoy it.

261
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:58,750
May God bless you!
