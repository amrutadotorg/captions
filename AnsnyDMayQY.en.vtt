07:04.990 --> 07:07.070
Can we start with Your childhood?

07:07.156 --> 07:09.338
-Yes.
- Do You, can describe a little bit

07:09.539 --> 07:12.855
the circumstances where you were grown up?

07:13.056 --> 07:16.319
- My family?
- Yes.

07:20.657 --> 07:27.127
I belong to a family of very enlightened people.

07:27.328 --> 07:31.956
My father was a linguist

07:32.147 --> 07:35.050
and he was master of fourteen languages.

07:35.251 --> 07:38.363
He knew about twenty-six languages

07:38.564 --> 07:45.663
and he translated even Koran-e-Sharif into Hindi language.

07:45.864 --> 07:51.116
My Mother was in those days

07:51.317 --> 07:55.237
was a honors in mathematics.

07:55.438 --> 08:01.696
So both were very well educated and enlightened people.

08:05.317 --> 08:09.595
At the time of My birth,

08:09.896 --> 08:12.777
My mother dreamt

08:14.019 --> 08:16.364
something which she could not explain,

08:16.565 --> 08:20.749
but after that she had a great desire to go and see a tiger

08:20.950 --> 08:23.495
in the open field.

08:23.696 --> 08:26.109
My father was a great hunter,

08:26.300 --> 08:30.015
because tigers were a menace in the area where we were living.

08:30.216 --> 08:34.488
It was a hill station called Chhindwara.

08:34.689 --> 08:38.656
So there was a king who was very much interested in My father.

08:38.857 --> 08:40.997
Somehow or the other a letter came that

08:41.198 --> 08:45.145
there’s a tiger, a very big tiger that has appeared

08:45.346 --> 08:49.609
and they are frightened of him that he might be a man-eater.

08:49.810 --> 08:55.608
So My father took My Mother and Me to that place.

08:56.295 --> 08:59.251
And they were sitting what we call as a machhan,

08:59.452 --> 09:05.168
where they built something, for people to sit on top of a tree,

09:05.369 --> 09:09.193
from where they can shoot nicely.

09:10.730 --> 09:14.091
And then My mother tells Me that a big huge tiger

09:14.292 --> 09:19.988
of a very big size, very beautifully appeared on the field.

09:20.189 --> 09:23.879
And she felt tremendous love for the tiger.

09:24.080 --> 09:29.718
It was a full moon day and she felt

09:30.688 --> 09:34.098
extremely compassionate towards the tiger.

09:34.299 --> 09:37.285
And when My father raised his gun to shoot,

09:37.486 --> 09:40.022
she stopped him and she wouldn’t allow him.

09:40.223 --> 09:45.215
And the tiger went away and he never came to that forest again.

09:46.146 --> 09:48.597
But that made My father think -

09:48.798 --> 09:51.719
because he himself was a realized soul -

09:51.846 --> 09:56.032
that must be somebody,

09:56.233 --> 10:01.712
what we call a Goddess Durga who is fond of  a tiger

10:01.913 --> 10:05.237
must be born to My mother,

10:05.342 --> 10:08.014
because the symptoms were rather funny

10:08.215 --> 10:10.964
that a lady should like to see a tiger and all.

10:11.165 --> 10:13.461
So he told My mother, “Now are you satisfied?”

10:13.662 --> 10:15.401
because they were struggling with the gun.

10:15.528 --> 10:18.352
He said, “Is there a Durga sitting in your womb

10:18.553 --> 10:21.981
that you are trying to protect the tiger?”

10:22.182 --> 10:25.821
She said, “Yes, yes, so stop it now. I won’t allow you.”

10:26.381 --> 10:28.701
Like that there were many incidents in My life

10:28.902 --> 10:33.813
because I am of a Christian family – protestants –

10:34.014 --> 10:37.474
and when I was born My mother didn’t feel any labor pains or anything

10:37.675 --> 10:40.147
and just I was born; she didn’t know how.

10:40.419 --> 10:44.714
And I had no blood on My body, nothing, I was clean washed.

10:44.915 --> 10:48.227
That’s why they called My name as Nirmala.

10:49.235 --> 10:54.052
But My grandmother said that She should be called as Nishkalanka,

10:54.271 --> 10:56.554
that means the one which has no spots on it.

10:56.755 --> 10:58.731
But that’s the name of man.

10:58.932 --> 11:00.871
So they said, “All right, we'll call Her Nirmala

11:01.072 --> 11:03.632
meaning the same, Immaculata.”

11:04.895 --> 11:08.908
Now all these incidents, and then My Father being a realized soul,

11:09.109 --> 11:12.326
he felt tremendous vibrations from Me,

11:12.569 --> 11:15.997
and he felt that this life is great

11:16.182 --> 11:21.526
and She will do something great in this life.

11:22.153 --> 11:23.724
I do not know why, but

11:23.925 --> 11:27.214
I don’t know if he dreamt or he understood it, but

11:27.415 --> 11:30.309
all the time if I remember when he talked to Me,

11:30.510 --> 11:33.629
he used to say that, "You have to find out a way

11:33.830 --> 11:37.906
of giving en masse Realization, all the time".

11:38.107 --> 11:41.635
As I told you, he was a great scholar of so many things,

11:41.836 --> 11:44.795
and a very widely read man.

11:44.996 --> 11:49.802
So he gave Me a good education in religion,

11:50.003 --> 11:51.807
in different religions,

11:52.008 --> 11:55.224
and also good education about human beings,

11:55.425 --> 11:57.146
what are their problems,

11:57.347 --> 12:00.491
why they react like this, why don’t they take to God,

12:00.692 --> 12:02.520
why are they hypocritical.

12:02.803 --> 12:05.583
All kinds of things he talked to Me.

12:05.811 --> 12:08.920
He also knew about Kundalini, but not so much.

12:09.444 --> 12:12.323
Of course, when I was born

12:12.524 --> 12:15.607
I knew about Kundalini myself.

12:15.808 --> 12:18.099
I knew all about it from My very childhood.

12:18.300 --> 12:21.361
I was a very aware person, extremely aware.

12:21.562 --> 12:22.985
But I didn’t know whom to talk to

12:23.186 --> 12:25.527
because, see, people didn’t have that awareness.

12:25.728 --> 12:28.200
You can’t talk to everyone like that.

12:28.401 --> 12:30.719
So I was regarded as a very jolly person,

12:30.920 --> 12:35.407
at the same time very serious also, very deep,

12:35.608 --> 12:39.344
and then I started my studies as a child.

12:41.330 --> 12:42.764
I was not very much interested

12:42.965 --> 12:45.761
in the studies but I used to do very well,

12:45.962 --> 12:50.124
but I used to read lives of great men and things like that.

12:50.325 --> 12:53.791
At a very young age I read Bernard Shaw.

12:53.992 --> 12:56.472
When people were reading just Great Expectations,

12:56.673 --> 12:58.870
I was reading Bernard Shaw.

12:59.071 --> 13:02.574
But as such I didn’t have interest in particularly reading

13:02.788 --> 13:05.555
some text books because I thought they were childish,

13:05.756 --> 13:08.762
and there is nothing to be read about it.

13:08.963 --> 13:11.323
Then I told My father that “I have to do medicine.”

13:11.524 --> 13:14.741
So he said, “Why?” I said, “Because I have to talk to doctors.”

13:14.942 --> 13:17.910
He said, “You have to talk to doctors?” “Yes”, I said.

13:18.111 --> 13:20.317
But it so happened in My childhood

13:20.518 --> 13:23.245
when I was about seven years of age,

13:23.446 --> 13:25.349
My father was a congressman,

13:25.550 --> 13:28.571
he had joined Congress when I was four years of age.

13:28.772 --> 13:31.140
He used to live with a style, very westernized.

13:31.341 --> 13:33.982
His clothes were stitched in London, sort of a man.

13:34.509 --> 13:36.225
We had governesses and all that.

13:36.426 --> 13:40.114
He threw away everything and he became a real Indian

13:40.315 --> 13:44.285
and started leading a life of a martyr.

13:45.865 --> 13:50.696
Then he made us study our languages, Sanskrit...

13:50.896 --> 13:54.871
He made Me study in an Indian school, not in a missionary school,

13:55.072 --> 13:57.239
because missionaries were very unkind.

13:57.440 --> 14:00.326
They threw us out of the school when My father was in the Congress.

14:00.527 --> 14:03.040
They were against us completely.

14:03.860 --> 14:08.733
Then at the age of seven years I happened to go with My Father

14:08.916 --> 14:12.293
to Mahatma Gandhi.

14:12.494 --> 14:14.913
He was about seventy miles, living with us,

14:15.114 --> 14:17.209
but the first time he took Me down.

14:17.410 --> 14:19.000
And Mahatma Gandhi liked Me very much.

14:19.201 --> 14:21.366
He said, “Leave this child with me.”

14:21.567 --> 14:24.349
So, I had not even taken clothes or anything. I stayed on;

14:24.612 --> 14:29.618
then My Father sent Me everything with him.

14:29.842 --> 14:33.042
And he was very fond of Me, but I was a little girl,

14:33.243 --> 14:35.783
but he understood that there was something about Me.

14:35.984 --> 14:40.884
He consulted Me on very serious problems sometimes, surprisingly.

14:41.085 --> 14:43.493
Like one day he wanted to

14:43.694 --> 14:46.527
make the Prayer Book all right.

14:46.892 --> 14:50.104
So, he asked Me, “How should I put the series?” and all that.

14:50.305 --> 14:52.702
So I told him how to put the series

14:52.903 --> 14:55.645
and he put the series in that way.

14:55.846 --> 15:00.364
I used to go back for My school and again go back to Gandhiji,

15:00.565 --> 15:04.469
every year, like that. And he called Me Nepali.

15:04.670 --> 15:06.345
He'd given Me a name Nepali.

15:06.546 --> 15:09.391
Everybody used to call Me Nepali that time.

15:10.028 --> 15:14.205
Then I grew up with him very intimately.

15:14.406 --> 15:16.841
He was a very, very kind person for children,

15:17.042 --> 15:19.112
otherwise an extremely strict man,

15:19.313 --> 15:23.545
with himself and with others, very strict, a big disciplinarian.

15:23.746 --> 15:27.290
And he would make everybody get up at four o’clock,

15:27.491 --> 15:31.116
have your baths, everything, be ready for your morning prayers

15:31.317 --> 15:33.603
at five o’clock, you see, and he used to walk very fast.

15:33.804 --> 15:35.557
I also learnt walking fast with him.

15:35.758 --> 15:38.420
In his company I had to walk fast.

15:38.669 --> 15:42.312
And he was extremely loving and a very nice person,

15:42.513 --> 15:45.240
and he would listen to Me because I was a child, you see.

15:45.441 --> 15:47.481
Supposing I forced him to eat more or something,

15:47.682 --> 15:50.395
then he would, in laugh he would accept.

15:50.596 --> 15:52.528
Very kindly person.

15:52.729 --> 15:55.295
But with others was very strict, and I used to tell him that,

15:55.496 --> 15:58.043
“Why are you strict with everyone?”

15:58.446 --> 16:01.239
He said, “But You are a little girl, You get up in the morning time.

16:01.440 --> 16:04.089
Why can’t they get up?” I said, “I am little. That’s why I get up.

16:04.290 --> 16:08.695
They are big so they can’t get up”; like that, you see, little chats.

16:09.096 --> 16:11.156
And then My father went to jail

16:11.357 --> 16:13.083
and My mother also went to jail five times.

16:13.284 --> 16:15.495
My father went to jail twice,

16:15.696 --> 16:17.504
once for about two and a half years,

16:17.705 --> 16:20.694
and he was the only supporting member of the family.

16:20.965 --> 16:24.769
By the way, we come from a very old royal family,

16:24.986 --> 16:30.261
which is called as Shalivahanas. They have a Calendar also in India.

16:30.462 --> 16:36.895
And then when we, I mean when they took My father to jail,

16:37.096 --> 16:39.633
we had to leave our house and we had to live in huts

16:39.834 --> 16:42.586
and in all problems, that was nothing.

16:42.787 --> 16:43.947
But also Me

16:44.146 --> 16:46.891
they pestered a lot, because I helped many people there

16:47.092 --> 16:50.050
and I joined the ’42 movement in a very serious way

16:50.251 --> 16:52.438
and I became the leader here for the young people.

16:52.639 --> 16:56.236
I thought unless and until I take a very positive stand,

16:56.437 --> 16:59.069
it may not work out with them.

17:00.796 --> 17:04.801
It’s not gracious to say how they tortured Me, what they did to Me,

17:05.002 --> 17:06.259
but they really tortured Me.

17:06.460 --> 17:09.639
I was a young girl of nineteen years that time.

17:10.197 --> 17:14.470
It is over now. So, it’s finished, and after that we,

17:14.671 --> 17:17.161
My father went to jail again

17:17.336 --> 17:19.253
and then when he came back

17:19.454 --> 17:24.277
he got elected as the member of the Central Assembly later on,

17:24.478 --> 17:28.226
as the Constituent Assembly and then at the Parliament.

17:28.427 --> 17:32.083
My brother was also a member of the Parliament, later on.

17:32.284 --> 17:37.218
Now, recently, he was the Minister in the Cabinet.

17:37.419 --> 17:42.035
Another brother is a High Court judge in Bombay.

17:42.236 --> 17:44.276
They are all doing well, despite the fact

17:44.477 --> 17:47.533
that our parents neglected us in a way

17:47.734 --> 17:49.730
because they gave their lives for the country

17:49.931 --> 17:52.866
but, you see, that never deterred us from studies

17:53.067 --> 17:55.246
and we came up very well.

17:55.509 --> 17:57.968
Then I, when I was in the ’42 movement, you see,

17:58.169 --> 18:00.063
My college rusticated Me

18:00.325 --> 18:02.547
– from the college they threw Me out

18:02.748 --> 18:05.712
and I had to go to another college to study

18:05.863 --> 18:09.730
far away from My house, in Punjab,

18:09.931 --> 18:12.882
where I studied for two years.

18:12.994 --> 18:16.993
Science I did, then I did my medical.

18:17.354 --> 18:22.726
I didn’t do fully because, just after that the ’47 riots broke out,

18:22.927 --> 18:25.178
so our college was closed and I didn’t want to know more

18:25.379 --> 18:28.072
because what I wanted to know I came to know about it.

18:28.335 --> 18:31.701
So I did not need and I got married.

18:32.696 --> 18:34.847
You must have heard My husband was, is now

18:35.048 --> 18:38.645
the Secretary-General of the International Maritime Organization.

18:38.846 --> 18:40.671
He held very high positions.

18:40.872 --> 18:44.721
He was also Secretary to Lal Bahadur Shastri,

18:44.922 --> 18:47.943
who was our Prime Minister, who was a another very great man,

18:48.183 --> 18:51.241
but he did not survive long. If he had survived

18:51.442 --> 18:53.901
things would have been different, I think, for our country

18:54.102 --> 18:57.043
because he was a Gandhian, out and out Gandhian,

18:57.244 --> 19:01.378
and he lived like an ideal Gandhian personality.

19:02.642 --> 19:06.243
So that’s how the life went on.

19:06.444 --> 19:11.890
But inner being was still seeking the way and methods

19:12.091 --> 19:14.553
of giving en masse Realization.

19:15.373 --> 19:20.585
My father said, “Before You do not develop this technique

19:20.786 --> 19:23.678
of giving en masse Realization, don’t talk of religion.

19:23.879 --> 19:26.376
Let nobody know that You know anything about it

19:26.577 --> 19:29.343
because they’ll crucify You,” or

19:29.544 --> 19:31.986
he was rather worried that people won’t understand

19:32.187 --> 19:34.267
or, ‘You may write another Bible or Geeta. No use.

19:34.468 --> 19:37.889
First of all you must give them Realization.

19:38.090 --> 19:39.752
If they get their Realization

19:39.953 --> 19:42.190
then they will realize that there is something about,

19:42.391 --> 19:45.354
above this human awareness”.

19:45.555 --> 19:48.192
For example, he always used to give an analogy -

19:48.393 --> 19:51.095
supposing you are born on the tenth storey

19:51.296 --> 19:52.881
and everybody is on the ground,

19:53.082 --> 19:55.560
you must at least make them climb two storeys,

19:55.761 --> 19:57.679
so they know there is something above it;

19:57.880 --> 19:59.846
otherwise no use talking about it.

20:00.142 --> 20:02.747
And he said this is the mistake

20:02.948 --> 20:05.725
between the saints and the incarnations was

20:05.926 --> 20:09.240
that they never realized that these people are still on the ground,

20:09.441 --> 20:13.387
they have to still enter into the building.

20:13.588 --> 20:15.719
So that is what you have to be very careful

20:15.920 --> 20:19.107
that first of all you must give Realization to people.

20:19.889 --> 20:22.986
So I was seeking the ways and methods,

20:23.187 --> 20:25.209
working it out inside Myself

20:25.410 --> 20:29.113
through My own style of meditation in the sense that

20:29.314 --> 20:31.729
I would work out all the permutations and combinations.

20:31.930 --> 20:34.957
Supposing I met one person, then I would see

20:35.158 --> 20:39.110
what problems that person had, how you can overcome it like that.

20:39.311 --> 20:42.825
I would try to study that person internally.

20:44.016 --> 20:46.517
And I went to many people to find out,

20:46.718 --> 20:49.085
but I found they were great hypocrites.

20:49.286 --> 20:50.892
I saw so many of these gurus.

20:51.093 --> 20:54.995
Most of them I saw them, I was surprised, they were all hypocrites,

20:55.196 --> 20:57.332
money-making and this thing.

20:57.533 --> 21:01.293
And also I went to Rajneesh also, to see him.

21:01.494 --> 21:05.230
Then he said that I should come to his program.

21:05.452 --> 21:06.753
I did not know what sort of man

21:06.954 --> 21:09.173
because he was talking about Geeta and big, big things.

21:09.374 --> 21:11.769
I thought he might be knowing something about it.

21:11.970 --> 21:13.534
I went there, but my husband said,

21:13.735 --> 21:15.399
“No, I won't allow You to go to his camp”

21:15.600 --> 21:18.043
So he arranged his own bungalow and all that for Me.

21:18.244 --> 21:19.680
So I went down there

21:19.881 --> 21:22.553
and there I couldn't see all the things that were going on

21:22.754 --> 21:24.832
and that is the day somehow or other

21:25.070 --> 21:29.146
I said I must open the last chakra. So the last chakra was opened.

21:29.347 --> 21:34.826
And I saw the Kundalini which is the Primordial force within us,

21:35.027 --> 21:38.732
which is the Holy Ghost within us,

21:38.900 --> 21:41.772
rising like a telescope, opening out,

21:42.432 --> 21:46.462
and then I saw the whole thing open

21:46.663 --> 21:50.682
and a big torrential rain of breeze

21:50.897 --> 21:53.951
started flowing through My head all over,

21:54.152 --> 21:56.990
as if, and I felt "I am lost now. I am no more there.

21:57.191 --> 22:00.022
It’s only the Grace is there, that is there."

22:00.223 --> 22:03.236
I saw it completely happening to Me.

22:03.437 --> 22:09.391
And, but I was amazed that when I went to Rajneesh, you see,

22:09.592 --> 22:11.325
because before going I had to say goodbye.

22:11.526 --> 22:13.817
He never realized what had happened or anything.

22:14.018 --> 22:15.116
So I was surprised.

22:15.317 --> 22:18.558
I said, “This man doesn’t know anything about God”,

22:18.759 --> 22:20.959
and then I discovered that they were all hypocrites

22:21.160 --> 22:22.765
and telling lies.

22:22.966 --> 22:28.680
So in 1973 this happened, on 5th of May

22:28.881 --> 22:31.564
’70, 1970, 5-th of May.

22:31.765 --> 22:33.644
And just after that

22:33.845 --> 22:37.704
we had a very big lecture in Jahangir Hall - there's a very big hall -

22:37.905 --> 22:40.859
and thousands of people had come. I told them very frankly

22:41.060 --> 22:43.687
that these are all thugs and these are like this, hypocrites.

22:43.888 --> 22:46.173
Some of them are demoniacs. Some are evil people.

22:46.374 --> 22:49.882
I took their names, everything. I told them, “Don’t go near them.”

22:50.083 --> 22:52.607
There were some foreigners also.

23:25.343 --> 23:29.993
And there were so many others whom I told these things very clearly,

23:30.213 --> 23:32.809
and they got frightened. They said, “You shouldn’t say like this.

23:33.010 --> 23:34.508
They’ll come and murder you. They’ll do..."

23:34.709 --> 23:36.231
”I said, “Let them come and murder Me.”

23:36.432 --> 23:40.188
But nobody did anything. Nobody even went to the courts.

23:40.389 --> 23:45.476
And that’s how, you see, they tried to bring bad name to Me.

23:45.677 --> 23:49.158
They paid money to the newspapers to publish things against Me,

23:49.359 --> 23:51.675
because I said, “You cannot pay money.”

23:51.876 --> 23:56.578
So they thought that I was just trying to, you see, harm them

23:56.779 --> 24:00.185
by saying such a thing that you can’t earn money in the name of God.

24:00.386 --> 24:04.611
If it’s a job you can do it, but God’s work is not a job.

24:04.812 --> 24:09.209
And the struggle started

24:09.446 --> 24:12.502
from the day I started giving Realization,

24:12.703 --> 24:16.866
and I started with one lady who got Realization first.

24:17.082 --> 24:20.923
Then we got about twelve people who got Realization.

24:21.124 --> 24:27.048
In two years I got only about fourteen people Realization.

24:27.377 --> 24:30.208
Then gradually when fourteen people got Realization then

24:30.409 --> 24:33.134
many others started getting Realization.

24:33.335 --> 24:38.465
But I started also curing people because that was helping a lot.

24:38.666 --> 24:43.162
Then My husband got elected to this post

24:43.363 --> 24:45.445
and we had to come to London.

24:45.646 --> 24:47.022
So when I came to London

24:47.223 --> 24:50.870
we had one program in Bhartiya Vidya Bhavan. They arranged it.

24:51.121 --> 24:54.242
So the Indians abroad are not so much interested in God;

24:54.443 --> 24:56.340
they are more interested in money.

24:56.541 --> 24:59.949
So none of the Indians stayed there. They all ran away.

25:00.198 --> 25:05.848
And only the foreigners who were there, were about seven hippies.

25:06.049 --> 25:07.978
So I had to work on them, seven hippies.

25:08.179 --> 25:11.982
For four years I was working on them, to give them Realization.

25:12.183 --> 25:14.694
Very difficult, you see. Their liver was bad.

25:14.895 --> 25:18.486
They had ill health. Their head was off, terrible times.

25:18.687 --> 25:20.778
But in between I used to go to India,

25:20.979 --> 25:22.810
and in India also the work was done.

25:23.011 --> 25:25.109
For three months always I would be in India.

25:25.310 --> 25:27.469
So we started working in the villages,

25:27.670 --> 25:30.709
specially surprisingly where My forefathers were ruling,

25:30.910 --> 25:34.218
in that area, the work started moving in a very big way.

25:34.419 --> 25:38.151
And there then we started taking some people from India.

25:38.352 --> 25:43.138
Then some people came from Australia to India, like that,

25:43.384 --> 25:47.523
and the work started moving in those directions.

25:47.724 --> 25:50.943
Then gradually the work improved and people found

25:51.144 --> 25:54.190
that this is the way we can transform ourselves.

25:54.391 --> 25:57.512
Many people who were taking drugs or alcoholic

25:57.713 --> 26:00.313
or mad people, or cancer people ,

26:00.514 --> 26:02.908
they felt better, then they got cured

26:03.109 --> 26:08.281
and it was established that Sahaja Yoga is something very important.

26:09.868 --> 26:12.862
Now when I travel all over the world,

26:13.063 --> 26:16.099
you see, first My husband used to pay for everything.

26:16.300 --> 26:18.705
Wherever I went, he had to pay all.

26:18.906 --> 26:21.086
Any expenses he used to do for Me.

26:21.287 --> 26:24.520
Gradually, then now, these people pay for My travel,

26:24.721 --> 26:28.653
but otherwise they don’t have to pay for anything else

26:28.879 --> 26:33.024
That’s how we started our work. There was lot of opposition

26:33.225 --> 26:37.626
and the media people would never understand it,

26:37.827 --> 26:41.842
because it was no such a sensation as you can say,

26:42.043 --> 26:43.771
nothing to people feel excited.

26:43.972 --> 26:45.491
But in a way it’s a very great thing,

26:45.692 --> 26:48.617
because if this is the solution for the whole world.

26:48.818 --> 26:50.580
One should try to do it.

26:50.781 --> 26:55.573
Then we had very great people who came to Sahaja Yoga,

26:55.774 --> 26:59.935
like, we can say,

27:00.136 --> 27:05.091
the Hague High Court judge, who is now the President,

27:05.366 --> 27:09.822
who has given Nicaragua, this thing judgment.

27:10.065 --> 27:14.151
He and many lawyers and many barristers.

27:14.352 --> 27:17.675
We have one barrister here from Algeria,

27:17.876 --> 27:20.229
and doctors, and then they took over

27:20.430 --> 27:24.942
and they started helping Me out how to propagate Sahaja Yoga.

27:26.550 --> 27:28.845
But it was a difficult task in the West.

27:29.046 --> 27:31.548
Of course, in India it spread very fast in the villages

27:31.749 --> 27:33.737
but city people in India also

27:33.968 --> 27:36.513
are westernized and they start analyzing.

27:36.714 --> 27:38.699
They don’t know much about our past.

27:38.900 --> 27:41.155
They don’t know anything about our heritage,

27:41.235 --> 27:43.756
that we have our Kundalini and all that.

27:43.957 --> 27:46.499
But some people do know about self-Realization.

27:46.700 --> 27:48.710
But these gurus could not stick on in India

27:48.911 --> 27:52.366
because nobody would accept them. So they all run away abroad.

27:52.606 --> 27:54.694
And that was something a blessing for Me also

27:54.895 --> 27:57.527
because I didn’t have to fight them there,

27:57.728 --> 28:00.240
and it started working out,

28:00.441 --> 28:03.023
and then people found that it helps in every way,

28:03.280 --> 28:05.941
and they found so many miracles about it,

28:06.142 --> 28:09.813
and that’s how Sahaja Yoga got settled quite a lot.

28:10.014 --> 28:12.035
But still I would say that

28:12.236 --> 28:14.751
we have not been to certain countries so far,

28:14.952 --> 28:19.697
and in the west, I would say that so much work has still to be done.

28:19.898 --> 28:23.011
Because as soon as you start any work in any place,

28:23.212 --> 28:26.368
first of all they want Me to cure people

28:26.569 --> 28:28.870
and to help them with curatives.

28:29.071 --> 28:31.650
Now if I pay attention more to that,

28:31.851 --> 28:35.668
then the main work is to create doctors out of everyone.

28:35.869 --> 28:38.375
That is neglected. Then you become unpopular.

28:38.576 --> 28:41.422
They think, “Oh, She is not sympathetic” and this and that.

28:41.623 --> 28:43.607
But now as we have, everybody can cure now,

28:43.808 --> 28:46.113
everyone. I don’t cure anyone directly.

28:46.314 --> 28:48.719
But they don’t like it. They want I should be there

28:48.920 --> 28:51.383
and their ego to be pampered and all those things are there.

28:51.584 --> 28:52.909
Rather difficult.

28:53.110 --> 28:55.673
It’s not, we are not running an election, you see,

28:55.874 --> 28:58.392
like we should please others sort of thing, is not there.

28:58.593 --> 29:00.691
But whatever is reality,

29:00.892 --> 29:05.608
if a person has intelligence – pure intelligence

29:05.809 --> 29:08.727
– he can see that this is something very different

29:08.928 --> 29:11.486
and for that one has to

29:11.687 --> 29:15.628
understand that you cannot,

29:15.829 --> 29:20.784
you cannot force on anyone that "You get your Realization".

29:20.985 --> 29:25.062
In the same way you cannot force Me that I give you Realization,

29:25.263 --> 29:27.152
because if it does not work, it does not work.

29:27.353 --> 29:28.870
It’s such a living force, you see.

29:29.071 --> 29:31.952
And that upsets them very soon.

29:32.153 --> 29:35.726
I feel that the way

29:35.927 --> 29:40.267
this industrial revolution has come in the west,

29:40.468 --> 29:43.966
people have lost their moorings, perhaps. They are so confused.

29:44.167 --> 29:47.066
With all these gurus coming down here confusing them

29:47.267 --> 29:51.760
and all kinds of new things coming, they don’t know where to look.

29:51.961 --> 29:55.893
But unless and until you get your evolution completed,

29:56.094 --> 29:59.670
unless and until you reach that absolute state of understanding,

29:59.871 --> 30:01.361
the chaos will remain.

30:01.562 --> 30:04.289
So one has to try to get to that.

30:04.490 --> 30:09.439
But one must understand you can’t pay for it. There is no effort.

30:09.640 --> 30:10.798
After getting Realization

30:10.999 --> 30:13.345
they feel so satisfied, they forget about it.

30:13.546 --> 30:16.211
But after that you must know how to give it to others.

30:16.412 --> 30:19.862
As Christ has said that the light which is enlightened,

30:20.063 --> 30:21.960
you do not put it under the table.

30:22.161 --> 30:23.957
That’s how what happens that,

30:24.158 --> 30:27.321
it's a, though we may give Realization at hundred people,

30:27.522 --> 30:31.355
only out of that five to six will come forward to help us out.

30:31.556 --> 30:34.062
But still I must say lot of work has been done.

30:34.263 --> 30:36.927
Especially Austria, I am very proud of Austria.

30:37.128 --> 30:42.178
And the way they have never given Me any problem – never –

30:42.383 --> 30:45.157
and very good people have come out of Austria.

30:45.357 --> 30:51.552
Very balanced, you see, level-headed people, very level-headed.

30:51.753 --> 30:54.410
They are not extremists. They do not go to extremes.

30:54.611 --> 30:58.648
There is no fanaticism about them. They are sensible people,

30:58.849 --> 31:03.263
and something so lucky that Austria was found out

31:03.464 --> 31:06.703
because I never expected that in Austria

31:06.904 --> 31:09.203
there will be so many people. But somehow

31:09.404 --> 31:13.655
like water finds its own level, Sahaja Yoga finds its own level.

31:13.856 --> 31:15.740
We just came down to Austria.

31:15.941 --> 31:20.441
We haven’t been to Norway, to Sweden, Denmark, Finland.

31:20.642 --> 31:23.697
I visited those places because of My husband’s job

31:23.898 --> 31:26.070
but I have not been there.

31:26.271 --> 31:32.563
Now we have sixteen centers in Australia,

31:32.764 --> 31:35.804
and Australia is a very progressive Sahaja Yoga thing.

31:36.005 --> 31:38.876
We have got schools now there. They are running schools

31:39.077 --> 31:45.792
and the teachers are extremely well-behaved and visionaries,

31:45.993 --> 31:48.345
and they look after the children very well.

31:48.591 --> 31:53.293
The Government people sent somebody for observation

31:53.494 --> 31:56.449
and they have remarked that whatever they proclaim,

31:56.650 --> 31:58.198
that’s what they manifest,

31:58.399 --> 32:01.276
and they have given good certificates to us.

32:01.477 --> 32:05.083
But the greatest achievement on the outward life is this,

32:05.284 --> 32:08.576
that Cambridge University has accepted Sahaja Yoga

32:08.777 --> 32:12.540
for a research work, with respect, by one Dr. Lee,

32:12.741 --> 32:15.500
who is doing the research about Sahaja Yoga in Cambridge University.

32:15.701 --> 32:16.840
He is already a Doctor.

32:17.041 --> 32:20.991
And there is another great thing has happened in Delhi University,

32:21.192 --> 32:24.200
that the Delhi University has accepted

32:24.401 --> 32:30.202
that a person can do, only a doctor can do, a PhD,

32:30.403 --> 32:33.172
or we can say the Doctorate in Sahaja Yoga,

32:33.390 --> 32:39.461
and he gets the highest degree called the Doctor of Medicine,

32:39.662 --> 32:44.303
and perhaps maybe after sometime they will allow anyone to do that.

32:44.504 --> 32:46.295
This is about the medicine part of it.

32:46.496 --> 32:49.168
In agriculture we have done lots of research, Myself.

32:49.369 --> 32:52.443
We have somebody here, an expert on agriculture.

32:52.644 --> 32:54.808
He has also done lot of research,

32:55.009 --> 33:00.378
and we found out, that with vibrations we start after Realization,

33:00.579 --> 33:05.176
if you vibrate the water and if you water the plants with that,

33:05.377 --> 33:08.368
then sometimes you might get even ten times more breed.

33:08.569 --> 33:12.849
That’s what they did in India, in one of the Agricultural University.

33:13.050 --> 33:16.068
But here also he’s found out that there’s tremendous difference

33:16.269 --> 33:18.796
between the growth of an ordinary thing.

33:19.045 --> 33:21.586
Another thing we have found out in agriculture,

33:21.787 --> 33:23.708
that if you give vibrations then

33:23.909 --> 33:27.769
even an ordinary cow can give lot of milk.

33:28.401 --> 33:30.814
But if you have hybrid cows then, you see,

33:31.015 --> 33:32.369
it’s not good for the brain,

33:32.583 --> 33:36.472
because a person who takes hybrid milk, also gets hybrid.

33:36.673 --> 33:38.845
I mean his brain becomes little wobbly.

33:39.046 --> 33:42.019
So better to have a pure milk from a cow

33:42.220 --> 33:46.870
which is not been put to this kind of a experimentation.

33:47.071 --> 33:49.406
Moreover, food also, if it’s hybrid food,

33:49.607 --> 33:53.260
it’s not very good for us because that spoils our nerves, I think.

33:53.461 --> 33:57.456
But ordinary seeds you cannot use because they have weakened

33:57.657 --> 33:59.218
and they cannot reproduce.

33:59.419 --> 34:01.957
So when we vibrate them

34:02.158 --> 34:04.706
they produce very well just like,

34:04.907 --> 34:07.268
better than even sometimes, hybrid thing,

34:07.469 --> 34:09.522
and the food, it tastes very well

34:09.723 --> 34:11.671
and it doesn’t give those complications.

34:11.872 --> 34:14.149
So this can help in agriculture in India,

34:14.350 --> 34:17.329
and the government has allotted us lot of land

34:17.530 --> 34:19.696
where we are going to now experiment,

34:19.897 --> 34:22.251
and we are going to start the experimentation there

34:22.452 --> 34:24.809
to show that how we can use this.

34:25.010 --> 34:28.499
But many farmers who are Sahaja Yogis have done a lot of job

34:28.700 --> 34:32.760
and they have discovered that even animals

34:32.961 --> 34:35.419
and this, what you call,

34:35.620 --> 34:39.961
farming, everything is helped very much by vibration.

34:40.162 --> 34:42.579
So it improves the lives of people.

34:42.780 --> 34:46.373
We have on the other side, social side, I can tell you that

34:47.209 --> 34:50.558
we have our marriages – international marriages.

34:50.759 --> 34:54.975
We arrange international marriages between people.

34:55.176 --> 35:00.894
They have to know each other and they are together.

35:01.095 --> 35:05.345
And first of all they are together for one or half month

35:05.546 --> 35:07.210
with us in the tour. They see each other

35:07.411 --> 35:08.826
and their marriages are fixed.

35:09.027 --> 35:12.912
And we have seen that such marriages are extremely successful.

35:13.113 --> 35:15.602
Ninety-nine percent marriages are successful.

35:15.803 --> 35:17.500
Once in a while, maybe a mishap,

35:17.701 --> 35:20.307
but mostly there are no divorces that take place.

35:20.508 --> 35:22.373
Once in a while if it’s not successful

35:22.574 --> 35:24.231
we have no objection to divorce also,

35:24.484 --> 35:26.810
but mostly it is successful and they get children

35:27.011 --> 35:29.011
who are very intelligent,

35:29.202 --> 35:31.877
who are themselves born realized children, mostly.

35:32.078 --> 35:35.737
So the problem is much less and the family life improves.

35:35.938 --> 35:38.829
The quality of life is thousand times better.

35:39.030 --> 35:42.104
People are very joyous, happy, they do not complain,

35:42.305 --> 35:44.402
and they enjoy life and they give to others.

35:44.603 --> 35:47.836
They share what joy they have. So …

35:48.037 --> 35:49.065
I: Can I ask a question?

35:49.266 --> 35:51.001
What do you think are the important points

35:51.202 --> 35:52.835
in the education of children,

35:53.036 --> 35:56.704
what are important to give to the children?

35:56.905 --> 35:59.609
You see, first if they get Realization,

35:59.810 --> 36:02.511
to get first time to that point of Realization...

36:02.712 --> 36:04.742
If they are already born realized no problem,

36:04.943 --> 36:07.326
but if they have, they're given Realization,

36:07.527 --> 36:10.242
then, you see, they start seeing from a different level.

36:10.443 --> 36:14.222
They become the Spirit. So their self-respect, you see, awaken.

36:15.170 --> 36:20.187
Such children behave in a very dignified, elderly manner, you see.

36:20.388 --> 36:22.811
They talk in a very elderly manner

36:23.012 --> 36:25.595
and this gives solutions of all kinds, you see.

36:25.796 --> 36:28.650
And they are tremendous people.

36:28.851 --> 36:32.527
But we have to guide them properly by our own behavior,

36:32.728 --> 36:35.866
how we behave. The greatest thing is how we behave.

36:36.067 --> 36:37.774
That’s how the children learn.

36:37.975 --> 36:41.889
We put the children certain

36:42.090 --> 36:44.439
to some tests, how they are.

36:44.640 --> 36:47.918
We find out if they have any physical problems, we cure them.

36:48.119 --> 36:50.310
If they have mental problem, we cure them.

36:50.511 --> 36:54.222
If they have any other problem, social problem or anything,

36:54.423 --> 36:55.739
we try to help them out.

36:55.940 --> 37:00.379
So that basically if a human being is all right in the childhood,

37:00.580 --> 37:02.990
then fundamentals are all right for the child.

37:03.191 --> 37:04.563
The foundation is laid down.

37:04.764 --> 37:08.953
Then to build a child up into a good quality is not difficult.

37:09.154 --> 37:12.725
So now we find great artists are there,

37:12.926 --> 37:14.947
there are great musicians

37:15.148 --> 37:18.183
and at a very young age they have started playing violin...

37:18.384 --> 37:21.844
I mean suddenly they have become dynamic also and very humble.

37:22.045 --> 37:25.353
They are very humble and self-respectfing and very well-behaved.

37:25.554 --> 37:29.790
It's surprising how the atmosphere is and how it works out.

37:29.991 --> 37:32.873
And the other day the lady asked Me about the women

37:33.074 --> 37:37.199
and I told her that a woman’s power as a mother is very great.

37:37.400 --> 37:39.267
And she felt hurt about it. But I didn’t mean

37:39.468 --> 37:41.397
that you should be just a mother. What I am saying,

37:41.598 --> 37:44.992
she is a mother, means she is compassionate, she is kind,

37:45.193 --> 37:46.938
she is not aggressive like men.

37:47.139 --> 37:48.710
That is a very big quality.

37:48.911 --> 37:51.831
That is a very big power in a woman. That is what I was suggesting

37:52.032 --> 37:53.659
that that is what we have to earn,

37:53.860 --> 37:57.840
is not to compete with men. It's madness to compete with men,

37:58.041 --> 38:01.260
and to go about like that, because...

38:13.225 --> 38:16.939
You see we have to understand that life

38:17.140 --> 38:22.141
has to be enjoyable.

38:22.739 --> 38:25.887
Life is to be a blessing, not to be a misery.

38:26.106 --> 38:29.364
We create our own miseries by these false ideas,

38:29.565 --> 38:34.832
by our own conflictions we have in our mind,

38:35.033 --> 38:37.146
mental projections we have in our mind,

38:37.337 --> 38:40.126
or our own obstinacy – whatever it is.

38:40.327 --> 38:42.606
All these things can be cured

38:42.819 --> 38:44.281
if you take to Sahaja Yoga

38:44.482 --> 38:47.832
because you become a balanced person, level-headed, wise person.

38:48.033 --> 38:49.078
And you become a witness.

38:49.279 --> 38:51.699
The whole thing becomes like a show, like a drama.

38:51.900 --> 38:52.940
And you become fearless,

38:53.141 --> 38:55.080
you start seeing the whole thing like a drama.

38:55.281 --> 38:57.572
And this is what a human being has to achieve.

38:57.773 --> 39:01.167
We talk of peace. We talk of no war.

39:01.368 --> 39:03.351
We talk of many things like this, you see,

39:03.552 --> 39:06.837
atomic bomb, this, that... All that is not going to work out.

39:07.051 --> 39:08.328
Only what is going to work out

39:08.529 --> 39:10.428
is the transformation of human beings.

39:10.629 --> 39:12.385
If the human beings are transformed,

39:12.586 --> 39:15.001
things will work out absolutely first class.

39:15.202 --> 39:20.983
Not only that, but that they will enjoy the bliss of life.

39:21.184 --> 39:23.833
We are missing the point altogether!

39:24.034 --> 39:26.814
This is a very important thing

39:27.015 --> 39:28.933
that human beings must say, one thing:

39:29.134 --> 39:31.663
what have we achieved out of all these?

39:31.864 --> 39:34.215
Just for a minute to stop and think.

39:36.481 --> 39:38.790
What would you say is the definition of illness?

39:38.926 --> 39:41.376
What's the causes of illness?

39:42.223 --> 39:46.110
It’s the physical, mental, emotional, all illnesses are caused

39:46.311 --> 39:50.118
by the imbalances within us, by our extreme behavior.

39:50.319 --> 39:54.117
And supposing say now the cancer. We can take the cancer.

39:54.318 --> 39:57.548
Cancer is caused by the over-activity

39:57.749 --> 40:00.071
of the sympathetic nervous system.

40:00.272 --> 40:05.839
Now supposing a person is a very sad person.

40:06.040 --> 40:09.460
He cries and weeps and all the time feels guilty

40:09.661 --> 40:12.276
and thinks that he is the worst person ever born,

40:12.477 --> 40:15.901
he’s committed so many sins and all sorts of nonsense, you see.

40:16.141 --> 40:18.585
Then he goes to the left side, according to us

40:18.786 --> 40:21.533
and crosses over to the collective subconscious area.

40:21.734 --> 40:25.326
And there, according to us, what they call as Protein 58,

40:25.527 --> 40:28.248
and Protein 52, doctors call it that way,

40:28.449 --> 40:30.521
but we call it as the dead souls;

40:30.722 --> 40:33.069
they exist there and they catch hold of you

40:33.270 --> 40:35.450
and they trigger the cancer.

40:35.651 --> 40:37.084
But supposing by any chance

40:37.285 --> 40:40.748
you can bring the attention fully away from that

40:40.949 --> 40:43.104
in the center you can get cured.

40:43.305 --> 40:47.035
So it is the centers within us which are subtle,

40:47.270 --> 40:49.561
which are basically seven centers.

40:49.762 --> 40:51.744
There are many others, but basically seven.

40:51.921 --> 40:53.297
If you can put them right,

40:53.498 --> 40:57.501
you cannot have any sickness or illness, of any kind.

40:59.002 --> 41:02.339
Let's go back to your childhood.

41:02.609 --> 41:07.259
Can You explain - Your parents

41:07.460 --> 41:10.893
supported You very much in Your learning and in Your studies.

41:11.094 --> 41:13.314
It’s correct? [unclear]

41:13.609 --> 41:16.811
Yes, yes. Of course. You see in...

41:17.012 --> 41:18.621
Is this normal

41:18.758 --> 41:21.583
that parents support the child like You in Your family?

41:21.784 --> 41:24.729
In India, all parents support the child.

41:24.930 --> 41:27.364
- Even if...
- You can learn everything what You want to?

41:27.581 --> 41:29.216
Yes, yes, I mean, that is true.

41:29.454 --> 41:31.257
But you see the basic thing is

41:31.458 --> 41:34.946
parents are very benevolent to children, very kind to children,

41:35.147 --> 41:40.095
and to them, you see, the child’s education, child’s upbringing

41:40.296 --> 41:43.209
and child’s life is very important.

41:43.410 --> 41:47.291
That’s why we know they are, so we depend on them,

41:47.492 --> 41:50.778
they look after us and they are very wise people.

41:50.979 --> 41:52.922
They sacrifice everything for us.

41:53.123 --> 41:56.340
So, whatever they say we think it’s nice

41:56.556 --> 41:59.561
and by doing this we have not lost anything so far.

41:59.777 --> 42:02.005
In India if you find Indian children when they come abroad

42:02.206 --> 42:04.106
they always talk the least anywhere.

42:04.307 --> 42:06.356
They are very obedient children

42:06.557 --> 42:08.856
and they behave very well.

42:09.057 --> 42:11.900
We don’t have all this problem, teenage problem, homosexual.

42:12.101 --> 42:13.975
We don’t know even all this problems are

42:14.176 --> 42:16.585
because we are so close with the parents all the time.

42:16.786 --> 42:19.118
They all the time watch us. We don’t have drug problem,

42:19.319 --> 42:22.099
none of these. Only in the cities, little bit,

42:22.300 --> 42:23.841
it happens and it disappears;

42:24.042 --> 42:26.251
because parents are all the time with their children.

42:26.452 --> 42:28.808
We live together. The whole family lives together.

42:29.009 --> 42:30.664
And not only with the parents

42:30.865 --> 42:33.649
but all the relations and all the people

42:33.850 --> 42:36.765
in the village and the city, everyone knows each other.

42:36.966 --> 42:39.469
Such a joint system we have

42:39.636 --> 42:43.770
that we do not normally,

42:43.971 --> 42:46.986
sort of, go into wrong ways and methods

42:47.187 --> 42:49.702
and we do not become obstinate also.

42:50.377 --> 42:52.793
- But, You grew up in a Christian family in India.
- Yes.

42:52.994 --> 42:54.066
Yes.

42:54.261 --> 42:58.564
It’s not a normal situation, that Indian people are Christian.

42:58.765 --> 43:00.369
Yes, I know. It is, you see,

43:00.570 --> 43:02.911
I was born in a Christian family deliberately,

43:03.094 --> 43:06.958
because I think, you see, I personally think,

43:07.159 --> 43:09.997
that Protestants are the greatest fanatics;

43:10.198 --> 43:12.180
because they are very sophisticated, you see,

43:12.381 --> 43:13.799
their fanaticism is in their brain.

43:14.000 --> 43:15.926
Nobody can make them out of their fanaticism.

43:16.127 --> 43:18.685
They are very great fanatics, the greatest of all.

43:18.886 --> 43:20.982
But My parents were very enlightened people

43:21.183 --> 43:23.215
and they understood Christ very well.

43:23.416 --> 43:26.021
Yesterday I told you about Paul, you see, when I was -

43:26.222 --> 43:28.161
first time I took the Bible in the hand

43:28.362 --> 43:30.097
and I asked My father, “Who is this Paul?”.

43:30.298 --> 43:33.514
He said “He is an intruder. Forget him. Don’t read him at all.”

43:33.715 --> 43:36.106
So you see they understood all these things very well

43:36.307 --> 43:38.409
and because My father was a realized soul,

43:38.610 --> 43:40.821
like Khalil Gibran, you see. If you read Khalil Gibran,

43:41.022 --> 43:43.104
he says the same thing about Paul, the same thing.

43:43.305 --> 43:46.400
So, you see, if you are an enlightened person,

43:46.601 --> 43:48.382
you see the essence of everything.

43:48.583 --> 43:50.332
Whatever religion you may be born,

43:50.507 --> 43:53.387
you don’t ignore any other religion.

43:53.588 --> 43:55.600
You try to learn about other religion,

43:55.801 --> 43:58.332
and you find the essence is the same in every religion.

43:58.607 --> 43:59.743
What is there to fight?

43:59.944 --> 44:01.617
And that’s how you belong to no religion,

44:01.818 --> 44:04.659
you belong to every religion. That’s what happens.

44:04.860 --> 44:07.828
But My parents were very enlightened people, I must say,

44:08.029 --> 44:11.775
and I was very lucky to choose them as My parents.

44:12.828 --> 44:15.322
You have been an enlightened child, is it correct?

44:15.523 --> 44:18.019
- I beg your pardon?
- You had been an enlightened child?

44:18.220 --> 44:20.082
Yes, I have been born as an enlightened child.

44:20.283 --> 44:23.234
But You don’t feel sometimes very lonesome,

44:23.435 --> 44:28.035
because all the others are different?

44:28.444 --> 44:32.074
No, no, that is, you see, if you know how to share with others...

44:32.275 --> 44:36.090
Actually I was like a Mother to them from My very childhood.

44:36.291 --> 44:38.573
When My father, mother went to jail I was,

44:38.774 --> 44:41.658
first time, I was about, I think five and a half years of age.

44:41.859 --> 44:46.496
So I had all the keys of the house in My little frock thing,

44:46.697 --> 44:49.778
and I used to carry all the duties like a grandmother.

44:49.979 --> 44:51.809
I never felt lost. I mean,

44:52.010 --> 44:54.558
My life is on the whole is very collective,

44:54.759 --> 44:57.222
by temperament I am extremely collective.

44:57.423 --> 44:59.839
I can live anywhere. I can sleep anywhere.

45:00.040 --> 45:01.929
I can live in the jungles. I can...

45:02.130 --> 45:05.744
I have no problems of that. I am extremely collective.

45:05.945 --> 45:09.443
I am not exclusive by temperament, from very childhood.

45:09.644 --> 45:12.217
I was very friendly with all the people

45:12.418 --> 45:14.549
in that area where we were living

45:14.750 --> 45:17.016
and My mother was known as Nirmala’s mother,

45:17.217 --> 45:18.795
father was known as Nirmala’s father.

45:18.996 --> 45:21.707
So they said, “We have lost our identity because of Her”.

45:21.908 --> 45:25.440
So I was a very friendly person. I never felt lonely,

45:25.641 --> 45:28.207
and when I am with Myself I am never lonely at all.

45:28.408 --> 45:31.045
I enjoy Myself very much.

45:34.247 --> 45:38.185
When You had been to the ashram with Gandhi,

45:38.386 --> 45:42.574
can You mention one or two impressions You remember

45:42.775 --> 45:44.929
about Gandhi?

45:45.130 --> 45:46.755
Oh! Gandhiji was a tremendous man.

45:46.956 --> 45:49.018
One has to learn a lot from him.

45:49.219 --> 45:52.731
He was not at all a hypocrite, that’s one thing.

45:52.932 --> 45:57.215
And he was not like modern, we say, politicians,

45:57.416 --> 46:01.177
who says something, do something. No, he was very outspoken

46:01.378 --> 46:05.518
and always put himself on the testing point.

46:05.727 --> 46:09.711
And he used to confess if he made mistakes, immediately.

46:09.912 --> 46:14.196
One very great incident I remember, when I was a small child.

46:14.397 --> 46:17.662
They were having a meeting together

46:17.863 --> 46:21.480
and we girls were there only sitting giving them

46:21.681 --> 46:23.534
water and things, to all the people.

46:23.735 --> 46:27.103
All the big people were there, like...

46:27.312 --> 46:30.495
Jawaharlal Lal Nehru was there and also Maulana Azad,

46:30.696 --> 46:32.557
all these people were sitting there.

46:32.758 --> 46:35.730
They were discussing something and then suddenly

46:35.931 --> 46:39.893
Mahatmaji said that, “Now it’s very late. We’ll have lunch here.”

46:40.563 --> 46:43.455
So they said, “Yes, yes, we’ll have lunch here.”

46:43.656 --> 46:46.313
They had to go to the guest house which was far away.

46:46.514 --> 46:51.810
So Mahatmaji asked for the Baa, is his wife. She had gone out.

46:52.011 --> 46:54.092
So he got up. He had a key with him,

46:54.293 --> 46:56.011
you see, always of the store room.

46:56.178 --> 46:57.415
He opened the store room,

46:57.616 --> 47:01.116
and he asked the people who were in charge of cooking

47:01.317 --> 47:02.974
to measure everything

47:03.175 --> 47:07.004
according to the people there are, properly, everything, you see.

47:07.205 --> 47:10.714
And then he, and they measured it out, everything was done

47:10.915 --> 47:12.154
then he put the key back,

47:12.355 --> 47:14.660
and then he went and sat there nicely.

47:14.877 --> 47:16.564
So these people said,

47:16.765 --> 47:20.053
“Bapu, we did not know you had to take so much trouble,

47:20.254 --> 47:24.363
you see, to go all the way and measure out everything out for us.”

47:24.564 --> 47:27.323
It did not take much time, about fifteen minutes, but still.

47:27.524 --> 47:29.677
So he said, “What do you think?

47:29.878 --> 47:34.202
This is the blood of my country. I cannot allow it to be wasted”.

47:34.403 --> 47:37.263
See, that’s the sign of a person who understands

47:37.464 --> 47:41.410
the value of public money. That’s just ingrained in him,

47:41.611 --> 47:45.156
but those who saw him also felt

47:45.388 --> 47:49.289
that, "Look at this man, who is living like an ascetic, absolutely,

47:49.490 --> 47:52.525
in the sense that he would not touch the public money".

47:52.726 --> 47:56.239
And that is one of the key, keys for all the leaders.

47:56.440 --> 48:00.078
If they are absolutely above the money,

48:00.279 --> 48:04.541
then only people will respect; otherwise, there is no way out.

48:04.742 --> 48:06.631
But you find these days in every country

48:06.832 --> 48:09.689
so much of corruption, hypocrisy,

48:09.880 --> 48:11.900
then you are really shocked.

48:12.101 --> 48:14.152
What do You think is the reason

48:14.415 --> 48:18.660
of all these corruption, of the political instability?

48:19.317 --> 48:22.529
It’s ignorance. It is ignorance.

48:22.765 --> 48:27.776
They think by having money or by having big position

48:27.977 --> 48:32.734
or by having a big name, they’ll be happy.

48:32.935 --> 48:36.232
They will not be happy. Only the ego will be pampered.

48:36.433 --> 48:39.650
When it is slightly hurt, the person will be unhappy.

48:39.851 --> 48:43.039
So he’ll be going into from happiness to unhappiness.

48:43.240 --> 48:45.835
But when he gets the knowledge

48:46.034 --> 48:49.374
that it is the Spirit which is the source of joy,

48:49.575 --> 48:52.988
then he doesn’t care for money, he doesn’t care for all these things.

48:53.189 --> 48:55.904
He is not afraid of anything. He lives like a Lord himself.

48:56.105 --> 48:58.223
He is a Lord, he doesn’t want anything.

48:58.422 --> 49:00.982
You see, the one who is the Lord doesn’t want anything.

49:01.183 --> 49:04.163
For example, now, as you know, I come from a rich family,

49:04.364 --> 49:05.980
my husband from a rich family.

49:06.235 --> 49:09.553
He’s now well to do. We have very comfortable living,

49:09.771 --> 49:13.155
but I can live in a, on a street, I can sleep on a street,

49:13.356 --> 49:16.766
because I am like a queen. I don’t need anything.

49:16.967 --> 49:19.171
If you need anything then you are a beggar,

49:19.372 --> 49:21.393
otherwise you are a king, isn’t it?

49:21.594 --> 49:24.954
That’s what I feel. So that is what is the ignorance.

49:25.155 --> 49:29.515
Once they know we are just fighting our ignorance

49:29.716 --> 49:31.380
they’ll give it up. It’s nonsense.

49:31.581 --> 49:34.257
It is nonsense and it’s not at all joy giving.

49:34.458 --> 49:36.879
Your virtues are very joy giving.

49:37.080 --> 49:42.252
If you know about your chastity, or you know about your honesty,

49:42.453 --> 49:45.267
or if you know about your straightforwardness,

49:45.468 --> 49:46.869
it’s very joy giving.

49:47.070 --> 49:49.134
You feel so confident, so happy

49:49.335 --> 49:51.861
and such a person never tries to harm anyone,

49:52.062 --> 49:53.484
to be sarcastic with anyone.

49:53.685 --> 49:55.562
Such a person is absolutely free, I should say,

49:55.763 --> 49:58.092
because he has no bondages of any kind.

49:58.293 --> 50:00.512
These are all bondages which bind us

50:00.713 --> 50:03.583
and we become jealous and we become greedy,

50:03.784 --> 50:06.653
we become lusty. All this is nonsense.

50:07.388 --> 50:10.075
It’s to be just seen after getting to your Spirit

50:10.276 --> 50:12.844
that the light shows these are all like snakes, you see,

50:13.045 --> 50:15.855
crawling up on us and we are holding on to snakes.

50:16.056 --> 50:19.426
People when they die, you see - big, big people I have seen -

50:19.627 --> 50:21.429
people tell about them.

50:21.604 --> 50:24.080
In the history they go down as horrible people.

50:24.381 --> 50:26.930
In the history they are described as people who were hypocrites,

50:27.131 --> 50:33.035
who were cruel, who were very, I should say, adamant type,

50:33.236 --> 50:34.896
and all kinds of things is described.

50:35.097 --> 50:38.325
Whatever is genuine remains genuine.

50:40.391 --> 50:43.542
You never, don’t feel frightened?

50:43.724 --> 50:48.464
No, I don’t. I don’t know anything like fear.

50:48.950 --> 50:52.582
What’s there to be afraid of?

50:52.783 --> 50:54.362
I am never afraid of,

50:54.563 --> 50:59.095
because if you believe and you know definitely there is God all over,

50:59.296 --> 51:01.050
there is nothing to be afraid of.

51:01.251 --> 51:04.438
He looks after you every moment, every minute.

51:04.639 --> 51:06.400
Wherever you are, He looks after you.

51:06.601 --> 51:09.199
These people have had so many experiences of that.

51:09.400 --> 51:12.893
There was one girl who was a Sahaja Yogini

51:13.094 --> 51:17.893
and she was driving somewhere in Germany on an Autobahn,

51:18.094 --> 51:19.819
and there were so many cars were with her.

51:20.020 --> 51:22.071
And suddenly her brake failed

51:22.272 --> 51:24.132
and the car started going this way, that way.

51:24.333 --> 51:27.000
She didn’t know how to manage it. She said, “Now, what to do?”

51:27.201 --> 51:29.728
She just... She had another one also with her.

51:29.929 --> 51:31.000
Both of them, they said,

51:31.201 --> 51:33.243
“All right, let us close our eyes and think of Mother.”

51:33.444 --> 51:35.663
They just started thinking of Me and said,

51:35.864 --> 51:38.293
“We’ll not be afraid, just think of Her”.

51:38.501 --> 51:41.055
And suddenly they found that their car had come

51:41.256 --> 51:46.359
to one side of the road very nicely without any scratch.

51:46.877 --> 51:52.375
So, you see, it is just our fear makes us more frantic and stupid.

51:52.576 --> 51:54.995
There is nothing to be afraid of.

51:55.196 --> 51:57.316
It is to be seen how God helps you.

51:57.517 --> 51:59.738
But people don’t want to take His help, you see.

51:59.939 --> 52:03.934
Then God says, “All right, go ahead and break your head. What to do?”

52:05.580 --> 52:08.379
Sometimes other people are helping.

52:08.580 --> 52:11.307
Yes, then you should know how to handle them.

52:11.508 --> 52:14.108
You see, they, for example, yesterday that fellow came.

52:14.309 --> 52:16.218
You see, he just became like a beaten up dog.

52:16.419 --> 52:19.592
You saw him coming and saying something to Me, which you never heard.

52:19.793 --> 52:22.896
But they belong to a cult, some sort of a cult, you see,

52:23.097 --> 52:26.825
and they always oppose us. They have some sort of Christians.

52:27.026 --> 52:31.816
And when I was in Geneva, one of the ladies,

52:32.017 --> 52:37.069
all, you see, dressed up in a very fashionable way,

52:37.270 --> 52:40.469
she came to Me with a Bible in her hand to hit me, you see.

52:40.670 --> 52:44.022
And everybody got frightened that now she is going to beat Me.

52:44.223 --> 52:47.499
This woman walked with big high heels upon Me

52:47.700 --> 52:50.501
and I dont know, they thought she’ll do something to Me.

52:50.702 --> 52:52.681
As soon as I saw her with the Bible, you know,

52:52.888 --> 52:54.528
I started laughing, absolutely.

52:54.729 --> 52:57.175
I couldn’t bear. I thought, “Such a joker she is.

52:57.376 --> 52:59.875
She is coming to hit Me with a Bible? How can she do it?”

53:00.076 --> 53:03.111
And she got worried about Me that I am laughing so much.

53:03.312 --> 53:04.524
It’s all on the tape.

53:04.725 --> 53:06.847
And these boys were very much frightened, I've seen.

53:07.048 --> 53:09.513
I was not at all. I said, “It’s perfectly all right,”

53:09.714 --> 53:11.917
and she ran away because she saw Me laughing, you know.

53:12.118 --> 53:15.398
I just couldn’t help [unclear] laughing at the joker,

53:15.599 --> 53:19.007
the way she came to hit Me with a Bible. Imagine!

53:19.208 --> 53:21.406
So this is what it is. If you are afraid

53:21.607 --> 53:24.976
then they sit on your heads. But you should not be afraid.

53:26.499 --> 53:31.081
There's a chinese story that there's one king who took two,

53:31.282 --> 53:37.557
two cocks for fighting to a very realised soul, a guru,

53:37.758 --> 53:40.486
and he said, "You make them all right".

53:40.687 --> 53:42.986
So he said "All right". He trained them for one month,

53:43.187 --> 53:44.720
and they went for a fight.

53:44.946 --> 53:48.799
So many cocks were brought him to fight these.

53:49.000 --> 53:50.802
So these two were standing there,

53:50.970 --> 53:53.428
they would no attack anyone, just standing.

53:53.629 --> 53:55.662
Everybody was attacking, they were just standing.

53:55.863 --> 53:57.462
Everybody got frightened, all the,

53:57.663 --> 54:00.175
all the cocks got frightened and ran away.

54:00.376 --> 54:03.529
And these two were standing there nicely.

54:05.069 --> 54:09.558
You should not attack anyone, nor anybody would attack you.

54:11.303 --> 54:13.038
Yes, they are there, but quite alright.

54:13.239 --> 54:14.900
But I am not frightened of them.

54:15.101 --> 54:18.930
So far nobody has been successful.

54:29.628 --> 54:35.368
P: I request Mataji, if Mataji can explain how to raise the Kundalini,

54:35.569 --> 54:38.415
that may help the guests also.

54:38.616 --> 54:42.575
Explain how to raise the Kundalini.
P: Yes

54:50.993 --> 54:55.331
He wants to know how the Kundalini is raised.

54:55.532 --> 54:59.187
As they explained the, yesterday in German language,

54:59.396 --> 55:03.220
that at the base of our spine,

55:03.421 --> 55:06.765
there is a power lying there,

55:06.966 --> 55:10.329
which is the reflection of the Holy Ghost within us.

55:10.530 --> 55:13.059
And the Spirit lies in the heart

55:13.260 --> 55:16.181
which is the reflection of God Almighty.

55:16.382 --> 55:21.681
So the power of God is the Holy Ghost, is a female power,

55:21.882 --> 55:26.818
because God is a male,

55:27.019 --> 55:31.622
then He has a son. There has to be a Mother to the son.

55:33.589 --> 55:35.965
They didn't want to have a woman there, imagine.

55:36.166 --> 55:38.792
We cannot have women for...

55:38.993 --> 55:41.288
They cannot be ordained. This is too much.

55:41.489 --> 55:43.327
It's not in India like this, you see.

55:43.478 --> 55:45.433
You don't find this kind of a nonsense there

55:45.634 --> 55:48.483
but is here that women have accepted, though you are so advanced.

55:48.699 --> 55:51.454
There, here it is so stupid that women cannot become priests.

55:51.655 --> 55:54.468
Why can't they if the men can be?

55:54.669 --> 55:58.962
So, this, to avoid the women from the whole thing,

55:59.163 --> 56:04.316
they called It a Holy Ghost, without telling that it's a female.

56:04.517 --> 56:06.928
And that female power is the Shakti

56:07.129 --> 56:10.163
which resides in the triangular bone.

56:10.387 --> 56:17.958
Now, what happens, that when a person who is authorised,

56:18.159 --> 56:22.039
in a way that a person who is a realised soul,

56:23.247 --> 56:28.800
is faced by such a person, then the Kundalini spontaneously rises.

56:29.001 --> 56:36.608
Just like in the womb of the Mother Earth if you put any seed,

56:36.809 --> 56:41.431
spontaneously it sprouts because it's a living process.

56:41.676 --> 56:44.648
And it passes through the six chakras.

56:44.849 --> 56:47.873
The seventh is the last chakra, which is the pelvic,

56:48.107 --> 56:49.575
which helps the pelvic plexus.

56:49.776 --> 56:52.027
So it doesn't play any part,

56:52.228 --> 56:56.093
means sex does not play any part in this. You become like a child.

56:56.294 --> 56:58.619
And the Kundalini passes through six centres

56:58.820 --> 57:00.870
ultimately the sixth one is here,

57:01.071 --> 57:06.255
which we call as Sahasrara, meaning thousand petaled lotus.

57:06.456 --> 57:08.692
But actually it is the limbic area,

57:08.893 --> 57:13.269
and at the apex of limbic area here, at the fontanel bone area,

57:13.470 --> 57:14.761
It pierces through,

57:14.962 --> 57:16.423
and you actually start feeling

57:16.624 --> 57:19.010
the cool breeze coming out of your head.

57:19.211 --> 57:21.105
Actually start feeling like that.

57:21.306 --> 57:24.377
So, it just sprouts by itself,

57:24.528 --> 57:27.350
it is a spontaneous happening.

57:31.218 --> 57:33.779
Did you understand?

57:33.980 --> 57:37.196
You are from the country of Krishna, You should know many things.

57:37.397 --> 57:40.345
After coming here, you people have forgotten God.

57:41.182 --> 57:42.364
Is it true or not?
