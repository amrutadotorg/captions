00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:23.720
Today we are celebrating the resurrection of Christ.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.360
With it we have to also celebrate

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.800
the resurrection of human beings,

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.240
of Sahaja Yogis

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:39.120
who have been resurrected as realised souls.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.720
With that we have to understand

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.840
that we enter into a new awareness.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.400
There was no need for Christ

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.080
to enter into any new awareness,

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.120
He had to come down

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.000
and again to show to this world

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.760
that you are the eternal life,

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.120
that you lead a life

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.440
that is spiritual, which never perishes.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.200
You have to rise into that new realm

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.920
which is the realm

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.160
of God Almighty,

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.120
what you call the Kingdom of God.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.960
And He said it very clearly

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.280
to Nicodemus

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.800
that "You have to be born again,"

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.640
and when he asked

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.280
"Am I to enter back into my mother's womb to be born again?"

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.160
And He said it so clearly ! It's so clear.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.040
Those who don't want to see can remain blind,

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.120
but he said it very very clearly;

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.120
that "No, that is,

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.400
whatever is born of the flesh is the flesh,

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:16.120
but whatever is born of the Spirit is the Spirit."

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.120
I mean nothing could be more clear than that,

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:27.120
that it has to be born 'of the Spirit'.

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.280
Of course, human beings have a special capacity

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.760
to twist everything around.

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.120
For them Spirit could be a book,

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.280
could be some words, could be an organisation, a church,

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.880
or some sort of a thing like that which they have made.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.520
But whatever is man-made

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.120
is not the Spirit;

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.120
this is the clear

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.480
statement of Christ, which people wanted to avoid and start

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:00.320
their own organisations, their own ideas

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:07.240
and created a very mythical thing in His name.

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:12.120
And now the time has come for it to be blasted.

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:17.560
It has been going on and on now for thousands of years,

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.400
captured so many innocent people,

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.280
and people are into it.

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:27.520
But when you are resurrected,

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.240
when you become realised souls,

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.520
one has to understand that

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:39.400
now your movement is

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.960
inward,

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.760
you are moving towards your roots and not outside.

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:52.720
So whatever was the endeavour

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.120
before realisation

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.640
has to be changed; the direction has to be changed.

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:05.120
And that point mostly we miss.

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:12.680
This is the thing today I am trying to explain to you:

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:18.480
that so far to a human mind

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.640
entertainment was important; entertaining

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:26.360
to the mind, not to the Spirit.

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.120
Entertainment to the Spirit

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.920
is absolutely opposite

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:37.240
to the entertainment to the mind.

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:43.040
Like somebody the other day telephoned to me and said

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:49.120
that, "Mother, there is no excitement in Sahaja Yoga."

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:59.800
See, excitement is too much.

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:04.200
We are going against that.

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:07.120
We are going towards peace,

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:10.120
not towards excitement and this kind of electric shocks

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:12.640
that we require every time.

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:15.640
See a drunkard

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:19.240
is alright in the morning but evening-time he goes off,

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.800
he needs a shock,

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:24.880
some sort of an injection into his body.

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:30.520
'All' human enterprises have been like that, they are

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.240
to excite your body.

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:37.600
Because if it is the dead you are dealing with,

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:42.120
then you have to excite it. But something that is living,

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:47.720
that is eternal, you have to enjoy it and not excite it.

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:52.120
So the direction has to be

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:59.880
juxtaposition, and that is where many Sahaja yogis fail to understand.

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:05.280
"How do we do it ?" is the point.

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:11.200
"How do we make our attention move inward

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:14.640
instead of going outward."

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.640
If you start

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:23.680
from the time you are born again, it is much easier,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.680
because it is a new venture into you go in, that is the peace.

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:34.120
Peace of your Spirit, the joy of your Spirit,

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:39.200
which is permanent, you don't need any excitement from it, it is permanent,

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:42.360
it is eternal.

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:48.120
So the first thing that comes to our mind is,

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:51.120
that whatever we do

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:58.120
before realisation we have not to do.

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:01.200
The first and foremost thing is

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:04.920
realisation comes to you effortlessly.

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:08.520
So the effort which is built into your body

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:11.000
all the time, the energy of effort,

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:12.840
"I must do this, I must do that,

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:14.920
I have to do this, I have to do that," -

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:18.960
that creates tension - that I have told you already.

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:24.200
So what do we do?

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:28.440
We do not try

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:35.520
to compete with others,

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:39.640
we do not try

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:49.840
to fix certain timing, dates, watches.

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:55.120
We do not also put our attention

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:59.000
into any endeavour

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:03.000
which puts us into effort.

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:08.120
But we relax that attitude of effort.

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:10.160
It's called in Sanskrit

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:12.120
as 'Prayatna Shaithilya'.

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:16.280
For a western mind it is very difficult to grasp the subject;

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.680
so try to understand.

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:22.680
That doesn't mean lethargy,

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:25.120
doesn't mean lethargy.

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:29.880
So you should never confuse with the dead,

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:33.400
the energy of the living.

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:39.760
Now we are trying to transform our energies

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:43.120
towards the energy of the Spirit.

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:49.080
So you have to allow the Spirit to take over.

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:53.120
Your effort of your mind

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:55.120
should be reduced

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:59.560
and the energy of the Spirit should work through you.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.120
Now how do you do it?

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:11.400
First is detachment.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.360
Detachment.

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:21.840
Detachment starts with the thought; let us see the thought.

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:26.480
It is called as 'Vichara Shaithilya', relaxation of the thought.

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:30.120
Now a thought is coming into your mind;

00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:33.120
some thought : "Today is Mother's puja let's go.

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:35.280
We have to hurry up, you see. We must get this.

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:36.880
You didn't get the flowers,

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:39.440
now you go to the 3rd world and get the flowers.

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:42.440
You must get this and you must get that".

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:48.320
Second is: "No, detach yourself.

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:53.360
Witness.

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:58.120
Leave it to the Spirit;

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:01.680
watch, you will get it."

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:04.800
Many of you have noticed this.

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:07.720
But still this mind which is quite silly

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:12.120
tries to impress upon you that

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:15.240
you have to use the old

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:19.200
junky instrument of this mind.

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:22.280
And it asserts, that "Better use."

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:25.200
And when you start using that,

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:28.920
ego comes in, you get attached to it,

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:33.120
and what you lose

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:38.280
is your progress - and thus the joy is minimised.

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:42.120
"How do you detach yourself ?"

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:46.120
For a person who is absolutely detached, it's very difficult

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:50.120
to explain "how to detach", isn't it?

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:52.240
I'll try!

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:57.280
Now. I cannot get attached, that the problem is.

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:04.080
And I find it difficult to explain

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:06.720
to you in words, which are human words,

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:10.120
but still, I'll try to say now.

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:17.920
Say, I tried something as human beings do, in the beginning,

00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:22.120
just to see how it works out - because I had to experiment.

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:24.760
For example, when I had to,

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:28.680
say, attend any puja or anything,

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:34.320
I used to ask them, 'what is the auspicious time ?'

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:39.840
So they would tell me, this is the auspicious time,

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:41.720
then another would telephone to say

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:43.400
"this is the auspicious time".

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:46.080
So I said, how can there be two auspicious times? You see.

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:47.920
It's a big problem with human beings.

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:52.240
So they said - there are 5 Panchangas in India;

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:57.120
means 5 books to consult the auspicious time.

00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:01.120
That's what human beings have done. I said, "Then why consult?

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:05.400
It's better not to have 5 auspicious times, isn't it?"

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:07.520
Then the auspicious time

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:12.680
has to be beyond time.

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:17.160
But it is bound in the time the way

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:19.240
human beings have made it,

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:23.720
so it is bound in the time. Like in India, it is so much, so much, so much,

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:26.600
but now, here it is different.

00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:29.000
Then you calculate, - you have a watch.

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:31.160
You see, to overcome all these hurdles

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:34.200
human beings also make certain devices.

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:38.640
So you consult. Now what is the auspicious time here?

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:45.000
Leave at that time. Then it's a big headache.

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:48.880
Because there are 5 books to be consulted,

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.040
watch could be wrong, this could be wrong, that could be so.

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:56.000
But if you are the Spirit,

00:13:56.120 --> 00:14:01.080
then the Spirit works out auspiciousness.

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:04.360
It's the Spirit that works out auspiciousness.

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:09.120
And imagine when you think like that, how much tension goes out.

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:12.200
First of all you have to be a slave of your watch;

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:15.000
another, you have to be a slave of the books;

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:19.280
then you have to be a slave of the market,

00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:24.920
of the room, of the place which you have to hire.

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:28.560
But supposing if you allow

00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:31.360
the Spirit to work it out,

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:36.960
then 'everything' will work out. And you will reach at this point when

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:39.640
it is the most auspicious.

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:42.320
So how do you accept it ? -

00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:45.800
Just by accepting.

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:50.120
So just now, if you give up

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:54.120
your 'satta', your own domain;

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:57.960
you get into the domain of your Spirit.

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:02.120
You give up 'your' domain,

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:04.920
that is, your ego's domain,

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:06.800
or may be your super-ego's domain,

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:10.040
you give up that and try

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:14.120
to see things how it works out.

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:17.560
Now, what is the testing point of it?

00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:23.320
How do you test it ? It works out -

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:30.120
that's the point of testing it. It works out.

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:36.120
Allow it to work out. Don't put your attention.

00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:40.200
Attention has the second part of is the tension.

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:44.040
And don't try to say, "Why not today,

00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:45.880
it should have happened today,

00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:48.120
we expected it to happen;

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:50.560
why not at 'this' moment ?" -

00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:53.440
That's your ego.

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:57.760
"Thy will be done".

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:02.200
So the thought

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:05.960
that starts moving

00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:10.200
in our mind all the time, which creates tensions

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:13.480
is not the thought of the Spirit.

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:17.640
So, what you should say, "Not this thought.

00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:22.400
Not this thought. /?/.

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:26.800
Not this thought, not this thought, not this thought", -

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:30.680
and see how you relax - Now you are relaxing. -

00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:34.000
'Not this thought, not this thought, ...

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:38.920
Just go on refusing accepting any thought.

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:41.160
So you go into Nirvichara.

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:45.960
In that state you feel the Spirit.

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:49.240
Christ has done the greatest work

00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:52.920
on this, I should say, but we do not understand because

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:58.240
His life was like a micro thing you see, in 3 years...

00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:03.120
So we have to open it out a little bit and see what He did.

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:07.840
He has given us the greatest weapon of "forgiveness".

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:14.120
When you forgive a person, what do you do?

00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:17.880
You accept the situation, to begin with.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.840
And secondly you forgive

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:27.320
what you think has been done wrong to you.

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:33.320
But because nothing can be done wrong to your Spirit,

00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:37.120
you just forgive, because you are the Spirit.

00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:41.120
And when you forgive,

00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:45.480
you have found that your tension goes away.

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:50.120
So even to your thoughts if you say, "Alright. Forgive this thought,

00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:51.560
forgive this thought," -

00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:55.360
because thought is also not to be punished.

00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:58.200
Forgive this thought, forgive this thought,

00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:00.280
forgive everything.

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:03.840
Not forget, - forgive;

00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:08.480
because then you will even forget that you are the Spirit!

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:13.920
But forgive

00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:16.080
"all the thoughts that are coming to me,"

00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:19.080
just go on saying. This is a mantra.

00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:23.160
What is a mantra? - Is that power

00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:28.520
of the word, that expresses Spirit.

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:34.080
So this is a very important thing Christ has given us:

00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:36.120
the weapon of forgiveness.

00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:38.600
Everybody has that weapon,

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:41.120
everyone can use that weapon.

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:44.600
You don't have to put in any effort for it.

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:47.120
You don't have to pay for it,

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:50.320
it is just that you have to say "I forgive."

00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:53.960
You'll be amazed your nerves will soothe down,

00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:57.080
this tension,

00:18:57.120 --> 00:19:03.280
this pressure of these modern things

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:08.520
will be reduced if you go on saying "I forgive", "I forgive them".

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:12.520
For example, you go and see,

00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:13.920
a some sort of a...

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:17.200
I mean if you happen suddenly to see something very filthy,

00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:20.880
according to the Spirit

00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:23.120
may be it is very exciting

00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:27.520
according to normal human beings, but we are abnormal people

00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:31.360
and for us if we find it rather ugly

00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:34.800
then - the best thing is to get over is "I forgive,

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:38.000
because they are ignorant, they are blind,

00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:40.440
they are not yet there where I am.

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:45.040
I am the one who is at the source of enjoyment,

00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:48.000
at the source of peace and while these are not.

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:51.160
So I forgive."

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:58.640
And you'll be amazed that this forgiveness that Christ gives you,

00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:07.080
works out Vichara Shaithilya, is the relaxation of the thought.

00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:17.040
Now this opposite movement that you have to move, first of all

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:23.120
should start at this point, today, from forgiving others.

00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:28.160
Now what happens when you forgive someone?

00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:30.920
That means you do not react.

00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:38.360
The power to react to somebody's injuries, insults

00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:42.400
is finished. And when that power is finished,

00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:45.440
you become a powerful person;

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:49.120
because nobody can now

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:57.760
overpower you; because nobody can kill you, nobody can hurt you,

00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:00.840
nobody can do anything to you.

00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:04.720
But it is not, again I'll say, shamelessness.

00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:09.120
You see people can think that it is shamelessness.

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:15.760
So if somebody says to you something harsh

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:22.160
and something that is wrong, you do not accept it.

00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:25.640
But supposing I shout at someone, the bhoots run away.

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:29.440
You have seen that many a times, I have to shout at people,

00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:31.480
so bhoots run away because they react,

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:37.400
and they just run away, but the Spirit shines through.

00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:42.720
So in Sahaja Yoga one has to understand that

00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:46.360
it is just this central path,

00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:49.480
is just the balancing thing which is important

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:52.960
it's not an extreme of anything.

00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:57.120
Like when we go to say that you must forgive everyone -

00:21:57.400 --> 00:22:00.640
is not going to that extreme

00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:02.920
where you have done some wrong,

00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:05.920
and somebody says to you, you don't take that part of it;

00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:07.760
it doesn't mean that.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:13.120
Again discretion is the engine of your movement.

00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:18.000
So you have to see that, "if they have said it,

00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:24.680
something like that, is it, have I gone against the Spirit?"

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.920
Otherwise, if I say to you something,

00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:29.920
you will say, "Alright, forgive Mother." -

00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:35.000
You see the point ! "Forgive Her for saying so". No.

00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:41.120
You cannot say that to me.

00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:48.600
So then, that is the point you start thinking,

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.800
"Why Mother said so? What have I done?"

00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:55.640
Now think on those lines; so you start moving again.

00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:58.480
It's a very

00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:02.120
thin road on which you have to walk.

00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:08.240
One side is the huge big Gibraltar,

00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:11.000
rock of Gibraltar of your ego,

00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:14.080
and another side is the super-ego.

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:19.280
In between is the small discretion path going,

00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:22.680
on which you have to see both the sides.

00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:26.920
Whether you are hitting yourself

00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:30.080
with the rock of Gibraltar, or you are falling into the

00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:33.200
valley of super-ego,

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:37.760
you should see that you are using your discretion.

00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:41.800
So, the another thing one has to remember

00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:46.320
is that whatever you were doing before realization, is to go to extremes.

00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:51.680
For example now, you start some sort of a movement.

00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:54.680
Say, you say we'll have classical things.

00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:59.160
Alright. Then you go so classical that it becomes mechanical.

00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:02.120
Now you say, "Give up; we'll start anticulture".

00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:05.600
So you'll go to the other side that you become primitive.

00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:07.880
Till you have reached the end of it

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:11.120
and learnt a lesson of your life, you do not return.

00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:14.680
But in Sahaja Yoga, it's a very slippery road

00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:16.760
on which we are walking.

00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:19.800
And there you have to see

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:23.320
that it is not your ego and it is not your super-ego.

00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:26.280
So discretion has to be used

00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:29.760
very much, and the balance, in this movement

00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:35.120
which we need not use otherwise,

00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:37.640
till we are absolutely destroyed

00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:41.200
we can go ahead with it, before realization.

00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:45.960
But in Sahaja Yoga as soon as you leave your discretion

00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:48.640
you fall this side or that side.

00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:54.120
Now those people who are of high quality

00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:57.440
Sahaja yogis take to discretion first:

00:24:57.600 --> 00:24:59.280
"How far to go?"

00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:04.120
Now for that Mother doesn't have to say because you are the Spirit.

00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:06.440
You yourself, you are the Spirit.

00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:09.280
First of all assume your position as the Spirit,

00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:11.520
and then you move with it,

00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:16.000
that you say discretely "how far to go,

00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:18.280
how far not to go."

00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:25.120
Now that is one of the things, that you have to become thoughtless,

00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:28.080
by becoming

00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:31.080
a forgiving person.

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:35.120
Most of the thoughts will drop out once you become forgiving.

00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:37.560
But you cannot forgive some people, like you

00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:40.640
cannot forgive God, you cannot forgive Mother.

00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:43.120
Certain things you cannot do,

00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:46.120
so the Maryadas must be seen.

00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:54.320
Now, in these boundaries if you walk properly, you can go ahead.

00:25:55.480 --> 00:26:00.120
This is the thing which brings you 'Vichara Shaithilya' or you can call

00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:04.840
the mind becomes relaxed.

00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:08.480
Then you have to have "Vishaya Shaithilya"

00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:11.120
means, your organs, sense organs

00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:13.200
always react to things,

00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:17.120
because you are human beings, you see, you are born like that.

00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:20.440
So whatever happens,

00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:23.240
you react.

00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:29.440
For example, you see a beautiful flower, you react.

00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:33.720
Some sort of a thought rises with it.

00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:38.240
Now you must practice

00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:43.320
to see something without allowing any thought to rise.

00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:46.800
Then you start sucking

00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:50.040
through your Spirit the beauty,

00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:51.920
the glory,

00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:56.120
the fragrance of a flower:

00:26:56.680 --> 00:27:00.600
Every flower is a poetry,

00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:05.120
but when you start thinking about it

00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:09.320
then it becomes a dead thing.

00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:11.960
But you just try to enjoy.

00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:15.040
Now you are the people who are

00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:19.200
on this earth to enjoy yourself,

00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:24.040
not to worry about anything, just enjoy.

00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:34.840
But if you are still used to,

00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:38.280
"I must do this thing special,

00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:40.800
I am something special Sahaja yogi,

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:46.560
I am a very highly evolved Sahaja yogi", then you are finished.

00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:52.480
Say, we are all going in a boat; enjoy the boat!

00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:56.280
And also the waves. But somebody says. "I am a very special one,

00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:58.800
I'll try to jump down,"

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:03.720
then you are back again

00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:06.120
into the same position.

00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:11.040
So one has to have an attitude of looking at things

00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:13.120
try to develop this habit

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:17.960
of looking at things without thinking about it.

00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:23.720
Try to develop your mind on those lines; that you do not react.

00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:27.280
Now the excitement business,

00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:32.400
or all this sensationalisation that is today's craze,

00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:36.560
comes from the same - that your sense organs

00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:41.200
require a kind of sensation because they react.

00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:44.480
While we must have our sense organs which do not react;

00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:49.880
because they must only react to the Spirit.

00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:53.960
So we have to develop a new type of sense organs

00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:58.320
or a new quality of sense organs

00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:04.120
who do not react to outside excitement.

00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:08.880
Now if you want Sahaja Yoga to be excitement, how can it be?

00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:12.560
I mean, just, it is just the opposite.

00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:18.880
So what you have to do is to

00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:23.800
see that your sense organs - say for example your eyes,

00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:29.120
they see something - then they react;

00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:34.720
your ears, they hear something - they react;

00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:42.400
somebody wants to talk and see the reaction.

00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:47.400
There are expectations.

00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:54.560
But because Spirit is active

00:29:54.960 --> 00:30:01.720
itself it acts itself, you have seen vibrations don't speak, they act.

00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:05.200
It has the power to act,

00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:08.560
you need not react.

00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:16.640
If you can reduce the power of reaction,

00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:20.320
you rise much higher.

00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:24.600
This is a thing which one has to know,

00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:29.800
when now we are celebrating His resurrection

00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:32.480
because it is Tapa,

00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:35.280
it is the penance of Christ.

00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:38.320
Christ came on this earth for penance.

00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:41.800
You know in the Gayatri mantra,

00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:44.400
there are 7 things they have said it,

00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:46.400
and at the point of Christ

00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:49.960
it is Tapa, is the penance.

00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:55.880
So you have to have the so-called penance to achieve the joy.

00:30:56.120 --> 00:31:00.800
The penance is to pull back

00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:04.280
your sense organs inside yourself. As Krishna has said

00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:06.640
that you have to pull back

00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:15.560
all your limbs of sense organs like a tortoise does.

00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:23.480
So the excitement that you require

00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:30.400
for your sense organs is no more needed,

00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:40.200
because your sense organs now, are themselves the source of excitement.

00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:48.280
In the sense that they neutralize all the excitements.

00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:55.560
You go to that point from where it starts.

00:31:57.280 --> 00:32:00.640
A river starts with a very small, little drop,

00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:04.400
and then it expands, expands, expands, expands.

00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:09.880
You go to the source. Absolutely to the central point.

00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:15.480
There you'll find hardly even a drop falling out.

00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:21.960
Another good example would be a wheel,

00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:24.200
it has the central point.

00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:28.400
And the wheel moves all the time but the central point has to be fixed,

00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:34.400
otherwise with the wheel that central point also moves,

00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:37.280
then the cart cannot move,

00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:39.720
the cart will also start rolling down.

00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:43.640
So the central point has to be fixed,

00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:46.200
otherwise the wheel cannot move.

00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:51.960
So you go to that central point, and the movement is on the central point,

00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:58.400
where there is no movement,

00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:05.040
in a way, because there is only ascent, there's no revolution,

00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:11.120
it doesn't revolve any more, there's just ascent on the central point.

00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:14.480
I hope you try to understand,

00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:18.400
that all the movements come out of ignorance.

00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:20.720
All the outer movements come

00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:25.400
because we are not yet on the central point.

00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:29.800
But that

00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:33.400
achievement is not difficult because you have jumped onto it -

00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:37.200
but you again come out onto the periphery,

00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:39.800
onto the wheel.

00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:42.720
So how to keep there,

00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:44.720
and to ascend in that, line.

00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:48.320
Say, for example, there are wheels - like this wheels after - wheels;

00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:54.720
but the central point is fixed. Now every time you jump out,

00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:58.280
now how do you go back to the central point? -

00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:07.200
is by detachment, by Tapa, by penance.

00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:12.400
Penance is "to deny."

00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:17.240
It doesn't mean asceticism of outside

00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:21.240
but asceticism of within.

00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:27.720
First of all we must learn to give.

00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:34.400
Give to others.

00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:39.320
That also sometimes people find it difficult, I have seen.

00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:41.640
Even to give one pound - they say -

00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:46.560
for Sahaja Yoga people find it difficult, I was amazed!

00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:55.200
So to give to others is going to be even worse.

00:34:55.400 --> 00:35:00.640
Try to give to others. Detachment.

00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:09.880
So one way is to have forgiveness,

00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:16.960
then second is generosity.

00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:26.120
If you work for Sahaja Yoga : "I haven't done anything so far".

00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:29.320
Not to react to it what work you have done.

00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:32.400
"Oh, it's a pleasure, I did it. It's my pleasure, I did it.

00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:34.400
Just out of pleasure".

00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:41.640
Don't count it; "I brought four flowers, she brought two flowers.

00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:46.400
I must be paid for one and a half flower."

00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:50.320
All these calculations are

00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:52.560
on the periphery, outside,

00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:53.960
when you were not realized souls.

00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:59.960
Now you just don't count anything else, but your blessings.

00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:03.400
So you be generous.

00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:10.400
I have seen now people have different attachments, subtler ones.

00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:15.200
Like attached to their own children I've seen people.

00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:17.640
Once their children are born to the Sahaja yogis

00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:21.560
then the whole world becomes their children:

00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:25.960
You spoil them, you spoil yourselves.

00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:32.800
You are just their trustees.

00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:36.360
But to you it becomes a very big

00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:38.280
thing that you have produced a child.

00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:39.800
Anybody can produce - even a dog

00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:41.720
produces a child, what is so great? -

00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:44.200
I mean, the bitch.

00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:50.400
That's a funny word to say!

00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:54.320
So, to create a child is not something great,

00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:59.400
but that you have a child in charge of you, which has to

00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:04.280
work for God.

00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:07.640
You are just in charge; but to identify that

00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:11.880
this child is great, it's a very big realized soul and

00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:15.280
all that, you see, will blast your head completely,

00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:20.480
because it's a subtler blasting. It's like hydrogen bomb.

00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:24.800
Ordinary bombs can destroy a part of it, but these subtler bombs

00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:26.280
are even worse.

00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:30.560
And this will spoil the child, that will spoil

00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:35.800
also you very much in your ascent.

00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:39.400
So what you have to do is to see that

00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:43.400
if you have a child, alright you are just in charge,

00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:50.040
as you are in charge of all, the children of Sahaja yogis

00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:53.480
not of your own. Be generous.

00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:56.560
/?/

00:37:56.640 --> 00:38:01.960
"The person who is a generous person. for him the whole world is his family."

00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:05.200
So expand yourself.

00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:07.880
This is my family, this is my wife,

00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:09.480
how can I live without my wife,

00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:13.040
or my husband my child; my -

00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:15.560
this will not help you.

00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:18.720
This will tie you down completely.

00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:25.200
This is a very subtler thing you start, because now you are receding back.

00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:26.960
First you gave up your family,

00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:29.200
gave up your children, gave up everything,

00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:31.200
came to this extreme; now you are going back.

00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:33.040
For Indians

00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:35.200
they understand that they are already too much in it,

00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:37.720
so they know that to detach yourself from your children is

00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:39.560
very important because they are already in it.

00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:43.800
They are too much attached to their children.

00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:46.480
In the beginning, they will always tell me, my child is like this,

00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:48.800
my mother is like this, my father is like this,

00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:52.400
my brother is like this, /?/ and they will be all bhoots,

00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:54.880
/?/ one better than the other.

00:38:55.640 --> 00:38:58.560
Without any discretion, bring all those relations on my head

00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:01.400
and I feel terrible about it.

00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:04.720
Even, a farfetched relation of a relation of a relation

00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:06.040
of a relation

00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:08.800
they will bring in along: "But you see she is my relation".

00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:12.040
So, in India it is very important that you are a relation

00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:13.720
of such and such person,

00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:16.280
and you may not have anything to do with that person.

00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:20.120
But he is a relation, so he is a relation.

00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:25.040
So, what we understand, is that

00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:30.800
our relationships and our identifications have to be dropped completely.

00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:36.960
We are universal beings now.

00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:41.480
So your child is a source of joy

00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:45.040
- every child should be the source of joy to you,

00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:47.120
every child should be.

00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:50.320
Bachelors that way are better or the ones who are not yet married,

00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:53.400
they can enjoy everybody's child nicely.

00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:57.720
But, when you are not a mother and a father,

00:39:57.880 --> 00:40:00.800
if you are enjoying, what is so creditable?

00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:05.400
When you become, the parents and then,

00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:07.480
you enjoy other children

00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:10.280
as much as you enjoy your child,

00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:12.880
then your generosity has started.

00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:17.640
So the generosity of loving others, the generosity

00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:20.720
through compassion.

00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:23.720
Compassion doesn't mean that you should pity someone but

00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:28.200
compassion means the sharing of

00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:33.560
personality, sharing of love personality.

00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:36.720
And that is where we miss the point,

00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:40.880
that compassion means that somebody has to be helped.

00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:43.400
Sahaja Yoga compassion is not that,

00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:47.280
Sahaja Yoga compassion is in sharing.

00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:51.960
Now the fourth thing you have to remember.

00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:57.280
What I've told you /?/: First is

00:40:57.400 --> 00:41:03.480
forgiveness first, according to me, is first is forgiveness

00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:08.040
second is

00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:11.800
you can call it, the compassion;

00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:13.720
or

00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:18.040
the detachment

00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:21.120
leading to compassion.

00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:29.640
So you can call it the first one as the forgiveness;

00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:34.800
detachment and thirdly the compassion.

00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:38.280
These are the

00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:46.400
wheels of your chariot which moves you. These are the wheels you should /?/.

00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:49.400
Now,

00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:58.720
if you go further with it,

00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:00.960
with the detachment,

00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:03.960
supposing works out in you,

00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:05.960
even you become compassionate.

00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:08.800
Even that comes.

00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:17.120
Still what is the judging point? How do you know that you are alright?

00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:25.120
How do you measure? How do you find out that you are alright?

00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:30.720
I mean what you call, take the bearing, as they say - of the ship.

00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:35.560
How do you know? - You must have peace.

00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:39.720
You should be a peaceful person.

00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:47.800
Agitation should be outside,

00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:53.880
but you should be absolutely peaceful person.

00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:57.720
If you are not a peaceful person then, be sure,

00:42:57.800 --> 00:43:01.640
that you are not yet there where you should have been.

00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:06.200
Now you can say that

00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:15.120
Christ also got very angry, he took a whip in His hand and beat the people,

00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:19.560
so we can also do the same. You are not Christ.

00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:24.800
You are not an incarnation, you must know, you are a realized soul.

00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:29.400
So you don't have to take a whip in your hand and hit others.

00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:32.880
You cannot. This is the mistake what

00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:35.400
the disciples of Mohammad Sahab have done,

00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:37.880
that they never thought, that He was an incarnation, you see.

00:43:37.960 --> 00:43:41.200
All the incarnations have killed.

00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:44.400
Krishna has killed, Rama has killed,

00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:49.720
the Devi has killed. But you are not the Devi,

00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:56.120
you are not Shri Krishna. So you don't have to kill anyone.

00:43:56.320 --> 00:43:58.960
You don't have to show the temper.

00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:01.400
So if you still have a temper

00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:04.720
then know that your progress is very slow.

00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:07.480
You have to be a peaceful person.

00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:11.640
Imagine Sahaja yogis having a Jehad'. What do you say to that!

00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:18.400
Going with swords in the hand and spears in the hand and hitting others.

00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:24.960
This point I want to make very clear, because

00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:27.480
when I am there, of course, I am going to

00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:31.880
tell you everyone, but when I am not there I don't want you to take

00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:36.880
in your hands the swords and things and fight.

00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:44.960
What William Blake has written is for the incarnation.

00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:48.400
The Incarnations say "Give me my...."

00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:53.320
It's not that you should say now "Give me

00:44:53.720 --> 00:44:58.400
Rama's Ayudhas" - You cannot use. You are not an incarnation.

00:44:58.480 --> 00:45:07.400
Because the discretion of these are effective, yours, are not.

00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:14.960
So you are not to take any, weapon into your hand -

00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:18.400
or even anger.

00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:23.200
Doesn't behave a Sahaja yogi at any point -

00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:26.720
unless and until I tell you to be angry.

00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:34.800
So this is the criteria, that you have to be peaceful person,

00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:37.400
not aggressive person.

00:45:39.720 --> 00:45:43.560
Now different people have different type of aggressiveness.

00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:50.200
For example, men don't discuss, you see, they just slap you - finished.

00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:51.280
They don't argue

00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:53.320
they don't like to argue, at a point they will go and they'll just

00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:55.120
hit you out and finished.

00:45:55.280 --> 00:45:58.400
But women are very good at argument -

00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:03.720
and very, aggressive. Very aggressively argumentative.

00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:08.280
"So you don't argue" is the second point.

00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:11.400
If you are argumentative then know that you

00:46:11.480 --> 00:46:15.280
are not yet there where you have to be.

00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:20.560
A peaceful person goes to a point and then argues it out.

00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:22.880
If you are argumentative, then

00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:26.080
your progress is not alright.

00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:35.720
So a person has to be absolutely peaceful

00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:40.400
and this peace is the most effective thing.

00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:45.200
We are seeking the peace of the universe.

00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:50.400
You cannot achieve it through any one of these bombs.

00:46:51.120 --> 00:46:54.560
You can only achieve it through the Spirit,

00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:57.880
which is the source of all the peace.

00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:03.640
So, I would request all of you

00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:06.720
to give up tempers, angers.

00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:12.720
Peace is the greatest powerful, thing on this earth.

00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:15.800
There is a story. A Chinese story interesting about it.

00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:22.400
There were two very great fighting cocks,

00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:25.040
known to be the greatest of all. And they have this,

00:47:25.120 --> 00:47:29.400
you see excitement again of the cock - fighting in China.

00:47:29.480 --> 00:47:34.120
I mean you can have everything in this world, all absurd things,

00:47:34.280 --> 00:47:38.720
like rugby, football, this, that, I mean there's no end to it.

00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:44.400
So these two cocks

00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:50.040
were to go in for an international sort of a fight, I think.

00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:53.400
So they said there is one great saint living here, he makes

00:47:53.480 --> 00:47:55.120
everyone very powerful.

00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:58.720
So the owner of the cocks went to him and he said,

00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:01.560
"Will you make my these two cocks very

00:48:01.720 --> 00:48:07.120
powerful, so that they can fight and win?"

00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:11.640
He said "Alright, it's very simple. Alright, you leave them to me."

00:48:13.400 --> 00:48:16.560
So after a month when he appeared to take the cocks,

00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:20.560
they would not react to anything, they were just standing like this.

00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:24.400
He got a fright of his life! He said, 'How are they going to fight?"

00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:27.280
He, said "You just take them, you'll see."

00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:32.880
So he took them to the arena and put them there.

00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:35.400
And all the cocks, you see,

00:48:35.400 --> 00:48:40.200
invaded each other, fought, and these were just watching this to very much.

00:48:41.720 --> 00:48:43.400
And all the rest of them

00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:48.200
got so frightened with these two, they all ran away and they won !

00:48:50.640 --> 00:48:53.640
So the person who is peaceful

00:48:56.400 --> 00:48:59.400
is the powerful  - the one who doesn't react to anything else,

00:48:59.480 --> 00:49:01.960
is the most powerful.

00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:09.720
So, one has to understand

00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:14.400
that peace is the criteria to know that

00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:21.400
you are absolutely at that point where you have to be.

00:49:21.480 --> 00:49:25.120
But peace by no, chance means cowardliness.

00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:28.880
Because, you see, I know what indiscretion is, human indiscretion.

00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:33.040
They think it's cowardliness. No. You stand like this,

00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:40.280
not like this. The difference between a peaceful person and a cowardly person is

00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:44.880
that a cowardly person acts to the negative forces,

00:49:45.400 --> 00:49:50.640
and a peaceful person creates positive forces, constructive forces,

00:49:50.720 --> 00:49:53.400
generates it.

00:49:58.200 --> 00:50:01.560
So you are not to be cowardly, but you have to be peaceful.

00:50:01.720 --> 00:50:07.960
And a peaceful person is like a magnet, you see, so soothing, it is.

00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:11.400
So you can see we are moving towards

00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:15.200
the soothing qualities of the Spirit.

00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:20.400
You have to soothe, others and not to excite, but to soothe.

00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:26.880
And that soothing quality what you call, is -

00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:31.800
we call it like the ghee.

00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:38.400
When your body is charred and is absolutely burning,

00:50:38.400 --> 00:50:43.040
then you put some sort of a ghee, on it

00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:47.480
so it becomes smooth.

00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:51.400
Like lubrication - lubricant.

00:50:51.640 --> 00:50:56.120
Such a personality is a lubricant.

00:50:56.720 --> 00:51:03.960
It doesn't go into friction, but reduces, frictions.

00:51:04.120 --> 00:51:07.120
It is a lubricant temperament.

00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:09.880
So you should judge yourself,

00:51:10.040 --> 00:51:11.400
"Am I a lubricant personality?"

00:51:11.400 --> 00:51:16.960
For example, you see two persons are fighting, alright?

00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:21.400
And one goes as a peace-maker;

00:51:21.800 --> 00:51:23.520
and one goes to excite it more

00:51:23.640 --> 00:51:25.960
you see, he joins them.

00:51:26.120 --> 00:51:29.000
Now the one who is the peacemaker is the blessed one,

00:51:29.080 --> 00:51:34.400
is the one who is the one moving towards God,

00:51:34.560 --> 00:51:37.960
because he is the peacemaker.

00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:42.400
"Blessed are those who are the peacemakers."

00:51:42.640 --> 00:51:45.200
All these things if you see are...what I am

00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:48.800
telling today is the same, - but in a different language, that's all -

00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:50.400
what Christ said it.

00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:53.280
To understand Christ you have to open Him out more, because

00:51:53.400 --> 00:51:55.800
He said it in very simple words,

00:51:55.960 --> 00:51:57.880
which has very deep meanings

00:51:57.960 --> 00:52:01.400
and only a Sahaja yogi can understand Him.

00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:06.960
So you have to make peace.

00:52:07.960 --> 00:52:12.000
I have seen people been given Nobel prizes of peace,

00:52:12.120 --> 00:52:13.960
who have no peace within them at all,

00:52:14.120 --> 00:52:16.520
they are hot-tempered, horrible people and given

00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:19.920
Nobel prize for peace! Alright!

00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:26.200
And personified temper, absolutely hot-tempered;

00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:29.480
and you call it peace! How can you have peace with a person

00:52:29.560 --> 00:52:32.400
who is so hot tempered.

00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:34.560
So this is possible. In this

00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:37.960
human endeavour anything is possible, you see.

00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:41.560
It's sometimes so absurd, you see,

00:52:41.720 --> 00:52:46.720
like I have seen people getting a degree

00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:48.720
"doctorate of learning",

00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:53.400
who hasn't even been to a school who does not know how to read the books.

00:52:54.120 --> 00:52:55.400
Anything is possible.

00:52:55.480 --> 00:53:01.400
Because it is just a manoeuvring of everything, its so artificial.

00:53:05.480 --> 00:53:16.880
So the lubrication of your love, the love.

00:53:17.640 --> 00:53:21.400
So the love that you enjoy is not what is bestowed upon you,

00:53:21.400 --> 00:53:24.400
but what you bestow upon others.

00:53:25.720 --> 00:53:29.200
The idea of love is also funny.

00:53:29.400 --> 00:53:34.040
It's just the opposite of what you have seen so far.

00:53:35.880 --> 00:53:39.200
They'll write "I-love-you" alright

00:53:39.320 --> 00:53:43.960
and the second sentence will be "I want to divorce you."

00:53:45.400 --> 00:53:47.800
And the modern fashion is like that.

00:53:47.960 --> 00:53:52.400
"I love you; I want to divorce you because I love you too much!

00:53:59.200 --> 00:54:02.640
Because I want to spare you." -

00:54:03.400 --> 00:54:08.320
is very modern, very sophisticated.

00:54:10.960 --> 00:54:16.560
So the love that hurts others, love that tortures others

00:54:17.640 --> 00:54:21.400
the love that expects, is not love.

00:54:21.880 --> 00:54:29.320
Love that just flows, just forgives, it is just compassion.

00:54:29.400 --> 00:54:33.280
It's the most, enjoyable thing.

00:54:33.560 --> 00:54:37.280
Radiant, just like the sun-shine.

00:54:37.400 --> 00:54:42.120
Like Christ who even forgave those who crucified Him!

00:54:42.280 --> 00:54:47.200
Imagine! Imagine !!

00:54:50.080 --> 00:54:52.560
Because He knew that God will not forgive.

00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:55.040
Even God would not forgive those.

00:54:55.120 --> 00:54:58.400
He tried to forgive them.

00:55:02.200 --> 00:55:07.720
But we - those who call themselves Christians - those who are

00:55:07.880 --> 00:55:10.320
supposed to be Christians are just the opposite of Christ.

00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:14.800
Just, the opposite; in every, way, if you see.

00:55:15.120 --> 00:55:17.400
Just the opposite.

00:55:18.280 --> 00:55:24.400
So, you come to a point where you understand that you become the Love.

00:55:25.640 --> 00:55:30.040
And when it is pure, love relationship,

00:55:30.320 --> 00:55:32.480
when there is no lust and greed, or

00:55:32.720 --> 00:55:37.120
anything but, just love and purity of it,

00:55:37.400 --> 00:55:40.720
you don't want to do it

00:55:40.960 --> 00:55:47.280
because you want to have any lust out of that person.

00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:54.400
Just see the opposite. Here the girl is very attractive.

00:55:54.560 --> 00:55:59.400
What is so attractive? To my eyes they just look like mosquitoes;

00:55:59.560 --> 00:56:03.200
horrible - sometimes like witches you know.

00:56:03.320 --> 00:56:07.040
Their nails and all that look to me like witches - so artificial.

00:56:07.480 --> 00:56:10.560
Just like machines, sometimes.

00:56:10.720 --> 00:56:15.880
What is so attractive in these women? Or in these men you see.

00:56:16.200 --> 00:56:20.280
They look like skulls to me, sometimes and somethings like,

00:56:20.400 --> 00:56:24.960
Frankenstein, I don't know what they look like, horrible.

00:56:25.040 --> 00:56:28.560
The way they walk, the way they try to impress, I mean nothing but

00:56:28.720 --> 00:56:30.560
fear comes out of them.

00:56:30.720 --> 00:56:35.800
So, what you emit out of your love to others:

00:56:35.960 --> 00:56:40.040
a sense of security, an ocean, of security.

00:56:42.720 --> 00:56:47.560
Everyone feels secured; secured with you.

00:56:48.400 --> 00:56:55.120
And that security will be felt by you.

00:56:56.320 --> 00:57:03.720
Trust. Trust others. You must trust. That is very important.

00:57:04.040 --> 00:57:06.560
Trust for everything. I have seen some people

00:57:06.640 --> 00:57:08.800
are very serious on money,

00:57:09.120 --> 00:57:11.480
some are very serious about possessions,

00:57:11.880 --> 00:57:15.040
some are this - I know they...

00:57:15.280 --> 00:57:18.320
they are sometimes weak people.

00:57:20.040 --> 00:57:23.280
Could be weak about money, could be weak about possessions,

00:57:23.400 --> 00:57:27.480
could be even insulting to things, that should not be so.

00:57:27.640 --> 00:57:34.320
But don't lose your temper, just have forgiveness for them,

00:57:35.200 --> 00:57:37.960
and let them feel secured.

00:57:38.480 --> 00:57:42.040
Absolutely secured. Trust. You see

00:57:42.120 --> 00:57:46.040
as you know that I never ask the trustees to give me any reports.

00:57:46.200 --> 00:57:51.320
I do not want them to give me any accounts or anything;

00:57:51.400 --> 00:57:53.880
I don't understand accounts at all myself, you see.

00:57:54.200 --> 00:57:57.480
So I never see how many accounts you have got, what money you have got

00:57:57.800 --> 00:57:59.480
or, say, suppose Gavin is saying that

00:57:59.640 --> 00:58:03.040
"I am sending money now Mother to you, whatever I received." It's alright -

00:58:03.400 --> 00:58:05.480
finished. I don't know whether he is giving receipts or not,

00:58:05.560 --> 00:58:08.320
nothing. If he says so, alright; I leave it to him.

00:58:08.480 --> 00:58:11.800
He has to grow, whatever it is. It's his responsibility,

00:58:12.120 --> 00:58:14.400
if he's not grown up enough he will grow.

00:58:14.480 --> 00:58:16.400
So trust others, because in

00:58:16.480 --> 00:58:20.560
Sahaja Yoga you must know we are all growing, we are all transforming.

00:58:20.800 --> 00:58:25.200
So we must, grow, we must, grow; and for your growth

00:58:25.400 --> 00:58:28.720
security is the most, important thing.

00:58:29.400 --> 00:58:34.400
If there is no security for a tree, it will never, grow.

00:58:34.400 --> 00:58:36.920
So everybody should feel secured

00:58:37.040 --> 00:58:40.560
in the company of Sahaja yogis.

00:58:42.200 --> 00:58:45.560
If there is any insecurity from someone,

00:58:45.640 --> 00:58:49.400
then it should be reported to the collective,

00:58:49.480 --> 00:58:54.200
and should see that all such cases of insecurity - creating,

00:58:54.400 --> 00:58:59.560
troublecreators should be a little bit taken out, for the time being.

00:58:59.720 --> 00:59:01.720
Because there should be a healthy growth.

00:59:01.880 --> 00:59:06.120
But growth must take place and for that you must trust.

00:59:06.320 --> 00:59:08.560
Somebody might make mistakes; alright, doesn't matter.

00:59:08.720 --> 00:59:10.720
Somebody may be dishonest, doesn't matter.

00:59:10.960 --> 00:59:13.800
But give them security.

00:59:16.200 --> 00:59:18.720
But what we do is to give security to bhoots,

00:59:18.840 --> 00:59:20.400
I've seen - very common.

00:59:20.400 --> 00:59:24.480
People will have only interest in the bhootish people,

00:59:25.400 --> 00:59:29.040
they will trust a bhootish people than to trust a person who is a little dishonest,

00:59:29.120 --> 00:59:31.400
does not matter. You see what is dishonesty?

00:59:31.640 --> 00:59:34.040
Supposing somebody doesn't give income tax, doesn't matter,

00:59:34.120 --> 00:59:37.560
it's this Government, or that Government what does it matter to us?

00:59:37.640 --> 00:59:42.120
As long as that person is honest to God it's sufficient.

00:59:42.320 --> 00:59:44.560
Our honesty is of a different level.

00:59:44.720 --> 00:59:49.880
So we become angry with that person, we get upset with that person.

00:59:50.040 --> 00:59:52.040
There's nothing to get angry.

00:59:52.120 --> 00:59:54.560
Actually my system as you know is

00:59:54.680 --> 00:59:58.320
that I know also the people, who have mismanaged money who've

00:59:58.560 --> 01:00:02.400
not been alright, I know it somehow, without knowing accounts,

01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:05.640
but I said "just forgive, forgive, forgive". I know everything

01:00:05.880 --> 01:00:09.480
but I just say "forgive, doesn't matter."

01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:12.720
Then, you might say with rationality, that

01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:15.720
"Mother, such a person will go ahead with it". No, he wouldn't,

01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:18.400
you try and trust.

01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:23.040
Why? - because they are growing,

01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:26.480
they are coming to light and the more light they see,

01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:31.800
the better they become. This trust has to be there.

01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:39.280
Trusting in God that He will give him the right path.

01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:48.120
So this understanding about your growth

01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:54.640
is within yourself, which you can see.

01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:58.800
And the highest of all is the collectivity,

01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:02.640
not the fraternity of bhoots, but collectivity.

01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:10.480
Again discretion has to be used, how far you are collective.

01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:13.800
If a person thinks he is a very great person

01:01:13.880 --> 01:01:16.880
and he can correct everyone, and he can punish everyone

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:20.800
and he can do as he likes, than he is not collective.

01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:23.640
But sometimes you have to also

01:01:23.800 --> 01:01:29.200
understand that even with bhootish people I have to stoop down to conquer them,

01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:31.400
to bring them round.

01:01:33.720 --> 01:01:38.320
Don't become like them; try to elevate them

01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:41.400
than to go down to their level.

01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:46.040
And if you can manage that, then you have achieved

01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:50.400
what you wanted to do through your collectivity.

01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:55.400
And a person has to be collective. If he is not collective

01:01:55.400 --> 01:02:01.400
then one must know that there is something definitely wrong with that person.

01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:11.120
Then, what you have to do after detachment from things -

01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:16.720
the penance part of it. For this we have to be

01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:20.960
doing some penance. For example, you are too much attached to any thing;

01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:25.120
say you are very fond of food. Many people are, I know that:

01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:27.200
the tongue is the worst of all.

01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:33.200
If you can control tongue then you have control over 50% of your sense organs.

01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:35.120
If you are attached to the tongue.

01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:37.960
These days I am going into a big penance, I am eating just

01:02:38.040 --> 01:02:41.880
boiled food without salt without any thing in it, just boiled food.

01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:48.320
Going into penance. I have to, for 9 months.

01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:49.720
For me it doesn't matter.

01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:53.800
It is no penance for me because I've no tongue at all.

01:02:53.960 --> 01:02:57.040
No taste buds. I can manage.

01:02:57.320 --> 01:02:59.200
So whatever you like too much,

01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:01.960
"Ahaa! I love to have something...," you see. Especially

01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:05.880
here I've seen if you see good food or anything - "Mmmm....."

01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:13.960
Now, it's as cold as ice, should I have it.

01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:16.080
I can, if you want

01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:20.160
but it's rather cool. Ithink you would to give me hot alright.

01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:22.400
I don't mind having it.

01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:28.200
Alright. So now what you have to do, is to have

01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:36.120
a kind of self-directed discipline.

01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:39.560
Self-directed, not on others.

01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:42.880
Self-directed.

01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:46.480
"Do I meditate in the morning?

01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:49.280
I don't. So what's wrong with me?

01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:52.120
I'm supposed to be a Sahaja yogi."

01:03:54.960 --> 01:04:00.640
Nobody has to tell you, you yourself should do this to yourself.

01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:04.400
You are fond of food, "Alright doesn't matter, I'll fast for two days".

01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:06.880
No fasting is allowed in Sahaja Yoga, alright;

01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:09.720
but fasting for detachment is alright.

01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:13.400
Not for God's Sake, but for your sake you do it.

01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:18.880
"I like a particular type of cake. Alright I'll not have it.

01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:20.480
I'll not have it for one year".

01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:24.720
But no, when people have to give up, they give up something like rhubarb!

01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:36.120
So one should not be cunning about it,

01:04:36.200 --> 01:04:38.560
you should not be cunning with yourself.

01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:43.640
So what you have to do is to see that where does this mind go?

01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:45.480
What is the attraction?

01:04:45.640 --> 01:04:49.400
I mean, even now I find some people are like Romeo and Juliets,

01:04:49.480 --> 01:04:53.560
you see, still living in that area of Romeo-Julietness. Get out of it!

01:04:54.200 --> 01:04:56.280
Nonsense.

01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:02.120
Get out of that kind of a thing.

01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:04.640
That doesn't mean you become a dry personality.

01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:06.800
Another extreme can be that

01:05:06.920 --> 01:05:09.480
you just become like sticks, that's not the point.

01:05:09.640 --> 01:05:15.320
But you should not indulge into these things.

01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:18.960
These are all artificial things.

01:05:19.400 --> 01:05:23.480
So a 'tapa' is to be established within yourself.

01:05:23.720 --> 01:05:27.400
Self-discipline. Now those who talk too much should stop talking.

01:05:27.480 --> 01:05:29.640
Absolutely mauna is the ilaj.

01:05:29.880 --> 01:05:34.400
Mauna is the treatment for such people! Just don't talk!

01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:37.800
Those who do not talk,

01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:41.120
most of the English men do not talk, women talk too much.

01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:43.280
It's a fact. I've seen -

01:05:43.400 --> 01:05:46.480
any interview you see, the women will talk first.

01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:49.040
This constable lady died; her mother was talking.

01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:51.960
In India the mother would not be in a position to talk, you know.

01:05:52.040 --> 01:05:53.880
The father was sitting quiet.

01:05:54.120 --> 01:05:58.120
You just can't imagine. In India supposing a child dies like that, you see,

01:05:58.200 --> 01:06:01.320
the mother would be absolutely sobbing, in a mess.

01:06:01.400 --> 01:06:04.400
She won't be talking. Here the woman was talking, we were most surprised!

01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:07.640
You see. The women talk too much

01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:11.480
the men just don't they are not supposed to talk I think,

01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:14.040
they just keep quiet.

01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:17.480
At the most they might be slapping. I don't know what they do.

01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:23.400
So what we have to do is to teach ourselves,

01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:28.400
that if our tongue talks too much then we'd better keep quiet.

01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:32.400
If we do not talk, we better talk.

01:06:32.480 --> 01:06:35.480
We should teach ourselves how to talk. Now go and talk to the sea,

01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:37.040
go and talk to some tree,

01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:40.640
go and talk to someone like that. Or best is to talk to me,

01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:47.120
to my photograph, so that's how you achieve

01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:50.400
a kind of control over your tongue.

01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:53.120
To talk sweetly.

01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:56.040
Some people have to go through penance for that.

01:06:56.120 --> 01:07:01.200
For them to talk sweetly is like

01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:03.960
taking rubab again.

01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:08.560
They just can't talk sweetly, just can't. Sarcasm.

01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:16.200
You see in that sarcasm, they have a special pleasure.

01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:20.400
Try to say something sweet.

01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:23.400
You can be humorous without being sarcastic.

01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:27.480
Humour is the best way. What is the need to be sarcastic?

01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:31.480
There's no need at all, it's a sign of cowardliness, I think, sarcasm.

01:07:31.640 --> 01:07:35.960
It is a sign that you want to hurt others, but you are not straight forward.

01:07:36.200 --> 01:07:39.200
So try to avoid sarcastic talking.

01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:43.800
If you are sarcastic, better tell your tongue to behave yourself.

01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:47.880
So a little disciplining towards yourself,

01:07:47.960 --> 01:07:53.040
punishment what you call, or the tapa - the penance has to work out.

01:07:53.720 --> 01:07:56.560
Now people have so many ways of

01:07:56.720 --> 01:07:59.960
seeing things. Some men want to see women all the time,

01:08:00.120 --> 01:08:02.400
some women want to see men all the time,

01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:04.880
or clothes, or anything, you see.

01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:07.200
Now, the difference is that

01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:10.400
when you see something, it reacts.

01:08:10.640 --> 01:08:13.800
The difference between my

01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:17.960
looking at any thing is that, that reacts.

01:08:21.880 --> 01:08:25.720
When I look at you, your Kundalini reacts, when I look at this,

01:08:25.960 --> 01:08:29.640
it gets vibrated. Kataksha, - Kataksha:

01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:39.400
Every glance; every glance

01:08:40.960 --> 01:08:46.720
makes the thing react and Nireekshana means, I know what it is.

01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:50.280
I know what it is. Just looking at a person I know what it is.

01:08:50.400 --> 01:08:54.280
Looking at a thing, I know what it is. - Nireekshana.

01:08:54.400 --> 01:08:56.720
But the whole thing is in the memory there, you see.

01:08:57.280 --> 01:09:00.800
Like we were going and they said we have only black stones.

01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:03.480
I said, "No, you have red also." He said, "Where? Do you know?"

01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:06.000
So I told them the exact spot where to get the red stones.

01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:07.440
He said, "How do you know, Mother?"

01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:08.960
I said, "We passed that way

01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:11.560
about eight years back and I know there are red stones."

01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:14.200
So everything I see

01:09:14.320 --> 01:09:18.800
gets vibrated and also I note

01:09:18.960 --> 01:09:23.400
what is there, and is all ready there

01:09:23.400 --> 01:09:26.560
to be used at the proper time.

01:09:27.720 --> 01:09:34.880
But what do I do? What do I do? I do nothing

01:09:37.400 --> 01:09:41.400
I do nothing. I don't think, I don't plan.

01:09:41.400 --> 01:09:44.400
Everything that you do, I don't do.

01:09:48.720 --> 01:09:55.640
So when you have that kind of a temperament you will be amazed!

01:09:57.400 --> 01:10:01.200
The amount of dynamism that will work it out.

01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:05.400
You don't have to create a dynamo, it is inside you.

01:10:05.400 --> 01:10:08.320
Let it work out.

01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:12.640
Today I had told Gavin that I won't have so much of a puja but I will talk.

01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:16.720
Because puja is alright, it talks for itself, and this thing.

01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:20.280
But I wanted to talk to you because now the time has come

01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:21.880
for us to go further.

01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:25.200
As a result of all this,

01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:29.760
all this and that what you do, you become the truth.

01:10:29.880 --> 01:10:32.520
You become the truth.

01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:38.800
So, in every chakra if you concentrate,

01:10:38.880 --> 01:10:44.480
and use the chakra to detach yourself from the particular

01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:47.320
quality of that chakra.

01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:52.400
Like, now for example, the Nabhi chakra does the digestion.

01:10:53.400 --> 01:10:58.720
Now you don't worry what you should eat to digest.

01:10:59.040 --> 01:11:00.960
Just detach yourself from there,

01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:05.320
with vibrations if you just see and eat; whatever is there,

01:11:05.480 --> 01:11:08.040
you will digest.

01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:15.400
And then you become the truth. Truth that is love, that is God.

01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:18.720
May God Bless you all.
