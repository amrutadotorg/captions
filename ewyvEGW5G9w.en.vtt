00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:15.646
Today we have come here

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:21.604
to worship Jesus Christ and His Mother.

00:01:24.146 --> 00:01:26.562
It's such a coincidence

00:01:26.562 --> 00:01:28.854
that the Mother of Christ

00:01:28.854 --> 00:01:31.562
came and stayed in Turkey.

00:01:32.271 --> 00:01:34.729
Isn't it surprising

00:01:34.771 --> 00:01:36.729
that She should come here

00:01:37.938 --> 00:01:42.437
after the crucifixion of Christ and stayed here.

00:01:42.854 --> 00:01:47.355
I wonder if He also came with Her later on?

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.105
But they say then He went to Kashmir

00:01:50.313 --> 00:01:52.230
and She was also there.

00:01:52.813 --> 00:01:55.479
Quite possible, on their way

00:01:55.646 --> 00:01:57.896
they might have gone there.

00:01:58.562 --> 00:02:04.230
So we are here to worship Him.

00:02:13.105 --> 00:02:14.646
According to Sahaja Yoga,

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.938
She was the incarnation of Mahalakshmi

00:02:20.687 --> 00:02:25.230
and She's the one who sacrificed Her Son

00:02:25.687 --> 00:02:30.646
for the sake of religion.

00:02:31.771 --> 00:02:34.646
But unfortunately,

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:37.355
nobody understood Her value.

00:02:39.521 --> 00:02:41.437
Nobody saw

00:02:41.562 --> 00:02:46.771
that She was such a great spiritual personality.

00:02:47.271 --> 00:02:49.521
Only through Sahaja Yoga

00:02:50.021 --> 00:02:52.188
you can understand that She was

00:02:52.437 --> 00:02:55.230
a very great personality

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:59.521
who gave birth to Christ.

00:03:05.105 --> 00:03:09.355
It is very unfortunate

00:03:10.771 --> 00:03:12.813
that She was not respected,

00:03:14.146 --> 00:03:17.562
specially in the Islamic world.

00:03:18.271 --> 00:03:19.479
Because of that,

00:03:20.355 --> 00:03:26.854
the women in the Islamic culture have no place.

00:03:29.063 --> 00:03:33.646
My experience is very sad about them.

00:03:35.854 --> 00:03:38.146
We have started an organization

00:03:39.313 --> 00:03:41.646
for the rehabilitation of women

00:03:42.188 --> 00:03:45.813
who are destitutes and all of them

00:03:46.146 --> 00:03:50.604
who have applied are Muslim ladies - very sad.

00:03:52.355 --> 00:03:54.271
While Muhammed Sahib has said

00:03:54.271 --> 00:03:57.355
that "you must look after your mother"

00:03:58.105 --> 00:04:00.646
despite that all these women

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:06.146
some of them have eight children, ten children

00:04:06.437 --> 00:04:09.188
- have come to this destitute home.

00:04:10.105 --> 00:04:13.146
Of course, we have to give them place.

00:04:13.188 --> 00:04:15.729
We have to look after them

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:18.063
because we don't believe in all these

00:04:18.355 --> 00:04:23.146
small type of ideas about religion.

00:04:24.146 --> 00:04:27.063
Most important is 'human' religion.

00:04:29.105 --> 00:04:32.188
We have to combine all these religions together.

00:04:33.146 --> 00:04:35.729
It's a terrible task

00:04:36.355 --> 00:04:40.562
because Muslim won't respect Muslim.

00:04:40.896 --> 00:04:44.021
Christians - Christians won't respect Hindus.

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:46.687
I mean it's a funny thing that's going on.

00:04:48.105 --> 00:04:49.979
They all are for God

00:04:50.813 --> 00:04:53.313
and for God's work and His love.

00:04:54.437 --> 00:04:57.021
Despite that, there's no respect.

00:04:57.813 --> 00:04:58.854
There's no love.

00:05:00.105 --> 00:05:02.562
On the contrary, they're all quarrelling, fighting,

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:06.521
killing everywhere.

00:05:08.021 --> 00:05:09.063
It's very sad

00:05:10.271 --> 00:05:13.146
that in the name of religion and God,

00:05:13.437 --> 00:05:17.729
people should become so cruel and so absurd.

00:05:19.854 --> 00:05:21.188
This is the only solution-

00:05:23.146 --> 00:05:25.355
is to give them Self Realization,

00:05:26.854 --> 00:05:30.687
which is the Realization

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:36.687
was called as miraj in the Koran.

00:05:36.896 --> 00:05:39.105
It's called as miraj.

00:05:39.146 --> 00:05:42.646
But they have said that nobody can get miraj.

00:05:44.021 --> 00:05:46.646
Muhammed-sahib got it, but nobody else

00:05:47.105 --> 00:05:49.355
- like they have banned people

00:05:49.604 --> 00:05:51.479
from getting Self Realization,

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:53.063
which is not true.

00:05:54.105 --> 00:05:58.396
All human beings can get Self Realization.

00:05:59.646 --> 00:06:03.562
Whether they are from Africa,

00:06:04.355 --> 00:06:07.813
England, America, India, anywhere.

00:06:09.188 --> 00:06:11.188
They all can get their miraj.

00:06:12.938 --> 00:06:16.521
One should understand that no human being

00:06:16.854 --> 00:06:19.355
is created in this world to fight,

00:06:19.813 --> 00:06:21.271
to fight each other.

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:24.230
Even the animals don't fight.

00:06:25.146 --> 00:06:27.021
Why should human beings fight

00:06:27.313 --> 00:06:29.105
- that, too, in the name of religion.

00:06:29.521 --> 00:06:30.938
In the name of God,

00:06:33.396 --> 00:06:35.188
Christ came on this Earth

00:06:35.521 --> 00:06:37.562
just to create oneness of religion,

00:06:38.479 --> 00:06:42.355
but even the Christians, they only started fighting,

00:06:43.146 --> 00:06:44.646
dominating others.

00:06:45.271 --> 00:06:48.271
It's a big world of turmoil,

00:06:48.896 --> 00:06:53.146
where everybody is fighting in the name of God

00:06:53.355 --> 00:06:56.021
and in the name of religion.

00:06:57.271 --> 00:06:59.687
So our religion is global,

00:07:00.729 --> 00:07:02.105
is one religion.

00:07:02.771 --> 00:07:04.979
We respect all the Deities,

00:07:06.521 --> 00:07:08.521
all the Gods and Goddesses

00:07:09.687 --> 00:07:13.021
- respect Them and worship Them.

00:07:13.938 --> 00:07:17.687
We are not so stupid

00:07:18.813 --> 00:07:22.230
not to understand that They are all one.

00:07:23.479 --> 00:07:25.437
Also, after getting Realization,

00:07:25.771 --> 00:07:29.021
you realize that all these exist

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:31.646
on our central nervous system.

00:07:32.313 --> 00:07:34.646
They exist on our chakras.

00:07:35.729 --> 00:07:38.479
They are not there

00:07:40.146 --> 00:07:43.646
just because people have told us in history and all that,

00:07:43.938 --> 00:07:45.729
but actually in that's a fact,

00:07:46.938 --> 00:07:49.230
that all of them are there together,

00:07:49.646 --> 00:07:52.813
working out the resurrection of the whole world.

00:07:53.896 --> 00:07:56.646
So the greatest thing that Christ has done

00:07:57.146 --> 00:07:58.938
is the resurrection part

00:07:59.646 --> 00:08:03.271
and in this resurrection, He suffered a lot.

00:08:03.479 --> 00:08:06.396
He had to go through lots of ordeals

00:08:06.938 --> 00:08:09.896
and then His body itself was resurrected.

00:08:11.562 --> 00:08:14.188
On the same lines, Sahaja Yoga is working out

00:08:14.938 --> 00:08:17.146
- that you get your Realization

00:08:17.646 --> 00:08:19.188
means your resurrection.

00:08:20.396 --> 00:08:22.521
All your wrong ideas disappear.

00:08:23.604 --> 00:08:25.687
All your nonsense disappears

00:08:26.355 --> 00:08:28.063
and nothing but love,

00:08:28.771 --> 00:08:31.604
understanding comes in.

00:08:33.105 --> 00:08:35.562
It was difficult, I know, in the beginning

00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:40.396
to start this work in India or otherwise, also everywhere

00:08:40.604 --> 00:08:43.021
I found people are so ignorant

00:08:43.355 --> 00:08:45.729
and human beings hate each other.

00:08:46.854 --> 00:08:49.896
With some excuse, ......... with

00:08:50.105 --> 00:08:53.854
some sort of a - I don't know what ideas they have,

00:08:54.063 --> 00:08:57.562
historical ideas, and they hate.

00:08:59.646 --> 00:09:02.979
This hating in India has been there,

00:09:03.396 --> 00:09:06.105
but also abroad, like Hitler came in.

00:09:06.979 --> 00:09:09.896
Hitler came because he hated human beings.

00:09:10.479 --> 00:09:13.230
He was a satanic force who incarnated

00:09:14.562 --> 00:09:17.105
and did all kinds of horrible things.

00:09:18.063 --> 00:09:20.271
The way he has killed people,

00:09:20.396 --> 00:09:23.938
you can't imagine a human being can do that.

00:09:25.521 --> 00:09:27.146
He killed children.

00:09:28.063 --> 00:09:32.813
He killed grown-up people in the gas chambers and

00:09:33.313 --> 00:09:35.188
- such a horrible thing.

00:09:36.313 --> 00:09:37.355
When I went to Germany,

00:09:37.604 --> 00:09:39.562
they wanted Me to see all that.

00:09:39.771 --> 00:09:44.646
I said, "I can't see. I will not be able to see it."

00:09:45.396 --> 00:09:47.021
But My husband went there

00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:51.938
and when he came back, he was sick for seven days.

00:09:52.938 --> 00:09:53.979
It's so sickening.

00:09:54.479 --> 00:09:57.771
It's so inhuman to behave like that,

00:09:58.437 --> 00:10:01.687
to kill people, under some circumstances,

00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:05.854
under certain conceptions and wrong ideas.

00:10:07.938 --> 00:10:11.355
I don't know what sort of idea this Hitler had

00:10:11.437 --> 00:10:15.521
that he got after the Jews and started killing them.

00:10:17.938 --> 00:10:20.687
All kinds of things have happened on this Earth,

00:10:21.562 --> 00:10:24.771
all in the name of religion. This is the worst part of it.

00:10:25.729 --> 00:10:28.646
Throughout, people have been killing

00:10:28.813 --> 00:10:30.230
in the name of religion.

00:10:30.938 --> 00:10:32.938
Religion teaches you to love,

00:10:33.854 --> 00:10:36.105
to love God and love each other.

00:10:36.896 --> 00:10:40.355
How can it teach you to hate and to kill?

00:10:41.938 --> 00:10:44.396
I mean, it's very surprising, still going on.

00:10:44.938 --> 00:10:47.437
This kind of a nonsense is still going on.

00:10:47.646 --> 00:10:51.313
It's only Sahaja Yoga that can stop this nonsense

00:10:53.063 --> 00:10:56.396
and it should because, after all,

00:10:56.646 --> 00:10:58.188
we are all human beings.

00:10:59.063 --> 00:11:01.562
For that, you have to have your resurrection,

00:11:01.896 --> 00:11:03.479
as Christ had.

00:11:04.105 --> 00:11:07.896
And this resurrection is possible on this Earth,

00:11:08.521 --> 00:11:10.562
very easily now with Sahaja Yoga.

00:11:11.271 --> 00:11:13.896
Muhammad-sahib has called it has miraj.

00:11:15.105 --> 00:11:17.896
He's described it very well, very clearly.

00:11:18.896 --> 00:11:20.313
But who wants that?

00:11:21.646 --> 00:11:23.521
They don't want to have their miraj.

00:11:24.271 --> 00:11:26.105
If somebody tries to work it out,

00:11:26.521 --> 00:11:29.355
they get after that person, saying

00:11:29.562 --> 00:11:31.604
that "This is something ridiculous."

00:11:33.521 --> 00:11:34.729
It's all wrong.

00:11:35.646 --> 00:11:40.146
I mean this has happened with all of them.

00:11:41.021 --> 00:11:42.896
All of them have suffered

00:11:43.188 --> 00:11:46.230
because of the ignorance of human beings - all of them.

00:11:47.896 --> 00:11:53.646
And also with Me, they are criticizing and this and that.

00:11:54.604 --> 00:11:57.396
But I am much more powerful,

00:11:57.729 --> 00:12:00.687
because love is much more powerful than anything else.

00:12:01.979 --> 00:12:04.021
And it's working out all over the world now,

00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:08.729
everywhere people are realizing that this kind of a hatred,

00:12:08.938 --> 00:12:13.063
this kind of a wrong idea about others

00:12:13.646 --> 00:12:16.313
is absolutely dangerous.

00:12:17.604 --> 00:12:23.396
And so, once large number of people know this,

00:12:24.521 --> 00:12:26.562
I'm sure it will all finish off.

00:12:28.896 --> 00:12:32.854
We have lots of incidents like that, even recently.

00:12:33.979 --> 00:12:37.105
That just because you follow a particular religion,

00:12:37.521 --> 00:12:38.646
people hate you.

00:12:39.562 --> 00:12:41.063
I mean I can't understand.

00:12:43.313 --> 00:12:46.188
You cannot explain why, why it is done,

00:12:46.188 --> 00:12:51.271
but it's done and very wrong to hate any human being

00:12:51.813 --> 00:12:56.146
in the name of God, who has created you.

00:12:56.521 --> 00:12:58.813
They don't understand God and His love.

00:13:02.479 --> 00:13:06.979
For example, Christ's life - just see it.

00:13:07.313 --> 00:13:09.896
He was hardly thirty-three years of age

00:13:10.188 --> 00:13:13.687
when He was crucified.

00:13:15.437 --> 00:13:17.729
His mother had to suffer so much.

00:13:19.813 --> 00:13:22.479
Why? Why did they crucify Him?

00:13:23.271 --> 00:13:25.771
Because He was teaching about love.

00:13:27.021 --> 00:13:31.271
None of them liked this idea of loving each other.

00:13:32.521 --> 00:13:34.938
How can you help people if you don't love?

00:13:36.687 --> 00:13:42.188
Under what premises do you help others?

00:13:43.687 --> 00:13:45.188
Because you love,

00:13:45.979 --> 00:13:49.230
that's why you want to enjoy others

00:13:49.521 --> 00:13:51.105
and to understand.

00:13:51.146 --> 00:13:53.646
Once you start loving others,

00:13:54.105 --> 00:13:58.562
then this myth finishes off.

00:13:59.938 --> 00:14:01.979
Supposing you are born as a Christian

00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:04.521
or a Muslim or a Hindu, or whatever it is,

00:14:07.146 --> 00:14:11.646
what makes you think that you are different from others?

00:14:13.188 --> 00:14:14.729
You are born the same way.

00:14:15.938 --> 00:14:18.313
You are conceived by your mother the same way.

00:14:19.271 --> 00:14:20.687
You look the same way.

00:14:21.521 --> 00:14:24.230
Your nose, eyes, everything is the same.

00:14:25.355 --> 00:14:26.813
What makes you different?

00:14:28.521 --> 00:14:31.063
I think it's something political about it,

00:14:32.979 --> 00:14:34.437
something very mean

00:14:35.188 --> 00:14:39.562
to separate people in the name of God and religion.

00:14:40.687 --> 00:14:42.938
On the contrary, Sahaja Yoga is to

00:14:43.146 --> 00:14:45.854
unite all the people in the name of God,

00:14:47.313 --> 00:14:49.771
to make them one in the name of God.

00:14:50.938 --> 00:14:53.271
Supposing there is somebody living,

00:14:54.021 --> 00:14:56.646
say, in South Africa

00:14:57.979 --> 00:15:02.437
or say, in a far-fetched place like Benin and all that

00:15:02.687 --> 00:15:04.313
- has become a Sahaja Yogi.

00:15:04.729 --> 00:15:08.188
There are thousands who have become Sahaja Yogis there.

00:15:08.687 --> 00:15:10.687
They are all your bothers and sisters.

00:15:11.646 --> 00:15:13.021
They're your own.

00:15:13.562 --> 00:15:16.021
You go there and they will

00:15:16.313 --> 00:15:19.105
treat you just like their own children, their own relations.

00:15:22.355 --> 00:15:24.979
They will never think what religion you come from

00:15:25.355 --> 00:15:27.979
or what sect you come from, nothing.

00:15:28.646 --> 00:15:31.479
I was surprised the way they have love.

00:15:32.105 --> 00:15:35.687
Actually, loving is an innate quality of human beings.

00:15:36.771 --> 00:15:40.271
It's an innate quality. Every human being has been

00:15:40.437 --> 00:15:44.271
given this treasure of loving, loving capacity.

00:15:45.105 --> 00:15:50.188
But that capacity has become so much less,

00:15:50.813 --> 00:15:54.729
so much minimum, that, with that capacity,

00:15:55.021 --> 00:15:59.813
people fight and kill each other.

00:16:01.813 --> 00:16:06.021
It's a greatest sin to kill people in the name of religion.

00:16:08.313 --> 00:16:10.105
I don't know what - how they believe

00:16:10.646 --> 00:16:14.271
that, by killing each other, we can go to heaven.

00:16:14.479 --> 00:16:16.146
They will go to the worst hell.

00:16:19.437 --> 00:16:23.771
This idea has now, of course, subsided a little,

00:16:24.146 --> 00:16:26.105
but still existing.

00:16:26.562 --> 00:16:28.687
They see it happening every day,

00:16:29.355 --> 00:16:34.313
this kind of a nonsense, but still they are continuing with it.

00:16:35.437 --> 00:16:37.646
Now what can we Sahaja Yogis do about it?

00:16:37.854 --> 00:16:38.938
We should think.

00:16:39.854 --> 00:16:43.437
Let us see, whatever religion we are born, that's what.

00:16:43.646 --> 00:16:46.063
You have to be born in some religion.

00:16:46.854 --> 00:16:48.437
You cannot drop from heaven.

00:16:50.271 --> 00:16:55.355
So whatever religion you are born, you are not bound by that.

00:16:56.479 --> 00:17:01.230
You are bound by the religion of love and joy.

00:17:02.646 --> 00:17:05.146
And then you go on crying and weeping

00:17:05.355 --> 00:17:12.313
and teaching and … of unhappiness, of fighting.

00:17:13.562 --> 00:17:15.854
How can that be? We are human beings.

00:17:16.355 --> 00:17:17.355
They are not animals.

00:17:17.604 --> 00:17:19.437
Even the dogs don't do that way.

00:17:20.646 --> 00:17:22.896
Why should we human beings kill each other

00:17:23.979 --> 00:17:31.355
and make a miserable life for others and for yourself?

00:17:32.687 --> 00:17:34.479
Because if you hate others,

00:17:35.437 --> 00:17:37.437
you will also become hateful.

00:17:38.437 --> 00:17:42.813
A will hate the B and then the B will hate the A,

00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:46.355
so the whole human life and civilization

00:17:46.604 --> 00:17:48.979
has nothing to do but to hate!

00:17:53.355 --> 00:17:56.230
Sahaja Yoga is such a blessing to you, I must say,

00:17:56.979 --> 00:18:01.105
because it has given to you all the Deities within you, enlightened

00:18:01.562 --> 00:18:04.188
and now you know you are belong to the whole.

00:18:04.437 --> 00:18:07.604
You know you are not belonging to some stupid ideas.

00:18:11.646 --> 00:18:14.105
It's very remarkable when I came here.

00:18:16.437 --> 00:18:19.646
I knew Mary lived here. I knew Mother Mary lived here.

00:18:19.896 --> 00:18:24.021
There is a house of Mother Mary.

00:18:24.646 --> 00:18:29.729
That gave Me a very great joy to know that She had lived here

00:18:30.562 --> 00:18:32.771
and so I said we must worship Her.

00:18:34.604 --> 00:18:36.896
After all, She was a mother of Christ!

00:18:37.854 --> 00:18:39.021
Mother is a mother.

00:18:40.646 --> 00:18:43.604
What does it matter whether She was a Christian, Hindu, Muslim?

00:18:43.813 --> 00:18:45.146
It doesn't matter.

00:18:45.896 --> 00:18:49.729
And for Her love, She allowed Her son to be sacrificed

00:18:50.437 --> 00:18:53.687
for the whole world and for the universe - what a mother!

00:18:55.230 --> 00:18:57.146
Can you find such a mother in this world

00:18:57.854 --> 00:19:01.896
who will allow Her own son to be crucified -

00:19:04.604 --> 00:19:10.521
such a courageous, loving and global personality.

00:19:12.271 --> 00:19:15.687
Here we are. It's a coincidence, as I said,

00:19:16.271 --> 00:19:17.771
because She lived here.

00:19:18.521 --> 00:19:19.521
Why did She come?

00:19:21.813 --> 00:19:24.271
Why did She come here? She could have gone directly.

00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:30.188
She came here and lived and we have a house of Her.

00:19:30.771 --> 00:19:32.146
Now with this house only,

00:19:32.355 --> 00:19:34.479
the Christians will start a cult.

00:19:35.854 --> 00:19:39.105
They'll fight with the Muslims

00:19:39.479 --> 00:19:42.896
and the Muslims will fight with the Christians.

00:19:43.146 --> 00:19:45.271
Anything you do, they will fight.

00:19:45.813 --> 00:19:48.729
That's the main character is to fight,

00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:53.230
not to help others, not to help each other - no, not at all.

00:19:54.437 --> 00:19:59.105
They're just trying to be very, very funny and nasty.

00:20:01.105 --> 00:20:05.313
In India we have had so many nice people

00:20:05.521 --> 00:20:07.646
who taught that we must love each other.

00:20:08.854 --> 00:20:11.188
Despite that, in India people are fighting.

00:20:13.355 --> 00:20:15.813
They have had so many Sufis in this country.

00:20:16.355 --> 00:20:18.188
In the same way, in India also,

00:20:18.771 --> 00:20:23.105
we have had very great saints, very great - everywhere.

00:20:23.771 --> 00:20:25.355
Some of them were Muslims,

00:20:25.896 --> 00:20:27.479
some of them were Hindus

00:20:27.979 --> 00:20:30.729
and people sing their songs; everything's there.

00:20:31.063 --> 00:20:37.063
But, they're worshipped separately

00:20:37.271 --> 00:20:39.646
and people fight even in their names.

00:20:40.271 --> 00:20:42.355
They want to find something to fight.

00:20:43.687 --> 00:20:46.063
Real fighting cocks, I tell you they are.

00:20:46.646 --> 00:20:48.979
They haven't got a human quality within them,

00:20:49.355 --> 00:20:53.188
which is love, which is affection-

00:20:54.271 --> 00:20:57.146
must enjoy your love for each other.

00:20:57.979 --> 00:21:01.562
That's the thing they have lost their capacity to love.

00:21:02.771 --> 00:21:05.938
What does it matter if somebody is born

00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:08.604
in China or in India or anywhere?

00:21:09.313 --> 00:21:10.729
He is a human being.

00:21:11.646 --> 00:21:14.146
He, too, has the capacity to love

00:21:14.521 --> 00:21:17.813
and you should also have capacity to love.

00:21:20.479 --> 00:21:22.105
My experience is different.

00:21:23.521 --> 00:21:25.479
I went to China with My husband.

00:21:26.437 --> 00:21:27.355
In China

00:21:27.562 --> 00:21:30.355
that time, they didn't have any good feelings for Indians,

00:21:30.604 --> 00:21:31.521
I don't know why.

00:21:32.854 --> 00:21:36.188
But they were so kind to Me, you won't believe,

00:21:37.562 --> 00:21:38.938
so nice to Me

00:21:40.105 --> 00:21:41.646
and the way they treated Me,

00:21:41.854 --> 00:21:44.146
everybody was surprised, " What's the matter? "

00:21:45.687 --> 00:21:47.355
"How are they so kind to you? "

00:21:47.854 --> 00:21:49.896
"In China they don't like Indians."

00:21:50.813 --> 00:21:51.979
I said, "It's a myth. "

00:21:52.355 --> 00:21:54.729
"I don't think I have seen that with the Chinese. "

00:21:55.646 --> 00:22:01.521
"They're extremely, extremely kind and respectful to Me. "

00:22:02.687 --> 00:22:04.687
"What have I done for them? Nothing."

00:22:05.271 --> 00:22:07.813
Well, you'll be surprised, in one of the hotels,

00:22:08.896 --> 00:22:13.230
one of My ankle ornament[s] had fallen down - silver.

00:22:15.896 --> 00:22:22.063
It did happen and then I went away to a very far fetched place

00:22:23.063 --> 00:22:26.646
and they sent it in an envelope, those anklets.

00:22:27.188 --> 00:22:28.271
Can you imagine?

00:22:29.646 --> 00:22:34.355
All the way - I was so much full of tears.

00:22:36.021 --> 00:22:38.896
So I said "These Chinese are also very loving people,

00:22:39.105 --> 00:22:40.938
extremely loving."

00:22:41.521 --> 00:22:44.521
I went for My program.

00:22:45.979 --> 00:22:49.105
We had a women's conference.

00:22:50.479 --> 00:22:51.896
So I don't know why,

00:22:52.729 --> 00:22:56.021
but at the airport only these Chinese boys arrived.

00:22:57.105 --> 00:22:59.521
They took all My luggage. I was so late!

00:23:00.355 --> 00:23:05.230
The function was at ten o'clock and I reached about 8:30.

00:23:05.896 --> 00:23:07.479
They put Me in the car.

00:23:08.188 --> 00:23:09.646
They put My luggage there

00:23:09.813 --> 00:23:11.604
and they said, "We have to directly

00:23:11.813 --> 00:23:14.396
go to the conference." I said, "All right."

00:23:15.271 --> 00:23:19.271
I went there and in this short time,

00:23:19.562 --> 00:23:22.646
these boys were really so attached to Me.

00:23:24.146 --> 00:23:26.562
When I finished the conference, they're waiting outside

00:23:27.188 --> 00:23:28.313
- can't believe it -

00:23:28.604 --> 00:23:32.230
the same Chinese people who are against Indians.

00:23:33.646 --> 00:23:36.604
And then, after that, it didn't stop.

00:23:36.854 --> 00:23:38.063
They brought two cars -

00:23:39.396 --> 00:23:42.105
one for My wheelchair, one for Me

00:23:42.896 --> 00:23:47.854
- and they took Me to the best shopping places.

00:23:48.437 --> 00:23:50.021
But I said, "What will you do?"

00:23:50.479 --> 00:23:52.729
They said, 'We'll carry your wheelchair upstairs.

00:23:53.146 --> 00:23:54.271
Can you imagine?

00:23:55.021 --> 00:23:56.938
They were no relation of mine.

00:23:57.146 --> 00:23:59.063
I've never seen them before.

00:24:00.313 --> 00:24:01.896
So one of them said,

00:24:02.105 --> 00:24:05.604
"Tomorrow, Mother, I won't be able to come." I said, "Why?"

00:24:05.896 --> 00:24:07.687
He said, "I'm getting married tomorrow."

00:24:08.105 --> 00:24:10.355
And I said, "What have you been doing all this day?"

00:24:12.313 --> 00:24:14.562
He said, "I enjoyed your company so much"

00:24:14.771 --> 00:24:17.355
I'm such an old woman like Me - young people.

00:24:18.146 --> 00:24:19.729
"No, no, no, no, I've enjoyed.

00:24:19.854 --> 00:24:23.479
I'll also bring my bride for You to be seen."

00:24:23.771 --> 00:24:24.771
I tell you,

00:24:25.355 --> 00:24:26.979
tears came into my eyes.

00:24:27.396 --> 00:24:30.604
I said, "Such love, such kindness."

00:24:31.021 --> 00:24:33.146
I didn't do anything for them, nothing.

00:24:33.355 --> 00:24:35.604
I didn't give them any money, nothing.

00:24:36.646 --> 00:24:40.896
My goodness, till the end they were so much attentive to Me

00:24:41.562 --> 00:24:45.479
- very young boys, all below twenty-five years of age.

00:24:47.313 --> 00:24:49.479
And they carried My Wheelchair

00:24:49.729 --> 00:24:52.896
up three storeys with their hands.

00:24:53.437 --> 00:24:55.063
I said, "Don't do it, I don't want …"

00:24:55.188 --> 00:24:57.188
(They said,) "No, no, no, no, we want You to see."

00:24:57.313 --> 00:24:58.854
"We want You to come."

00:25:00.188 --> 00:25:01.021
I said, "Why?"

00:25:01.854 --> 00:25:03.813
[They] said, "It would be nice for all of them."

00:25:04.313 --> 00:25:06.604
I don't know what made them think like that.

00:25:07.396 --> 00:25:09.646
Such enlightened people, I tell you.

00:25:10.021 --> 00:25:12.105
With love, you get enlightened.

00:25:12.646 --> 00:25:16.063
With love, you get understanding.

00:25:17.271 --> 00:25:20.063
And such deep love exists within you.

00:25:20.854 --> 00:25:22.687
Now the politicians will come

00:25:22.813 --> 00:25:24.230
and tell you a story.

00:25:24.562 --> 00:25:26.437
Then somebody else will tell you,

00:25:26.687 --> 00:25:28.355
"Come and fight" and all that.

00:25:28.687 --> 00:25:31.479
That's how they have managed in Germany, young people.

00:25:33.188 --> 00:25:37.063
But now, now they're changing.

00:25:38.146 --> 00:25:40.313
All this world has to change

00:25:40.813 --> 00:25:42.729
because it has suffered a lot.

00:25:43.355 --> 00:25:44.938
This is no religion.

00:25:46.437 --> 00:25:49.687
This is not the teachings of the saints - no.

00:25:50.479 --> 00:25:51.687
It is not.

00:25:51.938 --> 00:25:55.687
It is devilish, that teaches you to hate others,

00:25:56.146 --> 00:25:57.604
is the worst thing.

00:25:58.479 --> 00:26:02.146
I mean all the enjoyment of love,

00:26:03.188 --> 00:26:07.938
all the enjoyment of affection, you don't know.

00:26:10.938 --> 00:26:14.146
Nowadays, you see the problem of the churches, this, that.

00:26:14.146 --> 00:26:16.479
I can't understand, stupid people.

00:26:18.896 --> 00:26:20.604
They have done so many laws

00:26:21.396 --> 00:26:24.771
and with that laws, whatever it is, whatever may be the causes,

00:26:25.479 --> 00:26:29.646
but what's happening is that poor children are suffering.

00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:33.729
They have no sense of pure love.

00:26:35.813 --> 00:26:38.729
Nobody understands what is poor love is.

00:26:38.979 --> 00:26:42.437
Which is actually their innate quality, their innate -

00:26:42.896 --> 00:26:45.063
I should say the 'property'.

00:26:46.063 --> 00:26:50.771
But they don't know how you can love somebody purely!

00:26:52.355 --> 00:26:57.562
It's all something very, very wretched.

00:26:57.813 --> 00:27:00.604
It doesn't behove human beings to be like that.

00:27:01.021 --> 00:27:02.938
Even the animals are not like that,

00:27:04.063 --> 00:27:06.896
but human beings can go to any extreme.

00:27:08.604 --> 00:27:10.355
The whole wealth of beauty,

00:27:10.562 --> 00:27:12.813
the whole wealth of creativity,

00:27:13.437 --> 00:27:16.646
the whole wealth of art, artistic temperament,

00:27:16.896 --> 00:27:20.479
the whole wealth of enjoying life is finished.

00:27:22.437 --> 00:27:24.646
If you are a fighting cock,

00:27:25.687 --> 00:27:29.771
you can't see anything, any good in anyone, in anything.

00:27:30.813 --> 00:27:32.396
They will fight others

00:27:32.604 --> 00:27:35.271
and they'll fight among themselves also - is a fact.

00:27:36.021 --> 00:27:38.604
They might say, "We must fight." All right, fight.

00:27:38.813 --> 00:27:42.146
But then they fight among themselves also.

00:27:42.355 --> 00:27:46.146
They will torture their own brothers and sisters.

00:27:46.938 --> 00:27:50.854
I mean, they don't love anyone. This is the main thing is.

00:27:51.230 --> 00:27:53.063
Why take the name of religion?

00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:55.979
What the religion has done?

00:27:56.687 --> 00:27:58.729
How could the religion teach you such a

00:27:58.938 --> 00:28:02.313
horrible thing like hatred for your own?

00:28:04.604 --> 00:28:08.146
It's not only among Christians, Hindus, Muslims, but

00:28:08.355 --> 00:28:14.813
everywhere human beings have become very dirty and filthy.

00:28:15.896 --> 00:28:17.479
They say it is Kali Yuga.

00:28:18.437 --> 00:28:19.938
I can't understand.

00:28:21.021 --> 00:28:23.146
How can you lose the power to love?

00:28:23.562 --> 00:28:26.105
That's what Christ has talked about.

00:28:26.646 --> 00:28:29.105
He's talked about love very clearly.

00:28:30.271 --> 00:28:33.063
He said, "Love thy neighbour as thyself."

00:28:33.313 --> 00:28:35.105
Have you found anyone like that?

00:28:38.854 --> 00:28:40.646
You don't find all such people.

00:28:41.479 --> 00:28:45.896
The Christians who followed Christ, what did they do?

00:28:47.396 --> 00:28:50.562
Muslims who followed Mohammed-sahib, what did they do?

00:28:51.313 --> 00:28:55.146
And Hindus who followed Shri Rama, what did they do?

00:28:56.146 --> 00:28:59.063
Are they anywhere near their leaders?

00:28:59.479 --> 00:29:02.896
Are they anywhere near those Incarnations of the Divine?

00:29:03.105 --> 00:29:04.105
Nowhere.

00:29:04.896 --> 00:29:07.021
The reason is - I don't blame them

00:29:07.437 --> 00:29:09.437
- because they had no Realization.

00:29:10.604 --> 00:29:12.437
They didn't know their spirit.

00:29:13.063 --> 00:29:14.771
If you have no Realization,

00:29:15.271 --> 00:29:17.729
you cannot understand anything,

00:29:18.063 --> 00:29:22.230
you cannot understand any enjoyment or anything.

00:29:23.896 --> 00:29:24.938
I mean,

00:29:25.771 --> 00:29:27.646
if you go to Germany,

00:29:29.355 --> 00:29:32.355
you can't go and see all the things they have done.

00:29:32.979 --> 00:29:36.521
You'll faint, if you have any human qualities.

00:29:37.188 --> 00:29:39.813
Even you go to Japan

00:29:40.105 --> 00:29:43.105
and they way they had put this Hiroshima,

00:29:44.355 --> 00:29:45.604
this - my goodness,

00:29:46.313 --> 00:29:48.979
I started trembling, I couldn't bear it.

00:29:49.230 --> 00:29:52.729
I said, "How could human beings be that cruel?"

00:29:54.646 --> 00:29:55.938
Horrible!

00:29:56.687 --> 00:29:57.979
I mean now the days have come that

00:29:58.188 --> 00:29:59.687
they're killing their own children.

00:30:00.562 --> 00:30:01.938
Extreme is this.

00:30:03.105 --> 00:30:05.355
The other side of it is Sahaja Yoga,

00:30:06.188 --> 00:30:09.771
in which you love all human beings

00:30:10.896 --> 00:30:13.437
because they're human beings.

00:30:14.562 --> 00:30:17.146
They're born with you in this time.

00:30:18.230 --> 00:30:19.896
You have to help each other

00:30:20.313 --> 00:30:21.729
and love each other.

00:30:23.230 --> 00:30:24.396
This is the main thing.

00:30:24.687 --> 00:30:26.521
If you can develop this,

00:30:27.146 --> 00:30:29.396
you'll be very, very strong Sahaja Yogis

00:30:29.938 --> 00:30:33.355
and you will be supported and blessed by the Divine.

00:30:34.896 --> 00:30:36.313
Divine will help you

00:30:36.729 --> 00:30:39.105
and take you out of all troubles

00:30:39.562 --> 00:30:43.271
and tribulations and all kinds of difficulties,

00:30:43.771 --> 00:30:47.479
if you are a loving personality.

00:30:48.063 --> 00:30:50.771
This is what the blessing of Kali Yuga.

00:30:51.021 --> 00:30:52.188
It didn't exist (like this before.)

00:30:52.604 --> 00:30:56.979
Now, if you are a loving person,

00:30:57.854 --> 00:31:00.979
the Divine will go out of the way to help you,

00:31:01.521 --> 00:31:03.562
to sort out your problems,

00:31:04.146 --> 00:31:06.146
to punish those who are troubling you.

00:31:06.355 --> 00:31:08.813
I mean, it's My own experience like that.

00:31:09.896 --> 00:31:12.230
I never do anything. I never curse anybody.

00:31:12.437 --> 00:31:13.896
I don't fight. I don't shout.

00:31:15.479 --> 00:31:17.437
Automatically, it works.

00:31:18.313 --> 00:31:20.687
I don't even tell the Divine to do anything.

00:31:21.396 --> 00:31:28.271
The Divine is at the greatest, just personality,

00:31:28.437 --> 00:31:31.938
I should say. That is the one who does all the justice.

00:31:32.938 --> 00:31:37.938
Nobody can suffer under the guidance and love of Divine,

00:31:38.188 --> 00:31:39.146
take it from Me.

00:31:39.854 --> 00:31:41.687
This is the blessing of Kali Yuga.

00:31:41.896 --> 00:31:44.105
I agree Kali Yuga is horrible.

00:31:44.521 --> 00:31:46.854
People are horrible. This is that.

00:31:47.146 --> 00:31:49.437
But there's one thing

00:31:49.854 --> 00:31:55.271
that this Divine has become very alert.

00:31:55.437 --> 00:31:56.896
It was never that alert.

00:31:57.979 --> 00:31:59.896
If Christ was born at this time,

00:32:00.146 --> 00:32:01.979
He could not have been crucified.

00:32:05.188 --> 00:32:09.479
It's only because He was not born during Kali Yuga.

00:32:10.479 --> 00:32:12.604
That's a very big blessing for us.

00:32:12.938 --> 00:32:14.687
Nobody can be tortured.

00:32:15.146 --> 00:32:17.313
Nobody can be troubled.

00:32:18.355 --> 00:32:21.771
Only thing, you have to be a humble person.

00:32:22.771 --> 00:32:24.813
You have to have a good character

00:32:25.729 --> 00:32:29.979
and you have to have a very loving personality.

00:32:30.188 --> 00:32:31.479
That's all.

00:32:31.854 --> 00:32:34.021
You'll enjoy the loving personality.

00:32:34.896 --> 00:32:36.687
You'll get the blessings

00:32:37.355 --> 00:32:39.063
because [of] you're loving personality.

00:32:39.396 --> 00:32:41.979
I mean, the way the Divine looks after you,

00:32:42.521 --> 00:32:44.938
there are so many miracles people tell Me.

00:32:45.562 --> 00:32:47.521
I'm not surprised because I know

00:32:47.813 --> 00:32:51.021
the Divine has become extremely alert

00:32:51.604 --> 00:32:54.854
towards human beings who are good and nice.

00:32:55.479 --> 00:32:56.562
It will look after.

00:32:56.854 --> 00:32:59.105
It will support. It will do everything.

00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:03.938
It's very surprising that it has become so alert.

00:33:04.687 --> 00:33:06.771
Like Muahmmed-sahib suffered so much.

00:33:07.063 --> 00:33:10.479
Everybody suffered so much, but not now.

00:33:10.687 --> 00:33:12.604
Now the Sahaja Yogis won't suffer.

00:33:12.646 --> 00:33:14.105
Take it from Me.

00:33:14.854 --> 00:33:17.896
They're looked after by the Divine itself.

00:33:18.562 --> 00:33:21.146
Everything is looked after. I will tell you,

00:33:21.313 --> 00:33:24.479
people have written letters after letters all over the world,

00:33:24.896 --> 00:33:26.562
how they have been supported,

00:33:27.063 --> 00:33:28.813
how they have been helped.

00:33:29.521 --> 00:33:33.437
Very surprising how they have been rescued.

00:33:37.729 --> 00:33:42.313
So we have to trust in ourselves

00:33:43.271 --> 00:33:46.604
and we have to really love people.

00:33:47.521 --> 00:33:50.230
We should be humble and love.

00:33:50.771 --> 00:33:54.729
All this love will help you all your life.

00:33:55.437 --> 00:33:58.146
This is the message of Christ.

00:33:58.437 --> 00:34:00.938
Christ has said, "Forgive them."

00:34:01.396 --> 00:34:02.562
How lovingly He said,

00:34:02.729 --> 00:34:05.604
"But they don't know what they're doing."

00:34:06.437 --> 00:34:08.562
Very lovingly He pleads

00:34:08.813 --> 00:34:11.604
for all the bad people who crucified Him,

00:34:11.896 --> 00:34:13.938
that "Oh, Lord, please forgive them

00:34:14.479 --> 00:34:16.604
because they don't know what they are doing."

00:34:17.188 --> 00:34:20.479
Can you imagine such a loving character of Christ?

00:34:20.813 --> 00:34:27.021
And now, when we are celebrating and worshipping Him,

00:34:27.479 --> 00:34:30.021
we have to worship that character within us,

00:34:30.396 --> 00:34:32.479
that we are also loving people.

00:34:32.813 --> 00:34:33.979
We love each other.

00:34:34.355 --> 00:34:37.938
All over the world, all the Sahaja Yogis love each other.

00:34:38.271 --> 00:34:41.230
Of course, there could be one or two who are not so good,

00:34:41.437 --> 00:34:45.437
but mostly, ninety-nine percent Sahaja Yogis love each other.

00:34:46.063 --> 00:34:48.771
My blessings to you is this -

00:34:48.979 --> 00:34:53.646
on this day may God give you lots of love,

00:34:54.479 --> 00:34:57.437
and loving capacity within you,

00:34:58.063 --> 00:34:59.729
that you should have,

00:35:00.021 --> 00:35:02.646
which will change your life completely

00:35:02.979 --> 00:35:06.105
and you'll become such a powerful personality,

00:35:06.687 --> 00:35:09.230
very powerful Sahaja Yogis.

00:35:10.230 --> 00:35:13.604
You can do marvels and miracles

00:35:14.313 --> 00:35:18.604
if you have developed the understanding of love.

00:35:20.105 --> 00:35:21.604
May God bless you
