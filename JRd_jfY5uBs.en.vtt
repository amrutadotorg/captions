00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:51.060
Today we are worshipping Adi Shakti.

00:01:52.140 --> 00:02:00.180
I think this is the most important puja

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:09.380
because it is the power of Adi Shakti

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:13.460
that has given you Self Realisation,

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.340
that has given you the Truth,

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:23.460
that has given you the power of compassion and love.

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:45.540
That's the power that separated from Sadashiva

00:02:47.820 --> 00:03:05.780
and this power wanted Herself to create this complete universe.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:16.220
Universes after universes, She's creating and loving.

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:24.660
With Her love, She did this great creation,

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:30.180
creation of this world also.

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:36.780
This is a specially selected planet,

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:43.540
which was very beautifully brought in the centre

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.140
between the sun and the moon

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:56.500
for the creation of, ultimately, the human beings.

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:09.820
This is Her great work with such love and affection

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:13.780
and with very great hope

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:22.980
that Her children will know the truth

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.820
and will get the ultimate knowledge about themselves

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:32.100
and about everything else.

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:42.620
As you have read in the Bible

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:49.420
about how Adi Shakti came in the form of a snake

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.780
and told human beings

00:04:52.940 --> 00:05:01.860
that you have to know the knowledge,

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:08.220
Adam and Eve, and to Eve specially,

00:05:08.383 --> 00:05:15.060
and they accepted to eat the fruit of knowledge

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:23.050
because they would have remained just like animals,

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:27.010
without knowing anything subtleties of life —

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:30.770
little higher animals maybe —

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:39.290
that once they ate the fruit they started feeling

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:43.210
that there is something wrong the

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:47.330
way they are without any clothes,

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:52.850
so they brought some leaves of the tree

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:56.450
and covered themselves.

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:03.850
So the first knowledge came was of chastity

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:10.210
because Shri Ganesha was established

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:18.370
and His influence brought forth this consciousness

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:21.450
that we have to cover our bodies.

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:25.010
We are no more animals.

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:29.130
Only the animals

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:31.970
— of course, they're not standing, so it is all right —

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:35.130
are not aware of it.

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:44.090
With the knowledge of chastity,

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:48.410
gradually human beings started growing

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:53.130
into beautiful nations,

00:06:54.810 --> 00:07:01.410
but there are so many things, which were still to be known,

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:05.810
to be aware of it.

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:14.490
You may be aware of many things,

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:27.930
but unless and until you get your spiritual awakening,

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:33.570
unless and until you get your self knowledge,

00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:40.050
all other knowledge is absolutely nothing.

00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:49.770
With this self knowledge only, you become powerful.

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:57.490
The real power — the real power is of love and compassion.

00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:08.970
Today when you see the whole world is busy fighting

00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:14.810
and they are trying to protect people

00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:19.730
from wars and creating

00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:28.370
great, huge, protecting instruments.

00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:34.610
The whole world seems to be in a mad race

00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:40.690
of killing each other, of destroying each other,

00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:49.810
of competition, ambition,

00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:55.330
leading to fighting and then to greater wars.

00:08:55.610 --> 00:09:01.170
They're fighting for a piece of land.

00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:05.490
So ignorant they are.

00:09:05.650 --> 00:09:14.330
Can you carry even a pinch of this land with you

00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:17.130
when you die?

00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:23.370
When you are born you come with closed fists.

00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:28.570
When you die you go with open hands.

00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:32.730
What do you take with you?

00:09:32.890 --> 00:09:37.690
All right, you may not like to take anything,

00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:42.090
but do you enjoy whatever you think is so great

00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:45.530
for which you are fighting?

00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:53.090
Why this fighting going on among all nonsensical people?

00:09:53.930 --> 00:10:03.250
It's surprising how people give up their peace,

00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:06.490
give up their understanding

00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:12.250
when it comes to a piece of land.

00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:22.090
And the whole thing has moved into a very wrong direction

00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:28.530
and going towards complete destruction.

00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:39.450
The thing that has made human beings so much suffering

00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:47.570
because of all their ignorance,

00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:54.010
by which they have all those habits,

00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:57.850
all those attractions,

00:10:58.010 --> 00:11:04.610
all those identification, which is ruinous,

00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:12.330
which will ruin all of them, each one by one.

00:11:14.410 --> 00:11:16.930
They have to take to sense

00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:24.370
and they have to take to their self knowledge.

00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:33.010
Self knowledge is the key

00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:41.290
for a saviour to give to people.

00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:46.970
We have had so many saints.

00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:51.250
We have had so many Sufis.

00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:55.970
We had Tao people. We had Zen people.

00:11:56.130 --> 00:12:02.210
All kinds of realised souls came on this Earth.

00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:09.170
They all suffered. They were tortured. Nobody understood them.

00:12:10.610 --> 00:12:18.170
But now the time has come for you to know the truth,

00:12:18.650 --> 00:12:25.210
but truth which is not dry, truth which has compassion,

00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:29.370
truth that encompasses everyone,

00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:37.730
that brings the complete view of our existence.

00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:44.370
Why are we here on this Earth? What is our purpose?

00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:47.490
What should we do? Adi Shakti's

00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:52.890
powers are such

00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:56.650
of love and compassion,

00:12:56.810 --> 00:13:02.010
that makes you understand your self first.

00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:09.450
The love, for you, is very, very limited.

00:13:10.010 --> 00:13:17.130
There's no awareness of your own being.

00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:22.250
Just imagine what a great task is for you,

00:13:22.810 --> 00:13:28.410
how much you have to be seriously

00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:33.250
becoming aware of your self first.

00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:38.050
That is extremely important.

00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:43.330
First you have to be aware of your self.

00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:49.690
And now you have the light of your spirit.

00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:54.610
In the light of that spirit you can see what you are

00:13:54.930 --> 00:13:58.410
and you can see how far you are going,

00:13:58.570 --> 00:14:02.210
how wrong things you are doing,

00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:06.730
what harm you are doing to yourself

00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:11.250
and you have a power to cure it,

00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:16.610
to improve it and to come to your senses.

00:14:16.770 --> 00:14:21.170
These are the most important times.

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:24.490
You will never get these times again.

00:14:24.650 --> 00:14:31.450
Never had it in the history and you can never get it in the future.

00:14:32.410 --> 00:14:39.370
This is the time you have got, not only the awareness,

00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:43.610
not only the self knowledge,

00:14:43.770 --> 00:14:47.810
but you know how to do it.

00:14:48.210 --> 00:14:51.330
Otherwise, about the saints,

00:14:51.490 --> 00:14:56.010
about those people, Tao and Zen people,

00:14:56.170 --> 00:14:58.850
they have just described

00:14:59.010 --> 00:15:05.770
what a person with self knowledge is,

00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:10.970
how he behaves, how his style is,

00:15:11.130 --> 00:15:14.130
how he's so different from others.

00:15:14.290 --> 00:15:19.330
But none of them have said how you become that.

00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:23.970
No one has been able to say that.

00:15:24.130 --> 00:15:28.130
Nobody has been able to do that also

00:15:28.290 --> 00:15:36.730
because perhaps most of them didn't know about kundalini

00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:44.090
and those who knew also could not talk about it to people.

00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:50.330
So the greatest work of the Adi Shakti is

00:15:50.490 --> 00:15:59.770
to put the kundalini in your sacrum bone.

00:16:01.890 --> 00:16:08.290
This kundalini is not the Adi Shakti.

00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:12.010
The Adi Shakti is a much greater thing, a much bigger thing,

00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:17.490
much wider thing, much deeper, much stronger,

00:16:17.690 --> 00:16:20.930
much stronger, much more powerful.

00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:28.770
Kundalini is the reflection of Adi Shakti power

00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:36.210
and when She rises you know what happens to you

00:16:36.650 --> 00:16:42.450
and how you get your Realisation.

00:16:43.650 --> 00:16:47.410
But you have to be very watchful.

00:16:47.650 --> 00:16:52.410
Are you really a compassionate person?

00:16:54.130 --> 00:16:56.970
If you are compassionate,

00:16:57.130 --> 00:17:00.650
the first thing that will happen to any compassionate person,

00:17:00.810 --> 00:17:07.530
I think, will be to help others,

00:17:07.690 --> 00:17:10.450
to emancipate others.

00:17:10.610 --> 00:17:16.930
They cannot be satisfied with their own achievements

00:17:17.090 --> 00:17:26.130
and with their own state of Self Realisation.

00:17:26.290 --> 00:17:28.730
It cannot happen.

00:17:29.170 --> 00:17:35.210
What was the need for the Adi Shakti to do all, all these efforts

00:17:35.370 --> 00:17:37.050
to work so hard?

00:17:37.210 --> 00:17:42.210
You know that, that I had to work very, very hard,

00:17:42.370 --> 00:17:45.850
but, from my very childhood

00:17:46.490 --> 00:17:49.410
I've worked very hard

00:17:49.570 --> 00:17:54.850
and I've gone through very difficult times,

00:17:55.010 --> 00:18:01.890
very, very difficult times according to human understanding,

00:18:02.050 --> 00:18:08.050
but the worst time I have, when I see

00:18:08.210 --> 00:18:12.450
those people whom I have given Realisation,

00:18:12.610 --> 00:18:16.570
those who are self-realised people,

00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:24.370
they are the ones who have no responsibility for others

00:18:24.530 --> 00:18:28.410
and, if they have, it is very little.

00:18:28.570 --> 00:18:31.730
They don't have that compassion

00:18:31.890 --> 00:18:34.770
and don't have that love

00:18:34.930 --> 00:18:38.610
that we have to today save the world,

00:18:38.770 --> 00:18:41.010
save the humanity.

00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:47.410
That's our — not only our principal work,

00:18:47.570 --> 00:18:52.410
but the only work that we have to do.

00:18:52.570 --> 00:18:57.930
All other things are going to achieve nothing,

00:18:58.090 --> 00:19:03.850
except for your own efforts here,

00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:06.690
individual efforts

00:19:06.850 --> 00:19:10.170
to give Self Realisation to others

00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:14.170
and give them this knowledge.

00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:20.210
This knowledge is so, so easy to understand.

00:19:20.370 --> 00:19:23.850
It is very subtle, no doubt,

00:19:24.010 --> 00:19:26.770
and, as I've told you,

00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:33.130
that the quantum theory they're talking about now, the scientists,

00:19:33.290 --> 00:19:39.210
is that they have seen those miraculous waves of lights

00:19:39.370 --> 00:19:44.490
and they are trying to find out something about it.

00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:51.690
It cannot be that some Sahaja Yogis will rise above others.

00:19:51.850 --> 00:19:58.970
Every one of you [has] to know that this is a very special thing

00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:02.210
that has happened to you.

00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:04.930
Even if you had gone to Himalayas,

00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:07.650
even if you have starved yourself,

00:20:07.810 --> 00:20:14.130
even if you have been singing the praise of God for years,

00:20:14.290 --> 00:20:21.010
even you had done all kinds of rituals and penances,

00:20:21.170 --> 00:20:23.970
you could not have got your Realisation.

00:20:24.130 --> 00:20:26.570
That would not have been possible.

00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:33.210
I knew this. That's why I have to work very hard,

00:20:33.370 --> 00:20:38.970
facing all kinds of problems, all kinds of turmoils,

00:20:39.130 --> 00:20:44.530
all kinds of pressures, what was the thing?

00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:51.530
Just to see that you all are created

00:20:51.690 --> 00:20:54.810
and you're all My hands.

00:20:54.970 --> 00:21:00.770
You have to work. Every finger has to work.

00:21:00.930 --> 00:21:03.770
And that is what I have been telling you,

00:21:03.930 --> 00:21:11.290
that now it is our responsibility to see that we become,

00:21:11.450 --> 00:21:18.450
not only Sahaja Yogis ourself, but blossoming time

00:21:18.690 --> 00:21:24.410
and many, many Sahaja Yogis we should have.

00:21:26.010 --> 00:21:30.690
It's a work of Adi Shakti.

00:21:30.850 --> 00:21:33.570
Try to understand this.

00:21:33.730 --> 00:21:37.530
It's not work of any saint.

00:21:37.690 --> 00:21:42.290
It's not work of any incarnation.

00:21:42.450 --> 00:21:46.330
It's not work of any politician.

00:21:46.490 --> 00:21:52.770
And not work of any big leader.

00:21:52.930 --> 00:21:56.970
It is the work of Adi Shakti,

00:21:57.170 --> 00:22:04.330
which is so transparently showing its results in you.

00:22:04.490 --> 00:22:10.370
Now it is for you to see.

00:22:11.850 --> 00:22:18.770
To please Me is your ardent desire, I know.

00:22:18.930 --> 00:22:28.450
I see how you love Me and how you want to do for Me.

00:22:28.610 --> 00:22:32.530
The greatest thing you can do for Me

00:22:32.690 --> 00:22:36.970
is to spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:22:37.530 --> 00:22:45.210
It is a very special, extremely difficult blessings you have got.

00:22:47.970 --> 00:22:51.410
You didn't have to do any efforts.

00:22:51.570 --> 00:22:55.650
You didn't have to pay any money.

00:22:56.450 --> 00:23:04.570
You don't have to get sick with rituals.

00:23:04.730 --> 00:23:08.770
You got it spontaneously.

00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:15.330
But that doesn't mean that it's sort of your birthright to get it.

00:23:15.490 --> 00:23:19.530
[It] is the work of Adi Shakti.

00:23:22.050 --> 00:23:31.770
And the work of Adi Shakti has to be shown in your life.

00:23:33.530 --> 00:23:41.810
[It] is the compassion, without any reward.

00:23:42.570 --> 00:23:45.890
People have tried to spread their religion

00:23:46.050 --> 00:23:49.730
by showing compassion to poor people,

00:23:49.890 --> 00:23:54.850
looking after the poor people, handicapped people.

00:23:55.930 --> 00:24:02.450
There's no need, actually, for Sahaja Yogis to do that.

00:24:03.570 --> 00:24:08.770
What they have to do is to transform other people.

00:24:09.050 --> 00:24:14.210
Find out ways and methods how you can transform,

00:24:14.530 --> 00:24:19.170
how you can spread the message of Adi Shakti.

00:24:19.530 --> 00:24:21.810
Put your mind to it

00:24:21.970 --> 00:24:26.490
and you will know how you can manage it.

00:24:29.970 --> 00:24:37.050
There should be all the time compelling desire

00:24:37.210 --> 00:24:40.050
that we have to find out method

00:24:40.210 --> 00:24:44.010
by which we can spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:24:44.930 --> 00:24:51.210
Otherwise it's like what Christ has described

00:24:51.370 --> 00:24:58.330
that some seed fell on the marshy land

00:24:58.890 --> 00:25:04.810
and they sprouted, but never grew.

00:25:05.130 --> 00:25:12.250
You can only grow in the real sense of the word

00:25:12.890 --> 00:25:19.170
and become something very, very special and real

00:25:20.130 --> 00:25:26.130
by knowing what you can do.

00:25:27.370 --> 00:25:30.370
I have a vision, no doubt,

00:25:30.530 --> 00:25:34.730
and I've been talking about it quite a lot,

00:25:35.010 --> 00:25:41.370
but it ends up with the puja is not a good thing.

00:25:42.170 --> 00:25:46.410
I know some countries are very difficult.

00:25:46.570 --> 00:25:50.650
Try to find out what is the problem,

00:25:50.810 --> 00:25:55.770
why it is so very difficult.

00:25:56.770 --> 00:26:02.010
Attention has to be paid to this,

00:26:02.170 --> 00:26:09.770
that what other human beings are doing to destroy themselves,

00:26:11.210 --> 00:26:14.450
as if it is the part and parcel of the same game

00:26:14.610 --> 00:26:19.370
which we call as the last judgement,

00:26:19.530 --> 00:26:23.210
but let us, through our compassion and love,

00:26:23.370 --> 00:26:26.330
save as many as possible.

00:26:27.850 --> 00:26:31.850
This is the work of Adi Shakti,

00:26:32.410 --> 00:26:37.250
not the work of any saint or any incarnation.

00:26:37.410 --> 00:26:40.010
They're all there, no doubt.

00:26:40.170 --> 00:26:45.090
They're all with us, all the time to help us,

00:26:45.250 --> 00:26:49.850
but you people have the power of Adi Shakti,

00:26:50.250 --> 00:26:53.690
which is very great,

00:26:53.850 --> 00:26:57.650
which is very penetrating,

00:26:57.810 --> 00:27:00.850
which is miraculous.

00:27:01.010 --> 00:27:04.290
It's so effective,

00:27:04.450 --> 00:27:10.410
but unless and until you become aware of your own powers,

00:27:10.570 --> 00:27:13.570
how will you work it out.

00:27:13.730 --> 00:27:19.130
It would be like a dead machine that has everything,

00:27:19.290 --> 00:27:23.490
but nobody is there to work it out.

00:27:23.690 --> 00:27:30.530
All the time I had to go through very,

00:27:30.690 --> 00:27:33.610
very hazardous times

00:27:33.770 --> 00:27:40.530
and sometimes I felt that I may have to take another birth,

00:27:40.690 --> 00:27:44.610
the way things are so difficult for Me.

00:27:44.770 --> 00:27:51.250
But now, for you, it has been very easy,

00:27:52.170 --> 00:27:57.370
as if the one who makes the road has to work very hard,

00:27:57.530 --> 00:27:59.970
but those who walk on that,

00:28:00.130 --> 00:28:05.290
they don't realise how easily they have got it.

00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:11.730
And if they realise this, then they will realise also

00:28:11.890 --> 00:28:14.890
'Let many walk on this road,

00:28:15.050 --> 00:28:17.570
which was created with such

00:28:17.730 --> 00:28:21.850
patience, understanding and love.'

00:28:22.010 --> 00:28:28.610
I have to really see you all Sahaja Yogis

00:28:28.770 --> 00:28:34.250
doing your level best to change this world

00:28:34.410 --> 00:28:36.410
— has to be changed.

00:28:36.570 --> 00:28:40.330
As it is, humanity has to be saved

00:28:40.490 --> 00:28:44.210
through you and nobody else.

00:28:44.930 --> 00:28:48.970
No president, no prime minister,

00:28:49.130 --> 00:28:51.410
no minister,

00:28:51.570 --> 00:28:55.370
none of these people can change the world

00:28:55.530 --> 00:28:57.290
and save it.

00:28:57.450 --> 00:29:00.370
It is you who are entitled.

00:29:00.530 --> 00:29:02.970
You have got this power.

00:29:03.170 --> 00:29:09.930
Do you realise your own status?

00:29:10.090 --> 00:29:14.730
Your own being?

00:29:14.890 --> 00:29:18.450
which has risen so high?

00:29:18.610 --> 00:29:24.490
It is not there. If that realisation is there,

00:29:24.650 --> 00:29:28.490
you would go all out

00:29:29.050 --> 00:29:35.610
to express your love and compassion to other people,

00:29:35.770 --> 00:29:41.010
to make them realise what they are.

00:29:41.170 --> 00:29:44.250
Only with Sahaja Yoga you can save this world.

00:29:44.410 --> 00:29:46.690
There's no other way out.

00:29:46.850 --> 00:29:53.570
Whatever you may try, say, to help the poor, to help this and that

00:29:53.730 --> 00:29:58.170
is something very, very superficial.

00:29:58.850 --> 00:30:06.450
Best thing is to give Realisation to every person you see.

00:30:08.090 --> 00:30:12.010
We have seen children. They're coming up.

00:30:12.170 --> 00:30:16.850
They'll be great Sahaja Yogis also. I can see that.

00:30:17.010 --> 00:30:23.090
But before them, you have to show your own merits

00:30:23.250 --> 00:30:26.130
of what you have done.

00:30:26.290 --> 00:30:29.210
It's not a static work.

00:30:29.370 --> 00:30:35.770
It's a big movement, which has to be really explosive

00:30:35.930 --> 00:30:45.290
and unless and until such a great step is taken,

00:30:49.690 --> 00:30:58.290
I don't know who will be blamed for the doomsday.

00:31:00.210 --> 00:31:05.650
You are the one[s] who have to build up

00:31:05.810 --> 00:31:09.410
the destiny of human beings.

00:31:09.570 --> 00:31:14.290
Don't consider as yourself, as something nothing.

00:31:14.450 --> 00:31:16.930
You could never have got your Realisation.

00:31:17.090 --> 00:31:19.170
You'd never have come to Me.

00:31:19.330 --> 00:31:23.650
Among so many, you are the ones who came to Me

00:31:23.810 --> 00:31:27.930
and who asked for Realisation and got it.

00:31:28.090 --> 00:31:31.010
You know it cannot be forced.

00:31:31.170 --> 00:31:34.810
This Realisation cannot be forced.

00:31:34.970 --> 00:31:38.130
This awareness cannot be forced.

00:31:38.290 --> 00:31:45.330
And the growthof this awareness also cannot be forced.

00:31:45.490 --> 00:31:51.890
You have to develop that attention deep down within yourself.

00:31:52.050 --> 00:31:56.490
And see for yourself what you have done,

00:31:56.650 --> 00:31:58.810
what you have done.

00:31:58.970 --> 00:32:05.210
If you are still busy with the money problem or the power problem

00:32:05.370 --> 00:32:09.770
and this problem and that, you are a problem.

00:32:09.930 --> 00:32:12.330
You are not a Sahaja Yogi.

00:32:12.490 --> 00:32:16.530
Sahaja Yogi is above everything else

00:32:16.690 --> 00:32:20.290
and is very powerful.

00:32:20.450 --> 00:32:25.010
Power will be achieved by them

00:32:25.170 --> 00:32:27.850
— power of love and compassion,

00:32:28.010 --> 00:32:32.250
which is not only words of love.

00:32:32.410 --> 00:32:38.010
It is not only act of loving others,

00:32:38.650 --> 00:32:47.370
but it is a powerful personality that you will have,

00:32:47.530 --> 00:32:50.970
which will just emit

00:32:51.130 --> 00:33:01.450
that great Divine Light and can capture people.

00:33:02.210 --> 00:33:13.090
All should just take a very brave personality.

00:33:14.450 --> 00:33:17.170
I must say people have improved,

00:33:17.330 --> 00:33:20.450
otherwise everybody used to write to Me:

00:33:20.610 --> 00:33:24.770
'This is wrong with me and that is wrong with my father.

00:33:24.930 --> 00:33:29.330
That is wrong with my great-grandmother' and all kinds of things.

00:33:29.490 --> 00:33:35.130
That is over now. Much less, I must say, much less.

00:33:35.850 --> 00:33:42.970
But instead of telling Me about people who are sick,

00:33:43.130 --> 00:33:46.490
people who have failed,

00:33:46.650 --> 00:33:54.450
people who are still in a state

00:33:55.090 --> 00:34:01.730
that cannot be improved, attention should be changed.

00:34:01.890 --> 00:34:08.010
If there's one person who has got cancer anywhere,

00:34:08.330 --> 00:34:12.250
immediately at least ten photographs will come to Me.

00:34:12.410 --> 00:34:15.850
Leader will write to Me. The wife's leader will write to Me.

00:34:16.010 --> 00:34:21.930
Everybody will write to Me that Mother, say such-and-such thing.

00:34:24.290 --> 00:34:30.570
Why? Is that My job?

00:34:30.730 --> 00:34:34.930
That person can be cured — we have hospitals —

00:34:35.090 --> 00:34:38.370
can be cured by photographs,

00:34:38.530 --> 00:34:43.690
but attention always goes now to compassion part.

00:34:43.850 --> 00:34:49.250
To those people who are so-called suffering physically,

00:34:49.410 --> 00:34:54.010
mentally, emotionally, financially,

00:34:54.210 --> 00:34:57.090
also in the marriages,

00:35:00.090 --> 00:35:03.090
that's not your job,

00:35:03.250 --> 00:35:06.050
neither Mine.

00:35:06.210 --> 00:35:10.370
If they're sick, they should take a photograph and work it out.

00:35:10.530 --> 00:35:14.970
If it doesn't work, that means that it doesn't deserve.

00:35:17.570 --> 00:35:24.810
There is no need for you to treat them and to work it out and,

00:35:24.970 --> 00:35:27.850
if it fails, to write to Me

00:35:28.010 --> 00:35:31.450
that 'Mother, such-and-such person is sick.'

00:35:31.610 --> 00:35:34.490
What's so important?

00:35:35.290 --> 00:35:41.330
Already we have so many healthy people going round.

00:35:41.490 --> 00:35:43.690
Why not use them first?

00:35:43.850 --> 00:35:48.010
Our job is not to cure people.

00:35:48.210 --> 00:35:53.050
Affection is all right. Compassion is all right. Is a natural thing

00:35:53.210 --> 00:35:59.930
that our attention goes to sick people or to the poor people

00:36:00.090 --> 00:36:04.570
or to the people who are suffering,

00:36:04.730 --> 00:36:10.010
but what about Sahaj Yog?

00:36:13.370 --> 00:36:16.650
If you have one sick person,

00:36:16.810 --> 00:36:20.930
hundred Sahaja Yogis will get after that.

00:36:21.090 --> 00:36:24.330
What is the reason?

00:36:24.490 --> 00:36:28.410
Is it compassion?

00:36:28.570 --> 00:36:30.770
It's not.

00:36:32.490 --> 00:36:39.050
They want to prove that they can cure that person.

00:36:40.010 --> 00:36:42.930
Is not compassion.

00:36:43.090 --> 00:36:46.370
Compassion today is

00:36:46.530 --> 00:36:52.890
to transform human beings into Sahajis,

00:36:53.290 --> 00:36:56.690
into good people.

00:36:56.850 --> 00:37:00.930
That is the love of Adi Shakti.

00:37:01.410 --> 00:37:05.170
Because those who are born have to die in any case.

00:37:05.330 --> 00:37:09.490
We should not be unkind, of course, but

00:37:09.650 --> 00:37:15.970
our attention should be how many people we are giving Realisation.

00:37:16.410 --> 00:37:19.370
Is a very common thing

00:37:19.530 --> 00:37:25.130
that people indulge more into so-called curing

00:37:25.290 --> 00:37:30.850
and improving and this. It's all right.

00:37:31.210 --> 00:37:36.410
Also there are problems like in the marriages, you see.

00:37:36.570 --> 00:37:39.850
Some marriage couple don't want to be there.

00:37:40.010 --> 00:37:43.450
It's all right. Finish them.

00:37:44.410 --> 00:37:48.570
If they don't want to live together, let them.

00:37:49.290 --> 00:37:53.010
We have many people who are sensible in this world,

00:37:53.170 --> 00:37:56.970
many people who are healthy in this world.

00:37:57.650 --> 00:38:00.490
Now how can you go on struggling with people

00:38:00.650 --> 00:38:04.530
who don't want to live together and have problems?

00:38:05.250 --> 00:38:07.810
That's not your job.

00:38:07.970 --> 00:38:11.050
First of all, you are a spiritual worker.

00:38:11.210 --> 00:38:14.370
You are not a social worker.

00:38:14.530 --> 00:38:16.090
Of course,

00:38:16.250 --> 00:38:21.610
by the way, you can do social work. It doesn't matter, by the way.

00:38:23.330 --> 00:38:29.370
But the main thing for you is to transform human beings.

00:38:30.050 --> 00:38:34.810
With that, the greatest disease

00:38:34.970 --> 00:38:40.650
is of meanness, of cruelty,

00:38:43.170 --> 00:38:48.770
of torturing others, anger.

00:38:49.730 --> 00:38:53.450
All these diseases can be cured,

00:38:53.610 --> 00:38:57.650
which are internal, not external.

00:38:58.090 --> 00:39:00.370
That is today wanted.

00:39:00.530 --> 00:39:04.530
Every country's fighting and is tortured

00:39:04.690 --> 00:39:11.850
and is in peril all the time of getting destroyed.

00:39:12.810 --> 00:39:18.130
The only way you can do it is to give them Realisation.

00:39:18.290 --> 00:39:22.890
Now what happens is to be seen very clearly

00:39:23.690 --> 00:39:29.130
that when you give Realisation to someone

00:39:29.290 --> 00:39:34.810
and he values it, and he grows into it,

00:39:35.010 --> 00:39:39.490
then you are protected.

00:39:39.650 --> 00:39:43.490
You are completely protected.

00:39:44.050 --> 00:39:47.850
Who protects you, you may say?

00:39:48.010 --> 00:39:50.930
The Adi Shakti, all right,

00:39:51.090 --> 00:39:58.730
but also there is a destructive power working in this world,

00:39:58.890 --> 00:40:05.570
not of negativity, but positive destructive power of Shiva.

00:40:06.130 --> 00:40:17.650
If He says that if Adi Shakti's work is going on well, He's happy.

00:40:17.930 --> 00:40:21.690
But He's sitting there and watching each and every person,

00:40:21.850 --> 00:40:25.530
each and every work of Sahaja Yogis

00:40:25.690 --> 00:40:34.010
and if He finds something really very wrong,

00:40:34.210 --> 00:40:37.770
I cannot control it.

00:40:38.010 --> 00:40:44.530
He destroys. I cannot go to that point.

00:40:45.330 --> 00:40:48.330
He destroys.

00:40:48.490 --> 00:40:56.210
Not only destroys, but thousands He can destroy.

00:40:59.970 --> 00:41:03.810
Anywhere there is a calamity,

00:41:03.970 --> 00:41:10.970
we can say, like an earthquake

00:41:11.130 --> 00:41:15.650
or some sort of a hurricane,

00:41:15.810 --> 00:41:17.650
all these things come

00:41:17.810 --> 00:41:25.690
through the working of Shri Mahadeva.

00:41:26.930 --> 00:41:30.290
I can't help you there,

00:41:30.730 --> 00:41:36.130
but if you really give Realisation to people,

00:41:37.850 --> 00:41:41.490
all these can be averted.

00:41:42.410 --> 00:41:48.450
Of course, it is the whim, I should say, of Adi Shakti

00:41:48.610 --> 00:41:53.010
that She started this work of creating this world,

00:41:53.170 --> 00:41:58.330
of creating you and making you Sahaja Yogis,

00:41:58.530 --> 00:42:02.850
but your responsibility is also very important.

00:42:06.050 --> 00:42:09.730
You cannot be responsible.

00:42:12.570 --> 00:42:22.450
Maybe it was, I felt, My responsibility, but there's a difference.

00:42:24.210 --> 00:42:28.650
I never felt it was My responsibility,

00:42:29.730 --> 00:42:33.610
never felt this was My job,

00:42:33.770 --> 00:42:36.850
never felt I have to do it.

00:42:37.010 --> 00:42:39.490
'I did it.'

00:42:42.850 --> 00:42:44.810
That is the work.

00:42:44.970 --> 00:42:49.250
That's the kind of personality you should have.

00:42:49.410 --> 00:42:55.290
You have to do it in a very humble manner,

00:42:57.410 --> 00:43:01.930
in a very beautiful manner

00:43:02.090 --> 00:43:07.250
and you'll be amazed to see how you are protected,

00:43:07.410 --> 00:43:13.930
how you are supported and how everything works out.

00:43:14.210 --> 00:43:17.810
The greatest joy you will get when you will find

00:43:17.970 --> 00:43:21.050
you can give Realisation to people.

00:43:22.730 --> 00:43:26.290
You can change their lives.

00:43:26.970 --> 00:43:29.290
Never you would feel such joy,

00:43:29.450 --> 00:43:37.410
even if you get, say, a big lottery maybe,

00:43:37.930 --> 00:43:41.850
a big job or a big name

00:43:42.010 --> 00:43:48.450
or a very big award, no.

00:43:49.410 --> 00:43:54.610
The joy of creating Sahaja Yogis

00:43:55.450 --> 00:44:00.290
knows no bounds,

00:44:00.890 --> 00:44:04.770
is such a joy-giving thing.

00:44:05.850 --> 00:44:10.850
You develop such fraternities,

00:44:11.010 --> 00:44:17.050
such solidarity, as they call it, such oneness,

00:44:17.450 --> 00:44:22.290
such enjoyment of love,

00:44:22.730 --> 00:44:25.930
enjoyment of compassion.

00:44:26.090 --> 00:44:29.890
It's a different level of enjoyment

00:44:30.050 --> 00:44:34.130
that's not like ordinary enjoyments.

00:44:36.450 --> 00:44:39.850
You're not to be afraid of Me,

00:44:40.010 --> 00:44:44.250
but be afraid of yourself.

00:44:44.410 --> 00:44:48.130
Have a watch on yourself and see for yourself

00:44:48.290 --> 00:44:51.850
what have you been doing so far.

00:44:52.010 --> 00:44:55.250
What have you done so far?

00:44:55.410 --> 00:45:01.730
Because you have been enlightened.

00:45:02.490 --> 00:45:05.450
If the enlightened people

00:45:05.610 --> 00:45:09.450
cannot give light, what's the use in having them?

00:45:09.610 --> 00:45:12.370
Look at these little, little candles.

00:45:12.530 --> 00:45:18.290
Whatever little light they have, they're giving that light.

00:45:18.450 --> 00:45:22.410
They're burning themselves to give that light.

00:45:22.570 --> 00:45:28.650
If we cannot give that light,

00:45:29.930 --> 00:45:34.210
what is the use of enlightenment?

00:45:35.370 --> 00:45:40.090
Enlightened doesn't mean the light for yourself only

00:45:40.250 --> 00:45:45.130
the light of love, compassion,

00:45:45.290 --> 00:45:52.010
which is divine, which is not normal, which is not ordinary,

00:45:52.170 --> 00:45:54.930
as you see in the films.

00:45:55.090 --> 00:46:00.450
It is a divine love which works

00:46:01.650 --> 00:46:06.690
and that is what makes Me sometimes little weak

00:46:06.850 --> 00:46:10.250
when I hear that Sahaja Yogis now

00:46:10.410 --> 00:46:14.970
are getting involved in money, in cheating.

00:46:15.130 --> 00:46:19.690
I mean, all kinds of criminal activities they do.

00:46:19.850 --> 00:46:23.610
I can't understand. I can't believe it.

00:46:23.770 --> 00:46:27.730
After getting the highest,

00:46:27.890 --> 00:46:33.730
why do you want to go so low as that?

00:46:33.890 --> 00:46:39.570
Because you have not yet felt what you have got.

00:46:41.130 --> 00:46:45.370
You have not realised what you have got.

00:46:47.570 --> 00:46:51.250
And you don't respect yourself.

00:46:51.650 --> 00:46:58.610
Still, if you are on the same line and the same level,

00:46:58.770 --> 00:47:09.490
I must say you have done no justice to Me or to yourself.

00:47:10.010 --> 00:47:13.570
We have to work it out.

00:47:13.730 --> 00:47:17.210
Single-handed, I've done it,

00:47:17.370 --> 00:47:20.970
worked very hard, I must say,

00:47:21.130 --> 00:47:28.290
in the sense that I had to deal with horrible people,

00:47:29.810 --> 00:47:37.010
very unkind, very selfish, very cruel.

00:47:37.770 --> 00:47:40.730
That doesn't matter.

00:47:43.130 --> 00:47:47.170
And such beautiful pearls I have discovered.

00:47:47.810 --> 00:47:52.490
But you must keep your lustre

00:47:52.650 --> 00:47:55.530
and work it out.

00:47:55.690 --> 00:48:02.570
I'll be very happy to know that Sahaja Yoga is spreading

00:48:02.730 --> 00:48:07.370
with leaps and bounds, with great speed

00:48:07.530 --> 00:48:11.250
and that people are really

00:48:11.410 --> 00:48:19.330
getting into that realm

00:48:19.850 --> 00:48:26.770
of peace, joy and happiness.

00:48:26.930 --> 00:48:29.730
That's My dream

00:48:29.890 --> 00:48:33.850
and I hope you all will all work it out.

00:48:34.290 --> 00:48:36.970
Thank you very much.
