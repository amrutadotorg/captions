1
00:05:54,954 --> 00:06:00,391
Hindi

2
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:04,696
I am sorry I was delayed.

3
00:06:04,886 --> 00:06:07,766
We were supposed to see the Collector and the

4
00:06:08,006 --> 00:06:10,286
Tahsildar, as they call him.

5
00:06:10,526 --> 00:06:13,686
They have done so much for us; so much they have organized,

6
00:06:13,886 --> 00:06:17,806
all the way, and officially they have done so well,

7
00:06:18,006 --> 00:06:22,766
that I had to wait for them to thank them very much.

8
00:06:23,806 --> 00:06:26,966
I think

9
00:06:27,566 --> 00:06:30,686
it's not very much hot for you, see the

10
00:06:30,926 --> 00:06:34,726
wind is blowing, can you imagine.

11
00:06:37,526 --> 00:06:43,846
And if you see, there's no, no leaves, leaves are not moving.

12
00:06:53,526 --> 00:06:56,766
You always used to go and sit in the sun,

13
00:06:56,966 --> 00:07:01,486
so now here it is, you'd better have some of it.

14
00:07:01,686 --> 00:07:06,406
I hope you all enjoyed your stay in Jabalpur

15
00:07:06,686 --> 00:07:09,206
and the visit to Jabalpur.

16
00:07:09,446 --> 00:07:13,286
It was quite interesting. Some people have not yet arrived.

17
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:18,366
I am sorry to say they haven't been able to arrive

18
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:22,046
from Bombay.

19
00:07:22,286 --> 00:07:26,566
I think they are more Bombayites, not from the foreign countries,

20
00:07:26,766 --> 00:07:30,646
but otherwise I think all of you are here.

21
00:07:30,886 --> 00:07:35,286
It's a very unusual thing to happen like this, you see,

22
00:07:35,525 --> 00:07:40,086
this My father built this house about eighty years back.

23
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:43,126
He was very imaginative and fond of guests,

24
00:07:43,326 --> 00:07:49,446
so he also put up guest bedrooms and guest bathrooms, such,

25
00:07:49,686 --> 00:07:53,806
and it was a hill station.

26
00:07:54,006 --> 00:07:58,246
Now of course, because of crowdedness very cold and a hill station

27
00:07:58,486 --> 00:08:01,646
so people used to come, his friends used to come from Nagpur,

28
00:08:01,846 --> 00:08:03,446
so he had made arrangements for them.

29
00:08:03,646 --> 00:08:06,566
There were no hotels or anything so they used to have -

30
00:08:06,766 --> 00:08:09,766
and the people of this place are extremely hospitable,

31
00:08:09,966 --> 00:08:12,406
very hospitable.

32
00:08:12,726 --> 00:08:17,006
So it was his idea that he should have a house here

33
00:08:17,286 --> 00:08:18,806
where his guests could be.

34
00:08:19,006 --> 00:08:21,246
His brother had a big house

35
00:08:21,446 --> 00:08:25,886
but it was joint and he couldn't receive his guests,

36
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:31,366
so he thought it's better to build a house here,

37
00:08:31,606 --> 00:08:34,926
and behind was a huge, big compound bigger than this,

38
00:08:35,126 --> 00:08:36,246
which I have seen.

39
00:08:36,446 --> 00:08:39,766
I was only four years of age when we went away from here,

40
00:08:39,966 --> 00:08:42,326
but I remember each and everything

41
00:08:42,766 --> 00:08:46,726
about this house, and everything about Chhindwara.

42
00:08:47,246 --> 00:08:53,366
And you know My memory is unusually, very, very sharp.

43
00:08:53,606 --> 00:08:58,846
I mean, I remember even My birth, it's to that extent.

44
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:08,726
But I never knew that there would be so many saints coming

45
00:09:08,966 --> 00:09:11,046
to visit this place of My birth.

46
00:09:11,286 --> 00:09:15,046
I never expected that there would be so many people

47
00:09:15,286 --> 00:09:17,806
who will take to Sahaja Yoga in My lifetime,

48
00:09:18,046 --> 00:09:20,966
because when I was born I found people were so blind.

49
00:09:21,206 --> 00:09:24,006
I thought, "How will I talk about Sahaja Yog? What will I do?

50
00:09:24,246 --> 00:09:26,686
How will it work out? It's very difficult."

51
00:09:26,926 --> 00:09:28,726
My father knew about My mission,

52
00:09:28,926 --> 00:09:31,126
and he told Me that "You'd better find out a way

53
00:09:31,326 --> 00:09:34,926
by which You can give Realization en masse.

54
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:36,566
That was important, because

55
00:09:36,766 --> 00:09:40,286
even if You give Realization one person, is of no use.

56
00:09:40,486 --> 00:09:42,046
Also You should not write anything,

57
00:09:42,246 --> 00:09:45,646
because You don't create another Bible, Gita, Koran,

58
00:09:45,846 --> 00:09:48,126
because books also bind them.

59
00:09:48,406 --> 00:09:52,686
So best thing is that You should take to...

60
00:09:53,286 --> 00:09:54,606
search of human beings,

61
00:09:54,806 --> 00:09:59,286
why they can't get it, their en masse Realization,

62
00:09:59,566 --> 00:10:02,206
because now You have come for that purpose."

63
00:10:02,446 --> 00:10:04,046
Somehow it worked it out,

64
00:10:04,286 --> 00:10:06,646
and really it was surprising, I was really,

65
00:10:06,886 --> 00:10:08,966
was not thinking to open Sahasrara,

66
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:14,806
but I was literally forced into it and it worked out.

67
00:10:15,726 --> 00:10:19,166
It's working out. You can see, all of you are here.

68
00:10:19,726 --> 00:10:24,526
It's very amazing thing that can happen to someone like this,

69
00:10:24,766 --> 00:10:26,326
that in the lifetime only,

70
00:10:26,566 --> 00:10:31,686
you have come here to see this birthplace of Mine.

71
00:10:31,926 --> 00:10:33,966
It was such, such vibrations

72
00:10:34,206 --> 00:10:38,046
that My Sahasrara became completely jammed with vibrations.

73
00:10:38,246 --> 00:10:42,886
So cool inside, and outside was so hot that I didn't know

74
00:10:43,126 --> 00:10:44,686
what was happening.

75
00:10:44,886 --> 00:10:48,686
So I'm happy all of you could come and see this place,

76
00:10:48,926 --> 00:10:51,086
and a very humble house it was,

77
00:10:51,286 --> 00:10:54,446
but in those days it was the most,

78
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:58,246
I mean, well-planned house as such,

79
00:10:58,486 --> 00:11:01,406
and was very much appreciated by people.

80
00:11:01,646 --> 00:11:05,806
And after that four years I was here,

81
00:11:06,606 --> 00:11:12,046
and then we went to Nagpur because we had a,

82
00:11:12,286 --> 00:11:14,126
My father had a big practice in Nagpur,

83
00:11:14,326 --> 00:11:16,206
he had to go many times down,

84
00:11:16,406 --> 00:11:18,366
so they thought it's better to go.

85
00:11:18,606 --> 00:11:20,806
There also he had many houses,

86
00:11:21,046 --> 00:11:25,166
and Babamama is going to take you round to see those houses.

87
00:11:25,366 --> 00:11:30,086
He says he'll find out time to see wherever I have lived.

88
00:11:30,886 --> 00:11:34,006
But Nagpur also is very vibrated place, you can feel it.

89
00:11:34,206 --> 00:11:38,566
People are very quiet, it's a very quiet place.

90
00:11:39,006 --> 00:11:42,406
So this is a very novel thing,

91
00:11:42,606 --> 00:11:45,126
I don't think it has happened in the lifetime of

92
00:11:45,366 --> 00:11:48,966
any one of the incarnations who came on this earth.

93
00:11:49,206 --> 00:11:52,006
Even for Rama Janma Bhoomi we are fighting even today.

94
00:11:52,246 --> 00:11:53,525
So you can imagine.

95
00:11:53,726 --> 00:11:58,166
Thank God, we have got this place - in a way. It's not yet ours,

96
00:11:58,366 --> 00:11:59,966
but in a way we are there,

97
00:12:00,246 --> 00:12:05,966
and maybe with your good wishes we'll own it very soon.

98
00:12:08,046 --> 00:12:10,486
Today's puja I thought was best to have

99
00:12:10,686 --> 00:12:13,646
Shri Ganesha Puja in a short way,

100
00:12:13,846 --> 00:12:17,446
because the first Puja here, and I was born here,

101
00:12:17,646 --> 00:12:20,446
so it's better that we should have a Ganesha Puja.

102
00:12:20,686 --> 00:12:24,486
It would be a nice thing to start with,

103
00:12:24,766 --> 00:12:26,846
and I, we have a doctor here.

104
00:12:27,086 --> 00:12:29,726
They are all Sahaja Yogis and they are going to help us

105
00:12:29,966 --> 00:12:32,886
to do the curing. Actually I always thought,

106
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:35,726
"Which is the place where people will get cured?"

107
00:12:35,926 --> 00:12:40,366
So now we'll send all of them here to get cured.

108
00:12:41,726 --> 00:12:43,246
It's a, it was a jungle here.

109
00:12:43,446 --> 00:12:45,766
All around was jungles, hills,

110
00:12:45,966 --> 00:12:48,526
but I think all that's finished and broken now.

111
00:12:48,766 --> 00:12:53,246
And we used to get tigers and things;

112
00:12:53,446 --> 00:12:56,086
little far away from here is a place called Tamiya

113
00:12:56,286 --> 00:12:58,966
where they could go see tigers,

114
00:12:59,606 --> 00:13:02,366
but now they are there no doubt,

115
00:13:02,566 --> 00:13:07,326
but they are saying that nobody is now going that side,

116
00:13:07,526 --> 00:13:10,286
they all go to some preserve places

117
00:13:10,486 --> 00:13:13,086
which you have seen yourself, also Kanha Kisli.

118
00:13:13,406 --> 00:13:18,046
I hope you enjoyed. How did you enjoy Kanha Kisli?

119
00:13:20,766 --> 00:13:24,686
And the River Narmada also I was told you enjoyed very much.

120
00:13:24,886 --> 00:13:27,126
I am happy this has happened.

121
00:13:27,326 --> 00:13:30,926
It was a little circuitous and quite

122
00:13:33,086 --> 00:13:36,166
different from all the tours we have had so far,

123
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:41,326
but I am happy you all have enjoyed it.

124
00:13:49,326 --> 00:13:51,406
I have said so many things about Shri Ganesh,

125
00:13:51,646 --> 00:13:54,046
I don't know what to say now, anymore,

126
00:13:54,286 --> 00:13:58,126
but all of you have seen that, a place, now see the -

127
00:13:58,366 --> 00:14:02,206
this breeze is coming from where? I don't know.

128
00:14:02,486 --> 00:14:06,806
You are sending breeze to Me, instead of I doing it.

129
00:14:07,006 --> 00:14:08,526
All right.

130
00:14:14,366 --> 00:14:19,926
