AI GENERATED. Tinder of the camera.

1
00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.639
Um,

2
00:00:05.659 --> 00:00:07.429
and that's the only way we can actually show it.

3
00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:10.119
Because it's recorded on the,

4
00:00:10.159 --> 00:00:11.350
the English system

5
00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:13.069
from the television.

6
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:16.790
So if you wish you can show it to you.

7
00:00:22.959 --> 00:00:23.319
Only on the system you've got in fact

8
00:00:23.319 --> 00:00:25.569
we were getting tapes from the television station.

9
00:00:25.799 --> 00:00:27.829
Will they give us a tape from the television.

10
00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:34.959
So that's I think I've done a good job.

11
00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:36.270
Oh yes.

12
00:00:39.099 --> 00:00:40.650
Because it deflected him so much,

13
00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.419
he came with a direct question and then it just turned right around.

14
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.819
I have to tell him what to do,

15
00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:49.619
he was so he was quite a character.

16
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.500
Yes,

17
00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:52.939
he talked of himself.

18
00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:02.919
It's very direct.

19
00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:03.490
He asked me,

20
00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.010
very direct person doesn't matter.

21
00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:08.269
I said I better give him a diary answer.

22
00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:10.300
So

23
00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:14.220
This is like the socket.

24
00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:18.080
Uh,

25
00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.040
and it worked,

26
00:01:19.089 --> 00:01:19.480
you see,

27
00:01:19.489 --> 00:01:19.809
the,

28
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.110
it's nice you asked me such a direct question.

29
00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.400
I come to say things also.

30
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.800
It's a very good lesson,

31
00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.230
how to handle a man like that.

32
00:01:29.279 --> 00:01:30.959
It was a very good lesson to us

33
00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:32.430
on how to

34
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:34.949
handle that sort of situation

35
00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.550
because he was very direct and very awkward,

36
00:01:38.199 --> 00:01:40.480
and yet you continued by saying what you wanted to

37
00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.680
say and not responding to what he was saying.

38
00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.370
You continued by saying what you wanted.

39
00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.290
Instead of responding to his negative.

40
00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.550
Approach,

41
00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.629
very good.

42
00:01:52.129 --> 00:01:52.949
I do

43
00:01:53.449 --> 00:01:54.760
but not straightforward man.

44
00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.819
Because she said you,

45
00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.809
you could be a fraud fraud yourself.

46
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.288
I said I cannot because I'm the one who want

47
00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.220
everyone

48
00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.179
against them.

49
00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:14.860
And he,

50
00:02:14.889 --> 00:02:15.850
he got confused,

51
00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:16.449
you see

52
00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.820
your divide means are you like a child,

53
00:02:18.899 --> 00:02:19.369
he said.

54
00:02:20.929 --> 00:02:21.910
I think for the

55
00:02:22.669 --> 00:02:23.309
child like.

56
00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.979
This is so obvious if you see the newspaper thing

57
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.210
like this child being saved,

58
00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.729
you know,

59
00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.410
that boy was saved and all.

60
00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:41.699
They're in the newspaper,

61
00:02:41.779 --> 00:02:42.940
so they don't want to know it.

62
00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:44.270
So what can you do about it?

63
00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:45.740
They don't want to know about it.

64
00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.660
And you mentioned about the Kundalini rising and coming.

65
00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:50.490
the top of the triggers for the seekers

66
00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.979
all those little keys that the seekers will know

67
00:02:59.979 --> 00:03:02.070
is correct even ordinary person will see the,

68
00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:05.559
you see people just not only the person who's interviewed,

69
00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.070
but also the interviewer.

70
00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:12.089
What sort of attitude did yours take?

71
00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.309
Really funny I had to do.

72
00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.149
James liked it very much.

73
00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.639
Yeah,

74
00:03:28.649 --> 00:03:28.720
I was really composed.

75
00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:30.199
I just love the way that it was always.

76
00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.440
we would sort of come in

77
00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.889
very well

78
00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:46.050
here in all the programmes rather

79
00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:56.169
about money also I said that they don't want me to pay for their salvation.

80
00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:59.669
That yes yeah.

81
00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:04.160
Didn't seem to realise that it didn't have to pay any money.

82
00:04:09.279 --> 00:04:10.259
But just about it,

83
00:04:10.369 --> 00:04:10.610
you know,

84
00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.110
people have no sense of group in

85
00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:14.690
just Western countries.

86
00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:16.540
And it said

87
00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:17.920
that if your guru

88
00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:21.059
is dependent on you,

89
00:04:22.048 --> 00:04:23.799
then you must feed the guru,

90
00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.100
must try to give all the comfort,

91
00:04:26.429 --> 00:04:27.559
everything that is possible.

92
00:04:28.489 --> 00:04:29.309
I make him

93
00:04:29.989 --> 00:04:30.760
or I

94
00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.899
look after him.

95
00:04:33.089 --> 00:04:33.709
That's the point,

96
00:04:34.489 --> 00:04:35.640
very respectfully,

97
00:04:38.119 --> 00:04:39.720
but also he said that

98
00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:42.600
we must give some duction with the.

99
00:04:44.119 --> 00:04:45.440
In the that.

100
00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:46.149
You see

101
00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.950
Something.

102
00:04:53.089 --> 00:04:54.200
For his uh.

103
00:04:57.549 --> 00:04:58.799
Yeah we see somebody absolutely dependent,

104
00:04:58.929 --> 00:04:59.260
OK.

105
00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:03.799
Then you can give him some Doxina like a present,

106
00:05:05.019 --> 00:05:05.609
how can you.

107
00:05:06.929 --> 00:05:08.140
But not that

108
00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.709
you collect the guru

109
00:05:11.929 --> 00:05:12.899
to take all your money,

110
00:05:13.459 --> 00:05:14.600
everything from you,

111
00:05:14.859 --> 00:05:16.929
may rob you completely

112
00:05:17.329 --> 00:05:19.149
buy those boys,

113
00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.809
you know,

114
00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:20.859
but this is that

115
00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.859
so far in India,

116
00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:27.459
suppose I go to I think it's a great thing that I want.

117
00:05:27.579 --> 00:05:29.489
I mean for them it's very fortunate.

118
00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:31.230
Then

119
00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.839
They might give me a sadi or something at the present.

120
00:05:38.089 --> 00:05:38.970
While the food.

121
00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:41.010
I invite others on that day.

122
00:05:41.019 --> 00:05:43.339
Mother is coming to my house to come and have food.

123
00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:46.899
That is

124
00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:48.779
the minimum you should do for your guru,

125
00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.510
but never said that said that

126
00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:54.260
the guru will never accept it.

127
00:05:55.059 --> 00:05:57.459
I see to give me usually sar is also so difficult,

128
00:05:57.559 --> 00:05:58.649
you know that I don't think

129
00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:00.339
it's an expensive present.

130
00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:01.209
I don't take.

131
00:06:01.269 --> 00:06:01.470
I mean

132
00:06:02.019 --> 00:06:02.660
I myself so to.

133
00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:04.820
You can't give that.

134
00:06:05.609 --> 00:06:06.510
But as a

135
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:08.549
means of,

136
00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:08.890
I mean,

137
00:06:09.079 --> 00:06:11.390
the only way you can express

138
00:06:12.059 --> 00:06:13.869
your love is through your flowers,

139
00:06:14.799 --> 00:06:16.890
not through something that you want to keep.

140
00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:18.700
It's a little little things you can do.

141
00:06:19.079 --> 00:06:21.109
There's no harm supposing you give me something,

142
00:06:21.239 --> 00:06:23.720
but you know I return doubly whatever you give me

143
00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:25.779
that I do,

144
00:06:25.799 --> 00:06:27.029
not others don't do,

145
00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:28.760
but I do it because I'm a mother.

146
00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:32.730
Feeling very hot

147
00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:38.829
Yeah.

148
00:06:40.559 --> 00:06:43.010
And since uh when I'll be travelling to India.

149
00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:45.420
Then yes.

150
00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.220
And before that when I came here

151
00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:53.440
when all CP paid I think last time you people paid for my family.

152
00:06:57.269 --> 00:06:57.279
No,

153
00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:57.369
you people treat me for my travelling,

154
00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:04.829
but I had to buy another ticket because I went down at 4,

155
00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:07.350
but in any case you can

156
00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:13.489
many times,

157
00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:14.160
you see,

158
00:07:15.589 --> 00:07:17.059
I don't count it to some,

159
00:07:17.579 --> 00:07:20.239
but you should pay that all this and self respect for my child.

160
00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:27.200
But sometimes it doesn't happen so many times when I repo my car so many times,

161
00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:28.029
isn't it?

162
00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:28.380
Yeah,

163
00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:29.140
that's for that.

164
00:07:30.399 --> 00:07:31.750
I mean so many travel together.

165
00:07:32.679 --> 00:07:33.690
I don't think

166
00:07:34.959 --> 00:07:35.369
That's great.

167
00:07:36.079 --> 00:07:37.790
Every time you pay to me.

168
00:07:38.609 --> 00:07:38.640
So we have,

169
00:07:38.649 --> 00:07:38.700
isn't it?

170
00:07:45.709 --> 00:07:47.769
Sometimes you just buy ticket force me to

171
00:07:48.519 --> 00:07:49.519
not to pay some time,

172
00:07:49.529 --> 00:07:50.309
but mostly

173
00:07:55.269 --> 00:07:55.339
wherever we go so many times.

174
00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:55.720
I mean how can you,

175
00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:58.549
how can we expect you to pay for our salvation and that's

176
00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:03.899
even they are travelling with me in the car so many times I paid for them,

177
00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:05.750
but it's not that because.

178
00:08:06.589 --> 00:08:07.489
It's not to be seen,

179
00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:08.660
but should not be done.

180
00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:09.459
That's not good.

181
00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:11.059
It should not be done,

182
00:08:11.089 --> 00:08:14.000
that you should make your go to pay for your travelling.

183
00:08:14.579 --> 00:08:17.769
That's too much and then for your food and for everything.

184
00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:20.450
We have had horrible people back on

185
00:08:24.859 --> 00:08:24.910
Peter appears.

186
00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:24.950
I was just,

187
00:08:24.959 --> 00:08:28.390
he borrowed 2000 pounds from CP and never returned it.

188
00:08:29.869 --> 00:08:30.869
We have had horrible people.

189
00:08:32.179 --> 00:08:34.308
I mean that way many have done many things like

190
00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:35.190
these,

191
00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:35.590
uh,

192
00:08:35.599 --> 00:08:36.909
people in Europe.

193
00:08:37.808 --> 00:08:38.169
In

194
00:08:38.929 --> 00:08:39.830
Portugal,

195
00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:40.840
what they did.

196
00:08:41.469 --> 00:08:41.479
that

197
00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:45.690
many people know that.

198
00:08:45.859 --> 00:08:47.059
I don't even know it properly.

199
00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:47.690
It's,

200
00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:48.840
it's so high-handed.

201
00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:49.849
I couldn't believe it.

202
00:08:49.979 --> 00:08:55.179
My ears went switched off the ceramics because I was involved at

203
00:08:55.179 --> 00:08:57.979
the beginning and I saw the things disappear into the depth of

204
00:08:57.979 --> 00:09:01.859
the night and I saw you giving thousands of thousands of francs

205
00:09:01.859 --> 00:09:04.690
to these boys and then I heard the end of the story.

206
00:09:06.159 --> 00:09:08.099
And I couldn't believe what happened in between.

207
00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:09.289
See,

208
00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:13.309
That story was like this.

209
00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:16.270
These 2 or 3 boys met me

210
00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:17.719
in Portugal,

211
00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:19.510
and they got their realisation,

212
00:09:19.599 --> 00:09:20.229
all right,

213
00:09:21.559 --> 00:09:22.929
so they told me that

214
00:09:23.359 --> 00:09:25.640
we want to start a ceramic centre

215
00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:26.229
here.

216
00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:28.130
Andor you that

217
00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:32.960
And this boy had a big huge place

218
00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:34.400
a little away from.

219
00:09:35.619 --> 00:09:36.260
I do.

220
00:09:37.479 --> 00:09:37.989
About

221
00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:40.619
10 miles away

222
00:09:40.869 --> 00:09:42.489
which he could use he said

223
00:09:42.929 --> 00:09:44.239
actually he showed me that.

224
00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:46.539
But

225
00:09:48.169 --> 00:09:49.799
They haven't got any

226
00:09:50.239 --> 00:09:51.330
cynamics with that.

227
00:09:53.359 --> 00:09:53.840
But

228
00:09:54.669 --> 00:09:55.460
They said that

229
00:09:56.349 --> 00:09:57.229
If you have

230
00:09:58.239 --> 00:10:00.630
If you give us some Indian ceramics,

231
00:10:01.039 --> 00:10:03.190
then we can hold an exhibition.

232
00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:06.750
And invite people and then talk of er.

233
00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:09.190
I said,

234
00:10:09.229 --> 00:10:09.739
all right.

235
00:10:10.849 --> 00:10:11.109
I

236
00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:13.549
So they came to London.

237
00:10:13.559 --> 00:10:14.729
They saw the ceramics I have.

238
00:10:15.979 --> 00:10:18.289
They send all of these with to us.

239
00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:20.260
So I said,

240
00:10:20.289 --> 00:10:20.849
all right,

241
00:10:21.049 --> 00:10:22.799
and we packed up they were about

242
00:10:23.049 --> 00:10:25.849
this house full of ceramics I have very expensive

243
00:10:26.239 --> 00:10:26.250
one.

244
00:10:27.109 --> 00:10:30.270
All that we put in a truck sent it we paid 500.

245
00:10:31.169 --> 00:10:31.989
Pounds

246
00:10:32.409 --> 00:10:33.799
for that shifting

247
00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:35.840
and for the customs and

248
00:10:38.179 --> 00:10:39.440
customs and everything.

249
00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:41.590
And went

250
00:10:41.859 --> 00:10:42.700
at least there.

251
00:10:43.599 --> 00:10:43.609
Mhm

252
00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:45.799
And they said

253
00:10:46.289 --> 00:10:47.190
one day the boy came,

254
00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:52.210
one of the wearing a very nice suit and this and that with the camera jumping here and

255
00:10:52.489 --> 00:10:53.450
there on the airport.

256
00:10:53.530 --> 00:10:53.770
I said,

257
00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:54.609
how who's this?

258
00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:56.039
I couldn't recognise it.

259
00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:57.429
First of,

260
00:10:57.479 --> 00:10:58.520
I'm so and so.

261
00:11:00.419 --> 00:11:01.020
So

262
00:11:01.309 --> 00:11:01.549
I said,

263
00:11:01.599 --> 00:11:02.659
what are you doing here?

264
00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:03.299
I said,

265
00:11:03.429 --> 00:11:04.909
have you not appointed me.

266
00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:08.830
I'm the director of the Sergio Enterprise.

267
00:11:08.869 --> 00:11:09.500
I said what?

268
00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:11.950
Director of the soldier went to pri,

269
00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:13.150
what's that?

270
00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:16.809
She said we have started a shop.

271
00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:19.289
They showed all that to a bank.

272
00:11:20.419 --> 00:11:21.479
Around that guarantee,

273
00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:24.000
the bank gave them 4000 pounds or so.

274
00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:26.270
They took a shop,

275
00:11:26.479 --> 00:11:27.799
put all these things for sale.

276
00:11:29.479 --> 00:11:30.229
I,

277
00:11:30.599 --> 00:11:31.469
whatever they sold,

278
00:11:31.559 --> 00:11:33.520
they use that money for their own purpose.

279
00:11:35.450 --> 00:11:38.460
So ultimately I said you better surrender the shop,

280
00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:39.960
return the money to the bank.

281
00:11:41.099 --> 00:11:41.599
It's got.

282
00:11:43.119 --> 00:11:44.109
It's incredible moment,

283
00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:44.919
absolutely.

284
00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:46.359
No,

285
00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:46.640
no,

286
00:11:46.679 --> 00:11:49.549
it was a big problem because we had seen on this one.

287
00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:54.140
I do a precious things I had.

288
00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:55.090
So,

289
00:11:57.570 --> 00:12:00.219
I didn't know what to do before CP was a big problem,

290
00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:00.479
sir.

291
00:12:01.669 --> 00:12:01.960
So I,

292
00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.159
when I went to Portugal,

293
00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:04.799
I gave them 300 pounds.

294
00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:05.190
I said,

295
00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:06.309
you buy something

296
00:12:06.799 --> 00:12:09.250
and I'll bring it with you to London when you come.

297
00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:11.289
So that

298
00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:13.739
I'll say it was the exchange for Portuguese

299
00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:16.460
ceramics if he doesn't know the prices or not,

300
00:12:17.489 --> 00:12:18.799
so they brought one dog,

301
00:12:19.049 --> 00:12:19.809
one cat,

302
00:12:19.929 --> 00:12:20.429
one.

303
00:12:22.049 --> 00:12:22.059
Oh.

304
00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:28.440
Yeah.

305
00:12:34.099 --> 00:12:34.190
When

306
00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:35.750
I

307
00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:37.609
How to man.

308
00:12:38.609 --> 00:12:39.469
I'll be laughing.

309
00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:47.830
Even now people take advantage.

310
00:12:49.359 --> 00:12:50.409
It's uh

311
00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:51.650
my wife.

312
00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:54.109
I say she

313
00:12:55.799 --> 00:12:58.200
She she wanted to get some Indian stuff,

314
00:12:58.239 --> 00:12:58.559
you see,

315
00:12:58.640 --> 00:12:59.880
masalas this that.

316
00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:02.390
So she wrote to her mother.

317
00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:05.409
I such a big box,

318
00:13:05.469 --> 00:13:06.289
wooden box came.

319
00:13:07.479 --> 00:13:10.020
But you see shipping corporation because CP has worked there

320
00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:11.929
for I mean it has built the whole thing,

321
00:13:12.190 --> 00:13:12.950
so we are allowed,

322
00:13:12.989 --> 00:13:13.950
we are privileged.

323
00:13:14.739 --> 00:13:16.169
And also under law,

324
00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:19.330
whatever things come to us can come free.

325
00:13:19.849 --> 00:13:21.840
He brought and put his box with.

326
00:13:23.599 --> 00:13:24.609
You know last time,

327
00:13:26.469 --> 00:13:27.789
When I was in India,

328
00:13:28.239 --> 00:13:29.109
she she wrote to me.

329
00:13:30.229 --> 00:13:30.239
We

330
00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:32.650
one carpet of the side.

331
00:13:33.950 --> 00:13:35.140
We need it very badly.

332
00:13:36.219 --> 00:13:37.969
But I had exhausted his money in the bank.

333
00:13:39.599 --> 00:13:39.960
I was done for that.

334
00:13:40.859 --> 00:13:42.520
I said now what to tell you,

335
00:13:43.119 --> 00:13:44.369
but I said let's say the back.

336
00:13:45.309 --> 00:13:46.369
And luckily in the bank,

337
00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:47.580
the money was there somehow.

338
00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:48.320
I don't know how for the carpet,

339
00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:51.510
so I bought the carpet.

340
00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:54.859
And the carpet was to come with all other

341
00:13:54.859 --> 00:13:57.190
things that were coming because when I'm in India.

342
00:13:58.119 --> 00:13:59.429
Whatever things I use,

343
00:14:00.359 --> 00:14:02.880
then they all have to come and they can only come by ship because.

344
00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:06.929
In that,

345
00:14:07.219 --> 00:14:08.570
I think there are 70s,

346
00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:09.619
I was 7.

347
00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:13.700
Things of mine

348
00:14:14.109 --> 00:14:15.539
and she put her 8 things.

349
00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:19.000
So when all the things came,

350
00:14:19.489 --> 00:14:22.090
they gave us 7 things and she delivered a 7 things.

351
00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:24.789
And when we opened the box.

352
00:14:25.609 --> 00:14:27.000
I thought it is in the box.

353
00:14:27.159 --> 00:14:29.729
We found all kinds of dirty clothes.

354
00:14:30.119 --> 00:14:30.159
See,

355
00:14:30.239 --> 00:14:31.830
we started looking at it,

356
00:14:32.669 --> 00:14:33.190
so this junk.

357
00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:35.840
I couldn't understand.

358
00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:36.080
He said,

359
00:14:36.219 --> 00:14:37.419
Throw away all this nonsense,

360
00:14:37.599 --> 00:14:40.330
but 34 dirty clothes we threw away.

361
00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:41.539
We didn't know it belonged to me

362
00:14:43.070 --> 00:14:44.549
and such filth inside

363
00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:47.369
and there was no carpeting.

364
00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:54.849
And we lost the pocket and it smelled like a Bombay d Bombay dried fish.

365
00:14:56.820 --> 00:14:56.830
Yeah.

366
00:14:59.169 --> 00:15:01.059
And the car was missing.

367
00:15:01.299 --> 00:15:02.820
That's a big joke where is the car?

368
00:15:04.299 --> 00:15:05.950
They said we delivered you

369
00:15:06.479 --> 00:15:09.090
8 1817

370
00:15:09.719 --> 00:15:11.789
and at that time you should have told us

371
00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:13.309
that this missing.

372
00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:15.880
We thought the carpet must be in this wooden box,

373
00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:16.359
you see.

374
00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:20.479
How are we to know that Minoxi Day's big box is coming?

375
00:15:22.849 --> 00:15:23.799
I thought,

376
00:15:24.450 --> 00:15:24.520
but

377
00:15:24.859 --> 00:15:25.760
she told me

378
00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:27.770
there's a small box coming,

379
00:15:27.849 --> 00:15:29.840
so I thought must have put in one of the boxes,

380
00:15:29.890 --> 00:15:30.409
you see,

381
00:15:32.450 --> 00:15:32.520
I it might be coming with it.

382
00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:34.460
No.

383
00:15:35.890 --> 00:15:35.900
But

384
00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:38.780
They

385
00:15:39.109 --> 00:15:39.270
told,

386
00:15:39.349 --> 00:15:41.119
they said no you can't find the carpet,

387
00:15:41.130 --> 00:15:42.789
it's in your house is that.

388
00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:46.630
The drunk girl must have got CP some 1000 I.

389
00:15:48.599 --> 00:15:49.479
Because he got right,

390
00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:50.599
it was an expensive,

391
00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:53.200
about 50 ₹50,000 you see.

392
00:15:54.530 --> 00:15:57.859
of $5000

393
00:15:58.210 --> 00:15:59.400
5000 dollars.

394
00:16:01.289 --> 00:16:03.450
So he telephoned here and he telephoned there.

395
00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:04.630
They telephoned us.

396
00:16:04.729 --> 00:16:08.140
The whole office was went to who is this Meenakshi

397
00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:11.000
and why and this thing gone and all that,

398
00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:11.880
and you know,

399
00:16:11.890 --> 00:16:15.159
the king started saying that they are these jogis are using

400
00:16:15.489 --> 00:16:16.640
mother's privilege.

401
00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:19.500
It's a very bad name for us because we have been very,

402
00:16:19.530 --> 00:16:21.090
very sensible people all over that.

403
00:16:21.169 --> 00:16:21.570
Yes.

404
00:16:22.429 --> 00:16:23.890
And the carpet was lost.

405
00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:26.000
And CP said that's gone.

406
00:16:26.039 --> 00:16:27.590
I think we'll never get it back.

407
00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:30.119
But the chairman is so particular on CP's things.

408
00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:30.530
He said,

409
00:16:30.539 --> 00:16:33.000
How can you lose his carpet that I'm not.

410
00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:34.559
I'll sack the captain.

411
00:16:35.830 --> 00:16:36.989
all things worked out

412
00:16:37.229 --> 00:16:39.049
and now when I was

413
00:16:39.510 --> 00:16:40.070
in New York,

414
00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:41.219
I think he told me,

415
00:16:41.429 --> 00:16:45.210
or later on he telephoned to me in Los Angeles and said we found the car.

416
00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:56.450
So what to do?

417
00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:00.710
Even

418
00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:02.969
This time when you people came,

419
00:17:03.059 --> 00:17:04.459
7 people did not pay me.

420
00:17:05.588 --> 00:17:06.398
In New York.

421
00:17:06.489 --> 00:17:07.159
In India.

422
00:17:08.098 --> 00:17:09.538
Two Americans who came,

423
00:17:10.208 --> 00:17:12.688
they didn't pay me for their food or for travelling,

424
00:17:13.088 --> 00:17:15.638
but they incurred also a.

425
00:17:16.048 --> 00:17:16.568
Um.

426
00:17:17.848 --> 00:17:20.800
Loan of about ₹6000 which I paid.

427
00:17:22.608 --> 00:17:24.489
They took that money you made to Kashmir.

428
00:17:24.608 --> 00:17:26.280
This is Michael and Roger.

429
00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:35.300
What

430
00:17:39.959 --> 00:17:41.680
Two of them ran away too,

431
00:17:42.439 --> 00:17:42.849
huh.

432
00:17:43.550 --> 00:17:44.479
I must tell you,

433
00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:46.829
those two persons who came from Austria

434
00:17:47.290 --> 00:17:47.829
met

435
00:17:50.359 --> 00:17:52.150
her Betty surprising.

436
00:17:54.219 --> 00:17:54.890
But no money,

437
00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:55.300
mother.

438
00:17:55.819 --> 00:17:57.500
And I bet you said it was a horrid place.

439
00:17:57.579 --> 00:17:58.050
I went there,

440
00:17:58.119 --> 00:17:59.369
I saw this and all that.

441
00:17:59.540 --> 00:17:59.939
Oh really?

442
00:18:00.739 --> 00:18:00.780
She saw them in

443
00:18:03.010 --> 00:18:04.819
in the place in in

444
00:18:06.479 --> 00:18:07.160
Kathmandu.

445
00:18:07.810 --> 00:18:08.849
She met them there.

446
00:18:10.479 --> 00:18:12.459
I don't know how they meant that I should have,

447
00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:15.709
I didn't have their address.

448
00:18:15.790 --> 00:18:16.630
They sent me a letter.

449
00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:18.859
She would have been going back through

450
00:18:19.069 --> 00:18:19.630
Delhi

451
00:18:20.469 --> 00:18:21.699
to back to America.

452
00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:25.709
He wanted to have a holiday.

453
00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:28.300
They had a holiday,

454
00:18:28.469 --> 00:18:30.099
so they thought they'll go to Bangkok,

455
00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:32.260
but Bangkok was hurried,

456
00:18:32.469 --> 00:18:33.859
so they went to Nepal

457
00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:36.140
and in Nepal they found these people.

458
00:18:37.839 --> 00:18:39.859
Imagine how she met them I didn't ask her.

459
00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:43.989
She knew nothing about it either,

460
00:18:44.109 --> 00:18:44.270
Mother.

461
00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:47.449
She wasn't in so she wouldn't know anything about it.

462
00:18:47.550 --> 00:18:48.229
But in any case,

463
00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:48.469
I mean,

464
00:18:48.550 --> 00:18:49.390
I'm not going to ask them.

465
00:18:49.469 --> 00:18:51.780
I never ask Michael or Roger anything about it,

466
00:18:51.790 --> 00:18:52.630
so forget it.

467
00:18:52.670 --> 00:18:53.140
Yeah.

468
00:18:53.550 --> 00:18:53.949
Oh yes,

469
00:18:54.030 --> 00:18:54.900
it's finished.

470
00:18:57.680 --> 00:19:00.819
And that Michael was fighting with um John.

471
00:19:05.729 --> 00:19:05.739
Really?

472
00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:07.510
I mean,

473
00:19:07.670 --> 00:19:09.270
2 Americans came only.

474
00:19:11.609 --> 00:19:12.020
I'm right.

475
00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:19.229
Surprise

476
00:19:48.989 --> 00:19:50.290
I had a word with Patrick again,

477
00:19:50.410 --> 00:19:50.609
Mother,

478
00:19:50.890 --> 00:19:51.530
everything's fine.

479
00:19:51.569 --> 00:19:54.800
That that can be arranged in Toronto quite easily

480
00:19:55.329 --> 00:19:56.010
for your brother.

481
00:19:57.349 --> 00:19:58.849
And we told him,

482
00:19:59.810 --> 00:20:01.089
and he said that's fine,

483
00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:01.880
he can fix it up because I think.

484
00:20:08.069 --> 00:20:09.270
You see in that it's not done,

485
00:20:09.349 --> 00:20:10.150
it's not.

486
00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:13.130
Whatever way you live,

487
00:20:13.390 --> 00:20:15.229
your brothers are supposed to live with you.

488
00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:18.069
I say I have a smaller

489
00:20:18.709 --> 00:20:19.500
and a big dog.

490
00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:24.500
He was only worried that on the next day when he arrives

491
00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:28.979
I must telephone to Michael and tell him to make sure that he comes on the 7th,

492
00:20:29.550 --> 00:20:29.770
but

493
00:20:30.150 --> 00:20:30.939
the 7th,

494
00:20:31.229 --> 00:20:33.739
so that he comes the next morning after you arrive.

495
00:20:34.550 --> 00:20:38.189
But he said the only problem there is that if he wants your attention.

496
00:20:39.839 --> 00:20:42.839
There are 3 or 4 press conferences lined up in that morning.

497
00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:43.729
I said not to worry,

498
00:20:43.810 --> 00:20:44.010
we'll

499
00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:47.579
we'll um.

500
00:20:49.869 --> 00:20:51.900
And also we can arrange for them to be taken.

501
00:20:52.339 --> 00:20:52.810
He's a very,

502
00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:53.500
very sensible.

503
00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:54.959
He's a very humble man.

504
00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:56.790
You'd be amazed.

505
00:20:59.890 --> 00:21:00.969
He believed in communism,

506
00:21:01.050 --> 00:21:01.699
that's all.

507
00:21:01.709 --> 00:21:01.719
Yes,

508
00:21:02.849 --> 00:21:04.089
he believes in communism.

509
00:21:04.170 --> 00:21:05.800
He thinks that communism is the only thing

510
00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:07.839
on the lounge room floor will be wonderful.

511
00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:11.339
Oh my word.

512
00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:13.550
And who is he helping as a bishop.

513
00:21:15.449 --> 00:21:16.800
He's a lawyer for that.

514
00:21:19.270 --> 00:21:21.260
For certain thing they.

515
00:21:22.569 --> 00:21:23.849
They have not got or something,

516
00:21:23.930 --> 00:21:25.319
so he's fighting for them.

517
00:21:25.969 --> 00:21:26.199
I mean,

518
00:21:26.209 --> 00:21:27.000
he's a lawyer.

519
00:21:28.209 --> 00:21:29.160
Communist lawyer.

520
00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:35.729
Patrick sounds much better,

521
00:21:35.819 --> 00:21:35.979
Mother.

522
00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:36.380
I think your

523
00:21:36.489 --> 00:21:37.219
Bundan is working

524
00:21:39.619 --> 00:21:41.099
whatever it's working.

525
00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:45.599
This is very well done.

526
00:21:45.719 --> 00:21:46.750
It's done it you.

527
00:21:47.569 --> 00:21:50.140
What about you people eating something doesn't look nice.

528
00:21:50.589 --> 00:21:52.949
I'm eating your mother and you are not eating.

529
00:21:53.229 --> 00:21:53.699
You all have.

530
00:21:54.589 --> 00:21:54.979
No.

531
00:21:55.390 --> 00:21:56.729
Let everyone have something.

532
00:21:57.469 --> 00:21:58.589
Your programme in Toronto,

533
00:21:58.670 --> 00:21:58.869
Mother,

534
00:21:58.910 --> 00:22:01.680
is in the Trinity United Church.

535
00:22:06.349 --> 00:22:06.800
So

536
00:22:07.390 --> 00:22:08.140
can't fail.

537
00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:20.160
See,

538
00:22:20.219 --> 00:22:20.650
actually,

539
00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:22.839
I'll tell you when they come out of the place.

540
00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:26.760
Without taking the responsibility like felicity.

541
00:22:28.959 --> 00:22:30.069
Restart Bost

542
00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:35.599
Like this Marcus in the words of Gregor Marcus.

543
00:22:37.290 --> 00:22:38.819
It nearly became horrible.

544
00:22:40.839 --> 00:22:42.760
You talked in such a funny manner,

545
00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:43.469
I tell you,

546
00:22:44.079 --> 00:22:44.800
can't imagine.

547
00:22:47.729 --> 00:22:49.670
And said when I came to Switzerland,

548
00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:52.130
I found it didn't have a left side.

549
00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:53.599
Now that I'm here,

550
00:22:53.839 --> 00:22:55.020
Switzerland has a left side.

551
00:22:58.719 --> 00:23:00.060
I mean so imperiously he

552
00:23:04.849 --> 00:23:04.930
he was doing this as he said it,

553
00:23:04.939 --> 00:23:04.959
you know,

554
00:23:04.969 --> 00:23:04.989
sort of.

555
00:23:06.329 --> 00:23:10.369
It's very particular about this that.

556
00:23:11.469 --> 00:23:13.790
I must say I just couldn't understand it.

557
00:23:15.939 --> 00:23:18.130
Dual Dual was very funny.

558
00:23:18.339 --> 00:23:18.900
He kept saying,

559
00:23:18.979 --> 00:23:19.260
oh God,

560
00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:20.290
I'm gonna run away.

561
00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:22.729
Maybe I'll get possessed by a Brahmin too.

562
00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:26.420
Brahmy.

563
00:23:28.099 --> 00:23:28.510
I think

564
00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:30.849
that's what he has done,

565
00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:31.569
you see.

566
00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:34.609
Some Indians have possessed these people.

567
00:23:36.579 --> 00:23:37.329
I think some Indians,

568
00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:38.819
definitely from Brahms.

569
00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:41.479
well didn't want to do Puja.

570
00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:41.969
He said,

571
00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:43.829
I'm not having anything to do with it.

572
00:23:44.479 --> 00:23:45.400
It's so funny.

573
00:23:47.969 --> 00:23:48.420
But

574
00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:50.109
I see it because

575
00:23:51.010 --> 00:23:53.469
all these people like they take money

576
00:23:54.660 --> 00:23:55.040
like.

577
00:23:56.459 --> 00:23:56.469
Uh,

578
00:23:57.410 --> 00:23:58.000
I love it.

579
00:23:58.719 --> 00:23:59.550
Peter Pearce

580
00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:02.060
took away $2000

581
00:24:02.199 --> 00:24:03.760
2000 pounds this time.

582
00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:06.189
All this is Indian style business.

583
00:24:08.109 --> 00:24:08.119
Yeah

584
00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:17.250
that boy in South Australia stole $500 from Sully and Phillip.

585
00:24:19.699 --> 00:24:22.380
and the very first fellow that came to Adelaide,

586
00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:22.739
mother,

587
00:24:22.939 --> 00:24:23.130
not you,

588
00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:24.780
you may not remember him,

589
00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:25.949
John Anderson,

590
00:24:26.489 --> 00:24:41.229
who stole $500 from Sally Anderson was the TTM fellow.

591
00:24:41.239 --> 00:24:41.250
Ah,

592
00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:41.770
they steal always stealing that's the point.

593
00:24:41.890 --> 00:24:41.979
That's that's coming in.

594
00:24:42.089 --> 00:24:42.920
That's how they steal and you know,

595
00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:43.810
another thing,

596
00:24:44.219 --> 00:24:45.839
once we go to a restaurant.

597
00:24:46.339 --> 00:24:46.349
And

598
00:24:47.089 --> 00:24:47.650
Peter said,

599
00:24:47.670 --> 00:24:48.890
I'll drive you down.

600
00:24:48.930 --> 00:24:49.739
I know the rest.

601
00:24:50.859 --> 00:24:51.489
So it's a very

602
00:24:52.930 --> 00:24:55.489
Out of place and that's not that expensive,

603
00:24:55.609 --> 00:24:56.520
quite expensive.

604
00:24:57.349 --> 00:24:57.979
And you had,

605
00:24:58.060 --> 00:24:59.410
you had invited the

606
00:24:59.579 --> 00:25:01.209
ambassador or someone there,

607
00:25:02.319 --> 00:25:02.339
huh,

608
00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:03.780
ambassador.

609
00:25:04.770 --> 00:25:05.209
So

610
00:25:05.579 --> 00:25:06.560
when you read it,

611
00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:07.790
CPS teacher,

612
00:25:07.939 --> 00:25:09.339
you also come along and have your food.

613
00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:11.800
So Ri Ruth said hello,

614
00:25:11.869 --> 00:25:13.579
hello how are you this that.

615
00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:15.780
So I asked the person in charge.

616
00:25:15.829 --> 00:25:16.069
I said,

617
00:25:16.150 --> 00:25:16.800
how do you know him?

618
00:25:16.959 --> 00:25:17.060
Oh,

619
00:25:17.109 --> 00:25:17.880
he comes said very young.

620
00:25:19.449 --> 00:25:19.829
I said,

621
00:25:19.839 --> 00:25:20.439
really?

622
00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:22.209
And I asked Linda.

623
00:25:22.849 --> 00:25:24.439
Linda said that every

624
00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:27.839
practically every night she used to take us to some Indian restaurant.

625
00:25:28.339 --> 00:25:28.599
So I said,

626
00:25:28.619 --> 00:25:29.510
why didn't you ask him from?

627
00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:30.489
Where do you get this money?

628
00:25:30.579 --> 00:25:32.209
And that's how we became bankrupt.

629
00:25:33.869 --> 00:25:37.329
Some Indian fellow cannot eat any other food so as to get to Indian restaurants.

630
00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:38.290
Tina.

631
00:25:43.979 --> 00:25:45.099
Amazing how they work.

632
00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:45.619
That.

633
00:25:47.229 --> 00:25:49.500
They they are like that.

634
00:25:49.550 --> 00:25:49.949
They

635
00:25:50.430 --> 00:25:51.500
steal money.

636
00:25:51.790 --> 00:25:53.180
EMP said be careful.

637
00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:15.290
Oh,

638
00:26:16.030 --> 00:26:16.410
thank you.

639
00:26:21.739 --> 00:26:22.500
Who's that?

640
00:26:23.410 --> 00:26:24.089
Cacciatore,

641
00:26:24.130 --> 00:26:24.369
mother.

642
00:26:24.579 --> 00:26:24.609
Chicken,

643
00:26:25.290 --> 00:26:26.430
chicken cacciatore.

644
00:26:27.130 --> 00:26:28.439
What is that got to do?

645
00:26:28.569 --> 00:26:29.770
It's an Italian dish,

646
00:26:29.810 --> 00:26:30.050
Mother,

647
00:26:30.130 --> 00:26:30.599
which,

648
00:26:31.290 --> 00:26:32.199
in which you cook

649
00:26:32.489 --> 00:26:34.089
onions and garlic and

650
00:26:34.459 --> 00:26:35.530
I would have liked that.

651
00:26:36.339 --> 00:26:37.780
Why to make separate for me now.

652
00:26:41.530 --> 00:26:42.180
Would you like a taste?

653
00:26:42.229 --> 00:26:42.239
Oh,

654
00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:42.280
little bit

655
00:26:46.619 --> 00:26:46.979
little bit,

656
00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:47.180
but I'm too a little bit.

657
00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:47.380
I,

658
00:26:47.459 --> 00:26:48.270
I'll have from you.

659
00:26:48.619 --> 00:26:49.060
Let's see what is.

660
00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:54.130
Chicken and tomato and paste,

661
00:26:54.319 --> 00:26:55.030
it's a nice

662
00:26:55.599 --> 00:26:55.829
chicken,

663
00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:56.859
tomato paste,

664
00:26:57.439 --> 00:26:59.180
and vegetables

665
00:26:59.439 --> 00:27:00.800
and spice and herbs.

666
00:27:02.630 --> 00:27:03.069
It's a,

667
00:27:03.189 --> 00:27:04.880
it's a typical European dish.

668
00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:12.270
It's lovely.

669
00:27:12.989 --> 00:27:13.849
It's a good dish.

670
00:27:14.270 --> 00:27:15.020
It's quite,

671
00:27:15.229 --> 00:27:16.859
quite spicy and nice.

672
00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:19.739
Would you like some of your own mother?

673
00:27:20.709 --> 00:27:20.829
No,

674
00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:20.949
no,

675
00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:21.390
no,

676
00:27:21.459 --> 00:27:21.829
I'm ready.

677
00:27:22.650 --> 00:27:22.699
I have tea.

678
00:27:22.709 --> 00:27:22.719
Do

679
00:27:26.270 --> 00:27:27.150
some other tea you have

680
00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:31.560
Jasmine.

681
00:27:32.989 --> 00:27:35.760
I guess if you put a little chilli it will taste better.

682
00:27:38.829 --> 00:27:40.670
I just put this back into the main bowl and.

683
00:27:50.099 --> 00:27:50.550
Thank you.

684
00:28:19.170 --> 00:28:20.660
This house is an architect's house.

685
00:28:20.729 --> 00:28:21.989
You can see clearly

686
00:28:23.569 --> 00:28:24.969
run by an architecture.

687
00:28:32.130 --> 00:28:34.119
So this white thing has left one more.

688
00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:41.589
to continue the whiteness of the roof,

689
00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:42.880
the ceiling downwards,

690
00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:43.239
isn't it

691
00:28:53.430 --> 00:28:53.510
could be for a painting or something.

692
00:28:57.579 --> 00:28:59.089
But there's no wall here anyway,

693
00:28:59.199 --> 00:28:59.689
you see,

694
00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:05.390
so that must be the reason for that.

695
00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:10.729
And inside is the

696
00:29:11.449 --> 00:29:12.400
for the fire is very good very good idea for.

697
00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:33.189
I think from that news programme tonight we'll get a lot of people tomorrow night.

698
00:29:34.089 --> 00:29:36.280
A lot of people will come from that interview tonight,

699
00:29:36.489 --> 00:29:37.089
I think so.

700
00:29:37.819 --> 00:29:37.849
I hope so.

701
00:29:43.430 --> 00:29:43.979
Because they'll,

702
00:29:44.189 --> 00:29:45.280
they'll come because they,

703
00:29:46.229 --> 00:29:47.430
the interviewer was very.

704
00:29:48.150 --> 00:29:50.260
Abrupt and very sharp and

705
00:29:51.189 --> 00:29:54.589
You just cooled it to put a sophisticated

706
00:29:58.489 --> 00:29:59.930
attitude towards the whole thing above it all as if he was above it all,

707
00:29:59.959 --> 00:30:00.550
you know.

708
00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:00.569
Yeah,

709
00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:03.119
I got turned around on him,

710
00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:03.560
didn't it?

711
00:30:03.609 --> 00:30:03.630
I mean,

712
00:30:04.670 --> 00:30:05.520
you were fascinating,

713
00:30:05.599 --> 00:30:07.599
you appeared to be completely fascinating.

714
00:30:07.609 --> 00:30:12.510
I must say the way you deflected his questions and then gave him such a lot

715
00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:13.660
in return,

716
00:30:13.719 --> 00:30:14.400
you know,

717
00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:16.079
to sort of chew on it was

718
00:30:16.479 --> 00:30:17.069
very good.

719
00:30:18.050 --> 00:30:19.530
Put this in your pipe and smoke it.

720
00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:23.930
Yes,

721
00:30:25.969 --> 00:30:27.680
I think he was a bit taken aback.

722
00:30:28.329 --> 00:30:30.680
Probably a good thing that he didn't have much more time.

723
00:30:30.729 --> 00:30:32.660
I think he would have run out of questions.

724
00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:36.010
OK

725
00:30:37.849 --> 00:30:39.599
that he at least gave us quite a nice

726
00:30:55.459 --> 00:30:55.589
he said where it's being held twice,

727
00:30:55.599 --> 00:30:55.619
you see,

728
00:30:55.630 --> 00:30:56.890
he felt that there's something about then he did sometimes these interviewers.

729
00:30:57.890 --> 00:31:01.910
Deliberately have a tendency to sound aggressive,

730
00:31:02.290 --> 00:31:04.439
to try and sound impartial to the audience,

731
00:31:04.890 --> 00:31:07.170
but actually sometimes they're quite sympathetic to them

732
00:31:11.670 --> 00:31:11.969
because

733
00:31:12.609 --> 00:31:13.920
when I finished with him,

734
00:31:14.209 --> 00:31:15.359
he was much gentler

735
00:31:21.949 --> 00:31:21.989
thank you very

736
00:31:24.729 --> 00:31:25.239
very well.

737
00:31:30.329 --> 00:31:31.900
You that's something about the.

738
00:31:33.209 --> 00:31:33.219
Yeah.

739
00:31:38.949 --> 00:31:41.790
But Italians eat that pasta so much I mean.

740
00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:45.439
Yes.

741
00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:48.800
Pasta they eat whatever they eat that to you.

742
00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:52.150
The pizza business.

743
00:31:52.229 --> 00:31:53.020
Spaghetti,

744
00:31:53.430 --> 00:31:54.050
spaghetti.

745
00:31:56.439 --> 00:31:56.780
Mm.

746
00:31:59.609 --> 00:32:01.650
Did you see Billy and Rosie when you were in Italy?

747
00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:02.119
Oh,

748
00:32:03.130 --> 00:32:03.609
very nice.

749
00:32:03.719 --> 00:32:05.040
You're working in restaurants now.

750
00:32:05.569 --> 00:32:06.369
Billy has become.

751
00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:06.459
You saw him because he came to England,

752
00:32:11.890 --> 00:32:12.900
he came to England,

753
00:32:12.910 --> 00:32:13.449
um.

754
00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:16.369
I think just before you went to Rome.

755
00:32:17.030 --> 00:32:17.569
Yes.

756
00:32:18.380 --> 00:32:18.920
uh,

757
00:32:19.380 --> 00:32:20.420
he seemed very well.

758
00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:22.650
What will he say?

759
00:32:22.859 --> 00:32:22.979
Well,

760
00:32:23.099 --> 00:32:26.650
he was telling us just about how he was working in the restaurant

761
00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:28.010
and how

762
00:32:28.819 --> 00:32:31.729
his child Zania liked being out in Italy,

763
00:32:31.939 --> 00:32:34.089
but they were having this tremendous heat wave.

764
00:32:34.430 --> 00:32:36.770
Do you remember Italy had this tremendous heat wave

765
00:32:36.770 --> 00:32:40.770
and they were having temperatures of about 110 every day

766
00:32:40.989 --> 00:32:42.969
and the forests were catching on fire.

767
00:32:43.650 --> 00:32:45.000
I mean they were having a lot of,

768
00:32:45.209 --> 00:32:45.439
you know,

769
00:32:45.609 --> 00:32:46.339
problems because I

770
00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:50.579
really,

771
00:32:50.729 --> 00:32:51.329
really,

772
00:32:51.699 --> 00:32:52.849
because they were the worst in Europe.

773
00:32:52.890 --> 00:32:55.479
We had a heatwave in England and France,

774
00:32:55.530 --> 00:32:57.010
but Italy was the hottest,

775
00:32:57.050 --> 00:32:57.479
you know,

776
00:32:57.650 --> 00:32:58.290
the worst.

777
00:32:59.760 --> 00:32:59.839
What was last year like last year good?

778
00:32:59.849 --> 00:32:59.880
A no problem

779
00:33:09.599 --> 00:33:11.550
was a problem there because you see

780
00:33:12.089 --> 00:33:13.520
he is a left-sided fellow,

781
00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:16.430
but quite obstinate,

782
00:33:16.489 --> 00:33:21.020
very obstinate or something or something that's obstinous.

783
00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:22.630
And what he does,

784
00:33:22.750 --> 00:33:24.020
he locks up himself

785
00:33:24.709 --> 00:33:25.819
for 2 or 3 days.

786
00:33:26.069 --> 00:33:27.189
I'm not going to do any work,

787
00:33:27.229 --> 00:33:27.819
he said.

788
00:33:28.750 --> 00:33:30.099
Now this fellow said that.

789
00:33:31.839 --> 00:33:32.170
You see,

790
00:33:32.250 --> 00:33:33.760
suddenly if you're working with someone

791
00:33:34.530 --> 00:33:36.329
and if you say I'm not going to work at all,

792
00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:37.599
then what is the person?

793
00:33:38.709 --> 00:33:38.719
Yeah.

794
00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:41.300
Just any luck of himself,

795
00:33:41.369 --> 00:33:42.140
absolutely.

796
00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:43.260
I

797
00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:47.030
Poor widow was very much unhappy about it.

798
00:33:47.829 --> 00:33:47.839
Mm.

799
00:33:49.410 --> 00:33:49.540
You do,

800
00:33:49.579 --> 00:33:49.819
yes.

801
00:33:51.209 --> 00:33:51.229
the good.

802
00:33:54.239 --> 00:33:58.839
It was lovely the way the Italians kind of helped you with the house doing the marble.

803
00:34:00.239 --> 00:34:00.859
It all floors,

804
00:34:00.869 --> 00:34:02.010
isn't that beautiful?

805
00:34:02.170 --> 00:34:02.969
All through out the base.

806
00:34:03.060 --> 00:34:04.680
I gave them a special present.

807
00:34:05.510 --> 00:34:05.890
I said,

808
00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:07.650
you're coming to India and I'm going to pay.

809
00:34:07.770 --> 00:34:08.918
They won't take any money.

810
00:34:10.739 --> 00:34:10.750
Oh,

811
00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:10.800
that's nice.

812
00:34:10.889 --> 00:34:11.199
I said,

813
00:34:11.208 --> 00:34:11.449
Mother,

814
00:34:11.649 --> 00:34:13.320
it was a great chance to be there,

815
00:34:13.969 --> 00:34:14.080
Mother.

816
00:34:14.208 --> 00:34:14.570
So I said,

817
00:34:14.649 --> 00:34:15.000
all right,

818
00:34:15.010 --> 00:34:15.600
now

819
00:34:16.340 --> 00:34:16.350
you,

820
00:34:16.449 --> 00:34:17.520
you don't take any money.

821
00:34:18.330 --> 00:34:19.208
But uh,

822
00:34:19.489 --> 00:34:23.399
you come to India and you don't have to pay for your food for

823
00:34:24.530 --> 00:34:25.290
400.

824
00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:26.090
Do

825
00:34:27.629 --> 00:34:28.320
like that.

826
00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:30.159
Then they thought that it is too much.

827
00:34:31.188 --> 00:34:31.429
I said,

828
00:34:31.469 --> 00:34:32.620
what are we doing now?

829
00:34:33.110 --> 00:34:33.750
That is decided.

830
00:34:34.879 --> 00:34:37.639
So I asked 5 of them who were there

831
00:34:38.050 --> 00:34:38.560
to come.

832
00:34:40.688 --> 00:34:41.840
How's the restaurant going,

833
00:34:41.929 --> 00:34:42.879
is it going all right,

834
00:34:43.090 --> 00:34:43.688
the uh?

835
00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:45.679
It's going

836
00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:46.810
all right as such,

837
00:34:46.969 --> 00:34:48.159
but that pizzario,

838
00:34:48.330 --> 00:34:53.610
is she the one who makes pizza is $2000 it takes,

839
00:34:54.530 --> 00:34:55.770
so it's too much for them

840
00:34:56.129 --> 00:34:56.570
to pay.

841
00:34:57.449 --> 00:34:59.399
Now they have decided to remove him,

842
00:34:59.610 --> 00:35:01.689
so they are getting no pay or something like that.

843
00:35:01.729 --> 00:35:02.600
They're still working it out,

844
00:35:04.050 --> 00:35:05.780
but now I sorted it out for them.

845
00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:07.989
They'll get money,

846
00:35:08.149 --> 00:35:08.429
food,

847
00:35:08.669 --> 00:35:08.810
everything,

848
00:35:08.830 --> 00:35:09.939
but what a place.

849
00:35:10.030 --> 00:35:11.860
I won't believe what a place.

850
00:35:13.370 --> 00:35:15.560
If you have to see the real you came there,

851
00:35:16.699 --> 00:35:18.520
the real blessing of your mother,

852
00:35:18.889 --> 00:35:19.820
that's the place.

853
00:35:21.810 --> 00:35:24.199
It's in this lovely place high up in the hill.

854
00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:26.479
Every room has got a bathroom.

855
00:35:27.550 --> 00:35:27.560
Uh,

856
00:35:28.540 --> 00:35:30.260
some of the bedrooms are on this side.

857
00:35:31.209 --> 00:35:31.929
Incredible.

858
00:35:32.090 --> 00:35:33.370
It's a tremendous place.

859
00:35:40.139 --> 00:35:41.979
But I think people don't realise it.

860
00:35:41.989 --> 00:35:43.189
They take it for granted.

861
00:35:45.239 --> 00:35:46.840
But Italians that we are very,

862
00:35:46.879 --> 00:35:47.639
very sensible,

863
00:35:47.679 --> 00:35:48.290
you know,

864
00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:50.000
very sensible.

865
00:35:56.449 --> 00:35:58.790
They have the sense of gratitude in them and

866
00:35:59.629 --> 00:36:00.229
they realise,

867
00:36:00.310 --> 00:36:01.100
isn't it?

868
00:36:01.510 --> 00:36:02.659
You've also got a very

869
00:36:03.669 --> 00:36:04.860
good quality to

870
00:36:05.469 --> 00:36:08.060
culturally it's there's something rooted there.

871
00:36:09.219 --> 00:36:12.229
They've got a natural grace and a natural dignity and

872
00:36:12.739 --> 00:36:16.770
Imagine they would not take any money from me for the making of the floor,

873
00:36:17.379 --> 00:36:18.649
not a single pie.

874
00:36:20.860 --> 00:36:21.040
They,

875
00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:23.739
they held the programmes in such a lovely hall for Mother.

876
00:36:23.780 --> 00:36:24.310
It was

877
00:36:24.699 --> 00:36:28.879
a hall with a painting created on the ceiling by a realised soul and Beautiful.

878
00:36:29.459 --> 00:36:30.100
And you know,

879
00:36:30.219 --> 00:36:31.959
there's a dignity about what they do.

880
00:36:33.139 --> 00:36:34.050
When they sing to mother,

881
00:36:34.060 --> 00:36:34.850
they sing

882
00:36:38.189 --> 00:36:38.199
from,

883
00:36:38.209 --> 00:36:38.229
you know,

884
00:36:38.250 --> 00:36:39.209
from the careful about when they got it,

885
00:36:39.459 --> 00:36:40.840
I think I paid for the hall.

886
00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:44.979
But the hall was very reasonably actually it was very reasonable.

887
00:36:45.020 --> 00:36:46.469
It was granted by the city.

888
00:36:47.340 --> 00:36:48.489
You see what happened?

889
00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:50.979
They went to the city mayor.

890
00:36:52.379 --> 00:36:54.020
I talk to him about me.

891
00:36:54.229 --> 00:36:56.419
And he's going to distribute them over the whole country,

892
00:36:56.679 --> 00:36:59.459
so you should contact him with magnificent posters.

893
00:37:00.110 --> 00:37:00.989
I'm just free,

894
00:37:01.030 --> 00:37:01.469
of course,

895
00:37:01.669 --> 00:37:02.189
you might.

896
00:37:04.100 --> 00:37:05.129
The Italians said that,

897
00:37:05.169 --> 00:37:05.389
you see,

898
00:37:05.419 --> 00:37:07.800
he was so impressed by the photograph and all that.

899
00:37:08.129 --> 00:37:09.050
We did it all free,

900
00:37:09.189 --> 00:37:09.409
he said,

901
00:37:09.929 --> 00:37:12.610
and he gave us the hall at a very nominal price.

902
00:37:12.649 --> 00:37:17.120
I don't know about $50.50 dollars or $100.

903
00:37:17.169 --> 00:37:19.159
I think it was $75

904
00:37:19.489 --> 00:37:21.679
but for a hall you should have seen it,

905
00:37:21.929 --> 00:37:23.689
a huge big place,

906
00:37:23.729 --> 00:37:24.129
you know.

907
00:37:24.719 --> 00:37:27.919
And the town hall actually it was the town hall he gave us.

908
00:37:28.050 --> 00:37:29.159
It's Sala Boromini,

909
00:37:29.330 --> 00:37:30.360
which is the famous,

910
00:37:30.530 --> 00:37:31.679
the most famous

911
00:37:32.090 --> 00:37:34.520
meeting hall in Sydney in the city,

912
00:37:34.590 --> 00:37:39.530
and then for the final night they hired what is the equivalent of the BBC hall.

913
00:37:40.090 --> 00:37:40.409
Oh,

914
00:37:40.449 --> 00:37:40.459
sure.

915
00:37:42.010 --> 00:37:42.219
It,

916
00:37:42.330 --> 00:37:43.669
it was brand new,

917
00:37:44.310 --> 00:37:45.770
absolutely superb,

918
00:37:45.850 --> 00:37:46.360
and

919
00:37:46.659 --> 00:37:49.530
fit for symphony orchestra concerts.

920
00:37:49.610 --> 00:37:51.050
Tremendous tremendous.

921
00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:52.820
And you.

922
00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:56.870
And it's never ever been used for a public programme,

923
00:37:56.879 --> 00:37:57.800
and that's what I said.

924
00:37:57.959 --> 00:37:59.110
When you are positive,

925
00:37:59.199 --> 00:37:59.709
thank you,

926
00:37:59.879 --> 00:38:00.840
then things work out.

927
00:38:01.580 --> 00:38:04.969
They themselves were surprised at how they were given all this,

928
00:38:05.050 --> 00:38:05.899
you see that

929
00:38:06.250 --> 00:38:07.620
free this thing imagine

930
00:38:08.169 --> 00:38:11.199
the authorities themselves printing

931
00:38:11.370 --> 00:38:14.750
the posters and placing and placing them

932
00:38:14.969 --> 00:38:16.169
in the proper places.

933
00:38:16.290 --> 00:38:17.669
Can you think of it?

934
00:38:18.090 --> 00:38:18.729
Very good.

935
00:38:19.689 --> 00:38:22.820
And the hall that was worth for 500 to $600.

936
00:38:23.479 --> 00:38:25.570
We were only for $75.

937
00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:35.469
Ruth said even communism has some advantages.

938
00:38:37.340 --> 00:38:38.409
Putting the posters up.

939
00:38:41.110 --> 00:38:44.419
And we had at least 400 to 500 people every day,

940
00:38:45.389 --> 00:38:46.810
at least 500 people,

941
00:38:48.989 --> 00:38:51.459
and Austria also we had about 500 people.

942
00:38:54.310 --> 00:38:54.600
Rome,

943
00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:55.500
Austria,

944
00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:57.179
Geneva was very good too.

945
00:38:57.300 --> 00:38:57.860
Geneva

946
00:38:58.389 --> 00:38:59.260
programmes were full.

947
00:39:01.870 --> 00:39:02.959
We had a couple of rat bags,

948
00:39:02.989 --> 00:39:04.250
but Mother threw them out.

949
00:39:07.739 --> 00:39:07.750
Good.

950
00:39:11.110 --> 00:39:12.100
The Bible bashing,

951
00:39:12.879 --> 00:39:14.949
but the audience actually threw them out.

952
00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:16.709
The audience audience.

953
00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:20.840
Let's go back one Mexican came forward.

954
00:39:20.989 --> 00:39:22.340
It's a very tall.

955
00:39:25.629 --> 00:39:28.030
To the shoes,

956
00:39:28.389 --> 00:39:29.500
but the best part of it,

957
00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:32.679
the fellow who came with the Bible to hit me actually was going back like this,

958
00:39:32.750 --> 00:39:33.040
you see.

959
00:39:33.389 --> 00:39:34.219
He couldn't come forward.

960
00:39:34.310 --> 00:39:35.229
He was going backwards,

961
00:39:35.310 --> 00:39:35.709
backwards,

962
00:39:35.810 --> 00:39:36.189
backwards,

963
00:39:36.239 --> 00:39:36.530
you see,

964
00:39:36.989 --> 00:39:38.699
though I was not moving towards him,

965
00:39:41.110 --> 00:39:41.830
very big fellow.

966
00:39:42.229 --> 00:39:43.419
I think he was paid for it

967
00:39:44.350 --> 00:39:44.760
because.

968
00:39:45.169 --> 00:39:47.840
Mangal Singh and this Brahan were coming that side.

969
00:39:48.090 --> 00:39:48.290
He said,

970
00:39:48.330 --> 00:39:49.850
Are you going to listen to these ladies?

971
00:39:49.889 --> 00:39:50.169
They said,

972
00:39:50.250 --> 00:39:50.370
Yes,

973
00:39:50.449 --> 00:39:50.840
why?

974
00:39:51.010 --> 00:39:51.250
He said,

975
00:39:51.330 --> 00:39:51.889
Don't go there.

976
00:39:51.929 --> 00:39:52.649
You'll go to hell.

977
00:39:52.689 --> 00:39:52.959
He said,

978
00:39:53.010 --> 00:39:54.479
we are already in heaven,

979
00:39:54.530 --> 00:39:55.610
but you'll go to hell.

980
00:39:55.820 --> 00:39:57.659
Immediately they dropped down the thing.

981
00:39:58.010 --> 00:39:59.919
See that banner on the ground,

982
00:40:00.489 --> 00:40:01.090
you know that?

983
00:40:01.159 --> 00:40:01.169
Yes,

984
00:40:01.209 --> 00:40:01.659
yes,

985
00:40:02.209 --> 00:40:04.000
and afterwards they came to collect it.

986
00:40:07.250 --> 00:40:07.260
Mm.

987
00:40:10.850 --> 00:40:12.530
Experiences and experience,

988
00:40:12.810 --> 00:40:14.260
but I may say Geneva,

989
00:40:14.409 --> 00:40:14.879
even,

990
00:40:14.889 --> 00:40:15.600
even

991
00:40:16.090 --> 00:40:17.330
France was very good.

992
00:40:17.409 --> 00:40:18.050
Milos,

993
00:40:18.379 --> 00:40:19.590
Milos was great.

994
00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:19.610
Great.

995
00:40:19.649 --> 00:40:21.550
That was the most crowded place,

996
00:40:21.570 --> 00:40:22.719
a brand new city.

997
00:40:23.649 --> 00:40:24.169
Milos,

998
00:40:24.330 --> 00:40:25.919
ordinary industrial city,

999
00:40:26.649 --> 00:40:27.979
and they did such a good job.

1000
00:40:28.050 --> 00:40:30.520
There's a journalist there who's so positive and

1001
00:40:31.010 --> 00:40:32.100
the pool was overflowing,

1002
00:40:32.169 --> 00:40:32.409
wasn't it,

1003
00:40:32.530 --> 00:40:32.760
Mother,

1004
00:40:32.770 --> 00:40:33.840
and they all.

1005
00:40:34.199 --> 00:40:36.040
And we went to another place,

1006
00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:37.610
uh,

1007
00:40:37.689 --> 00:40:38.250
Mal,

1008
00:40:38.340 --> 00:40:39.449
what was the name of that?

1009
00:40:40.899 --> 00:40:41.770
It all something.

1010
00:40:42.350 --> 00:40:43.459
I remember because Vita from Italy but

1011
00:40:45.550 --> 00:40:47.290
that's when Chrissy went there also,

1012
00:40:47.350 --> 00:40:47.820
you see,

1013
00:40:47.989 --> 00:40:49.820
they said we want to start a centre here.

1014
00:40:50.229 --> 00:40:51.620
I think we never had a meeting there,

1015
00:40:51.669 --> 00:40:53.669
but people came all the way for the workshop.

1016
00:40:58.419 --> 00:40:58.459
It's off.

1017
00:41:03.580 --> 00:41:06.870
Also Paris and the provinces of Dan Bordeaux is going to begin.

1018
00:41:07.679 --> 00:41:08.179
Uh,

1019
00:41:08.419 --> 00:41:08.739
actually,

1020
00:41:08.820 --> 00:41:10.050
right now there is

1021
00:41:10.459 --> 00:41:11.290
right now this,

1022
00:41:11.379 --> 00:41:13.409
this time there's a programme on in um

1023
00:41:13.699 --> 00:41:14.389
in Bordeaux,

1024
00:41:14.820 --> 00:41:16.010
that young boy that came and

1025
00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:20.139
in Moos in

1026
00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:22.189
And Brittany,

1027
00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:23.590
Brittany is doing very well.

1028
00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:25.429
Brittany is coming up Rouen,

1029
00:41:25.439 --> 00:41:26.139
Rouen,

1030
00:41:26.149 --> 00:41:26.169
very bad,

1031
00:41:26.179 --> 00:41:26.189
yeah.

1032
00:41:29.830 --> 00:41:29.840
See,

1033
00:41:29.959 --> 00:41:30.959
France has flared up.

1034
00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:32.959
I don't know.

1035
00:41:36.479 --> 00:41:36.639
It

1036
00:41:37.629 --> 00:41:37.790
They

1037
00:41:40.239 --> 00:41:41.199
I think you have to travel,

1038
00:41:41.219 --> 00:41:42.580
you people have to travel

1039
00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:44.080
in in November.

1040
00:41:44.090 --> 00:41:45.139
I'm going to go

1041
00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:46.330
to English

1042
00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:47.590
places

1043
00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:50.199
except for Scotland I've scratched out.

1044
00:41:56.610 --> 00:41:57.239
Not brighton anymore,

1045
00:41:57.790 --> 00:41:58.179
I think.

1046
00:42:00.050 --> 00:42:00.939
We had been right,

1047
00:42:01.050 --> 00:42:01.500
isn't it.

1048
00:42:02.290 --> 00:42:03.030
Yeah.

1049
00:42:03.969 --> 00:42:04.120
You had,

1050
00:42:05.209 --> 00:42:06.469
you had the Buddha's birthday.

1051
00:42:07.889 --> 00:42:08.699
So we have finished.

1052
00:42:10.639 --> 00:42:12.250
I think we have to go to places,

1053
00:42:12.429 --> 00:42:12.530
Cambridge Cambridge,

1054
00:42:12.540 --> 00:42:12.649
Norwich,

1055
00:42:12.659 --> 00:42:12.739
Norwich is doing that.

1056
00:42:12.750 --> 00:42:12.790
Norham,

1057
00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:12.860
Northampton that one

1058
00:42:32.439 --> 00:42:32.959

1059
00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:33.439

maybe Plymouth,

1061
00:42:35.080 --> 00:42:35.840
maybe.

1062
00:42:37.330 --> 00:42:37.899
Something you might,

1063
00:42:37.979 --> 00:42:40.889
what about um Radio Southampton or something like that?

1064
00:42:41.139 --> 00:42:42.629
I don't know if they're there anymore.

1065
00:42:44.219 --> 00:42:44.850
Yeats.

1066
00:42:46.070 --> 00:42:46.689
Southern part.

1067
00:42:49.889 --> 00:42:50.080
Maybe,

1068
00:42:51.389 --> 00:42:53.340
maybe Sheffield perhaps.

1069
00:42:53.750 --> 00:42:54.239
Sheffield,

1070
00:42:54.550 --> 00:42:54.949
Sheffield,

1071
00:42:55.030 --> 00:42:55.389
Sheffield,

1072
00:42:55.409 --> 00:42:56.020
of course,

1073
00:42:56.360 --> 00:42:57.479
and Sheffield,

1074
00:42:57.510 --> 00:42:57.830
of course,

1075
00:42:57.870 --> 00:43:00.419
and the other one is uh Manchester,

1076
00:43:00.959 --> 00:43:01.500
Manchester.

1077
00:43:01.629 --> 00:43:01.669
No,

1078
00:43:01.719 --> 00:43:01.790
no,

1079
00:43:01.879 --> 00:43:01.909
no,

1080
00:43:01.989 --> 00:43:03.590
the one that is.

1081
00:43:08.409 --> 00:43:08.879
Uh,

1082
00:43:09.129 --> 00:43:09.580
gonna be.

1083
00:43:09.850 --> 00:43:11.000
From where we got Kirby.

1084
00:43:11.729 --> 00:43:11.889
Yeah,

1085
00:43:11.969 --> 00:43:13.000
we got Bristol Bristol.

1086
00:43:14.129 --> 00:43:14.739
Oh yes,

1087
00:43:14.850 --> 00:43:15.639
Bristol.

1088
00:43:16.419 --> 00:43:16.530
Yes,

1089
00:43:16.610 --> 00:43:16.949
that's right,

1090
00:43:17.060 --> 00:43:17.770
that's in the west.

1091
00:43:17.929 --> 00:43:18.179
Bristol,

1092
00:43:18.250 --> 00:43:19.239
the centre is not good,

1093
00:43:19.250 --> 00:43:20.530
but we get wonderful people.

1094
00:43:20.689 --> 00:43:20.929
Yes,

1095
00:43:21.129 --> 00:43:21.610
it's,

1096
00:43:21.649 --> 00:43:24.439
they're also having the meetings in Glastonbury.

1097
00:43:25.689 --> 00:43:26.449
Glastonbury,

1098
00:43:26.570 --> 00:43:27.399
Glastonbury,

1099
00:43:27.500 --> 00:43:30.159
which is near Bristol where they have the big tour,

1100
00:43:30.530 --> 00:43:32.479
like this big hill with the

1101
00:43:32.929 --> 00:43:34.030
monument on the top,

1102
00:43:34.729 --> 00:43:36.399
where all the lay lines cross.

1103
00:43:37.080 --> 00:43:37.699
Airlines

1104
00:43:39.870 --> 00:43:41.679
Those lines of force that go there.

1105
00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:43.600
At Glastonbury,

1106
00:43:43.639 --> 00:43:43.989
yes.

1107
00:43:44.870 --> 00:43:45.760
But also in Oxford,

1108
00:43:45.929 --> 00:43:47.489
they've got both of them,

1109
00:43:47.689 --> 00:43:51.810
the big ones there's several centres around that they intersect.

1110
00:43:54.310 --> 00:43:55.580
They're the ones that they know.

1111
00:43:56.260 --> 00:43:58.310
The mother telling us about the ones that.

1112
00:43:58.590 --> 00:43:58.949
That's right.

1113
00:43:59.429 --> 00:44:00.949
I think Bristol is a great idea actually,

1114
00:44:01.070 --> 00:44:01.419
yes.

1115
00:44:01.550 --> 00:44:02.070
That's it now,

1116
00:44:02.149 --> 00:44:03.989
this one is you're talking near Bristol,

1117
00:44:04.030 --> 00:44:05.540
we went to that place.

1118
00:44:09.510 --> 00:44:10.199
Welham and that's near there.

1119
00:44:11.790 --> 00:44:13.189
So we had a seminar there,

1120
00:44:13.270 --> 00:44:13.820
didn't we?

1121
00:44:14.550 --> 00:44:19.149
I didn't see the seminar in Cheltenhamltenham in the gardens in the gardens,

1122
00:44:19.189 --> 00:44:21.139
and then we went out to the ven Springs,

1123
00:44:22.989 --> 00:44:26.620
and we have that lovely video film where you actually bless the source of the Thames.

1124
00:44:26.870 --> 00:44:27.669
I've seen that video,

1125
00:44:27.750 --> 00:44:28.020
it's tremendous.

1126
00:44:28.030 --> 00:44:28.080
Somebody told me,

1127
00:44:28.090 --> 00:44:28.120
was it you,

1128
00:44:28.129 --> 00:44:28.149
Nick,

1129
00:44:28.159 --> 00:44:28.169
that

1130
00:44:36.750 --> 00:44:36.830
there,

1131
00:44:37.030 --> 00:44:40.350
there's been a report on the Thames and it's becoming less polluted.

1132
00:44:41.550 --> 00:44:43.580
becoming less polluted.

1133
00:44:44.189 --> 00:44:44.270
Yes,

1134
00:44:45.739 --> 00:44:47.409
I said has to become the Ganges now.

1135
00:44:48.110 --> 00:44:52.540
But there was an official report and in which maybe it was Magda or somebody told me

1136
00:44:53.149 --> 00:44:54.939
on the condition of the Thames,

1137
00:44:55.219 --> 00:44:56.419
and it's just happened.

1138
00:44:57.030 --> 00:44:58.030
At first they had a flight

1139
00:44:58.510 --> 00:45:02.580
that comes out like going to a big space and all that.

1140
00:45:03.560 --> 00:45:03.570
Yeah,

1141
00:45:03.590 --> 00:45:04.419
overflow,

1142
00:45:04.669 --> 00:45:04.870
yes,

1143
00:45:04.949 --> 00:45:05.320
that's right.

1144
00:45:05.469 --> 00:45:06.389
There was a flood warning,

1145
00:45:06.469 --> 00:45:06.979
yes,

1146
00:45:07.709 --> 00:45:08.229
and you're saying,

1147
00:45:08.310 --> 00:45:08.459
yes,

1148
00:45:08.469 --> 00:45:10.310
you have to be careful because she's angry,

1149
00:45:10.389 --> 00:45:10.820
you know.

1150
00:45:11.729 --> 00:45:11.889
See,

1151
00:45:12.070 --> 00:45:12.560
because

1152
00:45:13.389 --> 00:45:14.679
England is also

1153
00:45:14.850 --> 00:45:15.489
the limit.

1154
00:45:20.229 --> 00:45:21.300
London are special.

1155
00:45:23.620 --> 00:45:23.649
Though

1156
00:45:24.649 --> 00:45:25.810
they have become more harmic,

1157
00:45:26.969 --> 00:45:27.909
isn't it?

1158
00:45:27.919 --> 00:45:28.929
It's not so bad now.

1159
00:45:29.050 --> 00:45:31.040
You don't find all those new things,

1160
00:45:33.469 --> 00:45:33.550
all that's not on the road,

1161
00:45:33.580 --> 00:45:33.600
you know,

1162
00:45:33.610 --> 00:45:35.159
punk rock is much less,

1163
00:45:37.969 --> 00:45:40.399
but I told you about the international thing.

1164
00:45:47.500 --> 00:45:48.959
International.

1165
00:45:50.530 --> 00:45:52.409
Exhibition we went to see in Rome.

1166
00:45:55.729 --> 00:45:57.000
They have very nice things there,

1167
00:45:57.090 --> 00:45:57.600
you see.

1168
00:45:57.850 --> 00:45:59.409
Some were selling some fur,

1169
00:45:59.540 --> 00:46:02.870
some were selling some things made in their own country,

1170
00:46:03.239 --> 00:46:04.149
some beads,

1171
00:46:04.540 --> 00:46:06.129
very nice handmade things in everything

1172
00:46:07.729 --> 00:46:08.800
and also

1173
00:46:09.169 --> 00:46:11.209
beautifully lavors and all that.

1174
00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:16.699
And suddenly they said there is this is the uh this is the

1175
00:46:17.669 --> 00:46:20.179
what you call stall of England.

1176
00:46:20.629 --> 00:46:22.179
So I deliberately went there.

1177
00:46:22.870 --> 00:46:24.120
What do you think it was a punk rock thing

1178
00:46:29.919 --> 00:46:31.590
you know 5 coloured pads,

1179
00:46:31.629 --> 00:46:33.439
4 coloured shirts,

1180
00:46:33.510 --> 00:46:34.409
these wigs,

1181
00:46:34.419 --> 00:46:35.100
all made with,

1182
00:46:35.830 --> 00:46:39.100
all made with hat and fuzzy fuzzy dresses for ladies,

1183
00:46:39.229 --> 00:46:39.739
you see.

1184
00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:42.830
As long as they don't think everybody in England is like that

1185
00:46:42.830 --> 00:46:45.399
I mean it is so bad of them to put it there.

1186
00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:46.489
I mean horrid,

1187
00:46:46.500 --> 00:46:48.429
and the one lady who was there,

1188
00:46:48.639 --> 00:46:50.169
she was wearing a very funny dress,

1189
00:46:50.639 --> 00:46:52.350
extremely funny and dude,

1190
00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:53.449
and the gentleman,

1191
00:46:53.600 --> 00:46:54.479
you didn't come that day.

1192
00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:55.320
Now you were not.

1193
00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:58.250
And the gentleman was wearing another.

1194
00:46:59.699 --> 00:47:01.469
like that cock like thing,

1195
00:47:01.580 --> 00:47:02.449
all coloured,

1196
00:47:02.899 --> 00:47:04.929
and they were doing a very dirty dance there,

1197
00:47:05.020 --> 00:47:06.250
very dirty dance,

1198
00:47:07.300 --> 00:47:08.070
and everybody was,

1199
00:47:08.260 --> 00:47:08.750
you see,

1200
00:47:08.820 --> 00:47:09.639
I think

1201
00:47:10.179 --> 00:47:12.370
Italians have a sense of ridicule.

1202
00:47:13.620 --> 00:47:15.129
They have a sense of ridicule,

1203
00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:16.489
and they were all

1204
00:47:17.100 --> 00:47:18.530
making fun of that.

1205
00:47:20.389 --> 00:47:21.429
All of them making fun of that.

1206
00:47:22.419 --> 00:47:23.260
Rome is.

1207
00:47:24.260 --> 00:47:26.010
It's got certain negative qualities,

1208
00:47:26.060 --> 00:47:26.969
but the general

1209
00:47:27.100 --> 00:47:27.889
quality of

1210
00:47:28.219 --> 00:47:29.780
people is they have a sense of serenity,

1211
00:47:29.860 --> 00:47:30.370
you see,

1212
00:47:31.419 --> 00:47:32.850
by photograph itself they

1213
00:47:35.060 --> 00:47:37.379
see to understand photographs to that extent.

1214
00:47:38.870 --> 00:47:41.669
And what respect and veneration they have for

1215
00:47:42.219 --> 00:47:45.159
thousands they were that day when we went to the big hat.

1216
00:47:46.020 --> 00:47:49.600
You should see the way they behaved and everyone got up and

1217
00:47:50.020 --> 00:47:51.139
so respectful.

1218
00:47:53.889 --> 00:47:58.209
They just wanted to come and touch or they didn't bother her with fix my knee,

1219
00:47:58.370 --> 00:47:59.129
fix my uncle,

1220
00:47:59.290 --> 00:48:00.199
fix my aunt.

1221
00:48:00.610 --> 00:48:02.699
Just touch her and walked away and

1222
00:48:17.679 --> 00:48:17.860
traditional traditional people's I think they are.

1223
00:48:17.889 --> 00:48:18.070
I think Egyptians have that Greeks,

1224
00:48:18.080 --> 00:48:18.889
Greek people have this traditional people,

1225
00:48:19.129 --> 00:48:19.689
whatever it is,

1226
00:48:19.699 --> 00:48:20.810
tradition is traditional.

1227
00:48:21.629 --> 00:48:23.340
They might have been horrid romances,

1228
00:48:23.629 --> 00:48:24.260
but you see,

1229
00:48:24.270 --> 00:48:24.870
by

1230
00:48:26.100 --> 00:48:26.889
By giving

1231
00:48:27.060 --> 00:48:28.449
for so many years,

1232
00:48:28.580 --> 00:48:31.120
you commit all the errors and you correct.

1233
00:48:31.540 --> 00:48:34.860
So I think traditional people improve and that's why in Europe,

1234
00:48:35.239 --> 00:48:37.590
England is the best as far as the young people.

1235
00:48:41.750 --> 00:48:42.770
We went to Cambridge.

1236
00:48:42.949 --> 00:48:44.790
Deal and myself went to Cambridge.

1237
00:48:45.270 --> 00:48:47.770
We had a really beautiful time there and

1238
00:48:48.350 --> 00:48:50.629
we just enjoyed the cathedral.

1239
00:48:50.719 --> 00:48:51.120
We

1240
00:48:51.510 --> 00:48:54.000
saw the beautiful painting in the cathedral of

1241
00:49:02.060 --> 00:49:03.280
the adoration of the Magi the whole place has seen you must see that cathedral.

1242
00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:04.070
That's

1243
00:49:04.870 --> 00:49:05.750
Cambridge University,

1244
00:49:05.989 --> 00:49:06.969
remember Melody,

1245
00:49:07.500 --> 00:49:08.739
from Cambridge University.

1246
00:49:09.399 --> 00:49:09.810
Yeah I came away.

1247
00:49:12.929 --> 00:49:14.040
First was horrible.

1248
00:49:14.370 --> 00:49:19.330
Second one was only there were 5 people out of them 3 ran away and the

1249
00:49:19.850 --> 00:49:21.360
4th 1 that was left,

1250
00:49:22.320 --> 00:49:22.330
um,

1251
00:49:22.409 --> 00:49:23.639
her boyfriend came

1252
00:49:24.010 --> 00:49:25.600
and she ran away too.

1253
00:49:25.810 --> 00:49:29.010
So only the one left was his wife,

1254
00:49:29.169 --> 00:49:29.370
you see,

1255
00:49:32.469 --> 00:49:33.840
she got a realisation and after that

1256
00:49:34.169 --> 00:49:35.850
I was so angry.

1257
00:49:37.110 --> 00:49:38.889
It rained and rained and lashed.

1258
00:49:39.290 --> 00:49:39.300
And

1259
00:49:41.479 --> 00:49:41.489
Mr.

1260
00:49:41.540 --> 00:49:43.250
Maya was so hard.

1261
00:49:43.820 --> 00:49:47.610
I haven't seen such tempest and it was in the papers that.

1262
00:49:48.129 --> 00:49:49.979
I had never known such lashes.

1263
00:49:52.729 --> 00:49:52.750
I mean,

1264
00:49:52.760 --> 00:49:53.889
and we were not all trouble,

1265
00:49:54.010 --> 00:49:54.280
you see,

1266
00:49:54.370 --> 00:49:57.169
our car was moving and the thing was behind us,

1267
00:49:57.350 --> 00:49:58.129
never touched,

1268
00:49:58.729 --> 00:49:59.250
no water,

1269
00:49:59.300 --> 00:50:00.639
nothing on our car.

1270
00:50:00.850 --> 00:50:03.360
But what I thought that instead of going to

1271
00:50:03.530 --> 00:50:04.129
London now,

1272
00:50:04.169 --> 00:50:04.989
let's go to

1273
00:50:05.209 --> 00:50:07.850
Northampton where our Jama was.

1274
00:50:07.929 --> 00:50:11.810
We went to his house and I cooked a meal for them and we all ate.

1275
00:50:15.100 --> 00:50:15.120
Oh yes,

1276
00:50:15.129 --> 00:50:15.169
he told me that.

1277
00:50:16.060 --> 00:50:16.709
No we love you.

1278
00:50:18.489 --> 00:50:22.679
I think it might be a good idea if we had ashrams that were outside London

1279
00:50:23.090 --> 00:50:25.780
but near enough for us to have programmes inside,

1280
00:50:25.810 --> 00:50:26.080
but

1281
00:50:26.370 --> 00:50:28.969
maybe it's something about living in Southern

1282
00:50:28.969 --> 00:50:31.169
people are actually living in London,

1283
00:50:31.250 --> 00:50:34.199
I think it's quite a problem actually being in the middle of it all.

1284
00:50:34.409 --> 00:50:36.909
But we can have it in the north of London.

1285
00:50:37.449 --> 00:50:38.800
Queen's Parks in the north.

1286
00:50:39.010 --> 00:50:39.360
Yes,

1287
00:50:39.530 --> 00:50:41.399
but if you're a little bit removed from it.

1288
00:50:41.810 --> 00:50:42.040
You know,

1289
00:50:42.139 --> 00:50:44.479
like you can go down to the city and work it out,

1290
00:50:44.560 --> 00:50:46.469
but then you can come out again and clear out,

1291
00:50:46.479 --> 00:50:46.870
whereas

1292
00:50:47.280 --> 00:50:48.300
when you're in the middle of

1293
00:50:48.639 --> 00:50:48.889
London,

1294
00:50:48.919 --> 00:50:49.159
it's,

1295
00:50:49.199 --> 00:50:50.469
it's quite difficult to

1296
00:50:50.840 --> 00:50:52.840
maintain that sort of serenity.

1297
00:50:52.889 --> 00:50:52.899
Yes.

1298
00:50:54.679 --> 00:50:56.469
But Soberton Sea was a good place,

1299
00:50:56.679 --> 00:51:00.090
but the people surrounding people were horrid and very aggressive,

1300
00:51:00.239 --> 00:51:02.070
typically of southern type of people.

1301
00:51:02.479 --> 00:51:03.800
first I lived in Oxted,

1302
00:51:03.879 --> 00:51:04.679
they were all like this,

1303
00:51:04.719 --> 00:51:05.229
you see.

1304
00:51:08.100 --> 00:51:08.159
Very adversity.

1305
00:51:10.020 --> 00:51:11.649
They're the real rights siders of England,

1306
00:51:11.780 --> 00:51:13.409
but the people in the Midlands are very,

1307
00:51:13.979 --> 00:51:14.729
are very

1308
00:51:14.979 --> 00:51:15.649
good people.

1309
00:51:16.580 --> 00:51:18.260
And the people in the north are too much though.

1310
00:51:18.419 --> 00:51:18.510
They,

1311
00:51:18.659 --> 00:51:19.090
they,

1312
00:51:19.419 --> 00:51:22.570
they overindulge the familiarity and,

1313
00:51:23.060 --> 00:51:23.739
you know.

1314
00:51:24.020 --> 00:51:24.169
Oh,

1315
00:51:24.219 --> 00:51:25.010
they are.

1316
00:51:27.429 --> 00:51:28.159
Drunk or Scotland,

1317
00:51:28.469 --> 00:51:29.840
we were going to this runoff place and

1318
00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:33.719
our train reached uh what time

1319
00:51:34.060 --> 00:51:36.379
about 12 o'clock and we had to

1320
00:51:37.070 --> 00:51:39.149
remember you were there at that time no not that first time when we went to Ronna,

1321
00:51:43.570 --> 00:51:45.709
and we had to take a train to go to Ronna,

1322
00:51:45.830 --> 00:51:46.459
you see,

1323
00:51:46.850 --> 00:51:47.550
and

1324
00:51:48.070 --> 00:51:49.790
they said you have to go from another station.

1325
00:51:49.870 --> 00:51:50.699
So we walked.

1326
00:51:51.120 --> 00:51:52.909
We wanted to know which side is the station.

1327
00:51:53.540 --> 00:51:56.260
But every person we met at that time,

1328
00:51:56.350 --> 00:51:57.820
about 12:30 or so,

1329
00:51:57.989 --> 00:51:58.590
was drunk.

1330
00:51:58.709 --> 00:52:02.219
Can you imagine drunk at 12:30 in the daytime.

1331
00:52:03.830 --> 00:52:04.260
Mhm

1332
00:52:05.929 --> 00:52:06.229
Yeah,

1333
00:52:06.310 --> 00:52:07.770
we just talked about sort of things.

1334
00:52:08.969 --> 00:52:09.629
Is this.

1335
00:52:11.020 --> 00:52:14.000
But we didn't know who to ask because we even fellow went

1336
00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:16.229
into the restaurant to ask so they were all drinking there,

1337
00:52:16.399 --> 00:52:18.310
so he came with a greater speed

1338
00:52:20.389 --> 00:52:20.419
than he had.

1339
00:52:25.090 --> 00:52:25.520
I started there.

1340
00:52:27.399 --> 00:52:29.189
Imagine what a place it must be.

1341
00:52:30.820 --> 00:52:31.439
Crazy.

1342
00:52:32.949 --> 00:52:32.959
Oh.

1343
00:52:38.899 --> 00:52:39.330
Delicious.

1344
00:52:44.550 --> 00:52:45.399
But it has

1345
00:52:46.750 --> 00:52:49.050
We have tried Scotland for governors.

1346
00:52:49.060 --> 00:52:50.860
He is very anxious about Scotland.

1347
00:52:53.100 --> 00:52:54.020
But this time we went there,

1348
00:52:54.100 --> 00:52:54.860
he came back and said,

1349
00:52:54.979 --> 00:52:55.100
Mother,

1350
00:52:55.179 --> 00:52:56.010
don't go.

1351
00:52:56.419 --> 00:52:58.370
Now please don't go to Scotland.

1352
00:52:58.620 --> 00:52:59.300
Where are you from?

1353
00:53:00.310 --> 00:53:01.610
I was born in London.

1354
00:53:08.870 --> 00:53:10.639
But they did well in that is.

1355
00:53:11.919 --> 00:53:14.070
Ireland they did well and again there was a,

1356
00:53:14.209 --> 00:53:14.399
you see,

1357
00:53:14.600 --> 00:53:16.760
because they were nobody was in contact,

1358
00:53:16.840 --> 00:53:18.689
so they wrote a letter saying that

1359
00:53:18.959 --> 00:53:20.840
mother should come once and this and that.

1360
00:53:20.919 --> 00:53:22.629
I said all right we'll see about it.

1361
00:53:23.360 --> 00:53:27.669
The thing about Ireland was with Dublin was that horrible psychiatrist

1362
00:53:28.199 --> 00:53:29.909
who was a friend of the family

1363
00:53:30.199 --> 00:53:31.780
who all got their realisation.

1364
00:53:31.919 --> 00:53:32.520
Do you remember?

1365
00:53:33.399 --> 00:53:33.709
He was,

1366
00:53:33.800 --> 00:53:35.429
he was a disciple of this.

1367
00:53:38.750 --> 00:53:40.389
You must have already got a heart attack,

1368
00:53:40.429 --> 00:53:40.750
I'm sure.

1369
00:53:41.669 --> 00:53:44.159
He was catching so much on the heart that time only

1370
00:53:46.939 --> 00:53:47.010
that was saying,

1371
00:53:47.020 --> 00:53:48.610
but he must be out already

1372
00:53:49.510 --> 00:53:50.260
the way he's having.

1373
00:53:50.379 --> 00:53:51.300
Don't pay your attention,

1374
00:53:51.340 --> 00:53:52.110
he said to him,

1375
00:53:52.159 --> 00:53:52.810
let him die.

1376
00:53:52.939 --> 00:53:53.919
We don't want,

1377
00:53:55.860 --> 00:53:58.169
he said he's catching so much on the heart

1378
00:53:58.379 --> 00:53:59.860
that he's not going to survive.

1379
00:54:03.449 --> 00:54:04.300
Wellta is doing well.

1380
00:54:05.679 --> 00:54:05.689
Mhm.

1381
00:54:06.760 --> 00:54:09.090
He is giving realisation to people.

1382
00:54:09.340 --> 00:54:11.409
You see what he says that he calls them

1383
00:54:11.939 --> 00:54:15.620
and he puts some sort of a cover on my photographs so they can't see it,

1384
00:54:15.629 --> 00:54:16.129
you see,

1385
00:54:16.300 --> 00:54:16.649
and they said,

1386
00:54:16.659 --> 00:54:18.429
now put your hand towards the wall,

1387
00:54:18.790 --> 00:54:19.969
like this.

1388
00:54:20.590 --> 00:54:23.169
Muslims Muslims like a blank wall.

1389
00:54:24.780 --> 00:54:24.800
They do.

1390
00:54:28.159 --> 00:54:29.280
And it gives them realisation.

1391
00:54:31.100 --> 00:54:32.179
He goes on the back.

1392
00:54:35.389 --> 00:54:37.020
You don't understand what's happening.

1393
00:54:37.179 --> 00:54:37.939
They're getting well,

1394
00:54:38.129 --> 00:54:39.260
mad people getting well,

1395
00:54:39.340 --> 00:54:40.280
alcoholics.
