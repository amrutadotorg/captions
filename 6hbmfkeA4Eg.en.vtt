00:00.450 --> 00:05.640
Please sit very comfortably that’s very
important.

00:05.640 --> 00:11.219
There should be no strain on a particular
part of the body.

00:11.219 --> 00:17.500
For example, when you are sitting sometimes
your feet might feel little bit numbed down,

00:17.500 --> 00:19.540
you can change the posture.

00:19.540 --> 00:25.930
You need not carry on with any extreme effort
or any discomfort to yourself, that’s first

00:25.930 --> 00:27.230
thing you must remember.

00:27.230 --> 00:35.140
Moreover some of the people go into tense
postures also by stretching their hands too

00:35.140 --> 00:41.990
straight or sometimes going very straight
or pushing their head behind.

00:41.990 --> 00:48.210
Sometimes they bend their heads also bit too
much also.

00:48.210 --> 00:53.329
Sit very comfortably with both the hands on
your lap in a very comfortable way.

00:53.329 --> 01:01.010
There should be nothing extreme to be done
from outside.

01:01.010 --> 01:07.549
We have to understand the principle of this
living process.

01:07.549 --> 01:15.979
Then you will know that why I say: “No use
doing any such extreme thing to achieve your

01:15.979 --> 01:17.469
goal”.

01:17.469 --> 01:29.579
The principle is like this: that this room
is all dirty supposing or it’s in a chaos,

01:29.579 --> 01:33.570
or maybe it’s in darkness completely, you
can’t see anything.

01:33.570 --> 01:36.109
So you enter inside the room.

01:36.109 --> 01:42.310
Your goal is to achieve the enlightenment.

01:42.310 --> 01:51.079
Some people will say that: “Let us clean
the room in darkness with blindness”.

01:51.079 --> 01:58.920
You start cleaning your body you don’t know
what you are cleaning!

01:58.920 --> 02:03.009
So there is no need to bother about cleaning
when you are blind.

02:03.009 --> 02:11.510
Some people think: “If you clear your mind
before Realization you will be better off."

02:11.510 --> 02:17.490
You have tried all those things, but in doing
so, you have gone to extremes.

02:17.490 --> 02:24.799
It’s all blindness, all your work is done
in darkness, there is no enlightenment.

02:24.799 --> 02:32.000
You have to get your enlightenment first,
this is what I have realized that unless and

02:32.000 --> 02:36.910
until human beings are enlightened they cannot
cleanse themselves properly, they cannot understand

02:36.910 --> 02:43.730
Sahaja Yoga, they cannot understand God, they
cannot understand feel their Spirit, nothing

02:43.730 --> 02:46.239
is possible unless and until they are enlightened.

02:46.239 --> 02:54.629
It is possible then, when you get the enlightenment,
you might find that the light is not coming

02:54.629 --> 03:01.359
through properly, there is some shaking in
the bulb or may be there is some shaking in

03:01.359 --> 03:08.189
the shade or maybe that the room is dirty,
that you cannot see things clearly, that you

03:08.189 --> 03:11.709
cannot see your image in the mirror, your
eyes are weak.

03:11.709 --> 03:15.379
For all this you need a bright light.

03:15.379 --> 03:23.900
But without getting the light itself, without
knowing something about what you have got

03:23.900 --> 03:28.739
within yourself, how are you going to cleanse
yourself?

03:28.739 --> 03:35.220
Of course the light may be dim but still you
can see what is the problem, what is to be

03:35.220 --> 03:38.630
done, what is to be cleared out.

03:38.630 --> 03:41.010
That’s why enlightenment is the first thing.

03:41.010 --> 03:44.930
Now for this, even if you clean the whole
room, even if you do all that, you have not

03:44.930 --> 03:46.799
done the perfect job.

03:46.799 --> 03:51.769
On the contrary you might break some things,
you might spoil some things, you may slip

03:51.769 --> 03:58.109
down, anything can happen in darkness that’s
what happens to people when they do any sadhana

03:58.109 --> 03:59.109
blindly.

03:59.109 --> 04:04.209
After your enlightenment you know your way
through, you know how to go about it and you

04:04.209 --> 04:05.319
understand everything.

04:05.319 --> 04:13.920
Then another myth we have is that if we cleanse
our mind, we can achieve our spirituality,

04:13.920 --> 04:14.920
you can’t.

04:14.920 --> 04:18.412
Even if this room may be clean unless and
until there is light there cannot be enlightenment.

04:18.412 --> 04:22.370
So the main thing is you have to have an enlightenment.

04:22.370 --> 04:26.530
I have known people who lead very clean and
a good life.

04:26.530 --> 04:33.352
When they get enlightenment they get it very
fast and have it nicely established, very

04:33.352 --> 04:34.640
easily and it is there.

04:34.640 --> 04:42.010
But some of the people who lead a very clean
and a good life have overdone it to such an

04:42.010 --> 04:44.860
extent that they have an ego about it, they
think: “I don’t want anything, I am perfect,

04:44.860 --> 04:50.370
I do no wrong, I am committing no problem,
I am a very happy person”.

04:50.370 --> 04:55.570
Such people also get stuck because they do
not want the higher things of life.

04:55.570 --> 05:02.030
They do not want their Spirit to be enlightened
so that also sometimes become a very sticky

05:02.030 --> 05:03.030
point.

05:03.030 --> 05:10.250
Now in Sahaja Yoga, you have to know that
you have the power within yourself.

05:10.250 --> 05:15.690
It is there, it exists there, and it is to
be just awakened.

05:15.690 --> 05:19.860
In some people, it takes time to be awakened.

05:19.860 --> 05:24.030
In thousands I have seen it takes no time.

05:24.030 --> 05:29.590
The only thing that I would suggest is to
keep your mind open, not to become obstinate

05:29.590 --> 05:30.590
about things.

05:30.590 --> 05:34.810
If you are an obstinate person, the Kundalini
is even a greater obstinate thing.

05:34.810 --> 05:42.100
Do not be obstinate, just keep yourself open,
do not argue it out by argument or by thinking

05:42.100 --> 05:44.310
about it, the Kundalini is not going to be
awakened.

05:44.310 --> 05:49.290
On the contrary when the Kundalini is awakened
your thoughts settle down to such an extent

05:49.290 --> 05:54.160
that you feel there is no thought coming to
you from your subconscious or from your supraconscious.

05:54.160 --> 06:03.210
So try to keep yourself absolutely open and
don’t worry even if your vibrations are

06:03.210 --> 06:04.560
not felt.

06:04.560 --> 06:09.690
The principle is that light is light and the
room is room.

06:09.690 --> 06:12.530
The light has nothing to do with the room.

06:12.530 --> 06:18.910
Only thing, when the light is enlightened,
it enlightens the room.

06:18.910 --> 06:23.620
The room has something to do with the light,
but the light has nothing to do: whether the

06:23.620 --> 06:25.850
room is there or not, light exists.

06:25.850 --> 06:31.970
In the same way, we must understand that the
relationship with the atman and our body our

06:31.970 --> 06:35.360
Spirit and our this body, mind, and our ego,
superego.

06:35.360 --> 06:44.170
So many of
you must have done lot of tapasyas and lot

06:44.170 --> 06:50.340
of things which were not really wanted, thinking
that you have done such a lot, you have been

06:50.340 --> 06:53.530
to so many places, you have done so much “tirtha
yatra” [acetic; journey] you have been to

06:53.530 --> 06:58.750
so many pilgrimages and those pilgrimages
and all these places, you think according

06:58.750 --> 07:02.100
to you, it should be blissful to you.

07:02.100 --> 07:09.220
But actually, while going there, you did not
know how to get the bliss from those temple

07:09.220 --> 07:15.320
and those places which are holy actually in
nature but are surrounded by people who are

07:15.320 --> 07:16.320
extremely negative.

07:16.320 --> 07:20.630
Because of that, that mixture was there and
sometimes instead of getting the bliss you

07:20.630 --> 07:23.470
get the headaches.

07:23.470 --> 07:26.120
7:23

07:26.120 --> 07:43.780
Today we are going to discuss the Void what
we call Void in Sahaja Yoga is different from

07:43.780 --> 07:45.490
the way people talk of void.

07:45.490 --> 07:54.310
Void is the complete visceral cavity which
is called in Sahaja Yoga language as Bhavasagara.

07:54.310 --> 08:06.500
Many a times, you must have heard people singing
songs poets singing songs saying “Bhavasagara

08:06.500 --> 08:10.640
se para utaru”
What is this Bhavasagara?

08:10.640 --> 08:23.500
This is the symbol or this is the reflection
of the whole entire universe that is created.

08:23.500 --> 08:29.540
This all universe is created by Brahmadeva.

08:29.540 --> 08:37.530
He is the one who is the creator, who is a
“raksna yeta” [unsure] of this world,

08:37.530 --> 08:42.780
who created this beautiful universe, in that
especially he created the Mother earth.

08:42.780 --> 08:51.820
He has placed the Moon and the Sun on both
the sides of this Mother earth and the representatives

08:51.820 --> 08:57.030
of the Mother earth within us is the Kundalini,
the Mooladhara.

08:57.030 --> 09:12.260
Now this universe exists within us, that
is the Bhavasagara.

09:12.260 --> 09:17.730
This Bhavasagara exists in many stages in
its evolutionary form and today it is Kali

09:17.730 --> 09:21.570
Yuga in this Bhavasagara.

09:21.570 --> 09:28.060
I would say it is the dawn of Satya Yuga and
the end of Kali Yuga.

09:28.060 --> 09:37.170
And this Bhavasagara is placed in the centre-
is the center of Nabhi, Nabhi charka.

09:37.170 --> 09:41.240
And around it, moves the center of Swadhisthana.

09:41.240 --> 09:51.980
Nabhi chakra as you know is governed by Shri
Lakshmi as the power of Shri Vishnu and the

09:51.980 --> 10:03.240
Swadhisthana moves around it, which delimits
our own personality, and which creates all

10:03.240 --> 10:09.370
these different stars within us or the planets
within us.

10:09.370 --> 10:29.490
In these spaces, Void, are born the incarnations
of the Primordial Master who is called as

10:29.490 --> 10:30.490
Dattatreya.

10:30.490 --> 10:40.220
Dattatreya is the innocence of Shiva of – “Vibrations
itni hai ikura” [Vibrations are so cool]-

10:40.220 --> 10:45.710
of Brahmadeva and of Shri Vishnu.

10:45.710 --> 10:58.680
Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh, the essence of these,
the innocence of these is embodied in the

10:58.680 --> 11:03.650
form of Dattatreya, who is the Primordial
Master.

11:03.650 --> 11:18.450
So these masters who are born on this Earth
are innocence at its best, all integrated

11:18.450 --> 11:19.450
together.

11:19.450 --> 11:24.920
These masters have incarnated on this Earth
mainly ten times, but there have been many

11:24.920 --> 11:28.960
others incarnations also, there have been
repetitions just to correct themselves.

11:28.960 --> 11:36.310
As I told you yesterday that Mohammad Saab
and Nanaka are both the same personalities

11:36.310 --> 11:37.370
of Dattatreya.

11:37.370 --> 11:46.840
The instance is given, in the life of Guru
Nanaka, when he was sleeping people told him

11:46.840 --> 11:49.960
that your feet are towards Mecca, Kaaba towards
Kaaba.

11:49.960 --> 11:54.020
He said: “Alright I’ll remove my feet
and put wherever you say”.

11:54.020 --> 12:01.750
Then they put his feet towards the other side
and again they found that his feet were facing

12:01.750 --> 12:02.750
towards Kaaba.

12:02.750 --> 12:07.050
Then he said: “Tell me the place where there
is no Kaaba I’ll put my feet!”

12:07.050 --> 12:13.430
But they couldn’t arrange it at all, because
wherever he placed his feet, it was such a

12:13.430 --> 12:17.130
Maya, that always they found that the feet
were towards Kaaba.

12:17.130 --> 12:26.100
Now Kaaba is a place where you have a beautiful
Shiva linga, which is called as Mekkaeshwar

12:26.100 --> 12:28.000
Shiva in our Puranas.

12:28.000 --> 12:36.180
From ancient times it is mentioned that, there
is a pinda which is absolutely Vibrating and

12:36.180 --> 12:37.690
which is there.

12:37.690 --> 12:42.020
Now Mohammad Saab religiously avoided talking
about that.

12:42.020 --> 12:47.089
He only said: “If this stone can be so godly,
why not human beings be?”

12:47.089 --> 12:54.370
But he did not explained much as it is whatever
he tried to explain, the people were so insensitive

12:54.370 --> 13:00.770
and so cruel that they tried to kill him many
a times, they to gave him poison, ultimately

13:00.770 --> 13:03.760
he died in a very, very bad state.

13:03.760 --> 13:09.830
They tortured his life, they were lunatic
people, they used to live in tribes and very

13:09.830 --> 13:11.089
tribal by nature.

13:11.089 --> 13:17.779
And they- he tried his level best to propagate
that there is God and God is above all and

13:17.779 --> 13:22.770
I am the messenger of God, but they would
not listen to him.

13:22.770 --> 13:32.110
Then came, you know Nanaka who preached that
there should be no enmity between Hindus and

13:32.110 --> 13:36.810
Muslims, he preached that, because he saw
the Muslims behaving in such a manner, they

13:36.810 --> 13:40.130
were such fanatics and they had become so
funny that he could not understand how is

13:40.130 --> 13:41.130
it?

13:41.130 --> 13:44.410
These are the people whom I have made Muslims
and what are they doing here?

13:44.410 --> 13:51.510
Actually Musalman means the person who is
realized and Peer is a person whose realization

13:51.510 --> 13:57.050
is established so much so that he said that
those who have become Musalman should be buried

13:57.050 --> 14:02.160
and not burnt, because he thought they are
all realized souls, but realization finished

14:02.160 --> 14:08.820
off with his son in law and his daughter,
after that he had two sons who were great

14:08.820 --> 14:11.310
souls who are really the reincarnations of
Lov and Kush.

14:11.310 --> 14:15.560
Now perhaps we do not know what happened to
Luv and Kush when they were born.

14:15.560 --> 14:20.960
Luv and Kush when their mother disappeared
in the Mother Earth and the father, they were

14:20.960 --> 14:28.230
little annoyed with them, went in the North
one went to Caucasus and another went to China.

14:28.230 --> 14:35.230
Luv went to Caucasus and from there he became
a very powerful king in Russia.

14:35.230 --> 14:40.110
Russians always use Sanskrit language; we
do not know how much Sanskrit they use; for

14:40.110 --> 14:46.990
example they will say kharoshou means Harushivaye
the Pravada itself the word Pravada vda is

14:46.990 --> 14:51.470
to say pra means enlightened.

14:51.470 --> 14:55.480
You see their language, it’s full of Sanskrit
words, practically it is absolutely based

14:55.480 --> 15:00.750
on Sanskrit and you’d say slaws people…slaws,
so lov sla…

15:00.750 --> 15:08.010
Luv ruled there for years together and about
four hundred years back, his very descendants

15:08.010 --> 15:15.740
flew away from there, went to Iran, where
there is a Goddess, Goddess Hindolika’s

15:15.740 --> 15:20.500
temple is there which is all described in
the Puranas, where they used to worship Goddess

15:20.500 --> 15:25.730
Hindolika, from there they came down and spread
all over, it’s a big story.

15:25.730 --> 15:31.360
Then Kush went to China, that’s how you
have Kushan in China and Chinese language

15:31.360 --> 15:37.860
is very much near Sanskrit and quite close
to Marathi language, it’s more surprising

15:37.860 --> 15:43.899
if you hear them talking, for example they
say; Ma tza tum , tza is only there in Marathi

15:43.899 --> 15:48.000
language they use this word tza, we never
say in Hindi tza or in any other language

15:48.000 --> 15:52.959
you wont find it tza but only in Chinese and
in Marathi language they have this word, tza.

15:52.959 --> 16:00.100
It’s very interesting to see, how the spirituality
has spread into these countries and then how

16:00.100 --> 16:01.290
it died out.

16:01.290 --> 16:10.520
All these things happened, but then they were
born again and again, they were born as Mahavira

16:10.520 --> 16:19.370
and Buddha, they are the same, they are born
as Markendeya, they are born as Kabira, as

16:19.370 --> 16:24.990
Adishankaracharya, it was Buddha who was born
as Adishankaracharya just to correct himself,

16:24.990 --> 16:30.810
Buddha was shocked the way people were going,
there was Nirakara that he had be born as

16:30.810 --> 16:33.760
Shankaracharaya to tell people, oh God, what
are you doing?

16:33.760 --> 16:39.930
It was only Buddha who came to correct himself
as Shankaracharaya, it is so surprising, that

16:39.930 --> 16:47.740
people are fighting, Buddhist and Hindus are
great enemies of each other, but they do not

16:47.740 --> 16:54.640
know that the person who really re-established
Hinduism was the same who established Buddhism.

16:54.640 --> 17:01.300
So imagine the same personality coming again
and again on this Earth tries to correct his

17:01.300 --> 17:08.789
disciples again finds that there are two groups
he has created, it’s a big problem.

17:08.789 --> 17:16.149
Now Mahavira also was one of them, who was
born again and again and he was Markendeya

17:16.149 --> 17:22.699
and he was Kabira, the way Kabira lashes people
you can see that he is tremendous, he is like

17:22.699 --> 17:27.999
Bhairava and the power of Bhairava, Kabira
has used in his language, but for Hindi poets

17:27.999 --> 17:30.080
it is Sadhukadi and they have made fun of
it.

17:30.080 --> 17:36.059
The best thing of a person who doesn’t want
to face reality, is to make fun of everyone,

17:36.059 --> 17:39.220
that is the best way, they said what is this
talk Ida, Pingla, Sushumna?

17:39.220 --> 17:40.220
Who is he?

17:40.220 --> 17:41.330
What does he think of himself?

17:41.330 --> 17:46.650
But he was appreciated very much, by the saints
and especially by Guru Nanaka, who included

17:46.650 --> 17:51.669
all his poetry in his Grantha sahib; he’s
included so many of these poetry from all

17:51.669 --> 17:54.330
the realized souls from Maharashtra, also.

17:54.330 --> 18:00.389
But I wonder how many Sikhs know that this
was for getting realization, he thought, if

18:00.389 --> 18:03.980
you write an Upanishad, [not clear_] they
try to correct everything just to make people

18:03.980 --> 18:06.749
understand that you have to get to it.

18:06.749 --> 18:10.669
First, they thought that if you write Gita,
they go on remembering Gita by heart.

18:10.669 --> 18:15.519
Then, they thought it is better, that you
write something from the realized souls only

18:15.519 --> 18:19.460
together, so that it is a powerful Grantha
by which people when they read it they get

18:19.460 --> 18:24.119
Vibrations and they’ll stick to it, but
it is not so, even there people are just reading

18:24.119 --> 18:25.119
it.

18:25.119 --> 18:26.119
I don’t know how?

18:26.119 --> 18:29.210
Gradually as we were revolving, we were losing
our sensitivity.

18:29.210 --> 18:33.210
At least in the time of Rama, people knew
he was an incarnation.

18:33.210 --> 18:36.789
At the time of Krishna they knew he was an
incarnation.

18:36.789 --> 18:40.940
Many people know, of course, Raksasha knew
also that they were incarnations; raksasha’s

18:40.940 --> 18:46.309
even today know who the incarnation they are
very sure of it and they are just frightened

18:46.309 --> 18:51.029
of, but in those days, even common people
knew who is an incarnation.

18:51.029 --> 18:57.899
Now the sensitivity among human beings started
getting reduced and reduced as they got involved

18:57.899 --> 19:04.030
into fanaticism, all kinds of tantrism that
developed in this country of ours, in other

19:04.030 --> 19:09.200
countries also, tremendous movement was there
to create fanatics and these fanatics are

19:09.200 --> 19:14.980
diseased people, they are diseased, they are
actually the people who are possessed absolutely

19:14.980 --> 19:19.399
possessed, they are not normal people when
they talk, you are surprised, how can they

19:19.399 --> 19:20.990
talk like that?

19:20.990 --> 19:25.860
When they do not know anything about it, but
thank God today, fanaticism has reached such

19:25.860 --> 19:30.789
a stage that the younger people are understanding
the nonsense of it.

19:30.789 --> 19:34.999
It’s a very good chance for Sahaja Yoga
to come up.

19:34.999 --> 19:42.019
In Sahaja Yoga, the beauty is this, that you
cannot now form a cult as soon as you try

19:42.019 --> 19:48.259
to do such a thing, you loose your vibrations,
you try any such tricks, you try to be fanatic

19:48.259 --> 19:56.980
you will be losing all your vibrations, any
tricks you try with Sahaja Yoga first thing

19:56.980 --> 20:00.860
you will loose your vibrations, you wont like
it, you won’t be happy with it, you would

20:00.860 --> 20:08.279
like to keep your vibrations going, smooth,
smoothly and nicely so that you feel absolutely

20:08.279 --> 20:14.000
happy about it and joyous, but anybody who
tries any tricks with Sahaja Yoga, you get

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
into problem.

20:15.000 --> 20:21.730
Now these Gurus came on this Earth to remove
fanaticism, the last of them came as Shirdi

20:21.730 --> 20:28.900
Sai Nath, he was the one who had said very
clearly, in Marathi he had said it, that to

20:28.900 --> 20:36.970
speak ill of any other religion is sin, is
sin, nothing can be more powerful than that.

20:36.970 --> 20:40.600
There are many people who worship Sai Nath,
many people, but they drink, he was against

20:40.600 --> 20:45.980
drinking, all of them were against drinking,
why were they against drinking because the

20:45.980 --> 20:48.570
awareness is spread in your void.

20:48.570 --> 20:57.720
The awareness, the Chitta, the attention is
in your void and is nourished by your liver.

20:57.720 --> 21:03.200
The liver takes out all the poison from your
awareness, due to bad health, due to bad mind,

21:03.200 --> 21:09.359
due to anything from bad effects or negativity
and then it clears out as I told you yesterday.

21:09.359 --> 21:15.119
So this awareness within us gets, you know
that our awareness, human awareness goes down

21:15.119 --> 21:18.809
through drinking, these people preach that
you should not drink.

21:18.809 --> 21:22.549
I mean that the one thing that they all preached
together, that you should not drink.

21:22.549 --> 21:27.019
At the time of Mohammad Saab there was no
smoking, so Guru Nanaka also [not clear] this

21:27.019 --> 21:32.139
time you found people smoking with big big
hookah’s, he said that now for heaven sake

21:32.139 --> 21:37.830
do not smoke, because they said that you just
said that don’t drink, so we will smoke

21:37.830 --> 21:38.830
now.

21:38.830 --> 21:42.109
Like in England, people say what’s wrong
in drugs?

21:42.109 --> 21:49.539
Drugs were not approached by saints, so we
can take drugs, so it is in my lot, to tell

21:49.539 --> 21:54.190
them, now drugs are the same; anything that
goes against awareness is not good.

21:54.190 --> 21:59.909
I mean, it is not something that you have
said no because they were mad people, whatever

21:59.909 --> 22:03.940
they said, they said because it was the truth.

22:03.940 --> 22:09.929
If you take drinks of any kind, alcoholics
or any these kinds, anything that takes you

22:09.929 --> 22:16.639
away from your awareness is wrong because
your awareness is to be enlightened as it

22:16.639 --> 22:24.049
is your awareness is like that and on top
of that if this awareness is to be enlightened

22:24.049 --> 22:27.000
and is full of alcoholism, how to raise it?

22:27.000 --> 22:28.009
How to do it?

22:28.009 --> 22:32.679
But these days to talk against alcoholism,
one person asked Me, “Mother are you going

22:32.679 --> 22:34.859
to be minister of permission?”

22:34.859 --> 22:41.580
I mean, it is impossible to talk to people
about anything sensible.

22:41.580 --> 22:45.169
Even in a party you go, they say why don’t
you drink?

22:45.169 --> 22:48.749
You should drink, you are missing such a great
thing, you have missed such a lot in your

22:48.749 --> 22:53.299
life, I said I have drunk from my childhood,
don’t give Me anything I don’t need it,

22:53.299 --> 22:56.230
no, they’ll go on forcing, you must drink.

22:56.230 --> 22:59.390
You see, this is a special thing, that is
thing and all that.

22:59.390 --> 23:01.760
They have no shame about it, no shame.

23:01.760 --> 23:07.059
They think they are trying to be nice and
you tell them even once if you say.

23:07.059 --> 23:08.830
Why do you drink?

23:08.830 --> 23:11.650
Gone, you are the gone case, you have no manners.

23:11.650 --> 23:12.669
You are the most unmannerly person.

23:12.669 --> 23:14.480
How dare you say such a thing to anyone?

23:14.480 --> 23:20.890
Look at these human beings, such [not clear_],
I don’t know how to deal with them?

23:20.890 --> 23:26.710
They think that they should be told, “alright
go ahead drink, kill your self”.

23:26.710 --> 23:28.730
How can you be saints allowed you to drink?

23:28.730 --> 23:32.720
Tell Me, when they know that it goes against
your awareness, of course these thugs will

23:32.720 --> 23:37.240
say “alright drink as much as you like,
do what you please, you have ten wives or

23:37.240 --> 23:43.460
you do what you please, only give me your
purse to me”, because that is their interest

23:43.460 --> 23:44.460
in you.

23:44.460 --> 23:47.529
They are only interested in your purse, how
much money you have got in your purse?

23:47.529 --> 23:49.190
What job you are doing?

23:49.190 --> 23:57.929
Or at times they can be, officers, saying
that, give job to my son or give job to someone.

23:57.929 --> 24:07.249
One has to understand that saint is not afraid
of anyone, he cannot be, it’s a fearless

24:07.249 --> 24:13.519
entity absolutely fearless, it’s not afraid
of anyone because it is standing on truth,

24:13.519 --> 24:20.789
truth itself gives you that strength to say
the truth, but I have learnt certain lessons,

24:20.789 --> 24:25.090
in my past lives that human beings don’t
like truth, don’t tell them, if you tell

24:25.090 --> 24:26.090
them they will crucify you, immediately.

24:26.090 --> 24:31.629
You have to go round and round and put them
into problem so that they come along.

24:31.629 --> 24:36.700
If you tell them straight forward don’t
do something, they will put you, I mean, people

24:36.700 --> 24:41.649
may crucify Me after sometime, if I tell them
don’t drink, it is that bad these days.

24:41.649 --> 24:48.320
The drinking in England is so bad now that
English, who used to drink so little, is now

24:48.320 --> 24:51.190
nothing but a bottle, since morning he starts
it.

24:51.190 --> 24:55.090
In third generation you go down, what about
our Indians who have gone there?

24:55.090 --> 24:59.720
Even the Sikhs, who are told not to drink,
drink more than Scotch people can drink.

24:59.720 --> 25:03.700
It’s a shameful thing and they will fight
that we’ll not put a helmet on our head,

25:03.700 --> 25:06.090
to save our head from going on a motorbike.

25:06.090 --> 25:10.019
Is it written in any Grantha Sahib like this
to be foolish and stupid?

25:10.019 --> 25:14.799
But they will fight for that, but not fight
for this, that no Sikh should drink.

25:14.799 --> 25:19.419
If you are wearing that pagadi, you have no
business to drink.

25:19.419 --> 25:24.239
They don’t think that the essence of religion
is more important, than all these nonsensical

25:24.239 --> 25:26.559
things that you think you are doing.

25:26.559 --> 25:33.779
Such a great religion, Islam, such a great
religion is Sikhism, such a great religion

25:33.779 --> 25:36.720
is Hinduism, such a great religion is Christianity.

25:36.720 --> 25:41.119
Everything gone to dogs because the dogs have
come into it.

25:41.119 --> 25:45.690
They have no sense of proportion; they do
not know how to respect their Guru’s…

25:45.690 --> 25:50.539
in the right way putting their guru’s in
their heart and in their behavior.

25:50.539 --> 25:53.070
That’s all they should have done.

25:53.070 --> 25:54.529
They should have just obeyed their Guru’s.

25:54.529 --> 25:59.039
There was no need to stand on your heads and
take mantras from these thugs paying them.

25:59.039 --> 26:03.789
There was no need at all to do all these things,
but no they thought that here we are doing

26:03.789 --> 26:07.749
black market money, let us make some big temples
so there are great Hindus, big temples are

26:07.749 --> 26:09.149
built, black market money going on.

26:09.149 --> 26:16.629
Here they are killing so many people the Muslims,
so they must say that we are doing it in the

26:16.629 --> 26:18.889
name of God, very nice.

26:18.889 --> 26:24.649
Where Mohammad Saab has talked of nothing
but Rehmat and Rahim, all the time Rehmat

26:24.649 --> 26:29.889
and Rahim he has talked of, see they were
about to kill him every moment wherever he

26:29.889 --> 26:36.549
went, it was such a dangerous situation, so
vicariously he was living and he had to defend

26:36.549 --> 26:38.019
himself.

26:38.019 --> 26:44.929
So now we have to defend ourselves from these
people, instead of these people defending

26:44.929 --> 26:45.929
themselves.

26:45.929 --> 26:51.369
It’s not in defense; it is in aggression,
these people are killing others and they think

26:51.369 --> 26:56.080
they are doing a great very great service
to the people.

26:56.080 --> 27:01.369
Then the Christians, they are one of the worst
fanatics worst fanatics are the Christians

27:01.369 --> 27:05.820
There cannot be worst fanatics than Christianity.

27:05.820 --> 27:10.680
Christianity is one religion which is very
clever and cunning, nobody can beat them all.

27:10.680 --> 27:11.680
For example they will do all missionary work.

27:11.680 --> 27:15.210
You’ll say ha a ha a ha what nice people.

27:15.210 --> 27:23.369
The missionary work, they are looking after
our poor people here, very nice people very

27:23.369 --> 27:27.799
great generous people and they will be converting
people.

27:27.799 --> 27:29.779
What are you converting them for?

27:29.779 --> 27:31.860
Have you got the power of realization?

27:31.860 --> 27:35.440
Have you got the power to call yourself Christian?

27:35.440 --> 27:38.220
Are you baptized in the real sense?

27:38.220 --> 27:41.629
That is how the Christians have been behaving
throughout.

27:41.629 --> 27:46.470
They have put up such a big show, this is
not God’s work, to get some people from

27:46.470 --> 27:49.179
the street who are dying put them in the room
and look after them.

27:49.179 --> 27:51.080
Is this the work of God?

27:51.080 --> 27:53.980
This the work of human beings?

27:53.980 --> 27:59.389
Work of God is just to raise the Kundalini
that is the work of God.

27:59.389 --> 28:02.999
Not the work of God is to have Hospitals and
Schools and things.

28:02.999 --> 28:11.570
This is not the work of God, this is your
job, this is you are doing it, but they are

28:11.570 --> 28:14.029
taking the name of God to earn money.

28:14.029 --> 28:17.570
In the name of God give me money.

28:17.570 --> 28:21.590
Such beggars I tell you of the first waters.

28:21.590 --> 28:26.419
Begging a man, who believes in God, will never
do.

28:26.419 --> 28:27.859
Why to beg?

28:27.859 --> 28:29.200
Why to ask for money?

28:29.200 --> 28:32.549
On the streets they will stand, nowadays our
Hare Rama and Hare Krishna in Oxford Street

28:32.549 --> 28:34.809
and beg money, in the name of God.

28:34.809 --> 28:41.080
Can there be greater sinners than these who
beg in the name of God and get money from

28:41.080 --> 28:43.820
others and live on other people’s money?

28:43.820 --> 28:44.989
All the time like parasites.

28:44.989 --> 28:50.099
This is they have done out of religion, or
ritualism go to the temples, there’s a priest

28:50.099 --> 28:52.889
standing there he gives you ghanta, he makes
something, puts something on your head, God

28:52.889 --> 28:54.849
knows he spoils the Agnya charka or what he
does?

28:54.849 --> 28:59.619
and you think “oh I have been to this temple,
I have been to that temple, I have been to

28:59.619 --> 29:07.099
this Teerath and that teerath and that teerath
and I have been a very religious man”.

29:07.099 --> 29:14.419
I tell you these extreme ideas about God has
really blinded us completely from reality.

29:14.419 --> 29:19.639
If you want the reality, you must know that
God is to be found within your heart and not

29:19.639 --> 29:20.639
in those places.

29:20.639 --> 29:24.619
Once you have found it in your heart then
you will know that where is the real God in

29:24.619 --> 29:27.200
which temple and how to approach.

29:27.200 --> 29:37.759
Now if I ask you, In Delhi how many temples
are really jaagrut, except for Sahaja yogis

29:37.759 --> 29:44.769
nobody can say, you see a stone namaste another
stone might have been brought from some bathroom

29:44.769 --> 29:45.769
namaste.

29:45.769 --> 29:49.450
Is that a real jaagrut one?

29:49.450 --> 29:59.159
It is said in the Bible that whatever is produced,
created by mother Earth and by the Sky should

29:59.159 --> 30:01.899
not be reproduced, now what is that is created?

30:01.899 --> 30:05.610
What is that is created by Mother Earth?

30:05.610 --> 30:15.549
We Indians know these are the jaagrut deities
which are created by Mother Earth, these are

30:15.549 --> 30:24.710
the jaagrut deities and that is to be worshipped
and not to get a Ganapati somewhere for 2

30:24.710 --> 30:28.139
rupees, my forefathers have given me so I
am carrying on.

30:28.139 --> 30:32.759
I must do their Puja, maybe the forefathers
are sitting on that.

30:32.759 --> 30:35.710
You won’t believe, there is a gentleman
in Bombay, who came to Me, to meet Me, his

30:35.710 --> 30:36.710
name is Mr.

30:36.710 --> 30:40.480
Shah, he said “Mother Lot’s of things
are happening, I don’t know how?”

30:40.480 --> 30:42.169
I said what happened?

30:42.169 --> 30:48.379
“In my house I am getting some old deities
from somewhere, just coming into my house

30:48.379 --> 30:51.029
from somewhere, I don’t know where from
where it comes?

30:51.029 --> 30:56.419
Sometimes I keep my windows open in the night
and I find in the morning there is a deity

30:56.419 --> 31:00.679
of silver sometimes diamonds are there in
the nose of the Lakshmi and I am surprised

31:00.679 --> 31:02.200
how am I getting it?”

31:02.200 --> 31:06.539
And the man is not so rich to have all these
things; he showed me and said now what to

31:06.539 --> 31:07.539
do?

31:07.539 --> 31:09.080
I told him; throw them all of them in the
sea, that’s what they deserve.

31:09.080 --> 31:10.620
He said from where have they come?

31:10.620 --> 31:15.749
These are the people who have habit of very
seriously worshipping those deities, without

31:15.749 --> 31:19.309
understanding that these deities have got
vibrations or not, whether they are jaagrut

31:19.309 --> 31:20.600
or not, they are alright or not.

31:20.600 --> 31:24.480
Even a plastic they’ll make, they’ll make
of aluminum.

31:24.480 --> 31:29.239
I don’t know now what they are going to
use next to make a deity and they will be

31:29.239 --> 31:33.929
carrying it on, have no value, have no understanding,
have no respect.

31:33.929 --> 31:40.590
So the people who own those, they must be
bringing it, the old people and putting in

31:40.590 --> 31:44.620
your house, so better put them in the sea,
otherwise they will not have their Mukti and

31:44.620 --> 31:46.350
this fellow is having greediness.

31:46.350 --> 31:47.690
He is always having a chakkar with these things.

31:47.690 --> 31:49.500
He said “what is happening to me?”

31:49.500 --> 31:50.710
His child is getting into problem; his wife
has run away from the house.

31:50.710 --> 31:55.879
All kinds of problems coming up, lost all
his money, every sort of problem coming up

31:55.879 --> 32:03.090
and this deity is coming in he said, should
I sell them and get some money.

32:03.090 --> 32:06.989
I said please don’t do it, to whomsoever
you will sell, you will sell asubah.

32:06.989 --> 32:12.009
These are coming by some dead person using
this bhanawati; they are bringing this down

32:12.009 --> 32:13.009
here.

32:13.009 --> 32:18.210
But there where he told Me thousands of people
wanting just to touch the feet of these bhootas.

32:18.210 --> 32:24.730
They thought such a bhoot cannot bring these
deities and that must be God who is coming

32:24.730 --> 32:26.010
in the form.

32:26.010 --> 32:31.899
If in the thing was written also, made in
near Mumbadevi and this and that.

32:31.899 --> 32:38.509
You mean God is sitting there and making those
statues?

32:38.509 --> 32:43.249
We don’t use our brains also, when it comes
to God.

32:43.249 --> 32:48.539
I mean faith is necessary no doubt, but this
is after realization, before realization it’s

32:48.539 --> 32:51.359
a blind faith, which can be any nonsense.

32:51.359 --> 32:55.820
I have seen such mad people that they just
go on pulling out their hair and they say

32:55.820 --> 32:58.109
that we are doing it in the name of God, really?

32:58.109 --> 33:00.580
Why did God give you these hairs?

33:00.580 --> 33:04.179
If he wanted you to pull it out like that
morning till evening sitting and pulling it

33:04.179 --> 33:09.590
out and they develop such nervousness that
if they are not properly aware they will start

33:09.590 --> 33:12.659
pulling out from your hair also.

33:12.659 --> 33:19.090
It is such a dangerous situation in this blind
faith, that you form some habits.

33:19.090 --> 33:25.979
You know people have an idea of using the
mala, that’s why Kabira has said “kar

33:25.979 --> 33:31.469
kamana ka chade de manna ka manna ka pher”
So they will also say, they will have it “kar

33:31.469 --> 33:33.909
kamana man ka chade de manna ka manna ka pher”
finished.

33:33.909 --> 33:41.470
Even the children have understood the joke,
this is what we are doing, that when it is

33:41.470 --> 33:48.159
told that you have to have God in your heart
and don’t do these rituals, you will find

33:48.159 --> 33:54.159
these people using that rosary to such an
extent, that if they are talking they don’t

33:54.159 --> 33:58.940
have that, they cannot sit tight, it’s like
a nervousness in them, it’s a nervousness

33:58.940 --> 34:04.500
by which they must go on (aur main to hamesha
mala jappti houn 108 and falaana) and you

34:04.500 --> 34:12.379
feel that the person is about to land up in
some lunatic asylum with the number 108.

34:12.379 --> 34:19.179
The way people are mad in religion makes people
really atheist they see these mad people what

34:19.179 --> 34:21.030
are they doing is the religion?

34:21.030 --> 34:25.149
Is this the religion, where people sell it,
you go to any temple?

34:25.149 --> 34:33.660
Once we had bought some Am rood, Guavas and
we went to the temple we were thinking that

34:33.660 --> 34:38.889
we will get out of, then we were very young,
[not clear_], and we were lots of brothers

34:38.889 --> 34:45.860
and sisters we went down to a temple and we
thought that after seeing the temple we will

34:45.860 --> 34:50.550
go outside behind the temple and we will eat
the thing as soon as we reached there, the

34:50.550 --> 34:54.609
Pujari took out the packets from our hands,
you know, all the children poor things were

34:54.609 --> 34:57.490
carrying three, four packets we had and they
took out everything from [not clear_], we

34:57.490 --> 35:04.200
were looking at them why did they took out
everything and gave us one each you see, wah

35:04.200 --> 35:10.299
wah !! and we were about to cry, but my younger
sister couldn’t bare it, she said “why

35:10.299 --> 35:12.410
did you take away my, all my Guavas?

35:12.410 --> 35:17.150
please return it to me”, but this is sort
of a right they have got to live on your money,

35:17.150 --> 35:18.150
these parasites.

35:18.150 --> 35:23.980
In the name of God these parasites, you are
the people who are nurturing them, you just

35:23.980 --> 35:29.400
giving them money, it is better to give to
a beggar, then to give to these horrible sophisticated

35:29.400 --> 35:34.060
beggars sitting on the temples and churches.

35:34.060 --> 35:39.890
You are the people who are responsible for
creating such a mess because half of the people

35:39.890 --> 35:46.609
are indifferent; those who are not indifferent
bhagvaan ke naam pe, half of them are like

35:46.609 --> 35:52.780
that who go to one Sidhhi Vinayak mandir and
Mangalwaar day (Tuesday), you will find that

35:52.780 --> 35:55.665
queue of sometimes two miles in that Bombay,
where people have no time for anything.

35:55.665 --> 36:02.849
People are moving with the pace of an Ant,
one inch in one hour, there are some people

36:02.849 --> 36:07.730
who start in the night and they move on, they
go with their naariyal and the naariyals,

36:07.730 --> 36:10.080
come from the other side and sold again next
month.

36:10.080 --> 36:17.180
They know this; still they say we have done
it with bhakti and Ganesha will give us what

36:17.180 --> 36:18.180
we like.

36:18.180 --> 36:23.279
Ganesha will only give you wisdom, I wish
he could, I wish he could give you wisdom

36:23.279 --> 36:24.420
and understanding about religion.

36:24.420 --> 36:31.630
This is a mess we have done out of our religion,
every religion, every religion is not only

36:31.630 --> 36:35.400
Hinduism, Islam or Christianity or Sikhism.

36:35.400 --> 36:39.920
We have really killed the religion by our
indifference, or by too much of indulgence,

36:39.920 --> 36:42.779
blind fold, faith in all these horrible people,
who claim that they are religious people,

36:42.779 --> 36:44.880
by what means are they?

36:44.880 --> 36:46.970
Go and see their lifestyle.

36:46.970 --> 36:51.680
Go and see what sort of a people they are.

36:51.680 --> 36:56.410
They are raksasha’s some of them I can tell
you, when I went to Vrindavan I felt all the

36:56.410 --> 36:59.500
anucharaas of Kansa are their fundas.

36:59.500 --> 37:06.070
All of them not one I found as a human being,
they are such horrible people and the way

37:06.070 --> 37:10.319
they torture you still you go about religion.

37:10.319 --> 37:17.859
One has to understand that God stands in His
purity He is a pure being and He likes our

37:17.859 --> 37:18.859
wisdom.

37:18.859 --> 37:22.120
He doesn’t like people who are stupid and
foolish.

37:22.120 --> 37:29.230
He likes wise people, wise people… like,
Prahllad, Prahllad was an eight year old boy,

37:29.230 --> 37:38.690
when his father Hiranyakashyup challenged
him, Shri Vishnu appeared in a pillar, you

37:38.690 --> 37:50.460
know in a Narsimha avatar and he killed his
father and then he asked this little boy of

37:50.460 --> 37:55.890
eight years Prahllad, he said, “my child,
my devotee, what do you want?”

37:55.890 --> 38:05.609
He could have asked for anything, Sakshaat
Vishnu was there, but what does he say, “Tav

38:05.609 --> 38:10.089
charna arvinde pritii” Give me love at your
lotus feet, oh my lord that’s all what I

38:10.089 --> 38:11.089
want.

38:11.089 --> 38:12.329
To love you at your lotus feet.

38:12.329 --> 38:18.510
If you have your pure love for God He will
give you wisdom.

38:18.510 --> 38:25.289
If you do not have your purity you go there
to ask for this thing and that thing; Give

38:25.289 --> 38:32.670
me a transfer, specially government servants,
they are never satisfied, they want to have

38:32.670 --> 38:40.770
transfers all the time, Give me a promotion,
Give me a son, when you get a son, give me

38:40.770 --> 38:42.370
a job for my son.

38:42.370 --> 38:43.980
When he gets a job, get him a wife, poor Ganesha
must be tired.

38:43.980 --> 38:48.930
This is what it is, this is not religion,
this is not God, this has nothing to do with

38:48.930 --> 38:54.810
spirituality, you have to ask for one thing,
“Tav charna arvinde pritii."

38:54.810 --> 39:02.780
Oh lord let me be at your lotus feet so that
one day my Kundalini would be awakened and

39:02.780 --> 39:06.109
that my atma would be enlightened within my
awareness.

39:06.109 --> 39:13.049
Let me keep my life so beautiful, “Ye chaadar
rishi muni jann odhi, Odhi ke meli kini chadariya,Daas

39:13.049 --> 39:16.910
Kabir jatan se odhi, Jaisi ki taisi rakh dini
chadariya."

39:16.910 --> 39:28.779
This is what we should have done, instead
of that we go to this Tan trick, that bhajji,

39:28.779 --> 39:36.391
that Pundit ji, that Pandey ji, or some other
Paadri ji or what you call them other sorts

39:36.391 --> 39:41.339
of people those Mullah ji’s and all sorts
of Mau Lana ji’s and Pir’s and all sorts

39:41.339 --> 39:43.569
of things and what do you get?

39:43.569 --> 39:44.920
A bad Agnya.

39:44.920 --> 39:51.150
They have no right to be there, they are there
because they want to make a business out of

39:51.150 --> 39:52.150
God.

39:52.150 --> 39:58.000
Today I spoke about it, because it is important
to understand, what is religion?

39:58.000 --> 40:07.359
In India especially I have seen people go
out of the way to do penances in the name

40:07.359 --> 40:16.320
of God, which is a great thing, but why do
you do penance, what is there to suffer?

40:16.320 --> 40:21.630
Why do you make your body suffer so much?

40:21.630 --> 40:30.190
Keep your body alright, don’t overdo things,
keep a moderate life, lead a normal life,

40:30.190 --> 40:34.329
that’s what Buddha has told you, there is
no need to go to extremes for anything, but

40:34.329 --> 40:41.940
even Buddhist, they have gone to another extreme
so he had to come on this Earth as Shankaracharaya

40:41.940 --> 40:43.359
to tell people what are you doing?

40:43.359 --> 40:44.380
When did I say this?

40:44.380 --> 40:45.859
Then they were born as the son of Fatimabai
[editor’s note to verifier: John Noyce has

40:45.859 --> 40:52.050
verified that this is the correct spelling]
who was herself nothing else but Janaki and

40:52.050 --> 40:58.910
they were her sons Hassan and Hussein, who
had preached non-violence and they saw that

40:58.910 --> 41:03.539
people were trying to save bugs and mosquitoes.

41:03.539 --> 41:09.300
You know there are some funny cults where
we are so particular of bugs mosquitoes and

41:09.300 --> 41:15.480
all the worms, we are not at all particular
about human beings, they, I don’t know what

41:15.480 --> 41:16.500
am I going to do with bugs?

41:16.500 --> 41:17.500
Am I going to give them realization?

41:17.500 --> 41:18.769
Even chicken’s… am I going to give them
realization?

41:18.769 --> 41:21.900
I have to give realization to human beings.

41:21.900 --> 41:28.539
What is the need to pay so much attention
to these nonsensical things?

41:28.539 --> 41:34.670
To save the bugs and save the mosquitoes and
make them bite the Brahmin and pay them money,

41:34.670 --> 41:38.359
because they think they have done a great
kalyana on the bugs.

41:38.359 --> 41:45.380
Perhaps they might have been bugs, in last
lives, the way they are interested in all

41:45.380 --> 41:46.720
these mosquitoes.

41:46.720 --> 41:54.260
Now, these two were born as Hassan and Hussein
and to get rid of these ideas of non-violence

41:54.260 --> 42:03.490
they had this Karbala, in which they fought
and died like great shuras (great warriors).

42:03.490 --> 42:06.630
This is a story of great incarnations on this
Earth.

42:06.630 --> 42:14.470
There are so many of them who were born, I
have no time to tell you, but Socrates was

42:14.470 --> 42:17.640
the same, his disciple was one of these two.

42:17.640 --> 42:26.369
Abraham, Moses, who are propagating Jews their
religion, [not clear] people are another mad,

42:26.369 --> 42:32.380
another mad people I can tell you, these Jews,
God save them from their madness, they will

42:32.380 --> 42:38.480
make a sum that their books are, say called
as, todhat [not clear], they make it microscopic,

42:38.480 --> 42:46.031
the more microscopic it is, the more spiritual
you are and they tie it up here you see, you

42:46.031 --> 42:49.930
can’t even read it, you have to use a nice
magnifying glass to read that, they never

42:49.930 --> 42:51.069
read, its tied up here.

42:51.069 --> 42:56.390
According to them, if it is studded with diamonds,
then you are a greater spiritual person, they

42:56.390 --> 43:04.480
are very rich people you see, so they tie
it up there and before a wailing wall they

43:04.480 --> 43:11.710
go and like mad they are beating their heads
there and weeping for what they have done.

43:11.710 --> 43:15.470
I mean there is no end to the madness of people.

43:15.470 --> 43:19.660
You can understand that this is not religion.

43:19.660 --> 43:24.750
Now the other day there was one Arya samaji
fellow who came to Me, he could not get his

43:24.750 --> 43:30.200
realization; I must tell you these are another
fanatic types we have, Arya samaji, have they

43:30.200 --> 43:33.240
been able to get to their spirit?

43:33.240 --> 43:38.690
They are only bothered about re-converting
the people, marrying the people or building

43:38.690 --> 43:42.730
the buildings and saying that, no we don’t
believe in God, we don’t believe in this

43:42.730 --> 43:43.730
kind of a God.

43:43.730 --> 43:44.730
We don’t believe in.

43:44.730 --> 43:47.200
Who cares whether you believe or not, who
are you?

43:47.200 --> 43:49.050
What right have you got to say anything?

43:49.050 --> 43:52.470
It’s like any monkey standing up and saying,
“I don’t believe in this government, I

43:52.470 --> 43:53.910
don’t believe in that government”.

43:53.910 --> 43:57.440
Who is bothered about these people who talk
like this.

43:57.440 --> 43:59.329
Who are they?

43:59.329 --> 44:02.400
What authority have they got to say what is
good and what is bad.

44:02.400 --> 44:05.610
Do they know what is good and what is bad?

44:05.610 --> 44:11.240
To say like these things about, we don’t
believe in this and we don’t believe in

44:11.240 --> 44:12.240
that.

44:12.240 --> 44:18.829
For us it is essential to know that, first
let us know ourselves, let us get our light

44:18.829 --> 44:27.089
enlightened and in that light let us see the
truth as it is you cannot ask the truth to

44:27.089 --> 44:29.049
be like this.

44:29.049 --> 44:30.049
You cannot organize God.

44:30.049 --> 44:33.950
He is what He is, He remain as He is, you
cannot transform Him.

44:33.950 --> 44:38.059
Only thing you can do is become one with Him.

44:38.059 --> 44:44.650
What you can do is to perceive Him, to feel
Him, to be, that is the thing you can be,

44:44.650 --> 44:49.839
but you cannot make God as you like Him, He
is what He is as I have told you.

44:49.839 --> 44:55.270
and the best thing will be that you be humble
like Prahllad, to say, “Tav charna arvinde

44:55.270 --> 44:59.609
pritii” Who are we to criticize these incarnations
of Primordial master?

44:59.609 --> 45:01.519
What have we done?

45:01.519 --> 45:06.710
Like, once somebody started criticizing Me,
so one of my disciples, Bardarf [not clear]

45:06.710 --> 45:11.760
called him, come here, come here, how many
people have you given realization to?

45:11.760 --> 45:15.750
He said “none”, He said, How many people
have you cured?

45:15.750 --> 45:16.819
What good have you done to people?

45:16.819 --> 45:18.200
He said none, what do you do?

45:18.200 --> 45:22.690
He said I am a barber, he said you better
become a barber.

45:22.690 --> 45:24.210
What are you talking here?

45:24.210 --> 45:25.309
What right have you got?

45:25.309 --> 45:26.309
What is your position to talk?

45:26.309 --> 45:28.410
But in this kalyuga, even a person who does
not even know a word about religion, about

45:28.410 --> 45:33.250
God, who is not awakened, who is not realized,
then talk about God.

45:33.250 --> 45:35.430
This is ghour kalyuga, they are not afraid,
they are not afraid, to make money in the

45:35.430 --> 45:45.559
name of God is the greatest sin, is the greatest
sin, I tell you, to make money like that in

45:45.559 --> 45:53.410
the name of God and to spoil somebody’s
Kundalini, as these, all these fake Guru’s

45:53.410 --> 45:54.410
are doing.

45:54.410 --> 45:58.549
Using there bhoot vidya, they do not know
they will go to hell permanently; absolutely

45:58.549 --> 46:03.779
permanently they will be there and there will
be no return from there.

46:03.779 --> 46:09.279
They have been given many chances before,
but no more chances for them.

46:09.279 --> 46:16.029
We are the people who have to correct them,
we have to stand together and tell them, nothing

46:16.029 --> 46:22.369
doing, we had some people in Bombay who are
Brahmins, who are Brahmins, who are Brahmins

46:22.369 --> 46:26.130
of the high order as we can call, [not clear]
they are called as and they got their realization.

46:26.130 --> 46:31.720
Now they had to be taken up upon yourself
to put down all these horrible fake people

46:31.720 --> 46:36.170
who are making money out of the public.

46:36.170 --> 46:39.869
So one of them is a teacher and he told a
Brahmin in his family, because he was permanently

46:39.869 --> 46:42.530
stuck, you see us Brahmins stuck to the families.

46:42.530 --> 46:50.680
He said that, “my”, “I have to do the
Shard of my father, when can you come, within

46:50.680 --> 46:51.680
the Pitrupaksh?

46:51.680 --> 46:54.760
He said I can only come on Wednesday or something
like that.

46:54.760 --> 46:57.690
He said are you sure that there is a Muhrata
for that?

46:57.690 --> 46:59.849
Yes, he said, yes very I am sure of it.

46:59.849 --> 47:04.500
So he went to another fellow, got the Panchanga,
Maharashtrians, that way know a lot about

47:04.500 --> 47:08.380
these things like Panchanga and all that and
he opened the Panchanga he studied there and

47:08.380 --> 47:10.650
he found out that there was no muhrata, in
any Panchanga whatsoever.

47:10.650 --> 47:15.380
There are three Panchangas which we use, I
don’t know if we know here about it, he

47:15.380 --> 47:20.130
saw all of them, then accordingly the muhrata
was on Tuesday, he celebrated it.

47:20.130 --> 47:26.960
Then the fellow came, “rehne dijiye, rehne
dijiye, baad mein le lenge rehne do”.

47:26.960 --> 47:33.230
Then the fellow came and he said that “I
have come now come along let us have the shard”,

47:33.230 --> 47:36.119
He said that “I will not even give you a
cup of tea to you today” He said how?

47:36.119 --> 47:40.840
You call me for the Shard I am suppose to
eat at your place, he says no, we have not

47:40.840 --> 47:44.569
cooked anything and I am not going to give
you a cup of tea, if there is no muhrata today,

47:44.569 --> 47:48.140
he said according to Tilak Panchanga it is,
he said I have studied also Tilak Panchanga,

47:48.140 --> 47:49.390
I have studied all this, you get out of here.

47:49.390 --> 47:54.069
The mother was poor thing you know, she said
“how you can this, he is our old thing”,

47:54.069 --> 47:56.819
he said “this is the only chance I have
to get rid of this old fool” and he just

47:56.819 --> 48:03.510
told him, get out you will not stay in this
house and I am not going to give a cup of

48:03.510 --> 48:04.510
tea.

48:04.510 --> 48:13.460
Then in Panduranga’s temple, in…, Panduranga’s
temple is there you know about Vitthhalla’s

48:13.460 --> 48:24.150
in Panderpur [not clear] we have people going
down there and when I saw these people I was

48:24.150 --> 48:27.950
surprised, they were all crazy people for
a month poor things are singing songs eat

48:27.950 --> 48:31.319
little take that nasha of tambacco and go
singing songs for months together they go

48:31.319 --> 48:36.230
to see Panduranga there and these people who
live there are called as Badwe, their names

48:36.230 --> 48:40.460
are absolutely suited you see, like in Kolapur
they are called as Bhootis, can you imagine?

48:40.460 --> 48:44.349
The Brahmins are called as Bhootis and these
are called as Badwe’s.

48:44.349 --> 48:49.930
and these people ask them, “How is it, you
have got cracks in your heads?” he said

48:49.930 --> 48:54.670
that this Naral, this naariyal or you can
call the coconut was broken at the lotus feet

48:54.670 --> 48:56.480
of Panduranga, I said, how?

48:56.480 --> 49:02.500
I couldn’t understand, these Badwe’s were
doing this job and when I said that these

49:02.500 --> 49:08.079
Badwe’s should know if they don’t behave,
they are going to have a very bad time, you

49:08.079 --> 49:10.890
see everybody was shocked but you’ll be
amazed within eight days the government took

49:10.890 --> 49:13.500
over that place and its working out, but now
their language has changed, but this is how

49:13.500 --> 49:15.880
these people have been troubling us, but now
we have got four Brahmins, four Brahmins living

49:15.880 --> 49:20.369
in Panderpur who are after their throat and
they go to the temple and tell people that

49:20.369 --> 49:25.529
don’t listen to the [unclear] and they are
propagating and they said that if you want

49:25.529 --> 49:32.089
anything you ask us, but don’t give a single
Pai to these Badwa’s, good for nothing,

49:32.089 --> 49:37.089
useless, whatever you want to do, you do it
to the deity and don’t touch these people,

49:37.089 --> 49:40.880
treat them as untouchables and these are the
people who have started it.

49:40.880 --> 49:42.859
It is we who can change the people.

49:42.859 --> 49:47.890
Once we get realization, the transformation
starts taking place within us.

49:47.890 --> 49:52.640
When the transformation takes place a person
becomes fearless.

49:52.640 --> 49:58.130
He is not tempted easily by things, for example
I have known people, who use to take a lot

49:58.130 --> 50:03.779
of bribes, have given up taking up bribe,
because their financial condition also improves,

50:03.779 --> 50:08.470
their Lakshmi tatwa is awakened and they do
not take any bribes, their Dharma is jaagrut,

50:08.470 --> 50:13.279
they do not drink, many people who were drunkards
have given up drinking, because the Dharma

50:13.279 --> 50:14.279
is awakened within us, you just can’t bare
it.

50:14.279 --> 50:16.369
Just like a human being cannot bear dirt but
an animal can.

50:16.369 --> 50:21.160
In the same way, it happens to you, you just
don’t bear it, you don’t want to have

50:21.160 --> 50:22.160
it anymore.

50:22.160 --> 50:26.270
In the same way, your political situation
will improve, because what is the problem

50:26.270 --> 50:28.550
today, what is the problem?

50:28.550 --> 50:33.019
if you have went down to Maharashtra and there
the people said that we have a problem of

50:33.019 --> 50:37.380
sugar, I said why, you produce a lot of sugar,
he said there is one fellow known as Sugar

50:37.380 --> 50:39.180
king, he has hoarded all the Sugar.

50:39.180 --> 50:40.740
I said really, then why don’t you inform
the police about it?

50:40.740 --> 50:44.540
They said, when Janta government was there
he gave them money, now this government is

50:44.540 --> 50:47.730
here, he gives them money, he gives money
to all police officers, he is driving all

50:47.730 --> 50:53.140
of them and he also bribed us and made us
vote for certain people, who are under his

50:53.140 --> 50:54.140
control.

50:54.140 --> 50:56.080
I said, then you are responsible for this.

50:56.080 --> 51:03.430
You get your realization and next time only
vote for or stand with a realized soul .Do

51:03.430 --> 51:09.180
not vote for anyone who is not a realized
soul and you will see this country will change

51:09.180 --> 51:14.280
just like this, the whole situation will change
.It is you who are misusing your votes, in

51:14.280 --> 51:17.049
the villages even for one time need they give
votes.

51:17.049 --> 51:19.259
How are you going to improve your people?

51:19.259 --> 51:23.460
How this deterioration is going to stop by
only, by your parivartan, by your transformation,

51:23.460 --> 51:25.270
that’s only possible through Kundalini awakening.

51:25.270 --> 51:29.200
When the Kundalini awakening takes place the
man knows his esteem, he stands up like a

51:29.200 --> 51:38.270
human being and he doesn’t behave like a
dog, who runs after every position you get,

51:38.270 --> 51:42.920
every money you get, “give me, give me”.

51:42.920 --> 51:45.250
It’s not like that.

51:45.250 --> 51:50.480
He stands in his dignity and in his [not clear
] and nobody can put him down.

51:50.480 --> 51:58.750
This is what it is; the Sahaja Yoga is such
a blessing, for all of us, in all the world,

51:58.750 --> 52:02.240
wherever there is a chaos, it is everywhere
now and so many angles it is going to it,

52:02.240 --> 52:08.240
for Samaj Karya also, now in Samaj specially
in the north, you see the condition is very

52:08.240 --> 52:11.930
bad, the woman are treated very shabbily,
they say it’s the influence of the Muslim

52:11.930 --> 52:13.580
religion and whatever it is.

52:13.580 --> 52:21.559
But if you go to Turkey, you will be surprised
that the people treat woman with such respect

52:21.559 --> 52:22.559
and such understanding.

52:22.559 --> 52:26.770
In our own scriptures it is written that:
“Yatra naryastu pujyante ramante tatra Devata”[Manu

52:26.770 --> 52:32.640
smriti 3-56] Means, where the woman is respected,
there resides the Gods, but the woman has

52:32.640 --> 52:36.510
to be respectable also, if she is not a respectable,
no use respecting her.

52:36.510 --> 52:41.900
It is both ways, but the way we treat our
woman, in the villages, specially in the North,

52:41.900 --> 52:48.210
like Bihar, U.P, Punjab, Punjab is now better,
woman have taken over quite a lot.

52:48.210 --> 52:52.960
But that should not be the case, woman should
remain woman but men must respect them.

52:52.960 --> 52:57.950
What I mean, that woman must be respected
as they are and men must be respected as they

52:57.950 --> 52:58.950
are.

52:58.950 --> 53:03.130
They don’t have to change their places but
in these places, all Bengal all of them you

53:03.130 --> 53:04.130
now how [unclear].

53:04.130 --> 53:06.970
Women commit suicides in that country because
they cannot get married and they are put down.

53:06.970 --> 53:09.509
If you cannot get married what does it matter?

53:09.509 --> 53:12.509
You have to give dowry, if you don’t give
dowry you cannot get married.

53:12.509 --> 53:16.940
All kinds of problems a husband will come
drunkard, he will beat his wife because he

53:16.940 --> 53:20.540
is fallen in love with another woman, he is
going to some other person .The wife has to

53:20.540 --> 53:23.329
come as out and she becomes a woman who has
no husband, everybody ill treats the woman.

53:23.329 --> 53:26.119
All sorts of things are here, why?

53:26.119 --> 53:28.200
Because we do not understand that woman is
the Shakti.

53:28.200 --> 53:32.730
In her lies the Shakti we have to respect
the women.

53:32.730 --> 53:37.990
When the women are not respected that country
goes to dogs and the women must know that

53:37.990 --> 53:45.560
they are Shakti and they are to be respectable
and not to be frivolous and cheap the way

53:45.560 --> 53:48.000
Indian women are now taking to western life
I am really shocked that means that our tradition

53:48.000 --> 53:49.150
has no depth in it.

53:49.150 --> 53:53.579
That the way we have accepted all these nonsensical
values of the West, where the West has gone

53:53.579 --> 53:59.170
to dogs and we are going to dogs for this
I will hold the woman responsible who behave

53:59.170 --> 54:05.319
so cheaply on the streets and in the offices
and in the houses.

54:05.319 --> 54:09.839
It is the women who have to keep the Dharma
going.

54:09.839 --> 54:10.839
Now with this.

54:10.839 --> 54:13.619
It is very remarkable, what is happening,
if the mother of the house is not respected,

54:13.619 --> 54:18.500
is treated like a servant, she has no place
in the family, husband comes from the office

54:18.500 --> 54:23.940
and shouts at her, children cannot respect
her, they cannot be disciplined, if the mother

54:23.940 --> 54:25.289
is not respected.

54:25.289 --> 54:30.560
Your children can never be disciplined.

54:30.560 --> 54:33.569
You see now, you talk of indiscipline, indiscipline
everywhere.

54:33.569 --> 54:40.690
I remember, when I was young, we could not
do even a thing without asking our mother.

54:40.690 --> 54:47.059
If we had our father we wanted to, he’d
say, “Did you ask your mother?

54:47.059 --> 54:51.773
Go and ask your mother” In the family, in
the house she was the Grahalakshmi, she was

54:51.773 --> 54:56.390
given all the keys all the money, not a single
pie was spent without asking her.

54:56.390 --> 55:01.430
But these days, the woman have become so either
very miserly or so extra wagon that men do

55:01.430 --> 55:03.890
not know what to do with them.

55:03.890 --> 55:11.539
It was both ways, women have to be wise, they
are the axis the Dhuri of the society, that’s

55:11.539 --> 55:17.650
only possible when they are realized, suddenly
I find very rebellious woman become so, so

55:17.650 --> 55:24.720
beautiful, so beautiful and so women like,
so sweet, their, their tongue, their whole

55:24.720 --> 55:30.349
behavior everything changes so beautifully,
it’s surprising, even western women I have

55:30.349 --> 55:33.500
seen, who walk like horses normally.

55:33.500 --> 55:39.570
If you see them they really walk like horses,
but they change their dresses and their whole

55:39.570 --> 55:44.490
thing they become so feminine, so sweet, in
their talks and everything, then what will

55:44.490 --> 55:46.200
happen to Indian women?

55:46.200 --> 55:51.289
But men must know they have to respect women,
if they try to dominate their women, they

55:51.289 --> 55:55.799
will become the same as the western woman
and you will not know what to do with yourself.

55:55.799 --> 56:01.500
If the woman decides to be bad, there’s
no end to miseries that should not be done.

56:01.500 --> 56:06.289
So, please make it a short circuit and let
us understand that for Sahaja yogi it is important

56:06.289 --> 56:07.450
to respect the wife.

56:07.450 --> 56:15.019
So, that there is discipline, still I must
give all my respect to the Indian women, despite

56:15.019 --> 56:19.160
all these things, despite the, all the men
have changed their dresses, all the men have

56:19.160 --> 56:24.579
become English, Indian women have still kept
their dresses and their discipline.

56:24.579 --> 56:29.240
Our men still think, they are great English
people, but our Indian women are not willing

56:29.240 --> 56:30.240
to accept that situation.

56:30.240 --> 56:35.910
I am not saying that there is something wrong
with English, but if we are Indians we should

56:35.910 --> 56:38.930
be Indians, if they are English they should
be English and in the same way with our life,

56:38.930 --> 56:43.260
when there is realization, a woman becomes
a complete woman and a man becomes a complete

56:43.260 --> 56:51.579
man and a complete man we have before us is
Shri Rama, how he loved his wife, in separation

56:51.579 --> 56:57.839
and in meeting, how he loved and how they
despite all their love, how they suffered.

56:57.839 --> 57:02.820
We have before us Shri Rama where he respected
his wife.

57:02.820 --> 57:06.730
It is a Seashell for men to understand that
you are Indians and you have to behave like

57:06.730 --> 57:07.730
them.

57:07.730 --> 57:09.420
You do not know the greatness of our Indian
women.

57:09.420 --> 57:15.539
If you do not treat them well I can assure
you a day will come only very cheap and nasty

57:15.539 --> 57:19.569
and what you call demonic women will be born
here and you will be able to enter even your

57:19.569 --> 57:20.569
homes.

57:20.569 --> 57:23.039
You will be standing outside on your streets.

57:23.039 --> 57:29.510
So be careful about it and also you has brought
us before , the way you treat your wife the

57:29.510 --> 57:34.490
same way your daughters will be treated even
worse, then you will know what you did, so

57:34.490 --> 57:38.349
be kind to her because she has married to
you she is not your slave.

57:38.349 --> 57:39.820
Its is very important.

57:39.820 --> 57:44.340
In northern India more because they think
that southern India, Maharashtra and southern

57:44.340 --> 57:51.250
India women, men are henpecked unless and
until they beat their wives they are henpecked

57:51.250 --> 57:52.990
according to them.

57:52.990 --> 58:01.499
These ideas must be given up but this is only
possible when you get your realization real

58:01.499 --> 58:08.869
joy of leading a very happy married life extremely
beautiful married life of mutual love and

58:08.869 --> 58:13.190
mutual understanding develops I have seen
this happening to so many people the relationship

58:13.190 --> 58:19.210
improving the relationship between parents
and children improving the whole thing becoming

58:19.210 --> 58:25.119
so joyous and so beautiful and the children
becoming so obedient and so sweet, it’s

58:25.119 --> 58:30.380
a beautiful thing so when the atmosphere is
fragrant with your spirituality the whole

58:30.380 --> 58:37.700
aroma , the whole atmosphere we can say completely
charmed ,absolutely charmed by your peaceful

58:37.700 --> 58:38.700
life.

58:38.700 --> 58:40.690
This is the bliss we have to see .

58:40.690 --> 58:45.440
Today I talked about these things because
void is very important thing for us where

58:45.440 --> 58:51.119
all our social, samajic, political, rajkiya
and also our spiritual problems can be solved.

58:51.119 --> 58:57.609
Apart from that I had told you yesterday about
our physical problems tomorrow I will talk

58:57.609 --> 59:02.630
about other charkas to you I hope you have
understood today’s lecture.

59:02.630 --> 59:09.499
I spoke in a very entertaining manner but
you have to know that all this entertainment

59:09.499 --> 59:15.849
has to go within yourself, you have to take
within your self, it’s not meant for others

59:15.849 --> 59:19.980
as soon as you say it is for other, the women
will look at the husbands and the husbands

59:19.980 --> 59:21.369
will look at the wives.

59:21.369 --> 59:23.910
They do not know it is meant for you and not
for others.

59:23.910 --> 59:30.549
All of you should take it up, that am I doing
this, am I doing this, try to correct yourself,

59:30.549 --> 59:36.220
you have to be decent husbands and decent
wives and I would like to see very happy married

59:36.220 --> 59:40.529
couples amongst Sahaja Yogis, when this will
happen then the great souls will take birth

59:40.529 --> 59:41.530
on this earth, you will see great people will
be born.

59:41.530 --> 59:45.839
Already so many Sahaja Yogis have given birth
to very, very great souls.

59:45.839 --> 59:53.990
You will be amazed they know Kundalini from
their very childhood this will happen I am

59:53.990 --> 59:59.140
sure one day it will come and that all the
souls who want to take birth will be born

59:59.140 --> 01:00:00.770
on this earth, especially in India.

01:00:00.770 --> 01:00:06.280
Already lots of great souls I have seen also
in England, let me go I see in Australia I

01:00:06.280 --> 01:00:07.690
am sure it’s happening everywhere.

01:00:07.690 --> 01:00:13.240
But if you are realized souls you really become
perfect parents and you really invite great

01:00:13.240 --> 01:00:15.770
souls on this earth to work it out.
