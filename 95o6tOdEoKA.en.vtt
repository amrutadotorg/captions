Shri Ganesha Puja Berlin, Germany July 21, 1993

00:00:05.499 --> 00:00:11.023
Today, we are going to worship Shri Ganesha.

00:00:12.396 --> 00:00:19.382
As you know in the whole of Europe, America, England

00:00:20.841 --> 00:00:26.618
they have lost faith in Shri Ganesha.

00:00:26.927 --> 00:00:34.430
Nor do they care for His powers and for His blessings.

00:00:35.429 --> 00:00:46.441
As a result all His blessings are not on these countries.

00:00:47.189 --> 00:00:51.544
The first blessing of Shri Ganesha

00:00:51.672 --> 00:00:56.675
which is, I think is the highest is the wisdom

00:00:56.796 --> 00:01:05.396
that we learn what is good for us and what is bad for us;

00:01:05.738 --> 00:01:09.795
what is constructive and what is destructive;

00:01:09.916 --> 00:01:17.506
what should we do to achieve our Self-Realization.

00:01:20.093 --> 00:01:28.498
Those people who have got wisdom are very lucky people.

00:01:28.618 --> 00:01:40.008
But wisdom comes from no source but your own understanding of life.

00:01:40.128 --> 00:01:48.664
When a person starts thinking, “Why am I doing such and such thing?

00:01:49.498 --> 00:01:54.558
What is the effect of my doing?

00:01:54.678 --> 00:02:00.008
What is the result of my behavior?

00:02:00.128 --> 00:02:09.655
Is it good for me or bad for me?” then wisdom comes.

00:02:09.775 --> 00:02:14.295
Even if some people know that this is bad for them,

00:02:14.416 --> 00:02:19.219
still they do not have power to control themselves.

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:23.938
Still they do lots of bad things which they should not do.

00:02:24.073 --> 00:02:28.945
The reason is the power of wisdom is not there.

00:02:29.303 --> 00:02:36.771
A person is wise who does not only know what is right and wrong

00:02:36.892 --> 00:02:44.510
but also he knows very well his own power not to do something wrong.

00:02:44.647 --> 00:02:46.798
He just does not do it.

00:02:46.919 --> 00:02:54.686
Wisdom is a complete power within ourselves by which we try nothing,

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:58.905
it just spontaneously works through us

00:02:59.033 --> 00:03:04.663
and we do things which are proper and right.

00:03:07.797 --> 00:03:15.073
In this wisdom many people have risen very high in life.

00:03:15.978 --> 00:03:21.672
For example, we’ll take the example of Kabir.

00:03:21.792 --> 00:03:28.436
Kabir was born to a weaver.

00:03:28.556 --> 00:03:31.087
They say they don’t think he was born to him

00:03:31.208 --> 00:03:34.521
but he was found by a weaver, whatever it is.

00:03:36.073 --> 00:03:41.636
And he belonged to Muslim family.

00:03:43.066 --> 00:03:47.741
But he realized that the Muslims

00:03:47.861 --> 00:03:55.600
as they are practicing their Islam is not going to give him what he wants.

00:03:56.986 --> 00:04:02.218
He has to seek his self, he has to know himself.

00:04:02.416 --> 00:04:10.183
So what did he do, is to go on the bank of river Ganges in Benares

00:04:10.304 --> 00:04:15.006
and he stayed there waiting for a great Realized soul

00:04:15.127 --> 00:04:18.356
called as Ramananda, Swami Ramananda.

00:04:18.477 --> 00:04:22.844
When this Swami Ramananda came back after his bath,

00:04:22.965 --> 00:04:25.958
immediately he caught hold of his feet.

00:04:26.078 --> 00:04:30.407
After bath if somebody catches the feet of any Brahmin,

00:04:30.528 --> 00:04:32.218
he would shout at him.

00:04:32.338 --> 00:04:35.825
But he was a saint, he was not a Brahmin.

00:04:35.945 --> 00:04:39.098
He said, “My son what do you want?”

00:04:39.218 --> 00:04:43.848
He said, “Sir, give me initiation.

00:04:43.968 --> 00:04:46.615
I want Self-Realization.”

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:52.030
And Swami Ramananda immediately agreed.

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.053
All the other people said, “Sir, he is a Muslim,

00:04:56.173 --> 00:04:59.961
he is an orphan, brought up in a Muslim family.

00:05:00.081 --> 00:05:02.615
How can you give Realization?

00:05:02.735 --> 00:05:07.174
He’ll not accept any of the principles

00:05:07.294 --> 00:05:11.631
which look like coming from Hindu religion.”

00:05:12.996 --> 00:05:18.681
Ramananda looked at Kabir; he could see a great seeker there.

00:05:19.213 --> 00:05:22.016
He said, “You don’t know him, I know him.”

00:05:22.136 --> 00:05:29.348
And he took him with him and Kabira became a great saint after that.

00:05:30.277 --> 00:05:34.412
He’s accepted by Hindus and Muslims

00:05:35.134 --> 00:05:39.613
because he had that power of wisdom,

00:05:39.733 --> 00:05:47.339
he went to a man who was not belonging to his religion,

00:05:47.609 --> 00:05:49.934
who may not have accepted him,

00:05:50.056 --> 00:05:55.119
who might have just thrown him in the river, also possibly.

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:58.185
But he knew also through his wisdom

00:05:58.328 --> 00:06:02.313
that, “This man is the one who will love me,

00:06:02.434 --> 00:06:05.914
because I am a seeker of Truth.”

00:06:06.034 --> 00:06:09.254
So this power of truth works

00:06:09.375 --> 00:06:11.936
in not only that you know what is right and wrong,

00:06:12.057 --> 00:06:18.151
again I say, but that you just don’t do something that is wrong.

00:06:18.426 --> 00:06:22.988
Now one may say, “Mother what is the source again, of this wisdom?”

00:06:23.108 --> 00:06:26.953
The source is Shri Ganesha.

00:06:28.373 --> 00:06:35.563
The source is Shri Ganesha, which is the Giver of wisdom.

00:06:37.158 --> 00:06:41.288
Once Shri Ganesha is insulted

00:06:41.409 --> 00:06:49.639
and He disappears behind the clouds of ignorance,

00:06:49.759 --> 00:06:54.353
then people start doing things which are unwise.

00:06:54.774 --> 00:06:57.593
This happens with many things.

00:06:57.713 --> 00:07:03.066
Supposing these days in the democratic countries,

00:07:03.186 --> 00:07:08.554
they are not supposed to say anything about the morality,

00:07:08.674 --> 00:07:13.631
about how people should behave, what should be their relationships.

00:07:13.751 --> 00:07:16.332
They don’t try to look after the society

00:07:16.453 --> 00:07:19.592
because they think looking after the society is not our job,

00:07:19.713 --> 00:07:23.137
it’s a private affair, it’s a private thing.

00:07:23.257 --> 00:07:27.451
As a result, people take freedom into their hands

00:07:27.572 --> 00:07:31.096
and start insulting Shri Ganesha.

00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:37.770
When Shri Ganesha is insulted,

00:07:38.867 --> 00:07:43.926
complete blockage takes place in a human being, I think.

00:07:44.047 --> 00:07:45.935
He becomes an idiot.

00:07:46.056 --> 00:07:48.337
He becomes a stupid fellow.

00:07:48.457 --> 00:07:57.286
He doesn’t understand how to go further with wisdom.

00:07:58.587 --> 00:08:05.334
Without wisdom whatever steps one takes is destructive.

00:08:05.468 --> 00:08:10.378
So this is the first quality of Shri Ganesha

00:08:10.498 --> 00:08:15.642
that He gives us, bestows upon us wisdom.

00:08:16.351 --> 00:08:21.270
So we have to respect Shri Ganesha within us,

00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:26.059
is very important specially for all these democratic countries

00:08:26.179 --> 00:08:30.287
which are now going to dogs, their families are destroyed

00:08:30.408 --> 00:08:33.022
because their lifestyle is so horrible,

00:08:33.142 --> 00:08:40.950
their children are ruined, in every way they are in a big jeopardy.

00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:48.289
This wisdom can be easily brought back if we awaken their Kundalini.

00:08:48.409 --> 00:08:54.714
If the Kundalini is awakened this Ganesha can be awakened,

00:08:54.834 --> 00:08:58.713
because without His help Kundalini cannot be awakened.

00:08:58.833 --> 00:09:05.265
And if Shri Ganesha knows that Kundalini is to be awakened

00:09:05.386 --> 00:09:09.672
He forgives everything, forgets everything

00:09:09.793 --> 00:09:14.479
and comes to assist you, to support the Kundalini’s ascent.

00:09:14.599 --> 00:09:18.014
At every chakra He is there to support you,

00:09:18.134 --> 00:09:23.053
till you get Realization He is there to help you.

00:09:26.233 --> 00:09:31.710
In all these countries the missing point is their wisdom

00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:35.014
and that’s why you find so much of destruction,

00:09:35.134 --> 00:09:37.455
so much of nonsense going on

00:09:37.576 --> 00:09:42.054
and you can’t understand why people are so stupid.

00:09:43.872 --> 00:09:48.753
The another power that Shri Ganesha has

00:09:48.873 --> 00:09:52.541
is He generates innocence within us.

00:09:52.661 --> 00:09:54.488
We respect our innocence.

00:09:54.608 --> 00:09:56.507
We respect our chastity.

00:09:56.627 --> 00:10:03.711
We respect a lifestyle which is decent and decorous.

00:10:03.893 --> 00:10:06.589
In every scripture is written

00:10:06.709 --> 00:10:11.921
that we should dress up in a way that we are decent and decorous

00:10:12.064 --> 00:10:15.208
and that our body should not

00:10:15.328 --> 00:10:28.028
in any way express a indecent feeling or indecent behavior on our part.

00:10:29.938 --> 00:10:32.525
This is the reason why in Sahaja Yoga

00:10:32.646 --> 00:10:36.370
we have to be particular about how we dress up.

00:10:36.868 --> 00:10:39.055
I think Sahaja Yogis have realized it

00:10:39.176 --> 00:10:43.636
that our dress should be decent, should be dignified

00:10:43.757 --> 00:10:53.909
and that we should in no way try to show our vulgarity.

00:10:55.038 --> 00:10:59.458
Because if innocence is the most important thing a human being should have,

00:10:59.579 --> 00:11:06.306
if that is the complete decoration of a human being,

00:11:06.426 --> 00:11:14.677
then one should look after one’s own chastity and one’s own morality.

00:11:15.121 --> 00:11:17.373
In some countries, of course,

00:11:17.494 --> 00:11:20.066
they think that chastity is only meant for women

00:11:20.187 --> 00:11:22.060
and not for men.

00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:23.639
But it's not true.

00:11:23.759 --> 00:11:26.983
That’s what the Islamic people believe. It's very wrong.

00:11:27.103 --> 00:11:29.855
It is meant for both of them.

00:11:29.975 --> 00:11:41.945
Like a person who is trying to force the other side,

00:11:42.066 --> 00:11:46.943
like the men trying to force the women to be chaste

00:11:47.515 --> 00:11:51.677
and themselves are not chaste, the women will not be chaste.

00:11:51.797 --> 00:11:54.995
They may look, appear, they may try to be out of fear,

00:11:55.115 --> 00:12:00.501
but if they get a chance they will take to life which is wrong.

00:12:00.622 --> 00:12:02.504
Because they see the other party,

00:12:02.625 --> 00:12:05.119
the men trying to dominate them,

00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:08.910
then they think, “What’s wrong, if they can do it why not we do it?”

00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:13.749
So the whole society has to take to very decent life

00:12:13.869 --> 00:12:24.028
and to a very, very decorous, dignified lifestyle.

00:12:24.149 --> 00:12:29.996
It's not only in dress but even day-to-day life it is important.

00:12:32.131 --> 00:12:39.451
Otherwise a kind of a insecurity start working among men and women

00:12:39.571 --> 00:12:45.584
and too much complications, too much complicated life starts.

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:52.187
The third quality which I am saying today

00:12:52.308 --> 00:12:55.461
is that a person who is innocent

00:12:55.582 --> 00:13:01.909
should not fear because God looks after innocent people.

00:13:02.029 --> 00:13:04.201
They are always protected.

00:13:04.321 --> 00:13:09.774
If anybody tries to harm the innocent God protects them,

00:13:09.894 --> 00:13:14.846
and that’s how you have seen many children who fall from high stories

00:13:14.966 --> 00:13:18.690
they are saved and so many things happen.

00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:22.650
But also we see many children are being killed

00:13:22.771 --> 00:13:25.989
by people who are extremely aggressive.

00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:31.551
Of course that is very, very cruel and wrong to do,

00:13:31.672 --> 00:13:36.454
to kill the innocent children but when these children are killed,

00:13:36.575 --> 00:13:39.664
actually nobody is killed as you know very well,

00:13:39.784 --> 00:13:42.525
the whole world gets shaken up;

00:13:42.652 --> 00:13:47.650
anything happens to children the whole world gets shaken up

00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:52.393
and then the whole world start protecting the innocent.

00:13:52.513 --> 00:13:56.123
If some people, men are killed or something happens to them

00:13:56.244 --> 00:14:00.172
nobody is so much bothered, but even one child is in difficulty

00:14:00.292 --> 00:14:04.000
all the people combine together to save that child.

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:06.202
It’s so important,

00:14:06.322 --> 00:14:09.412
it's not the child, but the innocence of the child

00:14:09.532 --> 00:14:14.030
that generates that feeling that we have to save

00:14:14.296 --> 00:14:19.730
that innocent, little thing which is having a problem.

00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:23.143
That’s why in the whole history you find

00:14:23.263 --> 00:14:30.600
wherever there have been description of children being killed

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:34.845
or where innocence has been attacked,

00:14:35.083 --> 00:14:40.813
the whole society, historically also, has revolted against it.

00:14:40.978 --> 00:14:44.861
And this revolt comes from Shri Ganesha’s power,

00:14:44.981 --> 00:14:51.880
that He can definitely create a feeling of detest

00:14:52.001 --> 00:14:55.334
for people who try to be unkind to children.

00:14:55.454 --> 00:14:57.351
If you see in the newspaper also

00:14:57.472 --> 00:15:00.574
they will show how the children are suffering.

00:15:00.992 --> 00:15:03.638
What is the problem of the children, what they suffer?

00:15:03.758 --> 00:15:11.524
It’s a very, very touching thing to hurt the children.

00:15:11.644 --> 00:15:17.301
In Sahaja Yoga we have now children who are born-realized

00:15:17.422 --> 00:15:20.243
and we understand their innocence.

00:15:20.363 --> 00:15:23.563
We try to keep them out of bounds

00:15:23.683 --> 00:15:28.045
from all these horrible things that are happening today in the world.

00:15:28.165 --> 00:15:30.135
And we are trying to look after them

00:15:30.255 --> 00:15:35.554
so that they grow up into children who are not only born realized,

00:15:35.675 --> 00:15:43.383
but who will save others from the dilemma of getting themselves ruined

00:15:43.504 --> 00:15:48.073
and by not respecting their innocence.

00:15:48.343 --> 00:15:54.146
This respect of innocence once it’s developed,

00:15:55.043 --> 00:15:59.696
through such happenings, through their own children,

00:15:59.816 --> 00:16:06.441
through their own relationships, then the whole nation can be saved.

00:16:06.584 --> 00:16:09.728
Another way is to worship Shri Ganesha

00:16:09.849 --> 00:16:15.071
which comes from the Mother Earth, the principle of innocence.

00:16:15.270 --> 00:16:19.614
The Mother Earth is so innocent, whether you are good or bad,

00:16:19.803 --> 00:16:24.158
She gives you fruits, She gives you trees, She looks after you.

00:16:24.279 --> 00:16:29.806
Whether you are telling lies

00:16:29.926 --> 00:16:33.573
or you are deceiving people, still She does it.

00:16:33.693 --> 00:16:35.774
Of course up to a point

00:16:35.895 --> 00:16:41.563
and after that She may bring forth some sort of a calamity

00:16:41.685 --> 00:16:44.888
like an earthquake, or something like that.

00:16:45.008 --> 00:16:48.929
Now the earthquake mostly suspected always

00:16:49.057 --> 00:16:52.664
in the Los Angeles area, very much.

00:16:52.806 --> 00:16:58.307
And they have practically every year there is a shake-up there.

00:16:58.427 --> 00:17:04.097
The reason is the media of cinema is in Los Angeles

00:17:04.217 --> 00:17:09.500
and they are generating all these funny ideas

00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:15.229
about insulting Shri Ganesha within us.

00:17:15.349 --> 00:17:20.450
This is the reason why all the time

00:17:20.570 --> 00:17:24.660
there is a complete danger for these people

00:17:24.781 --> 00:17:28.361
who are living in that area who support that.

00:17:28.481 --> 00:17:34.447
Also America seems to be quite in danger as far as the nature is concerned.

00:17:34.567 --> 00:17:39.934
The reason is from America all these ideas ooze out

00:17:40.054 --> 00:17:42.995
and people accept them blindfolded.

00:17:43.115 --> 00:17:45.778
I don’t know why they accept these ideas.

00:17:45.898 --> 00:17:49.670
These ideas have come to us, say, we can say that Freud has brought it.

00:17:49.790 --> 00:17:53.348
Now Freud could not prosper in Germany.

00:17:53.468 --> 00:17:55.915
He was here, he was in Austria,

00:17:56.035 --> 00:17:59.404
he could not prosper here; people didn’t listen to him

00:17:59.524 --> 00:18:02.791
but when he went to America, he got all the support

00:18:02.911 --> 00:18:07.693
and with that support he prospered.

00:18:08.067 --> 00:18:11.426
He got that support because

00:18:11.596 --> 00:18:19.254
he opposed completely the idea of leading a chaste life.

00:18:19.730 --> 00:18:22.726
And he said, “This is all absurd, this is all nonsensical

00:18:22.846 --> 00:18:25.207
and one should not listen to all these things.”

00:18:25.328 --> 00:18:27.889
And he started the whole theory

00:18:28.009 --> 00:18:37.527
on a very, very demeaning principles and people accepted.

00:18:38.456 --> 00:18:42.705
Then same Germans, same Austrians, same Europeans

00:18:42.825 --> 00:18:46.122
accepted Freud blindfolded.

00:18:47.889 --> 00:18:53.489
Because somehow when it comes from America it becomes collective.

00:18:53.609 --> 00:19:03.403
Because as you know America is the country of Shri Krishna

00:19:03.524 --> 00:19:11.125
who is for the people, who is for collective

00:19:11.245 --> 00:19:15.789
and that’s how whatever comes from America becomes collective.

00:19:15.909 --> 00:19:18.752
And if it is poison it spreads very fast

00:19:18.872 --> 00:19:23.599
and it really paralyzes the whole world.

00:19:23.719 --> 00:19:26.613
So now we have to be wise

00:19:26.733 --> 00:19:34.908
to see what is destroying us and what is destroying our inner being.

00:19:35.029 --> 00:19:38.098
For Sahaja Yogis it is very important

00:19:38.218 --> 00:19:43.364
because if say there’s a cloth or a sari

00:19:44.277 --> 00:19:46.911
which is blown off by the wind,

00:19:47.031 --> 00:19:51.485
even if you can hold it on one corner, you can hold it.

00:19:51.605 --> 00:19:55.345
And after some time the whole thing can subside.

00:19:55.465 --> 00:20:01.198
And this is what has to happen actually to the world,

00:20:01.318 --> 00:20:09.954
when Sahaja yogis will hold the sari, we can call,

00:20:10.074 --> 00:20:19.364
or this Universe with their wisdom and firm faith in Sahaja Yoga.

00:20:19.886 --> 00:20:26.074
Otherwise they can be blown off also if they are not rightly placed,

00:20:26.195 --> 00:20:28.213
if they are not grounded,

00:20:28.334 --> 00:20:35.520
if they are not fixed to their own enlightened faith of Sahaja Yoga

00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:37.950
they can be blown off with this wind

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:44.302
which is there to torture the whole world, to destroy the whole world.

00:20:44.422 --> 00:20:47.781
So the responsibility of Sahaja yogis is very important

00:20:47.902 --> 00:20:51.493
that their Ganesha principle should be all right.

00:20:51.614 --> 00:20:54.521
If it is not all right then

00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:59.819
the whole of Sahaja Yoga movement can collapse.

00:21:00.867 --> 00:21:04.791
For ladies and for men, I have to make a humble request

00:21:04.911 --> 00:21:08.815
that they should try to put their Shri Ganesha

00:21:08.935 --> 00:21:15.414
in a very respectable position in their lifestyle.

00:21:15.535 --> 00:21:19.795
That should be the highest, the most important

00:21:19.915 --> 00:21:26.537
and also every day to be remembered.

00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:35.388
That we are very much blessed by Shri Ganesha to get our Self-realization.

00:21:35.991 --> 00:21:40.014
There are so many qualities of Shri Ganesha which I have described.

00:21:40.165 --> 00:21:44.627
One of them is that He is a child.

00:21:44.747 --> 00:21:47.951
And He is very humble, He is very playful,

00:21:48.071 --> 00:21:51.802
He is very interesting and He is extremely humble

00:21:51.923 --> 00:21:54.587
and despite His weight, He is very lightweight

00:21:54.707 --> 00:21:58.512
because He can sit on a small little mouse.

00:21:58.632 --> 00:22:00.388
He doesn’t try to show off,

00:22:00.508 --> 00:22:06.604
He doesn’t have His vahanas as great as Vishnu’s or anything.

00:22:06.724 --> 00:22:10.530
His vahana is very simple, the simplest,

00:22:12.421 --> 00:22:19.385
or we can say the smallest creature which can really crawl is a mouse

00:22:19.575 --> 00:22:23.519
and He uses this mouse. With this mouse

00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:30.843
He expresses His own power that He doesn’t need any other vehicle.

00:22:30.963 --> 00:22:35.072
It’s His vehicle, is His simplicity.

00:22:35.192 --> 00:22:41.095
He moves, He penetrates and He affects the lives of people

00:22:41.215 --> 00:22:46.941
through very, very simple, sweet methods.

00:22:47.798 --> 00:22:51.565
In Sahaja Yoga we have to realize how do we impress others?

00:22:51.685 --> 00:22:54.569
For example, nobody will be impressed in Sahaja Yoga

00:22:54.689 --> 00:22:58.866
if you have a very great car or anything

00:22:58.986 --> 00:23:06.887
or if you have very wealthy expression of your life.

00:23:07.007 --> 00:23:09.432
Nobody feels impressed, I have seen that.

00:23:09.552 --> 00:23:16.953
What impresses people is the simple expression of your love

00:23:17.326 --> 00:23:20.015
through certain gestures,

00:23:20.136 --> 00:23:25.836
through certain presents, through certain behaviors.

00:23:26.058 --> 00:23:28.730
And I have seen people who are very sweet,

00:23:28.850 --> 00:23:34.981
who just express themselves in such an innocent simple childlike manner

00:23:35.101 --> 00:23:39.017
that goes into the heart of the people.

00:23:39.137 --> 00:23:42.981
I mean they describe to Me sometimes the Sahaja yogis,

00:23:43.101 --> 00:23:47.294
other Sahaja yogis, it is very surprising how they express

00:23:47.414 --> 00:23:54.427
their appreciation of other Sahaja yogis,

00:23:54.547 --> 00:24:03.869
is very, very sweet and extremely loving, delicate,

00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:07.468
all that is like a child.

00:24:07.606 --> 00:24:12.498
How a child plays around and how he amuses you,

00:24:12.618 --> 00:24:22.275
how the child tries to do things for you.

00:24:22.396 --> 00:24:26.780
Like I know My grandchildren,

00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:29.495
they would be sitting outside when I was having My bath.

00:24:29.616 --> 00:24:31.398
They were all born-realized.

00:24:31.519 --> 00:24:34.479
So when I came out what I find, they are sitting there

00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:36.496
with the powder to be put on My feet,

00:24:36.616 --> 00:24:38.985
with the scent to be put on My hands,

00:24:39.106 --> 00:24:42.011
I mean all such things they would be there.

00:24:42.132 --> 00:24:47.240
And I never told them, nobody told them but they would be sitting there.

00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:51.267
If I am lying down

00:24:51.387 --> 00:24:55.692
then they would come and cover Me up and all the time trying to see

00:24:55.812 --> 00:24:58.530
how they can look after Me,

00:24:58.650 --> 00:25:03.823
like, as if they are My parents or they are bigger than Me

00:25:03.944 --> 00:25:08.889
and also to guide Me, in a way.

00:25:09.010 --> 00:25:13.098
For example if I am walking then if they see a stone or something,

00:25:13.218 --> 00:25:15.890
then they would put their hands, “Nana, You don’t come here,

00:25:16.011 --> 00:25:18.346
there is a stone here. You be careful, go that way.”

00:25:18.466 --> 00:25:19.876
As if I have no eyes to see,

00:25:19.997 --> 00:25:22.978
they are the ones who are My eyes who are telling Me to do all.

00:25:23.098 --> 00:25:27.566
So sweet, I have seen in their childhood how careful they were

00:25:27.687 --> 00:25:33.340
and they knew what I like, what I don’t like.

00:25:33.461 --> 00:25:37.650
So sweet and so assuring

00:25:37.770 --> 00:25:45.488
that they were all the time trying just to understand Me.

00:25:46.592 --> 00:25:50.727
That is what is the other quality of Shri Ganesha is

00:25:50.869 --> 00:25:55.367
that He always tries to please His Mother.

00:25:55.660 --> 00:25:59.926
He doesn’t want to do anything that will make Her unhappy.

00:26:00.052 --> 00:26:02.120
He doesn’t say, “No.”

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:05.043
With some Sahaja yogis have a bad habit.

00:26:05.164 --> 00:26:07.654
If I tell them something they’ll say, “No, not that.”

00:26:07.775 --> 00:26:09.235
This is not to be done.

00:26:09.355 --> 00:26:13.426
The respect of the Mother one has to learn from Shri Ganesha.

00:26:13.546 --> 00:26:21.625
In that I find people are little over-smart.

00:26:21.871 --> 00:26:26.348
Say if I say something, immediately they'll correct Me, “No, not that.”

00:26:27.113 --> 00:26:32.952
This smartness is not very helpful, I think.

00:26:33.072 --> 00:26:38.072
Because if I say something, if I may say also that today just now,

00:26:38.192 --> 00:26:44.716
“It is morning time,” supposing I say.

00:26:45.851 --> 00:26:48.827
Now you will immediately go, “No, no, no, it is not morning time.

00:26:48.948 --> 00:26:51.390
Can’t You see - this is evening time?”

00:26:52.807 --> 00:26:54.993
So what have you achieved?

00:26:55.644 --> 00:26:58.020
I know it is evening time.

00:27:01.367 --> 00:27:05.073
But why did I say, “It is morning time?” Just to see.

00:27:07.048 --> 00:27:09.459
You don’t achieve anything by that.

00:27:09.579 --> 00:27:14.846
By saying “No, not that, this was not so, this is so,” this is smartness.

00:27:15.488 --> 00:27:19.185
But with this smartness, you outsmart yourself.

00:27:19.956 --> 00:27:22.670
So what did you achieve it? You see, what you have to show?

00:27:22.791 --> 00:27:25.947
See, what did you achieve?

00:27:26.067 --> 00:27:30.313
By doing these comments or saying like this or talking like this,

00:27:30.434 --> 00:27:33.583
what did you achieve? Nothing.

00:27:35.289 --> 00:27:38.028
But you are tested all the time.

00:27:38.464 --> 00:27:46.306
And in that testing you find out what’s wrong with you.

00:27:47.529 --> 00:27:50.678
It's very important for people who are more close to Me

00:27:50.798 --> 00:27:54.133
to understand that if I say something,

00:27:54.253 --> 00:27:59.154
do not take it very literally, you see, because I am Mahamaya also.

00:27:59.274 --> 00:28:03.042
If I say something it may be just to test you.

00:28:03.162 --> 00:28:06.427
Then you go on, “No, not this, not that.”

00:28:09.070 --> 00:28:13.925
It’s the mind which is just absorbing

00:28:14.045 --> 00:28:18.274
even the testing, it's taking the testing.

00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:27.192
Then only you will know that you are being tested

00:28:27.312 --> 00:28:31.952
and that your testing is just to see

00:28:32.072 --> 00:28:36.709
how far deeply you understand Me.

00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:43.750
But there are also some other people who misinterpret Me.

00:28:43.870 --> 00:28:46.623
I’ve seen, it is very wrong to do that

00:28:46.744 --> 00:28:50.496
but it comes because they are not wise enough.

00:28:50.617 --> 00:28:52.974
They misinterpret, they want to say,

00:28:53.095 --> 00:28:58.159
“This Mother said, that Mother said, this is not good, that is not.”

00:28:58.341 --> 00:29:06.479
They try to show off themselves

00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:10.144
by saying that “We have understood Mother very well.”

00:29:10.319 --> 00:29:13.987
It’s not easy to understand Me, I must tell you very frankly.

00:29:14.107 --> 00:29:16.020
You cannot understand Me very well,

00:29:16.141 --> 00:29:18.768
only thing try to understand yourself.

00:29:18.889 --> 00:29:21.647
I am like a mirror for you.

00:29:21.767 --> 00:29:25.117
So when you look into the mirror, what do you see,

00:29:25.238 --> 00:29:30.425
you cannot understand mirror, but you can understand yourself.

00:29:30.714 --> 00:29:38.767
So whenever you look into the mirror you try to understand yourself.

00:29:39.092 --> 00:29:41.923
You don’t look into the mirror to understand the mirror.

00:29:42.043 --> 00:29:47.062
Once you try to understand the mirror, the mirror will be broken and finished.

00:29:48.703 --> 00:29:51.073
And your image will be also finished.

00:29:51.681 --> 00:29:57.803
So this is a very simple thing, but quite subtle.

00:29:57.923 --> 00:30:01.382
And that’s what is the quality of Shri Ganesha.

00:30:01.502 --> 00:30:06.649
That He knows what His Mother will like, each and everything,

00:30:06.770 --> 00:30:13.477
and He does everything that is good for Him,

00:30:13.597 --> 00:30:17.379
because by that He is pleasing His Mother.

00:30:17.795 --> 00:30:21.823
His complete dedication is to the Mother,

00:30:21.944 --> 00:30:26.785
is not to any other thing, not to any other deities,

00:30:26.906 --> 00:30:28.701
He fought with all of them.

00:30:28.822 --> 00:30:33.179
He is not bothered about who others are.

00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:36.952
He goes to all of them through the understanding of the Mother

00:30:37.073 --> 00:30:39.974
and respects them through the understanding of the Mother.

00:30:40.095 --> 00:30:43.549
But some people, I have seen, still cannot do that.

00:30:43.670 --> 00:30:48.432
They still stick on to some sort of a deity they have been worshiping,

00:30:48.553 --> 00:30:51.414
some sort of an ideology they have been having.

00:30:51.535 --> 00:30:57.555
Then they are not fully in connection with Me.

00:30:57.676 --> 00:31:03.949
And that is what is that He is, just in connection with His Mother.

00:31:04.070 --> 00:31:06.075
To Him She is everything.

00:31:06.197 --> 00:31:09.730
She is the source of knowledge, She is the source of Joy,

00:31:09.851 --> 00:31:12.427
She is the source of Truth.

00:31:13.074 --> 00:31:16.444
He doesn’t have to look to anybody else.

00:31:16.565 --> 00:31:24.394
Now it looks very egoistical to say these things in modern times,

00:31:24.515 --> 00:31:29.824
a Woman saying like that. That, “You all behave in that manner.”

00:31:30.126 --> 00:31:37.490
But you can understand that if you have to gain anything,

00:31:37.610 --> 00:31:44.252
if you have to achieve any knowledge within,

00:31:44.990 --> 00:31:53.511
if you have to ascend higher, then you have to learn from Shri Ganesha.

00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:59.268
What He does and what is His relationship with His Mother

00:31:59.388 --> 00:32:06.276
- which is purifying, nourishing and result oriented,

00:32:06.396 --> 00:32:10.119
that the result is that you ascend gradually.

00:32:11.614 --> 00:32:14.362
As I was telling yesterday to some people

00:32:14.483 --> 00:32:19.830
that I have not said everything from the very beginning,

00:32:19.951 --> 00:32:21.099
all the subtle things.

00:32:21.220 --> 00:32:26.007
Gradually you have grown and accordingly I have talked.

00:32:26.251 --> 00:32:29.585
If you were like Shri Ganesha, all of you, from the very beginning

00:32:29.705 --> 00:32:31.367
I would have told you everything

00:32:31.487 --> 00:32:34.751
but Shri Ganesha doesn’t require even to know anything.

00:32:34.871 --> 00:32:38.713
He already knows, He is a very matured person.

00:32:38.833 --> 00:32:43.119
Or we can say the most matured deity is Shri Ganesha.

00:32:43.239 --> 00:32:48.857
Now what you have done is that with wisdom

00:32:48.977 --> 00:32:52.714
you have grown and gradually I have told you of many things.

00:32:52.834 --> 00:32:57.246
But I didn’t talk of many things, like the Genesis,

00:32:57.366 --> 00:32:59.896
like the beginning of our life. How we came.

00:33:00.016 --> 00:33:05.307
I have said it in a way, in a very, very gross way

00:33:05.427 --> 00:33:08.796
but all in subtleties I have not said much.

00:33:08.916 --> 00:33:15.669
Because I don’t want you to get to any discussion

00:33:16.804 --> 00:33:22.349
or to any point which cannot be verified by your vibrations.

00:33:22.469 --> 00:33:28.029
Whatever you can verify by your vibrations becomes your knowledge.

00:33:28.149 --> 00:33:32.081
That is what gradually is told to you.

00:33:32.201 --> 00:33:34.291
You should not interfere.

00:33:34.411 --> 00:33:39.210
Or you should not indulge into those books and things

00:33:39.331 --> 00:33:45.493
which talk of the origin of the Earth
and the origin of this and that.

00:33:45.613 --> 00:33:50.658
You should not get into these things
because your mind will be diverted,

00:33:50.778 --> 00:33:53.979
you will take to knowledge which may not be knowledge

00:33:54.099 --> 00:33:56.738
and then you will start thinking,

00:33:56.859 --> 00:34:01.057
“Oh I don’t know this part, I don’t know that part.”

00:34:01.177 --> 00:34:05.777
What you have to know is very simple is - what are you?

00:34:05.897 --> 00:34:09.425
You are the spirit and the light of the spirit

00:34:09.546 --> 00:34:14.447
will tell you everything gradually as much as you can bear it.

00:34:14.567 --> 00:34:19.054
It will not tell you something that you cannot bear.

00:34:19.174 --> 00:34:25.578
It’s a very good analogy when we say that “You are the light,”

00:34:25.752 --> 00:34:31.525
but the light which you are carrying is
very different from this ordinary light.

00:34:31.647 --> 00:34:36.183
This light doesn’t understand, it doesn’t think.

00:34:36.304 --> 00:34:42.360
Now the light which you are carrying is a light which understands, thinks

00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:48.080
and it gives you that much of light whatever you can bear.

00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:52.172
It won’t flash, if it will flash you’ll be shocked.

00:34:52.299 --> 00:34:53.815
It won’t dim down.

00:34:53.936 --> 00:34:59.476
It will be absolutely in relation to what you can understand.

00:34:59.634 --> 00:35:03.653
Sometimes the deities emit too much of vibrations in pujas, I have seen.

00:35:03.773 --> 00:35:08.325
But if you cannot bear it they don’t enter into you.

00:35:08.445 --> 00:35:11.465
They trouble Me but they won’t enter into you.

00:35:11.585 --> 00:35:15.449
So one must understand that what is important is not

00:35:15.569 --> 00:35:18.679
what you know about this and know about that, and know about that

00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:20.091
- is not so important.

00:35:20.212 --> 00:35:23.587
What is important is what stage you have reached.

00:35:23.708 --> 00:35:27.520
At what maturity you are in Sahaja Yoga.

00:35:27.703 --> 00:35:31.482
Now there are so many qualities of Shri Ganesha as I told you

00:35:31.602 --> 00:35:35.798
which I think there is no time
today to talk about it.

00:35:35.919 --> 00:35:39.064
But gradually I have been talking about all His qualities

00:35:39.184 --> 00:35:43.973
and all of them can be expressed and manifested in your being

00:35:44.094 --> 00:35:50.519
if you are really respecting Him, absolutely.

00:35:50.544 --> 00:35:54.942
That's the only way one can manifest His qualities.

00:35:55.125 --> 00:35:56.188
May God bless you.
