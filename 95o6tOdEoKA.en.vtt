00:02.180 --> 00:05.046
Shri Ganesha Puja Berlin, Germany July 21, 1993

00:05.499 --> 00:11.023
Today, we are going to worship Shri Ganesha.

00:12.396 --> 00:19.382
As you know in the whole of Europe, America, England

00:20.841 --> 00:26.618
they have lost faith in Shri Ganesha.

00:26.927 --> 00:34.430
Nor do they care for His powers and for His blessings.

00:35.429 --> 00:46.441
As a result all His blessings are not on these countries.

00:47.189 --> 00:51.544
The first blessing of Shri Ganesha

00:51.672 --> 00:56.675
which is, I think is the highest is the wisdom

00:56.796 --> 01:05.396
that we learn what is good for us and what is bad for us;

01:05.738 --> 01:09.795
what is constructive and what is destructive;

01:09.916 --> 01:17.506
what should we do to achieve our Self-Realization.

01:20.093 --> 01:28.498
Those people who have got wisdom are very lucky people.

01:28.618 --> 01:40.008
But wisdom comes from no source but your own understanding of life.

01:40.128 --> 01:48.664
When a person starts thinking, “Why am I doing such and such thing?

01:49.498 --> 01:54.558
What is the effect of my doing?

01:54.678 --> 02:00.008
What is the result of my behavior?

02:00.128 --> 02:09.655
Is it good for me or bad for me?” then wisdom comes.

02:09.775 --> 02:14.295
Even if some people know that this is bad for them,

02:14.416 --> 02:19.219
still they do not have power to control themselves.

02:19.339 --> 02:23.938
Still they do lots of bad things which they should not do.

02:24.073 --> 02:28.945
The reason is the power of wisdom is not there.

02:29.303 --> 02:36.771
A person is wise who does not only know what is right and wrong

02:36.892 --> 02:44.510
but also he knows very well his own power not to do something wrong.

02:44.647 --> 02:46.798
He just does not do it.

02:46.919 --> 02:54.686
Wisdom is a complete power within ourselves by which we try nothing,

02:54.839 --> 02:58.905
it just spontaneously works through us

02:59.033 --> 03:04.663
and we do things which are proper and right.

03:07.797 --> 03:15.073
In this wisdom many people have risen very high in life.

03:15.978 --> 03:21.672
For example, we’ll take the example of Kabir.

03:21.792 --> 03:28.436
Kabir was born to a weaver.

03:28.556 --> 03:31.087
They say they don’t think he was born to him

03:31.208 --> 03:34.521
but he was found by a weaver, whatever it is.

03:36.073 --> 03:41.636
And he belonged to Muslim family.

03:43.066 --> 03:47.741
But he realized that the Muslims

03:47.861 --> 03:55.600
as they are practicing their Islam is not going to give him what he wants.

03:56.986 --> 04:02.218
He has to seek his self, he has to know himself.

04:02.416 --> 04:10.183
So what did he do, is to go on the bank of river Ganges in Benares

04:10.304 --> 04:15.006
and he stayed there waiting for a great Realized soul

04:15.127 --> 04:18.356
called as Ramananda, Swami Ramananda.

04:18.477 --> 04:22.844
When this Swami Ramananda came back after his bath,

04:22.965 --> 04:25.958
immediately he caught hold of his feet.

04:26.078 --> 04:30.407
After bath if somebody catches the feet of any Brahmin,

04:30.528 --> 04:32.218
he would shout at him.

04:32.338 --> 04:35.825
But he was a saint, he was not a Brahmin.

04:35.945 --> 04:39.098
He said, “My son what do you want?”

04:39.218 --> 04:43.848
He said, “Sir, give me initiation.

04:43.968 --> 04:46.615
I want Self-Realization.”

04:48.170 --> 04:52.030
And Swami Ramananda immediately agreed.

04:52.150 --> 04:56.053
All the other people said, “Sir, he is a Muslim,

04:56.173 --> 04:59.961
he is an orphan, brought up in a Muslim family.

05:00.081 --> 05:02.615
How can you give Realization?

05:02.735 --> 05:07.174
He’ll not accept any of the principles

05:07.294 --> 05:11.631
which look like coming from Hindu religion.”

05:12.996 --> 05:18.681
Ramananda looked at Kabir; he could see a great seeker there.

05:19.213 --> 05:22.016
He said, “You don’t know him, I know him.”

05:22.136 --> 05:29.348
And he took him with him and Kabira became a great saint after that.

05:30.277 --> 05:34.412
He’s accepted by Hindus and Muslims

05:35.134 --> 05:39.613
because he had that power of wisdom,

05:39.733 --> 05:47.339
he went to a man who was not belonging to his religion,

05:47.609 --> 05:49.934
who may not have accepted him,

05:50.056 --> 05:55.119
who might have just thrown him in the river, also possibly.

05:55.240 --> 05:58.185
But he knew also through his wisdom

05:58.328 --> 06:02.313
that, “This man is the one who will love me,

06:02.434 --> 06:05.914
because I am a seeker of Truth.”

06:06.034 --> 06:09.254
So this power of truth works

06:09.375 --> 06:11.936
in not only that you know what is right and wrong,

06:12.057 --> 06:18.151
again I say, but that you just don’t do something that is wrong.

06:18.426 --> 06:22.988
Now one may say, “Mother what is the source again, of this wisdom?”

06:23.108 --> 06:26.953
The source is Shri Ganesha.

06:28.373 --> 06:35.563
The source is Shri Ganesha, which is the Giver of wisdom.

06:37.158 --> 06:41.288
Once Shri Ganesha is insulted

06:41.409 --> 06:49.639
and He disappears behind the clouds of ignorance,

06:49.759 --> 06:54.353
then people start doing things which are unwise.

06:54.774 --> 06:57.593
This happens with many things.

06:57.713 --> 07:03.066
Supposing these days in the democratic countries,

07:03.186 --> 07:08.554
they are not supposed to say anything about the morality,

07:08.674 --> 07:13.631
about how people should behave, what should be their relationships.

07:13.751 --> 07:16.332
They don’t try to look after the society

07:16.453 --> 07:19.592
because they think looking after the society is not our job,

07:19.713 --> 07:23.137
it’s a private affair, it’s a private thing.

07:23.257 --> 07:27.451
As a result, people take freedom into their hands

07:27.572 --> 07:31.096
and start insulting Shri Ganesha.

07:34.530 --> 07:37.770
When Shri Ganesha is insulted,

07:38.867 --> 07:43.926
complete blockage takes place in a human being, I think.

07:44.047 --> 07:45.935
He becomes an idiot.

07:46.056 --> 07:48.337
He becomes a stupid fellow.

07:48.457 --> 07:57.286
He doesn’t understand how to go further with wisdom.

07:58.587 --> 08:05.334
Without wisdom whatever steps one takes is destructive.

08:05.468 --> 08:10.378
So this is the first quality of Shri Ganesha

08:10.498 --> 08:15.642
that He gives us, bestows upon us wisdom.

08:16.351 --> 08:21.270
So we have to respect Shri Ganesha within us,

08:21.390 --> 08:26.059
is very important specially for all these democratic countries

08:26.179 --> 08:30.287
which are now going to dogs, their families are destroyed

08:30.408 --> 08:33.022
because their lifestyle is so horrible,

08:33.142 --> 08:40.950
their children are ruined, in every way they are in a big jeopardy.

08:41.070 --> 08:48.289
This wisdom can be easily brought back if we awaken their Kundalini.

08:48.409 --> 08:54.714
If the Kundalini is awakened this Ganesha can be awakened,

08:54.834 --> 08:58.713
because without His help Kundalini cannot be awakened.

08:58.833 --> 09:05.265
And if Shri Ganesha knows that Kundalini is to be awakened

09:05.386 --> 09:09.672
He forgives everything, forgets everything

09:09.793 --> 09:14.479
and comes to assist you, to support the Kundalini’s ascent.

09:14.599 --> 09:18.014
At every chakra He is there to support you,

09:18.134 --> 09:23.053
till you get Realization He is there to help you.

09:26.233 --> 09:31.710
In all these countries the missing point is their wisdom

09:31.830 --> 09:35.014
and that’s why you find so much of destruction,

09:35.134 --> 09:37.455
so much of nonsense going on

09:37.576 --> 09:42.054
and you can’t understand why people are so stupid.

09:43.872 --> 09:48.753
The another power that Shri Ganesha has

09:48.873 --> 09:52.541
is He generates innocence within us.

09:52.661 --> 09:54.488
We respect our innocence.

09:54.608 --> 09:56.507
We respect our chastity.

09:56.627 --> 10:03.711
We respect a lifestyle which is decent and decorous.

10:03.893 --> 10:06.589
In every scripture is written

10:06.709 --> 10:11.921
that we should dress up in a way that we are decent and decorous

10:12.064 --> 10:15.208
and that our body should not

10:15.328 --> 10:28.028
in any way express a indecent feeling or indecent behavior on our part.

10:29.938 --> 10:32.525
This is the reason why in Sahaja Yoga

10:32.646 --> 10:36.370
we have to be particular about how we dress up.

10:36.868 --> 10:39.055
I think Sahaja Yogis have realized it

10:39.176 --> 10:43.636
that our dress should be decent, should be dignified

10:43.757 --> 10:53.909
and that we should in no way try to show our vulgarity.

10:55.038 --> 10:59.458
Because if innocence is the most important thing a human being should have,

10:59.579 --> 11:06.306
if that is the complete decoration of a human being,

11:06.426 --> 11:14.677
then one should look after one’s own chastity and one’s own morality.

11:15.121 --> 11:17.373
In some countries, of course,

11:17.494 --> 11:20.066
they think that chastity is only meant for women

11:20.187 --> 11:22.060
and not for men.

11:22.180 --> 11:23.639
But it's not true.

11:23.759 --> 11:26.983
That’s what the Islamic people believe. It's very wrong.

11:27.103 --> 11:29.855
It is meant for both of them.

11:29.975 --> 11:41.945
Like a person who is trying to force the other side,

11:42.066 --> 11:46.943
like the men trying to force the women to be chaste

11:47.515 --> 11:51.677
and themselves are not chaste, the women will not be chaste.

11:51.797 --> 11:54.995
They may look, appear, they may try to be out of fear,

11:55.115 --> 12:00.501
but if they get a chance they will take to life which is wrong.

12:00.622 --> 12:02.504
Because they see the other party,

12:02.625 --> 12:05.119
the men trying to dominate them,

12:05.240 --> 12:08.910
then they think, “What’s wrong, if they can do it why not we do it?”

12:09.030 --> 12:13.749
So the whole society has to take to very decent life

12:13.869 --> 12:24.028
and to a very, very decorous, dignified lifestyle.

12:24.149 --> 12:29.996
It's not only in dress but even day-to-day life it is important.

12:32.131 --> 12:39.451
Otherwise a kind of a insecurity start working among men and women

12:39.571 --> 12:45.584
and too much complications, too much complicated life starts.

12:48.600 --> 12:52.187
The third quality which I am saying today

12:52.308 --> 12:55.461
is that a person who is innocent

12:55.582 --> 13:01.909
should not fear because God looks after innocent people.

13:02.029 --> 13:04.201
They are always protected.

13:04.321 --> 13:09.774
If anybody tries to harm the innocent God protects them,

13:09.894 --> 13:14.846
and that’s how you have seen many children who fall from high stories

13:14.966 --> 13:18.690
they are saved and so many things happen.

13:18.810 --> 13:22.650
But also we see many children are being killed

13:22.771 --> 13:25.989
by people who are extremely aggressive.

13:26.110 --> 13:31.551
Of course that is very, very cruel and wrong to do,

13:31.672 --> 13:36.454
to kill the innocent children but when these children are killed,

13:36.575 --> 13:39.664
actually nobody is killed as you know very well,

13:39.784 --> 13:42.525
the whole world gets shaken up;

13:42.652 --> 13:47.650
anything happens to children the whole world gets shaken up

13:47.770 --> 13:52.393
and then the whole world start protecting the innocent.

13:52.513 --> 13:56.123
If some people, men are killed or something happens to them

13:56.244 --> 14:00.172
nobody is so much bothered, but even one child is in difficulty

14:00.292 --> 14:04.000
all the people combine together to save that child.

14:04.120 --> 14:06.202
It’s so important,

14:06.322 --> 14:09.412
it's not the child, but the innocence of the child

14:09.532 --> 14:14.030
that generates that feeling that we have to save

14:14.296 --> 14:19.730
that innocent, little thing which is having a problem.

14:19.850 --> 14:23.143
That’s why in the whole history you find

14:23.263 --> 14:30.600
wherever there have been description of children being killed

14:30.720 --> 14:34.845
or where innocence has been attacked,

14:35.083 --> 14:40.813
the whole society, historically also, has revolted against it.

14:40.978 --> 14:44.861
And this revolt comes from Shri Ganesha’s power,

14:44.981 --> 14:51.880
that He can definitely create a feeling of detest

14:52.001 --> 14:55.334
for people who try to be unkind to children.

14:55.454 --> 14:57.351
If you see in the newspaper also

14:57.472 --> 15:00.574
they will show how the children are suffering.

15:00.992 --> 15:03.638
What is the problem of the children, what they suffer?

15:03.758 --> 15:11.524
It’s a very, very touching thing to hurt the children.

15:11.644 --> 15:17.301
In Sahaja Yoga we have now children who are born-realized

15:17.422 --> 15:20.243
and we understand their innocence.

15:20.363 --> 15:23.563
We try to keep them out of bounds

15:23.683 --> 15:28.045
from all these horrible things that are happening today in the world.

15:28.165 --> 15:30.135
And we are trying to look after them

15:30.255 --> 15:35.554
so that they grow up into children who are not only born realized,

15:35.675 --> 15:43.383
but who will save others from the dilemma of getting themselves ruined

15:43.504 --> 15:48.073
and by not respecting their innocence.

15:48.343 --> 15:54.146
This respect of innocence once it’s developed,

15:55.043 --> 15:59.696
through such happenings, through their own children,

15:59.816 --> 16:06.441
through their own relationships, then the whole nation can be saved.

16:06.584 --> 16:09.728
Another way is to worship Shri Ganesha

16:09.849 --> 16:15.071
which comes from the Mother Earth, the principle of innocence.

16:15.270 --> 16:19.614
The Mother Earth is so innocent, whether you are good or bad,

16:19.803 --> 16:24.158
She gives you fruits, She gives you trees, She looks after you.

16:24.279 --> 16:29.806
Whether you are telling lies

16:29.926 --> 16:33.573
or you are deceiving people, still She does it.

16:33.693 --> 16:35.774
Of course up to a point

16:35.895 --> 16:41.563
and after that She may bring forth some sort of a calamity

16:41.685 --> 16:44.888
like an earthquake, or something like that.

16:45.008 --> 16:48.929
Now the earthquake mostly suspected always

16:49.057 --> 16:52.664
in the Los Angeles area, very much.

16:52.806 --> 16:58.307
And they have practically every year there is a shake-up there.

16:58.427 --> 17:04.097
The reason is the media of cinema is in Los Angeles

17:04.217 --> 17:09.500
and they are generating all these funny ideas

17:09.620 --> 17:15.229
about insulting Shri Ganesha within us.

17:15.349 --> 17:20.450
This is the reason why all the time

17:20.570 --> 17:24.660
there is a complete danger for these people

17:24.781 --> 17:28.361
who are living in that area who support that.

17:28.481 --> 17:34.447
Also America seems to be quite in danger as far as the nature is concerned.

17:34.567 --> 17:39.934
The reason is from America all these ideas ooze out

17:40.054 --> 17:42.995
and people accept them blindfolded.

17:43.115 --> 17:45.778
I don’t know why they accept these ideas.

17:45.898 --> 17:49.670
These ideas have come to us, say, we can say that Freud has brought it.

17:49.790 --> 17:53.348
Now Freud could not prosper in Germany.

17:53.468 --> 17:55.915
He was here, he was in Austria,

17:56.035 --> 17:59.404
he could not prosper here; people didn’t listen to him

17:59.524 --> 18:02.791
but when he went to America, he got all the support

18:02.911 --> 18:07.693
and with that support he prospered.

18:08.067 --> 18:11.426
He got that support because

18:11.596 --> 18:19.254
he opposed completely the idea of leading a chaste life.

18:19.730 --> 18:22.726
And he said, “This is all absurd, this is all nonsensical

18:22.846 --> 18:25.207
and one should not listen to all these things.”

18:25.328 --> 18:27.889
And he started the whole theory

18:28.009 --> 18:37.527
on a very, very demeaning principles and people accepted.

18:38.456 --> 18:42.705
Then same Germans, same Austrians, same Europeans

18:42.825 --> 18:46.122
accepted Freud blindfolded.

18:47.889 --> 18:53.489
Because somehow when it comes from America it becomes collective.

18:53.609 --> 19:03.403
Because as you know America is the country of Shri Krishna

19:03.524 --> 19:11.125
who is for the people, who is for collective

19:11.245 --> 19:15.789
and that’s how whatever comes from America becomes collective.

19:15.909 --> 19:18.752
And if it is poison it spreads very fast

19:18.872 --> 19:23.599
and it really paralyzes the whole world.

19:23.719 --> 19:26.613
So now we have to be wise

19:26.733 --> 19:34.908
to see what is destroying us and what is destroying our inner being.

19:35.029 --> 19:38.098
For Sahaja Yogis it is very important

19:38.218 --> 19:43.364
because if say there’s a cloth or a sari

19:44.277 --> 19:46.911
which is blown off by the wind,

19:47.031 --> 19:51.485
even if you can hold it on one corner, you can hold it.

19:51.605 --> 19:55.345
And after some time the whole thing can subside.

19:55.465 --> 20:01.198
And this is what has to happen actually to the world,

20:01.318 --> 20:09.954
when Sahaja yogis will hold the sari, we can call,

20:10.074 --> 20:19.364
or this Universe with their wisdom and firm faith in Sahaja Yoga.

20:19.886 --> 20:26.074
Otherwise they can be blown off also if they are not rightly placed,

20:26.195 --> 20:28.213
if they are not grounded,

20:28.334 --> 20:35.520
if they are not fixed to their own enlightened faith of Sahaja Yoga

20:35.640 --> 20:37.950
they can be blown off with this wind

20:38.070 --> 20:44.302
which is there to torture the whole world, to destroy the whole world.

20:44.422 --> 20:47.781
So the responsibility of Sahaja yogis is very important

20:47.902 --> 20:51.493
that their Ganesha principle should be all right.

20:51.614 --> 20:54.521
If it is not all right then

20:55.600 --> 20:59.819
the whole of Sahaja Yoga movement can collapse.

21:00.867 --> 21:04.791
For ladies and for men, I have to make a humble request

21:04.911 --> 21:08.815
that they should try to put their Shri Ganesha

21:08.935 --> 21:15.414
in a very respectable position in their lifestyle.

21:15.535 --> 21:19.795
That should be the highest, the most important

21:19.915 --> 21:26.537
and also every day to be remembered.

21:27.640 --> 21:35.388
That we are very much blessed by Shri Ganesha to get our Self-realization.

21:35.991 --> 21:40.014
There are so many qualities of Shri Ganesha which I have described.

21:40.165 --> 21:44.627
One of them is that He is a child.

21:44.747 --> 21:47.951
And He is very humble, He is very playful,

21:48.071 --> 21:51.802
He is very interesting and He is extremely humble

21:51.923 --> 21:54.587
and despite His weight, He is very lightweight

21:54.707 --> 21:58.512
because He can sit on a small little mouse.

21:58.632 --> 22:00.388
He doesn’t try to show off,

22:00.508 --> 22:06.604
He doesn’t have His vahanas as great as Vishnu’s or anything.

22:06.724 --> 22:10.530
His vahana is very simple, the simplest,

22:12.421 --> 22:19.385
or we can say the smallest creature which can really crawl is a mouse

22:19.575 --> 22:23.519
and He uses this mouse. With this mouse

22:23.640 --> 22:30.843
He expresses His own power that He doesn’t need any other vehicle.

22:30.963 --> 22:35.072
It’s His vehicle, is His simplicity.

22:35.192 --> 22:41.095
He moves, He penetrates and He affects the lives of people

22:41.215 --> 22:46.941
through very, very simple, sweet methods.

22:47.798 --> 22:51.565
In Sahaja Yoga we have to realize how do we impress others?

22:51.685 --> 22:54.569
For example, nobody will be impressed in Sahaja Yoga

22:54.689 --> 22:58.866
if you have a very great car or anything

22:58.986 --> 23:06.887
or if you have very wealthy expression of your life.

23:07.007 --> 23:09.432
Nobody feels impressed, I have seen that.

23:09.552 --> 23:16.953
What impresses people is the simple expression of your love

23:17.326 --> 23:20.015
through certain gestures,

23:20.136 --> 23:25.836
through certain presents, through certain behaviors.

23:26.058 --> 23:28.730
And I have seen people who are very sweet,

23:28.850 --> 23:34.981
who just express themselves in such an innocent simple childlike manner

23:35.101 --> 23:39.017
that goes into the heart of the people.

23:39.137 --> 23:42.981
I mean they describe to Me sometimes the Sahaja yogis,

23:43.101 --> 23:47.294
other Sahaja yogis, it is very surprising how they express

23:47.414 --> 23:54.427
their appreciation of other Sahaja yogis,

23:54.547 --> 24:03.869
is very, very sweet and extremely loving, delicate,

24:03.990 --> 24:07.468
all that is like a child.

24:07.606 --> 24:12.498
How a child plays around and how he amuses you,

24:12.618 --> 24:22.275
how the child tries to do things for you.

24:22.396 --> 24:26.780
Like I know My grandchildren,

24:26.900 --> 24:29.495
they would be sitting outside when I was having My bath.

24:29.616 --> 24:31.398
They were all born-realized.

24:31.519 --> 24:34.479
So when I came out what I find, they are sitting there

24:34.600 --> 24:36.496
with the powder to be put on My feet,

24:36.616 --> 24:38.985
with the scent to be put on My hands,

24:39.106 --> 24:42.011
I mean all such things they would be there.

24:42.132 --> 24:47.240
And I never told them, nobody told them but they would be sitting there.

24:47.360 --> 24:51.267
If I am lying down

24:51.387 --> 24:55.692
then they would come and cover Me up and all the time trying to see

24:55.812 --> 24:58.530
how they can look after Me,

24:58.650 --> 25:03.823
like, as if they are My parents or they are bigger than Me

25:03.944 --> 25:08.889
and also to guide Me, in a way.

25:09.010 --> 25:13.098
For example if I am walking then if they see a stone or something,

25:13.218 --> 25:15.890
then they would put their hands, “Nana, You don’t come here,

25:16.011 --> 25:18.346
there is a stone here. You be careful, go that way.”

25:18.466 --> 25:19.876
As if I have no eyes to see,

25:19.997 --> 25:22.978
they are the ones who are My eyes who are telling Me to do all.

25:23.098 --> 25:27.566
So sweet, I have seen in their childhood how careful they were

25:27.687 --> 25:33.340
and they knew what I like, what I don’t like.

25:33.461 --> 25:37.650
So sweet and so assuring

25:37.770 --> 25:45.488
that they were all the time trying just to understand Me.

25:46.592 --> 25:50.727
That is what is the other quality of Shri Ganesha is

25:50.869 --> 25:55.367
that He always tries to please His Mother.

25:55.660 --> 25:59.926
He doesn’t want to do anything that will make Her unhappy.

26:00.052 --> 26:02.120
He doesn’t say, “No.”

26:02.240 --> 26:05.043
With some Sahaja yogis have a bad habit.

26:05.164 --> 26:07.654
If I tell them something they’ll say, “No, not that.”

26:07.775 --> 26:09.235
This is not to be done.

26:09.355 --> 26:13.426
The respect of the Mother one has to learn from Shri Ganesha.

26:13.546 --> 26:21.625
In that I find people are little over-smart.

26:21.871 --> 26:26.348
Say if I say something, immediately they'll correct Me, “No, not that.”

26:27.113 --> 26:32.952
This smartness is not very helpful, I think.

26:33.072 --> 26:38.072
Because if I say something, if I may say also that today just now,

26:38.192 --> 26:44.716
“It is morning time,” supposing I say.

26:45.851 --> 26:48.827
Now you will immediately go, “No, no, no, it is not morning time.

26:48.948 --> 26:51.390
Can’t You see - this is evening time?”

26:52.807 --> 26:54.993
So what have you achieved?

26:55.644 --> 26:58.020
I know it is evening time.

27:01.367 --> 27:05.073
But why did I say, “It is morning time?” Just to see.

27:07.048 --> 27:09.459
You don’t achieve anything by that.

27:09.579 --> 27:14.846
By saying “No, not that, this was not so, this is so,” this is smartness.

27:15.488 --> 27:19.185
But with this smartness, you outsmart yourself.

27:19.956 --> 27:22.670
So what did you achieve it? You see, what you have to show?

27:22.791 --> 27:25.947
See, what did you achieve?

27:26.067 --> 27:30.313
By doing these comments or saying like this or talking like this,

27:30.434 --> 27:33.583
what did you achieve? Nothing.

27:35.289 --> 27:38.028
But you are tested all the time.

27:38.464 --> 27:46.306
And in that testing you find out what’s wrong with you.

27:47.529 --> 27:50.678
It's very important for people who are more close to Me

27:50.798 --> 27:54.133
to understand that if I say something,

27:54.253 --> 27:59.154
do not take it very literally, you see, because I am Mahamaya also.

27:59.274 --> 28:03.042
If I say something it may be just to test you.

28:03.162 --> 28:06.427
Then you go on, “No, not this, not that.”

28:09.070 --> 28:13.925
It’s the mind which is just absorbing

28:14.045 --> 28:18.274
even the testing, it's taking the testing.

28:18.620 --> 28:27.192
Then only you will know that you are being tested

28:27.312 --> 28:31.952
and that your testing is just to see

28:32.072 --> 28:36.709
how far deeply you understand Me.

28:39.560 --> 28:43.750
But there are also some other people who misinterpret Me.

28:43.870 --> 28:46.623
I’ve seen, it is very wrong to do that

28:46.744 --> 28:50.496
but it comes because they are not wise enough.

28:50.617 --> 28:52.974
They misinterpret, they want to say,

28:53.095 --> 28:58.159
“This Mother said, that Mother said, this is not good, that is not.”

28:58.341 --> 29:06.479
They try to show off themselves

29:06.600 --> 29:10.144
by saying that “We have understood Mother very well.”

29:10.319 --> 29:13.987
It’s not easy to understand Me, I must tell you very frankly.

29:14.107 --> 29:16.020
You cannot understand Me very well,

29:16.141 --> 29:18.768
only thing try to understand yourself.

29:18.889 --> 29:21.647
I am like a mirror for you.

29:21.767 --> 29:25.117
So when you look into the mirror, what do you see,

29:25.238 --> 29:30.425
you cannot understand mirror, but you can understand yourself.

29:30.714 --> 29:38.767
So whenever you look into the mirror you try to understand yourself.

29:39.092 --> 29:41.923
You don’t look into the mirror to understand the mirror.

29:42.043 --> 29:47.062
Once you try to understand the mirror, the mirror will be broken and finished.

29:48.703 --> 29:51.073
And your image will be also finished.

29:51.681 --> 29:57.803
So this is a very simple thing, but quite subtle.

29:57.923 --> 30:01.382
And that’s what is the quality of Shri Ganesha.

30:01.502 --> 30:06.649
That He knows what His Mother will like, each and everything,

30:06.770 --> 30:13.477
and He does everything that is good for Him,

30:13.597 --> 30:17.379
because by that He is pleasing His Mother.

30:17.795 --> 30:21.823
His complete dedication is to the Mother,

30:21.944 --> 30:26.785
is not to any other thing, not to any other deities,

30:26.906 --> 30:28.701
He fought with all of them.

30:28.822 --> 30:33.179
He is not bothered about who others are.

30:33.300 --> 30:36.952
He goes to all of them through the understanding of the Mother

30:37.073 --> 30:39.974
and respects them through the understanding of the Mother.

30:40.095 --> 30:43.549
But some people, I have seen, still cannot do that.

30:43.670 --> 30:48.432
They still stick on to some sort of a deity they have been worshiping,

30:48.553 --> 30:51.414
some sort of an ideology they have been having.

30:51.535 --> 30:57.555
Then they are not fully in connection with Me.

30:57.676 --> 31:03.949
And that is what is that He is, just in connection with His Mother.

31:04.070 --> 31:06.075
To Him She is everything.

31:06.197 --> 31:09.730
She is the source of knowledge, She is the source of Joy,

31:09.851 --> 31:12.427
She is the source of Truth.

31:13.074 --> 31:16.444
He doesn’t have to look to anybody else.

31:16.565 --> 31:24.394
Now it looks very egoistical to say these things in modern times,

31:24.515 --> 31:29.824
a Woman saying like that. That, “You all behave in that manner.”

31:30.126 --> 31:37.490
But you can understand that if you have to gain anything,

31:37.610 --> 31:44.252
if you have to achieve any knowledge within,

31:44.990 --> 31:53.511
if you have to ascend higher, then you have to learn from Shri Ganesha.

31:54.120 --> 31:59.268
What He does and what is His relationship with His Mother

31:59.388 --> 32:06.276
- which is purifying, nourishing and result oriented,

32:06.396 --> 32:10.119
that the result is that you ascend gradually.

32:11.614 --> 32:14.362
As I was telling yesterday to some people

32:14.483 --> 32:19.830
that I have not said everything from the very beginning,

32:19.951 --> 32:21.099
all the subtle things.

32:21.220 --> 32:26.007
Gradually you have grown and accordingly I have talked.

32:26.251 --> 32:29.585
If you were like Shri Ganesha, all of you, from the very beginning

32:29.705 --> 32:31.367
I would have told you everything

32:31.487 --> 32:34.751
but Shri Ganesha doesn’t require even to know anything.

32:34.871 --> 32:38.713
He already knows, He is a very matured person.

32:38.833 --> 32:43.119
Or we can say the most matured deity is Shri Ganesha.

32:43.239 --> 32:48.857
Now what you have done is that with wisdom

32:48.977 --> 32:52.714
you have grown and gradually I have told you of many things.

32:52.834 --> 32:57.246
But I didn’t talk of many things, like the Genesis,

32:57.366 --> 32:59.896
like the beginning of our life. How we came.

33:00.016 --> 33:05.307
I have said it in a way, in a very, very gross way

33:05.427 --> 33:08.796
but all in subtleties I have not said much.

33:08.916 --> 33:15.669
Because I don’t want you to get to any discussion

33:16.804 --> 33:22.349
or to any point which cannot be verified by your vibrations.

33:22.469 --> 33:28.029
Whatever you can verify by your vibrations becomes your knowledge.

33:28.149 --> 33:32.081
That is what gradually is told to you.

33:32.201 --> 33:34.291
You should not interfere.

33:34.411 --> 33:39.210
Or you should not indulge into those books and things

33:39.331 --> 33:45.493
which talk of the origin of the Earth
and the origin of this and that.

33:45.613 --> 33:50.658
You should not get into these things
because your mind will be diverted,

33:50.778 --> 33:53.979
you will take to knowledge which may not be knowledge

33:54.099 --> 33:56.738
and then you will start thinking,

33:56.859 --> 34:01.057
“Oh I don’t know this part, I don’t know that part.”

34:01.177 --> 34:05.777
What you have to know is very simple is - what are you?

34:05.897 --> 34:09.425
You are the spirit and the light of the spirit

34:09.546 --> 34:14.447
will tell you everything gradually as much as you can bear it.

34:14.567 --> 34:19.054
It will not tell you something that you cannot bear.

34:19.174 --> 34:25.578
It’s a very good analogy when we say that “You are the light,”

34:25.752 --> 34:31.525
but the light which you are carrying is
very different from this ordinary light.

34:31.647 --> 34:36.183
This light doesn’t understand, it doesn’t think.

34:36.304 --> 34:42.360
Now the light which you are carrying is a light which understands, thinks

34:42.480 --> 34:48.080
and it gives you that much of light whatever you can bear.

34:48.200 --> 34:52.172
It won’t flash, if it will flash you’ll be shocked.

34:52.299 --> 34:53.815
It won’t dim down.

34:53.936 --> 34:59.476
It will be absolutely in relation to what you can understand.

34:59.634 --> 35:03.653
Sometimes the deities emit too much of vibrations in pujas, I have seen.

35:03.773 --> 35:08.325
But if you cannot bear it they don’t enter into you.

35:08.445 --> 35:11.465
They trouble Me but they won’t enter into you.

35:11.585 --> 35:15.449
So one must understand that what is important is not

35:15.569 --> 35:18.679
what you know about this and know about that, and know about that

35:18.800 --> 35:20.091
- is not so important.

35:20.212 --> 35:23.587
What is important is what stage you have reached.

35:23.708 --> 35:27.520
At what maturity you are in Sahaja Yoga.

35:27.703 --> 35:31.482
Now there are so many qualities of Shri Ganesha as I told you

35:31.602 --> 35:35.798
which I think there is no time
today to talk about it.

35:35.919 --> 35:39.064
But gradually I have been talking about all His qualities

35:39.184 --> 35:43.973
and all of them can be expressed and manifested in your being

35:44.094 --> 35:50.519
if you are really respecting Him, absolutely.

35:50.544 --> 35:54.942
That's the only way one can manifest His qualities.

35:55.125 --> 35:56.188
May God bless you.
