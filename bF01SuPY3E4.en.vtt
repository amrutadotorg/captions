00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:02.230
I talk to you about the right side.

00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:17.150
Right side sympathetic nervous system which
is expressed by other subtle energy of Mahasaraswati

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:37.400
which gives us the power to act - by left
side we desire and by using the right side,

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:43.720
the power of pingala nadi, we act.

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.840
I was telling you about the right side the
other day.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.300
Let us see how our right side is built up.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:00.590
I’m sorry for people who have come for the
first time but every time when I start the

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:06.580
introduction to the subject, again it becomes
the same but later on I’ll explain to you

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.080
about Sahaja.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:26.659
Now this right side pingala nadi is a very,
very important energy-giving energy

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:30.150
which makes us act and activate.

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:38.210
Now this one is made of all the five elements.

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:46.070
You know all the five elements that have created
our physical being and our mental being.

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:57.060
That’s how it helps us to work out all our
physical and mental problems, mental activities

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.070
and mental and physical growth.

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:14.680
Now this being made by those five elements,
when first time human beings started thinking

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:27.859
of doing some action about anything, say in
India, they first thought why not somehow

00:02:27.859 --> 00:02:37.760
or other reach to the principle of these elements,
which is beyond physics, which is beyond chemistry.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:51.931
And to reach to that point, they thought it
would be better if we try to invoke or to

00:02:51.931 --> 00:02:59.319
awaken the Deities which are governing those
five elements.

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:04.180
This was a very big mistake though, I should
say.

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:11.839
Because human beings, whatever they take up,
they do not know where to stop.

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:20.569
If you tell them that you have to clean your
teeth everyday, then they’ll go on cleaning

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:23.879
it 12 times in 12 hours.

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:31.939
You tell them anything, they’ll go so far
that they will destroy the instrument which

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:33.729
is suppose to be looked after.

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:39.720
That’s the nature of human beings, they
cannot have brakes to themselves.

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:46.720
They do not have common sense as far as balance
in their life.

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:59.290
So anything you give them, they become so
mad after it that in Marathi there is a word

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:04.369
is that they ultimately put ashes on their
head, to say to declare that I am dead now,

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:05.390
I’ve become ashes.

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:14.680
Like that, they get so frantic that even while
doing this awakening of these principles,

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:21.319
they forgot, lost their sight that we are
after all spirit and not these elements.

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:23.180
We are beyond that.

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.090
You have to reach beyond that.

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:34.419
All these elements are only useful for us
to achieve a state in which we can create

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:46.330
things and we can have more time to devote
to meditation to enjoy our self-realisation.

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:57.270
They got completely blinded by the advances
they made on this side which is in pure and

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.849
simple words is materialism.

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:06.229
They became so responsible, so efficient.

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:15.490
First in the Vedas, it’s written, the first
stanza is such that by reading these Vedas,

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:22.849
if you do not know your spirit then it is
absolutely useless.

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:26.680
But this stanza they always close down I think.

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:32.650
Then they started worshipping those Deities,
this, that, exciting them, doing all ritualism,

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:37.290
and all that and they just went into it headlong,
absolutely headlong.

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:39.510
They would not turn back.

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:47.949
So by exciting these elements, they discovered
the principles of these elements.

00:05:47.949 --> 00:05:53.890
For example, they discovered that gravity
is the essence of the Mother Earth.

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:57.469
But it is not.

00:05:57.469 --> 00:05:59.830
That is not the essence of the Mother Earth.

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:06.990
That is the energy that is asserted by Her
but Her essence is Her fragrance.

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:15.659
They could not cross that limit where they
could see really the subtle thing which was

00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:19.930
the subtle principle of this energy of gravity
is the fragrance.

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:28.419
All the fragrances come from Her.

00:06:28.419 --> 00:06:31.830
Of course man made there are, that’s different.

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:37.199
But even the man made, are also coming from
Her, if you go trace the source, it’s up

00:06:37.199 --> 00:06:39.949
to the point, it is from there.

00:06:39.949 --> 00:06:48.310
Like that they went on discovering the subtler,
so called subtler energies or the principles

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:53.300
of these elements from the Vedas style.

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:55.900
Then it became a science.

00:06:55.900 --> 00:07:02.139
People started studying physics, chemistry,
this, that, understanding what was there before

00:07:02.139 --> 00:07:07.610
them, by going into it and trying to find
out what is it made of.

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:16.749
For example, they went into atoms, they went
into say molecules and things and they tried

00:07:16.749 --> 00:07:26.810
to find out and there they find the oscillation
of the protons and they find the oscillation

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:29.210
of these atoms.

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:35.610
And they just can’t understand, from where
does this energy of this oscillation is coming.

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:43.509
They could not capture that energy so they
thought better use the energy, so they started

00:07:43.509 --> 00:07:45.729
using the energy.

00:07:45.729 --> 00:07:51.120
Now it has gone to such a limit of the whole
thing is, now I read, saw that microchips

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:52.689
or something coming up.

00:07:52.689 --> 00:08:00.129
After some time you won’t be using hands
or head or anything, it will be that microchips

00:08:00.129 --> 00:08:01.330
will be going on.

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:05.930
But with this kind of a thing, with this extreme
behaviour, you’ll become a machine yourself.

00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:08.340
A slave of the machine.

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:13.629
Today the petrol is exhausted, tomorrow electricity
is exhausted, then what are you going to do?

00:08:13.629 --> 00:08:17.080
You don’t know even to count two plus two.

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:22.770
So you are left without any counting, you’ll
become the same primitive man and I don’t

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:29.590
know what you will be doing, climbing on the
trees and living like monkeys, I don’t know

00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:31.249
what will happen.

00:08:31.249 --> 00:08:36.409
So all these advancement that you did has
gone too far.

00:08:36.409 --> 00:08:43.529
But as a result of too much efficiency, too
much responsibility and all that, you became

00:08:43.529 --> 00:08:49.860
sort of addicted to it and then with that
you started dominating other people.

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:55.541
The machinery came in, that you produced such
a lot of machinery style that you didn’t

00:08:55.541 --> 00:09:00.570
know what to do so you had to find out markets
where you sell them so you started capturing

00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:04.970
other markets where you started selling them
and that’s how all these economic problems

00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:06.350
and all this have started.

00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:10.540
There are developing countries, there are
developed countries, all things going on in

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:12.060
this mad world.

00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:19.620
But we reach a point now where we realise
that this machine has done something nonsensical

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:20.620
within us.

00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:25.910
When we reach that point, we start thinking
now what are we to do.

00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:33.769
We have been very responsible, not you people
but your forefathers may be, who went to fight

00:09:33.769 --> 00:09:39.860
the whole world and do this and they had to
be at right time at right places and do all

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:41.209
sorts of things.

00:09:41.209 --> 00:09:47.580
By that over-responsibility you became sort
of fed up, you just didn’t know what to

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:48.580
do.

00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:50.770
For example, morning you wear a grey suit,
in the night you have to wear a tail coat

00:09:50.770 --> 00:09:57.100
and then if you have to drink your wine, you
have to take a separate glass and for that

00:09:57.100 --> 00:09:58.100
this.

00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:03.290
It became too much messy you said “Throw
them in the sea”.

00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:10.709
We have collected all this nonsense, we have
collected all these forms and horrible things

00:10:10.709 --> 00:10:12.750
that have made us so rigid.

00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:16.899
That’s how you try to throw away everything
but even then when you throw away, where do

00:10:16.899 --> 00:10:17.899
you go?

00:10:17.899 --> 00:10:19.750
I mean you have to exist, you cannot just
hang in the air.

00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:21.890
So you said now take another style.

00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:26.260
And another style is even worse, much worse.

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:35.590
Because then no responsibility, no respect,
no understanding, so this power goes absolutely

00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:36.590
zero.

00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:39.899
You are tired very soon.

00:10:39.899 --> 00:10:46.880
I’ve seen, I mean in the BBC and all that,
young people, I’m a very old woman compared

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:50.730
to them, after saying two three words, they
say “Ahhh”, they go down.

00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:52.209
Again after saying something, “Ahhh”.

00:10:52.209 --> 00:10:54.279
This is very big acting these days.

00:10:54.279 --> 00:10:57.630
In any play you see a person saying, “Ahhh”.

00:10:57.630 --> 00:11:04.170
What does it take to act for this kind of
a thing.

00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:06.540
This is what is very common.

00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:09.209
Now you notice, the reason is you are tired.

00:11:09.209 --> 00:11:11.380
You’re absolutely tired, why?

00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:23.320
Because your brain is the same old brain and
you have taken a new life, you cannot adjust

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:24.730
yourself to that.

00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:29.290
You say that now I am sitting down, doing
nothing, I am not going to be efficient anymore

00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:33.880
and all that, I’m sitting down, the brain
is going, chug-chug-chug-chug-chug, morning

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:34.880
till evening.

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:36.120
How to stop this brain?

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:41.370
This brain is working so hard, using up all
your energy, you have no strength.

00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:48.139
So to counteract you will say let’s take
to some sort of a thing by which we go out

00:11:48.139 --> 00:11:49.389
of this madness.

00:11:49.389 --> 00:11:56.269
Let’s take to something that takes you as
we call it the right or the left side, take

00:11:56.269 --> 00:12:03.630
something like say hashish, or something like
another thing, LSD, to go to the right or

00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:04.690
to the left.

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:08.910
Now what happens with that you know very well.

00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:15.070
Now thank God you have realised also to that
was nonsensical action, that was wrong.

00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:20.160
These are two areas within us which are called
as Adi Bhautik and Adi Devik.

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:28.790
Now the Adi Bhautik are the ones which take
you to the left side is the subconscious and

00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:34.680
the Adi Devik are the ones where you try to
invoke the devas and all that on the right

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:42.269
hand side, that one is the Adi Devik where
we call it supra-conscious area.

00:12:42.269 --> 00:12:47.230
These two are of no use to human beings, actually.

00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:49.750
They are not meant for human beings.

00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:57.050
They are meant for people who are dead, who
are dead souls, who are good for nothing.

00:12:57.050 --> 00:12:58.720
Now they cannot get realisation.

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:00.910
It’s not meant for you.

00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:04.209
That’s the area you should not reside.

00:13:04.209 --> 00:13:08.110
But you enter into these areas because of
extreme natures.

00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:14.100
Some people by going into these drugs, some
taking to some sort of movements like mesmerisms,

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:16.740
spiritualisms and all sorts of isms.

00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:24.990
Some people onto the right hand side like
taking to what you call these people who are

00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:30.090
racialists and all such organisations which
are racialist and this and that and you know

00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:33.000
all that kind of a people, like Hitlerish
type.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:38.410
All this is nothing but is a kind of intoxicant
which makes you forget the reality, that you

00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:46.339
are a human being, that you have to become
the spirit, that you are the spirit is the

00:13:46.339 --> 00:13:47.339
reality.

00:13:47.339 --> 00:13:55.990
Now the present trend in the Western life
is very much set in this country about which

00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:57.700
I am very much concerned.

00:13:57.700 --> 00:14:04.250
I’ve talked about to many people in person
and also the vibes (?), that the quality of

00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:09.870
the mind, because we are with the English,
let’s talk about the English.

00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:14.610
Quality of mind of English is excellent, I’ve
said it always.

00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:19.470
And the young people of English have a very
good quality of mind.

00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:22.709
But their heart is lacking.

00:14:22.709 --> 00:14:25.259
They’re frightened of what God alone knows
but they are frightened.

00:14:25.259 --> 00:14:26.800
Why they have taken this course, I don’t
know.

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:30.450
Now to do any work, also they’re frightened.

00:14:30.450 --> 00:14:36.269
Supposing we put this colour, then it may
not match, it doesn’t matter, doesn’t

00:14:36.269 --> 00:14:37.269
matter.

00:14:37.269 --> 00:14:38.329
What does it matter?

00:14:38.329 --> 00:14:43.620
Because of those previous ideas they are so
frightened of doing anything, though they

00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:51.660
say they have broken all those ideas and they
have taken to new liberated ways and all that.

00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:57.110
But this liberation is also another madness
in which they’re fear has now gone.

00:14:57.110 --> 00:15:05.819
So the quality of mind of we the English sahaja
yogis and English people is excellent.

00:15:05.819 --> 00:15:11.220
If you talk to them, you’ll think you are
talking to a scholar, I mean no less than

00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:12.220
Shakespeare.

00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:17.000
They could be very well read, they will know
about anything you ask them, what is this

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.000
road?

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.000
This is the road!

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.160
Now, what is the name of this road?

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:22.160
This is the gentleman.

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:24.160
Who was his grandfather, what he did, what
was the gossip about him, scandals, everything.

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:30.910
You can get everything from them, they know
everything about everything.

00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:37.529
Sometimes I’m amazed the way people know
about things.

00:15:37.529 --> 00:15:41.730
About all the details as to how many women
he had, and how many wives he divorced and

00:15:41.730 --> 00:15:44.279
what he did and where he went and what he
wrote.

00:15:44.279 --> 00:15:51.100
Take anyone, take a writer, or take an artist,
or take a hooligan, or take a robber or anyone

00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:57.160
who has appeared on the newspaper as if they
have drunk all the newspaper into their memory.

00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:04.040
The whole thing is so clear cut in their mind
that is sometimes, I mean.

00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:13.970
But if you tell them to fix one chair, never
trust that chair (everyone laughing).

00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:14.970
Never trust it.

00:16:14.970 --> 00:16:20.829
If you ask them to do anything, they’ll
tell you: ‘Alright, tomorrow at 7 sharp,

00:16:20.829 --> 00:16:22.319
I’ll be there.’

00:16:22.319 --> 00:16:27.279
Even if he comes after 7 days, thank your
stars.

00:16:27.279 --> 00:16:31.569
I’ve known people who have been done this
to me.

00:16:31.569 --> 00:16:35.899
Now it’s 4 years, I’ve never seen their
faces again.

00:16:35.899 --> 00:16:43.510
They’re supposed to be XYZ from Oxford and
ABCD from Cambridge.

00:16:43.510 --> 00:16:46.500
They have got first class first and this and
that.

00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:50.430
If you go into their rooms, you will find
it’s a pig sty.

00:16:50.430 --> 00:16:53.690
You don’t know where you have landed.

00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:56.589
I mean, you don’t believe that it belongs
to any educated person, there’s no sense

00:16:56.589 --> 00:16:57.879
of responsibility left in their head.

00:16:57.879 --> 00:17:05.210
I mean this energy that is working in the
head, if it is not put into a responsible

00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:10.970
channel, no wonder, we find every third person
is a paranoid, something wrong with the brain.

00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:17.320
What is wrong with the brain is that so much
energy is here and you are not channelizing

00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:18.530
it at all.

00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:22.300
By what ways are we to channelize it.

00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:29.580
Even after realisation, I find people have
no respect for anything.

00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:34.850
Sometimes it’s most surprising that with
all this brain activity going on, they get

00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:36.440
all the satisfaction from the spirit.

00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:43.840
They’re raising the Kundalini and all that
but they have lost that capacity to be responsible

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:50.250
and that’s why in Sahaja Yoga also they
are not responsible.

00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:55.830
This goes on not only about their own private
work but about Sahaja Yoga about everything.

00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:58.170
So this quality of mind has no heart.

00:17:58.170 --> 00:17:59.830
It has no, it has heart in nothing.

00:17:59.830 --> 00:18:06.610
Supposing I am telling you something, I don’t
know about sahaja yogis as such, but now…

00:18:06.610 --> 00:18:13.020
I’ve seen with people, you give them a lecture
for one year, one hour, it’s lost, finished.

00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:15.370
They’re just the same, what has happened.

00:18:15.370 --> 00:18:20.280
It’s only the vibrations, it’s only how
you work it out that the life changes and

00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:21.280
all that.

00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:24.640
But as far as they are concerned, nothing
is recorded in the memory.

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:27.710
Sometimes I feel how do I talk?

00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:30.720
Is it too much on their heads or below their
feet?

00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:32.770
Where is it flowing?

00:18:32.770 --> 00:18:37.380
So the reason is that the heart is lost.

00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:42.920
If you register it through your heart, you
will do it.

00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:45.320
If you put your heart into things you will
do it.

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:53.710
The heart is as I told you is chicken-hearted,
is absolutely chicken-hearted.

00:18:53.710 --> 00:18:56.870
And that’s why, this is what is lacking
in our character.

00:18:56.870 --> 00:19:04.040
For that now the stage has reached, we have
to raise our right side, not the left side.

00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:13.350
Our right side is absolutely finished and
there the leader of the right side are two

00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:14.350
persons.

00:19:14.350 --> 00:19:15.350
The Deities are two persons.

00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:19.541
Of course Brahmadeva is the one who is the
creator, who has created this universe and

00:19:19.541 --> 00:19:25.200
who is the one who is busy still creating
and doing lots of things for you people.

00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:34.680
But I would suggest that we have to pay attention
to two ideals we have in the history.

00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:40.380
For this to understand what sort of ideals
we should have, because the right side is

00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:45.800
a Rajo Guna is the one by which you become
majestic, you become royal, you achieve all

00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:47.320
the Rajo Guna as you know that.

00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:51.430
Now two persons are really to be followed
on there.

00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:55.130
One of them is Shri Ram.

00:19:55.130 --> 00:20:03.100
Shri Ram resides on the right heart and is
the father.

00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:07.400
He is the father and He is the fatherhood.

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:13.510
He is the one who came on this earth to teach
us how to be a father as a king.

00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:14.670
He is a father king.

00:20:14.670 --> 00:20:21.390
He is a benevolent king, which was described
before [??] He is the benevolent.

00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:29.690
He was the ideal that came on this earth to
teach us how to be responsible to others,

00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:36.240
how to respect others, how to understand the
feelings of others.

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:48.790
To such an extent He went that He had to sacrifice
His own wife for the sake of His own state.

00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:57.250
He did that and He had to ask His wife who
was pregnant to go and live with a very great

00:20:57.250 --> 00:20:58.250
sage.

00:20:58.250 --> 00:21:02.500
One may say that what was He doing about His
wife.

00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:03.960
She was the Goddess.

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:09.840
She was so remarkable that He was not bothered
about Her.

00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:15.660
He was so sure of Her powers that He did it
and there is nothing wrong in leaving things

00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:21.490
to the Goddess to do instead of meddling with
Her all the time.

00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:30.810
But this gentleman Shri Rama, understood the
responsibility of a king and that responsibility

00:21:30.810 --> 00:21:32.740
is lacking in us.

00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:35.820
That responsibility towards ourselves and
towards others.

00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:38.380
It is very, very surprising.

00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:41.850
I mean I came from India.

00:21:41.850 --> 00:21:48.570
I’d never met Englishmen at this close quarters
till I came to England I should say.

00:21:48.570 --> 00:21:50.780
Because before that we met all missionaries.

00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:55.360
All missionaries were terribly responsible
for converting all the people into Christianity.

00:21:55.360 --> 00:22:00.770
They will get up early in the morning, take
their Bible, go around to all the places,

00:22:00.770 --> 00:22:06.110
cleaning all the dirty lanes and cleaning
all the children like bits of paper see, cleaning

00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:10.910
all the dirty people there, kiss them and
do all impressive things to convert the people.

00:22:10.910 --> 00:22:15.560
They would go even to the forest to convert.

00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:22.530
They were so responsible about it that they
felt they have to do it, this is God’s job,

00:22:22.530 --> 00:22:28.590
they’re doing God’s job, they must convert,
and they went on with this and that’s how

00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:30.430
some of the people I met.

00:22:30.430 --> 00:22:32.620
Then the rulers, the rulers are extremely
responsible.

00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:34.540
They were ruthless and they thought this was
the greatest thing they are doing to spread

00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:36.120
British Raj and that was their responsibility.

00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:41.190
When it comes to spreading God’s Raj you
are not.

00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:46.170
First of all in our own life, we should see
are we responsible.

00:22:46.170 --> 00:22:52.890
Now in the modern times I find that we have
got rid of that sense of responsibility, it’s

00:22:52.890 --> 00:22:55.860
called as a sense of diminishing responsibility.

00:22:55.860 --> 00:23:03.720
You’ll just say yes, yes, I know, I should
have, I know, I know.

00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:05.030
I can’t understand.

00:23:05.030 --> 00:23:10.700
If you have a heart, how can you say that,
that I know I should not have done.

00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:11.700
I know, I should have been doing.

00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:17.040
The reason is there is no heart and the heart
always catches when your right side over acts.

00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:20.510
That means your brain is active too much and
there is no real action the outward of it.

00:23:20.510 --> 00:23:27.320
You think too much and do not put it to practice.

00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:33.780
I should have gone, I should have done this,
I should have said so, and this is the problem

00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:35.390
with our right side.

00:23:35.390 --> 00:23:42.270
Now, among our sahaja yogis also, I find people
have the problem of the right side.

00:23:42.270 --> 00:23:50.630
To worship the right side, we have to see
to Shri Ram.

00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:52.860
How He felt responsible for the whole world.

00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:55.680
How He use to look after people.

00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:59.560
How He looked after the things of other people.

00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:03.420
How He behaved towards other people, that’s
a very important thing which we have to learn.

00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:05.360
But I find people coming, if it is somebody
else’s, they’ll throw.

00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:11.670
They will just jump into something and say
that alright, this is my house I just settle

00:24:11.670 --> 00:24:13.410
down here, the way I like.

00:24:13.410 --> 00:24:17.580
There’s no sense of responsibility at all
about it, that you have come to somebody else’s

00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:18.580
house.

00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:20.230
You have to have some care about it.

00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:26.520
In the same way you have to know you have
come in the world of God.

00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:29.450
This is the Kingdom of God where you have
entered.

00:24:29.450 --> 00:24:30.780
You have been a stranger.

00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:35.080
Today you are a guest in His house, what are
you doing about it.

00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:37.140
How are you behaving?

00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:38.970
Are you responsible?

00:24:38.970 --> 00:24:45.750
Are you like Shri Rama who took it up Himself,
all the problems of the world and still He

00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:46.800
was so responsible.

00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:52.100
He would not do anything even this much to
disturb a person.

00:24:52.100 --> 00:25:01.270
As far as possible He would like to try to
console, and have the formalities of good

00:25:01.270 --> 00:25:02.270
living.

00:25:02.270 --> 00:25:05.160
Formality is meant for good living and good
understanding.

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:09.010
Unless and until you have this sense of responsibility,
your collectivity cannot be alright.

00:25:09.010 --> 00:25:12.330
You cannot be collectively alright.

00:25:12.330 --> 00:25:14.930
You need not be a machine for that.

00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:21.270
There is no need to be a machine, like Japanese,
only one person says another doesn’t come.

00:25:21.270 --> 00:25:27.630
But this one kind of a funny individualism
that you have got will never give you that

00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:32.000
collectivity that is expected of Sahaja Yoga.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:37.940
We all have to be one, being responsible for
each other.

00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:41.540
Not only for one or two persons, because he
is my friend, he is my husband, she is my

00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:43.290
wife but for all of us.

00:25:43.290 --> 00:25:49.440
We have to be responsible for their things,
for their children, for their house, for everything.

00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:51.250
We have to be responsible.

00:25:51.250 --> 00:25:58.010
And if this sense of responsibility is lacking,
how will you have responsibility for your

00:25:58.010 --> 00:25:59.010
self-realisation.

00:25:59.010 --> 00:26:04.580
Only it can be a self-centred thing, thinking
that I’m very much better, my powers are

00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:07.270
better, I must have more powers.

00:26:07.270 --> 00:26:14.630
But if you do not have this sense of responsibility
why should God also give you powers.

00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:22.470
The main thing is your right side is completely
weak, that is the surya nadi, that is the

00:26:22.470 --> 00:26:27.340
nadi which is called as the nadi by which
people hold their prana, so it gives you the

00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:28.340
prana shakti.

00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:36.710
It’s the prana shakti within you which is
the vital force of energy within you, which

00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:37.750
is lacking.

00:26:37.750 --> 00:26:44.380
Now this lacking is added up by your heart,
at least for a man like that whose prana shakti

00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:45.530
is exhausted.

00:26:45.530 --> 00:26:52.350
At least for such a man if the heart is there,
he can really use that power which is accumulating

00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:58.040
in the head and exhausting him, like eating
up his brain.

00:26:58.040 --> 00:26:59.950
If he has the heart in it.

00:26:59.950 --> 00:27:06.420
Now this is what I have told you last time
that the right side of human beings is very

00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:14.210
important when it comes to Sahaja Yoga because
when the Kundalini rises, your right side

00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:16.940
is also, right side is also awakened.

00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:22.620
Now the question is why Sahaja Yoga does not
spread in England so far.

00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:24.860
This is a very good question.

00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:26.710
Many people have asked it.

00:27:26.710 --> 00:27:29.300
While in Australia it’s spread so fast.

00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:33.410
The reason is the right side is missing.

00:27:33.410 --> 00:27:36.220
The right side to be awakened, first of all
there should be some right side.

00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:38.400
If there is no right side, what do you awaken?

00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:43.010
If there is no light at all, what are you
going to awaken?

00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:46.740
There has to be a lamp to be awakened.

00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:53.540
So all these topics and talks that we have
in the society: ,I know, I know’, and then

00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:57.940
you ask them this and they say: ‘I don’t’
[?]. How are you, like.

00:27:57.940 --> 00:28:01.750
[?] All these accents and all that, one should
give up.

00:28:01.750 --> 00:28:04.350
One should know that you have to be responsible.

00:28:04.350 --> 00:28:08.950
That’s a very, very important thing of life.

00:28:08.950 --> 00:28:14.570
I personally think unless and until you feel
that responsibility, that heart into Sahaja

00:28:14.570 --> 00:28:18.550
Yoga you will enjoy just by talk as you would
just enjoy anything else.

00:28:18.550 --> 00:28:23.230
Real enjoyment comes when your spirit really
blows out the vibrations.

00:28:23.230 --> 00:28:28.330
You are taking my vibrations alright, you
are feeling them.

00:28:28.330 --> 00:28:30.740
But what about yours?

00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:35.930
Are you blowing your vibrations out or they
are just eating your brain.

00:28:35.930 --> 00:28:40.210
Simple questions, are you blowing any vibrations
outside?

00:28:40.210 --> 00:28:47.360
We have some sahaja yogis when they just enter
into a house, immediately, everyone feels

00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:48.360
it.

00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:51.760
Everyone can feel it that somebody has come.

00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:56.250
Immediately, the whole thing cools down in
no time, somebody has come.

00:28:56.250 --> 00:28:59.040
There are some here also, not that there are
none.

00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:01.000
But they’re few.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.880
You have to blow out vibrations, otherwise
you are just a liability to yourself.

00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:06.630
Why don’t you blow out vibrations, because
you don’t feel responsible.

00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:15.230
In your day to day life, morning till evening,
you have to see that you develop this instrument

00:29:15.230 --> 00:29:18.100
of responsibility within you.

00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:24.340
Otherwise the vibrations won’t flow because
the main reason is that our nervous system

00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:29.370
comes to us through our right side.

00:29:29.370 --> 00:29:35.980
Our nervous system is built up by our right
side.

00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:39.150
All the elements within us have built up.

00:29:39.150 --> 00:29:44.020
If the elements are weakened, if the chakras
which are made by these elements, as you know

00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:48.760
all these charkas are made by elements, if
the part is weak, nothing is going to work

00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:49.760
out.

00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:59.070
You should be able to hold that water of love
or you can say the water of bliss and should

00:29:59.070 --> 00:30:04.280
be able to pour it out to others.

00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:10.350
Unless and until you are able to do that,
Sahaja Yoga won’t spread.

00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:12.750
It will spread very slowly.

00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:17.120
This is the difference I feel between English
and Australians.

00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:19.980
That the quality of mind is thousands times
better than Australians.

00:30:19.980 --> 00:30:21.450
They are not scholars.

00:30:21.450 --> 00:30:24.410
I found very few people there who are even
graduates.

00:30:24.410 --> 00:30:26.530
Here everybody is a PhD or may be a MAD.

00:30:26.530 --> 00:30:29.670
But they are all very well educated.

00:30:29.670 --> 00:30:35.900
Despite all that, Sahaja Yoga does not spread
out, why?

00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:40.670
The reason is the quality of mind is good,
but the action is extremely poor because they’re

00:30:40.670 --> 00:30:43.760
exhausted, tired, you are fighting in the
mind.

00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:44.860
You are not doing anything by which you blow
it out.

00:30:44.860 --> 00:30:54.480
The right side is what you call the Brahmas,
the Brahmadeva’s creation and the Brahma

00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:56.940
Shakti as they call it.

00:30:56.940 --> 00:31:02.940
This is the power of Brahma which is flowing
through you.

00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:08.750
We call it the power of the spirit, it’s
true.

00:31:08.750 --> 00:31:13.260
But the spirit, the power of the spirit flows
on your central nervous system.

00:31:13.260 --> 00:31:21.020
If there is the electricity all stored up
here and there are very weak wires, what can

00:31:21.020 --> 00:31:24.970
you do with all that stored up energy.

00:31:24.970 --> 00:31:33.140
The wires have to be improved and for this
wire your right side has to be improved immensely.

00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:37.980
Every minute you have to be responsible and
this is what is lacking.

00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:42.970
Then I find when … for [incomrehensible]
responsible, they feel extremely hurt.

00:31:42.970 --> 00:31:47.620
They feel that they should really shout and
scream and should do something.

00:31:47.620 --> 00:31:52.340
They don’t know that these are really the
saints, they are realised souls.

00:31:52.340 --> 00:31:54.230
They are great people, no doubt.

00:31:54.230 --> 00:31:58.230
But their right side is weakened.

00:31:58.230 --> 00:32:04.990
But that is not a great thing to accept, it
is a very bad thing.

00:32:04.990 --> 00:32:07.430
But that does not mean you should feel guilty
again, I am saying.

00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:09.640
Because very nice, this is the way you manage
is to feel guilty.

00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:12.030
Because feeling guilty is the best way, ‘I’m
sorry, I’m sorry.

00:32:12.030 --> 00:32:13.030
I should have done it.

00:32:13.030 --> 00:32:16.610
I know, I know’ – finished!

00:32:16.610 --> 00:32:17.630
Then how can you improve?

00:32:17.630 --> 00:32:22.720
If you are about fear filled up all the time
with responsibility denied, all the junk you

00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:30.090
have created out of that, you are pushing
into that pouch and then you say: ‘Yes,

00:32:30.090 --> 00:32:32.940
yes, I know, I should not have done that!’

00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:35.911
Now what can you do?

00:32:35.911 --> 00:32:39.630
As I mother you can’t say ‘you’ll hang
yourself by the nearest tree’.

00:32:39.630 --> 00:32:41.260
What do I do?

00:32:41.260 --> 00:32:43.020
I’m just look at you flabbergasted.

00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:44.020
I said: ‘Really?’

00:32:44.020 --> 00:32:45.020
‘Yes, I should have done but I haven’t
done it.’

00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:46.930
For example, I should tell somebody you better
cook for 10 people, they are coming and the

00:32:46.930 --> 00:32:53.340
person says: ‘No, I’m sorry, I forgot,
I didn’t cook.’

00:32:53.340 --> 00:32:54.500
You are doomed.

00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:55.500
You cannot hit him with the back can you?

00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:56.500
What to do.

00:32:56.500 --> 00:32:57.500
That’s how you are at a standstill.

00:32:57.500 --> 00:32:58.500
You really don’t know how to deal.

00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:03.610
The point is in all this talking of spirit
and God, one has to know the vehicle has to

00:33:03.610 --> 00:33:04.610
be better.

00:33:04.610 --> 00:33:08.430
The vehicle is so very poor that it cannot
carry, otherwise you will emit vibrations

00:33:08.430 --> 00:33:09.430
like that.

00:33:09.430 --> 00:33:10.430
I know you can.

00:33:10.430 --> 00:33:11.480
Wherever you stand you’ll attract.

00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:12.610
People must gather round.

00:33:12.610 --> 00:33:19.070
You’ll be amazed, I went to Australia for
how many months, at the most a month or so.

00:33:19.070 --> 00:33:26.460
I came back from there, already seven centres
have started and every centre has got at least

00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:33.910
300 regular people coming.

00:33:33.910 --> 00:33:37.990
It is not to feel guilty.

00:33:37.990 --> 00:33:43.130
I’m not saying, but to awaken yourself.

00:33:43.130 --> 00:33:45.372
To arise to this point.

00:33:45.372 --> 00:33:51.762
To be elated with understanding that you have
to rise up to that point and that you have

00:33:51.762 --> 00:33:55.130
to take up that position because you are the
warriors of truth.

00:33:55.130 --> 00:33:59.520
You are the people who are seekers who have
been for ages and you have no business to

00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:00.520
be irresponsible.

00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:04.230
You have to do it.

00:34:04.230 --> 00:34:10.100
It is my earnest desire that you understand
what I am saying.

00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:14.990
Just sitting, meditating, putting hands towards
me or towards the photograph is not everything.

00:34:14.990 --> 00:34:16.119
You are still receiving.

00:34:16.119 --> 00:34:18.879
You are still at the receiving end.

00:34:18.879 --> 00:34:21.049
You have to be on the giving end.

00:34:21.049 --> 00:34:22.339
How will you do it?

00:34:22.339 --> 00:34:27.250
You get so many vibrations sometimes that
you cannot feel after some time, it’s so

00:34:27.250 --> 00:34:28.250
filled the pitcher is so much filled.

00:34:28.250 --> 00:34:29.250
But what about pouring it out?

00:34:29.250 --> 00:34:30.460
Why you cannot pour it out?

00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:39.639
The reason is that the vehicle within you,
which is the right side, is the pingala nadi,

00:34:39.639 --> 00:34:42.700
is out of gear.

00:34:42.700 --> 00:34:44.510
And this is what one has to understand.

00:34:44.510 --> 00:34:50.790
That can be built up only when you know about
Shri Rama’s life, the way He led His life.

00:34:50.790 --> 00:34:53.389
Every minute of His life was dynamic.

00:34:53.389 --> 00:34:59.230
Not a single minute He wasted in life.

00:34:59.230 --> 00:35:05.259
Every minute, whether He was in the forest
or He went to a place with His wife when He

00:35:05.259 --> 00:35:13.130
was in exile, and there He knew His wife was
a very shy lady and She would not take Her

00:35:13.130 --> 00:35:16.140
bath in the open.

00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:18.490
So there’s a rock which is completely holed
out.

00:35:18.490 --> 00:35:23.540
Such a big rock, holed out can you imagine.

00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:26.799
Inside there is a water.

00:35:26.799 --> 00:35:29.710
Water taps sort of a thing coming out, there’s
a water coming out.

00:35:29.710 --> 00:35:36.549
So that there’s stone here, stone here,
stone there, and at the end of it there’s

00:35:36.549 --> 00:35:40.299
an opening so that there’s light coming
from this side, light coming from that side

00:35:40.299 --> 00:35:42.450
but inside nobody can see.

00:35:42.450 --> 00:35:43.730
There are trees.

00:35:43.730 --> 00:35:49.359
There are trees like which are called as chikakaye
[??] means that its kind of a soap giving

00:35:49.359 --> 00:35:52.559
tree are created by Him for His wife.

00:35:52.559 --> 00:36:01.030
Anywhere He lived He created a new dimension,
a new house, a new style of life.

00:36:01.030 --> 00:36:03.510
Of course He was an incarnation you can say.

00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:10.880
But He’s your ideal and not those people
who sit out for hours together drinking something

00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:14.599
and thinking they are great martials.

00:36:14.599 --> 00:36:19.109
I see all of them sitting here at a church
here and one of them was asked by someone

00:36:19.109 --> 00:36:21.700
who was passing: ‘What are you doing?’

00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:22.750
‘We killing ourselves!’

00:36:22.750 --> 00:36:24.500
Very proudly to say that.

00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:29.390
I mean I just don’t understand, what business
have they got to kill themselves.

00:36:29.390 --> 00:36:33.710
How much time it has taken God to create them
and here they are sitting and proudly telling

00:36:33.710 --> 00:36:35.500
that we are killing ourselves.

00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:41.460
This is the situation in which I suddenly
find myself.

00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:44.440
So I ask you what should I do?

00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:45.810
How should I do?

00:36:45.810 --> 00:36:50.440
You have to feel responsible in every way
of life.

00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:58.070
But you do not think that there is anything
wrong if you are a hanky panky person.

00:36:58.070 --> 00:37:01.650
If your feathers are falling everywhere, it’s
alright.

00:37:01.650 --> 00:37:04.529
To you it really does not matter.

00:37:04.529 --> 00:37:07.160
But to the Divine it does.

00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:15.950
That means a person cannot convey the message
of God, cannot emit it, the bliss of God,

00:37:15.950 --> 00:37:20.799
cannot pour that love.

00:37:20.799 --> 00:37:24.990
We have to become very responsible in every
day life.

00:37:24.990 --> 00:37:26.730
I’m not saying that in Sahaja Yoga but in
every day life, how you live, what you do.

00:37:26.730 --> 00:37:32.819
Are you only worried about yourself or you
are worried about others?

00:37:32.819 --> 00:37:34.710
Are you responsible for others?

00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:40.539
I mean the modern style is not even to wish
good morning, it’s regarded bad manners.

00:37:40.539 --> 00:37:47.270
You see it is bad manners even to open door
to someone, it is bad manners.

00:37:47.270 --> 00:37:48.570
They think it’s slavish.

00:37:48.570 --> 00:37:52.799
I mean, all manners, all those things, all
responsibility, seems to be slavish.

00:37:52.799 --> 00:37:58.863
And this kind of modern ideas that are floating
in the air, you should throw them away.

00:37:58.863 --> 00:38:00.869
You have to be human beings of a very great
quality.

00:38:00.869 --> 00:38:04.500
You have to be people who have created new
worlds.

00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:08.150
You are going to create that, I know.

00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:13.890
You have to just rise up to that point and
not to sink into your guilt’s and say: ‘Oh

00:38:13.890 --> 00:38:14.890
God, what have we been doing?’

00:38:14.890 --> 00:38:19.520
No, awake and arise and get it what you have
to do.

00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:24.559
That is what I feel about England.

00:38:24.559 --> 00:38:29.299
England is so great and is the heart, is the
heart.

00:38:29.299 --> 00:38:34.640
And look at the condition of the heart.

00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:37.799
Your heart is so weak.

00:38:37.799 --> 00:38:43.660
There’s no heart to anything.

00:38:43.660 --> 00:38:50.520
Alright you love Me, I love you, but what
about you loving others, and loving other

00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:51.520
things.

00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:54.529
Loving doesn’t mean writing love letters.

00:38:54.529 --> 00:38:58.780
Doing something about it.

00:38:58.780 --> 00:39:02.730
And that’s what, ‘the doing something’
is missing and lacking.

00:39:02.730 --> 00:39:08.570
And that’s what we have to build up our
right side properly, into proper shape.

00:39:08.570 --> 00:39:15.050
If we have to really do the cooking, we have
to know how to light the fire within us and

00:39:15.050 --> 00:39:18.819
not to sit down and worry how to do it.

00:39:18.819 --> 00:39:24.869
It is a very great thing to come to England
really.

00:39:24.869 --> 00:39:32.529
For one reason that this is the place where
Sahaja Yoga is going to work out.

00:39:32.529 --> 00:39:36.079
It is going to circulate in the whole world,
I know through you people.

00:39:36.079 --> 00:39:45.450
But if you do not improve the communication
wires of yours is become completely stagnant

00:39:45.450 --> 00:39:49.950
and the responsibility of this stagnation
will be on you the Sahaja Yogis of London,

00:39:49.950 --> 00:39:58.029
because you did not put your life together,
that’s why it did not work.

00:39:58.029 --> 00:40:00.640
It’s a tremendous responsibility.

00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:05.099
Of course to be responsible is wrong for wrong
things.

00:40:05.099 --> 00:40:13.380
But not to be responsible for Divine work
when God has blessed you with self-realisation,

00:40:13.380 --> 00:40:23.009
is absolutely against God, against yourself,
against Sahaja Yoga.

00:40:23.009 --> 00:40:27.890
The other personality which I was talking
about is Shri Hanumana.

00:40:27.890 --> 00:40:37.609
Shri Hanumana is such a great powerful personality
about whom I did not tell you.

00:40:37.609 --> 00:40:46.079
That, I mean, Rama once, you see His brother
was hit by an arrow.

00:40:46.079 --> 00:40:53.490
And Rama said to Hanumana, that: ‘Why don’t
you go and get a particular type of a medicine

00:40:53.490 --> 00:40:59.849
for him and you get it on a particular hill,
mountain, so you go and get that particular

00:40:59.849 --> 00:41:00.920
thing.’

00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:07.280
So He had a power, He had nine powers, navadha
shakti He had, nine powers, by which He could

00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:08.810
become small, He could become big.

00:41:08.810 --> 00:41:10.540
And He could lift anything.

00:41:10.540 --> 00:41:14.440
He had lots of powers like that, so nine powers:
anima (remark: reducing one’s physical self

00:41:14.440 --> 00:41:17.069
to the size of an atom), lagima (remark: lightness),
garima (remark: increase weight) - like that.

00:41:17.069 --> 00:41:19.230
He could become so heavy that nobody could
lift Him.

00:41:19.230 --> 00:41:23.930
I mean these are the powers He has got of
the right hand side.

00:41:23.930 --> 00:41:31.140
And so He went down to that mountain and He
couldn’t see that anywhere, He just couldn’t

00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:32.140
see.

00:41:32.140 --> 00:41:33.950
He said: ‘Why not take the whole mountain?’

00:41:33.950 --> 00:41:39.500
He took the whole mountain on Himself and
He brought it to Rama and said: ‘Now, select

00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:41.599
whichever one you like.’

00:41:41.599 --> 00:41:44.130
He could have come back and said: ‘Oh, I
can’t find!

00:41:44.130 --> 00:41:46.910
I’m sorry, I know, I’ve been useless.’

00:41:46.910 --> 00:41:49.980
If He was an Englishman.

00:41:49.980 --> 00:41:55.190
But He said: ‘Alright, if you want!’

00:41:55.190 --> 00:41:56.539
He brought the whole mountain, now come along
have it.

00:41:56.539 --> 00:42:05.359
In every way of His life, you see His sense
of responsibility and how He carries on.

00:42:05.359 --> 00:42:16.789
For example, He was sent to Ravana and He
was asked by Ravana that he told Him that

00:42:16.789 --> 00:42:19.550
you cannot stay in this place, why did you
come here.

00:42:19.550 --> 00:42:25.599
Actually, first He was, He went to Sita and
told Her that ‘Shri Rama had sent Me’

00:42:25.599 --> 00:42:31.619
and He showed the ring and She recognised
that was the ring of Her husband.

00:42:31.619 --> 00:42:34.269
And He said: ‘Mother if you want, I can
take you on my back.’

00:42:34.269 --> 00:42:35.269
But She said no.

00:42:35.269 --> 00:42:38.420
Already you see I am a woman who has come
with another man.

00:42:38.420 --> 00:42:42.710
You don’t want to have another bad name
and you’ll have a bad name, so I will not

00:42:42.710 --> 00:42:43.710
come.

00:42:43.710 --> 00:42:44.710
So it’s alright.

00:42:44.710 --> 00:42:48.710
You can go back and tell Rama that I am alright.

00:42:48.710 --> 00:42:52.059
‘You as a husband, come and fight this man.

00:42:52.059 --> 00:42:54.289
Otherwise I’m not going to come.’

00:42:54.289 --> 00:42:57.420
So then He was caught up and taken to Ravana.

00:42:57.420 --> 00:43:05.980
Now Ravana said that ‘you are a monkey and
what have you come to do it’.

00:43:05.980 --> 00:43:11.660
He said that ‘you better release His wife
of Shri Rama and He is such and such’.

00:43:11.660 --> 00:43:16.160
So He said ‘that you monkey, you are telling
me this’.

00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:18.010
Alright, he said: ‘Burn His tail.’

00:43:18.010 --> 00:43:21.289
He said: ‘If you burn my tail, I know how
to use.’

00:43:21.289 --> 00:43:24.759
He knows how the responsibility of the tail
is.

00:43:24.759 --> 00:43:31.520
He started burning the whole of Lanka with
His tail and He could have said that: ‘Alright

00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:37.500
he burnt my tail I better run away, why to
do such a thing, better avoid, get out, forget

00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:38.500
it.

00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:41.749
I am not going to go to Rama, he has burnt
my tail.

00:43:41.749 --> 00:43:43.259
Tomorrow he will do something else.’

00:43:43.259 --> 00:43:46.190
He burnt the whole of Lanka.

00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:50.549
The whole of it He burnt till Ravana had to
say, that ‘please forgive and go away.’

00:43:50.549 --> 00:43:56.690
He did all kinds of tricks to show that He
was really powerful.

00:43:56.690 --> 00:44:04.119
In so many ways of His sense of responsibility
and His dedication and love is expressed.

00:44:04.119 --> 00:44:14.089
But they say that even if you take once His
name, whatever work you want to do, it can

00:44:14.089 --> 00:44:15.089
be done.

00:44:15.089 --> 00:44:21.160
Any work that you want to be finished will
be done and His day is a Tuesday.

00:44:21.160 --> 00:44:24.859
On Tuesday, if you request Him for anything,
He will help you to do the work.

00:44:24.859 --> 00:44:29.171
But it is not like this that you sit down
and say now come along Hanumana, will you

00:44:29.171 --> 00:44:31.510
please do this job?

00:44:31.510 --> 00:44:35.940
But if you are doing the job, then He comes
to help you.

00:44:35.940 --> 00:44:44.980
Means that He activates, He activates and
He makes your energy flow into that direction

00:44:44.980 --> 00:44:48.559
that your work is done.

00:44:48.559 --> 00:44:49.559
He’s so helpful in so many ways that you
can’t imagine.

00:44:49.559 --> 00:44:57.210
There are so many sahaja yogis have tried
it with that and He has created such miracles

00:44:57.210 --> 00:44:58.950
especially the Australians.

00:44:58.950 --> 00:45:00.499
Somehow they have such a feeling for him.

00:45:00.499 --> 00:45:02.210
I know the reason.

00:45:02.210 --> 00:45:06.420
But they have such a feeling for Him that
every time anything happens, better ask Hanumana.

00:45:06.420 --> 00:45:07.450
They ask Hanumana.

00:45:07.450 --> 00:45:09.510
“Hanumana, now please look after us”.

00:45:09.510 --> 00:45:13.849
And they have told Me that such miraculous
things have happened since they have been

00:45:13.849 --> 00:45:15.039
using Shri Hanumana.

00:45:15.039 --> 00:45:18.670
But you must have the vehicle to carry this
Hanumana.

00:45:18.670 --> 00:45:20.869
He’s a very subtle Deity within you.

00:45:20.869 --> 00:45:27.299
And if you are irresponsible, He hates such
a person.

00:45:27.299 --> 00:45:30.530
He hates, He just can’t bear it.

00:45:30.530 --> 00:45:34.839
He, He thinks they are absolutely useless
people.

00:45:34.839 --> 00:45:38.849
He doesn’t pay attention to such people.

00:45:38.849 --> 00:45:43.829
Those who are not responsible, they may give
any excuses, they may show off, they may do

00:45:43.829 --> 00:45:44.829
anything.

00:45:44.829 --> 00:45:45.829
He just has no care for such people.

00:45:45.829 --> 00:45:50.349
He has no love, no respect, no attention for
the people who are not responsible.

00:45:50.349 --> 00:45:52.710
There’s a very nice English saying: ‘God
helps those who help themselves’.

00:45:52.710 --> 00:45:57.460
English language has so many beautiful things
in it, all these nursery rhymes and everything.

00:45:57.460 --> 00:46:00.660
I wish people would not just utter those sayings
but do it.

00:46:00.660 --> 00:46:03.769
They listen to Me but they don’t do it.

00:46:03.769 --> 00:46:09.580
Now you have heard Me today you should see
how much responsible you are.

00:46:09.580 --> 00:46:15.240
Now we had our first ashram and if there are
others, please excuse Me, because it is an

00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:18.109
open thing and we have to talk about it.

00:46:18.109 --> 00:46:23.029
And I was surprised that in our first ashram,
when I went there, I was amazed.

00:46:23.029 --> 00:46:27.769
I mean, young people living like pigs.

00:46:27.769 --> 00:46:28.769
I couldn’t understand.

00:46:28.769 --> 00:46:34.200
I mean, they are not hippies, they are not
taking any smokes, drinks, or anything.

00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:36.119
They are so irresponsible!

00:46:36.119 --> 00:46:43.180
They go to the bathroom, they come out as
if a bull in a china shop has entered.

00:46:43.180 --> 00:46:45.549
They really live like that, I was amazed.

00:46:45.549 --> 00:46:46.549
How could they?

00:46:46.549 --> 00:46:48.369
And we are all graduates, PhDs, MADs, and
everything.

00:46:48.369 --> 00:46:50.450
I was amazed, what has happened to these people.

00:46:50.450 --> 00:46:51.450
Slowly, slowly they improve.

00:46:51.450 --> 00:47:00.010
But this lot went away and a new lot came
in and a new lot came in.

00:47:00.010 --> 00:47:05.960
And it’s so surprising that once they become
responsible and good, somehow or other Hanumana

00:47:05.960 --> 00:47:07.299
takes them out.

00:47:07.299 --> 00:47:09.970
They just get out of it.

00:47:09.970 --> 00:47:20.259
Now I have to tell you to determine today
to decide that every moment and movement of

00:47:20.259 --> 00:47:24.700
your life you are going to feel responsible
as Hanumana does.

00:47:24.700 --> 00:47:33.550
Any work that you are doing, about Him it
is said, [sentence maybe in Hindi ??]. It

00:47:33.550 --> 00:47:39.980
means for doing any work, He is just ready,
He is just ready.

00:47:39.980 --> 00:47:45.759
You tell him anything, He is just ready to
do it.

00:47:45.759 --> 00:47:52.730
It is His quality that you should have and
that quality is so much lacking today in England.

00:47:52.730 --> 00:47:57.829
All your strikes, all your problems can be
solved.

00:47:57.829 --> 00:48:01.359
First time when I came, I was surprised, I
asked somebody: ‘Are you working?’

00:48:01.359 --> 00:48:04.029
He said: ‘No, I am successfully unemployed.’

00:48:04.029 --> 00:48:11.259
I said: ‘Really, you are successfully unemployed
so how do you eat?’

00:48:11.259 --> 00:48:13.609
‘Oh, we get our doles.’

00:48:13.609 --> 00:48:14.609
‘Oh really.’

00:48:14.609 --> 00:48:16.680
‘We have securities.’

00:48:16.680 --> 00:48:17.980
What are securities, this is nonsense, you
are parasite.

00:48:17.980 --> 00:48:18.980
There is no self-respect.

00:48:18.980 --> 00:48:24.240
Leave alone the respect … [??], there is
no self-respect.

00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:33.069
I was amazed when I told them, all of you
have to take to work.

00:48:33.069 --> 00:48:39.170
Anybody you takes the dole is not going to
stay in the ashram.

00:48:39.170 --> 00:48:43.150
I wish your government would take some note
of it.

00:48:43.150 --> 00:48:45.450
That we have to create responsible citizens.

00:48:45.450 --> 00:48:51.289
In England itself, we have to show that by
Sahaja Yoga you have turned the tables, you

00:48:51.289 --> 00:48:57.940
have got smart people, now efficient, responsible.

00:48:57.940 --> 00:49:00.010
This is what we have to show.

00:49:00.010 --> 00:49:01.920
Once we show this to others, people will be
amazed.

00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:07.539
With other’s money, it’s the same.

00:49:07.539 --> 00:49:09.070
If you can get hold of somebody else’s money
that’s the best thing.

00:49:09.070 --> 00:49:11.569
This is a very common feature.

00:49:11.569 --> 00:49:21.210
First time the sahaja yogis went to India
they came back here, they never wrote a letter

00:49:21.210 --> 00:49:22.589
back thanking them.

00:49:22.589 --> 00:49:23.970
And I was amazed.

00:49:23.970 --> 00:49:25.560
For six months, I said: ‘What are you doing?’

00:49:25.560 --> 00:49:27.619
‘I know we should have written.

00:49:27.619 --> 00:49:31.140
I know we should have written.’

00:49:31.140 --> 00:49:34.660
But why, why didn’t you write?

00:49:34.660 --> 00:49:35.829
No responsibility.

00:49:35.829 --> 00:49:39.009
What is this, I could not understand.

00:49:39.009 --> 00:49:44.819
Gradually they developed and developed and
developed now they feel but those who have

00:49:44.819 --> 00:49:47.180
started feeling are the matured sahaja yogis
I should say.

00:49:47.180 --> 00:49:53.069
But others who are coming to it must now that
you have to have a sense of responsibility.

00:49:53.069 --> 00:49:56.510
Sometimes people who are realised have a feeling:
‘Oh, now we are realised.

00:49:56.510 --> 00:50:00.710
Now, nothing, settle down, have the bliss
of Mother.

00:50:00.710 --> 00:50:03.410
Sit down and enjoy it, nothing doing, it will
stop!’

00:50:03.410 --> 00:50:08.950
You have to be able to give this to others.

00:50:08.950 --> 00:50:14.330
You should emit, if you cannot emit those
vibrations yourself.

00:50:14.330 --> 00:50:18.190
If you are enlightened, you should be able
to give light to others.

00:50:18.190 --> 00:50:23.890
You can raise the Kundalini, alright but what
about your own personality.

00:50:23.890 --> 00:50:29.089
It is so irresponsible which is no where near
Hanumana’s.

00:50:29.089 --> 00:50:42.050
This Hanumana style of complete obedience
to your being, the complete emission of that

00:50:42.050 --> 00:50:45.950
love that you have received, that divine power
you have received.

00:50:45.950 --> 00:50:52.849
Unless and until you achieve that state you
should not be satisfied with your self-realisation.

00:50:52.849 --> 00:51:02.400
Self-realisation is only complete when you
yourself become the giver of light.

00:51:02.400 --> 00:51:06.940
You the guru, you the great stars.

00:51:06.940 --> 00:51:09.380
That’s My ambition.

00:51:09.380 --> 00:51:22.309
I know I expect sometimes from My children
and I want them to understand that I want

00:51:22.309 --> 00:51:41.529
you to be really honoured in the Kingdom of
God as great sons of your Mother.

00:51:41.529 --> 00:51:47.170
May God bless you.

00:51:47.170 --> 00:51:54.480
You know that but keep it up.

00:51:54.480 --> 00:52:03.759
I do encourage you by saying all these things.

00:52:03.759 --> 00:52:10.880
I do awaken Hanumana and Shri Rama within
you.

00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:16.230
No doubt, I know, but keep them awake.

00:52:16.230 --> 00:52:43.230
Keep them alert and you have to
be alert and active, responsible and respectable.

00:52:43.230 --> 00:53:09.519
You have to realise that
you are saints.

00:53:09.519 --> 00:53:19.910
Saints of a very special quality.

00:53:19.910 --> 00:53:35.039
The saints who can give realisations to others.

00:53:35.039 --> 00:53:52.460
There have been not such things like this
before.

00:53:52.460 --> 00:54:39.119
Nor even today there are saints who

00:54:39.119 --> 00:54:57.200
are realised souls but they don’t know how
to give realisation.

00:54:57.200 --> 00:55:12.720
They don’t know so much.

00:55:12.720 --> 00:55:28.599
You have so much of knowledge and everything.

00:55:28.599 --> 00:55:40.099
Except the vehicle is poor.

00:55:40.099 --> 00:55:49.220
It cannot carry the bliss.

00:55:49.220 --> 00:56:00.099
The cup has to be alright.

00:56:00.099 --> 00:56:16.729
Otherwise it cannot carry the beautiful fountain
of love that is pouring down on this earth.

00:56:16.729 --> 00:56:38.640
And that is how you must know that within
you this is awakened, keep it awakened, keep

00:56:38.640 --> 00:56:47.829
it … (vague ?).
Please close your eyes.

00:56:47.829 --> 00:56:53.950
[continues with guided meditation]
