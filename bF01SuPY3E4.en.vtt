WEBVTT

00:00.429 --> 00:02.230
I talk to you about the right side.

00:02.230 --> 00:17.150
Right side sympathetic nervous system which
is expressed by other subtle energy of Mahasaraswati

00:17.150 --> 00:37.400
which gives us the power to act - by left
side we desire and by using the right side,

00:37.400 --> 00:43.720
the power of pingala nadi, we act.

00:43.720 --> 00:48.840
I was telling you about the right side the
other day.

00:48.840 --> 00:54.300
Let us see how our right side is built up.

00:54.300 --> 01:00.590
I’m sorry for people who have come for the
first time but every time when I start the

01:00.590 --> 01:06.580
introduction to the subject, again it becomes
the same but later on I’ll explain to you

01:06.580 --> 01:09.080
about Sahaja.

01:09.080 --> 01:26.659
Now this right side pingala nadi is a very,
very important energy-giving energy

01:26.659 --> 01:30.150
which makes us act and activate.

01:30.150 --> 01:38.210
Now this one is made of all the five elements.

01:38.210 --> 01:46.070
You know all the five elements that have created
our physical being and our mental being.

01:46.070 --> 01:57.060
That’s how it helps us to work out all our
physical and mental problems, mental activities

01:57.060 --> 02:00.070
and mental and physical growth.

02:00.070 --> 02:14.680
Now this being made by those five elements,
when first time human beings started thinking

02:14.680 --> 02:27.859
of doing some action about anything, say in
India, they first thought why not somehow

02:27.859 --> 02:37.760
or other reach to the principle of these elements,
which is beyond physics, which is beyond chemistry.

02:37.760 --> 02:51.931
And to reach to that point, they thought it
would be better if we try to invoke or to

02:51.931 --> 02:59.319
awaken the Deities which are governing those
five elements.

02:59.319 --> 03:04.180
This was a very big mistake though, I should
say.

03:04.180 --> 03:11.839
Because human beings, whatever they take up,
they do not know where to stop.

03:11.839 --> 03:20.569
If you tell them that you have to clean your
teeth everyday, then they’ll go on cleaning

03:20.569 --> 03:23.879
it 12 times in 12 hours.

03:23.879 --> 03:31.939
You tell them anything, they’ll go so far
that they will destroy the instrument which

03:31.939 --> 03:33.729
is suppose to be looked after.

03:33.729 --> 03:39.720
That’s the nature of human beings, they
cannot have brakes to themselves.

03:39.720 --> 03:46.720
They do not have common sense as far as balance
in their life.

03:46.720 --> 03:59.290
So anything you give them, they become so
mad after it that in Marathi there is a word

03:59.290 --> 04:04.369
is that they ultimately put ashes on their
head, to say to declare that I am dead now,

04:04.369 --> 04:05.390
I’ve become ashes.

04:05.390 --> 04:14.680
Like that, they get so frantic that even while
doing this awakening of these principles,

04:14.680 --> 04:21.319
they forgot, lost their sight that we are
after all spirit and not these elements.

04:21.319 --> 04:23.180
We are beyond that.

04:23.180 --> 04:25.090
You have to reach beyond that.

04:25.090 --> 04:34.419
All these elements are only useful for us
to achieve a state in which we can create

04:34.419 --> 04:46.330
things and we can have more time to devote
to meditation to enjoy our self-realisation.

04:46.330 --> 04:57.270
They got completely blinded by the advances
they made on this side which is in pure and

04:57.270 --> 05:00.849
simple words is materialism.

05:00.849 --> 05:06.229
They became so responsible, so efficient.

05:06.229 --> 05:15.490
First in the Vedas, it’s written, the first
stanza is such that by reading these Vedas,

05:15.490 --> 05:22.849
if you do not know your spirit then it is
absolutely useless.

05:22.849 --> 05:26.680
But this stanza they always close down I think.

05:26.680 --> 05:32.650
Then they started worshipping those Deities,
this, that, exciting them, doing all ritualism,

05:32.650 --> 05:37.290
and all that and they just went into it headlong,
absolutely headlong.

05:37.290 --> 05:39.510
They would not turn back.

05:39.510 --> 05:47.949
So by exciting these elements, they discovered
the principles of these elements.

05:47.949 --> 05:53.890
For example, they discovered that gravity
is the essence of the Mother Earth.

05:53.890 --> 05:57.469
But it is not.

05:57.469 --> 05:59.830
That is not the essence of the Mother Earth.

05:59.830 --> 06:06.990
That is the energy that is asserted by Her
but Her essence is Her fragrance.

06:06.990 --> 06:15.659
They could not cross that limit where they
could see really the subtle thing which was

06:15.659 --> 06:19.930
the subtle principle of this energy of gravity
is the fragrance.

06:19.930 --> 06:28.419
All the fragrances come from Her.

06:28.419 --> 06:31.830
Of course man made there are, that’s different.

06:31.830 --> 06:37.199
But even the man made, are also coming from
Her, if you go trace the source, it’s up

06:37.199 --> 06:39.949
to the point, it is from there.

06:39.949 --> 06:48.310
Like that they went on discovering the subtler,
so called subtler energies or the principles

06:48.310 --> 06:53.300
of these elements from the Vedas style.

06:53.300 --> 06:55.900
Then it became a science.

06:55.900 --> 07:02.139
People started studying physics, chemistry,
this, that, understanding what was there before

07:02.139 --> 07:07.610
them, by going into it and trying to find
out what is it made of.

07:07.610 --> 07:16.749
For example, they went into atoms, they went
into say molecules and things and they tried

07:16.749 --> 07:26.810
to find out and there they find the oscillation
of the protons and they find the oscillation

07:26.810 --> 07:29.210
of these atoms.

07:29.210 --> 07:35.610
And they just can’t understand, from where
does this energy of this oscillation is coming.

07:35.610 --> 07:43.509
They could not capture that energy so they
thought better use the energy, so they started

07:43.509 --> 07:45.729
using the energy.

07:45.729 --> 07:51.120
Now it has gone to such a limit of the whole
thing is, now I read, saw that microchips

07:51.120 --> 07:52.689
or something coming up.

07:52.689 --> 08:00.129
After some time you won’t be using hands
or head or anything, it will be that microchips

08:00.129 --> 08:01.330
will be going on.

08:01.330 --> 08:05.930
But with this kind of a thing, with this extreme
behaviour, you’ll become a machine yourself.

08:05.930 --> 08:08.340
A slave of the machine.

08:08.340 --> 08:13.629
Today the petrol is exhausted, tomorrow electricity
is exhausted, then what are you going to do?

08:13.629 --> 08:17.080
You don’t know even to count two plus two.

08:17.080 --> 08:22.770
So you are left without any counting, you’ll
become the same primitive man and I don’t

08:22.770 --> 08:29.590
know what you will be doing, climbing on the
trees and living like monkeys, I don’t know

08:29.590 --> 08:31.249
what will happen.

08:31.249 --> 08:36.409
So all these advancement that you did has
gone too far.

08:36.409 --> 08:43.529
But as a result of too much efficiency, too
much responsibility and all that, you became

08:43.529 --> 08:49.860
sort of addicted to it and then with that
you started dominating other people.

08:49.860 --> 08:55.541
The machinery came in, that you produced such
a lot of machinery style that you didn’t

08:55.541 --> 09:00.570
know what to do so you had to find out markets
where you sell them so you started capturing

09:00.570 --> 09:04.970
other markets where you started selling them
and that’s how all these economic problems

09:04.970 --> 09:06.350
and all this have started.

09:06.350 --> 09:10.540
There are developing countries, there are
developed countries, all things going on in

09:10.540 --> 09:12.060
this mad world.

09:12.060 --> 09:19.620
But we reach a point now where we realise
that this machine has done something nonsensical

09:19.620 --> 09:20.620
within us.

09:20.620 --> 09:25.910
When we reach that point, we start thinking
now what are we to do.

09:25.910 --> 09:33.769
We have been very responsible, not you people
but your forefathers may be, who went to fight

09:33.769 --> 09:39.860
the whole world and do this and they had to
be at right time at right places and do all

09:39.860 --> 09:41.209
sorts of things.

09:41.209 --> 09:47.580
By that over-responsibility you became sort
of fed up, you just didn’t know what to

09:47.580 --> 09:48.580
do.

09:48.580 --> 09:50.770
For example, morning you wear a grey suit,
in the night you have to wear a tail coat

09:50.770 --> 09:57.100
and then if you have to drink your wine, you
have to take a separate glass and for that

09:57.100 --> 09:58.100
this.

09:58.100 --> 10:03.290
It became too much messy you said “Throw
them in the sea”.

10:03.290 --> 10:10.709
We have collected all this nonsense, we have
collected all these forms and horrible things

10:10.709 --> 10:12.750
that have made us so rigid.

10:12.750 --> 10:16.899
That’s how you try to throw away everything
but even then when you throw away, where do

10:16.899 --> 10:17.899
you go?

10:17.899 --> 10:19.750
I mean you have to exist, you cannot just
hang in the air.

10:19.750 --> 10:21.890
So you said now take another style.

10:21.890 --> 10:26.260
And another style is even worse, much worse.

10:26.260 --> 10:35.590
Because then no responsibility, no respect,
no understanding, so this power goes absolutely

10:35.590 --> 10:36.590
zero.

10:36.590 --> 10:39.899
You are tired very soon.

10:39.899 --> 10:46.880
I’ve seen, I mean in the BBC and all that,
young people, I’m a very old woman compared

10:46.880 --> 10:50.730
to them, after saying two three words, they
say “Ahhh”, they go down.

10:50.730 --> 10:52.209
Again after saying something, “Ahhh”.

10:52.209 --> 10:54.279
This is very big acting these days.

10:54.279 --> 10:57.630
In any play you see a person saying, “Ahhh”.

10:57.630 --> 11:04.170
What does it take to act for this kind of
a thing.

11:04.170 --> 11:06.540
This is what is very common.

11:06.540 --> 11:09.209
Now you notice, the reason is you are tired.

11:09.209 --> 11:11.380
You’re absolutely tired, why?

11:11.380 --> 11:23.320
Because your brain is the same old brain and
you have taken a new life, you cannot adjust

11:23.320 --> 11:24.730
yourself to that.

11:24.730 --> 11:29.290
You say that now I am sitting down, doing
nothing, I am not going to be efficient anymore

11:29.290 --> 11:33.880
and all that, I’m sitting down, the brain
is going, chug-chug-chug-chug-chug, morning

11:33.880 --> 11:34.880
till evening.

11:34.880 --> 11:36.120
How to stop this brain?

11:36.120 --> 11:41.370
This brain is working so hard, using up all
your energy, you have no strength.

11:41.370 --> 11:48.139
So to counteract you will say let’s take
to some sort of a thing by which we go out

11:48.139 --> 11:49.389
of this madness.

11:49.389 --> 11:56.269
Let’s take to something that takes you as
we call it the right or the left side, take

11:56.269 --> 12:03.630
something like say hashish, or something like
another thing, LSD, to go to the right or

12:03.630 --> 12:04.690
to the left.

12:04.690 --> 12:08.910
Now what happens with that you know very well.

12:08.910 --> 12:15.070
Now thank God you have realised also to that
was nonsensical action, that was wrong.

12:15.070 --> 12:20.160
These are two areas within us which are called
as Adi Bhautik and Adi Devik.

12:20.160 --> 12:28.790
Now the Adi Bhautik are the ones which take
you to the left side is the subconscious and

12:28.790 --> 12:34.680
the Adi Devik are the ones where you try to
invoke the devas and all that on the right

12:34.680 --> 12:42.269
hand side, that one is the Adi Devik where
we call it supra-conscious area.

12:42.269 --> 12:47.230
These two are of no use to human beings, actually.

12:47.230 --> 12:49.750
They are not meant for human beings.

12:49.750 --> 12:57.050
They are meant for people who are dead, who
are dead souls, who are good for nothing.

12:57.050 --> 12:58.720
Now they cannot get realisation.

12:58.720 --> 13:00.910
It’s not meant for you.

13:00.910 --> 13:04.209
That’s the area you should not reside.

13:04.209 --> 13:08.110
But you enter into these areas because of
extreme natures.

13:08.110 --> 13:14.100
Some people by going into these drugs, some
taking to some sort of movements like mesmerisms,

13:14.100 --> 13:16.740
spiritualisms and all sorts of isms.

13:16.740 --> 13:24.990
Some people onto the right hand side like
taking to what you call these people who are

13:24.990 --> 13:30.090
racialists and all such organisations which
are racialist and this and that and you know

13:30.090 --> 13:33.000
all that kind of a people, like Hitlerish
type.

13:33.000 --> 13:38.410
All this is nothing but is a kind of intoxicant
which makes you forget the reality, that you

13:38.410 --> 13:46.339
are a human being, that you have to become
the spirit, that you are the spirit is the

13:46.339 --> 13:47.339
reality.

13:47.339 --> 13:55.990
Now the present trend in the Western life
is very much set in this country about which

13:55.990 --> 13:57.700
I am very much concerned.

13:57.700 --> 14:04.250
I’ve talked about to many people in person
and also the vibes (?), that the quality of

14:04.250 --> 14:09.870
the mind, because we are with the English,
let’s talk about the English.

14:09.870 --> 14:14.610
Quality of mind of English is excellent, I’ve
said it always.

14:14.610 --> 14:19.470
And the young people of English have a very
good quality of mind.

14:19.470 --> 14:22.709
But their heart is lacking.

14:22.709 --> 14:25.259
They’re frightened of what God alone knows
but they are frightened.

14:25.259 --> 14:26.800
Why they have taken this course, I don’t
know.

14:26.800 --> 14:30.450
Now to do any work, also they’re frightened.

14:30.450 --> 14:36.269
Supposing we put this colour, then it may
not match, it doesn’t matter, doesn’t

14:36.269 --> 14:37.269
matter.

14:37.269 --> 14:38.329
What does it matter?

14:38.329 --> 14:43.620
Because of those previous ideas they are so
frightened of doing anything, though they

14:43.620 --> 14:51.660
say they have broken all those ideas and they
have taken to new liberated ways and all that.

14:51.660 --> 14:57.110
But this liberation is also another madness
in which they’re fear has now gone.

14:57.110 --> 15:05.819
So the quality of mind of we the English sahaja
yogis and English people is excellent.

15:05.819 --> 15:11.220
If you talk to them, you’ll think you are
talking to a scholar, I mean no less than

15:11.220 --> 15:12.220
Shakespeare.

15:12.220 --> 15:17.000
They could be very well read, they will know
about anything you ask them, what is this

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
road?

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
This is the road!

15:19.000 --> 15:21.160
Now, what is the name of this road?

15:21.160 --> 15:22.160
This is the gentleman.

15:22.160 --> 15:24.160
Who was his grandfather, what he did, what
was the gossip about him, scandals, everything.

15:24.160 --> 15:30.910
You can get everything from them, they know
everything about everything.

15:30.910 --> 15:37.529
Sometimes I’m amazed the way people know
about things.

15:37.529 --> 15:41.730
About all the details as to how many women
he had, and how many wives he divorced and

15:41.730 --> 15:44.279
what he did and where he went and what he
wrote.

15:44.279 --> 15:51.100
Take anyone, take a writer, or take an artist,
or take a hooligan, or take a robber or anyone

15:51.100 --> 15:57.160
who has appeared on the newspaper as if they
have drunk all the newspaper into their memory.

15:57.160 --> 16:04.040
The whole thing is so clear cut in their mind
that is sometimes, I mean.

16:04.040 --> 16:13.970
But if you tell them to fix one chair, never
trust that chair (everyone laughing).

16:13.970 --> 16:14.970
Never trust it.

16:14.970 --> 16:20.829
If you ask them to do anything, they’ll
tell you: ‘Alright, tomorrow at 7 sharp,

16:20.829 --> 16:22.319
I’ll be there.’

16:22.319 --> 16:27.279
Even if he comes after 7 days, thank your
stars.

16:27.279 --> 16:31.569
I’ve known people who have been done this
to me.

16:31.569 --> 16:35.899
Now it’s 4 years, I’ve never seen their
faces again.

16:35.899 --> 16:43.510
They’re supposed to be XYZ from Oxford and
ABCD from Cambridge.

16:43.510 --> 16:46.500
They have got first class first and this and
that.

16:46.500 --> 16:50.430
If you go into their rooms, you will find
it’s a pig sty.

16:50.430 --> 16:53.690
You don’t know where you have landed.

16:53.690 --> 16:56.589
I mean, you don’t believe that it belongs
to any educated person, there’s no sense

16:56.589 --> 16:57.879
of responsibility left in their head.

16:57.879 --> 17:05.210
I mean this energy that is working in the
head, if it is not put into a responsible

17:05.210 --> 17:10.970
channel, no wonder, we find every third person
is a paranoid, something wrong with the brain.

17:10.970 --> 17:17.320
What is wrong with the brain is that so much
energy is here and you are not channelizing

17:17.320 --> 17:18.530
it at all.

17:18.530 --> 17:22.300
By what ways are we to channelize it.

17:22.300 --> 17:29.580
Even after realisation, I find people have
no respect for anything.

17:29.580 --> 17:34.850
Sometimes it’s most surprising that with
all this brain activity going on, they get

17:34.850 --> 17:36.440
all the satisfaction from the spirit.

17:36.440 --> 17:43.840
They’re raising the Kundalini and all that
but they have lost that capacity to be responsible

17:43.840 --> 17:50.250
and that’s why in Sahaja Yoga also they
are not responsible.

17:50.250 --> 17:55.830
This goes on not only about their own private
work but about Sahaja Yoga about everything.

17:55.830 --> 17:58.170
So this quality of mind has no heart.

17:58.170 --> 17:59.830
It has no, it has heart in nothing.

17:59.830 --> 18:06.610
Supposing I am telling you something, I don’t
know about sahaja yogis as such, but now…

18:06.610 --> 18:13.020
I’ve seen with people, you give them a lecture
for one year, one hour, it’s lost, finished.

18:13.020 --> 18:15.370
They’re just the same, what has happened.

18:15.370 --> 18:20.280
It’s only the vibrations, it’s only how
you work it out that the life changes and

18:20.280 --> 18:21.280
all that.

18:21.280 --> 18:24.640
But as far as they are concerned, nothing
is recorded in the memory.

18:24.640 --> 18:27.710
Sometimes I feel how do I talk?

18:27.710 --> 18:30.720
Is it too much on their heads or below their
feet?

18:30.720 --> 18:32.770
Where is it flowing?

18:32.770 --> 18:37.380
So the reason is that the heart is lost.

18:37.380 --> 18:42.920
If you register it through your heart, you
will do it.

18:42.920 --> 18:45.320
If you put your heart into things you will
do it.

18:45.320 --> 18:53.710
The heart is as I told you is chicken-hearted,
is absolutely chicken-hearted.

18:53.710 --> 18:56.870
And that’s why, this is what is lacking
in our character.

18:56.870 --> 19:04.040
For that now the stage has reached, we have
to raise our right side, not the left side.

19:04.040 --> 19:13.350
Our right side is absolutely finished and
there the leader of the right side are two

19:13.350 --> 19:14.350
persons.

19:14.350 --> 19:15.350
The Deities are two persons.

19:15.350 --> 19:19.541
Of course Brahmadeva is the one who is the
creator, who has created this universe and

19:19.541 --> 19:25.200
who is the one who is busy still creating
and doing lots of things for you people.

19:25.200 --> 19:34.680
But I would suggest that we have to pay attention
to two ideals we have in the history.

19:34.680 --> 19:40.380
For this to understand what sort of ideals
we should have, because the right side is

19:40.380 --> 19:45.800
a Rajo Guna is the one by which you become
majestic, you become royal, you achieve all

19:45.800 --> 19:47.320
the Rajo Guna as you know that.

19:47.320 --> 19:51.430
Now two persons are really to be followed
on there.

19:51.430 --> 19:55.130
One of them is Shri Ram.

19:55.130 --> 20:03.100
Shri Ram resides on the right heart and is
the father.

20:03.100 --> 20:07.400
He is the father and He is the fatherhood.

20:07.400 --> 20:13.510
He is the one who came on this earth to teach
us how to be a father as a king.

20:13.510 --> 20:14.670
He is a father king.

20:14.670 --> 20:21.390
He is a benevolent king, which was described
before [??] He is the benevolent.

20:21.390 --> 20:29.690
He was the ideal that came on this earth to
teach us how to be responsible to others,

20:29.690 --> 20:36.240
how to respect others, how to understand the
feelings of others.

20:36.240 --> 20:48.790
To such an extent He went that He had to sacrifice
His own wife for the sake of His own state.

20:48.790 --> 20:57.250
He did that and He had to ask His wife who
was pregnant to go and live with a very great

20:57.250 --> 20:58.250
sage.

20:58.250 --> 21:02.500
One may say that what was He doing about His
wife.

21:02.500 --> 21:03.960
She was the Goddess.

21:03.960 --> 21:09.840
She was so remarkable that He was not bothered
about Her.

21:09.840 --> 21:15.660
He was so sure of Her powers that He did it
and there is nothing wrong in leaving things

21:15.660 --> 21:21.490
to the Goddess to do instead of meddling with
Her all the time.

21:21.490 --> 21:30.810
But this gentleman Shri Rama, understood the
responsibility of a king and that responsibility

21:30.810 --> 21:32.740
is lacking in us.

21:32.740 --> 21:35.820
That responsibility towards ourselves and
towards others.

21:35.820 --> 21:38.380
It is very, very surprising.

21:38.380 --> 21:41.850
I mean I came from India.

21:41.850 --> 21:48.570
I’d never met Englishmen at this close quarters
till I came to England I should say.

21:48.570 --> 21:50.780
Because before that we met all missionaries.

21:50.780 --> 21:55.360
All missionaries were terribly responsible
for converting all the people into Christianity.

21:55.360 --> 22:00.770
They will get up early in the morning, take
their Bible, go around to all the places,

22:00.770 --> 22:06.110
cleaning all the dirty lanes and cleaning
all the children like bits of paper see, cleaning

22:06.110 --> 22:10.910
all the dirty people there, kiss them and
do all impressive things to convert the people.

22:10.910 --> 22:15.560
They would go even to the forest to convert.

22:15.560 --> 22:22.530
They were so responsible about it that they
felt they have to do it, this is God’s job,

22:22.530 --> 22:28.590
they’re doing God’s job, they must convert,
and they went on with this and that’s how

22:28.590 --> 22:30.430
some of the people I met.

22:30.430 --> 22:32.620
Then the rulers, the rulers are extremely
responsible.

22:32.620 --> 22:34.540
They were ruthless and they thought this was
the greatest thing they are doing to spread

22:34.540 --> 22:36.120
British Raj and that was their responsibility.

22:36.120 --> 22:41.190
When it comes to spreading God’s Raj you
are not.

22:41.190 --> 22:46.170
First of all in our own life, we should see
are we responsible.

22:46.170 --> 22:52.890
Now in the modern times I find that we have
got rid of that sense of responsibility, it’s

22:52.890 --> 22:55.860
called as a sense of diminishing responsibility.

22:55.860 --> 23:03.720
You’ll just say yes, yes, I know, I should
have, I know, I know.

23:03.720 --> 23:05.030
I can’t understand.

23:05.030 --> 23:10.700
If you have a heart, how can you say that,
that I know I should not have done.

23:10.700 --> 23:11.700
I know, I should have been doing.

23:11.700 --> 23:17.040
The reason is there is no heart and the heart
always catches when your right side over acts.

23:17.040 --> 23:20.510
That means your brain is active too much and
there is no real action the outward of it.

23:20.510 --> 23:27.320
You think too much and do not put it to practice.

23:27.320 --> 23:33.780
I should have gone, I should have done this,
I should have said so, and this is the problem

23:33.780 --> 23:35.390
with our right side.

23:35.390 --> 23:42.270
Now, among our sahaja yogis also, I find people
have the problem of the right side.

23:42.270 --> 23:50.630
To worship the right side, we have to see
to Shri Ram.

23:50.630 --> 23:52.860
How He felt responsible for the whole world.

23:52.860 --> 23:55.680
How He use to look after people.

23:55.680 --> 23:59.560
How He looked after the things of other people.

23:59.560 --> 24:03.420
How He behaved towards other people, that’s
a very important thing which we have to learn.

24:03.420 --> 24:05.360
But I find people coming, if it is somebody
else’s, they’ll throw.

24:05.360 --> 24:11.670
They will just jump into something and say
that alright, this is my house I just settle

24:11.670 --> 24:13.410
down here, the way I like.

24:13.410 --> 24:17.580
There’s no sense of responsibility at all
about it, that you have come to somebody else’s

24:17.580 --> 24:18.580
house.

24:18.580 --> 24:20.230
You have to have some care about it.

24:20.230 --> 24:26.520
In the same way you have to know you have
come in the world of God.

24:26.520 --> 24:29.450
This is the Kingdom of God where you have
entered.

24:29.450 --> 24:30.780
You have been a stranger.

24:30.780 --> 24:35.080
Today you are a guest in His house, what are
you doing about it.

24:35.080 --> 24:37.140
How are you behaving?

24:37.140 --> 24:38.970
Are you responsible?

24:38.970 --> 24:45.750
Are you like Shri Rama who took it up Himself,
all the problems of the world and still He

24:45.750 --> 24:46.800
was so responsible.

24:46.800 --> 24:52.100
He would not do anything even this much to
disturb a person.

24:52.100 --> 25:01.270
As far as possible He would like to try to
console, and have the formalities of good

25:01.270 --> 25:02.270
living.

25:02.270 --> 25:05.160
Formality is meant for good living and good
understanding.

25:05.160 --> 25:09.010
Unless and until you have this sense of responsibility,
your collectivity cannot be alright.

25:09.010 --> 25:12.330
You cannot be collectively alright.

25:12.330 --> 25:14.930
You need not be a machine for that.

25:14.930 --> 25:21.270
There is no need to be a machine, like Japanese,
only one person says another doesn’t come.

25:21.270 --> 25:27.630
But this one kind of a funny individualism
that you have got will never give you that

25:27.630 --> 25:32.000
collectivity that is expected of Sahaja Yoga.

25:32.000 --> 25:37.940
We all have to be one, being responsible for
each other.

25:37.940 --> 25:41.540
Not only for one or two persons, because he
is my friend, he is my husband, she is my

25:41.540 --> 25:43.290
wife but for all of us.

25:43.290 --> 25:49.440
We have to be responsible for their things,
for their children, for their house, for everything.

25:49.440 --> 25:51.250
We have to be responsible.

25:51.250 --> 25:58.010
And if this sense of responsibility is lacking,
how will you have responsibility for your

25:58.010 --> 25:59.010
self-realisation.

25:59.010 --> 26:04.580
Only it can be a self-centred thing, thinking
that I’m very much better, my powers are

26:04.580 --> 26:07.270
better, I must have more powers.

26:07.270 --> 26:14.630
But if you do not have this sense of responsibility
why should God also give you powers.

26:14.630 --> 26:22.470
The main thing is your right side is completely
weak, that is the surya nadi, that is the

26:22.470 --> 26:27.340
nadi which is called as the nadi by which
people hold their prana, so it gives you the

26:27.340 --> 26:28.340
prana shakti.

26:28.340 --> 26:36.710
It’s the prana shakti within you which is
the vital force of energy within you, which

26:36.710 --> 26:37.750
is lacking.

26:37.750 --> 26:44.380
Now this lacking is added up by your heart,
at least for a man like that whose prana shakti

26:44.380 --> 26:45.530
is exhausted.

26:45.530 --> 26:52.350
At least for such a man if the heart is there,
he can really use that power which is accumulating

26:52.350 --> 26:58.040
in the head and exhausting him, like eating
up his brain.

26:58.040 --> 26:59.950
If he has the heart in it.

26:59.950 --> 27:06.420
Now this is what I have told you last time
that the right side of human beings is very

27:06.420 --> 27:14.210
important when it comes to Sahaja Yoga because
when the Kundalini rises, your right side

27:14.210 --> 27:16.940
is also, right side is also awakened.

27:16.940 --> 27:22.620
Now the question is why Sahaja Yoga does not
spread in England so far.

27:22.620 --> 27:24.860
This is a very good question.

27:24.860 --> 27:26.710
Many people have asked it.

27:26.710 --> 27:29.300
While in Australia it’s spread so fast.

27:29.300 --> 27:33.410
The reason is the right side is missing.

27:33.410 --> 27:36.220
The right side to be awakened, first of all
there should be some right side.

27:36.220 --> 27:38.400
If there is no right side, what do you awaken?

27:38.400 --> 27:43.010
If there is no light at all, what are you
going to awaken?

27:43.010 --> 27:46.740
There has to be a lamp to be awakened.

27:46.740 --> 27:53.540
So all these topics and talks that we have
in the society: ,I know, I know’, and then

27:53.540 --> 27:57.940
you ask them this and they say: ‘I don’t’
[?]. How are you, like.

27:57.940 --> 28:01.750
[?] All these accents and all that, one should
give up.

28:01.750 --> 28:04.350
One should know that you have to be responsible.

28:04.350 --> 28:08.950
That’s a very, very important thing of life.

28:08.950 --> 28:14.570
I personally think unless and until you feel
that responsibility, that heart into Sahaja

28:14.570 --> 28:18.550
Yoga you will enjoy just by talk as you would
just enjoy anything else.

28:18.550 --> 28:23.230
Real enjoyment comes when your spirit really
blows out the vibrations.

28:23.230 --> 28:28.330
You are taking my vibrations alright, you
are feeling them.

28:28.330 --> 28:30.740
But what about yours?

28:30.740 --> 28:35.930
Are you blowing your vibrations out or they
are just eating your brain.

28:35.930 --> 28:40.210
Simple questions, are you blowing any vibrations
outside?

28:40.210 --> 28:47.360
We have some sahaja yogis when they just enter
into a house, immediately, everyone feels

28:47.360 --> 28:48.360
it.

28:48.360 --> 28:51.760
Everyone can feel it that somebody has come.

28:51.760 --> 28:56.250
Immediately, the whole thing cools down in
no time, somebody has come.

28:56.250 --> 28:59.040
There are some here also, not that there are
none.

28:59.040 --> 29:01.000
But they’re few.

29:01.000 --> 29:03.880
You have to blow out vibrations, otherwise
you are just a liability to yourself.

29:03.880 --> 29:06.630
Why don’t you blow out vibrations, because
you don’t feel responsible.

29:06.630 --> 29:15.230
In your day to day life, morning till evening,
you have to see that you develop this instrument

29:15.230 --> 29:18.100
of responsibility within you.

29:18.100 --> 29:24.340
Otherwise the vibrations won’t flow because
the main reason is that our nervous system

29:24.340 --> 29:29.370
comes to us through our right side.

29:29.370 --> 29:35.980
Our nervous system is built up by our right
side.

29:35.980 --> 29:39.150
All the elements within us have built up.

29:39.150 --> 29:44.020
If the elements are weakened, if the chakras
which are made by these elements, as you know

29:44.020 --> 29:48.760
all these charkas are made by elements, if
the part is weak, nothing is going to work

29:48.760 --> 29:49.760
out.

29:49.760 --> 29:59.070
You should be able to hold that water of love
or you can say the water of bliss and should

29:59.070 --> 30:04.280
be able to pour it out to others.

30:04.280 --> 30:10.350
Unless and until you are able to do that,
Sahaja Yoga won’t spread.

30:10.350 --> 30:12.750
It will spread very slowly.

30:12.750 --> 30:17.120
This is the difference I feel between English
and Australians.

30:17.120 --> 30:19.980
That the quality of mind is thousands times
better than Australians.

30:19.980 --> 30:21.450
They are not scholars.

30:21.450 --> 30:24.410
I found very few people there who are even
graduates.

30:24.410 --> 30:26.530
Here everybody is a PhD or may be a MAD.

30:26.530 --> 30:29.670
But they are all very well educated.

30:29.670 --> 30:35.900
Despite all that, Sahaja Yoga does not spread
out, why?

30:35.900 --> 30:40.670
The reason is the quality of mind is good,
but the action is extremely poor because they’re

30:40.670 --> 30:43.760
exhausted, tired, you are fighting in the
mind.

30:43.760 --> 30:44.860
You are not doing anything by which you blow
it out.

30:44.860 --> 30:54.480
The right side is what you call the Brahmas,
the Brahmadeva’s creation and the Brahma

30:54.480 --> 30:56.940
Shakti as they call it.

30:56.940 --> 31:02.940
This is the power of Brahma which is flowing
through you.

31:02.940 --> 31:08.750
We call it the power of the spirit, it’s
true.

31:08.750 --> 31:13.260
But the spirit, the power of the spirit flows
on your central nervous system.

31:13.260 --> 31:21.020
If there is the electricity all stored up
here and there are very weak wires, what can

31:21.020 --> 31:24.970
you do with all that stored up energy.

31:24.970 --> 31:33.140
The wires have to be improved and for this
wire your right side has to be improved immensely.

31:33.140 --> 31:37.980
Every minute you have to be responsible and
this is what is lacking.

31:37.980 --> 31:42.970
Then I find when … for [incomrehensible]
responsible, they feel extremely hurt.

31:42.970 --> 31:47.620
They feel that they should really shout and
scream and should do something.

31:47.620 --> 31:52.340
They don’t know that these are really the
saints, they are realised souls.

31:52.340 --> 31:54.230
They are great people, no doubt.

31:54.230 --> 31:58.230
But their right side is weakened.

31:58.230 --> 32:04.990
But that is not a great thing to accept, it
is a very bad thing.

32:04.990 --> 32:07.430
But that does not mean you should feel guilty
again, I am saying.

32:07.430 --> 32:09.640
Because very nice, this is the way you manage
is to feel guilty.

32:09.640 --> 32:12.030
Because feeling guilty is the best way, ‘I’m
sorry, I’m sorry.

32:12.030 --> 32:13.030
I should have done it.

32:13.030 --> 32:16.610
I know, I know’ – finished!

32:16.610 --> 32:17.630
Then how can you improve?

32:17.630 --> 32:22.720
If you are about fear filled up all the time
with responsibility denied, all the junk you

32:22.720 --> 32:30.090
have created out of that, you are pushing
into that pouch and then you say: ‘Yes,

32:30.090 --> 32:32.940
yes, I know, I should not have done that!’

32:32.940 --> 32:35.911
Now what can you do?

32:35.911 --> 32:39.630
As I mother you can’t say ‘you’ll hang
yourself by the nearest tree’.

32:39.630 --> 32:41.260
What do I do?

32:41.260 --> 32:43.020
I’m just look at you flabbergasted.

32:43.020 --> 32:44.020
I said: ‘Really?’

32:44.020 --> 32:45.020
‘Yes, I should have done but I haven’t
done it.’

32:45.020 --> 32:46.930
For example, I should tell somebody you better
cook for 10 people, they are coming and the

32:46.930 --> 32:53.340
person says: ‘No, I’m sorry, I forgot,
I didn’t cook.’

32:53.340 --> 32:54.500
You are doomed.

32:54.500 --> 32:55.500
You cannot hit him with the back can you?

32:55.500 --> 32:56.500
What to do.

32:56.500 --> 32:57.500
That’s how you are at a standstill.

32:57.500 --> 32:58.500
You really don’t know how to deal.

32:58.500 --> 33:03.610
The point is in all this talking of spirit
and God, one has to know the vehicle has to

33:03.610 --> 33:04.610
be better.

33:04.610 --> 33:08.430
The vehicle is so very poor that it cannot
carry, otherwise you will emit vibrations

33:08.430 --> 33:09.430
like that.

33:09.430 --> 33:10.430
I know you can.

33:10.430 --> 33:11.480
Wherever you stand you’ll attract.

33:11.480 --> 33:12.610
People must gather round.

33:12.610 --> 33:19.070
You’ll be amazed, I went to Australia for
how many months, at the most a month or so.

33:19.070 --> 33:26.460
I came back from there, already seven centres
have started and every centre has got at least

33:26.460 --> 33:33.910
300 regular people coming.

33:33.910 --> 33:37.990
It is not to feel guilty.

33:37.990 --> 33:43.130
I’m not saying, but to awaken yourself.

33:43.130 --> 33:45.372
To arise to this point.

33:45.372 --> 33:51.762
To be elated with understanding that you have
to rise up to that point and that you have

33:51.762 --> 33:55.130
to take up that position because you are the
warriors of truth.

33:55.130 --> 33:59.520
You are the people who are seekers who have
been for ages and you have no business to

33:59.520 --> 34:00.520
be irresponsible.

34:00.520 --> 34:04.230
You have to do it.

34:04.230 --> 34:10.100
It is my earnest desire that you understand
what I am saying.

34:10.100 --> 34:14.990
Just sitting, meditating, putting hands towards
me or towards the photograph is not everything.

34:14.990 --> 34:16.119
You are still receiving.

34:16.119 --> 34:18.879
You are still at the receiving end.

34:18.879 --> 34:21.049
You have to be on the giving end.

34:21.049 --> 34:22.339
How will you do it?

34:22.339 --> 34:27.250
You get so many vibrations sometimes that
you cannot feel after some time, it’s so

34:27.250 --> 34:28.250
filled the pitcher is so much filled.

34:28.250 --> 34:29.250
But what about pouring it out?

34:29.250 --> 34:30.460
Why you cannot pour it out?

34:30.460 --> 34:39.639
The reason is that the vehicle within you,
which is the right side, is the pingala nadi,

34:39.639 --> 34:42.700
is out of gear.

34:42.700 --> 34:44.510
And this is what one has to understand.

34:44.510 --> 34:50.790
That can be built up only when you know about
Shri Rama’s life, the way He led His life.

34:50.790 --> 34:53.389
Every minute of His life was dynamic.

34:53.389 --> 34:59.230
Not a single minute He wasted in life.

34:59.230 --> 35:05.259
Every minute, whether He was in the forest
or He went to a place with His wife when He

35:05.259 --> 35:13.130
was in exile, and there He knew His wife was
a very shy lady and She would not take Her

35:13.130 --> 35:16.140
bath in the open.

35:16.140 --> 35:18.490
So there’s a rock which is completely holed
out.

35:18.490 --> 35:23.540
Such a big rock, holed out can you imagine.

35:23.540 --> 35:26.799
Inside there is a water.

35:26.799 --> 35:29.710
Water taps sort of a thing coming out, there’s
a water coming out.

35:29.710 --> 35:36.549
So that there’s stone here, stone here,
stone there, and at the end of it there’s

35:36.549 --> 35:40.299
an opening so that there’s light coming
from this side, light coming from that side

35:40.299 --> 35:42.450
but inside nobody can see.

35:42.450 --> 35:43.730
There are trees.

35:43.730 --> 35:49.359
There are trees like which are called as chikakaye
[??] means that its kind of a soap giving

35:49.359 --> 35:52.559
tree are created by Him for His wife.

35:52.559 --> 36:01.030
Anywhere He lived He created a new dimension,
a new house, a new style of life.

36:01.030 --> 36:03.510
Of course He was an incarnation you can say.

36:03.510 --> 36:10.880
But He’s your ideal and not those people
who sit out for hours together drinking something

36:10.880 --> 36:14.599
and thinking they are great martials.

36:14.599 --> 36:19.109
I see all of them sitting here at a church
here and one of them was asked by someone

36:19.109 --> 36:21.700
who was passing: ‘What are you doing?’

36:21.700 --> 36:22.750
‘We killing ourselves!’

36:22.750 --> 36:24.500
Very proudly to say that.

36:24.500 --> 36:29.390
I mean I just don’t understand, what business
have they got to kill themselves.

36:29.390 --> 36:33.710
How much time it has taken God to create them
and here they are sitting and proudly telling

36:33.710 --> 36:35.500
that we are killing ourselves.

36:35.500 --> 36:41.460
This is the situation in which I suddenly
find myself.

36:41.460 --> 36:44.440
So I ask you what should I do?

36:44.440 --> 36:45.810
How should I do?

36:45.810 --> 36:50.440
You have to feel responsible in every way
of life.

36:50.440 --> 36:58.070
But you do not think that there is anything
wrong if you are a hanky panky person.

36:58.070 --> 37:01.650
If your feathers are falling everywhere, it’s
alright.

37:01.650 --> 37:04.529
To you it really does not matter.

37:04.529 --> 37:07.160
But to the Divine it does.

37:07.160 --> 37:15.950
That means a person cannot convey the message
of God, cannot emit it, the bliss of God,

37:15.950 --> 37:20.799
cannot pour that love.

37:20.799 --> 37:24.990
We have to become very responsible in every
day life.

37:24.990 --> 37:26.730
I’m not saying that in Sahaja Yoga but in
every day life, how you live, what you do.

37:26.730 --> 37:32.819
Are you only worried about yourself or you
are worried about others?

37:32.819 --> 37:34.710
Are you responsible for others?

37:34.710 --> 37:40.539
I mean the modern style is not even to wish
good morning, it’s regarded bad manners.

37:40.539 --> 37:47.270
You see it is bad manners even to open door
to someone, it is bad manners.

37:47.270 --> 37:48.570
They think it’s slavish.

37:48.570 --> 37:52.799
I mean, all manners, all those things, all
responsibility, seems to be slavish.

37:52.799 --> 37:58.863
And this kind of modern ideas that are floating
in the air, you should throw them away.

37:58.863 --> 38:00.869
You have to be human beings of a very great
quality.

38:00.869 --> 38:04.500
You have to be people who have created new
worlds.

38:04.500 --> 38:08.150
You are going to create that, I know.

38:08.150 --> 38:13.890
You have to just rise up to that point and
not to sink into your guilt’s and say: ‘Oh

38:13.890 --> 38:14.890
God, what have we been doing?’

38:14.890 --> 38:19.520
No, awake and arise and get it what you have
to do.

38:19.520 --> 38:24.559
That is what I feel about England.

38:24.559 --> 38:29.299
England is so great and is the heart, is the
heart.

38:29.299 --> 38:34.640
And look at the condition of the heart.

38:34.640 --> 38:37.799
Your heart is so weak.

38:37.799 --> 38:43.660
There’s no heart to anything.

38:43.660 --> 38:50.520
Alright you love Me, I love you, but what
about you loving others, and loving other

38:50.520 --> 38:51.520
things.

38:51.520 --> 38:54.529
Loving doesn’t mean writing love letters.

38:54.529 --> 38:58.780
Doing something about it.

38:58.780 --> 39:02.730
And that’s what, ‘the doing something’
is missing and lacking.

39:02.730 --> 39:08.570
And that’s what we have to build up our
right side properly, into proper shape.

39:08.570 --> 39:15.050
If we have to really do the cooking, we have
to know how to light the fire within us and

39:15.050 --> 39:18.819
not to sit down and worry how to do it.

39:18.819 --> 39:24.869
It is a very great thing to come to England
really.

39:24.869 --> 39:32.529
For one reason that this is the place where
Sahaja Yoga is going to work out.

39:32.529 --> 39:36.079
It is going to circulate in the whole world,
I know through you people.

39:36.079 --> 39:45.450
But if you do not improve the communication
wires of yours is become completely stagnant

39:45.450 --> 39:49.950
and the responsibility of this stagnation
will be on you the Sahaja Yogis of London,

39:49.950 --> 39:58.029
because you did not put your life together,
that’s why it did not work.

39:58.029 --> 40:00.640
It’s a tremendous responsibility.

40:00.640 --> 40:05.099
Of course to be responsible is wrong for wrong
things.

40:05.099 --> 40:13.380
But not to be responsible for Divine work
when God has blessed you with self-realisation,

40:13.380 --> 40:23.009
is absolutely against God, against yourself,
against Sahaja Yoga.

40:23.009 --> 40:27.890
The other personality which I was talking
about is Shri Hanumana.

40:27.890 --> 40:37.609
Shri Hanumana is such a great powerful personality
about whom I did not tell you.

40:37.609 --> 40:46.079
That, I mean, Rama once, you see His brother
was hit by an arrow.

40:46.079 --> 40:53.490
And Rama said to Hanumana, that: ‘Why don’t
you go and get a particular type of a medicine

40:53.490 --> 40:59.849
for him and you get it on a particular hill,
mountain, so you go and get that particular

40:59.849 --> 41:00.920
thing.’

41:00.920 --> 41:07.280
So He had a power, He had nine powers, navadha
shakti He had, nine powers, by which He could

41:07.280 --> 41:08.810
become small, He could become big.

41:08.810 --> 41:10.540
And He could lift anything.

41:10.540 --> 41:14.440
He had lots of powers like that, so nine powers:
anima (remark: reducing one’s physical self

41:14.440 --> 41:17.069
to the size of an atom), lagima (remark: lightness),
garima (remark: increase weight) - like that.

41:17.069 --> 41:19.230
He could become so heavy that nobody could
lift Him.

41:19.230 --> 41:23.930
I mean these are the powers He has got of
the right hand side.

41:23.930 --> 41:31.140
And so He went down to that mountain and He
couldn’t see that anywhere, He just couldn’t

41:31.140 --> 41:32.140
see.

41:32.140 --> 41:33.950
He said: ‘Why not take the whole mountain?’

41:33.950 --> 41:39.500
He took the whole mountain on Himself and
He brought it to Rama and said: ‘Now, select

41:39.500 --> 41:41.599
whichever one you like.’

41:41.599 --> 41:44.130
He could have come back and said: ‘Oh, I
can’t find!

41:44.130 --> 41:46.910
I’m sorry, I know, I’ve been useless.’

41:46.910 --> 41:49.980
If He was an Englishman.

41:49.980 --> 41:55.190
But He said: ‘Alright, if you want!’

41:55.190 --> 41:56.539
He brought the whole mountain, now come along
have it.

41:56.539 --> 42:05.359
In every way of His life, you see His sense
of responsibility and how He carries on.

42:05.359 --> 42:16.789
For example, He was sent to Ravana and He
was asked by Ravana that he told Him that

42:16.789 --> 42:19.550
you cannot stay in this place, why did you
come here.

42:19.550 --> 42:25.599
Actually, first He was, He went to Sita and
told Her that ‘Shri Rama had sent Me’

42:25.599 --> 42:31.619
and He showed the ring and She recognised
that was the ring of Her husband.

42:31.619 --> 42:34.269
And He said: ‘Mother if you want, I can
take you on my back.’

42:34.269 --> 42:35.269
But She said no.

42:35.269 --> 42:38.420
Already you see I am a woman who has come
with another man.

42:38.420 --> 42:42.710
You don’t want to have another bad name
and you’ll have a bad name, so I will not

42:42.710 --> 42:43.710
come.

42:43.710 --> 42:44.710
So it’s alright.

42:44.710 --> 42:48.710
You can go back and tell Rama that I am alright.

42:48.710 --> 42:52.059
‘You as a husband, come and fight this man.

42:52.059 --> 42:54.289
Otherwise I’m not going to come.’

42:54.289 --> 42:57.420
So then He was caught up and taken to Ravana.

42:57.420 --> 43:05.980
Now Ravana said that ‘you are a monkey and
what have you come to do it’.

43:05.980 --> 43:11.660
He said that ‘you better release His wife
of Shri Rama and He is such and such’.

43:11.660 --> 43:16.160
So He said ‘that you monkey, you are telling
me this’.

43:16.160 --> 43:18.010
Alright, he said: ‘Burn His tail.’

43:18.010 --> 43:21.289
He said: ‘If you burn my tail, I know how
to use.’

43:21.289 --> 43:24.759
He knows how the responsibility of the tail
is.

43:24.759 --> 43:31.520
He started burning the whole of Lanka with
His tail and He could have said that: ‘Alright

43:31.520 --> 43:37.500
he burnt my tail I better run away, why to
do such a thing, better avoid, get out, forget

43:37.500 --> 43:38.500
it.

43:38.500 --> 43:41.749
I am not going to go to Rama, he has burnt
my tail.

43:41.749 --> 43:43.259
Tomorrow he will do something else.’

43:43.259 --> 43:46.190
He burnt the whole of Lanka.

43:46.190 --> 43:50.549
The whole of it He burnt till Ravana had to
say, that ‘please forgive and go away.’

43:50.549 --> 43:56.690
He did all kinds of tricks to show that He
was really powerful.

43:56.690 --> 44:04.119
In so many ways of His sense of responsibility
and His dedication and love is expressed.

44:04.119 --> 44:14.089
But they say that even if you take once His
name, whatever work you want to do, it can

44:14.089 --> 44:15.089
be done.

44:15.089 --> 44:21.160
Any work that you want to be finished will
be done and His day is a Tuesday.

44:21.160 --> 44:24.859
On Tuesday, if you request Him for anything,
He will help you to do the work.

44:24.859 --> 44:29.171
But it is not like this that you sit down
and say now come along Hanumana, will you

44:29.171 --> 44:31.510
please do this job?

44:31.510 --> 44:35.940
But if you are doing the job, then He comes
to help you.

44:35.940 --> 44:44.980
Means that He activates, He activates and
He makes your energy flow into that direction

44:44.980 --> 44:48.559
that your work is done.

44:48.559 --> 44:49.559
He’s so helpful in so many ways that you
can’t imagine.

44:49.559 --> 44:57.210
There are so many sahaja yogis have tried
it with that and He has created such miracles

44:57.210 --> 44:58.950
especially the Australians.

44:58.950 --> 45:00.499
Somehow they have such a feeling for him.

45:00.499 --> 45:02.210
I know the reason.

45:02.210 --> 45:06.420
But they have such a feeling for Him that
every time anything happens, better ask Hanumana.

45:06.420 --> 45:07.450
They ask Hanumana.

45:07.450 --> 45:09.510
“Hanumana, now please look after us”.

45:09.510 --> 45:13.849
And they have told Me that such miraculous
things have happened since they have been

45:13.849 --> 45:15.039
using Shri Hanumana.

45:15.039 --> 45:18.670
But you must have the vehicle to carry this
Hanumana.

45:18.670 --> 45:20.869
He’s a very subtle Deity within you.

45:20.869 --> 45:27.299
And if you are irresponsible, He hates such
a person.

45:27.299 --> 45:30.530
He hates, He just can’t bear it.

45:30.530 --> 45:34.839
He, He thinks they are absolutely useless
people.

45:34.839 --> 45:38.849
He doesn’t pay attention to such people.

45:38.849 --> 45:43.829
Those who are not responsible, they may give
any excuses, they may show off, they may do

45:43.829 --> 45:44.829
anything.

45:44.829 --> 45:45.829
He just has no care for such people.

45:45.829 --> 45:50.349
He has no love, no respect, no attention for
the people who are not responsible.

45:50.349 --> 45:52.710
There’s a very nice English saying: ‘God
helps those who help themselves’.

45:52.710 --> 45:57.460
English language has so many beautiful things
in it, all these nursery rhymes and everything.

45:57.460 --> 46:00.660
I wish people would not just utter those sayings
but do it.

46:00.660 --> 46:03.769
They listen to Me but they don’t do it.

46:03.769 --> 46:09.580
Now you have heard Me today you should see
how much responsible you are.

46:09.580 --> 46:15.240
Now we had our first ashram and if there are
others, please excuse Me, because it is an

46:15.240 --> 46:18.109
open thing and we have to talk about it.

46:18.109 --> 46:23.029
And I was surprised that in our first ashram,
when I went there, I was amazed.

46:23.029 --> 46:27.769
I mean, young people living like pigs.

46:27.769 --> 46:28.769
I couldn’t understand.

46:28.769 --> 46:34.200
I mean, they are not hippies, they are not
taking any smokes, drinks, or anything.

46:34.200 --> 46:36.119
They are so irresponsible!

46:36.119 --> 46:43.180
They go to the bathroom, they come out as
if a bull in a china shop has entered.

46:43.180 --> 46:45.549
They really live like that, I was amazed.

46:45.549 --> 46:46.549
How could they?

46:46.549 --> 46:48.369
And we are all graduates, PhDs, MADs, and
everything.

46:48.369 --> 46:50.450
I was amazed, what has happened to these people.

46:50.450 --> 46:51.450
Slowly, slowly they improve.

46:51.450 --> 47:00.010
But this lot went away and a new lot came
in and a new lot came in.

47:00.010 --> 47:05.960
And it’s so surprising that once they become
responsible and good, somehow or other Hanumana

47:05.960 --> 47:07.299
takes them out.

47:07.299 --> 47:09.970
They just get out of it.

47:09.970 --> 47:20.259
Now I have to tell you to determine today
to decide that every moment and movement of

47:20.259 --> 47:24.700
your life you are going to feel responsible
as Hanumana does.

47:24.700 --> 47:33.550
Any work that you are doing, about Him it
is said, [sentence maybe in Hindi ??]. It

47:33.550 --> 47:39.980
means for doing any work, He is just ready,
He is just ready.

47:39.980 --> 47:45.759
You tell him anything, He is just ready to
do it.

47:45.759 --> 47:52.730
It is His quality that you should have and
that quality is so much lacking today in England.

47:52.730 --> 47:57.829
All your strikes, all your problems can be
solved.

47:57.829 --> 48:01.359
First time when I came, I was surprised, I
asked somebody: ‘Are you working?’

48:01.359 --> 48:04.029
He said: ‘No, I am successfully unemployed.’

48:04.029 --> 48:11.259
I said: ‘Really, you are successfully unemployed
so how do you eat?’

48:11.259 --> 48:13.609
‘Oh, we get our doles.’

48:13.609 --> 48:14.609
‘Oh really.’

48:14.609 --> 48:16.680
‘We have securities.’

48:16.680 --> 48:17.980
What are securities, this is nonsense, you
are parasite.

48:17.980 --> 48:18.980
There is no self-respect.

48:18.980 --> 48:24.240
Leave alone the respect … [??], there is
no self-respect.

48:24.240 --> 48:33.069
I was amazed when I told them, all of you
have to take to work.

48:33.069 --> 48:39.170
Anybody you takes the dole is not going to
stay in the ashram.

48:39.170 --> 48:43.150
I wish your government would take some note
of it.

48:43.150 --> 48:45.450
That we have to create responsible citizens.

48:45.450 --> 48:51.289
In England itself, we have to show that by
Sahaja Yoga you have turned the tables, you

48:51.289 --> 48:57.940
have got smart people, now efficient, responsible.

48:57.940 --> 49:00.010
This is what we have to show.

49:00.010 --> 49:01.920
Once we show this to others, people will be
amazed.

49:01.920 --> 49:07.539
With other’s money, it’s the same.

49:07.539 --> 49:09.070
If you can get hold of somebody else’s money
that’s the best thing.

49:09.070 --> 49:11.569
This is a very common feature.

49:11.569 --> 49:21.210
First time the sahaja yogis went to India
they came back here, they never wrote a letter

49:21.210 --> 49:22.589
back thanking them.

49:22.589 --> 49:23.970
And I was amazed.

49:23.970 --> 49:25.560
For six months, I said: ‘What are you doing?’

49:25.560 --> 49:27.619
‘I know we should have written.

49:27.619 --> 49:31.140
I know we should have written.’

49:31.140 --> 49:34.660
But why, why didn’t you write?

49:34.660 --> 49:35.829
No responsibility.

49:35.829 --> 49:39.009
What is this, I could not understand.

49:39.009 --> 49:44.819
Gradually they developed and developed and
developed now they feel but those who have

49:44.819 --> 49:47.180
started feeling are the matured sahaja yogis
I should say.

49:47.180 --> 49:53.069
But others who are coming to it must now that
you have to have a sense of responsibility.

49:53.069 --> 49:56.510
Sometimes people who are realised have a feeling:
‘Oh, now we are realised.

49:56.510 --> 50:00.710
Now, nothing, settle down, have the bliss
of Mother.

50:00.710 --> 50:03.410
Sit down and enjoy it, nothing doing, it will
stop!’

50:03.410 --> 50:08.950
You have to be able to give this to others.

50:08.950 --> 50:14.330
You should emit, if you cannot emit those
vibrations yourself.

50:14.330 --> 50:18.190
If you are enlightened, you should be able
to give light to others.

50:18.190 --> 50:23.890
You can raise the Kundalini, alright but what
about your own personality.

50:23.890 --> 50:29.089
It is so irresponsible which is no where near
Hanumana’s.

50:29.089 --> 50:42.050
This Hanumana style of complete obedience
to your being, the complete emission of that

50:42.050 --> 50:45.950
love that you have received, that divine power
you have received.

50:45.950 --> 50:52.849
Unless and until you achieve that state you
should not be satisfied with your self-realisation.

50:52.849 --> 51:02.400
Self-realisation is only complete when you
yourself become the giver of light.

51:02.400 --> 51:06.940
You the guru, you the great stars.

51:06.940 --> 51:09.380
That’s My ambition.

51:09.380 --> 51:22.309
I know I expect sometimes from My children
and I want them to understand that I want

51:22.309 --> 51:41.529
you to be really honoured in the Kingdom of
God as great sons of your Mother.

51:41.529 --> 51:47.170
May God bless you.

51:47.170 --> 51:54.480
You know that but keep it up.

51:54.480 --> 52:03.759
I do encourage you by saying all these things.

52:03.759 --> 52:10.880
I do awaken Hanumana and Shri Rama within
you.

52:10.880 --> 52:16.230
No doubt, I know, but keep them awake.

52:16.230 --> 52:43.230
Keep them alert and you have to
be alert and active, responsible and respectable.

52:43.230 --> 53:09.519
You have to realise that
you are saints.

53:09.519 --> 53:19.910
Saints of a very special quality.

53:19.910 --> 53:35.039
The saints who can give realisations to others.

53:35.039 --> 53:52.460
There have been not such things like this
before.

53:52.460 --> 54:39.119
Nor even today there are saints who

54:39.119 --> 54:57.200
are realised souls but they don’t know how
to give realisation.

54:57.200 --> 55:12.720
They don’t know so much.

55:12.720 --> 55:28.599
You have so much of knowledge and everything.

55:28.599 --> 55:40.099
Except the vehicle is poor.

55:40.099 --> 55:49.220
It cannot carry the bliss.

55:49.220 --> 56:00.099
The cup has to be alright.

56:00.099 --> 56:16.729
Otherwise it cannot carry the beautiful fountain
of love that is pouring down on this earth.

56:16.729 --> 56:38.640
And that is how you must know that within
you this is awakened, keep it awakened, keep

56:38.640 --> 56:47.829
it … (vague ?).
Please close your eyes.

56:47.829 --> 56:53.950
