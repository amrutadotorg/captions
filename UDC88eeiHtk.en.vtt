00:08.150 --> 00:17.087
In the nature, if you see, everything circulates in a very regular manner.

00:17.288 --> 00:23.390
For example in the winter time the leaves have to fall down,

00:23.591 --> 00:32.461
because the nitrogen of the leaves
has to go into the Mother Earth to nourish the trees.

00:32.630 --> 00:40.851
Moreover the Mother Earth must get sun’s rays.

00:41.052 --> 00:47.408
so there should be no leaves and the sun’s rays can penetrate

00:47.609 --> 00:51.384
into the Mother Earth to nourish her.

00:52.575 --> 01:02.673
Then the trees when they are nourished
they again become green and lush

01:02.874 --> 01:13.265
so that they receive the sun’s light and make chlorophyll out of them.

01:14.934 --> 01:24.443
Also they suck in the water from the Mother Earth
and throw them in the atmosphere

01:24.620 --> 01:30.045
to act as catalyst for the rain to come.

01:30.246 --> 01:33.358
Then the rain comes during the rainy season,

01:33.559 --> 01:45.508
then again nourished with water the life again [starts].

01:45.709 --> 01:52.389
They lose all their leaves and the whole circle
goes on in a beautiful manner.

01:52.590 --> 01:56.974
There is no reversion, it is just a continuous circle

01:57.175 --> 02:03.742
going in a very beautiful manner to create and recreate.

02:05.862 --> 02:14.977
But with the interference of man nature gets disturbed.

02:15.178 --> 02:20.812
Also you can enhance the nature,

02:21.177 --> 02:27.916
you can save the nature’s destruction which could be natural also.

02:29.676 --> 02:37.036
But when you get your realisation, when you get your realisation,

02:37.237 --> 02:43.816
then with your vibrations you can save all natural things

02:44.017 --> 02:49.237
that are decaying under the modern influence.

02:49.491 --> 02:56.128
So first of all, we see the effect of realisation

02:56.329 --> 03:01.315
how it acts as Ekadasha Rudra.

03:01.516 --> 03:12.722
It destroys the negative forces which are trying to destroy the nature.

03:15.925 --> 03:20.836
One day I am sure you all will evolve to such a state

03:21.037 --> 03:29.362
that even your glance is sufficient to make the trees grow,

03:29.563 --> 03:37.384
to make the fruits sweet, to make the flowers fragrant.

03:38.201 --> 03:45.966
That’s possible because our growth is showing results.

03:46.167 --> 03:49.349
Slowly, slowly it is showing results,

03:49.550 --> 03:53.064
because you should not be stunned, you should not be shocked,

03:53.281 --> 04:00.320
so that you can see for yourself
what you are and what you are achieving.

04:02.642 --> 04:06.749
But to allow this force within us to grow,

04:06.950 --> 04:12.066
first of all, we should be very introspective,

04:12.313 --> 04:19.309
we should try to see ourselves, what is happening to us?

04:19.510 --> 04:21.909
We must watch our steps.

04:22.152 --> 04:29.665
Are we moving towards our construction
or towards our destruction?

04:29.866 --> 04:32.717
What are we doing?
