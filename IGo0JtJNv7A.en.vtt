00:00:01.221 --> 00:00:07.371
(I never expected) all of you to be here
present for the puja.

00:00:10.698 --> 00:00:16.547
I don't know how you all have managed
to come.

00:00:34.722 --> 00:00:41.250
Otherwise, it's a very important day today
for all of us

00:00:42.161 --> 00:00:45.096
because you know

00:00:47.682 --> 00:00:53.319
how Christ died. He was crucified.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:59.352
He was put on the cross and then He died.

00:01:01.476 --> 00:01:06.443
Wonderful the way He said

00:01:11.302 --> 00:01:16.402
about you people.

00:01:17.835 --> 00:01:23.229
He asked for forgiveness from God.

00:01:23.693 --> 00:01:29.623
What we have to learn from His life is

00:01:30.074 --> 00:01:35.710
the way He knew how to forgive all of us.

00:01:38.104 --> 00:01:41.275
We have to also forgive people.

00:01:41.476 --> 00:01:47.062
That seems to be very difficult for people
to forgive.

00:01:47.263 --> 00:01:54.715
And if they are angry, they are angry,

00:01:55.052 --> 00:02:02.138
they cannot forgive. Then you are no more
sahaja yogis.

00:02:02.339 --> 00:02:08.611
Sahaja yogis must forgive, it's very
important

00:02:09.242 --> 00:02:16.220
because that is the power you have got
from Christ: to forgive.

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:29.187
Human beings make mistakes; that is
a part of their life.

00:02:29.388 --> 00:02:37.722
But at the same time, as sahaja yogis you
must remember that you have to forgive.

00:02:37.923 --> 00:02:43.633
That is much more important than getting
angry.

00:02:44.205 --> 00:02:51.969
So to forgive people for doing something
wrong according to you

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:57.502
or according to God, you have to forgive.

00:02:57.939 --> 00:03:03.967
And you will be surprised that
the forgiveness

00:03:04.168 --> 00:03:10.615
is such a great, satisfying quality.

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.918
If you can forgive people,

00:03:16.822 --> 00:03:23.240
you will become extremely pure

00:03:25.067 --> 00:03:35.948
because the dirt or the anger that is
within us goes out.

00:03:36.724 --> 00:03:45.261
So to forgive is the biggest blessings
human beings have.

00:03:47.334 --> 00:03:50.754
Even Christ said the same thing

00:03:51.292 --> 00:03:55.596
that, "Forgive them because they don't
know what they are doing."

00:03:55.797 --> 00:04:01.229
So if Christ had to say, so what about you?

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:08.823
We are ordinary human beings and if we
have done mistakes,

00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:14.626
people can get angry and upset with you.

00:04:15.042 --> 00:04:20.130
But the best thing for you is to forgive.

00:04:20.422 --> 00:04:27.393
Forgive for doing something that should
not have been done.

00:04:27.762 --> 00:04:36.235
This was the biggest quality of Christ:
that He knew how to forgive.

00:04:36.521 --> 00:04:43.950
And He forgave people who had made
horrible mistakes.

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:52.410
Still He forgave them because He loved
them.

00:04:53.454 --> 00:05:00.537
And that is what you should also forgive.

00:05:01.032 --> 00:05:07.986
Today is a special day for that -
special day for forgiveness.

00:05:09.589 --> 00:05:15.137
And that is why I said, whatever you may
think,

00:05:15.367 --> 00:05:24.668
it's very late, but we'll have a meeting
because I didn't want to miss the time.

00:05:29.008 --> 00:05:38.726
Forgiveness comes by people who are
very generous, who are good-hearted.

00:05:41.075 --> 00:05:47.771
You, everybody makes mistakes and so
we can also make mistakes.

00:05:48.152 --> 00:05:53.467
But that means we have a right to forgive

00:05:53.668 --> 00:05:58.609
and we have a heart to forgive.

00:05:59.371 --> 00:06:03.091
If you don't have, then we are not
sahaja yogis.

00:06:03.789 --> 00:06:13.398
We must learn to forgive and forgive
without any remarks behind it.

00:06:16.032 --> 00:06:23.420
Today is a very special day because
that's what Christ did.

00:06:23.689 --> 00:06:35.335
He was one of the most powerful deities
or gods as we may say, most powerful.

00:06:35.536 --> 00:06:46.020
He could do anything; He could punish them,
all of them, for misbehaving.

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:54.108
But what did He say? He said, "I forgive"

00:06:54.309 --> 00:06:58.002
and He asked God also to forgive.

00:06:59.001 --> 00:07:05.824
So whatever may be your powers,

00:07:06.025 --> 00:07:11.675
whatever you might have achieved
in your life,

00:07:11.913 --> 00:07:16.085
whatever position you might be occupying,

00:07:16.286 --> 00:07:22.394
but you must learn the way to forgive.

00:07:22.595 --> 00:07:26.446
Otherwise you are nowhere near Christ.

00:07:26.647 --> 00:07:32.603
You must learn to forgive; that's a very
great quality

00:07:32.804 --> 00:07:38.356
if you can forgive, all the time forgive.

00:07:38.557 --> 00:07:46.281
And that's why today I wanted to meet
you all, so I did.

00:07:47.778 --> 00:07:52.977
I wanted to meet you all and tell you

00:07:53.178 --> 00:08:00.891
that today is a day to forgive.

00:08:01.092 --> 00:08:10.218
That doesn't mean you sit down and think,
oh, how many people you have to forgive.

00:08:11.553 --> 00:08:14.861
That would be absurd.

00:08:16.663 --> 00:08:21.418
But something that haunts your mind

00:08:26.938 --> 00:08:36.250
and you think you all been troubled and you
have been put to trouble.

00:08:36.695 --> 00:08:44.375
Then just think that you don't know
how many powers you have

00:08:44.576 --> 00:08:51.167
and you can't even forgive. When you have
got all these powers;

00:08:51.368 --> 00:08:56.200
the greatest power you have got is
to forgive.

00:08:56.785 --> 00:09:01.911
And today is the day for forgiving,

00:09:02.293 --> 00:09:08.847
forgiving people whom you think they have
done wrong to you,

00:09:09.048 --> 00:09:17.823
or they have been unkind to you. Please
try to remember

00:09:20.038 --> 00:09:24.698
how many you are still angry.

00:09:25.118 --> 00:09:29.822
Just forgive them. Then you have punished
them.

00:09:30.023 --> 00:09:36.466
If you forgive them from your heart,
then you have punished them.

00:09:36.667 --> 00:09:44.285
You have given them back, whatever they
wanted, they deserved.

00:09:44.486 --> 00:09:51.805
So this is not a very difficult thing,
to forgive,

00:09:52.006 --> 00:09:56.061
but people think it's very difficult
to forgive

00:09:56.262 --> 00:10:02.812
because they have certain great
understandings about themselves.

00:10:03.013 --> 00:10:10.215
And then they think how can they forgive?

00:10:12.571 --> 00:10:19.043
I don't know what things upset you,
anything can upset you.

00:10:19.244 --> 00:10:27.387
After all, you are all realized souls,
you have got your second birth

00:10:27.588 --> 00:10:34.522
and you are special people. So you should
have a special quality.

00:10:34.723 --> 00:10:43.050
And the special quality is to forgive,
to forgive.

00:10:43.251 --> 00:10:51.517
Not to go on remembering on what things you
should be angry and you should be upset.

00:10:51.718 --> 00:10:59.880
But just to remember what things you have
to forgive. Just forgive.

00:11:00.081 --> 00:11:02.669
For what?

00:11:05.906 --> 00:11:13.843
Is a practical thing, most practical.

00:11:14.168 --> 00:11:20.076
Supposing somebody slaps me, alright.

00:11:21.258 --> 00:11:26.616
If somebody slaps me, what should I do?

00:11:26.817 --> 00:11:31.671
I should slap him back? No.

00:11:31.872 --> 00:11:39.971
Then why should I ask him, "Why did you
slap me?" No.

00:11:40.963 --> 00:11:47.579
Then I should think he must be stupid fool
to do like that?

00:11:48.273 --> 00:11:58.285
Even that won't help. On the contrary,
if you can just forgive,

00:11:58.793 --> 00:12:07.220
forgive that person who has done something
wrong...

00:12:09.542 --> 00:12:20.306
For you it is important that you must
forgive because has no effect.

00:12:20.507 --> 00:12:32.372
Once you forgive, it will have more effect
on you, your goodness, your righteousness.

00:12:33.015 --> 00:12:43.079
But I think human beings find it difficult
to forgive normally. Normally.

00:12:45.911 --> 00:12:53.700
But you are all realized souls; you are
not only human beings.

00:12:53.901 --> 00:13:02.328
That's why I'm requesting you that
remember you have a power to forgive.

00:13:02.868 --> 00:13:08.026
To forgive everyone who hurts you,

00:13:08.269 --> 00:13:16.173
who tortures you, who troubles you.
How far can he go?

00:13:16.374 --> 00:13:26.209
Just think of forgiving him and you'll be
amazed, he will change.

00:13:27.422 --> 00:13:35.380
He will change and you will also enjoy
yourself.

00:13:36.352 --> 00:13:44.222
It's a difficult thing for people
to understand, but just try.

00:13:44.423 --> 00:13:50.611
Just try what I'm saying. If somebody does
any harm to you,

00:13:50.812 --> 00:13:56.325
just forgive that person and see
the reaction,

00:13:56.526 --> 00:14:03.583
reaction in that person and in yourself.
What happens?

00:14:03.784 --> 00:14:11.874
But if you want to carry the burden of his
anger or of stupidity, whatever it is,

00:14:12.075 --> 00:14:19.710
then you are unnecessarily loaded
with useless things.

00:14:19.911 --> 00:14:28.749
We should not waste our energy
on deciding

00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:37.885
what's wrong, what did he do and what you
should do to him, that we should not.

00:14:38.138 --> 00:14:48.428
Just leave him alone and you just forgive.
Say that, "I forgive."

00:14:48.629 --> 00:14:56.332
Look at Christ. Such a powerful person;
such a powerful god!

00:14:56.533 --> 00:15:02.203
And when He was crucified,

00:15:02.404 --> 00:15:08.533
how He asked for forgiveness for them.

00:15:08.842 --> 00:15:15.125
Why did He do it? Because that has power.

00:15:17.222 --> 00:15:24.073
Saying, "Pa, forgive", it's very powerful.

00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:31.363
You don't lose your power, but
on the contrary,

00:15:31.564 --> 00:15:38.260
you go higher in your power.

00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:44.224
You go higher in your personality.

00:15:44.425 --> 00:15:49.658
Just forgive. As simple as that.

00:15:49.859 --> 00:15:57.019
To say that, "I forgive," just like that.

00:15:57.262 --> 00:16:09.138
That's how I do because people have
their own whims

00:16:09.362 --> 00:16:17.315
and they do whatever they like, but I don't
get angry on that point.

00:16:17.569 --> 00:16:24.043
And I'm not upset on that point,
neither I am concerned.

00:16:24.244 --> 00:16:30.761
I just say, "I forgive," that's all.

00:16:30.962 --> 00:16:41.685
And you'll be amazed, within myself,
it so helps so much, really very helpful.

00:16:41.917 --> 00:16:52.926
So this is a very big quality for which
today is a special day.

00:16:53.626 --> 00:16:59.824
On the cross Christ said that, "Oh God,
forgive them because they don't know

00:17:00.073 --> 00:17:10.536
what they are doing." On the cross
where He was dying He said this,

00:17:11.612 --> 00:17:17.887
and what we have to learn is to forgive,

00:17:18.088 --> 00:17:26.502
for our sake, not for others. This
helps us. If we forgive,

00:17:26.703 --> 00:17:31.882
this will help us very much within
ourselves.

00:17:32.083 --> 00:17:39.845
This is the message for today and
permanently. Permanently.

00:17:40.371 --> 00:17:48.789
Always, if you are angry with anyone,
just say, "I forgive."

00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:56.967
If you find somebody hurting you
or troubling you or torturing you,

00:17:57.168 --> 00:18:05.256
how you will overcome it? Just forgive,
just forgive. This is the only way.

00:18:05.457 --> 00:18:11.559
Today that's why is very important day
for us and I'm so very happy

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:17.827
there are so wonderful Sahajis here and
then I can speak to you.

00:18:18.754 --> 00:18:21.106
Thank you.
