00:01.221 --> 00:07.371
(I never expected) all of you to be here
present for the puja.

00:10.698 --> 00:16.547
I don't know how you all have managed
to come.

00:34.722 --> 00:41.250
Otherwise, it's a very important day today
for all of us

00:42.161 --> 00:45.096
because you know

00:47.682 --> 00:53.319
how Christ died. He was crucified.

00:53.700 --> 00:59.352
He was put on the cross and then He died.

01:01.476 --> 01:06.443
Wonderful the way He said

01:11.302 --> 01:16.402
about you people.

01:17.835 --> 01:23.229
He asked for forgiveness from God.

01:23.693 --> 01:29.623
What we have to learn from His life is

01:30.074 --> 01:35.710
the way He knew how to forgive all of us.

01:38.104 --> 01:41.275
We have to also forgive people.

01:41.476 --> 01:47.062
That seems to be very difficult for people
to forgive.

01:47.263 --> 01:54.715
And if they are angry, they are angry,

01:55.052 --> 02:02.138
they cannot forgive. Then you are no more
sahaja yogis.

02:02.339 --> 02:08.611
Sahaja yogis must forgive, it's very
important

02:09.242 --> 02:16.220
because that is the power you have got
from Christ: to forgive.

02:20.170 --> 02:29.187
Human beings make mistakes; that is
a part of their life.

02:29.388 --> 02:37.722
But at the same time, as sahaja yogis you
must remember that you have to forgive.

02:37.923 --> 02:43.633
That is much more important than getting
angry.

02:44.205 --> 02:51.969
So to forgive people for doing something
wrong according to you

02:52.170 --> 02:57.502
or according to God, you have to forgive.

02:57.939 --> 03:03.967
And you will be surprised that
the forgiveness

03:04.168 --> 03:10.615
is such a great, satisfying quality.

03:11.330 --> 03:14.918
If you can forgive people,

03:16.822 --> 03:23.240
you will become extremely pure

03:25.067 --> 03:35.948
because the dirt or the anger that is
within us goes out.

03:36.724 --> 03:45.261
So to forgive is the biggest blessings
human beings have.

03:47.334 --> 03:50.754
Even Christ said the same thing

03:51.292 --> 03:55.596
that, "Forgive them because they don't
know what they are doing."

03:55.797 --> 04:01.229
So if Christ had to say, so what about you?

04:01.430 --> 04:08.823
We are ordinary human beings and if we
have done mistakes,

04:09.839 --> 04:14.626
people can get angry and upset with you.

04:15.042 --> 04:20.130
But the best thing for you is to forgive.

04:20.422 --> 04:27.393
Forgive for doing something that should
not have been done.

04:27.762 --> 04:36.235
This was the biggest quality of Christ:
that He knew how to forgive.

04:36.521 --> 04:43.950
And He forgave people who had made
horrible mistakes.

04:44.230 --> 04:52.410
Still He forgave them because He loved
them.

04:53.454 --> 05:00.537
And that is what you should also forgive.

05:01.032 --> 05:07.986
Today is a special day for that -
special day for forgiveness.

05:09.589 --> 05:15.137
And that is why I said, whatever you may
think,

05:15.367 --> 05:24.668
it's very late, but we'll have a meeting
because I didn't want to miss the time.

05:29.008 --> 05:38.726
Forgiveness comes by people who are
very generous, who are good-hearted.

05:41.075 --> 05:47.771
You, everybody makes mistakes and so
we can also make mistakes.

05:48.152 --> 05:53.467
But that means we have a right to forgive

05:53.668 --> 05:58.609
and we have a heart to forgive.

05:59.371 --> 06:03.091
If you don't have, then we are not
sahaja yogis.

06:03.789 --> 06:13.398
We must learn to forgive and forgive
without any remarks behind it.

06:16.032 --> 06:23.420
Today is a very special day because
that's what Christ did.

06:23.689 --> 06:35.335
He was one of the most powerful deities
or gods as we may say, most powerful.

06:35.536 --> 06:46.020
He could do anything; He could punish them,
all of them, for misbehaving.

06:47.770 --> 06:54.108
But what did He say? He said, "I forgive"

06:54.309 --> 06:58.002
and He asked God also to forgive.

06:59.001 --> 07:05.824
So whatever may be your powers,

07:06.025 --> 07:11.675
whatever you might have achieved
in your life,

07:11.913 --> 07:16.085
whatever position you might be occupying,

07:16.286 --> 07:22.394
but you must learn the way to forgive.

07:22.595 --> 07:26.446
Otherwise you are nowhere near Christ.

07:26.647 --> 07:32.603
You must learn to forgive; that's a very
great quality

07:32.804 --> 07:38.356
if you can forgive, all the time forgive.

07:38.557 --> 07:46.281
And that's why today I wanted to meet
you all, so I did.

07:47.778 --> 07:52.977
I wanted to meet you all and tell you

07:53.178 --> 08:00.891
that today is a day to forgive.

08:01.092 --> 08:10.218
That doesn't mean you sit down and think,
oh, how many people you have to forgive.

08:11.553 --> 08:14.861
That would be absurd.

08:16.663 --> 08:21.418
But something that haunts your mind

08:26.938 --> 08:36.250
and you think you all been troubled and you
have been put to trouble.

08:36.695 --> 08:44.375
Then just think that you don't know
how many powers you have

08:44.576 --> 08:51.167
and you can't even forgive. When you have
got all these powers;

08:51.368 --> 08:56.200
the greatest power you have got is
to forgive.

08:56.785 --> 09:01.911
And today is the day for forgiving,

09:02.293 --> 09:08.847
forgiving people whom you think they have
done wrong to you,

09:09.048 --> 09:17.823
or they have been unkind to you. Please
try to remember

09:20.038 --> 09:24.698
how many you are still angry.

09:25.118 --> 09:29.822
Just forgive them. Then you have punished
them.

09:30.023 --> 09:36.466
If you forgive them from your heart,
then you have punished them.

09:36.667 --> 09:44.285
You have given them back, whatever they
wanted, they deserved.

09:44.486 --> 09:51.805
So this is not a very difficult thing,
to forgive,

09:52.006 --> 09:56.061
but people think it's very difficult
to forgive

09:56.262 --> 10:02.812
because they have certain great
understandings about themselves.

10:03.013 --> 10:10.215
And then they think how can they forgive?

10:12.571 --> 10:19.043
I don't know what things upset you,
anything can upset you.

10:19.244 --> 10:27.387
After all, you are all realized souls,
you have got your second birth

10:27.588 --> 10:34.522
and you are special people. So you should
have a special quality.

10:34.723 --> 10:43.050
And the special quality is to forgive,
to forgive.

10:43.251 --> 10:51.517
Not to go on remembering on what things you
should be angry and you should be upset.

10:51.718 --> 10:59.880
But just to remember what things you have
to forgive. Just forgive.

11:00.081 --> 11:02.669
For what?

11:05.906 --> 11:13.843
Is a practical thing, most practical.

11:14.168 --> 11:20.076
Supposing somebody slaps me, alright.

11:21.258 --> 11:26.616
If somebody slaps me, what should I do?

11:26.817 --> 11:31.671
I should slap him back? No.

11:31.872 --> 11:39.971
Then why should I ask him, "Why did you
slap me?" No.

11:40.963 --> 11:47.579
Then I should think he must be stupid fool
to do like that?

11:48.273 --> 11:58.285
Even that won't help. On the contrary,
if you can just forgive,

11:58.793 --> 12:07.220
forgive that person who has done something
wrong...

12:09.542 --> 12:20.306
For you it is important that you must
forgive because has no effect.

12:20.507 --> 12:32.372
Once you forgive, it will have more effect
on you, your goodness, your righteousness.

12:33.015 --> 12:43.079
But I think human beings find it difficult
to forgive normally. Normally.

12:45.911 --> 12:53.700
But you are all realized souls; you are
not only human beings.

12:53.901 --> 13:02.328
That's why I'm requesting you that
remember you have a power to forgive.

13:02.868 --> 13:08.026
To forgive everyone who hurts you,

13:08.269 --> 13:16.173
who tortures you, who troubles you.
How far can he go?

13:16.374 --> 13:26.209
Just think of forgiving him and you'll be
amazed, he will change.

13:27.422 --> 13:35.380
He will change and you will also enjoy
yourself.

13:36.352 --> 13:44.222
It's a difficult thing for people
to understand, but just try.

13:44.423 --> 13:50.611
Just try what I'm saying. If somebody does
any harm to you,

13:50.812 --> 13:56.325
just forgive that person and see
the reaction,

13:56.526 --> 14:03.583
reaction in that person and in yourself.
What happens?

14:03.784 --> 14:11.874
But if you want to carry the burden of his
anger or of stupidity, whatever it is,

14:12.075 --> 14:19.710
then you are unnecessarily loaded
with useless things.

14:19.911 --> 14:28.749
We should not waste our energy
on deciding

14:28.950 --> 14:37.885
what's wrong, what did he do and what you
should do to him, that we should not.

14:38.138 --> 14:48.428
Just leave him alone and you just forgive.
Say that, "I forgive."

14:48.629 --> 14:56.332
Look at Christ. Such a powerful person;
such a powerful god!

14:56.533 --> 15:02.203
And when He was crucified,

15:02.404 --> 15:08.533
how He asked for forgiveness for them.

15:08.842 --> 15:15.125
Why did He do it? Because that has power.

15:17.222 --> 15:24.073
Saying, "I forgive", it's very powerful.

15:24.690 --> 15:31.363
You don't lose your power, but
on the contrary,

15:31.564 --> 15:38.260
you go higher in your power.

15:39.400 --> 15:44.224
You go higher in your personality.

15:44.425 --> 15:49.658
Just forgive. As simple as that.

15:49.859 --> 15:57.019
To say that, "I forgive," just like that.

15:57.262 --> 16:09.138
That's how I do because people have
their own whims

16:09.362 --> 16:17.315
and they do whatever they like, but I don't
get angry on that point.

16:17.569 --> 16:24.043
And I'm not upset on that point,
neither I am concerned.

16:24.244 --> 16:30.761
I just say, "I forgive," that's all.

16:30.962 --> 16:41.685
And you'll be amazed, within myself,
it so helps so much, really very helpful.

16:41.917 --> 16:52.926
So this is a very big quality for which
today is a special day.

16:53.626 --> 16:59.824
On the cross Christ said that, "Oh God,
forgive them because they don't know

17:00.073 --> 17:10.536
what they are doing." On the cross
where He was dying He said this,

17:11.612 --> 17:17.887
and what we have to learn is to forgive,

17:18.088 --> 17:26.502
for our sake, not for others. This
helps us. If we forgive,

17:26.703 --> 17:31.882
this will help us very much within
ourselves.

17:32.083 --> 17:39.845
This is the message for today and
permanently. Permanently.

17:40.371 --> 17:48.789
Always, if you are angry with anyone,
just say, "I forgive."

17:48.990 --> 17:56.967
If you find somebody hurting you
or troubling you or torturing you,

17:57.168 --> 18:05.256
how you will work on it? Just forgive,
just forgive. This is the only way.

18:05.457 --> 18:11.559
Today that's why is very important day
for us and I'm so very happy

18:11.760 --> 18:17.827
there‘s a wonderful site here and
then I can speak to you.

18:18.754 --> 18:21.106
Thank you.
