00:00:00,041 --> 00:00:00,417
Diwali Puja, Los Angeles, USA November 18, 2001

2
00:00:01,166 --> 00:00:04,166
It’s a very, very great day today, I should say,

3
00:00:06,041 --> 00:00:12,250
where the evil has been suppressed.

4
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:52,083
The evil that spreads its power all over

5
00:00:53,041 --> 00:00:57,333
is only because of two factors.

6
00:00:59,041 --> 00:01:05,166
One is that you are not knowledgeable,

7
00:01:07,166 --> 00:01:10,083
you are still blind,

8
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:15,375
and you follow things

9
00:01:16,208 --> 00:01:19,125
which are not right but you think are powerful.

10
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,041
This illusion creates not only problems,

11
00:01:30,166 --> 00:01:34,375
but absolute destruction.

12
00:01:37,417 --> 00:01:41,291
So we faced a very big challenge, no doubt

13
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:50,166
and it was easily solved.

14
00:01:55,041 --> 00:01:58,125
It was based on all wrong basis,

15
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:02,166
just to create a problem.

16
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:10,333
Problem was created with a purpose,

17
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:19,208
and nobody could imagine

18
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:25,417
that it would be solved so easily and so quickly.

19
00:02:27,417 --> 00:02:33,375
My desire was to get over it before Diwali that has happened.

20
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:59,041
Due to ignorance also, people do lots of things.

21
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:04,166
Anybody who follows some religion or some sort of a thing,

22
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:10,166
it’s only because they’re not aware of the truth,

23
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:15,166
they’re ignorant about achieving the truth,

24
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:20,166
and they cling on to the fact

25
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:24,041
that they know everything.

26
00:03:24,417 --> 00:03:27,250
With all this happening,

27
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:31,000
there have been so many fractions,

28
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:33,375
so many stupid people

29
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:42,041
who are getting completely ruined by ignorance.

30
00:03:44,417 --> 00:03:47,166
Now that we’re coming to Sahaja Yoga,

31
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:54,041
you know all the knowledge – very subtle knowledge,

32
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:59,333
very subtle. It’s not superficial knowledge,

33
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:02,208
it is very subtle.

34
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:06,417
And because they don’t know this subtle knowledge,

35
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:11,333
they fall into the wrong path of,

36
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:17,166
I should say, ignorance and then they try to oppose

37
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:20,000
the people who are doing good.

38
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,041
But above all is the power of God.

39
00:04:27,417 --> 00:04:33,083
All this drama is played to prove the existence

40
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:35,250
of that great Power.

41
00:04:36,417 --> 00:04:39,291
It has all worked out so well,

42
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:42,375
and for all of you Sahaja yogis

43
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:48,000
it’s a very great achievement that you can see the play.

44
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:52,333
Many people who have achieved

45
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:55,333
so-called success cannot see that point,

46
00:04:56,375 --> 00:05:01,041
but you can see it because you are spectators.

47
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:08,000
Though all the world is a part and parcel of that drama,

48
00:05:08,417 --> 00:05:11,333
you are outside and you can see it so clearly.

49
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:16,458
Whatever has happened, nobody could have believed

50
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:19,458
that would finish before Diwali.

51
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:24,125
So it goes like this, the stupidity

52
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:27,208
which is being created;

53
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:31,500
and we also sometimes think that this kind of stupid thing

54
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:36,417
will impress others. Impression is not the point.

55
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:43,041
If you see among all these people who have lost,

56
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:47,166
what impression have they created?

57
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:51,208
They were there to create a great impression on everyone,

58
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:57,083
to show as if they were great warriors and fighters.

59
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:01,500
But what impression they have created?

60
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:05,208
Whether you are a realized soul or not,

61
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:11,083
they can see that it’s a miracle,

62
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:15,333
it’s a miracle how things have worked out.

63
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:26,166
Now the new phase has started.

64
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:35,166
You all have a very, very open challenge

65
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:39,375
to get people into enlightenment.

66
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:44,458
People are not so ignorant now,

67
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:47,333
they are not so much blasted.

68
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:52,166
Moreover, I find them very much changed.

69
00:06:52,542 --> 00:06:59,041
Their attitude towards truth has changed,

70
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:01,333
and they understand

71
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:05,333
there is truth beyond all this that they have known.

72
00:07:06,417 --> 00:07:08,208
It’s very important,

73
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:15,041
because if a human being starts thinking

74
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:18,250
“this is the truth,” he just gets stuck up.

75
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:22,125
At any cost, whatever may happen,

76
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:25,458
he’ll go on sticking to that.

77
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:32,083
He won’t be able even to verify whether it is the truth or not.

78
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:38,417
Animals can. How? Because they have got innate capacity

79
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:44,417
to smell the evil – innate.

80
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:48,458
We cannot, human beings cannot.

81
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:52,500
If there’s a evil man, a dog will bark at him.

82
00:07:54,291 --> 00:08:00,166
Otherwise he’ll go and throw him down.

83
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:05,250
He’ll do everything which is not normally done.

84
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:12,458
How is it he has developed this capacity to find out

85
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:16,166
who is a thief and who is not?

86
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:20,458
We have a higher awareness.

87
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:26,041
We think about many things which animals cannot think.

88
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:32,375
We understand many things which animals cannot understand.

89
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,291
We cook our food – they don’t.

90
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:42,166
But also I sometimes, I think we cook our brains,

91
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:48,083
because the way people behave

92
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:55,000
and try to avoid the truth with their ego is surprising.

93
00:08:56,542 --> 00:08:58,417
All this happening

94
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:02,333
is a drama, as I told you, but you better study it  properly

95
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:05,542
and apply it to yourself, and see

96
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:09,375
if you are also a part and parcel of that drama.

97
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:14,458
For that, you have to rise higher.

98
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:18,166
You have to rise higher

99
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:25,083
– higher above your ego and your superego, your conditioning,

100
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:30,417
and from there to watch yourself and see yourself:

101
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:36,041
“What is this? Why am I doing such a thing?

102
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,166
Why my attention is like that?

103
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:42,083
What is the main reason

104
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:48,083
for my own

105
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:53,208
possession, I should say, or my own

106
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:59,417
misunderstandings? Why do I accept wrong things?”

107
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,250
Once you’ll start seeing that,

108
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:07,458
and if you find even a wee bit of such

109
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:11,000
nonsensical understanding within you,

110
00:10:11,417 --> 00:10:14,083
then you can forgive also people

111
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:18,125
who have been absolutely brainwashed,

112
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:21,542
absolutely brainwashed,

113
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:26,417
and they did everything under that influence.

114
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:33,333
As it is now you have risen much higher

115
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:37,041
than all these people,

116
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:44,125
and much more aware than all of them.

117
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:50,041
So you have to just understand this point,

118
00:10:50,417 --> 00:10:55,041
and then you can forgive all the mistakes they have committed.

119
00:10:58,208 --> 00:11:04,166
And for the people who are actually bad,

120
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:07,458
you don’t have to worry.

121
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:13,250
That’s the work of the divine Power to destroy them.

122
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:19,250
But watch yourself and see for yourself

123
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:26,458
if you have any of such ideas, any lingering idea.

124
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,375
You should try to cleanse the mirror

125
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:39,291
so you see your complete image

126
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,125
and try, you can then try to cleanse it.

127
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:54,208
It’s very important that you should cleanse yourself.

128
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:06,333
There are people who have done lots of wrong things.

129
00:12:07,417 --> 00:12:10,000
I simply pity them.

130
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:15,542
If they have done wrong things, it is their responsibility

131
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:18,166
to see what they have been doing.

132
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,333
Why have they been doing like that?

133
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:24,375
What is the need to do that?

134
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:33,542
All this introspection will work out so well.

135
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:37,291
Then your real powers will come out

136
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:45,250
– your powers of giving realization,

137
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:54,166
your powers to understand the problems of your country,

138
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:59,333
of the whole world.

139
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:05,542
And once you feel that you are the soldier to fight it out,

140
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:09,208
you have the responsibility to fight it out,

141
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:12,375
then things will work out.

142
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,333
We cannot leave everything to the divine Power.

143
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:25,583
You have to use the divine Power, and you have to work it out

144
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:30,041
because you are the soldiers of divine Power.

145
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:39,417
Of course, with that beautiful idea

146
00:13:40,542 --> 00:13:47,166
we start cleansing ourselves. You need not know everything

147
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:51,667
as to what things are happening and how they are happening,

148
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:55,667
how they are working out. That’s not your work.

149
00:13:56,709 --> 00:14:01,166
You are a soldier so you have to just fight,

150
00:14:01,709 --> 00:14:06,125
fight the ignorance – your own and of others.

151
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:12,125
Because mostly soldiers fail when they have their egos.

152
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:20,709
When they fail, they have other obstacles in their minds.

153
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:27,542
There should be no obstacle, but you should just  push forward

154
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:32,041
and know there’s no obstacle at all.

155
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:36,625
It’s just a myth that there are some obstacles

156
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:39,166
and that you cannot do it.

157
00:14:42,709 --> 00:14:47,333
It’s not easy to raise the awareness of people,

158
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:53,250
because looks there’s a very little distance

159
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:59,166
of crossing over, but it’s not so – it’s not.

160
00:14:59,417 --> 00:15:02,583
It is a very difficult task sometimes

161
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:11,208
for some people to get out of the bandhans of Agnya.

162
00:15:12,709 --> 00:15:16,667
At that point I find some of you fail.

163
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:22,208
And for that, best thing is to introspect.

164
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:27,083
When you think you are always correct and you are all right,

165
00:15:27,542 --> 00:15:31,333
it’s best is to introspect,

166
00:15:32,709 --> 00:15:35,709
“Am I doing everything right?

167
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:42,542
How am I working for my betterment?”

168
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:46,291
The illusion is such

169
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:49,250
that sometimes you think you are doing very well.

170
00:15:49,542 --> 00:15:53,375
Say, in our Sahaja Yoga some people are very forward type;

171
00:15:53,542 --> 00:15:56,125
they’ll come forward, they’ll do this, do that.

172
00:15:57,375 --> 00:16:03,125
But inside, what is the purpose?  The purpose is that

173
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:06,208
people should see that you are doing this work, that work.

174
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:10,500
The purpose should be

175
00:16:10,667 --> 00:16:13,417
that you should be able to see yourself within.

176
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:19,166
You must see what is the problem inside,

177
00:16:22,417 --> 00:16:25,709
and you can very well understand

178
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:33,000
that you have been of great help to yourself and to others.

179
00:16:34,709 --> 00:16:41,041
For example, there’s a very big building,

180
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:48,083
and all the buildings in the nearby area

181
00:16:48,417 --> 00:16:53,375
may fall down due to earthquake, but this one building

182
00:16:54,333 --> 00:17:00,333
which will be standing erect. The reason is that that building

183
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:04,667
is constructed on very solid grounds.

184
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,208
In the same way

185
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:10,583
if Sahaja Yoga is constructed on a very sound wall,

186
00:17:11,542 --> 00:17:16,458
nobody can destroy it, nobody can distort it;

187
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:20,417
and every person has to do that.

188
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:23,625
For example, some people told Me,

189
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,417
“Your Sahaja yogis, you know, are like this, and that

190
00:17:26,709 --> 00:17:29,166
they are big show-offs and that.”

191
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:34,458
I said, “Really? I can’t believe it

192
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:38,667
that they could be like that.

193
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:43,333
” I said, “I would like to meet them, whosoever they are.”

194
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:56,667
So they said, “No, You can find them out Yourself

195
00:17:57,333 --> 00:18:01,709
who are those people and why they behave like that.”

196
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:06,583
I said, “Myself I know everything,

197
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:11,166
but I want you to know everything.”

198
00:18:12,709 --> 00:18:17,709
Finding faults with others is a very nice thing, very easy also

199
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:21,417
– but find out faults within yourself.

200
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:26,083
What are these things that are strangling us?

201
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:36,709
This is the best way of improving your awareness.

202
00:18:37,709 --> 00:18:45,166
Like you are going in the car and you have to know the road,

203
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:50,125
you have to know how you are driving,

204
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:53,291
you have to see what are the problems.

205
00:18:54,417 --> 00:18:57,458
But instead of you think, oh, no end of yourself

206
00:18:58,542 --> 00:19:00,542
– it won’t work out.

207
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:07,375
Today is a day of very great happening, I should say.

208
00:19:07,709 --> 00:19:12,333
Celebrating the Diwali is a very, very

209
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,583
joyous thing.

210
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:26,166
But this joy is not for ourselves;

211
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:29,125
this joy is for the whole world.

212
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:32,709
We have to work for the whole world.

213
00:19:33,417 --> 00:19:38,667
We work for ourselves, for our jobs, for our money, whatever it is,

214
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:44,041
but what are you doing for others?

215
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:48,125
That you should see for yourself,

216
00:19:48,667 --> 00:19:55,458
that’s very important. Only such people are useful in Sahaja Yoga

217
00:19:57,208 --> 00:20:01,542
because they have concern, they have care,

218
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:04,500
and they are doing something for others.

219
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:11,000
It’s a great enjoyment with that, when the lights are burning,

220
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:17,375
it’s to give you happiness; they are burning their bodies

221
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:23,125
to give you happiness. They are the ones who should teach us

222
00:20:23,417 --> 00:20:26,333
that we have to do something ourselves

223
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:31,500
to enjoy our own higher awareness.

224
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:40,625
All this will work out, I am sure. I am also trying My best

225
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:48,417
to make this light unshaky

226
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:55,000
and full of enthusiasm.

227
00:20:56,458 --> 00:21:02,166
It’s there. It is you who are

228
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:07,583
anxious to fill your pitchers.

229
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:11,250
You can do it.

230
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:17,375
It’s not My anxiety that’s going to help you.

231
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:22,417
So you’ll start, and even if you want to have

232
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:28,166
complete picture about yourself,

233
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:36,041
you have to first give up identification with yourself;

234
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:41,709
otherwise you’ll never know what’s wrong with you.

235
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:46,500
If you are too much identified with you, you cannot come up.

236
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:52,667
Now as it is, what is the aim after all,

237
00:21:53,542 --> 00:21:56,667
what is the aim of our lives?

238
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:05,667
We have to change the whole world into a peaceful theme.

239
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:12,500
Changing yourself, of course, is great thing, no doubt;

240
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:19,625
but changing others also will stop all the problems of the world.

241
00:22:20,375 --> 00:22:24,417
If all the people of this world become good people, Sahaja yogis,

242
00:22:25,417 --> 00:22:28,000
then can you imagine what will happen?

243
00:22:28,417 --> 00:22:30,542
Think of that dream I have,

244
00:22:31,333 --> 00:22:38,166
that we have to change each and every person that we can change,

245
00:22:39,166 --> 00:22:43,208
and we have to transform them into good people.

246
00:22:44,625 --> 00:22:46,166
If they are not transformed

247
00:22:46,291 --> 00:22:48,709
they are like a candle without any flame in it.

248
00:22:49,458 --> 00:22:54,250
And if they are capable of getting transformed,

249
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:01,709
we should try all methods, all the tricks to do that.

250
00:23:03,417 --> 00:23:07,375
I’m sure very soon such a day will come when you will say,

251
00:23:08,166 --> 00:23:10,542
“Mother, now we are very safe.”

252
00:23:14,375 --> 00:23:18,000
Don’t think of the past and the problems of the past

253
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:21,000
– you have now overcome it.

254
00:23:21,542 --> 00:23:26,083
Just enjoy yourself and have faith in yourself,

255
00:23:26,375 --> 00:23:33,000
and work it out. I am sure very soon it will happen,

256
00:23:33,417 --> 00:23:40,000
very quickly it will happen. It is your desire, also

257
00:23:43,709 --> 00:23:46,166
your method of working it out,

258
00:23:46,542 --> 00:23:48,709
your anxiety to work it out.

259
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:53,417
Main anxiety should be, “How can I transform this person?”

260
00:23:56,667 --> 00:23:58,500
You can transform anyone.

261
00:23:59,542 --> 00:24:02,417
You know, you tell one person, another person follows it.

262
00:24:03,291 --> 00:24:05,375
Like when we came in the plane,

263
00:24:06,375 --> 00:24:09,250
I found at the airport so many people

264
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:12,083
had put up their hands towards Me like this.

265
00:24:12,417 --> 00:24:16,166
I said, “Who are these people?” They were not Sahaja yogis.

266
00:24:17,166 --> 00:24:22,041
They had seen somebody, or what had happened I couldn’t ask them,

267
00:24:23,041 --> 00:24:26,041
but all of them said, “We are feeling the cool breeze in the hand.

268
00:24:26,667 --> 00:24:28,583
” They didn’t know anything about it,

269
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,208
they didn’t know about kundalini, nothing.

270
00:24:31,375 --> 00:24:33,375
Then what is this cool coming?

271
00:24:34,333 --> 00:24:39,166
That basically they are there to get their realization,

272
00:24:40,125 --> 00:24:43,083
only we have to extend our ideals,

273
00:24:43,333 --> 00:24:46,583
we have to extend our love to them.

274
00:24:48,583 --> 00:24:51,583
Instead of getting annoyed with them,

275
00:24:52,417 --> 00:24:55,208
better is to give them a chance

276
00:24:56,291 --> 00:25:02,375
and you’ll be amazed that they are very anxious to get transformed.

277
00:25:03,166 --> 00:25:07,709
They’re all fed up with all the artificial things they’re having.

278
00:25:09,041 --> 00:25:12,458
It’s over now. You will be amazed

279
00:25:12,667 --> 00:25:17,458
how many are waiting there for you to give them Self-realization

280
00:25:18,125 --> 00:25:23,417
and let them celebrate their Diwali with you, enjoy the Diwali.

281
00:25:27,542 --> 00:25:31,041
Diwali you cannot celebrate with one candle.

282
00:25:32,417 --> 00:25:35,417
You have to have more and more of candles,

283
00:25:36,166 --> 00:25:38,291
and that’s what is your job.

284
00:25:39,041 --> 00:25:42,542
Only by your own candle you are going to do it; it’s your own,

285
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:49,542
and it can enlighten anyone. Then why not use it,

286
00:25:51,417 --> 00:25:53,625
at any cost, at any place?

287
00:25:56,667 --> 00:26:00,375
I have met some Sahaja yogis.

288
00:26:02,375 --> 00:26:06,041
I asked them, “What did you do?”

289
00:26:06,667 --> 00:26:08,375
They said, “No, nothing.”

290
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:11,041
“Nothing? You did nothing?”

291
00:26:12,125 --> 00:26:13,250
“No, nothing.”

292
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:17,709
Then what’s the use of getting realization?

293
00:26:19,041 --> 00:26:20,625
If you have done nothing,

294
00:26:21,458 --> 00:26:24,208
you don’t want to give realization to anyone,

295
00:26:24,542 --> 00:26:28,667
don’t want to talk to anyone, you feel so shy about it?

296
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:34,083
Then I met some who said, “Just now, Mother,

297
00:26:35,166 --> 00:26:39,375
we are coming from a program.”

298
00:26:41,083 --> 00:26:42,583
“How are you so late?”

299
00:26:43,667 --> 00:26:47,291
“Because they told us there’s a bomb scare.”

300
00:26:47,709 --> 00:26:50,125
“So you were waiting outside?”

301
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:51,458
“Yes.” “How many?”

302
00:26:51,625 --> 00:26:55,166
“All of us.  Thousands were waiting.

303
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:58,291
There was no bomb, they said there’s no bomb.

304
00:26:58,583 --> 00:27:01,250
So we went inside and we all got realization.”

305
00:27:01,625 --> 00:27:03,625
“But you were realized souls?”

306
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:06,417
“No, we had our realization,

307
00:27:06,709 --> 00:27:09,458
that sometimes we have to wait too.

308
00:27:10,709 --> 00:27:14,125
And now we are convinced that nobody can harm us,

309
00:27:14,667 --> 00:27:18,208
nobody can trouble us, overpower us.

310
00:27:18,417 --> 00:27:20,542
Only we do it to ourselves.”

311
00:27:21,166 --> 00:27:24,000
So again I will say introspection

312
00:27:24,417 --> 00:27:27,417
is very, very important in Sahaja Yoga.

313
00:27:28,125 --> 00:27:32,458
When the light inside is there, you have to look after it.

314
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:40,458
I was extremely happy to hear from many people

315
00:27:41,583 --> 00:27:47,375
that they felt the blessings of Diwali.

316
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:53,500
But you see, yesterday you had these showers

317
00:27:54,208 --> 00:27:58,000
– how timely they were! It never happened,

318
00:27:58,625 --> 00:28:02,291
in the history of this world it never happened;

319
00:28:02,458 --> 00:28:07,458
why yesterday these showers came in and tried to

320
00:28:08,417 --> 00:28:12,208
give a new experience of the showers?

321
00:28:13,208 --> 00:28:16,417
All this is a time, we should say,

322
00:28:17,166 --> 00:28:24,000
that even the nature knows and we should also know,

323
00:28:24,709 --> 00:28:28,458
that this is the time for a special thing.

324
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,500
Normally I get letters

325
00:28:33,375 --> 00:28:38,083
about people who are sick and their parents are sick or their ...

326
00:28:38,417 --> 00:28:40,375
this is sick, all kinds of things.

327
00:28:41,125 --> 00:28:43,458
Then somebody’s marriage is broken;

328
00:28:44,083 --> 00:28:47,500
then somebody has children, they are sick –

329
00:28:48,125 --> 00:28:52,542
??? all kinds of nonsensical problems, they do it.

330
00:28:54,375 --> 00:28:55,500
The reason is they

331
00:28:55,667 --> 00:28:58,125
themselves, those who write are not realized souls,

332
00:28:58,542 --> 00:29:01,375
or maybe they are halfway,

333
00:29:02,208 --> 00:29:04,166
because they could themself say

334
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:06,250
that “Why should we write to Mother?

335
00:29:07,083 --> 00:29:09,417
We can get it done ourselves.”

336
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:14,083
Instead of that, one has to write

337
00:29:14,583 --> 00:29:18,041
what they have achieved, how they have achieved very much,

338
00:29:18,375 --> 00:29:22,166
how they have got love from others,

339
00:29:23,083 --> 00:29:27,458
how they have worked out Sahaja Yoga in small villages.

340
00:29:28,458 --> 00:29:30,583
All this is much better to write,

341
00:29:31,166 --> 00:29:34,458
than to write, “My mother is sick, my father is sick.”

342
00:29:35,083 --> 00:29:40,375
All these relationships, they go on killing you.

343
00:29:41,417 --> 00:29:44,458
So no more is your brother, nobody is your sister;

344
00:29:46,166 --> 00:29:49,333
only Sahaja yogis are your brothers and sisters.

345
00:29:50,375 --> 00:29:54,166
Now you have some cousin and it’s cousin’s cousin and....

346
00:29:54,458 --> 00:29:58,458
So let it be. That’s not your job,

347
00:29:59,458 --> 00:30:01,458
you don’t have to work it out.

348
00:30:02,041 --> 00:30:05,458
Even before coming I got letters like that:

349
00:30:06,417 --> 00:30:09,291
somebody cousin’s cousin’s ... this thing.

350
00:30:10,125 --> 00:30:13,208
So I asked this lady, I said,

351
00:30:13,583 --> 00:30:16,291
“Why do you write all these things

352
00:30:16,709 --> 00:30:20,000
all the time about this cousin and that cousin?”

353
00:30:20,333 --> 00:30:23,083
She says, “Mother, I am trying to spread Sahaja Yoga.”

354
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:24,458
“How?”

355
00:30:24,667 --> 00:30:28,709
“Because if they’ll be cured, then they’ll come to Sahaja Yoga.”

356
00:30:29,542 --> 00:30:32,625
This is not the way we want to spread Sahaja Yoga.

357
00:30:33,542 --> 00:30:37,083
This looks like advertising or something,

358
00:30:37,333 --> 00:30:40,709
speciality that you should cure somebody,

359
00:30:41,166 --> 00:30:43,542
then some people will come to Sahaja Yoga.

360
00:30:44,208 --> 00:30:46,709
We just don’t want such people to come.

361
00:30:48,333 --> 00:30:52,500
I don’t want to hurt, but I want to give you courage

362
00:30:53,041 --> 00:30:56,166
and understanding, and the wisdom.

363
00:30:57,125 --> 00:30:59,417
What, why are we Sahaja yogis here

364
00:30:59,625 --> 00:31:03,583
– just to cure all the relations of ours?

365
00:31:05,041 --> 00:31:08,500
They may be sick because of some mistakes they have committed.

366
00:31:09,709 --> 00:31:13,083
Instead of paying attention to all these such people,

367
00:31:14,041 --> 00:31:19,583
you should pay attention to yourself and to your ascent.

368
00:31:20,166 --> 00:31:21,625
You have to respect yourself.

369
00:31:22,667 --> 00:31:26,041
If you are their relation, it’s none of your business.

370
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:31,291
Like understanding,

371
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:38,709
wisdom that we have come here for a

372
00:31:39,208 --> 00:31:43,709
very,  very special work of very high quality:

373
00:31:45,333 --> 00:31:50,250
that is not there. Then all such people write to Me.

374
00:31:51,166 --> 00:31:54,083
Now one lady got married in Sahaja Yoga

375
00:31:55,583 --> 00:31:59,458
and she wrote to Me that “I was divorced

376
00:32:00,583 --> 00:32:03,500
about eight months back or nine months back, whatever it is.

377
00:32:04,625 --> 00:32:07,375
And all my relations are now saying,

378
00:32:07,625 --> 00:32:10,458
‘Why did you marry in Sahaja Yoga?’

379
00:32:10,709 --> 00:32:14,250
And everybody is criticizing me and Sahaja Yoga.”

380
00:32:16,041 --> 00:32:20,458
I said, “Who asked her to marry?” I never asked her.

381
00:32:21,667 --> 00:32:25,000
So now the marriage has become the main point for her,

382
00:32:25,458 --> 00:32:28,375
that “all my family people are saying ...

383
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,667
” What did they do for Sahaja Yoga?

384
00:32:33,083 --> 00:32:35,333
If this marriage doesn’t become

385
00:32:35,625 --> 00:32:37,417
all right, then they will say there’s

386
00:32:37,583 --> 00:32:39,583
something wrong with Sahaja Yoga. Let them say.

387
00:32:42,625 --> 00:32:46,208
We have not committed that way.

388
00:32:48,667 --> 00:32:52,208
Every time I have told you that don’t write to Me for your mother,

389
00:32:52,375 --> 00:32:53,417
father, this, that.

390
00:32:55,208 --> 00:32:58,041
If you don’t know how to cure them, better give up Sahaja Yoga.

391
00:33:00,166 --> 00:33:02,458
You yourself can cure them

392
00:33:04,083 --> 00:33:06,333
you can work it out yourself.

393
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:11,333
But you should see it, so many letters every day for Me.

394
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:17,166
I ask them, “Is your father in Sahaja Yoga?”

395
00:33:17,375 --> 00:33:18,375
“Mother?" " No.”

396
00:33:18,667 --> 00:33:21,000
“Brother?” “No, nobody.”

397
00:33:21,709 --> 00:33:27,000
So why are you asking Me?

398
00:33:27,667 --> 00:33:30,166
What relationship I have with them?

399
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,458
They’re not Sahaja yogis. I am only responsible for Sahaja yogis.

400
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:39,417
They are not Sahaja yogis, so why do you want to trouble Me?

401
00:33:41,333 --> 00:33:44,041
It is impossible to understand.

402
00:33:45,709 --> 00:33:49,625
In Sahaja Yoga you are supposed to get Self-realization, all right.

403
00:33:50,709 --> 00:33:56,000
Then those who want to have Self-realization,

404
00:33:56,458 --> 00:34:00,125
you can give them and fix them properly.

405
00:34:00,667 --> 00:34:04,625
But instead of that somebody who is hanging in the air

406
00:34:05,291 --> 00:34:09,083
and who is falling from the airport to some other place,

407
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:10,625
all kinds of things

408
00:34:11,333 --> 00:34:16,208
– all this is really maddening, and is sickening.

409
00:34:17,208 --> 00:34:21,208
I’m not concerned; you should not be concerned also.

410
00:34:21,625 --> 00:34:24,083
What you should do is to see

411
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:28,583
that these people who're talking about it should come to Sahaja Yoga

412
00:34:30,375 --> 00:34:31,500
And you must tell them,

413
00:34:31,667 --> 00:34:35,083
“Because you are not doing Sahaja Yoga, that’s why it is like that”

414
00:34:37,041 --> 00:34:39,041
or “That person is not doing Sahaja Yoga,

415
00:34:39,166 --> 00:34:42,166
that’s why this is the problem is. We are all right, we are happy"

416
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:47,250
Because Sahaja Yoga is an open thing,

417
00:34:48,583 --> 00:34:50,709
so everybody comes there.

418
00:34:52,125 --> 00:34:54,542
I would request you on a Diwali day

419
00:34:55,041 --> 00:34:59,500
to promise to yourself, “I will not waste my energy

420
00:35:00,041 --> 00:35:02,291
on people who are not Sahaja yogis.

421
00:35:06,166 --> 00:35:07,667
” It’s very important,

422
00:35:08,625 --> 00:35:11,709
because all the time the attention is on wrong things

423
00:35:14,667 --> 00:35:16,542
and on wrong basis.

424
00:35:17,709 --> 00:35:20,083
If you have some intelligence

425
00:35:20,417 --> 00:35:23,500
you must know that now you belong

426
00:35:24,458 --> 00:35:31,375
to a very high-quality spiritual people,

427
00:35:33,166 --> 00:35:37,583
which are very few. In this world

428
00:35:39,125 --> 00:35:44,458
they are very few, and you must make a concentrated effort

429
00:35:45,667 --> 00:35:51,625
to see that this quality

430
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:55,709
must be in so many people,

431
00:35:56,291 --> 00:35:59,709
and there must be lots of aspiration about it.

432
00:36:00,375 --> 00:36:03,583
Find out such people, tell them

433
00:36:04,208 --> 00:36:06,542
you have found it – “you can also get it.”

434
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:11,583
But don’t worry about things

435
00:36:12,041 --> 00:36:14,667
which are of no value to us.

436
00:36:15,709 --> 00:36:18,083
You must know you are a special race.

437
00:36:19,333 --> 00:36:21,375
You are special soldiers

438
00:36:22,375 --> 00:36:27,458
who have been trained

439
00:36:29,166 --> 00:36:31,208
for doing Sahaj work only.

440
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:36,417
So wasting energy on your relations

441
00:36:36,542 --> 00:36:40,583
and brothers and sisters is no good for you.

442
00:36:44,291 --> 00:36:46,417
It is to be understood now

443
00:36:48,083 --> 00:36:52,625
that you have your own energy reserved

444
00:36:54,291 --> 00:36:58,333
– for what? For Sahaja yogis only.

445
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:06,041
You should help everyone

446
00:37:06,417 --> 00:37:09,208
who is a Sahaja yogi

447
00:37:09,375 --> 00:37:11,709
or who wants to become a Sahaja yogi.

448
00:37:13,542 --> 00:37:16,208
Who are established Sahaja yogis,

449
00:37:16,709 --> 00:37:20,667
you must help them; because we are one Personality

450
00:37:22,375 --> 00:37:25,375
and these are all the different hands

451
00:37:26,709 --> 00:37:30,166
of one Personality, one God.

452
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:36,250
So this oneness must be established

453
00:37:37,208 --> 00:37:43,625
within yourself, and also others should see that oneness in you.

454
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:49,166
There are some people who are very active.

455
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:55,125
There are some people who are very active in criticizing.

456
00:38:00,417 --> 00:38:03,083
All that will work out, I’m sure,

457
00:38:03,375 --> 00:38:09,291
because this is the year of great achievements and great success;

458
00:38:10,291 --> 00:38:14,417
but with that if you start doing something nonsensical,

459
00:38:15,208 --> 00:38:17,291
nothing will work out.

460
00:38:21,709 --> 00:38:25,375
Of course, I don’t say that we haven’t got such Sahaja yogis

461
00:38:25,542 --> 00:38:30,291
with us – we have. We have all the soldiers with us, no doubt.

462
00:38:31,041 --> 00:38:34,667
All the armament they have, everything they have;

463
00:38:35,417 --> 00:38:37,250
but we need more.

464
00:38:38,667 --> 00:38:42,667
And for that we have to work out collectively,

465
00:38:43,667 --> 00:38:46,333
must plan what should we do.

466
00:38:48,333 --> 00:38:51,500
Recently there has been a big

467
00:38:53,291 --> 00:38:57,291
argument about the Islamic behavior of people.

468
00:38:58,417 --> 00:39:02,125
We are neither Christians nor Islamic nor anything.

469
00:39:03,667 --> 00:39:11,166
We are not; because you cannot put yourself into a small

470
00:39:12,125 --> 00:39:15,709
arena, saying, “I am a Sahaja yogi, but I am a Christian.”

471
00:39:16,583 --> 00:39:20,667
You cannot.  You haveto give up that margin.

472
00:39:21,458 --> 00:39:24,125
You are a Sahaja yogi out and out,

473
00:39:24,667 --> 00:39:28,709
and all the other nonsensical things are not belonging to you.

474
00:39:31,375 --> 00:39:34,417
I have seen many Muslims also come to Sahaja Yoga,

475
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,250
but out of them very few are real Sahaja yogis.

476
00:39:40,375 --> 00:39:43,458
But they’ll come, listen to My lecture, this, that.

477
00:39:44,208 --> 00:39:50,542
But very few are really Sahaja yogis in the real sense of the word.

478
00:39:52,208 --> 00:39:56,625
Then you will start seeing the defects of your community

479
00:39:57,375 --> 00:40:02,625
of so-called religion you belong to, whatever it is you will see.

480
00:40:03,291 --> 00:40:08,625
And you will definitely try to correct it,

481
00:40:09,166 --> 00:40:10,667
if you love them

482
00:40:12,083 --> 00:40:14,250
– or you give up.

483
00:40:15,709 --> 00:40:19,667
These are special people, specially selected

484
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,500
for a very special cause,

485
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:27,125
and you cannot waste your energy on small, nonsensical things.

486
00:40:27,709 --> 00:40:30,291
That is one thing you should know.

487
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:33,542
On this Diwali day you have to know

488
00:40:34,291 --> 00:40:37,208
that you have to burn yourself

489
00:40:38,083 --> 00:40:44,542
for the light of the Divine to absolutely spread all over.

490
00:40:47,375 --> 00:40:49,667
But don’t do it too much.

491
00:40:50,125 --> 00:40:52,333
Like some people came and told Me,

492
00:40:52,667 --> 00:40:55,291
“Mother, we have given up our parents,

493
00:40:55,417 --> 00:40:57,625
we have given up this,  we have given up that.

494
00:40:58,291 --> 00:41:00,291
Still we are not good.”

495
00:41:00,709 --> 00:41:03,375
So I said, “Why should you give up?

496
00:41:04,166 --> 00:41:07,375
You are catching onto something, then you are giving up?

497
00:41:08,083 --> 00:41:11,041
Or automatically it’s just finished?”

498
00:41:11,458 --> 00:41:16,500
“Ah, we were, you see, very much attached to our family, parents,

499
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:22,375
country, this, that, and now we have given up some – but some.”

500
00:41:24,041 --> 00:41:27,000
Such half-baked people are no good,

501
00:41:28,375 --> 00:41:31,125
and don’t pay too much attention to them.

502
00:41:32,166 --> 00:41:34,375
They don’t deserve any attention.

503
00:41:35,709 --> 00:41:40,208
That is very much to be understood,

504
00:41:41,083 --> 00:41:43,208
that you should not be also like that,

505
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:46,417
nor you should have friends like that,.

506
00:41:46,583 --> 00:41:49,625
nor you should make them Sahaja yogis

507
00:41:50,458 --> 00:41:54,125
Sahaja yogi is a special character

508
00:41:54,333 --> 00:41:58,083
of a soldier who fights for the truth.

509
00:42:00,583 --> 00:42:06,583
That kind of a personality when you will have,

510
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:11,250
there will be lights all over.

511
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:19,250
This Diwali day I bless you all from My heart,

512
00:42:21,125 --> 00:42:24,125
and I want you to respect yourself

513
00:42:25,166 --> 00:42:29,125
and understand what is the position of

514
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:32,041
your being in this

515
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:40,542
organization,  we can call, or in this movement of Sahaja Yoga.

516
00:42:42,709 --> 00:42:45,458
And how are we working it out?

517
00:42:46,208 --> 00:42:48,250
The attention should move from

518
00:42:48,542 --> 00:42:52,458
all this nonsensical, mundane things to yourself.

519
00:42:54,250 --> 00:42:58,083
It should be a very dynamic force that should work out.

520
00:43:00,709 --> 00:43:04,208
And I’m sure next year it would be very different.

521
00:43:05,417 --> 00:43:11,250
We’ll have all the beautiful blessings of the Divine.

522
00:43:13,208 --> 00:43:16,166
We must do it collectively, understandingly.

523
00:43:16,709 --> 00:43:18,333
May God bless you.
