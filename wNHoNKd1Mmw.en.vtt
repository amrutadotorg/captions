00:00:01.501 --> 00:00:06.999
All this being said on My birthday,

00:00:08.792 --> 00:00:11.751
really embarrasses Me,

00:00:12.125 --> 00:00:16.709
because it's all being already

00:00:19.334 --> 00:00:22.459
scheduled, it was all timed out.

00:00:22.999 --> 00:00:25.417
It had to happen this way.

00:00:25.667 --> 00:00:29.626
And the time has come now that

00:00:32.083 --> 00:00:38.834
this whole world has to take to global understanding.

00:00:40.918 --> 00:00:43.959
Human beings, I was surprised,

00:00:44.459 --> 00:00:48.999
are how anxious in those difficult times

00:00:49.542 --> 00:00:53.375
to get to the truth; because very difficult

00:00:53.999 --> 00:00:58.334
to carry on with the truth, when there's untruth all along.

00:00:58.999 --> 00:01:02.999
And the way people get after you when you talk of truth,

00:01:03.375 --> 00:01:08.542
is also a very hazardous task to fight them

00:01:08.751 --> 00:01:12.292
those who are just always

00:01:13.709 --> 00:01:17.918
going to cruelties,

00:01:18.834 --> 00:01:21.999
to untruth, to aggressiveness.

00:01:23.083 --> 00:01:26.501
These are all self destructive elements.

00:01:27.334 --> 00:01:30.999
Also we have other self destructive elements within us,

00:01:31.709 --> 00:01:35.417
like drinking, smoking,

00:01:36.083 --> 00:01:41.876
we can say also other things, like drug taking. But people do it.

00:01:42.584 --> 00:01:44.918
Just they do it. Not that they don't know,

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.876
but they just do it because of the influence of the time.

00:01:51.626 --> 00:01:53.999
And that is what is the Kali Yuga,

00:01:54.542 --> 00:01:59.626
where we destroy ourselves and try to destroy others,

00:01:59.834 --> 00:02:05.083
and have a kind of a funny temptation for this

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:08.999
not only that, also we enjoy all these.

00:02:09.334 --> 00:02:15.167
All this cruelty, all this aggression we enjoy.

00:02:16.584 --> 00:02:20.209
Now when do we say that the Kali Yuga is over, we should know

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:23.542
something about Kali Yuga.

00:02:25.626 --> 00:02:28.959
Kali was one of the deities,

00:02:29.792 --> 00:02:34.083
who was supposed to bring in Kali Yuga,

00:02:34.334 --> 00:02:36.792
and all the problems of Kali Yuga.

00:02:37.042 --> 00:02:40.999
Firstly it creates illusions, "bhranti".

00:02:41.375 --> 00:02:45.709
It creates illusions. People will not understand

00:02:45.918 --> 00:02:48.999
who is a real person, who is an unreal person.

00:02:49.542 --> 00:02:52.999
So we have many false gurus as you know.

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.417
We have many false propagandists.

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:59.209
We have many people who talk big

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.709
but there's nothing in them.

00:03:02.334 --> 00:03:06.876
This is one type of a "bhranti" that Kali Yuga creates.

00:03:07.792 --> 00:03:11.999
Once it so happened, that Nala and Damayanti too

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.125
were in love with each other. They were husband and wife.

00:03:16.542 --> 00:03:20.375
And Damayanti was separated from Nala,

00:03:21.999 --> 00:03:25.792
by this horrible thing called Kali.

00:03:26.375 --> 00:03:32.000
This Kali fellow has being doing this kind of work,

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:35.167
used to create problems in the minds of people,

00:03:35.626 --> 00:03:39.459
disturbing families, disturbing nations, disturbing

00:03:39.876 --> 00:03:44.292
all the good wishes and the good feelings among human beings.

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:51.209
So once this gentleman, one we call Kali was caught up,

00:03:51.626 --> 00:03:56.459
by Nala, Nala, the one who hated him.

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.459
And Nala said that, "Why don't you allow me to kill you?

00:04:01.667 --> 00:04:05.584
You should be killed because you are such a horrible person,

00:04:05.792 --> 00:04:10.250
you create such bhranti, you create such problems for people.

00:04:10.876 --> 00:04:14.876
He said, "If you want to kill me, you can kill me

00:04:15.042 --> 00:04:18.584
but first listen to my importance, to my mahatmya.

00:04:18.834 --> 00:04:21.918
"What is your mahatmaya? What is your importance?"

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.125
He said, "My importance is, that when I'll come on this earth,

00:04:26.709 --> 00:04:30.250
when I'll rule on this earth, I know there will be bhranti,

00:04:30.459 --> 00:04:33.459
there will be chaos, there will be problems,

00:04:33.667 --> 00:04:37.292
but people will be so much fed up with that,

00:04:37.667 --> 00:04:40.417
that they will seek the truth.

00:04:40.792 --> 00:04:45.083
And those people today who are going to the hills and dales

00:04:45.292 --> 00:04:48.751
to find out the truth, will be there

00:04:49.834 --> 00:04:53.792
as ordinary human beings, as householders.

00:04:53.999 --> 00:04:56.999
And they will find the truth,

00:04:58.125 --> 00:05:00.042
definitely they'll find the truth.

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.876
It has been already predicted by Kali himself.

00:05:04.501 --> 00:05:09.375
So as you see lots of chaos is there, lots of problems are there,

00:05:09.584 --> 00:05:12.584
and when you see people you can't understand,

00:05:12.792 --> 00:05:16.918
how such people who are educated, intelligent,

00:05:17.083 --> 00:05:19.584
supposed to be at the helm of affairs,

00:05:19.792 --> 00:05:23.250
can go about with wrong ideas, with wrong things.

00:05:23.999 --> 00:05:26.501
The problem is this Kali Yuga.

00:05:26.709 --> 00:05:32.042
This creates this funny situation, in our lives.

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:37.751
Firstly it creates a situation where a person starts thinking,

00:05:37.999 --> 00:05:41.876
he's very insecure and he must take to some way,

00:05:42.042 --> 00:05:44.626
of protecting himself.

00:05:45.751 --> 00:05:50.209
And then where he goes to, is the place where he will be destroyed,

00:05:51.584 --> 00:05:54.709
before he knows even that he'll be destroyed.

00:05:55.792 --> 00:05:58.918
The second point is that we have

00:05:59.292 --> 00:06:03.167
a great sense of jealousy.

00:06:04.167 --> 00:06:09.999
That sense of jealousy is even more heighten by this Kali Yuga.

00:06:11.334 --> 00:06:13.792
We feel jealous for everything,

00:06:14.125 --> 00:06:18.209
which it shows our inferiority complex, or I don't know what it is?

00:06:18.751 --> 00:06:22.375
But we start feeling jealous and out of jealousy we start

00:06:22.584 --> 00:06:25.167
hating people without any rhyme and reason.

00:06:25.584 --> 00:06:27.792
So many countries have this problem.

00:06:28.125 --> 00:06:33.000
It's at the top, politicians,

00:06:33.292 --> 00:06:37.209
they indulge into this kind of a hatred for other people,

00:06:37.584 --> 00:06:41.584
without understanding what is the

00:06:42.375 --> 00:06:45.626
achievement of the other person is, how he has achieved,

00:06:45.834 --> 00:06:48.459
and "Why should I be jealous?"

00:06:50.626 --> 00:06:54.542
Then we have, another thing is apart from that is,

00:06:54.751 --> 00:06:58.709
which is the worst thing as Krishna has said, is the temper.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.209
Hot tempered people, you see, cannot see the truth,

00:07:04.959 --> 00:07:08.417
because at the slightest provocation

00:07:08.709 --> 00:07:12.792
they become hot-tempered and start hitting others

00:07:12.959 --> 00:07:16.334
and beating others or saying horrible things

00:07:16.584 --> 00:07:20.959
which should not be said. Now, this is another

00:07:21.375 --> 00:07:25.709
criteria for every Sahaja Yogi to know,

00:07:25.999 --> 00:07:33.417
how far he is out of this sense of "krodha", is the anger.

00:07:35.918 --> 00:07:39.751
To be angry it shows that you have

00:07:40.626 --> 00:07:46.167
no peace within and that you get angry for

00:07:46.834 --> 00:07:50.792
just to attack another person, which is not necessary.

00:07:51.167 --> 00:07:56.083
Even keeping quiet you can be very much effective.

00:07:57.709 --> 00:08:01.042
There's a story about Chinese people that

00:08:01.751 --> 00:08:04.751
in China there was a fight going on between

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:11.083
some people, and they said, "Let's have the cocks fight for us".

00:08:11.501 --> 00:08:13.834
So they had a cock fight.

00:08:13.999 --> 00:08:18.709
So one fellow took a cock to a Zen fellow and he said that

00:08:18.999 --> 00:08:22.959
"What, what should I do, if this cock has to fight?"

00:08:24.751 --> 00:08:27.709
And he said that, "Very simple,

00:08:27.999 --> 00:08:30.709
you teach the cock to be absolutely quiet."

00:08:30.876 --> 00:08:33.834
He said, "I can't do that." He said, "All right, give me the cock."

00:08:33.999 --> 00:08:37.626
And he taught the cock how to be quiet,

00:08:37.999 --> 00:08:40.918
whatever is happening, whosoever is attacking him.

00:08:41.709 --> 00:08:46.334
When he went into the arena, many cocks started attacking him,

00:08:46.501 --> 00:08:49.959
and he was just standing quietly, watching at everyone.

00:08:50.792 --> 00:08:54.542
This settled the thing because everybody ran away and they thought

00:08:54.709 --> 00:08:57.292
he is such a powerful thing, he's not saying anything. So not

00:09:01.083 --> 00:09:05.083
attacking not reacting that we achieve anything.

00:09:05.876 --> 00:09:10.125
Actually reaction is a very great enemy of human beings,

00:09:10.417 --> 00:09:12.459
that we react to everything.

00:09:12.667 --> 00:09:16.167
We should not react, we should just become silent.

00:09:16.459 --> 00:09:19.792
And then this power, which I tell you about,

00:09:19.999 --> 00:09:24.042
is the power of Paramchaitanya, acts.

00:09:24.334 --> 00:09:27.542
If you want to react, all right. It says, "Go ahead".

00:09:27.876 --> 00:09:32.542
But if you leave it and you just become quiet,

00:09:32.918 --> 00:09:37.375
silent, it acts. It acts so well.

00:09:37.751 --> 00:09:42.292
It can act sitting down here, it can act somewhere else.

00:09:42.417 --> 00:09:47.792
It is such a tremendous power. It is such an effective power.

00:09:47.999 --> 00:09:51.709
It is such an understanding, knowledgeable power,

00:09:51.918 --> 00:09:55.792
and above all it loves, it loves you.

00:09:56.375 --> 00:10:00.792
So when this power comes into existence in a way,

00:10:00.999 --> 00:10:03.250
I would say it has been always existing,

00:10:03.417 --> 00:10:07.334
but when effective, in the Krita Yuga it is effective,

00:10:08.125 --> 00:10:12.167
by that you'll be amazed how things happen.

00:10:12.334 --> 00:10:15.501
Everybody tells Me, "Mother this miracle has taken place,

00:10:15.667 --> 00:10:17.834
that miracle has taken place. "

00:10:17.999 --> 00:10:21.042
So, I know it's not miracle. It is Paramchaitanya,

00:10:21.250 --> 00:10:24.626
which is doing all the work, all the beautiful things,

00:10:24.834 --> 00:10:28.792
which is trying to help you and trying to suggest its love.

00:10:29.292 --> 00:10:33.792
You see, it is something we can't see

00:10:34.751 --> 00:10:37.667
something we cannot conceive with this mind.

00:10:38.083 --> 00:10:41.751
But it is beyond the mind that it works.

00:10:41.999 --> 00:10:46.334
I was surprised in Russia specially, I had to face the scientists.

00:10:46.999 --> 00:10:51.918
Then the scientists were so, so much equipped, so much deep and

00:10:52.167 --> 00:10:55.999
they understood so well, even in a place,

00:11:00.417 --> 00:11:03.834
you can call it a place of great learning,

00:11:04.125 --> 00:11:07.792
one of the oldest universities, St. Petersburg University.

00:11:08.542 --> 00:11:12.584
There also I don't know, what made they gave Me

00:11:12.751 --> 00:11:17.709
the highest reward. For what? I didn't know.

00:11:17.999 --> 00:11:21.250
But they said, "You are even higher than science."

00:11:21.626 --> 00:11:24.209
So this they called as cognitive science.

00:11:24.542 --> 00:11:26.751
They gave a name as cognitive science.

00:11:26.999 --> 00:11:30.292
"So Mother Your whole knowledge is of cognitive science."

00:11:30.792 --> 00:11:35.375
Only thing is, if I tell you something then you can verify it.

00:11:35.834 --> 00:11:38.417
The scientists can verify it.

00:11:38.584 --> 00:11:42.375
Everybody can find it out if it so or not.

00:11:42.792 --> 00:11:46.584
But if you put this test to all these false gurus,

00:11:46.792 --> 00:11:50.876
you will see that they, they don't have any scientific basis.

00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:56.125
They have no way of giving you any explanation,

00:11:56.334 --> 00:11:59.792
as to why this is happening and what is happening?

00:12:00.501 --> 00:12:03.792
I had to face all of them all over the world.

00:12:03.999 --> 00:12:06.667
And I was surprised they recognized Me.

00:12:06.999 --> 00:12:11.334
And they said, "Mother this is cognitive science" and like that,

00:12:11.584 --> 00:12:15.042
they gave Me, everywhere they gave Me awards and things like that.

00:12:15.584 --> 00:12:18.334
I never knew what is cognitive science is.

00:12:18.501 --> 00:12:22.417
But this is the knowledge that you get beyond your mind.

00:12:22.999 --> 00:12:25.334
With your mind you get is your

00:12:25.667 --> 00:12:30.209
biased, maybe full of jealousy, maybe full of anger.

00:12:30.501 --> 00:12:34.999
But beyond the mind even you get this knowledge that is absolute.

00:12:35.876 --> 00:12:38.792
Nobody can challenge it, absolute knowledge.

00:12:39.334 --> 00:12:44.125
For example, I'll tell you one thing and if you see this model

00:12:45.083 --> 00:12:47.292
from the right side to the left side,

00:12:47.417 --> 00:12:49.709
there it will look like a swastika.

00:12:50.125 --> 00:12:52.751
I made a model for them, to show them.

00:12:53.209 --> 00:12:56.334
And if you see it from the left side on the right side

00:12:56.542 --> 00:12:58.709
it will be "aum" written down.

00:12:58.918 --> 00:13:01.584
And if you see from down upward,

00:13:01.999 --> 00:13:06.292
it is a cross, that means,

00:13:07.209 --> 00:13:12.501
Shri Ganesha, who is on Mooladhara, incarnates as Christ.

00:13:13.876 --> 00:13:16.292
So they made a picture, they made a model,

00:13:16.999 --> 00:13:19.459
the scientists, and they found out

00:13:20.042 --> 00:13:23.417
that what I said is true and this model

00:13:23.626 --> 00:13:27.626
really can be shown. I mean one of them is like this,

00:13:27.834 --> 00:13:31.334
that whatever you know, whatever you say,

00:13:31.626 --> 00:13:35.459
should be verified by even scientists.

00:13:36.292 --> 00:13:38.417
I do not discard science.

00:13:38.792 --> 00:13:41.667
Science is amoral, whatever you may say.

00:13:41.959 --> 00:13:45.250
But once they come to Sahaja Yoga, these scientists,

00:13:45.459 --> 00:13:47.542
they just get transformed.

00:13:47.834 --> 00:13:51.459
But scientists, in other countries, I don't know about our country,

00:13:51.751 --> 00:13:56.250
in other countries have reached such a state, such a state,

00:13:56.626 --> 00:14:00.417
that they want to know what is beyond.

00:14:00.667 --> 00:14:03.999
All of them come to India, why? Why don't they go to Japan?

00:14:04.167 --> 00:14:08.459
Why don't they go to China, why don't they go to America?

00:14:08.626 --> 00:14:11.417
To find the truth they come to India.

00:14:11.751 --> 00:14:16.250
So in India this cognitive science existed long time back,

00:14:16.459 --> 00:14:19.334
of which we are not aware.

00:14:20.042 --> 00:14:23.999
Like I must say, Indians suddenly became very westernized,

00:14:24.209 --> 00:14:28.375
after independence somehow, all Gandhiji's ideas,

00:14:28.584 --> 00:14:31.375
and everything was put on the shelves.

00:14:31.584 --> 00:14:35.125
So, we, we didn't know what was so great in our country.

00:14:35.459 --> 00:14:40.501
Such a great "sampada", such a great power

00:14:40.667 --> 00:14:45.501
existed in this country and they knew so many things,

00:14:45.999 --> 00:14:51.375
so many things about, some things that science do not know.

00:14:52.083 --> 00:14:54.959
Now it is for science to find out,

00:14:55.083 --> 00:14:57.626
whatever they have said it's true or not.

00:14:57.751 --> 00:15:00.334
I have seen this, it's very simple,

00:15:00.751 --> 00:15:04.375
if you really know the truth and you tell a scientist

00:15:04.584 --> 00:15:06.876
he'll get after it and he'll work it out.

00:15:07.626 --> 00:15:11.042
It's not one example, there can be hundreds I can give you,

00:15:11.209 --> 00:15:13.501
where I've told them something. They said, " All right."

00:15:13.626 --> 00:15:16.999
"You verify, you find out, by your scientific methods."

00:15:18.083 --> 00:15:22.459
And they found it, they found it. There's so many ways

00:15:22.792 --> 00:15:26.209
of finding it out, you have in science.

00:15:26.501 --> 00:15:28.834
But they don't know what to find.

00:15:29.083 --> 00:15:31.751
They are just going on in this one, that one.

00:15:31.918 --> 00:15:34.417
They are going to the moon, they are going to this thing.

00:15:34.584 --> 00:15:38.501
That's not the way. First you find out what you have to find

00:15:38.999 --> 00:15:41.792
and then see if it is there or not.

00:15:42.292 --> 00:15:45.292
I was surprised in the West, though we call them

00:15:45.459 --> 00:15:48.792
very much sort of advanced and all these things,

00:15:48.999 --> 00:15:52.667
but as far as spirituality is concerned they are nowhere.

00:15:53.626 --> 00:15:58.042
Their cognitive science faculty is very poor compared to us.

00:15:58.584 --> 00:16:03.667
But our also is zero because we have all become westernised now.

00:16:04.209 --> 00:16:06.667
All our ideas are westernised

00:16:06.792 --> 00:16:09.250
and we take all the knowledge from outside.

00:16:09.751 --> 00:16:12.375
And even those who want to do something

00:16:12.999 --> 00:16:17.667
about Indian culture and all that, they are so small,

00:16:17.999 --> 00:16:22.334
they are so incapable of

00:16:22.999 --> 00:16:26.417
telling them what it is. It has nothing to do

00:16:26.584 --> 00:16:30.083
with a fundamentalist idea, nothing of the kind.

00:16:30.334 --> 00:16:34.459
But it is a fact, it's the truth. it's the reality,

00:16:34.751 --> 00:16:37.918
which they don't know themselves. They just want to proclaim,

00:16:38.125 --> 00:16:42.292
the Bhartiya Sanskriti, Indian culture,

00:16:42.459 --> 00:16:44.334
but there is nothing like that.

00:16:44.542 --> 00:16:47.834
Because unless and until you are a realized soul

00:16:48.501 --> 00:16:51.209
and you have reached that state,

00:16:51.792 --> 00:16:54.999
till then you do not know anything

00:16:55.125 --> 00:16:57.792
about the mysteries of Paramchaitanya.

00:16:58.459 --> 00:17:03.083
So for every Indian it is very important to take to Sahaja Yoga.

00:17:04.417 --> 00:17:07.459
Also for all the people all over the world.

00:17:07.626 --> 00:17:11.000
Everywhere as she told you about Russia, the condition is very bad,

00:17:11.459 --> 00:17:16.792
but still I must say the Sahaja Yogis are very much happy there.

00:17:17.542 --> 00:17:21.375
The way, when I was there once there was this coup was on,

00:17:21.999 --> 00:17:24.167
and everybody was worried and we saw lots of

00:17:24.584 --> 00:17:26.167
tankers passing, this thing and all.

00:17:26.584 --> 00:17:29.792
So I asked these Russian Sahaja Yogis,

00:17:29.999 --> 00:17:34.083
they are more than I think one lakh,

00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:36.751
much more than one lakh, I don't know how many they are.

00:17:36.918 --> 00:17:39.292
So I asked them, "Aren't you worried,

00:17:39.584 --> 00:17:41.459
what is happening in your country?"

00:17:41.584 --> 00:17:43.792
He said, "Mother we are not". I said, "Why?"

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.250
"Because we are in the kingdom of God,

00:17:46.417 --> 00:17:48.751
why should we worry about Russia?"

00:17:50.125 --> 00:17:53.417
You see, this also is a temperament that changes.

00:17:53.584 --> 00:17:55.584
and a person doesn't tell lies,

00:17:55.751 --> 00:17:58.667
but he really feels that way and that's how

00:17:58.876 --> 00:18:02.501
he gets rid of all these nonsensical ideas

00:18:02.751 --> 00:18:07.417
of religion, cast, nation, this, that.

00:18:08.417 --> 00:18:11.334
It separates human beings from human beings.

00:18:12.292 --> 00:18:15.334
But artificially you cannot join them.

00:18:15.709 --> 00:18:18.792
Many people start talking, "No, no, we should not have

00:18:18.999 --> 00:18:21.792
all these different things, we should have one."

00:18:22.209 --> 00:18:24.209
You can't, you can't have.

00:18:25.459 --> 00:18:29.167
Because temperamentally human beings are not made like that,

00:18:30.584 --> 00:18:34.292
You see, we had a little discussion there in Italy,

00:18:34.751 --> 00:18:36.792
with other religious groups,

00:18:36.999 --> 00:18:40.667
and they said, "We, we don't want one religion,

00:18:40.959 --> 00:18:42.999
one global religion, we don't want."

00:18:43.209 --> 00:18:46.250
I said, "Why? Because you want to fight, that's why?

00:18:46.459 --> 00:18:48.918
Why you don't want one religion?

00:18:49.083 --> 00:18:52.042
One religion is that you are a human being,

00:18:52.292 --> 00:18:55.167
and you are a wonderful human being,

00:18:55.459 --> 00:18:58.125
and that you can be one with the Divine.

00:18:58.334 --> 00:19:03.834
This is your religion which is promised and has to work out.

00:19:04.250 --> 00:19:07.792
And, but they wouldn't accept. But the people are changing.

00:19:08.626 --> 00:19:11.667
They are transforming themselves so fast

00:19:11.999 --> 00:19:14.250
that I am surprised in a country like Turkey,

00:19:14.417 --> 00:19:16.918
we have two thousands Sahaja Yogis.

00:19:18.626 --> 00:19:22.792
And they are converting so many. So all these funny ideas that,

00:19:22.999 --> 00:19:26.125
all these priests, mulaahs and all those have created,

00:19:26.999 --> 00:19:31.751
are going down. And what is coming up?  Even we have lots of these

00:19:32.459 --> 00:19:36.542
people in India, panditas, and shastras and this and that,

00:19:36.999 --> 00:19:40.334
they don't know anything I would say, because unless and until

00:19:40.834 --> 00:19:45.459
they feel the Paramchaitanya, their all talking is baseless.

00:19:47.083 --> 00:19:51.459
So all these problems which are created by fighting,

00:19:51.751 --> 00:19:56.334
by aggressiveness, showing off or whatever you may call,

00:19:56.751 --> 00:19:58.834
can be corrected with Sahaja Yoga

00:19:58.999 --> 00:20:01.334
because your attention goes beyond the mind.

00:20:02.959 --> 00:20:04.834
You go beyond the mind.

00:20:04.999 --> 00:20:08.375
This Agnya chakra opens and you go beyond the mind

00:20:08.542 --> 00:20:10.834
and then you are one with this divine power.

00:20:11.292 --> 00:20:13.459
Once you are one with the divine power,

00:20:13.667 --> 00:20:18.167
how it works for you in small, small ways.

00:20:18.584 --> 00:20:20.167
I mean you all have experience,

00:20:20.375 --> 00:20:22.417
you are all Sahaja Yogis so I need not tell you,

00:20:22.751 --> 00:20:27.709
but everyone can tell so many examples, by which

00:20:28.167 --> 00:20:31.667
he knows that it's the Paramchaitanya which has worked it.

00:20:32.459 --> 00:20:37.042
So first and foremost thing of every seeker of truth

00:20:37.292 --> 00:20:41.375
who is a real person, is to first get Self-Realization.

00:20:41.876 --> 00:20:45.626
That is the essence of spirituality, all over the world,

00:20:45.876 --> 00:20:48.417
even if you read Bible, if you read Koran.

00:20:48.584 --> 00:20:51.709
Nobody has read them that's the best part of it.

00:20:51.918 --> 00:20:55.709
And they are trying to say things which are very shameful.

00:20:56.417 --> 00:20:59.667
which are not there and they are fighting for that.

00:21:00.083 --> 00:21:03.792
With all these things they have helped us very much to show,

00:21:03.999 --> 00:21:09.209
that the essence of all these religions is one and out of that will

00:21:09.959 --> 00:21:14.584
one day people will take to Self Realization.

00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:20.125
Once they take to Self Realization, then they have to grow.

00:21:20.292 --> 00:21:23.042
Once they have grown into it, they can see.

00:21:23.209 --> 00:21:26.167
All of you know, you are all Sahaja Yogis sitting here,

00:21:26.375 --> 00:21:29.999
you know how much you have gained and how much you have achieved.

00:21:30.292 --> 00:21:33.501
So to give Me the credit, I don't know,

00:21:36.501 --> 00:21:40.459
it's not really true, because,

00:21:41.417 --> 00:21:43.792
we had great saints in some countries,

00:21:44.375 --> 00:21:47.083
great saints in this country, in every country,

00:21:47.417 --> 00:21:50.250
you know we had sufis in so many countries.

00:21:50.417 --> 00:21:54.792
They all have tried to say, that take your Self Realization.

00:21:55.250 --> 00:21:57.334
"Know thy Self."

00:21:57.667 --> 00:22:00.751
They all have said the same thing, "Know thy Self".

00:22:00.999 --> 00:22:03.999
But nobody is doing that, that's a different point.

00:22:04.250 --> 00:22:08.167
But actually all those who were Realized souls, whether they were

00:22:08.417 --> 00:22:12.292
from a Muslim religion or a Hindu religion or a Christian religion,

00:22:12.584 --> 00:22:17.083
any religion in any country if they were Realized souls,

00:22:17.501 --> 00:22:20.876
they said the same. Because truth is the same.

00:22:21.584 --> 00:22:25.334
They said the same thing, "First know thy Self"

00:22:25.999 --> 00:22:28.250
and then you will know the truth.

00:22:28.542 --> 00:22:32.584
So this is the essence of our life

00:22:32.792 --> 00:22:35.626
that we have to know ourselves.

00:22:35.751 --> 00:22:40.626
Once we know ourselves, you are beyond everything, because

00:22:40.876 --> 00:22:47.542
what happens that you become like an ocean becomes in this,

00:22:49.042 --> 00:22:51.584
like a drop becomes in the ocean.

00:22:51.792 --> 00:22:55.709
How it disappears... In the same thing it will happen.

00:22:56.042 --> 00:22:59.292
And once it happens, you'll be surprised,

00:22:59.501 --> 00:23:04.417
that you are really one with everyone. Who is the other?

00:23:05.959 --> 00:23:09.584
You are one with everyone, that's how we find in Sahaja Yoga.

00:23:09.792 --> 00:23:13.459
It's a, many people say, it's a big charisma

00:23:13.584 --> 00:23:16.125
it's big this thing. Nothing of the kind.

00:23:16.292 --> 00:23:19.083
You have your own Kundalini,

00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:23.459
you have own possibility, of becoming Self Realizing.

00:23:23.584 --> 00:23:27.417
Now, that is the blessing of Kali Yuga.

00:23:27.876 --> 00:23:29.999
In the Kali Yuga, this was going to happen

00:23:30.042 --> 00:23:31.709
and that's what it is happening.

00:23:31.876 --> 00:23:34.584
That's why thousands of you are getting Realization.

00:23:34.834 --> 00:23:37.292
Before, only one would get from one person,

00:23:37.459 --> 00:23:40.125
and those gurus were also very strict, you know, they

00:23:40.292 --> 00:23:42.999
would not give it to some ordinary person.

00:23:43.125 --> 00:23:47.959
They used to take them to task and judge them first.

00:23:48.083 --> 00:23:49.709
And then they would give Realization.

00:23:49.876 --> 00:23:52.459
But in Sahaja Yoga we don't do anything.

00:23:52.834 --> 00:23:55.834
You just have to get into Sahaja Yoga, that's all.

00:23:56.209 --> 00:23:59.125
Now, as it is, I'm surprised that

00:23:59.334 --> 00:24:03.250
how intellectuals and this and that try to find faults,

00:24:03.501 --> 00:24:06.542
without knowing that they don't know anything.

00:24:07.459 --> 00:24:10.334
They have to become Self-Realized people.

00:24:10.709 --> 00:24:14.459
Then, whatever they will do, that will be,

00:24:14.626 --> 00:24:17.999
definitely very constructive, very helpful,

00:24:18.459 --> 00:24:21.417
and peace giving, and harmony giving to the whole society.

00:24:22.334 --> 00:24:24.792
But first of all it has to be within you.

00:24:24.999 --> 00:24:27.999
If it is not within you, how can you give it to others.

00:24:28.626 --> 00:24:32.792
I've been watching how Sahaja Yoga has grown from one person

00:24:32.999 --> 00:24:34.667
to all these, so many of them.

00:24:34.834 --> 00:24:37.709
And we have so many others, in other countries also.

00:24:38.250 --> 00:24:42.667
This all has shown that the time has come

00:24:42.876 --> 00:24:45.250
for the whole world to change.

00:24:45.459 --> 00:24:50.459
And this transformation is the most important thing,

00:24:51.250 --> 00:24:53.042
what we should aim at.

00:24:53.209 --> 00:24:56.125
Forget about everything. Forget about politics, economics,

00:24:56.334 --> 00:24:59.709
this, that, but get transformation.

00:24:59.999 --> 00:25:04.125
Once you are transformed, you know how to do the right thing,

00:25:05.834 --> 00:25:07.999
how to do the things

00:25:08.125 --> 00:25:10.792
that will help you and the society.

00:25:11.584 --> 00:25:14.626
All these you already have seen in your life,

00:25:14.999 --> 00:25:19.709
and whatever is happened, is none of My only effort

00:25:19.918 --> 00:25:22.792
but there have been so many who have been doing this.

00:25:22.999 --> 00:25:27.042
Only if you can say anything is Me, is that I found out

00:25:27.250 --> 00:25:30.751
a way by which en masse Realization can be given.

00:25:31.542 --> 00:25:34.334
Many people can get it. Because any discovery,

00:25:34.501 --> 00:25:37.751
supposing there's electricity and if it cannot be used

00:25:37.999 --> 00:25:39.959
en masse, it is useless.

00:25:40.042 --> 00:25:44.292
So that's the only thing I've been able to achieve in My life,

00:25:44.459 --> 00:25:47.667
that en masse Realization can be given.

00:25:47.999 --> 00:25:52.042
And that has happen, as you know very well. It's very simple.

00:25:52.209 --> 00:25:55.459
And once one person gets Realization,

00:25:55.584 --> 00:25:57.709
he can go and give Realization to others.

00:25:57.876 --> 00:25:59.375
Now first, they were telling Me,

00:25:59.542 --> 00:26:02.334
"Mother, we are in seventy countries working".

00:26:02.584 --> 00:26:05.792
Now they are telling Me, "We are in eighty countries". How?

00:26:06.250 --> 00:26:08.542
Somebody went there and he did in that country,

00:26:08.709 --> 00:26:10.876
he went there, he did in other country.

00:26:10.999 --> 00:26:14.584
So, just imagine how simple it has become.

00:26:14.999 --> 00:26:18.459
How simple it is for Me. At this age I can't go

00:26:18.709 --> 00:26:20.792
to seventy, eighty countries,

00:26:20.999 --> 00:26:23.542
but it has passed there, it has gone there.

00:26:23.751 --> 00:26:27.834
It has given the blessings of the Divine.

00:26:28.083 --> 00:26:30.375
So, while you are here,

00:26:30.584 --> 00:26:34.083
you should know here only we had Nizzamuddin Aulia.

00:26:34.209 --> 00:26:37.792
Now Nizzamuddin was here and here we had Damdam Sahib.

00:26:37.999 --> 00:26:40.584
All these were great saints.

00:26:41.584 --> 00:26:44.792
And they talked of love, they talked of understanding,

00:26:44.999 --> 00:26:48.334
but talk becomes talk for them because the others who are listening,

00:26:48.709 --> 00:26:51.042
have no understanding about.

00:26:52.167 --> 00:26:57.167
So we are recipients of their blessings, their beauties

00:26:57.334 --> 00:27:01.751
and their greatness, is only when we are Sahaja Yogis,

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.459
or we are Realized souls.

00:27:04.751 --> 00:27:08.000
So I bless you all with whole My heart and with whole My soul

00:27:08.584 --> 00:27:14.792
and I have been trying to work out in a way,

00:27:14.999 --> 00:27:18.417
that I was surprised, in America, it is spreading so fast,

00:27:18.751 --> 00:27:21.792
otherwise all the false gurus have been to America.

00:27:22.292 --> 00:27:26.751
But now it is something great that is happening, suddenly,

00:27:26.999 --> 00:27:29.792
so, I told them I'll come and stay in America,

00:27:29.999 --> 00:27:35.334
for about two two months at least, for their satisfaction.

00:27:35.667 --> 00:27:38.375
Now, staying anywhere is not so important.

00:27:38.709 --> 00:27:44.417
What is important is that people should understand,

00:27:45.959 --> 00:27:48.167
they should humble down

00:27:48.375 --> 00:27:51.209
and they should know, "No, we still we have to know the truth".

00:27:51.918 --> 00:27:55.375
If once this humility comes in, it will work out.

00:27:55.876 --> 00:27:58.459
It will work out in any person,

00:27:58.999 --> 00:28:02.792
anyone, whatever may be the cast, religion,

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.375
race, makes no difference.

00:28:06.501 --> 00:28:10.834
So may God bless you again and again, and I bless you from My heart.

00:28:10.999 --> 00:28:14.417
Thank you very much for this felicitation. Thank you.
