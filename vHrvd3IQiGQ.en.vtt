00:00:00.701 --> 00:00:03.020
I raise my Kundalini

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:09.220
I keep my left hand open on my leg,
right hand towards my spine

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.487
and slowly I will raise like this

00:00:12.567 --> 00:00:16.154
with my fingers my attention goes with them

00:00:16.234 --> 00:00:21.154
so my attention is here and reach one by one

00:00:21.234 --> 00:00:27.467
and I bring it my hand up to here

00:00:30.434 --> 00:00:47.601
That will be the one, two, three

00:00:52.033 --> 00:01:00.801
four, five

00:01:04.234 --> 00:01:11.067
six, seven

00:01:12.167 --> 00:01:16.287
Then I'll take from left to right seven times

00:01:16.367 --> 00:01:21.367
one, two

00:01:22.934 --> 00:01:30.767
three, four, five

00:01:31.734 --> 00:01:35.987
six, seven

00:01:36.067 --> 00:01:40.320
then again I will read from the center

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.320
one

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.501
two, three

00:01:50.767 --> 00:01:56.067
four, five

00:01:57.234 --> 00:02:01.467
six, seven

00:02:02.133 --> 00:02:04.754
then right to left

00:02:04.834 --> 00:02:07.400
one

00:02:08.367 --> 00:02:12.934
two, three

00:02:14.067 --> 00:02:22.687
four, five, six, seven

00:02:22.767 --> 00:02:27.387
and then again one

00:02:27.467 --> 00:02:32.821
two, three

00:02:32.901 --> 00:02:38.287
four, five

00:02:38.367 --> 00:02:42.120
six, seven

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:48.987
and then I'll put both my hands
like this and I'll check the vibrations

00:02:49.067 --> 00:02:53.320
You might feel hot or cold: do not worry

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.554
just hold it for a while

00:02:55.634 --> 00:02:59.187
and then you do the second stage

00:02:59.267 --> 00:03:02.487
take your hand like this up

00:03:02.567 --> 00:03:05.587
At this point

00:03:05.667 --> 00:03:10.154
And then rotate clockwise

00:03:10.234 --> 00:03:14.154
two, three

00:03:14.234 --> 00:03:18.020
four, five

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.587
six, seven

00:03:20.667 --> 00:03:23.754
and then bring at this point

00:03:23.834 --> 00:03:28.387
one, two, three

00:03:28.467 --> 00:03:31.487
four, five

00:03:31.567 --> 00:03:33.254
six, seven

00:03:33.334 --> 00:03:36.254
And then move the other point. One,

00:03:36.334 --> 00:03:38.754
two, three

00:03:38.834 --> 00:03:41.521
four, five

00:03:41.601 --> 00:03:43.087
six, seven

00:03:43.167 --> 00:03:47.854
and then move again: one, three

00:03:47.934 --> 00:03:50.788
four ,five

00:03:50.868 --> 00:03:52.621
six, seven

00:03:52.701 --> 00:03:54.721
then move again, one

00:03:54.801 --> 00:03:57.120
two, three

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.421
four, five

00:03:59.501 --> 00:04:00.821
six, seven

00:04:00.901 --> 00:04:02.687
then again one

00:04:02.767 --> 00:04:04.920
two, three

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.220
four, five

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:09.421
six, seven

00:04:09.501 --> 00:04:11.587
one, two

00:04:11.667 --> 00:04:13.821
three, four

00:04:13.901 --> 00:04:15.888
five, six

00:04:15.968 --> 00:04:19.854
seven and then move here

00:04:19.934 --> 00:04:22.154
one, two

00:04:22.234 --> 00:04:24.421
three, four

00:04:24.501 --> 00:04:26.487
five, six

00:04:26.567 --> 00:04:28.287
seven and then

00:04:28.367 --> 00:04:35.020
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven,

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:43.120
then again:

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:49.187
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven,

00:04:49.267 --> 00:04:55.287
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven,

00:04:55.367 --> 00:04:59.621
and then again move in the center

00:04:59.701 --> 00:05:02.220
and then go on your back again

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:08.521
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven,

00:05:08.601 --> 00:05:16.020
then right Swadisthan: one,
two, three, four, five, six, seven,

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:23.721
then left Swadisthan: one,
two, three, four, five, six, seven,

00:05:23.801 --> 00:05:31.053
and then come in the center again
then you rotate and pull something out

00:05:31.133 --> 00:05:38.287
again rotate, pull something out, rotate, pull.

00:05:38.367 --> 00:05:43.033
Rotate and pull. You feel vibrations.

00:05:43.534 --> 00:05:55.567
You are pulling thread out of your head
and by this time you feel the vibrations.

00:06:05.067 --> 00:06:07.067
And check the vibrations.

00:06:26.467 --> 00:06:29.834
This is the result of doing this.

00:06:32.701 --> 00:06:38.387
Constant focused here, and counting

00:06:38.467 --> 00:06:44.053
So we were counting from here.
Counting at that it was written

00:06:44.133 --> 00:06:47.354
and they tell me everything was going up

00:06:47.434 --> 00:06:52.187
and it was clearing, plus it
was generating the cool vibration

00:06:52.267 --> 00:06:54.987
So when heat comes out, don't worry.

00:06:55.067 --> 00:07:00.687
After heat is coming out, the cool
vibration is coming also behind the seat

00:07:00.767 --> 00:07:05.888
so one is clearing, another
is rising, and fulfilling success.

00:07:05.968 --> 00:07:10.654
So by doing this you come more and more in balance.

00:07:10.734 --> 00:07:15.621
At least you do seven times a day.

00:07:15.701 --> 00:07:20.154
One day seven times a one day.

00:07:20.234 --> 00:07:28.821
Seven days and you get the result.
In seven days to become the balance.

00:07:28.901 --> 00:07:34.320
And then you start meditation
and you work out any problem.

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:37.920
After that you start working on individual chakras

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.854
but this is when you work here
you are working on all the chakras

00:07:42.934 --> 00:07:44.788
from lower body.

00:07:44.868 --> 00:07:48.554
All the main, the gates are here

00:07:48.634 --> 00:07:53.421
so you are opening the gates
and then by raising your Kundalini

00:07:53.501 --> 00:07:57.087
all the chakras is getting cleared

00:07:57.167 --> 00:08:02.987
and you feel comfort when you feel comfort it is easy

00:08:03.067 --> 00:08:12.788
ease and vibration that is the fruit of your work

00:08:12.868 --> 00:08:17.421
when ease comfort comes you become thoughtless.

00:08:17.501 --> 00:08:21.934
When you come thoughtless, you are in meditation.

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:35.254
This is how you start and it's then it works very fast

00:08:35.334 --> 00:08:38.154
then use this again and again this technique

00:08:38.234 --> 00:08:42.920
That's the news that you ask
them to do seven times a day

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:50.487
So that will guarantee you on
eight days that person is ready.

00:08:50.567 --> 00:08:52.521
No Doubt.

00:08:52.601 --> 00:08:58.120
There won't be any doubt that that
person is: Oh no, this is working, this is not.

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:03.821
First they do it: someone eight
days and tell us what you think.

00:09:03.901 --> 00:09:08.953
And if that person needs help, help it.

00:09:09.033 --> 00:09:12.621
Two three people get together and help one person.

00:09:12.701 --> 00:09:17.234
By doing that you are starting to
move down and lifting that person.

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:23.254
But do not think negative. Be positive

00:09:23.334 --> 00:09:26.421
Because positive energy is working through us.

00:09:26.501 --> 00:09:32.387
And mother is with us. So you have all the vibrations.

00:09:32.467 --> 00:09:35.554
When she gives you the vibrations, you utilize.

00:09:35.634 --> 00:09:39.901
You use it in you. And that's how it was.
