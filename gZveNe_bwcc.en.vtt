00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.200
I think the mind also has formed a habit.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:15.200
The whole atmosphere is charged with such ego since long

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.280
and that's why towards Sahaja Yoga also, the attitude has to be humbler,

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:25.560
much humbler, because without humility you cannot do. That's one thing you must understand.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:31.040
It's no question of you rationally saying something about it or explaining about it.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:35.200
But, you see, basically one has to be extremely humble.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.040
First of all, it's a very big privilege to get realization. You know that.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:47.040
It's a greater privilege to do it, and it's the greatest to be a Sahaja Yogi.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.560
Is a very great privilege that you have, which very few people have

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.200
and you are the ones who are chosen specially.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:02.560
But, the humility part of it is still missing about Sahaja Yoga, about Sahaja Yoga.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:15.400
Like, we should ask, "Make me a better Sahaja Yogi, a humbler Sahaja Yogi,

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.120
a compassionate Sahaja Yogi, a sweeter Sahaja Yogi.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.800
Dissolve my ego."

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:30.320
Arrogance is something that with ego you can never understand you have been arrogant.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:35.520
The way you talk to others, the way you behave towards others, you will never understand,

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.480
because there is ego.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:44.720
If you are standing in the darkness, the light is there but it is covered with something.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.000
How will you understand where is the light?

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:56.360
So, humility must be there, because you people have very developed brains, very developed,

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.400
over-developed brains and that brain can, you see, always tell you,

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:05.120
"Oh, you are better than others," you see, always.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.520
"The another one is no good and the third one is useless.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.400
You see, you are the best."

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.320
That's typical of the brain teaches, you see.

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.640
And when it starts working out,

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:23.480
it's very difficult, you see, to see that the one who is saying this is nowhere,

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:29.120
because from the point where you see, you cannot see what you are saying.

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:40.720
What you see is the whole thing as if you have to command it; you have to ask for it.

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:48.520
So, one has to develop a kind of a humility that "I have to still receive;

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.760
I have to still get it; it has to work out."

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:58.760
Now, when it comes to that kind of an attitude, then you turn round.

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.720
Turn round upon yourself.

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.320
What have you done for Sahaja Yoga?

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:09.240
One question, simple question:

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.160
what have you done for Sahaja Yoga?

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.440
How many people have you given realization?

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.880
How many people have you been able to cure?

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.960
How much peace have you got within yourself?

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.840
How much blissful are you?

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.640
How much compassion have you got?

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.720
How much forgiveness and patience you have for others?

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:53.080
How much of sharing you can do?

00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:01.200
These are the signs of sahaja yogis,

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.320
that you break your shell.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.600
You become collective.

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.680
How much do you understand others?

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.080
And how much do you understand giving [to] others?

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:20.680
What have you given to others, even on material level? Let's see.

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:29.760
These questions should be put to yourself.

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.040
On a very material level these questions are to be asked, on a very material level,

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:39.280
because the light comes down to material level.

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.920
How many people you can forgive?

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.840
So to understand Me you have to be extremely humble

00:04:53.560 --> 00:05:00.760
and if you cannot go to that level of humility you cannot see Me

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.680
and you cannot understand Me.

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:09.000
And the more you start understanding, the more humble you become, naturally, because

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.160
you know what it is.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.040
So, I have told you many a times about humility part of it,

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.080
but My experience of these countries was where I went there.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:31.120
I mean, they are very humble people, very humble about Sahaja Yoga, extremely humble they were.

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:35.040
Even the new people were very humble.

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:39.240
The language should be extremely humble language.

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:48.120
Try to read ... I don't know whose language is so humble.

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.160
Maybe Mine, I don't know.

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:59.840
But, try to read books where people speak humble language, humble way of talking.

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:04.920
You'll enjoy it, really enjoy it.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:11.000
Humility is the glory of sahaja yogis, is the only way they will grow.

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:16.200
It's like putting your roots down and down and down.

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:25.200
Now the humility is the main thing one has to understand.

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:29.200
And you’ll be surprised, the humility is called as vinay,

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:33.280
which is the quality of Shri Ganesha – Vinayaka.

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:38.280
“Vidya vinayen shobhate.” “Vidya” means “The knowledge

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:42.360
is only decorated with humility.”

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:47.280
So the humility you saw yesterday of these great artists,

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:50.240
and the great gurus who were there.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.440
So the first quality that Ganesha should give us is vinay –

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:59.920
“vinay” meaning the humility.

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:06.520
The humility is not superficial, like you go on saying

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:10.680
“sorry” or “excuse me”, “I’m afraid” -

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:13.000
not that way. It’s not watchik,

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:17.760
it’s not just lip-service, but from within

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:20.920
the humility has to come.

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:26.200
Now the humility is, of course, is always marred by ego

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:30.000
and the ego just keeps you afloat,

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:34.040
and you never understand that you have been egoistical.

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:36.720
Even when I talk about ego, people think that

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:38.960
Mother is saying about somebody else there,

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:42.680
they never think “it’s me who has this ego.”

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:46.000
So Ganesha is the killer of ego,

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:52.000
because humility is the only thing that really can neutralize your ego.

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:57.320
So for humility you have to withdraw your attention from other things.

00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:01.680
This is an extremely important thing.

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:08.680
If your attention is going to your other problems,

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:12.520
this, that, or if you are trying to come to Sahaja Yoga

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:19.280
through other channels, it’s not going to work out.

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:24.280
You have to humble down in your heart,

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:27.480
absolutely humble down.

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:32.640
He's innocent, that’s why He’s humble.

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:38.120
If you are not innocent, then you cannot be humble.

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:45.280
Sign of innocence is humility.

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:51.080
So this will create such a beautiful atmosphere in Sahaja Yoga

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:55.760
if you insist that “Am I humble in doing this?”

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:57.680
Just ask a question,

00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:02.720
“Have I been humble in doing this, or in saying this?”

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:09.000
So Shri Ganesha, who is so humble, and His ganas

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:12.120
are even more humble in a way,

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:17.920
because He won’t tolerate any gana who is not humble to Mother.

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:23.960
So these divisive methods have come through

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:28.200
the innate humility not being you.

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:31.840
If you can enjoy each and everything,

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:34.240
then you are humble.

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:42.000
If you can appreciate each and every expression,

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:46.200
then you are humble.

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:55.120
This humility is a very deep-down character,

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:59.200
because from Mooladhara it comes.

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:05.320
And that is what is Shri Ganesha.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.120
Just imagine, He has a little rat on which He moves about,

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:16.160
He doesn’t have Impala cars or Rolls Royces.

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:20.240
He just moves, with all His big stomach

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:23.520
He moves on a little rat.

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:29.480
No assertion of His powers

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:35.520
– He’s so humble, He’s so sweet.

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:39.560
And He’s the creator of all the rhythms and

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:42.400
things and vibrations.

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:47.640
Without Him, I don’t know what would be this world.

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:54.880
And that’s what we have to really appreciate everywhere,

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:58.480
instead of denouncing this, that.

00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:00.560
We have to open out ourselves.

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:05.360
With humility you open out, you penetrate, you spread.

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:13.640
Without humility you cannot, because you are objecting to everything, creating a wall.

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:19.520
Only the humility will make you spread out.

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:23.800
Today, the first day of our tour,

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:32.440
I would request you that you have to be very, very humble.

00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:38.440
Understand that humility is extremely simple,

00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:40.440
and is beautiful.

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:57.720
If you are not humble about it, and aggressive about demanding

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:01.680
what have you got out of Sahaja Yoga

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:04.120
and complaining about it all the time,

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:12.240
while not seeing what are your own punyas, what do you deserve?

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:21.640
Your Kundalini, despite every blemish, has been raised.

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:27.360
You know that. You are blessed.

00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:33.400
So instead of complaining or being aggressive,

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:38.360
you must know that it is a great ‘favour’ to you.

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:48.840
The greatest favour; that you are forgiven completely,

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:58.040
that this great blessing has been bestowed upon you.

00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:05.560
And to come up to it you have to work hard.

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:17.600
Not to feel guilty about it but to be humble, to be thankful.

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:26.400
That despite what we have done, played with ourselves completely,

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:41.280
still we are today sitting as God's Devas.

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:49.400
So, what is our decoration? It is humility.

00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:57.640
It is simplicity. Not cleverness, arrogance,

00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:11.320
putting others down, showing-off, but a complete surrender,

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:17.880
surrendering all your egoistical qualities.

00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:22.680
We have to be humble.

00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:29.520
That is our decoration, that is our certificate,

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:37.720
that is the path into the entrance of every human being,

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:47.800
that is the way we are going to be very close to the other seekers.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:55.040
To be humble, to find out ways and methods of being humble.

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:12.520
This is the key of Nirmala Vidya, how to be humble.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:23.360
By humility you will not ever say, "This is my bathroom",

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:28.200
or "This is my fruit", or "This is my food",

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:34.040
or "This is my table", and "This is my glass".

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:46.680
Innocence gives you the strength to enjoy

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:54.400
everything that is there.

00:15:54.440 --> 00:16:01.120
So, you also should not mind if there are people with bhoots.

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:08.640
If they are arrogant, try to give them bandhans

00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:12.960
try to control them through all these methods.

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:17.160
But if you think by arguing with them you will be able to manage them,

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:26.960
it's an impossibility. So try Nirmala Vidya, and that is humility,

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:33.280
which is the myelin sheath of vibrations.

00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:36.600
Like every nerve has a myelin sheath covering it,

00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:42.240
in the same way is the humility, is the myelin sheath.

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:48.920
If you are humble, you will win the battle, if you are not, we'll be lost.

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:56.480
Then the whole thing will become a joke for you, absolute joke.

00:16:56.560 --> 00:17:02.760
If you are humble, you can see the stupid, the bhoots

00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:09.440
and all the arrogant as clowns of this drama.

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:15.840
This arrogance has to go down,

00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:19.840
that we can understand why it happens.

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:23.840
That humility is very important for us;

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.880
otherwise this power cannot take you beyond.

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:31.040
Now as it is, it has crossed the Sahasrara,

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:34.680
now this power has to go higher and higher.

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:39.720
For that, first you should be humble.

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:42.800
“Humble” doesn’t mean that it should be something

00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:47.480
artificial humility of a businessman, or a politician.

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:51.440
It is a humbleness is within your heart,

00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:55.880
that “Oh God, we don’t want to understand You,

00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:57.640
You are too great.

00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:03.560
But let us know ourselves.”

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:06.600
And then you’ll be amazed that He has made you

00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:09.320
like His own image.

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:12.880
That means He has given you all the powers.

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:14.560
He has made you.

00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:19.360
When He has made you, you cannot make Him.

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:22.520
He is the Source, you cannot make Him.

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:26.360
He has made you in His own image.

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:32.560
Now, what you can do is to make others in His image.

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:37.320
My lectures should not be just for nice one evening,

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:39.960
but should be something you should try to understand.

00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:43.000
Now whatever I am saying is the truth,

00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:46.240
is the absolute truth and is a subtle thing,

00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:48.920
which none of them have said so far.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.480
Because you have got your realization,

00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:56.680
because you are Sahaja yogi, I can say this to you.

00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:59.240
May God bless you.
