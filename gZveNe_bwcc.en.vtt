00:06.320 --> 00:08.200
I think the mind also has formed a habit.

00:08.280 --> 00:15.200
The whole atmosphere is charged with such ego since long

00:15.280 --> 00:20.280
and that's why towards Sahaja Yoga also, the attitude has to be humbler,

00:20.360 --> 00:25.560
much humbler, because without humility you cannot do. That's one thing you must understand.

00:25.640 --> 00:31.040
It's no question of you rationally saying something about it or explaining about it.

00:31.120 --> 00:35.200
But, you see, basically one has to be extremely humble.

00:35.280 --> 00:41.040
First of all, it's a very big privilege to get realization. You know that.

00:41.120 --> 00:47.040
It's a greater privilege to do it, and it's the greatest to be a Sahaja Yogi.

00:47.120 --> 00:51.560
Is a very great privilege that you have, which very few people have

00:51.640 --> 00:55.200
and you are the ones who are chosen specially.

00:55.280 --> 01:02.560
But, the humility part of it is still missing about Sahaja Yoga, about Sahaja Yoga.

01:05.440 --> 01:15.400
Like, we should ask, "Make me a better Sahaja Yogi, a humbler Sahaja Yogi,

01:15.480 --> 01:19.120
a compassionate Sahaja Yogi, a sweeter Sahaja Yogi.

01:19.200 --> 01:21.800
Dissolve my ego."

01:22.600 --> 01:30.320
Arrogance is something that with ego you can never understand you have been arrogant.

01:30.400 --> 01:35.520
The way you talk to others, the way you behave towards others, you will never understand,

01:35.600 --> 01:37.480
because there is ego.

01:37.560 --> 01:44.720
If you are standing in the darkness, the light is there but it is covered with something.

01:44.800 --> 01:49.000
How will you understand where is the light?

01:49.920 --> 01:56.360
So, humility must be there, because you people have very developed brains, very developed,

01:56.440 --> 02:01.400
over-developed brains and that brain can, you see, always tell you,

02:01.480 --> 02:05.120
"Oh, you are better than others," you see, always.

02:05.200 --> 02:09.520
"The another one is no good and the third one is useless.

02:09.600 --> 02:11.400
You see, you are the best."

02:11.440 --> 02:14.320
That's typical of the brain teaches, you see.

02:14.440 --> 02:16.640
And when it starts working out,

02:16.720 --> 02:23.480
it's very difficult, you see, to see that the one who is saying this is nowhere,

02:23.560 --> 02:29.120
because from the point where you see, you cannot see what you are saying.

02:31.880 --> 02:40.720
What you see is the whole thing as if you have to command it; you have to ask for it.

02:41.640 --> 02:48.520
So, one has to develop a kind of a humility that "I have to still receive;

02:48.600 --> 02:52.760
I have to still get it; it has to work out."

02:52.840 --> 02:58.760
Now, when it comes to that kind of an attitude, then you turn round.

02:58.840 --> 03:00.720
Turn round upon yourself.

03:00.800 --> 03:03.320
What have you done for Sahaja Yoga?

03:03.400 --> 03:09.240
One question, simple question:

03:10.400 --> 03:15.160
what have you done for Sahaja Yoga?

03:21.760 --> 03:26.440
How many people have you given realization?

03:28.000 --> 03:32.880
How many people have you been able to cure?

03:34.160 --> 03:37.960
How much peace have you got within yourself?

03:38.040 --> 03:40.840
How much blissful are you?

03:40.920 --> 03:44.640
How much compassion have you got?

03:44.720 --> 03:48.720
How much forgiveness and patience you have for others?

03:48.800 --> 03:53.080
How much of sharing you can do?

03:54.120 --> 04:01.200
These are the signs of sahaja yogis,

04:01.280 --> 04:03.320
that you break your shell.

04:03.400 --> 04:05.600
You become collective.

04:07.600 --> 04:10.680
How much do you understand others?

04:10.760 --> 04:15.080
And how much do you understand giving [to] others?

04:15.160 --> 04:20.680
What have you given to others, even on material level? Let's see.

04:26.640 --> 04:29.760
These questions should be put to yourself.

04:29.840 --> 04:34.040
On a very material level these questions are to be asked, on a very material level,

04:34.120 --> 04:39.280
because the light comes down to material level.

04:39.360 --> 04:43.920
How many people you can forgive?

04:45.000 --> 04:49.840
So to understand Me you have to be extremely humble

04:53.560 --> 05:00.760
and if you cannot go to that level of humility you cannot see Me

05:00.840 --> 05:04.680
and you cannot understand Me.

05:04.760 --> 05:09.000
And the more you start understanding, the more humble you become, naturally, because

05:09.080 --> 05:12.160
you know what it is.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.040
So, I have told you many a times about humility part of it,

05:17.120 --> 05:21.080
but My experience of these countries was where I went there.

05:21.160 --> 05:31.120
I mean, they are very humble people, very humble about Sahaja Yoga, extremely humble they were.

05:31.440 --> 05:35.040
Even the new people were very humble.

05:35.120 --> 05:39.240
The language should be extremely humble language.

05:39.320 --> 05:48.120
Try to read ... I don't know whose language is so humble.

05:49.360 --> 05:52.160
Maybe Mine, I don't know.

05:52.240 --> 05:59.840
But, try to read books where people speak humble language, humble way of talking.

05:59.920 --> 06:04.920
You'll enjoy it, really enjoy it.

06:05.000 --> 06:11.000
Humility is the glory of sahaja yogis, is the only way they will grow.

06:11.320 --> 06:16.200
It's like putting your roots down and down and down.

06:20.360 --> 06:25.200
Now the humility is the main thing one has to understand.

06:25.360 --> 06:29.200
And you’ll be surprised, the humility is called as vinay,

06:29.280 --> 06:33.280
which is the quality of Shri Ganesha – Vinayaka.

06:33.360 --> 06:38.280
“Vidya vinayen shobhate.” “Vidya” means “The knowledge

06:38.360 --> 06:42.360
is only decorated with humility.”

06:43.040 --> 06:47.280
So the humility you saw yesterday of these great artists,

06:47.360 --> 06:50.240
and the great gurus who were there.

06:51.000 --> 06:56.440
So the first quality that Ganesha should give us is vinay –

06:56.520 --> 06:59.920
“vinay” meaning the humility.

07:01.800 --> 07:06.520
The humility is not superficial, like you go on saying

07:06.600 --> 07:10.680
“sorry” or “excuse me”, “I’m afraid” -

07:10.760 --> 07:13.000
not that way. It’s not watchik,

07:13.080 --> 07:17.760
it’s not just lip-service, but from within

07:17.840 --> 07:20.920
the humility has to come.

07:21.360 --> 07:26.200
Now the humility is, of course, is always marred by ego

07:26.320 --> 07:30.000
and the ego just keeps you afloat,

07:30.080 --> 07:34.040
and you never understand that you have been egoistical.

07:34.440 --> 07:36.720
Even when I talk about ego, people think that

07:36.800 --> 07:38.960
Mother is saying about somebody else there,

07:39.040 --> 07:42.680
they never think “it’s me who has this ego.”

07:42.760 --> 07:46.000
So Ganesha is the killer of ego,

07:46.080 --> 07:52.000
because humility is the only thing that really can neutralize your ego.

07:52.120 --> 07:57.320
So for humility you have to withdraw your attention from other things.

07:57.720 --> 08:01.680
This is an extremely important thing.

08:03.680 --> 08:08.680
If your attention is going to your other problems,

08:08.760 --> 08:12.520
this, that, or if you are trying to come to Sahaja Yoga

08:12.600 --> 08:19.280
through other channels, it’s not going to work out.

08:19.760 --> 08:24.280
You have to humble down in your heart,

08:25.160 --> 08:27.480
absolutely humble down.

08:27.560 --> 08:32.640
He's innocent, that’s why He’s humble.

08:33.280 --> 08:38.120
If you are not innocent, then you cannot be humble.

08:38.800 --> 08:45.280
Sign of innocence is humility.

08:46.240 --> 08:51.080
So this will create such a beautiful atmosphere in Sahaja Yoga

08:51.160 --> 08:55.760
if you insist that “Am I humble in doing this?”

08:55.880 --> 08:57.680
Just ask a question,

08:57.760 --> 09:02.720
“Have I been humble in doing this, or in saying this?”

09:04.360 --> 09:09.000
So Shri Ganesha, who is so humble, and His ganas

09:09.080 --> 09:12.120
are even more humble in a way,

09:12.240 --> 09:17.920
because He won’t tolerate any gana who is not humble to Mother.

09:18.160 --> 09:23.960
So these divisive methods have come through

09:24.200 --> 09:28.200
the innate humility not being you.

09:28.800 --> 09:31.840
If you can enjoy each and everything,

09:32.040 --> 09:34.240
then you are humble.

09:36.960 --> 09:42.000
If you can appreciate each and every expression,

09:42.760 --> 09:46.200
then you are humble.

09:50.480 --> 09:55.120
This humility is a very deep-down character,

09:55.200 --> 09:59.200
because from Mooladhara it comes.

10:02.280 --> 10:05.320
And that is what is Shri Ganesha.

10:06.000 --> 10:10.120
Just imagine, He has a little rat on which He moves about,

10:10.200 --> 10:16.160
He doesn’t have Impala cars or Rolls Royces.

10:17.360 --> 10:20.240
He just moves, with all His big stomach

10:20.320 --> 10:23.520
He moves on a little rat.

10:24.640 --> 10:29.480
No assertion of His powers

10:29.560 --> 10:35.520
– He’s so humble, He’s so sweet.

10:37.400 --> 10:39.560
And He’s the creator of all the rhythms and

10:39.640 --> 10:42.400
things and vibrations.

10:42.480 --> 10:47.640
Without Him, I don’t know what would be this world.

10:48.840 --> 10:54.880
And that’s what we have to really appreciate everywhere,

10:55.240 --> 10:58.480
instead of denouncing this, that.

10:58.560 --> 11:00.560
We have to open out ourselves.

11:00.640 --> 11:05.360
With humility you open out, you penetrate, you spread.

11:05.440 --> 11:13.640
Without humility you cannot, because you are objecting to everything, creating a wall.

11:13.720 --> 11:19.520
Only the humility will make you spread out.

11:19.920 --> 11:23.800
Today, the first day of our tour,

11:24.640 --> 11:32.440
I would request you that you have to be very, very humble.

11:32.520 --> 11:38.440
Understand that humility is extremely simple,

11:38.520 --> 11:40.440
and is beautiful.

11:44.880 --> 11:57.720
If you are not humble about it, and aggressive about demanding

11:59.320 --> 12:01.680
what have you got out of Sahaja Yoga

12:01.760 --> 12:04.120
and complaining about it all the time,

12:04.240 --> 12:12.240
while not seeing what are your own punyas, what do you deserve?

12:14.200 --> 12:21.640
Your Kundalini, despite every blemish, has been raised.

12:21.800 --> 12:27.360
You know that. You are blessed.

12:29.320 --> 12:33.400
So instead of complaining or being aggressive,

12:33.600 --> 12:38.360
you must know that it is a great ‘favour’ to you.

12:40.840 --> 12:48.840
The greatest favour; that you are forgiven completely,

12:53.160 --> 12:58.040
that this great blessing has been bestowed upon you.

12:58.200 --> 13:05.560
And to come up to it you have to work hard.

13:09.240 --> 13:17.600
Not to feel guilty about it but to be humble, to be thankful.

13:19.320 --> 13:26.400
That despite what we have done, played with ourselves completely,

13:32.720 --> 13:41.280
still we are today sitting as God's Devas.

13:41.480 --> 13:49.400
So, what is our decoration? It is humility.

13:50.640 --> 13:57.640
It is simplicity. Not cleverness, arrogance,

14:02.640 --> 14:11.320
putting others down, showing-off, but a complete surrender,

14:14.480 --> 14:17.880
surrendering all your egoistical qualities.

14:19.520 --> 14:22.680
We have to be humble.

14:22.760 --> 14:29.520
That is our decoration, that is our certificate,

14:30.120 --> 14:37.720
that is the path into the entrance of every human being,

14:39.080 --> 14:47.800
that is the way we are going to be very close to the other seekers.

14:48.000 --> 14:55.040
To be humble, to find out ways and methods of being humble.

14:59.040 --> 15:12.520
This is the key of Nirmala Vidya, how to be humble.

15:15.000 --> 15:23.360
By humility you will not ever say, "This is my bathroom",

15:23.520 --> 15:28.200
or "This is my fruit", or "This is my food",

15:28.400 --> 15:34.040
or "This is my table", and "This is my glass".

15:36.800 --> 15:46.680
Innocence gives you the strength to enjoy

15:50.840 --> 15:54.400
everything that is there.

15:54.440 --> 16:01.120
So, you also should not mind if there are people with bhoots.

16:01.360 --> 16:08.640
If they are arrogant, try to give them bandhans

16:08.880 --> 16:12.960
try to control them through all these methods.

16:13.040 --> 16:17.160
But if you think by arguing with them you will be able to manage them,

16:17.400 --> 16:26.960
it's an impossibility. So try Nirmala Vidya, and that is humility,

16:27.720 --> 16:33.280
which is the myelin sheath of vibrations.

16:33.560 --> 16:36.600
Like every nerve has a myelin sheath covering it,

16:36.680 --> 16:42.240
in the same way is the humility, is the myelin sheath.

16:42.320 --> 16:48.920
If you are humble, you will win the battle, if you are not, we'll be lost.

16:50.400 --> 16:56.480
Then the whole thing will become a joke for you, absolute joke.

16:56.560 --> 17:02.760
If you are humble, you can see the stupid, the bhoots

17:02.920 --> 17:09.440
and all the arrogant as clowns of this drama.

17:12.640 --> 17:15.840
This arrogance has to go down,

17:16.120 --> 17:19.840
that we can understand why it happens.

17:20.240 --> 17:23.840
That humility is very important for us;

17:24.000 --> 17:27.880
otherwise this power cannot take you beyond.

17:28.240 --> 17:31.040
Now as it is, it has crossed the Sahasrara,

17:31.200 --> 17:34.680
now this power has to go higher and higher.

17:34.920 --> 17:39.720
For that, first you should be humble.

17:40.160 --> 17:42.800
“Humble” doesn’t mean that it should be something

17:42.880 --> 17:47.480
artificial humility of a businessman, or a politician.

17:47.840 --> 17:51.440
It is a humbleness is within your heart,

17:51.920 --> 17:55.880
that “Oh God, we don’t want to understand You,

17:55.960 --> 17:57.640
You are too great.

17:57.800 --> 18:03.560
But let us know ourselves.”

18:03.880 --> 18:06.600
And then you’ll be amazed that He has made you

18:06.800 --> 18:09.320
like His own image.

18:09.400 --> 18:12.880
That means He has given you all the powers.

18:13.160 --> 18:14.560
He has made you.

18:14.920 --> 18:19.360
When He has made you, you cannot make Him.

18:19.440 --> 18:22.520
He is the Source, you cannot make Him.

18:23.040 --> 18:26.360
He has made you in His own image.

18:26.440 --> 18:32.560
Now, what you can do is to make others in His image.

18:33.680 --> 18:37.320
My lectures should not be just for nice one evening,

18:37.400 --> 18:39.960
but should be something you should try to understand.

18:40.040 --> 18:43.000
Now whatever I am saying is the truth,

18:43.240 --> 18:46.240
is the absolute truth and is a subtle thing,

18:46.320 --> 18:48.920
which none of them have said so far.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.480
Because you have got your realization,

18:51.560 --> 18:56.680
because you are Sahaja yogi, I can say this to you.

18:56.760 --> 18:59.240
May God bless you.
