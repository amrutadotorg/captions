00:10:55.420 --> 00:12:09.149
Very happy to be back here in Melbourne, after
such a long gap, and everybody's grown up

00:12:09.149 --> 00:13:02.480
so much; nice to see you all so healthy, beautiful
and joyous.

00:13:02.480 --> 00:17:17.000
Of course I feel sad about the ashram that
we have lost, that we should not have lost

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:32.250
the ashram.

00:17:32.250 --> 00:20:50.250
But whatever has happened you can't help it;
but it's important for Sahaja Yoga that we

00:20:50.250 --> 00:21:03.350
have to live together.

00:21:03.350 --> 00:22:15.240
I also told the same thing in Perth, that
try to get a big place, because you know your

00:22:15.240 --> 00:23:04.550
children are there, and you all are there,
and if you are together, negativity runs away.

00:23:04.550 --> 00:23:38.520
It has such a tremendous force, an ashram
has a tremendous force.

00:23:38.520 --> 00:24:08.159
When you live together, you help each other,
you understand each other, you know so many

00:24:08.159 --> 00:24:24.510
things, you learn so many things from each
other and, it could be done very easily, once

00:24:24.510 --> 00:24:30.380
you start enjoying the collectivity.

00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:31.620
Human being is a social being.

00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:40.100
He is not a person who wants to live in a
-- single way.

00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:46.909
That's why if you jail someone, if somebody's
in jail, it becomes a punishment.

00:24:46.909 --> 00:24:54.790
Though in the jail you have all the conveniences,
everything is there, on the contrary you don't

00:24:54.790 --> 00:25:02.240
have to work so hard, you get your food all
right, everything is fine, somebody cooks

00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:06.929
for you.

00:25:06.929 --> 00:25:12.420
But it's a punishment.

00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:32.879
And for our ascent is very important to be
collective.

00:25:32.879 --> 00:25:38.540
It's said that wherever you are together I
reside there[with you?].

00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:42.580
But human nature is funny.

00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:47.129
In some places collectivity has acted very
well, like in Austria and we have the best

00:25:47.129 --> 00:25:48.129
ashram in Austria.

00:25:48.129 --> 00:25:55.669
Now they have about five, six ashrams there,
one better than the other.

00:25:55.669 --> 00:26:03.869
In itself in Vienna we have I think four ashrams,
and it's growing so well.

00:26:03.869 --> 00:26:10.760
Nobody wants to live alone, so anxious to
join, come back to ashrams; and so many problems

00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:14.220
are solved otherwise also on very material
level.

00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:18.830
Everything gets shared, you don't have to
pay too much money.

00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:27.980
Now if you are living alone, then sometimes
you feel like spending your money here, there

00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:32.059
and at the end of the day no money is left
out.

00:26:32.059 --> 00:26:36.270
But in the ashram you know how much to pay.

00:26:36.270 --> 00:26:43.100
Then there are some people who want to buy
-- I mean on a material level -- something

00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:51.630
very exorbitant, something great and this
and that, and nobody to control that, that

00:26:51.630 --> 00:26:53.160
desire that need.

00:26:53.160 --> 00:27:04.500
As a result, we become extravagant, so much
so that you are left with nothing.

00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:07.409
Exactly this happened in Perth.

00:27:07.409 --> 00:27:13.740
I know of people who had money, and when they
took their houses and they're living there,

00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:17.110
they have no money at all.

00:27:17.110 --> 00:27:18.800
I said, 'Why?'

00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:25.879
He said, 'For food we spend so much and then
need to go and get this and do this,' and

00:27:25.879 --> 00:27:34.450
the whole day they are busy working it out
-- on individual basis.

00:27:34.450 --> 00:27:35.450
There's no time for meditation.

00:27:35.450 --> 00:27:42.140
There's no time for listening to My tapes,
no time for anything.

00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:46.610
And everybody has gone down so much in vibrations
there that I was really shocked.

00:27:46.610 --> 00:27:50.610
Perth was one of the places I felt was a very
good place.

00:27:50.610 --> 00:27:59.490
It's so open and so clean and so nice; and
what are you doing -- going out shopping,

00:27:59.490 --> 00:28:05.970
buying this cloth, that cloth, this dress,
that dress and piles in the house, because

00:28:05.970 --> 00:28:07.730
that fashion was the other day.

00:28:07.730 --> 00:28:11.150
In Sahaja Yoga there's a Sahaja fashion.

00:28:11.150 --> 00:28:17.080
We don't change our dresses every day in Sahaja
Yoga.

00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:19.890
Every year we buy whatever is needed.

00:28:19.890 --> 00:28:20.890
That's all.

00:28:20.890 --> 00:28:25.179
And Australia specially, being such an expensive
place, I mean, I think this is one of the

00:28:25.179 --> 00:28:28.849
most expensive nations I've seen -- the most
expensive.

00:28:28.849 --> 00:28:35.890
First I used to think Helsinki, Finland is
the most expensive but now I've gone just

00:28:35.890 --> 00:28:43.990
to buy these shoes, I've walked for hours
together to get the pair of shoes here.

00:28:43.990 --> 00:28:47.480
In India you can get it in no time and I've
paid at least three times more that I would

00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:53.730
pay, even in London and at least four times
more that I would pay in Italy.

00:28:53.730 --> 00:28:58.009
In India I need not tell, you know that very
well.

00:28:58.009 --> 00:29:03.179
So if you -see it's a kind of a time that
you have that if you start doing this, doing

00:29:03.179 --> 00:29:04.179
that.

00:29:04.179 --> 00:29:09.490
And the essence of all that is what?

00:29:09.490 --> 00:29:10.929
Is to please others.

00:29:10.929 --> 00:29:17.879
We buy good clothes to please others; want
to have nice curios to please others; want

00:29:17.879 --> 00:29:25.520
to decorate our house to please others; we
don't do it for ourselves, do we?

00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:32.639
So then there is not the other -- like we
were staying in London and there were seven

00:29:32.639 --> 00:29:41.730
houses, and everybody was busy you see, cleaning,
sweeping, swabbing, doing all the lawns, everything

00:29:41.730 --> 00:29:46.909
and polishing all the brass and everything
in those houses.

00:29:46.909 --> 00:29:49.060
But not even a rat would enter that house.

00:29:49.060 --> 00:29:51.099
I said, 'For whom are they doing it?

00:29:51.099 --> 00:29:52.099
I don't know'.

00:29:52.099 --> 00:29:58.310
Poor things, they are working so hard, nobody
to see it.

00:29:58.310 --> 00:30:05.070
And that's how they become extremely depressed
and unhappy.

00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:10.530
This depression you don't find among Indians
at all because their houses are open, anybody

00:30:10.530 --> 00:30:11.530
can walk in, have food, walk out.

00:30:11.530 --> 00:30:18.139
You will not know whose house, to whom it
belongs.

00:30:18.139 --> 00:30:21.580
Then this depression walks in.

00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:25.910
Is a psychological thing, because human beings
are social beings.

00:30:25.910 --> 00:30:28.060
You must understand the essence of [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:31.550
You can never be happy living alone.

00:30:31.550 --> 00:30:36.820
And this aloofness and this individualism
has brought this kind of a new thing which

00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:44.680
we call as tensions and as depressions and
then go to schizophrenia.

00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:50.180
There's not a single case of schizophrenia
I have seen in India -- not a single case.

00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:57.210
Ah some people become lunatics but lunatics
are there and they are put in the jail.

00:30:57.210 --> 00:30:58.210
There are very few lunatics.

00:30:58.210 --> 00:31:02.790
Now, in England the lunatics are so many,
and so many schizophrenics that they have

00:31:02.790 --> 00:31:06.170
said: "Now we'll not have any more, let them
be with the society.

00:31:06.170 --> 00:31:09.300
If they live with the society they'll be all
right".

00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:14.670
So now they are starting a society of people
who would like to stay with lunatics and the

00:31:14.670 --> 00:31:17.080
lunatics have improved, living with society.

00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:23.300
Even here they will start after some time,
that allow the lunatics to live with the people.

00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:26.159
Talk to them nicely.

00:31:26.159 --> 00:31:28.370
Because, how do we live?

00:31:28.370 --> 00:31:30.780
With love, with rapport.

00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:33.190
We can't live alone.

00:31:33.190 --> 00:31:44.680
That's a little bit of a, idea we have that,
'This is my house, this is my this thing,

00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:46.690
this is my...'

00:31:46.690 --> 00:31:54.659
But you rise above a little bit and then you'll
say, 'It's so nice to decorate the ashram,

00:31:54.659 --> 00:31:55.900
it's for everyone.'

00:31:55.900 --> 00:32:01.669
Do good to others, so everybody says, 'What
a nice thing it is'.

00:32:01.669 --> 00:32:04.179
Now see such a nice house [man's name?] has
got.

00:32:04.179 --> 00:32:06.680
If he had not come you would not have seen
it.

00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:15.270
She would have worked so hard, poor thing,
nobody would have appreciated it.

00:32:15.270 --> 00:32:22.190
And this idea of 'my-ness' and 'I-ness' has
to be given up in Sahaja Yoga, then you will

00:32:22.190 --> 00:32:26.560
know what is joy is; and then you will write
to Me, 'Mother, we are all swimming in the

00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:28.020
Ocean of Joy'.

00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:34.520
Matter is just -- you know you'll be surprised
-- matter is only for expression of love and

00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:35.520
for nothing else.

00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:42.619
They all call Me very generous but you don't
know I am very selfish because I enjoy Myself

00:32:42.619 --> 00:32:46.919
by giving it to others, that's the greatest
enjoyment for Me.

00:32:46.919 --> 00:32:52.679
But this time I had gathered so many things
for you, and they told Me, 'Don't bring anything

00:32:52.679 --> 00:32:54.290
to Australia'.

00:32:54.290 --> 00:33:01.050
Look at this country -- funny one -- they
don't allow any presents to be brought here

00:33:01.050 --> 00:33:05.170
for people whom I want to give and enjoy My
generosity.

00:33:05.170 --> 00:33:11.190
So that is what it is that when we understand
the essence, now we are on the essence because

00:33:11.190 --> 00:33:13.690
we are on the Kundalini.

00:33:13.690 --> 00:33:15.960
Then we must know the essence of joy.

00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:22.429
And the joy is in sharing.

00:33:22.429 --> 00:33:27.580
But here people share which should not be
shared, their privacy.

00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:32.440
Where they have to be private they are not.

00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:33.929
Just the other way round.

00:33:33.929 --> 00:33:38.480
I shouldn't say that but is a fact you know
it for definite.

00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:43.159
You see even Mrs. Thatcher said that, 'It's
our culture that women must expose their body.'

00:33:43.159 --> 00:33:44.159
Can you imagine Mrs. Thatcher saying that?

00:33:44.159 --> 00:33:52.090
But I heard with My Own ears.

00:33:52.090 --> 00:33:58.609
So whatever is to be shared is not shared,
whatever is not to be shared is shared, and

00:33:58.609 --> 00:33:59.830
if you say, 'Why are you sharing?'

00:33:59.830 --> 00:34:07.250
'You are jealous, you are very small-minded,
you are very narrow-minded, you are very selfish'.

00:34:07.250 --> 00:34:13.889
As Sahaja Yogis you can see it because you
have the witness power, you can see it clearly.

00:34:13.889 --> 00:34:19.000
You have that Divine eyesight, you can see
that clearly, that this is this thing, just

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:22.929
the opposite.

00:34:22.929 --> 00:34:30.980
Of course you don't have to take sannyasa.

00:34:30.980 --> 00:34:37.919
You don't have to do all these stupid things,
but you have to enjoy the collectivity.

00:34:37.919 --> 00:34:40.870
This is the culture of Sahaja Yoga.

00:34:40.870 --> 00:34:48.270
And now if you people cannot live together,
how do I expect the whole world to live together?

00:34:48.270 --> 00:34:54.590
Of course there are problems, because of our
ideas, not because there's something wrong

00:34:54.590 --> 00:34:55.590
with collectivity.

00:34:55.590 --> 00:35:01.079
I told them this morning the same thing I
would like to tell you: that the first thing

00:35:01.079 --> 00:35:07.030
is when we start looking at others we try
to gather the thorns, 'What's wrong with that

00:35:07.030 --> 00:35:10.780
another person,' instead of gathering the
flowers.

00:35:10.780 --> 00:35:16.650
If you want to gather the thorns, all right,
go ahead.

00:35:16.650 --> 00:35:17.710
I mean how can you get flowers then?

00:35:17.710 --> 00:35:18.710
As simple as that.

00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:19.710
It's a very simple mathematics.

00:35:19.710 --> 00:35:27.090
But if you want to have flowers you should
see to the beauty of another person, glory

00:35:27.090 --> 00:35:30.329
of another person, the better side of it.

00:35:30.329 --> 00:35:34.130
And those who cannot see it, can never enjoy
another person.

00:35:34.130 --> 00:35:40.040
And the Sahaja Yogis can enjoy each other
very well.

00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:42.800
It's so sweet it is and so beautiful that
you all can live together like that.

00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:46.020
I wish I could, all the time, with you all.

00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:56.060
But it's not in My Fate I have to travel from
one place to another.

00:35:56.060 --> 00:35:57.060
I left them there.

00:35:57.060 --> 00:36:04.040
I was so much wrenched in My Heart really
and I was so heavy that I just closed My eyes

00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:10.930
trying to get over it; and there I find all
the flowers smiling at Me at the airport and

00:36:10.930 --> 00:36:11.960
whole thing finished.

00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:12.960
Neutralized.

00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:14.700
I said, 'Now these were also waiting.

00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:18.550
After all I have to come for them, here.'

00:36:18.550 --> 00:36:26.880
So you see this love, this affection, this
deeper understanding that we have, within

00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:34.330
ourselves, that we are in love with each other,
where can we express?

00:36:34.330 --> 00:36:39.260
In a house which is separate, the housewife
is busy with the household, man is busy with

00:36:39.260 --> 00:36:40.260
another thing.

00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:46.089
But doing it together is such a beauty, and
that's what has happened to Australia today.

00:36:46.089 --> 00:36:53.980
As it is Australia is such a cut-off place,
from the whole world, is more necessary that

00:36:53.980 --> 00:36:56.980
you should ask for collectivity here.

00:36:56.980 --> 00:37:03.320
Even to come, even from Perth to here took
three hours for us; such a vast country so

00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:04.730
separated from each other.

00:37:04.730 --> 00:37:11.660
When you are separated you come closer to
each other, very much more.

00:37:11.660 --> 00:37:17.550
Try to understand your essence and I think
now your attitudes will change and next time

00:37:17.550 --> 00:37:20.349
I should come to an ashram here.

00:37:20.349 --> 00:37:21.349
That's what I want.

00:37:21.349 --> 00:37:24.580
All of you if you work it out you can do it.

00:37:24.580 --> 00:37:27.500
After all there is paramachaitanya working
on it.

00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:34.720
But is a common case with people that they
don't want to live collectively.

00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:35.920
It's very common case.

00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:43.830
But those who enjoy, you see, their Spirit
cannot enjoy life without living together.

00:37:43.830 --> 00:37:47.140
Because Spirit is the collective being.

00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:48.460
It is a collective being.

00:37:48.460 --> 00:37:51.890
It's nature it is a collective being.

00:37:51.890 --> 00:37:54.599
That's the trouble.

00:37:54.599 --> 00:37:56.460
So you can't be in the water as well as in
the boat.

00:37:56.460 --> 00:38:12.740
And either you have to be spiritually inclined,
or you should be in the Spirit or in the body.

00:38:12.740 --> 00:38:15.130
And for your ascent is very important.

00:38:15.130 --> 00:38:22.730
We have to establish very good ashrams, where
you can also have a center down below or something.

00:38:22.730 --> 00:38:27.089
All of you put together can manage that, I
know that very well.

00:38:27.089 --> 00:38:32.110
If it is decided you can do it.

00:38:32.110 --> 00:38:33.219
If you need any help I am willing to help
you.

00:38:33.219 --> 00:38:34.219
This Kew thing, I don't know why it fizzled
out.

00:38:34.219 --> 00:38:36.350
The man became very greedy or whatever it
is.

00:38:36.350 --> 00:38:42.609
But this was a very beautiful place, I enjoyed
it very much thoroughly there.

00:38:42.609 --> 00:38:48.870
Also sometimes it happens that somebody becomes
despotic, somebody becomes dictatorial, some

00:38:48.870 --> 00:38:52.110
things happen like that, but it will pass
out.

00:38:52.110 --> 00:38:55.780
But once you break away, it will be difficult
for you to come together.

00:38:55.780 --> 00:39:00.000
You'll find excuses, 'I have got this work',
the another will say, 'I have that job', 'I

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.329
have to do this'.

00:39:02.329 --> 00:39:05.670
Everything can be done collectively much better.

00:39:05.670 --> 00:39:10.570
Just now see I was talking to him, one minute,
before, but I didn't know what he was doing.

00:39:10.570 --> 00:39:11.570
I said, 'What do you do?'

00:39:11.570 --> 00:39:12.570
He said, 'Government service,' 'What kind?'

00:39:12.570 --> 00:39:13.570
He said, 'Immigration.'

00:39:13.570 --> 00:39:15.490
I said, 'That's it.

00:39:15.490 --> 00:39:18.530
I wanted you.'

00:39:18.530 --> 00:39:24.030
Not for My immigration, but for John Watkinson,
and he's worrying Me too much because poor

00:39:24.030 --> 00:39:29.200
fellow, John Watkinson, you know; you know
John Watkinson very well -- how beautifully

00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:33.210
he works out everything, you know that very
well.

00:39:33.210 --> 00:39:34.210
And he's in trouble.

00:39:34.210 --> 00:39:35.619
He can't get his wife in England.

00:39:35.619 --> 00:39:36.619
So I want him to immigrate here.

00:39:36.619 --> 00:39:40.010
I was talking to him and he gave Me very good
idea.

00:39:40.010 --> 00:39:46.920
Supposing we were not together, I would not
have done anything.

00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:52.730
Immediately you see, as soon as a problem
comes up, they say, 'All right, so this place,

00:39:52.730 --> 00:39:57.359
there is someone like that, Mother can we
take her?'

00:39:57.359 --> 00:39:59.290
All over the world we have people.

00:39:59.290 --> 00:40:02.839
It's like one big body.

00:40:02.839 --> 00:40:07.220
And as soon as there's problem with the eyes,
some hand is there to help us.

00:40:07.220 --> 00:40:09.080
That's how we are going to work it out.

00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:13.640
Do you understand the importance of Sahaja
Yoga, at this juncture?

00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:23.310
It's not 'by the way', it's very important,
extremely important thing.

00:40:23.310 --> 00:40:27.119
I don't know if you really know about it.

00:40:27.119 --> 00:40:32.050
Such work was never done in the history of
Spirituality, in the history of this world,

00:40:32.050 --> 00:40:34.040
or universe whatsoever.

00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:39.020
And this kind of a masse transformation that
is taking place, which is going to transform

00:40:39.020 --> 00:40:40.810
the whole world.

00:40:40.810 --> 00:40:43.650
But just the opposite of us are Russians.

00:40:43.650 --> 00:40:46.250
Russians are tremendous people.

00:40:46.250 --> 00:40:51.940
Now we have a house, big, huge house, in Russia.

00:40:51.940 --> 00:40:58.971
I've been there only twice, once for eight
days, another time for two days, and they

00:40:58.971 --> 00:41:06.610
are so dynamic and so spiritually evolved,
I cannot describe to you, when I went there

00:41:06.610 --> 00:41:11.380
in Leningrad, there were two thousand people
inside the hall, and two thousand sitting

00:41:11.380 --> 00:41:15.380
outside, and I didn't know what to do with
them.

00:41:15.380 --> 00:41:21.420
After all lecture, program -- it lasted for
two hours or so, two and a half hours, when

00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:27.790
I came out all two thousand were still outside
waiting.

00:41:27.790 --> 00:41:28.790
It touched My Heart really.

00:41:28.790 --> 00:41:29.900
Said: 'But Mother what about us?'

00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:35.360
I said: 'All right, tomorrow you come along
here outside I'll see you, all of you, I must

00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:36.800
meet you tomorrow.'

00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:41.869
So the two thousand who were inside and the
two thousand who were outside -- all were

00:41:41.869 --> 00:41:45.630
there on the grounds and all of them are there
now in Sahaja Yoga.

00:41:45.630 --> 00:41:48.650
The follow-up we had to take in the same hall.

00:41:48.650 --> 00:41:53.860
Now they've found a house for us, anything
you want.

00:41:53.860 --> 00:41:57.990
Even their ministers.

00:41:57.990 --> 00:42:00.079
They gave us an independent chart.

00:42:00.079 --> 00:42:04.930
There's no organization from outside Russia
has got an independent chart.

00:42:04.930 --> 00:42:06.390
We can do what we like.

00:42:06.390 --> 00:42:09.355
They are willing to pay for My ticket, for
the ticket who comes with Me and they are

00:42:09.355 --> 00:42:15.859
going to pay for My hotels and they are going
to do everything.

00:42:15.859 --> 00:42:24.720
Tremendous personality and they might one
day become the greatest Spiritual people -- the

00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:26.490
way they are.

00:42:26.490 --> 00:42:32.480
But they had to learn collectivity through
their training of communism, that has come

00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:33.480
handy.

00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:37.890
Though there are many defects of communism
no doubt, but the greatest advantage they

00:42:37.890 --> 00:42:41.840
had is the collectivity; to know to share.

00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:43.660
And that's why it has worked.

00:42:43.660 --> 00:42:45.160
I've been thinking "Why is it so much?"

00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:50.440
Of course they have no conditioning of religions
and things, they all divide us, religions

00:42:50.440 --> 00:42:52.119
this that.

00:42:52.119 --> 00:42:55.580
But there is one thing that is so great about
them is that they are very collectively conscious.

00:42:55.580 --> 00:43:05.150
I mean we all went there, forty-five of them
just jumped in, from all over the world to

00:43:05.150 --> 00:43:09.530
come to Russia because very interesting now.

00:43:09.530 --> 00:43:11.790
You won't believe they looked after us like
lords, gave them food, this, make all arrangements.

00:43:11.790 --> 00:43:18.000
Where My program was there was a big dinner
they threw; not a single pie we had to pay

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:19.000
them.

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:27.090
I mean there was no organization there, nothing;
no Sahaja Yoga, nothing.

00:43:27.090 --> 00:43:38.099
Only Oleg was there; nothing in Leningrad-
and Oleg was actually in Moscow, and even

00:43:38.099 --> 00:43:49.150
to touch the platform on which I was sitting
there was a big cue and when I went away also

00:43:49.150 --> 00:43:53.180
they were touching the platform, can you imagine.

00:43:53.180 --> 00:43:56.030
They said: "We have never heard of such a
thing, it's such a great thing.

00:43:56.030 --> 00:44:02.424
I cannot believe it there such a thing exists."

00:44:02.424 --> 00:44:04.530
And they're all very well-educated people.

00:44:04.530 --> 00:44:15.170
They are scientists, lots of scientists, doctors,
architects, businessmen, all kinds of things.

00:44:15.170 --> 00:44:18.069
And the ministers of the Supreme Council.

00:44:18.069 --> 00:44:19.690
What do you say?

00:44:19.690 --> 00:44:21.240
They came to my program.

00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:23.119
They all touched My Feet.

00:44:23.119 --> 00:44:25.830
I said: "What world is this?"

00:44:25.830 --> 00:44:35.089
And they haven't got this sense that you are
a minister or anything; everybody just the

00:44:35.089 --> 00:44:36.089
same.

00:44:36.089 --> 00:44:39.280
Of course that's the thanks to communism.

00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:50.030
But communism has given them something very
very great and that is collectivity; they

00:44:50.030 --> 00:44:54.270
know how to share.

00:44:54.270 --> 00:45:05.519
I just really didn't know to really measure
out their potential, really, I couldn't make

00:45:05.519 --> 00:45:06.519
out.

00:45:06.519 --> 00:45:09.150
They're all waiting for Me there.

00:45:09.150 --> 00:45:13.759
They made a film out of Me already, and they
showed it and all the film had nothing but

00:45:13.759 --> 00:45:19.220
vibrations and some light tuck tuck on people
and all that.

00:45:19.220 --> 00:45:21.569
So that film became very popular, they made
a lot of money out of that.

00:45:21.569 --> 00:45:29.490
All that they have given to Sahaja Yoga now.

00:45:29.490 --> 00:45:31.749
And first only they brought lot of money I
said: "Why?

00:45:31.749 --> 00:45:32.749
For what?"

00:45:32.749 --> 00:45:33.749
They said: "For Sahaja Yoga."

00:45:33.749 --> 00:45:35.509
I said: "I don't need any money just now."

00:45:35.509 --> 00:45:36.509
Lot of money.

00:45:36.509 --> 00:45:39.991
"No but we've saved this for You, we saved
for You.

00:45:39.991 --> 00:45:42.069
I said: "But you never knew".

00:45:42.069 --> 00:45:51.779
When I was going for this another seminar,
this Yoga seminar My husband said: "What's

00:45:51.779 --> 00:45:53.150
the use of going there now?

00:45:53.150 --> 00:45:54.690
You've been there eight days now.

00:45:54.690 --> 00:45:55.690
Again for the seminar?

00:45:55.690 --> 00:45:56.730
Anybody can look after".

00:45:56.730 --> 00:45:58.080
I said: "I have to go."

00:45:58.080 --> 00:45:59.210
He said: "Why?"

00:45:59.210 --> 00:46:00.450
"To break the Eastern Block."

00:46:00.450 --> 00:46:02.099
He said: "How will You break?"

00:46:02.099 --> 00:46:06.099
I said: "There will be all of them there in
the seminar."

00:46:06.099 --> 00:46:07.780
Really it happened.

00:46:07.780 --> 00:46:08.940
They gave Me only forty-five minutes.

00:46:08.940 --> 00:46:13.480
I spoke for thirty minutes and for fifteen
minutes I gave them Realization.

00:46:13.480 --> 00:46:20.010
See, and in that fifteen minutes all of these
were from all East Germany, from Czechoslovakia,

00:46:20.010 --> 00:46:22.220
Poland; everybody was there.

00:46:22.220 --> 00:46:27.450
All of them walked with Me out; there was
nobody left in the hall for any other lectures,

00:46:27.450 --> 00:46:28.690
and they gave Me their addresses.

00:46:28.690 --> 00:46:35.750
"You must come to Poland, You must come to
this, You must come to East Germany."

00:46:35.750 --> 00:46:40.140
And just after that this triggering took place
and they all started.

00:46:40.140 --> 00:46:44.040
But they must be very powerful means, that's
the point you must remember.

00:46:44.040 --> 00:46:52.779
From every country there could be ten or fifteen
people who could have attended this.

00:46:52.779 --> 00:46:58.690
All together there were only three hundred
delegates.

00:46:58.690 --> 00:46:59.690
And in Romania also [spacing] I found people
were very spiritual, and I said: "Romania

00:46:59.690 --> 00:47:00.690
will be all right.

00:47:00.690 --> 00:47:01.690
Don't you worry."

00:47:01.690 --> 00:47:03.079
It has happened there also.

00:47:03.079 --> 00:47:06.839
They have broken the whole shackles.

00:47:06.839 --> 00:47:14.450
Then came- before that was the Hungary, you
see; they said: "What about Hungary, Mother?"

00:47:14.450 --> 00:47:18.519
I said: "Let there be one Sahaja Yogi from
Hungary."

00:47:18.519 --> 00:47:21.410
And there was one; he was quite sick though.

00:47:21.410 --> 00:47:24.349
Hungary became free.

00:47:24.349 --> 00:47:28.359
So you are the channels, you are the ones
who are going to work it out.

00:47:28.359 --> 00:47:32.950
If it was not so you think I would have asked
you to do all these things?

00:47:32.950 --> 00:47:34.099
I would have done it Myself.

00:47:34.099 --> 00:47:35.099
I can't.

00:47:35.099 --> 00:47:40.749
It is you have to do and you must understand
your responsibilities.

00:47:40.749 --> 00:47:47.970
You should not go into the same mundane nonsensical
ideas but come forward with it and work it

00:47:47.970 --> 00:47:48.970
out.

00:47:48.970 --> 00:47:54.869
You can break all these shackles completely,
if you have that power within you.

00:47:54.869 --> 00:48:01.109
But if you, who are the one who are the one
who are going to transmit this, are not equipped

00:48:01.109 --> 00:48:03.410
and are not strong enough what will I do?

00:48:03.410 --> 00:48:06.609
How can I emit?

00:48:06.609 --> 00:48:15.200
Still we are going in that small circle of:
"Me, my family, my children, my, my, my, my".

00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:17.299
So it's very important.

00:48:17.299 --> 00:48:23.710
I'm sorry I didn't come earlier; I should
have come.

00:48:23.710 --> 00:48:26.920
There's nothing wrong with you that I didn't
come.

00:48:26.920 --> 00:48:32.460
But I wanted to see how you grow, and I think
this is not the way we are going to grow at

00:48:32.460 --> 00:48:35.250
all; we are not going to get separated.

00:48:35.250 --> 00:48:38.829
We are going to live together.

00:48:38.829 --> 00:48:41.010
If you have any problems let Me know.

00:48:41.010 --> 00:48:45.130
But you should immediately try to find out
some place- big one, immediately.

00:48:45.130 --> 00:48:46.970
We all can contribute.

00:48:46.970 --> 00:48:52.369
From all over the world people will contribute;
I know that.

00:48:52.369 --> 00:48:57.680
Same thing in England, you know; England is
another mess.

00:48:57.680 --> 00:49:01.470
We got so much money for Shudy Camps, and
in the Shudy Camps who lives are people who

00:49:01.470 --> 00:49:05.980
have no money, paying nothing.

00:49:05.980 --> 00:49:11.599
Like Hounslow house nobody paid anything,
living free.

00:49:11.599 --> 00:49:16.490
English are the worst in this, the worst of
all, I should say; and I don't know how they

00:49:16.490 --> 00:49:17.490
are going to come up now; everybody has given
up.

00:49:17.490 --> 00:49:23.769
The leaders say: "Mother no use making any
house, anything for them; they'll all come

00:49:23.769 --> 00:49:27.000
with their bag and baggage and we'll have
to pay for even their food".

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:36.650
But now we are getting some better-educated
people, some professionals and things, but

00:49:36.650 --> 00:49:43.619
still I would say that England this Shudy
Camps has failed completely.

00:49:43.619 --> 00:49:46.069
We wanted about seven doctors to see to this.

00:49:46.069 --> 00:49:49.720
We had made everything arrangements beautifully
done, worked very hard for it.

00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:55.960
I put in such a lot of money in there; effort,
planning ; everything has all failed.

00:49:55.960 --> 00:50:02.880
Is just haunted by some people who have no
place to go to.

00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:05.700
This is another kind.

00:50:05.700 --> 00:50:08.509
What's the use of their collectivity there?

00:50:08.509 --> 00:50:14.369
Except that it's a pressure on us in every
way.

00:50:14.369 --> 00:50:17.289
Now you have to show them.

00:50:17.289 --> 00:50:22.040
You were running very good ashrams, no doubt.

00:50:22.040 --> 00:50:32.599
There were no such problems, no such things
happening, and then something went wrong here;

00:50:32.599 --> 00:50:35.529
I know that also.

00:50:35.529 --> 00:50:40.150
Because of that we should not give up our
unity.

00:50:40.150 --> 00:50:45.859
Has happened something; doesn't matter; we
should reunite.

00:50:45.859 --> 00:50:53.230
Unless and until we are united we cannot fight.

00:50:53.230 --> 00:50:58.930
And the negativity is at your door that can
enter through even Sahaja Yogis.

00:50:58.930 --> 00:51:03.980
As it had through your leaders also; I know
that.

00:51:03.980 --> 00:51:07.960
But nobody told Me about it, surprisingly.

00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:14.869
I've already said that you don't tell Me against
the leaders but you tell Me if they are doing

00:51:14.869 --> 00:51:17.450
something wrong; is absolutely allowed.

00:51:17.450 --> 00:51:25.220
Nobody wrote to Me a word till I Myself discovered
it.

00:51:25.220 --> 00:51:32.549
Otherwise from Australia I get at least sometimes
minimum of ten to twenty pages letters.

00:51:32.549 --> 00:51:39.170
But not a word about what was happening here
or how people were dominating you and how

00:51:39.170 --> 00:51:41.339
things were going worse.

00:51:41.339 --> 00:51:42.820
I had to discover it.

00:51:42.820 --> 00:51:46.380
We are all one family, after all I'm your
Mother.

00:51:46.380 --> 00:51:51.480
If you don't tell Me, who is going to tell
Me about it?

00:51:51.480 --> 00:51:52.730
You have every right to tell Me.

00:51:52.730 --> 00:51:57.380
Leaders is just a myth as such.

00:51:57.380 --> 00:51:59.440
That's the way I can communicate.

00:51:59.440 --> 00:52:05.180
But if you find anything wrong with any leader,
or anything, you should tell Me.

00:52:05.180 --> 00:52:12.010
I'm always available, you can always telephone
to Me, I can always talk to you.

00:52:12.010 --> 00:52:16.200
How many people have talked to?

00:52:16.200 --> 00:52:18.359
I never say: "no" if I'm there.

00:52:18.359 --> 00:52:24.160
Any Sahaja Yogi is trying to telephone to
Me, if I am in England or if I'm available,

00:52:24.160 --> 00:52:26.079
I'll talk to that person.

00:52:26.079 --> 00:52:32.769
Or if there is David Spiro he can convey to
Me, he'll communicate to Me exactly what you

00:52:32.769 --> 00:52:34.680
tell.

00:52:34.680 --> 00:52:36.190
So nobody told Me.

00:52:36.190 --> 00:52:38.000
I never knew what was happening.

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:52.109
You'll be amazed I even did not know that
the school was removed 

00:52:52.109 --> 00:52:58.289
to Sydney.

00:52:58.289 --> 00:54:46.849
I did not know; nobody asked Me, nobody told
Me; I had no idea.

00:54:46.849 --> 00:54:57.530
I never knew.

00:54:57.530 --> 00:55:15.549
Suddenly the photographs of 

00:55:15.549 --> 00:55:38.739
the children came and their eyes, you see:
"What's the matter?

00:55:38.739 --> 00:55:44.569
Where are they?"

00:55:44.569 --> 00:56:39.670
Then they told us the school has been removed
and all that, and the children were not normal

00:56:39.670 --> 00:56:46.940
at all.

00:56:46.940 --> 00:57:03.619
I was so shocked.

00:57:03.619 --> 00:57:40.499
Then I found out that the school was removed
without My knowledge, without telling Me.

00:57:40.499 --> 00:57:48.190
So arbitrary and everything.

00:57:48.190 --> 00:57:53.180
Nobody told Me.

00:57:53.180 --> 00:58:04.309
You have to tell Me, you have to inform Me.

00:58:04.309 --> 00:58:36.170
Now, in My lifetime, if this is the situation,
I don't know what's going to happen later.

00:58:36.170 --> 00:59:10.729
Will it be 

00:59:10.729 --> 01:00:55.609
like other Christianity of Paul or another
Hinduism or another thing like that; after

01:00:55.609 --> 01:01:58.140
all 
you 

01:01:58.140 --> 01:02:22.059
are Sahaja Yogis.

01:02:22.059 --> 01:03:15.710
And then you forget your responsibilities
because if you are together you remember your

01:03:15.710 --> 01:03:49.430
responsibilities that 

01:03:49.430 --> 01:05:47.359
you are carrying a big load, a cross you can
call it,a big load.

01:05:47.359 --> 01:07:16.319
Suddenly you remove your hand: "Get out.

01:07:16.319 --> 01:07:41.130
I have nothing to do.

01:07:41.130 --> 01:08:02.849
I'm alone, I'm separate".

01:08:02.849 --> 01:09:21.370
Who is going 

01:09:21.370 --> 01:15:30.050
to carry this 

01:15:30.050 --> 01:16:28.270
big load?
