00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:09.172
Be honest with yourself.

00:00:09.344 --> 00:00:14.400
You have no business to cheat yourself, or anything whatsoever.

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:17.160
If you are hypnotized

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.000
awaken yourself.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:23.760
arise and find what is the best, absolute

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:28.999
and the only thing that you have to find, your Spirit.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.560
Your Spirit resides in the heart.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.760
It is the reflection of God Almighty.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.360
It enjoys itself, by itself.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.999
It is the spectator of the world, of its power,

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:52.880
The Holy Ghost.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.000
It watches you

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.999
and is called as the knower of the fate.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.999
It knows what you are doing,

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.680
what are your aspirations,

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.440
what mistakes you are committing.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.360
It goes to a long extent

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.520
to forgive and forgive and forgive.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.360
Forgiveness is one of the qualities of the Spirit.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.360
It forgives you

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.999
and says it will work out.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.400
It will come around.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.640
But when you go too far,

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.120
say if you pay too much attention to your physical being

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.520
or to your mental being,

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.999
if you try to think too much,

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.999
the Spirit indicates its displeasure

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.680
and you get a heart attack.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.800
Heart attack comes to you through displeasure of the Spirit.

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.160
If the Spirit is angry with you, you get a heart attack.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.999
That means you've neglected your Spirit,

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:14.880
you've paid attention to things which are not important.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.960
You have looked after things which are not important.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.120
You have not worried about yourself, about the Spirit, about your seeking.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.760
Even if you're lost, say in any fanatic behavior

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.120
of reading some books and things and

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.240
taking out certain things and remembering them by heart and

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.999
having an argument and goes on later all that,

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.160
in all genuineness and goodness

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.040
but stupidity then also you can get heart attack.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.680
Heart is very important.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.960
It sometimes gives you first warning

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.999
by giving you a partial paralysis

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.520
because in the heart is sort of a,

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.999
resentment is created by the Spirit which creates a clot,

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.400
a clot, and that clot when goes into the brain

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.840
you get a partial paralysis,

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.360
so that you do not move any further.

00:03:15.999 --> 00:03:17.999
Your attention is taken to it.

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.480
Then you start thinking of God, thinking of all the things

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:28.720
and maybe, if you come to Sahaja yoga you get cured

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.999
because again your Spirit forgives you.

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.999
We are taking too much liberty with our Spirit.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.080
It is true God has given you freedom

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.960
and He is not going to take away your freedom at any cost.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.760
You have to be absolutely free to choose

00:03:50.999 --> 00:03:53.440
whether to go to heaven or to go to hell.

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.680
He is not going to force you.

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.040
Only thing one can do is to explain to you

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.120
and tell you that this is the way you go to hell.

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.360
Even then if you want to go

00:04:07.999 --> 00:04:11.440
then what can anybody do about it?

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.320
Even God, He doesn't want to challenge your freedom at all.

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.120
He doesn't want to make you, in any way

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.320
bound to Him, like some people are,

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.400
bound just bound, without understanding.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.520
But He wants your complete liberation.

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.999
So the first stage is that you have to choose your liberation

00:04:30.999 --> 00:04:33.640
through your own freedom of choice.

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.880
Now, up to this point, till you were human beings,

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.160
there was no choice for you,

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.999
but after becoming a human being

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.960
you were given the choice because you could develop well

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.999
to understand what is right and wrong in your own freedom,

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:57.520
so that you can enter into the Kingdom of God as people

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:02.720
who are free and have chosen good in their own glory

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.960
and in their own freedom.

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.560
This is the only small little step

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:16.200
where we always confuse our freedom with our ego.

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:21.080
For example, now,

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.080
this hall is here say, for me to speak.

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:31.280
Somebody comes from outside who has been sort of

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:34.200
worked up in some sort of an organization and

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.600
he thinks he is doing the greatest work in the whole world in such a myth.

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.200
Comes down here in that ego state,

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.360
sits down here and asks me

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.240
questions after questions, questions after questions, questions after questions,

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:49.999
doesn't allow anybody else to speak,

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.480
takes away all my time to himself

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:57.360
as if this hall is booked by him and all the audience is gathered by him.

00:05:57.999 --> 00:06:00.520
He is least bother as to see

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.800
that this is an ego that is working.

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:10.920
So we should not confuse our freedom with ego,

00:06:10.999 --> 00:06:13.840
that's what I have to give you a counsel.

00:06:13.999 --> 00:06:20.200
Try to differentiate your ego from your freedom.

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:24.320
When you are ego bound, you are a slave of your ego.

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:28.280
When you are super ego bound, you are slave

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:31.000
of your super ego, of your conditioning.

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:34.000
For example, you are born a Christian, you are a Christian

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:35.999
you are bound forever then.

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:39.880
All right, you are a Christian but what about real Christianity within you.

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:43.120
What about your rebirth in the real sense of the word.

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:50.040
So you become enslaved to these things, so there is no freedom.

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:55.040
And Spirit is the freedom, is the free

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:57.920
being within us.

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:02.080
It is detached. It cannot be killed.

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:07.000
It cannot be blown away. It cannot be burnt away.

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:11.800
It is eternal. Anant. It is eternal.

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:17.040
That Spirit is joy.

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.999
That Spirit is the source of joy,

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:24.040
that emits joy.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.960
Joy is different from happiness and unhappiness.

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:33.999
Ego, when it feels pampered, it feels happy.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.920
I like it, I like it.

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:39.280
This "I" business

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:43.120
is ego pampering,

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:46.999
that is no joy. Because you like to drink today

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.720
and tomorrow you don't like to have a headache.

00:07:50.999 --> 00:07:54.480
It has the double side of I like and I don't like.

00:07:55.999 --> 00:08:02.280
You like something through your ego, dislike through your super ego.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.800
So it is a one coin

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:10.480
and there are two faces, one is happiness and another is unhappiness.

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:14.999
Joy is beyond that. Joy is a drama,

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:20.680
seer, is a witness. You see a drama. You know it's a drama going on.

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:24.000
You just watch it as a drama. You're not involved

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:26.480
and you are seeing it and enjoying it.

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:28.680
You are crying if you see something, you're

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:31.600
weeping but you know you are not that, it's a drama.

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:33.840
Seer, the witness.

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:37.600
Your Spirit is the witness

00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:42.080
and when you become the Spirit, you become the witness.

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:46.440
You become the witness. For example,

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:50.560
you are seeing something through a window.

00:08:50.999 --> 00:08:54.160
There is something exists in the window for example.

00:08:55.080 --> 00:09:00.480
Now you enter inside the room and you see through the window.

00:09:01.999 --> 00:09:06.400
Your conditioning is like one way arising in you as a thought,

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:08.240
which comes from the past.

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:14.400
It rises again and another thought comes up and goes in the past.

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:16.999
First the past thought is there and

00:09:16.999 --> 00:09:19.920
then another future thought is there it disappears.

00:09:19.999 --> 00:09:23.800
You see the thought rising but you can't see a disappearing of the thought.

00:09:23.999 --> 00:09:26.000
In between that is the present.

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:29.520
That's the place is established, that present

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:34.999
is established when your attention becomes enlightened by the Spirit.

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:38.360
Either you think of the future or of the past.

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:42.600
But I say now, at this moment, at the present.

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:49.080
You cannot stand there because your Spirit is not enlightened.

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:51.800
Because Spirit is the present.

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:56.920
When you get your Realization,

00:09:56.999 --> 00:10:00.440
you find that you are not thinking

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:03.240
of the future or the past, you are just enjoying.

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:05.600
Everything becomes different.

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:09.999
The whole life becomes a drama

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:12.680
and the joy out of it starts coming out

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:16.400
and you really enjoy small, small things here and there

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:19.200
and you really understand

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:22.360
how much joy was lost before Realization.

00:10:22.999 --> 00:10:26.000
This is not a mental thing that gives you joy

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:29.480
but the joy pours on you from your head just like this,

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:32.480
cool thing starts pouring down.

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:36.800
As some people have a feeling of a tension rising up,

00:10:36.999 --> 00:10:40.760
it's the same way, a cool sort of thing,

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:46.560
flow of joy you feel in your whole body pours out.

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:49.999
Sometimes this cool breeze that rises in the head

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:54.680
also starts becoming like a fountain pouring down that joy within you.

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:59.120
You look at the pictures, are examples see this star of Moses.

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:01.600
You see, David star, you see that

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:05.800
when you see than you can think about it

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
or else just watch this.

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:10.360
Watch it and don't think.

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:17.040
The joy of the creation of that thing, whole thing, becomes one with you.

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:22.999
Like all the creation around a lake

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:28.440
is completely felt in the lake

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:30.520
if the lake has no ripples.

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:35.200
Completely. In the same way, all that is joy,

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:38.999
the creator, whosoever it may be has put there.

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:43.520
You get the complete joy within yourself because there is no thought.

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:46.440
There is no barrier. No conditioning.

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:49.040
The whole thing becomes one with you

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:51.640
and you start feeling extremely happy.

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:54.560
Extremely joyous.

00:11:56.640 --> 00:12:01.120
A feeling, which is indescribable.

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:06.680
It is to be just enjoyed, to be felt. Like Kabira was asked,

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:10.240
"Why don't you speak now?" So he says in Hindi language,

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:12.320
he is one of the terrific poets we have,

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:15.160
he says, "Jab mast huye to kya huye.

00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:24.280
When I have gone into the nectar of the intoxication

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:27.120
of the Spirit, now what can I talk.

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:30.960
There no word. No cup can fill this joy,

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.640
no words can fill this meaning.

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:36.999
You better be with me and get it and enjoy yourself."

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:38.999
That's all he could say.
