00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:19.860
I bow to all the seekers of truth. It gives
me immense pleasure to come to Cardiff again

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:30.530
for this programme of Sahaja Yoga. They must
have explained to you what is Sahaja Yoga.

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:38.690
That is, ‘Saha’ is ‘with’ and ‘Ja’
is ‘born’–it is born with you and all

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:46.940
of us have a birth right to get this spontaneous
yoga, that is the union with the Divine. Ascent

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:55.630
to the Divine is our birth right. Only thing
we must reach that state of awareness where

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:10.569
we become aware of higher seeking within us.
First as a human being we seek food, then

00:01:10.569 --> 00:01:20.380
protection, house, possessions, money, power-and
then we find that all these things even if

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:28.770
you have achieved you have not been able to
achieve what you wanted-that is the state

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:38.490
of joy, and thus you start seeking furthermore
to find out what should be that state in which

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.139
you remain in complete joy.

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:51.209
Many people have no idea as to what to expect
and also they are quite naive about the structure

00:01:51.209 --> 00:02:00.409
or the nature of this tree of life which is
built within us. Now what I’m going to tell

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:09.789
you is the Knowledge of the Roots. So far
with our developments we only know the Knowledge

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:17.890
of the Tree, but we have to know the Knowledge
of the Roots which sustains this tree. If

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:24.360
we do not know that Knowledge, it may be one
day this great tree that we see which seems

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:32.410
to be quite secure, may completely be destroyed.
So it is important for everyone to have that

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:40.760
Knowledge of the Roots within ourselves and
within our society, within human beings as

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:41.670
a whole.

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:48.570
Now we have to realise that we have come to
this state of human awareness up to a point

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:56.750
where we find we are lost. These days in the
modern times, we are very much confused because

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:03.050
there are so many ideas afloat. All these
ideas confuse us and we don’t know where

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:09.160
to look, what to see, the value systems have
changed rapidly so drastically that it is

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:15.810
difficult for us to keep up and cope with
it. Despite all that, it seems that there

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:25.010
must be some hope for us: after all God, God
who has created this Universe must be worried

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:31.130
about this creation. After all, He has to
do something about it. It’s no use only

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:38.850
our worrying about it, or being aware of the
shocks, the future shocks that we may receive

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:50.610
because of the mistakes we have committed
before. It is He who has made us and it is

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:57.660
He who works out everything for us. For example,
we believe that we do this and we do that.

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:07.380
What we do is the work of the dead to the
dead. We do not do any living work. We cannot

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:16.180
transform one flower into a fruit. But you
see in different seasons we find different

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:23.020
types of flowers, different types of fruits
coming in, we find every child that is born

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:29.210
has something to do with the society, with
the parents, with the country where it is

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:37.529
born, it is such a big selection that it is
impossible to find out who could have done

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:47.289
it with such tremendous powers of accuracy.
A child is conceived in a Mother’s womb,

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:52.699
is a very big miracle itself to all the medical
science because normally everything that is

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:59.580
foreign is thrown out of the body–but when
the foetus is formed in the body, it is not

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:05.960
thrown out, on the contrary it is preserved,
looked after, nourished and thrown out at

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:12.330
the time when it is fully matured. This is
such a remarkable thing that we see everyday,

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.990
but somehow or other we take everything for
granted.

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:21.689
Human beings if they look at themselves, they’ll
be amazed how beautifully we are made. This

00:05:21.689 --> 00:05:29.199
is something special about us. We know so
many things more than the animals do. An animal

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:36.360
can pass through a dirty lane, he cannot understand
any architecture, he cannot understand any

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:45.039
colours, any beauty, but we human beings have
so many ideas and also abstract ideas. But

00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:53.659
beyond this is a state where you reach into
an absolute state-so far still we live in

00:05:53.659 --> 00:06:00.279
a relative world. Whatever we know is so relative
that it is difficult to decide really what

00:06:00.279 --> 00:06:06.529
is right and what is wrong. Relatively we
can say alright, this is little right and

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:12.789
this is little wrong. But we cannot absolutely
say that this is right and this is wrong.

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:20.879
Here then we start thinking-ate we really
fully evolved? We are not. We are not evolved.

00:06:20.879 --> 00:06:27.469
And when I say this you should take it as
an hypothesis with a very open mind of a scientist.

00:06:27.469 --> 00:06:33.029
And then if it is proved you have to accept
it as a law, not before that.

00:06:33.029 --> 00:06:42.289
It is very hard to believe that we can become
the Spirit. This is one of the big myths of

00:06:42.289 --> 00:06:49.729
modern times and many a times when I speak
about becoming the Spirit people say that

00:06:49.729 --> 00:06:58.199
-how can you say like that, how can it be
that easy-but it is a living process of our

00:06:58.199 --> 00:07:05.129
evolution and if it is done by the power.
of a living God, then it has to be very simple,

00:07:05.129 --> 00:07:12.499
has to be very easy-like if you have to sprout
a seed You just Put it in the Mother Earth,

00:07:12.499 --> 00:07:17.279
and the seed has a capacity to become the
plant and the Mother Earth has a capacity

00:07:17.279 --> 00:07:24.490
to sprout it. In the same way, this happening
has to take place. Today that time has come.

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:31.770
That time has come, the time of judgement
has come and at this time we have to see that

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:38.080
we’ll be judging ourselves, but not by some
sort of a weight or some sort of an authority,

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:43.270
but by something which is within us which
we call as the Kundalini:, is placed in the

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:49.289
triangular bone called as sacrum. Just see,
Greeks knew about it, that’s why they called

00:07:49.289 --> 00:07:55.419
this bone as sacrum. But what is this bone
in the biblical understanding-it is the reflection

00:07:55.419 --> 00:08:02.009
of the Holy Ghost. We have to understand that
if there is a Father God and a Son-there has

00:08:02.009 --> 00:08:07.909
to be a Mother. So this is the primordial
Mother who is the Holy Ghost and She is reflected

00:08:07.909 --> 00:08:17.089
within us as the Kundalini. In our heart is
reflected the God Almighty. It is He who is

00:08:17.089 --> 00:08:23.779
the witness of whatever we are doing. This
power manifests everything within us and then

00:08:23.779 --> 00:08:31.580
resides in a sleeping state in that triangular
bone and is said to be residual because it

00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:40.100
has not yet manifested itself. This is the
power of our desire which is true and the

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:47.790
only desire we have which is pure. Because
all other desires are not true. If they were

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:52.890
true, any one of them when satisfied, we would
not have desired for anything else. But it

00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:58.580
is not so as you know in economics that wants
in general are not satiable. So you want to

00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:07.820
have something today, then we want to have
another thing tomorrow. But once the desire

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:13.390
of becoming one with the Divine manifests
then you don’t want anything-you want to

00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:22.930
give. Like you want to be the light and then
you become the light that emits light and

00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:30.230
emancipates others -raises them to the level
of their Spirit by giving them peace and bliss.

00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:35.180
Today we talk of peace. But how can we have
peace with the people who are so disturbed.

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:40.560
We have to have transformation of human beings,
who should feel peaceful within themselves

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:46.270
and should feel that they are the ones who
are part and parcel of the whole. But this

00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:51.350
should not be a conception or a mental projection.
Because mental projection can disappear in

00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:57.490
no time. Like you would believe that this
particular person is my friend but you discover

00:09:57.490 --> 00:10:00.570
that he is not and the whole mental projection
drops out.

00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:05.370
So all mental projections are artificial,
they last for a short time and disappear.

00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:10.860
But this is a happening that has to take place
within us when we become the Spirit. It is

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:18.060
the question of you feeling that Spirit on
your central nervous system. So in our evolutionary

00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:25.300
process whatever happened to us has happened
to our central nervous system, and that is

00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:30.180
what Christ has exactly said when he said
you are to be born again. He didn’t say

00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:34.680
that you just ask somebody to do an exercise
of putting some water on top of your head

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:40.480
and then say now you are baptised. No. There
is a true baptism of the real awakening of

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:45.520
this Kundalini passing through these six centres
above, piercing through your fontanel bone

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:51.040
area and giving you the true experience of
the breeze of the Holy Ghost coming out of

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:58.950
your own head and this cannot be by just putting
water by somebody. It has to happen within

00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:04.080
yourself and you have to seek the truth, and
not something that just satisfies you for

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:04.800
the time being.

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:09.790
That’s why even if you profess any religion
we find we don’t have much transformation

00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:17.090
within. But here you become the Spirit, the
fight of the Spirit we can say, on our central

00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:22.910
nervous system just guides you. Like first
of all when this Kundalini rises She passes

00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:29.160
through these centres on the physical level
and you get physical health. Some people say,

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:33.730
Mother, you heal us or cure us-is not true.
It is your own Kundalini. It’s your own

00:11:33.730 --> 00:11:34.930
Mother within you.

00:11:34.930 --> 00:11:43.880
Everybody has an individual Mother, when She
rises, She actually fulfils the need of every

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:51.840
subtle centre that supplies to your gross
centres, because these are the abstract or

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:57.330
we can say are the subtle centres which are
first fulfilled and they look after your plexuses,

00:11:57.330 --> 00:12:03.350
that’s how you get heated automatically.
It is you who heal yourself, not me. I’m

00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:08.600
just a catalyst you can say, like one enlightened
light can enlighten another one , and once

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:14.380
you are enlightened, you can enlighten another
person. That is how it is. So there is no

00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:20.340
obligation. There is no give and take. It’s
like we are part and parcel of the whole.

00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:27.350
Now we have, say, a problem on a finger. What
do we do? We just rub that finger and find

00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:34.180
that we feel better. But have we any way obliged
this finger? Because it is part and parcel

00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:40.500
of you it just spontaneously has happened
and has worked out. In the same way it happens

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:44.760
to you also that you get this Realisation
automatically.

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:51.310
Now the mass evolution has started and there
are many who have got Realisation like that.

00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:58.000
I’m happy to know in England also we have
at least two to three thousand people who

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:05.040
are realised very well, who are established,
but there may be much more who have got Realisation,

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:10.130
but then you have to establish yourself like
a tree. Once you establish like a tree you

00:13:10.130 --> 00:13:15.010
can give Realisation to others and you can
give them peace and the whole thing is such

00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:19.660
a transformed personality-because the second
thing that happens to you when you become

00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:26.570
the Spirit that you become so powerful that
nothing dominates you. Nothing dominates you.

00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:32.740
There is no habit that can dominate you. No
temptation can dominate you and you become

00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:38.360
very powerful, But at the same time you are
extremely compassionate, you are extremely

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:43.880
kind, so it is a very compassionate power
that you develop of the Spirit and you become

00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:50.300
a new personality, a wonderful personality.
We know when we have Christmas, when we have

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:57.360
Easter, we give eggs to people. This denotes
the Resurrection of Christ as our own Resurrection,

00:13:57.360 --> 00:14:05.010
that an egg has to become the bird. It is
symbolic of that. That we are like eggs when

00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:10.770
we are closed, when we have this ‘I ness
within us, and then suddenly when this happens

00:14:10.770 --> 00:14:17.840
to us, this egg becomes the bird and you become
completely free and you know what freedom

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:27.700
is. Freedom is no licence but freedom which
, is absolutely not curbing anybody’s freedom

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:35.100
nor is giving you any bondages. It is something
so great it should happen to all of us.

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:41.560
We have had many great saints in this country,
I would like to mention William Blake who

00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:47.690
was a great saint and who saw all this happening
Ion ‘time back, two hundred years back-and

00:14:47.690 --> 00:14:55.740
He wrote about it that such and such time
will come when men of God will become prophets

00:14:55.740 --> 00:15:01.170
and these prophets will have powers to make
others prophets. He has said so many things

00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:09.340
that time has come today for England to rise
as He has desired and described. That time

00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:15.930
is here today now at this time you should
get your Realisation-you’ll realise that

00:15:15.930 --> 00:15:22.500
now you have entered into that Kingdom of
God. We have also many people, we can say

00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:28.280
even Mohammed Sahib has said that “At the
time of Resurrection your hands will speak.”

00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:33.460
Exactly this happens, that when you get your
Realisation, when the Kundalini comes up,

00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:41.550
and She touches the seat of God here immediately
in your heart the reflection of God starts

00:15:41.550 --> 00:15:49.900
emitting cool vibrations from your hands also.
When it starts happening you are amazed that

00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:56.560
all around you feel the subtle power. of God,
the power of His love, what we call the all-pervading

00:15:56.560 --> 00:16:02.750
Brahma, what we call the Chaitanya, that’s
how you start feeling it and once you start

00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:09.830
feeling it you are amazed that how you can
find about anything. You become like a computer.

00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:15.490
As soon as you want to find out whether it
is right or wrong, say you want to ask a question,”

00:16:15.490 --> 00:16:20.080
Is there God?”-Immediately you’ll find
there will be cool breeze coming out. But

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:25.200
if You want to find about Hitler, you might
get a blister or a heat on your hands and

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:30.600
you’ll feel horrible about it. So that is
how you start working it out and gradually

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:36.990
you become absolutely wise in the sense you
become absolute and you understand.

00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:41.590
Just now if you look at a person how will
you find out who is right and who is wrong?

00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:47.279
But when this happens to you, you don’t
have to know about him. On his centres you

00:16:47.279 --> 00:16:52.610
know because you become collectively conscious.
You become, again I say, it is a becoming,

00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:57.460
You become collectively conscious, you can
know about your own centres and you can know

00:16:57.460 --> 00:17:02.730
about the centres of others. And when you
feel the centres of others, you know what

00:17:02.730 --> 00:17:07.770
the problem is, you don’t talk like other
people talk, but you talk in the language

00:17:07.770 --> 00:17:12.530
of centres. This is exactly what happened
to the disciples of Christ when they were

00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:17.370
blessed by the Holy Ghost, the cool breeze
came on them, they started speaking in strange

00:17:17.370 --> 00:17:22.370
languages. And the same thing you’ll find
with Sahaja Yogis that they speak in a strange

00:17:22.370 --> 00:17:27.660
language in the sense that they talk in the
language of the centres, and they start using

00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:32.190
their hands in a way because the hand has
got the power flowing, and they use it to

00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:36.930
bind it up and that looks very strange and
at that time also it looked very strange so

00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:42.160
people started saying that they are mad people,
they are doing some sort of funny actions.

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:48.630
So all this happens, it’s very simple, has
to happen, the time has come, it is the blossom

00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:57.860
time; at that time I would say, in the early
days, it was not the blossom time but it was

00:17:57.860 --> 00:18:02.870
the time when there were hardly one or two
flowers on the tree of life, but today is

00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:09.380
different-there are so many seekers all over
the world though misled by all kinds of things,

00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:16.800
because as soon as they come to know, the
negatives, that God has decided to work it

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:21.740
out, they have come in the market and they
are selling their goods. One must know that

00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:28.620
you cannot sell God in the market. Secondly
you cannot organise God. But we are so much

00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:33.680
used to it, paying for everything that we
can’t understand that we can get something

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:35.309
without paying.

00:18:35.309 --> 00:18:42.809
But think of a seed which we sow in the Mother
Earth. What do we do? Do we pay anything?

00:18:42.809 --> 00:18:48.300
Does it understand money? Do living processes
understand money? Do you think God understands

00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:56.820
money? You can’t pay for it. If you put
this one small little test,-99 per cent of

00:18:56.820 --> 00:19:01.809
these bogus people will disappear from the
scene. But we don’t think, we don’t use

00:19:01.809 --> 00:19:06.740
our brains, we go headlong into it. On the
contrary they will ask thousands of questions

00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:11.610
to me but to these people who have taken thousands
of pounds and have finished them off they

00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:16.840
don’t ask any question. They just go headlong
into it, ruin their lives, get into epilepsies

00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:21.840
and all kinds of diseases, then they come
to me and I find that they are in a very bad

00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:25.780
shape. But doesn’t matter, whatever has
happened has happened. Nobody should feel

00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:31.010
guilty about it. That’s one condition of
Sahaja Yoga is that we should not feel guilty.

00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:32.750
We have to be in the present.

00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:37.330
Forget the past. We are not to think about
the past. And at this present moment this

00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:39.570
should happen to all of us.

00:19:39.570 --> 00:19:44.420
Now the subject matter is so great and the
knowledge is like an ocean, I cannot in this

00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:49.510
short time tell you all about it, I would
say there must be at least two thousand lectures

00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:56.390
in English language which I have given all
over the places, and I would request you first

00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:58.400
of all to get the light within you.

00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:05.550
Like this room when it is not lighted and
if I tell you about this room it will be a

00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:10.750
headache, and if I tell you about the electricity,
the history of the electricity, the connections

00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:15.309
of electricity, the sources of electricity,
you’ll be fed up. First of all, let us have

00:20:15.309 --> 00:20:19.440
the light. Once we have the fight it’s much
easier to understand, and you’ll have much

00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:25.140
patience. So I would request you first to
have the light We can try it, I cannot guarantee,

00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:31.520
I must say, I cannot guarantee to everyone-is
something that works out but may not work

00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:39.730
out also. As far as possible, we should try
and let us see what happens to us and if it

00:20:39.730 --> 00:20:49.330
works out that would be really a very great pleasure for me. May God bless you all.
