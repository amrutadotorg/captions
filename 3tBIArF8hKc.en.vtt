﻿Navaratri Puja, Just Surrender
Hampstead, London (UK), 19 October 1980

00:01.646 --> 00:11.511
So you have already heard about the importance of today
in the life of the Goddess.

00:13.029 --> 00:15.797
And that today is Ravana was killed

00:15.857 --> 00:19.680
and that’s how there were celebrations.

00:24.120 --> 00:27.198
It still reflects itself [unsure]

00:30.416 --> 00:32.584
As you know very well

00:32.933 --> 00:39.159
that all the satanic forces
which one had to face one at the time

00:39.659 --> 00:46.916
are all back on the stage
and they are to be defeated.

00:48.273 --> 00:51.214
The greatest problem of modern times is

00:51.853 --> 00:56.903
that these satanic forces
have taken a very subtle form

00:58.090 --> 01:02.415
and they enter into your psyches and into your egos.

01:03.510 --> 01:07.717
And you are the saints, you are the bhaktas,
you are the devotees of the Goddess.

01:09.376 --> 01:14.999
It’s a very delicate situation
when the confusion is there.

01:15.785 --> 01:25.536
When the saints are attacked,
the aggressor can be removed,

01:25.678 --> 01:34.524
but the saint becomes mixed up
or confused with negative forces,

01:35.239 --> 01:38.791
which is very difficult to make him see the light.

01:40.332 --> 01:43.198
And you have seen this situation very well.

01:44.741 --> 01:47.941
And the subtler you grow, the subtler they became.

01:48.662 --> 01:56.204
And they start giving you ideas
which are so negative,

01:56.428 --> 01:59.027
but you cannot see them.

02:03.012 --> 02:08.403
So the problem today is very delicate.

02:10.768 --> 02:15.802
There are no absolute saints
and there are no absolute bad people.

02:16.129 --> 02:17.879
Such a mixture, a confusion,

02:17.972 --> 02:22.404
that is what is Kali Yuga is,
these modern times are.

02:25.178 --> 02:29.907
The only way to get rid of them is to surrender.

02:32.047 --> 02:35.643
That is the only way,
there is no other way around.

02:37.053 --> 02:39.443
Because when you surrender,

02:39.884 --> 02:46.913
the spirits, the negativities,
the satanic forces just disappear

02:47.367 --> 02:49.542
because they are not effective.

02:52.165 --> 02:54.017
They have no business to be there.

02:54.236 --> 02:59.585
They have no interest in a person
who is surrendered to God.

03:01.039 --> 03:03.265
They cannot surrender.

03:04.829 --> 03:08.165
If they surrender, they’ll also become saints.

03:12.381 --> 03:19.315
All the time to think: “What are my catches?
What are my negativities?” Is not going to help you.

03:20.187 --> 03:22.955
Just surrender all these ideas that are coming to you

03:23.057 --> 03:27.715
and you’ll find that all absurd ideas will run away.

03:28.884 --> 03:34.785
This is the easiest way to get rid of your problems,
is just to surrender.

03:36.185 --> 03:50.907
After all, all these horrible people,
all the horrible deities, enemies,

03:52.101 --> 04:04.493
who came forward to fight the Goddess, are there
as long as you nurture them.

04:05.975 --> 04:10.323
As soon as you surrender yourself,

04:10.661 --> 04:14.375
they find you of no
use for themselves

04:14.523 --> 04:18.113
and they go to other half-baked people.

04:21.815 --> 04:26.047
The growth will only come,
when the surrender is complete.

04:30.451 --> 04:33.984
One has to know that the powers are tremendous.

04:36.822 --> 04:39.438
You cannot conceive it as it is said by Markandeya.

04:39.488 --> 04:43.601
You cannot conceive it;
it is beyond your conception.

04:44.136 --> 04:48.999
Outwardly you cannot understand,
you just cannot understand.

04:52.554 --> 04:56.598
Under such circumstances,
the best thing is to surrender yourself.

04:57.456 --> 04:59.950
Now with surrendering, what do you surrender?

05:00.214 --> 05:05.812
What do you surrender?
It’s your ego and your super-ego

05:06.801 --> 05:12.203
and it is completely cleansed and drenched
in the blessing.

05:13.620 --> 05:15.820
Because you cannot give anything,

05:16.204 --> 05:18.196
you have to receive the blessings

05:18.839 --> 05:22.815
and to receive the blessings
you have to just surrender.

05:23.055 --> 05:24.828
It is so simple.

05:25.211 --> 05:30.733
The easiest way to solve all your problems
is to surrender.

05:34.708 --> 05:39.898
Just say: “I surrender”.
For Realized souls this should be their mantra.

05:40.764 --> 05:44.921
And you will be amazed
how all your problems will vanish.

05:47.093 --> 05:51.004
Because not only that the powers are tremendous,

05:53.564 --> 05:56.113
but as you are Realized souls

05:56.988 --> 06:02.450
all the divine Forces, all the divine Deities,

06:03.417 --> 06:05.817
all the Eternal Beings, Chiranjivas,

06:06.388 --> 06:09.497
all the angels and the ganas,

06:10.086 --> 06:12.309
all of them are looking after you.

06:12.965 --> 06:17.720
But they know one thing, those who are surrendered
and those who are not surrendered.

06:19.333 --> 06:21.519
You just surrender the problem,

06:22.204 --> 06:26.032
and you will be surprised that
the answer will come in such a miraculous way.

06:26.385 --> 06:32.214
Just surrender. Do not take any responsibility
upon yourself. Just surrender.

06:33.645 --> 06:39.003
Because how far you can go into the solution?
Up to your rationality.

06:39.657 --> 06:45.310
Beyond that you are your Spirit,
and the Spirit is connected to the Divine.

06:46.036 --> 06:48.099
So best is to surrender

06:48.871 --> 06:55.696
and the whole thing will show such light
and such beauty and such meaning.

06:57.980 --> 07:03.828
In the modern times now the work is not the same way
as it was where it is described,

07:04.301 --> 07:12.617
when the Raudrarupa or that the Chandrarupa
you see there, was there at the back.

07:15.604 --> 07:22.422
It’s a mine work, it’s a Mother,
it’s a simple, loving, compassionate.

07:22.956 --> 07:31.917
For your protection, this rupa is there,
but you do not see it.

07:33.429 --> 07:36.708
You are completely protected, be sure of it.

07:41.651 --> 07:46.916
And all your powers after Realization
of giving Kundalini awakening,

07:47.041 --> 07:52.599
or of curing people, or of talking about
Sahaja Yoga, or spreading it,

07:52.868 --> 07:58.905
any, any kind of thing that you want
is all granted, is all flowing through.

08:02.584 --> 08:05.186
And as you know, that there are many saints, who have said,

08:05.257 --> 08:12.372
that “Why these Sahaja Yogis,
they should be granted this great boon?”

08:12.725 --> 08:16.493
So one can say it’s a whim, all right.

08:20.231 --> 08:22.213
There is one more thing.

08:23.101 --> 08:29.757
I was happy to learn that the great poet of this country,
Blake, had prophesied about Me.

08:29.973 --> 08:35.308
And it is so beautifully done, that He said that
England is going to be the Jerusalem.

08:35.693 --> 08:37.921
This is going to be the pilgrimage.

08:38.538 --> 08:40.218
The venue has shifted.

08:41.141 --> 08:43.022
And then He has very beautifully-

08:43.087 --> 08:47.797
have you got the thing to read?
Oh, haven’t brought it.

08:48.042 --> 08:51.091
But what reading, that He has said that

08:51.163 --> 08:57.399
first the furnace will be burning in Surrey Hills,
where I came first,

08:57.811 --> 09:01.926
and then He has mentioned Lambeth Vale,
where we have got our Ashram,

09:02.070 --> 09:05.208
where the foundations will be laid,
we have laid the foundations.

09:05.540 --> 09:09.316
And that Jerusalem is going to be in England, not in India.

09:12.167 --> 09:15.623
And you are the people
responsible for this Jerusalem.

09:19.500 --> 09:28.821
Today is the day for which
in India everybody is doing Puja.

09:30.308 --> 09:36.898
And all the Sahaja Yogis today,
in every center there is a Puja today.

09:38.123 --> 09:40.703
And they are all thinking of you people.

09:44.569 --> 09:54.101
So you have to receive the supreme bliss today,
the supreme bliss, only by surrender.

09:54.888 --> 09:57.288
Today the vibrations are tremendous.

09:57.579 --> 10:00.590
Keep all your doubts and all your nonsensical things outside.

10:01.131 --> 10:03.589
Just receive it and get it.

10:04.790 --> 10:07.310
These things are going to help you, nothing else.

10:07.562 --> 10:10.617
Because you don’t have to give Me anything,
but receive it yourself.

10:10.956 --> 10:13.310
Receive it as much as you can.

10:23.218 --> 10:32.398
This Havan you know is a very good thing
for reciting the name of the Goddess.

10:33.119 --> 10:36.410
Her eyes are given by fire, [Agni] as they say,

10:38.003 --> 10:45.310
and in that light, in that fire,
in the name of Goddess,

10:45.591 --> 10:47.600
we awaken our Deities within us

10:48.322 --> 10:57.102
and burn away all that is wrong in these particular chakras
which invoke those powers.

10:58.469 --> 11:01.118
So with devotion and understanding you have to do it.

11:01.198 --> 11:05.304
Because you are really privileged people, today,
extremely privileged.

11:05.942 --> 11:10.709
Be proud of that,
and do with that devotion all these things.

11:12.116 --> 11:14.929
Today is a very much better time

11:15.015 --> 11:21.912
because the Dashara and the Navaratri,
both are combined at this time.

11:22.669 --> 11:24.740
And so it has worked out very well.

11:24.985 --> 11:27.399
We should do it with full devotion.

11:28.047 --> 11:36.897
I think very few people can put in the fire,
but we can all do symbolically and say this.

11:37.142 --> 11:40.419
And how many names do you want to take away?

11:41.520 --> 11:43.614
Hundred-and-eight?

11:43.757 --> 11:44.328
Sahaja Yogi: Thousand.

11:44.401 --> 11:45.584
Shri Mataji: “What’s it?

11:45.660 --> 11:48.212
Shri Mataji: You would like to thousand?
That is a good idea.

11:48.316 --> 11:50.630
If you have that much devotion
it will be the best

11:50.695 --> 11:53.025
because it will about take two hours
at the most, at the most.

11:53.146 --> 11:55.761
Not two hours, I think one hour if we go fast.

11:56.264 --> 11:57.841
Will you be able to say all that?

11:57.915 --> 11:59.213
Do you think it’s easy?”

11:59.475 --> 12:00.995
Sahaja Yogi: “Yes.”

12:01.778 --> 12:03.978
Shri Mataji: “One thousand names.

12:05.214 --> 12:07.321
Or else, you can give food to children.

12:07.512 --> 12:08.956
They will be tired.

12:09.088 --> 12:12.783
What do you think?
Let’s try it.

12:15.771 --> 12:17.592
In India they would do one thousand.

12:17.762 --> 12:23.311
Sahaja Yogi: Then we will do thousand.
