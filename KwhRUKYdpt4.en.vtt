00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:16.280
It's a great thing today that we are celebrating

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:24.560
the Virgin’s worship in England.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.560
As you know, according to Sahaja Yoga,

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:44.040
England is the heart where resides the Spirit of Shiva.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.480
And that Virgin should be respected and revered

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.520
and worshipped in England

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:06.160
is a great honor, I think, for all the Sahaja Yogis.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:26.000
Now one has to think why such an importance is paid to a Virgin?

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:39.480
Why a Virgin is respected to that extent?

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.760
What are the powers of a Virgin?

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.120
That She can bear a child

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:04.360
of that magnitude that was Christ,

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:15.400
that She could create Shri Ganesha out of Her own body,

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:29.560
that She could protect innocent, dynamic force of Her children

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:36.320
who are egoless, who have not known what is ego.

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:57.040
So this great power and force resides

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:11.000
in a person who has lots of 'guru punyas' [guru virtues],

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:16.000
who has done lots of good things in previous lives,

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:30.080
who has always understood

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:38.680
that Virginity is a power higher than any other power and

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:52.800
would save the Virginity and Chastity with all Her effort and care.

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:07.000
As you know that within our body She is placed as Kundalini,

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.800
means She is the Virgin.

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.560
She is untouched,

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:28.160
the desire to become Spirit is without any blemish, "nirmala".

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.040
There is no blemish.

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.480
Its waiting is pure.

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:53.640
There's no other desire but to be one with the Divine.

00:04:54.480 --> 00:05:00.000
All other desires are finished.

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:15.720
It's a very difficult subject for Me to talk about in the Western country.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:22.720
It's embarrassing. I do not want any one of you, whether men or women,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.560
to develop any guilt in your mind.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.000
Because that is one thing is the greatest blemish as you know,

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:42.040
at a later stage this guilt works in the opposite direction.

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.360
It is of no help.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:56.240
But when we understand that we have these problems,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.040
we have to be humble about it. Not guilty but humble.

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:19.520
If you are not humble about it, and aggressive about demanding

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.480
what have you got out of Sahaja Yoga

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:26.000
and complaining about it all the time,

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:34.120
while not seeing what are your own punyas, what do you deserve?

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:43.600
Your Kundalini, despite every blemish, has been raised.

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:49.320
You know that. You are blessed.

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:55.360
So instead of complaining or being aggressive,

00:06:55.560 --> 00:07:00.320
you must know that it is a great ‘favour’ to you.

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:10.800
The greatest favour; that you are forgiven completely,

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:20.000
that this great blessing has been bestowed upon you.

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:27.520
And to come up to it you have to work hard.

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:39.560
Not to feel guilty about it but to be humble, to be thankful.

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:48.360
That despite what we have done, played with ourselves completely,

00:07:54.680 --> 00:08:03.240
still we are today sitting as God's Devas.

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:09.000
The Somrasa, which is the

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:21.040
charna amruta is the water that washes the Mother,

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:27.320
only you are allowed to drink it, only the Devas.

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:34.320
You are sitting in that category, and how can you be demanding?

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:38.680
You have to humble yourself.

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:44.000
By seeing your past, whatever mistakes we have committed.

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:50.280
I'm with you in this. Not to feel guilty.

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:56.000
It's very embarrassing as I said to you,

00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:03.640
but please try to face yourself. We have to face ourselves as we are.

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:12.720
The advantage of the Indians is that the Kundalini exists there.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:20.720
So whatever Indians may do, they are always aware it is wrong.

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:27.160
For them virtue is virtue, whether they are not virtuous.

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:29.680
Righteousness is righteousness, whether they are not.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.680
They know, all the time they are aware of it: "We are doing wrong."

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:40.560
They do not say: "What's wrong?" Nor do they propound things

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.040
which are obviously wrong and against the virginity, against the sublimity,

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:53.000
against the divinity. Satanic things, they never proclaim that this is God.

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:56.800
They are hypocritical, all right; but they are aware all the time

00:09:57.080 --> 00:10:00.480
that these things are wrong.

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:09.720
The whole society is like that.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.480
Because Kundalini stays there.

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:24.120
When we lose our innocence and our virginity, first thing happens to us

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:38.040
is that we become ego-oriented, and we start thinking "What's wrong?"

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:48.080
Your Shakti is your Kundalini and She is Virginity.

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:58.480
She is your power. She is your strength.

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:06.280
Your innocence is your strength, the day you lost it

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:15.000
that is the day we have committed the original sin.

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:24.080
So for us it is important that we have to be very humble about it,

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:30.120
and that we have to achieve something.

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:34.720
What?

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:43.200
Not the kingdoms and some sort of a luxurious life,

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:53.760
but a seat in this holy land of Shiva.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:02.240
Shiva is forgiveness. He forgives everyone.

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:05.760
Even the rakshasas can be forgiven,

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:10.400
but can they be given Realization?

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:19.480
Even the pishachas can be forgiven,

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:25.040
but can they be given Realization? Forgiven is different point.

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:32.200
One aspect is forgiveness, so that they can remain for a longer period,

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:37.240
they may live longer, because of Shiva's forgiveness. So what?

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:40.320
But what a wretched life!

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:51.600
And the people who are not innocent can never be joy-giving.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:57.080
They are themselves miserable creatures and make everyone miserable.

00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:18.040
The arrogance is not a child-like quality.

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:27.360
We have to be like children.

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:33.320
And even when you were not you were given Realization all right.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:44.240
But now you are sitting with the Devas, even higher than them.

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:53.680
So, what is our decoration? It is humility.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:02.000
It is simplicity. Not cleverness, arrogance,

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:15.760
putting others down, showing-off, but a complete surrender,

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:23.240
surrendering all your egoistical qualities.

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:30.000
Let the virginity be reborn within you.

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:41.200
From today you all have to take a vow, is a New Year's Day for us -

00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:53.760
that we all will surrender our horrible tempers,

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:59.400
dominating natures, asserting behaviors,

00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:16.280
ego-oriented harshness, domination.

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:20.800
I don't know what use it has.

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:26.720
Unless and until you surrender that,

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:38.280
The Lord of virginity, Shri Ganesha, will not be able to

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:49.080
crown your Agnya Chakra.

00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:07.600
Whatever we have done so far should just give us this:

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:15.280
if our past could give us the idea

00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:25.160
as to how humble we have to be with each other, with all the Sahaja Yogis,

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:40.120
how kind we have to be, how loving, how universal.

00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:53.120
Virgin cannot accept ideas which are not universal, She cannot!

00:16:53.320 --> 00:17:02.640
That's the sign of a Virgin because She is universal by nature.

00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:11.200
All fanaticism, all racialism, casteism,

00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:16.720
all these things which artificially separates man from man,

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000
woman from woman, nation from nation,

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:25.200
will all finish off, as soon as you become innocent.

00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:31.600
But you can't become by brain-washing, you cannot.

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:37.160
By Kundalini Awakening, of course, you can.

00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:44.240
But to maintain it, your progress should be inward

00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:51.720
and not outward, to seek your roots.

00:17:52.080 --> 00:18:01.000
She is the "moola". She is the roots of your being.

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:04.720
She manifests all your roots.

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:09.480
So your attention should be towards your roots

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:14.160
and not towards your shoots, you have been that.

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:20.720
Face yourself, and develop your roots now.

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:27.480
All the Western society is without the roots, we can see that.

00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:32.400
We have lost our roots; let's face it as Western people,

00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:36.080
as I am also with you today.

00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:42.200
We have to find our roots.

00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:47.000
You see, in a tree which does not have roots,

00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:52.200
it dries out, it doesn't give any shade,

00:18:52.360 --> 00:19:00.040
afterwards it becomes a dry horrible dying tree.

00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:04.640
When it dies, it falls upon someone.

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:11.400
It grows thorns, all dried things grow thorns.

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:18.240
It's like a desert, where only thorns can grow.

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:28.640
When the whole society becomes
so stupid as to hate each other,

00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:32.320
materialistic,

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:38.000
then roses are not going to grow there,

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:42.520
lotuses are not going to grow there,

00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:49.320
while you are the lotuses of this country.

00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:55.240
You are born in the mud all right, but now come back to yourself.

00:19:55.400 --> 00:20:04.480
You were beautiful. You are like lotuses, fell into this mud,

00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:07.520
became the mud,

00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:12.240
out of which you came out because of your true nature.

00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:18.800
Then you have become now lotuses, but there is no fragrance.

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:24.800
Lotus without a fragrance, one can't understand.

00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:29.480
Lotus has to have a fragrance.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:36.720
The fragrance that will overcome the filth of this mud.

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:40.160
You have to grow much more than Indians can grow.

00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:44.040
On the contrary, the arrogance of people, I am amazed.

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:47.000
They start complaining about this, complaining about that,

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:50.320
complaining about another thing.

00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:56.480
What do they think of themselves? Who are you?

00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:08.480
Because the roots are not developed. Once you'll develop your roots,

00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:13.760
immediately the humility will start coming into your temperament.

00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:23.720
There is artificial humility, not from the heart.

00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:31.560
It will only come when you become virgins, you become innocent.

00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:36.800
Innocence only doesn't mean morality, doesn't mean only that.

00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:42.640
Many people think that if you are a moral person - No.

00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:47.720
It also means non-materialistic attitude.

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:58.080
For people, carpet is more important than their children.

00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:03.480
Morning till evening they'll be saying harsh things

00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:10.480
just to save few nonsensical things which are going to be left here permanently.

00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:22.000
Materialism is the hit, it's the one that hits you, your innocence.

00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:34.480
If materialism means to make things to give others happiness,

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:44.280
to present others, as a cup that carries the nectar,

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:54.520
if materialism is that cup which gives the nectar of love, then it's all right.

00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:58.320
But you don't eat the cup, do you?

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:08.120
To Me, materialism sounds like people eating the cup, and not the nectar!

00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:12.240
Is cup more important, or the nectar?

00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:18.080
Supposing there's a golden cup and a poison is placed inside that,

00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:20.520
will you take it because it is in golden cup?

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:25.720
If you take it, of course, I will have more value for gold.

00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:33.080
Will anybody knowingly take a poison in a golden cup because it is in gold?

00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:38.520
No common sense! There's no common sense at all!

00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:44.240
That material things cannot give you happiness

00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:48.680
is the basic factor of economics.

00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:57.480
In My own lifetime I have seen, that anything material

00:23:57.640 --> 00:24:04.040
gives you greatest happiness when you can give it to someone.

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:20.320
I have seen that way, always. I enjoy the giving more than taking.

00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:29.200
I mean you try, sometimes, to give away something, and see how happy you feel.

00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:34.080
Of course, it should not be done because you want to get rid of it!

00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:41.080
Actually it is done for that only, perhaps.

00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:47.240
Because whatever you possess is a headache in any way - even the subtlest form.

00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:55.080
Any possession is like getting possessed. It's slavery.

00:24:56.560 --> 00:25:00.200
It hinders your freedom to grow.

00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:05.280
But it goes hand in hand. You know, people ask Me,

00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:10.720
"How it is these people, who are so affluent are so miserly?

00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:14.480
Why are they so miserly?" People can't understand, you know.

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:19.000
For 1 p if it is dearer, the whole England will be ablaze, you see.

00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:26.000
All the time what you hear is nothing - that so much percentage of rise

00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:30.320
in this thing and that, and they are going for a strike for this.

00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:35.280
I can't understand, how do you keep account of all that?

00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:40.360
If somebody asks Me what is the price of this sugar here and there,

00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:45.400
I wouldn't know, but I would just know that it's cheaper than the other place.

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:48.400
Because I am innocent.

00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:53.000
I'll get things absolutely cheapest always, I have seen that.

00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:59.400
I always get things cheapest because I am so innocent.

00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:02.720
My innocence takes Me to places where it is cheapest

00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:07.320
and I get the maximum joy,

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:15.560
because I can give it. I know how to give it.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:23.480
That's how I would say, because of the real force of your Spirit which is virginity,

00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:26.800
you have lost your, lost the sense of joy also.

00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:31.080
You are joy killers, morning till evening you are killing each other’s joy -

00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:35.240
to say harsh things, you see, from this tongue.

00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:39.720
I was folding My hands before you because I knew it would little bit upset you,

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:44.240
so I was just keeping it there, that your mind should not be disturbed so much.

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:49.400
In My palms, you see, very carefully I was catching your heart

00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:53.360
to keep it there, so that you should not feel hurt.

00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:59.120
Because it was not harsh, but it was truth which was harsh.

00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:05.480
But still, in My Palms I was holding it, carefully,

00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:10.360
so that you should not feel hurt about it.

00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:16.760
So to hurt anyone, just open your tongue and hurt anyone,

00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:19.760
one doesn't understand how many ripples of hatred

00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:22.800
you are creating within yourself.

00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:27.560
Twenty-four hours are not sufficient for Me to love people.

00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:32.240
Now, I will be sixty years of age,

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:35.120
I don't think I have done justification to these sixty years

00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:39.560
because I have not been able to love people as much as I wanted to.

00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:43.240
The flow is so great that I, My body suffers with that flow and sometimes

00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:48.800
I curse Myself that, "Why should I carry such a load of love within Myself?"

00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:52.600
And little excitement with the puja also.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.520
You know what happens to Me, I shudder.

00:27:55.720 --> 00:28:00.520
Sometimes, you are calling Me for puja, now what will happen?

00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:12.080
Then somebody can ask a question sometimes,

00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:15.080
"Mother, did we not suck Your vibrations?"

00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:17.720
Is obvious, but I don't want to say that.

00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:22.000
Because if I say that, your Vishuddhi will be caught up.

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:26.560
Again you will suck less.

00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:32.880
It's a very delicate work I have to do.

00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:39.080
You are already wounded people,

00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:43.480
because you have wounded yourself. Nobody has done this harm to you,

00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:48.120
you people have nicely wounded yourself, very nicely.

00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:53.040
Every way possible you have tried to hurt yourself.

00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:55.400
Now because of the hurt, the guilt is built-in

00:28:55.600 --> 00:29:00.560
and you are hurting others. It is as simple as that.

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:06.200
So don't hurt yourself, there is no need to hurt yourself.

00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:11.080
But remember that we have no business to be harsh to anyone.

00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:19.800
We have to be sweet people. We have to be kind people.

00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:25.400
There are also psychologists who have come forward to give you explanation

00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:28.600
for your harshness, that, "Your will-power should be strong.

00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:31.160
If you don't talk like that others will take advantage."

00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:36.800
Who can take advantage of the western people?

00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:41.560
It is absurd, absolutely absurd!

00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:45.400
The ones who have done injustice all over the world should say such a thing,

00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:51.160
it's absurd, I cannot understand how can they give an explanation like that!

00:29:57.040 --> 00:30:01.000
But now the time has come.

00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:09.360
You are the people who are going to change the mind of God

00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:15.000
with your good behavior.

00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:20.000
The wrathful God, you are going to please Him.

00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:26.160
You are going to represent that area which sucks in the compassion of God.

00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:31.080
Ask for His compassion! Do you deserve it?

00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:33.560
If you don't deserve it,

00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:39.600
who is going to deserve it in this western world - you tell Me - today?

00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:48.000
You are the ones chosen for this, specially prepared for this, to create an area

00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:59.400
so that the deity of compassion should be awakened, for the rest of them.

00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:06.400
The arrogance, you have seen in the spread of Sahaja Yoga, what happened:

00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:10.720
we had a program where we had, say, a thousand people.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:17.320
For the next follow up there are only three. It's typical.

00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:28.520
I have spent most of My precious time in this country, and in the West.

00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:39.040
Despite that, the arrogance sometimes baffles Me.

00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:44.080
Arrogance among each other, even towards Me sometimes they are so arrogant,

00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:49.080
I cannot think of anyone being that arrogant to Me, as the way they are.

00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:52.160
The way they talk to Me, the way they behave towards Me,

00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:55.800
I just can't understand how can they be like that.

00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:09.040
It can be anyway, anywhere, anytime, especially women.

00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:12.760
I was amazed, I went to Belgium, and I found

00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:17.400
that Belgian housewives were even worse than Indian… than British housewives.

00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:23.720
Ah! Terrific, terrific women! Ah! Just horrible!

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:28.320
Absolutely. You just don't know how to deal with them, it's terrific!

00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:31.720
They control the whole household into their hands, I don't know how.

00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:36.560
Only, I don't know how they do it. There's no ... (interruption in recording).

00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:41.400
So ego-oriented, I am amazed!

00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:48.200
But if you go to America, American women are baba, they are Amazonic!

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:55.680
Horrible! You just can't understand, there's no love, no affection, nothing.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:59.600
Showing off, all the time talking about their material things,

00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:03.680
absolutely dry sticks, I tell you. And they want Realization,

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:09.320
and they want to be great, and this and that. I don't know. What are they?

00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:17.560
Today it's especially the day of virginity.

00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:31.320
I have really great hopes from the women of this country, especially.

00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:35.040
Here the men don't talk at all, you see, the pattern was worst in Belgium,

00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:41.200
no man would talk a word. They cannot talk, just poor things are just shut.

00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:45.240
They don't talk, strangled, completely strangled by women,

00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:52.240
believe Me. Horrible! What is going to happen to that country, you see,

00:33:52.400 --> 00:34:00.200
where men can't talk and women talk? It's horrifying, let us face it up.

00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:02.680
What have they achieved, the women there?

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:06.720
At least, in India, our Prime Minister is a woman.

00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:11.680
What are they? Good for nothing, useless, just washing utensils in the house

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:15.640
and showing off. I just don't understand.

00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:18.080
What sacrifices they can go up to?

00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:22.080
The woman is known by the amount of sacrifices she makes.

00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:27.280
It's a challenge, I tell you, for all of you women who are Realized Souls

00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:32.520
to see to it, that you humble down yourself.

00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:35.560
Your quality cannot improve unless and until you humble down.

00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:39.800
On everything you assert. For what?

00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:53.000
It's impossible to worship Virgin when we are so arrogant and so strangling type.

00:34:53.520 --> 00:35:01.320
The Virgin is a simple woman. She's extremely simple.

00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:10.480
She doesn't understand what are your plans and what is so important, everything.

00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:13.240
Her importance is Her virginity, that She knows,

00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:16.720
and She will not allow anybody to touch [it?].

00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:24.480
That's Her property, that's Her wealth, that's Her greatness.

00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:33.800
And She's humble because She's not afraid of anyone.

00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:36.600
She's not aggressive.

00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:44.080
But She doesn't allow anybody to aggress; nobody dare aggress a real Virgin.

00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:58.120
A new page has been turned now, in Sahaja Yoga.

00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:03.760
I must warn you all about it.

00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:08.560
Don't take liberties too much with Sahaja Yoga.

00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:15.000
You are not obliging anyone else but yourself, be careful.

00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:21.000
Take up My warnings always seriously.

00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:26.360
You all have to come up very well now.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:34.360
It is not only doing My puja is going to help you, I can tell you this much.

00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:38.320
Now you better worship yourself.

00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:44.320
You have to worship all your Gods within you. Cleanse them.

00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:51.160
First is the God and the Goddess of humility,

00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:55.480
of innocence, of simplicity.

00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:04.400
Worship that.

00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:09.680
Unless and until you can worship that,

00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:13.680
you cannot go further, you will not be protected.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:19.320
Again I say that a new page has been turned.

00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:23.320
Don't take liberties with Sahaja Yoga.

00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:30.760
It has bestowed all the blessings upon you. You have seen the light of the day.

00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:36.800
But be prepared for the night.

00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:46.360
Nobody should try to take liberties. Try to improve yourself.

00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:52.640
No more complaints.

00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:59.320
If you can't live in an Ashram like that, you better get out of it.

00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:07.080
It's not for your convenience. Nobody is in need of you. Take it from Me.

00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:12.200
Nobody is in need of you, you have to be in need of your Self.

00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:16.400
If you are seekers, if you want to find your roots,

00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:20.320
everything is available for you.

00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:31.600
But you have to be humble, to go down to the roots, not with arrogance.

00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:38.000
We must understand why we are not progressing.

00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:56.280
Actually arrogance comes to people who lack Self-confidence.

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:05.360
Self-confidence is shattered to people whose Self is not manifesting.

00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:09.400
Let your Self manifest.

00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:14.320
When the Self is not manifesting, you get all kinds of problems,

00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:19.400
and then you complain. Actually the problem resides within you.

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:26.080
It is God who has to complain.

00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:32.000
Think of it. The One who has created this universe,

00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:37.520
the One who has created you all with such love and affection,

00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:41.760
the One who has given you everything under the sun,

00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:47.160
also the One who has given you Realization, given you light;

00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:57.360
everything that is possible and you are complaining against Him?

00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:07.120
You should not. Complain about yourself,

00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:13.720
that, "I am not all right, I should be all right."

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:17.720
Complain about it, face yourself.

00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:23.360
Like children, when they face the mirror, they say,

00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:27.040
"This is somebody else." But we believe.

00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:32.400
They never identify themselves with their own images that they see.

00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:37.320
They are identified with the image that they 'are'.

00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:41.480
They don't create artificial images or don't dwell with the images

00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:49.640
which are making them feel ego-oriented.

00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:57.480
They live with reality as it is. We are made like that.

00:40:57.680 --> 00:41:09.280
You see a camera, if it takes some photograph under a light

00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:19.200
which is not, maybe, some other color, the photograph could be different.

00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:26.320
Supposing, I am wearing a red thing and supposing, you put a light that is blue,

00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:30.040
this might start looking green.

00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:36.000
But human eyes will see always the same thing.

00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:41.600
It won't see something unreal. Camera can do all that.

00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:46.160
Camera can remove somebody's head and put somebody's head there.

00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:51.000
All these tricks are possible with camera but not with human eyes.

00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:53.120
Whatever you see is the thing that.

00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:55.800
Of course, [if] you are drunk, then [it's] different.

00:41:56.080 --> 00:41:59.680
I mean, I am not... I am saying of normal conditions, you see.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:05.320
In normal condition, you see what exactly exists.

00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:13.480
But if you are ego-oriented, you will never see yourself what exists.

00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:18.400
You will see some sort of a bloated, you see, you will think yourself to the,

00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:22.760
be the King of God's Heavens, you see.

00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:27.400
You can see, if you want to; is imagination.

00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:31.720
If you put your imagination like that, you can see yourself as anything!

00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:35.160
Which is false, is absolute false!

00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:46.240
You are your Self and you must see yourself as your Self, as your Spirit.

00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:57.000
And Spirit is the universal being, is the innocence, is the Virgin within you.

00:42:57.480 --> 00:43:02.600
Respect it, respect that part of yours which is the Virgin - still exists -

00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:07.280
because if it was not there, I could never have given you Realization.

00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:11.720
Despite every attack, it existed there, be sure on that point.

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:17.080
If it had not existed, you could not have got your Realization.

00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:19.080
So many of them, they are very proud,

00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:23.360
"Oh! I don't feel anything, Mother, you know, it's nothing."

00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:28.000
Then there is to be, more to be ashamed!

00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:33.760
Or at least you feel that you are missing something, isn't it?

00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:36.120
At least, you should feel that you are missing,

00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:39.480
if something is not all right and you should be all right.

00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:42.240
At least think like that, "I should be all right, I am not all right."

00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:48.200
On the contrary, "No, no, I didn't feel. Oh, what, I didn't feel, I should feel."

00:43:52.480 --> 00:44:03.240
So the wisdom. Wisdom is the part that is innocence. It's complete wisdom.

00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:09.720
You find this among the villagers or very simple people.

00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:14.320
They are not cunning in any way. You try to befool them and you'll be amazed,

00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:18.600
at the end of it you'll find, "I'm such a big mad fat fool myself."

00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:22.320
Try that with some rustic people, who are very simple, matter of fact,

00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:24.680
who live with the Mother soil.

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:30.000
You will find that all those so-called intellectuals,

00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:35.080
if they try to befool a simple man like that,

00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:42.800
after half-an-hour, this educated and very M.A.D., Ph. D. style

00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:51.480
will find that he is 'the biggest fool ever born'.

00:44:57.520 --> 00:45:05.160
There is a saying in Sanskrit, which is very common: "Vidya vinaye na shobhate."

00:45:05.320 --> 00:45:12.520
That is Vidya, even the knowledge, is decorated.

00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:16.320
Shobhate means gets its decorations or...

00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:19.160
What is shobha? Sahaja Yogi: Glory. Shri Mataji: Beautified.

00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:24.000
Sahaja Yogi: Beauty.Yes. Shri Mataji: ...is beautified only through humility.

00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:34.080
If there is an educated man, he has to be a humble person.

00:45:34.280 --> 00:45:40.240
If he is not a humble person, then he is not educated at all, in any way.

00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:44.600
I don't know if I have told you a story

00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:57.640
about one saint was meditating and was blind.

00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:07.600
And a king came there and asked him, "Did you see some people around?"

00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:13.800
He said, "Yes. Yes, king, my king. Sit down.

00:46:14.080 --> 00:46:20.520
I saw your servant coming, and then your minister came in,

00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:26.160
and then the Prime minister came in, and then now you have come".

00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:30.760
He said, "You are blind, how did you know?

00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:34.480
Through your meditation?" He said, "No. Common sense".

00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:43.320
He said, "What is the common sense?" He said, "The first, the servant came in.

00:46:43.480 --> 00:46:50.480
He said, "What, you are bogus fellow sitting down here, wasting your time?"

00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:55.000
He gave me two-three abuses, used bad language,

00:46:55.160 --> 00:47:03.000
and said, "Have you seen any person here?" So I said, "No."

00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:13.040
Then the minister came in. He didn't abuse me, but he just asked me.

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:17.640
Then the Prime minister came.

00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:24.200
He said, "Sir" to me. - Must have been from England.

00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:32.760
And might have said also "Thank you", perhaps -

00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:46.080
"And then came the king." And he (the saint) said that,

00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:50.520
"You were extremely humble. You first touched my feet,

00:47:50.720 --> 00:48:02.320
you sat down on the Mother Earth, waited for me to ask you,

00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:09.200
"What do you want?" And in a very humble way you said,

00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:17.080
"If you have heard of people around you" -

00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:27.320
because I am blind, so you didn't say something that would hurt me,

00:48:27.480 --> 00:48:31.480
in such a humble way - if I could tell you.

00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:39.040
But at least hundred and eight names of the Guru you took, before you asked me this.

00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:47.000
So I know you are the learned, you are the humblest, and so you must be the king."

00:48:47.160 --> 00:48:53.480
Otherwise, in those days, at least we never had kings or Prime ministers

00:48:54.320 --> 00:49:00.320
who were box-office actors.

00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:15.720
Even the public was so innocent that they would not accept such nonsense, you see.

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:19.320
So this was the difference.

00:49:19.480 --> 00:49:32.240
From this story we have to derive that the more we are learned into Vidya,

00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:40.800
into the technique of Sahaja Yoga, we have to be humble.

00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:48.320
That is our decoration, that is our certificate,

00:49:48.520 --> 00:49:58.000
that is the path into the entrance of every human being,

00:49:59.360 --> 00:50:08.080
that is the way we are going to be very close to the other seekers.

00:50:08.280 --> 00:50:15.320
To be humble, to find out ways and methods of being humble.

00:50:19.320 --> 00:50:32.800
This is the key of Nirmala Vidya, how to be humble.

00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:43.640
By humility you will not ever say, "This is my bathroom",

00:50:43.800 --> 00:50:48.480
or "This is my fruit", or "This is my food",

00:50:48.680 --> 00:50:54.320
or "This is my table", and "This is my glass".

00:50:57.080 --> 00:51:06.560
Innocence gives you the strength to enjoy

00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:14.560
everything that is there. I mean, for Me, sometimes I have to eat with bhoots,

00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:18.720
and sometimes I have to eat bhoots.

00:51:19.320 --> 00:51:27.560
Not only eat with them, but also eat them - it's the worst part.

00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:39.640
So, you also should not mind if there are people with bhoots.

00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:47.080
If they are arrogant, try to give them bandhans

00:51:47.240 --> 00:51:51.320
try to control them through all these methods.

00:51:51.480 --> 00:51:55.600
But if you think by arguing with them you will be able to manage them,

00:51:55.760 --> 00:52:05.320
it's an impossibility. So try Nirmala Vidya, and that is humility,

00:52:06.200 --> 00:52:11.760
which is the myelin sheath of vibrations.

00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:15.000
Like every nerve has a myelin sheath covering it,

00:52:15.160 --> 00:52:20.520
in the same way is the humility, is the myelin sheath.

00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:27.320
If you are humble, you will win the battle, if you are not, we'll be lost.

00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:34.720
Then the whole thing will become a joke for you, absolute joke.

00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:41.240
If you are humble, you can see the stupid, the bhoots

00:52:41.400 --> 00:52:48.520
and all the arrogant as clowns of this drama.

00:52:49.560 --> 00:52:57.760
Try to be humble with your Self, and with Me. With Me is very important.

00:52:58.080 --> 00:53:02.720
You must understand that it is one of the conditions

00:53:03.040 --> 00:53:10.360
that Christ has put on you, so be careful. Dealing with Me,

00:53:10.560 --> 00:53:17.080
I don't want you to be in any way rude to Me, because I can't help it there.

00:53:17.320 --> 00:53:21.320
Till you are humble with Me, everything is in My charge.

00:53:21.480 --> 00:53:27.680
But as soon as you are rude to Me, somebody else and so many of them,

00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:33.760
thousands of them take charge, and then don't blame Me for that,

00:53:34.080 --> 00:53:41.000
because you are My protégés, you are under My protection.

00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:45.400
Supposing you try to make holes in your roof,

00:53:45.600 --> 00:53:50.360
and then say that the rain is coming in. What can you do about it?

00:53:50.560 --> 00:53:53.720
I mean, the hole... you have already made the holes in your roof.

00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:59.080
The roof that was to protect you, you have made holes, now the rain has to come in.

00:53:59.280 --> 00:54:03.680
Then if you want that the roof still should protect you from the rain,

00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:11.520
then I must say you lack intelligence. That's what it is.

00:54:11.720 --> 00:54:16.480
So this is the another warning.

00:54:16.680 --> 00:54:24.520
It's very embarrassing, but again today is the day of embarrassment as it is.

00:54:24.720 --> 00:54:29.240
Because the Virgin is in embarrassed condition always,

00:54:29.400 --> 00:54:33.680
She is a bashful personality. She has to be bashful, you see.

00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:41.080
She is embarrassed to say things which She does not want to say.

00:54:41.240 --> 00:54:43.800
Of course, that's a very sweet thing,

00:54:44.080 --> 00:54:49.080
even there She is bashful, to say harsh thing is a horrible stuff.

00:54:49.240 --> 00:54:59.200
So let us worship our virginity within ourselves. Let us rise up to that point

00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:10.640
to mount that diamond of brilliance of our virginity,

00:55:11.760 --> 00:55:17.000
in the setting of our humility.

00:55:19.680 --> 00:55:27.480
You can be angry with others, not with Sahaja Yogis, not with Me.

00:55:28.040 --> 00:55:33.760
Even with others, when it is absolutely required.

00:55:35.680 --> 00:55:40.000
But if you fight among yourselves, and tell people about Sahaja Yoga,

00:55:40.120 --> 00:55:43.080
nobody is going to believe you.

00:55:45.600 --> 00:55:49.080
And that is why today is the day

00:55:49.280 --> 00:55:59.000
when the Virgin Gauri sat down to worship Shiva.

00:55:59.760 --> 00:56:06.280
She made a Shiva Linga and was sitting and putting Her sindur on that,

00:56:06.720 --> 00:56:12.720
"That you look after this, which is the mark of My union with You.

00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:19.000
I leave it to You to look after, to Shiva. You look after this.

00:56:19.160 --> 00:56:25.120
I surrender to You." For this, that’s how the Gauri,

00:56:25.320 --> 00:56:30.600
your Kundalini, surrenders to the Spirit. "Now you look after this connection.

00:56:30.760 --> 00:56:35.800
I forget everything else. I leave it into Your hands. Lift me up.

00:56:36.080 --> 00:56:41.640
You raise me up. I forget all that was me before.

00:56:41.800 --> 00:56:45.640
Everything I have dropped out. No other desire.

00:56:45.800 --> 00:56:51.000
But just lift me higher and higher. Make me Yourself.

00:56:51.160 --> 00:56:56.080
The rest of it is not important. All other manifestations of these desires are over.

00:56:56.240 --> 00:57:00.240
Now, I am absolutely surrendered to You, my Spirit.

00:57:00.400 --> 00:57:05.480
Lift me higher and higher. Higher and higher,

00:57:05.680 --> 00:57:13.160
away from all the things that were not the Spirit.

00:57:14.640 --> 00:57:20.800
Make me complete Spirit, full Spirit."

00:57:21.080 --> 00:57:25.040
Forget all that was there.

00:57:25.520 --> 00:57:34.040
That elevation, that ascent

00:57:34.520 --> 00:57:46.080
becomes a fast, quick trip, a very fast ascent.

00:57:46.280 --> 00:57:52.760
Just you can do it if you try at this moment and every moment

00:57:53.040 --> 00:57:59.120
to give up all that was not the Spirit.

00:57:59.320 --> 00:58:03.320
Anything that goes against the Spirit must be given up.

00:58:03.480 --> 00:58:07.600
And that is what is the pure desire,

00:58:07.760 --> 00:58:11.720
that's what it is the Kundalini, is the Virgin.

00:58:12.040 --> 00:58:16.080
Is to be absolutely one with the Spirit.

00:58:16.240 --> 00:58:26.240
All the rest has no meaning, has no value.

00:58:29.160 --> 00:58:34.080
This ascent - whatever may be your position,

00:58:34.240 --> 00:58:37.800
to whomsoever you may be married, wherever you are working,

00:58:38.080 --> 00:58:41.680
whatever is your situation, whatever may be your country,

00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:49.320
you are the Spirit. And if you are raised aloft,

00:58:49.480 --> 00:59:01.400
you will dwell in the beautiful kingdom of God, where all ugliness drops out.

00:59:01.600 --> 00:59:09.760
Like when the lotus opens out, all the mud drops out, completely.

00:59:10.080 --> 00:59:15.360
In the same way, let My children become the fragrant,

00:59:15.560 --> 00:59:20.040
beautiful offerings of Sadashiva.

00:59:20.200 --> 00:59:23.680
May God bless you.
