WEBVTT

00:10.080 --> 00:16.280
It's a great thing today that we are celebrating

00:18.080 --> 00:24.560
the Virgin’s worship in England.

00:31.480 --> 00:36.560
As you know, according to Sahaja Yoga,

00:37.320 --> 00:44.040
England is the heart where resides the Spirit of Shiva.

00:46.720 --> 00:51.480
And that Virgin should be respected and revered

00:52.200 --> 00:55.520
and worshipped in England

01:00.720 --> 01:06.160
is a great honor, I think, for all the Sahaja Yogis.

01:11.680 --> 01:26.000
Now one has to think why such an importance is paid to a Virgin?

01:28.320 --> 01:39.480
Why a Virgin is respected to that extent?

01:41.000 --> 01:44.760
What are the powers of a Virgin?

01:51.320 --> 01:55.120
That She can bear a child

01:57.640 --> 02:04.360
of that magnitude that was Christ,

02:04.640 --> 02:15.400
that She could create Shri Ganesha out of Her own body,

02:18.320 --> 02:29.560
that She could protect innocent, dynamic force of Her children

02:30.760 --> 02:36.320
who are egoless, who have not known what is ego.

02:43.040 --> 02:57.040
So this great power and force resides

03:02.520 --> 03:11.000
in a person who has lots of 'guru punyas' [guru virtues],

03:11.320 --> 03:16.000
who has done lots of good things in previous lives,

03:22.040 --> 03:30.080
who has always understood

03:32.560 --> 03:38.680
that Virginity is a power higher than any other power and

03:39.000 --> 03:52.800
would save the Virginity and Chastity with all Her effort and care.

04:00.320 --> 04:07.000
As you know that within our body She is placed as Kundalini,

04:09.560 --> 04:12.800
means She is the Virgin.

04:15.480 --> 04:17.560
She is untouched,

04:17.720 --> 04:28.160
the desire to become Spirit is without any blemish, "nirmala".

04:30.720 --> 04:34.040
There is no blemish.

04:38.120 --> 04:41.480
Its waiting is pure.

04:45.040 --> 04:53.640
There's no other desire but to be one with the Divine.

04:54.480 --> 05:00.000
All other desires are finished.

05:06.320 --> 05:15.720
It's a very difficult subject for Me to talk about in the Western country.

05:16.000 --> 05:22.720
It's embarrassing. I do not want any one of you, whether men or women,

05:23.000 --> 05:28.560
to develop any guilt in your mind.

05:30.160 --> 05:33.000
Because that is one thing is the greatest blemish as you know,

05:33.160 --> 05:42.040
at a later stage this guilt works in the opposite direction.

05:42.520 --> 05:45.360
It is of no help.

05:50.800 --> 05:56.240
But when we understand that we have these problems,

05:57.000 --> 06:02.040
we have to be humble about it. Not guilty but humble.

06:06.680 --> 06:19.520
If you are not humble about it, and aggressive about demanding

06:21.360 --> 06:23.480
what have you got out of Sahaja Yoga

06:23.640 --> 06:26.000
and complaining about it all the time,

06:26.120 --> 06:34.120
while not seeing what are your own punyas, what do you deserve?

06:36.160 --> 06:43.600
Your Kundalini, despite every blemish, has been raised.

06:43.760 --> 06:49.320
You know that. You are blessed.

06:51.280 --> 06:55.360
So instead of complaining or being aggressive,

06:55.560 --> 07:00.320
you must know that it is a great ‘favour’ to you.

07:02.800 --> 07:10.800
The greatest favour; that you are forgiven completely,

07:15.120 --> 07:20.000
that this great blessing has been bestowed upon you.

07:20.160 --> 07:27.520
And to come up to it you have to work hard.

07:31.200 --> 07:39.560
Not to feel guilty about it but to be humble, to be thankful.

07:41.280 --> 07:48.360
That despite what we have done, played with ourselves completely,

07:54.680 --> 08:03.240
still we are today sitting as God's Devas.

08:04.680 --> 08:09.000
The Somrasa, which is the

08:13.080 --> 08:21.040
charna amruta is the water that washes the Mother,

08:21.400 --> 08:27.320
only you are allowed to drink it, only the Devas.

08:27.760 --> 08:34.320
You are sitting in that category, and how can you be demanding?

08:35.480 --> 08:38.680
You have to humble yourself.

08:39.480 --> 08:44.000
By seeing your past, whatever mistakes we have committed.

08:44.160 --> 08:50.280
I'm with you in this. Not to feel guilty.

08:52.040 --> 08:56.000
It's very embarrassing as I said to you,

08:57.480 --> 09:03.640
but please try to face yourself. We have to face ourselves as we are.

09:05.560 --> 09:12.720
The advantage of the Indians is that the Kundalini exists there.

09:13.000 --> 09:20.720
So whatever Indians may do, they are always aware it is wrong.

09:21.560 --> 09:27.160
For them virtue is virtue, whether they are not virtuous.

09:27.320 --> 09:29.680
Righteousness is righteousness, whether they are not.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.680
They know, all the time they are aware of it: "We are doing wrong."

09:32.800 --> 09:40.560
They do not say: "What's wrong?" Nor do they propound things

09:41.000 --> 09:45.040
which are obviously wrong and against the virginity, against the sublimity,

09:45.200 --> 09:53.000
against the divinity. Satanic things, they never proclaim that this is God.

09:53.240 --> 09:56.800
They are hypocritical, all right; but they are aware all the time

09:57.080 --> 10:00.480
that these things are wrong.

10:02.720 --> 10:09.720
The whole society is like that.

10:13.000 --> 10:17.480
Because Kundalini stays there.

10:18.800 --> 10:24.120
When we lose our innocence and our virginity, first thing happens to us

10:24.320 --> 10:38.040
is that we become ego-oriented, and we start thinking "What's wrong?"

10:40.360 --> 10:48.080
Your Shakti is your Kundalini and She is Virginity.

10:50.320 --> 10:58.480
She is your power. She is your strength.

11:01.680 --> 11:06.280
Your innocence is your strength, the day you lost it

11:06.480 --> 11:15.000
that is the day we have committed the original sin.

11:16.720 --> 11:24.080
So for us it is important that we have to be very humble about it,

11:26.360 --> 11:30.120
and that we have to achieve something.

11:32.360 --> 11:34.720
What?

11:35.240 --> 11:43.200
Not the kingdoms and some sort of a luxurious life,

11:46.480 --> 11:53.760
but a seat in this holy land of Shiva.

11:57.000 --> 12:02.240
Shiva is forgiveness. He forgives everyone.

12:02.400 --> 12:05.760
Even the rakshasas can be forgiven,

12:06.080 --> 12:10.400
but can they be given Realization?

12:16.800 --> 12:19.480
Even the pishachas can be forgiven,

12:19.600 --> 12:25.040
but can they be given Realization? Forgiven is different point.

12:26.560 --> 12:32.200
One aspect is forgiveness, so that they can remain for a longer period,

12:32.360 --> 12:37.240
they may live longer, because of Shiva's forgiveness. So what?

12:37.400 --> 12:40.320
But what a wretched life!

12:45.320 --> 12:51.600
And the people who are not innocent can never be joy-giving.

12:52.000 --> 12:57.080
They are themselves miserable creatures and make everyone miserable.

13:06.280 --> 13:18.040
The arrogance is not a child-like quality.

13:23.560 --> 13:27.360
We have to be like children.

13:28.480 --> 13:33.320
And even when you were not you were given Realization all right.

13:34.000 --> 13:44.240
But now you are sitting with the Devas, even higher than them.

13:45.760 --> 13:53.680
So, what is our decoration? It is humility.

13:55.000 --> 14:02.000
It is simplicity. Not cleverness, arrogance,

14:07.080 --> 14:15.760
putting others down, showing-off, but a complete surrender,

14:18.760 --> 14:23.240
surrendering all your egoistical qualities.

14:24.720 --> 14:30.000
Let the virginity be reborn within you.

14:31.400 --> 14:41.200
From today you all have to take a vow, is a New Year's Day for us -

14:42.240 --> 14:53.760
that we all will surrender our horrible tempers,

14:54.080 --> 14:59.400
dominating natures, asserting behaviors,

15:03.640 --> 15:16.280
ego-oriented harshness, domination.

15:16.480 --> 15:20.800
I don't know what use it has.

15:22.720 --> 15:26.720
Unless and until you surrender that,

15:27.160 --> 15:38.280
The Lord of virginity, Shri Ganesha, will not be able to

15:45.400 --> 15:49.080
crown your Agnya Chakra.

15:59.080 --> 16:07.600
Whatever we have done so far should just give us this:

16:09.240 --> 16:15.280
if our past could give us the idea

16:15.480 --> 16:25.160
as to how humble we have to be with each other, with all the Sahaja Yogis,

16:29.360 --> 16:40.120
how kind we have to be, how loving, how universal.

16:44.040 --> 16:53.120
Virgin cannot accept ideas which are not universal, She cannot!

16:53.320 --> 17:02.640
That's the sign of a Virgin because She is universal by nature.

17:05.600 --> 17:11.200
All fanaticism, all racialism, casteism,

17:11.360 --> 17:16.720
all these things which artificially separates man from man,

17:17.000 --> 17:20.000
woman from woman, nation from nation,

17:20.160 --> 17:25.200
will all finish off, as soon as you become innocent.

17:27.240 --> 17:31.600
But you can't become by brain-washing, you cannot.

17:32.080 --> 17:37.160
By Kundalini Awakening, of course, you can.

17:37.320 --> 17:44.240
But to maintain it, your progress should be inward

17:45.480 --> 17:51.720
and not outward, to seek your roots.

17:52.080 --> 18:01.000
She is the "moola". She is the roots of your being.

18:01.120 --> 18:04.720
She manifests all your roots.

18:05.400 --> 18:09.480
So your attention should be towards your roots

18:09.680 --> 18:14.160
and not towards your shoots, you have been that.

18:14.560 --> 18:20.720
Face yourself, and develop your roots now.

18:22.480 --> 18:27.480
All the Western society is without the roots, we can see that.

18:28.040 --> 18:32.400
We have lost our roots; let's face it as Western people,

18:32.600 --> 18:36.080
as I am also with you today.

18:38.080 --> 18:42.200
We have to find our roots.

18:42.360 --> 18:47.000
You see, in a tree which does not have roots,

18:47.120 --> 18:52.200
it dries out, it doesn't give any shade,

18:52.360 --> 19:00.040
afterwards it becomes a dry horrible dying tree.

19:00.200 --> 19:04.640
When it dies, it falls upon someone.

19:05.640 --> 19:11.400
It grows thorns, all dried things grow thorns.

19:12.640 --> 19:18.240
It's like a desert, where only thorns can grow.

19:18.400 --> 19:28.640
When the whole society becomes
so stupid as to hate each other,

19:29.280 --> 19:32.320
materialistic,

19:33.040 --> 19:38.000
then roses are not going to grow there,

19:38.480 --> 19:42.520
lotuses are not going to grow there,

19:44.600 --> 19:49.320
while you are the lotuses of this country.

19:49.480 --> 19:55.240
You are born in the mud all right, but now come back to yourself.

19:55.400 --> 20:04.480
You were beautiful. You are like lotuses, fell into this mud,

20:04.680 --> 20:07.520
became the mud,

20:07.720 --> 20:12.240
out of which you came out because of your true nature.

20:12.400 --> 20:18.800
Then you have become now lotuses, but there is no fragrance.

20:20.440 --> 20:24.800
Lotus without a fragrance, one can't understand.

20:25.720 --> 20:29.480
Lotus has to have a fragrance.

20:30.000 --> 20:36.720
The fragrance that will overcome the filth of this mud.

20:37.440 --> 20:40.160
You have to grow much more than Indians can grow.

20:40.320 --> 20:44.040
On the contrary, the arrogance of people, I am amazed.

20:44.200 --> 20:47.000
They start complaining about this, complaining about that,

20:47.120 --> 20:50.320
complaining about another thing.

20:51.480 --> 20:56.480
What do they think of themselves? Who are you?

21:04.120 --> 21:08.480
Because the roots are not developed. Once you'll develop your roots,

21:08.640 --> 21:13.760
immediately the humility will start coming into your temperament.

21:16.680 --> 21:23.720
There is artificial humility, not from the heart.

21:24.280 --> 21:31.560
It will only come when you become virgins, you become innocent.

21:31.720 --> 21:36.800
Innocence only doesn't mean morality, doesn't mean only that.

21:37.080 --> 21:42.640
Many people think that if you are a moral person - No.

21:43.320 --> 21:47.720
It also means non-materialistic attitude.

21:52.480 --> 21:58.080
For people, carpet is more important than their children.

22:00.080 --> 22:03.480
Morning till evening they'll be saying harsh things

22:03.640 --> 22:10.480
just to save few nonsensical things which are going to be left here permanently.

22:12.480 --> 22:22.000
Materialism is the hit, it's the one that hits you, your innocence.

22:27.080 --> 22:34.480
If materialism means to make things to give others happiness,

22:34.640 --> 22:44.280
to present others, as a cup that carries the nectar,

22:44.480 --> 22:54.520
if materialism is that cup which gives the nectar of love, then it's all right.

22:54.720 --> 22:58.320
But you don't eat the cup, do you?

22:59.000 --> 23:08.120
To Me, materialism sounds like people eating the cup, and not the nectar!

23:08.320 --> 23:12.240
Is cup more important, or the nectar?

23:12.400 --> 23:18.080
Supposing there's a golden cup and a poison is placed inside that,

23:18.240 --> 23:20.520
will you take it because it is in golden cup?

23:20.720 --> 23:25.720
If you take it, of course, I will have more value for gold.

23:26.280 --> 23:33.080
Will anybody knowingly take a poison in a golden cup because it is in gold?

23:34.200 --> 23:38.520
No common sense! There's no common sense at all!

23:38.720 --> 23:44.240
That material things cannot give you happiness

23:44.560 --> 23:48.680
is the basic factor of economics.

23:51.320 --> 23:57.480
In My own lifetime I have seen, that anything material

23:57.640 --> 24:04.040
gives you greatest happiness when you can give it to someone.

24:08.160 --> 24:20.320
I have seen that way, always. I enjoy the giving more than taking.

24:21.320 --> 24:29.200
I mean you try, sometimes, to give away something, and see how happy you feel.

24:29.360 --> 24:34.080
Of course, it should not be done because you want to get rid of it!

24:37.720 --> 24:41.080
Actually it is done for that only, perhaps.

24:41.280 --> 24:47.240
Because whatever you possess is a headache in any way - even the subtlest form.

24:47.520 --> 24:55.080
Any possession is like getting possessed. It's slavery.

24:56.560 --> 25:00.200
It hinders your freedom to grow.

25:02.280 --> 25:05.280
But it goes hand in hand. You know, people ask Me,

25:05.480 --> 25:10.720
"How it is these people, who are so affluent are so miserly?

25:11.080 --> 25:14.480
Why are they so miserly?" People can't understand, you know.

25:14.640 --> 25:19.000
For 1 p if it is dearer, the whole England will be ablaze, you see.

25:19.120 --> 25:26.000
All the time what you hear is nothing - that so much percentage of rise

25:26.160 --> 25:30.320
in this thing and that, and they are going for a strike for this.

25:30.520 --> 25:35.280
I can't understand, how do you keep account of all that?

25:36.480 --> 25:40.360
If somebody asks Me what is the price of this sugar here and there,

25:40.560 --> 25:45.400
I wouldn't know, but I would just know that it's cheaper than the other place.

25:45.600 --> 25:48.400
Because I am innocent.

25:49.480 --> 25:53.000
I'll get things absolutely cheapest always, I have seen that.

25:53.120 --> 25:59.400
I always get things cheapest because I am so innocent.

25:59.600 --> 26:02.720
My innocence takes Me to places where it is cheapest

26:02.960 --> 26:07.320
and I get the maximum joy,

26:07.480 --> 26:15.560
because I can give it. I know how to give it.

26:18.000 --> 26:23.480
That's how I would say, because of the real force of your Spirit which is virginity,

26:23.680 --> 26:26.800
you have lost your, lost the sense of joy also.

26:27.080 --> 26:31.080
You are joy killers, morning till evening you are killing each other’s joy -

26:31.280 --> 26:35.240
to say harsh things, you see, from this tongue.

26:35.560 --> 26:39.720
I was folding My hands before you because I knew it would little bit upset you,

26:40.000 --> 26:44.240
so I was just keeping it there, that your mind should not be disturbed so much.

26:44.400 --> 26:49.400
In My palms, you see, very carefully I was catching your heart

26:49.600 --> 26:53.360
to keep it there, so that you should not feel hurt.

26:53.560 --> 26:59.120
Because it was not harsh, but it was truth which was harsh.

27:00.320 --> 27:05.480
But still, in My Palms I was holding it, carefully,

27:05.680 --> 27:10.360
so that you should not feel hurt about it.

27:12.320 --> 27:16.760
So to hurt anyone, just open your tongue and hurt anyone,

27:17.080 --> 27:19.760
one doesn't understand how many ripples of hatred

27:19.960 --> 27:22.800
you are creating within yourself.

27:23.160 --> 27:27.560
Twenty-four hours are not sufficient for Me to love people.

27:29.360 --> 27:32.240
Now, I will be sixty years of age,

27:32.400 --> 27:35.120
I don't think I have done justification to these sixty years

27:35.320 --> 27:39.560
because I have not been able to love people as much as I wanted to.

27:39.720 --> 27:43.240
The flow is so great that I, My body suffers with that flow and sometimes

27:43.480 --> 27:48.800
I curse Myself that, "Why should I carry such a load of love within Myself?"

27:49.080 --> 27:52.600
And little excitement with the puja also.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.520
You know what happens to Me, I shudder.

27:55.720 --> 28:00.520
Sometimes, you are calling Me for puja, now what will happen?

28:09.240 --> 28:12.080
Then somebody can ask a question sometimes,

28:12.280 --> 28:15.080
"Mother, did we not suck Your vibrations?"

28:15.280 --> 28:17.720
Is obvious, but I don't want to say that.

28:18.040 --> 28:22.000
Because if I say that, your Vishuddhi will be caught up.

28:22.200 --> 28:26.560
Again you will suck less.

28:29.720 --> 28:32.880
It's a very delicate work I have to do.

28:33.640 --> 28:39.080
You are already wounded people,

28:39.240 --> 28:43.480
because you have wounded yourself. Nobody has done this harm to you,

28:43.640 --> 28:48.120
you people have nicely wounded yourself, very nicely.

28:48.320 --> 28:53.040
Every way possible you have tried to hurt yourself.

28:53.200 --> 28:55.400
Now because of the hurt, the guilt is built-in

28:55.600 --> 29:00.560
and you are hurting others. It is as simple as that.

29:00.720 --> 29:06.200
So don't hurt yourself, there is no need to hurt yourself.

29:06.360 --> 29:11.080
But remember that we have no business to be harsh to anyone.

29:11.280 --> 29:19.800
We have to be sweet people. We have to be kind people.

29:21.040 --> 29:25.400
There are also psychologists who have come forward to give you explanation

29:25.600 --> 29:28.600
for your harshness, that, "Your will-power should be strong.

29:28.760 --> 29:31.160
If you don't talk like that others will take advantage."

29:31.320 --> 29:36.800
Who can take advantage of the western people?

29:38.040 --> 29:41.560
It is absurd, absolutely absurd!

29:41.720 --> 29:45.400
The ones who have done injustice all over the world should say such a thing,

29:45.600 --> 29:51.160
it's absurd, I cannot understand how can they give an explanation like that!

29:57.040 --> 30:01.000
But now the time has come.

30:01.120 --> 30:09.360
You are the people who are going to change the mind of God

30:11.520 --> 30:15.000
with your good behavior.

30:15.560 --> 30:20.000
The wrathful God, you are going to please Him.

30:20.160 --> 30:26.160
You are going to represent that area which sucks in the compassion of God.

30:26.320 --> 30:31.080
Ask for His compassion! Do you deserve it?

30:31.720 --> 30:33.560
If you don't deserve it,

30:33.720 --> 30:39.600
who is going to deserve it in this western world - you tell Me - today?

30:41.280 --> 30:48.000
You are the ones chosen for this, specially prepared for this, to create an area

30:48.160 --> 30:59.400
so that the deity of compassion should be awakened, for the rest of them.

31:01.800 --> 31:06.400
The arrogance, you have seen in the spread of Sahaja Yoga, what happened:

31:06.600 --> 31:10.720
we had a program where we had, say, a thousand people.

31:11.000 --> 31:17.320
For the next follow up there are only three. It's typical.

31:20.800 --> 31:28.520
I have spent most of My precious time in this country, and in the West.

31:30.800 --> 31:39.040
Despite that, the arrogance sometimes baffles Me.

31:39.640 --> 31:44.080
Arrogance among each other, even towards Me sometimes they are so arrogant,

31:44.280 --> 31:49.080
I cannot think of anyone being that arrogant to Me, as the way they are.

31:49.280 --> 31:52.160
The way they talk to Me, the way they behave towards Me,

31:52.320 --> 31:55.800
I just can't understand how can they be like that.

32:01.800 --> 32:09.040
It can be anyway, anywhere, anytime, especially women.

32:09.200 --> 32:12.760
I was amazed, I went to Belgium, and I found

32:13.080 --> 32:17.400
that Belgian housewives were even worse than Indian… than British housewives.

32:17.600 --> 32:23.720
Ah! Terrific, terrific women! Ah! Just horrible!

32:24.000 --> 32:28.320
Absolutely. You just don't know how to deal with them, it's terrific!

32:28.480 --> 32:31.720
They control the whole household into their hands, I don't know how.

32:32.040 --> 32:36.560
Only, I don't know how they do it. There's no ... (interruption in recording).

32:37.680 --> 32:41.400
So ego-oriented, I am amazed!

32:41.600 --> 32:48.200
But if you go to America, American women are baba, they are Amazonic!

32:49.000 --> 32:55.680
Horrible! You just can't understand, there's no love, no affection, nothing.

32:56.000 --> 32:59.600
Showing off, all the time talking about their material things,

32:59.760 --> 33:03.680
absolutely dry sticks, I tell you. And they want Realization,

33:04.000 --> 33:09.320
and they want to be great, and this and that. I don't know. What are they?

33:13.640 --> 33:17.560
Today it's especially the day of virginity.

33:18.760 --> 33:31.320
I have really great hopes from the women of this country, especially.

33:31.480 --> 33:35.040
Here the men don't talk at all, you see, the pattern was worst in Belgium,

33:35.200 --> 33:41.200
no man would talk a word. They cannot talk, just poor things are just shut.

33:41.360 --> 33:45.240
They don't talk, strangled, completely strangled by women,

33:45.400 --> 33:52.240
believe Me. Horrible! What is going to happen to that country, you see,

33:52.400 --> 34:00.200
where men can't talk and women talk? It's horrifying, let us face it up.

34:00.520 --> 34:02.680
What have they achieved, the women there?

34:03.000 --> 34:06.720
At least, in India, our Prime Minister is a woman.

34:07.040 --> 34:11.680
What are they? Good for nothing, useless, just washing utensils in the house

34:12.000 --> 34:15.640
and showing off. I just don't understand.

34:15.800 --> 34:18.080
What sacrifices they can go up to?

34:18.240 --> 34:22.080
The woman is known by the amount of sacrifices she makes.

34:22.280 --> 34:27.280
It's a challenge, I tell you, for all of you women who are Realized Souls

34:27.480 --> 34:32.520
to see to it, that you humble down yourself.

34:32.720 --> 34:35.560
Your quality cannot improve unless and until you humble down.

34:35.760 --> 34:39.800
On everything you assert. For what?

34:43.080 --> 34:53.000
It's impossible to worship Virgin when we are so arrogant and so strangling type.

34:53.520 --> 35:01.320
The Virgin is a simple woman. She's extremely simple.

35:02.080 --> 35:10.480
She doesn't understand what are your plans and what is so important, everything.

35:10.680 --> 35:13.240
Her importance is Her virginity, that She knows,

35:13.400 --> 35:16.720
and She will not allow anybody to touch [it?].

35:19.760 --> 35:24.480
That's Her property, that's Her wealth, that's Her greatness.

35:30.280 --> 35:33.800
And She's humble because She's not afraid of anyone.

35:34.040 --> 35:36.600
She's not aggressive.

35:38.560 --> 35:44.080
But She doesn't allow anybody to aggress; nobody dare aggress a real Virgin.

35:53.360 --> 35:58.120
A new page has been turned now, in Sahaja Yoga.

35:59.800 --> 36:03.760
I must warn you all about it.

36:04.080 --> 36:08.560
Don't take liberties too much with Sahaja Yoga.

36:09.480 --> 36:15.000
You are not obliging anyone else but yourself, be careful.

36:16.760 --> 36:21.000
Take up My warnings always seriously.

36:22.080 --> 36:26.360
You all have to come up very well now.

36:30.000 --> 36:34.360
It is not only doing My puja is going to help you, I can tell you this much.

36:34.560 --> 36:38.320
Now you better worship yourself.

36:38.520 --> 36:44.320
You have to worship all your Gods within you. Cleanse them.

36:45.080 --> 36:51.160
First is the God and the Goddess of humility,

36:51.320 --> 36:55.480
of innocence, of simplicity.

37:01.640 --> 37:04.400
Worship that.

37:05.480 --> 37:09.680
Unless and until you can worship that,

37:10.080 --> 37:13.680
you cannot go further, you will not be protected.

37:14.000 --> 37:19.320
Again I say that a new page has been turned.

37:19.520 --> 37:23.320
Don't take liberties with Sahaja Yoga.

37:23.480 --> 37:30.760
It has bestowed all the blessings upon you. You have seen the light of the day.

37:33.200 --> 37:36.800
But be prepared for the night.

37:38.080 --> 37:46.360
Nobody should try to take liberties. Try to improve yourself.

37:49.320 --> 37:52.640
No more complaints.

37:54.200 --> 37:59.320
If you can't live in an Ashram like that, you better get out of it.

38:01.040 --> 38:07.080
It's not for your convenience. Nobody is in need of you. Take it from Me.

38:07.280 --> 38:12.200
Nobody is in need of you, you have to be in need of your Self.

38:12.360 --> 38:16.400
If you are seekers, if you want to find your roots,

38:16.600 --> 38:20.320
everything is available for you.

38:20.720 --> 38:31.600
But you have to be humble, to go down to the roots, not with arrogance.

38:33.480 --> 38:38.000
We must understand why we are not progressing.

38:46.760 --> 38:56.280
Actually arrogance comes to people who lack Self-confidence.

38:58.000 --> 39:05.360
Self-confidence is shattered to people whose Self is not manifesting.

39:06.240 --> 39:09.400
Let your Self manifest.

39:10.320 --> 39:14.320
When the Self is not manifesting, you get all kinds of problems,

39:14.480 --> 39:19.400
and then you complain. Actually the problem resides within you.

39:22.000 --> 39:26.080
It is God who has to complain.

39:27.240 --> 39:32.000
Think of it. The One who has created this universe,

39:32.160 --> 39:37.520
the One who has created you all with such love and affection,

39:37.720 --> 39:41.760
the One who has given you everything under the sun,

39:42.080 --> 39:47.160
also the One who has given you Realization, given you light;

39:47.320 --> 39:57.360
everything that is possible and you are complaining against Him?

40:02.160 --> 40:07.120
You should not. Complain about yourself,

40:07.320 --> 40:13.720
that, "I am not all right, I should be all right."

40:14.000 --> 40:17.720
Complain about it, face yourself.

40:19.200 --> 40:23.360
Like children, when they face the mirror, they say,

40:23.560 --> 40:27.040
"This is somebody else." But we believe.

40:27.200 --> 40:32.400
They never identify themselves with their own images that they see.

40:32.600 --> 40:37.320
They are identified with the image that they 'are'.

40:37.480 --> 40:41.480
They don't create artificial images or don't dwell with the images

40:41.680 --> 40:49.640
which are making them feel ego-oriented.

40:51.320 --> 40:57.480
They live with reality as it is. We are made like that.

40:57.680 --> 41:09.280
You see a camera, if it takes some photograph under a light

41:10.480 --> 41:19.200
which is not, maybe, some other color, the photograph could be different.

41:19.720 --> 41:26.320
Supposing, I am wearing a red thing and supposing, you put a light that is blue,

41:26.520 --> 41:30.040
this might start looking green.

41:31.080 --> 41:36.000
But human eyes will see always the same thing.

41:37.200 --> 41:41.600
It won't see something unreal. Camera can do all that.

41:41.760 --> 41:46.160
Camera can remove somebody's head and put somebody's head there.

41:46.320 --> 41:51.000
All these tricks are possible with camera but not with human eyes.

41:51.160 --> 41:53.120
Whatever you see is the thing that.

41:53.320 --> 41:55.800
Of course, [if] you are drunk, then [it's] different.

41:56.080 --> 41:59.680
I mean, I am not... I am saying of normal conditions, you see.

42:00.000 --> 42:05.320
In normal condition, you see what exactly exists.

42:07.680 --> 42:13.480
But if you are ego-oriented, you will never see yourself what exists.

42:13.640 --> 42:18.400
You will see some sort of a bloated, you see, you will think yourself to the,

42:18.640 --> 42:22.760
be the King of God's Heavens, you see.

42:23.080 --> 42:27.400
You can see, if you want to; is imagination.

42:27.600 --> 42:31.720
If you put your imagination like that, you can see yourself as anything!

42:32.040 --> 42:35.160
Which is false, is absolute false!

42:35.320 --> 42:46.240
You are your Self and you must see yourself as your Self, as your Spirit.

42:46.480 --> 42:57.000
And Spirit is the universal being, is the innocence, is the Virgin within you.

42:57.480 --> 43:02.600
Respect it, respect that part of yours which is the Virgin - still exists -

43:02.760 --> 43:07.280
because if it was not there, I could never have given you Realization.

43:07.480 --> 43:11.720
Despite every attack, it existed there, be sure on that point.

43:12.000 --> 43:17.080
If it had not existed, you could not have got your Realization.

43:17.280 --> 43:19.080
So many of them, they are very proud,

43:19.240 --> 43:23.360
"Oh! I don't feel anything, Mother, you know, it's nothing."

43:23.760 --> 43:28.000
Then there is to be, more to be ashamed!

43:30.280 --> 43:33.760
Or at least you feel that you are missing something, isn't it?

43:34.080 --> 43:36.120
At least, you should feel that you are missing,

43:36.320 --> 43:39.480
if something is not all right and you should be all right.

43:39.680 --> 43:42.240
At least think like that, "I should be all right, I am not all right."

43:42.400 --> 43:48.200
On the contrary, "No, no, I didn't feel. Oh, what, I didn't feel, I should feel."

43:52.480 --> 44:03.240
So the wisdom. Wisdom is the part that is innocence. It's complete wisdom.

44:04.800 --> 44:09.720
You find this among the villagers or very simple people.

44:10.040 --> 44:14.320
They are not cunning in any way. You try to befool them and you'll be amazed,

44:14.520 --> 44:18.600
at the end of it you'll find, "I'm such a big mad fat fool myself."

44:18.760 --> 44:22.320
Try that with some rustic people, who are very simple, matter of fact,

44:22.480 --> 44:24.680
who live with the Mother soil.

44:25.000 --> 44:30.000
You will find that all those so-called intellectuals,

44:31.080 --> 44:35.080
if they try to befool a simple man like that,

44:35.280 --> 44:42.800
after half-an-hour, this educated and very M.A.D., Ph. D. style

44:43.080 --> 44:51.480
will find that he is 'the biggest fool ever born'.

44:57.520 --> 45:05.160
There is a saying in Sanskrit, which is very common: "Vidya vinaye na shobhate."

45:05.320 --> 45:12.520
That is Vidya, even the knowledge, is decorated.

45:12.720 --> 45:16.320
Shobhate means gets its decorations or...

45:16.480 --> 45:19.160
What is shobha? Sahaja Yogi: Glory. Shri Mataji: Beautified.

45:19.320 --> 45:24.000
Sahaja Yogi: Beauty.Yes. Shri Mataji: ...is beautified only through humility.

45:29.160 --> 45:34.080
If there is an educated man, he has to be a humble person.

45:34.280 --> 45:40.240
If he is not a humble person, then he is not educated at all, in any way.

45:42.040 --> 45:44.600
I don't know if I have told you a story

45:44.760 --> 45:57.640
about one saint was meditating and was blind.

46:00.760 --> 46:07.600
And a king came there and asked him, "Did you see some people around?"

46:07.760 --> 46:13.800
He said, "Yes. Yes, king, my king. Sit down.

46:14.080 --> 46:20.520
I saw your servant coming, and then your minister came in,

46:20.720 --> 46:26.160
and then the Prime minister came in, and then now you have come".

46:27.360 --> 46:30.760
He said, "You are blind, how did you know?

46:31.080 --> 46:34.480
Through your meditation?" He said, "No. Common sense".

46:34.680 --> 46:43.320
He said, "What is the common sense?" He said, "The first, the servant came in.

46:43.480 --> 46:50.480
He said, "What, you are bogus fellow sitting down here, wasting your time?"

46:50.800 --> 46:55.000
He gave me two-three abuses, used bad language,

46:55.160 --> 47:03.000
and said, "Have you seen any person here?" So I said, "No."

47:03.520 --> 47:13.040
Then the minister came in. He didn't abuse me, but he just asked me.

47:14.000 --> 47:17.640
Then the Prime minister came.

47:17.800 --> 47:24.200
He said, "Sir" to me. - Must have been from England.

47:28.320 --> 47:32.760
And might have said also "Thank you", perhaps -

47:40.560 --> 47:46.080
"And then came the king." And he (the saint) said that,

47:46.240 --> 47:50.520
"You were extremely humble. You first touched my feet,

47:50.720 --> 48:02.320
you sat down on the Mother Earth, waited for me to ask you,

48:02.680 --> 48:09.200
"What do you want?" And in a very humble way you said,

48:09.680 --> 48:17.080
"If you have heard of people around you" -

48:17.280 --> 48:27.320
because I am blind, so you didn't say something that would hurt me,

48:27.480 --> 48:31.480
in such a humble way - if I could tell you.

48:31.680 --> 48:39.040
But at least hundred and eight names of the Guru you took, before you asked me this.

48:39.200 --> 48:47.000
So I know you are the learned, you are the humblest, and so you must be the king."

48:47.160 --> 48:53.480
Otherwise, in those days, at least we never had kings or Prime ministers

48:54.320 --> 49:00.320
who were box-office actors.

49:08.080 --> 49:15.720
Even the public was so innocent that they would not accept such nonsense, you see.

49:16.000 --> 49:19.320
So this was the difference.

49:19.480 --> 49:32.240
From this story we have to derive that the more we are learned into Vidya,

49:32.400 --> 49:40.800
into the technique of Sahaja Yoga, we have to be humble.

49:41.080 --> 49:48.320
That is our decoration, that is our certificate,

49:48.520 --> 49:58.000
that is the path into the entrance of every human being,

49:59.360 --> 50:08.080
that is the way we are going to be very close to the other seekers.

50:08.280 --> 50:15.320
To be humble, to find out ways and methods of being humble.

50:19.320 --> 50:32.800
This is the key of Nirmala Vidya, how to be humble.

50:35.280 --> 50:43.640
By humility you will not ever say, "This is my bathroom",

50:43.800 --> 50:48.480
or "This is my fruit", or "This is my food",

50:48.680 --> 50:54.320
or "This is my table", and "This is my glass".

50:57.080 --> 51:06.560
Innocence gives you the strength to enjoy

51:09.200 --> 51:14.560
everything that is there. I mean, for Me, sometimes I have to eat with bhoots,

51:14.720 --> 51:18.720
and sometimes I have to eat bhoots.

51:19.320 --> 51:27.560
Not only eat with them, but also eat them - it's the worst part.

51:32.800 --> 51:39.640
So, you also should not mind if there are people with bhoots.

51:39.800 --> 51:47.080
If they are arrogant, try to give them bandhans

51:47.240 --> 51:51.320
try to control them through all these methods.

51:51.480 --> 51:55.600
But if you think by arguing with them you will be able to manage them,

51:55.760 --> 52:05.320
it's an impossibility. So try Nirmala Vidya, and that is humility,

52:06.200 --> 52:11.760
which is the myelin sheath of vibrations.

52:12.080 --> 52:15.000
Like every nerve has a myelin sheath covering it,

52:15.160 --> 52:20.520
in the same way is the humility, is the myelin sheath.

52:20.720 --> 52:27.320
If you are humble, you will win the battle, if you are not, we'll be lost.

52:29.000 --> 52:34.720
Then the whole thing will become a joke for you, absolute joke.

52:35.040 --> 52:41.240
If you are humble, you can see the stupid, the bhoots

52:41.400 --> 52:48.520
and all the arrogant as clowns of this drama.

52:49.560 --> 52:57.760
Try to be humble with your Self, and with Me. With Me is very important.

52:58.080 --> 53:02.720
You must understand that it is one of the conditions

53:03.040 --> 53:10.360
that Christ has put on you, so be careful. Dealing with Me,

53:10.560 --> 53:17.080
I don't want you to be in any way rude to Me, because I can't help it there.

53:17.320 --> 53:21.320
Till you are humble with Me, everything is in My charge.

53:21.480 --> 53:27.680
But as soon as you are rude to Me, somebody else and so many of them,

53:28.000 --> 53:33.760
thousands of them take charge, and then don't blame Me for that,

53:34.080 --> 53:41.000
because you are My protégés, you are under My protection.

53:41.160 --> 53:45.400
Supposing you try to make holes in your roof,

53:45.600 --> 53:50.360
and then say that the rain is coming in. What can you do about it?

53:50.560 --> 53:53.720
I mean, the hole... you have already made the holes in your roof.

53:54.000 --> 53:59.080
The roof that was to protect you, you have made holes, now the rain has to come in.

53:59.280 --> 54:03.680
Then if you want that the roof still should protect you from the rain,

54:04.000 --> 54:11.520
then I must say you lack intelligence. That's what it is.

54:11.720 --> 54:16.480
So this is the another warning.

54:16.680 --> 54:24.520
It's very embarrassing, but again today is the day of embarrassment as it is.

54:24.720 --> 54:29.240
Because the Virgin is in embarrassed condition always,

54:29.400 --> 54:33.680
She is a bashful personality. She has to be bashful, you see.

54:34.000 --> 54:41.080
She is embarrassed to say things which She does not want to say.

54:41.240 --> 54:43.800
Of course, that's a very sweet thing,

54:44.080 --> 54:49.080
even there She is bashful, to say harsh thing is a horrible stuff.

54:49.240 --> 54:59.200
So let us worship our virginity within ourselves. Let us rise up to that point

55:00.480 --> 55:10.640
to mount that diamond of brilliance of our virginity,

55:11.760 --> 55:17.000
in the setting of our humility.

55:19.680 --> 55:27.480
You can be angry with others, not with Sahaja Yogis, not with Me.

55:28.040 --> 55:33.760
Even with others, when it is absolutely required.

55:35.680 --> 55:40.000
But if you fight among yourselves, and tell people about Sahaja Yoga,

55:40.120 --> 55:43.080
nobody is going to believe you.

55:45.600 --> 55:49.080
And that is why today is the day

55:49.280 --> 55:59.000
when the Virgin Gauri sat down to worship Shiva.

55:59.760 --> 56:06.280
She made a Shiva Linga and was sitting and putting Her sindur on that,

56:06.720 --> 56:12.720
"That you look after this, which is the mark of My union with You.

56:13.000 --> 56:19.000
I leave it to You to look after, to Shiva. You look after this.

56:19.160 --> 56:25.120
I surrender to You." For this, that’s how the Gauri,

56:25.320 --> 56:30.600
your Kundalini, surrenders to the Spirit. "Now you look after this connection.

56:30.760 --> 56:35.800
I forget everything else. I leave it into Your hands. Lift me up.

56:36.080 --> 56:41.640
You raise me up. I forget all that was me before.

56:41.800 --> 56:45.640
Everything I have dropped out. No other desire.

56:45.800 --> 56:51.000
But just lift me higher and higher. Make me Yourself.

56:51.160 --> 56:56.080
The rest of it is not important. All other manifestations of these desires are over.

56:56.240 --> 57:00.240
Now, I am absolutely surrendered to You, my Spirit.

57:00.400 --> 57:05.480
Lift me higher and higher. Higher and higher,

57:05.680 --> 57:13.160
away from all the things that were not the Spirit.

57:14.640 --> 57:20.800
Make me complete Spirit, full Spirit."

57:21.080 --> 57:25.040
Forget all that was there.

57:25.520 --> 57:34.040
That elevation, that ascent

57:34.520 --> 57:46.080
becomes a fast, quick trip, a very fast ascent.

57:46.280 --> 57:52.760
Just you can do it if you try at this moment and every moment

57:53.040 --> 57:59.120
to give up all that was not the Spirit.

57:59.320 --> 58:03.320
Anything that goes against the Spirit must be given up.

58:03.480 --> 58:07.600
And that is what is the pure desire,

58:07.760 --> 58:11.720
that's what it is the Kundalini, is the Virgin.

58:12.040 --> 58:16.080
Is to be absolutely one with the Spirit.

58:16.240 --> 58:26.240
All the rest has no meaning, has no value.

58:29.160 --> 58:34.080
This ascent - whatever may be your position,

58:34.240 --> 58:37.800
to whomsoever you may be married, wherever you are working,

58:38.080 --> 58:41.680
whatever is your situation, whatever may be your country,

58:42.000 --> 58:49.320
you are the Spirit. And if you are raised aloft,

58:49.480 --> 59:01.400
you will dwell in the beautiful kingdom of God, where all ugliness drops out.

59:01.600 --> 59:09.760
Like when the lotus opens out, all the mud drops out, completely.

59:10.080 --> 59:15.360
In the same way, let My children become the fragrant,

59:15.560 --> 59:20.040
beautiful offerings of Sadashiva.

59:20.200 --> 59:23.680
May God bless you.
