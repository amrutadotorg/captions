01:52.827 --> 01:57.806
the living waters, yet You are
so much more than this.

01:57.831 --> 02:02.970

Shri Ganesha, Your first creation,
resonates

03:27.213 --> 03:30.703
in the carbon atom, the essence
of life.

03:30.728 --> 03:38.137

SHRI ADI SHAKTI NAMO NAMAH

04:33.914 --> 04:38.045
The simplest flower has
its fraction of You,

04:38.070 --> 04:42.142
the grandest tree has
its share as well.

04:42.167 --> 04:46.568
SHRI ADI SHAKTI NAMO NAMAH

04:46.593 --> 04:49.728
All nature’s creatures are Yours,

04:49.753 --> 04:53.514
from the beauty of Mother Earth’s
green sari

are loved by You.

05:39.570 --> 05:44.866
SHRI ADI SHAKTI NAMO NAMAH

05:48.826 --> 05:51.951
Shri Adi Shakti, the land
of Vishuddhi

05:51.976 --> 05:55.613
is one aspect of Your vast
creation.

06:05.944 --> 06:11.504
The native peoples of America worshipped
Adi Shakti as the Great Mother

06:11.529 --> 06:14.825
and they respected the land
as sacred.

06:14.850 --> 06:18.759
May this attitude return to all others
who live here

06:18.784 --> 06:21.512
and enjoy the land’s bounty.

You came, Shri Adi Shakti,
as Surabhi, the divine cow

07:12.547 --> 07:17.331
emerging from the Vishnuloka
at Gokul,

07:17.356 --> 07:20.568
where Shri Krishna had
His childhood.

07:20.593 --> 07:25.607
SHRI ADI SHAKTI NAMO NAMAH

07:25.632 --> 07:31.010
Shri Adi Shakti, let the feminine

07:37.459 --> 07:42.433
SHRI ADI SHAKTI NAMO NAMAH

07:42.458 --> 07:47.646
You give to women the regal gentleness
of Shalinata

07:47.671 --> 07:53.408
to care for their families and to be
the preservers of society.

07:53.433 --> 07:58.699
SHRI ADI SHAKTI NAMO NAMAH

07:58.724 --> 08:03.823
Your quality of Sharada-devi gives
authority over the truth,

art, music and drama.

08:07.257 --> 08:11.709
SHRI ADI SHAKTI NAMO NAMAH

08:11.734 --> 08:15.065
You also came as Sati-devi,

08:15.090 --> 08:19.979
establishing a royal dharma
to which we aspire.

08:20.004 --> 08:25.237

poets and saints.

08:33.821 --> 08:38.534
SHRI ADI SHAKTI NAMO NAMAH

08:38.559 --> 08:44.377
Shri Adi Shakti, to describe You
is the work of poets and saints,

08:44.402 --> 08:49.443
who awkwardly tried to embrace
a mystery on the horizon.

08:49.468 --> 08:54.221
SHRI ADI SHAKTI NAMO NAMAH

08:54.246 --> 08:59.770
You are Para-shakti, the power
beyond all powers.

08:59.795 --> 09:04.367
SHRI ADI SHAKTI NAMO NAMAH

09:04.392 --> 09:08.892
Give us, O Adi Shakti,
greater humility

09:08.917 --> 09:13.853
so that we can gain some small
glimpse of Your glory.

09:13.878 --> 09:17.242
SHRI ADI SHAKTI NAMO NAMAH

09:17.267 --> 09:23.934
Make us like the Sufis and the Gnostics
adoring You at every moment.

09:23.959 --> 09:29.540
SHRI ADI SHAKTI NAMO NAMAH

09:29.565 --> 09:34.006
Your power of Mahalakshmi bridges

10:17.802 --> 10:21.591
You created the pithas,
the chakras,

10:21.616 --> 10:26.386
nature and humanity, and its subtle
workings.

10:26.411 --> 10:32.164
May the complexity of Your work
humble us down completely.

10:32.189 --> 10:37.063
SHRI ADI SHAKTI NAMO NAMAH

10:37.088 --> 10:42.965

vibrations.

11:11.137 --> 11:15.951
SHRI ADI SHAKTI NAMO NAMAH

11:15.976 --> 11:20.953
Your Mahamaya swarupa allows us
to be near You

11:20.978 --> 11:26.931
and it shields us from the awesome
might that flows from You.

11:26.956 --> 11:31.474
SHRI ADI SHAKTI NAMO NAMAH

11:31.499 --> 11:37.495
Shri Adi Shakti, please give us deeper
powers of introspection,

so that we become self-cleansing
and self-aware.

11:42.672 --> 11:47.296
SHRI ADI SHAKTI NAMO NAMAH

11:47.321 --> 11:50.681
You are the Mother who desired

12:17.627 --> 12:21.988
SHRI ADI SHAKTI NAMO NAMAH

12:22.013 --> 12:26.773
Through maya, humanity forgets
the principles of life.

12:26.798 --> 12:30.313
Through Sahaja Yoga, humanity
now remembers

12:30.338 --> 12:34.919
and absorbs the vibrations
of Shri Adi Shakti.

12:34.944 --> 12:39.192
SHRI ADI SHAKTI NAMO NAMAH

12:39.217 --> 12:43.033

You have incarnated on this Earth
for the Last Judgement.

and the Torsion area.

13:24.246 --> 13:29.163
SHRI ADI SHAKTI NAMO NAMAH

13:29.188 --> 13:35.688
Whatever human beings plan, You
dismantle it to destroy their egos.

With one subtle movement of Your finger,
You destroy people like Hitler.

You expose the falsehood
in very direct ways.

14:25.584 --> 14:30.172
SHRI ADI SHAKTI NAMO NAMAH

14:30.197 --> 14:37.812
You do not know any fear and You give
complete security to all sahaja yogis.

14:37.837 --> 14:42.036
SHRI ADI SHAKTI NAMO NAMAH

14:42.061 --> 14:45.489
You respect Your children
and love them

14:45.514 --> 14:49.761
to make them perfect models
for the rest of humanity.
