The mystery of living processes

and cannot be duplicated by any
personality.

00:06:34.658 --> 00:06:37.878
Let humanity be aware of this.

00:06:37.903 --> 00:06:43.006

SHRI ADI SHAKTI NAMO NAMAH

00:08:38.559 --> 00:08:44.377
Shri Adi Shakti, to describe You
is the work of poets and saints,

00:08:44.402 --> 00:08:49.443
who awkwardly tried to embrace
a mystery on the horizon.

00:08:49.468 --> 00:08:54.221

SHRI ADI SHAKTI NAMO NAMAH

00:11:15.976 --> 00:11:20.953
Your Mahamaya swarupa allows us
to be near You

00:11:20.978 --> 00:11:26.931
and it shields us from the awesome
might that flows from You.

00:11:26.956 --> 00:11:31.474

SHRI ADI SHAKTI NAMO NAMAH

00:12:22.013 --> 00:12:26.773
Through maya, humanity forgets
the principles of life.

00:12:26.798 --> 00:12:30.313
Through Sahaja Yoga, humanity
now remembers

00:12:30.338 --> 00:12:34.919

of Shri Adi Shakti.
