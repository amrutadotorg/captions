00:00:07.667 --> 00:00:11.785
Happy Easter to you all.

00:00:13.285 --> 00:00:18.795
So we celebrate Easter

00:00:18.996 --> 00:00:24.709
to show how Christ resurrected, resurrected Himself.

00:00:25.485 --> 00:00:32.223
The spirit that is Christ has to resurrect

00:00:32.423 --> 00:00:45.421
out of the material manifestation of the divine itself.

00:00:45.622 --> 00:00:53.555
The matter is manifested,

00:00:53.755 --> 00:01:03.429
because we ourselves have created it.

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:12.401
Not that we are born out of matter, our body,

00:01:12.601 --> 00:01:18.921
but we are attached to it, we want it, we want to have it.

00:01:20.242 --> 00:01:28.796
Whatever you want, that sustains itself by your desire,

00:01:28.996 --> 00:01:33.306
because now you are on the stage.

00:01:33.506 --> 00:01:37.392
If you want to sustain the matter,

00:01:37.592 --> 00:01:43.442
if you want to keep the matter as the first priority,

00:01:43.642 --> 00:01:47.861
it will remain.

00:01:48.611 --> 00:01:51.867
It cannot disappear.

00:01:52.067 --> 00:01:56.046
It has to go out of your mind,

00:01:56.246 --> 00:02:00.788
that matter cannot hold you any further.

00:02:00.988 --> 00:02:07.463
Christ rose out of the matter, came out of the tomb which symbolises the matter

00:02:07.663 --> 00:02:12.666
which has enclosed us within,

00:02:12.866 --> 00:02:18.013
which has to be opened out with our spiritual power.

00:02:18.213 --> 00:02:22.541
Throw away, throw away the stone that is covering this grave.

00:02:22.742 --> 00:02:32.333
Get out of that and stand outside it.

00:02:33.833 --> 00:02:37.783
This is the message of Christ’s resurrection.

00:02:37.984 --> 00:02:44.753
The tomb that we have created, we have created ourselves,

00:02:44.954 --> 00:02:53.372
because we have allowed people to dominate us.

00:02:54.622 --> 00:03:02.011
We have allowed them to make these graves for us,

00:03:02.211 --> 00:03:10.459
we have allowed them to bury Christ within ourselves,

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:15.698
because we were afraid.

00:03:19.272 --> 00:03:24.952
But Christ has to rise.

00:03:25.522 --> 00:03:30.270
So we create our own matter through our conditionings,

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:36.255
through our fears, through our absolute wrong ideas

00:03:36.455 --> 00:03:42.239
about goodness and kindness and compassion.

00:03:43.246 --> 00:03:47.375
In the light of the Spirit, you can see what we think as compassion

00:03:47.575 --> 00:03:57.710
is nothing but a kind of sympathy which leads you nowhere.

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:05.318
But one should learn to see everything in the light of the Spirit.

00:04:05.518 --> 00:04:11.158
But do we use all the time the light of the Spirit? We do not.

00:04:11.358 --> 00:04:18.201
For Christ, it was not difficult, because He was the Spirit.

00:04:18.626 --> 00:04:22.278
But He has shown you the way.

00:04:22.478 --> 00:04:27.918
He crucified Himself to show you the way.

00:04:28.118 --> 00:04:34.726
All the ideas about sophistication,

00:04:34.926 --> 00:04:41.659
about our standing in the society,

00:04:41.859 --> 00:04:48.756
how we relate ourselves to other dignitaries or to our country,

00:04:48.956 --> 00:04:56.310
to our politics, to our economics and the world at large,

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:02.396
all of them can tie us down to that tomb.

00:05:03.193 --> 00:05:07.376
You belong to another category, I’ve told you a hundred times.

00:05:07.576 --> 00:05:12.316
And a category which is the Spirit,

00:05:12.516 --> 00:05:19.944
which can rise above all the tombs, can throw away everything.

00:05:20.144 --> 00:05:23.198
This way you are conditioned.

00:05:23.265 --> 00:05:26.472
All these ideas are to be seen

00:05:26.672 --> 00:05:31.698
with a new dimension of awareness that you have.

00:05:31.898 --> 00:05:36.710
You are the Spirit.

00:05:39.285 --> 00:05:43.168
Why should you worry about anything else

00:05:43.369 --> 00:05:46.322
but your vibrations?

00:05:46.523 --> 00:05:48.519
Because you are saints.

00:05:48.719 --> 00:05:53.842
You should just worry about the comfort of your Spirit.

00:05:54.042 --> 00:05:58.896
Whatever is congenial to your Spirit, just go on doing that,

00:05:59.096 --> 00:06:04.032
observing that, accumulating that and sucking within yourself.

00:06:04.232 --> 00:06:06.263
All conditionings will run away.

00:06:06.464 --> 00:06:08.464
Because these conditionings you accept,

00:06:08.665 --> 00:06:14.706
because they look comfortable, they look comfortable, but they are not.

00:06:19.086 --> 00:06:23.077
Christ is a great example and if He is the one whom you follow,

00:06:23.277 --> 00:06:26.983
if He is the one you have understood and recognised

00:06:27.183 --> 00:06:29.569
in the light of your Spirit,

00:06:29.769 --> 00:06:33.978
then you must know why did He go into the grave first of all.

00:06:34.178 --> 00:06:36.509
The Man who was so powerful,

00:06:36.709 --> 00:06:43.294
Who when He will come He’ll reduce all of them into ashes,

00:06:43.494 --> 00:06:46.872
such a great personality like Him of Ekadasha Rudra.

00:06:47.072 --> 00:06:51.177
Why did Christ

00:06:51.377 --> 00:06:56.156
allow Himself to be crucified and to be buried into that?

00:06:56.356 --> 00:07:03.125
Because He wanted to stoop down to the level of other people,

00:07:03.325 --> 00:07:06.214
to come down to that level so that people should see that

00:07:06.414 --> 00:07:12.698
through His life, they are shown that you can be resurrected.

00:07:12.898 --> 00:07:16.069
Now the Resurrection has taken place.

00:07:16.269 --> 00:07:22.793
Sahaja Yogis are resurrected no doubt, but still one foot is in the grave.

00:07:26.124 --> 00:07:29.283
And the second one I do not know whether it will be out or in,

00:07:29.483 --> 00:07:33.912
it is just halfway through.

00:07:35.492 --> 00:07:41.917
One foot is of course outside, no doubt, but still is not yet touching the ground,

00:07:42.117 --> 00:07:45.261
and the other cannot be lifted unless you push the ground,

00:07:45.461 --> 00:07:51.471
this matter, again, to push it up.

00:07:53.385 --> 00:07:57.114
If you live with your Spirit, you should have no fears,

00:07:57.315 --> 00:07:59.171
you should have no worry.
