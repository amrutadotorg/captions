00:04.748 --> 00:08.471
It was really a wonderful idea

00:08.672 --> 00:14.809
to put My attention to all these fields
of life, which are very important

00:15.010 --> 00:23.490
and, as it is, I have attention on the all
of them, and I care for all that.

00:23.690 --> 00:29.250
But I would say now you all people put in
your attention to it,

00:29.450 --> 00:34.689
because it is you who can do something
about it.

00:34.890 --> 00:37.231
You can start with the nature, as they
said, is this:

00:37.432 --> 00:40.050
we have to be kind to the nature.

00:40.250 --> 00:43.222
We are having such problems - people
are cutting out trees,

00:43.423 --> 00:47.570
doing all these kinds of things, without
even thinking

00:47.770 --> 00:52.866
that this is for the progeny will become
a desert.

00:53.067 --> 01:00.287
So in the same way for everything,
for your fruits and agriculture,

01:00.488 --> 01:06.089
vibrations can really change. We had
in our garden, you won't believe,

01:06.290 --> 01:11.880
a peony flower just like this, even bigger
then this, very bigger.

01:12.081 --> 01:20.157
We have never seen such a flower.
We had also the tulips so big as that.

01:20.358 --> 01:23.010
I haven't seen such tulips in My lifetime.

01:23.210 --> 01:26.250
With vibrations you can improve everywhere.

01:26.490 --> 01:32.734
Say you go and see some politician,
let's say, or some political party,

01:32.935 --> 01:37.090
then you use your hands and give them
bandhans all the time.

01:37.290 --> 01:40.219
You can sit on the table across

01:40.420 --> 01:44.779
and under the table you go on giving
them bandhan.

01:46.467 --> 01:51.850
You have powers, but if you don’t use
your powers, then it is useless –

01:52.051 --> 01:55.235
if you just go on thinking about building
up yourself

01:55.436 --> 01:59.131
and looking after yourself - now those days
are gone.

01:59.332 --> 02:02.278
Now you have to look after other things,
and I was very much happy

02:02.479 --> 02:06.608
with all the things that they have shown
and all My attention is already there.

02:06.809 --> 02:08.989
But if you people also put your attention…

02:09.190 --> 02:13.891
As you know I have already purchased
seven big, big lands,

02:14.092 --> 02:17.370
about fifty to sixty acres of lands
in Maharashtra

02:17.570 --> 02:20.849
for different projects and these projects
have started.

02:21.050 --> 02:24.591
Now in Delhi also we have a very huge,
big plan

02:24.792 --> 02:28.890
to put the women who are destitutes.

02:29.090 --> 02:32.409
First, on the social level we have to do
something, I thought.

02:32.610 --> 02:36.333
So it’s all done, now we have started a
school, we have started a academy again –

02:36.534 --> 02:38.829
we are going to have another academy.

02:39.030 --> 02:44.587
And also teaching young people with
vocational knowledge and all that.

02:44.788 --> 02:50.089
India has, that way, is not so progressed
as you people are in these things.

02:50.290 --> 02:53.888
But there’s one thing very great about
India is that –

02:54.089 --> 03:01.376
because of our culture maybe, because
of our Indian style of life of respect,

03:01.577 --> 03:07.787
people have become very well equipped for
the software; you see, this kind of thing.

03:07.988 --> 03:12.369
They are very intelligent in software,
because their attention penetrates.

03:12.570 --> 03:15.649
So if you also penetrate your attention,

03:15.850 --> 03:18.982
I mean, you can achieve the same.
You are higher than them.

03:19.183 --> 03:22.223
But because they have been brought up
in that culture,

03:22.424 --> 03:29.682
they are very intelligent, but their
attention is not spread out, no.

03:29.883 --> 03:34.071
It is not. It is just on one point and they
penetrate very well.

03:34.272 --> 03:37.210
And they are doing so well now that
a day will come

03:37.410 --> 03:40.449
when India will become one of the most
prosperous country.

03:40.650 --> 03:42.948
So this is what has to happen,

03:43.149 --> 03:46.630
that, firstly, the our culture has to be
brought round

03:46.831 --> 03:51.809
to such a state that the children get
all the positive ideas

03:52.010 --> 03:56.410
and a good character and proper building:
with love, affection.

03:56.611 --> 03:59.053
But not to spoil them. Not to spoil them.

03:59.254 --> 04:02.886
They should be brought up in such
a manner, that they develop

04:03.087 --> 04:10.211
a proper view of the whole thing and also
they have penetration of their attention.

04:10.412 --> 04:15.079
But if you go on changing your attention
all the time, the inside is finished,

04:15.280 --> 04:20.969
I mean, because you see attention gets –
what you call it - broken.

04:21.170 --> 04:25.009
So this penetration of attention has to be
seen.

04:25.210 --> 04:32.730
Is, say, for example, you look at some
tree: then just watch it with love.

04:32.930 --> 04:35.629
See what the tree is talking to you,
what is she saying?

04:35.830 --> 04:39.890
You’re just looking at a mountain -
then just talk to the mountain,

04:40.090 --> 04:42.592
and see what the mountain is saying to you.

04:42.793 --> 04:48.535
Put your attention in, completely on one
thing and see for yourself,

04:48.736 --> 04:52.490
that will help you a lot. But if you have
an attention

04:52.690 --> 04:56.370
which is all the time watching this,
watching that, this, that -

04:56.570 --> 05:01.670
and criticising is another way you miss out
on attention.

05:01.871 --> 05:06.090
Lots of attention goes to this. Thirdly:
could be the,

05:06.290 --> 05:09.320
as I said, is self-importance; is the worst
thing.

05:09.521 --> 05:11.850
In that, then, you do not think anything
is important,

05:12.050 --> 05:18.813
you just go on looking after your self-
importance. There's so many ways,

05:19.014 --> 05:25.900
but the best way is to learn how to handle
your own attention,

05:26.101 --> 05:30.249
and how to handle other people.
That’s very important.

05:30.450 --> 05:34.650
How you deal with people is very important
for a sahaja yogi.

05:34.850 --> 05:39.650
You see, if you deal in a proper way,
in a decent manner,

05:39.850 --> 05:45.210
in a way that’s congenial, that’s
appreciative,

05:45.410 --> 05:49.474
then you will find so many friends, and
they will try to find out

05:49.675 --> 05:54.570
how are you like this, how are you so
peaceful, how are you so kind,

05:54.770 --> 05:57.455
why are you not agitated like others are.

05:57.656 --> 06:01.177
So in your own lifestyle you can establish
it.

06:01.378 --> 06:03.809
But when you are dealing with others,
what I am saying,

06:04.010 --> 06:08.105
that the social relations with others
is very important.

06:08.306 --> 06:10.897
Now, at what level you should start
I can’t say.

06:11.098 --> 06:14.715
Depends on your temperament and aptitude.

06:14.916 --> 06:18.450
But whichever of these areas that you think
is important,

06:18.650 --> 06:21.969
you can just try to find out what is
the solution,

06:22.170 --> 06:27.689
how can you help it here, how can you
work it out. All of you can do it.

06:27.890 --> 06:34.729
It is not that you have to develop a kind
of a party to fight anything.

06:34.930 --> 06:40.465
But to have your own attention, you will
know the solutions of many problems.

06:40.666 --> 06:45.073
Many problems can be solved if you
find out the solution.

06:45.274 --> 06:48.926
But a solution you can find with your
concentration of mind.

06:49.127 --> 06:53.650
That is very important. And if you can
really do that,

06:53.850 --> 06:59.127
all these problems that you face today,
in those different fields of life,

06:59.328 --> 07:02.781
can be easily solved. It’s not so
difficult.

07:02.982 --> 07:07.454
Family life as you said can be solved,
depending on the wife

07:07.655 --> 07:14.001
and depending on the husband and their
relationship. Is very simple it is.

07:14.669 --> 07:17.389
But somehow or other our background is
such, I think,

07:17.590 --> 07:23.170
that we don’t understand simple things.
We only understand complicated things.

07:23.370 --> 07:29.449
In a simple way, if you deal with people
at different levels

07:29.650 --> 07:35.763
in these different aspects of life,
you’ll be amazed

07:35.964 --> 07:41.966
you will be very much popular, people will
want to know what sort of a thing it is.

07:42.167 --> 07:44.966
I’ll tell you one gentleman. His name was
Mr. Dhumal.

07:45.167 --> 07:47.083
He is no more. They know him.

07:47.284 --> 07:50.295
He was in the village, he was used to –
he was looking after

07:50.496 --> 07:57.730
his fields and things, he was like
a farmer.

07:57.930 --> 08:01.090
And somehow he got realization in Poona.

08:01.291 --> 08:04.943
After getting realization in Poona he went
to his own place

08:05.144 --> 08:07.498
and he started Sahaja Yoga there.

08:07.699 --> 08:12.553
And he started giving them realization,
this and that.

08:12.754 --> 08:18.651
And it was surprising, because he never
came, as such, to Me,

08:18.852 --> 08:24.240
or he never came to Poona - and suddenly
he developed that, you see,

08:24.441 --> 08:27.371
mind of concentration.

08:27.572 --> 08:31.929
And the people told Me, “Mother, he’s got
so many sahaja yogis”.

08:32.129 --> 08:36.568
He has developed it with such
understanding,

08:36.769 --> 08:38.844
and when I went there, I was surprised

08:39.045 --> 08:42.681
that we had more sahaja yogis there
than we had in Poona!

08:42.882 --> 08:46.106
When in Poona there were sahaja yogis
who were doing the work,

08:46.307 --> 08:50.429
but this one single fellow had changed
the whole idea

08:50.630 --> 08:54.813
of people in Ahmadnagar and Rahuri.

08:55.014 --> 09:00.557
Very surprising it was, that I mean, he was
just a simple man and a farmer type,

09:00.773 --> 09:06.165
and then he started using vibrations
for his activities and things.

09:06.366 --> 09:08.905
And it was so remarkable,

09:09.106 --> 09:12.973
that actually he was, as I said, not very
educated and all that,

09:13.174 --> 09:15.705
but we always went and stayed in his house,

09:15.906 --> 09:19.022
and we were really enamoured by the way

09:19.223 --> 09:22.449
he tried to express his spirituality
to others.

09:22.650 --> 09:25.487
In the same way all of you can do it.

09:25.688 --> 09:31.809
Now what I have seen that we are very
shy – shy about Sahaja Yoga.

09:32.010 --> 09:35.133
Once I was traveling in the plane and there
was one lady

09:35.334 --> 09:40.290
sitting with her burning absolutely.
So I asked her, "Who is your guru?"

09:40.490 --> 09:45.592
And she went into another realm
of describing, “The guru is like this.”

09:45.793 --> 09:52.024
I know the guru is horrible, false –
I mean, horrible false person, horrible.

09:52.225 --> 09:56.569
But she was praising him so much.
Without knowing much about Me

09:56.770 --> 10:00.000
she was just going on and on, and I said,
“Look at this woman,

10:00.201 --> 10:03.529
how much she is talking about her guru!”

10:03.730 --> 10:07.747
And while we are little shy to talk about
Sahaja Yoga.

10:07.948 --> 10:11.123
First start talking to the trees about
Sahaja Yoga, maybe,

10:11.324 --> 10:16.419
you practice it that way – and then you
can start talking to others

10:16.620 --> 10:20.510
about Sahaja Yoga. You can work it out.
You have to do it.

10:20.711 --> 10:24.148
Anybody who meets you, should see you,
ask you.

10:24.349 --> 10:27.366
Because it will be quite evident from
your face,

10:27.567 --> 10:30.274
from your behaviour, that you are
a different person.

10:30.475 --> 10:33.729
But then you should start talking
openly about it.

10:33.930 --> 10:39.333
If I was shy like you, Sahaja Yoga would
not have spread!

10:40.127 --> 10:44.769
So there’s nothing to be shy about.
You should just know

10:44.970 --> 10:46.819
that you are Sahaja Yogis, you are
all Sufis,

10:47.020 --> 10:51.579
and you can talk to people openly, to all
the people you will be meeting.

10:51.780 --> 10:54.769
Gradually you'll be surprised that they
will see your character,

10:54.970 --> 10:58.680
they will see your nature, and change.
Like this Dhumal:

10:58.881 --> 11:03.450
once he went to an office and he had
to get some work done.

11:03.651 --> 11:05.760
And there he started telling them,
“I want to do this.”

11:05.961 --> 11:08.997
But he was so peaceful and joyful

11:09.198 --> 11:14.530
that they asked him, “From what mill
do you get your food?”

11:14.730 --> 11:20.058
You see, they couldn’t understand that
how could he be so quiet,

11:20.259 --> 11:25.492
and so honest and so very penetrating.

11:25.693 --> 11:31.449
And that gave him all the popularity
in that office.

11:31.650 --> 11:35.805
It’s a collector’s office. And so many
people came and asked him,

11:36.006 --> 11:38.965
and he told that, “I am a follower
of Shri Mataji

11:39.166 --> 11:42.780
and I’m a sahaja yogi and you all can
become sahaja yogis.”

11:42.981 --> 11:45.889
They said, “Alright, we’ll also become.”
Like that.

11:46.090 --> 11:48.747
So one should not feel shy about
Sahaja Yoga.

11:48.948 --> 11:53.330
Otherwise what happens that it melts
away with you.

11:53.530 --> 11:56.941
So this is I have been telling, and again
and again all these things

11:57.142 --> 12:00.049
that you have said is very good,
My attention is there

12:00.250 --> 12:04.350
and I’m the only woman in the whole
world must be reading all the newspapers.

12:04.551 --> 12:08.148
Normally women don’t read newspapers,
because they are headaches.

12:08.349 --> 12:14.228
But I read newspapers, and I try to follow,
and I get to the right point,

12:14.429 --> 12:18.906
and, I mean, it’s quite in My mind about
these things.

12:19.107 --> 12:23.089
But only person you see, cannot do it -
na? - alone.

12:23.290 --> 12:27.090
You have to have others, who can
channelize this.

12:27.290 --> 12:30.930
So I would say that – don’t feel shy.
You should talk about it.

12:31.130 --> 12:34.306
You wear the badge. With the badge
people will ask you a question,

12:34.507 --> 12:36.662
“Who is this one?” Then you talk to them.

12:36.863 --> 12:42.290
Any way you like you should expose yourself
and that will work out better.

12:42.497 --> 12:44.364
All these problems can be solved by you,

12:44.565 --> 12:49.327
you are quite a lot of number here, and
also representing so many behind.

12:49.528 --> 12:55.370
So you can understand what is your
personality is,

12:55.571 --> 12:59.530
and how much you can impress people.
Alright?

12:59.731 --> 13:02.301
Thank you.
