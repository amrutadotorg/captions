00:00:03.971 --> 00:00:10.599
Today we have gathered here to do
the Navaratri Puja.

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:19.063
There were nine times when the major
incarnations

00:00:19.264 --> 00:00:24.203
of the Mother of this universe

00:00:26.705 --> 00:00:32.836
were manifested. They were manifested
with a purpose.

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:43.025
That purpose is to protect Her bhaktas,
Her disciples, Her children.

00:00:43.297 --> 00:00:46.227
This was

00:00:51.069 --> 00:01:02.090
a binding love, She could not escape it.

00:01:02.291 --> 00:01:07.862
Mother's love is binding, She cannot
escape it

00:01:08.063 --> 00:01:14.188
and She has to manifest it, work it out

00:01:14.396 --> 00:01:19.470
and give that protection to all
Her children.

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.829
This protection in the modern times
has taken another form.

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:35.236
In those days, the evil was trying

00:01:35.437 --> 00:01:41.584
to harm, to destroy the people who were
righteous,

00:01:41.785 --> 00:01:45.651
who were bhaktas, who were doing
good things,

00:01:45.852 --> 00:01:51.417
who wanted to lead a very religious life.

00:01:51.618 --> 00:01:57.185
So to save them, She incarnated.
To protect them, She incarnated.

00:01:57.386 --> 00:02:01.937
But they knew what was good, they knew
what was wrong.

00:02:03.034 --> 00:02:08.596
And they wanted to preserve their good
life, their precious life.

00:02:08.797 --> 00:02:12.520
They didn't care for money, they didn't
care for power,

00:02:12.721 --> 00:02:16.462
but just they wanted their life,

00:02:16.663 --> 00:02:21.718
means they wanted to be alive to worship
the Goddess.

00:02:21.919 --> 00:02:26.267
And when they were troubled or harmed
or destroyed

00:02:26.468 --> 00:02:29.968
by these evil forces, She had to manifest.

00:02:30.169 --> 00:02:34.188
But in modern times it's become
very complicated

00:02:34.389 --> 00:02:37.826
as the modern times are complicated.

00:02:38.034 --> 00:02:40.780
First of all,

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:47.597
in the mind, in the lifestyle,
in the society

00:02:47.798 --> 00:02:54.167
of good human beings, righteous human
beings,

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:00.349
fear of the wrong has entered.

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.256
Like they are afraid say of their priests,
of their churches,

00:03:05.457 --> 00:03:09.910
of their temples, of their mosques,
which are all false.

00:03:10.111 --> 00:03:14.123
They are not afraid of God, they don't
believe in God.

00:03:14.292 --> 00:03:19.479
They think they have created God and they
can manage God. So who is God?

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.618
The way they behave you can see clearly
that they do not recognize

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:29.366
the existence of God, God Almighty who is
a wrathful God.

00:03:29.567 --> 00:03:33.327
They are not at all worried as to what
will happen to them.

00:03:33.528 --> 00:03:38.324
They don't even believe in the second life,
they don't believe in the resurrection.

00:03:38.525 --> 00:03:45.043
They are very short-sighted, evil people
doing all kinds of evil things.

00:03:45.244 --> 00:03:49.764
So somehow or other, as soon as you
are born,

00:03:49.965 --> 00:03:53.491
you are born into some sort of a brand,

00:03:53.692 --> 00:03:59.184
you are this, you are that, you are that,
you are that, as soon as you are born.

00:03:59.385 --> 00:04:02.053
So the first brand comes onto this
modern man,

00:04:02.254 --> 00:04:06.806
is of what religion to which he belongs.

00:04:07.204 --> 00:04:13.064
He can't avoid it, he has to be jolly well
belonging to some religion.

00:04:13.265 --> 00:04:16.810
You go anywhere, even in the passport -
nowadays they have stopped it -

00:04:17.011 --> 00:04:21.671
otherwise they used to ask: "What is
your religion?"

00:04:22.801 --> 00:04:28.083
And in India if you said you had no
religion they would not give you a passport

00:04:28.284 --> 00:04:31.864
because you are not yet qualified
evil person,

00:04:32.065 --> 00:04:36.425
or you are not following qualified
evil people.

00:04:36.626 --> 00:04:45.075
So that very simple gullible good people,
very righteous believers of God,

00:04:45.276 --> 00:04:52.162
developed this kind of a fear which was put
into their heads by these false people.

00:04:52.363 --> 00:04:55.022
That if you don't do like this, if you
don't pay money to us,

00:04:55.223 --> 00:04:57.661
then God will be wrathful.

00:04:57.862 --> 00:05:06.670
If you do not come to the confession,
then God will be angry with you,

00:05:06.871 --> 00:05:11.002
if you do not tolerate our nonsense,
God will be angry with you.

00:05:11.203 --> 00:05:17.788
All these things started going into
the brains of the people very easily.

00:05:17.989 --> 00:05:22.593
In some religion they believe there is
no sin in drinking.

00:05:22.794 --> 00:05:27.806
In some religion they believe there is
no sin in marrying many women.

00:05:28.007 --> 00:05:32.255
In some religion they believe that you
can have caste system.

00:05:32.456 --> 00:05:40.711
All is anti-God, absolutely anti-God
activity perpetuated into the society

00:05:40.912 --> 00:05:47.033
by these priests who are supposed to be
in charge of the religion.

00:05:47.234 --> 00:05:54.157
So the first horrible conditioning we have
when we start Sahaja Yoga is this.

00:05:56.604 --> 00:06:01.099
So to start something afresh they find it
very difficult.

00:06:02.371 --> 00:06:10.226
So the first protection Mother had
to render is from this conditioning.

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:14.375
The second one is that of the country.

00:06:14.576 --> 00:06:18.285
Either you belong to this country,
to that country, or to that country.

00:06:18.486 --> 00:06:28.694
And these days every country is competing
with each other in all kinds of

00:06:31.051 --> 00:06:36.865
corruption, mafia, all kinds of things,
every country.

00:06:37.066 --> 00:06:39.899
Suddenly you discover.

00:06:40.592 --> 00:06:43.654
You have faith in one country, you find,
oh no, no, they were supporting

00:06:43.855 --> 00:06:48.237
certain person secretly.

00:06:48.438 --> 00:06:51.099
So whether they are democratic or anything,

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:56.191
there is a kind of a mafia working
everywhere under some name.

00:06:56.392 --> 00:07:02.693
So the so-called laws also are only
for people who are simple, gullible,

00:07:02.894 --> 00:07:07.340
pure citizens, and not for the people
who put those laws on them.

00:07:07.541 --> 00:07:10.940
They take bribes, they take all kinds
of things, but still

00:07:11.141 --> 00:07:16.106
they are supposed to be in charge of law,
doing all kinds of illegal things,

00:07:16.307 --> 00:07:20.515
because they have made the law, so they
know how to be illegal.

00:07:20.716 --> 00:07:26.205
So this is the second type of fear that is
in the minds of the modern time.

00:07:26.406 --> 00:07:32.322
Then the third thing was the war.
Wars after wars came in,

00:07:32.523 --> 00:07:38.089
so many people developed a kind of a fear
about war,

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:43.573
and as a reaction they developed a kind
of a stupid ego,

00:07:43.781 --> 00:07:47.480
just they said, to protect themselves.

00:07:48.491 --> 00:07:54.526
In protection, themselves, they have
built up a big ego

00:07:54.727 --> 00:08:02.392
and they are now becoming very,
we should say, aggressive people.

00:08:04.576 --> 00:08:14.326
So this kind of a wider range,
I should say, of fear,

00:08:14.527 --> 00:08:20.705
it can be directed into any direction,
it can be directed towards anyone.

00:08:20.906 --> 00:08:28.853
Then comes - is the fear of race -
racialism.

00:08:29.054 --> 00:08:34.624
Now I'm told that neo-nazism is taking
its own course

00:08:34.825 --> 00:08:38.462
and is coming up like a little snake.

00:08:41.096 --> 00:08:46.943
So this is another area which is very
dangerous now, working out.

00:08:49.579 --> 00:08:54.692
Now in the minds of seekers -
in their seeking,

00:08:54.893 --> 00:08:57.450
they have been to many gurus, they have
read all kinds of books

00:08:57.651 --> 00:09:01.443
but they were seeking, you know.
They can, they were seeking, yet...

00:09:01.644 --> 00:09:04.993
drink any kind of water, develop all kinds
of diseases, what can you do?

00:09:05.194 --> 00:09:10.338
You are seeking after all, you are thirsty.
It has to be excused.

00:09:10.539 --> 00:09:13.306
And that's how they develop lots
of problems,

00:09:13.507 --> 00:09:16.642
not only in their body but also
in their brain.

00:09:16.843 --> 00:09:20.560
And now it's a very delicate thing.
If you tell somebody

00:09:20.761 --> 00:09:23.928
that you have been to such and such guru,
he doesn't want to hear

00:09:24.129 --> 00:09:27.471
because for him now the guru has become
the last word.

00:09:27.672 --> 00:09:30.793
You cannot say anything against his guru.

00:09:30.994 --> 00:09:34.542
Now when he starts suffering, then he may
accept,

00:09:34.743 --> 00:09:37.731
but to take it out that guru is also
very delicate

00:09:37.932 --> 00:09:42.128
because if you want to take out that guru,
then he might be hurt.

00:09:42.329 --> 00:09:46.117
So it's a very delicate operation.

00:09:47.555 --> 00:09:51.965
Then the modern society, the less said
the better.

00:09:52.166 --> 00:09:56.581
The norms of modern society are given
to us by people

00:09:56.782 --> 00:10:03.154
who were characterless like Freud, who had
no sense of morality,

00:10:03.355 --> 00:10:07.657
or by drunkards, though they don't have
any statues of drunkards.

00:10:07.858 --> 00:10:14.266
But most of them, if you see the abandonment
of our value system comes through drinking.

00:10:14.467 --> 00:10:17.620
And the drinking was there but not
to this extent, I mean,

00:10:17.821 --> 00:10:21.068
everybody was not a drunkard, these days
everybody can be a drunkard.

00:10:21.269 --> 00:10:24.308
And there's no shame about it.
With that drinking

00:10:24.479 --> 00:10:32.367
our value system started dropping down
and people have accepted now,

00:10:32.568 --> 00:10:37.154
the normal thing is abandonment.
This is another way.

00:10:39.798 --> 00:10:44.587
Formerly the parents used to support
the person if he would take to God,

00:10:44.788 --> 00:10:48.493
if he would take to righteous life
or to something higher.

00:10:48.694 --> 00:10:52.476
And if they saw these qualities in their
child they used to be happy,

00:10:52.677 --> 00:10:57.353
but these days the other way round,
the parents don't like it.

00:10:58.839 --> 00:11:02.393
As if the parents have lost everything
in themselves,

00:11:02.594 --> 00:11:07.914
so they want to hold on to their children,
grandchildren and possess them.

00:11:08.603 --> 00:11:12.146
And brainless creatures, because their
brain has been already washed out,

00:11:12.347 --> 00:11:18.104
there's nothing in their brains. To fight
the parents also is a big problem.

00:11:18.305 --> 00:11:22.005
So this kind of a fear is also there, that:
"My mother should not know,

00:11:22.206 --> 00:11:26.072
my father should not know," this, that.

00:11:26.844 --> 00:11:30.178
You can say from all sides

00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:37.616
the fear is burning, like flames.

00:11:37.817 --> 00:11:45.099
And we are now here, in Kali Yuga, we have
started Sahaja Yoga.

00:11:48.037 --> 00:11:57.329
So the way we have to work out
our protection has to be mutual.

00:11:57.530 --> 00:12:04.231
Mother of course is there to protect you
all the time,

00:12:04.432 --> 00:12:07.620
Her powers are there to protect you.

00:12:07.821 --> 00:12:12.312
But surprisingly in the modern times,

00:12:12.513 --> 00:12:17.349
there's one condition which has to be
fulfilled.

00:12:19.159 --> 00:12:24.504
Because in those days good were good

00:12:24.705 --> 00:12:29.725
and evil were evil, there was no mixing up.

00:12:30.434 --> 00:12:33.358
So once they asked for Goddess, they
accepted Her,

00:12:33.559 --> 00:12:36.946
She came in Her real form and She worked
it out.

00:12:37.147 --> 00:12:42.067
But in modern times, you must know that
all these evil things

00:12:42.268 --> 00:12:46.576
are also lingering in your head, little bit
here and there.

00:12:46.777 --> 00:12:49.191
People are extremely superficial,

00:12:49.392 --> 00:12:56.589
they are very much prone to the mass
attitude, fashions, things like that.

00:12:56.790 --> 00:13:01.794
Sort of, their personality is not that
developed as that

00:13:01.995 --> 00:13:06.494
of those bhaktas who knew they were right,
who knew they were righteous,

00:13:06.695 --> 00:13:08.744
who knew whatever they were doing
was correct

00:13:08.945 --> 00:13:15.895
and were standing on their legs firm.

00:13:16.096 --> 00:13:24.908
So the modern Sahaja Yogi is very different
from the Sahaja Yogi of olden times.

00:13:25.109 --> 00:13:31.654
Because in the olden times it was not easy
to get Realization.

00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:36.756
One in a billion, or in a trillion.

00:13:38.122 --> 00:13:42.850
And they had to work very hard, so as they
worked hard, very hard,

00:13:43.051 --> 00:13:47.876
they got cleansed and built up themselves,
you see, and toiled.

00:13:48.077 --> 00:13:52.811
Like any art piece which takes time,
is done with care,

00:13:52.982 --> 00:13:56.076
is definitely thousand times better than
these modern artists

00:13:56.277 --> 00:13:59.033
just putting two, three lines like this.

00:13:59.234 --> 00:14:03.529
So the today's human being is like a modern
artist, you see.

00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:07.286
You put one line and you say: "You must
see this into that person,

00:14:07.487 --> 00:14:10.808
you must have an identity." I mean,
what identity people can have?

00:14:11.009 --> 00:14:15.494
With one line, you say, find out
the identity.

00:14:18.025 --> 00:14:22.647
So the Sahaja Yogis which are today here,
have to realize

00:14:22.848 --> 00:14:30.218
that all these things are surrounding us,
and these evil forces are also there.

00:14:30.419 --> 00:14:34.667
There are some within us, some are without.

00:14:35.256 --> 00:14:40.730
So it's a - looks to be very difficult
task, but it's not.

00:14:43.304 --> 00:14:48.413
Because one condition if you can
understand,

00:14:49.828 --> 00:14:53.219
is that you have to recognize Me.

00:14:53.428 --> 00:14:58.637
I know I am Mahamaya, I'm really very
clever at it.

00:15:04.431 --> 00:15:10.714
But I am truthful, I do not have crocodile
tears, I cannot have.

00:15:11.081 --> 00:15:16.694
I am truthful, but still I am Mahamaya.

00:15:16.895 --> 00:15:22.189
So to recognize Me what should we do?

00:15:23.088 --> 00:15:27.629
If we recognize then you are protected.

00:15:30.416 --> 00:15:37.752
And the cleansing is the simplest thing
in Sahaja Yoga is to be collective.

00:15:37.953 --> 00:15:44.116
If you are not collective then know that
something wrong with you.

00:15:44.443 --> 00:15:50.558
If you are collective then as if you are
taking your bath in the river Ganges.

00:15:50.759 --> 00:15:54.580
You don't have to go to Himalayas, you
don't have to do individual sadhana much,

00:15:54.781 --> 00:15:57.895
you don't have to... just be collective.
If you are collective,

00:15:58.096 --> 00:16:04.303
if you are enjoying the collective, then
you should know that you are clean.

00:16:04.504 --> 00:16:10.388
No blemishes there, you are absolutely
all right.

00:16:12.445 --> 00:16:17.427
Now the second part of is - this Mahamaya
business.

00:16:17.627 --> 00:16:22.123
I had to be very close to you, I had to be
extremely close,

00:16:22.324 --> 00:16:26.582
talk to you, to have a rapport, to tell you
everything about Yoga

00:16:26.783 --> 00:16:32.602
to make you absolutely aware of yourself.
This had to be done,

00:16:32.803 --> 00:16:36.416
and with all these complications within
your mind,

00:16:36.625 --> 00:16:42.080
within your heart, within your body, I had
to work it out.

00:16:42.281 --> 00:16:49.652
To come close in the real form would have
been very dangerous,

00:16:49.853 --> 00:16:55.825
so One had to be a Mahamaya. But
despite that,

00:16:58.549 --> 00:17:05.554
if you could recognize Me,
to understand Me,

00:17:05.755 --> 00:17:12.023
that I am Divine personality,
it's an Incarnation -

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:18.649
that's all the Deities want. Then they'll
look after you in every way.

00:17:18.850 --> 00:17:23.934
They'll give you all the powers, they'll
give you all the satisfaction,

00:17:24.135 --> 00:17:29.995
all the protection that you want. This is
the condition

00:17:30.894 --> 00:17:34.608
which for a rational mind is very difficult
to understand,

00:17:34.809 --> 00:17:40.661
that how can Adi Shakti be in one body?

00:17:41.695 --> 00:17:46.076
How can the Infinite can become finite?

00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:51.198
But human beings cannot do that.

00:17:51.882 --> 00:17:57.921
Only human beings. God can do it. He is God
after all.

00:17:59.145 --> 00:18:05.347
And if so, you have so many miracles,
you have so many photographs,

00:18:05.548 --> 00:18:11.315
so many things to see, but this is what
one has to recognize.

00:18:11.928 --> 00:18:16.676
Now I see people, when I talk to them

00:18:16.877 --> 00:18:21.872
they start talking to Me a little
frivolously,

00:18:22.073 --> 00:18:28.521
not with that depth, not with that feeling
that I am Mahamaya.

00:18:28.729 --> 00:18:33.504
Then some of them even answer Me. Some
of them, if I tell them something,

00:18:33.705 --> 00:18:39.883
they are ready to give an answer,
explanation.

00:18:40.084 --> 00:18:44.841
Of course this freedom I have given you
deliberately,

00:18:45.906 --> 00:18:53.596
but must understand that you have
to talk to Me

00:18:53.797 --> 00:19:00.460
in a way that is, you would talk
to Adi Shakti.

00:19:01.034 --> 00:19:03.535
Very important.

00:19:08.918 --> 00:19:15.819
Then how you behave is very important.
You should not be artificial,

00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:22.113
you should not be superficial, but best is
to put your hand on your heart,

00:19:22.314 --> 00:19:27.883
both the hands, and just try to feel it.

00:19:28.861 --> 00:19:32.332
Your Mother is Adi Shakti.

00:19:32.802 --> 00:19:39.291
She has created all this Universe, She
has created all this world,

00:19:40.007 --> 00:19:47.755
She is for your protection. Even
Shri Krishna could not protect

00:19:48.631 --> 00:19:54.026
Pandavas - they had to go in the forest,
they had to suffer.

00:19:54.227 --> 00:19:57.767
But not Sahaja Yogis.

00:19:58.706 --> 00:20:05.157
As soon as I come to know about your
problems, My attention can work out.

00:20:05.358 --> 00:20:09.480
Shri Rama Himself had to go to jungles.

00:20:09.681 --> 00:20:17.961
All this is given to you, this protection,
because you are seekers of truth,

00:20:18.162 --> 00:20:26.426
and the truth is that I am the Adi Shakti
incarnated.

00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:38.558
Once this truth becomes one with yourself

00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:44.590
there is nothing to fear, because
all the Deities know this fact,

00:20:44.798 --> 00:20:49.703
they know about this Incarnation very well.
They are all prepared for it,

00:20:49.904 --> 00:20:58.825
and they'll do anything to substantiate
your belief.

00:20:59.565 --> 00:21:04.851
In every way they are trying to give you
My photographs, in the sky, this, that,

00:21:05.052 --> 00:21:09.696
I mean all sorts of things. God knows what
they are going to do today.

00:21:10.158 --> 00:21:13.109
They are so anxious.

00:21:13.403 --> 00:21:17.654
They are behind the stage, before
the stage, all sides of the stage,

00:21:17.855 --> 00:21:23.484
listening to Me, feeling happy that I am
telling you the truth.

00:21:23.685 --> 00:21:30.905
But the way they recognize and the way
they act, they never disobey.

00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:37.880
If you behave in the same manner

00:21:38.081 --> 00:21:43.724
you are completely protected from all these
problems I have told you about.

00:21:45.385 --> 00:21:51.701
Now I won't say you shouldn't hate anyone,
you shouldn't do.., nothing of the kind.

00:21:55.084 --> 00:21:59.170
I wouldn't say you should not steal
something.

00:21:59.371 --> 00:22:05.778
I wouldn't say that you make money, don't
make money out of Sahaja Yoga, nothing.

00:22:05.979 --> 00:22:09.989
I don't even say don't drink, don't smoke,
I never said so.

00:22:10.190 --> 00:22:15.059
But automatically once you know whom
you are facing,

00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:19.460
in whose protection you are, automatically
you will do that.

00:22:19.661 --> 00:22:22.575
Automatically. You will have no fear.

00:22:22.776 --> 00:22:27.516
Once you have recognized you will have
no fear from anyone.

00:22:27.717 --> 00:22:35.325
And the more you show that recognition,
the more you realize it,

00:22:35.526 --> 00:22:41.522
you get higher and higher. Not only
spiritually,

00:22:41.723 --> 00:22:47.895
but every way - mentally, socially,
economically, politically.

00:22:50.714 --> 00:22:54.092
It's very remarkable

00:22:55.625 --> 00:23:01.869
that not only that you recognize Me
as a Mother who loves you very much,

00:23:02.070 --> 00:23:09.726
but a Mother who is powerful to protect
you, She’s very powerful.

00:23:13.021 --> 00:23:17.462
If you realize that, and if you feel that
within your heart,

00:23:17.663 --> 00:23:22.832
supposing I correct you sometime, instead
of feeling sad you should see it

00:23:23.033 --> 00:23:27.297
that "How fortunate I am that Adi Shakti
Herself is correcting me.

00:23:27.498 --> 00:23:30.802
She is taking interest in me.

00:23:31.003 --> 00:23:35.607
How fortunate I am to be born at this time,

00:23:35.808 --> 00:23:42.067
to be with Her in Her great work, what
have I done?"

00:23:44.807 --> 00:23:53.015
This recognition itself will fulfil all
the incarnations of Navaratri.

00:23:53.216 --> 00:23:59.019
So today we are worshipping the Durga,
Kali,

00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:03.743
all these great Goddesses, these Powers,
even Radha.

00:24:03.944 --> 00:24:07.116
It was Radha who killed Kamsa not
Shri Krishna.

00:24:07.332 --> 00:24:13.979
He had to ask Radha to come and kill him.
It's the Power that kills.

00:24:20.717 --> 00:24:25.210
So if you realize

00:24:26.030 --> 00:24:32.424
that your Mother is the Adi Shakti.

00:24:32.625 --> 00:24:35.869
I know of so many people.

00:24:36.505 --> 00:24:41.215
There's one gentleman who is working
in London airport.

00:24:41.582 --> 00:24:44.077
Somebody tried to trouble him. He said:
"You see, be careful of?ah...

00:24:44.278 --> 00:24:47.636
my Mother is very powerful, you don't
know."

00:24:47.805 --> 00:24:52.975
Next day that man lost his job, lost
his business, lost this, lost this,

00:24:53.176 --> 00:24:58.345
and he came to him and said: "Now which
is your Mother, let me see Her?"

00:25:03.464 --> 00:25:10.002
There was a farmer in, near Rahuri,

00:25:10.203 --> 00:25:17.095
and in the night three men came to steal
some sugar cane.

00:25:18.542 --> 00:25:25.714
And next day they came and they said:
"Which Goddess do you worship?"

00:25:25.915 --> 00:25:34.984
He said: "Why?". "There were three hefty
people watching your - guarding your field,

00:25:35.192 --> 00:25:38.450
and we came just to... and we thought,
better take some of this sugar cane,

00:25:38.651 --> 00:25:45.977
after all, it looks so nice, and they beat
us. Of course we never got hurt."

00:25:49.314 --> 00:25:54.377
So just behind this recognition is
all the powers.

00:25:54.578 --> 00:25:58.692
There's so many, so many stories I can
tell you,

00:25:58.893 --> 00:26:02.918
how things have happened, how it has
worked out.

00:26:05.785 --> 00:26:13.114
But if you are doubting, still halfway,
this, that, then things won't be all right.

00:26:14.973 --> 00:26:18.219
You shouldn't worry about your reputation.

00:26:18.420 --> 00:26:25.691
Just go with full speed into any direction,
knowing one thing -

00:26:25.892 --> 00:26:34.602
that you are My child, and that I am
Adi Shakti.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.952
Everything that looks horrible will become
better.

00:26:39.153 --> 00:26:44.496
We have seen it now in this France case,
and all that, what has happened.

00:26:44.697 --> 00:26:49.678
Don't worry about anything, just know that

00:26:51.647 --> 00:26:54.454
I am the Adi Shakti.

00:26:54.655 --> 00:27:01.722
That all the powers of Gods and Goddesses
and all that are within Me,

00:27:01.923 --> 00:27:06.123
and they are within Me, and they are all
looking after you.

00:27:06.324 --> 00:27:11.959
But if that recognition is not there, they
are not going to recognize you either.

00:27:18.381 --> 00:27:23.709
So for today's Navaratri I have to tell you
that just try to keep in mind

00:27:23.910 --> 00:27:29.572
that today you are worshipping
the Adi Shakti and not only Durga.

00:27:31.329 --> 00:27:35.747
And you are worshipping Durga and all
these Goddesses to thank them.

00:27:35.948 --> 00:27:39.794
Because if they had not saved you that time
you would have been so frightened,

00:27:39.995 --> 00:27:43.791
you would have become bad people and
you would not have been here.

00:27:43.992 --> 00:27:47.970
That is why we are thankful to them
for saving us

00:27:48.179 --> 00:27:54.697
and giving us this protection at that time
when we were very helpless.

00:27:59.866 --> 00:28:02.736
May God bless you all.
