WEBVTT

00:03.971 --> 00:10.599
Today we have gathered here to do
the Navaratri Puja.

00:13.210 --> 00:19.063
There were nine times when the major
incarnations

00:19.264 --> 00:24.203
of the Mother of this universe

00:26.705 --> 00:32.836
were manifested. They were manifested
with a purpose.

00:33.190 --> 00:43.025
That purpose is to protect Her bhaktas,
Her disciples, Her children.

00:43.297 --> 00:46.227
This was

00:51.069 --> 01:02.090
a binding love, She could not escape it.

01:02.291 --> 01:07.862
Mother's love is binding, She cannot
escape it

01:08.063 --> 01:14.188
and She has to manifest it, work it out

01:14.396 --> 01:19.470
and give that protection to all
Her children.

01:22.130 --> 01:27.829
This protection in the modern times
has taken another form.

01:28.030 --> 01:35.236
In those days, the evil was trying

01:35.437 --> 01:41.584
to harm, to destroy the people who were
righteous,

01:41.785 --> 01:45.651
who were bhaktas, who were doing
good things,

01:45.852 --> 01:51.417
who wanted to lead a very religious life.

01:51.618 --> 01:57.185
So to save them, She incarnated.
To protect them, She incarnated.

01:57.386 --> 02:01.937
But they knew what was good, they knew
what was wrong.

02:03.034 --> 02:08.596
And they wanted to preserve their good
life, their precious life.

02:08.797 --> 02:12.520
They didn't care for money, they didn't
care for power,

02:12.721 --> 02:16.462
but just they wanted their life,

02:16.663 --> 02:21.718
means they wanted to be alive to worship
the Goddess.

02:21.919 --> 02:26.267
And when they were troubled or harmed
or destroyed

02:26.468 --> 02:29.968
by these evil forces, She had to manifest.

02:30.169 --> 02:34.188
But in modern times it's become
very complicated

02:34.389 --> 02:37.826
as the modern times are complicated.

02:38.034 --> 02:40.780
First of all,

02:41.549 --> 02:47.597
in the mind, in the lifestyle,
in the society

02:47.798 --> 02:54.167
of good human beings, righteous human
beings,

02:55.060 --> 03:00.349
fear of the wrong has entered.

03:00.550 --> 03:05.256
Like they are afraid say of their priests,
of their churches,

03:05.457 --> 03:09.910
of their temples, of their mosques,
which are all false.

03:10.111 --> 03:14.123
They are not afraid of God, they don't
believe in God.

03:14.292 --> 03:19.479
They think they have created God and they
can manage God. So who is God?

03:19.680 --> 03:23.618
The way they behave you can see clearly
that they do not recognize

03:23.819 --> 03:29.366
the existence of God, God Almighty who is
a wrathful God.

03:29.567 --> 03:33.327
They are not at all worried as to what
will happen to them.

03:33.528 --> 03:38.324
They don't even believe in the second life,
they don't believe in the resurrection.

03:38.525 --> 03:45.043
They are very short-sighted, evil people
doing all kinds of evil things.

03:45.244 --> 03:49.764
So somehow or other, as soon as you
are born,

03:49.965 --> 03:53.491
you are born into some sort of a brand,

03:53.692 --> 03:59.184
you are this, you are that, you are that,
you are that, as soon as you are born.

03:59.385 --> 04:02.053
So the first brand comes onto this
modern man,

04:02.254 --> 04:06.806
is of what religion to which he belongs.

04:07.204 --> 04:13.064
He can't avoid it, he has to be jolly well
belonging to some religion.

04:13.265 --> 04:16.810
You go anywhere, even in the passport -
nowadays they have stopped it -

04:17.011 --> 04:21.671
otherwise they used to ask: "What is
your religion?"

04:22.801 --> 04:28.083
And in India if you said you had no
religion they would not give you a passport

04:28.284 --> 04:31.864
because you are not yet qualified
evil person,

04:32.065 --> 04:36.425
or you are not following qualified
evil people.

04:36.626 --> 04:45.075
So that very simple gullible good people,
very righteous believers of God,

04:45.276 --> 04:52.162
developed this kind of a fear which was put
into their heads by these false people.

04:52.363 --> 04:55.022
That if you don't do like this, if you
don't pay money to us,

04:55.223 --> 04:57.661
then God will be wrathful.

04:57.862 --> 05:06.670
If you do not come to the confession,
then God will be angry with you,

05:06.871 --> 05:11.002
if you do not tolerate our nonsense,
God will be angry with you.

05:11.203 --> 05:17.788
All these things started going into
the brains of the people very easily.

05:17.989 --> 05:22.593
In some religion they believe there is
no sin in drinking.

05:22.794 --> 05:27.806
In some religion they believe there is
no sin in marrying many women.

05:28.007 --> 05:32.255
In some religion they believe that you
can have caste system.

05:32.456 --> 05:40.711
All is anti-God, absolutely anti-God
activity perpetuated into the society

05:40.912 --> 05:47.033
by these priests who are supposed to be
in charge of the religion.

05:47.234 --> 05:54.157
So the first horrible conditioning we have
when we start Sahaja Yoga is this.

05:56.604 --> 06:01.099
So to start something afresh they find it
very difficult.

06:02.371 --> 06:10.226
So the first protection Mother had
to render is from this conditioning.

06:10.980 --> 06:14.375
The second one is that of the country.

06:14.576 --> 06:18.285
Either you belong to this country,
to that country, or to that country.

06:18.486 --> 06:28.694
And these days every country is competing
with each other in all kinds of

06:31.051 --> 06:36.865
corruption, mafia, all kinds of things,
every country.

06:37.066 --> 06:39.899
Suddenly you discover.

06:40.592 --> 06:43.654
You have faith in one country, you find,
oh no, no, they were supporting

06:43.855 --> 06:48.237
certain person secretly.

06:48.438 --> 06:51.099
So whether they are democratic or anything,

06:51.300 --> 06:56.191
there is a kind of a mafia working
everywhere under some name.

06:56.392 --> 07:02.693
So the so-called laws also are only
for people who are simple, gullible,

07:02.894 --> 07:07.340
pure citizens, and not for the people
who put those laws on them.

07:07.541 --> 07:10.940
They take bribes, they take all kinds
of things, but still

07:11.141 --> 07:16.106
they are supposed to be in charge of law,
doing all kinds of illegal things,

07:16.307 --> 07:20.515
because they have made the law, so they
know how to be illegal.

07:20.716 --> 07:26.205
So this is the second type of fear that is
in the minds of the modern time.

07:26.406 --> 07:32.322
Then the third thing was the war.
Wars after wars came in,

07:32.523 --> 07:38.089
so many people developed a kind of a fear
about war,

07:38.290 --> 07:43.573
and as a reaction they developed a kind
of a stupid ego,

07:43.781 --> 07:47.480
just they said, to protect themselves.

07:48.491 --> 07:54.526
In protection, themselves, they have
built up a big ego

07:54.727 --> 08:02.392
and they are now becoming very,
we should say, aggressive people.

08:04.576 --> 08:14.326
So this kind of a wider range,
I should say, of fear,

08:14.527 --> 08:20.705
it can be directed into any direction,
it can be directed towards anyone.

08:20.906 --> 08:28.853
Then comes - is the fear of race -
racialism.

08:29.054 --> 08:34.624
Now I'm told that neo-nazism is taking
its own course

08:34.825 --> 08:38.462
and is coming up like a little snake.

08:41.096 --> 08:46.943
So this is another area which is very
dangerous now, working out.

08:49.579 --> 08:54.692
Now in the minds of seekers -
in their seeking,

08:54.893 --> 08:57.450
they have been to many gurus, they have
read all kinds of books

08:57.651 --> 09:01.443
but they were seeking, you know.
They can, they were seeking, yet...

09:01.644 --> 09:04.993
drink any kind of water, develop all kinds
of diseases, what can you do?

09:05.194 --> 09:10.338
You are seeking after all, you are thirsty.
It has to be excused.

09:10.539 --> 09:13.306
And that's how they develop lots
of problems,

09:13.507 --> 09:16.642
not only in their body but also
in their brain.

09:16.843 --> 09:20.560
And now it's a very delicate thing.
If you tell somebody

09:20.761 --> 09:23.928
that you have been to such and such guru,
he doesn't want to hear

09:24.129 --> 09:27.471
because for him now the guru has become
the last word.

09:27.672 --> 09:30.793
You cannot say anything against his guru.

09:30.994 --> 09:34.542
Now when he starts suffering, then he may
accept,

09:34.743 --> 09:37.731
but to take it out that guru is also
very delicate

09:37.932 --> 09:42.128
because if you want to take out that guru,
then he might be hurt.

09:42.329 --> 09:46.117
So it's a very delicate operation.

09:47.555 --> 09:51.965
Then the modern society, the less said
the better.

09:52.166 --> 09:56.581
The norms of modern society are given
to us by people

09:56.782 --> 10:03.154
who were characterless like Freud, who had
no sense of morality,

10:03.355 --> 10:07.657
or by drunkards, though they don't have
any statues of drunkards.

10:07.858 --> 10:14.266
But most of them, if you see the abandonment
of our value system comes through drinking.

10:14.467 --> 10:17.620
And the drinking was there but not
to this extent, I mean,

10:17.821 --> 10:21.068
everybody was not a drunkard, these days
everybody can be a drunkard.

10:21.269 --> 10:24.308
And there's no shame about it.
With that drinking

10:24.479 --> 10:32.367
our value system started dropping down
and people have accepted now,

10:32.568 --> 10:37.154
the normal thing is abandonment.
This is another way.

10:39.798 --> 10:44.587
Formerly the parents used to support
the person if he would take to God,

10:44.788 --> 10:48.493
if he would take to righteous life
or to something higher.

10:48.694 --> 10:52.476
And if they saw these qualities in their
child they used to be happy,

10:52.677 --> 10:57.353
but these days the other way round,
the parents don't like it.

10:58.839 --> 11:02.393
As if the parents have lost everything
in themselves,

11:02.594 --> 11:07.914
so they want to hold on to their children,
grandchildren and possess them.

11:08.603 --> 11:12.146
And brainless creatures, because their
brain has been already washed out,

11:12.347 --> 11:18.104
there's nothing in their brains. To fight
the parents also is a big problem.

11:18.305 --> 11:22.005
So this kind of a fear is also there, that:
"My mother should not know,

11:22.206 --> 11:26.072
my father should not know," this, that.

11:26.844 --> 11:30.178
You can say from all sides

11:31.830 --> 11:37.616
the fear is burning, like flames.

11:37.817 --> 11:45.099
And we are now here, in Kali Yuga, we have
started Sahaja Yoga.

11:48.037 --> 11:57.329
So the way we have to work out
our protection has to be mutual.

11:57.530 --> 12:04.231
Mother of course is there to protect you
all the time,

12:04.432 --> 12:07.620
Her powers are there to protect you.

12:07.821 --> 12:12.312
But surprisingly in the modern times,

12:12.513 --> 12:17.349
there's one condition which has to be
fulfilled.

12:19.159 --> 12:24.504
Because in those days good were good

12:24.705 --> 12:29.725
and evil were evil, there was no mixing up.

12:30.434 --> 12:33.358
So once they asked for Goddess, they
accepted Her,

12:33.559 --> 12:36.946
She came in Her real form and She worked
it out.

12:37.147 --> 12:42.067
But in modern times, you must know that
all these evil things

12:42.268 --> 12:46.576
are also lingering in your head, little bit
here and there.

12:46.777 --> 12:49.191
People are extremely superficial,

12:49.392 --> 12:56.589
they are very much prone to the mass
attitude, fashions, things like that.

12:56.790 --> 13:01.794
Sort of, their personality is not that
developed as that

13:01.995 --> 13:06.494
of those bhaktas who knew they were right,
who knew they were righteous,

13:06.695 --> 13:08.744
who knew whatever they were doing
was correct

13:08.945 --> 13:15.895
and were standing on their legs firm.

13:16.096 --> 13:24.908
So the modern Sahaja Yogi is very different
from the Sahaja Yogi of olden times.

13:25.109 --> 13:31.654
Because in the olden times it was not easy
to get Realization.

13:31.950 --> 13:36.756
One in a billion, or in a trillion.

13:38.122 --> 13:42.850
And they had to work very hard, so as they
worked hard, very hard,

13:43.051 --> 13:47.876
they got cleansed and built up themselves,
you see, and toiled.

13:48.077 --> 13:52.811
Like any art piece which takes time,
is done with care,

13:52.982 --> 13:56.076
is definitely thousand times better than
these modern artists

13:56.277 --> 13:59.033
just putting two, three lines like this.

13:59.234 --> 14:03.529
So the today's human being is like a modern
artist, you see.

14:03.730 --> 14:07.286
You put one line and you say: "You must
see this into that person,

14:07.487 --> 14:10.808
you must have an identity." I mean,
what identity people can have?

14:11.009 --> 14:15.494
With one line, you say, find out
the identity.

14:18.025 --> 14:22.647
So the Sahaja Yogis which are today here,
have to realize

14:22.848 --> 14:30.218
that all these things are surrounding us,
and these evil forces are also there.

14:30.419 --> 14:34.667
There are some within us, some are without.

14:35.256 --> 14:40.730
So it's a - looks to be very difficult
task, but it's not.

14:43.304 --> 14:48.413
Because one condition if you can
understand,

14:49.828 --> 14:53.219
is that you have to recognize Me.

14:53.428 --> 14:58.637
I know I am Mahamaya, I'm really very
clever at it.

15:04.431 --> 15:10.714
But I am truthful, I do not have crocodile
tears, I cannot have.

15:11.081 --> 15:16.694
I am truthful, but still I am Mahamaya.

15:16.895 --> 15:22.189
So to recognize Me what should we do?

15:23.088 --> 15:27.629
If we recognize then you are protected.

15:30.416 --> 15:37.752
And the cleansing is the simplest thing
in Sahaja Yoga is to be collective.

15:37.953 --> 15:44.116
If you are not collective then know that
something wrong with you.

15:44.443 --> 15:50.558
If you are collective then as if you are
taking your bath in the river Ganges.

15:50.759 --> 15:54.580
You don't have to go to Himalayas, you
don't have to do individual sadhana much,

15:54.781 --> 15:57.895
you don't have to... just be collective.
If you are collective,

15:58.096 --> 16:04.303
if you are enjoying the collective, then
you should know that you are clean.

16:04.504 --> 16:10.388
No blemishes there, you are absolutely
all right.

16:12.445 --> 16:17.427
Now the second part of is - this Mahamaya
business.

16:17.627 --> 16:22.123
I had to be very close to you, I had to be
extremely close,

16:22.324 --> 16:26.582
talk to you, to have a rapport, to tell you
everything about Yoga

16:26.783 --> 16:32.602
to make you absolutely aware of yourself.
This had to be done,

16:32.803 --> 16:36.416
and with all these complications within
your mind,

16:36.625 --> 16:42.080
within your heart, within your body, I had
to work it out.

16:42.281 --> 16:49.652
To come close in the real form would have
been very dangerous,

16:49.853 --> 16:55.825
so One had to be a Mahamaya. But
despite that,

16:58.549 --> 17:05.554
if you could recognize Me,
to understand Me,

17:05.755 --> 17:12.023
that I am Divine personality,
it's an Incarnation -

17:12.920 --> 17:18.649
that's all the Deities want. Then they'll
look after you in every way.

17:18.850 --> 17:23.934
They'll give you all the powers, they'll
give you all the satisfaction,

17:24.135 --> 17:29.995
all the protection that you want. This is
the condition

17:30.894 --> 17:34.608
which for a rational mind is very difficult
to understand,

17:34.809 --> 17:40.661
that how can Adi Shakti be in one body?

17:41.695 --> 17:46.076
How can the Infinite can become finite?

17:47.300 --> 17:51.198
But human beings cannot do that.

17:51.882 --> 17:57.921
Only human beings. God can do it. He is God
after all.

17:59.145 --> 18:05.347
And if so, you have so many miracles,
you have so many photographs,

18:05.548 --> 18:11.315
so many things to see, but this is what
one has to recognize.

18:11.928 --> 18:16.676
Now I see people, when I talk to them

18:16.877 --> 18:21.872
they start talking to Me a little
frivolously,

18:22.073 --> 18:28.521
not with that depth, not with that feeling
that I am Mahamaya.

18:28.729 --> 18:33.504
Then some of them even answer Me. Some
of them, if I tell them something,

18:33.705 --> 18:39.883
they are ready to give an answer,
explanation.

18:40.084 --> 18:44.841
Of course this freedom I have given you
deliberately,

18:45.906 --> 18:53.596
but must understand that you have
to talk to Me

18:53.797 --> 19:00.460
in a way that is, you would talk
to Adi Shakti.

19:01.034 --> 19:03.535
Very important.

19:08.918 --> 19:15.819
Then how you behave is very important.
You should not be artificial,

19:16.020 --> 19:22.113
you should not be superficial, but best is
to put your hand on your heart,

19:22.314 --> 19:27.883
both the hands, and just try to feel it.

19:28.861 --> 19:32.332
Your Mother is Adi Shakti.

19:32.802 --> 19:39.291
She has created all this Universe, She
has created all this world,

19:40.007 --> 19:47.755
She is for your protection. Even
Shri Krishna could not protect

19:48.631 --> 19:54.026
Pandavas - they had to go in the forest,
they had to suffer.

19:54.227 --> 19:57.767
But not Sahaja Yogis.

19:58.706 --> 20:05.157
As soon as I come to know about your
problems, My attention can work out.

20:05.358 --> 20:09.480
Shri Rama Himself had to go to jungles.

20:09.681 --> 20:17.961
All this is given to you, this protection,
because you are seekers of truth,

20:18.162 --> 20:26.426
and the truth is that I am the Adi Shakti
incarnated.

20:33.420 --> 20:38.558
Once this truth becomes one with yourself

20:39.100 --> 20:44.590
there is nothing to fear, because
all the Deities know this fact,

20:44.798 --> 20:49.703
they know about this Incarnation very well.
They are all prepared for it,

20:49.904 --> 20:58.825
and they'll do anything to substantiate
your belief.

20:59.565 --> 21:04.851
In every way they are trying to give you
My photographs, in the sky, this, that,

21:05.052 --> 21:09.696
I mean all sorts of things. God knows what
they are going to do today.

21:10.158 --> 21:13.109
They are so anxious.

21:13.403 --> 21:17.654
They are behind the stage, before
the stage, all sides of the stage,

21:17.855 --> 21:23.484
listening to Me, feeling happy that I am
telling you the truth.

21:23.685 --> 21:30.905
But the way they recognize and the way
they act, they never disobey.

21:34.470 --> 21:37.880
If you behave in the same manner

21:38.081 --> 21:43.724
you are completely protected from all these
problems I have told you about.

21:45.385 --> 21:51.701
Now I won't say you shouldn't hate anyone,
you shouldn't do.., nothing of the kind.

21:55.084 --> 21:59.170
I wouldn't say you should not steal
something.

21:59.371 --> 22:05.778
I wouldn't say that you make money, don't
make money out of Sahaja Yoga, nothing.

22:05.979 --> 22:09.989
I don't even say don't drink, don't smoke,
I never said so.

22:10.190 --> 22:15.059
But automatically once you know whom
you are facing,

22:15.260 --> 22:19.460
in whose protection you are, automatically
you will do that.

22:19.661 --> 22:22.575
Automatically. You will have no fear.

22:22.776 --> 22:27.516
Once you have recognized you will have
no fear from anyone.

22:27.717 --> 22:35.325
And the more you show that recognition,
the more you realize it,

22:35.526 --> 22:41.522
you get higher and higher. Not only
spiritually,

22:41.723 --> 22:47.895
but every way - mentally, socially,
economically, politically.

22:50.714 --> 22:54.092
It's very remarkable

22:55.625 --> 23:01.869
that not only that you recognize Me
as a Mother who loves you very much,

23:02.070 --> 23:09.726
but a Mother who is powerful to protect
you, She’s very powerful.

23:13.021 --> 23:17.462
If you realize that, and if you feel that
within your heart,

23:17.663 --> 23:22.832
supposing I correct you sometime, instead
of feeling sad you should see it

23:23.033 --> 23:27.297
that "How fortunate I am that Adi Shakti
Herself is correcting me.

23:27.498 --> 23:30.802
She is taking interest in me.

23:31.003 --> 23:35.607
How fortunate I am to be born at this time,

23:35.808 --> 23:42.067
to be with Her in Her great work, what
have I done?"

23:44.807 --> 23:53.015
This recognition itself will fulfil all
the incarnations of Navaratri.

23:53.216 --> 23:59.019
So today we are worshipping the Durga,
Kali,

23:59.220 --> 24:03.743
all these great Goddesses, these Powers,
even Radha.

24:03.944 --> 24:07.116
It was Radha who killed Kamsa not
Shri Krishna.

24:07.332 --> 24:13.979
He had to ask Radha to come and kill him.
It's the Power that kills.

24:20.717 --> 24:25.210
So if you realize

24:26.030 --> 24:32.424
that your Mother is the Adi Shakti.

24:32.625 --> 24:35.869
I know of so many people.

24:36.505 --> 24:41.215
There's one gentleman who is working
in London airport.

24:41.582 --> 24:44.077
Somebody tried to trouble him. He said:
"You see, be careful of?ah...

24:44.278 --> 24:47.636
my Mother is very powerful, you don't
know."

24:47.805 --> 24:52.975
Next day that man lost his job, lost
his business, lost this, lost this,

24:53.176 --> 24:58.345
and he came to him and said: "Now which
is your Mother, let me see Her?"

25:03.464 --> 25:10.002
There was a farmer in, near Rahuri,

25:10.203 --> 25:17.095
and in the night three men came to steal
some sugar cane.

25:18.542 --> 25:25.714
And next day they came and they said:
"Which Goddess do you worship?"

25:25.915 --> 25:34.984
He said: "Why?". "There were three hefty
people watching your - guarding your field,

25:35.192 --> 25:38.450
and we came just to... and we thought,
better take some of this sugar cane,

25:38.651 --> 25:45.977
after all, it looks so nice, and they beat
us. Of course we never got hurt."

25:49.314 --> 25:54.377
So just behind this recognition is
all the powers.

25:54.578 --> 25:58.692
There's so many, so many stories I can
tell you,

25:58.893 --> 26:02.918
how things have happened, how it has
worked out.

26:05.785 --> 26:13.114
But if you are doubting, still halfway,
this, that, then things won't be all right.

26:14.973 --> 26:18.219
You shouldn't worry about your reputation.

26:18.420 --> 26:25.691
Just go with full speed into any direction,
knowing one thing -

26:25.892 --> 26:34.602
that you are My child, and that I am
Adi Shakti.

26:36.000 --> 26:38.952
Everything that looks horrible will become
better.

26:39.153 --> 26:44.496
We have seen it now in this France case,
and all that, what has happened.

26:44.697 --> 26:49.678
Don't worry about anything, just know that

26:51.647 --> 26:54.454
I am the Adi Shakti.

26:54.655 --> 27:01.722
That all the powers of Gods and Goddesses
and all that are within Me,

27:01.923 --> 27:06.123
and they are within Me, and they are all
looking after you.

27:06.324 --> 27:11.959
But if that recognition is not there, they
are not going to recognize you either.

27:18.381 --> 27:23.709
So for today's Navaratri I have to tell you
that just try to keep in mind

27:23.910 --> 27:29.572
that today you are worshipping
the Adi Shakti and not only Durga.

27:31.329 --> 27:35.747
And you are worshipping Durga and all
these Goddesses to thank them.

27:35.948 --> 27:39.794
Because if they had not saved you that time
you would have been so frightened,

27:39.995 --> 27:43.791
you would have become bad people and
you would not have been here.

27:43.992 --> 27:47.970
That is why we are thankful to them
for saving us

27:48.179 --> 27:54.697
and giving us this protection at that time
when we were very helpless.

27:59.866 --> 28:02.736
May God bless you all.
