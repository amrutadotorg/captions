1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,667
And this is how the things go on accumulating

2
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:13,941
which has no value aesthetically or in any way.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,669
Actually you should buy something 
only to give it to someone.

4
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:21,875
That's the best way of enjoying it 
to the maximum, you see.

5
00:00:21,956 --> 00:00:23,956
And anybody likes it - have it.

6
00:00:24,042 --> 00:00:26,862
You see, that's the best way.
It's a great thing,

7
00:00:26,942 --> 00:00:30,752
I mean I tell you it's rather difficult 
for you people to understand,

8
00:00:30,832 --> 00:00:33,686
but I am one of them who does that very often,

9
00:00:33,767 --> 00:00:37,291
and my children and my husband 
are rather worried you know,

10
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:40,961
"God knows next time what She'll give away."

11
00:00:41,042 --> 00:00:43,042
But you'll be amazed I've so many things,

12
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:45,003
so many things, despite all this,

13
00:00:45,084 --> 00:00:47,917
I mean the whole time thinking 
what to give to whom,

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,086
still it's so many things in the house, now 
that we have to take a bigger house.

15
00:00:52,167 --> 00:00:54,753
I don't know what to do with so many things

16
00:00:54,834 --> 00:00:58,917
and I try to thrust things on the people, 
"Baba you take this you have liked it."

17
00:00:58,959 --> 00:01:01,044
But they say: "No no no how can you give me."

18
00:01:01,125 --> 00:01:04,336
But really that gives me such a pleasure,

19
00:01:04,417 --> 00:01:06,836
and one must learn how to do.

20
00:01:06,917 --> 00:01:10,667
But I've have seen human beings are different.
For themselves they'll buy diamonds,

21
00:01:10,708 --> 00:01:14,126
and for others they'll buy artificial things.

22
00:01:14,542 --> 00:01:16,000
It's very common you know.

23
00:01:16,042 --> 00:01:18,048
They will buy for, they are wearing diamonds

24
00:01:18,129 --> 00:01:21,133
and when it is coming to giving to others 
they'll give artificial.

25
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:23,546
At least don't wear at that time the diamond.

26
00:01:23,627 --> 00:01:25,627
At least that much decency should be there.

27
00:01:25,708 --> 00:01:29,878
So you see when it comes to giving, 
give it with your full heart.

28
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:32,166
You just feel that love of giving

29
00:01:32,247 --> 00:01:36,852
and you feel so happy, because 
you feel so big about yourself,

30
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:40,333
like an ocean that's giving so much of clouds

31
00:01:40,375 --> 00:01:44,461
and again it is receiving these rivers into it, 
and again making it into clouds,

32
00:01:44,542 --> 00:01:49,417
a sort of a circle of beautiful 
conversion into beauty

33
00:01:49,458 --> 00:01:51,875
after beauty starts, it's so beautiful.

34
00:01:52,375 --> 00:01:55,333
And that's what we should try to become,

35
00:01:55,458 --> 00:01:58,792
a part of that circle, which is so beautiful

36
00:01:58,834 --> 00:02:02,180
and which is so joy giving, to yourself also.

37
00:02:02,583 --> 00:02:07,667
And this is what it is, and this hand is 
for ashraya, means for the protection.

38
00:02:08,542 --> 00:02:13,167
You must protect the people 
who are your subordinates,

39
00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:16,042
who are dependent on you, your children.

40
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:20,643
Like, it's a very common thing to insult 
your children from their childhood.

41
00:02:20,792 --> 00:02:23,078
Why did you spoil that carpet?

42
00:02:23,332 --> 00:02:27,131
Why did you do that? You should not have
said this, why did you?

43
00:02:27,211 --> 00:02:29,583
This is a very wrong thing of discipline.

44
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,687
Best discipline is to put dignity into children.

45
00:02:34,084 --> 00:02:37,836
You see, a good home in India we'll say,

46
00:02:37,917 --> 00:02:41,627
is known by the way children 
are addressed in the family.

47
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:47,458
Like, in a good family we address the children like "Sa".

48
00:02:47,628 --> 00:02:50,424
Little bit like that, ap, means 'Sir'.

49
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:53,753
We never address the children with indignity,

50
00:02:53,834 --> 00:02:56,854
and we put them on a dignified level.

51
00:02:57,333 --> 00:03:00,195
And it's a very nice thing.

52
00:03:00,275 --> 00:03:02,711
I'll tell you about my own granddaughter,

53
00:03:02,792 --> 00:03:09,834
that, somebody was telling her one day that, 
there's a very, this boy

54
00:03:09,965 --> 00:03:11,537
and why don't you marry him.

55
00:03:11,618 --> 00:03:13,896
She said: 'Why do you want 
to talk about marriage?

56
00:03:13,977 --> 00:03:17,208
I'm not yet grown at all 
to think about marriage,

57
00:03:17,289 --> 00:03:20,084
and we have to be dignified about things,

58
00:03:20,165 --> 00:03:23,419
how can we think of marriage 
when we are not to think,

59
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:28,084
and my grandmother will marry me 
and I want to live, a dignified person.'

60
00:03:28,084 --> 00:03:32,250
A little girl of seven years said this 
to this woman who was very,

61
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:35,417
sort of pseudo-intellectual type and she tried

62
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:39,291
to tease my granddaughter. 
She said: 'It's not dignified'.

63
00:03:39,792 --> 00:03:43,917
Just think of that. At the age of seven years 
they have their sense of dignity.

64
00:03:43,998 --> 00:03:48,009
If you tell them, you see they, you need 
not tell them don't spoil the carpet,

65
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:51,458
but give them dignity they will never spoil it.
