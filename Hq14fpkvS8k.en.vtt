00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:09.320
That, the central one is the sustaining power
means is the power by which we evolve, that

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.309
means we get our sustenance as it is.

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:19.870
This sustenance that we have got as a human
being when it is to be manifested on the five

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:28.340
elements that we have within ourselves, the
source is there but we have to reach it through

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:29.890
its different elements.

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:41.320
When this interchange takes place or, we can
say, when we have to put this force outside,

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:47.460
that is to be done through establishment of
Dharma on these.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.750
Like a superimposition or, you can say, the
connection.

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.550
Like you can say, say there is sun.

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:07.680
Sun is the source of light and the source
of light has (to?) come to this earth which

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.680
is created out of the five elements.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:21.861
So the sun’s rays have to come, but when
they come inside, in this move, what do they

00:01:21.861 --> 00:01:24.250
do?

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.400
They enlighten this world.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.030
But it’s only possible if there is Dharma,
means the light is there, the rays are there.

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.350
The rays can be obstructed by many things.

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:46.440
If the rays are obstructed, then there is
a-dharma.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:55.970
So the source of Dharma, the spreading of
Dharma and ultimately the manifestation onto

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.229
the five elements is a complete thing that
is Void.

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:04.479
This play goes on within us.

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:10.039
Our evolutionary power which has worked from
the very beginning, from matter state, when

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:16.870
the matter got itself as organized then we
had carbon as tetravalent, then from carbon,

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.810
the life started – all this is the work
of the sustaining force.

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.630
Then we became human beings.

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.490
Now we have got ten dharmas within us which
we have to keep alright.

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.950
These are the main ten commandments.

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.490
These ten commandments we have to look after.

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:45.533
And these are looked after by the people who
are the primordial masters, as you call them

00:02:45.583 --> 00:02:56.384
“incarnations”…(a noise covers the voice)
like Raja Janaka, like Moses, like Socrates,

00:02:56.384 --> 00:03:05.164
like Nanaka, the last one was the Shirdi Sai
Nath.

00:03:08.014 --> 00:03:13.204
This is the principle is there, is the primordial
master.

00:03:13.314 --> 00:03:21.590
Now, there is another principle that is in
there by which you receive it.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:28.240
This is called as the disciple principle,
the primordial disciple principle, represented

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:40.170
by the moon and the sun, presided by Buddha
and Mahavira.

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:51.585
So, this disciple element if it is not in
you, you cannot receive it.

00:03:51.695 --> 00:03:59.880
But when you start getting – receiving it,
this Dharma gets into you and then you become

00:03:59.974 --> 00:04:00.974
the guru.

00:04:00.974 --> 00:04:06.560
You become the guru when this is completely
sustained in you.

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:15.031
It starts as a disciple and then ends up as
a Guru.

00:04:12.891 --> 00:04:29.771
First of all, as the human beings are, we
do not observe the first ten basic principles.

00:04:15.031 --> 00:04:18.121
This is the Void part within us.

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:36.439
In this country for example, or in the West,
we have – we observe the five of them because

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:40.290
of laws.

00:04:41.103 --> 00:04:49.993
In the countries like India, they observe
the rest five, because of their society.

00:04:50.063 --> 00:04:55.160
So in any way we are lacking some of them.

00:04:55.274 --> 00:04:58.900
Five are missing here or five are missing
there.

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:03.640
This is the situation of the Dharma today.

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:17.590
The Gurus and their disciples they do this
connection and then the matter, which is created

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:25.543
out of five elements, get vibrated.

00:05:25.609 --> 00:05:29.079
You can enlighten the matter.

00:05:29.173 --> 00:05:34.148
When the Dharma is complete you can enlighten
the matter.

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:43.957
The rituals that these people used which was
called as you see, do Dharmik rituals, they

00:05:44.167 --> 00:05:50.787
call them do dharmik, these are the deeds
of Dharma, is to worship, to do Puja and to

00:05:51.037 --> 00:05:58.048
pray to God and to do all these things, prayer.

00:05:58.578 --> 00:06:08.198
All these things after some time became absolutely
deadened because there was no realized soul

00:06:08.198 --> 00:06:13.564
as a Guru and no realized soul as a disciple.

00:06:13.716 --> 00:06:16.674
So it was just a joke going on, you see.

00:06:16.794 --> 00:06:18.454
It has no meaning.

00:06:18.554 --> 00:06:25.506
Supposing I tell somebody who is not realized
to give himself a bandhan, he cannot.

00:06:25.566 --> 00:06:28.226
[Aside: “He is coming back, don’t you
worry!

00:06:28.276 --> 00:06:30.656
Both of them have run away.

00:06:30.726 --> 00:06:33.966
He’ll agree then somehow.

00:06:33.966 --> 00:06:36.786
The sister is realized, the wife is realized.

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:37.546
Born.

00:06:37.607 --> 00:06:40.607
But the husband is like that, what to do?

00:06:43.517 --> 00:06:44.927
Yogi: He came.

00:06:44.946 --> 00:06:46.397
Shri Mataji: Eh?

00:06:46.472 --> 00:06:47.592
He came in.

00:06:47.592 --> 00:06:48.792
(Yogis: “Came”.)

00:06:48.877 --> 00:06:52.167
Came, ran away half-way, he still cannot decide
which way to go.

00:06:52.388 --> 00:06:56.638
(A yogi says something)

00:06:56.798 --> 00:06:58.638
Shri Mataji: He is alright.

00:06:58.648 --> 00:06:59.878
Should be alright.

00:06:59.887 --> 00:07:02.458
Yogi: I’m wondering where he’s gone.

00:07:02.458 --> 00:07:04.658
Shri Mataji: I beg your pardon?

00:07:04.749 --> 00:07:07.689
Yogi: I would like to know whether he’ll
come.

00:07:07.713 --> 00:07:09.353
(Indistinct words)

00:07:09.388 --> 00:07:12.753
Shri Mataji (laughs): So you will see gradually
how it works.]

00:07:12.898 --> 00:07:25.943
So this Void is so important because that
is how you establish your receiving ends in

00:07:25.953 --> 00:07:30.841
your being, the five elements within you.

00:07:30.966 --> 00:07:37.386
Meaning the five elements that exist (within
you?

00:07:37.461 --> 00:07:40.951
In Sahaja Yoga, we try the other way round
stuff.

00:07:40.996 --> 00:07:43.375
Yes, I have tried it this (way?).

00:07:43.375 --> 00:07:44.736
Now, what to do?

00:07:44.736 --> 00:07:47.656
The Dharma is all ruined.

00:07:47.656 --> 00:07:50.206
It is.

00:07:50.336 --> 00:07:59.758
There is another way: all these elements are
represented in your chakras, different chakras.

00:08:02.078 --> 00:08:07.928
So why not take the Kundalini through these
chakras and enlighten the elements themselves?

00:08:08.048 --> 00:08:12.858
Even there is no Dharma in a person you can
do it.

00:08:12.858 --> 00:08:21.512
But then the Kundalini goes back to all the
places which you have missed.

00:08:21.542 --> 00:08:29.105
But if you have been to some guru and you
have bent your head before him, then the Kundalini

00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:30.495
stops at that Void.

00:08:30.505 --> 00:08:33.175
It doesn’t move, it goes here, and there,
and there.

00:08:33.205 --> 00:08:35.905
It just stops, it doesn’t go further, it’s
very difficult.

00:08:35.985 --> 00:08:39.755
You have seen the Void pulsating so badly.

00:08:39.869 --> 00:08:45.709
It just doesn’t rise, it always goes back
into that bottomless pit as you can call it.

00:08:45.849 --> 00:08:49.169
It’s always sucked into that again and again
if you have had a guru.

00:08:49.261 --> 00:08:56.023
So we try to remove the guru from your mind
by so many ways.

00:08:56.283 --> 00:09:03.663
Deny them completely, absolutely, so that
they get out of your minds.

00:09:03.748 --> 00:09:11.529
And again raise the Kundalini, and from the
innermost, the Brahma Nadi as they call it,

00:09:11.591 --> 00:09:14.389
the innermost Nadi, the Sukshma Nadi.

00:09:14.459 --> 00:09:17.049
Otherwise, you cannot reach there.

00:09:17.099 --> 00:09:20.469
From outside you go on cleansing, cleansing,
cleansing until you reach there, you find

00:09:20.669 --> 00:09:22.709
you cannot pierce through.

00:09:22.769 --> 00:09:31.671
But outside cleaning helps you in one way,
that the Brahma Nadi becomes wider, the Nadi

00:09:31.723 --> 00:09:34.221
that is in the center of Sushumna.

00:09:34.331 --> 00:09:38.932
If you – there’s less pressure then it
is a wider one so for Kundalini rising there

00:09:39.001 --> 00:09:43.891
is a better chance.

00:09:43.891 --> 00:09:53.956
But in Sahaja Yoga, the subtlest of subtlest
Kundalini we catch, and thread it microscopically

00:09:54.071 --> 00:09:58.100
inside, and take it out.

00:09:58.141 --> 00:10:05.271
And by taking it out what happens, these chakras
definitely get enlightened, they expand.

00:10:05.331 --> 00:10:08.021
That’s how we expand the Sushumna.

00:10:08.109 --> 00:10:11.631
Expanding Brahmanadi.

00:10:11.791 --> 00:10:15.951
This was – this is the trick of Sahaja Yoga.

00:10:15.951 --> 00:10:19.890
Because this cleansing is going to take too
much time as you said.

00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:25.530
The whole thing is to be cleansed out and
then it is to be released and then you have

00:10:25.625 --> 00:10:30.675
to meet some guru who has to take it.

00:10:30.675 --> 00:10:38.125
So the Sadhachar [virtue, correct action],
whatever Buddha has said, the right, the right

00:10:38.125 --> 00:10:45.850
action, the right that he has said it, is
the one that is Dharma.

00:10:45.866 --> 00:10:48.280
That’s what is described.

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:53.790
But that doesn’t work out with human beings,
it’s meant for people who are realized souls.

00:10:53.900 --> 00:11:01.111
Most of these religions are meant for realized
souls, you can find out.

00:11:01.111 --> 00:11:06.541
Actually realized souls only took to religion
before.

00:11:06.541 --> 00:11:14.001
Those who were born again, Dwijah, Brahmins,
who took to religion.

00:11:14.001 --> 00:11:22.731
But the time has come for people who are not
realized also to take to religion and to receive

00:11:22.849 --> 00:11:24.229
His blessings.

00:11:24.229 --> 00:11:34.148
Sahaja Yoga is the only way one can do it
– is to take it in the subtle-most – innermost

00:11:34.208 --> 00:11:43.968
Nadi, enlightened every chakra, increase the
size of the chakra, pierce a little bit here,

00:11:44.008 --> 00:11:50.139
then again raise the another thread, then
again the third thread, like that, go on expanding.

00:11:50.179 --> 00:11:52.969
[Aside: “This is it, you are alright.

00:11:53.074 --> 00:11:55.843
This is how it works out.

00:11:55.843 --> 00:12:01.523
In her case I did the same, I was just talking
to you.

00:12:01.593 --> 00:12:09.942
Now the main thing about Void one has to remember:
there is no rationality.

00:12:09.952 --> 00:12:19.146
It’s the hunger inside the stomach, and
hunger has no rationality: if it is hungry

00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:21.716
it will eat.

00:12:21.766 --> 00:12:28.951
It has to eat, no rationality can satisfy
it: if you are hungry you are a bhakta (seeker).

00:12:29.021 --> 00:12:37.691
And when you have spiritual hunger, the same
hunger becomes subtler and subtler, ultimately

00:12:37.731 --> 00:12:39.901
it becomes a spiritual hunger.

00:12:40.621 --> 00:12:47.181
First, the hunger starts of, say, food, of
primitive things.

00:12:47.181 --> 00:12:58.475
Then hunger for sex life, hunger for women,
hunger for men, then for power, then for money.

00:12:58.535 --> 00:13:02.835
Then the hunger for spirituality starts.

00:13:02.975 --> 00:13:14.055
When that hunger is concentrated and starts
rising without any rationality about it: you

00:13:14.055 --> 00:13:16.476
don’t know why you are seeking.

00:13:16.586 --> 00:13:25.156
Like Buddha: he had everything, he had a wife
and his father had provided him with everything.

00:13:25.156 --> 00:13:30.509
Still, his heart was seeking.

00:13:30.689 --> 00:13:33.069
Why was he seeking?

00:13:33.134 --> 00:13:39.524
It’s the hunger that is not rationality,
that isn’t explained.

00:13:39.524 --> 00:13:55.475
And then this hunger starts and the way we
quench that hunger is Dharma.

00:13:57.968 --> 00:14:02.929
The way we keep it intact is the Dharma.

00:14:02.929 --> 00:14:13.609
Supposing you are hungry: you go and eat some
poison: then it is a-dharma.

00:14:13.769 --> 00:14:18.819
I know you are hungry, but you have to eat
proper food.

00:14:20.882 --> 00:14:32.222
The knowledge about that is Dharma: what food
you must eat, what books you must read, what

00:14:32.518 --> 00:14:42.089
people you must meet, how you should live,
what should be your attitude towards others,

00:14:42.089 --> 00:14:51.139
others’ things, others’ wives, children,
daughters.

00:14:51.180 --> 00:15:00.050
Everything related to the other, all that
knowledge is Dharma.

00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:03.279
But it has no rationality.

00:15:05.119 --> 00:15:14.830
Like, you see, a man ran away, say, with somebody’s
daughter, he would say: «What’s wrong?»

00:15:14.835 --> 00:15:16.555
I cannot answer it.

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:20.295
I cannot answer it.

00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:26.405
If a man has bad relations, say, with his
own mother.

00:15:26.991 --> 00:15:29.216
He says: «What’s wrong in this?».

00:15:29.185 --> 00:15:31.875
You cannot answer, there’s no rationality.

00:15:32.255 --> 00:15:38.286
It is so, it’s a fact: «Thou shall not
commit adultery.»

00:15:39.386 --> 00:15:42.513
Christ has said even to have adulterous eyes
is wrong.

00:15:42.943 --> 00:15:46.083
But at the time, it was Christ who came in.

00:15:46.213 --> 00:15:51.283
At the Moses’ time people did not know this
eyes business, but Christ could see that and

00:15:51.384 --> 00:15:57.033
He had said it, that: «Those who have even
adulterous eyes are committing a sin.»

00:16:02.863 --> 00:16:05.343
So, how to deal with the others?

00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:15.469
Say, materialism now: we are so attached to
matter, is also problem of the Nabhi.

00:16:15.569 --> 00:16:26.000
Materialism is a false identification with
matter, all falsehood – with matter, with

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:36.582
human beings, with books, with all that is
created, is the problem of Nabhi, so you can

00:16:36.610 --> 00:16:41.610
understand how important is Nabhi.

00:16:42.592 --> 00:16:48.172
And the one that prescribes it, is the Dharma,
is the Guru.

00:16:48.252 --> 00:16:53.495
They did not come like Me to convince you
and argue out with you.

00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:55.800
They said: «Thou shalt not…».

00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:57.640
That’s a commandment.

00:16:57.640 --> 00:17:03.020
Commandment means there’s not to reason
why.

00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:05.820
It’s a commandment.

00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:08.400
There’s no rationality in Dharma.

00:17:08.550 --> 00:17:13.720
Now, the one who is dharmic does not think
about sin at all.

00:17:17.049 --> 00:17:19.519
Now, I’ll tell you about Myself.

00:17:19.579 --> 00:17:23.719
Say, I go to a party and they start a cabaret
dance.

00:17:23.799 --> 00:17:27.339
I do not think about it whether it is illegal
or whether it is wrong with this adharma,

00:17:27.389 --> 00:17:28.869
nothing.

00:17:28.919 --> 00:17:32.798
I do not think, but immediately I vomit.

00:17:32.909 --> 00:17:38.239
My grand-children, you see, they one day were
watching the TV and three of them came vomiting.

00:17:38.259 --> 00:17:41.809
I went and saw the TV and it was a horrid
thing going on.

00:17:41.869 --> 00:17:44.559
They just came and started vomiting.

00:17:44.629 --> 00:17:47.562
There’s no rationality about it: it is against
human sustenance.

00:17:47.642 --> 00:17:51.562
It is sub-human.

00:17:51.662 --> 00:17:56.212
Like animals cannot feel the dirt or filth,
we can.

00:17:54.687 --> 00:17:59.767
We feel horrible smell coming.

00:17:59.941 --> 00:18:08.140
But those who work, say, in filth cannot feel
any smell.

00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:16.935
If you go near a factory where sugar is produced
you feel terrible there, get the smell of

00:18:17.025 --> 00:18:21.805
these molasses and you can’t bear it, but
those who are working there are so much used

00:18:21.875 --> 00:18:24.595
to it that they cannot feel it.

00:18:24.735 --> 00:18:27.813
Those who live in sin cannot feel the sin
after some time, they become insensitive to

00:18:27.855 --> 00:18:28.855
it.

00:18:30.413 --> 00:18:31.793
But sin is a sin.

00:18:33.787 --> 00:18:37.057
So the insensitivity when we develop within
ourselves we become adharmic.

00:18:37.137 --> 00:18:40.477
When we are sensitive about it, we are dharmic.

00:18:40.607 --> 00:18:50.677
On the left-hand side, the intuition about
it, the auspiciousness of it – is the thing

00:18:50.677 --> 00:18:53.587
that one has to learn, the auspiciousness.

00:18:53.657 --> 00:18:58.797
A housewife is to be respected, honoured and
comforted because it is auspicious.

00:18:58.797 --> 00:19:01.756
A wife has to be respectable.

00:19:01.756 --> 00:19:08.912
A housewife doesn’t – It doesn’t look
nice for a housewife, you see, to be dressed

00:19:08.972 --> 00:19:11.621
in a funny way.

00:19:11.661 --> 00:19:17.401
Once a chief cabinet secretary from India,
his wife had come and she used to think she

00:19:17.412 --> 00:19:20.050
is very young and smart or something.

00:19:20.062 --> 00:19:24.102
She was wearing those tight jeans and things
like that, you see.

00:19:24.032 --> 00:19:27.142
And the poor husband, you see, looked at this
side, that side.

00:19:27.202 --> 00:19:29.282
He didn’t know what to do.

00:19:29.392 --> 00:19:31.842
And she is – I mean, very big man.

00:19:31.902 --> 00:19:33.122
Alright.

00:19:33.232 --> 00:19:38.257
And she came down in London, she was thinking:
«Oh, she is a great, smart thing», you know.

00:19:38.417 --> 00:19:42.647
And they were invited to a dinner – it’s
a real thing, you know, real thing that has

00:19:42.711 --> 00:19:43.711
happened.

00:19:43.711 --> 00:19:47.181
And when this man was to go from somewhere
and she had to go from somewhere else.

00:19:47.351 --> 00:19:49.651
So, when he went there, he said: «Where is
my wife?»

00:19:49.661 --> 00:19:52.371
Said: «She hasn’t come right now.»

00:19:52.391 --> 00:19:55.251
He said: «No, she was to come, she is not
like that, she is much smarter than me, she

00:19:55.241 --> 00:19:56.611
must have arrived.»

00:19:56.654 --> 00:19:59.364
He looked around, he couldn’t find her.

00:19:59.404 --> 00:20:05.201
And there was a lady standing, he said: «There’s
your secretary has come, she is standing there.»

00:20:05.264 --> 00:20:10.665
And he didn’t know what to say because she
really looked like a secretary and not his

00:20:10.733 --> 00:20:11.733
wife.

00:20:14.345 --> 00:20:21.135
So the housewife has to be dignified and respectable
and she is to be respected.

00:20:22.965 --> 00:20:25.437
It’s the part of that auspiciousness.

00:20:27.277 --> 00:20:35.677
And the wife, that essence of a wife is the
governing…

00:20:35.677 --> 00:20:44.308
So you can imagine those women who used to
stand for lib and all that and those who tried

00:20:44.358 --> 00:20:48.648
to sort of say that: «Why should we be respectable
if the husband is not if he is carrying on

00:20:49.226 --> 00:20:54.136
with the other women I should also carry on
with the other men.»

00:20:54.266 --> 00:21:01.646
You must know that you are withholding that
great position in the stomach, on the left-hand

00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:04.041
side of every human being.

00:21:04.191 --> 00:21:08.081
And that’s why the left Nabhi catches in
England so much; and in America, I think it’s

00:21:08.181 --> 00:21:11.181
missing already (laughter).

00:21:18.081 --> 00:21:25.843
So, that is to ask to, say, to a man you see,
who is so developed, and is so, he thinks

00:21:25.931 --> 00:21:32.035
no ends of himself, you see, and the civilization
where work is so important and money is even

00:21:32.095 --> 00:21:35.445
more important than work is.

00:21:35.555 --> 00:21:41.155
To him, it’s silly to think that a housewife’s
respectability is so important in the play

00:21:41.195 --> 00:21:42.855
of the universe.

00:21:42.855 --> 00:21:44.515
Yes, it is.

00:21:44.515 --> 00:21:49.570
Where the women become dis-respectable the
whole – you see, that’s the breaking point

00:21:49.585 --> 00:21:50.860
of the society.

00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:54.110
There the human beings will start destroying.

00:21:54.165 --> 00:21:57.425
That’s the real atomic bomb you have got.

00:22:00.956 --> 00:22:03.466
But it is so, I cannot rationalize it, it
is made like that.

00:22:11.056 --> 00:22:13.896
All the Gurus have said: «You should not
drink.»

00:22:13.926 --> 00:22:15.346
Even Moses.

00:22:17.218 --> 00:22:27.408
Every one of them has said: «You cannot drink»,
means take any kind of ann alcohol or any

00:22:27.408 --> 00:22:30.825
things that will take away your awareness,
because that is the place of your awareness.

00:22:31.010 --> 00:22:38.685
In the sense that whatever goes wrong here
spoils your attention, and if your attention

00:22:38.755 --> 00:22:41.885
is spoiled, your awareness is spoiled.

00:22:41.947 --> 00:22:45.936
The attention is in here.

00:22:46.026 --> 00:22:49.116
The attention is in the stomach, in the Void.

00:22:49.267 --> 00:22:52.067
So, how important is your attention.

00:22:52.067 --> 00:22:55.897
Wherever you put your attention, that works
out.

00:22:55.897 --> 00:23:00.377
When you are realized, then your attention
is realized.

00:23:00.377 --> 00:23:10.983
Wherever you put your attention it works like
a spade, it works like a sword, it works like

00:23:11.028 --> 00:23:21.968
a loving hand, it works like a kiss, it works
like a comforting heart.

00:23:21.968 --> 00:23:25.403
It is an enlightened attention in your stomach.

00:23:25.533 --> 00:23:32.013
You see, the mother has the child in the stomach,
in the womb, and how it looks after the child,

00:23:32.076 --> 00:23:35.326
a little baby, how it protects.

00:23:35.326 --> 00:23:50.736
All that is there is given to us through our
Gurus, our own beings which are our masters,

00:23:50.986 --> 00:23:52.846
who teach us.

00:23:53.172 --> 00:23:56.522
The stomach teaches you, your stomach is your
Guru.

00:23:56.522 --> 00:24:06.242
Amoeba became a human being through the stomach
only, through the hunger it had.

00:24:06.222 --> 00:24:09.987
If it did not have hunger it would not have
evolved.

00:24:10.032 --> 00:24:12.702
And the hunger teaches you.

00:24:12.812 --> 00:24:18.902
And when you learn it properly, then you become
the Guru yourself of the whole world and the

00:24:18.952 --> 00:24:19.952
universe.

00:24:27.977 --> 00:24:34.517
Void, that’s why is very important, and
when you have had bad gurus, you have read

00:24:34.517 --> 00:24:42.737
horrible books, accepted them as facts and
truths, then your Void gets spoiled, your

00:24:42.737 --> 00:24:45.259
attention gets spoiled.

00:24:47.419 --> 00:24:51.759
It goes to wrong things.

00:24:51.759 --> 00:25:01.249
Attention, when it works through your eyes,
can also go to wrong things.

00:25:01.249 --> 00:25:07.771
Everywhere wherever the attention moves it
can do wrong things if it is adharmic.

00:25:07.941 --> 00:25:12.171
But as I said there is no rationality about
it.

00:25:12.201 --> 00:25:14.091
Dharma is to be accepted.

00:25:15.922 --> 00:25:17.671
You cannot rationalize it.

00:25:18.801 --> 00:25:27.541
To a point, you may try, but how far it harms
you, you cannot rationalize.

00:25:30.101 --> 00:25:33.637
And then the curses of Divine comes on you.

00:25:39.117 --> 00:25:48.992
Any kind of fanaticism or identification with
one ideal – like Muslims thinking they are

00:25:49.017 --> 00:25:50.017
Muslims.

00:25:51.548 --> 00:25:53.472
They are adharmic.

00:25:53.528 --> 00:25:56.128
They are not dharmic.

00:25:56.128 --> 00:26:03.098
Dharma is that you have to respect all the
religions.

00:26:03.098 --> 00:26:08.538
It is a sin not to respect any incarnation.

00:26:08.538 --> 00:26:18.384
It is a sin not to respect any religion.

00:26:18.504 --> 00:26:26.674
And to identify with one and denounce the
other.

00:26:26.674 --> 00:26:34.294
So, give up all these false dharmas and come
to that one Dharma which evolves you, which

00:26:34.294 --> 00:26:45.494
gives you light by which you can see the oneness
among all these religions.

00:26:45.494 --> 00:26:53.105
As I’ve said it before, that they are like
beautiful flowers on one tree nurtured by

00:26:53.165 --> 00:27:01.874
one sap, adorned by one tree; but fools take
the flowers out, say that “These are our

00:27:01.874 --> 00:27:05.324
flowers” and kill them.

00:27:05.324 --> 00:27:11.540
And when these flowers die, ugliness becomes
the so-called religions.

00:27:15.902 --> 00:27:22.862
So, in essences, respect all the religions,
and all the incarnations.

00:27:19.102 --> 00:27:32.472
Fanaticism is absolutely against the Nabhi
and against the Void because the whole balance

00:27:32.524 --> 00:27:34.754
of your Void is to be kept.

00:27:34.754 --> 00:27:40.739
In a very subtle and subtler form, you will
be sticking onto it.

00:27:40.799 --> 00:27:45.579
Say, you are born a Christian, so whatever
you may try you cannot get out of this feeling

00:27:45.624 --> 00:27:47.859
that “We are Christians”.

00:27:46.650 --> 00:27:53.646
You’ll have much more respect for Mary in
heart than for, say, Lakshmi.

00:27:53.926 --> 00:28:03.996
While you are a Hindu, you will have much
more respect for Radha than for Mary.

00:28:04.116 --> 00:28:09.396
That will be lingering on and lingering on.

00:28:09.396 --> 00:28:17.676
When you develop that balance alright, then
you are dharmic.

00:28:17.676 --> 00:28:24.976
That balancing has to be done.

00:28:24.976 --> 00:28:31.026
So one realization is within you like this.

00:28:31.026 --> 00:28:40.496
And one realization is this way, among you,
and this is Dharma.

00:28:40.496 --> 00:28:49.257
Among all of you, there has to be another
integration, a complete integration of understanding.

00:28:49.387 --> 00:28:58.457
Whether you are white, black or red, whether
a Hindu, Christian or anything, you must know

00:28:58.532 --> 00:29:06.012
that there is only one way that is the living
way of evolution and that there is only one

00:29:06.062 --> 00:29:07.062
God.

00:29:07.062 --> 00:29:16.782
And all of them are aspects of the same God,
and there is no quarreling among them.

00:29:16.782 --> 00:29:18.472
Why are you quarreling?

00:29:18.472 --> 00:29:23.232
This goes against the Void.

00:29:23.232 --> 00:29:28.582
Complete integration works out in the stomach.

00:29:28.582 --> 00:29:38.672
And when you are completely integrated, you’ll
be surprised, rationality drops out.

00:29:38.822 --> 00:29:42.362
Automatically it drops out.

00:29:42.362 --> 00:29:47.073
Rationality keeps disintegration because if
your heart says something, rationality says:

00:29:47.133 --> 00:29:50.143
«No, it’s not right.».

00:29:50.143 --> 00:30:01.643
But, if you take out your rationality there
and just see for yourself, then wisdom comes

00:30:01.643 --> 00:30:08.213
in and you just do it whatever is wise and
good for your spirituality.

00:30:19.022 --> 00:30:21.782
[Aside: “How are you now?

00:30:21.782 --> 00:30:25.162
It’s better, it’s working out”.]

00:30:25.162 --> 00:30:29.365
So, Void we use in Sahaja Yoga in many ways.

00:30:29.667 --> 00:30:36.547
First of all, we have to, first of all, see
the Void of a person, how he has got the Void.

00:30:36.657 --> 00:30:40.317
You can see it very easily because it might
be pulsating.

00:30:40.487 --> 00:30:44.985
Maybe not be in your presence, I don’t know,
but in My presence it does.

00:30:45.035 --> 00:30:47.705
But immediately you can feel the Void.

00:30:47.766 --> 00:30:51.105
The Void you feel on here, or on here.

00:30:51.275 --> 00:30:55.925
Now, just see these are the bases of all the
chakras.

00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:59.725
You feel the Void here, or here.

00:30:59.825 --> 00:31:05.809
Basis of all the chakras you can feel, so
you can understand how important is Void.

00:31:05.899 --> 00:31:11.849
Now, if it is catching here anywhere, or catching
over here, you see, then you have to ask the

00:31:11.919 --> 00:31:23.989
questions about these various points: whether
he is a materialist, whether he is a fanatic.

00:31:24.071 --> 00:31:27.607
But these questions you cannot ask that directly,
because if I say: «Are you a fanatic?»,

00:31:27.667 --> 00:31:30.117
he’ll hit Me hard.

00:31:30.117 --> 00:31:31.117
[Laughter]

00:31:33.477 --> 00:31:37.587
You have to be very, very clever about it.

00:31:37.937 --> 00:31:42.880
Now, how to ask a person whether you are a
fanatic or not?

00:31:42.980 --> 00:31:45.410
Very easy.

00:31:45.510 --> 00:31:47.640
Say, he
is a Muslim.

00:31:47.695 --> 00:31:55.185
So, you just ask him to put your hand, saying
that: «Should I put some Kumkum on your head?»

00:31:55.405 --> 00:32:02.736
So his fanaticism will come out immediately:
«I can’t do this!»

00:32:02.856 --> 00:32:10.536
If he is a Christian then you just ask him:
«Can you put a Swastika on your hand?»

00:32:11.926 --> 00:32:13.806
Cross he’ll accept.

00:32:13.806 --> 00:32:17.786
Swastika: «No, I’m not Hitler!»

00:32:17.786 --> 00:32:18.767
(Laughter)

00:32:18.817 --> 00:32:24.577
That’s how you can make it out whether he
is open-minded or not, by suggesting things

00:32:24.552 --> 00:32:25.447
like this.

00:32:25.922 --> 00:32:27.902
So then he comes out with his fanaticism.

00:32:27.952 --> 00:32:29.652
Then what do you do?

00:32:29.697 --> 00:32:32.392
You do not condemn him as fanatic, no.

00:32:32.422 --> 00:32:34.412
That won’t be Sahaja style.

00:32:34.552 --> 00:32:36.932
You say: «Alright, alright I’ve got it.

00:32:37.006 --> 00:32:39.732
The cross, will that be alright?

00:32:39.822 --> 00:32:41.582
Alright, take the cross.

00:32:41.682 --> 00:32:45.352
Now, if I say that cross was first Swastika
then it became cross, will you be angry?»

00:32:45.452 --> 00:32:49.879
Gradually it will work out.

00:32:49.989 --> 00:32:56.250
But if he is a fanatic you go outside and
tell Mohammad Sahib to beat him nicely.

00:32:56.339 --> 00:32:58.479
So He’ll do the job.

00:32:58.559 --> 00:33:02.529
Shoebeating is very necessary for all the
fanatics.

00:33:02.599 --> 00:33:05.419
Nice shoebeating.

00:33:05.489 --> 00:33:11.179
But fanatics are one of the most difficult.

00:33:11.289 --> 00:33:14.619
Then those who have been to other gurus also
will be showing up.

00:33:14.693 --> 00:33:18.639
These days you don’t get fanatics so many
who’d come to Sahaja Yoga.

00:33:18.749 --> 00:33:24.269
Mostly they are guru-bitten (Shri Mataji laughs).

00:33:24.229 --> 00:33:28.633
You see, there are frostbitten people, there
are guru-bitten also (She laughs).

00:33:28.817 --> 00:33:32.093
I mean, you see, mostly they are guru-bitten.

00:33:32.143 --> 00:33:33.783
Then you ask them: «Have you been to a guru?

00:33:33.788 --> 00:33:35.503
What your guru has done?

00:33:35.547 --> 00:33:36.593
This, that.»

00:33:36.713 --> 00:33:40.073
If you tell them sometimes they can be fanatically
attached to their gurus.

00:33:40.053 --> 00:33:41.583
Then they might be angry.

00:33:41.603 --> 00:33:43.413
They do it, but what to do?

00:33:43.387 --> 00:33:45.063
You see sometimes you have to tell them.

00:33:45.077 --> 00:33:46.077
[A ring bells – apart:

00:33:46.147 --> 00:33:47.297
Shri Mataji: It’s the food?

00:33:47.327 --> 00:33:48.757
Yogi: Yes.

00:33:48.757 --> 00:33:50.507
Yogi: Yes, Shri Mataji.

00:33:50.558 --> 00:33:55.007
Shri Mataji: It’s good they are looking
after the food very nicely.

00:33:55.072 --> 00:33:58.762
(Laughter) Otherwise, if you have to cook
also, then all your attention is there.

00:33:58.822 --> 00:34:01.612
So, much better than your ashram.

00:34:01.642 --> 00:34:03.422
(Laughter)

00:34:03.512 --> 00:34:04.452
Yogi: Agreed!

00:34:04.552 --> 00:34:07.832
Shri Mataji: No headache, nothing, you are
having a nice time here and their food is

00:34:07.927 --> 00:34:11.107
ready, now serve, come along, have your food.

00:34:11.147 --> 00:34:13.297
Much better than your ashram.

00:34:13.353 --> 00:34:16.533
So, the right time, we are talking about Void.

00:34:16.638 --> 00:34:19.828
(Laughter) Alright.

00:34:19.828 --> 00:34:24.618
I’ll sit here –

00:34:28.618 --> 00:34:33.578
(Yogi speaks: “All our hunger has been satisfied
today."

00:34:33.638 --> 00:34:35.248
Shri Mataji laughs)

00:34:35.204 --> 00:34:38.504
Shri Mataji: Yes, make the food also dharmic
and then eat it.

00:34:38.574 --> 00:34:39.104
Good.

00:34:39.165 --> 00:34:40.555
How are you now?

00:34:40.609 --> 00:34:41.609
Better?

00:34:41.609 --> 00:34:42.819
Yogini: Yes!

00:34:42.819 --> 00:34:43.949
Shri Mataji: Yes!

00:34:44.039 --> 00:34:47.885
This will do good to many because so many
have had this problem with guru business.

00:34:48.055 --> 00:34:49.389
How are you now?

00:34:49.445 --> 00:34:50.349
It’s good…]

00:34:50.375 --> 00:34:51.729
[Tape interruption]

00:34:51.789 --> 00:34:55.699
It’s such a wide subject that I cannot cover
it in one lecture, you’ll require many more;

00:34:55.789 --> 00:35:04.069
but the most important thing about Void is
that that once you are enlightened, you become

00:35:04.139 --> 00:35:05.879
dharmic yourself.

00:35:05.909 --> 00:35:10.659
The Dharma starts flowing through your hand.

00:35:10.734 --> 00:35:17.314
These vibrations have a capacity to establish
Dharma.

00:35:17.314 --> 00:35:22.821
So, when you put your hands now towards the
five elements, say you put your hands towards

00:35:22.831 --> 00:35:29.521
the water, or you put your hand in the water
– the water gets enlighted, vibrated.

00:35:29.751 --> 00:35:36.511
Then if somebody takes that water, it will
establish Dharma into that person.

00:35:36.607 --> 00:35:41.947
Supposing somebody is a drunkard, now you
put this vibrated water to him, give him to

00:35:42.011 --> 00:35:43.011
drink.

00:35:43.011 --> 00:35:45.977
He’ll feel nauseated after drinks.

00:35:46.021 --> 00:35:49.657
He’ll throw away the drinks, then he will
stop.

00:35:49.737 --> 00:35:54.527
Some of you have noticed that when you came
to Me first you felt a terrible nausea within

00:35:54.611 --> 00:35:59.797
you and you felt like vomiting, sometimes
you felt uneasy, you see.

00:35:59.837 --> 00:36:07.287
So these vibrations through the water now
pass into your stomach and they establish

00:36:07.352 --> 00:36:10.612
Dharma there, the proper relationship.

00:36:10.677 --> 00:36:17.992
It so happens that if you go on taking this
water, the right-side is that physically you

00:36:18.032 --> 00:36:24.152
feel alright, and the water can give you such
a power that you will never get cancer of

00:36:24.172 --> 00:36:29.062
the stomach, never get any trouble with the
stomach.

00:36:29.097 --> 00:36:36.707
But left-side side it has greater power, this
water, that it cleanses you – your sins

00:36:36.707 --> 00:36:42.857
– and puts your attention, fixes it up on
Dharma.

00:36:42.857 --> 00:36:48.073
So, your attention doesn’t do – you are
not tempted, that’s how you have seen people

00:36:48.108 --> 00:36:52.218
who come to Sahaja Yoga can give up drinks
easily.

00:36:52.218 --> 00:36:56.013
Because it turns your attention towards Dharma.

00:36:56.573 --> 00:37:00.513
Then if you want to take drinks you just don’t
feel like after some time.

00:37:00.579 --> 00:37:04.509
You feel like vomiting, you feel like headache,
and all that.

00:37:04.554 --> 00:37:06.419
And it happens so easily.

00:37:06.452 --> 00:37:10.179
Now we know somebody’s reaction – he gave
up with all his drinking in no time.

00:37:10.399 --> 00:37:15.159
Otherwise, it’s not possible to do it, but
because of this happening in the stomach,

00:37:15.199 --> 00:37:16.989
now you cannot drink.

00:37:19.643 --> 00:37:20.643
Just imagine.

00:37:20.643 --> 00:37:30.212
This is the great thing about Void is that
once you are enlightened you can give something

00:37:30.277 --> 00:37:32.672
to the nature.

00:37:32.722 --> 00:37:36.832
You have been drawing everything from nature
so far.

00:37:36.872 --> 00:37:39.662
First time now you start giving something
to the nature.

00:37:39.732 --> 00:37:43.561
And what you give to the nature is so nourishing
to it also.

00:37:43.561 --> 00:37:51.502
Supposing you give vibrations to, say, fruits,
or to trees, or to flowers.

00:37:51.602 --> 00:37:55.892
You will find they will be ten times more,
the growth will be much more, they will be

00:37:55.946 --> 00:37:56.946
lustrous.

00:37:56.946 --> 00:38:02.152
And they will be very juicy, very tasty and
the whole atmosphere will be different.

00:38:02.352 --> 00:38:08.402
Maybe after some time these trees, if they
will be standing there, anybody will be passing

00:38:08.472 --> 00:38:13.282
that way, if he touches the tree they will
get the vibrations also from there.

00:38:13.272 --> 00:38:17.002
So maybe a tree may become a curer, something
like that.

00:38:17.052 --> 00:38:22.472
All those waters and all that, we talk of
«curing water», are nothing but vibrated

00:38:22.562 --> 00:38:23.732
waters.

00:38:23.862 --> 00:38:25.172
They are vibrated.

00:38:25.243 --> 00:38:29.790
So, if the vibrated water goes inside, you
get cured.

00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:35.410
So, this is on the left-hand side it works,
that it establishes your religion within you.

00:38:37.517 --> 00:38:44.400
All the problems you have had is all completely
cleansed out by that.

00:38:44.690 --> 00:38:48.070
In the same way, if you enlighten a light
– now here [Mother turns to the flame of

00:38:48.115 --> 00:38:51.420
the candle] you have seen so many times just
here, what you can enlighten a light is.

00:38:51.515 --> 00:38:55.570
So it starts going, see, both are there but
this one is working as if…

00:38:55.630 --> 00:39:02.040
It’s actually also going vertically, but
this and this you have taking out the black.

00:39:02.110 --> 00:39:03.760
It is because it is enlightened.

00:39:03.790 --> 00:39:05.450
That is also enlightened, no?

00:39:05.450 --> 00:39:07.050
So it may also take out.

00:39:07.134 --> 00:39:09.494
But this one actually in the hand is taking
away the…

00:39:10.510 --> 00:39:15.520
If you see these lights you can feel they
are like pulled out like this.

00:39:15.825 --> 00:39:19.500
As if, you see, the realized lights are pulled
out like this, straight.

00:39:19.781 --> 00:39:28.591
And, I’ve been to some of these churches
where they have these lights, and as soon

00:39:28.571 --> 00:39:31.431
as I enter inside they all go “kakakakakak”.

00:39:31.451 --> 00:39:32.231
(Shri Mataji laughs)

00:39:32.296 --> 00:39:36.161
It is interesting to see how they start suddenly
glowing like that.

00:39:36.221 --> 00:39:40.971
But people do not notice it because they do
not understand how, why it has happened, but

00:39:40.961 --> 00:39:42.851
you can understand that.

00:39:43.046 --> 00:39:45.857
So, if you put the light, enlightened light
–

00:39:45.928 --> 00:39:50.207
Say, yesterday – the other day we had that
Havana, is the enlightened light.

00:39:50.411 --> 00:39:54.047
Havana we had made it enlightened, Jagrut.

00:39:55.017 --> 00:40:00.977
Then whatever we put into it, you see, our
badhas and everything, it burned whatever

00:40:01.017 --> 00:40:02.867
we wanted to burn away.

00:40:02.943 --> 00:40:11.512
What is the beauty of fire is that, say, if
you have some mixed-up gold and you put it

00:40:11.542 --> 00:40:17.602
to fire, you will find the gold will be separated
and the filth or dirt or whatever is inside

00:40:17.637 --> 00:40:18.992
it will be separated.

00:40:19.162 --> 00:40:24.582
So, this quality, which is the right-hand
side quality of the fire is, becomes in the

00:40:24.597 --> 00:40:31.947
left-hand side is that when you go near such
a fire, or you use such a fire or a light,

00:40:32.144 --> 00:40:41.524
then what happens that whatever is unwanted
in you is burned away, and you get the pure

00:40:41.572 --> 00:40:42.382
thing.

00:40:42.439 --> 00:40:43.439
So it purifies.

00:40:45.166 --> 00:40:50.700
Fire is a purifier and it is a melter, it
melts your heart.

00:40:50.786 --> 00:40:54.610
This fire melts your heart and you feel the
compassion.

00:40:54.700 --> 00:41:01.680
So that’s how every element can be enlightened,
and this is the work done in the Void by your

00:41:01.700 --> 00:41:02.700
Kundalini.

00:41:02.925 --> 00:41:10.035
Kundalini goes to various places and She enlightens
all these elements in your stomach.

00:41:10.230 --> 00:41:15.115
In the stomach, the basic principle is of
water.

00:41:15.275 --> 00:41:22.555
The Void is covered with water, and in the
water there is salt, and the salt is nothing

00:41:22.579 --> 00:41:24.059
but is the Dharma.

00:41:24.964 --> 00:41:26.709
Is the Dharma, the salt.

00:41:27.741 --> 00:41:34.509
That’s why when we give you salt what happens
– the salt that is vibrated goes and helps

00:41:34.539 --> 00:41:36.249
you in the stomach.

00:41:36.264 --> 00:41:47.044
And salt shows its own nature there by absorbing
all that is in you which is, we can say, is

00:41:47.070 --> 00:41:48.164
mobile there.

00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:55.114
A person supposing is, has got a cancer problem,
then he should take salt.

00:41:55.245 --> 00:41:59.325
If he has a right-hand side problem, he should,
she should just take sugar.

00:41:59.402 --> 00:42:05.905
So these are the two qualities, you see, the
five of dharmas are done by salt and five

00:42:06.045 --> 00:42:07.285
by sugar.

00:42:07.385 --> 00:42:11.235
And these are the best solvents in the water,
as you know.

00:42:11.318 --> 00:42:19.448
So, all these three things put together: water,
then salt, then the sugar, they solve the

00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:21.000
problem of the Void.

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:24.020
That’s why we use these two things.

00:42:24.020 --> 00:42:27.440
If you remember Christ has said that “you
are the salt”.

00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:33.361
That means you are the Gurus.

00:42:33.430 --> 00:42:35.301
Salt is the Guru.

00:42:35.850 --> 00:42:38.711
That’s why he said: «You are the salt.»

00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:40.711
Because you are the Gurus.

00:42:40.761 --> 00:42:43.151
And salt dissolves into water.

00:42:43.411 --> 00:42:46.011
Water is the Dharma.

00:42:46.223 --> 00:42:50.141
They are the absorbers – (a noise covers
some words… probably “salt”) always

00:42:50.163 --> 00:42:52.121
has a water of crystallization.

00:42:52.341 --> 00:42:57.251
They, it cannot exist without, the salt cannot
exist without water.

00:42:57.315 --> 00:43:00.931
So, the water and salt put together means
ocean.

00:43:01.045 --> 00:43:03.265
So Void is the ocean within us.

00:43:03.389 --> 00:43:06.248
That’s why it is called as Sagara.

00:43:06.248 --> 00:43:10.160
That means all the oceans of the world are
in our stomach.

00:43:10.559 --> 00:43:15.150
And if you want to hear them sometimes, you
can put your thumb in my ears and you can

00:43:15.180 --> 00:43:18.860
hear it coming (as a sound?

00:43:19.120 --> 00:43:20.939
Indistinct), you can hear it.

00:43:21.159 --> 00:43:30.279
So this is all the time this ocean is churned
and out of it comes out all that is good,

00:43:30.419 --> 00:43:38.843
and whatever is bad is burnt away, or washed
away, or made to – with the air – it is

00:43:38.349 --> 00:43:53.666
So the air element is also there, air element
that we see all around.

00:43:38.820 --> 00:43:43.863
made to be swept off.

00:43:53.701 --> 00:44:01.286
[Recording cut] … so the vibrated air is
a very important thing and it helps a lot.

00:44:01.552 --> 00:44:02.552
[Recording cut]

00:44:02.856 --> 00:44:09.386
So I’ve talked to you about all the four,
but the fifth one is Akasha, it’s the ether,

00:44:09.571 --> 00:44:10.571
you can say.

00:44:16.660 --> 00:44:21.521
That works out when you are a realized soul.

00:44:21.607 --> 00:44:25.101
Then you, you also vibrate the Ether.

00:44:26.291 --> 00:44:31.975
That’s how our main collective work is done,
through the Ether, you see.

00:44:32.351 --> 00:44:39.484
Now, supposing I want that you should get
a proper seat – “Whether you are going

00:44:39.589 --> 00:44:44.373
or something, alright, take a seat, alright”
– anything materialistic you can say, or

00:44:44.538 --> 00:44:47.763
My chair how do you down there, how will this…

00:44:47.946 --> 00:44:51.913
I have to just worry about it, immediately
[Shri Mataji snaps Her fingers] the orders

00:44:52.243 --> 00:44:53.692
are sent, alright?

00:44:53.745 --> 00:45:00.372
So, Saint Michael and Saint Gabriel, both
of them say: «Now what should we do?

00:45:00.441 --> 00:45:02.542
We must find a proper place.»

00:45:02.642 --> 00:45:05.482
So, they take Don into consideration,

00:45:05.512 --> 00:45:09.382
then they bring him down here and find out a nice
place for him.

00:45:09.390 --> 00:45:11.152
Is all done through Ether.

00:45:11.170 --> 00:45:18.480
Ether, it becomes – when it is enlightened,
you see, then it communicates the ideas, the

00:45:18.493 --> 00:45:23.020
things which are Divine or the desires, the
Divine desires are carried out.

00:45:23.063 --> 00:45:27.500
And then you are placed into his hands, sometimes
you are surprised: «How am I here?

00:45:27.543 --> 00:45:28.830
How are you here?

00:45:28.843 --> 00:45:30.330
How do I meet you?

00:45:30.383 --> 00:45:33.550
I mean, I was not to come this side and then
now how did I come?»

00:45:33.565 --> 00:45:36.748
All these things can be done through the Ether
which…

00:45:36.870 --> 00:45:40.978
Even we get our television and everything
through Ether.

00:45:41.090 --> 00:45:52.098
But on the television, if the Ether, if you,
if you, say, enlighten it, then it will so

00:45:52.140 --> 00:45:55.940
happen, that a bad [spread?] program won’t
materialize.

00:45:56.245 --> 00:45:59.500
It won’t materialize.

00:45:59.885 --> 00:46:02.345
It can work very dynamically.

00:46:02.535 --> 00:46:05.785
You cannot imagine how these miracles take
place.

00:46:05.865 --> 00:46:11.505
And real miracles are felt, you know of course
we do feel the miracles of all the other elements,

00:46:11.565 --> 00:46:15.815
but it’s not so obvious as that of the Ether
because you are suddenly surprised: «How

00:46:15.975 --> 00:46:16.975
this?

00:46:16.975 --> 00:46:17.975
Why?»

00:46:18.207 --> 00:46:23.165
And it’s – everybody is surprised at it,
all here in in the plate you get all this.

00:46:23.217 --> 00:46:28.229
So, this is done by Ether and it is so miraculous.

00:46:28.369 --> 00:46:34.265
It is so miraculous, that it is hard to believe
that it is possible.

00:46:34.289 --> 00:46:39.419
Now, this Ether works day-time and night-time.

00:46:39.507 --> 00:46:42.909
It doesn’t take rest anywhere.

00:46:42.987 --> 00:46:47.389
It’s all the time up for us, means it is
all the time ready to work out the divine

00:46:47.461 --> 00:46:48.461
work.

00:46:48.501 --> 00:46:51.619
All the time it is ready to work out the divine
work.

00:46:51.631 --> 00:46:52.871
It doesn’t wait.

00:46:52.921 --> 00:46:59.071
It doesn’t wait for anyone to give orders
or anything; it’s just, just waiting there.

00:46:59.152 --> 00:47:05.761
As soon as it sees that this is desired, alright,
nothing is to be told, just to desire and

00:47:05.791 --> 00:47:08.971
you say that: «Oh, what will be happening
to such and such person?»

00:47:09.041 --> 00:47:10.551
Finished, it’s done.

00:47:10.591 --> 00:47:13.001
It has been transmitted.

00:47:13.201 --> 00:47:20.631
The same Ether that transmits the – what
you call?

00:47:20.750 --> 00:47:26.581
– the air transmissions which you receive
on the radios, radio transmissions.

00:47:26.779 --> 00:47:30.189
The same one, when enlightened, does all this
job.

00:47:32.064 --> 00:47:33.999
He works it out, everything.

00:47:34.504 --> 00:47:37.579
Everything that you want it works it out.

00:47:37.704 --> 00:47:40.919
And there’s how the angels show their…

00:47:41.124 --> 00:47:46.859
[Shri Mataji searches the word in Marathi]
their miraculous feats.

00:47:48.514 --> 00:47:55.464
But it is worth noticing all that and watching
it, and witnessing it and noting it down:

00:47:55.578 --> 00:47:58.584
«Oh, how it helped and how it worked out!»

00:47:58.658 --> 00:48:05.124
And it also Ether when enlightened brings
people closer to Divine power.

00:48:05.198 --> 00:48:07.214
It arranges and organizes.

00:48:09.079 --> 00:48:17.579
But now, one would ask what is the necessity
for God to have such complicated methods of

00:48:17.599 --> 00:48:21.219
“enlightening the matter”?

00:48:21.759 --> 00:48:26.309
Why not it has already the enlightened matter?

00:48:26.339 --> 00:48:32.599
It’s the question one should ask, I mean,
I’m asking as you people are there, so I’m

00:48:32.649 --> 00:48:33.649
asking you.

00:48:33.812 --> 00:48:35.419
Let’s see the answer.

00:48:35.572 --> 00:48:37.112
That’s your problem.

00:48:37.232 --> 00:48:42.302
Yesterday I told you to say that “I’m
not guilty”.

00:48:42.410 --> 00:48:51.422
It’s just a joke you are enjoying, you are
just playing games with yourself when you

00:48:51.430 --> 00:48:52.430
say that.

00:48:52.470 --> 00:48:57.950
Because you like to play such terrible jokes
with yourself.

00:48:58.064 --> 00:49:00.280
Don’t say that you are guilty.

00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:01.360
At all.

00:49:01.441 --> 00:49:08.321
By saying that, you see, you are trying to
enjoy a sort of a sadism against yourself.

00:49:08.316 --> 00:49:10.891
You are against yourself.

00:49:11.046 --> 00:49:14.351
Self that is your Spirit.

00:49:17.786 --> 00:49:21.586
The yogi: That’s what it feels like, it
feels like…

00:49:21.606 --> 00:49:22.606
(Indistinct words)

00:49:22.886 --> 00:49:25.306
Shri Mataji: That’s not a good thing.

00:49:25.346 --> 00:49:32.196
That’s not what is wanted, is not what is
desired, so just don’t play on them.

00:49:32.796 --> 00:49:36.046
Whatever are your moods are not correct.

00:49:36.176 --> 00:49:38.246
They should not be there.

00:49:42.265 --> 00:49:45.356
By your moods, you are lost.

00:49:46.585 --> 00:49:52.966
Sometimes you get this mood, sometimes you
get another mood of aggression.

00:49:53.885 --> 00:49:56.885
Whether is a temper or something like that.

00:49:57.027 --> 00:49:59.895
And sometimes you get into this kind of an
apologetic mood.

00:49:59.947 --> 00:50:01.867
Both are useless, absolutely useless.

00:50:01.867 --> 00:50:04.425
Just throw them away.

00:50:05.029 --> 00:50:06.767
Why should we do it?

00:50:22.444 --> 00:50:24.737
Both are mythical.

00:50:31.864 --> 00:50:35.224
– (The yogi speaks) – Yes, this positivity
also – this so-called positivity means aggression

00:50:35.240 --> 00:50:39.414
on others, you start showing your aggression
on others.

00:50:39.654 --> 00:50:41.914
You can aggress others also.

00:50:43.169 --> 00:50:45.029
That’s even worse.

00:50:49.144 --> 00:50:53.004
– (The yogi speaks) – That’s, that’s,
that’s, that’s the thing I was saying.

00:50:53.454 --> 00:50:56.874
Be joyous, be happy for what God has given
you.

00:50:59.054 --> 00:51:01.550
Watch the birds in the morning time.

00:51:04.423 --> 00:51:06.780
See the flowers in the morning time.

00:51:11.455 --> 00:51:14.222
What do they have?

00:51:14.495 --> 00:51:23.102
They are standing in the sun, in the rain,
they are facing the nature all the time.

00:51:23.130 --> 00:51:27.760
Imagine the delicate petals of the flowers.

00:51:31.627 --> 00:51:37.097
Do they show any signs of negativity or of
aggression?

00:51:40.487 --> 00:51:42.507
They only emit fragrance.

00:51:43.657 --> 00:51:46.427
Till they live they will emit fragrance.

00:51:46.497 --> 00:51:49.857
When they will die, they are not bothered.

00:51:54.770 --> 00:51:59.030
Aggressive person cannot come to Sahaja Yoga,
he cannot go very far.

00:51:59.770 --> 00:52:03.170
Neither a negative person, but aggressive
cannot.

00:52:03.495 --> 00:52:04.740
He’ll drop out.

00:52:09.502 --> 00:52:12.630
Sahaja Yoga recedes from such people.

00:52:18.812 --> 00:52:25.422
You have to be humble, but you are not to
be slaves.

00:52:28.675 --> 00:52:34.765
In extremes at least one should know the difference
between the two.

00:52:35.912 --> 00:52:40.722
You see, there is extremes, say something
is very black – then you can see the white

00:52:40.757 --> 00:52:43.762
very clearly against it, isn’t it?

00:52:43.927 --> 00:52:49.017
And when you know how to move from one extreme
to another extremes, you should be able to

00:52:49.030 --> 00:52:54.607
see both the things very clearly.

00:52:56.937 --> 00:53:00.015
And that’s how you come to the center.

00:53:05.965 --> 00:53:09.635
I mean, it is for your own good to be like
that.

00:53:11.565 --> 00:53:15.335
You may say: “Yes, we understand, Mother,
but we can’t do it”.

00:53:16.715 --> 00:53:18.265
Could try.

00:53:18.712 --> 00:53:28.840
You just watch yourself and see how it works,
how your mind is working: it’s your horse

00:53:28.870 --> 00:53:31.320
and you have to master it.

00:53:32.560 --> 00:53:38.110
You are supposed to be a rider and the horse
is taking you somewhere wherever it feels

00:53:38.121 --> 00:53:45.785
like, either to negativity or to the positivity
so-called – means the aggressiveness.

00:53:45.899 --> 00:53:55.159
It’s the horse that is leading you, not
you are leading the horse.

00:53:55.179 --> 00:53:58.279
What kind of a rider it is?

00:54:01.119 --> 00:54:09.809
And the horse is like a pendulum and you are
led by it.

00:54:12.649 --> 00:54:19.330
And when you identify yourself with that horse
you think: “What to do?

00:54:19.359 --> 00:54:20.779
It is happening."

00:54:20.836 --> 00:54:22.869
You can control it.

00:54:32.312 --> 00:54:39.605
You have to tell yourself, that is to tell
your mind to behave itself.

00:54:41.540 --> 00:54:48.140
Otherwise, you people cannot go very deep
into Sahaja Yoga.

00:54:48.519 --> 00:54:50.730
You have to go much deeper.

00:54:51.215 --> 00:54:56.235
If you are worried about superficialities
you cannot go deeper.

00:55:01.465 --> 00:55:03.995
Deep down is the Truth.

00:55:04.055 --> 00:55:05.675
There lies all the joy.

00:55:10.996 --> 00:55:16.846
All the trees, all the big trees have their
roots deep down.

00:55:19.284 --> 00:55:23.596
Find out your roots: where are they?

00:55:24.384 --> 00:55:39.044
They are all embedded in your heart and in
your Spirit, not in these superficial things

00:55:39.074 --> 00:55:46.229
where your mind is moving with the wind, here
and there, just like a dead leaf.

00:55:51.259 --> 00:56:03.009
If a big train arrives, and the train is faced,
say – with a – some sort of an obstacle,

00:56:03.029 --> 00:56:05.389
it cannot stop.

00:56:05.869 --> 00:56:13.549
But if there’s a little worm and if it wants
to save itself from the train it can.

00:56:13.633 --> 00:56:17.549
It can hide itself away somewhere.

00:56:19.019 --> 00:56:20.669
You are not a worm.

00:56:20.779 --> 00:56:22.799
You are a human being.

00:56:23.571 --> 00:56:26.579
A little living thing can do that much.

00:56:28.999 --> 00:56:35.659
You are a human being and if you cannot stop
yourself from your destruction,

00:56:39.643 --> 00:56:42.099
then who can stop you?

00:56:45.523 --> 00:56:50.553
You see the nature: people live together.

00:56:50.531 --> 00:56:56.531
Tiger lives in a forest and there are many
creatures who exist, too.

00:57:01.662 --> 00:57:08.272
But if human beings cannot save themselves
with all the brain that they have, their dynamic

00:57:08.282 --> 00:57:13.882
styles you see, with all the energy that they
have, with all the discoveries that they have

00:57:13.912 --> 00:57:20.032
made, then who is going to save mankind?

00:57:24.006 --> 00:57:31.266
Either you aggress on others or you kill yourself:
and then what should Mataji do?

00:57:31.290 --> 00:57:38.040
Or what should anyone do under these circumstances
– but to make you face it?

00:57:47.107 --> 00:57:51.937
In Sahaja Yoga, you can face it very clearly.

00:57:52.606 --> 00:57:57.167
You can see others doing it also, but first,
you must see it in yourself.

00:57:57.387 --> 00:58:01.727
Unless and until you see it in yourself what
you are doing to yourself, you cannot see

00:58:01.720 --> 00:58:02.720
in others.

00:58:08.893 --> 00:58:12.043
When I say “you see it in yourself” you
become self-centered.

00:58:12.053 --> 00:58:14.933
I mean, anything You say can be twisted.

00:58:15.973 --> 00:58:20.793
When I say “you see it in yourself”, that
means you detach yourself and see in yourself:

00:58:20.805 --> 00:58:22.583
what is your mind doing?

00:58:22.742 --> 00:58:27.455
That’s how you can love others also that
they are doing the same.

00:58:28.925 --> 00:58:34.505
Like a person, say, is fond of good food all
the time.

00:58:35.680 --> 00:58:40.570
If he can see that he is hankering after good
food all the time, he is thinking about good

00:58:40.600 --> 00:58:44.560
food, his mind is working like that – if
he can see that he can correct it also.

00:58:44.604 --> 00:58:45.750
If he can see it.

00:58:46.014 --> 00:58:55.704
Apart from that, when he sees somebody doing
it, he would not hate that person, but he

00:58:55.726 --> 00:58:57.844
would help him to cure.

00:58:59.260 --> 00:59:05.636
On the contrary, I have seen those who are
like that, hate the other person, make fun

00:59:05.656 --> 00:59:09.546
of the other person, while they have the same
weakness.

00:59:11.948 --> 00:59:13.648
Why, why it happens?

00:59:13.728 --> 00:59:16.778
There’s a, there’s a psychological reason.

00:59:18.268 --> 00:59:26.021
Because that point which is doing like this,
wrong in him – you hate that point in you,

00:59:26.051 --> 00:59:33.248
subconsciously, and that’s what you hate
in others; but that is consciously.

00:59:33.488 --> 00:59:39.348
If you hate that part in you consciously,
there wouldn’t be any problem.

00:59:42.118 --> 00:59:47.438
That part which is negative, the part that
is telling you all these things, the part

00:59:47.436 --> 00:59:53.511
that misleads you, the part that spoils you,
the part that covers the Self – you see

00:59:53.561 --> 01:00:04.011
– in you, if you could manage to see that
and say: “No, not that part, no."

01:00:04.045 --> 01:00:09.151
But then you start despising the rule (unclear
word).

01:00:09.201 --> 01:00:13.461
It’s a very subtle thing: either you move
from this side to that side.

01:00:13.588 --> 01:00:17.318
If I try to push you, you’ll just go like
a spring to the other end.

01:00:17.418 --> 01:00:20.108
If I try to push on that side like a spring
you go to the other end.

01:00:20.168 --> 01:00:24.438
Thing is, the basic thing is the extremes
are to be avoided.

01:00:24.688 --> 01:00:31.243
This is the basic point is: extremes to be
avoided.

01:00:34.243 --> 01:00:39.323
If you feel you are getting negative, take
your shoe and beat yourself nicely.

01:00:39.413 --> 01:00:50.462
Go out and shout or take a pillow and hit
it hard, alright?

01:00:52.115 --> 01:00:55.268
But if you are negative inside, what you will
do you will go and beat your wife or beat

01:00:55.298 --> 01:00:58.988
your husband, whatever may be the case.

01:01:07.425 --> 01:01:15.383
It’s a very simple thing for a Sahaja Yogi
to do, is to be amused about yourself.

01:01:15.551 --> 01:01:17.501
Just be amused: “Look at this Mr.

01:01:17.527 --> 01:01:19.421
So and So, now it’s me."

01:01:20.981 --> 01:01:24.551
When you start seeing yourself like that,
you see, be amused at yourself.

01:01:26.061 --> 01:01:27.641
“Ah, so now, Mr.

01:01:27.641 --> 01:01:30.521
So and So is coming up like this!

01:01:30.761 --> 01:01:34.306
Oh, come along, come along, now the vanity,
come along!

01:01:34.481 --> 01:01:37.176
I would like to see the vanity that I am.

01:01:38.676 --> 01:01:39.846
See Mr.

01:01:39.926 --> 01:01:41.576
Ego coming up.

01:01:41.616 --> 01:01:42.616
Now, here Mr.

01:01:42.606 --> 01:01:43.646
Ego stands."

01:01:43.656 --> 01:01:44.546
(Laughter)

01:01:44.536 --> 01:01:47.666
Then (Shri Mataji laughs) you will start seeing.

01:01:47.686 --> 01:01:51.436
Be amused about it in the real sense, and
you will be surprised that these things will

01:01:51.466 --> 01:01:52.466
drop out.

01:01:57.696 --> 01:02:01.786
Yogi (not clearly audible): You know this,
I mean when You observe something, and You

01:02:01.846 --> 01:02:03.496
say what You observed….

01:02:03.476 --> 01:02:04.476
(rest is indistinct).

01:02:04.509 --> 01:02:06.892
Shri Mataji: Yes, yes, of course, very much
so.

01:02:06.924 --> 01:02:07.549
Yes.

01:02:07.534 --> 01:02:08.699
Yogi: You’ll say that…

01:02:08.734 --> 01:02:09.259
Shri Mataji: Yes.

01:02:09.284 --> 01:02:10.849
Yogi: But we – but we’ll still not correct
it.

01:02:10.854 --> 01:02:11.804
What’s wrong?

01:02:11.854 --> 01:02:16.244
Shri Mataji: No, you should say: “Get away,
you take two running jumps and go away”.

01:02:24.979 --> 01:02:25.979
That will help Me.

01:02:28.485 --> 01:02:35.025
If you want to have phraseologies, I can tell
you, but I think you are much more equipped

01:02:35.028 --> 01:02:40.205
in English language with all the beautiful
humour that have – you have.

01:02:42.330 --> 01:02:44.765
Just play that on yourself, you see.

01:02:44.780 --> 01:02:51.130
Humour is a beautiful thing that you can really
play on yourself, instead of playing these

01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:58.280
melancholy songs (laughter) and foolishly
indulging into all this romantic nonsense.

01:02:58.450 --> 01:02:59.450
(Laughter)

01:03:00.970 --> 01:03:04.885
Better play some humour on yourself, sit down,
(with a deep sense of humour?

01:03:04.892 --> 01:03:08.357
– Not clear) and enjoy the humour upon yourself.

01:03:13.562 --> 01:03:15.452
It works wonders, you see.

01:03:21.102 --> 01:03:24.742
And those who know how to laugh at themselves
are the best people.

01:03:27.702 --> 01:03:28.702
[Tape cut]

01:03:29.702 --> 01:03:38.853
All that was foolish is chiselled out and
you see the beautiful joy-giving Spirit manifesting

01:03:38.863 --> 01:03:41.553
itself beautifully within you alone.

01:03:42.823 --> 01:03:47.507
And all your worries, all your problems and
all negativity and so-called aggressiveness

01:03:47.517 --> 01:03:51.417
and everything just disappears and you are
one with that.

01:03:51.617 --> 01:03:56.987
And you are seeing through (all?) that, the
brilliance that it is giving.

01:03:57.042 --> 01:04:01.092
You are seeing through and feeling the dignity
of that and the joy of it, the brilliance

01:04:01.079 --> 01:04:02.042
it is giving.

01:04:02.089 --> 01:04:05.009
Just think, if you are the sun and you come.

01:04:05.009 --> 01:04:11.499
And you see the sun coming, the rays coming
and working it out and curing and changing

01:04:11.499 --> 01:04:13.682
the colours and giving life.

01:04:13.709 --> 01:04:19.457
Imagine, how dignified you feel and how beautiful
you feel.

01:04:19.547 --> 01:04:22.487
But you don’t feel vain about it.

01:04:22.607 --> 01:04:26.637
If you are that you just don’t feel that
there’s something special about it.

01:04:26.737 --> 01:04:27.837
You just see it.

01:04:30.065 --> 01:04:33.457
Vanity comes when you don’t have something.

01:04:33.497 --> 01:04:36.435
When you have it, you say: “It’s alright,
it’s me”.

01:04:36.471 --> 01:04:37.563
It’s just flowing.

01:04:37.571 --> 01:04:42.424
It’s just watching how it’s beautifully
it is flowing.

01:04:44.764 --> 01:04:52.514
Because of scientific research in the psychological
sphere, this myth has come to us that if we

01:04:52.544 --> 01:04:56.424
try to enjoy something like that then you’ll
become proud.

01:04:56.634 --> 01:04:58.217
So you just don’t enjoy.

01:04:58.234 --> 01:05:01.637
I mean the subtotal of the whole thing is
– psychologists – is this that you don’t

01:05:01.697 --> 01:05:03.667
enjoy anything in life.

01:05:03.897 --> 01:05:08.563
It’s the subtotal it comes to (She laughs).

01:05:08.643 --> 01:05:18.099
If it is not worked with a Realized soul,
with the compassion and love and proper understanding,

01:05:18.113 --> 01:05:19.599
it amounts to that.

01:05:20.457 --> 01:05:24.289
That you just don’t enjoy anything in life.

01:05:24.939 --> 01:05:28.245
You analyze everything: this way you are bad,
that way you are bad.

01:05:28.254 --> 01:05:30.635
This way you are wrong, that way you are wrong.

01:05:30.684 --> 01:05:34.429
So you are wrong completely, you should be
finished: you are good for nothing, useless,

01:05:34.454 --> 01:05:35.489
thrown away.

01:05:35.964 --> 01:05:47.934
End up in the lunatic asylums or in some other
wretched place, which is not meant for human

01:05:47.994 --> 01:05:49.154
habitation at all.

01:05:56.474 --> 01:05:58.134
Idiotic it is, I must say.

01:05:58.324 --> 01:05:59.526
Stupid it is!

01:06:04.936 --> 01:06:14.493
It is like a – we call it in Marathi Dhoopatne,
is the thing we use for burning the incense,

01:06:14.513 --> 01:06:15.663
you see.

01:06:15.713 --> 01:06:20.926
It is hollow on this side and hollow on the
other side also because one side is the stand

01:06:20.956 --> 01:06:25.046
and the another side is where you put the
incense.

01:06:25.356 --> 01:06:29.207
So you take that Dhoopatna, and you ask for
something, you see.

01:06:29.377 --> 01:06:33.457
So something is given on this cup, you turn
it round for the other side.

01:06:33.497 --> 01:06:39.211
So, the other side you can see it, but see
this side that is filled in it’s gone, so

01:06:39.271 --> 01:06:42.891
you go to see, you want to see the other side
now, that what is left in the other one, it’s

01:06:42.921 --> 01:06:45.845
nothing is left altogether, it’s finished.

01:06:49.008 --> 01:06:55.538
So it is said that: ‘Hati Dhoopatne dene’
means this dhupatne is the thing is given

01:06:55.598 --> 01:06:56.918
to you in the hand.

01:06:56.928 --> 01:07:01.824
So first you see this side, you try to fill
the joy in the cup, alright?

01:07:01.984 --> 01:07:05.434
Then you turn it around to fill the other
side of it.

01:07:08.366 --> 01:07:12.336
But this side you receive it and the other
side is the support.

01:07:21.861 --> 01:07:25.074
So you need not go to the right, then to the
left.

01:07:25.071 --> 01:07:29.093
By the time you go to the left, the right
is over, and the right side you run up to,

01:07:29.103 --> 01:07:30.263
the left is over.

01:07:32.363 --> 01:07:34.109
Just be in the center!

01:07:41.873 --> 01:07:43.863
Push yourself in the center.

01:07:44.893 --> 01:07:45.893
Just be there.

01:07:56.167 --> 01:07:57.167
See the silence.

01:08:00.567 --> 01:08:02.265
Silence of joy crawls in.

01:08:02.257 --> 01:08:03.257
[Long silence]

01:08:10.325 --> 01:08:11.325
What’s it?

01:08:11.595 --> 01:08:12.809
What happens?

01:08:13.115 --> 01:08:17.385
[A yogi was asleep, exchanges on that, “Sleeping!”
people laugh]

01:08:20.576 --> 01:08:21.825
That’s the best!

01:08:23.236 --> 01:08:24.236
(A yogini says: “Still sleeping beautifully!”.)

01:08:24.236 --> 01:08:25.236
Eh?

01:08:39.031 --> 01:08:42.609
(More laughter and exchanges) That is the
best, this… (indistinct words).

01:08:50.054 --> 01:08:51.954
Now, any questions?

01:08:54.166 --> 01:08:57.384
Yogi: How far should we be concerned with
other people, Shri Mataji…

01:08:57.954 --> 01:08:59.514
Shri Mataji: What’s it?

01:08:59.994 --> 01:09:04.124
Yogi: (Not clearly audible) How far… should
we be concerned with other people, I mean,

01:09:04.204 --> 01:09:10.074
in a situation where are other people there
who should now better understand…

01:09:10.254 --> 01:09:11.434
Shri Mataji: Yes.

01:09:11.614 --> 01:09:15.974
Yogi: … (Unclear audio) And yet you know,
you are dependent for them on the stupid ones.

01:09:15.984 --> 01:09:16.984
(Shri Mataji laughs.

01:09:17.184 --> 01:09:20.089
The yogi continues speaking but it is not
clearly audible)

01:09:25.405 --> 01:09:26.405
Shri Mataji: Yes.

01:09:27.065 --> 01:09:33.076
I would say, you see, Regis, that you have
wisdom.

01:09:33.429 --> 01:09:35.926
All of you have your wisdom.

01:09:37.221 --> 01:09:44.186
And you tell them in a way that you carry
the [boat?] as they say.

01:09:44.843 --> 01:09:49.662
Because if you tell somebody: “You are stupid."

01:09:49.852 --> 01:09:52.882
I mean, he will make hell for Me.

01:09:54.982 --> 01:09:58.018
You’d better not do that (She laughs).

01:09:58.938 --> 01:10:00.178
Alright.

01:10:00.888 --> 01:10:05.245
Now, if you tell somebody that: “You are
very clever” when he is stupid (laughter)

01:10:05.298 --> 01:10:06.728
if he is really…

01:10:06.998 --> 01:10:11.508
Yogi (not clearly audible): When they think,
they know that, and then it’s not a stupid.

01:10:11.513 --> 01:10:14.273
Shri Mataji: Yes, they will know that, too.

01:10:14.273 --> 01:10:17.113
Because people here are very clever, you see.

01:10:17.133 --> 01:10:20.493
They are stupid in their wisdom.

01:10:20.513 --> 01:10:25.736
But understanding that – what others are
talking and all that, they know very well.

01:10:28.026 --> 01:10:32.356
So, best thing is whenever you have to work
on them, work on them secretly.

01:10:35.410 --> 01:10:39.006
Give them a bandhan, give them shoe-beating.

01:10:40.507 --> 01:10:42.766
But openly you give them tea.

01:10:43.966 --> 01:10:44.966
[Laughter.

01:10:44.966 --> 01:10:45.966
Yogi speaks…

01:10:45.966 --> 01:10:47.286
Vibrated…]

01:10:47.372 --> 01:10:51.126
Vibrated, of course, of course, of course,
of course.

01:10:52.457 --> 01:10:58.527
Keep Mataji’s photograph and a candle there
and then invite.

01:10:58.786 --> 01:10:59.786
Give them tea.

01:10:59.786 --> 01:11:01.467
Give them some chanas.

01:11:02.946 --> 01:11:06.247
You see, that’s how you have to work with
these people.

01:11:06.517 --> 01:11:10.197
Because they don’t understand this, they
may be clever.

01:11:11.447 --> 01:11:13.517
So, give them some Chanas.

01:11:14.123 --> 01:11:18.463
When they want to have some water, give them
vibrated water.
