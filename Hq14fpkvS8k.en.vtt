WEBVTT

00:01.610 --> 00:09.320
That, the central one is the sustaining power
means is the power by which we evolve, that

00:09.320 --> 00:12.309
means we get our sustenance as it is.

00:12.309 --> 00:19.870
This sustenance that we have got as a human
being when it is to be manifested on the five

00:19.870 --> 00:28.340
elements that we have within ourselves, the
source is there but we have to reach it through

00:28.340 --> 00:29.890
its different elements.

00:29.890 --> 00:41.320
When this interchange takes place or, we can
say, when we have to put this force outside,

00:41.320 --> 00:47.460
that is to be done through establishment of
Dharma on these.

00:47.460 --> 00:52.750
Like a superimposition or, you can say, the
connection.

00:52.750 --> 00:56.550
Like you can say, say there is sun.

00:56.550 --> 01:07.680
Sun is the source of light and the source
of light has (to?) come to this earth which

01:07.680 --> 01:11.680
is created out of the five elements.

01:11.680 --> 01:21.861
So the sun’s rays have to come, but when
they come inside, in this move, what do they

01:21.861 --> 01:24.250
do?

01:24.250 --> 01:29.400
They enlighten this world.

01:29.400 --> 01:34.030
But it’s only possible if there is Dharma,
means the light is there, the rays are there.

01:34.030 --> 01:37.350
The rays can be obstructed by many things.

01:37.350 --> 01:46.440
If the rays are obstructed, then there is
a-dharma.

01:46.440 --> 01:55.970
So the source of Dharma, the spreading of
Dharma and ultimately the manifestation onto

01:55.970 --> 02:00.229
the five elements is a complete thing that
is Void.

02:00.229 --> 02:04.479
This play goes on within us.

02:04.479 --> 02:10.039
Our evolutionary power which has worked from
the very beginning, from matter state, when

02:10.039 --> 02:16.870
the matter got itself as organized then we
had carbon as tetravalent, then from carbon,

02:16.870 --> 02:21.810
the life started – all this is the work
of the sustaining force.

02:21.810 --> 02:24.630
Then we became human beings.

02:24.630 --> 02:29.490
Now we have got ten dharmas within us which
we have to keep alright.

02:29.690 --> 02:32.950
These are the main ten commandments.

02:32.950 --> 02:36.490
These ten commandments we have to look after.

02:36.490 --> 02:45.533
And these are looked after by the people who
are the primordial masters, as you call them

02:45.583 --> 02:56.384
“incarnations”…(a noise covers the voice)
like Raja Janaka, like Moses, like Socrates,

02:56.384 --> 03:05.164
like Nanaka, the last one was the Shirdi Sai
Nath.

03:08.014 --> 03:13.204
This is the principle is there, is the primordial
master.

03:13.314 --> 03:21.590
Now, there is another principle that is in
there by which you receive it.

03:21.960 --> 03:28.240
This is called as the disciple principle,
the primordial disciple principle, represented

03:28.330 --> 03:40.170
by the moon and the sun, presided by Buddha
and Mahavira.

03:40.170 --> 03:51.585
So, this disciple element if it is not in
you, you cannot receive it.

03:51.695 --> 03:59.880
But when you start getting – receiving it,
this Dharma gets into you and then you become

03:59.974 --> 04:00.974
the guru.

04:00.974 --> 04:06.560
You become the guru when this is completely
sustained in you.

04:06.610 --> 04:15.031
It starts as a disciple and then ends up as
a Guru.

04:12.891 --> 04:29.771
First of all, as the human beings are, we
do not observe the first ten basic principles.

04:15.031 --> 04:18.121
This is the Void part within us.

04:29.919 --> 04:36.439
In this country for example, or in the West,
we have – we observe the five of them because

04:36.469 --> 04:40.290
of laws.

04:41.103 --> 04:49.993
In the countries like India, they observe
the rest five, because of their society.

04:50.063 --> 04:55.160
So in any way we are lacking some of them.

04:55.274 --> 04:58.900
Five are missing here or five are missing
there.

04:59.080 --> 05:03.640
This is the situation of the Dharma today.

05:03.780 --> 05:17.590
The Gurus and their disciples they do this
connection and then the matter, which is created

05:17.590 --> 05:25.543
out of five elements, get vibrated.

05:25.609 --> 05:29.079
You can enlighten the matter.

05:29.173 --> 05:34.148
When the Dharma is complete you can enlighten
the matter.

05:34.389 --> 05:43.957
The rituals that these people used which was
called as you see, do Dharmik rituals, they

05:44.167 --> 05:50.787
call them do dharmik, these are the deeds
of Dharma, is to worship, to do Puja and to

05:51.037 --> 05:58.048
pray to God and to do all these things, prayer.

05:58.578 --> 06:08.198
All these things after some time became absolutely
deadened because there was no realized soul

06:08.198 --> 06:13.564
as a Guru and no realized soul as a disciple.

06:13.716 --> 06:16.674
So it was just a joke going on, you see.

06:16.794 --> 06:18.454
It has no meaning.

06:18.554 --> 06:25.506
Supposing I tell somebody who is not realized
to give himself a bandhan, he cannot.

06:25.566 --> 06:28.226
[Aside: “He is coming back, don’t you
worry!

06:28.276 --> 06:30.656
Both of them have run away.

06:30.726 --> 06:33.966
He’ll agree then somehow.

06:33.966 --> 06:36.786
The sister is realized, the wife is realized.

06:36.850 --> 06:37.546
Born.

06:37.607 --> 06:40.607
But the husband is like that, what to do?

06:43.517 --> 06:44.927
Yogi: He came.

06:44.946 --> 06:46.397
Shri Mataji: Eh?

06:46.472 --> 06:47.592
He came in.

06:47.592 --> 06:48.792
(Yogis: “Came”.)

06:48.877 --> 06:52.167
Came, ran away half-way, he still cannot decide
which way to go.

06:52.388 --> 06:56.638
(A yogi says something)

06:56.798 --> 06:58.638
Shri Mataji: He is alright.

06:58.648 --> 06:59.878
Should be alright.

06:59.887 --> 07:02.458
Yogi: I’m wondering where he’s gone.

07:02.458 --> 07:04.658
Shri Mataji: I beg your pardon?

07:04.749 --> 07:07.689
Yogi: I would like to know whether he’ll
come.

07:07.713 --> 07:09.353
(Indistinct words)

07:09.388 --> 07:12.753
Shri Mataji (laughs): So you will see gradually
how it works.]

07:12.898 --> 07:25.943
So this Void is so important because that
is how you establish your receiving ends in

07:25.953 --> 07:30.841
your being, the five elements within you.

07:30.966 --> 07:37.386
Meaning the five elements that exist (within
you?

07:37.461 --> 07:40.951
In Sahaja Yoga, we try the other way round
stuff.

07:40.996 --> 07:43.375
Yes, I have tried it this (way?).

07:43.375 --> 07:44.736
Now, what to do?

07:44.736 --> 07:47.656
The Dharma is all ruined.

07:47.656 --> 07:50.206
It is.

07:50.336 --> 07:59.758
There is another way: all these elements are
represented in your chakras, different chakras.

08:02.078 --> 08:07.928
So why not take the Kundalini through these
chakras and enlighten the elements themselves?

08:08.048 --> 08:12.858
Even there is no Dharma in a person you can
do it.

08:12.858 --> 08:21.512
But then the Kundalini goes back to all the
places which you have missed.

08:21.542 --> 08:29.105
But if you have been to some guru and you
have bent your head before him, then the Kundalini

08:29.170 --> 08:30.495
stops at that Void.

08:30.505 --> 08:33.175
It doesn’t move, it goes here, and there,
and there.

08:33.205 --> 08:35.905
It just stops, it doesn’t go further, it’s
very difficult.

08:35.985 --> 08:39.755
You have seen the Void pulsating so badly.

08:39.869 --> 08:45.709
It just doesn’t rise, it always goes back
into that bottomless pit as you can call it.

08:45.849 --> 08:49.169
It’s always sucked into that again and again
if you have had a guru.

08:49.261 --> 08:56.023
So we try to remove the guru from your mind
by so many ways.

08:56.283 --> 09:03.663
Deny them completely, absolutely, so that
they get out of your minds.

09:03.748 --> 09:11.529
And again raise the Kundalini, and from the
innermost, the Brahma Nadi as they call it,

09:11.591 --> 09:14.389
the innermost Nadi, the Sukshma Nadi.

09:14.459 --> 09:17.049
Otherwise, you cannot reach there.

09:17.099 --> 09:20.469
From outside you go on cleansing, cleansing,
cleansing until you reach there, you find

09:20.669 --> 09:22.709
you cannot pierce through.

09:22.769 --> 09:31.671
But outside cleaning helps you in one way,
that the Brahma Nadi becomes wider, the Nadi

09:31.723 --> 09:34.221
that is in the center of Sushumna.

09:34.331 --> 09:38.932
If you – there’s less pressure then it
is a wider one so for Kundalini rising there

09:39.001 --> 09:43.891
is a better chance.

09:43.891 --> 09:53.956
But in Sahaja Yoga, the subtlest of subtlest
Kundalini we catch, and thread it microscopically

09:54.071 --> 09:58.100
inside, and take it out.

09:58.141 --> 10:05.271
And by taking it out what happens, these chakras
definitely get enlightened, they expand.

10:05.331 --> 10:08.021
That’s how we expand the Sushumna.

10:08.109 --> 10:11.631
Expanding Brahmanadi.

10:11.791 --> 10:15.951
This was – this is the trick of Sahaja Yoga.

10:15.951 --> 10:19.890
Because this cleansing is going to take too
much time as you said.

10:19.930 --> 10:25.530
The whole thing is to be cleansed out and
then it is to be released and then you have

10:25.625 --> 10:30.675
to meet some guru who has to take it.

10:30.675 --> 10:38.125
So the Sadhachar [virtue, correct action],
whatever Buddha has said, the right, the right

10:38.125 --> 10:45.850
action, the right that he has said it, is
the one that is Dharma.

10:45.866 --> 10:48.280
That’s what is described.

10:48.660 --> 10:53.790
But that doesn’t work out with human beings,
it’s meant for people who are realized souls.

10:53.900 --> 11:01.111
Most of these religions are meant for realized
souls, you can find out.

11:01.111 --> 11:06.541
Actually realized souls only took to religion
before.

11:06.541 --> 11:14.001
Those who were born again, Dwijah, Brahmins,
who took to religion.

11:14.001 --> 11:22.731
But the time has come for people who are not
realized also to take to religion and to receive

11:22.849 --> 11:24.229
His blessings.

11:24.229 --> 11:34.148
Sahaja Yoga is the only way one can do it
– is to take it in the subtle-most – innermost

11:34.208 --> 11:43.968
Nadi, enlightened every chakra, increase the
size of the chakra, pierce a little bit here,

11:44.008 --> 11:50.139
then again raise the another thread, then
again the third thread, like that, go on expanding.

11:50.179 --> 11:52.969
[Aside: “This is it, you are alright.

11:53.074 --> 11:55.843
This is how it works out.

11:55.843 --> 12:01.523
In her case I did the same, I was just talking
to you.

12:01.593 --> 12:09.942
Now the main thing about Void one has to remember:
there is no rationality.

12:09.952 --> 12:19.146
It’s the hunger inside the stomach, and
hunger has no rationality: if it is hungry

12:19.210 --> 12:21.716
it will eat.

12:21.766 --> 12:28.951
It has to eat, no rationality can satisfy
it: if you are hungry you are a bhakta (seeker).

12:29.021 --> 12:37.691
And when you have spiritual hunger, the same
hunger becomes subtler and subtler, ultimately

12:37.731 --> 12:39.901
it becomes a spiritual hunger.

12:40.621 --> 12:47.181
First, the hunger starts of, say, food, of
primitive things.

12:47.181 --> 12:58.475
Then hunger for sex life, hunger for women,
hunger for men, then for power, then for money.

12:58.535 --> 13:02.835
Then the hunger for spirituality starts.

13:02.975 --> 13:14.055
When that hunger is concentrated and starts
rising without any rationality about it: you

13:14.055 --> 13:16.476
don’t know why you are seeking.

13:16.586 --> 13:25.156
Like Buddha: he had everything, he had a wife
and his father had provided him with everything.

13:25.156 --> 13:30.509
Still, his heart was seeking.

13:30.689 --> 13:33.069
Why was he seeking?

13:33.134 --> 13:39.524
It’s the hunger that is not rationality,
that isn’t explained.

13:39.524 --> 13:55.475
And then this hunger starts and the way we
quench that hunger is Dharma.

13:57.968 --> 14:02.929
The way we keep it intact is the Dharma.

14:02.929 --> 14:13.609
Supposing you are hungry: you go and eat some
poison: then it is a-dharma.

14:13.769 --> 14:18.819
I know you are hungry, but you have to eat
proper food.

14:20.882 --> 14:32.222
The knowledge about that is Dharma: what food
you must eat, what books you must read, what

14:32.518 --> 14:42.089
people you must meet, how you should live,
what should be your attitude towards others,

14:42.089 --> 14:51.139
others’ things, others’ wives, children,
daughters.

14:51.180 --> 15:00.050
Everything related to the other, all that
knowledge is Dharma.

15:00.170 --> 15:03.279
But it has no rationality.

15:05.119 --> 15:14.830
Like, you see, a man ran away, say, with somebody’s
daughter, he would say: «What’s wrong?»

15:14.835 --> 15:16.555
I cannot answer it.

15:16.560 --> 15:20.295
I cannot answer it.

15:20.330 --> 15:26.405
If a man has bad relations, say, with his
own mother.

15:26.991 --> 15:29.216
He says: «What’s wrong in this?».

15:29.185 --> 15:31.875
You cannot answer, there’s no rationality.

15:32.255 --> 15:38.286
It is so, it’s a fact: «Thou shall not
commit adultery.»

15:39.386 --> 15:42.513
Christ has said even to have adulterous eyes
is wrong.

15:42.943 --> 15:46.083
But at the time, it was Christ who came in.

15:46.213 --> 15:51.283
At the Moses’ time people did not know this
eyes business, but Christ could see that and

15:51.384 --> 15:57.033
He had said it, that: «Those who have even
adulterous eyes are committing a sin.»

16:02.863 --> 16:05.343
So, how to deal with the others?

16:07.230 --> 16:15.469
Say, materialism now: we are so attached to
matter, is also problem of the Nabhi.

16:15.569 --> 16:26.000
Materialism is a false identification with
matter, all falsehood – with matter, with

16:26.000 --> 16:36.582
human beings, with books, with all that is
created, is the problem of Nabhi, so you can

16:36.610 --> 16:41.610
understand how important is Nabhi.

16:42.592 --> 16:48.172
And the one that prescribes it, is the Dharma,
is the Guru.

16:48.252 --> 16:53.495
They did not come like Me to convince you
and argue out with you.

16:53.550 --> 16:55.800
They said: «Thou shalt not…».

16:55.800 --> 16:57.640
That’s a commandment.

16:57.640 --> 17:03.020
Commandment means there’s not to reason
why.

17:03.060 --> 17:05.820
It’s a commandment.

17:05.880 --> 17:08.400
There’s no rationality in Dharma.

17:08.550 --> 17:13.720
Now, the one who is dharmic does not think
about sin at all.

17:17.049 --> 17:19.519
Now, I’ll tell you about Myself.

17:19.579 --> 17:23.719
Say, I go to a party and they start a cabaret
dance.

17:23.799 --> 17:27.339
I do not think about it whether it is illegal
or whether it is wrong with this adharma,

17:27.389 --> 17:28.869
nothing.

17:28.919 --> 17:32.798
I do not think, but immediately I vomit.

17:32.909 --> 17:38.239
My grand-children, you see, they one day were
watching the TV and three of them came vomiting.

17:38.259 --> 17:41.809
I went and saw the TV and it was a horrid
thing going on.

17:41.869 --> 17:44.559
They just came and started vomiting.

17:44.629 --> 17:47.562
There’s no rationality about it: it is against
human sustenance.

17:47.642 --> 17:51.562
It is sub-human.

17:51.662 --> 17:56.212
Like animals cannot feel the dirt or filth,
we can.

17:54.687 --> 17:59.767
We feel horrible smell coming.

17:59.941 --> 18:08.140
But those who work, say, in filth cannot feel
any smell.

18:08.140 --> 18:16.935
If you go near a factory where sugar is produced
you feel terrible there, get the smell of

18:17.025 --> 18:21.805
these molasses and you can’t bear it, but
those who are working there are so much used

18:21.875 --> 18:24.595
to it that they cannot feel it.

18:24.735 --> 18:27.813
Those who live in sin cannot feel the sin
after some time, they become insensitive to

18:27.855 --> 18:28.855
it.

18:30.413 --> 18:31.793
But sin is a sin.

18:33.787 --> 18:37.057
So the insensitivity when we develop within
ourselves we become adharmic.

18:37.137 --> 18:40.477
When we are sensitive about it, we are dharmic.

18:40.607 --> 18:50.677
On the left-hand side, the intuition about
it, the auspiciousness of it – is the thing

18:50.677 --> 18:53.587
that one has to learn, the auspiciousness.

18:53.657 --> 18:58.797
A housewife is to be respected, honoured and
comforted because it is auspicious.

18:58.797 --> 19:01.756
A wife has to be respectable.

19:01.756 --> 19:08.912
A housewife doesn’t – It doesn’t look
nice for a housewife, you see, to be dressed

19:08.972 --> 19:11.621
in a funny way.

19:11.661 --> 19:17.401
Once a chief cabinet secretary from India,
his wife had come and she used to think she

19:17.412 --> 19:20.050
is very young and smart or something.

19:20.062 --> 19:24.102
She was wearing those tight jeans and things
like that, you see.

19:24.032 --> 19:27.142
And the poor husband, you see, looked at this
side, that side.

19:27.202 --> 19:29.282
He didn’t know what to do.

19:29.392 --> 19:31.842
And she is – I mean, very big man.

19:31.902 --> 19:33.122
Alright.

19:33.232 --> 19:38.257
And she came down in London, she was thinking:
«Oh, she is a great, smart thing», you know.

19:38.417 --> 19:42.647
And they were invited to a dinner – it’s
a real thing, you know, real thing that has

19:42.711 --> 19:43.711
happened.

19:43.711 --> 19:47.181
And when this man was to go from somewhere
and she had to go from somewhere else.

19:47.351 --> 19:49.651
So, when he went there, he said: «Where is
my wife?»

19:49.661 --> 19:52.371
Said: «She hasn’t come right now.»

19:52.391 --> 19:55.251
He said: «No, she was to come, she is not
like that, she is much smarter than me, she

19:55.241 --> 19:56.611
must have arrived.»

19:56.654 --> 19:59.364
He looked around, he couldn’t find her.

19:59.404 --> 20:05.201
And there was a lady standing, he said: «There’s
your secretary has come, she is standing there.»

20:05.264 --> 20:10.665
And he didn’t know what to say because she
really looked like a secretary and not his

20:10.733 --> 20:11.733
wife.

20:14.345 --> 20:21.135
So the housewife has to be dignified and respectable
and she is to be respected.

20:22.965 --> 20:25.437
It’s the part of that auspiciousness.

20:27.277 --> 20:35.677
And the wife, that essence of a wife is the
governing…

20:35.677 --> 20:44.308
So you can imagine those women who used to
stand for lib and all that and those who tried

20:44.358 --> 20:48.648
to sort of say that: «Why should we be respectable
if the husband is not if he is carrying on

20:49.226 --> 20:54.136
with the other women I should also carry on
with the other men.»

20:54.266 --> 21:01.646
You must know that you are withholding that
great position in the stomach, on the left-hand

21:01.710 --> 21:04.041
side of every human being.

21:04.191 --> 21:08.081
And that’s why the left Nabhi catches in
England so much; and in America, I think it’s

21:08.181 --> 21:11.181
missing already (laughter).

21:18.081 --> 21:25.843
So, that is to ask to, say, to a man you see,
who is so developed, and is so, he thinks

21:25.931 --> 21:32.035
no ends of himself, you see, and the civilization
where work is so important and money is even

21:32.095 --> 21:35.445
more important than work is.

21:35.555 --> 21:41.155
To him, it’s silly to think that a housewife’s
respectability is so important in the play

21:41.195 --> 21:42.855
of the universe.

21:42.855 --> 21:44.515
Yes, it is.

21:44.515 --> 21:49.570
Where the women become dis-respectable the
whole – you see, that’s the breaking point

21:49.585 --> 21:50.860
of the society.

21:51.020 --> 21:54.110
There the human beings will start destroying.

21:54.165 --> 21:57.425
That’s the real atomic bomb you have got.

22:00.956 --> 22:03.466
But it is so, I cannot rationalize it, it
is made like that.

22:11.056 --> 22:13.896
All the Gurus have said: «You should not
drink.»

22:13.926 --> 22:15.346
Even Moses.

22:17.218 --> 22:27.408
Every one of them has said: «You cannot drink»,
means take any kind of ann alcohol or any

22:27.408 --> 22:30.825
things that will take away your awareness,
because that is the place of your awareness.

22:31.010 --> 22:38.685
In the sense that whatever goes wrong here
spoils your attention, and if your attention

22:38.755 --> 22:41.885
is spoiled, your awareness is spoiled.

22:41.947 --> 22:45.936
The attention is in here.

22:46.026 --> 22:49.116
The attention is in the stomach, in the Void.

22:49.267 --> 22:52.067
So, how important is your attention.

22:52.067 --> 22:55.897
Wherever you put your attention, that works
out.

22:55.897 --> 23:00.377
When you are realized, then your attention
is realized.

23:00.377 --> 23:10.983
Wherever you put your attention it works like
a spade, it works like a sword, it works like

23:11.028 --> 23:21.968
a loving hand, it works like a kiss, it works
like a comforting heart.

23:21.968 --> 23:25.403
It is an enlightened attention in your stomach.

23:25.533 --> 23:32.013
You see, the mother has the child in the stomach,
in the womb, and how it looks after the child,

23:32.076 --> 23:35.326
a little baby, how it protects.

23:35.326 --> 23:50.736
All that is there is given to us through our
Gurus, our own beings which are our masters,

23:50.986 --> 23:52.846
who teach us.

23:53.172 --> 23:56.522
The stomach teaches you, your stomach is your
Guru.

23:56.522 --> 24:06.242
Amoeba became a human being through the stomach
only, through the hunger it had.

24:06.222 --> 24:09.987
If it did not have hunger it would not have
evolved.

24:10.032 --> 24:12.702
And the hunger teaches you.

24:12.812 --> 24:18.902
And when you learn it properly, then you become
the Guru yourself of the whole world and the

24:18.952 --> 24:19.952
universe.

24:27.977 --> 24:34.517
Void, that’s why is very important, and
when you have had bad gurus, you have read

24:34.517 --> 24:42.737
horrible books, accepted them as facts and
truths, then your Void gets spoiled, your

24:42.737 --> 24:45.259
attention gets spoiled.

24:47.419 --> 24:51.759
It goes to wrong things.

24:51.759 --> 25:01.249
Attention, when it works through your eyes,
can also go to wrong things.

25:01.249 --> 25:07.771
Everywhere wherever the attention moves it
can do wrong things if it is adharmic.

25:07.941 --> 25:12.171
But as I said there is no rationality about
it.

25:12.201 --> 25:14.091
Dharma is to be accepted.

25:15.922 --> 25:17.671
You cannot rationalize it.

25:18.801 --> 25:27.541
To a point, you may try, but how far it harms
you, you cannot rationalize.

25:30.101 --> 25:33.637
And then the curses of Divine comes on you.

25:39.117 --> 25:48.992
Any kind of fanaticism or identification with
one ideal – like Muslims thinking they are

25:49.017 --> 25:50.017
Muslims.

25:51.548 --> 25:53.472
They are adharmic.

25:53.528 --> 25:56.128
They are not dharmic.

25:56.128 --> 26:03.098
Dharma is that you have to respect all the
religions.

26:03.098 --> 26:08.538
It is a sin not to respect any incarnation.

26:08.538 --> 26:18.384
It is a sin not to respect any religion.

26:18.504 --> 26:26.674
And to identify with one and denounce the
other.

26:26.674 --> 26:34.294
So, give up all these false dharmas and come
to that one Dharma which evolves you, which

26:34.294 --> 26:45.494
gives you light by which you can see the oneness
among all these religions.

26:45.494 --> 26:53.105
As I’ve said it before, that they are like
beautiful flowers on one tree nurtured by

26:53.165 --> 27:01.874
one sap, adorned by one tree; but fools take
the flowers out, say that “These are our

27:01.874 --> 27:05.324
flowers” and kill them.

27:05.324 --> 27:11.540
And when these flowers die, ugliness becomes
the so-called religions.

27:15.902 --> 27:22.862
So, in essences, respect all the religions,
and all the incarnations.

27:19.102 --> 27:32.472
Fanaticism is absolutely against the Nabhi
and against the Void because the whole balance

27:32.524 --> 27:34.754
of your Void is to be kept.

27:34.754 --> 27:40.739
In a very subtle and subtler form, you will
be sticking onto it.

27:40.799 --> 27:45.579
Say, you are born a Christian, so whatever
you may try you cannot get out of this feeling

27:45.624 --> 27:47.859
that “We are Christians”.

27:46.650 --> 27:53.646
You’ll have much more respect for Mary in
heart than for, say, Lakshmi.

27:53.926 --> 28:03.996
While you are a Hindu, you will have much
more respect for Radha than for Mary.

28:04.116 --> 28:09.396
That will be lingering on and lingering on.

28:09.396 --> 28:17.676
When you develop that balance alright, then
you are dharmic.

28:17.676 --> 28:24.976
That balancing has to be done.

28:24.976 --> 28:31.026
So one realization is within you like this.

28:31.026 --> 28:40.496
And one realization is this way, among you,
and this is Dharma.

28:40.496 --> 28:49.257
Among all of you, there has to be another
integration, a complete integration of understanding.

28:49.387 --> 28:58.457
Whether you are white, black or red, whether
a Hindu, Christian or anything, you must know

28:58.532 --> 29:06.012
that there is only one way that is the living
way of evolution and that there is only one

29:06.062 --> 29:07.062
God.

29:07.062 --> 29:16.782
And all of them are aspects of the same God,
and there is no quarreling among them.

29:16.782 --> 29:18.472
Why are you quarreling?

29:18.472 --> 29:23.232
This goes against the Void.

29:23.232 --> 29:28.582
Complete integration works out in the stomach.

29:28.582 --> 29:38.672
And when you are completely integrated, you’ll
be surprised, rationality drops out.

29:38.822 --> 29:42.362
Automatically it drops out.

29:42.362 --> 29:47.073
Rationality keeps disintegration because if
your heart says something, rationality says:

29:47.133 --> 29:50.143
«No, it’s not right.».

29:50.143 --> 30:01.643
But, if you take out your rationality there
and just see for yourself, then wisdom comes

30:01.643 --> 30:08.213
in and you just do it whatever is wise and
good for your spirituality.

30:19.022 --> 30:21.782
[Aside: “How are you now?

30:21.782 --> 30:25.162
It’s better, it’s working out”.]

30:25.162 --> 30:29.365
So, Void we use in Sahaja Yoga in many ways.

30:29.667 --> 30:36.547
First of all, we have to, first of all, see
the Void of a person, how he has got the Void.

30:36.657 --> 30:40.317
You can see it very easily because it might
be pulsating.

30:40.487 --> 30:44.985
Maybe not be in your presence, I don’t know,
but in My presence it does.

30:45.035 --> 30:47.705
But immediately you can feel the Void.

30:47.766 --> 30:51.105
The Void you feel on here, or on here.

30:51.275 --> 30:55.925
Now, just see these are the bases of all the
chakras.

30:56.020 --> 30:59.725
You feel the Void here, or here.

30:59.825 --> 31:05.809
Basis of all the chakras you can feel, so
you can understand how important is Void.

31:05.899 --> 31:11.849
Now, if it is catching here anywhere, or catching
over here, you see, then you have to ask the

31:11.919 --> 31:23.989
questions about these various points: whether
he is a materialist, whether he is a fanatic.

31:24.071 --> 31:27.607
But these questions you cannot ask that directly,
because if I say: «Are you a fanatic?»,

31:27.667 --> 31:30.117
he’ll hit Me hard.

31:30.117 --> 31:31.117
[Laughter]

31:33.477 --> 31:37.587
You have to be very, very clever about it.

31:37.937 --> 31:42.880
Now, how to ask a person whether you are a
fanatic or not?

31:42.980 --> 31:45.410
Very easy.

31:45.510 --> 31:47.640
Say, he
is a Muslim.

31:47.695 --> 31:55.185
So, you just ask him to put your hand, saying
that: «Should I put some Kumkum on your head?»

31:55.405 --> 32:02.736
So his fanaticism will come out immediately:
«I can’t do this!»

32:02.856 --> 32:10.536
If he is a Christian then you just ask him:
«Can you put a Swastika on your hand?»

32:11.926 --> 32:13.806
Cross he’ll accept.

32:13.806 --> 32:17.786
Swastika: «No, I’m not Hitler!»

32:17.786 --> 32:18.767
(Laughter)

32:18.817 --> 32:24.577
That’s how you can make it out whether he
is open-minded or not, by suggesting things

32:24.552 --> 32:25.447
like this.

32:25.922 --> 32:27.902
So then he comes out with his fanaticism.

32:27.952 --> 32:29.652
Then what do you do?

32:29.697 --> 32:32.392
You do not condemn him as fanatic, no.

32:32.422 --> 32:34.412
That won’t be Sahaja style.

32:34.552 --> 32:36.932
You say: «Alright, alright I’ve got it.

32:37.006 --> 32:39.732
The cross, will that be alright?

32:39.822 --> 32:41.582
Alright, take the cross.

32:41.682 --> 32:45.352
Now, if I say that cross was first Swastika
then it became cross, will you be angry?»

32:45.452 --> 32:49.879
Gradually it will work out.

32:49.989 --> 32:56.250
But if he is a fanatic you go outside and
tell Mohammad Sahib to beat him nicely.

32:56.339 --> 32:58.479
So He’ll do the job.

32:58.559 --> 33:02.529
Shoebeating is very necessary for all the
fanatics.

33:02.599 --> 33:05.419
Nice shoebeating.

33:05.489 --> 33:11.179
But fanatics are one of the most difficult.

33:11.289 --> 33:14.619
Then those who have been to other gurus also
will be showing up.

33:14.693 --> 33:18.639
These days you don’t get fanatics so many
who’d come to Sahaja Yoga.

33:18.749 --> 33:24.269
Mostly they are guru-bitten (Shri Mataji laughs).

33:24.229 --> 33:28.633
You see, there are frostbitten people, there
are guru-bitten also (She laughs).

33:28.817 --> 33:32.093
I mean, you see, mostly they are guru-bitten.

33:32.143 --> 33:33.783
Then you ask them: «Have you been to a guru?

33:33.788 --> 33:35.503
What your guru has done?

33:35.547 --> 33:36.593
This, that.»

33:36.713 --> 33:40.073
If you tell them sometimes they can be fanatically
attached to their gurus.

33:40.053 --> 33:41.583
Then they might be angry.

33:41.603 --> 33:43.413
They do it, but what to do?

33:43.387 --> 33:45.063
You see sometimes you have to tell them.

33:45.077 --> 33:46.077
[A ring bells – apart:

33:46.147 --> 33:47.297
Shri Mataji: It’s the food?

33:47.327 --> 33:48.757
Yogi: Yes.

33:48.757 --> 33:50.507
Yogi: Yes, Shri Mataji.

33:50.558 --> 33:55.007
Shri Mataji: It’s good they are looking
after the food very nicely.

33:55.072 --> 33:58.762
(Laughter) Otherwise, if you have to cook
also, then all your attention is there.

33:58.822 --> 34:01.612
So, much better than your ashram.

34:01.642 --> 34:03.422
(Laughter)

34:03.512 --> 34:04.452
Yogi: Agreed!

34:04.552 --> 34:07.832
Shri Mataji: No headache, nothing, you are
having a nice time here and their food is

34:07.927 --> 34:11.107
ready, now serve, come along, have your food.

34:11.147 --> 34:13.297
Much better than your ashram.

34:13.353 --> 34:16.533
So, the right time, we are talking about Void.

34:16.638 --> 34:19.828
(Laughter) Alright.

34:19.828 --> 34:24.618
I’ll sit here –

34:28.618 --> 34:33.578
(Yogi speaks: “All our hunger has been satisfied
today."

34:33.638 --> 34:35.248
Shri Mataji laughs)

34:35.204 --> 34:38.504
Shri Mataji: Yes, make the food also dharmic
and then eat it.

34:38.574 --> 34:39.104
Good.

34:39.165 --> 34:40.555
How are you now?

34:40.609 --> 34:41.609
Better?

34:41.609 --> 34:42.819
Yogini: Yes!

34:42.819 --> 34:43.949
Shri Mataji: Yes!

34:44.039 --> 34:47.885
This will do good to many because so many
have had this problem with guru business.

34:48.055 --> 34:49.389
How are you now?

34:49.445 --> 34:50.349
It’s good…]

34:50.375 --> 34:51.729
[Tape interruption]

34:51.789 --> 34:55.699
It’s such a wide subject that I cannot cover
it in one lecture, you’ll require many more;

34:55.789 --> 35:04.069
but the most important thing about Void is
that that once you are enlightened, you become

35:04.139 --> 35:05.879
dharmic yourself.

35:05.909 --> 35:10.659
The Dharma starts flowing through your hand.

35:10.734 --> 35:17.314
These vibrations have a capacity to establish
Dharma.

35:17.314 --> 35:22.821
So, when you put your hands now towards the
five elements, say you put your hands towards

35:22.831 --> 35:29.521
the water, or you put your hand in the water
– the water gets enlighted, vibrated.

35:29.751 --> 35:36.511
Then if somebody takes that water, it will
establish Dharma into that person.

35:36.607 --> 35:41.947
Supposing somebody is a drunkard, now you
put this vibrated water to him, give him to

35:42.011 --> 35:43.011
drink.

35:43.011 --> 35:45.977
He’ll feel nauseated after drinks.

35:46.021 --> 35:49.657
He’ll throw away the drinks, then he will
stop.

35:49.737 --> 35:54.527
Some of you have noticed that when you came
to Me first you felt a terrible nausea within

35:54.611 --> 35:59.797
you and you felt like vomiting, sometimes
you felt uneasy, you see.

35:59.837 --> 36:07.287
So these vibrations through the water now
pass into your stomach and they establish

36:07.352 --> 36:10.612
Dharma there, the proper relationship.

36:10.677 --> 36:17.992
It so happens that if you go on taking this
water, the right-side is that physically you

36:18.032 --> 36:24.152
feel alright, and the water can give you such
a power that you will never get cancer of

36:24.172 --> 36:29.062
the stomach, never get any trouble with the
stomach.

36:29.097 --> 36:36.707
But left-side side it has greater power, this
water, that it cleanses you – your sins

36:36.707 --> 36:42.857
– and puts your attention, fixes it up on
Dharma.

36:42.857 --> 36:48.073
So, your attention doesn’t do – you are
not tempted, that’s how you have seen people

36:48.108 --> 36:52.218
who come to Sahaja Yoga can give up drinks
easily.

36:52.218 --> 36:56.013
Because it turns your attention towards Dharma.

36:56.573 --> 37:00.513
Then if you want to take drinks you just don’t
feel like after some time.

37:00.579 --> 37:04.509
You feel like vomiting, you feel like headache,
and all that.

37:04.554 --> 37:06.419
And it happens so easily.

37:06.452 --> 37:10.179
Now we know somebody’s reaction – he gave
up with all his drinking in no time.

37:10.399 --> 37:15.159
Otherwise, it’s not possible to do it, but
because of this happening in the stomach,

37:15.199 --> 37:16.989
now you cannot drink.

37:19.643 --> 37:20.643
Just imagine.

37:20.643 --> 37:30.212
This is the great thing about Void is that
once you are enlightened you can give something

37:30.277 --> 37:32.672
to the nature.

37:32.722 --> 37:36.832
You have been drawing everything from nature
so far.

37:36.872 --> 37:39.662
First time now you start giving something
to the nature.

37:39.732 --> 37:43.561
And what you give to the nature is so nourishing
to it also.

37:43.561 --> 37:51.502
Supposing you give vibrations to, say, fruits,
or to trees, or to flowers.

37:51.602 --> 37:55.892
You will find they will be ten times more,
the growth will be much more, they will be

37:55.946 --> 37:56.946
lustrous.

37:56.946 --> 38:02.152
And they will be very juicy, very tasty and
the whole atmosphere will be different.

38:02.352 --> 38:08.402
Maybe after some time these trees, if they
will be standing there, anybody will be passing

38:08.472 --> 38:13.282
that way, if he touches the tree they will
get the vibrations also from there.

38:13.272 --> 38:17.002
So maybe a tree may become a curer, something
like that.

38:17.052 --> 38:22.472
All those waters and all that, we talk of
«curing water», are nothing but vibrated

38:22.562 --> 38:23.732
waters.

38:23.862 --> 38:25.172
They are vibrated.

38:25.243 --> 38:29.790
So, if the vibrated water goes inside, you
get cured.

38:29.840 --> 38:35.410
So, this is on the left-hand side it works,
that it establishes your religion within you.

38:37.517 --> 38:44.400
All the problems you have had is all completely
cleansed out by that.

38:44.690 --> 38:48.070
In the same way, if you enlighten a light
– now here [Mother turns to the flame of

38:48.115 --> 38:51.420
the candle] you have seen so many times just
here, what you can enlighten a light is.

38:51.515 --> 38:55.570
So it starts going, see, both are there but
this one is working as if…

38:55.630 --> 39:02.040
It’s actually also going vertically, but
this and this you have taking out the black.

39:02.110 --> 39:03.760
It is because it is enlightened.

39:03.790 --> 39:05.450
That is also enlightened, no?

39:05.450 --> 39:07.050
So it may also take out.

39:07.134 --> 39:09.494
But this one actually in the hand is taking
away the…

39:10.510 --> 39:15.520
If you see these lights you can feel they
are like pulled out like this.

39:15.825 --> 39:19.500
As if, you see, the realized lights are pulled
out like this, straight.

39:19.781 --> 39:28.591
And, I’ve been to some of these churches
where they have these lights, and as soon

39:28.571 --> 39:31.431
as I enter inside they all go “kakakakakak”.

39:31.451 --> 39:32.231
(Shri Mataji laughs)

39:32.296 --> 39:36.161
It is interesting to see how they start suddenly
glowing like that.

39:36.221 --> 39:40.971
But people do not notice it because they do
not understand how, why it has happened, but

39:40.961 --> 39:42.851
you can understand that.

39:43.046 --> 39:45.857
So, if you put the light, enlightened light
–

39:45.928 --> 39:50.207
Say, yesterday – the other day we had that
Havana, is the enlightened light.

39:50.411 --> 39:54.047
Havana we had made it enlightened, Jagrut.

39:55.017 --> 40:00.977
Then whatever we put into it, you see, our
badhas and everything, it burned whatever

40:01.017 --> 40:02.867
we wanted to burn away.

40:02.943 --> 40:11.512
What is the beauty of fire is that, say, if
you have some mixed-up gold and you put it

40:11.542 --> 40:17.602
to fire, you will find the gold will be separated
and the filth or dirt or whatever is inside

40:17.637 --> 40:18.992
it will be separated.

40:19.162 --> 40:24.582
So, this quality, which is the right-hand
side quality of the fire is, becomes in the

40:24.597 --> 40:31.947
left-hand side is that when you go near such
a fire, or you use such a fire or a light,

40:32.144 --> 40:41.524
then what happens that whatever is unwanted
in you is burned away, and you get the pure

40:41.572 --> 40:42.382
thing.

40:42.439 --> 40:43.439
So it purifies.

40:45.166 --> 40:50.700
Fire is a purifier and it is a melter, it
melts your heart.

40:50.786 --> 40:54.610
This fire melts your heart and you feel the
compassion.

40:54.700 --> 41:01.680
So that’s how every element can be enlightened,
and this is the work done in the Void by your

41:01.700 --> 41:02.700
Kundalini.

41:02.925 --> 41:10.035
Kundalini goes to various places and She enlightens
all these elements in your stomach.

41:10.230 --> 41:15.115
In the stomach, the basic principle is of
water.

41:15.275 --> 41:22.555
The Void is covered with water, and in the
water there is salt, and the salt is nothing

41:22.579 --> 41:24.059
but is the Dharma.

41:24.964 --> 41:26.709
Is the Dharma, the salt.

41:27.741 --> 41:34.509
That’s why when we give you salt what happens
– the salt that is vibrated goes and helps

41:34.539 --> 41:36.249
you in the stomach.

41:36.264 --> 41:47.044
And salt shows its own nature there by absorbing
all that is in you which is, we can say, is

41:47.070 --> 41:48.164
mobile there.

41:48.200 --> 41:55.114
A person supposing is, has got a cancer problem,
then he should take salt.

41:55.245 --> 41:59.325
If he has a right-hand side problem, he should,
she should just take sugar.

41:59.402 --> 42:05.905
So these are the two qualities, you see, the
five of dharmas are done by salt and five

42:06.045 --> 42:07.285
by sugar.

42:07.385 --> 42:11.235
And these are the best solvents in the water,
as you know.

42:11.318 --> 42:19.448
So, all these three things put together: water,
then salt, then the sugar, they solve the

42:19.480 --> 42:21.000
problem of the Void.

42:21.000 --> 42:24.020
That’s why we use these two things.

42:24.020 --> 42:27.440
If you remember Christ has said that “you
are the salt”.

42:27.440 --> 42:33.361
That means you are the Gurus.

42:33.430 --> 42:35.301
Salt is the Guru.

42:35.850 --> 42:38.711
That’s why he said: «You are the salt.»

42:38.780 --> 42:40.711
Because you are the Gurus.

42:40.761 --> 42:43.151
And salt dissolves into water.

42:43.411 --> 42:46.011
Water is the Dharma.

42:46.223 --> 42:50.141
They are the absorbers – (a noise covers
some words… probably “salt”) always

42:50.163 --> 42:52.121
has a water of crystallization.

42:52.341 --> 42:57.251
They, it cannot exist without, the salt cannot
exist without water.

42:57.315 --> 43:00.931
So, the water and salt put together means
ocean.

43:01.045 --> 43:03.265
So Void is the ocean within us.

43:03.389 --> 43:06.248
That’s why it is called as Sagara.

43:06.248 --> 43:10.160
That means all the oceans of the world are
in our stomach.

43:10.559 --> 43:15.150
And if you want to hear them sometimes, you
can put your thumb in my ears and you can

43:15.180 --> 43:18.860
hear it coming (as a sound?

43:19.120 --> 43:20.939
Indistinct), you can hear it.

43:21.159 --> 43:30.279
So this is all the time this ocean is churned
and out of it comes out all that is good,

43:30.419 --> 43:38.843
and whatever is bad is burnt away, or washed
away, or made to – with the air – it is

43:38.349 --> 43:53.666
So the air element is also there, air element
that we see all around.

43:38.820 --> 43:43.863
made to be swept off.

43:53.701 --> 44:01.286
[Recording cut] … so the vibrated air is
a very important thing and it helps a lot.

44:01.552 --> 44:02.552
[Recording cut]

44:02.856 --> 44:09.386
So I’ve talked to you about all the four,
but the fifth one is Akasha, it’s the ether,

44:09.571 --> 44:10.571
you can say.

44:16.660 --> 44:21.521
That works out when you are a realized soul.

44:21.607 --> 44:25.101
Then you, you also vibrate the Ether.

44:26.291 --> 44:31.975
That’s how our main collective work is done,
through the Ether, you see.

44:32.351 --> 44:39.484
Now, supposing I want that you should get
a proper seat – “Whether you are going

44:39.589 --> 44:44.373
or something, alright, take a seat, alright”
– anything materialistic you can say, or

44:44.538 --> 44:47.763
My chair how do you down there, how will this…

44:47.946 --> 44:51.913
I have to just worry about it, immediately
[Shri Mataji snaps Her fingers] the orders

44:52.243 --> 44:53.692
are sent, alright?

44:53.745 --> 45:00.372
So, Saint Michael and Saint Gabriel, both
of them say: «Now what should we do?

45:00.441 --> 45:02.542
We must find a proper place.»

45:02.642 --> 45:05.482
So, they take Don into consideration,

45:05.512 --> 45:09.382
then they bring him down here and find out a nice
place for him.

45:09.390 --> 45:11.152
Is all done through Ether.

45:11.170 --> 45:18.480
Ether, it becomes – when it is enlightened,
you see, then it communicates the ideas, the

45:18.493 --> 45:23.020
things which are Divine or the desires, the
Divine desires are carried out.

45:23.063 --> 45:27.500
And then you are placed into his hands, sometimes
you are surprised: «How am I here?

45:27.543 --> 45:28.830
How are you here?

45:28.843 --> 45:30.330
How do I meet you?

45:30.383 --> 45:33.550
I mean, I was not to come this side and then
now how did I come?»

45:33.565 --> 45:36.748
All these things can be done through the Ether
which…

45:36.870 --> 45:40.978
Even we get our television and everything
through Ether.

45:41.090 --> 45:52.098
But on the television, if the Ether, if you,
if you, say, enlighten it, then it will so

45:52.140 --> 45:55.940
happen, that a bad [spread?] program won’t
materialize.

45:56.245 --> 45:59.500
It won’t materialize.

45:59.885 --> 46:02.345
It can work very dynamically.

46:02.535 --> 46:05.785
You cannot imagine how these miracles take
place.

46:05.865 --> 46:11.505
And real miracles are felt, you know of course
we do feel the miracles of all the other elements,

46:11.565 --> 46:15.815
but it’s not so obvious as that of the Ether
because you are suddenly surprised: «How

46:15.975 --> 46:16.975
this?

46:16.975 --> 46:17.975
Why?»

46:18.207 --> 46:23.165
And it’s – everybody is surprised at it,
all here in in the plate you get all this.

46:23.217 --> 46:28.229
So, this is done by Ether and it is so miraculous.

46:28.369 --> 46:34.265
It is so miraculous, that it is hard to believe
that it is possible.

46:34.289 --> 46:39.419
Now, this Ether works day-time and night-time.

46:39.507 --> 46:42.909
It doesn’t take rest anywhere.

46:42.987 --> 46:47.389
It’s all the time up for us, means it is
all the time ready to work out the divine

46:47.461 --> 46:48.461
work.

46:48.501 --> 46:51.619
All the time it is ready to work out the divine
work.

46:51.631 --> 46:52.871
It doesn’t wait.

46:52.921 --> 46:59.071
It doesn’t wait for anyone to give orders
or anything; it’s just, just waiting there.

46:59.152 --> 47:05.761
As soon as it sees that this is desired, alright,
nothing is to be told, just to desire and

47:05.791 --> 47:08.971
you say that: «Oh, what will be happening
to such and such person?»

47:09.041 --> 47:10.551
Finished, it’s done.

47:10.591 --> 47:13.001
It has been transmitted.

47:13.201 --> 47:20.631
The same Ether that transmits the – what
you call?

47:20.750 --> 47:26.581
– the air transmissions which you receive
on the radios, radio transmissions.

47:26.779 --> 47:30.189
The same one, when enlightened, does all this
job.

47:32.064 --> 47:33.999
He works it out, everything.

47:34.504 --> 47:37.579
Everything that you want it works it out.

47:37.704 --> 47:40.919
And there’s how the angels show their…

47:41.124 --> 47:46.859
[Shri Mataji searches the word in Marathi]
their miraculous feats.

47:48.514 --> 47:55.464
But it is worth noticing all that and watching
it, and witnessing it and noting it down:

47:55.578 --> 47:58.584
«Oh, how it helped and how it worked out!»

47:58.658 --> 48:05.124
And it also Ether when enlightened brings
people closer to Divine power.

48:05.198 --> 48:07.214
It arranges and organizes.

48:09.079 --> 48:17.579
But now, one would ask what is the necessity
for God to have such complicated methods of

48:17.599 --> 48:21.219
“enlightening the matter”?

48:21.759 --> 48:26.309
Why not it has already the enlightened matter?

48:26.339 --> 48:32.599
It’s the question one should ask, I mean,
I’m asking as you people are there, so I’m

48:32.649 --> 48:33.649
asking you.

48:33.812 --> 48:35.419
Let’s see the answer.

48:35.572 --> 48:37.112
That’s your problem.

48:37.232 --> 48:42.302
Yesterday I told you to say that “I’m
not guilty”.

48:42.410 --> 48:51.422
It’s just a joke you are enjoying, you are
just playing games with yourself when you

48:51.430 --> 48:52.430
say that.

48:52.470 --> 48:57.950
Because you like to play such terrible jokes
with yourself.

48:58.064 --> 49:00.280
Don’t say that you are guilty.

49:00.360 --> 49:01.360
At all.

49:01.441 --> 49:08.321
By saying that, you see, you are trying to
enjoy a sort of a sadism against yourself.

49:08.316 --> 49:10.891
You are against yourself.

49:11.046 --> 49:14.351
Self that is your Spirit.

49:17.786 --> 49:21.586
The yogi: That’s what it feels like, it
feels like…

49:21.606 --> 49:22.606
(Indistinct words)

49:22.886 --> 49:25.306
Shri Mataji: That’s not a good thing.

49:25.346 --> 49:32.196
That’s not what is wanted, is not what is
desired, so just don’t play on them.

49:32.796 --> 49:36.046
Whatever are your moods are not correct.

49:36.176 --> 49:38.246
They should not be there.

49:42.265 --> 49:45.356
By your moods, you are lost.

49:46.585 --> 49:52.966
Sometimes you get this mood, sometimes you
get another mood of aggression.

49:53.885 --> 49:56.885
Whether is a temper or something like that.

49:57.027 --> 49:59.895
And sometimes you get into this kind of an
apologetic mood.

49:59.947 --> 50:01.867
Both are useless, absolutely useless.

50:01.867 --> 50:04.425
Just throw them away.

50:05.029 --> 50:06.767
Why should we do it?

50:22.444 --> 50:24.737
Both are mythical.

50:31.864 --> 50:35.224
– (The yogi speaks) – Yes, this positivity
also – this so-called positivity means aggression

50:35.240 --> 50:39.414
on others, you start showing your aggression
on others.

50:39.654 --> 50:41.914
You can aggress others also.

50:43.169 --> 50:45.029
That’s even worse.

50:49.144 --> 50:53.004
– (The yogi speaks) – That’s, that’s,
that’s, that’s the thing I was saying.

50:53.454 --> 50:56.874
Be joyous, be happy for what God has given
you.

50:59.054 --> 51:01.550
Watch the birds in the morning time.

51:04.423 --> 51:06.780
See the flowers in the morning time.

51:11.455 --> 51:14.222
What do they have?

51:14.495 --> 51:23.102
They are standing in the sun, in the rain,
they are facing the nature all the time.

51:23.130 --> 51:27.760
Imagine the delicate petals of the flowers.

51:31.627 --> 51:37.097
Do they show any signs of negativity or of
aggression?

51:40.487 --> 51:42.507
They only emit fragrance.

51:43.657 --> 51:46.427
Till they live they will emit fragrance.

51:46.497 --> 51:49.857
When they will die, they are not bothered.

51:54.770 --> 51:59.030
Aggressive person cannot come to Sahaja Yoga,
he cannot go very far.

51:59.770 --> 52:03.170
Neither a negative person, but aggressive
cannot.

52:03.495 --> 52:04.740
He’ll drop out.

52:09.502 --> 52:12.630
Sahaja Yoga recedes from such people.

52:18.812 --> 52:25.422
You have to be humble, but you are not to
be slaves.

52:28.675 --> 52:34.765
In extremes at least one should know the difference
between the two.

52:35.912 --> 52:40.722
You see, there is extremes, say something
is very black – then you can see the white

52:40.757 --> 52:43.762
very clearly against it, isn’t it?

52:43.927 --> 52:49.017
And when you know how to move from one extreme
to another extremes, you should be able to

52:49.030 --> 52:54.607
see both the things very clearly.

52:56.937 --> 53:00.015
And that’s how you come to the center.

53:05.965 --> 53:09.635
I mean, it is for your own good to be like
that.

53:11.565 --> 53:15.335
You may say: “Yes, we understand, Mother,
but we can’t do it”.

53:16.715 --> 53:18.265
Could try.

53:18.712 --> 53:28.840
You just watch yourself and see how it works,
how your mind is working: it’s your horse

53:28.870 --> 53:31.320
and you have to master it.

53:32.560 --> 53:38.110
You are supposed to be a rider and the horse
is taking you somewhere wherever it feels

53:38.121 --> 53:45.785
like, either to negativity or to the positivity
so-called – means the aggressiveness.

53:45.899 --> 53:55.159
It’s the horse that is leading you, not
you are leading the horse.

53:55.179 --> 53:58.279
What kind of a rider it is?

54:01.119 --> 54:09.809
And the horse is like a pendulum and you are
led by it.

54:12.649 --> 54:19.330
And when you identify yourself with that horse
you think: “What to do?

54:19.359 --> 54:20.779
It is happening."

54:20.836 --> 54:22.869
You can control it.

54:32.312 --> 54:39.605
You have to tell yourself, that is to tell
your mind to behave itself.

54:41.540 --> 54:48.140
Otherwise, you people cannot go very deep
into Sahaja Yoga.

54:48.519 --> 54:50.730
You have to go much deeper.

54:51.215 --> 54:56.235
If you are worried about superficialities
you cannot go deeper.

55:01.465 --> 55:03.995
Deep down is the Truth.

55:04.055 --> 55:05.675
There lies all the joy.

55:10.996 --> 55:16.846
All the trees, all the big trees have their
roots deep down.

55:19.284 --> 55:23.596
Find out your roots: where are they?

55:24.384 --> 55:39.044
They are all embedded in your heart and in
your Spirit, not in these superficial things

55:39.074 --> 55:46.229
where your mind is moving with the wind, here
and there, just like a dead leaf.

55:51.259 --> 56:03.009
If a big train arrives, and the train is faced,
say – with a – some sort of an obstacle,

56:03.029 --> 56:05.389
it cannot stop.

56:05.869 --> 56:13.549
But if there’s a little worm and if it wants
to save itself from the train it can.

56:13.633 --> 56:17.549
It can hide itself away somewhere.

56:19.019 --> 56:20.669
You are not a worm.

56:20.779 --> 56:22.799
You are a human being.

56:23.571 --> 56:26.579
A little living thing can do that much.

56:28.999 --> 56:35.659
You are a human being and if you cannot stop
yourself from your destruction,

56:39.643 --> 56:42.099
then who can stop you?

56:45.523 --> 56:50.553
You see the nature: people live together.

56:50.531 --> 56:56.531
Tiger lives in a forest and there are many
creatures who exist, too.

57:01.662 --> 57:08.272
But if human beings cannot save themselves
with all the brain that they have, their dynamic

57:08.282 --> 57:13.882
styles you see, with all the energy that they
have, with all the discoveries that they have

57:13.912 --> 57:20.032
made, then who is going to save mankind?

57:24.006 --> 57:31.266
Either you aggress on others or you kill yourself:
and then what should Mataji do?

57:31.290 --> 57:38.040
Or what should anyone do under these circumstances
– but to make you face it?

57:47.107 --> 57:51.937
In Sahaja Yoga, you can face it very clearly.

57:52.606 --> 57:57.167
You can see others doing it also, but first,
you must see it in yourself.

57:57.387 --> 58:01.727
Unless and until you see it in yourself what
you are doing to yourself, you cannot see

58:01.720 --> 58:02.720
in others.

58:08.893 --> 58:12.043
When I say “you see it in yourself” you
become self-centered.

58:12.053 --> 58:14.933
I mean, anything You say can be twisted.

58:15.973 --> 58:20.793
When I say “you see it in yourself”, that
means you detach yourself and see in yourself:

58:20.805 --> 58:22.583
what is your mind doing?

58:22.742 --> 58:27.455
That’s how you can love others also that
they are doing the same.

58:28.925 --> 58:34.505
Like a person, say, is fond of good food all
the time.

58:35.680 --> 58:40.570
If he can see that he is hankering after good
food all the time, he is thinking about good

58:40.600 --> 58:44.560
food, his mind is working like that – if
he can see that he can correct it also.

58:44.604 --> 58:45.750
If he can see it.

58:46.014 --> 58:55.704
Apart from that, when he sees somebody doing
it, he would not hate that person, but he

58:55.726 --> 58:57.844
would help him to cure.

58:59.260 --> 59:05.636
On the contrary, I have seen those who are
like that, hate the other person, make fun

59:05.656 --> 59:09.546
of the other person, while they have the same
weakness.

59:11.948 --> 59:13.648
Why, why it happens?

59:13.728 --> 59:16.778
There’s a, there’s a psychological reason.

59:18.268 --> 59:26.021
Because that point which is doing like this,
wrong in him – you hate that point in you,

59:26.051 --> 59:33.248
subconsciously, and that’s what you hate
in others; but that is consciously.

59:33.488 --> 59:39.348
If you hate that part in you consciously,
there wouldn’t be any problem.

59:42.118 --> 59:47.438
That part which is negative, the part that
is telling you all these things, the part

59:47.436 --> 59:53.511
that misleads you, the part that spoils you,
the part that covers the Self – you see

59:53.561 --> 01:00:04.011
– in you, if you could manage to see that
and say: “No, not that part, no."

01:00:04.045 --> 01:00:09.151
But then you start despising the rule (unclear
word).

01:00:09.201 --> 01:00:13.461
It’s a very subtle thing: either you move
from this side to that side.

01:00:13.588 --> 01:00:17.318
If I try to push you, you’ll just go like
a spring to the other end.

01:00:17.418 --> 01:00:20.108
If I try to push on that side like a spring
you go to the other end.

01:00:20.168 --> 01:00:24.438
Thing is, the basic thing is the extremes
are to be avoided.

01:00:24.688 --> 01:00:31.243
This is the basic point is: extremes to be
avoided.

01:00:34.243 --> 01:00:39.323
If you feel you are getting negative, take
your shoe and beat yourself nicely.

01:00:39.413 --> 01:00:50.462
Go out and shout or take a pillow and hit
it hard, alright?

01:00:52.115 --> 01:00:55.268
But if you are negative inside, what you will
do you will go and beat your wife or beat

01:00:55.298 --> 01:00:58.988
your husband, whatever may be the case.

01:01:07.425 --> 01:01:15.383
It’s a very simple thing for a Sahaja Yogi
to do, is to be amused about yourself.

01:01:15.551 --> 01:01:17.501
Just be amused: “Look at this Mr.

01:01:17.527 --> 01:01:19.421
So and So, now it’s me."

01:01:20.981 --> 01:01:24.551
When you start seeing yourself like that,
you see, be amused at yourself.

01:01:26.061 --> 01:01:27.641
“Ah, so now, Mr.

01:01:27.641 --> 01:01:30.521
So and So is coming up like this!

01:01:30.761 --> 01:01:34.306
Oh, come along, come along, now the vanity,
come along!

01:01:34.481 --> 01:01:37.176
I would like to see the vanity that I am.

01:01:38.676 --> 01:01:39.846
See Mr.

01:01:39.926 --> 01:01:41.576
Ego coming up.

01:01:41.616 --> 01:01:42.616
Now, here Mr.

01:01:42.606 --> 01:01:43.646
Ego stands."

01:01:43.656 --> 01:01:44.546
(Laughter)

01:01:44.536 --> 01:01:47.666
Then (Shri Mataji laughs) you will start seeing.

01:01:47.686 --> 01:01:51.436
Be amused about it in the real sense, and
you will be surprised that these things will

01:01:51.466 --> 01:01:52.466
drop out.

01:01:57.696 --> 01:02:01.786
Yogi (not clearly audible): You know this,
I mean when You observe something, and You

01:02:01.846 --> 01:02:03.496
say what You observed….

01:02:03.476 --> 01:02:04.476
(rest is indistinct).

01:02:04.509 --> 01:02:06.892
Shri Mataji: Yes, yes, of course, very much
so.

01:02:06.924 --> 01:02:07.549
Yes.

01:02:07.534 --> 01:02:08.699
Yogi: You’ll say that…

01:02:08.734 --> 01:02:09.259
Shri Mataji: Yes.

01:02:09.284 --> 01:02:10.849
Yogi: But we – but we’ll still not correct
it.

01:02:10.854 --> 01:02:11.804
What’s wrong?

01:02:11.854 --> 01:02:16.244
Shri Mataji: No, you should say: “Get away,
you take two running jumps and go away”.

01:02:24.979 --> 01:02:25.979
That will help Me.

01:02:28.485 --> 01:02:35.025
If you want to have phraseologies, I can tell
you, but I think you are much more equipped

01:02:35.028 --> 01:02:40.205
in English language with all the beautiful
humour that have – you have.

01:02:42.330 --> 01:02:44.765
Just play that on yourself, you see.

01:02:44.780 --> 01:02:51.130
Humour is a beautiful thing that you can really
play on yourself, instead of playing these

01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:58.280
melancholy songs (laughter) and foolishly
indulging into all this romantic nonsense.

01:02:58.450 --> 01:02:59.450
(Laughter)

01:03:00.970 --> 01:03:04.885
Better play some humour on yourself, sit down,
(with a deep sense of humour?

01:03:04.892 --> 01:03:08.357
– Not clear) and enjoy the humour upon yourself.

01:03:13.562 --> 01:03:15.452
It works wonders, you see.

01:03:21.102 --> 01:03:24.742
And those who know how to laugh at themselves
are the best people.

01:03:27.702 --> 01:03:28.702
[Tape cut]

01:03:29.702 --> 01:03:38.853
All that was foolish is chiselled out and
you see the beautiful joy-giving Spirit manifesting

01:03:38.863 --> 01:03:41.553
itself beautifully within you alone.

01:03:42.823 --> 01:03:47.507
And all your worries, all your problems and
all negativity and so-called aggressiveness

01:03:47.517 --> 01:03:51.417
and everything just disappears and you are
one with that.

01:03:51.617 --> 01:03:56.987
And you are seeing through (all?) that, the
brilliance that it is giving.

01:03:57.042 --> 01:04:01.092
You are seeing through and feeling the dignity
of that and the joy of it, the brilliance

01:04:01.079 --> 01:04:02.042
it is giving.

01:04:02.089 --> 01:04:05.009
Just think, if you are the sun and you come.

01:04:05.009 --> 01:04:11.499
And you see the sun coming, the rays coming
and working it out and curing and changing

01:04:11.499 --> 01:04:13.682
the colours and giving life.

01:04:13.709 --> 01:04:19.457
Imagine, how dignified you feel and how beautiful
you feel.

01:04:19.547 --> 01:04:22.487
But you don’t feel vain about it.

01:04:22.607 --> 01:04:26.637
If you are that you just don’t feel that
there’s something special about it.

01:04:26.737 --> 01:04:27.837
You just see it.

01:04:30.065 --> 01:04:33.457
Vanity comes when you don’t have something.

01:04:33.497 --> 01:04:36.435
When you have it, you say: “It’s alright,
it’s me”.

01:04:36.471 --> 01:04:37.563
It’s just flowing.

01:04:37.571 --> 01:04:42.424
It’s just watching how it’s beautifully
it is flowing.

01:04:44.764 --> 01:04:52.514
Because of scientific research in the psychological
sphere, this myth has come to us that if we

01:04:52.544 --> 01:04:56.424
try to enjoy something like that then you’ll
become proud.

01:04:56.634 --> 01:04:58.217
So you just don’t enjoy.

01:04:58.234 --> 01:05:01.637
I mean the subtotal of the whole thing is
– psychologists – is this that you don’t

01:05:01.697 --> 01:05:03.667
enjoy anything in life.

01:05:03.897 --> 01:05:08.563
It’s the subtotal it comes to (She laughs).

01:05:08.643 --> 01:05:18.099
If it is not worked with a Realized soul,
with the compassion and love and proper understanding,

01:05:18.113 --> 01:05:19.599
it amounts to that.

01:05:20.457 --> 01:05:24.289
That you just don’t enjoy anything in life.

01:05:24.939 --> 01:05:28.245
You analyze everything: this way you are bad,
that way you are bad.

01:05:28.254 --> 01:05:30.635
This way you are wrong, that way you are wrong.

01:05:30.684 --> 01:05:34.429
So you are wrong completely, you should be
finished: you are good for nothing, useless,

01:05:34.454 --> 01:05:35.489
thrown away.

01:05:35.964 --> 01:05:47.934
End up in the lunatic asylums or in some other
wretched place, which is not meant for human

01:05:47.994 --> 01:05:49.154
habitation at all.

01:05:56.474 --> 01:05:58.134
Idiotic it is, I must say.

01:05:58.324 --> 01:05:59.526
Stupid it is!

01:06:04.936 --> 01:06:14.493
It is like a – we call it in Marathi Dhoopatne,
is the thing we use for burning the incense,

01:06:14.513 --> 01:06:15.663
you see.

01:06:15.713 --> 01:06:20.926
It is hollow on this side and hollow on the
other side also because one side is the stand

01:06:20.956 --> 01:06:25.046
and the another side is where you put the
incense.

01:06:25.356 --> 01:06:29.207
So you take that Dhoopatna, and you ask for
something, you see.

01:06:29.377 --> 01:06:33.457
So something is given on this cup, you turn
it round for the other side.

01:06:33.497 --> 01:06:39.211
So, the other side you can see it, but see
this side that is filled in it’s gone, so

01:06:39.271 --> 01:06:42.891
you go to see, you want to see the other side
now, that what is left in the other one, it’s

01:06:42.921 --> 01:06:45.845
nothing is left altogether, it’s finished.

01:06:49.008 --> 01:06:55.538
So it is said that: ‘Hati Dhoopatne dene’
means this dhupatne is the thing is given

01:06:55.598 --> 01:06:56.918
to you in the hand.

01:06:56.928 --> 01:07:01.824
So first you see this side, you try to fill
the joy in the cup, alright?

01:07:01.984 --> 01:07:05.434
Then you turn it around to fill the other
side of it.

01:07:08.366 --> 01:07:12.336
But this side you receive it and the other
side is the support.

01:07:21.861 --> 01:07:25.074
So you need not go to the right, then to the
left.

01:07:25.071 --> 01:07:29.093
By the time you go to the left, the right
is over, and the right side you run up to,

01:07:29.103 --> 01:07:30.263
the left is over.

01:07:32.363 --> 01:07:34.109
Just be in the center!

01:07:41.873 --> 01:07:43.863
Push yourself in the center.

01:07:44.893 --> 01:07:45.893
Just be there.

01:07:56.167 --> 01:07:57.167
See the silence.

01:08:00.567 --> 01:08:02.265
Silence of joy crawls in.

01:08:02.257 --> 01:08:03.257
[Long silence]

01:08:10.325 --> 01:08:11.325
What’s it?

01:08:11.595 --> 01:08:12.809
What happens?

01:08:13.115 --> 01:08:17.385
[A yogi was asleep, exchanges on that, “Sleeping!”
people laugh]

01:08:20.576 --> 01:08:21.825
That’s the best!

01:08:23.236 --> 01:08:24.236
(A yogini says: “Still sleeping beautifully!”.)

01:08:24.236 --> 01:08:25.236
Eh?

01:08:39.031 --> 01:08:42.609
(More laughter and exchanges) That is the
best, this… (indistinct words).

01:08:50.054 --> 01:08:51.954
Now, any questions?

01:08:54.166 --> 01:08:57.384
Yogi: How far should we be concerned with
other people, Shri Mataji…

01:08:57.954 --> 01:08:59.514
Shri Mataji: What’s it?

01:08:59.994 --> 01:09:04.124
Yogi: (Not clearly audible) How far… should
we be concerned with other people, I mean,

01:09:04.204 --> 01:09:10.074
in a situation where are other people there
who should now better understand…

01:09:10.254 --> 01:09:11.434
Shri Mataji: Yes.

01:09:11.614 --> 01:09:15.974
Yogi: … (Unclear audio) And yet you know,
you are dependent for them on the stupid ones.

01:09:15.984 --> 01:09:16.984
(Shri Mataji laughs.

01:09:17.184 --> 01:09:20.089
The yogi continues speaking but it is not
clearly audible)

01:09:25.405 --> 01:09:26.405
Shri Mataji: Yes.

01:09:27.065 --> 01:09:33.076
I would say, you see, Regis, that you have
wisdom.

01:09:33.429 --> 01:09:35.926
All of you have your wisdom.

01:09:37.221 --> 01:09:44.186
And you tell them in a way that you carry
the [boat?] as they say.

01:09:44.843 --> 01:09:49.662
Because if you tell somebody: “You are stupid."

01:09:49.852 --> 01:09:52.882
I mean, he will make hell for Me.

01:09:54.982 --> 01:09:58.018
You’d better not do that (She laughs).

01:09:58.938 --> 01:10:00.178
Alright.

01:10:00.888 --> 01:10:05.245
Now, if you tell somebody that: “You are
very clever” when he is stupid (laughter)

01:10:05.298 --> 01:10:06.728
if he is really…

01:10:06.998 --> 01:10:11.508
Yogi (not clearly audible): When they think,
they know that, and then it’s not a stupid.

01:10:11.513 --> 01:10:14.273
Shri Mataji: Yes, they will know that, too.

01:10:14.273 --> 01:10:17.113
Because people here are very clever, you see.

01:10:17.133 --> 01:10:20.493
They are stupid in their wisdom.

01:10:20.513 --> 01:10:25.736
But understanding that – what others are
talking and all that, they know very well.

01:10:28.026 --> 01:10:32.356
So, best thing is whenever you have to work
on them, work on them secretly.

01:10:35.410 --> 01:10:39.006
Give them a bandhan, give them shoe-beating.

01:10:40.507 --> 01:10:42.766
But openly you give them tea.

01:10:43.966 --> 01:10:44.966
[Laughter.

01:10:44.966 --> 01:10:45.966
Yogi speaks…

01:10:45.966 --> 01:10:47.286
Vibrated…]

01:10:47.372 --> 01:10:51.126
Vibrated, of course, of course, of course,
of course.

01:10:52.457 --> 01:10:58.527
Keep Mataji’s photograph and a candle there
and then invite.

01:10:58.786 --> 01:10:59.786
Give them tea.

01:10:59.786 --> 01:11:01.467
Give them some chanas.

01:11:02.946 --> 01:11:06.247
You see, that’s how you have to work with
these people.

01:11:06.517 --> 01:11:10.197
Because they don’t understand this, they
may be clever.

01:11:11.447 --> 01:11:13.517
So, give them some Chanas.

01:11:14.123 --> 01:11:18.463
When they want to have some water, give them
vibrated water.
