00:08:42.989 --> 00:08:50.002
Now, we are starting a New Year,

00:08:50.203 --> 00:08:57.865
and I wish you all a very happy and prosperous New Year.

00:09:05.425 --> 00:09:17.912
In this wish of Mine I also wish you a very deep growth in Sahaja Yoga.

00:09:25.847 --> 00:09:36.318
Now you all are Sahaja Yogis and you all have to become masters in Sahaja Yoga.

00:09:36.534 --> 00:09:48.163
For becoming masters in Sahaja Yoga I am sure you are doing meditation, introspection

00:09:49.527 --> 00:09:55.885
and all kinds of Sahaja Yoga rituals, I should say.

00:10:00.627 --> 00:10:10.989
In this New Year, I’ll think there is greater chance

00:10:12.754 --> 00:10:16.926
for you to do much better,

00:10:17.644 --> 00:10:25.433
because all those years of ordeals are over.

00:10:30.519 --> 00:10:40.302
We are now entering into the New Era. I say now the Satya Yuga is established.

00:10:45.528 --> 00:10:52.343
In the beginning you may not feel the atmosphere

00:10:53.083 --> 00:10:58.484
of Kali Yuga being cleared out completely.

00:10:58.685 --> 00:11:05.638
Of course, gradually you’ll find that’s all clearing out

00:11:05.839 --> 00:11:13.624
and all the people who are dangerous for your spiritual life,

00:11:13.825 --> 00:11:24.272
for your national life, for your family life, will have to take back their way;

00:11:24.473 --> 00:11:28.030
they cannot be successful here.

00:11:35.638 --> 00:11:42.999
Now the Sahaja Yogis have to decide how far they will spread Sahaja Yoga all over.

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:47.451
How many people can get into Sahaja Yoga?

00:11:47.652 --> 00:11:54.171
There should be many more waiting for you this year,

00:11:54.372 --> 00:12:01.171
and maybe this year, if you all decide to work it out, I am sure

00:12:01.372 --> 00:12:09.537
you can get lots of people who will be saved from the curses of Kali Yuga.

00:12:09.738 --> 00:12:17.663
This is going to be your vow on the New Year day,

00:12:17.866 --> 00:12:25.015
that now we are going to start Sahaja Yoga in a new way,

00:12:25.216 --> 00:12:29.388
in a bigger way, in a more dynamic way.

00:12:29.589 --> 00:12:37.492
For that, first thing is needed is your Sangha Shakti, that is your collectivity.

00:12:37.693 --> 00:12:44.812
This collectivity has to be extremely well built-in, well made,

00:12:45.013 --> 00:12:50.544
well understood and absolutely loveable.

00:12:51.513 --> 00:12:58.124
This is not difficult in Sahaja Yoga, because practically all your jealousies,

00:12:58.325 --> 00:13:07.856
all your baser ideas have been completely washed out by your Kundalini.

00:13:08.057 --> 00:13:14.796
She has transformed you, you are different people; you are very, very different.

00:13:14.997 --> 00:13:23.584
Not only that, but you have now understood yourselves.

00:13:23.785 --> 00:13:29.624
You are knowing your Self. And all those who know their self

00:13:29.825 --> 00:13:33.313
cannot fight with each other.

00:13:34.474 --> 00:13:42.474
Because this Self is the reflection of one person,

00:13:42.675 --> 00:13:50.709
of one Deity, of one God. And so how can you fight?

00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:58.474
When He is within your heart, how can you fight with each other?

00:13:58.675 --> 00:14:02.452
When He, otherwise you’ll be fighting with yourself.

00:14:02.653 --> 00:14:07.046
It would be very, very stupid to do that.

00:14:07.247 --> 00:14:15.505
So all the fights and all the funny things that you have been thinking about

00:14:16.005 --> 00:14:21.591
will of course disappear, no doubt. But you’ll become very dynamic.

00:14:21.792 --> 00:14:26.029
You’ll be amazed at your dynamism. Just you have to rise;

00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:32.099
just you have to expect your Self to manifest.

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:38.898
You can become very, very collective, progressive

00:14:39.099 --> 00:14:43.528
and you can create many Sahaja Yogis.

00:14:43.729 --> 00:14:52.390
You have been given Realization; you have been given the knowledge of Realization;

00:14:52.591 --> 00:15:00.335
whatever was possible has been done for your health and prosperity,

00:15:00.536 --> 00:15:09.927
but now it’s your duty to repay to the Divine by your creative methods.

00:15:10.128 --> 00:15:13.513
You have to be very creative.

00:15:13.714 --> 00:15:21.780
You'll find so many people in this world are full of lots of problems,

00:15:21.981 --> 00:15:28.412
which you have got out of it. But you can help them.

00:15:28.613 --> 00:15:33.411
You don’t need any help because you are yourself full of power –

00:15:33.612 --> 00:15:40.539
power of Divinity within you. This Divine power should be used.

00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:46.453
It’s not given just to be rusted. This power has to be used.

00:15:46.653 --> 00:15:50.704
Otherwise what’s the use of becoming powerful?

00:15:50.905 --> 00:15:55.736
Supposing we have electrical power here, and it doesn’t even give light,

00:15:55.937 --> 00:15:59.556
so what’s the use of having electrical power?

00:15:59.757 --> 00:16:05.649
So the power that you have is for the emancipation of human beings.

00:16:08.106 --> 00:16:15.853
It is for you to raise the Kundalini of people – you can do it.

00:16:16.054 --> 00:16:19.040
One person can do it for thousands!

00:16:19.241 --> 00:16:25.541
And I hope now you take up this responsibility upon yourself.

00:16:25.742 --> 00:16:31.597
This would be the greatest blessing for you, for Sahaja Yoga

00:16:31.798 --> 00:16:39.550
and for the whole world. Because in My vision, we have to change the whole world.

00:16:39.751 --> 00:16:43.495
I don’t know in My lifetime if I can achieve it or not.

00:16:43.696 --> 00:16:47.283
But if you people really join hands with Me,

00:16:47.484 --> 00:16:53.097
with full effort, it will work out.

00:16:53.298 --> 00:17:02.589
Firstly I hear many people don’t go to meditation, into collective meditation.

00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:10.519
They do not join together. It’s surprising after so many years of work I’ve done –

00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:16.277
thirty years I’ve been working, and there are some, some people

00:17:16.478 --> 00:17:23.236
who take Sahaja Yoga for granted. You don’t understand your responsibility.

00:17:23.437 --> 00:17:27.714
You have to meditate collectively.

00:17:27.915 --> 00:17:32.837
Whenever there is collective meditation you must join that.

00:17:33.038 --> 00:17:41.251
You can also start something in your areas, a collective meditation.

00:17:41.452 --> 00:17:47.501
And it will work out. Many people who are in Sahaja Yoga

00:17:47.702 --> 00:17:51.337
are now meditating, I can make them out.

00:17:51.538 --> 00:17:55.736
I know who are the ones who are meditating and who are not.

00:17:55.937 --> 00:17:59.597
It’s not difficult to make it out. And then you come out

00:17:59.798 --> 00:18:05.152
with other problems like my mother’s, father’s, uncle’s – this thing.

00:18:05.353 --> 00:18:11.339
There’s no need to worry about that. Even if you are a realized soul,

00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:18.556
and when you are connected with the Divine, even your own wish will be fulfilled.

00:18:18.757 --> 00:18:26.839
But it does not. Why? Because you still do not understand what you have become.

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:33.384
You first try giving Realizations to others. See what joy you feel.

00:18:33.585 --> 00:18:38.855
Tremendous joy. This joy you cannot get in anything else.

00:18:39.056 --> 00:18:43.743
Whatever you may buy, whatever you may have,

00:18:43.944 --> 00:18:48.323
you cannot get this joy of giving Realization.

00:18:48.524 --> 00:18:53.995
And you will be so very happy; not because you expect anything,

00:18:54.196 --> 00:19:00.800
you want anything, nothing of the kind – but only thing is pure joy –

00:19:01.001 --> 00:19:08.572
pure joy of creating great Sahaja Yogis. This is what you are there.

00:19:08.773 --> 00:19:17.777
This is what the Divine wants you to do. Not just to take advantage of Divine power:

00:19:17.978 --> 00:19:22.839
“Cure my father, cure my mother, cure my sister… ”

00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:27.370
or else, “I haven’t got properties…” Then somebody says,

00:19:27.571 --> 00:19:34.120
“My husband ill-treats me…” or some wife says that… so the husband says this...

00:19:34.321 --> 00:19:37.541
It’s going on and on and on. Forget it!

00:19:37.742 --> 00:19:41.487
You are now above everything, above all these things.

00:19:41.688 --> 00:19:46.917
And you have become absolutely powerful, believe Me.

00:19:47.118 --> 00:19:52.525
If you haven’t used your power, then how will you know what powers you have got?

00:19:52.726 --> 00:19:57.402
It’s as simple as that. Those who have used it

00:19:57.603 --> 00:20:02.519
go on telling Me what miracles they had, what things have happened to them,

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:08.587
how they were protected, whatever they wanted – how they got it.

00:20:08.978 --> 00:20:15.683
But see, in Sahaja Yoga you cannot be hypocritical. If you have hypocrisy,

00:20:15.884 --> 00:20:19.072
Sahaja Yoga knows, the Divine knows you are a hypocritical.

00:20:19.273 --> 00:20:24.464
It is for your good, for your growth you have to be in Sahaja Yoga.

00:20:24.665 --> 00:20:28.839
It’s not for somebody else that you are doing it, but for yourself.

00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:36.316
When people are that powerful I am amazed, how they easily they can get cured.

00:20:36.517 --> 00:20:41.369
But they must meditate, and they must join collective meditation.

00:20:41.570 --> 00:20:46.048
Most of the people don’t join collective meditation. I am surprised.

00:20:46.249 --> 00:20:51.437
I know, sometimes, say in Delhi, there is no sufficient space,

00:20:51.638 --> 00:20:56.485
so people have to come twice, either Saturday or Sunday;

00:20:56.686 --> 00:20:59.887
some of them have to wait outside – doesn’t matter.

00:21:00.905 --> 00:21:04.251
But going for the collective meditation,

00:21:04.452 --> 00:21:10.649
you’ll be amazed that Divinity is flowing there. Vibrations are flowing there.

00:21:10.850 --> 00:21:18.218
I am there. It’s not that you are just going there just as a ritual.

00:21:18.452 --> 00:21:26.413
Problem is you people don’t realize that you have to be responsible for Sahaja Yoga,

00:21:26.614 --> 00:21:33.626
responsible for giving Realizations to others and attend

00:21:33.827 --> 00:21:40.976
all the programs you have of meditation.

00:21:41.177 --> 00:21:45.517
With collective meditation you get all right.

00:21:45.718 --> 00:21:52.091
All your problems are solved if you go to the collective meditation regularly –

00:21:52.292 --> 00:21:58.728
I promise you! But the problem is you won’t go; you will write letters to Me,

00:21:58.929 --> 00:22:04.062
you want to meet Me. This is not going to help.

00:22:04.263 --> 00:22:09.306
You may come and trouble Me like that, or do something like that, but doesn’t help.

00:22:09.507 --> 00:22:19.249
What helps that you help yourself. Next year is going to be a great year for you.

00:22:20.304 --> 00:22:26.311
In the West now I was surprised how things are spreading fast.

00:22:26.593 --> 00:22:35.937
In Russia the people are so deep – so deep.

00:22:36.138 --> 00:22:43.281
Once they get Realization, they understand the value of Realization.

00:22:43.482 --> 00:22:49.063
They are so humble, and so deep, they don’t want anything.

00:22:49.264 --> 00:22:54.610
They’ve never desired for anything. Though they have gone through horrible

00:22:54.811 --> 00:23:01.859
problems of communism, and now this reaction to that.

00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:10.946
Despite that, all these five countries which I call as ‘real’

00:23:11.147 --> 00:23:18.233
Divine countries, because the way they have accepted it.

00:23:18.843 --> 00:23:22.585
They are poor according to the modern standards,

00:23:22.786 --> 00:23:27.561
but from their heart they are very, very rich.

00:23:27.835 --> 00:23:34.077
From their understanding of Sahaja Yoga, they are very, very rich.

00:23:34.278 --> 00:23:40.609
And their scientists are so well qualified. In every type of thing now,

00:23:40.810 --> 00:23:48.063
there is one scientist who has come to India and who has discovered a method

00:23:48.264 --> 00:23:53.407
by which you can see all the chakras, and the Kundalini

00:23:53.608 --> 00:23:59.493
and the obstructions and everything – something he can show you.

00:23:59.694 --> 00:24:07.509
While our scientists are busy opposing Me. Little knowledge is very dangerous.

00:24:07.710 --> 00:24:11.437
They don’t want to see what I am doing and how I am doing it.

00:24:11.638 --> 00:24:17.735
They just want to criticize Me – all so-called intellectuals.

00:24:17.936 --> 00:24:20.109
Especially in Maharashtra,

00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:24.571
the intellectuals – I think they are something has gone wrong with their heads.

00:24:24.772 --> 00:24:30.392
They cannot understand Sahaja Yoga. Just beyond them.

00:24:30.593 --> 00:24:36.790
What has happened to them I don’t know, but they just can’t understand Sahaja Yoga.

00:24:36.991 --> 00:24:42.392
And these Maharashtrians are so busy with their rituals.

00:24:42.593 --> 00:24:46.398
Four o’clock in the morning they’ll get up, take their baths, do this,

00:24:46.599 --> 00:24:51.517
then start doing their Pujas, this, that.

00:24:51.718 --> 00:24:56.156
Now somebody got sick, so his wife writes to Me,

00:24:56.357 --> 00:24:59.718
“We didn’t go to any temple, we didn’t do any rituals,

00:24:59.919 --> 00:25:02.953
still my husband has got sick.” Imagine.

00:25:03.154 --> 00:25:07.704
As if doing by that you mean you are a real Sahaja Yogi.

00:25:07.905 --> 00:25:12.235
If you are a real Sahaja Yogi, then nothing can happen to you.

00:25:12.436 --> 00:25:16.329
But you have been just under wrong impression.

00:25:16.530 --> 00:25:21.760
Whether you go to temple, or whether you go to wrong places

00:25:21.961 --> 00:25:29.104
and do all kinds of rituals – it has never helped anyone.

00:25:29.305 --> 00:25:35.713
So first you have to empty yourself. If you are already filled with these ideas,

00:25:35.914 --> 00:25:41.250
these age old ideas, and you are still carrying on with them,

00:25:41.451 --> 00:25:43.635
how can the Divine be filled?

00:25:43.836 --> 00:25:50.104
If there’s a pot already full of water or anything – you cannot fill it.

00:25:50.305 --> 00:25:58.055
So you have to empty it completely. Empty yourself, empty your mind.

00:25:58.256 --> 00:26:06.643
It’s possible through Sahaja Yoga if you can take your Kundalini beyond Agnya chakra.

00:26:06.844 --> 00:26:12.229
By not reacting! Reaction is the worst thing,

00:26:12.430 --> 00:26:18.252
because reaction comes through your Agnya, as I told you the other day,

00:26:18.453 --> 00:26:27.047
and it is due to your conditioning or due to your ego.

00:26:27.248 --> 00:26:32.104
So some people react because of their conditioning,

00:26:32.305 --> 00:26:41.432
and some people react because of their ego. So why should you react to anything?

00:26:41.633 --> 00:26:46.338
Why don’t you enjoy – by not reacting. You just watch.

00:26:46.539 --> 00:26:53.572
See how beautifully they have made beautiful flowers – just enjoy it.

00:26:53.773 --> 00:26:58.033
What is the need – some will find some faults, somebody will say

00:26:58.234 --> 00:27:01.172
this should not have been there, how did they manage this,

00:27:01.373 --> 00:27:08.775
all kinds of nonsensical things. The joy of its creation is there.

00:27:08.976 --> 00:27:14.361
And you should be able to see it, feel it, enjoy it.

00:27:14.562 --> 00:27:19.640
Then you are a Sahaja Yogi. Otherwise you are not.

00:27:19.841 --> 00:27:25.735
If you are a reacting type, you cannot be a Sahaja Yogi.

00:27:25.936 --> 00:27:30.243
This is a degree – Sahaja Yoga is –

00:27:30.444 --> 00:27:36.531
I think there are so many various styles of Sahaja Yogis.

00:27:36.859 --> 00:27:43.846
Somebody is just minor, somebody a little plus, somebody’s like that.

00:27:44.047 --> 00:27:49.758
But the depth of the Sahaja Yogi is

00:27:49.959 --> 00:27:55.643
to be measured by the way he keeps joyous and happy.

00:27:55.844 --> 00:28:00.846
Goes on criticizing others, go on getting angry with others,

00:28:01.047 --> 00:28:05.898
all these things are going on, and he thinks he’s a Sahaja Yogi.

00:28:06.109 --> 00:28:13.689
In our Divine University we have no degrees, we don’t give you certificates,

00:28:13.891 --> 00:28:16.814
you are a Sahaja Yogi, if you have got your Realization.

00:28:17.015 --> 00:28:22.781
If the Kundalini has burst opened here – it’s all right, you are a Sahaja Yogi.

00:28:22.982 --> 00:28:29.514
But that Sahaja Yogi may not be a real Sahaja Yogi.

00:28:29.715 --> 00:28:36.312
It only depends when you are joyous and you are anxious

00:28:36.513 --> 00:28:42.141
to give Realizations to others. You want to share your Realization,

00:28:42.342 --> 00:28:48.812
you just don’t want to keep it to yourself. If that is not your condition,

00:28:49.013 --> 00:28:52.998
then you are still not a full Sahaja Yogi.

00:28:53.199 --> 00:28:57.224
You should find out how many people you have given Realization.

00:28:57.425 --> 00:29:03.453
It’s very important. Because next year, as I’ve said, is a very important,

00:29:03.654 --> 00:29:08.983
very, very important year.

00:29:09.184 --> 00:29:19.477
In that year I would like to see all of you going round and giving Realization.

00:29:19.678 --> 00:29:26.674
While I’ve seen all these other false gurus who are getting exposed one by one.

00:29:27.534 --> 00:29:35.586
If you see their attitude, anywhere you meet them – once I was travelling

00:29:35.787 --> 00:29:40.021
by plane and there was a lady sitting next to Me, she was so hot.

00:29:40.222 --> 00:29:44.398
So I asked her, “What guru do you follow?” So she told Me the name.

00:29:44.599 --> 00:29:49.178
She said “He’s very good, this guru is the best” … this and that.

00:29:49.379 --> 00:29:53.742
Such heat coming from her body! I never said anything,

00:29:53.943 --> 00:30:00.586
but I was amazed how this lady was proudly talking about her guru

00:30:00.787 --> 00:30:08.594
who is such a bad man – and without knowing Me, I was just a stranger to her.

00:30:08.795 --> 00:30:12.787
But Sahaja Yogis don’t talk about it.

00:30:12.988 --> 00:30:19.021
You should talk to your neighbors, you should talk in your circle.

00:30:21.466 --> 00:30:28.445
Like, we have in India so many customs when we meet people:

00:30:28.646 --> 00:30:32.631
Like in India we do haldi kumkum in Maharashtra.

00:30:32.832 --> 00:30:37.632
They will never talk to those women who come for haldi kumkum about Sahaja Yoga.

00:30:37.833 --> 00:30:41.529
They won’t even have My photograph.

00:30:42.091 --> 00:30:44.912
If they want, they can do it. But they are -

00:30:45.113 --> 00:30:49.788
I don’t know what are they frightened about. It’s a very good chance.

00:30:49.972 --> 00:30:56.070
You have any dinner, you have any public meeting, anything.

00:30:56.271 --> 00:31:00.373
They won’t talk about Sahaja Yoga. It’s very surprising.

00:31:00.574 --> 00:31:02.513
They don’t want to talk about Sahaja Yoga

00:31:02.714 --> 00:31:06.968
that, “We have got this through Sahaja Yoga.”

00:31:07.169 --> 00:31:10.695
So how will Sahaja Yoga spread?

00:31:10.896 --> 00:31:18.109
One has to understand you all should find out how much responsible you have been

00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:23.281
for getting into Sahaja Yoga. Of course, you are all protected,

00:31:23.482 --> 00:31:33.038
you are all blessed, everyone has got whatever they wanted. Most of them.

00:31:33.239 --> 00:31:39.584
But how many of them are returning this debt?

00:31:39.785 --> 00:31:45.288
How many are working to give Realization to others?

00:31:45.489 --> 00:31:54.945
This is a debt on you. But if your attention is haphazard,

00:31:55.146 --> 00:32:03.810
if your attention is not clear, is not nirmal,

00:32:04.011 --> 00:32:14.265
then you are involved into all kinds of things like the tentacles of an octopus.

00:32:14.466 --> 00:32:16.998
You become like an octopus,

00:32:17.199 --> 00:32:22.062
you go on getting attached to this, attached to that, attached to that.

00:32:22.263 --> 00:32:30.513
You have to be a free bird. All these attachments that you have

00:32:31.833 --> 00:32:39.203
are going to take you nowhere. You should be only attached to Sahaja Yoga

00:32:39.404 --> 00:32:44.951
and should be conscious that you have known yourself.

00:32:45.152 --> 00:32:51.898
If you can just understand your value, your level,

00:32:52.099 --> 00:32:57.263
I can tell you – we can change the whole world!

00:32:57.464 --> 00:33:01.035
We have such a good heritage in this country;

00:33:01.227 --> 00:33:04.943
we have such good culture in this country.

00:33:05.144 --> 00:33:11.122
I have seen the problems of America and other places, we don’t have these problems.

00:33:11.323 --> 00:33:16.300
At least they’re not so prevalent.

00:33:16.501 --> 00:33:21.418
But only the thing that we have to do

00:33:22.073 --> 00:33:26.013
is to know you are a Sahaja Yogi.

00:33:26.214 --> 00:33:31.794
Like a tree – when it grows, it knows it’s a tree.

00:33:31.995 --> 00:33:38.005
It knows it has to produce roots, it has not come up ‘like that’.

00:33:38.206 --> 00:33:44.818
It has not been brought up just like a stick, no.

00:33:45.019 --> 00:33:52.294
It has to do something. In this world everything has to do something.

00:33:52.495 --> 00:33:56.988
But then what about Sahaja Yogis? It’s such a rare thing to happen

00:33:57.189 --> 00:34:02.497
that you have got your Realization. So where should we waste our attention?

00:34:02.698 --> 00:34:09.763
Why should we neglect our meditation? Why? We have to grow, we are a different people.

00:34:09.964 --> 00:34:15.824
We are a different race altogether in this world. We are realized souls.

00:34:16.025 --> 00:34:22.364
There were hardly any number during the time of Christ, practically nil.

00:34:22.565 --> 00:34:28.644
And even before that I was surprised that in China and other places,

00:34:28.845 --> 00:34:36.628
in one age there used to be one guru – one master. While you are so many masters,

00:34:36.829 --> 00:34:41.574
but you don’t want to use your power as a master.

00:34:41.775 --> 00:34:46.599
Why not the women use it also? I find women are more lethargic

00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:51.440
than men are in Sahaja Yoga. They should show – I am a woman Myself,

00:34:51.641 --> 00:34:55.855
single-handed I’ve done all this work; and why shouldn’t you do it?

00:34:56.056 --> 00:35:02.068
Because it’s a tremendous task to transform people all over the world.

00:35:02.269 --> 00:35:08.708
But it’s very easy for you – if I can do it, why can’t you do it?

00:35:08.909 --> 00:35:17.435
But put your complete attention to it that: ‘We are going to work out Sahaja Yoga,

00:35:17.636 --> 00:35:21.716
not for ourselves, but for the betterment of humanity.’

00:35:21.917 --> 00:35:26.793
We need it, we need it very much.

00:35:26.994 --> 00:35:33.286
Your compassion, your love, is all being wasted

00:35:33.487 --> 00:35:39.355
if you just think about yourself, your family – what’s the use?

00:35:39.837 --> 00:35:43.435
People do that even before Realization.

00:35:43.636 --> 00:35:50.152
So what is the use of completely getting attached to your families,

00:35:50.353 --> 00:35:56.207
attached to all other things? You should get attached to the whole world!

00:35:56.408 --> 00:36:01.988
You belong to the whole world now, you are no more individualistic.

00:36:02.189 --> 00:36:08.529
No more! Now, as I said, it’s a drop has become the ocean.

00:36:08.730 --> 00:36:16.005
Identify yourself with the ocean. Ocean is the lowest, if you have seen,

00:36:16.206 --> 00:36:22.105
lowest so much that the zero point starts from the ocean.

00:36:22.306 --> 00:36:28.505
Ocean is so humble. It’s the lowest point – it lives,

00:36:28.706 --> 00:36:32.355
but all the rivers flow into it.

00:36:32.556 --> 00:36:39.599
And the ocean does the work of throwing clouds in the sky.

00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:47.847
And these then burst and become rain falling to the same ocean.

00:36:48.048 --> 00:36:54.212
They come back to the same ocean. So those who are humble

00:36:54.413 --> 00:36:58.042
will attract more Sahaja Yogis.

00:36:58.243 --> 00:37:03.058
Those who are kind will attract much more Sahaja Yogis.

00:37:03.259 --> 00:37:08.409
So it is important to see that you change your temperament.

00:37:08.610 --> 00:37:14.400
If you try to show off, nobody is going to be impressed by you.

00:37:16.431 --> 00:37:23.495
If you think you are something very great, nobody is going to look at you.

00:37:23.696 --> 00:37:33.440
Be very humble, kind, generous – also very joyous person.

00:37:33.641 --> 00:37:38.072
Now imagine a Sahaja Yogi going in a group and telling them,

00:37:38.273 --> 00:37:44.986
“See, my mother is sick, my father is dying and this thing is happening,

00:37:45.187 --> 00:37:52.972
but I am doing Sahaja Yoga.” So people will say, “Why do you do Sahaja Yoga then?

00:37:53.173 --> 00:37:57.214
You go and cry and weep and sit down there!”

00:37:57.415 --> 00:38:05.261
If he’s really doing the Sahaja Yoga, no sickness can come, no trouble can come.

00:38:05.462 --> 00:38:10.720
It is a fact. Try to understand.

00:38:10.921 --> 00:38:17.722
With you only these people who are supposed to be there, they will rise.

00:38:17.923 --> 00:38:24.033
But no use having identification with people who are not Sahaja Yogis.

00:38:24.234 --> 00:38:27.595
They may be your relations, they may be anything. No use,

00:38:27.796 --> 00:38:31.392
because you are at a different level, they are at a different level.

00:38:31.593 --> 00:38:36.909
Either try to raise their level, or have nothing to do with them,

00:38:37.110 --> 00:38:42.565
because they will pull you down. They will not see your height,

00:38:42.766 --> 00:38:48.900
they have no eyes to see, they have no ear to hear,

00:38:49.101 --> 00:38:55.565
and they have no feelings of any kind. If they have seen how you are changed,

00:38:55.766 --> 00:39:03.299
how your life is changed, they would have gone absolutely head-long into Sahaja Yoga.

00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:09.144
But if they are not, that’s not your job. You shouldn’t bother about them.

00:39:09.345 --> 00:39:13.714
If they come to Sahaja Yoga, well and good, otherwise they are no your relations.

00:39:13.915 --> 00:39:18.563
In no way they are related to you. How will you relate Sahaja Yoga to them?

00:39:18.764 --> 00:39:22.744
How will you explain anything to them? It’s going to be impossible

00:39:22.945 --> 00:39:25.782
to talk to these people.

00:39:27.813 --> 00:39:32.675
So what I have to tell you today is that our family which is Sahaja Yoga,

00:39:32.876 --> 00:39:39.784
is large, it’s spread in 86 countries, and it’s doing very well.

00:39:39.985 --> 00:39:44.658
But what we have to see – that you do belong to that ocean,

00:39:44.859 --> 00:39:49.003
to the great families of Sahaja Yoga.

00:39:49.204 --> 00:39:55.282
But it is for you to increase the size of this.

00:39:55.493 --> 00:40:01.261
You have to increase, you have to talk about it, and you have to change people.

00:40:01.462 --> 00:40:10.565
This is your responsibility. You were not given Sahaja Yoga just for nothing,

00:40:10.766 --> 00:40:16.956
you have to produce greater Sahaja Yogis, better Sahaja Yogis;

00:40:17.157 --> 00:40:22.142
and you yourself meditate, not only meditate

00:40:22.343 --> 00:40:28.222
but also attend all the collective programs as far as possible.

00:40:28.423 --> 00:40:33.704
I am happy the way you have stayed on and have come here.

00:40:33.905 --> 00:40:42.690
It has rained – still you are here and you still are enjoying the Divine bliss.

00:40:42.891 --> 00:40:48.767
I again and again bless you from my heart, and I want you to have

00:40:48.968 --> 00:40:54.081
that Shuddha Iccha which is the Kundalini,

00:40:54.282 --> 00:41:02.323
want you to have that Shuddha Iccha that is the pure desire,

00:41:02.524 --> 00:41:08.675
not only to become Sahaja Yogis but to create more Sahaja Yogis.

00:41:08.876 --> 00:41:14.774
That is actually your pure desire. You may not have recognized it,

00:41:14.975 --> 00:41:20.784
but unless and until you fulfill that desire,

00:41:20.985 --> 00:41:25.571
you can never be a good Sahaja Yogi. It’s to spread Sahaja Yoga

00:41:25.772 --> 00:41:33.462
in every venue, in everywhere, in every one – that you can do it.

00:41:33.663 --> 00:41:38.972
And it will spread very well, and so many people can be saved.

00:41:39.173 --> 00:41:45.331
So many people who are just lost in the maya of stupidity

00:41:45.532 --> 00:41:48.431
will be back on the right path.

00:41:48.632 --> 00:41:53.206
How much good you are going to do for them you just think.

00:41:53.407 --> 00:41:57.688
If Me alone has brought so many Sahaja Yogis,

00:41:57.891 --> 00:42:05.159
why can’t you also try and get more Sahaja Yogis? This world needs Sahaja Yoga.

00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:09.050
The whole problem – whenever I see newspaper, I think, ‘Oh God,

00:42:09.251 --> 00:42:13.206
if these people were Sahaja Yogis, there would have been no problem’.

00:42:13.407 --> 00:42:19.204
But I find that still people are roaming about, and going round and round,

00:42:19.405 --> 00:42:25.009
I don’t know, as if they have no brains or they’ve no understanding

00:42:25.217 --> 00:42:31.289
that ‘where is this world going?’ and ‘Who’s going to save this world?’

00:42:32.073 --> 00:42:38.298
I am not here to tell you what you should do in your private life.

00:42:38.499 --> 00:42:42.616
But you yourself should know to keep yourself cleansed

00:42:42.817 --> 00:42:46.335
and beautiful, what you have to do to yourself.

00:42:46.536 --> 00:42:50.993
Some people are so superficial that it doesn’t go into their heads.

00:42:51.194 --> 00:42:54.587
Sahaja Yoga just doesn’t go into their heads – very, very superficial.

00:42:54.788 --> 00:42:59.899
So forget them. I don’t think they can be saved. So forget them,

00:43:00.100 --> 00:43:04.472
they cannot enjoy. They are worried about some nonsensical things always.

00:43:04.673 --> 00:43:09.657
So with such people you need not – but there are still so many people,

00:43:09.858 --> 00:43:17.057
at least I think 80% people, who are seeking and you should give them help.

00:43:17.258 --> 00:43:20.668
This is one thing, is the desire of your Mother

00:43:20.869 --> 00:43:24.615
that you should now take up Sahaja Yoga upon yourself

00:43:24.816 --> 00:43:28.699
and go on telling about this to everyone who comes.

00:43:28.900 --> 00:43:37.860
I mean I don’t want cheap popularity, but I do want Sahaja Yogis to be made everywhere.

00:43:38.494 --> 00:43:41.730
Now I am going to speak in Marathi.

00:43:41.931 --> 00:43:46.474
At our place, especially the women,

00:43:46.675 --> 00:43:50.046
they know all the festivals by heart.

00:43:50.477 --> 00:43:54.470
Everything is going on properly as per the festival,

00:43:54.671 --> 00:43:58.157
by getting up at 4 AM in the morning, have bath,

00:43:58.358 --> 00:44:01.365
filling up the old style copper water heater, then sitting down.

00:44:01.565 --> 00:44:03.943
Sitting for what? For Puja.

00:44:04.144 --> 00:44:08.412
And we, the people of Maharashtra are very ritualistic.

00:44:08.613 --> 00:44:11.205
In Delhi, it is better.

00:44:11.406 --> 00:44:13.912
There people are not so ritualistic.

00:44:14.113 --> 00:44:16.475
Hence lakhs of people have taken realization.

00:44:16.676 --> 00:44:19.753
But in Maharashtra it is not possible.

00:44:19.954 --> 00:44:25.133
They have to go to Pandharpur taking all sorts of trouble.

00:44:25.741 --> 00:44:30.682
And once you go to Pandhari then you cannot achieve Self Realization there.

00:44:31.367 --> 00:44:33.239
Actually one should get Realization.

00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:37.928
But, all those who go to Pandhari do not achieve Self Realization.

00:44:38.129 --> 00:44:40.768
On the contrary, they keep arguing against.

00:44:40.969 --> 00:44:46.392
Otherwise they proceed holding a big pot of basil on their head.

00:44:46.872 --> 00:44:49.465
Where are they going? To Alandi.

00:44:49.666 --> 00:44:52.745
What for? And who told you?

00:44:57.008 --> 00:44:59.975
Did Dnyaneshwara tell you?

00:45:00.468 --> 00:45:03.633
He did not have footwear on his feet,

00:45:03.834 --> 00:45:06.824
and these people take out his procession in a palanquin.

00:45:07.024 --> 00:45:09.126
They carry out the procession in a palanquin

00:45:09.325 --> 00:45:11.530
and eat food in every village.

00:45:11.731 --> 00:45:14.863
Means there is no self respect.

00:45:15.063 --> 00:45:18.118
In the name of Dnyaneshwar they go to every village

00:45:18.319 --> 00:45:20.889
and keep on consuming food.

00:45:21.414 --> 00:45:24.959
And the villagers think that they achieved punyas by this.

00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:27.512
But these people are beggars.

00:45:27.713 --> 00:45:29.410
They are beggars.

00:45:29.611 --> 00:45:32.317
They move around asking for alms on Dnyanadeva’s name.

00:45:32.518 --> 00:45:35.123
Why do you want to fill bellies of such people?

00:45:35.324 --> 00:45:39.800
What benefit are you going to get by feeding such beggars?

00:45:41.325 --> 00:45:45.606
In our Maharashtra, many such ill practices are continuing

00:45:45.807 --> 00:45:47.275
and there is no end to it.

00:45:47.476 --> 00:45:51.467
If you go on the road, you see them somewhere or the other.

00:45:51.668 --> 00:45:53.927
So all this should stop.

00:45:54.128 --> 00:45:57.906
You tell yourself and tell the others, "What nonsense is this?".

00:45:58.107 --> 00:46:02.518
Why do you do these things? In which scripture are they written?

00:46:02.971 --> 00:46:05.786
Did Dnyandeva write these things?

00:46:05.987 --> 00:46:09.156
Why do you do this? All these things should go away.

00:46:09.357 --> 00:46:11.422
Doing haldi kumkum function

00:46:11.623 --> 00:46:16.087
do you ever mention about Sahaja Yoga in that function?

00:46:16.288 --> 00:46:19.957
Once the ladies gather, they give oti offerings, do this, do that.

00:46:20.158 --> 00:46:22.673
Now if anyone gets prosperity, they give Oti offerings to Me.

00:46:22.874 --> 00:46:25.569
I said, „Do not give Me Oti”.

00:46:25.770 --> 00:46:28.251
They said they will visit the Devi temple and offer the Oti.

00:46:28.452 --> 00:46:30.086
„Not to Me. I do not want”.

00:46:30.287 --> 00:46:34.193
If you wish to do something, do Sahaja Yoga.

00:46:34.458 --> 00:46:37.765
Just offering Oti, what will happen due to this?

00:46:37.966 --> 00:46:40.404
I have no benefit from this neither you have.

00:46:40.610 --> 00:46:42.023
I am telling very clearly.

00:46:42.224 --> 00:46:45.229
If you wish to make the Oti offering, do it in the Devi temple.

00:46:45.430 --> 00:46:47.945
But now you should stop all this.

00:46:48.146 --> 00:46:50.249
Enough now!

00:46:50.908 --> 00:46:55.153
Now enter into yourself. There is so much wealth inside, aquire it.

00:46:55.354 --> 00:46:59.340
There have been so many great sadhus and saints here.

00:46:59.979 --> 00:47:02.534
What did they teach?

00:47:02.735 --> 00:47:04.776
Have they taught this to us?

00:47:04.977 --> 00:47:09.252
First of all stop all the rituals.

00:47:09.453 --> 00:47:13.514
If they do not do this, they will keep on making lamp wicks.

00:47:13.715 --> 00:47:16.832
Stop all the ritualism.

00:47:17.499 --> 00:47:22.263
And above all, they don't have special knowledge about these things.

00:47:23.754 --> 00:47:27.683
They just keep on doing whatever has been said by their forefathers.

00:47:27.884 --> 00:47:31.955
To do this women also drag the men in with them.

00:47:33.573 --> 00:47:36.152
Ladies have more wisdom

00:47:36.353 --> 00:47:38.842
and they nurture the society.

00:47:39.043 --> 00:47:41.754
But if she is possessed by this type of bhoot,

00:47:41.955 --> 00:47:45.682
then she believes whatever the Brahmin says about her issues - that’s it.

00:47:45.883 --> 00:47:48.289
But due to this the children also become useless.

00:47:48.490 --> 00:47:50.777
They waste their time by doing nothing.

00:47:50.978 --> 00:47:54.451
So don’t attend the haldi kumkum ceremony.

00:47:54.744 --> 00:47:59.740
Only if the lady who invites for haldi kumkum speaks about Sahaj Yoga too

00:47:59.941 --> 00:48:02.081
then only you should attend, otherwise don’t.

00:48:02.282 --> 00:48:03.893
You should be firm on this.

00:48:04.094 --> 00:48:06.764
Is it only that I want Sahaja Yoga or you also want it?

00:48:06.965 --> 00:48:09.430
And don’t others want it too?

00:48:09.593 --> 00:48:11.970
Why don’t you also tell them about Sahaja Yoga?

00:48:12.171 --> 00:48:14.561
You will not tell there,

00:48:15.330 --> 00:48:19.971
that we are Sahaja Yogis and what we all have achieved.

00:48:20.172 --> 00:48:22.234
Same thing with men also.

00:48:22.435 --> 00:48:25.313
They seem to be under the influence of ladies.

00:48:25.514 --> 00:48:29.067
In our Maharashtra there are two types of people.

00:48:29.268 --> 00:48:31.629
Either they are very ritualistic

00:48:31.805 --> 00:48:34.357
or they are "intelligent” -

00:48:34.558 --> 00:48:37.428
means stupid but so-called intelligent.

00:48:37.629 --> 00:48:41.232
And due to "intelligence" they do not understand what Sahaja Yoga is.

00:48:41.432 --> 00:48:44.492
Because they have such sharp intellect they do not understand,

00:48:44.693 --> 00:48:46.883
they feel that it is some other falsification.

00:48:47.084 --> 00:48:50.413
My dear fellow, just do it and understand it.

00:48:50.614 --> 00:48:55.931
That is why you will be surprised Maharashtra’s progress is very less.

00:48:56.132 --> 00:48:58.842
And I have made tremendous effort in Maharashtra.

00:48:59.043 --> 00:49:02.253
I have worked hard by visiting so many villages. I have toiled.

00:49:02.454 --> 00:49:04.643
Even after working so hard year after year,

00:49:04.844 --> 00:49:07.523
Maharashtra has not reached that state.

00:49:07.724 --> 00:49:10.979
What is this? What is the reason for this?

00:49:11.494 --> 00:49:15.943
I feel that ritualism should be discarded. Right away.

00:49:16.835 --> 00:49:20.535
Nothing doing. It is not at all needed.

00:49:20.736 --> 00:49:26.161
Secondly, the men should not use their intellect too much.

00:49:26.362 --> 00:49:29.114
But where is the intellect?

00:49:30.168 --> 00:49:33.801
What is the use of such intellect

00:49:34.002 --> 00:49:37.642
that takes you on the wrong path?

00:49:37.843 --> 00:49:44.096
The intellectuals in Maharashtra are worse than the ritualists.

00:49:44.796 --> 00:49:48.057
Means these people are confused and have lost their way.

00:49:48.272 --> 00:49:51.227
It is difficult for them to give up because everyone has ego.

00:49:51.428 --> 00:49:53.041
They think they are very special.

00:49:53.241 --> 00:49:56.738
They think there cannot be any incarnation in today's world.

00:49:56.939 --> 00:49:58.553
Because they are as such

00:49:58.754 --> 00:50:02.659
why would there be an incarnation between these donkey people?

00:50:02.860 --> 00:50:05.951
They have such ideas about themselves.

00:50:06.152 --> 00:50:08.683
So called intellectuals of here,

00:50:08.890 --> 00:50:13.476
have done foolish deeds which have no end.

00:50:13.677 --> 00:50:17.149
They don’t want to understand, they don't want to listen.

00:50:17.364 --> 00:50:20.711
Because of this type of mentality how would anything go inside them?

00:50:20.912 --> 00:50:23.914
Hence the wave of over intelligence that has come in Maharashtra

00:50:24.115 --> 00:50:25.870
is more dangerous.

00:50:26.071 --> 00:50:27.893
They write books after books.

00:50:28.093 --> 00:50:30.061
Whatever they write it is really a lot.

00:50:30.262 --> 00:50:33.163
And then people say, “I have read in the book”.

00:50:33.364 --> 00:50:35.612
Whatever is written in the books, is it truth?

00:50:35.813 --> 00:50:39.084
Who are these people to write? What experience do they have?

00:50:39.285 --> 00:50:41.298
You people should tell them straight away

00:50:41.499 --> 00:50:44.582
that you do not agree with these useless things.

00:50:44.783 --> 00:50:47.104
They keep on criticising everyone.

00:50:47.311 --> 00:50:50.779
They criticise Shri Krishna, criticise Shri Rama.

00:50:50.980 --> 00:50:55.255
If not that, they criticise all these sadhus and saints.

00:50:55.456 --> 00:50:57.738
And they say that all this is blind faith.

00:50:57.939 --> 00:51:01.061
You don’t have faith, then how will you have blind faith?

00:51:01.261 --> 00:51:05.673
The one who has faith in himself only will go deep in Sahaja Yoga.

00:51:06.983 --> 00:51:11.210
Why would a person without faith in himself join Sahaja Yoga?

00:51:11.411 --> 00:51:14.510
Hence, find out such people.

00:51:14.943 --> 00:51:18.442
Such absolutely good people exist in our country.

00:51:18.643 --> 00:51:21.920
You should help them.

00:51:22.121 --> 00:51:26.902
I think, in Maharashtra there is a need to do a lot of work.

00:51:27.161 --> 00:51:28.968
We are experts in fighting.

00:51:29.169 --> 00:51:33.116
That is why in politics we are always having fights, fights and fights.

00:51:33.317 --> 00:51:37.397
But in Sahaja Yoga, how many people are there

00:51:37.598 --> 00:51:44.359
who have dedicated themselves to fulfil their aims?

00:51:44.566 --> 00:51:46.592
How many people are there?

00:51:46.793 --> 00:51:49.815
If there is one leader, they will find faults in him.

00:51:50.015 --> 00:51:52.553
„He is like this, Mataji, he is like that”.

00:51:52.754 --> 00:51:55.926
Even if we keep this aside, apart leadership,

00:51:56.127 --> 00:51:59.250
still they will tell a lot of other things to Me, such as:

00:51:59.451 --> 00:52:01.032
"My grandmother is ill”.

00:52:01.233 --> 00:52:04.202
"Oh, dear, she may be old, she may be ill, it is OK.

00:52:04.403 --> 00:52:07.966
Why do you want to go to this side?”. "My grandmother” - means who?

00:52:08.167 --> 00:52:10.131
The entire world is your grandmother,

00:52:10.332 --> 00:52:13.208
the entire world your relation. You are Sahaja Yogi.

00:52:13.409 --> 00:52:17.369
"Your grandmother, your father, your mother" - how is it possible?

00:52:17.608 --> 00:52:20.517
Are you not on the top of the world?

00:52:20.718 --> 00:52:24.798
Your level has changed, right? You relatives have changed.

00:52:24.999 --> 00:52:28.819
In olden days, bramhin used to marry a bramhin only.

00:52:29.555 --> 00:52:31.569
Marriage into another caste was a taboo.

00:52:31.770 --> 00:52:35.304
Is it like that now? Everything has got mixed up.

00:52:35.551 --> 00:52:38.228
Then why should Sahaja Yogis think

00:52:38.429 --> 00:52:42.753
that, ”This is my mother and this is your mother”.

00:52:42.954 --> 00:52:45.607
"Mine” and "yours” are gone.

00:52:45.808 --> 00:52:47.877
Now the entire world is yours.

00:52:48.078 --> 00:52:50.734
Has Dnyaneshwar said anything like this ever?

00:52:50.935 --> 00:52:52.941
We have had so many sadhus and saints.

00:52:53.141 --> 00:52:54.966
Has Tukaram ever said anything like this?

00:52:55.166 --> 00:52:57.696
Have they ever differentiated like "mine" and "yours"?

00:52:57.896 --> 00:53:00.821
Just to keep on saying the verses written by these saints,

00:53:01.021 --> 00:53:05.622
the meaning does not go inside the brain because of they grind away.

00:53:05.823 --> 00:53:08.161
So leaving apart all these things,

00:53:08.362 --> 00:53:13.489
a person should be honest about oneself:

00:53:14.478 --> 00:53:16.471
„What am I doing to myself?

00:53:16.672 --> 00:53:18.478
What have I done for myself?

00:53:18.678 --> 00:53:20.252
What I want to do for myself?”.

00:53:20.452 --> 00:53:21.999
You must see that.

00:53:22.200 --> 00:53:27.040
And after that you will realize and will get enlightened.

00:53:27.271 --> 00:53:29.348
You are a Sahaj Yogi.

00:53:29.531 --> 00:53:32.660
Were there ever so many Sahaja Yogis in the world?

00:53:32.861 --> 00:53:35.566
Two-four were there and they (saints) were tortured by people.

00:53:35.766 --> 00:53:38.755
Still what beautiful poems they have written.

00:53:38.956 --> 00:53:42.925
You belong to such a place, whose name itself is "Maha-rashtra” (great land).

00:53:43.147 --> 00:53:47.644
How can you become small frogs after coming here?

00:53:49.153 --> 00:53:51.773
Now leave these relatives.

00:53:51.974 --> 00:53:56.656
And your relatives are only those who are realized (“Hechi soyare hoti”)

00:53:56.871 --> 00:53:58.924
as said by saint Dnyaneshwar.

00:53:59.125 --> 00:54:01.356
Only these are your relatives.

00:54:01.557 --> 00:54:06.177
None else is your relative, that is clearly mentioned.

00:54:06.378 --> 00:54:08.598
But one should realize that.

00:54:08.799 --> 00:54:13.269
People just keep on reading ”Pasaydaan” (song written by saint Dnyaneshwar), read it, learnt by heart.

00:54:13.470 --> 00:54:16.439
Just learn everything by heart, that’s it.

00:54:17.382 --> 00:54:21.064
They learn without retaining anything.

00:54:23.358 --> 00:54:26.368
So, the people from Maharashtra

00:54:26.566 --> 00:54:30.643
should observe themselves with a humouros attitude that,

00:54:30.844 --> 00:54:34.819
”What am I doing? What is my work?”.

00:54:35.020 --> 00:54:37.655
You should come to Delhi and see.

00:54:37.856 --> 00:54:40.763
There are two-three very good Maharshtrians who have arrived there.

00:54:40.964 --> 00:54:44.821
They say, "Mataji, you should invite people from Maharashtra only".

00:54:45.022 --> 00:54:47.248
They are very good people”. I said, „Is that right?

00:54:47.449 --> 00:54:50.632
Go there for a few days, then you will know”.

00:54:51.171 --> 00:54:53.767
In Sahaja Yoga to become deep you need an effort first.

00:54:53.968 --> 00:54:57.997
I don’t say you should go to Himalaya and stand on one foot. No.

00:54:58.198 --> 00:55:00.871
But, ”Where am I going? What am I doing?

00:55:01.072 --> 00:55:04.051
What am I living for?" That needs to be seen.

00:55:04.252 --> 00:55:06.987
Then only shower of blessings.

00:55:07.528 --> 00:55:12.756
Even for blessings, Sahastrara should be opened, completely.

00:55:12.956 --> 00:55:16.723
You must value yourself, but you don't.

00:55:16.924 --> 00:55:21.909
"Why it happened like this, that I don’t value myself?"

00:55:22.376 --> 00:55:27.064
We must decide that, "I am able do this, I am able to do that".

00:55:27.265 --> 00:55:31.874
And we should have big dreams

00:55:32.075 --> 00:55:35.492
that, "I will go to this place, that village to spread Sahaja Yoga".

00:55:35.683 --> 00:55:37.555
We should see such dreams.

00:55:37.756 --> 00:55:40.656
We should imagine such big things.

00:55:41.469 --> 00:55:45.265
You see, we, Indians, have accomplished so much work in the past.

00:55:45.466 --> 00:55:47.784
There was a queen of Jhansi. She was a woman.

00:55:47.985 --> 00:55:51.830
She said, "No, we will defeat the British people".

00:55:52.031 --> 00:55:55.619
She went to the war field taking her small child with her.

00:55:55.820 --> 00:55:57.473
And she died in the battlefield,

00:55:57.674 --> 00:56:01.100
but British people said, "Though we won over Jhansi,

00:56:01.301 --> 00:56:03.859
the glory is of Lakshmi Bai (the queen of Jhansi)".

00:56:04.060 --> 00:56:07.290
Such type of women were born in Maharashtra.

00:56:07.512 --> 00:56:11.161
And now, nothing of this kind is seen.

00:56:11.362 --> 00:56:13.838
Only decking up.

00:56:15.812 --> 00:56:19.858
Why I am saying this? Because I had bad experiences.

00:56:20.059 --> 00:56:23.906
Now all have started saying, "We don’t want Maharashtrian wife".

00:56:24.107 --> 00:56:26.374
These women misbehaved there.

00:56:26.575 --> 00:56:32.997
If I speak in Marathi others won't understand, but you will.

00:56:33.954 --> 00:56:35.812
These women went there and misbehaved

00:56:36.013 --> 00:56:38.462
and now they don’t want wife from Maharashtra.

00:56:38.662 --> 00:56:40.223
They have no education, nothing,

00:56:40.424 --> 00:56:42.911
still we married them thinking that it is our responsibility.

00:56:43.112 --> 00:56:45.611
But they brought ill fame to us only.

00:56:45.812 --> 00:56:49.508
Told you this as I have not complained to you untill today.

00:56:49.709 --> 00:56:53.297
I always kept on praising you, but it will not work now.

00:56:53.497 --> 00:56:57.121
Now I should see something concrete in front of Me.

00:56:57.322 --> 00:57:00.378
Hence next time I am going to ask everyone

00:57:00.579 --> 00:57:03.729
how many people you have given Realization to.

00:57:04.278 --> 00:57:08.377
In a way you are better than Gujaratis. They are very rigid.

00:57:08.578 --> 00:57:10.782
Sahaja Yoga is not going in their head.

00:57:10.982 --> 00:57:14.868
But even if it enters into your head, it is a waste.

00:57:15.966 --> 00:57:20.814
So, today everyone should make a resolution in their minds

00:57:21.014 --> 00:57:23.019
that, "Mataji, next time when you come here

00:57:23.220 --> 00:57:25.736
we will show you what all can be done in Maharashtra.

00:57:25.937 --> 00:57:28.297
Where have the valiant Marathas (warriors of Maharashtra) gone?

00:57:28.498 --> 00:57:30.592
Don’t know what happened.

00:57:30.793 --> 00:57:33.105
With the help of these warriors so much was accomplished.

00:57:33.306 --> 00:57:38.428
And you people are so educated good people, everything proper

00:57:38.629 --> 00:57:41.375
and you are of no help to Me.

00:57:42.740 --> 00:57:45.239
Hence this number should increase.

00:57:45.440 --> 00:57:49.264
And not only this, you should also progress.

00:57:49.465 --> 00:57:52.670
And I should see that in Maharashtra,

00:57:52.871 --> 00:57:55.467
Sahaja Yoga should reach the peak.

00:57:55.668 --> 00:57:57.689
Reach the summit.

00:57:57.890 --> 00:58:00.903
There is nothing to be said beyond this.

00:58:01.104 --> 00:58:03.065
It should be like this.

00:58:03.266 --> 00:58:06.192
Just make me speechless.

00:58:06.393 --> 00:58:08.161
How happy I will be if this happens.

00:58:08.361 --> 00:58:10.168
I was born here.

00:58:10.369 --> 00:58:13.686
And I studied everything in Marathi language.

00:58:13.887 --> 00:58:17.917
Even today I know Marathi quite well.

00:58:18.118 --> 00:58:21.940
But I cannot understand the minds of the Marathi people.

00:58:22.141 --> 00:58:25.321
I cannot understand the minds of Marathi people.

00:58:25.522 --> 00:58:30.033
Because my father and mother were of a very high caliber,

00:58:30.234 --> 00:58:34.683
due to them, I did not know that such people exist in Maharashtra.

00:58:34.883 --> 00:58:39.898
Similarly you should prove, "Mataji we are special.

00:58:40.208 --> 00:58:43.489
You entrusted us with such great responsibility.

00:58:43.689 --> 00:58:48.590
And we will prove it you that Maharashtra is no less".

00:58:48.791 --> 00:58:53.074
You are all great warriors,

00:58:53.275 --> 00:58:55.238
and now is the time to show your bravery.

00:58:55.439 --> 00:58:57.222
Just being Marathi means what?

00:58:57.423 --> 00:59:00.683
Just to call oneself Maharashtrian is a waste.

00:59:00.884 --> 00:59:04.573
That is the opinion of people about you.

00:59:04.774 --> 00:59:06.215
It should not be like this.

00:59:06.416 --> 00:59:09.227
Hence understand Sahaja Yoga completely,

00:59:09.428 --> 00:59:15.569
practise it and make Maharashtra proud.

00:59:18.033 --> 00:59:24.362
I say that with infinite blessings to you.

00:59:24.563 --> 00:59:27.255
Please accept it.
