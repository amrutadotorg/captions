WEBVTT

08:43.240 --> 08:50.253
Now, we are starting a New Year,

08:50.454 --> 08:58.116
and I wish you all a very happy and
prosperous New Year.

09:05.676 --> 09:18.163
In this wish of Mine I also wish you a very
deep growth in Sahaja Yoga.

09:26.098 --> 09:36.569
Now you all are Sahaja Yogis and you all
have to become masters in Sahaja Yoga.

09:36.785 --> 09:48.414
For becoming masters in Sahaja Yoga I am
sure you are doing meditation, introspection

09:49.778 --> 09:56.136
and all kinds of Sahaja Yoga rituals,
I should say.

10:00.878 --> 10:11.240
In this New Year, I’ll think there is
greater chance

10:13.005 --> 10:17.177
for you to do much better,

10:17.895 --> 10:25.684
because all those years of ordeals are
over.

10:30.770 --> 10:40.553
We are now entering into the New Era. I say
now the Satya Yuga is established.

10:45.779 --> 10:52.594
In the beginning you may not feel
the atmosphere

10:53.334 --> 10:58.735
of Kali Yuga being cleared out completely.

10:58.936 --> 11:05.889
Of course, gradually you’ll find that’s all
clearing out

11:06.090 --> 11:13.875
and all the people who are dangerous
for your spiritual life,

11:14.076 --> 11:24.523
for your national life, for your family
life, will have to take back their way;

11:24.724 --> 11:28.281
they cannot be successful here.

11:35.889 --> 11:43.250
Now the Sahaja Yogis have to decide how far
they will spread Sahaja Yoga all over.

11:43.451 --> 11:47.702
How many people can get into Sahaja Yoga?

11:47.903 --> 11:54.422
There should be many more waiting for you
this year,

11:54.623 --> 12:01.422
and maybe this year, if you all decide to
work it out, I am sure

12:01.623 --> 12:09.788
you can get lots of people who will be
saved from the curses of Kali Yuga.

12:09.989 --> 12:17.914
This is going to be your vow on the New
Year day,

12:18.117 --> 12:25.266
that now we are going to start Sahaja Yoga
in a new way,

12:25.467 --> 12:29.639
in a bigger way, in a more dynamic way.

12:29.840 --> 12:37.743
For that, first thing is needed is your
Sangha Shakti, that is your collectivity.

12:37.944 --> 12:45.063
This collectivity has to be extremely well
built-in, well made,

12:45.264 --> 12:50.795
well understood and absolutely loveable.

12:51.764 --> 12:58.375
This is not difficult in Sahaja Yoga,
because practically all your jealousies,

12:58.576 --> 13:08.107
all your baser ideas have been completely
washed out by your Kundalini.

13:08.308 --> 13:15.047
She has transformed you, you are different
people; you are very, very different.

13:15.248 --> 13:23.835
Not only that, but you have now understood
yourselves.

13:24.036 --> 13:29.875
You are knowing your Self. And all those
who know their self

13:30.076 --> 13:33.564
cannot fight with each other.

13:34.725 --> 13:42.725
Because this Self is the reflection of one
person,

13:42.926 --> 13:50.960
of one Deity, of one God. And so how can
you fight?

13:51.161 --> 13:58.725
When He is within your heart, how can you
fight with each other?

13:58.926 --> 14:02.703
When He, otherwise you’ll be fighting
with yourself.

14:02.904 --> 14:07.297
It would be very, very stupid to do that.

14:07.498 --> 14:15.756
So all the fights and all the funny things
that you have been thinking about

14:16.256 --> 14:21.842
will of course disappear, no doubt. But
you’ll become very dynamic.

14:22.043 --> 14:26.280
You’ll be amazed at your dynamism. Just you
have to rise;

14:26.481 --> 14:32.350
just you have to expect your Self
to manifest.

14:32.551 --> 14:39.149
You can become very, very collective,
progressive

14:39.350 --> 14:43.779
and you can create many Sahaja Yogis.

14:43.980 --> 14:52.641
You have been given Realization; you have
been given the knowledge of Realization;

14:52.842 --> 15:00.586
whatever was possible has been done
for your health and prosperity,

15:00.787 --> 15:10.178
but now it’s your duty to repay to
the Divine by your creative methods.

15:10.379 --> 15:13.764
You have to be very creative.

15:13.965 --> 15:22.031
You'll find so many people in this world
are full of lots of problems,

15:22.232 --> 15:28.663
which you have got out of it. But you can
help them.

15:28.864 --> 15:33.662
You don’t need any help because you are
yourself full of power –

15:33.863 --> 15:40.790
power of Divinity within you. This Divine
power should be used.

15:40.991 --> 15:46.704
It’s not given just to be rusted. This
power has to be used.

15:46.904 --> 15:50.955
Otherwise what’s the use of becoming
powerful?

15:51.156 --> 15:55.987
Supposing we have electrical power here,
and it doesn’t even give light,

15:56.188 --> 15:59.807
so what’s the use of having electrical
power?

16:00.008 --> 16:05.900
So the power that you have is for
the emancipation of human beings.

16:08.357 --> 16:16.104
It is for you to raise the Kundalini
of people – you can do it.

16:16.305 --> 16:19.291
One person can do it for thousands!

16:19.492 --> 16:25.792
And I hope now you take up this
responsibility upon yourself.

16:25.993 --> 16:31.848
This would be the greatest blessing for
you, for Sahaja Yoga

16:32.049 --> 16:39.801
and for the whole world. Because in My
vision, we have to change the whole world.

16:40.002 --> 16:43.746
I don’t know in My lifetime if I can
achieve it or not.

16:43.947 --> 16:47.534
But if you people really join hands with Me,

16:47.735 --> 16:53.348
with full effort, it will work out.

16:53.549 --> 17:02.840
Firstly I hear many people don’t go
to meditation, into collective meditation.

17:03.041 --> 17:10.770
They do not join together. It’s surprising
after so many years of work I’ve done –

17:10.971 --> 17:16.528
thirty years I’ve been working, and there
are some, some people

17:16.729 --> 17:23.487
who take Sahaja Yoga for granted. You don’t
understand your responsibility.

17:23.688 --> 17:27.965
You have to meditate collectively.

17:28.166 --> 17:33.088
Whenever there is collective meditation
you must join that.

17:33.289 --> 17:41.502
You can also start something in your areas,
a collective meditation.

17:41.703 --> 17:47.752
And it will work out. Many people who are
in Sahaja Yoga

17:47.953 --> 17:51.588
are now meditating, I can make them out.

17:51.789 --> 17:55.987
I know who are the ones who are meditating
and who are not.

17:56.188 --> 17:59.848
It’s not difficult to make it out. And then
you come out

18:00.049 --> 18:05.403
with other problems like my mother’s,
father’s, uncle’s – this thing.

18:05.604 --> 18:11.590
There’s no need to worry about that. Even
if you are a realized soul,

18:11.791 --> 18:18.807
and when you are connected with the Divine,
even your own wish will be fulfilled.

18:19.008 --> 18:27.090
But it does not. Why? Because you still do
not understand what you have become.

18:27.291 --> 18:33.635
You first try giving Realizations to others.
See what joy you feel.

18:33.836 --> 18:39.106
Tremendous joy. This joy you cannot get
in anything else.

18:39.307 --> 18:43.994
Whatever you may buy, whatever you may
have,

18:44.195 --> 18:48.574
you cannot get this joy of giving
Realization.

18:48.775 --> 18:54.246
And you will be so very happy; not because
you expect anything,

18:54.447 --> 19:01.051
you want anything, nothing of the kind –
but only thing is pure joy –

19:01.252 --> 19:08.823
pure joy of creating great Sahaja Yogis.
This is what you are there.

19:09.024 --> 19:18.028
This is what the Divine wants you to do.
Not just to take advantage of Divine power:

19:18.229 --> 19:23.090
“Cure my father, cure my mother, cure
my sister… ”

19:23.291 --> 19:27.621
or else, “I haven’t got properties…” Then
somebody says,

19:27.822 --> 19:34.371
“My husband ill-treats me…” or some wife
says that… so the husband says this...

19:34.572 --> 19:37.792
It’s going on and on and on. Forget it!

19:37.993 --> 19:41.738
You are now above everything, above all
these things.

19:41.939 --> 19:47.168
And you have become absolutely powerful,
believe Me.

19:47.369 --> 19:52.776
If you haven’t used your power, then how
will you know what powers you have got?

19:52.977 --> 19:57.653
It’s as simple as that. Those who have
used it

19:57.854 --> 20:02.770
go on telling Me what miracles they had,
what things have happened to them,

20:02.971 --> 20:08.838
how they were protected, whatever they
wanted – how they got it.

20:09.229 --> 20:15.934
But see, in Sahaja Yoga you cannot be
hypocritical. If you have hypocrisy,

20:16.135 --> 20:19.323
Sahaja Yoga knows, the Divine knows
you are a hypocritical.

20:19.524 --> 20:24.715
It is for your good, for your growth you
have to be in Sahaja Yoga.

20:24.916 --> 20:29.090
It’s not for somebody else that you are
doing it, but for yourself.

20:29.291 --> 20:36.567
When people are that powerful I am
amazed, how they easily they can get cured.

20:36.768 --> 20:41.620
But they must meditate, and they must join
collective meditation.

20:41.821 --> 20:46.299
Most of the people don’t join collective
meditation. I am surprised.

20:46.500 --> 20:51.688
I know, sometimes, say in Delhi, there is
no sufficient space,

20:51.889 --> 20:56.736
so people have to come twice, either
Saturday or Sunday;

20:56.937 --> 21:00.138
some of them have to wait outside –
doesn’t matter.

21:01.156 --> 21:04.502
But going for the collective meditation,

21:04.703 --> 21:10.900
you’ll be amazed that Divinity is flowing
there. Vibrations are flowing there.

21:11.101 --> 21:18.469
I am there. It’s not that you are just
going there just as a ritual.

21:18.703 --> 21:26.664
Problem is you people don’t realize that you
have to be responsible for Sahaja Yoga,

21:26.865 --> 21:33.877
responsible for giving Realizations
to others and attend

21:34.078 --> 21:41.227
all the programs you have of meditation.

21:41.428 --> 21:45.768
With collective meditation you get
all right.

21:45.969 --> 21:52.342
All your problems are solved if you go to
the collective meditation regularly –

21:52.543 --> 21:58.979
I promise you! But the problem is you won’t
go; you will write letters to Me,

21:59.180 --> 22:04.313
you want to meet Me. This is not going
to help.

22:04.514 --> 22:09.557
You may come and trouble Me like that, or
do something like that, but doesn’t help.

22:09.758 --> 22:19.500
What helps that you help yourself. Next
year is going to be a great year for you.

22:20.555 --> 22:26.562
In the West now I was surprised how things
are spreading fast.

22:26.844 --> 22:36.188
In Russia the people are so deep – so deep.

22:36.389 --> 22:43.532
Once they get Realization, they understand
the value of Realization.

22:43.733 --> 22:49.314
They are so humble, and so deep, they don’t
want anything.

22:49.515 --> 22:54.861
They’ve never desired for anything. Though
they have gone through horrible

22:55.062 --> 23:02.110
problems of communism, and now this
reaction to that.

23:02.311 --> 23:11.197
Despite that, all these five countries
which I call as ‘real’

23:11.398 --> 23:18.484
Divine countries, because the way they have
accepted it.

23:19.094 --> 23:22.836
They are poor according to the modern
standards,

23:23.037 --> 23:27.812
but from their heart they are very,
very rich.

23:28.086 --> 23:34.328
From their understanding of Sahaja Yoga,
they are very, very rich.

23:34.529 --> 23:40.860
And their scientists are so well qualified.
In every type of thing now,

23:41.061 --> 23:48.314
there is one scientist who has come
to India and who has discovered a method

23:48.515 --> 23:53.658
by which you can see all the chakras, and
the Kundalini

23:53.859 --> 23:59.744
and the obstructions and everything –
something he can show you.

23:59.945 --> 24:07.760
While our scientists are busy opposing Me.
Little knowledge is very dangerous.

24:07.961 --> 24:11.688
They don’t want to see what I am doing and
how I am doing it.

24:11.889 --> 24:17.986
They just want to criticize Me – all
so-called intellectuals.

24:18.187 --> 24:20.360
Especially in Maharashtra,

24:20.561 --> 24:24.822
the intellectuals – I think they are
something has gone wrong with their heads.

24:25.023 --> 24:30.643
They cannot understand Sahaja Yoga. Just
beyond them.

24:30.844 --> 24:37.041
What has happened to them I don’t know,
but they just can’t understand Sahaja Yoga.

24:37.242 --> 24:42.643
And these Maharashtrians are so busy with
their rituals.

24:42.844 --> 24:46.649
Four o’clock in the morning they’ll get up,
take their baths, do this,

24:46.850 --> 24:51.768
then start doing their Pujas, this, that.

24:51.969 --> 24:56.407
Now somebody got sick, so his wife writes
to Me,

24:56.608 --> 24:59.969
“We didn’t go to any temple, we didn’t do
any rituals,

25:00.170 --> 25:03.204
still my husband has got sick.” Imagine.

25:03.405 --> 25:07.955
As if doing by that you mean you are
a Sahaja Yogi.

25:08.156 --> 25:12.486
If you are a real Sahaja Yogi, then nothing
can happen to you.

25:12.687 --> 25:16.580
But you have been just under wrong
impression.

25:16.781 --> 25:22.011
Whether you go to temple, or whether you go
to wrong places

25:22.212 --> 25:29.355
and do all kinds of rituals – it has never
helped anyone.

25:29.556 --> 25:35.964
So first you have to empty yourself. If you
are already filled with these ideas,

25:36.165 --> 25:41.501
these age old ideas, and you are still
carrying on with them,

25:41.702 --> 25:43.886
how can the Divine be filled?

25:44.087 --> 25:50.355
If there’s a pot already full of water or
anything – you cannot fill it.

25:50.556 --> 25:58.306
So you have to empty it completely. Empty
yourself, empty your mind.

25:58.507 --> 26:06.894
It’s possible through Sahaja Yoga if you can
take your Kundalini beyond Agnya chakra.

26:07.095 --> 26:12.480
By not reacting! Reaction is the worst
thing,

26:12.681 --> 26:18.503
because reaction comes through your Agnya,
as I told you the other day,

26:18.704 --> 26:27.298
and it is due to your conditioning or due
to your ego.

26:27.499 --> 26:32.355
So some people react because of their
conditioning,

26:32.556 --> 26:41.683
and some people react because of their ego.
So why should you react to anything?

26:41.884 --> 26:46.589
Why don’t you enjoy – by not reacting.
You just watch.

26:46.790 --> 26:53.823
See how beautifully they have made
beautiful flowers – just enjoy it.

26:54.024 --> 26:58.284
What is the need – some will find some
faults, somebody will say

26:58.485 --> 27:01.423
this should not have been there, how did
they manage this,

27:01.624 --> 27:09.026
all kinds of nonsensical things. The joy
of its creation is there.

27:09.227 --> 27:14.612
And you should be able to see it, feel it,
enjoy it.

27:14.813 --> 27:19.891
Then you are a Sahaja Yogi. Otherwise
you are not.

27:20.092 --> 27:25.986
If you are a reacting type, you cannot be
a Sahaja Yogi.

27:26.187 --> 27:30.494
This is a degree – Sahaja Yoga is –

27:30.695 --> 27:36.782
I think there are so many various styles
of Sahaja Yogis.

27:37.110 --> 27:44.097
Somebody is just minor, somebody a little
plus, somebody’s like that.

27:44.298 --> 27:50.009
But the depth of the Sahaja Yogi is

27:50.210 --> 27:55.894
to be measured by the way he keeps joyous
and happy.

27:56.095 --> 28:01.097
Goes on criticizing others, go on getting
angry with others,

28:01.298 --> 28:06.149
all these things are going on, and he
thinks he’s a Sahaja Yogi.

28:06.360 --> 28:13.940
In our Divine University we have no
degrees, we don’t give you certificates,

28:14.142 --> 28:17.065
you are a Sahaja Yogi, if you have got
your Realization.

28:17.266 --> 28:23.032
If the Kundalini has burst opened here –
it’s all right, you are a Sahaja Yogi.

28:23.233 --> 28:29.765
But that Sahaja Yogi may not be a real
Sahaja Yogi.

28:29.966 --> 28:36.563
It only depends when you are joyous and you
are anxious

28:36.764 --> 28:42.392
to give Realizations to others. You want
to share your Realization,

28:42.593 --> 28:49.063
you just don’t want to keep it to yourself.
If that is not your condition,

28:49.264 --> 28:53.249
then you are still not a full Sahaja Yogi.

28:53.450 --> 28:57.475
You should find out how many people you
have given Realization.

28:57.676 --> 29:03.704
It’s very important. Because next year, as
I’ve said, is a very important,

29:03.905 --> 29:09.234
very, very important year.

29:09.435 --> 29:19.728
In that year I would like to see all of you
going round and giving Realization.

29:19.929 --> 29:26.925
While I’ve seen all these other false gurus
who are getting exposed one by one.

29:27.785 --> 29:35.837
If you see their attitude, anywhere you
meet them – once I was travelling

29:36.038 --> 29:40.272
by plane and there was a lady sitting next
to Me, she was so hot.

29:40.473 --> 29:44.649
So I asked her, “What guru do you follow?”
So she told Me the name.

29:44.850 --> 29:49.429
She said “He’s very good, this guru is
the best” … this and that.

29:49.630 --> 29:53.993
Such heat coming from her body! I never
said anything,

29:54.194 --> 30:00.837
but I was amazed how this lady was proudly
talking about her guru

30:01.038 --> 30:08.845
who is such a bad man – and without knowing
Me, I was just a stranger to her.

30:09.046 --> 30:13.038
But Sahaja Yogis don’t talk about it.

30:13.239 --> 30:19.272
You should talk to your neighbors, you
should talk in your circle.

30:21.717 --> 30:28.696
Like, we have in India so many customs when
we meet people:

30:28.897 --> 30:32.882
Like in India we do haldi kumkum
in Maharashtra.

30:33.083 --> 30:37.883
They will never talk to those women who
come for haldi kumkum about Sahaja Yoga.

30:38.084 --> 30:41.780
They won’t even have My photograph.

30:42.342 --> 30:45.163
If they want, they can do it. But they
are -

30:45.364 --> 30:50.039
I don’t know what are they frightened
about. It’s a very good chance.

30:50.223 --> 30:56.321
You have any dinner, you have any public
meeting, anything.

30:56.522 --> 31:00.624
They won’t talk about Sahaja Yoga.
It’s very surprising.

31:00.825 --> 31:02.764
They don’t want to talk about Sahaja Yoga

31:02.965 --> 31:07.219
that, “We have got this through Sahaja
Yoga.”

31:07.420 --> 31:10.946
So how will Sahaja Yoga spread?

31:11.147 --> 31:18.360
One has to understand you all should find
out how much responsible you have been

31:18.561 --> 31:23.532
for getting into Sahaja Yoga. Of course,
you are all protected,

31:23.733 --> 31:33.289
you are all blessed, everyone has got
whatever they wanted. Most of them.

31:33.490 --> 31:39.835
But how many of them are returning
this debt?

31:40.036 --> 31:45.539
How many are working to give Realization
to others?

31:45.740 --> 31:55.196
This is a debt on you. But if your
attention is haphazard,

31:55.397 --> 32:04.061
if your attention is not clear, is not
nirmal,

32:04.262 --> 32:14.516
then you are involved into all kinds
of things like the tentacles of an octopus.

32:14.717 --> 32:17.249
You become like an octopus,

32:17.450 --> 32:22.313
you go on getting attached to this,
attached to that, attached to that.

32:22.514 --> 32:30.764
You have to be a free bird. All these
attachments that you have

32:32.084 --> 32:39.454
are going to take you nowhere. You should
be only attached to Sahaja Yoga

32:39.655 --> 32:45.202
and should be conscious that you have known
yourself.

32:45.403 --> 32:52.149
If you can just understand your value,
your level,

32:52.350 --> 32:57.514
I can tell you – we can change the whole
world!

32:57.715 --> 33:01.286
We have such a good heritage in this
country;

33:01.478 --> 33:05.194
we have such good culture in this country.

33:05.395 --> 33:11.373
I have seen the problems of America and
other places, we don’t have these problems.

33:11.574 --> 33:16.551
At least they’re not so prevalent.

33:16.752 --> 33:21.669
But only the thing that we have to do

33:22.324 --> 33:26.264
is to know you are a Sahaja Yogi.

33:26.465 --> 33:32.045
Like a tree – when it grows, it knows
it’s a tree.

33:32.246 --> 33:38.256
It knows it has to produce roots, it has
not come up ‘like that’.

33:38.457 --> 33:45.069
It has not been brought up just like
a stick, no.

33:45.270 --> 33:52.545
It has to do something. In this world
everything has to do something.

33:52.746 --> 33:57.239
But then what about Sahaja Yogis? It’s such
a rare thing to happen

33:57.440 --> 34:02.748
that you have got your Realization. So
where should we waste our attention?

34:02.949 --> 34:10.014
Why should we neglect our meditation? Why?
We have to grow, we are a different people.

34:10.215 --> 34:16.075
We are a different race altogether in this
world. We are realized souls.

34:16.276 --> 34:22.615
There were hardly any number during
the time of Christ, practically nil.

34:22.816 --> 34:28.895
And even before that I was surprised that
in China and other places,

34:29.096 --> 34:36.879
in one age there used to be one guru – one
master. While you are so many masters,

34:37.080 --> 34:41.825
but you don’t want to use your power
as a master.

34:42.026 --> 34:46.850
Why not the women use it also? I find women
are more lethargic

34:47.051 --> 34:51.691
than men are in Sahaja Yoga. They should
show – I am a woman Myself,

34:51.892 --> 34:56.106
single-handed I’ve done all this work;
and why shouldn’t you do it?

34:56.307 --> 35:02.319
Because it’s a tremendous task to transform
people all over the world.

35:02.520 --> 35:08.959
But it’s very easy for you – if I can
do it, why can’t you do it?

35:09.160 --> 35:17.686
But put your complete attention to it that:
‘We are going to work out Sahaja Yoga,

35:17.887 --> 35:21.967
not for ourselves, but for the betterment
of humanity.’

35:22.168 --> 35:27.044
We need it, we need it very much.

35:27.245 --> 35:33.537
Your compassion, your love, is all being
wasted

35:33.738 --> 35:39.606
if you just think about yourself,
your family – what’s the use?

35:40.088 --> 35:43.686
People do that even before Realization.

35:43.887 --> 35:50.403
So what is the use of completely getting
attached to your families,

35:50.604 --> 35:56.458
attached to all other things? You should
get attached to the whole world!

35:56.659 --> 36:02.239
You belong to the whole world now, you are
no more individualistic.

36:02.440 --> 36:08.780
No more! Now, as I said, it’s a drop
has become the ocean.

36:08.981 --> 36:16.256
Identify yourself with the ocean. Ocean is
the lowest, if you have seen,

36:16.457 --> 36:22.356
lowest so much that the zero point starts
from the ocean.

36:22.557 --> 36:28.756
Ocean is so humble. It’s the lowest point –
it lives,

36:28.957 --> 36:32.606
but all the rivers flow into it.

36:32.807 --> 36:39.850
And the ocean does the work of throwing
clouds in the sky.

36:40.051 --> 36:48.098
And these then burst and become rain
falling to the same ocean.

36:48.299 --> 36:54.463
They come back to the same ocean. So those
who are humble

36:54.664 --> 36:58.293
will attract more Sahaja Yogis.

36:58.494 --> 37:03.309
Those who are kind will attract much more
Sahaja Yogis.

37:03.510 --> 37:08.660
So it is important to see that you change
your temperament.

37:08.861 --> 37:14.651
If you try to show off, nobody is going
to be impressed by you.

37:16.682 --> 37:23.746
If you think you are something very great,
nobody is going to look at you.

37:23.947 --> 37:33.691
Be very humble, kind, generous – also very
joyous person.

37:33.892 --> 37:38.323
Now imagine a Sahaja Yogi going in a group
and telling them,

37:38.524 --> 37:45.237
“See, my mother is sick, my father is dying
and this thing is happening,

37:45.438 --> 37:53.223
but I am doing Sahaja Yoga.” So people will
say, “Why do you do Sahaja Yoga then?

37:53.424 --> 37:57.465
You go and cry and weep and sit down
there!”

37:57.666 --> 38:05.512
If he’s really doing the Sahaja Yoga, no
sickness can come, no trouble can come.

38:05.713 --> 38:10.971
It is a fact. Try to understand.

38:11.172 --> 38:17.973
With you only these people who are
supposed to be there, they will rise.

38:18.174 --> 38:24.284
But no use having identification with
people who are not Sahaja Yogis.

38:24.485 --> 38:27.846
They may be your relations, they may be
anything. No use,

38:28.047 --> 38:31.643
because you are at a different level, they
are at a different level.

38:31.844 --> 38:37.160
Either try to raise their level, or have
nothing to do with them,

38:37.361 --> 38:42.816
because they will pull you down. They will
not see your height,

38:43.017 --> 38:49.151
they have no eyes to see, they have no ear
to hear,

38:49.352 --> 38:55.816
and they have no feelings of any kind.
If they have seen how you are changed,

38:56.017 --> 39:03.550
how your life is changed, they would have
gone absolutely head-long into Sahaja Yoga.

39:03.751 --> 39:09.395
But if they are not, that’s not your job.
You shouldn’t bother about them.

39:09.596 --> 39:13.965
If they come to Sahaja Yoga, well and good,
otherwise they are no your relations.

39:14.166 --> 39:18.814
In no way they are related to you. How will
you relate Sahaja Yoga to them?

39:19.015 --> 39:22.995
How will you explain anything to them?
It’s going to be impossible

39:23.196 --> 39:26.033
to talk to these people.

39:28.064 --> 39:32.926
So what I have to tell you today is that
our family which is Sahaja Yoga,

39:33.127 --> 39:40.035
is large, it’s spread in 86 countries, and
it’s doing very well.

39:40.236 --> 39:44.909
But what we have to see – that you do
belong to that ocean,

39:45.110 --> 39:49.254
to the great families of Sahaja Yoga.

39:49.455 --> 39:55.533
But it is for you to increase the size
of this.

39:55.744 --> 40:01.512
You have to increase, you have to talk
about it, and you have to change people.

40:01.713 --> 40:10.816
This is your responsibility. You were not
given Sahaja Yoga just for nothing,

40:11.017 --> 40:17.207
you have to produce greater Sahaja Yogis,
better Sahaja Yogis;

40:17.408 --> 40:22.393
and you yourself meditate, not only
meditate

40:22.594 --> 40:28.473
but also attend all the collective programs
as far as possible.

40:28.674 --> 40:33.955
I am happy the way you have stayed on and
have come here.

40:34.156 --> 40:42.941
It has rained – still you are here and you
still are enjoying the Divine bliss.

40:43.142 --> 40:49.018
I again and again bless you from my heart,
and I want you to have

40:49.219 --> 40:54.332
that Shuddha Iccha which is the Kundalini,

40:54.533 --> 41:02.574
want you to have that Shuddha Iccha that is
the pure desire,

41:02.775 --> 41:08.926
not only to become Sahaja Yogis but
to create more Sahaja Yogis.

41:09.127 --> 41:15.025
That is actually your pure desire. You may
not have recognized it,

41:15.226 --> 41:21.035
but unless and until you fulfill that
desire,

41:21.236 --> 41:25.822
you can never be a good Sahaja Yogi.
It’s to spread Sahaja Yoga

41:26.023 --> 41:33.713
in every level, in everywhere, with every
one – that you can do it.

41:33.914 --> 41:39.223
And it will spread very well, and so many
people can be saved.

41:39.424 --> 41:45.582
So many people who are just lost
in the maya of stupidity

41:45.783 --> 41:48.682
will be back on the right path.

41:48.883 --> 41:53.457
How much good you are going to do for them
you just think.

41:53.658 --> 41:57.939
If Me alone has brought so many Sahaja
Yogis,

41:58.142 --> 42:05.410
why can’t you also try and get more Sahaja
Yogis? This world needs Sahaja Yoga.

42:05.611 --> 42:09.301
The whole problem – whenever I see
newspaper, I think, ‘Oh God,

42:09.502 --> 42:13.457
if these people were Sahaja Yogis, there
would have been no problem’.

42:13.658 --> 42:19.455
But I find that still people are roaming
about, and going round and round,

42:19.656 --> 42:25.260
I don’t know, as if they have no brains or
they’ve no understanding

42:25.468 --> 42:31.540
that ‘where is this world going?’ and
‘Who’s going to save this world?’

42:32.424 --> 42:38.549
I am not here to tell you what you should
do in your private life.

42:38.750 --> 42:42.867
But you yourself should know to keep
yourself cleansed

42:43.068 --> 42:46.586
and beautiful, what you have to do
to yourself.

42:46.787 --> 42:51.244
Some people are so superficial that it
doesn’t go into their heads.

42:51.445 --> 42:54.838
Sahaja Yoga just doesn’t go into their
heads – very, very superficial.

42:55.039 --> 43:00.150
So forget them. I don’t think they can
be saved. So forget them,

43:00.351 --> 43:04.723
they cannot enjoy. They are worried about
some nonsensical things always.

43:04.924 --> 43:09.908
So with such people you need not – but
there are still so many people,

43:10.109 --> 43:17.308
at least I think 80% people, who are
seeking and you should give them help.

43:17.509 --> 43:20.919
This is one thing, is the desire of your
Mother

43:21.120 --> 43:24.866
that you should now take up Sahaja Yoga
upon yourself

43:25.067 --> 43:28.950
and go on telling about this to everyone
who comes.

43:29.151 --> 43:38.111
I mean I don’t want cheap popularity, but I
do want Sahaja Yogis to be made everywhere.
