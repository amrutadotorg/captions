00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:14.303
All the clashes, all the problems of human
beings are because they are not what they talk,

00:00:14.819 --> 00:00:21.205
ideals are out, out of their life.

00:00:25.719 --> 00:00:33.065
That is how a Sahaja Yogi will show himself
off compared to anybody else.

00:00:33.145 --> 00:00:37.319
Take an example say of Abraham Lincoln, all
right?

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:41.513
Abraham Lincoln believed that everybody must
have freedom

00:00:41.593 --> 00:00:46.245
and the government should be for the public, for the people.

00:00:46.325 --> 00:00:51.219
Whatever He talked He practised it.

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:54.670
Whatever He believed in He worked it out

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:01.533
and gave His life for it,
that’s why He’s a great man.

00:01:01.613 --> 00:01:07.820
Think of Mahatma Gandhi, they
were not like Christ – incarnations.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:15.518
Think of any great man, think of Shivaji Maharaj,
any one of the saints – they were human beings.

00:01:15.598 --> 00:01:21.216
But once they knew this is the
principle on which we have to live,

00:01:21.296 --> 00:01:26.874
they become one with the principles, they do not compromise.

00:01:29.428 --> 00:01:36.679
So what Sahaja Yogi has to be that we should understand.

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:43.843
A Sahaja Yogi is a person who has got Realization
through the Kundalini,

00:01:43.923 --> 00:01:52.999
and Kundalini is the motherhood in you,
is the caring, nourishing power within you.

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:56.281
But mother will never compromise with the son;

00:01:56.361 --> 00:02:00.089
if he wants to kill somebody she’ll say: "No".
I mean a real mother.

00:02:00.169 --> 00:02:06.073
She will even shoot that son who tries to do wrong things.

00:02:08.847 --> 00:02:16.218
In the same way if you become the mother of
yourself, then you have to look after yourself,

00:02:16.298 --> 00:02:22.162
in the same manner that you nourish yourself
and all others also,

00:02:22.242 --> 00:02:24.635
you have to nourish them, care for them,

00:02:24.715 --> 00:02:31.729
and do not compromise with wrong
doings, unrighteousness things, absurd things.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:39.928
Now when I tell you this it is not
necessary for you to feel guilty.

00:02:43.554 --> 00:02:46.628
We have to look upward.

00:02:46.708 --> 00:02:57.729
Those who are standing even on a lower staircase,
 if they are looking upward they are all right,

00:02:57.809 --> 00:03:08.419
but those who are standing at a higher steps,
and looking downward, will go down.

00:03:08.499 --> 00:03:10.928
So look forward.

00:03:11.008 --> 00:03:18.453
What we have to do in our day-to-day life
in simple relationships even husband, wife,

00:03:18.533 --> 00:03:23.682
children, parents – are you becoming silent
within yourself?

00:03:23.762 --> 00:03:31.169
Are you nourishing it, with your silence,
with your compassion,

00:03:31.249 --> 00:03:37.189
or you are supporting something that is absolutely anti-God?

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:45.022
If you become the ideals, the power of ideals
itself, will make you so dynamic

00:03:45.102 --> 00:03:52.029
that you don’t need to consult
anybody, you become the ideal.

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.879
They are like torches.

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:02.449
Your ideals itself will be enlightened.

00:04:02.529 --> 00:04:06.719
So the first attitude should be:
“How do we deepen ourselves?”

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:08.640
That should be first attitude.

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:14.760
So in your meditations you have to sit down.

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.669
Now what do you say in meditation?

00:04:18.749 --> 00:04:21.440
Try to see all the chakras.

00:04:22.974 --> 00:04:25.970
What chakras are catching, face it yourself.

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.740
These might be from your past life.

00:04:30.459 --> 00:04:33.550
Some chakras are weak.

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:39.480
Try to make them all right, try to strengthen
them.

00:04:40.952 --> 00:04:45.595
Because ideals have to be worked out the instrument
has to be all right.

00:04:45.675 --> 00:04:53.158
If the instrument is a crazy one how will you do?

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:00.413
So first of all you must develop your instrument
properly, it should be balanced,

00:05:00.493 --> 00:05:03.610
powerful, not cowardly.

00:05:05.521 --> 00:05:09.601
People should feel your power.

00:05:09.681 --> 00:05:11.756
Of course the power is of love,

00:05:11.836 --> 00:05:17.166
but love doesn’t
mean that you compromise with all the nonsensical things.

00:05:17.246 --> 00:05:20.560
There should be no compromise at all.

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:32.950
It’s a very self-certifying state.

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:37.795
We cannot say when it is so, we just cannot say.

00:05:37.875 --> 00:05:43.971
Itself the state will certify that I’m all
right now, I have reached that state.

00:05:44.051 --> 00:05:52.760
We cannot say after five hours, three
minutes, two seconds you’ll become that.

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:58.362
You just mature and you see that maturity within you.

00:06:02.009 --> 00:06:06.407
Once you understand that unless and until you
become your ideals

00:06:06.487 --> 00:06:08.672
you are not a Sahaja Yogi.

00:06:08.752 --> 00:06:12.228
Everybody can call themselves Sahaja Yogis,
there’s not inauguration,

00:06:12.308 --> 00:06:19.970
we don’t have any sort of a – inauguration of a
university

00:06:22.251 --> 00:06:26.130
where people can come and get their degrees

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:31.394
and diplomas: “All right you are certified twice born".

00:06:31.474 --> 00:06:36.540
There are some who are several times twice born.

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:40.561
They are twice born today, tomorrow they are not,
then again they come twice born

00:06:40.641 --> 00:06:42.714
and again twice born.

00:06:42.794 --> 00:06:48.307
Some of them can be one hundred and eight
times twice born in Sahaja Yoga.

00:06:48.387 --> 00:06:52.330
And even then they are not certified.

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:56.006
So you have to give yourself a certificate.

00:06:56.086 --> 00:06:58.777
There’s no university to do that.

00:07:01.315 --> 00:07:05.985
You have to understand yourself, what are
your problems, why you are behaving like this?

00:07:06.065 --> 00:07:09.767
You treat yourself as a child.

00:07:09.847 --> 00:07:13.629
When it is needed you have to rebuke yourself.

00:07:13.709 --> 00:07:16.130
When you have to glorify, you should glorify yourself.

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:19.050
So now you separate.

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:22.314
You become the mother, the Spirit is the mother,

00:07:22.394 --> 00:07:26.920
and you, whatever you are which has to grow, is the child.

00:07:28.698 --> 00:07:38.570
Mother is the ideal, she is the inspiration,
she is the power, and the child is the recipient.

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:43.470
If the child is an obstinate fellow then you
can’t do anything about it.

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:47.768
Also find out – you might be one of them.
I know who are they like that.

00:07:47.848 --> 00:07:54.264
There are many and you can find them out in no time.

00:07:54.344 --> 00:08:04.519
Obstinate fellows, if they live with ten people
suddenly we hear reports of their existence.

00:08:04.599 --> 00:08:09.982
They are quite eloquent even if they are not
talking a word people can tell you:

00:08:10.062 --> 00:08:14.530
“I had a fight with such and such.

00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:19.848
That person said such and such a thing to
me, that person was so cruel to me,

00:08:19.928 --> 00:08:21.960
that person demanded this.

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:24.550
You know which person it is, where.

00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:28.399
You see as a diamond can be made
out, thorns can be made out also.

00:08:28.479 --> 00:08:35.036
Anytime you go near the thorn, anyone
without exception, it will bite everyone.

00:08:35.116 --> 00:08:37.380
It is not going to spare, it’s a thorn.

00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:40.800
So a thorn has to be a thorn.

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:48.642
But if you are a Sahaja Yogi you have to be
a flower and a strong flower

00:08:48.722 --> 00:08:55.030
and an eternal flower, that always grows, does not fade out.

00:08:55.659 --> 00:09:01.002
Always growing, never fades, such a flower
you have to be,

00:09:01.082 --> 00:09:09.371
then you will be surprised that
you do not get into a trip of ego,

00:09:09.451 --> 00:09:22.033
neither you go into a complete collapse of super-ego.

00:09:22.113 --> 00:09:28.743
So much you know that any one of you
can be called as a scholar I can tell you.

00:09:28.823 --> 00:09:32.399
I mean so many times people have asked Me:

00:09:32.479 --> 00:09:36.658
“Are they all scholars that You have – Your Disciples?”

00:09:36.738 --> 00:09:45.469
You know so much, much more than
any Saint ever knew. I can assure you.

00:09:45.549 --> 00:09:49.119
But you know only in the brain, outside.

00:09:49.199 --> 00:09:52.980
It’s all bla bla bla.

00:09:53.769 --> 00:09:59.918
It comes to the brain, you use it to show
off to others, and finished.

00:09:59.998 --> 00:10:06.160
It doesn’t even settle down there,
then how will it go to the heart?

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:10.423
So everybody is talking big, they can impress people.

00:10:10.503 --> 00:10:16.322
I mean if some journalists come here they’ll
be so impressed by the Sahaja Yogis,

00:10:16.402 --> 00:10:23.619
so many wise men in England sitting down here.

00:10:23.699 --> 00:10:28.141
But you laugh at yourself.

00:10:28.221 --> 00:10:35.324
You have known all this because I’ve been speaking too much.

00:10:38.431 --> 00:10:43.274
Also the Spirit is shining.

00:10:43.354 --> 00:10:46.841
Let your Spirit shine in such a way

00:10:46.921 --> 00:10:51.922
that people know this is a man who is completely integrated:

00:10:52.002 --> 00:10:59.715
the Spirit, the talk, the behavior,
the life itself is completely integrated

00:10:59.795 --> 00:11:03.108
and this is what is Sahastrara.

00:11:03.188 --> 00:11:09.560
So if there is no integration you
have not achieved your Sahastrara.

00:11:12.959 --> 00:11:17.020
There will be no need to pull your ears.

00:11:18.322 --> 00:11:28.220
A day should come when you all will raise
your heads with great pride and glory

00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:34.140
because your ideals will shine like ornaments.

00:11:34.822 --> 00:11:40.767
I want to see those days when all those who
claim to be Sahaja Yogis become that.

00:11:40.847 --> 00:11:44.560
That’s the most important
thing, all other things are useless.

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:51.500
Getting an ashram, getting this,
doing this, doing that – forget it.

00:11:57.166 --> 00:12:01.694
What you have to manage is this child which has to
grow,

00:12:01.774 --> 00:12:05.157
who is still naughty sometimes, tries to misbehave.

00:12:05.237 --> 00:12:08.308
Now put it right.
You give it a name.

00:12:08.388 --> 00:12:15.374
You call yourself a Sahaja
Yogi and that child as Mr. X, Mr. Y

00:12:15.454 --> 00:12:21.280
whatever your name has been and always try
to tell: “Now will you behave yourself".

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:27.309
"Get up in the morning, have
your bath, sit down for meditation."

00:12:27.841 --> 00:12:30.470
“I feel lazy,” the child says, “I can’t."

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:38.497
Then you accept the child, then the child will become
the mother and you will be losing your powers.

00:12:38.577 --> 00:12:40.577
Excuses!

00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:46.197
The child knows, very intelligent, it’s
a very clever child,

00:12:46.277 --> 00:12:49.684
extremely intelligent, knows how to deceive you.

00:12:49.764 --> 00:12:57.006
But the child also knows innately what it needs.

00:12:57.086 --> 00:13:03.707
If it comes to know that the mother in you
has developed that personality,

00:13:03.787 --> 00:13:06.395
then it accepts mother’s personality.

00:13:06.475 --> 00:13:13.057
But if the child knows the mother herself is
weak then he starts taking advantage of the mother.

00:13:13.137 --> 00:13:24.597
So you have to not fight yourself but to tame.

00:13:24.677 --> 00:13:29.515
And this is very easy. You’ll
start enjoying it, looking at yourself:

00:13:29.595 --> 00:13:31.749
“Oh Mr. so and so."

00:13:31.829 --> 00:13:34.254
Then you won’t be angry.

00:13:34.334 --> 00:13:42.755
“I know how to handle you, you’re hiding
behind there, all right,  giving excuses.

00:13:46.562 --> 00:13:56.328
” And the child grows big, so big
that mother sees that and is amazed.

00:13:56.408 --> 00:14:00.909
Like in Shri Krishna’s childhood, the Mother was
Yeshoda

00:14:00.989 --> 00:14:04.417
and the child was Shri Krishna. It’s very symbolic.

00:14:04.497 --> 00:14:10.212
And He used to play very naughty tricks

00:14:10.292 --> 00:14:15.800
and She said: “You went and ate that
mud from there. I know you have eaten.

00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:21.230
” He said: “How can I eat, how can
I, I can’t even go out of the house.

00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:23.297
I’m sitting down here.

00:14:23.377 --> 00:14:27.457
Where is the mud?
How can I eat?”

00:14:27.537 --> 00:14:34.169
“You did eat, I know you have eaten, so
better show me your mouth.”

00:14:34.249 --> 00:14:42.194
He says: “Really?” and then the mouth
opens and the complete Vishwa Swarup,

00:14:42.274 --> 00:14:50.770
complete vision of the whole Vishwa
She sees and the Mother falls at His Feet.

00:14:51.671 --> 00:14:54.410
That’s what it should be.

00:14:54.490 --> 00:15:00.299
This mother has to fall at the
feet of the child that has grown.

00:15:04.407 --> 00:15:06.209
Very symbolic.

00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:15.306
That is how you have to grow, into that Vishwa
Swarup.

00:15:15.386 --> 00:15:23.146
Into that Collective Being, into that Virata.

00:15:26.428 --> 00:15:30.873
Arjuna and Shri Krishna is another very good
symbolic thing.

00:15:30.953 --> 00:15:36.850
Arjuna was a friend who used to take liberties
with Shri Krishna.

00:15:39.924 --> 00:15:47.211
Shri Krishna tried to tell him about Gita,
all these things.

00:15:47.291 --> 00:15:52.384
But still Shri Krishna could not convince
him of that.

00:15:52.464 --> 00:15:57.087
All these were just outside “bla bla bla’s”;
as Mother’s talks are.

00:15:57.167 --> 00:16:02.859
Mother’s talks are very entertaining you
know very humorous, nice to hear them,

00:16:02.939 --> 00:16:07.230
instead of listening to any music better to hear Mother’s
talks.

00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:12.687
And then the people think if they are listening
to Mother they have become Mother already.

00:16:12.767 --> 00:16:24.397
That’s it happened to Arjuna also but still he
found out that there’s something lacking in him,

00:16:24.477 --> 00:16:31.789
that he has not become the ideal. Still his
attention is not there as it should have been.

00:16:31.869 --> 00:16:40.359
So he asked Shri Krishna: 
“I think I’ll see your great image.”

00:16:41.079 --> 00:16:45.310
Krishna said: “All right are you prepared?”
He said “Yes, I am prepared.”

00:16:45.390 --> 00:16:50.954
And then He became the Virata, the vision
of the Virata and when he saw it, he said:

00:16:51.034 --> 00:16:54.260
“Stop it, it is too much for me.”

00:16:55.126 --> 00:17:01.623
That’s what should happen to your friend
who is this child.

00:17:01.703 --> 00:17:05.382
That it should become that Virata and when
you see that,

00:17:05.462 --> 00:17:09.881
should be amazed at yourself:
“Oh God, I have grown like this.”

00:17:09.961 --> 00:17:14.016
Just like Yeshoda falling at the feet
of the little child,

00:17:14.096 --> 00:17:19.501
you have to fall at the feet
of the child that is within you.

00:17:20.554 --> 00:17:22.880
I am sure this will happen now.

00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:28.652
So remember that no argument, no explanation.

00:17:28.732 --> 00:17:33.470
Mother is forgiving. She’ll forgive
you everything, you know that.

00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:39.042
Anything you do I’ll forgive you, even if
you murder Me I’ll forgive you,

00:17:42.426 --> 00:17:45.949
but you won’t be able to forgive yourself.

00:17:48.072 --> 00:17:53.566
So allow that child to grow, grow fully.
