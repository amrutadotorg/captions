WEBVTT

00:18.960 --> 00:22.954
I bow to all the Seekers of Truth

00:24.888 --> 00:30.321
I'm very thankful to Mr Henry Tsang,

00:30.323 --> 00:35.542
for addressing you and introducing me to you,

00:35.564 --> 00:37.341
that’s very kind of him.

00:37.341 --> 00:46.024
It is the one the very rare occasions, where I have seen people in authority have understood my work

00:46.094 --> 00:47.625
and have tried to help me.

00:47.673 --> 00:51.978
Whatever he said is really very remarkable,

00:52.048 --> 01:01.387
that all these greater people like Lao-Tse, who started Taoism,

01:01.457 --> 01:05.349
Buddha, who was teaching Buddhism,

01:05.361 --> 01:15.551
all of them talked about the oneness of Human Being with the nature.

01:15.545 --> 01:19.521
And if you cannot combine nature with yourself,

01:19.533 --> 01:24.152
then you cannot be called as an evolved soul.

01:24.212 --> 01:34.521
In that thing I was telling him about Yangtze river where he comes from same state Yangtze.

01:34.563 --> 01:39.212
That Yangtze river I travelled through with my husband

01:39.271 --> 01:44.739
and it’s the one Lao-Tse has used

01:44.789 --> 01:47.819
for describing a human ascent.

01:47.840 --> 01:54.102
It’s a river which goes in different angles and makes lots of currents and it's very dangerous

01:54.194 --> 01:55.614
to ply through that,

01:55.664 --> 02:03.060
but they are having an... now a tourist arrangement to go through that

02:03.072 --> 02:07.462
and my husband as he was in the marine time, they invited us to see them.

02:07.471 --> 02:14.800
So in that the message was that, you see, you are passing through a very beautiful land.

02:14.853 --> 02:20.185
You see across the banks, beautiful trees

02:20.235 --> 02:25.735
and very beautiful mountains, which you see in the paintings of Chinese.

02:25.805 --> 02:27.625
They are really like that,

02:27.795 --> 02:30.045
but you should not get lost.

02:30.103 --> 02:38.466
You have to go further, you can watch these.. all these beautiful scenes,

02:38.485 --> 02:43.843
sit down there, enjoy yourself, but still you have to go with the stream.

02:43.905 --> 02:49.060
And then you go further and further, it's described it very well in his Tao.

02:49.060 --> 02:56.408
Tao means 'that it is' and it started showing such beautiful scenes

02:56.460 --> 03:01.395
sometimes that I really felt that I should get out of the boat and sit down there.

03:01.389 --> 03:06.669
But he was meaning that in your meditation when you are moving,

03:06.729 --> 03:14.335
you should not get tempted by this outward fascination of nature also

03:14.335 --> 03:19.252
but you enjoy, be one with it, you just see it, enjoy it

03:19.245 --> 03:27.901
and then he says that the river flows closer to the sea, that is the ultimate aim of the river,

03:27.901 --> 03:31.157
then she becomes absolutely silent

03:31.161 --> 03:36.966
and she spreads out and then gradually she moves towards the sea.

03:36.966 --> 03:39.252
It’s such a beautiful description

03:39.331 --> 03:45.348
and I have seen it myself and I can understand the poet, how he wanted to communicate,

03:45.360 --> 03:50.610
that how the nature should teach us, how to be meditative within ourselves.

03:51.899 --> 03:54.990
Buddha always talked about the Central Path

03:55.079 --> 04:01.497
and also he always said that our character is the mainstay.

04:01.586 --> 04:07.709
If you don’t have good character, then it is very difficult to ascend.

04:07.710 --> 04:10.770
These were the days when really this was the position.

04:15.550 --> 04:25.610
In India there were horrible, cruel kings and then they were killing people just for land or something.

04:27.490 --> 04:33.249
This was so much in India,

04:33.319 --> 04:39.879
that Buddha if he had not come it would have not stopped

04:39.869 --> 04:44.430
and gradually when the awakening came within them,

04:44.480 --> 04:46.730
that this is something wrong they are doing.

04:46.810 --> 04:51.269
They should not kill human beings for just getting some land.

04:51.278 --> 04:53.206
What is the use of this thing?

04:54.850 --> 05:00.692
Ultimately one king, saw the blood flowing through one river

05:00.713 --> 05:06.283
and he got such a repentance about what he had done,

05:06.382 --> 05:10.937
that he went to Buddha and told him that, "Sir please save me,

05:10.997 --> 05:18.161
I am very guilty about what I have been doing and I don’t think I can live any longer with this guilt."

05:18.151 --> 05:22.918
So Buddha pacified him and he became a Buddhist.

05:22.918 --> 05:31.430
Now in Sahaja Yoga we have a way by which we become one with reality,

05:31.423 --> 05:36.180
one with this All-Pervading Power.

05:36.278 --> 05:39.487
So the first point, if is the truth, is this,

05:39.557 --> 05:43.617
that you are not this body, this mind,

05:43.627 --> 05:48.218
or this ego or your conditionings,

05:48.298 --> 05:51.869
but what you are, you are a pure Spirit,

05:51.869 --> 05:57.028
which is said by Christ, said by all these great prophets. Everybody has said that

05:58.627 --> 06:05.708
and then second truth is that there is an All-Pervading Power of Divine Love.

06:05.718 --> 06:10.766
You see the flowers of Sydney, so beautiful, one better than the other.

06:10.793 --> 06:13.923
And see how they have grown.

06:13.939 --> 06:17.228
We never think that there is something miracle about them.

06:17.927 --> 06:23.014
It is a miracle, the way they have grown out of the Mother Earth with such a beauty.

06:23.028 --> 06:27.384
After all we cannot do that.

06:27.398 --> 06:34.324
Mother Earth has done it and we take all those living works for granted.

06:34.326 --> 06:37.576
We don’t even think who runs our heart.

06:37.658 --> 06:41.098
We don’t even think who digests our food.

06:41.028 --> 06:44.502
What is that energy which does all these things,

06:44.562 --> 06:50.415
which controls our heights and everything else that is living?

06:50.423 --> 06:55.257
So there is a power of All-Pervading Love

06:55.276 --> 07:01.175
and that is the one, which really has created us

07:01.175 --> 07:06.185
and that is the one, which is going to give us our Realisation.

07:06.254 --> 07:11.514
This energy that is within us is what we call as the Kundalini.

07:11.574 --> 07:13.403
He must have told you about it,

07:13.495 --> 07:16.935
is the reflection of this All-Pervading Power

07:16.925 --> 07:19.156
which is settled in our sacrum bone.

07:19.206 --> 07:26.735
Sacrum as you know is called ‘Sacred’ by the people who were Greeks.

07:26.725 --> 07:29.062
They were not Indians and they called this ‘Sacred Bone’.

07:29.132 --> 07:32.502
I asked the curator, “Why do you call it as sacrum?”

07:32.562 --> 07:37.324
He said “We were told it's a sacred bone and there is energy of the Mother inside it.”

07:37.384 --> 07:41.935
I was amazed that these Greeks knew about it.

07:41.944 --> 07:49.701
And it's so surprising, that for ancient times we knew about in India, about this energy that is within us,

07:49.706 --> 07:57.990
but somehow or other it was the tradition, not to talk about it or give Self-Realisation to people en masse.

07:58.050 --> 08:02.790
One teacher will have only one student.

08:02.800 --> 08:05.290
One guru will have one disciple, that's all

08:05.382 --> 08:10.153
and he would just select one out of thousands and give Realisation to one

08:10.146 --> 08:12.963
and tell him the secret of Kundalini.

08:12.970 --> 08:18.004
It was going on for ages together till the 12th Century there was a big poet.

08:17.899 --> 08:29.545
We had a very great poet, who at the age of 31 years wrote tremendous secrets about spiritual life.

08:29.562 --> 08:32.764
I mean, it's unbelievable at this young age,

08:32.774 --> 08:35.676
because he died after that

08:35.744 --> 08:39.057
and then he is one who wrote in his book,

08:39.065 --> 08:44.815
after taking permission from his guru, that this Kundalini is one she does all the job.

08:44.835 --> 08:49.335
But people who were in charge of Hindu religion at the time, were just like priest every where.

08:49.413 --> 08:53.927
They said this chapter is no good, this is 'Nishidh.'

08:53.989 --> 08:58.192
We are not to deal with this. It is to be avoided.

08:58.187 --> 09:00.442
So nobody paid attention to that fact,

09:00.494 --> 09:04.244
but in the 16th century we had lots of poets in our country,

09:04.331 --> 09:07.272
who have sang the praise of this Kundalini.

09:07.322 --> 09:11.951
Also in Bible, there is that, “I will appear before you like tongues of flames.”

09:12.042 --> 09:15.091
And these chakras look like that,

09:15.041 --> 09:19.158
Inside, they are very mild tongues of flames.

09:19.173 --> 09:25.014
So all these things though little bit described in the Bible, described in the Koran, everywhere,

09:25.076 --> 09:32.365
but there was no proper, intelligible knowledge about Kundalini I would say,

09:32.446 --> 09:41.094
though in India they had. There was a kind of a

09:41.081 --> 09:47.000
you can call religious experiments which were called as NathPanthis.

09:47.052 --> 09:51.490
These people are the same who had only one disciple,

09:51.538 --> 09:56.051
one guru sort of thing, but later on it just spread out

09:56.100 --> 10:01.364
and we had lots of people in the 16th century who started talking about Kundalini

10:01.365 --> 10:08.907
and saying about it. So that’s how we have this knowledge in that county since long.

10:08.985 --> 10:14.657
But after the British came, it all became nonsense and nobody bothered for 300 hundred years

10:14.735 --> 10:22.181
and all this knowledge has gone into kind of a cupboard from where it came out.

10:22.211 --> 10:27.711
Now, I knew about it myself, but I wanted to find out a method

10:27.719 --> 10:33.019
by which we could give Realisation en masse, not to one person.

10:33.139 --> 10:41.062
If you give to one person, everybody will get after him, or crucify him, or kill him, or give poison or get out.

10:42.379 --> 10:49.240
Now the time also has come, this is the time that we say in the Bible is the judgement,

10:49.259 --> 10:51.283
the Last Judgement,

10:51.293 --> 10:57.490
but in Koran it's very clearly written. See how all the truths are the same everywhere.

10:57.519 --> 11:03.182
The Koran it is written that at this time, which they call Qiyamah, the Resurrection Time,

11:03.243 --> 11:07.692
"Your hands will speak and they will give witness against you."

11:07.753 --> 11:12.812
So actually when you get your Realisation, you start feeling the energy in your hand

11:13.971 --> 11:17.211
and you can verify,

11:17.860 --> 11:22.941
you can verify what centres are catching and it’s tangible.

11:23.710 --> 11:28.090
As you know, that in Delhi there are three doctors who have already got MD

11:28.149 --> 11:32.312
for curing incurable diseases, through Sahaja Yoga.

11:32.322 --> 11:40.480
Now for diagnosis you don’t have to go in to that horrible, gruelling experience of diagnosis.

11:40.542 --> 11:43.392
Just you can feel it on your fingertips.

11:43.461 --> 11:45.908
You can know what's wrong with you

11:45.927 --> 11:52.490
and its absolutely curable. I tell you frankly, that definitely people have been cured of blood cancers.

11:52.490 --> 11:54.734
They have been cured about 9-10 years back.

11:54.822 --> 11:57.432
They are still living and they're quite hale and hearty.

11:57.494 --> 12:05.721
We have seen that people who are suffering from all kinds of incurable diseases are cured,

12:05.791 --> 12:10.091
but they have to enter into a new state of awareness

12:10.100 --> 12:13.341
that is what we call is the Sahaja Yoga state,

12:13.421 --> 12:16.490
where you become one with this Divine Power.

12:16.581 --> 12:19.480
Then this power starts flowing through you.

12:21.096 --> 12:24.296
Most of the world’s problems, if you see come from human beings

12:24.346 --> 12:29.278
not from nature, more from human beings and the nature reacts to it.

12:30.495 --> 12:34.163
Now when you get these problems

12:34.163 --> 12:38.413
you start running about here and there and trying to find out solutions.

12:38.423 --> 12:41.322
The solution is within.

12:41.341 --> 12:45.817
Within our centres, when these centres are in jeopardy,

12:45.865 --> 12:49.388
you get all these physical, mental, emotional problems

12:49.394 --> 12:52.336
for yourself and for the whole society, for the whole world.

12:53.711 --> 12:56.461
So now what should we do?

12:56.474 --> 13:03.860
Is to correct these centres by the awakening of this Kundalini, which passes through six centres.

13:03.870 --> 13:05.870
These centres get enlightened

13:05.951 --> 13:11.777
and that enlightenment cures them, nourishes them and integrates them.

13:11.791 --> 13:17.176
Then you are completely one with this All-Pervading Power

13:17.264 --> 13:20.663
and the correction becomes permanent.

13:20.734 --> 13:26.625
At that time they say that it starts flowing through you, you can feel it on your fingertips

13:26.657 --> 13:31.171
and by that you develop all your potential powers which are so many,

13:31.221 --> 13:34.801
so many that in this small lecture I may not be able to tell you the whole,

13:34.850 --> 13:37.591
but some of them I will be able to tell you,

13:37.639 --> 13:41.923
that the first thing happens to you that you achieve a state of peace.

13:43.085 --> 13:47.860
You are thinking of tomorrow, or of yesterday past and future,

13:47.932 --> 13:49.500
but present we are not there.

13:49.532 --> 13:54.586
Present is not known to us

13:54.697 --> 13:56.899
and reality is in the present.

13:56.956 --> 14:02.889
So when you are thinking of the past and future, you are jumping on the cusp of those thoughts.

14:02.951 --> 14:07.399
In between these thoughts, there is space which we call as Vilamba in Sanskrit,

14:07.500 --> 14:09.451
is 'the pause'.

14:09.528 --> 14:14.668
and that is the time when you are in present, which is very short

14:14.677 --> 14:17.370
and that’s why you can never be in the present.

14:17.460 --> 14:21.840
So, when the Kundalini rises, your attention is driven inside

14:21.850 --> 14:27.278
and these thoughts expand, in the sense that they elongate

14:27.298 --> 14:31.346
and there is the space in between is quite big.

14:31.418 --> 14:40.138
Thus you establish yourself into a new state and a new dimension of your awareness,

14:40.143 --> 14:43.604
which we call as Thoughtless Awareness.

14:43.618 --> 14:45.331
That is the meditation.

14:45.355 --> 14:49.474
You cannot do meditation you have to be in meditation,

14:49.488 --> 14:51.437
it's a state.

14:51.437 --> 14:54.903
Then there is no thought, but you are fully aware.

14:54.980 --> 15:00.369
Whatever you see is recorded like a picture in your mind

15:00.373 --> 15:04.163
and such tremendous changes take place in human beings,

15:04.221 --> 15:05.778
they are surprised.

15:05.788 --> 15:16.028
Like very ordinary person, who was playing once a instrument before me was very boring to begin with

15:16.042 --> 15:18.009
and suddenly I don’t know what happened to him.

15:18.061 --> 15:25.475
His Kundalini was awakened and he was playing such beautiful music and today he is a world famous man.

15:25.504 --> 15:28.798
There are very powerful Sahaja Yogis in the world now

15:28.898 --> 15:35.028
and I am so very happy that this has happened to people, that they have felt their own energy

15:35.076 --> 15:38.423
and they have felt their own peace.

15:38.423 --> 15:40.081
The second state that you achieve,

15:40.134 --> 15:43.701
what we call, this is the Thoughtless Awareness

15:43.783 --> 15:48.567
and the second one is called as the Doubtless Awareness.

15:48.638 --> 15:56.798
Patanjali in his yoga has said, called them, as Nirvichar Samadhi and Nirvikalap Samadhi.

15:57.682 --> 16:00.474
Now these two states if you have achieved,

16:00.533 --> 16:04.033
then all your powers you know what you have.

16:04.104 --> 16:05.822
You know all your inner being.

16:05.884 --> 16:13.556
You know your chakras and you know all the three... What should I say? The Autonomous Nervous System.

16:13.783 --> 16:17.254
like para-sympathetic, sympathetic systems, everything you know

16:17.312 --> 16:21.494
and you know how to control them, how to improve them, how to work them out.

16:23.283 --> 16:25.604
So you become your own master.

16:27.009 --> 16:33.123
Firstly when you are awakened, firstly what you get is all your talents.

16:33.182 --> 16:35.942
For example: I see Australians are great artists.

16:36.003 --> 16:41.176
I have seen people who have come to Sahaja Yoga become such deep artist

16:41.195 --> 16:44.975
and such beautiful artist, aesthetically so rich.

16:45.125 --> 16:50.230
It is because whatever you know is very little

16:50.245 --> 16:55.638
and the whole dynamism of your creativity just explodes

16:55.725 --> 16:58.898
and you start producing things which are very soothing,

16:58.947 --> 17:05.727
which are very beautiful, which makes every one so happy.

17:05.721 --> 17:11.537
It’s not some sort of nonsensical thing you do some queer thing just to please the people

17:11.547 --> 17:15.336
and show off that you are a great designer and this and that.

17:15.355 --> 17:16.766
No.

17:16.826 --> 17:23.432
You do it natural, honest reproduction of what you feel

17:23.451 --> 17:29.824
and that feeling is absolutely divine and thus you produce really classical, beautiful things,

17:29.894 --> 17:35.788
which is very surprising how these modern children have taken to it.

17:35.788 --> 17:41.441
Normally the Modern Art, as you know is mostly understood by the artist himself.

17:41.500 --> 17:47.355
Nobody else can understand it, because they just go mad and do all kinds of things.

17:47.365 --> 17:49.596
In this also you may do Modern Art,

17:49.605 --> 17:53.509
means in the sense that you break all the lines and everything,

17:53.509 --> 17:59.423
but, what you find that whatever you do is extremely soothing

17:59.423 --> 18:03.056
and natural, one with the nature

18:03.125 --> 18:08.557
and anybody who sees that will say, "Who has made this sort of

18:08.548 --> 18:12.048
an expression of the true feeling from within;

18:12.152 --> 18:16.028
nothing artificial, nothing vulgar, nothing nonsensical."

18:16.903 --> 18:20.911
In the same way musicians and other things in every art...

18:20.932 --> 18:24.778
I was, I have been really amazed how Sahaja Yoga has helped.

18:24.846 --> 18:31.144
I have seen this Sydney Sahaja Yogis singing to you this Marathi and Sanskrit songs and Hindi songs,

18:31.142 --> 18:33.711
which not even Indians can sing.

18:33.778 --> 18:34.922
They cannot sing so well,

18:34.971 --> 18:39.894
I mean if you hear them from outside, nobody will know they are people from Australia.

18:39.913 --> 18:43.471
They are Australians, as if some Indians are singing it's very difficult.

18:43.574 --> 18:48.663
Indian singing is extremely difficult, people practice for years together to achieve this.

18:48.769 --> 18:53.009
Not only that they know it, but also so many of them know it by heart

18:53.009 --> 18:57.298
and I don’t know how they have picked it up, this I just don’t understand.

18:57.313 --> 18:58.913
Then they come and sing in India.

18:58.971 --> 19:03.240
Even so many artists have said, "Now we are ashamed, the way these people are doing

19:03.269 --> 19:06.144
At such a young age, how they have picked it so well.

19:06.198 --> 19:08.875
They sing in such beautiful unison."

19:08.894 --> 19:10.894
All these things happen to you.

19:10.913 --> 19:14.682
Secondly it happens, that so-called religions that you have, you follow.

19:14.663 --> 19:20.698
Somebody will say, "I'm a Buddhist." Somebody will say, "I am a Christian, I am Hindu, Muslim," anything.

19:20.748 --> 19:23.875
They can commit any sins, it's outward.

19:23.872 --> 19:25.269
It's just a label.

19:25.259 --> 19:29.652
Like one girl met me and she was saying, "I am born again." I said, "You are not.

19:29.672 --> 19:33.451
You just label yourself as 'Born Again', you are not.

19:33.467 --> 19:37.317
Unless and until you get your realisation, you cannot be born again

19:37.423 --> 19:42.797
and once you are born again, you get the quality of a personality who is a born again

19:42.788 --> 19:46.557
has so many powers, so compassionate, so peaceful.

19:46.583 --> 19:49.247
"You are not." I said, "You are in a delusion."

19:49.257 --> 19:52.384
She asked me, "Are you born again?" I said, "I am, of course I am

19:52.326 --> 19:54.855
and you can be also if you want to,

19:54.913 --> 19:58.364
but if you want to carry on with artificial levels, what can you do?

19:58.394 --> 20:00.776
what good have they done to anyone?"

20:01.692 --> 20:08.567
So the artificiality drops out and your real personality starts expressing itself.

20:08.548 --> 20:13.028
As far as the religion is concerned, you become absolutely righteous.

20:14.778 --> 20:17.067
The other day, I was reading about the genes

20:17.125 --> 20:19.912
and I was amazed to hear that the

20:19.913 --> 20:23.171
Asians have two genes to protect them,

20:23.171 --> 20:25.365
but the Western people have none.

20:26.096 --> 20:29.346
Now, the two genes that are within us,

20:29.423 --> 20:33.865
one is, I would say, comes from the mother,

20:33.875 --> 20:37.008
may be the father, or the society, or whatever it is,

20:37.748 --> 20:43.395
but one we call in Sahaja Yoga, 'sin against the Mother' and 'sin against the Father',

20:43.413 --> 20:45.806
out of which the left side,

20:45.836 --> 20:50.027
when we are there, we are sinning against the Mother,

20:50.105 --> 20:52.987
means we become immoral.

20:52.987 --> 20:55.923
We don’t know what is morality.

20:55.932 --> 20:59.576
We start playing with things, which we should not.

20:59.660 --> 21:05.373
Then we get into trouble, we get diseases, this, that, all sorts of problems,

21:05.432 --> 21:07.545
because there is no protection.

21:07.596 --> 21:09.333
So we are very vulnerable.

21:10.009 --> 21:13.221
All kinds of indulgences and all kinds of habits,

21:13.230 --> 21:17.913
that we form, which are self-destructive, is sin against the Mother.

21:18.423 --> 21:26.557
The another gene, is the one that protects you against, the sin against the Father

21:26.615 --> 21:31.134
and sin against the Father, is to be dishonest,

21:31.237 --> 21:34.836
to be corrupt, not to believe that God is your Father.

21:34.826 --> 21:36.403
Why should we do all this thing?

21:36.457 --> 21:39.961
So this kind of a sin also, we start doing.

21:39.977 --> 21:43.094
Both these genes that are protective,

21:43.163 --> 21:46.218
are created after Sahaja Yoga within you

21:46.240 --> 21:47.913
and you just don’t do wrong things.

21:47.923 --> 21:50.688
I have seen people from West, how they were.

21:50.701 --> 21:52.807
They give up all kinds of nonsense.

21:52.817 --> 21:56.720
We never have the problem of somebody's wife running away with somebody,

21:56.730 --> 21:58.825
somebody's daughter running away with somebody.

21:58.880 --> 22:01.740
Some rape and all that, it's out of question.

22:01.730 --> 22:04.682
We have thousands and thousands of Sahaja Yogis

22:04.730 --> 22:07.169
and they come together many a times.

22:07.199 --> 22:11.865
I have never seen them quarrelling, fighting have any violence or anything.

22:11.894 --> 22:14.788
So this, the sin against the Father and sin against the Mother,

22:14.846 --> 22:19.778
just is sort of established, that they just don’t do it.

22:19.942 --> 22:23.123
They dress up properly. They live properly. They don’t take to drugs.

22:23.182 --> 22:25.297
They don’t take all these things.

22:25.333 --> 22:34.535
Now you know the progeny, how it is facing the effects of this modern life.

22:34.536 --> 22:38.736
Like you see, the children are left to dogs,

22:38.817 --> 22:40.281
they become so horrible.

22:40.300 --> 22:43.560
I have seen in Miami with my own eyes,

22:43.582 --> 22:47.567
children who were only 12 years of age, were carrying revolvers

22:47.556 --> 22:49.067
and were selling drugs,

22:49.125 --> 22:54.365
because the law is such, that they do not punish 12 years old children in the jail,

22:54.384 --> 22:59.086
so people are taking advantage of these children and they are behaving like this.

22:59.093 --> 23:01.368
There are children who are killing their parents.

23:01.410 --> 23:03.549
There are parents who are killing their children.

23:03.559 --> 23:07.500
This kind of a violence is the sin against the Father.

23:07.509 --> 23:12.798
So both ways you see, if there is sort of an attack.

23:12.900 --> 23:15.605
What will happen to such a society?

23:15.624 --> 23:18.478
Is important one has to take to spiritual life

23:18.538 --> 23:21.121
and the spiritual life of not outside,

23:21.181 --> 23:27.431
that you just go to church, sing some hymn numbers, this and that and come home.

23:27.461 --> 23:30.548
This is not that, it has to be innate, within yourself.

23:30.625 --> 23:31.804
You have to be honest.

23:31.932 --> 23:34.182
You have to be integrated with yourself

23:34.240 --> 23:42.044
and then this innate religion will tell you, that you belong to the religion, which is a universal religion,

23:42.124 --> 23:45.000
which encompasses all the religions,

23:45.000 --> 23:50.517
which respects all the great incarnations, all the prophets, every one.

23:51.182 --> 23:57.518
Every religion is a flower on the tree of life,

23:57.586 --> 23:59.336
of spirituality,

23:59.403 --> 24:02.288
but you have taken away that flower

24:02.278 --> 24:05.198
and you are fighting with the dead flower. "This is mine." "This is mine."

24:05.258 --> 24:09.296
You have no claims and is the dead flower which is now petrified

24:09.403 --> 24:12.846
and that’s how you see in every religion what problems are coming.

24:12.913 --> 24:17.855
How people are suffering. How they are fighting. All kinds of things happen.

24:17.910 --> 24:22.298
So people become, they say, "We don’t believe in God."

24:22.326 --> 24:23.865
They become atheist.

24:23.880 --> 24:26.574
When they become atheist also, they are doing the wrong thing

24:26.576 --> 24:30.490
and those who believe in God, in such a way, are also wrong.

24:30.519 --> 24:32.361
It’s a blind faith.

24:32.351 --> 24:36.298
With Sahaja Yoga, I must tell you one thing, you shouldn’t have blind faith.

24:36.911 --> 24:40.480
If you feel the experience of Realisation,

24:40.500 --> 24:45.769
then of course, as honest people, you must accept, respect it and go-ahead with it and grow.

24:45.817 --> 24:50.286
But if you don’t feel the experience, you shouldn’t tell lies.

24:50.346 --> 24:54.246
You should come again and again. See that you get your Realisation.

24:55.000 --> 24:57.699
There are so many things, as I told you, I could tell you,

24:57.769 --> 25:01.721
but only the attention part I have told you, that attention gets enlightened

25:01.749 --> 25:04.429
and wherever you put your attention it works.

25:04.509 --> 25:06.884
It helps.

25:06.894 --> 25:10.134
So in a way you start living collectively.

25:10.228 --> 25:14.980
You start feeling that you are part and parcel of one whole being.

25:15.000 --> 25:17.402
The microcosm becomes the macrocosm,

25:17.392 --> 25:19.582
a drops becomes the ocean

25:19.662 --> 25:22.250
and that’s how the whole world can become one,

25:22.304 --> 25:25.814
one day and all these problems and things will go away,

25:25.884 --> 25:28.701
because through Sahaja Yoga you know Absolute Truth.

25:28.769 --> 25:31.814
Everybody knows the same truth, no quarrel,

25:31.883 --> 25:34.921
as you are watching me, I am sitting down here.

25:34.932 --> 25:38.288
All of you feel the same about everything.

25:38.298 --> 25:42.394
So there are no discussions, no arguments, no fighting, nothing

25:42.423 --> 25:45.134
and you really become a peaceful personality.

25:45.211 --> 25:47.750
You emit peace, as I told you.

25:49.942 --> 25:51.788
So,

25:51.788 --> 25:56.930
the highest thing is that you enter into to the Kingdom of God.

25:57.009 --> 26:02.053
Somebody told me today, “Mother, they... people don’t know what is Kingdom of God.”

26:02.104 --> 26:04.692
So I said, “They have to enter in to see."

26:04.846 --> 26:09.727
Unless and until I enter into this hall, how will I know what this hall is like.

26:09.777 --> 26:16.701
So once they enter into it, they write to me, that Mother we are now in the Kingdom of God,

26:16.711 --> 26:21.344
because you start... drowned into,

26:21.509 --> 26:25.188
you feel you are drowned into the ocean of joy

26:25.238 --> 26:29.596
and joy is not double like happiness and unhappiness.

26:29.653 --> 26:35.018
Supposing you have... your ego is pampered.

26:35.076 --> 26:38.836
You feel very happy, that I am such and such, I have got this

26:38.942 --> 26:41.977
and if any is punctured you feel unhappy,

26:42.027 --> 26:47.006
but joy is singular, it's in that state, from where you witness your life.

26:47.006 --> 26:51.451
In a one lecture, program, I don’t think I will able tell you all about it.

26:51.526 --> 26:57.393
I must have given at least four thousand lectures in only English language.

26:57.403 --> 27:03.288
So I have to tell you one thing, that today whatever is happening in Sahaja Yoga

27:03.288 --> 27:06.548
is the culmination of your evolution,

27:06.605 --> 27:10.105
culmination of all spiritual work,

27:10.153 --> 27:14.515
that people have done, all the saints, prophets and incarnations

27:14.525 --> 27:21.365
and is the last judgement for you, so that you enter into the Kingdom of God.

27:21.393 --> 27:24.086
Sahaja means ‘born with you’.

27:24.113 --> 27:26.971
‘Saha’ is ‘with’. ‘Ja’ is ‘born’

27:27.063 --> 27:30.201
Born with you is the right

27:30.256 --> 27:35.316
to become united, which means yoga, with this All-Pervading Power.

27:35.384 --> 27:37.823
It is your birthright,

27:37.836 --> 27:39.692
because you are born at this time

27:39.750 --> 27:41.756
and this should happen,

27:41.750 --> 27:46.413
but after that please remember, that you might feel very great about it

27:46.476 --> 27:51.266
and you may just enjoy it individually, but it’s not an individual growth.

27:51.326 --> 27:54.585
You have to come to our Centres.

27:54.605 --> 27:57.644
You don’t have to pay for it.

27:57.701 --> 28:01.365
Some people think that this is an introduction lecture so there's no payment.

28:01.355 --> 28:04.130
You can't pay for living thing. How can you pay?

28:04.179 --> 28:10.256
How can pay for the seed which is planted in the Mother Earth?

28:10.276 --> 28:14.604
How can you pay to the Mother Earth or to the seed? It’s all built in.

28:14.614 --> 28:16.064
In the same way it's built in to you.

28:16.134 --> 28:21.390
Of course for formally I use to come Australia with my own money and all that,

28:21.394 --> 28:25.728
but now we have so many Sahaja Yogis, that they want pay for my travel,

28:25.778 --> 28:31.438
may be for this hall they might have paid, but you don’t have to pay for your Self-Realisation

28:31.508 --> 28:35.307
and all the knowledge of your being, inner being,

28:35.375 --> 28:39.596
your powers and everything, for that you don’t have to pay.

28:39.669 --> 28:42.871
All these little expenses, which is very little,

28:42.941 --> 28:49.557
partly I should say, are taken over by so many Sahaja Yogis that you have.

28:49.621 --> 28:56.519
In Sydney itself, you have lots of Sahaja Yogis. They told me there are 22 centres in Sydney.

28:56.604 --> 29:02.940
So you all can take full advantage of it, but you must respect yourself,

29:02.942 --> 29:06.548
you must respect your Self-Realisation.

29:06.557 --> 29:09.903
After all, you must be something special to get it.

29:09.910 --> 29:11.740
So please don’t neglect it.

29:11.798 --> 29:15.652
There is no mesmerism to keep you attached to Sahaja Yoga.

29:15.740 --> 29:22.278
There is no other temptations, but one that you have to be one with this All-Pervading Power

29:22.362 --> 29:26.932
and this Kundalini is the pure desire, the power of pure desire.

29:26.968 --> 29:30.394
You are aware of if it, or you may not be aware of it,

29:30.498 --> 29:36.105
that you have only one pure desire is to be one with all this All-Pervading Power,

29:36.115 --> 29:42.728
because all other desires if you see, once they are fulfilled, they are of no importance to you.

29:42.798 --> 29:48.605
So it is said that, in general wants are not satiable.

29:48.615 --> 29:53.596
You never feel satisfied, but after this complete satisfaction comes in to you

29:53.644 --> 29:55.884
and you start enjoying everything,

29:55.967 --> 30:00.269
enjoying other people, enjoying your own relations,

30:00.364 --> 30:02.461
enjoying the whole world.

30:02.932 --> 30:07.913
This is such a blissful time, that you are born. Take full advantage of it

30:07.932 --> 30:11.401
and pay full attention to yourself

30:11.480 --> 30:16.076
and understand that just by labelling yourself as something, you do not become that.

30:16.086 --> 30:21.961
Do not fight for something that is artificial, but achieve something that is real.

30:22.053 --> 30:27.971
Thank you very much. I hope after one year again I will come back here and meet you.

30:28.083 --> 30:32.971
By that time all of you will grow up like big trees of spirituality,

30:33.019 --> 30:39.063
giving such vibrations and Realisation, that power you will have, that

30:39.133 --> 30:44.037
you can give Realisation, you can cure people, you can help people.

30:44.050 --> 30:49.038
Some people who have never been orators, have become great orators of Sahaja Yoga

30:49.015 --> 30:53.469
and all over the world you have brothers and sisters who are sincerely yours.

30:53.471 --> 30:54.489
May God Bless you.

30:54.499 --> 30:56.229
Thank you very much.

31:03.479 --> 31:05.038
I can't see the people.

31:08.785 --> 31:13.394
Can you ask them to put the light off, so that I can see the people.

31:20.996 --> 31:27.192
There is one thing more that I cannot force Self-Realisation on you.

31:27.266 --> 31:30.750
All of you can get it. Must just have confidence.

31:30.803 --> 31:35.990
All can get it, but if you don’t want to have it, I cannot force on you.

31:36.471 --> 31:37.875
I respect your freedom

31:38.951 --> 31:43.865
and I have to request people, if they don’t want to have it, they should leave the hall.

31:43.923 --> 31:50.025
That’s much better and otherwise I am sure it will work out for all of you.

31:54.336 --> 31:57.432
Can you ask them to reduce the light a little bit?

31:57.517 --> 31:59.673
Put the light, that side.

32:00.432 --> 32:01.653
It’s too much.

32:04.938 --> 32:08.278
Also reduce this one, it’s not too much light on me?

32:09.063 --> 32:11.083
Can’t see anyone.

32:28.942 --> 32:32.074
Till I give Realisation please reduce, this is too much.

32:32.884 --> 32:36.844
I never used to wear these glasses, but for these kind of things

32:42.192 --> 32:45.115
No, no, no these big things.

32:51.133 --> 32:52.779
I want to see them.

32:56.259 --> 32:59.403
We need to douse these overheads. Thank you.

33:02.596 --> 33:05.554
Ah, that proves one thing,

33:05.622 --> 33:09.827
that if you are blinded by something like that,

33:09.832 --> 33:13.250
you can not see anything else, you see, so one has to…

33:21.500 --> 33:25.200
So again, I would request those who want to go should leave,

33:25.278 --> 33:29.496
will be good idea. It takes 10-15 minutes, not more than that,

33:29.625 --> 33:32.605
but it's…

33:32.855 --> 33:40.256
You go beyond your mind. You just go on thinking about it, this, that, then it won’t work out …

33:47.375 --> 33:49.134
So nice!

33:53.192 --> 33:54.785
Left Nabhi is there.

34:02.477 --> 34:06.586
So, before we start I have to tell you there are three conditions,

34:06.634 --> 34:08.947
which are very simple conditions.

34:10.907 --> 34:15.860
The first one is, that you have to be fully confident,

34:15.920 --> 34:19.110
that you all will get your Self-Realisation.

34:20.880 --> 34:23.402
So it follows the second condition,

34:23.483 --> 34:28.427
that you should in no way feel guilty about anything.

34:28.447 --> 34:30.347
It’s a fashion also, to feel guilty,

34:30.418 --> 34:35.628
all the time, saying “Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.” Even on the phone we use to say, “I beg your pardon,”

34:35.708 --> 34:38.521
but people say, “Sorry, sorry, sorry.”

34:38.527 --> 34:43.065
It’s a fashion. To feel guilty is really a fashion.

34:43.054 --> 34:47.931
If you have done anything wrong, just face it that moment and just leave it.

34:47.960 --> 34:52.518
But you carry on with it and that works on left Vishuddhi here,

34:52.588 --> 34:57.097
which is a very…very, very important thing,

34:57.898 --> 35:02.369
because if your left Vishuddhi is caught up,

35:02.400 --> 35:07.860
then, you can get spondylitis,

35:07.909 --> 35:10.469
which is a very horrible disease,

35:10.570 --> 35:13.713
or another one which is called, angina,

35:13.733 --> 35:17.143
or you may get very lethargic organs.

35:17.164 --> 35:20.652
So this is such an important centre, which you are spoiling,

35:20.704 --> 35:26.181
just with your imaginary… imaginary style of thinking,

35:26.202 --> 35:28.012
that you are guilty,

35:28.003 --> 35:32.523
that you have done this wrong. You should not have done that wrong and you feel guilty.

35:34.342 --> 35:37.161
Of course everybody has right to feel guilty.

35:37.184 --> 35:39.143
I cannot challenge that.

35:39.235 --> 35:43.875
They can feel. Everybody has right, even to cut their throat.

35:45.985 --> 35:49.530
But as a Mother, I am saying, "Better not."

35:49.610 --> 35:53.940
Why to do something which is injurious to us, good for nothing?

35:54.001 --> 35:57.795
And at this moment, when you are about to get your Realisation,

35:57.806 --> 35:59.655
you miss the point

35:59.675 --> 36:02.255
This is the greatest thing that you are going to you have.

36:02.255 --> 36:05.117
All your powers are going to express themselves.

36:05.146 --> 36:08.447
All your glory you are going to know.

36:08.478 --> 36:12.547
At this time what is the use of feel guilty and condemning yourself?

36:13.396 --> 36:18.259
So just, what you have to say in your heart is that, “Mother I am not guilty at all.”

36:18.288 --> 36:19.349
That’s all.

36:19.358 --> 36:23.809
You don’t have to do anything, but in your heart, please say, just now in your heart

36:23.878 --> 36:26.869
that, “Mother I am not guilty at all.”

36:26.889 --> 36:28.380
Second point!

36:28.389 --> 36:30.869
So now two conditions I have told you.

36:32.463 --> 36:34.402
The third condition is very simple.

36:34.452 --> 36:39.322
The third condition is that you have to forgive everyone.

36:39.344 --> 36:41.364
According to some people it’s very difficult.

36:41.422 --> 36:46.431
They cannot forgive, but logically try to understand.

36:46.443 --> 36:49.184
If you forgive or don’t forgive, what do you do?

36:50.293 --> 36:51.123
Nothing.

36:52.393 --> 36:56.702
Both ways you do nothing. You just think, “I cannot forgive, I cannot forgive.”

36:59.541 --> 37:05.101
But if you don’t forgive, then you play in to wrong hands.

37:06.572 --> 37:10.416
If you don’t forgive, then you play in to wrong hands definitely,

37:10.416 --> 37:14.126
because the person who has harmed you, or troubled you,

37:14.137 --> 37:22.155
will always try to deviate the matter. He wouldn't bother to see that I have trouble that person or anything,

37:22.295 --> 37:26.226
but you are the one, who will be troubling yourself

37:26.286 --> 37:29.463
and all the time torturing yourself. All the time saying

37:29.514 --> 37:33.605
that. “I cannot forgive this man. I cannot forgive man.”

37:33.626 --> 37:36.505
That person might have even forgotten you all.

37:38.076 --> 37:40.179
So there is no logic in it,

37:40.300 --> 37:44.679
but more over, when you do not forgive then, the centre, Agnya,

37:44.739 --> 37:46.059
which is on the optic chiasma

37:46.070 --> 37:50.699
is like this, constructed like this, absolutely like this

37:50.730 --> 37:55.583
and to open this you have to forgive, otherwise how will the Kundalini pass.

37:55.643 --> 37:57.652
It has to open,

37:57.753 --> 38:02.003
only by forgiving every one. You don’t have to think about whom

38:02.063 --> 38:05.833
you have to forgive, what they have given, how to forgive,

38:05.963 --> 38:11.293
how to do it, just say that, “I forgive everyone in general.”

38:11.353 --> 38:12.963
You don’t have to think about them.

38:14.074 --> 38:17.304
At this moment, if you say that, you'll feel much lighter.

38:18.347 --> 38:20.760
So these are the three conditions we have

38:20.820 --> 38:27.190
and I think it’s not difficult to do it, if you see the logic behind it.

38:30.349 --> 38:34.619
Now as I told you, it takes about 10-15 minutes that’s all.

38:34.648 --> 38:37.527
All those who want to do it can do it.

38:37.597 --> 38:40.489
Those who don’t want it, I cannot force,

38:40.570 --> 38:41.951
so they should leave.

38:42.041 --> 38:43.510
There are very simple things,

38:45.931 --> 38:47.570
for which people object.

38:48.335 --> 38:53.400
Now I don’t know if it’s too much to do, but if you can take out your shoes,

38:53.400 --> 38:55.833
it helps a lot. This Mother Earth helps us.

38:56.704 --> 39:00.643
She is a living body and she sucks in our problems.

39:00.704 --> 39:03.393
She sucks in our heat.

39:03.463 --> 39:09.025
So I will be thankful, if you could take out your shoes and keep them away.

39:10.675 --> 39:15.025
Even this could be a too much condition for the Western people sometimes, in England.

39:19.646 --> 39:24.083
It’s not so cold also, you can keep your socks on.

39:24.103 --> 39:25.072
Now!

39:28.393 --> 39:31.329
You are quite comfortable and sit comfortably.

39:31.360 --> 39:34.072
You don’t have to stand on your heads.

39:34.132 --> 39:36.413
You don’t have to go to Himalayas,

39:36.463 --> 39:39.842
nothing. No starvation, no fasting, nothing,

39:39.902 --> 39:44.719
it’s something inside. It has nothing to do with your outside behaviour

39:47.409 --> 39:50.610
and surprisingly it’s all there, intact.

39:52.289 --> 39:55.686
If of course if you are suffering from some disease,

39:55.746 --> 39:59.257
may be you have been to some guru, who has harmed you, or something,

39:59.317 --> 40:03.949
then maybe it may not work out, but that’s one percent.

40:03.942 --> 40:08.402
But even those, who do not get Realisation, can get it later on

40:08.472 --> 40:11.590
and there are Sahaja Yogis who can give you Realisation.

40:11.710 --> 40:14.469
There is no problem on that.

40:15.489 --> 40:20.076
You are here means, you have already entered in to the Kingdom of the God,

40:20.085 --> 40:24.815
that you desire to have your Self-Realisation is the biggest thing.

40:25.916 --> 40:26.675
Now,

40:27.695 --> 40:31.967
what we have to do, is to put both the hands like this towards me,

40:31.976 --> 40:36.302
comfortably, again very comfortably, you can

40:36.306 --> 40:39.822
if you have the hand rest, you can put it on the hand rest,

40:39.827 --> 40:43.333
or like this both the hands towards me.

40:43.342 --> 40:46.282
Now, these are two powers,

40:46.282 --> 40:55.563
Alright now, will you go ahead a little bit there and show them, because everybody should see. I think it's better now.

40:55.672 --> 40:57.733
Can you see him all of you?

40:59.603 --> 41:00.902
Alright,

41:02.387 --> 41:03.143
So

41:03.233 --> 41:04.963
ha... now better.

41:06.713 --> 41:09.034
Now you put both the hands like this,

41:10.014 --> 41:17.143
as these two powers are different, we have put both the feet apart from each other.

41:20.643 --> 41:24.222
Now please put your right hand on your heart.

41:26.902 --> 41:29.992
And we will now show you, what we will have to do.

41:29.992 --> 41:34.431
In the Heart resides the Spirit,

41:34.583 --> 41:37.619
that’s the reflection of God Almighty.

41:39.898 --> 41:45.635
If you become the Spirit you become your own Master.

41:48.280 --> 41:50.255
So you take down your right hand

41:50.375 --> 41:53.014
on the lower portion of the abdomen,

41:53.085 --> 41:56.518
on the left hand side. We are just working on the left hand side

41:57.909 --> 42:02.710
and here is the centre of your Mastery,

42:05.454 --> 42:09.152
which is created by great masters and prophets,

42:09.143 --> 42:11.264
which you have to awaken.

42:11.704 --> 42:15.085
Now please take your right hand, on the lower portion of your abdomen,

42:16.835 --> 42:18.494
on the left side again.

42:20.505 --> 42:25.565
Surprisingly, this is the centre of Pure Divine Knowledge.

42:27.355 --> 42:31.362
You’ll later on know how it works. It’s very interesting.

42:32.969 --> 42:37.027
Now raise your hand again, in the upper portion of your abdomen.

42:37.429 --> 42:38.688
Please.

42:39.259 --> 42:43.862
And then, raise your right hand on your Heart again.

42:45.592 --> 42:49.251
Now put right your hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder

42:49.311 --> 42:52.210
and turn head to the your right.

42:52.262 --> 42:58.862
This is the centre, I have told you, when you are guilty it is caught and how it is dangerous.

42:59.791 --> 43:05.891
Now, take your right hand on top of your forehead across

43:05.942 --> 43:07.351
and put down your head.

43:07.742 --> 43:13.501
This is the centre for forgiving others.

43:17.871 --> 43:20.552
Now please take your right hand on the back side of your head.

43:20.572 --> 43:23.452
Push back your head. These are all the centres.

43:23.442 --> 43:26.702
Now this centre is very important

43:26.822 --> 43:29.922
without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes,

43:30.021 --> 43:35.438
for your satisfaction, you will have to ask for forgiveness from this All-Pervading Power.

43:36.538 --> 43:39.038
Then, please stretch your palm, fully,

43:39.978 --> 43:42.447
stretch your palm. It's the last centre,

43:42.547 --> 43:47.507
which is on the fontanel bone area.

43:47.597 --> 43:52.956
So put the centre of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area,

43:52.967 --> 43:56.416
which may be hot, which may be cool.

43:56.436 --> 44:00.088
Now push back your fingers. This is important.

44:00.108 --> 44:06.369
Please push back your fingers, so there is good pressure on your scalp.

44:06.378 --> 44:10.239
Please bend your head as far as possible

44:10.297 --> 44:15.099
and now move your right hand fully,

44:16.838 --> 44:21.485
moving the scalp with the pressure seven times.

44:22.875 --> 44:25.440
Please bend your head that’s important.

44:29.965 --> 44:31.775
That’s all we have to do.

44:33.983 --> 44:39.713
Now again please close your eyes

44:39.824 --> 44:42.454
and you will have to open them till I tell you.

44:42.514 --> 44:49.101
But before that, see that your both the legs or feet are apart from each other.

44:49.112 --> 44:54.353
Left hand is on your lap or comfortably put toward me like this.

44:54.431 --> 44:58.543
And now put your right hand on your heart.

44:59.632 --> 45:02.913
You can take out your spectacles. It will help you,

45:02.972 --> 45:07.295
moreover, till I tell you, please don’t open your eyes.

45:10.206 --> 45:16.554
Now close your eyes, slowly, not with pressure, but slowly, delicately.

45:17.543 --> 45:21.039
Now, don’t worry about where your thoughts are,

45:21.108 --> 45:23.199
what you have to do, concentrate, nothing.

45:23.277 --> 45:26.563
Kundalini will do all the job. You just leave it alone.

45:36.914 --> 45:42.518
Now here is the centre of your Spirit,

45:45.226 --> 45:50.635
so here you have to ask a fundamental question about yourself to me.

45:50.666 --> 45:54.806
You can call me Mother or you can call me Shri Mataji.

45:54.876 --> 45:57.976
So please ask a question,

45:58.067 --> 46:03.460
“Mother, am I the Spirit?”

46:03.481 --> 46:05.572
Please ask the question in your heart

46:05.601 --> 46:09.291
“Mother, am I the Spirit?” Three times!

46:17.831 --> 46:26.516
I have told you, that if you become the Spirit, you become your Master,

46:26.530 --> 46:30.760
because in the light of your Spirit, you know what is to be done.

46:30.831 --> 46:32.989
Your Spirit guides you.

46:34.485 --> 46:37.789
So now please take your right hand

46:37.797 --> 46:44.853
on the left-hand side of your abdomen in the upper part and press it.

46:44.862 --> 46:49.222
Here you ask me another question about yourself,

46:49.313 --> 46:52.202
three times in your heart,

46:52.282 --> 46:58.860
“Mother, am I my own Master?”

46:58.920 --> 47:03.260
“Mother, am I my own Master?”

47:15.458 --> 47:19.208
I have already told you, that I respect your freedom

47:19.228 --> 47:23.744
and this Pure Knowledge cannot be given to you,

47:23.804 --> 47:25.054
with force,

47:25.056 --> 47:27.027
so you have to ask for it.

47:28.527 --> 47:35.166
So please take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left hand side

47:35.175 --> 47:39.346
and ask six times,

47:39.405 --> 47:42.518
because this centre has got six petals.

47:45.438 --> 47:50.507
“Mother, please give me Pure Divine Knowledge.”

47:50.577 --> 47:56.052
You have to ask for it. I cannot force on you. Please ask six times.

48:05.981 --> 48:08.998
As soon as you ask for Pure Knowledge,

48:09.018 --> 48:11.411
the Kundalini starts rising

48:11.472 --> 48:13.572
like a plumule in a seed

48:13.652 --> 48:22.023
and is going upward now, so we have to help the higher chakras with our self confidence.

48:24.652 --> 48:26.536
So now please put your right hand

48:27.876 --> 48:31.643
in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side

48:31.677 --> 48:38.561
and here you have to say with full confidence,

48:40.161 --> 48:42.541
because this is the centre of your Mastery.

48:43.972 --> 48:47.858
“Mother, I am my own Master."

48:47.918 --> 48:55.018
Please say it ten times, “Mother, I am my own Master.”

49:07.072 --> 49:08.001
Now,

49:08.092 --> 49:13.731
please raise your right hand on the heart.

49:27.021 --> 49:31.884
I have already told you, that you are the Pure Spirit.

49:34.818 --> 49:38.297
You are not this body, this mind, these conditionings,

49:38.338 --> 49:41.494
this ego, these emotions,

49:41.521 --> 49:45.371
but you are the Pure Spirit.

49:45.371 --> 49:50.442
So now here you ask twelve times.

49:53.882 --> 49:57.626
You have to say with full confidence, twelve times

49:59.846 --> 50:02.916
“Mother, I am the Pure Spirit.”

50:04.858 --> 50:10.849
“Mother, I am the Pure Spirit.”

50:16.516 --> 50:18.614
I have already told you,

50:18.715 --> 50:21.005
that if you feel guilty

50:21.056 --> 50:23.364
and you don’t forgive yourself,

50:24.166 --> 50:30.021
you develop a problem for your left Vishuddhi,

50:30.010 --> 50:33.061
which is very dangerous for your health,

50:33.121 --> 50:35.771
as well as for your Self Realisation.

50:35.860 --> 50:39.579
So at this moment, you have to forgive yourself fully.

50:41.130 --> 50:49.666
So now raise your right hand in the left corner of your neck and shoulder

50:49.677 --> 50:53.597
and put your head to your right.

50:55.556 --> 51:01.914
Here you have to say sixteen times, with full confidence in yourself.

51:01.918 --> 51:08.043
“Mother, I am not guilty at all.” Please say it sixteen times.

51:08.047 --> 51:11.967
Have faith in yourself, just say I tell you are not guilty,

51:12.047 --> 51:15.217
you are human beings and human beings can commit mistakes.

51:15.288 --> 51:20.748
You are not gods, so please say it with full confidence sixteen times.

51:25.900 --> 51:29.753
Most intricate part is that,

51:29.764 --> 51:35.463
you have to forgive every one without thinking about them, in general.

51:37.094 --> 51:38.215
If you don’t forgive,

51:38.206 --> 51:41.456
then this chakra will be completely constricted

51:41.525 --> 51:43.766
and the Kundalini won’t rise.

51:44.326 --> 51:48.806
All your life you have tortured yourself, by not forgiving others

51:48.864 --> 51:54.315
and now at this moment, if you don’t forgive this centre won’t open at all,

51:54.364 --> 51:57.476
so you will miss again your Self Realisation.

51:57.545 --> 52:01.652
You have to ask forgiveness from this All-Pervading Power,

52:01.731 --> 52:03.681
just for your satisfaction.

52:04.442 --> 52:06.871
Don’t count your mistakes please.

52:07.851 --> 52:11.751
Don’t feel guilty in any way.

52:11.780 --> 52:15.231
Now put your right hand on the back side of your head

52:15.239 --> 52:18.331
and push back your head as far as possible

52:21.001 --> 52:22.726
and here you have to say,

52:27.315 --> 52:36.239
“Oh Divine Power, if I have done anything knowingly or unknowingly,

52:38.369 --> 52:43.244
something that is wrong, please forgive me.”

52:43.253 --> 52:45.847
This also you have to say from your heart,

52:45.842 --> 52:51.333
not how many times counting or anything, but from your heart you have to say.

53:01.830 --> 53:04.746
Some people find it difficult to forgive themselves

53:04.766 --> 53:09.275
and some people find it difficult to forgive others.

53:19.626 --> 53:22.637
Now stretch your palm

53:22.688 --> 53:29.505
fully, put the centre of your palm on top of your fontanel bone area

53:30.376 --> 53:33.405
and push back your fingers.

53:37.666 --> 53:39.896
Now, please bend your head.

53:41.407 --> 53:45.956
Again at this centre, I cannot force Self-Realisation on you.

53:46.007 --> 53:48.487
You have ask for it.

53:48.509 --> 53:51.958
So, please move you hands seven times.

53:52.047 --> 53:55.467
Please put down your head. Please put down your head.

53:55.478 --> 54:01.599
Please move your scalp with your hand,

54:01.601 --> 54:04.487
with a pressure, because you have pushed back your fingers,

54:04.472 --> 54:09.007
seven times, slowly, clock wise, saying,

54:09.916 --> 54:12.376
“Mother, please give me Self Realisation.”

54:13.878 --> 54:15.757
You have to say it,

54:15.768 --> 54:21.088
unless or until you ask for it, I cannot force it on you, so please say it.

55:09.476 --> 55:13.076
Now please take down your hands.

55:13.155 --> 55:16.045
Please open your eyes, slowly.

55:21.989 --> 55:24.661
Put both the hands towards me, like this.

55:27.690 --> 55:29.811
Now

55:33.487 --> 55:36.773
put your right hand towards me like this

55:36.833 --> 55:42.362
and with the left hand, you bend your head and see for yourself,

55:42.431 --> 55:48.202
if there is cool or a hot breeze coming out of your head.

55:50.793 --> 55:53.556
Could be hot if you have not forgiven.

55:53.617 --> 55:56.327
Don’t put the hand on top of your head.

55:56.327 --> 55:59.389
So away from it and move your hand.

55:59.396 --> 56:03.978
Sometimes it can be very close, or it can be far away.

56:03.978 --> 56:11.027
So please bend your head and see for yourself if there is a cool, or a hot breeze like sensation

56:11.097 --> 56:14.893
coming from the fontanel bone area and don’t doubt.

56:14.922 --> 56:17.563
May be you might think it’s air conditioning and all that,

56:17.632 --> 56:19.612
but there is no air conditioning in your head.

56:19.632 --> 56:21.972
So, see it if for yourself, nicely.

56:22.713 --> 56:24.498
Now,

56:24.501 --> 56:28.681
please put your left hand towards me and put the right hand... now

56:28.739 --> 56:33.947
you see if there is cool breeze or a hot breeze like sensation,

56:33.960 --> 56:36.577
coming out of your head.

56:36.603 --> 56:37.938
Now,

56:37.931 --> 56:43.181
turn your hand on all the sides.

56:43.273 --> 56:46.489
You can also see if some people get it very far.

56:46.512 --> 56:49.032
Some people get it like a jet out.

56:49.103 --> 56:54.012
Some it is closer to the head. It depends on the personality of a person.

56:55.603 --> 56:57.793
Alright. Now have another one,

56:57.893 --> 57:02.666
right one, right hand last, lastly.

57:02.755 --> 57:05.965
Please put your left hand now, bend your head

57:05.965 --> 57:12.014
and see for yourself, there is a cool or a hot breeze coming out of your head.

57:13.873 --> 57:18.443
It’s little further also you can see clearly, if there is.

57:20.349 --> 57:21.534
Now,

57:25.364 --> 57:29.255
please put both the hands towards the sky

57:29.315 --> 57:36.860
and push back your head and here you have to ask a question.

57:37.010 --> 57:41.141
Any one of these questions, you can ask three times.

57:41.260 --> 57:48.639
The first question is, you can say is, “Is this the All-Pervading Power of Divine Love?”

57:48.777 --> 57:53.599
“Mother, is this is the All-Pervading Power of Divine Love?”

57:54.500 --> 57:57.110
Second question could be,

57:58.018 --> 58:01.829
“Is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?”

58:01.880 --> 58:06.889
Third question could be, “Mother is this the Brahma Chaitanya?”

58:06.898 --> 58:11.059
Ask any one of these questions three times.

58:16.485 --> 58:18.510
Now bring down the hands

58:20.400 --> 58:24.250
and put both the hands towards me and watch me without thinking.

58:33.396 --> 58:38.737
All those who have felt cool or hot breeze on their fingertips,

58:38.817 --> 58:40.739
or on their palms,

58:40.838 --> 58:46.039
or out of their fontanel bone area, which was a soft bone in childhood,

58:46.047 --> 58:49.478
please raise both your hands.

58:54.826 --> 58:56.635
Every one of you!

58:56.706 --> 59:00.590
May God bless you Sydney people. I am so happy.

59:00.661 --> 59:02.501
May God bless you.

59:03.400 --> 59:04.916
Now keep it up.

59:04.920 --> 59:09.471
You have to come to the collective and keep it up, and know the knowledge, all of it.

59:09.570 --> 59:10.800
Can I see this side?

59:10.860 --> 59:12.860
All of you got it?

59:12.931 --> 59:15.380
Oh my God!

59:18.010 --> 59:18.981
It’s remarkable.

59:19.041 --> 59:20.684
This side also?

59:23.271 --> 59:26.989
It’s really remarkable. May God bless you.

59:27.369 --> 59:28.710
It’s tremendous.

59:28.780 --> 59:31.226
Some didn’t get, very, very few.

59:31.326 --> 59:35.614
One here, one there,

59:35.675 --> 59:42.697
so they can also come later on, on the stage and Sahaja Yogis will give them Realisation.

59:42.788 --> 59:47.157
No problem, but we will have one song just before I leave.

59:47.268 --> 59:49.538
I hope you will keep sitting till then

59:49.617 --> 59:53.262
and you can also clap, so your hands become more active.

59:53.262 --> 59:59.983
Some song that will give you nice clapping rhythm, which one?

01:00:37.025 --> 01:00:38.510
You put your hand like this.

01:00:38.570 --> 01:00:42.480
It will increase with the songs. You'll feel the Cool Breeze increase with the songs.

01:00:58.869 --> 01:01:01.179
Now just feel your vibrations

01:01:01.289 --> 01:01:05.585
just feel with this clapping, how they have improved or not.

01:01:08.849 --> 01:01:09.795
Alright!

01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:12.786
It's much better, the flow.

01:01:12.775 --> 01:01:16.706
Also you can see on your head, you're much better.

01:01:16.726 --> 01:01:21.326
As the lady had seen, the one described by Lord Mayor,

01:01:21.416 --> 01:01:24.021
you can see on other's head also,

01:01:24.045 --> 01:01:25.371
if it is there or not.

01:01:25.358 --> 01:01:27.902
With the neighbours you can see

01:01:27.918 --> 01:01:30.068
It's there.

01:01:31.608 --> 01:01:35.393
Not on top, here little.

01:01:37.804 --> 01:01:38.753
It’s open now.
