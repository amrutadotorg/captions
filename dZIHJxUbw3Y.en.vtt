00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.954
I bow to all the Seekers of Truth

00:00:24.888 --> 00:00:30.321
I'm very thankful to Mr Henry Tsang,

00:00:30.323 --> 00:00:35.542
for addressing you and introducing me to you,

00:00:35.564 --> 00:00:37.341
that’s very kind of him.

00:00:37.341 --> 00:00:46.024
It is the one the very rare occasions, where I have seen people in authority have understood my work

00:00:46.094 --> 00:00:47.625
and have tried to help me.

00:00:47.673 --> 00:00:51.978
Whatever he said is really very remarkable,

00:00:52.048 --> 00:01:01.387
that all these greater people like Lao-Tse, who started Taoism,

00:01:01.457 --> 00:01:05.349
Buddha, who was teaching Buddhism,

00:01:05.361 --> 00:01:15.551
all of them talked about the oneness of Human Being with the nature.

00:01:15.545 --> 00:01:19.521
And if you cannot combine nature with yourself,

00:01:19.533 --> 00:01:24.152
then you cannot be called as an evolved soul.

00:01:24.212 --> 00:01:34.521
In that thing I was telling him about Yangtze river where he comes from same state Yangtze.

00:01:34.563 --> 00:01:39.212
That Yangtze river I travelled through with my husband

00:01:39.271 --> 00:01:44.739
and it’s the one Lao-Tse has used

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:47.819
for describing a human ascent.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:54.102
It’s a river which goes in different angles and makes lots of currents and it's very dangerous

00:01:54.194 --> 00:01:55.614
to ply through that,

00:01:55.664 --> 00:02:03.060
but they are having an... now a tourist arrangement to go through that

00:02:03.072 --> 00:02:07.462
and my husband as he was in the marine time, they invited us to see them.

00:02:07.471 --> 00:02:14.800
So in that the message was that, you see, you are passing through a very beautiful land.

00:02:14.853 --> 00:02:20.185
You see across the banks, beautiful trees

00:02:20.235 --> 00:02:25.735
and very beautiful mountains, which you see in the paintings of Chinese.

00:02:25.805 --> 00:02:27.625
They are really like that,

00:02:27.795 --> 00:02:30.045
but you should not get lost.

00:02:30.103 --> 00:02:38.466
You have to go further, you can watch these.. all these beautiful scenes,

00:02:38.485 --> 00:02:43.843
sit down there, enjoy yourself, but still you have to go with the stream.

00:02:43.905 --> 00:02:49.060
And then you go further and further, it's described it very well in his Tao.

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:56.408
Tao means 'that it is' and it started showing such beautiful scenes

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:01.395
sometimes that I really felt that I should get out of the boat and sit down there.

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:06.669
But he was meaning that in your meditation when you are moving,

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:14.335
you should not get tempted by this outward fascination of nature also

00:03:14.335 --> 00:03:19.252
but you enjoy, be one with it, you just see it, enjoy it

00:03:19.245 --> 00:03:27.901
and then he says that the river flows closer to the sea, that is the ultimate aim of the river,

00:03:27.901 --> 00:03:31.157
then she becomes absolutely silent

00:03:31.161 --> 00:03:36.966
and she spreads out and then gradually she moves towards the sea.

00:03:36.966 --> 00:03:39.252
It’s such a beautiful description

00:03:39.331 --> 00:03:45.348
and I have seen it myself and I can understand the poet, how he wanted to communicate,

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:50.610
that how the nature should teach us, how to be meditative within ourselves.

00:03:51.899 --> 00:03:54.990
Buddha always talked about the Central Path

00:03:55.079 --> 00:04:01.497
and also he always said that our character is the mainstay.

00:04:01.586 --> 00:04:07.709
If you don’t have good character, then it is very difficult to ascend.

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:10.770
These were the days when really this was the position.

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:25.610
In India there were horrible, cruel kings and then they were killing people just for land or something.

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:33.249
This was so much in India,

00:04:33.319 --> 00:04:39.879
that Buddha if he had not come it would have not stopped

00:04:39.869 --> 00:04:44.430
and gradually when the awakening came within them,

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.730
that this is something wrong they are doing.

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:51.269
They should not kill human beings for just getting some land.

00:04:51.278 --> 00:04:53.206
What is the use of this thing?

00:04:54.850 --> 00:05:00.692
Ultimately one king, saw the blood flowing through one river

00:05:00.713 --> 00:05:06.283
and he got such a repentance about what he had done,

00:05:06.382 --> 00:05:10.937
that he went to Buddha and told him that, "Sir please save me,

00:05:10.997 --> 00:05:18.161
I am very guilty about what I have been doing and I don’t think I can live any longer with this guilt."

00:05:18.151 --> 00:05:22.918
So Buddha pacified him and he became a Buddhist.

00:05:22.918 --> 00:05:31.430
Now in Sahaja Yoga we have a way by which we become one with reality,

00:05:31.423 --> 00:05:36.180
one with this All-Pervading Power.

00:05:36.278 --> 00:05:39.487
So the first point, if is the truth, is this,

00:05:39.557 --> 00:05:43.617
that you are not this body, this mind,

00:05:43.627 --> 00:05:48.218
or this ego or your conditionings,

00:05:48.298 --> 00:05:51.869
but what you are, you are a pure Spirit,

00:05:51.869 --> 00:05:57.028
which is said by Christ, said by all these great prophets. Everybody has said that

00:05:58.627 --> 00:06:05.708
and then second truth is that there is an All-Pervading Power of Divine Love.

00:06:05.718 --> 00:06:10.766
You see the flowers of Sydney, so beautiful, one better than the other.

00:06:10.793 --> 00:06:13.923
And see how they have grown.

00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:17.228
We never think that there is something miracle about them.

00:06:17.927 --> 00:06:23.014
It is a miracle, the way they have grown out of the Mother Earth with such a beauty.

00:06:23.028 --> 00:06:27.384
After all we cannot do that.

00:06:27.398 --> 00:06:34.324
Mother Earth has done it and we take all those living works for granted.

00:06:34.326 --> 00:06:37.576
We don’t even think who runs our heart.

00:06:37.658 --> 00:06:41.098
We don’t even think who digests our food.

00:06:41.028 --> 00:06:44.502
What is that energy which does all these things,

00:06:44.562 --> 00:06:50.415
which controls our heights and everything else that is living?

00:06:50.423 --> 00:06:55.257
So there is a power of All-Pervading Love

00:06:55.276 --> 00:07:01.175
and that is the one, which really has created us

00:07:01.175 --> 00:07:06.185
and that is the one, which is going to give us our Realisation.

00:07:06.254 --> 00:07:11.514
This energy that is within us is what we call as the Kundalini.

00:07:11.574 --> 00:07:13.403
He must have told you about it,

00:07:13.495 --> 00:07:16.935
is the reflection of this All-Pervading Power

00:07:16.925 --> 00:07:19.156
which is settled in our sacrum bone.

00:07:19.206 --> 00:07:26.735
Sacrum as you know is called ‘Sacred’ by the people who were Greeks.

00:07:26.725 --> 00:07:29.062
They were not Indians and they called this ‘Sacred Bone’.

00:07:29.132 --> 00:07:32.502
I asked the curator, “Why do you call it as sacrum?”

00:07:32.562 --> 00:07:37.324
He said “We were told it's a sacred bone and there is energy of the Mother inside it.”

00:07:37.384 --> 00:07:41.935
I was amazed that these Greeks knew about it.

00:07:41.944 --> 00:07:49.701
And it's so surprising, that for ancient times we knew about in India, about this energy that is within us,

00:07:49.706 --> 00:07:57.990
but somehow or other it was the tradition, not to talk about it or give Self-Realisation to people en masse.

00:07:58.050 --> 00:08:02.790
One teacher will have only one student.

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:05.290
One guru will have one disciple, that's all

00:08:05.382 --> 00:08:10.153
and he would just select one out of thousands and give Realisation to one

00:08:10.146 --> 00:08:12.963
and tell him the secret of Kundalini.

00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:18.004
It was going on for ages together till the 12th Century there was a big poet.

00:08:17.899 --> 00:08:29.545
We had a very great poet, who at the age of 31 years wrote tremendous secrets about spiritual life.

00:08:29.562 --> 00:08:32.764
I mean, it's unbelievable at this young age,

00:08:32.774 --> 00:08:35.676
because he died after that

00:08:35.744 --> 00:08:39.057
and then he is one who wrote in his book,

00:08:39.065 --> 00:08:44.815
after taking permission from his guru, that this Kundalini is one she does all the job.

00:08:44.835 --> 00:08:49.335
But people who were in charge of Hindu religion at the time, were just like priest every where.

00:08:49.413 --> 00:08:53.927
They said this chapter is no good, this is 'Nishidh.'

00:08:53.989 --> 00:08:58.192
We are not to deal with this. It is to be avoided.

00:08:58.187 --> 00:09:00.442
So nobody paid attention to that fact,

00:09:00.494 --> 00:09:04.244
but in the 16th century we had lots of poets in our country,

00:09:04.331 --> 00:09:07.272
who have sang the praise of this Kundalini.

00:09:07.322 --> 00:09:11.951
Also in Bible, there is that, “I will appear before you like tongues of flames.”

00:09:12.042 --> 00:09:15.091
And these chakras look like that,

00:09:15.041 --> 00:09:19.158
Inside, they are very mild tongues of flames.

00:09:19.173 --> 00:09:25.014
So all these things though little bit described in the Bible, described in the Koran, everywhere,

00:09:25.076 --> 00:09:32.365
but there was no proper, intelligible knowledge about Kundalini I would say,

00:09:32.446 --> 00:09:41.094
though in India they had. There was a kind of a

00:09:41.081 --> 00:09:47.000
you can call religious experiments which were called as NathPanthis.

00:09:47.052 --> 00:09:51.490
These people are the same who had only one disciple,

00:09:51.538 --> 00:09:56.051
one guru sort of thing, but later on it just spread out

00:09:56.100 --> 00:10:01.364
and we had lots of people in the 16th century who started talking about Kundalini

00:10:01.365 --> 00:10:08.907
and saying about it. So that’s how we have this knowledge in that county since long.

00:10:08.985 --> 00:10:14.657
But after the British came, it all became nonsense and nobody bothered for 300 hundred years

00:10:14.735 --> 00:10:22.181
and all this knowledge has gone into kind of a cupboard from where it came out.

00:10:22.211 --> 00:10:27.711
Now, I knew about it myself, but I wanted to find out a method

00:10:27.719 --> 00:10:33.019
by which we could give Realisation en masse, not to one person.

00:10:33.139 --> 00:10:41.062
If you give to one person, everybody will get after him, or crucify him, or kill him, or give poison or get out.

00:10:42.379 --> 00:10:49.240
Now the time also has come, this is the time that we say in the Bible is the judgement,

00:10:49.259 --> 00:10:51.283
the Last Judgement,

00:10:51.293 --> 00:10:57.490
but in Koran it's very clearly written. See how all the truths are the same everywhere.

00:10:57.519 --> 00:11:03.182
The Koran it is written that at this time, which they call Qiyamah, the Resurrection Time,

00:11:03.243 --> 00:11:07.692
"Your hands will speak and they will give witness against you."

00:11:07.753 --> 00:11:12.812
So actually when you get your Realisation, you start feeling the energy in your hand

00:11:13.971 --> 00:11:17.211
and you can verify,

00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:22.941
you can verify what centres are catching and it’s tangible.

00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:28.090
As you know, that in Delhi there are three doctors who have already got MD

00:11:28.149 --> 00:11:32.312
for curing incurable diseases, through Sahaja Yoga.

00:11:32.322 --> 00:11:40.480
Now for diagnosis you don’t have to go in to that horrible, gruelling experience of diagnosis.

00:11:40.542 --> 00:11:43.392
Just you can feel it on your fingertips.

00:11:43.461 --> 00:11:45.908
You can know what's wrong with you

00:11:45.927 --> 00:11:52.490
and its absolutely curable. I tell you frankly, that definitely people have been cured of blood cancers.

00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:54.734
They have been cured about 9-10 years back.

00:11:54.822 --> 00:11:57.432
They are still living and they're quite hale and hearty.

00:11:57.494 --> 00:12:05.721
We have seen that people who are suffering from all kinds of incurable diseases are cured,

00:12:05.791 --> 00:12:10.091
but they have to enter into a new state of awareness

00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:13.341
that is what we call is the Sahaja Yoga state,

00:12:13.421 --> 00:12:16.490
where you become one with this Divine Power.

00:12:16.581 --> 00:12:19.480
Then this power starts flowing through you.

00:12:21.096 --> 00:12:24.296
Most of the world’s problems, if you see come from human beings

00:12:24.346 --> 00:12:29.278
not from nature, more from human beings and the nature reacts to it.

00:12:30.495 --> 00:12:34.163
Now when you get these problems

00:12:34.163 --> 00:12:38.413
you start running about here and there and trying to find out solutions.

00:12:38.423 --> 00:12:41.322
The solution is within.

00:12:41.341 --> 00:12:45.817
Within our centres, when these centres are in jeopardy,

00:12:45.865 --> 00:12:49.388
you get all these physical, mental, emotional problems

00:12:49.394 --> 00:12:52.336
for yourself and for the whole society, for the whole world.

00:12:53.711 --> 00:12:56.461
So now what should we do?

00:12:56.474 --> 00:13:03.860
Is to correct these centres by the awakening of this Kundalini, which passes through six centres.

00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:05.870
These centres get enlightened

00:13:05.951 --> 00:13:11.777
and that enlightenment cures them, nourishes them and integrates them.

00:13:11.791 --> 00:13:17.176
Then you are completely one with this All-Pervading Power

00:13:17.264 --> 00:13:20.663
and the correction becomes permanent.

00:13:20.734 --> 00:13:26.625
At that time they say that it starts flowing through you, you can feel it on your fingertips

00:13:26.657 --> 00:13:31.171
and by that you develop all your potential powers which are so many,

00:13:31.221 --> 00:13:34.801
so many that in this small lecture I may not be able to tell you the whole,

00:13:34.850 --> 00:13:37.591
but some of them I will be able to tell you,

00:13:37.639 --> 00:13:41.923
that the first thing happens to you that you achieve a state of peace.

00:13:43.085 --> 00:13:47.860
You are thinking of tomorrow, or of yesterday past and future,

00:13:47.932 --> 00:13:49.500
but present we are not there.

00:13:49.532 --> 00:13:54.586
Present is not known to us

00:13:54.697 --> 00:13:56.899
and reality is in the present.

00:13:56.956 --> 00:14:02.889
So when you are thinking of the past and future, you are jumping on the cusp of those thoughts.

00:14:02.951 --> 00:14:07.399
In between these thoughts, there is space which we call as Vilamba in Sanskrit,

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:09.451
is 'the pause'.

00:14:09.528 --> 00:14:14.668
and that is the time when you are in present, which is very short

00:14:14.677 --> 00:14:17.370
and that’s why you can never be in the present.

00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:21.840
So, when the Kundalini rises, your attention is driven inside

00:14:21.850 --> 00:14:27.278
and these thoughts expand, in the sense that they elongate

00:14:27.298 --> 00:14:31.346
and there is the space in between is quite big.

00:14:31.418 --> 00:14:40.138
Thus you establish yourself into a new state and a new dimension of your awareness,

00:14:40.143 --> 00:14:43.604
which we call as Thoughtless Awareness.

00:14:43.618 --> 00:14:45.331
That is the meditation.

00:14:45.355 --> 00:14:49.474
You cannot do meditation you have to be in meditation,

00:14:49.488 --> 00:14:51.437
it's a state.

00:14:51.437 --> 00:14:54.903
Then there is no thought, but you are fully aware.

00:14:54.980 --> 00:15:00.369
Whatever you see is recorded like a picture in your mind

00:15:00.373 --> 00:15:04.163
and such tremendous changes take place in human beings,

00:15:04.221 --> 00:15:05.778
they are surprised.

00:15:05.788 --> 00:15:16.028
Like very ordinary person, who was playing once a instrument before me was very boring to begin with

00:15:16.042 --> 00:15:18.009
and suddenly I don’t know what happened to him.

00:15:18.061 --> 00:15:25.475
His Kundalini was awakened and he was playing such beautiful music and today he is a world famous man.

00:15:25.504 --> 00:15:28.798
There are very powerful Sahaja Yogis in the world now

00:15:28.898 --> 00:15:35.028
and I am so very happy that this has happened to people, that they have felt their own energy

00:15:35.076 --> 00:15:38.423
and they have felt their own peace.

00:15:38.423 --> 00:15:40.081
The second state that you achieve,

00:15:40.134 --> 00:15:43.701
what we call, this is the Thoughtless Awareness

00:15:43.783 --> 00:15:48.567
and the second one is called as the Doubtless Awareness.

00:15:48.638 --> 00:15:56.798
Patanjali in his yoga has said, called them, as Nirvichar Samadhi and Nirvikalap Samadhi.

00:15:57.682 --> 00:16:00.474
Now these two states if you have achieved,

00:16:00.533 --> 00:16:04.033
then all your powers you know what you have.

00:16:04.104 --> 00:16:05.822
You know all your inner being.

00:16:05.884 --> 00:16:13.556
You know your chakras and you know all the three... What should I say? The Autonomous Nervous System.

00:16:13.783 --> 00:16:17.254
like para-sympathetic, sympathetic systems, everything you know

00:16:17.312 --> 00:16:21.494
and you know how to control them, how to improve them, how to work them out.

00:16:23.283 --> 00:16:25.604
So you become your own master.

00:16:27.009 --> 00:16:33.123
Firstly when you are awakened, firstly what you get is all your talents.

00:16:33.182 --> 00:16:35.942
For example: I see Australians are great artists.

00:16:36.003 --> 00:16:41.176
I have seen people who have come to Sahaja Yoga become such deep artist

00:16:41.195 --> 00:16:44.975
and such beautiful artist, aesthetically so rich.

00:16:45.125 --> 00:16:50.230
It is because whatever you know is very little

00:16:50.245 --> 00:16:55.638
and the whole dynamism of your creativity just explodes

00:16:55.725 --> 00:16:58.898
and you start producing things which are very soothing,

00:16:58.947 --> 00:17:05.727
which are very beautiful, which makes every one so happy.

00:17:05.721 --> 00:17:11.537
It’s not some sort of nonsensical thing you do some queer thing just to please the people

00:17:11.547 --> 00:17:15.336
and show off that you are a great designer and this and that.

00:17:15.355 --> 00:17:16.766
No.

00:17:16.826 --> 00:17:23.432
You do it natural, honest reproduction of what you feel

00:17:23.451 --> 00:17:29.824
and that feeling is absolutely divine and thus you produce really classical, beautiful things,

00:17:29.894 --> 00:17:35.788
which is very surprising how these modern children have taken to it.

00:17:35.788 --> 00:17:41.441
Normally the Modern Art, as you know is mostly understood by the artist himself.

00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:47.355
Nobody else can understand it, because they just go mad and do all kinds of things.

00:17:47.365 --> 00:17:49.596
In this also you may do Modern Art,

00:17:49.605 --> 00:17:53.509
means in the sense that you break all the lines and everything,

00:17:53.509 --> 00:17:59.423
but, what you find that whatever you do is extremely soothing

00:17:59.423 --> 00:18:03.056
and natural, one with the nature

00:18:03.125 --> 00:18:08.557
and anybody who sees that will say, "Who has made this sort of

00:18:08.548 --> 00:18:12.048
an expression of the true feeling from within;

00:18:12.152 --> 00:18:16.028
nothing artificial, nothing vulgar, nothing nonsensical."

00:18:16.903 --> 00:18:20.911
In the same way musicians and other things in every art...

00:18:20.932 --> 00:18:24.778
I was, I have been really amazed how Sahaja Yoga has helped.

00:18:24.846 --> 00:18:31.144
I have seen this Sydney Sahaja Yogis singing to you this Marathi and Sanskrit songs and Hindi songs,

00:18:31.142 --> 00:18:33.711
which not even Indians can sing.

00:18:33.778 --> 00:18:34.922
They cannot sing so well,

00:18:34.971 --> 00:18:39.894
I mean if you hear them from outside, nobody will know they are people from Australia.

00:18:39.913 --> 00:18:43.471
They are Australians, as if some Indians are singing it's very difficult.

00:18:43.574 --> 00:18:48.663
Indian singing is extremely difficult, people practice for years together to achieve this.

00:18:48.769 --> 00:18:53.009
Not only that they know it, but also so many of them know it by heart

00:18:53.009 --> 00:18:57.298
and I don’t know how they have picked it up, this I just don’t understand.

00:18:57.313 --> 00:18:58.913
Then they come and sing in India.

00:18:58.971 --> 00:19:03.240
Even so many artists have said, "Now we are ashamed, the way these people are doing

00:19:03.269 --> 00:19:06.144
At such a young age, how they have picked it so well.

00:19:06.198 --> 00:19:08.875
They sing in such beautiful unison."

00:19:08.894 --> 00:19:10.894
All these things happen to you.

00:19:10.913 --> 00:19:14.682
Secondly it happens, that so-called religions that you have, you follow.

00:19:14.663 --> 00:19:20.698
Somebody will say, "I'm a Buddhist." Somebody will say, "I am a Christian, I am Hindu, Muslim," anything.

00:19:20.748 --> 00:19:23.875
They can commit any sins, it's outward.

00:19:23.872 --> 00:19:25.269
It's just a label.

00:19:25.259 --> 00:19:29.652
Like one girl met me and she was saying, "I am born again." I said, "You are not.

00:19:29.672 --> 00:19:33.451
You just label yourself as 'Born Again', you are not.

00:19:33.467 --> 00:19:37.317
Unless and until you get your realisation, you cannot be born again

00:19:37.423 --> 00:19:42.797
and once you are born again, you get the quality of a personality who is a born again

00:19:42.788 --> 00:19:46.557
has so many powers, so compassionate, so peaceful.

00:19:46.583 --> 00:19:49.247
"You are not." I said, "You are in a delusion."

00:19:49.257 --> 00:19:52.384
She asked me, "Are you born again?" I said, "I am, of course I am

00:19:52.326 --> 00:19:54.855
and you can be also if you want to,

00:19:54.913 --> 00:19:58.364
but if you want to carry on with artificial levels, what can you do?

00:19:58.394 --> 00:20:00.776
what good have they done to anyone?"

00:20:01.692 --> 00:20:08.567
So the artificiality drops out and your real personality starts expressing itself.

00:20:08.548 --> 00:20:13.028
As far as the religion is concerned, you become absolutely righteous.

00:20:14.778 --> 00:20:17.067
The other day, I was reading about the genes

00:20:17.125 --> 00:20:19.912
and I was amazed to hear that the

00:20:19.913 --> 00:20:23.171
Asians have two genes to protect them,

00:20:23.171 --> 00:20:25.365
but the Western people have none.

00:20:26.096 --> 00:20:29.346
Now, the two genes that are within us,

00:20:29.423 --> 00:20:33.865
one is, I would say, comes from the mother,

00:20:33.875 --> 00:20:37.008
may be the father, or the society, or whatever it is,

00:20:37.748 --> 00:20:43.395
but one we call in Sahaja Yoga, 'sin against the Mother' and 'sin against the Father',

00:20:43.413 --> 00:20:45.806
out of which the left side,

00:20:45.836 --> 00:20:50.027
when we are there, we are sinning against the Mother,

00:20:50.105 --> 00:20:52.987
means we become immoral.

00:20:52.987 --> 00:20:55.923
We don’t know what is morality.

00:20:55.932 --> 00:20:59.576
We start playing with things, which we should not.

00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:05.373
Then we get into trouble, we get diseases, this, that, all sorts of problems,

00:21:05.432 --> 00:21:07.545
because there is no protection.

00:21:07.596 --> 00:21:09.333
So we are very vulnerable.

00:21:10.009 --> 00:21:13.221
All kinds of indulgences and all kinds of habits,

00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:17.913
that we form, which are self-destructive, is sin against the Mother.

00:21:18.423 --> 00:21:26.557
The another gene, is the one that protects you against, the sin against the Father

00:21:26.615 --> 00:21:31.134
and sin against the Father, is to be dishonest,

00:21:31.237 --> 00:21:34.836
to be corrupt, not to believe that God is your Father.

00:21:34.826 --> 00:21:36.403
Why should we do all this thing?

00:21:36.457 --> 00:21:39.961
So this kind of a sin also, we start doing.

00:21:39.977 --> 00:21:43.094
Both these genes that are protective,

00:21:43.163 --> 00:21:46.218
are created after Sahaja Yoga within you

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:47.913
and you just don’t do wrong things.

00:21:47.923 --> 00:21:50.688
I have seen people from West, how they were.

00:21:50.701 --> 00:21:52.807
They give up all kinds of nonsense.

00:21:52.817 --> 00:21:56.720
We never have the problem of somebody's wife running away with somebody,

00:21:56.730 --> 00:21:58.825
somebody's daughter running away with somebody.

00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:01.740
Some rape and all that, it's out of question.

00:22:01.730 --> 00:22:04.682
We have thousands and thousands of Sahaja Yogis

00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:07.169
and they come together many a times.

00:22:07.199 --> 00:22:11.865
I have never seen them quarrelling, fighting have any violence or anything.

00:22:11.894 --> 00:22:14.788
So this, the sin against the Father and sin against the Mother,

00:22:14.846 --> 00:22:19.778
just is sort of established, that they just don’t do it.

00:22:19.942 --> 00:22:23.123
They dress up properly. They live properly. They don’t take to drugs.

00:22:23.182 --> 00:22:25.297
They don’t take all these things.

00:22:25.333 --> 00:22:34.535
Now you know the progeny, how it is facing the effects of this modern life.

00:22:34.536 --> 00:22:38.736
Like you see, the children are left to dogs,

00:22:38.817 --> 00:22:40.281
they become so horrible.

00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:43.560
I have seen in Miami with my own eyes,

00:22:43.582 --> 00:22:47.567
children who were only 12 years of age, were carrying revolvers

00:22:47.556 --> 00:22:49.067
and were selling drugs,

00:22:49.125 --> 00:22:54.365
because the law is such, that they do not punish 12 years old children in the jail,

00:22:54.384 --> 00:22:59.086
so people are taking advantage of these children and they are behaving like this.

00:22:59.093 --> 00:23:01.368
There are children who are killing their parents.

00:23:01.410 --> 00:23:03.549
There are parents who are killing their children.

00:23:03.559 --> 00:23:07.500
This kind of a violence is the sin against the Father.

00:23:07.509 --> 00:23:12.798
So both ways you see, if there is sort of an attack.

00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:15.605
What will happen to such a society?

00:23:15.624 --> 00:23:18.478
Is important one has to take to spiritual life

00:23:18.538 --> 00:23:21.121
and the spiritual life of not outside,

00:23:21.181 --> 00:23:27.431
that you just go to church, sing some hymn numbers, this and that and come home.

00:23:27.461 --> 00:23:30.548
This is not that, it has to be innate, within yourself.

00:23:30.625 --> 00:23:31.804
You have to be honest.

00:23:31.932 --> 00:23:34.182
You have to be integrated with yourself

00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:42.044
and then this innate religion will tell you, that you belong to the religion, which is a universal religion,

00:23:42.124 --> 00:23:45.000
which encompasses all the religions,

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:50.517
which respects all the great incarnations, all the prophets, every one.

00:23:51.182 --> 00:23:57.518
Every religion is a flower on the tree of life,

00:23:57.586 --> 00:23:59.336
of spirituality,

00:23:59.403 --> 00:24:02.288
but you have taken away that flower

00:24:02.278 --> 00:24:05.198
and you are fighting with the dead flower. "This is mine." "This is mine."

00:24:05.258 --> 00:24:09.296
You have no claims and is the dead flower which is now petrified

00:24:09.403 --> 00:24:12.846
and that’s how you see in every religion what problems are coming.

00:24:12.913 --> 00:24:17.855
How people are suffering. How they are fighting. All kinds of things happen.

00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:22.298
So people become, they say, "We don’t believe in God."

00:24:22.326 --> 00:24:23.865
They become atheist.

00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:26.574
When they become atheist also, they are doing the wrong thing

00:24:26.576 --> 00:24:30.490
and those who believe in God, in such a way, are also wrong.

00:24:30.519 --> 00:24:32.361
It’s a blind faith.

00:24:32.351 --> 00:24:36.298
With Sahaja Yoga, I must tell you one thing, you shouldn’t have blind faith.

00:24:36.911 --> 00:24:40.480
If you feel the experience of Realisation,

00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:45.769
then of course, as honest people, you must accept, respect it and go-ahead with it and grow.

00:24:45.817 --> 00:24:50.286
But if you don’t feel the experience, you shouldn’t tell lies.

00:24:50.346 --> 00:24:54.246
You should come again and again. See that you get your Realisation.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.699
There are so many things, as I told you, I could tell you,

00:24:57.769 --> 00:25:01.721
but only the attention part I have told you, that attention gets enlightened

00:25:01.749 --> 00:25:04.429
and wherever you put your attention it works.

00:25:04.509 --> 00:25:06.884
It helps.

00:25:06.894 --> 00:25:10.134
So in a way you start living collectively.

00:25:10.228 --> 00:25:14.980
You start feeling that you are part and parcel of one whole being.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.402
The microcosm becomes the macrocosm,

00:25:17.392 --> 00:25:19.582
a drops becomes the ocean

00:25:19.662 --> 00:25:22.250
and that’s how the whole world can become one,

00:25:22.304 --> 00:25:25.814
one day and all these problems and things will go away,

00:25:25.884 --> 00:25:28.701
because through Sahaja Yoga you know Absolute Truth.

00:25:28.769 --> 00:25:31.814
Everybody knows the same truth, no quarrel,

00:25:31.883 --> 00:25:34.921
as you are watching me, I am sitting down here.

00:25:34.932 --> 00:25:38.288
All of you feel the same about everything.

00:25:38.298 --> 00:25:42.394
So there are no discussions, no arguments, no fighting, nothing

00:25:42.423 --> 00:25:45.134
and you really become a peaceful personality.

00:25:45.211 --> 00:25:47.750
You emit peace, as I told you.

00:25:49.942 --> 00:25:51.788
So,

00:25:51.788 --> 00:25:56.930
the highest thing is that you enter into to the Kingdom of God.

00:25:57.009 --> 00:26:02.053
Somebody told me today, “Mother, they... people don’t know what is Kingdom of God.”

00:26:02.104 --> 00:26:04.692
So I said, “They have to enter in to see."

00:26:04.846 --> 00:26:09.727
Unless and until I enter into this hall, how will I know what this hall is like.

00:26:09.777 --> 00:26:16.701
So once they enter into it, they write to me, that Mother we are now in the Kingdom of God,

00:26:16.711 --> 00:26:21.344
because you start... drowned into,

00:26:21.509 --> 00:26:25.188
you feel you are drowned into the ocean of joy

00:26:25.238 --> 00:26:29.596
and joy is not double like happiness and unhappiness.

00:26:29.653 --> 00:26:35.018
Supposing you have... your ego is pampered.

00:26:35.076 --> 00:26:38.836
You feel very happy, that I am such and such, I have got this

00:26:38.942 --> 00:26:41.977
and if any is punctured you feel unhappy,

00:26:42.027 --> 00:26:47.006
but joy is singular, it's in that state, from where you witness your life.

00:26:47.006 --> 00:26:51.451
In a one lecture, program, I don’t think I will able tell you all about it.

00:26:51.526 --> 00:26:57.393
I must have given at least four thousand lectures in only English language.

00:26:57.403 --> 00:27:03.288
So I have to tell you one thing, that today whatever is happening in Sahaja Yoga

00:27:03.288 --> 00:27:06.548
is the culmination of your evolution,

00:27:06.605 --> 00:27:10.105
culmination of all spiritual work,

00:27:10.153 --> 00:27:14.515
that people have done, all the saints, prophets and incarnations

00:27:14.525 --> 00:27:21.365
and is the last judgement for you, so that you enter into the Kingdom of God.

00:27:21.393 --> 00:27:24.086
Sahaja means ‘born with you’.

00:27:24.113 --> 00:27:26.971
‘Saha’ is ‘with’. ‘Ja’ is ‘born’

00:27:27.063 --> 00:27:30.201
Born with you is the right

00:27:30.256 --> 00:27:35.316
to become united, which means yoga, with this All-Pervading Power.

00:27:35.384 --> 00:27:37.823
It is your birthright,

00:27:37.836 --> 00:27:39.692
because you are born at this time

00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:41.756
and this should happen,

00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:46.413
but after that please remember, that you might feel very great about it

00:27:46.476 --> 00:27:51.266
and you may just enjoy it individually, but it’s not an individual growth.

00:27:51.326 --> 00:27:54.585
You have to come to our Centres.

00:27:54.605 --> 00:27:57.644
You don’t have to pay for it.

00:27:57.701 --> 00:28:01.365
Some people think that this is an introduction lecture so there's no payment.

00:28:01.355 --> 00:28:04.130
You can't pay for living thing. How can you pay?

00:28:04.179 --> 00:28:10.256
How can pay for the seed which is planted in the Mother Earth?

00:28:10.276 --> 00:28:14.604
How can you pay to the Mother Earth or to the seed? It’s all built in.

00:28:14.614 --> 00:28:16.064
In the same way it's built in to you.

00:28:16.134 --> 00:28:21.390
Of course for formally I use to come Australia with my own money and all that,

00:28:21.394 --> 00:28:25.728
but now we have so many Sahaja Yogis, that they want pay for my travel,

00:28:25.778 --> 00:28:31.438
may be for this hall they might have paid, but you don’t have to pay for your Self-Realisation

00:28:31.508 --> 00:28:35.307
and all the knowledge of your being, inner being,

00:28:35.375 --> 00:28:39.596
your powers and everything, for that you don’t have to pay.

00:28:39.669 --> 00:28:42.871
All these little expenses, which is very little,

00:28:42.941 --> 00:28:49.557
partly I should say, are taken over by so many Sahaja Yogis that you have.

00:28:49.621 --> 00:28:56.519
In Sydney itself, you have lots of Sahaja Yogis. They told me there are 22 centres in Sydney.

00:28:56.604 --> 00:29:02.940
So you all can take full advantage of it, but you must respect yourself,

00:29:02.942 --> 00:29:06.548
you must respect your Self-Realisation.

00:29:06.557 --> 00:29:09.903
After all, you must be something special to get it.

00:29:09.910 --> 00:29:11.740
So please don’t neglect it.

00:29:11.798 --> 00:29:15.652
There is no mesmerism to keep you attached to Sahaja Yoga.

00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:22.278
There is no other temptations, but one that you have to be one with this All-Pervading Power

00:29:22.362 --> 00:29:26.932
and this Kundalini is the pure desire, the power of pure desire.

00:29:26.968 --> 00:29:30.394
You are aware of if it, or you may not be aware of it,

00:29:30.498 --> 00:29:36.105
that you have only one pure desire is to be one with all this All-Pervading Power,

00:29:36.115 --> 00:29:42.728
because all other desires if you see, once they are fulfilled, they are of no importance to you.

00:29:42.798 --> 00:29:48.605
So it is said that, in general wants are not satiable.

00:29:48.615 --> 00:29:53.596
You never feel satisfied, but after this complete satisfaction comes in to you

00:29:53.644 --> 00:29:55.884
and you start enjoying everything,

00:29:55.967 --> 00:30:00.269
enjoying other people, enjoying your own relations,

00:30:00.364 --> 00:30:02.461
enjoying the whole world.

00:30:02.932 --> 00:30:07.913
This is such a blissful time, that you are born. Take full advantage of it

00:30:07.932 --> 00:30:11.401
and pay full attention to yourself

00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:16.076
and understand that just by labelling yourself as something, you do not become that.

00:30:16.086 --> 00:30:21.961
Do not fight for something that is artificial, but achieve something that is real.

00:30:22.053 --> 00:30:27.971
Thank you very much. I hope after one year again I will come back here and meet you.

00:30:28.083 --> 00:30:32.971
By that time all of you will grow up like big trees of spirituality,

00:30:33.019 --> 00:30:39.063
giving such vibrations and Realisation, that power you will have, that

00:30:39.133 --> 00:30:44.037
you can give Realisation, you can cure people, you can help people.

00:30:44.050 --> 00:30:49.038
Some people who have never been orators, have become great orators of Sahaja Yoga

00:30:49.015 --> 00:30:53.469
and all over the world you have brothers and sisters who are sincerely yours.

00:30:53.471 --> 00:30:54.489
May God Bless you.

00:30:54.499 --> 00:30:56.229
Thank you very much.

00:31:03.479 --> 00:31:05.038
I can't see the people.

00:31:08.785 --> 00:31:13.394
Can you ask them to put the light off, so that I can see the people.

00:31:20.996 --> 00:31:27.192
There is one thing more that I cannot force Self-Realisation on you.

00:31:27.266 --> 00:31:30.750
All of you can get it. Must just have confidence.

00:31:30.803 --> 00:31:35.990
All can get it, but if you don’t want to have it, I cannot force on you.

00:31:36.471 --> 00:31:37.875
I respect your freedom

00:31:38.951 --> 00:31:43.865
and I have to request people, if they don’t want to have it, they should leave the hall.

00:31:43.923 --> 00:31:50.025
That’s much better and otherwise I am sure it will work out for all of you.

00:31:54.336 --> 00:31:57.432
Can you ask them to reduce the light a little bit?

00:31:57.517 --> 00:31:59.673
Put the light, that side.

00:32:00.432 --> 00:32:01.653
It’s too much.

00:32:04.938 --> 00:32:08.278
Also reduce this one, it’s not too much light on me?

00:32:09.063 --> 00:32:11.083
Can’t see anyone.

00:32:28.942 --> 00:32:32.074
Till I give Realisation please reduce, this is too much.

00:32:32.884 --> 00:32:36.844
I never used to wear these glasses, but for these kind of things

00:32:42.192 --> 00:32:45.115
No, no, no these big things.

00:32:51.133 --> 00:32:52.779
I want to see them.

00:32:56.259 --> 00:32:59.403
We need to douse these overheads. Thank you.

00:33:02.596 --> 00:33:05.554
Ah, that proves one thing,

00:33:05.622 --> 00:33:09.827
that if you are blinded by something like that,

00:33:09.832 --> 00:33:13.250
you can not see anything else, you see, so one has to…

00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:25.200
So again, I would request those who want to go should leave,

00:33:25.278 --> 00:33:29.496
will be good idea. It takes 10-15 minutes, not more than that,

00:33:29.625 --> 00:33:32.605
but it's…

00:33:32.855 --> 00:33:40.256
You go beyond your mind. You just go on thinking about it, this, that, then it won’t work out …

00:33:47.375 --> 00:33:49.134
So nice!

00:33:53.192 --> 00:33:54.785
Left Nabhi is there.

00:34:02.477 --> 00:34:06.586
So, before we start I have to tell you there are three conditions,

00:34:06.634 --> 00:34:08.947
which are very simple conditions.

00:34:10.907 --> 00:34:15.860
The first one is, that you have to be fully confident,

00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:19.110
that you all will get your Self-Realisation.

00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:23.402
So it follows the second condition,

00:34:23.483 --> 00:34:28.427
that you should in no way feel guilty about anything.

00:34:28.447 --> 00:34:30.347
It’s a fashion also, to feel guilty,

00:34:30.418 --> 00:34:35.628
all the time, saying “Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.” Even on the phone we use to say, “I beg your pardon,”

00:34:35.708 --> 00:34:38.521
but people say, “Sorry, sorry, sorry.”

00:34:38.527 --> 00:34:43.065
It’s a fashion. To feel guilty is really a fashion.

00:34:43.054 --> 00:34:47.931
If you have done anything wrong, just face it that moment and just leave it.

00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:52.518
But you carry on with it and that works on left Vishuddhi here,

00:34:52.588 --> 00:34:57.097
which is a very…very, very important thing,

00:34:57.898 --> 00:35:02.369
because if your left Vishuddhi is caught up,

00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:07.860
then, you can get spondylitis,

00:35:07.909 --> 00:35:10.469
which is a very horrible disease,

00:35:10.570 --> 00:35:13.713
or another one which is called, angina,

00:35:13.733 --> 00:35:17.143
or you may get very lethargic organs.

00:35:17.164 --> 00:35:20.652
So this is such an important centre, which you are spoiling,

00:35:20.704 --> 00:35:26.181
just with your imaginary… imaginary style of thinking,

00:35:26.202 --> 00:35:28.012
that you are guilty,

00:35:28.003 --> 00:35:32.523
that you have done this wrong. You should not have done that wrong and you feel guilty.

00:35:34.342 --> 00:35:37.161
Of course everybody has right to feel guilty.

00:35:37.184 --> 00:35:39.143
I cannot challenge that.

00:35:39.235 --> 00:35:43.875
They can feel. Everybody has right, even to cut their throat.

00:35:45.985 --> 00:35:49.530
But as a Mother, I am saying, "Better not."

00:35:49.610 --> 00:35:53.940
Why to do something which is injurious to us, good for nothing?

00:35:54.001 --> 00:35:57.795
And at this moment, when you are about to get your Realisation,

00:35:57.806 --> 00:35:59.655
you miss the point

00:35:59.675 --> 00:36:02.255
This is the greatest thing that you are going to you have.

00:36:02.255 --> 00:36:05.117
All your powers are going to express themselves.

00:36:05.146 --> 00:36:08.447
All your glory you are going to know.

00:36:08.478 --> 00:36:12.547
At this time what is the use of feel guilty and condemning yourself?

00:36:13.396 --> 00:36:18.259
So just, what you have to say in your heart is that, “Mother I am not guilty at all.”

00:36:18.288 --> 00:36:19.349
That’s all.

00:36:19.358 --> 00:36:23.809
You don’t have to do anything, but in your heart, please say, just now in your heart

00:36:23.878 --> 00:36:26.869
that, “Mother I am not guilty at all.”

00:36:26.889 --> 00:36:28.380
Second point!

00:36:28.389 --> 00:36:30.869
So now two conditions I have told you.

00:36:32.463 --> 00:36:34.402
The third condition is very simple.

00:36:34.452 --> 00:36:39.322
The third condition is that you have to forgive everyone.

00:36:39.344 --> 00:36:41.364
According to some people it’s very difficult.

00:36:41.422 --> 00:36:46.431
They cannot forgive, but logically try to understand.

00:36:46.443 --> 00:36:49.184
If you forgive or don’t forgive, what do you do?

00:36:50.293 --> 00:36:51.123
Nothing.

00:36:52.393 --> 00:36:56.702
Both ways you do nothing. You just think, “I cannot forgive, I cannot forgive.”

00:36:59.541 --> 00:37:05.101
But if you don’t forgive, then you play in to wrong hands.

00:37:06.572 --> 00:37:10.416
If you don’t forgive, then you play in to wrong hands definitely,

00:37:10.416 --> 00:37:14.126
because the person who has harmed you, or troubled you,

00:37:14.137 --> 00:37:22.155
will always try to deviate the matter. He wouldn't bother to see that I have trouble that person or anything,

00:37:22.295 --> 00:37:26.226
but you are the one, who will be troubling yourself

00:37:26.286 --> 00:37:29.463
and all the time torturing yourself. All the time saying

00:37:29.514 --> 00:37:33.605
that. “I cannot forgive this man. I cannot forgive man.”

00:37:33.626 --> 00:37:36.505
That person might have even forgotten you all.

00:37:38.076 --> 00:37:40.179
So there is no logic in it,

00:37:40.300 --> 00:37:44.679
but more over, when you do not forgive then, the centre, Agnya,

00:37:44.739 --> 00:37:46.059
which is on the optic chiasma

00:37:46.070 --> 00:37:50.699
is like this, constructed like this, absolutely like this

00:37:50.730 --> 00:37:55.583
and to open this you have to forgive, otherwise how will the Kundalini pass.

00:37:55.643 --> 00:37:57.652
It has to open,

00:37:57.753 --> 00:38:02.003
only by forgiving every one. You don’t have to think about whom

00:38:02.063 --> 00:38:05.833
you have to forgive, what they have given, how to forgive,

00:38:05.963 --> 00:38:11.293
how to do it, just say that, “I forgive everyone in general.”

00:38:11.353 --> 00:38:12.963
You don’t have to think about them.

00:38:14.074 --> 00:38:17.304
At this moment, if you say that, you'll feel much lighter.

00:38:18.347 --> 00:38:20.760
So these are the three conditions we have

00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:27.190
and I think it’s not difficult to do it, if you see the logic behind it.

00:38:30.349 --> 00:38:34.619
Now as I told you, it takes about 10-15 minutes that’s all.

00:38:34.648 --> 00:38:37.527
All those who want to do it can do it.

00:38:37.597 --> 00:38:40.489
Those who don’t want it, I cannot force,

00:38:40.570 --> 00:38:41.951
so they should leave.

00:38:42.041 --> 00:38:43.510
There are very simple things,

00:38:45.931 --> 00:38:47.570
for which people object.

00:38:48.335 --> 00:38:53.400
Now I don’t know if it’s too much to do, but if you can take out your shoes,

00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:55.833
it helps a lot. This Mother Earth helps us.

00:38:56.704 --> 00:39:00.643
She is a living body and she sucks in our problems.

00:39:00.704 --> 00:39:03.393
She sucks in our heat.

00:39:03.463 --> 00:39:09.025
So I will be thankful, if you could take out your shoes and keep them away.

00:39:10.675 --> 00:39:15.025
Even this could be a too much condition for the Western people sometimes, in England.

00:39:19.646 --> 00:39:24.083
It’s not so cold also, you can keep your socks on.

00:39:24.103 --> 00:39:25.072
Now!

00:39:28.393 --> 00:39:31.329
You are quite comfortable and sit comfortably.

00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:34.072
You don’t have to stand on your heads.

00:39:34.132 --> 00:39:36.413
You don’t have to go to Himalayas,

00:39:36.463 --> 00:39:39.842
nothing. No starvation, no fasting, nothing,

00:39:39.902 --> 00:39:44.719
it’s something inside. It has nothing to do with your outside behaviour

00:39:47.409 --> 00:39:50.610
and surprisingly it’s all there, intact.

00:39:52.289 --> 00:39:55.686
If of course if you are suffering from some disease,

00:39:55.746 --> 00:39:59.257
may be you have been to some guru, who has harmed you, or something,

00:39:59.317 --> 00:40:03.949
then maybe it may not work out, but that’s one percent.

00:40:03.942 --> 00:40:08.402
But even those, who do not get Realisation, can get it later on

00:40:08.472 --> 00:40:11.590
and there are Sahaja Yogis who can give you Realisation.

00:40:11.710 --> 00:40:14.469
There is no problem on that.

00:40:15.489 --> 00:40:20.076
You are here means, you have already entered in to the Kingdom of the God,

00:40:20.085 --> 00:40:24.815
that you desire to have your Self-Realisation is the biggest thing.

00:40:25.916 --> 00:40:26.675
Now,

00:40:27.695 --> 00:40:31.967
what we have to do, is to put both the hands like this towards me,

00:40:31.976 --> 00:40:36.302
comfortably, again very comfortably, you can

00:40:36.306 --> 00:40:39.822
if you have the hand rest, you can put it on the hand rest,

00:40:39.827 --> 00:40:43.333
or like this both the hands towards me.

00:40:43.342 --> 00:40:46.282
Now, these are two powers,

00:40:46.282 --> 00:40:55.563
Alright now, will you go ahead a little bit there and show them, because everybody should see. I think it's better now.

00:40:55.672 --> 00:40:57.733
Can you see him all of you?

00:40:59.603 --> 00:41:00.902
Alright,

00:41:02.387 --> 00:41:03.143
So

00:41:03.233 --> 00:41:04.963
ha... now better.

00:41:06.713 --> 00:41:09.034
Now you put both the hands like this,

00:41:10.014 --> 00:41:17.143
as these two powers are different, we have put both the feet apart from each other.

00:41:20.643 --> 00:41:24.222
Now please put your right hand on your heart.

00:41:26.902 --> 00:41:29.992
And we will now show you, what we will have to do.

00:41:29.992 --> 00:41:34.431
In the Heart resides the Spirit,

00:41:34.583 --> 00:41:37.619
that’s the reflection of God Almighty.

00:41:39.898 --> 00:41:45.635
If you become the Spirit you become your own Master.

00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:50.255
So you take down your right hand

00:41:50.375 --> 00:41:53.014
on the lower portion of the abdomen,

00:41:53.085 --> 00:41:56.518
on the left hand side. We are just working on the left hand side

00:41:57.909 --> 00:42:02.710
and here is the centre of your Mastery,

00:42:05.454 --> 00:42:09.152
which is created by great masters and prophets,

00:42:09.143 --> 00:42:11.264
which you have to awaken.

00:42:11.704 --> 00:42:15.085
Now please take your right hand, on the lower portion of your abdomen,

00:42:16.835 --> 00:42:18.494
on the left side again.

00:42:20.505 --> 00:42:25.565
Surprisingly, this is the centre of Pure Divine Knowledge.

00:42:27.355 --> 00:42:31.362
You’ll later on know how it works. It’s very interesting.

00:42:32.969 --> 00:42:37.027
Now raise your hand again, in the upper portion of your abdomen.

00:42:37.429 --> 00:42:38.688
Please.

00:42:39.259 --> 00:42:43.862
And then, raise your right hand on your Heart again.

00:42:45.592 --> 00:42:49.251
Now put right your hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder

00:42:49.311 --> 00:42:52.210
and turn head to the your right.

00:42:52.262 --> 00:42:58.862
This is the centre, I have told you, when you are guilty it is caught and how it is dangerous.

00:42:59.791 --> 00:43:05.891
Now, take your right hand on top of your forehead across

00:43:05.942 --> 00:43:07.351
and put down your head.

00:43:07.742 --> 00:43:13.501
This is the centre for forgiving others.

00:43:17.871 --> 00:43:20.552
Now please take your right hand on the back side of your head.

00:43:20.572 --> 00:43:23.452
Push back your head. These are all the centres.

00:43:23.442 --> 00:43:26.702
Now this centre is very important

00:43:26.822 --> 00:43:29.922
without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes,

00:43:30.021 --> 00:43:35.438
for your satisfaction, you will have to ask for forgiveness from this All-Pervading Power.

00:43:36.538 --> 00:43:39.038
Then, please stretch your palm, fully,

00:43:39.978 --> 00:43:42.447
stretch your palm. It's the last centre,

00:43:42.547 --> 00:43:47.507
which is on the fontanel bone area.

00:43:47.597 --> 00:43:52.956
So put the centre of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area,

00:43:52.967 --> 00:43:56.416
which may be hot, which may be cool.

00:43:56.436 --> 00:44:00.088
Now push back your fingers. This is important.

00:44:00.108 --> 00:44:06.369
Please push back your fingers, so there is good pressure on your scalp.

00:44:06.378 --> 00:44:10.239
Please bend your head as far as possible

00:44:10.297 --> 00:44:15.099
and now move your right hand fully,

00:44:16.838 --> 00:44:21.485
moving the scalp with the pressure seven times.

00:44:22.875 --> 00:44:25.440
Please bend your head that’s important.

00:44:29.965 --> 00:44:31.775
That’s all we have to do.

00:44:33.983 --> 00:44:39.713
Now again please close your eyes

00:44:39.824 --> 00:44:42.454
and you will have to open them till I tell you.

00:44:42.514 --> 00:44:49.101
But before that, see that your both the legs or feet are apart from each other.

00:44:49.112 --> 00:44:54.353
Left hand is on your lap or comfortably put toward me like this.

00:44:54.431 --> 00:44:58.543
And now put your right hand on your heart.

00:44:59.632 --> 00:45:02.913
You can take out your spectacles. It will help you,

00:45:02.972 --> 00:45:07.295
moreover, till I tell you, please don’t open your eyes.

00:45:10.206 --> 00:45:16.554
Now close your eyes, slowly, not with pressure, but slowly, delicately.

00:45:17.543 --> 00:45:21.039
Now, don’t worry about where your thoughts are,

00:45:21.108 --> 00:45:23.199
what you have to do, concentrate, nothing.

00:45:23.277 --> 00:45:26.563
Kundalini will do all the job. You just leave it alone.

00:45:36.914 --> 00:45:42.518
Now here is the centre of your Spirit,

00:45:45.226 --> 00:45:50.635
so here you have to ask a fundamental question about yourself to me.

00:45:50.666 --> 00:45:54.806
You can call me Mother or you can call me Shri Mataji.

00:45:54.876 --> 00:45:57.976
So please ask a question,

00:45:58.067 --> 00:46:03.460
“Mother, am I the Spirit?”

00:46:03.481 --> 00:46:05.572
Please ask the question in your heart

00:46:05.601 --> 00:46:09.291
“Mother, am I the Spirit?” Three times!

00:46:17.831 --> 00:46:26.516
I have told you, that if you become the Spirit, you become your Master,

00:46:26.530 --> 00:46:30.760
because in the light of your Spirit, you know what is to be done.

00:46:30.831 --> 00:46:32.989
Your Spirit guides you.

00:46:34.485 --> 00:46:37.789
So now please take your right hand

00:46:37.797 --> 00:46:44.853
on the left-hand side of your abdomen in the upper part and press it.

00:46:44.862 --> 00:46:49.222
Here you ask me another question about yourself,

00:46:49.313 --> 00:46:52.202
three times in your heart,

00:46:52.282 --> 00:46:58.860
“Mother, am I my own Master?”

00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:03.260
“Mother, am I my own Master?”

00:47:15.458 --> 00:47:19.208
I have already told you, that I respect your freedom

00:47:19.228 --> 00:47:23.744
and this Pure Knowledge cannot be given to you,

00:47:23.804 --> 00:47:25.054
with force,

00:47:25.056 --> 00:47:27.027
so you have to ask for it.

00:47:28.527 --> 00:47:35.166
So please take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left hand side

00:47:35.175 --> 00:47:39.346
and ask six times,

00:47:39.405 --> 00:47:42.518
because this centre has got six petals.

00:47:45.438 --> 00:47:50.507
“Mother, please give me Pure Divine Knowledge.”

00:47:50.577 --> 00:47:56.052
You have to ask for it. I cannot force on you. Please ask six times.

00:48:05.981 --> 00:48:08.998
As soon as you ask for Pure Knowledge,

00:48:09.018 --> 00:48:11.411
the Kundalini starts rising

00:48:11.472 --> 00:48:13.572
like a plumule in a seed

00:48:13.652 --> 00:48:22.023
and is going upward now, so we have to help the higher chakras with our self confidence.

00:48:24.652 --> 00:48:26.536
So now please put your right hand

00:48:27.876 --> 00:48:31.643
in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side

00:48:31.677 --> 00:48:38.561
and here you have to say with full confidence,

00:48:40.161 --> 00:48:42.541
because this is the centre of your Mastery.

00:48:43.972 --> 00:48:47.858
“Mother, I am my own Master."

00:48:47.918 --> 00:48:55.018
Please say it ten times, “Mother, I am my own Master.”

00:49:07.072 --> 00:49:08.001
Now,

00:49:08.092 --> 00:49:13.731
please raise your right hand on the heart.

00:49:27.021 --> 00:49:31.884
I have already told you, that you are the Pure Spirit.

00:49:34.818 --> 00:49:38.297
You are not this body, this mind, these conditionings,

00:49:38.338 --> 00:49:41.494
this ego, these emotions,

00:49:41.521 --> 00:49:45.371
but you are the Pure Spirit.

00:49:45.371 --> 00:49:50.442
So now here you ask twelve times.

00:49:53.882 --> 00:49:57.626
You have to say with full confidence, twelve times

00:49:59.846 --> 00:50:02.916
“Mother, I am the Pure Spirit.”

00:50:04.858 --> 00:50:10.849
“Mother, I am the Pure Spirit.”

00:50:16.516 --> 00:50:18.614
I have already told you,

00:50:18.715 --> 00:50:21.005
that if you feel guilty

00:50:21.056 --> 00:50:23.364
and you don’t forgive yourself,

00:50:24.166 --> 00:50:30.021
you develop a problem for your left Vishuddhi,

00:50:30.010 --> 00:50:33.061
which is very dangerous for your health,

00:50:33.121 --> 00:50:35.771
as well as for your Self Realisation.

00:50:35.860 --> 00:50:39.579
So at this moment, you have to forgive yourself fully.

00:50:41.130 --> 00:50:49.666
So now raise your right hand in the left corner of your neck and shoulder

00:50:49.677 --> 00:50:53.597
and put your head to your right.

00:50:55.556 --> 00:51:01.914
Here you have to say sixteen times, with full confidence in yourself.

00:51:01.918 --> 00:51:08.043
“Mother, I am not guilty at all.” Please say it sixteen times.

00:51:08.047 --> 00:51:11.967
Have faith in yourself, just say I tell you are not guilty,

00:51:12.047 --> 00:51:15.217
you are human beings and human beings can commit mistakes.

00:51:15.288 --> 00:51:20.748
You are not gods, so please say it with full confidence sixteen times.

00:51:25.900 --> 00:51:29.753
Most intricate part is that,

00:51:29.764 --> 00:51:35.463
you have to forgive every one without thinking about them, in general.

00:51:37.094 --> 00:51:38.215
If you don’t forgive,

00:51:38.206 --> 00:51:41.456
then this chakra will be completely constricted

00:51:41.525 --> 00:51:43.766
and the Kundalini won’t rise.

00:51:44.326 --> 00:51:48.806
All your life you have tortured yourself, by not forgiving others

00:51:48.864 --> 00:51:54.315
and now at this moment, if you don’t forgive this centre won’t open at all,

00:51:54.364 --> 00:51:57.476
so you will miss again your Self Realisation.

00:51:57.545 --> 00:52:01.652
You have to ask forgiveness from this All-Pervading Power,

00:52:01.731 --> 00:52:03.681
just for your satisfaction.

00:52:04.442 --> 00:52:06.871
Don’t count your mistakes please.

00:52:07.851 --> 00:52:11.751
Don’t feel guilty in any way.

00:52:11.780 --> 00:52:15.231
Now put your right hand on the back side of your head

00:52:15.239 --> 00:52:18.331
and push back your head as far as possible

00:52:21.001 --> 00:52:22.726
and here you have to say,

00:52:27.315 --> 00:52:36.239
“Oh Divine Power, if I have done anything knowingly or unknowingly,

00:52:38.369 --> 00:52:43.244
something that is wrong, please forgive me.”

00:52:43.253 --> 00:52:45.847
This also you have to say from your heart,

00:52:45.842 --> 00:52:51.333
not how many times counting or anything, but from your heart you have to say.

00:53:01.830 --> 00:53:04.746
Some people find it difficult to forgive themselves

00:53:04.766 --> 00:53:09.275
and some people find it difficult to forgive others.

00:53:19.626 --> 00:53:22.637
Now stretch your palm

00:53:22.688 --> 00:53:29.505
fully, put the centre of your palm on top of your fontanel bone area

00:53:30.376 --> 00:53:33.405
and push back your fingers.

00:53:37.666 --> 00:53:39.896
Now, please bend your head.

00:53:41.407 --> 00:53:45.956
Again at this centre, I cannot force Self-Realisation on you.

00:53:46.007 --> 00:53:48.487
You have ask for it.

00:53:48.509 --> 00:53:51.958
So, please move you hands seven times.

00:53:52.047 --> 00:53:55.467
Please put down your head. Please put down your head.

00:53:55.478 --> 00:54:01.599
Please move your scalp with your hand,

00:54:01.601 --> 00:54:04.487
with a pressure, because you have pushed back your fingers,

00:54:04.472 --> 00:54:09.007
seven times, slowly, clock wise, saying,

00:54:09.916 --> 00:54:12.376
“Mother, please give me Self Realisation.”

00:54:13.878 --> 00:54:15.757
You have to say it,

00:54:15.768 --> 00:54:21.088
unless or until you ask for it, I cannot force it on you, so please say it.

00:55:09.476 --> 00:55:13.076
Now please take down your hands.

00:55:13.155 --> 00:55:16.045
Please open your eyes, slowly.

00:55:21.989 --> 00:55:24.661
Put both the hands towards me, like this.

00:55:27.690 --> 00:55:29.811
Now

00:55:33.487 --> 00:55:36.773
put your right hand towards me like this

00:55:36.833 --> 00:55:42.362
and with the left hand, you bend your head and see for yourself,

00:55:42.431 --> 00:55:48.202
if there is cool or a hot breeze coming out of your head.

00:55:50.793 --> 00:55:53.556
Could be hot if you have not forgiven.

00:55:53.617 --> 00:55:56.327
Don’t put the hand on top of your head.

00:55:56.327 --> 00:55:59.389
So away from it and move your hand.

00:55:59.396 --> 00:56:03.978
Sometimes it can be very close, or it can be far away.

00:56:03.978 --> 00:56:11.027
So please bend your head and see for yourself if there is a cool, or a hot breeze like sensation

00:56:11.097 --> 00:56:14.893
coming from the fontanel bone area and don’t doubt.

00:56:14.922 --> 00:56:17.563
May be you might think it’s air conditioning and all that,

00:56:17.632 --> 00:56:19.612
but there is no air conditioning in your head.

00:56:19.632 --> 00:56:21.972
So, see it if for yourself, nicely.

00:56:22.713 --> 00:56:24.498
Now,

00:56:24.501 --> 00:56:28.681
please put your left hand towards me and put the right hand... now

00:56:28.739 --> 00:56:33.947
you see if there is cool breeze or a hot breeze like sensation,

00:56:33.960 --> 00:56:36.577
coming out of your head.

00:56:36.603 --> 00:56:37.938
Now,

00:56:37.931 --> 00:56:43.181
turn your hand on all the sides.

00:56:43.273 --> 00:56:46.489
You can also see if some people get it very far.

00:56:46.512 --> 00:56:49.032
Some people get it like a jet out.

00:56:49.103 --> 00:56:54.012
Some it is closer to the head. It depends on the personality of a person.

00:56:55.603 --> 00:56:57.793
Alright. Now have another one,

00:56:57.893 --> 00:57:02.666
right one, right hand last, lastly.

00:57:02.755 --> 00:57:05.965
Please put your left hand now, bend your head

00:57:05.965 --> 00:57:12.014
and see for yourself, there is a cool or a hot breeze coming out of your head.

00:57:13.873 --> 00:57:18.443
It’s little further also you can see clearly, if there is.

00:57:20.349 --> 00:57:21.534
Now,

00:57:25.364 --> 00:57:29.255
please put both the hands towards the sky

00:57:29.315 --> 00:57:36.860
and push back your head and here you have to ask a question.

00:57:37.010 --> 00:57:41.141
Any one of these questions, you can ask three times.

00:57:41.260 --> 00:57:48.639
The first question is, you can say is, “Is this the All-Pervading Power of Divine Love?”

00:57:48.777 --> 00:57:53.599
“Mother, is this is the All-Pervading Power of Divine Love?”

00:57:54.500 --> 00:57:57.110
Second question could be,

00:57:58.018 --> 00:58:01.829
“Is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?”

00:58:01.880 --> 00:58:06.889
Third question could be, “Mother is this the Brahma Chaitanya?”

00:58:06.898 --> 00:58:11.059
Ask any one of these questions three times.

00:58:16.485 --> 00:58:18.510
Now bring down the hands

00:58:20.400 --> 00:58:24.250
and put both the hands towards me and watch me without thinking.

00:58:33.396 --> 00:58:38.737
All those who have felt cool or hot breeze on their fingertips,

00:58:38.817 --> 00:58:40.739
or on their palms,

00:58:40.838 --> 00:58:46.039
or out of their fontanel bone area, which was a soft bone in childhood,

00:58:46.047 --> 00:58:49.478
please raise both your hands.

00:58:54.826 --> 00:58:56.635
Every one of you!

00:58:56.706 --> 00:59:00.590
May God bless you Sydney people. I am so happy.

00:59:00.661 --> 00:59:02.501
May God bless you.

00:59:03.400 --> 00:59:04.916
Now keep it up.

00:59:04.920 --> 00:59:09.471
You have to come to the collective and keep it up, and know the knowledge, all of it.

00:59:09.570 --> 00:59:10.800
Can I see this side?

00:59:10.860 --> 00:59:12.860
All of you got it?

00:59:12.931 --> 00:59:15.380
Oh my God!

00:59:18.010 --> 00:59:18.981
It’s remarkable.

00:59:19.041 --> 00:59:20.684
This side also?

00:59:23.271 --> 00:59:26.989
It’s really remarkable. May God bless you.

00:59:27.369 --> 00:59:28.710
It’s tremendous.

00:59:28.780 --> 00:59:31.226
Some didn’t get, very, very few.

00:59:31.326 --> 00:59:35.614
One here, one there,

00:59:35.675 --> 00:59:42.697
so they can also come later on, on the stage and Sahaja Yogis will give them Realisation.

00:59:42.788 --> 00:59:47.157
No problem, but we will have one song just before I leave.

00:59:47.268 --> 00:59:49.538
I hope you will keep sitting till then

00:59:49.617 --> 00:59:53.262
and you can also clap, so your hands become more active.

00:59:53.262 --> 00:59:59.983
Some song that will give you nice clapping rhythm, which one?

01:00:37.025 --> 01:00:38.510
You put your hand like this.

01:00:38.570 --> 01:00:42.480
It will increase with the songs. You'll feel the Cool Breeze increase with the songs.

01:00:58.869 --> 01:01:01.179
Now just feel your vibrations

01:01:01.289 --> 01:01:05.585
just feel with this clapping, how they have improved or not.

01:01:08.849 --> 01:01:09.795
Alright!

01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:12.786
It's much better, the flow.

01:01:12.775 --> 01:01:16.706
Also you can see on your head, you're much better.

01:01:16.726 --> 01:01:21.326
As the lady had seen, the one described by Lord Mayor,

01:01:21.416 --> 01:01:24.021
you can see on other's head also,

01:01:24.045 --> 01:01:25.371
if it is there or not.

01:01:25.358 --> 01:01:27.902
With the neighbours you can see

01:01:27.918 --> 01:01:30.068
It's there.

01:01:31.608 --> 01:01:35.393
Not on top, here little.

01:01:37.804 --> 01:01:38.753
It’s open now.
