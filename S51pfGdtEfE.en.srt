1
00:00:00,665 --> 00:00:06,213
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

2
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:28,013
Actually we are all seeking the truth.
So many of us,

3
00:00:28,214 --> 00:00:37,441
but so far, so many couldn't find and they
are lost.

4
00:00:37,642 --> 00:00:44,032
But what is the truth? What is the truth
about yourself?

5
00:00:44,233 --> 00:00:54,453
The truth is that you are not this body,
you are not these emotions

6
00:00:54,654 --> 00:01:02,038
but what are you? You are the spirit.

7
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:11,603
All the great saints and incarnations have
said that you are the spirit

8
00:01:11,804 --> 00:01:19,364
and what we are trying to find out is our
selfhood.

9
00:01:19,565 --> 00:01:26,216
We are after that research about ourselves.

10
00:01:26,417 --> 00:01:33,153
We've done lots of mistakes also
by misguided people

11
00:01:33,354 --> 00:01:44,512
but I must say that there is a built-in
arrangement within us, every one of you,

12
00:01:44,713 --> 00:01:55,369
which will take you to that selfhood,
which will give you that self-realization.

13
00:01:55,570 --> 00:02:04,608
It's very surprising that they have not
talked about Kundalini so far.

14
00:02:04,824 --> 00:02:14,933
There is a power within all of you which
is the Kundalini,

15
00:02:15,134 --> 00:02:21,029
which is three and a half coiled energy

16
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:35,812
in your, I should say, behind your
triangular bone, or it is inside it

17
00:02:36,013 --> 00:02:42,455
and is waiting for that moment when it can
be awakened

18
00:02:42,656 --> 00:02:47,982
and it can pass through the different
centers

19
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:54,401
piercing through your fontanel bone area.

20
00:02:54,602 --> 00:03:00,455
And that's how you get your
self-realization,

21
00:03:00,656 --> 00:03:07,393
that you feel cool breeze coming out
of your fontanel bone area.

22
00:03:07,594 --> 00:03:12,708
It's an actualization. It is not My lecture

23
00:03:12,909 --> 00:03:19,085
or reading or anything. It's actualization
which has to take place.

24
00:03:19,286 --> 00:03:25,823
If you don't get it, doesn't matter. Next
time you can get it,

25
00:03:26,024 --> 00:03:31,927
but most of them do get it in a collective
way. It's very surprising

26
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:38,616
that it took so much, so many years
for people

27
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:46,308
to come to this state where they are asking
for the real thing.

28
00:03:46,509 --> 00:03:52,055
This is your own. This power is your own.

29
00:03:52,256 --> 00:03:56,727
And it is just waiting there to be
awakened.

30
00:03:56,928 --> 00:04:06,482
Any amount of lecturing, any amount
of reading, nothing can help you.

31
00:04:06,683 --> 00:04:16,257
What is needed is just a quiet mind and
it works.

32
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:21,963
It works under every circumstances.
It's very surprising,

33
00:04:22,164 --> 00:04:30,320
this was the time perhaps, was meant to be
this way.

34
00:04:31,165 --> 00:04:36,419
I've been to this country many a times
before also.

35
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:40,572
First time when I came, I was so surprised

36
00:04:40,773 --> 00:04:47,251
how people were running after falsehood.
So I gave it up.

37
00:04:47,452 --> 00:04:54,055
After nine years I came, thinking that
what's the matter with these people?

38
00:04:54,256 --> 00:04:58,644
Why can't they understand what they have
to achieve? What they have to get?

39
00:04:58,845 --> 00:05:07,036
Whatever is written and said by all
the saints, by all the incarnations.

40
00:05:07,237 --> 00:05:16,852
I couldn't understand why they were
satisfied with all kinds of nonsense.

41
00:05:17,053 --> 00:05:25,363
And somehow they came to America and
prospered here with all their untruth.

42
00:05:25,564 --> 00:05:33,529
It's very sad that we have lost so many
beautiful seekers in their pursuit.

43
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:40,028
Now I have to tell you one thing, simple
thing, that you must know

44
00:05:40,229 --> 00:05:45,657
that you have every right to know yourself,

45
00:05:45,858 --> 00:05:50,427
to become self-realized, every one of you.

46
00:05:50,628 --> 00:05:58,545
Nobody can force it and nobody can deny it.

47
00:05:58,746 --> 00:06:06,563
It is your fundamental right by which you
can get your self-realization.

48
00:06:06,764 --> 00:06:10,435
If you are a human being that's sufficient,

49
00:06:10,636 --> 00:06:16,779
whether you belong to America, or to India
or to any other place,

50
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:23,320
everyone has this right, to get your
self-realization.

51
00:06:23,521 --> 00:06:30,867
As a result of self-realization what
happens, that's the point.

52
00:06:31,068 --> 00:06:39,217
Firstly, you start feeling the Divine
vibrations on your fingertips.

53
00:06:39,418 --> 00:06:47,584
Divine vibrations like cool breeze and it
starts flowing through your hands.

54
00:06:47,785 --> 00:06:54,013
You'll be amazed when it first happens, you
start doubting.

55
00:06:54,214 --> 00:06:58,975
I know people who went and closed their
doors and windows,

56
00:06:59,176 --> 00:07:04,603
wanted to test and find out if they had
those cool breeze.

57
00:07:04,804 --> 00:07:17,719
You have it. It's a sign of yourself
emitting these pure vibrations.

58
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:22,554
As a result of that so many other things
can happen.

59
00:07:22,755 --> 00:07:30,749
But the most important thing is that you
become a very peaceful person.

60
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:35,872
You become a very balanced person

61
00:07:36,073 --> 00:07:43,492
and you become that witness about which
all the religions have talked.

62
00:07:43,693 --> 00:07:51,555
You get to the state of that witness. And
once you become the witness,

63
00:07:52,063 --> 00:08:01,873
you see the whole picture, the whole world
in a very different manner.

64
00:08:02,074 --> 00:08:10,209
You become the witness. It's a state
in which, watch everything.

65
00:08:10,409 --> 00:08:20,115
You do not react but you watch and your
presence itself will help people.

66
00:08:20,316 --> 00:08:26,918
I know America nowadays is in a very

67
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:35,053
difficult state and people are quite
frightened type.

68
00:08:35,254 --> 00:08:39,730
If they were realized souls they would
never have been.

69
00:08:39,931 --> 00:08:45,759
The power of realization is so great, not
that it enlightens you

70
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:51,883
but it enlightens others, it enlightens
the atmosphere.

71
00:08:52,084 --> 00:08:58,940
So it’s very important that you get your
last breakthrough of your evolution

72
00:08:59,141 --> 00:09:05,488
and get to that state which we call as
self-realization.

73
00:09:05,689 --> 00:09:13,023
It is a entry into the Divine powers

74
00:09:13,224 --> 00:09:20,720
and this spiritual realm of life which is
very, very surprisingly,

75
00:09:20,921 --> 00:09:28,458
very much surprisingly is very difficult
to understand otherwise.

76
00:09:28,659 --> 00:09:35,171
But once you become a realized soul
automatically you know what it is.

77
00:09:35,372 --> 00:09:42,583
You become so sensitive, at the same time
you are so well protected.

78
00:09:42,784 --> 00:09:46,745
You can solve many problems.

79
00:09:46,946 --> 00:09:53,441
You can do so many things which you could
never have been able to do.

80
00:09:53,642 --> 00:09:59,726
The reason is, now you have become
empowered by the Divine force.

81
00:09:59,927 --> 00:10:04,921
This is what you all are seeking, nothing
else.

82
00:10:05,122 --> 00:10:11,465
This is what you want, nothing else. And
this is what you should get it.

83
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:20,728
No use going into blind place and trying

84
00:10:20,929 --> 00:10:27,016
to find out something which you do not
know.

85
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:32,959
With this, your health will improve,

86
00:10:33,824 --> 00:10:41,708
your wealth will improve, your temperament
will improve

87
00:10:41,909 --> 00:10:48,461
and you'll become such a compassionate,
such a beautiful person

88
00:10:48,662 --> 00:10:55,777
that people will be amazed how you have
achieved this state.

89
00:10:55,978 --> 00:11:01,634
You become so collective. So very
collective.

90
00:11:01,835 --> 00:11:08,534
I am surprised how this collective
temperament has come into

91
00:11:08,735 --> 00:11:14,072
all the Sahaja yogis, how they work it out.

92
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:21,923
It's very beautiful and surprisingly you
may belong to any, any country,

93
00:11:22,124 --> 00:11:29,530
far away from each other, where the people
don't know each other

94
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:33,593
and such love and such understanding.

95
00:11:33,794 --> 00:11:39,920
This is beyond Me sometimes, you see, how
beautifully

96
00:11:40,121 --> 00:11:46,206
they blend together, mix together and learn
from each other.

97
00:11:46,407 --> 00:11:55,619
Such love, such compassion and such power
is then your own, your own.

98
00:11:55,820 --> 00:12:02,895
You don't have to pay for it. You don't
have to do anything of the kind;

99
00:12:03,096 --> 00:12:08,042
just you have to get your Kundalini
awakened.

100
00:12:08,243 --> 00:12:14,153
which is very, very easy to do and it works
out.

101
00:12:14,354 --> 00:12:20,727
The time has come, I think, for en-mass
awakening, the time has come

102
00:12:20,928 --> 00:12:24,934
and that's why, well we have to work it
out.

103
00:12:25,135 --> 00:12:30,314
It's not something miraculous, I think.

104
00:12:30,515 --> 00:12:37,187
If you see our evolution: from what stage
to what stage to what stage.

105
00:12:37,388 --> 00:12:43,357
Now at a human stage what do we have
to achieve?

106
00:12:43,558 --> 00:12:50,815
Why are we human beings? What is the part
we have to play?

107
00:12:51,016 --> 00:12:54,726
Because you are a spiritual personality.

108
00:12:54,927 --> 00:12:58,732
You have to become that spiritual
personality.

109
00:12:58,933 --> 00:13:06,632
It's not by reading books or doing all
kinds of rituals that you will achieve it.

110
00:13:06,832 --> 00:13:13,011
It’s just within yourself where
the Kundalini rises,

111
00:13:13,212 --> 00:13:18,118
passes through these various centers and
gets you connected

112
00:13:18,319 --> 00:13:24,376
to the Divine power which is all pervading,
which is everywhere.

113
00:13:24,577 --> 00:13:31,389
Then you can learn what is this, how it
works, how it helps you,

114
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:36,494
how it educates you, and how it gives you
knowledge.

115
00:13:36,695 --> 00:13:42,307
It's really remarkable and it works
in every country.

116
00:13:42,515 --> 00:13:48,860
It's very surprising that people told me
that in America it will never work.

117
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:56,875
I said, "Why?" "Because they are only after
gurus

118
00:13:57,091 --> 00:14:02,781
and would take money and make big things".
I said, "All right.

119
00:14:02,982 --> 00:14:08,379
After all they are human beings. And as
human beings

120
00:14:08,702 --> 00:14:17,352
all their ideas will change. And they will
seek their peace and joy".

121
00:14:17,723 --> 00:14:22,968
I must say that today in America it has
worked out wonders.

122
00:14:23,175 --> 00:14:29,330
In all the cities here, we have people who
are following Sahaja Yoga.

123
00:14:29,531 --> 00:14:38,304
Everyone who has come to Me is just
the same

124
00:14:38,505 --> 00:14:47,294
as any other Sahaja yogi who is from any
other country. Can you believe it?

125
00:14:47,524 --> 00:14:49,921
There's no difference at all

126
00:14:50,122 --> 00:14:55,685
in their expression, in their love,
in their compassion.

127
00:14:55,909 --> 00:15:02,310
All of them are so good and so beautiful.

128
00:15:02,511 --> 00:15:08,658
It is hard to believe that they've
forgotten all the differences.

129
00:15:08,859 --> 00:15:11,872
And how have they mixed up together

130
00:15:12,057 --> 00:15:18,532
and are in such a loving state and
enjoyable state.

131
00:15:18,733 --> 00:15:26,653
It's a very different area into which you
have to enter and you enter into it,

132
00:15:26,854 --> 00:15:32,828
without doing anything whatsoever, only
your Kundalini rises

133
00:15:33,029 --> 00:15:38,138
and gives your self-realization. It is
effortless.

134
00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:44,326
Don't have to make any efforts, not
standing on your head or anything.

135
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:49,044
Just wherever you are sitting, you get your
self-realization.

136
00:15:49,245 --> 00:15:55,227
And once you get it, you grow into it.
You grow into it so well.

137
00:15:55,428 --> 00:16:03,043
You become so empowered. You are amazed
sometimes.

138
00:16:03,244 --> 00:16:09,767
You see people who were never poets;
they've suddenly become poets.

139
00:16:10,003 --> 00:16:16,646
There are people who never could do
anything on the stage, were so frightened,

140
00:16:16,847 --> 00:16:19,508
have become great speakers.

141
00:16:19,709 --> 00:16:25,677
There are musicians who said, "Mother,
we didn't know how to sing".

142
00:16:25,878 --> 00:16:30,681
So all kinds of creativity comes into it.

143
00:16:30,882 --> 00:16:35,755
How it comes and how suddenly it has
started they don't know.

144
00:16:35,956 --> 00:16:41,260
You become extremely creative and you start
appreciating

145
00:16:41,461 --> 00:16:47,788
in a very subtle way the creativity
of others.

146
00:16:48,947 --> 00:16:54,708
Then, this stupid thing called greed,

147
00:16:54,909 --> 00:17:01,387
which has captured your country now, also,
is like this:

148
00:17:01,588 --> 00:17:08,958
that when people get some money, the taste
of that money makes them greedy.

149
00:17:09,131 --> 00:17:15,612
As simple as that. Now what happens with
Sahaja Yoga,

150
00:17:15,813 --> 00:17:23,864
you don't have any greed. The greed
finishes. You are a satisfied soul.

151
00:17:24,065 --> 00:17:34,079
Why will you ask for so many cars, so many
aeroplanes? Not needed.

152
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:39,556
Because you become a wise person, become,
becoming is the point.

153
00:17:39,757 --> 00:17:47,717
You become so wise that you don't hanker
after things.

154
00:17:47,918 --> 00:17:53,556
You are extremely satisfied. But as
a result of that

155
00:17:53,757 --> 00:18:01,060
you are completely, fully blessed

156
00:18:01,261 --> 00:18:09,024
with a very beautiful life and everything
that you want is there.

157
00:18:09,225 --> 00:18:13,299
This is the blessings of the Divine

158
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:19,154
and so many miracles. So many miracles
that you are amazed

159
00:18:19,355 --> 00:18:24,216
how are you blessed. What have you done
to deserve this?

160
00:18:24,417 --> 00:18:31,556
You are now the spirit. These are
the blessings of the spirit.

161
00:18:31,757 --> 00:18:35,964
People get completely cured, no doubt,

162
00:18:36,165 --> 00:18:42,992
but also they become very compassionate,
extremely compassionate.

163
00:18:43,193 --> 00:18:47,014
And they don't understand from where did
they get this compassion,

164
00:18:47,215 --> 00:18:51,574
very compassionate people.

165
00:18:51,923 --> 00:18:59,475
Thirdly, they become thoughtlessly aware.

166
00:18:59,676 --> 00:19:04,041
That means complete silence within.

167
00:19:04,242 --> 00:19:13,058
You see something and you become silent.
You don't react, just you see.

168
00:19:13,259 --> 00:19:17,396
So enjoyable to see something clearly.

169
00:19:17,597 --> 00:19:25,121
But when you see something, your vibrations
act.

170
00:19:25,322 --> 00:19:31,333
It's a very powerful personality that when
you see something

171
00:19:31,534 --> 00:19:36,098
your vibrations act and they work it out.

172
00:19:36,299 --> 00:19:40,906
They can solve all kinds of problems.

173
00:19:41,107 --> 00:19:47,595
These vibrations can tell you what's wrong
with the other person,

174
00:19:47,796 --> 00:19:55,112
what's wrong with certain countries. And
also you should know how to correct it.

175
00:19:55,313 --> 00:20:05,228
If you can find out how you can correct
this, problem is solved.

176
00:20:05,429 --> 00:20:09,301
And it's so gentle and so sweet

177
00:20:09,502 --> 00:20:15,069
that you don't have to fight with this,
it just works.

178
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:20,998
You're all capable of becoming that
powerful person,

179
00:20:21,199 --> 00:20:26,054
of that compassion, of that love and
understanding

180
00:20:26,255 --> 00:20:34,243
and you just develop this thoughtless
awareness, which is a very important state,

181
00:20:34,444 --> 00:20:40,631
which you don't feel bored, you don't get
upset,

182
00:20:40,832 --> 00:20:45,327
you're absolutely silently watching
everything

183
00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:49,483
and you become such a congenial personality

184
00:20:49,684 --> 00:20:56,811
that those who come in contact with you
also become very, very congenial.

185
00:20:57,012 --> 00:21:03,044
You can give realizations to others. You
yourself can do it.

186
00:21:03,245 --> 00:21:10,346
It's not only that you get your realization
but you can give realization.

187
00:21:10,547 --> 00:21:18,892
It's very surprising that you become so
powerful. You can change the atmosphere.

188
00:21:19,093 --> 00:21:25,112
You can work out so many things just with
turning of your mind

189
00:21:25,313 --> 00:21:35,750
and all the bad things like, we should say,
all the things that are very destructive,

190
00:21:35,951 --> 00:21:40,808
you just don't like it, just give up like
that.

191
00:21:41,009 --> 00:21:46,977
And also you protect yourself. You are
completely protected

192
00:21:47,178 --> 00:21:49,668
from all the evil doers.

193
00:21:49,869 --> 00:21:55,683
So is important that you become that
powerful personality

194
00:21:55,884 --> 00:22:00,996
which I call as the spiritual person.
People have been talking about it,

195
00:22:01,197 --> 00:22:05,822
saying all kinds of things. They read all
kinds of stories.

196
00:22:06,023 --> 00:22:10,144
Now the time has come for
the actualization.

197
00:22:10,345 --> 00:22:17,998
And this is so important, so very important
for you, that you get it.

198
00:22:18,199 --> 00:22:22,715
The time has come. It's your right, it's
your fundamental right, I say,

199
00:22:22,916 --> 00:22:27,160
to get to that state where you become

200
00:22:27,361 --> 00:22:32,783
absolutely a personality which is
spiritual,

201
00:22:32,984 --> 00:22:43,373
which is empowered and which knows how to,
how to use this power, how to work it out.

202
00:22:43,574 --> 00:22:53,665
It's very surprising how the more advanced
we are, the less chances there are,

203
00:22:53,866 --> 00:22:58,231
because we are lost, lost in the forest
of advancement.

204
00:22:58,432 --> 00:23:05,185
But despite all that, people find it so
difficult

205
00:23:05,386 --> 00:23:10,679
to exist in such busy atmosphere,

206
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:16,050
they come to Sahaj and they get completely
peaceful.

207
00:23:16,251 --> 00:23:22,716
Whatever it is, whatever kind of life it
is, they are absolutely peaceful.

208
00:23:22,917 --> 00:23:29,814
And you give peace to others. I have spoken
for thousands of times

209
00:23:30,015 --> 00:23:37,104
all over the world and I think it works.
It does work.

210
00:23:37,305 --> 00:23:41,292
They wanted Me to allow you to ask some
questions.

211
00:23:41,493 --> 00:23:45,264
I don't mind you asking Me questions

212
00:23:45,465 --> 00:23:55,065
but the problem is, this questioning also
can be quite stupid sometimes.

213
00:23:57,345 --> 00:24:03,096
If you want to waste sometime on certain
amount of stupidity, you can ask Me,

214
00:24:03,297 --> 00:24:06,903
I don't mind.

215
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:15,071
So, if somebody wants to ask Me questions?

216
00:24:26,731 --> 00:24:37,159
So have you got some people who want to ask
questions? No. All right.

217
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:43,961
So now, we'll have the session for
self-realization.

218
00:24:44,162 --> 00:24:47,686
It's very simple.

219
00:24:52,452 --> 00:24:59,781
What you have to do is to put both your
hands like this towards Me.

220
00:25:25,983 --> 00:25:28,475
All right.

221
00:25:32,615 --> 00:25:35,173
Now,

222
00:25:38,655 --> 00:25:43,210
please close your eyes. Please all of you
close your eyes.

223
00:25:43,411 --> 00:25:49,229
There's no mesmerism. So please close your
eyes.

224
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:30,111
First put your left hand towards Me

225
00:26:30,312 --> 00:26:37,236
and right hand on top of your head
on the fontanel bone area,

226
00:26:37,437 --> 00:26:40,670
left hand towards Me.

227
00:26:43,045 --> 00:26:45,778
Now,

228
00:26:47,035 --> 00:26:50,529
put the right hand towards Me

229
00:26:52,776 --> 00:27:02,886
and put the left hand on top of your head
not touching the head, above.

230
00:27:09,498 --> 00:27:16,097
Not both the hands, one on top of your
head, only one.

231
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:21,480
Keep your eyes shut.

232
00:27:29,304 --> 00:27:31,692
Now,

233
00:27:32,921 --> 00:27:38,349
all those who are feeling cool breeze
in your hand

234
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:43,833
try to see that it comes on top of your
hand, not below.

235
00:27:44,034 --> 00:27:46,948
If it is coming below just push it up.

236
00:27:47,149 --> 00:27:51,512
You can open your eyes and see.

237
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:06,679
First, put both your hands towards Me
again,

238
00:28:08,074 --> 00:28:12,955
see, if you are feeling a cool breeze
in your hands

239
00:28:13,156 --> 00:28:18,824
or you are feeling a cool breeze coming
out of your head.

240
00:28:19,025 --> 00:28:26,693
Could be hot, could be hot. If it is hot,
try to forgive people.

241
00:28:27,009 --> 00:28:31,162
Could be hot but doesn't matter.

242
00:28:52,998 --> 00:29:01,825
All those who have felt cool or hot breeze
coming into their hands

243
00:29:02,026 --> 00:29:06,009
or out of their fontanel bone area,

244
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:11,184
please raise your hands, both your hands.

245
00:29:12,315 --> 00:29:15,339
Don't be afraid.

246
00:29:32,297 --> 00:29:38,560
Most of you, most of you have felt it.

247
00:29:39,472 --> 00:29:42,947
May God bless you.

248
00:29:46,179 --> 00:29:52,934
How many of you have not felt, please
raise your hands.

249
00:30:00,635 --> 00:30:03,983
Hardly any.

250
00:30:12,166 --> 00:30:20,725
Very surprising. Very happy to see that
most of you have felt the cool breeze.

251
00:30:20,926 --> 00:30:24,594
May God bless you.

252
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:28,428
Thank you very much.
