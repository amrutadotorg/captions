00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:11,030
[Voice off]: Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi, the
most important spiritual figure in the world

2
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:12,080
today.

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:37,120
Please join us on a special program of “Audrey
Hope’s real women”

4
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:45,800
Interviewer: My name is Audrey Hopes and welcome
to ‘Real women”.

5
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:51,270
It is a great honour to be in the presence
of the most important spiritual figure in

6
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:54,829
the world today, Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi.

7
00:00:54,829 --> 00:01:00,890
Shri Mataji is a world leader and has travelled
the globe many times over to give Self Realization

8
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:02,789
to thousands.

9
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:08,440
Self Realization is the pure connexion with
our spiritual nature and is the only hope

10
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:11,190
for a stable society.

11
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:15,370
Today is that day prophesized by the saints.

12
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:19,160
Once you may have needed to travel to the
Himalayas or to meditate on a mountain for

13
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:24,630
twenty years, but now, through the grace of
Shri Mataji, there is a simple way to achieve

14
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:28,280
that connexion and that is through Sahaja
Yoga.

15
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:34,510
Shri Mataji founded Sahaja Yoga as a method
for human beings to experience the truth within

16
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:36,090
and to become your own master.

17
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:41,640
Shri Mataji is a mother and a grandmother,
a true role model for all human beings.

18
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,710
Shri Mataji was a spiritual guide for Mahatma
Gandhi.

19
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:52,570
She accepts no money for Realization and she
says the truth cannot be paid for.

20
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:57,880
She joins us after her fourth visit to the
United Nations and before her journey to Washington

21
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:58,900
DC.

22
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:01,860
Shri Mataji is known all over the world.

23
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,960
She is less known in the United States.

24
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:09,990
Well, it is here, in the mist of media and
its power, where she is needed the most.

25
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:13,170
Shri Mataji, we are deeply honoured to have
you here, thank you.

26
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:15,110
Shri Mataji: Thank you very much.

27
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:21,420
Interviewer: I’d like to begin by speaking
about Self Realization and to tell the viewers

28
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:23,530
what Self Realization is.

29
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:33,560
Shri Mataji: Within yourself lies a power
which is called in Sanskrit language as Kundalini,

30
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,000
which is in the sacrum bone.

31
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:44,569
That means definitely, that the Greeks knew
this was a sacred bone where that power was

32
00:02:44,569 --> 00:02:45,569
lying.

33
00:02:45,569 --> 00:02:51,860
This is the power which connects you to the
All-pervading Power.

34
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:59,860
Now the truth is that we are not this body,
this mind, this ego, these conditionings.

35
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:08,230
But you are the pure Spirit because you say:
“My ego, my body”, you are the pure Spirit,

36
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:10,220
this is one truth about yourself.

37
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:16,090
Another truth is that there is the All-pervading
Power of divine love.

38
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:18,850
It’s called by various names.

39
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:22,819
You see these beautiful flowers; it’s a
miracle itself.

40
00:03:22,819 --> 00:03:24,680
And who runs our heart?

41
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:29,880
We never inquire, we don’t find by doctors
will tell you it’s the autonomous nervous

42
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:30,880
system.

43
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,890
But who is this “auto”?

44
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:40,650
So these two things we have to realize that
we are the pure Spirit and there is an All-pervading

45
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:43,130
Power of divine love.

46
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:45,960
Power of love, not of hatred.

47
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,690
Interviewer: How does one receive Self Realization?

48
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:55,190
Does a person have to give up their personal
life or self problems before they can attain

49
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:56,190
this?

50
00:03:56,190 --> 00:04:00,870
Shri Mataji: It’s very simple, that within
our being, a complete machinery is already

51
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:03,530
made through our evolutionary process.

52
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:13,100
And we have seven centres, main seven centres
placed on our central nervous system, or we

53
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:23,330
can call it on the parasympathetic and ultimately,
this power raises, penetrates through these

54
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:32,449
six centres only, ultimately, pierces through
the fontanel bone area and connects you to

55
00:04:32,449 --> 00:04:34,749
that All-pervading Power.

56
00:04:34,749 --> 00:04:42,580
While it is travelling through these charkas
or the centres or the energy centres we can

57
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:45,830
call them, it nourishes them.

58
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:51,960
Not only it nourishes, it integrates them
and it enlightens them.

59
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:56,539
Most of the problems, global problems, are
because of human beings.

60
00:04:56,539 --> 00:05:00,789
And most of the human problems are because
of these centres.

61
00:05:00,789 --> 00:05:07,370
Because these centres cater to our physical,
mental, emotional and spiritual needs.

62
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:14,949
So once these centres are out of gear, we
have all these problems whether on an individual

63
00:05:14,949 --> 00:05:17,499
basis or on a collective basis.

64
00:05:17,499 --> 00:05:28,900
So when this connects to the All-pervading
Power, then you achieve a new state of awareness.

65
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,780
So there’s a breakthrough in your evolution.

66
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:33,949
Evolution process is spontaneous.

67
00:05:33,949 --> 00:05:38,139
We have not paid for it, we didn’t do anything,
we are becoming human beings.

68
00:05:38,139 --> 00:05:41,449
So now, the last one, why should we pay for
it?

69
00:05:41,449 --> 00:05:43,759
Or why should we do anything about it?

70
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:49,660
Interviewer: Does one need blind faith or
can this be approached as you say, or how

71
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,180
is it approached like a science?

72
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,210
Shri Mataji: It’s just a living process.

73
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:58,960
You try to understand this way, that this
Mother earth is there.

74
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:03,009
What we have to do is to put one seed in it
and the seed sprouts.

75
00:06:03,009 --> 00:06:04,009
How?

76
00:06:04,009 --> 00:06:09,430
Because it is built in, in the seed to sprout
and built in, in the Mother Earth to make

77
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:10,430
it sprout.

78
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,400
It’s as simple as that.

79
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,349
Interviewer: We Americans are very into scientific
proof.

80
00:06:16,349 --> 00:06:21,379
[Laughter]
And you describe Sahaja Yoga as an essence

81
00:06:21,379 --> 00:06:26,160
of all religions and not just a religion.

82
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,439
How is Sahaja Yoga different?

83
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:29,090
Shri Mataji: “Saha” means “with”.

84
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:31,110
“Ja” means born.

85
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:37,460
Born with you is the right to have this union,
the Yoga.

86
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:40,069
That is Sahaja Yoga.

87
00:06:40,069 --> 00:06:50,839
By this union, you realize that all the religions
were flowers born on one tree of spirituality.

88
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:55,349
But we have plucked the flowers and now we
are fighting with the dead flowers.

89
00:06:55,349 --> 00:07:05,349
If there is one God then why could we-how
could we fight in the name of God?

90
00:07:05,349 --> 00:07:07,610
This is the philosophy of Gandhiji also.

91
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:16,800
We also followed the same philosophy not only
but, as we worship all the incarnations and

92
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:22,479
all the prophets and all messiahs, in the
same way, he said we have to worship them.

93
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:27,569
It’s not just to show respect but you must
worship the same way.

94
00:07:27,569 --> 00:07:36,229
That is Sahaj religion which encompasses all
the religions and also respects because in

95
00:07:36,229 --> 00:07:38,690
essence all of them are the same.

96
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:45,180
And if there is one singular message in all
these religions is that: “Seek your Self

97
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,860
to be born again”.

98
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:49,559
That’s the message in all the religions.

99
00:07:49,559 --> 00:07:56,149
Interviewer: So where has the religion gone
wrong?

100
00:07:56,149 --> 00:08:01,479
We are- let’s take Christianity for example.

101
00:08:01,479 --> 00:08:09,679
Shri Mataji: Christianity has gone wrong at
a very early stage I should say, where it

102
00:08:09,679 --> 00:08:13,129
was taken over by Paul.

103
00:08:13,129 --> 00:08:18,740
I asked my father when I first saw his name
in the Bible, I said: “Who is this Mister

104
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:19,740
Paul?”

105
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,689
He said: “He is a squatter.

106
00:08:21,689 --> 00:08:23,740
He had nothing to do with Christ.

107
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:26,149
He never met Christ.

108
00:08:26,149 --> 00:08:31,059
He had actually killed so many Christians,
he has killed the disciple of Christ called

109
00:08:31,059 --> 00:08:32,059
Steven.

110
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:39,589
But being a bureaucrat, he thought it was
a good platform to jump onto the platform

111
00:08:39,589 --> 00:08:41,180
of Christianity.

112
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:44,529
And he had to have help from somebody, one
of the disciples.

113
00:08:44,529 --> 00:08:50,569
The worse disciple of Christ was Peter, so
he grabbed Peter and has written the Bible”.

114
00:08:50,569 --> 00:08:58,540
Despite all the things they have done, that
Christ told Peter that “Satan will catch

115
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:02,750
hold of you’ it’s clearly said.

116
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:08,529
Now this Mister Peter and Mister Paul put
together tried to spoil all the great work

117
00:09:08,529 --> 00:09:16,600
of our Lord Jesus-Christ because, first of
all, the worst for women.

118
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:20,330
Paul hated women from his heart.

119
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:24,980
And that’s why even for Christ’s Mother,
he uses a word like “woman”.

120
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,779
To us, she is a Goddess.

121
00:09:26,779 --> 00:09:29,250
She is a Mahalakshmi, to Sahaja Yogis.

122
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:31,540
But to him, she was just a woman.

123
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:39,190
And the way he has conducted the whole thing
has brought such a disaster on the women of

124
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:42,080
the West.

125
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:48,800
Even now, up till now, women are treated as
something very low for spirituality.

126
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:53,420
But in India, a woman is the shakti, is the
power.

127
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:59,540
Another great mistake they have committed
is in describing the Trinity.

128
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:11,010
We have God the father, God the son and the
third one is a Holy Ghost, is a dove.

129
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:16,129
How can you have a father and a son and no
mother?

130
00:10:16,129 --> 00:10:24,180
But there is a Primordial Mother which was
accepted by all the religions even the Jews

131
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:26,340
had it.

132
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:28,680
Greeks called it Athena.

133
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,600
“Atha” in Sanskrit means “primordial”.

134
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,600
Athena.

135
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,880
In India, this is called as Adi Shakti.

136
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:41,130
In every religion, they had this Mother who
was the Primordial Mother.

137
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:50,490
So he cancelled all the powers of a mother
and that is how the women have a very inferiority

138
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:54,410
complex, I think, or insecurity in the Western
world.

139
00:10:54,410 --> 00:11:02,519
Because they think we have to, all the time,
be apologetical [unsure] and we should always

140
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:08,209
serve the men and we should sell our body,
we should make ourselves very attractive,

141
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:10,510
otherwise, we have no place!

142
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:14,569
And that is how the morality of women is shattered.

143
00:11:14,569 --> 00:11:18,230
Interviewer: I wanted to use a quote from
that [pensée?

144
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:21,940
French word?] in “Timothy 1” to really
emphasise this point.

145
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:25,370
It says in the Bible, “A woman should learn
in quietness and full submission.

146
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:31,540
I do not present a woman to teach or to have
authority over a man; she must be silent.

147
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:33,640
For Adam was formed first, then Eve.

148
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:37,769
And Adam was not the one deceived; it was
the woman who was deceived and became a sinner.

149
00:11:37,769 --> 00:11:38,769
[The New Testament, 1 Timothy 2:9-14]

150
00:11:38,769 --> 00:11:41,940
Shri Mataji: That’s also a mistake about
Adam and Eve also.

151
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,709
But that, I’ll deal later on.

152
00:11:43,709 --> 00:11:51,269
But a simple thing is that it was a complete
attack on womanhood.

153
00:11:51,269 --> 00:11:56,689
And that’s how women have accepted- imagine
such a developed country like England, was

154
00:11:56,689 --> 00:12:00,800
discussing till yesterday, whether a woman
should preach or not.

155
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,800
Yes!

156
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:07,170
I mean, now, with great difficulty, some people
have agreed that women should preach.

157
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:08,480
I just don’t understand.

158
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,410
In India, a woman is very powerful.

159
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:15,050
She doesn’t care for her husband if he goes
after another woman.

160
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:18,190
She says: “Alright, he’s sinful, let him
go to Hell.

161
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:19,190
I don’t care."

162
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:23,380
She stands on her own merit on her chastity.

163
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:25,250
She doesn’t bother.

164
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:33,410
Now, the whole situation is so bad, that women
have to be, all the time, trying to, you see,

165
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:35,870
expose their body also.

166
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:40,069
I haven’t seen a single film in which a
man is exposed.

167
00:12:40,069 --> 00:12:46,329
It’s always the women [who] must be exposed
as if men are some Sanctum sanctorum.

168
00:12:46,329 --> 00:12:52,240
I feel the slavery of women is much more in
the West than in India.

169
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,530
Interviewer: And how about the Koran?

170
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:58,149
I’m speaking about the Iranians.

171
00:12:58,149 --> 00:13:03,610
I know you did a programme this week and it
was a very important programme.

172
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:08,819
And I’d like to talk about how the Iranian
people have misinterpreted Mohamed and the

173
00:13:08,819 --> 00:13:13,350
effects on their society and the importance
of their changing for women.

174
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:14,350
[unsure]

175
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:15,350
Shri Mataji: Yes.

176
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:18,649
Even Muhammad Sahib, you see, he respected
women so much.

177
00:13:18,649 --> 00:13:20,370
You know, they used to have wars.

178
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:21,370
They were tribes.

179
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:22,649
They were tribal people.

180
00:13:22,649 --> 00:13:26,959
It was only Muhammad Sahib who could take
birth in those horrible Arabs.

181
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:32,170
And he found that so many men, young men were
killed.

182
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:33,439
So he said: “Alright.

183
00:13:33,439 --> 00:13:39,690
If there are not young men, let the old men
marry, even young girl.

184
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:41,079
It doesn’t matter but marry.

185
00:13:41,079 --> 00:13:46,670
Even if they have to marry five times, marry
so that they do not become prostitutes.

186
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:52,009
Just to respect their chastity he prescribed
this thing but it is not compulsory that you

187
00:13:52,009 --> 00:13:53,279
should marry five times.

188
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,879
You see, we have horrible things in India.

189
00:13:56,879 --> 00:14:02,410
A man marries four times, has eight children
each time because they believe that but that

190
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:04,600
democracy [demography?], they’ll be powerful.

191
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:12,129
Then, after some time, they divorce their
wives by saying three times: “Talaq, talaq,

192
00:14:12,129 --> 00:14:13,129
talaq."

193
00:14:13,129 --> 00:14:14,129
[repudiation].

194
00:14:14,129 --> 00:14:17,920
Now, these women are with so many children,
are just left on the street.

195
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:26,420
And if you see them you’ll think that this
is worse than Somalia.

196
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:27,939
He respected women!

197
00:14:27,939 --> 00:14:33,689
Not only, he told his wife that: “You are
going to work out- Aicha” he told her: “You

198
00:14:33,689 --> 00:14:37,620
are going to work out something against the
religion."

199
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:44,490
And really it was wrong on her because his
own daughter, as you know her name was Fatima,

200
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:48,649
stood up and said that: “This, never Muhammad
Sahib has said it."

201
00:14:48,649 --> 00:14:56,430
But this Abu-Bakr is a fellow who just took
the platform, as it is, I should say, instead

202
00:14:56,430 --> 00:15:01,019
of his own son in law, Hazrat Ali, who was
a great Realized soul.

203
00:15:01,019 --> 00:15:10,499
And he just completely changed the ideas about
women which Fatima was going to tell.

204
00:15:10,499 --> 00:15:17,699
So there were big wars called Karbala in which
two children of Fatimabi were killed, Hazrat

205
00:15:17,699 --> 00:15:24,459
Ali was also killed and there two groups which
were formed, one is Shia and Sunni.

206
00:15:24,459 --> 00:15:31,129
But Shias also don’t understand that they
have to respect their women because Fatimabi

207
00:15:31,129 --> 00:15:34,860
herself was a, not only a saint but an incarnation.

208
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,860
She was a Goddess.

209
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:43,360
Interviewer: How has the media affected our
view of women today?

210
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:50,920
Shri Mataji: In the Western media I must say
that women are used just to lure or some sort

211
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:56,680
of a very low type of human beings I should
say.

212
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,850
Men are not sex points.

213
00:15:58,850 --> 00:15:59,889
They are the Spirit.

214
00:15:59,889 --> 00:16:03,700
They are reduced to this sex point by Freud.

215
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:08,980
And Freud was like a Christ here once upon
a time.

216
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:14,059
Now of course, after so many years, I said
this at least twenty years back.

217
00:16:14,059 --> 00:16:20,480
But now it is appearing, many- I’ve seen
some books like “Fall of Freudian Empire”

218
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,629
“Freudian Freud”, so many books are coming
now!

219
00:16:23,629 --> 00:16:25,670
Already all the harm has been done!

220
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:32,350
Human beings are reduced to a sex point now
by media and women who are very cheap who

221
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:40,920
can expose their body and can sell their chastity
are regarded as great heroines.

222
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:41,920
This is what?

223
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,589
It’s the situation of the media that is
today.

224
00:16:43,589 --> 00:16:47,790
Interviewer: I heard you have even said that
Freud can only prosper in America.

225
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:48,899
Shri Mataji: Hum?

226
00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:50,529
Interviewer: Freud can only prosper in America.

227
00:16:50,529 --> 00:16:51,529
Shri Mataji: Yes.

228
00:16:51,529 --> 00:16:52,529
Interviewer: You said that.

229
00:16:52,529 --> 00:16:53,529
Shri Mataji: It’s a fact.

230
00:16:53,529 --> 00:16:58,620
He was born in Austria and when I talked against
Freud they all clapped.

231
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:01,999
They were very happy I said so because they
were quite ashamed about him.

232
00:17:01,999 --> 00:17:10,560
But even in Austria, you find so many prostitutes
on the streets, standing all the while.

233
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:14,589
But here, at least, there it is, the housewives
are housewives.

234
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:19,490
Here, even housewife has to dress up in such
a way that she should be like a prostitute.

235
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:21,760
Why should you do that?

236
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,760
You must have your self-respect.

237
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:28,870
Interviewer: How is this special time for
women?

238
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:37,670
Shri Mataji: I call it this a Blossom time
because I say they are many flowers, so many

239
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:45,090
some of them are on the Earth and they are
to become now fruits.

240
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:52,580
But it’s called as Qiyamah in the Koran,
meaning the Resurrection time.

241
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:59,310
Even in the Indian scriptures, we have this
Resurrection time and by many astrologers,

242
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:05,680
thousands of years back, it was predicted
that such and such time will come.

243
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:09,710
And also in the Bible, it is the Last Judgement.

244
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:17,570
There’s another stupid idea which we find
in Bible and also in Koran, which is very

245
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:22,840
stupid, and I think also- I don’t know about
the Torah, but they said that there is also

246
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:28,910
the same idea previously – that, at the
time of Resurrection our dead bodies will

247
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:32,030
come out of the graves and then they’ll
ascend.

248
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:36,540
Now, tell Me what is left in the grave of
the dead bodies?

249
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:40,280
It is so absurd, it’s so illogical.

250
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:44,810
Actually, in that way, I would say Indian
scriptures said the correct thing that at

251
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:51,370
this time of Kali Yuga all the souls which
are lost, all the souls who want their Realization,

252
00:18:51,370 --> 00:19:01,310
all the souls who have been thinking of God
and seeking God all over the world, will be

253
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:02,310
reborn.

254
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:05,290
That’s why we have a population problem.

255
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:10,740
That is why all kinds of horrible people are
also born.

256
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:14,340
In this time, about twenty years back, your
media was much better.

257
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:17,630
They didn’t show such horrible scenes.

258
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:21,360
I mean they must show bedroom’s scenes,
what is the need?

259
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,420
Bathroom scenes.

260
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:27,400
I mean, if somebody comes into your house,
do you take them to your bedroom, into your

261
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,480
bathroom or you keep them in the dining room?

262
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:32,060
I mean, it’s private life.

263
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:34,380
They have no respect for privacy.

264
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:41,800
Now, you see, this kind of funny idea that
we are going to get out of the graves and

265
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:48,580
all that is still lingering in the mind of
many ignorant Christians and also Muslims.

266
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:52,380
One Bosnia fellow met Me, he was Muslim.

267
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:56,450
I asked him: “Why were you dying there,
what was the need to die?”

268
00:19:56,450 --> 00:20:00,400
He said: “Because if we die now in the name
of God, we’ll be resurrected."

269
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,400
[Interviewer is laughing.]

270
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:06,800
Shri Mataji: I mean it is relevant from the
idea of Bible, you see?

271
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:13,750
So this is what it is that these ideas are
to be put right.

272
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:18,710
In the west, you see, we have Christianity,
we have other religions.

273
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:26,710
But, I would say that the roots of the spiritual
knowledge, it’s more in India.

274
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:30,080
I’m myself born in a Christian religion.

275
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:37,300
But the roots about it, the explanation about
it, is much better discovered in India because

276
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:42,450
it’s an ancient country which has been all
the times seeking, seeking, for thousands

277
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:46,150
of years.

278
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:50,010
Now the system that is Sahaja Yoga as you
mentioned is not mine.

279
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:52,550
It’s an ancient system.

280
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:58,680
But we had this system in the Nath Panthis,
they call it, that they were in the centre.

281
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:04,080
And one master will have only one disciple,
this was the tradition.

282
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:09,290
So there were very few people who got their
Realization.

283
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:15,260
Shri Rama’s father-in-law’s guru was Ashtavakra.

284
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:16,700
He has written about sahaj.

285
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:26,220
But he has just described what happens when
you get into the state of Spirit.

286
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:31,920
This father-in-law, Janaka, gave Realization
to only one person Natchiketa according to

287
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,920
the tradition.

288
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:42,410
But, on the twelve century, there was a great
poet in India, in Maharashtra, born as Gnyaneshwara,

289
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:47,250
who asked his guru, his own brother that:
“Let me also tell about this."

290
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:49,570
He said: “All right”.

291
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:51,160
He permitted.

292
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:58,170
So in his Gnyaneshwari which is just the explanation
of Gita, he has clearly said in the sixth

293
00:21:58,170 --> 00:22:04,350
chapter about Kundalini, how she rises, how
she gives you Realization and everything.

294
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:11,080
But those people who were in charge of religion,
as usual, didn’t know how to do it.

295
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:16,580
So what they did, they said:” This is “nisidhat”
[forbid] – means, cancelled- you don’t

296
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:17,870
read this sixth chapter."

297
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:19,480
So nobody would read that chapter.

298
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:23,910
That’s how it went into background!

299
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:34,290
So I would say, after that, many great saints
like Guru Nanak, Kabir, Sukarama, Ramdas,

300
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:41,270
in the sixteen century, did a great work of
Kundalini [inaudible].

301
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:45,800
Even in the Bible, it is: “I will appear
before you as tongues of flames."

302
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,590
“Tree of life” so many things are described!

303
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:54,420
But in the little time that they had, they
could not explain so much.

304
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:59,000
Now, these people have talked about Kundalini
and said about it.

305
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:08,000
If I have done any work, is this, that by
studying through human beings, I met many

306
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,880
people because my father was a very social
man and my husband was in a position where

307
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,270
I met many people.

308
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:22,820
I studied human beings and I found out a method
by which you can now give a-mass Realization.

309
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:30,040
In Russia, in Bulgaria, Romania, we always
have people in the stadium, not less than

310
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:34,920
sixteen thousand, and they all get their Realization!

311
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:38,540
And they are very sensitive to spirituality
and they stick to it.

312
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:41,000
None of these false gurus could stick there.

313
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,290
Interviewer: Psychics, the issue of psychics,
it’s so popular here!

314
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:49,140
And we are very-it’s very dangerous.

315
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:50,630
Could you explain what can happen?

316
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:51,870
Shri Mataji: Ah.

317
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:55,140
Americans are very simple people I must say.

318
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:59,370
First time I came for parapsychology, they
took Me into a hall of parapsychology.

319
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:03,010
They told Me: “You are dealing with dead
spirits!”

320
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:05,350
And they were very angry with Me.

321
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:07,840
He says that: “You come as guest and why
do crusade?

322
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,840
[unsure]."

323
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,280
I said: “I have to tell you the truth, I
am your Mother.

324
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,870
I’m not your guest, you didn’t pay for
Me.

325
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:17,750
I came on my own, coming on my vehicle and
going on my vehicle”, while they made money

326
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:18,750
out of Me.

327
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:20,840
So, they don’t like it.

328
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:27,580
When I first came here, when I told them that:
“These are all spirits and psychic things

329
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:29,990
and don’t do it”, they didn’t like it.

330
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:31,810
Interviewer: How can we know of false guru?

331
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:38,100
Shri Mataji: First of all, you cannot pay
for your Self Realization!

332
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,130
Or for any knowledge.

333
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:41,630
You must value your life.

334
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:46,600
If you don’t value your life, then you’ll
go to all such stupid people and you’ll

335
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,600
waste your time.

336
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:53,830
No, if you value you life, if you value your
money for example, you’ll first find out

337
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:55,900
what it this you are buying.

338
00:24:55,900 --> 00:25:04,160
First of all you must see the disciples, what
are they doing, what is their style what are

339
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,280
they gaining, what is their knowledge.

340
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,140
First the disciples!

341
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:10,360
Most of them are recluses.

342
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:14,860
Anything which is sort of fashionable, people
want to do.

343
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:18,430
You talk of individuality, all right?

344
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:22,660
Any entrepreneur, now they just started a
six inches of skirt, everybody wears six inches

345
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:23,800
of skirt!

346
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:27,360
Otherwise you are not “in”, means in the
lunatic asylum.

347
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:34,410
So like that, these people are good at big
advertisement, marketing, writing books, all

348
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:35,410
falsehood!

349
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:41,980
You believe them because they have a knack,
advertisement is the main thing which has

350
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:48,100
led to this kind of things and Americans are
really very sensitive to advertising.

351
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:50,550
If anything is advertised, they think it’s
great.

352
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:56,880
Also I was surprised when I came here, they
asked Me – in Boston, I remember- they asked

353
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,470
Me: “How many Roll Royce you have?”, in
the television.

354
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:01,940
I said: “I don’t have!”

355
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:04,510
They said then: “You don’t make any money."

356
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:05,510
“No."

357
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:06,510
I said: “I don’t make any money."

358
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:07,510
“So there’s no business."

359
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:08,510
“No”, I said “no”.

360
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:09,510
“Then we are not interested."

361
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:12,650
They wouldn’t have Me on the television.

362
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:19,010
I mean you are so money oriented that tomorrow
you’ll purchase God also I think.

363
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:22,520
So, first of all, you cannot pay for it.

364
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:27,930
Second, you must see the disciples, what sort
of disciples they are, what they are, how

365
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:32,850
much they are talking about the knowledge.

366
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:34,400
They must have the knowledge.

367
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:47,720
Now you know very well, and people can find
out that in Sahaja Yoga people just get Realization

368
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:50,400
and start giving Realizations to others.

369
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,510
So many diseases have been cured.

370
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:54,760
It’s a fact, there’s a book written.

371
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,160
Interviewer: So we are in a new stage, a new
evolution.

372
00:26:56,160 --> 00:27:01,490
Shri Mataji: Of course, this is the time,
if you miss it, you’ll miss it for ever!

373
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:06,990
Because, you see, otherwise, you see in America,
people are getting destroyed from within.

374
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:13,120
All kinds of diseases, psychological problems,
this, that, stress, this, that, all kind of

375
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,630
things are going on.

376
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:19,190
Now, to stop it, better ascend above all these
things.

377
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:21,820
Interviewer: Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi.

378
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:52,300
Please join us for part two of this special
program on “Audrey Hope’s real women”.
