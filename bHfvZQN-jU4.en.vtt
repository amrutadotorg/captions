00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:57.892
1985-0701 Press Conference Brussels Belgium DP-RAW

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.892
Shri Mataji: How do we start, am I suppose to say something about Kundalini?

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.892
Yogi: Yes Shri Mataji we would like to know   Shri Mataji Hmm Yogi: By your voice something about

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:18.892
Shri Mataji: You have told them already? I can I think they can ask me questions if you have already told them they know of the subject

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:31.892
Journalists discussing something among themselves Shri Mataji: Beg your pardon Journalist: says something Shri Mataji: Me?

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:40.892
Journalist: They would like to hear from you Shri Mataji

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:50.892
Shri Mataji: I see, I don’t know how what he has told you,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:02:06.892
but I have come here to tell you about something that may be good for all our problems in the west.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:22.892
The western mind has grown just like a tree has grown outside, without going into the roots,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:42.892
so the outgrown tree has to know about the roots, and thus we are waiting for a shock.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:52.892
Recently I have been to America and I feel that the danger to America is not from outside but from inside.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:20.892
They have been indulging into things without knowing what relationship it has to the whole,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:47.892
so the need of today is to know why we have these maladies. Where are we going?

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:11.892
I have been searching within human beings the problem in a different way, inside them,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:25.892
I did my medicine and just to talk to `doctors and through meditative methods penetrating,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:40.892
I tried to find out why human beings are diverted from real reality.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:52.892
There are two categories of human beings actually, only two.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:02.892
One category who has human awareness, human awareness,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:20.892
and the other category is a special category I call it, who can be called as people who are realised souls,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:31.892
(they all understand English that’s good).

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:38.892
This is a special category which is mentioned in all the religions, by all the prophets,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:57.892
everyone has talked about this date, Tao, Zen, Buddha, Mahavira, Christ of course, everyone has talked about it.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:16.892
What is gone wrong with religions is that, that they have not tried to find out their spirit,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.892
the essence of it, they lost the point?

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:42.892
Now supposing if there is something called as spiritual awareness or a super awareness,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.892
supposing, take a hypothesis, you have to keep your mind open as scientists.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:02.892
If what I am saying if I can prove it to you, then you accept it but don’t keep your mind closed.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:23.892
Even scientists are very much conditioned by science.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:31.892
Science is a mental projection, it’s just a mental projection and whatever is in the nature that is what they discover,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:39.892
they cannot create even a stone, we cannot create even a stone.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:50.892
They must accept, we can analyse, we can find out whatever is in nature

00:07:51.000 --> 00:08:00.892
but it is just a mental projection which is limited and which is linear.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:07.892
Because of its linear movement it recoils back upon us, it cannot sustain itself,

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.892
so science has produced atom bomb and we are frightened of it,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.892
now computer will produce another problem, one after another we’ll have problems after problems

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:26.892
machines have produced problems, we have acid drinks, the development,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:36.892
the whole economic development ends up into a problem, plastic has produced problems for us.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:57.892
Because we, it is not related to reality

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:11.892
Even when Confucius talked of humanism it was needed at that time when people were lethargic,

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:19.892
but the way people have developed themselves now, without any relationship to reality

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:27.892
or to the whole we have become malignant in a way in for trouble

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:35.892
and the trouble is we are not aware till it blasts off.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.892
Without the transformation of human beings from within not only talking about it,

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:47.892
what we need is a transformation in our awareness,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:56.892
so we have to see with an open mind if it is feasible if it exists with an open mind.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:08.892
I think all thinking people should try to see if there is a possibility or not,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:17.892
if so then we think positively about it, if so, how do we achieve it.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:33.892
It’s a natural process within us built in, a living process

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.892
by which we have become human beings from amoeba stage,

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:45.892
and the second stage whatever if it is so, again I keep it as a hypothesis,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:56.892
has to happen has to happen naturally, has to happen spontaneously.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:15.892
But in the human stage, it is little different from the animal stage, a fish came out of the sea, one fish,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:22.892
then ten followed, then hundreds and then a shoal of fishes followed.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:29.892
But human beings not easy, because they have the freedom to decide,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:37.892
they have freedom and their freedom is to be respected if they have to have ultimate freedom.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:56.892
And very difficult for human beings to accept that anybody can tell them about it, very difficult,

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:07.892
that’s why they crucified Christ, poisoned Mohammed Saheb, tortured Buddha, Mahavira, they cannot accept.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:37.892
When I was born, I tried to really understand human beings, and this big problem that they have,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:48.892
so I thought no use talking about, the best thing is those who are born on the ground

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:55.892
are to be elevated at least on the second or third story so they know there is something beyond.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:04.000
That’s the best way one can manage.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:13.892
But the problem was that here is what you see is the seventh centre, within us the subtle centre was not opened.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:20.892
It was to be opened. Where you get your baptism to actualise not artificial baptism,

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:27.892
it’s a real a baptism (beg your pardon),

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:43.892
so when that happened I could manage the awakening of this dormant energy within us

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.892
which is actually, whatever I am saying you should not take it for granted,

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:54.892
I am again saying with the open mind, it’s the knowledge of the roots.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:05.892
Is the this is the power which expresses the reflection of the Holy Ghost within us.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:19.892
Christ was given hardly three and a half years to talk, it’s no time for Christ to tell all these things,

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:29.892
and they crucified him. For four years I was struggling with seven British hippies

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:36.892
couldn’t do anything with them, because first of all, they do not have the tradition of our seeking,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:42.892
they have no tradition, they have a desire but no tradition, they don’t understand what to seek,

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:52.892
what to achieve, there is no tradition at all, because the tradition is to grow outside not inside inward.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:11.892
And this is like a plumule in a seed, which is to be awakened, it awakens

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:19.892
and pierces through your fontanelle bone area and you can feel the cool breeze coming out of your head you do feel.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.892
It’s an experience, it may happen it may not happen you cannot be guaranteed.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:30.892
but it happened to so many in Europe, I should say so many in America.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:36.892
In India, it is in thousands, thousands because they have the tradition.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:52.892
And it will work very fast in India, I know that very easy to work it out there,

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:58.892
people are not that materialistic, I mean here when I come in the west people say there is poverty,

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.892
we don’t think we are poor I don’t know what makes people think we are poor, which way,

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.892
we are much more generous than any other country people are, very generous people,

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:16.892
you go to an ordinary Indian, he would love to look after you, we are very happy joyous festive people,

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:26.892
here I find everybody so miserable, le miserable. They are satisfied people.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:34.892
What is in matter, do you think you can get joy out of this matter alright a little bit we need for comfort,

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.892
we can sit on the ground in India, we don’t have such bad weather,

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.892
that all the time you have to cover yourself, we can live under a tree

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:55.892
and there is no poverty of the heart. Others are more concerned about our poverty

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:01.892
and also they do not want to think why we are poor because we were aggressed for three hundred years,

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:10.892
at least for three hundred years, you can imagine,

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:19.892
and also left all the funny things of materialism like you will be amazed that

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.892
in my father’s house I had never known locking the houses or theft or bribery we never knew,

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:36.892
all this was left behind by the British. So, we are still suffering the pangs you see of that slavery,

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:47.892
but the Indians as they live in the villages, these are the unknown Indians, they are very different.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:04.892
Because materialism without relationship to the spirit can be very dangerous, we see that we see that.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:17.892
Now you know there are diseases coming up in America and when I went there,

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:25.892
they said to me we have right to destroy ourselves what do you say to that, then I said alright you go ahead with it.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:39.892
The positive attitude towards life if it is lost through materialism is better not to have it.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:45.892
The attitude should be positive, constructive.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:55.892
There’s no love there’s no compassion there’s no heart in the life, people are so frustrated, disgusted, unhappy.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:16.892
Actually, I never had in my mind to come to the west but my husband got elected to this job by

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:22.892
134 nations elected him and I was forced to come to London.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:34.892
That’s how I am here and I see it and I feel it that there are great saints born in this country great people,

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:41.892
great seekers you see those people who are taking now drugs and all that are seekers you must know they are seekers,

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:50.892
very beautiful people they are in heart, very nice people, they are to be saved. It has to be done.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:02.892
In sahaja yoga when it happens you’ll be surprised overnight people have given up drugs, overnight,

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:11.892
overnight, people have been cured of incurable diseases like cancer so many diseases,

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:18.892
but AIDS, we have cured AIDS, you’ll be surprised but,

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:27.892
it is not that we should say that I have cured but this energy which is residual within you when

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:34.892
it awakens it nourishes you, by that nourishment you just get cured physically.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:47.892
Mentally you get peaceful and it is not just talk it is actualization it’s becoming

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.892
that is what every human being can become, a little breakthrough is needed,

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:58.892
that’s how every human being can become that.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:05.892
Now see our political systems are fighting for nothing at all, it’s all mental I think,

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:14.892
like we say somebody is a capitalist, a communist and this and that it is it’s not reality

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:19.892
I would say that I am the greatest capitalist I feel because I know everything about it, I have

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.892
all the powers I am the greatest communist because I must share it,

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:32.892
everything integrates once you become the spirit, everything, all these theories which have failed,

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:41.892
which we think look like just the words become reality when you become the spirit.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:47.892
But one must turn one’s attention to it, it’s very difficult to break

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:56.892
because all our attention is involved into all useless things which are fruitless, joyless pursuits.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:06.892
It is very difficult to turn I mean especially with journalism I find in the west is brought up in a very different manner.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:11.892
I mean if Brussels journalist could do some justice to me I’ll be thankful

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:19.892
but I must say that countries of tradition like Italy have come along

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.892
because they are traditional they understand serenity, they understand auspiciousness,

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:31.892
they understand also holiness, sacredness, still surprisingly.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:48.892
And I am sure one day everybody will pay some attention and you can’t pay for it,

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:54.892
you see how have gurus here this kind of a thing that kind of thing where people make money,

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:59.892
lynch others, is cannot do these things cannot do these things this is so spontaneous it’s your own

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:07.892
this is what you have to get.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:14.892
And for that you cannot be obliged to anyone it is just your own like one light which is enlightened

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:25.892
if it enlightens another candle it doesn’t oblige it is just ready gets it, it’s no obligation nothing.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:30.892
And Mohammed Saheb has specially said about it I must say I don’t know what the Muslims are doing

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:35.892
I mean they are all one better than the other all this fundamentalist better not deal with them,

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:41.892
but He himself has said that at the time of resurrection your hands will speak,

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.892
He has spoken more about resurrection than about doom’s day,

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:49.892
but they want to talk about doomsday because they can frighten people you see and develop their fundamentalism

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:55.892
not only Muslims everybody is like that, and nobody has done justice to their leaders

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:01.892
or to their prophets or to their incarnations nobody has done. They have nothing to do with them,

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:06.892
Christ himself has said, you ‘ll be calling me Christ, Christ I won’t recognize,

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:12.892
He has clearly said, you are to be born again so they certified themselves I am born again

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:21.892
I am baptized you cannot certify like that, you have to be, to be honest one has to be.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.892
A dog cannot certify itself that I am a human being, can it?

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:34.892
Supposing it certifies it cannot be, he has to become.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:40.892
Now you ask me questions because you see the thing is the subject matter is so big

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:45.892
and I have dealt in thousands and thousands of lectures and things and

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.892
so the best thing would be to ask questions about this will be a good idea.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:57.892
Journalist: How did you discover this?

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:03.892
Shri Mataji: You see that I discovered because I have certain methods of doing it.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:10.892
They say supposing somebody is a scientist and you are not a scientist so how can the scientist tell you how did I discover,

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:19.892
but I told you in way that I know how to do it I can know the inside of human being somehow,

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:27.892
but I have that within me what can I do if I have? Alright?

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:40.892
Journalist: What is the difference between what you are telling us and what all the yogis of the tradition

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:47.892
of the world telling this scheme appears to be in all books about yoga.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:53.892
Shri Mataji: No the books you all have read are not traditional none of them is traditional,

00:25:54.000 --> 00:26:01.892
you see about a hundred years back this some new stuff came in, I am amazed at what I tell you

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:07.892
and because the western mind is extrovert and extrovert mind always likes new things,

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.892
anything new, you see you tell them you put a tin on your head they’ll put it,

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:17.892
you tell them you make your hair like this they’ll make it, I mean it’s something new all the time they go to,

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:26.892
whatever you know about the traditional yoga it’s not, if you read Patanjali its very different from what you do in yoga.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:34.892
He never talked of all these asanas you do to that extent, actually it was it is very recent I would not even say hundred years.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:41.892
One fellow went to the Himalayas and was discarded by all the realized souls there.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:49.892
He came down and he started writing about these asanas actually, it is all related to your chakras,

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:59.892
we too use asanas but how, when the kundalini rises we know on what centre it stops,

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:05.892
then we know how to correct that centre, supposing it is a physical problem then you have to do a particular asana,

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:10.892
but supposing you have a problem in the stomach and you do the asana for some other chakra what’s the use?

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:16.892
It’s a science, if you read Patanjali the whole book is like this in Sanskrit language,

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:25.892
it’s not translated in English the whole of it not at all and this one was a long time back,

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.892
fourteen thousand years back they mentioned kundalini,

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:33.892
sixteen thousand I would say Markandya was sixteen thousand years back he mentioned kundalini,

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:40.892
kundalini is the basis but about a hundred years back people started talking about all kind of nonsense.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:45.892
Even in India, westernized Indians are impressed by all these kind of things. I went to Puna,

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:49.892
I was surprised people were having paralysis this that.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:55.892
I said that how is it you have got all these problems, people said ah our guru has taught us all this.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:57.892
What is your guru? What did he tell you?

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:02.892
They gave me names like Shaktipaya, Taruopaya, Darunopaya, this that, I said

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:06.892
I never heard of where did you learn this thing. They gave me one book,

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:11.892
which was written only seventy years back by some crazy fellow,

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:16.892
which is not mentioned anywhere in the thing, I mean

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.892
if you read even Adi Shankaracharya he has talked about it, Chaitanya lahari and all,

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:28.892
but that’s the sixth century. Kabira, now Kabira is much later, Nanaka throughout,

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:36.892
but how people can change it into something funny you see like the Greeks changed all the Gods

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:43.892
into something stupid like Kabira talked of this as a surati, called it as surati,

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:49.892
this kundalini as surati. Kabira called, but do you know when he was born in Bihar

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:57.892
they called tobacco as surati now what do you say to that.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:03.892
Christ has talked about it, even Bible, I will appear before you like tongues of flames

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:09.892
He has said about the tree of fire, this is the same thing.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:17.892
But according to time people have talked this was a secret knowledge for quite some time in India,

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:26.892
but it became quite an eloquent I think at the time of Adi Shankaracharya to begin with

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.892
but Kabira and Nanaka have already said it clearly. What about the Sikhs?

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:36.892
Do they know anything about it? It’s all they read from one page to another in two and a half hours the whole thing they can read.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:42.892
But they miss all the points, you see reading is not the way to know it. It has to happen.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:46.892
Like supposing you have a headache and I say you take Anacin

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:51.892
and you go on reading I take Anacin I take Anacin will it, it will work out?

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:56.892
So the knowledge that you have got about yoga books is only about hundred years old

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:02.892
which I don’t know from where it has come, when I read it I am amazed and I have read ,

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:06.892
seen such a thick book written on kundalini that the kundalini is in the stomach ,

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:12.892
it is not you can see at the times sometimes in some people when the centre of nabhi

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:17.892
or the centre of the solar plexus is under pressure

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:23.892
you can see even the pulsation of the kundalini very clearly on this triangular bone, very clearly,

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:28.892
but I would say even the Greeks knew about it because they called this bone as sacrum,

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:32.892
sacrum meaning sacred, they knew about it

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:41.892
definitely otherwise why did they call this bone sacrum.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:49.892
Athena itself the Ath, Ath means primordial and Athena is the one stands with a snake-like

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:53.892
thing in her hand and with all the centres showing in her hand,

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:57.892
if you see the I have seen the I have been to Greece I know,

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:04.892
but all that was sort of brought down to some sort of a level which I don’t know understand

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:15.892
what should I call it we call it supra-conscious level, it is something on the right-hand side movement.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:21.892
Or the left side movement as we call it as the subconscious or the collective subconscious

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:27.892
because they could not move higher they started giving supra-conscious aa experiences

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:32.892
and the collective subconscious experiences which are very dangerous very dangerous

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:40.892
like parapsychology now, how to convince them it is a collective subconscious entry

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:50.892
which is very dangerous. That cancer is triggered by that, how to tell them?

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:58.892
By entering into the collective sub-conscious, you will be amazed that people are such closed about things

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:03.892
There were four great scientists came to India to talk to me from America

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:10.892
and they wanted to become I don’t know what, they said we want to have that consciousness by which

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.892
you become subtle you can go to moon you can go to the sun.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:18.892
I said why you are already flying in the air why do you want to become that.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:25.892
They said no we want to become subtle personalities to go into the air if I do this. I said but why?

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:32.892
They said because Russians are doing it. I said they are doing wrong they’ll all suffer and you will also suffer.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:38.892
I said who told you this, they gave a name of a journalist in India called Patanjali.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:45.892
I said I am amazed at Patanjali himself because he was suffering from this kind of a disease,

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:51.892
and his wife came to me and I cured him now do you want me to put the disease into you.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:59.892
It’s very dangerous to play about with the subconscious and the collective subconscious

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.892
or supra-conscious or the collective supra-conscious.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.892
You are lost you do not know what you are doing.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:09.892
That’s what some of these false and fake gurus and all these people

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:17.892
who are very powerful here are using that mesmerism, ESP all this is the same.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:28.892
Thank God now we have published a book in French which you can see yourself and read.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:37.892
Yes Journalist: Difference between what you are doing and certain other eastern religions in the west is that you don’t ask money

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:43.892
Shri Mataji: No no no how can you pay money? How can you pay money for? Now say

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.892
I am saying it’s a living process let be wise about it,

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:52.892
now If it’s the mother earth she is sprouting a seed, do we pay anything to the mother earth?

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:59.892
Do we? And be wise about it how can you pay for it? It is invaluable,

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.892
how much did we pay to become human beings from the monkey stage? Did we pay?

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.892
Let’s take it that way, I mean I am asking you a simple question.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:15.892
It’s a living process how can you pay for it?

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:23.892
I, at the most you can pay for my ticket to the aero for the aeroplane, at the most I mean

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:27.892
if you have to pay anything that you can pay?

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.892
Journalist: You are too rich Shri Mataji: Beg your pardon Journalist: You are too rich

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:40.892
Shri Mataji: Luckily this time I am born in a rich family. I come from a royal family in India

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:47.892
which has a calendar and also my husband is quite well off and a generous man and he believes,

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:51.892
he believes that that’s the only way it can work out, he believes in Sahaja yoga,

00:34:52.000 --> 00:35:02.892
he is a great sustenance for me. I live alright and you will also live alright.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:08.892
For this, you don’t have to pay.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:15.892
Krishna has said “Yog kashem vahameyam” when you get yoga real union, He looks after you

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:20.892
and wellbeing everything physical, mental, emotional, even material.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:39:57.892
Because you become such a satisfied soul also, now as you see me,

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:40.892
a mini palace sort of a place may be, well I can live anywhere, I can live on the street

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:45.892
I can live in the jungles, this body of mine is very good it doesn’t trouble me at all

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:56.892
it’s comfortable anywhere. I am not bothered about what I eat, what I do, not bothered.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:04.892
Comfort is another slavery, I mean those who sit on the chair cannot sit on the ground,

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:12.892
the chair comes on our head, the more we try to be comfortable the worst it is.

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:18.892
But the body can be your slave I mean it’s just it is for you, you are not for the body.

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:27.892
Journalist: But certain others like Bhagwan they do ask money

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:32.892
Shri Mataji: Babba don’t bring these controversial people it is how can it be?

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:39.892
Just tell me how can it be? They ask, let them ask, what to do, they will go with its all wrong,

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:47.892
you are people so naive, why do you give them? You are so naive,

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:58.892
like one fellow came to London and he said if you give me the 59th Rolls Royce then I’ll come, can you imagine,

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:03.892
ninth Rolls Royce, so the poor boy so sweet of them but stupid also,

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:10.892
starved themselves for one year, bought a Rolls Royce for him when this great man came in

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:21.892
and the big journalist of London and everybody was there to take photographs of the Rolls Royce.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:27.892
And when some of the Sahaja yogis approached them they said why you want to give him a Rolls Royce

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:31.892
they said Rolls Royce is a metal we are giving him the metal he gives us the spirit.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:37.892
How can you convert metal into the spirit? Can you?

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:46.892
You are intelligent people you have to tell them that it’s not possible to convert metal into

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:55.892
that’s why they are very angry with me all of them, you see after all you see are all very against me but what to do?

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:03.892
Yes, please Journalist: People do feel themselves

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:13.892
and realize themselves what are the means that like what are the exercises like in the traditional yoga

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:17.892
Shri Mataji: No, No you see there is no exercise it is effortless,

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:25.892
Sahaj, sah means with, sah means with, ja means born, is born with you, no nothing has to be done.

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:36.892
The realization goes into first the step of awakening when the kundalini herself comes up alright.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:45.892
Now the advantage of this is like a lamp which is dirty, or something wrong with the lamp,

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:52.892
if you put a little light in it, it can see for itself, what’s wrong with me alright?

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:58.892
So, you start cleansing yourself, like you become your own guru you become your own master.

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:03.892
But first little light must come, that’s important, that’s the only job I do

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:12.892
the rest of it you look after. You have to become your own guru.

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:28.892
It’s not only I, supposing you get it and you master it, then you, you can do it,

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:35.892
we ‘ve one gentleman in India, he is just a farmer, has given realization to ten thousand people.

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:42.892
Well here is Dr Warren I don’t know how many people he has given realization I don’t keep count of it

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:48.892
because we have no organisation as such, we have no membership nothing of that kind.

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:55.892
We don’t have any organisation as such we have another Doctor here sitting.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:03.000
I come from a rich family so called my husband is rich my house in London could be called as

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:07.892
Journalist: You have centres different? Shri Mataji: Yes centres we have,

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:14.892
but it’s not like the centres that others have, its actually like people when they are living in a place you see,

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:19.892
they pay the rent of the place, they manage I don’t know how they live they share among themselves,

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:28.892
the rent as well as the food and that they call as the centre.

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:34.892
They become so collective and you should see the joy that flows between them,

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:38.892
a person going from here to India and in India the people waiting for him to come a Sahaja yogi

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:42.892
is coming to the whole world becomes your family.

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:46.892
Journalist: Why don’t you call it an ashram? Shri Mataji: Hmm? Beg your pardon

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:52.892
Journalist: Why don’t you call it an ashram?                Why don't you call it an ashram? These centres.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:59.892
Shri Mataji: We do, do call ashram, ashram also we call it, we call it ashram also we call it ashram,

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:04.892
also centres. If it’s a small place where only people can come to visit,

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:10.892
then it is a centre see whatever you may call that makes no difference.

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:19.892
We have ashrams everywhere except here we don’t have but hope to establish one here, we have just a centre.

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:36.892
We have an ashram in Italy where else, we have an ashram in Austria very good ashram,

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:42.892
we have a very good one in Switzerland. In England, we have five of them.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:51.892
France, we have a very nice ashram.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:16.892
It’s not just a lip service it’s an actualization, lip service, just talking about, it’s not just the theory,

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:22.892
it’s just the actualization, because you are that I mean it’s nothing difficult, you are all that,

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:30.892
just you have to have what you have, that’s all, you have to be aware of it that’s all.

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:35.892
It’s so simple that’s why people don’t like it You see if we tell them you can eat like this

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:40.892
no they don’t want to they want to eat this way that way that way (laughs),

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:47.892
what can we do about its very simple has to be because it is so vital like our breathing,

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:52.892
supposing for our breathing you have to read a yoga and go to a guru pay him thousand pounds,

00:42:53.000 --> 00:43:01.892
how many will exist, it is so vital, and the time has come, this is the time,

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:07.892
the time, it’s all mentioned thousands of years back, if you heard about Bhrigumani,

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:11.892
he has written a complete book called as Nadi Granth,

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:14.892
about these times everything described Sahaja yoga everything,

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:23.892
even 100 years back I would say William Blake has described everything about Sahaja yoga everything,

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:29.892
but people called him crazy, they like people like Barron all imaginary people.

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:49.892
Journalist: William Blake was a poet and poetical mystic, are you mystic as well?

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:53.892
Shri Mataji: I don’t know what to call myself it’s very difficult (Laughs)

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:56.892
Journalist: You know what mysticism is? Shri Mataji: I know aha

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:05.892
you can call me everything I think, it’s quite an integration of so many things I have,

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:10.892
but I would like to call myself as the Mother that’s the sweetest and the best I think

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:18.892
because I am very patient, perhaps am extremely forgiving.

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:29.892
Journalist: And how does a Mother bring the light to Her children?

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:47.892
Shri Mataji: It’s a re-birth, re-birth and the birth is given by the Mother only, Father can’t give the birth.

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:53.892
It’s an immaculate re-birth.

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:59.892
Journalist: Once this re-birth has taken place, you’ll have two minds two ways of living

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.892
so no alcohol no drinks, how to move

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:05.892
Shri Mataji: No I don’t tell anything like that before that, but you just give up yourself

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:12.892
I don’t say anything, you just give up yourself, whatever is not good for you, you just give up

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:18.892
because you become joy, start feeling the cool breeze of the `Holy Ghost this gives you vibrations

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:22.892
and you don’t want to do anything like that, now for example if you ask me to take to drugs

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:28.892
I will not I mean I am never tempted for alcohol or any I am never tempted to anything

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:33.892
I am just don’t get tempted or anything you just don’t do it yourself because if you are the spirit

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:38.892
you are so detached. If you become the spirit you become the glory of the spirit,

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:43.892
you have the powers of the spirit, you become such a great personality yourself.

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:52.892
You just don’t do it, I don’t have to tell you, I don’t force anything whatsoever.

00:45:53.000 --> 00:46:00.892
You become yourselves that’s only when you become yourself you are great no doubt about it.

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:07.892
It’s a very revolutionary time, {year}very revolutionary you should see

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:13.892
the signs of revolution we never had so many seekers we never had so many confusions

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:26.892
so many problems and in that confusion only, the lotus of your spirit is going to shine.

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:35.892
We say in Sanskrit that only in the mud and mire of confusion the lotus is born.

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:55.892
It cannot be a money making proposition I mean that you must have understood now,

00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:01.892
cannot be and it has to be effortless, and you get empowered by it you see

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:06.892
if you say I am twice-born alright you certify, but what is your power?

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:12.892
If you are twice-born what do you know? You actually become, become, again I say become is very important

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:18.892
that on your central nervous system you can feel another person,

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:22.892
on your fingertips you can feel the centres of another person and your own,

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:26.892
now only thing what you have to know and get it corrected, that’s all

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:32.892
if you know the method it is finished, hardly you take a month at the most to know about.

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:37.892
Journalist: Can you explain to people, for instance, tonight in Brussels?

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:42.892
Shri Mataji: Yes I, I decode things now for example now supposing this centre is catching

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:47.892
this centre is catching supposing you are feeling the burning on these centres then what does it mean,

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:53.892
I am just decoding it, and then they verify it and is a fact it works out.

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:57.892
We are the real computer I tell you only we are to be put to the mains.

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:02.892
We are the masters of all the computers, we have created computers,

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:09.892
but we become the divine computers and there is divine all-pervading power

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:16.892
which does all living work like these flowers, flowers becoming fruits, we cannot do even one,

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:21.892
and when that starts flowing through us must only know how to manoeuvre it.

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:31.892
We are to be put to the mains, that’s the point is, and this kundalini acts like a chord.

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:36.892
It is there in all of us.

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:44.892
First, it was just people told about it, talked about it, and one or two flowers on the tree of life I should say.

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:50.892
It was a secret also, but now blossom time, so many flowers have to become fruits,

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:56.892
real blossom time, I tell you, beautiful people, we have in this world.

00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:07.892
They are unknown but they are beautiful people. Sinister people are very few actually,

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:11.892
those who have made our lives miserable,

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:17.892
but we can outwit them once we get aware of ourselves we can outwit all of them.

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:26.892
Nobody can touch us, and there is divine power and such blessings you can’t believe it

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:30.892
the miracles of Sahaja Yoga you cannot believe it.

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:38.892
Today only when I came in the morning one of the Sahaja Yogi’s was standing very close to the car

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:45.892
and the whole of Mercedes went over his foot and nothing happened to his foot, nothing,

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:57.892
he didn’t even get the pain, we saw it, it is, God is very great He’s the He’s the real charismatic personality you can’t think of.

00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:03.892
You can’t imagine how great he is we just have to know Him,

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:08.892
but when you talk of God in these modern times people don’t want to hear from you.

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:13.892
It’s not fanaticism it’s not all that non-sense its actualization.

00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:27.892
Journalist: Did you meet the Pope anytime? Shri Mataji: Beg your pardon

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:31.892
Journalist: Did you meet the Pope anytime? Or did you think of meeting him?

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:41.892
Shri Mataji: Oh, (laugh) They are just the same, actually I met Pope much earlier,

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:46.892
that you need not write I am just telling you, when I went to Poland,

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:55.892
I went on 1st of September to Poland about just before he became the Pope,

00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:04.892
I don’t remember the year and because my husband is a VIP and all that is they asked me

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:09.892
where would you like to go so I said I would like to see a good church and an organ

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:13.892
so they took me to Cracow while my husband went for his own work,

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:20.892
and there it was this gentle man was a cardinal, I raised his Kundalini alright

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:27.892
but I didn’t tell him because I mean he won’t take it from me anything, it does,

00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:33.892
it did pierce no doubt it did pierce, it comes up sometimes but then again it goes down,

00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:41.892
I am sorry but that’s what it is, so to become a Pope is very easy, very easy,

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:47.892
I mean to become a Pope what is so great I mean you can be elected human made its a manmade stuff,

00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:57.892
for God made, you have to little bit work it out, that’s what has happened in his case I wish,

00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:04.892
sometimes he does gives vibrations, again it stops again he has to work it out.

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:10.892
I went to Cracow but it was so it was so, it was so historical I should say

00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:14.892
because it was the first of September and I was very sad, and my husband said why are you so sad

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:18.892
I said this country must be very sad on this day sometime,

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:23.892
and then we discovered it was the day first day when it was bombed, Warsaw was bombed

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:32.892
and eighth of September is the day they celebrate the Black Mary’s a birthday,

00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:39.892
and they take out the image of Black Mary, before that I met and then I saw that all that,

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:46.892
it’s very historical I should say, but who can talk to him, I mean they wrote a letter to him

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:51.892
whether he’s protected and you see you can’t talk to him like that cannot.

00:52:52.000 --> 00:53:02.892
All that kind of a thing I don’t need. I mean Christ never had that kind of a protocol this that,

00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:11.892
I mean something different world they live in, I mean you just what can I do, will they listen to me?

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:18.892
Will they recognize Christ? If Christ comes here will he recognize Christ? How will he recognize?

00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:27.892
Pope even, how will he recognize? Can he? Is there any measure?

00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:32.892
I don’t want to criticize anyone that’s one thing I would like to say no controversies, please.

00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:36.892
This is what it is when you ask me the question, I have to say this,

00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:43.892
everybody is capable of becoming the self but must know that by becoming something like a king

00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:50.892
or a Pope or a Guru, you are not there you have to become.

00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:04.892
These are all the appointments by human beings not by God.

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:10.892
All these are appointments by God, here you have Pope, in India we have Shankracharayas

00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:16.892
aaa in Zen system also we have, I met the head of Zen I was amazed,

00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:23.892
his kundalini was frozen there, I didn’t know what to say to him, so I said Sir are you are you, not a Kashyap?

00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:29.892
He said no, we never had them for the last aaa six centuries. I said you never had it,

00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:33.892
they call it a Kashyap never had a Kashyap for six centuries so what are you doing Zen.

00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:42.892
Zen you cannot do without realization, everybody is doing all these things without realization,

00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:45.892
imagine we are telephoning without connection,

00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:52.892
it’s like that very difficult you know because you are so conditioned by them.

00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:58.892
In India also the same thing, we are so conditioned by the so-called Hindu religion.

00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:03.892
Everybody is conditioned and everybody’s religion is in danger,

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:14.892
I don’t understand how can religion be in danger, it cannot be destroyed,

00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:19.892
only thing is according to the time when they came, on the different times

00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:23.892
they were like flowers on the same tree, living tree same,

00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:27.892
but they are different times and according to the times they preached.

00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:31.892
Whatever was the problem at that time they had to face it, you see,

00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:40.892
today is the problem of evolution. Whatever they said people took out this flowers, this is mine,

00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:47.892
this is mine, these are all dead flowers we are fighting with it, you can’t blame anyone,

00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:53.892
maybe some are very gross we can say like Shiites we can call them gross,

00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:58.892
I was born in a Protestant religion and I thought they are the most sophisticated (laughs) fanatics

00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:06.892
they were known very sophisticated, extremely sophisticated are the Protestants,

00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:14.892
you cannot catch them. They will have a red cross everything all humanitarian,

00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:21.892
that’s not God’s job, that’s not God’s job, Missionaries job is not God’s, its human job,

00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:24.892
you have created problems you have poverty alright you look after it,

00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:32.892
God’s job you see is silent it doesn’t talk. Like say, I am sitting before you alright,

00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:38.892
I don’t do anything am I doing anything? I am just talking to you don’t know what I am doing to you,

00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:44.892
it just flows just acts it works. We have seen in the life of Christ somebody touched

00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:51.892
the cloth of Christ and the energy flow, he didn’t have any Missionaries did he?

00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:56.892
And imagine the missionaries came to India with the gun in the one hand

00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:00.892
and the Bible in the another and do you know who Christ was,

00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:07.892
it’s all described in the books our books as Mahavishnu it is described very well clearly who He is.

00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:12.892
But Indians could not relate Him to that because with the gun they never said, they said

00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:18.892
he is with very saumya is the one who is very mild and these people came with the gun

00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:25.892
and Bible they could not place Him there, I don’t blame that way Indians because you see

00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:33.892
you can’t expect Christ to come with the gun, not only gun

00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:37.892
but some Portuguese took cannons to blast the temples,

00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:47.892
they have blasted our temples with cannons can you believe it? Must be crazy people.

00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:51.892
Thank God one thing good has happened, Columbus did not go to India,

00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:56.892
if he had gone all of us would have been finished by now like the Red Indians were

00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:03.892
I tell you thank God. He didn’t come here.

00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:12.892
Like it if you go to Argentina you won’t find one Red Indian. I went to Chile not one Red Indian,

00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:18.892
can you imagine what these people are doing?

00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:26.892
People are not aware of what they are doing what they have done,

00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:31.892
and if you see the massacring Spain I am coming from Spain and when I knew about it the way

00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:40.892
people this inquisition they had for religion, how can you have inquisition Christ was crucified himself,

00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:48.892
what are the basis how can you do such things?

00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:54.892
If you read the history, you’ll be shocked I mean I was shocked the way they showed the inquisition there.

00:58:55.000 --> 00:59:03.892
Actually, I was not aware of it, we have to see what we have done in the name of God,

00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:10.892
in the name of compassion, in the name of love, what we have done.

00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:17.892
They are trying to save now animals, for example, chickens they are trying to save the chickens,

00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:22.892
what’s the use of saving chickens, they have to save the human being, I can’t give realization to chickens, can I?

00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:33.892
You see a political reform or anything you try to do is not going to help you,

00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:39.892
if you think democracy has worked very well I must say it’s not, I have seen Russia,

00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:50.892
I have seen China, I have seen also democracy, everything is about the same, nothing to choose.

00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:56.892
I assure you by changing the forms of government nothing is going to happen

00:59:57.000 --> 01:00:07.892
but the changing the forms of human being only will achieve that kingdom of God which is promised to us.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:13.892
We have to get out of it, our forefathers have done it, their forefathers have done it

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:21.892
where have we reached, nowhere, there is no peace in the world unless and until

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:29.892
we have peace within ourselves, especially, for Brussels when I came I must say about Brussels

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:33.892
I must say people are very hectic here, extremely hectic

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:38.892
because I could feel it within myself you see there’s a centre

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:45.892
which goes wobbly when the place is hectic extremely hectic speedy frustrated people,

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:49.892
and this centre was doing like this and for three hours I was trying to cleanse it

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:54.892
I mean I have I was trying to put it right just going on like this I was worried that when I face you

01:00:55.000 --> 01:01:01.892
people I hope it doesn’t go into (laughs) another wobbly condition very wobbly people are very wobbly

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:09.892
we must understand. Extremely hectic, now in a person who has got blood cancer

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:14.892
you have this problem the centre goes off like that, the blood cancer people,

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:22.892
because the spleen which is the speedometer you see becomes crazy, and it starts wobbling,

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:26.892
starts producing blood cells of that kind, of course its triggered by something else

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:36.892
but the vulnerability of cancer is like that and that’s what I felt when I came I was surprised how people are like that here,

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:46.892
no peace. And we have the Europeans what is it here parliament (What is it here?) Common Market in Brussels,

01:01:47.000 --> 01:02:00.892
imagine in Brussels. We have no peace within, when I come to Brussels, I am Belgian,

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:10.892
because I can feel that, I really felt you all, it is very simple to cur correct it very simple

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:18.892
only this kundalini within you is to rise and everything will be so peaceful.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:27.892
We are so nervous, and if it is our own why not have it?

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:33.892
Supposing this is your property why not have it? It’s your right to have it.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:42.892
It’s your own property you don’t have to give anything. Like somebody asked me, Mother,

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:47.892
I cannot surrender, I said what have you got to surrender me when, what can you give me

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:53.892
I don’t need anything, what you have to surrender is your ego or your conditioning one of the two.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:57.892
What do you surrender there is nothing but ego.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:04.892
Only one simple thing we have to know and understand that still we are not complete

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:10.892
we have not reached our absolute state, we are living on a relative level,

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:15.892
we have to become the absolute, finished once you realize that much finished,

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:19.892
just we have to become the absolute, we have been living relatively,

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:26.892
it’s our own power we have got within ourselves why not have it, for which you cannot pay,

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:32.892
even but it is a very big problem it’s a very very big problem I must say it’s like a balloon.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:37.892
It floats people into the air of course conditioning is also there, in the west,

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:43.892
there is big conditioning especially of feeling guilty, for nothing at all they feel guilty.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:49.892
In the west people feel so guilty for I just don’t know why and the catch in this centre

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:55.892
gives trouble in the centre, this is the biggest conditioning you have is to feel guilty

01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:00.892
for anything like you see now in England, supposing you use a fork and a spoon

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:06.892
in a different way they feel guilty, I mean you yourself have created these norms

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:10.892
like for alcohol you’ll have this kind of a glass that kind of a glass this that all nonsense

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:17.892
now if you don’t have that way you’ll feel guilty what is this?

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:23.892
I mean you are very simple people also to feel guilty for all the nonsensical things.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:30.892
If a lady is wearing say a sweater or a coat say with beige colour,

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:41.892
she’s carrying a white coloured purse, she feels guilty, very seriously guilty, I tell you,

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:50.892
this is so frivolous, they are like children sometimes I feel Indians will not they are shameless

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:58.892
(laughs) I must say they don’t feel guilty at all, I mean you should not feel guilty for this ,

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:04.892
Haa one can feel guilty for wars or things, but even by feeling guilty what is there

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:09.892
and now like English feel guilty for what English did before, why they are dead and finished,

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:15.892
now gone case you are different you are not them your forefathers are finished now forget the past.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:24.892
Now say simple thing forget the past future doesn’t exist in the present how can you be guilty,

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:34.892
simple logic (laughs), how can you be guilty in the present forget its finished.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:41.892
Like that forget and finished is your past, so how can you be guilty?

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:46.892
You have to be in the present, actually, we must respect ourselves.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:51.892
You are at the epitome of evolution we don’t respect our self, we have to love our self

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:55.892
and respect we are human beings we are on top of everything

01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:00.892
we are not ego at all, but we are not also conditioning.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:16.892
No question because you have gone beyond though I know that

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:20.892
you won’t have you are feeling the cool breeze, you can feel it, just feel it just now, try to feel,

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:25.892
Madam, you also have the experience just one minute you just have the experience,

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:30.892
just put your hands like this you’ll feel it the cool breeze,

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:39.892
just to open your hands have I not, have it, why not have it? It is free, alright?

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:44.892
Left is there Do you smoke? No,

01:06:50.000 --> 01:07:00.892
Heart, Heart, how are you feeling? Yes, feeling, the feeling, what about you?

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:02.892
Are you Catholic? Yes

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:09.892
Then you feel guilty (everyone laughs) that’s one thing Catholics have done

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:15.892
I tell you Catholics are the greatest guilty people, for nothing at all, if you go to Argentina

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:23.892
you’ll be shocked they walk like this, all the time they are told they are sinners, sinners, sinners,

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:35.892
they are not, that’s the reason, she’s left Vishuddhi catching but you know it’s very dangerous,

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:44.892
you get troubles with this Spondolytis physical you also get angina to feel guilty

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:52.892
only there is one chanting for that “I am not guilty” Then it works out,

01:07:53.000 --> 01:08:01.892
that’s the reason it’s not rising above this but it will rise, are you alright? Are you feeling?

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:05.892
You are feeling relaxed though. Yes actually, there is no worry now.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:14.892
No there were lots of wrinkles here when I came now you go and see they are all vanished,

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:19.892
yes. Are you alright? Little bit. Good. A little bit, yes that’s true its very subtle

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:26.892
and we are rising from a gross attention to this subtle attention alright?

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:32.892
And we should be selfish about it why we are attached to anything?

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:37.892
Attached to any ideology, any theory, anything we should get it you see

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:47.892
this is what Christ has said you have to get it. Those who are sitting behind you have got it.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:57.892
They also argued a lot with me but you did not I must say not at all they did not, never argue.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:03.892
But religion cannot be organised one thing you must know it cannot be organised.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:08.892
Once you start organizing religion you kill the essence of religion. You cannot.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:21.892
That’s the mistake, thank God in India religion could not be organised thank God for that,

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:27.892
where ever they have organised religion they became fanatics, so much,

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:33.892
so much rooted into the conditioning of the religion, anywhere I mean I must say everybody is like that ,

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:39.892
they think no end of themselves or they get ideas sometimes that we are the best,

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:44.892
we know the best we got everything, that’s not true,

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:49.892
anywhere like Sikhs now I used to think Sikhs at least are better off, now look at them,

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:53.892
gone off their heads, putting bombs everywhere, why should anybody who follows any religion

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:59.892
should put bombs anywhere, just I mean is it relevant?

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:07.892
They were also organised in India, very well organised, we have another one called Arya Samaaj,

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:13.892
they are very ego-oriented nonsense, now the people coming out of it because when they get old

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.892
they really become senile and they talk so much

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:22.892
they just go on talking they don’t know what they are talking irrelevantly they just talk.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:35.892
You cannot be anything, you have to be human being first, when we claim I am a Belgian,

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:43.892
you are not, you could have been anything, just by chance you are born here or maybe you chose,

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:45.892
doesn’t matter but still you don’t become Belgian, you are a human being,

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:57.892
you laugh the same way, you smile the same way, feel the same way, only you think differently, maybe.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:02.892
So it is the difference and all that doesn’t exist in the mind of God

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:10.892
He doesn’t create this world like Belgium, France this that, no he did not, we have done all this.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:24.892
This is difficult because conditioning also is too much, conditioning of materialism is also here,

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:33.892
and no tradition of seeking, this is the biggest problem I feel no trade every Indian knows

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:39.892
that he has to seek his spirit and he knows what kundalini is I mean if he is not westernised,

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:43.892
that’s one of the conditions, if he is westernised he is just like you,

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.892
doesn’t know anything about it doesn’t want to know,

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:54.892
anyone who is not westernised knows that it’s the kundalini awakening that brings forth the realisation in India.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:58.892
I went to the Himalayas, Dharamshala,

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:02.892
people are uneducated absolutely came down over three to four thousand people, just came

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:06.892
and they were told Devi Jagran, the Goddess will be awakened within,

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:14.892
they know who is the Goddess is, they just came, I gave them a lecture, any problem?

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.892
No Mother awakened our Goddess I said alright done. And such tremendous vibrations,

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:23.892
they are not educated, they haven’t got all this conditioning on them simple village folk,

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:25.892
all of them got realisation, they knew they have got it.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:31.892
They started singing dancing enjoying themselves oh we have got it now we ‘ve got they know

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:39.892
despite their aaa I should their no exposure to western thinking or to education as such,

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.892
they know this they know for tradition from mother,

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:47.892
mother knows from her mother like that it comes to them from generations

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:51.892
that you have to be the spirit.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:58.892
Even Christian should know and I think they knew the whole thing got diverted,

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:02.892
now there is a big controversy you must know, Christianity itself is a challenge,

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:10.892
thanks to theologians, you must have a word about Mr, what ‘s his name Bishop of Durham

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:16.892
did you hear about him? No? Oh! you must that’s the latest,

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:20.892
Bishop of Durham says there was no immaculate conception according to Paul,

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:33.892
there was no, no this thing, this is what it is, closed mind and then criticize me.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:40.892
what’s the use of adherence to something that is ignorance now this Bishop of Durum

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:46.892
has to I mean attacked Christ immaculate conception His divinity everything he has attacked

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:54.892
and for your information, the Archbishop of Canterbury has supported him,

01:13:55.000 --> 01:14:03.892
so now the whole Catholicism goes to dogs. but they cannot give up Paul also but,

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:07.892
to be frank why Paul is then I don’t understand, can you explain?

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:13.892
Why Paul is in the Bible, he has nothing to do with Christ.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:19.892
Not only I say that but if you have read Khalil Gibran he was a realised soul,

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:30.892
this Paul is a strange man, he’s written a complete chapter on Paul, how is he there?

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:35.892
Anybody who is a realised soul will say that he has nothing to do with God.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.892
He doesn’t understand God at all.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:47.892
Then came Augustine, same, same style, maybe the same incarnation, he also ruined it.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:51.892
Now if you want to know about Catholics go and ask the Muslims,

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.892
if you want to know about the Muslims go and ask Hindus,

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:58.892
This is better to know from them, they are all sailing in the same boat,

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:10.892
but criticizing either blaming each other. No use. How will they recognize Christ?

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:26.892
Is the first question one should ask. When He comes there will be no Sahaja yoga then the last,

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:32.892
he just sorts you out, the judgement is now, he just sorts you out.

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:40.892
There will be no question and Michel Angelo has clearly shown it if you should see the Sistine Chapel very clearly.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:45.892
He is just standing there throwing people this side and that side that’s the Agnya Chakra where He stands,

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:57.892
just throwing out He doesn’t do anything of that kind He has no patience, that’s what it is, and that’s coming very soon.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:03.892
Journalist: You explain why the time has now arrived?

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:09.892
Shri Mataji: You see you are the time has to arrive according to your awareness you see.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:17.892
And the awareness today is that of that level, so it has come.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:28.892
That’s like supposing you are learning to aaa balance a cycle, now when do you balance the cycle when you balance it. (laughs).

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:35.892
It is just like that when you balance the cycle then you get it isn’t it so now you are in that situation,

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:42.892
so it is going to work out. It’s the season I would say,

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:49.892
now supposing you want to have in those days Tulips, you can’t have isn’t it,

01:16:50.000 --> 01:17:00.892
now the time the seasons, and imagine with Christ do you think so many people would sit down and listen to Him.

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:09.892
No, very difficult, now we have sensible people, wiser people, nobody is going to crucify me now,

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:18.892
you think anybody can crucify me, no cannot, I mean maybe journalist may, later on (laugh).

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:25.892
Alright thank you very much, very kind of you, you have given me very patient hearing

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:29.892
I am sorry for the Catholic lady she didn’t like me much you see,

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:35.892
but you should not be biased if you are a journalist you have to be a witness, a detached witness,

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:40.892
then only you can help people, but if you are biased then you cannot work out,

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:46.892
so I have seen journalists are either biased or they want some sort of a sensation to believe,

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:52.892
now this is I am taking away from that sensationalization

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:57.892
I am giving you a news by which everything will be smoothed out,

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:03.892
it will be better and there will be a journalist but of a divine nature.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:10.892
We have journalism also in Sahaja yoga but then we talk of the miracles we talk of the savings,

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:15.892
we talk of the good things that have happened we have, we have our newsletters and all that,

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:30.892
but it’s a very different type, another world. We have some journalists with us also.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:36.892
Done now? Journalist: I thought there was no question

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:47.892
Shri Mataji: I think he has gone beyond questioning. (laughs) Alright.

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:51.892
So thank you very much. Sahaj Yogi: Why don’t you come along tonight here. Shri Mataji: Yes Try,

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.892
Sahaja Yogi: See how it works

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:58.892
Shri Mataji: If you can come along that’s the best way, you see , best way,

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:04.892
there’s no challenge for it nothing no challenge, but it’s something very really to be very frank,

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:09.892
very new for you, not for Indians but for you its new, you must come and have a look,

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:16.892
maybe I might be making money also possibly, …laughs.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:24.892
Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you all. May God Bless you.

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:50.892
This is the book. Have got some copies of that?

01:19:51.000 --> 01:20:04.892
We’ll send it, tonight at the program you can have it. Should we go now, Thank you very much.
