00:01.469 --> 00:06.542
It is my immense joy

00:06.743 --> 00:15.920
to see all of you here from various parts of this world.

00:20.287 --> 00:23.097
When your heart is so full,

00:23.298 --> 00:29.454
the words are too poor to carry the intensity.

00:30.413 --> 00:41.511
I wish you could understand that intensity, through your heart.

00:43.633 --> 00:48.200
It’s all been arranged, I think, by the Divine,

00:48.400 --> 00:51.626
that we should meet here all of us

00:51.827 --> 00:57.228
in such a wonderful surrounding, in the Nature.

00:57.429 --> 01:01.179
That something great should happen to all of us.

01:01.380 --> 01:10.059
That we should achieve really something great this time.

01:11.940 --> 01:19.743
Now as the time is short, I will tell you, first of all,

01:19.944 --> 01:25.969
a few things about meditation now,

01:26.169 --> 01:31.949
then we’ll have two more talks, I hope so.

01:40.020 --> 01:47.358
‘Meditation’ is a very general word. It is not a word that explains

01:47.559 --> 01:53.519
all the three steps one has to take for meditating.

01:53.727 --> 02:01.858
But in Sanskrit language, they have very clearly said

02:02.058 --> 02:07.971
how you have to move in your meditation.

02:09.305 --> 02:14.639
First is called as dhyana,

02:14.840 --> 02:18.702
and second is called as dharana,

02:18.903 --> 02:23.359
and the third is called as samadhi.

02:23.560 --> 02:30.009
Luckily Sahaja Yoga is a, such a thing that you get everything in a bundle.

02:30.210 --> 02:34.159
You avoided everything else and you got the samadhi part.

02:34.360 --> 02:41.085
That’s the beauty of it. Firstly the dhyana.

02:43.717 --> 02:49.921
First, when you have seeking,

02:50.121 --> 03:02.460
you put your attention towards the object of your worship.

03:02.902 --> 03:07.372
That’s called as ‘dhyana’.

03:07.573 --> 03:14.816
And the dharana is the one in which you

03:15.017 --> 03:20.879
put all your effort, concentrate all your effort.

03:21.080 --> 03:26.381
But this is all drama for people who are not Realised.

03:26.903 --> 03:34.630
For them it’s just a sort of an acting that they do,

03:34.831 --> 03:42.879
but for a Realised-soul it is a reality.

03:43.460 --> 03:50.677
So the first, the dhyana, you have to do.

03:55.460 --> 04:00.980
Some do it of the Form, another of the Formless.

04:01.180 --> 04:08.988
But you are so fortunate that the Formless has become a Form for you.

04:10.500 --> 04:13.406
No problem. You don’t have to go from form to formless

04:13.607 --> 04:20.273
and from formless to form, it’s all there, in a bundle!

04:21.570 --> 04:36.649
So you concentrate or think of some deity

04:36.850 --> 04:44.489
or some point for nirakar, for the Formless or of nirakar itself.

04:44.690 --> 04:48.739
It’s also mental projection as long as you are not a Realised-soul.

04:48.940 --> 04:58.182
But once you are Realised,
you have to just think of dhyana:

04:58.382 --> 05:06.170
[on] whom you are going

05:06.370 --> 05:10.810
to concentrate or you can say, meditate on.

05:11.010 --> 05:16.729
But once you start meditating on a person, your attention starts moving.

05:16.930 --> 05:20.619
That is also possible after Realisation.

05:20.820 --> 05:23.787
Though it’s in a bundle, but some people have it, part of it,

05:23.987 --> 05:30.460
part of it, like that. So when you meditate,

05:30.660 --> 05:38.940
still your attention can get disturbed every moment.

05:39.140 --> 05:44.540
It can happen, depending on the intensity of your concentration.

05:44.740 --> 05:47.499
So there are some Sahaja Yogis, I have seen,

05:47.700 --> 05:54.539
they are cooking, and there’s another one who is meditating.

05:54.740 --> 06:01.528
The meditating one will say, "Oh I can smell it is burning."

06:06.447 --> 06:10.459
So there is no dharana.

06:10.660 --> 06:13.419
‘Dhaar’ means a flow, a continuous flow.

06:13.620 --> 06:18.299
So there is no dharana. Dhyana is there, but not dharana.

06:18.500 --> 06:22.151
The second part of it is very important,

06:22.351 --> 06:33.019
that you have to put your attention continuously onto your deity.

06:33.220 --> 06:36.213
Then you develop a state, which is called as ‘dharana’,

06:36.413 --> 06:47.419
in which your attention becomes one with the deity.

06:47.620 --> 06:52.539
But when these mature, the third stage of samadhi comes in.

06:52.740 --> 06:58.957
Now for people who think that, without Realisation, they can do it,

06:59.158 --> 07:04.859
I think they are absolutely mistaken.

07:05.060 --> 07:15.576
But after Realisation also, when the dharana is established,

07:15.776 --> 07:23.660
you have to get to the position where you become samadhi.

07:23.860 --> 07:28.258
Now, what is that state?

07:28.458 --> 07:37.046
When that state comes into your mind, then whatever you do,

07:37.246 --> 07:43.362
the deity that you worship,

07:43.562 --> 07:48.991
you see that deity in your work.

07:49.192 --> 07:56.318
Whatever you see, you see the deity giving you the show.

07:56.519 --> 07:58.700
You can put it like that.

07:58.901 --> 08:09.180
Whatever you hear, you find the deity telling you the Truth.

08:09.380 --> 08:17.020
Whatever you read, you find there what the deity would tell you.

08:17.220 --> 08:22.945
So in that state, whatever you do

08:23.145 --> 08:30.540
with your eyes, nose and all these organs,

08:30.741 --> 08:37.802
all that becomes a kind of a manifestation

08:38.002 --> 08:43.623
of the deity whom you worship, automatically.

08:43.824 --> 08:47.099
You don’t have to think, "Now I must concentrate, alright.

08:47.300 --> 08:52.539
I will not have these thoughts, I have to now think about this."

08:52.740 --> 08:54.932
It becomes automatically that.

08:55.133 --> 08:58.347
You read a book, in that book immediately you find

08:58.547 --> 09:01.340
what is good for Sahaja Yoga.

09:01.540 --> 09:07.153
If there’s a book, which is anti-God, you discard it.

09:07.353 --> 09:09.579
Just call Marina there.

09:09.780 --> 09:22.101
But if you have a problem,

09:22.301 --> 09:32.380
you see that, "It must be for some lesson to me.

09:32.580 --> 09:37.740
That it is to teach me some experience."

09:37.940 --> 09:42.220
It is the manifestation of the deity itself.

09:42.420 --> 09:45.819
For example a lady feels she is going to have an abortion,

09:46.019 --> 09:49.593
take a position.

09:49.793 --> 09:54.940
So one person who is not yet in samadhi avasta,

09:55.140 --> 09:58.965
or condition, will say, "Oh God, I am such a Sahaja Yogi,

09:59.165 --> 10:04.505
I have done so much for Mother. I went all the way to Pulborough thing,

10:04.705 --> 10:09.603
and, despite that, see, this is the problem!"

10:10.980 --> 10:15.820
But another would say that, "Alright let me try. I’ll go and tell Mother."

10:16.020 --> 10:19.739
On the photograph, or maybe telephone, something.

10:19.940 --> 10:24.940
And he’ll find, to his surprise, that it’s all done.

10:25.140 --> 10:28.780
It’s perfectly alright.

10:28.980 --> 10:32.780
This is only possible if you are a Realised-soul, otherwise not possible.

10:32.980 --> 10:37.475
So the state that is awakened within you is called,

10:37.675 --> 10:41.278
is a new state of mind, in Sanskrit language

10:41.478 --> 10:44.676
it has a very beautiful name is ‘Rutumbhara Pradnya’.

10:44.877 --> 10:49.029
Which is a very difficult name. Rutumbhara Pradnya.

10:49.230 --> 10:53.820
Rutumbhara means the whole, Rutumbhara is the name of the Nature.

10:54.020 --> 11:02.975
And that the whole Nature, one feels, is enlightened.

11:04.340 --> 11:08.877
I’ll give an example: when a child is to be born,

11:09.077 --> 11:15.730
the mother starts lactating, automatically.

11:16.500 --> 11:22.620
The Nature itself works out for the birth of the child.

11:22.820 --> 11:27.041
In the same way, when this Rutumbhara Pradnya,

11:27.241 --> 11:33.803
starts expressing itself - only for Sahaja Yogis, nobody else -

11:34.003 --> 11:36.500
you are amazed how things work out suddenly.

11:36.701 --> 11:39.362
Rutumbhara Pradnya it works out.

11:39.563 --> 11:45.260
Now the time is very short, but I’ll give you an example.

11:45.460 --> 11:50.434
I came to Brighton,

11:50.634 --> 11:53.260
and Jason said, "Mother let’s have Guru Puja in Brighton".

11:53.460 --> 11:58.940
I said, "Alright, have it, but you find out the place."

11:59.140 --> 12:02.140
So he went to the university, said, "The university people will help,

12:02.340 --> 12:05.660
but it’s rather small and…" I said, "But ask them".

12:05.860 --> 12:07.985
"But no, it’s booked on Guru Puja." Then I said,

12:08.186 --> 12:10.780
"Then what can you do?" He said, "Then what to do Mother?"

12:10.980 --> 12:15.179
I said, "You try somewhere else just now, telephone to somebody else."

12:15.380 --> 12:17.873
So he went through yellow pages, I don’t know what, and he telephoned,

12:18.074 --> 12:21.687
and they said, "We have a place, a beautiful place,

12:21.887 --> 12:27.751
and you come along and have lunch with us."

12:27.952 --> 12:30.619
And just he went there, he had a very nice lunch,

12:30.819 --> 12:33.739
they were very happy [that] they were to accommodate everyone.

12:33.940 --> 12:36.468
They were very nice, and he was amazed

12:36.668 --> 12:40.229
how everything has worked out so well.

12:40.429 --> 12:47.600
So the Rutumbhara Pradnya has started working in your favour.

12:47.800 --> 12:50.537
You all tell me, "This is a miracle, that has happened Mother,

12:50.738 --> 12:54.244
and we don’t know how it has happened!" I’ll give you an example:

12:54.444 --> 12:57.266
Yesterday, you we were doing something with cement

12:57.466 --> 13:01.519
and the Italian boy said that we’ll need two bags of cement.

13:01.720 --> 13:05.720
I said, "You carry on, it won’t finish!" Even before I was leaving,

13:05.921 --> 13:09.122
they were carrying on, still not finished!

13:09.322 --> 13:14.592
Now cement of all the things. Imagine!

13:16.237 --> 13:20.433
So this special thing is your own state,

13:20.633 --> 13:24.704
where you are feeling the oneness with the Nature

13:24.904 --> 13:27.771
and the Nature is feeling oneness with you.

13:27.979 --> 13:31.420
So the Divine itself is expressing through Nature,

13:31.620 --> 13:39.022
through various happenings, through various incidents –

13:39.222 --> 13:47.679
the Love, the protection, the attention that the Divine is giving.

13:47.880 --> 13:50.910
And there’s no end to it.

13:51.111 --> 13:58.960
It just happens, and people don’t know how it happens.

13:59.160 --> 14:02.320
But that is what is the state of samadhi.

14:02.520 --> 14:07.360
But there could be people if I tell them,

14:07.560 --> 14:11.360
"Will you do this?" "Oh no Mother! The shop will be closed."

14:11.560 --> 14:15.053
"Oh, They won’t do it!" "That’s not alright".

14:15.254 --> 14:18.713
They go on like that. And there are people

14:18.913 --> 14:22.480
who say, "No! Let’s see. If Mother has said – maybe."

14:22.680 --> 14:26.238
I’ll give you another simple example, very simple, absolutely gross,

14:26.439 --> 14:31.920
but it’s there: One day Mr. Shrivastava, he takes one type of tea.

14:32.120 --> 14:36.347
Very English.

14:36.547 --> 14:41.049
And he wouldn’t like other tea. So he told me, "Oh God,

14:41.249 --> 14:44.159
we are finished with the tea and what to do tomorrow morning?"

14:44.360 --> 14:46.801
I said, "It’s alright, let us go to the tea shop."

14:47.002 --> 14:52.160
So he said, "It is eight o’clock in the night and what do you mean?

14:52.360 --> 14:56.479
They’ll all laugh at us! There is no shop at eight o’clock open."

14:56.680 --> 14:58.640
That tea centre. I said, "Let’s go! What’s the harm.

14:58.840 --> 15:00.799
I am just saying ‘let’s go!’ " But he said,

15:01.000 --> 15:03.680
"What absurd things you are saying!" I said, "Alright, absurd whatever it is.

15:03.880 --> 15:05.538
Let’s go!"

15:05.738 --> 15:09.131
So he wouldn’t listen so I told the driver "Alright, let’s drive down!"

15:09.331 --> 15:11.840
We went there. And the lights were on.

15:12.040 --> 15:15.839
We said, "Eh! How is it the lights are on?" (laughter)

15:16.040 --> 15:19.435
So we walked in, you see, very peevishly.

15:19.635 --> 15:22.640
And they all were there standing, "Oh we’ve been waiting for you

15:22.840 --> 15:25.825
such a long time, you know, and you are the last to come!"

15:26.026 --> 15:28.639
Just imagine! So I asked my husband.

15:28.840 --> 15:33.867
He said, "I forgot we had a reception here!" (laughter).

15:37.480 --> 15:40.880
And they said, "You are the last to arrive!"

15:41.081 --> 15:43.747
And they said, "Alright, doesn’t matter but you’ll have your presents!"

15:43.947 --> 15:49.621
So they gave us two tins each of tea! (laughter)

15:56.680 --> 16:00.079
I mean, there are thousand and one examples like that.

16:00.280 --> 16:02.719
Today like some were trying to push the bed.

16:02.920 --> 16:05.520
The three of them were trying, it would not push.

16:05.720 --> 16:09.280
I said, "Alright, I’ll push it." I just put my Nabhi there.

16:09.480 --> 16:15.276
Just, I didn’t push anything, it just pushed.

16:17.560 --> 16:20.442
Because of the Rutumbhara Pradnya .

16:20.643 --> 16:23.051
But this is not chamatkar (miracle) or anything.

16:23.252 --> 16:29.087
It exists in the Divine the capacity to manifest it’s love,

16:29.287 --> 16:36.180
to show that you are the saints, you are the chosen ones of God.

16:36.381 --> 16:39.232
But you accept that situation first. But if you behave

16:39.433 --> 16:42.620
like all other normal people, "Oh God, the shops are closed,

16:42.821 --> 16:46.586
and that man is so difficult, and I don’t think it will happen",

16:46.786 --> 16:49.599
never happen.

16:49.800 --> 16:53.055
But you must know you are saints,

16:53.255 --> 17:02.529
chosen, and given birth by me, the Form and the Formless.

17:02.730 --> 17:07.360
So this Pradnya is going to manifest, is manifesting every moment,

17:07.560 --> 17:11.130
be prepared, be happy, welcome it,

17:11.331 --> 17:17.867
and accept that you are that.
The level is different.

17:18.067 --> 17:21.820
Was done? Alright?

17:22.873 --> 17:26.433
Five minutes more.

17:28.019 --> 17:33.159
I should blame anything that side.

17:33.820 --> 17:37.239
Alright.

17:37.947 --> 17:46.040
Now the time has come for Sahaja Yoga to change it’s level.

17:50.200 --> 17:56.341
We have to change, we have to go higher, the level has to come up.

17:56.542 --> 18:00.516
But Sahaja Yoga is such a cosmopolitan thing

18:00.716 --> 18:08.118
that we have got the worst bhoots
to the highest, on the same plate.

18:08.824 --> 18:12.559
Now, some of them are round ones,

18:12.759 --> 18:19.599
which are the ego-oriented ones, who roll all the time.

18:19.800 --> 18:25.360
They don’t know how to raise the plate.
If you raise the plate they’ll roll down.

18:25.560 --> 18:28.637
So you are frightened you have to hold them.

18:28.837 --> 18:35.280
And there are some who are squares.

18:36.086 --> 18:41.475
And the square ones are carrying other squares on their heads, like bhoots.

18:41.675 --> 18:45.368
So if you raise them they may all topple down,

18:45.568 --> 18:49.840
or maybe the bhoots might fall off. God knows.

18:50.040 --> 18:55.520
But there are third type who are prisms, who are like pyramids,

18:55.720 --> 18:58.971
who are nicely settled down, whatever level you raise them,

18:59.171 --> 19:04.359
they are stuck there.

19:06.428 --> 19:14.560
So those who are at the periphery are a problem, definitely, for me,

19:14.760 --> 19:21.043
because in my compassion, I cannot throw them out.

19:22.049 --> 19:26.505
And we have to help them to come out,

19:26.705 --> 19:32.823
by really now, telling them, that they have to rise.

19:33.024 --> 19:38.950
How long are we to wait for them?

19:39.151 --> 19:43.774
Everyone has to see that the peripheral people

19:43.975 --> 19:51.165
are brought in properly so that they don’t go out of Sahaja Yoga.

19:51.851 --> 19:56.011
Compassion is alright,

19:56.211 --> 20:04.640
but not at the cost of keeping the level of Sahaja Yoga lower, never.

20:04.840 --> 20:12.248
We have to raise the level of people
who are well settled in Sahaja Yoga.

20:12.448 --> 20:16.550
So everybody must try to settle down

20:16.750 --> 20:23.966
and come up to minimum standards at least.

20:24.166 --> 20:29.605
Otherwise, I am sorry, many will be sieved out.

20:29.805 --> 20:32.955
That’s for the five minutes!

20:33.155 --> 20:37.461
I’ll have another, I think, one hour or so,

20:37.661 --> 20:40.880
one and a half hour later on today.

20:41.081 --> 20:45.228
Please. Thank you very much.

20:46.898 --> 20:53.688
I would say that somebody should translate it if possible.

20:56.828 --> 20:59.508
Is it possible to translate?

20:59.709 --> 21:01.714
Yogi: We could translate it afterwards, Mother.

21:01.915 --> 21:07.108
In French then to be told them Rutumbhara Pradnya and all that.

21:07.735 --> 21:10.045
Later on you can translate.

21:10.246 --> 21:18.185
I mean those who have to go for lunch now should be English then.

21:22.199 --> 21:28.995
Then he can explain it, the first part, as you please, I don’t know.

21:29.196 --> 21:33.155
Those who are staying here, should not, those who are come, should.

21:33.356 --> 21:35.888
Is wrong.

21:36.089 --> 21:44.040
The guests must be looked after, I mean, the other way round.

21:46.656 --> 21:48.815
Now we have to divide in two halves,

21:49.015 --> 21:51.242
but I would say those who understand English should go

21:51.443 --> 21:54.029
because then Gregoire can speak about this

21:54.229 --> 21:59.305
and somebody can translate also in Italian.

21:59.506 --> 22:01.727
Gregoire: Shri Mother, I’m sorry,

22:01.927 --> 22:05.379
but it’s already divided with numbers in two lots,

22:05.580 --> 22:08.376
so I think the first number has just to go.

22:08.577 --> 22:11.457
Shri Mataji: Is it already divided?
Gregoire: Yes it’s already…

22:11.658 --> 22:14.241
Shri Mataji: …organised!!!
Gregoire: Organised.

22:14.442 --> 22:16.590
Shri Mataji: Oh, I see.

22:16.791 --> 22:20.818
I didn’t know who is here unhappy.

22:21.019 --> 22:23.732
Both of you have come?
Yogi: Mother?

22:23.933 --> 22:26.366
Shri Mataji: Only two of you have come? Yogi: Three.

22:26.567 --> 22:29.930
Shri Mataji: Who is?
Yogi: Alfredo and Ricardo.

22:30.131 --> 22:32.787
Shri Mataji: Who?
Yogi: Alfredo and Ricardo.

22:32.988 --> 22:36.794
Shri Mataji: Good, good. Busy hai! Good. So how are you?

22:36.995 --> 22:38.509
Yogi: I’m alright now.

22:38.710 --> 22:41.683
Shri Mataji: ….substantially support Sahaja Yoga.

22:41.884 --> 22:54.748
Like Dr. Warren has brought a very good extract, I think.

22:54.949 --> 22:58.365
Is it an extract? Gavin: Yes
you read it Mother, you read it.

22:58.566 --> 23:07.120
Shri Mataji: Just imagine! He was a Catholic Christian church fellow

23:07.320 --> 23:13.432
who could say all these things so clearly and see so clearly.

23:17.789 --> 23:23.096
And this book, you see, Essenes, that a book.

23:23.297 --> 23:38.088
But now Rustom told me that he has found out, in the Koran,

23:38.288 --> 23:47.538
that the Kundalini resides in the triangular bone is called as Asus.

23:47.739 --> 23:50.571
And at the time of Resurrection,

23:50.771 --> 23:56.286
this will be raised and people will get their Realisation.

23:56.486 --> 24:00.549
Can you imagine?

24:01.000 --> 24:05.985
The second thing he said, the same thing which has written in these books

24:06.185 --> 24:12.913
that there are seven firmaments and there are seven powers.

24:13.114 --> 24:16.161
Can you imagine?

24:16.362 --> 24:20.658
All that is described in the Koran and what are these Muslims doing

24:20.859 --> 24:24.420
and what are these Christians doing?

24:24.621 --> 24:27.378
But even those who knew, the Hindus, so-called,

24:27.578 --> 24:30.957
what are they doing? Stupid.

24:31.157 --> 24:34.228
Everybody seems to be stupid.

24:34.428 --> 24:39.440
You can’t blame those who knew and you can’t blame those did not.

24:39.640 --> 24:43.141
They are just the same.

24:43.341 --> 24:49.031
It’s very clearly written all about the seven chakras and everything

24:49.231 --> 24:51.679
since the Patanjali.

24:51.880 --> 24:56.992
But who is seeking God?

25:00.360 --> 25:04.127
But these discoveries are coming up and they are going to substantiate

25:04.328 --> 25:08.799
and you are going to talk to these people

25:08.999 --> 25:16.039
about the kind of things they have been doing to the essence of religion.

25:16.520 --> 25:20.005
But these are authentic things.

25:20.205 --> 25:25.665
People want to believe into something that has happened.

25:26.200 --> 25:34.696
That’s a good thing in a way because we have some certificates.

25:43.108 --> 25:47.040
Nobody wants to ask any questions to me?

25:47.240 --> 25:50.049
Because one third is missing so I would like to speak

25:50.249 --> 25:55.123
about general things later on.

25:56.289 --> 25:59.154
Yes, yes.

25:59.392 --> 26:03.011
Yogi: We were just talking about your comments.

26:03.212 --> 26:05.911
For example in Islam we were talking about the Mahedi

26:06.111 --> 26:10.903
who looks like a Muslim with a beard.

26:13.648 --> 26:16.594
Yes.

26:16.795 --> 26:21.413
In Islam we were talking about the Mahedi who looks like a Muslim with a beard.

26:21.613 --> 26:27.080
And in Buddhism they are talking about a Maitreya who is like a man.

26:27.281 --> 26:31.962
Every religion is talking about a coming who is in their own form,

26:32.162 --> 26:36.620
I mean, projecting. What about this?

26:36.820 --> 26:42.063
But they are all talking about your coming.

26:42.264 --> 26:48.160
Many of these scriptures are mutilated and changed also.

26:48.360 --> 26:54.890
And Buddha is, of course, is a laughing Buddha.

26:55.090 --> 26:58.065
They think of ‘laughing Buddha’.

26:58.265 --> 27:04.320
Then because it was Mohammed Sahib they think of a fakir.

27:04.520 --> 27:12.854
Because your mind is like a projector,

27:13.055 --> 27:19.612
and the film is what you have seen before, like Mohammed Sahib.

27:19.813 --> 27:27.625
So the mind projects it and you get Mohammed Sahib as the image.

27:28.920 --> 27:33.680
So whatever film you are using, it depends on [that].

27:33.880 --> 27:40.187
But whatever has happened never happens again.

27:41.321 --> 27:44.430
So if you have seen with the film, say, for example,

27:44.631 --> 27:48.720
if you have made a film, it’s made once for all.

27:48.920 --> 27:53.404
You do not make the same film, do you?

27:53.640 --> 27:57.458
I mean you are having "Mouse Trap" (play in London theatre) for so many days here,

27:57.658 --> 28:00.960
for example.

28:01.160 --> 28:05.607
But every time you see that, acting changes.

28:05.807 --> 28:12.577
And every two, three years the actors also change.

28:12.778 --> 28:15.527
So though the essence is the same going on,

28:15.728 --> 28:21.876
the same thing is now going to be repeated.
Mohammed Sahib’s life is not going to be repeated.

28:22.077 --> 28:26.025
Nor is He going to come in the way he came as a fakir.

28:26.225 --> 28:34.177
No. That has never happened in the history, why will it happen?

28:34.542 --> 28:37.360
So every time whatever has to happen has to be new.

28:37.560 --> 28:47.797
That’s the style the Nature is. It doesn’t
want to bore you say with the same (laughing).

28:49.360 --> 28:54.080
And that kind of life [is] no more needed also.

28:54.280 --> 28:58.271
And thirdly, as the seed grows,

28:58.471 --> 29:03.836
first the roots have to fight a lot to embed the seed,

29:04.040 --> 29:10.118
and then shoot has to fight a lot, but when the tree is there,

29:10.319 --> 29:16.590
then it supports others, it helps others.

29:16.790 --> 29:22.830
It becomes a strong flowering plant or a flowering tree.

29:23.030 --> 29:29.870
So the whole thing is changed every moment, which is no more the seed.

29:30.070 --> 29:35.082
But people want to see
the seed again. Why?

29:36.150 --> 29:42.190
You are identified. It’s very subtle identification.

29:42.390 --> 29:48.008
Christians are more identified with Christ than with Mohammed Sahib.

29:48.230 --> 29:50.590
Why?

29:50.790 --> 29:56.830
While the Muslims are much more identified with Mohammed Sahib.

29:57.030 --> 30:01.142
But why?

30:01.343 --> 30:03.691
Is there any reason?

30:03.892 --> 30:10.525
They equally intensely identified, for no rhyme and reason.

30:11.430 --> 30:16.110
None of Them gave them Realisation.

30:16.310 --> 30:22.270
They told the same thing. But why this identification so much with this?

30:22.470 --> 30:27.370
Now, when you are walking, you are thirsty, you see a river,

30:27.570 --> 30:32.473
whether it is the river

30:32.673 --> 30:38.990
Ganges or Jamuna or any other river, if you are thirsty,  you will drink.

30:39.190 --> 30:41.870
You won’t say, "No, I won’t drink because the Ganges is not here."

30:42.070 --> 30:48.030
Now supposing I, say, in London, "I will
only have the Ganges water." Will I have?

30:48.230 --> 30:50.910
But there are mad people I tell you, even in India.

30:51.110 --> 30:56.376
I was told some people brought the water of Ganges and the clay from there

30:56.577 --> 31:03.990
to clean their hands here, from India. I mean they can do it.

31:09.830 --> 31:12.670
This is what Sahaja Yogis must understand:

31:12.870 --> 31:17.230
that drop out your identifications with the past life.

31:17.430 --> 31:21.230
If you are born a Christian, alright, so what?

31:21.430 --> 31:28.110
Now you are a Sahaja Yogi. If you are born as a Muslim, so what?

31:28.310 --> 31:32.742
Now you are a Sahaja Yogi. The second part, what happens to you,

31:32.943 --> 31:36.074
I’ll tell you when we have the second lecture

31:36.274 --> 31:44.184
that, as a Sahaja Yogi, how things drop out, automatically.

31:44.384 --> 31:46.750
Alright?

31:46.950 --> 31:49.414
So these people

31:49.614 --> 31:53.390
are not the ones who are really following any religion whatsoever.

31:53.590 --> 31:57.550
They are following their ego religion, that’s what.

31:57.750 --> 32:00.430
There’s no religion in this kind of thing.

32:00.630 --> 32:04.955
So all these identifications just should drop out

32:05.156 --> 32:08.882
when you understand.

32:09.083 --> 32:13.538
Only there’s one way of convincing them is to show

32:13.739 --> 32:17.469
that all of them who have died,

32:17.670 --> 32:24.190
who are no more here, have said that Sahaja Yoga is going to come.

32:24.390 --> 32:30.759
That’s the only way you can convince these hard nuts.

32:31.430 --> 32:36.575
This is the problem.

32:46.790 --> 32:51.430
But surprisingly Muslims never talk of Resurrection.

32:51.631 --> 32:54.134
They are not botheredabout Resurrection. They are only worried

32:54.335 --> 32:56.749
about the doomsday, like French.

32:56.950 --> 32:59.630
French are now thinking that doomsday going to come definitely.

32:59.830 --> 33:03.614
I mean somebody asked me, "Are You sure it’s going to come or it’s postponed?"

33:03.814 --> 33:10.019
I said, "Postponed, forever" (laughing).

33:13.910 --> 33:18.154
Very seriously, I tell you. Very serious people asked me that,

33:18.354 --> 33:23.550
"What do you say if doomsday is coming or not?"

33:23.750 --> 33:31.036
And they were quite disappointed because they were banking upon it (laughing).

33:35.990 --> 33:39.439
This could be with anyone. I am just saying French,

33:39.639 --> 33:42.806
because they were French who asked me, but could be anyone.

33:43.007 --> 33:49.353
I mean don’t be identified again.

33:53.430 --> 33:57.636
Like I was telling today that they show advertisements sometimes,

33:57.836 --> 34:04.565
so horrible that they will show as if some miracle is going to happen

34:04.765 --> 34:08.286
and suddenly lot of ice will break, this will happen, that will happen

34:08.487 --> 34:12.964
and what will come out is a lager.

34:13.270 --> 34:17.699
I mean really from sublime to ridiculous. Horrible.

34:17.899 --> 34:22.990
You just can’t understand that. But I really laughed you know one day.

34:23.190 --> 34:26.067
There was a gentleman sitting, he said, "Why did you laugh?"

34:26.268 --> 34:29.150
I said, "What is this? Sublime to ridiculous!" He said, "What do you mean?

34:29.350 --> 34:36.834
I like my beer!" I said, "Sorry!" That’s it.

34:37.190 --> 34:40.670
The identification is like that, you see.

34:40.870 --> 34:47.990
Even ridiculous things start looking so fine if you identified.

34:53.110 --> 34:57.662
I hope all of you are Sahaja Yogis here.

34:57.910 --> 35:04.110
Or they are still Doubting Thomas’s sitting?

35:04.310 --> 35:09.778
They will have a bad time, I must say.

35:10.310 --> 35:15.573
It’s a very powerful session.

35:18.390 --> 35:21.175
Now don’t you worry.

35:21.375 --> 35:26.922
Don’t doubt yourself, it’s alright.

35:30.790 --> 35:35.763
What about other questions? That was a good one.

35:35.990 --> 35:40.772
Don’t depend on their images.

35:41.510 --> 35:47.836
That’s why these days most of the gurus are keeping dadees.

35:51.830 --> 35:56.750
It’s very easy to grow there. I can’t.

35:56.950 --> 36:00.013
But for any person to grow is alright.

36:00.214 --> 36:03.053
When you feel they don’t grow, they can’t put on one.

36:03.053 --> 36:07.976
So do become angry with them?

36:08.350 --> 36:10.911
Yogini: What happens with those people

36:11.111 --> 36:15.371
who got Realisation from you at your programmes,

36:15.571 --> 36:20.670
At your programmes, but they don’t getting to Sahaja Yoga,

36:20.870 --> 36:23.163
what happens with them?

36:23.364 --> 36:26.110
Shri Mataji: They don’t grow, they are dwarves.

36:26.310 --> 36:32.321
Yogini: They just - what’s the meaning of that?

36:32.522 --> 36:39.694
That’s very bad to be a seed which has been sprouted and goes to waste.

36:39.895 --> 36:48.273
Is a real waste, because which is
not sprouted, may one day sprout.

36:49.590 --> 36:53.509
It’s a real waste I tell you. But mostly they come back,

36:53.709 --> 37:00.556
quite dwarf, but come back. They go, come, like that, you see.

37:00.790 --> 37:05.078
There’s no understanding

37:05.278 --> 37:11.790
about the graveness of this kind of a shallow behaviour.

37:11.990 --> 37:15.710
They don’t understand, that’s why they behave like that.

37:15.910 --> 37:20.030
But then they get something horrible, then they come to Sahaja Yoga.

37:20.230 --> 37:23.230
They go into problems then they come, but the progress is so little.

37:23.430 --> 37:29.659
I mean the one who must have come with them goes much higher.

37:34.230 --> 37:37.870
So what is the programme in the evening?

37:38.070 --> 37:40.555
How are you going to do it?

37:40.756 --> 37:42.696
Gavin Brown: Do you mean the one that is written on the programme, Mother?

37:42.905 --> 37:49.143
Shri Mataji: Alright, it’s all organised?

37:53.350 --> 37:59.953
If Sahaja Yogis organise I have to obey! (laughter)

38:05.222 --> 38:08.590
Gavin: In the afternoon it’s a writers meeting with the publisher.

38:08.790 --> 38:10.803
Shri Mataji: What the meeting?
Gavin: Writers.

38:11.004 --> 38:16.432
They said, "Before you arrive." You have arrived though.

38:16.733 --> 38:18.829
Shri Mataji: What was it?

38:19.030 --> 38:23.869
It says, "Writers collective meeting with publisher (venue to be announced).

38:24.070 --> 38:28.576
Or b) Bhajan rehearsal in lecture hall."

38:28.776 --> 38:31.800
Shri Mataji: So who were the writers?

38:32.001 --> 38:35.688
Gavin: It doesn’t say.

38:36.654 --> 38:41.709
(laughter) Then it says, "More spontaneous and unplanned events."

38:42.582 --> 38:46.239
Shri Mataji: Gavin, are you writing poetry?

38:46.440 --> 38:49.710
Gavin: It’s not me who has written, Mother.
Shri Mataji: Who is written? You?

38:49.910 --> 38:51.929
You yourself?
Gavin: This is Jason.

38:52.130 --> 38:54.144
I am just reading it out.

38:54.345 --> 38:57.160
Shri Mataji: They said that, "Likha Mose padel tha…"

38:57.361 --> 39:00.119
The Moses have written and the one who knows about Moses has written,

39:00.319 --> 39:03.469
is only Isa, means Jesus Christ.

39:03.670 --> 39:05.984
So what is it? "Spontaneously…"?

39:06.185 --> 39:13.273
Gavin: "Spontaneous and unplanned events and preparation for Shri Mataji’s arrival."

39:15.453 --> 39:21.587
Shri Mataji: He is playing safe! Alright, then.

39:21.788 --> 39:30.589
Gavin: "Then four o’clock pm, approximately, Shri Mataji arrives.

39:30.790 --> 39:34.792
This is subject to change."

39:35.496 --> 39:37.066
Shri Mataji: Alright, then.

39:37.267 --> 39:39.701
Gavin: Then there’s nothing [scheduled] until seven o’clock.

39:39.901 --> 39:43.437
Shri Mataji: Ah, then, nothing
until seven o’clock? That’s the way.

39:43.638 --> 39:46.590
Now. Should I tell you?

39:46.790 --> 39:50.057
Let’s have it like that, spontaneously.

39:50.265 --> 39:52.731
I have arrived earlier.

39:52.931 --> 40:00.692
So what we do now [is] you have your lunch and rest for a while.

40:01.190 --> 40:05.459
And then, after the lunch, about an hour or so you,

40:05.659 --> 40:09.310
come along and assemble here.

40:09.510 --> 40:13.230
And you have a thing called that ‘Brain Trust’ business.

40:13.430 --> 40:16.755
Where you talk to each other, have a rapport,

40:16.956 --> 40:19.790
ask questions, tell people, like that. It’s a very good thing.

40:19.990 --> 40:22.510
You appoint some people for that.

40:22.710 --> 40:26.510
Go about like that till you have your tea.

40:26.710 --> 40:31.982
Then after tea I’ll take over. Alright?

40:32.957 --> 40:37.115
But that doesn’t mean you should not attend all the rest!

40:37.315 --> 40:41.389
You all should sit down and talk. It helps a lot.

40:41.590 --> 40:50.361
And help each other. Ask questions and things openly.

40:50.996 --> 40:58.880
And then after that is the dinner and after dinner - what time is the tea?

40:59.081 --> 41:00.990
Gavin: There’s no tea as such, Mother.

41:01.205 --> 41:04.829
But the only fixed time is seven o’clock for the barbecue dinner

41:05.029 --> 41:06.765
and then the dancing will be about half past eight.

41:06.965 --> 41:08.709
Shri Mataji: Alright.
And the tea is at what time?

41:08.909 --> 41:13.582
Gavin: I think we can have it about four but there’s nothing written down.

41:13.782 --> 41:17.950
Shri Mataji: Five o’clock? Five o’clock. Say, four thirty five.

41:18.150 --> 41:21.069
Finish it by five, say.

41:21.270 --> 41:25.950
And let’s start at five thirty, to six or seven.

41:26.150 --> 41:28.721
Then we’ll have a barbecue dinner.

41:28.921 --> 41:33.310
And after the barbecue dinner, we’ll have the music program. Alright?

41:33.510 --> 41:40.635
Then tomorrow you can have dhyana, meditation, in the morning

41:40.835 --> 41:47.941
and about, say, you must get up early.

41:50.870 --> 41:55.050
And after that you can get your tea, I don’t know,

41:55.250 --> 41:58.110
whenever you feel like. I don’t know what the style is.

41:58.310 --> 42:02.216
And after the dhyana is over,

42:02.416 --> 42:08.750
then you can come for your breakfast or whatever it is.

42:08.950 --> 42:14.189
And then you have again a little seminar sort of a thing.

42:14.390 --> 42:18.816
This is at twelve [that] you go for is it.

42:19.017 --> 42:23.371
Gavin: Well tomorrow there’s no staff here. We make our own lunch arrangements.

42:23.572 --> 42:27.422
Shri Mataji: Oh, I see. Then it’s alright. Then there’s no problem.

42:27.623 --> 42:29.707
Tomorrow is the puja day,

42:29.907 --> 42:33.550
so you need not have a seminar or anything, anything like that.

42:33.750 --> 42:40.605
We can start our puja say, say…

42:46.089 --> 42:49.150
Should be at ten, about.

42:49.350 --> 42:52.510
And have a food after puja.

42:52.710 --> 42:57.523
That’s how we are: after that, after that, after that.

42:57.724 --> 43:00.270
Alright?

43:00.470 --> 43:05.790
May God bless you.

43:05.990 --> 43:09.230
So can I retire now in my room?

43:09.430 --> 43:12.556
Thank you very much.
