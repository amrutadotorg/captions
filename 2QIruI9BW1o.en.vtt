00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:06.542
It is my immense joy

00:00:06.743 --> 00:00:15.920
to see all of you here from various parts of this world.

00:00:20.287 --> 00:00:23.097
When your heart is so full,

00:00:23.298 --> 00:00:29.454
the words are too poor to carry the intensity.

00:00:30.413 --> 00:00:41.511
I wish you could understand that intensity, through your heart.

00:00:43.633 --> 00:00:48.200
It’s all been arranged, I think, by the Divine,

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.626
that we should meet here all of us

00:00:51.827 --> 00:00:57.228
in such a wonderful surrounding, in the Nature.

00:00:57.429 --> 00:01:01.179
That something great should happen to all of us.

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:10.059
That we should achieve really something great this time.

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:19.743
Now as the time is short, I will tell you, first of all,

00:01:19.944 --> 00:01:25.969
a few things about meditation now,

00:01:26.169 --> 00:01:31.949
then we’ll have two more talks, I hope so.

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:47.358
‘Meditation’ is a very general word. It is not a word that explains

00:01:47.559 --> 00:01:53.519
all the three steps one has to take for meditating.

00:01:53.727 --> 00:02:01.858
But in Sanskrit language, they have very clearly said

00:02:02.058 --> 00:02:07.971
how you have to move in your meditation.

00:02:09.305 --> 00:02:14.639
First is called as dhyana,

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.702
and second is called as dharana,

00:02:18.903 --> 00:02:23.359
and the third is called as samadhi.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:30.009
Luckily Sahaja Yoga is a, such a thing that you get everything in a bundle.

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:34.159
You avoided everything else and you got the samadhi part.

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:41.085
That’s the beauty of it. Firstly the dhyana.

00:02:43.717 --> 00:02:49.921
First, when you have seeking,

00:02:50.121 --> 00:03:02.460
you put your attention towards the object of your worship.

00:03:02.902 --> 00:03:07.372
That’s called as ‘dhyana’.

00:03:07.573 --> 00:03:14.816
And the dharana is the one in which you

00:03:15.017 --> 00:03:20.879
put all your effort, concentrate all your effort.

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:26.381
But this is all drama for people who are not Realised.

00:03:26.903 --> 00:03:34.630
For them it’s just a sort of an acting that they do,

00:03:34.831 --> 00:03:42.879
but for a Realised-soul it is a reality.

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:50.677
So the first, the dhyana, you have to do.

00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:00.980
Some do it of the Form, another of the Formless.

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:08.988
But you are so fortunate that the Formless has become a Form for you.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.406
No problem. You don’t have to go from form to formless

00:04:13.607 --> 00:04:20.273
and from formless to form, it’s all there, in a bundle!

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:36.649
So you concentrate or think of some deity

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:44.489
or some point for nirakar, for the Formless or of nirakar itself.

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:48.739
It’s also mental projection as long as you are not a Realised-soul.

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:58.182
But once you are Realised,
you have to just think of dhyana:

00:04:58.382 --> 00:05:06.170
[on] whom you are going

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:10.810
to concentrate or you can say, meditate on.

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:16.729
But once you start meditating on a person, your attention starts moving.

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:20.619
That is also possible after Realisation.

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:23.787
Though it’s in a bundle, but some people have it, part of it,

00:05:23.987 --> 00:05:30.460
part of it, like that. So when you meditate,

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:38.940
still your attention can get disturbed every moment.

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:44.540
It can happen, depending on the intensity of your concentration.

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:47.499
So there are some Sahaja Yogis, I have seen,

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:54.539
they are cooking, and there’s another one who is meditating.

00:05:54.740 --> 00:06:01.528
The meditating one will say, "Oh I can smell it is burning."

00:06:06.447 --> 00:06:10.459
So there is no dharana.

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:13.419
‘Dhaar’ means a flow, a continuous flow.

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:18.299
So there is no dharana. Dhyana is there, but not dharana.

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:22.151
The second part of it is very important,

00:06:22.351 --> 00:06:33.019
that you have to put your attention continuously onto your deity.

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:36.213
Then you develop a state, which is called as ‘dharana’,

00:06:36.413 --> 00:06:47.419
in which your attention becomes one with the deity.

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:52.539
But when these mature, the third stage of samadhi comes in.

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:58.957
Now for people who think that, without Realisation, they can do it,

00:06:59.158 --> 00:07:04.859
I think they are absolutely mistaken.

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:15.576
But after Realisation also, when the dharana is established,

00:07:15.776 --> 00:07:23.660
you have to get to the position where you become samadhi.

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:28.258
Now, what is that state?

00:07:28.458 --> 00:07:37.046
When that state comes into your mind, then whatever you do,

00:07:37.246 --> 00:07:43.362
the deity that you worship,

00:07:43.562 --> 00:07:48.991
you see that deity in your work.

00:07:49.192 --> 00:07:56.318
Whatever you see, you see the deity giving you the show.

00:07:56.519 --> 00:07:58.700
You can put it like that.

00:07:58.901 --> 00:08:09.180
Whatever you hear, you find the deity telling you the Truth.

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:17.020
Whatever you read, you find there what the deity would tell you.

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:22.945
So in that state, whatever you do

00:08:23.145 --> 00:08:30.540
with your eyes, nose and all these organs,

00:08:30.741 --> 00:08:37.802
all that becomes a kind of a manifestation

00:08:38.002 --> 00:08:43.623
of the deity whom you worship, automatically.

00:08:43.824 --> 00:08:47.099
You don’t have to think, "Now I must concentrate, alright.

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:52.539
I will not have these thoughts, I have to now think about this."

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:54.932
It becomes automatically that.

00:08:55.133 --> 00:08:58.347
You read a book, in that book immediately you find

00:08:58.547 --> 00:09:01.340
what is good for Sahaja Yoga.

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:07.153
If there’s a book, which is anti-God, you discard it.

00:09:07.353 --> 00:09:09.579
Just call Marina there.

00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:22.101
But if you have a problem,

00:09:22.301 --> 00:09:32.380
you see that, "It must be for some lesson to me.

00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:37.740
That it is to teach me some experience."

00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:42.220
It is the manifestation of the deity itself.

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:45.819
For example a lady feels she is going to have an abortion,

00:09:46.019 --> 00:09:49.593
take a position.

00:09:49.793 --> 00:09:54.940
So one person who is not yet in samadhi avasta,

00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:58.965
or condition, will say, "Oh God, I am such a Sahaja Yogi,

00:09:59.165 --> 00:10:04.505
I have done so much for Mother. I went all the way to Pulborough thing,

00:10:04.705 --> 00:10:09.603
and, despite that, see, this is the problem!"

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:15.820
But another would say that, "Alright let me try. I’ll go and tell Mother."

00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:19.739
On the photograph, or maybe telephone, something.

00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:24.940
And he’ll find, to his surprise, that it’s all done.

00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:28.780
It’s perfectly alright.

00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:32.780
This is only possible if you are a Realised-soul, otherwise not possible.

00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:37.475
So the state that is awakened within you is called,

00:10:37.675 --> 00:10:41.278
is a new state of mind, in Sanskrit language

00:10:41.478 --> 00:10:44.676
it has a very beautiful name is ‘Rutumbhara Pradnya’.

00:10:44.877 --> 00:10:49.029
Which is a very difficult name. Rutumbhara Pradnya.

00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:53.820
Rutumbhara means the whole, Rutumbhara is the name of the Nature.

00:10:54.020 --> 00:11:02.975
And that the whole Nature, one feels, is enlightened.

00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:08.877
I’ll give an example: when a child is to be born,

00:11:09.077 --> 00:11:15.730
the mother starts lactating, automatically.

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:22.620
The Nature itself works out for the birth of the child.

00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:27.041
In the same way, when this Rutumbhara Pradnya,

00:11:27.241 --> 00:11:33.803
starts expressing itself - only for Sahaja Yogis, nobody else -

00:11:34.003 --> 00:11:36.500
you are amazed how things work out suddenly.

00:11:36.701 --> 00:11:39.362
Rutumbhara Pradnya it works out.

00:11:39.563 --> 00:11:45.260
Now the time is very short, but I’ll give you an example.

00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:50.434
I came to Brighton,

00:11:50.634 --> 00:11:53.260
and Jason said, "Mother let’s have Guru Puja in Brighton".

00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:58.940
I said, "Alright, have it, but you find out the place."

00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:02.140
So he went to the university, said, "The university people will help,

00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:05.660
but it’s rather small and…" I said, "But ask them".

00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:07.985
"But no, it’s booked on Guru Puja." Then I said,

00:12:08.186 --> 00:12:10.780
"Then what can you do?" He said, "Then what to do Mother?"

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:15.179
I said, "You try somewhere else just now, telephone to somebody else."

00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:17.873
So he went through yellow pages, I don’t know what, and he telephoned,

00:12:18.074 --> 00:12:21.687
and they said, "We have a place, a beautiful place,

00:12:21.887 --> 00:12:27.751
and you come along and have lunch with us."

00:12:27.952 --> 00:12:30.619
And just he went there, he had a very nice lunch,

00:12:30.819 --> 00:12:33.739
they were very happy [that] they were to accommodate everyone.

00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:36.468
They were very nice, and he was amazed

00:12:36.668 --> 00:12:40.229
how everything has worked out so well.

00:12:40.429 --> 00:12:47.600
So the Rutumbhara Pradnya has started working in your favour.

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:50.537
You all tell me, "This is a miracle, that has happened Mother,

00:12:50.738 --> 00:12:54.244
and we don’t know how it has happened!" I’ll give you an example:

00:12:54.444 --> 00:12:57.266
Yesterday, you we were doing something with cement

00:12:57.466 --> 00:13:01.519
and the Italian boy said that we’ll need two bags of cement.

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:05.720
I said, "You carry on, it won’t finish!" Even before I was leaving,

00:13:05.921 --> 00:13:09.122
they were carrying on, still not finished!

00:13:09.322 --> 00:13:14.592
Now cement of all the things. Imagine!

00:13:16.237 --> 00:13:20.433
So this special thing is your own state,

00:13:20.633 --> 00:13:24.704
where you are feeling the oneness with the Nature

00:13:24.904 --> 00:13:27.771
and the Nature is feeling oneness with you.

00:13:27.979 --> 00:13:31.420
So the Divine itself is expressing through Nature,

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:39.022
through various happenings, through various incidents –

00:13:39.222 --> 00:13:47.679
the Love, the protection, the attention that the Divine is giving.

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:50.910
And there’s no end to it.

00:13:51.111 --> 00:13:58.960
It just happens, and people don’t know how it happens.

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:02.320
But that is what is the state of samadhi.

00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:07.360
But there could be people if I tell them,

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:11.360
"Will you do this?" "Oh no Mother! The shop will be closed."

00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:15.053
"Oh, They won’t do it!" "That’s not alright".

00:14:15.254 --> 00:14:18.713
They go on like that. And there are people

00:14:18.913 --> 00:14:22.480
who say, "No! Let’s see. If Mother has said – maybe."

00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:26.238
I’ll give you another simple example, very simple, absolutely gross,

00:14:26.439 --> 00:14:31.920
but it’s there: One day Mr. Shrivastava, he takes one type of tea.

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:36.347
Very English.

00:14:36.547 --> 00:14:41.049
And he wouldn’t like other tea. So he told me, "Oh God,

00:14:41.249 --> 00:14:44.159
we are finished with the tea and what to do tomorrow morning?"

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:46.801
I said, "It’s alright, let us go to the tea shop."

00:14:47.002 --> 00:14:52.160
So he said, "It is eight o’clock in the night and what do you mean?

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:56.479
They’ll all laugh at us! There is no shop at eight o’clock open."

00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:58.640
That tea centre. I said, "Let’s go! What’s the harm.

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:00.799
I am just saying ‘let’s go!’ " But he said,

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.680
"What absurd things you are saying!" I said, "Alright, absurd whatever it is.

00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:05.538
Let’s go!"

00:15:05.738 --> 00:15:09.131
So he wouldn’t listen so I told the driver "Alright, let’s drive down!"

00:15:09.331 --> 00:15:11.840
We went there. And the lights were on.

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:15.839
We said, "Eh! How is it the lights are on?" (laughter)

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:19.435
So we walked in, you see, very peevishly.

00:15:19.635 --> 00:15:22.640
And they all were there standing, "Oh we’ve been waiting for you

00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:25.825
such a long time, you know, and you are the last to come!"

00:15:26.026 --> 00:15:28.639
Just imagine! So I asked my husband.

00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:33.867
He said, "I forgot we had a reception here!" (laughter).

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:40.880
And they said, "You are the last to arrive!"

00:15:41.081 --> 00:15:43.747
And they said, "Alright, doesn’t matter but you’ll have your presents!"

00:15:43.947 --> 00:15:49.621
So they gave us two tins each of tea! (laughter)

00:15:56.680 --> 00:16:00.079
I mean, there are thousand and one examples like that.

00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:02.719
Today like some were trying to push the bed.

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:05.520
The three of them were trying, it would not push.

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:09.280
I said, "Alright, I’ll push it." I just put my Nabhi there.

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:15.276
Just, I didn’t push anything, it just pushed.

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:20.442
Because of the Rutumbhara Pradnya .

00:16:20.643 --> 00:16:23.051
But this is not chamatkar (miracle) or anything.

00:16:23.252 --> 00:16:29.087
It exists in the Divine the capacity to manifest it’s love,

00:16:29.287 --> 00:16:36.180
to show that you are the saints, you are the chosen ones of God.

00:16:36.381 --> 00:16:39.232
But you accept that situation first. But if you behave

00:16:39.433 --> 00:16:42.620
like all other normal people, "Oh God, the shops are closed,

00:16:42.821 --> 00:16:46.586
and that man is so difficult, and I don’t think it will happen",

00:16:46.786 --> 00:16:49.599
never happen.

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:53.055
But you must know you are saints,

00:16:53.255 --> 00:17:02.529
chosen, and given birth by me, the Form and the Formless.

00:17:02.730 --> 00:17:07.360
So this Pradnya is going to manifest, is manifesting every moment,

00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:11.130
be prepared, be happy, welcome it,

00:17:11.331 --> 00:17:17.867
and accept that you are that.
The level is different.

00:17:18.067 --> 00:17:21.820
Was done? Alright?

00:17:22.873 --> 00:17:26.433
Five minutes more.

00:17:28.019 --> 00:17:33.159
I should blame anything that side.

00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:37.239
Alright.

00:17:37.947 --> 00:17:46.040
Now the time has come for Sahaja Yoga to change it’s level.

00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:56.341
We have to change, we have to go higher, the level has to come up.

00:17:56.542 --> 00:18:00.516
But Sahaja Yoga is such a cosmopolitan thing

00:18:00.716 --> 00:18:08.118
that we have got the worst bhoots
to the highest, on the same plate.

00:18:08.824 --> 00:18:12.559
Now, some of them are round ones,

00:18:12.759 --> 00:18:19.599
which are the ego-oriented ones, who roll all the time.

00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:25.360
They don’t know how to raise the plate.
If you raise the plate they’ll roll down.

00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:28.637
So you are frightened you have to hold them.

00:18:28.837 --> 00:18:35.280
And there are some who are squares.

00:18:36.086 --> 00:18:41.475
And the square ones are carrying other squares on their heads, like bhoots.

00:18:41.675 --> 00:18:45.368
So if you raise them they may all topple down,

00:18:45.568 --> 00:18:49.840
or maybe the bhoots might fall off. God knows.

00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:55.520
But there are third type who are prisms, who are like pyramids,

00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:58.971
who are nicely settled down, whatever level you raise them,

00:18:59.171 --> 00:19:04.359
they are stuck there.

00:19:06.428 --> 00:19:14.560
So those who are at the periphery are a problem, definitely, for me,

00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:21.043
because in my compassion, I cannot throw them out.

00:19:22.049 --> 00:19:26.505
And we have to help them to come out,

00:19:26.705 --> 00:19:32.823
by really now, telling them, that they have to rise.

00:19:33.024 --> 00:19:38.950
How long are we to wait for them?

00:19:39.151 --> 00:19:43.774
Everyone has to see that the peripheral people

00:19:43.975 --> 00:19:51.165
are brought in properly so that they don’t go out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:19:51.851 --> 00:19:56.011
Compassion is alright,

00:19:56.211 --> 00:20:04.640
but not at the cost of keeping the level of Sahaja Yoga lower, never.

00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:12.248
We have to raise the level of people
who are well settled in Sahaja Yoga.

00:20:12.448 --> 00:20:16.550
So everybody must try to settle down

00:20:16.750 --> 00:20:23.966
and come up to minimum standards at least.

00:20:24.166 --> 00:20:29.605
Otherwise, I am sorry, many will be sieved out.

00:20:29.805 --> 00:20:32.955
That’s for the five minutes!

00:20:33.155 --> 00:20:37.461
I’ll have another, I think, one hour or so,

00:20:37.661 --> 00:20:40.880
one and a half hour later on today.

00:20:41.081 --> 00:20:45.228
Please. Thank you very much.

00:20:46.898 --> 00:20:53.688
I would say that somebody should translate it if possible.

00:20:56.828 --> 00:20:59.508
Is it possible to translate?

00:20:59.709 --> 00:21:01.714
Yogi: We could translate it afterwards, Mother.

00:21:01.915 --> 00:21:07.108
In French then to be told them Rutumbhara Pradnya and all that.

00:21:07.735 --> 00:21:10.045
Later on you can translate.

00:21:10.246 --> 00:21:18.185
I mean those who have to go for lunch now should be English then.

00:21:22.199 --> 00:21:28.995
Then he can explain it, the first part, as you please, I don’t know.

00:21:29.196 --> 00:21:33.155
Those who are staying here, should not, those who are come, should.

00:21:33.356 --> 00:21:35.888
Is wrong.

00:21:36.089 --> 00:21:44.040
The guests must be looked after, I mean, the other way round.

00:21:46.656 --> 00:21:48.815
Now we have to divide in two halves,

00:21:49.015 --> 00:21:51.242
but I would say those who understand English should go

00:21:51.443 --> 00:21:54.029
because then Gregoire can speak about this

00:21:54.229 --> 00:21:59.305
and somebody can translate also in Italian.

00:21:59.506 --> 00:22:01.727
Gregoire: Shri Mother, I’m sorry,

00:22:01.927 --> 00:22:05.379
but it’s already divided with numbers in two lots,

00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:08.376
so I think the first number has just to go.

00:22:08.577 --> 00:22:11.457
Shri Mataji: Is it already divided?
Gregoire: Yes it’s already…

00:22:11.658 --> 00:22:14.241
Shri Mataji: …organised!!!
Gregoire: Organised.

00:22:14.442 --> 00:22:16.590
Shri Mataji: Oh, I see.

00:22:16.791 --> 00:22:20.818
I didn’t know who is here unhappy.

00:22:21.019 --> 00:22:23.732
Both of you have come?
Yogi: Mother?

00:22:23.933 --> 00:22:26.366
Shri Mataji: Only two of you have come? Yogi: Three.

00:22:26.567 --> 00:22:29.930
Shri Mataji: Who is?
Yogi: Alfredo and Ricardo.

00:22:30.131 --> 00:22:32.787
Shri Mataji: Who?
Yogi: Alfredo and Ricardo.

00:22:32.988 --> 00:22:36.794
Shri Mataji: Good, good. Busy hai! Good. So how are you?

00:22:36.995 --> 00:22:38.509
Yogi: I’m alright now.

00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:41.683
Shri Mataji: ….substantially support Sahaja Yoga.

00:22:41.884 --> 00:22:54.748
Like Dr. Warren has brought a very good extract, I think.

00:22:54.949 --> 00:22:58.365
Is it an extract? Gavin: Yes
you read it Mother, you read it.

00:22:58.566 --> 00:23:07.120
Shri Mataji: Just imagine! He was a Catholic Christian church fellow

00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:13.432
who could say all these things so clearly and see so clearly.

00:23:17.789 --> 00:23:23.096
And this book, you see, Essenes, that a book.

00:23:23.297 --> 00:23:38.088
But now Rustom told me that he has found out, in the Koran,

00:23:38.288 --> 00:23:47.538
that the Kundalini resides in the triangular bone is called as Asus.

00:23:47.739 --> 00:23:50.571
And at the time of Resurrection,

00:23:50.771 --> 00:23:56.286
this will be raised and people will get their Realisation.

00:23:56.486 --> 00:24:00.549
Can you imagine?

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:05.985
The second thing he said, the same thing which has written in these books

00:24:06.185 --> 00:24:12.913
that there are seven firmaments and there are seven powers.

00:24:13.114 --> 00:24:16.161
Can you imagine?

00:24:16.362 --> 00:24:20.658
All that is described in the Koran and what are these Muslims doing

00:24:20.859 --> 00:24:24.420
and what are these Christians doing?

00:24:24.621 --> 00:24:27.378
But even those who knew, the Hindus, so-called,

00:24:27.578 --> 00:24:30.957
what are they doing? Stupid.

00:24:31.157 --> 00:24:34.228
Everybody seems to be stupid.

00:24:34.428 --> 00:24:39.440
You can’t blame those who knew and you can’t blame those did not.

00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:43.141
They are just the same.

00:24:43.341 --> 00:24:49.031
It’s very clearly written all about the seven chakras and everything

00:24:49.231 --> 00:24:51.679
since the Patanjali.

00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:56.992
But who is seeking God?

00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:04.127
But these discoveries are coming up and they are going to substantiate

00:25:04.328 --> 00:25:08.799
and you are going to talk to these people

00:25:08.999 --> 00:25:16.039
about the kind of things they have been doing to the essence of religion.

00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:20.005
But these are authentic things.

00:25:20.205 --> 00:25:25.665
People want to believe into something that has happened.

00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:34.696
That’s a good thing in a way because we have some certificates.

00:25:43.108 --> 00:25:47.040
Nobody wants to ask any questions to me?

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:50.049
Because one third is missing so I would like to speak

00:25:50.249 --> 00:25:55.123
about general things later on.

00:25:56.289 --> 00:25:59.154
Yes, yes.

00:25:59.392 --> 00:26:03.011
Yogi: We were just talking about your comments.

00:26:03.212 --> 00:26:05.911
For example in Islam we were talking about the Mahedi

00:26:06.111 --> 00:26:10.903
who looks like a Muslim with a beard.

00:26:13.648 --> 00:26:16.594
Yes.

00:26:16.795 --> 00:26:21.413
In Islam we were talking about the Mahedi who looks like a Muslim with a beard.

00:26:21.613 --> 00:26:27.080
And in Buddhism they are talking about a Maitreya who is like a man.

00:26:27.281 --> 00:26:31.962
Every religion is talking about a coming who is in their own form,

00:26:32.162 --> 00:26:36.620
I mean, projecting. What about this?

00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:42.063
But they are all talking about your coming.

00:26:42.264 --> 00:26:48.160
Many of these scriptures are mutilated and changed also.

00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:54.890
And Buddha is, of course, is a laughing Buddha.

00:26:55.090 --> 00:26:58.065
They think of ‘laughing Buddha’.

00:26:58.265 --> 00:27:04.320
Then because it was Mohammed Sahib they think of a fakir.

00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:12.854
Because your mind is like a projector,

00:27:13.055 --> 00:27:19.612
and the film is what you have seen before, like Mohammed Sahib.

00:27:19.813 --> 00:27:27.625
So the mind projects it and you get Mohammed Sahib as the image.

00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:33.680
So whatever film you are using, it depends on [that].

00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:40.187
But whatever has happened never happens again.

00:27:41.321 --> 00:27:44.430
So if you have seen with the film, say, for example,

00:27:44.631 --> 00:27:48.720
if you have made a film, it’s made once for all.

00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:53.404
You do not make the same film, do you?

00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:57.458
I mean you are having "Mouse Trap" (play in London theatre) for so many days here,

00:27:57.658 --> 00:28:00.960
for example.

00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:05.607
But every time you see that, acting changes.

00:28:05.807 --> 00:28:12.577
And every two, three years the actors also change.

00:28:12.778 --> 00:28:15.527
So though the essence is the same going on,

00:28:15.728 --> 00:28:21.876
the same thing is now going to be repeated.
Mohammed Sahib’s life is not going to be repeated.

00:28:22.077 --> 00:28:26.025
Nor is He going to come in the way he came as a fakir.

00:28:26.225 --> 00:28:34.177
No. That has never happened in the history, why will it happen?

00:28:34.542 --> 00:28:37.360
So every time whatever has to happen has to be new.

00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:47.797
That’s the style the Nature is. It doesn’t
want to bore you say with the same (laughing).

00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:54.080
And that kind of life [is] no more needed also.

00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:58.271
And thirdly, as the seed grows,

00:28:58.471 --> 00:29:03.836
first the roots have to fight a lot to embed the seed,

00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:10.118
and then shoot has to fight a lot, but when the tree is there,

00:29:10.319 --> 00:29:16.590
then it supports others, it helps others.

00:29:16.790 --> 00:29:22.830
It becomes a strong flowering plant or a flowering tree.

00:29:23.030 --> 00:29:29.870
So the whole thing is changed every moment, which is no more the seed.

00:29:30.070 --> 00:29:35.082
But people want to see
the seed again. Why?

00:29:36.150 --> 00:29:42.190
You are identified. It’s very subtle identification.

00:29:42.390 --> 00:29:48.008
Christians are more identified with Christ than with Mohammed Sahib.

00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:50.590
Why?

00:29:50.790 --> 00:29:56.830
While the Muslims are much more identified with Mohammed Sahib.

00:29:57.030 --> 00:30:01.142
But why?

00:30:01.343 --> 00:30:03.691
Is there any reason?

00:30:03.892 --> 00:30:10.525
They equally intensely identified, for no rhyme and reason.

00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:16.110
None of Them gave them Realisation.

00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:22.270
They told the same thing. But why this identification so much with this?

00:30:22.470 --> 00:30:27.370
Now, when you are walking, you are thirsty, you see a river,

00:30:27.570 --> 00:30:32.473
whether it is the river

00:30:32.673 --> 00:30:38.990
Ganges or Jamuna or any other river, if you are thirsty,  you will drink.

00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:41.870
You won’t say, "No, I won’t drink because the Ganges is not here."

00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:48.030
Now supposing I, say, in London, "I will
only have the Ganges water." Will I have?

00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:50.910
But there are mad people I tell you, even in India.

00:30:51.110 --> 00:30:56.376
I was told some people brought the water of Ganges and the clay from there

00:30:56.577 --> 00:31:03.990
to clean their hands here, from India. I mean they can do it.

00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:12.670
This is what Sahaja Yogis must understand:

00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:17.230
that drop out your identifications with the past life.

00:31:17.430 --> 00:31:21.230
If you are born a Christian, alright, so what?

00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:28.110
Now you are a Sahaja Yogi. If you are born as a Muslim, so what?

00:31:28.310 --> 00:31:32.742
Now you are a Sahaja Yogi. The second part, what happens to you,

00:31:32.943 --> 00:31:36.074
I’ll tell you when we have the second lecture

00:31:36.274 --> 00:31:44.184
that, as a Sahaja Yogi, how things drop out, automatically.

00:31:44.384 --> 00:31:46.750
Alright?

00:31:46.950 --> 00:31:49.414
So these people

00:31:49.614 --> 00:31:53.390
are not the ones who are really following any religion whatsoever.

00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:57.550
They are following their ego religion, that’s what.

00:31:57.750 --> 00:32:00.430
There’s no religion in this kind of thing.

00:32:00.630 --> 00:32:04.955
So all these identifications just should drop out

00:32:05.156 --> 00:32:08.882
when you understand.

00:32:09.083 --> 00:32:13.538
Only there’s one way of convincing them is to show

00:32:13.739 --> 00:32:17.469
that all of them who have died,

00:32:17.670 --> 00:32:24.190
who are no more here, have said that Sahaja Yoga is going to come.

00:32:24.390 --> 00:32:30.759
That’s the only way you can convince these hard nuts.

00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:36.575
This is the problem.

00:32:46.790 --> 00:32:51.430
But surprisingly Muslims never talk of Resurrection.

00:32:51.631 --> 00:32:54.134
They are not botheredabout Resurrection. They are only worried

00:32:54.335 --> 00:32:56.749
about the doomsday, like French.

00:32:56.950 --> 00:32:59.630
French are now thinking that doomsday going to come definitely.

00:32:59.830 --> 00:33:03.614
I mean somebody asked me, "Are You sure it’s going to come or it’s postponed?"

00:33:03.814 --> 00:33:10.019
I said, "Postponed, forever" (laughing).

00:33:13.910 --> 00:33:18.154
Very seriously, I tell you. Very serious people asked me that,

00:33:18.354 --> 00:33:23.550
"What do you say if doomsday is coming or not?"

00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:31.036
And they were quite disappointed because they were banking upon it (laughing).

00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:39.439
This could be with anyone. I am just saying French,

00:33:39.639 --> 00:33:42.806
because they were French who asked me, but could be anyone.

00:33:43.007 --> 00:33:49.353
I mean don’t be identified again.

00:33:53.430 --> 00:33:57.636
Like I was telling today that they show advertisements sometimes,

00:33:57.836 --> 00:34:04.565
so horrible that they will show as if some miracle is going to happen

00:34:04.765 --> 00:34:08.286
and suddenly lot of ice will break, this will happen, that will happen

00:34:08.487 --> 00:34:12.964
and what will come out is a lager.

00:34:13.270 --> 00:34:17.699
I mean really from sublime to ridiculous. Horrible.

00:34:17.899 --> 00:34:22.990
You just can’t understand that. But I really laughed you know one day.

00:34:23.190 --> 00:34:26.067
There was a gentleman sitting, he said, "Why did you laugh?"

00:34:26.268 --> 00:34:29.150
I said, "What is this? Sublime to ridiculous!" He said, "What do you mean?

00:34:29.350 --> 00:34:36.834
I like my beer!" I said, "Sorry!" That’s it.

00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:40.670
The identification is like that, you see.

00:34:40.870 --> 00:34:47.990
Even ridiculous things start looking so fine if you identified.

00:34:53.110 --> 00:34:57.662
I hope all of you are Sahaja Yogis here.

00:34:57.910 --> 00:35:04.110
Or they are still Doubting Thomas’s sitting?

00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:09.778
They will have a bad time, I must say.

00:35:10.310 --> 00:35:15.573
It’s a very powerful session.

00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:21.175
Now don’t you worry.

00:35:21.375 --> 00:35:26.922
Don’t doubt yourself, it’s alright.

00:35:30.790 --> 00:35:35.763
What about other questions? That was a good one.

00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:40.772
Don’t depend on their images.

00:35:41.510 --> 00:35:47.836
That’s why these days most of the gurus are keeping dadees.

00:35:51.830 --> 00:35:56.750
It’s very easy to grow there. I can’t.

00:35:56.950 --> 00:36:00.013
But for any person to grow is alright.

00:36:00.214 --> 00:36:03.053
When you feel they don’t grow, they can’t put on one.

00:36:03.053 --> 00:36:07.976
So do become angry with them?

00:36:08.350 --> 00:36:10.911
Yogini: What happens with those people

00:36:11.111 --> 00:36:15.371
who got Realisation from you at your programmes,

00:36:15.571 --> 00:36:20.670
At your programmes, but they don’t getting to Sahaja Yoga,

00:36:20.870 --> 00:36:23.163
what happens with them?

00:36:23.364 --> 00:36:26.110
Shri Mataji: They don’t grow, they are dwarves.

00:36:26.310 --> 00:36:32.321
Yogini: They just - what’s the meaning of that?

00:36:32.522 --> 00:36:39.694
That’s very bad to be a seed which has been sprouted and goes to waste.

00:36:39.895 --> 00:36:48.273
Is a real waste, because which is
not sprouted, may one day sprout.

00:36:49.590 --> 00:36:53.509
It’s a real waste I tell you. But mostly they come back,

00:36:53.709 --> 00:37:00.556
quite dwarf, but come back. They go, come, like that, you see.

00:37:00.790 --> 00:37:05.078
There’s no understanding

00:37:05.278 --> 00:37:11.790
about the graveness of this kind of a shallow behaviour.

00:37:11.990 --> 00:37:15.710
They don’t understand, that’s why they behave like that.

00:37:15.910 --> 00:37:20.030
But then they get something horrible, then they come to Sahaja Yoga.

00:37:20.230 --> 00:37:23.230
They go into problems then they come, but the progress is so little.

00:37:23.430 --> 00:37:29.659
I mean the one who must have come with them goes much higher.

00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:37.870
So what is the programme in the evening?

00:37:38.070 --> 00:37:40.555
How are you going to do it?

00:37:40.756 --> 00:37:42.696
Gavin Brown: Do you mean the one that is written on the programme, Mother?

00:37:42.905 --> 00:37:49.143
Shri Mataji: Alright, it’s all organised?

00:37:53.350 --> 00:37:59.953
If Sahaja Yogis organise I have to obey! (laughter)

00:38:05.222 --> 00:38:08.590
Gavin: In the afternoon it’s a writers meeting with the publisher.

00:38:08.790 --> 00:38:10.803
Shri Mataji: What the meeting?
Gavin: Writers.

00:38:11.004 --> 00:38:16.432
They said, "Before you arrive." You have arrived though.

00:38:16.733 --> 00:38:18.829
Shri Mataji: What was it?

00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:23.869
It says, "Writers collective meeting with publisher (venue to be announced).

00:38:24.070 --> 00:38:28.576
Or b) Bhajan rehearsal in lecture hall."

00:38:28.776 --> 00:38:31.800
Shri Mataji: So who were the writers?

00:38:32.001 --> 00:38:35.688
Gavin: It doesn’t say.

00:38:36.654 --> 00:38:41.709
(laughter) Then it says, "More spontaneous and unplanned events."

00:38:42.582 --> 00:38:46.239
Shri Mataji: Gavin, are you writing poetry?

00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:49.710
Gavin: It’s not me who has written, Mother.
Shri Mataji: Who is written? You?

00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:51.929
You yourself?
Gavin: This is Jason.

00:38:52.130 --> 00:38:54.144
I am just reading it out.

00:38:54.345 --> 00:38:57.160
Shri Mataji: They said that, "Likha Mose padel tha…"

00:38:57.361 --> 00:39:00.119
The Moses have written and the one who knows about Moses has written,

00:39:00.319 --> 00:39:03.469
is only Isa, means Jesus Christ.

00:39:03.670 --> 00:39:05.984
So what is it? "Spontaneously…"?

00:39:06.185 --> 00:39:13.273
Gavin: "Spontaneous and unplanned events and preparation for Shri Mataji’s arrival."

00:39:15.453 --> 00:39:21.587
Shri Mataji: He is playing safe! Alright, then.

00:39:21.788 --> 00:39:30.589
Gavin: "Then four o’clock pm, approximately, Shri Mataji arrives.

00:39:30.790 --> 00:39:34.792
This is subject to change."

00:39:35.496 --> 00:39:37.066
Shri Mataji: Alright, then.

00:39:37.267 --> 00:39:39.701
Gavin: Then there’s nothing [scheduled] until seven o’clock.

00:39:39.901 --> 00:39:43.437
Shri Mataji: Ah, then, nothing
until seven o’clock? That’s the way.

00:39:43.638 --> 00:39:46.590
Now. Should I tell you?

00:39:46.790 --> 00:39:50.057
Let’s have it like that, spontaneously.

00:39:50.265 --> 00:39:52.731
I have arrived earlier.

00:39:52.931 --> 00:40:00.692
So what we do now [is] you have your lunch and rest for a while.

00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:05.459
And then, after the lunch, about an hour or so you,

00:40:05.659 --> 00:40:09.310
come along and assemble here.

00:40:09.510 --> 00:40:13.230
And you have a thing called that ‘Brain Trust’ business.

00:40:13.430 --> 00:40:16.755
Where you talk to each other, have a rapport,

00:40:16.956 --> 00:40:19.790
ask questions, tell people, like that. It’s a very good thing.

00:40:19.990 --> 00:40:22.510
You appoint some people for that.

00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:26.510
Go about like that till you have your tea.

00:40:26.710 --> 00:40:31.982
Then after tea I’ll take over. Alright?

00:40:32.957 --> 00:40:37.115
But that doesn’t mean you should not attend all the rest!

00:40:37.315 --> 00:40:41.389
You all should sit down and talk. It helps a lot.

00:40:41.590 --> 00:40:50.361
And help each other. Ask questions and things openly.

00:40:50.996 --> 00:40:58.880
And then after that is the dinner and after dinner - what time is the tea?

00:40:59.081 --> 00:41:00.990
Gavin: There’s no tea as such, Mother.

00:41:01.205 --> 00:41:04.829
But the only fixed time is seven o’clock for the barbecue dinner

00:41:05.029 --> 00:41:06.765
and then the dancing will be about half past eight.

00:41:06.965 --> 00:41:08.709
Shri Mataji: Alright.
And the tea is at what time?

00:41:08.909 --> 00:41:13.582
Gavin: I think we can have it about four but there’s nothing written down.

00:41:13.782 --> 00:41:17.950
Shri Mataji: Five o’clock? Five o’clock. Say, four thirty five.

00:41:18.150 --> 00:41:21.069
Finish it by five, say.

00:41:21.270 --> 00:41:25.950
And let’s start at five thirty, to six or seven.

00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:28.721
Then we’ll have a barbecue dinner.

00:41:28.921 --> 00:41:33.310
And after the barbecue dinner, we’ll have the music program. Alright?

00:41:33.510 --> 00:41:40.635
Then tomorrow you can have dhyana, meditation, in the morning

00:41:40.835 --> 00:41:47.941
and about, say, you must get up early.

00:41:50.870 --> 00:41:55.050
And after that you can get your tea, I don’t know,

00:41:55.250 --> 00:41:58.110
whenever you feel like. I don’t know what the style is.

00:41:58.310 --> 00:42:02.216
And after the dhyana is over,

00:42:02.416 --> 00:42:08.750
then you can come for your breakfast or whatever it is.

00:42:08.950 --> 00:42:14.189
And then you have again a little seminar sort of a thing.

00:42:14.390 --> 00:42:18.816
This is at twelve [that] you go for is it.

00:42:19.017 --> 00:42:23.371
Gavin: Well tomorrow there’s no staff here. We make our own lunch arrangements.

00:42:23.572 --> 00:42:27.422
Shri Mataji: Oh, I see. Then it’s alright. Then there’s no problem.

00:42:27.623 --> 00:42:29.707
Tomorrow is the puja day,

00:42:29.907 --> 00:42:33.550
so you need not have a seminar or anything, anything like that.

00:42:33.750 --> 00:42:40.605
We can start our puja say, say…

00:42:46.089 --> 00:42:49.150
Should be at ten, about.

00:42:49.350 --> 00:42:52.510
And have a food after puja.

00:42:52.710 --> 00:42:57.523
That’s how we are: after that, after that, after that.

00:42:57.724 --> 00:43:00.270
Alright?

00:43:00.470 --> 00:43:05.790
May God bless you.

00:43:05.990 --> 00:43:09.230
So can I retire now in my room?

00:43:09.430 --> 00:43:12.556
Thank you very much.
