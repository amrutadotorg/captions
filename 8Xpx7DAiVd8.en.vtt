00:03.305 --> 00:09.804
Today we have gathered here on the right occasion

00:11.846 --> 00:16.846
and very auspicious day to worship Shri Ganesha.

00:21.763 --> 00:24.346
Shri Ganesha is the first Deity that was created

00:27.763 --> 00:32.929
so that the whole Universe is filled with auspiciousness,

00:35.013 --> 00:43.180
with peace, bliss, and spirituality.

00:50.096 --> 00:52.013
He is the source.

00:56.180 --> 00:58.888
He’s the source of spirituality.

01:02.263 --> 01:07.054
As a result of that all other things follow.

01:08.804 --> 01:12.929
Like when it rains and is windy

01:12.929 --> 01:16.888
you feel a coolness in the atmosphere.

01:19.846 --> 01:26.929
In the same way when Shri Ganesha emits His Power

01:28.180 --> 01:32.888
we feel all these three things within and without.

01:35.054 --> 01:44.096
But it has been so unfortunate, specially in the West,

01:44.096 --> 01:54.804
that the most important fundamental Deity

01:54.804 --> 01:58.804
has been completely not only neglected,

01:58.804 --> 02:02.888
but insulted and crucified.

02:06.054 --> 02:09.346
So today though I did not want to say anything

02:11.013 --> 02:15.804
to upset you people, but I must tell you

02:15.846 --> 02:23.221
that worshiping Shri Ganesha means there has to be

02:23.263 --> 02:26.013
a thorough cleansing within you.

02:28.346 --> 02:30.763
When you worship Shri Ganesha

02:31.929 --> 02:37.888
keep your mind clean, keep your heart clean,

02:39.096 --> 02:41.013
keep your being clean -

02:41.013 --> 02:46.096
no thoughts of lust and greed should come up.

02:48.180 --> 02:50.180
Actually when the Kundalini rises

02:50.221 --> 02:54.096
Ganesha had to be awakened within us,

02:54.138 --> 02:56.763
the innocence has to come up –

02:56.804 --> 03:07.096
which obliterates all such degrading ideas within us.

03:09.346 --> 03:14.888
If ascent has to be achieved, we have to understand

03:14.929 --> 03:20.305
that we have to mature.

03:25.971 --> 03:27.888
People are sick now.

03:27.929 --> 03:32.971
All over the western life one feels they are sick.

03:33.096 --> 03:38.263
Sick because they have never recognized Shri Ganesha.

03:40.138 --> 03:45.846
If one Freud came that doesn’t mean that you should accept him.

03:45.888 --> 03:53.929
But you did - as if it was such an important thing to be done;

03:56.263 --> 03:59.096
there was nothing more important than that.

04:05.138 --> 04:11.013
So today we are faced with our power of ascent

04:12.138 --> 04:15.305
and the power of conditionings we have had.

04:16.054 --> 04:18.221
When Freud talks of conditioning he didn’t know

04:18.263 --> 04:21.305
he was putting another type of horrid conditionings on you,

04:21.346 --> 04:22.346
terrible.

04:30.054 --> 04:33.305
Sex is not important for human beings at all,

04:36.054 --> 04:38.221
is not at all important.

04:41.804 --> 04:44.346
It is only when you want to have children

04:44.763 --> 04:47.221
actually a human being

04:47.263 --> 04:50.929
who is of the highest level will indulge into a sex.

04:53.846 --> 04:56.929
The lure, the romance, this nonsense and all that

04:56.929 --> 05:01.888
doesn’t exist in a pure mind; it’s all a human creation.

05:06.971 --> 05:15.888
And this servility one has to that is so much surprising,

05:17.221 --> 05:23.221
it comes from a very low grading within us.

05:25.013 --> 05:28.888
It comes from the low-graded human beings

05:33.971 --> 05:37.846
that one becomes servile to it.

05:38.846 --> 05:41.096
You should be the master of that.

05:44.929 --> 05:48.929
And today when I see around Myself, in the West,

05:48.971 --> 05:52.096
which is also part and parcel of the same creation,

05:54.305 --> 06:02.888
so much of sickness that has come, I am really aghast,

06:05.305 --> 06:09.804
how to turn your attention now to the maturity of sex.

06:12.138 --> 06:16.888
When the sex matures you become a father, a mother,

06:17.846 --> 06:20.054
and a pure personality.

06:23.971 --> 06:27.221
When you hear about a ninety-year old woman

06:27.263 --> 06:29.054
marrying a nineteen-year old boy,

06:29.180 --> 06:30.888
I mean, you just don’t understand,

06:30.888 --> 06:35.929
this is - what sort of a society it has been created in this world,

06:35.929 --> 06:41.138
this kind of a stupid behaviour?

06:41.846 --> 06:43.929
We have to mature ourselves.

06:47.263 --> 06:51.846
That doesn’t mean I’m saying austerity at young age,

06:53.263 --> 06:58.305
that doesn’t mean that. Another absurdity is that.

06:58.346 --> 07:01.804
But of course you must mature;

07:01.804 --> 07:03.971
you need a tapasya for that.

07:07.096 --> 07:10.138
Unimportant thing when become important

07:10.138 --> 07:16.096
and such unimportant thing that they’re just like anything

07:16.138 --> 07:17.929
that we have, like we have hair.

07:17.929 --> 07:22.054
Even if you lose hair it means something.

07:22.888 --> 07:26.305
But if you lose sex, what’s wrong with it? It’s very good.

07:26.346 --> 07:29.846
Good riddance of bad rubbish.

07:29.971 --> 07:32.929
Such a waste of energy.

07:38.013 --> 07:43.263
So much interest, so much of a precious attention,

07:43.263 --> 07:46.346
so much of auspiciousness is spent

07:46.763 --> 07:49.263
in this kind of a nonsensical thing.

07:53.138 --> 07:57.013
So to worship Ganesha one has to understand

07:57.013 --> 07:58.054
we have to mature.

08:01.013 --> 08:03.263
Maturity has to come within us.

08:07.263 --> 08:10.971
We have to go deeper within ourselves;

08:11.013 --> 08:17.180
our attention has to go deeper within ourselves, spontaneously.

08:18.096 --> 08:23.929
How do we achieve the depth if we are still like worms?

08:30.013 --> 08:34.013
Otherwise it’s a great sort of a sacrifice

08:34.013 --> 08:39.013
or a pressure on people.

08:42.305 --> 08:49.054
These tags and these pressures have been very costly

08:49.054 --> 08:52.138
for you people, very costly.

08:52.138 --> 08:55.180
You have paid through so much;

08:56.846 --> 09:00.763
you have gone through so much. For what?

09:08.846 --> 09:12.346
So the priorities have to change

09:12.346 --> 09:15.221
if Shri Ganesha is to be worshipped.

09:16.305 --> 09:21.096
What are we worshipping today is the innocence within us.

09:22.846 --> 09:28.846
We are worshipping that is auspicious, which is innocent.

09:32.096 --> 09:36.138
Innocence, which is deep down within us - that’s our character,

09:36.138 --> 09:38.971
that’s our nature, that’s what we are born with –

09:41.763 --> 09:48.096
is the basic of this whole Creation;

09:49.888 --> 09:54.054
is the essence of this Creation.

09:57.971 --> 10:02.804
So when matter becomes active, all right, reproduction starts,

10:04.263 --> 10:08.804
animal stage comes in, then comes the stage of human beings

10:08.804 --> 10:11.305
who are primitive, then comes the stage

10:11.305 --> 10:15.054
where human beings are developed.

10:15.096 --> 10:19.804
Not the way what we understand of the developed world, horrible.

10:19.846 --> 10:22.971
I’ll never call them developed by any chance at all.

10:23.929 --> 10:26.763
What is development is not outside.

10:26.804 --> 10:30.221
What is the within development one has to see.

10:30.263 --> 10:33.221
What have we grown inside?

10:35.888 --> 10:39.013
What have we got inside ourselves?

10:41.096 --> 10:47.929
Anything that gross, big, is plastic, of that kind.

10:49.846 --> 10:52.971
The one which hasn’t got any inner power grown,

10:53.013 --> 10:55.346
say, for example, I give you a mango.

10:55.346 --> 10:57.054
I said, “All right, now you eat it.”

10:58.346 --> 11:02.221
And you see it just has the cover and nothing inside it,

11:02.221 --> 11:07.263
what will you eat? Will you eat that plastic?

11:11.305 --> 11:17.263
Anything that grown like that is plastic, is dead.

11:19.305 --> 11:21.971
What is the substance inside, let’s see.

11:26.013 --> 11:28.888
What is our substance within ourselves?

11:33.096 --> 11:38.096
This is what Christ preached – morality point.

11:39.138 --> 11:42.221
So important for Him it was.

11:42.263 --> 11:46.346
Because after dharma, which was a balance,

11:46.346 --> 11:49.888
where of course morality is very important,

11:50.263 --> 11:57.221
but it was necessary for Christ to talk of the innate,

11:57.221 --> 12:02.305
deeper morality, which is a part and parcel of a being,

12:02.346 --> 12:06.138
it is not just taught, or told, or frightened

12:06.138 --> 12:09.096
because there’s a fear of God and wrath of God.

12:09.096 --> 12:12.763
But it should be your own innate light,

12:12.763 --> 12:15.888
that’s why Christ talked about it.

12:17.846 --> 12:27.013
And the same Christ was used to demolish innocence.

12:31.888 --> 12:36.763
And I would not say that people were not warned.

12:36.804 --> 12:39.346
Freud was not the only person who was born.

12:40.971 --> 12:46.096
The other day I went to Prado in Spain

12:46.138 --> 12:50.305
and I saw paintings after paintings of the hell.

12:50.305 --> 12:54.346
And all these modern times we see those lanky pankies

12:54.763 --> 12:57.346
going around without clothes, sort of people were shown

12:57.763 --> 13:00.263
with all kind of funny things, stupid things they were doing.

13:00.305 --> 13:04.180
This was Bosch. I was surprised, a German, Bosch,

13:04.221 --> 13:07.888
who showed all this nonsense there, very clearly - way to hell,

13:07.929 --> 13:10.929
then the attack of the death, all these things.

13:11.346 --> 13:14.221
I mean he was quite a recent person.

13:14.263 --> 13:22.054
If you call Blake as a madcap, so what about Bosch?

13:22.054 --> 13:26.846
Everybody’s a madcap, except for the stupid useless people.

13:29.971 --> 13:37.804
So much warning has come for us. For example, we can say,

13:37.846 --> 13:40.763
since long we know about hell.

13:41.096 --> 13:45.138
Mahavira of all the persons wrote so clearly about hell.

13:45.180 --> 13:47.971
This is hell.

13:53.846 --> 14:02.138
But in the West the priorities are absolutely upside down.

14:05.013 --> 14:09.763
What is your power? Just think of it. Think within yourself.

14:09.804 --> 14:12.971
Is it mental power that’s important?

14:13.013 --> 14:15.971
I have told you mental power has nothing to do,

14:16.013 --> 14:19.263
because it is just linear, it moves in one direction, falls off,

14:19.305 --> 14:27.305
comes back to you. It has no substance in it.

14:27.305 --> 14:34.054
It’s just a mind projection, plastic.

14:36.305 --> 14:40.096
What is your emotional power?

14:40.138 --> 14:44.346
Emotions that you have takes you where?

14:46.971 --> 14:51.138
See you have emotions for, even good emotions you have.

14:51.221 --> 14:54.846
Say, you love your wife very much.

14:57.138 --> 14:58.888
Where does it take you?

14:58.929 --> 15:03.846
There was a poet called Tulsidasa who loved his wife very much

15:03.846 --> 15:06.221
and she had gone to her mother’s place.

15:07.221 --> 15:13.763
So he couldn’t bear it and went to see her

15:13.804 --> 15:21.054
and he climbed over to her balcony and she got a fright.

15:21.096 --> 15:22.054
She said, “How did you climb?”

15:22.054 --> 15:24.138
He said, “You had put a rope there.” She said, “No.”

15:24.180 --> 15:26.888
And they saw it was a big snake hanging.

15:29.054 --> 15:32.846
So she said, “The amount of love you have for me,

15:32.846 --> 15:35.221
if you have that for God, where will you be?”

15:41.138 --> 15:44.929
So where does these emotions take you - to frustration,

15:44.971 --> 15:48.138
to unhappiness, to our destruction.

15:51.138 --> 15:55.180
The mental power gives you a horrible thing called ego,

15:55.180 --> 15:57.888
which destroys others.

15:57.888 --> 16:00.138
And the emotional power gives you

16:00.180 --> 16:05.305
nothing but crying, weeping, and always feeling unhappy,

16:05.346 --> 16:09.096
“Oh, I have done so much of emotional investment

16:09.138 --> 16:12.138
on such and such person and what did I get?”

16:18.346 --> 16:21.929
So it is not absolute, it’s relative.

16:23.263 --> 16:26.763
And mentally you are zero if you cannot destroy others.

16:26.804 --> 16:29.888
Emotionally you are zero

16:29.929 --> 16:37.888
because you cannot overpower people with your emotions.

16:42.305 --> 16:47.804
So what is your power? Where does your power lie?

16:50.763 --> 16:55.971
It lies in the Spirit. But even before the Spirit is achieved,

16:55.971 --> 17:02.180
what is your power? Is Kundalini? She’s sleeping.

17:02.221 --> 17:05.263
Then what is your power?

17:05.263 --> 17:11.096
Is your chastity.

17:12.305 --> 17:18.763
If a man is chaste, chaste temperament he has

17:18.804 --> 17:31.346
and he stands up in his chastity, it acts, it works.

17:37.305 --> 17:43.763
But first of all chastity pays dividend in your good health.

17:47.763 --> 17:49.929
From the face of a person you can say

17:49.971 --> 17:52.138
that this person is a chaste man.

17:52.138 --> 18:02.929
Like in our Shastras used to say a Saint or a brahmachari,

18:02.929 --> 18:05.221
the one who has never had sex in life,

18:05.221 --> 18:07.929
always shining on his face.

18:07.971 --> 18:13.263
And as we say that the greatest brahmachari was Shri Krishna

18:13.305 --> 18:15.804
who has so many wives.

18:22.263 --> 18:27.929
Because no wastage of energy, no wastage of attention is on that.

18:27.929 --> 18:30.346
So the whole energy is inside.

18:30.763 --> 18:34.263
I will say today as I was coming by car it was raining,

18:34.305 --> 18:39.138
it was windy, it was very cold, but we were in the car,

18:39.138 --> 18:46.846
nothing affected us, because we were quite warm inside the car,

18:46.846 --> 18:50.846
ourselves. We passed through everything, nothing touched us,

18:50.888 --> 18:57.221
nothing bothered us, we came away, everything fine. How?

18:57.221 --> 19:02.346
Because we kept to our own vehicle

19:02.346 --> 19:07.138
and the vehicle we have is our chastity.

19:11.888 --> 19:14.804
We are so particular that others must respect us,

19:14.846 --> 19:18.846
other must give us homage, otherwise we get into tempers.

19:22.263 --> 19:29.263
Did you respect yourself? Do you respect yourself?

19:35.096 --> 19:38.221
It sounds sometimes to people in the West

19:38.263 --> 19:44.221
that Mother is very trying to preach about Indian culture.

19:44.221 --> 19:47.221
Many people think that way.

19:49.221 --> 19:53.346
But I say that one has to learn science from the West.

19:53.763 --> 19:57.888
All right. One has to learn other things from the West,

19:57.929 --> 20:00.971
aesthetics, of course.

20:02.263 --> 20:06.846
Paintings and art, maybe, colour schemes.

20:08.929 --> 20:11.888
But culture you better learn from Indians.

20:16.971 --> 20:20.888
There’s dearth of culture, no culture at all, I find.

20:22.263 --> 20:27.054
What is this culture where a woman is supposed to expose her body?

20:27.054 --> 20:32.346
Is a prostitute’s culture, simple as that. Face it up.

20:43.096 --> 20:47.305
Where a woman is not supposed to respect her private parts

20:47.346 --> 20:52.804
is no culture whatsoever in the aesthetics of the Divine.

20:55.888 --> 21:02.804
So much so today that they are making a film showing Mary

21:02.804 --> 21:08.138
to be a prostitute. I mean, this is where you have ended up.

21:08.888 --> 21:14.013
In India even if you say this they’ll beat you nicely - anyone,

21:14.054 --> 21:16.180
whether Muslim, Hindu, Christian.

21:17.846 --> 21:22.221
I mean, shocking to hear that the way they talk about Christ.

21:22.221 --> 21:25.180
I mean, to an Indian it gives a shock.

21:25.221 --> 21:31.763
How can you talk because once you give up your chastity

21:31.804 --> 21:36.846
you can not understand that there can be someone

21:36.846 --> 21:39.221
who is absolutely chaste.

21:40.096 --> 21:42.846
For a thief everybody is a thief.

21:47.221 --> 21:51.929
Because you don’t have that respect for your chastity

21:51.929 --> 21:55.971
you can not imagine what Christ could have been.

21:55.971 --> 21:58.096
You can not imagine, you can not accept.

22:02.054 --> 22:05.263
Unbearable things are said about Christ.

22:05.305 --> 22:07.846
I tell you, unbearable, I don’t know.

22:07.888 --> 22:15.263
I’ve faced His crucifixion, which was unbearable as it was.

22:15.305 --> 22:19.804
But this kind of a thing you say about somebody;

22:19.804 --> 22:24.054
to an Indian woman if you pass such a remark,

22:24.054 --> 22:27.013
to an Indian ordinary woman, she would commit suicide.

22:39.846 --> 22:42.971
Is never said that anybody comes and says,

22:43.013 --> 22:45.013
“You looking very beautiful.” It’s all right,

22:45.054 --> 22:47.138
you can say to your mother, “you’re looking nice,” is all right,

22:48.054 --> 22:50.138
that’s different. But you don’t say to any woman like that.

23:00.096 --> 23:03.305
You have to turn yourself out.

23:03.346 --> 23:09.929
And this is one of the reasons why

23:09.929 --> 23:12.929
people are very hot-tempered.

23:16.305 --> 23:23.096
The magnet within you is Shri Ganesha.

23:26.096 --> 23:28.971
Many people know that I have a great sense of direction.

23:29.013 --> 23:32.263
That comes through this magnet which is perfect.

23:32.305 --> 23:40.846
This magnet is the one which keeps you sticking or adjusted

23:40.846 --> 23:45.888
or all the time pointed towards Spirit.

23:45.888 --> 23:53.013
If you don’t have the sense of chastity you will dangle this way,

23:53.054 --> 23:56.096
that way. Suddenly you become a very good Sahaja Yogi,

23:56.096 --> 23:57.305
tomorrow you become a devil –

23:58.929 --> 24:05.013
because there’s nothing that keeps you binding

24:08.263 --> 24:17.054
to the great idea of the Spirit. Let us face it up.

24:17.096 --> 24:20.180
Now the time has come for all of us, all the Sahaja Yogis,

24:22.054 --> 24:26.888
that the greatest thing within us is not sex, but is chastity.

24:37.305 --> 24:40.929
And that’s what will mature you.

24:45.971 --> 24:51.221
It’s very amazing how some people were behaving in Bordi,

24:51.221 --> 24:53.346
I came to know about it, I was amazed,

24:53.346 --> 24:57.763
how could they behave like this before the villagers of Bordi,

24:57.763 --> 24:59.846
who are innocent, simple people?

25:04.971 --> 25:09.888
But the best part of it that when you indulge into frivolous

25:09.929 --> 25:16.013
and nonsensical behaviour, insulting your chastity,

25:16.054 --> 25:19.221
you really lag in the action of it.

25:21.763 --> 25:24.346
Like, if you fritter away your petrol, your car can’t move,

25:24.346 --> 25:26.346
it’s like that, something happens to you.

25:30.929 --> 25:33.180
All the time you go on pinching people

25:33.180 --> 25:36.929
and frivolously talking to each other and to,

25:36.971 --> 25:39.888
what is the need to do all these, I just don’t understand.

25:39.888 --> 25:42.305
And then end up in the divorce case.

25:44.305 --> 25:46.346
Once I had gone to a Selfridges,

25:46.763 --> 25:48.846
I must tell you a very interesting story.

25:48.846 --> 25:53.346
And in such a crowd there were two people, man and woman,

25:53.763 --> 25:55.138
kissing each other all the time,

25:55.138 --> 25:57.096
least bothered there are other people

25:57.138 --> 26:00.054
who are also going on the same escalator.

26:00.054 --> 26:04.013
Escalator they were kissing, in the thing they were kissing,

26:04.013 --> 26:07.263
I mean, torturing all the Indians who were there

26:07.263 --> 26:10.929
or maybe the other people, Chinese, for example, Egyptians.

26:10.971 --> 26:19.305
Such an exhibition going on. And I saw them next time.

26:19.346 --> 26:22.929
They were not kissing.

26:22.971 --> 26:24.054
I said, “What happened?”

26:24.096 --> 26:25.846
“We are divorced.”

26:28.763 --> 26:30.846
I said, “Why were you kissing that day so much?”

26:30.888 --> 26:34.180
So they said, “Because we were going to be divorced,

26:34.221 --> 26:36.804
so wanted to have the last bit of it.”

26:38.054 --> 26:42.929
What a level it is. Imagine what a level. What love,

26:42.929 --> 26:47.929
what feeling you have for anyone, nothing of the kind.

26:52.054 --> 26:54.096
All the time quarrelling with each other,

26:54.138 --> 27:01.305
ending up in the divorce cases and showing off all this.

27:01.346 --> 27:06.971
Any deep personality doesn’t show these things outside.

27:06.971 --> 27:11.888
Of course, I’m told here that here in the public school it is said

27:11.888 --> 27:14.221
that you should never show your emotions outside.

27:16.346 --> 27:18.804
But otherwise you can show anything else,

27:18.804 --> 27:23.804
ridiculous or shameless. But not your emotions.

27:25.180 --> 27:28.180
What an absurd place it is.

27:33.180 --> 27:35.971
You have accepted all these values

27:37.763 --> 27:40.221
just like sheep, without thinking about it.

27:46.096 --> 27:49.763
Like I was in France, one girl came and she was crying.

27:49.763 --> 27:51.971
She said, “I will - horrid, horrid,

27:52.013 --> 27:56.054
I will never go to these psychologists.”

27:56.096 --> 27:57.804
So I said, “Why?”

27:57.846 --> 28:00.221
“They were saying dirty things about my father.”

28:01.346 --> 28:03.221
Imagine.

28:07.180 --> 28:11.138
And people accepted those ideas of this horrible Freud.

28:14.888 --> 28:19.013
Is basically wrong. Whether it is historically they are,

28:19.054 --> 28:20.888
or whatever it is, you better give it up.

28:22.346 --> 28:28.263
Whatever wrong is wrong, in the Divine.

28:28.305 --> 28:31.305
Whatever is right is right, in the Divine.

28:36.054 --> 28:39.971
But there’s a real objection now,

28:39.971 --> 28:42.221
that people when they go abroad,

28:42.221 --> 28:45.846
husband and wife and this and that, they kiss each other

28:45.888 --> 28:47.763
and tease each other. What is the need?

28:48.763 --> 28:51.180
You kiss the person and come and tell Me against that person,

28:51.180 --> 28:59.263
I’ve seen it. If there has to be some self-preservation,

28:59.305 --> 29:04.013
this has to be your chastity, your privacy.

29:05.263 --> 29:08.971
That’s why you have no willpower to do anything, no willpower.

29:08.971 --> 29:11.763
Let some stupid fellow come and tell you something,

29:11.763 --> 29:15.096
you’ll say, “All right. We accept.”

29:18.804 --> 29:22.971
What is the essence of your personality – is your chastity.

29:26.263 --> 29:29.929
And in Sahaja Yoga you can re-establish everything

29:29.929 --> 29:32.804
whatever you have lost, you can.

29:33.263 --> 29:36.054
That’s why the depth is lacking.

29:42.263 --> 29:46.096
And this is the reason there is no consistency

29:46.138 --> 29:50.971
in the temperament of people, no consistency.

29:53.180 --> 29:57.221
Now you’ll get twelve hundred people for My lecture

29:57.263 --> 30:00.846
and next day not even one, all lost.

30:01.763 --> 30:05.180
Because there’s no base, you know. Like a loose connection.

30:06.804 --> 30:11.763
There’s no connection, connection point is your chastity.

30:14.221 --> 30:18.346
So there is no consistency, sthaapayati is not there.

30:20.138 --> 30:22.846
If you tell them, “You have to get up in the morning,

30:22.888 --> 30:28.138
have a bath, do some puja,” it’s too much for them.

30:34.971 --> 30:42.096
But if you tell, say an Indian ladies or Me, if you say that

30:42.096 --> 30:44.138
“that you wear such and such dress,”

30:44.180 --> 30:50.846
I just can’t, I just can’t, no, not possible. Is not possible.

30:50.846 --> 30:53.888
I can keep the whole night awake,

30:53.929 --> 30:56.305
but that thing I can not do, just cannot do it.

30:59.138 --> 31:03.263
So the priorities are changed because where is your attention.

31:07.138 --> 31:10.305
You have everything within you.

31:10.305 --> 31:16.096
You are the storehouse of chastity, which is your power.

31:16.096 --> 31:21.096
Everything within you, nothing has gone out, it’s all there.

31:21.096 --> 31:27.763
All that fragrance is within you. Is all preserved,

31:27.763 --> 31:32.804
don’t condemn yourself. And you are so fortunate

31:32.804 --> 31:35.054
I’m here to tell you all about it.

31:35.096 --> 31:38.180
You are so fortunate I am with you.

31:38.221 --> 31:40.305
Do you understand that point?

31:42.846 --> 31:44.305
You don’t have to go to Himalayas;

31:44.346 --> 31:47.180
you don’t have to stand on your heads.

31:50.013 --> 31:52.346
You don’t have to do anything like that.

31:52.346 --> 31:57.804
You see, formerly these saints used to sit, you know,

31:57.804 --> 32:04.054
you won’t believe, in the cold frozen water or on the Himalayas

32:04.054 --> 32:08.096
in the open they used to sit for hours together

32:08.138 --> 32:13.054
Now that’s not necessary.

32:13.096 --> 32:18.096
It’s all made very easy. But change your priorities now.

32:22.054 --> 32:26.180
The whole attention once goes to your own Spirit

32:26.221 --> 32:33.971
you’ll be surprised the whole chart will change.

32:36.013 --> 32:40.263
What’s the most important thing? To meditate every day.

32:42.929 --> 32:46.263
I have seen people who want to do some course, say, for example,

32:46.263 --> 32:48.138
I told that “You better do some course.”

32:48.180 --> 32:52.305
Every day they will go for that course and join that class

32:52.346 --> 32:56.013
and they will work it out and they’ll pass that course

32:56.013 --> 32:59.804
and do it up and finish it.

32:59.804 --> 33:03.804
But meditation they cannot do regularly.

33:07.846 --> 33:12.846
But now there’s a little gap you should understand,

33:14.013 --> 33:24.054
that once we get the inkling of that joy which is eternal,

33:25.763 --> 33:29.013
we start moving towards that more and more,

33:29.054 --> 33:32.263
more and more and establishing ourselves

33:32.263 --> 33:35.263
in the ocean of that joy.

33:35.305 --> 33:41.846
A little. You see, when somebody wants you to swim,

33:41.888 --> 33:46.138
you are frightened, you don’t want to do it,

33:46.138 --> 33:49.096
you are very happy on the gross shore,

33:49.138 --> 33:53.138
you don’t want to swim. Somebody pushes you,

33:53.180 --> 33:55.929
again you are back, “No, baba, I can not do it.”

33:55.971 --> 34:01.013
But once you learn to swim you enjoy that swimming.

34:02.180 --> 34:05.305
And when you like it then you want to do it every day,

34:05.305 --> 34:07.888
regularly, religiously.

34:09.971 --> 34:15.138
So there’s a little gap, which has to be achieved.

34:15.180 --> 34:21.180
Second point is that as I’ve been always saying,

34:21.221 --> 34:25.180
you are lotuses, but under a mire.

34:25.180 --> 34:27.929
And you know what mire is,

34:27.971 --> 34:35.138
while India is the ocean, so it’s very easy for the lotuses

34:35.138 --> 34:38.096
to come out of the water.

34:38.096 --> 34:41.971
But to come out of the mire is very difficult.

34:45.846 --> 34:48.971
Say, somebody falls in the mire.

34:49.888 --> 34:52.804
If you kick it, you go deeper.

34:52.804 --> 34:55.763
If you try to do anything you go deeper.

34:55.804 --> 34:59.846
Best thing is to keep watching it and still.

34:59.846 --> 35:04.221
And that’s the best way – is to witness yourself.

35:04.263 --> 35:07.888
But your attention is not all right, how will you witness?

35:07.888 --> 35:10.804
Attention is: somebody’s going that side –

35:10.804 --> 35:13.180
that person you’ll see. Another person going that –

35:13.180 --> 35:15.763
that person you’ll see, must see every person.

35:17.054 --> 35:22.013
But you don’t see the flowers, you don’t see the trees,

35:22.054 --> 35:25.888
you don’t see the Mother Earth, you don’t see anything.

35:25.888 --> 35:34.888
What you see is something hopelessly bad, worse than you.

35:40.096 --> 35:43.054
Today is the day they say one should not see the moon.

35:44.346 --> 35:48.138
If you see the moon it becomes inauspicious

35:48.138 --> 35:50.929
and you get a bad name. They say Shri Krishna saw the moon

35:50.929 --> 35:54.804
and then He got a bad name; He was ranchordas,

35:54.846 --> 35:57.180
means He had to run away from the battlefield.

35:57.180 --> 35:59.180
But that was His trick, He had to run away.

35:59.221 --> 36:00.888
So you are not supposed to see the moon.

36:00.888 --> 36:03.221
The reason is, why it is said,

36:03.221 --> 36:05.929
that today we have to see Shri Ganesh,

36:05.971 --> 36:08.263
who is the Mother Earth,

36:09.804 --> 36:11.305
who acts through Mother Earth.

36:11.305 --> 36:16.221
Most of the things that we have are from the Mother Earth.

36:18.888 --> 36:21.180
So this time you must see the Mother Earth,

36:21.180 --> 36:27.804
the Kundalini and Shri Ganesh, today.

36:28.929 --> 36:33.138
The Mother Earth has created Shri Ganesha.

36:33.138 --> 36:37.763
So you don’t see anything outside, you don’t even see the moon.

36:37.804 --> 36:41.138
Just see the Mother Earth.

36:50.096 --> 36:53.346
Because the Mother Earth in Her love

36:53.346 --> 36:57.096
and compassion has done so much for us,

36:57.096 --> 36:59.971
your Kundalini has done so much for you.

37:02.929 --> 37:08.096
And Her Son, Who is the innocence within us,

37:08.096 --> 37:14.346
is to be worshipped today because He has done the maximum.

37:14.346 --> 37:19.346
Despite all the insults we have put on Him, all the ridicule,

37:19.763 --> 37:23.846
all the filth, all kinds of nonsense,

37:23.846 --> 37:27.971
still He stands up like a little child to amuse us.

37:34.971 --> 37:38.138
If Shri Ganesha is within you become like a child,

37:38.180 --> 37:44.096
childlike innocence, you don’t get angry with somebody

37:44.138 --> 37:47.180
like a dog barks; there are some Sahaja Yogis I know

37:47.221 --> 37:51.763
who all the time barking, just like dogs or beggars in India.

37:56.846 --> 38:01.138
But you become like a child who is very sweet,

38:01.180 --> 38:04.054
who always tries to amuse you,

38:04.096 --> 38:07.054
always tries to say nice things,

38:07.096 --> 38:12.763
always tries to make you feel happy. The source of such joy.

38:16.846 --> 38:21.054
And that’s how you become a source of joy,

38:21.096 --> 38:27.054
source of happiness, source of fulfilment.

38:31.305 --> 38:35.221
All the time bubbling with laughter and happiness,

38:35.263 --> 38:42.804
bubbling with beautiful things. How the children amuse you,

38:42.804 --> 38:44.888
just see and watch.

38:44.888 --> 38:49.221
How they come round with little-little hands,

38:49.263 --> 38:51.305
how they work it out.

38:54.971 --> 38:58.096
How they know what is the right thing.

38:58.096 --> 39:01.929
A child who is a Realized soul is much more sensible

39:01.929 --> 39:04.138
than a grown up person, I’ve seen that.

39:06.763 --> 39:10.138
Like My youngest granddaughter was about, I think,

39:10.138 --> 39:16.096
three years of age and the maid was folding My sari

39:16.096 --> 39:19.763
and by mistake she put it on the ground.

39:19.763 --> 39:24.804
This child just couldn’t bear it. She just lifted the sari,

39:24.804 --> 39:28.971
put it to her head and put it on the sofa.

39:28.971 --> 39:31.929
She said, “What you mean by putting this sari on the ground,

39:31.971 --> 39:33.888
what you do know about my Grandmother?

39:33.929 --> 39:36.305
She is the Goddess of Goddesses

39:36.346 --> 39:39.096
and you put Her sari on the ground.

39:40.346 --> 39:46.971
The dogs are going to bite you now,” she said, “Be careful.”

39:47.013 --> 39:51.096
And she again went and put the sari, kissed it and kissed it

39:51.096 --> 39:54.929
and said, “Mother, forgive her, Grandmother, please,

39:54.971 --> 39:58.846
forgive this woman, she doesn’t know what she’s done to You”.

40:04.013 --> 40:13.013
But that sensitivity comes from the depth of your chastity.

40:19.971 --> 40:22.221
You listen to the children and you’ll be amazed

40:22.221 --> 40:26.180
how they talk and what they say, how they behave,

40:26.221 --> 40:29.804
how they try to amuse you. I mean,

40:29.804 --> 40:31.929
in the West children are very much spoiled, I must say,

40:31.929 --> 40:34.346
they do not amuse you so much, they trouble you quite a lot.

40:36.180 --> 40:40.763
Because again, again the same thing.

40:42.054 --> 40:44.804
If the father and mother don’t have chastity,

40:44.846 --> 40:50.054
the children don’t feel all right, they don’t feel peaceful,

40:50.096 --> 40:52.888
they’ll become restless, and then they develop

40:52.929 --> 40:55.138
the same restlessness within themselves.

40:55.180 --> 41:00.221
A chaste man can never get possessed, take it from Me,

41:00.221 --> 41:08.763
can never get possessed. You might be very intelligent,

41:08.763 --> 41:11.221
you might be anything, you might be a great writer,

41:11.263 --> 41:14.263
but you can get possessed. But a chaste man,

41:14.305 --> 41:17.054
an ordinary chaste person can never get possessed.

41:17.054 --> 41:18.971
Bhoots are afraid of chaste people.

41:18.971 --> 41:22.846
If one chaste person is going on the road, all the bhoots run away.

41:26.971 --> 41:32.096
They just run away. At least I’ve known many cases

41:32.096 --> 41:35.763
but some of them I can tell you,

41:35.763 --> 41:41.846
that there were three of them,

41:41.888 --> 41:51.221
who used to go by motorcycle in the night

41:51.263 --> 41:53.263
about twelve o’clock on a road.

41:56.013 --> 42:02.096
And some people who were possessed wrote letters to Me,

42:02.096 --> 42:08.888
saying that “Please don’t allow them to go there in the night,

42:08.888 --> 42:11.138
because where should we go and stay?”

42:11.180 --> 42:16.305
I was amazed. These are the people

42:16.305 --> 42:18.971
who were possessed by some sort of horrible bhoots

42:18.971 --> 42:22.180
who used to go and rest on these trees in the night

42:22.180 --> 42:25.346
where these three persons used to go on the motorcycle

42:25.763 --> 42:28.096
and they actually wrote letters to Me.

42:28.096 --> 42:30.971
Very possessed people, I knew them, saying that,

42:30.971 --> 42:35.180
“Ask them not to go that way, because where are we to live?”

42:36.804 --> 42:40.305
And they were like mad, mad people themselves.

42:40.346 --> 42:42.305
I said, “Why did you write like this?”

42:42.346 --> 42:46.305
They said, “These people go that way and they trouble us.”

42:54.013 --> 43:01.221
And the negative within us disappears

43:01.263 --> 43:04.180
with the light of Shri Ganesha.

43:08.763 --> 43:11.971
You can see it so clearly in another person.

43:13.346 --> 43:16.804
If you don’t have chastity you can never see

43:16.804 --> 43:19.804
who is unchaste or chaste, you can not.

43:19.804 --> 43:22.888
Everybody just the same, “Very good, very good,

43:22.888 --> 43:24.763
very nice person, very nice person”.

43:27.846 --> 43:33.346
I mean real possessed people are certified as very good people,

43:33.763 --> 43:37.888
in Sahaja Yoga also sometimes and I start wondering,

43:37.888 --> 43:42.846
“What’s happening, what is it? How is it these people

43:42.888 --> 43:49.971
are certified as that? Can’t they feel it?” There’s no light.

43:51.346 --> 43:53.346
Even if you get your Realization,

43:53.763 --> 44:00.263
even if your Spirit is working out your collective consciousness,

44:00.305 --> 44:03.221
even if you are giving Self Realization to others,

44:03.263 --> 44:07.138
you are nowhere if you have no chastity.

44:12.263 --> 44:16.096
That’s like a broken glass which is trying to reflect something;

44:16.138 --> 44:18.305
it can never give the right picture.

44:20.054 --> 44:24.763
It’s so important. And I have to tell you this now.

44:24.804 --> 44:29.263
The time has come for Me to tell you – this is the snag in our life.

44:32.180 --> 44:36.263
First thing people will ask, “Whom I’m going to marry?”

44:36.263 --> 44:43.138
What is such a hurry? Of course, marriage I call it

44:43.138 --> 44:45.846
an auspicious thing, marriage should be there,

44:45.846 --> 44:48.804
there should be a collective sanction, everything, but for what?

44:50.180 --> 44:55.138
To adore the chastity within us. Then they are married,

44:55.180 --> 44:57.846
then they have children. Then they want to have a house,

44:57.888 --> 44:59.346
then they want to have this.

44:59.763 --> 45:04.054
There’s whole such an insular business goes on, and on, and on,

45:04.054 --> 45:07.888
and the light of your life doesn’t spread.

45:12.846 --> 45:16.054
But I’ve known people who were just in the hell

45:16.096 --> 45:18.763
and have come out and have spread light,

45:18.804 --> 45:26.804
beautiful meteoric heights they have achieved.

45:26.804 --> 45:28.346
I’ve seen people like that.

45:32.763 --> 45:36.763
So today you have come to worship Shri Ganesha - within yourself.

45:36.763 --> 45:40.263
What is Me to worship as Ganesha I don’t understand.

45:44.096 --> 45:50.013
Because I’m That. When you are worshiping Me

45:50.054 --> 45:53.138
you want to have that Shri Ganesh within you awakened.

45:56.888 --> 45:59.305
Let that be awakened within you.

45:59.305 --> 46:04.763
Let what I say becomes the mantra to awaken that within you,

46:04.804 --> 46:11.763
so that as My children you enjoy the bliss of chastity

46:11.804 --> 46:16.888
as I have enjoyed all My human life and all My Divine lives.

46:19.013 --> 46:22.263
You enjoy the same quantity, that’s what I want.

46:22.305 --> 46:25.096
At least you should have the taste of it.

46:30.180 --> 46:32.096
I’m telling you about something

46:32.096 --> 46:34.096
which you may not have heard before.

46:34.096 --> 46:36.846
But you never heard about Kundalini also.

46:36.888 --> 46:40.929
You had never heard about Self Realization like this.

46:42.096 --> 46:47.263
But today I think by chance, absolutely in a Sahaja way,

46:47.263 --> 46:52.263
this Puja was arranged. I was to have this Puja in Bombay.

46:52.305 --> 46:57.221
It was all organized; people were all willing to come there

46:57.221 --> 47:03.221
to do this puja. I mean, a Ganesha Puja in England

47:03.221 --> 47:08.763
or in the West is so important that I thought better have it one,

47:08.804 --> 47:13.929
without the right time in Rome,

47:13.971 --> 47:19.180
which is one of the basic things

47:19.180 --> 47:22.013
which has ruined the chastity of human beings.

47:25.763 --> 47:29.763
Romans started it and others carried on.

47:30.763 --> 47:43.804
But it was to be here in Brighton at the Lotus Feet of Sadashiva.

47:43.846 --> 47:47.221
But the English must know

47:48.763 --> 47:53.888
that they have got such a golden land

47:53.929 --> 48:00.305
and they don’t deserve it. They have to deserve it.

48:02.221 --> 48:07.180
Imagine, you are living in the land of Sadashiva

48:09.346 --> 48:13.971
where even water beads also the snow –

48:14.013 --> 48:17.180
means like distilled water, clean, clear, white.

48:20.138 --> 48:22.888
Where Shri Ganesha is the One

48:24.346 --> 48:27.804
Who washes the feet of His Father.

48:30.263 --> 48:35.763
Where the chastity itself resides as your Mother.

48:38.138 --> 48:43.346
And you have to deserve that coveted position.

48:46.138 --> 48:49.221
English Sahaja Yogis have to come up very much.

48:50.305 --> 48:53.763
Just the opposite English were.

48:57.013 --> 49:02.138
Coming from Sadashiva’s land just the opposite.

49:02.138 --> 49:12.971
Tremendous arrogance, arrogance so horrible,

49:13.013 --> 49:16.221
which one can not think in Shiva’s place.

49:23.138 --> 49:27.013
All unchaste people are arrogant.

49:28.096 --> 49:31.054
Otherwise, how can they forgive themselves?

49:33.888 --> 49:37.180
You talk to any prostitute, in two minutes you’ll find out

49:37.180 --> 49:39.346
she’s a prostitute because she’s extremely arrogant,

49:39.346 --> 49:42.929
“What’s wrong? I’m a prostitute, so what?”

49:53.221 --> 49:58.221
Arrogance is a sign of unchaste personality.

50:01.096 --> 50:03.846
And such a person also becomes insular

50:03.888 --> 50:09.763
because he’s ashamed, ashamed to face others.

50:14.221 --> 50:17.096
But a chaste personality is open,

50:17.138 --> 50:19.846
why should he be afraid of anyone?

50:22.138 --> 50:24.888
Talks to everyone nicely,

50:24.888 --> 50:29.888
kind to everyone in all innocence and simplicity

50:29.929 --> 50:33.221
without falling in love in every third person you come across.

50:44.763 --> 50:52.346
And that, one has to realize that this country is given to you

50:52.346 --> 50:58.054
with a purpose and if you do not come up to that level,

50:58.054 --> 51:00.138
you’ll be thrown away.

51:09.096 --> 51:15.763
So respecting your chastity is real respecting Me,

51:15.804 --> 51:19.971
because I reside within you as chastity.

51:23.804 --> 51:27.346
If Shri Ganesha is the auspiciousness,

51:27.346 --> 51:31.054
I reside within you as chastity.

51:35.221 --> 51:37.305
Chastity is never aggressive,

51:37.346 --> 51:42.804
is never harsh, because there’s no need, you know.

51:45.929 --> 51:49.263
No need, you are so powerful, you are so powerful,

51:49.305 --> 51:51.971
that there is no need to aggress anyone.

51:52.013 --> 51:54.263
Why should you aggress, you are not frightened of anyone.

51:54.305 --> 52:01.180
It’s so generous, it’s so kind, it’s so beautiful,

52:03.763 --> 52:11.096
always fresh and young, yet so sublime and so dignified.

52:16.180 --> 52:19.054
Now twelve years have passed since I’ve been here.

52:19.054 --> 52:24.221
Two more years, very intense work is needed,

52:24.263 --> 52:29.763
within and without. Within we have to work very hard

52:29.763 --> 52:32.013
for these two years, very hard,

52:32.013 --> 52:35.013
real tapasya we have to go into,

52:38.263 --> 52:42.888
all of us, whether men or women.

52:48.346 --> 52:51.305
And then we’ll see.

52:53.846 --> 53:01.096
I can say that, we have done good job,

53:02.804 --> 53:09.929
with little jump, courage and faith we can achieve a lot.

53:10.763 --> 53:12.846
Have faith in yourself.

53:16.054 --> 53:24.763
Not mental faith but actual chastity is faith.

53:28.763 --> 53:32.346
Chastity is the consolidation of your faith.

53:37.054 --> 53:40.096
When you have faith in God, you are chaste.

53:40.138 --> 53:43.221
When you have faith in yourself you are chaste.

53:43.221 --> 53:46.013
You have faith in your wife, you are chaste.

53:46.013 --> 53:47.804
Why should you have faith in your wife?

53:47.804 --> 53:51.888
Because you are a chaste person, how can she be unchaste?

53:51.929 --> 53:57.221
Your faith in your child - is chastity, because you are chaste,

53:57.263 --> 54:00.180
how can your child be anything else?

54:04.763 --> 54:08.846
Crystalline form of faith is chastity.

54:10.096 --> 54:15.221
And that you can have even before Realization. Many have.

54:16.180 --> 54:23.263
Actually like the camphor, which, you see,

54:24.804 --> 54:28.763
is volatile and evaporates into the fragrance,

54:28.804 --> 54:36.054
in the same way we can say chastity acts into faith.

54:36.763 --> 54:39.221
If you don’t have chastity you cannot have faith,

54:39.263 --> 54:41.804
in anything.

54:43.096 --> 54:46.180
Because either you are dealing with your emotions

54:46.221 --> 54:48.138
that you are emotionally attached to Me

54:48.138 --> 54:50.346
or maybe you are mentally attached to Me.

54:51.013 --> 54:56.138
But if you have sense of chastity faith will be apparent.

54:56.180 --> 54:59.096
Within yourself you don’t have to have faith,

54:59.138 --> 55:02.804
“Now Mother I will have faith within myself.” You cannot.

55:06.846 --> 55:11.263
Faith is something, which is volatile

55:14.138 --> 55:19.971
and the volatile fragrance comes from chastity.

55:22.846 --> 55:27.763
So from today we are not going to look at the stars or the moon,

55:27.763 --> 55:30.346
but you are going to look at the Mother Earth.

55:33.013 --> 55:39.180
In the Universe She represents the Kundalini,

55:39.180 --> 55:47.971
is nothing but chastity. She’s just chastity.

55:48.763 --> 55:55.929
Can you believe it? What a power.

56:01.888 --> 56:06.929
Motherhood, everything is chastity.

56:09.929 --> 56:13.888
Fatherhood, any relationship is chastity.

56:17.763 --> 56:21.929
Purity is again the fragrance of chastity.

56:23.054 --> 56:27.763
Goodness, compassion, everything comes from chastity,

56:27.763 --> 56:30.305
a sense of chastity, which is not mental.

56:30.305 --> 56:32.929
If you are mentally chaste, you can be horrid.

56:34.138 --> 56:37.971
Like some of the nuns are or some of those people

56:38.013 --> 56:39.888
who are austere, not that.

56:39.929 --> 56:45.929
Chastity is an innate built-in Kundalini within you,

56:49.263 --> 56:56.971
which acts because it understands Me.

56:56.971 --> 56:59.763
She understands Me. She knows Me,

56:59.804 --> 57:02.263
She’s part and parcel of Me, It’s My reflection.

57:04.846 --> 57:08.888
So make your Kundalini strong by being chaste.

57:11.138 --> 57:15.180
People try to do things to look very attractive and this and that.

57:15.180 --> 57:17.763
Don’t waste your energy like this;

57:17.804 --> 57:19.888
you are saints, live like saints.

57:24.054 --> 57:30.013
Traditionally as we live, we have to live that way

57:30.013 --> 57:34.138
and evolve out of the tradition; don’t do something new,

57:34.180 --> 57:37.346
something absurd, nonsensical.

57:38.221 --> 57:40.263
We don’t have to attract anyone.

57:40.263 --> 57:44.971
Chastity is the fragrance in the flower,

57:46.096 --> 57:49.013
which attracts the bees,

57:50.804 --> 57:53.221
is the honey of the flower,

57:53.263 --> 57:56.971
is the essence of our existence.

58:07.013 --> 58:11.096
So this time you are all coming to India,

58:12.096 --> 58:19.013
I have to request you to respect Me by not misbehaving.

58:20.013 --> 58:25.305
Not childishly behaving in the manner you see in the pictures

58:25.346 --> 58:27.346
and the films and all that nonsense.

58:27.346 --> 58:29.804
You are above all that.

58:35.221 --> 58:46.221
Attention, achievements are to be seen

58:48.763 --> 58:52.846
from the seat of your chastity.

58:54.846 --> 58:57.054
We can’t leave our seats,

58:57.804 --> 59:00.888
whether we are acclaimed or not makes no difference.

59:00.929 --> 59:02.180
We can’t leave our seat.

59:02.221 --> 59:06.138
Like all these avadhootas they’ll say,

59:06.180 --> 59:09.221
takiya sodaa sana - means we’ll not leave our seats.

59:09.263 --> 59:19.846
We are in our seats. This is our seat, in the lotus.

59:21.888 --> 59:29.346
We can’t leave the lotus. We are sitting in the lotus.

59:30.763 --> 59:36.305
That’s our seat. Then all these nonsensical things

59:36.346 --> 59:38.804
that you have acquired will drop out.

59:38.804 --> 59:40.346
You’ll see you’ll become beautiful being.

59:45.013 --> 59:49.180
All bhoots will run away, all catches will run away.

59:53.138 --> 59:57.013
But is not austerity, again and again I’m telling you.

59:58.888 --> 01:00:06.305
It is respect of your Being. As you respect Me outside,

01:00:06.346 --> 01:00:14.138
you respect Me within. As simple as that.

01:00:14.180 --> 01:00:21.346
Today is a great day for us to be worshipping Shri Ganesh.

01:00:24.138 --> 01:00:27.346
He is the first and the foremost to be worshipped.

01:00:33.888 --> 01:00:37.763
And when you worship Him, you must realize

01:00:38.846 --> 01:00:41.804
that you are worshipping His manifestation as well,

01:00:41.846 --> 01:00:46.763
that is of Christ. Anybody who talks cheaply about Christ,

01:00:47.804 --> 01:00:49.929
you should abhor such a person.

01:00:51.263 --> 01:00:55.013
You cannot intellectualize Christ. Anybody who does it,

01:00:55.054 --> 01:00:57.180
just have nothing to do with that person.

01:01:02.263 --> 01:01:07.846
Christ is innocence.

01:01:10.929 --> 01:01:14.013
If you don’t have the depth of your chastity

01:01:14.054 --> 01:01:18.054
you can’t understand Him. You cannot worship Him.

01:01:24.929 --> 01:01:28.221
That’s the best they could do, is to finish your chastity

01:01:28.221 --> 01:01:30.305
so that you never recognize Him.

01:01:39.846 --> 01:01:44.138
All that comes to you through your meditative efforts.

01:01:44.138 --> 01:01:49.138
Now the effort is to be just that you have to be meditative.

01:01:49.180 --> 01:01:54.305
That’s all. Keep your meditation on.

01:01:54.346 --> 01:01:56.846
Try to be meditative. See things.

01:01:56.846 --> 01:02:00.054
What is witness state is nothing but that you are meditative.

01:02:04.054 --> 01:02:12.138
So I have decided also that I’ll meet the Brighton people

01:02:12.138 --> 01:02:20.263
here tomorrow morning and I will meet all the English people

01:02:20.263 --> 01:02:24.054
if possible day after tomorrow evening

01:02:26.096 --> 01:02:33.221
to tell them how important it is for them to achieve

01:02:34.804 --> 01:02:47.929
that state of purity. I think it’s working out.

01:02:47.929 --> 01:02:50.221
I really work very hard,

01:02:50.263 --> 01:02:53.096
you have no idea how much I work hard.

01:02:53.138 --> 01:02:57.971
But this is also they said that, is an idea that people think

01:02:57.971 --> 01:03:00.305
that others should do all their work.

01:03:01.305 --> 01:03:04.846
This is like pound saving, this saving, that saving

01:03:04.888 --> 01:03:10.221
and also labour saving. Let Mother do all the job for us.

01:03:10.263 --> 01:03:13.180
Mother is looking after us. She should get up in the morning.

01:03:13.221 --> 01:03:14.971
She should do meditation.

01:03:20.846 --> 01:03:23.221
There is no saving.

01:03:24.346 --> 01:03:29.096
You can save everything else if you just know

01:03:29.138 --> 01:03:35.846
how to save your Spirit. Only your ascent is important.

01:03:35.846 --> 01:03:38.929
Once you ascend, everything is saved.

01:03:40.138 --> 01:03:42.263
But first save yourself.

01:03:44.305 --> 01:03:48.929
For that you have to put in effort. You have to work hard.

01:03:50.180 --> 01:03:54.305
You have to go deep into you, evolve yourself.

01:03:54.346 --> 01:04:00.180
You are quite capable of it. Do not blame anyone;

01:04:00.180 --> 01:04:03.888
do not blame your wife, mother, father, country anything.

01:04:03.888 --> 01:04:06.305
Everyone can work it out.

01:04:06.305 --> 01:04:09.763
Don’t see other people, see yourself,

01:04:09.763 --> 01:04:12.305
“How far I have gone? What have I contributed?

01:04:14.013 --> 01:04:17.138
Let me go ahead with it.” Every one of you.

01:04:19.846 --> 01:04:21.929
I am thankful that all the people

01:04:21.971 --> 01:04:25.013
have come from all over England.

01:04:26.054 --> 01:04:28.221
It was right thing to do it in a way,

01:04:29.888 --> 01:04:34.346
but this country must be created of that level

01:04:35.138 --> 01:04:38.888
that it becomes pilgrimage for everybody to come here.

01:04:42.971 --> 01:04:44.804
On the contrary it should not happen

01:04:44.846 --> 01:04:46.180
that once they come to England,

01:04:46.221 --> 01:04:48.180
after that they never come to Sahaja Yoga.

01:04:49.096 --> 01:04:57.305
Could happen, could happen with the arrogance

01:04:57.305 --> 01:05:01.096
that people have may be that it might become like that,

01:05:01.346 --> 01:05:03.305
that once they come here they’ll say,

01:05:03.346 --> 01:05:05.888
“No more Sahaja Yoga, had enough of it.”

01:05:08.346 --> 01:05:12.263
The other way round in India, once they go to India they stick on it.

01:05:13.846 --> 01:05:17.305
I have known some people that they came to England

01:05:17.305 --> 01:05:20.221
and the way they, some of the Sahaja Yogis behaved

01:05:20.263 --> 01:05:24.054
and some of the ashrams run, they just ran away.

01:05:24.096 --> 01:05:25.180
“Mother nothing doing,

01:05:25.221 --> 01:05:27.888
we are not going to be in Sahaja Yoga anymore

01:05:27.888 --> 01:05:31.804
after seeing your developed Sahaja Yogis in England

01:05:31.846 --> 01:05:33.888
where you have worked for twelve years.”

01:05:37.096 --> 01:05:44.846
So today we are sitting on this beautiful land of England

01:05:46.138 --> 01:05:51.180
and we have certain debts to be paid,

01:05:52.305 --> 01:05:55.221
to be born in this country,

01:05:56.846 --> 01:06:02.221
and the debt is that we have to be great Sahaja Yogis.

01:06:05.263 --> 01:06:09.138
You can make out, very easily, who is a great Sahaja Yogi.

01:06:09.138 --> 01:06:13.929
When you say that, “shut that window,”

01:06:14.846 --> 01:06:17.929
you’ll find most of them will be sitting looking at others.

01:06:17.971 --> 01:06:21.346
I don’t say they are all English but could be.

01:06:27.221 --> 01:06:32.221
Make others work is not the way.

01:06:32.221 --> 01:06:35.054
You have to be really very dedicated.

01:06:35.096 --> 01:06:38.846
You are not of that level, believe Me you are not of that level.

01:06:38.846 --> 01:06:42.054
Don’t look at other people who are here.

01:06:42.054 --> 01:06:44.929
You are very different type of people. You are special people.

01:06:47.763 --> 01:06:55.305
Try to be alert, respect yourself because you are English

01:06:55.305 --> 01:06:58.929
and that you have a special responsibility.

01:07:01.888 --> 01:07:06.263
So may God bless you.

01:07:56.263 --> 01:08:00.971
All the way he has brought the water of River Godhavari

01:08:00.971 --> 01:08:06.804
which flows in the Nasik, in the river, Nasik.

01:08:07.763 --> 01:08:11.263
You see you know that where Shri Rama and Shri Sita

01:08:11.263 --> 01:08:14.013
and Lakshmana all lived there in Nasik.

01:08:15.846 --> 01:08:20.388
And this river is called as the Ganges of the south. Godhavari.

01:08:23.180 --> 01:08:29.763
He got the water from Godhavari. See the vibrations flowing.

01:08:31.804 --> 01:08:35.138
In the country where the rivers even are mantras,

01:08:35.138 --> 01:08:41.305
their names are mantras - the whole credit goes to the Saints,

01:08:44.263 --> 01:08:54.221
to the people who lived so religiously and so much full of purity

01:08:54.221 --> 01:08:57.971
that the rivers, even if you take their names the vibration comes.

01:09:03.221 --> 01:09:09.138
See? Why not one day Thames becomes like that?

01:09:09.180 --> 01:09:17.013
Through your punyas it should be.

01:09:17.929 --> 01:09:33.263
Every particle of this earth should become vibrated

01:09:34.929 --> 01:09:37.221
through your punyas only.

01:09:45.054 --> 01:09:51.846
Now we have to see that Shri Ganesha state.

01:09:52.929 --> 01:09:57.013
The people who have to worship, we have to see

01:09:57.013 --> 01:09:59.804
who are the people who have to worship.

01:10:02.971 --> 01:10:05.013
Very difficult situation.

01:10:40.096 --> 01:10:44.138
Get the small children, that’s the best.

01:10:45.346 --> 01:10:47.971
Come along. Nira. Come along.

01:10:52.180 --> 01:10:57.888
Yes, yes you both come along.

01:10:59.763 --> 01:11:09.221
Very good. Great. Below ten years. All right. Sit down.

01:11:28.971 --> 01:11:32.054
All of them should be below ten years.

01:11:44.971 --> 01:11:48.054
Not below two but below ten.

01:11:48.054 --> 01:11:51.054
All right. Come, come, come, all of you.

01:12:03.096 --> 01:12:15.929
Very good children, must say.

01:12:15.929 --> 01:12:18.013
Tremendous they are. Aren’t they?

01:12:18.013 --> 01:12:24.846
What we are going to do is to wash Mataji´s Feet.

01:12:24.846 --> 01:12:28.013
Alright? How do we wash, she is putting water on my Feet

01:12:28.013 --> 01:12:30.263
and you just have to rub. Alright.

01:12:30.263 --> 01:12:32.846
Come along, four at the time.

01:12:32.846 --> 01:12:34.221
Now who are the four?

01:12:34.263 --> 01:12:37.929
She will put the water,

01:12:37.929 --> 01:12:41.054
you rub, now you rub It,

01:12:41.054 --> 01:12:43.929
you rub My Foot.
