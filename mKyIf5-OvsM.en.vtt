00:00:06.976 --> 00:00:10.146
If you take bath with cold water you can never catch cold

00:00:10.266 --> 00:00:12.383
because the temperature is the same.

00:00:12.504 --> 00:00:16.030
For a while you will feel it’s cold water, but it’s very good

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:18.825
– those people who take bath with cold water.

00:00:18.945 --> 00:00:22.953
Did you get hot water to have baths?

00:00:23.898 --> 00:00:25.382
Where?

00:00:27.554 --> 00:00:31.734
Yogi: In Rahuri. Even in Brahmapuri.

00:00:31.898 --> 00:00:34.833
Shri Mataji: You had hot water? That’s very wrong.

00:00:34.953 --> 00:00:38.083
That’s the reason [you got sick]. That explains it.

00:00:38.203 --> 00:00:40.482
If you have to take bath with hot water

00:00:40.602 --> 00:00:44.086
then you must get into your bed.

00:00:45.023 --> 00:00:48.216
If you have to take it in the open,

00:00:48.336 --> 00:00:52.477
sure shot you will get temperature. Absolutely sure shot.

00:00:53.797 --> 00:00:57.458
This is a very simple thing which I don’t know how you don’t know.

00:00:57.578 --> 00:01:02.594
You should never take your bath in the open

00:01:03.406 --> 00:01:05.289
with the hot water.

00:01:06.813 --> 00:01:10.857
That’s sure shot. I mean, in the school supposing

00:01:10.977 --> 00:01:14.028
some boy doesn’t want to go, then what he does,

00:01:14.148 --> 00:01:17.333
he keeps the window open and takes his bath with hot water

00:01:17.453 --> 00:01:21.422
– finished! – he gets a temperature immediately the next day.

00:01:24.007 --> 00:01:26.535
So in Brahmapuri if they have given you hot water,

00:01:26.655 --> 00:01:29.725
you should not have taken bath. That was wrong.

00:01:30.938 --> 00:01:33.114
Even if you had got it. I mean, river Ganges,

00:01:33.234 --> 00:01:36.703
I don’t know how many have been to River Ganges?

00:01:37.023 --> 00:01:42.138
You have been. Now the water is freezing cold I tell you,

00:01:42.258 --> 00:01:44.724
it’s absolutely freezing cold.

00:01:44.844 --> 00:01:48.318
When you put your foot you will just push it back, it’s so cold.

00:01:48.438 --> 00:01:52.969
But people get into it. Slowly, slowly, they just move; slip into it.

00:01:53.094 --> 00:01:58.153
And when you come out your cheeks are red like apples!

00:01:58.273 --> 00:02:00.427
It’s so very cold. Isn’t it?

00:02:00.547 --> 00:02:04.536
But nothing happens. Nobody catches cold or anything.

00:02:04.656 --> 00:02:07.333
So in the running water is the cleanest and

00:02:07.453 --> 00:02:10.732
where you could get in, get into cold water.

00:02:10.852 --> 00:02:13.934
Otherwise, even if you have to take a hot water bath,

00:02:14.054 --> 00:02:16.075
take it in the night or maybe

00:02:16.195 --> 00:02:20.052
at the time when you can go off into your bed.

00:02:20.172 --> 00:02:22.892
In England also people take their baths in the night

00:02:23.012 --> 00:02:24.568
mostly and get into bed.

00:02:24.688 --> 00:02:27.638
Supposing you take hot bath in England and go out

00:02:27.758 --> 00:02:32.352
immediately you will get cancer of the lungs.

00:02:35.672 --> 00:02:39.318
Hot and cold is a very important thing one has to know.

00:02:39.438 --> 00:02:43.146
Like also you can see on the hands you feel hot and cold.

00:02:43.266 --> 00:02:46.789
So now supposing you have taken the coffee,

00:02:47.469 --> 00:02:51.219
after that you cannot take anything cold.

00:02:53.141 --> 00:02:55.318
Is a simple thing one should understand.

00:02:55.438 --> 00:02:58.060
First you can take anything cold.

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.982
Like I have seen people take coffee and then ice cream!

00:03:01.102 --> 00:03:05.028
I mean, [it’s] sure you get troubles! Absolutely sure.

00:03:05.148 --> 00:03:07.896
But if you are taking ice cream, first take ice cream,

00:03:08.016 --> 00:03:11.224
then take a biscuit and then take some water,

00:03:11.344 --> 00:03:16.180
then take some biscuit and then you can take something hot.

00:03:16.813 --> 00:03:18.797
Now supposing you have taken something hot

00:03:18.917 --> 00:03:22.844
and you have to take water also. Then take three biscuits.

00:03:26.141 --> 00:03:29.107
Another very great precaution you have to take

00:03:29.227 --> 00:03:31.318
which I have seen nobody takes

00:03:31.438 --> 00:03:35.028
– now it sometimes becomes very hot outside.

00:03:35.148 --> 00:03:38.344
You are sitting down into programmes or something, becomes very hot.

00:03:38.464 --> 00:03:40.799
You are sitting in the sun sometimes

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:43.122
and your head gets very heated up.

00:03:43.242 --> 00:03:45.771
Immediately [if] you go and get cold water,

00:03:45.891 --> 00:03:49.399
definitely you will get sick, no doubt about it.

00:03:50.125 --> 00:03:52.813
That’s the best way to get sick!

00:03:53.308 --> 00:03:55.318
So if you are sitting in the sun,

00:03:55.438 --> 00:03:59.278
immediately you should never, never, never take any water

00:03:59.398 --> 00:04:01.575
till you have eaten something sweet.

00:04:01.695 --> 00:04:04.318
Take some sugar, or take some jaggery,

00:04:04.438 --> 00:04:07.172
or some biscuit or something.

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:11.031
Even if you are very thirsty you should not do it.

00:04:12.219 --> 00:04:15.063
Little precautions have to be taken.

00:04:15.184 --> 00:04:17.223
Nothing should happen to Sahaja Yogis.

00:04:17.344 --> 00:04:21.570
Because if you get sick, I get sick. That’s the problem is.

00:04:22.164 --> 00:04:24.685
And that’s why I was so sick yesterday.

00:04:24.805 --> 00:04:27.068
I knew that you must be all very sick

00:04:27.188 --> 00:04:29.388
that’s why it has happened to me.
