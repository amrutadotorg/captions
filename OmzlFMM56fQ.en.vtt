05:30.663 --> 05:38.273
I hope your journey has been comfortable so
far and will be comfortable later on, as the

05:38.273 --> 05:40.793
source of comfort is your Spirit.

05:40.793 --> 05:48.053
And more you see to the comfort of your Spirit
the problems of outside comforts drop off.

05:48.053 --> 05:54.303
You are not bothered as to where you live,
where you sleep, what you eat, what you do.

05:54.303 --> 06:02.922
So allow these gross sensitivities to drop
down so that the inner, subtler sensitivities

06:02.922 --> 06:03.922
grow.

06:03.922 --> 06:11.042
That’s why you are here, to get over your
time, conditionings…l mean it is a rat-race,

06:11.042 --> 06:18.363
and the rat race has to be somehow or other
stopped, once and for all, “without”.

06:18.363 --> 06:23.632
So here we can do it “without”, and once
you start meditating, that “within” can

06:23.632 --> 06:33.203
also be achieved and you can achieve that
peace which all human beings should have,

06:33.203 --> 06:36.873
if we have to save this world from complete
destruction.

06:36.873 --> 06:45.113
As you must have realized that now the Sahaja
Yoga is growing much faster, and is taking

06:45.113 --> 06:47.043
a good speed.

06:47.043 --> 06:56.743
And we all have to keep ourselves equipped
to be able to be part and parcel of this great

06:56.743 --> 07:02.763
evolutionary and revolutionary process which
is going to stir up the whole world.

07:02.763 --> 07:08.633
For that, it is important also to see that
we take ourselves to task and don’t get

07:08.633 --> 07:11.703
into mediocre living and mediocre thinking.

07:11.703 --> 07:17.523
We are people of very great potential.

07:17.523 --> 07:22.352
Not only that, but we are blessed by God’s
Divine Power.

07:22.352 --> 07:28.263
Try to use that power within yourself and
try to be one with it.

07:28.263 --> 07:35.253
A little bit, you have to see that you beat
up your body, beat up your mind, beat up your

07:35.253 --> 07:42.952
ego, and chisel it out so that it is beautifully
made, in such a way that you grow into that

07:42.952 --> 07:47.343
image for which you are made.

07:47.343 --> 07:59.383
Regarding other things, like my tours in your
countries; I think, the greatest good is done

07:59.383 --> 08:06.142
to you when you come to ‘this’ country;
as if you belong to this country and you were

08:06.142 --> 08:08.473
uprooted in some other country.

08:08.473 --> 08:14.743
And, when you come here you prosper so well
! And in that country I try so hard, I work

08:14.743 --> 08:19.923
so hard, do all kinds of things, all the time
I spend with you, I do everything, day and

08:19.923 --> 08:32.294
night, all the time—I find it’s impossible
to achieve much, that I see happening to you

08:32.294 --> 08:33.294
here.

08:33.294 --> 08:41.913
As if here you take absolutely with great
ease the divinity of this place.

08:41.913 --> 08:45.952
And I think this uprootedness has to be given
up.

08:45.952 --> 08:53.213
I think as if you had immigrated into those
countries and now you are back in your own!

08:53.213 --> 08:57.262
You are not found out by immigration laws,
I think !

08:57.262 --> 09:04.763
Now, under these circumstances we should change
our tactics and start to establish our ashrams

09:04.763 --> 09:14.463
here, and our own projects here, so that you
people should come down ‘here’ and achieve

09:14.463 --> 09:15.473
more.

09:15.473 --> 09:17.033
You can earn your living there.

09:17.033 --> 09:22.512
But you should come here and spend some lime
for two or three months ‘continuously’

09:22.512 --> 09:24.653
and establish yourself and grow.

09:24.653 --> 09:28.043
Because I don’t think it can be achieved
there that good.

09:28.043 --> 09:30.193
Because we’ve tried everything.

09:30.193 --> 09:34.943
So this is the ultimate outcome of our trips
all over.

09:34.943 --> 09:44.643
Despite all kinds of hazardous routes and
hazardous life here, we are doing very well.

09:44.643 --> 09:52.403
I must say when I see you I find you are all
very good and you are very much better and

09:52.403 --> 09:53.723
it’s all improved.

09:53.723 --> 10:00.213
‘Like watches, you see, when you have to
make them immuned, you put them under absurd

10:00.213 --> 10:02.023
conditions and they get alright.

10:02.023 --> 10:10.993
Like that, now you are immuned ! They are
put into troughs which are shaken very thoroughly

10:10.993 --> 10:15.703
as yesterday you were shaken in the buses.

10:15.703 --> 10:20.123
Then they are made to pass through water which
is running very fast on them.

10:20.123 --> 10:25.543
And all this we are trying here; and I think
your immunity is growing very fast to outward

10:25.543 --> 10:33.693
things, and you are becoming really solid
eternal time pieces, the way you are created

10:33.693 --> 10:35.953
here, and I’m so very happy to see the development.

10:35.953 --> 10:39.913
-That’s the main point which we have achieved
here.

10:39.913 --> 10:41.103
So the attention should be.

10:41.103 --> 10:43.353
out-away from money; first of all.

10:43.353 --> 10:45.053
That is one of the biggest problems.

10:45.053 --> 10:49.473
Actually nobody can believe that affluent
countries are much more money-minded than

10:49.473 --> 10:51.593
Indians are, ‘though they are so developed.

10:51.593 --> 10:56.233
You see, the developed countries are ‘much
more’ money minded, than the Indians are-its

10:56.233 --> 10:57.373
very surprising!

10:57.373 --> 11:01.443
When you see the way they count their pennies
it is impossible to believe that these are

11:01.443 --> 11:02.443
really developed people.

11:02.443 --> 11:04.563
They are worse than beggars sometimes.

11:04.563 --> 11:08.873
So that is what you should get out of-the
money part.

11:08.873 --> 11:12.313
Money is horrible stuff that people count.

11:12.313 --> 11:18.233
I mean-it is better to count the names of
God than count the money-horrible coins .

11:18.233 --> 11:23.093
Then we have other things like gross attachment
to comfort.

11:23.093 --> 11:26.373
I don’t think it’s a very comfortable
life there.

11:26.373 --> 11:28.913
Because here you can move in the night, anytime.

11:28.913 --> 11:33.093
You won’t meet anybody who will snatch your
purse or snatch your bangles.

11:33.093 --> 11:36.593
You can move about the way you like and nobody’s
going to bother.

11:36.593 --> 11:41.493
You won’t meet 2 or 3 drunkards beating
each other-nothing of the kind.

11:41.493 --> 11:42.493
So it’s a very pure life here.

11:42.493 --> 11:46.293
That’s a very big achievement.

11:46.293 --> 11:51.873
And the comforts that you want you can create
later on, if you want to have them.

11:51.873 --> 11:56.403
At least I personally think that too much
modernisation won’t suit this place.

11:56.403 --> 12:02.143
So you should not give them these useless
ideas which makes your body slaves to your

12:02.143 --> 12:07.333
own comforts and ideas of enslavement.

12:07.333 --> 12:14.433
In any case personal cleanliness is very good
here, but the general cleanliness has to be

12:14.433 --> 12:16.113
taught to these people.

12:16.113 --> 12:22.083
All this giving and taking process will work
out very well, I’m sure.

12:22.083 --> 12:30.554
And the way things are moving within yourself,
I have great hopes that you will really grow

12:30.554 --> 12:38.523
much faster if you come to this country and
stay here for some time, in a settled way,

12:38.523 --> 12:40.933
and then go back to your countries.

12:40.933 --> 12:49.283
That would be much better than to have a visit
to your countries, which I feel sometimes

12:49.283 --> 12:54.793
is just bombarded by negativity.

12:54.793 --> 13:03.482
The other point which I wanted to tell you
is that you must learn to understand that

13:03.482 --> 13:06.153
you have come here to gain something.

13:06.153 --> 13:09.183
Nobody is going to gain anything out of you.

13:09.183 --> 13:10.803
So you have to gain something here.

13:10.803 --> 13:20.333
You are students and so you have to learn
something, and try to develop a sense of discipline.

13:20.333 --> 13:24.813
Like a disciple who receives all that is around-“What’s
that?

13:24.813 --> 13:25.913
How is it?

13:25.913 --> 13:28.933
This is the house, that’s nice”, you see,
like that.

13:28.933 --> 13:35.533
But if you go on seeing the thing which is
of no importance and loose talking about things

13:35.533 --> 13:37.363
that do not matter with you.

13:37.363 --> 13:39.073
All these have to be given up.

13:39.073 --> 13:45.992
Because you have so much time there that people
sit down and jabber; talk, loose talks, ugly

13:45.992 --> 13:47.663
talks, useless talks.

13:47.663 --> 13:49.982
That’s not needed at all.

13:49.982 --> 13:56.363
On the contrary it’s better to be quiet,
and assimilate more within yourself.

13:56.363 --> 14:00.763
Because here the people don’t have time,
so they can’t talk, they have to work.

14:00.763 --> 14:05.673
But while you have lime thereto talk, also
here, so we start like that; and that’s

14:05.673 --> 14:07.153
a ‘very’ wrong thing.

14:07.153 --> 14:11.673
Another talking is done with yourself also,
quite a lot.

14:11.673 --> 14:17.743
like you start analysing, criticising and
finding faults and all the time thinking “Oh,

14:17.743 --> 14:22.403
this could have been better-I’ve harmed
very much here…that has happened”, all

14:22.403 --> 14:24.803
those things come into your heads.

14:24.803 --> 14:30.913
So this kind of a inner talk also should be
stopped; they are called as “murmuring souls”

14:30.913 --> 14:34.093
by Christ, who said “Beware of murmuring
souls”.

14:34.093 --> 14:37.053
But these murmuring souls exist within us.

14:37.053 --> 14:42.543
So beware of them and don’t listen to all
nonsensical talks, and try to keep a good

14:42.543 --> 14:49.043
eye on that and be alert, so it will help
you.

14:49.043 --> 14:55.193
On the whole, I must say that this trip and
the last trip, I am overjoyed and I am ,very’

14:55.193 --> 15:03.333
happy that it has brought forth ‘so many’
possibilities before me and your potential.

15:03.333 --> 15:13.013
I am very happy about it, that somehow, in
this year, we have achieved a new type of

15:13.013 --> 15:23.073
atmosphere among all of you, which is humble,
which is quiet, which is peaceful, which is

15:23.073 --> 15:32.583
absorbing the Divine, which is a very, very
great, joyous thing for me.

15:32.583 --> 15:34.713
So I thank you very much for all that.

15:34.713 --> 15:39.073
I hope you keep up your progress this way.
