1
00:00:07,153 --> 00:00:11,457
There’s one God, God Almighty,

2
00:00:11,691 --> 00:00:20,041
but He has His own powers which He can embody into someone

3
00:00:20,241 --> 00:00:27,351
and can get His own manifestation expressed.

4
00:00:27,711 --> 00:00:35,541
So, first of all, He did was to create

5
00:00:35,741 --> 00:00:39,311
the power of Adi Shakti.

6
00:00:39,521 --> 00:00:45,851
When It was created then there was a sound,

7
00:00:46,051 --> 00:00:49,911
the sound that we call as Aum, logos or anything you call it,

8
00:00:50,111 --> 00:00:52,331
by the primordial sound,

9
00:00:52,531 --> 00:00:56,591
and these three powers came out of that sound -

10
00:00:56,791 --> 00:01:02,311
is A, U and M -Aum.

11
00:01:02,701 --> 00:01:07,131
The Adi Shakti is the One

12
00:01:07,331 --> 00:01:12,934
Who embodies the desire of God Almighty.

13
00:01:16,321 --> 00:01:24,626
This power of His love spreads around Him, accumulates and forms another entity called as the Holy Ghost

14
00:01:24,706 --> 00:01:30,981
or you can say the Parashakti or you can call it also as the Primordial Mother.

15
00:01:31,061 --> 00:01:42,907
She is the Holy Ghost. Now, when the break takes place there is a sound and this sound is the logos as you call it,

16
00:01:42,987 --> 00:01:48,802
the Spirit that is that sound which is the divine integrated sound, not one sound,

17
00:01:48,882 --> 00:01:56,906
and that one is called as the Omkara which is the child, the child of this couple

18
00:02:00,764 --> 00:02:03,084
Like that there were many incidents in My life

19
00:02:03,285 --> 00:02:08,196
because I am of a Christian family – protestants –

20
00:02:08,397 --> 00:02:11,857
and when I was born My mother didn’t feel any labor pains or anything

21
00:02:12,058 --> 00:02:14,530
and just I was born; she didn’t know how.

22
00:02:14,802 --> 00:02:19,097
And I had no blood on My body, nothing, I was clean washed.

23
00:02:19,298 --> 00:02:22,610
That’s why they called My name as Nirmala.

24
00:02:23,618 --> 00:02:28,435
But My grandmother said that She should be called as Nishkalanka,

25
00:02:28,654 --> 00:02:30,937
that means the one which has no spots on it.

26
00:02:31,138 --> 00:02:33,234
But that’s the name of man.

27
00:02:33,315 --> 00:02:37,764
So they said, “All right, we'll call Her Nirmala meaning the same, Immaculata.”

28
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:45,900
My name Myself is Nirmala. Means that. Is the same.

29
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:49,775
Means Nishkalanka. Actually, when I was born,

30
00:02:49,855 --> 00:02:54,921
I didn't have a spot on My body. No blood, nothing. Without the navel cord or anything.

31
00:02:55,001 --> 00:03:01,546
So My grandmother, My father’s aunty, she called Me Nishkalanka. She said, is the Nishkalanka is born.

32
00:03:04,357 --> 00:03:09,680
That’s also my name, Leela is, one of my names.

33
00:03:09,761 --> 00:03:14,193
Actually my baptised name is that:

34
00:03:14,286 --> 00:03:20,570
Leela, Lalita, Nirmala, Daisy, four names. By Lutheran church, by Lutheran church.

35
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:29,919
But when you get to your Sahasrara, joy is called Nirananda.

36
00:03:29,999 --> 00:03:33,973
Now Nira is my name, you know that. Ananda means joy.

37
00:03:34,053 --> 00:03:37,967
Nira means: where there is nothing else but joy.

38
00:03:38,047 --> 00:03:40,973
There is complete joy, no reaction, nothing.

39
00:03:41,053 --> 00:03:43,872
Just submerged in joy.

40
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:49,415
But when the Kundalini comes into the Sahasrara,

41
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:56,164
then the joy you receive is called as Nirananda, Nirananda.

42
00:03:56,245 --> 00:04:03,093
Now, Nee means nothing else but Ananda. Nirananda.

43
00:04:05,431 --> 00:04:12,389
Also, is surprising, my name is Nira – also, in my family I’m called as Nira.

44
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:16,776
And Nira also means Mary, Maria.

45
00:04:16,876 --> 00:04:22,971
Because it means marine. Nira is water. Nira means water in Sanskrit language.

46
00:04:23,051 --> 00:04:26,481
It is called as Nirananda in the brain.

47
00:04:30,248 --> 00:04:36,365
I’m illusive, is true. My name is Mahamaya. I am illusive, no doubt.

48
00:04:36,446 --> 00:04:44,662
But I’m illusive just to judge you.

49
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:55,491
Now the dedication is a very important part of the ascent.

50
00:04:55,572 --> 00:04:57,471
Why?

51
00:05:01,059 --> 00:05:13,631
Because when you are precariously placed, when there is immediate danger to your existence;

52
00:05:13,712 --> 00:05:22,635
at this time, when the whole world is standing at a precarious position

53
00:05:22,715 --> 00:05:28,234
where it is going to be destroyed completely,

54
00:05:29,533 --> 00:05:35,328
it’s very important that you cling on to thing that is going to save you

55
00:05:35,408 --> 00:05:40,695
with complete might and complete faith.

56
00:05:42,255 --> 00:05:47,455
Like you are getting drenched in ordinary water, doesn’t matter.

57
00:05:47,561 --> 00:05:50,628
But if you are sinking in the sea,

58
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:56,656
and there’s a question of this moment of existence and that moment of destruction,

59
00:05:56,736 --> 00:06:03,425
that time, if a hand comes forward to fetch you out,

60
00:06:03,505 --> 00:06:06,426
there’s no time for you to think anymore

61
00:06:06,506 --> 00:06:14,555
but cling on to it, with all your might, with all your faith.

62
00:06:15,574 --> 00:06:18,524
Cling on to it.

63
00:06:19,751 --> 00:06:25,639
The Parabrahma has come to look after you.

64
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:27,732
Cling on to it.

65
00:06:27,813 --> 00:06:32,123
Even the death has to go back.

66
00:06:32,204 --> 00:06:36,908
Then what about these minor things?

67
00:06:39,696 --> 00:06:54,553
Now the name of your Mother is very powerful.

68
00:06:57,672 --> 00:07:07,571
You know that is the most powerful Name than all other names, the most powerful mantra.

69
00:07:07,651 --> 00:07:11,281
But you must know how to take it.

70
00:07:11,976 --> 00:07:17,633
With that complete dedication you have to take that Name.

71
00:07:17,713 --> 00:07:21,043
Not like any other name.

72
00:07:23,546 --> 00:07:26,784
You know that in India when take the name of Guru, they pull their ears

73
00:07:26,864 --> 00:07:29,171
for taking the name of the Guru.

74
00:07:29,251 --> 00:07:36,377
Means, “While taking the Name if I am making any mistakes, please forgive me” - means that.

75
00:07:37,877 --> 00:07:44,937
This mantra is a very powerful mantra.

76
00:07:45,018 --> 00:07:53,323
Only what you need is the dedication, the dynamite of dedication.

77
00:07:57,150 --> 00:08:04,910
Don't think about what is happening, how the people are stupid, immoral, forget it.

78
00:08:05,165 --> 00:08:07,975
What you have to know what you are.

79
00:08:08,156 --> 00:08:15,971
You have to be aware of yourself and of your responsibility as being the purest of pure.

80
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:20,774
As my name is indicates, you are My children,

81
00:08:20,848 --> 00:08:26,665
and that indicates the children of Nirmal, means purity.

82
00:08:26,911 --> 00:08:32,671
Purity is the basis of your existence.

83
00:08:36,543 --> 00:08:41,312
On the day of Shakti if you dance you will get that power within yourself.

84
00:08:41,393 --> 00:08:45,481
And that's why you are looking much better now.

85
00:08:47,283 --> 00:08:51,874
In My name if you dance you get the power, no doubt about it.

86
00:08:51,955 --> 00:08:57,414
And that's why here you have to achieve your Spiritual power,

87
00:08:57,495 --> 00:09:03,332
your Spiritual peace and your Spiritual love.

88
00:09:03,413 --> 00:09:06,871
All these things if you can achieve in India

89
00:09:06,952 --> 00:09:12,357
you have done full justice to Me and to yourself.

90
00:09:12,438 --> 00:09:17,190
It is not just a picnic or an outing, nothing of the kind,

91
00:09:17,271 --> 00:09:23,021
and working out internally all of you, now I am sure it will work out.

92
00:09:27,555 --> 00:09:33,050
Now raise your right hand on your heart.

93
00:09:33,891 --> 00:09:41,690
Here you have to "Thank God that you have felt the ocean of joy

94
00:09:41,771 --> 00:09:47,571
and you have felt the ocean of forgiveness

95
00:09:47,817 --> 00:09:52,495
and the capacity to forgive as our Mother has

96
00:09:52,576 --> 00:09:55,976
which we have seen is so tremendous.

97
00:09:56,063 --> 00:10:05,343
Let my heart expand and encompass the whole universe.

98
00:10:05,603 --> 00:10:13,869
And my love should resound the name of God."

99
00:10:13,957 --> 00:10:23,277
The heart, every moment, should express the beauty of God's love.
