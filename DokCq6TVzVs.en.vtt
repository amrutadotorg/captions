WEBVTT

03:29.434 --> 03:32.500
May God bless you all.

03:32.532 --> 03:36.346
And all the blessings of Lakshmi,
all the Ashta Lakshmis upon you.

03:36.371 --> 03:38.852
May God bless you.

04:57.546 --> 05:01.150
I want to see all of them.

05:04.790 --> 05:10.699
In the night I need it,
not in the day time.

05:45.386 --> 05:54.794
Today we have come here to celebrate
a great festival of Deepavali,

05:54.819 --> 06:02.607
meaning the rows of lights,
or the festival of lights.

06:02.632 --> 06:05.734
Somebody has to translate.

06:20.642 --> 06:27.913
It was to celebrate the coronation
of Shri Rama also,

06:33.661 --> 06:40.907
that is to say symbolically to celebrate
the establishment of a kingdom

06:40.932 --> 06:46.657
which has a benevolent
administration.

06:58.711 --> 07:06.342
Today I find all of you here
as the lights sitting before Me.

07:10.151 --> 07:16.267
And with these lights I feel
the Deepawali really celebrated,

07:16.292 --> 07:21.462
I see the twingling of those eyes,
twinkling in the eye

07:21.487 --> 07:25.697
of that light which is within you.

07:36.212 --> 07:44.946
In the lamp of light we have to put
something that is soft, like ghee,

07:44.971 --> 07:52.996
that’s something very mild and soft,
is the love of our heart.

08:05.917 --> 08:14.976
And that burns to give this soothing
light of love to others.

08:22.850 --> 08:28.319
Such a person who has this light
of love, loves himself as well,

08:28.344 --> 08:32.519
and emits love for others.

08:41.743 --> 08:47.681
I’ve been hearing about the way people
used to torture themselves

08:47.706 --> 08:50.423
to become saintly.

08:58.029 --> 09:04.598
There’s no need at all for sahaja yogis
- at all - to torture themselves.

09:08.973 --> 09:16.846
But to be the light of a higher
magnitude,

09:16.871 --> 09:22.984
they have to be full of love.

09:30.815 --> 09:35.863
And this love they get it
from where?

09:38.450 --> 09:41.903
You may say it is from Me,

09:43.343 --> 09:49.338
is true, but the sap of the tree
flows all over,

09:54.705 --> 09:58.756
and all the tree must live
together.

10:00.585 --> 10:06.010
Any leaf that wants to separate itself
will die out.

10:09.527 --> 10:15.393
So is the collectivity which is going
to make you grow.

10:17.648 --> 10:23.864
Any ideas which you have of keeping
yourself out,

10:23.889 --> 10:31.964
or preserving yourself out, or having
your houses separate

10:31.989 --> 10:36.767
from the collectivity, may be
dangerous.

10:50.703 --> 10:58.209
The houses may be separate, but they must
be the houses of all the sahaja yogis.

11:03.394 --> 11:07.919
Anybody who comes to your house,
who is a sahaja yogi,

11:07.944 --> 11:12.482
is owner of that house.

11:20.797 --> 11:25.103
That sort of a feeling should be
developed,

11:29.252 --> 11:34.703
when the light you take out from
one room to another room,

11:34.735 --> 11:38.111
it does not say: “This is my room
so I give light,

11:38.136 --> 11:41.645
if I go to another room I will not
give light.”

11:51.828 --> 11:56.611
Now, light is absolutely detached.

11:59.476 --> 12:04.739
If you do not look after your light,
it will extinguish.

12:09.602 --> 12:14.966
You have to look after it till it takes
its proper stand.

12:21.047 --> 12:23.854
And once it takes a particular
stand,

12:23.879 --> 12:29.200
then you are a strong sahaja
yogi.

12:37.129 --> 12:40.934
Then they see the light
on your face.

12:42.817 --> 12:47.086
And then you manifest light
in their lives.

12:50.442 --> 12:54.792
This light, if you put finger on it,
it will burn.

12:59.498 --> 13:04.002
But the light of love never
burns.

13:05.896 --> 13:09.313
It dissolves all that is bad.

13:12.790 --> 13:18.195
It rejects, it turns away from whatever
that is wrong.

13:23.571 --> 13:26.096
It has patience

13:27.644 --> 13:32.401
and it expels the darkness.

13:39.534 --> 13:42.970
Darkness within and without.

13:46.299 --> 13:50.995
Diwali day is specially meant
to celebrate with the lights,

13:51.020 --> 13:54.951
on a day when Lakshmi
was born.

14:03.415 --> 14:09.438
Now this Lakshmi came out
of the sea,

14:12.853 --> 14:19.549
and even today there’s lot of Lakshmi
lying under the beds of the sea.

14:29.650 --> 14:36.225
But when you do not understand
the real significance of Lakshmi,

14:40.329 --> 14:43.349
then it brings darkness

14:44.883 --> 14:47.843
and Lakshmi disappears.

14:48.818 --> 14:53.215
For example, somebody gets
lots of money:

14:55.720 --> 15:01.501
immediately he will have his first-class
bar in the house.

15:07.029 --> 15:11.399
Then he’ll have his friends to come
and have drinks.

15:14.354 --> 15:17.174
He’ll drink with them

15:17.199 --> 15:21.829
and suddenly find that Lakshmi
has disappeared.

15:27.743 --> 15:33.146
So wherever there is wine,
there is darkness.

15:36.811 --> 15:45.038
And that darkness which comes to you
with the Lakshmi,

15:45.063 --> 15:49.345
makes Lakshmi just disappear.

15:55.389 --> 16:00.043
The whole of the universe, the whole
cosmos is so well-knit

16:00.075 --> 16:06.640
that if you try to do one thing wrong
this side, everything goes off.

16:15.696 --> 16:23.247
It is so well connected, like one bulb
fuses everything fuses off.

16:33.459 --> 16:38.320
In Sahaja Yoga also, it happens
like this,

16:38.345 --> 16:44.746
that a person who is enlightened,
and tries to be nasty,

16:44.771 --> 16:50.239
tries to create problems, can make
others negative.

17:05.457 --> 17:09.950
In the beginning it used to happen
very often,

17:12.026 --> 17:17.620
like one bad apple can spoil
all the good apples.

17:21.831 --> 17:28.813
But one bad apple cannot be corrected
by all the good apples.

17:34.464 --> 17:38.777
One Hitler could make many
Hitlers,

17:41.289 --> 17:46.198
but in Sahaja Yoga when you are
grown up and established,

17:46.223 --> 17:53.987
then one bad man if comes, either he has
to run away or he has to get well.

18:08.559 --> 18:14.447
A person like that himself he tie up
all his luggage and go away.

18:21.432 --> 18:29.189
But the main people, the people
who are grown up

18:29.214 --> 18:35.988
and who are matured, should keep
their maturity and assert it.

18:45.308 --> 18:48.929
It’s in the form of light, again.

18:50.797 --> 18:56.322
Now, if there are many lights
like these are,

18:56.347 --> 19:00.939
and one of them goes out, doesn’t
matter, because it’s,

19:00.964 --> 19:04.324
there are so many others
like that.

19:12.451 --> 19:16.549
But if there is one light which is
matured enough,

19:16.574 --> 19:20.786
even all of them go away,
doesn’t matter.

19:29.195 --> 19:37.428
So the people who are half sahaja
yogis, or quarter sahaja yogis

19:42.627 --> 19:48.717
have to understand that they play
no important role in Sahaja Yoga.

19:57.908 --> 20:03.560
Everybody has to become a full-fledged
sahaja yogi.

20:08.838 --> 20:12.165
Then it matters a lot

20:13.971 --> 20:19.062
if a such sahaja yogi is sick,
or is in problem,

20:19.087 --> 20:25.043
all the angels would run to help
them.

20:34.412 --> 20:38.002
So today is a special day
to celebrate

20:38.027 --> 20:44.213
the kingdom of God on earth.

20:49.529 --> 20:55.479
As we used to pray: “Thy Kingdom
come, on this earth.”

20:59.018 --> 21:03.595
And it has come today on this
mountain.

21:06.564 --> 21:12.598
And we are here to celebrate
the coming

21:12.920 --> 21:23.932
of the kingdom of God, as we have
been praying for ages!

21:33.263 --> 21:42.910
And the blessings of kingdom of God is
that you get drenched in joy.

21:47.913 --> 21:52.813
Joy which has no duality, like
happiness and unhappiness.

21:55.999 --> 22:01.525
Is an experience of absoluteness.

22:02.556 --> 22:07.354
And just that joy is sufficient,
you don’t want any food,

22:07.379 --> 22:11.632
you don’t want to sleep, you don’t mind
where you are,

22:11.657 --> 22:15.483
just in joy drenched completely.

22:27.089 --> 22:30.750
There’s no place for unhappiness,

22:31.548 --> 22:34.501
we have no heart for it.

22:36.837 --> 22:40.676
Italians were known to be
melancholic people,

22:44.791 --> 22:50.012
but now I find all of them are so joyous
that nobody can believe

22:50.037 --> 22:54.194
that they could have been melancholic
once upon a time.

23:00.672 --> 23:04.748
Not only that, but they are giving
so much joy.

23:06.992 --> 23:11.968
The program should open our eyes
of all the Europeans to see

23:11.993 --> 23:15.689
how on the stage they were singing
songs to Me,

23:15.714 --> 23:21.409
and everybody in the audience
was clapping and enjoying it.

23:33.893 --> 23:37.688
Because Italians are very humble
people.

23:39.696 --> 23:43.489
And it is the humble who will be
entering into the kingdom of God,

23:43.514 --> 23:46.213
and not the arrogant.

23:50.734 --> 23:55.603
They’ll have to go to hell to get rid
of their arrogance.

23:59.282 --> 24:04.069
This is something is very great that
we are celebrating Diwali here,

24:04.094 --> 24:08.003
that in the place where people
are humble,

24:12.918 --> 24:17.355
and they have the right to be
joyous.

24:19.423 --> 24:23.365
They have the right on their
Mother,

24:26.292 --> 24:30.871
they have the right to ask for anything
that they want.

24:33.438 --> 24:37.056
This is what is surrendering.

24:38.962 --> 24:43.601
Humble person means the person
who doesn’t have ego.

24:46.317 --> 24:51.425
So to burn off ego, and to burn off
our conditioning,

24:51.450 --> 24:55.342
we had this festival called Holi.

25:04.139 --> 25:08.415
But now we have a new festival,
which is a festival

25:08.440 --> 25:12.080
of singing songs of joy,

25:18.090 --> 25:21.145
and joy alone.

25:22.496 --> 25:26.665
In this Diwali day, let us wish

25:26.690 --> 25:32.693
that so many people fall into
this ocean of joy,

25:42.279 --> 25:51.971
and the ocean of joy has to expand
its borders, shores.

25:56.464 --> 25:59.682
A sea never does that,

26:01.554 --> 26:08.505
but sahaja yogis can do it because
they have ocean of love in their hearts.

26:13.484 --> 26:19.092
So I wish you all a very happy Diwali,
in the sense

26:19.117 --> 26:23.807
that you will enlighten more lights,
every sahaja yogi

26:23.847 --> 26:30.138
should enlighten at least hundred
lights in this year.

26:43.164 --> 26:49.727
Every person you meet, you can talk
to them about Sahaja Yoga.

26:52.587 --> 26:58.142
Not about Me. Later on,
gradually.

27:02.838 --> 27:08.233
So I hope you’ll enjoy your Diwali here,
all of you,

27:08.258 --> 27:14.372
and we’ll create an ocean which
will expand, grow,

27:14.397 --> 27:20.541
and engulf more and more people
into this joyous company.

27:29.451 --> 27:33.171
Today, I don’t want to say that
I’m sorry because I came late,

27:33.204 --> 27:37.503
which won’t be good on a joyous
day like this.

27:42.877 --> 27:46.500
But waiting has so dividends
to play, pay

27:46.525 --> 27:54.517
– waiting gives you another kind
of appreciation of meeting.

28:05.416 --> 28:08.811
May God bless you all.

28:13.659 --> 28:17.682
So we should continue with music…
