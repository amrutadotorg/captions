00:03:29.434 --> 00:03:32.500
May God bless you all.

00:03:32.532 --> 00:03:36.346
And all the blessings of Lakshmi,
all the Ashta Lakshmis upon you.

00:03:36.371 --> 00:03:38.852
May God bless you.

00:04:57.546 --> 00:05:01.150
I want to see all of them.

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:10.699
In the night I need it,
not in the day time.

00:05:45.386 --> 00:05:54.794
Today we have come here to celebrate
a great festival of Deepavali,

00:05:54.819 --> 00:06:02.607
meaning the rows of lights,
or the festival of lights.

00:06:02.632 --> 00:06:05.734
Somebody has to translate.

00:06:20.642 --> 00:06:27.913
It was to celebrate the coronation
of Shri Rama also,

00:06:33.661 --> 00:06:40.907
that is to say symbolically to celebrate
the establishment of a kingdom

00:06:40.932 --> 00:06:46.657
which has a benevolent
administration.

00:06:58.711 --> 00:07:06.342
Today I find all of you here
as the lights sitting before Me.

00:07:10.151 --> 00:07:16.267
And with these lights I feel
the Deepawali really celebrated,

00:07:16.292 --> 00:07:21.462
I see the twingling of those eyes,
twinkling in the eye

00:07:21.487 --> 00:07:25.697
of that light which is within you.

00:07:36.212 --> 00:07:44.946
In the lamp of light we have to put
something that is soft, like ghee,

00:07:44.971 --> 00:07:52.996
that’s something very mild and soft,
is the love of our heart.

00:08:05.917 --> 00:08:14.976
And that burns to give this soothing
light of love to others.

00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:28.319
Such a person who has this light
of love, loves himself as well,

00:08:28.344 --> 00:08:32.519
and emits love for others.

00:08:41.743 --> 00:08:47.681
I’ve been hearing about the way people
used to torture themselves

00:08:47.706 --> 00:08:50.423
to become saintly.

00:08:58.029 --> 00:09:04.598
There’s no need at all for sahaja yogis
- at all - to torture themselves.

00:09:08.973 --> 00:09:16.846
But to be the light of a higher
magnitude,

00:09:16.871 --> 00:09:22.984
they have to be full of love.

00:09:30.815 --> 00:09:35.863
And this love they get it
from where?

00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:41.903
You may say it is from Me,

00:09:43.343 --> 00:09:49.338
is true, but the sap of the tree
flows all over,

00:09:54.705 --> 00:09:58.756
and all the tree must live
together.

00:10:00.585 --> 00:10:06.010
Any leaf that wants to separate itself
will die out.

00:10:09.527 --> 00:10:15.393
So is the collectivity which is going
to make you grow.

00:10:17.648 --> 00:10:23.864
Any ideas which you have of keeping
yourself out,

00:10:23.889 --> 00:10:31.964
or preserving yourself out, or having
your houses separate

00:10:31.989 --> 00:10:36.767
from the collectivity, may be
dangerous.

00:10:50.703 --> 00:10:58.209
The houses may be separate, but they must
be the houses of all the sahaja yogis.

00:11:03.394 --> 00:11:07.919
Anybody who comes to your house,
who is a sahaja yogi,

00:11:07.944 --> 00:11:12.482
is owner of that house.

00:11:20.797 --> 00:11:25.103
That sort of a feeling should be
developed,

00:11:29.252 --> 00:11:34.703
when the light you take out from
one room to another room,

00:11:34.735 --> 00:11:38.111
it does not say: “This is my room
so I give light,

00:11:38.136 --> 00:11:41.645
if I go to another room I will not
give light.”

00:11:51.828 --> 00:11:56.611
Now, light is absolutely detached.

00:11:59.476 --> 00:12:04.739
If you do not look after your light,
it will extinguish.

00:12:09.602 --> 00:12:14.966
You have to look after it till it takes
its proper stand.

00:12:21.047 --> 00:12:23.854
And once it takes a particular
stand,

00:12:23.879 --> 00:12:29.200
then you are a strong sahaja
yogi.

00:12:37.129 --> 00:12:40.934
Then they see the light
on your face.

00:12:42.817 --> 00:12:47.086
And then you manifest light
in their lives.

00:12:50.442 --> 00:12:54.792
This light, if you put finger on it,
it will burn.

00:12:59.498 --> 00:13:04.002
But the light of love never
burns.

00:13:05.896 --> 00:13:09.313
It dissolves all that is bad.

00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:18.195
It rejects, it turns away from whatever
that is wrong.

00:13:23.571 --> 00:13:26.096
It has patience

00:13:27.644 --> 00:13:32.401
and it expels the darkness.

00:13:39.534 --> 00:13:42.970
Darkness within and without.

00:13:46.299 --> 00:13:50.995
Diwali day is specially meant
to celebrate with the lights,

00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:54.951
on a day when Lakshmi
was born.

00:14:03.415 --> 00:14:09.438
Now this Lakshmi came out
of the sea,

00:14:12.853 --> 00:14:19.549
and even today there’s lot of Lakshmi
lying under the beds of the sea.

00:14:29.650 --> 00:14:36.225
But when you do not understand
the real significance of Lakshmi,

00:14:40.329 --> 00:14:43.349
then it brings darkness

00:14:44.883 --> 00:14:47.843
and Lakshmi disappears.

00:14:48.818 --> 00:14:53.215
For example, somebody gets
lots of money:

00:14:55.720 --> 00:15:01.501
immediately he will have his first-class
bar in the house.

00:15:07.029 --> 00:15:11.399
Then he’ll have his friends to come
and have drinks.

00:15:14.354 --> 00:15:17.174
He’ll drink with them

00:15:17.199 --> 00:15:21.829
and suddenly find that Lakshmi
has disappeared.

00:15:27.743 --> 00:15:33.146
So wherever there is wine,
there is darkness.

00:15:36.811 --> 00:15:45.038
And that darkness which comes to you
with the Lakshmi,

00:15:45.063 --> 00:15:49.345
makes Lakshmi just disappear.

00:15:55.389 --> 00:16:00.043
The whole of the universe, the whole
cosmos is so well-knit

00:16:00.075 --> 00:16:06.640
that if you try to do one thing wrong
this side, everything goes off.

00:16:15.696 --> 00:16:23.247
It is so well connected, like one bulb
fuses everything fuses off.

00:16:33.459 --> 00:16:38.320
In Sahaja Yoga also, it happens
like this,

00:16:38.345 --> 00:16:44.746
that a person who is enlightened,
and tries to be nasty,

00:16:44.771 --> 00:16:50.239
tries to create problems, can make
others negative.

00:17:05.457 --> 00:17:09.950
In the beginning it used to happen
very often,

00:17:12.026 --> 00:17:17.620
like one bad apple can spoil
all the good apples.

00:17:21.831 --> 00:17:28.813
But one bad apple cannot be corrected
by all the good apples.

00:17:34.464 --> 00:17:38.777
One Hitler could make many
Hitlers,

00:17:41.289 --> 00:17:46.198
but in Sahaja Yoga when you are
grown up and established,

00:17:46.223 --> 00:17:53.987
then one bad man if comes, either he has
to run away or he has to get well.

00:18:08.559 --> 00:18:14.447
A person like that himself he tie up
all his luggage and go away.

00:18:21.432 --> 00:18:29.189
But the main people, the people
who are grown up

00:18:29.214 --> 00:18:35.988
and who are matured, should keep
their maturity and assert it.

00:18:45.308 --> 00:18:48.929
It’s in the form of light, again.

00:18:50.797 --> 00:18:56.322
Now, if there are many lights
like these are,

00:18:56.347 --> 00:19:00.939
and one of them goes out, doesn’t
matter, because it’s,

00:19:00.964 --> 00:19:04.324
there are so many others
like that.

00:19:12.451 --> 00:19:16.549
But if there is one light which is
matured enough,

00:19:16.574 --> 00:19:20.786
even all of them go away,
doesn’t matter.

00:19:29.195 --> 00:19:37.428
So the people who are half sahaja
yogis, or quarter sahaja yogis

00:19:42.627 --> 00:19:48.717
have to understand that they play
no important role in Sahaja Yoga.

00:19:57.908 --> 00:20:03.560
Everybody has to become a full-fledged
sahaja yogi.

00:20:08.838 --> 00:20:12.165
Then it matters a lot

00:20:13.971 --> 00:20:19.062
if a such sahaja yogi is sick,
or is in problem,

00:20:19.087 --> 00:20:25.043
all the angels would run to help
them.

00:20:34.412 --> 00:20:38.002
So today is a special day
to celebrate

00:20:38.027 --> 00:20:44.213
the kingdom of God on earth.

00:20:49.529 --> 00:20:55.479
As we used to pray: “Thy Kingdom
come, on this earth.”

00:20:59.018 --> 00:21:03.595
And it has come today on this
mountain.

00:21:06.564 --> 00:21:12.598
And we are here to celebrate
the coming

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:23.932
of the kingdom of God, as we have
been praying for ages!

00:21:33.263 --> 00:21:42.910
And the blessings of kingdom of God is
that you get drenched in joy.

00:21:47.913 --> 00:21:52.813
Joy which has no duality, like
happiness and unhappiness.

00:21:55.999 --> 00:22:01.525
Is an experience of absoluteness.

00:22:02.556 --> 00:22:07.354
And just that joy is sufficient,
you don’t want any food,

00:22:07.379 --> 00:22:11.632
you don’t want to sleep, you don’t mind
where you are,

00:22:11.657 --> 00:22:15.483
just in joy drenched completely.

00:22:27.089 --> 00:22:30.750
There’s no place for unhappiness,

00:22:31.548 --> 00:22:34.501
we have no heart for it.

00:22:36.837 --> 00:22:40.676
Italians were known to be
melancholic people,

00:22:44.791 --> 00:22:50.012
but now I find all of them are so joyous
that nobody can believe

00:22:50.037 --> 00:22:54.194
that they could have been melancholic
once upon a time.

00:23:00.672 --> 00:23:04.748
Not only that, but they are giving
so much joy.

00:23:06.992 --> 00:23:11.968
The program should open our eyes
of all the Europeans to see

00:23:11.993 --> 00:23:15.689
how on the stage they were singing
songs to Me,

00:23:15.714 --> 00:23:21.409
and everybody in the audience
was clapping and enjoying it.

00:23:33.893 --> 00:23:37.688
Because Italians are very humble
people.

00:23:39.696 --> 00:23:43.489
And it is the humble who will be
entering into the kingdom of God,

00:23:43.514 --> 00:23:46.213
and not the arrogant.

00:23:50.734 --> 00:23:55.603
They’ll have to go to hell to get rid
of their arrogance.

00:23:59.282 --> 00:24:04.069
This is something is very great that
we are celebrating Diwali here,

00:24:04.094 --> 00:24:08.003
that in the place where people
are humble,

00:24:12.918 --> 00:24:17.355
and they have the right to be
joyous.

00:24:19.423 --> 00:24:23.365
They have the right on their
Mother,

00:24:26.292 --> 00:24:30.871
they have the right to ask for anything
that they want.

00:24:33.438 --> 00:24:37.056
This is what is surrendering.

00:24:38.962 --> 00:24:43.601
Humble person means the person
who doesn’t have ego.

00:24:46.317 --> 00:24:51.425
So to burn off ego, and to burn off
our conditioning,

00:24:51.450 --> 00:24:55.342
we had this festival called Holi.

00:25:04.139 --> 00:25:08.415
But now we have a new festival,
which is a festival

00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:12.080
of singing songs of joy,

00:25:18.090 --> 00:25:21.145
and joy alone.

00:25:22.496 --> 00:25:26.665
In this Diwali day, let us wish

00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:32.693
that so many people fall into
this ocean of joy,

00:25:42.279 --> 00:25:51.971
and the ocean of joy has to expand
its borders, shores.

00:25:56.464 --> 00:25:59.682
A sea never does that,

00:26:01.554 --> 00:26:08.505
but sahaja yogis can do it because
they have ocean of love in their hearts.

00:26:13.484 --> 00:26:19.092
So I wish you all a very happy Diwali,
in the sense

00:26:19.117 --> 00:26:23.807
that you will enlighten more lights,
every sahaja yogi

00:26:23.847 --> 00:26:30.138
should enlighten at least hundred
lights in this year.

00:26:43.164 --> 00:26:49.727
Every person you meet, you can talk
to them about Sahaja Yoga.

00:26:52.587 --> 00:26:58.142
Not about Me. Later on,
gradually.

00:27:02.838 --> 00:27:08.233
So I hope you’ll enjoy your Diwali here,
all of you,

00:27:08.258 --> 00:27:14.372
and we’ll create an ocean which
will expand, grow,

00:27:14.397 --> 00:27:20.541
and engulf more and more people
into this joyous company.

00:27:29.451 --> 00:27:33.171
Today, I don’t want to say that
I’m sorry because I came late,

00:27:33.204 --> 00:27:37.503
which won’t be good on a joyous
day like this.

00:27:42.877 --> 00:27:46.500
But waiting has so dividends
to play, pay

00:27:46.525 --> 00:27:54.517
– waiting gives you another kind
of appreciation of meeting.

00:28:05.416 --> 00:28:08.811
May God bless you all.

00:28:13.659 --> 00:28:17.682
So we should continue with music…
