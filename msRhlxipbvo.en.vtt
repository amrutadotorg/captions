00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:07.470
You don't know how your Mother feels

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:11.870
to see so many people

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.830
who have become really gurus themselves.

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.870
They have been seeking the Truth

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:34.950
in a very difficult times.

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.190
They have been wanting to know what is the Truth.

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.630
And this difficult time, itself, has served

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:54.430
to act upon your minds

00:00:54.990 --> 00:01:00.030
that what is happening in this world,

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:07.790
whatever we are seeing around us,

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.696
in the whole world also,

00:01:13.025 --> 00:01:17.330
there is something definitely very wrong

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:21.630
and we have to go beyond.

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:32.350
In the seeking, one thing is very important,

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.030
that the person should have

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.670
a great devotion about it.

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:52.030
And also untold miseries you have to go through.

00:01:53.950 --> 00:02:02.390
Seeking is when within yourself also you are struggling

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:09.070
and outside also you find nothing satisfactory.

00:02:12.278 --> 00:02:17.518
This is how the seeking has a double edge.

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:28.030
In that seeking, when you are trying

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:34.230
to get to the Truth, it seems it's a very difficult thing.

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:41.590
But you can't help it, because you are not satisfied

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:47.950
with what exists around you.

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:56.310
See the world today, it's full of strife.

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.390
All kinds of strifes are there.

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.310
People are fighting for nothing at all - for land;

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.870
killing human beings.

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:16.590
Land, can it create human beings?

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.910
They are fighting in a very collective manner

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:28.390
thinking they are doing a very great service to humanity.

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.670
The thinking today of human beings

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:39.470
is not at all deep, it is very superficial

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.990
and that's how you find this world full of turmoil;

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:49.310
every day, every minute you can find...

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:54.470
they are killing so many human beings.

00:03:55.070 --> 00:04:00.750
This is they are torturing, in a very large scale:

00:04:01.677 --> 00:04:05.477
Formally, of course, the saints were all tortured

00:04:06.317 --> 00:04:11.797
- tortured by all kinds of

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:17.790
different stupid ideas, I should say,

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:24.230
of something being higher, something being lower;

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:29.590
something being good, something being bad.

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:35.150
Under such ideas

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:38.472
they combine together

00:04:38.637 --> 00:04:44.498
and worked out all kind of aggression all over the world.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:48.108
All over. Not only that,

00:04:48.296 --> 00:04:55.550
but also in the families, in the institutions,

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:58.710
in the organisation,

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:04.390
thinking that they were very right, they were very good,

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:08.350
and they tried to aggress other personalities.

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:16.670
So, many people thought 'It's better to fight it back'

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:21.670
and they started fighting it out collectively

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:24.910
- it doesn't work out.

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:28.590
This fighting doesn't work out,

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:36.590
because fighting begets

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:42.390
nothing but murders, killing.

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:47.070
Thus many people were killed.

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:53.630
Buddha talked to people of non-resistance,

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:57.710
and there is history about it

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:06.110
that in one of the great universities in Bihar,

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:10.950
when the aggressive people came in,

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:21.557
they killed all the saints in the name of aggression.

00:06:23.493 --> 00:06:26.613
And they all died.

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:33.030
Maybe that might have achieved on a very subtler level

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:40.710
some sort of punyas; but in this Kali Yuga,

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:43.950
it is not going to work out.

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:47.870
What is the resistance

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:51.550
you can put in against such people?

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:54.990
How can you fight them?

00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:00.350
It's an impossible situation

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:05.790
to convince anybody that they are aggressive

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:10.110
and they are nowhere near the Truth.

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:16.190
Because nobody wants to accept such a thing.

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:21.950
And so whatever they are trying, all over the world,

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:30.110
to convince others of their follies, are completely failing.

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:40.230
And thus this struggle, this war mongering cannot be cured.

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:51.190
We have to accept that human beings are not at that level

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:56.150
to understand what's wrong with them.

00:07:56.990 --> 00:08:00.190
They do not want to accept.

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:05.910
To them, aggression is the only way

00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:10.430
they can propound their own goodness.

00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:17.590
So what is the solution?

00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:23.910
The solution is that we should give all of them Self Realisation.

00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:30.070
They should get their Self Realisation,

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:33.710
then only things will improve.

00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:36.190
Now, you might say that "Mother

00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:40.790
in those days of strife and struggle and fighting,

00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:47.910
it will work out. Circumstances will tell them.

00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:53.150
Life will be so difficult

00:08:54.070 --> 00:09:00.270
with all the time weapons hanging on their heads,

00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:05.390
that they have to also seek the Truth" .

00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:10.950
It has to be done very genuinely.

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:18.110
If they are seeking the Truth, they will be surprised

00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:25.510
that this world is one, all human beings are one,

00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:29.910
and that is the destiny of human beings.

00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:35.190
But for that, so many are to be killed,

00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:39.070
so many are to be destroyed,

00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:44.070
because they don't learn lesson in an easy way.

00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:56.030
Now your job is to give them Self Realisation,

00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:02.070
and change the people.

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:09.350
That's the real thing you have to do as gurus.

00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:13.830
But what are we doing?

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:19.350
We come to Sahaja Yoga with what idea?

00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:24.510
You are working only on the periphery

00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:29.590
Firstly we are worried about ourselves:

00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:36.790
how we can prosper, how can we become better off;

00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:44.670
also there is greed. We do not see ourselves,

00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:52.270
if we are aggressive, if we are trying to trouble others,

00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:58.870
if we have wrong ideas about ourselves, how we torture others.

00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:06.910
So first of all you have to cleanse yourself and accept

00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:15.390
your own problems, your own misgivings.

00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:24.550
These are to be faced. And challenge yourself.

00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:32.670
What are you doing? You are a Sahaja Yogi,

00:11:33.070 --> 00:11:39.630
how can you hate someone? How can you trouble someone?

00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:42.990
How can you torture someone?

00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:49.510
This is the beginning of introspection, it's very important.

00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:53.630
I can make out a person who meditates,

00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:59.990
in the real sense of the word, and the one who just 'meditates'.

00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:07.670
You should not deceive yourself. If you are deceiving yourself,

00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:15.990
then how can you become a guru?

00:12:19.510 --> 00:12:23.670
For becoming a good guru, you have to first of all

00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:28.750
be very honest within yourself, and find out

00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:33.710
what are you doing, what are you up to, what have you done.

00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:43.790
We have six enemies, as I have told you.

00:12:56.470 --> 00:13:04.390
And we justify all these enemies. We think, "It is all right!

00:13:05.310 --> 00:13:11.030
After all I did this because of this, I had to do it" .

00:13:11.510 --> 00:13:19.510
Somebody would say "I was poor, so I had to be dishonest" .

00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:28.910
Another would say that, "I had to tell lies" .

00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:43.670
Another would say that "I had to be immoral" .

00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:50.110
This is the biggest thing human beings have is justification!

00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:54.790
Animals don't have it. They have their fixed ideas,

00:13:55.270 --> 00:13:58.990
they have their fixed 'nature'.

00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:06.550
But human beings can do all kinds of wrong things and can justify it

00:14:08.270 --> 00:14:14.550
This justification doesn't help you in your ascent.

00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:19.590
"I did this because of that " .

00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:24.590
It never helps you!

00:14:24.950 --> 00:14:31.070
One should try to introspect and see for yourself

00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:34.630
what is the justification.

00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:45.590
So when you start supporting yourself in doing all kinds of

00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:51.350
opposite things, how can you rise?

00:14:53.070 --> 00:15:00.510
How can you ascend? All the time you are trying to descend!

00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:06.390
So purification within is only possible

00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:09.910
if you can see yourself clearly,

00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:17.950
if you can't see how will you purify? If I can't see in the mirror,

00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:21.870
how will I see what's wrong with my face?

00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:26.790
So when you start seeing the Truth,

00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:30.470
and comparing yourself with that,

00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:36.070
then only you can clear out yourself.

00:15:37.390 --> 00:15:43.270
But the identification should be with the Truth.

00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:48.190
For example you see in the mirror your face

00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:51.630
and you find something wrong

00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:55.110
you are not identified with that wrong,

00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:59.190
but you are identified with your own face,

00:15:59.390 --> 00:16:03.950
and so you clear it out, cleanse it out.

00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:09.350
In the same way, if you are identified with your Self

00:16:09.950 --> 00:16:14.270
you cannot get rid of it.

00:16:16.510 --> 00:16:22.550
When you are climbing ahead

00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:29.390
into the new path of righteousness, of goodness,

00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:37.950
of compassion and love, you should see yourself, watch yourself.

00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:44.070
What are you doing? Where are you going?

00:16:44.630 --> 00:16:52.350
How far you are stupid? You should not cheat yourself.

00:16:55.550 --> 00:17:01.110
Let others cheat you, let others do whatever they like.

00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:06.430
Let others try to kill you, but don't you kill yourself!

00:17:07.390 --> 00:17:15.150
You don't cheat yourself! So you have your self-respect,

00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:19.710
and you have your self-honour,

00:17:20.430 --> 00:17:27.430
which you value more than anybody else. And you don't kneel

00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:35.990
to anything that will spoil your image in the mirror.

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:43.070
This is the first step, is of introspection.

00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:55.030
Now what helps for this introspection is your sense of love.

00:17:57.430 --> 00:18:04.550
Can you love a person who is distressful?

00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:11.670
One who is aggressive? One who is hot-tempered?

00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:15.150
One who cheats you?

00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:19.790
Can you love such a person? You cannot,

00:18:20.830 --> 00:18:27.110
Then how can you love yourself when you have these qualities,

00:18:27.550 --> 00:18:31.710
when you do this to yourself?

00:18:40.030 --> 00:18:47.230
So the first thing is the pure love for yourself.

00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:56.110
Pure love. It's such a great thing to have pure love.

00:18:56.550 --> 00:19:03.070
Like, you may like to have a very nice bed to sleep;

00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:09.510
you may like to have a very beautiful house;

00:19:09.910 --> 00:19:14.710
you may like to have all the wealth of the world.

00:19:14.910 --> 00:19:22.910
But, all this, will it make you love yourself?

00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:31.350
If you love yourself, you don't want anything!

00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:38.350
Because you enjoy your Self! To enjoy your Self

00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:41.950
is the greatest enjoyment.

00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:45.590
So now you have got Self Realisation.

00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:49.510
Means you know what you are,

00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:53.430
you know what beautiful thing you are.

00:19:53.990 --> 00:20:00.310
When that is so, you should try to love your self.

00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:04.510
And when you start loving yourself,

00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:08.750
you are not bothered about all non-sensical things.

00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:15.550
Now this pure love is one of the most beautiful things

00:20:15.870 --> 00:20:19.710
you have which you can do to yourself.

00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:28.510
When you are selfish, you are not loving your self.

00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:35.430
When you are unkind, you are not loving your self.

00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:40.070
When you are agressive, you are not loving your self.

00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:47.630
Because you are loving all these bad things; but your Self is pure.

00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:52.590
It's absolutely pure and beautiful.

00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:57.790
And it loves all that is beautiful and good.

00:20:59.070 --> 00:21:03.910
So this is the beginning of your 'Self' Realisation:

00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:08.990
when you realise how important is your Self.

00:21:09.230 --> 00:21:12.790
You don't have wrong ideas about yourself,

00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:16.390
you don't justify all the wrong things you do,

00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:24.590
because you understand that  is a blemish on your Self.

00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:30.670
Face yourself in the most honest manner,

00:21:31.550 --> 00:21:36.110
and you will be amazed to see how nice it is.

00:21:36.510 --> 00:21:42.310
Just to see the pure Self shining within you.

00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:49.430
When that Self starts shining, you start seeing many other things

00:21:49.790 --> 00:21:56.750
which you have not seen, so far. And one of them you see

00:21:57.190 --> 00:22:05.110
is that love is not only for yourself, but for everyone.

00:22:06.270 --> 00:22:12.230
It's a pure love for everyone else.

00:22:13.270 --> 00:22:18.150
It's not only for yourself. It's very surprising:

00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:26.190
when you really love yourself then your love is for yourself,

00:22:28.110 --> 00:22:34.470
and you start spreading that love

00:22:34.910 --> 00:22:41.190
in such a manner that you beautifully love others.

00:22:42.910 --> 00:22:45.590
You don't love for money,

00:22:46.030 --> 00:22:52.510
you don't love for some advantage, for some power

00:22:53.910 --> 00:23:00.910
or for some gain, but you love for love.

00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:06.030
Because pure love is so joy-giving.

00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:11.750
Is so joy-giving that  if there is any such thing that

00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:17.430
'I love somebody because I want to possess that person',

00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:22.430
'because I am something great',

00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:26.430
and 'if I love somebody

00:23:26.670 --> 00:23:31.230
then that person should feel absolutely obliged'

00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:38.110
all these ideas are absolutely of no avail.

00:23:39.150 --> 00:23:45.990
Really if you love, then you just love.

00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:50.830
You love everyone.

00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:55.230
You may say, "Mother, how can you love a crook?" 

00:23:56.870 --> 00:24:04.190
Need not go his way. Need not be with him.

00:24:05.230 --> 00:24:12.590
Need not have anything to do with him. But if you are pure love,

00:24:12.790 --> 00:24:19.190
then he can change, she can change. If they do not,

00:24:19.390 --> 00:24:27.390
then you don't bother. Those who come into the ocean of love,

00:24:28.110 --> 00:24:36.110
those who are really pure, loving people, they are your friends.

00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:41.910
They are the ones who are needed on this earth.

00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:47.630
Not the people who are crooks, who cheat you,

00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:52.190
who try to dominate you - they are not the ones needed.

00:24:52.550 --> 00:24:58.030
What we need are the people who are completely drenched

00:24:58.230 --> 00:25:02.510
into the purity of love.

00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:09.790
So, from love we go to another point which is purity.

00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:17.630
And the purity is a subject

00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:20.990
which has been talked about by many people.

00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:29.230
That you should be pure, you should be absolutely open

00:25:30.270 --> 00:25:34.830
and people should know everything about you.

00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:39.350
I don't think that is purity.

00:25:39.550 --> 00:25:43.350
Purity is that which purifies others!

00:25:45.030 --> 00:25:51.070
If you are a pure person, then others will be purified.

00:25:52.430 --> 00:25:54.630
They have to be purified.

00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:58.950
Now supposing you have certain ideas about yourself,

00:25:59.910 --> 00:26:07.910
you think that you are very highly placed as a Sahaja Yogi

00:26:09.910 --> 00:26:16.670
and that you are full of love. Maybe it's all imaginary.

00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:21.710
Does it purify others?

00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:28.670
Does your purity purify ohters?

00:26:29.230 --> 00:26:35.950
Can it give them awakening? Can they be Realised Souls?

00:26:37.270 --> 00:26:41.110
And then, how much do you value the purity,

00:26:41.310 --> 00:26:46.270
the power of purity? And how many people you give Realisation

00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:50.150
Or you have kept it to yourself?

00:26:51.310 --> 00:26:56.950
How many places you have been to spread this purity?

00:26:58.550 --> 00:27:01.230
Purity has to be spread.

00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:09.790
And without any doubt, in your own purity,

00:27:10.670 --> 00:27:15.470
you should do it because it's a very, very powerful thing.

00:27:17.150 --> 00:27:19.790
Purity is very powerful.

00:27:20.110 --> 00:27:24.430
It may not act on one or two persons, doesn't matter.

00:27:24.710 --> 00:27:26.750
There could be some very,very

00:27:26.950 --> 00:27:29.710
nasty, horrible fellows, doesn`t matter.

00:27:30.790 --> 00:27:38.790
But it will have an effect on very many sensitive persons

00:27:39.670 --> 00:27:45.470
who want to become Sahaja Yogis.

00:27:46.990 --> 00:27:54.030
You have to just test it. How people like you

00:27:54.270 --> 00:27:57.950
and how they are impressed by you.

00:28:05.550 --> 00:28:12.390
The Paramchaitanya, this all pervading power of Divine Love,

00:28:13.270 --> 00:28:17.910
flows through you because you are pure.

00:28:19.390 --> 00:28:26.750
If you are impure, then it will stop at different chakras,

00:28:27.550 --> 00:28:35.510
it won't work. So purity of temperament, purity of love

00:28:35.910 --> 00:28:39.710
what does that mean?  That you love somebody

00:28:40.030 --> 00:28:47.390
because that person has got spirituality!

00:28:49.150 --> 00:28:53.430
You love that person because there is purity,

00:28:54.270 --> 00:29:01.390
and you go to places just to spread the purity among them.

00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:08.110
A pure person will never create a problem.

00:29:09.070 --> 00:29:11.670
It's the impure person who every day

00:29:11.870 --> 00:29:15.350
can start with this problem or that problem and that ...

00:29:16.910 --> 00:29:21.950
So the character of a Yogi is

00:29:23.510 --> 00:29:31.190
to worship the purity of your own and the purity of others.

00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:39.630
It's true that we have to face ourselves everyday.

00:29:40.030 --> 00:29:44.270
It's true that we have to correct ourselves every day.

00:29:45.270 --> 00:29:49.790
It's true that we have to separate ourselves from ourselves

00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:54.590
to see how far we have done, how far we have gone,

00:29:55.390 --> 00:29:59.390
what are we doing, what have we done.

00:30:00.110 --> 00:30:05.190
So the difference between the ancient times guru

00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:11.910
and modern times guru is that the ancient times' gurus

00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:16.110
didn't care if they gave Realisation to people,

00:30:18.030 --> 00:30:21.670
it was not their style most of them.

00:30:22.350 --> 00:30:25.350
Only they cared for themselves, nicely sitting down

00:30:25.550 --> 00:30:31.270
somewhere in the Himalayas, away from all the madding crowd,

00:30:31.710 --> 00:30:37.670
and enjoying themselves! But you must share this enjoyment.

00:30:38.790 --> 00:30:46.030
I think that is the sign of a good guru. The one who cannot share,

00:30:46.350 --> 00:30:49.270
only looks after his own pleasures,

00:30:49.470 --> 00:30:53.150
or looks after his own ashram, we can call it,

00:30:53.470 --> 00:30:57.110
or looks after his own family,

00:30:57.550 --> 00:31:02.230
looks after maybe some disciples he has

00:31:03.350 --> 00:31:06.750
attention has to be for the whole world!

00:31:07.190 --> 00:31:10.430
In Sahaja Yoga, now, it has reached such a stage

00:31:10.630 --> 00:31:17.310
that you have to worry about the complete humanity.

00:31:17.670 --> 00:31:23.110
It's not only you, or a few Sahaja Yogis,

00:31:24.030 --> 00:31:26.070
or many more Sahaja Yogis,

00:31:26.990 --> 00:31:30.990
but all over the world, whatever is the problem,

00:31:31.190 --> 00:31:34.310
you people have to solve it.

00:31:35.470 --> 00:31:40.990
But first get out of your own little, little problems.

00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:46.830
I get letters from people, especially women,

00:31:47.030 --> 00:31:51.550
saying their husband is like that, and husband does that

00:31:51.790 --> 00:31:56.670
and children are suffering, and all kinds ...

00:31:58.070 --> 00:32:05.350
Now, you are a guru! Means you are such a high,

00:32:06.030 --> 00:32:10.790
highly electrified person with spirituality.

00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:16.270
Why should you worry about all this nonsensical things?

00:32:20.470 --> 00:32:28.390
And the consciousness that you are purified

00:32:29.910 --> 00:32:36.950
and that you are a pure person should make you very humble.

00:32:38.110 --> 00:32:43.670
Just the opposite of it - normally people, if they are anything,

00:32:44.350 --> 00:32:47.950
they become very proud and think no end of themselves.

00:32:48.790 --> 00:32:54.390
If they have, say, one power, they will become like that;

00:32:54.670 --> 00:32:58.710
if they have some talent, they become like this;

00:32:59.230 --> 00:33:03.310
if they have some eminence they become like this

00:33:04.710 --> 00:33:07.790
they do not become humble by that

00:33:07.990 --> 00:33:12.590
by that achievement they become extremely, extremely

00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:17.030
proud, arrogant

00:33:18.750 --> 00:33:24.110
absolutely in a very wrong shape!

00:33:25.230 --> 00:33:33.230
But you, you are a Sahaja Yogi and you should not mind

00:33:35.950 --> 00:33:42.270
anything that will bring down your purity.

00:33:52.710 --> 00:33:59.030
So, you can call yourself as gurus if you want.

00:33:59.470 --> 00:34:03.590
I need not say that you are a guru.

00:34:04.350 --> 00:34:12.190
But you have to first of all make your self your disciple!

00:34:12.950 --> 00:34:17.110
Must look after your self first of all.

00:34:21.150 --> 00:34:28.030
You have to see for yourself, 'Have I got the qualities?

00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:33.870
Am I the one who can really do all this?'

00:34:34.430 --> 00:34:40.230
All this introspection within you should be with a very clean heart

00:34:40.870 --> 00:34:43.830
and understanding.

00:34:45.550 --> 00:34:52.870
Because you are not incarnations, which are born absolutely pure,

00:34:53.350 --> 00:34:55.390
but you are human beings

00:34:55.590 --> 00:35:00.510
and you are rising to the level of those incarnations.

00:35:01.550 --> 00:35:06.070
So you have to cleanse, you have to watch yourself,

00:35:06.590 --> 00:35:10.550
see for yourself and then understand

00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:15.110
if you are a Sahaja Yogi - have you got

00:35:15.350 --> 00:35:20.910
the beauty of purity and love?

00:35:21.750 --> 00:35:29.750
Now this love is not relative, is not conditional,

00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:40.230
is not limited, but it is absolutely like an ocean.

00:35:44.230 --> 00:35:47.230
And you like to swim in that ocean,

00:35:47.430 --> 00:35:52.310
like to be drenched in that ocean of love.

00:35:53.110 --> 00:35:58.990
Formerly guru meant a person who is standing with a big stick.

00:35:59.350 --> 00:36:02.190
He used to hit everyone.

00:36:02.390 --> 00:36:07.350
Anybody did anything wrong they used to hit and beat them.

00:36:07.550 --> 00:36:12.070
We had gurus in music also, and different, different

00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:14.950
types of gurus we had in our country.

00:36:15.950 --> 00:36:22.070
And their speciality was that they used to

00:36:22.350 --> 00:36:29.630
absolutely oppress the disciple, control, and then teach

00:36:30.110 --> 00:36:37.750
the knowledge of music, maybe; maybe wrestling, maybe anything.

00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:44.710
But in Sahaja Yoga it's very different.

00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:51.870
Even the spiritual gurus who were real were like that.

00:36:52.550 --> 00:36:55.590
Very harsh.

00:36:56.790 --> 00:37:00.990
They used to throw stones at such people.

00:37:02.990 --> 00:37:06.190
All kinds of things they used to do

00:37:06.470 --> 00:37:13.270
they didn't mean anything bad, but the method I didn't like.

00:37:15.230 --> 00:37:17.590
There was a story about a person

00:37:18.070 --> 00:37:24.670
who was supposed to be a great guru, and I went to see him.

00:37:25.070 --> 00:37:30.430
I had to climb quite a lot because he lived in a small, little cave.

00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:35.310
And when I reached there, you see,

00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:39.390
he was very angry within and going on like this, like this

00:37:39.870 --> 00:37:44.630
And it was raining so I was completely drenched!

00:37:46.070 --> 00:37:52.150
And I went and sat in his little cave.

00:37:52.910 --> 00:37:58.710
Then he came back and he asked me a question.

00:38:00.590 --> 00:38:05.710
He said: "Mother, it was raining. Normally I can stop the rain,

00:38:05.990 --> 00:38:09.030
but you wouldn't allow me to stop the rain. Why?

00:38:10.830 --> 00:38:15.470
I could have told him 'Because of your ego'. I didn't.

00:38:16.590 --> 00:38:21.870
I told him in a very sweet manner, "You see, you are a sanyasi

00:38:22.590 --> 00:38:27.590
and you have got a sari for me. If I had not got drenched,

00:38:27.790 --> 00:38:32.430
I could not have taken your sari from a sanyasi" .

00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:39.430
He completely melted! He had tears in his eyes and fell at My Feet.

00:38:40.390 --> 00:38:47.870
So the technique of Sahaja Yoga is like this. It's not anger.

00:38:49.750 --> 00:38:57.350
It's not repulsion. It's not hatred. But the technique is such

00:38:57.550 --> 00:39:00.990
by which you suggest your love.

00:39:04.990 --> 00:39:08.790
This is how one has to understand

00:39:08.990 --> 00:39:15.430
the difference between a Sahaja Yogi guru and other gurus.

00:39:19.550 --> 00:39:25.510
No question of beating your disciple, no question of scolding,

00:39:25.790 --> 00:39:31.750
no question of shouting at them. Love is the most powerful thing!

00:39:31.950 --> 00:39:36.390
Of course it doesn't work on some people, I agree forget them.

00:39:37.470 --> 00:39:41.710
But it works in most of the people because

00:39:41.910 --> 00:39:48.310
God has made us out of His love and we have a capacity

00:39:49.470 --> 00:39:54.030
to yield to that love and to enjoy that love.

00:39:56.550 --> 00:40:03.070
So, for a Sahaja Yogi, what he has to do is to understand

00:40:03.590 --> 00:40:09.030
the powers of love. Powers of love,

00:40:10.270 --> 00:40:14.230
if you can understand, it will grow within you.

00:40:14.750 --> 00:40:18.670
Some people have, some people don't have it.

00:40:19.350 --> 00:40:24.830
Try to understand, this Paramchaitanya is nothing

00:40:25.110 --> 00:40:32.550
but it is (the) power of God's love or you can say 'Mother's love'!

00:40:32.910 --> 00:40:38.590
This power works so beautifully,

00:40:38.950 --> 00:40:46.830
in such a secret manner, that you call it as 'miracle'.

00:40:48.910 --> 00:40:53.110
Because you can't see how it has worked.

00:40:53.430 --> 00:40:58.030
So first and foremost thing is,

00:40:58.350 --> 00:41:05.590
try to develop the sense of love within you.

00:41:06.310 --> 00:41:14.030
Understand. There is one problem which is always misunderstood.

00:41:14.750 --> 00:41:18.990
Pure love can be very easily understood,

00:41:20.870 --> 00:41:28.990
that it gives you joy, that it helps others to improve,

00:41:29.430 --> 00:41:34.390
it works in a very subtle manner.

00:41:36.670 --> 00:41:42.030
Now try to remember when you came to Sahaja Yoga,

00:41:42.390 --> 00:41:46.710
try to remember how you got your Realisation,

00:41:47.990 --> 00:41:52.030
try to remember how you started growing.

00:41:53.990 --> 00:42:01.990
These are like the seeds within us of love,

00:42:02.710 --> 00:42:07.950
which sprouted. Slowly and gradually we started

00:42:08.710 --> 00:42:13.830
the showers of blessings of love.

00:42:14.190 --> 00:42:19.110
Then we started enjoying it and understanding it.

00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:24.350
Now at this stage when we are about to become gurus and we are

00:42:24.550 --> 00:42:30.430
already gurus, should be nothing but embodiment of love.

00:42:31.470 --> 00:42:34.910
It's a very different theory I am telling you.

00:42:35.190 --> 00:42:37.190
No guru will accept this

00:42:37.470 --> 00:42:44.230
those who are already accepted as gurus all over.

00:42:49.590 --> 00:42:55.510
And the knowledge, knowledge they give you,

00:42:56.350 --> 00:43:04.270
is the knowledge of very subtle things.

00:43:07.830 --> 00:43:15.030
All the knowledge that you have got in Sahaja Yoga has been already

00:43:16.030 --> 00:43:19.550
told by those gurus long time back.

00:43:19.830 --> 00:43:22.070
Somebody has told this, somebody has told that,

00:43:22.310 --> 00:43:26.430
somebody has told that ...

00:43:26.670 --> 00:43:31.750
But all the knowledge, the total knowledge

00:43:32.150 --> 00:43:38.190
about your being, your chakras, everything, which you know now,

00:43:38.550 --> 00:43:42.830
is with you. That is the truth.

00:43:43.470 --> 00:43:51.470
You have the complete subtle knowledge which nobody had before.

00:43:52.830 --> 00:43:57.870
Because maybe these gurus did not want to give,

00:43:58.390 --> 00:44:02.990
or maybe these gurus did not know themselves.

00:44:04.950 --> 00:44:10.590
All the knowledge of Sahaja Yoga is simple,

00:44:11.030 --> 00:44:18.870
very subtle and is real. Now, after having this within you,

00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:25.710
should not be just mental it should be spiritual.

00:44:26.630 --> 00:44:34.510
And to make it spiritual, what have you to do is to love!

00:44:35.310 --> 00:44:38.390
When you love others, you will start working on them.

00:44:39.390 --> 00:44:42.630
Then you will find out, with your knowledge,

00:44:42.870 --> 00:44:49.030
that there is something wrong with this fellow: what is wrong?

00:44:49.230 --> 00:44:53.470
He has this chakra, he has that chakra this is the combination,

00:44:53.750 --> 00:44:59.230
that is it. But a Sahaja Yogi doesn't get angry on that point.

00:44:59.470 --> 00:45:01.990
He tries to cure that person.

00:45:05.110 --> 00:45:10.110
He tries to improve that person.

00:45:11.270 --> 00:45:17.670
He doesn't say "You are very bad, you are horrible" . No, no.

00:45:18.270 --> 00:45:24.430
He takes up a challenge that 'With my pure love I can cure'.

00:45:28.390 --> 00:45:33.470
It is so simple for him;

00:45:33.910 --> 00:45:37.470
not like any doctor or anybody

00:45:37.750 --> 00:45:42.710
who has certain great qualifications that he would come and ask for

00:45:43.790 --> 00:45:50.190
the fees and that he will charge you this money nothing!

00:45:50.590 --> 00:45:52.630
He knows what's wrong with you

00:45:53.190 --> 00:45:58.590
and he knows how to cure it. And he does it that way.

00:46:01.710 --> 00:46:08.790
So, you are not afraid. Apart from... you are not afraid,

00:46:09.390 --> 00:46:12.350
that person who is with you also is not afraid

00:46:12.630 --> 00:46:17.830
because of your temperament, because of your nature:

00:46:18.350 --> 00:46:22.310
the way you are handling the patient, the way you are

00:46:22.550 --> 00:46:27.590
talking to a person who has come to know about the truth.

00:46:29.670 --> 00:46:34.950
And thus you give him also the truth.

00:46:35.230 --> 00:46:39.110
Also you teach him what is  the truth is.

00:46:39.430 --> 00:46:47.150
And the truth is very simple that you are the Spirit!

00:46:49.430 --> 00:46:56.190
This is the truth, is revealed loud to another person.

00:46:58.270 --> 00:47:05.990
Thus you realise yourself, by giving Realisation to another person,

00:47:06.310 --> 00:47:12.390
what you have done is to give him the truth itself

00:47:12.950 --> 00:47:16.910
absolute truth.

00:47:20.950 --> 00:47:28.910
I know... these days people find it very difficult to find any time

00:47:31.550 --> 00:47:35.190
for Sahaja Yoga, for spreading Sahja Yoga

00:47:35.390 --> 00:47:38.630
they are looking out for  holidays.

00:47:44.190 --> 00:47:49.790
Whatever it is, whatever is happening,

00:47:50.310 --> 00:47:56.750
I am very sure with your great powers that you have,

00:47:59.990 --> 00:48:06.070
you can really show great, great success,

00:48:06.790 --> 00:48:14.590
very great success. And this success can bring forth

00:48:15.670 --> 00:48:22.550
the vision I have of saving the humanity all over the world.

00:48:24.990 --> 00:48:28.590
May God bless you
