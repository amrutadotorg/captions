Title: Talk on evening before Sahastrara Puja
Location: Thredbo, Australia

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:17.560
Date: 2.5.1987

00:03:30.774 --> 00:03:40.563
So very nice to see you all here, all my children.

00:03:40.563 --> 00:03:49.084
Your love out beats me.

00:03:49.084 --> 00:03:56.884
I really find no words to express my feelings.

00:03:56.884 --> 00:04:08.694
The way you have taken to Sahaja Yoga and
the way you have established yourself in Sahaj

00:04:08.694 --> 00:04:09.694
Yog.

00:04:09.694 --> 00:04:16.244
I know it is very difficult to spread Sahaja
Yoga.

00:04:16.244 --> 00:04:25.384
Everywhere it is difficult because you know
these are the times of kaliyuga.

00:04:25.384 --> 00:04:37.904
I am not tired of the journey so much as the
fighting the evil forces around us.

00:04:37.904 --> 00:04:48.813
When I came to Canberra, I felt the left swadhistana
very strong, so strong that I could not walk

00:04:48.813 --> 00:04:53.734
few steps and I asked them what’s the matter?

00:04:53.734 --> 00:05:01.984
They told me that TM, there is some Chinmoy
fellow, they are very strong here.

00:05:01.984 --> 00:05:09.813
Apart from that there are other spiritualist
forces which they are announcing in the newspapers.

00:05:09.813 --> 00:05:22.084
It’s shocking that human beings take to
these horrible things so easily and try to

00:05:22.084 --> 00:05:24.033
work it out.

00:05:24.033 --> 00:05:33.214
When you study the reason why they take to
these horrible things then you realize one

00:05:33.214 --> 00:05:40.634
thing that these things promise quick results.

00:05:40.634 --> 00:05:44.554
Like supposing somebody’s son has been lost.

00:05:44.554 --> 00:05:47.574
So, they will say, “All right.

00:05:47.574 --> 00:05:51.924
You come to our group, we’ll find it out
for you.”

00:05:51.924 --> 00:05:56.694
Or else, somebody says, “I am under a great
strain.”

00:05:56.694 --> 00:05:57.714
“All right.

00:05:57.714 --> 00:06:01.154
You come to our group, we will remove your
strains.”

00:06:01.154 --> 00:06:11.104
It’s very easy to remove the strains by
putting a entity, what we call the bhoots,

00:06:11.104 --> 00:06:15.784
into someone so that the bhoot takes over
for the time being.

00:06:15.784 --> 00:06:21.244
But, here the seeker is not a deep person.

00:06:21.244 --> 00:06:26.104
Those who were deep people came back from
all these horrible people.

00:06:26.104 --> 00:06:35.914
With the TM, I can tell you, we have been
able to salvage some people, not all of them.

00:06:35.914 --> 00:06:45.864
When first it was brought to my notice, I
had a meeting in England and we had from TM

00:06:45.864 --> 00:06:47.594
at least hundred people.

00:06:47.594 --> 00:06:55.774
Out of which we can say about ten to twelve
people we have been able to salvage.

00:06:55.774 --> 00:07:03.204
But the growth, spiritual growth in them was
very slow and they were just frightened of

00:07:03.204 --> 00:07:04.204
Me.

00:07:04.204 --> 00:07:05.204
They would not look at Me.

00:07:05.204 --> 00:07:07.874
They had awe about Me.

00:07:07.874 --> 00:07:11.794
Whenever they saw me they would shake.

00:07:11.794 --> 00:07:20.624
There is one fellow, Chinese, who came from
TM, and I think Rustom was there, and he just

00:07:20.624 --> 00:07:30.315
took My name and he jumped under a table and
landed himself outside in the lounge and they

00:07:30.315 --> 00:07:34.844
started looking at him where has he disappeared.

00:07:34.844 --> 00:07:43.444
With this Chinese fellow, we tried with him,
but he used to shake and horrible [UNCLEAR],

00:07:43.444 --> 00:07:44.444
poor thing.

00:07:44.444 --> 00:07:58.464
Then he left Sahaja Yoga in a way and somebody
met him in a restaurant or in a book shop

00:07:58.464 --> 00:08:04.314
and somebody met him there, and they asked
him, “How do you feel?

00:08:04.314 --> 00:08:06.764
How do you feel about Mother?”

00:08:06.764 --> 00:08:07.764
He said, “Oh!

00:08:07.764 --> 00:08:08.764
Ho!

00:08:08.764 --> 00:08:09.764
Ho!

00:08:09.764 --> 00:08:10.764
Ho!

00:08:10.764 --> 00:08:11.764
She is a tremendous power.”

00:08:11.764 --> 00:08:19.804
So, you see, they are so weak, they are so
gone down.

00:08:19.804 --> 00:08:23.314
It’s very difficult to bring them to normal
conditions.

00:08:23.314 --> 00:08:26.494
Within two, three years they become recluses.

00:08:26.494 --> 00:08:32.164
They are even afraid of, what you call garlic.

00:08:32.164 --> 00:08:34.674
If you show them the garlic they start shaking.

00:08:34.674 --> 00:08:38.574
If you show them the lemon they start shaking.

00:08:38.574 --> 00:08:40.534
They become recluses.

00:08:40.534 --> 00:08:47.674
We get few people from there, TM, but their
bhoots are so strong that they will not stick

00:08:47.674 --> 00:08:48.714
on to us much.

00:08:48.714 --> 00:08:53.054
Even they come down for a short time, again
they go back.

00:08:53.054 --> 00:08:57.204
So, this is the situation with these TM people.

00:08:57.204 --> 00:09:08.014
And with this Chinmoy fellow I had an encounter
in America and there the people they came

00:09:08.014 --> 00:09:15.084
and told me that “Why this Chinmoy is here
and why doesn’t your husband tell to Secretary

00:09:15.084 --> 00:09:16.674
General about it?”

00:09:16.674 --> 00:09:21.854
And you know who was the Secretary General
that time, [Wol Dahm?] and all the rest of

00:09:21.854 --> 00:09:23.744
it.

00:09:23.744 --> 00:09:25.174
And they were all crazy people.

00:09:25.174 --> 00:09:29.994
How Wol Dahm is now being cheated by people
and now he is not allowed to go to America

00:09:29.994 --> 00:09:30.994
and all that.

00:09:30.994 --> 00:09:37.894
Actually his luck was not so bad but this
bhoots, you see, they made him so funny that

00:09:37.894 --> 00:09:42.284
he just could not come back to his normal
self.

00:09:42.284 --> 00:09:50.373
Now this gentleman was not so much into this
Chinmoy but there was one south Indian gentleman

00:09:50.373 --> 00:09:54.334
who was in the UN and he said that “This
Chinmoy is very good.”

00:09:54.334 --> 00:10:02.043
This Chinmoy used to play tennis, used to
swim, used to drink, have women, he was a

00:10:02.043 --> 00:10:06.104
real yanky and despite that people said, “Oh!

00:10:06.104 --> 00:10:10.153
He is great because he knows how to speak
well.”

00:10:10.153 --> 00:10:15.404
So, all those speech loving people he got.

00:10:15.404 --> 00:10:22.134
That’s another style of people who are not
seekers but who just want somebody to talk,

00:10:22.134 --> 00:10:23.624
talk, and talk.

00:10:23.624 --> 00:10:29.444
He could talk on Gita, he could talk on this,
he could talk on every kind of thing.

00:10:29.444 --> 00:10:38.733
Now, the big difference is, in Sahaja Yoga
you have to accept Me.

00:10:38.733 --> 00:10:42.233
There you don’t have to accept anyone.

00:10:42.233 --> 00:10:48.264
As long as you accept Gita, as long as you
accept Bible, as long as you accept something

00:10:48.264 --> 00:10:51.264
– is not there, which is dead, which is
finished.

00:10:51.264 --> 00:10:56.774
So, these people are interested only in your
money.

00:10:56.774 --> 00:11:05.274
So, they don’t worry about these old, we
should say, prophets who are dead now or we

00:11:05.274 --> 00:11:06.493
can say the incarnations who are dead.

00:11:06.493 --> 00:11:09.483
They have nothing to do.

00:11:09.483 --> 00:11:11.454
Just they describe them, take the money.

00:11:11.454 --> 00:11:13.024
That’s they want.

00:11:13.024 --> 00:11:17.043
They only want to have money, money, money
and money.

00:11:17.043 --> 00:11:20.004
They are not interested in your welfare or
anything.

00:11:20.004 --> 00:11:25.603
They have no idea of Kundalini, they cannot
raise your Kundalini, they cannot give you

00:11:25.603 --> 00:11:30.144
realization, they cannot look after you – nothing
of the kind.

00:11:30.144 --> 00:11:32.983
Only thing what they want, whatever money
you have they should have it.

00:11:32.983 --> 00:11:40.634
And the way they do it is a very camouflage
sort of a drama they play, that they can deliver

00:11:40.634 --> 00:11:41.634
the goods.

00:11:41.634 --> 00:11:48.944
What are the goods they are going to deliver
to you?

00:11:48.944 --> 00:11:50.653
Except Self-Realization.

00:11:50.653 --> 00:11:56.543
Even the people who talked of Self-Realization
never gave Self-Realization to anyone.

00:11:56.543 --> 00:11:59.163
I have seen this Yogananda’s disciples.

00:11:59.163 --> 00:12:07.363
The early ones, they had to cut their tongues
because according to him, in his own kriyayoga,

00:12:07.363 --> 00:12:15.173
you had to put back your tongue here for a
khechri and that’s why they had to cut their

00:12:15.173 --> 00:12:16.173
tongue.

00:12:16.173 --> 00:12:17.173
They cannot speak, they cannot do anything.

00:12:17.173 --> 00:12:20.293
They are just like dogs, you see, wagging
their tails.

00:12:20.293 --> 00:12:26.743
Very good people, they are doctors, architects,
very good people.

00:12:26.743 --> 00:12:32.653
All these things have happened to all these
great seekers, I should say, but they were

00:12:32.653 --> 00:12:36.014
stupid to accept anyone like that.

00:12:36.014 --> 00:12:43.584
First of all, you must see what are other,
are doing others, say other disciples are

00:12:43.584 --> 00:12:44.584
doing.

00:12:44.584 --> 00:12:46.324
How are they, majority of them?

00:12:46.324 --> 00:12:52.704
In Sahaja Yoga also we might get somebody
a very useless person and might get somebody

00:12:52.704 --> 00:12:57.034
a very low grade or a very low caliber personality.

00:12:57.034 --> 00:13:01.064
We do get on the periphery, we do get.

00:13:01.064 --> 00:13:05.954
But they should see other people who are seriously
involved in Sahaja Yoga.

00:13:05.954 --> 00:13:07.814
How they are behaving?

00:13:07.814 --> 00:13:10.233
What is their way of doing it?

00:13:10.233 --> 00:13:12.254
And how their life is?

00:13:12.254 --> 00:13:13.774
What have they achieved?

00:13:13.774 --> 00:13:15.754
What powers have they achieved?

00:13:15.754 --> 00:13:18.884
And what kind of a life they lead?

00:13:18.884 --> 00:13:22.904
That is how you should judge the person to
whom they have to do.

00:13:22.904 --> 00:13:29.014
I am sorry that this Canberra is so full of
Left Swadistana and if you allow these things

00:13:29.014 --> 00:13:31.603
to continue I don’t know what will happen
to your government.

00:13:31.603 --> 00:13:38.993
It will all go to dogs if this stupid thing
is allowed to work out because all those booths

00:13:38.993 --> 00:13:43.384
will jump on all these civil servants and
serious things can happen.

00:13:43.384 --> 00:13:54.064
I am quite surprised how it is allowed in
Australia where is the land of Shri Ganesha.

00:13:54.064 --> 00:14:00.184
As it is I am here now, I am sure something
will happen and they will give up that.

00:14:00.184 --> 00:14:06.803
But as far as coming to Sahaja Yoga, I would
say, it’s a headache.

00:14:06.803 --> 00:14:11.834
You better give yourselves a bandhan before
touching them anywhere near because they will

00:14:11.834 --> 00:14:13.293
give you lot of trouble.

00:14:13.293 --> 00:14:15.004
I have had lots of trouble with them.

00:14:15.004 --> 00:14:18.154
So much so, we had to leave one of our ashrams.

00:14:18.154 --> 00:14:26.114
You see, we had three persons in that ashram
from TM and they used to scream so much and

00:14:26.114 --> 00:14:30.543
this jumping about was so much that the neighbors
told us that, ”You better get out from here”

00:14:30.543 --> 00:14:33.444
and because of them we had to get out.

00:14:33.444 --> 00:14:35.973
All kinds of funny things they do.

00:14:35.973 --> 00:14:42.144
First time I saw these TM people, were in
a hall, and they took the first chairs.

00:14:42.144 --> 00:14:44.014
First row they were sitting there.

00:14:44.014 --> 00:14:48.404
As soon as I started speaking they all started
jumping like jack in the box.

00:14:48.404 --> 00:14:50.973
I was wondering, “What‘s the matter?

00:14:50.973 --> 00:14:51.973
Is perfectly alright?

00:14:51.973 --> 00:14:53.103
Who are these people?”

00:14:53.103 --> 00:14:54.903
I had never seen such a thing before.

00:14:54.903 --> 00:15:00.074
I was quite surprised that who are these people
jumping like this one by one.

00:15:00.074 --> 00:15:05.444
Then I asked them, they said, “We do TM
and we are doing siddha course.”

00:15:05.444 --> 00:15:06.444
“Siddha course?

00:15:06.444 --> 00:15:09.014
Stupid people you are, that’s what you are.”

00:15:09.014 --> 00:15:17.303
And out of these 6 or 7 people who were jumping
we could save about, I should say, two or

00:15:17.303 --> 00:15:18.303
three.

00:15:18.303 --> 00:15:22.184
So, those people who have gone to that you
shouldn’t worry so much about them.

00:15:22.184 --> 00:15:27.274
But, of course, if it is gone to the government
it is better to beat the government with shoes

00:15:27.274 --> 00:15:31.723
and give bandhan to the government so that
they don’t get entangled with it.

00:15:31.723 --> 00:15:38.093
But is serious thing and I have to work it
out myself on those lines because I was quite

00:15:38.093 --> 00:15:43.613
shocked that in Canberra they have such bad
vibrations.

00:15:43.613 --> 00:15:49.344
I came to Canberra much before with my husband
and I told him that “The vibrations here

00:15:49.344 --> 00:15:50.773
are very, very bad.”

00:15:50.773 --> 00:15:53.233
So he said, ”All the capital cities are
like that.”

00:15:53.233 --> 00:15:59.783
I said, “But it seems rather funny that
both the centers are catching so badly.”

00:15:59.783 --> 00:16:04.833
And I couldn’t walk that time also and today
also the same thing happened to Me.

00:16:04.833 --> 00:16:09.824
Now, we have many other people who are seeking
God.

00:16:09.824 --> 00:16:12.594
They live in the villages.

00:16:12.594 --> 00:16:18.254
These people have not gone to the villages
because they wanted only rich people, monied

00:16:18.254 --> 00:16:19.254
people.

00:16:19.254 --> 00:16:24.644
So, there are many people in the villages
who haven’t yet received their Self-Realization

00:16:24.644 --> 00:16:28.653
and they can receive their Self-Realization
without any difficulties.

00:16:28.653 --> 00:16:35.303
You can go there and talk to them and get
them realized because they are not people

00:16:35.303 --> 00:16:42.533
for whom these rakshashas are waiting.

00:16:42.533 --> 00:16:44.624
We have to give them realization.

00:16:44.624 --> 00:16:48.803
Once you give realization to people in the
villages, things will change.

00:16:48.803 --> 00:16:53.374
The atmosphere will change and you find lots
of people coming to Sahaja Yoga.

00:16:53.374 --> 00:16:59.303
So, I would say, I am very happy that in Sydney
itself we have so many centers and in other

00:16:59.303 --> 00:17:01.173
cities you have so many centers.

00:17:01.173 --> 00:17:04.084
But now we have to reach the villages and
see them.

00:17:04.084 --> 00:17:11.143
They are innocent, simple people living in
the villages in a very simple manner and is

00:17:11.143 --> 00:17:20.954
better to give them proper attention because
they are the ones who will get realization.

00:17:20.954 --> 00:17:24.853
Then the children, children should be attended
to.

00:17:24.853 --> 00:17:31.643
They can be very nicely brought to Sahaj and
because there may be many of them who are

00:17:31.643 --> 00:17:33.264
already born realized.

00:17:33.264 --> 00:17:38.084
So the children can be brought into Sahaja
Yoga but not without the permission of their

00:17:38.084 --> 00:17:43.764
parents because the laws and regulations are
such that we may land up in the prison without

00:17:43.764 --> 00:17:48.064
asking the permission of the father or mother.

00:17:48.064 --> 00:17:49.064
So, one has to be very careful.

00:17:49.064 --> 00:17:58.083
The another are the adolescent boys and girls
who are studying in the colleges and who are

00:17:58.083 --> 00:18:01.583
not yet exposed so much to all these bad things.

00:18:01.583 --> 00:18:07.303
They might be drug addicts little bit or may
be other addiction they might be having but

00:18:07.303 --> 00:18:13.814
they are not yet touched by these horrible
evil forces.

00:18:13.814 --> 00:18:17.464
So, you can just attend to them.

00:18:17.464 --> 00:18:24.294
You can also advertise that you can look after
people who are addicted to all these drugs

00:18:24.294 --> 00:18:25.294
and all that.

00:18:25.294 --> 00:18:26.864
You can relieve them.

00:18:26.864 --> 00:18:33.644
If you are allowed to do that you can advertise,
get those people and if you give them realization

00:18:33.644 --> 00:18:37.644
they might be able to get over their addiction
completely.

00:18:37.644 --> 00:18:44.894
There is a doctor, Dr. Wells, in London who
has now become a very big doctor in charge

00:18:44.894 --> 00:18:45.894
of a hospital of addiction.

00:18:45.894 --> 00:18:47.854
So, I said, “What do you do to them?

00:18:47.854 --> 00:18:51.734
How do you manage this addiction business?”

00:18:51.734 --> 00:18:57.984
He said, “In their absence I beat them with
shoes, that’s all and they are all getting

00:18:57.984 --> 00:18:59.254
rid of their addiction.”

00:18:59.254 --> 00:19:06.044
So, you can attend to those boys who are now
grown up boys and are taking to drugs and

00:19:06.044 --> 00:19:07.044
things like that.

00:19:07.044 --> 00:19:08.044
They are seekers.

00:19:08.044 --> 00:19:10.784
That’s why they are going to these things.

00:19:10.784 --> 00:19:16.614
I think this kind of an attitude if you have
that you are not going to attend to people

00:19:16.614 --> 00:19:21.144
who are already with some gurus and with something
and encounter them.

00:19:21.144 --> 00:19:28.654
But attend to people who by their innocence
have fallen into some problems or to the innocent

00:19:28.654 --> 00:19:32.424
people in the villages or children who are
innocent.

00:19:32.424 --> 00:19:35.904
I am sure you can prosper faster.

00:19:35.904 --> 00:19:42.324
So, Sahaja Yoga is growing very much faster
here and in a way in a city it is growing.

00:19:42.324 --> 00:19:48.374
We can grow much faster, I think, the way
there are people, so many people, are in the

00:19:48.374 --> 00:19:54.534
villages and in the countryside; in a very
simple way they live.

00:19:54.534 --> 00:20:01.874
As for Myself, to come to Australia is such
an excitement and such a joy because last

00:20:01.874 --> 00:20:08.344
year I could not come and this year when they
said it was a Sahastrar Puja and had to perform

00:20:08.344 --> 00:20:13.184
here and be there, I was very happy.

00:20:13.184 --> 00:20:20.244
Tomorrow we have to have that Puja.

00:20:20.244 --> 00:20:27.244
I was also a person in a way you can say,
a seeker, because I was trying to find out

00:20:27.244 --> 00:20:32.364
a method, the way, by which I could really
give en-masse realization.

00:20:32.364 --> 00:20:41.504
I could give realization to many people at
the same time and for that I was really working

00:20:41.504 --> 00:20:47.584
very, very hard, understanding lots of people,
human beings, and out of them I found bureaucrats

00:20:47.584 --> 00:20:49.504
are the worse.

00:20:49.504 --> 00:20:56.094
As you have lots of bureaucrats in this Canberra,
may be, that they are not so good because

00:20:56.094 --> 00:20:59.194
they have to compromise all the time.

00:20:59.194 --> 00:21:06.104
They have to say, “Yes sir, yes sir,”
and despite their resistance, despite their

00:21:06.104 --> 00:21:19.864
not liking, to say that, they are poor things,
pushed into a job where they have to work

00:21:19.864 --> 00:21:24.884
it out because after all job is important.

00:21:24.884 --> 00:21:28.994
When all these things become important, the
person’s personality suffers a lot.

00:21:28.994 --> 00:21:37.964
That’s what I found that the bureaucrats
who are seeking all the time power, go after

00:21:37.964 --> 00:21:43.894
the man who can give them some more power,
in the sense the power not of the divine but

00:21:43.894 --> 00:21:49.524
over the people that they can dominate more
people and they can manage more people.

00:21:49.524 --> 00:21:53.844
And that’s why these people fall into these
groups because in the beginning they feel

00:21:53.844 --> 00:22:00.204
relaxed in a way and they dominate many people
as there are booths sitting with them who

00:22:00.204 --> 00:22:01.204
give them ideas.

00:22:01.204 --> 00:22:05.554
But then they get tired of them and then they
fall sick.

00:22:05.554 --> 00:22:08.704
So, many people commit suicide also, suicide.

00:22:08.704 --> 00:22:17.504
I was told that suicide is maximum, suicide
cases are maximum in Canberra.

00:22:17.504 --> 00:22:22.664
The reason is this only that you don’t know
what to do with yourself.

00:22:22.664 --> 00:22:25.564
You suffer from some sort of a miserable disease.

00:22:25.564 --> 00:22:31.564
You don’t know how to get out of it and
then you commit suicide.

00:22:31.564 --> 00:22:41.834
So, all these things are connected with the
attack of the evil forces and these evil forces

00:22:41.834 --> 00:22:44.774
attack you in a very subtle manner.

00:22:44.774 --> 00:22:49.514
So, one should be careful as to mature.

00:22:49.514 --> 00:22:56.044
One has to mature in Sahaja Yoga so that nothing
can affect them, nothing can trouble them,

00:22:56.044 --> 00:22:58.174
nothing can bother them.

00:22:58.174 --> 00:22:59.784
One has to mature.

00:22:59.784 --> 00:23:02.204
The maturity should be such as like Mine.

00:23:02.204 --> 00:23:08.064
If I catch it, I mean, I deliberately catch
it and then I try to solve the problem.

00:23:08.064 --> 00:23:13.624
But if you cannot do that then you should
not catch also because you will suffer little

00:23:13.624 --> 00:23:15.804
bit by catching them.

00:23:15.804 --> 00:23:22.064
Now, for tomorrow’s puja I hope you will
all be ready and you will all enjoy tomorrow’s

00:23:22.064 --> 00:23:23.064
puja.

00:23:23.064 --> 00:23:27.574
Had a very nice puja in Pune which I had to
perform on the thirteenth because it is the

00:23:27.574 --> 00:23:34.934
date called Akshaya Thrithya, means undestructible
third day of the moon.

00:23:34.934 --> 00:23:37.974
That’s actually nobody knew, but it is the
puja of the Kundalini.

00:23:37.974 --> 00:23:43.634
That day everybody felt very, very clear.

00:23:43.634 --> 00:23:45.314
Very clear.

00:23:45.314 --> 00:23:52.134
Puja was hardly for about half an hour, the
real puja of the Kundalini.

00:23:52.134 --> 00:23:56.094
But everybody felt extremely clear and beautiful.

00:23:56.094 --> 00:24:02.364
So, that sort of puja we should do tomorrow
also, if possible, so that we’ll have the

00:24:02.364 --> 00:24:11.874
feelings of Sahastrara completely opened out
because even if Sahastrara is opened, the

00:24:11.874 --> 00:24:16.184
rest of the chakras, if they are caught up
then you have problems.

00:24:16.184 --> 00:24:20.665
It’s better to clear out all the chakras
and then the Sahastrara.

00:24:20.665 --> 00:24:25.774
So, tomorrow we’ll do the puja in that fashion
and I hope it will work out very well for

00:24:25.774 --> 00:24:26.774
all of you.

00:24:26.774 --> 00:24:37.894
I hope I have been rather late for all of
you and I am not taking too much of your time

00:24:37.894 --> 00:24:38.894
here.

00:24:38.894 --> 00:24:49.604
Tomorrow I think it should be, you see, actually
you’ll be surprised that this is the time

00:24:49.604 --> 00:24:53.754
I opened the Sahastrara in India.

00:24:53.754 --> 00:25:03.086
This is exactly the time because just now
is 6.30 there, 6.35 and about 6.30, I opened

00:25:03.087 --> 00:25:04.954
Sahastrara.

00:25:04.957 --> 00:25:09.286
So, you can imagine this is the time I opened
the Sahastrara there and

00:25:09.287 --> 00:25:11.971
this is the time we are sitting on

00:25:11.972 --> 00:25:17.350
the other side of the world and celebrating
that day, that great day

00:25:17.351 --> 00:25:20.667
of Sahastrara being opened out.

00:25:20.668 --> 00:25:25.950
It’s a very great day in the history of
spirituality, very great day for the whole

00:25:25.951 --> 00:25:27.067
world.

00:25:27.068 --> 00:25:29.600
They will realize one day what it was.

00:25:29.601 --> 00:25:33.367
such a big time that Sahastrara could

00:25:33.368 --> 00:25:35.933
be opened for masses.

00:25:35.934 --> 00:25:41.000
Not only that but you are empowered to do
that great work.

00:25:41.001 --> 00:25:43.300
May God bless you.
