00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280
Shri Mataji has asked me to share with you what

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:08.160
was the last experience of Her Divine visit in Russia.

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:13.560
And I must say it was really a dramatic breakthrough,

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:22.120
because in the scientific conference She had in Moscow,

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.120
there was the participation of a very well known scientist,

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.840
a physicist.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.400
His name is Anatoli Akimov, he is very well known

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.760
all over Russia and all over the world also.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.360
And he came with a theory and he has been studying

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.320
this theory for a few years,

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.720
which is based on the vacuum body and he studied

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.960
something like the torsion fields and he could explain

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.040
in a very clear way, in a very scientific way,

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.880
the vibrations that Shri Mataji is emitting.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.320
So, at the beginning he was studying some Yogis

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:13.520
which were meditating and he could notice that

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.720
they were emitting vibrations,

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.960
there was an aura around them.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:21.920
But then, when he came to Shri Mataji,

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.680
when he saw Her pictures, the miraculous pictures,

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.440
then he could really find out what it was and he said

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:37.360
that in Her case, it was something which is infinite,

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.360
which is unlimited.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.160
And also it was very nice, because at one point he said:

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.120
"As a man of science, I have to admit that

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.720
all the scientists that so far made some exceptional,

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.200
unique discovery...,

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.680
I have to admit that all this did not come

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.640
through some scientific process, through the brain,

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:06.920
we can say.

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:13.120
But it come only through some divine inspiration.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.680
We can mention Newton, we can mention Einstein and so on."

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.960
And he said: "Also in my case, when I was studying

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.000
and working on this theory, at some point

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.600
when I saw the picture of Shri Mataji

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.480
then I got the inspiration."

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.280
And then now Shri Mataji has invited him

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.960
in September to come.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.680
And he has already written a book in Russia

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.120
which will be translated in English and he is preparing

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.920
a new book on which of course the major topic will be

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.080
this unique discovery.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.520
So now we have somebody

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.760
who has scientifically proved what Shri Mataji is.

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:30.160
In Russia the people somehow are very open-minded.

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.160
Not only that,

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.520
the scientists specially are very open-minded

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.280
and were suppressed very much,

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.680
so they tried to find out

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.920
the subtler things;

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:52.440
not only finding out about chemicals

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:58.720
or about some physical properties of the light,

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:04.200
but they wanted to go into the subtler side.

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.920
And they had find, found out

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:13.000
already a great deal of knowledge

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.120
about the auras -- auras around the hand,

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:17.920
auras around the body --

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:21.080
they had done so much of research

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:25.680
and it was accepted all over the world, their findings.

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.040
Now this gentleman was a specialist, I think,

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.800
because he's a very well-known, very, very well-known person

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.520
and he's holding a very big position.

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.440
He was saying that he was, he has to run 150 organizations --

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.680
very humble and very nice person.

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:49.120
And when he came out with this discovery

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:54.600
I was happy in a way, because scientifically if it is proved,

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.920
then nobody can challenge it.

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.760
He has already written a book with all the algebraical

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:04.360
complications of what he wanted to prove.

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.160
And he said there is a vacuum,

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.760
beyond the consciousness there's vacuum,

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:14.680
and in that vacuum only you can know the reality.

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:19.560
And once all this becomes the reality it is a science,

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.600
and that's how it is made into science.

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:25.720
He showed so many of My photographs,

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:29.400
specially the one where lot of energy is coming out

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.560
of My Sahasrara when we are on a boat.

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:37.120
So he said, "She is the Source of all the cosmic energy."

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.920
And that's what is Adi Shakti is:

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.240
She's the one who creates everything.

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:51.640
The whole atmosphere that we know of is very artificial,

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:55.560
but when you understand what She has done ...

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:59.240
The first thing She does is to --

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.560
in My book also I have written down about it,

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.640
but I would like to tell you -- that Her first,

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:12.640
should say, manifestation is on the left-hand side.

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:16.680
That's the Mahakali's manifestation.

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:22.160
So She comes on the Mahakali system, the left-hand side,

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:26.960
and that is where She created Ganesha.

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:32.040
Shri Ganesha is created because His purity,

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:36.480
His innocence and auspiciousness,

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:41.600
this had to be created before She created the universe.

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:45.440
So first thing She does is to create Shri Ganesha,

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.760
and He's settled down.

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:51.520
Then She goes up, of course in the body of the Virata,

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:54.680
and then She goes round and goes up

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:58.000
on the right-hand side in the other way;

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:02.280
and there She creates all the universes --

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:04.920
as you call them, bhuvanas.

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:10.200
One universe -- there are fourteen bhuvanas -- means

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:15.480
these many, many universes make one bhuvana.

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:18.320
And She creates all these things

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:20.560
on the right-hand side.

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:25.160
Then She goes up and then She descends down,

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:27.440
creating all the chakras,

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:30.240
the Adi Chakras or the peethas.

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:33.400
She comes down, makes all these peethas

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:37.800
and then She's settled as the Kundalini.

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:42.640
But Adi Shakti is not fully the Kundalini, we can say,

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:46.200
Kundalini is, is a part of it.

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:50.160
The rest of the work is much more than this.

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:52.680
So the, all the, we call it the residual energy --

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:55.680
means after going through all this journey,

00:07:55.840 --> 00:08:00.400
then She comes round and She goes as Kundalini.

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:04.640
Because of this Kundalini and the chakras,

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:09.320
She creates a area which we call

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:13.720
as the chakras in the body.

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:17.400
Now first She creates these chakras in the head:

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:20.240
we call them the peethas of the chakras.

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:23.880
And then She comes down and creates these chakras,

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:28.680
which are in the body of the Virata.

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:30.920
Now once this has happened,

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:35.800
then She creates human beings, but not directly:

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:39.480
through the evolutionary process She goes through,

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:42.160
and that's how the evolution starts.

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:49.080
And then it starts developing from the minute,

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:53.280
small little microscopic organisms in the water,

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:57.360
and then it starts evolving.

00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:59.560
So when She creates water and

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:01.600
She creates all the universes,

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:05.080
She chooses this Mother Earth as the best place

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:07.840
to play Her evolutionary process,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.400
and there She makes this little microscopic thing.

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:14.640
Of course I have written all about it,

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:17.160
and when My book will be released

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:21.480
you can see that how first hydrogen,

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:24.960
carbon and oxygen and all of these things

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:28.240
were mixed up and how nitrogen comes into play,

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:31.400
and how a living process starts.

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:34.200
All this I have done it in My another book

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:35.920
that I am going to write now.

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:37.480
I mean, I have mostly finished,

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:40.240
but there's some more chakras are to be dealt with.

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:42.520
Now with this happening, you see,

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:45.240
one thing is there that whatever I write,

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:47.240
now people won't doubt.

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:49.480
They will know it's a scientific fact,

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:53.040
and that's what whatever I say is a fact.

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:55.560
Now to believe in the car...

00:09:55.720 --> 00:10:02.800
in the, even, a Mother, Adi Shakti, was impossible.

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:06.320
Specially you'll be amazed that Christian religion

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:09.760
somehow or other avoided the mentioning of the Mother.

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:12.880
Then the Islam, that also avoided

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:15.200
the mentioning of the Mother.

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:18.920
There's completely negation towards the Mother.

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:22.840
But only Indian philosophy had the Mother,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.400
and the Indians are actually Shakti-worshippers.

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:29.080
So this is how it was kept up

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:33.240
and brought to this position now,

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:39.440
that people have got, people have got full idea

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:45.480
as to Mother Principle that has worked out everything.

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:48.680
On this Mother Principle in India people are very sure

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:51.160
that it's the Mother who does everything,

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:55.760
and thus we have in India many, we should say,

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:58.960
many swayambus, means things

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:01.600
that are created of the Mother Earth.

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:04.400
For example, you know in Maharashtra

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:06.920
we have got Mahakali's place,

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:09.280
Mahasaraswati, Mahalakshmi,

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:14.440
and also we have got a place for the Adi Shakti.

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:16.640
Some people who have been to Nasik

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:19.960
must have seen Chaturshringi.

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:22.680
How many people have you been to Chaturshringi,

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:26.600
out of you? -- it's good.

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:33.360
So this Chaturshringi represents the Adi Shakti:

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:42.080
Adi Shakti which is the fourth dimension of this Power,

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:44.480
which gives you the ascent.

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:48.240
And ultimately through Mahalakshmi channel only,

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:50.400
you get your realization.

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:54.320
All this is a process,

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:59.000
all was created by the power of Adi Shakti.

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:01.760
It's a tremendous task.

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:05.120
The previous ones were not difficult,

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:09.920
because there for nature to create it was very easy.

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:13.000
The Mother Earth is one with the Adi Shakti,

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:16.040
the whole atmosphere is one with the Adi Shakti,

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:18.560
all the elements are one with the Adi Shakti,

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:22.160
so She could create all that without any difficulties.

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:26.960
But when human beings came, they got their freedom.

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:30.880
That's the only, I should say, the species

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:35.000
which fell into the maya of thinking

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:40.080
and of having the ego in them.

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:44.400
With this ego a maya worked on them, I should say,

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:48.520
and they forgot about the Principle

00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:51.480
that created this universe --

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:53.200
they took it for granted.

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:55.560
They felt that this is their own right

00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:58.800
that they are there, this is their own achievement

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:01.880
and they are the owners of everything.

00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:05.000
This started working in their minds so much

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:07.160
that they invaded other countries,

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:09.080
they destroyed so many people and

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:11.640
they never felt bad about it.

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:15.200
All their lives they have been thinking about aggressing others,

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:19.240
controlling others and doing all kinds of harmful things.

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:23.200
But they never even thought or

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:26.240
never did any introspection to see that

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:28.760
what we are doing is very, very wrong

00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:31.040
and it should not be done.

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:33.280
Because of the freedom they have,

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:35.480
there's such a turmoil in this world.

00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:39.320
And the people who were in charge of affairs,

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:43.360
they were very, very cruel and extremely --

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:48.160
had no feelings for the other people.

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:52.480
And this happened so many times in the, on this earth.

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:56.320
Now Sahaja Yoga has started.

00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:58.240
Once Sahaja Yoga has started,

00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:02.400
we have Sahaja yogis who are now receiving

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:06.120
the blessings of the Adi Shakti directly.

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:09.320
But still I must say, among Sahaja yogis also

00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:16.480
we don't have people whom I would call as very well-matured.

00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:19.760
They are Sahaja yogis, some of them, are just because

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:24.560
it's a fashion; maybe it should be better from their angle,

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:27.800
or from their selfish angle or whatever it is.

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:29.400
Is a very wrong thing.

00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:32.360
If you are in Sahaja Yoga you must know now

00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:36.480
you are responsible for the whole world.

00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:40.200
You are the only people who have come forward,

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:43.720
you are the only people who have achieved something.

00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:45.960
And then at this juncture

00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:48.600
you should behave in a manner that,

00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:53.440
that behooves a big saint or a realized soul;

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:57.120
but sometimes you find them behaving in such a manner,

00:14:57.280 --> 00:14:59.160
is shocking sometimes.

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:03.200
They have no respect for themselves or for others,

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:06.400
and their whole attitude is very funny.

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:10.400
Some of them are money-oriented, some of them are power-oriented.

00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:13.640
And those who are power-oriented are more dangerous, I think,

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:15.320
than money-oriented;

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:17.760
because those who are power-oriented

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:22.920
try to bring such bad name to Sahaja Yoga.

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:27.800
They are very insulting, dominating and horrible people.

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:33.000
Their whole attitude is to achieve power in Sahaja Yoga,

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:36.200
and they try all tricks to achieve that power.

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:39.520
But for some time they, they look all right --

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:41.400
after some time you'll find

00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:44.960
they'll all disappear from the field of Sahaja Yoga.

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:48.080
It's a very big cleansing process going on.

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:53.120
You must understand that you have come in the,

00:15:53.280 --> 00:16:01.000
in the field of very high consciousness

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:04.800
where you are in contact with the Divine.

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:09.080
Now here if you behave like ordinary people

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:11.400
who have no divinity within them,

00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:13.960
how long will you continue like this?

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:19.080
So this is very important that you should try to meditate

00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:20.920
and evolve yourselves,

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:25.000
and become really very good Sahaja yogis.

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:28.040
In some places we are very, very lucky.

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:31.280
In some, some countries we are very, very lucky.

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:35.920
But in some countries I find the people are just deaf and dumb.

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:38.880
They can't understand Sahaja Yoga.

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:40.720
For My program they do come,

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:43.080
and afterwards just they disappear.

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:46.120
This one I think is also --

00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:48.720
Sahaja yogis are responsible for this.

00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:50.440
The way they go about,

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:56.400
the way they want to do Sahaj work is not Sahaj.

00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:59.800
Must be something definitely wrong with the whole thing,

00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:04.160
and that's why it's not working out the same way

00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:07.000
as it is working out in many places.

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:11.240
So I have to tell you that all this is there,

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:13.200
that Adi Shakti is there,

00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:15.840
and all this has happened through Adi Shakti.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.160
But now the further work has to be done

00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:22.040
through you people because you are the channels,

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:26.160
you are the one who have to transform people.

00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:29.240
Now everybody should understand and know

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:34.880
how many people we have given realization.

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:37.200
We have to think about it:

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:40.160
what have we done for Sahaja Yoga?

00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:43.760
Once I was traveling by plane and I saw it was so --

00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:46.280
met a lady who was sitting next to Me,

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:48.960
and she was so hot, I couldn't understand.

00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:52.240
Then she told me she is a disciple of a guru

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:54.840
and very proud of it, and she started telling Me

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.640
all about him and things.

00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:58.920
I was amazed, that look at this woman,

00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:02.040
she hasn't got anything from him and she was just saying,

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:04.000
"I have given so much money to him,

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:06.520
I have done this thing to him," and all those things.

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:09.240
But she had nothing, and despite that

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:11.320
she was talking to Me,

00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:14.080
a stranger person, about the guru.

00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:17.600
But in Sahaja Yoga I've seen people are rather shy.

00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:21.400
They don't want to talk about Sahaja Yoga openly to others,

00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:24.600
which is a very wrong thing you are doing because

00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:27.080
you are responsible for this work.

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:28.920
You have been given realization --

00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:31.880
of course you were seeking, everything is all right --

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:36.400
but all of you must try to give realizations to others.

00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:41.280
I must say that somehow men have been more dynamic

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:42.640
and working it out.

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:45.680
The women in Sahaja Yoga are not yet coming up

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:47.600
to that level as they should.

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:50.360
They have to be more sensible about it,

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:52.040
and they have to work it out.

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:54.760
They can do it, but only trouble is, I think

00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:58.560
they have certain minor problems

00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:00.280
about which they are worried.

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:03.720
Always I get letters from ladies saying this is wrong,

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:07.720
that is wrong, complaining all the time;

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:10.240
when I'm so fed up of their letters now that

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:14.600
I think they're useless to read them also.

00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:17.800
So I have to tell you all that it is important

00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:21.240
that men because they are dynamic,

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:23.160
women should be much more,

00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:27.600
because they are shakti and I am a woman.

00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:32.760
So I find that the men are more sort of active

00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:34.920
and dynamic about Sahaja Yoga,

00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:38.160
and I don't know what is the reason why women are not.

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:43.560
They can transform so many people.

00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:46.000
They can do so much good to others.

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:50.720
They can bring so much love and compassion,

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:53.240
because this love and compassion

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:57.080
is a quality of a mother, of a woman.

00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:00.000
And if the women don't have that quality,

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:02.080
it's useless to be a woman.

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:07.000
All the time if you are busy about your

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:11.040
useless things like fashions or faces and all that,

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:13.480
then the time is all wasted.

00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:16.840
You have a short time now, you've got your realization

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.800
and you must decide what have you done so far,

00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:22.680
what have you achieved for so far.

00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:26.440
But I would say that also in Sahaja Yoga I've found

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:30.400
there are all kinds of funny ideas growing here.

00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:33.080
Like certain rituals they'll take up.

00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:35.440
Then they prescribe certain rituals,

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:36.840
they'll talk about it,

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.160
and kind of a power-orientation is there.

00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:42.360
They want to oppress others,

00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:45.800
and they want to take over and frighten people

00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:48.760
and behave in such a manner that,

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:52.040
as if they are very good.

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:54.280
Some of them start saying that

00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:58.040
"Mataji said so. This is Mataji's ideas."

00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:02.800
By their own power-orientation

00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:05.800
they manufacture things and talk like that and ...

00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:07.240
But ask them,

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:09.520
"How many have you given realization?"

00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:13.640
The first thing is, you must determine is positivity:

00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:16.000
how many you have given realization?

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:20.040
Is just talking about others, criticizing others,

00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:24.680
talking about the defects of Sahaja Yoga,

00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:27.000
seeing in the Sahaja yogis;

00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:30.720
is I would say, is still a very preliminary things

00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:34.920
that have happened before, and it should stop now.

00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:38.240
Now as it is, once this book is out,

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:42.400
all over the world, it will be known about our work;

00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:44.360
we'll be not challenged any more.

00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:49.800
But still we have to see for ourselves that

00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:55.480
if we have achieved this kind of recognition

00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:57.640
then we should be up to that,

00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:00.160
our capability should be up to that.

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:02.680
We should not be lagging behind.

00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:08.240
For example, if you ask some Sahaja yogis,

00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:09.960
specially Sahaja yoginis,

00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:12.040
they don't know much about Sahaja Yoga,

00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:13.960
they don't know about chakras,

00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:16.760
they don't know anything about the deities;

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:20.440
nothing they know -- how can they be Sahaja yogis?

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:22.600
You have to know all about it.

00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:25.720
Only thing that you don't realize,

00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:29.880
that it's not outside that you are a Sahaja yogi

00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:31.680
but it is inside.

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:36.200
Inside you have to have that kind of an understanding

00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:42.080
of the chakras and of Sahaja Yoga, how it works,

00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:43.600
how it helps you.

00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:48.280
Now supposing if I'm the Source of that energy,

00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:50.560
which you know very well I am,

00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:53.880
then you achieve yours also,

00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:58.440
a kind of a perfection about dealing with people

00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:00.880
and bringing them to Sahaja Yoga.

00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:03.400
Is a very important work you have to do,

00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:08.480
is to bring Sahaja yogis in Sahaja Yoga.

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:13.760
What I find that some people are very much still lagging behind,

00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:20.240
and it's very surprising that they live in that country,

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:22.400
they are part and parcel of that country

00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:24.160
and they are not bothered.

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:26.920
Under these circumstances they'll be blamed,

00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:31.480
that "Why didn't you do? Why didn't you find out

00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:36.560
the ways and methods of convincing at least your countrymen?"

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:41.440
So Sahaja Yoga at the brink of growth

00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:44.560
cannot grow only with one country or two countries;

00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:49.200
all the countries have to be brought into Sahaja Yoga.

00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:55.920
All the people that we could call into Sahaja Yoga

00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:57.680
will be a very good idea.

00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:00.400
And then we have books to convince people,

00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:03.480
we have to talk to them about it.

00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:07.160
But what I find about Sahaja yogis,

00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:09.480
that once they start spreading Sahaja Yoga also

00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:12.520
their ego comes up, and this thing --

00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:15.280
they are very great Sahaja yogis, they are great leaders --

00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:17.640
all this kind of stupid ideas

00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:20.760
walk into their heads, which is wrong.

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:24.200
You have to just think in a very humble manner.

00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:27.720
The more you have, the more you become humble,

00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:32.080
like a tree when laden with fruits, it bends down.

00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:35.720
In the same way you have to be very humble.

00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:40.000
But that humility is sometimes very difficult,

00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:43.400
because the culture of the West is not humble culture --

00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:49.800
it's a culture of aggression, culture of domination.

00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:52.160
So far they have been, they think because of

00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:55.240
domination they could go all over the world,

00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:57.080
they could achieve so many things.

00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:59.440
What have they achieved? Nothing.

00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:01.360
In their own countries if you see,

00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:03.160
there's drug addiction.

00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:05.680
Why should people take to drugs so much?

00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:08.320
Then all kinds of sinful things they do

00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:10.320
which I don't want to mention,

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:13.720
but you know what they are doing -- which in India,

00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:17.040
which is a poorer country, one cannot even think of.

00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:20.160
Such things are happening around you,

00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:22.720
so find out what's wrong where

00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:25.800
and how you can correct these things,

00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:27.800
if you can help them.

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:29.800
Actually now, as I told you,

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.840
I am going to start some sort of organizations

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.920
that will do good to human beings.

00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:36.880
But you all can join also.

00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:40.960
You can also start in your own countries something like that.

00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:46.320
But first you have to get rid of your ego.

00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:48.760
See, that once happens to you,

00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:51.800
then only your attention would be steady.

00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:54.480
And this ego is very simple for you

00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:58.040
because you worship Christ, and the Christ is the one

00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:01.680
who was settled on the Agnya chakra.

00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:03.320
You all worship Christ,

00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:06.000
but that humility of Christ is not there --

00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:07.840
just the opposite of it.

00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:09.840
It has happened everywhere that

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:11.880
whatever is preached in the religion,

00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:14.160
people did just the opposite of it.

00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:16.160
For example Hindu religion,

00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:18.400
I would say Hindu philosophy is that

00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:21.920
in everybody resides the spirit.

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:24.560
Now in everybody if there is spirit,

00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:27.200
then how can you have different caste systems,

00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:31.000
and how can you have somebody higher and lower?

00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:34.280
Other way round, now Christ has said

00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:37.080
that you have to forgive, forgive everyone,

00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:39.280
and you have to humble down.

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:41.600
And that's what one finds,

00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:45.400
that among Christians they don't know humility,

00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:47.480
they have no idea of humility.

00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:50.000
Men are like that, women are like that,

00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:52.600
and the men and women then go on fighting.

00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:55.240
There's no question of anybody being humble,

00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:57.080
peaceful and all that.

00:26:57.240 --> 00:27:00.760
So it's very artificially they are showing off

00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:03.080
that they are very philanthropist and all that,

00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:07.080
but inside in their heart I don't find there is any love,

00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:10.400
there's any compassion in the real sense of the word.

00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:12.680
So when we are dealing with reality,

00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:15.880
we have to know that we cannot just go on

00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:18.560
with things which are artificial,

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:21.080
which are befooling others,

00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:23.240
but we have to really become that.

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:27.280
Once if you become that, when you are really like that,

00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:34.560
then only you have done the job for which you are born

00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:37.520
at this juncture of blossom-times.

00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:41.240
Otherwise you could have been born earlier

00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:44.000
and could have been something different.

00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:47.640
But you are specially born so you realize your value,

00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:52.400
realize yourself what you are and try to understand,

00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:55.560
have a self-respect, and try to do things

00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:59.000
which are very important as Sahaja yogis.

00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:01.320
Of course you are doing a job,

00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:03.400
you are doing other things;

00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:06.760
but you'll be amazed, if you do work of Sahaja Yoga

00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:09.320
you will find more time for everything.

00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:13.040
Once you start doing God's work, God does your work.

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:15.560
And that's how you'll be amazed

00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:18.760
how you get so much time to do the right thing.

00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:24.040
Now it is for you to go back and introspect,

00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:25.560
see for yourself.

00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:28.640
Now the Adi Shakti Herself has come.

00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:32.400
But I'm very simple, I'm very simple to look at;

00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:36.440
in My behavior I'm very, very humble,

00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:39.160
and people take Me for granted.

00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:41.560
I don't do anything. I don't want to punish you,

00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:43.040
I don't want to do anything like that.

00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:44.840
But you yourself get punished,

00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:46.840
you yourself become useless

00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:51.120
if you do not look after yourself and grow yourself.

00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:53.680
This finding is so great,

00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:56.960
and this man had never known Me before.

00:28:57.120 --> 00:29:00.160
He's very learned but he's very humble,

00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:02.800
and what he told Me that

00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:07.800
"Just imagine, I'm sitting before the Creator of this world

00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:10.360
and still I'm very normal."

00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:12.880
So I said, "What should happen to you, what do you think?"

00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:15.560
So he said, "Mother, it's a big thing to realize

00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:17.440
that I am sitting before You,

00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:19.400
and that You are here."

00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:23.760
I said, "It's good that you don't feel My presence

00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:30.000
so oppressive or so dominating. I'm very happy."

00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:32.240
"No," he says, "I just feel the love,

00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:36.040
just feel the compassion, that's what it is."

00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:38.080
We have to know that we should have

00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:40.560
just love and compassion;

00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:43.880
compassion and love for ourselves

00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:48.000
in the way that we should not harm anybody's heart.

00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:53.160
To say something to hurt someone is very sinful.

00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:55.520
But some people enjoy that very much,

00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:57.520
they think they are very clever -- it's not so.

00:29:57.680 --> 00:30:01.320
When you talk to someone you must say something

00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:04.840
which is very soothing and good.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.240
Another thing is the temper of a person, is a temper --

00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:10.360
that a slightest thing here and there,

00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:12.280
they get into tempers.

00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:16.240
Now this has to be told, this temper, that "You keep quiet.

00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:17.840
I have nothing to do with you."

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.040
That is one thing.

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:22.720
Then there are people who are very subtly,

00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:26.720
I should say, power-oriented, very subtle.

00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:30.880
They have tricks and trades by which they know how to control others.

00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:33.840
What are you going to gain out of it?

00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:35.320
What is your gain?

00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:37.640
By doing all these things what will happen?

00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:42.240
In these worldly things you might be little bit popular,

00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:46.280
little bit having a position or something;

00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:50.040
but what is it, after all? That is not going to help you.

00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:52.240
What is going to help you the most is

00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:55.960
to make yourself a perfect channel for Sahaja Yoga,

00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:58.120
to be a perfect channel.

00:30:58.280 --> 00:31:03.600
In that you will be amazed how you'll be helped.

00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:06.560
So I would say for you people who are in the West,

00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:09.680
I would say you must develop humility.

00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:11.080
It's very important.

00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:13.480
I was surprised, in Russia itself

00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:17.080
the people are not only humble, but such dedication,

00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:20.880
such dedication -- unbelievable!

00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:23.120
They don't even raise their eyes to Me.

00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:25.440
I don't know how they got this idea.

00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:29.040
This is not after the discovery, but even before that.

00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:34.160
They were so nice and so humble and so full of love;

00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:38.240
and even the children brought Me small, small presents, you know,

00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:41.080
just to give Me, so sweetly.

00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:45.080
This is something surprising how these people in Russia

00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:48.920
have achieved that capability to become.

00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:53.280
And I think in the West, Russia is the country

00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:57.480
which will achieve a very great height in spirituality,

00:31:57.640 --> 00:32:00.560
and that means they'll be the most powerful people.

00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:03.480
Let us see what you are doing in your own country

00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:05.840
and how you are going to work it out.

00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:09.840
See, there are so many things you can do very easily,

00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:14.480
if you see for yourself that you are the instrument of the Divine.

00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:17.560
And then your temperament will change,

00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:21.800
the nature will change; you'll become a very, very

00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:25.160
sweet person, likable person,

00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:30.680
and everybody will think that this is a saint walking around.

00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:33.000
So that's all I have to say about this.

00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:36.760
Whatever is the discovery is not a discovery for Me,

00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:38.840
but discovery for the whole world.

00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:43.840
And I'm sure once it is established

00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:47.560
and is exposed to the whole world,

00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:50.936
things will change for you, and for Me also.

00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:53.600
May God bless you.
