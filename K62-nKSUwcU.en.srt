1
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:15,081
Today is the happiest day for all of you,
for the whole universe, because Shri Ganesha

2
00:00:15,081 --> 00:00:16,821
was created.

3
00:00:16,821 --> 00:00:30,401
He was created to emit auspiciousness through
His Chaitanya [- Divine Vibrations –ed.].

4
00:00:30,401 --> 00:00:39,670
First, the whole cosmos was filled with this
Chaitanyasrishti [- creation of Divine Vibrations

5
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:40,670
–ed.].

6
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:49,330
Then Brahmadeva came into play, and He created
all the matter.

7
00:00:49,330 --> 00:01:06,261
But

8
00:01:06,261 --> 00:01:27,461
the greatest blessings of the Divine Power
was to symbolize Chaitanya, and this Chaitanya

9
00:01:27,461 --> 00:01:37,081
has many aspects, but specially in Shri Ganesha,
it is auspiciousness.

10
00:01:37,081 --> 00:01:43,971
In these modern times people have lost the
sense of auspiciousness.

11
00:01:43,971 --> 00:01:51,491
Everything that emits vibrations, Chaitanya,
is auspicious, is shubh, and whatever does

12
00:01:51,491 --> 00:01:58,161
not is not by any chance auspicious.

13
00:01:58,161 --> 00:02:07,781
So first of all, whatever you worship, whatever
you accept, all of them have to be auspicious

14
00:02:07,781 --> 00:02:09,601
things.

15
00:02:09,601 --> 00:02:18,980
Every shape has a coefficience and all these
shapes which you see, not necessarily give

16
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,870
vibrations.

17
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:28,831
But in the human beings also, we find there
are many people, like you, who have Chaitanya

18
00:02:28,831 --> 00:02:30,700
flowing in them.

19
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:38,150
But this Chaitanya when it flows, we just
take Shri Ganesha for granted.

20
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:43,411
We do not understand that we have to awaken
Shri Ganesha within us.

21
00:02:43,411 --> 00:02:44,411
Means what?

22
00:02:44,411 --> 00:02:46,501
What we have to do?

23
00:02:46,501 --> 00:02:55,461
There is Shri Ganesha already existing in
you and as I said that innocence cannot be

24
00:02:55,461 --> 00:03:03,281
lost, so Shri Ganesha is eternal being, eternal
child – He cannot be lost and He cannot

25
00:03:03,281 --> 00:03:04,941
be destroyed.

26
00:03:04,941 --> 00:03:07,170
So He’s all the time there.

27
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:21,210
Maybe some clouds of your ill doings are covering
the great personality of innocence.

28
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:27,120
But it is always there present.

29
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:35,420
So now, what should we do to keep this Ganesha
all the time shining within us?

30
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:44,680
Is to first remember that you were made in
the same pattern as Shri Ganesh.

31
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:54,221
But His Kundalini is on His stomach; His pure
desire is on His stomach.

32
00:03:54,221 --> 00:04:06,751
It’s very significant to understand why
it is there that His Kundalini is on His stomach.

33
00:04:06,751 --> 00:04:18,931
That means He does not have to conquer the
temptations of Mooladhara at all.

34
00:04:18,931 --> 00:04:28,161
But He has His Kundalini on His stomach, that
means He is also beyond the temptations of

35
00:04:28,161 --> 00:04:47,061
food, of power or anything because His stomach
represents absolute abandonment, absolute

36
00:04:47,061 --> 00:04:48,241
freedom.

37
00:04:48,241 --> 00:04:55,561
He’s not bothered as to how He looks that…
these days there is a big fashion that you

38
00:04:55,561 --> 00:04:56,681
cannot have a big belly.

39
00:04:56,681 --> 00:05:05,071
I mean this is becoming a big… not only
fashion but a big business.

40
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:08,201
But as age grows, you have to have it.

41
00:05:08,201 --> 00:05:15,331
Even small children have that and they look
so sweet.

42
00:05:15,331 --> 00:05:23,191
Those people who are very thin must understand
that they might be getting some prizes in

43
00:05:23,191 --> 00:05:38,321
the… maybe beauty contest or something,
but they do not have that majesty, that royalty,

44
00:05:38,321 --> 00:05:43,001
that dignity in them as they should have.

45
00:05:43,001 --> 00:05:46,601
So Shri Ganesha accepts everything.

46
00:05:46,601 --> 00:05:53,371
He has a head with a trunk.

47
00:05:53,371 --> 00:05:55,941
He accepts it.

48
00:05:55,941 --> 00:05:59,211
Of course, is important, He should have that.

49
00:05:59,211 --> 00:06:05,161
Because head of the elephant suggests that
He is not like a human being who develops

50
00:06:05,161 --> 00:06:14,991
ego, superego, conditionings, but He is just
all the time one with the Divine.

51
00:06:14,991 --> 00:06:21,431
He accepts His body, He accepts His head,
He accepts His ears, He accepts everything

52
00:06:21,431 --> 00:06:24,501
that He is made of.

53
00:06:24,501 --> 00:06:32,871
He doesn’t aspire to something – some
entrepreneurs put some ideas and He wouldn’t

54
00:06:32,871 --> 00:06:34,811
go run after them.

55
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:43,571
He won’t try to change Himself; He won’t
try to create that fashion and all that.

56
00:06:43,571 --> 00:06:56,371
He is what He is… because He is a satisfied
soul.

57
00:06:56,371 --> 00:07:09,971
The Kundalini on the stomach shows a complete,
self-contented, satisfied personality of Shri

58
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:11,941
Ganesha.

59
00:07:11,941 --> 00:07:22,551
When you have all the powers within you, you
know you are powerful, then you don’t hanker

60
00:07:22,551 --> 00:07:32,741
after all these things and you don’t try
to make a position or an impression of others.

61
00:07:32,741 --> 00:07:41,891
For example, He would never go and read books
like how to impress people.

62
00:07:41,891 --> 00:07:47,611
Very common.

63
00:07:47,611 --> 00:07:56,191
So now, as you are created in the same image
of Shri Ganesh, you have to understand that

64
00:07:56,191 --> 00:08:04,451
you have to accept whatever God has given
you, whatever position He has given you.

65
00:08:04,451 --> 00:08:05,941
Same with Christ.

66
00:08:05,941 --> 00:08:11,181
Christ accepted His father who was just a
carpenter.

67
00:08:11,181 --> 00:08:17,721
He didn’t aspire for something higher or
some sort of a special position or a power

68
00:08:17,721 --> 00:08:28,211
because He was so powerful – what more power
can He have?

69
00:08:28,211 --> 00:08:35,261
Though people mocked at Him and laughed at
Him and could not accept what He was saying,

70
00:08:35,261 --> 00:08:42,671
but still He was self-contented, self-satisfied.

71
00:08:42,671 --> 00:08:44,791
He knew what it was.

72
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:55,341
So, for a Sahaja Yogi first thing is to be
self-contented.

73
00:08:55,341 --> 00:09:05,971
As I told you, the fundamentals of the western
life is to see and to be seen.

74
00:09:05,971 --> 00:09:16,981
Both things were missing completely in the
incarnation of Shri Ganesh.

75
00:09:16,981 --> 00:09:22,421
So when I say these things, suddenly people
start thinking, “Let us become hippies,

76
00:09:22,421 --> 00:09:27,651
or let them become punks, or let us become
this, let us become that.”

77
00:09:27,651 --> 00:09:29,591
You don’t have to become anything.

78
00:09:29,591 --> 00:09:36,801
Whatever you have – your body, your face,
your hair – everything is there, just meant

79
00:09:36,801 --> 00:09:42,031
for you.

80
00:09:42,031 --> 00:09:56,661
You don’t have to change anything outwardly
because inside is complete Chaitanya.

81
00:09:56,661 --> 00:10:02,801
Shri Ganesha never tried to change Himself.

82
00:10:02,801 --> 00:10:17,911
Though there were so many clouds on His being,
though many people insulted Him, tortured

83
00:10:17,911 --> 00:10:27,891
Him, hanged Him, crucified Him, still the
Eternal Being didn’t bother.

84
00:10:27,891 --> 00:10:41,391
So the first and foremost thing for a Sahaja
Yogi is to accept, go on accepting things.

85
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:46,571
But when I say accept, I must say the other
side also: that doesn’t mean you start accepting

86
00:10:46,571 --> 00:10:51,251
bhoots, all the bad qualities of others.

87
00:10:51,251 --> 00:10:57,431
“Mother, You said you must accept”, so
they’ll start accepting all these bad qualities.

88
00:10:57,431 --> 00:10:58,751
“What’s wrong?

89
00:10:58,751 --> 00:11:01,481
You have said it already.”

90
00:11:01,481 --> 00:11:05,901
Whatever I say has another side, always.

91
00:11:05,901 --> 00:11:10,101
Like I said, “Now you have become your own
Guru.”

92
00:11:10,101 --> 00:11:13,841
So, “Why should we listen to anybody else?”

93
00:11:13,841 --> 00:11:30,501
Like this, you see, we go on diverting ourselves,
deviating ourselves from reality just to cheat

94
00:11:30,501 --> 00:11:32,661
ourselves.

95
00:11:32,661 --> 00:11:37,831
And this comes because we have no wisdom.

96
00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:44,211
We have no wisdom because we do not know what
is for our benevolence, what is for our good,

97
00:11:44,211 --> 00:11:45,781
what we should do for our good.

98
00:11:45,781 --> 00:11:49,711
I mean even if we know, we don’t want to
do it.

99
00:11:49,711 --> 00:11:53,001
So, what we lack is wisdom.

100
00:11:53,001 --> 00:11:58,430
That’s a vicious circle, I must say, that
Ganesha is to be awakened to give you wisdom

101
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:08,961
– He is the giver of wisdom, He is the giver
of wisdom – and He has to give you the wisdom,

102
00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:14,111
He is to be awakened; but you are not wise
because He is not awakened.

103
00:12:14,111 --> 00:12:19,880
It’s a very vicious circle.

104
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:23,421
How to make this vicious circle break?

105
00:12:23,421 --> 00:12:29,851
That “Let my wisdom shine in my attention.

106
00:12:29,851 --> 00:12:38,741
Let Shri Ganesha throw His light in my attention.”

107
00:12:38,741 --> 00:12:44,481
Mentally you people are very alert, no doubt.

108
00:12:44,481 --> 00:12:54,071
And you can always cheat yourself nicely.

109
00:12:54,071 --> 00:13:05,911
That’s the point where you could see yourself
– introspection, which I have seen among

110
00:13:05,911 --> 00:13:10,211
Russians.

111
00:13:10,211 --> 00:13:14,521
Just introspect: “Why do I do like that?

112
00:13:14,521 --> 00:13:17,630
Why cannot I meditate?

113
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:23,431
Am I going to miss out?

114
00:13:23,431 --> 00:13:31,851
Why can I not do something that is good for
me?”

115
00:13:31,851 --> 00:13:41,991
Introspection is the only way you can see
yourself how far you are from Shri Ganesh.

116
00:13:41,991 --> 00:13:53,851
Even, I have seen, when I say something in
general, people always – the mind is very

117
00:13:53,851 --> 00:13:59,431
clever – thinks that I am talking about
somebody else, not about them.

118
00:13:59,431 --> 00:14:08,151
It’s a convex mind, convex, which never
receives anything inside itself because there

119
00:14:08,151 --> 00:14:13,551
is no wisdom.

120
00:14:13,551 --> 00:14:24,101
If you are wise, then not only that you’ll
accept but you’ll understand and it will

121
00:14:24,101 --> 00:14:29,941
penetrate into your attention through your
central nervous system.

122
00:14:29,941 --> 00:14:33,581
You just know that this is it.

123
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:41,402
Now you know that this… you put your hand
towards this candle, it… you’ll… your

124
00:14:41,402 --> 00:14:42,531
fingers might burn.

125
00:14:42,531 --> 00:14:48,491
You know it definitely, with experience, and
you won’t do that.

126
00:14:48,491 --> 00:14:56,901
With experience you have learnt not to put
your hand on to the candle.

127
00:14:56,901 --> 00:15:02,571
And this wisdom is there, I don’t have to
tell you that.

128
00:15:02,571 --> 00:15:06,471
But this is a new life you have started – a
spiritual life.

129
00:15:06,471 --> 00:15:15,271
When you are going into the spiritual life,
try to remember your experiences, one after

130
00:15:15,271 --> 00:15:20,831
another: how you got transformed, how you
changed, how many the bad things that you

131
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:25,851
had disappeared gradually and how you have
become so nice.

132
00:15:25,851 --> 00:15:34,571
This will take away your depression – to
begin with.

133
00:15:34,571 --> 00:15:38,981
Then you should think that, “What do I have
to do further?

134
00:15:38,981 --> 00:15:40,241
Am I really wise, or I’m stupid?”

135
00:15:40,241 --> 00:15:50,391
There are lots of stages between absolute
stupidity and absolute wisdom, and you see

136
00:15:50,391 --> 00:16:01,031
all those shades all over, and combinations
and permutations of these I see every day.

137
00:16:01,031 --> 00:16:12,621
And I am surprised that after getting your
Self Realization, when Shri Ganesha is shining

138
00:16:12,621 --> 00:16:20,861
in your attention, you should see your reflection
clearly and try to correct it.

139
00:16:20,861 --> 00:16:29,861
Only this much wisdom if you have that, “I
have to work out my benevolence”, you’ll

140
00:16:29,861 --> 00:16:32,940
do it.

141
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:39,130
I know of somebody who would never get up
in the mornings, say for example.

142
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:44,571
But one day I saw him ready at about six o’clock
in the morning – I was surprised.

143
00:16:44,571 --> 00:16:50,050
How this gentleman who has no self-discipline
has suddenly got up at six o’clock and ready

144
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,751
to go somewhere.

145
00:16:51,751 --> 00:16:55,881
I said, “Where are you going?”

146
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:58,281
“You don’t know?”

147
00:16:58,281 --> 00:16:59,281
I said, “What?”

148
00:16:59,281 --> 00:17:06,190
“I have got a job now and I have to be present
at 8 o’clock and it will take two hours

149
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:07,391
to reach that place.

150
00:17:07,391 --> 00:17:09,410
Also, I am keeping some margin.

151
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:10,951
So I have to leave now.

152
00:17:10,951 --> 00:17:13,101
I can’t talk to You even.”

153
00:17:13,101 --> 00:17:17,711
Quite alert, awake.

154
00:17:17,711 --> 00:17:27,341
Now, what is the thing is as far as money
is concerned, lot of wisdom is there.

155
00:17:27,341 --> 00:17:35,191
Don’t have to tell them, that is automatically.

156
00:17:35,191 --> 00:17:46,321
Money wisdom is quite a lot, job wisdom is
quite a lot.

157
00:17:46,321 --> 00:17:58,491
Because these things means prestige in the
society, this means security in the society.

158
00:17:58,491 --> 00:18:04,871
So this kind of business you find in many
people and in some even that is missing.

159
00:18:04,871 --> 00:18:10,291
They don’t even understand that they have
to earn their living.

160
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:20,211
But that’s the minimum, you cannot be parasite.

161
00:18:20,211 --> 00:18:26,451
Then the second stage, as I said by many stages,
is this: that we are not for money, money

162
00:18:26,451 --> 00:18:36,091
is for us.

163
00:18:36,091 --> 00:18:48,871
The attention if it is on your Spirit, on
the Ganesha Principle, then whole situation

164
00:18:48,871 --> 00:18:51,681
will change.

165
00:18:51,681 --> 00:18:57,301
Your priorities will change.

166
00:18:57,301 --> 00:19:01,531
And suddenly people will say, “Mother, what
has happened to this gentleman?

167
00:19:01,531 --> 00:19:13,081
He was a stupid fool, now he has become such
a wise person.”

168
00:19:13,081 --> 00:19:18,081
So to awaken Shri Ganesha you should have
minimum wisdom already there.

169
00:19:18,081 --> 00:19:22,611
I mean, even if that is not there, how can
you work it out?

170
00:19:22,611 --> 00:19:31,561
Is not meant for stupid people, Moodhas, not
meant for Moodh.

171
00:19:31,561 --> 00:19:34,531
So now what is our benevolence is?

172
00:19:34,531 --> 00:19:39,531
Let us see.

173
00:19:39,531 --> 00:19:41,361
Is it money?

174
00:19:41,361 --> 00:19:42,951
No.

175
00:19:42,951 --> 00:19:50,831
Those who have money don’t seem to be very
happy people always.

176
00:19:50,831 --> 00:19:52,501
Then what is the next, is jobs?

177
00:19:52,501 --> 00:19:57,831
Those who have jobs – all right, should
have jobs, I am not saying you should be jobless.

178
00:19:57,831 --> 00:20:05,371
I mean immediately the another side they will
take, I mean so quick you know, that, “Mother

179
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:13,361
is saying we can be jobless you see, nice.”

180
00:20:13,361 --> 00:20:15,141
Immediate, escapes.

181
00:20:15,141 --> 00:20:23,001
Now, then the power: you want to have political
power, this social power, this power, that

182
00:20:23,001 --> 00:20:29,821
power – is absolutely a joyless pursuit.

183
00:20:29,821 --> 00:20:37,811
You go and see those people who are supposed
to be powerful, so called, half way they are

184
00:20:37,811 --> 00:20:48,400
towards hell, one foot there and one foot
here and about to be gulped down by the crocodiles.

185
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:54,520
You can see it clearly.

186
00:20:54,520 --> 00:21:00,650
Specially in this Kali Yuga it’s so obvious,
so clear-cut.

187
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:08,851
We don’t want to be like them, we want to
be like Shri Ganesh.

188
00:21:08,851 --> 00:21:14,871
So once you start accepting your circumstances,
accepting your body, your… accepting your

189
00:21:14,871 --> 00:21:33,030
face, everything, you will see that lot of
time will be saved.

190
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:43,371
Another problem that faces us is planning.

191
00:21:43,371 --> 00:21:46,791
And that is missing in Shri Ganesha completely.

192
00:21:46,791 --> 00:21:49,401
He did not do any planning whatsoever.

193
00:21:49,401 --> 00:21:56,601
I wish He had done some planning, things would
have been much better.

194
00:21:56,601 --> 00:22:03,351
He doesn’t believe in planning because He
is so powerful.

195
00:22:03,351 --> 00:22:07,811
Whatever He wants, He can get it done.

196
00:22:07,811 --> 00:22:08,811
You want the sun?

197
00:22:08,811 --> 00:22:10,891
All right the sun is there.

198
00:22:10,891 --> 00:22:11,891
You want the moon?

199
00:22:11,891 --> 00:22:12,891
Moon is there.

200
00:22:12,891 --> 00:22:13,891
You want the stars?

201
00:22:13,891 --> 00:22:14,891
Stars is there.

202
00:22:14,891 --> 00:22:26,381
The
dust of His feet can create the whole universe

203
00:22:26,381 --> 00:22:32,071
– universes after universes.

204
00:22:32,071 --> 00:22:44,071
For such a person, there is no need to be
planning everything because whatever He wants

205
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:47,081
happens.

206
00:22:47,081 --> 00:22:50,131
But why, why it happens?

207
00:22:50,131 --> 00:22:54,841
Why He has this power?

208
00:22:54,841 --> 00:22:59,160
Because He is in that state.

209
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:07,671
Are you in that state?

210
00:23:07,671 --> 00:23:10,641
You have not achieved that state.

211
00:23:10,641 --> 00:23:21,351
You talk somebody… tell somebody that, “Oh
my, I have to go and catch the plane.”

212
00:23:21,351 --> 00:23:26,751
There are ten people standing next to you,
they’ll all get panicky.

213
00:23:26,751 --> 00:23:33,900
I have to go, and they are bothered; something
sort of goes off their heads.

214
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:37,780
I don’t know what goes, they go amuck.

215
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:39,231
I never tell them like that.

216
00:23:39,231 --> 00:23:44,661
I say, “There’s still time for the plane
to go, and don’t worry.

217
00:23:44,661 --> 00:23:53,511
When I reach there then the plane will leave
so you don’t worry.”

218
00:23:53,511 --> 00:24:06,821
But because of this kind of a… presumptions,
and the planning system of the mind, you just

219
00:24:06,821 --> 00:24:11,821
think that, “Now I have a plan to go today,
I must go.”

220
00:24:11,821 --> 00:24:12,821
Why?

221
00:24:12,821 --> 00:24:15,111
I won’t go.

222
00:24:15,111 --> 00:24:17,701
I may decide at the last minute I don’t
want to go.

223
00:24:17,701 --> 00:24:20,151
I’ll make the plane go away.

224
00:24:20,151 --> 00:24:25,201
We did that many a times, you know very well.

225
00:24:25,201 --> 00:24:33,011
I wanted to buy the Rome Ashram, so I saw
to it that the plane never arrived.

226
00:24:33,011 --> 00:24:38,011
But you have to be in that state.

227
00:24:38,011 --> 00:24:41,241
Specially buying this Cabella, you know what
happened.

228
00:24:41,241 --> 00:24:49,311
There were five great intellectuals on My
head sitting.

229
00:24:49,311 --> 00:24:54,201
I didn’t know how I will manage these five
intellectuals with all their planning, this,

230
00:24:54,201 --> 00:25:03,581
that; they made Me run up and down, do this
and that, Ultimately they all had to come

231
00:25:03,581 --> 00:25:05,591
here.

232
00:25:05,591 --> 00:25:07,631
But I was telling them, “Go and have a look.”

233
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:19,131
Nobody would look at it, nobody would listen
to Me, nobody wanted to know about it.

234
00:25:19,131 --> 00:25:32,131
How things work out – is your pure desire
that can work out anything that you want.

235
00:25:32,131 --> 00:25:36,051
But you won’t want funny things also.

236
00:25:36,051 --> 00:25:41,041
Like Shri Ganesha would not like to follow
some entrepreneur who is saying, “Have a

237
00:25:41,041 --> 00:25:44,770
punk on your head”, or something.

238
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:49,201
Is stupidity, all kinds of stupidities.

239
00:25:49,201 --> 00:25:55,351
Because you are stupid, these entrepreneurs
are having a good time; they can befool us

240
00:25:55,351 --> 00:25:57,941
all the time.

241
00:25:57,941 --> 00:26:10,281
At His state, He is Himself, on top of the
pure desire.

242
00:26:10,281 --> 00:26:16,241
The pure desire is on His stomach, tied up
nicely.

243
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:33,631
It is to be seen in Sahaja Yoga how things
work out, how miraculously they work out,

244
00:26:33,631 --> 00:26:36,051
and these can happen to you also.

245
00:26:36,051 --> 00:26:42,681
All these Powers can come to you also.

246
00:26:42,681 --> 00:26:47,941
You know about some people who came to us
who didn’t know even how to sing.

247
00:26:47,941 --> 00:26:52,261
I mean, they had no voices; something very
funny they had – I mean I didn’t know

248
00:26:52,261 --> 00:26:57,890
from where they learnt to even talk.

249
00:26:57,890 --> 00:27:03,501
When they opened their mouths, if you were
at one note, they were on another note and

250
00:27:03,501 --> 00:27:09,071
they went on and on and on without even listening
to what they were singing.

251
00:27:09,071 --> 00:27:17,141
After some time, I find they are singing beautifully.

252
00:27:17,141 --> 00:27:21,941
So the Kundalini itself is working it out,
the pure desire is working it out, but what

253
00:27:21,941 --> 00:27:23,471
about you?

254
00:27:23,471 --> 00:27:29,791
What are you doing about it is to be seen.

255
00:27:29,791 --> 00:27:43,331
There are so many things that could be understood
very easily through the lifestyle of Shri

256
00:27:43,331 --> 00:27:44,341
Ganesha.

257
00:27:44,341 --> 00:27:58,900
The first and foremost thing for Him is to
obey His Mother – never to say no, no question,

258
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:08,071
and also not to ask why.

259
00:28:08,071 --> 00:28:16,221
He will go and fight with all the Gods and
Goddesses and every one.

260
00:28:16,221 --> 00:28:23,351
And that’s what Christ has said, “Anything
against Me I’ve tolerated but nothing against

261
00:28:23,351 --> 00:28:28,010
the Holy Ghost.”

262
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:42,701
There should be no question, there should
be no explanation.

263
00:28:42,701 --> 00:28:52,081
Sometimes even My patience goes out, the way
they do not want to accept what I am telling

264
00:28:52,081 --> 00:28:53,081
them.

265
00:28:53,081 --> 00:28:58,131
At the end of course they all come around,
no doubt – at the end.

266
00:28:58,131 --> 00:29:01,491
But you waste so much time convincing them.

267
00:29:01,491 --> 00:29:04,751
What is the reason?

268
00:29:04,751 --> 00:29:08,531
They have no wisdom to know what their Mother
is.

269
00:29:08,531 --> 00:29:17,751
Like, you know the story of Shri Ganesha that
His Mother said, “The one who goes round

270
00:29:17,751 --> 00:29:23,640
the Mother Earth, I will give you a present.”

271
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:34,760
So, Ganesha again accepts a little mouse as
a transport – imagine.

272
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:41,231
Nowadays people can’t believe it that Shri
Ganesha, so powerful, should accept just a

273
00:29:41,231 --> 00:29:43,701
mouse for His transport.

274
00:29:43,701 --> 00:29:55,451
Because He’s so humble; he doesn’t have
to show off His Lincoln or Mercedes to anyone;

275
00:29:55,451 --> 00:30:01,711
He is very comfortable with His mouse.

276
00:30:01,711 --> 00:30:05,001
Now what does He do?

277
00:30:05,001 --> 00:30:07,991
He thinks that…

278
00:30:07,991 --> 00:30:14,891
He understands, in no time, that His Mother
is much greater than the Mother Earth.

279
00:30:14,891 --> 00:30:19,410
“So why should I go round the Mother Earth?”

280
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:26,851
His brother is going round on a peacock.

281
00:30:26,851 --> 00:30:32,061
He just goes round His Mother – He gets
the present.

282
00:30:32,061 --> 00:30:46,621
It’s such a simple thing to understand because
He is the wisest person.

283
00:30:46,621 --> 00:31:03,271
The wisest person knows what is what, he knows
who is who, he knows what are the qualities

284
00:31:03,271 --> 00:31:05,381
of these persons.

285
00:31:05,381 --> 00:31:16,311
He is not impressed by superficial things,
no.

286
00:31:16,311 --> 00:31:24,441
If somebody is well dressed, then people get
very much impressed by them, and they turn

287
00:31:24,441 --> 00:31:37,681
out to be bank robbers – walking with umbrellas
and with lined suits, as if some big executives

288
00:31:37,681 --> 00:31:48,071
are coming, and they decamp with all the loot.

289
00:31:48,071 --> 00:32:00,481
So for a wise person, the superficial behavior
doesn’t appeal, not bothered.

290
00:32:00,481 --> 00:32:16,130
It is a kind of a very penetrating intelligence;
just like a computer you know.

291
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:18,471
In a second you know that what is this gentleman.

292
00:32:18,471 --> 00:32:25,650
Oh, he may come with a great, you see, ado
and he might come and praise you and do this

293
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:35,211
and do that and you know the person very well.

294
00:32:35,211 --> 00:32:46,041
If some body is unduly very friendly, very
kind, very nice, not necessarily that he is

295
00:32:46,041 --> 00:32:56,650
really appreciating you but he is looking
at your purse, maybe, maybe something else.

296
00:32:56,650 --> 00:33:06,160
But not only on this level, it is even on
a spiritual level we have to understand how

297
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:18,191
people try to put you down spiritually; what
they try, what tricks they try on you.

298
00:33:18,191 --> 00:33:26,231
It could be your husband, your wife, your
children, your relations, your friends, anybody,

299
00:33:26,231 --> 00:33:28,301
any Sahaja Yogi.

300
00:33:28,301 --> 00:33:31,321
But in the case of Shri Ganesha, it’s the
other way round.

301
00:33:31,321 --> 00:33:37,721
They say that if you put one apple, bad apple,
all the apples get spoilt.

302
00:33:37,721 --> 00:33:49,001
But if you put Shri Ganesha among all the
bad apples, they’ll get all right.

303
00:33:49,001 --> 00:33:53,981
Because He’s the life-giving force.

304
00:33:53,981 --> 00:34:09,971
This is one of the greatest qualities, that
He knows that He is the source of life and

305
00:34:09,971 --> 00:34:13,371
He gives life, He gives Chaitanya.

306
00:34:13,371 --> 00:34:21,651
He doesn’t say… think that, “Now supposing
I give Chaitanya, give life to this person,

307
00:34:21,651 --> 00:34:25,061
my ego will come up,” – very common problem.

308
00:34:25,061 --> 00:34:32,151
“Mother I don’t want to do it because
my ego will come up.”

309
00:34:32,151 --> 00:34:36,220
Everybody is psychoanalyzing themselves ‘because
this will happen’ – Baba!

310
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:38,101
[- Hindi expression of a general exclamatory
nature –ed.]

311
00:34:38,101 --> 00:34:42,811
You are all realized souls now, you are all
saints.

312
00:34:42,811 --> 00:34:49,011
The false people are talking so big, and you
the people who have got something are still

313
00:34:49,011 --> 00:34:52,351
thinking, “My ego will come up, this will
happen.”

314
00:34:52,351 --> 00:34:58,231
No, no, you have the powers.

315
00:34:58,231 --> 00:35:09,051
But as you keep it under a manger, as Christ
has said, the light will go out.

316
00:35:09,051 --> 00:35:20,970
You have to give it to others, you have to
open it out.

317
00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:23,051
And that is how you will judge your state.

318
00:35:23,051 --> 00:35:25,701
“What is my state?

319
00:35:25,701 --> 00:35:27,771
Let’s see.

320
00:35:27,771 --> 00:35:30,861
Where am I?”

321
00:35:30,861 --> 00:35:38,351
That confidence, take it from Me, should be
with you.

322
00:35:38,351 --> 00:35:43,891
All of you have to work out this way.

323
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:45,871
Very many…

324
00:35:45,871 --> 00:35:48,141
“Mother, my Mooladhara is caught up.”

325
00:35:48,141 --> 00:35:52,021
How dare anybody catch Mooladhar?

326
00:35:52,021 --> 00:35:56,071
That’s the anger of Shri Ganesha.

327
00:35:56,071 --> 00:35:59,361
How dare?

328
00:35:59,361 --> 00:36:02,970
How can anybody?

329
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:11,771
What’s missing is complete faith in yourself
and faith in your Mother.

330
00:36:11,771 --> 00:36:19,751
In Russia recently… in Prague, there was
a lady who was brought on the stage, very

331
00:36:19,751 --> 00:36:20,951
old lady, couldn’t walk.

332
00:36:20,951 --> 00:36:27,220
I mean they just carried her and she came
and sat before Me on a chair.

333
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:29,481
She said, “I know You…

334
00:36:29,481 --> 00:36:30,831
I’ll be cured.

335
00:36:30,831 --> 00:36:34,741
I am in Your presence; I know I will be cured.”

336
00:36:34,741 --> 00:36:35,861
I said, “Then get up.”

337
00:36:35,861 --> 00:36:37,091
She got up.

338
00:36:37,091 --> 00:36:41,631
Those who were with Me in Prague, you can
ask them.

339
00:36:41,631 --> 00:36:47,970
She came down and she started running, and
everybody laughed.

340
00:36:47,970 --> 00:37:00,651
But her faith – she was not a Sahaja Yogini
as such – but she was sure; she knew Me.

341
00:37:00,651 --> 00:37:04,761
And she just started running like that and
everybody started looking at her.

342
00:37:04,761 --> 00:37:13,461
Same thing happened in Russia for many people
– very serious diseases.

343
00:37:13,461 --> 00:37:22,460
So that, one thing is for sure, either you
don’t know that you are realized souls or

344
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:26,731
else you don’t know Me, one of the two things.

345
00:37:26,731 --> 00:37:29,741
Why was He so obedient to His Mother?

346
00:37:29,741 --> 00:37:31,411
Why was He?

347
00:37:31,411 --> 00:37:33,191
Because that was the wisest thing to do.

348
00:37:33,191 --> 00:37:45,411
The one who knows everything, it’s better
to be guided by that person.

349
00:37:45,411 --> 00:37:49,791
And many a times I have seen, people try to
do things without telling Me, important things

350
00:37:49,791 --> 00:37:52,660
– they fall into traps.

351
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:59,901
Then they come back to Me and I tell them
the solution, it works.

352
00:37:59,901 --> 00:38:05,461
It’s not necessary that you should tell
Me everything.

353
00:38:05,461 --> 00:38:16,541
But when you are in a fix, you can always
just go into yourself and ask yourself, “What

354
00:38:16,541 --> 00:38:17,571
would Mother do?”

355
00:38:17,571 --> 00:38:20,511
You’ll get the answer.

356
00:38:20,511 --> 00:38:22,861
You are at a… quite a higher state.

357
00:38:22,861 --> 00:38:28,281
But still, even if you are on a tree and you
are still thinking you are falling down, you

358
00:38:28,281 --> 00:38:30,531
are nowhere.

359
00:38:30,531 --> 00:38:32,781
Steady yourself.

360
00:38:32,781 --> 00:38:42,621
That’s what is, we say, the Adhishthan of
Shri Ganesha.

361
00:38:42,621 --> 00:38:51,331
Is the steadiness, steadiness in your achievements
of Sahaj Yog.

362
00:38:51,331 --> 00:38:59,171
Believing in yourself that you have entered
into the new world, into the new atmosphere

363
00:39:00,909 --> 00:39:06,322
It is for you now, to work it out.

364
00:39:06,323 --> 00:39:13,503
Shri Ganesha is just waiting.

365
00:39:13,503 --> 00:39:17,393
But He is not meant for people who have no
courage.

366
00:39:17,393 --> 00:39:34,376
Such a courageous man who could go and fight
with all the Devas, because He knew the Shakti

367
00:39:34,376 --> 00:39:40,983
was with Him.

368
00:39:40,983 --> 00:39:50,343
Today is such a joyous day for Me because
we have children, and we are dealing with

369
00:39:50,343 --> 00:39:51,343
children.

370
00:39:51,343 --> 00:39:53,343
Most of them are born realized.

371
00:39:53,343 --> 00:40:04,343
They are of a very special category, I have
told you many a times, but we spoil them;

372
00:40:04,343 --> 00:40:12,453
because we were not born realized, so we don’t
know how to handle these children, we spoil

373
00:40:12,453 --> 00:40:13,453
them.

374
00:40:13,453 --> 00:40:18,983
Not only we spoil them, but we interfere with
the school, we interfere with this as if we

375
00:40:18,983 --> 00:40:29,103
are the wisest parents ever living.

376
00:40:29,103 --> 00:40:35,613
Because we are Sahaja Yogis, we have to be
much more sensible than other parents.

377
00:40:35,613 --> 00:40:39,123
How can you interfere with any school anywhere?

378
00:40:39,123 --> 00:40:47,143
But in Sahaja Yoga you will.

379
00:40:47,143 --> 00:40:57,373
It is because there is no wisdom and no understanding
what is good and benevolent for your child.

380
00:40:57,373 --> 00:41:02,343
If you love your child, then you must think
of its benevolent.

381
00:41:02,343 --> 00:41:09,233
You must learn from the experience what happens
to children if they are left like that.

382
00:41:09,233 --> 00:41:16,383
You cannot spoil your child, you cannot because
it’s a special category of children they

383
00:41:16,383 --> 00:41:17,383
are.

384
00:41:17,383 --> 00:41:28,723
They are not children who can become vagabonds;
they cannot become thieves.

385
00:41:28,723 --> 00:41:36,413
So you will make them something funny – they
are neither here nor there.

386
00:41:36,413 --> 00:41:45,013
They are born realized and they have to be
channelized properly, to achieve their complete

387
00:41:45,013 --> 00:41:52,843
manifestation of their Spirit.

388
00:41:52,843 --> 00:42:03,022
So the possessiveness and the stupid attachments
to children must be given up.

389
00:42:03,022 --> 00:42:08,853
There is no force on you – if you want to
destroy a child, you can destroy.

390
00:42:08,853 --> 00:42:15,503
But in an advice – if you were Ganeshas,
you would have understood it, I don’t have

391
00:42:15,503 --> 00:42:19,693
to explain so much.

392
00:42:19,693 --> 00:42:27,353
What is good for your child, because we have
to have beautiful children.

393
00:42:27,353 --> 00:42:29,643
They are born beautiful children, I tell you.

394
00:42:29,643 --> 00:42:34,373
If they are spoilt, it is because of you,
you have spoilt them.

395
00:42:34,373 --> 00:42:36,793
You have ruined them.

396
00:42:36,793 --> 00:42:39,353
You are responsible.

397
00:42:39,353 --> 00:42:47,253
I know of so many children – they’re very,
very sweet.

398
00:42:47,253 --> 00:42:54,953
I have conference with them also and I find
them much more congenial; I have much better

399
00:42:54,953 --> 00:43:00,113
rapport with them than I can have with you.

400
00:43:00,113 --> 00:43:03,193
They never argue, never.

401
00:43:03,193 --> 00:43:14,042
They never says no, and they have very good
information about all of you.

402
00:43:14,042 --> 00:43:20,983
So it is such a nice thing that today you
should desire that our children should very

403
00:43:20,983 --> 00:43:31,833
soon become the images of Shri Ganesha, His
Ganas, who have to work out so much.

404
00:43:31,833 --> 00:43:35,113
It’s a tremendous task.

405
00:43:35,113 --> 00:43:43,093
Sahaja Yoga is the greatest achievement of
Spiritual evolution.

406
00:43:43,093 --> 00:43:47,693
We all have to dedicate ourselves.

407
00:43:47,693 --> 00:43:53,663
We don’t have to sacrifice anything as the
Saints have sacrificed – nothing, don’t

408
00:43:53,663 --> 00:43:55,243
have to suffer anything.

409
00:43:55,243 --> 00:43:58,143
Only thing you have to have – wisdom.

410
00:43:58,143 --> 00:44:04,562
For that, I am very happy that today we are
worshipping Shri Ganesha.

411
00:44:04,562 --> 00:44:13,263
So the pure desire should be that, “Shri
Ganesha please give us Divine Wisdom.”

412
00:44:13,263 --> 00:44:15,243
That’s all.

413
00:44:15,243 --> 00:44:18,126
It contains everything in it.

414
00:44:18,127 --> 00:44:20,112
May God bless you.
