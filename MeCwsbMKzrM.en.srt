1
00:00:01,846 --> 00:00:04,545
First, I’ll speak in English language,

2
00:00:04,746 --> 00:00:10,333
because we have so many people from foreign countries,

3
00:00:10,667 --> 00:00:12,865
and especially from Madras (Chennai)

4
00:00:13,048 --> 00:00:18,161
and also from Kerala,

5
00:00:18,362 --> 00:00:22,050
Hyderabad and Bangalore.

6
00:00:22,931 --> 00:00:25,801
All these people have come here,

7
00:00:26,002 --> 00:00:28,846
and I don’t know what other people are here,

8
00:00:29,211 --> 00:00:34,707
who have come from South

9
00:00:34,908 --> 00:00:42,048
and who do not yet understand Hindi language.

10
00:00:52,029 --> 00:00:56,654
This Shivaratri has a special meaning, I think,

11
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:00,755
because

12
00:01:04,061 --> 00:01:11,242
there is so much –

13
00:01:11,443 --> 00:01:16,656
if you read any newspaper in the morning,

14
00:01:16,857 --> 00:01:23,123
such horrible news is there

15
00:01:23,385 --> 00:01:28,969
about the people who are trying to create

16
00:01:29,334 --> 00:01:36,765
all kinds of violence, corruption

17
00:01:36,966 --> 00:01:41,609
and immoral behaviour.

18
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:49,688
You are surprised how, these
days, it is so full of

19
00:01:50,251 --> 00:01:55,250
all these criminalities going round us.

20
00:01:56,528 --> 00:02:03,321
This is the time, as if come, for

21
00:02:03,346 --> 00:02:08,820
the “Taandav nrutya” (cosmic dance) of Shri Shiva.

22
00:02:09,956 --> 00:02:15,083
Otherwise, one feels things cannot improve.

23
00:02:15,679 --> 00:02:20,022
It is His anger, if it starts,

24
00:02:20,848 --> 00:02:26,080
throwing wrath on people of this character and this type.

25
00:02:27,366 --> 00:02:34,216
I don’t know how anyone can save from His wrath.

26
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:38,940
He’s a God who is full of love,

27
00:02:40,067 --> 00:02:44,299
full of tremendous compassion,

28
00:02:45,609 --> 00:02:57,852
but also the- another extreme of very destroying character.

29
00:02:59,024 --> 00:03:01,026
He can destroy the whole world.

30
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:09,544
He can finish all the creatures that have been created

31
00:03:11,092 --> 00:03:14,420
if He gets into a temper.

32
00:03:20,311 --> 00:03:22,495
You all must be knowing the story,

33
00:03:23,058 --> 00:03:27,888
how He went into ecstasy.

34
00:03:29,866 --> 00:03:35,806
There was a devil who had taken a form of a child.

35
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:38,974
And a mother cannot kill the child,

36
00:03:40,537 --> 00:03:43,406
she cannot. And She thought

37
00:03:43,863 --> 00:03:51,699
She won’t be able to save the world from the wrath

38
00:03:53,267 --> 00:03:56,524
or anger of Shiva

39
00:03:57,445 --> 00:04:02,050
if He sees the whole world destroyed by this devil.

40
00:04:08,712 --> 00:04:14,013
So She withdrew from Her act

41
00:04:15,148 --> 00:04:21,332
of sacrificing the child or killing the child

42
00:04:22,754 --> 00:04:26,231
and it was Shiva who took over.

43
00:04:27,716 --> 00:04:33,869
And He just stood on the back of the child and killed him.

44
00:04:34,535 --> 00:04:36,234
That child was a devil.

45
00:04:37,537 --> 00:04:41,244
And so, He saved the world

46
00:04:42,428 --> 00:04:46,117
from the destruction of this horrible rakshasa.

47
00:04:47,561 --> 00:04:50,365
And then He danced with joy.

48
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:56,263
That’s what they call as a cosmic, cosmic joy.

49
00:04:58,017 --> 00:05:00,231
Many people don’t understand why

50
00:05:00,652 --> 00:05:02,923
He’s standing on top of a little child,

51
00:05:03,923 --> 00:05:05,503
but the reason was this.

52
00:05:06,352 --> 00:05:10,378
So, even people may camouflage today

53
00:05:11,251 --> 00:05:16,536
as small children, as very innocent people,

54
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:24,832
as very holy gurus,

55
00:05:26,525 --> 00:05:28,890
Shiva can destroy all of them.

56
00:05:30,986 --> 00:05:33,695
This destruction has already started

57
00:05:35,076 --> 00:05:38,576
and is going with a full speed, I think, all over,

58
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:42,491
through so many things that are happening:

59
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:48,564
we have got hurricanes,

60
00:05:50,723 --> 00:05:53,993
storms, earthquakes,

61
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,019
many accidents,

62
00:05:58,186 --> 00:06:01,765
and so many destructive things are working out

63
00:06:02,463 --> 00:06:06,561
which are the outcome of Kalaki [Kalki] incarnation.

64
00:06:07,847 --> 00:06:09,632
But, at the same time,

65
00:06:10,601 --> 00:06:14,801
there is another work going on, of the same incarnation:

66
00:06:15,801 --> 00:06:18,714
is the resurrection of the people.

67
00:06:19,762 --> 00:06:22,462
Such people can never be hurt,

68
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:25,851
nothing can happen to them.

69
00:06:26,716 --> 00:06:28,470
They’ll be always saved.

70
00:06:29,272 --> 00:06:31,425
Everything will be saved for them

71
00:06:32,036 --> 00:06:37,396
because they are under the protection of their Mother.

72
00:06:40,224 --> 00:06:44,078
Now the problem is

73
00:06:44,554 --> 00:06:50,610
how can we the Sahaja Yogis deal with such people

74
00:06:50,811 --> 00:06:56,626
and to see that they go out of the circulation of evolution?

75
00:06:59,507 --> 00:07:02,716
Only solution is raising the Kundalini.

76
00:07:04,556 --> 00:07:07,815
If you raise the Kundalini of human beings,

77
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:13,386
who are even very bad and gone cases,

78
00:07:13,982 --> 00:07:19,519
either they will be destroyed or they will be saved

79
00:07:19,789 --> 00:07:22,132
and they’ll become good people.

80
00:07:23,465 --> 00:07:26,301
They will stop all this

81
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,496
horrible things they are thinking and planning in their heads

82
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,948
and they’ll become really very, very good people.

83
00:07:39,986 --> 00:07:43,004
It may fail in some cases – I wouldn’t say

84
00:07:43,205 --> 00:07:47,101
that Sahaja Yoga would be successful in every case.

85
00:07:48,037 --> 00:07:50,580
But if Sahaja Yogis meditate

86
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:55,199
and keep themselves in complete peace

87
00:07:55,953 --> 00:08:00,947
and also completely surrendered,

88
00:08:01,915 --> 00:08:03,963
nothing can happen to them.

89
00:08:05,767 --> 00:08:09,544
They are always protected and you all have an experience

90
00:08:09,892 --> 00:08:10,965
of that protection.

91
00:08:12,338 --> 00:08:15,753
But first you should have faith in yourself

92
00:08:16,547 --> 00:08:19,943
and complete surrendering to Sahaja Yoga.

93
00:08:21,388 --> 00:08:24,247
We are so many Sahaja Yogis sitting here,

94
00:08:25,565 --> 00:08:29,620
mostly from North, South, East and West of India,

95
00:08:30,065 --> 00:08:32,265
and also from other foreign countries.

96
00:08:33,583 --> 00:08:38,111
Every country is, today, under the,

97
00:08:39,817 --> 00:08:43,087
we should say, under the control of these negative forces.

98
00:08:44,198 --> 00:08:48,982
What we have to do is to make people positive

99
00:08:49,665 --> 00:08:51,443
through Kundalini awakening.

100
00:08:51,951 --> 00:08:53,665
This you all can do.

101
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:55,659
This you can achieve.

102
00:08:56,357 --> 00:09:00,715
For this, you don’t have to do something special.

103
00:09:01,461 --> 00:09:06,407
In day-to-day life, you can achieve it and you should do it.

104
00:09:06,772 --> 00:09:10,956
This is the only thing that is needed today,

105
00:09:11,068 --> 00:09:14,780
is to transform people and you all can do it,

106
00:09:15,391 --> 00:09:22,179
all of you can do it in a very sincere and a good manner.

107
00:09:23,243 --> 00:09:28,195
You don’t have to get to temper, jump at people,

108
00:09:28,862 --> 00:09:30,872
get angry with rude people,

109
00:09:31,245 --> 00:09:34,999
but with peaceful attitude, you should achieve it;

110
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:43,286
so that this wrathful temperament of Shiva,

111
00:09:43,461 --> 00:09:46,670
as they say, the third eye of Shiva won’t open.

112
00:09:47,659 --> 00:09:49,781
That’s something horrible.

113
00:09:50,773 --> 00:09:53,674
We all can do it in a very constructive manner,

114
00:09:54,316 --> 00:09:56,666
extremely in a constructive manner.

115
00:09:57,491 --> 00:10:00,912
So what we should do is to, first of all,

116
00:10:01,261 --> 00:10:07,643
establish our own Shiva principle, is the principle of joy,

117
00:10:11,167 --> 00:10:12,913
principle of love

118
00:10:14,564 --> 00:10:17,388
and principle of Truth, I should say.

119
00:10:19,396 --> 00:10:22,237
There are big problems, also,

120
00:10:23,046 --> 00:10:26,041
because people have no idea

121
00:10:26,898 --> 00:10:34,495
as to Shiva’s global temperament.

122
00:10:37,892 --> 00:10:42,442
For example, I have heard people
quarrelling and fighting over

123
00:10:42,847 --> 00:10:46,220
Shiva principle and Vishnu principle.

124
00:10:48,404 --> 00:10:51,214
Now, Vishnu is there, His power is there

125
00:10:52,326 --> 00:10:55,789
for you to rise up to this Shiva principle.

126
00:10:58,273 --> 00:11:03,117
Both are not different, one is supplementary for another.

127
00:11:04,244 --> 00:11:06,784
But if you go on fighting even on that point,

128
00:11:07,276 --> 00:11:08,602
I can’t understand.

129
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:13,041
You cannot please Shiva without Vishnu.

130
00:11:14,731 --> 00:11:20,590
And if you cannot stick to Shiva’s principle,

131
00:11:20,987 --> 00:11:24,051
 if you have not understood the Vishnu principle –

132
00:11:26,577 --> 00:11:31,172
Kundalini itself rises through the Sushumna Nadi.

133
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:37,277
She is the principle, She is the “tattwa” of Shiva.

134
00:11:38,702 --> 00:11:42,777
And She rises through the channel

135
00:11:43,087 --> 00:11:47,931
that is made by Vishnu out of evolutionary process.

136
00:11:49,343 --> 00:11:54,195
So how can you do away with one of Them?

137
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:58,187
One is the road, another is the destination.

138
00:11:59,687 --> 00:12:03,205
So I hope you understand how important it is

139
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:06,824
that your centers should be corrected,

140
00:12:07,388 --> 00:12:09,993
your road should be alright,

141
00:12:10,787 --> 00:12:13,588
that your Sushumna should be cleared,

142
00:12:13,937 --> 00:12:16,813
because we are “madhyamargis”:

143
00:12:17,575 --> 00:12:19,670
we have to go by the centre,

144
00:12:20,733 --> 00:12:24,774
by the central path and we have to have the balance,

145
00:12:25,401 --> 00:12:28,559
not to go to the left and not to go to the right.

146
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:32,338
This balance we must keep

147
00:12:32,539 --> 00:12:34,645
and go on moving until you reach

148
00:12:35,145 --> 00:12:39,193
your “talu bhaag” (Brahmarandhra) where sits Sadashiva.

149
00:12:40,961 --> 00:12:44,838
You can experience it, you can see for yourself.

150
00:12:45,663 --> 00:12:49,105
Whatever I am saying, you know it very well.

151
00:12:49,566 --> 00:12:53,899
Only thing is when I am telling you, you can verify.

152
00:12:55,439 --> 00:12:58,719
Sahaja Yoga can be verified very easily,

153
00:12:59,517 --> 00:13:05,308
and you know that, that you now know the only truth.

154
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:10,840
The truth which is absolute.

155
00:13:11,872 --> 00:13:17,183
This is also the principle which starts showing results

156
00:13:17,564 --> 00:13:21,333
when these two powers meet.

157
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:27,788
It is very surprising that, when these two powers meet,

158
00:13:28,653 --> 00:13:33,812
or when you reach Shiva principle through the Vishnu principle,

159
00:13:34,351 --> 00:13:35,981
then you realize

160
00:13:38,489 --> 00:13:44,232
that these two powers are so complimentary

161
00:13:45,176 --> 00:13:52,115
and so much related to each other.

162
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:56,591
There’s no difference, in a way,

163
00:13:57,663 --> 00:13:59,387
between these two powers.

164
00:13:59,959 --> 00:14:06,141
And, so, keep your road “madhyamarga” [central channel] clean

165
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:09,350
and let the Kundalini pass through it.

166
00:14:10,749 --> 00:14:13,374
When the Kundalini will pass through it,

167
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:20,876
you’ll be amazed that the same Kundalini

168
00:14:21,077 --> 00:14:23,384
is going through the Vishnu path

169
00:14:23,585 --> 00:14:28,741
and reaching at the lotus feet of Shiva.

170
00:14:33,712 --> 00:14:40,505
All of you recognise Shivji, and He is worshiped.

171
00:14:41,925 --> 00:14:45,933
But, you do not know the different aspects of His qualities.

172
00:14:46,551 --> 00:14:49,942
That is why, many times you make mistakes.

173
00:14:51,978 --> 00:14:56,223
The most important form of  Shivji is bliss and joy.

174
00:14:57,357 --> 00:15:03,214
And this joy is spread everywhere in subtle and subtlest forms.

175
00:15:03,532 --> 00:15:09,468
But, until you become spiritually subtle to absorb this,

176
00:15:09,755 --> 00:15:13,929
you will neither be able to see this nor understand this.

177
00:15:14,453 --> 00:15:16,649
He resides in everything,

178
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:22,121
He resides in everything

179
00:15:26,449 --> 00:15:31,664
and in a way we can say He creates a joyful realm.

180
00:15:31,865 --> 00:15:36,992
And when you look around in that realm, you find

181
00:15:37,193 --> 00:15:40,217
that you have been transformed into something else.

182
00:15:40,464 --> 00:15:44,582
Other people find happiness in different things.

183
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:51,558
Many people find happiness in destroying themselves.

184
00:15:52,728 --> 00:15:56,696
By taking to different wrong paths,

185
00:15:57,351 --> 00:16:03,223
people think that if we go against the Spirit, we can find happiness.

186
00:16:04,448 --> 00:16:10,361
But, the Atma [Spirit], Which is verily Shivji,

187
00:16:12,752 --> 00:16:15,776
finds joy in a different way.

188
00:16:17,047 --> 00:16:20,983
And only that can touch our heart.

189
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:28,222
Like, there are a lot of people who are immersed in material things.

190
00:16:28,947 --> 00:16:33,581
Some take to alchohol,  some indulge into sinful activities,

191
00:16:33,852 --> 00:16:36,091
they keep doing all wrong things

192
00:16:36,432 --> 00:16:39,717
and they think that there is a lot of happiness in that.

193
00:16:40,211 --> 00:16:41,446
But it is not so.

194
00:16:41,978 --> 00:16:46,398
 gradually they get destroyed and slowly, they are finished.

195
00:16:47,968 --> 00:16:52,750
But, Shivji is the one who comforts us,

196
00:16:53,147 --> 00:16:57,322
He gives us peace and He gives us joy.

197
00:16:58,967 --> 00:17:05,983
And when the Power of Shiva and the Power of Vishnu,

198
00:17:06,472 --> 00:17:10,246
– like Kundalini and Sushumna Nadi;

199
00:17:11,056 --> 00:17:17,143
when unite with each other, you get the absolute Truth.

200
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:20,349
absolute Truth.

201
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:26,706
Such that you cannot, in any way,

202
00:17:26,907 --> 00:17:29,072
refuse to accept this Truth.

203
00:17:29,273 --> 00:17:31,528
Because it is the absolute Truth.

204
00:17:32,198 --> 00:17:35,769
Which you can feel on your fingertips, on your hands.

205
00:17:37,548 --> 00:17:40,190
You will have many types of experiences,

206
00:17:40,624 --> 00:17:45,552
by which you will understand that in the absolute Truth

207
00:17:47,055 --> 00:17:50,377
there is not even an iota of untruth.

208
00:17:50,578 --> 00:17:58,337
That is known within you; you can know it, understand it.

209
00:17:58,981 --> 00:18:02,322
This is the gift given by the Kundalini.

210
00:18:03,445 --> 00:18:07,198
This means that the Kundalini, which is the Shakti [Power] of Shiva,

211
00:18:07,418 --> 00:18:12,512
when She rises through the central channel,

212
00:18:13,141 --> 00:18:17,954
She awakens all the chakras, aligns them in its entirety,

213
00:18:18,155 --> 00:18:20,355
and integrates them

214
00:18:20,556 --> 00:18:24,914
Who looks after that Shakti [Power]?

215
00:18:25,748 --> 00:18:28,597
We can say that Shri Vishnu looks after Her,

216
00:18:29,329 --> 00:18:32,200
because She moves in the central path of Vishnu.

217
00:18:32,522 --> 00:18:35,093
And then She reaches the Brahmarandhra,

218
00:18:36,966 --> 00:18:38,712
and appears there.

219
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:43,027
And on reaching there we can understand that

220
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:47,508
Her journey is now complete.

221
00:18:48,365 --> 00:18:52,506
So we can see so much cooperation and understanding among them.

222
00:18:53,923 --> 00:18:55,536
But, we people are there,

223
00:18:56,823 --> 00:19:01,228
now a type of disease has come that everyone is running after money.

224
00:19:01,938 --> 00:19:05,493
Running after money has become a very peculier disease.

225
00:19:05,934 --> 00:19:08,576
And for that we are willing to do anything,

226
00:19:08,926 --> 00:19:10,822
We take support from anything,

227
00:19:11,029 --> 00:19:13,229
Even in Sahaja Yoga people do that.

228
00:19:13,531 --> 00:19:18,014
The reason for this is that some sort of defect has crept into us.

229
00:19:19,501 --> 00:19:22,858
A lot of negativities have accumulated in us.

230
00:19:23,743 --> 00:19:28,109
And these negativities can be cleansed only by Kundalini.

231
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:36,972
But, until you do not become one with the Kundalini,

232
00:19:37,173 --> 00:19:40,961
and through meditation if you do not develop It,

233
00:19:42,255 --> 00:19:45,874
then you cannot reach that state where,

234
00:19:46,748 --> 00:19:50,207
the Power is manifested in you,

235
00:19:50,685 --> 00:19:55,771
the Power which is the truth, it is joy giving, peace giving -

236
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:58,890
– a weakness remains in it.

237
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:02,838
When the Kundalini rises, She cleanses everything.

238
00:20:04,155 --> 00:20:07,226
With the Power of Shivji, everything gets cleansed.

239
00:20:07,738 --> 00:20:11,525
But, still some people because of their old habits

240
00:20:11,859 --> 00:20:14,726
or because of wrong ideals, suffer a lot.

241
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:21,678
And those people – with whatever that is wrong,

242
00:20:22,748 --> 00:20:25,946
whatever bad habits of theirs,

243
00:20:27,363 --> 00:20:32,632
even with the slightest temptation they fall from their ascent.

244
00:20:34,371 --> 00:20:38,893
Even if an atom of negativity is left within us,

245
00:20:39,266 --> 00:20:42,107
remaining within,

246
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:46,788
We can fall due to that, and get completely destroyed

247
00:20:47,873 --> 00:20:52,215
Those who come to the Pujas and meditate,

248
00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:55,334
those people always make progress.

249
00:20:56,426 --> 00:21:03,719
If there is no peace, even a tree cannot survive, it cannot grow.

250
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,680
Even germination cannot take place.

251
00:21:06,881 --> 00:21:10,554
That is why, within you,

252
00:21:10,755 --> 00:21:15,430
if you don't have this meditative quality, don't have these ideals,

253
00:21:15,631 --> 00:21:18,263
that we will never go towards downfall,

254
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:21,946
we will not succumb to any bad habits,

255
00:21:22,147 --> 00:21:27,072
then you should attend all the pujas – as many as possible

256
00:21:27,273 --> 00:21:29,996
and you should be in meditation.

257
00:21:30,197 --> 00:21:33,453
Because now you have the right to do puja.

258
00:21:33,654 --> 00:21:35,606
Everyone doesn’t have the right to do Pujas.

259
00:21:35,734 --> 00:21:37,603
Anyone and everyone goes to do puja.

260
00:21:37,826 --> 00:21:40,444
But when there is no connection,

261
00:21:40,659 --> 00:21:43,559
then how can you be authorised to do a puja?

262
00:21:44,153 --> 00:21:45,978
But many people think-

263
00:21:46,146 --> 00:21:49,876
go to this temple or that temple; go to this guru or that guru.

264
00:21:50,066 --> 00:21:51,202
Nothing comes out of that.

265
00:21:51,378 --> 00:21:53,108
You are your own guru,

266
00:21:53,299 --> 00:21:57,068
and only you can introspect and think, ’what is the problem in me’?

267
00:21:57,396 --> 00:22:03,848
’In our heart are we completely accepting Sahaja Yoga or not'?

268
00:22:04,827 --> 00:22:07,659
I have seen a lot of people come into Sahaja Yoga

269
00:22:07,816 --> 00:22:12,363
and after reaching a certain height, they fall.

270
00:22:12,962 --> 00:22:16,025
The higher they rise, the lower they fall.

271
00:22:16,691 --> 00:22:20,826
The reason is that the hidden tendencies in you,

272
00:22:21,175 --> 00:22:25,937
have somehow become active, without you being aware of it.

273
00:22:27,506 --> 00:22:29,743
That is why you must pay attention

274
00:22:30,053 --> 00:22:33,990
– ’hope I am not falling into wrong things’,

275
00:22:34,764 --> 00:22:41,336
or ’hope, I am not doing anything wrong which is against Sahaja?

276
00:22:42,133 --> 00:22:47,691
or ’have some bad motives arisen in me that

277
00:22:48,048 --> 00:22:52,046
I have come to Sahaja with the idea of making money?’

278
00:22:52,247 --> 00:22:55,588
Or ,’I have come into Sahaja Yoga to do something bad?’

279
00:22:55,987 --> 00:22:59,112
Our attention should be towards these things.

280
00:22:59,313 --> 00:23:02,789
The best thing is that, whatever activities of Sahaja are there –

281
00:23:02,956 --> 00:23:07,877
or however it is possible in Sahaja, like meditation, worship, etc.

282
00:23:08,078 --> 00:23:12,246
you should do all that and establish individually

283
00:23:12,447 --> 00:23:16,960
within you, a special type of state

284
00:23:19,354 --> 00:23:23,084
which we call as

285
00:23:23,719 --> 00:23:26,666
individuality or as totality.

286
00:23:26,867 --> 00:23:28,224
Once you are established individually,

287
00:23:28,425 --> 00:23:30,949
then you can become a collective person.

288
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:32,761
Those who do not attend collectivity,

289
00:23:33,149 --> 00:23:36,769
they cannot also grow individually.

290
00:23:37,176 --> 00:23:38,602
This I have seen.

291
00:23:38,856 --> 00:23:42,872
Only those who attend the collectivity, raise higher.

292
00:23:43,647 --> 00:23:47,376
For some time maybe you’ll get some benefits,

293
00:23:47,528 --> 00:23:50,536
like you get some money, or fame or something.

294
00:23:50,847 --> 00:23:54,887
Especially in Sahja Yoga some people have this ambitions –‚

295
00:23:55,047 --> 00:23:57,792
that ’how many people can I control’.

296
00:23:58,465 --> 00:24:02,790
Even that also happens, but your personality does not improve.

297
00:24:03,492 --> 00:24:05,413
There is no depth in you and

298
00:24:05,977 --> 00:24:10,397
you are not a Sahaja Yogi of high caliber.

299
00:24:10,876 --> 00:24:16,023
Until you are not of high caliber, all your talks are of no use.

300
00:24:16,457 --> 00:24:19,412
Because, who knows when you will fall from the brink

301
00:24:19,508 --> 00:24:22,676
and who knows when you will be destroyed completely?

302
00:24:22,999 --> 00:24:25,002
That is why we should be cautious

303
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:29,676
and try to achieve high spiritual personality.

304
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:33,700
There is one more thing you should do.

305
00:24:34,045 --> 00:24:36,703
If you have got your Realization today,

306
00:24:36,973 --> 00:24:38,659
then ’tomorrow’ you give Realization to thousands of people.

307
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:41,079
Then your Powers will increase.

308
00:24:41,297 --> 00:24:45,486
If not, whatever little you have achieved, will also be finished.

309
00:24:46,689 --> 00:24:50,689
This is a very peculier rule.

310
00:24:51,451 --> 00:24:55,006
It cannot be compared with anything else.

311
00:24:55,278 --> 00:24:59,615
Like, if one lam enlightened and from that another is enlightened;

312
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,858
even then you cannot say that the

313
00:25:03,953 --> 00:25:06,635
light of the first lamp increases –can not say.

314
00:25:06,927 --> 00:25:11,634
But in Sahaja Yoga I have seen, that if anyone opens his heart

315
00:25:11,955 --> 00:25:16,288
and sincerely does Sahaja Yoga

316
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:19,663
and not only that but gives Realization to others, he shines.

317
00:25:20,259 --> 00:25:23,425
Because you have been made a Sahaja Yogi

318
00:25:23,656 --> 00:25:26,703
so that you tranform the entire world.

319
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:33,055
That you create a great wave of transformation in the world

320
00:25:33,634 --> 00:25:37,840
and make it a beautiful place.

321
00:25:38,385 --> 00:25:43,876
The world should become a new and special world

322
00:25:44,678 --> 00:25:48,606
this should be one of your pure desires.

323
00:25:49,403 --> 00:25:53,438
Once you have this pure desire, your Kundalini becomes activated.

324
00:25:53,807 --> 00:25:56,529
I have seen that even very simple, normal people,

325
00:25:56,839 --> 00:25:59,883
when they narrate their experiences, I am surprised-

326
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:02,644
how did such a thing happen to them?

327
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:05,994
How did they give such a suggestion?

328
00:26:06,887 --> 00:26:11,767
In Sahaja Yoga also there are some people, who come for power.

329
00:26:12,697 --> 00:26:14,887
Some come for money.

330
00:26:15,877 --> 00:26:20,040
With all these things, the personality of a person is not developed.

331
00:26:20,333 --> 00:26:22,730
There is no glow in their personality.

332
00:26:23,015 --> 00:26:26,914
Because, the light that you have received;

333
00:26:27,374 --> 00:26:30,095
till the time you do not  share it with others;

334
00:26:30,453 --> 00:26:34,984
and within yourself also if you will not be enlightened,

335
00:26:35,289 --> 00:26:38,400
till then no effort will have any success.

336
00:26:39,364 --> 00:26:43,172
Which is to say that our only work is to change the world;

337
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:44,878
to transform the world.

338
00:26:45,053 --> 00:26:49,021
We have to build a special world and you are special people.

339
00:26:49,644 --> 00:26:54,080
When you begin to understand how important you are,

340
00:26:54,334 --> 00:26:59,319
then with that understanding, you will make your life beautiful.

341
00:27:02,804 --> 00:27:04,793
Have spoken in English,

342
00:27:04,994 --> 00:27:07,934
and spoken in Hindi.

343
00:27:08,135 --> 00:27:11,756
There are so many Maharashtrian’s here

344
00:27:11,957 --> 00:27:14,764
that I should speak in Marathi too.

345
00:27:14,965 --> 00:27:16,731
But it is My wish

346
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:21,187
that all the Sahaja Yogis who live in Maharashtra

347
00:27:21,388 --> 00:27:23,832
should at least learn the Hindi language,

348
00:27:24,033 --> 00:27:26,399
as it is our National language.

349
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:33,263
We should love and be ready, if required be ready

350
00:27:33,464 --> 00:27:35,846
to sacrifice anything for our Nation.

351
00:27:36,047 --> 00:27:37,565
People were always ready to do that.

352
00:27:37,766 --> 00:27:39,682
This was the speciality of Maharashtra.

353
00:27:39,883 --> 00:27:42,455
Now the Maharashtra state, which I see,

354
00:27:42,673 --> 00:27:46,262
I don’t understand, where those people have gone.

355
00:27:46,463 --> 00:27:49,849
They took to the Gods and started doing their puja.

356
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:55,993
After this was done and didn’t work out, they used another way;

357
00:27:56,194 --> 00:27:58,723
they have started going to this guru, that guru,

358
00:27:58,924 --> 00:28:02,683
then going to temples and all that.

359
00:28:02,884 --> 00:28:06,337
We should see what these people have achieved by doing this

360
00:28:06,538 --> 00:28:09,809
what was their benefit,

361
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:13,127
and what you have achieved by doing Sahaja Yoga.

362
00:28:13,328 --> 00:28:15,357
So now just leave and forget everything

363
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:19,951
and dedicate sincerely to yourselves

364
00:28:20,152 --> 00:28:24,605
and make your Kundalini to be in perfect state

365
00:28:24,806 --> 00:28:28,400
and through that you can do a tremendous work.

366
00:28:28,601 --> 00:28:34,692
Now, If I say, I am by birth Maharashtrian,

367
00:28:34,893 --> 00:28:38,778
it is very sad for Me to see

368
00:28:39,322 --> 00:28:41,792
that the Sahaja Yoga has spread in north India,

369
00:28:41,993 --> 00:28:46,154
though I have hardly made any effort there,

370
00:28:46,355 --> 00:28:50,428
but it has spread like fire in north India,

371
00:28:50,793 --> 00:28:54,872
which is very surprising.

372
00:28:56,273 --> 00:28:59,029
Why it has not worked out in Maharashtra?

373
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:03,023
Sahaja Yoga has spread in all big and small villages of Maharashtra.

374
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:08,932
One day a man had come to work at My place.

375
00:29:09,664 --> 00:29:12,231
He bowed down to Me and did namaskar

376
00:29:12,438 --> 00:29:14,133
 so I asked him, “What happened?”

377
00:29:14,334 --> 00:29:19,119
He told Me: „Mataji Your photo is in every big and small villages,

378
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:22,935
Your disciples are there in all our villages”.

379
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:25,641
„How can that be?” - I asked.

380
00:29:25,842 --> 00:29:29,741
All of them say: "we are Sahaja Yogis, don’t tell us anything else".

381
00:29:29,942 --> 00:29:33,426
I was wondering how this happened and with whose blessings?

382
00:29:33,583 --> 00:29:38,079
As I was thinking nothing would work in this country,

383
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:41,202
as too many people are superficial.

384
00:29:41,403 --> 00:29:43,863
But people of Maharashtra are very deep-rooted,

385
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:46,878
the knowledge they have about everything is  deep-rooted,

386
00:29:47,079 --> 00:29:49,864
but, I don’t know where it has gone.

387
00:29:50,065 --> 00:29:51,458
I have always said

388
00:29:51,659 --> 00:29:55,447
that Sahaja Yogis should come in the collective minimum of minimum,

389
00:29:55,648 --> 00:29:59,679
and maximum of maximum give Realization to thousands of people.

390
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,515
Every day we should only think

391
00:30:01,716 --> 00:30:04,549
how many people did we give Realization to,

392
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:07,092
how many people

393
00:30:09,806 --> 00:30:12,362
did we awaken the Kundalini to.

394
00:30:12,563 --> 00:30:17,322
You have a job to save the entire world,

395
00:30:17,523 --> 00:30:21,211
as the Kundalini of the world is established in Maharashtra,

396
00:30:21,412 --> 00:30:23,409
and we have eight Ganeshas in Maharashtra,

397
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:27,575
and three and a half Goddesses are manifested here.

398
00:30:27,776 --> 00:30:30,860
All the arrangements are done here,

399
00:30:31,061 --> 00:30:34,624
but, surprisingly, people do not take interest in that.

400
00:30:34,825 --> 00:30:37,169
People are so false, pretending to be what they are not,

401
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:43,448
and waste time doing  mundane things.

402
00:30:44,403 --> 00:30:48,666
Instead of doing this, try to achieve the truth.

403
00:30:48,867 --> 00:30:50,819
Pay attention to the truth.

404
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:54,449
Under any mythical ideea, if you try to do something good

405
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:56,660
what are you going to achieve?

406
00:30:56,861 --> 00:30:58,808
If you don't change from within,

407
00:30:59,009 --> 00:31:01,642
you cannot achieve anything.

408
00:31:01,843 --> 00:31:08,606
The innate growth should be so deep and mature,

409
00:31:08,807 --> 00:31:13,341
that its fragrance should spread all over the world.

410
00:31:13,542 --> 00:31:17,893
Insted of that we get involved in petty things

411
00:31:18,094 --> 00:31:20,192
and fight among ourselves.

412
00:31:20,393 --> 00:31:22,019
This all should stop.

413
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:25,718
Instead of that, I see

414
00:31:25,909 --> 00:31:29,556
that Yuva Shakti activities are very good.

415
00:31:29,757 --> 00:31:37,108
Due to yuvashakti the whole of Maharashtra will change.

416
00:31:37,309 --> 00:31:41,566
People who are highly placed,

417
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:46,317
who are sitting in high positions,

418
00:31:46,518 --> 00:31:49,980
are very arrogant, terribly arrogant.

419
00:31:50,181 --> 00:31:53,637
It is very surprising from where they have got this arrogance.

420
00:31:53,838 --> 00:31:59,400
I fail to understand the reason for this arrogance.

421
00:31:59,601 --> 00:32:01,783
Because of this arrogance,

422
00:32:01,984 --> 00:32:07,658
we were not able to do any special Sahaja Yoga work in Maharashtra.

423
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:13,055
So, it should be your aim to spread Sahaja Yoga

424
00:32:13,256 --> 00:32:16,911
and to establish people in Sahaja Yoga.

425
00:32:17,153 --> 00:32:20,685
Today is a very special day, the day of Shivratri.

426
00:32:20,886 --> 00:32:23,695
We should all take a pledge,

427
00:32:23,896 --> 00:32:27,248
and pledge to Shri Shiva to get His blessings.

428
00:32:27,449 --> 00:32:30,389
Due to His bliss in your heart,

429
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:34,626
you will be surprised

430
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:38,664
there will be flow of joy and flow of love.

431
00:32:38,865 --> 00:32:43,451
First of all, you get ready for that.

432
00:32:44,733 --> 00:32:47,335
You have light in our heart.

433
00:32:47,536 --> 00:32:50,449
This light if we do not spread,

434
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:54,802
then we will be in darkness, along with others.

435
00:32:55,028 --> 00:32:57,385
So, we should all decide

436
00:32:57,586 --> 00:33:05,321
that we will give Realization to at least 100 people till next year.

437
00:33:05,522 --> 00:33:08,377
I know that if we go and speak to people about Sahaja Yoga,

438
00:33:08,578 --> 00:33:11,209
they won't agree, that is the issue.

439
00:33:11,410 --> 00:33:14,569
They think are over smart but don't have any common sense.

440
00:33:14,770 --> 00:33:17,810
But still if you explain them

441
00:33:18,011 --> 00:33:21,454
what you have gained and what you have benefitted,

442
00:33:21,667 --> 00:33:24,939
what you achieved and what you are still to achieve,

443
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:28,420
then people may start believing you.

444
00:33:28,694 --> 00:33:30,318
They will trust that

445
00:33:30,519 --> 00:33:35,708
and they will gradually stop their wrong doings.

446
00:33:35,909 --> 00:33:37,801
This is our main responsibility.

447
00:33:38,002 --> 00:33:44,700
For this, you all have to think properly and should act accordingly.

448
00:33:44,901 --> 00:33:46,324
If this does not happen

449
00:33:46,525 --> 00:33:49,540
then I am not sure in what condition will be Maharashtra.

450
00:33:49,741 --> 00:33:53,645
Shivaji Maharaj has worked so hard for this state.

451
00:33:53,846 --> 00:33:58,476
There have been many saints in Maharashtra, unlike anywhere else,

452
00:33:58,677 --> 00:34:01,751
who have shed their blood

453
00:34:01,926 --> 00:34:04,701
for this great and holy land!

454
00:34:04,923 --> 00:34:06,848
That is why it is called Maharashtra.

455
00:34:07,023 --> 00:34:10,742
You should not fight for petty things,

456
00:34:10,943 --> 00:34:13,069
you should not live like petty people.

457
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:17,184
There is no point, because you people are Realized souls now.

458
00:34:17,385 --> 00:34:20,859
Earlier, there were no Realized souls, but they were land soldiers.

459
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,997
I fail to understand this,

460
00:34:23,198 --> 00:34:27,310
where these people have gone, the people from the royal community.

461
00:34:27,511 --> 00:34:29,478
People who never used to touch alcohol,

462
00:34:29,693 --> 00:34:32,760
are now drinking senselessly.

463
00:34:32,961 --> 00:34:36,185
Under this nonsense they are destroying themselves

464
00:34:36,376 --> 00:34:39,408
and are going away from Shiva.

465
00:34:40,873 --> 00:34:47,447
That is why people have said that God has taken lots of effort.

466
00:34:48,649 --> 00:34:50,474
Everything is done,

467
00:34:50,675 --> 00:34:55,044
but if you are facing the wrong direction then how it will work?

468
00:34:55,245 --> 00:34:58,288
Now you should explain it to people,

469
00:34:59,513 --> 00:35:01,692
from all your heart,

470
00:35:01,893 --> 00:35:07,650
and this is what I am telling you, in this Shiva puja.

471
00:35:07,851 --> 00:35:10,165
If Shiva gets angry,

472
00:35:10,396 --> 00:35:13,848
then He will be angry on Maharashtra first,

473
00:35:14,049 --> 00:35:16,836
as this is a special place for Him.

474
00:35:17,037 --> 00:35:20,845
You know how much people believe in Shiva,

475
00:35:21,046 --> 00:35:24,617
and you know whom Shri Shiva is worshiping first.

476
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:27,653
For everybody in Maharashtra the first worshipped deity

477
00:35:27,854 --> 00:35:29,182
is Shri Ganesha.

478
00:35:29,383 --> 00:35:32,916
And if He gets disturbed then I am not sure what will happen.

479
00:35:33,117 --> 00:35:37,703
I don’t know when all this iniquity started in Maharashtra,

480
00:35:37,904 --> 00:35:45,317
and I am seeing what people are doing with Shri Ganesha’s idol.

481
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:47,577
He is Shri Ganesha -

482
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:51,991
if you insult Him, if you disrespect Him,

483
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:55,919
then what will happen to you and who will save you?.

484
00:35:56,741 --> 00:36:02,266
So, you need to tell the people that they should get Realization

485
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:04,573
and they should join Sahaja Yoga,

486
00:36:04,764 --> 00:36:07,072
and get their Kundalini awakened.

487
00:36:07,273 --> 00:36:09,159
Everybody is aware of it,

488
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,614
right from Marchrindra Nath to Gorakh Nath,

489
00:36:11,805 --> 00:36:13,832
everyone has worked on it.

490
00:36:14,033 --> 00:36:16,086
Everyone has knowledge about it,

491
00:36:16,285 --> 00:36:19,330
and everybody knows that Kundalini has to be awakened.

492
00:36:19,531 --> 00:36:22,310
And in Marathi there are books about Kundalini,

493
00:36:22,511 --> 00:36:26,339
but the knowledge of books has remained within the books.

494
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:29,813
But you should clearly explain about it to people:

495
00:36:30,014 --> 00:36:34,961
„Look, this is the time for you to get your resurection”.

496
00:36:35,162 --> 00:36:38,780
You should get ready for it.

497
00:36:38,981 --> 00:36:43,027
On this auspicious occasion of Shivratri,

498
00:36:43,228 --> 00:36:46,347
we should all decide

499
00:36:46,548 --> 00:36:51,443
that we will spread Sahaja Yoga in tremendous way.

500
00:36:51,644 --> 00:36:56,589
That is of utmost importance and nothing is beyond it in our life.

501
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:59,884
All your work will be taken care of,

502
00:37:00,075 --> 00:37:02,406
if you practice Sahaja Yoga.

503
00:37:02,607 --> 00:37:03,787
You should meditate.

504
00:37:03,988 --> 00:37:08,006
If you don't meditate what is the point in being in Sahaja Yoga?

505
00:37:08,207 --> 00:37:12,761
Just coming here, singing and all and then going away,

506
00:37:12,962 --> 00:37:15,483
what is the meaning of it?

507
00:37:16,684 --> 00:37:21,234
The main thing is you should feel the Self within,

508
00:37:21,435 --> 00:37:23,424
the transformation in your personality.

509
00:37:23,625 --> 00:37:27,858
That will make you feel so happy

510
00:37:28,033 --> 00:37:31,010
and so proud of yourself.

511
00:37:31,211 --> 00:37:33,924
You will feel: „What we could do now?

512
00:37:34,155 --> 00:37:38,010
It is a very huge task, which should be done by you.

513
00:37:38,211 --> 00:37:43,200
On this auspicious occasion I am telling you,

514
00:37:43,401 --> 00:37:45,913
if you want to please Shri Shiva,

515
00:37:46,114 --> 00:37:49,273
you give Realization to a lot of people.

516
00:37:49,448 --> 00:37:52,463
It means Kundalini is His Shakti.

517
00:37:52,664 --> 00:37:55,487
So you should awaken their Kundalini,

518
00:37:55,688 --> 00:37:59,370
instead of wasting time unnecessarily on unimportant things.

519
00:37:59,571 --> 00:38:02,493
So have your attention on Kundalini awakening.

520
00:38:02,694 --> 00:38:05,382
By doing this, you will change the Maharashtra completely.

521
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:10,076
There are few people who are creating problems,

522
00:38:10,258 --> 00:38:12,051
but they will get destroyed.

523
00:38:12,252 --> 00:38:14,550
First of all, you should give realization to others,

524
00:38:14,751 --> 00:38:20,562
it is important to give it to as many people as possible.

525
00:38:20,763 --> 00:38:22,838
This is your duty.

526
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:25,834
Now, this is Shri Shiva puja,

527
00:38:26,035 --> 00:38:27,790
so during his Puja,

528
00:38:27,991 --> 00:38:31,509
establish Shri Shiva in your heart,

529
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:34,644
so that you will never have problems.

530
00:38:34,845 --> 00:38:37,317
You have to keep Shri Shiva in your heart,

531
00:38:37,518 --> 00:38:40,343
so that when the kundalini is awakened,

532
00:38:40,544 --> 00:38:43,460
you become one with Him.

533
00:38:43,661 --> 00:38:48,931
This transformation takes place because of the light of Shri Shiva,

534
00:38:49,146 --> 00:38:50,911
as He is the Spirit.

535
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:54,858
He is the reflection of Atma in our heart.

536
00:38:55,059 --> 00:38:59,136
So, in this state of reflection,

537
00:38:59,339 --> 00:39:01,964
you look in your heart, asking yourself:

538
00:39:02,165 --> 00:39:05,859
"Why are you lying and making a fool of yourself?".

539
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:08,873
introspect youeself from within,

540
00:39:09,074 --> 00:39:13,584
I have tried explaining this to people - they just don’t understand.

541
00:39:13,785 --> 00:39:18,013
They say: "Mother, we heard this lecture today, other another day".

542
00:39:18,214 --> 00:39:20,322
Listening my lectures won’t help you.

543
00:39:20,523 --> 00:39:22,954
If you want to help yourself,

544
00:39:23,155 --> 00:39:27,409
you will have to establish in Sahaja Yoga with full dedication.

545
00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:32,551
This is My request to you all, a request with all My love.

546
00:39:32,752 --> 00:39:36,053
May God bless you all.
