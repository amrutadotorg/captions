00:07:46.857 --> 00:07:49.746
The prophets are born

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:57.502
and create a ripple in our consciousness,

00:07:59.316 --> 00:08:06.413
a new dimension to our understanding

00:08:06.743 --> 00:08:10.559
to religion, dharma;

00:08:11.962 --> 00:08:14.862
which has to be assimilated

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:18.035
and has to be understood that,

00:08:18.263 --> 00:08:21.002
whatever the previous prophets have said,

00:08:21.325 --> 00:08:26.208
has to be culminated into something else.

00:08:28.873 --> 00:08:31.383
So as we can say Mohammed Sahib

00:08:34.068 --> 00:08:36.864
has said that all these prophets

00:08:37.471 --> 00:08:40.986
who have come on this earth have created

00:08:44.183 --> 00:08:49.600
a new ripple and also has sustained human beings

00:08:50.245 --> 00:08:56.077
with a newer evolution, a newer...

00:08:58.190 --> 00:09:01.209
The idea of human beings of newness is that

00:09:01.834 --> 00:09:04.183
we have to give up all that is old

00:09:04.898 --> 00:09:06.667
and we have to become new.

00:09:07.924 --> 00:09:12.889
Or they think that newness means absolutely a juxtaposition

00:09:13.435 --> 00:09:16.518
condition in which one has to rise

00:09:18.052 --> 00:09:22.039
and this is the cause of the folly

00:09:22.327 --> 00:09:25.822
of many people in the West as well as in the East.

00:09:27.056 --> 00:09:34.726
Whenever a new theme started, like we can say that first of all

00:09:37.277 --> 00:09:40.212
a great saint came on this earth

00:09:40.705 --> 00:09:45.352
and he found that the people are following

00:09:45.702 --> 00:09:48.869
the idol worship in a very wrong way,

00:09:49.196 --> 00:09:53.905
because it is said in the bible that whatever is created by mother earth

00:09:55.740 --> 00:10:02.740
should be, should not be reproduced and worshipped.

00:10:04.185 --> 00:10:09.153
So they created another extreme religion out of it

00:10:09.207 --> 00:10:12.356
saying that nothing should be worshipped, but it is said whatever is

00:10:12.548 --> 00:10:14.840
reproduced by the mother earth.

00:10:16.356 --> 00:10:20.077
So there are so many such things all over the world

00:10:20.582 --> 00:10:23.644
which are created by the mother earth.

00:10:24.825 --> 00:10:26.718
So they should not be worshipped

00:10:27.269 --> 00:10:31.792
by reproducing them and making images out of them.

00:10:34.643 --> 00:10:37.442
When such a prophet died

00:10:37.893 --> 00:10:41.817
saying that, "This should not be done, one should not worship images",

00:10:43.449 --> 00:10:47.408
the other side of it started, the extreme, going to the extreme that

00:10:47.749 --> 00:10:52.836
there should be no worship even if the mother earth has created.

00:10:54.970 --> 00:11:01.024
So all the human beings were divided into extreme conditions.

00:11:02.684 --> 00:11:04.498
One situation comes in

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:07.788
where one has to say that, "This should not be done."

00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:14.515
So people take up that theme and just start building up onto that

00:11:15.496 --> 00:11:20.486
and saying that: "this should not be done as told by the prophet."

00:11:21.706 --> 00:11:23.624
Of course after the death of the prophet;

00:11:23.698 --> 00:11:26.554
when the prophet is living nobody listens to him.

00:11:26.575 --> 00:11:28.916
They all torture him, bother him,

00:11:29.563 --> 00:11:32.153
do all kinds of things and ultimately they may even kill him.

00:11:34.322 --> 00:11:36.666
Then another point is: every prophet

00:11:38.167 --> 00:11:40.811
is born at a different period of time

00:11:41.415 --> 00:11:48.541
so depending on the time when he is born he talks of a particular problem.

00:11:49.979 --> 00:11:52.482
Say when Mohammed was born.

00:11:53.304 --> 00:11:58.261
Mohammed Sahib said very clearly that, "You should not drink."

00:12:00.455 --> 00:12:05.238
So people said that, "All right, we will not drink, but we can smoke."

00:12:07.188 --> 00:12:09.188
So he had to rectify himself.

00:12:09.635 --> 00:12:13.643
He'd said: 'I am the last who has come.' but he found that it is not so.

00:12:14.451 --> 00:12:16.475
So he came back again as Nanaka

00:12:17.494 --> 00:12:20.347
to tell people that: 'do not smoke also'.

00:12:22.825 --> 00:12:29.825
Like that the persons or the group of persons who follow one incarnation

00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:32.540
go to another extreme

00:12:33.999 --> 00:12:36.466
and try to push down all the traditions,

00:12:36.969 --> 00:12:41.555
all that has come so far built up. Like cutting the whole tree

00:12:42.204 --> 00:12:44.204
and start their own tree.

00:12:44.576 --> 00:12:45.702
Which is artificial.

00:12:49.462 --> 00:12:50.973
Then the quarrel started

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:54.638
when Mohammed Sahib was driven to another

00:12:55.437 --> 00:12:59.506
level and then Nanaka's disciples were driven to

00:12:59.538 --> 00:13:01.455
another level, where they just thought

00:13:01.972 --> 00:13:04.767
they have no relationship with each other. Which is not truth.

00:13:09.322 --> 00:13:13.137
Afterwards also you know so many such things have happened

00:13:13.168 --> 00:13:14.399
in this world we can see

00:13:14.871 --> 00:13:16.954
that any revival starts,

00:13:18.511 --> 00:13:20.511
people go to the extreme of it

00:13:20.871 --> 00:13:22.871
and get completely ruined.

00:13:24.829 --> 00:13:27.660
In Christianity you will find the same thing happened,

00:13:28.086 --> 00:13:29.699
when Christ came in,

00:13:30.068 --> 00:13:32.543
whatever problems He faced He talked about them.

00:13:33.582 --> 00:13:36.569
But the main thing He had to talk about the resurrection,

00:13:37.031 --> 00:13:41.110
about the ascent and He talked about the ascent.

00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:43.329
He talked about the spirit

00:13:43.405 --> 00:13:46.181
and in His resurrection He showed that He ascended.

00:13:48.731 --> 00:13:52.557
But people did not stick to that point.

00:13:53.908 --> 00:13:56.489
They never thought that you have to ascend in Christianity.

00:13:57.665 --> 00:14:01.940
Nobody bothered that you have to ascend. They took a  small little

00:14:02.255 --> 00:14:03.486
things from somewhere.

00:14:03.813 --> 00:14:07.213
Also a person came later on

00:14:07.621 --> 00:14:11.756
called saint Paul who was not at all with Christ or anything.

00:14:11.798 --> 00:14:14.019
He started a religion of Christianity

00:14:14.145 --> 00:14:16.437
which was all absurd, against Christ, anti-Christ.

00:14:20.389 --> 00:14:25.099
None of these prophets have discarded any prophet who came before them.

00:14:28.465 --> 00:14:32.650
Now the problem came in that one has to integrate

00:14:36.722 --> 00:14:38.058
and Mohammed Sahib knew

00:14:38.368 --> 00:14:41.413
that a day will come when this integration problem will start

00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:45.173
and he talked a lot about Sahaja Yoga in the sense

00:14:45.170 --> 00:14:47.170
he said when the resurrection time will come.

00:14:47.369 --> 00:14:50.345
He talked more about resurrection than about doom time,

00:14:50.406 --> 00:14:51.400
most surprising thing is.

00:14:52.208 --> 00:14:56.468
About Kyama he spoke very little. He spoke really about

00:14:59.891 --> 00:15:03.326
the resurrection time, because that was the problem.

00:15:04.277 --> 00:15:06.363
The problem that they face they talk about.

00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:08.805
I've told you how Buddha talked

00:15:08.850 --> 00:15:10.562
only about Atma Sakshatkar

00:15:10.657 --> 00:15:13.420
and not about God because those people who went to God,

00:15:14.057 --> 00:15:15.317
or thought of God,

00:15:15.612 --> 00:15:19.696
or just studied God thought they will be gods themselves.

00:15:20.971 --> 00:15:22.910
So he said, "You must get your self realization."

00:15:23.685 --> 00:15:27.809
Then Mahavira who talked about the hell

00:15:28.694 --> 00:15:30.161
where people can go,

00:15:30.849 --> 00:15:31.982
because that was his job,

00:15:32.035 --> 00:15:35.300
the part of it and the part of it and the part of it and the part of it.

00:15:35.834 --> 00:15:38.320
These are the different aspects of human beings

00:15:39.065 --> 00:15:42.535
which they had to awaken. Different aspects.

00:15:46.749 --> 00:15:49.467
When Mohammed Sahib started teaching people to do Namas

00:15:49.514 --> 00:15:50.547
people used to laugh at him.

00:15:50.654 --> 00:15:53.422
What is he doing? Why does he want us to put hands like this?

00:15:53.717 --> 00:15:57.928
Why does he want us to sit down or put our hands on the knees?

00:15:58.512 --> 00:16:02.093
Now you understand as Sahaja Yogis what it means that he wanted us to

00:16:02.247 --> 00:16:04.422
improve our nabhis first, our dharma first.

00:16:05.789 --> 00:16:08.231
All this movement was to jerk out

00:16:08.348 --> 00:16:12.111
the Kundalini, but without realization being there

00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:13.503
Namas would not work out.

00:16:14.435 --> 00:16:16.509
You may break your knees you may do what you like.

00:16:18.686 --> 00:16:22.464
But the extremes people catch hold of it and not the reality.

00:16:23.097 --> 00:16:26.537
And they make a fuss out of it and they make create a big

00:16:27.807 --> 00:16:30.123
organizations and things and that's how it is spoiled.

00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:32.402
So when he said

00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:35.203
that Allah ho Akbar is to be said with your

00:16:35.277 --> 00:16:37.395
fingers in your ears you all say that isn't it?

00:16:38.124 --> 00:16:42.199
All the Sahaja Yogis say with this finger in their ears Allah ho Akbar.

00:16:42.861 --> 00:16:46.042
Because you know this is the finger that represents thevishuddi

00:16:46.914 --> 00:16:48.836
and the vishuddi chakras'

00:16:49.546 --> 00:16:52.953
deity Shri Krishna becomes the Virata with Akbar.

00:16:53.134 --> 00:16:54.700
So when you say about Akbar

00:16:54.819 --> 00:16:57.511
you have to put your fingers into your ears

00:16:57.668 --> 00:16:59.668
and you have to say Allah ho Akbar.

00:17:02.249 --> 00:17:04.543
Whole relationship and everything

00:17:04.981 --> 00:17:06.981
was never understood.

00:17:07.266 --> 00:17:10.722
For Indians Shri Krishna was their Omkara.

00:17:11.747 --> 00:17:15.974
For western people Christ was their Omkara.

00:17:16.228 --> 00:17:22.347
For other people of Arabistan Mohammed was their Omkara. How can that be?

00:17:23.158 --> 00:17:24.751
They are all related to each other.

00:17:25.722 --> 00:17:30.027
So how to related to each other is a problem of Sahaja Yoga.

00:17:31.578 --> 00:17:37.903
When they come from different communities and different fixed ideas

00:17:38.555 --> 00:17:42.018
it's impossible to stir them and tell them that, "You are all one."

00:17:43.684 --> 00:17:48.241
We talk of Hindu Muslim unity for example. Mohammed Sahib

00:17:48.561 --> 00:17:51.590
didn't know there were problems like that

00:17:51.791 --> 00:17:55.414
but Nanaka did say we have come to do Hindu Muslim unity.

00:17:55.944 --> 00:17:59.974
But in the outside if you do the Hindu Muslim unity or any unity,

00:18:00.312 --> 00:18:04.805
it doesn't work out. It doesn't work out in the outside relationship.

00:18:04.925 --> 00:18:07.238
Even your brother may not be your own brother,

00:18:08.062 --> 00:18:10.216
if it is working outside.

00:18:11.878 --> 00:18:15.463
But if the spirit is awakened within you,

00:18:16.731 --> 00:18:19.875
then spirit is the one which is the connection with the whole

00:18:19.931 --> 00:18:20.668
with the Virata.

00:18:23.445 --> 00:18:25.445
With the Akbar.

00:18:26.102 --> 00:18:31.684
When Akbar is to be felt

00:18:33.125 --> 00:18:35.551
you have to have your realization otherwise

00:18:35.741 --> 00:18:37.225
you are just talking in the air.

00:18:38.037 --> 00:18:39.958
You don't know who is this Akbar.

00:18:41.447 --> 00:18:44.114
You have to get connected to that Virata

00:18:44.959 --> 00:18:47.806
and that Virata is the Primordial Being.

00:18:51.219 --> 00:18:52.043
We are

00:18:52.155 --> 00:18:56.113
actually not integrated at all because we have different incarnations.

00:18:56.192 --> 00:18:58.904
Even if you are not absolutely atheist,

00:18:59.026 --> 00:19:03.719
even if you don't say that you do not believe in God or believe

00:19:03.757 --> 00:19:06.564
in something else which is anti-God.

00:19:07.428 --> 00:19:10.653
Even if you believe in God, you believe in God

00:19:10.711 --> 00:19:14.215
in fragmentations, in His different aspects,

00:19:14.579 --> 00:19:16.965
but you don't see Him in collectivity.

00:19:18.935 --> 00:19:23.221
You have to see that He is one God. Everybody says He is one God.

00:19:24.109 --> 00:19:26.109
Of course He is one God.

00:19:26.325 --> 00:19:29.617
I am one person but I am also a housewife,

00:19:29.937 --> 00:19:32.633
I have to do some work for My household.

00:19:33.058 --> 00:19:35.124
I am also a sister of somebody.

00:19:35.463 --> 00:19:37.019
I am also your Mother

00:19:37.083 --> 00:19:39.673
and Mother of My own children and also a grandmother.

00:19:40.906 --> 00:19:44.462
So I have so many various aspects of My work

00:19:44.608 --> 00:19:46.712
which I do. One person has to do it.

00:19:47.446 --> 00:19:50.767
When we talk of God as One we think He is Rock of Gibraltar;

00:19:51.070 --> 00:19:53.771
just one piece. Even Rock of Gibraltar if you go and see

00:19:53.974 --> 00:19:54.998
it is not one piece.

00:19:57.931 --> 00:20:01.963
Anything in this world you cannot say is one piece.

00:20:05.067 --> 00:20:10.334
It has to be a compound or a mixture of something.

00:20:11.376 --> 00:20:15.551
Then how can God be just one piece hanging in the air like one,

00:20:15.583 --> 00:20:19.148
God is One, so we'll not have any other aspect of God.

00:20:19.854 --> 00:20:22.950
God has many aspects, which one has to understand.

00:20:23.723 --> 00:20:25.723
So there are two concepts

00:20:26.048 --> 00:20:28.108
which work out in this world I feel.

00:20:28.339 --> 00:20:32.141
One is that they believe that there is only one God

00:20:32.762 --> 00:20:37.889
and there cannot be many aspects of God. Which is wrong.

00:20:39.153 --> 00:20:42.779
Christ has said: 'those who are not against Me are with Me.'

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:46.895
So this kind of a mental conception about God,

00:20:46.985 --> 00:20:48.852
that He is just like Rock of Gibraltar.

00:20:48.976 --> 00:20:52.048
See now this pendal you have done it - there are so many lights,

00:20:52.591 --> 00:20:54.913
they are all giving one light to all of us.

00:20:54.939 --> 00:20:56.531
They are not giving separate lights, are they?

00:21:00.445 --> 00:21:03.726
How are they fighting with each other?

00:21:04.683 --> 00:21:08.216
What is the fight going on? They are adding to the same light.

00:21:09.277 --> 00:21:12.672
This is one pendal but we have so many lights.

00:21:13.056 --> 00:21:14.573
We cannot do with one light.

00:21:14.827 --> 00:21:18.513
At different periods a person has to be born.

00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:22.760
Every period a person had to be born to

00:21:24.215 --> 00:21:28.726
enlighten one aspect of human awareness and consciousness.

00:21:32.285 --> 00:21:35.646
Variety has to be there

00:21:36.176 --> 00:21:38.461
because human beings are varied.

00:21:40.254 --> 00:21:43.354
And the variety is that supposing you are supporting

00:21:43.426 --> 00:21:47.051
somebody's right sidedness

00:21:47.531 --> 00:21:50.881
then there should be somebody who will come and support the left sidedness.

00:21:52.342 --> 00:21:54.679
And it is all done so well within us but

00:21:54.732 --> 00:21:57.222
it is only human beings in their obstinacy

00:21:57.227 --> 00:21:59.227
and in their ignorance cannot see it.

00:22:02.483 --> 00:22:05.461
We all are made the same way if you see in the whole world.

00:22:06.773 --> 00:22:08.957
Of course there is variety in appearances.

00:22:08.966 --> 00:22:10.966
Maybe an Indian looks like an Indian

00:22:11.172 --> 00:22:15.680
and - but in India only you can see Indians have so many different faces.

00:22:17.096 --> 00:22:19.430
You can find all colors and all kinds of

00:22:19.652 --> 00:22:21.138
things on their faces.

00:22:21.241 --> 00:22:24.602
In India is the only place where you find all kinds of people.

00:22:26.892 --> 00:22:29.115
You can have people like Russians,

00:22:29.154 --> 00:22:32.234
you can have people like Japanese, Chinese,

00:22:32.317 --> 00:22:35.827
you can have people like Africans. All kinds of people are

00:22:36.023 --> 00:22:37.817
in this country to show that

00:22:37.894 --> 00:22:40.644
all people can be called as one race as Indians.

00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:49.983
Now it is not always ignorance

00:22:50.227 --> 00:22:53.168
that makes people forget that we are all one.

00:22:53.529 --> 00:22:55.907
Every human being laughs the same way.

00:22:56.705 --> 00:22:58.174
Does he laugh in a different way?

00:23:00.044 --> 00:23:06.245
If he has to eat the food he masticates the same way.

00:23:07.418 --> 00:23:11.728
He cries the same way. When he cries his crying is the same.

00:23:12.492 --> 00:23:14.492
His actions are the same way.

00:23:15.125 --> 00:23:19.546
If a woman is angry with her husband...yesterday I saw [name] program

00:23:20.474 --> 00:23:21.806
with My brother

00:23:22.172 --> 00:23:25.943
and I was amazed how universal we are in our expressions.

00:23:26.895 --> 00:23:28.735
He was showing how a woman gets

00:23:28.801 --> 00:23:30.801
angry with the husband and how she behaves.

00:23:31.462 --> 00:23:34.870
If you see those actions which are depicted you'll be amazed

00:23:35.325 --> 00:23:38.752
that they are done by all the women all over the world.

00:23:39.764 --> 00:23:43.942
And the reaction of man if you want to see all the men

00:23:44.644 --> 00:23:45.764
act in the same way.

00:23:47.726 --> 00:23:51.121
My husband was secretary to Shastriji, you know

00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:54.604
that and he went with Lal Bahadur Shastri

00:23:55.156 --> 00:23:58.549
to Tashkent at his last time,

00:23:58.658 --> 00:24:02.775
but also he went once to Yugoslavia and there

00:24:05.768 --> 00:24:10.577
[aside: who was General Tito was where? Yugoslav]

00:24:11.114 --> 00:24:13.279
And General Tito's wife, you see,

00:24:13.543 --> 00:24:15.411
got very friendly with Mrs. Shastri.

00:24:15.447 --> 00:24:16.636
Both were very friendly.

00:24:17.196 --> 00:24:20.714
So Shastriji warned his wife: 'See now! You are great friends

00:24:21.075 --> 00:24:24.585
and now don't start crying like an Indian woman when you leave.'

00:24:25.558 --> 00:24:28.226
So poor thing was controlling her tears all the time.

00:24:28.994 --> 00:24:32.791
But she told Me: 'I was controlling but it is she who started crying

00:24:33.805 --> 00:24:35.084
and such a lot.

00:24:35.219 --> 00:24:37.931
And then she started crying loudly, hugging me.

00:24:38.208 --> 00:24:39.875
So I just could not control myself.

00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:41.680
I also gave in. I also started crying.

00:24:42.954 --> 00:24:46.188
And both the husbands started looking at the ground.'

00:24:51.747 --> 00:24:54.271
So basically all the women,

00:24:54.421 --> 00:24:58.279
all the men in the whole world react the same way to a situation.

00:24:59.134 --> 00:25:02.192
And you can see their reactions

00:25:02.547 --> 00:25:04.547
very clearly when it comes to children.

00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:09.494
They all act in the same way, act in the same manner.

00:25:09.883 --> 00:25:13.748
Supposing they hear that two children are caught up

00:25:14.173 --> 00:25:17.105
in the air somewhere or something is happening to them.

00:25:17.443 --> 00:25:19.443
The whole world will be worried about

00:25:20.811 --> 00:25:22.600
how they are going to be saved.

00:25:23.569 --> 00:25:25.012
Something must be done to save them.

00:25:25.031 --> 00:25:27.088
The whole world will be praying to God: 'Oh God

00:25:27.102 --> 00:25:29.623
please save these two children are caught up there somehow or other.'

00:25:29.856 --> 00:25:32.218
Everybody will be worried as if their own child is there.

00:25:33.016 --> 00:25:35.426
Even when it comes to death I have seen that.

00:25:35.764 --> 00:25:39.242
When there was a air space -

00:25:39.651 --> 00:25:42.257
the space craft was going to land

00:25:42.489 --> 00:25:45.076
and people were worried that they may be lost,

00:25:45.522 --> 00:25:48.272
I know in every masjid, in every temple,

00:25:48.328 --> 00:25:50.452
in every church and everywhere.

00:25:50.629 --> 00:25:52.973
They were Americans; nobody thought of Americans,

00:25:53.022 --> 00:25:54.054
what religion, anything.

00:25:54.128 --> 00:25:56.721
To them it was a part of human beings, you see.

00:25:57.541 --> 00:25:59.589
The human bondage started acting.

00:25:59.974 --> 00:26:02.383
That time they never thought what country they were,

00:26:02.746 --> 00:26:05.659
what Americans have done to Indians, nothing of the kind.

00:26:06.253 --> 00:26:09.407
They just thought: 'Oh God! These people are, oh God please save them.'

00:26:10.135 --> 00:26:11.781
Everybody prayed to them -

00:26:12.033 --> 00:26:15.139
prayed to God and prayed for them that they should be saved.

00:26:15.567 --> 00:26:18.577
That time what had happened to us? How did we forget?

00:26:18.786 --> 00:26:20.786
We touched to the reality at that time

00:26:24.411 --> 00:26:25.983
and that is what it is.

00:26:28.128 --> 00:26:29.634
Anybody who tries.

00:26:30.152 --> 00:26:34.680
These Jews when they were troubled by Hitler,

00:26:34.942 --> 00:26:36.988
everybody's sympathies were with them.

00:26:38.045 --> 00:26:40.178
But when these Jews started troubling

00:26:40.532 --> 00:26:43.488
the Muslims there everybody's sympathies were with Muslims.

00:26:43.664 --> 00:26:45.241
Then why don't you think all religions?

00:26:45.378 --> 00:26:47.378
Even the Jews had sympathies with Muslims.

00:26:49.276 --> 00:26:52.104
Then we don't think what differences we have with them.

00:26:52.218 --> 00:26:55.138
None of them none of the people I heard said: 'all right

00:26:55.390 --> 00:26:57.616
they are punished.' Or, 'It's all right.' Not even Jews.

00:27:00.433 --> 00:27:03.446
So the part that is within us which is human

00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:08.254
becomes absolutely troubled

00:27:08.466 --> 00:27:11.362
when we see some other human being is tortured.

00:27:12.811 --> 00:27:17.235
Of course by with these horrible ideas of fanaticism

00:27:17.410 --> 00:27:21.484
or maybe fear or maybe aggressiveness or whatever it is,

00:27:22.027 --> 00:27:24.027
we may try to be cruel.

00:27:26.471 --> 00:27:28.743
If you ask the people of Germany

00:27:29.183 --> 00:27:31.183
how do they feel about the massacre,

00:27:31.944 --> 00:27:33.318
they just put down their heads.

00:27:33.357 --> 00:27:35.970
They said: 'we don't know. We were not ourselves.

00:27:36.098 --> 00:27:38.358
How we did it we don't know. How it happened

00:27:38.624 --> 00:27:40.624
we just don't know how it worked out.'

00:27:41.729 --> 00:27:46.455
So when the violence is over you just start feeling: 'Oh God,

00:27:47.124 --> 00:27:53.025
I am a human being, they were human beings.' So this oneness comes in,

00:27:53.799 --> 00:27:58.250
the feeling the awareness comes in. It is not so in the animals so much.

00:27:59.082 --> 00:28:03.514
If they have to work, if they are to be active, they will be together

00:28:03.930 --> 00:28:06.078
but if something dies they are not bothered.

00:28:08.390 --> 00:28:13.666
Even if a child say of a monkey is sick

00:28:13.963 --> 00:28:16.200
the mother will be worried. She'll be screaming,

00:28:16.278 --> 00:28:19.432
shouting, but if the thing is dead she will just

00:28:19.517 --> 00:28:21.517
throw away the child on one side and get up.

00:28:23.212 --> 00:28:26.838
It's only the human beings who can feel that oneness.

00:28:27.463 --> 00:28:31.924
So our awareness... this was given to us by Shri Krishna's advent.

00:28:32.025 --> 00:28:34.025
He gave us this awareness

00:28:35.607 --> 00:28:39.262
of human, or He keeps that awareness within us.

00:28:39.683 --> 00:28:42.413
We have to accept Him as a person

00:28:42.481 --> 00:28:46.575
who gives us this awareness of human relationship.

00:28:50.538 --> 00:28:53.471
And whenever there has been problem

00:28:54.356 --> 00:28:58.185
like somebody told Me that in Somnat people believe

00:28:58.370 --> 00:29:01.127
that Shri Krishna came as

00:29:02.266 --> 00:29:04.266
to give lessons. So many Hindus believe

00:29:05.001 --> 00:29:07.694
it was Shri Krishna who came as Mohammed Kuzni

00:29:07.836 --> 00:29:10.001
to give a lesson to these horrible Brahmins

00:29:10.180 --> 00:29:14.674
who were making money out of that temple. So many Hindus believe that;

00:29:18.695 --> 00:29:22.550
that to punish these horrible Brahmins who were making money

00:29:23.234 --> 00:29:27.086
He had to come as Mohammed Kuzni to break that idol

00:29:27.565 --> 00:29:30.302
which was giving them so much money and they were making

00:29:30.516 --> 00:29:32.728
all kinds of,

00:29:35.749 --> 00:29:37.751
you can say extractions,

00:29:38.433 --> 00:29:41.746
from the poor devotees who were devoted to that temple.

00:29:43.170 --> 00:29:45.610
It was only He could do it.

00:29:48.732 --> 00:29:55.732
So we have to understand that when we are not integrated

00:29:56.986 --> 00:30:00.605
we cannot feel the integration of our being.

00:30:01.629 --> 00:30:04.243
We are not integrated, that we have to realize.

00:30:05.539 --> 00:30:07.857
Our mind works in one way,

00:30:09.145 --> 00:30:13.512
our heart works in another way, our liver works in another way.

00:30:14.998 --> 00:30:16.911
As I told you I am quite surprised

00:30:17.023 --> 00:30:19.341
that when they have told that: 'don't drink',

00:30:20.017 --> 00:30:22.696
those people who follow these religions still go on drinking.

00:30:23.561 --> 00:30:25.854
But apart from that religion forget it.

00:30:25.893 --> 00:30:27.893
They see a man going into a pub

00:30:27.984 --> 00:30:31.223
and falling and faltering coming out,

00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:34.393
still they enter into the same to get to the same situation. Why?

00:30:35.369 --> 00:30:37.223
Because the mind tells them not to do it.

00:30:37.744 --> 00:30:40.201
Mind says: 'don't go.' The brain says: 'don't go.'

00:30:41.579 --> 00:30:45.717
But their heart is weak. They cannot. The habits.

00:30:46.681 --> 00:30:49.605
All the habits come through this kind of disintegration.

00:30:50.517 --> 00:30:52.949
We are so disintegrated within ourselves,

00:30:53.296 --> 00:30:57.331
that if a person wants to do something

00:30:57.784 --> 00:30:59.438
he just does the opposite of it

00:31:00.368 --> 00:31:01.683
and that is the reason

00:31:02.019 --> 00:31:05.492
why we accept these kind of juxtapositions in life,

00:31:05.826 --> 00:31:08.892
what was told by Him about music and about everything.

00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:17.112
Music has come out of God's love to us.

00:31:18.046 --> 00:31:21.597
Anything that is not for God's love is not music.

00:31:22.456 --> 00:31:24.454
I will give you an example. There was a lady

00:31:24.936 --> 00:31:27.952
who used to do some sort of a kawali

00:31:29.224 --> 00:31:31.661
and I was on the censor board. I censored her

00:31:33.043 --> 00:31:36.525
kawalis and I said: 'this is not a kawali.'

00:31:37.166 --> 00:31:39.768
She said: 'why?' I said: 'this is called as mujarat.

00:31:40.594 --> 00:31:43.533
This is horribly sensuous and horrible thing.

00:31:43.666 --> 00:31:45.745
It's an insult of God. You can't sing like that.'

00:31:46.563 --> 00:31:49.492
So she said: 'no, this is kawali.' I said:

00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:52.154
'do you know kawali was never sung by women

00:31:53.064 --> 00:31:55.928
and was never done in this dirty fashion the way

00:31:56.064 --> 00:31:58.501
like a prostitute you are singing this kawali?'

00:31:59.379 --> 00:32:02.873
It's always all the music was in the praise of God.

00:32:02.932 --> 00:32:04.472
And that's why Mohammed Sahib said

00:32:04.684 --> 00:32:07.836
that all the music should be in the praise of God

00:32:08.055 --> 00:32:11.282
and should not be. So we had other things like nath and all that.

00:32:12.012 --> 00:32:16.500
But you find even at the time of Shri Krishna all the music

00:32:16.753 --> 00:32:20.423
was to be just done for ras.

00:32:20.605 --> 00:32:23.007
Ra. Ra is 'energy'. Sa means 'same'.

00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:25.919
With Radha they were playing together,

00:32:26.202 --> 00:32:28.975
playing Rasa and that's how they were doing

00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:34.592
the circulation of the energy to integrate themselves

00:32:34.817 --> 00:32:40.640
and singing the music. It is for that. But you find that

00:32:41.378 --> 00:32:43.730
people don't understand.

00:32:43.855 --> 00:32:45.855
They use music for sensuousness.

00:32:46.136 --> 00:32:48.518
Is anti-God. This music force

00:32:48.663 --> 00:32:51.616
has come to us to praise God that's all. For nothing else.

00:32:52.294 --> 00:32:54.259
For doing all kinds of dirty things and

00:32:54.565 --> 00:32:56.825
singing all kinds of funny things. Imagine.

00:32:56.856 --> 00:32:58.646
And the reaction is built in so much.

00:32:58.905 --> 00:33:00.737
When He said that all the music

00:33:01.544 --> 00:33:03.647
should be in the name of God, we have a person like

00:33:03.704 --> 00:33:05.598
Horam Zebu who would not take to any music.

00:33:06.256 --> 00:33:10.160
He was such a staunchy fellow and the other Muslims who came in

00:33:10.426 --> 00:33:13.152
would not sing anything that is kawali or anything,

00:33:13.396 --> 00:33:15.118
would sing horrible gazals

00:33:17.465 --> 00:33:19.895
which are just describing the separation

00:33:20.448 --> 00:33:23.255
of a woman and a man and all kinds of dirty things.

00:33:26.112 --> 00:33:31.475
With this disintegrated temperaments people took to anything

00:33:31.970 --> 00:33:36.167
that came to them just to please themselves. When the advent

00:33:36.302 --> 00:33:37.913
of this thing like Omarkhyam.

00:33:38.043 --> 00:33:40.465
Who is he? He's anti-God absolutely anti-God man.

00:33:40.984 --> 00:33:41.679
Horrible.

00:33:41.703 --> 00:33:44.859
But people appreciate him very much, Omarkhyam what a poetry it is.

00:33:47.268 --> 00:33:51.399
They appreciate - why? Because the disintegrated part of their heart

00:33:51.511 --> 00:33:53.342
likes Omarkhyam when he sings:

00:33:53.503 --> 00:33:55.236
'Oh we should drink here.

00:33:55.322 --> 00:33:58.091
What is there in this life? We don't know what is going to be there.'

00:33:58.251 --> 00:34:00.782
Because Mohammed Sahib has said not to drink,

00:34:00.838 --> 00:34:04.362
he must sing such a song. This is the poetry of Mr. Omarkhyam,

00:34:04.574 --> 00:34:06.574
who is being very much respected everywhere.

00:34:10.749 --> 00:34:14.266
And he's very much regarded as a great poet

00:34:15.176 --> 00:34:23.079
in Iraq where today Khomeini is one great horrible man is born

00:34:23.372 --> 00:34:27.927
and he still respects this Omarkhyam; I don't know how can he respect him.

00:34:28.099 --> 00:34:32.330
What a contrast it is, just see, what a contrast this Omarkhyam

00:34:32.547 --> 00:34:33.496
singing dirty songs.

00:34:36.163 --> 00:34:37.670
They are not in praise of God.

00:34:38.217 --> 00:34:41.959
Music which is not in the praise of God is not music. Is ashleed.

00:34:42.984 --> 00:34:49.798
Is filth. Is dirt. Our classical music in India

00:34:50.206 --> 00:34:52.749
was based on AUM.

00:34:55.371 --> 00:34:57.685
Even at Kundalini when it reaches here

00:34:58.081 --> 00:35:00.291
at the vishuddhi chakra it makes all the sounds:

00:35:00.385 --> 00:35:03.679
AM, AAM, EM, EEM, UM, OOM, RIM, REEM, LRIM, LREEM,

00:35:04.071 --> 00:35:08.074
AYE, AYEE, AO, AOU, ANG, AH

00:35:08.326 --> 00:35:12.810
All these sixteen vowels are coming from the sixteen chakras

00:35:14.761 --> 00:35:18.689
or the sub-chakras or the petals of this vishuddhi chakra.

00:35:19.443 --> 00:35:23.212
These are Bija mantras of the vishuddhi chakra.

00:35:23.278 --> 00:35:25.278
All the vowels come from here

00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:33.847
and when we sing dirty songs we spoil this chakra vishuddhi.

00:35:34.278 --> 00:35:36.306
That's why all the people

00:35:36.459 --> 00:35:39.925
who sing these dirty songs have to take to drinking,

00:35:40.073 --> 00:35:42.146
because I think they can't bear,

00:35:43.427 --> 00:35:45.427
or they can't do it,

00:35:46.445 --> 00:35:48.445
they can't sing these bad songs

00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:53.305
unless and until they take to some sort of an escape from God.

00:35:54.471 --> 00:35:57.931
So music and drinking started going hand in hand.

00:36:00.336 --> 00:36:03.485
In the West the music broke all its traditions

00:36:04.742 --> 00:36:10.727
because they had no sense left in them

00:36:11.346 --> 00:36:14.088
to recognize that music is meant only for God.

00:36:14.431 --> 00:36:18.904
Only for hymns to be sung in the praise of God. All music

00:36:18.995 --> 00:36:20.244
should be in the praise of God.

00:36:20.377 --> 00:36:23.588
All ragas should be in the praise of God.

00:36:24.504 --> 00:36:27.099
We had no Namas system of different times,

00:36:27.242 --> 00:36:29.874
but we have a system of music in different times.

00:36:30.665 --> 00:36:33.252
At different time a certain music should be played

00:36:33.563 --> 00:36:35.191
where you describe a mood.

00:36:35.433 --> 00:36:37.433
And all the moods that are described

00:36:37.689 --> 00:36:39.689
have to relate themselves to God.

00:36:42.235 --> 00:36:46.325
There is no other mood that is enjoyable to the spirit

00:36:47.611 --> 00:36:53.721
that does not relate to God. There's no mood

00:36:54.713 --> 00:36:59.815
which one can enjoy. Even Bhivatsa the mood of Bhivatsa is grotesque.

00:37:00.621 --> 00:37:02.448
Even that mood one enjoyed,

00:37:02.728 --> 00:37:09.125
one can listen to when they see the filth and dirt. The left side.

00:37:10.788 --> 00:37:14.486
Is so scientific. Our music system is extremely scientific,

00:37:14.609 --> 00:37:21.331
because it was taken in the form of this music

00:37:21.586 --> 00:37:25.489
with actually the Kundalini moving into different these Sapta Swaras.

00:37:25.736 --> 00:37:30.735
These seven Swaras are built in our seven chakras:

00:37:32.772 --> 00:37:34.772
It start with Sa,

00:37:36.107 --> 00:37:41.848
then, Re, Ga, Ma - Mother, Pa,

00:37:42.566 --> 00:37:44.566
Dha, Ni.

00:37:44.913 --> 00:37:46.575
My name also starts with Ni.

00:37:49.075 --> 00:37:51.075
These seven Swaras

00:37:52.938 --> 00:37:57.171
are built in with seven notes and there are vrikrutis.

00:37:57.723 --> 00:38:00.761
Vrikrut Swaras which are the side other

00:38:01.411 --> 00:38:06.357
what-you-call chakras that we have

00:38:07.371 --> 00:38:11.392
to make about twelve Swaras.

00:38:12.883 --> 00:38:15.550
But nobody understood the real meaning of music.

00:38:17.125 --> 00:38:21.866
Sharada the Goddess of Saraswati is the one

00:38:22.070 --> 00:38:25.209
who carries the message of Virata within

00:38:26.403 --> 00:38:28.911
and tells us how to sing.

00:38:31.059 --> 00:38:33.533
She tells us what is appealing to God.

00:38:33.817 --> 00:38:36.670
How these ragas were made also just think of it.

00:38:37.684 --> 00:38:40.263
Because first they chose the notes

00:38:41.121 --> 00:38:43.605
the arroha of rohas the going up and down,

00:38:43.999 --> 00:38:45.580
which was appealing to God.

00:38:47.233 --> 00:38:48.716
So the melodies were created.

00:38:48.913 --> 00:38:50.098
Melodies are fixed.

00:38:50.681 --> 00:38:54.032
You cannot change the melodies the notes, because

00:38:54.195 --> 00:38:57.819
they found out that at this point the spirit awakened.

00:38:59.356 --> 00:39:01.102
On the vibrations they found out.

00:39:01.185 --> 00:39:05.760
They found out that when they sang this way it did - worked out.

00:39:06.656 --> 00:39:10.426
The Veena they played and they found out the exact Swaras.

00:39:12.901 --> 00:39:18.225
Exact Swaras which would really make you feel nice.

00:39:18.636 --> 00:39:21.155
Now you know that those people who are from -

00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:22.303
have come from the West

00:39:22.757 --> 00:39:26.555
don't understand any Indian music on the mental level.

00:39:27.725 --> 00:39:29.721
But they understand at the spiritual level

00:39:30.131 --> 00:39:34.171
because their spirits get filled with joy

00:39:34.349 --> 00:39:35.930
and the vibration starts flowing.

00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:41.999
The sense of music - this depiction of music was done by Shri Krishna.

00:39:43.222 --> 00:39:45.946
It is He the One who taught Tala.

00:39:47.177 --> 00:39:53.889
Of course we can say that Shiva is the One who dances the Tala,

00:39:54.672 --> 00:39:57.177
but the One who depicted it for human beings

00:39:57.745 --> 00:39:59.736
who gave the message to the world

00:40:00.635 --> 00:40:02.635
how the Tala should be, is

00:40:03.034 --> 00:40:06.231
Shri Krishna through His dancing movements.

00:40:08.616 --> 00:40:10.412
He kept the Tala all the time,

00:40:12.158 --> 00:40:15.638
like the way He stands itself suggests how He kept the Tala.

00:40:17.821 --> 00:40:19.463
And He played the mudlhi also

00:40:20.039 --> 00:40:24.737
to suggest that music is what God's love is.

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.799
His music is suggesting of God's love.

00:40:28.902 --> 00:40:34.343
That soothes you. That clears you. That makes you happy.

00:40:34.785 --> 00:40:36.627
That gives you joy.

00:40:37.487 --> 00:40:43.082
And that's why He suggested through His singing, through His music.

00:40:45.039 --> 00:40:46.918
He never wrote any poetry did He?

00:40:47.517 --> 00:40:51.951
He never wrote any poetry as such, but when He spoke,

00:40:53.058 --> 00:40:57.874
when He spoke in gudria in the prose it became Gita.

00:40:59.797 --> 00:41:02.093
Just when He spoke it became Gita.

00:41:03.049 --> 00:41:05.620
Of course people have tried to spoil

00:41:05.843 --> 00:41:09.594
quite a lot of it - the rhythm, which I feel sometimes when

00:41:09.846 --> 00:41:13.140
people recite it, but still

00:41:13.676 --> 00:41:16.136
we must say when He really created it, it was

00:41:16.492 --> 00:41:23.529
for human beings to create poetry out of prose.

00:41:24.156 --> 00:41:25.262
Out of prose.

00:41:27.965 --> 00:41:30.188
He made it communicable.

00:41:30.750 --> 00:41:34.175
Because people could first only understand the music,

00:41:34.259 --> 00:41:37.019
the rhythm of the music. They didn't understand

00:41:37.162 --> 00:41:40.457
much words and things but He made it possible.

00:41:42.020 --> 00:41:43.584
Even in Koran, if you read,

00:41:43.962 --> 00:41:48.367
the few words before starting every chapter nobody understands.

00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:50.548
They are all nothing but mantra bijas;

00:41:53.603 --> 00:41:54.620
but they put it there.

00:41:54.689 --> 00:41:56.038
They knew people won't understand,

00:41:56.052 --> 00:41:58.061
but He put it there because people would understand.

00:42:00.894 --> 00:42:03.147
All these things you may not understand.

00:42:03.801 --> 00:42:05.801
You may not understand Me either,

00:42:06.558 --> 00:42:11.095
possibly, but whatever they did was for your heetha.

00:42:12.253 --> 00:42:14.804
This is what happened, at the time of Shri Krishna

00:42:15.013 --> 00:42:18.323
that He established the concept of heeth,

00:42:19.950 --> 00:42:24.295
because it was said that you must speak the truth

00:42:24.701 --> 00:42:28.118
and you must speak the thing that is sweet, Pria.

00:42:31.205 --> 00:42:35.652
It was the message of Shri Krishna that you must speak sweetly.

00:42:36.031 --> 00:42:38.532
Those people who have

00:42:40.501 --> 00:42:43.777
got a proper vishuddhi chakra speak very sweetly.

00:42:44.031 --> 00:42:47.053
Their voice has that enchanting method

00:42:47.268 --> 00:42:49.543
of capturing the hearts of people

00:42:49.832 --> 00:42:52.892
and not debasing them, but elevating them.

00:42:55.022 --> 00:42:57.297
So He said you must do it sweetly.

00:42:57.404 --> 00:42:59.404
That was His main theme.

00:42:59.425 --> 00:43:03.053
Everything He did so sweetly that He created a leela

00:43:03.081 --> 00:43:06.145
out of His doings. It was a leela that he made.

00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:10.221
He said this world is not a place where you should be serious,

00:43:10.813 --> 00:43:12.286
you should be sharp,

00:43:12.858 --> 00:43:16.728
you should be tense, but it's a leela. Just see the leela, the drama.

00:43:17.206 --> 00:43:20.206
The whole is a drama. So the whole thing is very sweet.

00:43:20.329 --> 00:43:24.910
If you see the whole world as a drama it becomes a sweet thing.

00:43:25.784 --> 00:43:29.840
The sweetness of it, even if you see a person

00:43:30.030 --> 00:43:33.426
trying to be funny, you get a joy out of it.

00:43:35.295 --> 00:43:36.667
If you know it's a drama

00:43:36.790 --> 00:43:39.708
you don't get worried if somebody comes and murders somebody

00:43:39.739 --> 00:43:41.739
and you know it's all fake, it's a drama.

00:43:42.404 --> 00:43:46.419
It's a drama going on and that's what He told people

00:43:46.516 --> 00:43:48.304
that the whole thing is a leela

00:43:48.459 --> 00:43:51.348
so that people should not get into serious moods and

00:43:51.422 --> 00:43:54.358
actually start acting in the drama in the real way.

00:43:54.724 --> 00:43:57.757
Like, you see, you appoint somebody as,

00:43:59.483 --> 00:44:02.743
say, Shivaji Maharaj

00:44:03.542 --> 00:44:07.670
and there is somebody coming from the other side and he takes

00:44:07.946 --> 00:44:10.252
a sword and he really hits

00:44:11.046 --> 00:44:15.054
the fellow there and you say this Shivaji Maharaj actor is no good;

00:44:15.087 --> 00:44:18.861
he gets absolutely involved into the thing and hits the other person.

00:44:21.147 --> 00:44:24.841
So it's a drama and He made it into a leela.

00:44:25.631 --> 00:44:29.148
Leela because it's a drama no doubt. But when,

00:44:29.442 --> 00:44:32.643
when you get realized you start seeing the drama and the play

00:44:32.889 --> 00:44:34.116
and the whole thing is,

00:44:34.555 --> 00:44:37.716
you must have seen that most of the Sahaja Yogis are always laughing,

00:44:38.295 --> 00:44:40.536
because they see the way things are happening.

00:44:40.893 --> 00:44:44.797
Even when they see a guru misbehaving or something

00:44:44.937 --> 00:44:47.102
they just feel like laughing how absurd it is.

00:44:48.051 --> 00:44:50.966
Like somebody came today to talk to Me

00:44:51.843 --> 00:44:55.247
and he told Me: 'Mother, I have been to all kinds of nonsensical things.'

00:44:55.265 --> 00:44:58.125
And he was just laughing. He said: 'I laugh at them now what I did.'

00:44:58.407 --> 00:45:01.808
He said: 'I went to one guru who is going to - who used

00:45:01.883 --> 00:45:03.456
to give name to people;

00:45:03.624 --> 00:45:05.080
say this Nama that Nam.

00:45:05.419 --> 00:45:08.625
I made such efforts, I went to people,

00:45:08.679 --> 00:45:11.662
recommended my case.' Because he was not so rich,

00:45:11.740 --> 00:45:13.844
you see, so he was never bought the name

00:45:14.065 --> 00:45:15.917
and he was saying: 'give me the name.

00:45:15.962 --> 00:45:17.594
I must have the name.' And the guru was

00:45:17.612 --> 00:45:19.612
saying; 'No, no, no, no. You have to wait three...'

00:45:19.791 --> 00:45:22.676
He said: 'I poured so much money in his savapati

00:45:22.914 --> 00:45:26.217
and which were large savapatis were put. I did everything,

00:45:26.672 --> 00:45:28.406
but he would not give me a name

00:45:28.815 --> 00:45:31.127
and ultimately when it

00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:33.606
came to that he said: 'all right I'll give you a name',

00:45:34.232 --> 00:45:35.741
and he gave me a name

00:45:36.033 --> 00:45:38.974
which I started taking. I really became mad after that.

00:45:38.993 --> 00:45:41.293
I started getting headaches, this that.

00:45:41.745 --> 00:45:43.745
Then he said; 'all right you have to suffer.

00:45:44.099 --> 00:45:46.349
If you don't suffer you must go through it.

00:45:46.536 --> 00:45:48.668
Yes you must. You asked for the name so you have it.'

00:45:49.130 --> 00:45:50.517
And when he came to Me,

00:45:50.809 --> 00:45:54.119
he was looking like nothing on earth, I tell you.

00:45:54.286 --> 00:45:56.213
In a very funny shape he came to Me,

00:45:56.793 --> 00:45:58.672
but now he's completely cured.

00:45:58.693 --> 00:46:01.312
I could not even recognize him the other day I just saw him.

00:46:01.759 --> 00:46:03.771
I said: 'Oh God are you the same person?'

00:46:04.161 --> 00:46:06.333
So he said: 'Mother now I laugh at all these things

00:46:06.603 --> 00:46:10.269
and I just see that how people are stupid

00:46:11.313 --> 00:46:14.830
to go to these false people, follow false ideas and

00:46:15.151 --> 00:46:18.478
false conceptions and how they are missing the point.'

00:46:21.294 --> 00:46:22.662
And he asked Me a question:

00:46:22.815 --> 00:46:26.417
'have they to go to that limit of destruction to come to You?'

00:46:26.949 --> 00:46:29.676
I said: 'I don't know about them what they have decided.'

00:46:30.292 --> 00:46:33.925
But it is true that people are so stupid

00:46:34.572 --> 00:46:39.235
that they take to all these ideas and all these negative things

00:46:39.604 --> 00:46:42.385
much more easily than to the positive things,

00:46:43.066 --> 00:46:46.192
because of the vishuddhi chakra being spoilt.

00:46:47.482 --> 00:46:51.612
If your vishuddhi chakra is not spoilt, your hands are working better.

00:46:52.617 --> 00:46:54.303
Many people who get realization

00:46:55.174 --> 00:46:57.095
do not feel vibrations in the hands,

00:46:57.398 --> 00:47:00.738
because their vishuddhi chakras are not all right.

00:47:01.197 --> 00:47:04.710
Now what does that mean that your vishuddhi chakra is not all right?

00:47:04.943 --> 00:47:08.788
First of all by temperament you are not a collective person -

00:47:09.447 --> 00:47:15.761
by temperament. You are not a person who enjoys collectivity much.

00:47:15.948 --> 00:47:17.611
Like people who are fussy.

00:47:18.341 --> 00:47:20.558
'I want this. I want that.

00:47:20.890 --> 00:47:24.697
I want to sleep on a proper bed.

00:47:24.773 --> 00:47:28.276
I must have this. I must do that.' This kind of an 'I'.

00:47:28.543 --> 00:47:30.880
Those who have too much 'I' in them

00:47:31.286 --> 00:47:35.226
because both the ego and super-ego start from this vishuddhi chakra.

00:47:36.175 --> 00:47:40.810
You see a man who is an egoistical person is

00:47:41.308 --> 00:47:44.580
not able to see the collectivity at all because

00:47:44.776 --> 00:47:46.425
he is separated with the rest of them.

00:47:46.953 --> 00:47:51.915
His Omkara covers his being so much that he cannot enjoy the collectivity.

00:47:53.418 --> 00:47:59.281
Now you see Shri Krishna live with whom? With gopis who little, little boys.

00:47:59.402 --> 00:48:05.769
He went and used to look after His cows. Just looking after the cows.

00:48:07.523 --> 00:48:09.859
None of these incarnations you'll find

00:48:10.298 --> 00:48:12.556
were interested in rich people or anything.

00:48:15.161 --> 00:48:17.283
He went and stayed

00:48:17.844 --> 00:48:22.974
with people who were very ordinary from the worldly point of view

00:48:24.367 --> 00:48:28.804
and there He played and there He did all these tricks of sweetness.

00:48:29.749 --> 00:48:36.429
He used to steal the butter. He used to steal the butter,

00:48:37.582 --> 00:48:41.324
and many people who are criticizing Him

00:48:41.544 --> 00:48:43.807
always say: 'Oh He was a thief.

00:48:44.028 --> 00:48:47.763
Yes He was a thief. He was the thief of the thieves.' And so on.

00:48:48.678 --> 00:48:50.291
He used to steal the butter,

00:48:50.582 --> 00:48:54.214
because this butter was taken to Mathura

00:48:54.579 --> 00:49:01.281
by these ladies to get some money. And that was giving more help

00:49:02.176 --> 00:49:08.558
to all these horrible rakshasas who were in Mathura.

00:49:09.540 --> 00:49:15.135
So He didn't want this to go there and give them this good health.

00:49:16.100 --> 00:49:19.928
The best thing was to steal the butter so they don't get it

00:49:20.327 --> 00:49:22.156
and they starve on their,

00:49:22.322 --> 00:49:26.167
they have their deficiencies of the vitamin A and D you can call it

00:49:26.344 --> 00:49:28.887
and that they suffer from bad throat

00:49:29.127 --> 00:49:31.127
and they have no strength in their hands

00:49:31.207 --> 00:49:33.207
when they pick up their swords.

00:49:34.523 --> 00:49:36.158
So this was the way to hit them

00:49:36.475 --> 00:49:40.607
so that they could not fight the forces of good.

00:49:41.860 --> 00:49:46.731
So in that He proved that a higher goal is to be achieved by giving up

00:49:46.991 --> 00:49:53.428
smaller, silly, stupid goals. The heetha. heetha is the main thing,

00:49:53.887 --> 00:50:00.049
because when He said that: 'You don't speak the truth,

00:50:02.165 --> 00:50:07.083
otherwise people will be hurt.'

00:50:08.693 --> 00:50:09.919
All right, so what should you do?

00:50:10.490 --> 00:50:13.824
You hurt the people so you don't speak the truth,

00:50:14.282 --> 00:50:17.900
or you speak the truth you hurt the people. So both cannot go together.

00:50:18.272 --> 00:50:23.743
Like if I tell somebody: 'Oh you are so bad.' That person gets hurt.

00:50:24.256 --> 00:50:27.985
Now if I don't tell that person, that person is lost. So what to do?

00:50:29.483 --> 00:50:34.719
He found out the solution so He said: ....

00:50:37.692 --> 00:50:46.362
He put the word in between as heetha.

00:50:48.272 --> 00:50:55.750
The word heetha means 'good to your spirit;

00:50:56.523 --> 00:51:05.345
whatever is good for your spirit.' Heetha word means 'good for your spirit'.

00:51:05.796 --> 00:51:10.209
It has nothing to do with material things. It means for your spirit.

00:51:11.049 --> 00:51:12.270
For example,

00:51:12.828 --> 00:51:17.267
if I tell somebody that: 'you should not do that', he may feel bad today,

00:51:18.552 --> 00:51:22.657
but if he recognizes that: 'Mother is telling me for my good',

00:51:23.064 --> 00:51:26.918
he will do it  and he will gain by that in his heetha.

00:51:27.377 --> 00:51:29.743
Or else if he does not do it, later on -

00:51:30.770 --> 00:51:32.983
supposing I don't tell him and if he

00:51:33.197 --> 00:51:35.910
doesn't know about it, or even if I tell him he does not do it -

00:51:36.081 --> 00:51:40.153
he is going to feel bad. So it is not priya to his spirit.

00:51:40.260 --> 00:51:41.517
It is not priya to him.

00:51:42.147 --> 00:51:46.685
So if you do something that is the heetha of a person,

00:51:46.967 --> 00:51:49.086
sometimes you have to tell a person,

00:51:51.160 --> 00:51:55.277
sometimes it may look very, very painful.

00:51:55.306 --> 00:51:56.737
The other day I told somebody that:

00:51:56.787 --> 00:52:00.793
'you don't cure anybody because you're not strong enough to cure.'

00:52:01.198 --> 00:52:02.480
He felt very hurt.

00:52:05.749 --> 00:52:08.589
So then I'll say: 'all right go ahead. You better cure others,

00:52:08.775 --> 00:52:09.911
but don't come back to Me.'

00:52:11.615 --> 00:52:13.625
Then he'll land up in a lunatic asylum.

00:52:16.041 --> 00:52:18.324
But when he'll land up in the lunatic asylum

00:52:20.229 --> 00:52:24.062
then what will he say? Was that for his heetha that I said?

00:52:24.845 --> 00:52:28.842
Will he be then angry? So ultimately if you say the heetha.

00:52:29.511 --> 00:52:33.473
Say. Saying is the point. Not doing. Saying.

00:52:34.024 --> 00:52:37.450
You say the heetha with your vishuddhi chakra,

00:52:37.625 --> 00:52:41.948
then ultimately it becomes priya. Means it is light.

00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:47.779
So you say a thing which is good for the spirit.

00:52:48.170 --> 00:52:49.715
Otherwise you just don't say.

00:52:51.145 --> 00:52:54.399
But people just say to others to correct them,

00:52:54.872 --> 00:52:58.693
because they are aggressive. It should be done in love.

00:52:59.662 --> 00:53:02.525
Heetha means "done something in love".

00:53:03.038 --> 00:53:05.827
If you want to say something to someone in love

00:53:05.933 --> 00:53:07.625
and you feel it is necessary

00:53:07.870 --> 00:53:10.627
and the third condition you must have adikar.

00:53:11.082 --> 00:53:13.423
You must have the right to say it to the person.

00:53:13.856 --> 00:53:16.016
If you don't have the right you just keep quiet.

00:53:16.200 --> 00:53:18.742
Let God look after. You are not in charge of anyone.

00:53:20.361 --> 00:53:22.653
But if you have to say to someone in love

00:53:22.840 --> 00:53:25.459
and if you have an adikara then you have to say it.

00:53:25.903 --> 00:53:29.406
If you don't have the adikar you should not say anything to anyone

00:53:29.775 --> 00:53:33.476
unless and until it is absolutely priya to that person

00:53:34.641 --> 00:53:36.091
involving his heetha.

00:53:38.769 --> 00:53:39.925
This is what He put,

00:53:40.126 --> 00:53:43.629
that you should not do any anadikar chestha. Means you should not do

00:53:43.664 --> 00:53:44.793
something unauthorized.

00:53:46.104 --> 00:53:49.158
Like I would say somebody comes to Me and says that:

00:53:49.247 --> 00:53:51.247
'where is that person whom I want to murder?'

00:53:53.539 --> 00:53:55.493
Then what is the truth? Should I tell him: 'all right

00:53:55.512 --> 00:53:57.918
this is the truth. You go and kill that person.' According

00:53:57.938 --> 00:54:01.111
to the strict government law it may be.

00:54:01.848 --> 00:54:05.303
I don't know if it is. I don't understand the government laws at all

00:54:05.870 --> 00:54:08.677
or the human laws. But it is not.

00:54:09.590 --> 00:54:10.945
Then what do you have to tell him?

00:54:11.668 --> 00:54:15.608
You just keep quiet. He has no Adikar. He has no right to ask you

00:54:15.728 --> 00:54:19.500
or to get this information from you. You just keep quiet. I do.

00:54:20.485 --> 00:54:23.025
Then he may beat you - do anything. You just say: 'I don't know.'

00:54:26.010 --> 00:54:27.478
It is andikar cheestha.

00:54:35.573 --> 00:54:39.571
It is done many a times. People who are, say,

00:54:42.025 --> 00:54:48.001
great nationalists who fight for their country and

00:54:48.447 --> 00:54:50.847
people want to extract information from them.

00:54:51.526 --> 00:54:54.603
They suffer. Suffer. But they will not give the information.

00:54:55.476 --> 00:54:58.178
Not out of fear, but out of love

00:54:58.636 --> 00:55:02.540
of their fellow men who are fighting for the freedom of their country.

00:55:02.612 --> 00:55:04.792
This has been done in our country many a times.

00:55:06.429 --> 00:55:08.227
So you don't speak something

00:55:08.506 --> 00:55:11.354
which is not the adikara of another. He has no right

00:55:11.448 --> 00:55:12.366
to ask this question.

00:55:15.676 --> 00:55:18.181
Like that one has to be very discreet

00:55:18.430 --> 00:55:21.807
and that is what Shri Krishna has given us - His discretion.

00:55:23.964 --> 00:55:26.216
 Many people ask Me: 'Mother then in this situation

00:55:26.272 --> 00:55:27.163
what should I do?

00:55:27.278 --> 00:55:29.122
In that situation what should I do?'

00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:31.843
That means the person has not developed a vishuddhi chakra

00:55:31.936 --> 00:55:32.755
to be discreet.

00:55:33.324 --> 00:55:35.015
He has not evolved. He is not mature enough.

00:55:35.034 --> 00:55:36.427
He is still asking Me questions.

00:55:37.597 --> 00:55:38.782
In the nirvikalpa state

00:55:38.803 --> 00:55:41.395
you don't ask Me any questions. You know exactly what is to be done.

00:55:41.804 --> 00:55:44.622
When to shout at somebody. When to be quiet.

00:55:44.846 --> 00:55:48.966
When to be silent. When to say something and how far to go.

00:55:51.144 --> 00:55:54.381
All these qualities develop through proper vishuddhi chakra,

00:55:55.142 --> 00:55:57.742
because you are doing it for the heetha of another person.

00:55:58.027 --> 00:56:00.166
Sometimes it pays much more to keep quiet.

00:56:03.081 --> 00:56:04.854
This is what He has taught us.

00:56:05.094 --> 00:56:06.153
Not only taught us

00:56:06.300 --> 00:56:11.180
but He has put it within us the discretion part in our vishuddhi chakra.

00:56:13.350 --> 00:56:18.716
He has put within us the power to witness the drama. To be detached.

00:56:19.407 --> 00:56:22.327
He was Yogeshwara. He was Yogeshwara.

00:56:22.445 --> 00:56:24.117
He was the Ishwara of yoga.

00:56:24.750 --> 00:56:26.935
He was the One who was the giver of yoga.

00:56:27.198 --> 00:56:30.148
Naturally, because Shiva is the One to be achieved.

00:56:30.510 --> 00:56:34.217
But the One who helps us is Him. Is Akbar.

00:56:37.177 --> 00:56:43.569
Is the Mahalakshmi tattwa, is the central path which takes you to Shiva.

00:56:43.926 --> 00:56:45.926
So He is the One who takes us there.

00:56:47.135 --> 00:56:49.421
It is He who is supported by all the prophets.

00:56:51.444 --> 00:56:55.540
He works out this for you. This great work of evolution.

00:56:57.172 --> 00:56:59.255
So one can understand very clearly

00:56:59.954 --> 00:57:04.543
that if our vishuddhi chakra is put right, we develop exactly

00:57:04.962 --> 00:57:07.039
how to be discreet in Sahaja Yoga.

00:57:09.116 --> 00:57:11.917
We devise a method by which we talk so much

00:57:13.047 --> 00:57:19.013
that makes people feel priya that they appreciate, they like it, priya.

00:57:19.180 --> 00:57:22.613
It's loving and also it does their heetha.

00:57:23.169 --> 00:57:26.155
Even sometimes you have to say something which is harsh

00:57:26.359 --> 00:57:29.953
or maybe your silence may make them feel a little harsh. Doesn't matter.

00:57:31.443 --> 00:57:33.837
It will give them ultimately their heetha.

00:57:33.975 --> 00:57:37.099
So the ultimate goal is heetha. That's what Krishna had

00:57:37.375 --> 00:57:39.332
in His mind to do the heetha.

00:57:41.341 --> 00:57:44.774
So His Samhara Shakti also which He had, the killing.

00:57:45.821 --> 00:57:48.921
Many people criticize Him for that.

00:57:49.046 --> 00:57:50.976
Like the Jains you see. At the time

00:57:51.166 --> 00:57:53.478
of Shri Krishna He had a cousin called Neminath

00:57:54.190 --> 00:57:56.717
and Neminath was not Shri Krishna.

00:57:57.007 --> 00:58:01.374
He was just an ordinary human being who had achieved certain

00:58:01.503 --> 00:58:02.830
heights in evolution.

00:58:03.288 --> 00:58:06.459
He just got filled up with a kind of a feeling

00:58:06.652 --> 00:58:10.519
of a repulsion about killing animals.

00:58:11.138 --> 00:58:13.388
Of course killing animals is not a very good thing,

00:58:13.775 --> 00:58:17.191
but he was not killing and it was to be done for his marriage.

00:58:18.187 --> 00:58:21.480
So he developed such a strong feeling about it that he started

00:58:21.788 --> 00:58:27.347
a different thing from real Jainism. Some sort of another path,

00:58:27.565 --> 00:58:32.040
in which he said that there should be no killing of animals.

00:58:32.276 --> 00:58:35.437
It so became so ridiculously funny, that

00:58:35.509 --> 00:58:39.619
it reached a stage where bugs became more important than human beings,

00:58:39.844 --> 00:58:42.352
even mosquitoes were more important.

00:58:42.705 --> 00:58:46.665
You see those people walking with this thing covered on their faces

00:58:46.748 --> 00:58:50.207
and on the street. Everything taken to the last nonsense.

00:58:53.929 --> 00:58:56.898
So Shri Krishna gives you discretion

00:58:57.167 --> 00:58:59.888
and this was very, very, very, very, very important

00:59:01.624 --> 00:59:03.278
because all our problems

00:59:03.499 --> 00:59:06.477
of disintegration disappears when we have discretion.

00:59:07.796 --> 00:59:10.798
But mostly people don't have their vishuddhi all right.

00:59:11.694 --> 00:59:15.813
On the one side there's a right vishuddhi which gives us aggressiveness.

00:59:15.921 --> 00:59:18.146
With our talk we aggress others.

00:59:19.652 --> 00:59:22.297
Most of the politicians have that kind of a capacity.

00:59:23.230 --> 00:59:26.594
But if they get mediums into them like supra-conscious,

00:59:27.026 --> 00:59:31.436
like Hitler had. He learnt it from some Tibetan lamas

00:59:31.470 --> 00:59:35.038
who taught them these all dirty tricks of overpowering people.

00:59:35.169 --> 00:59:37.580
He managed to put such spirits into them,

00:59:37.720 --> 00:59:39.476
that they killed thousands and

00:59:39.604 --> 00:59:42.503
thousands and thousands and thousands of human beings.

00:59:46.085 --> 00:59:48.045
The left vishuddhi is another problem.

00:59:48.530 --> 00:59:50.338
Such people also don't have

00:59:50.672 --> 00:59:53.125
a collectivity sense because they are frightened of others.

00:59:54.382 --> 00:59:57.558
They are so negative they always see the negative side of another person.

00:59:58.781 --> 01:00:00.642
I have seen people who come and tell Me

01:00:00.690 --> 01:00:02.312
about every Sahaja Yogi:

01:00:02.351 --> 01:00:05.480
'that's wrong with that Sahaja Yogi. This is wrong with that Sahaja Yogi.

01:00:05.533 --> 01:00:07.685
That's wrong with...' No positive points at all.

01:00:07.896 --> 01:00:09.218
They only see the negative point.

01:00:11.190 --> 01:00:13.850
So they have no collectivity. They are always have fear.

01:00:14.058 --> 01:00:15.627
All the time they are frightened

01:00:15.778 --> 01:00:18.337
of others because there's something in them that frightens them.

01:00:21.375 --> 01:00:23.066
So they have their left vishuddhi

01:00:23.257 --> 01:00:25.257
very badly caught up because they are guilty.

01:00:25.949 --> 01:00:27.562
Specially in the West, you will be surprised,

01:00:27.597 --> 01:00:29.680
who are supposed to be such aggressive people.

01:00:31.063 --> 01:00:35.041
They have terrible left vishuddhi, because they,

01:00:35.767 --> 01:00:39.457
by their doing, build up a very big guilt within themselves.

01:00:40.192 --> 01:00:42.769
They see how they have been behaving.

01:00:42.784 --> 01:00:44.978
Their community has been behaving.

01:00:44.998 --> 01:00:48.547
Their country has been behaving. They develop a big guilt in their mind.

01:00:48.690 --> 01:00:53.773
Moreover, as Brian has told you, that it is cut -

01:00:55.371 --> 01:01:01.399
the roots are cut and you start behaving in an anti-God manner

01:01:01.499 --> 01:01:03.997
even without realizing that it's absolutely wrong.

01:01:04.823 --> 01:01:09.872
It's true. The left vishuddhi comes up because they feel guilty,

01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:14.535
despite their doing wrong things

01:01:14.902 --> 01:01:17.477
with the knowledge that they are doing the right thing.

01:01:17.705 --> 01:01:20.011
They feel guilty because in the sub-conscious

01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:24.676
the conscience of a person works it out

01:01:24.725 --> 01:01:28.463
and that guilt is accumulating howsoever you may deny it,

01:01:28.877 --> 01:01:31.104
but the left side goes on catching

01:01:31.208 --> 01:01:33.686
and they have a left vishuddhi. So one has to say that:

01:01:33.723 --> 01:01:34.780
'Mother, I am not guilty.'

01:01:36.299 --> 01:01:37.774
Is another side of ego

01:01:37.947 --> 01:01:41.473
where the ego's reaction hides itself into left vishuddhi.

01:01:45.091 --> 01:01:46.732
And with that they start feeling guilty:

01:01:46.746 --> 01:01:49.268
'I should not have done that. I should not have done that.'

01:01:49.447 --> 01:01:51.014
Both attitudes are wrong.

01:01:51.984 --> 01:01:55.003
When you are on the left side you aggress yourself

01:01:55.284 --> 01:01:59.680
and torture yourself and when you are on the right side you torture others

01:02:00.123 --> 01:02:01.509
and aggress them.

01:02:01.602 --> 01:02:03.995
So to be in the center is only possible

01:02:04.144 --> 01:02:05.773
if your vishuddhi chakra is all right.

01:02:09.112 --> 01:02:10.809
Otherwise you cannot.

01:02:11.879 --> 01:02:13.327
You have seen many people

01:02:13.665 --> 01:02:15.000
when they get realization

01:02:15.001 --> 01:02:17.512
they don't feel vibrations on both the hands equally.

01:02:17.973 --> 01:02:19.973
The reason is they have no balance.

01:02:20.576 --> 01:02:23.023
It shows on the hands. They have no balance.

01:02:23.069 --> 01:02:26.229
Now hands are very important part of human beings after Sahaja Yoga.

01:02:27.108 --> 01:02:29.497
If your hands do not have equals,

01:02:29.732 --> 01:02:31.935
equal vibrations, then something wrong with you.

01:02:32.286 --> 01:02:34.021
Whatever side you do not have

01:02:35.250 --> 01:02:39.024
vibrations, say, if you don't have vibrations right side or

01:02:39.414 --> 01:02:43.371
you feel that right side is heavy, or

01:02:43.398 --> 01:02:47.613
is hot, then definitely you are right sided person.

01:02:48.274 --> 01:02:51.901
In such cases maybe left side is absolutely numb.

01:02:52.084 --> 01:02:55.461
Those people have numb left side means also they are right sided.

01:02:57.950 --> 01:03:02.811
But in the left hand if you have more vibrations and on the right hand

01:03:02.943 --> 01:03:03.953
you don't have any,

01:03:04.277 --> 01:03:07.447
then also it means that you are right sided,

01:03:10.621 --> 01:03:14.200
not that you are left sided. But on the other side

01:03:14.289 --> 01:03:17.444
if you have the other way round then you are a left sided person.

01:03:17.698 --> 01:03:19.902
That means the balance is not there. Your hand says

01:03:20.095 --> 01:03:21.318
that there should be balance.

01:03:23.319 --> 01:03:26.229
So you must know that only by thinking

01:03:26.539 --> 01:03:29.520
you are not going to get rid of your troubles in Sahaja Yoga you

01:03:29.546 --> 01:03:31.177
have to work with your hands. As I told you

01:03:31.304 --> 01:03:33.530
that just by thinking you can't drive your car,

01:03:33.562 --> 01:03:34.617
you have to use your hands.

01:03:34.661 --> 01:03:36.661
You have to use your hands with full knowledge

01:03:36.799 --> 01:03:38.046
as to where you are,

01:03:38.096 --> 01:03:40.341
what you are and what would these vibrations mean.

01:03:40.398 --> 01:03:43.730
You have to use your hands. Now when you start using your hands

01:03:43.887 --> 01:03:45.522
for all practical purposes

01:03:45.646 --> 01:03:48.210
other people might start thinking: 'these people have gone mad.

01:03:48.244 --> 01:03:49.333
They are using their hands.'

01:03:49.773 --> 01:03:51.738
But the same way they thought when Mohammed Sahib

01:03:51.786 --> 01:03:53.040
taught them to use their hands.

01:03:54.626 --> 01:03:56.791
They all laughed at Him but now

01:03:57.610 --> 01:04:00.048
nobody is ashamed of it, nobody laughs at it

01:04:00.270 --> 01:04:03.270
but they are doing all mechanically - not the way He has said.

01:04:08.929 --> 01:04:11.857
So first of all use these hands for your own purpose.

01:04:12.280 --> 01:04:14.274
For yourself. These same hands can help you.

01:04:14.790 --> 01:04:16.600
Now the Kundalini has awakened;

01:04:16.814 --> 01:04:21.014
so it is passing through all the centers in a very thin way maybe,

01:04:21.114 --> 01:04:21.912
but it is there.

01:04:22.102 --> 01:04:24.544
So first raise it more and more. You can do it with your hands.

01:04:26.259 --> 01:04:28.487
It's, it's a circle

01:04:28.839 --> 01:04:31.548
when your hands raise it it starts flowing more in your hands.

01:04:31.888 --> 01:04:34.694
Only your hands can raise it. It starts flowing in your hands.

01:04:35.165 --> 01:04:37.431
Giving yourself a Bandhan or raise yourself -

01:04:37.518 --> 01:04:40.848
raise your Kundalini. Learn all these methods carefully.

01:04:40.970 --> 01:04:42.600
Your hands are very important.

01:04:43.204 --> 01:04:45.964
If your hands are not working, you be careful on that.

01:04:50.553 --> 01:04:53.653
You have to get your vibrations in your hands to begin with.

01:04:54.227 --> 01:04:56.433
Some people who have had problems with their hands,

01:04:56.960 --> 01:04:59.545
because of previous life or some sort of a thing,

01:04:59.815 --> 01:05:04.366
they feel their chakras in the - their own places.

01:05:07.855 --> 01:05:10.835
Then after some times you'll start feeling your chakras in your brain.

01:05:16.059 --> 01:05:16.880
Doesn't matter.

01:05:17.068 --> 01:05:19.587
You will never feel anything uncomfortable with it.

01:05:19.612 --> 01:05:20.842
You will be able to manage.

01:05:21.462 --> 01:05:25.695
After that you need not feel the chakras at all. You don't feel anything.

01:05:25.764 --> 01:05:30.042
You just say; 'this is it.' Finished. They just know.

01:05:32.095 --> 01:05:33.622
That also 'knowing'

01:05:33.859 --> 01:05:37.394
comes through your vishuddhi and you just say it, again say it.

01:05:39.267 --> 01:05:43.052
The most important function of the vishuddhi chakra is

01:05:43.319 --> 01:05:46.151
that it should be pure and clean because

01:05:46.204 --> 01:05:49.180
if you have to say mantras your vishuddhi has to be clean.

01:05:51.016 --> 01:05:54.510
All the mantras have to have the help of vishuddhis.

01:05:54.773 --> 01:05:56.490
When a guru gives a mantra,

01:05:56.913 --> 01:06:00.715
first thing you'll find he will have a left vishuddhi catch

01:06:01.869 --> 01:06:05.459
and any other chakra whatever the chakra the guru has attacked.

01:06:05.831 --> 01:06:07.667
But first will be on the left vishuddhi

01:06:07.789 --> 01:06:11.003
so for that we use the mantra of mantrasiddhi

01:06:11.994 --> 01:06:15.490
The mantrasiddhi comes on a person when his left vishuddhi is all right

01:06:15.628 --> 01:06:17.294
otherwise he cannot be mantrasiddhi.

01:06:17.715 --> 01:06:20.274
Whatever mantras they say is all mechanical.

01:06:22.044 --> 01:06:25.885
Your left vishuddhi should be all right if you have to say the mantras

01:06:26.050 --> 01:06:29.611
in a proper way to be effective to have enlightened mantras.

01:06:29.653 --> 01:06:33.223
Even Allah ho Akbar has no meaning if your left vishuddhi is not all right.

01:06:36.146 --> 01:06:39.765
So you will see how in Sahaja Yoga left vishuddhi is important

01:06:39.906 --> 01:06:42.069
and right vishuddhi is important for vibrations.

01:06:43.071 --> 01:06:51.188
So vishuddhi chakra plays a tremendous part, role in, in Sahaja Yoga

01:06:52.878 --> 01:06:56.539
because it connects you to the Virat, to the whole.

01:06:56.809 --> 01:06:58.146
So you come to the point

01:06:58.277 --> 01:07:00.914
where you know that it is trough vishuddhi chakra.

01:07:01.022 --> 01:07:03.022
You know the whole Akbar.

01:07:04.340 --> 01:07:05.661
You get connected with Him.

01:07:06.110 --> 01:07:08.520
The rapport is established through vishuddhi chakra

01:07:09.278 --> 01:07:11.278
and you can feel it, is communicated.

01:07:12.061 --> 01:07:14.496
The rapport may be, supposing the hands are cut,

01:07:14.890 --> 01:07:17.504
still you might get your Realization. Many get it.

01:07:18.131 --> 01:07:20.780
But if you do not have your hands intact,

01:07:21.036 --> 01:07:22.672
then the communication is poor.

01:07:24.907 --> 01:07:26.907
Then maybe on your chakras you will start

01:07:27.075 --> 01:07:29.383
developing the communication later on.

01:07:29.822 --> 01:07:32.024
But this is the easiest way

01:07:32.153 --> 01:07:36.221
to feel the communication in your hands, if your hands are sensitive.

01:07:37.910 --> 01:07:40.928
So what should we do to keep the vishuddhi chakra is the problem.

01:07:41.266 --> 01:07:44.689
I have been told that I should finish My lecture soon and go away soon,

01:07:44.862 --> 01:07:48.435
but I think I should finish this today about vishuddhi chakra.

01:07:49.018 --> 01:07:52.299
What should we do to keep our vishuddhi chakra all right?

01:07:52.634 --> 01:07:56.970
Steal the butter and eat it.

01:08:00.332 --> 01:08:03.535
You must eat butter because it has vitamin A and D.

01:08:03.603 --> 01:08:06.275
Vitamin D especially. I am sorry. Vitamin D.

01:08:07.878 --> 01:08:11.604
So that calcium grows in your body. So you'll become a strong person.

01:08:12.439 --> 01:08:17.221
If you just take calcium without butter then there's a problem.

01:08:19.169 --> 01:08:26.572
So try to take butter whenever you have vishuddhi chakra problem,

01:08:26.636 --> 01:08:29.341
for physical side; I'm just telling about this.

01:08:29.900 --> 01:08:34.601
You can take some butter in water, hot water; spread it on and take it.

01:08:35.508 --> 01:08:40.687
Vishuddhi chakra looks after the cooling side.

01:08:42.070 --> 01:08:45.617
Cooling side. Because the liver when it is heat, gives heat

01:08:45.870 --> 01:08:47.437
the body becomes heated up.

01:08:48.452 --> 01:08:52.301
Then the one that really cools it down is the vishuddhi chakra

01:08:53.772 --> 01:08:59.552
and when you have a problem on the, on the drying of the epithelial

01:08:59.592 --> 01:09:03.444
cells inside, the lining, then best thing is to take some butter

01:09:04.537 --> 01:09:08.192
in the water, or eat some butter during summer time.

01:09:08.791 --> 01:09:11.744
But no carbohydrates with it. No carbohydrates.

01:09:11.993 --> 01:09:15.039
Then you won't put on weight. You eat as much as you like - butter.

01:09:15.244 --> 01:09:19.184
You will not put on weight. If you can give up carbohydrates completely

01:09:19.570 --> 01:09:22.455
you will have Satvikahara absolutely.

01:09:22.831 --> 01:09:24.689
You should not touch carbohydrates

01:09:26.056 --> 01:09:29.115
and you will be amazed that you will have Satvikahara.

01:09:29.339 --> 01:09:31.339
Take butter and proteins.

01:09:32.441 --> 01:09:36.443
Take all fats, cream, everything. Nothing will go wrong with you.

01:09:37.341 --> 01:09:40.282
You can take for proteins all dried fruits, everything

01:09:40.898 --> 01:09:46.396
and just take this honey for sweet. No carbohydrates.

01:09:47.680 --> 01:09:50.954
Or also these days honey is made out of sugar as you know.

01:09:52.052 --> 01:09:54.179
So if you can avoid carbohydrates

01:09:54.675 --> 01:09:57.939
and just take these things your health will be all right.

01:09:58.025 --> 01:10:01.467
But we have patients. We have all kinds of imbalances.

01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:04.539
That's why I say, "All right, if you have a liver take sugar."

01:10:05.090 --> 01:10:08.129
But if you just give up sugar it is not going to help.

01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:10.821
You have to first correct your liver and then you

01:10:10.860 --> 01:10:13.096
can give up sugar very easily. No problem.

01:10:13.567 --> 01:10:14.662
But not before that.

01:10:14.686 --> 01:10:17.348
Like all the doctors in general say: 'don't take sugar.'

01:10:18.085 --> 01:10:22.580
The fat goes out of the body just giving the lining of the body,

01:10:22.629 --> 01:10:24.649
the softness, and goes out of the body.

01:10:25.106 --> 01:10:26.290
It doesn't stay

01:10:26.370 --> 01:10:29.524
because if there is no carbohydrates it cannot be retained in the body.

01:10:32.329 --> 01:10:34.156
You can see at home.

01:10:34.441 --> 01:10:37.030
You put some butter on your hand. All right?

01:10:37.142 --> 01:10:39.756
And wash it. It won't wash. It will just stick there.

01:10:39.926 --> 01:10:42.819
It will have no effect - nothing, but it will be just sticking out there.

01:10:43.058 --> 01:10:44.213
It cannot be consumed.

01:10:44.453 --> 01:10:45.850
But if you put some carbohydrate

01:10:45.929 --> 01:10:47.929
say put some arta or something you can take it out.

01:10:49.081 --> 01:10:53.077
It dissolves. It cannot be dissolved if you do not take carbohydrates.

01:10:53.730 --> 01:10:57.181
But this is for people who do not have any imbalances in the body,

01:10:57.168 --> 01:10:58.485
who are perfectly all right;

01:10:58.737 --> 01:11:01.304
they can do it. I can do it but nobody allows Me.

01:11:02.992 --> 01:11:06.878
Everybody uses Me for feeding as if I am a wastepaper basket.

01:11:08.305 --> 01:11:11.827
If I don't eat... you see you are supposed to give Mother

01:11:11.867 --> 01:11:13.867
something like an aryuvedia this much.

01:11:14.326 --> 01:11:16.076
But I have seen people when they want to give Me

01:11:16.095 --> 01:11:17.831
they'll give Me so much

01:11:18.506 --> 01:11:20.520
and if I eat a little they'll feel that:

01:11:20.546 --> 01:11:22.989
'oh what Mother is ....' I don't need it actually.

01:11:23.139 --> 01:11:24.726
People should understand My nature.

01:11:25.589 --> 01:11:29.736
So when they serve Me, they'll serve so much that I cannot eat.

01:11:30.136 --> 01:11:31.933
I just eat little. I can manage.

01:11:32.248 --> 01:11:35.989
There is no need for Me to eat carbohydrates at all, at all.

01:11:36.219 --> 01:11:37.772
I need not have carbohydrates.

01:11:39.505 --> 01:11:41.505
But; 'Mother I have made this.

01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:44.999
Please have it. Mother I have made these laddhus. Please have it. Mother I have...'

01:11:45.050 --> 01:11:48.114
So I say; 'All right baba now I have to suffer to please you people.'

01:11:48.604 --> 01:11:50.072
For Priya.

01:11:53.574 --> 01:11:55.939
This is what is very simple to understand

01:11:56.637 --> 01:11:58.637
that you should not force Me to eat.

01:11:58.814 --> 01:12:00.448
At all, there's no need to force Me.

01:12:00.811 --> 01:12:03.922
Don't force anyone to eat 'though I do force people to eat

01:12:04.252 --> 01:12:06.554
because I know they need it. But you cannot do it.

01:12:06.680 --> 01:12:09.517
You have no discretion. When you have discretion,

01:12:09.799 --> 01:12:11.973
whom to force whom not to force, then it's all right.

01:12:12.582 --> 01:12:16.161
Also when you force you must know that the food has to be vibrated.

01:12:16.973 --> 01:12:19.326
If it is not vibrated food if you force the person,

01:12:19.572 --> 01:12:20.245
he'll have trouble.

01:12:24.842 --> 01:12:26.971
Now for all of you to understand

01:12:27.185 --> 01:12:29.490
the importance of vishuddhi chakra is

01:12:29.735 --> 01:12:31.933
first and foremost thing is that when you speak

01:12:31.983 --> 01:12:33.983
you must speak about Sahaja Yoga and nothing else.

01:12:36.519 --> 01:12:38.791
If you have to give speech - I have known many Sahaja Yogis

01:12:38.847 --> 01:12:41.592
you see who are still member of this organization,

01:12:41.620 --> 01:12:43.557
member of that organization,

01:12:43.637 --> 01:12:50.430
member of this thing of horrible organizations which are anti God.

01:12:51.756 --> 01:12:53.647
Say now for example we'll see

01:12:53.745 --> 01:12:57.987
Hari Rama Hari Krishna organization is anti Christ, anti.

01:12:58.088 --> 01:13:00.088
It is of course anti Christ openly

01:13:00.423 --> 01:13:03.117
and in the real sense is anti Krishna.

01:13:03.343 --> 01:13:04.486
Absolutely Krishna.

01:13:04.760 --> 01:13:07.238
Every person who goes there and begs

01:13:07.488 --> 01:13:09.916
in the name of God has a horrible vishuddhi

01:13:10.593 --> 01:13:13.397
and they all suffer ultimately from vishuddhi troubles;

01:13:13.567 --> 01:13:15.856
cancer - this that and they die.

01:13:17.748 --> 01:13:20.952
And the face of a person who has a good vishuddhi is blooming,

01:13:21.373 --> 01:13:28.373
is wide, is full of....full, full like a full moon.

01:13:29.519 --> 01:13:32.268
And if you have a face which is all shut down

01:13:32.980 --> 01:13:34.884
that means your vishuddhi is not all right.

01:13:36.010 --> 01:13:39.606
If the vishuddhi is functioning when there has to be glow on the face.

01:13:40.172 --> 01:13:44.609
The face should be full and nourished and sparkling.

01:13:45.192 --> 01:13:47.837
And eyes should be sparkling because vishuddhi chakra also

01:13:47.909 --> 01:13:52.251
looks after the eyes. It looks after the neck. It looks after the ears.

01:13:52.504 --> 01:13:53.974
It looks after the nose.

01:13:54.090 --> 01:13:56.090
If your vishuddhi chakras are spoiled

01:13:56.275 --> 01:13:58.776
you have problems with all E.N.T. things.

01:14:01.028 --> 01:14:03.724
So the people who are like that;

01:14:03.905 --> 01:14:07.221
like this you see we can say the man who was the leader

01:14:07.483 --> 01:14:08.844
of that organization.

01:14:09.185 --> 01:14:11.185
They think they are doing Hari Rama Hari Krishna.

01:14:11.210 --> 01:14:14.878
Actually they are doing absolutely anti, anti Krishna activities.

01:14:15.014 --> 01:14:17.918
Absolutely. You have no business to call

01:14:17.954 --> 01:14:19.728
Krishna's name like this, like mad,

01:14:19.787 --> 01:14:23.172
standing before all the people wearing these horrible dresses

01:14:23.325 --> 01:14:26.748
of these dhoti and kurtas and which they

01:14:26.895 --> 01:14:30.242
are absolutely done in a very funny way. They don't know how to wear it;

01:14:30.326 --> 01:14:31.863
the women wearing their saris

01:14:32.079 --> 01:14:34.514
and men buying those bhodis and

01:14:34.543 --> 01:14:37.047
putting them on their head and shaving their heads.

01:14:37.314 --> 01:14:38.620
Did Krishna shave His head?

01:14:40.064 --> 01:14:41.816
Did He ever shave His head? Head..

01:14:41.950 --> 01:14:45.416
the hair are actually the part of Krishna's gift.

01:14:45.614 --> 01:14:49.240
On the contrary He.. His hair are always described.

01:14:50.489 --> 01:14:52.026
Always described in the poetry.

01:14:56.013 --> 01:15:00.143
There is a story about a great Urdu poet

01:15:00.614 --> 01:15:04.585
who was an Indian.. who was a Hindu, but Urdu poet

01:15:04.718 --> 01:15:08.550
and some fanatics you see challenged him. So

01:15:09.086 --> 01:15:12.540
this...they put one couplet and they said: 'you better complete this.'

01:15:13.130 --> 01:15:17.358
So he said: '...'

01:15:19.039 --> 01:15:27.441
So he completed it like this: '...'

01:15:31.271 --> 01:15:34.271
His hair are described in every poetry are used.

01:15:34.457 --> 01:15:37.666
Here they are shaving their heads, putting these bhodies on their heads

01:15:37.963 --> 01:15:44.497
and walking about. When did Krishna had bald head?

01:15:44.722 --> 01:15:48.315
Did He have a bald head? He is Yogeshwera with

01:15:48.338 --> 01:15:51.364
sixteen thousand wives; means sixteen thousand powers.

01:15:51.435 --> 01:15:54.612
He didn't have Sahaja Yogis to work out, so He got them as wives.

01:15:55.045 --> 01:15:58.309
They were all yoginis within.

01:16:00.375 --> 01:16:04.650
He created all this drama and He got them as wives because

01:16:04.700 --> 01:16:07.870
a man, if he has any women as disciples,

01:16:08.329 --> 01:16:12.456
then naturally he is blamed and as a man he has to have powers

01:16:12.587 --> 01:16:16.190
in the women. Women are always the power - the shakti.

01:16:16.533 --> 01:16:18.971
So they came as His wives and He became

01:16:19.860 --> 01:16:22.293
the husband of sixteen thousand wives

01:16:22.421 --> 01:16:27.143
and the five Ranis He had were the five elements within Him.

01:16:28.776 --> 01:16:29.856
He played all the tricks.

01:16:29.876 --> 01:16:32.345
He created.....you you how will you know about Him?

01:16:32.605 --> 01:16:34.274
How far can you go understanding Him?

01:16:39.041 --> 01:16:43.507
So these people who are trying to call Shri Krishna every moment,

01:16:44.172 --> 01:16:47.877
every minute, standing on the streets and begging in His name.

01:16:47.933 --> 01:16:50.117
All over the places begging like beggars.

01:16:51.988 --> 01:16:55.488
Krishna couldn't stand begging at all. Never. He believed in

01:16:55.716 --> 01:16:59.072
having a right. He would steal than to beg.

01:17:03.123 --> 01:17:05.890
All these beggars being created in the name of God.

01:17:06.008 --> 01:17:08.008
I think is one of the greatest sins

01:17:08.594 --> 01:17:10.359
to beg in the name of God.

01:17:11.007 --> 01:17:14.208
I have seen this happening before the temples and all that

01:17:14.590 --> 01:17:17.586
and I used to think; 'before the temple in front of God

01:17:17.643 --> 01:17:23.220
to stand and beg. To be a fakir means to beg. What is this?

01:17:24.657 --> 01:17:26.657
Is this the sign of a basha.

01:17:28.497 --> 01:17:30.733
Shri Krishna was  a Batshawa, Yogeshwera

01:17:30.982 --> 01:17:34.380
and these beggars, they are the followers of Shri Krishna?'

01:17:34.552 --> 01:17:39.074
Horrible things. They look so miserable and they are

01:17:39.190 --> 01:17:42.449
absolutely like cabbages and many people believe

01:17:42.579 --> 01:17:43.946
that they are in peace.

01:17:44.626 --> 01:17:48.447
Naturally if you are living in a smashana you are in peace;

01:17:49.643 --> 01:17:54.564
in a dead condition. And our country, which is a poor country

01:17:54.615 --> 01:17:56.742
supporting all these beggars here, all our rich people

01:17:56.763 --> 01:17:58.098
have given them money and lands.

01:17:59.541 --> 01:18:02.566
Is this the way we are going to support these lamas

01:18:02.584 --> 01:18:03.978
who come down from there

01:18:04.178 --> 01:18:07.415
and these horrible people coming down

01:18:07.669 --> 01:18:12.183
from the west. All the people who cannot work.

01:18:12.442 --> 01:18:15.101
Very nice come here say: 'hari Rama hari Krishna',

01:18:15.268 --> 01:18:18.746
and read Gita and say some few words by heart

01:18:18.898 --> 01:18:21.248
and then you earn your living here - nicely living.

01:18:21.454 --> 01:18:24.535
Every village there is one or two sitting there

01:18:24.583 --> 01:18:25.949
and begging. Can you believe it?

01:18:26.235 --> 01:18:28.235
And our government is not bothered about it;

01:18:29.766 --> 01:18:34.061
to find out who are these people, why are they here?

01:18:34.150 --> 01:18:36.901
In the name of God why are they begging like this?

01:18:37.141 --> 01:18:40.028
and we have so many poor people who are

01:18:40.049 --> 01:18:42.522
begging in the name of God. Why not collect them and help them

01:18:42.726 --> 01:18:44.461
instead of helping these horrible people?

01:18:46.462 --> 01:18:49.895
Like this, you see, people have anti God activities

01:18:50.419 --> 01:18:52.226
and anti Krishna activities.

01:18:52.370 --> 01:18:58.232
When you take the name of God in vain - vishuddhi catches.

01:19:01.131 --> 01:19:04.029
I have known people sitting 'warguru warguru warguru'

01:19:04.464 --> 01:19:06.927
Is it so..Nanak Sahib is so cheap that

01:19:06.977 --> 01:19:09.201
we should go on taking His name 'warguru warguru warguru?'

01:19:09.582 --> 01:19:12.254
They'll go on having the mala in the hand all the time.

01:19:12.419 --> 01:19:17.188
What is this going on? What do you think God to be? Is He in your pocket?

01:19:17.319 --> 01:19:20.951
Is He so cheaply available that you just go on

01:19:21.197 --> 01:19:24.528
doing all these things? Why? You spoil your vishuddhi completely.

01:19:26.347 --> 01:19:29.580
One must understand. When... you see, you are surprised at...

01:19:29.908 --> 01:19:32.363
It is said that: '...'

01:19:34.073 --> 01:19:38.676
Still people start doing it. Karaka means what? Vishuddhi chakra.

01:19:39.060 --> 01:19:42.078
That's how you spoil your vishuddhi chakra. That's how you spoil your

01:19:43.960 --> 01:19:47.392
main chakra of attaining realization.

01:19:49.647 --> 01:19:52.226
So if you have to become one with the whole,

01:19:52.553 --> 01:19:54.880
please try to keep your vishuddhi chakra clear.

01:19:55.427 --> 01:19:58.461
Getting into colds because these days India

01:19:58.606 --> 01:20:00.606
especially...any, everywhere even in...

01:20:00.687 --> 01:20:04.626
women have a special tendency not to cover their body

01:20:04.794 --> 01:20:07.732
because they think they are not looking very fashionable or whatever it is.

01:20:07.849 --> 01:20:09.514
Is a very modern stuff has started

01:20:10.514 --> 01:20:14.956
that they want to wear scanty dresses. This is all anti God in both ways.

01:20:15.411 --> 01:20:17.411
Firstly it is nonsensical

01:20:17.946 --> 01:20:20.886
to show off your body. That's why Mohammed Sahib said -

01:20:20.909 --> 01:20:23.118
you see He has worked so much on vishuddhi chakra -

01:20:23.191 --> 01:20:24.624
that women should cover their body.

01:20:24.859 --> 01:20:26.568
Is a very good thing I sometimes think.

01:20:28.030 --> 01:20:31.420
This nonsense of fashion has gone to such a limit

01:20:31.832 --> 01:20:34.301
that after some time you'll find all these

01:20:34.343 --> 01:20:36.343
mosquitoes walking around without any clothes.

01:20:39.305 --> 01:20:42.291
That's the ultimate. You see is a sign of people who are,

01:20:42.368 --> 01:20:46.656
who are neither 'he' nor 'she'. The 'it' people do that way.

01:20:47.733 --> 01:20:52.095
Yes always. 'It' are the people who have qualities. That's why Rajneesh,

01:20:52.341 --> 01:20:54.341
when people go to them, they become 'it'.

01:20:55.482 --> 01:20:58.633
Because that is their capacity: no shame at all left in them.

01:21:00.554 --> 01:21:03.524
And that is what it is, one has to understand that you should be

01:21:03.581 --> 01:21:05.093
careful about your throats.

01:21:06.766 --> 01:21:08.365
The fashions and all these things

01:21:08.395 --> 01:21:11.072
are not so important. What is important is your health.

01:21:11.282 --> 01:21:13.915
If you spoil your vishuddhi it's a very wrong thing

01:21:14.161 --> 01:21:16.829
and one should try to look after vishuddhi all the time

01:21:18.264 --> 01:21:21.335
and all of you should try to look after each other's vishuddhi.

01:21:21.386 --> 01:21:24.170
Because I didn't like the idea of having this pendal here

01:21:24.265 --> 01:21:26.360
and I told the organizers this was a wrong thing.

01:21:26.899 --> 01:21:28.899
So they said; 'You said it should be in the open.' I said:

01:21:28.960 --> 01:21:31.325
'now I'm not saying you go to Himalayas.'

01:21:31.959 --> 01:21:34.545
You must use discretion. That's the part missing.

01:21:37.015 --> 01:21:38.086
You must have discretion.

01:21:38.784 --> 01:21:44.324
To give people a thing in the mid-winter such a place;

01:21:44.360 --> 01:21:47.518
I mean I must say you people are great seekers to be here.

01:21:48.132 --> 01:21:50.961
This is not proper thing to do. So the organizers,

01:21:51.152 --> 01:21:53.074
the people who are dealing with the collectivity,

01:21:53.121 --> 01:21:57.247
must know that they should do something to protect the throat of people,

01:21:57.507 --> 01:22:01.654
to protect the vishuddhu chakra. It's very important.

01:22:02.826 --> 01:22:05.570
Very important and you all know how I

01:22:05.715 --> 01:22:09.554
care for your vishuddhi chakras; everybody's vishuddhi chakra.

01:22:09.838 --> 01:22:12.586
Because I know how important it is. Because it will

01:22:12.895 --> 01:22:15.132
make you absolutely disintegrated

01:22:16.157 --> 01:22:18.733
and it will spoil all the work of Kundalini

01:22:18.804 --> 01:22:20.320
and poor Kundalini will suffer so.

01:22:21.971 --> 01:22:24.760
So we have to take it upon yourselves

01:22:25.076 --> 01:22:27.076
that we'll keep our vishuddhi chakra clean.

01:22:27.371 --> 01:22:29.371
We'll clean ourselves properly

01:22:29.558 --> 01:22:32.357
and we'll clean our throats every morning

01:22:32.500 --> 01:22:36.311
and we'll take gargling and everything and look after our vishuddhi chakra.

01:22:36.436 --> 01:22:38.420
It looks very mundane but for a Mother

01:22:38.586 --> 01:22:41.236
mundane things are as important as higher things are.

01:22:41.544 --> 01:22:43.363
Because if there is no vishuddhi chakra

01:22:43.646 --> 01:22:48.727
what's the use of coming to Sahaja Yoga -  with a bad vishuddhi chakra?

01:22:50.384 --> 01:22:53.142
So please try to look after your vishuddhi chakra.

01:22:53.626 --> 01:22:55.626
Try to put Yogeshwera there.

01:22:56.470 --> 01:23:00.862
Try to raise Shri Krishna there, try to be like Him.

01:23:01.808 --> 01:23:05.461
Keep your understanding that

01:23:05.678 --> 01:23:08.760
you are here to witness the drama of God

01:23:09.102 --> 01:23:14.634
and to be the murlee of Shri Krishna to watch

01:23:15.251 --> 01:23:17.131
the beautiful melody flowing through you.

01:23:19.035 --> 01:23:21.961
May God bless you all.

01:23:28.333 --> 01:23:31.159
Now what is today also

01:23:31.389 --> 01:23:33.926
they don't want anyone to touch My feet. I hope

01:23:34.061 --> 01:23:40.299
today you will obey without any exception.

01:23:40.575 --> 01:23:41.785
Yesterday we tried

01:23:42.239 --> 01:23:45.010
but there were exceptions so today there should be no apowadas.

01:23:45.070 --> 01:23:45.800
Let us see.

01:23:46.262 --> 01:23:49.457
One day we should not touch Mother's feet. Doesn't matter.

01:23:49.533 --> 01:23:50.760
You all can touch from there

01:23:51.119 --> 01:23:54.139
and there is a way of collectively touching Mother's feet

01:23:54.312 --> 01:23:56.972
is the way we do always. You can all do it

01:23:57.097 --> 01:24:00.893
just now but we need not actually touch, but you are actually touching.

01:24:02.054 --> 01:24:04.372
Even touching the mother earth you are touching.

01:24:05.494 --> 01:24:08.328
Just touch the mother earth and you are there.

01:24:15.190 --> 01:24:18.881
Just touch the mother earth; you will find the Kundalini rising.

01:24:27.330 --> 01:24:30.087
You haven't given Me any questions whatsoever

01:24:30.397 --> 01:24:33.739
and those who have questions should write questions and give it to Me,

01:24:34.050 --> 01:24:35.710
because once I'll go away then you will say:

01:24:35.747 --> 01:24:40.959
'Mother never allowed us to ask any questions.' I did say there are....
