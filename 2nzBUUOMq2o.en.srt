ETVD Unknown TC:BC 13-09-2015

3
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:43,640
Today we have gathered here to worship Shri G anesha.

4
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:52,640
You all know what a powerful deity He is.

5
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,979
His power comes from his innocence.

6
00:00:58,139 --> 00:01:02,781
When we see small children we are automatically

7
00:01:02,941 --> 00:01:06,400
compelled towards them

8
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:13,920
and also we want to love them, kiss them and be with them.

9
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,840
And very innocent they are,

10
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,440
extremely innocent,

11
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:28,960
and when we worship Shri Ganesha

12
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:35,920
we have to know if we have been really innocent or not.

13
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:42,800
These days people have become extremely cunning,

14
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,600
and they don’t mind any amount of cunning.

15
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:50,160
They play all kinds of cunning games on others

16
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,200
who are innocent and simple.

17
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,600
They can justify themselves always

18
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:02,680
that whatever they are doing is the right thing in these modern times

19
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,960
when everybody is so cunning.

20
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:16,200
This cunningness can take you to the other extreme of right side,

21
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,520
which is very much punishable,

22
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:25,360
in the sense that some people develop all kinds of problems,

23
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,360
which are physical, you can say.

24
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:37,680
Like their hands can get paralyzed or their leg can get paralyzed.

25
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,880
Also, they can have other troubles

26
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:45,560
with their liver treatments and all that.

27
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:51,600
All this comes up. Then to punish them

28
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:57,280
a disease of psychosomatic nature might set in.

29
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,680
At this time, when you have these problems,

30
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,080
all such people, who suffer from the right side,

31
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:07,120
should worship Shri Ganesha.

32
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:14,680
For example these days, life is very much busy with all of you.

33
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:20,160
You are extremely busy with your work and you are doing

34
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:24,360
extra work, I should say, than normal.

35
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,080
But you think you are doing a very great job of God.

36
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:33,520
As a result Shri Ganesha is neglected

37
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:41,000
and such a man can become either very dry or very self indulgent.

38
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,800
One of the two things come up

39
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:48,120
and he does not know where he is going.

40
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:54,320
The only thing that keeps you in the middle,

41
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,960
in Sahaja Yoga, is Shri Ganesha’s Puja,

42
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:06,320
Shri Ganesha’s worship by which you can always be in the center.

43
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,677
All these diseases of the right side

44
00:04:09,837 --> 00:04:14,240
can be cured by Shri Ganesha’s Puja.

45
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:20,200
Now there are various ways people worship Shri Ganesha

46
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:27,640
but there is a simple way to remember him

47
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:33,200
and sit before his photograph and take vibrations from him.

48
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,120
That’s the best way you can balance yourself.

49
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:42,040
There are so many worries, there are so many struggles you have.

50
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,880
All these can be neutralized by Shri Ganesha.

51
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,760
Though innocent, He is extremely clever

52
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:55,600
and when he comes to your help you are amazed.

53
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:00,560
How he works it out and how he removes all the hurdles

54
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,240
and all the worries from you.

55
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:07,320
So this is the most important deity we have.

56
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,680
Though its a very simple deity.

57
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:14,360
This Mooladhara chakra is very very complicated.

58
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,720
It is one of the most complicated, chakras I think,

59
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:26,400
because it has many waves, it has many compartments.

60
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:33,400
We can say which all the time are vibrating and oscillating.

61
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,280
So to steady down these

62
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:43,480
you should try to be absolutely dedicated to Shri Ganesha.

63
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:50,680
Shri Ganesha, as I told you, was incarnated as Jesus Christ,

64
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,640
and Jesus was also a very innocent person.

65
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,800
If he was not innocent, He would not have been crucified,

66
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:04,120
but he was not a cunning fellow to see the cunning of others.

67
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:09,520
His own disciple deceived him and still he knew who it was,

68
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,640
he never said who it was.

69
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:16,600
If you see his life, its full of innocent beauty,

70
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:23,200
is such a simple hearted personality, such a good personality

71
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,080
and wherever he saw anything wrong done

72
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,920
he used to go all out to fight it.

73
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,040
Same is Shri Ganesha.

74
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:36,120
Shri Ganesha’s blessings are very important for all the people

75
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:41,160
who are specially prone to some sort of a hurdle

76
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:44,480
or ‘Sankata as they call it’. He is called as Sankata Vimochan,

77
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:49,320
the one who takes you out of all the hurdles of life.

78
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:53,760
So many of you have experienced how he has helped you

79
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:58,520
in different troubles and hurdles and also

80
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:02,160
different type of very very difficult times.

81
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:06,760
It is his style that he manages things so well

82
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,600
because he is a Ganapati.

83
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:15,720
Ganapati means the one who is the Lord of the Ganas.

84
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:20,480
As I have told you Ganas exist within us.

85
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:28,640
Very nicely settled down as these bodies, small, small bodies

86
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,720
who report if there is any problem.

87
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:37,000
They report to the brain that there is a problem

88
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:43,800
and on the sternum bone is the residence

89
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:49,600
or you can say the throne of the Goddess Durga.

90
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:58,600
So whenever there is any problem we are found into some trouble,

91
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:02,320
sternum bone starts vibrating

92
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:08,960
and these bodies which are Ganas get the information.

93
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,120
Antibodies they are called in the medical terminology.

94
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:18,240
Then these Ganas attack. They can target also.

95
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,360
They know how to target the troubles and attack it,

96
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:26,480
one may think that only the people who are suffering medically

97
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,280
are helped by Ganas is not true.

98
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,760
Also the people who are mentally upset,

99
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:37,640
who are mentally suffering are also helped by the Ganas.

100
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:42,920
These Ganas are so good at targeting their problems

101
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:48,000
that sometimes we are surprised how things are worked out.

102
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:54,640
For example say something happens to someone, some child, somewhere.

103
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,440
Now his parents start crying for Mother

104
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,560
and the Mother is the Durga say, then what happens,

105
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:07,320
that they immediately rush to that place

106
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:11,960
and miraculously they cure the boy, miraculously they say.

107
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:15,720
So many miraculous thing that have happened in your life

108
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:22,520
you cannot explain, but they are all due to this Ganapati’s Ganas.

109
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:26,280
They are also small like him

110
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:30,040
and they are very active and very alert.

111
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,160
They never sleep.

112
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,360
Anytime there is any trouble these Ganas will go

113
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:41,360
and attack the problem and find out solution for him.

114
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:47,680
It is something unbelievable how they act and how they inform.

115
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:52,080
I can give you so many examples that have happened like this.

116
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,400
For example there was a boy who got drowned

117
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:02,800
in one of our ashrams in America in the swimming pool.

118
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,880
They were all jumping in the swimming pool,

119
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,600
I didn’t like the idea of swimming pool very much

120
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,920
because there were children.

121
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,640
So one boy fell down into that

122
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,000
and was inside for about 15 to 20 minutes.

123
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,120
Nobody knew he was there.

124
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:23,800
So then they tried to find out the body of the boy

125
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:27,520
and then they found out he was not there. Where has he gone?

126
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:32,480
Then they discovered that he was in that swimming pool.

127
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,160
After that they got so frightened

128
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,920
and they said we just prayed to you, Mother to save this boy.

129
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,600
Surprisingly, I never telephone to any Ashram,

130
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:45,030
I didn’t know even the address.

131
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:49,600
But I asked to telephone to this number,

132
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,680
on my own. I don’t know anybody’s numbers

133
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:58,440
and, when I telephoned, one of the leaders came there

134
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,680
and I told him I know the boy has fallen into the water

135
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,400
and he will be saved.

136
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,560
Nobody had told me anything.

137
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,320
“Don’t worry he will be perfectly alright.”

138
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:13,160
Then they brought out the boy and he was treated

139
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:17,200
by the doctors also but also with vibrations

140
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,880
and today that boy is perfectly alright,

141
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,920
while the doctors had said he can never survive.

142
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,520
If there is one chance of his surviving,

143
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:30,600
he will be like a dead body, in a coma all the time.

144
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:33,720
This boy, I have met him this time, when I went to America.

145
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,800
So, like this, so many things happen

146
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:41,920
and people tell me that Mother its your ‘kripa’,

147
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:45,520
your blessings that this has happened.

148
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,520
In a way, it is very distantly, I should say,

149
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:51,120
but because of Shri Ganesha.

150
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,760
Now Shri Ganesha’s another quality is that

151
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,280
he is extremely obedient to Mother.

152
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:03,280
He does not recognize even Shiva, Vihnu, any one.

153
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,880
To him his Mother is everything.

154
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,040
So he can fight with his father, Shiva,

155
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:15,720
he can fight with anyone because to him is complete obedience

156
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:23,240
and absolutely quick ‘Tatpar’, just quickly understands

157
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:28,000
what is the desire of the Mother and he works it out.

158
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:33,560
His style is otherwise very innocent, simple, child like

159
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,880
but His work is tremendous.

160
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:41,760
Now these Ganas are also very innocent people, very innocent

161
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:47,680
but when told that you have to attend to a particular problem,

162
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:51,520
they are extremely quick and they are very fast.

163
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:57,800
The another thing within is that he respects people who are chaste,

164
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:02,480
who have chastity as the prime thing in their life.

165
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:05,080
Chastity is very much worshipped by him.

166
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:08,240
Its not only in women but also in men,

167
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,560
he expects chastity to be present.

168
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:16,920
After getting realization you should be absolutely chaste people,

169
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:20,320
you shouldn’t have your eyes rolling around every where

170
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:26,400
and sort of what you can call a very bad method

171
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,720
of communicating with young women and young men

172
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,640
and spoiling your chastity.

173
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,640
Even your eyes should be clean,

174
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,320
even your thoughts should be cleaned.

175
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:43,400
For that you should introspect and see for yourself

176
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:46,000
what mistakes you have committed

177
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:53,000
and what kind of an unchaste behavior you have.

178
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:58,440
You have to correct yourself and ask Shri Ganesha to forgive you.

179
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,960
If you ask for forgiveness, he can forgive anything.

180
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:06,360
He is so innocent and beautiful that he forgives you,

181
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:09,160
but that is a very important thing.

182
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:14,480
Our whole morality depends on our idea of chastity.

183
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,200
We should be very chaste.

184
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:20,400
So many religions have come and they have talked about chastity.

185
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,200
But religions have become so useless now,

186
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,640
have become without any basis,

187
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:38,320
without any proper execution, of what is written for them.

188
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,880
They do all kinds of things and they call themselves

189
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:46,240
Hindus, Muslims, Christians, all kinds of religions.

190
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,440
Actually the religions have failed completely

191
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,440
and that’s why Shri Ganesha gets after them.

192
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,720
Another thing about Shri Ganesh

193
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,080
is that he is created out of the Mother earth.

194
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,760
He is absolutely created out of the mother Earth.

195
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:10,600
So if he doesn’t like people of some country,

196
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:15,560
who are doing black magic, or who are doing fundamentalism

197
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:22,320
and where people are also having very bad morals.

198
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:27,120
He creates problems for them. What happens that

199
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:34,160
He tells the Mother earth to create the earthquakes.

200
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,704
Earthquake takes place in places where

201
00:15:36,864 --> 00:15:40,520
there is no respect of chastity,

202
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:44,520
also where there are fundamentalist

203
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:51,520
and also where there are people who are worshipping the black magic.

204
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:56,440
This kind of people are attacked by him through his Mother.

205
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,880
So the Mother earth also understands.

206
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,480
Now we have so many earthquakes,

207
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,920
one in Turkey you know, one in Taiwan,

208
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:08,080
but not a single Sahaja Yogi has died.

209
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,000
So he protects them.

210
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:14,880
He has discrimination and only such people, who are of this kind,

211
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,080
he tries to destroy them,

212
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:21,200
and he has destroyed many like this even before.

213
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:32,120
Also, the Mother earth’s powers he has got, is that he is magnetic,

214
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:35,000
he attracts people towards himself,

215
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:40,000
people take to him very easily as we take to children very easily.

216
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:44,800
So that is magnetic power that he has got within himself.

217
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:50,480
Now, you will be surprised this magnet exists also in the birds,

218
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,680
also in many animals but specially in the birds.

219
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:57,400
That’s how they can follow direction where they have to go.

220
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:02,160
They are flying from, say Siberia, all the way, flying to Australia.

221
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,880
How do they fly? And again they come back to the same place.

222
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:12,560
It also is in the fishes. Fishes also are found say

223
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:17,480
in the waters which are coming from some hills,

224
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:22,040
so they come to the plains for some time and again God knows how,

225
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,360
they go back to their own place.

226
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:27,720
So going back to the same place is only possible

227
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,720
if there is a way of knowing the direction.

228
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:35,160
But they know the direction, they have a sense of direction,

229
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:39,280
also they are bound by their own qualities.

230
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:44,320
For example a snake will be a snake, a dog will be a dog,

231
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,720
and a lion will be a lion.

232
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,480
But human beings have perhaps all the animals within them.

233
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,760
So they could be anything, you can’t say

234
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:56,800
and they are too cunning to admit that they can be anything.

235
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,560
And once they become anything like that

236
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:04,320
you are amazed how these people can be of such a low level

237
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,880
when they are human beings.

238
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:11,640
But it is so because Ganesha has not been respected in their lives.

239
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:16,720
So they can go to any level, any place. Another example,

240
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:21,200
I give you a very big earthquake we had in India, in Latur.

241
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:26,200
In Latur this was the fourteenth day of Shri Ganesha

242
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:29,280
where they take Shri Ganesha and put it in the sea

243
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,880
or in the water of a river. So there, in Latur,

244
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:41,720
these people have been having a nice statue of Shri Ganesha.

245
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,920
Before the statue they dance

246
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:50,480
and they have now started playing very dirty, very bad,

247
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:56,160
music from some very funny films or something.

248
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,280
It’s so bad that you just can’t bear it.

249
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,560
Very bad and that upsets Shri Ganesha.

250
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:07,920
So like that they were doing to this one statue that they had

251
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,360
and they were dancing before it.

252
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:16,120
But when they put the statue in the water and they came back home,

253
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:20,560
they got drunk and when they got drunk, they started dancing

254
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:25,080
with that drinking and saying Jai Ganesha, Jai Ganesha.

255
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:28,720
At that time the earth moved

256
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:38,480
and the earthquake took away all of them inside the earth itself.

257
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,960
They all disappeared into earth.

258
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,280
Apart from that there were many others also

259
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:48,680
who were doing this kind of thing, were taken into the mother earth.

260
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:52,520
And our Ashram was there, a kind of a center

261
00:19:52,680 --> 00:20:00,280
and around the center there was a very beautiful land

262
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:06,360
but he did not touch that land. Around is about at least

263
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:11,640
quite a long distance, a big gap came in

264
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:20,920
and there was a opening in the mother earth all around the center

265
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:26,040
and nobody was harmed: They were all at home.

266
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,520
They were all right.

267
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:33,640
But this happened, that our Ashram was not at all touched

268
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,316
and this is how they saved the Ashram

269
00:20:36,476 --> 00:20:39,280
and not a single Sahaja Yogi died.

270
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,680
It is really very remarkable how the protection is given

271
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:47,600
by Shri Ganesha and his Ganas.

272
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,240
So we must respect his Ganas,

273
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:55,000
very important is to see that they are all around within us,

274
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,200
they are acting within us.

275
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,520
They see us what sort of person you are,

276
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:05,440
and in case you try to dislodge Shri Ganesha

277
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,603
by your misbehavior

278
00:21:07,763 --> 00:21:12,040
they try to see that you again go back to normal.

279
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,200
They give you a chance many a times.

280
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:21,840
But even then you go on with your cunning and ideas about your ego,

281
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:28,560
you are very badly hit by him and that is the biggest,

282
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,640
I should say, calamity for you people.

283
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,400
So you must worship Shri Ganesha

284
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,800
but I always say don’t worship every Shri Ganesha

285
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:44,360
which is being created by those, we can say, artisans.

286
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:47,560
Because God knows what sort of Artisans they are.

287
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,240
For money’s sake they might be making Ganesha

288
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:56,800
and they might not have got any idea of Chastity.

289
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:01,760
Such people make these Ganesha and then you worship those Ganeshas,

290
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,640
so we are not at all helped by this.

291
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,520
That’s why Mohammad Saheb has said,

292
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:11,440
don’t do any worship of any idol

293
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:15,320
because these idols have been created by human beings

294
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:20,120
who are not authorized to do that. They are not Swayambhus.

295
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,600
They are not created by the mother earth

296
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,519
but are copied by people

297
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:29,160
who are just wanting to make money out of them.

298
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:32,960
So that’s, how any idol you get,

299
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:39,240
say, from the shops need not be worshiped,

300
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:42,600
it is not to be worshiped, any idol whatsoever.

301
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:45,440
So whatever is not there,

302
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,640
we should not worship because it is made by somebody

303
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:53,240
who has very bad vibrations, who is a cheat,

304
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:57,360
who is very cunning and thinks no end of himself.

305
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,760
With such a person if you buy a Shri Ganesha

306
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,800
it is going to harm you, is not going to help you.

307
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:08,600
You can have it for decoration in the house but not for worship.

308
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:12,640
There is no photograph of real Shri Ganesha, no photograph.

309
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:19,120
There are eight Shri Ganeshas who came out of mother earth.

310
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:24,520
I have seen them. But in those places the pujaris,

311
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:28,800
the people who are the priest are horrible, horrible people.

312
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:33,480
I went to one of them and he said, “I am getting Asthama”,

313
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:38,400
“I am getting paralysis, how is it I am worshipping Shri Ganesha,

314
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:41,600
my forefathers have worshipped Shri Ganesha

315
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,800
and how he is doing this to us.”

316
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:51,320
I said, you just introspect yourself, what kind of a life you lead,

317
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:57,560
what do you do, are you really worthy of Shri Ganesha’s Pujari?

318
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,080
And then he realized it.

319
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,920
I said, “I will cure you now. Its all right

320
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:07,360
but afterwards you see to it that you become an innocent personality.

321
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:11,800
Try to lead an innocent life, not of outwitting another

322
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,480
and being very cunning and clever.

323
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:19,200
Shri Ganesha’s troubles, are really, I can’t count them even,

324
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:26,640
how much it can hamper, or how much it can give you trouble,

325
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:32,160
how much it can take you nearer to your death.

326
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:37,400
He is so powerful, because all his energy is

327
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:40,680
for the divine work of his Mother, all his energy.

328
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:43,600
He doesn’t do anything, he doesn’t want anything.

329
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:50,000
Just all his energy is for that and he is asking for what is simple,

330
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:53,240
what you can call Modaka, a kind of a thing

331
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:58,920
they make out of coconut. That’s what he eats.

332
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:05,960
His body is so subtle and so, so powerful

333
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:14,360
that he can move mountains after mountains.

334
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:20,920
With his simplicity, with his sweetness, and with his innocence

335
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:28,240
he can really change people. People who are very harsh,

336
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,520
can be changed.

337
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:37,240
His symbol as we have seen is a Swastika,

338
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,480
of the right direction.

339
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:45,520
But if it is the other way round Swastika, then that can destroy.

340
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:50,080
When It was used by Hitler in the beginning,

341
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,600
it was the right type and he was successful.

342
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,760
But then what happened, they had stencils

343
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:59,520
and they started using it from the other side.

344
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:02,800
So it was from the left side, they started other way round

345
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,080
and then they were all destroyed.

346
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:10,200
How powerful is Shri Ganesha’s Swastika, you can say.

347
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,448
Also we have proved now

348
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:16,560
that Swastika if you see from left to the right,

349
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,280
is actually from the Carbon atom.

350
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:23,000
The carbon atom has got Swastika

351
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:29,960
and the whole of this chakra is made of Carbon atoms,

352
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:32,000
all put in series.

353
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:37,320
Now if you look at it from the left side, you have proved it now,

354
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:40,040
look at it from the left side to right side,

355
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:44,040
what you see is Omkar.

356
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,840
If you see it from right side to left side,

357
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,600
you see the Swastika,

358
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:55,480
and if you see from down below upward then it looks like a Cross.

359
00:26:55,640 --> 00:27:00,840
So it proves that Shri Ganesha incarnated as Christ

360
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,680
and he is the one who is worshipped all over the world,

361
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:09,280
is already written in the Devi Mahatmayam if you read it,

362
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:13,360
is all clearly written about him how he became an egg

363
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,680
and out of the half of the egg became Christ

364
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:21,440
and half of the egg was Shri Ganesha.

365
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,640
All these things are there but we cannot understand it

366
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,400
because we are confused.

367
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,680
We don’t want to see it in a proper sense

368
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,720
that this is already written there.

369
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:37,320
So those who worship Christ, also worship Shri Ganesha

370
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:44,720
and whatever you say to Christ you are saying it to Shri Ganesha.

371
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:51,000
They are not two, they are one and absolutely one with each other.

372
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:54,000
All the things I have told you about Christ,

373
00:27:54,160 --> 00:28:00,480
you can try to find out and you will prove it.

374
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,640
Like Christ had these two fingers,

375
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:08,120
this means one finger is for the Vishudhi as we say Shri Krishna

376
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:12,760
and this one is Vishnu’s means this is his father’s.

377
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:16,640
That means his father was Vishnu or Shri Krishna.

378
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:20,320
Very clearly he used to do, why didn’t he use other fingers,

379
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,080
only these two fingers why did he use.

380
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,905
Pointing out towards his father

381
00:28:26,065 --> 00:28:29,980
who was Shri Vishnu and Shri Krishna.

382
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,560
It is easy to understand what I am saying,

383
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:37,040
if you see the vibrations of Shri Ganesha.

384
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:43,880
If you see his vibrations and think of him you will be amazed,

385
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:49,440
that your Agnya will open out, you will become thoughtless,

386
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:53,600
because he is the Jesus and he is on the Agnya.

387
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,536
So it all opens out

388
00:28:55,696 --> 00:29:01,112
and all the stupid ideas about wrecking the Agnya,

389
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:05,240
this and that is all neutralized because you see for yourself,

390
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:10,520
just the name of Shri Ganesha can open your Agnya.

391
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:14,680
The cunningness that comes from Agnya is absolutely finished.

392
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,640
You are no more cunning.

393
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:23,360
When you see this innocence on your forehead,

394
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:28,600
you are amazed at yourself and all such ideas just disappear.

395
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:33,760
You cannot think of something very cunning and harmful to others.

396
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:40,720
You are completely changed when the Agnya is absolutely opened out.

397
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:45,600
This one is a very big blessing to us that we all have

398
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:49,960
this Muladhara Chakra now put into proper thing.

399
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:53,160
When you sit on the ground also it helps more

400
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:59,371
because the mother of Shri Ganesha

401
00:29:59,531 --> 00:30:03,291
is this Prithvi, is this earth, the mother earth

402
00:30:03,451 --> 00:30:06,880
and that’s why we should look after the mother earth.

403
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:09,040
We don’t look after the mother earth.

404
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,520
We don’t understand the value of mother earth.

405
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:16,640
Actually in Indian culture it is that

406
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:19,800
when you are getting up in the morning,

407
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:24,880
you must say Namaskar to the Mother earth

408
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:29,320
because saying that I bow to you, O, Mother earth

409
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:32,560
because I am touching you with my feet.

410
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,040
Such respect you should have for Mother earth,

411
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,920
then you won’t exploit it,

412
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:40,680
you won’t have today’s problems of pollution and this and that.

413
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:43,680
It all comes out of our ignorance

414
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:48,240
that the Mother earth is the mother of Shri Ganesha

415
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:52,080
who’s chakra we have got as Mooladhara.

416
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:56,720
If you understand this you will be able to understand,

417
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,800
what is to be done.

418
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:02,880
The mother earth itself we should look after,

419
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:06,640
we can glorify her, we can beautify her,

420
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,040
we can do all kinds of things

421
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:14,720
but the way we are exploiting the mother earth is a wrong idea,

422
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:19,560
is very wrong because it is harming us with pollution.

423
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:22,800
To cut down the trees, to cut down every thing

424
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:27,520
that mother has produced and just to use it for money

425
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,560
is a very wrong thing.

426
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:33,320
One should think about it and when you cut one tree also

427
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,480
you should put another one there.

428
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:39,000
That is the beauty of the Mother earth,

429
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:43,600
all the greenery, every thing is the beauty of the Mother earth.

430
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:51,200
Many people have no interest in gardening or in nature, no interest.

431
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,560
I don’t know how they live but they do

432
00:31:54,720 --> 00:32:00,720
without taking any interest in gardening or in the nature.

433
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:04,760
Nature is so beautiful, just look at the nature,

434
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:10,800
it is never smelling, is never dirty, every leaf is so organized

435
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,960
that it should get the sunrays.

436
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,680
There is no quarrel about it.

437
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:19,480
They are so well organized, everything is so beautiful

438
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:24,760
and it is never destroyed also by any animals. You will be amazed.

439
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:27,120
The animals also don’t destroy,

440
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:30,320
at the most they might eat some grass or something,

441
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:34,160
but normally animals do not destroy any tree,

442
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,800
do not destroy anything

443
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:42,840
as we destroy the Mother earth for our own use.

444
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,120
Whatever may be the cry for this,

445
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:50,040
we have to understand that we have to respect to the Mother earth.

446
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:53,040
Mother earth is the mother of Shri Ganesha,

447
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:57,160
who is our, you should say the eldest Sahaja Yogi.

448
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:02,160
He never had to take to yoga but he is in Yoga all the time.

449
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,720
He is the greatest yogi we have

450
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:08,320
and the way he is doing right things all the time.

451
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:14,600
He never does anything wrong, never and he is so capable

452
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:23,120
of getting to the position of any great deity that is possible,

453
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:26,000
I would say. He is the greatest deity we have

454
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,120
and we should really worship him.

455
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:30,930
Through him all deities are worshiped

456
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:38,320
and are made happy and blissful.

457
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:43,960
So this is today’s thing was that I was just thinking that

458
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:49,240
nowadays, in modern times how we have become shameless,

459
00:33:49,400 --> 00:34:00,520
how we have tried to trouble our chastity, for kind of a honor.

460
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:05,160
If we have any honor you will have the chastity

461
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:08,320
but you are dishonoring yourself

462
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,920
and you think you have been very very smart and modern

463
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:17,760
by becoming so sinful.

464
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:21,400
All the sinful act that is going on in these modern times

465
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:27,800
is absolutely wrong and it should be completely, we should abhor it.

466
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:31,440
You should go no way near because that’s all wrong

467
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:35,120
and that’s how Shri Ganesha gets angry.

468
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:39,200
Decency is very important in understanding,

469
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:45,360
what is our important basis, is our chastity.

470
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:51,880
In India you know thirty two thousand women got themselves burnt

471
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:56,120
for saving their chastity. I come from the same family

472
00:34:56,280 --> 00:35:00,040
and you can imagine what courage they must be having,

473
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:04,438
what faith they must be having, in their chastity

474
00:35:04,598 --> 00:35:08,273
that if we lose our chastity what’s the use of our life.

475
00:35:08,433 --> 00:35:14,209
So they cared for their chastity, have done so much sacrifice

476
00:35:14,369 --> 00:35:18,760
to show that chastity is the most important thing, we all should have.

477
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:23,663
Its not only for women but also for men, very much more for men.

478
00:35:23,823 --> 00:35:26,051
Shri Ganesha is very important thing

479
00:35:26,211 --> 00:35:28,673
because men can develop so many diseases

480
00:35:28,833 --> 00:35:32,481
if they do not respect Shri Ganesha.

481
00:35:33,322 --> 00:35:40,377
Our health would be the best if we look after Shri Ganesha

482
00:35:40,537 --> 00:35:43,736
because he is all the time repairing our body.

483
00:35:43,896 --> 00:35:47,581
He is all the time looking after, protecting us

484
00:35:47,741 --> 00:35:53,592
and our Shri Ganesha is in the Mooladhara.

485
00:35:53,752 --> 00:35:56,505
He is the one who is looking after our Kundalini,

486
00:35:56,665 --> 00:35:59,040
he is protecting our Kundalini.

487
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:05,779
If any thing happens to us the Kundalini comes up

488
00:36:05,939 --> 00:36:11,537
but the one who supports her and, keeps her up,

489
00:36:11,697 --> 00:36:15,981
awakened and standing is Shri Ganesha. He works it out.

490
00:36:16,141 --> 00:36:20,160
He is the one who is the protector of our Kundalini

491
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:27,181
which is also a basis of your self realization.

492
00:36:27,341 --> 00:36:30,779
So how much important is Shri Ganesha you should know,

493
00:36:30,939 --> 00:36:33,716
and you should find out about yourself,

494
00:36:33,876 --> 00:36:38,495
introspect that are we really dedicated to Shri Ganesha?

495
00:36:38,655 --> 00:36:41,040
If we are; what are we doing about it?

496
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:47,381
Then you will develop a real hatred for all these dirty things.

497
00:36:47,541 --> 00:36:50,303
You will not like them, will not like such people.

498
00:36:50,463 --> 00:36:53,585
That is how a Sahaja Yogi should work it out.

499
00:36:53,745 --> 00:36:56,659
The children are the best as we know.

500
00:36:56,819 --> 00:37:04,246
Children are so sweet and so kind, they are so loving, so beautiful.

501
00:37:04,406 --> 00:37:08,621
In the same way we should know Shri Ganesha is there.

502
00:37:08,781 --> 00:37:12,116
He is the one who is really innocent

503
00:37:12,276 --> 00:37:16,524
but extremely, protective of you,

504
00:37:16,684 --> 00:37:20,158
very much protective, with his innocence.

505
00:37:20,318 --> 00:37:22,894
So we should also try to cherish our innocence

506
00:37:23,054 --> 00:37:26,800
and not to feel hurt because sometime such people are cheated,

507
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,644
dominated, every thing happens, doesn’t matter.

508
00:37:29,804 --> 00:37:33,094
They will all suffer who will dominate innocent people.

509
00:37:33,254 --> 00:37:38,315
As the whole world, you see, there is a big uproar about it,

510
00:37:38,475 --> 00:37:40,640
people are talking about it that

511
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,864
there should not be domination of the innocent simple people.

512
00:37:45,024 --> 00:37:48,219
It has happened but it all has to be changed,

513
00:37:48,379 --> 00:37:55,160
has to be brought to some last end otherwise people can not exist,

514
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:59,878
like everywhere they went and oppressed so many people.

515
00:38:00,038 --> 00:38:03,688
In America, I was surprised to see that

516
00:38:03,848 --> 00:38:06,600
there were so many Red Indians,

517
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:10,600
who are called as Indian Americans.

518
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:15,887
They were all oppressed so much that they had to run away

519
00:38:16,047 --> 00:38:20,198
to different places and then I went to this place Canajoharie.

520
00:38:20,358 --> 00:38:23,000
I found the vibrations were so good.

521
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:25,800
That means they were very innocent, simple people

522
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:28,979
and Americans that time, who went there,

523
00:38:29,139 --> 00:38:32,000
tried to completely finish them.

524
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:35,489
So they went and hid in places like Canajoharie

525
00:38:35,649 --> 00:38:39,240
but the Canajoharie has such tremendous vibrations

526
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:42,250
that I said look at this, so many years have passed,

527
00:38:42,410 --> 00:38:46,120
still the people who live there or worked about

528
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:51,421
and were absolutely enjoying this place were Red Indians,

529
00:38:51,581 --> 00:38:56,154
the ones who were Indians, we call them American Indians.

530
00:38:56,314 --> 00:38:58,489
But they are so simple and innocent

531
00:38:58,649 --> 00:39:01,600
and they were so, I think, spiritual people

532
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,400
because they used to worship the Mother.

533
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:07,200
All the time they worship the Mother.

534
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:10,960
Even I have seen in other countries it has happened

535
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:16,220
but I was happy to see that in Australia they are very secular.

536
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:19,180
They have many Maoris and all those people

537
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:21,060
and they encourage all of them

538
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:25,060
and its so surprising that they have so much talent

539
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:32,303
and they are bringing them to this state to show

540
00:39:32,469 --> 00:39:37,176
that they are equal in their rights, political rights, in Australia.

541
00:39:37,336 --> 00:39:39,540
Its a very good venture.

542
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:46,420
Now this Ganesha has appeared in Australia is as Uluru,

543
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:51,239
is a very big mountain which looks like Shri Ganesha.

544
00:39:51,399 --> 00:39:56,318
It has also a very big trunk, going down.

545
00:39:56,478 --> 00:40:00,580
Vibrations itself will prove that it is Shri Ganesha,

546
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:01,980
from the mother earth.

547
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:05,900
He has appeared in many places, Shri Ganesha not only there.

548
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:13,220
But there I felt is really the source, source of vibrations.

549
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:15,016
That’s what it is.

550
00:40:15,176 --> 00:40:19,856
And in Australia I thank him that because of him only

551
00:40:20,016 --> 00:40:23,580
Sahaja Yoga has worked so well and so easily,

552
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:26,081
and Government also has never troubled us

553
00:40:26,241 --> 00:40:28,696
or there has been no problem with them.

554
00:40:28,856 --> 00:40:31,401
I don’t know what’s this helping them

555
00:40:31,561 --> 00:40:35,921
but perhaps it is Shri Ganesha as Uluru

556
00:40:36,081 --> 00:40:40,370
which is protecting Sahaja Yoga there and is growing so much.

557
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:44,421
In the same way every where, wherever you may be

558
00:40:44,581 --> 00:40:46,671
Shri Ganesha should be worshipped

559
00:40:46,831 --> 00:40:51,075
and you will be helped out and out miraculously.

560
00:40:51,235 --> 00:40:53,359
You will be helped, miraculously

561
00:40:53,519 --> 00:40:58,730
but first do something about our chastity which is Shri Ganesha.

562
00:40:58,928 --> 00:41:00,753
May God Bless You.
