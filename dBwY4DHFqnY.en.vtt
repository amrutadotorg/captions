00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.600
22 January 1975 Talk to Sahaja Yogis Mumbai (India) Talk
Language: Marathi Talk, Bholepana ani nirvicharitecha killa

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:10.978
Yesterday, at the Bhartiya Vidya Bhavan, I spoke
to you about the 3 powers of the God Almighty.

00:00:11.078 --> 00:00:19.035
Many people who were present said that a lot of things that were told went over their heads.
[They couldn’t understand a lot of what Mother was saying.]

00:00:19.035 --> 00:00:24.458
So, it is best that I tell you only
the things that go through the heart.

00:00:24.458 --> 00:00:30.604
It is true that the brain cannot
comprehend such things.

00:00:30.604 --> 00:00:43.098
The people who claim to be big big
scientists, educated, learned etc. etc.

00:00:43.122 --> 00:00:48.581
are not able to absorb (the
knowledge) about Sahaja yoga.

00:00:48.581 --> 00:00:52.586
I have seen many such intellectuals.

00:00:52.586 --> 00:00:55.410
And one simple ordinary person

00:00:55.434 --> 00:00:57.459
the one who is not educated,

00:00:57.459 --> 00:01:05.766
who sometimes doesn't even have
means to eat, wear clothes

00:01:05.832 --> 00:01:13.159
those people easily
imbibe Sahaja yoga.

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:21.715
You cannot realise
God through education.

00:01:21.715 --> 00:01:24.241
As soon as I say this,

00:01:24.265 --> 00:01:30.691
all the education officers
would come after me!

00:01:30.691 --> 00:01:35.811
You may be able to understand how
the material world works through education.

00:01:35.877 --> 00:01:42.624
But to know the workings of the Divine

00:01:42.648 --> 00:01:47.841
you need different ways, different qualities.

00:01:47.841 --> 00:01:52.752
Out of them, the most important
one is the quality of ‘Bholepana’

00:01:52.776 --> 00:02:01.392
which translates to
‘innocence’ in English language.

00:02:01.392 --> 00:02:07.094
Small children have
innocence in them.

00:02:07.094 --> 00:02:13.867
Although you will find a few
grown-ups who are also very innocent.

00:02:13.867 --> 00:02:16.891
They get cheated,

00:02:16.915 --> 00:02:21.738
people take advantage of their innocence
and trouble them a lot.

00:02:21.738 --> 00:02:24.911
They get tortured a lot too.

00:02:24.911 --> 00:02:29.731
This is why all the saints have
suffered at the hands of people

00:02:29.731 --> 00:02:35.989
in this world, and they still do.

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:39.896
That makes me cry at times.

00:02:39.896 --> 00:02:45.065
All of you who have got
the Realization are saints.

00:02:45.065 --> 00:02:47.772
Not only saints but you have become
the members of the divine kingdom.

00:02:47.772 --> 00:02:50.437
You are now in the
same place as the deities.

00:02:50.437 --> 00:02:55.809
The same divine people.

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:59.167
These are the same deities

00:02:59.191 --> 00:03:04.017
whose description we have read about
in the Puranas [ancient Indian scriptures].

00:03:04.017 --> 00:03:07.281
These Deities have now been
awakened inside of you all.

00:03:07.324 --> 00:03:10.224
The divinity aspect is
enlightened within you.

00:03:10.264 --> 00:03:13.878
So, in such a state (of yours)

00:03:13.902 --> 00:03:18.031
it is obvious that the bhoots [evils]
will wander around you and trouble you.

00:03:18.031 --> 00:03:21.735
Let them.

00:03:21.735 --> 00:03:24.893
They can only trouble you
to a certain extent;

00:03:24.917 --> 00:03:27.908
until they reach their limits.

00:03:27.908 --> 00:03:35.449
Their powers are restricted only in
the three dimensions of this world.

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:38.781
Means only limited
to worldly matters.

00:03:38.781 --> 00:03:42.756
At the most they may
harm you physically.

00:03:42.756 --> 00:03:44.391
Let them.

00:03:44.391 --> 00:03:47.083
The human body is mortal.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:55.035
You may be harmed emotionally.
Let it be.

00:03:55.035 --> 00:03:58.860
But I have given you one fortress

00:03:58.884 --> 00:04:00.415
and shown you (Balekilla* – She refers to a fort of Shivaji where he used to take refuge to be safe from the enemy).

00:04:00.415 --> 00:04:03.343
I have shown you
that within yourselves.

00:04:03.343 --> 00:04:09.883
That is the fortress of Nirvichar
state, thoughtless awareness.

00:04:09.883 --> 00:04:18.492
Always remember that no one will dare
to step in if you establish yourself within that fort.

00:04:18.492 --> 00:04:23.563
But you must form a habit of
making yourself sit inside it.

00:04:23.563 --> 00:04:28.875
Shri Krishna is called as Ranchhod-das [the
one who runs away from the battlefield].

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:33.294
Ranchhod-das meaning
nothing else but

00:04:33.318 --> 00:04:36.777
the one escaping all the
bombardments of negativities

00:04:36.777 --> 00:04:39.153
and taking refuge in
his own fortress.

00:04:39.153 --> 00:04:41.400
That is why he is
called Ranchhod-das.

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.468
And the negativities stay
stunned and helpless outside!

00:04:45.468 --> 00:04:49.890
We are aware that there
exists a lot of black magic.

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:54.090
We know that ill minded people
are practicing all sorts of dark arts.

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:57.764
I am also aware that
they are troubling you.

00:04:57.764 --> 00:04:59.766
They torture you.

00:04:59.766 --> 00:05:02.046
But how far can
they trouble you?

00:05:02.046 --> 00:05:06.273
We will see you(negativities) once
we have entered in fortress.

00:05:06.293 --> 00:05:10.833
So, you should never
forget about this fort of yours.

00:05:10.833 --> 00:05:16.283
This circle of protection had never
been granted to humans before.

00:05:16.283 --> 00:05:18.576
It has now been made available to you
with great difficulties;

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:22.022
the door has been opened,
so go and take a place inside.

00:05:22.022 --> 00:05:23.970
Then let me see which negativity
dare to trouble you

00:05:23.994 --> 00:05:28.562
or give you any disease or health problems!

00:05:28.562 --> 00:05:31.398
You need to establish
yourself inside that fort.

00:05:31.398 --> 00:05:33.607
Even if all your family
members oppose you,

00:05:33.631 --> 00:05:38.125
you should be able to keep your state within saying
‘do what you want, I will stick to my state within’!

00:05:38.125 --> 00:05:40.633
Even if the whole society
goes against you,

00:05:40.657 --> 00:05:45.946
you should be able to
sustain yourself inside your fortress.

00:05:45.946 --> 00:05:49.849
And at last, even if the
entire world opposes you,

00:05:49.873 --> 00:05:53.486
and if you establish your foothold
inside that fort, who can enter it?

00:05:53.486 --> 00:05:59.059
And the day someone enters your fort,
he also receives his self-realization.

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:01.046
thats the mircle

00:06:01.046 --> 00:06:04.030
This miracle/magic is in our

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:06.142
hands, so pull
others inside your fort.

00:06:06.142 --> 00:06:07.442
Let them see!

00:06:07.442 --> 00:06:09.190
Then with whom they will fight,

00:06:09.214 --> 00:06:13.506
for they will understand
that we are all one.

00:06:13.506 --> 00:06:18.578
All these negative people who
are wandering around,

00:06:18.578 --> 00:06:24.017
they are digging their own graves.

00:06:24.017 --> 00:06:33.527
And this time, if they fall in their grave,
into that hell, (I) will not let them rise again.

00:06:33.527 --> 00:06:36.184
So be alert;

00:06:36.208 --> 00:06:42.952
There is no need to be scared.

00:06:42.952 --> 00:06:50.310
If you are all ready,

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:57.083
then let us create that giant fort
together from this little fortress.

00:06:57.083 --> 00:07:08.929
In this Kali Yuga; no one
has the daring to confront Me.

00:07:08.929 --> 00:07:14.078
These are murderers who are
attacking children from the back.

00:07:14.078 --> 00:07:20.473
So don’t pay attention there.

00:07:20.473 --> 00:07:25.045
Be assured that no harm can be
done to you,

00:07:25.045 --> 00:07:27.847
and never you will be harmed.

00:07:27.847 --> 00:07:33.474
but you need to stay in your
shelter (of your fort)

00:07:33.498 --> 00:07:37.013
and not to fall into their trap.

00:07:37.013 --> 00:07:42.062
Some such (negative) people are
in Dadar [an area in Mumbai, India].

00:07:42.062 --> 00:07:45.653
The black knowledge which these
false gurus have started

00:07:45.677 --> 00:07:48.964
have destroyed many homes
so far and I know about it.

00:07:48.964 --> 00:07:51.097
I had warned you already before.

00:07:51.111 --> 00:07:59.512
Only two of them have left
Dadar, but others are still out there.

00:07:59.512 --> 00:08:02.893
They are not for the welfare of people.
They only want fill their own stomach.

00:08:02.917 --> 00:08:05.518
Make money for themselves.

00:08:05.518 --> 00:08:09.990
They can surely earn
money, everyone does that.

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:16.062
But they are doing
this in the name of God.

00:08:16.062 --> 00:08:25.972
They are making money in the
name of God which is objectionable

00:08:25.972 --> 00:08:32.278
If you are selling bhoots [preaching negativity]
in the name of God

00:08:32.279 --> 00:08:36.483
then it will be hard to forgive you.

00:08:36.483 --> 00:08:41.588
God will never
forgive such people.

00:08:41.588 --> 00:08:45.949
In the early days, the
bhoots were real bhoots.

00:08:45.949 --> 00:08:52.766
But now these are people
selling bhoots in the name of God!

00:08:52.766 --> 00:08:57.667
They tie these bands and strings (supposed
to help) around the wrists of people

00:08:57.692 --> 00:09:00.032
and (they are) sending the bhoots
(through that) in your home.

00:09:00.032 --> 00:09:01.857
These kinds of businesses
are going on rampantly.

00:09:01.857 --> 00:09:03.977
These sorts of businesses are
going on in our London on such a scale

00:09:03.977 --> 00:09:07.577
that I was wondering whether this is
London or Bhoot-nagari (the city of bhoots)!

00:09:07.577 --> 00:09:11.951
As soon as you touch the grounds of
London, the bhoots are swarming everywhere!

00:09:11.951 --> 00:09:15.055
Wherever you see,
it is just devil worship.(audio not clear)

00:09:15.055 --> 00:09:21.027
That Christ who had warned
against following the path of such bhoots.

00:09:21.027 --> 00:09:24.719
Warned against doing such work for devils

00:09:24.743 --> 00:09:29.656
those same Christians, are now scavenging
the graveyards for blood and ashes

00:09:29.656 --> 00:09:31.337
and are practicing these dark arts.

00:09:31.337 --> 00:09:37.210
They are doing planchettes!

00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:41.137
Means they are doing
exactly what was forbidden.

00:09:41.137 --> 00:09:46.964
Christ had spoken about it
and so had Nanak Saheb.

00:09:46.964 --> 00:09:52.792
No one else had spoken about it
so avowedly about this devil worship.

00:09:52.792 --> 00:09:58.098
And now all these Christians – who used to
rule over India as British –

00:09:58.098 --> 00:10:01.401
have now been
possessed by these people.

00:10:01.401 --> 00:10:06.239
The streets and alleys of London are rampant
with businesses producing these bhoots.

00:10:06.239 --> 00:10:10.643
And now what has
happened to their wisdom!

00:10:10.643 --> 00:10:21.187
When I speak out against
them, the people don’t accept it.

00:10:21.187 --> 00:10:24.178
The only difference is

00:10:24.202 --> 00:10:26.159
the people out here in India sell it
under the name of God

00:10:26.159 --> 00:10:27.504
while people there sell it in the name of bhoots:

00:10:27.528 --> 00:10:31.042
they call it as Satan craft, or they call it witchcraft, etc.

00:10:31.042 --> 00:10:33.299
There is no falsehood
there like we have in India.

00:10:33.299 --> 00:10:36.569
But this is ‘exported’ there from India.

00:10:36.569 --> 00:10:38.771
Many are exported there!

00:10:38.771 --> 00:10:42.686
From here(India) those kings of
bhoots(False gurus) went there

00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:48.014
have earned so much money, that each
one has 35-35 Rolls Royces [luxury cars].

00:10:48.014 --> 00:10:56.823
One Rolls Royce costs around 8,00,000
sorry 10,00,000 Rs (in 1975).

00:10:56.823 --> 00:10:59.792
This is what has started now in England.

00:10:59.792 --> 00:11:03.796
And it is no better in India.

00:11:03.796 --> 00:11:08.234
You need to first decide whether
you want Dharma or adharma?

00:11:08.234 --> 00:11:13.139
If you want Dharma, then
you have to stand on truth.

00:11:13.139 --> 00:11:17.210
For those who are looking
for untruth, I don’t have it.

00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:19.167
I don’t have chamatkars [magic tricks],

00:11:19.191 --> 00:11:23.711
I won’t pull out a ring to give you if you
want those sorts of things.

00:11:23.711 --> 00:11:28.621
I have meditation.

00:11:28.621 --> 00:11:48.141
I want to teach you the art of unlocking this great treasure, this great potential power which God has placed within you.

00:11:48.141 --> 00:11:54.276
I want to ask all these (false gurus) who are
doing such gimmicks like giving out rings,

00:11:54.276 --> 00:11:56.070
“They should solve all
the problems of India!

00:11:56.070 --> 00:11:58.818
They should be
made Prime minister.

00:11:58.818 --> 00:12:00.653
They will give the
rings to everyone!

00:12:00.653 --> 00:12:03.293
Why (false gurus) giving rings
only to rich peoples?

00:12:03.293 --> 00:12:06.359
Distribute here, there are
lots of poor people here.

00:12:06.359 --> 00:12:09.271
They do not pay
attention to the poor at all.

00:12:09.271 --> 00:12:19.439
All their attention is on the pockets of the rich
and the rich are stupidly just going there(to such people).

00:12:19.439 --> 00:12:21.213
This is what is happening now.

00:12:21.213 --> 00:12:31.751
You are not aware that the reason this country is in this pathetic state today is because of these bhoots.

00:12:31.751 --> 00:12:37.707
So never help such people for
even a slight gain

00:12:37.707 --> 00:12:40.233
and don't stand at
their door.

00:12:40.233 --> 00:12:43.313
If anyone speaks about
bhoots, do not stand at their doorstep.

00:12:43.313 --> 00:12:46.432
Everything is in Dharma.

00:12:46.433 --> 00:12:51.540
All the things in this world including wealth and even much
beyond in this world, all of them are encompassed by the Dharma.

00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:53.373
Everything is within Dharma.

00:12:53.373 --> 00:12:56.242
And beyond that is also only in Dharma.

00:12:56.363 --> 00:12:59.310
Everything has been
created by Dharma only.

00:12:59.310 --> 00:13:02.589
There is nothing that
exists beyond Dharma.

00:13:02.589 --> 00:13:07.120
And what lies beyond that
is not worth telling you

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:10.611
There are seven
generations of hell.

00:13:10.635 --> 00:13:13.893
If you want to suffer from that

00:13:13.893 --> 00:13:17.451
or if you want to get out of the cycle of human
birth and step into the birth cycle of insects,

00:13:17.475 --> 00:13:27.440
only then you may walk on
the path (of this bhoot vidya).

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:34.180
You must speak
openly about it.

00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:38.275
Stop all these magic games.

00:13:38.301 --> 00:13:43.489
There's no need to argue about it
(And you shouldn’t be scared to do that).

00:13:43.529 --> 00:13:47.290
The real magic within should
manifest,

00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:49.962
the light should shine within.

00:13:49.962 --> 00:13:54.150
And the flowers blooming
in that joy should

00:13:54.174 --> 00:13:56.036
spread their fragrance everywhere

00:13:56.036 --> 00:14:03.976
so that this mud of dirt gets
transformed into a lake of lotuses.

00:14:03.976 --> 00:14:08.875
That time has come.

00:14:08.875 --> 00:14:13.186
The entire universe
is ready for that time.

00:14:13.186 --> 00:14:16.322
The five elements are
awaiting to help you out.

00:14:16.322 --> 00:14:25.064
All the great incarnations are showering
blessings upon you to carry out this great task.

00:14:25.064 --> 00:14:36.142
Everyone is fully prepared to
help you out in every possible way.

00:14:36.142 --> 00:14:39.555
It is now up to the
humans to make a decision.

00:14:39.555 --> 00:14:43.331
They must choose whether we
are following Dharma or Adharma.

00:14:43.404 --> 00:14:48.020
Are we supporting
Dharma or Adharma?”

00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:54.227
It is not possible
to buy the Dharma with money.

00:14:54.227 --> 00:14:59.932
Those who have made a
business out of God,

00:14:59.932 --> 00:15:04.637
Those who have made a
mockery of Dharma by

00:15:04.637 --> 00:15:07.431
fooling and cheating the innocent,

00:15:07.455 --> 00:15:09.909
all those who have created this
tragic irony of Dharma

00:15:09.909 --> 00:15:15.014
all of them will
have to suffer for their sins.

00:15:15.014 --> 00:15:21.087
But the biggest sin of
all is to torture the saints.

00:15:21.087 --> 00:15:29.429
There is no greater sin than distracting
the seekers from their path to seek God.

00:15:29.429 --> 00:15:34.165
And the punishment for that sin is
so horrific that it cannot be described.

00:15:34.195 --> 00:15:41.040
So never ever should
anyone take to such evil work.

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:44.265
The way Dharma is so beautiful,

00:15:44.289 --> 00:15:46.534
as guiding as it is,

00:15:46.558 --> 00:15:50.586
Dharma is as loving as it
as, as affectionate as it is,

00:15:50.610 --> 00:15:58.508
as well as integrating everyone
together, same way it is refulgent too.

00:15:58.508 --> 00:16:02.261
It is so radiant that it can also be destructive
which can burn and annihilate everything .

00:16:02.261 --> 00:16:04.621
Dharma has got the
same powers as Agni [fire].

00:16:04.621 --> 00:16:09.669
You better keep this in mind.

00:16:09.669 --> 00:16:17.210
This time, I am noticing even more such
things in Dadar (area in Mumbai).

00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:27.408
What kind of diseases
and what kind of troubles ,

00:16:27.432 --> 00:16:32.613
today we are giving to our own
mothers , sisters and children ;

00:16:32.637 --> 00:16:36.395
It is only we ourself are troubling our
own people; no one else.

00:16:36.395 --> 00:16:38.698
Animals do not trouble humans.

00:16:38.698 --> 00:16:41.770
The humans are harming
their fellow human beings.

00:16:41.821 --> 00:16:44.823
They are the ones slitting
each other’s throats,

00:16:44.847 --> 00:16:47.673
no one else is coming and slitting.

00:16:47.673 --> 00:16:50.710
And the reason this is happening is because the
rakshasas [demons] have entered into the humans.

00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:53.679
And at same time a bhakta
(devotee) also resides in the human.

00:16:53.679 --> 00:16:57.738
The demons job is only
to slit the devotee’s throat.

00:16:57.738 --> 00:17:01.888
If they don’t do it, they
wouldn’t be rakshasas!

00:17:01.888 --> 00:17:04.612
But the situation is worse

00:17:04.636 --> 00:17:06.802
as the rakshasas have entered
into each of the saints as well.

00:17:06.826 --> 00:17:11.197
Now What can I do?

00:17:11.197 --> 00:17:13.605
The one whom I consider as my son

00:17:13.629 --> 00:17:15.189
the rakshasa has also entered inside him.

00:17:15.213 --> 00:17:17.709
Now what am I to do ?

00:17:17.709 --> 00:17:22.690
I can’t slap this child,
neither can I embrace him.

00:17:22.715 --> 00:17:26.479
What a helpless situation for a Mother!

00:17:26.504 --> 00:17:28.552
The Mother has come to visit the child,

00:17:28.576 --> 00:17:31.880
but the child is hosting a bhoot in his head.

00:17:31.889 --> 00:17:34.462
Now what can I do?

00:17:34.462 --> 00:17:37.890
Throw away all those rakshasas
who are sitting on your heads!

00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:40.336
Why are you carrying
them with all that pride?

00:17:40.336 --> 00:17:44.697
What good have
they ever done to you?

00:17:44.697 --> 00:17:49.131
There is scarcity of
food, scarcity of water….

00:17:49.155 --> 00:17:51.058
the mother earth is
helpless in front of you,

00:17:51.082 --> 00:17:53.639
the sun is also frustrated and

00:17:53.639 --> 00:18:04.317
the sea has thrown his hands in the air
because of this stupidity of humans.

00:18:04.317 --> 00:18:08.685
The people troubling the saints
should keep this in their minds

00:18:08.709 --> 00:18:12.546
if you trouble a saint
for a few pennies,

00:18:12.570 --> 00:18:20.382
you will be answerable for it, not only in
this lifetime, but many births after this.

00:18:20.382 --> 00:18:25.059
I know that there are 2-4 persons who
have settled in this society (In general)

00:18:25.083 --> 00:18:28.674
after making money in the wrong way.

00:18:28.674 --> 00:18:33.980
Know that they are here to trouble.
keep this in mind !

00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:39.852
Know that I am the mother of those
rakshasas as well, as I am yours.

00:18:39.852 --> 00:18:43.944
But to protect you,

00:18:43.968 --> 00:18:49.261
I have killed them many times and
will be killing them. So do not worry.

00:18:49.261 --> 00:18:52.164
Even if they are my
children, I will still kill them.

00:18:52.164 --> 00:18:53.599
Let them see.

00:18:53.599 --> 00:18:56.402
Hopefully some of them will ascend
and become humans, then we will see.

00:18:56.402 --> 00:19:02.642
But don’t you fall for their
games and illusions.

00:19:02.642 --> 00:19:07.768
We cannot fill our stomachs with lies .

00:19:07.792 --> 00:19:13.233
As it is, the nation is in ruins

00:19:13.257 --> 00:19:17.356
but don’t ruin the future
of coming generations.

00:19:17.356 --> 00:19:20.926
Great souls are taking
births in these times.

00:19:20.926 --> 00:19:22.819
Do not create hell for them

00:19:22.843 --> 00:19:25.013
but make some special
arrangements for them,

00:19:25.013 --> 00:19:27.540
create something beautiful
to welcome them on this earth.

00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:31.637
What have you done
here for your children?

00:19:31.637 --> 00:19:33.982
I am standing here.

00:19:33.982 --> 00:19:37.543
Ask for anything
and I will give you.

00:19:37.543 --> 00:19:42.982
But from where
can I bring wisdom?

00:19:42.982 --> 00:19:45.848
From where can we
borrow the wisdom for you?

00:19:45.918 --> 00:19:51.257
You have to get
your own wisdom.

00:19:51.257 --> 00:19:54.114
It is the only thing I am
asking you to get,

00:19:54.138 --> 00:19:56.620
I am ready to do the
rest of the hard work.

00:19:56.644 --> 00:20:00.285
That seed (of wisdom) lies within you.

00:20:00.285 --> 00:20:08.908
It is absolutely true that
the seed lies inside you.

00:20:08.908 --> 00:20:15.548
‘Vaalya’ (He was fishermen) transformed into
‘Vaalmiki’(Sage who wrote Ramayana).

00:20:15.705 --> 00:20:20.986
The (power) thing by which he
got transformed, is also within you.

00:20:20.986 --> 00:20:26.125
He didn’t necessarily want
to become Vaalmiki,

00:20:26.125 --> 00:20:28.233
nor did he have
that much wisdom.

00:20:28.233 --> 00:20:34.355
The day he realized that he is killing his
soul through his acts for little money,

00:20:34.355 --> 00:20:38.471
he decided that day only.

00:20:38.472 --> 00:20:42.371
The same day he decided.

00:20:42.371 --> 00:20:46.639
He thought, “I have done alot of this.

00:20:46.663 --> 00:20:49.115
For whom I am doing this?"

00:20:49.115 --> 00:20:54.425
What have I done for myself?”

00:20:54.425 --> 00:20:59.805
Think this way once and see
what have I done for myself?

00:20:59.805 --> 00:21:02.182
I yearn for you

00:21:02.206 --> 00:21:14.607
and my soul yearns for
you every moment..( I am concerned ).

00:21:14.607 --> 00:21:19.848
I want to light the lamp inside you

00:21:19.848 --> 00:21:26.385
the light which will spread all
over the world.

00:21:26.385 --> 00:21:29.089
that light is going to enlighten from India only

00:21:29.089 --> 00:21:31.903
you will be surprised, dont be scared.

00:21:31.903 --> 00:21:34.627
Its a matter of few days.

00:21:34.627 --> 00:21:37.547
It is only a matter of time.
Let this time pass.

00:21:37.547 --> 00:21:41.734
Through these vibrations(your country)
you are going to sit on the top one day,

00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:47.780
bear this in mind .

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:55.781
And there is only
one reason for that.

00:21:55.781 --> 00:22:00.946
We agree everything is messed
up in this country

00:22:00.946 --> 00:22:02.922
but still there is one reason

00:22:02.922 --> 00:22:08.382
We haven’t learnt to
disrespect our mothers,

00:22:08.406 --> 00:22:11.486
we still repect our Mothers honour.

00:22:11.486 --> 00:22:14.121
And until this respect is there

00:22:14.145 --> 00:22:20.206
the position of this country [in the
Kingdom of God] is not going to ever change.

00:22:20.298 --> 00:22:25.034
This is Bhog Bhumi – land of experience
or this is Yoga Bhumi – land of Yoga.

00:22:25.058 --> 00:22:30.950
You are not to decide on this.
It has already been decided by the Gods.

00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:38.054
And why do the people born in this country consider
themselves inferior only because of scarcity of food?

00:22:38.054 --> 00:22:43.896
Only you people can live like
this, not the people in London.

00:22:43.896 --> 00:22:49.890
They start crying even for something as small
as the collar of the shirt being long or short.

00:22:49.914 --> 00:22:54.328
You are the true Sanyasis

00:22:54.352 --> 00:22:59.344
as you can sleep anywhere, can eat
whatever and stay anywhere means what?

00:22:59.353 --> 00:23:06.018
You have the blessings of your Mother.

00:23:06.018 --> 00:23:11.323
So, if you want to disrespect your Mother,
go ahead and do it

00:23:11.323 --> 00:23:19.298
and then be ready for
the consequences!

00:23:19.298 --> 00:23:28.707
At times one can be upset
with Mother  it's ok.

00:23:28.707 --> 00:23:38.080
but it is also a fact that the highest
relationship in humans is the one with Mother

00:23:38.104 --> 00:23:43.837
and that one can see(get Darshan)
God almighty in Her only.

00:23:43.837 --> 00:23:49.174
And only the Mother of this country
have this capacity to bear so much.

00:23:49.174 --> 00:23:58.404
Other places, they ask the children to
leave the house at a very young age.

00:23:58.404 --> 00:24:02.729
And if the children do
not help in the chores,

00:24:02.753 --> 00:24:07.680
they are asked to pay for their food,
such are the mothers outside (India).

00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:09.670
Even if child die is also ok,

00:24:09.694 --> 00:24:11.605
but Mother don't want
to spend money on child

00:24:11.629 --> 00:24:17.523
90 year old women want to
keep money for lipstick.

00:24:17.523 --> 00:24:21.860
And see how you
honored your Mothers.

00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:29.693
Only here such mothers take birth; nowhere in
the world you would find a mother like in India.

00:24:29.693 --> 00:24:36.901
You can go round and see that-
But you have tortured her so much.

00:24:36.901 --> 00:24:41.410
Dharma will be lost in this
case. Do not disrespect dharma.

00:24:41.410 --> 00:24:46.452
Stop all or any plans of
humiliating your Mother.

00:24:46.452 --> 00:24:49.715
Return the money.

00:24:49.715 --> 00:24:52.891
I know everything.

00:24:52.891 --> 00:25:04.303
Don’t think that
I don’t know you!

00:25:04.303 --> 00:25:07.168
[Shri Mataji turns soft again.] ok.

00:25:07.168 --> 00:25:19.952
Anyways, whatever it is, right now – in this
lifetime, now..you need to get your realization.

00:25:19.952 --> 00:25:25.391
Let’s eat the laadoos [sweets]
first and then we will see (sort out the rest).

00:25:25.391 --> 00:25:29.795
What else can make
the Mother happy?

00:25:29.795 --> 00:25:35.234
Mother has prepared such nice food for you
all and then she has to scold child!What is this?

00:25:35.234 --> 00:25:38.087
But I have to do it(sometimes).

00:25:38.087 --> 00:25:42.174
So now relax and
sit down to eat.

00:25:42.174 --> 00:25:48.147
Eat your food in a relaxed mood.

00:25:48.147 --> 00:25:55.054
And take the amrut
[nectar], acquire the amrut.

00:25:55.054 --> 00:25:58.953
Let this amrut in the form of love,
flow through you into the entire world.

00:25:58.953 --> 00:26:02.297
Here we are set on changing
the course of this world

00:26:02.321 --> 00:26:06.942
– and you are still involved
with these petty nuisances.

00:26:06.942 --> 00:26:09.590
All these things are going to be recorded
in the history of this world

00:26:09.614 --> 00:26:13.105
keep that in mind, all the people
who have committed such stupidities.

00:26:13.105 --> 00:26:20.345
Each name will be remembered,
and people will spit upon them.

00:26:20.345 --> 00:26:23.888
Not only their children but generations
will be blamed for those wrongdoings.

00:26:23.912 --> 00:26:29.334
So, these were the dirty people
who did these dirty deeds!!!

00:26:29.334 --> 00:26:33.759
Brighten up your work!

00:26:33.759 --> 00:26:48.407
Enlighten yourself. That is what the
Mother wants to give to her children.

00:26:48.407 --> 00:26:53.254
Go into meditation
– close your eyes.

00:26:53.254 --> 00:26:55.667
[Shri Mataji is
speaking in Hindi]

00:26:55.667 --> 00:26:58.839
The talk I had to give today,

00:26:58.863 --> 00:27:02.354
it had to be in Marathi,without
Marathi you cannot get the same fun,

00:27:02.354 --> 00:27:06.492
This Heroic languange I can’t manage in Hindi.

00:27:06.492 --> 00:27:09.461
I can manage
only in Marathi!

00:27:09.461 --> 00:27:13.527
So, forgive me if I
didn’t speak in Hindi.

00:27:13.527 --> 00:27:23.729
Forgive me again as I had to tell some things to
some specific people it was not meant for you.

00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:25.123
[Shri Mataji again speaking in Marathi]

00:27:25.183 --> 00:27:31.416
[referring to some guru.] Don’t say names.
At least, for the time being, do not blame.

00:27:31.416 --> 00:27:33.852
Many people are lost.

00:27:33.852 --> 00:27:36.522
People have gone to many
different (so called) gurus.

00:27:36.522 --> 00:27:39.682
What is a guru, who is a Guru, who is
not; who is Guru,

00:27:39.706 --> 00:27:43.095
who is animal – how to
recognize it – one feels it inside.

00:27:43.095 --> 00:27:47.281
How to recognise it? It
has some feeling within.

00:27:47.281 --> 00:27:51.192
How to recognize it? That you can
understand through vibrations.

00:27:51.192 --> 00:27:55.525
The vibrations flowing from your hand can
tell you who the real guru is and who is not.

00:27:55.549 --> 00:27:57.777
So first learn how to get that awareness
and then accept Guru.

00:27:57.801 --> 00:28:00.170
Why are you making anyone Guru before like
mad men? First get the eyes to see the real Guru.

00:28:00.195 --> 00:28:02.529
Until then keep
all the gurus aside.

00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:05.247
After doing Namaskar keep all of them away.

00:28:05.247 --> 00:28:10.487
For now, you are your own
guru, and I am your Mother.
