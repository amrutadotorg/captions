00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.008
Yesterday, at the Bhartiya Vidya Bhavan, I spoke to you about the 3 powers of the God Almighty.

00:00:10.008 --> 00:00:15.737
Many people who were present said that a lot of things that were told went over their heads. [They couldn’t understand a lot of what Mother was saying.]

00:00:15.737 --> 00:00:22.611
So, it is best that I tell you only the things that go through the heart.

00:00:22.611 --> 00:00:28.009
It is true that the brain cannot comprehend such things.

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:46.823
The people who claim to be scientists, educated, learned are not able to absorb (the knowledge) about Sahaja yoga

00:00:46.823 --> 00:00:52.535
I have seen many such cases.

00:00:52.535 --> 00:01:10.118
And then there are everyday average people – the ones who are not educated, who sometimes don’t even have means to eat, wear clothes – those people easily imbibe Sahaja yoga.

00:01:10.118 --> 00:01:18.699
You cannot realise God through education.

00:01:18.699 --> 00:01:27.492
Although if I say this, all the big shots in the education industry would come after me!

00:01:27.492 --> 00:01:36.041
You may be able to understand how the material world works through education.

00:01:36.041 --> 00:01:47.010
But to grasp the workings of the Divine you need different ways, different qualities.

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:56.784
Out of them, the most important one is the quality of ‘Bholepana’ – which translates to ‘innocence’ in English.

00:01:56.784 --> 00:02:06.381
Small children have innocence in them.

00:02:06.381 --> 00:02:11.438
Although you will find a few grown-ups who are also very innocent.

00:02:11.438 --> 00:02:20.229
They get cheated, people take advantage of their innocence and trouble them a lot.

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:23.720
They get tortured a lot too.

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:35.328
This is why all the saints have suffered at the hands of people in this world, and they still do.

00:02:35.328 --> 00:02:38.528
That makes me feel sad at times.

00:02:38.528 --> 00:02:45.173
All of you who have got the Realization are saints.

00:02:45.173 --> 00:02:50.521
Not only saints but you have become the members of the divine kingdom.

00:02:50.521 --> 00:02:59.459
You are now in the same place as the gods. The same godly people.

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:04.586
These are the same gods whose description we have read about in the Puranas [ancient Indian scriptures].

00:03:04.586 --> 00:03:07.838
These Gods have now been awakened inside of you all.

00:03:07.838 --> 00:03:11.019
The divinity aspect is enlightened within you.

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:19.722
So, in such a state (of yours) it is obvious that the bhoots [evils] will wander around you and trouble you. Let them.

00:03:19.722 --> 00:03:27.583
They can only trouble you to a certain extent; until they reach their limits.

00:03:27.583 --> 00:03:33.574
Their powers are restricted only in the three dimensions of this world.

00:03:33.574 --> 00:03:39.096
Means only limited to worldly matters.

00:03:39.096 --> 00:03:44.415
At the most they may harm you physically. Let them.

00:03:44.415 --> 00:03:46.668
The human body is mortal.

00:03:46.668 --> 00:03:50.032
You may be harmed emotionally. Let it be.

00:03:50.032 --> 00:04:00.335
But I have offered you and shown you a fort (Balekilla* – She refers to a fort of Shivaji where he used to take refuge to be safe from the enemy).

00:04:00.335 --> 00:04:02.838
I have shown you this inside yourselves.

00:04:02.838 --> 00:04:08.820
That is the fort of Nirvichar state, thoughtless awareness.

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:16.239
Always remember that no one will dare to step in if you establish yourself inside that fort.

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:22.042
But you must form a habit of making yourself sit inside it.

00:04:22.042 --> 00:04:27.376
Shri Krishna is called as Ranchhod-das [the one who runs away from the battlefield].

00:04:27.376 --> 00:04:41.422
Ranchhod-das meaning nothing else but the one escaping all the bombardments of negativities and taking refuge in his own fort. That is why he is called Ranchhod-das.

00:04:41.422 --> 00:04:45.120
And the negativities stay stunned and helpless outside!

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.568
We are aware that there exists a lot of black magic.

00:04:49.568 --> 00:04:54.224
We know that ill minded people are practicing all sorts of dark arts.

00:04:54.224 --> 00:04:57.049
I am also aware that they are troubling you.

00:04:57.049 --> 00:04:59.335
They tortureyou.

00:04:59.335 --> 00:05:02.250
But how far can they trouble you?

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:09.533
You should be able to challenge all those negativities to come and try attacking you in that fort of yours (of thoughtless awareness). So, you should never forget about this fort of yours.

00:05:09.533 --> 00:05:16.031
This circle of protection had never been granted to humans before.

00:05:16.031 --> 00:05:21.550
It has now been made available to you with great difficulties; the door has been opened, so go and take a place inside.

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:26.620
Then let me see which negativity has the nerve to trouble you or give you any disease or health problems!

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:31.440
You need to establish yourself inside that fort.

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:38.660
Even if all your family members oppose you, you should be able to keep your state within saying ‘do what you want, I will stick to my state within’!

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:43.240
Even if the whole society goes against you, you should be able to sustain yourself inside your fort.

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:54.552
And at last, even if the entire world opposes you, and if you establish your foothold inside that fort, who can enter it?

00:05:54.552 --> 00:05:58.858
And the day someone enters your fort, he also receives his self-realization.

00:05:58.858 --> 00:06:06.233
This miracle/magic is in our hands, so pull others inside your fort.

00:06:06.233 --> 00:06:12.407
Let them see! Then with whom they will fight, for they will understand that we are all one.

00:06:12.407 --> 00:06:22.629
All these negative people who are wandering around, they are digging their own graves.

00:06:22.629 --> 00:06:29.190
And this time, if they fall in their grave, into that hell, (I) will not let them rise again.

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:39.229
So be alert; there is no need to be scared.

00:06:39.229 --> 00:06:55.680
If you are all prepared, let us create that giant fortress together.

00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:06.674
In this Kali Yuga; no one has the daring to confront Me.

00:07:06.674 --> 00:07:16.580
These are murderers who are attacking children from the back. So don’t pay attention there.

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:29.254
Be assured that no harm can ever be done to you, and you will always remain safe

00:07:29.254 --> 00:07:36.508
– but you need to stay in your shelter (of your fort) and not to fall into their trap.

00:07:36.508 --> 00:07:40.739
Some such (negative) people are in Dadar [an area in Mumbai, India].

00:07:40.739 --> 00:07:51.485
The black/dark art which these false gurus are spreading, have destroyed many homes so far and I know about it. I had warned you already before.

00:07:51.485 --> 00:07:56.529
Only two of them have left Dadar, but others are still out there.

00:07:56.529 --> 00:08:04.627
They are not for the welfare of people but to make money for themselves.

00:08:04.627 --> 00:08:08.697
They can surely earn money, everyone does that.

00:08:08.697 --> 00:08:12.504
But they are doing this in the name of God.

00:08:12.504 --> 00:08:36.176
There can be pardon for making money in the name of God, But it is unpardonable when they are spreading bhoots [preaching negativity] in the name of God.

00:08:36.176 --> 00:08:40.440
God will never forgive such people.

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:45.236
In the early days, the bhoots were real bhoots.

00:08:45.236 --> 00:08:50.106
But now these are people selling bhoots in the name of God!

00:08:50.106 --> 00:08:59.915
They put these bands and strings (supposed to help) around the wrists of people and send the bhoots through those in their houses.

00:08:59.915 --> 00:09:07.958
These kinds of businesses are going on rampantly. I was amazed to see these sorts of businesses going on in London on such a scale and I was wondering  whether this is London or Bhoot-nagari: the city of bhoots!

00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:11.665
As soon as you touch the grounds of London, the bhoots are swarming everywhere!

00:09:11.665 --> 00:09:15.123
Wherever you see, it is just devil worship.

00:09:15.123 --> 00:09:20.721
They are everywhere where Christ had warned against following the path of such bhoots.

00:09:20.721 --> 00:09:24.612
Warned against doing such work for devils,

00:09:24.612 --> 00:09:35.623
– those same Christians, are now scavenging the graveyards for blood and ashes and are practicing these dark arts. They are doing planchettes!

00:09:35.623 --> 00:09:41.069
Means they are doing exactly what was forbidden.

00:09:41.069 --> 00:09:46.882
Christ had spoken about it and so had Nanak Saheb.

00:09:46.882 --> 00:10:00.526
No one else had spoken about it so avowedly about this devil worship. And now all these Christians – who used to rule over India as British – have now been possessed by these people.

00:10:00.526 --> 00:10:05.367
The streets and alleys of London are rampant with businesses producing these bhoots.

00:10:05.367 --> 00:10:09.769
And now what has happened to their wisdom!

00:10:09.769 --> 00:10:16.565
When I speak out against them, the people don’t accept it.

00:10:16.565 --> 00:10:31.217
The only difference is the people out here in India sell it under the name of God while people out there sell it as it is: they call it the art of Satan, or they call it witchcraft, etc.

00:10:31.217 --> 00:10:36.264
There is no falsehood there like we have in India. But those arts have been ‘exported’ there from India.

00:10:36.264 --> 00:10:38.698
Many are exported there!

00:10:38.698 --> 00:10:47.776
All those big false gurus who went there from India have now become so rich, that each one has 35 odd Rolls Royces [luxury cars].

00:10:47.776 --> 00:10:55.620
One Rolls Royce costs around 10,000,000 Rs (in 1975).

00:10:55.620 --> 00:11:02.701
This is what the situation is in England. And it is no better in India.

00:11:02.701 --> 00:11:08.057
You need to first decide if you want Dharma or adharma?

00:11:08.057 --> 00:11:12.686
If you want Dharma, then you need to stand on truth.

00:11:12.686 --> 00:11:17.051
For those who are looking for untruth, I don’t have it.

00:11:17.051 --> 00:11:26.809
I don’t have chamatkars [magic tricks], I won’t pull out a ring to give you if you want those sorts of things. I have meditation.

00:11:26.809 --> 00:11:45.621
I want to teach you the art of unlocking this great treasure, this great potential power placed inside of you by the Divine.

00:11:45.621 --> 00:11:58.197
I want to ask all these false gurus who are doing such gimmicks like giving out rings, “They should solve all the problems of India! They should be made Prime minister.

00:11:58.197 --> 00:12:02.807
They will give the rings to everyone!  Why do they entertain only the rich?

00:12:02.807 --> 00:12:08.896
Distribute to the needy, there are lots of poor people. They do not pay attention to the poor at all.

00:12:08.896 --> 00:12:21.961
All their attention is on the pockets of the rich and the rich are stupid enough to go to such people. Such is the state of affairs.

00:12:21.961 --> 00:12:27.762
You are not aware of the fact that these bhoots are the cause of such a miserable state of this country.

00:12:27.762 --> 00:12:39.854
So never help such people for even a slight gain or never stand at their doorstep to seek any help.

00:12:39.854 --> 00:12:43.704
If anyone speaks about bhoots, please do not go to them.

00:12:43.704 --> 00:12:46.097
Everything is in Dharma.

00:12:46.097 --> 00:12:53.712
All the things in this world including wealth and even much beyond, all of them are encompassed by the Dharma. Everything is Dharma.

00:12:53.712 --> 00:12:56.596
All of it is created by Dharma alone. There is nothing that exists beyond Dharma.

00:12:56.596 --> 00:13:06.876
And that what exists beyond cannot be described to you.

00:13:06.876 --> 00:13:19.636
If you want to suffer for 7 generations in hell or if you want to get out of the cycle of human birth and step into the birth cycle of insects, only then you may walk on the path of this bhoot vidya.

00:13:19.636 --> 00:13:32.186
You must speak openly about it.

00:13:32.186 --> 00:13:37.670
That all these games of magic should be brought to a stop.

00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:41.561
All these false magical gimmicks should be stopped. And you shouldn’t be scared to do that.

00:13:41.561 --> 00:13:49.656
The real magic within should manifest, the light within should shine.

00:13:49.656 --> 00:14:06.715
And the flowers blooming in that joy should spread their perfume everywhere so that this mud of dirt gets transformed into a lake of lotuses. That time has come.

00:14:06.715 --> 00:14:12.970
The entire universe is ready for that time.

00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:16.382
The five elements are awaiting to help you out.

00:14:16.382 --> 00:14:24.725
All the great incarnations are showering blessings upon you to carry out this great task.

00:14:24.725 --> 00:14:35.822
Everyone is fully prepared to help you out in every possible way.

00:14:35.822 --> 00:14:43.107
It is now up to the humans to make a decision. They must choose whether we are following Dharma or Adharma.

00:14:43.107 --> 00:14:46.132
Are we supporting Dharma or Adharma?”

00:14:46.132 --> 00:14:50.740
It is not possible to buy the Dharma.

00:14:50.740 --> 00:15:12.008
Those who have made a business out of God, those who have made a mockery of Dharma by fooling and cheating the innocent, all those who have created this tragic irony of Dharma, all of them will have to suffer for their sins.

00:15:12.008 --> 00:15:20.857
But the biggest sin of all is to torture the saints.

00:15:20.857 --> 00:15:28.565
There is no greater sin than distracting the seekers from their path to seek God.

00:15:28.565 --> 00:15:33.416
And the punishment for that sin is so horrific that it cannot be described.

00:15:33.416 --> 00:15:39.206
So never ever should anyone take to such evil work.

00:15:39.206 --> 00:15:58.176
The way Dharma is beautiful, guiding, loving, encompassing as well as integrating everyone together, same way it is refulgent too.

00:15:58.176 --> 00:16:02.541
It is so radiant that it can also be destructive which can burn and annihilate everything .

00:16:02.541 --> 00:16:05.751
Dharma has got the same powers as  Agni [fire]. You better keep this in mind.

00:16:05.751 --> 00:16:15.472
This time, I am noticing even more such things in Dadar (area in Mumbai).

00:16:15.472 --> 00:16:32.583
What kind of diseases and  what kind of troubles , today we are giving to our own mothers , sisters and children ;

00:16:32.583 --> 00:16:36.393
It is only us troubling our own people; no one else.

00:16:36.393 --> 00:16:40.974
Animals do not trouble humans. The humans are harming their fellow human beings.

00:16:40.974 --> 00:16:46.529
They are the ones slitting each other’s throats, no one else.

00:16:46.529 --> 00:16:53.614
And the reason this is happening is because the rakshasas [demons] have entered into the humans. And at same time a bhakta (devotee) also resides in the human.

00:16:53.614 --> 00:16:57.805
The demons only wish to slit the devotee’s throat.

00:16:57.805 --> 00:17:00.296
If they don’t do it, they wouldn’t be rakshasas!

00:17:00.296 --> 00:17:09.171
But the situation is worse as the rakshasas have entered into each of the  saints as well.Now What can I do?

00:17:09.171 --> 00:17:17.110
The one who I have made my son – the rakshasa also entered inside.Now what can I do ?

00:17:17.110 --> 00:17:26.313
I can’t slap this child, neither can I embrace him. What a helpless situation for a Mother!

00:17:26.313 --> 00:17:33.888
The Mother has come to visit the child, but the child is hosting a bhoot in his head. Now what can I do?

00:17:33.888 --> 00:17:38.183
Throw away all those rakshasas who are sitting on your heads!

00:17:38.183 --> 00:17:43.009
Why are you carrying them with all that pride? What good have they ever done to you?

00:17:43.009 --> 00:17:54.060
There is scarcity of food, scarcity of water…. the mother earth is helpless in front of you, the sun is also frustrated

00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:59.154
and the sea has thrown his hands in the air because of this stupidity of humans.

00:17:59.154 --> 00:18:17.174
The people troubling the saints should keep this in their minds – if you trouble a saint for a few pennies, you will be answerable for it, not only in this lifetime, but many births after this.

00:18:17.174 --> 00:18:27.478
I know that there are few people who have settled in this society (In general) who are making money in the wrong way.

00:18:27.478 --> 00:18:37.945
Know that they are here to trouble.keep this in mind ! Know that I am the mother of those rakshasas as well, as I am yours.

00:18:37.945 --> 00:18:48.291
But to protect you, I have killed them many times and will be killing them. So do not worry.

00:18:48.291 --> 00:18:52.689
Even if they are my children, I will still kill them. Let them see.

00:18:52.689 --> 00:19:03.534
Hopefully some of them will ascend and become humans, then we will see. But don’t you fall for their games and illusions.

00:19:03.534 --> 00:19:06.947
We cannot fill our stomachs with lies.

00:19:06.947 --> 00:19:17.482
As it is, the nation is in ruins – but don’t ruin the future of coming generations.

00:19:17.482 --> 00:19:20.992
Great souls are taking births in these times.

00:19:20.992 --> 00:19:29.790
Do not create hell for them but make some special arrangements for them, create something beautiful to welcome them on this earth. What have you done here for your children?

00:19:29.790 --> 00:19:40.736
I am standing here. Ask for anything and I will give you. But from where can I bring wisdom?

00:19:40.736 --> 00:19:57.015
From where can we borrow the wisdom for you? You have to get your wisdom. It is the only thing I am asking you to get, I am ready to do the rest of the hard work.

00:19:57.015 --> 00:20:03.362
That seed (of wisdom) lies within you. It is absolutely true that the seed lies inside you.

00:20:03.362 --> 00:20:22.729
‘Vaalya’ transformed into ‘Vaalmiki’. The (power) thing by which he got transformed, is also within you.

00:20:22.729 --> 00:20:28.433
He didn’t necessarily want to become Vaalmiki, nor did he have that much wisdom.

00:20:28.433 --> 00:20:37.192
The day he realized that he is killing his soul through his acts for little money, he decided that day only.

00:20:37.192 --> 00:20:51.486
He thought, “for whom I was doing it? I have done so much; what have I done for myself?”

00:20:51.486 --> 00:21:11.075
Think this way once and see what you have done for yourself. I yearn for you and   my soul yearns for you every moment..( I am concerned ).

00:21:11.075 --> 00:21:26.020
I want to light the lamp inside you all – the light which will spread all over the world.

00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:34.231
You will be surprised but it is going to be this country itself – India – that is going to become the light of the world. Don’t be scared. It is only a matter of time.

00:21:34.231 --> 00:21:43.818
Let this time pass. It is you all from this country, who are going to sit on top of the vibrations one day,bear this in mind .

00:21:43.818 --> 00:21:59.759
And there is only one reason for that. We agree everything is messed up in this country

00:21:59.759 --> 00:22:06.107
– but we still haven’t learnt to disrespect our mothers, we still haven’t lost that morality.

00:22:06.107 --> 00:22:18.438
And until this situation changes, the position of this country [in the Kingdom of God] is not going to ever change.

00:22:18.438 --> 00:22:30.361
This is Yoga Bhumi – land of Yoga; this is Bhog Bhumi – land of experience. You are not to decide on this. It has already been decided by the Gods.

00:22:30.361 --> 00:22:37.553
And why do the people born in this country consider themselves inferior only because of scarcity of food?

00:22:37.553 --> 00:22:42.849
Only you people can live like this, not the people in London.

00:22:42.849 --> 00:22:50.145
They start crying even for something as small as the collar of the shirt being long or short.

00:22:50.145 --> 00:22:58.999
You are the true Sanyasis as you can sleep anywhere, can eat whatever and are still happy in everything.

00:22:58.999 --> 00:23:02.600
You have the blessings of your Mother.

00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:14.060
So, if you want to disrespect your Mother, go ahead and do it and then be ready for the consequences!

00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:27.962
This is true that one can be angry or upset with Mother,

00:23:27.962 --> 00:23:40.895
but it is also a fact that the highest relationship in humans is the one with Mother and that one can see(get darshan) God almighty in Her only.

00:23:40.895 --> 00:23:49.104
And only the mothers of this country have the capacity to bear so much.

00:23:49.104 --> 00:23:54.344
Other places, they ask the children to leave the house at a very young age

00:23:54.344 --> 00:24:05.973
And if the children do not help in the chores, they are asked to pay for their food, such are the mothers outside (India).

00:24:05.973 --> 00:24:14.352
The child can die, but the old mother (as old as 90 years) doesn’t want to spend any money as she needs that for her lipstick.

00:24:14.352 --> 00:24:22.434
And see how you honor your Mother.

00:24:22.434 --> 00:24:27.616
Only here such mothers take birth; nowhere in the world you would find a mother like in India.You can go round and see that-

00:24:27.616 --> 00:24:36.984
But you have tortured her so much. Dharma will be lost in this case.

00:24:36.984 --> 00:24:39.111
Do not disrespect dharma.

00:24:39.111 --> 00:24:45.260
Stop all or any plans of humiliating your Mother.

00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:55.355
Return the money. I know everything. Don’t think that I don’t know you!

00:24:55.355 --> 00:25:19.361
[Shri Mataji turns soft again.] Anyways, whatever it is, right now – in this lifetime, now..you need to get your realization.

00:25:19.361 --> 00:25:23.335
Let’s eat the laadoos [sweets] first and then we will sort out the rest.

00:25:23.335 --> 00:25:28.825
What else can make the Mother happy?

00:25:28.825 --> 00:25:35.674
Mother has prepared such nice food for you all and then she has to scold you!

00:25:35.674 --> 00:25:37.770
But I have to do it sometimes.

00:25:37.770 --> 00:25:41.291
So now relax and sit down to eat.

00:25:41.291 --> 00:25:45.755
Eat your food in a relaxed mood.

00:25:45.755 --> 00:25:54.595
And take the amrut [nectar], acquire the amrut.

00:25:54.595 --> 00:26:01.595
Let this amrut in the form of love, flow through you into the entire world. Here we are set on changing the course of this world

00:26:01.595 --> 00:26:05.482
– and you are still involved with these petty nuisances.

00:26:05.482 --> 00:26:13.154
All these things are going to be recorded in the history of this world – keep that in mind, all the people who have committed such stupidities.

00:26:13.154 --> 00:26:18.490
Each name will be remembered, and people will spit upon them.

00:26:18.490 --> 00:26:27.770
Not only their children but generations will be blamed for those wrongdoings. So, these were the dirty people who did these dirty deeds!

00:26:27.770 --> 00:26:38.264
Do the work which will be considered bright! Enlighten yourself.  That is what the Mother wants to give to her children.

00:26:38.264 --> 00:26:51.954
Go into meditation – close your eyes.

00:26:51.954 --> 00:27:01.444
[Shri Mataji is speaking in Hindi]
The talk I had to give today, it had to be in Marathi. You see,without Marathi you cannot get the same fun ,

00:27:01.444 --> 00:27:08.447
I can’t manage to do the same in Hindi. I can manage only in Marathi!

00:27:08.447 --> 00:27:24.027
So, forgive me if I didn’t speak in Hindi. Forgive me again as I had to tell some things to some specific people – it was not meant for you.

00:27:24.027 --> 00:27:31.207
[Shri Mataji again speaking in Marathi] [Someone in the audience asks a question referring to some guru.] Don’t say names. At least, for the time being, do not blame.

00:27:31.207 --> 00:27:47.871
Many people are lost. People have gone to many different (so called) gurus. What is a guru, who is a Guru, who is not; who is Guru, who is animal – how to recognize it – one feels it inside.

00:27:47.871 --> 00:27:51.543
You can recognize it through vibrations.

00:27:51.543 --> 00:27:55.944
The vibrations flowing from your hand can tell you who the real guru is and who is not.

00:27:55.944 --> 00:27:59.172
So first learn how to get that awareness and then decide who a real guru is. Why are you making anyone a guru before like mad men?

00:27:59.172 --> 00:28:05.730
Get the eyes to see the real guru. Until then keep all the gurus aside. Keep them away.

00:28:05.730 --> 00:28:11.641
For now, you are your own guru, and I am your Mother.
