WEBVTT

00:00.444 --> 00:09.011
… the most honorable sahaja yogi,
Justice Vaidya,

00:09.440 --> 00:13.226
and his most loving wife.

00:16.088 --> 00:21.965
Mr. Bakshi, (…tape interruption…) Dhumal,

00:23.416 --> 00:28.383
Mr. Gavin Brown who is an archeologist,

00:28.584 --> 00:31.807
Dr. Pramila Sharma, who is a Professor
of Hindi

00:32.008 --> 00:37.264
and is a Master of Kabira’s literature,

00:38.720 --> 00:43.539
and then Mrs. Jane Brown who is
a geologist,

00:43.740 --> 00:47.319
they are from Cambridge University;

00:47.559 --> 00:53.151
and our wise chairman Mr. Zachre,

00:53.716 --> 00:59.368
also the gracious singer Mrs. Shobha Gotu

00:59.569 --> 01:04.268
who has been very kind to come and sing,
and in Marathi she said:

01:04.469 --> 01:09.375
"I'm unable to do anything else, so Mother,
I will just sing two bhajans for You."

01:10.813 --> 01:15.204
All the sahaja yogis who have come here,

01:15.405 --> 01:22.502
all the other people who have joined us
here,

01:23.183 --> 01:27.591
who are celebrating this earthly birthday
of mine…

01:27.792 --> 01:31.816
I am very thankful, very grateful

01:32.017 --> 01:37.286
and I am filled with great joy
and happiness.

01:38.019 --> 01:42.252
And my vibrations are flowing from my eyes
as tears to see

01:42.453 --> 01:48.972
that, in this Kaliyuga also, there are
people who are grateful to a Mother

01:49.173 --> 01:53.738
who just gives a abstract thing known
as vibrations.

01:53.939 --> 01:59.588
Actually I do not give you… I cannot give
or take, you’ll be surprised.

01:59.789 --> 02:04.544
It is just emitted through me. It is
my ‘swabhava’ [innate nature].

02:05.057 --> 02:08.877
It has to be that way, I can’t help it.

02:09.078 --> 02:15.448
It is a ‘being’ that is being. You cannot
make it something else.

02:15.649 --> 02:19.098
It acts on its own; it goes on working.

02:19.299 --> 02:24.477
It is beyond me to control myself from
loving all of you.

02:25.100 --> 02:28.220
I do not know how people learn to hate.

02:28.421 --> 02:31.874
I haven’t got sufficient time even to love
people.

02:32.075 --> 02:35.352
I find twenty-four hours much less!

02:35.553 --> 02:41.555
I do not know how people sit down
and manipulate and think

02:41.756 --> 02:48.237
in a ice-cold manner how to be hateful.

02:48.438 --> 02:53.127
Hatred has no power but of destruction -
of yourself and others.

02:53.328 --> 02:58.301
On this day I would request you to think
of love all the time.

02:58.502 --> 03:02.728
Love is all knowledge. Knowledge is
all love.

03:02.929 --> 03:05.657
There is nothing beyond them.

03:05.858 --> 03:11.001
If you have knowledge, it has to pass
the test of love.

03:11.666 --> 03:17.417
If you know a person, it makes no record
on you

03:17.618 --> 03:22.628
because you know him from outside.
But if you love a person,

03:22.829 --> 03:25.682
then you know the person out and out.

03:25.883 --> 03:31.048
You know him so well, you know him
everything, the way it is.

03:31.249 --> 03:36.215
It is this knowledge that is what we call
is the ‘para’-knowledge.

03:36.416 --> 03:38.589
That is the knowledge we have to seek.

03:38.790 --> 03:43.300
All these books are only signaling towards
that.

03:43.501 --> 03:47.982
They are the milestones, which are telling
us, “Go ahead, go ahead.”

03:48.183 --> 03:52.167
They do not solve the problem of entering
into the kingdom of God.

03:52.368 --> 03:56.972
I request you that you all should come
to the stage

03:57.173 --> 04:02.851
of understanding the Divine within you,
the love of God

04:03.052 --> 04:06.259
that is within you, which is trying
to overflow from you,

04:06.460 --> 04:09.792
and enjoy the sense of emitting and giving.

04:09.993 --> 04:13.023
Giving has the greatest joy and pleasure.

04:13.224 --> 04:19.302
There is no pleasure in taking. And when
you receive it, you start giving.

04:19.508 --> 04:24.665
You have heard Dhumal talking about how
he has done work in Rahuri.

04:24.866 --> 04:28.039
In Rahuri, when I was going to Rahuri
University,

04:28.240 --> 04:32.639
the people in the nearby village knew
that our car will be going that way.

04:32.840 --> 04:36.567
They are ordinary villagers. They have
never read any Yoga;

04:36.768 --> 04:40.329
they don’t understand anything more about
vibrations

04:40.530 --> 04:44.695
than these feelings that you get.
It's a subjective knowledge.

04:44.896 --> 04:47.214
It has no words. It's a subjective
experience,

04:47.415 --> 04:52.200
which you feel on your fingers, in your
being - the bliss of God.

04:52.401 --> 04:56.371
And as I was going, I just felt a jerk
in the car,

04:56.603 --> 04:59.007
because so many people were just lying
on the road

04:59.208 --> 05:02.047
and some were standing on the road stopping
the car,

05:02.248 --> 05:05.835
and they started shouting My ‘jai’
[Victory]. I was wonderstruck!

05:06.036 --> 05:08.182
I said, “How did you know that I was
in this car?”

05:08.350 --> 05:10.801
He said, “Mataji, You have given us
vibrations.

05:11.002 --> 05:13.419
We knew this was the car, which was
bringing us vibrations.

05:13.620 --> 05:17.553
So, now You have to get down here.” I just
got down; I embraced all of them,

05:17.754 --> 05:21.845
and our sahaja yogis were waiting at
the other end. I said, “ Doesn’t matter.”

05:22.046 --> 05:26.613
This is what is Sahaja - such loving people!
And at that time, I just thought of

05:26.814 --> 05:30.289
how once with Rama - how you felt those
things

05:30.490 --> 05:35.305
with people, with very simple people, of
very simple heart with ‘Shraddha’ [Faith],

05:35.506 --> 05:42.157
how they had those feelings of receiving
your love and feeling it.

05:42.513 --> 05:46.465
Everyone needs love in this world; you
cannot exist without love.

05:46.666 --> 05:49.932
Your whole being is based on love.

05:50.133 --> 05:53.873
And I wish all of you in this country
to understand

05:54.074 --> 05:59.676
that unless and until there is love in your
heart, don’t try to do anything outside

05:59.877 --> 06:02.730
because if you do it you will be found out
in no time.

06:02.931 --> 06:06.475
Every human being understands what is love.

06:06.676 --> 06:09.161
There are lots of things that are happening
within you.

06:09.362 --> 06:12.966
There are cosmic changes that are taking
place today within you.

06:13.167 --> 06:17.464
I know that it's happening. The Shri
Chakra itself has descended on this Earth

06:17.665 --> 06:20.254
and already the Satya Yuga has started.

06:20.455 --> 06:23.621
This is the reason, why you are feeling
these vibrations on your fingers

06:23.822 --> 06:28.107
and none of these Gurus and Rishis and all
those people have mentioned these things.

06:28.308 --> 06:32.010
Because this is only possible when
the Shri Chakra is brought down.

06:32.226 --> 06:35.512
It is here. You have to feel it and
understand it.

06:35.689 --> 06:40.048
It is for all of you to accept it with
an open heart.

06:40.249 --> 06:44.024
I do not want anything from you.
What can you give me?

06:44.225 --> 06:48.441
I do not want anything, but I want
my children to be happy.

06:48.642 --> 06:52.899
I pray for their happiness. I live for them
and all the time,

06:53.100 --> 06:57.901
whether I am asleep or awakened or
in the middle state,

06:58.102 --> 07:01.453
when they call the ‘sabhranta’, I'm just
with you.

07:01.654 --> 07:04.353
Every moment you are in My thoughts.

07:04.554 --> 07:09.442
I wish all of you a very, very happy New
Year today because it is Navroz

07:09.643 --> 07:15.176
and Navroz is the day when Zartosht started
His work on this world.

07:15.377 --> 07:21.917
He was a great sahaja yogi. He was
an incarnation of Dattatreya Himself.

07:22.118 --> 07:27.549
...has told you about Mohammad sahib
I have to tell you that He was My father

07:27.750 --> 07:33.685
and He was the incarnation of Dattatreya
Himself. He was not an ordinary person.

07:33.886 --> 07:38.773
Though the people tortured His life. Every
moment that He lived they tortured Him.

07:38.974 --> 07:43.309
And Hazrat Ali is a very, very great
incarnation

07:43.510 --> 07:47.693
where only once, only once Brahmadeva
has incarnated

07:47.894 --> 07:52.107
and He has incarnated as Hazrat Ali.
So, these people are so great!

07:52.308 --> 07:54.898
You cannot criticize them. They are
so great -

07:55.099 --> 07:57.981
every word that they have spoken is
a Mantra.

07:58.182 --> 08:02.361
Everything they have told you about
this ‘namaaz’,

08:02.562 --> 08:05.132
it is nothing but Kundalini ‘jagruti’
[awakening].

08:05.333 --> 08:08.233
Mohammad Sahib has done the greatest
work in Sahaja Yoga

08:08.434 --> 08:11.784
and has done the greatest advancement

08:11.985 --> 08:16.298
as far as the Kundalini jagruti is
concerned. How can you criticize Him?

08:16.499 --> 08:20.547
I can’t bear to hear even a word about -
against Him.

08:20.748 --> 08:23.313
I know how much He has been tortured.

08:23.514 --> 08:28.690
And the same people, today, are born in
this country who are talking against Him.

08:28.891 --> 08:35.039
When you cannot reach even at His feet,
why should you take such a big step?

08:35.240 --> 08:39.665
Understand what have you done in life?
What have you got with yourself,

08:39.866 --> 08:43.362
that you are criticizing these great
personalities?

08:43.563 --> 08:47.145
Khwaja Nizamuddin Saheb was a great Auliya
[saint] – no doubt about it.

08:47.330 --> 08:50.359
And a horrible king like Khilji tried
to trouble Him,

08:50.560 --> 08:54.968
and he was himself murdered! And his name
has gone to the dying dust.

08:55.169 --> 08:58.629
Today, Khwaja Nizamuddin Saheb…
you go and see the vibrations there!

08:58.830 --> 09:03.856
You go and see a Chisti… Chisti’s Maqbara
[tomb] also

09:04.057 --> 09:08.671
at Ajmer Sharif - you will see the same.
At Patna, you go and see Patna Saheb,

09:08.872 --> 09:14.580
where you have got our Mahavir Saheb also -
vibrations are there.

09:14.781 --> 09:18.539
All these people are speaking of the same
truth I am telling you.

09:18.740 --> 09:21.621
But today you can make them out.
You will know who they are.

09:21.822 --> 09:23.686
Please try to humble down yourself.

09:23.887 --> 09:26.678
First of all, get this eternal truth within
yourself.

09:26.879 --> 09:31.595
Let your being be that subjective
instrument, to understand what is God.

09:31.771 --> 09:35.798
Don’t be driven away by few readings
here and few readings there.

09:35.999 --> 09:42.056
Don’t be driven away by the small-hearted
ideas and the egoistical tomfoolery

09:42.225 --> 09:45.455
that is going on - is to make fun
of everyone. Oh Man!

09:45.656 --> 09:50.139
Please awaken yourself to this great
occasion of understanding.

09:50.340 --> 09:53.068
This dynamic force is dying to bubble out
of you.

09:53.269 --> 09:58.449
We have to change this world and transform
it into a beautiful creation,

09:58.650 --> 10:02.358
because the Creator will not allow
His creation to be destroyed.

10:02.559 --> 10:06.672
If you do not accept the truth, you will be
destroyed.

10:06.873 --> 10:12.266
So please, please, again as a Mother,
I ask you

10:12.467 --> 10:18.831
to accept the Divine truth, the Divine love
and to be one with it.

10:19.032 --> 10:26.070
I wish all of you, all the sahaja yogis and
all the people who are seeking God,

10:26.271 --> 10:32.173
the greatest of greatest, highest
of highest achievement

10:32.374 --> 10:37.378
in the awareness of God and His love.
That is what it is.

10:37.579 --> 10:41.375
Otherwise, the rest of it is all useless.
Those who have sought

10:41.576 --> 10:46.354
other kind of satwik or tamasik things
in life have gone to waste.

10:46.555 --> 10:49.817
They have gone to hell and they are
completely destroyed.

10:50.018 --> 10:54.142
You do not want to do that. You are simple
people, ordinary people

10:54.343 --> 10:56.931
and that's why you are the best people,

10:57.132 --> 10:59.764
because you do not suffer from any
extremes.

10:59.965 --> 11:04.628
You have a very simple heart. You are
leading a very religious life

11:04.829 --> 11:09.856
and a sanctified married life. This place
is for the people

11:10.073 --> 11:13.098
who are in the middle path of Lord Buddha.

11:13.299 --> 11:17.779
Sahaja Yoga is the integration of all the
truths of life and I can prove it to you,

11:17.980 --> 11:22.229
on the Kundalini, that what I say is
the fact – is the fact.

11:22.430 --> 11:24.385
Unless and until you take Hazrat Ali’s
name.

11:24.585 --> 11:28.872
your Swadisthan Chakra cannot be cured,
and all the sahaja yogis know about it.

11:29.073 --> 11:31.829
And in the sahaja yogi Puja we have to take

11:32.030 --> 11:35.638
the name of Mohammed Saheb again and again
and that of Hazrat Ali.

11:35.839 --> 11:41.292
And also we have to take the name of Jesus
the Lord,

11:41.493 --> 11:45.631
who is the ‘Ashraya’ [Refuge] of all this
world, described by Shri Krishna

11:45.828 --> 11:48.086
in the Bhagavad Gita - He was
the Mahavishnu.

11:48.287 --> 11:51.708
You can read it for yourself and you will
be surprised that all the things

11:51.909 --> 11:56.907
described about Mahavishnu are absolutely
the same as Jesus Christ was.

11:57.108 --> 11:59.508
So, I request you not to be so small-minded.

11:59.709 --> 12:02.826
You have not known the truth so far.
So, try to understand it –

12:03.027 --> 12:06.138
to be subjective, to feel it,
to understand it.

12:06.339 --> 12:08.914
All the books are saying the same thing
as I am saying.

12:09.115 --> 12:12.001
Only thing, I can do it. I am not doing it.

12:12.202 --> 12:14.977
It is just happening. I have come
on this Earth

12:15.178 --> 12:18.519
just for this ignition. This is the last
point of ignition.

12:18.720 --> 12:22.638
This has to happen and this will happen.
Let us see, in this country,

12:22.839 --> 12:26.197
in this beautiful Yoga Bhumi, how many
people accept it.

12:26.398 --> 12:29.600
May God bless you all. Again and again
I bless you.

12:29.801 --> 12:33.012
I am going to now London on the 25th
and hope,

12:33.213 --> 12:37.336
all of you who have got realization in last
two days, will again

12:37.537 --> 12:41.980
come to our program in Bharathiya Vidya
Bhavan on Tuesday we have at 6.30.

12:42.181 --> 12:47.631
We have also a very nice center
in Altamount road.

12:47.832 --> 12:53.215
You can take the address from here,
on Altamount Road there is a very nice

12:53.416 --> 12:57.643
ground floor flat we have got, in front
of the beauty parlour -

12:57.844 --> 12:59.785
Kamal beauty parlour or something
like that.

12:59.986 --> 13:06.170
It is the flat of Miss Moraji who has
kindly given us this flat for use.

13:06.393 --> 13:09.672
I hope all of you will take deeper interest
into Sahaja Yog,

13:09.873 --> 13:12.990
learn all the methods and master
the Kundalini.

13:13.166 --> 13:17.046
There are so many people among us who
know about it and you can talk to them;

13:17.247 --> 13:20.958
even in the programs you can listen to my
lectures by which you will understand.

13:21.159 --> 13:23.872
But it is not the understanding through
your hearing,

13:24.073 --> 13:26.773
but it is the understanding through
your heart

13:26.974 --> 13:31.299
and through your feeling of vibrations
only, you can judge the Kundalini.

13:31.500 --> 13:37.881
Yesterday I have very much requested you
and again I am requesting you

13:38.082 --> 13:41.257
that to understand Sahaja Yoga, you don’t
need too much of brains.

13:41.458 --> 13:45.641
What you need is a heart, is
a 'Shraddha-van' [with faith] heart.

13:45.842 --> 13:48.907
And if you have that, it will work out.
The time has come

13:49.108 --> 13:52.370
for many flowers to be fruits. The time
is there.

13:52.571 --> 13:57.080
I thank you again and again for showing
this great love to me. It’s like a…

13:57.281 --> 14:03.755
when I feel the ocean of my love, when it
flows to the shores of all your hearts,

14:03.956 --> 14:07.764
the shore gives it back as a reaction.
It’s a parabolic movement.

14:07.965 --> 14:11.962
When my love passes through you and comes
back to me as love,

14:12.186 --> 14:15.702
I enjoy it. It is such a beautiful
experience.

14:15.903 --> 14:18.784
I mean, it is a different experience,
perhaps,

14:18.985 --> 14:23.972
that cannot be coined or put into these
mortal words.

14:24.173 --> 14:27.384
Thank you very much again and again.
I thank all the trustees

14:27.585 --> 14:32.104
and all of you again and again. May God
bless you with all His prosperity,

14:32.305 --> 14:36.411
with all His goodness, kindness and
the Eternal.

14:36.612 --> 14:42.313
The Paramachaitanya should descend on you
and on your awareness.
