00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:07.029
I'm really sorry for getting so late...It
happens and whatever happens one has to accept.

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:11.360
That's how the Divine works.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:16.260
Everything has some reasons.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:30.230
Now, they must been able to explain to you
what centers we have within ourselves and

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:43.120
he has told you 
what is the mechanism within ourselves.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:53.660
It is all built within us during the different
periods of our evolution.

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:59.630
Every center is built like that.

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:09.590
Now, all this is built, like a pathway.

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:18.119
By left and right you create the central path
of your ascent.

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:31.689
And when this pure energy of your desire ascends,
is awakened, then it pierces through the last

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:48.039
center what we call as Sahasrara, meaning
the thousand petalled centre, which is the

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:58.700
brain, we can say, or part of the brain which
covers the limbic area.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:17.030
The Spirit is the reflection of God Almighty
and it resides in our heart.

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:28.020
When the Kundalini touches the Sahastrara,
the seat of the Spirit, which is reflected

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:33.240
in the heart, gets enlightened.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:41.280
That doesn't mean the Spirit gets enlightened
but the attention is like a sari, which is

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:52.400
pushed in like this, [AND] when it touches,
it pierces through and the Spirit in the heart,

00:02:52.400 --> 00:03:02.120
which has the seat here, starts entering into
our central nervous system.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.070
So the first feeling you get is a cool breeze
on top of your head.

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:11.210
That's the first feeling.

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:20.600
Second feeling you get is All Pervading Power
because now you have entered into the subtle

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:25.350
area of your awareness.

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:33.670
Human awareness is gross first but when you
touch the Spirit, you become thoughtlessly

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:42.150
aware but there is no thought, the grossness
goes away because thoughts disappear.

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.320
And you become subtler.

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:52.480
This subtleness gives you certain powers.

00:03:52.480 --> 00:04:04.640
The first power that you get is that you become,
your awareness becomes collectively conscious.

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:13.990
That you can feel another person on your fingertips
- that means you become absolutely aware.

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:23.800
Like I went today to Mexico and I could feel
the whole country, I knew about it before

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.449
but my attention was not so deeply there.

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:36.550
I could feel the whole country has a very
bad left side problem and the left side problem

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:45.950
is affecting even this area and the left side
problem you can feel it very clearly that

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:55.750
your left side becomes heavy and you feel
the heat in all your centers.

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:09.850
So you start feeling the atmosphere, the country,
the people and individual and yourself.

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:13.199
So you know the problem of a particular place.

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:21.310
I mean you may not feel that much in the beginning,
you may just feel yourself to begin with.

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:31.639
Then you start feeling others, so thus the
awareness grows more and more.

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:44.400
In the central nervous system you start feeling
the problems of other people, your own problems.

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:51.960
But it is not that you feel them as something,
which is painful or troublesome, but you feel

00:05:51.960 --> 00:06:03.439
them as little heat or sometimes little pain,
very little, as if you are recording it like

00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:04.999
a barometer.

00:06:04.999 --> 00:06:14.229
And when that happens you want to get rid
of it as if they are your own problem, and

00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:17.689
if you know how to get rid of it you can do
it.

00:06:17.689 --> 00:06:24.809
That's what I was doing and that's how I'm
late, something on the collective.

00:06:24.809 --> 00:06:34.520
If you are working on something you want to
finish the job and then you want to attend

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:36.680
to another.

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:42.360
Don't want to leave something half done.

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:50.870
For human beings it is difficult in the beginning,
because from human awareness you are rising

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:59.120
to super human awareness or you can call it
to super awareness, into a subtler awareness.

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:05.939
So first the awareness is gross and then your
awareness becomes subtler.

00:07:05.939 --> 00:07:19.889
But with that you do not fell in any way uncomfortable
or upset, because you become extremely powerful.

00:07:19.889 --> 00:07:30.500
Such power of compassion, that you don't feel
anything, no pain, no problems, the illusions

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:33.110
disappear completely.

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:36.599
There's no more illusion in the mind.

00:07:36.599 --> 00:07:48.150
Like people say that when you face something
you are filled with the greed, or greed or

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:49.150
lust.

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:56.360
But when your eyes become pure, there is no
greed or lust.

00:07:56.360 --> 00:08:10.449
But what happens that you start feeling the
oneness with another thing, whatever it is,

00:08:10.449 --> 00:08:13.169
in a way that it is joy giving.

00:08:13.169 --> 00:08:23.740
Like you see someone, an attractive person,
there is no sensation of [BERSERK] feelings

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:38.630
for that person but the sensation just disappears
and you start feeling the joy of the creation

00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:41.979
of that person or the thing.

00:08:41.979 --> 00:08:46.389
Like in Mexico, people have made so many things
with hand.

00:08:46.389 --> 00:08:54.550
If you watch them you might think how much
it will cost, what will be the price, who

00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:55.930
has made it.

00:08:55.930 --> 00:09:05.630
But if there is no thought then you see something,
which looks very joyous, because you can feel

00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:07.160
the vibrations.

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:13.750
And you know somebody has made it, who might
have been a Realized soul, who might have

00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:22.529
been a very great devotee of God, might have
been a person who must have thought that:

00:09:22.529 --> 00:09:27.730
"This is your creation, oh God."

00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:35.589
Such a person might have made with that feeling
which is to be gratified and you feel that

00:09:35.589 --> 00:09:37.300
we should take it.

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:44.269
The matter has only one capacity that it gives
joy in giving to others, so that you can express

00:09:44.269 --> 00:09:46.040
your happiness into it.

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:52.690
So you become very subtly aware of the matter,
that you start understanding the matter, what

00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:57.910
it means and what is the use of a particular
thing.

00:09:57.910 --> 00:10:06.040
In the same way, when you meet people, new
people, absolutely never known, you know what

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:13.370
are their needs, what problems they have,
on a wider scale, on a collective scale, and

00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:27.800
also you know one simple thing that there
are people in Mexico, who are seeking God,

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:33.920
who are to be helped, who are to be given
something that they want.

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:39.540
They may not be so much aware of it but we
become aware of them.

00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:48.069
And a kind of a rapport of a very subtle type
is established and you get attracted towards

00:10:48.069 --> 00:11:00.420
other people not through any lust or greed
or any purpose but in oneness with the joy

00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:05.210
that they have within themselves, the joy
of the Spirit.

00:11:05.210 --> 00:11:16.699
You look at them and you feel: "This person
is such a wonderful person".

00:11:16.699 --> 00:11:17.899
How do you know?

00:11:17.899 --> 00:11:23.680
You start feeling the cool vibrations in your
hand from that person.

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:30.709
And you just enjoy that person for that person's
sake, not for anything, whether poor, rich,

00:11:30.709 --> 00:11:34.790
good looking, bad looking, doesn't matter.

00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:40.290
You approach the Spirit of another person
because you have become the Spirit.

00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:48.940
People talk of big things, of organizing peace
missions, this mission, that mission, to create

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:51.470
a better relationship.

00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:58.819
All relationships, which are at a gross level
create problems, because there is some sort

00:11:58.819 --> 00:12:02.820
of a lurking selfishness behind it.

00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:10.300
But once it becomes the spiritual relationship
you just enjoy the other person without getting

00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:21.459
into any discussion about what is your gain,
what is you are going to achieve through going

00:12:21.459 --> 00:12:23.759
nearer to that personality.

00:12:23.759 --> 00:12:31.250
Thus you become the receiver of the joy.

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:41.800
Like a lake, which is ripleless, which is
absolutely quiet and looks like a mirror.

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:55.360
It reflects all that is created round it completely
and emits complete joy of the creation.

00:12:55.360 --> 00:13:03.709
In the same way the heart, which is filled
with the light of the Spirit, reflects the

00:13:03.709 --> 00:13:11.890
complete joy of the creation of another person.

00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:16.540
Whatever it has in a subtle way you enjoyed.

00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:29.660
Then the time, you don't see, you go beyond
time, you go beyond time, you are not bothered

00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:30.889
about time.

00:13:30.889 --> 00:13:39.160
Everything has got a proper timing and you
start understanding that this is the time

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:40.600
it was to be.

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:48.300
You don't become a slave of time, you don't
become slave of any habits, you don't become

00:13:48.300 --> 00:14:03.959
slave of any temptations, but you enjoy the
complete freedom of enjoying the joy.

00:14:03.959 --> 00:14:15.519
For example we are very tight thinking what
is to be done next, what this has to be, but

00:14:15.519 --> 00:14:22.069
then you start seeing the purpose of your
life.

00:14:22.069 --> 00:14:27.779
Like one day we had to have a Puja or a kind
of a worship.

00:14:27.779 --> 00:14:36.380
They said: "We'll start at about 9 o'clock"
as it is today something happened.

00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:40.490
And I said: "Alright, we'll start at 9.00."

00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:45.670
But I knew 9.00 was not all right so I reached
the place at 11.00.

00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:48.529
Of course those who had to stay, would've
stayed on.

00:14:48.529 --> 00:14:57.300
Because you need people who understand that
time has no meaning when it is the Spirit.

00:14:57.300 --> 00:15:03.480
And I said: "Now, just see the Panchanga,
that book which we consult for timing."

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:05.170
They said: "Today is the dark night Damasya."

00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:08.079
"And when does it end?"

00:15:08.079 --> 00:15:09.600
"Just now."

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:13.319
I said: "That's it."

00:15:13.319 --> 00:15:20.180
So everything, the timing, everything has
to be worked out according to the need of

00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:25.709
the Spirit and not need of the gross.

00:15:25.709 --> 00:15:34.420
When that happens you [GO or KNOW] smoothly
and understandingly the whole pattern of the

00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:38.000
Divine how it works out.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:48.529
And that is how you understand the dynamism
of time, because you live in the present not

00:15:48.529 --> 00:15:52.319
in the future or in the past.

00:15:52.319 --> 00:15:58.120
Actually the past doesn't exist and future
has not come, we don't know what future is.

00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:02.129
To come in the present you have to be the
Spirit.

00:16:02.129 --> 00:16:09.660
And when you are in the Spirit then you realize
that this present is the reality, the rest

00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:12.699
is a myth.

00:16:12.699 --> 00:16:22.519
When the Kundalini rises She passes attention
into an area or She penetrates into an area

00:16:22.519 --> 00:16:32.790
where there is silence because a thought rises
and falls off, another thought rises and falls

00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:33.790
off.

00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:40.180
In between these two thoughts this area exists,
of the present.

00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:48.579
Now...But if I say you stop at this point,
to be at this point, you cannot.

00:16:48.579 --> 00:16:55.570
Your mind is jumping either on the past or
on the future.

00:16:55.570 --> 00:17:06.829
But the Kundalini is the only thing that stops
you at present moment so that you don't consider

00:17:06.829 --> 00:17:16.100
the past and the future but you enjoy the
present, the complete dynamism of the present

00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:21.880
and you are effective, you are dynamic.

00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:31.220
You can do thousand and one thing, which normally
you cannot do and you are surprised how it

00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:33.360
works out.

00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:39.890
The Divine has Its own plans, has Its own
understanding and we cannot make the Divine

00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:41.690
to work as we want.

00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:49.500
We have to accept whatever the Divine does
and manages and then we see the miracles of

00:17:49.500 --> 00:18:00.039
the Divine and we are surprised how efficient
It is, how beautiful It is, like a machine.

00:18:00.039 --> 00:18:09.470
We feel the efficiency of the Divine but above
all we feel the compassion, the love, the

00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:11.360
understanding of the Divine.

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:14.080
But first we must rise up to that.

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:20.140
And for that one has to grow in the awareness
of the Spirit.

00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:27.710
If we cannot develop the awareness of the
Spirit, we loose that magnitude which we have

00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:29.970
to achieve.

00:18:29.970 --> 00:18:39.590
So what is to be respected is the Spirit after
Realization, because it gives you the truth.

00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:45.529
To understand the truth you have to be the
Spirit, otherwise whatever you understand

00:18:45.529 --> 00:18:49.350
is falsehood, is not the truth.

00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:55.850
Because of your mental projection you think
that that is the truth, is not so.

00:18:55.850 --> 00:19:06.710
For example now, if I am sitting on this chair
you won't know anytime that I ever sat on

00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:08.070
this chair.

00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:15.100
But supposing there's a Realized soul who
comes round, immediately he will know that

00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:18.330
there was someone like Me.

00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:24.529
For example I say that Mozart was a Realized
soul.

00:19:24.529 --> 00:19:26.230
How do I know?

00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:28.460
He's dead now.

00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:33.940
Because you can feel it on vibrations that
he was a Realized soul.

00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:37.640
I say: "Abraham Lincoln was a Realized soul."

00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:43.159
Not because the way he lived or what he did,
that what just an expression or was the symptom

00:19:43.159 --> 00:19:53.370
of his greatness but because when you think
of him you get cool breeze in your hands,

00:19:53.370 --> 00:20:00.520
tremendously cool breeze, soothing, which
crawls over you: "Oh, that's Abraham Lincoln."

00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:11.090
We do not know where we spend our time, what
people are important to us till we are the

00:20:11.090 --> 00:20:12.090
Spirit.

00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:21.320
We waste our time catering to something absolutely
useless, and then suddenly we discover: "Oh,

00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:27.950
God, what a waste of time, what a waste of
energy, what a waste of money.

00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:29.779
This man was a cheat.

00:20:29.779 --> 00:20:31.549
He cheated me.

00:20:31.549 --> 00:20:33.720
This work was all falsehood.

00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:36.779
Why did I waste my time there?

00:20:36.779 --> 00:20:40.750
After Realization you become the absolute.

00:20:40.750 --> 00:20:49.100
There is no relative value, you do not judge
anything relatively, you just know what is

00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:56.610
absolute and once you know the absolute you
are quite sure about it, there's no wavering.

00:20:56.610 --> 00:21:04.390
Thus you become an extremely powerful person
and you know the truth about everything.

00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:12.380
Now the truth is very simple that you are
the Spirit and you are not this body, you

00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:19.950
are not this mind and you are not this ego
or your conditionings but you are the free

00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:23.290
Spirit, that's the truth is.

00:21:23.290 --> 00:21:35.100
But it is not just a mental truth but is actually
so and has to be actualized.

00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:40.500
The third thing that happens to you apart
from your awareness becoming the truth, the

00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:47.970
complete knowledge, you become the source
of joy, not that you only receive the joy

00:21:47.970 --> 00:21:56.400
but you become the source of joy, the source
of bliss and the source of peace.

00:21:56.400 --> 00:22:00.340
Wherever such a person goes, it just sooths.

00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:09.640
Yesterday you saw a lady, she had very stiff
fingers, she couldn't move them... and as

00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:13.580
soon as I said: "What's wrong with your fingers?"

00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:15.539
she started moving them.

00:22:15.539 --> 00:22:18.110
She was amazed how she started moving.

00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:20.600
Just my attention, just one question.

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:25.169
I said: "What's wrong with your hands?"

00:22:25.169 --> 00:22:26.559
she just started moving.

00:22:26.559 --> 00:22:28.070
She said: "Am I cured?"

00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:35.770
First she said is some nervous trouble and
then she saw: "Oh, it's moving, it's all right,

00:22:35.770 --> 00:22:36.770
cured."

00:22:36.770 --> 00:22:37.770
How?

00:22:37.770 --> 00:22:42.400
Because you get that power within yourself
of compassion, which doesn't expect any thing,

00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:47.240
it just works and acts silently.

00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:51.850
Just paying attention to that person itself,
it's sufficient.

00:22:51.850 --> 00:23:01.059
Just one glance at that person can save that
person from any kind of malady.

00:23:01.059 --> 00:23:10.320
It works but of course it is true also those
who are not deserving at all, those who are

00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:21.250
crooked people, those who are cruel, say for
example Hitler, you cannot give him Realization,

00:23:21.250 --> 00:23:24.320
can you?

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:27.309
He has to suffer.

00:23:27.309 --> 00:23:37.640
So, also these illusions that we have about
people, [THAT OH], we should be kind to everyone,

00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:38.940
we should be nice.

00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:46.169
The kindness of the Divine to the crooks is
not the way we look at it.

00:23:46.169 --> 00:23:50.470
The kindness to the crooks is punishment.

00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:52.320
It's a wrathful God.

00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:55.570
It punishes crooks.

00:23:55.570 --> 00:24:03.240
Many people feel that, I mean it's a [MEREST]
mental attitude to say that everything is

00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:08.140
illusion, so crookery is also an illusion.

00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:12.399
It is not.

00:24:12.399 --> 00:24:18.330
For you it is just a mental attitude, that's
all.

00:24:18.330 --> 00:24:24.519
For the people who are in the boat is all
right to say that the ocean is an illusion

00:24:24.519 --> 00:24:27.890
but not for the people who are in the water.

00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:36.160
That's just a mental problem that they think
it's not an illusion or a illusion, it is

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:40.840
not the fact with them, it's not actually
with them.

00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:48.750
But once you rise above that, to you it is
an illusion but to the Divine it's a duty

00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:50.580
to correct it.

00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:53.090
And Divine looks after you.

00:24:53.090 --> 00:24:59.299
All the blessings of the Divine starts showering
upon you and you are amazed how it has worked,

00:24:59.299 --> 00:25:03.840
how it has helped you, how it has done good
to you.

00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:12.690
You are amazed how all the things that you
desire you get, your desires change, you ask

00:25:12.690 --> 00:25:17.019
for something and you just get it.

00:25:17.019 --> 00:25:23.570
Because these desires that are there are based
on something that Divine wants.

00:25:23.570 --> 00:25:30.590
Like one we had a doctor who was working in
Riad, and he had a feeling that he should

00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:37.679
go to Abba, which is a place very much down
trodden and where he thought Sahaja Yoga will

00:25:37.679 --> 00:25:39.500
work better.

00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:43.500
So he was very anxious, he wrote a very anxious
letter to Me, that: "Mother, please see that

00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:45.019
I go to Abba."

00:25:45.019 --> 00:25:48.799
That letter he had just posted, he tried his
level best, he couldn't do it.

00:25:48.799 --> 00:25:55.170
Had just posted, I never received it, even
then he got the appointment.

00:25:55.170 --> 00:25:58.390
So, the whole attitude towards life changes.

00:25:58.390 --> 00:26:03.320
Like today if you ask Sahaja Yogis, they said:
"Mother, we must go to Mexico."

00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:05.169
I said: "How far is?"

00:26:05.169 --> 00:26:06.279
"Fifteen, twenty minutes."

00:26:06.279 --> 00:26:07.279
"All right."

00:26:07.279 --> 00:26:12.210
The reason is they wanted Me to put My attention
to Mexico.

00:26:12.210 --> 00:26:15.049
They are not limited to America only.

00:26:15.049 --> 00:26:17.529
Now, Mexico is important to them.

00:26:17.529 --> 00:26:20.049
Let's do how we work it out.

00:26:20.049 --> 00:26:23.090
Otherwise people could have had some other
desires, other things.

00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:30.270
Little desires like having a house, having
a car, having a job, these are all fulfilled

00:26:30.270 --> 00:26:31.270
in no time.

00:26:31.270 --> 00:26:32.970
There's no problem on them.

00:26:32.970 --> 00:26:40.679
Krishna has said: [Hindi talk], when you get
Yoga, when you get Realization, you get your

00:26:40.679 --> 00:26:48.840
well being, your health improves, your mind
improves and last of all you become the giver

00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:55.000
of gifts to others, in the sense wherever
you are, you are auspiciousness.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:04.460
You are so pure that your purity fills the
atmosphere with auspiciousness and this auspiciousness

00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:19.220
when acts, you are amazed how people are helped
and how people are granted these beautiful

00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:21.130
blessings through you.

00:27:21.130 --> 00:27:25.840
And you get aware of it, you understand it.

00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:32.480
That's what we can learn from the lives of
Christ and all other such great personalities

00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:38.399
who came on this earth, how they worked out
things for others and how they granted them

00:27:38.399 --> 00:27:41.529
whatever they desired.

00:27:41.529 --> 00:27:46.809
You become absolutely dynamic as far as the
creativity is concerned, you become great

00:27:46.809 --> 00:27:52.580
creators if your interest is in that, you
become great healers as they call it, but

00:27:52.580 --> 00:28:00.389
not that you heal persons by charging them
money or talking about money, but only being

00:28:00.389 --> 00:28:05.279
in the presence of these people you just heal
them.

00:28:05.279 --> 00:28:12.049
You become the source of all corrections,
but the corrections are not mental that you

00:28:12.049 --> 00:28:15.720
give a lecture to them: "Now you don't do
this any, don't do that any, you shouldn't

00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:16.720
do that."

00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:19.960
Just works out.

00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:29.400
Just people just melt into that compassion
which you are.

00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:33.289
You don't have to fight anyone, you don't
have to struggle.

00:28:33.289 --> 00:28:34.730
It just works out.

00:28:34.730 --> 00:28:36.669
It's so powerful.

00:28:36.669 --> 00:28:45.820
The most powerful power is of love, of pure
love and this purity when emits through you,

00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:50.090
you are amazed that why people have not used
this power of love.

00:28:50.090 --> 00:28:53.550
They have only used the power of hatred.

00:28:53.550 --> 00:29:03.950
All these problems drop out, your family problems,
your city problems, your national problems,

00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:06.450
your world problems all drop out.

00:29:06.450 --> 00:29:16.450
Because all problems come from human beings
who are yet very selfish, very secluded, very

00:29:16.450 --> 00:29:22.460
abnormally attached to limitations.

00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:28.909
The whole thing works out so beautifully and
we have to create such personalities.

00:29:28.909 --> 00:29:34.299
For that God has sent on this Earth great
people.

00:29:34.299 --> 00:29:43.070
I see everywhere, they are very great people,
very special category of people who understand

00:29:43.070 --> 00:29:49.580
that they have to play a role in the working
of the Divine, and they work it out in such

00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:57.539
a manner, that they contribute to the well-being
of the whole Universe.

00:29:57.539 --> 00:30:06.190
America, I must say, has been the least concerned
country about this, I must say.

00:30:06.190 --> 00:30:09.200
Is the poorest as far as evolution is concerned.

00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:12.600
I'm sorry, but has been so.

00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:18.520
They have had all kinds of gurus here, all
kinds of things but in Sahaja Yoga I find

00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:23.020
them, they are not there.

00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:30.080
I'm quite surprised at it, that their interests
are so funny, that they have such limited

00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:35.049
interest in life or what I don't understand.

00:30:35.049 --> 00:30:41.639
I've been to this country many a times, of
course not so much as I've been to other countries

00:30:41.639 --> 00:30:49.110
it was every time I have come, I felt that
they have to still come up to a point to see

00:30:49.110 --> 00:30:54.720
that truth has to be accepted, is to be received.

00:30:54.720 --> 00:31:02.960
Because if the truth is exposed to people
who are not yet ready, maybe it will be all

00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:03.960
lost.

00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:15.390
It's like the story of Christ where He describes
the seeds, which fell on the rock, some fell

00:31:15.390 --> 00:31:18.320
on the right ground.

00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:21.970
This is what it is and I face it up.

00:31:21.970 --> 00:31:31.240
I feel sometimes that such a great country
like India, which is now awakening very nicely

00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:36.019
to Sahaja Yoga, which was just a slave country
for 300 years.

00:31:36.019 --> 00:31:43.950
Or we can say there are countries like Italy,
which are very important but were sort of

00:31:43.950 --> 00:31:50.460
always neglected, treated as something useless,
are coming up, because Spirit is higher than

00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:51.620
anything else.

00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:54.429
Politics, economics is nothing for Spirit.

00:31:54.429 --> 00:31:57.950
Now, let us see what happens in America.

00:31:57.950 --> 00:32:00.669
Let us see what is going to awaken them.

00:32:00.669 --> 00:32:03.980
I don't know what is going to [STIRR] them.

00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:07.080
Because they are also placed in the Vishuddhi
chakra.

00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:11.270
This is the center where America is placed.

00:32:11.270 --> 00:32:14.389
This is the most important center also.

00:32:14.389 --> 00:32:26.500
And if this center is not going to be awakened
then one has to see to it that something happens.

00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:33.420
The Divine might rock and shock and tell you
that better accept to your spiritual life,

00:32:33.420 --> 00:32:34.420
is important.

00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:48.860
Is very important that we should hold the
Divine in our arms and try to accept that.

00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:57.510
People don't realize it, that it is not proper
to live with mundane life, day to day life

00:32:57.510 --> 00:33:06.559
but should think of the wider repercussions
that can have on the people who do not think

00:33:06.559 --> 00:33:15.940
of the calamities that can fall on upon them
if they don't accept the truth.

00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:18.190
Truth must be accepted.

00:33:18.190 --> 00:33:23.670
You see the countries, which have vanished,
like Romans who were such great countries.

00:33:23.670 --> 00:33:25.840
They had a fall.

00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:26.840
Why?

00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:31.880
Because they took to a life which was destructive,
to such a limit that I've heard some people

00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:35.180
saying: "We, we have a right to destroy ourselves."

00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:38.049
You have no right at all.

00:33:38.049 --> 00:33:41.639
You cannot create yourself and you cannot
destroy yourself.

00:33:41.639 --> 00:33:48.899
So one has to realize that if we have any
right that is one to be the Spirit, to be

00:33:48.899 --> 00:33:57.909
that power, which can make others the Spirit,
which can make others the source of joy, what

00:33:57.909 --> 00:33:58.909
they are.

00:33:58.909 --> 00:34:01.100
This is the epitome of our evolution.

00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:09.580
This is the last judgment as I told you and
the Kundalini is going to judge you, Kundalini

00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:11.819
is going to judge you.

00:34:11.819 --> 00:34:17.750
It is not anybody is going to weigh you and
say: "You are such a weight so you are all

00:34:17.750 --> 00:34:21.050
right" or "Your brain has so much weight so
you are all right."

00:34:21.050 --> 00:34:25.660
But the judgment will come to you when your
Kundalini will rise.

00:34:25.660 --> 00:34:28.440
You will judge yourself.

00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:37.250
And you will judge yourself by denying or
accepting the Spirithood, the oneness with

00:34:37.250 --> 00:34:42.210
the Divine, that's a fact, I must declare
it to you.

00:34:42.210 --> 00:34:47.819
Because that is what is very important to
understand and as a Mother I feel very concerned,

00:34:47.819 --> 00:34:56.040
very concerned that such a big population
should not go a waste, just a waste because

00:34:56.040 --> 00:35:07.420
they could not realize the importance of their
being, of their own life, of their own role

00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:11.109
as spiritual beings.

00:35:11.109 --> 00:35:12.609
May God bless you all.

00:35:12.609 --> 00:35:20.089
The lecture can go on because on the Spirit
I must have given at least, I don't know,

00:35:20.089 --> 00:35:24.619
about at least hundred lectures so far, only
on the subject of Spirit.

00:35:24.619 --> 00:35:26.800
So it's an endless job.

00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:31.080
And every time I say something people say:
"Mother you have said something very new."

00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:35.750
So the knowledge is endless but you become
the knowledge, you yourself become the knowledge

00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:37.960
and you start understanding it.

00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:46.800
Only thing is you must have as a duty, respect
for yourself and the importance of responsibility

00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:48.869
that you have to be the Spirit.

00:35:48.869 --> 00:35:54.730
That's why you have come on this earth as
human beings, at this time.

00:35:54.730 --> 00:36:02.099
This time is very precious and it's not a
fashion to be a seeker but it's something

00:36:02.099 --> 00:36:05.510
that has to happen to all of you.

00:36:05.510 --> 00:36:10.200
Yesterday you people asked me many questions
and I think I answered most of them.

00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:19.730
Some of them were very good questions but
some of them were a little very simple I think,

00:36:19.730 --> 00:36:23.480
but nobody was aggressive...

00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:29.930
But on the whole I think that maybe San Diego
is a place from where we may be able to save

00:36:29.930 --> 00:36:32.020
America.

00:36:32.020 --> 00:36:37.160
I didn't have any program anywhere in Los
Angeles or anything, but I came to San Diego.

00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:46.010
But you have to know that if this is the place
we have to get people who are of that quality.

00:36:46.010 --> 00:36:52.119
I don't know when are we going to get them
but I hope we get those people of that quality.

00:36:52.119 --> 00:36:57.190
Even a small nail can hold a sari.

00:36:57.190 --> 00:37:03.440
In the same way a little place looking like
San Diego can save America.

00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:13.560
May God bless you all.

00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:16.420
So we'll have the experience now.

00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:23.000
It will take about five minutes for you because
if all the chakras are discussed already the

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:24.500
attention is on that.

00:37:24.500 --> 00:37:29.710
Is very simple to put your hands towards Me.

00:37:29.710 --> 00:37:34.300
(It's better.

00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:45.770
You've done a good job.)

00:37:45.770 --> 00:37:49.260
Just put your hands towards Me.

00:37:49.260 --> 00:38:04.960
Just like this.

00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:12.810
Left.

00:38:12.810 --> 00:38:23.200
Now, left hand towards Me and right hand towards
the Mother Earth.

00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:24.430
We'll give you a balance.

00:38:24.430 --> 00:38:26.859
You need not close your eyes just now, let's
see.

00:38:26.859 --> 00:38:31.740
Put your right hand towards the Mother Earth.

00:38:31.740 --> 00:38:38.359
As I told you yesterday left side is our conditioning,
conditioning, subconscious and collective

00:38:38.359 --> 00:38:41.450
subconscious, very much at work here.

00:38:41.450 --> 00:38:49.990
But also is an emotional side.

00:38:49.990 --> 00:39:02.280
Now put your right hand towards Me and left
hand towards the sky.

00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:14.950
Right hand towards Me, right hand towards
Me like this.

00:39:14.950 --> 00:39:24.730
Are you feeling the cool breeze in the hand?

00:39:24.730 --> 00:39:39.280
You are already thoughtless, there's no thought,
but just see if you are feeling the cool breeze.

00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:54.350
(Much better.)

00:39:54.350 --> 00:40:09.420
Are you?

00:40:09.420 --> 00:40:24.490
Let's see.

00:40:24.490 --> 00:40:39.550
All right?

00:40:39.550 --> 00:40:56.880
Are you feeling any cool breeze in the hand?

00:40:56.880 --> 00:41:08.089
All right, now put your left hand on top of
your head, just here, fontanel bone area.

00:41:08.089 --> 00:41:11.780
Are you feeling?

00:41:11.780 --> 00:41:13.700
It's a very subtle thing.

00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:16.330
Are you?

00:41:16.330 --> 00:41:18.960
Pay attention.

00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:21.590
(Working out.)

00:41:21.590 --> 00:41:22.900
Good?

00:41:22.900 --> 00:41:25.530
All right.

00:41:25.530 --> 00:41:29.480
Now, change over.

00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:36.940
See the left hand, with the right hand.

00:41:36.940 --> 00:41:42.180
Just pay attention there, see.

00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:44.900
Believe that you are the Spirit.

00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:55.780
So just you have to say in your heart: "I
am the Spirit", in your heart.

00:41:55.780 --> 00:42:03.619
Say it seven times, it will work out.

00:42:03.619 --> 00:42:04.619
Releasing.

00:42:04.619 --> 00:42:08.510
Is it all right?

00:42:08.510 --> 00:42:11.170
Are you feeling the heat coming out?

00:42:11.170 --> 00:42:12.470
Little heat.

00:42:12.470 --> 00:42:21.110
All right, now turn, change, see now.

00:42:21.110 --> 00:42:31.340
Right Swadhishthan.

00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:32.340
All right?

00:42:32.340 --> 00:42:33.340
[UNCLEAR]

00:42:33.340 --> 00:42:41.770
Now, just see, if it is working cool breeze...

00:42:41.770 --> 00:42:46.619
Feel it.

00:42:46.619 --> 00:42:49.579
Just put your hands like this.

00:42:49.579 --> 00:42:54.020
It's good?

00:42:54.020 --> 00:43:02.910
You are all thoughtless.

00:43:02.910 --> 00:43:11.780
If you see, there's no thought in your mind.

00:43:11.780 --> 00:43:15.050
And complete silence.

00:43:15.050 --> 00:43:18.000
Enjoy this.

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:24.360
This moment is going to transform your life,
take it from Me.

00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:35.369
You may not realize today but you'll realize
it very soon.

00:43:35.369 --> 00:43:37.920
Stop.

00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:45.670
Have faith in yourself, that's the main thing.

00:43:45.670 --> 00:43:48.619
It's beautiful.

00:43:48.619 --> 00:43:55.349
Now, all those who are feeling the cool breeze
in the hand or in the head, from the head,

00:43:55.349 --> 00:44:00.930
please raise your hands, all, both the hands
like this.

00:44:00.930 --> 00:44:04.400
Could you believe it?

00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:07.109
Most of you.

00:44:07.109 --> 00:44:09.160
May God bless you.

00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:10.160
Except for one or two.

00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:11.900
Maybe you have come for the first time.

00:44:11.900 --> 00:44:13.310
Have you come for the first time?

00:44:13.310 --> 00:44:17.970
All right, maybe, we'll see you, it's not
difficult.

00:44:17.970 --> 00:44:22.770
Today it's very powerful day, is worked out.

00:44:22.770 --> 00:44:26.790
Now know that you've found it but establish
yourself.

00:44:26.790 --> 00:44:29.119
This is very important is to establish.

00:44:29.119 --> 00:44:30.420
Luckily you have a very good center here.

00:44:30.420 --> 00:44:40.910
And we have to work it out through San Diego,
from this side and from New Jersey from the

00:44:40.910 --> 00:44:41.910
other side.

00:44:41.910 --> 00:44:43.069
We have to work it out.

00:44:43.069 --> 00:44:50.690
All of you must remember that you have got
your Realization.

00:44:50.690 --> 00:44:57.640
I don't want to take any promises from you
because I depend on your Spirit.

00:44:57.640 --> 00:44:58.710
Respect it.

00:44:58.710 --> 00:45:00.730
Respect your Realization.

00:45:00.730 --> 00:45:01.730
Respect yourself.

00:45:01.730 --> 00:45:08.740
Now you will find you have a purpose in life
and just understand how this Divine power

00:45:08.740 --> 00:45:20.800
works and how we can manage it and control
it, how we can maneuver it and how it works

00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:28.280
in the larger interest, in the higher interest,
in the nobler interest, in the righteous life.

00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:33.130
You become that and others also become.

00:45:33.130 --> 00:45:35.020
May God bless you.

00:45:35.020 --> 00:45:46.630
It's a time that clicks and that's why one
should understand why somebody's late, why

00:45:46.630 --> 00:45:47.780
somebody's early.

00:45:47.780 --> 00:45:49.849
All right.

00:45:49.849 --> 00:45:54.720
These two gentlemen and there are some ladies
here who haven't got the Realization so I

00:45:54.720 --> 00:46:10.309
hope the Sahaja Yogis will help them but I'll
come down to shake hands with you.

00:46:10.309 --> 00:46:14.270
Those who haven't got Realization please raise
your hands and don't wear your shoes.

00:46:14.270 --> 00:46:17.410
Just they'll come down and see for yourself.

00:46:17.410 --> 00:46:18.589
Please be seated.

00:46:18.589 --> 00:46:19.610
Just five minutes more.

00:46:19.610 --> 00:46:21.720
Five minutes.

00:46:21.720 --> 00:46:26.160
Don't be in such a great hurry.

00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:28.069
(What she say?)

00:46:28.069 --> 00:46:34.470
I'm sorry, I'm just saying that you wait for
five minutes, I'm coming down and we'll see,

00:46:34.470 --> 00:46:37.740
those who haven't got Realization will get
it.

00:46:37.740 --> 00:46:39.920
Don't be in a hurry.

00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:43.750
What's the time now?

00:46:43.750 --> 00:46:52.360
I better ask because you all seem to be very
much in a hurry.

00:46:52.360 --> 00:46:59.100
For what?

00:46:59.100 --> 00:47:12.450
Do you know I travel all over the world and
I mean you know I don't earn anything out

00:47:12.450 --> 00:47:42.330
of it, as such money wise and tomorrow I go
to New York, then to Switzerland, then to

00:47:42.330 --> 00:47:58.140
Spain, all over the places.

00:47:58.140 --> 00:48:36.490
But how do I do it?

00:48:36.490 --> 00:48:53.109
Because I'm paid in the way what we call is
beyond human awareness: the joy.

00:48:53.109 --> 00:49:00.099
And that's what one has to achieve.

00:49:00.099 --> 00:49:19.660
So don't be 

00:49:19.660 --> 00:49:26.700
in 
a hurry.

00:49:26.700 --> 00:49:52.119
Nothing is going to run away from San Diego,
I can tell you.

00:49:52.119 --> 00:50:02.430
Let's see.

00:50:02.430 --> 00:52:03.039
(They are not so speedy, they are not so speedy
like New York...)
