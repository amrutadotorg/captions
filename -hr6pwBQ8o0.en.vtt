00:06:24.739 --> 00:06:28.756
Today we are here

00:06:32.935 --> 00:06:39.306
to celebrate Sahasrar Day.

00:06:49.208 --> 00:06:57.371
It was not very difficult for Me to open
the Sahasrar

00:06:57.572 --> 00:07:01.338
because there were so many seekers
in this world:

00:07:01.539 --> 00:07:11.521
because, of course, I had studied also
the permutations and combinations

00:07:11.722 --> 00:07:18.920
from which you all are, in a way,
suffering;

00:07:20.327 --> 00:07:24.913
also, the time had come.

00:07:25.119 --> 00:07:32.554
I felt [that] horrible gurus, who are
really devils,

00:07:32.755 --> 00:07:38.821
are trying to capture all the seekers.

00:07:39.022 --> 00:07:46.385
I thought it’s high time that Sahasrara
should be opened out.

00:07:55.328 --> 00:08:01.397
It was not like Christ’s crucifixion
by any chance.

00:08:01.598 --> 00:08:07.569
In those days one had to do lot of tapasya

00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:12.956
and that’s what He went through.

00:08:13.202 --> 00:08:19.841
But in these modern times, what you know

00:08:22.884 --> 00:08:28.628
is much more important than what you do.

00:08:29.702 --> 00:08:37.403
It is such a universal awareness now

00:08:37.604 --> 00:08:42.661
because of maybe, medias, because
of communications,

00:08:42.862 --> 00:08:50.878
because of travelling, that a human mind
knows a lot.

00:08:51.079 --> 00:08:57.094
It knows so much sometimes that its brain
cannot even bear it.

00:08:58.372 --> 00:09:02.064
It is so overloaded with ideas.

00:09:02.265 --> 00:09:08.748
And also the human mind is all the time
anxious

00:09:08.949 --> 00:09:16.762
to grasp, absorb and retain whatever
he thinks is knowledge.

00:09:16.963 --> 00:09:22.045
But he lacks discretion, so all kind
of things are accumulated

00:09:22.246 --> 00:09:25.176
in his brain in the modern times.

00:09:25.377 --> 00:09:38.825
Specially with the advent of all these
media like television, computers.

00:09:39.026 --> 00:09:45.257
Not a media, but it’s quite a complicated
brain again.

00:09:46.011 --> 00:09:50.556
The man had to know the technique of all
these things very much.

00:09:50.757 --> 00:09:59.038
And this technique, if he understood,
he could do many things,

00:09:59.239 --> 00:10:05.170
many more things than your forefathers
could do.

00:10:09.058 --> 00:10:18.346
Thus, materialism started taking its own
development in the minds of people.

00:10:18.547 --> 00:10:24.171
So the curse of human beings, at that time,
was materialism:

00:10:25.848 --> 00:10:31.686
when I felt that Sahasrara must be opened
out.

00:10:32.537 --> 00:10:37.957
Before that, people were just simple,
innocent: they all believed in God,

00:10:38.158 --> 00:10:47.393
they never doubted, and they didn’t even
seek the Truth.

00:10:48.108 --> 00:10:58.913
This materialism created such a competition
among human beings, such hypocrisy,

00:10:59.114 --> 00:11:08.940
that people started finding out that
this is not honest,

00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:18.653
materialism is not joy giving, you can’t
get peace out of materialism.

00:11:18.858 --> 00:11:21.807
Just it started developing into their
awareness

00:11:22.008 --> 00:11:25.562
that this is not the end of our
achievement,

00:11:25.763 --> 00:11:28.938
this is not what we have to know,

00:11:29.154 --> 00:11:35.571
this is not what is going to give us joy
and peace.

00:11:35.772 --> 00:11:43.182
Specially after war, this awareness started
growing very much among young people.

00:11:46.389 --> 00:11:50.273
This is also because,

00:11:50.474 --> 00:11:57.016
now, the human awareness had reached
the state of the brain.

00:11:57.217 --> 00:12:04.753
That’s how they started knowing better,
absorbing better and retaining better.

00:12:06.871 --> 00:12:10.189
You take a little child of today, he knows
much better

00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:15.167
than you would have known when you were
even 25 years of age;

00:12:15.368 --> 00:12:21.064
because he’s supposed to know about
everything.

00:12:23.811 --> 00:12:38.934
And thus, there was no movement towards
knowing what is the Truth.

00:12:39.378 --> 00:12:44.135
But, as this awareness grew more and more,

00:12:44.856 --> 00:12:50.566
lots of seekers were created on this earth.

00:12:51.542 --> 00:12:55.949
So many people, who never knew they were
seekers, suddenly became seekers.

00:12:56.150 --> 00:13:01.751
It’s a atmospheric effect, I should say.

00:13:02.227 --> 00:13:08.059
And thus, a new category of people were
born,

00:13:08.266 --> 00:13:14.747
became aware that they have to find out
the Truth.

00:13:14.948 --> 00:13:24.307
So, it was all simultaneously, according
to the time,

00:13:24.508 --> 00:13:29.836
that Sahasrara was to be opened out.

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:37.081
And thus, this happened.

00:13:37.282 --> 00:13:43.269
For us Sahaja Yogis, of course, Sahasrar
is the biggest event.

00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:49.978
Or we should say – whatever work all
the incarnations have done,

00:13:50.179 --> 00:13:54.402
all the seers and saints and prophets
have done -

00:13:54.603 --> 00:13:58.044
this is the culminating point.

00:13:58.245 --> 00:14:04.821
They did it for individuals, but to do
for masses,

00:14:05.022 --> 00:14:14.272
that it should go to every nook and corner
of this world,

00:14:14.918 --> 00:14:21.170
is the ultimate end of all spiritual growth
all over,

00:14:21.371 --> 00:14:29.454
in every religion, through every great
incarnations and prophets.

00:14:29.655 --> 00:14:35.647
What they indicated about future, what they
talked about,

00:14:35.848 --> 00:14:48.497
what - you are to know yourself, that you
have to find your Self,

00:14:48.698 --> 00:14:51.996
that you have to become a realised soul,

00:14:52.197 --> 00:15:00.168
that you should have Atma Sakshatkar,
that you should be a wali.

00:15:00.369 --> 00:15:05.336
All these indications.

00:15:05.582 --> 00:15:10.128
Even the Buddhists know that Matreya has
to come.

00:15:10.329 --> 00:15:16.105
Ma-treya. “Ma” is Mother. Three times.
Trigunatmika.

00:15:16.306 --> 00:15:23.291
Even the Greeks had Athena with three
powers in Her.

00:15:23.492 --> 00:15:28.332
So, all of them have been predicting about
this time.

00:15:28.533 --> 00:15:36.623
And that time came and that’s how I call it
the blossom time

00:15:36.845 --> 00:15:42.308
and the fruits that are you people.

00:15:42.509 --> 00:15:53.760
So it is all so much, we can say, in
the cosmic cycle of different seasons –

00:15:53.969 --> 00:15:59.144
[that] this beautiful time has come and,
like the wheel of time,

00:15:59.345 --> 00:16:06.156
has to turn and go further - [that] Sahaja
Yoga started.

00:16:06.357 --> 00:16:13.823
Of course, in a very small way, but has
now grown so big all over the world.

00:16:15.291 --> 00:16:22.168
Here now, there’s another thing that has
happened,

00:16:22.369 --> 00:16:33.379
which is rather remarkable, that so far,
people used to meditate alone

00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:37.865
and maybe one of them might get
Realisation,

00:16:38.066 --> 00:16:42.201
but there was no phenomena of en masse
Realisation,

00:16:42.402 --> 00:16:45.989
nor of en masse meditation in those days.

00:16:46.190 --> 00:16:49.679
They all used to disappear into some
nook and corner

00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:53.783
of a quiet place where they would sit down
and meditate.

00:16:53.984 --> 00:17:02.155
But this en masse Realisation, en masse
meditation,

00:17:02.356 --> 00:17:09.186
en masse understanding and learning about
your being

00:17:09.387 --> 00:17:14.219
was not even imagined by Me:

00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:21.303
that it would go to such a limit, to such
an extent, with leaps and bounds.

00:17:21.504 --> 00:17:30.574
This year specially, it has taken a very
new dimension, I think, everywhere

00:17:30.775 --> 00:17:38.402
and all that is negative is being exposed
in most of the countries.

00:17:38.729 --> 00:17:44.754
So this is how, when the Sahasrara opened,

00:17:44.955 --> 00:17:50.748
the Kundalini started moving towards
this Divine Power,

00:17:50.949 --> 00:18:01.699
getting connected with It and was all
the time flowing within you,

00:18:02.025 --> 00:18:05.938
when the Nirvikalpa state came.

00:18:06.306 --> 00:18:12.287
Now when it is coming through
the Sahasrara,

00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:20.323
one has to know that the Sahasrara has
to be clean,

00:18:20.524 --> 00:18:34.587
so that the flow of Divine Power is going,
penetrating,

00:18:34.753 --> 00:18:40.528
without any obstacle, without getting
impure,

00:18:40.729 --> 00:18:47.855
without getting into any kind of problems.

00:18:48.184 --> 00:18:56.924
So, to get to that level, to that state,

00:18:57.125 --> 00:19:02.920
all the Sahaja Yogi, I am happy to know,
are trying to work it out,

00:19:03.121 --> 00:19:13.176
their own individual meditations also, so
that this growth should take place.

00:19:15.071 --> 00:19:22.969
Thus, you get enlightenment in a full way.

00:19:23.170 --> 00:19:28.947
But then one must ask why, for what?
What’s the purpose?

00:19:29.148 --> 00:19:37.443
What’s the aim? The aim is: your aim
is lost.

00:19:38.062 --> 00:19:42.597
You don’t seek for aims at all anymore.

00:19:43.294 --> 00:19:55.419
This pendal was built with such great
ability for which we didn’t pay anything.

00:19:55.620 --> 00:20:01.263
Everybody was working here day and night,
in the rainy season,

00:20:01.464 --> 00:20:06.479
and I was quite worried about them.
I said, “What’s the matter?”

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:10.077
They said, “We are enjoying, Mother. We are
enjoying!” “What are you enjoying?”

00:20:10.278 --> 00:20:14.668
“We’re enjoying the rain.” All right.
“We are enjoying the cold.” All right.

00:20:14.869 --> 00:20:20.581
“Enjoying everything, lifting all these
heavy things, everything we are enjoying.”

00:20:21.369 --> 00:20:25.308
I was quite surprised at them. Nobody had
any complaints,

00:20:25.509 --> 00:20:34.037
but everybody was just on the warpath,
building this tent for you.

00:20:35.558 --> 00:20:39.904
So what happens? Once your Sahasrara
is clean,

00:20:40.105 --> 00:20:46.707
this flow of joy doesn’t allow you even
to think

00:20:46.908 --> 00:20:49.788
that you are exerting or you are working.

00:20:49.989 --> 00:20:56.325
Normally, if you tell somebody that this
is to be erected [they say], “Aaaaaah!”

00:20:56.526 --> 00:21:04.343
Some would faint and some would say,
“Ah, this will take at least one year.”

00:21:04.544 --> 00:21:07.332
Then they’ll start giving excuses.
“This pole is no good.

00:21:07.533 --> 00:21:12.728
That is no good. It won’t stand that.
There’s nothing, there’s nothing”.

00:21:12.929 --> 00:21:18.343
Ultimately, you’ll find nothing is done.
It will lie like this for years together.

00:21:18.514 --> 00:21:23.010
“You better get another person. You better
buy another one.”

00:21:23.211 --> 00:21:27.234
Everything is postponed all the time and
nothing is done.

00:21:27.435 --> 00:21:31.812
But here, you don’t feel you are doing
anything.

00:21:32.947 --> 00:21:36.719
When you don’t feel you are doing anything,
how can you say then, “Why?”

00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:43.043
Because I’m not doing anything, in any way,
so I don’t ask question “Why?” Do I?

00:21:43.244 --> 00:21:47.194
And in any case, I’m not doing anything.

00:21:49.065 --> 00:21:59.811
That is the state where you are working
in the Divine Plan.

00:22:00.012 --> 00:22:08.712
You are doing lot of work, but nobody feels
they are doing anything.

00:22:08.913 --> 00:22:14.339
They all think, we are absolutely just
enjoying ourselves, doing nothing.

00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:20.024
This kind of a state is the blessing
of Sahasrara.

00:22:20.225 --> 00:22:28.073
Because only in your brain you think
all these things, labour-saving devices.

00:22:28.274 --> 00:22:32.301
I mean, you tell anybody, “You go and
telephone to this person.”

00:22:32.502 --> 00:22:36.833
Immediately, if it is a modern one,
he’ll say, “He may not be there.

00:22:37.033 --> 00:22:39.777
God knows. What’s the use? Telephone
may not be all right.”

00:22:39.978 --> 00:22:45.716
“Baba, you see! Why don’t you see
if the telephone is all right or not?”

00:22:45.917 --> 00:22:49.532
Before that only he will give this hundred
and one explanations

00:22:49.733 --> 00:22:54.561
that it may not be all right, it maybe
something may be wrong

00:22:54.762 --> 00:23:02.156
and - just labour-saving, first thing.
That is one of the tricks of the brain.

00:23:02.357 --> 00:23:06.379
Then this intelligence cheats you
all the time.

00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:09.837
It gives you rationality for everything.

00:23:10.038 --> 00:23:13.134
Like a person kills his father and you ask
him, “Why did you kill?”

00:23:13.335 --> 00:23:16.751
“Why not? He was so old. He was suffering

00:23:16.952 --> 00:23:22.362
and I wanted to have all the property,
so I thought better kill him.”

00:23:24.326 --> 00:23:29.098
Like Queen Victoria became very old,
so her son was to think that,

00:23:29.299 --> 00:23:34.526
“I’ll never become a king if this lady
goes on like this!”

00:23:37.935 --> 00:23:42.433
So, the brain starts giving lots
of explanation and cheating –

00:23:42.634 --> 00:23:46.182
because rationality.

00:23:46.563 --> 00:23:54.117
It gives rationality and rationality is
nothing but ego or your conditioning.

00:23:54.318 --> 00:23:58.086
Your ego tells you, “No, this is no good,”

00:23:58.287 --> 00:24:02.213
so you stick on to that point,
“This is not good.”

00:24:02.414 --> 00:24:05.964
Then another can ask you why it is not
good.

00:24:06.165 --> 00:24:09.713
“I think it is not good, so? I think.”

00:24:09.914 --> 00:24:14.133
Or, like some say, “I believe,” but why?

00:24:14.334 --> 00:24:21.293
But in Sahaja Yoga answer is simple,
“Why do you do it?” – “I enjoy it.”

00:24:21.494 --> 00:24:28.533
What’s the next answer? “Why are you
worried? I am enjoying it.”

00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:34.155
Now the people who also say like that,

00:24:34.356 --> 00:24:38.163
because of their conditionings, “Oh,
I am enjoying it.”

00:24:38.364 --> 00:24:40.917
Somebody will say, “I enjoy my drink.”
Somebody can say,

00:24:41.118 --> 00:24:43.427
“I enjoy my going to the church.”

00:24:43.628 --> 00:24:47.935
Sometimes I say going – something else,
you see, like that.

00:24:48.136 --> 00:24:49.743
They are enjoying something,

00:24:49.944 --> 00:24:54.071
which, according to Sahaja Yoga, we too
can never enjoy.

00:24:54.240 --> 00:25:01.342
But that enjoyment is not collective.
That is not supported by anyone.

00:25:01.543 --> 00:25:06.033
For example, somebody says, “I enjoy
drinking.”

00:25:06.234 --> 00:25:12.383
Nobody has erected any temple or any
statue of a man who drinks.

00:25:12.584 --> 00:25:16.713
Have you seen anywhere in the whole world?

00:25:18.550 --> 00:25:29.669
So, though he may say that, “I enjoy,”
it has no sanction from the society.

00:25:30.512 --> 00:25:35.835
People can say, “I enjoy stealing,” people
can say, “I enjoy killing,”

00:25:36.036 --> 00:25:43.368
but it is very arbitrary, it is very
individual and never supported

00:25:43.569 --> 00:25:47.936
by the society, even by the modern society

00:25:49.055 --> 00:25:53.020
and there’s always reaction to it.

00:25:53.664 --> 00:25:58.121
But Sahaja Yoga is not like them. When
you say, “I enjoy,”

00:25:58.322 --> 00:26:03.838
you say it because you have no ego and
you have no conditionings.

00:26:04.039 --> 00:26:09.619
It’s a different situation because now
the Sahasrara is opened out.

00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:12.444
So, on one side your ego has gone down,

00:26:12.645 --> 00:26:19.287
another side your conditioning is finished.

00:26:19.488 --> 00:26:21.543
You are no more conditioned.

00:26:21.744 --> 00:26:28.774
Like you talk to a Catholic… so I started
talking about Christ.

00:26:28.975 --> 00:26:31.380
Immediately he said, “Mother, now, please.”

00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:36.468
I said, “I am talking about Christ,
not about Catholicism.

00:26:36.690 --> 00:26:39.194
Talking of Christ, what are you frightened
about?”

00:26:39.395 --> 00:26:41.490
“Mother, we shouldn’t become Catholic
again, you know.

00:26:41.691 --> 00:26:46.646
That’s why we are worried about.”
Baba, Christ never started Catholicism.

00:26:46.855 --> 00:26:54.819
So much so, they have developed a kind
of a de-conditioning of their minds,

00:26:55.208 --> 00:27:02.214
that they start seeing that whatever these
people have done so far was wrong,

00:27:02.415 --> 00:27:05.431
and that “Whatever I have done so far
was absolutely wrong

00:27:05.632 --> 00:27:11.781
and I’m not going do it.” It’s a very
common thing.

00:27:11.982 --> 00:27:16.487
I have seen the people who have worshipped
Christ prefer to worship Ganesha

00:27:16.688 --> 00:27:19.647
and those who have worshipped Ganesha
prefer to worship Christ.

00:27:19.848 --> 00:27:25.620
Just the same, the name is different,
but just the same, but they like it:

00:27:25.821 --> 00:27:30.382
because [to them] Christ means the priest,
the confessions,

00:27:30.583 --> 00:27:40.368
rosaries and also cemeteries. So they
don’t want to have.

00:27:41.257 --> 00:27:53.270
These conditionings, itself, start showing
their own forms, like devils,

00:27:53.479 --> 00:27:57.861
and Sahaja Yogis want to avoid it, or have
nothing to do with them.

00:27:58.062 --> 00:28:03.883
I remember in the beginning, we had about
six, seven hippies from England

00:28:04.084 --> 00:28:08.317
and they had come to Rahuri. We were
having a program

00:28:08.518 --> 00:28:11.074
and there were five, six real hippies.
These were hippies

00:28:11.275 --> 00:28:14.867
[who] became Sahaja Yogis, real hippies
came to the program.

00:28:15.068 --> 00:28:20.070
I was just sitting like this and suddenly
they said, “Ooooh nooooo!”

00:28:20.271 --> 00:28:23.551
I said, “What has happened?” I started
seeing;

00:28:23.752 --> 00:28:27.369
as if some snake has entered or what
has happened?

00:28:27.570 --> 00:28:35.673
They were hippies, but with this
de-conditioning of the conditions,

00:28:35.874 --> 00:28:43.610
they just couldn’t bear those same hippies –
that they [once] were – coming inside.

00:28:44.643 --> 00:28:52.474
Because you start seeing clearly, very
clearly,

00:28:52.675 --> 00:28:58.172
that all these conditionings had blinded us
completely

00:28:58.373 --> 00:29:04.545
and misled us into a wilderness.

00:29:04.969 --> 00:29:11.597
Of course, about ego, in the West people
are extremely conscious.

00:29:11.798 --> 00:29:15.237
There was a leader’s wife. I said,
“Why don’t you help your husband?”

00:29:15.438 --> 00:29:19.904
She said, “Mother, I’m worried about
my ego.” I said, “Why?”

00:29:20.105 --> 00:29:26.013
“If I start doing some work, this ego might
develop again, so I’m rather worried.”

00:29:26.214 --> 00:29:31.965
They are so conscious of it, that this ego
should not come back.

00:29:32.166 --> 00:29:37.360
One fellow who came to Me and I was
talking to him,

00:29:37.561 --> 00:29:42.082
then he just ran away. I said,
“What happened?”

00:29:42.283 --> 00:29:46.004
So he said, “No, those people who go close
to Mother always develop very bad ego.

00:29:46.205 --> 00:29:53.709
I don’t want to be there close with Her.”
So, it’s a such -

00:29:53.910 --> 00:30:00.762
such a mind that sees madness, that sees
insanity,

00:30:00.963 --> 00:30:04.075
that sees immaturity, it sees vulgarity,

00:30:04.276 --> 00:30:09.890
it sees deceit, hypocrisy, everything
so clearly:

00:30:10.091 --> 00:30:13.616
and in that state, he gets confused
and quite upset,

00:30:13.817 --> 00:30:17.754
wants to run away from everyone.

00:30:19.476 --> 00:30:25.010
Then we have some Sahaja Yogis who have
such problems,

00:30:25.211 --> 00:30:29.271
who come to Sahaja Yoga with problems.

00:30:29.472 --> 00:30:33.534
Then, these people see them with these
problems they are still continuing.

00:30:33.734 --> 00:30:36.531
Now the Sahasrara doesn’t want
to accept it.

00:30:36.732 --> 00:30:40.306
“It’s terrible. I was like him. No, no,
no, no more.

00:30:40.507 --> 00:30:43.412
Me, I don’t want to be that kind.”

00:30:43.613 --> 00:30:51.418
So they abhor the person who was just
like them;

00:30:51.619 --> 00:30:58.083
they just can’t bear him, they just can’t
tolerate him.

00:30:58.284 --> 00:31:03.211
Then I would say still you have to grow.

00:31:03.637 --> 00:31:08.964
You have to grow, your Sahasrara has to be
cleansed out

00:31:09.165 --> 00:31:15.560
at such a speed, at such a level and stage

00:31:15.761 --> 00:31:20.354
that, like soap cleanses everything,
it should cleanse everything else,

00:31:20.555 --> 00:31:27.642
should not be afraid of anything, should
not have any worry

00:31:27.843 --> 00:31:32.300
about the conditionings of others or ego
of others:

00:31:32.501 --> 00:31:35.398
that is the state now we have to reach.

00:31:35.599 --> 00:31:41.760
Today is the Sahasrara Day, is the 23rd
Sahasrara Day

00:31:43.137 --> 00:31:52.256
and I shouldn’t expect much, I don’t want
to say anything much about it:

00:31:52.457 --> 00:31:59.613
but I wish and I hope that all the thousand
petals of your Sahasraras

00:31:59.814 --> 00:32:04.612
will be so cleansed that you will never
catch from anybody;

00:32:04.813 --> 00:32:07.401
you will never be frightened of anybody.

00:32:07.602 --> 00:32:13.826
You will be masters of all kinds
of curatives

00:32:14.027 --> 00:32:26.556
and also you will be the one who can give
solace, peace to others;

00:32:26.757 --> 00:32:31.882
you will be the one who will be organising
programs outside,

00:32:32.083 --> 00:32:38.507
you will be the one who will be
responsible for Sahaja Yoga.

00:32:41.030 --> 00:32:44.830
And when that happens, then we can see

00:32:45.031 --> 00:32:52.505
that these thousand petals of the Sahasrara
have opened out.

00:32:59.863 --> 00:33:10.828
These thousand petals are not yet awakened.

00:33:11.029 --> 00:33:24.808
They signify the different thousand powers
of the Goddess, minimum of minimum.

00:33:25.784 --> 00:33:31.338
These thousand ones you can open out
yourself

00:33:31.539 --> 00:33:40.848
by introspection, by looking at yourself,
making fun of yourself.

00:33:41.049 --> 00:33:47.086
“Know Thyself” means know yourself
with all the defects you have

00:33:47.287 --> 00:33:52.650
and also the potential you have and all
the good points you have.

00:33:52.851 --> 00:33:57.238
So as far as you are concerned, when you
are looking at yourself

00:33:57.439 --> 00:34:01.666
you should just see to the defects that
you have.

00:34:01.897 --> 00:34:08.778
“Why do I behave like this? Why do I
assert so much?

00:34:08.979 --> 00:34:15.869
What’s the problem? Why can’t I see myself
clearly?”

00:34:16.070 --> 00:34:23.028
With that transparency of your Sahasrara,
you can see your heart,

00:34:23.229 --> 00:34:30.589
you can see your mind, you can see yourself
fully, clearly,

00:34:30.790 --> 00:34:34.075
what’s wrong with you.

00:34:34.595 --> 00:34:44.333
This transparency can come only if you
have really

00:34:45.538 --> 00:34:54.384
the pure desire, shuddha iccha, to be
of that level.

00:34:55.046 --> 00:35:04.363
Now, there is no competition between
A and B.

00:35:04.564 --> 00:35:10.442
We don’t say that, “You got the first prize
for coming out of the Sahasrara”

00:35:10.643 --> 00:35:16.390
or we don’t say, “You have the second
prize.”

00:35:17.110 --> 00:35:21.782
There’s nothing like first, second
in Sahaja Yoga,

00:35:23.123 --> 00:35:31.486
because we are not running the race.
There’s no competition between us.

00:35:31.687 --> 00:35:35.813
Whatever we are doing is for our
own satisfaction.

00:35:36.014 --> 00:35:41.173
Now think of something. There are five
people who are running.

00:35:41.374 --> 00:35:46.792
Now they have to think, out of these five
people, who goes first.

00:35:46.993 --> 00:35:53.321
Here it is the other way round: the five
people are meditating;

00:35:53.522 --> 00:36:01.867
now everyone individually has to see for
himself if he satisfies himself or not,

00:36:02.411 --> 00:36:04.725
nobody else is going to give you
a certificate.

00:36:04.926 --> 00:36:10.243
It is you who has to give certificate
to yourself, honestly.

00:36:10.444 --> 00:36:13.746
It’s a very different position.

00:36:13.947 --> 00:36:19.653
It is you, your Sahasrara and your
attention

00:36:19.854 --> 00:36:23.681
and you have to see, within yourself,

00:36:23.882 --> 00:36:30.917
“How far have I realised my own powers,

00:36:31.118 --> 00:36:38.625
my own compassion, my own personality?”

00:36:39.069 --> 00:36:48.429
You’ll have to test it yourself. It is you
are the one who decides.

00:36:48.630 --> 00:36:51.905
When you are the one who is running,

00:36:52.106 --> 00:36:59.148
it is you are the one who decides without
running,

00:36:59.349 --> 00:37:03.842
then what is the question of competition?

00:37:06.115 --> 00:37:14.122
The whole thing disappears into nothing.

00:37:14.923 --> 00:37:19.026
As I told you the other day, an analogy

00:37:19.227 --> 00:37:28.009
that, if you are looking at the mirror,
then you are the one who is observing,

00:37:28.210 --> 00:37:36.952
your reflection is the one that is observed
and there is the action of seeing,

00:37:37.153 --> 00:37:45.501
so you are in three dimensions. But
supposing you become the mirror yourself,

00:37:48.937 --> 00:37:55.450
the whole process is reversed: You see
yourself.

00:37:55.651 --> 00:37:58.595
You don’t have to see because you are
seeing it all the time,

00:37:58.796 --> 00:38:00.953
it’s just spontaneous.

00:38:01.154 --> 00:38:06.374
In the same manner, when it comes
to Sahasrara,

00:38:06.575 --> 00:38:12.852
it is your Sahasrara itself gives you
the full idea as to how you are.

00:38:13.037 --> 00:38:17.436
The diagnosis comes from your own
Sahasrara.

00:38:17.856 --> 00:38:21.481
Your own Sahasrara tells you what centres
are catching

00:38:21.682 --> 00:38:27.466
because all the peethas of these seven
centres are in the Sahasrara.

00:38:27.739 --> 00:38:35.277
As if the Sahasrara is now watching
yourself

00:38:35.478 --> 00:38:38.364
and reporting to you, “See, this is wrong
with you.

00:38:38.565 --> 00:38:41.203
This is wrong with you, this is wrong
with you.”

00:38:41.404 --> 00:38:45.718
So, Sahasrara being the best well-wisher
that you have,

00:38:45.919 --> 00:38:48.636
gives you the right information about
yourself,

00:38:48.837 --> 00:38:52.430
so the best is that you correct yourself.

00:38:52.631 --> 00:39:00.650
So then, achieve that perfect state:
that is what you have to do.

00:39:00.851 --> 00:39:03.287
But once you have achieved the perfect
state,

00:39:03.488 --> 00:39:08.179
you have achieved your aim, you have
no aim left.

00:39:08.544 --> 00:39:14.082
Like the lights now, till you have to make
the lights, you had to work hard,

00:39:14.283 --> 00:39:21.356
make the lights, put them right, do
everything that is necessary.

00:39:21.557 --> 00:39:24.187
But once it is made and the light comes
into it,

00:39:24.388 --> 00:39:34.097
then the job of the light is to give
the light.

00:39:34.298 --> 00:39:38.604
So the first function is over.

00:39:41.055 --> 00:39:47.267
Now the second function is to give it back.

00:39:48.341 --> 00:39:51.882
You reach your aim, your destination.

00:39:52.083 --> 00:39:54.670
For example, I had to come here. All right?

00:39:54.871 --> 00:39:59.974
So I come all the way from My house,
come in the car,

00:40:00.175 --> 00:40:07.721
walking and come and sit down here.
Now it’s finished that part, over.

00:40:07.922 --> 00:40:13.657
Now I don’t have to walk, otherwise
I’ll be all the time running.

00:40:13.858 --> 00:40:19.582
So, all this mad race of this brain stops.

00:40:19.783 --> 00:40:25.256
For what should it be used now?

00:40:25.808 --> 00:40:31.674
For enjoying the peace, for enjoying
the joy,

00:40:31.875 --> 00:40:36.543
for enjoying the collectivity.

00:40:36.931 --> 00:40:42.090
So, the labour or the hard work

00:40:42.291 --> 00:40:46.038
or you can also say the planning
of the future finishes off.

00:40:46.239 --> 00:40:51.198
Only thing now you have got it, so better
enjoy it.

00:40:52.073 --> 00:41:00.977
It’s like you are coming from outside,

00:41:01.178 --> 00:41:04.958
you are running, you are very hungry,
you want to reach home.

00:41:05.159 --> 00:41:09.648
Once you reach home, then the food
is served to you.

00:41:09.849 --> 00:41:12.943
Now what’s your aim?

00:41:13.144 --> 00:41:17.384
Nothing, but to enjoy the food for which
you were running.

00:41:17.585 --> 00:41:21.201
But after that also, if you start running,

00:41:21.408 --> 00:41:27.116
then one should say it is absolute
stupidity.

00:41:27.819 --> 00:41:36.674
But the capacity of enjoyment only comes
when your Sahasrara is absolutely open.

00:41:36.875 --> 00:41:41.981
Otherwise, the capacity to enjoy is much
less

00:41:42.182 --> 00:41:46.666
and you become like a person who is running
all the time

00:41:46.867 --> 00:41:52.886
after something which you never achieve.
There are many like that.

00:41:53.087 --> 00:41:56.937
All their lives they are like mad,
you know.

00:41:57.138 --> 00:42:03.452
They are working morning till evening,
every day, achieving nothing.

00:42:03.653 --> 00:42:08.407
Next day again get up, again running.
All their lives running like this,

00:42:08.608 --> 00:42:14.650
till their foot is in the grave, they are
still running.

00:42:15.493 --> 00:42:23.511
But after getting to Sahaja Yoga, you stop
all these activities

00:42:23.712 --> 00:42:31.116
and leave it to your Sahaja Yoga to work,
to your Sahasrara to work it out.

00:42:31.317 --> 00:42:38.630
And it works out. You don’t have to rush.
You don’t have to be so competent.

00:42:38.831 --> 00:42:42.380
You don’t have to write down everything.
You don’t have to think

00:42:42.581 --> 00:42:49.744
of planning everything. Just everything
works out and it works out beautifully.

00:42:49.945 --> 00:42:56.842
The only thing that one has to do is to
accept whatever is happening for our good.

00:42:57.043 --> 00:43:01.240
Even in small, small things.

00:43:02.225 --> 00:43:07.347
For today’s delay in the puja, is
the desire of some people

00:43:07.548 --> 00:43:10.938
who wanted to give you some sort of a …
I shouldn't say that,

00:43:11.139 --> 00:43:20.449
but some secret show was going to be there
and they didn’t want any light.

00:43:20.650 --> 00:43:24.823
So they were thinking, “What will happen –
the puja will be over by about five,

00:43:25.024 --> 00:43:28.289
then by six o’clock they’ll eat their food,
but the sun would be there

00:43:28.490 --> 00:43:32.417
till nine o’clock, then how can we show
this?”

00:43:32.618 --> 00:43:36.531
All right, so have it in the night.

00:43:36.732 --> 00:43:42.063
In every small thing you will see.

00:43:42.264 --> 00:43:47.175
Some people were coming from India and
they had to bring My two boxes from there

00:43:47.376 --> 00:43:52.881
and they wouldn’t allow these boxes,
they said it is overweight, overweight.

00:43:53.082 --> 00:43:56.076
So they didn’t know what to do. They
thought that they should send them back

00:43:56.277 --> 00:44:02.284
and later on it can go till Guru puja
or somewhere.

00:44:02.485 --> 00:44:07.428
But they thought that there must be some
plan, must be some drama.

00:44:07.629 --> 00:44:14.181
The plane was late [by] 19 hours, so they
thought there must be some drama;

00:44:14.382 --> 00:44:22.448
and then they were put into some sort
of a tourist hotel for that night.

00:44:22.649 --> 00:44:36.690
Next morning, they met two other Indians
from, Sahaja Yogis, from Poona, two boys.

00:44:37.136 --> 00:44:42.826
That settled it! My luggage, they could
put it in their name

00:44:43.027 --> 00:44:49.607
and that’s how the luggage came in.
But they never felt bored: 19 hours.

00:44:49.808 --> 00:44:53.166
“We had nice time, Mother, together.
We were enjoying and talking”,

00:44:53.367 --> 00:44:57.316
finished! Nobody feels that time is passing
out.

00:44:57.517 --> 00:45:06.652
Otherwise, anybody else would have eaten up
all the airport personnel

00:45:06.853 --> 00:45:10.110
and would have broken all the telephones.

00:45:10.311 --> 00:45:13.344
“Waiting for 19 hours, my God, what is
this!”

00:45:13.545 --> 00:45:18.001
Would have given it in the newspapers,
everyone, as this is the greatest crime!

00:45:18.202 --> 00:45:23.160
While these were enjoying life nicely.

00:45:23.510 --> 00:45:29.947
So, we have lost now the sense of aim.
We don’t have any aims.

00:45:30.148 --> 00:45:33.431
We just want to enjoy.

00:45:34.832 --> 00:45:38.537
It’s a very, very big thing that has
happened

00:45:38.738 --> 00:45:47.126
because, as you know, the joy in the
Sahasrara is nira-ananda, nira-ananda.

00:45:47.327 --> 00:45:57.648
Of course, Nira is My name also, but it
means pure absolute joy.

00:45:57.849 --> 00:46:01.131
Nira-ananda.

00:46:02.416 --> 00:46:07.713
And that nirananda, that joy has no other
hues.

00:46:07.914 --> 00:46:12.444
It’s just pure, pure joy.

00:46:13.069 --> 00:46:16.620
Without thinking, it just pours into it.

00:46:16.821 --> 00:46:19.464
After all, every activity is for what?

00:46:19.665 --> 00:46:24.085
For getting some sort of a pleasure,
sensation

00:46:24.286 --> 00:46:28.299
and also, some people believe, for joy.
It’s not.

00:46:28.500 --> 00:46:32.197
Only after the opening of Sahasrara
and the cleansing of it,

00:46:32.398 --> 00:46:36.387
then you will know what is joy. You can’t
explain it,

00:46:36.588 --> 00:46:41.662
how you can spend hours together like this.
People don’t understand, you know.

00:46:41.863 --> 00:46:44.272
Like even our mayor was telling Me that,

00:46:44.473 --> 00:46:47.469
“We can’t sit in the church for more
than fifteen minutes.

00:46:47.670 --> 00:46:52.679
And how people are sitting here for
so many hours?

00:46:52.880 --> 00:46:56.794
Fifteen minutes we cannot sit, but how
these people are sitting

00:46:56.995 --> 00:47:00.803
for such a long time?  What are they
doing there?

00:47:01.004 --> 00:47:05.629
What is their entertainment? How can they
sit for hours together?

00:47:05.830 --> 00:47:09.586
Without saying anything, without dropping
even a pin,

00:47:09.787 --> 00:47:12.557
they are just all the time there.

00:47:12.758 --> 00:47:16.428
So what have you given them? What is
happening to them?”

00:47:16.629 --> 00:47:22.678
This is very surprising and remarkable
that these people,

00:47:22.879 --> 00:47:26.054
who are not even Sahaja Yogis, can see
clearly

00:47:26.255 --> 00:47:31.429
that you people are least bothered, you
are absolutely enjoying life.

00:47:31.630 --> 00:47:36.769
Whatever you may be doing is not important,
what is important is

00:47:36.970 --> 00:47:40.664
that, whether you are working in the office
or outside,

00:47:40.865 --> 00:47:45.476
you are full of joy, enjoying everything.

00:47:45.677 --> 00:47:48.491
This is the most important thing in life,

00:47:48.692 --> 00:47:52.840
which you can have only through Sahaja
Yoga,

00:47:53.041 --> 00:47:59.578
because your Sahasraras are open, because
they are opened out.

00:47:59.779 --> 00:48:04.620
There is now one more thing I have
to tell you,

00:48:04.821 --> 00:48:09.706
that is very important for all of you
to remember:

00:48:09.907 --> 00:48:18.192
that, while living in this Ocean of Joy,
we have to remember

00:48:18.393 --> 00:48:22.533
that there are many who have not yet jumped
into it,

00:48:22.734 --> 00:48:27.940
so we have to bring them in; and it’s such
a pleasure, it’s such a joy

00:48:28.141 --> 00:48:33.484
to give realisation to someone, extremely
joyful.

00:48:33.685 --> 00:48:38.638
So we need people who would come and
say that,

00:48:38.839 --> 00:48:43.965
“We’ll definitely come for this [work].”

00:48:45.262 --> 00:48:50.351
I mean, they should really come forward

00:48:50.552 --> 00:48:57.420
and, once they come forward, you’ll be
amazed how things will work out.

00:48:57.621 --> 00:49:02.691
There are many, I know, who are going
all over, everywhere

00:49:02.892 --> 00:49:05.936
and spreading Sahaja Yoga.

00:49:06.137 --> 00:49:11.327
So is very important for all of you to know
that you have got the light

00:49:11.528 --> 00:49:15.151
to be given to others. Come forward.

00:49:15.352 --> 00:49:19.746
Don’t have fear of your ego, conditionings,
nothing. Come forward.

00:49:19.947 --> 00:49:23.832
You have all the strength, you have
everything within yourself

00:49:24.033 --> 00:49:28.316
and you will do everything with such
happiness and joy.

00:49:28.517 --> 00:49:31.071
Everywhere, in every country people
are doing that,

00:49:31.272 --> 00:49:34.224
but some of them are doing, some of them
are not doing.

00:49:34.425 --> 00:49:40.784
All of you are quite capable of doing it,
so please come forward

00:49:40.985 --> 00:49:45.634
and see for yourself what you are
capable of.

00:49:47.388 --> 00:49:50.609
First of all, you should have faith
in yourself.

00:49:50.810 --> 00:49:54.687
If you have no faith in yourself, you
cannot do anything.

00:49:54.888 --> 00:50:00.985
Have faith. You should have no fears
of any kind.

00:50:01.186 --> 00:50:11.657
And also, to introspect, to see within
yourself what’s going on.

00:50:11.858 --> 00:50:16.156
To be very frank, I find My brain
absolutely empty.

00:50:16.357 --> 00:50:19.855
What I talk from this emptiness, I don’t
know.

00:50:20.056 --> 00:50:24.875
You will also find your brain absolutely
empty,

00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:31.759
and still with that empty brain, you will
be achieving a lot.

00:50:31.960 --> 00:50:36.308
It’s very remarkable, as you have seen that
from the candle you get cool breeze.

00:50:36.517 --> 00:50:40.054
How you can get it from the candle,
cool breeze?

00:50:40.255 --> 00:50:43.531
You do get.

00:50:44.839 --> 00:50:50.396
So, is important to recognise yourself
as a Sahaja Yogi

00:50:50.597 --> 00:50:59.750
and to recognise what have you done
for Sahaja Yoga.

00:51:00.893 --> 00:51:04.962
Without doing for Sahaja Yoga, you cannot
enjoy life.

00:51:05.163 --> 00:51:10.065
That was your aim, and that aim you have
reached.

00:51:10.266 --> 00:51:13.569
Now, if you don’t… supposing I have to come
and sit on this thing

00:51:13.770 --> 00:51:18.837
and I don’t sit on this thing, then what’s
the use of coming here?

00:51:19.851 --> 00:51:23.326
I came here to tell you something about
Sahasrara

00:51:23.527 --> 00:51:26.921
and if I don’t tell you, then what’s
the use of My coming here

00:51:27.122 --> 00:51:30.158
and celebrating Sahasrara Day?

00:51:30.343 --> 00:51:33.782
In the same way, when you have reached
that state now,

00:51:33.983 --> 00:51:36.316
what you have to do is not to use for your
own purpose.

00:51:36.517 --> 00:51:41.151
You have used it, quite a lot, for your
health, wealth, everything.

00:51:41.352 --> 00:51:44.717
Now what are we doing about Sahaja Yoga?

00:51:44.918 --> 00:51:48.168
What have we done for Sahaja Yoga?

00:51:49.096 --> 00:51:51.745
After some time, you will do a lot and
you will never know

00:51:51.946 --> 00:51:55.074
you have done anything for Sahaja Yoga.

00:51:55.275 --> 00:52:02.958
Very surprising, it happens to so many
of you and should happen to all of you.

00:52:03.159 --> 00:52:09.076
I hope all of you will realise that your
Sahasraras are cleaned, completely,

00:52:09.277 --> 00:52:12.208
you are perfectly all right, you don’t have
to worry about it,

00:52:12.409 --> 00:52:20.489
and you can really go ahead with spreading
of Sahaja Yoga.

00:52:20.690 --> 00:52:23.809
May God bless you all.
