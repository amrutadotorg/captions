00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:56.890
So we have decided, we have decided to have
the puja after our dinner because Shri Krishna

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:07.360
was born in the night, about twelve o’clock
while I was born twelve o’clock in the daytime,

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.720
same with Shri Rama.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:24.040
And also Christ was born twelve o’clock
in the night.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:37.520
I’ve told you that today I’m going to
tell you about Gita.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.100
That is the second part of Krishna’s life.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:51.720
So different and varied that some people,
intellectuals as usual, say that the Krishna

00:01:51.720 --> 00:02:05.580
who played as a child in Gokul was different
from the Krishna who was the king of Dwarika.

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:18.780
So when He became the king of Dwarika there
was a war between Pandavas and Kauravas, one

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:27.360
representing the good people, another representing
the bad people.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:36.560
So they came to ask Him if He would join on
their side.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:46.630
So He said, “I’ve got My army and I Myself,
so whichever you choose you can have.”

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:54.840
So Kauravas said, “We’ll have your army,”
but Pandavas said, “We’ll have you.”

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:11.220
And that is how the war started and in the
war His greatest disciple was one of

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.220
the Pandavas called Arjuna.

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.460
And Arjuna asked Him to fight for him.

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:23.650
He said, “I will not take any weapon in
my hand but I will be your charioteer and

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:29.690
drive your chariot.”

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:43.420
And when He was driving the chariot it so
happened that

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.990
Krishna saw Arjuna’s depression.

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:54.350
And Arjuna said, “What is this war?

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:58.400
Why should I fight?

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:07.530
I’m fighting my own gurus, those who have
taught me all the vidyas of the battleship,

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:24.400
battle, and also the vidya of archery and
I’m fighting my own cousins.”

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:32.970
So Shri Krishna said that, “They’re already
killed, they don’t exist, they’re already

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:42.590
dead people, because they’re not realized
souls, I’ve already killed them.

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:51.900
So you have to just play this drama of killing
them.”

00:04:51.900 --> 00:05:00.290
So the foremost contradiction that people
present about Gita is that those who read

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:03.760
Gita should be vegetarian.

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:10.850
Krishna told, Shri Krishna told Arjuna that,
“You kill them.”

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:19.400
Human beings, his own relations, his own cousins
who were bad people.

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.490
What about chickens and goats?

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:35.699
But all those who start reading Gita in India
give up all meat eating and take to vegetarianism,

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:38.770
or they fast.

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:42.340
So how contradictory these things are.

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:45.850
So He never preached vegetarianism, at least
in Gita.

00:05:45.850 --> 00:06:02.210
And He asked Arjuna to kill.

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:09.620
In the modern times there is a war going on
between the evil force and the good.

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:17.150
You don’t have to kill them; even if you
give them bandhan they’re already dead,

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:22.700
they’re not realized souls, they’ll be
all neutralized.

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:29.000
But you have to kill them in the sense you’ve
to kill your connections with them.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:36.240
Like I see many people who come to Sahaja
Yoga, “But my mother is not yet a Sahaja

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:40.750
Yogini, so she troubles me, how can I do Sahaja
Yoga?”

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:45.520
For anything else they’ll fight the mother
but not for this.

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:50.979
“Kill your attachments and your relations.”

00:06:50.979 --> 00:06:58.490
That’s what He said, if in case they are
troubling you in your ascent.

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:07.180
This is the message of Gita to begin with.

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:17.710
But on the contrary I’ve seen there are
people in Sahaja Yoga who once they get married

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:23.300
want to get out of Sahaja Yoga, take out their
husbands or take out their wives or want to

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:32.990
live away and want to be non-collective.

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:34.230
So you have to kill.

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:42.740
There are , there are six enemies
human beings have but in the modern times

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:50.150
they have multiplied, I think.

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:57.500
The first one is the lust.

00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:01.840
Kill your lust.

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:10.699
The lust that is today finishing the West
more than the greed.

00:08:10.699 --> 00:08:16.270
So first is to kill your lust.

00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:25.090
Then kill your anger.

00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:32.020
There are certain people who have a built-in
response that as soon as they see somebody

00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:37.210
they get into anger.

00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:41.459
If a white man sees a black man he gets into
an anger, a black man sees a white man he

00:08:41.459 --> 00:08:43.229
gets into anger, surprising.

00:08:43.229 --> 00:08:52.680
I mean, God has made all kinds of things;
the life would be boring if you all have the

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:57.100
same parched skins, all of you looking the
same.

00:08:57.100 --> 00:09:00.420
So he has made different types of beautiful
people.

00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:08.160
But this anger can come from any source.

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:14.040
This is what it is when you kill anger, actually
you kill all your connections with the past,

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:25.360
the responses, the conditionings you have
had.

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:39.350
Then the vanity that people have; I find it
much more when I go to places where people

00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:52.779
call themselves bureaucrats or they’re “in
charge,” like matrons telling people what

00:09:52.779 --> 00:09:53.939
to do, “Do this, do that, do that.”

00:09:53.939 --> 00:09:58.411
This is the Krishna’s finger, using Krishna’s
finger on others.

00:09:58.411 --> 00:10:10.170
The vanity, the vanity that you are perfect,
you are perfect, “Nothing wrong with me.”

00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:18.269
You are the best people, English think they’re
the best, Germans think they’re the best,

00:10:18.269 --> 00:10:28.440
Italians think they’re the best, or, say,
the best of all are the Switzerland, Swiss

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:30.389
people.

00:10:30.389 --> 00:10:43.199
This vanity, this forge, has to be cut up.

00:10:43.199 --> 00:10:47.899
What have you achieved by being a certain
nation, let us see.

00:10:47.899 --> 00:10:54.180
What have you contributed, belonging to a
certain country.

00:10:54.180 --> 00:11:01.879
Those who only belong to the Kingdom of God
have achieved something.

00:11:01.879 --> 00:11:09.339
The rest of them are useless people, just
finding some way to fight each other, to denounce

00:11:09.339 --> 00:11:15.639
others and vanity is just like a balloon.

00:11:15.639 --> 00:11:24.610
If somebody just puts a pin into it the whole
balloon will collapse.

00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:32.319
Now the worst of all is jealousy, and that
is among Indians, Indians are very big jealous

00:11:32.319 --> 00:11:34.079
pots.

00:11:34.079 --> 00:11:40.050
Specially the Indians who are again in the
government and the politics but otherwise

00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:42.079
also there are jealousies.

00:11:42.079 --> 00:11:46.439
They’ll always complain about the other
people and will be jealous.

00:11:46.439 --> 00:11:56.509
And also in the West people are quite jealous,
I must say.

00:11:56.509 --> 00:12:07.129
They’re jealous of things which is most
surprising.

00:12:07.129 --> 00:12:16.360
One day I was going in the car and one gentleman
was very furious for nothing.

00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:21.629
So the another one tells Me, “They’re
jealous because you’re sitting in a Mercedes

00:12:21.629 --> 00:12:22.629
car.”

00:12:22.629 --> 00:12:26.629
I said, “But it’s not Mine, that’s My
husband’s, you see.”

00:12:26.629 --> 00:12:30.819
What is there to be jealous because I’m
sitting in a Mercedes car.

00:12:30.819 --> 00:12:37.510
I mean, this is being a very stupid, nonsensical
thing but still I can’t believe you can

00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:44.999
be jealous of somebody because he has a Mercedes
car, what does it matter?

00:12:44.999 --> 00:12:53.069
To Me, it’s a foreign idea absolutely, I
can’t understand.

00:12:53.069 --> 00:12:56.790
But there are stupid and stupid things like
that.

00:12:56.790 --> 00:13:15.010
I can only understand one jealousy, that is
between husband and wife, little bit.

00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:34.180
Then the fifth thing that He asked us to kill
is the attachment, very important, “This

00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:36.160
is my child, this is my…”

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:42.790
This is Indian also, more Indian, “This
is my cousin, this is my brother, this is

00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:45.269
my fiancé, this is my wife.”

00:13:45.269 --> 00:13:54.129
Also in the West, the other way round is that
they do not care for their children.

00:13:54.129 --> 00:13:57.610
They do not care for their mothers, they do
not care for their fathers.

00:13:57.610 --> 00:14:06.589
They do not care for anyone whatsoever, but
for themselves.

00:14:06.589 --> 00:14:11.309
That comes from the last one, is called as
the greed.

00:14:11.309 --> 00:14:18.699
Now when you have greed, you don’t care
for anybody, you just want to have everything,

00:14:18.699 --> 00:14:22.199
from another person.

00:14:22.199 --> 00:14:26.929
You want to grab another person of everything.

00:14:26.929 --> 00:14:32.579
Whatever another person has, you want to have
it.

00:14:32.579 --> 00:14:36.369
But when you don’t want to have it everybody
wants to give you it, that’s My case.

00:14:36.369 --> 00:14:43.299
I’m very afraid to say even that, “This
is nice,” because immediately tomorrow I’ll

00:14:43.299 --> 00:14:53.389
find it in My house.

00:14:53.389 --> 00:14:58.649
So this greed is the one which has done such
a harm to the whole world.

00:14:58.649 --> 00:15:04.649
People have gone into great dominations on
other countries, for what?

00:15:04.649 --> 00:15:08.380
For these diamonds and nonsensical things
like that?

00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:13.859
They have ruined their own lives, the progenies
of the progenies they’ve ruined.

00:15:13.859 --> 00:15:21.069
All their cunning they have used to ruin so
many nations just to put them one against

00:15:21.069 --> 00:15:27.160
another, creating problems, doing all kinds
of intrique.

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:28.459
Just for what?

00:15:28.459 --> 00:15:37.660
For greed which is absolutely like cancer,
doesn’t allow anybody else to exist.

00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:42.439
And then you start eating yourself out.

00:15:42.439 --> 00:15:46.529
It’s a disease, I think, greed.

00:15:46.529 --> 00:15:55.089
And with that goes the miserliness; people
become miserly.

00:15:55.089 --> 00:15:57.949
Then where does this greed end up.

00:15:57.949 --> 00:16:05.169
After all the money that accumulates or things
that accumulate in your house, what happens

00:16:05.169 --> 00:16:07.279
to them?

00:16:07.279 --> 00:16:13.589
You want to use them.

00:16:13.589 --> 00:16:17.009
What’s the matter with this one?

00:16:17.009 --> 00:16:24.100
Try to be, not to be, I’ve told, otherwise
I’ll ask you to go out, all right?

00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:25.100
Concentrate.

00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:32.579
So what happens to the people who are greedy?

00:16:32.579 --> 00:16:39.730
They become miserly, they can’t enjoy life,
they cannot spend money because the greatest

00:16:39.730 --> 00:16:44.319
joy is in giving things to others, no doubt
about it.

00:16:44.319 --> 00:16:51.239
And they cannot give any joy to anyone, they
cannot create anything for the future progeny

00:16:51.239 --> 00:16:52.919
to see.

00:16:52.919 --> 00:16:54.419
So what happens to them?

00:16:54.419 --> 00:16:59.689
Their children when they come in they become
wastrel, waste.

00:16:59.689 --> 00:17:08.910
They waste all of them, they lead a wasteful
life, they get into wrong things, and ruin

00:17:08.910 --> 00:17:09.910
themselves.

00:17:09.910 --> 00:17:13.320
So their children who are born become miserly.

00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:16.579
So the vicious circle starts moving.

00:17:16.579 --> 00:17:29.260
He has said, “Kill all of them, these are
your six enemies.”

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:45.540
Now the contradiction, again people use, about
Shri Krishna, in so many other ways that it

00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:55.900
is surprising that not only Christ, not only
Mohamad Sahib, not only Lao Tze, not only

00:17:55.900 --> 00:18:05.410
Shri Rama but even Krishna was misused by
His followers.

00:18:05.410 --> 00:18:15.230
He’s the one who is datast, the one…,
datast means who stands on the banks of the

00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:21.960
attention and sees everything, who watches
everything, he’s the one who is the witness.

00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:31.390
He described, “Sakshi rupena samsthita,”
he becomes a sakshi, a witness.

00:18:31.390 --> 00:18:39.400
That’s what He has said, it’s a play,
it’s a play.

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:45.930
But in the name of Krishna you find all kinds
of absurd things people do.

00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:52.080
They make dramas, they become Krishnas, they
become , they make people…,

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:57.560
befool them, make money out of it or they
sell books on the street.

00:18:57.560 --> 00:19:02.810
Like if you go to Southall you’ll find so
many Westerners wearing funny dresses going

00:19:02.810 --> 00:19:08.190
round asking for alms from Indians and Indians
say, “Oh look at that, these beggars, see

00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:18.600
they have come to get some, let us give them
some money.”

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:32.470
So the contradiction of Krishna’s life is
such a miserable thing, is such a absurd thing

00:19:32.470 --> 00:19:43.920
that it hurts Me to see how such a great incarnation
who was misused in this world by human beings.

00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:49.760
If there was anything lacking in that incarnation,
was this, that He did not give realization

00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:53.610
to people but He did talk about it.

00:19:53.610 --> 00:20:06.330
He said about it, talked of meditation; He
did all that was needed at this stage.

00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:10.910
But what is the result?

00:20:10.910 --> 00:20:13.610
All His incarnation was misused.

00:20:13.610 --> 00:20:22.320
Throughout Gita if you read, you’d be amazed
how people have changed Gita and its writings

00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:23.320
also.

00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:25.400
Same in the Bible and same in the Koran.

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:35.400
Things that they could never have said it,
how could they have said it, you’d be surprised,

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:40.200
impossible, because they cannot contradict
themselves.

00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:51.910
For example, Gita is written by Vyasa who
was an illegitimate child of a fisherwoman.

00:20:51.910 --> 00:21:02.750
But in the Gita it is written that your caste
is determined by your birth; how can it be?

00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:13.400
The one who is the son of…, an illegitimate
son of a fisherwoman, how can he tell like

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:15.090
that?

00:21:15.090 --> 00:21:17.390
See the contradiction.

00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:22.950
Same in the Bible, same in the Koran, same
in the Koran, in all these books, all these

00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:29.600
people have tried to play a very nasty role
by changing it.

00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:33.300
But you can find it out.

00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:39.400
Luckily, whatever they may try, the truth
comes out in this manner and you can prove

00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:44.100
it that whatever you’re saying is wrong,
cannot be.

00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:51.360
The one Vyasa who wrote was the son of a fisherwoman
and how can he say that Brahmins are the highest,

00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:53.440
when he’s not born as a Brahmin.

00:21:53.440 --> 00:22:00.250
And to say that your caste Brahminism comes
from your birth…

00:22:00.250 --> 00:22:05.870
From your rebirth!

00:22:05.870 --> 00:22:17.130
Only they removed little bit – rebirth.

00:22:17.130 --> 00:22:23.610
This is how they interpreted Gita in various
ways in such contradictory manners.

00:22:23.610 --> 00:22:36.460
His whole writings or sayings could not be
changed, of course, they could not change

00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:41.520
it but wherever they wanted to put their own
style, they did it.

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:46.610
Because ultimately, it went into the hands
of the Brahmins who were not really Brahmins,

00:22:46.610 --> 00:22:52.010
they were the people who were sudras because
they were not even realized souls and behaving

00:22:52.010 --> 00:22:55.030
in such a dirty manner; they should not be
called as Brahmins.

00:22:55.030 --> 00:23:00.890
But it went into the hands of so-called Brahmins
and they misinterpreted it.

00:23:00.890 --> 00:23:04.530
Same thing with Bible.

00:23:04.530 --> 00:23:11.490
It went into the hands of horrid people.

00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:18.850
Mr. John said something which was sensible,
all right, but what about the other fellow,

00:23:18.850 --> 00:23:20.040
Paul?

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:28.030
He comes in and spoils everything.

00:23:28.030 --> 00:23:32.230
Then comes Augustine, he spoils everything,
why?

00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:34.580
Because they’re devils.

00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:44.050
There is a evil force; this theory that there
is no evil force is a wrong theory, doesn’t

00:23:44.050 --> 00:23:45.050
exist.

00:23:45.050 --> 00:23:56.120
There is a evil force and don’t play into
the hands of evil force even this much.

00:23:56.120 --> 00:24:05.919
And that was clearly taught by Shri Krishna.

00:24:05.919 --> 00:24:13.440
But even then the contradictions can come
in.

00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:28.690
Like if you are a Krishna bhakta then if you
just start running on the street, “Krishna!

00:24:28.690 --> 00:24:29.690
Krishna!

00:24:29.690 --> 00:24:30.690
Krishna!

00:24:30.690 --> 00:24:42.250
Krishna!” like that, then you are celebrated,
or like a madcap go on, “Krishna!

00:24:42.250 --> 00:24:43.780
Krishna!

00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:48.380
Krishna!” like that.

00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:58.710
Or else being worse than that is some people
said we’re Krishnas.

00:24:58.710 --> 00:25:03.380
Like this horrible Rajneesh did.

00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:07.090
He said He used to make the women naked, so,
“I’m making the women naked.”

00:25:07.090 --> 00:25:11.970
I started wondering, “When did Krishna make
women naked?”

00:25:11.970 --> 00:25:19.990
When He was a little boy less than five years
of age, He used to climb up on the trees and

00:25:19.990 --> 00:25:26.990
the ladies used to take their bath in the
river Yamuna.

00:25:26.990 --> 00:25:33.650
So He used to hide their clothes just to raise
their Kundalini and see how it works.

00:25:33.650 --> 00:25:34.650
At the age of five years what does a child
understand?

00:25:34.650 --> 00:25:45.460
This horrible fellow, was he five years of
age when he was doing this nonsense?

00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:50.940
Using Shri Krishna’s name like this?

00:25:50.940 --> 00:26:00.270
And when he used to break the pitchers of
these gopis, what was He doing?

00:26:00.270 --> 00:26:07.650
He was doing Kundalini awakening, because
the gopis were taking out the water from the

00:26:07.650 --> 00:26:13.170
river Yamuna which was vibrated by Radha and
He used to break them on the back so that

00:26:13.170 --> 00:26:21.290
the water would fall on their Kundalini and
they would get their realization, in this

00:26:21.290 --> 00:26:22.440
lifetime.

00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:27.050
That’s what’s His purification.

00:26:27.050 --> 00:26:35.310
But first thing they will do is to separate
Shri Krishna as a child and Shri Krishna as

00:26:35.310 --> 00:26:40.440
the one who talks to Arjuna, very nice.

00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:45.380
So there is no relevance and use Him the way
you want.

00:26:45.380 --> 00:27:00.270
It’s a very common thing that people start
talking about Shri Krishna as if He’s in

00:27:00.270 --> 00:27:05.380
their pocket, or they are the writers of Gita.

00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:09.820
Like we have in the churches those bishops
and things who drink a lot and then they take

00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:20.900
out their Bible and start reading upside down.

00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:24.900
All these  class whether this
belongs to this or to that, all of them are

00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:34.490
hypocrites of the worst type, just money spinning
people.

00:27:34.490 --> 00:27:40.150
Even Indian temples which are not far-fetched
are ruined.

00:27:40.150 --> 00:27:46.170
All the ganja and all that are sold in Indian
temples.

00:27:46.170 --> 00:27:57.520
All these popes and all these people are doing
something that is never expected.

00:27:57.520 --> 00:28:04.230
Imagine they make a kind of a wine called
Benedictine in your Vatican.

00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:08.450
Can you imagine a nonsensical thing like that?

00:28:08.450 --> 00:28:20.520
Tomorrow they’ll open a beer bar, I won’t
be surprised.

00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:28.210
So we come to a position to understand that
all those people who talk of these great incarnations

00:28:28.210 --> 00:28:33.770
and profess a religion are all hypocrites.

00:28:33.770 --> 00:28:39.180
There’s no religion.

00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:47.350
Simple people who believe these hypocrites
because they’re so simple, so innocent.

00:28:47.350 --> 00:29:03.530
These cunning, greedy devils who started these
religions, exploited these simple people,

00:29:03.530 --> 00:29:10.550
used them for making temples, churches, mosques,
they have no religion within them, how can

00:29:10.550 --> 00:29:13.500
they talk of God?

00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:19.030
Their life is so impure.

00:29:19.030 --> 00:29:31.870
So we have to start our own innate religion,
our own spontaneous, natural religion which

00:29:31.870 --> 00:29:38.160
is the human religion, which is the Vishwa
Nirmala Dharma.

00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:52.150
The one that will give you the inner ascent,
not just talk, no hypocrisy; and all that

00:29:52.150 --> 00:30:05.650
which goes with religion to malign the names
of these great incarnations has to be brought

00:30:05.650 --> 00:30:13.320
to the light for the people to see this nonsense
that has been eating into our societies, eating

00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:18.820
into our families, eating into our children,
has to go away.

00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:33.820
, whenever the religion
– normally doesn’t mean this nonsensical

00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:57.320
religion – falls down, that time, <Sanskrit
expression>, to save the sadhus, the seekers.

00:30:57.320 --> 00:31:05.730
, and to destroy all
these devils, “I take My birth again and

00:31:05.730 --> 00:31:06.730
again.”

00:31:06.730 --> 00:31:11.550
, “Every yuga I take
My birth.”

00:31:11.550 --> 00:31:22.970
And this is what is an incarnation.

00:31:22.970 --> 00:31:34.920
You must be very fortunate people that now
you can see the cunning of all these devils

00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:47.820
and can exist into that purity, into that
benevolence, the hita, which was promised

00:31:47.820 --> 00:31:51.420
by Shri Krishna.

00:31:51.420 --> 00:31:56.450
He never told lies, what He told was the truth.

00:31:56.450 --> 00:32:00.090
He was truth.

00:32:00.090 --> 00:32:12.360
But those who tried to use Him had to take
course to something which was falsehood, hypocrisy

00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:23.490
and cunning but that in no way could stop
the truthful people from getting to reality.

00:32:23.490 --> 00:32:25.190
May God bless you all.
