1
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:07,533
Today I will tell you the importance
of puja.

2
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:14,137
[To the Spanish translator: “You could
take this” (microphone).]

3
00:00:28,306 --> 00:00:39,994
Even among the early Christians,
they used to do the puja

4
00:00:40,195 --> 00:00:52,995
of the adoration to the statues, maybe,

5
00:00:53,196 --> 00:01:03,899
or maybe the photographs, or, we can say,
the stained glass copies

6
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:07,875
of the Mother and Christ.

7
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:28,520
But later on, people started becoming
more rational

8
00:01:28,721 --> 00:01:35,086
and they did not understand what is
the importance of puja.

9
00:01:41,698 --> 00:01:45,678
And when they could not explain it,

10
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:53,638
they gave up doing pujas in that regular
manner.

11
00:02:03,603 --> 00:02:06,802
Even before Christ, they used to have

12
00:02:07,003 --> 00:02:11,386
a particular type of a tabernacle, which
was measured

13
00:02:11,587 --> 00:02:18,577
and was specially made and a puja place
was created to worship –

14
00:02:33,195 --> 00:02:40,338
to worship what they call Yahovah.

15
00:02:45,432 --> 00:02:52,326
Now this Yahovah in our Sahaja Yoga
is Sadashiva,

16
00:02:59,175 --> 00:03:05,150
and Mother Mary is Mahalakshmi.

17
00:03:07,174 --> 00:03:11,903
She incarnated before also.

18
00:03:13,763 --> 00:03:18,521
She incarnated as Sita,

19
00:03:20,032 --> 00:03:26,020
and then She incarnated as Radha,

20
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:31,647
and then She incarnated as Mother Mary.

21
00:03:33,097 --> 00:03:36,935
Now it is clearly written about the birth
of Christ

22
00:03:37,136 --> 00:03:42,261
in a book called Devi Mahatmyam.

23
00:03:50,595 --> 00:03:56,204
He was the son of Radha.

24
00:03:56,718 --> 00:04:02,488
Radha is the Mahalakshmi,

25
00:04:04,798 --> 00:04:14,264
so He was born in another state, as an egg,

26
00:04:17,196 --> 00:04:21,747
and half of the egg remained
as Shri Ganesha

27
00:04:21,948 --> 00:04:31,003
and half of it became Mahavishnu,
which is our Lord Jesus Christ.

28
00:04:40,523 --> 00:04:44,651
All the description about Jesus Christ

29
00:04:44,852 --> 00:04:52,367
is given in that Mahavishnu’s description,
exactly the same.

30
00:05:01,365 --> 00:05:08,881
Now this Mahalakshmi came on this earth
and She brought forth Her child

31
00:05:09,082 --> 00:05:11,494
with immaculate conception,

32
00:05:11,703 --> 00:05:17,788
which She had done before also, as Radha.

33
00:05:33,611 --> 00:05:44,349
So, the Christ is the son of the great
being of the Virat.

34
00:05:50,441 --> 00:05:57,406
Actually Vishnu, Mahavishnu, Vishnu
becomes the Virata.

35
00:06:06,504 --> 00:06:10,573
Now this Vishnu Tattwa becomes Virata

36
00:06:10,774 --> 00:06:16,686
and also He becomes Rama and Krishna

37
00:06:25,131 --> 00:06:29,810
and then the Virat, means the Akbar.

38
00:06:33,544 --> 00:06:45,639
So Christ is the Omkara itself,
is the vibrations itself.

39
00:06:52,124 --> 00:07:01,144
All other incarnations had to take
the principle

40
00:07:01,345 --> 00:07:06,169
or the essence of the Mother Earth
to create their body,

41
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:12,587
except for Christ’s body, which is
absolutely Omkara.

42
00:07:27,444 --> 00:07:34,937
And the earth element of that being
is Shri Ganesha.

43
00:07:41,954 --> 00:07:50,842
So we can say that Christ is the power
of Shri Ganesha which incarnated.

44
00:07:56,921 --> 00:08:04,316
So He – that’s the reason He could walk
on the water.

45
00:08:07,897 --> 00:08:13,746
So He is the purest form of Divinity,

46
00:08:15,437 --> 00:08:20,046
because He is just vibrations.

47
00:08:22,861 --> 00:08:30,685
So when you do puja to Me,

48
00:08:30,886 --> 00:08:37,210
because I’m in person, there is nothing
unreal.

49
00:08:48,246 --> 00:08:51,802
If they had done puja to Christ -

50
00:08:52,003 --> 00:08:59,716
they must, they have done puja to Christ
also when He lived and to His Mother.

51
00:09:06,336 --> 00:09:14,128
It is said that in the Ten Commandments
whatever is created by the heavens

52
00:09:14,329 --> 00:09:23,552
and by the earth should not be re-created
and re-produced and worshipped.

53
00:09:33,111 --> 00:09:39,273
So the incarnations are created
by the heavens.

54
00:09:45,757 --> 00:09:54,503
Only in modern times it is possible to take
a photograph of the incarnation.

55
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:07,922
But in the former days there was
no possibility.

56
00:10:12,183 --> 00:10:17,636
Now whatever is created by the Mother Earth

57
00:10:17,837 --> 00:10:23,088
is what has come out of the Mother Earth,

58
00:10:27,365 --> 00:10:30,867
which is the swayambhu,

59
00:10:31,719 --> 00:10:35,523
is created by the Mother Earth.

60
00:10:36,547 --> 00:10:42,983
Now we have everywhere, we find
the swayambhu things.

61
00:10:48,667 --> 00:10:55,879
Another thing is, some realised souls also
have made beautiful statues.

62
00:11:04,175 --> 00:11:12,744
I went to Portugal and they had a festival
of the Lady of the Rocks.

63
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:23,367
So I went to see that place

64
00:11:23,568 --> 00:11:31,144
and there was a very small little statue
of this dimension, height of the Mary,

65
00:11:31,345 --> 00:11:35,841
about say, five inches, at the most.

66
00:11:42,624 --> 00:11:46,804
And the face was just like Mine,

67
00:11:48,502 --> 00:11:51,912
exactly like Mine.

68
00:11:52,113 --> 00:11:59,142
And they said that this was found suddenly
by two children

69
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:07,931
who were following a rabbit which hid
inside a niche.

70
00:12:19,898 --> 00:12:22,472
So these children saw some light
inside the niche

71
00:12:22,673 --> 00:12:28,452
and they started following under a rock,

72
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:39,963
and they reached the source of the light,
was this statue. They brought it out.

73
00:12:44,146 --> 00:12:45,992
And in that light they walked,

74
00:12:46,193 --> 00:12:49,378
and when the people outside, were lots
of people were gathered,

75
00:12:49,579 --> 00:12:55,552
they were amazed to see that they brought
out the statue from somewhere inside.

76
00:13:08,063 --> 00:13:14,461
So they worship that statue in that place.

77
00:13:18,103 --> 00:13:24,106
Now, these statues give you vibrations,

78
00:13:28,247 --> 00:13:32,065
as I give you vibrations,

79
00:13:32,266 --> 00:13:35,658
but not so much

80
00:13:36,071 --> 00:13:39,226
as I give you.

81
00:13:39,901 --> 00:13:43,444
And all the other statues also, there
may be many,

82
00:13:43,645 --> 00:13:47,584
who might be giving you vibrations.

83
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:55,218
Also in India, as you know, you went
some of you to Ganapatipule,

84
00:13:55,419 --> 00:13:58,975
where it is the Ganesha which has come -
Mahaganesha, that is Christ -

85
00:13:59,176 --> 00:14:03,623
has come out of the Mother Earth,
Mahaganesha.

86
00:14:13,937 --> 00:14:17,132
So the lower portion of the body
you see there,

87
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:22,010
and the head is the whole of the mountain.

88
00:14:30,021 --> 00:14:37,121
And there the water of the sea is
also sweet,

89
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:48,188
and there are many sweet water wells there.

90
00:14:50,653 --> 00:14:53,923
If you remember, a photograph of Mine
was taken there,

91
00:14:54,124 --> 00:14:57,698
many people took photograph.

92
00:15:01,537 --> 00:15:07,764
And in some photographs, in My heart
there’s a light coming out.

93
00:15:09,917 --> 00:15:15,125
And some told Me that some photographs
which did not have the light,

94
00:15:15,326 --> 00:15:25,118
but when they re-took, I mean the negatives
were again taken as a photograph,

95
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:30,922
and again they took a photograph with that,
then the light came in there.

96
00:15:44,354 --> 00:15:49,371
So, one must know that in the realm
of Divine

97
00:15:49,572 --> 00:15:54,536
there are all kinds of miraculous things.

98
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:07,423
Same is the puja.

99
00:16:07,764 --> 00:16:15,121
Now when we do the puja, first of all
you will praise Shri Ganesha.

100
00:16:18,329 --> 00:16:26,531
By that, in you, Shri Ganesha will be
awakened and established.

101
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:39,917
By worshipping Me as Shri Ganesha,
your innocence will be established.

102
00:16:47,975 --> 00:16:50,509
And you will see, the vibration-wise also,

103
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:59,618
your vibrations will increase and you will
feel very stable within yourself.

104
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:15,454
Now when you will take Shri Ganesha’s
names you will know what qualities He has,

105
00:17:19,354 --> 00:17:23,113
what powers He gives you.

106
00:17:23,712 --> 00:17:25,929
When you praise those qualities,

107
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:33,006
those powers of those qualities will
start emitting through you.

108
00:17:43,716 --> 00:17:47,473
This is how the Divine works,

109
00:17:49,256 --> 00:17:54,338
as if you get charged with those qualities.

110
00:17:58,345 --> 00:18:04,649
Then you praise the Goddess, the Adi
Shakti.

111
00:18:08,513 --> 00:18:16,153
Now the Adi Shakti has all the seven
chakras within Her awakened,

112
00:18:21,123 --> 00:18:24,947
and She has to work with all these seven
chakras.

113
00:18:25,148 --> 00:18:30,246
For the first time such an incarnation
has come.

114
00:18:35,295 --> 00:18:37,960
It’s like you make first one room, then
second room,

115
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,519
then third room, seven rooms, and then
the whole house is done,

116
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:46,090
you get the keys and you open, the house
is yours.

117
00:18:59,761 --> 00:19:07,113
That is how I could achieve Self-
realisation en masse.

118
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:21,404
It could not happen earlier,

119
00:19:23,312 --> 00:19:31,146
but now possible, because of this
combination of all the seven chakras.

120
00:19:37,251 --> 00:19:43,103
So now when you are praising the Adi
Shakti, I’m also a Mahamaya,

121
00:19:43,304 --> 00:19:46,265
that I look like you, I behave like you,

122
00:19:46,466 --> 00:19:48,352
I have made Myself exactly like you -

123
00:19:48,553 --> 00:19:52,669
very difficult to make, but I have.

124
00:20:14,019 --> 00:20:18,029
And this body has to bear lots of things

125
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:27,967
to make you understand Sahaja Yoga
and your own powers.

126
00:20:38,744 --> 00:20:42,093
For example, you are - if you are rude
to Me,

127
00:20:42,294 --> 00:20:46,072
if you are not respectful, Christ gets
very angry

128
00:20:46,273 --> 00:20:50,309
because He has said that anything against
Holy Ghost, He won’t tolerate.

129
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:55,837
So the My chakra, the Agnya starts,
you see, throwing anger,

130
00:20:56,038 --> 00:20:59,477
and moving very fast.

131
00:21:12,192 --> 00:21:16,326
Now I have to bear it.

132
00:21:16,527 --> 00:21:21,636
I cannot tell you the way Christ wants
Me to tell you.

133
00:21:28,422 --> 00:21:34,261
Because He is very direct,

134
00:21:36,589 --> 00:21:43,158
and I have to little bit be careful so that
you don’t get upset.

135
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:55,511
Moreover, while doing the puja, supposing
you are a doubting type,

136
00:21:55,712 --> 00:22:03,766
or you are opposing it, then you don’t
absorb the vibrations and I have problems,

137
00:22:17,983 --> 00:22:22,281
because the vibrations are flowing and
you are not receiving it.

138
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:26,988
So I don’t know how to contain within
Myself if you don’t suck in the vibrations,

139
00:22:27,204 --> 00:22:31,639
so I take time to take them out.

140
00:22:47,307 --> 00:22:49,735
So all these things are very symbolic,

141
00:22:49,936 --> 00:22:54,948
whatever we are doing is very symbolic.

142
00:23:00,526 --> 00:23:05,959
And that symbol actually acts.

143
00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:12,235
For example if you give somebody a flower,

144
00:23:12,436 --> 00:23:17,242
 that fellow feels, that person feels
extremely joyous and happy,

145
00:23:17,443 --> 00:23:21,896
and gratitude comes in.

146
00:23:30,277 --> 00:23:35,715
So when you offer Me say, flowers
or anything like water or anything,

147
00:23:35,916 --> 00:23:44,208
then the elements are happy and the deities
are happy in the chakras.

148
00:23:56,613 --> 00:24:01,093
And then they emit their vibrations
of their quality

149
00:24:01,294 --> 00:24:04,306
and of their blessings on you.

150
00:24:04,507 --> 00:24:09,313
They give you their quality and their
blessings.

151
00:24:18,107 --> 00:24:22,144
That is how the Divine acts.

152
00:24:25,371 --> 00:24:34,204
And gradually after puja you will feel it,
that the whole thing is working out.

153
00:24:39,085 --> 00:24:41,552
Now we are doing puja at this time,

154
00:24:41,753 --> 00:24:45,832
and all over the world people know
that there’s a puja going on here,

155
00:24:46,033 --> 00:24:53,376
so they are also sitting in meditation and
they also get the blessings.

156
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:11,878
They are also waiting for this moment
when the puja starts.

157
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:14,773
So we give them a time like eleven
o’clock or so,

158
00:25:14,974 --> 00:25:20,046
up to eleven o’clock we should sit down
and they start at eleven o’clock.

159
00:25:20,247 --> 00:25:23,256
Now they are getting the same blessings,

160
00:25:23,457 --> 00:25:25,203
though you are doing the puja

161
00:25:25,404 --> 00:25:30,183
but they also get the blessings in their
meditation.

162
00:25:48,056 --> 00:25:56,044
If you are not yet so clever and if you
don’t know all the few things

163
00:25:56,245 --> 00:25:59,628
which are important in the puja, does
not matter.

164
00:25:59,829 --> 00:26:04,152
Because if you are ignorant about it,
innocent about it,

165
00:26:04,353 --> 00:26:09,297
God knows, He forgives, He doesn’t mind.

166
00:26:28,146 --> 00:26:31,589
You should not mind if you commit any
mistakes or anything:

167
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:37,382
just with a humble heart, do the way
you like.

168
00:26:46,345 --> 00:26:49,584
Gradually, you will learn.
But if you know

169
00:26:49,785 --> 00:26:55,298
and then you deliberately make mistakes,
then it’s not good.

170
00:27:06,774 --> 00:27:14,246
As we forgive our children, God also
forgives innocent children.

171
00:27:20,204 --> 00:27:24,535
So you should be very relaxed about it.

172
00:27:25,948 --> 00:27:30,589
And just do it for the joy of your heart.

173
00:27:32,622 --> 00:27:35,665
May God bless you all.
