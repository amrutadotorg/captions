00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.600
Happy Easter to all of you!

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:20.930
It's a great day to come to Rome

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:27.180
to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:37.300
Now we have to do the resurrection of Christianity,

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:42.850
which is just moving in the opposite direction

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.760
of Christ's resurrection.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:57.600
As you know that Christ was

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.600
just chaitanya,

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:09.060
but He came in the body

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.510
of chaitanya.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:19.140
The whole body was made of chaitanya,

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:27.060
and He resurrected Himself

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.350
to show to the world

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.100
that you can resurrect yourself also,

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:44.560
if you can fill your body with chaitanya.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:54.300
There is always a struggle between the matter and the spirit.

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.390
In human life what we see

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.140
that matter is all the time trying to take over the spirit.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:11.220
And that is how we fail in our resurrection.

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.260
We fail in our resurrection

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.350
because we give way to matter.

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:26.890
We have come from matter - easy to go back to matter.

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.720
But all the christian nations

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:40.680
have taken to the material development -

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:47.300
identification with the matter, not the sublimation of the matter.

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.100
Why we have gone wrong is

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.560
because matter has become so important to us.

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:06.300
We are so much identified with the matter, with our body,

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.680
with all that is material for us.

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:16.430
People are so much worried about the material things.

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:23.430
What I find that the whole culture has become materialistic

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:29.560
and they're absolutely ashamed about it,

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.350
but still they continue,

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.930
the way it is so shameful and so degrading.

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.850
It degrades human beings.

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:51.640
As I have come in the West I see this trend very clearly.

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.060
For example, in a household

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.680
whatever they purchase is for sale, all the time.

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.720
So whatever they will purchase, they will see to it

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.390
that it should be of a certain standard.

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:11.470
Like it should be,

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.180
if it has to be a diamond, it has to be a perfect diamond,

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.430
because it has to be sold again.

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:22.260
If they purchase the house, they are afraid that

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.060
we should not spoil it or we should not make it beautiful,

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:30.300
we should not try to do something

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:34.260
that will lower the price of the house

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:40.390
because we like the particular type of decoration.

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.760
Everything is for sale.

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:45.850
They never enjoy any matter, you see.

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:47.720
The enjoyment is not there.

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:52.060
Whatever they buy, they think that "can we sell it back?"

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:59.310
Say, even about - I've seen even precious stones.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.010
Like in India, everybody can afford to have precious stones,

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.720
because the rich will buy the most expensive ones,

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:11.010
then the poor people can buy ordinary ones,

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.300
like silver everybody can have,

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:17.310
because some can have silver which is hundred percent,

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:20.100
some can have little mixed up,

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:25.140
some can have with some other material.

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:28.510
But if you go to any country in the West,

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:32.680
it has to have the "hallmark", you see.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.640
The hallmark has to be there. Otherwise they'll never purchase it

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:38.180
unless and until there is a hallmark,

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:44.300
there is a hallmark means, it can be resold.

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.100
Now, supposing in India you buy some...

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.970
everything without hallmarks ... there's no hallmark,

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:55.100
but, when you want to sell it also anytime,

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:56.850
I mean, if you have to sell it,

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:01.390
then you go in the market and they know

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:06.810
what is the intrinsic value of that particular silver

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:08.810
and that's how they pay you.

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:11.350
But we don't have hallmarks.

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:17.600
Now in gold, same thing they do is to have 9 carat gold -

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:20.390
with a hallmark.

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:23.300
What is 9 carat gold? Is not gold at all,

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:26.100
but they'll have a hallmark for that.

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:29.310
And that will be very expensive because you see

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:31.390
they don't have much gold so they put a hallmark

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:33.970
and make it expensive.

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:40.300
The whole economy is that stupidly built towards materialism.

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:45.930
That matter is not for enjoyment but for selling off.

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:50.390
So they do not enjoy anything whatsoever in their lives.

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:55.430
Nowadays I don't know if plastic can be resold or not,

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:59.220
but I have seen people who are even particular about the plastic,

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:04.810
about stainless steel, about anything that they have.

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:08.390
May not be resold but now the, psychologically

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:11.300
they are built in such a manner

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:14.100
that they want to even preserve,

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:17.100
if there's a plastic thing, even there's a thread,

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:22.100
anything, a pin, they would like to preserve it, you see?

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:26.260
Nothing like throwing out anything.

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:32.300
All these things will lead us

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:38.470
into unhappiness, frustration and stupidity.

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:43.560
So now they form an anti-culture.

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:45.720
What is an anti-culture? Is nothing

00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:51.140
but is another form of materialism, which is ugliness.

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:56.390
Like you paint your hair, you become something anti-culture.

00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:01.350
If you wear holey pants, then you are anti-culture.

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:06.300
If you wear dirty clothes, then you are anti-culture.

00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:10.220
But also these are sellable.

00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:13.300
There are markets and markets where you can get

00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:18.100
all dirty clothes, "stone washed" clothes.

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:21.470
All these fashions are coming

00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:25.890
from the two sides or two faces

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:31.600
of materialistic attitude of human beings.

00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:35.760
And they're unashamed sometimes the way they ask for a few things.

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:40.600
Supposing you know somebody has forgotten a spoon with someone;

00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:44.720
so they'll telephone three times, "have you got my spoon with you?

00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:46.430
Have you got my spoon?"

00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:50.300
Unashamed, there's no culture about it.

00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:53.930
While - I don't know - might have been better before -

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:56.300
that what I know about India,

00:08:56.600 --> 00:09:00.760
that even now, in a good family, it is always said

00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:05.300
that "if somebody's pen is with you, be careful and return it back,

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:10.260
but even if your gold is with someone, don't ask,

00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:14.680
it's not done, it's not cultured, it's not sophistication."

00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:18.930
But the whole sophistication has become materialistic,

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:23.600
it's maddening, and that maddens the Western mind.

00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:29.010
For example, if you have to serve, say wines and things,

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:32.100
you have to have different type of cups,

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:36.100
different types of plates, different type of spoons.

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:38.390
You've got spoons for avocado,

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:40.470
you've got spoons for different things -

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:44.930
I mean, you go on like mad, and if that is not with you,

00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:46.260
then they'll laugh at you.

00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:48.010
If they'll come to your house, - "O God!

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:53.430
They served us avocado with ice-cream spoons!"

00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:58.260
That's the greatest sin one can commit.

00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:04.300
So the whole idea of sin becomes so materialistic and nonsensical.

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:07.180
So the resurrection cannot take place

00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:11.060
when the matter is so dead and gone.

00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:14.560
Then this matter enters into the brain.

00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:19.300
When it enters into the brain it rots there.

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:25.430
Then you start discussing about, say, banking

00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:30.680
or about how to economize this.

00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:33.510
I mean the mantra is in London, as I say,

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:37.560
must be everywhere "save pounds".

00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:42.430
As soon as you go to the airport, there is big mantra written

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:48.010
"Save pounds by hiring a taxi at Heathrow".

00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:53.810
Just imagine - they are not even aware of what they are doing.

00:10:54.010 --> 00:10:59.890
All the time save pounds, save money, save this, save ... for what?

00:11:00.890 --> 00:11:03.760
Because they are so frustrated,

00:11:03.970 --> 00:11:08.100
the whole material stuff is so frustrating

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:14.180
that they have to save money to get over that frustration.

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:23.430
And the frustration is counterbalanced

00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:30.300
by drugs or by

00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:34.850
drinking wines and all kinds of nonsensical things,

00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:37.470
and also rotten cheese

00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:42.350
or some sort of a thing that is absolutely a dead matter,

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:46.350
useless thing which makes you dead and sleepy,

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:48.600
so that you run away from reality,

00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:52.640
because you are so frustrated that you want to have something

00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:56.180
that will counteract it.

00:11:56.680 --> 00:12:01.760
Then with that also, when they find, it's not done,

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:06.300
still they are extremely annoyed.

00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:09.810
So what to do next?

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:14.810
If you are that unhappy you have to find out something else.

00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:17.300
As I tell a story about children

00:12:17.510 --> 00:12:20.470
who were naughty and the mother was going out,

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:23.310
so she told that "See, you are naughty children,

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:25.300
so I lock you up in the kitchen"

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:29.390
because anywhere else they can break something, spoil something

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:32.390
and she cannot sell them again, perhaps.

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:34.310
So, she puts them

00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:37.100
in the kitchen thinking, "What can they ruin there?"

00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:42.810
So when she came back, they said, "We ate all your tea leaves!"

00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:45.850
Like that, when they get so frustrated,

00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:50.930
they don't know what to do, so they put nails into their ears,

00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:56.140
pins into their cheeks, something into their nose

00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:59.010
- they don't know what to do with themselves, you see -

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:04.300
so they'll pull out their moustaches or they'll paint their hair,

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:07.680
or do all kinds of funny nonsensical things,

00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:11.300
absolutely frustrated people!

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:13.350
But the worst part,

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:19.060
which cannot be understood is, that so confident about it!

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:24.760
They don't do it with any diffidence, it's complete confidence.

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:29.680
Their attention is all over to see "Now, how we should be?",

00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:33.140
now if they see a tree which has leaves

00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:38.100
which have become absolutely sort of crumpled down

00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:43.100
because of malnourishment, so they want to be like that.

00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:47.180
They want to become people who have malnourishment.

00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:49.890
So they look like miserable people.

00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:55.300
Their cheeks are inside, noses outside - sort of thing goes on -

00:13:55.470 --> 00:14:00.560
and if you see them, they look like sickly people.

00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:04.140
That's the sign of finding out

00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:10.300
some way of expression of their frustration.

00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:19.180
But Christ paved the way - the other way round.

00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:24.300
He said, "Put chaitanya into your matter",

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:29.600
so you'll enjoy that chaitanya.

00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:36.300
Put chaitanya, the vibrations, into the matter.

00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:39.390
This is His message.

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:43.850
He didn't get resurrected only like His spirit going out,

00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:49.100
but the whole His body resurrected Himself.

00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:54.390
So He's talking about

00:14:54.640 --> 00:15:00.470
the resurrection of the body, of the matter, within us.

00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:07.180
In Sahaja Yoga also when we come in, kundalini rises,

00:15:07.510 --> 00:15:12.600
She gives you realization, you do feel the chaitanya

00:15:12.930 --> 00:15:16.640
in your hands, you feel it all around,

00:15:17.010 --> 00:15:21.010
your faces shine like beautiful lotuses,

00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:26.100
your skin improves, you look blooming, everything is fine,

00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:31.810
but still there are material attachments,

00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:36.470
which may be very subtle, could be very gross.

00:15:36.930 --> 00:15:42.510
The gross could be like

00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:47.600
"This is my carpet, this is my car,

00:15:47.930 --> 00:15:55.300
this is my ornament" - something like that.

00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:02.430
But if it comes to

00:16:02.810 --> 00:16:05.760
the style of Christ,

00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:11.390
you have to get identified with the matter which is vibrated,

00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:16.260
which is vibrating,

00:16:18.430 --> 00:16:21.470
which has got vibrating value -

00:16:21.810 --> 00:16:25.640
not material value but vibrating value,

00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:29.640
spiritual value, divine value.

00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:36.760
Could be anything - could be flowers, could be water,

00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:42.930
could be a sari, could be a seat, could be anything

00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:45.970
that becomes valuable.

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:53.680
So attention starts shifting from gross to vibrations.

00:16:57.010 --> 00:17:00.890
But, even now if you have the lurking

00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:06.680
attention into material things,

00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:13.600
then it's difficult for you to rise fast.

00:17:14.930 --> 00:17:19.140
Everything that you use,

00:17:19.430 --> 00:17:23.470
is it helpful for your vibrations or not?

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:29.600
Everything that you do, is it good for your vibrations or not?

00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:34.300
Or is it the same old fashion you are carrying?

00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:39.470
Like the mad people I saw yesterday - they had come for holiday

00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:44.310
and they didn't know how to enjoy,

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:46.300
they were trying everything, you see.

00:17:46.510 --> 00:17:51.100
They must have paid lots of money to their tourism,

00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:54.970
poor things, they must have paid lots of money in the hotels,

00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:58.430
they must have paid lots of money in the restaurant,

00:17:58.810 --> 00:18:01.180
but I felt they were not enjoying at all,

00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:03.600
none of them were enjoying - they were miserable

00:18:03.810 --> 00:18:05.560
and they didn't know what to do.

00:18:05.810 --> 00:18:09.680
And at the end of it I was thinking, that they might just go

00:18:09.970 --> 00:18:15.260
and break their heads with frustration.

00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:20.010
So matter can never give you joy.

00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:23.220
Only the matter that is vibrated,

00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:26.890
that has vibrations, can give you joy.

00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:29.430
A human being can never give you joy,

00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:32.100
may be your wife, may be your children,

00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:35.300
may be your father, mother or anyone,

00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:40.300
unless and until that person is, has got vibrations,

00:18:40.510 --> 00:18:44.100
because joy is the blessings of God.

00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:47.100
And unless and until you have connected with God,

00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:52.300
whatever you may try, whatever you may acquire,

00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:55.890
you can never have that joy.

00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:58.850
You may have that artificial confidence,

00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:01.810
because a person who is frustrated has to say

00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:05.720
- show outside that - "Oh no, I'm not frustrated. I am very happy."

00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:10.260
It's like to be tense and say, "I'm very relaxed" - it's like that.

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:16.260
So, they may just, for keeping up the images,

00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:19.180
might say that "We are very confident",

00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:23.300
but they're very diffident people. They are weak.

00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:29.350
So it could be your children, it could be anyone, any human being.

00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:32.390
Maybe you might think too much of that person,

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:35.560
you may be very much identified with that person,

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:38.100
you may think that this is the greatest thing,

00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:43.010
greatest person you have ever met, it cannot give you joy.

00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:46.560
But an ordinary person, a laborer,

00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:50.760
maybe a beggar, maybe somebody, a Sadhu,

00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:54.760
sitting alone in the forest,

00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:57.510
will be such a joy-giving personality.

00:19:57.810 --> 00:20:03.510
He may speak, may not speak, will be such a precious,

00:20:03.890 --> 00:20:05.850
valuable thing for you,

00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:11.300
than a person who is rich, well placed, highly adored.

00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:17.970
That's where Christianity has failed, coveting with the kings.

00:20:18.850 --> 00:20:23.430
Now this Mr. Pope here, my husband went and saw him

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:26.760
and the Pope was very nice to him because he is, comes from a,

00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:32.810
he's a big man in the material world. He won't see Me!

00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:44.300
Or I may not see him!

00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:56.390
So the whole value system, the whole value system has to change,

00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:01.930
and that value system is

00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:06.680
that you care for nothing else but for your spirit.

00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:09.220
Nothing matters but the spirit.

00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:14.300
The spirit gives you the comfort of a palace.

00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:20.600
It gives you the bliss of all the protection.

00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:29.180
It gives you the joy of all the relationships of the world.

00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:36.300
Then why should you care for something which is no good?

00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:38.220
You can see it so clearly.

00:21:38.390 --> 00:21:44.310
If you have your vision clear, you can see it so much around you,

00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:55.140
that these people look so unhappy, so miserable,

00:21:56.010 --> 00:21:58.470
running after this, running after that.

00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:03.300
Now first they were hippies, then they became punks,

00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:07.100
now they're becoming well-dressed gentlemen.

00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:10.220
Everything is from this to that, to that to this,

00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:14.140
leading them nowhere whatsoever.

00:22:14.310 --> 00:22:19.060
So clearly you see that you are away from them.

00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:23.140
You are in a different realm and you see them.

00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:28.810
So don't go near them.

00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:34.560
Try to show that

00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:37.970
beauty in you, so that they come to you

00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:42.220
and see for yourself, see for themselves,

00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:47.300
that you are resurrected people, you are resurrected.

00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:51.760
Spirit is always there in your heart,

00:22:52.010 --> 00:22:56.640
always there, watching you, seeing you,

00:22:57.060 --> 00:23:02.100
but now because the matter that surrounds the spirit

00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:07.760
is being resurrected, is being vibrated,

00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:13.300
your eyes shine, your skin shines,

00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:19.100
your face shines, you look so beautiful -

00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:21.510
that is what is resurrection.

00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:27.640
In Sahaja Yoga, there's no place for stupid seriousness.

00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:30.310
What are you serious about?

00:23:30.510 --> 00:23:33.300
"Oh, I have to sell my diamond and you know

00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:39.310
they said there's a little black in it."  So what? Wear it!

00:23:42.850 --> 00:23:48.600
All this seriousness comes from the dead matter in your head,

00:23:49.810 --> 00:23:54.390
and you know on the dead grows the fungus,

00:23:54.680 --> 00:24:00.350
and also you know that this fungus gives you all kinds of diseases.

00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:06.010
So keep away from all that is dead.

00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:10.100
Only the chaitanya makes

00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:15.310
the matter vibrate,

00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:18.890
and unless and until you are connected with God,

00:24:19.180 --> 00:24:23.680
you cannot vibrate anything.

00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:28.930
Those great saints, prophets, incarnations who came on this earth

00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:35.140
tried to tell this to all of us, that "get connected with God".

00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:40.010
Everybody said the same thing.

00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:45.300
Of course I have done the job Myself!

00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:48.970
That's good, they're appreciating it.

00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:55.060
And you have to just think about it that

00:24:55.510 --> 00:25:00.260
this connection should not be loose, it should not be disturbed,

00:25:00.430 --> 00:25:05.970
it should not be doubting. Fix it up properly.

00:25:07.010 --> 00:25:10.970
Then you will never lose it for anything whatsoever like

00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:14.760
"My wife is like this, my husband is like this,

00:25:14.970 --> 00:25:17.600
my brother is like this".

00:25:17.930 --> 00:25:22.560
These are the signs of very weak personalities.

00:25:22.890 --> 00:25:25.470
If you are a strong personality,

00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:28.600
with those vibrations if you are strong,

00:25:28.930 --> 00:25:32.510
then you make the other person also stronger

00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:35.510
and bring the other person into Sahaja Yoga

00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:39.140
and give him the nectar of life.

00:25:39.310 --> 00:25:42.510
So today is the message that we have to resurrect

00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:48.600
our matter, within and without.

00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:52.720
So you are raising your kundalini upward, is all right.

00:25:52.930 --> 00:25:57.560
Also you have to spread it - horizontally -

00:25:57.810 --> 00:26:00.600
to your hands, to your feet,

00:26:00.930 --> 00:26:06.430
to your body, to your face, to your thought, to everything.

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:12.600
What is a mantra is nothing but a thought which is vibrated.

00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:16.930
Any thought that is vibrated is a mantra,

00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:22.930
but the vibrations can only be carried by a particular type of,

00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:28.390
or we can say a particular coefficience is needed.

00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:38.060
In dress, in thinking,

00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:43.510
in anything that is worldly,

00:26:43.850 --> 00:26:47.970
there is a kind of a coefficience that works out the vibrations.

00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:52.180
If that coefficience is not there, you cannot catch the vibrations

00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:57.430
and you cannot also give vibrations.

00:26:57.760 --> 00:26:59.560
So there are only two divergences,

00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:03.180
one is the left, another is the right; there are not too many:

00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:05.310
very easy to get rid of them.

00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:12.220
There are only two turns in Italy, one is right or left.

00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:15.300
So in the same way within us

00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:17.930
if you don't go to the left and you don't go to the right,

00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:21.850
you keep in the center,

00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:28.010
you are vibrated! You can vibrate everything!

00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:32.640
But to keep in the center, not to go to any extremes.

00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:35.760
Even in Sahaja Yoga there are people like mad,

00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:37.390
they meditate for twelve hours.

00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:39.890
What is there to meditate for twelve hours?

00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:43.600
I mean you are already in meditation.

00:27:43.930 --> 00:27:47.850
Or else they will make a picnic out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:50.930
One extreme to that.

00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:57.060
What is needed is to think that,

00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:03.430
"I am the spirit and I am connected with God.

00:28:03.810 --> 00:28:09.300
How much am I connected? How much I am sucking in?

00:28:09.470 --> 00:28:13.600
How much I am getting to it?"

00:28:13.890 --> 00:28:15.260
That's all.

00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:18.430
You don't have to do too much about it.

00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:22.100
Those days are gone when people used to break their heads,

00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:26.260
stand on their heads or go to Himalayas.

00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:29.060
But peculiarities in temperament

00:28:29.260 --> 00:28:32.100
is not a sign of a good Sahaja Yogi.

00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:36.010
All the peculiarities come from the matter.

00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:40.180
So a peculiar person in Sahaja Yoga,

00:28:40.350 --> 00:28:45.300
maybe he might be bhootish or he might be egoistical.

00:28:45.470 --> 00:28:48.180
One of the two things in a peculiar person.

00:28:48.350 --> 00:28:50.810
There are no peculiarities in a sahaja yogi.

00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:54.560
There are individualities, but not peculiarities.

00:28:54.810 --> 00:28:59.010
Means everybody will have the nose that he had, it won't change,

00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:00.970
he'll have the eyes which he had,

00:29:01.180 --> 00:29:03.680
but there will be a light in the eye.

00:29:03.970 --> 00:29:07.100
In the same way we can see about our clothes -

00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:09.600
we start wearing sober clothes,

00:29:09.810 --> 00:29:13.140
but not pale clothes or dirty clothes:

00:29:13.310 --> 00:29:16.100
we wear colorful things because we are colorful.

00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:20.220
At Sahasrara there are seven colors.

00:29:20.390 --> 00:29:21.760
Today I wore this color,

00:29:22.010 --> 00:29:24.180
because this is the color of spring in India,

00:29:24.350 --> 00:29:26.220
because all the flowers are yellow

00:29:26.390 --> 00:29:28.560
and there is also mustard which is yellow

00:29:28.810 --> 00:29:33.010
and this is called as a color of the spring.

00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:39.100
In Indian culture, you see, there's a day on this

00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:44.970
that they wear this particular color to celebrate the spring,

00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:51.060
because we're very sort of connected with the nature.

00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:56.100
So today we have received a very nice message

00:29:56.300 --> 00:30:01.890
from New York as if they have dreamt that I'm going to wear

00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:05.350
a color of the spring,

00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:08.510
so I wish somebody could read it out to you

00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:12.100
what they have said, and you will be surprised how it tallies,

00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:15.300
how it tallies with what I'm wearing today -

00:30:15.510 --> 00:30:17.600
and as soon as I wore this sari

00:30:17.850 --> 00:30:20.560
the thing became hot and I knew this would be.

00:30:20.810 --> 00:30:23.810
That is the moment it became hot and I'm sorry for that,

00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:28.390
because you are finding it rather too much.

00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:32.890
So, today is a day to celebrate the spring

00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:35.510
and as you know I was born in spring

00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:40.430
and that Christ was resurrected in spring.

00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:45.390
So the spring starts after the resurrection of Christ.

00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:49.220
In the same way we are now in the spring mood,

00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:52.680
to enjoy, to be happy,

00:30:52.930 --> 00:30:57.180
to be just blissful.

00:30:57.510 --> 00:31:03.470
But not to be frivolous, not to be vulgar, not to be childish.

00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:08.390
That's the way a Sahaja Yogi should be!

00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:14.680
And I'm very happy that at this spontaneous arrangement of Mine

00:31:14.970 --> 00:31:18.310
to come to Rome, so many of you have come.

00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:23.390
It shows how much you love Me and I can't express really

00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:25.720
what I feel about the whole thing,

00:31:25.930 --> 00:31:29.300
except for tears coming to My eyes.

00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:32.720
For whatever Christ has sacrificed His life,

00:31:32.930 --> 00:31:38.560
which was a terrible thing to happen, that He sacrificed His life,

00:31:38.810 --> 00:31:40.810
He suffered so much,

00:31:41.010 --> 00:31:44.510
but the outcome of that is you - all of you here -

00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:48.470
who are resurrected today and your Agnyas are cleared,

00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:51.760
and everything is so very fine.

00:31:51.970 --> 00:31:57.140
May God bless you!
