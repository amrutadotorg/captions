00:05.730 --> 00:51.820
[Music]

00:48.960 --> 00:55.150
so now we are coming to the point of

00:51.820 --> 00:56.950
puja because there are so many new

00:55.150 --> 01:02.440
sahaja Yogi's who I might not have known

00:56.950 --> 01:05.470
what is the puja now as it is now you

01:02.440 --> 01:09.010
all believe that I am Adi Shakti and you

01:05.470 --> 01:11.910
have proof of it puja is one of the way

01:09.010 --> 01:16.030
you can have the proof of it much more

01:11.910 --> 01:19.090
because when you are doing the puja my

01:16.030 --> 01:22.119
deities which are within my chakras they

01:19.090 --> 01:24.910
get excited and they feel happy and they

01:22.119 --> 01:29.320
want to emit more vibrations I mean they

01:24.910 --> 01:32.710
start emitting more vibrations puja is

01:29.320 --> 01:38.020
one of the things by which you can

01:32.710 --> 01:40.960
excite the forms into formless now your

01:38.020 --> 01:45.399
centres are the centres of energies but

01:40.960 --> 01:47.920
they too have a guiding deity sitting on

01:45.399 --> 01:51.670
all these chakras they are also the

01:47.920 --> 01:55.750
formulas made into forms and when you do

01:51.670 --> 01:59.080
the puja reforms melt into formless

01:55.750 --> 02:02.740
energy and this formless energy then

01:59.080 --> 02:06.750
starts flowing and that then blows the

02:02.740 --> 02:09.250
wind and that's how this

02:06.750 --> 02:12.700
misidentification superimpositions

02:09.250 --> 02:16.180
on the spirit are given now you cannot

02:12.700 --> 02:18.550
think about the future the whole thing

02:16.180 --> 02:23.739
happens in a realm which is beyond

02:18.550 --> 02:27.400
thinking so you have to understand that

02:23.739 --> 02:33.819
you cannot rationalize the puja you

02:27.400 --> 02:41.050
should have the maximum advantage on

02:33.819 --> 02:46.390
your chakras for that you must fully

02:41.050 --> 02:50.230
just concentrate on the puja and how the

02:46.390 --> 02:54.160
wind is blowing and the wind will see to

02:50.230 --> 03:02.040
it that they drive out all the clouds

02:54.160 --> 03:07.420
[Music]

03:02.040 --> 03:11.920
so they chewed on a part when they did

03:07.420 --> 03:16.960
supposing the man is doing a filter to a

03:11.920 --> 03:19.660
daily in India they take a great courage

03:16.960 --> 03:21.520
to do puja to a daily you do not know

03:19.660 --> 03:24.700
that substance I think that maybe have

03:21.520 --> 03:28.750
that thing EPA people they were

03:24.700 --> 03:30.550
possessed they can't understand first of

03:28.750 --> 03:33.190
all they have a statue of someone mean

03:30.550 --> 03:36.220
by some horrible fellow then they didn't

03:33.190 --> 03:40.240
do the food out that what is that what

03:36.220 --> 03:43.390
failure everything is good we have got

03:40.240 --> 03:49.170
temples where there are also they can

03:43.390 --> 03:52.840
say flemmings from the mother earth

03:49.170 --> 03:56.370
which are her sheep and should be

03:52.840 --> 04:00.610
alright but no they get reversed why

03:56.370 --> 04:05.920
because most of them these temples are

04:00.610 --> 04:09.010
hounded by or haunted by spirits because

04:05.920 --> 04:10.690
they do all the fancy things there and

04:09.010 --> 04:15.130
when people go hunting the food does

04:10.690 --> 04:23.200
there what happens to them then they get

04:15.130 --> 04:29.260
attacked they become more website but

04:23.200 --> 04:33.100
the puja of only of the goddess is

04:29.260 --> 04:36.100
allowed puja of the God is allowed but

04:33.100 --> 04:39.130
we must know who is the god or who is

04:36.100 --> 04:41.710
the goddess so doing the puja of every

04:39.130 --> 04:43.600
person blindly anybody who comes forward

04:41.710 --> 04:45.190
says this and that should not be

04:43.600 --> 04:48.130
accepted you'd be surprised for the

04:45.190 --> 04:50.400
first four years I said didn't even

04:48.130 --> 04:52.660
allow them to have any pooja worship

04:50.400 --> 04:54.280
even they said you are about guru so I

04:52.660 --> 04:59.260
should allow us to have guru puja I said

04:54.280 --> 05:03.340
nothing I will not then first after four

04:59.260 --> 05:05.200
years on the Nara three day they wanted

05:03.340 --> 05:08.050
to have one puja I said all right you

05:05.200 --> 05:10.420
can have it but very few people and then

05:08.050 --> 05:13.300
they found that that puja

05:10.420 --> 05:18.610
gave them so much of vibration so much

05:13.300 --> 05:22.420
of elated spirituality and they touched

05:18.610 --> 05:24.700
so many dimensions suddenly that then

05:22.420 --> 05:26.470
they started requesting me mother you

05:24.700 --> 05:35.139
must give me a poem

05:26.470 --> 05:50.650
[Music]

05:35.139 --> 05:53.539
it's rather difficult or embarrassing as

05:50.650 --> 05:55.000
a human being for me to tell you what

05:53.539 --> 05:58.430
should be the protocol of the what is

05:55.000 --> 06:02.780
really but I had to tell you because I

05:58.430 --> 06:10.250
don't want you should be harmed but the

06:02.780 --> 06:15.590
protocol must be observed and could be

06:10.250 --> 06:19.180
understood wherever of course it's much

06:15.590 --> 06:27.229
better now first time they had my puja

06:19.180 --> 06:31.669
in Delhi they did my RT with a plastic

06:27.229 --> 06:34.370
plate and the cuckoo was kept in plastic

06:31.669 --> 06:37.159
boxes and I was so much worried about

06:34.370 --> 06:39.020
these people that my whole body has

06:37.159 --> 06:43.760
stunk like this controlling them not

06:39.020 --> 06:46.990
don't do anything if you see my

06:43.760 --> 06:49.580
photograph you see be very different

06:46.990 --> 06:53.720
there was so surprised they didn't know

06:49.580 --> 06:55.760
what to do so don't feel bad for

06:53.720 --> 06:57.740
anything I mean some people feel bad

06:55.760 --> 06:59.210
because they were late for that doesn't

06:57.740 --> 07:01.340
matter that's the time you have to come

06:59.210 --> 07:03.259
some people feel that they could be

07:01.340 --> 07:05.780
something for puja doesn't matter

07:03.259 --> 07:12.560
I never say you didn't bring this you

07:05.780 --> 07:18.320
didn't do that that you saw or you

07:12.560 --> 07:19.610
should not have done this now what was

07:18.320 --> 07:23.720
the need to tell you otherwise there

07:19.610 --> 07:27.620
would have been another big well of your

07:23.720 --> 07:29.210
ex so you guys before you don't know

07:27.620 --> 07:31.550
what Buddha means you don't know

07:29.210 --> 07:36.530
anything of that time how it helps you

07:31.550 --> 07:38.730
so whatever guys done yeah after our

07:36.530 --> 07:43.710
children when they are going there

07:38.730 --> 07:52.900
only my job is to predict and that I'm

07:43.710 --> 07:57.080
[Music]

07:52.900 --> 08:00.400
so a new education is needed for us to

07:57.080 --> 08:06.830
understand its additions of worshipping

08:00.400 --> 08:10.159
it's easy because your mother is always

08:06.830 --> 08:13.060
available you just tell her there is

08:10.159 --> 08:16.220
pooja she dress up and come down here

08:13.060 --> 08:19.580
but in tradition at least there should

08:16.220 --> 08:23.270
be an invitation you have to come and

08:19.580 --> 08:25.099
receive and ask for coming because it's

08:23.270 --> 08:27.110
now you see the joke of the whole thing

08:25.099 --> 08:30.080
is but it's alright because you don't

08:27.110 --> 08:34.760
know it's alright it's not only that I

08:30.080 --> 08:37.339
am saying on the whole ish worship is a

08:34.760 --> 08:40.969
tradition which has come to us from

08:37.339 --> 08:48.529
great seers and ancient sages anybody

08:40.969 --> 08:52.130
even say Moses we can say Socrates you

08:48.529 --> 08:55.640
can say that our air or Markandeya or

08:52.130 --> 09:00.140
any one of these people have found out

08:55.640 --> 09:03.860
the ways and methods how to tune our

09:00.140 --> 09:07.550
instruments to the divine achieve the

09:03.860 --> 09:09.680
maximum job how to place the deities

09:07.550 --> 09:12.290
that's the main point is how to please

09:09.680 --> 09:16.570
the deity but it's a crude word pleases

09:12.290 --> 09:16.570
but how

09:19.059 --> 09:23.649
I don't know what should I say

09:20.709 --> 09:29.409
innovation you say or what do you call

09:23.649 --> 09:33.069
that how to spark them invoke invoke

09:29.409 --> 09:37.989
them invoke them that they give you

09:33.069 --> 09:40.359
complete blessings and the trick of the

09:37.989 --> 09:43.299
trade one has to learn one has to

09:40.359 --> 09:44.120
educate there's nothing wrong in getting

09:43.299 --> 09:52.070
educated

09:44.120 --> 09:55.829
[Music]

09:52.070 --> 09:58.769
all the leaders complain that no one

09:55.829 --> 10:04.880
wants to pay any money whatsoever for

09:58.769 --> 10:08.279
cetera now see actually as you know that

10:04.880 --> 10:12.779
whatever money you give me for

10:08.279 --> 10:17.459
poojas I buy silver fur and you are

10:12.779 --> 10:24.420
given the equal amount of silver as one

10:17.459 --> 10:27.630
would give to Europeans but as far as

10:24.420 --> 10:30.600
the pooja money is concerned it's very

10:27.630 --> 10:33.720
low first I used to just give me $1 of

10:30.600 --> 10:37.170
course that was all in coins which have

10:33.720 --> 10:40.829
brought it back but otherwise whatever

10:37.170 --> 10:44.120
is there is I am not using it for myself

10:40.829 --> 10:47.490
I don't need it I should normally

10:44.120 --> 10:50.430
because it's given to me but I just

10:47.490 --> 10:53.370
thought that instead of that if I give

10:50.430 --> 10:56.730
you silver you will have silver for puja

10:53.370 --> 11:02.459
which is very important and that it will

10:56.730 --> 11:08.760
be very auspicious that is how we

11:02.459 --> 11:11.610
started this proper understanding of the

11:08.760 --> 11:15.120
thing that we have to have a particular

11:11.610 --> 11:17.130
type of metal particular type of styles

11:15.120 --> 11:20.279
now these metals have an effect on us

11:17.130 --> 11:23.010
very much effect on us and in what metal

11:20.279 --> 11:25.709
you do the puja also has an effect it's

11:23.010 --> 11:27.779
all a science of spirituality which one

11:25.709 --> 11:30.810
must understand is very important and

11:27.779 --> 11:32.579
should be done in a proper way if you

11:30.810 --> 11:37.320
have to have the best results it's like

11:32.579 --> 11:39.959
a science and so the puja started and I

11:37.320 --> 11:41.980
think now people have got quite a good

11:39.959 --> 11:49.620
sense of it

11:41.980 --> 11:52.839
[Music]

11:49.620 --> 11:55.769
all the gain that you have from puja is

11:52.839 --> 12:01.180
only possible when you are realized

11:55.769 --> 12:04.560
otherwise it is useless to do any puja

12:01.180 --> 12:07.870
any worship people go to church

12:04.560 --> 12:10.510
seeing few Sims and come back they are

12:07.870 --> 12:12.880
just the same and afterwards go to the

12:10.510 --> 12:17.320
pub so they stink probably the only

12:12.880 --> 12:22.660
place where they can get some job one

12:17.320 --> 12:24.310
had to exert one has to sacrifice though

12:22.660 --> 12:25.570
I may say that sahaja yoga is the

12:24.310 --> 12:27.430
easiest thing you don't have to go to

12:25.570 --> 12:31.980
Himalayas to stand on your heads and all

12:27.430 --> 12:38.200
that but still you have to sacrifice

12:31.980 --> 12:39.940
your time your attention you see I

12:38.200 --> 12:42.070
always tell people unless until they

12:39.940 --> 12:43.510
have perfectly sir Yogi's you know them

12:42.070 --> 12:45.820
they are good please don't bring them

12:43.510 --> 12:48.010
for food but struggles up to me much

12:45.820 --> 12:50.200
more than to them see they also feel

12:48.010 --> 12:52.240
your brush does if see they're obliging

12:50.200 --> 12:53.440
mean they think so VIPRE shipping me I

12:52.240 --> 12:55.360
don't know but they don't know how mad

12:53.440 --> 12:57.850
that troubling my coming yet without

12:55.360 --> 13:00.670
realization the ones who haven't got

12:57.850 --> 13:07.300
realization are really troublesome they

13:00.670 --> 13:11.470
don't help so the myth some people have

13:07.300 --> 13:14.040
that if they come to a puja before

13:11.470 --> 13:17.200
realization they'll get realization is

13:14.040 --> 13:19.899
destructive should not bring anyone who

13:17.200 --> 13:21.760
is not a realized soul or who's not a

13:19.899 --> 13:23.560
sahaja yogi to earth which I struggle

13:21.760 --> 13:26.770
some and that person also starts now

13:23.560 --> 13:30.279
seeing this that all right so from next

13:26.770 --> 13:33.130
time also this is out of compassion I

13:30.279 --> 13:37.690
know we do it out of compassion but this

13:33.130 --> 13:40.690
is not what

13:37.690 --> 13:43.420
then said me not it helps others alright

13:40.690 --> 13:45.730
so from next time also anytime you must

13:43.420 --> 13:47.650
find out a circular say unless and until

13:45.730 --> 13:49.810
you're sure about the realization of a

13:47.650 --> 13:52.000
person that is not realization you

13:49.810 --> 13:54.340
should not call them for the future they

13:52.000 --> 13:56.620
are no good for mother and they are not

13:54.340 --> 14:00.700
good for them because they become mushy

13:56.620 --> 14:02.780
doubting or something you cannot really

14:00.700 --> 14:11.200
give them realization after that student

14:02.780 --> 14:18.160
[Music]

14:11.200 --> 14:20.870
now supposing the person is being Epica

14:18.160 --> 14:24.140
he just goes on mean who doesn't love

14:20.870 --> 14:27.500
from the morning till evening without a

14:24.140 --> 14:29.330
negative energy to look to talented just

14:27.500 --> 14:31.900
come down somebody doesn't refer you

14:29.330 --> 14:37.720
that the vibrations nicely guess for

14:31.900 --> 14:37.720
nothing to be done no not really

14:37.839 --> 14:44.089
so there is no balance so they do a

14:42.020 --> 14:47.420
pooja and they think oh they're done

14:44.089 --> 14:51.950
when you know if you are right-sided

14:47.420 --> 14:54.700
person then enjoy a healthy but not if

14:51.950 --> 14:54.700
you are a left side

14:58.490 --> 15:04.190
huija does hello of course my feet have

15:01.130 --> 15:08.830
been held in both the side sleeper than

15:04.190 --> 15:08.830
and I that left not right not anywhere

15:17.200 --> 15:23.000
that's why in sahaja yoga before the

15:21.140 --> 15:26.380
puja you have to go into a lot of

15:23.000 --> 15:30.170
faculty you have to decorate the hall

15:26.380 --> 15:33.350
you have to get me flowers you have to

15:30.170 --> 15:35.529
organize everything beautifully look at

15:33.350 --> 15:39.230
the roses how beautiful they are

15:35.529 --> 15:42.700
then you starts Paris in yourself with

15:39.230 --> 15:42.700
all these activities you

15:47.300 --> 15:53.270
and then you sit down Fallujah that's

15:50.990 --> 15:58.279
like in the daytime Network the night

15:53.270 --> 16:03.560
rest to rest to get the place you must

15:58.279 --> 16:09.380
get it like we have to climb I'm

16:03.560 --> 16:11.750
Alliance to achieve meditation but

16:09.380 --> 16:15.050
understand your nature supposing you are

16:11.750 --> 16:17.330
a left-sided process mostly Isis

16:15.050 --> 16:21.080
left-sided persons always want to do my

16:17.330 --> 16:25.940
preference and the right-sided persons

16:21.080 --> 16:28.790
are all romances do that early Moscow

16:25.940 --> 16:32.529
University give your social balance and

16:28.790 --> 16:32.529
then into the

16:32.860 --> 16:38.960
[Music]

16:39.880 --> 16:46.760
the thoughtless awareness when you're

16:42.440 --> 16:49.580
doing user completely concentrated in

16:46.760 --> 16:56.720
receiving but while Kuja people are

16:49.580 --> 16:59.480
talking about that's the time something

16:56.720 --> 17:05.290
is oozing out the nectar and you just

16:59.480 --> 17:07.850
receive it at the time with devotion my

17:05.290 --> 17:11.770
vibrations of my chakras at the time was

17:07.850 --> 17:16.220
a lot that even the minut small little

17:11.770 --> 17:23.470
feels in my body come a different speed

17:16.220 --> 17:26.000
a different speed a different dimension

17:23.470 --> 17:29.780
and I really don't know how to explain

17:26.000 --> 17:32.050
but you see creates the melody you have

17:29.780 --> 17:36.950
to receive and it is the melody

17:32.050 --> 17:49.870
individually suitable for every

17:36.950 --> 17:53.030
individual and so at the time of puja

17:49.870 --> 18:02.360
you must know that all your attention

17:53.030 --> 18:06.530
should be in reception so your only work

18:02.360 --> 18:10.970
is or your only method is just to

18:06.530 --> 18:15.710
concentrate on the puja and witness you

18:10.970 --> 18:21.080
are a seer seer has double meaning the

18:15.710 --> 18:24.830
one who sees only just sees and is only

18:21.080 --> 18:27.710
knowledge is a seer without any thought

18:24.830 --> 18:31.640
without any reaction just sees an

18:27.710 --> 18:36.750
observer automatically spontaneously is

18:31.640 --> 18:40.809
the seer for me

18:36.750 --> 18:44.710
sometimes in burdens of because there

18:40.809 --> 18:48.929
should be some parity between you and

18:44.710 --> 18:51.640
the deities some balance must be there

18:48.929 --> 18:54.100
here you are saying all the mantras and

18:51.640 --> 18:57.490
the deities are awakened and there you

18:54.100 --> 19:00.760
are who do not want to receive anything

18:57.490 --> 19:03.190
within your heart so I am the one who

19:00.760 --> 19:07.780
has to store up all the extra energy

19:03.190 --> 19:11.740
that is produced in the body so it will

19:07.780 --> 19:15.460
be better if you all keep your hearts

19:11.740 --> 19:16.820
open and watch the puja without thinking

19:15.460 --> 19:24.669
about it

19:16.820 --> 19:32.659
[Music]

19:24.669 --> 19:36.620
you have got your own petals within

19:32.659 --> 19:40.279
yourself and these ladies are to be

19:36.620 --> 19:44.870
awakened within me natives are the

19:40.279 --> 19:48.080
different aspects of one God so on one

19:44.870 --> 19:51.159
side you have the deities if the aspects

19:48.080 --> 19:55.419
of God which are all the time awakened

19:51.159 --> 19:58.929
on the other side you have your own

19:55.419 --> 20:02.240
deities which are sometimes awakened

19:58.929 --> 20:09.799
sometimes half-awakened sometimes

20:02.240 --> 20:17.269
sleeping and sometimes think so you have

20:09.799 --> 20:25.730
to use two methods one to please

20:17.269 --> 20:30.159
the deity of God and ask them to bless

20:25.730 --> 20:37.090
your debt either or to ask them to

20:30.159 --> 20:43.279
awaken your daily to have the best

20:37.090 --> 20:49.250
effect or the blessings or the best flow

20:43.279 --> 20:52.450
of the grace within us we say - the

20:49.250 --> 20:52.450
sound of mantras

20:56.070 --> 21:07.350
the sound the Sun he comes into the

21:01.670 --> 21:10.110
being of God and there be a code on our

21:07.350 --> 21:14.490
chakras and then the chakras start

21:10.110 --> 21:18.420
opening more so the flow of the grace of

21:14.490 --> 21:21.510
God is received but only a realized soul

21:18.420 --> 21:22.380
should chant a mantra because without

21:21.510 --> 21:26.130
connection

21:22.380 --> 21:29.100
how will it reach God that's why in the

21:26.130 --> 21:32.160
beginning we don't tell them about the

21:29.100 --> 21:37.740
mantra because in the mantras you have

21:32.160 --> 21:41.400
to accept me as detailed in this advent

21:37.740 --> 22:13.590
of mind it is made compulsory that you

21:41.400 --> 22:20.580
have to recognize why have you talked to

22:13.590 --> 22:24.330
Mataji put the method essentially but

22:20.580 --> 22:28.560
the first name of home sister number all

22:24.330 --> 22:30.840
right should I guess she matters when

22:28.560 --> 22:37.890
you are standardizing the thing who has

22:30.840 --> 22:41.570
done this you must ask me because that's

22:37.890 --> 22:41.570
the biggest part is that I am the mother

22:41.990 --> 22:48.630
and that is actually the name driven by

22:45.420 --> 22:51.920
the modern people so it must be accepted

22:48.630 --> 22:51.920
is an additional thing

22:54.169 --> 23:00.929
when you're standardizing the things you

22:56.760 --> 23:10.830
must ask me I love you as anything I

23:00.929 --> 23:12.690
then acceptance over it now I would say

23:10.830 --> 23:15.240
next time when you come to feed us all

23:12.690 --> 23:18.059
of you must have you have written the

23:15.240 --> 23:20.220
names of the verse you must have all the

23:18.059 --> 23:24.149
papers that are there like we have you

23:20.220 --> 23:27.419
moved all of us must have these papers

23:24.149 --> 23:29.250
not only one person should have we

23:27.419 --> 23:31.500
should try to remember certain things I

23:29.250 --> 23:33.809
see the names of the bonus' the leaves

23:31.500 --> 23:35.640
that we decide you should read them a

23:33.809 --> 23:39.750
million I made and understand them the

23:35.640 --> 23:41.640
Sanskrit meaning of it and it should

23:39.750 --> 23:45.590
come to us very easily because that is

23:41.640 --> 23:45.590
how we are going to work our jungles

23:48.130 --> 23:58.570
I have to lay down boobs for you now

23:55.210 --> 24:00.490
because you do not want to meet them I'm

23:58.570 --> 24:02.950
also amazed that many people do not know

24:00.490 --> 24:07.150
even my arty after so many years by

24:02.950 --> 24:10.049
heart that is what sahaja why is because

24:07.150 --> 24:10.049
it's a Mahamaya

24:10.270 --> 24:16.930
so you have to learn it yourself you

24:14.470 --> 24:20.290
have to get yourself

24:16.930 --> 24:21.610
now when you do that the old so somebody

24:20.290 --> 24:24.250
is shouting at the top of his voice

24:21.610 --> 24:25.990
she's trying to lead others then another

24:24.250 --> 24:27.850
trying to lead others this should not be

24:25.990 --> 24:31.630
there should be some homogenous I can

24:27.850 --> 24:37.870
make it up there's no random singing the

24:31.630 --> 24:40.860
same don't same style try to make it 1-1

24:37.870 --> 24:40.860
good God

24:41.250 --> 24:46.360
in a humble way in joyous way that we

24:44.230 --> 24:49.570
all are singing all our hearts are

24:46.360 --> 24:51.940
singing all of us are here to do it so

24:49.570 --> 24:57.600
many of us I feel that joy we are so

24:51.940 --> 25:02.440
many some of you might feel that by

24:57.600 --> 25:06.510
knowing some of the parties and things

25:02.440 --> 25:10.300
by heart you will achieve weight is not

25:06.510 --> 25:13.480
also because that is also just words but

25:10.300 --> 25:16.630
if that is an awakened thing within you

25:13.480 --> 25:20.470
then they become a month and then you

25:16.630 --> 25:24.670
can work it out but first of all you

25:20.470 --> 25:28.929
must achieve a certain standard to have

25:24.670 --> 25:33.000
that power to create momentum also when

25:28.929 --> 25:36.400
you say Samar P it's not necessarily

25:33.000 --> 25:39.580
possible that it will work out let us

25:36.400 --> 25:43.450
face the things as they are and not to

25:39.580 --> 25:47.620
be conditioned by anything you have to

25:43.450 --> 25:56.170
achieve a certain depth within yourself

25:47.620 --> 25:58.540
to even enlighten the amantha first of

25:56.170 --> 26:01.420
all you should have clear-cut vibrations

25:58.540 --> 26:06.280
minimum of meaning if you have certain

26:01.420 --> 26:09.640
chakras caching then try going through

26:06.280 --> 26:11.350
your chakras with the photograph with

26:09.640 --> 26:13.780
all due respect to the photograph it's

26:11.350 --> 26:18.500
only the photograph which is going to

26:13.780 --> 26:26.030
work it out nothing else what if I

26:18.500 --> 26:31.260
[Music]

26:26.030 --> 26:34.260
so these puja methods and prayer methods

26:31.260 --> 26:37.770
and human promethazine have been devised

26:34.260 --> 26:41.250
and found out by great thinkers of

26:37.770 --> 26:47.400
sahaja yoga the great masters of sahaja

26:41.250 --> 26:53.960
yoga and it is the effort or you can say

26:47.400 --> 27:01.860
the effortless effort of Raja yoga that

26:53.960 --> 27:05.490
makes my body vibrant extract from my

27:01.860 --> 27:08.160
body I should say they make it makes the

27:05.490 --> 27:12.720
infinite release itself through the

27:08.160 --> 27:15.450
Trinity and it works it clicks have seen

27:12.720 --> 27:20.760
it works very well but you know that

27:15.450 --> 27:22.770
after pooja I get little time because if

27:20.760 --> 27:27.840
you cannot receive that force

27:22.770 --> 27:33.720
I want to the creep and get rid of that

27:27.840 --> 27:39.660
additional vibration into simply by

27:33.720 --> 27:41.720
entering into the infinite state if you

27:39.660 --> 27:48.690
could receive whatever I have everything

27:41.720 --> 27:51.410
in balance with your puja then only it

27:48.690 --> 27:51.410
helps better

27:53.070 --> 28:00.580
when they start emitting more vibrations

27:56.760 --> 28:03.190
then you are surprised that how after

28:00.580 --> 28:05.110
puja you get so drenched and it just

28:03.190 --> 28:09.910
feel elevated and at a much higher level

28:05.110 --> 28:11.770
of course it is true that during the

28:09.910 --> 28:13.660
puja time you feel very much elevated

28:11.770 --> 28:16.540
for some time you can give it up some

28:13.660 --> 28:19.300
people definitely retain it but some

28:16.540 --> 28:24.120
people go up and down like a yo-yo they

28:19.300 --> 28:30.210
don't have that capacity to retain it

28:24.120 --> 28:33.370
now they must meditate also after food

28:30.210 --> 28:38.320
because my vibrations you do not suck in

28:33.370 --> 28:42.880
without meditation as always it happens

28:38.320 --> 28:46.270
so far I had very few he does it which

28:42.880 --> 28:48.280
my whole vibrations were sucked if you

28:46.270 --> 28:50.380
have sincerity about it really the

28:48.280 --> 28:55.630
sincerity part of it will suck all my

28:50.380 --> 28:59.710
relations tell your mind not to ask

28:55.630 --> 29:05.070
questions and to misbehave but to suck

28:59.710 --> 29:10.090
the vibrations yeah this is for your own

29:05.070 --> 29:13.440
nourishment for your own growth for your

29:10.090 --> 29:13.440
own angel

29:14.550 --> 29:21.010
the Poudre has its effect on everyone

29:19.180 --> 29:23.020
but according to our your depth and

29:21.010 --> 29:25.300
that's for that you have to have studied

29:23.020 --> 29:29.170
our field if your mind is still thinking

29:25.300 --> 29:31.330
you cannot achieve much input while for

29:29.170 --> 29:34.030
Indians to attend a puja is the highest

29:31.330 --> 29:35.500
they don't mind my lecture that anything

29:34.030 --> 29:39.100
if they miss the program doesn't matter

29:35.500 --> 29:40.810
any music program is alright any kind of

29:39.100 --> 29:42.460
discomfort is alright as long as they

29:40.810 --> 29:45.310
can attend to do that today people have

29:42.460 --> 29:49.450
come from 200 to 300 miles for this

29:45.310 --> 29:52.870
portion all the way because they know

29:49.450 --> 29:54.860
this is the knowledge of the roots for

29:52.870 --> 30:00.100
that you have to do the food

29:54.860 --> 30:05.620
[Music]

30:00.100 --> 30:10.120
I have seen many women specially in

30:05.620 --> 30:13.360
sahaja yoga there are sahaja Yogi's

30:10.120 --> 30:18.220
their vibrations all that is there but

30:13.360 --> 30:23.050
they they do not know what is such they

30:18.220 --> 30:25.930
do not know what these chakras are they

30:23.050 --> 30:29.340
do not know that how these vibrations

30:25.930 --> 30:32.740
were now today's lecture is quite a

30:29.340 --> 30:34.990
lecture cut complicated I would say if

30:32.740 --> 30:36.820
you see to it will have to listen to it

30:34.990 --> 30:38.620
at least four or five times to

30:36.820 --> 30:41.080
understand it with a paper and a pen see

30:38.620 --> 30:42.520
it's not an easy thing because I am

30:41.080 --> 30:44.200
telling you now it's alright it is quite

30:42.520 --> 30:47.700
entertaining but behind the

30:44.200 --> 30:51.040
entertainment there is a deep knowledge

30:47.700 --> 30:53.560
so I have not seen the sahaja yoginis

30:51.040 --> 30:59.050
mostly sit down with a paper and pencil

30:53.560 --> 31:01.480
to know what is mother saying what is

30:59.050 --> 31:05.850
the knowledge is giving us about the

31:01.480 --> 31:05.850
various things to them sorry oka means

31:06.270 --> 31:14.440
to be nice to cook good food and help

31:10.000 --> 31:17.320
the sahaja Yogi's and that of course for

31:14.440 --> 31:19.960
the puja is to wear nice saris and nice

31:17.320 --> 31:25.150
dresses come to the puja and all that

31:19.960 --> 31:27.070
and finished also so for them it is very

31:25.150 --> 31:29.860
important that they should also know

31:27.070 --> 31:32.890
what is sahaja yoga they must listen to

31:29.860 --> 31:35.600
my lectures sit down studied nicely and

31:32.890 --> 31:37.610
understand

31:35.600 --> 31:39.470
sahaja yoga is not only meant for men

31:37.610 --> 31:41.060
it's meant for you much more for you

31:39.470 --> 31:42.490
because you are Shakti and I am your

31:41.060 --> 31:45.380
mother

31:42.490 --> 31:47.660
so I find the women lock that they are

31:45.380 --> 31:49.960
more worried about the saris the this

31:47.660 --> 31:52.010
and that and I mean now from the

31:49.960 --> 32:02.120
hairdressing they have come to surrender

31:52.010 --> 32:04.010
that's what I feel with just the same of

32:02.120 --> 32:06.920
course sari is a very good dresser it's

32:04.010 --> 32:09.140
nice to wear by that we give a lot of

32:06.920 --> 32:12.230
encouragement or beavers in India is

32:09.140 --> 32:15.800
very artistic and good that represents

32:12.230 --> 32:17.510
also a very ladylike feminine thing but

32:15.800 --> 32:21.620
that doesn't mean you should become so

32:17.510 --> 32:26.870
feminine that you don't understand

32:21.620 --> 32:29.810
sahaja yoga no sorry means you can also

32:26.870 --> 32:32.150
be very done with the same sari that you
