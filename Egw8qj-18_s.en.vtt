00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:51.820
[Music]

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:55.150
so now we are coming to the point of

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.950
puja because there are so many new

00:00:55.150 --> 00:01:02.440
sahaja Yogi's who I might not have known

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:05.470
what is the puja now as it is now you

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:09.010
all believe that I am Adi Shakti and you

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:11.910
have proof of it puja is one of the way

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:16.030
you can have the proof of it much more

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:19.090
because when you are doing the puja my

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:22.119
deities which are within my chakras they

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:24.910
get excited and they feel happy and they

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:29.320
want to emit more vibrations I mean they

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:32.710
start emitting more vibrations puja is

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:38.020
one of the things by which you can

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:40.960
excite the forms into formless now your

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:45.399
centres are the centres of energies but

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:47.920
they too have a guiding deity sitting on

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:51.670
all these chakras they are also the

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:55.750
formulas made into forms and when you do

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:59.080
the puja reforms melt into formless

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:02.740
energy and this formless energy then

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:06.750
starts flowing and that then blows the

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:09.250
wind and that's how this

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.700
misidentification superimpositions

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:16.180
on the spirit are given now you cannot

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:18.550
think about the future the whole thing

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:23.739
happens in a realm which is beyond

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:27.400
thinking so you have to understand that

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:33.819
you cannot rationalize the puja you

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:41.050
should have the maximum advantage on

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:46.390
your chakras for that you must fully

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:50.230
just concentrate on the puja and how the

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:54.160
wind is blowing and the wind will see to

00:02:50.230 --> 00:03:02.040
it that they drive out all the clouds

00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:07.420
[Music]

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:11.920
so they chewed on a part when they did

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:16.960
supposing the man is doing a filter to a

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:19.660
daily in India they take a great courage

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:21.520
to do puja to a daily you do not know

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:24.700
that substance I think that maybe have

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:28.750
that thing EPA people they were

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:30.550
possessed they can't understand first of

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.190
all they have a statue of someone mean

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:36.220
by some horrible fellow then they didn't

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:40.240
do the food out that what is that what

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:43.390
failure everything is good we have got

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:49.170
temples where there are also they can

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:52.840
say flemmings from the mother earth

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:56.370
which are her sheep and should be

00:03:52.840 --> 00:04:00.610
alright but no they get reversed why

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:05.920
because most of them these temples are

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:09.010
hounded by or haunted by spirits because

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.690
they do all the fancy things there and

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:15.130
when people go hunting the food does

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:23.200
there what happens to them then they get

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:29.260
attacked they become more website but

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:33.100
the puja of only of the goddess is

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:36.100
allowed puja of the God is allowed but

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:39.130
we must know who is the god or who is

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:41.710
the goddess so doing the puja of every

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:43.600
person blindly anybody who comes forward

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:45.190
says this and that should not be

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:48.130
accepted you'd be surprised for the

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:50.400
first four years I said didn't even

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:52.660
allow them to have any pooja worship

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.280
even they said you are about guru so I

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:59.260
should allow us to have guru puja I said

00:04:54.280 --> 00:05:03.340
nothing I will not then first after four

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:05.200
years on the Nara three day they wanted

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:08.050
to have one puja I said all right you

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:10.420
can have it but very few people and then

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:13.300
they found that that puja

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:18.610
gave them so much of vibration so much

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:22.420
of elated spirituality and they touched

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:24.700
so many dimensions suddenly that then

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:26.470
they started requesting me mother you

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:35.139
must give me a poem

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:50.650
[Music]

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:53.539
it's rather difficult or embarrassing as

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:55.000
a human being for me to tell you what

00:05:53.539 --> 00:05:58.430
should be the protocol of the what is

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:02.780
really but I had to tell you because I

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:10.250
don't want you should be harmed but the

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:15.590
protocol must be observed and could be

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:19.180
understood wherever of course it's much

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:27.229
better now first time they had my puja

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:31.669
in Delhi they did my RT with a plastic

00:06:27.229 --> 00:06:34.370
plate and the cuckoo was kept in plastic

00:06:31.669 --> 00:06:37.159
boxes and I was so much worried about

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:39.020
these people that my whole body has

00:06:37.159 --> 00:06:43.760
stunk like this controlling them not

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:46.990
don't do anything if you see my

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:49.580
photograph you see be very different

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:53.720
there was so surprised they didn't know

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:55.760
what to do so don't feel bad for

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:57.740
anything I mean some people feel bad

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:59.210
because they were late for that doesn't

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:01.340
matter that's the time you have to come

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:03.259
some people feel that they could be

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:05.780
something for puja doesn't matter

00:07:03.259 --> 00:07:12.560
I never say you didn't bring this you

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:18.320
didn't do that that you saw or you

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:19.610
should not have done this now what was

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:23.720
the need to tell you otherwise there

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:27.620
would have been another big well of your

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:29.210
ex so you guys before you don't know

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:31.550
what Buddha means you don't know

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:36.530
anything of that time how it helps you

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:38.730
so whatever guys done yeah after our

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:43.710
children when they are going there

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:52.900
only my job is to predict and that I'm

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:57.080
[Music]

00:07:52.900 --> 00:08:00.400
so a new education is needed for us to

00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:06.830
understand its additions of worshipping

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:10.159
it's easy because your mother is always

00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:13.060
available you just tell her there is

00:08:10.159 --> 00:08:16.220
pooja she dress up and come down here

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:19.580
but in tradition at least there should

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:23.270
be an invitation you have to come and

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:25.099
receive and ask for coming because it's

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:27.110
now you see the joke of the whole thing

00:08:25.099 --> 00:08:30.080
is but it's alright because you don't

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:34.760
know it's alright it's not only that I

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:37.339
am saying on the whole ish worship is a

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:40.969
tradition which has come to us from

00:08:37.339 --> 00:08:48.529
great seers and ancient sages anybody

00:08:40.969 --> 00:08:52.130
even say Moses we can say Socrates you

00:08:48.529 --> 00:08:55.640
can say that our air or Markandeya or

00:08:52.130 --> 00:09:00.140
any one of these people have found out

00:08:55.640 --> 00:09:03.860
the ways and methods how to tune our

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:07.550
instruments to the divine achieve the

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:09.680
maximum job how to place the deities

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:12.290
that's the main point is how to please

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:16.570
the deity but it's a crude word pleases

00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:16.570
but how

00:09:19.059 --> 00:09:23.649
I don't know what should I say

00:09:20.709 --> 00:09:29.409
innovation you say or what do you call

00:09:23.649 --> 00:09:33.069
that how to spark them invoke invoke

00:09:29.409 --> 00:09:37.989
them invoke them that they give you

00:09:33.069 --> 00:09:40.359
complete blessings and the trick of the

00:09:37.989 --> 00:09:43.299
trade one has to learn one has to

00:09:40.359 --> 00:09:44.120
educate there's nothing wrong in getting

00:09:43.299 --> 00:09:52.070
educated

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:55.829
[Music]

00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:58.769
all the leaders complain that no one

00:09:55.829 --> 00:10:04.880
wants to pay any money whatsoever for

00:09:58.769 --> 00:10:08.279
cetera now see actually as you know that

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:12.779
whatever money you give me for

00:10:08.279 --> 00:10:17.459
poojas I buy silver fur and you are

00:10:12.779 --> 00:10:24.420
given the equal amount of silver as one

00:10:17.459 --> 00:10:27.630
would give to Europeans but as far as

00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:30.600
the pooja money is concerned it's very

00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:33.720
low first I used to just give me $1 of

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:37.170
course that was all in coins which have

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:40.829
brought it back but otherwise whatever

00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:44.120
is there is I am not using it for myself

00:10:40.829 --> 00:10:47.490
I don't need it I should normally

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:50.430
because it's given to me but I just

00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:53.370
thought that instead of that if I give

00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:56.730
you silver you will have silver for puja

00:10:53.370 --> 00:11:02.459
which is very important and that it will

00:10:56.730 --> 00:11:08.760
be very auspicious that is how we

00:11:02.459 --> 00:11:11.610
started this proper understanding of the

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:15.120
thing that we have to have a particular

00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:17.130
type of metal particular type of styles

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:20.279
now these metals have an effect on us

00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:23.010
very much effect on us and in what metal

00:11:20.279 --> 00:11:25.709
you do the puja also has an effect it's

00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:27.779
all a science of spirituality which one

00:11:25.709 --> 00:11:30.810
must understand is very important and

00:11:27.779 --> 00:11:32.579
should be done in a proper way if you

00:11:30.810 --> 00:11:37.320
have to have the best results it's like

00:11:32.579 --> 00:11:39.959
a science and so the puja started and I

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:41.980
think now people have got quite a good

00:11:39.959 --> 00:11:49.620
sense of it

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:52.839
[Music]

00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:55.769
all the gain that you have from puja is

00:11:52.839 --> 00:12:01.180
only possible when you are realized

00:11:55.769 --> 00:12:04.560
otherwise it is useless to do any puja

00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:07.870
any worship people go to church

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:10.510
seeing few Sims and come back they are

00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:12.880
just the same and afterwards go to the

00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:17.320
pub so they stink probably the only

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:22.660
place where they can get some job one

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:24.310
had to exert one has to sacrifice though

00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:25.570
I may say that sahaja yoga is the

00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:27.430
easiest thing you don't have to go to

00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:31.980
Himalayas to stand on your heads and all

00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:38.200
that but still you have to sacrifice

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:39.940
your time your attention you see I

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:42.070
always tell people unless until they

00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:43.510
have perfectly sir Yogi's you know them

00:12:42.070 --> 00:12:45.820
they are good please don't bring them

00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:48.010
for food but struggles up to me much

00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:50.200
more than to them see they also feel

00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:52.240
your brush does if see they're obliging

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:53.440
mean they think so VIPRE shipping me I

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:55.360
don't know but they don't know how mad

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:57.850
that troubling my coming yet without

00:12:55.360 --> 00:13:00.670
realization the ones who haven't got

00:12:57.850 --> 00:13:07.300
realization are really troublesome they

00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:11.470
don't help so the myth some people have

00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:14.040
that if they come to a puja before

00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:17.200
realization they'll get realization is

00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:19.899
destructive should not bring anyone who

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:21.760
is not a realized soul or who's not a

00:13:19.899 --> 00:13:23.560
sahaja yogi to earth which I struggle

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:26.770
some and that person also starts now

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:30.279
seeing this that all right so from next

00:13:26.770 --> 00:13:33.130
time also this is out of compassion I

00:13:30.279 --> 00:13:37.690
know we do it out of compassion but this

00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:40.690
is not what

00:13:37.690 --> 00:13:43.420
then said me not it helps others alright

00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:45.730
so from next time also anytime you must

00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:47.650
find out a circular say unless and until

00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:49.810
you're sure about the realization of a

00:13:47.650 --> 00:13:52.000
person that is not realization you

00:13:49.810 --> 00:13:54.340
should not call them for the future they

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.620
are no good for mother and they are not

00:13:54.340 --> 00:14:00.700
good for them because they become mushy

00:13:56.620 --> 00:14:02.780
doubting or something you cannot really

00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:11.200
give them realization after that student

00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:18.160
[Music]

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:20.870
now supposing the person is being Epica

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:24.140
he just goes on mean who doesn't love

00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:27.500
from the morning till evening without a

00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:29.330
negative energy to look to talented just

00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:31.900
come down somebody doesn't refer you

00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:37.720
that the vibrations nicely guess for

00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:37.720
nothing to be done no not really

00:14:37.839 --> 00:14:44.089
so there is no balance so they do a

00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:47.420
pooja and they think oh they're done

00:14:44.089 --> 00:14:51.950
when you know if you are right-sided

00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:54.700
person then enjoy a healthy but not if

00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:54.700
you are a left side

00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:04.190
huija does hello of course my feet have

00:15:01.130 --> 00:15:08.830
been held in both the side sleeper than

00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:08.830
and I that left not right not anywhere

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:23.000
that's why in sahaja yoga before the

00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:26.380
puja you have to go into a lot of

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:30.170
faculty you have to decorate the hall

00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:33.350
you have to get me flowers you have to

00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:35.529
organize everything beautifully look at

00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:39.230
the roses how beautiful they are

00:15:35.529 --> 00:15:42.700
then you starts Paris in yourself with

00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:42.700
all these activities you

00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:53.270
and then you sit down Fallujah that's

00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:58.279
like in the daytime Network the night

00:15:53.270 --> 00:16:03.560
rest to rest to get the place you must

00:15:58.279 --> 00:16:09.380
get it like we have to climb I'm

00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:11.750
Alliance to achieve meditation but

00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:15.050
understand your nature supposing you are

00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:17.330
a left-sided process mostly Isis

00:16:15.050 --> 00:16:21.080
left-sided persons always want to do my

00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:25.940
preference and the right-sided persons

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:28.790
are all romances do that early Moscow

00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:32.529
University give your social balance and

00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:32.529
then into the

00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:38.960
[Music]

00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:46.760
the thoughtless awareness when you're

00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:49.580
doing user completely concentrated in

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:56.720
receiving but while Kuja people are

00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:59.480
talking about that's the time something

00:16:56.720 --> 00:17:05.290
is oozing out the nectar and you just

00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:07.850
receive it at the time with devotion my

00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:11.770
vibrations of my chakras at the time was

00:17:07.850 --> 00:17:16.220
a lot that even the minut small little

00:17:11.770 --> 00:17:23.470
feels in my body come a different speed

00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:26.000
a different speed a different dimension

00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:29.780
and I really don't know how to explain

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:32.050
but you see creates the melody you have

00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:36.950
to receive and it is the melody

00:17:32.050 --> 00:17:49.870
individually suitable for every

00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:53.030
individual and so at the time of puja

00:17:49.870 --> 00:18:02.360
you must know that all your attention

00:17:53.030 --> 00:18:06.530
should be in reception so your only work

00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:10.970
is or your only method is just to

00:18:06.530 --> 00:18:15.710
concentrate on the puja and witness you

00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:21.080
are a seer seer has double meaning the

00:18:15.710 --> 00:18:24.830
one who sees only just sees and is only

00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:27.710
knowledge is a seer without any thought

00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:31.640
without any reaction just sees an

00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:36.750
observer automatically spontaneously is

00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:40.809
the seer for me

00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:44.710
sometimes in burdens of because there

00:18:40.809 --> 00:18:48.929
should be some parity between you and

00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:51.640
the deities some balance must be there

00:18:48.929 --> 00:18:54.100
here you are saying all the mantras and

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:57.490
the deities are awakened and there you

00:18:54.100 --> 00:19:00.760
are who do not want to receive anything

00:18:57.490 --> 00:19:03.190
within your heart so I am the one who

00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:07.780
has to store up all the extra energy

00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:11.740
that is produced in the body so it will

00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:15.460
be better if you all keep your hearts

00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:16.820
open and watch the puja without thinking

00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:24.669
about it

00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:32.659
[Music]

00:19:24.669 --> 00:19:36.620
you have got your own petals within

00:19:32.659 --> 00:19:40.279
yourself and these ladies are to be

00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:44.870
awakened within me natives are the

00:19:40.279 --> 00:19:48.080
different aspects of one God so on one

00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:51.159
side you have the deities if the aspects

00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:55.419
of God which are all the time awakened

00:19:51.159 --> 00:19:58.929
on the other side you have your own

00:19:55.419 --> 00:20:02.240
deities which are sometimes awakened

00:19:58.929 --> 00:20:09.799
sometimes half-awakened sometimes

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:17.269
sleeping and sometimes think so you have

00:20:09.799 --> 00:20:25.730
to use two methods one to please

00:20:17.269 --> 00:20:30.159
the deity of God and ask them to bless

00:20:25.730 --> 00:20:37.090
your debt either or to ask them to

00:20:30.159 --> 00:20:43.279
awaken your daily to have the best

00:20:37.090 --> 00:20:49.250
effect or the blessings or the best flow

00:20:43.279 --> 00:20:52.450
of the grace within us we say - the

00:20:49.250 --> 00:20:52.450
sound of mantras

00:20:56.070 --> 00:21:07.350
the sound the Sun he comes into the

00:21:01.670 --> 00:21:10.110
being of God and there be a code on our

00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:14.490
chakras and then the chakras start

00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:18.420
opening more so the flow of the grace of

00:21:14.490 --> 00:21:21.510
God is received but only a realized soul

00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:22.380
should chant a mantra because without

00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:26.130
connection

00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:29.100
how will it reach God that's why in the

00:21:26.130 --> 00:21:32.160
beginning we don't tell them about the

00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:37.740
mantra because in the mantras you have

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:41.400
to accept me as detailed in this advent

00:21:37.740 --> 00:22:13.590
of mind it is made compulsory that you

00:21:41.400 --> 00:22:20.580
have to recognize why have you talked to

00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:24.330
Mataji put the method essentially but

00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:28.560
the first name of home sister number all

00:22:24.330 --> 00:22:30.840
right should I guess she matters when

00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:37.890
you are standardizing the thing who has

00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:41.570
done this you must ask me because that's

00:22:37.890 --> 00:22:41.570
the biggest part is that I am the mother

00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:48.630
and that is actually the name driven by

00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:51.920
the modern people so it must be accepted

00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:51.920
is an additional thing

00:22:54.169 --> 00:23:00.929
when you're standardizing the things you

00:22:56.760 --> 00:23:10.830
must ask me I love you as anything I

00:23:00.929 --> 00:23:12.690
then acceptance over it now I would say

00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:15.240
next time when you come to feed us all

00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:18.059
of you must have you have written the

00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:20.220
names of the verse you must have all the

00:23:18.059 --> 00:23:24.149
papers that are there like we have you

00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:27.419
moved all of us must have these papers

00:23:24.149 --> 00:23:29.250
not only one person should have we

00:23:27.419 --> 00:23:31.500
should try to remember certain things I

00:23:29.250 --> 00:23:33.809
see the names of the bonus' the leaves

00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:35.640
that we decide you should read them a

00:23:33.809 --> 00:23:39.750
million I made and understand them the

00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:41.640
Sanskrit meaning of it and it should

00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:45.590
come to us very easily because that is

00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:45.590
how we are going to work our jungles

00:23:48.130 --> 00:23:58.570
I have to lay down boobs for you now

00:23:55.210 --> 00:24:00.490
because you do not want to meet them I'm

00:23:58.570 --> 00:24:02.950
also amazed that many people do not know

00:24:00.490 --> 00:24:07.150
even my arty after so many years by

00:24:02.950 --> 00:24:10.049
heart that is what sahaja why is because

00:24:07.150 --> 00:24:10.049
it's a Mahamaya

00:24:10.270 --> 00:24:16.930
so you have to learn it yourself you

00:24:14.470 --> 00:24:20.290
have to get yourself

00:24:16.930 --> 00:24:21.610
now when you do that the old so somebody

00:24:20.290 --> 00:24:24.250
is shouting at the top of his voice

00:24:21.610 --> 00:24:25.990
she's trying to lead others then another

00:24:24.250 --> 00:24:27.850
trying to lead others this should not be

00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:31.630
there should be some homogenous I can

00:24:27.850 --> 00:24:37.870
make it up there's no random singing the

00:24:31.630 --> 00:24:40.860
same don't same style try to make it 1-1

00:24:37.870 --> 00:24:40.860
good God

00:24:41.250 --> 00:24:46.360
in a humble way in joyous way that we

00:24:44.230 --> 00:24:49.570
all are singing all our hearts are

00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:51.940
singing all of us are here to do it so

00:24:49.570 --> 00:24:57.600
many of us I feel that joy we are so

00:24:51.940 --> 00:25:02.440
many some of you might feel that by

00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:06.510
knowing some of the parties and things

00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:10.300
by heart you will achieve weight is not

00:25:06.510 --> 00:25:13.480
also because that is also just words but

00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:16.630
if that is an awakened thing within you

00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:20.470
then they become a month and then you

00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:24.670
can work it out but first of all you

00:25:20.470 --> 00:25:28.929
must achieve a certain standard to have

00:25:24.670 --> 00:25:33.000
that power to create momentum also when

00:25:28.929 --> 00:25:36.400
you say Samar P it's not necessarily

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:39.580
possible that it will work out let us

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:43.450
face the things as they are and not to

00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:47.620
be conditioned by anything you have to

00:25:43.450 --> 00:25:56.170
achieve a certain depth within yourself

00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:58.540
to even enlighten the amantha first of

00:25:56.170 --> 00:26:01.420
all you should have clear-cut vibrations

00:25:58.540 --> 00:26:06.280
minimum of meaning if you have certain

00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:09.640
chakras caching then try going through

00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:11.350
your chakras with the photograph with

00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:13.780
all due respect to the photograph it's

00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:18.500
only the photograph which is going to

00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:26.030
work it out nothing else what if I

00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:31.260
[Music]

00:26:26.030 --> 00:26:34.260
so these puja methods and prayer methods

00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:37.770
and human promethazine have been devised

00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:41.250
and found out by great thinkers of

00:26:37.770 --> 00:26:47.400
sahaja yoga the great masters of sahaja

00:26:41.250 --> 00:26:53.960
yoga and it is the effort or you can say

00:26:47.400 --> 00:27:01.860
the effortless effort of Raja yoga that

00:26:53.960 --> 00:27:05.490
makes my body vibrant extract from my

00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:08.160
body I should say they make it makes the

00:27:05.490 --> 00:27:12.720
infinite release itself through the

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:15.450
Trinity and it works it clicks have seen

00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:20.760
it works very well but you know that

00:27:15.450 --> 00:27:22.770
after pooja I get little time because if

00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:27.840
you cannot receive that force

00:27:22.770 --> 00:27:33.720
I want to the creep and get rid of that

00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:39.660
additional vibration into simply by

00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:41.720
entering into the infinite state if you

00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:48.690
could receive whatever I have everything

00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:51.410
in balance with your puja then only it

00:27:48.690 --> 00:27:51.410
helps better

00:27:53.070 --> 00:28:00.580
when they start emitting more vibrations

00:27:56.760 --> 00:28:03.190
then you are surprised that how after

00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:05.110
puja you get so drenched and it just

00:28:03.190 --> 00:28:09.910
feel elevated and at a much higher level

00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:11.770
of course it is true that during the

00:28:09.910 --> 00:28:13.660
puja time you feel very much elevated

00:28:11.770 --> 00:28:16.540
for some time you can give it up some

00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:19.300
people definitely retain it but some

00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:24.120
people go up and down like a yo-yo they

00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:30.210
don't have that capacity to retain it

00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:33.370
now they must meditate also after food

00:28:30.210 --> 00:28:38.320
because my vibrations you do not suck in

00:28:33.370 --> 00:28:42.880
without meditation as always it happens

00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:46.270
so far I had very few he does it which

00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:48.280
my whole vibrations were sucked if you

00:28:46.270 --> 00:28:50.380
have sincerity about it really the

00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:55.630
sincerity part of it will suck all my

00:28:50.380 --> 00:28:59.710
relations tell your mind not to ask

00:28:55.630 --> 00:29:05.070
questions and to misbehave but to suck

00:28:59.710 --> 00:29:10.090
the vibrations yeah this is for your own

00:29:05.070 --> 00:29:13.440
nourishment for your own growth for your

00:29:10.090 --> 00:29:13.440
own angel

00:29:14.550 --> 00:29:21.010
the Poudre has its effect on everyone

00:29:19.180 --> 00:29:23.020
but according to our your depth and

00:29:21.010 --> 00:29:25.300
that's for that you have to have studied

00:29:23.020 --> 00:29:29.170
our field if your mind is still thinking

00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:31.330
you cannot achieve much input while for

00:29:29.170 --> 00:29:34.030
Indians to attend a puja is the highest

00:29:31.330 --> 00:29:35.500
they don't mind my lecture that anything

00:29:34.030 --> 00:29:39.100
if they miss the program doesn't matter

00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:40.810
any music program is alright any kind of

00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:42.460
discomfort is alright as long as they

00:29:40.810 --> 00:29:45.310
can attend to do that today people have

00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:49.450
come from 200 to 300 miles for this

00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:52.870
portion all the way because they know

00:29:49.450 --> 00:29:54.860
this is the knowledge of the roots for

00:29:52.870 --> 00:30:00.100
that you have to do the food

00:29:54.860 --> 00:30:05.620
[Music]

00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:10.120
I have seen many women specially in

00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:13.360
sahaja yoga there are sahaja Yogi's

00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:18.220
their vibrations all that is there but

00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:23.050
they they do not know what is such they

00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:25.930
do not know what these chakras are they

00:30:23.050 --> 00:30:29.340
do not know that how these vibrations

00:30:25.930 --> 00:30:32.740
were now today's lecture is quite a

00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:34.990
lecture cut complicated I would say if

00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:36.820
you see to it will have to listen to it

00:30:34.990 --> 00:30:38.620
at least four or five times to

00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:41.080
understand it with a paper and a pen see

00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:42.520
it's not an easy thing because I am

00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:44.200
telling you now it's alright it is quite

00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:47.700
entertaining but behind the

00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:51.040
entertainment there is a deep knowledge

00:30:47.700 --> 00:30:53.560
so I have not seen the sahaja yoginis

00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:59.050
mostly sit down with a paper and pencil

00:30:53.560 --> 00:31:01.480
to know what is mother saying what is

00:30:59.050 --> 00:31:05.850
the knowledge is giving us about the

00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:05.850
various things to them sorry oka means

00:31:06.270 --> 00:31:14.440
to be nice to cook good food and help

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:17.320
the sahaja Yogi's and that of course for

00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:19.960
the puja is to wear nice saris and nice

00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:25.150
dresses come to the puja and all that

00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:27.070
and finished also so for them it is very

00:31:25.150 --> 00:31:29.860
important that they should also know

00:31:27.070 --> 00:31:32.890
what is sahaja yoga they must listen to

00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:35.600
my lectures sit down studied nicely and

00:31:32.890 --> 00:31:37.610
understand

00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:39.470
sahaja yoga is not only meant for men

00:31:37.610 --> 00:31:41.060
it's meant for you much more for you

00:31:39.470 --> 00:31:42.490
because you are Shakti and I am your

00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:45.380
mother

00:31:42.490 --> 00:31:47.660
so I find the women lock that they are

00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:49.960
more worried about the saris the this

00:31:47.660 --> 00:31:52.010
and that and I mean now from the

00:31:49.960 --> 00:32:02.120
hairdressing they have come to surrender

00:31:52.010 --> 00:32:04.010
that's what I feel with just the same of

00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:06.920
course sari is a very good dresser it's

00:32:04.010 --> 00:32:09.140
nice to wear by that we give a lot of

00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:12.230
encouragement or beavers in India is

00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:15.800
very artistic and good that represents

00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:17.510
also a very ladylike feminine thing but

00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:21.620
that doesn't mean you should become so

00:32:17.510 --> 00:32:26.870
feminine that you don't understand

00:32:21.620 --> 00:32:29.810
sahaja yoga no sorry means you can also

00:32:26.870 --> 00:32:32.150
be very done with the same sari that you

00:32:29.810 --> 00:32:34.940
are wearing even the saris of the nine

00:32:32.150 --> 00:32:38.390
yards we have had queens view for the

00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:42.350
English so though you see the Indian

00:32:38.390 --> 00:32:46.850
women look so designed and simple but

00:32:42.350 --> 00:32:50.680
when it comes to their personality they

00:32:46.850 --> 00:32:50.680
are capable of tremendous things

00:32:53.780 --> 00:32:59.180
so this character when you are wearing

00:32:57.170 --> 00:33:04.780
the saris you must also know how to try

00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:04.780
out the backside and sight

00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:13.570
otherwise you have not got the search

00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:16.390
culture in you either you are very

00:33:13.570 --> 00:33:22.540
dominating or you are so docile like

00:33:16.390 --> 00:33:27.790
cabbages you must understand that we

00:33:22.540 --> 00:33:31.420
have to be alert very alert when mother

00:33:27.790 --> 00:33:33.060
depends on us on our own personalities

00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:35.740
that the way we are going to develop

00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:38.560
ourselves our children our husbands our

00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:42.040
Society of sahaja yoga the whole of each

00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:48.130
veneer mother is the woman who makes the

00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:53.520
society the whole universe is in the

00:33:48.130 --> 00:33:58.390
hands of a woman who creates children

00:33:53.520 --> 00:34:00.600
just enjoy don't miss the point we got

00:33:58.390 --> 00:34:00.600
this

00:34:01.090 --> 00:34:45.500
[Music]
