00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.720
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:22.560
At the very outset you have to know that truth is what it is.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:26.560
We cannot change it.

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.840
We cannot transform it

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.240
and we cannot conceptualize it.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:39.720
Also unfortunately at this human awareness

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.520
we cannot feel the truth,

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.160
so something has to be done,

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:01.440
something has to work out in our human awareness

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.600
in the evolutionary process.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.160
We have become human beings from amoeba.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.040
How did we become?

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.600
And if we are human beings

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.920
have we reached the Absolute State? We have not.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.120
If we had reached the absolute state

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.800
then there would have been no problems

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.040
because everybody would have seen the same thing,

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.120
would have understood the same thing

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.840
and felt the same thing

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.760
but because we are living in a relative world

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.480
we have all these problems.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.960
As it is, most of the problems are created

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.840
by human beings.

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.320
If you see ecological problems,

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:05.120
if you see economic problems, political problems,

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.040
physical problems,

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.720
mental problems, family problems,

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:17.360
all of them are related to human beings.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:24.440
So we have gone wrong somewhere,

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.800
there's something that's a missing point

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.680
which we have not realized.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:36.360
The advancements we have made in our civilization,

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.280
say in science,

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.960
has reached such a stage that we had to create atom bomb,

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.040
hydrogen bomb.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.680
So all these mental efforts we have put in also boomerang on us

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.560
and create our destruction.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.440
In every way we get frustrated,

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.160
and we start seeking what's the matter?

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.320
Then we turn to religion

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.720
and we find in religion also

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.680
it just works worse and worse.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.520
Whatever is written in the Bible,

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.320
same about written in Koran if you read it, or Dhammapada

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.640
or Gita everywhere is about just the same,

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.800
there's not much of a change.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.440
But still we may follow any religion,

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.640
so-called following I would say.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:40.960
Still a human being belonging to any religion can commit any sin,

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.840
any sin.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.920
There's no binding force on him of that religion.

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:51.160
Why is it all these great religions,

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.720
which were created by great incarnations

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:00.160
and great prophets

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:05.240
have taken such a deviated path,

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.800
and why we have not been able to achieve

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:12.560
whatever they have promised to us?

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:18.360
What is the reason why we could not achieve that?

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:21.840
What has gone wrong?

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.560
If you read Koran you will be amazed,

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:33.200
the description of what was the vision of Mohammad Sahib

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.520
is far away from the Muslims as they are.

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.080
Same about Christians you can say.

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:45.520
When Christ has said "Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes."

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.840
Difficult to find Christians who don't have.

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.880
In this way we have to realize on one side

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:02.320
whatever mental efforts we are putting,

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.560
or on the other side whatever

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.840
physical or emotional efforts we are putting,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.960
have come back to us,

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.960
destroying us.

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:24.360
We can see the result very clearly

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:27.880
why all these problems are there.

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:33.440
Still we adhere to something which is not reality.

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.800
We go on clinging to it

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.800
because perhaps we are born like that.

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:43.160
Perhaps we think that that's we have done now all our lives

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:44.920
so why give up.

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.960
And the forefathers have done the same,

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.920
you are doing the same.

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.560
But now a new category of very honest people are there

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:57.040
in this world who are seeking beyond.

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:00.960
William Blake has called them men of God,

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:05.160
those who will seek the truth

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:10.080
and they will make other people also godly.

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.920
That's the time has come, this resurrection time has come we should say

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.520
or this is the Last Judgment.

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:20.640
This Last Judgment is going to be done

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.000
by this Kundalini, the power within you.

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:26.440
This is your own power

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
which has to be awakened

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:33.520
and once it is awakened it passes through these centers as told to you

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:37.240
and lets you know that these are your problems.

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.280
These are the problems of your chakras.

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:43.960
They may be physical, may be emotional,

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:49.040
they may be, could be also spiritual.

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:50.920
And once you know these problems

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:54.200
and if you know how to solve these problems

00:06:54.360 --> 00:07:01.960
you can be a very normal, sensible, balanced personality.

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:04.440
That's not the only thing that happens

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:08.000
when you get your self realization.

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:11.880
Firstly what happens to you is that

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:16.440
when the Kundalini passes through your Agyna chakra

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:20.800
then you become thoughtlessly aware.

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:27.640
If you see all the sciences they have created about religion,

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:32.560
talks and the whole thing, it's just mental.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:39.440
It's not inside, it's not innate, built within.

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:42.480
So one thought rises, another thought falls.

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:45.640
Another thought rises and falls down,

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:49.520
some come from the future, some come from the past,

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:54.280
and we are jumping on the cusp of these thoughts.

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:58.200
But if you say now, this is the present,

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:01.320
stop your mind at the stop point

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:03.120
which is the present, you can't,

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:06.240
you just can't do it.

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:10.440
Between these thoughts there is a gap.

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:15.000
This gap is the present, but it's so small, it's so small

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:17.600
that you cannot find it.

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:22.160
But when the Kundalini passes through,

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:26.400
then this center, then these two institutions as you see them,

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:30.360
the conditioning and the ego are just sucked in.

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:34.200
As a result you become thoughtlessly aware.

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:36.040
Means there is no thought.

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:39.160
But you are absolutely aware, very much more aware.

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:42.520
For example if you look at this beautiful hall

00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:47.440
with the thoughtless awareness,

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:51.000
then the whole picture becomes clear

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:54.640
like a photo in your mind,

00:08:54.800 --> 00:09:01.520
whole thing is stored up into every detail so clearly

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:04.040
because present is the truth,

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:07.720
past is finished and future doesn't exist.

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:11.000
So to come to the present you have to have

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:15.280
this new awareness called as thoughtless awareness.

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:17.920
But when She crosses over

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:20.880
and pierces through your fontanel bone area

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:26.520
which is the actualization of your baptism.

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:30.440
Just people talk of baptism, "Come along I'll baptize you".

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:32.040
It's not possible that way.

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:34.560
It's just an artificial ritual.

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:37.560
Try to understand, this is not going to render

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:40.120
that actual happening within you

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:44.120
which is going to make you grow spiritually.

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:46.800
So the actualization of baptism takes place

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:50.600
and you can feel also from your fontanel bone area

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:56.000
a kind of a cool breeze of the Holy Ghost coming in.

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:59.680
You feel extremely relaxed.

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:05.040
Secondly that you jump into another higher awareness

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:08.960
which we call, as collective consciousness.

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:10.920
This means that

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:14.680
not only that you can you feel your own centers on your fingertips,

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:20.760
because these cool vibrations you can call

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:23.320
them start flowing through your own hands,

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:25.680
you can feel them.

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:29.720
But also you get information about others

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:33.840
as well as about yourself on these fingertips.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:41.400
Automatically you become like a person who is a computer.

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:44.280
It starts working in such a wonderful manner

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:47.680
that you can find out about any disease,

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:52.200
any trouble without going through all the diagnosis or anything,

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:56.120
and if you know how to cure these troubles, physically, mentally,

00:10:56.280 --> 00:11:00.160
you can definitely cure yourself and also others

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:02.000
if you have reached that state

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:06.880
and have permanently achieved it.

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:11.720
This is what has to happen to us.

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:15.160
All of us have to achieve that state

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:18.600
which is your right to achieve it.

00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:22.360
Sahaja means with you is born.

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:24.640
This yoga means the union.

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:30.880
The union with this All Pervading Power of God's love.

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:36.840
It exists or not, we have never bothered to find out.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.760
We see these beautiful flowers,

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:42.800
very beautiful flowers and everything around.

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:45.320
When I came from Sydney I saw the beauty,

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:49.960
the nature had just spread for the pleasure of human beings,

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:53.440
we never even think how it has happened,

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:56.040
what has worked it out, all these living things.

00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:59.360
We don't even think how this eye of ours

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:04.560
is such a beautiful camera, how it has been made,

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:08.560
how is it this brain which is such a great computer,

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:13.320
how is it made. Who has made it?

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:16.840
They may say it is autonomous but who is this auto?

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.520
We have never tried to find out.

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:21.960
That there is this All Pervading Power of God's love

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:24.320
which has done all this living work

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:27.480
and now for us it is to feel that,

00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:31.320
that is the yoga is, the union with that Divine.

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:34.000
It's not physical, it's not mental,

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:36.280
but it is spiritual where

00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:40.760
you start first time feeling this All Pervading Power.

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:44.800
Then only you have to know how to use this power

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:47.680
which flows through you.

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:52.400
But it moves very slowly and people,

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:54.760
you see this is not a plastic work

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:56.680
that you can go on producing many

00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:59.120
and we don't have any organization as such,

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:01.160
we do not organize people

00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:04.840
and we do not take any money at all, you cannot.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
How much can you pay for this Divine Work?

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:11.200
How much do we pay to Mother Earth for what she gives us

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:13.280
all these beautiful flowers?

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:16.760
She doesn't understand money, so you cannot pay for it.

00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:19.920
But there are many, many organizations afloat,

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:23.560
which are taking money, which are giving you mental heat

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:25.200
and people run after them,

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:28.760
they like to go on working out that yarn

00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:32.560
that they have spun for you.

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:38.480
One has to go beyond this mind to feel the spirituality.

00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:42.240
With this mind, that is human mind, you cannot understand it,

00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:44.440
you have to have Divine mind.

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:46.560
But once you get your realization

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:49.160
your mind also gets enlightened,

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:53.640
and when your mind is enlightened, you can perceive,

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:57.440
penetrate into every situation

00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:03.920
in such a deeper manner and the way you can improve it.

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:07.280
I can tell you a simple analogy to understand.

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:15.240
Supposing you are standing in the sea and the sea is rough,

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:18.520
you are afraid of the waves, very much afraid.

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:22.160
But supposing somebody puts you on the boat,

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:26.280
and then you can see those waves and enjoy them.

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:28.760
But supposing you learn how to swim

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:31.560
then you can jump in and save them.

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:33.840
It is not any brainwashing

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.320
or any sort of a bombardment of words,

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:41.240
but it is something that happens to you.

00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:44.840
You become something as you have become human beings,

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.120
you become realized souls

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:53.120
as a result of this last breakthrough of your evolution.

00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:56.040
This is happening everywhere no doubt

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:58.920
and it's working out very well in,

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:02.320
I think they told me, 62 countries

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:05.760
but at least I know of definitely of 52 countries

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:08.360
where there We have got very strong centers

00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:11.240
where it is working out.

00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:13.400
Now whatever we are telling you here

00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:15.880
you need not accept blindfolded.

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:18.880
Blind faith is of no use.

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:22.160
First of all you must experience.

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:25.880
Just like a hypothesis I am putting this before you,

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:29.160
but you should have an open mind of a scientist.

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:32.880
Just open your mind and see for yourself it works.

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:35.760
If it works then you have to accept.

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:37.960
If you are honest you have to accept.

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:40.720
If it doesn't work. If it works with many,

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:43.240
why not try and work it out.

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:46.560
Most of the people do get their realization. I have seen it.

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:48.520
It's a wonderful thing that is happening

00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:51.680
that masses of people can get realization.

00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:55.960
Depends on also certain places like Russia I was amazed.

00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:57.840
Where they have not heard the name of God

00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.400
they have never heard the name of Christ.

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:02.440
They were not allowed to read Bible or any book,

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:04.280
they had no religion at all.

00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:06.160
They believed in no religion.

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:10.800
Where thousands and thousands come to My program

00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:13.680
and they all get their realization.

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:16.320
In a small place called Togliati

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:21.120
there are 22 thousand Sahaja Yogis practicing Sahaja Yoga.

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:24.040
Can you imagine it? I was so amazed.

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:29.480
Same about Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Poland.

00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:32.800
I was amazed how these people, Czechoslovakia,

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:35.640
how they have taken to Sahaja Yoga so fast,

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:39.160
just like fish to water,

00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:41.880
how they realized it, and nobody else,

00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:43.800
all these false people, could not go there,

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:46.640
nothing could work out.

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:49.080
Only thing that has really worked out there

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:53.680
is something that is genuine. That is Sahaja Yoga.

00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:58.840
One has to realize that as we are not in the Absolute State,

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.560
we have to reach to the Absolute State.

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:04.920
That desire should be there.

00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:07.320
If that desire is there it works out

00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:09.320
without any difficulty.

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:11.800
It is your own power which manifests

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:14.880
and gradually you can manifest them in such a way

00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:19.960
that you can do so many things like giving realization to others,

00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:26.680
curing others and also enjoying it,

00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:32.800
because when the attention is filled with the light of the Spirit,

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:37.080
it fills you up with complete joy,

00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:42.080
and joy has not two sides like happiness and unhappiness.

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:47.680
It's singular, it's absolute and you are then,

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:55.240
they say they are swimming in the ocean of joy.

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:57.080
So beautiful it is.

00:17:57.240 --> 00:18:04.760
This new race, we can call it.

00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:08.200
The new society, is already formed.

00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:12.120
It's there, they're angel-like people, beautiful.

00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:15.200
I never tell them, don't drink, don't smoke,

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:18.680
don't take drugs, nothing of the kind. I don't tell them,

00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:21.240
it just automatically drops out

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:24.320
because in the light they see the ignorance that they had.

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:26.920
They see the darkness and they just drop it.

00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:28.760
We don't have to tell them anything,

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:35.400
not to brainwash them or anything; it just works automatically.

00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:38.000
You don't have to follow any kind

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:41.240
of a fundamental groups or things, nothing of the kind.

00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:46.360
You just know this is fundamental because you have got

00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:49.360
the light within you, then they see the goodness,

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:51.920
then they see the oneness of all the religions.

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:54.520
So if you know the oneness of all the religions,

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:56.600
why will you be fundamentalist?

00:18:56.760 --> 00:19:00.800
If you belong to one organization or to another church

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:03.680
or to another religion then you fight.

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:07.280
When you get into compartments like this, then only you fight.

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:10.240
Everybody thinks we are the chosen ones,

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:13.720
that's how we have this fundamentalism now,

00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:17.680
knocking at our doors. So to get rid of it

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:19.680
the best thing is. First of all

00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:22.160
you have to become a universal being,

00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:25.200
and this Spirit is the Universal Being.

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:27.160
Once you become the Universal Being

00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:29.200
then you will be surprised to see it,

00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:33.600
that all these differences you saw because of complete ignorance.

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:36.240
For example there is light you can see each other here,

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:40.040
but supposing there is complete pitch darkness,

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:43.840
you don't know who's sitting here, who is right, who is left..

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.160
You don't know how to walk.

00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:48.440
You may trample over people, you may just get frightened,

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:50.960
you may run helter skelter.

00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:54.000
But if there is light you see things so clearly.

00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:57.160
In the same way Sahaja Yoga works first.

00:19:57.320 --> 00:20:00.240
Some people get not all the light I should say,

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:03.920
but they do get a little light, a glimmer of light,

00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:06.440
and then it starts expanding. And when it expands

00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:10.360
you will be amazed how things work out.

00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:13.440
Also I have seen people after coming to Sahaja Yoga,

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:17.120
they become extremely intelligent, absorbent,

00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:20.640
and a kind of a very dynamic personality comes in them.

00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:24.040
Now you have seen these Australians singing Sanskrit songs.

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:26.320
I mean imagine, Sanskrit,

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:29.400
even these English lived in India for 300 years,

00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:32.120
they couldn't learn one sentence of Hindi language,

00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:36.440
leave alone Sanskrit, but the way they are singing with such

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:39.320
clarity, even the Indians are surprised

00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:42.760
at how they are singing our songs in Sanskrit language.

00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:44.360
It is an impossibility,

00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:48.000
you cannot think of a Western person singing like this

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:50.400
with all the rhythm and the melody and all that

00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:54.000
and in no time they pick it up.

00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:58.440
There are artists and artists who have now got world fame in India

00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:01.920
after coming to Sahaja Yoga. We have got here also

00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:06.960
some artists who were painters and have become very,

00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:11.080
have got a good name for themselves. Everything changes.

00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:14.920
You become on top of the world but you don't become competitive,

00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:17.280
you start enjoying each other.

00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:21.320
Such a brotherhood, such love, such friendship,

00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:27.600
that you become one drop becoming an ocean,

00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:30.720
microcosm becoming the macrocosm.

00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:34.920
We talk about these things but we have never achieved it.

00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:39.560
Now the time has come for us to achieve all this.

00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:42.760
In this one lecture I know I can't talk much.

00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:45.280
Last year also I was here

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:48.760
and Lord Mayor was here also to grace the occasion.

00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:51.720
I found him to be a remarkable person,

00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:54.280
the way he got his realization.

00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:56.600
You are especially blessed people I think,

00:21:56.760 --> 00:22:00.480
Newcastle with this beautiful lake here

00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:04.960
and beautiful surroundings, and I hope that

00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:07.560
Sahaja Yoga will work out here very well.

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:11.040
Gradually it will take its roots,

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:15.240
and you can have a real good center in Newcastle.

00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:17.220
May God bless you all.
