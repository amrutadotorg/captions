00:00:01.689 --> 00:00:19.850
I 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:33.500
bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:43.170
I bow to them because they are a special category
of human beings which is described by William

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:56.739
Blake as the men of God who will become prophets
and they will have powers to make others prophets.

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:01.700
This is what is described by many other seers
in India also.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:07.390
All over the world people have talked about
the resurrection time.

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:17.090
Mohammed Sahib in His Koran has described
that at the time of resurrection your hands

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.760
will speak.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:28.560
Like when the disciples of Christ got their
blessings of Self realization from the Holy

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:38.501
Ghost which came as a cool breeze upon Him
they started using their hands because they

00:01:38.501 --> 00:01:45.970
felt the power flowing through them and they
started speaking the language which was strange.

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:54.000
That was the language of the chakras and that's
why people thought they were off their minds,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.160
they didn't understand.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:09.340
But today we are in a special time which I
call as the blossom time.

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:16.680
We do not have only twelve people who are
seeking, twelve hundred who are seeking, but

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.780
thousands and thousands, millions and millions.

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:29.950
This seeking has come to us from ages, we
have been seekers from ages, though in the

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:39.580
western contries the tradition of seeking
has lost its meaning very much because of

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.440
industralisation.

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:49.620
It has grown like a tree which does not know
about its roots.

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:57.209
In India the climate was very gentle, I think,
and it's a very old country.

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:03.850
Since long people have been seeking why we
are on this earth, why God has made us human

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:12.770
beings, why should we be in such incomplete
state.

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:19.240
Still we are living in a relative world if
you understand.

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.470
We do not what is right and wrong is.

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:31.410
Shri Krishna has said that there are three
types of people in this world which create

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:32.410
problems.

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:43.540
The first type is the type which always takes
to something wrong, destructive, and run after

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.390
it and destroys oneself, emotional things.

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:53.650
He gets emotional attachments to wrong things,
he doesn't value his life much relatively,

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:59.020
and he destroys himself.

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:08.120
Then the second type of people who are which
he calls as the rajasikas who are futuristic,

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:15.880
the first are the ones who live in the past,
are the rajasikas, are the people who are

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:20.340
futuristic, as we are in the West, very much
futuristic.

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:27.030
We are planning all the time what we are going
to do next moment, but this moment, when we

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.560
are here, we are not there.

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.780
They are not capable of knowing what is right
and wrong.

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:41.970
Sometimes they may do right but mostly they
go towards wrong because they do not know

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:45.250
what is right and what is wrong.

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:51.150
The reason why we go towards wrong much more
is this: that we have come from carbon, say

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.050
earlier, from matter.

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:57.190
Matter always fights the spirit.

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:07.810
Say for example, we get used to anything that
is material, a chair, we cannot sit on the

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:08.810
ground.

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:13.470
If you are used to a bed we cannot sleep on
the ground.

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:16.840
So the matter is always trying to give us
habits.

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:24.710
It is trying to overpower us, and that's how
we start getting into a comfortable understanding

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:30.950
that we have to be dominated by matter.

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:41.580
So such people who are on the rajasic side,
we call them the rightsided people, are guided

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:48.680
by the ego that developed because they convert
matter into some form and they think they

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.470
achieved a lot.

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:58.790
As I said, a tree dies and they create a chair
and that chair sits on your head and you think

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:00.860
you have achieved a lot.

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:06.300
So this is what happens that the ego, as you
see on the right hand side, starts developing

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:11.110
and when it develops it guides you.

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:17.370
It can misguide you many a times, because
when there is ego pampering we feel happy

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:20.580
and when there is no ego pampering we feel
unhappy.

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:24.940
Like if you tell somebody, "Oh I like that".

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:29.509
Even a person, whom I met, who was trying
to hijack some plane.

00:06:29.509 --> 00:06:33.250
So I said, "Why are you doing it, why do you
want to hijack a plane?"

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:38.180
He said, "For the heck of it, for the heck
of it."

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:42.030
I said, "But don't you think you'll be putting
so many people into trouble this?"

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:46.530
He said, "But I'll appear in the newspapers
as a great hero."

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:50.100
So the concept of the goodness is not there.

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:58.360
Benevolence is not there, but the concept
of something standing out, something out of

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:02.880
the blue, they want to show off that they
are something greater.

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:10.750
And in London we have a kind of funny people,
I don't know you might be having them here

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:11.750
also.

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:19.160
They call themselves punks and they came to
Me, to My program with pins here and pins

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:20.160
there.

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:24.500
All pins actually, in the noses, all over
pins, and with the hair dyed.

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:26.400
I asked them, "Why do you do it?"

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:28.630
They said, "What's wrong?"

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:32.530
There's no answer to it, what's wrong?

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:34.150
But what's so good about it?

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:37.110
Why to waste your energy on this nonsenical
thing?

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:39.200
"I like it."

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:42.999
If you like it then that's the last word,
"I like it."

00:07:42.999 --> 00:07:47.760
That's how we live and thats how we grow with
it.

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:53.080
But one must understand we are neither our
conditionings, which is the superego which

00:07:53.080 --> 00:08:02.840
is the psyche as described by this horrible
fellow Freud, or we are the ego as described

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:08.220
by other people, say, Sartre, and all this.

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:15.470
When he denied that you should not get into
any conditioning, he had no discretion of

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:16.470
any kind.

00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:19.990
Because if you have no conditioning what do
you have?

00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:24.630
Is nothing but pure ego, pure ego.

00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:32.260
There's something like good conditioning also
and that good condition makes us to stay in

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:39.570
the center, binds us to that central path
which is described by Buddha.

00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:45.040
You have to keep to the central path.

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:47.020
That is, you keep with your ten valencies.

00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:50.640
Carbon has got four, you've got ten valencies.

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:54.980
These ten valencies of balance are very important.

00:08:54.980 --> 00:09:01.240
Once you go into imbalances because of your
superego, of your conditioning, or because

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:10.100
of your too much of ego, you land up first
of all into physical problems, then into mental

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:17.910
problems, then into spiritual problems, and
lastly it's finished, it's complete destruction.

00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:27.230
Now the problems we are facing in the West
are coming more from the right side than from

00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:28.900
the left side.

00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:40.240
To overcome this I thought Christ was the
solution because He came as an antidote for

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:41.240
that.

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:47.810
On the contrary, in all the Christian nations
if you find, people have been extremely aggressive

00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:48.880
on other races.

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:55.910
Can you believe it, they are supposed to be
Christians taking Bible in one hand and pistol

00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:58.930
in another hand.

00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:10.470
That was really so misguiding that in India
those who were great people, sages, they never

00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:16.730
understood Christ because is described that
such and such a personality is going to be

00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:17.730
born.

00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:19.210
He is the one who's the support of the universe.

00:10:19.210 --> 00:10:26.980
He is the one who will die and establish the
principle of eternal life.

00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:33.630
All being described very nicely in the Devi
Mahatmayan, a book written about fourteen

00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:36.310
thousand years back, you'll be surprised.

00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:42.720
But when they saw these people with the bible
in the hand and the revolver in another hand,

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:48.880
or a gun, or sometimes a cannon, they said,
"This cannot be because He is supposed to

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:55.110
be saumya: means mild, mildness.

00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:57.769
That's why they gave up the hope.

00:10:57.769 --> 00:11:08.850
We too must understand the knowledge of the
tree is not sufficient, we have to have knowledge

00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:18.670
of the roots, and that's why I say the seekers
are a special category of human beings who

00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:28.810
feel that they have to still know about the
roots, about the region from where they are

00:11:28.810 --> 00:11:31.680
going to be nourished.

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:36.250
The third type of people are the seekers,
the sattva gunis.

00:11:36.250 --> 00:11:44.520
They try to avoid extremes, they try to keep
in the center, they are the ones who are best

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:45.520
seekers.

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:48.600
Of course in seeking also people go astray.

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:52.970
They go astray in so many ways.

00:11:52.970 --> 00:12:01.480
Like, they may like a person because he is
giving them some sort of a workshop to work

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:06.210
out, they like to work, they want to achieve
something through work.

00:12:06.210 --> 00:12:10.800
They don't like something that is easily available.

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:16.180
Sahaja Yoga, saha means 'with' and ja is 'born'
with you.

00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:25.120
Sahaja Yoga is a spontaneous, living happening
of the evolutionary process within you, of

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:31.620
the living God, is the living energy within
you, which is this kundalini, which is the

00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:36.740
true desire within you to become the Divine.

00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:47.070
How can you pay for this kundalini, she doesn't
understand money, like the Mother Earth [the

00:12:47.070 --> 00:13:00.310
sound drops out where Shri Mataji is telling
the story of how Mother Earth germinates the

00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:01.310
seed].

00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:15.330
In the same way, the kundalini in her own
nature awakens because she is your own mother.

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:22.040
She is like a tape recorder which has taped
everything that was your past.

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:31.250
She's the one who is waiting for a chance
to give you your second birth.

00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:34.120
This is what you have within yourself.

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:40.300
Now when I'm telling you about these things
you need not also believe in Me with blind

00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:41.870
faith, not necessary at all.

00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:48.889
You may not deny, but you should understand
that whatever I'm saying is like a hypothesis

00:13:48.889 --> 00:13:50.880
a scientist can put before you.

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:55.600
But keep your minds open like a scientist
has.

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:59.339
Supposing a scientist already knows about
everything then what's the use of telling

00:13:59.339 --> 00:14:06.010
anything to the scientist but as he keeps
his mind open, in the same way you keep your

00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:13.330
minds open you'll understand this is a hypothesis
and this hypothesis if it is proved, then

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:15.050
you have to believe in it.

00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:20.870
But we believe into things about, in nothing
is known to us, any kind of a mental projection

00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:23.360
comes in, we just believe in.

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:29.149
I'm surprised how people have changed so many
of their habits suddenly because some sort

00:14:29.149 --> 00:14:35.370
of a mental projection has come forward, that
you must wear this kind of dresses, that is

00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:39.170
good for you, you must eat this kind of food,
that is good for you.

00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:45.080
Like, I went to Switzerland I was surprised
they were eating cottonseed.

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:51.760
I was shocked, cottonseeds, how can human
beings consume, only in India buffaloes eat.

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:52.790
How can you eat cottonseed?

00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:57.890
They said, "This is a special now diet created
for our health."

00:14:57.890 --> 00:15:04.060
I said, "I tell you will end up very fast
with this because your intestines are not

00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:09.530
that sturdy as the buffalo has, you are a
delicate human being, how can you eat this?"

00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:11.740
They said, "No, this is what it is said."

00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:15.230
But I said, "Whenever somebody has said it,
why do you accept it readily like that?

00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:20.480
See some people who are eating it first of
all, what happens to them.

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:24.950
If they give it to say some sort of animals
and if they can digest it that doesn't mean

00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:26.260
you can digest also."

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:32.820
Any sort of a fad, any sort of a new mental
idea comes to a rajasic's personality, he

00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:33.820
accepts.

00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:37.450
He likes to have change all the time.

00:15:37.450 --> 00:15:42.300
Change that what it wants to such an extent
that they'll change their hairstyles and everybody

00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:44.320
will be wearing the same hairstyles.

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:49.180
Then again a second time you will see them
having another style and that is a fashion

00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:50.180
goes on.

00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:55.769
They don't know by doing this they are really
creating not an individualistic taste at all,

00:15:55.769 --> 00:15:59.970
but quite a common stuff goes on.

00:15:59.970 --> 00:16:11.829
The problem is that we are looking at ourselves
as something superficial, something very outside.

00:16:11.829 --> 00:16:17.070
If you dress up like this, like some people
dressed up just like a primitive people came

00:16:17.070 --> 00:16:18.399
to Me.

00:16:18.399 --> 00:16:22.950
I asked them, "Why are you like this, why
do you dress up like this primitive people

00:16:22.950 --> 00:16:26.300
like this, and all your dress is so dirty."

00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:28.730
He said, "We want to be primitive."

00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:32.630
Now by dressing up like that can you become
primitive?

00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:37.880
Your brain is so modern how can you become
primitive by dressing up like that?

00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:44.860
This is the problem with us, we think by doing
something superficial we will get something

00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:50.120
within ourselves and this is one of the biggest
hurdles in your seeking.

00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:55.370
You have to know that by changing your name,
by chanting something, by doing all this madness

00:16:55.370 --> 00:17:01.600
that people are doing, some people start jumping,
screaming, shouting, this all you can do otherwise

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:02.600
also.

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:05.809
Also this is not the way it's going to happen.

00:17:05.809 --> 00:17:08.799
It is antar yoga, the inner yoga.

00:17:08.799 --> 00:17:14.649
The inner yoga has to take place, kundalini
has to rise, you have to get your realization

00:17:14.649 --> 00:17:19.759
as an experience on your central nervous system.

00:17:19.759 --> 00:17:24.470
Like as on your central nervous system you
have got the rest of your evolution.

00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:32.169
You are a human being, now with your own eyes
you can see things, more than the animals

00:17:32.169 --> 00:17:33.820
can see.

00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:41.690
You can feel the dirt and filth much more
than an animal can feel.

00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:46.309
If you want a dog to pass through a dirty
lane he passes through.

00:17:46.309 --> 00:17:47.309
But not you.

00:17:47.309 --> 00:17:51.129
You cannot do it because you are a human being,
you have developed a new "experiencer" within

00:17:51.129 --> 00:17:56.830
you, a new "experiencer", which knows the
experience of the dirt and filth, and of cleanliness.

00:17:56.830 --> 00:18:02.109
So you are so clean, you wash yourself, you're
keeping everything clean, you can't bear bad

00:18:02.109 --> 00:18:04.730
smells and things like that.

00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:12.110
In some way the evolution if it has to take
place within you, you have to develop an "experiencer"

00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:19.989
of goodness, of righteoness, of virtue by
which I don't have to tell you, you do this,

00:18:19.989 --> 00:18:25.749
you do that, or nobody has to tell you, but
you yourself become that.

00:18:25.749 --> 00:18:33.440
That yourself, themselves, develop that special
capacity, that special experience that makes

00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:34.789
you a good person.

00:18:34.789 --> 00:18:41.570
We talk of peace, big organisations, My husband
himself is a Secretary General of one of them

00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:44.700
and he says no use because people have to
be transformed.

00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:50.529
Unless and until they are transformed there's
no use doing it, they are just the same.

00:18:50.529 --> 00:18:55.170
Unless and until there's peace within yourselves
what's the use of talking about peace?

00:18:55.170 --> 00:19:02.879
We need that transformation for which, you'll
be surprised, we are specially made.

00:19:02.879 --> 00:19:09.619
The instrument is here like any instrument
you can see, this is an instrument, unless

00:19:09.619 --> 00:19:11.769
and until I put it to the mains it doesn't
work.

00:19:11.769 --> 00:19:17.739
Unless and until you are put to the mains
you do not work.

00:19:17.739 --> 00:19:21.239
The energy doesn't flow through you.

00:19:21.239 --> 00:19:25.879
Let the energy which is all-pervading, which
is doing all the living work.

00:19:25.879 --> 00:19:30.149
Actually we don't do anything, but what we
do is a dead work.

00:19:30.149 --> 00:19:38.770
All the living work which is transforming,
say, of flowers in the fruits, can we do that?

00:19:38.770 --> 00:19:47.049
For example, I say but thousand and one, like
even looking after our breathing, pumping

00:19:47.049 --> 00:19:49.460
our hearts regularly.

00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:55.519
If you run fast, then sympathetic goes into
action, that we control but it comes to normal,

00:19:55.519 --> 00:19:56.519
automatically.

00:19:56.519 --> 00:19:57.519
How does it happen?

00:19:57.519 --> 00:19:59.090
What works it out?

00:19:59.090 --> 00:20:04.090
They call it of course, doctors are very good
at giving names, our autonomic nervous system.

00:20:04.090 --> 00:20:05.570
Now who is this auto?

00:20:05.570 --> 00:20:06.970
Auto is the spirit.

00:20:06.970 --> 00:20:10.119
Auto is the spirit, they don't want to say
spirit.

00:20:10.119 --> 00:20:16.330
They don't want to use that word, but it means
that, otherwise tell us, who is the auto.

00:20:16.330 --> 00:20:22.440
This, one has to understand, that within us
this special instrument placed.

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:27.379
One after another these centers were created
at a different stage of our evolution.

00:20:27.379 --> 00:20:35.570
For example at the first red spot is the carbon
situation.

00:20:35.570 --> 00:20:41.169
Then as you started evolving more and more
these are the milestones within us.

00:20:41.169 --> 00:20:48.299
Specially created within us, this kundalini
is there, which is the pure desire of becoming

00:20:48.299 --> 00:20:49.840
one with the Divine.

00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:58.989
All other desires are absolutely not desires,
because if they were we would have been satisfied

00:20:58.989 --> 00:20:59.989
with them.

00:20:59.989 --> 00:21:03.239
Economics says that in general wants are not
satiable.

00:21:03.239 --> 00:21:06.580
So all our wants are something, unsatiable
stuffs.

00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:09.139
So why run after that?

00:21:09.139 --> 00:21:15.629
What is that desire which is going to really
make us satisfied is this desire, is the kundalini.

00:21:15.629 --> 00:21:22.360
So this exists within us, it is within us
this all has been made, specially.You are

00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:24.220
a special instrument.

00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:27.679
Now this instrument must be put to the mains.

00:21:27.679 --> 00:21:30.239
That's the only job.

00:21:30.239 --> 00:21:31.340
Then why deny it?

00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:34.489
Why should we deny this?

00:21:34.489 --> 00:21:41.750
Because we have become human beings with all
these things within us, so why not put it

00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:48.610
to the mains, and once you put it to the mains
you are amazed that your own instrument what

00:21:48.610 --> 00:21:49.610
you are.

00:21:49.610 --> 00:21:54.470
You don't know what you are, you think you're
just an ordinary person you see hobnobbing

00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:56.830
with other things of life?

00:21:56.830 --> 00:22:05.119
No, actually you are a special instrument,
made specially to enter into the Kingdom of

00:22:05.119 --> 00:22:06.119
God.

00:22:06.119 --> 00:22:14.609
But only thing is, when we are naive or when
we are ignorant, we don't understand our own

00:22:14.609 --> 00:22:20.399
value, like in the Indian village if you take,
say, a TV set and say that you can see all

00:22:20.399 --> 00:22:25.330
kinds of dramas and plays and music out of
this, they'll say, "What?

00:22:25.330 --> 00:22:27.960
This box how can it be?"

00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:31.289
Then you put it to the mains, he's aghast,
what's this magic?

00:22:31.289 --> 00:22:33.629
To him this is a magic.

00:22:33.629 --> 00:22:36.669
For some people raising the kundalini is magic.

00:22:36.669 --> 00:22:39.299
They always ask me how can it be so simple.

00:22:39.299 --> 00:22:40.860
It has to be simple.

00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:42.539
It is so vital.

00:22:42.539 --> 00:22:44.220
As when we breathe.

00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:45.341
What do we do?

00:22:45.341 --> 00:22:48.869
Do we go to any guru or do we read any book
or anything?

00:22:48.869 --> 00:22:52.210
If you had to do that, how many of us would
exist.

00:22:52.210 --> 00:22:56.019
Whatever is vital has to be simple.

00:22:56.019 --> 00:22:58.580
Whatever is living is simple.

00:22:58.580 --> 00:23:02.559
We don't know how many things we are blessed
with.

00:23:02.559 --> 00:23:08.739
The powers of God cannot be described, but
one can say that if you see, looking at things,

00:23:08.739 --> 00:23:15.159
see an Australian gets a child looks like
an Australian; Indian gets a child looks like

00:23:15.159 --> 00:23:16.770
an Indian, and also the face.

00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:23.080
And if you see to the microscopic way, how
it works out, how it develops, how the choices

00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:27.489
take place, is something a fantastic work.

00:23:27.489 --> 00:23:29.119
You cannot go into that.

00:23:29.119 --> 00:23:30.460
Is like an ocean.

00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:33.509
When you start seeing the reality, is like
an ocean.

00:23:33.509 --> 00:23:36.480
When you start discernng it, finding it out.

00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:37.740
It's too
much.

00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:42.059
So what is best to make your drop an ocean.

00:23:42.059 --> 00:23:44.099
Just to dissolve it into the ocean.

00:23:44.099 --> 00:23:46.850
Then people think that you have to surrender.

00:23:46.850 --> 00:23:48.279
You don't have to surrender.

00:23:48.279 --> 00:23:50.830
What is there to surrender?

00:23:50.830 --> 00:23:57.349
Only your ego, which has bound you, only your
superego which has bound you, has to be sucked

00:23:57.349 --> 00:23:58.349
in.

00:23:58.349 --> 00:24:03.379
Let the kundalini pass through and you become
one with the Divine.

00:24:03.379 --> 00:24:08.389
The problems of health are really shattering.

00:24:08.389 --> 00:24:14.210
I say we'll not be destroyed by atom bomb
because whatever human beings create they

00:24:14.210 --> 00:24:18.999
know what it is, like the atom bomb itself
has become a devil for them.

00:24:18.999 --> 00:24:20.509
They are all worried.

00:24:20.509 --> 00:24:25.129
The Americans are worried that if they start
it the Russians will destroy them, and the

00:24:25.129 --> 00:24:28.299
Russians are worried if they start it American
will destroy them.

00:24:28.299 --> 00:24:31.450
So let them be busy with each other.

00:24:31.450 --> 00:24:41.890
But they are not worried as to the real destruction
which is bubbling through.

00:24:41.890 --> 00:24:51.830
The destruction that is bubbling through in
America is not through atomic bomb, but through

00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:58.640
their own mental disturbances, extreme behaviours,
their "What's wrong?"

00:24:58.640 --> 00:24:59.640
business.

00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:01.860
Russia same thing.

00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:02.860
Why?

00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:06.700
The presidents are dying, what's the reason,
have you been able to find out?

00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:07.919
They are not murdered.

00:25:07.919 --> 00:25:09.679
In America, they're murdered.

00:25:09.679 --> 00:25:16.769
The reason, they are dealing in parapsychology,
they are dealing with all left-sided things.

00:25:16.769 --> 00:25:22.989
Because they're dealing with these, all these
spirits are getting hold of them.

00:25:22.989 --> 00:25:25.049
That's why they cannot go further.

00:25:25.049 --> 00:25:30.340
So in both ways they are not aware so to what
is going to destroy them.

00:25:30.340 --> 00:25:35.679
But as Australia is a neutral country, let's
see a neutral point of view, that we do not

00:25:35.679 --> 00:25:41.609
want to be destroyed by our stupidity, nor
by our foolhardiness, but let us have our

00:25:41.609 --> 00:25:48.360
own wisdom to underdstand how we construct
ourselves into human beings who will be wise

00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:49.360
people.

00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:56.539
Now specially for Australians, I have a special
feeling for them because this first red center

00:25:56.539 --> 00:26:00.169
is Australia, and this represents the innocence.

00:26:00.169 --> 00:26:05.779
So whatever Australians may try to destroy
their innocence, they cannot go very far because

00:26:05.779 --> 00:26:08.129
you have rooted into innocence.

00:26:08.129 --> 00:26:09.879
You are blessed with innocence.

00:26:09.879 --> 00:26:15.599
You cannot go too far and it's here it will
start, you will see one day, the wisdom, because

00:26:15.599 --> 00:26:18.570
this is the centre of wisdom too.

00:26:18.570 --> 00:26:25.889
This is the centre of as we call Shri Ganesha,
the deity of innocence, who is the giver of

00:26:25.889 --> 00:26:26.889
wisdom.

00:26:26.889 --> 00:26:33.039
So this wisdom to give balance in this nonsensical
world, which is busy fighting and not constructing

00:26:33.039 --> 00:26:39.830
themselves into better realms, will definitely
one day come through Australia, no doubt about

00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:40.830
it.

00:26:40.830 --> 00:26:48.840
But Australians also must put down both the
feet down on the ground and don't try to follow

00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:51.450
others, not try to copy others.

00:26:51.450 --> 00:26:58.889
If you have faith in yourself try to develop
your own wisdom and understand that you could

00:26:58.889 --> 00:27:04.529
one day do such a great thing that none of
these so called successful and great countries

00:27:04.529 --> 00:27:05.529
have been able to.

00:27:05.529 --> 00:27:12.639
It's all right to have dollar in a collapsable
state, you can have something else, but to

00:27:12.639 --> 00:27:18.019
have people who are wise, who are not going
to be deterred by nonsense, to create such

00:27:18.019 --> 00:27:20.169
people is possible in Australia.

00:27:20.169 --> 00:27:24.669
Though my visits to Australia have been few,
I should say only three times, this the third

00:27:24.669 --> 00:27:27.820
time here I am here.

00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:36.130
I wish I could come many more times, but My
own opinion is this, that I have been laboring

00:27:36.130 --> 00:27:41.749
in that England, which is the heart of universe,
for the last twelve years.

00:27:41.749 --> 00:27:48.539
I haven't achieved much as I have done it
here in only four years, is surprising.

00:27:48.539 --> 00:27:51.970
You must know your own nature, you must know
what you are.

00:27:51.970 --> 00:27:56.309
You are Australians and you have a special
wisdom about it.

00:27:56.309 --> 00:28:01.929
Take to that wisdom, understand that, respect
it, and work it out.

00:28:01.929 --> 00:28:08.529
I'm sure that will take no time for you to
understand that in your wisdom, you must become

00:28:08.529 --> 00:28:11.039
that instrument that you are.

00:28:11.039 --> 00:28:14.620
You have to become the spirit, that's what
are.

00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:21.609
You are not this temporary phase in which
you are indulging, you are not to destroy

00:28:21.609 --> 00:28:22.609
yourself.

00:28:22.609 --> 00:28:27.659
You're not to destroy your own progenies,
but you have to save the whole world out of

00:28:27.659 --> 00:28:31.049
this island of great people.

00:28:31.049 --> 00:28:35.339
So may God bless you.

00:28:35.339 --> 00:28:42.409
We take out our shoes to respect the Mother
Earth in a way, but also you must know that

00:28:42.409 --> 00:28:46.940
all these centers are made of different elements,
and specially the kundalini rests in the sacrum

00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:53.679
bone which is a sacred bone which means that
the Greeks knew about it, that it is a sacred

00:28:53.679 --> 00:28:56.029
bone and is made specially of the earth element.

00:28:56.029 --> 00:29:01.700
So one has to understand that we have to take
a special help from the Mother Earth and that's

00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:03.570
why I said Australia is something special
for us.

00:29:03.570 --> 00:29:07.399
Regarding questions also, just now we are
in a mood, you see, to get our realization,

00:29:07.399 --> 00:29:09.130
is better to keep the mood on.

00:29:09.130 --> 00:29:15.139
Questions, whatever you think, you can ask
Me tomorrow; but ask sensible questions, because

00:29:15.139 --> 00:29:23.460
you have to be constructive and wise and there's
no need to be aggressive with Me.

00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:38.889
The other day there was somebody who just
for nothing at all just got in a mood of shouting

00:29:38.889 --> 00:30:12.239
at Me, for what I don't know, I didn't even
hear him what he was talking.

00:30:12.239 --> 00:30:42.109
This is not 

00:30:42.109 --> 00:30:45.779
the way to behave.

00:30:45.779 --> 00:31:01.320
After all you all have this instrument.

00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:36.669
Now I 
have come here to give you what you have,

00:31:36.669 --> 00:31:42.609
your own properties.

00:31:42.609 --> 00:32:04.859
I'm just to hand over your own keys to you.

00:32:04.859 --> 00:32:11.469
What is there to fight with Me for that?

00:32:11.469 --> 00:32:14.320
Is it something sensible to do?

00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:16.429
But it happens.

00:32:16.429 --> 00:32:21.070
I don't know why it happens like that: with
some people go off their heads, they can't

00:32:21.070 --> 00:32:22.219
see things properly.

00:32:22.219 --> 00:32:28.609
Whatever it is you please write down all your
questions and hand them over and I'll answer

00:32:28.609 --> 00:32:32.499
them tomorrow if specifically possible, otherwise
in My lectures.

00:32:32.499 --> 00:32:41.029
I'm here only for two days, that is today
and tomorrow, so you must take full advantage

00:32:41.029 --> 00:32:46.049
of Me, I think, whatever is possible than
to waste your time here and there.

00:32:46.049 --> 00:32:52.380
Now we have a very simple method of raising
our kundalini.

00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:58.279
So what do we do first day is to raise our
own kundalini.

00:32:58.279 --> 00:33:07.659
We put the left hand on the lap like this,
which is the side which we call is the power

00:33:07.659 --> 00:33:14.970
of desire, on the lap just like this, towards
Me, just like, simple, like that on the lap

00:33:14.970 --> 00:33:16.209
very comfortably.

00:33:16.209 --> 00:33:20.820
Sit comfortably, there's no need to push back
your head much or bend down, nothing keep

00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:23.629
it absolutely normal.

00:33:23.629 --> 00:33:26.009
Actually you have to lead a very normal life.

00:33:26.009 --> 00:33:28.739
Somebody asked Me, "You have to be celibate
and all that?"

00:33:28.739 --> 00:33:29.739
Nothing of the kind.

00:33:29.739 --> 00:33:34.250
You have to be married, very happily married,
you have to have children, and you will know

00:33:34.250 --> 00:33:39.590
how to lead a very sane, sensible married
life, and how to look after your children,

00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:44.499
and you will have children who are great sages.

00:33:44.499 --> 00:33:49.960
So I would suggest that you shouldn't have
all these ideas that you have to do this or

00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:55.899
anything, as you are sitting you will get
your realization and then you will have just

00:33:55.899 --> 00:34:02.440
to find out what problems you have, what exercise
you may have to do if you have a very bad

00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:04.179
problem of some physical side.

00:34:04.179 --> 00:34:12.549
If you have any problem, say of mental side,
or any other problem of family life or anything,

00:34:12.549 --> 00:34:18.849
they will tell you the method, the technique,
how through your spiritual powers you can

00:34:18.849 --> 00:34:20.470
solve them.

00:34:20.470 --> 00:34:24.619
So we have to have our own kundalini awakened.

00:34:24.619 --> 00:34:27.710
Put left hand towards Me.

00:34:27.710 --> 00:34:34.250
Now the right hand has to go on different
centers on the left hand side of your body,

00:34:34.250 --> 00:34:35.409
on the left hand side.

00:34:35.409 --> 00:34:38.330
Now the right hand is the power of action.

00:34:38.330 --> 00:34:43.990
This is our hand we have to use because I
said you are fantastic and the fact is, the

00:34:43.990 --> 00:34:47.980
greatest thing is that you can get your kundalini
awakened this way.

00:34:47.980 --> 00:34:57.149
So put your left hand towards Me on the lap,
very comfortably you sit down, and the right

00:34:57.149 --> 00:34:59.930
hand you have to use for the different centers.

00:34:59.930 --> 00:35:03.950
I show you which ones, and then I'll tell
you later on when you close your eyes.

00:35:03.950 --> 00:35:12.579
So I want to tell you first, on the heart,
then on the upper part of the stomach, then

00:35:12.579 --> 00:35:19.630
in the lower part of the stomach, then again
back on the upper part of the stomach, all

00:35:19.630 --> 00:35:26.779
on the left hand side, then on the heart,
then on the neck, here, little on the back

00:35:26.779 --> 00:35:33.950
side, goes here, is very important just now
this is the worst of all, because when you

00:35:33.950 --> 00:35:36.630
feel guilty this catches.

00:35:36.630 --> 00:35:42.849
Now one here [front agnya], then here [back
agnya], and then here [fontanelle], but I'll

00:35:42.849 --> 00:35:45.970
tell you every time where you have to put
it.

00:35:45.970 --> 00:35:54.440
At the very outset I have to request you that
you should tell yourself very clearly that

00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:57.150
"I'm not guilty at all of anything."

00:35:57.150 --> 00:36:00.430
Forgive yourself, that's very important.

00:36:00.430 --> 00:36:07.180
I said you are the temple of God, you are
a special category.

00:36:07.180 --> 00:36:11.119
Why do you want to debase yourself by feeling
guilty?

00:36:11.119 --> 00:36:17.220
In My lecture if I've said something, forget
it.

00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:25.819
Just tell yourself that "I'm not at all guilty"
very clearly with all confidence, that's one

00:36:25.819 --> 00:36:31.089
of the things you have to do.

00:36:31.089 --> 00:36:32.910
All right.

00:36:32.910 --> 00:36:42.420
Now, we close our eyes and we don't open our
eyes till I tell you.

00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:48.930
Don't open your eyes till I tell you because
the kundalini has to rise.

00:36:48.930 --> 00:36:49.930
Everyone must do it.

00:36:49.930 --> 00:36:52.700
Those who don't want to do it should please
go away.

00:36:52.700 --> 00:36:56.680
Please be civil, don't do it, please go away.

00:36:56.680 --> 00:37:03.920
Nobody can force this on you and this is no
show on, so please go away.

00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:08.820
Secondly, those who are doing meditation should
sit till you get your realization.

00:37:08.820 --> 00:37:12.220
It will not take much time, about fifteen
minutes at the most.

00:37:12.220 --> 00:37:20.080
But some people have a habit of suddenly shooting
off like jack-in-the-box and disturbing others.

00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:22.549
So you have to be pleasant about it.

00:37:22.549 --> 00:37:24.280
You have to be pleasant, it's nothing serious.

00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:27.789
You are going to enter into the kingdom of
God, you are invited.

00:37:27.789 --> 00:37:36.519
There is an invitation, so be pleasant about
it and I'm sure it will work out.

00:37:36.519 --> 00:37:44.792
Now, please close your eyes and the doubting
Thomas, you put him outside for the time being.

00:37:44.792 --> 00:37:47.349
The doubting Thomas is not going to help you.

00:37:47.349 --> 00:37:48.950
Just don't doubt yourself.

00:37:48.950 --> 00:37:56.010
You are quite capable of getting realization,
all of you are quite capable of getting realization,

00:37:56.010 --> 00:37:58.230
believe Me, there.

00:37:58.230 --> 00:38:05.200
Now please put your right [hand], with all
your respect to your person, on your heart.

00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:09.150
In the heart resides the Spirit.

00:38:09.150 --> 00:38:17.039
So you ask Me a question, without feeling
guilty, with full confidence, a question to

00:38:17.039 --> 00:38:23.790
be asked in your heart, you can call Me Shri
Mataji, or Mother, whatever suits you, "Mother,

00:38:23.790 --> 00:38:26.160
am I the spirit?".

00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:32.300
Ask the question three times because you are
like a computer and the answer comes to you

00:38:32.300 --> 00:38:33.300
as vibrations.

00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:35.750
Ask the question three times.

00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:36.750
Believing in yourself.

00:38:36.750 --> 00:38:41.309
"Mother, am I the spirit?"

00:38:41.309 --> 00:38:48.700
Regarding feet I must tell you, you must sit
in a way the feet are parallel but not touching

00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:51.400
each other, but touching the Mother Earth.

00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:57.849
They should be parallel to each other, sit
in such a way that they are parallel, touching

00:38:57.849 --> 00:39:00.670
the Mother Earth.

00:39:00.670 --> 00:39:04.090
Not touching each other.

00:39:04.090 --> 00:39:17.539
Ask a question, please ask a question three
times, "Mother, am I the spirit?"

00:39:17.539 --> 00:39:33.260
Please don't feel guilty.

00:39:33.260 --> 00:39:42.160
This question is followed by another question
that if you are the spirit, you are your own

00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:47.790
guide, you are your own guru, you are your
own master.

00:39:47.790 --> 00:39:55.809
So now, please take this right hand down on
the left hand side on the upper part of your

00:39:55.809 --> 00:39:57.029
stomach.

00:39:57.029 --> 00:40:03.170
Now slowly press it there.

00:40:03.170 --> 00:40:06.970
Don't say any mantras, don't chant anything,
nothing of the kind, just don't force your

00:40:06.970 --> 00:40:09.990
mind to do anything, it will happen automatically.

00:40:09.990 --> 00:40:19.059
Now at this point, you have to ask another
question to Me three times, "Mother, am I

00:40:19.059 --> 00:40:20.369
my own guru?

00:40:20.369 --> 00:40:22.970
Mother, am I my own master.

00:40:22.970 --> 00:40:34.920
Mother, am I my own guide?"

00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:45.130
All right.

00:40:45.130 --> 00:41:09.250
Now you take down your hand on the lower part
of your abdomen, your stomach, in the left

00:41:09.250 --> 00:41:12.640
hand side, and push it there.

00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:22.119
This center is very important, because this
is the beginning of asking for the true knowledge,

00:41:22.119 --> 00:41:30.299
for the technique, how to maneuver this power
of God's love.

00:41:30.299 --> 00:41:34.300
So here I cannot cross your freedom.

00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:39.349
You have to say that you want the true knowledge,
the pure knowledge.

00:41:39.349 --> 00:41:47.759
So please say six times, because there are
six petals to this chakra, "Mother, may I

00:41:47.759 --> 00:41:49.500
have the true knowledge?"

00:41:49.500 --> 00:41:56.539
or "Mother, please give me the pure knowledge."

00:41:56.539 --> 00:42:05.569
Six times please.

00:42:05.569 --> 00:42:20.609
Please don't get up halfway.

00:42:20.609 --> 00:42:27.990
It's not proper to disturb others.

00:42:27.990 --> 00:42:38.420
Please be seated, please be seated.

00:42:38.420 --> 00:42:46.980
Now take this hand again back to the center
of the guru principle, that is in the upper

00:42:46.980 --> 00:42:51.560
part of your abdomen.

00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:57.869
On the left hand side, in the upper part of
the abdomen, on the left hand side.

00:42:57.869 --> 00:43:02.559
Now as you have asked for your true technique,
the kundalini has started moving.

00:43:02.559 --> 00:43:14.019
To give her a proper cooperation, now you
have to say, with full confidence, with full

00:43:14.019 --> 00:43:20.150
assertion, "Mother, I am my own master.

00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:23.680
Mother, I am my own guide.

00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:27.049
Mother I am my own guru."

00:43:27.049 --> 00:43:29.230
Please say this.

00:43:29.230 --> 00:43:34.470
When you say this, the kundalini will rise
higher.

00:43:34.470 --> 00:43:45.590
At this point you have to say ten times.

00:43:45.590 --> 00:44:04.990
As I said there are ten valencies, ten guru
principles, within us.

00:44:04.990 --> 00:44:09.680
You shouldn't have any fear, any fear whatsoever,
about kundalini.

00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:16.150
This kundalini is your mother and she is going
to bear all the brunt upon herself to give

00:44:16.150 --> 00:44:19.759
you this realization, because this she has
been waiting for ages.

00:44:19.759 --> 00:44:21.190
You are not going to be troubled at all.

00:44:21.190 --> 00:44:25.250
There is not going to be any trouble whatsoever.

00:44:25.250 --> 00:44:35.609
So now what we have, please close your eyes,
now what we have to do is to put this hand

00:44:35.609 --> 00:44:42.519
on the heart again, back on the heart, left
hand towards Me and right hand on the heart.

00:44:42.519 --> 00:44:44.990
Take out your shoes please.

00:44:44.990 --> 00:44:49.420
Put your left hand towards Me and right hand
on the heart.

00:44:49.420 --> 00:44:52.680
Take out your spectacles, please.

00:44:52.680 --> 00:44:55.940
Now keep your eyes shut.

00:44:55.940 --> 00:45:06.670
At this point you have to say, assert with
full confidence in you, "Mother, "I am the

00:45:06.670 --> 00:45:12.270
spirit", you are the spirit.

00:45:12.270 --> 00:45:20.490
All right.

00:45:20.490 --> 00:45:39.609
Say twelve times "Mother, I am the spirit."

00:45:39.609 --> 00:45:52.720
Now you have to know that God is the ocean
of compassion, ocean of Divine love, ocean

00:45:52.720 --> 00:45:55.619
of grace, bliss, joy, everything.

00:45:55.619 --> 00:46:03.440
Apart from that He is the ocean of forgiveness.

00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:14.900
Whatever you might have done He is the ocean,
everything engulfs, dissolves into His ocean

00:46:14.900 --> 00:46:17.779
of forgiveness.

00:46:17.779 --> 00:46:27.779
So please forgive yourself first of all, and
now raise your right hand in the corner of

00:46:27.779 --> 00:46:30.250
your neck and the shoulder.

00:46:30.250 --> 00:46:31.430
Little backwards.

00:46:31.430 --> 00:46:34.970
This is the center you catch.

00:46:34.970 --> 00:46:39.450
This is the center you catch when you feel
guilty.

00:46:39.450 --> 00:46:45.410
So now please say with full understanding
about yourself.

00:46:45.410 --> 00:46:53.740
Please put the hand from the front on the
chest you put it, not backwards, put it from

00:46:53.740 --> 00:46:59.700
the, on the chest, the hand on the chest and
then put it down, otherwise it will pain.

00:46:59.700 --> 00:47:00.700
Yes.

00:47:00.700 --> 00:47:11.990
Now press it hard, press it hard, and here
you say sixteen times, with all faith in yourself,

00:47:11.990 --> 00:47:14.000
"Mother, I am not guilty."

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:17.970
Say it sixteen times, "Mother, I am not guilty."

00:47:17.970 --> 00:47:22.650
You have to be pleasant, you have to be happy,
you have to be joyous.

00:47:22.650 --> 00:47:25.260
Not to feel guilty and miserable.

00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:30.010
Please say, "Mother, I am not guilty at all."

00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:31.010
That will really help.

00:47:31.010 --> 00:47:36.099
This the worst center you have today, worst,
is very painful, please say, "Mother, I'm

00:47:36.099 --> 00:47:37.119
not guilty."

00:47:37.119 --> 00:47:44.579
If you still believe that you are guilty of
doing something wrong for nothing at all,

00:47:44.579 --> 00:47:49.490
I would say better get a punishment of saying
hundred and eight times.

00:47:49.490 --> 00:47:52.050
That will release you of your worries, of
feeling guilty.

00:47:52.050 --> 00:48:04.249
What do you do about it, it's a myth to feel
that way, isn't it?

00:48:04.249 --> 00:48:09.670
Ah, better.

00:48:09.670 --> 00:48:36.690
So now please say it sixteen times, "Mother,
I am not guilty."

00:48:36.690 --> 00:48:47.130
Now raise this hand on your forehead across,
across and hold it tight and press it hard,

00:48:47.130 --> 00:48:55.369
as if when you have headache, you press it
the same way.

00:48:55.369 --> 00:49:03.200
At this point you have to say, is the mantra
for this center, is, that "Mother, I forgive

00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:08.099
everyone, Mother, I forgive everyone."

00:49:08.099 --> 00:49:12.349
Now many people think that is very diffiult
to say, actually it's a myth, it's a myth

00:49:12.349 --> 00:49:19.160
because we do not do anything whether we forgive
or we do not forgive.

00:49:19.160 --> 00:49:25.440
But if we do not forgive others we play into
the hand of others.

00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:30.170
So please say, "Mother, I forgive everyone",
from your heart.

00:49:30.170 --> 00:49:34.210
How many times is not the point.

00:49:34.210 --> 00:49:47.720
From your heart please say, "Mother, I forgive
everyone."

00:49:47.720 --> 00:49:52.230
From your heart.

00:49:52.230 --> 00:50:05.190
Now take your hand on the backside of your
head, backside, on the optic lobe, hold it

00:50:05.190 --> 00:50:06.420
tight.

00:50:06.420 --> 00:50:14.279
Here because you feel so guilty please say,
once and for all, "Oh Lord, if I have done

00:50:14.279 --> 00:50:21.130
anything in the glory of Divine which is wrong,
please forgive me."

00:50:21.130 --> 00:50:35.240
Just once with full understanding and heart,
please say that, "Forgive me.

00:50:35.240 --> 00:50:48.509
If I have done anything wrong, please forgive
me."

00:50:48.509 --> 00:50:53.390
All right.

00:50:53.390 --> 00:51:04.339
Now take this hand on top of your head, and
put your palm on top of your head and press

00:51:04.339 --> 00:51:10.630
it hard and move it clockwise, on the area
that was soft in your childhood.

00:51:10.630 --> 00:51:13.720
Press it hard and move it.

00:51:13.720 --> 00:51:42.140
Your palm, palm, not fingers, and move it
clockwise.

00:51:42.140 --> 00:52:28.660
[Shri Mataji gives the cool breeze through
the microphone.]

00:52:28.660 --> 00:52:35.589
Now please take down your hand, slowly, take
down your hand on your lap, right hand.

00:52:35.589 --> 00:52:37.940
Now open your eyes.

00:52:37.940 --> 00:52:42.059
Slowly, very slowly.

00:52:42.059 --> 00:52:46.290
Now watch Me without thinking, watch Me without
thinking.

00:52:46.290 --> 00:52:51.650
Though there is air conditioning, you'll find
the cool breeze coming out of your head.

00:52:51.650 --> 00:52:58.079
If you put your right hand towards Me and
left hand on top of your head.

00:52:58.079 --> 00:53:02.619
See, now is there cool breeze coming?

00:53:02.619 --> 00:53:04.260
Little higher.

00:53:04.260 --> 00:53:14.220
It's a very very subtle thing, don't doubt
it, little here, little here, please take.

00:53:14.220 --> 00:53:24.130
Put right hand towards Me, little raise the
right hand maybe, hmm, good.

00:53:24.130 --> 00:53:29.940
Move it like that and see, just see for yourself.

00:53:29.940 --> 00:53:33.420
Move it little bit, see now.

00:53:33.420 --> 00:53:37.849
There is the cool breeze, not the breeze from
top.

00:53:37.849 --> 00:53:43.900
Don't doubt it, because this is the breeze
which will enpower you to cure others, to

00:53:43.900 --> 00:53:47.460
cure yourself, so it's not the airconditioner,
just see this.

00:53:47.460 --> 00:53:50.200
Now, all right, quite a blast.

00:53:50.200 --> 00:54:02.539
Now you put back the other hand toward Me,
now, again see the 

00:54:02.539 --> 00:54:03.539
right hand, left hand towards Me.

00:54:03.539 --> 00:54:08.380
With the right hand you see, right hand you
see, left hand towards Me and with the right

00:54:08.380 --> 00:54:09.630
hand you see.

00:54:09.630 --> 00:54:14.020
Enjoying so much, just see it's a miracle,
that's the real thing that you can't do.

00:54:14.020 --> 00:54:18.480
You can jump, you can change your clothes,
cut your hair, cut your nose, do everything,

00:54:18.480 --> 00:54:22.390
but you cannot get this cool breeze out of
your head.

00:54:22.390 --> 00:54:24.321
This is the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost.

00:54:24.321 --> 00:54:28.019
Holy Ghost is within us, reflected as the
kundalini.

00:54:28.019 --> 00:54:33.200
See now, raise it higher, it's good.

00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:36.160
It's there, it's there.

00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:39.289
Now put both the hands towards Me.

00:54:39.289 --> 00:54:42.260
See if the cool breeze is coming in the hand.

00:54:42.260 --> 00:54:47.309
Should, but if it is not, we'll try something
else, and don't think.

00:54:47.309 --> 00:54:49.859
It did not happen with thinking.

00:54:49.859 --> 00:54:53.269
Now put your hands like that.

00:54:53.269 --> 00:54:59.160
Now you can push both your hands like this
towards the sky.

00:54:59.160 --> 00:55:04.730
Push back your neck also like this and ask
a question, "Mother, is this the breeze of

00:55:04.730 --> 00:55:06.069
the Holy Ghost?

00:55:06.069 --> 00:55:09.380
Mother, is this the all-pervading power of
God?

00:55:09.380 --> 00:55:12.950
Mother is this the Brahma?"

00:55:12.950 --> 00:55:16.920
Ask a question, push back your head.

00:55:16.920 --> 00:55:21.549
Push back your head, and just ask.

00:55:21.549 --> 00:55:24.690
Now you're feeling the air conditioner, but
actually also you are feeling this breeze.

00:55:24.690 --> 00:55:27.089
Put your hands towards Me.

00:55:27.089 --> 00:55:32.359
Now see, you'll feel the breeze coming from
Me.

00:55:32.359 --> 00:55:36.369
All right?

00:55:36.369 --> 00:55:45.150
Now take it down, see in your hands, are you
feeling the cool breeze?

00:55:45.150 --> 00:55:48.279
Yes, there it is.

00:55:48.279 --> 00:55:55.059
One more thing we have to do now we have got
our realization.

00:55:55.059 --> 00:55:56.980
Most of us have felt it.

00:55:56.980 --> 00:56:02.170
Those who have not felt it, doesn't matter,
because of this center sometimes you do not

00:56:02.170 --> 00:56:06.780
feel it, doesn't matter, but tomorrow again
you have to come and I'll establish it.

00:56:06.780 --> 00:56:10.250
The one thing we have to do is protect ourselves.

00:56:10.250 --> 00:56:13.680
Before we go out.

00:56:13.680 --> 00:56:18.089
Tomorrow also before going out of the house
you protect yourself, in the night you protect

00:56:18.089 --> 00:56:21.849
yourself, very simple, because now the power
is flowing through your hands.

00:56:21.849 --> 00:56:26.570
Now what you do is to put left hand towards
Me like this, or when in the house just like

00:56:26.570 --> 00:56:27.570
this.

00:56:27.570 --> 00:56:32.280
Now with the right hand you have to protect
your auras so no negative forces can trouble

00:56:32.280 --> 00:56:33.280
you.

00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:36.849
So what you do is to raise from here to the
top of your head.

00:56:36.849 --> 00:56:39.680
Let's do seven times to seven chakras.

00:56:39.680 --> 00:56:42.170
One, everybody should do it.

00:56:42.170 --> 00:56:52.960
I don't want you to be caught up again, is
two, and everybody, whether you got realization

00:56:52.960 --> 00:57:04.779
or not, is, three, again, is, four, five,
six, and is seven.

00:57:04.779 --> 00:57:08.760
Now the last thing I have to tell you is how
to raise your own kundalini.

00:57:08.760 --> 00:57:13.769
You have to put this hand, I am showing now
only, before your kundalini and move your

00:57:13.769 --> 00:57:21.559
hand in such a way that it is first above,
front, lower and back, it's like that.

00:57:21.559 --> 00:57:26.270
Put the left hand straight, moving like that,
and this has to move like that, clockwise.

00:57:26.270 --> 00:57:35.369
Now let's put it nearer the kundalini, lower,
lower, now start moving it, that's how it

00:57:35.369 --> 00:57:39.249
moves, the hand, one hand, moves straight,
another goes round it.

00:57:39.249 --> 00:57:41.029
Now the kundalini is up.

00:57:41.029 --> 00:57:46.539
Now make your shoulders loose, put your head
back, and give it a twist, now you have tying

00:57:46.539 --> 00:57:48.569
the kundalini up there.

00:57:48.569 --> 00:57:51.039
Let's do second time again.

00:57:51.039 --> 00:57:52.230
This is how you do it.

00:57:52.230 --> 00:57:54.920
Three times, again you raise it.

00:57:54.920 --> 00:57:55.920
Now you see it.

00:57:55.920 --> 00:58:01.480
The left hand will move much faster, now you
push back your head, push back your shoulders,

00:58:01.480 --> 00:58:03.700
and just give it a second twist.

00:58:03.700 --> 00:58:12.539
Third time you have to give it three knots,
so again please raise it higher, push back

00:58:12.539 --> 00:58:23.210
your head, give it one twist, then the second
twist, and the third one with a big knot.

00:58:23.210 --> 00:58:25.220
Now feel it in your hands.

00:58:25.220 --> 00:58:27.730
See now, the instrument will work better.

00:58:27.730 --> 00:58:32.470
Like you see we have made our connections
better.

00:58:32.470 --> 00:58:35.060
Right, that's it.

00:58:35.060 --> 00:58:36.980
Now feel this experience.

00:58:36.980 --> 00:58:39.400
This is the experience of the spirit.

00:58:39.400 --> 00:58:40.920
Now what to do about it.

00:58:40.920 --> 00:58:43.150
How to work it out, all those things...

00:58:43.150 --> 00:58:44.269
May God bless you.
