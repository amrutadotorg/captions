00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.300
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.740
Yesterday we talked about

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:24.000
the power that lies within us which is the power of the Holy Ghost

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.480
and which has to give us the Self-realization.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.740
Now, one may say that we have never heard about such a thing,

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:44.060
it's a very new idea but this is the knowledge of the roots.

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.380
In the West we have the knowledge of the tree

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:58.520
and somebody must also have the knowledge of the roots - there's nothing objectionable about it.

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:06.740
Like in the East people learnt about Science and other knowledge

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:15.220
that the Western people gathered, in the same way, when this tree of life grew so big

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:22.500
there was a search inside as well and when that search started, they in their meditative

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:30.120
processes, they found out that within us lies the power which can give us Self-realization.

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:36.760
But this very, very ancient discovery - this is nothing new that I'm telling you.

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.920
Only thing is that today the time has come, the blossom time has come,

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.680
that many can get Self-realization.

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.960
But Self-realization history is very, very ancient

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.200
that it is said that about 16000 years back

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:04.800
the king of all the Gods, called Indra, got his realization. I don't know in Greeks,

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:12.100
Greek language what He is called as but He is the one, who got his realization in a place called Chidendra

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.960
means, He was made, the hole was made into His head - Chidendra.

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:25.900
So this knowledge existed in our country since centuries because people had

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:34.560
more meditative temperament. Now this meditative temperament comes because they did not have to fight the Nature so much.

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:40.920
As you know, the climate in India is quite good, people can go outside

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:46.400
there's no problem of too much heat or uh.. too much uh.. wind -

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:52.960
it is easy to live outside and that's how people didn't fight much of the Nature.

00:03:53.520 --> 00:04:00.200
Because of the fighting with the Nature, the reaction created this

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:05.860
enthusiasm of the Western people to find out something about the Nature

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:13.660
and that's how we discovered all the Science and all the discoveries which we are enjoying but

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.940
whatever we have discovered so far, is a part of the same.

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:26.900
If you do not discover say, all these instruments, you cannot today talk to people,

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:33.640
you cannot propagate what is important, you cannot achieve

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:41.900
the Spiritual ascent en-masse, you cannot give it to thousands of people unless and until you have some means to do it.

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:49.340
So, even these discoveries are just complementary to the discoveries about the Self.

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:57.440
The Kundalini has been described by many people

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:03.160
but specially, I would mention, Markandeya who lived about 14000 years back.

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:09.400
He described this Kundalini, about which I told you yesterday, which resides in the triangular bone

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:15.120
and I told you that even the Greeks called it a Sacrum bone, meaning a sacred bone.

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:21.260
Now the word sacredness, holiness - all these are becoming sort of out of date

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:26.720
but there's a fact, there is something that is Holy, something that is Sacred.

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:33.440
Now what is this sacredness is, what is this Holiness is, it is rather difficult

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:41.560
for us to know because we deal with matter and matter doesn't talk about these things. At the most, if you go on

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:49.660
with the matter, you go on analysing it one after another and we reach analysis of everything disintegrating

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:55.100
the other parts. Like Medical Science now few

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:59.780
start studying the human body through Medical Science, which I also studied.

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:07.260
You go on analysing it. Ultimately, you reach a point uh.. where you will find a doctor -

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:13.220
one doctor for one eye another doctor for another eye - there's no synthesis but

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:21.000
when you go to the roots, it is the synthesis of all the uh.. nature, of all the characters of a trade.

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:25.500
So this is the difference between the approach of one to another.

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:31.940
Now this knowledge was not written down

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:39.220
was told to people, communicated to very few people and that's how it was passed on

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:46.960
from people to people. In the earlier days, they tried only on one or two persons whether they could get realization.

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:55.040
At the time of Rama, his father-in-law was the person who was quite deft uh.. in

00:06:55.300 --> 00:07:01.720
giving realization but he gave realization to one person called Nachiketa. So you can imagine

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:09.100
that how difficult it was to give realization to one person. First they had to cleanse a person, then

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:16.900
tell him to lead a very austere life, a life of balance - all kinds of things were done and then the Kundalini was

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:22.180
made to rise. That too one by one, every center it used to rise

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:29.440
and then they would see that it was established. For that they had to lead a very secluded life

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:36.040
and it was worked out when the children were about, say, twelve years of age

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:41.660
to about twenty-five years, in complete celibate life.

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:47.200
But now, as the time has come, as I told you, that blossom time has come.

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:54.720
But one must know that those who are sitting here, have gone through it - it is not a new thing that you have come here,

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:59.980
you're already ready for it and that's how you are going to get it. Only in this life time,

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:07.120
in these modern times, we have committed some mistakes because we were cut off from this,

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:12.160
cut off from the knowledge of the roots and suddenly we became modern

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:19.040
and in this modernism, we started understanding everything through our mental projections.

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:23.500
Now mental projection can be very mythical. Supposing, I project My mind

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:30.120
and I say that, ' I am just now sitting in New York, I'm feeling like this and that,' - it's just a mental projection.

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:37.140
Whatever we do has to be real but mostly mental projections are mythical

00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:43.460
and many people have done that and have been successful in life, so called, they have made lots of money,

00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:50.060
they have put their mental projections to this, mental projections to that and said, "This is knowledge, this is knowledge, this is knowledge."

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:56.300
And how are we to make out whether this is true or not? Is there any Absolute method

00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:59.500
by which we can make out whether this is true or not?

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:09.100
The reason is, the Absolute is nowhere to be seen, it's the relative life in which we live.

00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:15.280
Now the words like Holiness or the words like Sacredness and Auspiciousness,

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:21.120
have lost their value because we have lost the sense of that knowledge, that sensitivity.

00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:29.300
As I told you yesterday that I went to Rome and the mayor there just seeing My photograph, just

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:37.280
said, "Oh, this is Divinity!" and he helped us so much but the thing that has acted in him, is that sensitive

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:43.080
temperament which he, they have retained somehow or the other or it existed within him.

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:51.800
But we have to understand that every matter has a kind of a

00:09:53.360 --> 00:10:00.760
coefficience by which it can tell you whether it is sacred or not, which is Holy or not.

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:08.840
Like in India, we say that this place is Holy. Now how do we say this is a Holy place,

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:16.040
how do we understand this is a Holy place? Because a person who is a realized soul, who

00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:23.240
may not be a rich man, he may be a poor man, he might be just a ascetic, he may be a married man but a realized soul

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:29.420
is a category, is a state of mind, if he has, he can feel the

00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:36.380
Divine vibrations from that place and can say, "O, this is a Holy place." I'll give you an instance.

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:44.720
In Rahuri is a place uh.. uh.. called as Musalwadi and that place they have got a huge, big lake

00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:49.020
and that lake was uh.. to be

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:54.140
put into proper channel so they thought, make a big [UNCLEAR - BUNK OR BUND?]  on it.

00:10:54.560 --> 00:11:00.800
So they tried to make - an Englishman. It is about 50 - 60 years back an English engineer tried to make a bund there

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:07.640
and at a point he found he could not build anything. The thing that he build used to fall down,

00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:13.520
again he used to build something, used to fall down; So he was surprised. Then one

00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:20.580
Muslim fakir, as we call them - a realized soul came that way, he said, "Oh, this you leave it, this is a Holy place,

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:25.760
you cannot do anything, you better leave it alone." So they went round that place.

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:30.500
Can you imagine a bund going uh.. straight like this and the place is like that!

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:36.600
So when I went to that place they asked Me, "Mother, we would like You to see if it is a Holy place."

00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:42.320
I took some of the sahaja yogies who are sitting here and when we went there

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:47.940
we found it was emitting cool breeze from that place. You could feel it, all of us could feel it.

00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:54.400
Now, it is something, a miracle for people to think that how this can give cool breeze.

00:11:54.820 --> 00:12:02.320
Now as you know that the Spiritual touch of anything

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:10.340
starts emitting vibrations. There's another example I'll give you when

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:15.280
I went to Kashmir once and we were driving along a road

00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:21.100
and I just felt tremendous vibrations coming from somewhere so I asked the driver, I said,

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:26.640
"Is there a temple here or something?" He said, "No, it's all wilderness. I said, "Alright,

00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:34.400
uh.. let's go the way the vibrations are coming." So we went to a place of complete wilderness and passed through that and

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:42.240
then we saw some poor people living there, some Muslims so I asked them, "Is there any temple here?" They said, "No, we don't have

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:48.060
but we have a mosque ahead." I said, "What mosque is that?" They said, "This is Hazratbal."

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:53.480
I said, "Hazratbal?" They said, "There's one hair of Mohammad Sahab kept there."

00:12:53.920 --> 00:13:00.780
I caught it about five, seven miles away from there so we went and we saw. I saw it was there

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:05.900
because it was emitting vibrations - of course we couldn't see the hair because hair was kept inside.

00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:10.440
Now this is the thing we have been told even in the Bible

00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:17.120
that whatever is created by Mother Earth or by the sky, is not to be reproduced and worshipped.

00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:22.420
Now we must think what is created by the Mother Earth? We never think on those lines,

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:28.520
we just accept whatever people give us the interpretation but let us think what is created by the Mother Earth.

00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:35.760
This is what are the Holy places created by Mother Earth. Say, for example, Stonehenge that you have here.

00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:40.660
Perhaps you do not know it's a Holy thing. All these stones have come out of the Mother Earth,

00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:45.500
then some stupid people must have taken it out [UNCLEAR - HUNED?] it up put these things but

00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:50.620
actually the stones that have come out, are really the stones that have come out of the Mother Earth.

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:57.660
If you go there and see, it has vibrations. Not only that but it is made in the way, same way as this Kundalini is.

00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:04.300
So you had, on this island, some people who knew the knowledge of the Divine.

00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:10.580
They definitely knew otherwise how is it they went round and made a circular thing like that

00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:17.600
and they even now go, these tourists go and worship them but they don't know what they're doing, they have no idea what they are doing.

00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:24.100
As I told you yesterday, like Mohammad Sahab has told you how to do namaz but the Muslims don't know why to do namaz,

00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:29.900
what does that mean, what all these things mean, what Allah-ho-Akbar means - they just do it because they're told.

00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:38.220
So there's a gap between what we're told and the gap between what it is but there is a coefficience

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:45.040
of Divinity in a thing. Unless and until you become the Spirit, you cannot feel it.

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:52.320
Like the magnet can feel the magnetism, in the same way, you have to become that which can feel all those

00:14:52.640 --> 00:15:00.160
beautiful things which we call as the Divine vibrations. Now, the Divine vibration flows within us

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:07.520
when we get our Self-realization. Before that we are cut off from our Spirit.

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:15.660
The Spirit resides in our heart and we are, our attention is not enlightened by that Spirit.

00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:20.480
The Spirit watches us like a witness, it watches us,

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:28.440
sees how we behave, where we go, what we do, everything is just watching - it's a spectator. That's the situation is of God also,

00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:36.620
God Almighty is watching the play, is watching the play of His power which we call as the Holy Ghost.

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:43.200
Holy Ghost is the power or we can say, is the Mother who, who has created the whole world,

00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:50.380
who has created the whole Universe and is showing the play to one spectator that is the God Almighty

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:58.000
and He is watching all that play and when He's watching all that play, He wants to enjoy it -

00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:04.640
the moment He doesn't like it He can destroy it. In the same way within ourselves resides

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:11.260
this Spirit which watches us and sees what we are up to, what we do. But the Kundalini,

00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:18.340
this one, which is the Holy Ghost, the reflection of the Holy Ghost which resides in the triangular bone, records everything that we do.

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:25.720
It's just like a tape-recorder. It records what we do, what have been our hankering, where have we been, what we have been doing.

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:33.000
It's a subtler knowledge; For that we have to extend ourselves and understand that at the human level

00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:39.120
you can only go into four dimensions at the most but the fourth one is also in the thinking.

00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:46.800
Three dimensions actually exist for you but the fourth dimension is in your thinking -

00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:53.400
you have imagined, you have listened to people, you have been told by people, it has been

00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:59.860
uh..described to you but it is not part and parcel of your being - is just you know as there -

00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:05.700
it's something else, is not yourself. Now this fourth dimension you have to achieve.

00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:13.660
So to know this fourth dimension there has to be some arrangement within us, if we are created for that.

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:20.920
If we have to become the fourth dimension, there must be some arrangement within us and this is the arrangement we have got of

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:26.940
uh.. our subtle being which remains working

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:33.960
as Parasympathetic Nervous System. Now this Parasympathetic Nervous System is a system within us

00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:41.960
which nourishes us, gives us balance, repairs us just like a fountain

00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:49.300
of every energy but that too has limited energy. Sympathetic Nervous System we use

00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:57.000
when we have any emergencies - as we run fast uh.. we develop a very high speed

00:17:57.380 --> 00:18:03.880
and the heart can start pumping very fast but when we relax,

00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:10.100
heart comes back to it's own position. That happens through the Parasympathetic Nervous System.

00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:17.240
Parasympathetic Nervous System also repairs us all the time but it has a limited energy

00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:24.900
and that's how diseases are caused because we exhaust our limited energies due to some reason.

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:31.180
May be, it may be that we have overused it so much that it is not

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:38.860
to be now fulfilled by the Parasympathetic. All these things happen and we develop diseases of different kinds.

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:47.080
As I told you yesterday we have three powers within us. One of them is the left-hand side power of desire,

00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:53.860
the second power is the right-hand side power of action and the central power of our evolution.

00:18:54.880 --> 00:19:02.180
So the left-hand side power is manifested outside in the gross as Left Sympathetic Nervous System

00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:08.600
and the right-hand side is manifested within us as the Right Sympathetic Nervous System

00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:14.980
and the central one, the Parasympathetic - so in the gross we call them by these names.

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:22.500
Now, the evolutionary process has taken place since long - it's not today that the evolution has been going on.

00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:28.240
At the matter level the evolution takes place when we have the periodic table

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:36.220
and the Carbon is placed in the center and balancing, it has four valencies, then it becomes higher and higher and higher.

00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:43.760
At the human stage when we come, we start balancing ourselves like trial and error. First we try this,

00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:47.880
"Oh, it's no good, it doesn't help us," so try another. It's like we try

00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:53.140
uh.. Capitalism, then Communism, then Capitalism, then Communism - we try all these things.

00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:59.740
It's just we go from one extreme to another extreme, then we try to come to the center

00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:07.540
and when we come to the center, that's the time our ascent takes place - it's not going to the left or to the right.

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:15.080
Now the left represents our past and the right represents our future so we have to be in the present, at this moment

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:23.760
we have to be there but we cannot be. We can, now for example people might be thinking at this time about the past,

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:29.340
may be about the future, "Whether I'll get the conveyance or not," but at this moment

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:36.000
we cannot stay but when we come to this moment, there is no thought, there is no thought.

00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:42.940
One thought rises and falls off, another thought rises and falls off. In between the thought there's a little gap

00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:51.340
and that gap is the present and that we cannot feel within ourselves because we live in the past or in the future.

00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:59.420
So when this Kundalini rises, what She does, She elongates those thoughts and by that elongation

00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:05.940
the gap between the two thoughts elongates, we can say, increases

00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:11.920
and we become thoughtlessly aware. But in the movement of the Kundalini,

00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:16.860
when  the Kundalini moves, from this state when it rises

00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:22.820
first it enters, as you see, into the first chakra of the

00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:29.260
this green chakra, which we can as the Nabhi Chakra.

00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:37.540
The Nabhi chakra is the one, which we can, the Navel center or the Solar Plexus, in the, in the gross is called as Solar Plexus

00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:44.820
which has got ten sub-plexuses, in the same way, this has got ten petals, is said there are ten petals.

00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:52.080
Now this is a very important center for us because this is the center where we start our evolution.

00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:58.820
As animals we were seeking food, we were seeking protection and that's how we evolved.

00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:03.360
Then, now at a human stage this seeking is

00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:10.400
manifested as we seek power - people want to become members of Parliament, this, that is all seeking in the power.

00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:16.280
Then some people want to have money, possessions, this, that - we seek in possessions.

00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:22.000
Some people think that, "This is my son, my child," - this my, my business goes on

00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:29.900
and they call it love and it's very possessiveness also sometimes and that's also manifests but then they discover

00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:37.640
that these things do not give you joy - there's something beyond that must be giving us joy

00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:44.600
and when that comes within our awareness then our real evolution starts.

00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:52.540
That's the point one has to reach. That's a special category of people whom we call as seekers but at this point

00:22:53.280 --> 00:23:00.700
it's a very dangerous thing. I've warned you before also, two years back, I told you that there are people in the market

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:08.740
who are just waiting to catch hold of you because they're all here to just make money, nothing else - it's all money-oriented.

00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:17.520
And when you are seeking they just grab you. They tell you, "Alright, five pounds for this and you get God."

00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:22.220
Can you imagine such nonsense they talk and people believe them!

00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:28.120
How can you get your evolution by giving money, think of it!

00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:36.640
And when I told this they were so angry with Me. I said you cannot do it, you cannot organize it, it's natural process, is your birthright

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:42.340
to get your realization and nobody can charge you money - it's a ridiculous.

00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:50.840
You are very intelligent people, you have got sciences and all that but in these matters you don't know anything, you are naive

00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:59.200
to accept these things as that you can pay for God, you can uh.. pay for your evolution, you can pay for your realization.

00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:08.900
The same thing here happens to you when you start seeking, then you think we must do something about, we must put in some effort.

00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:16.900
As I told you yesterday, with effort you go in the wrong direction - either you move to the left side or to the right side.

00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:21.360
So when you move to the left side, what happens you get possessed,

00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:27.480
you get possessed because on the left side all your Collective Consciousness is there.

00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:35.920
Cancer is caused by possessions - that is the one that triggers. I saw a television show in which

00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:42.820
they told Me, the doctors uh.. were telling people that

00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:50.820
the vulnerability of the cancer is first established because when sympathetic is too much active,

00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:57.780
vulnerable you become but triggering takes place with some proteins called protein 58

00:24:58.140 --> 00:25:06.260
and protein 52 - because they give just names - uh.. they attack you and the triggering comes from

00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:12.280
the area which is built within us since our creation - means the Collective Subconscious.

00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:20.160
So unless and until you get possessed by something cancer cannot be triggered though we are vulnerable every moment

00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:28.160
because we are so much on the sympathetic - all the time we are in emergency. So this kind of an attack comes to us from

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:33.980
this area which is built within us, known as Collective Consciousness, Subconscious.

00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:39.980
Now this Collective Subconscious is existing within us since our creation.

00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:47.780
Now, if you start moving too much into, say, bow to someone and submit to someone

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:52.520
and that guru is an expert on all these things, which we call in Sanskrit language,

00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:57.180
as Preta Vidya, Shamshan Vidya - is the, uh..is the knowledge of the dead -

00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:05.980
then they can entice you, they can mesmerise you, they can ask you to kill yourself, they can do what they like, they'll say, "Go and destroy yourself."

00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:09.520
You have heard of such cases where people have destroyed.

00:26:10.860 --> 00:26:17.260
But we must use our intelligence to understand that, "Are we to destroy ourselves now?"

00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:25.780
Then they are another kind, they will say, "You have to jump like frogs, you have to jump all the time."

00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:31.140
Anybody can jump; What is so great? But are we to become frogs or worms?

00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:41.260
Then some people going to these things, I mean, TM now, I must tell you openly, I have so many people coming from TM,  suffering from Epilepsy -

00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:48.140
absolutely they suffer from Epilepsy, no doubt about it and they have come to Me and the person who was the

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:53.120
director of their uh... academic in

00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:58.280
[ASIDE - WHAT WAS THAT PLACE?] [ROANOKE OR RONOCK?]  [ROANOKE OR RONOCK?]  in, in Scotland

00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:05.440
he came to Me and he was suffering from Epilepsy, his wife was suffering from Epilepsy, his child was suffering from Epilepsy.

00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:12.480
The fellow was such a rich man, he was a diamond merchant, he became a bankrupt, he had to go away to South Africa,

00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:19.780
the wife is now gone to India, she's so fed up of life. Now of course, she's cured with sahaja yoga and the child is alright.

00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:26.540
So they paid thousands of pounds, thousands - six thousand pounds they paid to this man,

00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:33.540
to go to Switzerland where they were given food for six days, in such way, that first day only the water

00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:41.140
that has boiled some potatoes. Then the second day that same water, third day the same water, fourth day the same water

00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:47.660
and the fifth day they were given the rind of the potato with all the filth - imagine what a mockery!

00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:53.540
And last day, the potato and six thousand pounds they paid each - is a fact.

00:27:54.240 --> 00:28:02.140
There are so many sitting here, from TM, who have been cured. Now people go just headlong, why?  Because they wanted to fly.

00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:09.660
Who has flown? Put their guru on to one of these uh.. Pisa, what you call, the leaning tower of Pisa.

00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:17.460
Let him fly, let's see, can he fly? He cannot fly but when I tell about them people don't like it because I'm telling you the truth

00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:24.320
that understand, you cannot pay for it. Now why you want to fly, I can't understand - are you going to become birds?

00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:33.480
All these queer and strange ideas, how can any intelligent man go to but the reason I ask them sometimes

00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:41.120
why, why did you? There's a Jew girl, very intelligent, she's very well educated and a barrister and all that

00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:49.280
she had big problems. I asked her, "Why, why did you go to TM? What was so great? This was all stupid they did, then why did you go?"

00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:54.140
She said, "I was so fed up with the fanaticism of the Jews that I jumped into it."

00:28:54.600 --> 00:29:02.000
Another one says, "I was so fed up with the Catholics that I went there." Another says, "The Christians were so this way, I went there."

00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:06.780
This is going 'from fire to frying pan.'

00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:13.220
How the brain works I don't understand but it is so

00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:21.280
much a common sense to understand, if somebody says that, by saying some words you are going to fly in the air

00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:29.480
for that you have to pay some money and you accept it, I must say, that somebody has really enticed you and mesmerised you

00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:34.900
otherwise nobody who is saying would accept such an absurd thing - isn't it?

00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:42.740
And I was shocked because these are the seekers, again I say, the special category of people who are seeking God.

00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:50.600
Then another group comes from India, another thugs, I tell you, real thugs, you must know

00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:58.600
that Indians are now trying to attack you in a subtle way, definitely because you attacked them in a very gross way so now they are attacking you.

00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:05.660
Same thing happening in America - you go and destroyed them, they're not dead, they're there - they are attacking back Americans.

00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:12.040
And that's how you are attacked and you accept these things because, you see, they pamper your ego,

00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:17.040
perhaps because they tell you something very intellectual, big things and you accept.

00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:22.660
Why don't you go and find out what's happening to the people? How many people have gone to the lunatic asylum?

00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:29.360
And they have money, they have so much money they can hush up anything. There were one fellow who ran away from India

00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:35.240
to America because he, Indians couldn't bear him

00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:43.060
and this fellow who ran away to America, you see, a picture was made about them, what was that, it's

00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:48.540
'God who ran away' or something like that, that picture was shown here in the BBC.

00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:57.120
BBC showed it, we have got the tape of that but this fellow has so much money that he purchased that picture from BBC

00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:04.960
and now it cannot be shown to the public; I wish we could show you that but in the private, in the drawing-rooms you can see.

00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:13.120
All these tricks are there, you see, so the money itself begets money,

00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:20.820
also begets all kinds of trickeries. You gave him money, you gave them money and they are playing money on you.

00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:25.980
One must understand that as far as God is concerned, keep money away.

00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:31.820
Anybody who asks for money is seeking money - how can he talk of God?

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:41.160
This seeking can take you to the right side also, like these lamas are -

00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:47.140
all these people are doing right side jobs, what you call the Supra-conscious jobs, the Collective Supra-conscious.

00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:51.800
Lamas, you see, you must have known that Hitler took advice from lamas.

00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:59.700
Lamas gave them advice how to capture these spirits who are very aggressive, very ruthless, very

00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:05.200
uh.. very heartless people, emotionless and that's how he managed

00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:08.540
to entice these Germans, who are still there.

00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:16.100
Even in this country or everywhere you can find this horrible, aggressive uh.. spirits are hovering on people

00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:20.920
who try to destroy others. So that work is still on,

00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:28.580
that play is still on. Actually, I must say, in the West people have, are so naive - they have no idea about the dead.

00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:37.640
What happens about the dead, they don't know and they play about. For example to have all the dead bodies in the church, is very dangerous for children.

00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:44.420
Special care must be taken when you take your children to the cemetery -

00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:52.880
it's very dangerous. I mean, Indian churches don't have anything like that. No Indian would tolerate a nonsense like that to have

00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:58.320
to walk on the graves - imagine! A lady came here to see the cathedral, they took her round,

00:32:58.540 --> 00:33:02.520
she's walking like this. I said, "Why?" She said, "You see, all dead are lying here, how to walk on top of them?"

00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:12.260
We have no idea as to how this dead acts and all these diseases are so common in this country

00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:18.560
or in the West, are because we have not paid any attention to keep out the dead.

00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:26.780
Now this knowledge was not with you that's why they took advantage of you, they came down here upon you and enticed you.

00:33:29.180 --> 00:33:36.580
And this enticement is so subtle that you can make it out. Then, in India we grow all kinds of drugs,

00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:44.120
all kinds of drugs. I've never seen any drug all My life nor do I know one person who is an Indian who takes drugs - can you imagine?

00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:51.460
But here, the drugs have crawled into - how? Because these people have introduced and the dead -

00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:55.020
those dead who want drugs, want you to drink.

00:33:55.600 --> 00:34:02.200
Even Alcoholism, if you go maximum to that side, can take you to that kind of enticement.

00:34:02.460 --> 00:34:09.380
Alcoholism can be cured by sahaja yoga because is a spirit that is drinking. It's not that you are drinking.

00:34:10.140 --> 00:34:15.460
Like, I had a lady from Cuba, a thin, little, petite lady and her husband told Me,

00:34:15.660 --> 00:34:23.080
"She can take one bottle of whisky neat." I said, "Annh, she looks such a little thing how can she take one bottle?" "Yes, she does."

00:34:23.620 --> 00:34:29.040
So I asked her, I put a, a bandhan, as we call it, on her

00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:36.140
and I saw a huge, big negro coming out of her. I asked her, "Did you know any negro?"

00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:41.140
She said, "Mother, did you see him, you see him! This is the one who drinks - everyone blames me."

00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:48.400
Really, she said so and now she is a cured woman.

00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:55.240
So, all these extremes things if you go - if you go to the extreme of the right - now people are jogging like mad. I mean,

00:34:55.460 --> 00:34:58.820
one should not do anything of extremes - little bit is alright,

00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:06.980
but going like mad, everybody running fast like, you'll get heart attacks, you must understand. You'll get heart attacks in no time.

00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:13.300
Wearing tight clothes to that extent - you will get varicose veins, you will develop all these uh..

00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:19.720
troubles of your uh.. knees and all that. You must understand you should be normal people, you should

00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:27.740
keep yourself in a way that you do everything in a moderate manner, so you keep in the central path of evolution.

00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:33.000
But going to the extreme of everything is our style.

00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:39.020
We go to extremes as Indians also go to some extremes and you go to another extremes, we can see the uh..

00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:46.140
uh..French going to another extremes - everybody is like that; They are towards the extremes but keep a moderate life

00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:52.140
and the one who leads a moderate life, is very easy for him to get his ascent.

00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:59.240
Now the same seeking becomes the seeking of God, seeking of beyond, seeking of something higher

00:35:59.540 --> 00:36:04.920
and that higher, is the Spirit; You have to become the Spirit

00:36:05.540 --> 00:36:10.320
and when you become the Spirit, what happens to you that we have to see.

00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:17.600
When you become the Spirit, physically you get alright automatically.

00:36:18.700 --> 00:36:26.680
When you start getting the vibrations, physically you are alright. Leukemia can be cured, cancer can be cured, so many things can be cured -

00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:34.580
Why? Because the exhausted energy that is in your centers gets refilled,

00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:43.360
you get connected from here to the whole, to the subtler energy which is nourishing, which is permeated into everything,

00:36:43.660 --> 00:36:48.800
which is nourishing everything - you get in contact with that; This is the yoga

00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:56.460
and all the time that energy is flowing within you. When it is flowing within you, you do not get into tensions.

00:36:57.760 --> 00:37:02.640
Not only that but this connection makes you an universal being.

00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:07.560
You become part and parcel of the whole - you are already but you are not aware.

00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:15.500
For this finger is aware that it is a part and parcel of the whole but we are not aware that we are part and parcel of the whole.

00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:24.160
So what happens that we feel, "Oh, we have helped this gentleman, we have helped that gentleman, we have done so much for that person."

00:37:24.860 --> 00:37:31.980
Actually whom do you help? You help yourself. If this finger is sick and if this finger rubs it,

00:37:32.380 --> 00:37:38.660
is it helping anyone? In the same way in sahaja yoga, we are not helping anyone, we are helping ourselves

00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:46.800
because it just flows to that area which requires help. That's how, but you become collectively conscious

00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:52.600
you start feeling where you are lacking that vitality,

00:37:52.820 --> 00:37:59.920
in what center you lack it, on your finger-tips. As I told you, that English language has a beautiful sentence called finger-tips

00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:08.460
so on your finger-tips you can feel it what is lacking in another person. Then the compassion flows - you become the compassion.

00:38:08.900 --> 00:38:15.340
You don't have to say, "Oh, I'm so compassionate," but you are the compassion but it is the compassion

00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:22.780
that starts flowing and when it starts flowing, you're in joy. You don't say, "I do it." You say, "It goes, it comes."

00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:30.360
You start talking in a third person. The word 'I' goes away. 'I believe' doesn't exist. Then we say, 'We believe,'

00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:37.160
because we are not alone, we are so many. How can we say 'I', who is the 'I'? 'I' is lost in 'We'.

00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:46.560
The energy flows to another person without any difficulty but inside yourself the peace, the joy that you feel.

00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:53.980
The attention is so enlightened that you pay attention to anyone and the person feels alright.

00:38:54.940 --> 00:39:02.800
You think of anyone you want to know, just put your hands; Like we have someone here from Scotland - he was one of the first few who got realization

00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:09.200
and very great intellectual, so he started doubting. He thought, "How can it be sitting down here I can feel something?"

00:39:09.740 --> 00:39:17.760
I said, "Alright, what do you want to know about?" He said, "My father has not telephoned for sometime, I would like to know." I said, "Alright, you put your hands like this and try to find out

00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:25.400
how is your father?" You know very gross level it is, so he put his hand and said, "Mother, I am getting a burning here, what does that mean?"

00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:31.960
Said, "It means that your father has a, a very bad uh.. throat trouble."

00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:39.000
He said, "Really?" I said, "Yes, these are all your father's centers and this center is for the throat."

00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:46.660
So he telephoned. 'Very bad bronchitis,' this is the word I used and he telephoned to his house and his mother answered

00:39:46.940 --> 00:39:51.280
and he said, "Where is father?" He said, "He is down with very bad bronchitis."

00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:56.880
He was amazed - I said, "Alright, we'll cure him now." We just rubbed this finger quite a lot

00:39:56.880 --> 00:39:57.400
 

00:39:57.400 --> 00:40:03.820
and there it was, the phone came after one hour, "Your father is alright, surprisingly, miraculously, I don't know how he got well."

00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:13.620
So physically you are alright. Mentally - I have seen many mad people become alright because how you become mad

00:40:14.220 --> 00:40:19.800
is that, there is an imbalance, you went on the left side too much, you were pulled back, you've become alright.

00:40:20.660 --> 00:40:27.480
Then emotionally you develop a balance. You see, all the time we say, "My, my, this is my sister,"

00:40:28.060 --> 00:40:33.340
till we discover that she's a snake in the grass, "She's my sister, she's my,

00:40:33.620 --> 00:40:40.120
my wife, she is my father," all those but then you see them in their real

00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:46.020
way. For example, maybe your own sister may be a snake in the grass and

00:40:46.220 --> 00:40:50.080
maybe your husband may be a gem of a person but how do you know?

00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:57.280
How do you know that this person is like that or that? On your vibrations you can see.

00:40:58.460 --> 00:41:06.320
Same thing you can ask about these gurus who have come. You ask just a question, "What do you think of this guru?" Now anyone -

00:41:06.980 --> 00:41:12.000
if he's a horrible one, you'll get burning over here. Sometimes you get blisters

00:41:13.500 --> 00:41:16.740
on your fingers and you're surprised how you got this blisters

00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:22.740
but the people who are enticed by them are absolutely gone cases.

00:41:23.020 --> 00:41:26.600
Till they are absolutely finished they don't come to sahaja yoga.

00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:32.880
It's very difficult to convince them that you get out of it, you're enticed because they think

00:41:33.260 --> 00:41:40.220
firstly, they're paid for it so they must go through it - it's a human nature. Supposing you have paid a ticket for a drama or a play

00:41:40.460 --> 00:41:44.700
and you don't like it but still you have paid for it, you sit down, "Alright, I've paid for it, better go through."

00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:51.600
Like that, they want to go through it but those who are insane, how can you talk to them?

00:41:53.220 --> 00:42:00.280
The another thing that happens to your attention is that, your attention becomes very balanced.

00:42:01.020 --> 00:42:06.580
All the time our eyes are going to this, to that, to  - our eyes become weak and

00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:14.120
we become really confused because every time we see something, we see a reaction comes in. Now I come to this place I see, "Oh, how many holes,"

00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:22.460
then I start counting the holes and people are really mad I've seen. They see advertisement, they'll say this advertisement, that adver... if they miss one they'll turn around say, "Oh, I miss that."

00:42:23.560 --> 00:42:30.180
It's like that. It's a craze with our attention which goes out all the time like mad and it reacts back

00:42:30.440 --> 00:42:36.640
and when it reacts, what happens to us that we become a confusion,

00:42:36.900 --> 00:42:43.380
a complicated personality and we do not know what to see, what not to see.

00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:50.960
Now when your attention is enlightened, you just become a pure personality - your eyes become pure.

00:42:51.860 --> 00:42:58.960
You just see purity, you can't see impure things. If you see something impure, you feel horrible, don't want to do it.

00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:07.100
Like our awareness gets that purity. For example, if you take a dog through a dirty lane,

00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:12.960
he'll just walk through, he'll have no problem but human beings will have to close their nose - they may not even go through that.

00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:21.460
But after realization you know what is sin what is not sin and you can walk through the places which are beautiful

00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:29.440
but if it is a sinful place, you don't like it, you don't enjoy - priorities change immediately. You become such a virtuous person,

00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:37.140
you are surprised at yourself what has happened to me. I have known people who have been, so called, uh..

00:43:37.380 --> 00:43:43.240
all kinds of things they call it I don't know what names but all sorts of perverted people, I can say, in general

00:43:43.540 --> 00:43:49.900
uh.. they, if they come to sahaja yoga, they become such beautiful husband, such nice wives,

00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:56.840
such straightforward people, enjoy their married life, enjoy their children and enjoy each other with purity.

00:43:57.780 --> 00:44:02.740
Now our society here in the West - for Me it is now My society because I'm sitting here -

00:44:03.380 --> 00:44:11.200
Indian society has it's problems, you have your problems but the society has become so funny that we say that

00:44:11.580 --> 00:44:19.520
uh... if you have an Indian in your house, maybe your things might disappear but if you have an Englishman or a Western man in your house, maybe your wife may disappear -

00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:27.140
is a dangerous thing and nobody minds it - it's love you see; Any nonsense is love.

00:44:27.700 --> 00:44:33.160
You spoil anybody's daughter, anything - it's love. All wrong ideas, you see.

00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:41.260
If there's purity, say, everybody is a sister or a brother or a mother - a pure relationship -

00:44:41.900 --> 00:44:48.040
the life becomes so much easier. You don't know, sahaja yogies are like that; They travel thousands.

00:44:48.300 --> 00:44:54.400
This time they went to Switzerland we had one program there, a seminar, they all lived together, no problem

00:44:54.640 --> 00:45:01.620
otherwise if so many people live there, half of the marriages would have been broken down and so many would have eloped

00:45:01.860 --> 00:45:04.800
and come back again to say that we have divorced again.

00:45:05.620 --> 00:45:12.700
This madness of divorce has come because our, our ideas have

00:45:13.240 --> 00:45:17.940
confused us - we're confused. There is no purity.

00:45:18.660 --> 00:45:23.740
If a pure person like that even looks at such a person, he becomes pure.

00:45:24.020 --> 00:45:30.140
Like Marie Magdalene when she was blessed was Christ, she became a pure woman.

00:45:30.820 --> 00:45:38.040
So the purity has to be brought in the society. If you have to save this society, you have to purify

00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:46.000
yourself. Every individual has to purify oneself. Now they say, "This is freedom," - this is license,

00:45:46.600 --> 00:45:54.580
this is not freedom. Freedom is where there is purity. Without purity there is no freedom - is abandonment,

00:45:55.140 --> 00:46:01.700
is nonsense and that's how we have felt about our life. Of course, when I'm saying that, please don't feel guilty

00:46:02.020 --> 00:46:09.260
because that is another thing can happen to you. It's just I'm saying, just telling you how you purify but don't feel guilty about anything

00:46:09.500 --> 00:46:16.900
because whatever I say, you have to forget about it. When I am giving you realization, don't remember all these points otherwise it will be difficult to give you realization.

00:46:17.120 --> 00:46:22.020
So that's past, finished, gone case - don't worry on that. Just think that how

00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:26.780
we immediately become part and parcel of a pure, beautiful society.

00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:33.040
The race that has been described, the race of God, that what William Blake has described

00:46:33.380 --> 00:46:39.420
that, "Men of God will become prophets and they'll have powers to make others prophets."

00:46:40.100 --> 00:46:45.200
For example, for a saint there is nothing like a temptation; He doesn't do wrong things - why?

00:46:46.580 --> 00:46:53.000
He just doesn't do. He doesn't have to tell himself that, "I don't run away with his things," or, "I don't run away with his wife,"

00:46:53.220 --> 00:47:00.540
or, "I don't do this wrong," or, "I don't murder anybody." He doesn't have to remember that these ten commandments are there - he's just there.

00:47:01.480 --> 00:47:09.360
He doesn't have to remember - how? Because he's gone above them. These ten commandments are in these chakras.

00:47:09.780 --> 00:47:15.860
In this chakra are these ten commandments that we have to keep a balance - don't do this, don't do that.

00:47:16.060 --> 00:47:23.380
That was alright at the time of Moses - if you say these days," Don't do," you'll have it, so best thing is to raise your Kundalini.

00:47:23.700 --> 00:47:29.920
Once you become the Spirit, you become your own master - you start guiding yourself, you know what is wrong, you don't just like it.

00:47:30.420 --> 00:47:33.700
I don't have to tell you, you just don't like it - you become a different personality.

00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:44.440
Like, I told you, a dog becomes a human being, he doesn't like a dirty lane and when a human become, a human being becomes a saint

00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:51.480
he doesn't like it, he doesn't like. But it doesn't mean that you run away to Himalaya, you run away from here - nothing.

00:47:51.980 --> 00:47:56.020
You lead absolutely a normal life but you are a detached person

00:47:56.820 --> 00:48:03.340
and that's how you enjoy the most. For example, see this carpet is beautiful - it's not Mine, I don't possess it. Thank God!

00:48:03.700 --> 00:48:10.020
I can enjoy it better than the person who possesses because he might, the one who possesses it might be thinking, "Might be dirtied

00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:15.520
don't know, Mother is sitting there, God knows what's going to happen to the carpet. I may have to take it for dry-cleaning,"

00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:19.560
or some sort of a problem will be in his mind but for Me, nothing - I'm just enjoying.

00:48:20.940 --> 00:48:28.800
So this idea of possession is a myth, we do not possess anything. It's a myth created by human-beings, you see.

00:48:29.020 --> 00:48:35.920
They have a registration office where they put it. This is, belongs to this person but can we carry it with us when we die?

00:48:38.900 --> 00:48:45.380
It's all outside and that's how we understand and then we understand something very, very beautiful about matter

00:48:46.020 --> 00:48:53.280
that the matter is for giving others, matter is to express our feelings to others.

00:48:54.540 --> 00:49:00.900
And you become generosity and generosity has it's own blessings.

00:49:03.480 --> 00:49:09.140
I enjoy My generosity very much but sometimes, you know, I feel generosity give a problem to Me

00:49:09.340 --> 00:49:15.420
because I open one door to give and ten doors are open to give Me and I don't know where to keep them, you see, it's very difficult.

00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:21.220
Now we had a big house, now My husband is saying, "You better have another big house." I said, "Why?"

00:49:21.420 --> 00:49:28.500
He said, "These things what to do? Everyday, You see,  You're having from ten doors while You're giving from one door." Now if I give from ten doors, there will be twenty doors open.

00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:37.820
Generosity fills you completely; You're not at all in need of anything. You try that - open your heart.

00:49:38.280 --> 00:49:45.400
You have to open your heart. People don't open their heart, they're so frightened, they'll open a chink and see who's there, "Oh, I see."

00:49:46.020 --> 00:49:53.980
It maybe raining, it maybe a snowy day, a lady might be standing with a perambulator and a child will be inside that

00:49:54.200 --> 00:50:00.040
but she'll be afraid to see from a chink. Who's going to invade you, who can destroy you?

00:50:00.300 --> 00:50:08.020
Who can destroy your spirit? Just enjoy your generosity. See how you will have everything.

00:50:08.820 --> 00:50:14.080
I'll give you a very small example of this in My own lifetime. I've been like this all My life

00:50:14.380 --> 00:50:19.180
and My husband had problems and My family had problems because of this.

00:50:19.440 --> 00:50:26.660
One day I was just sitting outside and knitting something when I saw a lady coming down with two other men

00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:32.100
and she said, "We are refugees from Punjab, we have no place to live in." And I had a huge house because

00:50:32.360 --> 00:50:39.080
My father was Member of the Parliament and he had a huge house of his own so, I said, "Alright, there's a room here you come along and settle down."

00:50:39.860 --> 00:50:45.200
Well I didn't ask who they were, what they were doing, I said it's an outside room let them stay there. They stayed.

00:50:46.220 --> 00:50:53.440
Then My brother came in - you see, he's now, he's now a minister, you see, a very careful man and My husband came in and My brother

00:50:53.880 --> 00:50:58.880
screwed into his brain that, "This is wrong, we don't know these may be thieves, these may be this and

00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:03.280
My sister always does like that, I don't know what's going to happen to us and all."

00:51:03.880 --> 00:51:08.420
I said, "Whatever they are, they are My responsibility, now you're not going to drive them out at any cost."

00:51:08.940 --> 00:51:15.240
At that time a war started and people came to kill and one of them was a Muslim so he, the people came

00:51:15.520 --> 00:51:21.740
in our house and they said, "We have heard there's a Muslim staying in your house." I said, "See this, I am a Christian but I put on this."

00:51:21.960 --> 00:51:29.760
I said, "See this is a mark, now, do you believe Me or not." I said, "You better get out from here," and they went away and this the fellow was saved, you see.

00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:34.620
Now, he was a very great poet. I went to Bombay long, long

00:51:35.080 --> 00:51:39.060
uh.. years later, I should say, about twelve or fourteen years later

00:51:40.040 --> 00:51:47.560
and we were making a little film about something and I was dealing with it so I said, "I know this lady

00:51:48.040 --> 00:51:54.580
uh.. but I won't come there to ask her because she was a great film actress." I said, "I will not ask her because she'll have no choice."

00:51:55.140 --> 00:51:59.100
They said, "But You must say something about." I said, "No, nothing doing, I'm not coming, you go and ask her."

00:51:59.480 --> 00:52:03.940
So they went and asked her. She said, "No, no, no, no I cannot join, I must have so much money

00:52:04.220 --> 00:52:09.000
and you cannot have me for nothing at all and this I don't believe in all these charities, this, that,"

00:52:10.520 --> 00:52:18.580
so I kept quiet, didn't say anything but for the opening of the film I went and she was there, she looked at Me and tears started rolling her eyes, just came and embraced Me.

00:52:19.580 --> 00:52:27.180
She said, "I didn't know You were with this." I said, "I know you didn't know, " but she said, "Forgive me, I'll give money, I'll give everything.

00:52:27.420 --> 00:52:32.840
This is the lady who saved me long time back," and everybody was amazed

00:52:33.320 --> 00:52:38.960
how this lady who was so materialistic and so particular about her payment has suddenly melted away.

00:52:39.220 --> 00:52:47.140
She said, "Oh God, now I learnt, I'd forgotten, I'fd forgotten what it means to be generous," and she was completely changed after that.

00:52:47.840 --> 00:52:55.080
So all these things are the quality of the Spirit which is not afraid of anyone - why should you be afraid of anyone

00:52:55.520 --> 00:53:03.100
if you are one with God? Look at Christ, he had nothing to do with the prostitute but when people started hitting her with the stone

00:53:03.420 --> 00:53:10.220
He came up and He said, "Now among you, who has not committed any sin, can throw a stone at Me."

00:53:10.920 --> 00:53:17.340
Imagine the courage! The courage comes from the Spirit. Because He was Spirit, so He could say such a thing.

00:53:17.680 --> 00:53:24.960
He was not a man compromising with His values, "Alright, if you want we can have discotheque in the church,"

00:53:29.360 --> 00:53:35.600
or we can start a pub; Nowadays they are selling it for pubs. "Let us compromise."

00:53:36.700 --> 00:53:44.400
Truth cannot compromise - it does not. Compassion is different from compromising.

00:53:45.420 --> 00:53:52.840
It cannot compromise - truth stands on it's own legs. So that's what happened when Christ said that

00:53:53.360 --> 00:53:59.340
and that happens to you, you become a strong person. You become a person who's strong

00:53:59.600 --> 00:54:07.160
but does not try to oppress other. You do not try to destroy others, you do not want to hate anyone

00:54:07.540 --> 00:54:15.380
but what you do is, to stand up on your own, to stand up for the rights of other, to stand up for something great.

00:54:15.760 --> 00:54:23.360
Like we will say Abraham Lincoln, a person like him - Abraham Lincoln was a realized soul - and how he fought for the rights,

00:54:23.620 --> 00:54:28.660
how he talked about democracy. Today let's compromise this, let's compromise that.

00:54:29.020 --> 00:54:34.460
Even if somebody is a Hitler - doesn't matter, as long as he is with us, alright, accept him.

00:54:36.940 --> 00:54:44.640
To have that strength you have to be the Spirit - so you become a very, strong, compassionate person.

00:54:44.920 --> 00:54:50.580
Only a person who is strong can be compassionate. How can a weakling be a compassionate person - tell Me?

00:54:51.320 --> 00:54:57.440
A tree, which is strong, can only give shelter to people or do you think a falling tree can

00:54:57.680 --> 00:55:00.640
shelter the people - on the contrary it will fall on the people.

00:55:02.340 --> 00:55:06.780
Our ideas are very, very confused about compassion

00:55:07.140 --> 00:55:12.080
and when you become such a strong person, you see the truth before you,

00:55:12.720 --> 00:55:19.660
you know the truth and you are no more afraid of anyone and God looks after you, the best part of it.

00:55:20.040 --> 00:55:25.580
You just don't worry - God looks after you in every inch of the world.

00:55:26.100 --> 00:55:33.260
Every inch of the world - in material way, in your emotional way,

00:55:34.380 --> 00:55:41.700
in your physical way - every way you feel surrounded by His love and His guidance

00:55:42.120 --> 00:55:47.800
and His help. He does in such a way - I'll give you a very recent example of sahaja yogies.

00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:54.720
They wanted to go to a place, a very beautiful uh...

00:55:56.540 --> 00:56:02.140
hill, mountain peak, which is known as Zelmet, in uh...

00:56:02.980 --> 00:56:06.560
Switzerland and it's a very expensive place to go to

00:56:06.900 --> 00:56:13.880
because I told them something about that - it looks like a one of the deities and all that - they were wanting to go and have a seminar there.

00:56:14.460 --> 00:56:17.900
It's a very expensive place and we cannot pay for that,

00:56:18.160 --> 00:56:22.860
they thought that it will be very difficult because uh.. they are not so well off.

00:56:24.820 --> 00:56:32.260
So I said, "Alright, you go and find out." So the people went down to find out and there is a huge, big hotel like place

00:56:32.920 --> 00:56:37.060
and, "Oh," they said, "When do you want to come?"  So they said such and such date.

00:56:37.640 --> 00:56:44.480
"Oh, for that date!" they just ran, "Oh, very good, very good. If you want to come for those dates - we somehow or the other cannot fill those dates

00:56:45.160 --> 00:56:50.260
so we are very happy." And they were charging 70

00:56:51.680 --> 00:56:58.740
francs per night and for three days now they're charging us  - how much - 33 francs, for three days -

00:56:59.140 --> 00:57:04.940
means about eleven pounds or twelve pounds - can you imagine?

00:57:05.500 --> 00:57:11.900
And now all of them can go and see. This is just a miracle and so many miracles take place like that.

00:57:12.260 --> 00:57:19.800
Even the poster they have put here - you have seen a big poster uh.. in Brighton - now we can't afford because we don't take any money, we

00:57:20.020 --> 00:57:24.680
whatever little money they have, they collect and put things. They were finding it impossible

00:57:24.900 --> 00:57:30.880
to advertise. We cannot compete with these false people on two things. Firstly, we cannot advertise

00:57:31.080 --> 00:57:35.080
the way they can because they have money and secondly, we cannot go on telling lies the way they do.

00:57:35.800 --> 00:57:43.080
They can tell any lies, they'll say that, "We, we will create a new world for you and there will be all gold for you, " and all those because they're liars.

00:57:44.160 --> 00:57:49.820
We are our limitations, we cannot tell you lies. So these uh.. advertising thing also

00:57:50.160 --> 00:57:55.940
was impossible for us to do it but they did it for a song, just for a song.
