1
00:00:24,148 --> 00:00:28,194
Today I just thought that there are

2
00:00:28,523 --> 00:00:31,069
quite a lot of people who have come for the first time.

3
00:00:31,711 --> 00:00:33,741
And I should tell them about

4
00:00:34,555 --> 00:00:38,101
the significance of Puja.

5
00:00:38,531 --> 00:00:43,958
Because, as the western style of life is,

6
00:00:44,864 --> 00:00:49,289
that they're meant to be like this.

7
00:00:49,801 --> 00:00:54,658
To seek something outside, to go outside,

8
00:00:54,858 --> 00:00:58,720
find out new ways and methods to grow outside.

9
00:00:59,552 --> 00:01:03,454
Now this is the knowledge of your roots.

10
00:01:03,685 --> 00:01:08,003
Knowledge, through which you receive your nourishment,

11
00:01:08,372 --> 00:01:12,855
this knowledge is not known to you before

12
00:01:13,286 --> 00:01:15,887
and was not deliberately told

13
00:01:16,088 --> 00:01:19,297
because you are supposed to grow outside.

14
00:01:19,542 --> 00:01:24,466
Now when you have to go inside, then you have to understand

15
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:29,417
the divine laws and divine methods, how it works out.

16
00:01:30,427 --> 00:01:33,380
The Puja has a significance,

17
00:01:33,669 --> 00:01:37,627
from ancient times the saints described them.

18
00:01:37,827 --> 00:01:40,760
Because in India, the whole climate is such

19
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:44,249
that you can live under a tree,

20
00:01:44,774 --> 00:01:47,594
live in a forest no problem,

21
00:01:47,795 --> 00:01:51,357
you can eat fruits and very happily you could be in a forest.

22
00:01:51,591 --> 00:01:55,408
There is no need to have bed or anything, it is so warm and nice,

23
00:01:55,623 --> 00:01:59,658
and then always enjoy the bliss of a forest.

24
00:02:00,674 --> 00:02:04,066
And thus many people went into the forest

25
00:02:04,299 --> 00:02:08,478
and started thinking, looking at the whole world from that

26
00:02:10,017 --> 00:02:11,751
solitude,

27
00:02:12,149 --> 00:02:13,637
what is the problem with human being?

28
00:02:13,845 --> 00:02:15,235
Why are we here?

29
00:02:15,454 --> 00:02:17,151
What should we do?

30
00:02:17,352 --> 00:02:20,029
What is the purpose of this human life?

31
00:02:20,372 --> 00:02:22,899
Why God has given us this beautiful human life?

32
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:25,223
They started thinking about it.

33
00:02:25,466 --> 00:02:28,335
And that is how they went into meditative position,

34
00:02:28,536 --> 00:02:32,318
meditative entry within themselves.

35
00:02:32,551 --> 00:02:36,279
And when they started meditating, they found all about Kundalini,

36
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,543
about chakras and the deities that reside on them.

37
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:45,144
Now, these deities have resided from eternal times.

38
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:50,165
We can say in the abode of God they have all resided there

39
00:02:50,386 --> 00:02:54,894
and then they were reflected on this Earth

40
00:02:55,389 --> 00:03:00,120
and they incarnated just to give us

41
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:03,139
a better and better awareness.

42
00:03:03,537 --> 00:03:06,001
We could have avoided all this.

43
00:03:06,285 --> 00:03:09,079
It could have been very easy

44
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:13,943
if we had listened to God at the time of Adam and Eve.

45
00:03:14,294 --> 00:03:17,047
At the time of Adam and Eve,

46
00:03:17,407 --> 00:03:22,152
it was told that you should not eat the fruit of knowledge.

47
00:03:22,407 --> 00:03:25,352
Now, that was not the fruit of the true knowledge,

48
00:03:25,586 --> 00:03:29,198
but the fruit of knowledge was the knowledge about the matter,

49
00:03:29,399 --> 00:03:31,617
the knowledge about things.

50
00:03:31,843 --> 00:03:36,966
So, as you know, the story is, satanic forces worked,

51
00:03:37,218 --> 00:03:40,771
they lured both of them and they started

52
00:03:41,427 --> 00:03:44,958
developing themselves on the other side.

53
00:03:45,443 --> 00:03:47,177
That is how they made a mistake.

54
00:03:47,497 --> 00:03:50,200
That is why it is called as original sin.

55
00:03:50,485 --> 00:03:53,989
And that original sin has brought us to this brink now,

56
00:03:54,261 --> 00:03:55,902
and we have to go back.

57
00:03:56,102 --> 00:03:59,273
We have to go back within ourselves to find our roots.

58
00:03:59,473 --> 00:04:01,490
And that is why to improve

59
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:04,782
on their mistakes and to improve on their ignorance

60
00:04:04,982 --> 00:04:08,559
that is how the first ignorance was set in.

61
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:13,261
The darkness of ignorance was set in because of that mistake.

62
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:16,934
And then from darkness we had to come to human stage.

63
00:04:17,233 --> 00:04:19,680
And when we have to come to human stage, we have to pass

64
00:04:19,881 --> 00:04:25,037
through all those different various stages of life where

65
00:04:26,974 --> 00:04:29,349
incarnations had to take place.

66
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:31,702
So, now, as as you know very well,

67
00:04:32,145 --> 00:04:36,279
that we have incarnations placed within our centres

68
00:04:36,585 --> 00:04:39,452
which are not yet awakened.

69
00:04:40,014 --> 00:04:43,159
That means they are not in our attention.

70
00:04:43,359 --> 00:04:46,901
They are not to be felt in our central nervous system.

71
00:04:47,135 --> 00:04:51,191
Or we cannot feel them on our finger tips, to be very very simple.

72
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:55,893
So they are there, but they are not acting according to our desire.

73
00:04:56,093 --> 00:04:59,315
We do not know them and they do not listen to us.

74
00:04:59,515 --> 00:05:03,518
They do what is right for them or what they think is proper.

75
00:05:03,718 --> 00:05:06,882
You have no connection with them so far.

76
00:05:07,281 --> 00:05:11,281
So, the first thing is to connect yourself

77
00:05:11,482 --> 00:05:14,798
with those different stages through which you have passed.

78
00:05:14,999 --> 00:05:17,398
So, the first as you know is the Ganesha's stage,

79
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:20,313
it is innocence. Innocence, the

80
00:05:20,514 --> 00:05:24,440
formless of innocence was made into Shri Ganesha,

81
00:05:24,932 --> 00:05:30,432
because some nucleus has to emit that innocence.

82
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:34,517
Now, in the whole world

83
00:05:34,955 --> 00:05:38,849
there are eight such creations of the Mother Earth,

84
00:05:39,061 --> 00:05:42,695
and luckily they are in Maharastra.

85
00:05:43,031 --> 00:05:46,030
You will find Maharastrian people on the whole are innocent,

86
00:05:46,241 --> 00:05:49,486
compared to others, they are rather innocent by nature.

87
00:05:49,711 --> 00:05:54,159
And the reason is from the Mother Earth only the innocence is emitted.

88
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,622
So the first thing is that within us to establish innocence

89
00:05:57,822 --> 00:05:59,848
we have to worship Shri Ganesha.

90
00:06:00,049 --> 00:06:02,250
So, when you worship Me as Shri Ganesha,

91
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:05,244
the Shri Ganesha within you is awakened.

92
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:07,924
You see the result of that.

93
00:06:08,179 --> 00:06:09,821
So, the people who are suffering,

94
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:14,859
say, from the trouble of all these perversions,

95
00:06:15,059 --> 00:06:17,665
these modern diseases that have come,

96
00:06:17,907 --> 00:06:19,766
must establish their Shri Ganesha.

97
00:06:19,966 --> 00:06:23,592
If they cannot establish their Shri Ganesha, they cannot be cured.

98
00:06:23,865 --> 00:06:26,627
So their innocence has to be first established.

99
00:06:26,989 --> 00:06:29,249
If he cannot establish their innocence,

100
00:06:29,449 --> 00:06:31,208
we cannot cure them.

101
00:06:31,408 --> 00:06:34,823
First and foremost thing is to establish Shri Ganesha.

102
00:06:35,066 --> 00:06:38,751
And Shri Ganesha is made out of the Mother Earth element.

103
00:06:38,951 --> 00:06:42,589
So, by praying to Shri Ganesha we also establish Him,

104
00:06:42,789 --> 00:06:46,708
in a city, in a place like this place now

105
00:06:46,908 --> 00:06:51,008
is San Francisco, where I came here first we had no Puja, nothing.

106
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:54,015
That is why the whole thing was just touch and go.

107
00:06:54,254 --> 00:06:55,784
I couldn't go deep into people.

108
00:06:55,985 --> 00:06:58,277
I couldn't go deep into the place and so the,

109
00:06:58,477 --> 00:07:00,549
I didn't know how I would be able to manage,

110
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:04,960
because there is no education on this.

111
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,288
People are not educated about it.

112
00:07:07,489 --> 00:07:09,884
But in India immediately the first thing is Puja.

113
00:07:10,084 --> 00:07:11,276
They will not come to my lecture,

114
00:07:11,476 --> 00:07:13,135
they will not come to anything, first is Puja.

115
00:07:13,335 --> 00:07:16,154
If there is a Puja, everybody is getting up at 4 o'clock,

116
00:07:16,421 --> 00:07:18,908
having a bath, getting ready to come to Puja.

117
00:07:19,108 --> 00:07:21,121
Because they know the importance of it,

118
00:07:21,321 --> 00:07:26,672
that just your essence is awakened by it.

119
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:30,516
Essence is awakened and to awaken the essence

120
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:33,860
you have to be

121
00:07:34,115 --> 00:07:36,295
there, at a place where this is done,

122
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,516
so that your essence is awakened.

123
00:07:39,717 --> 00:07:42,641
Now, the trouble is with ego-oriented societies,

124
00:07:42,842 --> 00:07:44,638
is very difficult to tell them about Puja.

125
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:47,156
It’s find it difficult, that is why we do not allow

126
00:07:47,357 --> 00:07:49,377
everyone to come to Puja for one reason,

127
00:07:49,577 --> 00:07:52,149
because as soon as they see something happening,

128
00:07:52,174 --> 00:07:53,846
their ego starts up, you see.

129
00:07:53,871 --> 00:07:56,017
And instead of doing anything to them,

130
00:07:56,217 --> 00:08:01,377
the barrier is so much, that I can't just do anything about it.

131
00:08:01,402 --> 00:08:04,603
The barrier is too much in their ego, they have their own ideas,

132
00:08:04,803 --> 00:08:07,064
their own conceptions, their own feeling,

133
00:08:07,264 --> 00:08:12,506
and it's impossible to penetrate deep into them, so it is a waste.

134
00:08:12,758 --> 00:08:14,884
And if you cannot receive the vibrations,

135
00:08:15,084 --> 00:08:17,863
I feel the pain in my own centres.

136
00:08:18,082 --> 00:08:20,387
Because the deities, you see, get so annoyed,

137
00:08:20,611 --> 00:08:22,499
and they don't like it and they think that

138
00:08:22,699 --> 00:08:25,331
why Mother should waste Her energy with these people

139
00:08:25,531 --> 00:08:26,986
who do not understand about Puja.

140
00:08:27,187 --> 00:08:30,851
So, I want to prepare you beforehand, that you keep yourself open.

141
00:08:31,085 --> 00:08:32,929
Don't allow your ego to come up.

142
00:08:32,954 --> 00:08:35,662
It's nothing for Me to gain. It is for you to gain.

143
00:08:35,862 --> 00:08:37,413
Keep your minds open.

144
00:08:37,613 --> 00:08:40,027
The trouble is that at the time of this Sahasrara opening,

145
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:43,179
this brain, everybody's brain is upside down.

146
00:08:43,379 --> 00:08:46,396
It is impossible, you try to turn it and they jump on you.

147
00:08:46,596 --> 00:08:48,890
It is a big problem for me, it is the biggest problem.

148
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:50,851
Because, all other incarnations came,

149
00:08:51,051 --> 00:08:54,648
they didn't have to do this difficult work of making you something.

150
00:08:54,848 --> 00:08:58,451
Just it was to awaken within you a awareness,

151
00:08:58,652 --> 00:09:01,299
like Christ had to awaken your Agyna Charka.

152
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:05,044
Alright, he has crucified himself for the same reason,

153
00:09:05,245 --> 00:09:07,635
He resurrected Himself for the same reason.

154
00:09:07,835 --> 00:09:09,884
It was a very hard life for him

155
00:09:10,084 --> 00:09:13,184
and, for the Mother, it was even worse, no doubt.

156
00:09:13,384 --> 00:09:18,837
But still, one should know that this is a very hazardous thing,

157
00:09:19,079 --> 00:09:22,544
to transform people and then to establish them

158
00:09:22,744 --> 00:09:28,696
and create out of these little seeds a huge big tree of a saint.

159
00:09:29,349 --> 00:09:32,932
Now, in the same way, we have got Moses, we have got Abraham,

160
00:09:33,132 --> 00:09:36,514
all these great saints are within our, in our void.

161
00:09:36,715 --> 00:09:39,365
They are the gurus. And on a Guru Puja,

162
00:09:39,566 --> 00:09:41,589
when you worship me on the Guru Puja day,

163
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:45,106
that time these are awakened within you, and you become a master,

164
00:09:45,306 --> 00:09:46,550
you become yourself a Guru.

165
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:49,499
You yourself know so much,

166
00:09:49,699 --> 00:09:51,976
even I don't have to tell you, I don't think

167
00:09:52,176 --> 00:09:56,537
I have talked to people very much in private, or explain to things.

168
00:09:56,737 --> 00:09:59,357
But somehow they become so much full of knowledge,

169
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:02,132
that is rather surprising how they understand. Like,

170
00:10:02,332 --> 00:10:03,798
I was talking to Yogi Mahajan

171
00:10:03,998 --> 00:10:07,227
and he was telling me what's the problem is with human being and,

172
00:10:07,428 --> 00:10:10,866
you see, he was telling me how we cannot relate to them and all.

173
00:10:10,933 --> 00:10:13,787
Which is interesting, because My father did same to Me.

174
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:18,051
I said that he is my first guru and all of you my second gurus.

175
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:21,018
Because I don't understand human beings.

176
00:10:21,219 --> 00:10:23,224
You see for example, this homosexual business.

177
00:10:23,424 --> 00:10:25,944
When Gregoire, with very great reluctance, you see,

178
00:10:26,144 --> 00:10:27,401
told me through somebody else,

179
00:10:27,702 --> 00:10:30,452
I  nearly fainted, actually could not understand,

180
00:10:30,477 --> 00:10:32,901
what's happened to them? Now, what am I to do?

181
00:10:33,101 --> 00:10:35,654
And I couldn't eat my food for one week.

182
00:10:35,854 --> 00:10:37,851
I felt so bad about the whole thing.

183
00:10:37,876 --> 00:10:40,613
Like, My own children where are they?.

184
00:10:40,638 --> 00:10:44,722
If you have a heart of an intense Mother,

185
00:10:44,957 --> 00:10:46,795
you can understand what she feels about it.

186
00:10:46,996 --> 00:10:48,363
And I knew they are in for trouble,

187
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:52,587
I knew everything was going to be very very hazardous.

188
00:10:52,831 --> 00:10:54,778
But doesn't matter, by God's grace

189
00:10:54,979 --> 00:10:57,063
everything will be all right. I am sure it will work out.

190
00:10:57,264 --> 00:10:59,549
So, first we have to establish Shri Ganesha.

191
00:10:59,757 --> 00:11:02,244
First of all, we have to establish Shri Ganesha within ourselves

192
00:11:02,445 --> 00:11:06,240
and Shri Ganesha in this place called San Francisco.

193
00:11:06,483 --> 00:11:09,732
Alright? That is why we have to first do Shri Ganesha's Puja.

194
00:11:09,974 --> 00:11:11,468
Then, secondly I told him

195
00:11:11,669 --> 00:11:15,015
that if possible we should do little bit of Shri Vishnu's,

196
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:19,072
because he is the one who gives us the evolutionary power

197
00:11:19,273 --> 00:11:23,180
by which we can evolve ourselves and evolve others.

198
00:11:23,381 --> 00:11:26,708
So we have a little time for Shri Vishnu's Puja.

199
00:11:26,908 --> 00:11:29,521
Also, they do Havanas all that for Shri Vishnu's Puja,

200
00:11:29,846 --> 00:11:32,800
which is very good to clear the atmosphere sort of thing.

201
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,736
But we will do next year all these things, perhaps, maybe,

202
00:11:35,937 --> 00:11:38,402
because now we don't have these arrangements.

203
00:11:38,602 --> 00:11:40,608
But that would be a very good idea, too.

204
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:46,499
And then thirdly they want to do the the Puja of Shakti, the Mother.

205
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,272
Because, unless and until you have power,

206
00:11:49,472 --> 00:11:51,700
even if all the deities are there, you will be exhausted,

207
00:11:51,901 --> 00:11:53,075
you wouldn't be able to work it out.

208
00:11:53,276 --> 00:11:57,223
So the third is of your own power, of your Kundalini,

209
00:11:57,424 --> 00:12:02,307
of the power that is going to work out this Divine work.

210
00:12:02,533 --> 00:12:03,902
That is how we have three Pujas.

211
00:12:04,102 --> 00:12:06,863
But none of you should get into an ego trip.

212
00:12:07,064 --> 00:12:09,440
Please, keep your ego on one side.

213
00:12:09,641 --> 00:12:13,142
Just now, see for yourself how it works within yourself.

214
00:12:13,342 --> 00:12:16,877
You start feeling good, you start feeling better vibrations

215
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:21,048
and you start feeling much better and healthier within yourself.

216
00:12:21,248 --> 00:12:24,091
So, just keep your self open. It is you

217
00:12:24,294 --> 00:12:26,183
who has to achieve something, not Me.

218
00:12:26,383 --> 00:12:30,267
I don't have to achieve anything. So you better make use of Me.

219
00:12:30,476 --> 00:12:34,137
Because I am here only for today and then I will go away.

220
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:36,017
So, make best use of Me

221
00:12:36,042 --> 00:12:39,206
and that is why I said as many as possible try to call

222
00:12:39,407 --> 00:12:41,667
the people over here will be a good idea.

223
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,517
May God Bless you.
