00:10.513 --> 00:14.280
This is the wisdom which is to be imbibed.

00:14.536 --> 00:17.674
You cannot practice it, you cannot force it,

00:17.687 --> 00:21.320
but it's to be imbibed through your spirituality.

00:21.440 --> 00:25.120
Then the greatest thing that happens is the joy,

00:25.119 --> 00:30.279
joy of the dancing of Shri Ganesh.

00:30.594 --> 00:32.974
Like a child you see Him dancing;

00:33.039 --> 00:37.141
how joyous He feels, and you also feel.

00:37.637 --> 00:43.318
In the same way, a little child being born within you,

00:43.529 --> 00:47.159
and you start behaving like a small child.

00:50.280 --> 00:55.560
If you see a little child, who is properly brought up of course,

00:55.615 --> 00:58.760
he will always bother about other people.

00:58.951 --> 01:05.911
He'll find out what others need, what are, what can make them happy.

01:06.146 --> 01:12.640
He'll listen all the simple methods, he will try to please others,

01:12.179 --> 01:17.560
but not to gain any favor or to show off that he's very generous,

01:17.654 --> 01:22.130
but in the real sense of the word, that gives him joy.

01:22.365 --> 01:24.568
That is the collectivity.

01:24.716 --> 01:27.161
Today I am going to tell you something more about

01:27.332 --> 01:29.653
this collective nature that comes to you

01:29.763 --> 01:36.786
through Shri Ganesha's efforts, or we can say His powers.

01:38.184 --> 01:42.526
Somebody told Me that Einstein has already made a story like that,

01:42.808 --> 01:47.452
is a discovery that if you all become cool,

01:47.648 --> 01:51.046
that is under the Shri Ganesha's blessing,

01:51.523 --> 01:55.733
then we all become one.

01:56.983 --> 02:02.400
That's his theory. But we also had Phil Ward here

02:02.680 --> 02:07.983
who established that when you cool down the helium gas,

02:07.693 --> 02:16.617
all the molecules or you can call them atoms,

02:16.814 --> 02:20.552
they start moving in a collective way.

02:20.763 --> 02:23.880
Otherwise they are hitting each other,

02:23.871 --> 02:27.414
they are beating each other and they are running helter and skelter.

02:27.664 --> 02:32.133
In the same way, when we have Shri Ganesha's blessing within us

02:32.360 --> 02:35.629
in the real sense of the word, with our wisdom,

02:35.708 --> 02:42.520
then what happens, we become very much evolved Sahaja yogis.

02:43.320 --> 02:47.720
Evolved Sahaja yogis are, means they have become one.

02:48.248 --> 02:53.744
‘One’ means what? ‘One’ means they all live for each other,

02:53.704 --> 03:00.368
they enjoy each other, they see the comfort of each other

03:00.743 --> 03:07.200
For example, the people who are very rich, people who are very poor,

03:07.577 --> 03:10.499
people who are sick, people who are healthy,

03:10.655 --> 03:14.529
all of them combined together as one

03:14.723 --> 03:18.200
in Sanskrit it is called ‘eka karita’

03:18.348 --> 03:24.175
they become one. And this oneness shows in your celebrations,

03:24.318 --> 03:28.604
when you all come here you try to help each other all the time, I have seen.

03:28.737 --> 03:31.580
Nobody minds helping each other.

03:31.729 --> 03:34.655
I have seen people enjoying each other.

03:34.779 --> 03:37.521
They do not want to hurt anyone;

03:37.663 --> 03:42.396
on the contrary, they want to be helpful and sensible with each other.

03:42.529 --> 03:47.895
Most of your leaders I have chosen who are very wise,

03:48.145 --> 03:53.442
who avoid problems, who do not get into panics,

03:53.640 --> 03:55.606
most of them, I should say.

03:55.739 --> 04:01.497
And when you see, even you people try to destroy Sahaja Yoga,

04:01.661 --> 04:04.127
they know you are doing it.

04:04.432 --> 04:09.783
So to find out this eka karita, you have to go deep down into yourself

04:09.963 --> 04:13.346
by which you will feel that you are all one.

04:13.471 --> 04:19.453
Whether you are here or you are in Japan or in America, anywhere,

04:19.585 --> 04:24.272
you all think the same way, you all help the same cause,

04:24.367 --> 04:27.815
and you try to be the same style.

04:27.956 --> 04:33.136
I have seen people when they come for the pujas, so many of them,

04:33.320 --> 04:39.057
how they enjoy each other's company, how they try to help each other.

04:39.260 --> 04:47.626
Somebody who is, say, in Russia or say, in Bulgaria, anywhere,

04:47.790 --> 04:54.821
he will write to Me about the problem he has, something.

04:54.203 --> 04:59.627
So somebody from America, without I tell him, without I inform him,

04:59.771 --> 05:03.480
without any information immediately writes to Me,

05:03.497 --> 05:06.061
‘Mother, such and such a person is there in Russia.

05:06.210 --> 05:09.702
Will You be able to send that person to America?’

05:09.840 --> 05:14.044
Most of the time it happens like this.

05:14.153 --> 05:18.216
But I don't tell them. I never ask them.

05:18.341 --> 05:24.187
Even if I ask, suddenly there will be a response from so many people

05:24.336 --> 05:31.049
from so many countries, ‘Mother, this is the problem? All right, we'll go and do it.’

05:31.181 --> 05:35.868
For that I must say Austrians are very sensible people in this respect,

05:35.981 --> 05:42.634
this eka karita. They went all the way to Jerusalem,

05:43.135 --> 05:48.804
you know, to help the people, to get them realized.

05:49.008 --> 05:54.078
I wanted to go to Jerusalem, but this bombing business may not allow Me to go.

05:54.240 --> 05:56.739
But the Jerusalem people, I found them,

05:57.012 --> 06:00.067
found them to be much more collective,

06:00.145 --> 06:05.244
because they came to Egypt. I said, ‘Why have you come here?’

06:05.432 --> 06:10.280
‘Made friends with the Muslims of Egypt.’

06:10.720 --> 06:15.185
Just imagine! I was surprised. How could they come here?

06:15.341 --> 06:16.740
No, just to make friends.

06:16.810 --> 06:20.181
‘They are Muslims, so we want to make friends with them.’

06:20.416 --> 06:25.994
So making friendship without any ulterior motive, without any gain,

06:26.205 --> 06:29.606
is one of the signs of your eka karita.

06:29.816 --> 06:33.206
Not only that you are satisfied with other Sahaja yogis,

06:33.301 --> 06:36.760
but you want to bring other Sahaja yogis in.

06:37.118 --> 06:45.080
So many have done that. This is something so nourishing.

06:46.271 --> 06:51.960
Now, as you are being enlightened,

06:52.168 --> 06:56.096
you get another person who is enlightened.

06:56.337 --> 06:58.860
It's very great joy-giving.

06:59.009 --> 07:03.264
If you give realization to one person, you feel very happy.

07:03.420 --> 07:07.451
I mean, so many write to Me, ‘Mother, now we have got thirty persons,

07:07.680 --> 07:11.115
twenty persons,’ and they're very happy about it,

07:11.263 --> 07:13.437
that we have got so many Sahaja yogis.

07:13.678 --> 07:16.577
But doing that, one should not develop the ego

07:16.663 --> 07:18.858
then again you go against Ganesha,

07:18.952 --> 07:22.876
because Christ, you know, He doesn't like it.

07:23.001 --> 07:27.391
Egoistical people He doesn't like, and He's Shri Ganesh.

07:28.120 --> 07:33.488
So He doesn't like such people who out of their ego want to create

07:33.612 --> 07:38.181
an organization of their own, and try to dominate others.

07:38.229 --> 07:41.525
This kind of people they don't like.

07:41.682 --> 07:46.646
Both of them are the same, there is complete eka karita between them.

07:46.739 --> 07:51.981
In the same way we too develop that special quality of eka karita.

07:52.146 --> 07:55.740
We forget about so-called religions that we have.

07:55.794 --> 07:57.286
See now how they are fighting.

07:57.349 --> 08:00.663
All the religions which are outside are fighting among themselves.

08:00.787 --> 08:05.115
They are dishonest, they are doing all kinds of wrong things - you know it very well.

08:05.233 --> 08:10.223
It's every day it's in the newspaper that you hear about what wrong they are doing.

08:10.403 --> 08:13.629
They are little bit successful, but not for a long time,

08:13.777 --> 08:17.733
because they will be exposed. This is the time of exposure,

08:17.835 --> 08:24.320
that they will lose that great fai
th on which they have been working out.

08:24.504 --> 08:28.848
All these will have to just disappear,

08:29.004 --> 08:34.080
these false ideas about superiority of any religion.

08:34.249 --> 08:37.632
How can a religion be superior to another one,

08:37.740 --> 08:42.943
which is created by the effort of Shri Ganesha's auspiciousness?

08:43.325 --> 08:47.146
It's not auspicious at all that you fight another religion

08:47.286 --> 08:55.729
or you fight another creed, or you say that this is a lesser race,

08:55.894 --> 08:58.095
or we are a higher race.

08:58.118 --> 09:01.259
All these false ideas, they drop out.

09:01.798 --> 09:06.882
This doesn't remain anymore, because all these ideas have created problems.

09:07.077 --> 09:10.202
Say in America, they first hated the blacks,

09:10.374 --> 09:13.232
so now the blacks are hating the whites.

09:13.388 --> 09:16.383
It's a big turmoil going on, you see.

09:16.749 --> 09:23.739
Then we have, also in India we had people who were supposed to be

09:24.802 --> 09:29.720
untouchables. They were tortured, they were troubled,

09:29.727 --> 09:33.413
and they did a lot of wrong things which they should have never done,

09:33.444 --> 09:36.087
which is not written in the shastras.

09:36.068 --> 09:41.589
Because of that now they are acting against the so-called ‘touchables’

09:41.715 --> 09:44.285
and putting them right in their own places.

09:44.386 --> 09:47.801
So this brings in conflict.

09:48.395 --> 09:52.137
Shri Ganesha is the one, when He gives you wisdom you understand

09:52.318 --> 09:55.972
that nobody is superior to another person.

09:56.105 --> 09:58.621
You are all made by God,

09:58.777 --> 10:02.873
and is whatever is made by God is auspicious and beautiful.

10:03.037 --> 10:08.990
Once you start understanding that, this eka karita spreads outside also.

10:09.256 --> 10:11.407
It spreads to other people.

10:11.530 --> 10:19.153
It's not just because of a certain social understanding and a social

10:19.637 --> 10:23.237
upliftment you try to be good to others - no.

10:23.441 --> 10:26.956
It is from inside; inside you do it.

10:27.222 --> 10:30.073
This eka karita first must work in the family.

10:30.222 --> 10:34.020
It's very important. The family which is disturbed all the time

10:34.121 --> 10:40.292
cannot create children who are in the state of eka karita.

10:40.510 --> 10:45.042
That's why always tell them that don't fight.

10:45.284 --> 10:50.280
In the family they are fighting, they cannot be Sahaja yogis.

10:50.538 --> 10:53.991
If there is such a fight it is better to get out of such a family.

10:54.147 --> 10:57.579
So we have sanctioned also a divorce.

10:57.702 --> 11:02.922
Any man who is flirting with other women or doing wrong things,

11:03.055 --> 11:05.319
we have asked him to get out of Sahaja Yoga.

11:05.444 --> 11:08.975
The reason is, one bad apple can spoil many apples.

11:09.124 --> 11:13.565
So such a man or such a woman should be kept out of Sahaja Yoga completely

11:13.760 --> 11:17.260
so that there is a better family relationship,

11:17.463 --> 11:20.425
which is very important in Sahaja Yoga.

11:20.550 --> 11:25.560
Your family relationships should be absolutely perfect.

11:25.792 --> 11:31.299
I can't understand: you can't enjoy the company of your wife,

11:31.477 --> 11:34.000
then what are you going to enjoy in this world?

11:34.196 --> 11:40.225
If you cannot enjoy the bliss of your family life, you cannot enjoy anything else.

11:40.467 --> 11:43.888
This very close relationship of husband/wife

11:44.044 --> 11:48.416
is thrown apart because of Ganesha problem only.

11:48.650 --> 11:53.283
If the Ganesha was all right there would have been a perfect union,

11:53.455 --> 11:56.687
perfect understanding between husband and wife.

11:56.842 --> 12:02.968
But that fails, that means there's definitely something wrong with the Shri Ganesha.

12:03.842 --> 12:08.919
Try to correct your own Shri Ganesh than to see to others.

12:09.094 --> 12:14.214
You have to meditate, and meditate on Shri Ganesh,

12:14.370 --> 12:17.929
to sit on the ground and meditate.

12:18.066 --> 12:25.120
In Sahaja Yog the most important thing is to worship Shri Ganesha within you,

12:26.186 --> 12:29.117
and the quality of Shri Ganesha within you.

12:29.240 --> 12:35.235
It's very soothing, it's very peace-giving, it's very secure,

12:35.408 --> 12:40.467
security-creating power.

12:40.600 --> 12:45.276
If your Ganesha is all right nobody can touch you,

12:45.480 --> 12:51.411
nobody can destroy you, nobody can upset you,

12:51.621 --> 12:54.778
because He is the one who is the giver of peace.

12:54.973 --> 12:57.192
The world peace is disturbed because

12:57.310 --> 12:59.708
we have not worshipped Shri Ganesha.

12:59.949 --> 13:02.970
I have seen people in very big positions,

13:03.043 --> 13:05.958
in charge of military, in charge of that, in charge

13:06.119 --> 13:08.119
not in charge of themselves.

13:08.247 --> 13:11.512
Their Ganesha is absolutely ruined and finished.

13:11.645 --> 13:15.871
All such people are such leaders of nations,

13:16.043 --> 13:19.860
and people try to follow them in their own way.

13:20.063 --> 13:23.212
Though they may do something secretly, doesn't matter;

13:23.362 --> 13:25.079
people know about it.

13:25.240 --> 13:28.487
Because in auspiciousness if you are losing,

13:28.620 --> 13:33.230
then the whole world comes to know, somehow.

13:33.508 --> 13:37.908
It will all be exposed, because Satya Yuga has come.

13:38.102 --> 13:43.758
In this new Yuga there's light of the truth within us,

13:44.004 --> 13:52.102
and this truth can expose all that is nonsensical we have been doing.

13:52.472 --> 13:59.992
Now truth is the quality of Shri Ganesh Himself.

14:00.464 --> 14:05.773
He's the one who is giving us truth.

14:06.116 --> 14:12.955
In our brain it comes to us through Jesus Christ.

14:13.824 --> 14:20.131
Jesus Christ has worked so much, He's done so much;

14:20.240 --> 14:25.560
but look at the condition of the people who are supposed to be following Him,

14:26.427 --> 14:29.107
look at the way they are behaving.

14:29.247 --> 14:34.727
Let us at least show that if you follow Ganesha and Jesus Christ,

14:34.806 --> 14:38.966
you are in the image of that personality

14:39.122 --> 14:41.842
which is something so very spiritual.

14:42.053 --> 14:45.453
Spiritual life is the giver of joy.

14:45.507 --> 14:49.641
You cannot get joy out of anything else but spirituality.

14:50.038 --> 14:53.815
You can get some satisfaction, you can get some ego,

14:53.862 --> 14:55.590
you might feel that you are something great,

14:55.788 --> 15:00.209
but the only way you can get the inner peace and joy

15:00.211 --> 15:06.031
is Shri Ganesha's manifestation in all the chakras.

15:06.033 --> 15:08.791
He manifests in all the chakras which,

15:08.793 --> 15:15.317
when you are in a proper state on those chakras,

15:15.348 --> 15:24.136
you get the joy, and that joy comes to you through Shri Ganesh.

15:24.452 --> 15:27.591
I hope you will all meditate now after this

15:27.631 --> 15:30.057
to develop your Ganesha qualities,

15:30.059 --> 15:37.558
and develop that power of chastity, and also of peace and security.

15:37.644 --> 15:39.958
May God bless you.
