WEBVTT

05:34.874 --> 05:47.814
Today we are here, all of us, to celebrate
the Diwali, that is dipavali, meaning the

05:47.814 --> 06:02.744
rows of lights.

06:02.744 --> 06:24.863
In the darkness of Kali Yuga when you find
from every place confusion of the worst type

06:24.863 --> 06:34.444
creating the darkness which cannot be penetrate
into, and which looks like a solid mountain

06:34.444 --> 06:44.594
around us, and which can never be covered,
as we feel, by the grace of God.

06:44.594 --> 06:52.074
And even with the grace of God it would never
melt.

06:52.074 --> 07:09.114
In that darkness, in that hopeless state,
when the creation is on the verge of its destruction,

07:09.114 --> 07:12.474
the light of Sahaja Yoga has arrived.

07:12.474 --> 07:23.694
And you are the lights, you are the dipas,
you are the little, little lights, which were

07:23.694 --> 07:34.484
waiting to be enlightened, to be enlightened
to see for yourself what’s wrong within

07:34.484 --> 07:41.274
your own lamp, what’s missing in your own
lamp.

07:41.274 --> 07:46.964
Now, in the lamp you have three things, as
you see.

07:46.964 --> 07:48.435
One is the container.

07:48.435 --> 08:02.324
Container is this body, container is this
mind and the container is this intellect.

08:02.324 --> 08:09.094
And the container contains within us itself,
is the oil.

08:09.094 --> 08:16.054
In Sanskrit language it’s called as snigdha
or sneha, means the love.

08:16.054 --> 08:25.514
Is the love that is within your mind, within
your body, within your existence itself.

08:25.514 --> 08:33.454
But this love is now limited, it is in a dormant
state.

08:33.454 --> 08:43.054
It doesn’t express itself, it can spill
out in wrong directions, it may spoil some

08:43.054 --> 08:45.364
things, which are beautiful.

08:45.364 --> 08:50.894
This love, when it is limited, is very dangerous.

08:50.894 --> 09:00.534
But when there is a third thing within you,
which we call as the baati, is the wick.

09:00.534 --> 09:09.164
And this wick is the pure desire within you,
which is not yet lightened – it is not aware

09:09.164 --> 09:10.724
of itself.

09:10.724 --> 09:18.564
Nobody is aware, the lamp is not aware that
there is a light within itself.

09:18.564 --> 09:26.484
All these three things have to combine to
give that light because we are lost in so

09:26.484 --> 09:27.814
many things.

09:27.814 --> 09:33.854
This darkness of Kali Yuga is not one-sided.

09:33.854 --> 09:46.004
If you see it clearly it is not only materialism,
adherence to money, adherence to money-power,

09:46.004 --> 09:48.543
it’s not only that.

09:48.543 --> 09:53.934
That’s, of course, is very important these
days, we cannot neglect it, because that’s

09:53.934 --> 10:04.244
something is really weighing this whole balance
of the Western world.

10:04.244 --> 10:08.814
But this money is for power.

10:08.814 --> 10:11.754
Why money?

10:11.754 --> 10:15.234
Because it has a power, according to many
people who are blind.

10:15.234 --> 10:25.214
They think money has the power to win-over
people, to exist in higher powers of, say,

10:25.214 --> 10:32.154
execution of their administration and all
that you need money.

10:32.154 --> 10:34.154
To win our votes, to get elected.

10:34.154 --> 10:39.614
That’s the myth people are carrying all
the time, that money is very important, and

10:39.614 --> 10:42.974
without money you can’t manage things.

10:42.974 --> 10:50.234
And also because of this kind of a misunderstanding
about money people get very much impressed

10:50.234 --> 10:57.314
by the people who have money, and they think,
“Now, this is the time we must really gather

10:57.314 --> 10:59.274
money somehow or other.”

10:59.274 --> 11:04.414
Try to get money out of every kind of a adharma.

11:04.414 --> 11:07.304
“What’s wrong?”

11:07.304 --> 11:12.994
So this money orientation has gone in this
Kali Yuga to such a limit, that the sense

11:12.994 --> 11:18.374
of chastity is lost, the sense of creativity
is lost – because you must create something

11:18.374 --> 11:20.004
that must sell.

11:20.004 --> 11:22.554
If it cannot sell then you should not.

11:22.554 --> 11:27.344
Then, the sense of Dharma is lost, there is
no Dharma.

11:27.344 --> 11:30.193
When it comes to making money, what is the
Dharma?

11:30.193 --> 11:32.334
There is no Dharma needed.

11:32.334 --> 11:35.484
Only Dharma is how to make money.

11:35.484 --> 11:39.114
Then, of course, the love.

11:39.114 --> 11:44.334
The mothers don’t want children because
they have to spend money on their children.

11:44.334 --> 11:50.114
It is the conceive, a selfishness that starts
working.

11:50.114 --> 11:55.344
And people start thinking about, “How we
can grab money from others?”

11:55.344 --> 12:00.444
There are many sophisticated ways of grabbing
money also in the modern times.

12:00.444 --> 12:06.244
And the sophistication has reached such subtleties
that a person doesn’t know until he is completely

12:06.244 --> 12:07.824
robbed.

12:07.824 --> 12:18.884
Now, there are other ways of getting money,
is now that the kind of a music nowadays people

12:18.884 --> 12:24.814
are having – which is against God – it
doesn’t sing the praise of God, but it’s

12:24.814 --> 12:27.454
just a noise that they make.

12:27.454 --> 12:30.054
If you sing the praise of God it’s different.

12:30.054 --> 12:35.504
But otherwise this kind of music that they
have, actually works on your limbic area.

12:35.504 --> 12:42.084
And the limbic area has the capacity to give
you joy and happiness, and this limbic area

12:42.084 --> 12:49.254
becomes numb because of this music, of this
horrible music of modern times.

12:49.254 --> 12:57.104
When it becomes numb then what you do is to
have more noise and more noise and more noise,

12:57.104 --> 13:44.044
to give a sensation to the limbic area.

13:44.044 --> 13:51.094
So the limbic area when it becomes sensation-less
they don’t know how to give it a sensation,

13:51.094 --> 13:57.184
so they take to drugs, you have to take to
drugs, you can’t help it, because all the

13:57.184 --> 13:58.354
sensation is lost.

13:58.354 --> 14:04.983
So, in the name of also anti-culture, or you
can call an anti-tradition, anti-this and

14:04.983 --> 14:14.183
anti-that, what you develop is a limbic area
which requires sensations.

14:14.183 --> 14:20.754
Now the music fetches money, because it’s
like drug, it’s like any alcohol, it’s

14:20.754 --> 14:23.403
any intoxication.

14:23.403 --> 14:28.913
Because already the nerves are intoxicated.

14:28.913 --> 14:39.024
Even alcohol works the same way, even other
things like drugs also work the same way.

14:39.024 --> 14:44.624
So, in that intoxication you really do not
know what are you up to.

14:44.624 --> 14:52.553
A kind of another darkness, another blindness
comes over.

14:52.553 --> 14:59.644
So in this darkness – this another additional
darkness makes people much more blind, much

14:59.644 --> 15:03.053
more understanding.

15:03.053 --> 15:11.564
This then takes us to the problem of the body
that exists, of the mind that exists, of the

15:11.564 --> 15:14.104
intellect that exists.

15:14.104 --> 15:22.793
When the whole thing is directed towards money-orientation
we put our body for sale.

15:22.793 --> 15:33.423
We want to make our body look like nothing
on earth, I could say, like some sort of a

15:33.423 --> 15:39.684
tuberculosis patient as they say (Laughter),
or mosquitoes.

15:39.684 --> 15:45.733
Because that makes people have some pity I
think, but inside exists a terribly, a shrew

15:45.733 --> 15:49.963
type of a temperament in a man or a woman.

15:49.963 --> 15:55.963
The whole thing is done by entrepreneurs,
if you see that because they want to produce

15:55.963 --> 16:00.583
things and they want to create images by which
you have to live.

16:00.583 --> 16:07.463
And if you have to live with those images
you have to take to the kind of things they

16:07.463 --> 16:13.913
are producing and that’s how you try to
use those things and you become just a slave

16:13.913 --> 16:14.983
to those entrepreneurs.

16:14.983 --> 16:23.314
It has gone too far – it has gone too far
into the production of things where you have

16:23.314 --> 16:33.233
to play into the hands of entrepreneurs.

16:33.233 --> 16:41.783
We have so many diseases in our country and
these diseases are very modern, meant only

16:41.783 --> 16:43.113
for modern men.

16:43.113 --> 16:48.744
In the older days people didn’t know these
diseases – must be having one or two, but

16:48.744 --> 16:51.103
not many.

16:51.103 --> 16:58.283
So these diseases also come out of the fact
that most of the things we eat or most of

16:58.283 --> 17:07.434
the things we do are just the games of the
entrepreneurs.

17:07.434 --> 17:13.783
Nothing fresh, nothing genuine, nothing sensible
is produced.

17:13.783 --> 17:24.353
Wants are created that you must have at least
ten dresses, all made of pure plastic (Laughter)

17:24.353 --> 17:33.113
– which reacts, which reacts and which creates
problems.

17:33.113 --> 17:45.403
Then you should have all kinds of other materials,
which are absolutely harmless and are anti-human

17:45.403 --> 17:46.923
beings.

17:46.923 --> 17:51.994
All machinery is for us, we are not for machinery.

17:51.994 --> 17:54.004
So we have to give a balance.

17:54.004 --> 18:00.843
Whatever we need can be done through the machinery,
but when machinery becomes the only source

18:00.843 --> 18:04.023
of exploitation it starts dominating us.

18:04.023 --> 18:13.684
See, if you go to the darkness of this Kali
Yuga – it’s so deep, it’s so horrid

18:13.684 --> 18:19.593
and it’s so dangerous and destructive that
the description of it can take you to any

18:19.593 --> 18:28.303
land and you will not even feel that you are
getting into the mire deep, deep, deep into

18:28.303 --> 18:35.583
it, that you cannot come out of it.

18:35.583 --> 18:47.214
So the antidote has come now as Sahaja Yoga
– the Diwali, the dipavali of the Sahaja

18:47.214 --> 18:48.293
Yogis.

18:48.293 --> 18:53.603
See now, after Realization you don’t need
beauty-treatment much.

18:53.603 --> 19:01.814
You don’t need so many plastic clothes (Laughter).

19:01.814 --> 19:10.833
You don’t indulge into all kinds of stupid
activities which are joyless.

19:10.833 --> 19:12.913
You don’t take to drugs.

19:12.913 --> 19:14.783
You don’t take to smoking.

19:14.783 --> 19:22.504
You don’t take to alcohols and you don’t
take to this horrid music also.

19:22.504 --> 19:31.574
On the contrary you take to the music that
pacifies, which sooths your limbic area, which

19:31.574 --> 19:33.843
gives joy.

19:33.843 --> 19:41.644
So you indulge into all the pursuits which
will give you joy, start giving up gradually.

19:41.644 --> 19:46.394
Sometimes I have to tell you but then you
understand and you give up all those things

19:46.394 --> 19:51.634
because then you have tasted the joy, you
know what this joy is, you know the ambrosia

19:51.634 --> 19:53.113
of joy, so you don’t want to give it up.

19:53.113 --> 19:57.814
You may, little bit, give it up, then again
you come back.

19:57.814 --> 19:59.963
You know this is joy.

19:59.963 --> 20:04.913
Joy doesn’t lie in money, doesn’t lie
in all these joyless pursuits, nothing, but

20:04.913 --> 20:11.033
joy lies in your Spirit, and the Spirit is
the one that enjoys the joy.

20:11.033 --> 20:22.053
So, this Spirit is the one, which you see
burning at the end of your Kundalini – on

20:22.053 --> 20:23.853
top of your Sahasrara.

20:23.853 --> 20:29.703
And you have seen the photograph, on top of
your Sahasrara you see the beautiful flame

20:29.703 --> 20:31.603
burning.

20:31.603 --> 20:32.994
You have seen that photograph.

20:32.994 --> 20:40.134
It’s the proof that now you are all the
lights, and that you have to give lights to

20:40.134 --> 20:41.824
others.

20:41.824 --> 20:43.523
You have to help people.

20:43.523 --> 20:48.853
Now, all your faces look like roses, anybody
can see you and can make out that you are

20:48.853 --> 20:50.333
something special people.

20:50.333 --> 20:56.903
You are not like ordinary people who look
so miserable, horrible – and when you sing

20:56.903 --> 21:04.014
in that style also, you are singing God’s
sake, in every style, whatever you sing, which

21:04.014 --> 21:10.763
was once upon a time was regarded as anti-God
singing becomes something great.

21:10.763 --> 21:19.353
So now the light of Sahaja Yoga has kindled
within you all these small, small lights,

21:19.353 --> 21:25.374
which are going to enlighten the path for
humanity, for their emancipation.

21:25.374 --> 21:29.564
So responsibility of Sahaja Yogis are great.

21:29.564 --> 21:35.573
They should get over all these limitations,
like the light has got over all the limitations

21:35.573 --> 21:37.713
and spread all over.

21:37.713 --> 21:45.324
If you have a way of measuring how far this
little light has gone you cannot measure it

21:45.324 --> 21:47.363
with ordinary human instruments.

21:47.363 --> 21:55.103
But once it starts it is spread to the last
bit of it and comes back to it.

21:55.103 --> 22:06.084
In the same way this light which is kindled
within you spreads all over, is emitted all

22:06.084 --> 22:09.353
over and comes back to you.

22:09.353 --> 22:14.633
But of course it is just a material light.

22:14.633 --> 22:17.093
This is a spiritual light.

22:17.093 --> 22:23.343
The difference is this light has its own power
of burning, that’s all.

22:23.343 --> 22:29.133
Also it has a power of giving some light in
the darkness.

22:29.133 --> 22:36.404
Also it has one more thing, that it can enlighten
another light.

22:36.404 --> 22:45.244
But a Sahaja Yogi is not only the light himself,
but also the one who can go to others.

22:45.244 --> 22:46.613
It cannot walk.

22:46.613 --> 22:51.784
When it walks it is fire.

22:51.784 --> 22:54.404
It cannot walk in it’s own limitations.

22:54.404 --> 22:56.363
Somebody has to carry it.

22:56.363 --> 23:03.384
So the Sahaja Yogis are the ones who can carry
this light within themselves – very well

23:03.384 --> 23:09.534
preserved and very beautifully enlighten another
person.

23:09.534 --> 23:13.594
Without creating a fire, without burning anything.

23:13.594 --> 23:18.494
You move this from here to there one has to
think thrice if you can move because you may

23:18.494 --> 23:22.064
spill something or you may burn something.

23:22.064 --> 23:24.714
But not a Sahaja Yogi.

23:24.714 --> 23:28.724
And it is for the redemption.

23:28.724 --> 23:33.854
This can give you light, which is outside,
by which you can see only – but you cannot

23:33.854 --> 23:39.793
feel and you cannot cure.

23:39.793 --> 23:50.114
You cannot give counsel, nor can you comfort
and you cannot redeem with this material.

23:50.114 --> 23:53.344
It is spiritual light that is within us.

23:53.344 --> 23:55.803
So today is a celebration of real Diwali.

23:55.803 --> 24:07.184
I always say that in India we were producing
the Diwali-lights with ordinary mud, but now,

24:07.184 --> 24:15.034
in Sahaja Yoga, we have lotuses which are
giving light, the fragrance.

24:15.034 --> 24:20.934
Such beautiful things they are and the way
you are enjoying it and expressing your joy

24:20.934 --> 24:23.994
is so very beautiful.

24:23.994 --> 24:33.823
But to be the lotus you have to give up this
mud, this darkness – you have to give up

24:33.823 --> 24:34.823
that.

24:34.823 --> 24:45.354
If you can’t give up that, then you cannot
enjoy your own lotus and others can’t enjoy.

24:45.354 --> 24:47.904
So that giving-up is not difficult.

24:47.904 --> 24:52.084
You see, when people say that, “You have
to love your Mother”, just means that you

24:52.084 --> 24:56.534
give up your ego and your conditionings and
become a pure personality, that’s all.

24:56.534 --> 25:01.543
I mean, in any case all of you love Me but
still under limitations.

25:01.543 --> 25:08.354
You must love Me without limitations, then
it is a real love as I love you.

25:08.354 --> 25:12.024
For this we have to thank this time.

25:12.024 --> 25:13.303
This time is great.

25:13.303 --> 25:18.073
As I call it the blossom time, that at this
time you were all born and at this time I

25:18.073 --> 25:23.984
came and at this time this combination took
place and at this time Sahaja Yoga was established.

25:23.984 --> 25:28.654
You don’t know, I have gone through very
great difficulties in the beginning.

25:28.654 --> 25:30.124
Very great difficulties.

25:30.124 --> 25:34.364
Because Sahaja Yoga cannot be understood by
idiots.

25:34.364 --> 25:40.264
And first I met only idiots in My life (Laughter),
quite a lot of idiots.

25:40.264 --> 25:43.344
As Christ has said, “The first will be the
last”, you see.

25:43.344 --> 25:47.673
Perhaps those idiots that I’ve met have
created lots of problems for Me.

25:47.673 --> 25:50.124
But then real people started coming to Me.

25:50.124 --> 25:56.634
They understood Sahaja Yoga, they took to
Sahaja Yog’ and it worked out very well.

25:56.634 --> 25:59.823
Now we have plans to go to India.

25:59.823 --> 26:07.774
The speciality of Indian Tour is that India,
as you know, is a place of quite lot of work

26:07.774 --> 26:11.994
done by the great saints, especially Maharashtra.

26:11.994 --> 26:18.744
Apart from that it’s a very, very Holy Land,
no doubt about it, it’s very clean.

26:18.744 --> 26:23.114
Still the people have not taken to materialism
to that extent.

26:23.114 --> 26:28.694
And thirdly we have about eight pujas in such
a short time.

26:28.694 --> 26:30.974
Of course, it is too much for Me, sometimes.

26:30.974 --> 26:36.804
But we have eight pujas, and this is something
so intensive, one can do it.

26:36.804 --> 26:42.823
This I can’t do anywhere else, as I can
do in India, because only in India the atmosphere,

26:42.823 --> 26:46.964
the vibrations are sucked in, much faster
they are sucked than anywhere.

26:46.964 --> 26:52.663
Because the darkness is not so much there,
and the light spreads much faster, much more

26:52.663 --> 26:56.794
easily, and I can find it easier to work it
out.

26:56.794 --> 27:01.914
I’m sure those days will come everywhere,
when you put up your lights and you start

27:01.914 --> 27:03.094
working it out.

27:03.094 --> 27:11.104
I must congratulate all of you that you are
the ones, who are stuck-on to this darkness

27:11.104 --> 27:17.754
and have created such a light with such responsibility,
with such understanding, with all the struggles

27:17.754 --> 27:24.823
you had to go through, getting out of your
very limited basic problems.

27:24.823 --> 27:30.724
It is remarkable the way you people have established
it, it’s unbelievable, because, you see,

27:30.724 --> 27:36.994
you could have just said that, “This is
some philosophy, we don’t believe it.

27:36.994 --> 27:40.443
This is something that we don’t understand.”

27:40.443 --> 27:44.734
But it’s so congenial to you, because you
have become the Spirit.

27:44.734 --> 27:49.214
Christ has said the same thing, but how many
have understood Christ?

27:49.214 --> 27:53.434
Nobody has understood Christ, I think, till
it came through Christianity.

27:53.434 --> 27:57.264
When it came through Sahaja Yoga you have
understood who He was.

27:57.264 --> 28:05.314
In the same way for all other great prophets,
all other great Incarnations, you had to come

28:05.314 --> 28:10.644
to Sahaja Yoga, to see in that light how great
they were, how much work they have done for

28:10.644 --> 28:14.994
us, how much they have established us, how
much we should be thankful to you.

28:14.994 --> 28:20.303
I hope one day you can see all of them sitting
with us and you can locate them, wherever

28:20.303 --> 28:21.443
they are.

28:21.443 --> 28:27.524
Those eyes you should develop one day, to
see all that, which your camera can see, sometimes.

28:27.524 --> 28:30.745
And in the same way you should be able to
see, it will be a very good idea.

28:30.745 --> 28:36.134
I think in Bogotha some of the Sahaja Yogis
did see the grace falling down, that’s all,

28:36.134 --> 28:37.134
once.

28:37.134 --> 28:38.904
But it will happen more and more.

28:38.904 --> 28:46.734
Please try to improve your eye, in the sense
that, ‘Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes’.

28:46.734 --> 28:50.674
Have no greed in your eye, for anything!

28:50.674 --> 28:56.474
Try to remove the greed from your eye and
it will definitely start working out.

28:56.474 --> 29:04.423
So this is the message for our eyes because
through the eyes you are the light.

29:04.423 --> 29:11.014
First thing that I have kindled is the light
in your eyes, and that’s what is the light

29:11.014 --> 29:18.904
is to be improved, to be purified with love
– with the Divine Love.

29:18.904 --> 29:20.323
May God bless you all!
