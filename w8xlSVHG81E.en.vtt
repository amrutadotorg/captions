00:05:34.874 --> 00:05:47.814
Today we are here, all of us, to celebrate
the Diwali, that is dipavali, meaning the

00:05:47.814 --> 00:06:02.744
rows of lights.

00:06:02.744 --> 00:06:24.863
In the darkness of Kali Yuga when you find
from every place confusion of the worst type

00:06:24.863 --> 00:06:34.444
creating the darkness which cannot be penetrate
into, and which looks like a solid mountain

00:06:34.444 --> 00:06:44.594
around us, and which can never be covered,
as we feel, by the grace of God.

00:06:44.594 --> 00:06:52.074
And even with the grace of God it would never
melt.

00:06:52.074 --> 00:07:09.114
In that darkness, in that hopeless state,
when the creation is on the verge of its destruction,

00:07:09.114 --> 00:07:12.474
the light of Sahaja Yoga has arrived.

00:07:12.474 --> 00:07:23.694
And you are the lights, you are the dipas,
you are the little, little lights, which were

00:07:23.694 --> 00:07:34.484
waiting to be enlightened, to be enlightened
to see for yourself what’s wrong within

00:07:34.484 --> 00:07:41.274
your own lamp, what’s missing in your own
lamp.

00:07:41.274 --> 00:07:46.964
Now, in the lamp you have three things, as
you see.

00:07:46.964 --> 00:07:48.435
One is the container.

00:07:48.435 --> 00:08:02.324
Container is this body, container is this
mind and the container is this intellect.

00:08:02.324 --> 00:08:09.094
And the container contains within us itself,
is the oil.

00:08:09.094 --> 00:08:16.054
In Sanskrit language it’s called as snigdha
or sneha, means the love.

00:08:16.054 --> 00:08:25.514
Is the love that is within your mind, within
your body, within your existence itself.

00:08:25.514 --> 00:08:33.454
But this love is now limited, it is in a dormant
state.

00:08:33.454 --> 00:08:43.054
It doesn’t express itself, it can spill
out in wrong directions, it may spoil some

00:08:43.054 --> 00:08:45.364
things, which are beautiful.

00:08:45.364 --> 00:08:50.894
This love, when it is limited, is very dangerous.

00:08:50.894 --> 00:09:00.534
But when there is a third thing within you,
which we call as the baati, is the wick.

00:09:00.534 --> 00:09:09.164
And this wick is the pure desire within you,
which is not yet lightened – it is not aware

00:09:09.164 --> 00:09:10.724
of itself.

00:09:10.724 --> 00:09:18.564
Nobody is aware, the lamp is not aware that
there is a light within itself.

00:09:18.564 --> 00:09:26.484
All these three things have to combine to
give that light because we are lost in so

00:09:26.484 --> 00:09:27.814
many things.

00:09:27.814 --> 00:09:33.854
This darkness of Kali Yuga is not one-sided.

00:09:33.854 --> 00:09:46.004
If you see it clearly it is not only materialism,
adherence to money, adherence to money-power,

00:09:46.004 --> 00:09:48.543
it’s not only that.

00:09:48.543 --> 00:09:53.934
That’s, of course, is very important these
days, we cannot neglect it, because that’s

00:09:53.934 --> 00:10:04.244
something is really weighing this whole balance
of the Western world.

00:10:04.244 --> 00:10:08.814
But this money is for power.

00:10:08.814 --> 00:10:11.754
Why money?

00:10:11.754 --> 00:10:15.234
Because it has a power, according to many
people who are blind.

00:10:15.234 --> 00:10:25.214
They think money has the power to win-over
people, to exist in higher powers of, say,

00:10:25.214 --> 00:10:32.154
execution of their administration and all
that you need money.

00:10:32.154 --> 00:10:34.154
To win our votes, to get elected.

00:10:34.154 --> 00:10:39.614
That’s the myth people are carrying all
the time, that money is very important, and

00:10:39.614 --> 00:10:42.974
without money you can’t manage things.

00:10:42.974 --> 00:10:50.234
And also because of this kind of a misunderstanding
about money people get very much impressed

00:10:50.234 --> 00:10:57.314
by the people who have money, and they think,
“Now, this is the time we must really gather

00:10:57.314 --> 00:10:59.274
money somehow or other.”

00:10:59.274 --> 00:11:04.414
Try to get money out of every kind of a adharma.

00:11:04.414 --> 00:11:07.304
“What’s wrong?”

00:11:07.304 --> 00:11:12.994
So this money orientation has gone in this
Kali Yuga to such a limit, that the sense

00:11:12.994 --> 00:11:18.374
of chastity is lost, the sense of creativity
is lost – because you must create something

00:11:18.374 --> 00:11:20.004
that must sell.

00:11:20.004 --> 00:11:22.554
If it cannot sell then you should not.

00:11:22.554 --> 00:11:27.344
Then, the sense of Dharma is lost, there is
no Dharma.

00:11:27.344 --> 00:11:30.193
When it comes to making money, what is the
Dharma?

00:11:30.193 --> 00:11:32.334
There is no Dharma needed.

00:11:32.334 --> 00:11:35.484
Only Dharma is how to make money.

00:11:35.484 --> 00:11:39.114
Then, of course, the love.

00:11:39.114 --> 00:11:44.334
The mothers don’t want children because
they have to spend money on their children.

00:11:44.334 --> 00:11:50.114
It is the conceive, a selfishness that starts
working.

00:11:50.114 --> 00:11:55.344
And people start thinking about, “How we
can grab money from others?”

00:11:55.344 --> 00:12:00.444
There are many sophisticated ways of grabbing
money also in the modern times.

00:12:00.444 --> 00:12:06.244
And the sophistication has reached such subtleties
that a person doesn’t know until he is completely

00:12:06.244 --> 00:12:07.824
robbed.

00:12:07.824 --> 00:12:18.884
Now, there are other ways of getting money,
is now that the kind of a music nowadays people

00:12:18.884 --> 00:12:24.814
are having – which is against God – it
doesn’t sing the praise of God, but it’s

00:12:24.814 --> 00:12:27.454
just a noise that they make.

00:12:27.454 --> 00:12:30.054
If you sing the praise of God it’s different.

00:12:30.054 --> 00:12:35.504
But otherwise this kind of music that they
have, actually works on your limbic area.

00:12:35.504 --> 00:12:42.084
And the limbic area has the capacity to give
you joy and happiness, and this limbic area

00:12:42.084 --> 00:12:49.254
becomes numb because of this music, of this
horrible music of modern times.

00:12:49.254 --> 00:12:57.104
When it becomes numb then what you do is to
have more noise and more noise and more noise,

00:12:57.104 --> 00:13:44.044
to give a sensation to the limbic area.

00:13:44.044 --> 00:13:51.094
So the limbic area when it becomes sensation-less
they don’t know how to give it a sensation,

00:13:51.094 --> 00:13:57.184
so they take to drugs, you have to take to
drugs, you can’t help it, because all the

00:13:57.184 --> 00:13:58.354
sensation is lost.

00:13:58.354 --> 00:14:04.983
So, in the name of also anti-culture, or you
can call an anti-tradition, anti-this and

00:14:04.983 --> 00:14:14.183
anti-that, what you develop is a limbic area
which requires sensations.

00:14:14.183 --> 00:14:20.754
Now the music fetches money, because it’s
like drug, it’s like any alcohol, it’s

00:14:20.754 --> 00:14:23.403
any intoxication.

00:14:23.403 --> 00:14:28.913
Because already the nerves are intoxicated.

00:14:28.913 --> 00:14:39.024
Even alcohol works the same way, even other
things like drugs also work the same way.

00:14:39.024 --> 00:14:44.624
So, in that intoxication you really do not
know what are you up to.

00:14:44.624 --> 00:14:52.553
A kind of another darkness, another blindness
comes over.

00:14:52.553 --> 00:14:59.644
So in this darkness – this another additional
darkness makes people much more blind, much

00:14:59.644 --> 00:15:03.053
more understanding.

00:15:03.053 --> 00:15:11.564
This then takes us to the problem of the body
that exists, of the mind that exists, of the

00:15:11.564 --> 00:15:14.104
intellect that exists.

00:15:14.104 --> 00:15:22.793
When the whole thing is directed towards money-orientation
we put our body for sale.

00:15:22.793 --> 00:15:33.423
We want to make our body look like nothing
on earth, I could say, like some sort of a

00:15:33.423 --> 00:15:39.684
tuberculosis patient as they say (Laughter),
or mosquitoes.

00:15:39.684 --> 00:15:45.733
Because that makes people have some pity I
think, but inside exists a terribly, a shrew

00:15:45.733 --> 00:15:49.963
type of a temperament in a man or a woman.

00:15:49.963 --> 00:15:55.963
The whole thing is done by entrepreneurs,
if you see that because they want to produce

00:15:55.963 --> 00:16:00.583
things and they want to create images by which
you have to live.

00:16:00.583 --> 00:16:07.463
And if you have to live with those images
you have to take to the kind of things they

00:16:07.463 --> 00:16:13.913
are producing and that’s how you try to
use those things and you become just a slave

00:16:13.913 --> 00:16:14.983
to those entrepreneurs.

00:16:14.983 --> 00:16:23.314
It has gone too far – it has gone too far
into the production of things where you have

00:16:23.314 --> 00:16:33.233
to play into the hands of entrepreneurs.

00:16:33.233 --> 00:16:41.783
We have so many diseases in our country and
these diseases are very modern, meant only

00:16:41.783 --> 00:16:43.113
for modern men.

00:16:43.113 --> 00:16:48.744
In the older days people didn’t know these
diseases – must be having one or two, but

00:16:48.744 --> 00:16:51.103
not many.

00:16:51.103 --> 00:16:58.283
So these diseases also come out of the fact
that most of the things we eat or most of

00:16:58.283 --> 00:17:07.434
the things we do are just the games of the
entrepreneurs.

00:17:07.434 --> 00:17:13.783
Nothing fresh, nothing genuine, nothing sensible
is produced.

00:17:13.783 --> 00:17:24.353
Wants are created that you must have at least
ten dresses, all made of pure plastic (Laughter)

00:17:24.353 --> 00:17:33.113
– which reacts, which reacts and which creates
problems.

00:17:33.113 --> 00:17:45.403
Then you should have all kinds of other materials,
which are absolutely harmless and are anti-human

00:17:45.403 --> 00:17:46.923
beings.

00:17:46.923 --> 00:17:51.994
All machinery is for us, we are not for machinery.

00:17:51.994 --> 00:17:54.004
So we have to give a balance.

00:17:54.004 --> 00:18:00.843
Whatever we need can be done through the machinery,
but when machinery becomes the only source

00:18:00.843 --> 00:18:04.023
of exploitation it starts dominating us.

00:18:04.023 --> 00:18:13.684
See, if you go to the darkness of this Kali
Yuga – it’s so deep, it’s so horrid

00:18:13.684 --> 00:18:19.593
and it’s so dangerous and destructive that
the description of it can take you to any

00:18:19.593 --> 00:18:28.303
land and you will not even feel that you are
getting into the mire deep, deep, deep into

00:18:28.303 --> 00:18:35.583
it, that you cannot come out of it.

00:18:35.583 --> 00:18:47.214
So the antidote has come now as Sahaja Yoga
– the Diwali, the dipavali of the Sahaja

00:18:47.214 --> 00:18:48.293
Yogis.

00:18:48.293 --> 00:18:53.603
See now, after Realization you don’t need
beauty-treatment much.

00:18:53.603 --> 00:19:01.814
You don’t need so many plastic clothes (Laughter).

00:19:01.814 --> 00:19:10.833
You don’t indulge into all kinds of stupid
activities which are joyless.

00:19:10.833 --> 00:19:12.913
You don’t take to drugs.

00:19:12.913 --> 00:19:14.783
You don’t take to smoking.

00:19:14.783 --> 00:19:22.504
You don’t take to alcohols and you don’t
take to this horrid music also.

00:19:22.504 --> 00:19:31.574
On the contrary you take to the music that
pacifies, which sooths your limbic area, which

00:19:31.574 --> 00:19:33.843
gives joy.

00:19:33.843 --> 00:19:41.644
So you indulge into all the pursuits which
will give you joy, start giving up gradually.

00:19:41.644 --> 00:19:46.394
Sometimes I have to tell you but then you
understand and you give up all those things

00:19:46.394 --> 00:19:51.634
because then you have tasted the joy, you
know what this joy is, you know the ambrosia

00:19:51.634 --> 00:19:53.113
of joy, so you don’t want to give it up.

00:19:53.113 --> 00:19:57.814
You may, little bit, give it up, then again
you come back.

00:19:57.814 --> 00:19:59.963
You know this is joy.

00:19:59.963 --> 00:20:04.913
Joy doesn’t lie in money, doesn’t lie
in all these joyless pursuits, nothing, but

00:20:04.913 --> 00:20:11.033
joy lies in your Spirit, and the Spirit is
the one that enjoys the joy.

00:20:11.033 --> 00:20:22.053
So, this Spirit is the one, which you see
burning at the end of your Kundalini – on

00:20:22.053 --> 00:20:23.853
top of your Sahasrara.

00:20:23.853 --> 00:20:29.703
And you have seen the photograph, on top of
your Sahasrara you see the beautiful flame

00:20:29.703 --> 00:20:31.603
burning.

00:20:31.603 --> 00:20:32.994
You have seen that photograph.

00:20:32.994 --> 00:20:40.134
It’s the proof that now you are all the
lights, and that you have to give lights to

00:20:40.134 --> 00:20:41.824
others.

00:20:41.824 --> 00:20:43.523
You have to help people.

00:20:43.523 --> 00:20:48.853
Now, all your faces look like roses, anybody
can see you and can make out that you are

00:20:48.853 --> 00:20:50.333
something special people.

00:20:50.333 --> 00:20:56.903
You are not like ordinary people who look
so miserable, horrible – and when you sing

00:20:56.903 --> 00:21:04.014
in that style also, you are singing God’s
sake, in every style, whatever you sing, which

00:21:04.014 --> 00:21:10.763
was once upon a time was regarded as anti-God
singing becomes something great.

00:21:10.763 --> 00:21:19.353
So now the light of Sahaja Yoga has kindled
within you all these small, small lights,

00:21:19.353 --> 00:21:25.374
which are going to enlighten the path for
humanity, for their emancipation.

00:21:25.374 --> 00:21:29.564
So responsibility of Sahaja Yogis are great.

00:21:29.564 --> 00:21:35.573
They should get over all these limitations,
like the light has got over all the limitations

00:21:35.573 --> 00:21:37.713
and spread all over.

00:21:37.713 --> 00:21:45.324
If you have a way of measuring how far this
little light has gone you cannot measure it

00:21:45.324 --> 00:21:47.363
with ordinary human instruments.

00:21:47.363 --> 00:21:55.103
But once it starts it is spread to the last
bit of it and comes back to it.

00:21:55.103 --> 00:22:06.084
In the same way this light which is kindled
within you spreads all over, is emitted all

00:22:06.084 --> 00:22:09.353
over and comes back to you.

00:22:09.353 --> 00:22:14.633
But of course it is just a material light.

00:22:14.633 --> 00:22:17.093
This is a spiritual light.

00:22:17.093 --> 00:22:23.343
The difference is this light has its own power
of burning, that’s all.

00:22:23.343 --> 00:22:29.133
Also it has a power of giving some light in
the darkness.

00:22:29.133 --> 00:22:36.404
Also it has one more thing, that it can enlighten
another light.

00:22:36.404 --> 00:22:45.244
But a Sahaja Yogi is not only the light himself,
but also the one who can go to others.

00:22:45.244 --> 00:22:46.613
It cannot walk.

00:22:46.613 --> 00:22:51.784
When it walks it is fire.

00:22:51.784 --> 00:22:54.404
It cannot walk in it’s own limitations.

00:22:54.404 --> 00:22:56.363
Somebody has to carry it.

00:22:56.363 --> 00:23:03.384
So the Sahaja Yogis are the ones who can carry
this light within themselves – very well

00:23:03.384 --> 00:23:09.534
preserved and very beautifully enlighten another
person.

00:23:09.534 --> 00:23:13.594
Without creating a fire, without burning anything.

00:23:13.594 --> 00:23:18.494
You move this from here to there one has to
think thrice if you can move because you may

00:23:18.494 --> 00:23:22.064
spill something or you may burn something.

00:23:22.064 --> 00:23:24.714
But not a Sahaja Yogi.

00:23:24.714 --> 00:23:28.724
And it is for the redemption.

00:23:28.724 --> 00:23:33.854
This can give you light, which is outside,
by which you can see only – but you cannot

00:23:33.854 --> 00:23:39.793
feel and you cannot cure.

00:23:39.793 --> 00:23:50.114
You cannot give counsel, nor can you comfort
and you cannot redeem with this material.

00:23:50.114 --> 00:23:53.344
It is spiritual light that is within us.

00:23:53.344 --> 00:23:55.803
So today is a celebration of real Diwali.

00:23:55.803 --> 00:24:07.184
I always say that in India we were producing
the Diwali-lights with ordinary mud, but now,

00:24:07.184 --> 00:24:15.034
in Sahaja Yoga, we have lotuses which are
giving light, the fragrance.

00:24:15.034 --> 00:24:20.934
Such beautiful things they are and the way
you are enjoying it and expressing your joy

00:24:20.934 --> 00:24:23.994
is so very beautiful.

00:24:23.994 --> 00:24:33.823
But to be the lotus you have to give up this
mud, this darkness – you have to give up

00:24:33.823 --> 00:24:34.823
that.

00:24:34.823 --> 00:24:45.354
If you can’t give up that, then you cannot
enjoy your own lotus and others can’t enjoy.

00:24:45.354 --> 00:24:47.904
So that giving-up is not difficult.

00:24:47.904 --> 00:24:52.084
You see, when people say that, “You have
to love your Mother”, just means that you

00:24:52.084 --> 00:24:56.534
give up your ego and your conditionings and
become a pure personality, that’s all.

00:24:56.534 --> 00:25:01.543
I mean, in any case all of you love Me but
still under limitations.

00:25:01.543 --> 00:25:08.354
You must love Me without limitations, then
it is a real love as I love you.

00:25:08.354 --> 00:25:12.024
For this we have to thank this time.

00:25:12.024 --> 00:25:13.303
This time is great.

00:25:13.303 --> 00:25:18.073
As I call it the blossom time, that at this
time you were all born and at this time I

00:25:18.073 --> 00:25:23.984
came and at this time this combination took
place and at this time Sahaja Yoga was established.

00:25:23.984 --> 00:25:28.654
You don’t know, I have gone through very
great difficulties in the beginning.

00:25:28.654 --> 00:25:30.124
Very great difficulties.

00:25:30.124 --> 00:25:34.364
Because Sahaja Yoga cannot be understood by
idiots.

00:25:34.364 --> 00:25:40.264
And first I met only idiots in My life (Laughter),
quite a lot of idiots.

00:25:40.264 --> 00:25:43.344
As Christ has said, “The first will be the
last”, you see.

00:25:43.344 --> 00:25:47.673
Perhaps those idiots that I’ve met have
created lots of problems for Me.

00:25:47.673 --> 00:25:50.124
But then real people started coming to Me.

00:25:50.124 --> 00:25:56.634
They understood Sahaja Yoga, they took to
Sahaja Yog’ and it worked out very well.

00:25:56.634 --> 00:25:59.823
Now we have plans to go to India.

00:25:59.823 --> 00:26:07.774
The speciality of Indian Tour is that India,
as you know, is a place of quite lot of work

00:26:07.774 --> 00:26:11.994
done by the great saints, especially Maharashtra.

00:26:11.994 --> 00:26:18.744
Apart from that it’s a very, very Holy Land,
no doubt about it, it’s very clean.

00:26:18.744 --> 00:26:23.114
Still the people have not taken to materialism
to that extent.

00:26:23.114 --> 00:26:28.694
And thirdly we have about eight pujas in such
a short time.

00:26:28.694 --> 00:26:30.974
Of course, it is too much for Me, sometimes.

00:26:30.974 --> 00:26:36.804
But we have eight pujas, and this is something
so intensive, one can do it.

00:26:36.804 --> 00:26:42.823
This I can’t do anywhere else, as I can
do in India, because only in India the atmosphere,

00:26:42.823 --> 00:26:46.964
the vibrations are sucked in, much faster
they are sucked than anywhere.

00:26:46.964 --> 00:26:52.663
Because the darkness is not so much there,
and the light spreads much faster, much more

00:26:52.663 --> 00:26:56.794
easily, and I can find it easier to work it
out.

00:26:56.794 --> 00:27:01.914
I’m sure those days will come everywhere,
when you put up your lights and you start

00:27:01.914 --> 00:27:03.094
working it out.

00:27:03.094 --> 00:27:11.104
I must congratulate all of you that you are
the ones, who are stuck-on to this darkness

00:27:11.104 --> 00:27:17.754
and have created such a light with such responsibility,
with such understanding, with all the struggles

00:27:17.754 --> 00:27:24.823
you had to go through, getting out of your
very limited basic problems.

00:27:24.823 --> 00:27:30.724
It is remarkable the way you people have established
it, it’s unbelievable, because, you see,

00:27:30.724 --> 00:27:36.994
you could have just said that, “This is
some philosophy, we don’t believe it.

00:27:36.994 --> 00:27:40.443
This is something that we don’t understand.”

00:27:40.443 --> 00:27:44.734
But it’s so congenial to you, because you
have become the Spirit.

00:27:44.734 --> 00:27:49.214
Christ has said the same thing, but how many
have understood Christ?

00:27:49.214 --> 00:27:53.434
Nobody has understood Christ, I think, till
it came through Christianity.

00:27:53.434 --> 00:27:57.264
When it came through Sahaja Yoga you have
understood who He was.

00:27:57.264 --> 00:28:05.314
In the same way for all other great prophets,
all other great Incarnations, you had to come

00:28:05.314 --> 00:28:10.644
to Sahaja Yoga, to see in that light how great
they were, how much work they have done for

00:28:10.644 --> 00:28:14.994
us, how much they have established us, how
much we should be thankful to you.

00:28:14.994 --> 00:28:20.303
I hope one day you can see all of them sitting
with us and you can locate them, wherever

00:28:20.303 --> 00:28:21.443
they are.

00:28:21.443 --> 00:28:27.524
Those eyes you should develop one day, to
see all that, which your camera can see, sometimes.

00:28:27.524 --> 00:28:30.745
And in the same way you should be able to
see, it will be a very good idea.

00:28:30.745 --> 00:28:36.134
I think in Bogotha some of the Sahaja Yogis
did see the grace falling down, that’s all,

00:28:36.134 --> 00:28:37.134
once.

00:28:37.134 --> 00:28:38.904
But it will happen more and more.

00:28:38.904 --> 00:28:46.734
Please try to improve your eye, in the sense
that, ‘Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes’.

00:28:46.734 --> 00:28:50.674
Have no greed in your eye, for anything!

00:28:50.674 --> 00:28:56.474
Try to remove the greed from your eye and
it will definitely start working out.

00:28:56.474 --> 00:29:04.423
So this is the message for our eyes because
through the eyes you are the light.

00:29:04.423 --> 00:29:11.014
First thing that I have kindled is the light
in your eyes, and that’s what is the light

00:29:11.014 --> 00:29:18.904
is to be improved, to be purified with love
– with the Divine Love.

00:29:18.904 --> 00:29:20.323
May God bless you all!
