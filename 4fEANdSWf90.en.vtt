00:03.213 --> 00:07.240
But first of all, people do not understand that
you have to work it

00:07.320 --> 00:10.003
through your heart and not\hthrough your brain.

00:10.119 --> 00:14.350
When we have to work out
things through our brain, we try to develop\h\hour brain,

00:14.529 --> 00:16.057
isn’t it?

00:16.137 --> 00:19.558
By memorizing, by practising\hsomething,

00:19.638 --> 00:23.573
teaching our brain how to think, how to go this way that way.

00:23.953 --> 00:25.978
We try to train our brain.

00:26.058 --> 00:29.377
Now, we have to train our heart in Sahaja Yoga.

00:30.033 --> 00:33.345
And to train our heart in Sahaja Yoga,

00:33.895 --> 00:36.054
one has to\hknow, first of all,

00:36.141 --> 00:41.793
that it is enveloped either by ego or by superego.

00:42.212 --> 00:45.602
The limbic
area actually represents the heart.

00:47.082 --> 00:53.612
And if there is ego, heart will always be
so-called,

00:53.793 --> 00:57.806
it will not be the real heart that\hwill be working, but it’s only mental,

00:57.886 --> 00:59.280
mental\hprojection.

00:59.514 --> 01:02.333
And you will feel that, “I’m doing\h\hit from my heart.”

01:02.413 --> 01:03.975
But it’s not true.

01:04.744 --> 01:08.574
Now then,\hsupposing,
what should we do if we have ego?

01:09.674 --> 01:14.611
You might say, you should try to sort of tell yourself
that, "That’s not good and this and that

01:14.793 --> 01:18.825
and all\hkinds of mental suggestions"

01:18.970 --> 01:20.961
or autosuggestions\hor this –

01:21.041 --> 01:24.661
the way psychiatrists know that give you suggestions.

01:25.123 --> 01:27.888
That’s again mental.

01:28.105 --> 01:30.949
So,\hthat’s not the way it is going to work out.

01:32.013 --> 01:35.309
We must understand that for that what we have to
do is to

01:35.389 --> 01:37.800
raise the left side and put it to the right side.

01:37.881 --> 01:39.587
There’s no other way out.

01:39.674 --> 01:43.549
You have to just work it out with your hands, your hands are working it out

01:43.629 --> 01:48.040
and not your brain.\hSo use your hands

01:48.214 --> 01:50.256
and the methods of Sahaja Yoga.

01:50.336 --> 01:57.777
Now, everyone must have a regular sitting
in the water

01:57.857 --> 02:00.025
every day, that’s important.

02:00.393 --> 02:04.123
Every morning you must do your meditation.

02:04.203 --> 02:10.100
You have to know that Sahaja Yoga is to
be worked out, it‘s not to be thought out.

02:11.383 --> 02:17.135
You just cannot think about it. Whatever
you may try to do through your thought,

02:17.375 --> 02:22.135
you cannot achieve any results in Sahaja Yoga. You\hhave to use your hands, you have to use your feet,

02:22.413 --> 02:26.793
\h\hyou have to soak your feet in the water because
water is the ocean.

02:26.878 --> 02:32.149
All these five chakras – or,\h\hsay, six chakras

02:32.680 --> 02:36.272
which are — I say five
because the…

02:36.399 --> 02:41.041
one is the Mooladhara Chakra, which is the seven

02:41.121 --> 02:44.929
and the topmost is the brain.

02:45.923 --> 02:49.180
So, in between five chakras which
are there —

02:49.260 --> 02:51.880
are to be handled fully

02:51.960 --> 02:58.028
with the\hidea that they are basically made of matter.

03:00.325 --> 03:03.925
And these five elements constitute

03:05.301 --> 03:08.663
the body of these chakras.

03:09.607 --> 03:13.816
Now, these chakras, if\hthey are to be corrected,

03:13.896 --> 03:19.525
we have to correct them by taking out all the problems of these chakras

03:19.605 --> 03:24.153
into the elements from which they’re coming.

03:24.531 --> 03:29.657
For example, a person who is
a very right-sided person,

03:31.130 --> 03:34.729
so, he has to give a balance by the left-side.

03:35.991 --> 03:40.690
Of course, raising with the hand is
all right. But what about the element?

03:41.025 --> 03:45.973
Right-sided person has all the elements\hwhich give heat:

03:46.198 --> 03:48.135
we can say, the light,

03:48.361 --> 03:50.889
we can say, the fire.

03:50.969 --> 03:54.282
So, for people who are\hright-sided,

03:54.493 --> 03:57.722
the light is not going to help much.

03:59.115 --> 04:04.370
Like, if you put the light before the photograph,
and those who are ego-oriented people

04:04.610 --> 04:07.875
— if you just use the light, it’s not going to work out.

04:08.185 --> 04:11.874
So, what is going to work out is the Mother Earth

04:12.008 --> 04:17.861
and the water element, which is cooling.

04:18.256 --> 04:24.268
Even ice\his very helpful to people who are right-sided.

04:26.275 --> 04:37.091
So, all cooling effects should be used
for correcting your right-sidedness,

04:37.629 --> 04:39.638
so that you cool it down.

04:39.779 --> 04:41.521
Same about food.

04:42.019 --> 04:47.870
In food, those who are right-sided people should
take to foods

04:47.950 --> 04:53.127
which are left-sided, that is carbohydrates, means they should become partly\hvegetarians,

04:53.207 --> 04:55.958
or quite a lot of vegetarians.

04:57.029 --> 05:01.544
And should eat things at the most like chicken,

05:01.798 --> 05:07.135
but\hnot fishes, not seafoods because they are all hot.

05:07.360 --> 05:13.059
That’s how you treat your material side of your
chakras.

05:13.242 --> 05:17.488
Now, the left-sided people should use, again,

05:17.587 --> 05:20.743
the "deepam" is the light or the fire

05:20.907 --> 05:25.081
to\hcorrect their left-side.

05:25.447 --> 05:31.944
Also, in food such people should take more to nitrogenous, means protein

05:32.242 --> 05:37.246
and\hfoods like that. They should take more proteins.

05:38.020 --> 05:43.523
Now, as far as Sahaja Yoga is concerned,

05:43.678 --> 05:46.681
the basic\hthing is Kundalini.

05:46.836 --> 05:52.914
And the Kundalini, as I have told you, is the pure desire.

05:53.118 --> 05:57.718
Again, listen\hto it carefully: pure desire.

05:57.943 --> 06:01.343
That means all other desires are impure.

06:01.499 --> 06:03.393
There’s only one pure\hdesire.

06:03.473 --> 06:06.655
And that is to be one with the Divine,

06:06.820 --> 06:12.274
one with the Brahma, one with God — that’s the
only pure desire.

06:12.824 --> 06:16.181
All other desires are impure.
