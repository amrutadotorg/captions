00:00:03.213 --> 00:00:07.240
But first of all, people do not understand that
you have to work it

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.003
through your heart and not&nbsp;through your brain.

00:00:10.119 --> 00:00:14.350
When we have to work out
things through our brain, we try to develop&nbsp;&nbsp;our brain,

00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:16.057
isn’t it?

00:00:16.137 --> 00:00:19.558
By memorizing, by practising&nbsp;something,

00:00:19.638 --> 00:00:23.573
teaching our brain how to think, how to go this way that way.

00:00:23.953 --> 00:00:25.978
We try to train our brain.

00:00:26.058 --> 00:00:29.377
Now, we have to train our heart in Sahaja Yoga.

00:00:30.033 --> 00:00:33.345
And to train our heart in Sahaja Yoga,

00:00:33.895 --> 00:00:36.054
one has to&nbsp;know, first of all,

00:00:36.141 --> 00:00:41.793
that it is enveloped either by ego or by superego.

00:00:42.212 --> 00:00:45.602
 The limbic
area actually represents the heart.

00:00:47.082 --> 00:00:53.612
And if there is ego, heart will always be
so-called,

00:00:53.793 --> 00:00:57.806
 it will not be the real heart that&nbsp;will be working, but it’s only mental,

00:00:57.886 --> 00:00:59.280
mental&nbsp;projection.

00:00:59.514 --> 00:01:02.333
And you will feel that, “I’m doing&nbsp;&nbsp;it from my heart.”

00:01:02.413 --> 00:01:03.975
But it’s not true.

00:01:04.744 --> 00:01:08.574
 Now then,&nbsp;supposing,
 what should we do if we have ego?

00:01:09.674 --> 00:01:14.611
You might say, you should try to sort of tell yourself
that, "That’s not good and this and that

00:01:14.793 --> 00:01:18.825
and all&nbsp;kinds of mental suggestions"

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:20.961
or autosuggestions&nbsp;or this –

00:01:21.041 --> 00:01:24.661
the way psychiatrists know that give you suggestions.

00:01:25.123 --> 00:01:27.888
That’s again mental.

00:01:28.105 --> 00:01:30.949
So,&nbsp;that’s not the way it is going to work out.

00:01:32.013 --> 00:01:35.309
We must understand that for that what we have to
do is to

00:01:35.389 --> 00:01:37.800
raise the left side and put it to the right side.

00:01:37.881 --> 00:01:39.587
There’s no other way out.

00:01:39.674 --> 00:01:43.549
You have to just work it out with your hands, your hands are working it out

00:01:43.629 --> 00:01:48.040
and not your brain.&nbsp;So use your hands

00:01:48.214 --> 00:01:50.256
and the methods of Sahaja Yoga.

00:01:50.336 --> 00:01:57.777
Now, everyone must have a regular sitting
in the water

00:01:57.857 --> 00:02:00.025
every day, that’s important.

00:02:00.393 --> 00:02:04.123
Every morning you must do your meditation.

00:02:04.203 --> 00:02:10.100
You have to know that Sahaja Yoga is to
be worked out, it‘s not to be thought out.

00:02:11.383 --> 00:02:17.135
You just cannot think about it. Whatever
you may try to do through your thought,

00:02:17.375 --> 00:02:22.135
you cannot achieve any results in Sahaja Yoga. You&nbsp;have to use your hands, you have to use your feet,

00:02:22.413 --> 00:02:26.793
&nbsp;&nbsp;you have to soak your feet in the water because
water is the ocean.

00:02:26.878 --> 00:02:32.149
All these five chakras – or,&nbsp;&nbsp;say, six chakras

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.272
which are — I say five
because the…

00:02:36.399 --> 00:02:41.041
one is the Mooladhara Chakra, which is the seven

00:02:41.121 --> 00:02:44.929
and the topmost is the brain.

00:02:45.923 --> 00:02:49.180
So, in between five chakras which
are there —

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.880
are to be handled fully

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:58.028
with the&nbsp;idea that they are basically made of matter.

00:03:00.325 --> 00:03:03.925
And these five elements constitute

00:03:05.301 --> 00:03:08.663
the body of these chakras.

00:03:09.607 --> 00:03:13.816
Now, these chakras, if&nbsp;they are to be corrected,

00:03:13.896 --> 00:03:19.525
we have to correct them by taking out all the problems of these chakras

00:03:19.605 --> 00:03:24.153
into the elements from which they’re coming.

00:03:24.531 --> 00:03:29.657
For example, a person who is
a very right-sided person,

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.729
so, he has to give a balance by the left-side.

00:03:35.991 --> 00:03:40.690
Of course, raising with the hand is
all right. But what about the element?

00:03:41.025 --> 00:03:45.973
Right-sided person has all the elements&nbsp;which give heat:

00:03:46.198 --> 00:03:48.135
we can say, the light,

00:03:48.361 --> 00:03:50.889
we can say, the fire.

00:03:50.969 --> 00:03:54.282
So, for people who are&nbsp;right-sided,

00:03:54.493 --> 00:03:57.722
the light is not going to help much.

00:03:59.115 --> 00:04:04.370
Like, if you put the light before the photograph,
and those who are ego-oriented people

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.875
— if you just use the light, it’s not going to work out.

00:04:08.185 --> 00:04:11.874
So, what is going to work out is the Mother Earth

00:04:12.008 --> 00:04:17.861
and the water element, which is cooling.

00:04:18.256 --> 00:04:24.268
Even ice&nbsp;is very helpful to people who are right-sided.

00:04:26.275 --> 00:04:37.091
So, all cooling effects should be used
for correcting your right-sidedness,

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:39.638
so that you cool it down.

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:41.521
Same about food.

00:04:42.019 --> 00:04:47.870
In food, those who are right-sided people should
take to foods

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:53.127
which are left-sided, that is carbohydrates, means they should become partly&nbsp;vegetarians,

00:04:53.207 --> 00:04:55.958
or quite a lot of vegetarians.

00:04:57.029 --> 00:05:01.544
And should eat things at the most like chicken,

00:05:01.798 --> 00:05:07.135
but&nbsp;not fishes, not seafoods because they are all hot.

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:13.059
That’s how you treat your material side of your
chakras.

00:05:13.242 --> 00:05:17.488
Now, the left-sided people should use, again,

00:05:17.587 --> 00:05:20.743
the "deepam" is the light or the fire

00:05:20.907 --> 00:05:25.081
to&nbsp;correct their left-side.

00:05:25.447 --> 00:05:31.944
Also, in food such people should take more to nitrogenous, means protein

00:05:32.242 --> 00:05:37.246
and&nbsp;foods like that. They should take more proteins.

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:43.523
Now, as far as Sahaja Yoga is concerned,

00:05:43.678 --> 00:05:46.681
the basic&nbsp;thing is Kundalini.

00:05:46.836 --> 00:05:52.914
And the Kundalini, as I have told you, is the pure desire.

00:05:53.118 --> 00:05:57.718
Again, listen&nbsp;to it carefully: pure desire.

00:05:57.943 --> 00:06:01.343
That means all other desires are impure.

00:06:01.499 --> 00:06:03.393
There’s only one pure&nbsp;desire.

00:06:03.473 --> 00:06:06.655
And that is to be one with the Divine,

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:12.274
one with the Brahma, one with God — that’s the
only pure desire.

00:06:12.824 --> 00:06:16.181
All other desires are impure.
