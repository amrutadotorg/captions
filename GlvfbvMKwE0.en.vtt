00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:12.095
It's another great pleasure to come to America
to meet you all people here.

00:00:20.709 --> 00:00:27.113
This one, as I have told you, is a very important country

00:00:29.101 --> 00:00:32.323
in the field of spirituality.

00:00:33.196 --> 00:00:37.184
Not because it's a large country

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:44.021
or because it is very prosperous,

00:00:44.754 --> 00:00:56.117
but because, as you know, it is the Vishuddhi in the plan of Virata.

00:00:56.885 --> 00:01:02.790
Vishuddhi is such an important chakra;

00:01:04.202 --> 00:01:08.429
it has a very great manifestation also.

00:01:09.887 --> 00:01:18.723
For example it has another, you can say a subsidiary chakra,

00:01:20.168 --> 00:01:22.909
which we call as Hamsa Chakra.

00:01:26.401 --> 00:01:40.305
And the star which is increasing this center,

00:01:40.495 --> 00:01:47.635
we say the star that resides on
which this center is working, is Saturn.

00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:54.187
And as you know with Saturn there is
another small little Saturn moving.

00:01:54.687 --> 00:01:59.060
In the same way with this Vishuddhi Chakra,

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:06.130
there's another one which is a very important chakra,

00:02:07.024 --> 00:02:10.174
which we call as Hamsa Chakra.

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.896
We've had a puja of Hamsa Chakra in Germany once.

00:02:16.452 --> 00:02:23.165
And it has acted, I think, because Germans have realized

00:02:23.315 --> 00:02:32.896
that whatever they have done so far was absolutely inhuman.

00:02:33.968 --> 00:02:37.613
And I was so happy to see that when I went to Russia,

00:02:38.342 --> 00:02:45.062
the people who came to give them realization were mostly Germans.

00:02:48.155 --> 00:02:55.437
It really makes you feel so tender about the whole thing

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:02.028
that the Germans felt it is important, I mean,
they were the ones who were attracted

00:03:02.528 --> 00:03:07.188
to come to Russia to give realization to Russians;

00:03:07.236 --> 00:03:13.710
and you must know that the number of Russians killed

00:03:13.761 --> 00:03:19.066
are the maximum in the war, in this war, by Germans.

00:03:21.866 --> 00:03:26.979
So the discretion, the Divine Discretion,

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:36.094
that manifests through your Hamsa Chakra first started in Germany.

00:03:37.372 --> 00:03:46.729
And now you see how East Germany is entering into German territory,

00:03:47.243 --> 00:03:54.243
West Germany, and how they're welcoming them, looking after them.

00:03:56.473 --> 00:04:04.498
And who did was, all these things was,
few Sahaja Yogis who triggered it.

00:04:07.173 --> 00:04:12.488
So in those countries where there has been tremendous war

00:04:12.513 --> 00:04:16.146
problem, and they had czars and they had to go through hell -

00:04:16.171 --> 00:04:23.171
even Germans had to suffer a lot because of Hitler's misguidance.

00:04:23.941 --> 00:04:30.893
They have known hardships, they have known sacrifices,
they have known all kinds of ordeals they had to go through,

00:04:31.823 --> 00:04:38.823
but somehow this country has been blessed to such an extent

00:04:39.136 --> 00:04:47.600
that Americans never realized what is it that is hardship.

00:04:49.283 --> 00:04:55.041
And the blessings really have spoiled them.

00:04:56.259 --> 00:05:01.901
Hardships have been in all these countries
which we call as Eastern Bloc,

00:05:02.546 --> 00:05:07.948
and Sahaja Yoga is spreading like wildfire in all
these Eastern Bloc countries

00:05:08.226 --> 00:05:13.507
where they have been completely
under the rule of Russians, we can say,

00:05:13.913 --> 00:05:17.297
or under the rule of terror.

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:24.477
And the same terror has acted in Russia, throughout.

00:05:27.749 --> 00:05:34.296
In that terror, in that fear, it is surprising

00:05:34.924 --> 00:05:42.668
how this wisdom has grown in all
these people much more than in countries

00:05:42.776 --> 00:05:51.739
where we have the greatest affluence,  the greatest comfort of life.

00:05:56.143 --> 00:06:02.738
The hardship has taught them,
the fear has taught them, to be wise.

00:06:03.127 --> 00:06:07.290
And the best part is the discretion.

00:06:08.487 --> 00:06:16.219
Now this being Shri Krishna's country,
because He is Kubera, He's the God of wealth.

00:06:17.276 --> 00:06:20.459
The country is wealthy, no doubt;

00:06:21.523 --> 00:06:32.720
but the other part of Shri Krishna is completely missing,
is the Divine Discretion.

00:06:33.093 --> 00:06:40.751
How His Divine Discretion is shown,
even in Mahabharata, is wonderful to see.

00:06:42.798 --> 00:06:48.311
How He managed the Pandavas to win the war

00:06:48.399 --> 00:06:52.073
through His Divine Discretion because they were dharmic,

00:06:52.423 --> 00:06:55.381
they were standing in dharma.

00:06:55.497 --> 00:07:01.568
And how He supported the Pandavas because they were dharmic.

00:07:02.472 --> 00:07:05.980
But just the opposite is the situation of this America,

00:07:06.123 --> 00:07:09.991
that America always supports wrong people.

00:07:11.404 --> 00:07:19.200
And it has no principle of righteousness
or principle of its own freedom.

00:07:20.915 --> 00:07:28.415
For example, to support something like Argentina or Peru,

00:07:28.749 --> 00:07:31.790
where there's complete dictatorship.

00:07:32.037 --> 00:07:39.037
I've been there; I know what it is like in the time
it was under the regime of these people.

00:07:39.749 --> 00:07:46.489
And that's what has happened to the people of this country -
they have no Divine Discretion at all.

00:07:47.044 --> 00:07:51.658
And that's why I think all the false gurus have come and settled here,

00:07:51.683 --> 00:07:56.773
because they know these people have no Divine Discretion.

00:08:00.856 --> 00:08:04.965
The Hamsa Chakra is so weak here,

00:08:10.708 --> 00:08:15.842
that they cannot see what is dharma and what is adharma.

00:08:19.079 --> 00:08:24.400
Also, the basic principle by which this country

00:08:25.144 --> 00:08:31.330
became democratic was that this government is

00:08:31.743 --> 00:08:36.321
for the people, of the people, by the people.

00:08:39.681 --> 00:08:43.411
So it has to be people-oriented.

00:08:43.969 --> 00:08:48.595
But democracy at this stage without realization cannot work out.

00:08:48.842 --> 00:08:50.714
It's obvious.

00:08:52.122 --> 00:08:59.426
Few people who were cunning,
who could make money became money-oriented.

00:08:59.628 --> 00:09:07.220
They could advertise better;
they could manipulate better  than other people

00:09:07.545 --> 00:09:16.964
who were crooks also, making money like that,
through drugs, through other things, by other means.

00:09:18.319 --> 00:09:25.165
They could come up, they were elected, and they are in charge.

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:30.558
So it is not people-oriented,
but it is only money-oriented democracy.

00:09:31.151 --> 00:09:34.722
And maybe if it goes on like this, you'll find

00:09:35.254 --> 00:09:41.077
you might get some horrible crooks as rulers in this country.

00:09:42.922 --> 00:09:45.602
Because the one who can make money,

00:09:45.952 --> 00:09:52.263
the one who has lots of money,
by hook or crook, whosoever may be,

00:09:54.521 --> 00:09:59.970
can win over elections and can become our ruler here.

00:10:04.304 --> 00:10:11.304
So the democracy that was started or was spelled out by Abraham Lincoln

00:10:12.893 --> 00:10:16.849
is no more there; it's a money-oriented thing.

00:10:17.652 --> 00:10:22.254
And it has generated such a bad atmosphere all over the world

00:10:22.694 --> 00:10:29.694
that in the whole world now the conservatives,
the people who think they are conservatives,

00:10:30.218 --> 00:10:34.359
who are money-oriented people, who don't care for people at all,

00:10:36.074 --> 00:10:40.237
how are becoming the leaders, everywhere.

00:10:44.669 --> 00:10:58.281
So to be people-oriented one had to, first of all, understand

00:10:59.353 --> 00:11:03.760
that you have to have your realization,

00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:08.259
otherwise you do not become a collective being.

00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:11.694
If you do not become the collective being,

00:11:11.738 --> 00:11:21.240
you cannot enjoy the beautiful virtue of generosity.

00:11:22.927 --> 00:11:26.324
And when you do not have that generosity,

00:11:28.405 --> 00:11:36.342
then you become a person of a very small mind and a small heart.

00:11:39.117 --> 00:11:44.584
And the crookedness works everywhere.

00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:48.305
Outside they're very sweet to talk.

00:11:48.401 --> 00:11:53.345
But inside don't know what they will do,  how they'll deceive.

00:11:55.001 --> 00:11:58.060
In this kind of atmosphere we are.

00:11:58.590 --> 00:12:01.754
While you know in Russia we have done so well.

00:12:02.294 --> 00:12:07.114
In Russia people were just waiting for a Mother to come, that's all.

00:12:07.995 --> 00:12:10.638
They're Mother worshipers to begin with,

00:12:11.037 --> 00:12:14.323
and they were wanting somebody just to love them,

00:12:14.688 --> 00:12:19.986
every one of them, to tell them about love.

00:12:21.514 --> 00:12:25.024
Because they felt they were never loved by their mother.

00:12:25.055 --> 00:12:28.149
Here also, nobody's loved.

00:12:29.943 --> 00:12:34.285
But the pattern of the government there

00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:39.364
and the pattern of the people are two different types.

00:12:39.531 --> 00:12:44.924
The government people are very, you can call them very dominating,

00:12:45.059 --> 00:12:49.294
extremely strict and exploiting type.

00:12:49.493 --> 00:12:52.917
But the people are the exploited ones.

00:12:53.187 --> 00:12:58.620
But here, the pattern of the government is taken over by people.

00:13:01.828 --> 00:13:06.560
As the government is exploiting people,
people are also exploiting each other.

00:13:06.735 --> 00:13:11.056
As much as they can exploit, very good.
After all money is the end of it.

00:13:13.628 --> 00:13:19.860
That's why I used to think why in America Sahaja Yoga is failing.

00:13:20.362 --> 00:13:22.382
All kinds of thugs have come here.

00:13:22.407 --> 00:13:26.621
They have made lots of money, they have ...
I mean they all are thrown out and

00:13:26.646 --> 00:13:29.132
so many had to be thrown out, it's all right.

00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:33.878
But as far as Sahaja Yoga message is concerned, people cannot absorb it.

00:13:37.323 --> 00:13:40.797
So now for Sahaja Yogis it is very important

00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:46.450
to become really very deep Sahaja Yogis -

00:13:46.816 --> 00:13:53.026
very, very deep - so that we can trigger better.

00:13:54.594 --> 00:14:00.839
Even if there are two Sahaja Yogis
who are very deep, one can trigger a lot.

00:14:03.317 --> 00:14:06.647
Like you'll be surprised in Hungary
people were saying in the beginning,

00:14:06.672 --> 00:14:08.656
"Mother, what about Hungary? It should become free."

00:14:08.681 --> 00:14:12.025
I said, "Let there be one Sahaja Yogi to come in."

00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:20.374
Only one fellow came in - absolutely sick,
very thin and worn-out fellow.

00:14:20.773 --> 00:14:24.117
I treated him. I cured him.

00:14:24.483 --> 00:14:27.799
And with love, he got nourishment.

00:14:29.347 --> 00:14:32.918
And within eight days after his realization,

00:14:33.462 --> 00:14:41.769
he went back, and after a week, Hungary got its freedom.

00:14:42.835 --> 00:14:46.468
Though we are few in here,

00:14:46.619 --> 00:14:50.821
we all have to be very conscious of it -

00:14:50.989 --> 00:14:58.245
that we are the foundation, and if we fail, we'll fail our country.

00:14:59.324 --> 00:15:07.717
And we have to be very deep, sensible Sahaja Yogis.

00:15:08.939 --> 00:15:11.757
So what problems do we face here?

00:15:12.416 --> 00:15:20.387
First as I've told hundred times that you have to open your heart.

00:15:22.617 --> 00:15:28.987
That's such an important thing for all Sahaja Yogis to open their heart.

00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:35.422
Look into your hearts. What do you want?

00:15:38.861 --> 00:15:45.884
Not through rationality, but through vibrations.

00:15:46.336 --> 00:15:48.716
What do you want?

00:15:49.035 --> 00:15:52.060
You ask yourself, "What do I want?"

00:15:52.428 --> 00:15:55.349
Then say few words, "I want money."

00:15:55.513 --> 00:15:57.500
Vibrations won't flow.

00:15:58.071 --> 00:16:02.230
"I want this, that." Vibrations won't flow.

00:16:02.909 --> 00:16:04.781
Then what do you want?

00:16:05.536 --> 00:16:09.535
" I want to be a deep Sahaja Yogi, very deep.

00:16:09.758 --> 00:16:13.222
So I could save my country."

00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:16.979
If Americans will go to hell,

00:16:17.095 --> 00:16:21.432
you will be held responsible for that, nobody else.

00:16:23.417 --> 00:16:27.882
You need very few people to trigger it, I tell you.

00:16:29.125 --> 00:16:33.303
But we still stick on to our past.

00:16:34.556 --> 00:16:40.015
Problems and problems of America are
very different type all the time.

00:16:40.525 --> 00:16:42.725
First is aggressiveness.

00:16:45.985 --> 00:16:49.322
What is in aggressiveness?

00:16:50.847 --> 00:16:56.537
Loving someone, being kind to someone,

00:16:57.606 --> 00:17:03.507
should be so natural because that is what your Spirit is.

00:17:03.721 --> 00:17:09.660
It loves. It enjoys the love, giving love.

00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:22.004
So to allow your Spirit to manifest,
you have to understand Its nature.

00:17:22.775 --> 00:17:30.959
Spirit can never be aggressive, can never dominate.

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:38.669
It respects the freedom of another person
because It's a free being.

00:17:41.476 --> 00:17:45.959
So this aggressiveness that we have within us,

00:17:46.047 --> 00:17:48.606
we have to really challenge it

00:17:48.764 --> 00:17:52.256
and ask, "Why are we aggressive?"

00:17:55.342 --> 00:18:03.485
But the understanding about oneself has to be very honest also.

00:18:03.636 --> 00:18:15.480
Because if you want to justify,
and if you want to close your eyes to reality,

00:18:16.606 --> 00:18:21.087
then you cannot improve yourself.

00:18:21.589 --> 00:18:28.589
And when the depth grows inside then it is tremendous, I tell you,

00:18:29.234 --> 00:18:31.850
because this Power which is surrounding us -

00:18:31.875 --> 00:18:34.874
which you know about, which you have felt it -

00:18:35.255 --> 00:18:42.154
has to flow through a medium which is absolutely clean,

00:18:43.102 --> 00:18:46.377
egoless, conditionless.

00:18:46.538 --> 00:18:49.609
But we are so much conditioned,

00:18:50.079 --> 00:18:53.069
and in this so-called free country,

00:18:53.339 --> 00:18:56.885
this freedom has conditioned us.
It's like a person who is let loose,

00:18:56.910 --> 00:18:58.724
doesn't know where to go.

00:18:58.766 --> 00:19:03.567
He bangs his head this side, bangs his head that side,

00:19:04.414 --> 00:19:08.210
And the problems are so funny -

00:19:09.514 --> 00:19:17.872
problems which do not exist anywhere (else), exist in this country.

00:19:18.795 --> 00:19:21.358
You know them very well.

00:19:21.406 --> 00:19:31.963
It's such shocking state that when we think about it,

00:19:32.019 --> 00:19:35.757
what's going to happen? Where are we going to be?

00:19:36.381 --> 00:19:41.605
So we are really on a warpath in America,
I must tell you, for Sahaja Yogis,

00:19:42.161 --> 00:19:49.161
really on a warpath. Unless and until you take up Sahaja Yoga as

00:19:50.008 --> 00:19:56.054
your only concern, it's not going to work out.

00:19:57.252 --> 00:20:03.206
We have problems like somebody has no job,
then somebody has this [here], he's lost something here,

00:20:03.284 --> 00:20:06.837
then husband's, wife's problems
and all these nonsensical things.

00:20:09.849 --> 00:20:12.161
Still people are struggling with that.

00:20:12.384 --> 00:20:16.918
How many times you've been married in previous lives?

00:20:17.218 --> 00:20:20.766
Then somebody's wife is dominating, somebody's husband is dominating.

00:20:20.791 --> 00:20:26.449
Such absurd things! Doesn't behoove saints.

00:20:27.791 --> 00:20:42.453
So the quality of Sahaja Yogis in America,
unless and until is raised, one cannot trigger anything here.

00:20:43.691 --> 00:20:50.613
And the first thing that the Sahaja Yogis
must have is collectivity in America,

00:20:50.708 --> 00:20:55.459
because America stands for Vishuddhi Chakra,

00:20:55.555 --> 00:21:01.083
which is manifesting collectivity within us.

00:21:01.472 --> 00:21:04.423
And if people cannot be collective,

00:21:05.955 --> 00:21:12.919
then how can you have Sahaja Yoga manifesting here? Impossible.

00:21:13.514 --> 00:21:17.510
Because that is the greatest quality you have.

00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:22.940
That's the basic power you have in this country
is the collectivity within you.

00:21:23.163 --> 00:21:26.732
So you have two basic powers. First is collectivity

00:21:26.931 --> 00:21:31.581
and the second one that you have is the Divine Discretion.

00:21:31.851 --> 00:21:36.256
Basically given to you these powers,

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:39.042
and just the opposite if we go.

00:21:39.436 --> 00:21:43.138
I've heard about many Sahaja Yogis

00:21:43.163 --> 00:21:49.945
who avoid company of children, who run away from other people.

00:21:50.072 --> 00:21:53.165
If they see three, four people sitting there,

00:21:53.301 --> 00:21:57.038
then they can't share the room with them.

00:21:58.459 --> 00:22:00.070
It's very common.

00:22:04.964 --> 00:22:08.046
Say now, supposing there's a very small little room,

00:22:09.808 --> 00:22:12.774
and so many have to sleep in a small little room,

00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:17.783
it's nice in a way. It's an experience.

00:22:18.141 --> 00:22:21.793
Then, where do you sleep?
You sleep there, you sleep there?

00:22:21.818 --> 00:22:25.745
How do you manage?
You can't go to the bathroom. And it's an event.

00:22:35.005 --> 00:22:39.159
The life which is smooth is boring.

00:22:46.252 --> 00:22:50.502
There should be some events in life, you see, like this.

00:22:51.011 --> 00:22:53.272
But Americans always avoid

00:22:53.297 --> 00:23:01.601
any, any such thing which requires an eventful time.

00:23:03.707 --> 00:23:07.148
Otherwise, if you walk straight forward,

00:23:07.181 --> 00:23:11.554
you see, reach some place,
open the door and everything is ready made.

00:23:11.579 --> 00:23:14.806
You walk into a room, everything electrified

00:23:14.885 --> 00:23:17.158
and you just get your seat. You sit on the seat.

00:23:17.183 --> 00:23:19.840
If you have to get up, the seat puts you out.

00:23:22.192 --> 00:23:25.640
Or, I went to somebody's house and they said, "We have a bed here."

00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:27.090
I said, "What's so special?"

00:23:27.090 --> 00:23:30.028
He said, "If you press this button, your legs will come up.

00:23:30.037 --> 00:23:33.718
If you press this button,
you head will come up.

00:23:34.127 --> 00:23:35.685
You'll turn round."

00:23:35.710 --> 00:23:39.140
I said, "I can do all that Myself.

00:23:45.473 --> 00:23:50.345
I'm not that old or that weak that I can't do it."

00:23:51.965 --> 00:23:58.653
But, you see they,  the way people are, always looking for comfort,

00:23:59.018 --> 00:24:04.238
always looking for comfort, and like to have smooth life.

00:24:04.817 --> 00:24:08.370
And the smoothness has made them so boring.

00:24:08.401 --> 00:24:10.458
I mean their life is really boring.

00:24:10.483 --> 00:24:17.608
And a person who has a boring life cannot have a vision.

00:24:19.191 --> 00:24:21.237
Cannot. Everything is done up now.

00:24:21.262 --> 00:24:25.189
You go there, everything is first class.
There's nothing to worry.

00:24:25.216 --> 00:24:29.980
There's a ... you go to a hotel,
everything is paid for, nicely kept.

00:24:30.012 --> 00:24:32.544
It's a very good hotel.

00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:37.273
But only when in a hotel you are staying and suddenly you,

00:24:37.361 --> 00:24:40.221
people tell you, "Oh there's going to be an earthquake!"

00:24:40.246 --> 00:24:45.774
You run out with your pajamas
and you find yourself in funny companies.

00:24:45.870 --> 00:24:48.495
And that's what you remember.

00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:52.402
You may go to various places

00:24:52.418 --> 00:24:55.385
and live in various comforts and things.

00:24:55.410 --> 00:24:57.273
You don't remember that.

00:24:59.519 --> 00:25:03.890
So people now want to do something funny.

00:25:03.914 --> 00:25:07.573
Like they'll do trekking up, they're doing this, and

00:25:07.598 --> 00:25:10.270
all those funny sort of thing.

00:25:11.985 --> 00:25:14.907
Because the life is not eventful,

00:25:15.490 --> 00:25:21.063
they are trying something that is dangerous, that is destroying.

00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:26.753
But supposing if you had accepted events in life as important.

00:25:27.904 --> 00:25:31.127
What does it matter? Let's see what happens.

00:25:32.531 --> 00:25:37.425
For example, if I say, "Now, some people have to go from here

00:25:38.124 --> 00:25:40.020
to Phoenix and settle down there."

00:25:40.173 --> 00:25:42.510
Immediately, "How will they go?"

00:25:42.598 --> 00:25:46.824
And, "Where will be the house? Where will they stay?

00:25:46.849 --> 00:25:52.720
Who will pay for it?" And every question,
such a big question they have.

00:25:54.242 --> 00:25:56.104
"Yes, we'll go. What's the harm?

00:25:56.144 --> 00:25:59.639
We'll stay anywhere, under a tree. Doesn't matter. What's that?"

00:25:59.679 --> 00:26:04.835
After all monkeys can live there, why can't we?
They were our forefathers.

00:26:06.886 --> 00:26:13.886
But that sort of a comfort loving temperament is very dangerous.

00:26:14.233 --> 00:26:17.326
And they feel they are very tired, all the time.

00:26:17.326 --> 00:26:21.520
You see in American films nowadays what I see is anybody,

00:26:21.655 --> 00:26:25.729
even a heroine or a hero, comes and says, "Ahhh."

00:26:26.753 --> 00:26:30.028
Perhaps they think too much they are working hard

00:26:30.203 --> 00:26:33.059
or they are doing this.  All the time they think.

00:26:34.861 --> 00:26:36.976
There's a Sahaja Yogini in London.

00:26:37.001 --> 00:26:41.895
She's an Indian girl, works very hard,
does every stitching, everything she does.

00:26:41.974 --> 00:26:43.285
She's very happy.

00:26:43.365 --> 00:26:47.991
There's another one who is an English one,
he's always tired.

00:26:48.872 --> 00:26:52.681
So I told her, "Why is he tired?
He looks so healthy. Why is he so tired?"

00:26:52.745 --> 00:26:55.636
She said, "Mother, You know he thinks he's working.

00:26:55.653 --> 00:26:59.675
I don't think, I think it's Mother Who is working

00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:02.689
because I leave everything at Your Lotus Feet.

00:27:03.390 --> 00:27:07.048
I am not working. She's working.

00:27:07.223 --> 00:27:09.481
I'm leaving at Her Lotus Feet, that's all."

00:27:09.513 --> 00:27:11.783
And then you don't feel that.

00:27:11.878 --> 00:27:15.679
Now the quarrel between husband and wife here is mainly,

00:27:15.785 --> 00:27:19.423
"how many dishes you have washed,
how many dishes I have washed."

00:27:21.687 --> 00:27:26.301
"How much physical work you have done,
how much physical work I have done."

00:27:26.745 --> 00:27:33.513
It's a kind of a competition going on as to all the time weigh

00:27:33.736 --> 00:27:35.900
"what you have done, what I have done."

00:27:36.011 --> 00:27:41.931
But supposing if you want to do something in such a manner that,

00:27:41.956 --> 00:27:46.855
"Let me see, I will surprise my husband by doing everything nicely.

00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:48.470
Let's finish it wast"

00:27:49.161 --> 00:27:52.228
You'll do it very well, and you'll never be tired.

00:27:52.315 --> 00:27:56.344
And when you'll see your husband coming home
and seeing things done so well,

00:27:56.369 --> 00:28:00.249
so well, so happy.

00:28:00.408 --> 00:28:05.510
That joy of doing something to make someone happy

00:28:05.709 --> 00:28:13.056
will completely neutralize all your discomfort,
or the fatigue that you have.

00:28:14.247 --> 00:28:17.552
The other way round, also. The husband should also feel that

00:28:17.592 --> 00:28:22.026
"what could I do for her?"
A small little thing can make her happy.

00:28:23.171 --> 00:28:27.010
And the divorces here are all the time because

00:28:27.153 --> 00:28:33.382
of this kind of a nonsensical idea that

00:28:33.707 --> 00:28:38.014
"how much he has done, what I have done, what he has done."

00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:46.693
All the time weighing it out and making yourself miserable.

00:28:51.606 --> 00:28:54.859
I travel a lot as you know.

00:28:54.884 --> 00:29:00.161
I never feel I'm traveling, because I am there with Myself,

00:29:00.546 --> 00:29:03.998
whether I sit here or travel it's just the same.

00:29:04.054 --> 00:29:08.662
But if you think,  "I'm traveling",
then you feel,  "Oh God, I'm traveling!"

00:29:09.328 --> 00:29:11.976
But if you just think, "I'm sitting here in the chair;

00:29:12.001 --> 00:29:15.263
I'm sitting there in the chair", you don't feel tired.

00:29:15.914 --> 00:29:18.034
If you are doing some work,

00:29:18.034 --> 00:29:22.521
you feel tired when you start thinking,
"I am doing this work, I have done that work."

00:29:22.743 --> 00:29:27.486
Especially in Sahaja Yoga, if you think,
"I am doing any work" better not do it.

00:29:28.772 --> 00:29:33.046
But if you think, "I am doing nothing" and what joy -

00:29:36.058 --> 00:29:40.280
what joy it is! You'll become so energetic,

00:29:40.428 --> 00:29:47.290
because once you surrender,
then the Divine Power starts flowing through Me.

00:29:47.315 --> 00:29:51.043
That's why Mohammed Sahib has said,
"Islam means to surrender."

00:29:51.615 --> 00:29:54.454
He said it about Me also, that "I'll send you",

00:29:54.479 --> 00:29:56.136
He called Me the "Sent One."

00:29:56.779 --> 00:30:03.990
Everything He's talked about,
having vibrations and all that, in His own style,

00:30:04.125 --> 00:30:08.800
but He said that the message would be of surrender.

00:30:09.419 --> 00:30:11.962
And that surrendering part has to be there

00:30:11.987 --> 00:30:15.410
because Shri Krishna in Gita has very clearly said that,

00:30:15.435 --> 00:30:19.242
"Forget every dharma, just surrender yourself to Me."

00:30:21.718 --> 00:30:26.333
And that surrendering, if the Sahaja Yogis develop

00:30:27.206 --> 00:30:31.750
in America, the rest I'll look after.
But you leave it to Me to do it.

00:30:35.522 --> 00:30:38.929
And then ideas and everything will start flowing because

00:30:38.977 --> 00:30:43.564
this is Virata's place.
That's why you have such great scientists here,

00:30:43.731 --> 00:30:47.656
such great schools for all kinds of intellectual work

00:30:47.681 --> 00:30:51.266
and all that is here, while people are not wise.

00:30:51.497 --> 00:30:55.534
They are not wise at all. I've known people who-

00:30:55.632 --> 00:31:00.788
there's a, I met a president of Union Society,
he was eighty years of age,

00:31:00.939 --> 00:31:05.247
and he's supposed to be the President of the whole world.

00:31:07.511 --> 00:31:10.170
And he said, "I must see You privately."

00:31:10.195 --> 00:31:14.701
I said, "All right." He came to Me and

00:31:15.268 --> 00:31:20.958
his problem was so stupid that I just started looking at him.

00:31:20.983 --> 00:31:23.736
Eighty year old man, this stupid fellow!

00:31:24.409 --> 00:31:28.427
He's not even like a ten-year-old boy.

00:31:28.625 --> 00:31:34.350
No maturity of any kind. So immature.

00:31:34.896 --> 00:31:39.335
And when I saw him, I just had the glimpse of the whole thing,

00:31:39.462 --> 00:31:44.403
that "look at this man, eighty year old,
he's the Chairman of Union Society,

00:31:44.569 --> 00:31:48.774
he's - all over the world, people think
he's the Chairman of this thing."

00:31:48.799 --> 00:31:51.556
The chair may be better than him.

00:31:52.953 --> 00:31:56.130
Such a stupid fellow in a way.

00:31:56.378 --> 00:31:59.814
Such a stupid fellow that you can't imagine.

00:32:00.265 --> 00:32:02.209
So they might be intelligent,

00:32:02.225 --> 00:32:07.229
they might be well read,
they might be able to discover something out of matter,

00:32:07.781 --> 00:32:10.256
but they do not have wisdom.

00:32:10.542 --> 00:32:16.520
And the wisdom can only come through honest introspection.

00:32:18.083 --> 00:32:23.488
But it should not be also, "I'm catching on this chakra,
I'm catching on that chakra." Not that.

00:32:23.655 --> 00:32:29.258
But, "Why am I not seeing the point? What's the matter with me?

00:32:30.830 --> 00:32:33.923
Why can't I understand what is Sahaja Yoga?"

00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:39.484
Even when you have become Sahaja Yogis now for years together,

00:32:39.556 --> 00:32:42.856
still these old nonsensical things stick on to you,

00:32:42.881 --> 00:32:47.454
these ideas stick on to you. Why?

00:32:48.206 --> 00:32:55.180
Why do we not have that purity of Divine

00:32:55.205 --> 00:33:00.350
Discretion, which sees everything so clearly?

00:33:01.954 --> 00:33:07.286
So I think we need collectivity first of all,

00:33:08.017 --> 00:33:12.294
and secondly meditative honesty.

00:33:12.728 --> 00:33:16.747
Just to meditate, sit down before the photograph,
do the meditation - no!

00:33:17.221 --> 00:33:23.580
Meditation should act, should work.

00:33:24.053 --> 00:33:26.672
If it does not work, something wrong with you.

00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:28.299
Absolutely something wrong.

00:33:29.612 --> 00:33:34.758
If you feel everything is working all right,

00:33:35.353 --> 00:33:45.104
everything is miraculously showing its presence,

00:33:45.636 --> 00:33:49.121
presence of the Paramachaitanya, then you are all right.

00:33:49.146 --> 00:33:52.085
But if it is not so, if there are problems,

00:33:52.291 --> 00:33:56.002
then you're not, you're not a Sahaja Yogi.

00:33:57.216 --> 00:34:05.781
Sahaja Yogi is the one who is completely
connected with this Paramachaitanya.

00:34:08.777 --> 00:34:10.980
And for that age is no bar.

00:34:11.005 --> 00:34:17.008
I have seen girls who are only sixteen, seventeen, eighteen years so wise.

00:34:18.383 --> 00:34:25.668
Even small little children who were with Guido, I talked to them.

00:34:26.184 --> 00:34:28.998
I was surprised at their wisdom.

00:34:29.165 --> 00:34:34.103
So very wise, so beautiful.

00:34:36.215 --> 00:34:38.311
They understood human nature so well.

00:34:38.344 --> 00:34:45.807
Small little children about, they were at the most, ten years of age.

00:34:46.632 --> 00:34:49.339
And nice to talk to them.

00:34:51.393 --> 00:34:54.371
So that wisdom if they can have at that age,

00:34:54.396 --> 00:35:00.320
now we are also, all of us are about ten years old
Sahaja Yogis, minimum, nothing else.

00:35:02.069 --> 00:35:11.564
But still we are struggling, ambitious and wrong priorities.

00:35:12.725 --> 00:35:15.454
There is no need to have any ambition.

00:35:15.479 --> 00:35:20.052
Ambition is an imaginary thing.

00:35:20.290 --> 00:35:23.012
But Sahaja Yoga is reality.

00:35:23.566 --> 00:35:26.438
Everything works out.

00:35:26.890 --> 00:35:30.000
Everything sorts itself.

00:35:30.135 --> 00:35:32.539
Everything plans out.

00:35:32.564 --> 00:35:36.666
But to feel that if this is so,

00:35:36.968 --> 00:35:39.928
as I said in a small room  there are twelve people,

00:35:40.158 --> 00:35:44.665
it's something for the good. Why not?

00:35:46.966 --> 00:35:52.152
We have to be there. If I've lost the way, supposing,

00:35:54.879 --> 00:35:56.930
then I would say I have to go this way.

00:35:57.111 --> 00:36:01.300
This time we made a ticket which was
little wrong according to everyone

00:36:01.325 --> 00:36:03.593
because we had to go through Phoenix.

00:36:03.695 --> 00:36:08.885
But nice because I felt the vibrations of Phoenix,
I had to go that way.

00:36:09.671 --> 00:36:11.904
I had to see that.

00:36:14.066 --> 00:36:18.124
So always to find something smooth,

00:36:18.379 --> 00:36:23.906
the way we want it to be smooth, is not the way of Sahaja Yoga.

00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:32.181
Whatever we get it, we see the hand of the Divine behind it.

00:36:32.946 --> 00:36:35.658
What is our purpose of life?

00:36:36.062 --> 00:36:44.496
Our purpose of life is to save people,
save the Americans, minimum of minimums.

00:36:44.496 --> 00:36:47.452
Not the world, but at least start with Americans.

00:36:47.477 --> 00:36:51.592
That's our purpose of life. That's our identity.

00:36:51.805 --> 00:36:58.805
While doing that, there is Paramachaitanya
which is going to look after you completely.

00:36:59.465 --> 00:37:03.909
But first you put yourself before everything else,

00:37:03.957 --> 00:37:09.289
"I must have this, I must have that, I must have this."
It won't work out.

00:37:10.990 --> 00:37:14.849
Then, "I have this problem, I jumped into bankruptcy,

00:37:14.858 --> 00:37:18.167
I had that problem, I just couldn't manage."

00:37:18.192 --> 00:37:25.192
Because you have put other things before your "self". "

00:37:26.025 --> 00:37:28.247
Self" means the Spirit.

00:37:28.670 --> 00:37:32.771
According to people, "self" means selfishness,

00:37:32.906 --> 00:37:36.398
but according to Sahaja Yoga, "self" means your Spirit.

00:37:37.748 --> 00:37:43.858
So today's lecture should not be that
we hear from one ear and goes through the same one,

00:37:43.961 --> 00:37:49.113
but should we little bit ponder about it
and listen to it again and again.

00:37:50.168 --> 00:37:55.398
I have great hopes for you.
I have worked very hard in America, very much.

00:37:56.104 --> 00:37:58.310
But it has never been

00:37:59.031 --> 00:38:02.643
that state where I could say,"Now I can trigger something.

00:38:04.958 --> 00:38:08.710
" Even if there are few Sahaja Yogis
who are very deep and good,

00:38:08.735 --> 00:38:14.138
they are pulled down by others -
by jealousies, by this, by that.

00:38:17.364 --> 00:38:20.405
It's not the number that you are  but

00:38:21.039 --> 00:38:24.510
the quality that you are, first of all.

00:38:26.260 --> 00:38:29.545
But in Russia, I found it so easy, so very easy.

00:38:30.300 --> 00:38:34.031
It was wonderful, unbelievable.

00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:37.546
I've been only there thrice, can you imagine?

00:38:37.761 --> 00:38:40.660
And now Sahaja Yoga is a religion throughout.

00:38:40.676 --> 00:38:44.064
Everyone knows Me in Russia.

00:38:47.437 --> 00:38:53.841
But here people only know Rajneesh
or that Muktananda, all horrible people.

00:38:57.045 --> 00:39:02.096
Now, you can also say that,
"Mother, it's a question of advertising."

00:39:02.498 --> 00:39:06.284
That here the people, the way they advertise
and manipulate, and all that.

00:39:06.467 --> 00:39:14.064
But it only works out in places
where people are not seeking reality.

00:39:16.190 --> 00:39:19.365
Why can't they see that this is all publicity?

00:39:20.081 --> 00:39:21.921
They have no discretion?

00:39:22.438 --> 00:39:25.183
Supposing tomorrow they say, "This is the hair style." Then all

00:39:25.208 --> 00:39:27.519
Americans are in the same hair style.

00:39:27.544 --> 00:39:29.965
You can't make them out who is who.

00:39:30.307 --> 00:39:33.382
Or they say "this is the way the dress has to be."

00:39:33.517 --> 00:39:36.080
All Americans will be dressed up that way.

00:39:36.266 --> 00:39:37.852
I mean it's a slavery.

00:39:38.130 --> 00:39:41.206
Today's entrepreneurs, and through all this advertisement,

00:39:41.309 --> 00:39:43.577
any kind of advertisement.

00:39:43.711 --> 00:39:46.869
If that enamors people so much,

00:39:47.013 --> 00:39:49.753
that means we are fools, we are stupid,

00:39:49.902 --> 00:39:54.142
we are idiots that we cannot think for ourselves.

00:39:54.276 --> 00:39:56.236
Anybody can befool us.

00:39:56.356 --> 00:39:59.332
Anybody can put up anything in the market.

00:39:59.419 --> 00:40:01.927
Anything they talk about, we'll jump at it

00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:06.246
as if we have no brains to understand, to take to it.

00:40:08.381 --> 00:40:11.470
It's like we have no roots.

00:40:12.121 --> 00:40:17.451
We are just like some weeds which are thrown from this end to that end.

00:40:18.833 --> 00:40:24.198
But in Sahaja Yoga, your roots must grow much, much faster than anybody else,

00:40:24.618 --> 00:40:28.997
because this is the land of Shri Krishna.

00:40:31.315 --> 00:40:36.202
How many things He has done in His lifetime we have to see.

00:40:37.399 --> 00:40:44.399
As a child He killed so many demons,
while all demons are invited here.

00:40:45.649 --> 00:40:52.105
As a child He raised the Kundalini of all the Gopis and everyone.

00:40:53.934 --> 00:41:00.478
He played all kinds of beautiful tricks to amuse people as a child.

00:41:02.827 --> 00:41:08.122
And later on, He killed His own uncle.

00:41:10.704 --> 00:41:18.555
Which shows one thing -
an uncle in Indian families is the nearest person.

00:41:18.783 --> 00:41:21.570
In the marriage, it is the uncle who gives the daughter,

00:41:21.595 --> 00:41:26.579
it is the uncle who performs most of the rituals and everything.

00:41:26.604 --> 00:41:29.681
The uncle is the nearest person.

00:41:30.372 --> 00:41:34.240
And He killed His own uncle.

00:41:35.506 --> 00:41:43.105
Shows that He finished off all these artificial relationships.

00:41:46.851 --> 00:41:52.668
And then we find in America there are people

00:41:52.780 --> 00:41:55.533
who have done this kind of thing is to

00:41:55.597 --> 00:42:00.269
have nothing to do with the mother,
have nothing to do with father, have nothing to do with

00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:06.123
sister or wife, husband, children, anyone.

00:42:09.330 --> 00:42:13.345
But for what? For what have they given up?

00:42:14.345 --> 00:42:18.292
They gave it up for selfishness. For money.

00:42:18.595 --> 00:42:21.491
Not for something higher.

00:42:22.023 --> 00:42:27.830
Just the opposite of what
Shri Krishna did is to kill His own uncle because,

00:42:29.171 --> 00:42:35.663
to deliver His parents from their prison and also to kill a demon.

00:42:36.148 --> 00:42:37.985
He was a demon.

00:42:41.252 --> 00:42:44.235
So in our own understanding,

00:42:44.759 --> 00:42:53.874
if we understand one thing: that we are living on the soil,

00:42:54.192 --> 00:43:01.387
or on the soil of that country which is blessed by Shri Krishna,

00:43:04.847 --> 00:43:08.386
Who is called as Yogeshwara.

00:43:11.177 --> 00:43:19.036
So the first part was that when He destroyed all these things,

00:43:19.862 --> 00:43:22.475
he was a Yogeshwara.

00:43:23.860 --> 00:43:30.860
He was the Divine Energy for yoga,

00:43:31.932 --> 00:43:36.471
for union with the Divine Power.

00:43:37.873 --> 00:43:42.368
He was the Ishwara. He is the Deity.

00:43:43.186 --> 00:43:48.081
If He was a Deity and He's the One Who is the ruler of this area,

00:43:48.194 --> 00:43:51.384
then what should we be?

00:43:51.955 --> 00:43:54.641
In yoga, we should be masters.

00:43:56.015 --> 00:43:59.784
Not mentally

00:44:01.715 --> 00:44:05.890
but at that state, of the higher state.

00:44:07.707 --> 00:44:09.816
If that could be achieved,

00:44:12.983 --> 00:44:18.209
then you people should become the highest of highest yogis.

00:44:18.360 --> 00:44:24.240
Because you have that power existing in this place. It is there.

00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:29.207
So many have told Me that, "Mother, now don't You worry about,

00:44:31.279 --> 00:44:34.724
don't You worry about America. Just forget it.

00:44:34.749 --> 00:44:37.744
Why to waste time in America?

00:44:38.858 --> 00:44:42.474
It's not going to work out. It's useless."

00:44:42.648 --> 00:44:48.195
But I know such a lot of power exists
in this country of the Yogeshwara,

00:44:49.292 --> 00:44:53.248
and if you can use that power of Yogeshwara,

00:44:53.979 --> 00:45:01.201
you can do so much good to the whole humanity at this juncture

00:45:01.694 --> 00:45:05.388
when the history is taking another fall.

00:45:07.023 --> 00:45:11.021
Now those who rise in spirituality -

00:45:11.053 --> 00:45:14.552
everybody is now today talking of spirituality,

00:45:16.009 --> 00:45:19.314
even Prince of Wales the other day was talking

00:45:19.339 --> 00:45:22.595
that "We should take to spirituality not to so much materialism

00:45:22.614 --> 00:45:26.812
that has caused us ecological problems and things like that."

00:45:26.995 --> 00:45:29.406
Everybody's talking of spirituality,

00:45:29.430 --> 00:45:32.430
and you are the ones who have it with you.

00:45:33.009 --> 00:45:35.395
You are the ones who have powers with you.

00:45:35.705 --> 00:45:37.840
You are the ones who can spread it.

00:45:37.865 --> 00:45:41.497
And once you start spreading it,

00:45:41.569 --> 00:45:46.859
you'll be surprised how you will achieve

00:45:47.425 --> 00:45:54.638
tremendous heights in every sphere, in every walk of life.

00:45:55.643 --> 00:45:59.396
So your identity is that you are Sahaja Yogis

00:45:59.730 --> 00:46:04.079
and you have to use the power of Yogeshwara,

00:46:04.406 --> 00:46:08.663
Who is the presiding Deity of this country.

00:46:10.858 --> 00:46:14.191
I bless you all that you have that wisdom,

00:46:14.216 --> 00:46:16.183
that depth, to touch your depth.

00:46:16.192 --> 00:46:25.181
Somehow try to work it out, stop all nonsensical fights and things.

00:46:25.206 --> 00:46:29.784
Become collective. Try to understand each other.

00:46:30.157 --> 00:46:32.449
Try to open your hearts.

00:46:32.474 --> 00:46:35.806
You have such depth. You are born in this country

00:46:35.912 --> 00:46:39.193
because the Yogeshwara wanted you to be here

00:46:39.273 --> 00:46:43.677
and He has blessed you with all the bounties of His love.

00:46:45.752 --> 00:46:50.970
Now it is for you to use that tremendous power:

00:46:52.093 --> 00:46:55.007
but without love, we can.

00:46:55.111 --> 00:47:02.694
Because he was the embodiment of madhurya, sweetness,

00:47:05.871 --> 00:47:06.871
sweetness.

00:47:07.528 --> 00:47:15.627
That madhurya you have to imbibe,
and that madhurya you have to spread.

00:47:18.632 --> 00:47:20.771
That's very important.

00:47:22.009 --> 00:47:27.024
So, that relationship of sweetness between each other,

00:47:27.565 --> 00:47:31.556
the relation of enjoying each other,

00:47:32.255 --> 00:47:37.913
the relation of knowing each other,

00:47:38.972 --> 00:47:47.262
has to be full of sweetness, just like honey.

00:47:50.991 --> 00:47:59.333
It is just there, but we have to be the bee to reach there.

00:47:59.881 --> 00:48:02.555
And I am sure it will work out.

00:48:04.029 --> 00:48:07.016
It should work out for all of you.

00:48:07.993 --> 00:48:12.544
So those who run away from collectivity should be very careful.

00:48:12.608 --> 00:48:14.407
They are not Sahaja Yogis

00:48:14.424 --> 00:48:18.431
and if they continue like this, they'll be just thrown out.

00:48:18.685 --> 00:48:21.348
They will be nowhere in Sahaja Yoga, I tell you.

00:48:22.041 --> 00:48:30.350
So you have to, first of all, understand that to be in Sahaja Yoga

00:48:31.767 --> 00:48:39.096
is only possible if we are having that depth,

00:48:39.201 --> 00:48:44.747
because a new jump is needed in Sahaja Yoga which will work out,

00:48:44.795 --> 00:48:48.956
which is working out and many will be thrown out.

00:48:50.408 --> 00:48:55.426
You have to jump, and for that jumping you really need people

00:48:55.459 --> 00:49:02.836
who are honest and deep and serious.

00:49:03.789 --> 00:49:09.200
Don't get lost onto frivolous things and worldly things.

00:49:09.295 --> 00:49:14.665
Just seek your depth. It's all there, so beautiful.

00:49:16.372 --> 00:49:19.232
So, may God bless you!
