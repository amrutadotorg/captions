worked out in a very wonderful way this time.

01:24:37.440 --> 01:24:39.360
Because they invited Me -

01:24:39.680 --> 01:24:42.960

Yogi: [FRENCH]

01:25:07.520 --> 01:25:09.760
And the Nandgaon was

01:25:09.880 --> 01:25:13.320
used by Shivaji's Mother's side

01:25:13.560 --> 01:25:15.560
because they were hounded by

01:25:15.760 --> 01:25:18.040
the eh.. by Aurangzeb.

01:25:34.960 --> 01:25:36.400
They are called as Jadhavas.

01:25:36.760 --> 01:25:37.760
Jadhavs.

01:25:40.320 --> 01:25:43.280
The word comes from Yadav which was Krishna's vansh.

01:25:46.920 --> 01:25:49.920
And eh.. so My mother comes from that family

01:25:53.400 --> 01:25:55.120
And only Shalivahanas used to

01:25:55.200 --> 01:25:58.280
only marry Jadhavas or Jadhavas would marry the Shalivahanas.

01:26:04.760 --> 01:26:06.960
So now, these people invited Me there

01:26:07.200 --> 01:26:09.240
and they have given Me a huge land.

01:26:10.040 --> 01:26:13.400

uhh, but I refused to take.

01:26:16.360 --> 01:26:19.240
So, I just said give Me 11 acres for the time being

01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:48.800
Yogi: - for the village development also.

01:26:55.320 --> 01:26:56.799

01:27:02.240 --> 01:27:06.120
and his own, whole place where he lived - they want to give all that to Me.

01:27:15.840 --> 01:27:17.320
So, that place which is a

01:27:17.640 --> 01:27:21.000
the place where they lived, you see , I would like to use it

01:27:21.240 --> 01:27:22.440
for a music academy

for all our sahaja yogies to learn music.

01:27:37.680 --> 01:27:42.320
And I don't know what to do with the 300 acres so you better give Me idea.

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.440
Now, we've got another 30 acres of land

01:27:51.320 --> 01:27:53.160
near Neera that you've got.

01:27:58.200 --> 01:28:00.280
Then we have got another land

01:28:00.560 --> 01:28:04.760
in Poona itself that she has given it to Me personally.

01:28:09.120 --> 01:28:14.200
Then we have got another land, near Karzat, about 7 acres

01:28:21.600 --> 01:28:23.960

And one land we had, very beautiful one, of 1 acre of land

uh.. they were giving us

01:28:40.440 --> 01:28:43.719
but then they discovered that if they give us this land

01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:49.240
ah.. the, the gentleman, who is the owner, will get about 500 acres of land free.

01:28:49.520 --> 01:28:53.400

01:29:39.160 --> 01:29:40.840
next year will be the building year.

01:29:48.960 --> 01:29:52.240

01:29:52.960 --> 01:29:54.640

Give some [UNCLEAR]

01:30:39.040 --> 01:30:41.720
But, only thing I would expect uh.

01:30:41.880 --> 01:30:44.120
foreign sahaja yogies, all of them,

01:30:44.440 --> 01:30:45.759
have to donate

01:30:46.120 --> 01:30:48.480
51 pounds each, in this year, that's all.

01:31:03.080 --> 01:31:04.960
or a gold coin so we can,

01:31:05.200 --> 01:31:07.960
I can raise the price. - Yogi: [FRENCH]

01:31:08.640 --> 01:31:11.480
Eh. that is the not very difficult, I hope,

01:31:11.760 --> 01:31:13.440
and if it is difficult for some

01:31:13.680 --> 01:31:17.840
it's all right but - Yogi: [FRENCH]

01:31:17.880 --> 01:31:19.880
you see, Indian sahaja yogies

01:31:20.240 --> 01:31:21.360
have got 8 lakhs

01:31:22.080 --> 01:31:24.480
and Delhi sahaja yogies have got 6 lakhs.

01:31:24.600 --> 01:31:26.960
Bombay sahaja yogies 8 lakhs - 6 lakhs.

01:31:38.320 --> 01:31:40.960

01:31:40.960 --> 01:31:45.240
only

01:31:53.760 --> 01:31:54.880
and the garland [YOU KNOW?]

01:31:55.560 --> 01:32:00.440
So, I personally think that you should try to collect 51 pounds each

01:32:09.120 --> 01:32:12.400
and you give them the account we have, together.

01:32:47.920 --> 01:32:48.920
