00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:51.040
The child has got

00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:52.960
Agnya very badly on her.

00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:54.280
For the balance.

00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:58.280
Yogies: [FRENCH] - So you take some vibrated

00:42:58.440 --> 00:43:02.120
sindoor and also lemon and chillies will be good for this kind of [UNCLEAR]

00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:03.960
She's caught up with Agnya chakra.

00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:13.360
What about his grandparents?

00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:21.959
Does he go to his grandparents?

00:43:30.120 --> 00:43:30.960
What's it?

00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:34.959
Yogi: He says the parents of the mother

00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:37.280
Yogi: are not interested eh..

00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:39.960
Yogi: in Sahaja Yoga the.. - Parents of the mother? - Yogi: Yeah.

00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:41.439
But, does he go to them?

00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:46.960
Yogi: Very often - Ahh, that's it.

00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:49.960
And he's a Catho.. they're Catholic? - Yogi: [FRENCH]

00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:55.240
Yogi: Well, You know

00:43:56.240 --> 00:43:57.959
Yogi: not really - just registered.

00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:01.200
That's how he's catching from them

00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:04.200
in the.. Agnya, very badly.

00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:09.960
Yogi: [FRENCH]

00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:12.960
So, you shouldn't allow him to go too much there now.

00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:15.440
Yogi: [FRENCH]

00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:18.440
And when he sleeps you put this sindoor on his -

00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:19.960
- I'll give you vibrated -

00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:21.960
and lemon and chillies - very badly caught up

00:44:22.440 --> 00:44:24.960
and he must improve now - Like right now, is the case is just like Wyson

00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:01.960
Good idea!

00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:02.960
Hmm!

00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:12.000
You be careful about the baby.

00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:15.960
otherwise he'll become very adamant - his Agnya is just jutting out -

00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:17.160
you can see clearly.

00:45:17.400 --> 00:45:18.120
[UNCLEAR]

00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:19.200
Chance nahi lena.

00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:33.960
He'll become very..

00:45:35.240 --> 00:45:36.000
Hmm!

00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:39.960
So better stop as far as possible, slowly.

00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:51.080
Gradually reduce, I mean.

00:45:55.960 --> 00:45:56.960
Now, see!

00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:07.240
Yogi: Who?

00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:09.160
Alright?

00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:09.960
Great!

00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:13.959
Ha, ha .. ha, ha.

00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:15.240
May God bless you!

00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:16.960
[INAUDIBLE]

00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:19.960
Alright. Yogi: Jai Mataji! May God bless you!

00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:21.960
[UNCLEAR - ALRIGHT?]

00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:26.960
Now you know what it is to wash My feet.

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:30.960
Yogies: [LAUGH]

00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:32.960
Oh, May God bless you!

00:46:41.840 --> 00:46:43.400
Any more Paris people there?

00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:47.160
Have you washed?

00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:49.040
Yes, - Yogi: No. Mother. - Yes, come along.

00:46:49.960 --> 00:46:52.960
Who else is there? All Paris.. sit down.

00:46:53.080 --> 00:46:53.960
Alright.

00:47:04.120 --> 00:47:06.040
Now, is the [UNCLEAR]

00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:07.960
Yogi: Should we, Mother?

00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:11.960
Yogi: Should we read the name of the Virgin, the 51 names? - Yes, yes. Good idea.

00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:12.960
Yogi: In Latin?

00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:21.240
Yogi: [FRENCH]

00:47:21.320 --> 00:47:24.760
Yogi: [FRENCH]

00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:25.240
Now, you may put

00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:27.960
You may put [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:37.080 --> 00:47:37.960

Mr. [UNCLEAR]

00:51:49.960 --> 00:51:52.440
Then you people just pour it on.

00:52:33.960 --> 00:52:36.960
Pour some water. Bring some more.

00:53:06.360 --> 00:53:07.960
No yogurt

00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:18.080
Brass bowl?

00:53:19.960 --> 00:53:21.320
Never use it for yogurt.

00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:24.760
[UNCLEAR]

00:53:26.720 --> 00:53:27.720
Never use brass.

00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:31.320
We have a silver one?

00:53:41.800 --> 00:53:42.960
You've got yogurt here?

00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:49.960
They have yogurt.

00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:06.000
Unnh?

00:54:08.680 --> 00:54:09.799
Yogi: It's not white yogurt.

00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:12.360
Which one is there? - Yogi: [UNCLEAR], Mother.

00:54:19.800 --> 00:54:21.320
What [UNCLEAR] that is the water.

00:54:22.440 --> 00:54:24.440
The thing [UNCLEAR] of yogurt.

00:54:24.960 --> 00:54:25.960
Is it kept?

00:54:26.800 --> 00:54:29.800
Made of yogurt. - Yogi: [FRENCH]

00:54:29.920 --> 00:54:31.240
Yogi: [UNCLEAR] yes, Mother. - Yes.

00:54:41.080 --> 00:54:42.120
It's a very simple thing

00:54:42.960 --> 00:54:44.960
that yogurt should not be used in that

00:54:45.280 --> 00:54:48.960
but you can use it in this one. This is another metal.

00:54:49.360 --> 00:54:50.960
I don't know what you call this is

00:54:51.360 --> 00:54:52.960
'Kansa' it's called - this one.

00:54:54.040 --> 00:54:56.240
Is a brittle [UNCLEAR]

00:55:02.720 --> 00:55:04.720
No it's not - this is not brass.

00:55:05.960 --> 00:55:07.200

Yogi: [FRENCH]

00:55:09.960 --> 00:55:11.960
heavier one and brittle.

00:55:12.120 --> 00:55:13.319
Yogi: Brittle, I don't know.

00:55:15.080 --> 00:55:16.960

00:55:25.360 --> 00:55:26.040
What do you say?

00:55:26.440 --> 00:55:27.400
Brittle is

00:55:27.960 --> 00:55:29.960
something that breaks into little- little pieces.

00:55:32.960 --> 00:55:35.960
something that.. - Yogi: [FRENCH] - just the opposite of malleable.

00:55:36.360 --> 00:55:36.960

00:55:37.240 --> 00:55:38.160

00:56:01.360 --> 00:56:02.160

And I must tell you about this Shalivahana dynasty - you can see it

01:24:34.720 --> 01:24:36.960
worked out in a very wonderful way this time.

01:24:37.440 --> 01:24:39.360
Because they invited Me -

Yogi: [FRENCH]

01:25:07.520 --> 01:25:09.760
And the Nandgaon was

01:25:09.880 --> 01:25:13.320
used by Shivaji's Mother's side

01:25:13.560 --> 01:25:15.560
because they were hounded by

01:25:15.760 --> 01:25:18.040
the eh.. by Aurangzeb.

01:25:34.960 --> 01:25:36.400
They are called as Jadhavas.

01:25:36.760 --> 01:25:37.760
Jadhavs.

01:25:40.320 --> 01:25:43.280
The word comes from Yadav which was Krishna's vansh.

01:25:46.920 --> 01:25:49.920
And eh.. so My mother comes from that family

01:25:53.400 --> 01:25:55.120
And only Shalivahanas used to

01:25:55.200 --> 01:25:58.280
only marry Jadhavas or Jadhavas would marry the Shalivahanas.

01:26:04.760 --> 01:26:06.960
So now, these people invited Me there

01:26:07.200 --> 01:26:09.240
and they have given Me a huge land.

01:26:10.040 --> 01:26:13.400
They wanted to give Me first 176 acres of land

01:26:14.040 --> 01:26:16.200
uhh, but I refused to take.

01:26:16.360 --> 01:26:19.240
So, I just said give Me 11 acres for the time being

01:26:19.760 --> 01:26:21.760
in My mother's dynasty

01:26:21.920 --> 01:26:23.120
Yogi: A - My mother's place.

01:26:42.360 --> 01:26:45.240
That is the place we are going to use to establish our

Yogi: - for the village development also.

01:26:55.320 --> 01:26:56.799
And the other one the

01:26:56.960 --> 01:27:00.080
one in My father's place is 300

01:27:00.440 --> 01:27:01.960
acres of land

01:27:02.240 --> 01:27:06.120
and his own, whole place where he lived - they want to give all that to Me.

01:27:15.840 --> 01:27:17.320
So, that place which is a

01:27:17.640 --> 01:27:21.000
the place where they lived, you see , I would like to use it

01:27:21.240 --> 01:27:22.440
for a music academy

01:27:22.760 --> 01:27:24.080

for all our sahaja yogies to learn music.

01:27:37.680 --> 01:27:42.320
And I don't know what to do with the 300 acres so you better give Me idea.

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.440
Now, we've got another 30 acres of land

01:27:51.320 --> 01:27:53.160
near Neera that you've got.

01:27:58.200 --> 01:28:00.280
Then we have got another land

01:28:00.560 --> 01:28:04.760
in Poona itself that she has given it to Me personally.

01:28:09.120 --> 01:28:14.200
Then we have got another land, near Karzat, about 7 acres

01:28:21.600 --> 01:28:23.960
Ah.. now, there's one already we have

01:28:24.080 --> 01:28:26.200

1 acre of land in Sitkorni at Bombay.

01:28:35.160 --> 01:28:38.400
And one land we had, very beautiful one, of 1 acre of land

01:28:38.840 --> 01:28:40.240
uh.. they were giving us

01:28:40.440 --> 01:28:43.719
but then they discovered that if they give us this land

01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:49.240
ah.. the, the gentleman, who is the owner, will get about 500 acres of land free.

01:28:49.520 --> 01:28:53.400
