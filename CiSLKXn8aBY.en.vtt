00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:14.492
GUIDED MEDITATION
1979-1118 London (UK)

00:00:17.672 --> 00:00:22.051
Now first before meditating,
in your heart,

00:00:22.308 --> 00:00:28.749
or, you should see in your heart,

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:42.059
and there try to put your Guru
in the core of it.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.390
After establishing in the heart,

00:00:51.158 --> 00:00:54.676
you must bow to that

00:00:58.461 --> 00:01:02.609
with full devotion and dedication.

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:08.417
Now, whatever you do with your mind,
after Realisation,

00:01:08.618 --> 00:01:13.676
is not imagination because now
your mind,

00:01:13.877 --> 00:01:19.098
your imagination, is itself
enlightened.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:27.929
So project yourself in such a way
that you humble down

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.557
at the feet of your Guru

00:01:38.022 --> 00:01:51.453
and now ask for the necessary
temperament

00:01:51.654 --> 00:01:59.906
needed for meditation, or atmosphere
needed for meditation.

00:02:00.107 --> 00:02:08.278
Meditation is when you are one 
with the Divine.

00:02:10.507 --> 00:02:14.546
Now if there are thoughts
coming in,

00:02:15.905 --> 00:02:18.997
first you have to say the first mantra,
of course,

00:02:19.198 --> 00:02:22.667
and then watch inside.

00:02:25.359 --> 00:02:30.545
Also you must say mantra of Ganesha,
will help some people.

00:02:30.746 --> 00:02:34.704
And then you should watch
inside

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:45.692
and see for yourself which is
the biggest hurdle.

00:02:46.983 --> 00:02:49.974
First the thought.

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:58.505
Now, for the thought, you have to say
the mantra of Nirvichara,

00:02:58.706 --> 00:03:05.498
“Twameva sakshat
Nirvichar sakshat

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:10.568
Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi namoh namaha.”
Should say it thrice.

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:15.865
Yogis: OM TWAMEVA SAKSHAT
SHRI NIRVICHARA SAKSHAT

00:03:16.066 --> 00:03:22.443
SHRI MATAJI SHRI NIRMALA DEVI
NAMOH NAMAHA

00:03:22.644 --> 00:03:28.460
OM TWAMEVA SAKSHAT
SHRI NIRVICHARA SAKSHAT

00:03:28.661 --> 00:03:35.139
SHRI MATAJI SHRI NIRMALA DEVI
NAMOH NAMAHA

00:03:35.492 --> 00:03:41.259
OM TWAMEVA SAKSHAT
SHRI NIRVICHARA SAKSHAT

00:03:41.529 --> 00:03:48.282
SHRI MATAJI SHRI NIRMALA DEVI
NAMOH NAMAHA

00:03:48.483 --> 00:03:50.701
Shri Mataji: Now we come to the hurdle
of your ego

00:03:50.902 --> 00:03:53.703
because, you see, the thought has stopped
now, no doubt,

00:03:53.904 --> 00:03:56.545
but there’s still a pressure
on the head.

00:03:56.746 --> 00:04:00.798
So, if it is ego, you have to say,

00:04:00.999 --> 00:04:04.721
“Twameva sakshat Mahat-
Ahamkara…” -

00:04:04.922 --> 00:04:08.386
Mahat means ‘the great’, Ahamkara
means ‘the ego’ –

00:04:08.616 --> 00:04:17.111
“…sakshat Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi
namoh namaha.” Say it thrice.

00:04:17.413 --> 00:04:23.551
Yogis: OM TWAMEVA SAKSHAT
SHRI MAHAT-AHAMKARA SAKSHAT

00:04:23.855 --> 00:04:31.936
SHRI ADI SHAKTI SAKSHAT
SHRI NIRMALA DEVI NAMOH NAMAHA

00:04:32.143 --> 00:04:38.330
OM TWAMEVA SAKSHAT
SHRI MAHAT-AHAMKARA SAKSHAT

00:04:38.546 --> 00:04:46.029
SHRI MATAJI SHRI NIRMALA DEVI
NAMOH NAMAHA. Shri Mataji: Again.

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:52.299
Yogis: OM TWAMEVA SAKSHAT
SHRI MAHAT-AHAMKARA SAKSHAT

00:04:52.538 --> 00:04:58.197
SHRI MATAJI SHRI NIRMALA DEVI
NAMOH NAMAHA

00:04:58.408 --> 00:05:03.353
Shri Mataji: Now, even now, if you find
that ego is still there,

00:05:03.554 --> 00:05:08.922
then you have to raise your left side
to push it back

00:05:09.123 --> 00:05:15.511
to the right hand side, with your hand;
one hand towards the photograph.

00:05:18.986 --> 00:05:22.318
Push the left side higher and right
side lower

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:26.975
so the ego and super-ego
get the balance.

00:05:34.651 --> 00:05:37.709
Do it seven times.

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:43.364
Try to feel it, how you are feeling 
nside, you see.

00:05:54.940 --> 00:06:03.753
Now you raise your Kundalini up
on the head and tie it up.

00:06:05.511 --> 00:06:13.585
Again raise your Kundalini up
on the head and tie it up.

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:21.066
Again raise your Kundalini
and tie it up.

00:06:22.966 --> 00:06:25.631
Hmm.

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:36.010
Now at the Sahastrara you should say
the mantra of Sahastrara, thrice.

00:06:36.283 --> 00:06:42.207
Yogis: OM TWAMEVA SAKSHAT
SHRI KALKI SAKSHAT

00:06:42.408 --> 00:06:47.990
SHRI SAHASTRARA SWAMINI
MOKSHA PRADAYINI MATAJI

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:53.359
SHRI NIRMALA DEVI
NAMOH NAMAHA

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:59.580
OM TWAMEVA SAKSHAT
SHRI KALKI SAKSHAT

00:06:59.781 --> 00:07:05.573
SHRI SAHASTRARA SWAMINI
MOKSHA PRADAYINI MATAJI

00:07:05.774 --> 00:07:11.199
SHRI NIRMALA DEVI
NAMOH NAMAHA

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:17.663
OM TWAMEVA SAKSHAT
SHRI KALKI SAKSHAT

00:07:17.864 --> 00:07:23.616
SHRI SAHASTRARA SWAMINI
MOKSHA PRADAYINI MATAJI

00:07:23.912 --> 00:07:30.314
SHRI NIRMALA DEVI
NAMOH NAMAHA

00:07:30.528 --> 00:07:33.327
Shri Mataji: Now it’s opened out
if you see.

00:07:33.528 --> 00:07:36.703
Now you can open again your
Sahastrara like this.

00:07:36.904 --> 00:07:40.520
Just take it down again and see
that you are stationed there.

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:43.945
Once this has been done then
you go into meditation.

00:07:44.146 --> 00:07:50.360
This is like cleansing, you see,
called as nyasa.

00:07:52.425 --> 00:07:54.592
Now.

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:09.999
Now, if you find any other obstruction,
you can also say,

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:13.511
like, if you have got, say,
Mahakali’s problem,

00:08:13.712 --> 00:08:21.413
you can say that mantra, clear it
and then you sit down for meditation.

00:08:29.868 --> 00:08:33.020
Any individual thing, you can
take it out.

00:08:33.221 --> 00:08:35.138
Like, if you have the ego problem,
if you think,

00:08:35.339 --> 00:08:37.525
then you should start with
Mahat-Ahamkara.

00:08:37.726 --> 00:08:41.119
It is what you have to find out:
What is your problem?

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:47.736
Where is the Kundalini stopping?
You can feel it within yourself.

00:09:12.166 --> 00:09:14.124
Some of you may not feel.

00:09:14.325 --> 00:09:17.819
If you do not feel it, feel it
on your fingers.

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:24.345
If you are not feeling within yourself then
feel it on your fingers, you can feel it.

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:30.565
Ah, Better.

00:09:30.827 --> 00:09:35.624
(Missing audio: “Reduce your
breathing, will be better.

00:09:35.825 --> 00:09:40.819
Reduce your breathing as if stopping,
but no exertion about it.”)

00:09:41.455 --> 00:09:48.252
How is it now? Better? Where is
the problem?

00:09:51.375 --> 00:09:55.411
Hmm?
Yogi: Central heart.

00:09:55.612 --> 00:10:01.639
Shri Mataji: Central heart? Alright,
hold your breath.

00:10:02.284 --> 00:10:05.833
Not with great force, just
ordinarily. Alright?

00:10:06.042 --> 00:10:19.164
AHAM SAKSHAT JAGADAMBA
(x 10)

00:10:21.544 --> 00:10:24.963
Alright? Leave it.

00:10:31.788 --> 00:10:38.607
Better now? Once again? Alright,
hold your breath.

00:10:38.808 --> 00:10:46.878
AHAM SAKSHAT JAGADAMBA
(x 7)

00:10:47.079 --> 00:10:50.529
Haa. Leave it.

00:10:55.782 --> 00:11:01.629
Better. Keep your eyes open.
Again. Hold it.

00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:13.558
AHAM SAKSHAT JAGADAMBA
(x 9)

00:11:13.759 --> 00:11:20.909
Leave it. Better now?

00:11:24.161 --> 00:11:28.051
Much relief. Alright?

00:11:28.252 --> 00:11:32.594
I mean, now left side.

00:11:33.198 --> 00:11:37.468
Put your left hand towards Me,
right hand up there.

00:11:37.669 --> 00:11:41.411
Left hand towards Me,
right hand like that…

00:11:45.644 --> 00:11:47.912
Hmm.

00:12:01.733 --> 00:12:04.162
Hmm.

00:12:06.183 --> 00:12:10.737
Like this. Douglas (Fry),
like this.

00:12:14.933 --> 00:12:19.276
Better? See, liver.

00:12:22.127 --> 00:12:28.873
Over-thinking gives you
liver also. Better?

00:12:35.284 --> 00:12:38.119
Much better.

00:12:39.771 --> 00:12:42.737
It’s coming down.

00:13:02.099 --> 00:13:07.000
Hmm. Better now?

00:13:07.379 --> 00:13:10.435
What is it?

00:13:10.967 --> 00:13:15.333
Where do you feel? Vishuddhi?
