WEBVTT

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:37.130
At the very outset we have to know that truth is what it is.

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:44.810
We cannot organize it, we cannot change it,

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:53.110
we cannot order it, we live to accept it

00:05:54.330 --> 00:06:02.290
as it is. The Truth is that

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:09.830
this whole universe is guided,

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:17.830
organized by a very subtle power

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:26.530
that [UNCLEAR] had to plan it that Param Chaitanya

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:34.790
or as they call it as Ruh in Koran

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:39.570
or as [UNCLEAR - COOL BREEZE?] in the Bible.

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:50.990
In those days of Science, for a modern man is too much to accept

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:59.230
that there could be something

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:04.050
like a subtle energy which organizes

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:10.090
Logically we can accept up to a point

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:17.550
to understand so many things which have no answer in Science

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:22.830
but beyond thought, beyond the intellect

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:29.490
if we can reach into another great truth about ourselves

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:37.850
- that is, if you become the Spirit, if you get your Atmasakshatkar,

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:45.350
then, you can feel

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:51.890
that subtle energy on your finger-tips, on your hands.

00:07:54.370 --> 00:08:02.270
Also, as a result of this power, the residual power of the Kundalini,

00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:07.330
which is like this cord,

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:16.130
which rises, pierces through six centers, passes through your fontanel bone area

00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:20.910
you can also feel the cool breeze coming out of your own head.

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:29.110
This is the ultimate goal of our human life.

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:37.190
You know the Absolute Truth not relative. What we know, is the relative truth.

00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:42.410
Unless and until this happening takes place within us,

00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:48.210
whatever we know is so relative that

00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:53.750
one person may not agree with another person.

00:08:55.290 --> 00:09:02.950
In one family there may be disagreement but once you reach to this state of Self-realization,

00:09:03.970 --> 00:09:11.430
there is no difference at all in understanding it that [UNCLEAR]

00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:22.050
It is a very ancient science of our country. In the West,

00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:27.770
I would say,  the civilization grew like a tree

00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:35.630
but the roots are here in the Orient and these roots are

00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:43.470
like a knowledge of nourishment for [UNCLEAR]

00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:52.630
If you allow the [UNCLEAR] to grow without finding out it's roots and the nourishment for it,

00:09:53.790 --> 00:10:01.150
it's definite, that such a tree will have to get completely destroyed.

00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:10.310
To understand that

00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:18.530
what I'm saying is the truth, you have to have little scientific attitude towards it.

00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:27.590
A scientist has to have an open mind to see for himself, that whatever I'm saying,

00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:33.510
if it is true, then one has to accept it.

00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:40.990
First this is like a hypothesis and if this hypothesis can be proved

00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:46.170
then, as honest people you have to accept because this is

00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:54.030
for the benevolence of every individual, of every society, of every country

00:10:54.950 --> 00:11:00.870
and the whole of the human emancipation

00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:07.790
because when this happening takes place, the

00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:15.310
transformation of the personality - complete transformation.

00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:22.650
It's very amazing because so fantastic that people cannot believe it that

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:27.530
one can be transformed but what is it?

00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:32.890
Like a, if you take a [UNCLEAR] clean

00:11:34.090 --> 00:11:37.930
[UNCLEAR] that it's just a box

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:44.830
but if you put that connected to the mains,

00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:49.610
then you find, it's fantastic.

00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:57.230
In the same way, a human-being is a tremendous

00:11:59.610 --> 00:12:05.850
powerful personality within himself and the power is that of love

00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:14.550
and compassion. You have never used the power of love - you have only used the power of hatred, so far.

00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:24.530
Once the person gets transformed, he becomes dynamic, very dynamic,

00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:29.630
relaxed, becomes like a witness of the whole play

00:12:30.490 --> 00:12:37.530
and all that is described about saints, you can see all that working out within you.

00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:47.110
And this man analyzes

00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:52.750
and by not understanding it through mental capacity,

00:12:54.050 --> 00:12:59.490
inhibit [UNCLEAR] up the idea

00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:06.130
of God Almighty and His powers - that's not true.

00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:16.270
Just for a short time at least the [UNCLEAR - GLANCE?] have come but whatever is done, has to accept it

00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:19.870
and unless and until you find internal [UNCLEAR]

00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:25.810
we are not going to be satisfied, we are not going to be happy.

00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:34.610
I don't know what Mr. Murthy has told you about but the first thing that happens

00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:42.890
when this kundalini rises, is that you get [UNCLEAR]

00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:50.470
your sicknesses are cured because all the sickness,

00:13:50.750 --> 00:13:56.790
mental or physical, comes from the disturbances in the chakra

00:13:58.070 --> 00:14:04.910
in the centers, in the subtle centers which are partly in our spinal cord

00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:09.050
and partly in our brain.

00:14:11.310 --> 00:14:18.490
If these centers can be put right and could be nourished by the awakening of the Kundalini,

00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:24.230
then, you feel the well-being

00:14:24.490 --> 00:14:28.430
of your health, also your mental capacity.

00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:34.490
I can tell you many things that can happen.

00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:40.270
We have known many children who were supposed to be very dull in their classes,

00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:45.470
they stood first class first, they got schloarships, they're doing very well.

00:14:46.050 --> 00:14:53.930
On the mental side there have been many people who suffered from mental extremes and diseases of [UNCLEAR] also manifest in the being

00:14:54.330 --> 00:15:00.270
schizophrenia - they have been cured. There's a doctor in

00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:09.950
Delhi, who has got now his MD, where he has shown that epilepsy can be cured through sahaja yog.

00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:15.650
There are three doctors who have got MD

00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:23.470
and surprisingly when we went to Russia, they saw all our papers and amazingly,

00:15:23.950 --> 00:15:28.650
immediately they accepted sahaja yoga as an independent organization.

00:15:29.410 --> 00:15:33.210
This is the only organization which is independent in Russia

00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:37.910
and they say, they had no conditioning of any kind.

00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:45.570
In our country we have conditionings of man made religions.

00:15:46.810 --> 00:15:53.990
Most of these religions have nothing to do with the people who created [UNCLEAR],

00:15:55.250 --> 00:16:01.590
they have nothing to do with the Incarnations, nothing to do with the prophets

00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:08.730
and nothing to do with the saints. On the contrary all the saints, Incarnations

00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:16.790
have [UNCLEAR] tortured by the same people who say that they are in charge of the religion.

00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:26.150
I have seen in the West, that the religions are naturally

00:16:26.850 --> 00:16:32.130
we came to atheism, we start telling the [UNCLEAR]

00:16:33.450 --> 00:16:40.130
there's no God. The religion is within ourselves. The religion is our valency.

00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:47.890
Like in the matter there are [UNCLEAR] up to eight valencies. In the human-beings there are ten valencies

00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:52.530
and once these ten valencies get disturbed, you fall into trouble

00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:58.090
and you start deteriorating in your health and also in  moral values.

00:16:59.130 --> 00:17:06.050
So, to re-establish yourself, you have to have this last job of breakthrough in your evolution

00:17:06.370 --> 00:17:12.770
from human awareness to this of, what we call as, the collective consciousness

00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:20.390
which is just felt on your finger-tips. In the evolution [UNCLEAR] all about.

00:17:21.610 --> 00:17:29.010
In any case, I'll be very happy if you can ask Me some questions today, so I could know what are the problems

00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:35.670
that are affecting your mind, for sometime and then we'll have the Self-realization

00:17:36.290 --> 00:17:43.910
after that. First thing, you should not be diffident; Everybody is capable of having Self-realization.

00:17:44.410 --> 00:17:49.770
Everyone can get Self-realization, so nobody should feel anyway diffident about it.

00:17:51.190 --> 00:17:56.670
If you want, you can ask Me some questions now. I want to give some time for that.

00:17:56.890 --> 00:18:03.890
If you people can come forward, it would be better because it is such a big hall. You just please - if you can come forward, would be better.

00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:08.350
[ASIDE - Chashma de do, chashma]

00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:24.650
Shri Mataji, I would like to know how to awaken the Kundalini?

00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:30.570
That's very simple. That I will do, that I will manage - it's spontaneous.

00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:37.570
It's like sprouting of the seed which is a living process - it's a living process.

00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:41.950
Through a living process we have become human-beings from amoeba stage

00:18:42.290 --> 00:18:47.850
and to go higher is also a living process. It just acts spontaneously.

00:18:48.190 --> 00:18:55.410
First, I'll awaken your Kundalini - just not much to be done and then you can awaken the Kundalini of others.

00:18:55.870 --> 00:18:59.670
It's very simple. Very good question.

00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:06.290
Mataji, the Veda is the result of the deep meditation of our ancient sages

00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:12.650
in the Ritambhara Pragya and Your sahaja yog samadhi also deals with this

00:19:13.090 --> 00:19:16.890
and what is Your experience parallel to Veda of these vibes?

00:19:17.230 --> 00:19:23.350
You see, Vedas were, I would say, there were three movements in our country in those days.

00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:30.670
One was on the side of Vedas where - the first, first time that they said it that,

00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:38.730
"If by reading and doing all these Vedas, if you do not get your Self-realization, it is of no use."

00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:46.490
Then the same wave find, in those days there were three systems - one was, people were trying to

00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:53.290
exploit or to find out the way to use the matter

00:19:54.250 --> 00:20:00.350
and that's how the Vedas started to awaken the Vedas through spiritual powers

00:20:00.690 --> 00:20:04.890
and that is what is the Vedas it is. And the another side is,

00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:09.470
and that's the outcome of is is [UNCLEAR].

00:20:10.210 --> 00:20:17.170
The another side is the one where we have bhakti. People used to do bhakti and

00:20:17.770 --> 00:20:22.970
devotion. They used to go emotionally about finding God.

00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:30.590
This, the central path was for, actually, redemption and for awakening the Kundalini

00:20:30.870 --> 00:20:38.110
which was done by mostly the Nathpanthis like Machindernath, Gorakhnath, Adinath - these people did it.

00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:42.810
Moreover, also you must have heard that

00:20:43.810 --> 00:20:50.590
Janaka, the father of Sita, gave realization to one Nachiketa - only one person.

00:20:50.910 --> 00:20:58.330
So, at that time there were very few flowers on the tree of life and that's why very few people got realization.

00:20:58.670 --> 00:21:05.570
First of all, their basic cleansing [UNCLEAR] through the Vedas - cleansing it and awakening it.

00:21:05.850 --> 00:21:12.610
The another side was, they tried to build their emotional side to receive the blessings

00:21:13.390 --> 00:21:19.990
but the awakening of the Kundalini was done in very few people

00:21:20.490 --> 00:21:27.830
and very few people, few people got realization in those days. Now the time has come that,

00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:33.110
I feel, there's a blossom time and many people can get Self-realization.

00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:38.750
So, the difference between the sahaja yoga that was followed long time back and today is this,

00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:46.390
that in those days they had to cleanse like [UNCLEAR] from the body and out of that they used to get one person

00:21:46.690 --> 00:21:54.070
and they would say that to be born again and again, come back again and again - cleansing was done periodically in different

00:21:54.270 --> 00:21:59.110
lives and that's how then they got realization one person here and there.

00:22:00.610 --> 00:22:06.930
But in sahaja yoga there are two things which we have been able to manage.

00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:15.330
First thing, you can give en-masse realization. [UNCLEAR] Kundalini can be awakened

00:22:16.890 --> 00:22:20.990
and it can pierce through your fontanel bone area

00:22:22.170 --> 00:22:27.030
but in that little light you start seeing yourself.

00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:30.710
As I said that, if there's a snake in your hand,

00:22:31.170 --> 00:22:37.430
you're standing in the dark and somebody tells you, "There's a snake in your hand," you may say that, "It's not, it's a rope,"

00:22:37.670 --> 00:22:43.690
but if there's a little light, you can see that, you will just drop it. So, the cleansing is done by you only

00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:49.070
nobody else can do the cleansing - first. The second thing is that

00:22:49.250 --> 00:22:54.450
you yourself get all the powers of awakening the Kundalini, you get all the knowledge about Kundalini,

00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:59.210
so you can spread it fast. We can say that as it is a jet age

00:22:59.450 --> 00:23:04.990
we also have to have a jet Kundalini and it has to work that way. So it has grown up to that.

00:23:05.290 --> 00:23:13.330
My contribution to this is only, is this that I wanted to find out a en-masse way of giving realization to people

00:23:13.530 --> 00:23:18.570
because one person is Atmasakshatkari, one person can say, "It's gossip."

00:23:19.710 --> 00:23:25.930
Moreover, any discovery, say the discovery of electricity, if it was meant for one or two persons, it was

00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:32.550
never accepted nor of any value. So the time has come for this en-masse evolution

00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:40.730
and this is working out through this modern sahaja yog. There's no way we are discarding Vedas or the bhakti part of it

00:23:41.170 --> 00:23:47.270
but the essence of it, the core of it was to receive Atmasakshatkara, which is achieved through sahaja yoga.

00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:51.670
So we can say, this is the culmination of all these things in modern times.

00:23:55.290 --> 00:23:59.930
Shri Mataji, how one could realize that Kundalini has been awakened?

00:24:00.150 --> 00:24:07.870
That is what I was doing. That point you leave. I'm very happy to hear that; That's a real sadhaka - I see the question. May God bless you!

00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:14.790
[UNCLEAR QUESTION FROM AUDIENCE]

00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:21.650
[UNCLEAR] It wasn't very clear. Now some school of thought

00:24:21.910 --> 00:24:29.770
believe that the Kundalini can be raised from the Sushumna through the spinal cord at the back of the body.

00:24:30.290 --> 00:24:37.170
Now what we see in this picture, we raise from the Mooladhara up to the Sahastrara, in the front portion

00:24:37.470 --> 00:24:42.090
so what is the difference of our Kundalini enunciation and here that...

00:24:42.330 --> 00:24:48.050
[UNCLEAR]

00:24:48.350 --> 00:24:54.630
[UNCLEAR N INAUDIBLE]

00:24:54.990 --> 00:25:00.750
No, no it is on the back. It is in the chart how to show the back so [UNCLEAR]

00:25:00.970 --> 00:25:05.750
it is not - it is on the front. Of course, the Sushumna Nadi is the Brahmanadi.

00:25:05.950 --> 00:25:12.270
The Sushumna has also got inside, a very sukshma nadi, called Brahmanadi. Through that only few,

00:25:12.530 --> 00:25:19.650
few threads of Kundalini rises first and then it starts opening the chakra and then more threads come up

00:25:19.850 --> 00:25:23.790
So, it is not in the front - it is correct.

00:25:25.290 --> 00:25:32.870
- Veda gives us three aspects as You said - that is karma, bhakti and gyana. Gyana is the [UNCLEAR]
- Alright

00:25:33.050 --> 00:25:38.330
and it has been accepted. So, but to acquire gyana no karma or no action is necessary?

00:25:38.530 --> 00:25:43.670
- No
- Here this is also a mental action or how do You [UNCLEAR] this?

00:25:43.890 --> 00:25:50.170
No, no, no there is nothing to be done. Who told you? Please sit down. Don't be aggressive - just try to understand.

00:25:50.410 --> 00:25:55.790
Gyana is something that you feel on your Central Nervous System [UNCLEAR]

00:25:56.030 --> 00:26:01.190
is Bodha - alright? Now, you don't have to do anything [UNCLEAR - IS THAT CLEAR?]

00:26:01.650 --> 00:26:04.610
It is spontaneous, it's a living process.

00:26:05.250 --> 00:26:11.290
You don't have to do anything. If you have to do anything, then it is not. Don't have to do anything.

00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:20.330
Only thing, once you get your realization, you have to know where are your centers, what is your problem, how to correct them.

00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:27.470
That is to settle because first you give a connection - suppose - and if it is loose, then you should know how to make it proper

00:26:27.710 --> 00:26:31.650
because, as it is you know, human-beings have problems

00:26:31.910 --> 00:26:37.290
and the Kundalini knows, because She is your individual mother. Every person has his own Kundalini

00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:43.210
and every Kundalini has recorded what that person carries and that Kundalini

00:26:43.430 --> 00:26:50.350
knows each and every thing about you, so when She rises - She rises although but then again She settles back

00:26:50.530 --> 00:26:55.530
into the places where you have problems, so you must know how to fix it up - that's all.

00:26:57.670 --> 00:27:03.830
Who, what made you think that you have to do something? Don't have to do. You can't even pay for it, you can't do anything.

00:27:04.150 --> 00:27:07.370
It may work it may not work. There's no guarantee.

00:27:07.990 --> 00:27:13.810
It may work, it may not work. In some people it does not work. In some people it works immediately.

00:27:14.490 --> 00:27:19.110
So it has to do also [UNCLEAR] also [UNCLEAR] on

00:27:19.510 --> 00:27:22.750
inner being. Suppose, you have some sickness

00:27:23.070 --> 00:27:30.070
you have some mental problems, you have some terrible conditions, then it may not rise but we have to give it a chance.

00:27:31.710 --> 00:27:36.910
Like, if there's a bad seed, it may not sprout. Then, there may be a seed which is not properly planted

00:27:37.070 --> 00:27:41.270
something like that may happen but most of the people do get realization.

00:27:44.970 --> 00:27:49.610
Any bad [UNCLEAR] is a good being [UNCLEAR]

00:27:49.910 --> 00:27:53.630
[UNCLEAR]

00:27:55.110 --> 00:28:00.890
That is not just now the problem is. You see, whatever you have written or whatever you have done, is alright.

00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:06.890
Whatever you have done in the past, you have to forget. You have to be in the present. First thing you must know is to forgive yourself

00:28:07.090 --> 00:28:13.270
and not to think what wrong you have done, what wrong things they have done or the other, sinner and all that nonsense you don't have to think about.

00:28:13.430 --> 00:28:18.070
You must know that everybody can get realization - there's no problem.

00:28:18.290 --> 00:28:24.010
Only thing, you just, if you start thinking about your past and blaming yourself or feeling guilty, then it's difficult.

00:28:24.170 --> 00:28:31.070
Then you catch this center here - very difficult to raise the Kundalini. So, to raise your Kundalini, you have to

00:28:31.530 --> 00:28:36.350
know one thing that you are a human-being and it is your right,

00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:40.390
it's your birthright to get this Atma Sakshatkar.

00:28:45.950 --> 00:28:51.550
There's nothing to worry about just now, about food. You see, after realization you will know

00:28:51.690 --> 00:28:55.910
what sort of a person you are and then accordingly you have to adjust your food.

00:28:56.930 --> 00:29:03.210
Supposing, if you are a right-sided person, then you have to take more of carbohydrates. If you are a left-sided person,

00:29:03.590 --> 00:29:10.130
then you have to take more of proteins; It depends on what sort of a personality you are because [UNCLEAR]

00:29:10.350 --> 00:29:15.930
So, first you have to know what sort of a personality you are and accordingly you should deal with it.

00:29:18.130 --> 00:29:23.410
Mother, once the Kundalini has been risen, will it come down again?

00:29:23.790 --> 00:29:29.790
- [UNCLEAR - PLEASE BE SEATED?]
- Suppose you're practicing meditation everyday then it comes to a certain state.

00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:36.450
Now, I [UNCLEAR - STOP?] meditation for next one week or one month, will it come down or will it stay where it is?

00:29:37.190 --> 00:29:43.430
It depends on you. Please be seated, I'll explain. I said, sit. The Kundalini certainly rises,

00:29:45.010 --> 00:29:50.410
no doubt, it has risen but sometimes, you see,

00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:57.130
in the beginning, as like a little sapling, it may die out if you do not look after it.

00:29:57.610 --> 00:30:03.870
In the same way, in the beginning you have to be little careful, must know everything about it, respect it

00:30:04.170 --> 00:30:09.070
and if it is established, it doesn't. Now, as you have seen Mr. Murthy, he came to Bombay

00:30:09.570 --> 00:30:14.170
for his sickness is a [UNCLEAR] his wife also and that's how he came

00:30:14.450 --> 00:30:21.610
because when he got his Self-realization, he came to Madras, he started giving realization to people. They had never seen.

00:30:22.110 --> 00:30:27.090
All their Kundalinis are alright, working out but some people

00:30:27.450 --> 00:30:34.210
even after coming to sahaja yoga do not pay so much attention to it and sometimes may,

00:30:34.550 --> 00:30:42.490
sometimes may lose the chance. So, you have to be little careful that within seven days you can fix up yourself

00:30:42.930 --> 00:30:50.470
but some people never lose it - it's just there. Supposing, somebody has a liver problem, then the Kundalini will go to the liver to [UNCLEAR] it first

00:30:50.690 --> 00:30:55.410
and then to rise it later by in Her own working you must know how to raise it.

00:30:55.630 --> 00:31:02.430
That's a very simple technique which you can work it out for which you don't have to pay anything, it's not [UNCLEAR].

00:31:04.850 --> 00:31:11.710
[UNCLEAR]

00:31:11.930 --> 00:31:18.970
- [UNCLEAR]
- Can you come forward please?

00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:26.030
It's a very big hall na, so we can't hear you properly and echo is there. Kya keh rahin?

00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:32.930
If through Kundalini awakening people can be cured, how is it that Incarnation

00:31:33.450 --> 00:31:38.430
- have will be known to suffer from disease?
- No Incarnation has suffered

00:31:39.150 --> 00:31:45.990
- Even Ramkrishna and Ramana Maharishi
- Ramkrishna and Raman Maharishi were not incarnations.

00:31:46.330 --> 00:31:52.690
and they didn't have Mother to tell them - that's the problem - otherwise they could have cured definitely.

00:31:53.030 --> 00:31:59.110
You see, somebody has to tell us also, so they suffered especially Ramana Maharishi

00:31:59.450 --> 00:32:05.450
but nobody was there to tell them. As soon as you catch on anything,

00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:13.330
immediately you know, as a sahaja yogi. That's why it is necessary to be a sahaja yogi, so you have  the full knowledge of the Kundalini - alright?

00:32:15.730 --> 00:32:21.050
[UNCLEAR]

00:32:21.350 --> 00:32:27.450
[HINDI - Usspe to aur bhi nahin sunai de raha] Just stand little away from it because of echoes.

00:32:27.690 --> 00:32:32.590
[UNCLEAR] Atma-sakshatkar thereby completely absorbing ourselves

00:32:32.870 --> 00:32:40.850
when you meditate for sometime and by forgetting everything and keeping everything inside, so how do you come to know that Atma-sakshatkar is taking place.

00:32:41.330 --> 00:32:45.730
- (HINDI - Mujhe to samajh nahin aaya) I couldn't understand it.
- [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:46.190 --> 00:32:51.490
Alright, when, how will you know? That's a good idea. Please be seated I'll tell you, please.

00:32:52.330 --> 00:32:58.910
When you get your Atma-sakshatkara first thing happens, that you feel the cool breeze coming out of your head.

00:32:59.810 --> 00:33:06.090
Then you feel completely Nirvichar - first is nirvichar samadhi is established,

00:33:06.390 --> 00:33:12.410
then you feel the cool breeze in your hand - all over you can feel the cool breeze; This is the beginning.

00:33:12.770 --> 00:33:20.570
Sometimes you do feel little heat because it's liver problem, other diseases, then you might feel little heat but after sometime you start feeling the cool breeze.

00:33:21.330 --> 00:33:28.550
Then you must use. By using this you'll be satisfied that you have got these powers.

00:33:43.270 --> 00:33:48.790
One may go to samadhi and have bliss there but that is not the [UNCLEAR].

00:33:49.050 --> 00:33:54.010
You see, Veda declared 'Satyam Gyanam Anantam'; these are the doctrines of Veda.

00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:58.850
- That's why, that's why
- Satya is [UNCLEAR], Gyana is knowledge, Ananta means endless.

00:33:59.050 --> 00:34:06.030
This is Your state. When this is the state in the state of samadhi, one have, have a little amount of bliss while in samadhi.

00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:13.690
- When he comes back, when he comes back, you'll have to undergo the prarabhda so he has to [UNCLEAR]
- Alright, I'll tell you.

00:34:13.950 --> 00:34:21.110
It means you have read too much but not felt anything - that's why but now either your prarabhda and your karmas

00:34:21.390 --> 00:34:28.850
all these things can be sucked in by Kundalini - She's so powerful. How She sucks in that there's  the Agnya chakra - you see there.

00:34:29.690 --> 00:34:35.270
This Agnya chakra - tomorrow I was going to tell you all these things but today you want to know, I'll tell you,

00:34:35.570 --> 00:34:42.210
that on the left hand side is the Ida Nadi, the right hand side is the Pingala Nadi. Ida nadi is the

00:34:42.490 --> 00:34:47.950
power of our desire and take us to our subconscious and collective subconscious.

00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:54.850
The right side is the Pingala Nadi which caters to our

00:34:57.030 --> 00:35:01.930
supra-conscious and collective supra-conscious - the future.

00:35:02.770 --> 00:35:09.850
Now, left side is the one which is the Ichcha shakti, is the power of desire

00:35:10.530 --> 00:35:16.510
and the another one, that's the Pingala Nadi, is the one is the reaction.

00:35:16.990 --> 00:35:21.710
So, when you're doing something and you feel you are doing it, doing [UNCLEAR]

00:35:22.110 --> 00:35:28.170
then that ego accumulates and forms an institution, as you see there, on your head.

00:35:28.450 --> 00:35:33.190
Here all the conditionings - the kusanskaras - also form another institution

00:35:33.450 --> 00:35:38.790
which is called as superego but you can say mana, so we have two things.

00:35:39.010 --> 00:35:44.990
On one side is the superego, another is the ego. They cross each other at Agnya.

00:35:45.490 --> 00:35:49.750
When the Kundalini rises, then She sucks these two things

00:35:50.030 --> 00:35:56.490
by which your prarabhda, your karmas, are sucked in. It actually happens because

00:35:57.330 --> 00:36:04.050
when these two are joined, this fontanel bone area becomes a calcified

00:36:04.530 --> 00:36:10.730
but then the Kundalini rises, they open out like this. The limbic area is in between this [UNCLEAR].

00:36:10.950 --> 00:36:18.890
It opens out like that and when it pierces through that, you get your Self-realization.

00:36:19.150 --> 00:36:25.010
But it cannot pierce through unless and until sucked in. It sucks in quite a lot in the first beginning

00:36:25.270 --> 00:36:30.290
but later on it goes on sucking more and more so you become ego-less

00:36:30.510 --> 00:36:36.610
and all your prarabhdas and karmas are sucked in; That's the work of Kundalini - She does it.

00:36:39.330 --> 00:36:43.890
It's not question of how much you have read. It's the question of experiencing -

00:36:44.210 --> 00:36:49.190
you must experience. You know, even Shankaracharya, he was such a great soul

00:36:49.390 --> 00:36:56.690
and how, there was Mr. Sharma got after him by discussion discussion so that he has written such a nice

00:36:56.870 --> 00:37:03.490
treatise of Vivek Chudamani, which he gave it up and he just wrote Saundarya Lahiri because he knew that

00:37:03.650 --> 00:37:07.870
this discussion will lead nowhere - there is no tarq about it. You have to experience.

00:37:07.990 --> 00:37:13.150
By tarquas you are not going to reach there . You will only reach there through experience.

00:37:14.890 --> 00:37:18.370
So, humbly one should ask for that experience.

00:37:19.350 --> 00:37:26.990
By tarq you cannot.... logic can go up to a point because it is very linear. It moves only one direction and it again comes round.

00:37:27.390 --> 00:37:34.510
It's rationality not logic even, it's rationality because logic could be supported by these people but it's just rationality.

00:37:34.930 --> 00:37:41.550
So, one has to understand that whatever you have read has to be proved otherwise what's the use of reading everything.

00:37:43.070 --> 00:37:46.410
Like Nanaka has said,

00:37:47.170 --> 00:37:51.810
"Kahe Nanak bin aapa khoje mite na bhram ki khai."

00:37:52.110 --> 00:37:58.150
Nanak says that, "Unless and until you find out yourself, the illusion will not go," so they go on reading

00:37:58.330 --> 00:38:04.210
Now it's said, "You have got a headache, alright, you take Anacin." Then you go on reading, "Take Anacin, take Anacin."

00:38:04.450 --> 00:38:10.050
By that your headache is not going to go; You have to do it, you have to take it. The experience has to be taken.

00:38:10.390 --> 00:38:16.310
Unless and until you have the experience, it's just talk, talk, talk, talk, talk and that has been quite a lot.

00:38:17.070 --> 00:38:23.610
So, by only understanding mentally, you do not work it out. Everything that you have learnt now

00:38:23.770 --> 00:38:29.310
through your books can only be actualized if you have your Self-realization otherwise it cannot be.

00:38:29.790 --> 00:38:35.670
You must know all the saints they never went to any University, they never read any Vedas, nothing.

00:38:36.330 --> 00:38:42.030
Like Gyaneshwara, at the age of 23 years, wrote not only Gyaneshwari but the great book called Amrut Anubhav.

00:38:42.230 --> 00:38:49.570
I mean, two stanzas of that you cannot write, it's so deep; Only an Atmasakshatkari can understand the beauty of it.

00:38:49.770 --> 00:38:55.990
and that is the level is so different from the normal level of intelligence, reading or anything

00:38:56.230 --> 00:39:03.910
or even [UNCLEAR]. Like Namadeva, who was just a tailor; He never went to any university or anything

00:39:04.150 --> 00:39:10.750
and he went to meet another saint called Ghora Kumhar, who was just a kumhar means a potter

00:39:11.170 --> 00:39:16.350
and he was busy making some clay. With his feet he was just trying to

00:39:16.570 --> 00:39:21.810
make some clay ready for his work. When Namadeva went and saw him he said,

00:39:24.470 --> 00:39:30.350
"Nirguna cha bheti alok sa gunati," means, "I came to see the Nirguna, the Nirakara

00:39:30.850 --> 00:39:38.710
and here I see in Saguna." Only a Atmasakshatkari can appreciate another Atmasakshatkari. We cannot, we cannot understand

00:39:39.050 --> 00:39:44.070
because are not yet that [UNCLEAR]. Only a person who has felt this,

00:39:45.270 --> 00:39:52.650
experiences Paramchaitanya, can make out this otherwise you cannot - we are all blind and that's why

00:39:52.950 --> 00:40:00.190
Kabira has said, "Kaise samjhauun sab jag andha." "How can I explain, the whole world is blind," - is a fact.

00:40:01.150 --> 00:40:07.590
That's why they killed so many people, tortured so many people, crucified so many; They couldn't see

00:40:07.910 --> 00:40:15.910
because ignorance and we have to get out of the ignorance to the light, to the Truth and not just to the words - it is beyond that.

00:40:18.530 --> 00:40:26.010
[INAUDIBLE]

00:40:30.330 --> 00:40:35.670
- Kindly teach us the yoga today.
- Yeah, yeah She's going to tell you.

00:40:36.030 --> 00:40:39.710
- Annh?
- Realization, whether You'll teach
- Very nice, please sit.

00:40:40.210 --> 00:40:47.210
This is a real sadhaka, who doesn't discuss, who doesn't argue, nothing; He wants his realization. That is the sign of a sadhaka

00:40:47.550 --> 00:40:54.530
otherwise you go on shifting from one to another all your thoughts. It [UNCLEAR] thoughts, you have to go beyond thought

00:40:54.970 --> 00:41:01.450
to experience and it's for your benevolence, for the benevolence of the whole world and one must experience it.

00:41:02.590 --> 00:41:08.470
So many people have written so many things, so many people have gone [UNCLEAR]. There have been five hundred

00:41:08.770 --> 00:41:12.750
Gitas - what we understand Gita is very different.

00:41:12.990 --> 00:41:18.750
From the way other people understand, is absolutely absurd; Somethings are so absurd

00:41:18.970 --> 00:41:22.990
that surprisingly how people do not see what Krishna must have meant.

00:41:23.350 --> 00:41:30.570
It's very surprising. So for that, your inner eyes have to be opened, your inner understanding has to be open,

00:41:31.050 --> 00:41:35.850
your brain has to receive it's excellence, in understanding.

00:41:36.530 --> 00:41:42.390
The excellence is only possible if your Kundalini rises, otherwise not possible.

00:41:44.730 --> 00:41:52.150
You have spoken of the experience. The experience that we undergo in three states is very different that is the common experience of everyone,

00:41:52.390 --> 00:41:59.410
all the audience here, so [UNCLEAR] a deep state. In deep state what happens we do not know.

00:41:59.610 --> 00:42:05.050
Only in the morning when we will get up we will recognize what is the thing that has happened - we will be under the bliss.

00:42:05.430 --> 00:42:11.050
So, in the two states, the former two states, we will be in the state of [UNCLEAR - PLURALITY?] all this

00:42:11.330 --> 00:42:16.630
so, that is the Saguna function. Nirguna function is only in the deep sleep state.

00:42:16.810 --> 00:42:21.850
Even then in that Avidya function we never come, so.

00:42:21.910 --> 00:42:28.210
But this is all Avidya. What you're talking is real Avidya, I'm talking about Vidya - alright? Sit down.

00:42:28.390 --> 00:42:33.690
So, I'll give you the Vidya, that's the point. You must ask for Vidya and not Avidya.

00:42:33.890 --> 00:42:40.470
"Surdas ki sabhi avidya dur karo Nandlal," Surdas said this after writing the whole of Sursagar.

00:42:43.730 --> 00:42:46.770
This is the situation [UNCLEAR]

00:42:48.590 --> 00:42:54.870
But if I'm saying so, why not accept, why not accept. Supposing I say, "There's a diamond here

00:42:55.270 --> 00:43:00.890
absolutely free available to you." Will you stop coming to that? Even from Australia you will fly out

00:43:01.410 --> 00:43:06.450
but if I'm saying, it is available to you, why not have it? I mean, I can't understand.

00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:17.390
I know it is fantastic. It looks something you cannot imagine

00:43:17.690 --> 00:43:21.950
but is all predicted, is all predicted - it has to happen.

00:43:28.090 --> 00:43:35.070
This is in Kaliyuga only you [UNCLEAR]. This is the time when people are in bhranti,

00:43:35.530 --> 00:43:39.250
in illusion. This is the time it is going to happen; Is all predicted.

00:43:39.930 --> 00:43:44.390
If you have read Nal Damyanti aakhyaan, once Kala was caught by

00:43:44.770 --> 00:43:51.310
Nala by the curse of the Kali and he was so angry with Kali because he had to give up his wife and all that,

00:43:51.830 --> 00:43:56.850
so he caught hold of, one day, Kali and asked him that,

00:43:57.090 --> 00:44:03.930
"It's better that I kill you so that you do not put people into illusions and trouble them." So, Kali said, "Alright,

00:44:04.230 --> 00:44:10.130
if you want to kill, you can kill me but you listen to my mahatma, my importance - what is my importance."

00:44:10.810 --> 00:44:17.230
Said, "What is your importance?" He said, "Those people today who are trying to find, in giri, kandaras,

00:44:17.230 --> 00:44:21.670
in the valleys and in the mountains, one day will be born as house-holders

00:44:22.770 --> 00:44:29.070
and at the time when Kaliyuga will come, they will find the reality." But this is just, you can say, the mythology

00:44:29.270 --> 00:44:34.150
but also in Nadi Granth, if you have read, by Bhrigumuni, he has clearly written - even the deities

00:44:34.350 --> 00:44:38.150
are so clearly - there's one gentleman from your

00:44:39.210 --> 00:44:45.350
Bangalore itself, his name was Bhujander, who has transcripted it and brought it to such an [UNCLEAR - UP TO DATE?] thing.

00:44:45.990 --> 00:44:53.930
If you also see William Blake, he has also said the same thing and he has absolutely predicted the whole thing.

00:44:54.150 --> 00:45:02.130
There's one [UNCLEAR] who has talked about it. Even the Rabindranath Tagore has talked about it. So, I mean, if you see to the

00:45:04.010 --> 00:45:10.970
prophecies also it is to be done now and it is done. There are 40 nations who are following sahaja yoga.

00:45:12.330 --> 00:45:17.810
Only unfortunate part is that in Bangalore I have come very late - that's what

00:45:18.050 --> 00:45:24.010
but there are other places like Hyderabad and all that; We have lots of people who are following sahaja yog.

00:45:24.790 --> 00:45:31.030
In Bombay there are 18 centers. There are 14000 people who are following sahaja yoga,

00:45:31.670 --> 00:45:37.230
in Delhi there are 12000 people following, in Noida there are 14000 people following

00:45:37.770 --> 00:45:41.590
so it's not something, something that is not happening

00:45:42.150 --> 00:45:48.790
and they don't have to pay anything, they don't have to spend any money - little time has to be given - that's all.

00:45:49.010 --> 00:45:55.790
About five minutes in the morning and ten minutes in the evening and you establish yourself. It has to be, it has to be sahaja

00:45:55.950 --> 00:46:00.930
otherwise in these modern times when we have not time for anything how is it going to work out

00:46:01.270 --> 00:46:04.730
And it has to work out in modern times, so how do you work it out?

00:46:09.130 --> 00:46:15.210
You must see if it works out or not. If it does not, you must come to the center it will work out.

00:46:15.590 --> 00:46:20.710
So please, understand that it is for your benevolence. I don't need sahaja yoga,

00:46:20.910 --> 00:46:28.330
you need sahaja yoga. I've come all the way from England to give you sahaja yoga. So now, if you could understand

00:46:28.670 --> 00:46:35.370
what is sahaja yoga is, it's for your benevolence, it's for your good - so why don't do it?

00:46:48.970 --> 00:46:53.690
As a Mother I would say, "I've done the cooking for you." If you're hungry, you say, "Alright, Mother, let me have it."

00:46:54.050 --> 00:47:01.310
But if you're not hungry, you'll ask Me, "From where did You get this, from where did You buy that, what did You get this, what did You..," but if you're hungry, "Alright, let me have it."

00:47:02.650 --> 00:47:09.090
So the, all the audience is not of the same kind because they asked Me, "How do you get it?" - that's the point.

00:47:13.050 --> 00:47:20.610
- Mother, as I understood [UNCLEAR]
- Come little forward

00:47:22.750 --> 00:47:30.030
Mother, as I understood, the Kundalini shakti, the Grace by our meditation.

00:47:31.250 --> 00:47:38.170
Now while we are doing this meditationing to raise the Kundalini Shakti, what is the purpose of this Kundalini they are raising it

00:47:38.470 --> 00:47:44.630
to clean our karma. When the Kundalini shakti rises from the Mooladhara,

00:47:44.810 --> 00:47:49.830
when it comes to the various chakras, it cleanses the karmas in those chakras

00:47:50.170 --> 00:47:57.050
How does it clean? - like a car wiper going up and down, it cleans. It comes forward that is said to reach

00:47:57.270 --> 00:48:01.950
the Sahastrara or whatever maybe. Now Mother, I ask you, whether

00:48:02.130 --> 00:48:06.270
by stopping meditating for some days will it come down to Mooladhara?

00:48:06.510 --> 00:48:13.590
- [Shri Mataji Laughs] Don't be so much. Listen, don't be so much worried.
- No, my point is
- You see, what I am trying to say

00:48:14.590 --> 00:48:21.530
Just now let Me raise your Kundalini - alright. It won't come down normally but if you are a sick person,

00:48:21.830 --> 00:48:28.250
- it has to attend and get there - you're sick there - you're not sick.
- Mother, my point was

00:48:28.550 --> 00:48:36.570
the Kundalini rises and cleans a certain portion. Now [UNCLEAR] up to the Mooladhara

00:48:37.090 --> 00:48:41.670
It has cleaned all the other chakras. I fall sick for one month

00:48:41.890 --> 00:48:46.130
- then... No...
- Will it come down. It has already cleaned

00:48:46.310 --> 00:48:51.190
- Then it will not.
- My second point is
- Hunh
- How I need for our

00:48:51.390 --> 00:48:59.190
sakshatkar, Atmasakshatkar but we might find Atmadarshan. Now Atmadarshan will come only when all our karmas are clean.

00:48:59.570 --> 00:49:07.510
Yeah. So, I tell you what is this that we call it the sprouting of the Kundalini is the beginning of Atmasakshatkar -

00:49:08.410 --> 00:49:15.430
is the beginning. A small light comes in, you see and then gradually it grows and grows and then you

00:49:15.670 --> 00:49:19.030
you get into a state, which we call as Nirvikalpa samadhi.

00:49:19.230 --> 00:49:25.810
If you want you can call at that time Atmasakshatkara. It's no question of simply fighting with the words. No need to fight with the words.

00:49:26.030 --> 00:49:31.910
Why say Atmasakshatkara, because in the beginning the light that comes to you is also for your Atmasakshatkar

00:49:32.130 --> 00:49:38.210
so the sakshatkar starts. You see, if you should see Me from a distance or you see from here, it's the same.

00:49:38.530 --> 00:49:41.890
Once you come closer, you see Me clearly - that's all

00:49:42.470 --> 00:49:48.230
but to say that it is Atmasakshatkara, doesn't mean that it is a full fledged happening.

00:49:48.470 --> 00:49:54.630
I understood it. The Atmasakshatkara is seeing your Atma in front of you.

00:49:55.010 --> 00:50:02.910
achcha. Now what is the Atma? The same as Parbrahma. So, seeing Parbrahma in front of you is just seeing your Atma.

00:50:03.250 --> 00:50:10.590
- Now what do You mean by ...
- You don't see your Atma. If you see something, then you are not that. If you see the light, then you are not the light but you become that.

00:50:10.910 --> 00:50:18.130
Your Atma comes, the light of the Atma comes in your wisdom, which I will tell you tomorrow what happens in Atmasakshatkar

00:50:18.350 --> 00:50:25.830
- but it is the beginning of Atmasakshatkar.
- Now next point is, we must spend most time, most of our time, precious time in meditation

00:50:26.210 --> 00:50:33.930
- so we should not spend our time in the rituals like homa or going to the temple etc. Am I correct?
- Yes.

00:50:39.130 --> 00:50:44.070
You see, once you enter in the hall, whether you are there or here, you are entered in the hall.

00:50:44.410 --> 00:50:51.930
Alright. When you come closer in the front, you have a better view - that's different but once you've entered in the hall you are entered in the hall.

00:50:52.730 --> 00:50:58.890
If you have jumped in the sea, you have jumped in the sea - alright? But how far you have gone with it, is a different point.

00:51:12.730 --> 00:51:19.770
So now, I think, we can have the realization of oneself.

00:51:21.690 --> 00:51:27.550
To begin with the Atmasakshatkara, which is the Kundalini awakening within us,

00:51:28.190 --> 00:51:33.730
for that I have to make humble things to you that

00:51:34.910 --> 00:51:42.550
you should also know what are the centers you have to cater and how to awaken those centers yourself.

00:51:43.350 --> 00:51:50.350
So, it's very simple, it is a very simple method which I'll tell you. So also you can raise your own Kundalini in My presence

00:51:50.590 --> 00:51:57.970
plus you will also know which are the centers you have to look after; It's very, very simple thing you have to do.

00:51:59.310 --> 00:52:05.950
Nothing strenuous or in any way difficult - it's very simple. So, as I told you,

00:52:06.530 --> 00:52:11.590
please you have to take the help of the Mother Earth, so you can take out your shoes - will help you a lot.

00:52:11.790 --> 00:52:16.250
Just take off your shoes to touch the Mother Earth because She takes away most of our problems.

00:52:17.410 --> 00:52:21.230
And take out the chappals and shoes and just put it like this.

00:52:22.650 --> 00:52:30.350
So, best it would be that sit on the ground. If you have to sit cross-legged better to sit on the ground, just in front or put your both the legs.

00:52:30.510 --> 00:52:36.390
Surprisingly, you are sitting already as people get realization; It's the blessings of the modern sahaja yoga.

00:52:43.910 --> 00:52:50.070
Can you move forward some of you people? Better move forward - there's space - so man seats.

00:53:12.330 --> 00:53:18.810
I wanted to a question to you all. While doing this, sometimes the mind just jumps out.

00:53:19.050 --> 00:53:21.990
So, it's better now to quieten your mind.

00:53:24.010 --> 00:53:29.630
Now, Kundalini is the power of Pure Desire. As you know,

00:53:30.690 --> 00:53:37.790
Economics says that, "Desires cannot be satisfied - not satiable in general."

00:53:39.050 --> 00:53:45.090
From one desire to another you try. So that means these desires that we have are not pure.

00:53:45.510 --> 00:53:53.210
There's only one Pure Desire and the Pure Desire is, whether you know about it or not, whether you're conscious or unconscious about it,

00:53:53.590 --> 00:54:00.910
is to be one with the Divine. Unless and until that happens, you can never be satisfied with whatever you might have.

00:54:02.910 --> 00:54:07.210
So now, you have to put your left hand towards Me - it is symbolic;

00:54:07.910 --> 00:54:14.490
This is very symbolic, saying, that you want your realization - this is a desire,

00:54:15.590 --> 00:54:20.730
this is the desire, not pure desire, the desire that you want your Self-realization.

00:54:21.390 --> 00:54:25.630
The another hand, as I told you, is the kriya, is the kriya shakti.

00:54:26.010 --> 00:54:31.930
So, we have to use it to give confidence - with our confidence to nourish ourselves,

00:54:33.510 --> 00:54:39.910
to nourish our centers on the left hand side - it is very simple. So, first you have to know that the

00:54:41.570 --> 00:54:47.270
Spirit resides in our heart, so put our hand on the heart.

00:54:49.450 --> 00:54:53.230
The peetha of the Spirit is here, on the fontanel - peetha,

00:54:53.430 --> 00:54:58.170
is the seat but the Spirit actually resides here in human-beings, in the heart.

00:54:59.890 --> 00:55:06.630
Now, you must know that you are the Spirit - that's true

00:55:07.950 --> 00:55:15.190
but if you are the Spirit, also you are your master, your guru because your Spirit guides you.

00:55:16.530 --> 00:55:24.510
So, then you put your right hand - we've got to work on the left hand side - on the upper portion of your abdomen, on the left hand side.

00:55:26.530 --> 00:55:31.630
This is the center of our guru principle, guru tatwa, left hand side.

00:55:33.850 --> 00:55:40.450
upper portion of your abdomen, over here,  upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side.

00:55:40.910 --> 00:55:47.390
Now, this is the principle of your mastery. This is

00:55:48.010 --> 00:55:53.870
been created by great saints and great masters  - satgurus.

00:55:55.010 --> 00:56:01.130
Then, you have to put your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen

00:56:03.110 --> 00:56:08.210
which is the center of Shudh Vidya, of Pure Knowledge.

00:56:08.810 --> 00:56:16.650
Now, this Shudh Vidya, pure knowledge manifests through your Central Nervous System. You become

00:56:20.490 --> 00:56:26.270
conscious of it, know through your awareness, work through your Central Nervous System.

00:56:27.710 --> 00:56:32.610
Then, you have to again raise your hand in the upper portion of your abdomen, on the left hand side.

00:56:33.510 --> 00:56:37.730
Then, you have to raise your right hand on your heart.

00:56:40.290 --> 00:56:47.390
Now, you have to raise your right hand in the corner of your neck and  your shoulder and turn your head to your right.

00:56:47.950 --> 00:56:51.310
Now, this is the center which is called a [UNCLEAR] guilt

00:56:51.790 --> 00:56:58.210
when people say [UNCLEAR]. You forget the past - you have to forgive yourself,

00:56:58.570 --> 00:57:05.070
forgive yourself absolutely. Turn your head to your right. Now, you have to

00:57:05.450 --> 00:57:13.050
put your hand on your forehead across and press it on both the sides and put down your head.

00:57:13.890 --> 00:57:20.770
You have to press it hard on both the sides. This is a center where you have to forgive everyone.

00:57:23.450 --> 00:57:29.290
Now, you have to take this hand on the back-side of your head and push back your head,

00:57:30.050 --> 00:57:36.730
look upward and here is the center where you have to ask for forgiveness

00:57:37.090 --> 00:57:44.330
from the All-Pervading Power but you're not to feel guilty, you're not to count your mistakes.

00:57:45.110 --> 00:57:51.710
Then you have to stretch your hand and put the center of your palm on top of this

00:57:52.290 --> 00:57:57.650
fontanel bone area, which is taalu, which was a soft bone in your childhood, press

00:57:59.030 --> 00:58:06.290
properly you put it there and push back your fingers, push back your fingers and press it hard.

00:58:07.610 --> 00:58:14.450
Press it hard. Now you have to move your scalp seven times, clockwise,

00:58:15.010 --> 00:58:20.490
slowly, clockwise, don't move your hand but move your scalp.

00:58:21.950 --> 00:58:27.750
Vibrations through the scalp, push back your fingers - this is important - seven times

00:58:28.110 --> 00:58:33.150
because there're seven seats of these seven centers in our brain.

00:58:49.370 --> 00:58:56.170
Now, that's all we have to do. Now we have to close the eyes. Before closing the eyes,

00:58:56.550 --> 00:59:01.930
I've to tell you again and again, that we have to be pleasantly placed towards ourselves.

00:59:02.190 --> 00:59:09.470
We have to be prasanna because we have to enter into the Kingdom of God and we should not blame ourselves for anything,

00:59:09.950 --> 00:59:17.010
we should not be sorry for anything but in the present you're sitting here

00:59:17.270 --> 00:59:23.010
about to enter into the Kingdom of God, so you have to be very pleasantly placed towards yourself,

00:59:23.370 --> 00:59:30.250
not  to feel guilty, not feel any way, feel diffident; Every person is capable of getting realization.

00:59:30.470 --> 00:59:38.250
Some people may not get today but [UNCLEAR] if they come to the center, all of them will get and you all can get your Kundalini

00:59:39.210 --> 00:59:43.070
properly fixed with Atmasakshatkar - no doubt about it.

00:59:43.290 --> 00:59:48.790
It has worked in thousands of people, so why not it will work in you also.

00:59:50.970 --> 00:59:57.850
So, if you have anything black thread or anything tied or something like tight on your waist

00:59:58.090 --> 01:00:04.370
or tight on your neck, you can little bit loosen it or if there are any malas or anything - of course, mangalsutra you can have.

01:00:04.530 --> 01:00:10.110
Rest of it, any malas of, say, Rudraksha or anything like that, please take it off - that's all.

01:00:13.030 --> 01:00:16.750
Now, put the left hand towards Me. Firstly, you should be comfortable

01:00:16.990 --> 01:00:22.830
and sit in a way that is not slouching, neither very straight but in a simple manner.

01:00:32.870 --> 01:00:37.290
Put your left hand towards Me and the right hand

01:00:38.490 --> 01:00:41.750
you have to put it on your heart. Now please, close your eyes.

01:00:50.250 --> 01:00:58.010
[Hindi - Baat suno] Listen to Me. [INAUDIBLE]

01:01:00.590 --> 01:01:06.970
[INAUDIBLE]

01:01:09.210 --> 01:01:16.170
Now, please close your eyes and unless and until I'll tell you, please don't open your eyes

01:01:17.090 --> 01:01:22.190
because your attention has to be inside that's why please don't open your eyes.

01:01:27.010 --> 01:01:34.510
Here, you have to ask Me a question -

01:01:35.810 --> 01:01:41.590
as we ask a computer we have to ask a question -

01:01:42.230 --> 01:01:45.910
very important question - you can call Me Mother

01:01:46.590 --> 01:01:52.270
or you can call Me Shri Mataji.

01:01:53.870 --> 01:02:00.170
"Mother, am I the Spirit?" Ask this question, three times, in your heart.

01:02:00.530 --> 01:02:05.670
Ask this question, three times, in your heart, "Mother am I the Spirit?"

01:02:26.630 --> 01:02:31.190
Ask this question three times. [ASIDE - Just a minute, hello.]

01:02:33.290 --> 01:02:40.510
[INAUDIBLE]

01:02:43.050 --> 01:02:51.010
[INAUDIBLE CONVERSATION] sit in the front. Go and see what's the matter.

01:02:53.350 --> 01:02:59.030
Now, if you are the Spirit, if you are the Spirit

01:03:01.090 --> 01:03:07.870
then, you are your master also, you are your guru.

01:03:08.370 --> 01:03:13.550
Now take down your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side

01:03:13.770 --> 01:03:17.190
and press it hard on your stomach, left hand side.

01:03:17.950 --> 01:03:22.930
Press it hard and here, you ask Me a question, "Mother,

01:03:25.410 --> 01:03:30.830
am I my own guru, Mother, am I my own master?"

01:03:31.030 --> 01:03:36.630
Ask this question three times. Please put your both feet apart from each other [UNCLEAR]

01:03:37.150 --> 01:03:42.570
We should not be [UNCLEAR], please put them apart. Ask this question now, "Mother,

01:03:43.250 --> 01:03:49.550
am I my own master, Mother, am I my own guru?" ask this question three times.

01:04:22.070 --> 01:04:24.990
Now, I respect your freedom.

01:04:27.190 --> 01:04:33.310
The Shudh Vidya or the Pure Knowledge cannot be given to you

01:04:34.810 --> 01:04:41.230
unless and until you want in your own freedom - I respect it, so

01:04:43.450 --> 01:04:47.490
now, put your hand in the lower portion of your abdomen

01:04:50.150 --> 01:04:57.850
and ask by saying, "Mother, please give me Pure Knowledge."

01:04:58.050 --> 01:05:04.490
Please say it six times. Six times you should say. You should say it six times.

01:05:09.570 --> 01:05:16.190
"Mother, please give me Pure Knowledge."

01:05:17.190 --> 01:05:21.890
Six times because this center has got six petals.

01:05:37.390 --> 01:05:42.450
As soon as you say that, your Kundalini starts moving upward.

01:05:42.650 --> 01:05:47.710
Now we have to nourish the upper centers with our confidence.

01:05:52.110 --> 01:05:59.410
Don't doubt, keep your mind open, keep your heart open, don't doubt, otherwise Kundalini will not rise.

01:06:06.270 --> 01:06:12.510
Now, raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side

01:06:13.410 --> 01:06:19.330
Here, with full confidence, you have to say

01:06:21.390 --> 01:06:25.690
ten times, "Mother,

01:06:26.730 --> 01:06:34.110
I am my own guru, Mother, I am My own master," this is the [UNCLEAR - PROPHECY?] you are talking about.

01:06:41.010 --> 01:06:47.410
I've told you at the very outset, that the greatest Truth is

01:06:48.390 --> 01:06:55.290
that you are the Spirit. You are not this body, you are not this mind,

01:06:55.970 --> 01:07:01.850
you are not this ego, you are not these emotions but you are Pure Spirit.

01:07:05.230 --> 01:07:11.230
So now, raise your right hand on your heart and here,

01:07:11.950 --> 01:07:17.070
with full confidence, you have to say,

01:07:21.770 --> 01:07:28.950
twelve times, "Mother, I am the Spirit."

01:07:30.750 --> 01:07:34.130
"Mother, I am the Spirit," please say it twelve times.

01:07:56.870 --> 01:08:03.570
We have to know that this All-Pervading Power is the

01:08:03.850 --> 01:08:10.590
ocean of love, of bliss and of joy.

01:08:12.430 --> 01:08:17.070
It's the ocean of knowledge but above all

01:08:18.230 --> 01:08:24.270
it is the ocean of forgiveness, so whatever mistakes we commit

01:08:24.690 --> 01:08:32.590
or whatever, so called, sins we commit, can be easily dissolved by the power of this ocean of forgiveness.

01:08:34.250 --> 01:08:41.970
So, please forgive yourselves. Now, with full confidence, put your right hand

01:08:42.310 --> 01:08:48.890
in the corner of your neck and your shoulder and turn round your head towards the right.

01:08:49.630 --> 01:08:54.570
Here you have to say, again with full confidence, three times

01:08:55.530 --> 01:08:59.230
"Mother, I am not guilty at all," please say this.

01:09:00.010 --> 01:09:05.670
"Mother, I am not guilty at all, " please say it - this is the worst center we have

01:09:06.310 --> 01:09:11.970
and this all the kinds of problems like spondylitis, like angina.

01:09:28.310 --> 01:09:32.730
Now, we have to forgive everyone.

01:09:33.730 --> 01:09:38.650
You might say that it's not easy to forgive

01:09:40.070 --> 01:09:46.530
but whether you forgive or don't forgive, you don't do anything - it's a myth - and when you don't forgive,

01:09:47.130 --> 01:09:52.370
you play into wrong hands. So now, you raise your hand

01:09:53.070 --> 01:09:58.010
and put it on your forehead across and

01:09:59.490 --> 01:10:03.990
put down your head, as much as you can and press it hard.

01:10:07.210 --> 01:10:12.750
Here you have to say, without [UNCLEAR - ASKING?] whom you have to forgive

01:10:13.030 --> 01:10:20.750
or for what you have to forgive, you just - not how many times but from your heart,

01:10:21.630 --> 01:10:27.810
"Mother, I forgive everyone." It's a very powerful center here

01:10:28.070 --> 01:10:31.390
Get rid of all the [UNCLEAR - FANTASTICAL?] ideas.

01:10:45.750 --> 01:10:50.530
Now, take back your hand on the back side of your head

01:10:51.190 --> 01:10:55.590
and push back your head, as much as you can, on that line.

01:10:56.510 --> 01:11:02.210
Here, without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes and things,

01:11:02.970 --> 01:11:06.970
just for your own satisfaction you have to say,

01:11:10.490 --> 01:11:15.530
"O Paramchaitanya, O All-Pervading Power of love

01:11:17.090 --> 01:11:21.950
please forgive me if knowingly or unknowingly I've said something

01:11:22.150 --> 01:11:26.950
or I've done something which is wrong." Just say it from your heart again

01:11:28.310 --> 01:11:33.330
but don't count your mistakes, don't feel guilty.

01:11:42.650 --> 01:11:45.690
Now, stretch your hand

01:11:49.250 --> 01:11:56.510
and put the center of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area

01:11:56.930 --> 01:12:02.870
which was a soft bone in your childhood - it is called as taalu. Now,

01:12:03.810 --> 01:12:08.630
put down your head as much as you can, press it hard

01:12:08.930 --> 01:12:15.850
[UNCLEAR] and push back your fingers. Now, you must know

01:12:16.830 --> 01:12:24.710
[UNCLEAR] I cannot give you Self-realization, unless and until you want it

01:12:25.050 --> 01:12:31.930
in your freedom, as this freedom as this freedom has to be respected for you to get the ultimate freedom.

01:12:32.830 --> 01:12:38.710
So, you move your hand seven times clockwise saying ten times,

01:12:39.810 --> 01:12:47.390
"Mother, please give me my Self-realization." Just say it seven times moving your scalp.

01:12:49.650 --> 01:12:53.250
[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE]

01:12:54.270 --> 01:12:57.610
[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE]

01:12:59.050 --> 01:13:02.710
[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE]

01:13:03.970 --> 01:13:07.830
[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE]

01:13:09.390 --> 01:13:13.190
[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE]

01:13:14.050 --> 01:13:18.190
[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE]

01:13:19.090 --> 01:13:22.490
[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE]

01:13:24.950 --> 01:13:29.550
Now, please take down your hands. Open your eyes.

01:13:33.490 --> 01:13:38.790
Put your right hand towards Me, like this and bend your head

01:13:39.730 --> 01:13:45.770
and see for yourself if there's a cool breeze coming out of your scalp but don't touch it -

01:13:46.010 --> 01:13:53.790
keep it away from it and see for yourself. It is you who has to certify; Nobody else is going to certify.

01:13:55.410 --> 01:14:03.410
Just see if there's a cool breeze coming out. Some people might get some heat - doesn't matter. After sometime it will cool down. See for yourself.

01:14:08.350 --> 01:14:15.990
Put your left hand towards Me and now again put down your head and see with your right hand.

01:14:16.210 --> 01:14:22.210
Some people get it quite far it's like this. They just [UNCLEAR]

01:14:22.410 --> 01:14:27.410
but start getting cool breeze slowly emitting from this.

01:14:33.390 --> 01:14:38.990
We have no fans, nothing , so not to doubt. Now, again put your right hand

01:14:39.550 --> 01:14:46.790
and again put your head down and see for yourself if there's a cool breeze coming out of your head.

01:14:52.830 --> 01:15:00.830
Now, raise your both hands and ask a question, "Is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?"

01:15:01.790 --> 01:15:06.310
"Is this the cool breeze of the All-Pervading Power?"

01:15:06.790 --> 01:15:10.150
" Is this the cool breeze of Param Chaitanya?"

01:15:11.590 --> 01:15:17.470
Just ask these questions, any one of them, three times, looking upwards.

01:15:22.970 --> 01:15:30.450
Now, take down your hands. Now, watch Me without thinking [UNCLEAR - IF YOU CAN DO IT?]

01:15:40.510 --> 01:15:48.110
Now, those who have felt the cool breeze in their hands or out of their fontanel bone area, please raise both your hands.

01:15:55.270 --> 01:15:58.570
So nice to see. This is the experience!

01:16:00.110 --> 01:16:07.770
Now, how to work it out? What is this Power? You have to come to our center.

01:16:08.410 --> 01:16:13.090
In any case  you come tomorrow.Those who haven't felt, you have to feel tomorrow.

01:16:14.850 --> 01:16:22.610
All of you will feel it and I'll tell you clearly what is this Power and how it works.

01:16:23.710 --> 01:16:29.130
May God bless you! Now don't discuss about it, don't talk about it -

01:16:29.710 --> 01:16:36.230
just give time because time you have felt enjoy it.
