00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:01.420
[missing start]

00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:04.780
very anxious that Sahaja Yoga should be established.

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:08.210
And the fourth thing he said that
there is going to be anniversary,

00:00:08.217 --> 00:00:10.717
some fourth anniversary or something, of the U.N.

00:00:10.717 --> 00:00:13.950
And the gentleman who is in charge is that Muller fellow,

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.280
who is already suffering from something,

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.670
and he will definitely need My help.

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:24.960
And he said that they, they are
going to have a spiritual dimension

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.050
to their celebration,

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.660
in which he wants Me to come
and give a lecture to them.

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:32.540
And also he said I should go to UNESCO

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.230
and give a lecture there

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.390
and also I should go to Senegal to give a
lecture there and to establish Sahaja Yoga.

00:00:39.401 --> 00:00:41.005
Though he is a Muslim,

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:42.829
he believes in Sahaja Yoga very ardently.

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:45.329
So all good things have come out of him.

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.469
And this gentleman, Mr. Angel, whom I’ve met yesterday

00:00:49.467 --> 00:00:54.559
was very positive and he said
he will try to get also a..

00:00:54.585 --> 00:00:58.838
our Rustom here, with whom he will discuss
and other Indians will be discussed

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.608
and we’ll be able to find out something very positive,

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:06.468
because he got a tremendous
experience of realisation yesterday,

00:01:06.488 --> 00:01:11.338
that he felt the cool breeze and all
that and he is a man of great learning.

00:01:11.338 --> 00:01:17.808
And I was very happy that he got
this realization and he was so good.

00:01:17.828 --> 00:01:26.126
So it seems that we are now about to take
a big leap into a new type of people,

00:01:26.126 --> 00:01:34.402
who will bring Sahaja Yoga to a much wider
level and that is going to help all of us.

00:01:34.421 --> 00:01:42.441
At the same time I have to tell you, that we all Sahaja Yogis have to understand certain things, which are very important.

00:01:42.464 --> 00:01:47.385
Of course, I was very much pleased with the
way you had done this thing and all that.

00:01:47.405 --> 00:01:48.295
It’s very good.

00:01:48.311 --> 00:01:52.165
But certain things must be understood very clearly.

00:01:52.205 --> 00:01:54.705
And one of them was that some people,

00:01:54.705 --> 00:01:56.645
of course, come to complain to Me also.

00:01:56.645 --> 00:02:01.095
You must know that, that they said that
the charges were rather too much for them,

00:02:01.118 --> 00:02:06.940
for this programme and that the food was not sufficient

00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:10.470
and some of them didn’t get sufficient food.

00:02:10.498 --> 00:02:12.120
All right, whatever it is.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:19.861
so from next time we have to remember that we must keep charges little lower, try to give sufficient food.

00:02:19.861 --> 00:02:22.361
Then I discovered that I was rather angry

00:02:22.361 --> 00:02:27.301
with Christine and I told her that, “How
is it that the food was not sufficient?”

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.880
Then she said it was a caterer. But you
don’t have caterers; that's not proper.

00:02:31.891 --> 00:02:34.690
We shouldn’t have in Sahaja
Yoga any caterers or anything.

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.040
There are Sahaja Yogis; they should cook.

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.260
That’s the best way. There are so many of us

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.314
and we should not arrange with the
caterers because the caterers are,

00:02:43.314 --> 00:02:49.744
you know, they make their own profits and they are not bothered whether everybody has got food or not.

00:02:49.743 --> 00:02:53.114
So that should not happen. Next
time we should have a more...

00:02:53.137 --> 00:02:55.527
I mean, actually I could have cooked for you.

00:02:55.557 --> 00:03:02.927
I’m very good at cooking Myself, but I didn’t know there was a caterer or anything.

00:03:02.928 --> 00:03:09.107
So, this is what one has to see to it, that you should arrange things in such a way.

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:17.460
And then another thing I have decided tomorrow to open an account in My name, in one of the banks here.

00:03:17.487 --> 00:03:22.450
And so that those who have to send
money for next year’s programme

00:03:22.472 --> 00:03:25.851
should send it there directly, or
they can send it to Christine,

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:31.359
and Christine has to send all that and keep
a receipt of that and she has to tell Me.

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:33.531
This is very important; one must understand.

00:03:33.531 --> 00:03:38.666
Secondly, I would say that you all should
have all the accounts properly written down.

00:03:38.666 --> 00:03:41.801
That is one of the most
important things in Sahaja Yoga.

00:03:41.814 --> 00:03:44.521
When I asked Christine, “What
about the accounts and all that?”

00:03:44.521 --> 00:03:47.971
She said that there isn’t any
system like that existing.

00:03:47.991 --> 00:03:50.331
I said, “That’s something surprising.”

00:03:50.331 --> 00:03:57.021
Because in London, though whatever it is, you know
that very well, every penny is accounted for.

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:03.614
Even I am so meticulous about it, that if I
borrow even twenty p from you or anything,

00:04:03.614 --> 00:04:06.114
I return it, see to it, because it haunts Me.

00:04:06.114 --> 00:04:09.919
And in the same way I think the
accounting is very important.

00:04:09.923 --> 00:04:14.930
One of the reasons why you suffer from money,
may be, that the accounts are not there.

00:04:14.956 --> 00:04:23.350
Must keep accounts, because I may not see the accounts,
but I may just have a glance at it and look at it.

00:04:23.385 --> 00:04:29.070
Actually, I would like to know what sort of
money is coming and what sort of money is going.

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:32.445
It’s important. Is the Lakshmi
tattwa, which you must look after.

00:04:32.445 --> 00:04:36.725
It’s very important. It’s extremely
important. So next time when I come,

00:04:36.748 --> 00:04:39.964
anything you do, you must have proper accounts.

00:04:39.988 --> 00:04:42.488
And just to show Me. That’s all.

00:04:42.488 --> 00:04:46.848
I am not going to deal with it, but I must
just see. My glances must be on that,

00:04:46.875 --> 00:04:50.878
so that if there is any problem
of the money it can be solved.

00:04:52.313 --> 00:04:56.175
Like, we did, in North America
was a big mess, I must say.

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:02.175
Last time. It was a very, very big mess,
and the whole thing took so much of money

00:05:02.216 --> 00:05:07.506
and the way it was wasted, er, we must,
because there was no accounting system.

00:05:07.506 --> 00:05:14.456
If Patrick was to be put to the account system that, “We have to give account to Mother of every pie and everything that is important.”

00:05:14.456 --> 00:05:16.762
There he could not have run
away with all that money.

00:05:16.762 --> 00:05:21.436
And despite that, he was a banker, because he didn’t
know where he was spending, what he was doing.

00:05:21.468 --> 00:05:27.166
And if you don’t keep that kind of an accounting, saying that, “This is Mother’s accounts,” you see, what will happen?

00:05:27.166 --> 00:05:30.256
Money will slip out. You’ll over-spend money.

00:05:30.269 --> 00:05:32.356
That’s what exactly happened last time.

00:05:32.356 --> 00:05:35.396
And this time I don’t want it to be repeated.

00:05:35.436 --> 00:05:37.936
This is God’s money; this is His work.

00:05:37.936 --> 00:05:42.306
And we have to be very careful
with every paisa that we have.

00:05:42.321 --> 00:05:44.821
This is a very important thing
which people don’t understand,

00:05:44.821 --> 00:05:49.496
and I was amazed when Christine told Me she has
no accounts of things and amazed how is it.

00:05:49.505 --> 00:05:53.044
She is the leader of New York
and she should have kept it.

00:05:53.032 --> 00:05:56.624
And I’m really sorry that she
had no accounts of anything.

00:05:56.626 --> 00:05:58.784
It really surprised Me.

00:05:58.788 --> 00:06:05.413
How could she do like that? And she knows; she has
lived in London and she knows what is to be done.

00:06:05.428 --> 00:06:09.033
This is another thing, because I must tell you
all these things, because you should not repeat.

00:06:09.036 --> 00:06:12.113
Then another very important
thing I must tell you:

00:06:12.132 --> 00:06:15.902
I felt yesterday while the Puja was on,

00:06:15.902 --> 00:06:22.302
I tried to raise your Kundalini. A terrible catch
of a very worst type on the Heart, Vishuddhi,

00:06:22.324 --> 00:06:27.177
went into the chakra here.

00:06:28.457 --> 00:06:34.147
Now, that means there were some people
who were not fully Sahaja Yogis.

00:06:34.147 --> 00:06:36.989
So, it should never be done.

00:06:37.007 --> 00:06:39.507
Even in France, they did the same thing.

00:06:39.507 --> 00:06:45.469
And I told them, “You shouldn’t get half-hearted
people, just who have come for the Puja.

00:06:45.497 --> 00:06:50.450
If they are friends of somebody or something,
Puja, you have to be very, very cautious.

00:06:50.451 --> 00:06:54.760
Because it gives Me pain.” You don’t want to give
Me pain and don’t want to trouble Me, isn’t it?

00:06:54.793 --> 00:06:58.700
I’ve come here to solve
problems, not to get into these.

00:06:58.727 --> 00:07:02.103
And it was really so painful
yesterday, you have no idea.

00:07:02.125 --> 00:07:04.343
But somehow I managed to take it out.

00:07:04.343 --> 00:07:10.013
So I would tell you, those people
who are not fully realised

00:07:10.013 --> 00:07:12.478
who are not in doubtless awareness,

00:07:12.493 --> 00:07:15.266
you must not have them for Puja.

00:07:15.266 --> 00:07:17.766
It gives Me trouble or they may go off.

00:07:17.766 --> 00:07:22.123
There was one fellow, I told him not to
come in, in France, and he became crazy.

00:07:22.123 --> 00:07:25.493
And then he will go to the jail, he
will go to the people and say

00:07:25.486 --> 00:07:27.986
that, “Because of Kundalini Jagruti I got it.”

00:07:27.986 --> 00:07:31.603
But to see to awaken
Kundalini is not an easy thing.

00:07:31.603 --> 00:07:35.433
And when everybody’s Kundalini is
rising, his Kundalini also may rise

00:07:35.453 --> 00:07:40.038
and may have such a problem that we
cannot solve it. So you be careful.

00:07:40.038 --> 00:07:43.033
First of all, you should be really
very, very strict with people

00:07:43.047 --> 00:07:45.173
that you should say, “You must all become.

00:07:45.173 --> 00:07:47.673
Unless and until you have
become, you cannot come to Puja.”

00:07:47.673 --> 00:07:50.173
And I tell you, this works much better.

00:07:50.173 --> 00:07:53.723
Then everybody tries to be that;

00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:57.043
everybody tries to race themselves.

00:07:57.043 --> 00:07:59.693
That, it’s a competition, sort of
thing, you know, they set into,

00:07:59.693 --> 00:08:02.523
and they say, “We must do this.
Otherwise, how can it be?”

00:08:02.523 --> 00:08:04.223
So they try to improve.

00:08:04.223 --> 00:08:08.423
But if you allow right, lovey-dovey
style, it goes on like that.

00:08:08.423 --> 00:08:14.153
It’s not that. And France, it’s one of them, which
has suffered so much because of this kind of thing.

00:08:14.173 --> 00:08:18.103
And I find in France then the wave
comes up and suddenly it drops down,

00:08:18.103 --> 00:08:22.343
again comes up, goes down, because
there are no solid people there.

00:08:22.363 --> 00:08:26.523
So you have to create really very,
very, very, very solid people.

00:08:26.523 --> 00:08:29.263
That is important, and Puja
is only meant for them.

00:08:29.298 --> 00:08:32.699
Yeah, there may be only five, there
could be only ten; doesn’t matter.

00:08:32.699 --> 00:08:35.876
Not important to have many people for Puja.

00:08:35.909 --> 00:08:38.146
We can have it for programmes. So remember:

00:08:38.179 --> 00:08:41.356
I’m telling you very clearly
anywhere. You want to have a Puja,

00:08:41.356 --> 00:08:46.586
supposing now, say, in, er, San Francisco
or San Diego, you want to have a Puja,

00:08:46.586 --> 00:08:54.006
anything of even of the photograph, then please do not
admit people to come in, who are not realised fully.

00:08:54.006 --> 00:08:57.736
Remember that. Never get them. You’ll have trouble, your children will have trouble,

00:08:57.766 --> 00:09:01.178
your husbands will have trouble
and their bhoots will get into you.

00:09:02.678 --> 00:09:08.198
Because they’ll be so frightened as to face it,
that there could be very serious things happen.

00:09:08.198 --> 00:09:14.664
So remember my words: do not allow people who are
half-hearted, half-baked to come to Sahaja Yoga

00:09:14.664 --> 00:09:19.118
in a way that is in the inner circle.

00:09:20.293 --> 00:09:25.268
Sahaja Yoga has three circles, as you know. One
is the periphery, where people come, go, like that.

00:09:25.295 --> 00:09:28.678
Second circle is where people
come and settling down.

00:09:28.678 --> 00:09:30.498
And third one where they are settled down.

00:09:30.533 --> 00:09:35.463
Only the third one can do the Puja. They only
have the privilege; it’s a special privilege.

00:09:35.463 --> 00:09:37.963
Everybody cannot have that privilege. All right?

00:09:37.963 --> 00:09:41.893
This is one thing, then. Another
thing which really frightened Me was

00:09:41.893 --> 00:09:45.834
the little child here. He
was very badly caught up.

00:09:45.863 --> 00:09:53.354
And now I don’t know why, but I must say
that you must have your vibrations corrected.

00:09:53.354 --> 00:09:55.854
May be something wrong that how
could you not feel the child.

00:09:55.854 --> 00:09:59.854
Means he would have gone mad the way
he was. You don’t know how he was.

00:09:59.869 --> 00:10:02.369
It was very dangerous. It could be with any other child.

00:10:02.369 --> 00:10:07.324
Why I am telling it openly? That it could
be with any other child that can happen.

00:10:07.346 --> 00:10:10.676
So be careful about your children. Be very careful.

00:10:10.704 --> 00:10:14.966
Always feel their vibrations. They,
you see, you are just trustees.

00:10:14.976 --> 00:10:16.826
They are My children.

00:10:16.826 --> 00:10:22.811
I was so amazed, I tell you. And he is so aware,
so intelligent and such a great soul like him.

00:10:22.855 --> 00:10:26.011
And he was suffering within himself, you see.

00:10:26.011 --> 00:10:29.501
Not only him; anyone of them could be
like that, anyone of the children.

00:10:29.501 --> 00:10:31.081
He’s just an example.

00:10:31.081 --> 00:10:36.131
It came to My mind yesterday,
and I was really very much upset,

00:10:36.135 --> 00:10:40.481
very upset, because they
are My children, not yours.

00:10:41.557 --> 00:10:46.177
They are in your trust, and nothing
should happen to My children.

00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:48.477
Otherwise, I’ll take them away.

00:10:48.477 --> 00:10:51.667
You have to look after them.
Keep your vibrations all right.

00:10:51.667 --> 00:10:57.127
Remember that. Never get them. You’ll have
trouble, your children will have trouble,

00:10:57.137 --> 00:11:01.487
See how they are. Look after them. It’s
not the responsibility of one person.

00:11:01.487 --> 00:11:03.987
It’s the responsibility of the whole centre.

00:11:03.987 --> 00:11:07.502
Like, Olympia got lost very much.

00:11:08.488 --> 00:11:10.988
And I was amazed how she got lost so much.

00:11:10.988 --> 00:11:15.348
I went to find out what was the reason,
how this child got into this thing.

00:11:15.348 --> 00:11:19.448
To Olympia, is such a great soul,
and I gave it to Gavin and Jane.

00:11:19.478 --> 00:11:21.368
And why this child is lost?

00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:24.150
Now Jane is gone out there to learn some Sanskrit.

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:29.590
There was one lady who tried to be
over sort of possessive of Olympia.

00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:31.904
She ruined her completely.

00:11:31.904 --> 00:11:36.160
So, but one thing about English is
that they all are joined together.

00:11:36.167 --> 00:11:39.070
All the children are there. They
always see them in the programmes.

00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:43.669
They are all the time there. Even if they are running, jumping or doing anything, even sleeping; doesn’t matter.

00:11:43.669 --> 00:11:45.509
But they bring the children to the programme.

00:11:45.552 --> 00:11:48.052
So the children are checked all the time.

00:11:48.052 --> 00:11:51.189
And they immediately informed Me about this.

00:11:51.199 --> 00:11:55.939
And we have now arranged her to go to
some other place, not with the parents,

00:11:55.957 --> 00:11:59.479
but she will be staying with somebody
else. So there is no more problem.

00:11:59.479 --> 00:12:01.979
You see, you must know it’s very important.

00:12:01.979 --> 00:12:06.109
Because of their grace, we are getting so many things.

00:12:06.139 --> 00:12:12.408
They are great souls God has given us. They are great
saints God has given us. We have to respect them

00:12:12.408 --> 00:12:17.208
We have to allow them to grow in Sahaja Yoga.
They should not be denied any opportunity.

00:12:17.208 --> 00:12:21.018
They should be brought to the
programmes, they should be tested by you.

00:12:21.018 --> 00:12:23.518
They should be looked after. They are in your trust.

00:12:23.518 --> 00:12:27.128
So if something happens, say,
in San Francisco to children,

00:12:27.119 --> 00:12:33.128
I will definitely catch hold of someone in
San Francisco, why it has happened to them.

00:12:33.127 --> 00:12:35.163
All of you are responsible.

00:12:35.163 --> 00:12:37.977
It’s not only Judy, who is responsible for her children,

00:12:38.029 --> 00:12:40.597
but all of you are responsible for these children.

00:12:40.617 --> 00:12:43.657
It’s not only that he is responsible for that child,

00:12:43.656 --> 00:12:46.567
but everybody is responsible for that child.

00:12:46.572 --> 00:12:52.435
So children are a collective
responsibility; this we must understand.

00:12:52.451 --> 00:12:57.655
Otherwise, we’ll be in trouble because
if you do not look after the saints,

00:12:57.661 --> 00:13:01.271
God is not going to be happy with us.

00:13:01.291 --> 00:13:09.441
That is very important for all of you to look after the
children in such a way that’s a collective responsibility.

00:13:09.441 --> 00:13:12.361
Every child must be looked after.

00:13:13.931 --> 00:13:18.771
Moreover, in England, after all,
because I’m there, I’m very alert.

00:13:18.802 --> 00:13:26.692
And sometimes I find it happened even
in Switzerland something like that.

00:13:26.692 --> 00:13:29.192
And I was amazed how one child was so caught up.

00:13:29.192 --> 00:13:33.169
And then we found that the father was
trying to play some tricks with him.

00:13:33.169 --> 00:13:36.252
And now he might go to jail, his father.

00:13:37.934 --> 00:13:42.064
But you see, you should be alert. What I am trying
to say is you should be all alert about it.

00:13:42.075 --> 00:13:45.174
This is your responsibility. This
is your collective responsibility,

00:13:45.189 --> 00:13:51.224
and I would say that I will hold all of you responsible
if something goes wrong with My children. So be careful.

00:13:51.224 --> 00:13:54.653
They cannot suffer. They are not to
suffer. They have to enjoy life.

00:13:54.653 --> 00:13:56.074
They have to be happy children

00:13:56.079 --> 00:14:01.784
and you have to see their needs and things and they
are a collective responsibility all of us have got.

00:14:01.793 --> 00:14:04.514
They are not the children of the
parents; you must understand that.

00:14:04.514 --> 00:14:07.468
They are your children, they are My
children, they are everybody’s children,

00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:09.970
They are people’s children, they are important things.

00:14:09.970 --> 00:14:13.188
Till they are grown up let them be
here, then we’ll arrange their schools.

00:14:13.188 --> 00:14:15.688
We’ll look after them. They are very precious things,

00:14:15.688 --> 00:14:18.368
extremely precious, all right?

00:14:18.997 --> 00:14:24.842
And this is what I would like to tell you
that no child should suffer in My absence.

00:14:24.849 --> 00:14:28.032
I was quite disturbed because
he's such a great thing, Scott,

00:14:28.053 --> 00:14:33.820
he’s such a great thing. First day I came
here I know. I was so happy to meet him.

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:36.340
This is a great personality.

00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:41.862
But they should not suffer, you know. They will get
rid of it, but they’ll have to fight it out too much.

00:14:41.862 --> 00:14:45.621
If you help them, if you are alert, you
should see to whom they are talking,

00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:49.390
what they are doing, where
they are going. Keep a watch.

00:14:49.403 --> 00:14:54.840
Be alert, because everybody is under attack.

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:59.323
All the children are under attack.
All the satanic forces are there.

00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:04.877
You must take them to programmes. That’s one
thing you must do, because there it cleanses out.

00:15:04.891 --> 00:15:08.947
You should not be afraid of taking them to; even
if they sleep off or anything, doesn’t matter.

00:15:08.947 --> 00:15:12.987
Take them in sleeping conditions;
doesn’t matter. It’s all right.

00:15:12.987 --> 00:15:17.817
But they should be there. It works out.
They should be kept always very alert.

00:15:17.833 --> 00:15:23.237
Then the last thing that I have to tell you,
that all of you must clear out your vibrations.

00:15:23.252 --> 00:15:25.547
You all should become really sensitive.

00:15:25.547 --> 00:15:32.889
You should be able to see how much you have improved
in your sensitivity. That’s very important.

00:15:32.889 --> 00:15:35.159
You cannot play games with yourself.

00:15:35.159 --> 00:15:39.399
You have to be very sincere. You
all should know how far you are,

00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:42.799
how far you are identified with your Spirit.

00:15:42.799 --> 00:15:50.522
Is very important, because you are yourself,
you are great seekers, of a very great value,

00:15:50.534 --> 00:15:53.752
and you should not play about with yourself.

00:15:53.782 --> 00:15:55.892
Pay full attention to your Spirit.

00:15:55.892 --> 00:15:58.582
Pay full attention to your sensitivity.

00:15:58.603 --> 00:16:03.796
How far you are sensitive, how far you can feel
others, how far you can understand others.

00:16:03.826 --> 00:16:13.684
And if there is somebody you find is rather, er, bit
too much caught up, just tell Me on the photograph.

00:16:13.684 --> 00:16:15.586
I’ll look after that person.

00:16:15.586 --> 00:16:18.169
We’ll try to improve him or improve her.

00:16:18.176 --> 00:16:21.259
If she does not, then we’ll get rid of her.

00:16:21.259 --> 00:16:25.926
But don’t get caught up yourself;
don’t get into trouble yourself.

00:16:25.951 --> 00:16:32.058
You are saints. You are great things. You
are not to suffer anymore. That’s over now.

00:16:32.058 --> 00:16:34.991
Let Me suffer for you. You
don’t have to suffer at all.

00:16:35.046 --> 00:16:37.281
So you be careful about yourself.

00:16:37.281 --> 00:16:42.001
Now, know your personality, respect
your Spirit and rise in that.

00:16:42.014 --> 00:16:48.311
And don’t in any way allow yourself to be
exploited, or to be tortured by anything.

00:16:48.311 --> 00:16:50.521
Try to rise.

00:16:50.521 --> 00:16:52.640
In Sahaja Yoga, as you know,

00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:56.631
the time as it passes you become
matured and matured and matured

00:16:56.631 --> 00:17:03.191
and, and that’s why we have everywhere, I have
appointed somebody as the leader of the thing.

00:17:03.191 --> 00:17:07.551
One person has to be the leader. I cannot
contact all of you, I’ve said many a time.

00:17:07.551 --> 00:17:11.361
So now, as we have one leader of every place,

00:17:11.368 --> 00:17:14.701
let us have everything done through one leader,

00:17:14.701 --> 00:17:18.408
because if I have to scold I can only scold
one person. That’s Christine in New York.

00:17:18.441 --> 00:17:25.034
Or I can scold Danny in one place like
that, or I can scold some Alexander.

00:17:25.068 --> 00:17:30.263
Now, say, in France they created a
problem for Me this Jean Francois,

00:17:30.293 --> 00:17:33.813
you see, he’s another mad cap, I should
say. I don’t know what to call him.

00:17:33.813 --> 00:17:38.326
I never said anything to him, because
I don’t know French language

00:17:38.326 --> 00:17:40.566
and I don’t know. How will
I speak anything to him?

00:17:40.581 --> 00:17:44.535
He’s just saying that, “Mother said you are
a great leader. You are this. You are that.”

00:17:44.535 --> 00:17:47.361
He’s behaving just like Patrick. Can you imagine?

00:17:48.951 --> 00:17:51.451
Why will I say to him that, “You are like this”

00:17:51.451 --> 00:17:55.333
and if I say, supposing there must
be somebody to translate, isn’t it?

00:17:55.333 --> 00:17:59.103
But he is self-appointed person
there. I’m getting news about him.

00:17:59.145 --> 00:18:01.645
That’s why we've decided not to go to Toulouse.

00:18:01.645 --> 00:18:05.574
But this kind of a nonsense is
not going to work out at all.

00:18:05.574 --> 00:18:11.358
This kind of, you cannot use Sahaja Yoga
for money. You cannot use it for power

00:18:11.374 --> 00:18:13.194
You can only use it for your ascent.

00:18:13.194 --> 00:18:16.886
Like some people think, “I’ve
become the leader of this.”

00:18:16.914 --> 00:18:19.414
How can you become? And, “Mother told me.”

00:18:19.414 --> 00:18:25.223
Of all the things, I don’t know French,
a word. I know three, four words.

00:18:25.229 --> 00:18:27.729
And he doesn’t know English.

00:18:27.729 --> 00:18:32.018
How will I, how will I tell him
something, which I don’t know,

00:18:32.038 --> 00:18:37.638
and that nobody knows about I am telling him in
privacy or can I talk in privacy French language?

00:18:41.399 --> 00:18:46.617
Who is from there? From
Toulouse? Somebody has come? No.

00:18:48.487 --> 00:18:50.546
No, no, no, nobody from Toulouse.

00:18:51.546 --> 00:18:52.956
You are from Toulouse?

00:18:53.996 --> 00:18:57.869
Now what do you say of him?

00:18:57.897 --> 00:19:05.227
It was beautiful because for us
it was a big programme, I mean…And

00:19:05.227 --> 00:19:05.987
Loudly.

00:19:08.477 --> 00:19:17.771
Well, it’s some strange thing because I was going big distance because I have many things and because to get here tonight.

00:19:17.781 --> 00:19:26.949
Because at last tour I was too remembering for (unclear)

00:19:26.964 --> 00:19:34.229
And we have things from Paris, we have things
from Toulouse and we didn’t know how to manage

00:19:34.235 --> 00:19:40.071
and at last, things are at clear tonight. Thank you.

00:19:40.089 --> 00:19:44.751
But I made it extremely clear,
of course, in English language

00:19:44.751 --> 00:19:53.395
but I, I made it so very clear that
it is Alexander with whom I deal.

00:19:53.391 --> 00:19:55.294
Yes

00:19:55.294 --> 00:19:57.794
What do you say, Marie?

00:19:57.794 --> 00:20:09.040
It was extremely clear, but somehow he managed to work out the contrary as to what You said, and to tell other people.

00:20:09.047 --> 00:20:13.170
I mean, this sort of a thing you should
refer back to Me. Thank God it is referred.

00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:14.820
At least it won’t go too far.

00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:20.640
Like, Patrick appointed himself,
self-appointment, the leader of the North America.

00:20:20.636 --> 00:20:24.258
Just imagine. And I never knew.

00:20:24.269 --> 00:20:27.168
Who told him, I don’t know.

00:20:27.179 --> 00:20:29.679
And how much he troubled Me.

00:20:29.679 --> 00:20:36.584
So anybody says like that, you refer it to
Me. Please refer it to Me, immediately.

00:20:36.611 --> 00:20:43.341
And understand that these useless, egoistical
people are trying to be very funny.

00:20:43.371 --> 00:20:48.241
Let him do what he likes in Toulouse, but you do
exactly what Alexander says, and I’ll see him.

00:20:48.249 --> 00:20:53.001
I’ll talk to him. He was a
headache, in India, was he not?

00:20:55.166 --> 00:20:59.527
He was a big headache there and
suddenly now he becomes a leader.

00:21:00.985 --> 00:21:03.485
I just don’t know. So please
don’t do all these things.

00:21:03.485 --> 00:21:09.840
Try to keep one person in charge. I appoint
somebody by understanding that person.

00:21:09.869 --> 00:21:15.349
Everything I understand, and then I appoint
that person. So don’t challenge Me, please.

00:21:15.369 --> 00:21:18.859
None of you should do that. I
would request you not to do this.

00:21:18.878 --> 00:21:25.129
So for all practical purposes, all North
America should work through Christine.

00:21:25.139 --> 00:21:34.449
Christine has to inform Me. I cannot telephone
to all of you. Otherwise, I’ll become bankrupt.

00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:41.905
If we have every telephone is one leader,
say, then what will happen to Me?

00:21:41.916 --> 00:21:44.846
So just keep to one person, all right?

00:21:44.896 --> 00:21:47.396
Is it all right, Steve? Do you understand that?

00:21:47.396 --> 00:21:52.685
You refer it to Christine, all of you. Refer it to Christine.

00:21:53.525 --> 00:21:56.865
All right? She is the main person here.

00:21:56.895 --> 00:22:02.945
And for others who are in their particular
places, like you are there in Boston,

00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:09.817
or somebody is there in Vancouver, like that,
in every place you have one person in charge.

00:22:09.834 --> 00:22:12.067
But let her be in charge of all that.

00:22:12.067 --> 00:22:16.295
I cannot telephone even to San Francisco, to San Diego.

00:22:16.295 --> 00:22:18.795
So you must accept it,

00:22:18.795 --> 00:22:22.527
because she is the one who came all the
way from there to start Sahaja Yoga.

00:22:22.527 --> 00:22:26.259
It is she who started this Sahaja Yoga, isn’t it?

00:22:26.298 --> 00:22:32.099
Like they told me that one Mr. Arizono
came here and you named the thing at,

00:22:32.118 --> 00:22:34.618
he has (unclear: named) even
today that’s how she came here.

00:22:34.618 --> 00:22:39.369
So I know her. There’s nothing wrong
with her. Her vibrations are good.

00:22:39.369 --> 00:22:42.729
She’s perfectly all right. She’s very sensitive.

00:22:42.729 --> 00:22:45.739
If I find anything wrong with her I will correct her.

00:22:45.739 --> 00:22:50.621
Now this is, say, simple plain English
language which I have learned.

00:22:50.609 --> 00:22:56.694
But you do not read into words now,
anymore. It is simple as that.

00:22:56.731 --> 00:23:02.676
I want to make it very clear, because I shouted at her and she was very nervous and she cried and wept and all that; happened.

00:23:02.685 --> 00:23:06.255
Doesn’t matter. But I’ve shouted at
her, because she is responsible.

00:23:06.287 --> 00:23:16.351
She has to assert herself and she has to see and accounts from Boston or from Vancouver should be brought to My notice.

00:23:16.372 --> 00:23:20.831
They should be sent to India. I would
like to see how you people are managing.

00:23:20.861 --> 00:23:28.611
So the one account will be for the future plans and
one account should be, you should manage ad hoc.

00:23:29.755 --> 00:23:34.714
Like you want to have a, say, you want
to have a programme of your own.

00:23:34.715 --> 00:23:37.034
For that you want to collect
some money; is all right.

00:23:37.034 --> 00:23:39.534
But one should never start collections.

00:23:39.534 --> 00:23:44.324
You know, in India. It’s very common in
the West. In India nobody does that.

00:23:44.324 --> 00:23:47.744
Very common; we had a horrible time in London.

00:23:47.744 --> 00:23:52.304
There was one fellow called
Peter Pierce. He came from TM.

00:23:52.304 --> 00:23:55.444
And when I went away he
started a Building Account.

00:23:55.453 --> 00:24:00.130
I don’t know which building it was. Without
the land, without anything, a Building Account.

00:24:00.131 --> 00:24:05.726
And he had taken one house, that
Chelsham Road, and he started it.

00:24:05.726 --> 00:24:12.179
And they collected five thousand pounds, and
no-one knows what happened to that account.

00:24:12.202 --> 00:24:17.739
He took two thousand pounds from My husband.

00:24:17.754 --> 00:24:22.039
Can you imagine such a thing? And within
three months’ time when I was in India.

00:24:22.039 --> 00:24:25.492
But I don’t know why My
husband trusted him so much.

00:24:27.957 --> 00:24:31.452
Then everybody gave him five
thousand pounds and two thousand;

00:24:31.472 --> 00:24:33.972
seven thousand pounds he had nicely with him,

00:24:33.972 --> 00:24:38.108
but the result was such that he became bankrupt.

00:24:38.112 --> 00:24:42.758
And it was such a bad result that the
government asked him to get out of the country

00:24:42.791 --> 00:24:48.139
and he had to leave the country and now he
is in Africa in a very, very bad state.

00:24:48.154 --> 00:24:54.169
Whatever he did for seven thousand
pounds has ruined him completely.

00:24:54.202 --> 00:24:58.209
Imagine; he’s nowhere now.
I mean, he is gone away.

00:24:58.239 --> 00:25:05.946
His wife and children he lost. Everything he lost. And he’s just all alone there in a very bad shape.

00:25:07.655 --> 00:25:10.155
I’ve told you that it is God’s money,

00:25:10.155 --> 00:25:17.186
and these are saints. You cannot collect out of
saints something and spend it the way you like.

00:25:17.216 --> 00:25:20.456
Ravanna used to do that way, and
you know what happened to Ravanna.

00:25:22.293 --> 00:25:24.666
So one should never, because I do not take money.

00:25:24.666 --> 00:25:29.096
That doesn’t mean that anybody should collect
money like that; seven thousands pounds...

00:25:29.127 --> 00:25:31.627
Danny knows all about it.

00:25:33.477 --> 00:25:35.136
It’s very wrong.

00:25:35.136 --> 00:25:39.415
You understand that this is God’s work.

00:25:39.456 --> 00:25:42.335
And you cannot do anything like that.

00:25:42.386 --> 00:25:45.655
This is very important. Otherwise,
money problem will never be solved.

00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:48.725
It will never be solved. For
the time being you might feel,

00:25:48.725 --> 00:25:51.763
but then everything will be wasted.

00:25:51.801 --> 00:25:54.301
So be careful on that; be very careful.

00:25:54.301 --> 00:25:56.801
You have to be honest people.

00:25:56.801 --> 00:26:01.383
Just now that Doudoudiem was telling Me
that in Sudan they are having a shariat

00:26:01.383 --> 00:26:07.475
that anybody steals even a, say,
a fruit, they cut the hands.

00:26:07.502 --> 00:26:09.585
In Sudan; just imagine!

00:26:09.585 --> 00:26:15.652
Now we don’t want that kind of a thing to happen here,
that people should cut anybody’s hands or anything.

00:26:15.652 --> 00:26:23.226
But it is a serious thing, because this
is God’s money; this is God’s work.

00:26:23.226 --> 00:26:28.499
Has to be done with that
understanding and dedication.

00:26:28.499 --> 00:26:38.202
Every paisa that was collected for even Indian tour
was recorded, put into things, every bit of it.

00:26:40.183 --> 00:26:43.712
Yes, I’ll just have that little one.
All right? And thank you, thank you all.

00:26:43.729 --> 00:26:48.034
But I think I speak for everyone here
that everyone will support Christine.

00:26:48.064 --> 00:26:50.564
And I would think everyone here feels the same,

00:26:50.571 --> 00:26:54.919
that she’s the ideal choice to be
the leader of America, North America.

00:26:54.959 --> 00:26:59.429
Thank you, thank you very
much, thank you, thank you.

00:27:04.869 --> 00:27:09.239
And you don’t judge your leaders. Let
Me judge them. All right? Just let Me.

00:27:09.239 --> 00:27:14.089
Try to, try to understand that our, most
of the instructions are coming from Me.

00:27:14.109 --> 00:27:18.415
Because I shout at her and
she looks at Me like this.

00:27:18.439 --> 00:27:22.905
So I said, “What are you doing?
Why are you not strong?

00:27:22.946 --> 00:27:28.196
(Break in this version of the talk. Recommences as She Mataji is talking about photography.)  Horrible!

00:27:28.214 --> 00:27:34.874
But must be something special about you
people, that you handle this subject like that.

00:27:34.909 --> 00:27:39.744
Like today, you see, in the shop, the lady
said, “Oh, You, You had come with Your husband.”

00:27:39.744 --> 00:27:42.744
And I said, “Which one?”

00:27:44.524 --> 00:27:48.834
And that was Raja, Rajabhai Modi. I said,
“That’s My son. What are you meaning?”

00:27:52.244 --> 00:27:55.654
Imagine, what age I must have looked.

00:27:55.678 --> 00:28:01.024
Just imagine. I was wondering what, what camera
she must have used to create such a nonsense.

00:28:02.516 --> 00:28:05.016
Very nice lady, very nice.

00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:12.380
Camera is Mahamaya.

00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:14.880
(Shri Mataji unwraps a present.)

00:28:18.810 --> 00:28:21.310
Lotus in a lotus.

00:28:27.983 --> 00:28:29.575
Is it American made?

00:28:29.603 --> 00:28:32.103
I don’t know Mother, I don’t know.

00:28:36.603 --> 00:28:39.103
I see all that.

00:28:42.119 --> 00:28:44.619
But is it made in America, no?

00:28:45.889 --> 00:28:49.100
I must see that because......

00:28:49.109 --> 00:28:53.430
Yes, beautiful. I would like to
see what porcelain Americans make.

00:28:56.269 --> 00:28:57.839
Nothing there.

00:28:57.853 --> 00:29:00.353
Beautiful porcelain, isn’t it?

00:29:04.103 --> 00:29:10.052
What an idea. It’s really beautiful porcelain.

00:29:15.012 --> 00:29:18.857
Because in the shops you don’t find
any American porcelain anywhere.

00:29:18.890 --> 00:29:22.517
It’s all Chinese or something.

00:29:22.540 --> 00:29:25.040
So I wanted to know.

00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:28.380
But I didn’t find any American porcelain anywhere.

00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:30.880
I think they are not very much interested.

00:29:33.130 --> 00:29:39.028
Nor did I find any crystal, American crystal.

00:29:41.111 --> 00:29:43.611
I don’t think they make any. Do they?

00:29:43.611 --> 00:29:53.132
I don’t think so, Mother. I think most of Americans buy
Waterford crystal, made by the Irish, German, Yugoslav.

00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:56.391
They don’t have any crystal, no?

00:29:56.390 --> 00:29:59.991
And the, and the, this also,

00:30:00.002 --> 00:30:05.050
this they don’t make. But the, the
crockery you use, is from where?

00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:09.660
Mainly crockery that the most
people like is English.

00:30:09.674 --> 00:30:13.922
There are all kinds of Royal
Doulton, all that kind of thing.

00:30:13.952 --> 00:30:18.512
Americans, there are also some china,
but I really don’t know so much of that.

00:30:21.992 --> 00:30:26.938
I mean, they never had this in America?

00:30:26.974 --> 00:30:30.428
So what other hand-made things they do?

00:30:30.454 --> 00:30:32.954
I mean before they started this.

00:30:32.954 --> 00:30:35.454
They must be doing some handwork.

00:30:38.964 --> 00:30:41.738
Woodwork?

00:30:41.746 --> 00:30:45.236
That, that’s all right, that’s,
they are not Americans, in a way.

00:30:45.256 --> 00:30:48.770
But to what handwork they
must have done before.

00:30:50.270 --> 00:30:51.120
Can you say?

00:30:51.130 --> 00:30:55.766
Good carpenters, Mother. They are good carpenters
and they make nice interiors of houses,

00:30:55.782 --> 00:31:02.501
wood houses, wood floors, cupboards.
But they, they made a lot of …

00:31:02.532 --> 00:31:05.032
No, but I mean in decorativeness.

00:31:05.032 --> 00:31:07.129
What do you say?

00:31:07.159 --> 00:31:09.659
In decorativeness, what
Americans have been making?

00:31:09.659 --> 00:31:10.949
Sculptures.

00:31:10.949 --> 00:31:12.179
Sculptures?

00:31:12.179 --> 00:31:14.439
Yes, all plastic, Mother.

00:31:14.439 --> 00:31:16.739
No, but in olden days they must be making.

00:31:16.739 --> 00:31:17.666
Jewellery?

00:31:17.666 --> 00:31:19.839
Jewellery, they are best in the world.

00:31:19.839 --> 00:31:22.339
Is it?

00:31:22.339 --> 00:31:23.999
Yes, Mother. They are the
best in the world, Mother.

00:31:23.999 --> 00:31:28.169
Their designs are, they have the most
designs; Cartier, New York.

00:31:28.169 --> 00:31:29.139
Is it?

00:31:29.169 --> 00:31:30.649
Excellent jewellers.

00:31:30.649 --> 00:31:33.149
I didn’t find anywhere.

00:31:36.568 --> 00:31:42.469
Mother, we have to go in the market. We have
to do the market. It’s not far from the hall.

00:31:42.529 --> 00:31:45.029
No, no, what I am saying before all this started.

00:31:45.029 --> 00:31:50.197
Yes. Beautiful, exquisite [unclear]
glass stone You will find there.

00:31:50.228 --> 00:31:53.742
Glass made.

00:31:53.802 --> 00:31:56.392
Crockery they make? What, which one?

00:31:56.433 --> 00:31:57.442
They made before.

00:31:57.442 --> 00:31:58.432
Before, yeah

00:31:58.432 --> 00:32:09.168
And even now there are good potters, but they have a choice between making special things, which they have to get as it is very expensive.

00:32:09.168 --> 00:32:12.209
Oh, hand-made must be expensive here, isn’t it?

00:32:12.228 --> 00:32:19.679
But there isn’t anything like in India or in Mexico where good quality things are available. (unclear)

00:32:19.709 --> 00:32:23.899
And the weaving they must
be doing in the olden days?

00:32:23.919 --> 00:32:31.169
You remember, Christine, you sent Me one, you’ve
seen… But that’s not American? That is Mexican.

00:32:31.204 --> 00:32:37.774
Yes. Just American china. American
china and I haven’t mentioned that.

00:32:37.779 --> 00:32:40.279
American china is there?

00:32:41.939 --> 00:32:42.769
In silver?

00:32:42.769 --> 00:32:45.269
Old silver, yes.

00:32:46.499 --> 00:32:47.844
Old silver what?

00:32:47.844 --> 00:32:50.344
Old silver [unclear] in America [unclear].

00:32:54.418 --> 00:32:55.922
But there’s no demand for any.

00:32:55.922 --> 00:32:56.558
What?

00:32:56.558 --> 00:33:01.921
There’s no demand for any. The masses
don’t demand it so there is no profit in it.

00:33:01.941 --> 00:33:03.021
I didn’t follow.

00:33:03.021 --> 00:33:08.971
Not enough demand for it, Mother, not enough people
want it. So they don’t produce too much of it anymore.

00:33:09.004 --> 00:33:11.001
What is that?

00:33:11.014 --> 00:33:17.361
The... you know, aesthetic, [unclear] things like
that. The average person simply can’t afford it.

00:33:17.407 --> 00:33:19.907
But what is that they produce actually?

00:33:19.929 --> 00:33:24.970
OK, although they do produce a lot of things [but
I think], they do heavy machinery production.

00:33:24.970 --> 00:33:31.890
And there’s, there’s not much that goes into the
household items, so much imported, that is in plastic.

00:33:31.944 --> 00:33:35.220
But not on these finer things, I think.

00:33:35.219 --> 00:33:37.719
(unclear)

00:33:54.913 --> 00:33:59.410
Only in Toledo I found they were
making beautiful glass things,

00:33:59.410 --> 00:34:05.040
beautiful bells of glass and all
that, hand things, hand-made, Toledo.

00:34:05.041 --> 00:34:09.240
Tiffan was the name of the place
where I went. It’s a village like...

00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:09.968
Murano.

00:34:09.968 --> 00:34:14.086
And I was really surprised how
they were moulding into things

00:34:14.086 --> 00:34:17.768
and beautiful things they
were making out of glass.

00:34:17.779 --> 00:34:19.869
Very nice.

00:34:19.888 --> 00:34:23.849
Like bangles not there, but
something like this kind.

00:34:29.169 --> 00:34:36.757
So there must have been lots of things of that kind here, because industrial development took much late, isn’t it?

00:34:36.767 --> 00:34:40.409
It came much later in life.

00:34:40.417 --> 00:34:48.647
So they must have lived with, you see, some
sort of plates and things must have had.

00:34:59.574 --> 00:35:02.074
Oven thing.

00:35:06.086 --> 00:35:08.586
But that, too, was made in Poland.

00:35:08.586 --> 00:35:11.086
I’ll try next time.

00:35:12.526 --> 00:35:16.059
It’s like, you know, you want to
see something made in America.

00:35:16.059 --> 00:35:18.019
You don’t find anything.

00:35:19.459 --> 00:35:25.109
But if we are looking then in the assembly line which
is, was the, the exploiter of the mass production.

00:35:25.135 --> 00:35:28.769
So we moved away from the er what
we would call cottage industry.

00:35:28.778 --> 00:35:34.038
No, but sort of, we want to have,
say, something made in here.

00:35:35.667 --> 00:35:38.167
Eh? What she’s saying?

00:35:38.167 --> 00:35:40.048
They make blue jeans.

00:35:40.048 --> 00:35:42.548
They make blue jeans here.

00:35:43.058 --> 00:35:45.558
Blue jeans.

00:35:47.299 --> 00:35:49.018
The American hand-made things.

00:35:49.018 --> 00:35:50.569
Blue jeans?

00:35:50.599 --> 00:35:52.139
The Americans have no taste.

00:35:52.139 --> 00:35:53.439
Americans what?

00:35:53.459 --> 00:35:54.789
They have no taste.

00:35:54.822 --> 00:35:58.159
I think they are the greatest,
that's why you are all existing.

00:36:03.684 --> 00:36:08.036
They buy from all over the world. You
don’t know, you get Chinese goods here.

00:36:08.070 --> 00:36:12.626
Every sort of good you can get in America
where you cannot find it anywhere.

00:36:12.628 --> 00:36:17.968
All the best things there. I've even bought
all the old things from all over the world.

00:36:18.001 --> 00:36:20.268
I mean, they have a good taste, no doubt.

00:36:20.288 --> 00:36:23.448
They are the ones who got
the sense of antiques also.

00:36:23.448 --> 00:36:25.948
They are the ones who introduced
this idea of antique.

00:36:25.948 --> 00:36:31.332
I wouldn’t say that, but what I am
saying that there should be something.

00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:34.442
Why I am asking you this question is this:

00:36:35.870 --> 00:36:38.370
everything I say has something behind it.

00:36:41.757 --> 00:36:46.517
Now you tell Me why. Let’s see how
far you understand Your Mother.

00:36:46.517 --> 00:36:51.031
Course we should be, we should be doing
something. We should be making handicrafts.

00:36:51.045 --> 00:36:52.311
What is needed…

00:36:52.311 --> 00:36:53.861
No, no.

00:36:53.870 --> 00:36:55.361
To create the beauty.

00:36:55.381 --> 00:36:57.461
Not that. No, no.

00:36:59.901 --> 00:37:02.562
Some sort of enterprise that
Sahaja Yogis can do together? So

00:37:03.962 --> 00:37:05.091
You are very near.

00:37:07.372 --> 00:37:10.362
You see, why I am saying so…

00:37:10.362 --> 00:37:13.272
First I was thinking that we’ll come to America.

00:37:13.272 --> 00:37:17.832
We’ll propagate; it will work out
very well, Sahaja Yoga, this, that.

00:37:17.832 --> 00:37:22.332
But I found the people, you see, they get realisation;
then they are finished. They are no more there.

00:37:22.347 --> 00:37:26.514
They do not take it that seriously.
They become frivolous or thing.

00:37:26.514 --> 00:37:30.027
So how to settle them down? Because
the environment is very bad;

00:37:30.027 --> 00:37:35.260
environment is so bad that everything fizzles
out, you see; everything sort of fritters away.

00:37:35.267 --> 00:37:38.457
Everything. I mean, the
seriousness of it goes away.

00:37:38.457 --> 00:37:43.627
People just try to play with Sahaja Yoga, little
bit here and there. They don’t take it seriously.

00:37:43.631 --> 00:37:47.015
So I thought of a plan which
I’ve told you before also,

00:37:47.044 --> 00:37:55.442
that in a big land in India, I was thinking of
starting a school for teaching them Indian crafts.

00:37:57.982 --> 00:38:02.652
And that for that, whatever you are
not making here, we can make there.

00:38:02.652 --> 00:38:06.269
But now I find that you are making nothing. So…

00:38:11.482 --> 00:38:19.232
So I was thinking of inviting people
from America to come down there,

00:38:19.232 --> 00:38:22.522
settle down there for three months
and learn a particular craft.

00:38:22.534 --> 00:38:25.034
We can have about twenty-one
crafts I've found out,

00:38:25.034 --> 00:38:33.134
which are very, absolutely very, very Indian crafts and old crafts, and they can be taught very easily.

00:38:33.166 --> 00:38:35.233
Within three months you can pick up the craft.

00:38:35.233 --> 00:38:40.233
But by that, learning by that, you
won’t be able to do it yourself

00:38:40.276 --> 00:38:43.715
because it’s a, it’s, er,
labour, it’s very expensive here.

00:38:43.745 --> 00:38:47.775
But what you can do is that,
supposing you like something,

00:38:47.807 --> 00:38:52.395
and now you have, now for
example this piece of silk.

00:38:52.411 --> 00:38:57.441
Now to get it in the market it’s
easy that you go and get it.

00:38:57.451 --> 00:39:05.967
But supposing you know the craft, then you can precisely say what sort of a thing you would like to have to sell it.

00:39:05.986 --> 00:39:09.154
So you might have something
very unique things to suggest.

00:39:09.154 --> 00:39:12.676
Because Indians whatever they will
send you whatever they have.

00:39:12.679 --> 00:39:17.756
But your style, what you want
to have or what is you like,

00:39:17.781 --> 00:39:22.796
whatever you will be using that only
if you know the craft you can... Yes.

00:39:22.826 --> 00:39:25.852
Mother, Radha was having an idea,

00:39:25.866 --> 00:39:33.712
because there is good leather in India which
is imported in form of raw material [unclear].

00:39:33.723 --> 00:39:40.567
Theoretically, tradition of leather was here in this country, and there’s definitely a market for it also.

00:39:40.564 --> 00:39:43.757
That is just an idea.

00:39:43.767 --> 00:39:46.267
I mean, you want to export.

00:39:47.827 --> 00:39:51.987
You see, all such handmade things from
here cannot fetch you much money,

00:39:51.987 --> 00:39:54.787
because the reason is, it is very expensive.

00:39:54.804 --> 00:39:58.544
But you can get it, cheaper things
from other countries, like Taiwan,

00:39:58.544 --> 00:40:01.044
this, that, is sending to you, but cheapish stuff.

00:40:01.044 --> 00:40:03.814
But from India you can get genuine, good things.

00:40:03.814 --> 00:40:06.014
That’s what I am talking about.

00:40:06.014 --> 00:40:07.034
Leather work.

00:40:07.034 --> 00:40:16.894
Leather work from India, made in USA. For the
American market. That’s what I am talking about.

00:40:16.894 --> 00:40:22.022
But that is the taste part of it you
can tell us if you know the craft,

00:40:22.950 --> 00:40:23.592
isn’t it?

00:40:23.592 --> 00:40:30.332
If you don’t know the craft little bit, at least, you
won’t be able to exactly say or design it and say.

00:40:30.332 --> 00:40:34.742
Another thing says, Indian furniture or
something, it’s quite good, hand-made.

00:40:34.789 --> 00:40:40.858
Now if we send you the parts of the furniture,
if you know the craft, you can assemble it.

00:40:40.882 --> 00:40:43.382
it would be much cheaper to send it here.

00:40:43.382 --> 00:40:46.542
(short break)

00:40:46.590 --> 00:40:51.388
country, which you can first of all what I
would suggest that you must learn the craft,

00:40:51.398 --> 00:40:57.488
little bit, to understand what can be done.
Supposing now this is the thing in pieces.

00:40:57.488 --> 00:41:04.698
Now you should know in this what we can do,
how far can we go, what colours we can use.

00:41:04.714 --> 00:41:09.254
And then you exactly tell that
this is what we have to do.

00:41:09.258 --> 00:41:11.758
Then the people can do it.
Then you can sell them here.

00:41:11.758 --> 00:41:17.833
But Sahaja Yoga should never be
involved with any, any business.

00:41:17.863 --> 00:41:22.743
I hope it is clear. No business should
be done under the name of Sahaja Yoga.

00:41:22.743 --> 00:41:29.562
Hah, you can have your own cooperative
or anything between yourselves,

00:41:29.572 --> 00:41:36.773
but never, never use Sahaja Yoga, the
name, My name or anything for any business.

00:41:36.783 --> 00:41:39.893
Sahaja Yoga is doing no business at all.

00:41:39.893 --> 00:41:50.973
But by this kind of a thing, we’ll generate a better taste,
better aesthetics, better living standards in this country.

00:41:50.983 --> 00:41:55.161
So I would suggest that when
we start this programme,

00:41:57.463 --> 00:42:03.511
I have to also get one more “Yes”
from you, because you are Americans.

00:42:03.511 --> 00:42:10.002
And I think if that happens I will say that this,
My programme, has really reached its climax,

00:42:10.021 --> 00:42:13.332
because that’s one of the things
I wanted to know from you.

00:42:13.334 --> 00:42:17.828
That when we have that place done,

00:42:17.868 --> 00:42:21.548
I didn’t want to have it into cement and all that,

00:42:21.555 --> 00:42:29.952
to make cement houses and all, but I wanted to make it
into ethnic style of huts, but comfortable and clean.

00:42:29.982 --> 00:42:31.752
What do you say?

00:42:31.757 --> 00:42:34.257
Yes. Yes Mother.

00:42:41.907 --> 00:42:46.543
That’s good. Then that can be
done very easily, very soon.

00:42:46.568 --> 00:42:51.703
And we can start it this year, of course not, but
maybe next year we might start that kind of a school.

00:42:51.716 --> 00:42:56.603
We have already got teachers, we’ve got
everything and we’ve got land also.

00:42:56.636 --> 00:43:03.596
Can you imagine? And the land will be near some river
where you can jump into it every day, every minute.

00:43:09.787 --> 00:43:15.341
That would be nice near a river. We should have
a big place where you all can enjoy yourself.

00:43:15.341 --> 00:43:19.621
Anything else? Any other suggestion?

00:43:21.831 --> 00:43:23.201
Cooking classes.

00:43:23.201 --> 00:43:26.791
Yes, Indian cooking. We would
like to know Indian cooking.

00:43:26.813 --> 00:43:31.281
One of them is that. There are twenty-one crafts.

00:43:31.343 --> 00:43:36.093
Indian cooking, Indian sewing.

00:43:36.121 --> 00:43:42.673
Sewing also. Embroidery, then housekeeping.

00:43:51.665 --> 00:43:54.165
Husband management.

00:44:04.254 --> 00:44:08.565
How Indian women manage their husbands!

00:44:08.584 --> 00:44:11.084
Without arguing, without fighting.

00:44:11.084 --> 00:44:14.965
The husbands, just, you see,
never allow them to cook.

00:44:18.171 --> 00:44:22.405
No cooking will be allowed to be learned by men.

00:44:24.529 --> 00:44:32.340
So the women will know only the cooking and
men will have to come home to have their food.

00:44:41.881 --> 00:44:45.394
That’s how we manage our husbands.

00:44:45.431 --> 00:44:49.004
Best way to manage your husband is
through his stomach and tongue.

00:44:51.284 --> 00:44:54.625
Every man is a child as
far as this is concerned.

00:44:54.625 --> 00:44:57.125
Children marketing, Mother.

00:44:57.125 --> 00:45:01.944
Children. They are all children as
far as food is concerned, you see.

00:45:01.953 --> 00:45:07.328
So, if you know how to make Indian food, I tell you
there are so many permutations and combinations,

00:45:07.324 --> 00:45:12.014
that they look forward. You see, every day
you don’t have the same stuff in India.

00:45:12.034 --> 00:45:18.674
The repetition may come after two, three days or
maybe after two, three years if you are an expert cook.

00:45:18.727 --> 00:45:20.252
It’s like that.

00:45:22.078 --> 00:45:29.787
So… and decorations of the
house, everything we’ll have it.

00:45:29.811 --> 00:45:31.291
Like stone carving.

00:45:31.291 --> 00:45:39.651
Stone carving, wood carving, ivory
carving and there are other carving also.

00:45:39.651 --> 00:45:47.235
We have what you call, yes, this is a
silversmith, goldsmith, that is there.

00:45:47.235 --> 00:45:53.630
And also weaving, weaving of different types.

00:45:53.630 --> 00:45:58.635
What else? There are twenty-one,
we found out, which are very easy.

00:45:59.348 --> 00:46:00.578
What about painting?

00:46:00.578 --> 00:46:01.438
Aaaa?

00:46:01.448 --> 00:46:02.878
What about painting?

00:46:02.874 --> 00:46:04.308
Painting.

00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:08.928
In the village I think it’s called
Madhubani, if I’m pronouncing that correctly.

00:46:08.937 --> 00:46:10.333
I beg your pardon.

00:46:10.333 --> 00:46:19.987
Madhubani, I’ve read in a book about a village or area
in India where almost all of the women learn to paint.

00:46:19.987 --> 00:46:21.727
Oh, that’s in the north.

00:46:21.727 --> 00:46:25.953
Yes, I gave you paintings out of
that. You didn’t get the paintings?

00:46:25.974 --> 00:46:28.474
Those who got married, in their house, there?

00:46:28.474 --> 00:46:29.363
You have one?

00:46:29.363 --> 00:46:34.013
We have one, somewhere. You have given Daniel
one, I think. We have it, here. I’ll show them.

00:46:34.046 --> 00:46:40.073
Yes, I see. We have, the whole village
will be doing carving of the wood.

00:46:40.073 --> 00:46:42.433
Then one village will be doing the inlay work,

00:46:42.423 --> 00:46:44.923
one village will be doing painting work, like that.

00:46:44.923 --> 00:46:46.813
We can do that.

00:46:46.813 --> 00:46:51.663
That’s something very, very
remarkable that painting business.

00:46:52.966 --> 00:46:56.091
Not one village but quite many.

00:46:57.977 --> 00:46:59.301
Madhubani,

00:47:00.357 --> 00:47:08.203
Madhubani painting, yes. And then also
this, what you call knitting and cane work.

00:47:08.203 --> 00:47:10.517
Oh, beautiful!

00:47:10.517 --> 00:47:13.017
Canework,

00:47:13.017 --> 00:47:18.972
canework and making mattresses, chatais,
what you call, mats, and things like that.

00:47:19.015 --> 00:47:21.515
Canework; that all can do.

00:47:21.515 --> 00:47:30.017
inlay work, inlay work, inlay in wood, inlay
in under stone, inlay; all that you can learn.

00:47:30.737 --> 00:47:36.304
Could be many things, much many more like the,
you see, these things also we make very well,

00:47:36.304 --> 00:47:37.864
very decorative.

00:47:37.886 --> 00:47:40.984
Mandapas, we call them.
Extremely beautiful, they are.

00:47:40.984 --> 00:47:43.484
Very well done.

00:47:45.984 --> 00:47:48.484
Also many things we can learn it.

00:47:51.083 --> 00:47:58.143
Silver is very, very, nice, but in India they
don’t make silver utensils out of sheets.

00:47:58.163 --> 00:48:02.048
They make it out of, what you
call them, aaa....

00:48:03.785 --> 00:48:04.438
I don't know.

00:48:04.426 --> 00:48:06.228
moulded, moulded one.

00:48:06.246 --> 00:48:09.043
I’ll have the tea I think.
it has gone cold or not?

00:48:10.567 --> 00:48:12.400
It is moulded.

00:48:12.408 --> 00:48:13.740
And wax.

00:48:13.761 --> 00:48:14.743
Wax work?

00:48:14.743 --> 00:48:18.330
And in wax and then they melt it like for the casting.

00:48:18.354 --> 00:48:19.634
Casting.

00:48:19.634 --> 00:48:24.862
And also, they do wax work
on the saris and clothes.

00:48:26.412 --> 00:48:29.114
That’s very… what they are called? Batik.

00:48:30.422 --> 00:48:32.542
They do a batik also on the leather work.

00:48:32.515 --> 00:48:35.942
Leather work, batik, very
beautiful leather. Batik work.

00:48:35.942 --> 00:48:41.012
But only thing is when you will be there you will be
as it is that the American taste, as he’s saying.

00:48:41.047 --> 00:48:43.547
We’ll have something with the American taste.

00:48:43.547 --> 00:48:49.919
Then we are very good at doing certain
things which are very, very expensive here;

00:48:49.943 --> 00:48:59.418
is making frames out of
silver, gold, out of, er, horn.

00:48:59.449 --> 00:49:02.581
Horn, we are very good at horn carvings.

00:49:02.581 --> 00:49:05.872
Out of horn you can make
so many things in India

00:49:06.849 --> 00:49:09.349
And then this metal work,

00:49:09.349 --> 00:49:10.489
brass.

00:49:12.449 --> 00:49:14.949
All kinds of brass work. Glass work!

00:49:14.946 --> 00:49:20.186
We have tremendous glass and
our crockery also is very good now.

00:49:20.186 --> 00:49:24.176
Our crockery is now being exported to Russia.

00:49:24.201 --> 00:49:27.476
And also our crystal.

00:49:29.877 --> 00:49:35.920
Then we have, what you call, all kinds of
glass work; beautiful glass work we have.

00:49:36.928 --> 00:49:40.030
Beautiful animals and things
they make, beautiful.

00:49:42.047 --> 00:49:49.928
(Shri Mataji is shown something.)

00:49:50.964 --> 00:49:51.788
How did you get it?

00:49:51.788 --> 00:49:55.025
I don’t know. I just find
it somehow and it’s there.

00:49:57.906 --> 00:50:00.406
Yes, they are very different, aren’t they?

00:50:05.943 --> 00:50:08.583
She doesn’t want to leave you.

00:50:14.671 --> 00:50:15.661
Shanti.

00:50:15.673 --> 00:50:18.173
Is she still with Me or with You?

00:50:18.173 --> 00:50:20.673
Somewhere.

00:50:21.112 --> 00:50:22.302
Shanti.

00:50:28.452 --> 00:50:31.735
Then also we have our temples.

00:50:31.785 --> 00:50:34.885
How we make our temples, it’s
very interesting, you know.

00:50:34.885 --> 00:50:36.595
We remember that, its
stone carving, Mother.

00:50:36.628 --> 00:50:40.763
Stone carving. No,
that’s you carve stones.

00:50:40.783 --> 00:50:48.413
Then the carved stones are put in such a way that they, the complete pillar is made, you see, out of that.

00:50:48.443 --> 00:50:50.433
But that is also very big art.

00:50:50.453 --> 00:50:58.829
Sometimes the carved stones are such that you cannot make out whether it is one stone or there are many pieces.

00:50:58.849 --> 00:51:00.869
They are great.

00:51:01.929 --> 00:51:04.429
So we can learn so we can
make some temples here.

00:51:04.454 --> 00:51:08.099
Yes, you can, you can have.

00:51:08.132 --> 00:51:15.086
But what I would say that, it would be better that you, you learn it and tell them what do you want, you see.

00:51:15.086 --> 00:51:18.981
Like now we have lot of
carving, but say, Greek style.

00:51:18.981 --> 00:51:22.746
Or something, you have
four dimensional things.

00:51:22.751 --> 00:51:27.361
That they don’t do. You can tell them, “We
want four dimensional.” They can do it.

00:51:27.365 --> 00:51:30.741
Work it out on stone or marble,
anything you want to do.

00:51:32.046 --> 00:51:33.454
And toy making.

00:51:33.544 --> 00:51:34.674
What about mirror work?

00:51:34.685 --> 00:51:35.254
I beg your pardon.

00:51:35.254 --> 00:51:35.764
Mirror.

00:51:35.764 --> 00:51:39.284
Mirror work? Quite a lot. That’s
in embroidery and all that.

00:51:39.287 --> 00:51:40.017
And also...

00:51:40.017 --> 00:51:43.027
Oh Mother, I don’t know, elephant and
things we can hang on Christmas tree

00:51:43.027 --> 00:51:45.277
Yes, yes. That is, that is made there.

00:51:45.277 --> 00:51:48.487
That’s quite a lot; that’s
quite a lot you can do.

00:51:48.487 --> 00:51:53.300
Plus you see what they do, it is a mirror
work on the clothes and things like that,

00:51:53.335 --> 00:51:54.865
that also quite a lot.

00:51:54.865 --> 00:51:57.365
There is the whole country is
doing it;

00:51:58.425 --> 00:52:03.475
the whole country is. You won’t
know how, where to stop it.

00:52:07.090 --> 00:52:10.585
We make the beautiful
Ganapatis and all other things.

00:52:10.609 --> 00:52:15.680
Especially from Nagpur from where I
come, they make the best Ganapatis.

00:52:15.706 --> 00:52:23.084
There’s a kind of a... Now here this clay that
you use so expensive; in India is very cheap.

00:52:24.424 --> 00:52:26.764
Only thing we do not have proper firing.

00:52:26.764 --> 00:52:34.754
But we have crockery; we have got,
what you call that, er, porcelain,

00:52:34.791 --> 00:52:38.367
kind of a porcelain, beautiful.

00:52:38.391 --> 00:52:41.827
And we have ceramics; all
these three things we have.

00:52:41.832 --> 00:52:45.927
But they are to be properly understood
in Indian style. It’s very different.

00:52:45.962 --> 00:52:50.385
Like I went to Japan. I said, “I want
to, I’ve come to see some ceramics.”

00:52:50.415 --> 00:52:55.315
I went to one place where they were
making some ceramics with their hands.

00:52:55.346 --> 00:52:57.685
So they said, “Here they are all on leave.”

00:52:57.685 --> 00:53:02.915
I said, “Really? They are on holidays?” They said, “No, no, they have now gone to India to learn ceramics.”

00:53:02.938 --> 00:53:07.315
So I looked at them. I said,
“From where do you learn?”

00:53:07.324 --> 00:53:09.975
Then they told Me the place
from where they learn

00:53:10.014 --> 00:53:12.514
and that place is so close
to My husband’s place.

00:53:12.514 --> 00:53:15.706
When I went there I went to
see that, and it was there.

00:53:18.686 --> 00:53:24.636
Like that, so many, because, you see, we
haven’t got machinery so we, our hands work out.

00:53:24.636 --> 00:53:32.268
Kashmir work is, papier-mâché
work is so much, so much.

00:53:35.138 --> 00:53:39.510
There’s no end to it. Everything
they use it for making.

00:53:39.510 --> 00:53:42.838
They never allow any lines to go straight.

00:53:42.880 --> 00:53:45.990
It has to be worked out into something.

00:53:46.020 --> 00:53:49.446
Out of these also they make tent, tent things.

00:53:52.524 --> 00:53:56.376
But you see, that is how one should live
with the matter, to make it beautiful,

00:53:58.685 --> 00:54:01.415
and that can be brought
here for no money at all,

00:54:01.435 --> 00:54:06.875
quite cheaply, compared to these people are
making so much money and they have no taste also.

00:54:06.915 --> 00:54:14.455
But if you can get something like that, you can sell it for
a cheap price and people will have better taste to live.

00:54:14.475 --> 00:54:26.482
There I have been investigating it, the import
laws, and they are rather strict in this country.

00:54:26.482 --> 00:54:32.728
I’m not sure what they would consider, if they would consider things that are in pieces coming from another country

00:54:32.730 --> 00:54:35.878
(unclear)

00:54:35.920 --> 00:54:41.438
Certainly four things are heavily tariffed and controlled.

00:54:41.462 --> 00:54:43.962
So there is, export is high.

00:54:43.962 --> 00:54:48.833
(Unclear) If hand-made, is a labour by the
country which [unclear] no taxes at all.

00:54:48.833 --> 00:54:52.143
You see, if it is hand-made
in America, no problem.

00:54:52.153 --> 00:54:53.683
No tariff at all. True.

00:54:53.683 --> 00:54:56.893
You see, if it is hand-made, even
in England you’ll be surprised,

00:54:56.893 --> 00:55:01.815
such a conservative country.
If it is hand-made, nothing.

00:55:01.849 --> 00:55:05.455
You see, they want to enrich their country
because they don’t have hand-made things.

00:55:05.499 --> 00:55:08.815
Ha, for other things they do it.

00:55:08.839 --> 00:55:14.675
Not only that, but anything that is more than
hundred years it’s absolutely free of cost.

00:55:14.675 --> 00:55:17.945
Anything hand-made!

00:55:17.955 --> 00:55:21.586
You just find out; you’ll be amazed.

00:55:21.586 --> 00:55:25.046
Otherwise, you will have
no hand-made things here.

00:55:27.578 --> 00:55:30.078
We’ll be all moving in plastic bags.

00:55:33.998 --> 00:55:37.538
Horrible! Horrible picture!

00:55:37.538 --> 00:55:43.858
To change all that, to bring in Sahaja Yoga, we have
to have natural things, beautiful things around us.

00:55:43.858 --> 00:55:47.392
And it’s very simple to do,
to get all these things here.

00:55:47.392 --> 00:55:49.876
But also then their taste will develop.

00:55:49.875 --> 00:55:52.375
People will think more.
You see, you have brains,

00:55:52.375 --> 00:56:00.715
you have better aesthetics and you can suggest
better things which Indians may not have.

00:56:00.715 --> 00:56:03.215
But that you can suggest and get things;

00:56:03.215 --> 00:56:04.295
Knitted!

00:56:04.305 --> 00:56:11.344
Knitted, hand-knitted clothes, hand-knitted
shirts, hand-knitted things, you can get very well.

00:56:11.344 --> 00:56:16.024
Cotton, beautiful cotton!

00:56:16.048 --> 00:56:22.364
Now here you get very good cotton, but that cotton
is to be stitched into proper dresses and things.

00:56:22.394 --> 00:56:23.474
Children’s wear.

00:56:23.474 --> 00:56:26.384
Children’s wear? Oh, beautiful children!

00:56:26.428 --> 00:56:31.274
We have one lady, she’s making such
beautiful children’s wear, Mrs Nigham,

00:56:31.270 --> 00:56:36.820
but she says, “The market here is so
great that we don’t want to export it.”

00:56:39.316 --> 00:56:44.770
Just imagine. But now supposing, I mean, if
there are some people like you help her out,

00:56:44.774 --> 00:56:49.660
then she might give you something for export.
For she makes.... she says she has no time.

00:56:49.660 --> 00:56:51.676
Many people have stopped exporting.

00:56:51.707 --> 00:56:54.207
The market is so great in India itself.

00:56:55.527 --> 00:56:56.901
Handicrafts!

00:57:01.883 --> 00:57:05.121
And you can give lots of
suggestions, lots of suggestions.

00:57:05.121 --> 00:57:09.822
Like, say, now you have got this brass.

00:57:09.832 --> 00:57:11.722
Now, how to keep it shining all the time?

00:57:11.722 --> 00:57:15.152
You might be able to give
some suggestions also.

00:57:15.167 --> 00:57:17.812
We have lots of treatments, lots of
chemical treatments to make them shine

00:57:17.812 --> 00:57:20.312
Ha, that’s what we don’t have.

00:57:21.742 --> 00:57:25.113
Also, like, we don’t have
good buckles in India, say.

00:57:25.139 --> 00:57:29.213
Really, we don’t have. We don’t
have proper glues in India.

00:57:29.232 --> 00:57:36.122
And we don’t have zips. You should export your
zips from here and get a, get a purse instead.

00:57:37.869 --> 00:57:41.799
Yes, we don’t have. Many
things we don’t have there.

00:57:41.809 --> 00:57:48.699
Proper, what you call, today, this, Marie showed
Me something in which you can fix a picture.

00:57:48.705 --> 00:57:54.286
That’s such a nice, beautiful,
er, latch. We don’t have.

00:57:54.286 --> 00:57:57.505
In India we don’t have such nice latches.

00:58:01.756 --> 00:58:04.256
So many things!

00:58:04.256 --> 00:58:11.086
You can also export from here your taps, but I don’t
know; American taps are such that they don’t fit anywhere.

00:58:12.400 --> 00:58:14.900
Everything is so funny here.

00:58:14.900 --> 00:58:19.994
Your, er, this thing, electrical is hundred and ten.

00:58:20.015 --> 00:58:22.515
It doesn’t fit anywhere.

00:58:23.825 --> 00:58:26.325
Hundred and ten!

00:58:28.197 --> 00:58:32.070
Everything is like that. You can’t
buy anything electrical from here.

00:58:32.491 --> 00:58:34.991
Your television is  different.

00:58:34.991 --> 00:58:38.390
You cannot use the cameras that you use here.

00:58:40.571 --> 00:58:42.893
How is the videos?

00:58:42.891 --> 00:58:45.103
You cannot use for videos, you see.

00:58:45.103 --> 00:58:48.103
We cannot use your tape recorders.

00:58:48.109 --> 00:58:50.403
Nothing electrical we can use.

00:58:50.403 --> 00:58:51.883
So what a bulk is gone.

00:58:51.923 --> 00:58:54.423
See, what will you export?

00:58:54.423 --> 00:58:57.823
I mean, your government is seeing to
it that nothing should be exported.

00:59:02.688 --> 00:59:04.628
What will you export then?

00:59:04.645 --> 00:59:08.541
Electrical goods are out.
Now take another. Your cars:

00:59:08.558 --> 00:59:12.241
your cars are funny. Nobody wants it,
because one reason: they are too big.

00:59:15.452 --> 00:59:22.972
But [unclear] it started here. I don’t understand how the rest of the world got out of sync or we got out of sync.....

00:59:23.899 --> 00:59:26.749
That’s the thing with them
is, that’s the main thing.

00:59:26.773 --> 00:59:30.171
It is that they want to
do something different.

00:59:30.180 --> 00:59:32.431
Can I have My sweater please?

00:59:32.431 --> 00:59:35.821
They always want to do something different.

00:59:35.841 --> 00:59:42.899
And in doing so, they have alienated themselves,
separated themselves from the rest of the world.

00:59:44.209 --> 00:59:51.631
That’s the point is. They, they just
don’t want to do the way others can do.

00:59:54.421 --> 00:59:56.921
I mean, a simple thing like a sweater, you see.

00:59:56.921 --> 00:59:59.421
I wanted to buy one for My son-in-law.

00:59:59.421 --> 01:00:02.901
It’s all funny style. It’s
not one that he would wear.

01:00:02.902 --> 01:00:08.311
Whatever generally people wear, is not
available here. They were all English.

01:00:08.311 --> 01:00:13.038
Otherwise, with a neck like
that, with a collar like that.

01:00:13.035 --> 01:00:17.208
And the frocks you try to buy for your
children, they’ll have all funny things.

01:00:18.858 --> 01:00:21.833
All is funny things they make.

01:00:21.853 --> 01:00:24.353
I went to see the socks.

01:00:24.353 --> 01:00:27.783
Socks are colours like,

01:00:27.803 --> 01:00:30.303
what you call them,

01:00:30.303 --> 01:00:32.803
what colours, shocking pink!

01:00:32.803 --> 01:00:35.303
Now imagine Me wearing a shocking pink.

01:00:38.353 --> 01:00:44.996
Ha, then we went to buy, I mean it’s like
that, went to buy what you call them, goggles?

01:00:44.996 --> 01:00:48.633
The ladies’ goggles, all of them, are like
this. You’ll like a witch, you know.

01:00:48.648 --> 01:00:51.148
All of them having like this. This is ladies’.

01:00:51.148 --> 01:00:57.581
All of them had some sort of a white stuff or a golden
stuff or anything coming out up to this point.

01:00:58.551 --> 01:01:02.887
I mean, if you wear, it is for
the witches to wear like this.

01:01:02.917 --> 01:01:06.177
And no Indian woman would
wear a thing, I don’t know.

01:01:06.207 --> 01:01:07.977
What to buy? Then I didn’t buy.

01:01:07.977 --> 01:01:09.737
Same with the watches.

01:01:09.767 --> 01:01:12.877
Everything big problem,
you know. It’s odd-looking;

01:01:12.887 --> 01:01:15.387
nothing decent.

01:01:15.387 --> 01:01:19.207
It’s odd-looking. I mean, simple things like this.

01:01:19.207 --> 01:01:21.027
What is the....?

01:01:21.037 --> 01:01:26.018
Traditional style. The traditional styles you can’t
get. They import them from England and Switzerland.

01:01:26.018 --> 01:01:31.318
No, no, all right, I don’t say traditional it
should be, but something near decency, isn’t it?

01:01:31.318 --> 01:01:39.478
Now supposing you have a sweater like this. I mean,
you are not some king or someone to walk like that.

01:01:39.478 --> 01:01:41.978
It looks so funny, na?

01:01:42.898 --> 01:01:45.398
All funny looking, I mean to say.

01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:51.318
Mother, and they sell clothes that are
already worn out. So when you buy them

01:01:51.348 --> 01:01:52.568
Ha, with holes.

01:01:52.588 --> 01:01:53.258
Yes!

01:01:57.926 --> 01:02:00.426
It is I can’t understand.

01:02:13.665 --> 01:02:17.406
Anything that we found that was
really something, we can say,

01:02:17.401 --> 01:02:20.816
it’s traditional or something
that anybody can wear decently,

01:02:20.816 --> 01:02:25.336
was all English.  All English!

01:02:25.344 --> 01:02:29.256
Or Polish or anything else but American!

01:02:31.096 --> 01:02:37.529
Either the pants would be baggy or would be so
tight that once you wear it you cannot take it out.

01:02:48.779 --> 01:02:51.279
Very difficult.

01:02:51.899 --> 01:02:56.156
That’s why they have junks here. Nobody
can take it and nobody can purchase it.

01:03:05.019 --> 01:03:07.039
Same with jewellery, I must say.

01:03:07.039 --> 01:03:09.019
Jewellery is also quite odd, you know.

01:03:09.019 --> 01:03:13.979
In the ear such big, big things you
know, hang from here up to here.

01:03:14.009 --> 01:03:16.979
There are jewelleries also very funny and queer.

01:03:16.999 --> 01:03:21.609
The original jewellery they used to make
was beautiful but they stopped making it.

01:03:21.619 --> 01:03:24.269
They import all the stuff now.

01:03:27.536 --> 01:03:30.746
I don’t know what to say, but really I feel

01:03:30.759 --> 01:03:38.886
that people must come to some universal understanding
in this country which stands for universality.

01:03:38.896 --> 01:03:42.313
It’s, is the centre of collectivity.

01:03:44.363 --> 01:03:47.946
Then you go on seeing people also like that.

01:03:47.946 --> 01:03:52.484
They become very queer. There’s
no universality in them.

01:03:54.414 --> 01:03:56.796
Somebody will talk like this;
another will talk like that.

01:03:56.796 --> 01:03:59.576
Every time you have to adjust
your ears to every person.

01:04:01.468 --> 01:04:03.424
That’s not good.

01:04:03.424 --> 01:04:09.134
I mean, if you have to have rapport with the whole
world, you must have certain norms, isn’t it?

01:04:09.153 --> 01:04:14.154
And this country should create
norms. On the contrary, I would say.

01:04:35.424 --> 01:04:39.025
In these, I think twenty-five years or so,

01:04:39.039 --> 01:04:41.520
they have deviated so
much (teacup falls over)

01:04:41.545 --> 01:04:43.620
in individualism and all that. It’s too much.

01:04:43.620 --> 01:04:46.920
Now this is also a very
small cup, American style.

01:04:49.044 --> 01:04:50.310
It’s all right; doesn’t matter.

01:04:50.306 --> 01:04:54.687
Can you get something to clean?
It’s rather a small cup for a tea.

01:04:55.518 --> 01:04:57.597
It’s all right. You just bring some cloth.

01:04:57.597 --> 01:04:59.917
It’s all right. Doesn’t matter. Nothing to be worried

01:04:59.917 --> 01:05:02.967
So this is what happens.

01:05:02.967 --> 01:05:07.426
And one has to bring it to that normalcy.

01:05:08.817 --> 01:05:13.276
I don’t know when will be they think about it?

01:05:13.298 --> 01:05:18.908
It’s all right. That’s all right. We just only,
you have to use a little wet cloth for this,

01:05:18.908 --> 01:05:21.828
because the tea takes....,
the silk might get it.

01:05:21.838 --> 01:05:24.998
Just wet, wet it and little bit water.

01:05:30.698 --> 01:05:33.198
So,

01:05:33.198 --> 01:05:41.397
I would suggest that when you people try to do something,
like even having a video now, we had a problem.

01:05:41.397 --> 01:05:47.403
I said, please try to buy something
in which you’ll also have VHS,

01:05:47.436 --> 01:05:50.783
because now we can’t make for
Americans something separate.

01:05:50.783 --> 01:05:52.943
And you will be missing all the videos.

01:05:52.943 --> 01:05:54.663
We are, Mother.

01:05:54.663 --> 01:05:56.033
You are missing it.

01:05:56.033 --> 01:06:00.703
Now, to get one like that , it's
very cheap here in the market.

01:06:00.710 --> 01:06:05.091
because I know that it doesn’t cost. So
now if you have to buy any television,

01:06:05.091 --> 01:06:08.662
buy that one, which has got both the, isn’t it?

01:06:08.662 --> 01:06:12.231
I think this Doctor Bhaava has bought one.

01:06:13.687 --> 01:06:16.187
Aaaa?  (unclear). Yes!

01:06:16.187 --> 01:06:17.193
And it cost?

01:06:17.193 --> 01:06:20.683
Three, three hundred, three hundred dollars.

01:06:26.520 --> 01:06:27.944
Yeah!

01:06:27.949 --> 01:06:31.514
I mean, most of the recording
is done by this particular thing.

01:06:32.734 --> 01:06:36.751
So if you buy that now, I mean,
instead of buying anything else.

01:06:37.730 --> 01:06:41.771
Can you? No, is it, is it little bit wet?

01:06:41.767 --> 01:06:44.397
It should be wet.

01:06:44.397 --> 01:06:47.457
Yes, water. Little water on it; that’s all.

01:06:47.477 --> 01:06:49.977
Bring some water on it; that’s all.

01:06:49.977 --> 01:06:55.499
If you buy something like that, then wherever we have
the films, anywhere in the world,

01:06:55.525 --> 01:07:00.189
you can see it. Except for America, everybody can see it.

01:07:02.601 --> 01:07:05.171
A very big problem!

01:07:05.171 --> 01:07:10.761
And to adopt anything from this
one to yours is very difficult.

01:07:10.791 --> 01:07:14.161
But more difficult it is from yours to this.

01:07:15.098 --> 01:07:17.598
Is even more difficult!

01:07:33.787 --> 01:07:36.662
He’s so playful. Let him play,

01:07:36.662 --> 01:07:39.162
let him play.

01:07:50.672 --> 01:07:51.667
He’s feeling shy.

01:07:51.702 --> 01:07:54.202
He's hiding from us.

01:08:01.332 --> 01:08:03.832
Hello, Bhima, I can see you.

01:08:03.832 --> 01:08:06.332
Aaaaaa!

01:08:09.512 --> 01:08:12.650
Are, baba, so much problem.
Just, just a little wet cloth.

01:08:17.033 --> 01:08:22.807
It’s too much. Just have it wet cloth.
She's rubbing. She knows. Just a wee bit.

01:08:22.807 --> 01:08:23.877
Here it is wet.

01:08:23.877 --> 01:08:26.377
Yes, it’s all right. Anything will do.

01:08:26.377 --> 01:08:29.284
Just, just a wee bit it stands.

01:08:29.304 --> 01:08:32.687
It takes out the stain; that’s all.

01:08:32.687 --> 01:08:36.244
It’s a... you see, always there’s a stain with this.

01:08:36.247 --> 01:08:37.024
Clean, ha.

01:08:37.024 --> 01:08:42.857
A bigger cup would be better,
not such a small one.

01:08:42.889 --> 01:08:46.717
You see, normally they use that
small one for the coffee, isn’t it?

01:08:46.717 --> 01:08:49.217
North India, America, I don’t know.

01:08:52.937 --> 01:08:56.316
There, it’s faded, already.

01:09:03.836 --> 01:09:08.776
No, it is, it's there a little bit, already there.

01:09:09.746 --> 01:09:12.246
You can take it out there.

01:09:14.606 --> 01:09:16.217
The stain is there also.

01:09:16.217 --> 01:09:16.887
Aaaa?

01:09:16.887 --> 01:09:19.387
It is a half-cup, like a half-truth.

01:09:19.387 --> 01:09:24.117
But you don’t have it anywhere in
the world, one like that, you see.

01:09:24.117 --> 01:09:27.807
It’s for a coffee after dinner.

01:09:27.812 --> 01:09:29.277
That’s a wee bit.

01:09:29.277 --> 01:09:35.339
But for tea they don’t have it. But you see,
in America you have to accept everything.

01:09:43.586 --> 01:09:46.086
Does soap help?

01:09:46.086 --> 01:09:48.586
No, just water, cold water.

01:09:48.586 --> 01:09:51.086
Yes. Is done, I think.

01:09:51.116 --> 01:09:53.304
One little bit there.

01:09:53.306 --> 01:09:55.806
And a bit there.

01:09:55.806 --> 01:09:59.324
Yes, I think so. He is very good at taking.

01:09:59.327 --> 01:10:03.741
Oh, Danny is another, a real Englishman.

01:10:03.761 --> 01:10:05.741
He is so resourceful; you have no idea.

01:10:05.781 --> 01:10:09.481
Oh, he’s extremely resourceful.

01:10:15.329 --> 01:10:20.393
He is so resourceful man, I have to
come across another person like him.

01:10:20.401 --> 01:10:22.901
He’s like Jeeves, you know.

01:10:24.831 --> 01:10:28.348
Leave it to Jeeves; leave it to Jeeves.

01:10:30.051 --> 01:10:32.551
Extremely resourceful.

01:10:48.544 --> 01:10:51.044
Thank you.

01:10:55.919 --> 01:10:59.530
He’s very straightforward and very resourceful.

01:10:59.563 --> 01:11:00.964
(More tea is offered.)

01:11:00.974 --> 01:11:04.244
Ah, this is a proper cup.

01:11:20.294 --> 01:11:24.274
Ha, that’s it. That’s it, very sweet. Thank you.

01:11:28.924 --> 01:11:31.424
Very good, thank you.

01:11:35.284 --> 01:11:37.784
English put the milk first.

01:11:41.154 --> 01:11:43.654
But that’s not very logical.

01:11:46.994 --> 01:11:50.996
You see, if you put the milk first, then you
don’t know how much milk you need, isn’t it?

01:11:54.443 --> 01:11:57.480
Isn’t it? Not very logical, I think.

01:11:57.480 --> 01:12:03.123
You must put first the tea and then the
milk; you know how much it is to be put.

01:12:09.562 --> 01:12:12.062
But they are competing with you in everything.

01:12:12.062 --> 01:12:17.833
Specially now they have produced a special one thing
in which they have got the highest marks, is punks.

01:12:27.143 --> 01:12:31.346
That’s a good idea to keep the left Agnya
open like that, eh?

01:12:33.072 --> 01:12:35.572
That’s a good idea.
