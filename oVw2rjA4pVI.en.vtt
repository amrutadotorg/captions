00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:11.760
Thing is that, you have to ask for it.
It cannot be forced and it is vital that

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:17.759
we should get it. All other vital things we
have got spontaneously without any trouble

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:28.889
as human-beings but this is another stage.
Say, we have become human-beings from

00:00:28.889 --> 00:00:37.880
amoeba or from say, monkeys but now what we
are going to become - we are going to be

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:52.706
empowered that we can transform people,
that we can nourish the nature, so we because

00:00:52.706 --> 00:01:01.900
of this jump that we have to have in our
awareness and in our strength, we have to

00:01:01.902 --> 00:01:09.882
understand what it is because God has given
us brains to understand and everything is

00:01:09.882 --> 00:01:19.038
logical, absolutely logical. You can judge
for yourself and see for yourself.

00:01:22.988 --> 00:01:28.683
That is the reason why, somebody has to
tell you, decode it and tell you everything

00:01:28.683 --> 00:01:35.313
and then once you know it, you can also
tell others. But it cannot be done in the

00:01:35.313 --> 00:01:40.891
way we have got this human awareness;
It's a much higher awareness about which

00:01:41.908 --> 00:01:47.798
I'm talking and for that, somebody has to
tell you all the subtleties, all the decoding.

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:57.970
But that doesn't mean that it's something
obligatory for you. I personally think,

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.146
there's nothing for Me because whatever I
have, I have, it's nothing great; I don't think it's

00:02:02.146 --> 00:02:06.899
something great, to have something born
with it but it's definitely great for you

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:16.012
to achieve it and that's the thing I respect,
that you have achieved all these powers

00:02:16.012 --> 00:02:29.420
yourself. So, there's no obligation at all,
in no way. So, at the very outset, I've to

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:37.421
tell you there are two conditions we have
to have. The first condition is, that we

00:02:37.421 --> 00:02:45.783
have to forget the past and forgive
ourselves that not to feel guilty at all.

00:02:48.777 --> 00:02:55.727
I mean, it's something like a myth that
we start feeling guilty, as a result we

00:02:55.727 --> 00:03:00.692
catch on this center here - the left side
of the Vishuddhi, as we call it and this

00:03:00.692 --> 00:03:09.646
center when you catch, you can get spondylitis,
you can get paralysis, you can get angina,

00:03:13.507 --> 00:03:18.217
so it is useless to feel guilty. After all
we are human-beings, we are not Gods,

00:03:18.808 --> 00:03:23.678
so if we have done mistakes, what is there
to feel guilty? Let the Kundalini find out

00:03:24.008 --> 00:03:31.088
why should we judge ourselves? That means,
you forget your past, forget your guilts

00:03:31.088 --> 00:03:35.638
and mistakes and everything and you have
to be very pleasantly placed towards yourself

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:41.790
because now you are going to enter into
the Kingdom of God, so you should be very

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:47.928
pleasantly placed towards yourself. You
have to respect, I would say, you have to

00:03:47.928 --> 00:03:54.158
love yourself and know that you are a human
being and have self-confidence that you are

00:03:54.158 --> 00:03:59.534
going to enter into the Kingdom of God.
This is the first condition. The second

00:03:59.534 --> 00:04:06.836
one is, that you have to forgive everyone.
The other day somebody said that to forgive

00:04:06.836 --> 00:04:12.973
others is very difficult. Now, whether you
forgive or you don't forgive, you don't do

00:04:12.973 --> 00:04:18.493
anything. Again logically, you don't do
anything. It's just your idea that you

00:04:18.493 --> 00:04:26.451
don't forgive and when you don't forgive,
you play into the hands which are trying

00:04:26.451 --> 00:04:38.481
to harm you. The people, who are the
ones who have tortured you, are very happy

00:04:38.481 --> 00:04:47.620
while you are the one who is suffering
because you cannot forgive, so you have to

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:55.532
forgive everyone. This is a very, very
important crucial point. As I told you,

00:04:55.532 --> 00:05:02.527
that this cross here, of the optic chiasma,
resides Christ. What He has told us, He has

00:05:02.527 --> 00:05:10.006
given us the greatest weapon, is to forgive
and if you don't forgive, you cannot awaken

00:05:10.006 --> 00:05:16.063
Him and if you cannot awaken Him, there
are two functions - one, is the Kundalini

00:05:16.063 --> 00:05:22.160
has to pass through and He sucks in our
karmas and our conditionings from - you can

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:28.805
see the two balloons there - to open up
the limbic area for us for the Kundalini

00:05:28.805 --> 00:05:35.036
to pass through. So, if you do not
forgive, it's going to be difficult for Me

00:05:35.036 --> 00:05:43.906
because I cannot forgive for you. So please,
these two conditions you have to fulfil.

00:05:48.892 --> 00:05:55.482
I hope it's not too much. Now, we have to
take the help of the Mother Earth, so if

00:05:55.482 --> 00:05:59.678
you could take out the shoes, will be
much better. Just the shoes, not the socks

00:05:59.678 --> 00:06:01.429
but just the shoes.

00:06:15.026 --> 00:06:23.286
Please come in, there's lot of space
here. Yes, just come in. Sit down.

00:06:29.031 --> 00:06:33.151
Modern yoga is very wonderful, I think,
that sitting on the chair you can get your

00:06:33.151 --> 00:06:46.173
realization. You don't have to do all
kinds of asanas. It had to be that way.

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:57.500
Now, please remember, as I told you, there's
left and right side, there are two powers.

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:01.944
The left side power, is the power of
desire - not of pure desire, but desire.

00:07:01.944 --> 00:07:06.906
The right side is the power of action. So,
we have to keep both our feet little away

00:07:06.906 --> 00:07:15.151
from each other. We have to sit comfortably,
not bending too much or putting yourself

00:07:15.151 --> 00:07:24.889
backward too much but just in a straight manner
and put your left hand, towards Me, like this.

00:07:27.592 --> 00:07:34.402
This means that you want your self-realization,
that you desire your self-realization.

00:07:36.101 --> 00:07:40.891
Just like this, very comfortably, please
put your left hand towards Me like this

00:07:41.819 --> 00:07:46.379
and with the right hand, we'll be nourishing
our centers, so right hand you have to put

00:07:46.379 --> 00:07:54.914
on your heart. We work only on the left
hand side. I'll first show you then we'll

00:07:54.914 --> 00:08:03.201
close our eyes and we'll work out the
awakening of the Kundalini. Now in the

00:08:03.201 --> 00:08:12.401
heart resides the Spirit, so first we put
our hand on the Spirit. Then we put our

00:08:12.401 --> 00:08:18.893
hand on the upper portion of our abdomen
on the left hand side. Now this is the

00:08:18.893 --> 00:08:28.799
center of your mastery. That means, by
awakening this center, you get that power

00:08:28.799 --> 00:08:35.681
by which, you can master the art of 
Kundalini awakening. Then you take down

00:08:35.681 --> 00:08:41.516
your hand in the lower portion of your
abdomen and press it hard. This is the

00:08:41.516 --> 00:08:49.575
center of Pure Knowledge. The Pure Knowledge
is that knowledge, that you get out of your

00:08:49.575 --> 00:08:57.634
evolutionary process, which manifests on your
Nervous system, on your Central Nervous System.

00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:13.790
Then again you have to raise your hand in
the upper portion of your abdomen and then

00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:28.555
on your heart again. Then raise your right
hand in the corner of your neck, here,

00:09:30.499 --> 00:09:37.639
neck and your shoulder and turn your head
to your right. This is the center, which I

00:09:37.639 --> 00:09:43.876
told you just now, is completely disturbed
when you feel guilty and, I think today,

00:09:44.715 --> 00:09:51.855
with all of you it has this problem. So
again I'll say, please, please forgive yourself.

00:09:53.743 --> 00:09:59.543
Then, you have to take your right hand on to
your forehead across, like this, and press

00:09:59.543 --> 00:10:06.432
it on both the sides. Put down your head
and press it nicely. This is the center

00:10:07.278 --> 00:10:18.788
for forgiving others. Take back your right
hand on the back side of your head and

00:10:18.992 --> 00:10:27.392
push back your head on it. Let it rest.
Here, for your own satisfaction, without

00:10:27.392 --> 00:10:33.626
counting your mistakes, without feeling
guilty, you have to ask forgiveness from

00:10:33.626 --> 00:10:40.202
the Divine Power, which is All-Pervading.
Now, you have to stretch your hand fully

00:10:40.783 --> 00:10:50.873
and put the center of your palm on top of
the fontanel bone area, which was a soft

00:10:50.873 --> 00:10:56.888
bone in your childhood. Please put it
there exactly, put down your head nicely,

00:10:56.888 --> 00:11:02.831
put down your head. Now, push back your
fingers, as much as you can, put down your head

00:11:02.831 --> 00:11:09.050
and push back your fingers. Now, push your
hand on the scalp nicely, so it gives some

00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:16.096
pressure and now you have to move your
scalp very slowly, clockwise, seven times.

00:11:31.107 --> 00:11:37.827
Now, this is all we have to do. You can 
take out your spectacles also - it might

00:11:37.827 --> 00:11:43.879
help your eyesight, so please take out
your spectacles. Now again I repeat, we

00:11:43.879 --> 00:11:52.248
have to be pleasantly placed towards
yourself. Don't feel guilty. We have done

00:11:52.248 --> 00:12:02.975
nothing wrong in the eyes of the Divine.
Please now, put your left hand towards Me

00:12:02.975 --> 00:12:09.923
and right hand on your heart, both the
feet apart and now, close your eyes.

00:12:19.358 --> 00:12:28.208
Here, you have to ask a very fundamental
question to Me. You may call Me Shri Mataji

00:12:28.208 --> 00:12:34.541
or Mother, whatever you like. "Mother, am
I the Spirit?" ask this question three times.

00:12:34.541 --> 00:12:40.307
"Mother, am I the Spirit?" Please ask this
question, three times, in your heart.

00:12:51.725 --> 00:13:00.295
Now, if you are your Spirit, you are your
master, you are your guide. So, take down

00:13:00.295 --> 00:13:04.756
your right hand, in the upper portion of
your abdomen on the left hand side, press

00:13:04.756 --> 00:13:13.289
it hard and here, ask Me another very
fundamental question in your heart,

00:13:14.129 --> 00:13:20.559
"Mother, am I my own master? Mother, am I
my own guru?" Ask this question three times.

00:13:47.064 --> 00:13:56.224
As I've told you, that I respect your
freedom and I cannot force Pure Knowledge

00:13:56.224 --> 00:14:02.715
on you - you have to ask for it. So now, take
down your right hand, in the lower portion

00:14:02.715 --> 00:14:09.303
of your abdomen, press it hard on the left
hand side and here, you please say six times

00:14:09.303 --> 00:14:19.207
because this center has got six petals.
"Mother, please give me Pure Knowledge."

00:14:20.614 --> 00:14:27.104
This Knowledge has to manifest on your Central
Nervous System giving you a new dimension.

00:14:34.956 --> 00:14:46.116
Ask earnestly. As soon as you ask this
question, the Kundalini starts rising.

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:54.470
So now, we have to nourish the upper centers
to open the passage for Kundalaini to rise,

00:14:56.670 --> 00:15:04.760
so now you raise your right hand on to the
upper portion of your abdomen and press it

00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:12.671
hard on the left hand side. Here now with
full confidence, full confidence in yourself,

00:15:13.019 --> 00:15:21.059
please say, "Mother, I am my own master,"
please say it ten times because this center

00:15:21.059 --> 00:15:28.449
has got ten petals. Please say it with full
confidence, "Mother, I am my own master."

00:15:50.167 --> 00:15:59.177
As I have told you in the very beginning,
that the truth is, you are not this body

00:15:59.746 --> 00:16:08.406
and you are not this intellect, you are 
not these emotions and you are not these

00:16:08.406 --> 00:16:16.311
conditionings or this ego - you are the
Pure Spirit. So now, please raise your

00:16:16.311 --> 00:16:22.807
right hand on your heart and say it
again with full confidence, twelve times,

00:16:24.613 --> 00:16:31.783
"Mother, I am the Spirit. Mother, I am
the Spirit." Please say it twelve times.

00:17:00.423 --> 00:17:11.213
The Divine Power, which is All-Pervading,
is the ocean of knowledge and of love.

00:17:14.024 --> 00:17:26.797
It is the ocean of benevolence and blessings
but above all, it is the ocean of forgiveness,

00:17:27.763 --> 00:17:37.373
so, whatever mistakes you might have committed,
this ocean of forgiveness, has a power to

00:17:37.373 --> 00:17:45.470
dissolve everything, so please forgive
yourself. Forgive yourself, be pleasantly

00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:53.801
placed towards yourself and put your right
hand in the corner of your neck and your

00:17:53.801 --> 00:18:01.889
shoulder and turn your head to your right.
Here you have to say with full confidence,

00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:08.800
"Mother, I'm not guilty at all." Please
say it sixteen times because this center

00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:13.549
has got sixteen petals. "Mother,
I'm not guilty at all."

00:18:26.583 --> 00:18:35.963
I've already told you that, whether you
forgive or don't forgive, you don't do anything

00:18:36.591 --> 00:18:45.701
but if you don't forgive then you play 
into wrong hands and suffer. So now, raise

00:18:45.701 --> 00:18:53.126
your right hand on top of your forehead and
put down your head on your hand properly,

00:18:53.148 --> 00:19:01.908
press it on both the sides nicely and say it
from your heart, "Mother, I forgive everyone."

00:19:02.383 --> 00:19:10.223
I'm saying, say it from your heart, not
how many times but say it from your heart,

00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:15.200
"Mother, I forgive everyone."

00:19:27.523 --> 00:19:33.253
Now, take back your hand on the back side
of your head and push back your head on

00:19:33.253 --> 00:19:43.074
that hand, nicely, let it rest. Here, please
again remember, do not count your mistakes,

00:19:44.417 --> 00:19:55.704
do not feel guilty at all but just for your
satisfaction, you push back your head nicely

00:19:55.704 --> 00:20:02.485
and say, "O Divine Power, if I have done
any mistakes knowingly or unknowingly,

00:20:02.485 --> 00:20:05.271
please forgive me."

00:20:22.798 --> 00:20:30.028
Now, please stretch your hand, your palm
fully, put the center of your palm

00:20:30.028 --> 00:20:36.544
on top of your fontanel bone area, which
was the soft bone in your childhood.

00:20:39.115 --> 00:20:46.765
Push back your fingers and press your scalp
nicely. Here again, I cannot cross over

00:20:46.765 --> 00:20:52.640
your freedom, you have to ask for Self
realization. So now, please put down your

00:20:52.640 --> 00:21:01.674
head and press it hard and move it seven
times, your scalp very slowly, with a pressure

00:21:01.674 --> 00:21:06.068
pushing back your fingers and here
you have to say, seven times,

00:21:06.068 --> 00:21:12.684
"Mother, please give me my Self-
realization." Put down your head nicely.

00:21:12.684 --> 00:21:18.129
"Please Mother, give me my
Self-realization," seven times.

00:21:24.622 --> 00:21:27.792
[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MIC]

00:21:28.385 --> 00:21:31.365
[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MIC]

00:21:32.275 --> 00:21:35.945
[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MIC]

00:21:36.258 --> 00:21:39.008
[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MIC]

00:21:40.554 --> 00:21:43.784
[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MIC]

00:21:44.589 --> 00:21:47.429
[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MIC]

00:21:48.352 --> 00:21:50.882
[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MIC]

00:21:52.277 --> 00:21:55.597
[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MIC]

00:21:56.250 --> 00:21:59.820
[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MIC]

00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:07.800
Please take down your hands and open your
eyes. Now, put both your hands towards Me.

00:22:07.996 --> 00:22:17.696
Now try to think. Now watch Me without 
thought - you can do it. You can watch Me

00:22:17.696 --> 00:22:22.936
without thought. This is the first state you
achieve, called as, thoughtless awareness.

00:22:25.342 --> 00:22:33.332
Now, put your right hand like this and
right hand like this and left hand on top

00:22:33.332 --> 00:22:39.035
of your head and put it down your head and
put your right hand and see for yourself -

00:22:39.035 --> 00:22:44.967
not on the head but above the head - and
see for yourself, if there is a cool breeze

00:22:44.967 --> 00:22:50.516
coming out of your head. Put down your
head. Please put your right hand like this.

00:23:01.251 --> 00:23:07.121
Now, please put your left hand towards Me
and put down your head and see for yourself

00:23:08.022 --> 00:23:16.817
is, if there is a cool breeze coming out of
your head - with the right hand you can feel it.

00:23:16.817 --> 00:23:22.713
Now, don't put it on top. You have to put
it above, little away. Some people might

00:23:22.713 --> 00:23:28.732
get hot, heat coming out, that's alright 
and some people might get it far away.

00:23:28.732 --> 00:23:33.318
Doesn't matter, if there's a heat coming
out, is all right - the heat has to come out.

00:23:41.233 --> 00:23:48.823
Hmm, now please put again the right hand,
bend your head again and see for yourself,

00:23:48.823 --> 00:23:59.930
if there's a cool breeze coming out of
your head. [Left Swadhisthan] Now,

00:24:00.670 --> 00:24:08.250
please raise both of your hands like this,
push back your head and ask a question,

00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:13.160
three times, anyone of these, "Mother, is
this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?"

00:24:13.889 --> 00:24:26.219
"Mother, is this the Power of Love of God?"
"Mother, is this the All-Pervading 
Param Chaitanya?"

00:24:26.219 --> 00:24:35.338
Ask anyone of these questions three times.
Now don't doubt because there's

00:24:35.338 --> 00:24:42.868
air conditioning, you may doubt. But
there's nothing to doubt about it. Good.

00:24:44.432 --> 00:24:55.152
Now take down your hands. All those who
have felt, the cool breeze or the heat or

00:24:56.880 --> 00:25:03.590
the cool in their hands, out of their heads
or on their hands, please raise both your hands.

00:25:04.126 --> 00:25:09.616
All those who have felt it - cool breeze
out of your head or in your hands?

00:25:10.421 --> 00:25:22.011
It's very good! May God bless United Nations!
Most of you have felt it, some have not,
doesn't matter.

00:25:22.048 --> 00:25:30.128
It doesn't mean that something wrong
with you but we have a club here -

00:25:30.128 --> 00:25:36.699
Thank God this is being registered. You're
all welcome and we have great experts of

00:25:36.699 --> 00:25:41.679
Sahaja yoga in New York, that's one thing
I must say. We have a great experts of

00:25:41.679 --> 00:25:46.383
Sahaja yoga and they'll tell you each and
everything about it, the whole Knowledge;

00:25:46.383 --> 00:25:51.012
Don't have to pay for it only little bit
time you have to give. These days we have

00:25:51.012 --> 00:25:58.318
watches to save time but we save time to
waste it. We have to save time to use it

00:25:58.318 --> 00:26:04.384
for our ascent and you don't need much time
for this. About 5 minutes in the morning

00:26:04.384 --> 00:26:08.471
and 10 minutes in the evening is more
than sufficient but you must first learn

00:26:08.471 --> 00:26:14.892
and you all must become great masters of
Sahaja Yog. Next time when I come, I hope,

00:26:14.892 --> 00:26:20.093
I'll be able to see lots of people,
who have got realization through Me.

00:26:20.285 --> 00:26:23.105
May God bless you all!
