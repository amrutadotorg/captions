1
00:00:02,563 --> 00:00:05,793
So today is a very, very important day, you know that;

2
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:13,079
because in the history of creation,

3
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:21,211
till the time of Christ, in the human awareness,

4
00:00:21,755 --> 00:00:25,474
only the sense of resurrection was created

5
00:00:25,713 --> 00:00:30,485
– that you can be resurrected or you can be reborn.

6
00:00:31,722 --> 00:00:37,142
That sense came down with them. People recognised it, that

7
00:00:37,437 --> 00:00:41,632
it could happen to all of us, sometime.

8
00:00:41,972 --> 00:00:45,851
But it did not happen.

9
00:00:46,643 --> 00:00:51,849
Actualisation never took place. That was a problem.

10
00:00:52,462 --> 00:00:56,821
And without you entering into the Reality,

11
00:00:57,049 --> 00:01:04,304
whatever one may talk about, it sounds imaginative.

12
00:01:06,258 --> 00:01:09,682
So, one has to jump into the Reality,

13
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:11,667
into the truth.

14
00:01:12,242 --> 00:01:14,583
This never had happened before

15
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:18,809
and, as I have told you that, 
if it had happened to one or two people

16
00:01:18,929 --> 00:01:22,163
it makes no difference at all, to the masses,

17
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:24,265
and nobody accepts it.

18
00:01:24,485 --> 00:01:27,897
And like the small little river flowing in the desert

19
00:01:28,104 --> 00:01:30,247
 it disappears in the thin air.

20
00:01:30,486 --> 00:01:33,284
The truth also, whatever was found out,

21
00:01:33,598 --> 00:01:35,604
never had any roots.

22
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:41,141
And all kinds of funny things started with this reality,

23
00:01:41,281 --> 00:01:44,805
which these people preached.

24
00:01:45,208 --> 00:01:54,905
So it was to be the culmination of human consciousness,

25
00:01:55,561 --> 00:01:59,980
where he becomes one with the Divine.

26
00:02:00,121 --> 00:02:02,342
That he becomes one with himself.

27
00:02:02,482 --> 00:02:05,180
It was to happen.

28
00:02:06,034 --> 00:02:13,521
And that too was to happen at the time,

29
00:02:14,097 --> 00:02:17,866
which was most opportune, the best time.

30
00:02:20,284 --> 00:02:27,338
Because, unless and until the human desire is very strong,

31
00:02:28,113 --> 00:02:36,961
the human will is very strong and is asking for the Reality,

32
00:02:37,616 --> 00:02:40,552
the Reality does not go into action.

33
00:02:43,866 --> 00:02:49,397
Other things, of course, as far as the creation is concerned,

34
00:02:49,517 --> 00:02:57,512
creating the animals and all the trees and the fruits and flowers,

35
00:02:58,128 --> 00:03:00,548
all these things are done.

36
00:03:01,778 --> 00:03:06,858
But the human evolution could not have matured earlier

37
00:03:07,155 --> 00:03:11,200
because there was not so much of seeking.

38
00:03:11,597 --> 00:03:13,898
So when the time came,

39
00:03:18,442 --> 00:03:24,176
when the necessity was so great 
that the necessity itself brought forth Sahaja Yoga.

40
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:34,402
And it happened that I really saw the Sahastrara.

41
00:03:35,473 --> 00:03:40,314
Of course, you know there’s a difference between 
your Sahastrara and mine.

42
00:03:40,474 --> 00:03:49,174
And I saw the Sahastrara, which is the Great Sahastrara, 
opening out beautifully.

43
00:03:49,520 --> 00:04:00,471
And the petals were just like flames,

44
00:04:00,999 --> 00:04:04,975
rounded flames; not like flames but rounded ones:

45
00:04:06,245 --> 00:04:11,024
rounded, beautifully coloured flames, of different colours.

46
00:04:11,143 --> 00:04:16,410
That’s why I wore today a blouse of many 
colours and a sari of many colours.

47
00:04:16,818 --> 00:04:29,151
Because I saw so many permutations and combinations of these. 
It opened out so beautifully.

48
00:04:29,417 --> 00:04:33,529
And as if every petal was individually,

49
00:04:33,695 --> 00:04:38,568
absolutely complete and perfect, but so integrated at the base.

50
00:04:39,144 --> 00:04:43,608
And the way it opened out, and the movement, 
was so rhythmic and so harmonious.

51
00:04:43,906 --> 00:04:47,752
There was no problem. Such a harmony was between them;

52
00:04:47,951 --> 00:04:53,151
no fluctuation anywhere.

53
00:04:54,221 --> 00:04:57,754
As if they were dancing to the tune, they opened out.

54
00:04:58,784 --> 00:05:03,999
And the colours, all spread out their light around the aura.

55
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:10,319
And in the centre I saw the Agnya (inaudible), 
or you can say the Sun colour,

56
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:15,398
and all the chakras from there also emitting light.

57
00:05:16,371 --> 00:05:20,671
But the chakras were darker in shades and they were emitting.

58
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:25,334
So dark that they were all looking blackish, so dark.

59
00:05:25,479 --> 00:05:28,888
Sort of a condensed colour they had.

60
00:05:29,052 --> 00:05:33,630
And they were also emitting light all over.

61
00:05:33,829 --> 00:05:40,158
And the light, as soon as the whole thing opened out, 
the light absolutely spread out,

62
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:46,331
and then I said “It’s done,” it can be done.

63
00:05:47,661 --> 00:05:57,263
So, first I had to open out my Sahastrara itself, 
then your Sahastraras could be opened out.

64
00:05:57,859 --> 00:06:04,701
And then I felt that, a tremendous flow of my grace,

65
00:06:05,257 --> 00:06:12,749
started flowing. So much grace, even upon me.

66
00:06:13,008 --> 00:06:18,920
Like torrential rain on me.

67
00:06:19,258 --> 00:06:24,741
Absolutely I was so drenched in that joy. 
Really I was lost, absolutely lost.

68
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:41,547
I felt that the whole Creation is now resounding 
with that Universal Consciousness.

69
00:06:41,822 --> 00:06:43,409
Just like that.

70
00:06:44,818 --> 00:06:50,529
Everything was finished. Only the joy was permeating.

71
00:06:50,807 --> 00:06:54,120
It was such a beautiful time.

72
00:06:54,756 --> 00:06:57,989
And then I started my work.

73
00:06:58,486 --> 00:07:04,497
But as you know, in the beginning, 
it’s very difficult to talk about these things.

74
00:07:04,934 --> 00:07:11,580
To begin with it is very difficult for a person to say that 
“I am such and such.”

75
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:16,620
It’s a really embarrassing stuff. 
It’s extremely embarrassing to tell someone.

76
00:07:16,938 --> 00:07:21,377
I mean if you have some power, 
or something you feel shy to talk about that.

77
00:07:21,497 --> 00:07:25,187
You just don’t want to stand out and be singled out.

78
00:07:25,451 --> 00:07:31,052
You feel so lonely about it and 
you don’t want to mention it to anyone.

79
00:07:31,179 --> 00:07:33,937
I managed it for quite some time.

80
00:07:34,029 --> 00:07:36,100
But when the Sahastrara opened out,

81
00:07:36,219 --> 00:07:40,008
I knew that I will have to come out in my true colours.

82
00:07:40,068 --> 00:07:47,568
Of course, not yet, I have not yet come out 
because that would be terrible. But, as it is,

83
00:07:47,746 --> 00:07:54,942
when the Sahastrara opened out 
I realised that the instrument is now operative.

84
00:07:57,264 --> 00:08:01,350
So this Instrument that is before

85
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:08,925
you is the Instrument by which you are going to know the truth.

86
00:08:09,149 --> 00:08:13,608
You can find out the truth now, through this Instrument of mine.

87
00:08:15,313 --> 00:08:20,100
Because through this Instrument 
you will get your Kundalini awakened,

88
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,402
you’ll get your Realisation.

89
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:27,521
And through your vibrations you will be able

90
00:08:27,661 --> 00:08:29,505
to know the Truth.

91
00:08:29,585 --> 00:08:36,847
You already know that the rapport between 
you and the Truth has started.

92
00:08:37,046 --> 00:08:41,700
You can ask any question and you get the answer.

93
00:08:46,423 --> 00:08:53,406
So, first of all the Truth will be known,

94
00:08:53,604 --> 00:08:57,176
and that Truth, once you know,

95
00:08:57,296 --> 00:09:02,377
will be followed by another dimension of that Truth

96
00:09:02,516 --> 00:09:06,367
and another dimension. And I knew a stage will be reached

97
00:09:06,485 --> 00:09:11,427
where I will have to give the whole of it.

98
00:09:11,745 --> 00:09:15,046
And the whole of it you have got it.

99
00:09:15,178 --> 00:09:20,224
But this Instrument has a special thing about it,

100
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:27,129
because Sahastrara is, the essence of Sahastrara,

101
00:09:28,419 --> 00:09:32,288
is integration, is ekagrata.

102
00:09:35,863 --> 00:09:38,130
I have told you what is ekagrata:

103
00:09:38,621 --> 00:09:44,870
that is all the holes of all the needles if you put together

104
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:50,905
and thread them together that is called as ‘ekagra’.

105
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:54,808
‘Agra’ means ‘the end’, ‘ek’ means ‘one’.

106
00:09:54,933 --> 00:09:58,697
All the ends are put through one string.

107
00:10:00,206 --> 00:10:02,822
Now what does this means?

108
00:10:03,043 --> 00:10:05,877
In a very subtle way if we understand

109
00:10:06,037 --> 00:10:10,223
that all the chakras are threaded into my Being.

110
00:10:14,429 --> 00:10:18,229
That means all types of patterns that have been created,

111
00:10:24,546 --> 00:10:32,144
all types of religions, all types of faiths, 
all types of ideas, all types of enterprises,

112
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:37,167
science, yogas, everything!

113
00:10:38,177 --> 00:10:41,668
All of them are threaded in this Being.

114
00:10:43,057 --> 00:10:58,519
So supposing you are a hatha yogi, then you have to just 
ask question, “Mother, are you hatha yoga?” finished.

115
00:10:59,621 --> 00:11:07,525
If you are doing Raja Yoga, you just ask, 
“Mother, are you Raja Yoga?”

116
00:11:07,627 --> 00:11:13,080
If you are a Christian, just ask, “Mother, are you Christ?”

117
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:21,657
If you are a Muslim you just ask, “Mother, are you the Prophet?”

118
00:11:22,927 --> 00:11:27,510
Even if you are people who do not believe in God,

119
00:11:27,947 --> 00:11:32,563
[you] say, “Are You the Abstract Image?

120
00:11:33,129 --> 00:11:37,523
Are You Buddha? Are You Mahavira?” All of them are with me.

121
00:11:37,762 --> 00:11:42,761
So that all of you, wherever you may be, 
whatever you might have developed,

122
00:11:42,881 --> 00:11:48,853
nothing is wasted, but is given a proper meaning.

123
00:11:49,369 --> 00:11:54,390
But with that meaning you will be integrated with others also.

124
00:11:54,542 --> 00:11:57,743
Because there’s One Personality, which has all these within.

125
00:11:57,862 --> 00:12:01,972
Like one thousand names of one Goddess.

126
00:12:02,148 --> 00:12:05,047
So automatically they will be integrated.

127
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:08,847
You can be a Hindu, you can be a Muslim, you can be a Christian,

128
00:12:08,975 --> 00:12:12,021
if you want to call yourself something like that.

129
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:17,954
But once you become a Sahaja Yogi you are all integrated.

130
00:12:18,508 --> 00:12:20,908
You can go to Church, if you want to,

131
00:12:21,167 --> 00:12:23,390
you can go to a Mosque if you want to,

132
00:12:23,529 --> 00:12:26,529
but you know who is the person who is there.

133
00:12:26,863 --> 00:12:28,530
Do you follow that point?

134
00:12:28,926 --> 00:12:32,977
This is the essence of Sahastrara.

135
00:12:34,049 --> 00:12:38,158
And for that reason we have to give up our misidentifications.

136
00:12:39,606 --> 00:12:42,424
Like if you say, “I am a Christian,

137
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:48,376
” then how are you a Christian? “I am Church of England,” 
that’s not the way to understand.

138
00:12:48,595 --> 00:12:54,309
You are a Christian, alright, then you are following Christ,

139
00:12:54,409 --> 00:12:57,087
because I am Christ.

140
00:12:58,119 --> 00:13:03,652
If everybody is following one lamppost,

141
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:07,993
you can say, then they are all integrating.

142
00:13:08,357 --> 00:13:12,325
You may seek from one angle another may seek from another angle,

143
00:13:12,517 --> 00:13:17,103
but by this integration you will realise

144
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:20,159
that the Light is the same.

145
00:13:20,318 --> 00:13:25,925
So all these years, the way 
people have been fighting and quarrelling,

146
00:13:26,521 --> 00:13:29,721
all that is going to be absolutely neutralised.

147
00:13:30,349 --> 00:13:33,356
This is the beauty of integration.

148
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:35,375
Anywhere in the world,

149
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:38,500
whatever they are following can be answered.

150
00:13:38,624 --> 00:13:43,274
But supposing its some sort of a falsehood thing like voodoo,

151
00:13:43,691 --> 00:13:47,291
then I am not that. Of course not.

152
00:13:49,789 --> 00:13:51,733
I am not falsehood.

153
00:13:51,912 --> 00:13:53,990
Whatever is the Truth,

154
00:13:54,114 --> 00:13:59,292
whatever you have followed something 
which is called as ‘truth’ – which is called, also.

155
00:13:59,431 --> 00:14:03,360
In the sense, like Christianity is not Truth,

156
00:14:03,667 --> 00:14:05,602
Christ is the Truth.

157
00:14:06,594 --> 00:14:10,165
But if you are a Christian and followed Christ

158
00:14:10,324 --> 00:14:14,629
in a false way, because following 
pope is not following Christ at all.

159
00:14:15,257 --> 00:14:19,344
Or say, becoming a Church of England, 
this thing is not following Christ.

160
00:14:19,464 --> 00:14:24,047
But, if you have been following Christ even through 
Church of England,

161
00:14:24,186 --> 00:14:29,404
it’s alright. Even through pope it’s alright.

162
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:33,967
Because now you have found out the Truth.

163
00:14:38,988 --> 00:14:44,966
So this was a very important and a crucial day 
I would say, the 5th of May.

164
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:49,390
And it all happened very dramatically, extremely dramatically,

165
00:14:49,549 --> 00:14:59,648
that I went to a programme, not a programme, but

166
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:07,265
I went to find out about one of the horrid rakshasas’ places, 
to see what sort of a thing he was about to.

167
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:16,053
And of course I had made my own arrangements 
and I stayed in a friend’s place.

168
00:15:16,212 --> 00:15:20,934
But I went to the camp to see what he was doing, what was he up to;

169
00:15:21,034 --> 00:15:27,119
in a very simple innocent way, he could never 
have guessed that I was up to some mischief!

170
00:15:27,243 --> 00:15:30,802
Extremely simple and innocent.

171
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:33,898
I look so innocent don’t take me for that.

172
00:15:34,116 --> 00:15:40,187
I am very clever! So I went down

173
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:46,140
and the fellow thought me to be a great disciple 
of his and all that. (laughing)

174
00:15:46,259 --> 00:15:49,691
Then I went to the seashore

175
00:15:50,167 --> 00:15:53,314
and I saw what he was up to, I was so angry,

176
00:15:53,474 --> 00:15:59,009
I said, “Now, what is it?” I said, “I must hurry up. 
It has to be done now. It’s no more time needed.

177
00:15:59,148 --> 00:16:01,415
Because just see what is he up to!”

178
00:16:01,554 --> 00:16:07,228
He was working on a chakra which is to be worshipped

179
00:16:07,605 --> 00:16:10,423
and I felt that I must do something about it.

180
00:16:10,561 --> 00:16:17,927
And really it happened, that I could just open out the Sahastrara. 
I said,

181
00:16:18,087 --> 00:16:23,808
“That’s it!” Because as you must’ve heard 
that Goddess has no [purpose].

182
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:27,528
She’s nishprayojana, She’s purposeless, She has no purpose at all.

183
00:16:27,628 --> 00:16:30,008
But, if the purpose comes in Her way,

184
00:16:30,128 --> 00:16:31,695
then She may do something.

185
00:16:31,795 --> 00:16:37,707
But She doesn’t have Her own purpose. 
She’s absolutely purposeless, useless! Without any desire.

186
00:16:37,926 --> 00:16:42,369
Imagine! Without any attributes.

187
00:16:43,183 --> 00:16:45,849
What a thing and a half, whatever it is!

188
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:51,841
Such a personality when It is faced with a demand like that, 
comes up with it’s form.

189
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:58,324
So now you understand from there that, on this Sahastrara day,

190
00:17:00,289 --> 00:17:02,856
you have to also demand.

191
00:17:03,352 --> 00:17:09,542
I want you to demand and ask, because I have no desire.

192
00:17:10,614 --> 00:17:15,315
And you just go ahead! You have all the rights to demand from me.

193
00:17:15,872 --> 00:17:22,655
And ask for the biggest and the highest 
and the most fantastic and the most dynamic

194
00:17:22,854 --> 00:17:25,353
that you want to do.

195
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:29,388
Put up your minds and heads together,

196
00:17:29,719 --> 00:17:32,146
and ask for something big.

197
00:17:32,821 --> 00:17:36,829
This is a very great day today. Go home, think about it.

198
00:17:37,048 --> 00:17:40,956
Collectively also you decide. I’ll go now, so then you decide

199
00:17:41,175 --> 00:17:46,948
and put a demand and it could be done! Now, 
thy will be done, not mine.

200
00:18:34,399 --> 00:18:38,882
So, I will make a move now. I hope all of you will come on the 7th

201
00:18:39,161 --> 00:18:42,077
and bring all your friends and all that.

202
00:18:42,811 --> 00:18:45,152
We might get a big crowd, I can’t say.

203
00:18:45,589 --> 00:18:47,330
But crowd is a crowd.

204
00:18:47,588 --> 00:18:49,417
Sahaja Yogis are Sahaja Yogis.

205
00:18:49,497 --> 00:18:53,485
You might get a big crowd out of which, we put in them in the sea

206
00:18:53,584 --> 00:18:55,489
you’ll find only two remaining back.

207
00:18:55,549 --> 00:18:57,482
So sahaja yogi is different.

208
00:18:57,652 --> 00:19:04,992
We might get a crowd. I don’t know depends on Caxton Hall maybe.

209
00:19:12,491 --> 00:19:14,754
Thanks to Caxton Hall Meeting

210
00:19:14,893 --> 00:19:23,246
that my children have lost all their seats and all their ??

211
00:19:24,278 --> 00:19:28,544
Douglas Fry: I thought something would come of it.
Shri Mataji: Ha ha! You knew that.

212
00:19:28,687 --> 00:19:31,099
Douglas Fry: I knew something funny would happen, it had to!

213
00:19:31,263 --> 00:19:34,478
There is a saying that ‘When the fox has to die,

214
00:19:34,667 --> 00:19:36,005
he runs towards the city.’

215
00:19:36,244 --> 00:19:41,918
Then they told me they are coming to the Caxton Hall I said,

216
00:19:42,176 --> 00:19:44,180
“Very good idea!” You see that’s a very good trap.

217
00:19:44,359 --> 00:19:46,759
And not a single person,

218
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:54,936
all of them lost their vibrations.
Sahaja Yogi: They went down (not clear)

219
00:19:57,086 --> 00:19:59,368
Even that...

220
00:20:01,271 --> 00:20:04,170
You see hatred is not going to work out.

221
00:20:05,618 --> 00:20:10,074
It’s nice, in a way, this lady has also come, lets see,
she’s after all a woman

222
00:20:10,293 --> 00:20:14,293
and we can work on her. Though she’s also with this crowd.

223
00:20:16,078 --> 00:20:19,459
Sahaja Yogi: She has a colossal of ego.
Shri Mataji: She has, for a woman, eh!

224
00:20:24,242 --> 00:20:30,483
She does. I shook hand with her, raised her Kundalini
and with the speed with which it raised I felt wawa!

225
00:20:36,246 --> 00:20:39,192
I’ll raise her Kundalini all right. Don’t say.

226
00:20:39,788 --> 00:20:42,202
Not much hope from her but, you see.

227
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:44,839
We might get a good group.

228
00:20:45,008 --> 00:20:47,170
There’s Lord Hailsham,

229
00:20:47,295 --> 00:20:51,035
I met him in a dinner very, very intimate dinner we had.

230
00:20:51,154 --> 00:20:55,606
Dr. Nagendra Singh was there and he told that
She is a very big spiritual leader of India,

231
00:20:55,753 --> 00:20:57,468
this and that. He said,

232
00:20:57,588 --> 00:21:00,326
“If you want to know anything about Truth,

233
00:21:00,406 --> 00:21:04,872
She’ll be able to tell you”. He said, “I know all about the Truth”.

234
00:21:04,954 --> 00:21:07,536
So he (Dr Singh) asked me, “What do you know about this one?”

235
00:21:07,639 --> 00:21:11,495
I said, “His Kundalini is frozen down below there!”

236
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,815
He was a very proud fellow, you see

237
00:21:13,934 --> 00:21:18,101
– “I know all about Truth!” Imagine to say that!

238
00:21:30,845 --> 00:21:34,428
Rustom: Should I take some vibrations from you?

239
00:21:34,618 --> 00:21:43,299
Lots of it left here. Nabhi, most of you have a left Nabhi….
