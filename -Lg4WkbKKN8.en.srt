1
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,310
So today is a very, very important day, you know that;

2
00:00:11,787 --> 00:00:17,596
because in the history of creation,

3
00:00:18,436 --> 00:00:25,728
till the time of Christ, in the human awareness,

4
00:00:26,272 --> 00:00:29,991
only the sense of resurrection was created

5
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:35,002
– that you can be resurrected or you can be reborn.

6
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:41,659
That sense came down with them. People recognised it, that

7
00:00:41,954 --> 00:00:46,149
it could happen to all of us, sometime.

8
00:00:46,489 --> 00:00:50,368
But it did not happen.

9
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:56,366
Actualisation never took place. That was a problem.

10
00:00:56,979 --> 00:01:01,338
And without you entering into the Reality,

11
00:01:01,566 --> 00:01:08,821
whatever one may talk about, it sounds imaginative.

12
00:01:10,775 --> 00:01:14,199
So, one has to jump into the Reality,

13
00:01:14,577 --> 00:01:16,184
into the truth.

14
00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:19,100
This never had happened before

15
00:01:19,458 --> 00:01:23,326
and, as I have told you that,
if it had happened to one or two people

16
00:01:23,446 --> 00:01:26,680
it makes no difference at all, to the masses,

17
00:01:26,977 --> 00:01:28,782
and nobody accepts it.

18
00:01:29,002 --> 00:01:32,414
And like the small little river flowing in the desert

19
00:01:32,621 --> 00:01:34,764
 it disappears in the thin air.

20
00:01:35,003 --> 00:01:37,801
The truth also, whatever was found out,

21
00:01:38,115 --> 00:01:40,121
never had any roots.

22
00:01:40,797 --> 00:01:45,658
And all kinds of funny things started with this reality,

23
00:01:45,798 --> 00:01:49,322
which these people preached.

24
00:01:49,725 --> 00:01:59,422
So it was to be the culmination of human consciousness,

25
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:04,497
where he becomes one with the Divine.

26
00:02:04,638 --> 00:02:06,859
That he becomes one with himself.

27
00:02:06,999 --> 00:02:09,697
It was to happen.

28
00:02:10,551 --> 00:02:18,038
And that too was to happen at the time,

29
00:02:18,614 --> 00:02:22,383
which was most opportune, the best time.

30
00:02:24,801 --> 00:02:31,855
Because, unless and until the human desire is very strong,

31
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:41,478
the human will is very strong and is asking for the Reality,

32
00:02:42,133 --> 00:02:45,069
the Reality does not go into action.

33
00:02:48,383 --> 00:02:53,914
Other things, of course, as far as the creation is concerned,

34
00:02:54,034 --> 00:03:02,029
creating the animals and all the trees and the fruits and flowers,

35
00:03:02,645 --> 00:03:05,065
all these things are done.

36
00:03:06,295 --> 00:03:11,375
But the human evolution could not have matured earlier

37
00:03:11,672 --> 00:03:15,717
because there was not so much of seeking.

38
00:03:16,114 --> 00:03:18,415
So when the time came,

39
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:28,693
when the necessity was so great
that the necessity itself brought forth Sahaja Yoga.

40
00:03:34,527 --> 00:03:38,919
And it happened that I really saw the Sahastrara.

41
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:44,831
Of course, you know there’s a difference between
your Sahastrara and mine.

42
00:03:44,991 --> 00:03:53,691
And I saw the Sahastrara, which is the Great Sahastrara,
opening out beautifully.

43
00:03:54,037 --> 00:04:04,988
And the petals were just like flames,

44
00:04:05,516 --> 00:04:09,492
rounded flames; not like flames but rounded ones:

45
00:04:10,762 --> 00:04:15,541
rounded, beautifully coloured flames, of different colours.

46
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:20,927
That’s why I wore today a blouse of many
colours and a sari of many colours.

47
00:04:21,335 --> 00:04:33,668
Because I saw so many permutations and combinations of these.
It opened out so beautifully.

48
00:04:33,934 --> 00:04:38,046
And as if every petal was individually,

49
00:04:38,212 --> 00:04:43,085
absolutely complete and perfect, but so integrated at the base.

50
00:04:43,661 --> 00:04:48,125
And the way it opened out, and the movement,
was so rhythmic and so harmonious.

51
00:04:48,423 --> 00:04:52,269
There was no problem. Such a harmony was between them;

52
00:04:52,468 --> 00:04:57,668
no fluctuation anywhere.

53
00:04:58,738 --> 00:05:02,271
As if they were dancing to the tune, they opened out.

54
00:05:03,301 --> 00:05:08,516
And the colours, all spread out their light around the aura.

55
00:05:08,737 --> 00:05:14,836
And in the centre I saw the Agnya (inaudible),
or you can say the Sun colour,

56
00:05:15,044 --> 00:05:19,915
and all the chakras from there also emitting light.

57
00:05:20,888 --> 00:05:25,188
But the chakras were darker in shades and they were emitting.

58
00:05:25,327 --> 00:05:29,851
So dark that they were all looking blackish, so dark.

59
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:33,405
Sort of a condensed colour they had.

60
00:05:33,569 --> 00:05:38,147
And they were also emitting light all over.

61
00:05:38,346 --> 00:05:44,675
And the light, as soon as the whole thing opened out,
the light absolutely spread out,

62
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:50,848
and then I said “It’s done,” it can be done.

63
00:05:52,178 --> 00:06:01,780
So, first I had to open out my Sahastrara itself,
then your Sahastraras could be opened out.

64
00:06:02,376 --> 00:06:09,218
And then I felt that, a tremendous flow of my grace,

65
00:06:09,774 --> 00:06:17,266
started flowing. So much grace, even upon me.

66
00:06:17,525 --> 00:06:23,437
Like torrential rain on me.

67
00:06:23,775 --> 00:06:29,258
Absolutely I was so drenched in that joy.
Really I was lost, absolutely lost.

68
00:06:30,052 --> 00:06:46,064
I felt that the whole Creation is now resounding
with that Universal Consciousness.

69
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:47,926
Just like that.

70
00:06:49,335 --> 00:06:55,046
Everything was finished. Only the joy was permeating.

71
00:06:55,324 --> 00:06:58,637
It was such a beautiful time.

72
00:06:59,273 --> 00:07:02,506
And then I started my work.

73
00:07:03,003 --> 00:07:09,014
But as you know, in the beginning,
it’s very difficult to talk about these things.

74
00:07:09,451 --> 00:07:16,097
To begin with it is very difficult for a person to say that
“I am such and such.”

75
00:07:16,257 --> 00:07:21,137
It’s a really embarrassing stuff.
It’s extremely embarrassing to tell someone.

76
00:07:21,455 --> 00:07:25,894
I mean if you have some power,
or something you feel shy to talk about that.

77
00:07:26,014 --> 00:07:29,704
You just don’t want to stand out and be singled out.

78
00:07:29,968 --> 00:07:35,569
You feel so lonely about it and
you don’t want to mention it to anyone.

79
00:07:35,696 --> 00:07:38,454
I managed it for quite some time.

80
00:07:38,546 --> 00:07:40,617
But when the Sahastrara opened out,

81
00:07:40,736 --> 00:07:44,525
I knew that I will have to come out in my true colours.

82
00:07:44,585 --> 00:07:52,085
Of course, not yet, I have not yet come out
because that would be terrible. But, as it is,

83
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:59,459
when the Sahastrara opened out
I realised that the instrument is now operative.

84
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:05,867
So this Instrument that is before

85
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:13,442
you is the Instrument by which you are going to know the truth.

86
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:18,125
You can find out the truth now, through this Instrument of mine.

87
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:24,617
Because through this Instrument
you will get your Kundalini awakened,

88
00:08:24,836 --> 00:08:26,919
you’ll get your Realisation.

89
00:08:27,297 --> 00:08:32,038
And through your vibrations you will be able

90
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,022
to know the Truth.

91
00:08:34,102 --> 00:08:41,364
You already know that the rapport between
you and the Truth has started.

92
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:46,217
You can ask any question and you get the answer.

93
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:57,923
So, first of all the Truth will be known,

94
00:08:58,121 --> 00:09:01,693
and that Truth, once you know,

95
00:09:01,813 --> 00:09:06,894
will be followed by another dimension of that Truth

96
00:09:07,033 --> 00:09:10,884
and another dimension. And I knew a stage will be reached

97
00:09:11,002 --> 00:09:15,944
where I will have to give the whole of it.

98
00:09:16,262 --> 00:09:19,563
And the whole of it you have got it.

99
00:09:19,695 --> 00:09:24,741
But this Instrument has a special thing about it,

100
00:09:25,476 --> 00:09:31,646
because Sahastrara is, the essence of Sahastrara,

101
00:09:32,936 --> 00:09:36,805
is integration, is ekagrata.

102
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,647
I have told you what is ekagrata:

103
00:09:43,138 --> 00:09:49,387
that is all the holes of all the needles if you put together

104
00:09:49,487 --> 00:09:55,422
and thread them together that is called as ‘ekagra’.

105
00:09:55,558 --> 00:09:59,325
‘Agra’ means ‘the end’, ‘ek’ means ‘one’.

106
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:03,214
All the ends are put through one string.

107
00:10:04,723 --> 00:10:07,339
Now what does this means?

108
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:10,394
In a very subtle way if we understand

109
00:10:10,554 --> 00:10:14,740
that all the chakras are threaded into my Being.

110
00:10:18,946 --> 00:10:22,746
That means all types of patterns that have been created,

111
00:10:29,063 --> 00:10:36,661
all types of religions, all types of faiths,
all types of ideas, all types of enterprises,

112
00:10:37,217 --> 00:10:41,684
science, yogas, everything!

113
00:10:42,694 --> 00:10:46,185
All of them are threaded in this Being.

114
00:10:47,574 --> 00:11:03,036
So supposing you are a hatha yogi, then you have to just
ask question, “Mother, are you hatha yoga?” finished.

115
00:11:04,138 --> 00:11:12,042
If you are doing Raja Yoga, you just ask,
“Mother, are you Raja Yoga?”

116
00:11:12,144 --> 00:11:17,597
If you are a Christian, just ask, “Mother, are you Christ?”

117
00:11:19,324 --> 00:11:26,174
If you are a Muslim you just ask, “Mother, are you the Prophet?”

118
00:11:27,444 --> 00:11:32,027
Even if you are people who do not believe in God,

119
00:11:32,464 --> 00:11:37,080
[you] say, “Are You the Abstract Image?

120
00:11:37,646 --> 00:11:42,040
Are You Buddha? Are You Mahavira?” All of them are with me.

121
00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:47,278
So that all of you, wherever you may be,
whatever you might have developed,

122
00:11:47,398 --> 00:11:53,370
nothing is wasted, but is given a proper meaning.

123
00:11:53,886 --> 00:11:58,907
But with that meaning you will be integrated with others also.

124
00:11:59,059 --> 00:12:02,260
Because there’s One Personality, which has all these within.

125
00:12:02,379 --> 00:12:06,489
Like one thousand names of one Goddess.

126
00:12:06,665 --> 00:12:09,564
So automatically they will be integrated.

127
00:12:09,783 --> 00:12:13,364
You can be a Hindu, you can be a Muslim, you can be a Christian,

128
00:12:13,492 --> 00:12:16,538
if you want to call yourself something like that.

129
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:22,471
But once you become a Sahaja Yogi you are all integrated.

130
00:12:23,025 --> 00:12:25,425
You can go to Church, if you want to,

131
00:12:25,684 --> 00:12:27,907
you can go to a Mosque if you want to,

132
00:12:28,046 --> 00:12:31,046
but you know who is the person who is there.

133
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:33,047
Do you follow that point?

134
00:12:33,443 --> 00:12:37,494
This is the essence of Sahastrara.

135
00:12:38,566 --> 00:12:42,675
And for that reason we have to give up our misidentifications.

136
00:12:44,123 --> 00:12:46,941
Like if you say, “I am a Christian,

137
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:52,893
” then how are you a Christian? “I am Church of England,”
that’s not the way to understand.

138
00:12:53,112 --> 00:12:58,826
You are a Christian, alright, then you are following Christ,

139
00:12:58,926 --> 00:13:01,604
because I am Christ.

140
00:13:02,636 --> 00:13:08,169
If everybody is following one lamppost,

141
00:13:09,593 --> 00:13:12,510
you can say, then they are all integrating.

142
00:13:12,874 --> 00:13:16,842
You may seek from one angle another may seek from another angle,

143
00:13:17,034 --> 00:13:21,620
but by this integration you will realise

144
00:13:21,725 --> 00:13:24,676
that the Light is the same.

145
00:13:24,835 --> 00:13:30,442
So all these years, the way
people have been fighting and quarrelling,

146
00:13:31,038 --> 00:13:34,238
all that is going to be absolutely neutralised.

147
00:13:34,866 --> 00:13:37,873
This is the beauty of integration.

148
00:13:38,038 --> 00:13:39,892
Anywhere in the world,

149
00:13:40,017 --> 00:13:43,017
whatever they are following can be answered.

150
00:13:43,141 --> 00:13:47,791
But supposing its some sort of a falsehood thing like voodoo,

151
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:51,808
then I am not that. Of course not.

152
00:13:54,306 --> 00:13:56,250
I am not falsehood.

153
00:13:56,429 --> 00:13:58,507
Whatever is the Truth,

154
00:13:58,631 --> 00:14:03,809
whatever you have followed something
which is called as ‘truth’ – which is called, also.

155
00:14:03,948 --> 00:14:07,877
In the sense, like Christianity is not Truth,

156
00:14:08,184 --> 00:14:10,119
Christ is the Truth.

157
00:14:11,111 --> 00:14:14,682
But if you are a Christian and followed Christ

158
00:14:14,841 --> 00:14:19,146
in a false way, because following
pope is not following Christ at all.

159
00:14:19,774 --> 00:14:23,861
Or say, becoming a Church of England,
this thing is not following Christ.

160
00:14:23,981 --> 00:14:28,564
But, if you have been following Christ even through
Church of England,

161
00:14:28,703 --> 00:14:33,921
it’s alright. Even through pope it’s alright.

162
00:14:34,417 --> 00:14:38,484
Because now you have found out the Truth.

163
00:14:43,505 --> 00:14:49,483
So this was a very important and a crucial day
I would say, the 5th of May.

164
00:14:49,642 --> 00:14:53,907
And it all happened very dramatically, extremely dramatically,

165
00:14:54,066 --> 00:15:04,165
that I went to a programme, not a programme, but

166
00:15:04,582 --> 00:15:11,782
I went to find out about one of the horrid rakshasas’ places,
to see what sort of a thing he was about to.

167
00:15:13,947 --> 00:15:20,570
And of course I had made my own arrangements
and I stayed in a friend’s place.

168
00:15:20,729 --> 00:15:25,451
But I went to the camp to see what he was doing, what was he up to;

169
00:15:25,551 --> 00:15:31,636
in a very simple innocent way, he could never
have guessed that I was up to some mischief!

170
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:35,319
Extremely simple and innocent.

171
00:15:35,427 --> 00:15:38,415
I look so innocent don’t take me for that.

172
00:15:38,633 --> 00:15:44,704
I am very clever! So I went down

173
00:15:44,804 --> 00:15:50,657
and the fellow thought me to be a great disciple
of his and all that. (laughing)

174
00:15:50,776 --> 00:15:54,208
Then I went to the seashore

175
00:15:54,684 --> 00:15:57,831
and I saw what he was up to, I was so angry,

176
00:15:57,991 --> 00:16:03,526
I said, “Now, what is it?” I said, “I must hurry up.
It has to be done now. It’s no more time needed.

177
00:16:03,665 --> 00:16:05,932
Because just see what is he up to!”

178
00:16:06,071 --> 00:16:11,745
He was working on a chakra which is to be worshipped

179
00:16:12,122 --> 00:16:14,940
and I felt that I must do something about it.

180
00:16:15,078 --> 00:16:22,444
And really it happened, that I could just open out the Sahastrara.
I said,

181
00:16:22,604 --> 00:16:28,325
“That’s it!” Because as you must’ve heard
that Goddess has no [purpose].

182
00:16:28,477 --> 00:16:32,045
She’s nishprayojana, She’s purposeless, She has no purpose at all.

183
00:16:32,145 --> 00:16:34,525
But, if the purpose comes in Her way,

184
00:16:34,645 --> 00:16:36,212
then She may do something.

185
00:16:36,312 --> 00:16:42,224
But She doesn’t have Her own purpose.
She’s absolutely purposeless, useless! Without any desire.

186
00:16:42,443 --> 00:16:46,886
Imagine! Without any attributes.

187
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:50,366
What a thing and a half, whatever it is!

188
00:16:50,558 --> 00:16:56,358
Such a personality when It is faced with a demand like that,
comes up with it’s form.

189
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:02,841
So now you understand from there that, on this Sahastrara day,

190
00:17:04,806 --> 00:17:07,373
you have to also demand.

191
00:17:07,869 --> 00:17:14,059
I want you to demand and ask, because I have no desire.

192
00:17:15,131 --> 00:17:19,832
And you just go ahead! You have all the rights to demand from me.

193
00:17:20,389 --> 00:17:27,172
And ask for the biggest and the highest
and the most fantastic and the most dynamic

194
00:17:27,371 --> 00:17:29,870
that you want to do.

195
00:17:30,962 --> 00:17:33,905
Put up your minds and heads together,

196
00:17:34,236 --> 00:17:36,663
and ask for something big.

197
00:17:37,338 --> 00:17:41,346
This is a very great day today. Go home, think about it.

198
00:17:41,565 --> 00:17:45,473
Collectively also you decide. I’ll go now, so then you decide

199
00:17:45,692 --> 00:17:51,465
and put a demand and it could be done! Now,
thy will be done, not mine.

200
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:43,399
So, I will make a move now. I hope all of you will come on the 7th

201
00:18:43,678 --> 00:18:46,594
and bring all your friends and all that.

202
00:18:47,328 --> 00:18:49,669
We might get a big crowd, I can’t say.

203
00:18:50,106 --> 00:18:51,847
But crowd is a crowd.

204
00:18:52,105 --> 00:18:53,934
Sahaja Yogis are Sahaja Yogis.

205
00:18:54,014 --> 00:18:58,002
You might get a big crowd out of which, we put in them in the sea

206
00:18:58,101 --> 00:19:00,006
you’ll find only two remaining back.

207
00:19:00,066 --> 00:19:01,999
So sahaja yogi is different.

208
00:19:02,169 --> 00:19:09,509
We might get a crowd. I don’t know depends on Caxton Hall maybe.

209
00:19:17,008 --> 00:19:19,271
Thanks to Caxton Hall Meeting

210
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:27,763
that my children have lost all their seats and all their ??

211
00:19:28,795 --> 00:19:33,061
Douglas Fry: I thought something would come of it.
Shri Mataji: Ha ha! You knew that.

212
00:19:33,204 --> 00:19:35,616
Douglas Fry: I knew something funny would happen, it had to!

213
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:38,995
There is a saying that ‘When the fox has to die,

214
00:19:39,184 --> 00:19:40,522
he runs towards the city.’

215
00:19:40,761 --> 00:19:46,435
Then they told me they are coming to the Caxton Hall I said,

216
00:19:46,693 --> 00:19:48,697
“Very good idea!” You see that’s a very good trap.

217
00:19:48,876 --> 00:19:51,276
And not a single person,

218
00:19:52,517 --> 00:19:59,453
all of them lost their vibrations.
Sahaja Yogi: They went down (not clear)

219
00:20:01,603 --> 00:20:03,885
Even that...

220
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:08,687
You see hatred is not going to work out.

221
00:20:10,135 --> 00:20:14,591
It’s nice, in a way, this lady has also come, lets see,
she’s after all a woman

222
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:18,810
and we can work on her. Though she’s also with this crowd.

223
00:20:20,595 --> 00:20:23,976
Sahaja Yogi: She has a colossal of ego.
Shri Mataji: She has, for a woman, eh!

224
00:20:28,759 --> 00:20:35,000
She does. I shook hand with her, raised her Kundalini
and with the speed with which it raised I felt wawa!

225
00:20:40,763 --> 00:20:43,709
I’ll raise her Kundalini all right. Don’t say.

226
00:20:44,305 --> 00:20:46,719
Not much hope from her but, you see.

227
00:20:46,858 --> 00:20:49,356
We might get a good group.

228
00:20:49,525 --> 00:20:51,687
There’s Lord Hailsham,

229
00:20:51,812 --> 00:20:55,552
I met him in a dinner very, very intimate dinner we had.

230
00:20:55,671 --> 00:21:00,123
Dr. Nagendra Singh was there and he told that
She is a very big spiritual leader of India,

231
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:01,985
this and that. He said,

232
00:21:02,105 --> 00:21:04,843
“If you want to know anything about Truth,

233
00:21:04,923 --> 00:21:09,389
She’ll be able to tell you”. He said, “I know all about the Truth”.

234
00:21:09,471 --> 00:21:12,053
So he (Dr Singh) asked me, “What do you know about this one?”

235
00:21:12,156 --> 00:21:16,012
I said, “His Kundalini is frozen down below there!”

236
00:21:16,217 --> 00:21:18,332
He was a very proud fellow, you see

237
00:21:18,451 --> 00:21:22,618
– “I know all about Truth!” Imagine to say that!

238
00:21:35,362 --> 00:21:38,945
Rustom: Should I take some vibrations from you?

239
00:21:39,135 --> 00:21:47,816
Lots of it left here. Nabhi, most of you have a left Nabhi….
