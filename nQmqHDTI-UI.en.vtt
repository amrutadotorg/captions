00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:18.250
Today we are going to celebrate the birth of Christ.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.990
At a very crucial time we are doing that,

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:33.160
because there are some anti-Christ

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.700
who have become in charge of the Christian religion

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.120
and are talking against the birth of Christ.

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.830
They have no authority, they are not realized souls,

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.540
they have no idea of the Divine, nothing,

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.870
and they are saying that it is all falsehood

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.580
that She was not a virgin

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.950
and that Christ was not born that way.

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.910
Who told them? Did Gabriel come and told them?

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.330
What right they have got to talk these things?

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.160
So because they are anti-Christ now they have become

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:29.370
in charge of Christianity. Even Pope is like that.

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.990
So in Satya Yuga they will be all exposed,

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.790
have to be exposed. But some people who are here,

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.870
can write to this man to ask, "What is your authority to say?

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.410
Have you felt the allpervading power of God's love?

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:49.620
Have you any divinity in you to challenge Christ like that?"

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:55.700
There must be some incarnations of Paul perhaps.

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:59.080
They cannot understand Divine.

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.330
They don't know what Divine can do.

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:08.500
They have no idea at all, how miraculous it is.

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.750
You all have felt the blessings of the Divine.

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:19.040
You all know that it is a miracle.

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:24.410
Every time there's a miracle produced.

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:31.370
I will narrate one simple example.

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.370
In the Navaratri Puja we had some photographs.

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.250
And behind the photograph some sort of a scene came

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.410
which I was wondering what is this is supposed to be.

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.370
The scene was that

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:53.540
the Surya was

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.580
moving a curtain.

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.290
Eyes of the, there were eyes for the Surya, mouth, nose

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.540
and He was smiling and moving a curtain like that.

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.620
I said, "What is this?

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.910
What this is indicative in the Navaratri Puja?

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.080
But when I went to Moscow, I was surprised,

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.290
that they had painted the background just like this.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.290
Exactly like this there was the background.

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.660
So Navaratri Puja, which took at least one and a half month before,

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.330
the Paramchaitanya painted there.

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.200
It's very remarkable,

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.910
how things work out miraculously.

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:49.870
And there are thousand and one miracles we can talk about.

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:00.160
When we were in the aeroplane, going to Moscow

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.700
they said the temperature is minus twenty.

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.990
We got down, they said it is minus fifteen.

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.830
Next morning they said it is coming down very fast,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.370
is touching about minus twelve.

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.990
And after one day they said it is minus four.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.160
But next day it was plus ten.

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.370
I mean as the time passes,

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.290
it has to be cooler and cooler.

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.620
This time My husband was going to Moscow.

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:35.830
He said, "It's very cold there now, minus twenty".

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.290
He sent word that... I said, "Don't worry, it will put it right".

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.990
He said when he arrived it was only minus two.

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:50.160
So all these things show that all the elements are helping us.

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:55.080
All the

00:04:55.290 --> 00:05:00.950
other problems, minor, big, anything, get solved in no time.

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.790
You are sometimes amazed how things are done.

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:09.580
So then they question, "Then why Christ had to be crucified?

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:14.950
Why could You not save Him from crucifixion?"

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:21.080
He was crucified because that was to be done in His case,

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:23.790
that He had to pass through the Agya,

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.080
He had to establish Himself in Agya,

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:29.990
and the cross, He had to pass through that.

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:35.580
So the message of His Life is never the cross,

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:38.990
but the message is His Resurrection.

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:44.160
He resurrected - that was one of the things He did very great -

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:48.700
so that now you can be resurrected also.

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:51.330
In every incarnation, in the evolution,

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:56.790
every incarnation did something very, very unique.

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:02.120
At the end of it, Christ, did the Resurrection part.

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.950
And He did it because He had to die,

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:10.540
otherwise how can you resurrect yourself?

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:16.290
So there are lots of things which look mythical, which are not.

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:22.410
Tomorrow they'll say that Christ never resurrected Himself.

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:26.910
And actually He died later on in Kashmir.

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.580
There's a proof of it.

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:33.580
But still the people don't want to believe,

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:36.750
and they just wanted to spread Christianity,

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:41.540
because they know that if you have majority of people

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:43.370
then they can rule.

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:46.750
The same trick now is tried by politicians.

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:50.870
But this kind of a majority is not going to bring any solace

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:55.200
or any benevolence for people.

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:59.990
Christ's Mother Herself has been challenged by this man

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.990
and said all kinds of nonsense about Her.

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.990
On the contrary Mohammad Sahib in Quran says

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:08.540
nobody should challenge the chastity

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:11.120
of the Holy Mother, of Christ's Mother.

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:14.450
He has respected,

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:20.660
while there is no respect shown to Mother Mary

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:24.080
in the Bible, no respect. She's called "a woman".

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:25.870
Because of Paul

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:29.080
who was a horrible anti-Christ  who came over,

00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:32.700
who took over Christianity, tried to spread Christianity

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:36.910
and with that what he wanted, to put his own importance.

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:38.450
And he used Peter

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:43.700
who was the worst possible disciple of Christ,

00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:49.910
whom Christ has told that, "Satan will take you over".

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:53.160
So now,

00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:58.290
they are telling people that, "It's impossible, how can it be

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:04.500
that Christ was born to a virgin?"

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:12.450
We  Indians  worship Shri Ganesh.

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:15.830
Shri Ganesh is the same as Christ,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.790
and we believe that the Mother Herself created the Child

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:23.790
without, as a Virgin, as a Gauri.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.080
Not only believe but we, it's our faith.

00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:35.370
While the faith in the West  is all rationality.

00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:38.700
They go on thinking like that

00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:42.200
and they go on producing yarn of falsehood.

00:08:42.410 --> 00:08:43.870
What was the need for newspapers

00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:48.660
to publish this nonsense of this Dharam fellow?

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:51.790
And then he was honored,

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:56.790
honored by the archbishop of Canterbury, who is another anti-Christ.

00:08:56.990 --> 00:09:02.750
He honored him and just after that,

00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:05.830
that church where he was honored,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.700
was completely burned by Vishnumaya.

00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:13.330
She was looming round it for one hour

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:15.370
and then She burn it completely.

00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:18.160
Only the lower portion was left

00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:22.160
because there were also very beautiful paintings, maybe.

00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:24.750
Now the stupid fools are saying

00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:30.790
that,  "it is God's grace on us that they saved us,

00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:35.290
from this Vishnumaya, the lower portion of it".

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:39.290
But way did it burn?

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:43.700
So you have to understand that rationality can never

00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:47.000
make you understand Divinity, can never.

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:50.950
It is so limited, so conditioned, full of ego.

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:52.620
How can the rationality

00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:57.750
tell you what is the truth about Christ's life.

00:09:57.950 --> 00:10:03.620
But we have proof also, scientifically.

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:06.660
So you must be knowing that

00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:09.790
I told them that  if you see from right to the left

00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:12.750
you see a swastika.

00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:15.500
Because of carbon, the way it is made.

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:20.330
If you see the carbon atom, you see a swastika from left to right.

00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:22.910
We have made a big model out of it.

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:26.830
And then you put

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:31.120
it in other way, means you see it from left to the right,

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:34.790
then you see Omkara, no doubt.

00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:40.660
And then you see from down below, you see Alpha and Omega.

00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:46.410
Christ has said it that ,"I am the Alpha and the Omega".

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:50.330
At that time I did know if these symbols were there or not.

00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:55.160
Whatever it is, He did say, "I am the Alpha and the Omega".

00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:57.410
Also it has another meaning

00:10:57.620 --> 00:11:00.580
that "I am the beginning, I am the end".

00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:03.120
But Alpha and Omega

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:07.370
the way He said it, you can see it clearly, symbolically,

00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:10.200
clearly, if you see it from down upward.

00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:14.700
So, the Omkara on one side, swastika on another side

00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:18.540
join together when they ascend and incarnate,

00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:22.700
they become Alpha and Omega.

00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:25.870
But all these doesn't going to the heads of these anti-Christs.

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:28.330
They are all anti-Christ.

00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:32.290
And they can not understand what Divinity can do.

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:36.370
You got your Realization, your second birth

00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:40.000
just sitting here. How did you manage?

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:42.790
How did you get your second birth?

00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:45.790
And the way these people talk

00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:49.580
is definitely for their doom,

00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:53.330
for their complete destruction.

00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:59.370
It's too much of daring, as you know that

00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:05.580
Shri Ganesha is a very powerful

00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:08.040
deity.

00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:11.370
Same Christ.

00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:14.870
He has said, "If you say anything against the Holy Ghost,

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:17.290
I will not tolerate".

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:22.950
And also, against Christ I will not tolerate,

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:24.830
a word even.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.040
Only on that point I'll have to see to it,

00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:33.120
that all these horrible people, should be destroyed completely.

00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:38.410
On this occasion of His birthday we have to realize

00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:44.040
that Christ was born

00:12:44.250 --> 00:12:50.040
from same things as Shri Ganesh.

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:55.290
So He was wisdom, source of wisdom.

00:12:56.040 --> 00:13:00.830
He said few things because they didn't allow him to live long,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.450
at the most three of,

00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:05.250
three and a half years He could lecture to people.

00:13:05.450 --> 00:13:11.450
But whatever He said is so truthful, so correct  and so wise.

00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:14.750
Of course they might have tried to dabble with that

00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:19.160
but still lots of truths are left in the Bible, no doubt about it.

00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:23.870
And His lifetime He spent

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:27.620
in just telling them what is the truth is.

00:13:27.830 --> 00:13:30.620
He is the first one

00:13:30.830 --> 00:13:35.330
who talked so clearly about God.

00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:38.870
On His level we have three other people,

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:42.080
in the area of tapa which is here.

00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:47.450
One is Buddha, another is Mahavira.

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:52.540
Now, both Buddha and Mahavira were born at a time when they saw

00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:57.370
that ritualism is taking place the reality.

00:13:57.580 --> 00:14:01.000
So they said, "We'll not talk of God, Anishwarwad.

00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:06.330
We'll not talk of God". First we'll only talk about the Chaitanya.

00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:07.990
That everybody did.

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:12.540
Even the Guru of Janaka,

00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:16.250
who was Ashtavakra, only talked about the vibrations.

00:14:16.450 --> 00:14:18.200
Even Nanaka did that.

00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:22.790
When Namadeva went down to Punjab,

00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:26.750
He told him, "Don't talk about God, don't talk about Hari,

00:14:26.950 --> 00:14:31.750
better talk about Paramachaitanya, first of all",

00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:35.000
because one can reach only Paramachaitanya to begin with

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:38.910
and then they will say, "Where is God after all"?

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:42.950
But it's only Christ who talked

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:48.790
about God at that time when it was more,

00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:53.910
that they didn't want to talk about God Almighty.

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:58.990
He was a daring person, was never afraid of anything, no doubt.

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:04.080
But His childhood has not been described anywhere,

00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:05.700
which is very sad.

00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:10.120
We have got the beautiful description of Shri Krishna's childhood

00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:12.410
and also Shri Rama's childhood.

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:17.910
Except that once He was in argument with some Pharisees,

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:21.950
and how clever He was,

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:27.200
and they were all flabbergasted at His discretion.

00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:32.370
That's all, nothing more. But later on,

00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:35.580
though that had shown no regard for Mary,

00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:37.200
the people couldn't help it. They said,

00:15:37.410 --> 00:15:39.870
"There has to be some Devi, some Goddess.

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:43.250
How can Christ take birth from Her?"

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:46.290
So they named Her Madonna,

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:50.000
and that's how this Mother Mary was called as Madonna,

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:52.700
means maiden, means virgin.

00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:57.790
And this Madonna was then started occupying

00:15:57.990 --> 00:16:01.950
the place of our churches everywhere,

00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:08.080
and people regarded Her as a, as a Goddess.

00:16:08.370 --> 00:16:11.910
It is the people who said, not in the Bible, not in the Christianity

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:14.660
but the people start calling Her, Madonna,

00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:17.500
and from that Madonna level

00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:22.700
that people starting seeing the Mother

00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:24.790
and the motherhood.

00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:28.200
She was Mahalakshmi, we know that very well

00:16:28.410 --> 00:16:30.950
and we worship Her as Mahalakshmi.

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:35.660
She was Radha. Radha also had a Son

00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:40.040
and He was like an egg

00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:43.790
and a half of the egg was Christ

00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:48.000
and half of the egg was Shri Ganesh.

00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:53.330
But when this Child was born He started crying for His Father.

00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:57.120
Father was Shri Krishna.

00:16:57.910 --> 00:17:01.080
It's in the... if you read Devi Mahatmyam it is there.

00:17:01.290 --> 00:17:04.910
So always He puts His hands like this, towards His Father.

00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:07.990
So one is, as you know, is Shri Krishna's finger,

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:11.870
another is Vishnu's.

00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:15.660
And She was Radha.

00:17:15.870 --> 00:17:20.540
Ra means energy, dha means the one who has sustained the energy.

00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:26.750
And She is the One, who called Him Jesus.

00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:31.330
Actually in the Hebrew it is Yesu

00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:34.700
and also in the - thank God I read Bible in Marathi,

00:17:34.910 --> 00:17:37.200
which was directly translated from Hebrew -

00:17:37.410 --> 00:17:39.370
Yesu is the name.

00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:43.790
Yesu is the name of the Mother of Christ,

00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:46.830
Mother of Shri Krishna.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.910
Yesu, means as we call Her

00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:53.290
Jesu or Yesu from Jesoda or Yeshoda.

00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:58.990
From that She called Him, and Christ word comes from Krishna.

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:03.330
So She call Him Christ

00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:06.990
and Yesu or Jesus.

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:11.540
We too call Yeshoda sometimes Jesu or Yesu.

00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:14.080
So She called Him by that name

00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:20.160
and that is how She put the link for us to understand

00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:24.700
how close He was to Shri Krishna.

00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:31.200
Shri Krisha came only, incarnated only in India

00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:34.620
because He would have been

00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:38.290
too lenient person to be incarnated in America.

00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:44.040
As it is they have no limitations, they have no maryadas,

00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:48.540
they have no idea of dharma, they are very great adharmis.

00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:52.450
So only a person like Christ

00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:58.330
who is absolutely pure, wise,

00:18:58.540 --> 00:19:01.990
and does not believe

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:06.540
in the leela part of Shri Krishna.

00:19:06.790 --> 00:19:10.040
Is Shri Krishna said that is this all leela

00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:15.580
to overcome the strictness of Shri Rama.

00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:18.790
But Christ did not said so

00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:24.500
and despite that, all over wherever Christianity is practiced,

00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:27.500
they think it's all leela, adharma is leela,

00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:30.910
whatever wrong we do is leela, after all, all innocent.

00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:33.790
It's surprising. Their logic is so funny

00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:36.620
I've never been able to understand their logic.

00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:40.410
All self-destructive, nonsensical logic they have.

00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:44.450
So, for us Indians, we should know that we have

00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:48.450
full idea of dharma. We know what is wrong and what is good.

00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:52.330
But more credit I would give to Christians,

00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:58.870
who are from such countries where they have no idea of Kundalini,

00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:01.580
have come up so much

00:20:01.790 --> 00:20:05.950
and have become such great Sahaja Yogis.

00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:08.250
Now is the blessing of God,

00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:12.250
because they were genuine, they were sincere.

00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:17.870
It is Christ who brought them to Sahaja Yoga.

00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:20.830
Without Him it would not have been possible.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.990
Here Shri Ganesha is just a symbol, sort of a thing.

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:28.540
He resides in the stones.

00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:34.250
But there He incarnated and He told people what is dharma is,

00:20:34.450 --> 00:20:38.830
which they are supposed to follow, but they never follow.

00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:44.200
They never follow. They are extremely money oriented people.

00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:50.500
Is very surprising what things they have done in the name of God.

00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:55.040
The most symbolic thing is His birth.

00:20:55.250 --> 00:20:59.250
He was born in a manger,

00:20:59.450 --> 00:21:02.120
just imagine, in a manger,

00:21:02.330 --> 00:21:06.830
full of straws assembled together

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.160
this child was born,

00:21:09.370 --> 00:21:13.870
where there were other animals used to be.

00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:17.990
See the way

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:20.950
this great incarnation took birth.

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:27.040
He was not king, he was not a big rich man,

00:21:27.250 --> 00:21:31.750
He was born as a very poor person

00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:37.910
and in a place which is something very much

00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:41.750
below the human standard.

00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:45.990
This message is, that you don't need palaces,

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:48.870
you don't need huge places to be born,

00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:53.290
you can be born anywhere, if you are a pure Spirit,

00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:54.910
if you are Christ.

00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:58.870
Such a great personality was born like that.

00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:01.790
Now the other way round people go.

00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:06.160
They are extremely money oriented, very materialistic.

00:22:06.370 --> 00:22:08.330
I mean to such a limit

00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:12.120
that you can't understand what  are they up to.

00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:15.790
They are destroying themselves with whatever money they have made,

00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:18.290
they have no sense, they have no proportion.

00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:20.990
This is what is happening in the West,

00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:24.000
and we are trying to follow them also.

00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:27.250
We are trying to follow their destructive methods

00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:31.540
and we are trying to think that we are very advanced.

00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:35.160
Advanced towards doom, that's what they are.

00:22:35.370 --> 00:22:38.330
We have to be very careful with our children,

00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:41.990
with our relations, that we don't go to their dirty things

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:45.410
and take to their dirty ways,

00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:51.200
which they have created in the name of God, in the name of God.

00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:58.500
Now this group that we have here, is quite a large group,

00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:01.700
and we are Sahaja Yogis

00:23:01.910 --> 00:23:03.750
we are all blessed people,

00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:06.450
we know what is Divinity is

00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:09.250
and we know what Christ is.

00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:15.370
Whether you are born Hindu or anything, makes no difference,

00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:17.620
because Christ is universal.

00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:19.250
He's the support of universe,

00:23:19.450 --> 00:23:22.080
that's what is written in Devi Mahatmyam

00:23:22.290 --> 00:23:25.870
ki ("that" in Hindi) He will be the support of the universe.

00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:28.660
So one has to understand

00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:33.620
that we should never ridicule anybody, if he is following Christ

00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:38.500
and that we should worship Him with the same affection,

00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:42.750
with the same devotion, with the same surrendering,

00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:46.200
as we worship Shri Ganesh.

00:23:46.410 --> 00:23:48.790
Because I don't think Christians

00:23:48.990 --> 00:23:53.370
have any faith about Christ, no faith.

00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:56.370
They are, "We believe in Christ, we believe in Christ.

00:23:56.580 --> 00:24:00.660
You cure my father, do this, do that".

00:24:00.990 --> 00:24:05.160
But as Sahaja Yogis' faith works.

00:24:05.410 --> 00:24:08.790
Your faith is an enlightened faith and it works.

00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:12.620
But you must have faith in yourself, in Sahaja Yoga,

00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:15.120
and in the life you are leading.

00:24:15.330 --> 00:24:17.250
Unless and until this happens to you

00:24:17.450 --> 00:24:20.040
you shouldn't call yourself a Sahaja Yogi.

00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:23.750
I see, still there are people on the periphery.

00:24:23.950 --> 00:24:26.200
Then you don't know what to do about it,

00:24:26.410 --> 00:24:29.950
you don't understand in a mental way,

00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:35.040
but you just float into the immense love of God

00:24:35.250 --> 00:24:38.790
and you want to give this love to others.

00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:43.580
But still, materialism becomes subtler with some people.

00:24:43.790 --> 00:24:45.790
They are still materialistic.

00:24:45.990 --> 00:24:47.750
They are materialistic in the sense,

00:24:47.950 --> 00:24:52.990
they still think of earning in a bad way some money or something.

00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:55.450
Maybe, but that is not so common.

00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:57.580
But I feel they are now

00:24:57.790 --> 00:25:01.000
suddenly started getting attached to their children.

00:25:01.250 --> 00:25:04.830
This attachment is very wrong.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.950
You see, children belong to Sahaja Yoga. You have no right on them.

00:25:10.250 --> 00:25:15.540
Because they straight away wanted children to come back home

00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:18.790
and not to come to Ganapatipule.

00:25:18.990 --> 00:25:23.580
Means they are children of Sahaja Yoga.

00:25:23.790 --> 00:25:27.160
They have to come to Ganapatipule, no question.

00:25:27.370 --> 00:25:30.620
But they wanted to take over their children directly.

00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:33.540
Everything is there, directly done.

00:25:33.750 --> 00:25:35.990
Is not, children are not here for that.

00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:39.160
They are here to grow in Sahaja Yoga. If you don't want

00:25:39.370 --> 00:25:41.910
your children to grow in Sahaja Yoga, better take them away.

00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:44.790
But this is not the way to behave arbitrarily,

00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:47.080
to take the children away from the school,

00:25:47.290 --> 00:25:49.200
when everybody is coming to Ganapatipule.

00:25:49.410 --> 00:25:51.620
And I'm sure children don't like it.

00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:54.040
They would love to be here.

00:25:54.250 --> 00:25:57.000
So the materialism in the sense of children,

00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:02.660
also saving money part is working out.

00:26:03.250 --> 00:26:05.950
And this is, something shows the materialism,

00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:11.370
which Christ never, never clung to.

00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:14.750
He never wanted it.

00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:19.660
This one we have to understand.

00:26:19.870 --> 00:26:23.080
To pay respect to Christ the best thing

00:26:23.290 --> 00:26:25.950
is to get out of this materialistic ideas.

00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:29.000
All right, you have materialistic ideas

00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:33.040
as far as I don't say that you don't go to Himalayas,

00:26:33.250 --> 00:26:37.990
I don't say that you go to, you,

00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:39.830
you practice asceticism,

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.120
I don't say take away, give up your children, like Buddha did.

00:26:43.330 --> 00:26:44.910
Nothing of the kind.

00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:49.620
But your detachment should work.

00:26:50.750 --> 00:26:56.040
There's a, say a bird is there, flying over the ocean of water.

00:26:56.250 --> 00:27:01.120
It will never drink the water of the ocean, because it is saltish.

00:27:01.330 --> 00:27:04.500
You are there, you are in this world,

00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:07.580
but you must develop your detachment.

00:27:07.790 --> 00:27:09.990
In the beginning it was all right, "my father is sick",

00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:11.990
"my mother is sick", "my child is like this",

00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:15.330
all this nonsense was all right. But not now.

00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:18.500
Now the speed of Sahaja Yoga is very fast

00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:22.950
and those will be left behind, will be left behind. So be careful.

00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:28.620
Do not get entangled into these materialistic ideas.

00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:34.620
And for Indians especially, they don't like to stay in ashrams.

00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:38.200
Indians want to have their homes, so they can dominate their wives,

00:27:38.410 --> 00:27:42.990
have their special type of food, this, that, and

00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:49.120
work out all their ugly tastes all the time.

00:27:49.790 --> 00:27:52.250
I would say that's must be the reason people must have said

00:27:52.450 --> 00:27:58.450
that Indians must fast, to get rid of their tongues, desires.

00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:05.290
They will, even when fast, think about food, what's the use?

00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:07.620
Christ fasted for forty days

00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:11.370
and Satan asked Him that, "You should give up Your fast

00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:16.040
and do this and do that". He never listened.

00:28:17.910 --> 00:28:22.580
So materialism works out in two types.

00:28:22.910 --> 00:28:27.200
First of all in the West now is the materialism is "my house",

00:28:27.410 --> 00:28:32.080
"my wife", "my children", this that.

00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:36.540
And in the East is, "what sort of a food I eat",

00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:39.620
"what sort of a house I should have",

00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:45.080
"what sort of a family I should have?"

00:28:46.410 --> 00:28:49.500
All these things are still lingering.

00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:53.410
As your ascent has become subtler

00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:56.580
they are also becoming subtler and subtler.

00:28:56.790 --> 00:28:58.790
And they are holding you back.

00:28:58.990 --> 00:29:02.790
There are all kinds of things. For example I know of Sahaja Yogis,

00:29:02.990 --> 00:29:07.870
who want to make business out of Sahaja Yoga, there are.

00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:09.870
Like these people here, outside,

00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:12.830
they want to sell their things to us

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.040
and to make money out of this.

00:29:16.290 --> 00:29:18.450
There was a demand that there were no saris.

00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:22.540
I said, "All right, take saris. But you are not to buy from outside".

00:29:22.750 --> 00:29:24.700
Also they will go to some shop here,

00:29:24.910 --> 00:29:27.910
and have something to drink, or something to eat,

00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:31.120
and then suffer from something.

00:29:31.330 --> 00:29:36.120
What is the need? Can you not control your thirst?

00:29:36.330 --> 00:29:41.120
Can you not control your appetite?

00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:46.160
It's very easy. Did He not do it? Christ did it.

00:29:46.450 --> 00:29:48.410
You have come here to worship Him.

00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:51.580
Try to control these things are very important,

00:29:51.790 --> 00:29:54.580
and once it happens,

00:29:54.830 --> 00:29:57.830
it doesn't matter if you get food, doesn't matter,

00:29:57.990 --> 00:30:01.120
if you don't get some good place to live in.

00:30:01.330 --> 00:30:04.830
You can live anywhere, anywhere.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:09.410
As far as I am concerned, you know that very well.

00:30:09.620 --> 00:30:13.540
I have no demands. I have, I mean My body doesn't demand anything.

00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:17.910
Is such a good body. Never demands.

00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:23.700
And that's why I have seen, that I never feel tired.

00:30:23.910 --> 00:30:29.370
I am here with you and in the same way I am anywhere.

00:30:29.620 --> 00:30:32.450
If you make Me sleep here I can sleep the whole night.

00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:35.990
My body never says anything.

00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:39.910
On the contrary I've seen the experience is very different.

00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:42.160
Once I travelled by train,

00:30:42.370 --> 00:30:45.700
I think from Pune to Hyderabad or something,

00:30:45.910 --> 00:30:47.990
and the train - I was on the wheel -

00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:51.250
and the thing was jumping, jumping, jumping all the time.

00:30:51.450 --> 00:30:53.990
I slept off and what I was feeling,

00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:57.580
that I am going from one star to another star,

00:30:57.790 --> 00:30:59.370
moving from the whole universe.

00:30:59.580 --> 00:31:02.500
I never felt the jump, I felt the other way round,

00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:05.200
that the whole thing is going, the body is moving

00:31:05.410 --> 00:31:07.660
from this star to that star, from there to there.

00:31:07.870 --> 00:31:13.160
I mean somebody would be absolutely angry for a thing like that.

00:31:13.370 --> 00:31:16.200
On the contrary, I was enjoying, nice jumping from here to there

00:31:16.410 --> 00:31:18.500
to go into this star and to that star and

00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:22.910
moving from one place to another. It was very interesting.

00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:25.580
So the reaction is very different.

00:31:25.790 --> 00:31:28.950
Reaction is different. If there is a crisis,

00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:32.620
suddenly I become thoughtless, completely thoughtless.

00:31:32.830 --> 00:31:38.620
And a kind of a tremendous peace starts pouring out of it.

00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:41.620
If there is a crisis.

00:31:41.830 --> 00:31:45.040
And this is what you all can achieve very simply,

00:31:45.250 --> 00:31:48.830
if you get detached.

00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:50.910
See, I have children, I have grandchildren.

00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:52.620
I never telephone to them.

00:31:52.830 --> 00:31:55.990
I'm not bothered. If they telephone, well and good.

00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:58.580
I never telephone to my husband also.

00:31:58.790 --> 00:32:03.040
I always think that it's a waste of time.

00:32:03.250 --> 00:32:05.200
of telephoning here and telephoning...

00:32:05.410 --> 00:32:07.330
I've got all telephones within Myself.

00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:11.250
I know everybody is all right so why to telephone to them.

00:32:11.450 --> 00:32:15.580
But unless and until you develop that kind of status it won't [work].

00:32:15.790 --> 00:32:18.700
Then another thing I've noticed about Sahaja Yogis

00:32:18.910 --> 00:32:20.700
that they become suddenly very violent

00:32:20.910 --> 00:32:24.290
and there are reports that some people were hit.

00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:27.700
That's not being a Sahaja Yogi at all.

00:32:27.910 --> 00:32:31.870
I've never raise My hand against even My own children.

00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:35.660
It's not allowed. Nobody has to raise the hand

00:32:35.910 --> 00:32:38.330
or touch somebody's body to be violent.

00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:42.500
It's absolutely, such a person will fall very deep down,

00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:45.830
into Sahaja Yoga, without doing anything.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.990
You are not to get angry, you are not to shout.

00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:52.540
Nothing of the kind is going to help you.

00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:56.290
You have to be absolutely peaceful, calm, compassionate.

00:32:56.500 --> 00:33:00.990
If there is a wrong type of a man, just tell Me, I'll manage.

00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:05.040
You don't have to handle such situations and misbehave,

00:33:05.250 --> 00:33:09.790
because you are still attached,

00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:12.580
and that attachment will pull you down.

00:33:12.870 --> 00:33:15.790
So be careful, not to be angry.

00:33:15.990 --> 00:33:17.910
Look at Christ!

00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:20.750
He was angry with the people who were selling things

00:33:20.950 --> 00:33:24.080
near the church - you know, that time it was not the church,

00:33:24.330 --> 00:33:26.160
but they called it a tabernacle.

00:33:26.370 --> 00:33:30.160
And He was very angry, that in the temple of God,

00:33:30.370 --> 00:33:32.750
these people are selling things outside,

00:33:32.950 --> 00:33:36.580
and He took a big hunter and hit them hard. But He was Christ.

00:33:36.790 --> 00:33:39.910
But at the same time, when He was crucified,

00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:43.580
He said, "Oh God, My Father, please forgive them,

00:33:43.790 --> 00:33:47.790
because they don't know what they are doing".

00:33:48.410 --> 00:33:52.330
This is what is, one has to understand from Him.

00:33:52.540 --> 00:33:56.160
His character, how forgiving, how loving He was.

00:33:56.370 --> 00:33:58.540
How He looked after the people,

00:33:58.750 --> 00:34:02.330
how He helped people for their emancipation.

00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:06.000
In those days of complete chaos

00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:09.540
and anarchy,

00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:15.700
He stood up and talked about truth and about

00:34:15.990 --> 00:34:21.660
such things like Spirit, like ascent.

00:34:21.870 --> 00:34:23.950
I mean, they were all blind people.

00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:26.950
They didn't know what it was He was talking about.

00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:29.660
And He talked about it.

00:34:29.870 --> 00:34:34.370
There is lot of myths that exist in the Bible,

00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:39.910
and one of them is that when the Resurrection time will come

00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:43.040
your bodies will come out of your graves.

00:34:43.290 --> 00:34:48.080
It is not only with Christianity, but also with the Muslims

00:34:48.290 --> 00:34:51.450
and also for the Jews.

00:34:51.660 --> 00:34:57.000
Now think of it, after so many years, what remains in the,

00:34:57.200 --> 00:35:01.620
in the graves? Few bones.

00:35:01.830 --> 00:35:03.910
And these few bones if they come out,

00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:06.790
how can you give them Realization?

00:35:06.990 --> 00:35:09.450
Think of it. It's a big myth.

00:35:09.660 --> 00:35:12.080
One should understand, logically is not proper.

00:35:12.290 --> 00:35:14.790
So what is the thing is, I must say,

00:35:14.990 --> 00:35:16.950
in Nal-Damyanti Akhiyan (Indian Scripture)

00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:20.000
in Indian philosophy they have given a clear-cut idea,

00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:22.450
that when this Kali Yuga will come,

00:35:22.660 --> 00:35:25.990
so many great seekers who are seeking God

00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:32.160
in the hills and dales, mountains,

00:35:32.410 --> 00:35:34.290
will be born again

00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:37.450
and they will be given their Self Realization.

00:35:37.660 --> 00:35:39.540
Their Kundalini will be awaken.

00:35:39.750 --> 00:35:42.330
This is what is said and that seems to be

00:35:42.580 --> 00:35:45.500
a very logical thing, because we are doing that.

00:35:45.700 --> 00:35:47.790
And today's population growth is also because

00:35:47.990 --> 00:35:49.750
so many have taken birth.

00:35:49.950 --> 00:35:52.790
I don't know how many will get their Self Realization,

00:35:52.990 --> 00:35:54.790
how many they are going to get it.

00:35:54.990 --> 00:35:56.500
But those who have got it

00:35:56.700 --> 00:36:00.540
have to establish themselves, establish themselves.

00:36:00.750 --> 00:36:04.500
And there also I find there's some sort of a very

00:36:04.700 --> 00:36:08.950
subtle type of attachment with people.

00:36:09.620 --> 00:36:13.040
So for the time being I feel

00:36:13.250 --> 00:36:17.620
that you should all surrender yourself to the qualities of Christ,

00:36:17.830 --> 00:36:19.700
which are immense qualities.

00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:22.250
And the greatest is that He cannot tolerate

00:36:22.450 --> 00:36:24.750
anything against the Holy Ghost.

00:36:24.950 --> 00:36:28.370
That is the only time He is going to come out and work it.

00:36:28.580 --> 00:36:32.500
I tell you, if you are a Sahaja Yogi and if you misbehave,

00:36:32.700 --> 00:36:34.870
He allows you to some extent.

00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:37.370
But there's one fellow in America

00:36:37.580 --> 00:36:41.410
wanted to talk to Me on the telephone and discuss about Sahaja Yoga,

00:36:41.620 --> 00:36:44.120
but he found Me a bit too much for him, perhaps,

00:36:44.330 --> 00:36:47.160
and he started talking to Sahaja Yogis and he wouldn't,

00:36:47.370 --> 00:36:49.000
he didn't talk to Me.

00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:52.040
And everybody was very angry. I said, "Forget it".

00:36:52.250 --> 00:36:53.950
The other day I received a message

00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:56.990
that he was doing a program same type

00:36:57.160 --> 00:37:02.250
and he collapsed, because he got paralysis.

00:37:02.830 --> 00:37:06.410
So he is not a Sahaja Yogi. I am not responsible.

00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:10.620
But if somebody calls Me a Mother then

00:37:10.830 --> 00:37:12.830
the Paramchaitanya respects that way.

00:37:12.990 --> 00:37:15.410
And you have no business to hit anybody

00:37:15.620 --> 00:37:18.540
or to talk to anyone rudely, in any manner,

00:37:18.750 --> 00:37:20.250
those who are Sahaja Yogis.

00:37:20.450 --> 00:37:22.620
Of course if you want to tell somebody off

00:37:22.830 --> 00:37:25.620
there are ways how this should be done, like a Sahaja Yoga way

00:37:25.830 --> 00:37:28.250
and not like the violent things.

00:37:28.450 --> 00:37:31.950
It's very, very wrong and I'm very upset to hear that people

00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:36.450
suddenly become violent, even now in Sahaja Yoga.

00:37:38.410 --> 00:37:39.990
This comes from liver, I know.

00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:43.580
You can go in for your liver treatment, improve yourself,

00:37:43.790 --> 00:37:49.200
but don't think that you can get away with it. You cannot.

00:37:49.410 --> 00:37:52.660
Is better such people fast for two days

00:37:52.870 --> 00:37:55.120
and punish themselves.

00:37:55.330 --> 00:37:57.370
Temper is the worst thing

00:37:57.580 --> 00:38:01.790
and Shri Krishna has told that temper is the worst

00:38:01.990 --> 00:38:04.000
from where everything starts.

00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:08.580
So we must control our temper and understand

00:38:08.790 --> 00:38:14.620
that Christ was the embodiment of forgiveness, embodiment.

00:38:14.830 --> 00:38:16.990
We are worshiping Him today.

00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:20.160
How He forgave people?

00:38:20.370 --> 00:38:23.450
Those who crucified were not the Jews actually.

00:38:23.660 --> 00:38:27.450
They were the Romans. The Roman authorities crucified Him.

00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:31.160
But Paul decided that we should try to condemn the Jews,

00:38:31.370 --> 00:38:35.700
"So the Jews have done it". Jews have not done it.

00:38:35.910 --> 00:38:39.580
And they condemned Jews forever.

00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:45.660
With this kind of an attitude people hated Jews,

00:38:45.870 --> 00:38:48.830
and they troubled them and they were tortured.

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:53.910
Then Jews also had a reaction. They are equally the same.

00:38:54.250 --> 00:38:57.000
So is not the Jews, because is never done

00:38:57.200 --> 00:39:00.700
that you ask a multitude, a magistrate asks the multitude,

00:39:00.910 --> 00:39:05.200
whether you should crucify a thief or this man.

00:39:05.410 --> 00:39:08.040
It's never done. They have to take their own decisions.

00:39:08.250 --> 00:39:09.290
This is never done.

00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:14.250
So this is just to bring a curse on the Jews.

00:39:14.580 --> 00:39:17.120
This Paul has done the greatest harm.

00:39:17.330 --> 00:39:20.700
But now, thank God, may we have many Jews and we have

00:39:20.910 --> 00:39:25.370
also a center in Israel, is working out all over.

00:39:25.580 --> 00:39:29.910
We have lots of people from Iran who have come to America,

00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:34.830
who are also Jews and who are also Muslims,

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:37.750
they all have taken to Sahaja Yoga.

00:39:37.950 --> 00:39:40.910
So it is something that's happening

00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:47.040
and also the Sufi people from Turkey I hear, are joining us

00:39:47.250 --> 00:39:52.580
and also Sufi people from India, we'll be able to get them.

00:39:52.830 --> 00:39:57.790
So thus it will work out and it will work out for everybody's good.

00:39:57.990 --> 00:40:02.500
But first of all we should understand how Christ was

00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:06.870
and how His life was and how He loved the world.

00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:11.040
He came on this earth to be crucified.

00:40:11.250 --> 00:40:16.040
He knew He was to be crucified and He did it.

00:40:16.540 --> 00:40:22.540
The way they have given His picture is not correct.

00:40:22.990 --> 00:40:26.990
He was a very healthy, hefty, tall person.

00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:31.040
He had to carry that cross. Those people who paint Him,

00:40:31.250 --> 00:40:34.580
like a Tb patient, should know that they

00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:38.830
if they have to carry the cross, can they do it?

00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:42.200
So all sorts of things they have done

00:40:42.410 --> 00:40:46.080
to harm His personality, to assassinate His character.

00:40:46.290 --> 00:40:48.990
But you being Sahaja Yogis should know about Him,

00:40:49.160 --> 00:40:52.620
and must have full respect, full faith in Him.

00:40:52.830 --> 00:40:54.750
And He is your eldest brother.

00:40:54.950 --> 00:40:59.120
As Shri Ganesha is, He incarnates as your elder brother.

00:40:59.330 --> 00:41:03.500
He's there to look after you in every trouble, in every kind

00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:06.080
of a turmoil.

00:41:06.290 --> 00:41:11.620
He is going to help us in every way, all the time,

00:41:11.830 --> 00:41:17.160
and only way is to surrender, to forgive.

00:41:17.410 --> 00:41:22.330
That is the quality of Christ we have to imbibe.

00:41:22.540 --> 00:41:25.540
May God bless you all!
