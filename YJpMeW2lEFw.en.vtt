1987-1219 Devi Puja Talk, Aurangabad, India

02:18.545 --> 02:26.116
I am sorry, I was dealing with some newspaper people, journalists,

02:26.317 --> 02:31.333
and they came very late, whatever it is.

02:31.542 --> 02:40.472
I found them to be very sensible and very understanding.

03:00.334 --> 03:05.493
All of us have come to Aurangabad now,

03:05.694 --> 03:13.293
and it seems this place is full of vibrations.

03:13.494 --> 03:18.813
Maybe here Shalivahana has ruled in this area,

03:19.014 --> 03:25.773
but also there have been many saints

03:25.974 --> 03:33.773
who were born on this side of Maharashtra,

03:33.974 --> 03:40.533
and they perpetuated Dharma.

03:40.734 --> 03:45.739
They always talked about self-realization.

03:45.940 --> 03:49.893
Dharma gives you the balance.

03:50.094 --> 03:59.413
It gives you the establishment into proper behaviour,

03:59.614 --> 04:07.533
proper understanding, proper living,

04:07.734 --> 04:15.373
but it doesn't give you the completion of your journey.

04:15.574 --> 04:21.973
It doesn't give you the satisfaction of reaching the destination.

04:22.174 --> 04:27.133
And your personality is still incomplete.

04:27.334 --> 04:33.893
So, one has to have the experience of the spirit.

04:34.094 --> 04:39.133
As I was discussing with them today,

04:39.334 --> 04:54.133
I told them that those who do
not have the experience of the spirit

04:54.334 --> 04:59.253
are not only incomplete, but are limited people.

04:59.454 --> 05:02.373
So whatever they see, or whatever they know,

05:02.574 --> 05:08.533
or whatever they criticize, is limited.

05:08.734 --> 05:15.213
As in English we say that "hate the sin and not the sinner".

05:15.414 --> 05:20.933
Like many people who find something wrong
with Christianity start blaming Christ.

05:21.134 --> 05:24.453
Christ did not created Christianity, first of all.

05:24.654 --> 05:30.134
He did not create Christianity.
He did not create Christians.

05:30.334 --> 05:33.414
So there is no relationship between the two.

05:33.614 --> 05:40.254
As you know, recently, they have
found out the books written by Thomas,

05:40.494 --> 05:45.173
the disciple of Christ who was coming to India.

05:45.374 --> 05:51.734
On his way he went to Egypt,
and there he wrote these treatise

05:51.974 --> 05:58.413
and had put them in a big earthen vessel,

05:58.614 --> 06:03.493
or perhaps it was a metallic thing,

06:03.694 --> 06:09.933
and it was discovered fourty-two years back.

06:10.134 --> 06:18.533
The people whom he considers to be

06:18.734 --> 06:23.693
authorized Christians, he calls them as Gnostic.

06:23.894 --> 06:29.893
"Gne", "gne" in Sanskrit language means, "to know".

06:30.094 --> 06:32.214
"Gne" means "to know".

06:32.494 --> 06:41.413
And he has written that to know,
and to have the personal experience

06:41.614 --> 06:47.693
is the only way to follow Christ.
Clearly.

06:47.894 --> 06:54.378
Not only that, it's said that
God Allmighty who is so kind,

06:54.579 --> 06:57.054
why will He ask you to suffer?

06:57.254 --> 07:02.173
So it challenges all the Christian principles of suffering.

07:02.374 --> 07:07.614
In the same way, in all religions,
people have diverted from the right path,

07:07.814 --> 07:12.653
and have come to the wrong path,

07:12.854 --> 07:19.974
and are indulging into self-created religions,

07:20.214 --> 07:25.174
which has no relationship with reality, or with the incarnations,

07:25.374 --> 07:30.133
those who started those religions or
who gave the ideas of the religion.

07:30.334 --> 07:35.854
I hope you won't do that to Me,
because you are gnostic people.

07:36.094 --> 07:43.173
You are the ones who know,
who have had self-realization.

07:43.374 --> 07:48.653
Without self-realization you cannot have a complete personality.

07:48.854 --> 07:51.374
But as you see in Sahaja Yoga,

07:51.574 --> 07:55.854
you don't have to go to Himalayas,
to give up your families;

07:56.094 --> 08:03.053
you don't have to be away from
the society to get your realization.

08:03.254 --> 08:07.414
You get your realization in the circumstances where you are born.

08:07.654 --> 08:11.853
In the same society, in the same family-life.

08:12.054 --> 08:16.013
But, you rise higher then them,

08:16.214 --> 08:22.574
and try to pull them out of the mire in which they are existing.

08:22.774 --> 08:26.014
This mire of ignorance has to be crossed,

08:26.214 --> 08:32.161
and some of you have to do it.

08:32.374 --> 08:36.813
And when you realize that,

08:37.014 --> 08:42.533
then you should know that you all have to be very strong people.

08:42.734 --> 08:45.973
You all have to be extremely strong.

08:46.174 --> 08:51.733
If you are not strong enough, how
can you pull out the rest of them?

08:51.934 --> 08:55.293
People who are mediocre

08:55.494 --> 09:03.813
think that gradually they'll be
allright, and that they'll come up.

09:04.014 --> 09:08.613
But I would suggest that you should make all-out-effort

09:08.814 --> 09:12.293
to become strong Sahaja Yogis.

09:12.494 --> 09:15.973
To become strong Sahaja Yogis is not difficult.

09:16.174 --> 09:19.213
Because you have all the powers within yourselves.

09:19.414 --> 09:21.614
You have the Kundalini within yourselves.

09:21.814 --> 09:27.053
And you know the way, how to become a realized soul.

09:27.254 --> 09:33.654
The problems are of you being dragged into your ego

09:33.854 --> 09:36.094
or into your conditioning.

09:36.294 --> 09:43.020
Only two problems,
not more.

09:43.294 --> 09:46.454
Like somebody asked, "How many turns there are in London?"

09:46.694 --> 09:50.813
Only two, left or right.

09:51.014 --> 09:53.454
So either you go to the left or to the right.

09:53.654 --> 09:56.933
All the permutations and combinations of this left and right

09:57.134 --> 09:59.934
starts working and then you get into trouble.

10:00.134 --> 10:03.093
And then you get into problems.

10:03.294 --> 10:06.534
But actually it is a very simple thing.

10:06.774 --> 10:11.133
To get out of your ego should be the simplest

10:11.334 --> 10:20.733
and that is where you try to understand yourself.

10:20.934 --> 10:25.333
You see yourself. How you are reacting.

10:25.534 --> 10:29.054
Where is your attention? What are you doing?

10:29.254 --> 10:33.333
What is your attitude towards Sahaja Yoga?

10:33.534 --> 10:37.933
So many people think that "this is my house,

10:38.134 --> 10:44.654
this is my family, this is my car, this is my horse, this is my dog.

10:44.854 --> 10:49.013
I don't know how far it goes - "my, my, my, my, my".

10:49.214 --> 10:53.133
But nothing is yours.

10:53.334 --> 10:55.454
Yesterday, as Kabira has said it,

10:55.694 --> 11:02.933
that "some cheat", that is the death, "will come
and take away everything that is not yours".

11:03.134 --> 11:09.574
Then "my family" then "my
children" All this is a nonsense,

11:09.774 --> 11:16.213
and so, when you start getting attached to this word "my",

11:16.414 --> 11:26.093
there where you fail completely into
your own understanding of your ego,

11:26.294 --> 11:32.133
you're completely blinded by this ego.

11:34.454 --> 11:38.213
First of all you should say that "nothing is mine".

11:38.414 --> 11:42.894
Kabira has said that when the goat is living

11:43.134 --> 11:49.773
she goes on saying "Mei, mei, mei "
means "I, I, I " in Hindi language.

11:49.974 --> 11:52.333
he made a pun on the word "my".

11:52.534 --> 11:58.533
And when she dies, and her intestines are taken out,

11:58.734 --> 12:06.933
and are made into something that spins the  cotton,

12:07.134 --> 12:14.014
they go on the street, these people,
telling people that they are around,

12:14.254 --> 12:19.094
they go on playing on that string
which is made from the intestines

12:19.295 --> 12:23.660
of these goats,

12:23.861 --> 12:31.373
it says, "Tuhi, tuhi, tuhi "
meaning "You are, you are, you are "

12:31.574 --> 12:35.053
So one need not be like a goat,

12:35.254 --> 12:38.774
that till you leave you go on saying "I, I, my, my "

12:38.974 --> 12:42.133
When you die then your intestines have to be taken out

12:42.334 --> 12:51.253
and put on that thing just to
make the sound "Tuhi, tuhi, tuhi "

12:51.454 --> 12:57.693
So this sound of "I, I, I " is made
only by egoistical human beings,

12:57.894 --> 13:02.973
but this ego is so much identified with you,

13:03.174 --> 13:10.773
that you think that "I am this ego
and ego is me".

13:10.974 --> 13:18.653
And in that ego you start doing all kinds of nonsensical things.

13:18.854 --> 13:24.854
This ego takes you nowhere,
it takes you nowhere

13:25.054 --> 13:29.174
but into a complete mire of ignorance about yourself.

13:29.374 --> 13:36.534
Ultimately you become stupid, others
can tell you that you are stupid,

13:36.734 --> 13:40.974
or you become idiotic,
or you get a bad name,

13:41.174 --> 13:44.614
and everybody knows that you are doing all wrong things,

13:44.854 --> 13:50.693
but nobody dare tell you, because you
are to be reached with a barge pole.

13:50.894 --> 13:53.334
Such a hot-tempered personality you become,

13:53.534 --> 13:56.894
nobody dare come you and say that this is wrong,

13:57.094 --> 14:01.293
it should not be done, it's stupid, idiotic,

14:01.494 --> 14:07.853
and you, yourself, in that idiocity
and stupidity think no end of yourself.

14:08.054 --> 14:10.853
This is the extreme of your ego.

14:11.054 --> 14:14.813
But it's nice, we have people like Hitler to see.

14:15.014 --> 14:22.494
So if you put Hitler as the ideal egoist
then you will not go on that road.

14:22.694 --> 14:29.733
Because it's a very slippery road
and maybe  one day you land up there.

14:29.934 --> 14:33.433
The second side of ours,
which is a very,

14:33.634 --> 14:40.893
looks very morbid and very mired, is the left side.

14:41.094 --> 14:44.094
The movement on the left side is the emotional side.

14:44.334 --> 14:48.213
You develope habits with the left side.

14:48.414 --> 14:54.813
Now, some people have very dangerous
habits, some have simple habits.

14:55.014 --> 14:59.174
Like I have a bad habit, or a good habit, you may say,

14:59.374 --> 15:01.454
that i must put my right hand under my foot,

15:01.654 --> 15:05.613
because it's all the time working, so I want to controll it.

15:05.814 --> 15:09.694
So, I put it under my head like this, while sleeping

15:09.894 --> 15:13.966
and sometimes under my foot, just to make it little bit stop working,

15:14.167 --> 15:17.174
it works too hard.
Just to give it rest.

15:17.374 --> 15:20.213
So under my pillow I put it and sleep.

15:20.414 --> 15:22.694
But I discovered once, I hurt myself,

15:22.894 --> 15:25.613
that I now cannot put it under my head.

15:25.814 --> 15:28.933
I said, "It's a very funny habbit I have got."

15:29.134 --> 15:35.054
But it's not such a dangerous one. It's
quite good. So I am continuing with it.

15:35.254 --> 15:39.293
But I can get rid of it. It's very simple.

15:39.494 --> 15:44.246
But when I get rid of it
I think the people become overactive

15:44.447 --> 15:47.573
so I put it again, under my pillow.

15:47.774 --> 15:52.853
So as Sahaja Yogis all your habbits should be under your control.

15:53.054 --> 15:59.253
Now the
habits we have formed through drugs,

15:59.454 --> 16:04.374
from drinking, from anything, are very dangerous habbits.

16:04.574 --> 16:11.373
Also, people have their attention being all the time around.

16:11.574 --> 16:16.939
All the time is attention here, there and
there, attracting people, looking after them,

16:17.140 --> 16:21.533
not looking after yourself.

16:21.734 --> 16:26.773
This attention has to be brought under control. Is very important.

16:26.974 --> 16:32.613
That's very simple, that whenever it
happens, you just put down your eyes.

16:32.814 --> 16:36.093
Keep your eyes down.

16:36.294 --> 16:39.819
That's one of the ways we

16:40.020 --> 16:46.893
allow our attentiion to fritter away,
and also our growth becomes stunted.

16:47.094 --> 16:54.293
This is a very very dangerous thing which
in the West specially we have developed.

16:54.494 --> 16:58.973
Here, also, people must read every shop's name.

16:59.174 --> 17:02.294
Indians have a bad habit, because
they have just now started reading,

17:02.494 --> 17:05.414
so they want to read everything that they find, anything.

17:05.614 --> 17:12.374
So on the road if there is a road of
shops, they read every name of every shop,

17:12.614 --> 17:17.773
turn round again and see if they have missed anything.

17:17.974 --> 17:24.173
It sounds stupid. But they all do it.
And all the time they are doing it.

17:24.374 --> 17:31.133
So the attention, wherevever it goes,
has to be under our control.

17:31.334 --> 17:35.453
We have to keep it, all the time under our control.

17:35.654 --> 17:41.814
As Namadeva has said very clearly,
in Guru Grant Sahib has written,

17:42.014 --> 17:49.293
that when a little child is flying the kite,

17:49.494 --> 17:53.654
he's talking  to everyone,
he's playing in a way,

17:53.854 --> 17:59.013
but his attention is on the kite.

17:59.214 --> 18:03.334
And when a housewife is carring her duties,

18:03.534 --> 18:10.453
putting her child on her waiste and working,

18:10.654 --> 18:17.893
then she's doing all kinds of work,
but her attention is on the child.

18:18.094 --> 18:23.774
The Ladies who are carrying three-four
earthen pots on their heads,

18:23.974 --> 18:29.533
water filled up to the brim,

18:29.734 --> 18:34.734
are walking, talking to each other,
having mirth and enjoyment,

18:34.974 --> 18:40.293
but the attention is on the earthen pot, on their heads.

18:40.494 --> 18:43.853
In the same way, whatever adventure you are into,

18:44.054 --> 18:48.933
whatever you are doing, your attention should be on your spirit.

18:49.134 --> 18:53.773
Then everything is under control,
and you can never get enveloped

18:53.974 --> 19:00.309
into anything where attention should not be lost.

19:00.510 --> 19:02.653
So, these two problems we have,

19:02.854 --> 19:07.013
and those problems even after realization people have it.

19:07.214 --> 19:11.213
So please try, when you are not meditating,

19:11.414 --> 19:15.933
to keep your attention on your spirit.

19:16.134 --> 19:22.213
Now, the person who is left-sided or right-sided,

19:22.414 --> 19:27.533
he has developed a mechanism within himself to justify himself.

19:27.734 --> 19:31.334
Through his intellect, or maybe if
they are ladies they have water power,

19:31.534 --> 19:35.693
they'll start crying. And you just
don't know what to say to them.

19:35.894 --> 19:38.686
If you tell them anything, first thing they'll do is to cry,

19:38.887 --> 19:42.933
means sometimes I feel there are thousand arrows on My head

19:43.134 --> 19:46.734
when they start crying. It is
impossible to say anything to them.

19:46.934 --> 19:50.174
And if you talk to some men
the'lll give so many explanations

19:50.374 --> 19:55.573
that you would feel like, just, going off to sleep.

19:55.774 --> 19:59.654
It's so boring. It''s easy to read
some book like "War and Peace"

19:59.854 --> 20:06.701
than to listen to the arguments of such people.

20:07.185 --> 20:13.054
But they don't want to see that
this is all ego, which is talking,

20:13.254 --> 20:17.024
It is not, they are talking,
it is not their spirit.

20:17.225 --> 20:19.374
And if the spirit has to evolve

20:19.574 --> 20:26.413
we have to be extremely wittnessing, in a full way,

20:26.614 --> 20:28.694
very alert, extremely alert

20:28.894 --> 20:31.543
and wittnessing ourselves, what are we doing.

20:31.744 --> 20:38.093
Then only we reach the completion of our realization.

20:38.294 --> 20:42.813
Unless and until you reach the completion of your realization,

20:43.014 --> 20:49.693
you can never be masters of your attention,

20:49.894 --> 20:55.973
and you can never be the enjoyer of your joy,

20:56.174 --> 20:59.653
and you can never know the truth fully.

20:59.854 --> 21:05.213
Achieve this Sat-Chit-Ananda swarupa

21:05.414 --> 21:09.218
you have to be extremely careful about

21:09.419 --> 21:19.413
the instrument that God has given
you, this body, mind and emotions.

21:19.614 --> 21:24.334
You have to keep them in check,
because wherever your habits are

21:24.534 --> 21:28.093
they can never be joy giving, it's a joyless pursuit.

21:28.294 --> 21:34.533
and wherever your ego is, it's a destructive effort.

21:34.734 --> 21:37.654
So both things are detrimental to your growth,

21:37.894 --> 21:43.813
apart from that, they are extremely dangerous thing for yogis.

21:44.014 --> 21:47.054
So, as you are, in whatever conditions you are,

21:47.254 --> 21:56.573
in whatever situations you are,
whatever may be the surroundings,

21:56.774 --> 22:06.053
like a dirty mire full of creatures and filth,

22:06.254 --> 22:09.733
you can become like lotuses.

22:09.934 --> 22:12.573
When you become like lotuses

22:12.762 --> 22:18.396
All that is filth, all that is horrible can become fragrant,

22:18.597 --> 22:20.747
And this is what we have to achieve.

22:21.294 --> 22:25.053
When people will see the lotuses they'll come to you,

22:25.254 --> 22:32.733
not to see the worms and to see
the filth, but to see the lotuses.

22:32.934 --> 22:36.574
So please, this time, correct yourself,

22:36.774 --> 22:41.014
you don't need anybody to correct
you, you just correct yourself,

22:41.214 --> 22:44.214
watch out for yourself, and see for yourself.

22:44.414 --> 22:47.153
If something doesn't work out just give up.

22:47.354 --> 22:52.053
Don't go to extrems for anything.

22:52.254 --> 22:56.534
Must learn to give up at a point
and be happy about it.

22:56.734 --> 23:00.934
If you are contained within yourself,
if your hand is attached to your body,

23:01.134 --> 23:05.183
then you reach up to a point and then leave it, but if it is not attached,

23:05.384 --> 23:09.214
if it is disintegrated then it goes
all round and round and round

23:09.414 --> 23:12.893
and comes back without anything.

23:13.094 --> 23:16.814
That understanding has to be there in you people

23:17.014 --> 23:19.893
because you're standing in the central path,

23:20.094 --> 23:22.861
and you're attached to the central path, not only,

23:23.062 --> 23:25.134
but you are identified with it.

23:25.374 --> 23:27.254
So you cannot go too far to the left,

23:27.454 --> 23:31.374
cannot go too far to the right,
if you do that you get lost.

23:31.574 --> 23:34.214
Then you are no more a Sahaja Yogi,

23:34.454 --> 23:38.454
and then no use having you here artificially or superficially

23:38.654 --> 23:44.173
because it will be hypocrisy.

23:44.374 --> 23:49.351
Whatever is needed to put you back into right frame

23:49.552 --> 23:52.613
you must accept.

23:52.814 --> 23:55.739
And whatever is needed to understand Sahaja Yoga

23:55.940 --> 23:59.853
you have to do. As I have said, please try to learn English language.

24:00.054 --> 24:04.494
I cannot learn fourteen languages.
Very difficult.

24:04.694 --> 24:08.653
It's surprising how I have learned this English language also.

24:08.854 --> 24:13.893
So now to learn fourteen languages
I've to take fourteen Avataras again.

24:14.094 --> 24:18.973
I don't ask you to learn Marathi. Because
that's the best language for Me to speak.

24:19.174 --> 24:21.254
But at least try to learn Engllish.

24:21.454 --> 24:27.068
and then we can see if you can learn Marathi or Hindi.

24:27.269 --> 24:29.744
What is to say now?

24:29.945 --> 24:35.499
that you are born in auspicious place.
this auspicious place Aurangabad,

24:35.700 --> 24:41.299
I feel that ,s very auspicious place.
Great Saints are born here.

24:41.500 --> 24:48.058
Since thousand of years people worked
and gave you these Punyas.

24:48.259 --> 24:52.099
Because of those Punyas you are here today

24:52.300 --> 24:55.589
You behaved well,
respected Dharmas

24:55.790 --> 24:57.971
but not yet reached the Completeness.

24:58.172 --> 25:02.463
Therefore you took Self Realisation.
After getting Self Realisation

25:02.664 --> 25:04.932
we should be able to see our defects.

25:05.133 --> 25:07.297
Otherwise you have not got that light yet.

25:07.498 --> 25:11.259
Now with the Foreigners
they have other defects.

25:11.460 --> 25:13.899
and Indian people have another defects.

25:14.100 --> 25:16.259
And now I see those defects so prominantly

25:16.460 --> 25:19.939
that I feel sometimes better I tell them very clearly.

25:20.140 --> 25:24.180
Actually
for Indians my house

25:24.380 --> 25:31.997
my daughter, my grandson these things
very much and they are so much involved

25:32.220 --> 25:36.724
in the family matters that
they can not come out of it.

25:36.925 --> 25:41.987
I made 4-5 boys marriages and
sent them to Austria.

25:42.188 --> 25:45.420
They had no jobs.
They got nice jobs there.

25:45.621 --> 25:48.021
Immediately they made their own houses

25:48.222 --> 25:51.379
or rather an Indian man can not live without home.

25:51.580 --> 25:54.625
Even having all the facilities in the Ashram they want their separate houses.

25:54.826 --> 25:56.885
Their wives get bored

25:57.086 --> 25:59.340
because to have separate house means to work on your own.

25:59.540 --> 26:05.179
There are no servants, no nothing. After
having Delivery also they work on their own.

26:05.380 --> 26:08.014
Though they are pregnant they have to work on their own.

26:08.215 --> 26:13.058
Husbands will be enjoying outside.
They will have Cars, have Television

26:13.259 --> 26:17.219
and then go everywhere.
After coming home

26:17.420 --> 26:23.099
shout at wives, ‘You did
not cook well, did not do that’.

26:23.300 --> 26:25.819
Wives got bored. What kind of husbands are this?

26:26.020 --> 26:29.364
They can not work everything,
can not clean outside.

26:29.565 --> 26:33.561
Only my house should be neat
and clean and go out for scrolling.

26:33.762 --> 26:39.060
Everyone is the same here. Here
Indian men can not work anything.

26:39.260 --> 26:43.179
They do not use their hands for Work.
All are sophisticated.

26:43.380 --> 26:48.973
We have appointed a Gardner.
Well, he is Gardner. From Austria.

26:49.174 --> 26:53.499
He is also an agriculture
adviser of U.N. He came here.

26:53.700 --> 26:56.140
He takes Spade and Scraper
in hands  and works so hard.

26:56.340 --> 26:59.299
Indian men with hands on Waist
and wearing Gumboots.

26:59.500 --> 27:01.739
I asked," why did you wear Gumboots?"

27:01.940 --> 27:08.339
I have Problems with mud. Is it so?
Then you can go now and be royal.

27:08.540 --> 27:13.620
These things are very much in us.
And speciality of Wives is that

27:13.821 --> 27:17.259
they know well that our husbands
are in our control if the house

27:17.580 --> 27:21.059
is clean and if they get delicious
food. So today this delicious Dish,

27:21.259 --> 27:24.140
tomorrow another delicious Dish
for husband.

27:24.340 --> 27:26.980
Then for the meal they
give you what you like.

27:27.180 --> 27:29.220
So if you like bitter Gourds
then bring the bitter Gourd

27:29.420 --> 27:32.060
at any cost from the Market.
Then cook them for husband.

27:32.260 --> 27:35.660
All the time serve husband.
Whole time after husband.

27:35.861 --> 27:38.288
First thing, due to this husbands get spoiled.

27:38.489 --> 27:41.954
And. Home is something
special, is our thinking,

27:42.155 --> 27:46.740
Our attention does not go
beyond that. That is my, mine.

27:46.941 --> 27:53.808
It becomes so narrow minded
that we get destroyed in this.

27:54.259 --> 27:57.940
This should go away from us If
you are Sahajyogis, became Yogis

27:58.180 --> 28:06.521
wherever they sit, it is your home,
wherever you go it is your home.

28:07.126 --> 28:12.139
do not ask, the family is small. How
that smallness will become gross?

28:12.340 --> 28:15.499
You are born in Yogabhumi of India
because of whatever Punyas

28:15.700 --> 28:21.539
you earned in past Births.
But everything gets destroyed.

28:21.740 --> 28:24.805
That greatness should come.
That greatness does not come and

28:25.006 --> 28:27.539
Some people even say
it is very less in Men.

28:27.740 --> 28:30.539
Now, Now all have written that

28:30.740 --> 28:33.459
we like Indian women but not Indian Men.

28:33.660 --> 28:37.593
Because all are lazy Lumps,
we can see it.

28:37.794 --> 28:40.980
If there is dirt outside the house
they will still walk on it.

28:41.180 --> 28:45.419
But women will keep the house clean.
But women are clever.

28:45.620 --> 28:47.899
If the house is in order then
husband stays at home.

28:48.100 --> 28:53.339
It is very difficult to keep him at
home because he always remains out.

28:53.540 --> 29:00.179
Therefore we have the defect that
we do not have collectiveness in us.

29:00.380 --> 29:05.099
How to become collective,
how to be nice with one another,

29:05.300 --> 29:08.809
how to become compassionate
we do not think this.

29:09.010 --> 29:12.058
Now with the great difficulties
we opened an Ashram in Delhi.

29:12.259 --> 29:15.220
Nobody wants to stay there. Somehow
we sent one couple from Mumbai.

29:15.420 --> 29:19.219
Within 2 days returned back.

29:19.420 --> 29:26.539
The feeling like
my home should be given up.

29:26.740 --> 29:29.780
The day when you will say that
the whole world is my home

29:29.981 --> 29:35.059
then can be said that you have become
great. The mind is so restricted.

29:35.260 --> 29:37.678
How Sahajayogis will do progress.

29:37.879 --> 29:42.059
Though they become Sahajayogis, even they
meditate, do Pujas, everything is OK.

29:42.260 --> 29:44.781
It is past earnings.

29:44.982 --> 29:49.644
But as it is.
No progress  beyond that.

29:49.845 --> 29:53.797
I have found reason for that
is wasting time at home very much.

29:53.998 --> 29:57.630
If you move only in Circle
how will you go further?

29:57.831 --> 30:02.139
We can not get in Collectivity.
So much Selfcentreness.

30:02.340 --> 30:06.940
Increase only Self Esteem.
My home, my wife, my children

30:07.141 --> 30:09.219
this and that.

30:09.420 --> 30:17.901
Until you do not come out of this it is
only load of work. It is just a Donkey-work.

30:18.102 --> 30:22.459
If God is doing everything
then why do you become Donkey?

30:22.660 --> 30:27.899
If you say you do everything
then you became donkey

30:28.100 --> 30:34.259
Like Jesus was sitting on a Donkey
and Donkey was carrying him.

30:34.460 --> 30:38.059
That Donkey thought,
it became Jesus because

30:38.259 --> 30:40.941
everyone was garlanding donkey.

30:41.142 --> 30:45.259
Then Donkey started troubling Jesus. So Jesus
got down of donkey and went somewhere else.

30:45.460 --> 30:50.058
From other side came the Washerman, the master
of donkey. He beated (slapped) donkey nicely.

30:50.259 --> 30:56.693
Then it realised that it itself
is donkey and Jesus is Jesus.

30:56.894 --> 31:00.574
Likewise Yogi is Yogi.
He is not donkey.

31:00.775 --> 31:03.909
Unnecessary donkey-work.
To please wife,

31:04.110 --> 31:08.695
please this person, please that person. There is no need.

31:08.896 --> 31:12.150
In collectivity One should get in collectivity. To get in collectivity

31:12.351 --> 31:16.058
first of all one should give up
all these small small petty things.

31:16.259 --> 31:20.448
Small person sees everything small. Does not see anything gross.

31:20.649 --> 31:24.299
Whatever is small, which is false is always easily accepted.

31:24.500 --> 31:27.002
Therefore we have to make our mind great.

31:27.203 --> 31:29.339
First of all my house these Words should be given up.

31:29.540 --> 31:35.663
Mine, this word is false. What is there in
mine? Like yesterday it was said about Kabira

31:35.864 --> 31:40.259
that one theif came and
robbed me. Means who? Death.

31:40.460 --> 31:43.058
The time when Death comes
everything remains behind.

31:43.259 --> 31:46.380
Then my, mine everything is left
behind. But this Death has come in us

31:46.580 --> 31:50.100
because we have become Sahajayogis
now. Formerly we were Eggs

31:50.300 --> 31:51.660
and now
we have become Birds.

31:51.860 --> 31:54.058
So everything from the past
has been left behind.

31:54.259 --> 31:57.100
Now we have to spread
our Wings and take flights.

31:57.340 --> 32:00.499
But we are still
entangled in our Wings.

32:00.700 --> 32:06.058
What to say now? We are still stuck
up in mud. Which is not correct.

32:06.259 --> 32:11.219
But after this everyone should make his
mind great. Greatness should be adopted.

32:11.420 --> 32:16.379
And this acceptance of greatness
should be enjoyed by everyone.

32:16.580 --> 32:19.985
So many people come here. You
do not speak with them, meet them.

32:20.186 --> 32:23.503
Do not do any introduction with anyone. That is wrong. When these people come

32:23.704 --> 32:26.495
many of you
help them, serve them, agreed.

32:26.696 --> 32:29.219
But you should introduce yourself
with them. Make freindship with them

32:29.420 --> 32:34.060
because they are your brothers and you
do not have any brothers or any sisters.

32:34.260 --> 32:39.016
These are your relatives. It is said that
they are your own near and dear ones.

32:39.217 --> 32:43.219
Gyaneshwara has said clearly that
these are your own Kith and Kin.

32:43.420 --> 32:47.180
these are your own Kith and Kin.
All others are not your relatives.

32:47.380 --> 32:52.019
There is no comparison between you and them.
They say something and do something else.

32:52.220 --> 32:56.190
I can say about my family that some
are in Sahajayoga, they are there.

32:56.391 --> 32:59.459
Those who are not Yogis I do
not know them. They are Strangers.

32:59.660 --> 33:04.259
So those people who are not in Sahajayoga
are not relatives, accept this.

33:04.460 --> 33:07.765
You will be surprised.
Many things will be given up.

33:07.966 --> 33:10.380
Now there is Maratha.
Then Maratha should

33:10.580 --> 33:12.978
marry Maratha. Then it is
OK if he is beating his Wife.

33:13.179 --> 33:16.673
It is OK even if he is not Sahajayogi.
It is OK however way he is treating her.

33:16.874 --> 33:21.559
But Maratha should marry Maratha.
Why?

33:21.760 --> 33:28.019
Tommorrow if that girl is in trouble
then will your Maratha stand by her?

33:28.220 --> 33:30.299
But Sahajayogi will stand by her.

33:30.500 --> 33:36.419
Sahajayogi should marry Sahajayogi
and there if something goes wrong then

33:36.620 --> 33:41.939
Mother we married in Sahajayoga
therfore we got in trouble.

33:42.140 --> 33:48.700
This Cast system or internal hatred
about religion or about another Caste

33:48.901 --> 33:53.330
or for another Country that will
be disappeared only after marrying.

33:53.531 --> 33:57.099
I do not see any other solution.
We can understand by seeing it.

33:57.300 --> 34:00.718
Just few days ago I made one
Maratha girl’s marriage in Australia.

34:00.919 --> 34:04.499
Her family members
made a big issue

34:04.700 --> 34:08.499
and said that they will go to the
Police. I said," Go. Do as you like."

34:08.700 --> 34:11.444
She is an adult now.
She has all the rights.

34:11.645 --> 34:14.100
They did (tried) a lot
but nothing could work out.

34:14.300 --> 34:18.100
Now that girl is very wise
and got married so nicely.

34:18.300 --> 34:21.180
Her husband has a good Salary, etc.
They see this.

34:21.380 --> 34:26.539
Now all of them want to go
to Australia with packings.

34:26.740 --> 34:29.860
At the time of marriage they did stupidity.

34:30.061 --> 34:33.099
Likewise we are Bramhins and marry only with Bramhins

34:33.300 --> 34:36.739
and if tommorrow that Bramhin threw
out of the house, what will you do?

34:36.940 --> 34:40.340
Then you will come to me. Mataji, please
do something about our Son-in-law.

34:40.540 --> 34:43.180
What should I do? You yourself found
such a Bramhin Son-in-law.

34:43.380 --> 34:47.339
Then have it !
Why should I do for that?

34:47.540 --> 34:52.058
Like this many big big
things we are wasting blindly

34:52.259 --> 34:57.058
and all these problems
stood in front of us

34:57.259 --> 35:00.659
because we did not raise our Aim. We are Yogis.

35:00.860 --> 35:04.058
From inside we have become Ascetics Though
from outside we are free from worldly matters,

35:04.259 --> 35:07.059
we have become Ascetics.
You should be proud that

35:07.259 --> 35:10.940
you have become Ascetics
and you should be happy about it.

35:11.141 --> 35:14.259
Otherwise you will not progress,
will never progress.

35:14.540 --> 35:16.837
Whatever you do you will not progress

35:17.038 --> 35:19.629
until you make your mind great.

35:19.830 --> 35:25.139
And we have many misunderstandings
in us those should go away.

35:25.340 --> 35:27.741
No one will be called
as real Yogi

35:27.942 --> 35:30.614
unless all these false ideas go away.

35:30.815 --> 35:35.460
So no one should keep these all kinds
of strange, peculiar things in them.

35:35.700 --> 35:37.894
You will be surprised about what I say.

35:38.095 --> 35:43.139
Before this in this Maharashtra
whichever many great Saints,

35:43.340 --> 35:47.539
Sages took birth.
Very great Saints.

35:47.740 --> 35:52.797
Those Saints and Sages have
told the same thing that Cast system,

35:52.998 --> 35:55.459
Religion-fanticism are very bad things.

35:55.660 --> 35:59.339
Take any Stone and Take any Stone
and put Shendur or Kumkum on it.

35:59.540 --> 36:03.100
It is said that Nrusimha Saraswati
(Freedom fighter) used to spit on it.

36:03.300 --> 36:07.419
If he saw something like that used to spit on it.

36:07.620 --> 36:09.645
He raised his Weapons against them many a times.

36:09.846 --> 36:13.139
But he was alone
and so people troubled him.

36:13.340 --> 36:18.631
Dnyaneswara also suffered a lot. He was
tortured because he was Sanyasi’s son.

36:18.832 --> 36:26.299
Though he was son of Sanyasi,
he was higher than all the Bramhins.

36:26.500 --> 36:28.539
In such a way
many things has happened

36:28.740 --> 36:31.877
happened in our Country. So we should
learn from that history

36:32.078 --> 36:34.854
and now we have become Yogis.
Therefore in such situations

36:35.055 --> 36:40.221
we should behave ourselves so that we
are standing on our Basic Principles.

36:40.422 --> 36:43.882
We have achieved everything. So we
do not belong to those things.

36:44.083 --> 36:48.058
We are only Yogis and these
things do not suit to Yogis.

36:48.259 --> 36:51.717
In such way all the false ideas

36:51.918 --> 36:56.183
or whatever way you had them till today
should be given up

36:56.384 --> 37:01.379
and we should place God in our hearts.

37:01.580 --> 37:05.019
Without being obstinate
all those things should be given up.

37:05.220 --> 37:08.058
Give up completely.
Chokha Mela was also a Saint.

37:08.259 --> 37:12.043
And likewise
Ramdas Swami was also a Saint.

37:12.244 --> 37:15.537
But followers of Ramdas Swami and followers of Chokha Mela

37:15.738 --> 37:19.059
are fighting with each other.
It is a amazing.

37:19.260 --> 37:23.739
If both are Saints why should there be
any fight between them. But it will be.

37:23.940 --> 37:27.729
Because there is no vision
so these things happen.

37:27.930 --> 37:30.459
Therefore
I want to tell you that

37:30.660 --> 37:33.259
We have to come out of this Cast system and stupidity.

37:33.460 --> 37:37.179
In Muslims, in Christianity
it is same thing everywhere.

37:37.380 --> 37:41.163
Though following these Religions
tell me one thing that

37:41.364 --> 37:45.299
have you anywhere seen that man can
not do any Sin because of any Religion?

37:45.500 --> 37:50.195
Ready for all kinds of Sins. Though
he is Muslim, Hindu or Christian.

37:50.396 --> 37:55.499
I have not seen any one
who will not commit any Sin.

37:55.700 --> 37:57.868
But Yogis can not do any Sin.

37:58.069 --> 38:00.693
If they do then Vibrations will go from hands.

38:00.894 --> 38:04.819
Saints never did Sins.
No one had to tell them.

38:05.020 --> 38:08.100
Automatically they became like that.
We should become like that

38:08.300 --> 38:12.620
and achieve
that Stability forever.

38:12.821 --> 38:15.460
Sahajayoga is
a gate of Salvage (Moksha).

38:15.660 --> 38:19.339
So you should feel great
that you came to Sahajayoga.

38:19.540 --> 38:27.219
You should respect yourself and
you should grow in that respect.

38:27.420 --> 38:30.499
Actually we do not have to
sacrifice anything in Sahajayoga.

38:30.700 --> 38:33.539
Yes, but if you give up your Wisdom
then we can not do anything.

38:33.740 --> 38:36.804
But we do not need people who are great Sacrificers.

38:37.005 --> 38:41.140
On the contrary there are only
benefits. Everyone gets benefited

38:41.380 --> 38:46.058
but there is also an illusion.
One should not get lost in that

38:46.259 --> 38:50.259
There are many benefits. You will get
Laxmi’s blessing, shall get good health.

38:50.460 --> 38:54.619
May get various benefits. But it is
an illusion. Beyond that is Spirit.

38:54.820 --> 38:58.940
That we should achieve
and should be dwelling in it.

38:59.141 --> 39:05.059
This I am telling you very clearly and
everyone should give up all the things

39:05.259 --> 39:08.253
of Religions and Religions fanaticism. Likewise

39:08.454 --> 39:12.916
Atheists also should open their Eyes
and see if there God exists or not.

39:13.117 --> 39:16.539
They do not have any authority
to deny God, existence of God.

39:16.740 --> 39:21.164
Who are they to say such things? And
if they say so then they are wrong

39:21.365 --> 39:26.678
because they have not yet seen if God
exists or not. So there should be Purity.

39:26.879 --> 39:34.219
One should make oneself absolute pure.
And in that Purity we should understand

39:34.420 --> 39:38.339
know God. Otherwise
it won’t be understood.

39:38.540 --> 39:41.659
There won’t be oneness, unity
and any benefits ever.

39:41.860 --> 39:44.569
Unnecessarily
we should not come here as we travel

39:44.769 --> 39:47.758
to do pilgrimage to Pandhari.
I request you all that

39:47.958 --> 39:51.539
you should achieve something.
A very sincere request.

39:51.740 --> 39:54.881
I see that here in Maharashtra
apart from lot of hardwork

39:55.081 --> 39:57.057
why Sahajayoga has not deeply established.

39:57.258 --> 40:01.205
Because only by doing my Puja
nothing will happen. What is the use?

40:01.406 --> 40:03.819
You are anyway doing my puja in all Temples.

40:04.020 --> 40:08.419
To do only Puja is useless here. Today
it should be decided and determined

40:08.620 --> 40:13.489
that we are doing Shri Mataji’s puja
keeping all this fanaticism away.

40:13.690 --> 40:16.379
We are doing Shri Mataji’s puja keeping ourself clean.

40:16.580 --> 40:20.724
Then only there will be benefit.
Otherwise I am suffering from Puja.

40:20.925 --> 40:24.584
This is a big authority. And
though I have given you,

40:24.784 --> 40:27.339
you should acquire
that deservence.

40:27.540 --> 40:30.819
And I bless you all !
Many blessings !

40:31.020 --> 40:34.100
Please attention to yourself.
Know your importance !

40:34.300 --> 40:37.300
Know your greatness !
Today which Task you have taken.

40:37.700 --> 40:40.180
I have started this great Work
of Evolution of Universe.

40:40.380 --> 40:43.780
You are standing there
and you should be prepared for that.

40:43.980 --> 40:47.615
Everyone should be strong and ready.
Today is the first Day.

40:47.815 --> 40:52.259
Therefore I say explicitly that
you are

40:52.460 --> 40:55.750
organising whatever to be
done. But I am not doing it

40:55.950 --> 40:59.798
Mother is doing if you think this way
and then

40:59.998 --> 41:02.300
then whatever we are doing
in that

41:02.500 --> 41:05.740
let only Divine Work be manifested
if you desire this

41:05.940 --> 41:08.980
then everything will be fine.
Everything will be fine.

41:09.181 --> 41:14.654
Anyway, I bless you all.
May God bless you all!
