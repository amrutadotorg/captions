1
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:43,780
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

2
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:58,350
At the very outset, I have to tell you that
truth is what it is.

3
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:05,190
You cannot change it; you cannot transform
it; you cannot conceptualize it.

4
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:15,730
It is what it is; it was what it was and it
will be what it will be.

5
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:31,310
Whatever, I want to tell you today, I have
to request you, to keep your mind open, like

6
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:32,430
scientist.

7
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:35,400
You need not believe into what I say.

8
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,840
We have had enough of problems with blind
faith.

9
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:51,660
But keep your minds open in case this proves;
then you have to believe, believe in it.

10
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:55,000
If you are honest people, you have to believe
in it.

11
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:04,860
Because it is for the benevolence of your
individual self, for the benevolence of your

12
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:11,019
city, your country and world at large.

13
00:03:11,019 --> 00:03:18,250
Most of the problems of this world come from
human beings; humbly we must admit.

14
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:25,230
There something wrong somewhere that we create
problems.

15
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:32,290
And these problems come to human beings when
there is a problem with these centres here

16
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:36,370
as explained to you.

17
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:38,320
Now these centres do exist.

18
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,070
These are energy centres within you.

19
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:47,330
And when they are, (Mother speaks aside, Thank
you, (Lawrence?)

20
00:03:47,330 --> 00:04:00,010
thank you, its cold, I don’t like, I like,
just ordinary (glass of water)) these centres,

21
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:12,100
when they go into jeopardy, we have this problem
of human beings behaving in funny manners.

22
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:26,610
When this power, which is within us, which
is in three and a half coils; that’s why

23
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:29,420
it is called as kundalini; “kundalini”
means a coil.

24
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:31,800
It’s a mathematical thing.

25
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:45,320
It rises like a primule in a seed and rises
upward against the gravity, and pierces through

26
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:56,210
your fontanel bone area, which was the soft
bone in your childhood.

27
00:04:56,210 --> 00:05:05,729
(Mother speaks aside, Thank you very much,
(referring to glass of water) thank you)

28
00:05:05,729 --> 00:05:16,949
Now the truth is that you are not this body,
you are not this mind, you are not this ego,

29
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:21,300
you are not these conditionings.

30
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:28,290
What we say, “This is my house, this is
my car, this is my wife, this is my husband,

31
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:36,660
my children” but who is this ‘my’ which
owns it?

32
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:47,180
So that ‘my’ which owns it is the ‘I’
the “self”; is the ‘pure spirit’ within

33
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,630
you.

34
00:05:48,630 --> 00:06:01,990
The second truth is, that there is all-pervading
power of Divine Love, of love, which does

35
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:04,480
all the living work.

36
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:08,820
Now you see beautiful flowers all over since
I’ve come to Australia.

37
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:13,710
I’ve been seeing all kinds of flowers, beautiful
flowers.

38
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:16,010
Who does this miracle?

39
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:19,350
They’re different, of a different shape,
different colour.

40
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:20,350
“Who” does that?

41
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:26,540
Who runs our heart, we never ask this question
to ourselves.

42
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:29,160
We take all living work for granted.

43
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:38,980
We never bother to find out who does that.

44
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:44,940
The third question that should come to us
really, which cannot be answered by anyone:

45
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:48,229
“Why are we on this Earth?

46
00:06:48,229 --> 00:06:54,180
What is our purpose of coming to this Earth,
to be born as human beings, to be evolved

47
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,910
as human beings, what is the purpose?”

48
00:06:56,910 --> 00:07:02,040
Is it just to insure our self and die?

49
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,200
Is that?

50
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,190
What is the purpose of life?

51
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:07,920
What is our identity?

52
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:16,850
And when we start asking these questions,
we find that nobody has been able to answer

53
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:28,310
this question.

54
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:32,070
Science cannot answer this question.

55
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:36,350
Science has its own limitations.

56
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:43,300
So this all-pervading power, which does all
the living work, we have never felt it.

57
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:48,360
We have read it in Scriptures that there is
all-pervading power of God’s love, there’s

58
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,070
the ‘Ruh’, is there.

59
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:56,080
They call it Paramchaitanya or also they say
it is the Cool Breeze of the Holy Ghost.

60
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,640
But where is that?

61
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,830
Nobody has felt it, nobody has known about
it.

62
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:11,370
Another problem is this that our civilizations
grew too big in the West, even in Australia,

63
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:12,370
everywhere.

64
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:19,400
Like a big tree but what about the roots?

65
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:24,490
If you do not find the roots, the result is
as you have now recession; this problem, that

66
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:27,220
problem.

67
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:30,360
So where are the roots?

68
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:37,190
If the knowledge of Science comes from West,
this knowledge comes to you, say from India,

69
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:41,539
or from East, what’s the harm.

70
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:46,950
Because it is important that we should know
our roots.

71
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:52,500
And these are the roots, this is the knowledge
of the roots that is within us.

72
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:58,380
When there is problem outwardly, we should
know there must be some problem inside us

73
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:03,610
and we don’t know anything about ourselves;
nothing.

74
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:06,020
What we know; about outside.

75
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:16,910
But we don’t know what’s wrong with us;
where do we go wrong?

76
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:25,680
So it is very important to understand that
if there is a way of going through the last

77
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:31,320
breakthrough of our evolution, if there’s
a way that we can find out our identity, if

78
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:37,310
there’s a way we can know our inner self
fully, why not do it?

79
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:40,010
For which you don’t have to pay.

80
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:43,620
You can’t pay; it’s an evolutionary process.

81
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,470
It’s a living process!

82
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:51,910
For example, how much do we pay for these
flowers to Mother Earth?

83
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:54,440
Who’s done the job?

84
00:09:54,440 --> 00:10:08,699
It’s built-in in a seed, to germinate and
built-in in the Mother Land that it will germinate.

85
00:10:08,699 --> 00:10:09,820
We don’t pay for that.

86
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,060
It’s already built-in there.

87
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:15,510
In the same way if it is built-in within you,
you can’t pay for it.

88
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:21,670
One thing, if you realize that you can’t
pay for your evolutionary process, for anything

89
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:30,810
that is Divinity, for anything that is pure;
half of the problems will be solved of this

90
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:35,680
guru shopping that you have been doing all
these days.

91
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:43,360
Because if you are not going to pay for it,
and these people are asking for money, that

92
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,990
means something wrong with them!

93
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:47,000
You cannot market it!

94
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:59,050
Thus, we reach a point where we realize that
something spontaneous living process has to

95
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:00,400
take place.

96
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:09,800
And that has become very, very easy in modern
times.

97
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:15,550
Because it is described already, prophesized
in the Bible, it is the Last Judgment and

98
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:19,830
otherwise in the Koran it is “Qiyamah”,
means the Resurrection.

99
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:25,260
Even in Indian scriptures they have described
about these special times when people who

100
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:33,190
will get so much disillusioned in the illusion,
they will be born and they will be disillusioned

101
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:36,480
that they take to reality, and this thing
will happen.

102
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:45,089
It’s already predicted and this is the time,
such a fortunate time when we are all born.

103
00:11:45,089 --> 00:11:48,040
And it has to work out.

104
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,730
It is your own power.

105
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:58,700
It’s your own Mother, it’s your individual
Mother, and She knows everything about you.

106
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,560
It’s all tape-recorded.

107
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,670
And She is anxious to give you this Second
Birth.

108
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:05,890
She is anxious.

109
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:07,670
And She does it very beautifully.

110
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:14,240
I’ve read some books which says that Kundalini
Awakening is very dangerous and all that.

111
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,240
I can’t understand!

112
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,589
It has never happened before like that.

113
00:12:17,589 --> 00:12:24,149
I’ve been working like this for the last,
I think, I don’t know how many years now;

114
00:12:24,149 --> 00:12:30,630
at least twenty-five years and I’ve never
seen anybody being harmed.

115
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:34,460
On the contrary, everybody’s helped; physically,
mentally, emotionally.

116
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:48,210
Now there are three doctors who have got M.D.
in Delhi University for Sahaja Yoga, in various

117
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:49,210
subjects.

118
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:54,339
Now there’s a fourth doctor who is trying
on blood cancer and all that.

119
00:12:54,339 --> 00:12:58,980
For medical science, if you ask them who does
all these things they will say “autonomous

120
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,400
nervous system”.

121
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:05,750
But who is this “auto”, who is this “auto”
that does this work?

122
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:09,840
They can’t answer; they’re honest; they
can’t answer.

123
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:18,610
So this autonomous nervous system, which is
parasympathetic and sympathetic, the parasympathetic

124
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:25,280
nervous system will take over and we can control
our parasympathetic through this.

125
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:33,720
Of course, I don’t know how far the doctors
here are sensitive to a subject like that

126
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,070
but in Russia I was surprised.

127
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:41,360
There are two hundred doctors who are practicing
Sahaja Yoga in Russia.

128
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:46,980
Russian people are not so materialistic because
they have never known materialism much.

129
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:49,680
About 30% of them are funny type.

130
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:56,080
They’ll ask for Marlboro cigarettes but
70% are so sensitive to Sahaja Yoga.

131
00:13:56,080 --> 00:14:02,240
I was amazed the way they took to me and threw
away all absurd gurus from them.

132
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,170
Not one person could prosper.

133
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:11,190
And no religion is allowed to be practiced
there where they have now started taking to

134
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:12,190
Sahaja Yoga.

135
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:19,410
It’s very amazing how these people who don’t
know even English, who don’t know about

136
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:25,520
God; they were not supposed to know about
any religion, they’re so clean, like a clean

137
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:31,080
slate and they have taken to Sahaja in such
a big manner; I’m surprised.

138
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:38,510
In thousands and thousands of people, so sensitive,
so open-minded and scientifically so equipped.

139
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:45,210
There were 300 scientists, I think maybe more,
who invited me.

140
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:50,050
Started telling them about I…I thought,
better start from science.

141
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:53,070
So they said, “Mother, no, don’t tell
us science; we know everything about science.

142
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:55,810
No we don’t, You tell us the science of
God.”

143
00:14:55,810 --> 00:15:05,220
Such eager, intelligent, educated people.

144
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:11,930
Now, this democracy of ours ‘so-called’,
today also in the newspaper.

145
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:16,220
I read the same thing: “so-called democracy”.

146
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:21,670
Because it looks sometimes like a demonocracy
you see, like you go to America; you can’t

147
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:24,840
even wear your wedding ring.

148
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:28,710
They might take away your wedding ring also
and kill you for that.

149
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:32,850
That’s supposed to be democracy!

150
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:35,330
You have to be extremely careful.

151
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:36,810
I was surprised in Perth.

152
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:41,470
We were going in the night for about thirty-five
kilometres.

153
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:44,110
No gangsterism on the way, I was surprised.

154
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:47,390
How this country is still saved.

155
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:53,820
But it happens that this kind of democracy
without being in connection with that all-pervading

156
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:57,370
power can take you to anything.

157
00:15:57,370 --> 00:15:59,529
Same with religions.

158
00:15:59,529 --> 00:16:04,630
You take any religion, whether you are Hindu,
Christian, Muslim, anything.

159
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,620
One can commit any sin.

160
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:12,510
What’s the use of denouncing others; everybody
does the same I thing; no difference.

161
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:24,400
All are only convinced they are something
excellent but they are not, in no way!

162
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:31,190
And so many things like this, when we start
seeing, we get disillusioned and we start

163
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:37,690
thinking, “Where is the truth, where is
the reality, what are we doing?”

164
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:43,709
At this time, I see; I call them ‘the seekers
of truth’.

165
00:16:43,709 --> 00:16:55,190
These are special category of people, as described
by so many poets.

166
00:16:55,190 --> 00:17:07,010
And when it works out, they are the ones who
jump into themselves.

167
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:12,669
Jump into this beautiful era, of what we call
the New Age.

168
00:17:12,669 --> 00:17:13,940
It’s a happening.

169
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:18,740
It’s not just branding yourself New Age;
somebody calls themselves by some other name,

170
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,360
it’s not that.

171
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:23,589
It’s another Christian, Hindu, Muslim branding.

172
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:30,290
But something that has to happen and that
happening is awakening of the kundalini.

173
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:38,010
William Blake has said that men of God will
be born in those days, men of God.

174
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:42,110
And they will become divine and they will
have powers to make others divine, exactly

175
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:49,610
that is Sahaja Yoga.

176
00:17:49,610 --> 00:18:00,880
Moreover it’s such an internal happening
that, all outside things are not needed.

177
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:06,429
For example, some people go to Himalayas,
stand on their heads.

178
00:18:06,429 --> 00:18:11,320
Or they starve themselves, fast, do all kinds
of things.

179
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,320
And they find nothing.

180
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,799
They can’t understand how it happens.

181
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:21,960
They go on telling me; Mother we did this,
we did that and we never found anything within

182
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,840
ourselves.

183
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:32,190
So first you are to be connected to that all
pervading power, this is the power that’s

184
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:38,980
extremely dynamic no doubt, but it’s the
power of compassion.

185
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,840
So you also become very dynamic.

186
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,040
I know poor people becoming very rich suddenly.

187
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:47,909
I have seen people who are sick becoming all
right.

188
00:18:47,909 --> 00:18:55,940
We have a very nice place in Perth, where
a boy who was already married, had children,

189
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:57,119
two children.

190
00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:03,940
He was in an accident and whole his brain
as if came out; a terrible condition.

191
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:07,419
And doctors gave it up that he will die.

192
00:19:07,419 --> 00:19:11,779
Not that he was saved, but he is absolutely
normal now.

193
00:19:11,779 --> 00:19:19,289
I was in tears to see him so beautifully cured.

194
00:19:19,289 --> 00:19:31,669
So this all-pervading power, which is the
Ocean of Bliss, Ocean of Knowledge, Ocean

195
00:19:31,669 --> 00:19:39,889
of Compassion, is the Ocean of Forgiveness.

196
00:19:39,889 --> 00:19:43,549
This power starts flowing through you.

197
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:47,640
You become a vehicle of that power.

198
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:57,330
And once you learn how to make others the
same way, how to raise their kundalini, you

199
00:19:57,330 --> 00:20:00,929
can create thousands of people who are self-realized.

200
00:20:00,929 --> 00:20:09,239
Surprisingly, in Australia many children are
born who are realized souls, very surprising.

201
00:20:09,239 --> 00:20:16,880
Maybe because in other European countries
children are killed by the parents.

202
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:21,259
So maybe they are taking to you people who
are kind to children and your government is

203
00:20:21,259 --> 00:20:23,830
also very kind to them.

204
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:33,830
And these children are not understood by parents
sometimes because they’re very different.

205
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:36,779
And they are very moral.

206
00:20:36,779 --> 00:20:44,640
So all the problems that we have created out
of our ideas of sort of modernism or any kind

207
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,159
of thing.

208
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:54,360
And that we see that our children are going
to dogs is all stopped through this awakening.

209
00:20:54,360 --> 00:21:03,299
It’s like this, that if I tell some children
don’t take to drugs, they’ll never listen

210
00:21:03,299 --> 00:21:05,100
to me.

211
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:11,330
If, supposing I’m carrying a snake in my
hand and there’s darkness all over, I can’t

212
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:14,869
see anything and somebody says, “you have
a snake in your hand”, I’ll never give

213
00:21:14,869 --> 00:21:17,720
up if I’m very obstinate, I will never give
up.

214
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,760
I’ll say, “No, it’s just a rope.”

215
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:26,379
But when there’s little light I will myself
give it up.

216
00:21:26,379 --> 00:21:32,120
In the same way it happens; it works this
way that you yourself become powerful.

217
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:41,019
Throw away all that is destructive, all that
is to be given up.

218
00:21:41,019 --> 00:21:45,390
I don’t have to say “Don’t do this;
the Ten Commandments we don’t talk about

219
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:50,379
in Sahaja Yoga, but only in you, the religion
is born.

220
00:21:50,379 --> 00:21:56,359
The innate religion, which keeps you religious,
righteous, compassionate and dynamic.

221
00:21:56,359 --> 00:22:01,691
You don’t have to change your dress, you
don’t have to change your lifestyle, you

222
00:22:01,691 --> 00:22:06,840
don’t have to give up your wives and children,
but you get it just where you are.

223
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:10,869
It’s so simple, made so simple.

224
00:22:10,869 --> 00:22:16,019
I would say, if you are hungry, you can have
it.

225
00:22:16,019 --> 00:22:22,049
Like, if I’ve done the cooking, and if you
are hungry and you will say otherwise “mother

226
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:23,229
just lets have the food.”

227
00:22:23,229 --> 00:22:27,440
But if you are not, then you will go on discussing,
arguing, this, that.

228
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,549
These are all mental feats.

229
00:22:31,549 --> 00:22:36,519
I mean if you want to ask me a question, you
can ask me any number and I am quite an expert

230
00:22:36,519 --> 00:22:43,860
now 25 years I have been facing all of you
and I can answer you, but its all a mental

231
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:44,860
feat.

232
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:46,240
It doesn’t give you realization.

233
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:51,679
You are here for your realization, by which
you are helped so much that physically, mentally,

234
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:57,809
emotionally, and spiritually you become all
right.

235
00:22:57,809 --> 00:23:04,229
Firstly, you become peaceful, absolutely peaceful.

236
00:23:04,229 --> 00:23:06,590
The peace within you, you achieve.

237
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:08,000
How?

238
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,299
You live with your thoughts.

239
00:23:10,299 --> 00:23:17,779
The thoughts rise, fall, rise, fall and in
between these thoughts, there’s a little

240
00:23:17,779 --> 00:23:18,789
space.

241
00:23:18,789 --> 00:23:22,859
Mostly, you are thinking about the future
or the past.

242
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:27,269
You cannot be in the present.

243
00:23:27,269 --> 00:23:29,309
In the present, there is no thought.

244
00:23:29,309 --> 00:23:31,840
You are with reality.

245
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:36,510
So when the kundalini rises, these thoughts
elongate and the space in between, of the

246
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:39,710
present is established.

247
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:48,029
When that space is established, you become
peaceful, absolutely peaceful within yourself.

248
00:23:48,029 --> 00:24:00,220
I have met many people, elite people, I should
say, very elite, who have got Peace Prizes.

249
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:06,759
They’re so hot-tempered people, I tell you,
that you have to touch them with a barge pole.

250
00:24:06,759 --> 00:24:08,679
I mean you cannot go near them.

251
00:24:08,679 --> 00:24:13,440
It is horribly hot-tempered people, and they
have got peace awards I don’t know how.

252
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,440
No peace within.

253
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:17,600
At the slightest thing, they just shoot off.

254
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,640
No patience, nothing.

255
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:28,429
And then I realize that it’s so outside;
the whole thing is.

256
00:24:28,429 --> 00:24:34,049
They don’t understand if you don’t have
peace within, how can have a Peace Award?

257
00:24:34,049 --> 00:24:36,049
Well you can.

258
00:24:36,049 --> 00:24:38,919
That is our life.

259
00:24:38,919 --> 00:24:45,260
Now this peace is established within you and
you become, it’s a new dimension of existence,

260
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:46,770
where you become “thoughtlessly aware”.

261
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:50,230
You are absolutely aware, but no thoughts.

262
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:51,880
Just in peace.

263
00:24:51,880 --> 00:25:02,940
But you are aware; you are not fainted down
or you are not in some sort of a trance.

264
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:12,450
You are absolutely aware and very much more
aware because, you are in Reality.

265
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:17,259
Then the second dimension you achieve is that
you start feeling on your fingertips this

266
00:25:17,259 --> 00:25:20,720
cool breeze of the Holy Ghost.

267
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,769
Sometimes you feel it hot, also.

268
00:25:22,769 --> 00:25:30,259
On these fingertips are your sympathetic centres.

269
00:25:30,259 --> 00:25:35,559
And these Sympathetic Centres are from left
and right.

270
00:25:35,559 --> 00:25:39,779
They join together to make the Parasympathetic.

271
00:25:39,779 --> 00:25:47,240
So we have the left side and the right side
within us, and these left and right side,

272
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,940
indicates on our right and left side.

273
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:56,849
On the left side we get our emotional and
the right side our mental.

274
00:25:56,849 --> 00:26:01,720
I mean English Language, “mental” means
something different, but I mean whatever we

275
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,749
do with our brain.

276
00:26:03,749 --> 00:26:10,629
And also you receive your physical problems
on the right hand side.

277
00:26:10,629 --> 00:26:14,529
These problems are indicative on your fingertips.

278
00:26:14,529 --> 00:26:23,739
Said it by Hazrat Mohammed that at the time
of Qiyamah your hands will speak and will

279
00:26:23,739 --> 00:26:28,190
give witness against you; means they will
tell you what’s wrong with you.

280
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:33,539
But not only that; they also tell you what’s
wrong with others.

281
00:26:33,539 --> 00:26:40,399
Now somehow if you know how to correct these
centres, you’re all right, and correct the

282
00:26:40,399 --> 00:26:44,929
centres of others you can also make them all
right.

283
00:26:44,929 --> 00:26:49,230
It’s so simple, it’s all within you, all
the mechanism is within you.

284
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:50,940
It’s all there.

285
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:55,139
Only thing you have to understand the importance
of it.

286
00:26:55,139 --> 00:26:57,419
Without that you can never be happy.

287
00:26:57,419 --> 00:27:01,529
This power, which is there, is the power of
pure desire.

288
00:27:01,529 --> 00:27:06,210
All other desires are not pure.

289
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:09,340
Today we want to have say; some flowers.

290
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:12,730
Tomorrow we want to have a house; the day
after tomorrow we want to have helicopter.

291
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:16,120
I don’t know; we go on and on.

292
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:21,080
So every desire, which is fulfilled, is never
satisfied!

293
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,320
Once we get it, it’s finished.

294
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:28,279
Then again of course, it’s a law of economics
also, that in general, wants are not satiable.

295
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:29,749
It’s a fact.

296
00:27:29,749 --> 00:27:33,549
But this desire, whether you know it or not,
is within you.

297
00:27:33,549 --> 00:27:39,580
Whether you are aware of it or not, is the
desire to be one with this all-pervading power.

298
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:45,320
And all the powers that you have within you
start manifesting.

299
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:51,230
You have no idea at all what powers you have.

300
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:56,759
I always say about a television taken to a
very remote village in India where they have

301
00:27:56,759 --> 00:27:59,029
never seen electricity.

302
00:27:59,029 --> 00:28:03,820
And if you tell them that in this box you
can see some films, they’ll say, “What,

303
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:05,740
this is just a box!

304
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:07,309
What are you telling us stories?”

305
00:28:07,309 --> 00:28:12,259
We also feel we are just a box, nothing more
than a box.

306
00:28:12,259 --> 00:28:15,389
But do you know what powers you have within
yourself?

307
00:28:15,389 --> 00:28:18,590
What you can do for this world?

308
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:23,549
What can you do for yourself, to your family,
to your children?

309
00:28:23,549 --> 00:28:33,109
How you can really be a great force of reforms
and transformation without troubling anybody?

310
00:28:33,109 --> 00:28:38,119
Because, after this you know the absolute
truth.

311
00:28:38,119 --> 00:28:40,869
You know them on your fingertips.

312
00:28:40,869 --> 00:28:46,759
If a man from India comes from the jail, he’ll
directly come either to Australia or he will

313
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:55,350
go to America, wear a dress of a what you
call this saddhu baba dress in saffron colour,

314
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:59,169
and go and sit in any place and become a big
guru.

315
00:28:59,169 --> 00:29:01,929
Earn a lot of money.

316
00:29:01,929 --> 00:29:11,090
How will you know if this fellow has been
to jail, or is he a real person or not?

317
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:17,369
So on your fingertips you can find out the
absolute truth.

318
00:29:17,369 --> 00:29:27,620
A new dimension in you, that on your fingertips
you know not only your centres, but the centres

319
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:28,679
of others.

320
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:32,590
Everybody feels the same way, knows the same
way.

321
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:37,510
Then where is the quarrel, where is the argument,
where is the war?

322
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:44,490
Now we have in India sometimes, people coming
from sixty nations because Sahaja Yoga is

323
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:46,020
now practised in sixty nations.

324
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:50,370
I’ve never seen them quarrelling, fighting,
of course they pull each other’s leg and

325
00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:57,200
have a little humor about it, but never have
I seen fighting, never!

326
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,080
No question, no question of argument.

327
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:05,529
Because, you do not know the absolute truth,
so somebody says that Christianity is good,

328
00:30:05,529 --> 00:30:11,559
somebody says this Islam is good, somebody
says that is good or democracy is good, or

329
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:12,720
communism is good.

330
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,720
How?

331
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:18,119
How do you know that?

332
00:30:18,119 --> 00:30:23,009
Because you have got yarn in your heads, and
that’s how you’re formed your own ideas

333
00:30:23,009 --> 00:30:25,720
and you’re all fighting with each other.

334
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:28,529
It’s all mental, which is all limited.

335
00:30:28,529 --> 00:30:34,909
But, with this, you know the Absolute and
is tangible.

336
00:30:34,909 --> 00:30:36,549
You can diagnose people.

337
00:30:36,549 --> 00:30:46,619
One fellow went to Huston and he said “Mother,
I was half dead with diagnosis only.

338
00:30:46,619 --> 00:30:49,429
But I said, “You don’t have to do anything
in Sahaja Yoga like that.

339
00:30:49,429 --> 00:30:52,460
You can diagnose about yourself, you can diagnose
about others.

340
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:56,629
There’s no need to go through all that.

341
00:30:56,629 --> 00:31:01,919
This is what it is that you have to have your
own powers manifesting.

342
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:05,669
And you must have the full knowledge about
it.

343
00:31:05,669 --> 00:31:09,279
It should not be half way.

344
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:17,250
Your attention becomes extremely innocent
and powerful.

345
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:23,219
The attention, when it is diverted everywhere;
you see you get confused and people get schizophrenia,

346
00:31:23,219 --> 00:31:24,219
this, that; all that.

347
00:31:24,219 --> 00:31:33,289
But here the attention is very innocent and
such a person, even if he radiates or even

348
00:31:33,289 --> 00:31:41,320
if he looks at or glances at somebody; he
can give peace; he can give redemption; he

349
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:47,719
can do so many things, he can do, because
his attention has become enlightened.

350
00:31:47,719 --> 00:31:51,649
Sitting down here you can know about anybody
you want to know.

351
00:31:51,649 --> 00:31:57,159
You can know about the people who are dead,
or the people who are very far away.

352
00:31:57,159 --> 00:32:04,799
You can find out sitting down.

353
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:08,130
This is what we can call as “collective
consciousness”.

354
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:14,399
A new dimension of consciousness comes to
you about which Jung has written, collective

355
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:15,879
consciousness.

356
00:32:15,879 --> 00:32:19,019
So you develop this collective consciousness
within yourself.

357
00:32:19,019 --> 00:32:23,230
For that you don’t need any education, you
don’t need anything.

358
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:24,230
Even villagers can do it.

359
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:28,239
Even small little children can do it, because
they know this power.

360
00:32:28,239 --> 00:32:33,889
As all of us have the power to see something,
as you all can see me sitting down here, in

361
00:32:33,889 --> 00:32:44,419
the same way you can know about others; know
about yourself; without doing any acrobats.

362
00:32:44,419 --> 00:32:50,249
So simple as that, all these powers are your.

363
00:32:50,249 --> 00:32:56,710
But above all, you jump in the Sea Of Joy.

364
00:32:56,710 --> 00:33:03,899
The whole problem is taken over by this all-pervading
power of God.

365
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:06,230
We say we leave it to God, all right, leave
it to God.

366
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:07,769
But you are not connected.

367
00:33:07,769 --> 00:33:11,320
When we pray also we are not connected.

368
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:16,809
You know a telephone, which is not connected,
you go on moving it, it will get spoiled but

369
00:33:16,809 --> 00:33:18,450
you are not connected.

370
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:25,539
After realization, even to, just a problem
comes to you and it gets solved, because you

371
00:33:25,539 --> 00:33:30,259
get out of your problem and you can see it
clearly and the Divine helps you.

372
00:33:30,259 --> 00:33:37,779
There have been so many blissful miracles
of Sahaja Yogis that now we have given up.

373
00:33:37,779 --> 00:33:42,211
We wanted to print them, but in one month
they became so much high and we didn’t know

374
00:33:42,211 --> 00:33:43,399
what to do.

375
00:33:43,399 --> 00:33:51,780
So, all over we have to not believe in God,
but you have to feel the bliss of God; how

376
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:54,169
He looks after you.

377
00:33:54,169 --> 00:34:00,369
It’s not just a talk or a sermon, but it’s
a happening and the happening has to take

378
00:34:00,369 --> 00:34:05,340
place; otherwise our attention, which is outside,
will not be taken inside.

379
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:11,589
It’s a question of understanding our own
value, respecting ourselves.

380
00:34:11,589 --> 00:34:13,839
And it works.

381
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:16,649
As you all are here I know you are all seekers.

382
00:34:16,649 --> 00:34:18,950
Otherwise you would not be here.

383
00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:22,649
And it is your right to get this realization.

384
00:34:22,649 --> 00:34:27,440
Sahaja means “born”: ‘sah’ is with
you; ‘jah’ is “born”.

385
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,359
“With you” is “born”.

386
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:34,369
This right to get to this yoga, means the
union with the Divine.

387
00:34:34,369 --> 00:34:39,860
And is your right and you should assert and
all those who will ask for it have to have

388
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:40,860
it.

389
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:42,050
It is their right.

390
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:45,470
The whole thing has built in our evolutionary
process.

391
00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:52,649
And now, the last bit has to happen and it
will work out.

392
00:34:52,649 --> 00:34:57,070
I have to tell you one thing more; that it
is not an individual happening.

393
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:59,400
It’s a collective happening.

394
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:02,910
It works better when there are many people.

395
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:08,460
Also when you have to know about it, learn
about it, take advantage of it, you have to

396
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:09,619
come to the collective.

397
00:35:09,619 --> 00:35:15,060
It’s not like other organizations where
they have an introductory lecture and after

398
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:16,700
that they start marketing it.

399
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:18,609
You cannot market it.

400
00:35:18,609 --> 00:35:21,940
For definite, you cannot market it.

401
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:23,590
It is divine love.

402
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:27,460
And love you can never market.

403
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:32,230
In the same way this is Divine Love; how can
you market it?

404
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:38,390
So, if you have respect for yourself, if you
really love yourself, and you care for yourself,

405
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:46,030
you are not self-centered because after all,
you are a human being; epitome of evolution.

406
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:53,530
So, only thing you have to give some time
and come to the collective and progress in

407
00:35:53,530 --> 00:35:54,530
Sahaja Yoga.

408
00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:55,900
It’s not difficult at all.

409
00:35:55,900 --> 00:36:02,070
Nothing is to be done as I told you; it’s
not to stand on your head or anything.

410
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:04,020
Just wherever you are, you’ll get it.

411
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:06,280
It’s so simple.

412
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:09,280
Because the time has come.

413
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,140
And you are not obliged to me buying for anything.

414
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:19,390
It’s just happening, happening all over
and happens to everyone.

415
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:23,080
So I would request you to pay attention to
it.

416
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:27,870
And once you get your realization, you should
really come to the collective because it would

417
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:35,590
be like what Christ has described as sprouted,
seeds which were thrown somewhere and were

418
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:40,050
lost, so you have to grow, and that growth
is important.

419
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:45,640
Once it happens, if you have any concern for
your country, for yourself and for the world,

420
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:49,220
you should try to keep to it and understand.

421
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:51,680
It’s as simple as that.

422
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:57,410
So the last thing as I told you, jump in the
ocean of joy.

423
00:36:57,410 --> 00:37:04,140
That is, when your ego is pampered you feel
happy and when the ego is punctured, you feel

424
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:05,280
unhappy.

425
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,340
It is joy, has no duality.

426
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:10,770
It’s just a witness state in which you witness
everything like a drama.

427
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:18,290
And you lose your age very much.

428
00:37:18,290 --> 00:37:22,000
You feel very dynamic; at the same time very
compassionate.

429
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,870
As you know I’m seventy-one years of age
and I’m traveling practically every third

430
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:27,870
day.

431
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:28,870
And it’s all right.

432
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:30,350
People said “Mother, don’t you feel you
are traveling too much?”

433
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:32,730
I said, “I’m not traveling, I’m just
sitting everywhere.

434
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:35,700
Where am I traveling?”

435
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:38,200
In the same way, it happens to you.

436
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:44,920
And the ageing and all that never comes into
your mind.

437
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:49,470
You just live; live in the present.

438
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:54,970
And you just enjoy life; enjoy the company
of all other realized souls.

439
00:37:54,970 --> 00:37:56,290
All over the world you have relations.

440
00:37:56,290 --> 00:38:01,890
Wherever you go they’ll be all there to
help you, to look after you.

441
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:06,780
Something happens to one person, all over
the world they will try to help, the doctors

442
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:14,770
will run to that place, people will pray,
and I mean they will see to it that the person

443
00:38:14,770 --> 00:38:15,770
is saved.

444
00:38:15,770 --> 00:38:22,640
It’s such a big family, such a beautiful
family into which I would request you to join.

445
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:32,080
May God bless you!

446
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:41,790
Now, I cannot force self realization, cannot
be done, because I respect your freedom.

447
00:38:41,790 --> 00:38:49,380
You are given freedom at a human level because
you have to ascent with your own, with your

448
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:54,260
own desire, I cannot force on you anything.

449
00:38:54,260 --> 00:39:02,770
As you have to accept it that you want to
have it.

450
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:07,810
I would request people who don’t want to
have it, they should leave the hall and leave

451
00:39:07,810 --> 00:39:13,450
others, but those who want to have it are
very welcome, and they can have it.

452
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:19,220
Even the knowledge they can have it without
any difficulties.

453
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:27,580
So all those who want to go away should leave
the hall, please, I will be very thankful,

454
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:31,010
because it cannot work on people who do not
want it.

455
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:35,960
On the contrary it doesn’t help others also
to have such people among you who don’t

456
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:45,590
want to have it.

457
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:55,440
It will take hardly ten minutes and I would
request you not to disturb others when we

458
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,050
are in the process of it.

459
00:39:58,050 --> 00:40:04,850
Actually it happens spontaneously without
anything but as there are little problems

460
00:40:04,850 --> 00:40:10,760
on the centers, you have to nourish your centers
yourself as I’ll tell you, its very simple

461
00:40:10,760 --> 00:42:28,190
and will show you how we 

462
00:42:28,190 --> 00:53:02,070
do it.

463
00:53:02,070 --> 01:14:08,810
[Self Realization]
