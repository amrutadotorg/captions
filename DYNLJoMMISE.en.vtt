00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:12.056
Shri Mataji:﻿…Then he starts treating
people, then he passes negativity more.

00:00:12.771 --> 00:00:15.475
And it starts appearing to
be something good, you see.

00:00:15.738 --> 00:00:18.808
Sometimes he also feels
that he’s acquired more powers,

00:00:19.008 --> 00:00:23.808
because these spirits are very cunning
and they establish that kind of an atmosphere.

00:00:26.515 --> 00:00:30.141
So one has to be careful.
There’s a regular warfare going on.

00:00:31.564 --> 00:00:35.641
And that’s why we have to
just keep our spirits all right.

00:00:35.841 --> 00:00:38.475
And cowardice has no place in this war.

00:00:41.055 --> 00:00:45.282
The whole thing will work out very
well if people are identified with the Truth.

00:00:45.515 --> 00:00:48.848
But Truth, as you know, is
very difficult to be identified with;

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:52.808
very difficult for human beings,
absolutely next to impossible.

00:00:53.008 --> 00:00:56.093
If you tell them to be idiots, they’ll accept you.

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.641
If you tell them to be stupid, they’ll accept you.

00:00:58.841 --> 00:01:04.308
Any sort of a thing that makes them
look absolutely donkeys, they will do it.

00:01:05.001 --> 00:01:08.051
If you tell them to be false, they will do it.

00:01:08.461 --> 00:01:11.260
If you create any atmosphere
of falsehood, they’ll accept you.

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.500
But the truth? Very difficult. Very difficult.

00:01:16.031 --> 00:01:19.638
Even you will know there are
some people that see my photograph

00:01:19.838 --> 00:01:23.500
and they get the cool breeze, but
then when they see me fully, they cannot.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.000
Because when they see the photograph
there’s a lot of darkness still in them.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.054
So they believe into me because of that part of
that is darkness, because I’m just a photograph.

00:01:32.255 --> 00:01:36.005
But as soon as they see me
they just don’t want to accept me.

00:01:38.548 --> 00:01:44.833
We had a very nice place in Delhi:

00:01:45.033 --> 00:01:50.520
I asked Gregoire to go and
speak to the girls of Delhi University.

00:01:50.867 --> 00:01:56.859
Him being a young white person and handsome
and all that, they were all very much impressed.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:03.208
And with that thing, I mean, he was saying that there’s
somebody like that. And they were feeling the vibrations all right.

00:02:03.598 --> 00:02:06.065
But when they came to me
they never felt any vibrations.

00:02:06.265 --> 00:02:09.565
Just imagine! From Gregoire
they were feeling, not from me!

00:02:11.098 --> 00:02:14.565
But then they recovered from it
and now they are much better off.

00:02:14.765 --> 00:02:16.765
But this was the thing.

00:02:17.264 --> 00:02:20.581
So, because of this, you see,

00:02:20.835 --> 00:02:26.150
the people who represent darkness
and falsehood are more successful.

00:02:26.475 --> 00:02:30.231
The spiritualists are much
more successful than a saint.

00:02:37.812 --> 00:02:40.078
Yogi: I never had to pay any money.

00:02:40.278 --> 00:02:43.020
Shri Mataji: This can be
also because they do not know;

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.499
they are very intentioned, they think
they have got powers. You are human.

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:51.898
And by that they have a satisfaction to
say that, “We are doing good to others.”

00:02:52.098 --> 00:02:55.220
But they do not know the
know-how, you see. That is the point.

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.731
Because here the people are not
that cunning as we have in India.

00:03:01.161 --> 00:03:04.731
If they know that they are
doing harm, they would not do it.

00:03:05.144 --> 00:03:07.758
We have very cunning people in our country:

00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:12.731
even if they know they are doing harm, still
they’ll do it if they can get some money out of you.

00:03:12.932 --> 00:03:15.134
So they haven’t got any conscience about it.

00:03:15.334 --> 00:03:21.224
So, here if the people see that they have
done good to someone then they start doing it,

00:03:21.424 --> 00:03:24.231
thinking they have powers, this, that.

00:03:24.431 --> 00:03:30.728
Because sometimes also they get
a vision, sometimes they get a feeling:

00:03:30.928 --> 00:03:35.398
all these things can be there
due to these spirits coming in.

00:03:36.594 --> 00:03:39.966
In India it is a very common
experience of many people.

00:03:40.167 --> 00:03:42.746
They worship a deity all the time,

00:03:42.946 --> 00:03:48.808
and suddenly they find the garland
that they put into the neck of the deity

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:51.745
gets up from there and comes into their own necks.

00:03:51.945 --> 00:03:57.231
Then they think, “Now God has accepted
us as great saints!” Finished! This is their idea.

00:03:57.431 --> 00:04:02.769
Now it is nothing but some
dissatisfied soul who puts it on them.

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:06.398
And they start believing into
it, that it is God who has done it.

00:04:06.598 --> 00:04:10.644
Then they will start a big place
and will announce to everyone that,

00:04:10.844 --> 00:04:15.812
“I am a saint and this will happen and that will happen.”
And people are also impressed with this kind of thing.

00:04:16.012 --> 00:04:19.565
And they would again ask for this thing to happen.

00:04:19.765 --> 00:04:25.731
There are people who start getting
this red kumkum from their hands flowing.

00:04:26.462 --> 00:04:29.231
So people believe into it. They think that,

00:04:29.228 --> 00:04:33.901
“Yes, must be something great, otherwise how
can this red powder flowing from their hands?”

00:04:33.941 --> 00:04:36.123
Or sometimes ashes start.

00:04:36.324 --> 00:04:41.364
And we have got, say in Bombay we have a temple,

00:04:42.175 --> 00:04:45.085
we have a temple of Mahalakshmi,

00:04:45.286 --> 00:04:51.493
and they think that Mahalakshmi temple
is the place where the Goddess resides.

00:04:51.693 --> 00:04:54.831
No doubt there is a very,

00:04:56.026 --> 00:05:00.716
genuine temple,

00:05:00.917 --> 00:05:04.531
I would say - Not temple, but
even the statue is absolutely genuine.

00:05:04.731 --> 00:05:08.610
But the people who are there are so funny

00:05:09.548 --> 00:05:15.031
that they get hold of some maid
servants and then spirits comes into them.

00:05:15.231 --> 00:05:17.478
They start doing, “Hooo, huuu,” like that.

00:05:17.678 --> 00:05:25.092
This is called as dhagni tirani:
means there’s a big pot you get for water.

00:05:25.581 --> 00:05:31.286
And in that water they go on saying,
“Huuuun, huuuun,” inside the waters,

00:05:32.124 --> 00:05:34.531
and they get those spirits into them.

00:05:34.731 --> 00:05:37.097
And then they go on, “Huuuun, huuuun,” like that.

00:05:37.297 --> 00:05:41.635
All the people go on like
that, all these maid servants.

00:05:41.836 --> 00:05:45.067
And then these people come and ask them questions,

00:05:45.267 --> 00:05:50.031
like, “What is the horse we are going
to get?” “Where is my brother?” All this.

00:05:50.231 --> 00:05:55.611
And they answer, then they
believe into it. So they get some money.

00:05:55.731 --> 00:05:59.619
But these women are
horrible women in their own lives

00:05:59.901 --> 00:06:04.637
and they are always sick
and they are very unhappy.

00:06:04.837 --> 00:06:08.546
But they believe into it.

00:06:08.746 --> 00:06:11.637
They believe into all these things and they do it.

00:06:11.837 --> 00:06:15.908
And while doing it, they don’t know
that they are doing anything wrong.

00:06:16.108 --> 00:06:19.137
But they get sick and they are very, very unhappy,

00:06:19.901 --> 00:06:22.637
and ultimately they die a very bad death.

00:06:23.108 --> 00:06:28.637
There was one like that in Poona,
whom they called as Mamaji, means uncle.

00:06:28.837 --> 00:06:31.637
And he was a very, very famous man in Poona.

00:06:31.837 --> 00:06:36.470
Even the police used to use
that man for doing this spirits’ job.

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:39.970
But they knew that those were
spirits and these are not Gods.

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:44.637
Only these women, the way they do it, they
think it is the Goddess that has come into them.

00:06:44.837 --> 00:06:48.637
Now Goddess should have some sense
to come into these horrible women, isn’t it!

00:06:48.837 --> 00:06:51.856
But people don’t think
about it; so they believe into it.

00:06:52.056 --> 00:06:55.137
But this man, this gentleman who was in Poona,

00:06:55.337 --> 00:06:58.970
because I was staying with
the police commissioner there,

00:06:59.249 --> 00:07:03.550
the police commissioner called
him and so he came and he told me,

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:08.374
“Mother, I really wanted to meet You for one reason
that I’m now fed up of these spirits that I have used,

00:07:08.575 --> 00:07:13.303
and if You could get rid of them I’ll be very
happy, because now I’m being tortured by them.

00:07:13.503 --> 00:07:16.005
And I know what sort of
a death I am going to have:

00:07:16.205 --> 00:07:21.735
they are going to eat my flesh one by
one and I’m going to die much earlier,

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:24.872
before my death, the way
they will torture my life.”

00:07:25.073 --> 00:07:29.460
So all this, you see, he was frightened about,

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:33.404
because he had seen other also
people who did this kind of work.

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:36.651
Tantrikas, suffering.
So he was very much frightened.

00:07:37.042 --> 00:07:41.406
So I said, “All right, then you ask
for the Parama,” means the highest.

00:07:41.606 --> 00:07:45.073
“You ask for that superior thing, superior most.”

00:07:45.274 --> 00:07:48.337
He said, “All right, I ask for it.”

00:07:48.537 --> 00:07:50.884
I said, “All right, say it
thrice that you ask for it.”

00:07:51.084 --> 00:07:54.167
He said, “Yes, give me that,
Mother. Give me that. Give me that.”

00:07:54.892 --> 00:07:59.073
I said, “All right, I’ll give you that.”
And he got his realisation, to start with.

00:07:59.273 --> 00:08:01.363
He got the vibrations above all that.

00:08:01.563 --> 00:08:04.946
I said, “Now you have lost all these
horrible bhoots and their powers

00:08:05.146 --> 00:08:09.217
and now you’ll have your own
powers coming in and they will act.

00:08:09.418 --> 00:08:15.240
These, your own, powers will act which
you can be able to manoeuvre and help others.”

00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:19.894
He could not believe in me. He thought
that whatever he had for twenty-five years,

00:08:20.094 --> 00:08:22.239
how can he get rid of them just like this?

00:08:22.439 --> 00:08:26.607
So he went to the police commissioner and
told him that, “Oh, Mataji is telling me like this.

00:08:26.807 --> 00:08:29.998
I don’t believe it. I can
always call those spirits.”

00:08:30.198 --> 00:08:36.073
The police used to use him
for detecting crimes and things.

00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:42.239
So he said, “All right, if you think so, why
not call one of the spirits? Say your mantra.”

00:08:42.439 --> 00:08:47.403
He started saying mantras, nobody would come in.
He tried for half an hour, nobody would come in.

00:08:47.603 --> 00:08:50.412
He said, “Do you mean to say
I’ve lost all that?” I said, “Yes.”

00:08:50.612 --> 00:08:55.239
I said, “Now thank your stars you will have
better death at least!” That’s how it works out.

00:08:55.732 --> 00:09:00.559
But even in Sahaja Yoga you will be
surprised, in the beginning of Sahaja Yoga,

00:09:03.002 --> 00:09:05.523
even in the beginning of Sahaja Yoga…

00:09:12.559 --> 00:09:18.573
Shri Mataji: Regis, tell him how to sit with his left
hand towards me and right hand outside: this gentleman.

00:09:20.178 --> 00:09:22.406
No, near the door.

00:09:45.474 --> 00:09:49.536
He’s a great believer in the
Goddess. He’s a Devi bhakta.

00:09:54.625 --> 00:10:02.139
…So, it so happened that I went to America.

00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:04.575
Before going to America I told this lady that,

00:10:04.775 --> 00:10:09.214
“You are all right but your guru has
been doing all these tricks of spirits.

00:10:09.415 --> 00:10:13.083
So you will get those spirits into
you, and it will try to entice you.

00:10:13.283 --> 00:10:15.469
Because they don’t want to give up their people.

00:10:15.669 --> 00:10:20.668
They have no freedom and once they try
to get out, they just try to again entice you.”

00:10:20.972 --> 00:10:26.168
So she told me, “No, no. You just don’t
worry about me Mother I’ll keep myself all right.”

00:10:26.638 --> 00:10:30.168
Then, you know, in her own house she started a centre.

00:10:30.439 --> 00:10:32.168
She put up my big photograph.

00:10:32.368 --> 00:10:38.502
And people who come to her and she started
first giving them Sahaja Yoga and this and that.

00:10:38.702 --> 00:10:42.835
And then suddenly she started
feeling something falling from her hands.

00:10:43.035 --> 00:10:51.002
And they were some rice,

00:10:51.202 --> 00:10:56.668
the rice which is being reddened
by this kumkum: we call it as akshata.

00:10:56.868 --> 00:11:01.245
And she was so surprised at it,
that it has started falling from her.

00:11:01.445 --> 00:11:07.002
And gradually everybody was surprised and
they said lots of people started coming to her.

00:11:07.202 --> 00:11:10.361
Then they started asking her questions like,

00:11:10.562 --> 00:11:15.175
“Where is my brother?” “Where is my
father?” “What is the horse?” this, that.

00:11:15.376 --> 00:11:20.668
And she started answering that, that, “You know,
horse is going to win this race.” And they won that race.

00:11:20.868 --> 00:11:24.588
One fellow had put lot of money
somewhere and he had forgotten about it,

00:11:24.788 --> 00:11:27.668
in a big house, so she told also, where is the money.

00:11:27.868 --> 00:11:32.139
And they were all very much impressed
because they are very materialistic people.

00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:37.502
They are only interested in what money we are
going to get, or what health problems they have.

00:11:37.702 --> 00:11:42.142
They are not interested in Self-realisation.
Very, I should say, low-graded people they are.

00:11:42.342 --> 00:11:45.502
So they were just worried about
this, not worried about Self-realisation.

00:11:45.702 --> 00:11:51.002
And all such people started coming to her who were
not interested in Self-realisation but in all these things.

00:11:51.202 --> 00:11:55.168
And she became very popular;
she became so popular that there were,

00:11:55.368 --> 00:11:57.502
sometimes used to be three thousand people,

00:11:57.939 --> 00:12:00.149
and she had to take a hall and this and that.

00:12:00.349 --> 00:12:04.655
And I came to know about it somehow within myself

00:12:04.855 --> 00:12:07.502
and I immediately sent a telegram to her saying that,

00:12:07.702 --> 00:12:11.002
“Please stop all that nonsense
and please don’t do all this.”

00:12:11.202 --> 00:12:15.871
And she could not believe in this.

00:12:16.071 --> 00:12:21.538
Then when I went to India, about a
month later, she had not yet stopped.

00:12:21.738 --> 00:12:26.953
And by that time what had happened, she said,
“No, Mataji came to me and she told me that, carry on.

00:12:27.153 --> 00:12:30.205
I saw her standing before
me, she said so,” and all that.

00:12:30.405 --> 00:12:35.538
In that short time that I was there,
I mean one month or so I was not there,

00:12:35.761 --> 00:12:38.825
she started using a big whips

00:12:39.026 --> 00:12:43.371
and a big stick to hit people,
“To take out their devils,” she said.

00:12:43.571 --> 00:12:47.038
And she used to hit them very badly on their backs.

00:12:47.238 --> 00:12:51.918
And it was so horrible that
some people broke their backs

00:12:52.118 --> 00:12:54.781
and all sorts of things
happening, she was using a stick,

00:12:54.981 --> 00:12:58.099
and sometimes a very flexible one,

00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:01.610
so that they would get marks on their body.

00:13:02.064 --> 00:13:05.725
By the time I reached she came to see me,

00:13:05.925 --> 00:13:08.705
and some of the Sahaja
Yogis joined hands with her.

00:13:08.905 --> 00:13:13.539
It was so silly that I just could not understand
how these people all joined hands with her.

00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:15.662
And then she came to me and she said,

00:13:15.862 --> 00:13:19.783
“I have started a very big organisation in Your
name Mother. You must come. You must come.”

00:13:19.984 --> 00:13:24.705
So I told the Sahaja yogis, “None of you
need come. I will go myself.” So I went down.

00:13:25.428 --> 00:13:29.315
She came and she opened the door
of my thing, she washed my feet and

00:13:29.515 --> 00:13:34.705
lots of water she brought and then she
washed my feet with milk and all sorts of things.

00:13:34.905 --> 00:13:39.538
I was just feeling very embarrassed, you know,
about the whole thing! I didn’t know what to do.

00:13:39.738 --> 00:13:45.538
I went up to the room and she made me sit down there and all these people were singing my praise, this, that.

00:13:45.738 --> 00:13:51.871
I was very embarrassed: everywhere I could see all these horrible, these spirits sitting down there and mocking at me.

00:13:52.071 --> 00:13:57.293
I said, “You are going to be eat a great lout.”

00:13:58.850 --> 00:14:03.167
And I didn’t know what to do
and how to tell them about this.

00:14:03.367 --> 00:14:07.295
And then they started saying, “Hoooon!
Hoooon!” I said, “I have had it now here!”

00:14:07.496 --> 00:14:10.484
I said, “All right, I am all right. I am
going back.” She said, “We’ll do your puja.”

00:14:10.684 --> 00:14:14.128
I said, “No, no, you are not well. I’m
going back home, you come and see me there.”

00:14:14.329 --> 00:14:16.924
She was very happy. Next day she
came, she thought I was going to say,

00:14:17.124 --> 00:14:19.833
“Oh, bravo. You have done very well.”

00:14:20.033 --> 00:14:22.213
So when she came and sat next to me she said,

00:14:22.414 --> 00:14:27.167
“Now see, Mother, see how many
powers You have given me. I am so powerful!”

00:14:27.367 --> 00:14:31.870
I said, “Really? I must say you have
some powers isn’t it?” She said, “Yes.”

00:14:32.070 --> 00:14:34.833
I said, “All right, will you
tell this gentleman about him?”

00:14:35.033 --> 00:14:39.776
So she started telling him that, “You were
born in such a place and you have a house like this.”

00:14:39.977 --> 00:14:43.084
He said, “Not me. It’s not me.
You are telling about somebody else.”

00:14:43.284 --> 00:14:50.257
Then there was a lady sitting there.
She said, “You are a person who has got a clerk,

00:14:50.457 --> 00:14:53.333
in your business who is like this, whose name is this.”

00:14:53.533 --> 00:14:56.667
She said, “I don’t have a business. I don’t have a clerk.”

00:14:56.868 --> 00:15:01.167
She looked at me. She said, “Mother,
have you taken away all my powers?”

00:15:01.431 --> 00:15:06.231
I said, “If they were your powers I
would have respected you and loved you.

00:15:06.371 --> 00:15:08.338
But these were somebody else’s powers.

00:15:08.538 --> 00:15:11.890
As soon as you have entered into
my house they have left you completely.

00:15:12.090 --> 00:15:14.406
And now you go back you can get them back again,

00:15:14.606 --> 00:15:18.671
unless and until you say that I want
the eternal, the eternal, and eternal.

00:15:18.871 --> 00:15:21.681
And after this you have to be very, very particular

00:15:21.881 --> 00:15:27.477
and watch yourself, your attention, whether
you are accepting these negativities or not.”

00:15:27.678 --> 00:15:31.171
She said, “Yes, I want the
eternal, eternal and eternal.”

00:15:31.371 --> 00:15:35.763
And she was all right, and she went back
home and she was all right for about fifteen days.

00:15:35.963 --> 00:15:40.838
But you see, popularity of that kind is
very difficult, to avoid the temptations.

00:15:41.038 --> 00:15:44.215
That’s why it is said, “Lead us not into temptation,”

00:15:44.716 --> 00:15:47.985
with that same thing, “but deliver us from evil,”

00:15:48.185 --> 00:15:53.004
for the same reason: because evil is
standing in every corner you walk through.

00:15:53.204 --> 00:15:56.338
And she fell into this. And when she fell into this,

00:15:56.538 --> 00:16:01.671
she started another organisation of her own and she started this and that, and she was so frantic.

00:16:01.871 --> 00:16:07.671
Nowadays, for your information, she’s
a very serious patient in a lunatic asylum.

00:16:13.935 --> 00:16:17.367
So, human beings are like
that: they take to such things.

00:16:17.567 --> 00:16:22.837
I mean, that time only about one hundred and fifty
or two hundred people used to come and meet me,

00:16:23.037 --> 00:16:25.281
while she was getting three thousand.

00:16:26.818 --> 00:16:31.855
People want darkness, they want falsehood,
they want that somebody should hoodwink them.

00:16:32.055 --> 00:16:33.881
They want somebody should befool them.

00:16:34.081 --> 00:16:36.188
They want to live with the befooling, you see.

00:16:36.388 --> 00:16:40.955
And those who know this and know how
to handle it, they’ll just keep you on the run.

00:16:41.155 --> 00:16:43.193
They will keep you on the run all the time,

00:16:43.393 --> 00:16:46.782
that you’ll be befooled you from this
place to that place, and that place to that place.

00:16:46.983 --> 00:16:50.783
Now, there can be people who
are extremely simple-hearted.

00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:56.022
But the simplicity goes to this limit
that they cannot recognise the reality.

00:16:56.222 --> 00:17:00.522
You have to be in the centre
otherwise you can become a simpleton.

00:17:00.722 --> 00:17:05.355
And that simpleton-ness can really be very killing.

00:17:05.555 --> 00:17:08.407
But if the person is say, very intelligent,

00:17:08.607 --> 00:17:12.015
he relies on his intelligence,
then they will play on your intelligence.

00:17:12.216 --> 00:17:14.789
They will pump up your ego.

00:17:14.989 --> 00:17:20.044
They’ll do this and do that, and somehow or the other they
will get you there, because they are extremely cunning people.

00:17:20.245 --> 00:17:22.712
They are the embodiment of cunningness.

00:17:23.237 --> 00:17:25.066
So you cannot outwit them

00:17:25.266 --> 00:17:27.947
because whatever intelligence you have is limited

00:17:28.147 --> 00:17:33.855
while they have such a lot of intelligence of such
a crooked nature that you cannot go to their level.

00:17:34.055 --> 00:17:36.022
After all, you have your conscience with you.

00:17:36.222 --> 00:17:39.640
So they have no conscience and they play about so much

00:17:40.088 --> 00:17:43.355
that they really hoodwink you
and you do not know about it.

00:17:43.555 --> 00:17:51.287
And that’s how you will find that all the
incarnations who came on this Earth were killed,

00:17:51.488 --> 00:17:55.463
crucified, poisoned, like Mohammed Sahib was poisoned;

00:17:55.821 --> 00:18:03.304
or harassed, or sent to forests like Rama;

00:18:03.646 --> 00:18:07.688
and Krishna: tortured by many
rakshasas who went to kill him.

00:18:07.888 --> 00:18:12.022
All sorts of things. I mean, there is
no incarnation who has not suffered.

00:18:12.222 --> 00:18:16.688
So that now people think that if
you do not suffer you cannot go to God.

00:18:16.888 --> 00:18:21.355
This is another madness people
have, that you must suffer to go to God.

00:18:21.555 --> 00:18:23.688
So they are all carrying the cross.

00:18:23.991 --> 00:18:27.522
It was for Christ to carry
the cross, not for you people.

00:18:27.722 --> 00:18:30.531
So there is no need for you to be that miserable

00:18:30.731 --> 00:18:32.688
and take the sufferings upon yourself.

00:18:32.888 --> 00:18:35.235
There’s no need at all to suffer.

00:18:35.435 --> 00:18:40.188
There is no need at all to
unnecessarily torture your bodies,

00:18:40.388 --> 00:18:43.444
unnecessarily torture your being to such a limit

00:18:43.644 --> 00:18:48.247
that you are absolutely useless for the
day when you are going to be crowned.

00:18:48.579 --> 00:18:50.326
Come here, come in!

00:18:51.743 --> 00:18:54.084
Let him have a chair…

00:18:57.347 --> 00:19:02.084
So this is what I tell you: that
falsehood is easily acceptable to people.

00:19:02.284 --> 00:19:08.084
People accept falsehood with
such gusto and with such force

00:19:08.284 --> 00:19:11.750
and they do not even see what
is happening, they just rush to it.

00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:14.250
Because we have lived with it.

00:19:14.551 --> 00:19:16.943
First of all you have lived with matter.

00:19:17.143 --> 00:19:22.667
We are identified with it because we have lived
with it, because we do not know what is the Truth.

00:19:22.868 --> 00:19:26.668
We have lived with untruth.
We have lived with the dreams.

00:19:26.869 --> 00:19:29.169
We have not lived with the awakened state.

00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:32.084
We are not yet identified with that awakened state.

00:19:32.284 --> 00:19:35.628
That’s why you are awakened, then you go off to sleep.

00:19:35.828 --> 00:19:38.084
Again you are awakened, again you go off to sleep.

00:19:38.284 --> 00:19:42.683
You are more identified with
sleep than with awakened state:

00:19:42.884 --> 00:19:45.466
that’s why it happens all the time.

00:19:45.667 --> 00:19:50.917
Sometimes people say, “Mother, Sahaja Yoga
also, when we get realisation again we go down.”

00:19:51.117 --> 00:19:53.084
But what can we do?

00:19:53.486 --> 00:19:55.978
You see, it’s not the responsibility of Sahaja Yoga

00:19:56.178 --> 00:20:00.250
that it should just shoot you off to that place.

00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:05.588
It is also your responsibility in a way,
that if you have had problems within you

00:20:05.997 --> 00:20:11.947
and there are pouches and ditches where you
are physically hurt, mentally hurt, everybody hurt.

00:20:12.147 --> 00:20:17.673
So then what happens? That power which has really touched on top, goes back and tries to establish it.

00:20:17.874 --> 00:20:21.750
It happens like that, so nothing
to feel bad: it will again come up.

00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:23.893
It has to make your instrument all right,

00:20:24.093 --> 00:20:27.693
because your instrument
has gone into horrible things.

00:20:27.894 --> 00:20:35.084
Especially very funny habits one develops
by these horrible devils coming into you.

00:20:35.284 --> 00:20:38.750
Even a person, if he drinks too
much, then know that he’s possessed.

00:20:39.251 --> 00:20:44.346
If a person he talks very much, or he jabbers,

00:20:44.547 --> 00:20:47.914
or he’s harsh, then know that he’s possessed.

00:20:48.354 --> 00:20:53.810
All the time if he has a habit to snap at someone,

00:20:54.158 --> 00:20:58.998
shout at someone, or strict at someone
then know that he is a possessed man.

00:20:59.292 --> 00:21:02.257
Or if he has a habit to be quiet unnecessarily,

00:21:02.457 --> 00:21:05.831
he tries to be quiet all the time,
then know that he’s possessed.

00:21:06.031 --> 00:21:11.998
Any extreme behaviour is only caused by spirits.

00:21:12.587 --> 00:21:15.571
Actually what happens that, when we go to the extremes,

00:21:15.771 --> 00:21:18.164
our human awareness cannot bear it.

00:21:18.364 --> 00:21:22.663
Then what happens that we
just ask for help from outside.

00:21:22.864 --> 00:21:27.831
And there are many busybodies around:
they just enter into you and start munching.

00:21:28.935 --> 00:21:35.664
There is no need to strain your being so much and go to extremes. You have to be just in the centre.

00:21:35.864 --> 00:21:38.827
Actually, this country or any of the Western countries,

00:21:39.027 --> 00:21:41.930
I thought, would have been very
good for you because you are saints

00:21:42.130 --> 00:21:46.831
and that you would have
lived with a very temperate life.

00:21:47.031 --> 00:21:52.373
There was not such problems as we had in
India, or in any other developing countries.

00:21:52.574 --> 00:21:58.080
I thought you will be much better off
here, but, on the contrary, what I find:

00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:03.498
the material life that provided
everything for you, made a slave out of you.

00:22:03.698 --> 00:22:06.355
You even have habits of matter!

00:22:06.666 --> 00:22:12.393
Now when you have habits of matters,
there are some other habits can be put into you.

00:22:12.594 --> 00:22:14.831
And the habits that are put into you by these…

00:22:15.031 --> 00:22:17.804
Shri Mataji: Just keep your hands like this.

00:22:18.004 --> 00:22:20.606
Yogi: He’s very badly damaged.

00:22:20.806 --> 00:22:27.831
Shri Mataji: Very bad? All right, you put your left hand. You can stand or put your left hand inside...

00:22:33.262 --> 00:22:35.716
He’s from the same course as you have been (TM)

00:22:35.916 --> 00:22:44.010
and he has been jumping all the time, poor
thing. You can go there, in the door where Hesta is.

00:22:45.079 --> 00:22:50.331
And he has really hurt himself. All of
them are hurt in their bones, all of them.

00:22:52.396 --> 00:23:01.331
Any man who has left no
sense of.. you can say the dharma,

00:23:01.531 --> 00:23:05.664
or of his balances is a man who is possessed.

00:23:06.174 --> 00:23:10.218
Anyone who is doing a crime

00:23:10.418 --> 00:23:14.164
which he does not understand is also possessed.

00:23:15.384 --> 00:23:21.191
Or a human being, say a man having a
relation with a man, is a possessed condition.

00:23:21.970 --> 00:23:26.524
If a woman has relations with a
woman, it is a possessed condition.

00:23:26.724 --> 00:23:30.024
It is not a condition of a normal person.

00:23:30.224 --> 00:23:32.533
And human beings have to be normal human beings.

00:23:32.733 --> 00:23:35.570
If a woman, if she doesn’t care for her chastity

00:23:35.770 --> 00:23:38.691
and she leads a fast life that means she’s possessed.

00:23:38.891 --> 00:23:42.339
If she goes about with many
men that means she’s possessed.

00:23:42.539 --> 00:23:44.691
If the men do that they are also possessed.

00:23:44.891 --> 00:23:47.161
They cannot be normal people who do all this.

00:23:47.361 --> 00:23:53.358
You see, whatever are the sustenance of
human beings are also the powers of human beings.

00:23:53.558 --> 00:23:58.059
Like that, we can see the people who are in the centre,

00:23:58.861 --> 00:24:05.024
the people who are sustained, they do not have all these
temptations. I mean, they just don’t like it. They are just normal people.

00:24:05.224 --> 00:24:09.764
And that is what one loses gradually
by doing extremes. And you don’t even realise.

00:24:09.965 --> 00:24:13.024
The whole society could be
like that: possessed, with ideas.

00:24:13.224 --> 00:24:15.858
You can see what foolish
things we are doing in this country.

00:24:16.137 --> 00:24:19.616
I know in India they do all sorts of nonsensical things:

00:24:20.541 --> 00:24:24.687
like telling lies, and cheating people,

00:24:24.887 --> 00:24:27.787
fraud and all that is very common in India.

00:24:27.988 --> 00:24:30.529
But here the other things are there.

00:24:30.609 --> 00:24:36.569
Like the way we are wasting our
energy in nonsensical things about sex

00:24:36.769 --> 00:24:41.648
and about flirting and all this nonsense.

00:24:41.848 --> 00:24:46.879
Flirting is nothing but a virus infection of sex.

00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:48.914
Your eyes are caught up.

00:24:49.114 --> 00:24:53.896
Really, it is the infection of the
eyes, and it comes into the eye, you see.

00:24:54.096 --> 00:24:58.536
Then you start looking here and there. You don’t know what
you are looking. Flirting, if you ask them, they have no joy in it.

00:24:58.736 --> 00:25:02.063
They just see around. They see one
place to another, one woman to another.

00:25:02.263 --> 00:25:04.589
Then the woman catches it, the woman gets it.

00:25:04.789 --> 00:25:08.063
You are just looking like this. You don’t
know why. It’s a such a waste of energy.

00:25:08.263 --> 00:25:10.363
Actually, I didn’t know what was flirting.

00:25:10.563 --> 00:25:14.925
But once, when I went to America, in
seventy-three, a young boy came to me and he said,

00:25:15.125 --> 00:25:18.628
“Mother, why do I look at all these
women? I waste such a lot of energy.

00:25:18.828 --> 00:25:21.247
Why can’t I keep straight?
What is the need to look at them?”

00:25:21.447 --> 00:25:23.966
They do not know anything to it: any woman passing.

00:25:24.166 --> 00:25:28.535
Then the woman also would dress up in such
a way that she would attract somebody else.

00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:32.563
So that this is also another kind of fraternity working.

00:25:32.763 --> 00:25:38.896
And the whole game starts. We find even in places like
people are above sixty years, they do the same nonsense.

00:25:39.192 --> 00:25:42.370
It’s something surprising that even they are not mature,

00:25:42.570 --> 00:25:46.730
because if you get this poison
into you then you do not mature.

00:25:46.930 --> 00:25:50.536
It’s like any fruit which is infected cannot mature.

00:25:50.736 --> 00:25:53.588
It’s an infection and when it
comes into you, you do not mature.

00:25:53.788 --> 00:25:57.839
That’s why you find even
eighty-year-old people behaving like,

00:25:58.039 --> 00:26:03.062
just like silly young twenty-five year olds.

00:26:03.792 --> 00:26:08.536
That sort of people you find, so commonly here,
where you go. You feel so ashamed and embarrassed.

00:26:08.738 --> 00:26:14.138
And a eighty-year-old woman starts telling you about
her love affairs and you just don’t know where to look!

00:26:14.338 --> 00:26:18.229
And it’s very common. They
boast of it and they talk like that.

00:26:18.429 --> 00:26:21.329
Their talking is so funny that you can’t imagine.

00:26:21.529 --> 00:26:26.395
It’s most embarrassing the way they
talk about things and the way they live.

00:26:26.595 --> 00:26:29.046
There was a lady who told me:

00:26:29.559 --> 00:26:37.288
she is a lady of a good family and an ambassador’s wife,

00:26:37.488 --> 00:26:41.785
and she told me there’s a very great
writer here, she was about eighty years of age

00:26:41.985 --> 00:26:44.786
and she writes lots of books on philosophy and things.

00:26:44.987 --> 00:26:50.062
So she invited this lady, the
ambassador’s wife, for a lunch party.

00:26:50.262 --> 00:26:53.638
And she said, “Why lunch? I could
come for dinner with my husband.”

00:26:53.838 --> 00:26:57.726
She said, “No, no, no. I want you for lunch
and give you a nice time. I’ll get you a boyfriend.”

00:26:57.929 --> 00:27:01.379
She said, “Are you joking?” She said, “No, I have one, my own:

00:27:01.579 --> 00:27:04.678
about twenty-four years.
And what years’ age do you want?”

00:27:04.878 --> 00:27:07.968
She was shocked. She said,
“What? I don’t want all that.”

00:27:08.168 --> 00:27:13.562
She said, “You must know. You see, you women are no good.
Eastern women are no good. You must learn how to enjoy life!”

00:27:13.762 --> 00:27:22.170
She said, “I am sorry. I am not to learn that!” And she just put down the phone. Now this lady is writing books on philosophy!

00:27:23.777 --> 00:27:30.562
See the stupidity to which people are taking. And she is one of the most successful writers in England.

00:27:30.762 --> 00:27:34.187
I don’t know her name. She didn’t
tell me the name. But this is what it is.

00:27:34.388 --> 00:27:37.276
She’s successful because she is spreading darkness.

00:27:37.857 --> 00:27:41.533
Because people want to live with whatever they were.

00:27:41.843 --> 00:27:46.454
They were in darkness, they were just
matter: this dead matter is just darkness.

00:27:46.655 --> 00:27:48.961
It has no awareness in it.

00:27:49.161 --> 00:27:51.970
Then the animals have a little bit of awareness.

00:27:52.216 --> 00:27:58.070
And they come to a point when they are human beings.
They have passed through millions of years with that ignorance

00:27:58.270 --> 00:28:04.043
and that darkness and they more
adhere to it than to something that is beyond.

00:28:04.244 --> 00:28:09.464
They only evolve because God’s grace is
there, otherwise they would never have evolved.

00:28:09.664 --> 00:28:13.719
Because God has put some sort of a
seeking in their stomach that for food,

00:28:13.919 --> 00:28:16.964
for other things, they start evolving.

00:28:17.164 --> 00:28:21.302
And when they start evolving they
reach a stage of human consciousness.

00:28:21.502 --> 00:28:27.574
Now at human consciousness if I have to say
that you have to face the reality, why should you?

00:28:28.933 --> 00:28:32.964
You think that, “If I have to face
reality then I have to work for it.”

00:28:33.164 --> 00:28:35.507
Because that is another thing you have done so far.

00:28:35.707 --> 00:28:39.552
You think that you have
done something all the time to achieve something,

00:28:39.752 --> 00:28:42.256
if you have to achieve
something then you must put in effort.

00:28:42.457 --> 00:28:45.797
Then you do not want to take
that path when you were dark.

00:28:45.997 --> 00:28:48.358
We have done nothing to become a human being,

00:28:48.558 --> 00:28:52.131
and that, if we have to go further
we are not to do anything about it.

00:28:52.331 --> 00:28:55.694
On the contrary you start running fast, very fast,

00:28:55.894 --> 00:29:00.163
and if you know the phrase that, “You
take two running jumps and go to hell”.

00:29:00.489 --> 00:29:04.369
It’s like that, for example. And
you speed up so much on that,

00:29:04.569 --> 00:29:07.131
that then you land into difficulty.

00:29:09.077 --> 00:29:14.046
That’s why it is necessary to
understand that you are human beings

00:29:14.246 --> 00:29:17.631
and at this time you have
given freedom, absolute freedom.

00:29:17.831 --> 00:29:23.797
Because you have to see your own evolution.

00:29:27.309 --> 00:29:30.395
Because you are free you can see it.

00:29:30.595 --> 00:29:34.864
If you were part and
parcel of God and if He had done for you,

00:29:35.738 --> 00:29:39.204
then you would not have seen it, like animals have not.

00:29:39.405 --> 00:29:43.062
But this you have to see and you have to be aware of it.

00:29:43.262 --> 00:29:45.875
That’s why you have been given freedom.

00:29:46.738 --> 00:29:50.729
If you are not away from me how will you see me?

00:29:53.309 --> 00:29:57.229
And this is the reason you
were separated from The Whole,

00:29:57.429 --> 00:30:00.895
so that you can see that you become The Whole.

00:30:02.269 --> 00:30:05.946
While the animals do not see it because they are dark.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:12.229
They are part of The Whole, they
are looked after, they live like that,

00:30:12.922 --> 00:30:15.840
they don’t get ego, they don’t get superego,

00:30:16.041 --> 00:30:20.729
they do not speed up suddenly, they
do not do all these things, as you do.

00:30:20.929 --> 00:30:23.395
They do not have insurances!

00:30:27.708 --> 00:30:32.957
They are sensible, we think. So we go down
to them and want to learn something from them.

00:30:33.157 --> 00:30:36.414
And what do we learn from
them? Their sex behaviour! Imagine.

00:30:36.614 --> 00:30:40.792
This is human brain, specially made: real clowns!

00:30:41.636 --> 00:30:44.488
The way we look at things I don’t know how:

00:30:44.769 --> 00:30:48.473
whatever is to be done we just
do in the other way round style.

00:30:48.673 --> 00:30:51.262
Like, what you have to learn from animals

00:30:51.462 --> 00:30:54.651
that they are one with The Whole,
the trees are one with The Whole.

00:30:54.851 --> 00:30:57.935
When there is spring the
trees will bring out yellow flowers,

00:30:58.135 --> 00:31:01.272
when there is the summer
they’ll bring out the red flowers,

00:31:01.472 --> 00:31:03.818
and that’s how they express the colours.

00:31:04.398 --> 00:31:10.984
While they are looked after: whether they
are here or anywhere, they are looked after.

00:31:11.184 --> 00:31:14.484
The nature looks after them.
There is a circle between them.

00:31:14.684 --> 00:31:18.751
If the trees have the leaves..

00:31:19.716 --> 00:31:24.818
they emit carbon dioxide.

00:31:25.018 --> 00:31:28.054
Then that has to have a circle again.

00:31:28.254 --> 00:31:31.418
So the leaves have to fall down into the ground

00:31:31.618 --> 00:31:36.651
because the nature must take nitrogen
from them, and must replace it back to them,

00:31:36.851 --> 00:31:42.318
to nourish them again, so they
can go into that cycle of movement.

00:31:42.518 --> 00:31:44.815
And from how it moves from one end to another.

00:31:45.015 --> 00:31:50.654
How carbon dioxide goes into the air
and how it is again reconverted back

00:31:50.854 --> 00:31:56.760
and how the whole thing is worked out in a
cycle is done. But they do not know all about it.

00:31:58.399 --> 00:32:05.659
They do it blindly. Absolutely blindly they are doing it,
because they are blind; because they don’t need to know.

00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:11.909
Like the small little babies and
puppies of the dog, if you see, they are blind;

00:32:12.109 --> 00:32:13.484
they don’t know how to go about.

00:32:13.684 --> 00:32:20.267
They just feel their mother and just go and start sucking the
breast and take feeding. You have seen them, very sweet ones!

00:32:20.467 --> 00:32:25.151
They can’t see anything. They just smell
something, they go down there and do it.

00:32:25.351 --> 00:32:30.997
So the mother looks after them at that time, and she
does everything that is needed even when they are blind.

00:32:31.077 --> 00:32:34.649
When you are also little children,
when this is not covered up, closed,

00:32:34.850 --> 00:32:38.210
your mother looks after you,
your father will look after you.

00:32:38.410 --> 00:32:42.008
They treat you just like a part of them all the time.

00:32:42.208 --> 00:32:45.868
All the time they are worried about
you. Not in modern times, of course.

00:32:46.068 --> 00:32:50.710
Modern times are one of the most
convoluted ones. But they used to do that way.

00:32:51.552 --> 00:32:56.040
But you are grown-up then they give you freedom to know

00:32:57.588 --> 00:32:59.710
that you are grown-up.

00:33:00.886 --> 00:33:08.377
And that is how God wants you to know that you
have evolved, you have received your Realisation.

00:33:08.577 --> 00:33:11.543
That you have become what you had to become.

00:33:11.743 --> 00:33:19.535
Because you have to now really re-manifest,

00:33:21.409 --> 00:33:25.710
God’s powers.

00:33:31.084 --> 00:33:34.534
This is the thing we have to understand.

00:33:34.734 --> 00:33:37.868
And then we should know what is our role in life,

00:33:38.068 --> 00:33:43.868
and what are we doing, where are we,
how are we placed, what is our position.

00:33:44.068 --> 00:33:47.086
This should give you the complete energy,

00:33:49.061 --> 00:33:51.701
to get to your Self, and work it out.

00:33:52.654 --> 00:33:54.574
May God bless you all.
