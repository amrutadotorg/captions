00:00:03.987 --> 00:00:08.924
These days, in the modern times,

00:00:10.953 --> 00:00:14.480
we are faced with confusions:

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:20.174
that’s a sign of modern times.

00:00:20.524 --> 00:00:23.442
At the same time,

00:00:23.643 --> 00:00:30.152
the en-masse urge to search the truth
is manifesting.

00:00:30.353 --> 00:00:33.633
It’s not only one individual who feels
like that,

00:00:33.834 --> 00:00:37.867
it’s not only eight or ten people who
feel like that,

00:00:38.068 --> 00:00:41.977
but masses and masses and multitudes

00:00:42.178 --> 00:00:46.133
are feeling you have to search an answer;

00:00:46.334 --> 00:00:48.876
you have to find out why are you here;

00:00:49.077 --> 00:00:52.031
you have to know who you are;

00:00:52.232 --> 00:00:58.923
you have to find out your wholesomeness;
you have to find out the whole.

00:01:01.973 --> 00:01:11.344
There is a big movement in a very subtle
way

00:01:11.545 --> 00:01:16.909
that is moving masses towards this search.

00:01:17.846 --> 00:01:27.137
But we have no idea, perhaps, as to what
is the atmosphere in which we are born,

00:01:27.338 --> 00:01:33.488
what is the situation, how the whole stage
is laid. We have no idea.

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.480
As we have taken ourselves for granted
as human beings,

00:01:38.681 --> 00:01:41.870
we take everything for granted.

00:01:42.071 --> 00:01:46.668
We are born human beings through
our evolution

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:49.625
(but) we do not even want to think why
we were evolved

00:01:49.826 --> 00:01:52.787
from amoeba to this stage.

00:01:53.903 --> 00:01:56.645
All the whys we just shut down.

00:01:56.846 --> 00:02:00.770
Whatever is there we want to see through
these eyes, through these ears.

00:02:00.971 --> 00:02:05.692
Through these sensory organs we want
to understand.

00:02:05.893 --> 00:02:10.936
But still the urge is there to know what
is beyond.

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:15.778
The atmosphere in which we are born
cannot be understood

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:19.653
without having the light to see why
there is darkness,

00:02:19.854 --> 00:02:25.990
and darkness of such immensity, which
never [before] pervaded this Earth.

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:33.506
It was never so much before, never,
never before, than it is today.

00:02:33.707 --> 00:02:36.020
That’s why the confusion comes in.

00:02:36.221 --> 00:02:38.989
And it has an action, it has a reaction
in the same way:

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.389
the more is the urge, the more is
the confusion,

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.239
the more is the darkness.

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.006
Now this darkness around us

00:02:48.207 --> 00:02:51.552
is not only of ignorance, as it used to be.

00:02:51.753 --> 00:02:55.637
In the Vedas, or in the scriptures,
anywhere,

00:02:55.838 --> 00:02:58.506
it is written that you have to enlighten
yourself,

00:02:58.706 --> 00:03:01.949
you have to have the light. I used to say
the same thing,

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.326
not to frighten you about it too much.
I thought,

00:03:04.527 --> 00:03:07.838
“First see, they’ll have the light, then
they will be able to see.”

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:12.715
For three years I did not say anything,
a word about

00:03:12.916 --> 00:03:17.081
this darkness, the source of this darkness,

00:03:18.613 --> 00:03:20.228
till they themselves started seeing it.

00:03:20.429 --> 00:03:24.830
I knew they will see. And then I had
to start talking about it.

00:03:26.431 --> 00:03:31.051
We have to understand that satanic forces
have been let loose

00:03:31.252 --> 00:03:39.081
by some horrible Satans, like convicts
who are on the run.

00:03:39.282 --> 00:03:42.498
They are thousands and thousands
of entities,

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:47.702
controlled by some very sinister,
evil people.

00:03:47.903 --> 00:03:51.103
They call themselves as great people,
as maybe gurus

00:03:51.304 --> 00:03:57.350
or maybe saintly persons, organisers,
whatever you may say.

00:03:59.252 --> 00:04:05.098
They are controlling this satanic force.

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:09.897
And we are all surrounded by that
satanic force.

00:04:10.098 --> 00:04:17.524
As soon as we start projecting ourselves
into their areas, we get caught up.

00:04:17.725 --> 00:04:22.322
Let us see how do we project into them
and why do we get up into that,

00:04:22.523 --> 00:04:27.540
and what is the remedy for these satanic
forces.

00:04:28.732 --> 00:04:32.342
First, we project into that through
our subconscious mind,

00:04:32.543 --> 00:04:36.876
which is being described by many
psychologists: they call it psychic powers.

00:04:37.077 --> 00:04:40.785
It’s not only psychic; there are some more
things in about.

00:04:40.986 --> 00:04:45.775
Through our conditionings, through
our fears

00:04:46.474 --> 00:04:49.539
we have a mind of our own.

00:04:49.756 --> 00:04:51.662
Now mind is to be divided into two.

00:04:51.863 --> 00:04:56.809
The English [word] mind is different
from the Sanskrit [word] manas.

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:59.383
Manas is whatever is the superego in you,

00:04:59.584 --> 00:05:03.911
whatever is condition within you –
is manas.

00:05:04.112 --> 00:05:11.044
And the ego is different.

00:05:11.245 --> 00:05:15.749
So there is a superego and an ego
to a mind;

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:23.623
out of which [it’s] the superego, the mind
which starts forming habits.

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:31.176
For example, human beings have a capacity
to form habits

00:05:31.377 --> 00:05:36.452
very easily because of superego practices.

00:05:36.653 --> 00:05:39.849
The one who is using now a chair –

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:44.638
say he uses it for ten years – he cannot
sit on the ground.

00:05:45.685 --> 00:05:49.023
So the matter starts sitting on us

00:05:49.224 --> 00:05:53.141
and we start becoming slave to the matter.

00:05:54.103 --> 00:05:59.858
When our attention is obsessed by matter,
by materialism,

00:06:00.059 --> 00:06:06.643
and we start projecting ourselves under
the domain of materialism,

00:06:06.844 --> 00:06:10.868
of accepting whatever matter is
dominating us…

00:06:11.069 --> 00:06:15.514
For example, a person is crazy say about
football.

00:06:17.022 --> 00:06:22.591
It’s all right to like something, but we do
not know how to demarcate ourselves.

00:06:22.801 --> 00:06:27.367
We go on projecting into it to such
an extent – there is no control –

00:06:27.568 --> 00:06:33.899
that we become slaves to it; so much so
that we start identifying ourselves,

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:37.371
our own achievement with that football.

00:06:37.572 --> 00:06:43.476
We go to such a limit that we completely
lose our balance.

00:06:44.969 --> 00:06:50.268
But psychic powers actually arise from
sex habits.

00:06:51.118 --> 00:06:54.575
Once you start indulging into your sex
and its perversions

00:06:54.776 --> 00:06:57.719
and all those things, you go into lethargy,

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:01.917
into your subconscious area, into your
collective subconscious.

00:07:02.118 --> 00:07:06.408
And in the collective subconscious
all kinds of filthy people exist:

00:07:06.609 --> 00:07:14.187
sly, intriguers, frightened, masochists
you can call them,

00:07:14.388 --> 00:07:17.249
that type of people, they are there.

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:20.043
They are let loose, so they are there.

00:07:20.244 --> 00:07:23.282
They capture you. Then you go into
all perversions of sex,

00:07:23.483 --> 00:07:28.657
all sorts of things. You go on asking,
“What’s wrong? What’s wrong?”

00:07:28.858 --> 00:07:36.251
To keep to subconscious area you take
to alcoholism, drugs.

00:07:36.452 --> 00:07:38.486
It’s lethargic.

00:07:38.687 --> 00:07:42.537
You explain it by saying that, “Those
who are very active are aggressive.

00:07:42.738 --> 00:07:47.836
So we are taking to this kind of life by
which we are getting into lethargy.”

00:07:48.037 --> 00:07:50.990
But when you move too much into it, also,

00:07:51.191 --> 00:07:55.185
all these horrible people capture you
and you get into them

00:07:55.386 --> 00:08:02.146
and they try all kinds of tricks through
you.

00:08:02.347 --> 00:08:05.551
They become very effective.

00:08:05.758 --> 00:08:08.336
Now these gurus, they give you mantras
and things like that.

00:08:08.537 --> 00:08:13.462
These are the names of these entities
which exist in the dark.

00:08:13.663 --> 00:08:17.091
You take to those mantras and you go
into that.

00:08:17.292 --> 00:08:21.658
There are so many ways, all these
spiritualists and ESPs

00:08:21.859 --> 00:08:27.195
and all sort of these things going on
in this world.

00:08:29.172 --> 00:08:34.685
The way you can judge them is that they
do not talk of the Absolute,

00:08:34.886 --> 00:08:38.751
they do not talk of the Spirit that rests
in you.

00:08:38.952 --> 00:08:46.192
They will take the name of love, but
whatever they do is anti-love.

00:08:46.408 --> 00:08:50.046
They’ll talk about your brother dying,
father dying, mother dying,

00:08:50.247 --> 00:08:54.344
“Can you talk to them? If you want, you
can have a conversation with them.”

00:08:54.545 --> 00:09:03.272
All of them are tying you to the
subconscious, to that horrifying atmosphere

00:09:03.473 --> 00:09:06.843
and you are not aware of it, you just
accept it.

00:09:07.044 --> 00:09:12.836
All kinds of these negative forces are
let loose.

00:09:15.216 --> 00:09:20.245
The other side are even more dangerous,
is the supraconscious area

00:09:20.446 --> 00:09:23.848
in our being on the right-hand side.

00:09:24.049 --> 00:09:29.551
In one side you put your emotions,
project them.

00:09:30.267 --> 00:09:34.408
When you project your emotions you can
go on to any limit.

00:09:34.609 --> 00:09:39.225
Like I have seen people who are crying
and weeping and wailing

00:09:39.426 --> 00:09:51.236
and reading horrible, very horrible poems
like Lord Byron, such people.

00:09:51.437 --> 00:09:58.544
They just throw you into that subconscious
where you feel happy to be miserable.

00:09:58.745 --> 00:10:04.198
You are happy as a miserable person, you
do not want anybody to be happy either.

00:10:04.399 --> 00:10:08.399
Aand you want to go on and continuing
with that dramatic romantic method,

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:10.609
by which you think you are a very
miserable people,

00:10:10.810 --> 00:10:15.741
and all the world is torturing you, and you
are a very nice person yourself.

00:10:15.942 --> 00:10:23.971
In this process you destroy yourself,
you destroy your being

00:10:24.172 --> 00:10:29.359
and you cover your Spirit completely
with your subconscious ideas.

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:32.076
You enjoy your miseries. Can you imagine?

00:10:32.277 --> 00:10:36.684
Even if joy stands before you, you will
say, “Oh, I don’t think I will be having”,

00:10:36.885 --> 00:10:41.196
which you are not aware of it, and you
just start enjoying!

00:10:41.397 --> 00:10:44.844
Now the other side [is] when you use
your rationality,

00:10:45.045 --> 00:10:48.387
which comes out of your brain.

00:10:52.006 --> 00:10:57.998
On one side you use your emotions out of
your heart – outward heart, I should say -

00:10:58.199 --> 00:11:01.333
and the other side you use your brain,
your rationality.

00:11:01.534 --> 00:11:06.963
You start ‘solving’ problems through
rationality, but it has no control.

00:11:07.704 --> 00:11:10.425
You can rationalise even a murder,
you can rationalise wars,

00:11:10.626 --> 00:11:14.839
you can rationalise everything, every sort
of aggression you do.

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:17.549
If you ask Russians, they will say
it is rationalised

00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:19.564
that they are aggressing Afghanistan.

00:11:19.772 --> 00:11:22.081
If you ask Americans, they said
it is rationalised

00:11:22.282 --> 00:11:27.888
that they are aggressing all the developing
countries.

00:11:28.089 --> 00:11:30.789
Everybody thinks they are absolutely
all right.

00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:35.117
Spanish people going down and destroying

00:11:35.318 --> 00:11:43.145
all the civilisations of Argentina, Peru
and all these places.

00:11:43.346 --> 00:11:45.795
Or the English thinking that [if] they
don’t like somebody,

00:11:45.996 --> 00:11:49.276
so they have a business - all right,
if they say, “We don’t like it,”

00:11:49.477 --> 00:11:51.123
they have a business to say whatever
they like,

00:11:51.324 --> 00:11:56.053
to ill-treat anyone they feel like. They
can do it because they don’t like it.

00:11:56.254 --> 00:11:59.137
Or any other such people.

00:11:59.346 --> 00:12:03.819
So in the developing countries more
the subconscious works out, much more,

00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:07.911
and in the developed countries,
the supraconscious works out.

00:12:08.112 --> 00:12:13.530
Both are just the same. Both are
in the same darkness.

00:12:13.731 --> 00:12:16.634
There is no difference; only the colour
may be different.

00:12:16.835 --> 00:12:19.605
One we can say, in the black fumes
of the coal,

00:12:19.806 --> 00:12:24.235
and another in the yellow fumes
of the benzoin,

00:12:24.436 --> 00:12:27.232
both are equally suffocating.

00:12:27.433 --> 00:12:31.685
The another side, the right side, is more
dangerous

00:12:31.886 --> 00:12:35.922
because it doesn’t show any signs.
It’s ego.

00:12:36.123 --> 00:12:40.073
You think it is rational. You start solving
problems rationally.

00:12:40.274 --> 00:12:47.990
Where do you end up? In quarrels,
squabbles, fighting, killing, violence.

00:12:48.725 --> 00:12:52.374
Any organisation that is based on these
two things,

00:12:52.575 --> 00:12:58.224
whatever may be their intentions, good
or bad, they end up like this.

00:12:58.425 --> 00:13:06.090
On one side, they go into intrigues,
slyness and lethargy.

00:13:06.291 --> 00:13:13.903
The other side they go into violence.
Or also they can change hands.

00:13:14.104 --> 00:13:16.792
Some lethargic people can be extremely
violent,

00:13:16.993 --> 00:13:22.355
but because they are so lethargic, that
they take time to react.

00:13:22.556 --> 00:13:25.080
It’s not easy to make lethargic people
very violent,

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:29.536
because they haven’t got so much willpower
left in them.

00:13:29.737 --> 00:13:33.891
The another side, the supraconscious,
is so dangerously placed.

00:13:34.092 --> 00:13:37.093
Now this is managed by many gurus.

00:13:37.294 --> 00:13:39.943
Of course, as I told you, psychic side
is also managed

00:13:40.144 --> 00:13:46.051
by many gurus who say that through sex
you can achieve God.

00:13:47.414 --> 00:13:49.862
I am not denouncing sex by any chance.

00:13:50.063 --> 00:13:56.297
What I am saying the moderation of sex,
the sanctity of sex, has to be there.

00:13:56.498 --> 00:14:01.294
On the right-hand side, I am not denying
rationality,

00:14:01.495 --> 00:14:03.869
but rationality should be wisdom.

00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:09.064
If there is no wisdom, rationality can be
very dangerous.

00:14:09.265 --> 00:14:13.617
But the danger comes not from you yourself,
but more from outside:

00:14:13.818 --> 00:14:17.308
when you penetrate into that projection,

00:14:17.509 --> 00:14:20.719
you are controlled through your
limitations.

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:24.582
You can see here the left- and right-hand
side, ego and superego.

00:14:24.783 --> 00:14:27.575
It’s like a balloon. And the balloon moves
like that,

00:14:27.776 --> 00:14:30.698
keeps you with you, like this, and another
balloon moves like that,

00:14:30.899 --> 00:14:35.056
and both the balloons are pulling you
on both the sides.

00:14:35.488 --> 00:14:38.593
They give you mantras. These mantras
are nothing

00:14:38.803 --> 00:14:43.632
but projections of your rationality,
your mind.

00:14:43.833 --> 00:14:48.336
We call them black magic, in one simple
word.

00:14:48.537 --> 00:14:51.848
Or you can call one as yellow magic,
another as black magic,

00:14:52.049 --> 00:14:57.218
whichever way you like. All these are
the same thing.

00:14:57.419 --> 00:15:01.673
And with this projection, people can kill.

00:15:01.874 --> 00:15:05.392
Sitting down here, people can kill.

00:15:05.593 --> 00:15:10.922
They can do whatever they like, sitting
down here, and they call it as power!

00:15:11.123 --> 00:15:17.711
Now, this supraconscious area people cover
when they are fond of power,

00:15:18.878 --> 00:15:22.504
when they want to have power. Now they
have had, supposing, political powers;

00:15:22.705 --> 00:15:28.078
but they want to intrigue and, what you
call, espionage people.

00:15:28.279 --> 00:15:32.008
I mean, imagine, these filthy things
people do, imagine.

00:15:32.209 --> 00:15:37.937
This is politics, supposed to be, espionage
and all that.

00:15:38.138 --> 00:15:42.871
These all filthy things are done by people
who want power,

00:15:43.072 --> 00:15:45.718
more power and more power and more powers.

00:15:45.919 --> 00:15:54.095
And this power is also, ultimately is
destroying the whole.

00:15:54.296 --> 00:15:58.172
One destroys the individual; the other
destroys the whole.

00:15:58.373 --> 00:16:02.574
Hitler now, for example, was nothing
but obsessed by these.

00:16:02.775 --> 00:16:06.726
And he got these powers through his
own projections.

00:16:06.927 --> 00:16:10.021
He started mesmerising people, he gave
them wrong ideas,

00:16:10.222 --> 00:16:13.548
he created a war and the whole world
was shaken up.

00:16:13.764 --> 00:16:16.427
It can happen to anyone.

00:16:16.628 --> 00:16:19.340
But now people don’t want to take his name.

00:16:19.541 --> 00:16:25.926
They shudder to think what a devil he was.
But he became a devil.

00:16:27.427 --> 00:16:32.676
These powers are around. So those who
want to overpower things -

00:16:32.877 --> 00:16:34.883
now those who want to say fly,

00:16:35.084 --> 00:16:40.241
or those who want to have supra-natural
powers, they call them,

00:16:40.442 --> 00:16:47.215
like you can hold a truck coming. What is
the need to hold a truck?

00:16:47.626 --> 00:16:50.120
You can allow an elephant to pass over
your body.

00:16:50.321 --> 00:16:53.848
I don’t understand what is the need for
an elephant to pass over your body.

00:16:54.049 --> 00:16:58.732
How many elephants do you have in this
country?

00:16:59.669 --> 00:17:03.013
And where will you face such an accident?

00:17:03.214 --> 00:17:07.789
Such people when they overdo it, they
develop these so-called powers

00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:10.436
of killing others. They will create
accidents,

00:17:10.637 --> 00:17:15.805
they create accidents, they kill people,
they do all kinds of things.

00:17:18.091 --> 00:17:21.015
This is all known to Indians.

00:17:21.216 --> 00:17:26.115
Those who have read a little about it,
they know all these things exist.

00:17:26.316 --> 00:17:30.583
You are people, you are still naïve.
You do not know.

00:17:31.344 --> 00:17:34.293
Indians, also modern, westernised Indians
also don’t know.

00:17:34.494 --> 00:17:37.477
They think they are all Shakespeare.

00:17:37.678 --> 00:17:41.116
They don’t read anything about their
own knowledge.

00:17:41.322 --> 00:17:46.878
This is what it is. Now what is
the antidote for this?

00:17:47.543 --> 00:17:52.119
The antidote of all this is Divine love.

00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:55.281
Love can conquer all these devils.

00:17:55.482 --> 00:17:58.255
If a person has this Divine love within
him,

00:17:58.456 --> 00:18:04.125
if it starts flowing through him, all these
things will disappear.

00:18:04.539 --> 00:18:09.638
That’s the only way you can save this
world, through Divine love.

00:18:09.839 --> 00:18:14.098
Only through love you are going to win
over all these

00:18:14.299 --> 00:18:17.812
horrible forces which are let loose,

00:18:18.013 --> 00:18:22.749
and your confidence will be established
in you, too.

00:18:24.907 --> 00:18:28.902
This Divine love is all-pervading.

00:18:29.103 --> 00:18:33.755
The trouble is human beings are not
aware of it.

00:18:33.956 --> 00:18:40.046
It’s the most dynamic force and is the only
force that exists.

00:18:40.247 --> 00:18:42.670
Darkness exists till the light is not
there.

00:18:42.871 --> 00:18:47.467
It has otherwise no existence. It is
a myth.

00:18:48.159 --> 00:18:54.555
In the same way, when the light of Divine
love starts flowing in you,

00:18:54.756 --> 00:18:58.848
when you become identified with that
Divine love,

00:18:59.049 --> 00:19:03.604
then all these negative forces drop out.

00:19:03.805 --> 00:19:08.323
The mantras, so-called mantras, that they
have taught to you,

00:19:08.524 --> 00:19:18.689
which are used to invite these horrible
entities, disappear into thin air,

00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:26.476
and actually the Deities which are to be
awakened, they get awakened.

00:19:26.677 --> 00:19:33.650
Say the fire that may completely demolish
a place,

00:19:33.851 --> 00:19:41.103
becomes a fire in the lamp, when you see
where to put the fire.

00:19:41.304 --> 00:19:53.370
This light of Divine love should come
to every one of the person

00:19:53.571 --> 00:19:58.283
who is seeking truth. This is what we
are seeking.

00:19:58.484 --> 00:20:04.800
This Divine love should flow through you,

00:20:05.356 --> 00:20:08.180
by which you are going to save the whole
world.

00:20:08.381 --> 00:20:12.760
It’s a very dangerous and precarious
condition.

00:20:12.961 --> 00:20:19.196
Those who are realised souls and real
truthful people

00:20:19.397 --> 00:20:25.919
are hiding themselves in the Himalayas or
some sort of caves somewhere in the world.

00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:28.597
They don’t want to face you because they
think you are too dark

00:20:28.798 --> 00:20:30.748
and your projections are like two horns,

00:20:30.949 --> 00:20:36.653
and you, as soon as you’ll see them, you’ll
come down like a bull on them.

00:20:37.767 --> 00:20:42.456
You need tremendous patience and
tremendous understanding

00:20:42.657 --> 00:20:49.094
and courage like a mountain to face
all these things.

00:20:50.931 --> 00:20:53.585
God has made all arrangements within you.

00:20:53.786 --> 00:20:56.525
You can see yourself [what] has been
shown here.

00:20:56.726 --> 00:21:01.527
I am sure Chaya must have told you about
it: that there is a power within us

00:21:01.728 --> 00:21:04.679
which can give us Self-realisation,
by which

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:11.555
we can achieve that source of Divine love,

00:21:11.756 --> 00:21:15.297
and you become the river of that Divine
love;

00:21:15.498 --> 00:21:17.923
so that you are cleansed completely

00:21:18.124 --> 00:21:25.228
and that others who are to face you, are
also cleansed.

00:21:25.429 --> 00:21:32.127
Every time I have to repeat about Kundalini
and about these things,

00:21:32.328 --> 00:21:37.526
but I am sure you can go through the book
and see for yourself

00:21:37.726 --> 00:21:39.664
what are all these things.

00:21:39.865 --> 00:21:43.502
But the emergency is today, that we have
to realise

00:21:43.703 --> 00:21:48.917
that this Divine love has to be brought

00:21:49.118 --> 00:21:52.549
into the awareness of human beings, into
their consciousness,

00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:58.605
so that they can manoeuvre it and can once
for all win over,

00:21:58.806 --> 00:22:04.828
be victorious over this dreadful enemy
of the whole.

00:22:05.029 --> 00:22:08.718
May God bless you. Thank you.

00:22:09.008 --> 00:22:11.327
Douglas?

00:22:13.946 --> 00:22:16.784
I used to say always that, “How it will
work out?”,

00:22:16.985 --> 00:22:19.292
because it was moving very slowly.

00:22:19.493 --> 00:22:21.251
Very few people get Realisation

00:22:21.452 --> 00:22:25.267
in this country specially, and they go up
and down

00:22:25.468 --> 00:22:28.985
and [it’s] difficult to establish them.
This is a fact.

00:22:29.210 --> 00:22:35.199
But we are establishing slowly, steadily
and firmly.

00:22:35.836 --> 00:22:37.618
And everybody was very much worried that,

00:22:37.819 --> 00:22:40.874
“Mother, how are you going to do it in such
a big way?”

00:22:41.075 --> 00:22:47.418
Or, “Is the Western people out of your
programme?”

00:22:47.619 --> 00:22:50.207
And I always told them, “It will spark
one day,”

00:22:50.424 --> 00:22:53.506
and I think the first spark I have seen
now.

00:22:53.707 --> 00:22:58.604
I am very happy to tell you about that,
that a gentleman who came from Australia,

00:22:58.805 --> 00:23:01.181
two of them came to India –

00:23:01.381 --> 00:23:04.738
they got their Realisation – they went back
to Australia.

00:23:04.939 --> 00:23:07.814
They gave Realisation to people.

00:23:08.015 --> 00:23:12.486
And today I’ve received a letter from
an American gentleman

00:23:12.687 --> 00:23:15.592
who went to Australia who has a big
organisation of his own,

00:23:15.793 --> 00:23:18.061
who got [his] Realisation.

00:23:18.262 --> 00:23:21.132
And he has written to say, a very beautiful
letter he has written.

00:23:21.333 --> 00:23:23.505
I wish somebody could read it for you

00:23:23.706 --> 00:23:26.999
so that you will know how the spark
has started.

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:30.214
Can you hand me my purse?

00:23:30.819 --> 00:23:36.068
How is Jane? Have you got any report
about it? My purse.

00:23:36.269 --> 00:23:44.801
Sahaj Yogini: [Indistinct]
Shri Mataji: All right. Good.

00:23:45.002 --> 00:23:48.081
But now you are going there, I would like
to warn you [about] one thing:

00:23:48.282 --> 00:23:51.307
don’t talk about other negative forces,
all right?

00:23:51.508 --> 00:23:55.455
Like the Buddhist chanting and all these
chantings and all that.

00:23:55.664 --> 00:23:59.500
Keep it very pure. Eh? Thank you.

00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:02.898
I will just go through it. Very sweet
of him,

00:24:03.099 --> 00:24:05.798
just see how much he is working hard.

00:24:05.999 --> 00:24:09.993
Only two persons have created such a thing
in Australia, you see?

00:24:10.194 --> 00:24:15.328
You used to say that Australians are
the convicts who went from here.

00:24:15.529 --> 00:24:19.313
It’s just the other way round now, I think.

00:24:19.514 --> 00:24:22.602
They are proving to be such beautiful
people - now.

00:24:22.803 --> 00:24:27.257
Somebody who can read very clearly, who?

00:24:33.277 --> 00:24:35.985
Can you put it up for him?

00:24:38.222 --> 00:24:40.086
“Dear Beloved Mataji,

00:24:40.287 --> 00:24:43.093
Please excuse the delay in writing You

00:24:43.309 --> 00:24:48.224
as I have been away in Australia with
the message of love and understanding,

00:24:48.425 --> 00:24:55.003
with the work of polarity and Jin Shin
and Living Foods.

00:24:55.204 --> 00:24:58.542
I met Warren Reeves while in Sydney.

00:24:58.743 --> 00:25:00.826
It was not a planned meeting

00:25:01.027 --> 00:25:05.394
and the spontaneous nature of it fills
my soul with joy.

00:25:05.595 --> 00:25:08.316
Upon entering his home, I felt the presence

00:25:08.517 --> 00:25:11.692
of the energy that comes through You.

00:25:11.893 --> 00:25:14.745
It was very powerful to feel this love.

00:25:14.946 --> 00:25:18.423
Even as I type this letter, I sense Your
presence

00:25:18.624 --> 00:25:22.888
and all of the people who have joined me
in my Realisation.

00:25:23.089 --> 00:25:27.404
There is much pain in growing, and I accept
the challenge.

00:25:27.605 --> 00:25:30.369
The experiences since experiencing

00:25:30.608 --> 00:25:33.319
Realisation have been very profound.

00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:36.429
Love is the main ingredient of my sharing

00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:41.745
and I am able to transmit it more fully
since Realisation.

00:25:41.946 --> 00:25:44.873
I am understanding more and sharing
this Realisation

00:25:45.073 --> 00:25:47.991
with those who are drawn to it.

00:25:48.198 --> 00:25:51.410
Many positive experiences have unfolded

00:25:51.611 --> 00:25:54.196
while in Australia and in America.

00:25:54.397 --> 00:25:58.520
My consciousness seems reborn. Thank You.

00:25:58.721 --> 00:26:04.079
I am enclosing information about
the organisation that I founded.

00:26:04.288 --> 00:26:07.585
It is called the International Holistic
Centre

00:26:07.786 --> 00:26:11.178
and I plan to put it in the hands
of the right person

00:26:11.379 --> 00:26:16.541
who comes to take this responsibility.
Why I tell this to You

00:26:16.742 --> 00:26:21.359
is because of the possibility of Your being
helped by this organisation

00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:23.857
upon Your coming to America.

00:26:24.058 --> 00:26:27.853
When You are ready to come to America,
write to the organisation.

00:26:28.054 --> 00:26:31.334
I will share with the new director that You
might write,

00:26:31.535 --> 00:26:34.562
and he could be helpful to You. Please know

00:26:34.762 --> 00:26:38.057
that I will do anything I am able to make
this visit

00:26:38.258 --> 00:26:41.575
to America a sharing one. Warren has
mentioned

00:26:41.776 --> 00:26:44.793
that this organisation could be a vital
link

00:26:44.994 --> 00:26:47.747
in the chain of Your coming to America.

00:26:47.948 --> 00:26:51.258
My plans see me moving to Honolulu

00:26:51.459 --> 00:26:54.087
for a time and then moving to Australia
to work

00:26:54.288 --> 00:26:56.931
with many in the light of the love energy.

00:26:57.132 --> 00:26:59.927
May I hear from You soon, if possible,

00:27:00.128 --> 00:27:02.502
and shall Your blessed work continue

00:27:02.703 --> 00:27:05.739
with the strength that I felt in Warren’s
presence.

00:27:05.939 --> 00:27:11.124
May I be in Your grace and love always.
Thank you.”

00:27:11.325 --> 00:27:13.434
Shri Mataji: Read the name of the gentleman
please,

00:27:13.635 --> 00:27:18.493
and show his photograph.
Sahaj Yogi: Stan Telson.

00:27:19.209 --> 00:27:22.707
Shri Mataji: See what a powerful man we
have got now with us.

00:27:22.939 --> 00:27:27.947
Sahaja Yogi: International Holistic Centre,
Arizona.

00:27:28.148 --> 00:27:29.722
Shri Mataji: There were a lot of things
published about him.

00:27:29.922 --> 00:27:31.370
He’s sent his newspaper cuttings,

00:27:31.571 --> 00:27:38.795
but this is his photograph; see, after
Realisation.

00:27:38.995 --> 00:27:41.778
You can see that clearly. See.

00:27:42.002 --> 00:27:44.738
This is how it is going to spark now.
Let’s see.

00:27:44.939 --> 00:27:49.217
Sahaja Yogi: Yes. Thank You.

00:27:50.005 --> 00:27:52.809
Shri Mataji: Any questions?

00:27:56.412 --> 00:27:59.476
Ask the questions.

00:27:59.754 --> 00:28:03.717
I am your Mother. There is nothing to be
frightened of me here.

00:28:03.918 --> 00:28:06.966
I didn’t want to frighten you, but that’s
a fact.

00:28:07.167 --> 00:28:08.792
That’s a fact we have to understand.

00:28:08.993 --> 00:28:12.849
All these horrible spells, and these
magic things,

00:28:13.050 --> 00:28:14.907
and the all that nonsense is going on;

00:28:15.108 --> 00:28:17.200
in the Western countries it’s much more,

00:28:17.401 --> 00:28:19.807
because such saints are born here.

00:28:20.008 --> 00:28:24.910
Don’t be enticed by them. Be careful.

00:28:28.706 --> 00:28:32.047
Is there any question? Seeker: No, that
was just my indigestion… here.

00:28:32.248 --> 00:28:35.847
Shri Mataji: Beg your pardon?
Seeker: No, just my indigestion… here.

00:28:36.047 --> 00:28:38.417
Shri Mataji: What’s it?
Sahaj Yogi: It was his stomach rumbling.

00:28:38.618 --> 00:28:42.230
Shri Mataji: Eh?
Sahaj Yogi: It was his stomach rumbling.

00:28:42.431 --> 00:28:45.341
Shri Mataji: Is it? Stomach is rumbling.

00:28:45.542 --> 00:28:49.526
All right, you put your left hand
on the stomach.

00:28:49.727 --> 00:28:54.000
Kundalini has come there. You see?
She is trying to cure you.

00:28:54.201 --> 00:28:58.013
Right hand towards me, like this.

00:28:58.214 --> 00:29:00.635
What else?

00:29:02.969 --> 00:29:06.551
You see, we have been playing havoc
with ourselves, isn’t it?

00:29:06.752 --> 00:29:10.849
And sometimes we also spoil our liver,
sometimes our pancreas.

00:29:11.050 --> 00:29:12.928
If you are very hard-working man,
a planner,

00:29:13.129 --> 00:29:16.060
your pancreas could be spoiled, you see,
and something,

00:29:16.261 --> 00:29:22.424
so Kundalini, She goes and supplies
the energy to get it all right.

00:29:23.269 --> 00:29:24.830
You’ve got cool breeze in the hand?

00:29:25.031 --> 00:29:27.486
Are you getting cool breeze in the hand?

00:29:27.687 --> 00:29:29.420
Cool breeze in the hand, are you getting?
No.

00:29:29.621 --> 00:29:32.342
Just put both the feet straight like that
on the ground.

00:29:32.549 --> 00:29:36.280
Yes, fully. Just move a little further
like this.

00:29:36.488 --> 00:29:40.597
Yes, put straight, you see. Keep the feet
straight.

00:29:40.798 --> 00:29:47.182
But - yes, sit in such a way that little
bit pressure on the feet should be there.

00:29:47.383 --> 00:29:51.083
Pull, pull them towards you. Yes, now see,
that’s how.

00:29:51.284 --> 00:29:55.286
Put both the hands, like that.
