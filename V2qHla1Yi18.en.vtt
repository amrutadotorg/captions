00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:13.960
Today we have gathered here to do Guru puja.
This system started long time back in India,

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:25.250
I think even at the time of Patanjali, maybe
even earlier, when there were great seekers.

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:37.290
And their gurus were sitting in the jungles,
where they used to get permission to go there

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:47.190
and then they would get their realisation,
very few of them, one or two. So we had many

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:54.190
rishis and munis in the olden times in India.
So this system of guru started. Also one of

00:00:57.749 --> 00:01:04.749
the reasons is that, that there is no organised
religion in India. There’s no popes, there

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:12.430
are no priests, nothing like them. They have
priests just for worshipping in the temples.

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:22.970
But for giving realisation, for talking about
higher life, they all had to go to very great

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:36.310
realised souls. And it was absolutely the
freedom of the guru, whom to accept whom not

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:44.259
to accept. And everybody was tested thoroughly
by the guru if they are capable of achieving

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:56.259
Self-realisation or not. And this test was
so hard, so difficult, and also to a point

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:07.299
of cruelty, that very few could pass through
that test.

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:14.299
It’s not like Sahaja Yoga, everybody is
a Sahaja Yogi, it’s not like that. That,

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:21.710
of course, made it a very narrow margin for
people to achieve their realisation and these

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:31.970
gurus never used to leave their own seats,
they call it takiya (meaning: pillow). They

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:37.760
would be there in their own place, all those
who would like to go to him could come. If

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:44.760
he allowed, then only they can meet him. You
may go on for miles together, nothing, no

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:53.090
obligations of the guru that he should meet
you. Perhaps they didn’t feel that love

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:05.650
and compassion for the seekers. They didn’t
understand that the seekers are ardently seeking

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:16.560
the truth and they should not suffer. That
may be the reason they were not so much concerned.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:27.280
All the time they were testing their disciple.
Even Ramdas, who was the guru of Shivaji,

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:35.740
was testing even Shivaji for so many times,
though he was a born realised.

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:45.370
So to get this Gurupada, to the position of
a guru, after that they had to work very,

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:52.370
very hard to achieve a state of a saint. But
in Sahaja Yoga that is not the case, as you

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:05.240
know. I just thought – if people get their
realisation, they’ll see for themselves

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:13.490
what’s wrong with them, they will introspect
themselves and will try to correct themselves.

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:20.490
It is true, for many, many people, but some
of them still are lingering behind and are

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:27.919
going on and on and on thinking that they
are Sahaja Yogis, they have achieved a lot,

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:34.919
they are something very special. So this delusion
is all the time is creating this problem.

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:44.789
This delusion makes them very narrow minded,
selfish, self-centred, and people can’t

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:56.280
believe how can they be Sahaja Yogis.

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:02.259
So the first and foremost thing we have to
know that this Sahaja Yoga has worked out

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:09.259
because Paramchaitanya is transmitting compassion,
It never did before, It never had that kind

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:18.930
of an attitude which it is there because I
am a Mother. And this compassion has worked

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:27.830
it this way that: you all have got your realisation,
you have achieved a state which we can call

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:35.360
as a Self-realised souls. But still, because
you got it so easily, cheaply, I think still

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:46.719
we don’t realise what we have got. Still
we do not practice meditation, introspection

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:58.150
and dedication. Some are very much there,
but mostly we are just living in the idea

00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:05.029
that we have already achieved.

00:06:05.029 --> 00:06:12.029
So, the first thing we should introspect:
Are we concerned about ourselves? All the

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:26.710
time do we think that we are suffering, we
have this problem, that problem, or this should

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:34.710
be done, that should be done. If the attention
is on that, that all the time you are worried

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:42.340
about yourself, then you cannot break, you
cannot break through this shell of your being,

00:06:47.889 --> 00:06:54.889
which is under the domination of your mental
selfishness or self-centredness. Even self-centredness

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:02.349
is absolutely against your growth.

00:07:02.349 --> 00:07:09.129
There are many people who come, I have seen,
even to Cabella, I know they have to suffer

00:07:09.129 --> 00:07:16.129
a lot because they think it’s a very open
space where they have to live and they must

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:21.259
make all arrangements to make themselves comfortable.
Such people have to grow still much more.

00:07:21.259 --> 00:07:28.259
For a saint, any place has to be heavenly.
You must have seen Me enjoying everything.

00:07:32.539 --> 00:07:39.180
I can live anywhere, I can sleep anywhere.
I have no demands of any kind. But if you

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:46.180
are worried about your body comforts or your
body troubles then still you are at a body

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:55.110
level, which you have to transcend. Worried
about how you look, how you dress up, what

00:07:58.719 --> 00:08:05.719
sort of things you have to wear: all this
makes you yet not a good Sahaja Yogi. This

00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:21.050
is one style of Sahaja Yogis who still want
very great comforts.

00:08:21.129 --> 00:08:28.129
So, what you have to do, if you are used to
comforts: try to go and sleep on the street.

00:08:31.889 --> 00:08:38.889
I will not do that, but you can do it. Or
sleep on a tree, you may fall down doesn’t

00:08:42.290 --> 00:08:49.290
matter (laughter). Do all kinds of things
that are necessary to punish your body to

00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:58.060
understand that you are not bound with this
comfort of the body. This is one of the greatest

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:07.600
things one has to see, that you are not bound
by your body. It’s alright if you have comfort,

00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:14.780
well and good, if you don’t have, well and
good. For a Sahaja Yogi it is very important

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:21.780
that he should be able to live like a saint.
Not necessarily that you should become a sanyasi,

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:30.820
but from inside your body should be such that
you can dominate your body. How can you not

00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:39.460
sleep anywhere? Why can you not sleep anywhere?

00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:46.460
Then also, that they want to have a very comfortable
arrangements about bathrooms, this, that.

00:09:54.950 --> 00:10:01.240
All these ideas are there because you are
very self-conscious but not superconsciousness,

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:08.240
it’s not there. You want to have everything
first class, and anybody who tries to interfere

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:14.910
with that kind of a thing, you don’t like
it. I can understand a person who is very

00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:21.910
old – he cannot manage things, he has to
have a certain amount of body comfort, but

00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:32.180
even young people these days are extremely
comfort-oriented. That is not for Sahaja Yoga.

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:43.650
Of course I’ve seen people in the West are
better off in this matter. Because when they

00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:50.650
go to India they told Me they like [Maharashtra]
S.T. buses better than comfortable buses.

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:55.290
So I said “Why?” “Because Mother, you
can jump in the bus nicely with all the luggage,”

00:10:55.290 --> 00:11:01.370
(due to lack of suspension and bumps in road)
“Because the windows are open, you can breathe.

00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:08.250
Very natural, very good“. And they wanted
to go on bullock carts also. I mean they enjoy

00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:09.790
all that.

00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:15.330
Actually if you see you’ll notice, in the
Western World mostly, people are taking to

00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:22.330
a more rustic life. They are enjoying more
the rustic style of life than to this so-called

00:11:22.450 --> 00:11:29.450
comfortable, artificial life. Not so much
Indians, I would say, also Malaysians. I think

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:38.160
most of the people I have met in the Western
countries are really great because they can

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:45.590
sleep anywhere, they can eat anything. You
ask them “How did you like the food?”

00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:52.590
“What did we eat, I don’t know Mother?”
That is the sign. That is the sign of a person

00:11:54.180 --> 00:12:01.180
who is not bothered as to what he is eating,
what he’s getting, what is his taste, “I

00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:09.170
like this, I like that,” these words drop
out.

00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:16.170
It’s not difficult, it’s not difficult,
you might think that I am asking you to something,

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:23.150
hazardous thing, you see. It’s not difficult
at all, because if you have to impress the

00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:30.150
people around you, you have to be like a saint.
And if you are a fussy person, if you are

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:38.720
a fusspot, then you cannot impress others
that you have got Self-realisation.

00:12:39.610 --> 00:12:44.640
Many people tell Me “Mother, people had
to do so much: to go to Himalayas, do this,

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:50.040
do that, and then they got their realisation.
How is it these people you have blessed?”

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:57.040
Even some great saints asked Me that. “What
right they had to get their realisation? Why

00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:03.930
did you give them realisation? What have they
achieved?” I said “Only their desire.

00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:09.060
Their desire was very much there that they
should get their Self-realisation and that’s

00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:11.670
how they got it“.

00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:18.670
But now to go into only desire, is not sufficient.
You have to depend on yourself, on the light

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:30.250
of your Spirit you should see what’s wrong
with you. This is a very important thing.

00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:37.250
Ask questions to yourself. “Why do I want
this? Why do I need this? What is the purpose?”

00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:45.240
Because as you have seen, all the rest of
the world is mad, [we] call it mad, because

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:52.240
they are running after stupid things, they
are wanting things which has no meaning to

00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:56.800
spirituality.

00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:03.800
So spirituality itself should be self-satisfying.
If you are spiritually endowed, then you are

00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:12.460
self-satisfied. And this self-satisfaction
within you will lead you to that Ocean of

00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:20.410
Joy about which I have been telling you and
all the scriptures have described. For Sahaja

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:29.600
Yogis, the word we use is nirananda. Nirananda
means: A joyous state, where nothing is needed.

00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:44.020
Joy itself is joy. You are enjoying only joy.
Nothing is needed to make you happy. You are

00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:53.110
happy because of joy that you have, in the
nirananda state.

00:14:53.620 --> 00:15:00.620
If you go and see how these saints lived,
you will be amazed. How they managed their

00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:08.510
life, you’ll be very much amazed. How many
days they used to fast, without food. Never

00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:14.610
bothered! They never thought it was fasting.
They just used to think, “We have no food,

00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:20.480
so no, don’t eat.” Of course, you don’t
have to go through [that], you have got your

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:27.480
realisation. So now you have a power to achieve
this mastery. Now, you have this power.

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:36.240
The another thing I have noticed about Sahaja
Yogis, some of them have grudges about others.

00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:45.930
Sahaja Yoga is the blessings of love, blessings
of compassion. There is no place for any kind

00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:05.860
of hatred, or any kind of revenge, or anger
among Sahaja Yogis. If you have that, you

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:19.720
must conquer it. Is a good chance, if you
find somebody who is very hot-tempered, who

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:29.000
is a very angry type, go and make friends
with that person. Just see if you can carry

00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:36.620
on with that person or not. If there’s a
fusspot, also make friends with such a fusspot,

00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:43.620
and see that you achieve that peace which
will keep you above all kinds of hatred, all

00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:52.710
kinds of temper, which is a very bad thing.

00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:59.000
But some Sahaja Yogis lose their temper very
fast. I would say that they cannot be Sahaja

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:06.000
Yogis, because if you have no control over
your anger, then how are you powerful of compassion

00:17:08.669 --> 00:17:15.669
and love? But you don’t even have to control
it – just there. Once you have it, or that

00:17:16.789 --> 00:17:23.789
state, then you just watch and see. In the
olden days, the saints ,mostly, used to be

00:17:26.350 --> 00:17:33.350
very much angry type people. They couldn’t
bear the stupidity of the world and they used

00:17:34.059 --> 00:17:39.600
to be very, very angry type and they used
to run away from people.

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:46.600
I know of a saint, Nityanandswami, who always
lived on the tree, and anybody tried to come

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:54.480
near him, he used to throw stones at. Couldn’t
bear the people who were all heated up and

00:17:55.320 --> 00:18:02.320
coming to him. But you don’t need that,
you have a way of achieving love and affection

00:18:04.450 --> 00:18:11.450
of the people who seem to be very, very troublesome
and grudging type or maybe some people who

00:18:12.999 --> 00:18:19.999
are very aggressive. This is not a difficult
task if you try a little bit the other way

00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:25.789
round. Mostly people, when they find somebody
who is a very hot-tempered person, they run

00:18:25.789 --> 00:18:32.789
away from them. They don’t want to have
anything to do [with them]. Those who are

00:18:33.090 --> 00:18:40.090
not hot-tempered, those who are good nature,
you can always be friendly, what is so great

00:18:40.999 --> 00:18:47.999
about it? What is so nice about it? What is
so sweet about it? But how you speak to the

00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:05.080
person, how you talk to that person, how you
manage that person: your love will definitely

00:19:07.419 --> 00:19:13.360
melt him down, because he’s a Sahaja Yogi,
I’m not saying for non-sahaja yogis. Sahaja

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:20.360
Yogis as they are, you have to be extremely
compassionate and affectionate and love.

00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:34.960
Another thing which is extremely important
for us to know, that we have got this realisation

00:19:36.549 --> 00:19:43.549
through Mother’s love. Only My compassion
has acted, only the power of Mother’s compassion

00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:51.230
could have worked it out. Now, even if this
love is flowing towards the stones, or towards

00:19:52.899 --> 00:19:59.899
the mountains or towards anything which is
very solid, the ripples come back, they have

00:20:03.029 --> 00:20:10.029
to come back. In the same way, you people
now, who have got realisation, have to know

00:20:10.169 --> 00:20:17.169
that compassion and love is the only power
you have got, nothing else.

00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:24.590
If you love yourself, if you care for yourself,
you care for your family and care for your

00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:34.090
children – then you haven’t achieved much.
You’re only worried about yourself, because

00:20:35.789 --> 00:20:42.789
that’s your limited area where you move.
But if you can break that and find out places

00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:54.340
where you have to express your love, you can.
As they say, the water finds it’s own level.

00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:04.960
In the same way, this compassion has to flow
to all the places, to all the ditches everywhere,

00:21:05.850 --> 00:21:12.850
and should find its own level. But if you
are just satisfied with yourself and you are

00:21:13.570 --> 00:21:20.570
not bothered, you are just trying to believe
that you are a great soul because, you are

00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:30.110
a Sahaja Yogi, then I must say, that you are
sadly mistaken.

00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:37.460
In this lifetime, you can achieve that state.
In this lifetime, you can get to that state

00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:42.110
within yourself.

00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:49.110
Now, the third thing that troubles Sahaja
Yogis is that, “Mother we want God’s realisation,”

00:21:50.279 --> 00:21:57.279
that makes Me laugh. You see, it is already
there, already there. Like once you get into

00:21:59.909 --> 00:22:04.929
the sea and you say “Mother, we want to
go to the bottom of the sea,” you can always

00:22:04.929 --> 00:22:11.929
go, just slip, and you will be there. In the
same way, once you have developed a kind of

00:22:14.789 --> 00:22:21.789
a Self-realisation and have jumped into the
ocean of this compassion, there’s no need

00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:28.990
to achieve anything. The sense of achievement,
“I should be that, I should be this,”

00:22:28.990 --> 00:22:35.990
is all coming from your human haunting. That
should be over. Now you are Godly people.

00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:41.679
So you should not think, “I should achieve
this state, I should achieve that state,”

00:22:41.679 --> 00:22:47.769
but just go on slipping, just giving up all
the weights that you have in your heads and

00:22:47.769 --> 00:22:54.769
it will work out. This is what I have been
saying to you that: you have to dissolve yourself

00:22:56.309 --> 00:23:00.690
into the compassion.

00:23:00.690 --> 00:23:07.690
Also, there are still very people who want
to be in the front. Specially Indians will

00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:16.710
all sit together in front, I’ve seen that
way. They have no right, they have no right

00:23:18.629 --> 00:23:25.629
to sit in front. Nobody has right to sit in
front or to seek a place. They should sit

00:23:27.869 --> 00:23:34.869
wherever they get seat to sit down with complete
satisfaction. Whether you sit in front or

00:23:37.009 --> 00:23:44.009
at that corner, even in the darkness, you
can get My vibrations, you can get everything.

00:23:45.690 --> 00:23:52.690
So to be prominent, to sit some place where
you are prominent, is not necessary. What

00:23:53.519 --> 00:24:00.519
is it in a prominence, what do you get? To
be lost into the crowds, to be lost into the

00:24:04.139 --> 00:24:11.139
Ocean of Love is the main thing. All these
are mythical that, we should somehow or other

00:24:13.269 --> 00:24:20.269
get the front place. You see as Marathi apan
manto (We say), “Samor chi zaaga patkauli

00:24:25.610 --> 00:24:32.610
mi!” means “I have managed to get the
front seat!” Front will be the back, and

00:24:34.049 --> 00:24:38.299
back will be the front.

00:24:38.299 --> 00:24:45.299
It is very surprising how still people are
trying to achieve something so nonsensical.

00:24:49.230 --> 00:24:55.929
So where is your mind, where is your attention,
what are you thinking? If you are thoughtless

00:24:55.929 --> 00:25:02.929
you will be satisfied, you will be happy,
you will not ask for anything, you’ll not

00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:10.470
want anything. What is there to have? What
is so important? All these ideas come from

00:25:14.110 --> 00:25:16.429
ignorance, I must tell you, from ignorance.

00:25:16.429 --> 00:25:23.429
Once this ‘Hare Rama Hare Krishna’ fellow
came to Me. And he said that “We have heard

00:25:23.850 --> 00:25:29.700
you are a great saint, this thing, that thing,
and you have all the comforts of life – you

00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:36.700
have everything here, very nice, this thing,
that. So, how are you a saint?” I said “How

00:25:38.119 --> 00:25:45.119
are you a saint?” [He said] “I have given
up my family, I have given up my cars, I have

00:25:46.309 --> 00:25:53.309
given up my house, I have given up my children.”
I said “One more thing you have given up”,

00:25:55.970 --> 00:26:02.970
he said “What?” I said “Your brains!!”
(laughter and applause) So he said, “How

00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:13.519
do you say we have given up our brains?”
I said, “Very simple, I’ve given up nothing,

00:26:13.519 --> 00:26:19.899
because I am holding nothing! What is there
to give up when you are not holding anything?

00:26:19.899 --> 00:26:26.899
Now, I would say in this house, or on my body,
anywhere, [if] you think you can find anything

00:26:28.119 --> 00:26:35.119
equal to the dust particle of Shri Krishna,
you can take it. Should be equal though.”

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:45.960
Now they started looking here and there. I
said “Then what have you given up? Just

00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:52.509
stones? What have you given? Why are you boasting
about giving up that, and giving up this and

00:26:52.509 --> 00:26:58.279
giving up…?” They even shaved their head.

00:26:58.279 --> 00:27:04.850
All these useless ideas, that “We have done
this, we have done that.” Anybody in Sahaja

00:27:04.850 --> 00:27:11.850
Yoga who thinks he is doing a lot of work
for Sahaja Yoga, should give up completely!

00:27:11.850 --> 00:27:18.850
That’s the sign of another ignorance. If
you are part and parcel of the Ocean, everything

00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:27.720
is done by Ocean, you are doing nothing. To
have such ideas about yourself shows how little

00:27:29.139 --> 00:27:36.139
you know about your Self. You are the Ocean.
And if you are the Ocean how can you claim

00:27:36.659 --> 00:27:41.929
“I’ve touched this shore, I have touched
that shore, I have touched this shore“?

00:27:41.929 --> 00:27:48.929
No more “I” is left. Once this I-ness
drops out then only the Universal Being within

00:27:50.090 --> 00:27:54.679
you shines.

00:27:54.679 --> 00:28:01.679
All these things are so clearly evident in
our characters. Some people are very identified,

00:28:08.590 --> 00:28:15.590
say with their country, or maybe with their
worshipping style, whatever it is. All these

00:28:18.639 --> 00:28:25.029
mis-identifications have to be given up. It
is very difficult for people because they

00:28:25.029 --> 00:28:32.029
are so conditioned, and as long as you have
conditioning you cannot rise above your mind,

00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:39.480
which is a myth, you cannot. Now, try to understand,
what your conditionings are.

00:28:46.379 --> 00:28:52.619
One of them, I would say, I have seen and
I am so surprised, you go to the Western countries,

00:28:52.619 --> 00:28:59.619
all of them only sing songs of Shri Ganesha.
They know all the songs of Shri Ganesha. Shri

00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:06.399
Ganesha’s photographs, Shri Ganesha’s
everything, children also. And now I have

00:29:06.399 --> 00:29:12.799
seen that vibrations stop! Why should they
stop? Why should Ganesha stop the vibrations?

00:29:12.799 --> 00:29:19.149
Why they are doing it, I realised, was because
I said Shri Ganesha incarnated as Christ.

00:29:19.149 --> 00:29:26.149
Their identification is with Christ and Christianity,
in a very subtle way. So all the vibrations

00:29:29.639 --> 00:29:36.639
stopped! Imagine with Shri Ganesha’s music,
we heard in one of the Eastern Block countries,

00:29:38.759 --> 00:29:44.369
and all the vibrations had stopped and they
were singing all the songs of Shri Ganesha

00:29:44.369 --> 00:29:51.369
and not one song of Sahaja Yoga, leave alone
about the Guru, not once. So, even there is

00:29:56.210 --> 00:30:01.960
a very subtle identification.

00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:08.960
There was one fellow in Russia, supposed to
be very intelligent, he said that “Alright,

00:30:12.139 --> 00:30:18.629
if we keep Mother’s photograph and also
the icons, we can get the same type of vibrations.”

00:30:18.629 --> 00:30:25.629
You cannot, because icons are made by some
artist’s imaginary. These are not representing

00:30:28.009 --> 00:30:35.009
actually even Maria or Christ or anyone, they
are all imaginary. If Italian ones make Christ,

00:30:37.179 --> 00:30:44.179
he is Italian style, if some French one makes
it, he is thin like French, if you get somebody

00:30:49.809 --> 00:30:56.809
say from Holland, he will have a forehead
like that. You see all of them they depict

00:30:58.489 --> 00:31:05.489
Christ as they want to. Then we have Maria
the same way, Her expression, her photograph,

00:31:07.450 --> 00:31:14.450
everything, is all according to the imagination
of the artist and to whatever country he belongs,

00:31:17.039 --> 00:31:18.869
that he will do.

00:31:18.869 --> 00:31:24.859
And they are not free, you can see they are
not free, because all these artists have a

00:31:24.859 --> 00:31:31.489
certain style. Now if it is Rembrandt, it’s
a style, if it is, say Leonardo, it’s a

00:31:31.489 --> 00:31:38.489
style. Though they are born realised, still
they have a style. Nobody is like this, that

00:31:39.129 --> 00:31:46.129
he’ll make today like this, tomorrow like
that: there’s no freedom. They are bound

00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:54.059
by their own styles. Everybody has one style,
and that is the style they follow. Because,

00:31:54.059 --> 00:32:01.059
what is the reason, the reason is, they must
have done 3 or 4 types of styles, they must

00:32:02.629 --> 00:32:09.629
have done, surely, but people must have rejected,
“This is no good, this is no good,” so

00:32:10.970 --> 00:32:16.200
it is all the opinion of the people. So they
must have taken to one style: alright this

00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:17.789
is the style.

00:32:17.789 --> 00:32:24.789
So you can see Christ if he’s Japanese,
he’ll have chinky eyes, if he’s Chinese,

00:32:26.269 --> 00:32:33.269
he’ll have no nose, if it’s Indian, he’ll
be dark. So all kinds of Christs I have seen

00:32:38.809 --> 00:32:45.809
and I feel that, how can they emit vibrations?
Tell me. While with my photograph, how can

00:32:47.580 --> 00:32:53.859
you compare? Also, cameras were to be developed
at this time: do you notice that point? Cameras

00:32:53.859 --> 00:33:00.859
were developed at this time, not before that.
This loudspeaker was not developed before

00:33:02.379 --> 00:33:08.609
this. Aeroplanes were not developed before.
I have been travelling for 19 days, one day

00:33:08.609 --> 00:33:15.609
in the plane, second day in the public programme.
They could not do all that. Nobody could do

00:33:19.710 --> 00:33:26.710
this. Neither Shri Krishna, nor anyone. They
could not fly by aeroplane in those days.

00:33:28.609 --> 00:33:34.029
Now we say we have 65 countries, somebody
says there’s “No, 68 countries” or go

00:33:34.029 --> 00:33:41.029
on correcting. But is only possible because
today, today: there are aeroplanes. They were

00:33:41.450 --> 00:33:43.580
never there [before].

00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:50.580
So all these things are – even video, even
the way you are seeing My image there, was

00:33:51.710 --> 00:33:58.710
that available before? No. So this is a very
special time, where science has also supported

00:34:03.529 --> 00:34:09.840
seekers to find the Truth – science has
supported. We have to be thankful to science:

00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:16.289
that part of science which has been so much
supportive. Even [if] there was not a car,

00:34:16.289 --> 00:34:23.289
I could not have gone up to Milan even! Imagine
going on a bullock cart, what would have happened

00:34:24.010 --> 00:34:31.010
to Me? So all these things are created today
for you. You were also born in those times

00:34:36.530 --> 00:34:43.520
for the special reason. They could not give
realisation because that time you were not

00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:50.520
there. Very few people of your calibre were
there. But I wonder if you understand your

00:34:51.559 --> 00:34:52.230
calibre.

00:34:52.230 --> 00:34:59.230
The way you are sometimes growing, shows that
you don’t understand your calibre. You don’t

00:35:03.329 --> 00:35:10.329
know what you are, how much the whole atmosphere
has worked out for you, the science has been

00:35:12.299 --> 00:35:19.299
worked out for you. Science is a gift of the
nature. All this has been worked out for you

00:35:21.569 --> 00:35:28.569
to achieve the highest state in the shortest
time. But for that, one has to be extremely

00:35:33.569 --> 00:35:40.569
introspecting. Instead of thinking of what
you have to achieve: be introspective! This

00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:50.380
introspection will help you and you will really
become real gurus. When you go to other villages,

00:35:55.589 --> 00:36:02.589
other places, other cities, people should
know from your being itself that some great

00:36:03.089 --> 00:36:10.089
person has come. You don’t have to tell,
you don’t have to certify, it’s the simplicity

00:36:13.339 --> 00:36:17.700
of your temperament itself.

00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:24.700
First time I went to Leningrad, nobody knew
about Me. No advertisements, nothing, They

00:36:26.210 --> 00:36:33.210
just put some posters, some. And there were
2,000 people in the hall, 2,000 outside. In

00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:42.200
the hall they had to pay, alright. I was wondering
what’s the matter. And when I came out I

00:36:42.430 --> 00:36:48.750
gave them realisation but I said “You come
tomorrow“. So 2,000 from inside and 2,000

00:36:48.750 --> 00:36:55.750
from outside and about 2,000 more came, and
we were all sitting on the ground. I was amazed.

00:36:57.180 --> 00:37:04.180
I said “What made you come to my programme?”
[They] said “Mother, it’s so obvious,

00:37:05.950 --> 00:37:12.950
your photograph!” Such sensitivity of spirituality:
“So obvious, from your photograph!” And

00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:21.780
they were scientists, they were doctors, they
were all kinds of intelligent people. But

00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:28.780
they could feel the spirituality from the
face. That kind of a sensitivity we should

00:37:31.250 --> 00:37:37.000
have. When you don’t need any discretion,
nothing, you know: this is this, this is this,

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:44.000
this is this. Don’t have to judge, don’t
have to think about it. You cannot say who

00:37:48.319 --> 00:37:55.319
will be best fitted for this: those who have
come for the first time, those who have come

00:37:57.930 --> 00:38:04.930
later on or those who will be coming, younger
or older, women, men or children. It is there.

00:38:09.140 --> 00:38:15.809
In my lifetime if I see so many of you, so
much transformed, looking so beautiful, so

00:38:15.809 --> 00:38:22.809
nice, creating such a good atmosphere. It’s
more than satisfaction for Me. And sometimes

00:38:24.270 --> 00:38:30.819
I think there is nothing to be done now anymore
– finished. But then they invite Me here,

00:38:30.819 --> 00:38:36.640
and invite Me there, so I’m just doing.
But to be very frank I am over satisfied.

00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:43.640
Now, once you have planted the tree…it’s
like a mango tree. Once you have planted a

00:38:44.490 --> 00:38:51.109
mango tree and looked after it for 3 or 4
years, then it looks after itself. It gives

00:38:51.109 --> 00:38:58.109
fruits, it doesn’t need any water, nothing,
it just grows by itself. In the same way it

00:38:58.849 --> 00:39:05.849
should happen with you. You should grow by
yourself. Of course, you will find people

00:39:06.970 --> 00:39:13.970
who are stupid, who are aggressive, who are
not at all Sahaja Yogis and trying to be Sahaja

00:39:16.770 --> 00:39:23.770
Yogis. You’ll find all kinds. So just see
them, that’s all.

00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:32.480
In this Guru puja, you have to decide that
what are the criteria. First a Guru has to

00:39:38.619 --> 00:39:45.619
be without desires, any desires whatsoever:
nirichcha as they say. There is one false

00:39:52.990 --> 00:39:59.549
guru in India who said that ” If I had the
powers as Mother has, then I would have become

00:39:59.549 --> 00:40:06.549
the king of this world“. So people said
“Then why don’t you become?” Why doesn’t

00:40:07.420 --> 00:40:12.270
Mother become like that? Why doesn’t She
become the king?” So they said “Because

00:40:12.270 --> 00:40:17.400
She is nirichcha- means She has no desires.
A person who has no desires will not become

00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:23.809
anything.” So, I said go and tell him “If
you have desires, you cannot have powers also.”

00:40:23.809 --> 00:40:30.809
It’s only because you have no desires, that’s
why all these powers are there.

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:40.000
So any desire that comes in your mind, you
should say “Forget it, just forget it.”

00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:50.680
When the desire is overpowering, you just
divert your attention. Any kind of stupid

00:40:52.789 --> 00:40:59.789
desire can take charge and how do you become
desireless is by getting to the thoughtless

00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:10.839
awareness. Any crisis comes in, you should
be able to rise into that state of thoughtless

00:41:10.839 --> 00:41:17.279
awareness. Just be peaceful. Look at your
desires with peace. You can tell the desire,

00:41:17.279 --> 00:41:24.279
“Oh, I’m very much satisfied, now don’t
come, I don’t want.” That’s how you

00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:34.700
can become desireless. There is this compassion,
and the compassion that becomes actually the

00:41:41.369 --> 00:41:48.369
power. [With] small, small things you can
express your love, very small, small things.

00:41:51.359 --> 00:41:58.359
In very sweet ways, you can express your love..
Is very important.

00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:07.160
The whole world needs today love and peace.
And you have to give peace and love to everyone

00:42:08.740 --> 00:42:15.270
that is possible. Of course [with] Sahaja
Yogis it is very easy, but even non Sahaja

00:42:15.270 --> 00:42:22.270
Yogis, you must treat them with respect and
love, but you should not have a desire that

00:42:24.049 --> 00:42:30.890
you should get back anything from them.
It’s alright, whatever done, is forgotten.

00:42:30.890 --> 00:42:35.710
You have known so many Sahaja Yogis who came
to Sahaja Yoga have gained so much and have

00:42:35.710 --> 00:42:42.710
betrayed us – it doesn’t matter, it’s
not important. Because they are going to be

00:42:42.910 --> 00:42:49.910
losers, not we. So, there’s nothing to bother
about these things.

00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:59.160
Then another thing is: try to see that your
mind doesn’t react. Some people have a habit,

00:42:59.710 --> 00:43:05.940
or I think most of them have, to react. You
tell them something and they’ll put their

00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:12.940
own one tail with it, something. Never will
they accept if somebody says something. If

00:43:16.539 --> 00:43:23.539
you are reacting, what will go into your heads?
What will go into your heart? What will go

00:43:23.599 --> 00:43:30.599
into your attention?
So the reaction itself is a sign of not proper

00:43:31.190 --> 00:43:37.770
development within yourself. This attention
which is trying to go into all the areas of

00:43:37.770 --> 00:43:44.770
your mind and your body and everywhere, is
not there. It cannot enter, because as soon

00:43:46.579 --> 00:43:53.579
as it tries to enter, you shut it by reacting.
You cannot see anything just for seeing sake,

00:43:56.220 --> 00:44:02.559
you must react. You say “This is not good,
that’s not good.” If I say “It is 5

00:44:02.559 --> 00:44:09.559
o’clock” you’ll say “No! It is 5 past,
2 minutes, 3 seconds!” This comes with terrible

00:44:13.950 --> 00:44:20.950
conditioning which has to go away. Not to
react. Why should you react? Then the argument

00:44:23.779 --> 00:44:30.779
starts, then fight starts, then wars come
in. If you tell your mind, “Nothing doing,

00:44:32.450 --> 00:44:39.450
you are a myth and I am not going to react
to anything!” 99. 9% problems will be solved.

00:44:48.490 --> 00:44:55.490
Then the last, but not the least is the ego.
I can’t understand a saint having a ego,

00:44:59.359 --> 00:45:06.359
just can’t understand. It’s so stupid
to have ego. It’s a kind of a domination,

00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:19.520
if slightest things are wrong, you get angry.
If somebody says something, you get angry.

00:45:21.950 --> 00:45:28.950
That means your power of love and compassion
is still not full. You can of course correct

00:45:34.059 --> 00:45:40.289
people when they have to be corrected but
for that you should have this power within

00:45:40.289 --> 00:45:46.690
yourself. The person should know that you
are correcting that person because you love

00:45:46.690 --> 00:45:53.690
that person, not for selfishness, not for
any gain. But this ego is a very big problem

00:45:55.380 --> 00:46:02.380
and that comes up by, I should say, not only
ignorance but stupid ideas about yourself.

00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:16.400
If you think you are something great, already,
then what can you do? Ego makes you very arrogant,

00:46:21.349 --> 00:46:28.349
horrible. But if you are humble, really, not
to just to have the humility of a businessman,

00:46:29.020 --> 00:46:36.020
but if you are humble from within yourself,
from your heart, enjoying your humility, then

00:46:42.020 --> 00:46:44.049
this ego can run away.

00:46:44.049 --> 00:46:49.609
You have to ask yourself “Now what are you
angry for?” Again, I come back to the same

00:46:49.609 --> 00:46:56.609
point: introspection. Because you are not
here just to carry on some jobs, but you are

00:46:57.339 --> 00:47:04.339
here to become saints. Then this ego should
be made into a great instrument of love and

00:47:11.250 --> 00:47:18.250
joy. You can, it is not difficult. This one
is what is ego is, reactions to things. You

00:47:24.579 --> 00:47:29.089
can react to things in a sweet way or you
can react to things in a deadly way. Then

00:47:29.089 --> 00:47:36.089
the humour comes in. Also you speak as if
there is fragrant flowers which are coming

00:47:46.690 --> 00:47:53.690
out. Then every action of yours, everything
becomes very gentle and sweet. Have this ego

00:47:57.990 --> 00:48:04.990
that will be gentle, will be kind, will be
sweet, will be forgiving, will be loving.

00:48:05.260 --> 00:48:12.089
Let’s have this ego. Start with this kind
of a ego – the other way round. You’ll

00:48:12.089 --> 00:48:18.289
be surprised how you can really conquer the
whole world.

00:48:18.289 --> 00:48:25.289
On this day of Guru Puja, is, Guru is supposed
to tell something to his disciples about correcting

00:48:26.910 --> 00:48:33.369
themselves. In my own sweet way I’ve said
to you which you shouldn’t mind. I don’t

00:48:33.369 --> 00:48:40.369
mean to condemn you by any chance but to give
you a proper sense of introspection, proper

00:48:40.839 --> 00:48:47.839
sense of introspection by which you all get
your gurupada. My only, I shouldn’t say

00:48:52.490 --> 00:48:59.490
desire, because I don’t have desire. So
my only vision is, that I should see all the

00:49:00.099 --> 00:49:07.099
Sahaja Yogis drenched in the power of love,
enjoying each others love, enjoying each others

00:49:11.539 --> 00:49:18.539
relationship, and improving relationships.
I know there are problematic people, I know

00:49:18.670 --> 00:49:24.099
they are problematic, but if you cannot solve
the problem what’s the use of your become

00:49:24.099 --> 00:49:26.549
masters?

00:49:26.549 --> 00:49:33.549
So, I leave it to you to solve your own problems
which you are facing, and introspection with

00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:49.789
love and compassion, not by condemning yourself.
I am sure you can manage it.

00:49:49.789 --> 00:49:51.420
May God bless you.
