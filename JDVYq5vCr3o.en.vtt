00:00:11.107 --> 00:00:14.726
All these years

00:00:19.136 --> 00:00:24.645
I have been waiting for this day.

00:00:30.387 --> 00:00:37.926
We have now, on the twenty-first
Sahasrara,

00:00:40.869 --> 00:00:49.559
so is a very important turning point

00:00:49.760 --> 00:01:03.478
as you know that every twenty-first day
we change our calendars

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:07.968
as far as the horoscope is concerned.

00:01:11.663 --> 00:01:17.089
And so now is a new change has to come

00:01:18.453 --> 00:01:22.427
and you can see the announcement.

00:01:29.046 --> 00:01:40.795
A new understanding and awareness
of a very new dimension.

00:01:42.273 --> 00:01:50.210
We have been so far dealing with collective
consciousness.

00:01:52.014 --> 00:01:55.359
We are collectively conscious.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:07.180
We have the idea that we are collectively
conscious.

00:02:08.866 --> 00:02:15.714
Also we know we are part and parcel
of the whole

00:02:18.662 --> 00:02:24.484
and that we all are sahaja yogis.

00:02:24.685 --> 00:02:35.522
We know about our chakras and our nadis
very clearly,

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:41.886
but perhaps we do not know about our
powers,

00:02:42.751 --> 00:02:48.655
how many powers have developed in those
twenty-one years within yourself.

00:03:01.119 --> 00:03:07.412
Last two months Italy was burning with
fire, it was so very hot.

00:03:07.613 --> 00:03:11.420
And I read reports that they are worried
about a drought

00:03:11.697 --> 00:03:17.893
and they want rain to come in and now
they think the time has passed away.

00:03:21.817 --> 00:03:31.774
But how it works, you see, because the
All-pervading Power knows everything

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:38.404
and the whole nature works for your
benefit, for your programmes.

00:03:38.605 --> 00:03:42.410
At the right time things happen, as you
have seen before.

00:03:42.611 --> 00:03:48.539
They are completely coordinated with
our programmes.

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:50.931
All the time they are helping you.

00:03:51.132 --> 00:03:55.000
Whatever they have in themselves as powers,

00:03:55.201 --> 00:03:59.291
they are using them at the right time.

00:03:59.492 --> 00:04:08.094
Now be confident that you have powers.

00:04:08.295 --> 00:04:20.106
And this is the new change that is going
to come within your own understanding.

00:04:20.307 --> 00:04:25.034
So far only you knew that you could feel
the vibrations,

00:04:25.235 --> 00:04:30.929
that you could cure people, you could
help to cure -

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:40.449
I mean, still not so confident that you
could feel the Paramchaitanya.

00:04:42.523 --> 00:04:48.146
But you did not know what dynamic Forces
are working in you now

00:04:48.347 --> 00:04:52.745
and this is the new change that is going
to come.

00:04:52.946 --> 00:04:57.639
With this new change, you have to assume
a new character,

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.312
and the new character is announcement.

00:05:01.526 --> 00:05:08.812
So far I had told you not to talk about
Sahaja Yoga very openly, blatantly,

00:05:09.132 --> 00:05:14.779
but now the time has come. We waited
long for these days.

00:05:14.994 --> 00:05:18.298
Now you have to all start talking about it,

00:05:18.499 --> 00:05:22.063
announcing about it and telling about it
to everyone.

00:05:22.264 --> 00:05:28.182
Otherwise, the world would say that,
“We never knew about it!”

00:05:28.786 --> 00:05:35.886
All other false gurus are so well known
all over because their disciples

00:05:36.077 --> 00:05:39.912
are talking about them [in] all the places,
wherever they can.

00:05:40.113 --> 00:05:45.118
To all the big offices they go, to big
people they go.

00:05:45.319 --> 00:05:50.414
They go to all the important people. [They]
just go and tell them what they have.

00:05:50.605 --> 00:05:54.370
So far we had kept Sahaja Yoga at a low ebb

00:05:54.591 --> 00:05:58.500
because I wanted you, first of all,
to develop

00:05:58.701 --> 00:06:05.212
into really very beautiful sahaja yogis,
so that from your life,

00:06:05.413 --> 00:06:11.628
from your lifestyle, from your behaviour,
from your understanding,

00:06:11.829 --> 00:06:18.489
from your thoughts, people will realise
that these people are very unique

00:06:19.786 --> 00:06:23.983
and very different type of people.

00:06:24.785 --> 00:06:31.252
Now that assumption has to be there.

00:06:31.746 --> 00:06:38.901
You have to understand that all these
powers are bubbling in you

00:06:39.082 --> 00:06:44.536
and just out of formality or maybe out
of shyness

00:06:44.737 --> 00:06:50.750
or maybe little cowardice, you are hiding
them.

00:06:50.951 --> 00:06:54.342
The other day there was a sahaja yogi
who came to my house

00:06:54.542 --> 00:07:01.673
and he saw some flowers which were
fading away.

00:07:01.875 --> 00:07:06.147
I said, “They are not fading. You can give
them life.” He said, “How?”

00:07:06.348 --> 00:07:12.910
I said, “You cut the bottom of all of them
and put your hand underneath.”

00:07:13.101 --> 00:07:18.177
[Aside to someone: Take these children
away. Just what book he has got?]

00:07:22.269 --> 00:07:32.698
And he just put his hands under the base
of the stem

00:07:32.899 --> 00:07:34.993
and he said, “Mother, they are still
drooping.” I said, “All right,

00:07:35.194 --> 00:07:38.091
now leave them in the water.”

00:07:38.292 --> 00:07:39.487
His attention was here and there,

00:07:39.688 --> 00:07:43.670
within fifteen days (minutes?) they all
stood up all right,

00:07:43.871 --> 00:07:47.300
started growing, they became bigger
flowers,

00:07:47.501 --> 00:07:51.891
and lasted for five days more after that.

00:07:52.092 --> 00:07:55.422
Then he was convinced.

00:07:57.363 --> 00:08:05.120
You can do so many things to convince
yourself that you have these powers.

00:08:05.321 --> 00:08:09.514
I have seen people who have certain
problems.

00:08:09.715 --> 00:08:13.368
They have a headache, they have this, that.
They come to me,

00:08:13.569 --> 00:08:18.667
write big letters, “Mother, I get my
headache. I can’t get rid of it.”

00:08:18.868 --> 00:08:23.124
Now those days are gone when Mother has
to cure your headache,

00:08:23.325 --> 00:08:29.100
look after your wife, look after your
children. Is all finished now.

00:08:29.301 --> 00:08:34.279
Now you are responsible, not only
for yourself,

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:41.886
but for your ashrams, for your cities,

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:46.834
for your countries and for the whole world.

00:08:47.342 --> 00:08:50.461
Now, assume your powers.

00:08:50.662 --> 00:08:56.568
Like yesterday he sang, or he played,
‘The Royal Court’ (Nishat Khan).

00:08:56.798 --> 00:09:01.450
So now you are in The Royal Court. Take up
your responsibilities!

00:09:01.651 --> 00:09:08.048
Everybody has to feel responsible.
And assume what you are.

00:09:08.272 --> 00:09:13.409
Know your powers, what you can do.
Sit down.

00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:17.820
Now, the days are gone when you had
to sit down and count your blessings.

00:09:18.021 --> 00:09:20.984
Now you have to count your powers:

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:26.616
“How many powers I have and what I can
use and how I can use.”

00:09:26.847 --> 00:09:30.515
No use counting your miracles. You have
had enough miracles to prove

00:09:30.706 --> 00:09:35.903
that you are sahaja yogis and that you are
helped by the Paramchaitanya.

00:09:36.104 --> 00:09:38.806
But now know how much of that
Paramachaitanya

00:09:39.006 --> 00:09:42.851
you are going to use yourself, how you
are going to manoeuvre it

00:09:43.052 --> 00:09:46.571
and how you are going to work out.

00:09:47.598 --> 00:09:54.356
This is the New Era we are starting
from today.

00:09:54.557 --> 00:09:59.950
And this is the day I was waiting for all
of you to realise

00:10:00.151 --> 00:10:04.238
that you are not sahaja yogis for only
your selfish ends,

00:10:04.439 --> 00:10:09.470
nor for your families, nor for your
communities,

00:10:09.671 --> 00:10:12.701
nor for your country, but for the whole
world.

00:10:12.902 --> 00:10:16.872
Expand yourself. You must have that vision
before you,

00:10:17.073 --> 00:10:20.518
that I have put many a times before
you people,

00:10:20.719 --> 00:10:23.565
that – you have to emancipate the humanity.

00:10:23.766 --> 00:10:26.361
Now don’t have diffidence.

00:10:26.562 --> 00:10:31.236
First of all, you should not think that,
“We are very ordinary people.

00:10:31.437 --> 00:10:35.646
We are very ordinary. We haven’t got
something special about it.”

00:10:35.847 --> 00:10:38.195
This work is not going to be done
by special people

00:10:38.395 --> 00:10:42.146
because they are suffering from ego.

00:10:42.347 --> 00:10:45.911
It is going to be done by people who don’t
have that ego

00:10:46.112 --> 00:10:52.825
of great success or of great achievements
or riches or anything.

00:10:53.026 --> 00:10:57.147
If they are rid of this, then only they can
work it out.

00:10:57.348 --> 00:11:01.753
And that’s why it is for you to understand
what Christ has said

00:11:01.954 --> 00:11:13.312
that a camel can pass through the hole
of a needle, but not a rich man.

00:11:13.513 --> 00:11:17.080
Because the ego is too big, bigger than
a camel, bigger than an elephant,

00:11:17.281 --> 00:11:20.858
any animal you could think of.

00:11:21.059 --> 00:11:25.732
That’s why now as we are entering into
new awareness,

00:11:25.933 --> 00:11:32.875
let us not worry about our negative
thinking.

00:11:34.148 --> 00:11:39.819
So, first is the diffidence: “How can I be?
I am not all right.

00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:45.111
I was like this. I was doing like this.
I had done like this.”

00:11:45.333 --> 00:11:48.064
So many letters of confessions come to me,

00:11:48.265 --> 00:11:52.178
pages after pages, which I throw away
or burn them off.

00:11:52.379 --> 00:11:55.682
There is no need to confess any more.
There’s only one confession,

00:11:55.883 --> 00:11:59.933
that “I am a sahaja yogi and now, after
twenty-first of Sahasrara,

00:12:00.134 --> 00:12:03.295
I am a Maha Yogi.”

00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:07.242
This is the confession you have to make.

00:12:07.443 --> 00:12:11.499
And no more of all these out-of-date things
that people tell me

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:15.458
about your family’s life and all mundane,
nonsensical things.

00:12:15.659 --> 00:12:19.042
We have given them up and we have come
to Sahaja Yoga for our ascent.

00:12:19.243 --> 00:12:24.181
We have achieved our ascent and now
for what? For what?

00:12:24.382 --> 00:12:29.657
Have achieved our ascent is to emancipate
human beings,

00:12:29.858 --> 00:12:36.861
to help them out of the mire of ignorance,
of darkness.

00:12:37.751 --> 00:12:46.803
The main target, I feel today, should not
be so much political as fundamentalism.

00:12:47.004 --> 00:12:50.090
So we have to openly say to these
fundamentalists

00:12:50.291 --> 00:12:52.316
that, “You are nonsensical. You don’t know
the truth.

00:12:52.517 --> 00:12:56.102
You don’t know anything about truth.
You don’t know that you are the Spirit.

00:12:56.303 --> 00:12:58.379
You don’t know that there is a power
that is working.”

00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:02.197
You have to tell them very clearly,
“You are all stupid people

00:13:02.398 --> 00:13:05.263
running after something that is a mirage

00:13:05.464 --> 00:13:09.585
and all of you will end up into hell
as described by all the scriptures.”

00:13:09.786 --> 00:13:12.494
We have to openly say it, this thing.

00:13:12.695 --> 00:13:14.379
Whichever way you like, you may write
books.

00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:17.169
You may publish it. You may tell people
about it.

00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:20.155
But now the new announcement has to come
to say

00:13:20.356 --> 00:13:26.152
that running after falsehood is not going
to take you to God.

00:13:26.803 --> 00:13:31.731
And, in that, they have used the power
of hatred.

00:13:31.932 --> 00:13:34.644
So you have to say that, “We believe
in the power of love

00:13:34.845 --> 00:13:37.889
and not in the power of hatred that you
believe in.”

00:13:38.090 --> 00:13:42.836
For us, everybody is capable of finding
the Truth

00:13:43.037 --> 00:13:52.845
and is capable of getting to the heaven
of that paradise,

00:13:53.046 --> 00:13:56.154
which is promised to us, the Kingdom
of God.

00:13:56.355 --> 00:14:00.856
So, for us, everybody, whether they belong
to this community, that community,

00:14:01.057 --> 00:14:05.368
this race or that race, whatever it is,
we believe –

00:14:05.569 --> 00:14:11.204
not that – but we are sure, that we all
are quite capable

00:14:11.405 --> 00:14:16.361
and blessed by God, that we should enter
into His Kingdom.

00:14:16.562 --> 00:14:22.552
If you take this kind of a positive
attitude, your negativity will go away.

00:14:22.753 --> 00:14:25.644
Negative forces, as you know, you have
been pulled down

00:14:25.845 --> 00:14:31.618
by this kind of a thing or that kind of
a thing, specially after Sahaja Yoga.

00:14:31.819 --> 00:14:34.604
Before Sahaja Yoga, we are not attached
to any families or anything.

00:14:34.805 --> 00:14:39.347
After Sahaja Yoga you just got attached
to your families, like glued to them.

00:14:39.548 --> 00:14:44.304
Absolutely glued. I mean, I had to solve
everybody’s family problems.

00:14:44.505 --> 00:14:47.860
Now we have marriages and even after
marriages I find

00:14:48.061 --> 00:14:50.835
[that] still people don’t understand what
is a Sahaja Yoga marriage.

00:14:51.036 --> 00:14:55.216
And there are still some problems —
very few, but there are.

00:14:55.417 --> 00:15:00.926
So this nonsensical problem of “my family,
my wife, my children,

00:15:01.127 --> 00:15:07.195
my house, my property, my money,” all this
“my” should be finished first of all.

00:15:07.396 --> 00:15:13.033
You have to belong to the world. Any person
who is a king,

00:15:13.234 --> 00:15:17.789
[who] does not belong to his kingdom
is a failure, is useless.

00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:23.945
If he thinks about himself, about his own
comfort, about his own fame,

00:15:24.146 --> 00:15:28.414
about his own achievements, then
he is a failure.

00:15:28.615 --> 00:15:33.716
He has to think about the country on which
he is ruling.

00:15:33.917 --> 00:15:38.216
In the same way, you have to also turn
your mind away

00:15:38.417 --> 00:15:41.636
from all these petty things that you have
been dealing with.

00:15:41.837 --> 00:15:43.855
I have been struggling with you, trying
to help you

00:15:44.056 --> 00:15:46.509
for every small little nonsensical things.

00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:48.727
And many people said that, “Mother,
why should You worry?

00:15:48.928 --> 00:15:50.950
You are a saint. Why should You worry
about these things?”

00:15:51.151 --> 00:15:54.499
I said, “Unless and until these
entanglements are taken away,

00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:56.070
they are not going to come out.”

00:15:56.271 --> 00:16:01.647
But now, now you do feel that freedom,
complete freedom.

00:16:01.848 --> 00:16:04.923
You are an individual. You are absolutely
free

00:16:05.124 --> 00:16:08.009
and the source of your joy is your Spirit.

00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:10.292
You are not entangled with anyone.

00:16:10.493 --> 00:16:13.303
You are not any way attached to anyone.

00:16:13.504 --> 00:16:17.250
In that detachment, you are going
to nourish everyone,

00:16:17.451 --> 00:16:20.674
inclusive of so-called your family, your
people,

00:16:20.875 --> 00:16:23.648
your country and ultimately the world.

00:16:23.879 --> 00:16:31.996
So, to get rid of negativity, first
important thing is to learn detachment.

00:16:32.197 --> 00:16:35.341
Detachment comes through thoughtless
awareness.

00:16:35.542 --> 00:16:38.676
When you look at anyone or start thinking
about anyone –

00:16:38.919 --> 00:16:41.596
get to your state of thoughtless awareness.

00:16:41.797 --> 00:16:47.225
Immediately you’ll feel detached and you’ll
know the solution of the whole problem.

00:16:47.426 --> 00:16:52.748
Now the greatest power you have is in your
brain, that you are knowledgeable.

00:16:52.949 --> 00:16:55.244
Not knowledgeable the way you understand,

00:16:55.445 --> 00:16:58.415
that, “what is the chakra, what is
the centre” — not that.

00:16:58.616 --> 00:17:00.917
But there is all knowledge within you.

00:17:01.118 --> 00:17:05.380
Just you have to get into thoughtless
awareness

00:17:05.581 --> 00:17:08.513
and the whole library of knowledge can
open to you.

00:17:08.699 --> 00:17:12.464
You know, so many of you have never been
speaking on the stage,

00:17:12.665 --> 00:17:16.835
they had stage fear, and you have become
great speakers.

00:17:17.036 --> 00:17:21.309
So many of you were possessed people
who couldn’t even stand before me,

00:17:21.523 --> 00:17:26.374
have now become leaders and are doing
good job.

00:17:26.575 --> 00:17:30.628
In every field you will find that you have
advanced so much.

00:17:30.809 --> 00:17:34.189
So many people who never knew how
to sing have started singing,

00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:36.646
did not know how to paint have started
painting.

00:17:36.847 --> 00:17:40.648
But these are very, very mundane things

00:17:40.849 --> 00:17:44.099
which may give us little pleasures here
and there,

00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:48.806
but the main thing is how many people
we give Realisation to.

00:17:49.007 --> 00:17:51.272
Whether you are a woman, whether you
are man,

00:17:51.473 --> 00:17:53.828
whether you are a father, whether you are
a mother,

00:17:54.029 --> 00:17:57.300
whether you are a child or a grown up.

00:17:57.501 --> 00:18:01.515
Everybody has to see how many people
we can give Realisation to,

00:18:01.716 --> 00:18:06.428
how much we can announce about Sahaja
Yoga. That’s the main thing.

00:18:06.629 --> 00:18:09.507
Sahaja Yoga is not by the way. And it
happens.

00:18:09.708 --> 00:18:12.423
Like, when I went to Australia, I was
surprised

00:18:12.624 --> 00:18:16.082
that Sahaja Yoga, which was such a prime
thing for them,

00:18:16.283 --> 00:18:21.010
suddenly became by the way. So Sahaja
Yoga is a commitment,

00:18:21.211 --> 00:18:24.351
is a commitment and complete involvement.

00:18:24.552 --> 00:18:28.030
Otherwise you are really useless for Sahaja
Yoga, absolutely useless.

00:18:28.231 --> 00:18:30.912
It’s better to have few people who are
committed

00:18:31.113 --> 00:18:34.418
than to have thousands who are just
useless.

00:18:34.619 --> 00:18:38.388
So let us see what you have decided
for yourself

00:18:38.589 --> 00:18:41.497
and what you have decided for Sahaja Yoga.

00:18:41.698 --> 00:18:43.991
If you have decided to opt for Sahaja Yoga,

00:18:44.192 --> 00:18:48.291
then just know that this is the main thing
which you have to do.

00:18:48.495 --> 00:18:51.650
The whole attention should be on that.

00:18:51.851 --> 00:18:56.475
As I told this morning, a very good poem
written by Namadeva

00:18:56.676 --> 00:19:01.479
and was included in the Guru Granth Sahib,

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:05.323
that, “A boy is playing with his kite and
the kite is flying in the air.

00:19:05.524 --> 00:19:10.394
He’s talking to everyone, but his attention
is on the kite.

00:19:10.595 --> 00:19:13.700
There’s a lady who is doing all
the household work.

00:19:13.901 --> 00:19:17.560
She is doing all the cleaning, but
the child is on her,

00:19:17.761 --> 00:19:23.169
on her back or on her waist. All her
attention is on the child.

00:19:23.370 --> 00:19:26.165
Then there are ladies who are taking
water home.

00:19:26.366 --> 00:19:31.099
There’s a water pitcher on their heads,
sometimes two, sometimes three.

00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:34.749
They’re carrying, balancing it. They’re
talking to each other, laughing,

00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:36.946
but the whole attention is on the balance.”

00:19:37.147 --> 00:19:41.652
In the same way, your attention should be
all the time on Sahaja Yoga –

00:19:41.853 --> 00:19:45.137
“What’s happening in Sahaja Yoga?
Where are we? Where are we going?

00:19:45.338 --> 00:19:49.952
Where is Mother? What part She is?
What is She doing?”

00:19:51.647 --> 00:19:58.946
That is, now, if you put your attention to,
your negativity will absolutely disappear

00:19:59.147 --> 00:20:03.094
because attention which was involved
into negative things

00:20:03.295 --> 00:20:08.591
will get absolutely detached and you’ll
start thinking about Sahaja Yoga.

00:20:08.792 --> 00:20:13.016
So now, as you are Maha Yogis, we have
to make it a Mahayoga.

00:20:13.217 --> 00:20:16.187
And unless and until that level is achieved
by you,

00:20:16.388 --> 00:20:18.767
then we should think that you are still
backdated

00:20:18.968 --> 00:20:25.905
and I don’t know, in the turning of the
wheel, how many will be left there.

00:20:26.106 --> 00:20:30.478
So this is a very big turning point and
today is a very great day for us

00:20:30.679 --> 00:20:37.501
because Sahasrara, today, has completed
its twenty-one years

00:20:37.702 --> 00:20:42.447
and, like that, it has twenty-one aspects.

00:20:42.648 --> 00:20:47.783
Seven, the chakras. Seven into three
of your nadis.

00:20:47.984 --> 00:20:55.514
So it’s twenty-one aspects you have been
able to achieve and the twenty-one powers.

00:20:55.715 --> 00:20:58.281
You just experiment and see for yourself.

00:20:58.482 --> 00:21:01.133
Don’t doubt yourself! Just experiment.

00:21:01.334 --> 00:21:04.192
First, you used to even doubt if there is
cool breeze or not,

00:21:04.393 --> 00:21:07.799
used to think it’s an air conditioner
working in London!

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.994
Even [in] London, they used to think there
must be an air conditioner in their head!

00:21:13.195 --> 00:21:15.279
Now those days are gone!

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:20.278
Now don’t doubt yourself and just go
full ahead

00:21:20.479 --> 00:21:25.977
with all the maryadas of Sahaja Yoga.
So the maryada has to be there.

00:21:26.178 --> 00:21:37.503
Except that the moral maryadas and also
of behavioural maryadas,

00:21:37.704 --> 00:21:40.514
there are not many maryadas in Sahaja Yoga.

00:21:40.715 --> 00:21:43.827
You can do what you like. You can live
the way you like.

00:21:44.028 --> 00:21:46.371
You can eat the way you want to eat.

00:21:46.572 --> 00:21:51.599
But the main maryada is that you have to be
very moral people, honest, moral people.

00:21:51.800 --> 00:22:00.670
And, also, you have to be, in a way,
in appearance, in behaviour,

00:22:00.871 --> 00:22:04.530
such a person that you do not become
obnoxious,

00:22:04.731 --> 00:22:09.467
or people don’t think you are queer,
strange people.

00:22:09.668 --> 00:22:12.945
To overcome that, we have to dress up
in a way

00:22:13.146 --> 00:22:17.641
that is rather more appealing to
the general public

00:22:17.842 --> 00:22:24.083
and people see us as normal human being
and as not abnormal human beings.

00:22:24.284 --> 00:22:27.713
There’s not much to be done outside.
It is the inside

00:22:27.914 --> 00:22:31.861
where we’ll have to prepare ourselves
fully, to accept ourselves,

00:22:32.062 --> 00:22:36.342
to tell ourselves every day that we are
now Maha Yogis

00:22:36.543 --> 00:22:38.793
and we have to work it out that way.

00:22:38.994 --> 00:22:41.777
Today we have here people from all over
the world

00:22:41.978 --> 00:22:45.098
and you go and tell this message to all
the rest of the people,

00:22:45.299 --> 00:22:49.236
whom I have not met, that “Mother has
already announced,

00:22:49.437 --> 00:22:54.517
through the Vishnumaya also, that you all
have become now Maha Yogis.”

00:22:54.718 --> 00:23:02.219
And try to express that, manifest that
with full confidence in yourself

00:23:02.449 --> 00:23:06.459
and with this power of love, I am sure
you will all win over.

00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:09.638
May God bless you all.

00:23:22.277 --> 00:23:24.996
There has been nothing written about
Sahasrara before.

00:23:25.197 --> 00:23:27.642
In none of the scriptures Sahasrara is
described.

00:23:27.843 --> 00:23:30.260
Nobody knew anything about Sahasrara.

00:23:30.461 --> 00:23:33.766
They just left it as the seventh chakra —
finished.

00:23:33.967 --> 00:23:39.057
They could only go up to Agnya and nothing
has been written about Sahasrara so far.

00:23:39.258 --> 00:23:43.436
And there is no mantras written about
Sahasrara,

00:23:43.637 --> 00:23:47.897
so we have to now write Sahasrara mantra.

00:23:48.098 --> 00:23:53.681
It is very surprising that even
the photographs of Sahasraras

00:23:53.881 --> 00:23:59.081
have appeared now for you to see that
your Sahasraras are opening.

00:23:59.282 --> 00:24:06.609
And that is something [that] never happened
before in the whole spiritual history

00:24:07.639 --> 00:24:13.126
and nobody could write about it because
they never saw this Sahasrara.

00:24:13.334 --> 00:24:19.615
Now, for you, it is important to see that
you have something so unique with you.

00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:24.436
But only thing what you need is a courage

00:24:24.637 --> 00:24:30.558
and a complete commitment to go forward

00:24:30.759 --> 00:24:37.994
with this propagation of Sahaja Yoga,
announcement of Sahaja Yoga.
