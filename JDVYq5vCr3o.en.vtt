WEBVTT

00:11.107 --> 00:14.726
All these years

00:19.136 --> 00:24.645
I have been waiting for this day.

00:30.387 --> 00:37.926
We have now, on the twenty-first
Sahasrara,

00:40.869 --> 00:49.559
so is a very important turning point

00:49.760 --> 01:03.478
as you know that every twenty-first day
we change our calendars

01:03.790 --> 01:07.968
as far as the horoscope is concerned.

01:11.663 --> 01:17.089
And so now is a new change has to come

01:18.453 --> 01:22.427
and you can see the announcement.

01:29.046 --> 01:40.795
A new understanding and awareness
of a very new dimension.

01:42.273 --> 01:50.210
We have been so far dealing with collective
consciousness.

01:52.014 --> 01:55.359
We are collectively conscious.

01:55.560 --> 02:07.180
We have the idea that we are collectively
conscious.

02:08.866 --> 02:15.714
Also we know we are part and parcel
of the whole

02:18.662 --> 02:24.484
and that we all are sahaja yogis.

02:24.685 --> 02:35.522
We know about our chakras and our nadis
very clearly,

02:36.699 --> 02:41.886
but perhaps we do not know about our
powers,

02:42.751 --> 02:48.655
how many powers have developed in those
twenty-one years within yourself.

03:01.119 --> 03:07.412
Last two months Italy was burning with
fire, it was so very hot.

03:07.613 --> 03:11.420
And I read reports that they are worried
about a drought

03:11.697 --> 03:17.893
and they want rain to come in and now
they think the time has passed away.

03:21.817 --> 03:31.774
But how it works, you see, because the
All-pervading Power knows everything

03:31.980 --> 03:38.404
and the whole nature works for your
benefit, for your programmes.

03:38.605 --> 03:42.410
At the right time things happen, as you
have seen before.

03:42.611 --> 03:48.539
They are completely coordinated with
our programmes.

03:48.740 --> 03:50.931
All the time they are helping you.

03:51.132 --> 03:55.000
Whatever they have in themselves as powers,

03:55.201 --> 03:59.291
they are using them at the right time.

03:59.492 --> 04:08.094
Now be confident that you have powers.

04:08.295 --> 04:20.106
And this is the new change that is going
to come within your own understanding.

04:20.307 --> 04:25.034
So far only you knew that you could feel
the vibrations,

04:25.235 --> 04:30.929
that you could cure people, you could
help to cure -

04:31.130 --> 04:40.449
I mean, still not so confident that you
could feel the Paramchaitanya.

04:42.523 --> 04:48.146
But you did not know what dynamic Forces
are working in you now

04:48.347 --> 04:52.745
and this is the new change that is going
to come.

04:52.946 --> 04:57.639
With this new change, you have to assume
a new character,

04:57.840 --> 05:01.312
and the new character is announcement.

05:01.526 --> 05:08.812
So far I had told you not to talk about
Sahaja Yoga very openly, blatantly,

05:09.132 --> 05:14.779
but now the time has come. We waited
long for these days.

05:14.994 --> 05:18.298
Now you have to all start talking about it,

05:18.499 --> 05:22.063
announcing about it and telling about it
to everyone.

05:22.264 --> 05:28.182
Otherwise, the world would say that,
“We never knew about it!”

05:28.786 --> 05:35.886
All other false gurus are so well known
all over because their disciples

05:36.077 --> 05:39.912
are talking about them [in] all the places,
wherever they can.

05:40.113 --> 05:45.118
To all the big offices they go, to big
people they go.

05:45.319 --> 05:50.414
They go to all the important people. [They]
just go and tell them what they have.

05:50.605 --> 05:54.370
So far we had kept Sahaja Yoga at a low ebb

05:54.591 --> 05:58.500
because I wanted you, first of all,
to develop

05:58.701 --> 06:05.212
into really very beautiful sahaja yogis,
so that from your life,

06:05.413 --> 06:11.628
from your lifestyle, from your behaviour,
from your understanding,

06:11.829 --> 06:18.489
from your thoughts, people will realise
that these people are very unique

06:19.786 --> 06:23.983
and very different type of people.

06:24.785 --> 06:31.252
Now that assumption has to be there.

06:31.746 --> 06:38.901
You have to understand that all these
powers are bubbling in you

06:39.082 --> 06:44.536
and just out of formality or maybe out
of shyness

06:44.737 --> 06:50.750
or maybe little cowardice, you are hiding
them.

06:50.951 --> 06:54.342
The other day there was a sahaja yogi
who came to my house

06:54.542 --> 07:01.673
and he saw some flowers which were
fading away.

07:01.875 --> 07:06.147
I said, “They are not fading. You can give
them life.” He said, “How?”

07:06.348 --> 07:12.910
I said, “You cut the bottom of all of them
and put your hand underneath.”

07:13.101 --> 07:18.177
[Aside to someone: Take these children
away. Just what book he has got?]

07:22.269 --> 07:32.698
And he just put his hands under the base
of the stem

07:32.899 --> 07:34.993
and he said, “Mother, they are still
drooping.” I said, “All right,

07:35.194 --> 07:38.091
now leave them in the water.”

07:38.292 --> 07:39.487
His attention was here and there,

07:39.688 --> 07:43.670
within fifteen days (minutes?) they all
stood up all right,

07:43.871 --> 07:47.300
started growing, they became bigger
flowers,

07:47.501 --> 07:51.891
and lasted for five days more after that.

07:52.092 --> 07:55.422
Then he was convinced.

07:57.363 --> 08:05.120
You can do so many things to convince
yourself that you have these powers.

08:05.321 --> 08:09.514
I have seen people who have certain
problems.

08:09.715 --> 08:13.368
They have a headache, they have this, that.
They come to me,

08:13.569 --> 08:18.667
write big letters, “Mother, I get my
headache. I can’t get rid of it.”

08:18.868 --> 08:23.124
Now those days are gone when Mother has
to cure your headache,

08:23.325 --> 08:29.100
look after your wife, look after your
children. Is all finished now.

08:29.301 --> 08:34.279
Now you are responsible, not only
for yourself,

08:34.480 --> 08:41.886
but for your ashrams, for your cities,

08:42.100 --> 08:46.834
for your countries and for the whole world.

08:47.342 --> 08:50.461
Now, assume your powers.

08:50.662 --> 08:56.568
Like yesterday he sang, or he played,
‘The Royal Court’ (Nishat Khan).

08:56.798 --> 09:01.450
So now you are in The Royal Court. Take up
your responsibilities!

09:01.651 --> 09:08.048
Everybody has to feel responsible.
And assume what you are.

09:08.272 --> 09:13.409
Know your powers, what you can do.
Sit down.

09:13.610 --> 09:17.820
Now, the days are gone when you had
to sit down and count your blessings.

09:18.021 --> 09:20.984
Now you have to count your powers:

09:21.200 --> 09:26.616
“How many powers I have and what I can
use and how I can use.”

09:26.847 --> 09:30.515
No use counting your miracles. You have
had enough miracles to prove

09:30.706 --> 09:35.903
that you are sahaja yogis and that you are
helped by the Paramchaitanya.

09:36.104 --> 09:38.806
But now know how much of that
Paramachaitanya

09:39.006 --> 09:42.851
you are going to use yourself, how you
are going to manoeuvre it

09:43.052 --> 09:46.571
and how you are going to work out.

09:47.598 --> 09:54.356
This is the New Era we are starting
from today.

09:54.557 --> 09:59.950
And this is the day I was waiting for all
of you to realise

10:00.151 --> 10:04.238
that you are not sahaja yogis for only
your selfish ends,

10:04.439 --> 10:09.470
nor for your families, nor for your
communities,

10:09.671 --> 10:12.701
nor for your country, but for the whole
world.

10:12.902 --> 10:16.872
Expand yourself. You must have that vision
before you,

10:17.073 --> 10:20.518
that I have put many a times before
you people,

10:20.719 --> 10:23.565
that – you have to emancipate the humanity.

10:23.766 --> 10:26.361
Now don’t have diffidence.

10:26.562 --> 10:31.236
First of all, you should not think that,
“We are very ordinary people.

10:31.437 --> 10:35.646
We are very ordinary. We haven’t got
something special about it.”

10:35.847 --> 10:38.195
This work is not going to be done
by special people

10:38.395 --> 10:42.146
because they are suffering from ego.

10:42.347 --> 10:45.911
It is going to be done by people who don’t
have that ego

10:46.112 --> 10:52.825
of great success or of great achievements
or riches or anything.

10:53.026 --> 10:57.147
If they are rid of this, then only they can
work it out.

10:57.348 --> 11:01.753
And that’s why it is for you to understand
what Christ has said

11:01.954 --> 11:13.312
that a camel can pass through the hole
of a needle, but not a rich man.

11:13.513 --> 11:17.080
Because the ego is too big, bigger than
a camel, bigger than an elephant,

11:17.281 --> 11:20.858
any animal you could think of.

11:21.059 --> 11:25.732
That’s why now as we are entering into
new awareness,

11:25.933 --> 11:32.875
let us not worry about our negative
thinking.

11:34.148 --> 11:39.819
So, first is the diffidence: “How can I be?
I am not all right.

11:40.020 --> 11:45.111
I was like this. I was doing like this.
I had done like this.”

11:45.333 --> 11:48.064
So many letters of confessions come to me,

11:48.265 --> 11:52.178
pages after pages, which I throw away
or burn them off.

11:52.379 --> 11:55.682
There is no need to confess any more.
There’s only one confession,

11:55.883 --> 11:59.933
that “I am a sahaja yogi and now, after
twenty-first of Sahasrara,

12:00.134 --> 12:03.295
I am a Maha Yogi.”

12:04.990 --> 12:07.242
This is the confession you have to make.

12:07.443 --> 12:11.499
And no more of all these out-of-date things
that people tell me

12:11.700 --> 12:15.458
about your family’s life and all mundane,
nonsensical things.

12:15.659 --> 12:19.042
We have given them up and we have come
to Sahaja Yoga for our ascent.

12:19.243 --> 12:24.181
We have achieved our ascent and now
for what? For what?

12:24.382 --> 12:29.657
Have achieved our ascent is to emancipate
human beings,

12:29.858 --> 12:36.861
to help them out of the mire of ignorance,
of darkness.

12:37.751 --> 12:46.803
The main target, I feel today, should not
be so much political as fundamentalism.

12:47.004 --> 12:50.090
So we have to openly say to these
fundamentalists

12:50.291 --> 12:52.316
that, “You are nonsensical. You don’t know
the truth.

12:52.517 --> 12:56.102
You don’t know anything about truth.
You don’t know that you are the Spirit.

12:56.303 --> 12:58.379
You don’t know that there is a power
that is working.”

12:58.580 --> 13:02.197
You have to tell them very clearly,
“You are all stupid people

13:02.398 --> 13:05.263
running after something that is a mirage

13:05.464 --> 13:09.585
and all of you will end up into hell
as described by all the scriptures.”

13:09.786 --> 13:12.494
We have to openly say it, this thing.

13:12.695 --> 13:14.379
Whichever way you like, you may write
books.

13:14.580 --> 13:17.169
You may publish it. You may tell people
about it.

13:17.370 --> 13:20.155
But now the new announcement has to come
to say

13:20.356 --> 13:26.152
that running after falsehood is not going
to take you to God.

13:26.803 --> 13:31.731
And, in that, they have used the power
of hatred.

13:31.932 --> 13:34.644
So you have to say that, “We believe
in the power of love

13:34.845 --> 13:37.889
and not in the power of hatred that you
believe in.”

13:38.090 --> 13:42.836
For us, everybody is capable of finding
the Truth

13:43.037 --> 13:52.845
and is capable of getting to the heaven
of that paradise,

13:53.046 --> 13:56.154
which is promised to us, the Kingdom
of God.

13:56.355 --> 14:00.856
So, for us, everybody, whether they belong
to this community, that community,

14:01.057 --> 14:05.368
this race or that race, whatever it is,
we believe –

14:05.569 --> 14:11.204
not that – but we are sure, that we all
are quite capable

14:11.405 --> 14:16.361
and blessed by God, that we should enter
into His Kingdom.

14:16.562 --> 14:22.552
If you take this kind of a positive
attitude, your negativity will go away.

14:22.753 --> 14:25.644
Negative forces, as you know, you have
been pulled down

14:25.845 --> 14:31.618
by this kind of a thing or that kind of
a thing, specially after Sahaja Yoga.

14:31.819 --> 14:34.604
Before Sahaja Yoga, we are not attached
to any families or anything.

14:34.805 --> 14:39.347
After Sahaja Yoga you just got attached
to your families, like glued to them.

14:39.548 --> 14:44.304
Absolutely glued. I mean, I had to solve
everybody’s family problems.

14:44.505 --> 14:47.860
Now we have marriages and even after
marriages I find

14:48.061 --> 14:50.835
[that] still people don’t understand what
is a Sahaja Yoga marriage.

14:51.036 --> 14:55.216
And there are still some problems —
very few, but there are.

14:55.417 --> 15:00.926
So this nonsensical problem of “my family,
my wife, my children,

15:01.127 --> 15:07.195
my house, my property, my money,” all this
“my” should be finished first of all.

15:07.396 --> 15:13.033
You have to belong to the world. Any person
who is a king,

15:13.234 --> 15:17.789
[who] does not belong to his kingdom
is a failure, is useless.

15:17.990 --> 15:23.945
If he thinks about himself, about his own
comfort, about his own fame,

15:24.146 --> 15:28.414
about his own achievements, then
he is a failure.

15:28.615 --> 15:33.716
He has to think about the country on which
he is ruling.

15:33.917 --> 15:38.216
In the same way, you have to also turn
your mind away

15:38.417 --> 15:41.636
from all these petty things that you have
been dealing with.

15:41.837 --> 15:43.855
I have been struggling with you, trying
to help you

15:44.056 --> 15:46.509
for every small little nonsensical things.

15:46.710 --> 15:48.727
And many people said that, “Mother,
why should You worry?

15:48.928 --> 15:50.950
You are a saint. Why should You worry
about these things?”

15:51.151 --> 15:54.499
I said, “Unless and until these
entanglements are taken away,

15:54.700 --> 15:56.070
they are not going to come out.”

15:56.271 --> 16:01.647
But now, now you do feel that freedom,
complete freedom.

16:01.848 --> 16:04.923
You are an individual. You are absolutely
free

16:05.124 --> 16:08.009
and the source of your joy is your Spirit.

16:08.210 --> 16:10.292
You are not entangled with anyone.

16:10.493 --> 16:13.303
You are not any way attached to anyone.

16:13.504 --> 16:17.250
In that detachment, you are going
to nourish everyone,

16:17.451 --> 16:20.674
inclusive of so-called your family, your
people,

16:20.875 --> 16:23.648
your country and ultimately the world.

16:23.879 --> 16:31.996
So, to get rid of negativity, first
important thing is to learn detachment.

16:32.197 --> 16:35.341
Detachment comes through thoughtless
awareness.

16:35.542 --> 16:38.676
When you look at anyone or start thinking
about anyone –

16:38.919 --> 16:41.596
get to your state of thoughtless awareness.

16:41.797 --> 16:47.225
Immediately you’ll feel detached and you’ll
know the solution of the whole problem.

16:47.426 --> 16:52.748
Now the greatest power you have is in your
brain, that you are knowledgeable.

16:52.949 --> 16:55.244
Not knowledgeable the way you understand,

16:55.445 --> 16:58.415
that, “what is the chakra, what is
the centre” — not that.

16:58.616 --> 17:00.917
But there is all knowledge within you.

17:01.118 --> 17:05.380
Just you have to get into thoughtless
awareness

17:05.581 --> 17:08.513
and the whole library of knowledge can
open to you.

17:08.699 --> 17:12.464
You know, so many of you have never been
speaking on the stage,

17:12.665 --> 17:16.835
they had stage fear, and you have become
great speakers.

17:17.036 --> 17:21.309
So many of you were possessed people
who couldn’t even stand before me,

17:21.523 --> 17:26.374
have now become leaders and are doing
good job.

17:26.575 --> 17:30.628
In every field you will find that you have
advanced so much.

17:30.809 --> 17:34.189
So many people who never knew how
to sing have started singing,

17:34.390 --> 17:36.646
did not know how to paint have started
painting.

17:36.847 --> 17:40.648
But these are very, very mundane things

17:40.849 --> 17:44.099
which may give us little pleasures here
and there,

17:44.300 --> 17:48.806
but the main thing is how many people
we give Realisation to.

17:49.007 --> 17:51.272
Whether you are a woman, whether you
are man,

17:51.473 --> 17:53.828
whether you are a father, whether you are
a mother,

17:54.029 --> 17:57.300
whether you are a child or a grown up.

17:57.501 --> 18:01.515
Everybody has to see how many people
we can give Realisation to,

18:01.716 --> 18:06.428
how much we can announce about Sahaja
Yoga. That’s the main thing.

18:06.629 --> 18:09.507
Sahaja Yoga is not by the way. And it
happens.

18:09.708 --> 18:12.423
Like, when I went to Australia, I was
surprised

18:12.624 --> 18:16.082
that Sahaja Yoga, which was such a prime
thing for them,

18:16.283 --> 18:21.010
suddenly became by the way. So Sahaja
Yoga is a commitment,

18:21.211 --> 18:24.351
is a commitment and complete involvement.

18:24.552 --> 18:28.030
Otherwise you are really useless for Sahaja
Yoga, absolutely useless.

18:28.231 --> 18:30.912
It’s better to have few people who are
committed

18:31.113 --> 18:34.418
than to have thousands who are just
useless.

18:34.619 --> 18:38.388
So let us see what you have decided
for yourself

18:38.589 --> 18:41.497
and what you have decided for Sahaja Yoga.

18:41.698 --> 18:43.991
If you have decided to opt for Sahaja Yoga,

18:44.192 --> 18:48.291
then just know that this is the main thing
which you have to do.

18:48.495 --> 18:51.650
The whole attention should be on that.

18:51.851 --> 18:56.475
As I told this morning, a very good poem
written by Namadeva

18:56.676 --> 19:01.479
and was included in the Guru Granth Sahib,

19:01.680 --> 19:05.323
that, “A boy is playing with his kite and
the kite is flying in the air.

19:05.524 --> 19:10.394
He’s talking to everyone, but his attention
is on the kite.

19:10.595 --> 19:13.700
There’s a lady who is doing all
the household work.

19:13.901 --> 19:17.560
She is doing all the cleaning, but
the child is on her,

19:17.761 --> 19:23.169
on her back or on her waist. All her
attention is on the child.

19:23.370 --> 19:26.165
Then there are ladies who are taking
water home.

19:26.366 --> 19:31.099
There’s a water pitcher on their heads,
sometimes two, sometimes three.

19:31.300 --> 19:34.749
They’re carrying, balancing it. They’re
talking to each other, laughing,

19:34.950 --> 19:36.946
but the whole attention is on the balance.”

19:37.147 --> 19:41.652
In the same way, your attention should be
all the time on Sahaja Yoga –

19:41.853 --> 19:45.137
“What’s happening in Sahaja Yoga?
Where are we? Where are we going?

19:45.338 --> 19:49.952
Where is Mother? What part She is?
What is She doing?”

19:51.647 --> 19:58.946
That is, now, if you put your attention to,
your negativity will absolutely disappear

19:59.147 --> 20:03.094
because attention which was involved
into negative things

20:03.295 --> 20:08.591
will get absolutely detached and you’ll
start thinking about Sahaja Yoga.

20:08.792 --> 20:13.016
So now, as you are Maha Yogis, we have
to make it a Mahayoga.

20:13.217 --> 20:16.187
And unless and until that level is achieved
by you,

20:16.388 --> 20:18.767
then we should think that you are still
backdated

20:18.968 --> 20:25.905
and I don’t know, in the turning of the
wheel, how many will be left there.

20:26.106 --> 20:30.478
So this is a very big turning point and
today is a very great day for us

20:30.679 --> 20:37.501
because Sahasrara, today, has completed
its twenty-one years

20:37.702 --> 20:42.447
and, like that, it has twenty-one aspects.

20:42.648 --> 20:47.783
Seven, the chakras. Seven into three
of your nadis.

20:47.984 --> 20:55.514
So it’s twenty-one aspects you have been
able to achieve and the twenty-one powers.

20:55.715 --> 20:58.281
You just experiment and see for yourself.

20:58.482 --> 21:01.133
Don’t doubt yourself! Just experiment.

21:01.334 --> 21:04.192
First, you used to even doubt if there is
cool breeze or not,

21:04.393 --> 21:07.799
used to think it’s an air conditioner
working in London!

21:08.000 --> 21:12.994
Even [in] London, they used to think there
must be an air conditioner in their head!

21:13.195 --> 21:15.279
Now those days are gone!

21:15.480 --> 21:20.278
Now don’t doubt yourself and just go
full ahead

21:20.479 --> 21:25.977
with all the maryadas of Sahaja Yoga.
So the maryada has to be there.

21:26.178 --> 21:37.503
Except that the moral maryadas and also
of behavioural maryadas,

21:37.704 --> 21:40.514
there are not many maryadas in Sahaja Yoga.

21:40.715 --> 21:43.827
You can do what you like. You can live
the way you like.

21:44.028 --> 21:46.371
You can eat the way you want to eat.

21:46.572 --> 21:51.599
But the main maryada is that you have to be
very moral people, honest, moral people.

21:51.800 --> 22:00.670
And, also, you have to be, in a way,
in appearance, in behaviour,

22:00.871 --> 22:04.530
such a person that you do not become
obnoxious,

22:04.731 --> 22:09.467
or people don’t think you are queer,
strange people.

22:09.668 --> 22:12.945
To overcome that, we have to dress up
in a way

22:13.146 --> 22:17.641
that is rather more appealing to
the general public

22:17.842 --> 22:24.083
and people see us as normal human being
and as not abnormal human beings.

22:24.284 --> 22:27.713
There’s not much to be done outside.
It is the inside

22:27.914 --> 22:31.861
where we’ll have to prepare ourselves
fully, to accept ourselves,

22:32.062 --> 22:36.342
to tell ourselves every day that we are
now Maha Yogis

22:36.543 --> 22:38.793
and we have to work it out that way.

22:38.994 --> 22:41.777
Today we have here people from all over
the world

22:41.978 --> 22:45.098
and you go and tell this message to all
the rest of the people,

22:45.299 --> 22:49.236
whom I have not met, that “Mother has
already announced,

22:49.437 --> 22:54.517
through the Vishnumaya also, that you all
have become now Maha Yogis.”

22:54.718 --> 23:02.219
And try to express that, manifest that
with full confidence in yourself

23:02.449 --> 23:06.459
and with this power of love, I am sure
you will all win over.

23:06.660 --> 23:09.638
May God bless you all.

23:22.277 --> 23:24.996
There has been nothing written about
Sahasrara before.

23:25.197 --> 23:27.642
In none of the scriptures Sahasrara is
described.

23:27.843 --> 23:30.260
Nobody knew anything about Sahasrara.

23:30.461 --> 23:33.766
They just left it as the seventh chakra —
finished.

23:33.967 --> 23:39.057
They could only go up to Agnya and nothing
has been written about Sahasrara so far.

23:39.258 --> 23:43.436
And there is no mantras written about
Sahasrara,

23:43.637 --> 23:47.897
so we have to now write Sahasrara mantra.

23:48.098 --> 23:53.681
It is very surprising that even
the photographs of Sahasraras

23:53.881 --> 23:59.081
have appeared now for you to see that
your Sahasraras are opening.

23:59.282 --> 24:06.609
And that is something [that] never happened
before in the whole spiritual history

24:07.639 --> 24:13.126
and nobody could write about it because
they never saw this Sahasrara.

24:13.334 --> 24:19.615
Now, for you, it is important to see that
you have something so unique with you.

24:19.830 --> 24:24.436
But only thing what you need is a courage

24:24.637 --> 24:30.558
and a complete commitment to go forward

24:30.759 --> 24:37.994
with this propagation of Sahaja Yoga,
announcement of Sahaja Yoga.
