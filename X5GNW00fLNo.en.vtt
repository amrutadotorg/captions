00:15:56.114 --> 00:16:04.670
As I said yesterday, this is the field, field
where the light has to come.

00:16:05.012 --> 00:16:10.192
With so many lights, the field has to be enlightened.

00:16:10.192 --> 00:16:25.232
And this field which is enlightened is enriched
by nature, too.

00:16:25.232 --> 00:16:33.662
And when you were singing I felt the clouds
were catching the notes, weaving them within

00:16:33.662 --> 00:16:40.341
themselves and when it would rain, the rain
will sing the song again.

00:16:40.341 --> 00:16:51.052
As if the valleys were resounding so beautifully
and the echo was very gentle and filling the

00:16:51.052 --> 00:16:53.841
whole atmosphere.

00:16:53.841 --> 00:17:00.122
Perhaps you are not aware of the subtle, of
the Divine, how much It is anxious to work

00:17:00.122 --> 00:17:01.922
it out.

00:17:01.922 --> 00:17:18.182
But our trumpets
and our flutes and our drums have to be all

00:17:18.182 --> 00:17:19.792
right.

00:17:19.792 --> 00:17:36.702
There has to be coordination, complete synchronizing,
then the melody is played in a beautiful way.

00:17:36.702 --> 00:17:45.602
Clouds only carry the purest water, the purest
hymns.

00:17:45.602 --> 00:17:55.322
So when we are spreading the message, we have
to understand that it has to come from a pure

00:17:55.322 --> 00:17:59.781
source, purity is very important.

00:17:59.781 --> 00:18:06.092
I’ve already talked about chastity part
which is the Mooladhara, which is so important

00:18:06.092 --> 00:18:11.102
today; you can see it clearly how important
it is.

00:18:11.102 --> 00:18:20.121
But that’s not the end of it; that’s just
the beginning, just the beginning.

00:18:20.121 --> 00:18:34.711
But what we have to see is something very
innate built within us.

00:18:34.711 --> 00:18:44.012
And today as we are sitting in the heart of
hearts that is Sheffield where the steel is

00:18:44.012 --> 00:18:54.502
made, in the heart the steel, sometimes you
need a part of steel also in the heart.

00:18:54.502 --> 00:19:01.681
We have to see where are we lacking, what’s
our basic problem.

00:19:01.681 --> 00:19:07.311
We should face it.

00:19:07.311 --> 00:19:19.642
So as English we are, we have to think how
our brains work, are used to work, how traditionally

00:19:19.642 --> 00:19:22.402
we have been brought to problems.

00:19:22.402 --> 00:19:30.152
When we see around how we have accepted some
things which were very absurd and nonsensical,

00:19:30.152 --> 00:19:39.512
say in America or in France and other places,
as if we have no personality of our own.

00:19:39.512 --> 00:19:46.212
What did we give to others?

00:19:46.212 --> 00:19:50.832
What is the impression people carry about
the British?

00:19:50.832 --> 00:20:07.592
Hippies, or what do you call these days modern
- the punks.

00:20:07.592 --> 00:20:13.792
What is it that we have to give?

00:20:13.792 --> 00:20:21.342
Is a honorable image, is a honorable image
of the British, of the English.

00:20:21.342 --> 00:20:30.162
We have to be honored, we have to be honorable
people, and we must keep our honor.

00:20:30.162 --> 00:20:44.662
And honor cannot come or cannot be expressed
if we are people who are cunning.

00:20:44.662 --> 00:20:55.191
That’s very superficial, anybody can find
out if we have that cunning within us.

00:20:55.191 --> 00:21:03.592
Now it has been a character, can be very cunning
- that’s what I discussed this morning.

00:21:03.592 --> 00:21:06.682
Be careful on that, be careful.

00:21:06.682 --> 00:21:16.962
That’s a trick of the ego, don’t fall
a prey to that.

00:21:16.962 --> 00:21:21.072
And that then works out in our languages also.

00:21:21.072 --> 00:21:27.102
Now English language is a specially honored
language now because it is the language of

00:21:27.102 --> 00:21:30.482
the Sahaja Yoga as well.

00:21:30.482 --> 00:21:37.492
Of course we use Hindi, Marathi and then English.

00:21:37.492 --> 00:21:46.282
But English is the language in which My speeches
are, so it should be honored.

00:21:46.282 --> 00:21:52.672
We must have a sense of honor that comes by
respecting.

00:21:52.672 --> 00:21:55.932
When you respect yourself, you respect others.

00:21:55.932 --> 00:21:59.872
If you do not respect yourself, you cannot
respect others.

00:21:59.872 --> 00:22:09.232
And that’s what I’ve discovered that when
people took to anti-culture and all sorts

00:22:09.232 --> 00:22:16.141
of things the first thing they did was not
to respect anything whatsoever.

00:22:16.141 --> 00:22:23.701
And yesterday only I discovered that the language
which is spoilt has come through this: is

00:22:23.701 --> 00:22:30.612
fashionable to speak with a funny accent,
and I was copying that the Americans speak

00:22:30.612 --> 00:22:34.061
like duck – quack, quack, quack.

00:22:34.061 --> 00:22:46.742
But the English speak like a crow - caw, caw,
caw - and we have real English language problem.

00:22:46.742 --> 00:22:49.082
Just now Nick’s wife told Me that she can’t
understand what English speak.

00:22:49.082 --> 00:22:53.172
I said, “Same here, I don’t understand
either.”

00:22:53.172 --> 00:22:58.152
It’s a language problem.

00:22:58.152 --> 00:23:04.522
One gentleman who came from India, very well
educated gentleman, did his MA in English,

00:23:04.522 --> 00:23:10.511
he came back and he said, “I had a language
problem there.”

00:23:10.511 --> 00:23:11.832
I said, “Why?”

00:23:11.832 --> 00:23:18.432
He said, “They speak all kinds, they divert
it every way and educated people talk like

00:23:18.432 --> 00:23:19.432
that.”

00:23:19.432 --> 00:23:26.112
And was surprised that it has also come from
anti-culture, is a fashion to speak like that.

00:23:26.112 --> 00:23:29.932
And I can’t follow.

00:23:29.932 --> 00:23:36.762
That means it is anti-God.

00:23:36.762 --> 00:23:39.352
So you must respect your language.

00:23:39.352 --> 00:23:46.162
You might be acquiring it from hippie stage,
or you might be getting it, say, even from

00:23:46.162 --> 00:23:50.441
Cambridge or from Oxford or from public schools.

00:23:50.441 --> 00:23:59.482
Whatever it is, whatever may be the source,
either it is aggression on the language or

00:23:59.482 --> 00:24:04.451
no respect to the language.

00:24:04.451 --> 00:24:15.722
So in language, in speaking the language,
try to speak straightforward English language.

00:24:15.722 --> 00:24:17.832
Because we are international people.

00:24:17.832 --> 00:24:20.122
We are not English anymore.

00:24:20.122 --> 00:24:23.712
We are grown to be global people now.

00:24:23.712 --> 00:24:33.251
We have a global personality, and as global
people we have to speak a language which everybody

00:24:33.251 --> 00:24:34.752
can understand.

00:24:34.752 --> 00:24:37.592
We cannot speak cockneyed language.

00:24:37.592 --> 00:24:39.941
I mean in India also we have lots of cockneyed.

00:24:39.941 --> 00:24:48.191
But Sahaja Yogis don’t speak that language.

00:24:48.191 --> 00:24:55.121
You won’t understand that cockneyed language
that we speak even if you are an expert on

00:24:55.121 --> 00:24:58.061
any Indian language.

00:24:58.061 --> 00:25:10.272
So first of all, you must show respect of
your own language, more than anything else.

00:25:10.272 --> 00:25:17.402
If you cannot respect your country, your language,
your literature, your sublime things that

00:25:17.402 --> 00:25:23.631
are here, your buildings, how can you respect
anything else?

00:25:23.631 --> 00:25:29.871
This is your soil, which is not to be aggressed
this way.

00:25:29.871 --> 00:25:36.381
That doesn’t mean we become nationalist,
I did not mean that, but to grow out as a

00:25:36.381 --> 00:25:42.732
tree you have to know your soil and you have
to respect and be honorable.

00:25:42.732 --> 00:25:47.692
Where is that English honor which I used to
hear about?

00:25:47.692 --> 00:25:50.761
Is lost in the thin air somewhere?

00:25:50.761 --> 00:25:59.891
An honorable person will not keep back taxes,
will not ill-treat his wife, will not ill-treat

00:25:59.891 --> 00:26:07.912
her husband, will not talk rudely to them,
would be respectable, will respect the children.

00:26:07.912 --> 00:26:14.422
First thing is that he respects everybody’s
freedom.

00:26:14.422 --> 00:26:21.922
If he’s mean, then he’s not honorable.

00:26:21.922 --> 00:26:27.422
If he’s not generous, then he is not honorable.

00:26:27.422 --> 00:26:34.451
If he disobeys the law, he’s not honorable
either.

00:26:34.451 --> 00:26:35.761
Why should we disobey the law?

00:26:35.761 --> 00:26:37.962
I just don’t understand.

00:26:37.962 --> 00:26:42.382
Actually English laws are meant for angels
I tell you, horrible.

00:26:42.382 --> 00:26:45.322
But in that only the devils take advantage.

00:26:45.322 --> 00:26:52.582
Doesn’t matter, laws are very good no doubt.

00:26:52.582 --> 00:26:54.712
But why should we break the laws unnecessarily?

00:26:54.712 --> 00:26:59.852
If it is necessary, all right.

00:26:59.852 --> 00:27:05.112
But for every small thing if you start breaking
the laws, then we start breaking the laws

00:27:05.112 --> 00:27:09.031
of the Divine also.

00:27:09.031 --> 00:27:11.002
So we have to learn all these things.

00:27:11.002 --> 00:27:21.372
Let us be in an honorable way, accept things
which are good but not fashionable.

00:27:21.372 --> 00:27:28.552
Fashionable things - now it is fashionable
to be like this, it is fashionable to be like

00:27:28.552 --> 00:27:29.552
that.

00:27:29.552 --> 00:27:37.942
Now what I feel that fashion only is accepted
by people who have no personality at all.

00:27:37.942 --> 00:27:45.702
Tomorrow somebody starts saying that “You
put a empty tin of jam on your head.”

00:27:45.702 --> 00:27:52.962
Supposing, I mean, if they say so, “You’ll
look taller,” or something like that.

00:27:52.962 --> 00:27:59.402
I mean maybe a little, or let the jam falls
on your face.

00:27:59.402 --> 00:28:03.781
Any clownish nonsense we accept so easily.

00:28:03.781 --> 00:28:11.612
It’s all clownish, and clowns are the only
ones who copy like this because they have

00:28:11.612 --> 00:28:13.692
to amuse people by clowning.

00:28:13.692 --> 00:28:20.872
But are we to become clowns now?

00:28:20.872 --> 00:28:28.842
So by this kind of diffidence in our character
that we try to copy others without understanding

00:28:28.842 --> 00:28:32.882
what they are doing, we are becoming clowns.

00:28:32.882 --> 00:28:39.251
I mean you can see many like that.

00:28:39.251 --> 00:28:45.572
So the clownishness is now one of the characters
of the British.

00:28:45.572 --> 00:28:52.712
They really sometimes appear to Me like clowns.

00:28:52.712 --> 00:29:02.232
Because they try to copy others and whenever
you try to copy others, you are not the others.

00:29:02.232 --> 00:29:08.281
Like say we try to copy, say for example,
Americans - very difficult.

00:29:08.281 --> 00:29:14.352
They are so childish and stupid, we can’t
do that good, you see.

00:29:14.352 --> 00:29:24.462
I’ve seen a film of some Americans - I hope
there are no Americans sitting here - where

00:29:24.462 --> 00:29:32.272
they had about hundred people, actors and
actresses above seventy or eighty years of

00:29:32.272 --> 00:29:38.622
age all shaking, you see, and they all wearing
funny dresses, you see, half way missing,

00:29:38.622 --> 00:29:46.472
or this way missing, all sorts of things missing,
you see, less clothes than normal.

00:29:46.472 --> 00:29:54.292
And they were doing funny dances, you see,
all walking with sticks and doing shake.

00:29:54.292 --> 00:29:58.962
Or they were shaking already.

00:29:58.962 --> 00:30:08.872
Now for English they love to use their umbrellas
I think.

00:30:08.872 --> 00:30:17.622
So they look clownish because you don’t
carry sticks, you carry umbrellas.

00:30:17.622 --> 00:30:21.372
So trying to do something that is American
would be stupid.

00:30:21.372 --> 00:30:25.562
There’s no need to copy them.

00:30:25.562 --> 00:30:29.582
Even outside, then why inside?

00:30:29.582 --> 00:30:39.622
When you are a global personality, as in the
nature you can see a mango tree looks like

00:30:39.622 --> 00:30:41.162
a mango tree.

00:30:41.162 --> 00:30:47.732
It doesn’t try to become like an apple tree,
does it?

00:30:47.732 --> 00:30:53.092
And then that mango, when it is ripe, goes
to the whole world.

00:30:53.092 --> 00:30:57.612
Whatever is the best mango you can find it
in Russia, you can find it in America, you

00:30:57.612 --> 00:30:58.702
can find it all over.

00:30:58.702 --> 00:31:02.891
That’s how it becomes a global personality.

00:31:02.891 --> 00:31:05.902
But mango remains a mango; it is not an apple.

00:31:05.902 --> 00:31:12.902
Who is going to import apples from India,
in England?

00:31:12.902 --> 00:31:16.781
That would be stupid.

00:31:16.781 --> 00:31:23.741
So the personality that you are already, you
are a British personality, or English personality

00:31:23.741 --> 00:31:32.082
or an Irish personality, or whatever personality
you are, should be such is presentable to

00:31:32.082 --> 00:31:35.842
others to be cherished, to be enjoyed.

00:31:35.842 --> 00:31:38.552
How is it possible?

00:31:38.552 --> 00:31:46.592
You have to be excellent, first class, top
personality.

00:31:46.592 --> 00:31:49.852
So this clownishness must be given up.

00:31:49.852 --> 00:31:56.352
And it has come so much in England that I
feel the heart is absolutely oppressed by

00:31:56.352 --> 00:31:59.292
this stupid things.

00:31:59.292 --> 00:32:04.272
But there are certain nonsensical things which
have come within us which we should give up.

00:32:04.272 --> 00:32:12.172
As I said, first of all the cunningness, then
in our language there should be straightforward

00:32:12.172 --> 00:32:15.052
expression, no sarcasm.

00:32:15.052 --> 00:32:23.432
There’s no intelligence in sarcasm.

00:32:23.432 --> 00:32:35.702
Saying something nice to others is a great
art.

00:32:35.702 --> 00:32:46.102
Have we developed that art of saying something
nice to others?

00:32:46.102 --> 00:32:55.932
This art is to be developed by Sahaja Yogis,
how to say something sweet and nice to others.

00:32:55.932 --> 00:33:12.531
If you can develop the gentle method of saying
nice things, then later on you will see you

00:33:12.531 --> 00:33:18.751
will be able to do nice things for others
- little, little things here and there.

00:33:18.751 --> 00:33:24.202
Like the little girl bringing beautiful pink
flowers one after another.

00:33:24.202 --> 00:33:36.271
You are nice to Me no doubt, but to each other
and to others who come to us?

00:33:36.271 --> 00:33:48.332
So how to say nice things, what to say, when
to say, this we must learn.

00:33:48.332 --> 00:33:52.842
And so we can establish communication.

00:33:52.842 --> 00:34:00.182
Self-consciousness, self-opinionatedness can
never give you that.

00:34:00.182 --> 00:34:05.092
“I don’t care, all right let him be angry,
so what do I care?”

00:34:05.092 --> 00:34:11.312
Very common expression.

00:34:11.312 --> 00:34:14.291
But if you say to the person, “Why are you
angry?

00:34:14.291 --> 00:34:16.872
I do care when you are angry.

00:34:16.872 --> 00:34:18.462
What’s the problem?

00:34:18.462 --> 00:34:20.222
Can I not help you there?”

00:34:20.222 --> 00:34:21.291
Finished.

00:34:21.291 --> 00:34:29.262
He’ll say, “What sort of a angel I’m
meeting here?”

00:34:29.262 --> 00:34:34.412
Like yesterday the fellow was very aggressive
and he asked Me about heaven and hell and

00:34:34.412 --> 00:34:35.412
all that.

00:34:35.412 --> 00:34:38.812
I was least bothered.

00:34:38.812 --> 00:34:42.461
He was neutralized.

00:34:42.461 --> 00:34:46.102
You must learn, this is an art which one has
to learn.

00:34:46.102 --> 00:34:51.231
Don’t be proud of your harsh tongues and
your hot tempers.

00:34:51.231 --> 00:34:52.231
Don’t be proud.

00:34:52.231 --> 00:34:54.082
“I’m angry with him.”

00:34:54.082 --> 00:34:57.342
So what, is it a very good thing to be angry
with others?

00:34:57.342 --> 00:35:03.612
“I got very angry,” you see, with very
great pride they will tell Me.

00:35:03.612 --> 00:35:09.852
“I got very angry for that.”

00:35:09.852 --> 00:35:10.892
‘Why?

00:35:10.892 --> 00:35:16.822
As Christ has said, only one anger is allowed:
if somebody says something against your Mother

00:35:16.822 --> 00:35:18.712
that He’s not going to tolerate.

00:35:18.712 --> 00:35:23.072
But that, too, controlled.

00:35:23.072 --> 00:35:25.812
Yesterday many were angry but it was all right.

00:35:25.812 --> 00:35:32.332
I know how to manage things.

00:35:32.332 --> 00:35:42.491
So we have to learn also to tell ourselves,
“Let us not be so self-opinionated.”

00:35:42.491 --> 00:35:46.092
We have to learn a lot.

00:35:46.092 --> 00:35:53.912
There is so much to be seen, so much to be
learnt, so much to be understood, outside

00:35:53.912 --> 00:35:58.002
also.

00:35:58.002 --> 00:36:05.112
Like British are absolutely insular by temperament.

00:36:05.112 --> 00:36:10.612
Another matching with them are Japanese, equal
type.

00:36:10.612 --> 00:36:16.892
Japanese also don’t talk much but don’t
absorb anything whatsoever.

00:36:16.892 --> 00:36:22.712
You can imagine three hundred years English
were in India, they learnt nothing.

00:36:22.712 --> 00:36:24.502
Can you imagine?

00:36:24.502 --> 00:36:26.902
Can you believe it?

00:36:26.902 --> 00:36:34.481
Three hundred years, generations, seven-eight
generations they were in India.

00:36:34.481 --> 00:36:40.022
While here, when the Indians come, they too
have no personality.

00:36:40.022 --> 00:36:43.511
They pick up your dresses, they pick up your
language, they pick up everything.

00:36:43.511 --> 00:36:49.722
They talk with the same slang and hundred
times they’ll say dirty words in it and

00:36:49.722 --> 00:36:56.122
they’ll say, “Yes man, no man, what man”
- to a woman also, unisex.

00:36:56.122 --> 00:37:02.462
They have too much absorbage.

00:37:02.462 --> 00:37:09.622
They absorb everything while you don’t absorb
anything.

00:37:09.622 --> 00:37:13.832
So these are two extreme cases.

00:37:13.832 --> 00:37:27.962
So as it is said in Sanskrit that what is
the difference between the swan and hamsa

00:37:27.962 --> 00:37:28.962
and the crow?

00:37:28.962 --> 00:37:36.452
No, no sorry, crow is black so I’m sorry
- hamsa and what do you call that?

00:37:36.452 --> 00:37:37.651
Crane, crane.

00:37:37.651 --> 00:37:44.742
What is the difference between a crane - yes
it is crane, isn’t it Gavin, in the water?

00:37:44.742 --> 00:37:45.742
Crane.

00:37:45.742 --> 00:37:54.652
So what is the difference between the crane
and the swan?

00:37:54.652 --> 00:38:04.201
So when they have to discriminate between
water and milk, then you can find out who

00:38:04.201 --> 00:38:08.761
is the crane and who is the swan.

00:38:08.761 --> 00:38:11.912
Nirak shira viveket.

00:38:11.912 --> 00:38:16.122
Vivek is proper decision.

00:38:16.122 --> 00:38:23.812
So if you put water mixed with milk before
a swan, the swan will just suck in the milk

00:38:23.812 --> 00:38:27.472
and the crane will suck the whole.

00:38:27.472 --> 00:38:30.712
He wouldn’t know.

00:38:30.712 --> 00:38:36.072
So that is what is, again we come to the same
point, is discretion that we have to develop.

00:38:36.072 --> 00:38:37.752
[Shri Mataji interrupts Her talk to point
out people] There are people they are looking

00:38:37.752 --> 00:38:38.752
out for us.

00:38:38.752 --> 00:38:40.092
They are lost there.

00:38:40.092 --> 00:38:44.932
They are Sahaja Yogis.

00:38:44.932 --> 00:38:48.192
I think they saw us here.

00:38:48.192 --> 00:38:51.692
They saw Me.

00:38:51.692 --> 00:39:00.022
So it is the discretion that we have to pick
up all that is good, all that is nice, from

00:39:00.022 --> 00:39:04.392
everywhere, which is such a lot, such a lot.

00:39:04.392 --> 00:39:10.152
Like I would say, what’s nice about British?

00:39:10.152 --> 00:39:17.531
Let’s see.

00:39:17.531 --> 00:39:42.222
Can you tell Me, who is going to tell Me that?

00:39:42.222 --> 00:39:50.182
Yogi: They have a great deal of tolerance.

00:39:50.182 --> 00:39:53.732
Shri Mataji: What did he say?

00:39:53.732 --> 00:39:54.732
Tolerance.

00:39:54.732 --> 00:39:57.292
No, no, not at all.

00:39:57.292 --> 00:40:02.652
It has to be a common quality, whether you
are a Sahaja Yogi or not.

00:40:02.652 --> 00:40:08.082
Tolerance is the least, that’s something
lacking.

00:40:08.082 --> 00:40:14.632
Yogi: They’re good leaders, Mother.

00:40:14.632 --> 00:40:20.352
Shri Mataji: You think so?

00:40:20.352 --> 00:40:25.302
Yogi: Fair play.

00:40:25.302 --> 00:40:34.792
Shri Mataji: Fair play I don’t know now
- that might have been.

00:40:34.792 --> 00:40:36.632
They were not very fair with Indians, were
they?

00:40:36.632 --> 00:40:42.412
They were not very fair with Chinese, never.

00:40:42.412 --> 00:40:44.982
Still go further.

00:40:44.982 --> 00:40:50.732
Yogi: Talking about the weather.

00:40:50.732 --> 00:40:56.021
Shri Mataji: That would be bad weather.

00:40:56.021 --> 00:41:02.642
Yes, I mean superficiality, but that’s not
a good thing.

00:41:02.642 --> 00:41:07.862
Yogi: Shri Mataji, they have very sharp minds.

00:41:07.862 --> 00:41:10.472
Shri Mataji: Sharp what?

00:41:10.472 --> 00:41:11.782
Sharp minds.

00:41:11.782 --> 00:41:13.082
Yogi: Intelligence.

00:41:13.082 --> 00:41:16.962
Shri Mataji: You’re near, but not there.

00:41:16.962 --> 00:41:19.362
Yogi: Inventions, Mother.

00:41:19.362 --> 00:41:26.541
Shri Mataji: Not so much, Americans are better.

00:41:26.541 --> 00:41:29.172
Yogi: Subtle.

00:41:29.172 --> 00:41:33.122
Shri Mataji: Subtle.

00:41:33.122 --> 00:41:40.271
I wouldn’t say that.

00:41:40.271 --> 00:41:42.252
Not that, not so much.

00:41:42.252 --> 00:41:48.972
Yogi: They want to help others.

00:41:48.972 --> 00:41:52.332
Shri Mataji: Seldom.

00:41:52.332 --> 00:41:54.572
Yogi: Manipulative

00:41:54.572 --> 00:41:59.062
Shri Mataji: That’s bad.

00:41:59.062 --> 00:42:02.422
Yogi: Loyal, Mother.

00:42:02.422 --> 00:42:05.782
Shri Mataji: Loyal?

00:42:05.782 --> 00:42:10.271
They create disloyalties, problems.

00:42:10.271 --> 00:42:12.122
They make people fight.

00:42:12.122 --> 00:42:24.112
Yogi: Once they find something good Mother
they will stick onto it.

00:42:24.112 --> 00:42:28.402
Shri Mataji: I wish they could.

00:42:28.402 --> 00:42:31.682
I wish they could, but the way they disappeared,
every time we had programs after that what

00:42:31.682 --> 00:42:34.952
I find everything disappeared.

00:42:34.952 --> 00:42:37.662
Sticking on quality is missing.

00:42:37.662 --> 00:42:39.932
Now is all right everybody has said?

00:42:39.932 --> 00:42:44.222
I wish you had all those qualities, you could,
why not?

00:42:44.222 --> 00:42:49.542
So all the qualities that are desired have
been expressed, but what really are?

00:42:49.542 --> 00:42:53.202
Should I tell you?

00:42:53.202 --> 00:42:54.202
Scholarship.

00:42:54.202 --> 00:42:55.202
Scholarship.

00:42:55.202 --> 00:42:56.872
Sahaja Yoga?

00:42:56.872 --> 00:42:58.702
Read everything.

00:42:58.702 --> 00:43:06.532
Sahaja Yoga means Kundalini, means this, that,
go to the library, find out everything.

00:43:06.532 --> 00:43:09.252
Just know it.

00:43:09.252 --> 00:43:10.252
Scholarship.

00:43:10.252 --> 00:43:12.891
That’s their quality.

00:43:12.891 --> 00:43:19.982
And this has to spread all over.

00:43:19.982 --> 00:43:24.572
You agree there?

00:43:24.572 --> 00:43:35.422
The scholarship in Sahaja Yoga has to spread
all over the world.

00:43:35.422 --> 00:43:40.192
The women specially want to compete with men
here.

00:43:40.192 --> 00:43:43.092
Very difficult, English women, not easy.

00:43:43.092 --> 00:43:45.021
Not all, but some.

00:43:45.021 --> 00:43:49.402
They should become scholars of Sahaja Yoga.

00:43:49.402 --> 00:44:00.272
I’m surprised people like Derek or people
like Hesta could not see the point.

00:44:00.272 --> 00:44:07.332
Scholarship is the thing and that’s why
they’re honored everywhere.

00:44:07.332 --> 00:44:09.872
They are scholars.

00:44:09.872 --> 00:44:15.352
And see now, heart becoming a scholar.

00:44:15.352 --> 00:44:27.281
That’s the integration of the brain and
the heart.

00:44:27.281 --> 00:44:31.271
We have so many scholars of Sahaja Yoga in
England.

00:44:31.271 --> 00:44:34.872
We might get one there and one here and there.

00:44:34.872 --> 00:44:40.122
Like we can say in Switzerland we’ve got
Gregoire and Arneau.

00:44:40.122 --> 00:44:49.122
Scholarship - how many are there?

00:44:49.122 --> 00:44:54.132
And very deep scholarship.

00:44:54.132 --> 00:45:05.142
And that is what you have to develop more,
specially the ladies have to learn a lot,

00:45:05.142 --> 00:45:08.731
is knowledge.

00:45:08.731 --> 00:45:20.292
To understand all the intricacies, all the
delicacies, and to work it out in that scholarly

00:45:20.292 --> 00:45:30.532
way, is the way you will really do greatest
service to Sahaja Yoga.

00:45:30.532 --> 00:45:38.902
And is such a honorable thing to be a scholar
and once you are a scholar, this knowledge

00:45:38.902 --> 00:45:44.572
goes into your head goes to your heart also.

00:45:44.572 --> 00:45:49.382
Scholarship in every subject.

00:45:49.382 --> 00:45:51.332
Scholars are different from inventive people.

00:45:51.332 --> 00:45:57.742
They may know very little and can invent something,
that’s a different thing.

00:45:57.742 --> 00:46:04.262
But that doesn’t mean you go and read Vivekananda
and all that, doesn’t mean that.

00:46:04.262 --> 00:46:15.372
But you go in every library, every place and
discover the Truth.

00:46:15.372 --> 00:46:28.052
Blake - scholar, so many scholars in this
country, most of them were Realized Souls.

00:46:28.052 --> 00:46:34.052
In England we have the maximum number, in
the West I’m saying, maximum number of scholars,

00:46:34.052 --> 00:46:44.032
who were Realized Souls, in such a small,
little country like that.

00:46:44.032 --> 00:46:51.012
In India of course we had saints who were
scholars, saints who were not scholars.

00:46:51.012 --> 00:47:00.691
So the scholarship part is your responsibility,
and like a scholar you have to be above many

00:47:00.691 --> 00:47:01.691
things.

00:47:01.691 --> 00:47:05.582
A scholar doesn’t stoop down to nonsense.

00:47:05.582 --> 00:47:08.572
He doesn’t take to superficial thing.

00:47:08.572 --> 00:47:16.282
It’s below his dignity to behave in childish
manner or to take to sex and all this nonsensical

00:47:16.282 --> 00:47:19.572
ideas.

00:47:19.572 --> 00:47:25.302
But the basic quality you have got which is
something so great I feel, because heart becoming

00:47:25.302 --> 00:47:27.942
a scholar is something very great.

00:47:27.942 --> 00:47:38.982
It’s a balance, it’s a real balance, and
that’s the steel, that is the steel of England,

00:47:38.982 --> 00:47:40.702
the scholarship.

00:47:40.702 --> 00:47:48.852
That’s how a New Jerusalem has to be built
in, not the old one where they were only faithfuls

00:47:48.852 --> 00:47:57.891
just going down singing songs and hymns, nothing
- but scholarship, the complete knowledge.

00:47:57.891 --> 00:48:02.362
They know everything about Kundalini, they
know all about chakras, they know all details

00:48:02.362 --> 00:48:10.802
about it and, if you may please, your Mother
has spoken in England the maximum number of

00:48:10.802 --> 00:48:20.262
lectures, because there are scholars.

00:48:20.262 --> 00:48:28.871
So preserve that, develop that, then only
you will have all other qualities which you

00:48:28.871 --> 00:48:31.572
have described just now.

00:48:31.572 --> 00:48:36.332
But remember that you are yogis, but scholars
in your subject.

00:48:36.332 --> 00:48:40.522
Take any subject that you are dealing with
- even ordinary thing, we can say if you are

00:48:40.522 --> 00:48:46.671
a carpenter you must know everything about
wood.

00:48:46.671 --> 00:48:51.862
What is this wood, from where it comes, what
is it, what can be used for, what is the density

00:48:51.862 --> 00:49:03.022
of this wood, what is the chemical composition,
everything you must know about it.

00:49:03.022 --> 00:49:14.221
And this is what you have to give to other
people of the world.

00:49:14.221 --> 00:49:21.112
Once you start doing all this, you will give
up all the malpractices which British have

00:49:21.112 --> 00:49:22.112
taken to.

00:49:22.112 --> 00:49:27.282
First of all they are the worst of all, is
to create problems between two persons - they

00:49:27.282 --> 00:49:30.961
are good at it.

00:49:30.961 --> 00:49:38.461
Like, now you see now in South Africa what
they did, create problem between one shade

00:49:38.461 --> 00:49:41.652
of black with another shade of black.

00:49:41.652 --> 00:49:45.411
Very clever.

00:49:45.411 --> 00:49:49.401
Now when this scholarship was perverted they
were the ones, you know they were the ones

00:49:49.401 --> 00:49:52.971
who started this idea that the blacks are
primitive.

00:49:52.971 --> 00:49:56.282
They are the ones who introduced this idea.

00:49:56.282 --> 00:49:58.782
The same scholarship used for bad purposes.

00:49:58.782 --> 00:50:07.992
Who gave these ideas were about four or five
writers who said they were primitive.

00:50:07.992 --> 00:50:19.602
Very nice - brand them as primitive, because
scholars after all can brand anything as anything.

00:50:19.602 --> 00:50:24.362
So it is necessary for us to bring goodness.

00:50:24.362 --> 00:50:35.842
To bring benevolence in this world we must
write benevolent things, write something idealistic,

00:50:35.842 --> 00:50:49.042
something higher, something hopeful, something
which gives them a new dimension of understanding.

00:50:49.042 --> 00:50:53.201
All the Sahaja Yogis must start writing.

00:50:53.201 --> 00:50:56.971
Ramdas Swami has said that, “Every day you
must write something.”

00:50:56.971 --> 00:51:11.391
Write diaries, write novels, write articles,
do what you like - poems, poetry.

00:51:11.391 --> 00:51:21.522
All kinds of things you can do if you just
know that you have to be yogi scholars, but

00:51:21.522 --> 00:51:25.272
not intellectuals.

00:51:25.272 --> 00:51:32.742
Intellectuals have the knowledge of others,
but scholars built up their knowledge on the

00:51:32.742 --> 00:51:34.231
true knowledge of others.

00:51:34.231 --> 00:51:42.492
That’s the difference between a scholar
and an intellectual.

00:51:42.492 --> 00:51:49.202
Intellectual has nothing of his own, he’s
a confused person and he doesn’t want to

00:51:49.202 --> 00:51:54.882
say, because he’s so frightened that if
he says anything that “This is what I think,”

00:51:54.882 --> 00:52:06.691
then people might say that he is a man of
domination or something like that.

00:52:06.691 --> 00:52:14.072
You need not be a graduate, you need not be
anything, but that quality is built within

00:52:14.072 --> 00:52:20.252
you, which is a very big thing and is very
much connected.

00:52:20.252 --> 00:52:33.282
Now in Sahaja Yoga as you know that the heart
is surrounded by seven main auras and these

00:52:33.282 --> 00:52:38.552
come from the brain, which is the seat.

00:52:38.552 --> 00:52:47.342
Now in the center, at the Brahmarandra we
have got the Heart Chakra, all right?

00:52:47.342 --> 00:52:57.981
The heart is here and around it are all these
auras, if you see in the brain.

00:52:57.981 --> 00:53:05.812
In the same way they are surrounding the heart.

00:53:05.812 --> 00:53:17.302
So if you know about them, it will circulate,
the knowledge will circulate, but circulate

00:53:17.302 --> 00:53:28.691
with love, without any aggressiveness, without
any showing off, without any cunning, without

00:53:28.691 --> 00:53:42.522
any sarcasm, in a full, straightforward, loving
manner.

00:53:42.522 --> 00:53:49.981
But for that we have to remember that we have
developed lots of antidotes in England.

00:53:49.981 --> 00:54:01.072
Like the words I have seen people use very
common is: “That may be too much; it may

00:54:01.072 --> 00:54:03.022
be too much.”

00:54:03.022 --> 00:54:05.662
They’re frightened.

00:54:05.662 --> 00:54:12.272
“One shouldn’t say too much.”

00:54:12.272 --> 00:54:13.272
You should!

00:54:13.272 --> 00:54:20.522
When you say too much at least little bit
will go into their heads.

00:54:20.522 --> 00:54:28.371
So you have to say too much, say what you
want.

00:54:28.371 --> 00:54:38.692
There should be exuberance, exuberance of
your ideas so that something goes into their

00:54:38.692 --> 00:54:42.921
heads, they know that you are sincere, you’re
saying it sincerely, you cannot contain within

00:54:42.921 --> 00:54:47.342
yourself, emphatically you have to say things.

00:54:47.342 --> 00:54:50.532
That’s what everybody did.

00:54:50.532 --> 00:54:59.192
All those who were great incarnations said
it with such concern, with such force.

00:54:59.192 --> 00:55:05.151
In the same way you have to say, without any
fear.

00:55:05.151 --> 00:55:08.992
“Oh that may be too much, Mother it was
too much for him.”

00:55:08.992 --> 00:55:13.262
Let him be blasted.

00:55:13.262 --> 00:55:15.402
Doesn’t matter.

00:55:15.402 --> 00:55:22.481
Say everything that you have to say absolutely
with full heart.

00:55:22.481 --> 00:55:34.322
But when people come to Sahaja Yoga, when
they come for, say, a workshop or something,

00:55:34.322 --> 00:55:45.141
we try to be the same party people, like in
the party you see, “What will you have?”

00:55:45.141 --> 00:55:53.302
Then they will say, “All right, let me think
what did I have yesterday, so I’ll have

00:55:53.302 --> 00:55:54.471
today this thing.”

00:55:54.471 --> 00:55:58.782
It’s like a shopping going on.

00:55:58.782 --> 00:56:06.231
No, you have to say, “We have this and please
have it now, otherwise you won’t have it.”

00:56:06.231 --> 00:56:17.631
This is the time, let them say what they like.

00:56:17.631 --> 00:56:19.911
Is important.

00:56:19.911 --> 00:56:29.641
I see sometimes your SDP conferences and all
this, baap re baap [note: this is an expression

00:56:29.641 --> 00:56:32.282
in Hindi to express disappointment], the way
they speak, they just blast you, I mean hammer

00:56:32.282 --> 00:56:33.282
in your head.

00:56:33.282 --> 00:56:38.401
And why should we not when this is the truth?

00:56:38.401 --> 00:56:44.092
Why should we not tell them, and talk to them
in that manner?

00:56:44.092 --> 00:56:52.631
We think by being gentle - all right gentleness
is different, but I mean to say by saying

00:56:52.631 --> 00:56:57.792
less than I see, understatement is typical
English statement.

00:56:57.792 --> 00:57:00.191
“That might be too much.”

00:57:00.191 --> 00:57:08.142
In Sahaja Yoga it is such a lot that how much
are you going to pour out?

00:57:08.142 --> 00:57:10.622
Can never be too much, so be careful on that.

00:57:10.622 --> 00:57:15.431
When you have to say it, say it in a very
blasty way, doesn’t matter.

00:57:15.431 --> 00:57:16.431
What are they going to do?

00:57:16.431 --> 00:57:20.322
They can’t crucify Me this time, can they?

00:57:20.322 --> 00:57:23.161
They dare not.

00:57:23.161 --> 00:57:27.312
Otherwise perfectly all right, nothing can
touch Me, and even crucifixion cannot touch

00:57:27.312 --> 00:57:31.492
Me, you know that.

00:57:31.492 --> 00:57:36.342
So you better say what you have found out
in a big way and tell them in a big way.

00:57:36.342 --> 00:57:42.592
Of course loving and gentle manner, but tell
them, the concern should be there.

00:57:42.592 --> 00:57:45.961
All right?

00:57:45.961 --> 00:57:53.002
Now this is what it is, one has to understand,
that there is nothing “Say little bit.”

00:57:53.002 --> 00:57:58.252
Then they think he is a shaky man.

00:57:58.252 --> 00:58:03.522
But when they sing horrible songs on the mike,
eating the mike I say, calling, “eating

00:58:03.522 --> 00:58:04.522
the mike music.”

00:58:04.522 --> 00:58:14.992
They go on, you see, aggressing on the mike
and people go mad with it, they like it.

00:58:14.992 --> 00:58:21.431
I don’t say you aggress, but don’t say
anything less, understatement is not needed.

00:58:21.431 --> 00:58:29.242
There should be not be any balancing in that.

00:58:29.242 --> 00:58:39.802
Those people who will be appeased by that
will not be good Sahaja Yogis.

00:58:39.802 --> 00:58:42.371
They cannot come in the Kingdom of God.

00:58:42.371 --> 00:58:54.092
We don’t have to be begging of them but
we have to honor them, we have to respect

00:58:54.092 --> 00:58:56.532
them, we have to be kind to them.

00:58:56.532 --> 00:59:00.022
But we have to give them what we have.

00:59:00.022 --> 00:59:04.931
Like in the family you go, you get everything
from the fridge and give it to them, they’ll

00:59:04.931 --> 00:59:06.352
be very happy - take it whatever you like.

00:59:06.352 --> 00:59:10.092
What a spread.

00:59:10.092 --> 00:59:21.621
But if you put one little fish and two eggs
for ten people with one chili to say that

00:59:21.621 --> 00:59:31.651
it is Sahaja Yoga, maybe a lemon, they will
think, “What’s this going on here?

00:59:31.651 --> 00:59:32.651
Wishy-washy stuff.”

00:59:32.651 --> 00:59:40.681
Now that’s one thing.

00:59:40.681 --> 00:59:49.981
Secondly there are words that people use very
commonly: “That is very fussy.”

00:59:49.981 --> 00:59:52.671
That shows your fears.

00:59:52.671 --> 01:00:02.553
In Sahaja Yoga nothing is fussy, nothing is
fussy.

01:00:02.553 --> 01:00:03.553
Always it is so.

01:00:03.553 --> 01:00:08.022
“It is very fussy, it is this is fussy that
is fussy.”

01:00:08.022 --> 01:00:16.242
It is coming to such an extent that people
now like beggarish existence; they want to

01:00:16.242 --> 01:00:26.262
dress up like beggars, rustic, nonsensical
things, worn-out clothes, worn-out faces.

01:00:26.262 --> 01:00:29.231
I was telling Gavin the other day, “Why
do you all like sand color?

01:00:29.231 --> 01:00:30.231
There’s no sand here.

01:00:30.231 --> 01:00:32.981
Is something Arabic in you that you like all
sand everywhere?”

01:00:32.981 --> 01:00:48.382
As it is the hair are blonde, face is sand-like,
clothes are sand.

01:00:48.382 --> 01:00:56.292
Mountains of sand, walking around.

01:00:56.292 --> 01:00:59.691
Why not be colorful?

01:00:59.691 --> 01:01:03.032
Why not wear colors?

01:01:03.032 --> 01:01:06.072
Sahaja Yogis must wear colors.

01:01:06.072 --> 01:01:07.451
Of course you should not be dandies.

01:01:07.451 --> 01:01:14.622
I must tell you that, otherwise you will be
dandies, you see, like wearing shocking pinks

01:01:14.622 --> 01:01:17.322
by men, and sort of thing.

01:01:17.322 --> 01:01:18.481
I don’t mean that.

01:01:18.481 --> 01:01:24.421
But you shouldn’t just go about with sand
color and a grey color.

01:01:24.421 --> 01:01:30.632
If you start wearing something nice, they
will also produce.

01:01:30.632 --> 01:01:34.092
I wanted to buy a sweater for Gavin in green
color.

01:01:34.092 --> 01:01:35.911
I couldn’t get one light green.

01:01:35.911 --> 01:01:37.421
I said, “Let’s have one.”

01:01:37.421 --> 01:01:38.632
I said, “You look.”

01:01:38.632 --> 01:01:40.302
No, couldn’t get one for him.

01:01:40.302 --> 01:01:42.042
They don’t make it - only sand.

01:01:42.042 --> 01:01:47.822
And I got it.

01:01:47.822 --> 01:01:49.762
Or else grey.

01:01:49.762 --> 01:01:57.522
Already the sky is grey, faces are grey, dresses
are grey, they wear grey suits, the horses

01:01:57.522 --> 01:02:00.312
are grey, the world is around grey – all
horrible.

01:02:00.312 --> 01:02:05.572
And then wear a grey dress to match with it.

01:02:05.572 --> 01:02:15.552
So, there’s nothing like fussy in Sahaja
Yoga but you should not be childish, frivolous,

01:02:15.552 --> 01:02:16.552
stupid.

01:02:16.552 --> 01:02:21.572
And you should not be also dandyish, showing
off.

01:02:21.572 --> 01:02:28.802
Like I have seen people painting their car
with gold and all that nonsense, or wearing

01:02:28.802 --> 01:02:39.842
a bow tie and a dinner jacket and walking
on the streets of Oxford Street to match with

01:02:39.842 --> 01:02:49.691
these horrible Hare Ramas there, to make a
contrast to them.

01:02:49.691 --> 01:02:54.181
That’s not necessary.

01:02:54.181 --> 01:03:03.072
On this also you could be scholars, you can
find out.

01:03:03.072 --> 01:03:11.592
About children, I’m very much worried now,
much more since I heard about this three-year-old

01:03:11.592 --> 01:03:14.862
girl.

01:03:14.862 --> 01:03:20.282
And I have to say that your children are precious,
they’re wonderful people.

01:03:20.282 --> 01:03:26.412
In the beginning they have suffered because
of you, but they come out of it, and they

01:03:26.412 --> 01:03:27.492
become so great.

01:03:27.492 --> 01:03:33.342
But you must learn one thing, is to be very
attentive to your children, don’t neglect

01:03:33.342 --> 01:03:34.342
them.

01:03:34.342 --> 01:03:39.822
Teach them habits by which they do not learn
things which will destroy them.

01:03:39.822 --> 01:03:46.382
Like every child picks up everything, puts
it in the mouth.

01:03:46.382 --> 01:03:51.502
We too here in England or anywhere in the
West, people just put their fingers in the

01:03:51.502 --> 01:03:54.641
mouth like that they will go.

01:03:54.641 --> 01:03:57.332
Anything they’ll just - supposing they are
opening a can.

01:03:57.332 --> 01:04:04.782
Now the can spills out some jam, so they put
it in the fingers inside.

01:04:04.782 --> 01:04:05.782
No.

01:04:05.782 --> 01:04:09.342
That jam can, might be having some germs.

01:04:09.342 --> 01:04:13.402
So anything that is to be put in the mouth
you must wash.

01:04:13.402 --> 01:04:20.812
That’s now has to be the law for Sahaja
Yogis, because so many germs, so many things,

01:04:20.812 --> 01:04:23.172
and for children specially they must be told.

01:04:23.172 --> 01:04:27.622
If anything falls on the ground it’s a very
mundane thing but you must learn how we tell

01:04:27.622 --> 01:04:28.711
our children.

01:04:28.711 --> 01:04:31.492
Anything falls on the ground, immediately
you’ll pick up and throw away somewhere

01:04:31.492 --> 01:04:32.492
and wash our hands.

01:04:32.492 --> 01:04:35.961
We’ll just say, “No, no, no, no, no, no,
not that.”

01:04:35.961 --> 01:04:42.981
Even from the mouth, if something falls out
you are not to pick up.

01:04:42.981 --> 01:04:48.921
Unless and until you really fanatically do
that, your children cannot be saved from all

01:04:48.921 --> 01:04:53.302
kinds of infections that are around.

01:04:53.302 --> 01:04:58.171
India is full of parasites and we have many
more, I mean we are the country where we breed

01:04:58.171 --> 01:05:01.231
and look after them and cherish them I think.

01:05:01.231 --> 01:05:11.441
All kinds of parasites we have had, politically
also many parasites on us, but all said and

01:05:11.441 --> 01:05:21.062
done, we know how to keep out of them, you
see, and that’s how we have to really condition

01:05:21.062 --> 01:05:22.891
our children.

01:05:22.891 --> 01:05:27.012
Secondly, never to leave your child alone
anywhere.

01:05:27.012 --> 01:05:30.971
Learn a lesson.

01:05:30.971 --> 01:05:34.421
At any cost you should not leave the child
alone.

01:05:34.421 --> 01:05:40.171
You can leave it with somebody who can look
after the child, who can run a crèche, who

01:05:40.171 --> 01:05:43.032
can do something of that kind.

01:05:43.032 --> 01:05:50.842
But pay attention to this point that there
should be no loneliness for a child.

01:05:50.842 --> 01:05:57.532
Child must be made to sleep in your room,
maybe another cot, maybe crib.

01:05:57.532 --> 01:06:03.832
When slightly grown up, still should be with
you, if there’s a grown-up another child

01:06:03.832 --> 01:06:08.772
you can make, or some aunt or somebody sleeping
with.

01:06:08.772 --> 01:06:13.262
But don’t make children feel that they are
lonely.

01:06:13.262 --> 01:06:18.052
Psychologically it will affect, and also physically
there could be a problem.

01:06:18.052 --> 01:06:23.492
We never, never, never allow our children
to be alone, do you know that, in India?

01:06:23.492 --> 01:06:28.822
I mean we are ourselves surprised how the
children just go out.

01:06:28.822 --> 01:06:33.652
Now supposing some child, say about five-year-old
says, “I’m going to a candy shop.”

01:06:33.652 --> 01:06:34.652
Nothing doing.

01:06:34.652 --> 01:06:39.431
Mother will say, “All right, when I go you
will buy it, candy.”

01:06:39.431 --> 01:06:46.502
I mean when My daughters were not married,
till then they never went out alone, can you

01:06:46.502 --> 01:06:47.721
believe it?

01:06:47.721 --> 01:06:48.721
Never.

01:06:48.721 --> 01:06:52.111
Even to school if they were going, they were
in the car with the driver.

01:06:52.111 --> 01:06:55.692
Even if they were going to colleges they were
going in the car with the driver.

01:06:55.692 --> 01:06:56.692
Never alone.

01:06:56.692 --> 01:07:03.421
And if they were going, say, by buses or anything,
later on when they went to higher education,

01:07:03.421 --> 01:07:10.471
they were going with friends.

01:07:10.471 --> 01:07:16.151
Safety of children has to be looked after
in this negative atmosphere everywhere.

01:07:16.151 --> 01:07:21.671
We are very good because we have this challenge
all the time, so we are very careful, and

01:07:21.671 --> 01:07:27.971
you people have to be now made more aware
towards your children.

01:07:27.971 --> 01:07:31.842
But don’t spoil them, you spoil your children
too much.

01:07:31.842 --> 01:07:36.141
I know they are very joy-giving because they
are Realized Souls.

01:07:36.141 --> 01:07:40.762
But tell them, “You are Realized Souls and
you cannot be dishonorable.”

01:07:40.762 --> 01:07:41.981
But not at the time.

01:07:41.981 --> 01:07:46.492
I’ve seen that you correct your children
when they’ll misbehave, “Don’t do that!”

01:07:46.492 --> 01:07:47.812
That’s not the way.

01:07:47.812 --> 01:07:49.062
Then you dishonor.

01:07:49.062 --> 01:07:52.121
You sit down with them, have a conference.

01:07:52.121 --> 01:07:54.602
“We’ll have a conference now,” you tell
them.

01:07:54.602 --> 01:07:56.121
“We’ll sit down.”

01:07:56.121 --> 01:08:05.992
So let them feel, let them sit on their chairs
like a conference hall, and tell them, “Now

01:08:05.992 --> 01:08:07.902
see we are all Sahaja Yogis.

01:08:07.902 --> 01:08:11.481
You are Sahaja Yogis, too, and the whole world
is watching you.

01:08:11.481 --> 01:08:13.701
You have to be honorable children.

01:08:13.701 --> 01:08:17.072
You have to behave yourself, you have to do
this way.

01:08:17.072 --> 01:08:21.641
We have to share our things otherwise they
will say you are not Sahaja Yogi.

01:08:21.641 --> 01:08:22.641
You have to have dignity.”

01:08:22.641 --> 01:08:29.192
You talk to them, develop their personality
that way, so that they know they have to be

01:08:29.192 --> 01:08:31.211
majestic, they have to be regal.

01:08:31.211 --> 01:08:35.231
They cannot be cheapish like others.

01:08:35.231 --> 01:08:39.651
Because all the time we say, “Don’t touch
that, don’t do that.”

01:08:39.651 --> 01:08:42.161
They don’t know, they are confused.

01:08:42.161 --> 01:08:49.422
Talk to them, sit down, talk to them - what
is to be done, how we have to behave, how

01:08:49.422 --> 01:08:59.151
to say nice things, how to help others, how
to share your things, how to give your toys,

01:08:59.151 --> 01:09:02.122
how to keep your things, how to be neat, how
to be tidy.

01:09:02.122 --> 01:09:06.542
It’s a training, that’s what you have
to do.

01:09:06.542 --> 01:09:10.971
And children also learn from your own behavior.

01:09:10.971 --> 01:09:15.951
Now you tell your children not to drink and
if you drink like a fish, then how will they

01:09:15.951 --> 01:09:16.951
listen to you?

01:09:16.951 --> 01:09:22.221
In the same way in Sahaja Yoga also, you do
not meditate, you are not disciplined, you

01:09:22.221 --> 01:09:29.891
live in a very untidy manner, you are extremely
careless, you do not honor people, your tongue

01:09:29.891 --> 01:09:35.932
is very loose, or you are very sharp, children
pick up.

01:09:35.932 --> 01:09:38.072
They absorb these things so quickly.

01:09:38.072 --> 01:09:39.072
It’s amazing how children absorb.

01:09:39.072 --> 01:09:41.131
Once I had taken a child to a circus just
- he was a very good child, a Realized Soul.

01:09:41.131 --> 01:09:42.362
We went there and the joker, you see, he took
out his upper pant just while going on a swing,

01:09:42.362 --> 01:09:43.362
so it was a big feat, you see, a joker.

01:09:43.362 --> 01:09:44.362
So we came home, he also took out his pant.

01:09:44.362 --> 01:09:45.362
I said, “Why?”

01:09:45.362 --> 01:09:46.362
He said, “In the circus how he did I’m
going to do the same way.”

01:09:46.362 --> 01:09:47.621
Imagine, that’s the only thing he picked
up.

01:09:47.621 --> 01:09:52.992
I said, “But that was a joker, you are not
a joker are you?”

01:09:52.992 --> 01:09:55.111
“No I’m not.”

01:09:55.111 --> 01:09:58.651
“And better wear your pant.”

01:09:58.651 --> 01:10:06.742
So children pick up wrong things because easy
to pick up that.

01:10:06.742 --> 01:10:08.611
So don’t do anything wrong.

01:10:08.611 --> 01:10:13.502
Another is husband/wife should never quarrel
in the presence of children.

01:10:13.502 --> 01:10:18.471
If you want to quarrel I can even lend you
some sticks, you can fight.

01:10:18.471 --> 01:10:23.542
Fight in your bedrooms, do what you like.

01:10:23.542 --> 01:10:31.721
You can break the heads or break the hearts
or do what you like, but outside your rooms

01:10:31.721 --> 01:10:34.502
you are wonderful husband and wife.

01:10:34.502 --> 01:10:40.572
At least let your children be good, enjoying
husband and wife.

01:10:40.572 --> 01:10:49.851
Actually it is stupid to fight because you
must learn how to enjoy each other.

01:10:49.851 --> 01:10:56.802
So we come from scholarship to the scholarship
about children.

01:10:56.802 --> 01:10:59.322
Some people have to take it up seriously.

01:10:59.322 --> 01:11:05.901
Of course there is a little book which Louise
has nicely done up, but is not sufficient.

01:11:05.901 --> 01:11:12.181
Some three-four people have to sit down, or
some ladies could do it with some doctor there

01:11:12.181 --> 01:11:13.522
or something.

01:11:13.522 --> 01:11:20.191
Sit down with the full compiling of the ideas
of Sahaja Yoga about children.

01:11:20.191 --> 01:11:28.951
Another one can do the education, because
Sahaja Yoga will be boring for you.

01:11:28.951 --> 01:11:31.721
What will you do?

01:11:31.721 --> 01:11:36.191
So much to be done about the education of
the children.

01:11:36.191 --> 01:11:42.471
Is very important because every time I go
to a place, there’s a school being started,

01:11:42.471 --> 01:11:44.322
“What have we to do for the school?

01:11:44.322 --> 01:11:45.961
How are we to conduct?”

01:11:45.961 --> 01:11:52.851
Now why not you people make some research
and give Me the ideas and I’ll put it through?

01:11:52.851 --> 01:11:59.111
I’m good at correcting than creating, I
think nowadays, because so much I have created.

01:11:59.111 --> 01:12:04.691
Whatever I have created is to be rearranged
and consolidated.

01:12:04.691 --> 01:12:11.112
So I can consolidate whatever you give Me,
I can consolidate, I can put right, I can

01:12:11.112 --> 01:12:12.112
correct it.

01:12:12.112 --> 01:12:15.812
So best thing is now to form a committee for
this.

01:12:15.812 --> 01:12:22.441
One for children, one for book on children,
on Sahaja Yoga.

01:12:22.441 --> 01:12:25.762
What Mother has to say about, you can use
My quotations.

01:12:25.762 --> 01:12:31.181
Then a book about the education of children.

01:12:31.181 --> 01:12:33.542
Third book has to be about the married life.

01:12:33.542 --> 01:12:40.072
That’s how you can go on compiling, about
the social life, about the politics, has to

01:12:40.072 --> 01:12:41.941
come from England.

01:12:41.941 --> 01:12:50.971
A series, so much to be done in England.

01:12:50.971 --> 01:12:56.471
Because people read that, it can be always
translated from one to another.

01:12:56.471 --> 01:12:58.002
Is very easy.

01:12:58.002 --> 01:13:02.351
So I would request you all to put your mind
to this whatever are your interests you should

01:13:02.351 --> 01:13:07.052
work it out and put it in the language of
Sahaja Yoga.

01:13:07.052 --> 01:13:14.851
Every sort - sports, you can take to gardening,
or anything, even machinery.

01:13:14.851 --> 01:13:19.042
Bring it to the level of Sahaja Yoga.

01:13:19.042 --> 01:13:23.542
Like computer, now all the developing countries
want to develop computers.

01:13:23.542 --> 01:13:29.022
Now we must find out what are the problems
of computerization, then how it is going to

01:13:29.022 --> 01:13:34.921
affect socially, deeply, in the future, what
can happen if we just develop computers and

01:13:34.921 --> 01:13:41.242
nothing else, how if it is one-sided movement
then how the whole suffers.

01:13:41.242 --> 01:13:50.612
Like that a new dimension, a new all-pervading,
solution of everything can be done.

01:13:50.612 --> 01:13:58.842
And that can be a quite a big eye-opener to
people who do not want to commit the same

01:13:58.842 --> 01:14:01.101
mistakes that you have committed.

01:14:01.101 --> 01:14:06.542
I must say this Affluent Society and all these
books that Galbraith wrote was very helpful

01:14:06.542 --> 01:14:11.621
to some people, and that’s how it should
be.

01:14:11.621 --> 01:14:18.012
So you can guide people who want to be like
you, and you can guide the people who are

01:14:18.012 --> 01:14:22.121
like you and who have to change.

01:14:22.121 --> 01:14:24.191
It should be your idea.

01:14:24.191 --> 01:14:29.161
Drama - what’s wrong with our drama, what’s
wrong with that and how we can improve it.

01:14:29.161 --> 01:14:33.431
Everyone of you is capable of contributing
something like that.

01:14:33.431 --> 01:14:37.822
So those who are interested in different,
various type of things, in this seminar you

01:14:37.822 --> 01:14:42.952
can decide what one likes and what another
thing - like even racial discrimination we

01:14:42.952 --> 01:14:45.782
can take a subject like that somebody can
work it out.

01:14:45.782 --> 01:14:50.572
Why racial discrimination has come, what are
the bad effects of racial discrimination?

01:14:50.572 --> 01:14:56.532
If it comes from English, they will say, “What
generous, good people there are, how they

01:14:56.532 --> 01:15:02.772
understand the feelings and how they …” That
will be very soothing if it comes on the other

01:15:02.772 --> 01:15:03.772
side.

01:15:03.772 --> 01:15:08.111
Then now we have a problem of women asking
for their rights and all that what you call

01:15:08.111 --> 01:15:12.502
feminist movement - what is wrong with the
feminist movement, how they have gone wrong,

01:15:12.502 --> 01:15:13.802
and all those things.

01:15:13.802 --> 01:15:20.142
In every subject, even in economics and everything,
you can go forward with the scholarly ideas.

01:15:20.142 --> 01:15:24.312
You can take help from other countries also
who - we have scholars everywhere.

01:15:24.312 --> 01:15:27.562
But we have maximum number of scholars here.

01:15:27.562 --> 01:15:31.661
And this is what we have to do in this land
of She-field.

01:15:31.661 --> 01:15:38.572
May God bless you all.

01:15:38.572 --> 01:15:45.701
Should we meditate for about say, ten minutes?

01:15:45.701 --> 01:15:56.772
Will be good idea, just to meditate and to
find out what chakras are catching, to find

01:15:56.772 --> 01:15:58.341
out what side is weak.

01:15:58.341 --> 01:16:04.312
Now if your left side is weak, put your left
hand towards Me and right hand towards the

01:16:04.312 --> 01:16:05.312
Mother Earth.

01:16:05.312 --> 01:16:10.862
If the right side is weak you put the right
hand towards Me and the left hand up there.

01:16:10.862 --> 01:16:17.512
Now if both are all right, when they normalize
you put both of them towards Me, all right?

01:16:17.512 --> 01:16:26.901
For example, now you can tell because you
are in east end, what’s the problem of east

01:16:26.901 --> 01:16:30.752
end is.

01:16:30.752 --> 01:16:34.611
Survey it.

01:16:34.611 --> 01:16:36.882
You should find out the problems of east end.

01:16:36.882 --> 01:16:44.951
I remember you told Me about some Sikhs, what
they were doing, drinking so much and doing

01:16:44.951 --> 01:16:48.432
all these things which is against, against
Nanak Sahib.

01:16:48.432 --> 01:16:54.742
And all these things if you tell, the way
they run after white skin.

01:16:54.742 --> 01:16:58.992
Yes, that’s what it is.

01:16:58.992 --> 01:17:02.701
So face-to-face let us see what is wrong with
us.

01:17:02.701 --> 01:17:03.802
What is wrong with you?

01:17:03.802 --> 01:17:05.542
With what is wrong with others?

01:17:05.542 --> 01:17:10.562
Let us see as a witness, not identified with
anything.

01:17:10.562 --> 01:17:20.742
So if you tell all those things you see - what
is that, what makes people that way?

01:17:20.742 --> 01:17:28.532
You go into it from both the sides, and you
can give real good solutions, you can give

01:17:28.532 --> 01:17:29.532
solutions.

01:17:29.532 --> 01:17:39.112
For example there are doctors who can make
a book with the divine knowledge related to

01:17:39.112 --> 01:17:40.292
the medicine.

01:17:40.292 --> 01:17:46.481
There are psychologists, they can make a book
- Gregoire I think, Rustom has done a good

01:17:46.481 --> 01:17:47.481
job, I don’t know.

01:17:47.481 --> 01:17:59.211
Now by the way I must ask who has got Rustom’s
book?

01:17:59.211 --> 01:18:01.901
You have got?

01:18:01.901 --> 01:18:08.872
Derek you have?

01:18:08.872 --> 01:18:20.492
Yogi: No I haven’t, Mother.

01:18:20.492 --> 01:18:29.792
I haven’t seen it.

01:18:29.792 --> 01:18:38.152
Shri Mataji: Somebody who is not here may
be having.

01:18:38.152 --> 01:18:43.352
Who else?

01:18:43.352 --> 01:18:48.552
Ask Maureen.

01:18:48.552 --> 01:18:49.552
Is she here?

01:18:49.552 --> 01:18:50.552
Maureen?

01:18:50.552 --> 01:18:51.552
She’s not here?

01:18:51.552 --> 01:18:52.552
Ask her maybe.

01:18:52.552 --> 01:18:57.871
Do you think so, Maureen may be having?

01:18:57.871 --> 01:19:00.911
No.

01:19:00.911 --> 01:19:13.072
I just don’t understand.

01:19:13.072 --> 01:19:27.422
I think you better see in your office maybe,
Gavin, just have a look, no?

01:19:27.422 --> 01:19:34.451
Because I gave it to someone, because it’s
not there in the house, can’t find it.

01:19:34.451 --> 01:19:41.982
We had found his book, isn’t it?

01:19:41.982 --> 01:19:43.052
No.

01:19:43.052 --> 01:19:50.632
All right, he’s a scholar, no doubt, and
I wanted Derek, you to read that because really,

01:19:50.632 --> 01:19:52.372
it’s really dynamic.

01:19:52.372 --> 01:19:55.862
Dynamic is the word for that.

01:19:55.862 --> 01:20:04.392
You can blast all the Jungians and all the
psychologists together.

01:20:04.392 --> 01:20:10.762
I must find it out, otherwise somebody should
write to him that God knows where it is Mother

01:20:10.762 --> 01:20:11.762
is very anxious.

01:20:11.762 --> 01:20:13.212
I must publish that book.

01:20:13.212 --> 01:20:20.702
So now if you come out with sensible good
books authentic, worked out, you have to work

01:20:20.702 --> 01:20:25.772
for a book, you cannot just write anything
off hand.

01:20:25.772 --> 01:20:40.712
Like William Blake and Sahaja Yoga, relate
it to Sahaja Yoga.

01:20:40.712 --> 01:20:46.642
Now before meditation any questions, is there?

01:20:46.642 --> 01:20:49.632
Did you ask any questions there?

01:20:49.632 --> 01:20:53.271
No one?

01:20:53.271 --> 01:20:54.271
Any question?

01:20:54.271 --> 01:21:02.882
Yes, what is it?

01:21:02.882 --> 01:21:18.062
[Yogi’s question is inaudible]

01:21:18.062 --> 01:21:19.062
Shri Mataji: Loud.

01:21:19.062 --> 01:21:20.062
It’s so fast that it’s like Portuguese
to Me.

01:21:20.062 --> 01:21:21.062
Can you tell Me Gavin?

01:21:21.062 --> 01:21:22.062
Yogi: He is saying there should be some organization
by which it’s known whether any particular

01:21:22.062 --> 01:21:23.062
one of Your speeches is being or has been
transcribed, so that there’s no duplication.

01:21:23.062 --> 01:21:24.062
Shri Mataji: There’s no…?

01:21:24.062 --> 01:21:25.062
Yogi: Duplication of effort.

01:21:25.062 --> 01:21:26.062
Because he wants for Your speeches to be transcribed
from the tapes and he doesn’t want to do

01:21:26.062 --> 01:21:27.062
one and it’s already been transcribed.

01:21:27.062 --> 01:21:28.062
Shri Mataji: Are you doing some… you’re
transcribing.

01:21:28.062 --> 01:21:29.062
Yogi: Not at the moment Shri Mataji.

01:21:29.062 --> 01:21:30.062
I used to worry – every time Shri Mataji
has a very nice speech sometimes I just felt

01:21:30.062 --> 01:21:33.152
like transcribing it but I was worried maybe
someone is doing it already.

01:21:33.152 --> 01:21:34.662
Shri Mataji: What’s it…

01:21:34.662 --> 01:21:52.042
Yogi: He’s worried that if he does the transcript
somebody else may be doing the transcription

01:21:52.042 --> 01:22:06.922
so it would be a wasted effort.

01:22:06.922 --> 01:22:13.302
Shri Mataji: Agreed.

01:22:13.302 --> 01:22:20.732
Now who are transcribing - they form a group.

01:22:20.732 --> 01:22:24.642
You are transcribing?

01:22:24.642 --> 01:22:33.942
Who else, will you stand up, you also stand
up please.

01:22:33.942 --> 01:22:37.282
Now you know each other don’t you?

01:22:37.282 --> 01:22:45.472
Yogi: Mother I’m quite prepared to take
a list because I’ve got a computer.

01:22:45.472 --> 01:22:46.812
Shri Mataji: What is it?

01:22:46.812 --> 01:22:49.772
Yogi: He said he can make the list on his
computer.

01:22:49.772 --> 01:22:50.852
To make a list…

01:22:50.852 --> 01:22:56.802
Shri Mataji: Yes I think amongst these four
who are transcribing, all right.

01:22:56.802 --> 01:22:58.472
You decide among yourselves.

01:22:58.472 --> 01:23:12.222
Yogi: But there are many more internationally
Shri Mataji and it should be advised to all

01:23:12.222 --> 01:23:13.222
centers.

01:23:13.222 --> 01:23:14.222
Shri Mataji: You see in other languages, which
are being translated.

01:23:14.222 --> 01:23:15.222
Yogi: Even in English

01:23:15.222 --> 01:23:17.192
Shri Mataji: Like say Australia - whatever
I have said there in Australia they should

01:23:17.192 --> 01:23:18.272
transcribe.

01:23:18.272 --> 01:23:24.532
That what I have said in England they should,
in every country whatever I’ve said should

01:23:24.532 --> 01:23:28.902
be transcribed by that country, is better
to make it systematic.

01:23:28.902 --> 01:23:30.922
All right?

01:23:30.922 --> 01:23:33.092
Is all right now?

01:23:33.092 --> 01:23:38.672
So four of you here should transcribe whatever
I’ve said in England, which is going to

01:23:38.672 --> 01:23:40.262
be a hard task.

01:23:40.262 --> 01:23:52.522
Some more people should raise their hands,
who would like to do transcribing.

01:23:52.522 --> 01:24:02.552
Please stand up, Derek and Louise, you take
down their names, take down their names.

01:24:02.552 --> 01:24:09.302
You give your names, write in on a chit of
paper.

01:24:09.302 --> 01:24:17.722
And now you form a group and tell them how
to transcribe.

01:24:17.722 --> 01:24:21.922
What else?

01:24:21.922 --> 01:24:34.322
First of all you must understand My Indian
English, otherwise you can’t, or they call

01:24:34.322 --> 01:24:38.862
it King’s English I don’t know why but
they say so.

01:24:38.862 --> 01:24:41.234
Shri Mataji: Yes, how are you?

01:24:41.234 --> 01:24:42.902
Yogi: Getting better I hope Mother.

01:24:42.902 --> 01:24:49.382
Shri Mataji: That’s good you look better,
thank you.

01:24:49.382 --> 01:24:52.652
May God bless you.

01:24:52.652 --> 01:24:57.592
What is the next?

01:24:57.592 --> 01:25:11.902
It’s very, very constructive.

01:25:11.902 --> 01:25:25.032
Now editing, once you have transcribed somebody
has to edit it also.

01:25:25.032 --> 01:25:31.162
Not like Indians - whatever when I speak I
say sometimes, “You see,” “Do you understand?”

01:25:31.162 --> 01:25:36.222
All these things need not be there but they
think that nothing should be missed of Mother.

01:25:36.222 --> 01:25:38.432
But I would say that something is needed.

01:25:38.432 --> 01:25:44.902
I mean, you cannot go on just adding these
things after all, so we can remove some of

01:25:44.902 --> 01:25:50.842
these things, this type of pauses that I’ve
used.

01:25:50.842 --> 01:25:52.652
Because talking is different from writing.

01:25:52.652 --> 01:26:05.262
But in any case when you do it I’ll have
to go through them, before we publish them.

01:26:05.262 --> 01:26:16.902
But so many lectures of Mine have duplicates,
repetitions.

01:26:16.902 --> 01:26:23.562
So once you have done, transcription then
we can see that, we can adjust.

01:26:23.562 --> 01:26:30.522
Sometimes certain things are to be said once,
sometimes twice, and sometimes hundred and

01:26:30.522 --> 01:26:32.612
eight times.

01:26:32.612 --> 01:26:40.412
For example, “I am not guilty.”

01:26:40.412 --> 01:26:46.332
All right, so any other thing?

01:26:46.332 --> 01:26:48.022
This was very constructive I must say.

01:26:48.022 --> 01:26:49.022
Yes?

01:26:49.022 --> 01:26:50.022
Yogi: Mother in one of the Nirmala Yogas there’s
a little diagram which You have drawn of the

01:26:50.022 --> 01:26:51.022
Kundalini coming up through the chakras and
going round two circles and then coming up

01:26:51.022 --> 01:26:52.022
to the next one.

01:26:52.022 --> 01:26:55.502
I can’t find from it if the Kundalini is
coming up and going round and then continuing

01:26:55.502 --> 01:27:02.542
up the same side or if it’s crossing over
at each junction.

01:27:02.542 --> 01:27:12.522
Supposing I am doing the right side, is it
coming up and going round and continuing up

01:27:12.522 --> 01:27:23.672
the right side every time, or does it come
up the right side, go round twice and go to

01:27:23.672 --> 01:27:27.782
the left, go round and come up.

01:27:27.782 --> 01:27:35.432
Shri Mataji: No it goes in a spiral way and
cuts it at a point, and makes a chakra.

01:27:35.432 --> 01:27:40.332
You see it’s a sympathetic nervous system
which is left and right.

01:27:40.332 --> 01:27:43.422
It goes in a spiral, all right?

01:27:43.422 --> 01:27:49.362
And it cuts it at a point because it goes
in a spiral - that’s the chakra.

01:27:49.362 --> 01:27:54.782
But I think we have done that in one of the
speeches, is so.

01:27:54.782 --> 01:27:58.912
Once this is transcribed, that will be a source.

01:27:58.912 --> 01:28:03.382
Then everything I’ve said, all these things,
I’ve said it in very great details, you

01:28:03.382 --> 01:28:07.252
will have to locate it.

01:28:07.252 --> 01:28:22.632
What else now?

01:28:22.632 --> 01:28:23.632
What is it?

01:28:23.632 --> 01:28:24.632
Yes, Gavin you tell Me?

01:28:24.632 --> 01:28:27.572
Yogi: What is to be done with the water that
is used in puja, afterwards?

01:28:27.572 --> 01:28:35.502
When we wash the Feet, what use is to be made
of the water, how is it to be dispersed?

01:28:35.502 --> 01:28:45.372
Say at home when we do a little puja and we
just wash Your Feet in the photograph, what’s

01:28:45.372 --> 01:28:49.012
the proper way to dispose of it?

01:28:49.012 --> 01:28:51.402
Shri Mataji: The photograph or Feet?

01:28:51.402 --> 01:28:57.992
Photograph, you see, that becomes vibrated
water, you can use for any purpose, you can

01:28:57.992 --> 01:29:03.862
put it for trees, you can do all these things
external use, you can use for anything.

01:29:03.862 --> 01:29:08.922
But if you have cleaned the photograph and
all that and if it is a clean photograph then

01:29:08.922 --> 01:29:13.422
you can use it for drinking also, is all right,
can be used for drinking also.

01:29:13.422 --> 01:29:18.612
Because vibrations are such that they kill
all germs, everything.

01:29:18.612 --> 01:29:21.642
Because now for Ganges water we just drink
like that, no problem.

01:29:21.642 --> 01:29:23.072
It never gets spoilt.

01:29:23.072 --> 01:29:26.502
You keep it for months together never gets
spoilt.

01:29:26.502 --> 01:29:33.012
Because falling from the head of Shiva never
gets spoilt, that’s the sign of the River

01:29:33.012 --> 01:29:34.222
Ganges.

01:29:34.222 --> 01:29:45.142
Yogi: He’s asking what is Your advice about
fasting?

01:29:45.142 --> 01:29:51.052
Shri Mataji: No, you can fast but not in the
name of God.

01:29:51.052 --> 01:29:54.112
If you want to fast you can fast but not in
the name of God.

01:29:54.112 --> 01:29:55.472
God doesn’t want you to fast.

01:29:55.472 --> 01:30:01.932
Nor does He want you to eat like a glutton
but, He wants you to enjoy the food, whatever

01:30:01.932 --> 01:30:03.452
He has given you.

01:30:03.452 --> 01:30:08.692
It should be: you should pray over the thing,
you should give vibrations to your food and

01:30:08.692 --> 01:30:09.692
enjoy.

01:30:09.692 --> 01:30:13.592
God has given you everything and you should
eat what is needed for you.

01:30:13.592 --> 01:30:16.922
But you should not starve, you should not
fast in the name of God.

01:30:16.922 --> 01:30:19.042
Don’t torture yourself in the name of God.

01:30:19.042 --> 01:30:21.562
That’s very anti-God activity, I think.

01:30:21.562 --> 01:30:25.022
Like poor fellow yesterday that Vivekananda
tortured him, imagine?

01:30:25.022 --> 01:30:31.822
He’s gone through all that for four years,
too much.

01:30:31.822 --> 01:30:37.902
It makes Me really very sad that people are
tortured in the name of God.

01:30:37.902 --> 01:30:55.042
Yogi: Should there be a magazine with all
the poems?

01:30:55.042 --> 01:30:56.502
Shri Mataji: Yes, we have a magazine?

01:30:56.502 --> 01:30:58.492
Yogi: He’s saying, “Could we have one?”

01:30:58.492 --> 01:31:00.392
Shri Mataji: With the poems?

01:31:00.392 --> 01:31:09.702
Only thing I’ll say, poems are to be very
much still to be put right.

01:31:09.702 --> 01:31:16.052
Magazine for Sahaja Yogis is all right, but
if you have to put it out, then they have

01:31:16.052 --> 01:31:24.533
to be little bit, brought up-to-date, I mean
in the sense that they have to be more, sort

01:31:24.533 --> 01:31:32.012
of, edited, and one has to work on them.

01:31:32.012 --> 01:31:39.462
And the poems should be brought out as magazines
but they have to go through proper understanding

01:31:39.462 --> 01:31:40.462
and things.

01:31:40.462 --> 01:31:48.342
Even sometimes people write funny, funny types
of poems also, like somebody will say, “Sahaja

01:31:48.342 --> 01:31:56.272
Yoga is my rice and Sahaja Yoga is my daal,
and Sahaja Yoga is my meat and Sahaja Yoga

01:31:56.272 --> 01:31:57.902
is my fish.”

01:31:57.902 --> 01:32:05.192
And I said, “Next will be and Mataji is
my food.”

01:32:05.192 --> 01:32:14.132
You see they mean that it is everything, but
the way they express is sometimes really crude.

01:32:14.132 --> 01:32:29.052
Yes, there was a poem like that I tell you,
and I got a fright of My life you see.

01:32:29.052 --> 01:32:35.112
So, I would say that one has to be little
careful.

01:32:35.112 --> 01:32:43.292
You see there are two things always in expression.

01:32:43.292 --> 01:32:47.622
First is creativity.

01:32:47.622 --> 01:32:59.652
Of course, you have to be a creative person
but you must have the technique.

01:32:59.652 --> 01:33:08.342
If you don’t have the technique, then this
creativity looks bizarre.

01:33:08.342 --> 01:33:18.332
So even if you have ideas, very poetic ideas,
you must have the technique of putting it

01:33:18.332 --> 01:33:20.862
in.

01:33:20.862 --> 01:33:25.702
Prose poetry can be also very beautiful but
you must know the technique, you must know

01:33:25.702 --> 01:33:29.622
the way how to put it across.

01:33:29.622 --> 01:33:41.362
Like you may be a great artist as a creative
artist, but you must know how to put technically.

01:33:41.362 --> 01:33:45.902
Supposing I am a great artist but I don’t
know how to handle a brush, how will I do

01:33:45.902 --> 01:33:49.902
it?

01:33:49.902 --> 01:33:54.032
So both things have to be there and that’s
what I think, that because of Sahaja Yoga

01:33:54.032 --> 01:33:57.902
people are getting very creative and they
are feeling the exuberance and they want to

01:33:57.902 --> 01:34:06.672
express themselves but the technique part
of it is lacking, and the subtleties are lacking.

01:34:06.672 --> 01:34:11.402
So whatever poems you are writing is very
good idea, like some of them are very good,

01:34:11.402 --> 01:34:18.482
but still I think there should not be any
crudeness in it, all right?

01:34:18.482 --> 01:34:36.392
So all those who are writing poems, who would
like to write, stand up.

01:34:36.392 --> 01:34:39.372
So nice to see so many poets around.

01:34:39.372 --> 01:34:51.302
All right so now, who will look after?

01:34:51.302 --> 01:34:53.272
You?

01:34:53.272 --> 01:34:57.202
All right.

01:34:57.202 --> 01:35:07.002
You all know them, give your names to him
and send all your poems to him, all right?

01:35:07.002 --> 01:35:10.282
That’s it.

01:35:10.282 --> 01:35:20.332
There should be nothing childish, cheapish
or anything like that.

01:35:20.332 --> 01:35:35.502
Then for art, all those who want to produce
pictures and paintings, drawings, please stand

01:35:35.502 --> 01:35:42.672
up, even the children.

01:35:42.672 --> 01:35:56.992
Chris, you’re going to do that, good, and
your wife too, she’s very good.

01:35:56.992 --> 01:36:02.072
So let’s have Chris there.

01:36:02.072 --> 01:36:11.762
Chris will you be in charge?

01:36:11.762 --> 01:36:16.612
Please be seated.

01:36:16.612 --> 01:36:21.122
So it comes to that we have also two types
of people.

01:36:21.122 --> 01:36:29.282
We have people who are intellectuals - easy
chair Sahaja Yogis - as we have politicians.

01:36:29.282 --> 01:36:31.342
They good at knowledge, scholarship.

01:36:31.342 --> 01:36:33.532
They know about Sahaja Yoga.

01:36:33.532 --> 01:36:35.092
They write well.

01:36:35.092 --> 01:36:46.732
But there are others who are active, very
active, the young, extremely active, they

01:36:46.732 --> 01:36:49.192
can work hard, they can do anything.

01:36:49.192 --> 01:37:05.652
That’s a very good thing, but I think we
should try to imbibe one quality that is lacking

01:37:05.652 --> 01:37:08.042
in us.

01:37:08.042 --> 01:37:15.592
Like a person who is an intellectual, or a
person who is a scholar, should try to do

01:37:15.592 --> 01:37:20.992
other things also, like postering now.

01:37:20.992 --> 01:37:26.402
So for postering they will not go, those who
are intellectuals.

01:37:26.402 --> 01:37:28.892
That’s not good.

01:37:28.892 --> 01:37:30.522
Or anything like that.

01:37:30.522 --> 01:37:38.062
Those who are painting, they’ll paint but
not poster it, or they would not like to write

01:37:38.062 --> 01:37:39.062
the addresses.

01:37:39.062 --> 01:37:41.752
We should be able to do everything because
we are integrated personalities.

01:37:41.752 --> 01:37:47.782
I mean I can give lectures, I can cook food
and I can wash utensils and I can clean My

01:37:47.782 --> 01:37:48.782
house.

01:37:48.782 --> 01:37:51.442
I can wash your clothes and whatever you say.

01:37:51.442 --> 01:37:59.002
Perhaps may be something I may not be able
to do I should say, many things.

01:37:59.002 --> 01:38:00.772
I tell you so many things I can’t do.

01:38:00.772 --> 01:38:03.242
You don’t know My weaknesses, there are
lots of things.

01:38:03.242 --> 01:38:11.522
I’m very bad at signing checks, useless
for banks.

01:38:11.522 --> 01:38:18.692
Always the banks put Me into trouble, I don’t
know what they’re up to, and thank God Gavin

01:38:18.692 --> 01:38:20.772
is quite aware of My weaknesses.

01:38:20.772 --> 01:38:28.812
So looks after that part otherwise I would
be sunk, bad at money.

01:38:28.812 --> 01:38:34.853
Very good at remembering if somebody has taken
money from Me, but if I have given something

01:38:34.853 --> 01:38:38.452
to someone I don’t remember, very bad.

01:38:38.452 --> 01:38:44.002
I give something to someone and then I don’t
remember I’ve given it and I appreciate

01:38:44.002 --> 01:38:45.692
it, it’s very bad too.

01:38:45.692 --> 01:38:47.392
I do it very often.

01:38:47.392 --> 01:38:51.602
I’m so frightened now I don’t want to
praise anything because mostly it is given

01:38:51.602 --> 01:38:52.602
by Me - it’s horrid.

01:38:52.602 --> 01:39:01.362
It looks very funny isn’t it?

01:39:01.362 --> 01:39:06.072
That’s one side missing completely in Me.

01:39:06.072 --> 01:39:13.342
I’m very bad at say passports and things
like that and … what?

01:39:13.342 --> 01:39:22.912
Also, I don’t know about ticketing, all
these things I’m very bad at all these things,

01:39:22.912 --> 01:39:23.912
you see.

01:39:23.912 --> 01:39:28.992
So that’s how you look after Me in that
part, is really I just don’t know.

01:39:28.992 --> 01:39:33.112
I’m very bad at time, now I don’t know
what’s the time now.

01:39:33.112 --> 01:39:37.742
Very bad at watch, it’s always upside down.

01:39:37.742 --> 01:39:50.862
But there’s one thing good, that I know
Myself very well, and I know how to laugh

01:39:50.862 --> 01:40:00.652
at Myself, so I never feel guilty, I know
how to laugh at Myself.

01:40:00.652 --> 01:40:02.742
I can’t learn now, these things.

01:40:02.742 --> 01:40:07.892
I’ve learnt lots of human things but now
I can’t learn how to sign a check, where

01:40:07.892 --> 01:40:10.482
to sign, what to sign, I’m very bad.

01:40:10.482 --> 01:40:13.312
You can get signature on My death warrant
also.

01:40:13.312 --> 01:40:17.282
See I’m like that, I don’t know I just
sign I trust and works out.

01:40:17.282 --> 01:40:22.832
So far nothing has gone wrong as such, much,
but this is what it is.

01:40:22.832 --> 01:40:28.872
So doesn’t matter, one can manage.

01:40:28.872 --> 01:40:33.892
And that is how one should look at oneself
- not to feel guilty but some things are missing.

01:40:33.892 --> 01:40:41.752
But if you can acquire, other qualities also,
will be a good idea.

01:40:41.752 --> 01:40:49.312
And that’s what I think should be the attitude
towards Sahaja Yoga, that no work is below

01:40:49.312 --> 01:40:50.312
our dignity.

01:40:50.312 --> 01:40:54.872
For some people have such ego, “Oh I’m
coming there why not I have a room?”

01:40:54.872 --> 01:40:58.324
Such stupid people have nothing to do with
Sahaja Yoga, I tell you.

01:40:58.324 --> 01:41:01.792
“I must have a special room, why shouldn’t
I have this?”

01:41:01.792 --> 01:41:08.563
This is absolute sign of a stupid fellow,
is absolutely a sign of a person who has never

01:41:08.563 --> 01:41:17.922
known what is comfort, never known what is
money, never known what is luxury.

01:41:17.922 --> 01:41:25.092
Is something cheapish like a beggar who just
starts demanding, “Give me five shillings,”

01:41:25.092 --> 01:41:30.512
then he asks for one hundred shillings and
this and that.

01:41:30.512 --> 01:41:34.942
All these things - the one who asks for things,
is not a king.

01:41:34.942 --> 01:41:47.352
The one who accepts whatever comes their way
is the real king because he’s mastered it.

01:41:47.352 --> 01:41:49.672
This is what is the right attitude.

01:41:49.672 --> 01:41:52.532
That’s what a Sahaja Yogi has to be.

01:41:52.532 --> 01:42:01.532
Who goes on grudging, grumbling about small,
small things is not a Sahaja Yogi.

01:42:01.532 --> 01:42:55.752
Sahaja Yogi is a king, he gives, gives Realization,
the utmost, the highest, all right?

01:42:55.752 --> 01:42:58.282
What’s it?

01:42:58.282 --> 01:43:14.702
[Shri Mataji speaks with an Indian yogini
in Marathi - UNKNOWN MARATHI WORDS] She’s

01:43:14.702 --> 01:43:17.782
giving a very subtle point about puja.

01:43:17.782 --> 01:43:23.472
That when we are doing the puja, say of the
photograph also, then we should have all these

01:43:23.472 --> 01:43:29.182
things like a kalasha and all those things
there, we should not just do the puja of the

01:43:29.182 --> 01:43:30.182
thing - pratibha.

01:43:30.182 --> 01:43:31.182
So I’ve said.

01:43:31.182 --> 01:43:33.002
“You’ve come here all the way over here
to tell them these things they don’t know.”

01:43:33.002 --> 01:43:39.192
So all you see the deepam and all these things
should be there properly done, for the photograph

01:43:39.192 --> 01:43:40.222
also, that’s in the protocol.

01:43:40.222 --> 01:43:45.582
So certain things of protocol - now Gavin
is becoming a big pundit you know.

01:43:45.582 --> 01:43:50.912
He’s getting a scholarship in puja business.

01:43:50.912 --> 01:43:52.092
So you better talk to Gavin, those who have
problems about puja, better ask Gavin.

01:43:52.092 --> 01:43:57.762
Yogi: Mother I was going to ask those who
know something about Puja should come and

01:43:57.762 --> 01:43:59.512
tell me.

01:43:59.512 --> 01:44:05.112
Shri Mataji: All right some of you should…
they have to tell something you better go

01:44:05.112 --> 01:44:07.382
and tell him also.

01:44:07.382 --> 01:44:09.262
Yes, good idea.

01:44:09.262 --> 01:44:11.722
Chhaaya has not come today?

01:44:11.722 --> 01:44:12.952
No.

01:44:12.952 --> 01:44:16.732
She has told lot, then we have got… now
she has come.

01:44:16.732 --> 01:44:22.672
Shakuntala is here then we have got this lady,
we have so many who can tell you about this

01:44:22.672 --> 01:44:26.142
and you can work it out.

01:44:26.142 --> 01:44:28.042
That’s good.

01:44:28.042 --> 01:44:38.152
So scholarship of puja that should be, and
those who want to do puja now, stand up.

01:44:38.152 --> 01:44:42.262
That’s too much.

01:44:42.262 --> 01:44:46.162
To know about puja, all right?

01:44:46.162 --> 01:44:47.492
Good idea.

01:44:47.492 --> 01:44:53.042
You ask Gavin, we should really have about
different marriages, how we perform, what

01:44:53.042 --> 01:44:56.972
are the mantras, what does it mean.

01:44:56.972 --> 01:45:01.572
All those things I think we should really
compile a book on that, good idea.

01:45:01.572 --> 01:45:04.652
All of you should support.

01:45:04.652 --> 01:45:07.652
Give your ideas, all right.

01:45:07.652 --> 01:45:08.652
Thank you.

01:45:08.652 --> 01:45:11.492
I mean in the sense you ask a question, “What
should be done?

01:45:11.492 --> 01:45:12.722
What is to be done?

01:45:12.722 --> 01:45:13.782
What is good?”

01:45:13.782 --> 01:45:17.442
So that he works on that and we find out a
common point.

01:45:17.442 --> 01:45:18.452
All right.

01:45:18.452 --> 01:45:21.282
May God bless you.

01:45:21.282 --> 01:45:26.572
Sit down, sit down.

01:45:26.572 --> 01:45:27.572
Any other aspect.

01:45:27.572 --> 01:45:28.572
Yes?

01:45:28.572 --> 01:45:35.132
Yogi: Shri Mataji, I was wondering what was
going to happening about building work in

01:45:35.132 --> 01:45:38.992
Sahaja Yoga, sometime ago we discussed Golden
Builders.

01:45:38.992 --> 01:45:46.492
Shri Mataji: You have, you are a registered
society, aren’t you?

01:45:46.492 --> 01:45:52.142
Have you registered yourself as Golden Builders?

01:45:52.142 --> 01:46:01.162
All right, all those who are interested in
buildings and decoration and maintenance,

01:46:01.162 --> 01:46:02.162
please stand up.

01:46:02.162 --> 01:46:05.322
Vicky, what do you build?

01:46:05.322 --> 01:46:14.542
Yogi: Mother, the decoration side, if that’s
suitable and can be integrated into the building,

01:46:14.542 --> 01:46:18.612
the decoration side…

01:46:18.612 --> 01:46:29.182
Shri Mataji: Really, then better give your
names to Vicky, all of you.

01:46:29.182 --> 01:46:35.562
Let’s have it because, you see, also I tell
you John, I gave him a good advice to John.

01:46:35.562 --> 01:46:41.412
I told him, “Take photographs of My house
and use it for advertising for saying that

01:46:41.412 --> 01:46:42.992
this is the house we have done.

01:46:42.992 --> 01:46:44.352
This is what we have done.”

01:46:44.352 --> 01:46:49.142
For example, you can do it by showing your
film the way that I have taken the photograph.

01:46:49.142 --> 01:46:56.872
I mean I have done this, all that you see,
and can use it as an advertising thing.

01:46:56.872 --> 01:47:06.412
So that’s how you can carry album and say
that we are working with Golden Builders.

01:47:06.412 --> 01:47:16.552
Yogi: One other area Shri Mataji, music.

01:47:16.552 --> 01:47:22.352
Shri Mataji: All right.

01:47:22.352 --> 01:47:25.212
For music please stand up.

01:47:25.212 --> 01:47:34.892
We don’t have Banam here.

01:47:34.892 --> 01:47:37.612
Is he here?

01:47:37.612 --> 01:47:41.522
Yogi: Yes, Mother.

01:47:41.522 --> 01:47:46.732
Shri Mataji: All right.

01:47:46.732 --> 01:47:51.722
Because I have already asked him to do one
thing.

01:47:51.722 --> 01:47:59.402
So will you look after, all right?

01:47:59.402 --> 01:48:04.872
Can you all contact him?

01:48:04.872 --> 01:48:12.412
Whatever is to be done about music, all right?

01:48:12.412 --> 01:48:14.332
Please be seated.

01:48:14.332 --> 01:48:19.992
Now there’s one another aspect is photography.

01:48:19.992 --> 01:48:27.772
Photos, is should not be all filed.

01:48:27.772 --> 01:48:29.742
Remember what we have done.

01:48:29.742 --> 01:48:34.502
Gavin you have to get all the names of the
people who have… you should give to your

01:48:34.502 --> 01:48:36.032
leaders all right all of you.

01:48:36.032 --> 01:48:40.972
Whatever you have said it, without hesitation
I would like to see.

01:48:40.972 --> 01:48:49.722
Now photography – those who take photographs
stand up.

01:48:49.722 --> 01:48:57.492
No, more.

01:48:57.492 --> 01:48:59.972
More people for photographs.

01:48:59.972 --> 01:49:08.722
Many more.

01:49:08.722 --> 01:49:09.902
Those who have…what are you saying?

01:49:09.902 --> 01:49:15.942
Yogi: Those who have taken nice photographs
of Mother, I thought they would stand up.

01:49:15.942 --> 01:49:19.302
Shri Mataji: Some of them?

01:49:19.302 --> 01:49:23.982
All right.

01:49:23.982 --> 01:49:28.002
Where is Don?

01:49:28.002 --> 01:49:37.442
Yogi: He is making tea, Shri Mataji.

01:49:37.442 --> 01:49:41.642
Shri Mataji: He is making what?

01:49:41.642 --> 01:49:42.642
Yogi: Tea.

01:49:42.642 --> 01:49:43.642
Shri Mataji: So, all right.

01:49:43.642 --> 01:49:45.862
So Don … Harris will look after that.

01:49:45.862 --> 01:49:49.322
Ray.

01:49:49.322 --> 01:49:50.552
You all should contact Ray.

01:49:50.552 --> 01:49:55.712
Give him your names.

01:49:55.712 --> 01:50:05.052
All right?

01:50:05.052 --> 01:50:09.912
Legal side is very important.

01:50:09.912 --> 01:50:20.522
So lawyers and administrators, just stand
up.

01:50:20.522 --> 01:50:25.462
No we have here, what about you?

01:50:25.462 --> 01:50:28.352
You are a Custom Officer isn’t it?

01:50:28.352 --> 01:50:33.052
Better stand up.

01:50:33.052 --> 01:50:47.982
Anybody police officer, those who are dealing
with government?

01:50:47.982 --> 01:50:54.082
Yes, good.

01:50:54.082 --> 01:50:55.082
All right, you look after that.

01:50:55.082 --> 01:50:56.082
Good.

01:50:56.082 --> 01:50:57.082
You know him or not?

01:50:57.082 --> 01:50:58.082
All right.

01:50:58.082 --> 01:50:59.082
Yogi: Mother may I ask you one thing about
the important side of perhaps purchasing property

01:50:59.082 --> 01:51:00.082
through Sahaja Yoga and maybe the benefits
that could be obtained through use of the

01:51:00.082 --> 01:51:01.082
charity.

01:51:01.082 --> 01:51:02.082
We don’t have any knowledge about it at
the moment, but in Birmingham at the moment,

01:51:02.082 --> 01:51:03.082
we have made some inquiries and now Ray from
Derby, he deals with the legal side of many

01:51:03.082 --> 01:51:04.082
things connected with local government…

01:51:04.082 --> 01:51:05.082
Shri Mataji: Can you stand up.

01:51:05.082 --> 01:51:06.082
Yogi: …and he’s been most helpful in sorting
out our details referring to mortgages and

01:51:06.082 --> 01:51:23.232
so on for us and has come up with certain
information.

01:51:23.232 --> 01:51:33.982
But also we’re anxious to know what benefits
may be accrued by Sahaja Yogis if we can use

01:51:33.982 --> 01:51:36.672
a charity to do such things.

01:51:36.672 --> 01:51:56.552
It seems that there may be some financial
benefits here and if we can get together some

01:51:56.552 --> 01:51:57.552
information.

01:51:57.552 --> 01:51:59.932
Shri Mataji: All right.

01:51:59.932 --> 01:52:03.992
For this part I would say David Prall.

01:52:03.992 --> 01:52:05.012
Where is he?

01:52:05.012 --> 01:52:06.012
Stand up.

01:52:06.012 --> 01:52:12.312
Those who are interested, buying properties
and charitable things and all that, who are

01:52:12.312 --> 01:52:13.312
interested?

01:52:13.312 --> 01:52:15.312
Just get up.

01:52:15.312 --> 01:52:22.012
Where is Ian?

01:52:22.012 --> 01:52:37.402
Yogi: Mother we have got some details about
the covenant thing from our accountant…

01:52:37.402 --> 01:52:38.662
Shri Mataji: What, details about?

01:52:38.662 --> 01:52:39.932
Yogi: Getting money on covenant.

01:52:39.932 --> 01:52:41.452
It’s very much beneficial, tax benefits…

01:52:41.452 --> 01:52:42.472
Shri Mataji: All right.

01:52:42.472 --> 01:52:49.392
So David Prall is to be informed about whatever
information you get, and to get from him all

01:52:49.392 --> 01:52:58.632
the information that is needed, and through
him we’ll deal in property problems.

01:52:58.632 --> 01:52:59.632
All right?

01:52:59.632 --> 01:53:06.512
So let us have a collective thing, all of
you should give your names to him, and everyone

01:53:06.512 --> 01:53:12.282
who is now appointed as the person in charge
should give us a full idea.

01:53:12.282 --> 01:53:17.512
Any problem with your properties should go
to this committee.

01:53:17.512 --> 01:53:19.872
All right?

01:53:19.872 --> 01:53:31.372
Now, there’s one more aspect which is the
most important and the greatest headache,

01:53:31.372 --> 01:53:39.842
is marriages.

01:53:39.842 --> 01:53:58.092
So this has to be somebody international and…You
are in that photograph group, all right?

01:53:58.092 --> 01:54:01.702
Who is in charge of photographs, Ray Harris.

01:54:01.702 --> 01:54:02.742
All right?

01:54:02.742 --> 01:54:04.232
You contact him.

01:54:04.232 --> 01:54:10.712
Now make something positive, some plans positive,
make it something, let Me know.

01:54:10.712 --> 01:54:15.182
There are photographs and photographs and
you don’t know where they are compiled,

01:54:15.182 --> 01:54:18.172
who has taken them, where are the copies – nothing.

01:54:18.172 --> 01:54:22.442
It’s all just, everywhere, all right?

01:54:22.442 --> 01:54:28.322
So proper filing has to be done, proper understanding
has to be done.

01:54:28.322 --> 01:54:49.912
For marriages Warren is the best I think.

01:54:49.912 --> 01:54:58.972
Now Warren you should stand up and now those
who want to help in making marriages successful,

01:54:58.972 --> 01:55:05.282
in the sense in advising people, in making
them understand, talking to them, and also

01:55:05.282 --> 01:55:13.292
organizing marriages, future marriages, of
people – like a marriage bureau – those

01:55:13.292 --> 01:55:15.572
who would like to help.

01:55:15.572 --> 01:55:18.282
Some elderly people should come out for this.

01:55:18.282 --> 01:55:23.182
I would like to have.

01:55:23.182 --> 01:55:24.182
What do you think Manta?

01:55:24.182 --> 01:55:29.362
You not stood for anything, come along.

01:55:29.362 --> 01:55:32.432
Pat, where’s Pat?

01:55:32.432 --> 01:55:34.492
Who else?

01:55:34.492 --> 01:55:40.122
They should be happily married people, in
a way.

01:55:40.122 --> 01:55:45.782
Yes, good, Sarah.

01:55:45.782 --> 01:55:49.552
Yes, good.

01:55:49.552 --> 01:55:52.492
There are outside also.

01:55:52.492 --> 01:55:54.072
That’s for children.

01:55:54.072 --> 01:55:55.072
They will be for children.

01:55:55.072 --> 01:55:57.872
Those who are outside will be for children.

01:55:57.872 --> 01:56:06.972
All right, so here they are, now please send
your names to him today.

01:56:06.972 --> 01:56:12.172
All these names must be given today, in this
seminar, all right?

01:56:12.172 --> 01:56:20.532
Now for children, last and the most important.

01:56:20.532 --> 01:56:31.602
Call them.

01:56:31.602 --> 01:56:33.752
You are a teacher, isn’t it?

01:56:33.752 --> 01:56:45.552
You are teaching in a school.

01:56:45.552 --> 01:56:53.262
But just now we are thinking of starting a
school in Hounslow.

01:56:53.262 --> 01:56:55.672
But where do you live?

01:56:55.672 --> 01:57:03.012
It’s too far away.

01:57:03.012 --> 01:57:06.682
All right.

01:57:06.682 --> 01:57:17.282
Now how many of you who have children, small
children, and interested in them?

01:57:17.282 --> 01:57:18.992
Let’s see.

01:57:18.992 --> 01:57:21.542
Now get up.

01:57:21.542 --> 01:57:34.352
All those parents who have small children,
all those parents who have very small children.

01:57:34.352 --> 01:57:52.822
Get him please, get him.

01:57:52.822 --> 01:57:55.072
I think David is the best for this.

01:57:55.072 --> 01:57:57.472
David will you take over?

01:57:57.472 --> 01:57:58.912
Let David handle.

01:57:58.912 --> 01:58:06.642
All of you should contact David about it.

01:58:06.642 --> 01:58:14.872
Now all of you should sit down and only David
should stand so they should know.

01:58:14.872 --> 01:58:22.432
You’ll have to also deal with problem children.

01:58:22.432 --> 01:58:24.462
There are problem children.

01:58:24.462 --> 01:58:34.582
Now we have to find out something where we
can deal with problem children.

01:58:34.582 --> 01:58:37.782
And about that I’ll talk to you.

01:58:37.782 --> 01:58:42.052
Those who have problem children, please get
up.

01:58:42.052 --> 01:58:51.092
She’s better, much better now.

01:58:51.092 --> 01:58:52.732
But what about you?

01:58:52.732 --> 01:58:59.702
[Question from a yogi: is deafness a problem?]

01:58:59.702 --> 01:59:06.082
In a way, in a way it is, because it is to
be treated, all right?

01:59:06.082 --> 01:59:12.162
So, those who have problem children, also
must be dealt with.

01:59:12.162 --> 01:59:18.402
So you can have two things: where there are
problem children and where there are not.

01:59:18.402 --> 01:59:24.682
If they are catching, if they are still not
enjoying life, if they have little problems

01:59:24.682 --> 01:59:33.402
with them, or if they are catching from parents,
all these things are to be dealt with.

01:59:33.402 --> 01:59:42.552
So on this point I have to say one thing,
when we have problem children is sometimes

01:59:42.552 --> 01:59:48.512
the fault of the parents also or may be some
defect in them, or some sort of a wrong thing.

01:59:48.512 --> 01:59:56.122
Now under these circumstances, we have to
understand that it is the right approach of

01:59:56.122 --> 02:00:00.072
the parents can only help the children to
get all right.

02:00:00.072 --> 02:00:04.952
So whatever is suggested to them and told
to them, they are not to feel bad about it,

02:00:04.952 --> 02:00:09.222
but to accept it and correct their ways and
methods and things will work out.

02:00:09.222 --> 02:00:10.702
All right, so that’s a promise.

02:00:10.702 --> 02:00:13.092
Nobody’s going to feel bad about it.

02:00:13.092 --> 02:00:18.472
Is going to take it up as a very good advice,
whatever we have to tell them, so because

02:00:18.472 --> 02:00:21.622
we have to pay special attention to this.

02:00:21.622 --> 02:00:25.772
Specially with ladies I have seen if you tell
them anything, they start crying.

02:00:25.772 --> 02:00:29.412
It’s a water power which I cannot overcome.

02:00:29.412 --> 02:00:33.353
I don’t cry so much do I?

02:00:33.353 --> 02:00:39.862
I don’t know why people should cry so much
and upset everybody.

02:00:39.862 --> 02:00:42.802
So such people will not be allowed to cry.

02:00:42.802 --> 02:00:48.592
If they are to correct their children, first
thing they are not to cry and weep and sulk.

02:00:48.592 --> 02:00:51.522
Then only we can solve the problem, all right?

02:00:51.522 --> 02:00:52.522
So, done.

02:00:52.522 --> 02:00:53.522
This is also done.

02:00:53.522 --> 02:00:59.782
All right, let the children go out.

02:00:59.782 --> 02:01:02.382
Because the children still are not peaceful.

02:01:02.382 --> 02:01:03.552
We can see that.

02:01:03.552 --> 02:01:04.732
They are very noisy.

02:01:04.732 --> 02:01:09.102
They are not normal, so you can take the children
out.

02:01:09.102 --> 02:01:29.992
I think most of them are problem children,
because they cannot feel the vibrations.

02:01:29.992 --> 02:01:31.232
You could feel, you see.

02:01:31.232 --> 02:01:34.712
Did you feel that when they came in, the heaviness?

02:01:34.712 --> 02:01:39.242
It was very sad.

02:01:39.242 --> 02:01:45.302
Those who were supposed to do great jobs are
sick now.

02:01:45.302 --> 02:01:57.802
That’s because of the parents.

02:01:57.802 --> 02:02:08.202
I think now I can go or what’s the next
program?

02:02:08.202 --> 02:02:31.062
Yogi: Mother this evening we wanted to sing
something for You, some books.

02:02:31.062 --> 02:02:38.092
Shri Mataji: What’s that?

02:02:38.092 --> 02:02:42.412
Can you hand it over to Me.

02:02:42.412 --> 02:02:48.432
What a very sweet thing you…what a sweet
thing.

02:02:48.432 --> 02:02:49.432
Thank you.

02:02:49.432 --> 02:02:50.432
Lunch?

02:02:50.432 --> 02:02:51.432
I don’t know.

02:02:51.432 --> 02:02:52.432
Am I supposed to eat lunch?

02:02:52.432 --> 02:02:55.752
That’s another thing you see.

02:02:55.752 --> 02:03:07.872
I have not had lunch so far, I think so, you
know.

02:03:07.872 --> 02:03:15.032
So what song Gavin?

02:03:15.032 --> 02:03:28.732
Why not have I’m Your Rakhi Brother?

02:03:28.732 --> 02:03:47.232
Yogi: There’s quite a big job to be done
on taping…big job to be done on getting

02:03:47.232 --> 02:03:50.322
all Your tapes transferred onto permanent
tapes.

02:03:50.322 --> 02:03:56.902
Did You want to appoint somebody to help Germail
with that?

02:03:56.902 --> 02:03:57.902
Shri Mataji: Where is Germail?

02:03:57.902 --> 02:04:01.652
I didn’t see him.

02:04:01.652 --> 02:04:06.372
Yogi: He’s coming in the afternoon.

02:04:06.372 --> 02:04:12.662
We need people who are technically well who
are able to spare time each week to copy many

02:04:12.662 --> 02:04:13.662
of Your old tapes.

02:04:13.662 --> 02:04:27.552
Shri Mataji: Those who want to copy My old
tapes and help, please stand up who know technical

02:04:27.552 --> 02:04:34.422
ways of doing it.

02:04:34.422 --> 02:04:38.472
But we have only one machine.

02:04:38.472 --> 02:04:46.922
Can we buy another?

02:04:46.922 --> 02:04:51.352
Yogi: The machinery is adequate, Mother.

02:04:51.352 --> 02:04:53.302
They’ve got enough machinery now.

02:04:53.302 --> 02:04:54.662
Shri Mataji: Only one.

02:04:54.662 --> 02:04:57.372
Yogi: Germail is well set up for copying.

02:04:57.372 --> 02:04:59.132
It’s the people we need.

02:04:59.132 --> 02:05:03.502
Shri Mataji: You have to come, distribute
among yourselves and [MARATHI] and there’s

02:05:03.502 --> 02:05:05.512
no Hindi speaking people here?

02:05:05.512 --> 02:05:07.622
Chhaya can do Hindi.

02:05:07.622 --> 02:05:12.922
They can go there to the ashram and do it.

02:05:12.922 --> 02:05:20.802
[MARATHI] So Ian is not going to be here permanently
but Germail.

02:05:20.802 --> 02:05:26.072
You must contact Germail, offer your services
to him and tell him that you would like to

02:05:26.072 --> 02:05:27.072
do that.

02:05:27.072 --> 02:05:28.792
How many there are, who can spare?

02:05:28.792 --> 02:05:30.112
Derek you got up also.

02:05:30.112 --> 02:05:32.182
Can you come to the ashram sometimes?

02:05:32.182 --> 02:05:36.822
Yogi: I’ve got copying facilities in Cambridge,
Mother.

02:05:36.822 --> 02:05:44.952
They send me single tapes and I copy twenty
or forty at a time.

02:05:44.952 --> 02:05:47.272
Shri Mataji: All right.

02:05:47.272 --> 02:05:48.272
Some people who can spare a day.

02:05:48.272 --> 02:05:49.272
Yogi: One day each week.

02:05:49.272 --> 02:06:00.812
Come on, there should be a lot of people who
can do it, in London, at Chelsham Road.

02:06:00.812 --> 02:06:06.602
Shri Mataji: Will you give your names to Germail?

02:06:06.602 --> 02:06:07.702
Some more people should come round.

02:06:07.702 --> 02:06:08.842
It’s a tremendous task, you see.

02:06:08.842 --> 02:06:09.842
Yogi: All go back to 1974.

02:06:09.842 --> 02:06:10.842
They are all deteriorating and Mother’s
tapes are going to be lost if we don’t do

02:06:10.842 --> 02:06:11.842
it quickly.

02:06:11.842 --> 02:06:17.342
We also need to spend money on a digital recorder
to make it permanent.

02:06:17.342 --> 02:06:23.792
Shri Mataji: That’s good.

02:06:23.792 --> 02:06:41.472
It’s very important.

02:06:41.472 --> 02:06:47.352
Children are in a bad shape Left Nahbi is
catching.

02:06:47.352 --> 02:06:56.202
Wrong with, something wrong with the mothers.

02:06:56.202 --> 02:06:57.822
What is it?

02:06:57.822 --> 02:07:06.782
Now what I’m saying, this is to be done
when I am gone, all of you, should give your

02:07:06.782 --> 02:07:09.092
names to…remember, I hope you remember.

02:07:09.092 --> 02:07:13.882
Because you stood up and sat down, stood up
and sat down, but now remember when you stood

02:07:13.882 --> 02:07:15.772
up, you see.

02:07:15.772 --> 02:07:17.672
One may forget.

02:07:17.672 --> 02:07:27.792
Yogi: He’s saying that there must be some
people who would be prepared to write articles

02:07:27.792 --> 02:07:45.182
about Sahaja Yoga for publication in the magazines
and newspapers, and we should make an effort

02:07:45.182 --> 02:07:47.972
on that line.

02:07:47.972 --> 02:07:48.972
Shri Mataji: Yes.

02:07:48.972 --> 02:07:49.972
That’s one side of it.

02:07:49.972 --> 02:07:56.052
Newspaper cuttings and things now, I was thinking
of John Noyce if he’s here, I don’t know.

02:07:56.052 --> 02:07:57.052
Are you?

02:07:57.052 --> 02:08:00.422
He’s the one who should be in charge of
that, John Noyce.

02:08:00.422 --> 02:08:01.712
Will you stand up?

02:08:01.712 --> 02:08:04.872
Now will you stand up all those who want to
do that?

02:08:04.872 --> 02:08:16.492
Is compiling of all newspaper cuttings, from
all over the world, compiling all articles

02:08:16.492 --> 02:08:19.232
which are to be published.

02:08:19.232 --> 02:08:24.912
You mean to say in the magazines?

02:08:24.912 --> 02:08:36.592
What did he say?

02:08:36.592 --> 02:08:45.782
Yogi: He’s saying that people should start
writing now, for publication and that it should

02:08:45.782 --> 02:08:46.782
all be edited and sent in.

02:08:46.782 --> 02:08:47.782
Shri Mataji: Yes.

02:08:47.782 --> 02:08:48.782
That’s it.

02:08:48.782 --> 02:08:53.492
But also we have newspaper cuttings everywhere
which are to be put into one file and to be

02:08:53.492 --> 02:08:54.512
studied and marked.

02:08:54.512 --> 02:08:59.892
Yogi: That’s one job which is very good
for John to do.

02:08:59.892 --> 02:09:02.122
He’s very good at that.

02:09:02.122 --> 02:09:04.362
Another team with David perhaps.

02:09:04.362 --> 02:09:05.712
Shri Mataji: Now.

02:09:05.712 --> 02:09:11.472
For David is for property and all that we’ve
given him one job, is sufficient to kill him

02:09:11.472 --> 02:09:12.512
with one job.

02:09:12.512 --> 02:09:17.532
But you can join him in this, I mean in the
sense you can belong to that party as well.

02:09:17.532 --> 02:09:23.412
So now those who want to compile all that
is interviewed, all the newspapers, every

02:09:23.412 --> 02:09:29.052
cutting and also your own contributions, please
stand up.

02:09:29.052 --> 02:09:33.622
This is not only writing, but compiling.

02:09:33.622 --> 02:09:34.742
That’s good.

02:09:34.742 --> 02:09:36.242
Valerie is good.

02:09:36.242 --> 02:09:48.702
For example also we can say what we can do,
how to have our pamphlets and brochures and

02:09:48.702 --> 02:09:50.932
these are to be done up to that point.

02:09:50.932 --> 02:09:52.252
All right?

02:09:52.252 --> 02:09:53.562
That’s one.

02:09:53.562 --> 02:09:58.302
So we come to another very delicate thing
is contacts.

02:09:58.302 --> 02:09:59.682
Now so?

02:09:59.682 --> 02:10:01.852
That’s it.

02:10:01.852 --> 02:10:10.782
Contacts with the television, and other publicity
things.

02:10:10.782 --> 02:10:18.162
Now whatever is our own publicity should be
done by John Noyce but to contact others and

02:10:18.162 --> 02:10:19.162
all that.

02:10:19.162 --> 02:10:20.162
Valerie?

02:10:20.162 --> 02:10:22.212
Yogi: What about John Glover, Mother?

02:10:22.212 --> 02:10:26.132
Shri Mataji: Oh, where is John Glover?

02:10:26.132 --> 02:10:31.422
No that’s for something else.

02:10:31.422 --> 02:10:34.232
But I was thinking Valerie is better for this.

02:10:34.232 --> 02:10:35.232
Will you take over?

02:10:35.232 --> 02:10:36.552
Please stand up.

02:10:36.552 --> 02:10:44.562
Now those who want to go to the programs,
if we arrange some sort of a drama, something

02:10:44.562 --> 02:10:56.992
or we arrange anything related to the - for
the television or publicity anywhere else

02:10:56.992 --> 02:11:05.162
outside, through other agencies, please stand
up.

02:11:05.162 --> 02:11:11.122
Good.

02:11:11.122 --> 02:11:13.562
Bogdan and John Noyce.

02:11:13.562 --> 02:11:18.252
I didn’t see Bogdan, where is he?

02:11:18.252 --> 02:11:20.322
All right.

02:11:20.322 --> 02:11:25.932
So you be one of the parties with them, but
leader is Valerie.

02:11:25.932 --> 02:11:27.812
All right?

02:11:27.812 --> 02:11:33.482
Please be seated.

02:11:33.482 --> 02:11:38.312
But remember that you have promised all these
things in My presence.

02:11:38.312 --> 02:11:42.992
Practically we have covered lots of things.

02:11:42.992 --> 02:11:44.962
Let’s see how much we achieve.

02:11:44.962 --> 02:11:49.372
So Paul what are you in charge?

02:11:49.372 --> 02:11:50.372
Computerization of everything.

02:11:50.372 --> 02:11:52.042
Yogi: Not at the moment, Mother.

02:11:52.042 --> 02:11:55.652
Shri Mataji: All right.

02:11:55.652 --> 02:11:57.072
You stand up for that.

02:11:57.072 --> 02:11:58.072
Now here is Paul.

02:11:58.072 --> 02:12:03.002
Yogi: I’m pleased to say, Mother, that the
equipment we make is selling very well in

02:12:03.002 --> 02:12:04.152
India.

02:12:04.152 --> 02:12:13.322
We’re selling Marathi, Gujrati, Bengali,
Tamil systems, everything.

02:12:13.322 --> 02:12:23.482
Shri Mataji: So all that sort of typing, of
computerizing, Paul is in charge.

02:12:23.482 --> 02:12:25.512
Now those who want to help him in that, who
are good at computerizing, giving ideas on

02:12:25.512 --> 02:12:26.512
that please stand up.

02:12:26.512 --> 02:12:27.512
All right.

02:12:27.512 --> 02:12:28.512
Who else?

02:12:28.512 --> 02:12:29.512
Germail, also Germail.

02:12:29.512 --> 02:12:30.512
Good.

02:12:30.512 --> 02:12:46.142
So now please write down all their names in
one paper.

02:12:46.142 --> 02:12:48.042
That you can tell later.

02:12:48.042 --> 02:12:49.472
All right?

02:12:49.472 --> 02:12:51.912
Brian has done a good job.

02:12:51.912 --> 02:13:03.492
There’s a series of seekers and actually
in one of the programs one boy gets Realization

02:13:03.492 --> 02:13:13.832
in front of My photograph and they show My
photograph on the television.

02:13:13.832 --> 02:13:23.912
But that is in Auckland.

02:13:23.912 --> 02:13:30.262
That is in New Zealand where we have a very
great dynamic Prime Minister.

02:13:30.262 --> 02:13:36.862
I think after Sadat, I feel he is another
person who is a Realized soul.

02:13:36.862 --> 02:13:43.202
I hope the Prime Minister here also gets Realization
or we get somebody who is a Realized soul,

02:13:43.202 --> 02:13:46.662
one of the two.

02:13:46.662 --> 02:13:50.372
I hope she gets it.

02:13:50.372 --> 02:13:59.082
Pray for it.

02:13:59.082 --> 02:14:01.942
So can we go now?

02:14:01.942 --> 02:14:06.762
What’s the lunchtime business?

02:14:06.762 --> 02:14:14.002
Yogi: Lunch is coming, Shri Mataji.

02:14:14.002 --> 02:14:17.622
Shri Mataji: Here?

02:14:17.622 --> 02:14:18.672
And nobody’s going to eat now.

02:14:18.672 --> 02:14:20.222
I’m the only person who is going to eat?

02:14:20.222 --> 02:14:21.542
[Yogi says something inaudible]

02:14:21.542 --> 02:14:23.192
Shri Mataji: All of us.

02:14:23.192 --> 02:14:24.502
Then it’s all right.

02:14:24.502 --> 02:14:26.612
What’s that Gavin?

02:14:26.612 --> 02:14:33.562
[Yogi says something inaudible]

02:14:33.562 --> 02:14:40.512
Shri Mataji: Just … [laughter]

02:14:40.512 --> 02:14:47.472
Thank you very much.

02:14:47.472 --> 02:14:52.682
That’s quite heavy.

02:14:52.682 --> 02:14:56.162
All right.

02:14:56.162 --> 02:15:03.112
May God bless you.

02:15:03.112 --> 02:15:06.002
You can open it and show them.

02:15:06.002 --> 02:15:11.572
That’s what they make here, and I mean there
was no need but they said I have to remember.

02:15:11.572 --> 02:15:21.082
I would in any case remember and but now that’s
their idea, what am I to do?

02:15:21.082 --> 02:15:33.742
Something that they make here.

02:15:33.742 --> 02:15:46.942
That’s it.

02:15:46.942 --> 02:15:53.542
See.

02:15:53.542 --> 02:16:22.602
Oh what a beautiful design.

02:16:22.602 --> 02:16:23.602
Is in Sheffield?

02:16:23.602 --> 02:16:24.972
Yogi: Yes, made in Sheffield.

02:16:24.972 --> 02:16:28.252
Shri Mataji: It’s beautiful design, isn’t
it?

02:16:28.252 --> 02:16:33.682
It’s better than what you showed Me.

02:16:33.682 --> 02:16:36.782
That’s the third one.

02:16:36.782 --> 02:16:39.352
Now we put it here.

02:16:39.352 --> 02:16:43.872
It’s beautiful and this I will see every
day, morning.

02:16:43.872 --> 02:16:45.972
It’s beautiful.

02:16:45.972 --> 02:16:49.332
Very beautiful design I must say.

02:16:49.332 --> 02:17:00.122
You know we copied this in the… we have
got this design, we use it in Calcutta.

02:17:00.122 --> 02:17:02.542
Really.

02:17:02.542 --> 02:17:07.382
Believe Me.

02:17:07.382 --> 02:17:12.222
It’s beautiful.

02:17:12.222 --> 02:17:23.052
What a beauty.

02:17:23.052 --> 02:17:26.362
Four pieces you got.

02:17:26.362 --> 02:17:29.132
It’s beautiful.

02:17:29.132 --> 02:17:33.272
Look at that.

02:17:33.272 --> 02:17:40.192
[applause] Thank you very much.

02:17:40.192 --> 02:17:42.952
Thank you.

02:17:53.550 --> 02:17:58.870
I thank all the Sheffield Sahaja Yogis for
such a beautiful gift and this I will have

02:17:58.870 --> 02:18:00.360
every day.

02:18:00.360 --> 02:18:02.010
Thank you very much.

02:18:02.010 --> 02:18:07.010
May God bless you.

02:18:07.010 --> 02:18:09.690
You better keep it back into the box I think,
properly done.

02:18:09.690 --> 02:18:10.950
It’s beautiful, isn’t it?

02:18:10.950 --> 02:18:12.560
You all can have a look.

02:18:12.560 --> 02:18:13.760
Let them see.

02:18:13.760 --> 02:18:16.810
The design is very nice and delicate.

02:18:16.810 --> 02:18:18.370
Who’s got it?

02:18:18.370 --> 02:18:19.930
Warren, you did.

02:18:19.930 --> 02:18:24.580
Yogi: I got it with [INAUDIBLE] this morning.

02:18:24.580 --> 02:18:26.630
Shri Mataji: Really?

02:18:26.630 --> 02:18:30.040
No this I didn’t see.

02:18:30.040 --> 02:18:35.130
The one I saw was, it has that design you
know.

02:18:35.130 --> 02:18:37.220
That didn’t have any design.

02:18:41.037 --> 02:18:45.126
Yogi: They couldn’t get the one You wanted
so this is the replacement.

02:18:45.230 --> 02:18:47.841
This is cheaper.

02:18:52.530 --> 02:18:54.023
Shri Mataji: Really.

02:18:55.355 --> 02:18:56.355
Sahaj.

02:19:02.399 --> 02:19:04.238
It’s from the same shop.

02:19:08.807 --> 02:19:10.577
It’s such a beautiful thing.

02:19:10.602 --> 02:19:12.612
And also very sensibly-sized you see.

02:19:12.612 --> 02:19:14.992
That one was a jumbo one.

02:19:14.992 --> 02:19:16.012
All right.

02:19:16.012 --> 02:19:19.172
So should we have some music?

02:19:19.172 --> 02:19:25.052
And, Gavin if you want I’ll eat, otherwise
I better go.

02:19:25.052 --> 02:19:30.902
I don’t want to trouble you people because
I had a meal.

02:19:30.902 --> 02:19:34.472
No because … why to bother.

02:19:34.472 --> 02:19:36.262
All right.

02:19:36.262 --> 02:19:40.742
So, let’s have this one.

02:19:40.742 --> 02:19:57.082
But

02:19:57.082 --> 02:19:58.082
what a nice thing.

02:19:58.082 --> 02:20:05.402
I want to see the design.

02:20:05.402 --> 02:20:32.342
[TAPE CONTINUES WITH CONVERSATION AND SINGING
THEN:]

02:20:32.342 --> 02:20:38.922
Shri Mataji: Beautiful.

02:20:38.922 --> 02:20:45.512
Now, your suggestion.

02:20:45.512 --> 02:21:57.432
Can

02:21:57.432 --> 02:22:13.042
you bring it?

02:22:13.042 --> 02:22:28.602
All right.

02:22:28.602 --> 02:23:24.342
Will you please go and get it?

02:23:24.342 --> 02:24:02.712
Yes, yes that’s great.

02:24:02.712 --> 02:24:04.452
Just go.

02:24:04.452 --> 02:24:16.872
Those who have their instruments should go
and get it.

02:24:16.872 --> 02:24:29.242
Pat has come I think.

02:24:29.242 --> 02:24:33.772
He is sitting outside.

02:24:33.772 --> 02:24:37.172
What’s the matter?

02:24:37.172 --> 02:24:39.492
What are you doing there?

02:24:39.492 --> 02:24:45.782
Well, you better join our company.

02:24:45.782 --> 02:25:09.612
Take him in the builders.

02:25:09.612 --> 02:25:40.092
[Marathi] Please get your musical instruments
if they are outside.

02:25:40.092 --> 02:25:46.182
The faces of Sahaja Yogis are so different
you know.

02:25:46.182 --> 02:25:49.152
They look so different.

02:25:49.152 --> 02:25:54.382
Every one is a piece of art I think.

02:25:54.382 --> 02:25:57.812
So beautiful.

02:25:57.812 --> 02:26:02.962
What’s she saying?

02:26:02.962 --> 02:26:12.692
Yogi: There’s a new song written by Diane
from Sheffield.

02:26:12.692 --> 02:26:15.302
Shri Mataji: Really?

02:26:15.302 --> 02:26:16.302
Great.

02:26:16.302 --> 02:26:17.922
Let’s hear.

02:26:17.922 --> 02:26:19.122
Now bring it along.

02:26:19.122 --> 02:26:20.292
Yes why not?

02:26:20.292 --> 02:26:24.042
From Sheffield we should have.

02:26:24.042 --> 02:26:51.521
[MARATHI] She’s written a Marathi poem,
so I’ll translate it to you.

02:26:51.521 --> 02:27:21.052
She says that, “My child who is a Sahaja
Yogi is telling you, is manifesting knowledge.

02:27:21.052 --> 02:27:31.261
I request you, everyone, that’s Me, request
you all of you, that I am the mother of this

02:27:31.261 --> 02:27:36.612
child, and you pay attention to him.”

02:27:36.612 --> 02:27:47.832
This is a typical, you see, a Indian, what
we call a kautuk, is the one where you handle

02:27:47.832 --> 02:27:51.562
the child with fondness.

02:27:51.562 --> 02:27:54.812
You express the fondness for the child.

02:27:54.812 --> 02:28:01.442
Now so she’s describing the fondness for
the child, I have.

02:28:01.442 --> 02:28:07.141
My little child sonu they call it, is the
golden child.

02:28:07.141 --> 02:28:29.481
My golden child speaks with such affection,
sweet, what you say to the child’s talk

02:28:29.481 --> 02:28:34.302
– chattel?

02:28:34.302 --> 02:28:35.592
Is it a good word?

02:28:35.592 --> 02:28:41.172
I mean Sahaja Yogis having chattels.

02:28:41.172 --> 02:28:43.782
We can say the beautiful talk of a child.

02:28:43.782 --> 02:28:46.761
You see child here meaning the innocence.

02:28:46.761 --> 02:28:56.622
He speaks to you with innocence, and listening
to him, I’m saying, to the people, listening

02:28:56.622 --> 02:29:01.302
to him, your attention will enter inside.

02:29:01.302 --> 02:29:06.601
It will leave all that is outside and will
enter inside.

02:29:06.601 --> 02:29:19.321
And
to tell [MARATHI] Nirupan is the explanation

02:29:19.321 --> 02:29:26.021
of the Divine, but is said, it goes with My
word Niru, Niru is My name.

02:29:26.021 --> 02:29:34.641
So it’s a pun on the word Nirupan – pana
means the abstract of Niru.

02:29:34.641 --> 02:29:36.802
To talk about that.

02:29:36.802 --> 02:29:39.492
So there’s a word, Nirupan has double word.

02:29:39.492 --> 02:29:51.721
It also means to explain the abstract of Mother,
and Nirupana also means explanation of Divine.

02:29:51.721 --> 02:30:00.552
“Oh God, give him the blessings, I say.

02:30:00.552 --> 02:30:10.432
He is also in this world living like a ordinary
householder, as well as he has achieved a

02:30:10.432 --> 02:30:12.472
Sahaja samadhi.

02:30:12.472 --> 02:30:22.932
He has achieved the Sahaja, samadhi as you
know is the enlightened awareness.

02:30:22.932 --> 02:30:27.662
But he lives in the world, not given up anything.

02:30:27.662 --> 02:30:44.941
For the people who are ignorant, he has taken
the help of chaitanya.

02:30:44.941 --> 02:30:57.562
He is [MARATHI] It goes beyond English.

02:30:57.562 --> 02:31:02.781
[MARATHI] Let Me try.

02:31:02.781 --> 02:31:13.722
You

02:31:13.722 --> 02:31:24.432
see you go on conquering, one after another
challenge to the ambrosia of Mother’s talks.

02:31:24.432 --> 02:31:31.071
Take Her name and you can do it.

02:31:31.071 --> 02:31:36.691
It’s very poetic.

02:31:36.691 --> 02:32:03.451
[MARATHI] In the eyes there’s light, enlightened,
and with that all the lights get enlightened,

02:32:03.451 --> 02:32:09.521
and the Siddhapurushas, the ones who have
achieved the Siddhata, the ones who are very

02:32:09.521 --> 02:32:19.592
great, higher souls have come on this Earth
now to see Mahayoga.

02:32:19.592 --> 02:32:20.592
They are watching.

02:32:20.592 --> 02:32:29.122
Their spirits are watching this Mahayoga of
the children, of children that are Mine.

02:32:29.122 --> 02:32:30.122
All right?

02:32:30.122 --> 02:32:31.122
It’s about.

02:32:31.122 --> 02:32:33.172
I am not so good now I must say.

02:32:33.172 --> 02:32:34.352
We’ll have to sit down.

02:32:34.352 --> 02:32:36.462
But Marathi language is very, very deep.

02:32:36.462 --> 02:32:42.861
To bring it out is very difficult but I have
tried.

02:32:42.861 --> 02:33:02.771
[MARATHI] Just put it for her little bit.

02:33:02.771 --> 02:33:20.322
[MARATHI - Poet sings in Marathi.]

02:33:20.322 --> 02:33:40.862
Shri Mataji: Now the last bit I just missed
the point.

02:33:40.862 --> 02:35:00.142
[MARATHI] the eyes lit in eyes of my children,
they’re the eyes you see, there’s a twinkle

02:35:00.142 --> 02:35:37.312
in your eye.

02:35:37.312 --> 02:36:08.812
The light lit in your eyes is that of knowledge,
and when it illumines the [MARATHI] What are

02:36:08.812 --> 02:36:12.941
they called?

02:36:12.941 --> 02:36:17.401
What are called clusters of lights in the
Heavens?

02:36:17.401 --> 02:36:21.201
What do you call them?

02:36:21.201 --> 02:36:22.201
Constellations?

02:36:22.201 --> 02:36:25.002
Yes, yes, constellations, yes.

02:36:25.002 --> 02:36:35.331
And when these lights are enlightened the
constellations, as the great evolved souls

02:36:35.331 --> 02:36:43.161
have come on this earth as constellations
because the twinkle in the eyes they see and

02:36:43.161 --> 02:38:30.972
all of them have come on this Earth to see
the Mahayoga that is working through

02:38:30.972 --> 02:38:33.602
you people.

02:38:33.602 --> 02:38:39.562
That’s a good one.

02:38:39.562 --> 02:38:47.052
Very beautiful.

02:38:47.052 --> 02:38:54.401
Thank-you.

02:38:54.401 --> 02:39:34.241
[Applause]
You read it from there, on the…that’s

02:39:34.241 --> 02:39:35.241
better.

02:39:35.241 --> 02:39:59.952
Yogi: This song’s been written originally
by me but I had a lot of help from brother

02:39:59.952 --> 02:40:15.682
Sahaja Yogis in Sheffield and I need Gareth
Reynolds on the guitar.

02:40:15.682 --> 02:40:36.252
[Yogini sings You are the

02:40:36.252 --> 02:40:37.252
Ocean.]

02:40:37.252 --> 02:40:46.742
Shri Mataji: Well done.

02:40:46.742 --> 02:40:54.992
[Applause] It’s a good one.

02:40:54.992 --> 02:40:55.992
Very beautiful.

02:40:55.992 --> 02:40:57.462
Very good one.

02:40:57.462 --> 02:41:43.052
Very well composed and very well done
and it’s really, I must say, also musically

02:41:43.052 --> 02:41:52.071
it’s very well composed.

02:41:52.071 --> 02:42:07.882
May God bless you.

02:42:07.882 --> 02:42:11.832
Beautiful.

02:42:11.832 --> 02:42:17.502
That’s the quality.

02:42:17.502 --> 02:42:20.842
It’s beautiful.

02:42:20.842 --> 02:42:25.861
That is Sheffield.

02:42:25.861 --> 02:42:31.552
[Applause] Are you going to sing?

02:42:31.552 --> 02:42:35.892
You’d better go and eat, and if you want
I can eat also.

02:42:35.892 --> 02:42:37.552
It’s all right.

02:42:37.552 --> 02:42:39.791
So then music comes to a termination.

02:42:39.791 --> 02:42:45.142
I’m sorry, because they have to eat and
I have to go back to London.

02:42:45.142 --> 02:42:51.292
Hope to meet you again sometime, I hope so
before I go to India, I don’t know what

02:42:51.292 --> 02:43:02.382
is the thing but Gavin is trying to arrange
a big program somewhere, again, hoping that

02:43:02.382 --> 02:43:13.682
in London we’ll do better and some people
will have some sticking plasters with them.

02:43:13.682 --> 02:43:14.892
So let’s eat.

02:43:14.892 --> 02:43:17.332
May God bless you.

02:43:17.332 --> 02:43:22.212
What a thing you’ve found I must say.

02:43:22.212 --> 02:43:23.212
That company is the same as the one we saw
is it?

02:43:23.212 --> 02:43:24.212
Same style, is it the same style?

02:43:24.212 --> 02:43:25.212
Similar.

02:43:25.212 --> 02:43:26.212
Ah.

02:43:26.212 --> 02:43:27.212
But they had no guarantee, nothing and no
design.

02:43:27.212 --> 02:43:28.212
This has guarantee?

02:43:28.212 --> 02:43:30.821
It has.

02:43:30.821 --> 02:43:40.932
For how many years?
