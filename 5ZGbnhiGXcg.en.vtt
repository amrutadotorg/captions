00:10:50.363 --> 00:10:58.513
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:10:58.633 --> 00:11:09.993
At the very outset we have to understand that truth is what it is.

00:11:10.113 --> 00:11:12.523
We cannot conceptualize it.

00:11:12.643 --> 00:11:16.673
We cannot organize it.

00:11:16.793 --> 00:11:21.353
And we cannot use it for our own purposes.

00:11:21.473 --> 00:11:31.573
Moreover, with the blinkers on both the sides like a horse, with all our conditionings,

00:11:31.693 --> 00:11:33.903
we cannot find the truth.

00:11:34.023 --> 00:11:36.073
We have to be free people.

00:11:36.193 --> 00:11:46.473
We have to be open-minded people, like scientists, to see for ourselves what is the truth.

00:11:46.593 --> 00:11:56.303
If somebody preaches something, professes something, says something, is not to be accepted

00:11:56.423 --> 00:11:59.993
blindfolded.

00:12:00.113 --> 00:12:07.013
As I told you yesterday, that the essence of all the religions is to find the eternal

00:12:07.133 --> 00:12:16.683
and to treat the transitory in its own understanding and in its own limitations.

00:12:16.803 --> 00:12:20.663
That’s why we have lost our balance.

00:12:20.783 --> 00:12:35.293
If we are really the people who want to know the truth, we have to know that at human awareness

00:12:35.413 --> 00:12:38.433
we cannot know it.

00:12:38.553 --> 00:12:42.542
It becomes a concept.

00:12:42.662 --> 00:12:51.123
You have to have the spiritual awareness, but spiritual awareness is a state of your

00:12:51.243 --> 00:12:55.943
being, where you become the spirit.

00:12:56.063 --> 00:12:58.193
Again the word I’ll say – “become.”

00:12:58.313 --> 00:13:05.863
It’s not artificially certifying somebody that now you have become a Hindu or a Christian

00:13:05.983 --> 00:13:09.023
or a Muslim, you become anything.

00:13:09.143 --> 00:13:16.523
Because you may be a Muslim, Christian, Hindu, anything, you can commit any sin.

00:13:16.643 --> 00:13:19.783
You can do anything that is wrong.

00:13:19.903 --> 00:13:25.143
Nothing from inside is going to stop you.

00:13:25.263 --> 00:13:32.553
So all these things have become so much outward that now there are people who have started

00:13:32.673 --> 00:13:40.393
saying there is no God, there is nothing like religion, which is not true.

00:13:40.513 --> 00:13:48.583
First of all when we say there is nothing, or there is not God, we should find out, have

00:13:48.703 --> 00:13:57.823
we been able to find out about it or just in our ego we are saying there is no God?

00:13:57.943 --> 00:14:03.673
Have we been able to work it out to see if there is God or not?

00:14:03.793 --> 00:14:08.433
You do not judge God by the people who talk about God.

00:14:08.553 --> 00:14:14.403
Anybody can talk about God because they think there’s no law that can catch them.

00:14:14.523 --> 00:14:19.293
They can talk against Him, they can talk for Him, they can do the way they like.

00:14:19.413 --> 00:14:24.453
They can even make money by talking against God and against all the prophets – that’s

00:14:24.573 --> 00:14:30.183
a very good way of making money, blackmail.

00:14:30.303 --> 00:14:37.893
But does that mean that whatever is written is a bible, or whatever is black and white,

00:14:38.013 --> 00:14:43.043
is to be taken that seriously?

00:14:43.163 --> 00:14:52.333
So first of all, we have to be little independent to be free, to know that if you have to know

00:14:52.453 --> 00:15:00.433
the spirit - as they said “know thyself” - then you have to know it on your central

00:15:00.553 --> 00:15:02.153
nervous system.

00:15:02.273 --> 00:15:17.643
As I can feel this is cold or hot, you have to feel the divine power which is all-pervading,

00:15:17.763 --> 00:15:27.803
which is the truth, which manifests the truth, because it is the love of God.

00:15:27.923 --> 00:15:38.263
You have to first feel it on your central nervous system, which is the bodha.

00:15:38.383 --> 00:15:46.203
Now one may say that in the West we have advanced so much, all right.

00:15:46.323 --> 00:15:50.773
We have gone too far with everything.

00:15:50.893 --> 00:15:57.993
But if we see, when we started with science, what have we produced?

00:15:58.113 --> 00:16:04.583
Hydrogen bomb, atom bomb, all kinds of devils sitting on our heads.

00:16:04.703 --> 00:16:12.453
You take to any enterprise that we did, we go to extremes.

00:16:12.573 --> 00:16:15.183
There is no balance.

00:16:15.303 --> 00:16:21.572
Any mental projection is linear, it moves in one line and then recoils back, and then

00:16:21.692 --> 00:16:23.072
you are shocked.

00:16:23.192 --> 00:16:24.833
Now you have got acid rain.

00:16:24.953 --> 00:16:28.203
You produced machinery, all right.

00:16:28.323 --> 00:16:33.253
Machinery is for you, you are not for machinery.

00:16:33.373 --> 00:16:42.123
And thus, there is no balance between you and the machinery, no balance between you

00:16:42.243 --> 00:16:43.123
and the science.

00:16:43.243 --> 00:16:50.313
It is just like going amok with anything that you get into your hand.

00:16:50.433 --> 00:16:58.183
And this balance you can only have when you become the spirit.

00:16:58.303 --> 00:17:05.063
You see beautiful chandeliers here, beautifully made, but unless and until there is light

00:17:05.183 --> 00:17:09.693
what is the meaning of these chandeliers?

00:17:09.813 --> 00:17:11.523
Nothing.

00:17:11.643 --> 00:17:19.203
In the same way, if you do not have the light of the spirit shining in your attention, you

00:17:19.323 --> 00:17:20.743
will not know your meaning.

00:17:20.863 --> 00:17:26.413
Like this instrument – unless and until it is connected to the mains, it is useless.

00:17:26.533 --> 00:17:34.033
Unless and until we are connected to the mains, we do not know the absolute, and that’s

00:17:34.153 --> 00:17:37.243
why all these problems are there.

00:17:37.363 --> 00:17:50.813
Now when I am talking about this instrument, which lies within us, one has to again know

00:17:50.933 --> 00:17:56.723
that this is the knowledge of the roots.

00:17:56.843 --> 00:18:00.623
And to know the knowledge of the roots, you have to become a subtler personality.

00:18:00.743 --> 00:18:05.803
With a gross mind, you cannot see it.

00:18:05.923 --> 00:18:12.813
To become the subtler personality, minimum of minimum, you have to know that so far you

00:18:12.933 --> 00:18:15.613
have not known the roots.

00:18:15.733 --> 00:18:18.813
If you had known, there would be no problem.

00:18:18.933 --> 00:18:30.693
But there’s something has gone wrong somewhere in every human enterprise, even in religions,

00:18:30.813 --> 00:18:40.943
that’s why today we find this kind of a farce going on.

00:18:41.063 --> 00:18:48.483
And what is gone wrong is that we have to seek the eternal.

00:18:48.603 --> 00:18:56.443
Maybe it might look a little different, for example Buddha and Mahavira did not talk about

00:18:56.563 --> 00:18:58.823
God at all.

00:18:58.943 --> 00:19:07.663
I also did not talk about God for four years, at least three years.

00:19:07.783 --> 00:19:14.512
As soon as you talk of God, again people start jumping, “When can we become God?” – this

00:19:14.632 --> 00:19:18.233
is the first question.

00:19:18.353 --> 00:19:21.693
So first you become the self –the first step.

00:19:21.813 --> 00:19:24.582
That’s why they did not talk.

00:19:24.702 --> 00:19:28.303
They said first you become yourself.

00:19:28.423 --> 00:19:36.183
Unless and until you have your eyes, how can you see the colors?

00:19:36.303 --> 00:19:38.433
So first have your eyes.

00:19:38.553 --> 00:19:51.263
It is for your benevolence that you better get what you deserve, what is your own.

00:19:51.383 --> 00:19:57.343
It’s your birthright as a human being to become the spirit.

00:19:57.463 --> 00:20:01.803
That is what Sahaja Yoga is – Saha means “with” and ja is “born.”

00:20:01.923 --> 00:20:11.993
Born with you is the right to get this yoga, is the union with the Divine.

00:20:12.113 --> 00:20:16.693
It’s your birthright as a human being.

00:20:16.813 --> 00:20:21.823
You are as I told you at the epitome of evolution.

00:20:21.943 --> 00:20:31.533
And it has to work out, but please open your hearts and open your minds.

00:20:31.653 --> 00:20:35.133
Just open it and see for yourself, it will work, I know.

00:20:35.253 --> 00:20:36.593
Yesterday it has worked.

00:20:36.713 --> 00:20:39.303
It is going to work out today also.

00:20:39.423 --> 00:20:45.053
But by thinking about it, you cannot conceptualize.

00:20:45.173 --> 00:20:56.193
This is the biggest problem of our seeking that we run after some sort of a concept.

00:20:56.313 --> 00:21:03.353
Now here you have seen this instrument is the most beautiful instrument that is created

00:21:03.473 --> 00:21:08.693
within us during the process of our evolution.

00:21:08.813 --> 00:21:16.663
The first one is the most beautiful one because it stands for our innocence.

00:21:16.783 --> 00:21:24.933
This innocence is the one which gives us real support, real strength.

00:21:25.053 --> 00:21:30.493
And you’ll be surprised it is never destroyed.

00:21:30.613 --> 00:21:37.853
It may be overshadowed, there may be clouds.

00:21:37.973 --> 00:21:41.953
Maybe it may look to be a very dark sky.

00:21:42.073 --> 00:21:43.223
Maybe a hopeless case.

00:21:43.343 --> 00:21:48.072
Some people might say that we have destroyed our innocence.

00:21:48.192 --> 00:21:52.253
It cannot be destroyed.

00:21:52.373 --> 00:21:58.103
Whatever you might have done, this is one center which cannot be destroyed.

00:21:58.223 --> 00:22:02.203
You may have problems with it but it cannot be destroyed.

00:22:02.323 --> 00:22:08.653
It is such a wonderful center you have got, which has got four petals, which looks after

00:22:08.773 --> 00:22:15.983
the pelvic plexus, looks after all the excretion within us.

00:22:16.103 --> 00:22:25.933
In our own freedom, so-called, we do all kinds of things which may not be benevolent for

00:22:26.053 --> 00:22:30.392
ourselves, doesn’t matter.

00:22:30.512 --> 00:22:44.892
Kundalini cannot be destroyed - the source which is going to give you the self-realization,

00:22:45.012 --> 00:22:48.683
I say She is your individual Mother.

00:22:48.803 --> 00:22:55.643
And this Mother is such a loving Mother and She knows each and everything about you - from

00:22:55.763 --> 00:23:01.183
your past, from your past lives - She knows you very well.

00:23:01.303 --> 00:23:09.353
She is just waiting for a chance that She can be awakened and She can give you your

00:23:09.473 --> 00:23:10.663
second birth.

00:23:10.783 --> 00:23:16.343
When you were born, your mother suffered for you – you did not suffer.

00:23:16.463 --> 00:23:21.903
So to say that Kundalini awakening gives this kind of a nonsense and that kind of a nonsense

00:23:22.023 --> 00:23:25.093
is all falsehood.

00:23:25.213 --> 00:23:27.353
Absolutely falsehood.

00:23:27.473 --> 00:23:33.723
And it is so absurd that how can a mother give you problems?

00:23:33.843 --> 00:23:40.603
I mean, I don’t know about some mothers are funny also – that’s all human problems.

00:23:40.723 --> 00:23:43.593
But this is a Divine Mother.

00:23:43.713 --> 00:23:48.413
She’s not going to give you trouble.

00:23:48.533 --> 00:23:55.473
But these problems that have come are coming from people who have no authority, who have

00:23:55.593 --> 00:23:59.473
no education, who do not know what Kundalini is.

00:23:59.593 --> 00:24:05.473
Some say it is in the stomach, some say in the head, some say in the legs.

00:24:05.593 --> 00:24:12.153
Those who have no character of their own, because they have to be pure people themselves,

00:24:12.273 --> 00:24:18.512
try all kinds of nonsensical tricks and create problems on the sympathetic nervous system

00:24:18.632 --> 00:24:26.363
and they call it as something that it is the problem of the Kundalini.

00:24:26.483 --> 00:24:30.303
Kundalini will never give you any problems.

00:24:30.423 --> 00:24:36.343
On the contrary, when She rises and when you get your awakening, the first thing that is

00:24:36.463 --> 00:24:39.343
established is thoughtless awareness.

00:24:39.463 --> 00:24:50.882
For when a thought rises, falls, another thought rises, falls, and the Kundalini makes the

00:24:51.002 --> 00:24:56.192
thoughts smaller and in between at the present.

00:24:56.312 --> 00:25:05.233
It makes you stop in the present and you grow in the present, and the thoughts, if you want

00:25:05.353 --> 00:25:09.832
to think you can think, if you don’t want to think, it is not like a madhouse going

00:25:09.952 --> 00:25:16.142
on all the time, you don’t know how to stop it.

00:25:16.262 --> 00:25:24.263
This works out with the Kundalini’s awakening when She crosses this center of ours, which

00:25:24.383 --> 00:25:26.192
we call as Agnya chakra.

00:25:26.312 --> 00:25:29.813
Now we should not have, again I say, blinkers about Christ.

00:25:29.933 --> 00:25:36.403
Let us see what people have to say about Christ in other shastras and scriptures.

00:25:36.523 --> 00:25:41.203
Who was He?

00:25:41.323 --> 00:25:47.313
Because people did not allow Him to manifest for more than four years and in four years

00:25:47.433 --> 00:25:48.622
what can you do?

00:25:48.742 --> 00:25:52.072
You cannot do anything.

00:25:52.192 --> 00:25:58.753
I must tell you in London I came, My husband was selected for a job and that’s how we

00:25:58.873 --> 00:26:05.873
are here, and for four years I was struggling with seven of them, just struggling.

00:26:05.993 --> 00:26:11.033
Giving realization was such a difficult subject to the English people at that time.

00:26:11.153 --> 00:26:14.213
They are hard nuts, I know.

00:26:14.333 --> 00:26:18.763
But once they break, they are the best.

00:26:18.883 --> 00:26:20.723
I think the best are the hardest.

00:26:20.843 --> 00:26:25.723
And it worked, it clicked.

00:26:25.843 --> 00:26:34.572
I am surprised that I had to work very hard but they are such a foundation of Sahaja Yoga.

00:26:34.692 --> 00:26:39.543
Immediately they went all out and very scholarly also – a lot of scholarship in them.

00:26:39.663 --> 00:26:46.352
Found out all about Kundalini, everything from wherever – your libraries are so well-equipped.

00:26:46.472 --> 00:26:50.533
And I was surprised, it was all there.

00:26:50.653 --> 00:26:53.153
They studied Sanskrit.

00:26:53.273 --> 00:26:59.463
Now can you imagine these people English singing Sanskrit song with that speed?

00:26:59.583 --> 00:27:04.153
They could not even say one sentence in Hindi when they were in India.

00:27:04.273 --> 00:27:09.923
Three hundred years they were there, they could not speak one sentence you will be surprised.

00:27:10.043 --> 00:27:14.553
We had to tell them in English how to speak Hindi.

00:27:14.673 --> 00:27:21.423
Like you have to say “open the door” – is in Hindi, is darwaja khol do.

00:27:21.543 --> 00:27:22.423
They couldn’t say it.

00:27:22.543 --> 00:27:27.413
So we had to say, “there was a banker” or something like that – means “close

00:27:27.533 --> 00:27:28.842
the door” – “there was a banker.”

00:27:28.962 --> 00:27:32.393
They couldn’t speak Hindi.

00:27:32.513 --> 00:27:34.503
Sanskrit is very far off.

00:27:34.623 --> 00:27:37.592
And now look at them, what has happened to them.

00:27:37.712 --> 00:27:44.193
And Indian music is such a difficult music, you have to really, it is a question of penance,

00:27:44.313 --> 00:27:45.273
tremendous penance.

00:27:45.393 --> 00:27:51.143
Now we have people who play beautiful tabla, beautiful instruments not only but sing so

00:27:51.263 --> 00:27:52.143
well.

00:27:52.263 --> 00:28:00.343
Swiss, the hardest nuts you can ever think of, they are - you’ll be amazed the Swiss

00:28:00.463 --> 00:28:09.323
the way they sing, tremendous manifestation in such a short time.

00:28:09.443 --> 00:28:15.273
Of course they can also sing English very well, they know English music very well, or

00:28:15.393 --> 00:28:17.493
should say Western music very well.

00:28:17.613 --> 00:28:22.822
But to learn this difficult melodies of India is remarkable.

00:28:22.942 --> 00:28:25.873
I am myself surprised at this.

00:28:25.993 --> 00:28:33.883
So what happens in the second center when it enters, you just become dynamic, because

00:28:34.003 --> 00:28:38.713
the second center is for aesthetics and for creativity.

00:28:38.833 --> 00:28:48.663
Now we have, like My brother who was a chartered accountant, he was very bad at all the languages.

00:28:48.783 --> 00:28:51.403
Very bad, of course Sanskrit was out of question.

00:28:51.523 --> 00:28:58.243
Now he is making poetry in Sanskrit and in Urdu language and also in Marathi, which is

00:28:58.363 --> 00:29:01.243
the most difficult language.

00:29:01.363 --> 00:29:02.293
This is the second center.

00:29:02.413 --> 00:29:09.463
When Kundalini nourishes that center, like a very beautiful Mother she nourishes.

00:29:09.583 --> 00:29:17.542
You must have heard about some great artists – Amjad Ali, he was here – after realization

00:29:17.662 --> 00:29:19.023
he became such a great artist.

00:29:19.143 --> 00:29:21.403
There are so many artists.

00:29:21.523 --> 00:29:23.312
In India, they understand.

00:29:23.432 --> 00:29:24.893
They want to sing before Me.

00:29:25.013 --> 00:29:29.833
I mean I don’t know how to say that now only one person can sing.

00:29:29.953 --> 00:29:37.483
Because their Kundalini goes up, and the creativity becomes so tremendously active and so dynamic.

00:29:37.603 --> 00:29:46.133
At the same time, that person becomes very mild, very sweet, very compassionate.

00:29:46.253 --> 00:29:49.743
Like there’s one great singer.

00:29:49.863 --> 00:29:53.273
She’s a Muslim lady, I will not name her.

00:29:53.393 --> 00:29:56.923
She wanted to sing and she sent Me word, “Please allow me to sing in Your birthday.”

00:29:57.043 --> 00:29:59.042
And I said, “All right, give her a chance.”

00:29:59.162 --> 00:30:01.102
So she came down.

00:30:01.222 --> 00:30:07.993
And the lady who was playing harmonium – she came and told Me, “This lady is just an

00:30:08.113 --> 00:30:15.433
atom bomb, You don’t know how she gets angry if there’s one note I play wrong.”

00:30:15.553 --> 00:30:21.292
I saw her but she was very silently playing – nothing doing, she never got angry with

00:30:21.412 --> 00:30:22.292
anyone.

00:30:22.412 --> 00:30:26.483
So in the interval, this lady comes and tells Me, “That see in Your presence, I don’t

00:30:26.603 --> 00:30:29.433
know what has happened to this lady.

00:30:29.553 --> 00:30:33.342
This tiger has become like a cow.

00:30:33.462 --> 00:30:34.793
How is it?”

00:30:34.913 --> 00:30:38.203
I said, “See her Kundalini has come up.”

00:30:38.323 --> 00:30:47.542
So this violence, this anger, this temper is not your creation, it’s the creation

00:30:47.662 --> 00:30:48.743
of your liver.

00:30:48.863 --> 00:31:00.183
Your liver is little out of order because of many things, and the temper is there.

00:31:00.303 --> 00:31:03.743
Now when the temper is too much, you don’t know what to do.

00:31:03.863 --> 00:31:06.213
I mean you can do whatever you like.

00:31:06.333 --> 00:31:10.572
In your temper after all, it’s like a drunken personality.

00:31:10.692 --> 00:31:15.623
You have to approach a person in a temper with a barge pole.

00:31:15.743 --> 00:31:20.433
But all this temper, everything, becomes so cool and so beautiful.

00:31:20.553 --> 00:31:23.463
It’s very surprising.

00:31:23.583 --> 00:31:32.153
A very dynamic person becomes extremely compassionate, extremely compassionate, and I’ve had such

00:31:32.273 --> 00:31:41.683
beautiful experiences of their compassion that it’s not easy to describe.

00:31:41.803 --> 00:31:49.223
Now also they say that there are certain nationalities which has got a trait like this and a trait

00:31:49.343 --> 00:31:53.383
like that, everything dissolves.

00:31:53.503 --> 00:32:02.483
Everything dissolves because of this center which is so creative and which also gives

00:32:02.603 --> 00:32:09.433
you the manifestation of pure knowledge - pure knowledge.

00:32:09.553 --> 00:32:16.352
For example you start feeling on your finger tips – you just start feeling on your finger

00:32:16.472 --> 00:32:17.352
tips.

00:32:17.472 --> 00:32:24.243
Like today only, somebody came and told Me, “That Mataji my Agnya is catching.”

00:32:24.363 --> 00:32:30.403
Agnya is this center - means “I’ve got my ego on.”

00:32:30.523 --> 00:32:32.542
Will anybody say like that?

00:32:32.662 --> 00:32:36.283
On the contrary if you tell somebody, “You have got your ego,” they’ll show you that

00:32:36.403 --> 00:32:38.082
they have their ego on.

00:32:38.202 --> 00:32:42.173
It’s very dangerous to say to somebody that your ego is on.

00:32:42.293 --> 00:32:48.513
But just because of self knowledge - pure knowledge - you know that this Mr. Ego is

00:32:48.633 --> 00:32:59.033
sitting here and I cannot cross through and there’s a blockage here, which I have to

00:32:59.153 --> 00:33:00.183
take it out.

00:33:00.303 --> 00:33:04.443
It’s so innate within you, everything, only thing is your connection has to be made.

00:33:04.563 --> 00:33:08.653
Once the connection is made, immediately you know about yourself.

00:33:08.773 --> 00:33:20.623
And this center which is responsible for creating all kinds of funny thoughts and horrible creativity

00:33:20.743 --> 00:33:26.513
becomes so benevolent, so soothing, so beautiful.

00:33:26.633 --> 00:33:34.653
Apart from that, as I told you just now, these people who could not even say one word in

00:33:34.773 --> 00:33:41.543
Hindi language have started singing Sanskrit and this - specially the one they sang, the

00:33:41.663 --> 00:33:48.953
first one - many Indians cannot sing that way I can tell you, they can’t.

00:33:49.073 --> 00:33:50.633
It’s not easy.

00:33:50.753 --> 00:33:54.993
It’s a very great tongue twister first of all the language is.

00:33:55.113 --> 00:34:02.503
Apart from that, to sing in such a correct pronunciation is so difficult but they have

00:34:02.623 --> 00:34:06.903
done it.

00:34:07.023 --> 00:34:13.983
So in Sahaja Yoga, an artist who is struggling today may become a great artist tomorrow.

00:34:14.103 --> 00:34:18.293
But still I would say these are temptations.

00:34:18.413 --> 00:34:23.123
You’ll become a great artist, you’ll start earning more money, this, that…but that’s

00:34:23.243 --> 00:34:24.523
not the one.

00:34:24.643 --> 00:34:30.393
You have to really be satisfied with, you will never be satisfied with that.

00:34:30.513 --> 00:34:37.693
So you move to the third center which we call as the Nabhi chakra.

00:34:37.813 --> 00:34:46.943
This center is, on one side, is made of water and another side with fire.

00:34:47.063 --> 00:34:59.192
Around it are our ten valencies, which we can call as our innate religion within ourselves.

00:34:59.533 --> 00:35:05.699
Now this Nabhi itself, or we can call the solar plexus

00:35:05.871 --> 00:35:11.681
or we can say the Navel chakra

00:35:11.802 --> 00:35:17.821
gives us, as soon as the Kundalini rises,

00:35:17.941 --> 00:35:20.972
she awakens this and the light when it spreads,

00:35:21.093 --> 00:35:22.504
you become religious.

00:35:22.625 --> 00:35:27.323
I don’t have to tell you anything, you just become.

00:35:27.443 --> 00:35:31.489
I don’t have to say that you don’t take drugs, you just don’t take it.

00:35:31.671 --> 00:35:34.998
Overnight I have seen people have given up drugs.

00:35:35.119 --> 00:35:38.093
Overnight, alcoholism. Overnight, everything.

00:35:38.214 --> 00:35:42.664
And they enjoy their virtues.
That’s the best part of it.

00:35:42.785 --> 00:35:45.370
Some people think, well then what is the fun?

00:35:45.491 --> 00:35:53.683
What is this that you take something in the pub and next day you have hangover.

00:35:53.804 --> 00:35:58.917
Here you take something and next day you are much better off.

00:35:59.038 --> 00:36:03.520
It never comes down. It never gives you a reaction.

00:36:03.641 --> 00:36:07.313
It’s not artificial.
It’s not intoxicating.

00:36:07.434 --> 00:36:12.130
It is from your nerves it’s bubbling out.

00:36:12.251 --> 00:36:15.709
So this is the center which is very important in us

00:36:15.830 --> 00:36:20.672
because most of us have a problem with
this center.

00:36:22.484 --> 00:36:29.797
And here we have a capacity by this center

00:36:29.917 --> 00:36:38.226
that we enjoy our generosity.

00:36:41.211 --> 00:36:45.366
Now all matter whatever it is -
we are materialistic, materialistic,

00:36:45.486 --> 00:36:48.254
it is a good idea to be materialistic.

00:36:48.375 --> 00:36:53.831
But the matter is, the aesthetics of matters are,

00:36:53.951 --> 00:36:58.711
that you can give it to others suggesting
your love in it.

00:36:58.887 --> 00:37:02.747
I think that’s the only thing the matter can do.

00:37:04.382 --> 00:37:09.082
And in a very special way you can express that love.

00:37:09.082 --> 00:37:13.416
For example, somebody likes a particular thing

00:37:13.536 --> 00:37:16.133
you go all the way to get it

00:37:16.253 --> 00:37:21.502
and give that small thing, very small thing,

00:37:21.622 --> 00:37:26.491
to the person and the joy,

00:37:26.611 --> 00:37:30.102
not out of the money that you have spent,

00:37:30.222 --> 00:37:39.021
but the feelings you have expressed
of knowing what that person would love.

00:37:39.423 --> 00:37:45.720
And this kind of a depth develops within you.

00:37:47.381 --> 00:37:54.804
Such lovable beautiful society you enter into.

00:37:55.907 --> 00:38:00.622
And you don’t need anything because everybody is looking after your needs.

00:38:00.742 --> 00:38:06.312
Now I have told them I love flowers because I don’t take anything else.

00:38:06.432 --> 00:38:10.792
So you must see whenever I come My house is so filled with flowers that My husband was

00:38:10.912 --> 00:38:14.372
saying, “Let us go live in the garden and let the flowers be here.”

00:38:14.492 --> 00:38:24.762
So you see the joy of giving, comes from this center.

00:38:24.882 --> 00:38:35.382
And whatever you eat, whatever you have to eat, whatever is good for you, you eat.

00:38:35.502 --> 00:38:40.811
You don’t have to bother as to what to eat, what not to eat – you just eat whatever

00:38:40.931 --> 00:38:43.082
is good for you, benevolent for you.

00:38:43.202 --> 00:38:48.692
You become so wise and also you please others.

00:38:48.812 --> 00:38:53.342
You don’t displease others by saying, “This is bad food, I want that.”

00:38:53.462 --> 00:38:55.402
’I want’ goes away.

00:38:55.522 --> 00:38:57.882
What do you want?

00:38:58.002 --> 00:39:00.602
[speaks aside]

00:39:00.722 --> 00:39:10.541
So the, like you could say a candle which is not enlightened, is waiting to be enlightened,

00:39:10.661 --> 00:39:14.872
is asking for the light – “I want light.”

00:39:14.992 --> 00:39:22.162
But once it is enlightened, it gives light to others, automatically - supposed to be.

00:39:22.282 --> 00:39:31.002
In the same way you also start giving your light, your love, your joy to others, automatically.

00:39:31.122 --> 00:39:33.632
I don’t have to tell you.

00:39:33.752 --> 00:39:37.751
Nobody has to go through any Ten Commandments anymore.

00:39:37.871 --> 00:39:39.742
Those days are gone.

00:39:39.862 --> 00:39:55.182
Now automatically you become like that - very beautiful people, very affectionate and glorious,

00:39:55.302 --> 00:39:56.182
I should say.

00:39:56.302 --> 00:40:03.761
If you see the glow on the face of Sahaja Yogis, the face itself is radiant.

00:40:03.881 --> 00:40:13.952
Many people drop out their ten years to twenty years in their age and they are so enthusiastic,

00:40:14.072 --> 00:40:21.691
never get tired, especially in England I’ve seen – or also in the West I would say everywhere

00:40:21.811 --> 00:40:23.572
– people get very really tired.

00:40:23.692 --> 00:40:27.082
On the television also you find people will come and sit down “huh…”

00:40:27.202 --> 00:40:34.932
Young people, they’ll talk ten times, they’ll say “huh…

00:40:35.052 --> 00:40:39.302
Why are we so tired?”

00:40:39.422 --> 00:40:41.551
Because we think too much.

00:40:41.671 --> 00:40:48.182
All energy is wasted in thinking, so no energy left to enjoy anything whatsoever.

00:40:48.302 --> 00:40:55.652
For example, you have to have people for dinner, they think what to bring, how to make it formal,

00:40:55.772 --> 00:41:01.192
what to do, this thing, that thing, so agitated and so nervous about the whole thing – when

00:41:01.312 --> 00:41:05.532
the guests come in, they feel like running away.

00:41:05.652 --> 00:41:09.521
Because so much of tension of thinking, thinking, thinking…..

00:41:09.641 --> 00:41:13.352
Planning, planning, planning, planning, planning…

00:41:13.472 --> 00:41:17.481
Ultimately the whole joy has disappeared.

00:41:17.601 --> 00:41:28.362
So the second center which is there, it does a very miraculous thing, is to provide the

00:41:28.482 --> 00:41:35.012
grey cells in our brain, when we are using it for thinking, and also it looks after your

00:41:35.132 --> 00:41:46.162
liver, your pancreas, your spleen, your kidneys and lower part of your abdomen.

00:41:46.282 --> 00:41:52.462
Instead of doing that, poor thing is busy only sending grey cells to your brain because

00:41:52.582 --> 00:41:56.262
thinking, thinking, thinking, thinking, like mad.

00:41:56.382 --> 00:42:02.362
So you develop all other diseases – liver trouble, which is very common.

00:42:02.482 --> 00:42:06.642
Then you develop diabetes – very common.

00:42:06.762 --> 00:42:14.612
Yesterday at least there were ten people who said we have diabetes.

00:42:14.732 --> 00:42:19.271
Now diabetes you do not develop by taking too much sugar – take it from Me.

00:42:19.391 --> 00:42:26.342
In India if you go to a village, you’ll see that he takes sugar in such a manner that

00:42:26.462 --> 00:42:31.791
in the cup the spoon must stand at right angles, otherwise he won’t take it.

00:42:31.911 --> 00:42:34.412
But he never gets diabetes.

00:42:34.532 --> 00:42:41.282
The reason is he doesn’t think of tomorrow - he just works hard, eats his food and sleeps

00:42:41.402 --> 00:42:42.422
off, nicely.

00:42:42.542 --> 00:42:45.822
He doesn’t take sleeping pills either.

00:42:45.942 --> 00:42:53.791
So this diabetes comes by over-thinking and can be easily cured if you can take to Sahaja

00:42:53.911 --> 00:43:00.501
Yoga, which I’ll tell you how we’ll stop our thinking at this, I’ve already told

00:43:00.621 --> 00:43:03.021
you, at this point.

00:43:03.141 --> 00:43:08.092
Then the third disease which is even more dangerous than this, is the disease which

00:43:08.212 --> 00:43:12.522
we call as blood cancer.

00:43:12.642 --> 00:43:15.981
Blood cancer is caused only to people who think too much.

00:43:16.101 --> 00:43:22.422
It can even be to the children if the mother is very meticulous, particular about her carpets

00:43:22.542 --> 00:43:26.781
or her house, everything you know and even a rat doesn’t enter that house.

00:43:26.901 --> 00:43:32.122
But she is very careful that all her things are properly done, her sink doesn’t have

00:43:32.242 --> 00:43:37.442
even so much of, little bit of a spot left in it.

00:43:37.562 --> 00:43:43.802
All the time, thinking, planning, thinking, planning.

00:43:43.922 --> 00:43:48.073
This affects the child and a child also can get blood cancer.

00:43:48.193 --> 00:43:57.422
Blood cancer you get it because your spleen is a speedometer- is the one which gives you

00:43:57.542 --> 00:44:00.922
the rhythm of life, rhythm of life.

00:44:01.042 --> 00:44:11.872
Now when we are hectic people, all the time under shock, then this goes out of order.

00:44:11.992 --> 00:44:22.582
For example in the morning we get up and see the newspaper and what you find, these Iranians

00:44:22.702 --> 00:44:26.992
have killed someone – such a shock.

00:44:27.112 --> 00:44:29.382
Then an accident, then…

00:44:29.502 --> 00:44:31.692
I mean newspaper will never give good news, will they?

00:44:31.812 --> 00:44:39.542
Will they give news, how many people got realization or something is working out all, all right?

00:44:39.662 --> 00:44:45.762
No something horrible that should shock your heads, shock your limbic area – otherwise

00:44:45.882 --> 00:44:49.672
you’ll not take it seriously.

00:44:49.792 --> 00:44:56.502
So, once you read that, you don’t know your system is a very delicate system, it gets

00:44:56.622 --> 00:44:57.742
a shock.

00:44:57.862 --> 00:45:01.852
And then you get into your car, without taking your breakfast, or maybe in your hand is the

00:45:01.972 --> 00:45:03.972
breakfast because you are late.

00:45:04.092 --> 00:45:09.152
On the way there is a jam – you are shouting, screaming - somehow or other you reach the

00:45:09.272 --> 00:45:15.482
office and there is the boss barking.

00:45:15.602 --> 00:45:18.892
This is how we live, under complete tension.

00:45:19.012 --> 00:45:22.772
We are supposed to be free people.

00:45:22.892 --> 00:45:30.272
In the night if you sing loudly the neighbor will come and put you to the police station.

00:45:30.392 --> 00:45:33.392
I mean you can’t do anything.

00:45:33.512 --> 00:45:35.272
There’s no freedom.

00:45:35.392 --> 00:45:38.002
You have to be bound by the watch.

00:45:38.122 --> 00:45:42.592
This is the time, exact you have to reach there.

00:45:42.712 --> 00:45:49.372
So all these things, pressures, and all these things work on us and we become hectic.

00:45:49.492 --> 00:46:00.302
And for emergency, this spleen is the one which releases red blood corpuscles – RBCs.

00:46:00.422 --> 00:46:05.802
But if you are all the time like this hectic, that poor spleen becomes mad.

00:46:05.922 --> 00:46:09.722
It doesn’t know what to do.

00:46:09.842 --> 00:46:16.352
It starts producing more cells, more cells and then it thinks it’s a mad person I am

00:46:16.472 --> 00:46:20.462
fixed with because I don’t know when to act, when not to act.

00:46:20.582 --> 00:46:25.132
So the vulnerability is there, and suddenly with some other shock, you might get blood

00:46:25.252 --> 00:46:30.812
cancer and then the doctors will certify you are going to die after one month.

00:46:30.932 --> 00:46:34.162
Finished, prepare for your burial.

00:46:34.282 --> 00:46:38.172
And the whole house is crying.

00:46:38.292 --> 00:46:52.452
But we have cured, I mean Sahaja Yoga has cured blood cancer of many people just by

00:46:52.572 --> 00:46:59.872
this Kundalini awakening because as soon as the Kundalini is awakened, too much movement

00:46:59.992 --> 00:47:05.062
this side and that side, this all the time going on, in the center – this is the left

00:47:05.182 --> 00:47:09.922
and the right side of the sympathetic – so just the Kundalini passes through, strings

00:47:10.042 --> 00:47:17.602
through and brings it back and nourishes it.

00:47:17.722 --> 00:47:19.682
The problem is over.

00:47:19.802 --> 00:47:26.982
And though they were certified to be dead, after even four years they are all right,

00:47:27.102 --> 00:47:35.862
working all right, the certificate is cancelled.

00:47:35.982 --> 00:47:44.222
Even vulnerability to cancer, or to all incurable diseases, are because of these centers going

00:47:44.342 --> 00:47:50.432
out of place.

00:47:50.552 --> 00:47:57.752
Now we have the center which we call here as the heart center.

00:47:57.872 --> 00:48:04.732
It controls the left and right, both – so we have a left and right heart in Sahaja Yoga.

00:48:04.852 --> 00:48:17.142
As you know that, this sternum bone creates the antibodies for you.

00:48:17.262 --> 00:48:22.622
And these antibodies fight your diseases.

00:48:22.742 --> 00:48:33.233
So when this center goes out, this is the center which sends all the messages to these

00:48:33.353 --> 00:48:36.762
antibodies.

00:48:36.882 --> 00:48:41.532
Now this is the center of a mother.

00:48:41.652 --> 00:48:48.181
When your motherhood is challenged, you develop breast cancer.

00:48:48.301 --> 00:48:56.752
Supposing a man is a flirt and his wife is worried, she might get a breast cancer, because

00:48:56.872 --> 00:49:08.222
her motherhood is challenged and her sense of security is very disturbed.

00:49:08.342 --> 00:49:16.072
As a result of that, she gets this problem.

00:49:16.192 --> 00:49:23.282
Also if you are too much of a thinker, and you think too much and you’re very, what

00:49:23.402 --> 00:49:29.442
we call the right-sided, the futuristic planner, I mean people plan it for ten years.

00:49:29.562 --> 00:49:34.972
They plan even their deaths, what dress they are going to wear and where they are going

00:49:35.092 --> 00:49:40.202
to be buried, up to that point.

00:49:40.322 --> 00:49:49.322
All this futuristic planning creates such tremendous heat in the body because the liver,

00:49:49.442 --> 00:49:55.662
which is supposed to absorb all the heat, is neglected by this center.

00:49:55.782 --> 00:50:01.072
As a result that heat travels up and you develop asthma.

00:50:01.192 --> 00:50:08.032
Now we had yesterday, at least five or six people who came with asthma.

00:50:08.152 --> 00:50:11.702
Asthma is absolutely curable.

00:50:11.822 --> 00:50:15.922
But do you know this is the center of a husband, or of the father.

00:50:16.042 --> 00:50:20.862
Now if I am telling you, you should not be shocked, because later on you’ll find it.

00:50:20.982 --> 00:50:25.392
Now if you are a bad husband, you can get asthma.

00:50:25.512 --> 00:50:30.692
Or if your wife is a shrew, you might get an asthma.

00:50:30.812 --> 00:50:36.292
Or if you are a very bad father, you might get an asthma.

00:50:36.412 --> 00:50:42.492
Or if your father is not kind to you, you might get an asthma.

00:50:42.612 --> 00:50:47.812
If you have not forgiven your father, you might get asthma.

00:50:47.932 --> 00:50:54.532
Now can you believe it, just forgiving your father, you can get out of your asthma permanently.

00:50:54.652 --> 00:50:58.002
Sahaja Yoga has cured asthma of so many people.

00:50:58.122 --> 00:51:02.602
Believe it or not, it works.

00:51:02.722 --> 00:51:11.922
It looks so funny but our relationships, our parents we have chosen when we came on this

00:51:12.042 --> 00:51:12.922
Earth.

00:51:13.042 --> 00:51:19.312
I know they are wrong, they are obstinate, they’re headstrong, they may be drunkards,

00:51:19.432 --> 00:51:20.782
whatever they are.

00:51:20.902 --> 00:51:25.782
But even if you leave them, because so many people leave the parents, still forgive them

00:51:25.902 --> 00:51:26.782
and forget.

00:51:26.902 --> 00:51:29.162
Otherwise you carry the problems with you.

00:51:29.282 --> 00:51:37.632
The left heart is the place of the mother.

00:51:37.752 --> 00:51:42.352
Now if your mother has been hard with you, if you have had very bad experiences, you

00:51:42.472 --> 00:51:47.182
will have problems of the left heart.

00:51:47.302 --> 00:51:51.492
Center heart is very important where your sense of security should be established.

00:51:51.612 --> 00:51:56.782
You’ll be surprised in the disease called AIDS, it is the center heart which is out.

00:51:56.902 --> 00:52:04.252
We have tried to cure, and we cured also 3, 4 people from AIDS, but they have no will-power

00:52:04.372 --> 00:52:07.602
to continue with Sahaja Yoga, they want to die.

00:52:07.722 --> 00:52:13.452
And they have made a big martyrdom out of it, you see they are martyrs, great martyrs

00:52:13.572 --> 00:52:16.242
of a great principle they have established.

00:52:16.362 --> 00:52:22.582
It’s impossible to convince to them, that this is unnatural that you are doing and that

00:52:22.702 --> 00:52:25.472
you should give it up and you should live, why should you die?

00:52:25.592 --> 00:52:30.922
No, we are martyrs for such a big principle we have established.

00:52:31.042 --> 00:52:36.652
To do something out of the way and new is the modern fashion.

00:52:36.772 --> 00:52:44.002
Anything - will do something with the hair, with the nose, with the eyes, with the ears,

00:52:44.122 --> 00:52:45.312
with the clothes.

00:52:45.432 --> 00:52:47.501
That’s all you can do.

00:52:47.621 --> 00:52:56.732
To such an extent that they do not realize that whatever is new may not be good for you.

00:52:56.852 --> 00:52:58.872
For example, everyday we eat our dinner.

00:52:58.992 --> 00:53:05.702
Supposing we want to eat the table because it is new – is it a sensible thing?

00:53:05.822 --> 00:53:09.212
Anything that is new, is not good.

00:53:09.332 --> 00:53:12.292
But anything that is old, may not be good also.

00:53:12.412 --> 00:53:17.982
So you have to have that wisdom which comes to you through Sahaja Yoga.

00:53:18.102 --> 00:53:24.332
There is no other way out - you have to become the spirit, and you have to see in the light

00:53:24.452 --> 00:53:27.312
of the spirit, what is right and what is wrong.

00:53:27.432 --> 00:53:35.792
So then wecome to this center which is, we call as the Vishuddhi – this has sixteen

00:53:35.912 --> 00:53:37.932
petals, looks after the cervical plexus.

00:53:38.052 --> 00:53:43.732
Now this is a very very important center and this is the center is for communication.

00:53:43.852 --> 00:53:48.582
For example, when you talk, you communicate through your hands.

00:53:48.702 --> 00:53:52.632
You shake hands, you touch somebody, and you can communicate.

00:53:52.752 --> 00:53:56.482
Even if you cannot talk, with your hands you can communicate.

00:53:56.602 --> 00:54:06.522
Also when we think we are very responsible, this center goes out.

00:54:06.642 --> 00:54:12.922
Like some people were traveling by plane - they were from villages, they did not know what

00:54:13.042 --> 00:54:14.192
was a plane.

00:54:14.312 --> 00:54:21.452
They were told to take less luggage because it should not be a weight for the plane.

00:54:21.572 --> 00:54:24.262
So they got into the plane and put all of the luggage on their heads.

00:54:24.382 --> 00:54:31.132
And they said that “We are trying to reduce the weight of the plane.”

00:54:31.252 --> 00:54:38.762
In the same way, we are also... actually the One - which is all-pervading power, which

00:54:38.882 --> 00:54:43.092
has created us, created this universe and has brought us to this level of human beings

00:54:43.212 --> 00:54:44.532
- is doing everything.

00:54:44.652 --> 00:54:49.692
But we think we are responsible, we have to do it.

00:54:49.812 --> 00:54:54.212
But once you become a Sahaja Yogi you just do it, no doubt.

00:54:54.332 --> 00:54:57.512
But you don’t think that you are doing anything.

00:54:57.632 --> 00:54:59.342
You just say its happening.

00:54:59.462 --> 00:55:02.382
And what a beautiful feeling it is.

00:55:02.502 --> 00:55:08.912
Then you don’t have blood pressures, you don’t have headaches, you don’t have tensions

00:55:09.032 --> 00:55:11.642
– no, because we are not doing it.

00:55:11.762 --> 00:55:18.972
It is just done and you find it’s all done.

00:55:19.092 --> 00:55:27.182
Now on this center when we come, as I’ve told you, your thinking is controlled by you,

00:55:27.302 --> 00:55:28.312
you can control.

00:55:28.432 --> 00:55:31.952
If you want you can think or you don’t think.

00:55:32.072 --> 00:55:35.532
But in that silence you feel your peace.

00:55:35.652 --> 00:55:44.092
If there’s too much of crowds, too much of problems, suddenly you become the witness.

00:55:44.212 --> 00:55:46.602
You start seeing everything.

00:55:46.722 --> 00:55:50.742
Seeing the problem, what it is.

00:55:50.862 --> 00:55:55.252
Unless and until you can see the problem you cannot solve it.

00:55:55.372 --> 00:55:58.072
Because you are in the problem, you just get upset.

00:55:58.192 --> 00:56:01.972
But if you are out of the problem, you can see it.

00:56:02.092 --> 00:56:08.402
And that’s what happens to you when you become thoughtlessly aware when this center

00:56:08.522 --> 00:56:10.022
opens out.

00:56:10.142 --> 00:56:18.002
Last but not the least is the center of limbic area which is very important.

00:56:18.122 --> 00:56:22.752
Now I do not know it has been discovered or not, but it will be very soon discovered,

00:56:22.872 --> 00:56:31.262
that very strong things like cracks and all that have got sulfuric acid in it, and that

00:56:31.382 --> 00:56:36.672
doesn’t go anywhere in the body, just rushes into the limbic area.

00:56:36.792 --> 00:56:44.092
Now this limbic area is a hollow place which has got all cells here very sensitive to joy

00:56:44.212 --> 00:56:45.282
and happiness.

00:56:45.402 --> 00:56:53.342
But they become numb, so numb that ordinary music you cannot hear - somebody has to scream

00:56:53.462 --> 00:56:58.472
at you, has to shout at you, he has to jump on it, otherwise you cannot enjoy.

00:56:58.592 --> 00:57:04.302
Then it has to be worse and worse and worse and worse…

00:57:04.422 --> 00:57:09.942
I don’t know now with cracks, later on they might develop something even more poisonous,

00:57:10.062 --> 00:57:16.832
because it has to excite this limbic area which is such an important thing.

00:57:16.952 --> 00:57:26.542
But as soon as the Kundalini enters into that area, limbic area, she soothes it and it opens

00:57:26.662 --> 00:57:33.562
- opens like a lotus, thousand petalled lotus.

00:57:33.682 --> 00:57:43.812
It opens and then the Kundalini emerges out of your fontanelle bone area and gets connected

00:57:43.932 --> 00:57:45.532
to the all-pervading power.

00:57:45.652 --> 00:57:49.232
Then you start feeling the cool breeze in your hands.

00:57:49.352 --> 00:57:51.832
You can feel it all over.

00:57:51.952 --> 00:57:56.742
Some people in the beginning who felt cool breeze, could not believe it – so they closed

00:57:56.862 --> 00:58:01.332
doors, everything and sat down to see, still they were feeling it.

00:58:01.452 --> 00:58:08.812
But it works, works in the sense that you get empowered.

00:58:08.932 --> 00:58:16.322
You become peaceful, you become the witness, you become the wise and you become empowered

00:58:16.442 --> 00:58:23.072
that you can give realizations to others like this, that you can raise the Kundalini like

00:58:23.192 --> 00:58:26.322
this and you can establish that connection.

00:58:26.442 --> 00:58:29.162
You can do it.

00:58:29.282 --> 00:58:33.102
And this is what is your right to have it.

00:58:33.222 --> 00:58:35.202
This is what will give you meaning.

00:58:35.322 --> 00:58:42.482
Otherwise so far whatever we have been doing is very frustrating.

00:58:42.602 --> 00:58:47.932
Now yesterday I said some questions can be asked but I haven’t seen any questions whatsoever.

00:58:48.052 --> 00:58:51.462
That means you have no questions?

00:58:51.582 --> 00:59:26.822
Or there are some questions we can deal with it for about 5 minutes.

00:59:26.942 --> 00:59:33.992
There’s one there, please..

00:59:34.112 --> 00:59:55.502
Question: INAUDIBLE, but someone else (a yogi near Mother?) repeats the question:

00:59:55.622 --> 01:00:00.302
[What is the process by which you one stops thinking?]

01:00:00.422 --> 01:00:02.572
It’s very simple.

01:00:02.692 --> 01:00:10.562
When the Kundalini settles down there, what happens, as I told you, there is Christ – Christ

01:00:10.682 --> 01:00:18.722
is awakened and He sucks in these two institutions which you see there, the yellow and the blue.

01:00:18.842 --> 01:00:25.632
These are – one is, the blue one is our conditioning and the yellow one is our ego.

01:00:25.752 --> 01:00:29.422
So both these are sucked in like that.

01:00:29.542 --> 01:00:37.342
These are sucked in because it is said that He died for our sins, didn’t He?

01:00:37.462 --> 01:00:38.342
He suffered for us.

01:00:38.462 --> 01:00:43.312
Now also that’s why yesterday I’ve said are we going to suffer more than Him?

01:00:43.432 --> 01:00:45.602
We don’t have to suffer.

01:00:45.722 --> 01:00:48.062
Only awaken Him at Agnya.

01:00:48.182 --> 01:00:52.152
We are all right, this is the process, it opens out.

01:00:52.272 --> 01:00:54.172
All right?

01:00:54.292 --> 01:01:01.652
That’s why I said you must forgive, because He said you have to forgive and when you forgive

01:01:01.772 --> 01:01:05.372
you can ask for forgiveness, that’s why we do both the things – one in the front

01:01:05.492 --> 01:01:11.262
and one in the back.

01:01:11.382 --> 01:01:12.552
Please get up.

01:01:12.672 --> 01:01:18.362
[How do you raise the Kundalini?]

01:01:18.482 --> 01:01:21.363
Automatically, I’ll tell you how.

01:01:21.483 --> 01:01:25.092
Please, you see like if you have to sprout a seed you have to just put it in the Mother

01:01:25.212 --> 01:01:26.092
Earth.

01:01:26.212 --> 01:01:27.092
How do you do it?

01:01:27.212 --> 01:01:33.652
The Mother Earth has got the capacity and the seed is built-in within it.

01:01:33.772 --> 01:01:36.772
Now it is all built-in within you, all right.

01:01:36.892 --> 01:01:42.602
And just you are here, I can raise it – anybody can raise it, those who have got the capacity

01:01:42.722 --> 01:01:46.722
– Sahaja Yogis can raise your Kundalini also.

01:01:46.842 --> 01:01:51.942
[Question from the floor, : You talk about always thinking.

01:01:52.062 --> 01:02:01.872
You talk about, like, if you think too much, you can actually create illness and the problems

01:02:01.992 --> 01:02:05.492
in your life.

01:02:05.612 --> 01:02:11.832
How do You organize Your time and Your work and everything, but You don’t think about

01:02:11.952 --> 01:02:12.832
it?]

01:02:12.952 --> 01:02:15.822
Oh, because the Divine Power does for Me.

01:02:15.942 --> 01:02:17.122
Everything is done by Divine Power.

01:02:17.242 --> 01:02:28.522
Why should I think – let it think for Me.

01:02:28.642 --> 01:02:33.862
You see I travel every day – I sleep at 2 o’clock in the night, get up about 5 o’clock

01:02:33.982 --> 01:02:38.412
in the morning and I travel everywhere.

01:02:38.532 --> 01:02:43.472
And I’m now 67 years of age, all right, so what.

01:02:43.592 --> 01:02:46.572
Divine Power is looking after Me, it’s working out everything.

01:02:46.692 --> 01:02:56.062
I am just moving about nicely enjoying everything.

01:02:56.182 --> 01:03:07.272
But you have to believe that you can get realization.

01:03:07.392 --> 01:03:11.832
You need not believe in the Divine Power, but you just first believe that you can get

01:03:11.952 --> 01:03:15.602
realization and you get it and get in connection with it.

01:03:15.722 --> 01:03:16.862
It just works.

01:03:16.982 --> 01:03:18.882
It is the subtlest of subtle.

01:03:19.002 --> 01:03:28.602
[Yogi, repeating the question: How can we utilize the divine power in our relationships

01:03:28.722 --> 01:03:31.382
and all the problems?]

01:03:31.502 --> 01:03:37.052
You see first of all you have to give to others.

01:03:37.172 --> 01:03:42.402
Unless and until you open one door, all right that’s Divine Power there.

01:03:42.522 --> 01:03:46.542
But unless and until you open other door, it won’t come in your life.

01:03:46.662 --> 01:03:49.162
So you have to open the other door also.

01:03:49.282 --> 01:03:55.352
There’s where we fail, we want to use Sahaja Yoga for our own purpose, for our own – my

01:03:55.472 --> 01:04:02.542
brother, my sister, my son, all sorts of my, my, my…

01:04:02.662 --> 01:04:07.122
There there’s problem – but open it out.

01:04:07.242 --> 01:04:09.092
Everything works out.

01:04:09.212 --> 01:04:15.272
You must learn to give.

01:04:15.392 --> 01:04:19.012
This is free.

01:04:19.132 --> 01:04:26.222
[Question inaudible]

01:04:26.342 --> 01:04:31.232
It is situated on top of the brain where it is above the brain, and it is covered with,

01:04:31.352 --> 01:04:41.192
the doctors say that it is 988 nerves - because I don’t want to quarrel with them.

01:04:41.312 --> 01:04:44.892
But there are 1000 nerves which cover it.

01:04:45.012 --> 01:04:52.792
And when it is enlightened you’ll be surprised, you’ll see a beautiful lotus opening in

01:04:52.912 --> 01:05:08.612
all colors, very very silent flames, and they are so peace-giving, looks so beautiful.

01:05:08.732 --> 01:05:17.752
Because when any nerve gets enlightened, the light of that flame looks like a petal.

01:05:17.872 --> 01:05:20.612
It’s very beautiful, it is.

01:05:20.732 --> 01:05:22.882
But it has to open out.

01:05:23.002 --> 01:05:26.382
Just now it is covered by our conditioning and our ego.

01:05:26.502 --> 01:05:29.991
Like we have become like an egg we can say.

01:05:30.111 --> 01:05:35.052
That’s why in Sanskrit language, a person who has known the brahma, the all-pervading

01:05:35.172 --> 01:05:45.872
power, is called as dvijaha and a bird is also called as dvijaha - means born twice.

01:05:45.992 --> 01:06:21.992
First as an egg, then it becomes a bird – human being and a realized soul.

01:06:22.112 --> 01:06:59.572
These are the two stages.

01:06:59.692 --> 01:07:02.142
[Question inaudible]

01:07:02.262 --> 01:07:09.312
You see the thing is that now there are social conditions which are very bad, people are

01:07:09.432 --> 01:07:11.212
homeless, they are on the streets.

01:07:11.332 --> 01:07:16.822
Now thinking about it you are not going to help them, are you?

01:07:16.942 --> 01:07:17.822
No.

01:07:17.942 --> 01:07:22.212
Which is the best way is to empower yourself, all right?

01:07:22.332 --> 01:07:31.932
Now see for example, in the villages of India where I work, people have given them alcohol,

01:07:32.052 --> 01:07:38.122
they have given up all bad habits, they have become very dynamic, they have become very

01:07:38.242 --> 01:07:41.372
well off, they are living very well.

01:07:41.492 --> 01:07:50.122
In London, if you want to work, I am sure you can get a home, no problem.

01:07:50.242 --> 01:07:54.732
You see the Asians who have come here, I am an Asian though I didn’t come as an immigrant,

01:07:54.852 --> 01:08:02.172
they are becoming very rich, because they work very hard, very hard, so those who want

01:08:02.292 --> 01:08:03.172
to… in London.

01:08:03.292 --> 01:08:05.192
But in India it may not be.

01:08:05.312 --> 01:08:09.852
But despite that, after Sahaja Yoga they have improved so much – they have become so dynamic,

01:08:09.972 --> 01:08:13.272
they have become so hopeful of life.

01:08:13.392 --> 01:08:21.032
But if you just think that life is good for nothing, let us now drink and be merry then

01:08:21.152 --> 01:08:23.242
it won’t work out.

01:08:23.362 --> 01:08:28.082
These homeless and all these conditions are all such – because it is an artificial condition

01:08:28.202 --> 01:08:35.232
you know, many people have houses but they don’t want to give it for people to live.

01:08:35.352 --> 01:08:41.422
Now if those people get transformation, they won’t behave like that.

01:08:41.542 --> 01:08:46.672
You see the whole behavior will change when the emancipation of the society comes up.

01:08:46.792 --> 01:08:54.182
But I have seen in the villages of India there’s a complete transformation.

01:08:54.302 --> 01:09:00.222
The social conditions are much worse but Indians are more satisfied people, they are not so

01:09:00.342 --> 01:09:01.222
much.

01:09:01.342 --> 01:09:07.182
Here even, supposing you offer a house, they will say, “No, I don’t like this house.”

01:09:07.302 --> 01:09:09.812
You offer a job, they’ll say, “I don’t want this job.”

01:09:09.932 --> 01:09:14.162
All these things are there – also too much of choices.

01:09:14.282 --> 01:09:19.922
But if you decide, London is not difficult place I tell you to work hard and get a house,

01:09:20.042 --> 01:09:22.262
not difficult, they can do it.

01:09:22.382 --> 01:09:27.572
But people don’t work here, don’t work.

01:09:27.692 --> 01:09:32.472
There are so many old people who haven’t got anybody to help them.

01:09:32.592 --> 01:09:35.902
But these people will never go and help them.

01:09:36.022 --> 01:09:37.212
They can earn.

01:09:37.332 --> 01:09:42.432
This is a place where anybody can earn I think, because I know people, Asians, who have come

01:09:42.552 --> 01:09:48.751
here without any money are very rich today - all have got big big cars, nice houses,

01:09:48.871 --> 01:09:49.751
this, that.

01:09:49.871 --> 01:09:52.112
You can see that they are very hardworking.

01:09:52.232 --> 01:09:57.852
And then divorces, everybody third day if you divorce someone what will happen to you?

01:09:57.972 --> 01:09:59.942
You’ll end up without a home.

01:10:00.062 --> 01:10:04.042
No respect for the wife, the wife has no respect for the house.

01:10:04.162 --> 01:10:06.262
All upside down society.

01:10:06.382 --> 01:10:12.232
There’s a big quarrel going on between husband and wife – how can you have a home with

01:10:12.352 --> 01:10:14.062
this husband and wife fighting?

01:10:14.182 --> 01:10:18.872
Even TV if you open, nothing but fighting - you just don’t want to hear anyone.

01:10:18.992 --> 01:10:25.802
See we had to decide on certain things – that if we have to make a home, then we have to

01:10:25.922 --> 01:10:27.802
understand our role in life.

01:10:27.922 --> 01:10:34.322
For a woman and a man, I agree, they are equal, no doubt.

01:10:34.442 --> 01:10:41.802
But they are like two wheels of a chariot which has some distance but they are not similar.

01:10:41.922 --> 01:10:46.102
And no use fighting with each other – when you can’t live without each other, why should

01:10:46.222 --> 01:10:47.102
you fight?

01:10:47.222 --> 01:10:49.232
And the children are on the streets.

01:10:49.352 --> 01:10:54.602
Every child I find 18 years of age is out of the house.

01:10:54.722 --> 01:10:58.001
I mean here the little children are killed – why?

01:10:58.121 --> 01:11:02.152
In India, I cannot think of such a thing.

01:11:02.272 --> 01:11:11.152
The reason, though they are very poor, the reason is they know what is love.

01:11:11.272 --> 01:11:16.491
And that is what I feel that the society has to little bit take to Sahaja Yoga.

01:11:16.611 --> 01:11:22.382
Now we have so many marriages in Sahaja Yoga – I mean 1% marriages fail, 1%.

01:11:22.502 --> 01:11:26.632
They have beautiful children, they are living very well, they have good houses.

01:11:26.752 --> 01:11:32.172
Those who were really hippies had nothing, are having nice houses and everything they

01:11:32.292 --> 01:11:33.842
have.

01:11:33.962 --> 01:11:41.512
Also some of them, were “Oh, so I am now fortunately, I am without job.”

01:11:41.632 --> 01:11:44.692
And I said, “What, you are very fortunate?”

01:11:44.812 --> 01:11:47.001
“Yea, now I am without job.

01:11:47.121 --> 01:11:49.491
Very happy about it.”

01:11:49.611 --> 01:11:55.501
So I told the gentleman that if you are not going to stick to one job, you are not going

01:11:55.621 --> 01:11:58.672
to come to Sahaja Yoga.

01:11:58.792 --> 01:12:07.652
And that fellow today has a big car, a nice wife, children and a house.

01:12:07.772 --> 01:12:16.482
So all these ideas of stupid freedom must be given up.

01:12:16.602 --> 01:12:19.972
One has to come to a balance and value your life.

01:12:20.092 --> 01:12:24.402
You must value it.

01:12:24.522 --> 01:12:26.112
Human life is very valuable.

01:12:26.232 --> 01:12:42.842
With what great difficulty God has created you and what are we doing with it?

01:12:42.962 --> 01:12:51.722
The whole society has to take a turn and think of living happily – if the husband and wife,

01:12:51.842 --> 01:13:00.602
I mean such a relationship, husband and wife cannot live together, then how do we expect

01:13:00.722 --> 01:13:03.122
this world to have United Nations?

01:13:03.242 --> 01:13:06.802
We cannot – it is falsehood.

01:13:06.922 --> 01:13:20.832
In Sahaja Yoga we don’t have divorces – we have sometimes, sometimes we have, is allowed.

01:13:20.952 --> 01:13:25.952
But that is mostly when they are married beforehand – fallen in love, now they are rising in

01:13:26.072 --> 01:13:29.751
love, falling in love again, again falling, rising in love again… how many times they

01:13:29.871 --> 01:13:31.482
fall in love God only knows.

01:13:31.602 --> 01:13:36.012
It’s a funny stuff going on.

01:13:36.132 --> 01:13:42.232
We have to face the reality.

01:13:42.352 --> 01:13:47.251
So just worrying about these things, what we should do, is to first of all become wise

01:13:47.371 --> 01:13:49.062
and understand the problems.

01:13:49.182 --> 01:13:52.832
We can all solve it.

01:13:52.952 --> 01:13:57.712
It is very simple, it is very simple to solve the problems.

01:13:57.832 --> 01:14:03.052
First of all we have to enter into the Kingdom of God.

01:14:03.172 --> 01:14:09.972
And secondly, that it solves your problems.

01:14:10.092 --> 01:14:15.481
Just worrying about poor people, it’s also a kind of a fashion these days.

01:14:15.601 --> 01:14:18.372
Because when I went to Switzerland, I met a lady.

01:14:18.492 --> 01:14:20.352
She said, “I am very guilty.”

01:14:20.472 --> 01:14:21.352
I said, “Why?”

01:14:21.472 --> 01:14:22.352
“Because of Afghanistan.”

01:14:22.472 --> 01:14:23.352
I said, “Are you Afghani?”

01:14:23.472 --> 01:14:26.042
“No, but I am guilty about Afghanistan.”

01:14:26.162 --> 01:14:30.382
“What have you got to do with Afghanistan?”

01:14:30.502 --> 01:14:31.382
“Nothing.”

01:14:31.502 --> 01:14:36.022
So it’s kind of an idea - what are we doing about it?

01:14:36.142 --> 01:14:51.012
But a Sahaja Yogi does, Sahaja Yogi finds out ways and methods of creating a convenient

01:14:51.132 --> 01:14:56.802
life – a life where you can earn, you can live… we do it – we have done, I have

01:14:56.922 --> 01:15:03.402
so many examples.

01:15:03.522 --> 01:15:06.592
Because it’s a collective life also you help each other.

01:15:06.712 --> 01:15:13.322
We didn’t have rich people in Sahaja Yoga many because they seldom come to Sahaja Yoga.

01:15:13.442 --> 01:15:18.182
They go to false gurus because they can purchase the guru – they can’t purchase Me.

01:15:18.302 --> 01:15:22.052
So mostly the rich never come here.

01:15:22.172 --> 01:15:26.022
Bureaucrats also don’t come, politicians don’t come.

01:15:26.142 --> 01:15:32.372
So those people who come to Me are the people who can easily solve the problem because they

01:15:32.492 --> 01:15:40.692
are so collective, they can solve the problem.

01:15:40.812 --> 01:15:49.812
You’ll be surprised, I went to Turkey – My husband was not so for it – everybody said,

01:15:49.932 --> 01:15:52.002
“That’s a Muslim country, this, that.”

01:15:52.122 --> 01:16:00.842
I went to a Muslim country that was Turkey, and a woman, I just said I must go.

01:16:00.962 --> 01:16:05.414
But I was surprised, they worshipped Mother, they worshipped their mothers.

01:16:05.534 --> 01:16:09.532
And they were so beautiful – so many.

01:16:09.652 --> 01:16:15.132
In one shot, we got 70 people – serious Sahaja Yogis.

01:16:15.252 --> 01:16:20.882
But do you know when I reached there, people from America, from Australia, from all over

01:16:21.002 --> 01:16:25.552
the world arrived there in Turkey to help Me.

01:16:25.672 --> 01:16:31.802
I mean I was so enamored to see My children coming, arriving there on their own - those

01:16:31.922 --> 01:16:34.022
who could afford it.

01:16:34.142 --> 01:16:37.842
And the Turkish people were so beautiful, I tell you.

01:16:37.962 --> 01:16:41.882
I found they are the same everywhere.

01:16:42.002 --> 01:16:50.632
There’s only a skin deep difference, I tell you, otherwise we are just the same.

01:16:50.752 --> 01:17:04.882
So all these problems can be easily solved – there’s nothing so serious about it.

01:17:05.002 --> 01:17:33.532
There is

01:17:33.652 --> 01:17:49.152
a very great thing no doubt, but unless and until you are connected, it is like telephoning

01:17:49.272 --> 01:17:52.232
without connection.

01:17:52.352 --> 01:18:00.922
There are people in India who’ll go on saying “Rama Rama Rama Rama Rama” like that.

01:18:01.042 --> 01:18:04.741
And the chakra of Rama itself will be caught.

01:18:04.861 --> 01:18:10.342
They’ll be saying “Shiva Shiva Shiva Shiva” and the heart chakra, where Shiva resides,

01:18:10.462 --> 01:18:12.431
it will be caught.

01:18:12.551 --> 01:18:22.842
The reason is, supposing you want to meet the Queen – now if you go to Buckingham

01:18:22.962 --> 01:18:28.012
Palace and go on saying “Elizabeth, Elizabeth, Elizabeth” – you’ll be arrested!

01:18:28.132 --> 01:18:38.282
And you’ll end up in a jail!

01:18:38.402 --> 01:18:48.362
So you must have some connection, there should be some protocol.

01:18:48.482 --> 01:18:54.812
Now if it is for kings and prime ministers, what about God?

01:18:54.932 --> 01:18:59.742
He’s not in your pocket.

01:18:59.862 --> 01:19:03.112
But once you are realized, even once you take the name, it is sufficient.

01:19:03.232 --> 01:19:04.672
What is there?

01:19:04.792 --> 01:19:07.912
He’s at your disposal all the time there.

01:19:08.032 --> 01:19:10.652
But you have to have connection.

01:19:10.772 --> 01:19:16.612
Now you are the citizens say of England, or some place, all right so your government is

01:19:16.732 --> 01:19:17.702
looking after you.

01:19:17.822 --> 01:19:20.982
Whether you are satisfied or not is not the point.

01:19:21.102 --> 01:19:22.932
But they are looking after you.

01:19:23.052 --> 01:19:30.552
But if you enter into the Kingdom of God, then see the efficiency of this Kingdom.

01:19:30.672 --> 01:19:38.382
You’ll be amazed if I tell you how things work out.

01:19:38.502 --> 01:20:14.802
So amazing

01:20:14.922 --> 01:20:20.392
it is, so amazing.

01:20:20.512 --> 01:20:26.072
See first of all they say Kundalini has to rise.

01:20:26.192 --> 01:20:33.342
Then it sometimes comes back to the centers which are needing more help.

01:20:33.462 --> 01:20:41.342
So it is like a rope you can say, which has many strings in it, very thin ones just like

01:20:41.462 --> 01:20:46.662
a hair, and one by one they open out.

01:20:46.782 --> 01:20:55.382
So first, very few of them pierce through, open out the Sahasrara, by which you relax

01:20:55.502 --> 01:20:58.002
and the chakras open out more.

01:20:58.122 --> 01:21:00.572
It goes on like that.

01:21:00.692 --> 01:21:08.242
But once you are connected properly then there’s no problem.

01:21:08.362 --> 01:21:12.722
But it is instantaneous, no doubt about it.

01:21:12.842 --> 01:21:19.242
But for that you have to come to our centers, don’t have to pay anything, just spend some

01:21:19.362 --> 01:21:25.832
time and you have to master it, that’s all.

01:21:25.952 --> 01:21:34.352
There’s a question, what purpose do we have on this planet?

01:21:34.472 --> 01:21:48.672
The purpose of our existence is to prove that God’s creation is the most successful thing.

01:21:48.792 --> 01:21:53.202
That’s the purpose.

01:21:53.322 --> 01:22:14.851
About Me, I will not talk - I am sorry.

01:22:14.971 --> 01:22:19.902
You better get your realization and try to find out about Me, because those who have

01:22:20.022 --> 01:22:23.871
talked - you see human beings are mad people, you don’t know.

01:22:23.991 --> 01:22:28.632
Christ said “I am the Son of God” – which He was no doubt.

01:22:28.752 --> 01:22:33.802
And He saidthat, “I am the door” – which He was, no doubt.

01:22:33.922 --> 01:22:35.012
But they crucified Him.

01:22:35.132 --> 01:22:38.232
They gave poison to Mohammed Sahib.

01:22:38.352 --> 01:22:40.532
They killed so many saints.

01:22:40.652 --> 01:22:45.742
I know human beings very well, so please I am not going to talk to you about Myself at

01:22:45.862 --> 01:22:46.802
all.

01:22:46.922 --> 01:22:52.121
You better get your self-realization - try to know Me.

01:22:52.241 --> 01:23:00.622
Because I have to do some jobs, all right and for that, I want to live.

01:23:00.742 --> 01:23:04.132
People are really sometimes so funny.

01:23:04.252 --> 01:23:09.762
Even otherwise they behave in such a funny manner that I can’t understand.

01:23:09.882 --> 01:23:14.342
As if I am going to take away their property or something.

01:23:14.462 --> 01:23:21.342
I am here to give you something that is very important.

01:23:21.462 --> 01:23:41.822
Sort of you can say I am here to complete the work of Christ, Mohammed and all of them.

01:23:41.942 --> 01:23:58.712
Yes please….

01:23:58.832 --> 01:24:09.932
When you will give to others, you will receive the blessings.

01:24:10.052 --> 01:24:13.492
That’s what it is absolutely 100%.

01:24:13.612 --> 01:24:16.492
He said so many things.

01:24:16.612 --> 01:24:23.952
I mean just explaining Sahaja Yoga throughout I think.

01:24:24.072 --> 01:24:34.742
[Question inaudible]

01:24:34.862 --> 01:24:48.702
That

01:24:48.822 --> 01:24:51.812
should not be the question just now, all right.

01:24:51.932 --> 01:24:55.822
Because to say anything about it, you know what happens with people.

01:24:55.942 --> 01:25:02.952
So this can be discussed later on, when we get our self-realization.

01:25:03.072 --> 01:25:10.292
Certain things at a level can be discussed and this is what happened with all of them

01:25:10.412 --> 01:25:16.032
because they had very little time to talk to you.

01:25:16.152 --> 01:25:26.922
And that’s why everything has been misinterpreted, misused, because to understand the truth,

01:25:27.042 --> 01:25:32.842
to bear it also, one has to have self-realization.

01:25:32.962 --> 01:25:34.582
This I have found out.

01:25:34.702 --> 01:25:40.592
If you are not a self realized person you can’t bear the truth, you cannot – it’s

01:25:40.712 --> 01:25:53.662
too much for human mind to grasp and to allow it to be a part and parcel of their understanding.

01:25:53.782 --> 01:25:56.982
Truth is too much for them.

01:25:57.102 --> 01:26:00.702
So the first thing should be that we get our self-realization.

01:26:00.822 --> 01:26:02.502
Yes, my child…

01:26:02.622 --> 01:26:04.302
[Initial question inaudible.

01:26:04.422 --> 01:26:09.942
Mother: Can you get up, please?

01:26:10.062 --> 01:26:16.472
Questioner: Yes, of course

01:26:16.592 --> 01:26:21.371
Mother: Thank you.

01:26:21.491 --> 01:26:34.062
Questioner: Do the colors of the chakras change all the time?[…

01:26:34.182 --> 01:26:35.632
INAUDIBLE]

01:26:35.752 --> 01:26:39.862
But the auras you see sometimes are these colors only.

01:26:39.982 --> 01:26:44.132
But sometimes you are more strong with one center, so that color shows.

01:26:44.252 --> 01:26:51.121
They do not change, they are just the same.

01:26:51.241 --> 01:26:55.822
All right I think now it is 10 o’clock so we’ll take about 10 minutes more and let

01:26:55.942 --> 01:27:02.502
us finish with our self-realization which is going to take only 10 minutes.

01:27:02.622 --> 01:27:08.462
Those who do not want to have should please leave, they should not sit here and just watch

01:27:08.582 --> 01:27:09.562
other people.

01:27:09.682 --> 01:27:16.042
That’s the only kindness I request of them – that if you do not want to have self-realization,

01:27:16.162 --> 01:27:19.492
it’s better that you should leave.

01:27:19.612 --> 01:27:25.002
Those people who are standing, could not get place, can come here or you can also give

01:27:25.122 --> 01:27:29.112
them places if you want to give some places.

01:27:29.232 --> 01:27:34.342
No, not for Sahaja Yogis, I said for others – for others, for outsiders, Sahaja Yogis

01:27:34.462 --> 01:27:35.502
can stand up.

01:27:35.622 --> 01:28:18.622
At the very outset you have to now understand that we are going to enter into the Kingdom

01:28:18.742 --> 01:28:29.271
of God and hence we have to little bit unload ourselves.

01:28:29.391 --> 01:28:42.532
One of the conditions is that we should not feel guilty – one should not feel guilty

01:28:42.652 --> 01:28:43.532
at all.

01:28:43.652 --> 01:28:47.082
Yesterday, same problem I said, but you were still feeling guilty.

01:28:47.202 --> 01:28:48.632
Also it’s a fashion.

01:28:48.752 --> 01:28:53.082
Also I think the language is such – all the time sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry…

01:28:53.202 --> 01:28:57.922
Even when we used to receive telephones we used to say “I beg your pardon.”

01:28:58.042 --> 01:29:00.582
But now it is sorry, sorry, sorry – ten times sorry.

01:29:00.702 --> 01:29:05.882
What is there to be so sorry?

01:29:06.002 --> 01:29:08.802
So we have to be pleasantly placed towards ourselves.

01:29:08.922 --> 01:29:10.592
We have to respect ourselves.

01:29:10.712 --> 01:29:13.672
We have to be happy about ourselves.

01:29:13.792 --> 01:29:21.402
This is first thing is not to feel guilty about anything - just believe that you have

01:29:21.522 --> 01:29:28.532
done nothing wrong which cannot be dissolved by this great power of forgiveness.

01:29:28.652 --> 01:29:32.122
Please believe Me.

01:29:32.242 --> 01:29:38.322
But if you want to stick onto a feeling like that – “No, no, I am guilty” – it’s

01:29:38.442 --> 01:29:39.472
only mental.

01:29:39.592 --> 01:29:46.972
Animals don’t feel guilty about anything – a dog will bark, tiger will eat anything

01:29:47.092 --> 01:29:48.592
that it wants to.

01:29:48.712 --> 01:29:52.972
It’s only human beings who feel that way – that I’ve done this wrong, I’ve done

01:29:53.092 --> 01:29:53.972
that wrong.

01:29:54.092 --> 01:29:59.282
All right, so not to feel guilty that’s one point.

01:29:59.402 --> 01:30:10.802
The second one is to forgive everyone, which is very difficult for many people.

01:30:10.922 --> 01:30:18.052
I don’t know how many mounds of unhappiness is in the head because we cannot forgive.

01:30:18.172 --> 01:30:23.162
Mounds, it’s not kilos and kilos.

01:30:23.282 --> 01:30:31.932
Yesterday I found most of them had not forgiven and I had to go on putting balm on their heads

01:30:32.052 --> 01:30:33.652
to take out.

01:30:33.772 --> 01:30:36.342
So you must cooperate.

01:30:36.462 --> 01:30:40.922
Just forgive, just forgive everyone.

01:30:41.042 --> 01:30:44.932
First of all forgive yourself and forgive everyone.

01:30:45.052 --> 01:30:50.452
And be pleasantly placed towards yourself.

01:30:50.572 --> 01:30:53.592
There’s no Greek tragedy going on here – no tragedy.

01:30:53.712 --> 01:31:04.292
We are in a very beautiful atmosphere and we are going to go into the most beautiful

01:31:04.412 --> 01:31:08.182
area within ourselves, that is our spirit.

01:31:08.302 --> 01:31:13.402
So we have to be very light about it.

01:31:13.522 --> 01:31:22.712
All right, with all this understanding, I have to request you that we have to take out

01:31:22.832 --> 01:31:30.081
your shoes because this Mother Earth also helps us a lot.

01:31:30.201 --> 01:31:50.792
And not to be serious – not to be serious about it.

01:31:50.912 --> 01:32:04.612
It’s not frivolous, but it’s fun.

01:32:04.732 --> 01:32:22.882
So you have to put your left hand towards Me, which represents your desire to get realization.

01:32:23.002 --> 01:32:29.572
If all the Sahaja Yogis could also sit down it would be very nice.

01:32:29.692 --> 01:32:32.862
Please be seated and don’t move about.

01:32:32.982 --> 01:32:39.132
Left hand towards Me like that – be comfortable, if you want you can put it on your lap or

01:32:39.252 --> 01:32:41.112
you can put it up if you want to.

01:32:41.232 --> 01:32:54.092
Then the right hand needs to be used for nourishing your centers on the left-hand side.

01:32:54.212 --> 01:32:58.412
Now I’ll show you how we’ll be nourishing.

01:32:58.532 --> 01:33:02.972
Before that, please remember that put your both the feet apart from each other – not

01:33:03.092 --> 01:33:06.842
too much, but slightly.

01:33:06.962 --> 01:33:12.962
Now, left hand towards Me.

01:33:13.082 --> 01:33:20.232
I’ll show you before and then we can close our eyes and work it out.

01:33:20.352 --> 01:33:33.072
Put your right hand on your heart – in the heart resides the Spirit and Kundalini is

01:33:33.192 --> 01:33:41.302
the reflection of the Holy Ghost, of the Adi Shakti, within us, while the Spirit is the

01:33:41.422 --> 01:33:46.331
reflection of God Almighty.

01:33:46.451 --> 01:33:54.152
So we put our attention to our heart first.

01:33:54.272 --> 01:34:02.132
Then we take our right hand in the upper portion of our abdomen on the left-hand side and press

01:34:02.252 --> 01:34:03.442
it hard.

01:34:03.562 --> 01:34:07.802
This is the center of our mastery.

01:34:07.922 --> 01:34:16.842
We take down our right hand on the lower portion of our abdomen and press it hard.

01:34:16.962 --> 01:34:28.362
This is the center of pure knowledge that manifests on our central nervous system.

01:34:28.482 --> 01:34:38.032
We take back our hand in the upper portion of our abdomen.

01:34:38.152 --> 01:34:46.932
And again we take it in the heart, in the upper portion of our heart.

01:34:47.052 --> 01:34:55.963
Then we take it in the corner of our neck and our shoulder and put your head to the

01:34:56.083 --> 01:34:58.642
right.

01:34:58.762 --> 01:35:07.702
This is the center we catch when we feel guilty.

01:35:07.822 --> 01:35:22.362
Then we take our hand on our forehead and slowly bring down our head on it to rest.

01:35:22.482 --> 01:35:33.472
Here we press it on both the sides and this is the center to forgive.

01:35:33.592 --> 01:35:47.282
We take back our hand on the back side of our head and put our head resting on it - this

01:35:47.402 --> 01:35:53.132
is the center for asking forgiveness without feeling guilty.

01:35:53.252 --> 01:36:03.402
We stretch our hand, with the center of our palm, we put it on our head in the soft bone

01:36:03.522 --> 01:36:12.172
area of our childhood, called as fontanelle bone area, and slowly we put down our head.

01:36:12.292 --> 01:36:27.302
Here we stretch our fingers and move our scalp carefully with pressure, slowly, clockwise,

01:36:27.422 --> 01:36:33.262
seven times.

01:36:33.382 --> 01:36:51.802
That’s all we have to do.

01:36:51.922 --> 01:37:00.442
Now please close your eyes and don’t open them until I ask you to open because attention

01:37:00.562 --> 01:37:02.202
has to go inside.

01:37:02.322 --> 01:37:04.932
Put your left hand towards Me.

01:37:05.052 --> 01:37:10.142
Now first you will feel thoughtless – so don’t fight with your thoughts.

01:37:10.262 --> 01:37:12.322
Automatically everything will work out.

01:37:12.442 --> 01:37:20.552
Don’t fight with your thoughts, just keep watching and ultimately you will feel cool

01:37:20.672 --> 01:37:25.562
breeze coming out of your fontanelle bone area and you’ll also start feeling cool

01:37:25.682 --> 01:37:32.082
breeze all around you which is the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost, the cool breeze of the

01:37:32.202 --> 01:37:42.282
all-pervading power as described by Adi Shankaracharya, Salilam, salilam – it’s cool, and cool.

01:37:42.402 --> 01:37:55.302
So now, we put our left hand this way towards Me and the right hand on the heart.

01:37:55.422 --> 01:38:04.682
Here you have to ask Me a very fundamental question, three times – “Mother, am I

01:38:04.802 --> 01:38:06.382
the Spirit?”

01:38:06.502 --> 01:38:15.382
In your heart, ask the question “Mother, am I the Spirit?”

01:38:15.502 --> 01:38:27.002
If you are the spirit you are your master, because in the light of your spirit you know

01:38:27.122 --> 01:38:31.612
what is right and what is wrong – you can guide yourself.

01:38:31.732 --> 01:38:38.392
So put your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side, and

01:38:38.512 --> 01:38:49.182
here please ask Me a question again three times – “Mother, am I my own master?”

01:38:49.302 --> 01:38:58.682
“Mother, am I my own master?”

01:38:58.802 --> 01:39:09.642
As I have told you that I will not cross your freedom, I respect your freedom, and only

01:39:09.762 --> 01:39:19.522
if you want I can bestow this pure knowledge on yourself, otherwise I cannot.

01:39:19.642 --> 01:39:27.442
So please put your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen and ask the question,

01:39:27.562 --> 01:39:42.172
“Mother” - or you can request “Mother please give me pure knowledge.”

01:39:42.292 --> 01:39:50.442
Say this six times because this center has got six petals.

01:39:50.562 --> 01:40:02.712
“Mother, please give me pure knowledge.”

01:40:02.832 --> 01:40:14.992
Now all the prophets of the past and the saints and seers have built up for us a center of

01:40:15.112 --> 01:40:17.182
mastery.

01:40:17.302 --> 01:40:27.722
But to open the center we have to have all the confidence, so please raise your hand

01:40:27.842 --> 01:40:39.351
and put it in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side and say with full confidence

01:40:39.471 --> 01:40:52.692
to nourish this center, ten times, “Mother, I am my own master.”

01:40:52.812 --> 01:41:05.562
Please say this ten times.

01:41:05.682 --> 01:41:18.972
Now we have to know that we are not this body, we are not this mind, we are not these emotions,

01:41:19.092 --> 01:41:23.782
we are not this intellect.

01:41:23.902 --> 01:41:28.592
We are not our conditionings or are we our ego.

01:41:28.712 --> 01:41:33.042
We are pure spirit.

01:41:33.162 --> 01:41:42.642
So now raise your hand to your heart and with full confidence say twelve times “Mother,

01:41:42.762 --> 01:41:44.712
I am the spirit.”

01:41:44.832 --> 01:41:54.592
Please say twelve times, “Mother, I am the spirit.”

01:41:54.712 --> 01:42:08.432
You have to know that this Divine Power is the ocean of love and compassion.

01:42:08.552 --> 01:42:19.272
It is the ocean of joy and bliss but above all it is the ocean of forgiveness, so there

01:42:19.392 --> 01:42:28.351
is no mistake that you have committed which cannot be dissolved by this ocean.

01:42:28.471 --> 01:42:38.522
So please forgive yourself and put your right hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder

01:42:38.642 --> 01:42:42.722
and turn your head to your right.

01:42:42.842 --> 01:42:57.422
Here you have to say with complete confidence again, “Shri Mataji, I am not guilty at

01:42:57.542 --> 01:42:58.422
all.”

01:42:58.542 --> 01:43:17.002
Or you can call Me Mother – “Mother, I am not guilty at all.”

01:43:17.122 --> 01:43:32.442
Sixteen times- please say this sixteen times.

01:43:32.562 --> 01:43:45.682
Now one has to know whether you forgive someone or don’t forgive, you don’t do anything

01:43:45.802 --> 01:43:47.862
– it’s a myth.

01:43:47.982 --> 01:43:52.612
But if you don’t forgive, then you play into wrong hands.

01:43:52.732 --> 01:44:04.372
So put your right hand on your forehead and please bend your head, resting on the hand

01:44:04.492 --> 01:44:10.542
as much as you can and now press it on both the sides.

01:44:10.662 --> 01:44:19.262
And here please, please, say it from your heart “Mother, I forgive everyone.”

01:44:19.382 --> 01:44:28.121
Please say it from your heart - please say it, otherwise again I will have to work very

01:44:28.241 --> 01:44:29.162
hard on you.

01:44:29.282 --> 01:44:34.262
So please say it from your heart – “Mother, I forgive everyone.”

01:44:34.382 --> 01:44:41.552
You are not going to miss your self-realization for not forgiving, please.

01:44:41.672 --> 01:44:57.262
How many lives you have been seeking the truth that this time you are not going to miss it

01:44:57.382 --> 01:44:58.262
out.

01:44:58.382 --> 01:45:51.702
Now take back your hand on the back side of your head and push back

01:45:51.822 --> 01:47:57.862
your head as much as you can resting on your

01:47:57.982 --> 01:48:28.272
hand

01:48:28.392 --> 01:48:51.952
and here for your own satisfaction, without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes,

01:48:52.072 --> 01:49:10.632
please say, “Oh Divine, if

01:49:10.752 --> 01:49:43.042
I

01:49:43.162 --> 01:50:08.121
have done any mistakes, please forgive me.”

01:50:08.241 --> 01:50:26.962
TAPE ENDS
