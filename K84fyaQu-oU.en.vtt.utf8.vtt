00:00.940 --> 00:16.449
[Music]

00:18.440 --> 00:23.039
in the morning time you have to give

00:20.970 --> 00:27.050
yourself abundant when you are going out

00:23.039 --> 00:30.360
don't go out without giving a button and

00:27.050 --> 00:32.460
attention should be all the time inside

00:30.360 --> 00:34.710
in the sense that walking on the road

00:32.460 --> 00:36.989
people have habit of seeing they sing

00:34.710 --> 00:39.239
that sing like that the attention gets

00:36.989 --> 00:41.190
written away what you should do is to

00:39.239 --> 00:43.830
see about three feet or 4 feet at the

00:41.190 --> 00:45.510
most on the ground and not about because

00:43.830 --> 00:48.870
you guys you are the beautiful children

00:45.510 --> 00:52.049
flowers everything there's nothing very

00:48.870 --> 00:55.170
beautiful about that so better is to see

00:52.049 --> 00:57.600
only up 3-4 feet if possible to fix your

00:55.170 --> 01:00.839
attention so the attention becomes

00:57.600 --> 01:03.809
concentrated and you feel very relaxed

01:00.839 --> 01:22.619
and relieved of too much of wobbling of

01:03.809 --> 01:24.960
your eyes attention you see your

01:22.619 --> 01:26.880
attention get spoiled that when you put

01:24.960 --> 01:29.460
attention say I put attention onto this

01:26.880 --> 01:31.920
glass then I start thinking about this

01:29.460 --> 01:34.979
glass that always a beautiful glass so

01:31.920 --> 01:37.799
now this is a very beautifully done one

01:34.979 --> 01:40.670
now somehow or other I should manage to

01:37.799 --> 01:40.670
steal it

01:52.260 --> 02:00.660
then attention when attention moves

01:56.190 --> 02:02.440
further how can I manage to steal this

02:00.660 --> 02:05.470
what should I do

02:02.440 --> 02:07.150
what is the best way of stealing it and

02:05.470 --> 02:10.270
all those things so that tension gauge

02:07.150 --> 02:15.070
DC into problems and problems because I

02:10.270 --> 02:20.740
have got for disagreed I develop how I

02:15.070 --> 02:23.380
developed because I see supposing I put

02:20.740 --> 02:24.910
my attention to it and then a thought

02:23.380 --> 02:27.370
starts from there coming to me a

02:24.910 --> 02:29.380
reaction as as such this gives you a

02:27.370 --> 02:31.810
reaction then you start seeing a

02:29.380 --> 02:34.180
beautiful Ganesha there then you say oh

02:31.810 --> 02:35.830
I have never seen one like this like

02:34.180 --> 02:38.500
that the thought starts to see coming

02:35.830 --> 02:41.620
from all this and that thought comes

02:38.500 --> 02:43.180
into my mind and gives me ideas that I

02:41.620 --> 02:46.240
should do something like that

02:43.180 --> 02:48.190
to steal the glass all right now the

02:46.240 --> 02:52.269
pure attention would be that I just

02:48.190 --> 02:55.150
watch this without thinking anywhere

02:52.269 --> 02:59.400
that your attention goes and you start

02:55.150 --> 03:03.220
sort of getting involved into it or

02:59.400 --> 03:07.150
getting attached to it you should try to

03:03.220 --> 03:09.220
just watch it without thinking go into

03:07.150 --> 03:11.769
thoughtless order then you enjoyed the

03:09.220 --> 03:16.930
most now say for example these carpets

03:11.769 --> 03:18.610
are very nice one thing would be if they

03:16.930 --> 03:20.590
belong to me I would be worried how to

03:18.610 --> 03:22.540
insure them these people are sitting

03:20.590 --> 03:24.299
that should be spoiled is that all these

03:22.540 --> 03:26.500
thoughts will come into mind

03:24.299 --> 03:30.160
supposing these belong to you then I'll

03:26.500 --> 03:32.760
think how to manage to take them with me

03:30.160 --> 03:32.760
somehow

03:39.049 --> 03:44.430
and how to suggest in a very clever way

03:42.299 --> 03:50.939
some things that I can manage to take

03:44.430 --> 03:55.220
them away now that is that is quite

03:50.939 --> 03:58.760
human then one can do that way but

03:55.220 --> 04:02.340
beyond that all flow earnest and cunning

03:58.760 --> 04:06.209
best is to appreciate how by just

04:02.340 --> 04:08.489
looking at it without any thought artist

04:06.209 --> 04:11.879
has created it he has put all his joy

04:08.489 --> 04:14.609
into it I'm just enjoying the joy just

04:11.879 --> 04:17.880
looking at it so when you start enjoying

04:14.609 --> 04:22.860
the joy your attention will become pure

04:17.880 --> 04:27.449
very pure because the enjoyment of it is

04:22.860 --> 04:30.330
makes you a very sort of dedicated

04:27.449 --> 04:33.810
person about it because you feel that

04:30.330 --> 04:36.389
what is in this world after all it's to

04:33.810 --> 04:40.139
enjoy then if I have to enjoy everything

04:36.389 --> 04:43.500
that why should I worry about getting it

04:40.139 --> 04:49.530
to myself or stealing it or doing all

04:43.500 --> 04:52.440
these tricks better is to try so the

04:49.530 --> 04:57.630
reward of it is so great that attention

04:52.440 --> 05:01.440
starts purifying yourself minimum of

04:57.630 --> 05:06.050
minimum first the attention has to be

05:01.440 --> 05:08.330
pure but pure attention doesn't mean

05:06.050 --> 05:11.240
harshness

05:08.330 --> 05:14.180
it doesn't mean asceticism

05:11.240 --> 05:20.190
it doesn't mean disciplining your eyes

05:14.180 --> 05:23.909
like a blinkers of horse but in all

05:20.190 --> 05:28.500
freedom your attention to be

05:23.909 --> 05:33.510
concentrated where do we pay our

05:28.500 --> 05:37.440
attention the most if we are honest we

05:33.510 --> 05:39.710
can think on human level we pay our

05:37.440 --> 05:44.360
attention to our children

05:39.710 --> 05:52.960
to our wife our husbands to our family

05:44.360 --> 06:03.620
the relationships which are with love so

05:52.960 --> 06:10.490
when your attention has got the

06:03.620 --> 06:15.560
compassion and the love for another

06:10.490 --> 06:20.090
person then only you can work out the

06:15.560 --> 06:23.210
realization of others if you have to

06:20.090 --> 06:29.570
work out the realization of others it

06:23.210 --> 06:35.860
has to be an intense love for another

06:29.570 --> 06:39.440
person if you don't have that intensity

06:35.860 --> 06:41.480
you are just moving your hands raising

06:39.440 --> 06:44.710
the Kundalini because your mother has

06:41.480 --> 06:50.120
given you powers and finished off that

06:44.710 --> 06:54.860
intensity of love can only give you

06:50.120 --> 07:00.340
success with your pure attention and I

06:54.860 --> 07:04.160
think the pure attention can only love

07:00.340 --> 07:10.600
impure attention cannot love because all

07:04.160 --> 07:14.930
impurity is self oriented I orient it

07:10.600 --> 07:16.300
they are not self in the sense spiritual

07:14.930 --> 07:32.050
oriented

07:16.300 --> 07:32.050
[Music]

07:36.799 --> 07:45.869
what should not lose your attention

07:40.699 --> 07:48.629
which is towards God Almighty if that is

07:45.869 --> 07:52.009
lost you are lost there's a very nice

07:48.629 --> 07:56.219
poem namadeva has written about that

07:52.009 --> 07:59.909
there was a boy who was flying a kite

07:56.219 --> 08:02.309
and the kite was floating and this boy

07:59.909 --> 08:04.349
was looking after the kite and while he

08:02.309 --> 08:07.889
was talking to everybody else but his

08:04.349 --> 08:11.569
attention was on the culture then it

08:07.889 --> 08:17.429
goes further he says that a lady is

08:11.569 --> 08:20.069
having the little child on her body on

08:17.429 --> 08:25.349
the waist and she is cleaning the house

08:20.069 --> 08:28.979
she is cleaning with a little broom she

08:25.349 --> 08:30.599
has to move from here to there and after

08:28.979 --> 08:34.289
that cleaning she has to do other work

08:30.599 --> 08:36.719
also but the child is here so her

08:34.289 --> 08:38.430
attention is on the child that she

08:36.719 --> 08:41.399
should not fall down something should

08:38.430 --> 08:45.329
not happen though she is doing all kinds

08:41.399 --> 08:48.209
of work everything her attention is on

08:45.329 --> 08:50.819
the child in the same way your attention

08:48.209 --> 08:57.360
should be on your divine power of

08:50.819 --> 09:00.290
Kundalini this third one he is described

08:57.360 --> 09:04.259
that there are many ladies who are

09:00.290 --> 09:05.879
taking water from a river sometimes they

09:04.259 --> 09:09.269
have three pictures on their heads and

09:05.879 --> 09:11.759
walk and while they are walking they are

09:09.269 --> 09:14.189
talking to each other telling stories

09:11.759 --> 09:17.220
about each other anything but their

09:14.189 --> 09:19.829
attention was on the pictures which are

09:17.220 --> 09:22.949
on their head in the same way whatever

09:19.829 --> 09:27.449
we are doing our attention should be on

09:22.949 --> 09:32.550
our Kundalini we should find out what

09:27.449 --> 09:35.519
are we do as it is we have the light but

09:32.550 --> 09:42.379
you must take light into every corner of

09:35.519 --> 09:46.920
your life every aspect of your thinking

09:42.379 --> 09:50.310
every kind of an effort to me

09:46.920 --> 09:53.400
and you'll be amazed if you really watch

09:50.310 --> 09:56.820
your attention she will really know what

09:53.400 --> 10:00.870
you are doing is the attention to be

09:56.820 --> 10:05.220
watched so much that ultimately you'll

10:00.870 --> 10:07.980
be surprised that the attention is no

10:05.220 --> 10:11.460
more frittering either without the

10:07.980 --> 10:13.080
attention you cannot work out and the

10:11.460 --> 10:18.330
subject of sahaja yoga requires a

10:13.080 --> 10:19.980
maximum maximum penetration because

10:18.330 --> 10:21.240
sahaja yoga if you have understood I

10:19.980 --> 10:22.850
don't know if you have understood or you

10:21.240 --> 10:25.800
are aware of it or not

10:22.850 --> 10:32.550
but is learned through experience and

10:25.800 --> 10:34.530
through nothing else you have to

10:32.550 --> 10:36.960
experience and then believe into it it

10:34.530 --> 10:38.670
is not that what I told you is a

10:36.960 --> 10:41.430
conditioning on your mind nothing you

10:38.670 --> 10:43.740
experience it to yourself anger but

10:41.430 --> 10:45.660
those who have that penetrating

10:43.740 --> 10:49.460
intelligence who have that penetrating

10:45.660 --> 10:53.420
love emotions and those have that

10:49.460 --> 10:56.550
penetrating movement of their

10:53.420 --> 10:59.460
understanding they are the one who

10:56.550 --> 11:04.460
experience learn experience learn

10:59.460 --> 11:08.960
experience learn so this penetration

11:04.460 --> 11:11.010
starts by your meditation and

11:08.960 --> 11:14.000
sustainance of the meditation and

11:11.010 --> 11:14.000
Samadhi

11:15.529 --> 11:21.490
seed sprouting manifesting the new

11:18.889 --> 11:21.490
dimension

11:24.310 --> 11:31.120
this sort of an attention one has to

11:26.920 --> 11:32.080
develop by watching the attention

11:31.120 --> 11:34.690
chipton

11:32.080 --> 11:43.140
you had experiences of things working

11:34.690 --> 11:45.839
out you have had experiences of many of

11:43.140 --> 11:50.260
miracles happening before your eyes but

11:45.839 --> 11:53.950
still the attention has not settled down

11:50.260 --> 11:57.990
with those experiences still guitar

11:53.950 --> 12:02.290
nawaz means the old experiences continue

11:57.990 --> 12:05.140
old identifications continue still

12:02.290 --> 12:08.820
continue with that and the filth of that

12:05.140 --> 12:12.730
is still on your being change everything

12:08.820 --> 12:18.310
become a fresh new person you are

12:12.730 --> 12:22.839
blooming out as a flower and then as a

12:18.310 --> 12:30.280
tree and as you your position assume

12:22.839 --> 12:34.660
your position as they sahaja yogi so

12:30.280 --> 12:36.480
this attention must be brought round you

12:34.660 --> 12:41.850
judge yourself where is your attention

12:36.480 --> 12:45.630
and what is the point of understanding

12:41.850 --> 12:50.880
what is the measure of understanding

12:45.630 --> 12:54.780
it's very simple I have to be pleased

12:50.880 --> 12:54.780
because I am getting

12:55.580 --> 13:03.290
if I am pleased then you have got the

12:58.880 --> 13:06.260
job but I cannot be pleased by mundane

13:03.290 --> 13:09.370
things by any arguments with that but

13:06.260 --> 13:09.370
only by your assent
