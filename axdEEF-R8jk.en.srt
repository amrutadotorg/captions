00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:11,560
Today we have gathered here to do the puja of Adi Kundalini

2
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:14,720
as well as your own Kundalini.

3
00:00:22,338 --> 00:00:28,440
First of all, I think this is the most important thing to understand

4
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,269
about your own Kundalini,

5
00:00:31,294 --> 00:00:35,704
as Self-realization is Self-knowledge

6
00:00:35,821 --> 00:00:42,592
and the one who gives you Self Knowledge is this, your own Kundalini

7
00:00:42,727 --> 00:00:51,218
because, when she rises, she points it out, what are the problems on your chakras.

8
00:00:52,421 --> 00:00:56,468
Now, we say that it is pure desire,

9
00:00:57,819 --> 00:01:00,934
but we do not know what purity means.

10
00:01:01,764 --> 00:01:04,759
It means your chaste desire.

11
00:01:06,716 --> 00:01:14,016
It means it has no lust, greed, anything in it.

12
00:01:15,001 --> 00:01:21,122
That power is your own Mother and is settled in your triangular bone.

13
00:01:21,147 --> 00:01:23,280
She’s your own mother.

14
00:01:23,305 --> 00:01:26,884
She knows everything about you, it’s like a tape recorder.

15
00:01:27,021 --> 00:01:29,661
She knows everything about you

16
00:01:30,267 --> 00:01:44,661
and she is absolutely the knowledge — because she’s so pure.

17
00:01:49,635 --> 00:01:53,800
And, whatever chakras she touches,

18
00:01:54,285 --> 00:01:59,769
she also knows what's wrong with that chakra

19
00:02:00,907 --> 00:02:02,414
beforehand,

20
00:02:05,563 --> 00:02:08,304
so she's quite prepared,

21
00:02:09,091 --> 00:02:14,221
and she adjusts herself fully

22
00:02:15,979 --> 00:02:22,261
so that you do not get a problem by her awakening.

23
00:02:22,971 --> 00:02:28,261
If any chakra is constricted, she waits

24
00:02:28,301 --> 00:02:35,301
and goes on slowly opening that chakra.

25
00:02:37,981 --> 00:02:46,625
Now, this Kundalini is the primordial power which is reflected within you,

26
00:02:47,411 --> 00:02:50,798
and within you, in a human being,

27
00:02:51,484 --> 00:02:59,535
it is like many strands of energy.

28
00:03:00,445 --> 00:03:02,703
So it’s like a rope

29
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:12,537
and these energies are all twisted together to form this Kundalini.

30
00:03:14,396 --> 00:03:22,541
In a human being these strands are three into seven — that is twenty-one —

31
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:24,781
raised to power hundred and eight.

32
00:03:25,848 --> 00:03:29,288
But when your Kundalini rises,

33
00:03:29,313 --> 00:03:36,089
one or two strands out of this come up and pierce the fontanel bone area.

34
00:03:36,222 --> 00:03:37,699
Only one or two

35
00:03:40,102 --> 00:03:46,873
because it has to pass through the innermost nadi, known as Brahma Nadi.

36
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,464
It’s all a spiral throughout

37
00:03:53,301 --> 00:04:06,552
because Kundalini is a spiral and these nadis are also are like a spiral like this.

38
00:04:06,552 --> 00:04:10,832
So the innermost nadi is the Brahma Nadi.

39
00:04:12,217 --> 00:04:18,912
The outermost nadi is the right side

40
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:27,152
and the second innermost is the Ida Nadi.

41
00:04:29,288 --> 00:04:35,392
So, through the Brahma Nadi, she starts sending those threads.

42
00:04:36,077 --> 00:04:42,214
By that, they relax the center.

43
00:04:42,631 --> 00:04:45,538
By the relaxation of the center,

44
00:04:47,729 --> 00:04:53,272
the sympathetic nervous system also starts relaxing

45
00:04:54,891 --> 00:04:59,149
and when it goes to the Agnya Chakra,

46
00:04:59,835 --> 00:05:03,632
then your eyes start relaxing,

47
00:05:03,632 --> 00:05:06,552
your pupils start dilating

48
00:05:06,552 --> 00:05:12,707
and your eyes can become like Mine,

49
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:16,392
very black, absolutely relaxed.

50
00:05:16,392 --> 00:05:19,552
So, you can easily see in a person

51
00:05:19,552 --> 00:05:24,867
how far is the Kundalini. If it has pierced the Agnya,

52
00:05:24,982 --> 00:05:29,152
then the eyes will be completely dilated and will be shining

53
00:05:29,679 --> 00:05:33,232
and then she enters into the Sahasrara.

54
00:05:34,674 --> 00:05:40,648
Now, it is absolutely pure light of knowledge,

55
00:05:41,574 --> 00:05:45,472
love, compassion and attention.

56
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:56,076
All these three things are in that energy.

57
00:05:56,649 --> 00:06:00,120
We know of many energies — like electrical energy,

58
00:06:00,153 --> 00:06:05,770
we know of light energy, we know of other energies.

59
00:06:06,254 --> 00:06:12,643
But these energies cannot think, they cannot adjust,

60
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:16,266
they cannot work on their own.

61
00:06:18,912 --> 00:06:22,312
They are to be handled by us.

62
00:06:22,337 --> 00:06:27,907
But this energy, itself, is the living energy

63
00:06:27,945 --> 00:06:31,710
and knows how to handle itself.

64
00:06:32,635 --> 00:06:35,400
It thinks.

65
00:06:38,741 --> 00:06:42,992
If you see a seed being sprouted,

66
00:06:43,461 --> 00:06:48,358
you’ll find at the tip of the seed there’s a small little cell

67
00:06:49,055 --> 00:06:53,832
which knows how to go around the soft places

68
00:06:53,872 --> 00:07:00,752
and then how to encircle the stones and then how to find its way to the source.

69
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:08,352
That cell has got, I would say, a little Kundalini in it,

70
00:07:08,352 --> 00:07:10,392
the way it moves.

71
00:07:10,392 --> 00:07:18,872
But within you is … a tremendous force of Kundalini exists.

72
00:07:18,872 --> 00:07:24,792
So, you have a storehouse of compassion,

73
00:07:24,792 --> 00:07:30,392
which can be enlightened by the spirit.

74
00:07:30,392 --> 00:07:37,112
You have a storehouse of love, compassion

75
00:07:37,112 --> 00:07:43,672
and knowledge and ocean of forgiveness.

76
00:07:46,285 --> 00:07:51,552
When people get realization, they do not understand

77
00:07:51,592 --> 00:07:56,752
that they have to now grow. And why they don’t grow?

78
00:07:56,792 --> 00:08:00,992
Because they do not ask for these energies.

79
00:08:01,032 --> 00:08:06,592
A person who is a realized soul, if he says that,

80
00:08:06,632 --> 00:08:10,112
“I have to have more compassion.

81
00:08:10,845 --> 00:08:13,992
My compassion is not all right.

82
00:08:14,998 --> 00:08:19,592
My concern about others is not all right.

83
00:08:19,592 --> 00:08:22,272
My generosity is not all right.

84
00:08:22,312 --> 00:08:29,713
I’m exploiting others. I’m exploiting their love”,

85
00:08:30,195 --> 00:08:36,792
then this energy starts moving,

86
00:08:36,792 --> 00:08:41,872
giving you that greater dimension of love and compassion.

87
00:08:41,872 --> 00:08:47,094
But, if you do not want to be

88
00:08:55,495 --> 00:09:00,558
growing in your awareness, then she … she says,

89
00:09:00,592 --> 00:09:04,232
“All right, he is a half-baked Sahaja Yogi, let it be”,

90
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:09,367
she doesn't supply that energy which is stored within you.

91
00:09:09,392 --> 00:09:15,790
I told you, three into seven, that is twenty-one,

92
00:09:15,815 --> 00:09:18,855
raised to power hundred and eight.

93
00:09:19,337 --> 00:09:23,423
So what a storage you have within yourself.

94
00:09:24,296 --> 00:09:30,632
But because of your mundane style of thinking and asking —

95
00:09:30,632 --> 00:09:38,592
in the beginning, when I started Sahaja Yoga people used to ask for, say, jobs

96
00:09:38,592 --> 00:09:43,863
or for ‘My mother is sick’ or a father is sick

97
00:09:43,924 --> 00:09:48,859
or they would ask for money or something like that.

98
00:09:50,411 --> 00:09:56,310
So these wants are not pure wants.

99
00:09:56,392 --> 00:09:59,552
As we know in economics, they are not pure wants.

100
00:09:59,552 --> 00:10:05,872
They’re impure wants because they are never satiable in general.

101
00:10:05,872 --> 00:10:09,352
So this Kundalini that is your Mother,

102
00:10:09,352 --> 00:10:14,966
she is there to supply you, nourish you, to look after you, to make you grow

103
00:10:18,402 --> 00:10:23,752
by giving you a higher personality —

104
00:10:31,007 --> 00:10:36,472
higher personality, wider personality, deeper personality.

105
00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:44,672
Now, we think if somebody is well read,

106
00:10:44,752 --> 00:10:47,072
then we think he is a higher personality.

107
00:10:49,024 --> 00:10:51,112
Sometimes a person who is rich,

108
00:10:51,112 --> 00:10:53,352
we think he is a higher personality.

109
00:10:53,392 --> 00:10:59,032
Sometimes we think a person who is very hard working

110
00:10:59,072 --> 00:11:00,992
is a higher personality.

111
00:11:00,992 --> 00:11:08,672
Sometimes we think a person who is, I mean,

112
00:11:08,752 --> 00:11:15,792
some sort of a confusion about religion or something,

113
00:11:15,792 --> 00:11:18,872
we think he is a higher personality.

114
00:11:19,982 --> 00:11:25,112
Our ideas about higher personality itself are wrong.

115
00:11:26,968 --> 00:11:30,752
People are higher because they are spiritually evolved.

116
00:11:30,752 --> 00:11:36,752
Otherwise, they are not. They go to dogs. Nobody respects them.

117
00:11:36,792 --> 00:11:40,432
Now we are in Germany and Germany —

118
00:11:40,432 --> 00:11:49,832
‘germ’ itself means actually ‘Kundalini’. Germ means in Sanskrit, as you call it, ‘ankura’.

119
00:11:49,872 --> 00:11:56,112
Ankura is the germ. And Germany is the place

120
00:11:56,152 --> 00:12:02,751
where we can have Kundalini Puja, is something really a great coincidence

121
00:12:02,782 --> 00:12:07,828
or I think it’s just Paramchaitanya’s arrangements.

122
00:12:08,573 --> 00:12:18,284
So, to look at a seed, looks like an ordinary thing, nothing special —

123
00:12:18,406 --> 00:12:24,752
could be very hard nut also — mostly the seeds are in nuts, mostly.

124
00:12:24,792 --> 00:12:32,424
If they are not in nuts, then they might be having some sheath or something, minimum.

125
00:12:32,571 --> 00:12:37,258
But you won’t find a seed just hanging from somewhere on a tree.

126
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,713
It has to have some protection,

127
00:12:40,738 --> 00:12:45,532
some sort of a hardness outside.

128
00:12:46,038 --> 00:12:52,533
Now, that hardness is there,

129
00:12:52,767 --> 00:12:57,904
but the germ has a capacity to break that hardness.

130
00:12:58,167 --> 00:13:03,305
Just imagine a germ, which is such a delicate thing,

131
00:13:03,352 --> 00:13:06,021
which even if you touch it might break.

132
00:13:06,086 --> 00:13:15,129
Can break a germ... can break the covering, the hard shell?

133
00:13:15,154 --> 00:13:19,374
How can it do it? Isn’t it fantastic

134
00:13:20,745 --> 00:13:24,124
that such a hard shell,

135
00:13:24,592 --> 00:13:29,232
which we cannot break it with our teeth even,

136
00:13:29,272 --> 00:13:33,143
can be easily broken by a delicate germ.

137
00:13:34,695 --> 00:13:40,633
So at that time, what happens

138
00:13:42,184 --> 00:13:52,952
is the shell itself doesn’t become lively. It doesn’t get life.

139
00:13:54,065 --> 00:14:03,800
There is no movement of the shell itself, but it moves

140
00:14:04,512 --> 00:14:13,064
and it opens. So that delicate thing, when it grows,

141
00:14:14,016 --> 00:14:16,797
then the shell has to break.

142
00:14:17,832 --> 00:14:23,058
In the same way, this Kundalini, which is a delicate thing —

143
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:28,232
if you see a person who is compassionate. “Oh,” they say,

144
00:14:28,232 --> 00:14:31,792
“Mother, he’s too much a gem, you know.”

145
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:36,512
Everybody has sort of a sympathy,

146
00:14:36,552 --> 00:14:39,061
protectiveness for that person.

147
00:14:39,592 --> 00:14:44,746
“He’s just, Mother, he’s just compassion, and all. It’s too much.”

148
00:14:46,318 --> 00:14:51,941
We always feel such a person to be very — a weakling, a weak personality

149
00:14:52,508 --> 00:14:55,069
and that he should be protected.

150
00:14:55,750 --> 00:15:01,072
“Oh, Mother, he doesn’t know also how to abuse people. How will he beat anyone?

151
00:15:01,072 --> 00:15:05,672
He cannot even kill an ant, ant on the road.

152
00:15:05,752 --> 00:15:08,451
How can he do anything when he’s good for nothing?”

153
00:15:09,594 --> 00:15:13,592
That’s our concept, because we think

154
00:15:13,632 --> 00:15:18,083
we should have somebody really a tyrannical person to handle things.

155
00:15:20,512 --> 00:15:24,948
But just see that in a seed,

156
00:15:26,941 --> 00:15:34,084
it is that delicate germ grows and breaks the shell.

157
00:15:36,674 --> 00:15:38,752
In the same way,

158
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:50,352
when we become really delicate like a germ

159
00:15:50,739 --> 00:16:02,072
and then grow in our delicacy and in our beauty of compassion,

160
00:16:02,072 --> 00:16:07,550
love and knowledge which makes you humble,

161
00:16:08,306 --> 00:16:11,027
then these shells will break.

162
00:16:12,789 --> 00:16:16,190
But it’s the other way round, normally.

163
00:16:16,854 --> 00:16:20,143
In Sahaja Yoga now, we have leaders.

164
00:16:20,434 --> 00:16:23,755
We’ve had leaders and leaders and leaders.

165
00:16:24,562 --> 00:16:28,736
Some of them came like tigers.

166
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:32,192
I didn’t know what to do to them.

167
00:16:33,273 --> 00:16:38,552
Even tiger can be ridden by the Goddess Kundalini,

168
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:46,872
because this love has the power to break any hard nut.

169
00:16:50,707 --> 00:16:53,192
So what we should ask for

170
00:16:53,232 --> 00:17:02,552
is that beautiful, soft, compassionate nature,

171
00:17:02,592 --> 00:17:05,782
and then the Kundalini will supply

172
00:17:06,076 --> 00:17:08,886
because she only has that.

173
00:17:12,886 --> 00:17:15,667
Kundalini doesn’t have anything else.

174
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:23,032
All her power is of love, nothing but love.

175
00:17:24,707 --> 00:17:29,528
So how can she give you something she doesn't have?

176
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:35,106
Supposing you hate someone, what can she do?

177
00:17:35,152 --> 00:17:39,500
She can't do anything because she cannot give you powers to hate.

178
00:17:42,925 --> 00:17:47,087
So what she says, “You hate someone, or you forgive…”

179
00:17:47,141 --> 00:17:49,577
She gives you the power to forgive.

180
00:17:51,126 --> 00:17:55,733
Like a sword has to fight a shield, not a sword.

181
00:17:57,955 --> 00:18:03,029
So the violence, as they say, can only be fought with non-violence.

182
00:18:03,507 --> 00:18:07,438
In the same way, if we have to grow,

183
00:18:07,463 --> 00:18:10,252
the Sahaja Yogis have to grow, first of all

184
00:18:10,277 --> 00:18:14,556
we have to see how softly we talk,

185
00:18:16,479 --> 00:18:19,042
how kindly we talk,

186
00:18:20,546 --> 00:18:23,224
how considerate we are.

187
00:18:28,617 --> 00:18:34,993
Now this is externally, but when you start doing that externally

188
00:18:35,018 --> 00:18:38,498
the energy starts coming internally.

189
00:18:38,592 --> 00:18:41,164
You might say, “Mother, even if you think —”

190
00:18:41,202 --> 00:18:45,118
So that’s our thinking. No, you’re thinking that time.

191
00:18:45,512 --> 00:18:49,952
For that thinking, the energy will come from Kundalini

192
00:18:49,952 --> 00:18:52,587
because you’re asking her help.

193
00:18:56,884 --> 00:18:59,364
Whatever she has, she is willing to give, but

194
00:18:59,389 --> 00:19:02,227
whatever she does not have, how can she give?

195
00:19:02,797 --> 00:19:05,373
Now, supposing you want to get angry,

196
00:19:05,861 --> 00:19:09,864
she hasn’t got the power to show anger,

197
00:19:12,492 --> 00:19:17,152
so how can she give you anger and temper.

198
00:19:19,063 --> 00:19:24,695
I mean, sometimes I try, “Let’s see if I can get into ego.”

199
00:19:27,406 --> 00:19:29,626
How to get, I don’t know

200
00:19:31,573 --> 00:19:36,403
because this Kundalini doesn’t know what is this ego,

201
00:19:36,428 --> 00:19:42,232
how to pamper the ego and how to make you fly in the air. No.

202
00:19:43,439 --> 00:19:48,272
So whatever kind of energy she is, she will give you that.

203
00:19:49,272 --> 00:19:51,672
So please remember,

204
00:19:51,672 --> 00:19:59,512
those who try to bring in assertions

205
00:19:59,552 --> 00:20:03,506
and conditionings and ego

206
00:20:03,531 --> 00:20:11,792
and all that are not going to grow because they are not getting the energy

207
00:20:11,823 --> 00:20:16,682
from the Kundalini, but from outside which is absolutely useless.

208
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:36,392
So the power of Kundalini is absolute purity, auspiciousness,

209
00:20:37,455 --> 00:20:43,580
holiness, chastity, self-respect,

210
00:20:46,558 --> 00:20:48,461
pure love,

211
00:20:49,203 --> 00:20:56,672
detachment, concern, enlightened attention –

212
00:21:01,371 --> 00:21:03,595
to give you joy,

213
00:21:05,216 --> 00:21:09,570
as every mother wants that her child should get the joy.

214
00:21:12,196 --> 00:21:16,562
Whichever way is possible, she’ll try to give joy to her children.

215
00:21:16,587 --> 00:21:21,315
In the same way, this Kundalini has only one power —

216
00:21:22,737 --> 00:21:30,257
how to give joy to her own children – and she does that.

217
00:21:31,444 --> 00:21:36,192
Supposing — I mean, I don’t know about modern mothers, but normally

218
00:21:39,242 --> 00:21:44,072
if I would go and say to my mother,

219
00:21:44,072 --> 00:21:47,232
“Teach me how to be angry,”

220
00:21:47,272 --> 00:21:50,909
she will say, “You go and cut your nose.”

221
00:21:54,037 --> 00:22:00,192
If I tell her that, “Tell me how to tell lies,”

222
00:22:00,947 --> 00:22:04,706
she’ll say, “Go and cut your tongue.”

223
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:09,472
If I say, “Tell me how to see bad things in others,”

224
00:22:09,512 --> 00:22:12,801
she’ll say, “take out your eyes is better.”

225
00:22:15,714 --> 00:22:26,512
All these ideas that we have within ourselves

226
00:22:29,077 --> 00:22:34,432
make a very big problem for Kundalini

227
00:22:34,472 --> 00:22:36,899
to enter into your attention.

228
00:22:38,555 --> 00:22:40,952
Now, people always ask,

229
00:22:40,992 --> 00:22:42,552
“Mother, how are we to grow?

230
00:22:42,552 --> 00:22:44,320
What should we do?”

231
00:22:45,892 --> 00:22:48,531
That’s why I say introspection.

232
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:52,784
There should be introspection.

233
00:22:53,885 --> 00:22:56,744
“What do I want in this life?

234
00:22:57,232 --> 00:23:02,432
I should be able to love many more people

235
00:23:02,472 --> 00:23:05,456
without any lust or greed or expectations.”

236
00:23:08,197 --> 00:23:09,571
All right.

237
00:23:11,099 --> 00:23:20,554
Then the floods of abstract love will flow.

238
00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:33,952
She gives you witness state. She gives you peace.

239
00:23:34,619 --> 00:23:37,752
How many things she has to give you

240
00:23:39,002 --> 00:23:40,744
by which

241
00:23:44,369 --> 00:23:46,860
you become so powerful,

242
00:23:49,078 --> 00:23:51,389
so very powerful.

243
00:23:51,752 --> 00:23:54,208
No one can trouble you.

244
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:28,076
She gives you security.

245
00:24:28,901 --> 00:24:31,772
She gives you peace.

246
00:24:32,788 --> 00:24:35,399
She gives you wisdom.

247
00:24:41,133 --> 00:24:48,032
But if you want to ask for stupidity, she cannot do it.

248
00:24:48,072 --> 00:24:52,032
It is impossible. She hasn’t got it with her.

249
00:24:55,935 --> 00:24:59,485
So every Sahaja Yogi who has to grow,

250
00:24:59,745 --> 00:25:11,180
must know what is in store with your own Kundalini.

251
00:25:12,974 --> 00:25:17,210
So now, if you try to do the other way round,

252
00:25:17,263 --> 00:25:19,392
you jump on the left or the right side.

253
00:25:20,663 --> 00:25:25,386
Jump on the left side, then you start moving on the left side,

254
00:25:27,393 --> 00:25:30,183
then you can become anything.

255
00:25:31,164 --> 00:25:37,362
Whatever we hear about people, the way they murder and rape and this and that

256
00:25:37,602 --> 00:25:42,221
and all these things start coming in very easily

257
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:48,820
because that energy lies beyond the Kundalini.

258
00:25:52,181 --> 00:25:54,768
Because you move on that side —

259
00:25:54,793 --> 00:25:57,358
all right, you want bhoots, have them.

260
00:25:57,383 --> 00:25:59,474
You want diseases, have them.

261
00:25:59,499 --> 00:26:04,432
You want to indulge into filthy things, have the filth.

262
00:26:04,432 --> 00:26:07,456
Whatever you want, you can have it.

263
00:26:07,507 --> 00:26:10,382
Also, that is available.

264
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:13,839
Nobody can stop you.

265
00:26:15,879 --> 00:26:17,472
You want to be sly,

266
00:26:17,512 --> 00:26:22,672
you want to be talking behind the backs, all right go ahead.

267
00:26:22,672 --> 00:26:24,672
This is also very common.

268
00:26:24,697 --> 00:26:27,348
I’ve heard that the Sahaja Yogis, specially ladies,

269
00:26:27,373 --> 00:26:31,592
go on talking behind about others, discussing.

270
00:26:31,632 --> 00:26:34,552
This is how we can never grow.

271
00:26:36,026 --> 00:26:39,512
If you have to talk, only talk good about others.

272
00:26:41,658 --> 00:26:44,432
Otherwise, don’t talk, best is.

273
00:26:48,104 --> 00:26:51,985
These things are not going to help us.

274
00:26:52,311 --> 00:26:57,944
Now we are not here in this world, at this stage,

275
00:26:58,069 --> 00:27:03,595
to build them more churches or temples or mosques. No — had enough of them,

276
00:27:04,549 --> 00:27:07,537
had enough of problems.

277
00:27:07,902 --> 00:27:12,560
So now we want to make for ourselves

278
00:27:12,591 --> 00:27:16,326
abode of love and purity,

279
00:27:16,371 --> 00:27:19,177
but those who are residents are not,

280
00:27:19,425 --> 00:27:22,272
then how can you have love?

281
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:29,952
It will be always jealousies and selfishness and all those things there.

282
00:27:31,671 --> 00:27:34,912
So when we talk of the light of the Kundalini,

283
00:27:36,766 --> 00:27:46,592
we have to understand that this light spreads in your life,

284
00:27:47,306 --> 00:27:52,072
outside your life and expresses itself

285
00:27:52,112 --> 00:27:55,072
in a very, very beautiful manner.

286
00:27:56,668 --> 00:28:01,307
Everyone says that Sahaja Yogis look very different from others.

287
00:28:01,332 --> 00:28:06,472
“There's a glow on their face. There’s a … they look like flowers”,

288
00:28:06,512 --> 00:28:12,262
so many, “Relaxed. They’re very beautiful people”.

289
00:28:12,364 --> 00:28:15,952
For example, in Cabella people were so impressed.

290
00:28:15,952 --> 00:28:20,499
They said “These are young people and they have come here,

291
00:28:20,524 --> 00:28:24,680
they’re not fighting among themselves, there are no hooligans among them”.

292
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:29,175
They’re quite surprised how could you be so sensible, so many of you.

293
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:32,440
So many people if they gather anywhere,

294
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:37,230
they can go amok in no time.

295
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:41,600
I mean, even a smaller group

296
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,459
can become mad.

297
00:28:43,549 --> 00:28:46,349
For no rhyme and reason they go mad.

298
00:28:48,837 --> 00:28:56,512
So this collective behavior of yours was so much seen clearly

299
00:28:57,511 --> 00:29:00,591
by those simple village people.

300
00:29:04,744 --> 00:29:09,330
For that, you have to just desire.

301
00:29:11,753 --> 00:29:13,908
You just have to desire

302
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,840
and this pure desire works out in the right direction,

303
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,640
otherwise whatever you desire you can’t get it.

304
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,320
You want money? All right, have it.

305
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,179
Move to the right side.

306
00:29:25,204 --> 00:29:29,000
Get money this way. Get money that way. Do what you like.

307
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,590
Then you want to kill somebody. All right, get to the right side.

308
00:29:35,894 --> 00:29:40,288
You can get many people who will go and kill anybody they want to.

309
00:29:40,858 --> 00:29:44,210
Then you want some publicity or something.

310
00:29:44,235 --> 00:29:46,573
All right, get to the right side.

311
00:29:50,263 --> 00:29:55,656
All these things can happen,

312
00:29:55,793 --> 00:29:57,800
whatever you want

313
00:29:57,868 --> 00:30:02,339
according to the movement that you have.

314
00:30:04,628 --> 00:30:06,951
But for ascent,

315
00:30:08,928 --> 00:30:14,867
your desire should be pure desire

316
00:30:16,973 --> 00:30:22,139
to get to that greater personality

317
00:30:28,893 --> 00:30:34,507
of love and beautiful relationships.

318
00:30:37,087 --> 00:30:40,824
Today you’re worshipping your Kundalini.

319
00:30:40,849 --> 00:30:44,028
You are also worshipping the Adi Kundalini.

320
00:30:51,234 --> 00:30:54,582
Now, you have to find out

321
00:30:55,921 --> 00:31:00,467
what are we doing as far as the Adi Kundalini is concerned.

322
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:12,880
When you worship the Adi Kundalini, the reflection in you,

323
00:31:13,617 --> 00:31:16,931
which is your own Kundalini, feels very happy.

324
00:31:18,067 --> 00:31:20,760
Also the Deities feel happy.

325
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:24,440
In that happy mood, you can achieve

326
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:29,240
a very much deeper experience. That’s a fact.

327
00:31:31,079 --> 00:31:35,938
But, to keep it up, you have to meditate,

328
00:31:35,963 --> 00:31:39,530
otherwise all these strands will go back, slip down,

329
00:31:40,383 --> 00:31:43,275
which have come out in the puja.

330
00:31:44,396 --> 00:31:48,840
I know everyone likes to come to puja, they enjoy it.

331
00:31:52,226 --> 00:31:55,782
But you should understand that,

332
00:31:56,930 --> 00:31:59,839
‘what do we get in this puja?’.

333
00:32:01,121 --> 00:32:06,720
You come here – desire for that higher life.

334
00:32:09,488 --> 00:32:15,280
But try to get out of this every day-to-day, nonsensical life.

335
00:32:16,363 --> 00:32:18,240
If you want, you can do it.

336
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,290
It's again a question of your wanting.

337
00:32:21,381 --> 00:32:24,960
So throughout it is ‘want’.

338
00:32:26,342 --> 00:32:28,161
What is your desire?

339
00:32:32,925 --> 00:32:39,638
We have desire like ‘children’.

340
00:32:40,402 --> 00:32:42,983
Some people want to have children.

341
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:47,501
After the children are born, then they say,

342
00:32:47,526 --> 00:32:52,120
“Wow, what these children! God save me!”

343
00:32:55,208 --> 00:32:59,224
Then you want to have money

344
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:04,613
and most of those money people are now in jail.

345
00:33:13,649 --> 00:33:16,473
Then you want to have fame.

346
00:33:18,424 --> 00:33:23,957
The fame of the people never helps them,

347
00:33:24,639 --> 00:33:34,005
only it gives you problems because of jealousies and all kinds of things.

348
00:33:34,715 --> 00:33:37,169
If fame was such a good thing,

349
00:33:37,194 --> 00:33:39,241
why should people be jealous?

350
00:33:47,769 --> 00:33:51,408
So the power of Kundalini,

351
00:33:52,216 --> 00:33:54,431
which is your own mother,

352
00:33:57,236 --> 00:34:03,482
which has to... which has to rise, which has to come up,

353
00:34:03,578 --> 00:34:06,491
which has to manifest itself,

354
00:34:07,407 --> 00:34:11,323
because of your pure desire.

355
00:34:12,842 --> 00:34:17,760
So in your introspection, in your pujas, in your meditation,

356
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:23,943
if you see for yourself why are you meditating –

357
00:34:24,314 --> 00:34:28,760
it is for pure desire of compassion

358
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,974
and love to be awakened within us –

359
00:34:34,091 --> 00:34:36,804
you are already in the meditation,

360
00:34:37,094 --> 00:34:40,703
you're already growing, the growth has started.

361
00:34:40,922 --> 00:34:44,473
And you'll grow so fast that this shell,

362
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:49,323
which is this human conditioning and egos will just break open.

363
00:34:50,667 --> 00:34:54,400
And then this small little thing

364
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:57,612
which is only in the triangular bone —

365
00:34:57,847 --> 00:35:02,797
imagine in a... there’s a very little space in the triangular bone —

366
00:35:03,334 --> 00:35:07,437
that it comes out and manifests

367
00:35:07,615 --> 00:35:10,490
and can save the whole world.

368
00:35:10,882 --> 00:35:12,427
Just see

369
00:35:13,876 --> 00:35:18,558
the magnificence, the expansiveness,

370
00:35:18,808 --> 00:35:22,902
the greatness of this Kundalini which was within you

371
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:26,957
and which came up in its full strength

372
00:35:27,124 --> 00:35:30,725
and has shown tremendous things.

373
00:35:33,364 --> 00:35:36,895
Such people are the really great people

374
00:35:37,026 --> 00:35:43,418
and not the people who are trying to show off

375
00:35:43,443 --> 00:35:48,707
some sort of a brand cloth they wear, try to show off, no.

376
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:53,123
All these silly ideas and stupidities

377
00:35:53,224 --> 00:35:56,153
have to be given up by Sahaja Yogis

378
00:36:04,808 --> 00:36:13,280
so that this Kundalini wears the beautiful flowers,

379
00:36:14,317 --> 00:36:17,873
your words become fragrant,

380
00:36:22,801 --> 00:36:26,756
your glance becomes soothing,

381
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:33,844
your smile becomes satisfying.

382
00:36:35,817 --> 00:36:38,689
Everything, all your being,

383
00:36:38,714 --> 00:36:45,195
is emitting nothing but goodness, righteousness, peace –

384
00:36:45,677 --> 00:36:48,055
above all, joy.

385
00:36:49,356 --> 00:36:54,156
And the joy you feel now — together

386
00:36:55,739 --> 00:36:59,440
when we were yesterday clapping and singing songs

387
00:36:59,465 --> 00:37:04,065
and we were feeling the joy at a very simple, simple music concert

388
00:37:04,891 --> 00:37:09,412
without any drugs, without any shouting, screaming, nothing —

389
00:37:09,453 --> 00:37:11,251
very simple —

390
00:37:11,743 --> 00:37:16,757
the joy we were feeling, it was because our Kundalini was dancing.

391
00:37:17,641 --> 00:37:22,933
She was so happy because what were you asking there?

392
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:31,120
Nothing but the enjoyment of collectivity.

393
00:37:32,786 --> 00:37:38,200
Collectivity doesn't mean that we all should be stuck together with some glue

394
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:43,180
or something or we all become like Gibraltar,

395
00:37:43,610 --> 00:37:46,792
Rock of Gibraltar. No, it doesn’t mean that.

396
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:51,204
It means wherever you are, you are connected.

397
00:37:52,634 --> 00:37:54,540
That is collectivity.

398
00:37:54,782 --> 00:38:02,709
A connected doesn’t mean that you hate that person. No,

399
00:38:03,204 --> 00:38:06,559
you’re connected means you love that person,

400
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,392
you’re concerned about that person.

401
00:38:10,966 --> 00:38:17,223
The connection, the connecting line, is of love and not of hatred.

402
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:23,496
So, when you are connected with another person, or persons,

403
00:38:25,103 --> 00:38:28,149
then you are in collectivity.

404
00:38:28,265 --> 00:38:33,527
But people will live together and everyday break each other’s heads.

405
00:38:35,407 --> 00:38:40,677
Some of them really give me headaches, I tell you, sometimes because

406
00:38:43,592 --> 00:38:49,638
they are nowhere near the real growth of Sahaja Yoga.

407
00:38:51,428 --> 00:38:56,380
So you may be in America, you may be in India,

408
00:38:56,405 --> 00:38:58,331
you may be anywhere.

409
00:38:58,619 --> 00:39:00,552
You are just connected.

410
00:39:01,310 --> 00:39:03,395
And you are concerned.

411
00:39:03,531 --> 00:39:06,346
As soon as there’s a problem somewhere,

412
00:39:06,441 --> 00:39:11,066
into any part, any part of the world,

413
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:18,080
you are connected and you’re effective, you can manage.

414
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:24,160
But if you are not connected and you are just glued together,

415
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:29,916
it’s very inconvenient to live under such circumstances.

416
00:39:30,481 --> 00:39:34,840
I think people don’t even understand the meaning of collectivity

417
00:39:36,029 --> 00:39:38,759
where there’s not the other,

418
00:39:38,784 --> 00:39:42,211
ananya, where there’s not the other,

419
00:39:43,125 --> 00:39:45,464
there’s no other personality.

420
00:39:48,416 --> 00:39:53,886
These personalities are separated from you

421
00:39:53,911 --> 00:39:58,951
because of left and right or could be both.

422
00:40:02,612 --> 00:40:05,666
But you are yourself fully

423
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:09,440
when you’re absolutely detached

424
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:12,760
and your Kundalini is dancing.

425
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:15,971
You're alone and never alone.

426
00:40:22,661 --> 00:40:26,455
This oneness with the whole

427
00:40:28,218 --> 00:40:32,980
gives you all the security that you want,

428
00:40:33,005 --> 00:40:34,948
all the joy you want

429
00:40:37,615 --> 00:40:43,830
and that's why Kundalini Awakening means collectivity.

430
00:40:45,541 --> 00:40:52,541
Unless and until you want pure collectivity in your being,

431
00:40:53,330 --> 00:40:55,623
Kundalini won't rise.

432
00:40:57,477 --> 00:41:01,234
I feel sad sometimes when people tell me,

433
00:41:01,324 --> 00:41:05,114
“This gentleman is like this, this lady’s like this

434
00:41:05,139 --> 00:41:08,109
and she just says things like that

435
00:41:08,247 --> 00:41:14,467
and she tries to put down her orders” or some man like that.

436
00:41:14,718 --> 00:41:18,201
And I really can’t understand what are they doing here.

437
00:41:20,753 --> 00:41:22,928
We don’t want Hitlers.

438
00:41:26,633 --> 00:41:34,001
This attitude of ours, so far has been on a different level,

439
00:41:34,026 --> 00:41:38,240
like acquire more money, acquire more wealth, acquire more houses,

440
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:43,754
acquire more cars, acquire more wives, husbands, whatever it is, children.

441
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:48,640
But the whole thing changes in Sahaja Yoga.

442
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:50,988
You enjoy everything.

443
00:41:51,183 --> 00:41:53,655
All right, this is your hall,

444
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:56,708
doesn’t matter whosoever it … I am enjoying.

445
00:41:56,733 --> 00:41:59,493
It’s better not to pay for it and enjoy

446
00:42:02,113 --> 00:42:04,228
other people’s money!

447
00:42:08,909 --> 00:42:12,532
This carpet is not mine, very good. That’s excellent.

448
00:42:13,142 --> 00:42:15,284
It’s beautiful, I’m enjoying.

449
00:42:16,462 --> 00:42:20,560
Maybe the one who has got this, one must be worried about something.

450
00:42:20,585 --> 00:42:24,072
It might get spoiled or some such thing, but I’m enjoying.

451
00:42:27,857 --> 00:42:31,882
So when this detachment comes, really enjoy everything.

452
00:42:33,336 --> 00:42:36,908
And in that detachment only you enjoy others also

453
00:42:36,948 --> 00:42:40,788
because you are so detached about it, don’t want anything with anyone.

454
00:42:40,788 --> 00:42:43,788
Only person to person you enjoy.

455
00:42:44,886 --> 00:42:49,202
That means you enjoy the spirit of another person

456
00:42:49,276 --> 00:42:53,108
through your spirit, Atmanya Atmanyat.

457
00:42:53,108 --> 00:42:57,684
It is through the spirit only you enjoy another’s spirit.

458
00:43:01,903 --> 00:43:05,028
And then the spirit itself is, as you know,

459
00:43:05,068 --> 00:43:07,512
is the source of knowledge.

460
00:43:08,527 --> 00:43:15,799
The light of the spirit is the light of love, compassion, forgiveness, everything.

461
00:43:21,479 --> 00:43:25,068
All that starts shining in through your faces.

462
00:43:25,068 --> 00:43:27,439
I mean, from faces you can make out a Sahaja Yogi.

463
00:43:27,464 --> 00:43:29,689
There’s no need to put hands and see.

464
00:43:29,714 --> 00:43:34,050
You know this is a Sahaja Yogi, can’t be anything else.

465
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:43,523
So the relationship with the Adi Kundalini

466
00:43:43,548 --> 00:43:48,548
is that it is the reflection of the Adi Kundalini.

467
00:43:50,032 --> 00:43:53,930
Now the reflection — supposing you take an Indian mirror;

468
00:43:54,279 --> 00:44:00,455
you look in the mirror and you find you look like nothing on earth,

469
00:44:01,283 --> 00:44:05,708
it will just cut you into three pieces, maybe, or anything.

470
00:44:07,245 --> 00:44:10,108
But if you take a Belgian mirror, say,

471
00:44:10,711 --> 00:44:15,210
then the reflection is correct, full –

472
00:44:15,668 --> 00:44:18,548
but still not three dimensional.

473
00:44:19,473 --> 00:44:24,267
But this is a four dimensional reflection —

474
00:44:24,292 --> 00:44:29,586
four dimensional, what is called as turya state.

475
00:44:30,666 --> 00:44:37,268
And that four dimensional personality

476
00:44:39,565 --> 00:44:47,468
you have reflected because of your reflector of your desire.

477
00:44:48,844 --> 00:44:54,856
The reflector is the desire and the reflection is complete.

478
00:44:59,745 --> 00:45:04,229
So when you worship the Adi Kundalini,

479
00:45:04,362 --> 00:45:08,214
what you are trying to do is to cleanse your Kundalini

480
00:45:08,239 --> 00:45:10,919
as well as please the Deities.

481
00:45:12,922 --> 00:45:15,951
Because this is an object,

482
00:45:16,541 --> 00:45:20,157
it is object, it is not to be changed –

483
00:45:20,268 --> 00:45:23,516
but the reflection can change.

484
00:45:31,254 --> 00:45:35,308
The movement of Kundalini also depends

485
00:45:35,348 --> 00:45:38,382
on the temperament of the person,

486
00:45:39,806 --> 00:45:44,713
what sort of a desire he has for his Kundalini to rise.

487
00:45:44,993 --> 00:45:47,881
First of all, there are people who doubt.

488
00:45:48,516 --> 00:45:50,936
They don’t even believe there is Kundalini.

489
00:45:50,961 --> 00:45:52,950
All right, even if they believe, they say,

490
00:45:52,975 --> 00:45:56,437
“Oh, the air might be coming out of something else.”

491
00:45:57,391 --> 00:45:59,365
They don’t want to believe.

492
00:46:00,910 --> 00:46:03,229
So it’s dishonesty.

493
00:46:07,604 --> 00:46:11,268
Kundalini cannot give you dishonesty.

494
00:46:11,308 --> 00:46:14,628
It can give you honesty and faith in honesty.

495
00:46:21,234 --> 00:46:26,548
So she gives you faith in goodness, faith in honesty,

496
00:46:26,548 --> 00:46:32,428
not just by sermon or lecture, nothing by reading Bible or anything,

497
00:46:33,373 --> 00:46:37,684
but actually by actualizing the experience.

498
00:46:38,974 --> 00:46:41,384
Now, supposing

499
00:46:47,722 --> 00:46:49,151
you want

500
00:46:53,502 --> 00:46:55,815
to go to the garden, supposing.

501
00:46:56,409 --> 00:46:58,948
Just you want to go to the garden

502
00:46:59,998 --> 00:47:02,508
and suddenly you find in the garden.

503
00:47:03,685 --> 00:47:07,210
Then you will know that your desire is pure. That’s why it has worked out.

504
00:47:07,235 --> 00:47:09,360
“How am I in the garden?

505
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:13,148
Has garden walked to me or I have walked into the garden?”

506
00:47:14,891 --> 00:47:18,108
All such things go on happening within you.

507
00:47:19,531 --> 00:47:24,125
These are miracles, as they call it, miracles of Sahaja Yoga. Is not that.

508
00:47:24,208 --> 00:47:29,148
Is the pure desire works it because it is powerful.

509
00:47:29,711 --> 00:47:31,770
It just works it.

510
00:47:34,358 --> 00:47:37,490
And when it works it, works the whole thing out,

511
00:47:37,552 --> 00:47:40,047
you develop that faith within yourself.

512
00:47:40,716 --> 00:47:45,263
So that faith, if it is within you,

513
00:47:47,748 --> 00:47:51,316
nobody can challenge that faith,

514
00:47:52,222 --> 00:47:55,775
which is not a blind faith but an open-eyes,

515
00:47:55,800 --> 00:48:02,231
experienced faith which is established within you — cannot be challenged.

516
00:48:03,191 --> 00:48:06,019
If you have the faith, it will be done.

517
00:48:09,468 --> 00:48:13,261
That’s why I always say don’t say even off-hand things

518
00:48:13,286 --> 00:48:15,756
because you’re Sahaja Yogis, you are connected.

519
00:48:16,764 --> 00:48:21,655
If you say, “Let that plane be late,” it will be.

520
00:48:22,647 --> 00:48:25,730
There is no need to say such things.

521
00:48:26,041 --> 00:48:28,747
We have had so many experiences like this.

522
00:48:28,772 --> 00:48:32,544
I have been telling Sahaja Yogis not to say something off-hand

523
00:48:32,589 --> 00:48:35,530
because you must know you are connected now.

524
00:48:36,383 --> 00:48:41,752
Your pure desire is now being fulfilled

525
00:48:41,777 --> 00:48:44,869
and you are now connected, now you are divine,

526
00:48:45,472 --> 00:48:48,018
you are realized souls,

527
00:48:48,736 --> 00:48:52,195
you are very different from others. You can’t imagine.

528
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:54,420
I can't talk like this to anyone.

529
00:48:54,445 --> 00:48:58,211
Take any judge, for example, even from France,

530
00:49:01,003 --> 00:49:05,469
I can’t explain anything to them or talk to them.

531
00:49:05,494 --> 00:49:07,494
It’s beyond their mind.

532
00:49:07,519 --> 00:49:12,559
But for you, all this subtle knowledge is just being absorbed

533
00:49:12,861 --> 00:49:15,981
because your Kundalini’s absorbing it.

534
00:49:20,257 --> 00:49:26,308
Now, as it is, you know I always perspire too much. Why?

535
00:49:26,333 --> 00:49:29,213
Because I go on absorbing your heat.

536
00:49:29,238 --> 00:49:31,894
I absorb so much that I perspire.

537
00:49:31,919 --> 00:49:36,543
So much, despite the fact that you people are having a nice cool breeze,

538
00:49:36,988 --> 00:49:38,629
and I am feeling hot.

539
00:49:41,046 --> 00:49:44,398
So this, your Kundalini, also absorbs.

540
00:49:46,116 --> 00:49:51,540
But whatever you absorb is absorbed back by Me.

541
00:49:52,652 --> 00:49:56,697
But that becomes like a barometer.

542
00:49:56,722 --> 00:50:00,071
Immediately you know, “This is this. This is done.

543
00:50:00,149 --> 00:50:04,542
He’s very hot. He’s like this.”

544
00:50:04,797 --> 00:50:10,037
You immediately know, without even thinking, without for asking,

545
00:50:10,062 --> 00:50:13,382
without any desires, you know that this one is like that.

546
00:50:14,215 --> 00:50:17,716
But the same fellow will be quite friendly with others, is all right,

547
00:50:17,759 --> 00:50:21,696
but you just can’t stand it because your Kundalini is a barometer

548
00:50:21,721 --> 00:50:26,121
and she tells you what’s wrong with others, with yourself.

549
00:50:29,546 --> 00:50:32,698
Now, for example, Agnya is a problem, Agnya.

550
00:50:32,745 --> 00:50:36,148
Everybody, “Mother, Agnya is a problem. Agnya is a problem.”

551
00:50:36,988 --> 00:50:39,360
“Yes, I am egoistical.”

552
00:50:39,459 --> 00:50:42,779
No one says that — means that.

553
00:50:44,196 --> 00:50:49,473
So you are the one who can know about yourself that is Self Knowledge

554
00:50:49,498 --> 00:50:51,982
and also you can know about others

555
00:50:52,007 --> 00:50:55,687
because of the Kundalini’s purity, is the reflector.

556
00:50:59,163 --> 00:51:04,668
And the more you become a better reflector, the more Kundalini shows.

557
00:51:08,631 --> 00:51:12,028
So, for us it is important to know

558
00:51:12,028 --> 00:51:15,868
that our Kundalini’s awakened, that is the pure desire,

559
00:51:15,868 --> 00:51:17,628
that’s the pure mother of us.

560
00:51:17,668 --> 00:51:22,428
Each one has got a separate mother, individual mother,

561
00:51:22,468 --> 00:51:30,308
and that this Kundalini, whichever we have our own separate,

562
00:51:30,308 --> 00:51:33,628
different from others in a way that she...

563
00:51:33,668 --> 00:51:39,068
her awareness about us is different.

564
00:51:39,108 --> 00:51:43,788
But, in her function, in her methods,

565
00:51:43,828 --> 00:51:47,366
she’s just the same in everyone.

566
00:51:51,543 --> 00:51:56,828
She, she knows about me, she knows about you, she knows about you,

567
00:51:56,868 --> 00:52:01,639
so she’s different in a way, in the knowledge,

568
00:52:02,148 --> 00:52:07,428
but the way that she works in everyone is just the same.

569
00:52:09,415 --> 00:52:12,228
You wouldn’t find somebody’s Kundalini in the stomach,

570
00:52:12,253 --> 00:52:14,413
somebody’s in the throat.

571
00:52:15,046 --> 00:52:17,228
It’s in the same place

572
00:52:17,228 --> 00:52:21,628
and it moves the same way. It cures the same way.

573
00:52:21,668 --> 00:52:23,348
It works the same way,

574
00:52:23,348 --> 00:52:26,468
except that it has the knowledge.

575
00:52:27,091 --> 00:52:30,425
For example, if you have two Mercedes cars,

576
00:52:31,025 --> 00:52:34,370
they work the same way — exactly the same.

577
00:52:34,448 --> 00:52:40,304
But supposing if I have to go from here to, say, Frankfurt,

578
00:52:40,343 --> 00:52:44,538
then the road is circuitous, so she has to go in a circuitous way.

579
00:52:45,592 --> 00:52:48,834
But another Mercedes, which has to go on a straight route,

580
00:52:48,859 --> 00:52:50,462
it will go on a straight route.

581
00:52:50,487 --> 00:52:52,788
But the working is the same.

582
00:52:53,697 --> 00:52:57,807
Only the knowledge she has about you in particular

583
00:52:57,832 --> 00:53:01,526
she knows you very well out and out. Remember this.

584
00:53:01,590 --> 00:53:03,229
You cannot cheat her.

585
00:53:06,014 --> 00:53:08,315
She knows you very well

586
00:53:09,182 --> 00:53:12,279
and that is the reason why today we are here

587
00:53:12,304 --> 00:53:15,698
to worship our Kundalini, to give her all the credit,

588
00:53:15,753 --> 00:53:21,231
that “Oh, Mother, You have given us these great powers.

589
00:53:22,004 --> 00:53:25,760
You have given us this subtle knowledge within ourself.

590
00:53:26,824 --> 00:53:28,700
You have

591
00:53:33,733 --> 00:53:37,905
given us the love which encompasses the whole world”

592
00:53:39,054 --> 00:53:47,180
And the more and the more you become aware of her connections —

593
00:53:47,274 --> 00:53:50,411
very, very delicate connections —

594
00:53:52,495 --> 00:53:56,123
then you’ll be amazed. In one of my photographs which came out,

595
00:53:56,148 --> 00:54:00,204
you must have seen many, many lines going like that,

596
00:54:01,923 --> 00:54:04,877
but very thin lines,

597
00:54:06,501 --> 00:54:08,152
sharp, thin.

598
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:11,440
This is how we are.

599
00:54:13,272 --> 00:54:16,430
Now we are all realized souls.

600
00:54:17,602 --> 00:54:21,532
Only thing, if we have to develop ourselves and grow,

601
00:54:21,557 --> 00:54:25,721
we have to ask for, desire for,

602
00:54:27,018 --> 00:54:30,026
something very beautiful.

603
00:54:32,166 --> 00:54:34,468
But our attention is moving on nonsensical things.

604
00:54:34,508 --> 00:54:36,630
How will you grow?

605
00:54:40,628 --> 00:54:43,183
That's why I said we have to meditate

606
00:54:43,221 --> 00:54:46,261
so we get into thoughtless awareness

607
00:54:46,294 --> 00:54:52,117
by which we allow the Kundalini to grow.

608
00:54:56,916 --> 00:55:01,157
I hope after today's program

609
00:55:01,182 --> 00:55:04,682
people will pay attention to their own Kundalini

610
00:55:04,707 --> 00:55:07,775
and not to the defects of other people.

611
00:55:07,905 --> 00:55:10,108
First you must grow

612
00:55:10,276 --> 00:55:15,356
and develop a personality of that compassion and love and everything.

613
00:55:17,205 --> 00:55:21,988
Then only you’ll be amazed.

614
00:55:23,197 --> 00:55:26,295
You’ll grow into something really,

615
00:55:27,252 --> 00:55:33,332
a beautiful picture of perfection as a human being.

616
00:55:36,613 --> 00:55:39,324
So may God bless you.
