WEBVTT

00:01.342 --> 01:20.180
Marathi

01:20.205 --> 01:23.141
On behalf of all of you

01:23.166 --> 01:28.334
Sahaja Yogi organisers of Bombay who have made these arrangements

01:28.359 --> 01:31.737
I thank them all.

01:31.762 --> 01:40.877
And on my own behalf also, I thank them a lot. A very beautiful place.

01:40.902 --> 01:47.609
They have chosen a beautiful place for us.

01:47.634 --> 01:50.789
This is also God's grace

01:50.814 --> 01:53.228
that the thing about which I was going to speak

01:53.253 --> 01:57.912
sitting under the same trees, the talk about Sahastrara is taking place.

01:57.937 --> 02:00.893
Fourteen years ago, we should say

02:00.918 --> 02:04.110
or thirteen years have already passed

02:04.135 --> 02:06.954
and now the fourteenth year has started.

02:06.978 --> 02:14.833
This great work was accomplished in the world, when Sahastrara was opened.

02:14.858 --> 02:19.852
I have told you about this many times, on every Sahasrara day

02:19.877 --> 02:30.535
that what had happened? How it was done and what is its importance?

02:30.560 --> 02:34.791
But the fourteenth birthday is very important.

02:34.816 --> 02:37.984
Because man lives at fourteen levels

02:38.009 --> 02:44.545
and the day he crosses over the fourteenth level, he becomes a complete Sahaja Yogi.

02:44.570 --> 02:50.241
So, today Sahaja Yoga has also become Sahaja Yogi.

02:50.266 --> 02:55.740
Like this, God has created fourteen levels within you.

02:55.765 --> 02:59.548
If you count these in an ordinary way

02:59.573 --> 03:05.882
then you know that, there are seven Chakras within us.

03:05.907 --> 03:09.423
Apart from these, the two more Chakras that are there

03:09.448 --> 03:14.213
about which, you do not talk much

03:14.238 --> 03:18.705
is the chakra of Chandra and that of Surya.

03:18.730 --> 03:20.956
Then there is 'Hamsa Chara'.

03:20.981 --> 03:24.064
Then there are three more chakras.

03:24.089 --> 03:27.822
Seven and three make ten.

03:27.847 --> 03:32.402
Then above that there are four chakras.

03:32.427 --> 03:34.995
Then there are four chakras above Sahastrara.

03:35.020 --> 03:38.510
And I have told you about these chakras also.

03:38.535 --> 03:47.676
Ardhabindu, Bindu, Valaya and Pradakhshina.

03:47.701 --> 03:51.088
These are four chakras.

03:51.113 --> 03:54.945
Even after Sahajyoga, when your Sahastrara has opened

03:54.970 --> 03:59.671
you have to pass through these four chakras.

03:59.696 --> 04:06.588
Ardhabindu, Bindu, Valaya and Pradakhshina.

04:06.612 --> 04:14.060
After these four chakras, we can say that we have become Sahaj yogi.

04:14.085 --> 04:16.956
But you see from the other angle also.

04:16.981 --> 04:22.499
We have to cross fourteen stages to reach up to Sahastrara

04:22.524 --> 04:24.339
if we divide these.

04:24.364 --> 04:29.478
Seven chakras are situated on Ida Nadi and seven on Pingala Nadi.

04:29.503 --> 04:33.850
When man ascends, he does not do so in a straight direction.

04:33.875 --> 04:39.233
He comes first to the left, then to the right

04:39.258 --> 04:41.270
then again to the left, and then to the right.

04:41.295 --> 04:50.199
And when Kundalini ascends, She also does so, dividing Herself into these two.

04:50.224 --> 04:54.862
The reason for it is: If I make you to understand

04:54.887 --> 04:58.367
that there are two ropes.

04:58.392 --> 05:07.528
These two ropes, during the process of coming down or going up, cross over twice.

05:07.552 --> 05:09.949
When it crosses twice

05:09.974 --> 05:16.361
then its left and right this way, first left and then right

05:16.387 --> 05:17.903
because of the crossing over of both

05:17.928 --> 05:21.168
the right one goes to the right and left one to the right.

05:21.193 --> 05:26.806
Now if we see this, I can show you, suppose it came this way

05:26.831 --> 05:28.347
Now it has taken one round

05:28.372 --> 05:30.869
and to take second round has come again by the same route

05:30.894 --> 05:34.457
It came this way and has taken one round and the another round.

05:34.482 --> 05:37.551
In this way it crosses twice.

05:37.576 --> 05:45.072
When Kundalini ascends, you see on the chakra whether the left is caught or the right is caught.

05:45.097 --> 05:49.682
Because Kundalini is only one, but on every chakra you see both the things.

05:49.707 --> 05:51.210
See in this way

05:51.235 --> 05:53.651
whether left is caught up or the right.

05:53.676 --> 05:58.755
Thus within us, if each chakra is divided into two, left and right

05:58.780 --> 06:00.358
then seven into two, is equal to fourteen.

06:00.383 --> 06:11.278
So, within us fourteen stages have to be crossed before reaching Sahastrara.

06:11.303 --> 06:17.346
And if you understand this, that these seven, and seven above.

06:17.371 --> 06:20.229
Then in this way also, a path of fourteen is created.

06:20.254 --> 06:27.401
So this number fourteen in Kundalini shastra  is very important,very important!

06:27.426 --> 06:29.997
Very important!

06:30.022 --> 06:33.804
And until we understand fully

06:33.829 --> 06:36.653
that when we will ascend above these fourteen stages

06:36.678 --> 06:39.767
then only,we become entitled to the blessings of Sahaja Yoga.

06:39.792 --> 06:45.919
We should march forward unceasingly and get completely involved into it.

06:45.944 --> 06:51.623
'Rajna, virajna' – these words I have said many a times earlier also.

06:51.648 --> 06:57.692
But today specially, we should understand that on the Sahastrara day

06:57.717 --> 07:02.329
what is Rajna (to be the master) and what is Virajna (to assume)?

07:02.354 --> 07:11.120
Now, you are sitting here, look at these trees.

07:11.145 --> 07:17.114
This is the tree of Shriphala.

07:17.139 --> 07:23.740
Nariyal is called shriphala. Coconut is called Shriphala.

07:23.765 --> 07:28.102
Shriphala which is a coconut

07:28.127 --> 07:30.548
whether you have ever thought about it or not, I don’t know

07:30.573 --> 07:32.301
but it is a thing to be really thought about.

07:32.326 --> 07:35.060
‘Why it is called Shriphala?’

07:35.085 --> 07:39.549
This grows along the sea coast and nowhere else.

07:39.574 --> 07:42.894
The best fruit grows on the sea coast.

07:42.919 --> 07:46.260
The reason is that the sea is the dharma.

07:46.285 --> 07:49.646
Wherever there is dharma, only there, the Shriphala blossoms.

07:49.671 --> 07:53.200
Where there is no dharma, Shriphala won't be there

07:53.225 --> 07:59.466
but everything resides in the sea.

07:59.491 --> 08:06.639
Every type of cleanliness, dirt, everything is inside it.

08:06.664 --> 08:14.207
This sea water is also full of salt, it has salt in it.

08:14.232 --> 08:17.799
Christ had said “You, are the salt of the earth”

08:17.824 --> 08:20.287
which means that you can enter into everything.

08:20.312 --> 08:23.987
You can impart taste to everything.

08:24.012 --> 08:27.603
You are the salt, without salt man cannot live.

08:27.628 --> 08:30.026
The Pranashakti (Life force) that we take in.

08:30.051 --> 08:33.781
If we don’t have salt inside our body, Pranashakti cannot work.

08:33.806 --> 08:36.720
Salt is the catalyst.

08:36.745 --> 08:40.063
And this salt fully organises for us to live

08:40.088 --> 08:43.505
to live in this world, to live in the universe.

08:43.530 --> 08:50.533
If a man doesn't have salt within him, he would be of no use.

08:50.558 --> 08:56.952
But when this tree rises towards God

08:56.977 --> 08:59.313
then it leaves all the salt below on the ground itself.

08:59.338 --> 09:03.743
Everything is left behind.

09:03.768 --> 09:09.274
And when the sunlight falls on these trees

09:09.299 --> 09:12.396
and with the sunlight falling on it

09:12.421 --> 09:22.310
and when the sap of its leaves and the sap of the whole tree is sucked upwards

09:22.335 --> 09:24.407
because evaporation takes place

09:24.432 --> 09:31.423
then this water flows upwards through the trunk.

09:31.448 --> 09:33.715
Leaving everything apart

09:33.740 --> 09:40.166
crossing those fourteen things, reaches the top and Shriphala is formed.

09:40.191 --> 09:45.294
You are that Shriphala. And it is essential to offer Shriphala to the Devi.

09:45.319 --> 09:49.474
Without the offering of shriphala, the puja is not considered Sampurna (accomplished).

09:49.499 --> 09:51.745
Shriphala also is made up in a strange way.

09:51.770 --> 09:57.114
There is no fruit in the world like Shriphala.

09:57.139 --> 10:01.433
No part of it gets wasted.

10:01.458 --> 10:03.338
Each and every part of it is used.

10:03.363 --> 10:05.804
Right from its leaves, everything is used.

10:05.828 --> 10:12.493
And of Shriphala itself, each and every part is used.

10:12.518 --> 10:17.911
You see, Shriphala is also like a human being’s Sahastrara.

10:17.936 --> 10:25.411
Like the hair we have, the same way Shriphala also has hair.

10:25.436 --> 10:31.886
This Shriphala, has hair outside it for its protection.

10:31.911 --> 10:37.746
The protection from death is provided to us by the hair.

10:37.771 --> 10:41.428
So the hair should be given great respect.

10:41.453 --> 10:51.553
The hair is so great and very powerful thing because it protects you.

10:51.578 --> 10:54.361
You are protected by it.

10:54.386 --> 11:00.388
And inside this, like we have cranial bones, which are bones

11:00.413 --> 11:04.413
That too you see, inside the Shriphala is a lot like this.

11:04.438 --> 11:10.650
There is a hard kind of a covering on the outside.

11:10.675 --> 11:14.155
After that, inside us is grey matter and white matter.

11:14.180 --> 11:20.002
These two things are inside us, grey matter and white matter.

11:20.027 --> 11:31.646
And inside that is water, which is like the cerebro spinal fluid inside us.

11:31.672 --> 11:37.967
So this sakshat shriphala, itself is our..........

11:37.992 --> 11:41.533
If, for these (trees) this is the fruit

11:41.558 --> 11:44.299
for us, this [brain] is the fruit.

11:44.324 --> 11:50.610
Our brain is the fruit of the whole of our evolution.

11:50.635 --> 11:53.158
Whatever has been our evolution to date

11:53.183 --> 11:54.791
that from amoeba, today we have become humans

11:54.816 --> 12:02.306
We have got all that as a result of this brain.

12:02.331 --> 12:07.925
Whatever we have got, is through this brain.

12:07.950 --> 12:09.872
All kinds of powers within this

12:09.897 --> 12:19.943
all the type of wealth we have received, is accumulated in this.

12:19.968 --> 12:27.840
Now inside this heart, the Spirit that resides and its light within us

12:27.865 --> 12:35.141
after Sahajyoga, spreads in seven layers from both the sides.

12:35.166 --> 12:41.098
That can happen only when one’s Sahastrara (is open).

12:41.123 --> 12:48.303
Till now, we had been doing the same job with our brain.

12:48.328 --> 12:50.880
Before realization

12:50.905 --> 12:55.132
except this that we do with the help of Ego and Superego.

12:55.157 --> 12:58.380
With the help of both these, we do whatever has to be done.

12:58.405 --> 13:05.196
Ego and Super-Ego or you can say Manas and Ego.

13:05.221 --> 13:08.967
With the help of these two, we do all our work.

13:08.992 --> 13:15.378
But after reaIization, we work with the help of our Spirit.

13:15.403 --> 13:24.373
Spirit, before realization resides within the heart.

13:24.398 --> 13:34.652
Absolutely separate as a kshetr Agnya (witness), you simply watch.

13:34.677 --> 13:39.274
Its job, whatsoever it may be, just to witness, it keeps doing.

13:39.299 --> 13:43.705
But its light is not in our attention (chitta).

13:43.730 --> 13:48.352
It is separate from us. It is not in our attention.

13:48.377 --> 13:52.145
After realization, it comes into our attention first.

13:52.170 --> 13:56.895
First, it comes into our attention.

13:56.920 --> 14:04.825
And attention, as you know, is in the Void.

14:04.850 --> 14:08.749
After that, its light comes into the Truth

14:08.774 --> 14:14.810
because with the entering of light into our brain, we know the truth.

14:14.835 --> 14:17.044
We Know doesn’t mean that we know through the intellect.

14:17.069 --> 14:23.364
But know in reality, that this is the Truth.

14:23.389 --> 14:26.512
After that its light is seen in the heart.

14:26.537 --> 14:29.503
The heart becomes profound.

14:29.528 --> 14:32.781
The heart starts expanding, it is in the state of joy.

14:32.806 --> 14:35.547
That’s why it’s called Sat-chit-anand.

14:35.572 --> 14:40.370
Sat, Chitta and Anand (Truth, attention and bliss).

14:40.395 --> 14:47.764
Truth within our brain, attention within our dharma and joy within our Spirit.

14:47.789 --> 14:52.397
These start getting enlightened.

14:52.422 --> 14:57.946
Its light spreads gradually at first, this you all know.

14:57.971 --> 14:59.818
Its light grows slowly and slowly.

14:59.843 --> 15:07.052
It’s a subtle thing. It’s very subtle at first because of the gross setup we live in.

15:07.076 --> 15:09.938
In that setup, it becomes difficult to catch hold of that subtle.

15:09.963 --> 15:14.431
But gradually that hold also develops.

15:14.456 --> 15:19.670
After that you start to grow, to progress.

15:19.695 --> 15:25.264
With the opening of a single petal of Sahastrara, the Kundalini comes up.

15:25.289 --> 15:29.120
But its light does not start spreading all around just then.

15:29.145 --> 15:36.424
The Kundalini has just come up and you have saluted the seat of Sadashiva.

15:36.449 --> 15:40.574
Within you, the light of the Spirit has started flowing hazily

15:40.599 --> 15:46.068
but it has not yet fully blossomed in this brain.

15:46.093 --> 15:47.942
Now the surprising thing is that

15:47.967 --> 15:55.181
if you want to spread it through your brain you cannot.

15:55.283 --> 16:06.371
Now a perfect balance of our brain and our heart will have to be shown.

16:06.396 --> 16:13.211
You know well, that when you work too much with your intellect, heart failure occurs.

16:13.236 --> 16:16.945
And when you work too much with your heart, the brain fails.

16:16.970 --> 16:20.576
There exists a relationship between them, it exists beforehand.

16:20.601 --> 16:28.241
A very deep relationship.

16:28.266 --> 16:34.126
And because of this deep relationship, when you get your realization

16:34.151 --> 16:37.231
their relationship has to become all the more deeper.

16:37.256 --> 16:43.345
The relationship between the heart and this brain should be very deep.

16:43.370 --> 16:46.875
The moment it gets completely integrated

16:46.900 --> 16:53.285
your attention becomes completely Parameshwar Swaroop (one with the Divine).

16:53.310 --> 16:55.812
The same thing is also said in Hatha Yoga

16:55.837 --> 16:59.908
that Mana (superego) and Ahamkara (ego) both get dissolved.

16:59.933 --> 17:03.481
But just by telling like this, nobody will understand

17:03.506 --> 17:05.502
how will ego and super-ego dissolve?

17:05.527 --> 17:08.530
People get after super-ego and ego.

17:08.555 --> 17:10.347
If you beat down  ego,  super-ego comes up

17:10.372 --> 17:12.285
and if you beat down  super-ego,  ego comes up.

17:12.310 --> 17:13.832
They just cannot understand, what is this madness?

17:13.857 --> 17:15.236
How will this go?

17:15.261 --> 17:18.961
How to win over  super-ego and ego?

17:18.986 --> 17:23.867
There’s only one door for that and that is Agnya chakra.

17:23.969 --> 17:29.109
By working on Agnya chakra these two, ego and super-ego, get completely dissolved.

17:29.134 --> 17:30.940
And as soon as they get dissolved

17:30.965 --> 17:37.210
heart and this brain, establish a complete concord.

17:37.235 --> 17:39.992
But there is no oneness.

17:40.017 --> 17:44.780
It is this 'oneness' that we have to achieve.

17:44.805 --> 17:47.554
So your heart itself, becomes Sahastrara

17:47.579 --> 17:51.942
and your Sahastrara itself, becomes heart.

17:51.967 --> 17:55.514
What ever you think is in your heart

17:55.539 --> 17:59.920
and whatever is in your heart that is what you think.

17:59.945 --> 18:01.855
When you  are in such a state

18:01.880 --> 18:12.322
then any kind of doubt, any kind of disbelief, any kind of fear

18:12.353 --> 18:16.519
no such thing exists.

18:16.544 --> 18:20.334
Like, when a person gets a fear, what is done to him?

18:20.359 --> 18:23.822
He is taught through the brain: “Look here, there’s nothing to fear.

18:23.847 --> 18:27.767
Look, you were afraid for a useless thing. Now take a light and see.”

18:27.792 --> 18:31.428
Then, although he understands through his brain, still he fears.

18:31.453 --> 18:36.399
But when both the things become one

18:36.424 --> 18:38.384
you try to understand this point

18:38.409 --> 18:42.262
that, the brain with the help of which you think

18:42.287 --> 18:52.339
which makes your Mana, understands and takes care of it.

18:52.364 --> 18:54.518
If that brain itself becomes your Mana

18:54.543 --> 18:57.356
this means, just understand, that there’s such an instrument

18:57.381 --> 19:03.344
which has an automatic accelerator and brake

19:03.369 --> 19:05.704
and both are one.

19:05.729 --> 19:07.536
Whenever it wants, it becomes the brake

19:07.561 --> 19:09.750
and whenever it wants, it becomes the accelerator

19:09.775 --> 19:11.500
and it knows everything.

19:11.525 --> 19:18.802
When such a state comes you become the complete Master.

19:18.827 --> 19:22.142
Such a state we should definitely achieve.

19:22.167 --> 19:24.545
Till now, you people have progressed a lot.

19:24.570 --> 19:29.068
You have reached quite a high level.

19:29.093 --> 19:33.669
Definitely, now it should be said of you that, now you have become Shriphala.

19:33.694 --> 19:38.660
But I always talk of what is ahead

19:38.685 --> 19:41.352
because, if this [coconut] tree is to be climbed then

19:41.377 --> 19:45.100
have you seen how people climb it?

19:45.125 --> 19:47.947
If you ask a man to climb and watch him, you will understand

19:47.972 --> 19:50.678
you will see that he wraps a rope around himself

19:50.703 --> 19:53.332
and keeps hooking that rope higher on the tree.

19:53.357 --> 19:57.005
When that rope is hooked higher up, then he climbs up with the help of that rope.

19:57.030 --> 20:02.633
In the same way,  our own rope has always to be kept hooked higher.

20:02.658 --> 20:07.290
And only when you learn this, can your climbing be very quick.

20:07.315 --> 20:11.630
But mostly we keep hooking the rope lower.

20:11.655 --> 20:14.945
Even after coming to SahajaYoga, we hook the rope lower

20:14.970 --> 20:17.575
and say that, “Mother, we have made no progress at all.”

20:17.600 --> 20:18.821
Now, how can there be any progress

20:18.846 --> 20:20.155
when you hook the rope in the opposite direction

20:20.180 --> 20:21.982
making arrangement to come down?

20:22.007 --> 20:25.216
While coming down, you do not even need to hook the rope.

20:25.241 --> 20:27.407
You just loosen it a bit and you will come down!

20:27.432 --> 20:30.187
That arrangement is made beforehand for coming down.

20:30.212 --> 20:33.302
It is only for climbing up that the arrangement has to be made.

20:33.327 --> 20:36.536
So, to become something, hard work has to be put in.

20:36.561 --> 20:42.114
And to lose whatever has been achieved, no hard work is required.

20:42.139 --> 20:45.752
There’s no question about it.

20:45.777 --> 20:49.059
If you understand this point

20:49.084 --> 20:52.868
then you will realise that you must always look upward.

20:52.893 --> 20:56.537
If you are standing at any step of a ladder but your gaze is fixed higher

20:56.562 --> 21:01.785
then he is much higher than another person, who is looking downward.

21:01.810 --> 21:05.096
That is why, sometimes even very old Sahaja Yogis come down.

21:05.121 --> 21:08.188
People say that, “Mother, he was such an old Sahaja Yogi

21:08.213 --> 21:10.331
was for so many years with you, did this, did that.”

21:10.356 --> 21:13.165
But he was always looking down.

21:13.190 --> 21:16.521
What can I do, if his gaze is downward and has come down?

21:16.546 --> 21:18.343
You should always look upward.

21:18.368 --> 21:21.717
Now even to see this fruit you have to look upward.

21:21.742 --> 21:23.358
Even their gaze is upwards.

21:23.383 --> 21:25.485
The gaze of all these trees is upward.

21:25.510 --> 21:27.369
Because they know that without keeping their gaze upwards

21:27.394 --> 21:30.588
neither they can get Laxmi, nor get this work done

21:30.613 --> 21:36.671
nor can they make Shriphala.

21:36.696 --> 21:39.690
Trees should be very well observed and understood.

21:39.715 --> 21:41.944
You can learn Sahaja Yoga very well, from a tree.

21:41.969 --> 21:44.282
These are very great Gurus for you.

21:44.307 --> 21:48.486
Like, when we look towards a tree

21:48.511 --> 21:52.103
we should first observe how it settles its roots.

21:52.128 --> 21:54.698
First, it takes care of its roots.

21:54.723 --> 21:59.689
And to take care of and fix its roots what it does?

21:59.714 --> 22:01.498
It keeps penetrating and going deep into the roots.

22:01.523 --> 22:05.577
This is our dharma, this is our attention.

22:05.602 --> 22:08.414
Within this, it keeps going deep.

22:08.439 --> 22:19.784
And with that attention, it sucks that  All-Pervading Power.

22:19.809 --> 22:23.397
This is an upside down tree.

22:23.422 --> 22:27.244
To that All-pervading Power, these roots start sucking.

22:27.269 --> 22:32.174
And, after sucking this, after all what has it to do?

22:32.199 --> 22:38.754
Then its sight goes higher, and this way it makes that Shriphala.

22:38.779 --> 22:46.527
Your Sahastrara is also like this very Shriphala. It’s extremely dear to Mother.

22:46.552 --> 22:49.748
And there should be this type of surrendering of self.

22:49.773 --> 22:51.227
Many people told me yesterday

22:51.252 --> 22:54.444
“Mother, we feel cool vibrations in hands, also in feet

22:54.469 --> 22:55.298
but not here (Sahastrara).”

22:55.323 --> 22:57.364
Who presides there?

22:57.389 --> 23:02.308
Just know this and coolness will come from here.

23:02.333 --> 23:09.597
And the One, who is sitting there, is the fruit of all things.

23:09.621 --> 23:20.870
The roots of this tree, fixed in the soil below, are also born out of it.

23:20.895 --> 23:24.675
Its trunk, its hard work, its evolution

23:24.700 --> 23:28.653
all this in the end becomes that fruit.

23:28.678 --> 23:30.997
Everything is inherent in that fruit.

23:31.022 --> 23:36.704
You put that fruit in the soil and again the whole thing will be born out.

23:36.728 --> 23:41.670
It is the meaning of everything. It is the ultimate end of everything.

23:41.695 --> 23:47.555
In the whole world, whatever work of God has taken place till today

23:47.580 --> 23:49.718
Whatever work He has done

23:49.743 --> 23:57.026
its whole complete form, the result of its fruit, is our Mahayoga of today!

23:57.051 --> 24:01.408
And who is its Swamini, you know!

24:01.433 --> 24:04.095
So, at such an auspicious time, you have taken your birth

24:04.120 --> 24:07.269
and at such an auspicious occasion got your realization.

24:07.294 --> 24:09.486
So you should feel blessed

24:09.511 --> 24:14.441
and, becoming like this shriphala, you should be surrendered.

24:14.466 --> 24:18.882
The fruit is only removed from the tree when it matures, otherwise it is useless.

24:18.907 --> 24:21.864
Before it is mature, it cannot be offered to Mother.

24:21.889 --> 24:26.161
Therefore develop maturity. Give up childishness.

24:26.186 --> 24:29.663
Till childishness remains, you will keep sticking to the tree.

24:29.688 --> 24:35.900
But for offering, what is the use of the fruit which is sticking to the tree?

24:35.925 --> 24:38.922
Only when it is removed from the tree and then offered

24:38.947 --> 24:42.149
is the puja considered having been accomplished.

24:42.174 --> 24:48.959
So, to help you to understand Sahaja Yoga, in a very great symbolic form

24:48.984 --> 24:51.286
Sakshat Shriphala itself is standing before you.

24:51.311 --> 24:55.960
It is indeed a great blessing, that today all of us have gathered here

24:55.985 --> 25:00.338
and in this great celebration, all these trees have also given us company.

25:00.363 --> 25:04.538
They are also (Nadita) resounding, they are also (Spandita) vibrating

25:04.563 --> 25:07.871
and they are also listening and dancing to the same rhythm.

25:07.896 --> 25:10.366
They also understand the significance of it.

25:10.391 --> 25:15.479
In the same way, you also have Shriphala in you.

25:15.504 --> 25:17.971
Fully mature it.

25:17.996 --> 25:23.130
There is only one way to mature it, that you must have concord with your heart.

25:23.155 --> 25:25.536
It is impotant that there should be oneness with the heart.

25:25.561 --> 25:29.589
There is no difference between heart and the brain.

25:29.614 --> 25:34.041
From the heart, we desire and from the brain, it is fulfilled.

25:34.066 --> 25:38.984
When both the things become one, only then, will you be fully benefitted.

25:39.009 --> 25:44.859
Now for common people, Sahaja Yoga is a very secret thing.

25:44.884 --> 25:49.490
They do not understand, because their daily life is of that level only.

25:49.545 --> 25:51.105
On that level they move.

25:51.130 --> 25:52.497
But your level is different.

25:52.522 --> 25:58.263
When you look towards others, mostly it is with compassion.

25:58.288 --> 26:01.401
Because, what are these poor people? What is going to happen to them?

26:01.426 --> 26:05.052
Where will they go? They don’t understand. What is their state?

26:05.077 --> 26:08.546
On what road are they going to reach?

26:08.571 --> 26:12.605
After understanding this, you people should try to understand that

26:12.630 --> 26:17.227
if by explaining them, they can understand Sahaja Yoga it’s very good.

26:17.252 --> 26:18.856
They should be explained and told.

26:18.881 --> 26:20.835
But if they do not bother

26:20.860 --> 26:23.308
then there’s no use of breaking our heads before them.

26:23.333 --> 26:25.808
There is no use of breaking one’s Shriphala.

26:25.833 --> 26:29.439
Keep it safely protected. Its job is much higher.

26:29.464 --> 26:34.105
You have got it for a much higher purpose and keep it at that higher level.

26:34.130 --> 26:37.968
And only on attaining that accomplished, wonderful state

26:37.993 --> 26:40.258
can you consider yourself blessed.

26:40.283 --> 26:43.277
Therefore, there’s no need to break our heads for meaningless things.

26:43.302 --> 26:45.103
There’s no need to argue with anyone.

26:45.128 --> 26:48.529
But your own state must be maintained and you must not come down.

26:48.554 --> 26:49.858
Until this happens

26:49.883 --> 26:58.449
the full surrender of Sahajyoga within you, will not be achieved .

26:58.474 --> 27:01.091
Whatever was to be imbibed, has not been achieved.

27:01.116 --> 27:03.075
Whatever growth was to take place,  has not been achieved.

27:03.100 --> 27:08.466
Whatever was to be your mastery and full growth, that hasn’t been achieved

27:08.491 --> 27:10.283
You are mistaken.

27:10.308 --> 27:13.361
Therefore on no false premise should you think that.

27:13.386 --> 27:16.902
Don't think that we have become some great Sahaja Yogis, or anything.

27:16.927 --> 27:22.623
When you become very great, then you bow down.

27:22.648 --> 27:26.221
Look at these trees. The breeze is blowing in the opposite direction.

27:26.246 --> 27:28.909
Actually, the trees should be bent towards this side

27:28.934 --> 27:30.165
while the wind is flowing in this direction.

27:30.190 --> 27:33.672
But which side will the tree bend?

27:33.697 --> 27:37.101
Have you ever noticed that all the trees are facing in that direction?

27:37.126 --> 27:40.840
Why? The breeze coming from that side is not pushing these.

27:40.865 --> 27:42.623
Even then, why are the trees bending towards the same side only?

27:42.648 --> 27:48.278
And without this breeze, we don’t know how much further they might have bent !

27:48.303 --> 27:53.061
Because they know that He (sea) is the giver to all.

27:53.086 --> 27:56.304
Being reverent and extremely humble, they are bowing down.

27:56.329 --> 27:59.380
And the one who is the giver, is the dharma.

27:59.405 --> 28:01.414
The dharma which is inside us

28:01.439 --> 28:06.403
when this gets fully awakened, is fully manifesting

28:06.428 --> 28:12.247
only then the Shriphala inside us will be so sweet, beautiful and nourishing.

28:12.272 --> 28:15.557
And then the world will get to know from your life itself what you are

28:15.582 --> 28:17.296
and not from anything else.

28:17.321 --> 28:25.220
You say that fourteen times you have celebrated the birthday of this Sahastrara

28:25.245 --> 28:28.940
and don't know, how many more years will you celebrate?

28:28.965 --> 28:33.232
But whenever you celebrated the birthday of this Sahastrara

28:33.257 --> 28:38.252
along with that, your Sahastrara also has been opening and growing.

28:38.277 --> 28:41.145
To accept any kind of compromise

28:41.170 --> 28:47.387
to loosen hold of your Self in any matter, does not behove a Sahaja Yogi.

28:47.412 --> 28:55.019
A person who is a Sahaja Yogi should bravely lay his path and move forward.

28:55.056 --> 28:58.955
Any number of obstacles, the relatives, the family, this, that

28:58.980 --> 29:01.966
have no meaning. These have been with you before.

29:01.991 --> 29:03.575
In this life, you have to achieve something

29:03.600 --> 29:05.609
and by your achieving it, if others also get it

29:05.634 --> 29:06.762
then they are blessed, it is their good fortune.

29:06.787 --> 29:10.303
If they don’t get it, will you pull them up by your hands?

29:10.328 --> 29:11.952
It is like this, that if you go to the sea

29:11.977 --> 29:14.236
and have huge stones attached to your feet

29:14.261 --> 29:17.080
and you request the sea, “Please swim me across the sea.”

29:17.105 --> 29:19.720
The sea will reply, “First remove those stones tied to your feet

29:19.745 --> 29:22.667
otherwise how shall I carry you across?”

29:22.692 --> 29:26.384
To your feet you have tied these huge rocks, it is better to get rid of them

29:26.409 --> 29:27.226
and if you can’t cut them off

29:27.251 --> 29:34.033
then at least do this – keep yourself away from these.

29:34.090 --> 29:36.723
All these types of things that you have tied to your feet

29:36.748 --> 29:39.464
you must break these completely and rise higher.

29:39.489 --> 29:43.922
Tell them, “ You do Whatever you want to do, have nothing to do with us”.

29:43.947 --> 29:46.776
Because there are so many more such badhas

29:46.801 --> 29:50.489
and attaching these unnecessary badhas as well is of no use.

29:50.514 --> 29:55.630
Look at the way, these trees hold such a heavy fruit so high.

29:55.655 --> 30:03.179
How heavy is this fruit? It has water inside. It holds this fruit high.

30:03.204 --> 30:07.782
In the same way you have to hold your head high.

30:07.807 --> 30:10.988
And while holding it high, remember that

30:11.013 --> 30:13.625
the head should be respectfully bowed towards the sea.

30:13.650 --> 30:20.089
It has to be reverently and humbly bowed towards the Dharma.

30:20.114 --> 30:22.114
Many Sahaja Yogis do not understand at all

30:22.139 --> 30:24.229
that unless we have fully settled in the dharma

30:24.254 --> 30:26.346
we just cannot be Sahaja Yogis.

30:26.371 --> 30:28.345
They go on making mistakes of every type.

30:28.370 --> 30:32.551
For example, many people take tobacco, smoke cigarettes, drink liquor

30:32.576 --> 30:35.779
keep doing all this and then say, “We have not progressed in Sahaja Yoga.”

30:35.804 --> 30:40.094
Then how can that be? You yourself are after your own life.

30:40.119 --> 30:42.278
There are some small-rules in Sahaja Yoga

30:42.303 --> 30:43.514
very simple and straight forward ones.

30:43.539 --> 30:44.942
You have been given the power to follow these.

30:44.967 --> 30:49.946
Use them fully in your behaviour and communication.

30:49.971 --> 30:52.801
And the biggest thing that is expressed in the bowing of the trees

30:52.826 --> 30:57.776
is to be humbly bowed and to make that love shine from within.

30:57.801 --> 30:59.360
Whatever you have received from Divine

30:59.385 --> 31:02.246
while surrendering that love to  Divine

31:02.271 --> 31:05.683
we should keep in mind that we have love towards everyone.

31:05.708 --> 31:07.229
Finally, it should be said

31:07.254 --> 31:11.452
that the brain or the Sahastrara in which there is no love

31:11.477 --> 31:13.694
there I do not reside.

31:13.719 --> 31:15.899
Only the idea of love should occur in the mind.

31:15.924 --> 31:20.458
And what is to be done to manifest and radiate this love?

31:20.483 --> 31:23.360
If you reflect deeply, you will know that I am saying the same thing

31:23.385 --> 31:25.821
how can we fill our hearts with love?

31:25.846 --> 31:29.004
We should only think, “Am i doing it in love?

31:29.029 --> 31:32.755
Am i doing it in love? Am i doing everything in love?

31:32.780 --> 31:37.785
Is everything, my talking and all my activities, being done in love?”

31:37.810 --> 31:40.648
You can even beat someone in love, there is no harm in that.

31:40.673 --> 31:43.899
If there is something false we can beat the person, there is no harm.

31:43.924 --> 31:45.540
But is it happening in love?

31:45.565 --> 31:48.716
Devi killed so many Rakshasas (demons) out of love only.

31:48.741 --> 31:53.562
And so, in order that they may not further deteriorate from Rakshas to Maharakshas

31:53.587 --> 31:55.962
and also because of Her love for Her bhaktas, in order to save them

31:55.987 --> 31:57.536
She killed the Rakshasas.

31:57.564 --> 32:00.369
In her infinite power also, it is the power of Love that is working.

32:00.394 --> 32:02.718
That which is benevolent is love.

32:02.743 --> 32:05.604
So are you expressing that sort of love that is benevolent to them?

32:05.629 --> 32:06.774
This has to be understood.

32:06.799 --> 32:08.150
And if you are really doing that

32:08.175 --> 32:09.715
then you have accomplished and established that thing

32:09.740 --> 32:12.107
What I was saying is that harmony should be achieved.

32:12.132 --> 32:13.890
So that harmony has been established within you.

32:13.915 --> 32:16.803
There is only one Shakti (power) which we may call ‘love’.

32:16.828 --> 32:19.682
And it is only love that shapes all things

32:19.707 --> 32:22.934
to become beautiful, shapely and fully organized.

32:22.959 --> 32:26.209
That which is just dry thought, has no meaning.

32:26.234 --> 32:31.518
And you know that dry thought comes only from ego.

32:31.543 --> 32:33.699
And the second thing which comes from super-ego

32:33.724 --> 32:37.881
may well make it look beautiful from the outside

32:37.906 --> 32:39.661
but it is quite hollow inside.

32:39.686 --> 32:45.311
Therefore, one thing is dirty but dry, the other thing looks beautiful

32:45.336 --> 32:48.754
but is incapable of giving any joy, is absolutely hollow.

32:48.780 --> 32:51.152
One is without joy and the other quite hollow.

32:51.177 --> 32:53.939
The concord between these two is not possible to be attained in any way

32:53.963 --> 32:58.349
because they are in opposition to each other.

32:58.374 --> 33:03.719
But after realization and after coming to Sahaja Yoga

33:03.744 --> 33:07.041
all contrariness which appeared to be in opposition to each other

33:07.066 --> 33:10.550
seem to become as if they are two parts of one thing only.

33:10.575 --> 33:12.894
And this happening should take place within you.

33:12.919 --> 33:16.451
Only the day when this happening takes place within us, we can accept

33:16.476 --> 33:22.323
that we have fully celebrated the 14th birthday of our Sahastrara.

33:22.348 --> 33:24.402
May God bless you!

33:24.427 --> 33:26.175
On this auspicious occasion

33:26.200 --> 33:30.234
on my own behalf, on behalf of all the Devatas and on behalf of Paramatma

33:30.259 --> 33:34.757
Infinite blessings to you all!
