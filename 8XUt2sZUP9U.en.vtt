00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:12.366
Shri Ganesha is the Lord of Innocence.

00:00:18.394 --> 00:00:25.224
He is the ocean of innocence.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.620
And though' he is

00:00:30.514 --> 00:00:36.594
such a young, little boy,

00:00:39.827 --> 00:00:44.417
he can fight the whole world,

00:00:47.344 --> 00:00:53.344
he can destroy all the negativity.

00:00:55.697 --> 00:00:59.947
That's the sign of innocence.

00:01:04.653 --> 00:01:07.124
There have been stories

00:01:07.344 --> 00:01:12.132
that children who have fallen from a very great height

00:01:12.394 --> 00:01:16.547
were completely saved, nothing happened to them.

00:01:18.853 --> 00:01:25.831
Their innocence is such a powerful thing

00:01:28.304 --> 00:01:32.342
that it doesn't harm anyone

00:01:33.264 --> 00:01:36.994
who is not to be harmed.

00:01:39.184 --> 00:01:42.694
It has all the wisdom of the world,

00:01:43.094 --> 00:01:46.956
all the understanding of the world;

00:01:47.184 --> 00:01:54.711
and anybody who tries to harm the innocence,

00:01:55.304 --> 00:01:59.323
the world, the whole world –

00:02:00.094 --> 00:02:05.974
which may not have cared so much for innocence,

00:02:06.434 --> 00:02:09.474
might not have worshiped innocence so much –

00:02:09.594 --> 00:02:14.621
but they all stand, stand up against

00:02:15.144 --> 00:02:21.094
anybody who tries to harm the innocence.

00:02:24.887 --> 00:02:29.797
You can see in your own lives

00:02:30.264 --> 00:02:36.434
around you, anybody tries to trouble children –

00:02:36.554 --> 00:02:40.934
all of the them, whatever they are,

00:02:41.054 --> 00:02:43.474
whatever they are coming from,

00:02:43.594 --> 00:02:46.668
whatever maybe their nationality,

00:02:46.788 --> 00:02:52.144
they all jump, all jump to control

00:02:52.264 --> 00:02:55.033
and to safeguard that child.

00:02:58.466 --> 00:03:07.774
One thing about Shri Ganesha is that He worships His Mother

00:03:08.706 --> 00:03:14.796
Motherhood is very important.

00:03:14.916 --> 00:03:28.649
Motherhood in the women, motherhood in the father and also in the children

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:38.254
has to be accepted as the mainstay of family life and society.

00:03:41.784 --> 00:03:58.698
The ordinary life of a human being - very simple,
innocent, simple people - revolves around the mother.

00:03:59.535 --> 00:04:07.110
It revolves, but the mothers have to be mothers.

00:04:10.178 --> 00:04:20.555
As Shri Ganesha is so much surrendered to
His Mother

00:04:20.675 --> 00:04:24.869
and who is His Mother? Is Adi Shakti.

00:04:25.009 --> 00:04:32.404
He does not know anybody else, just knows His Mother.

00:04:32.579 --> 00:04:36.677
First and foremost thing that is to be understood,

00:04:36.798 --> 00:04:42.555
that innocence should be respected,

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:51.715
looked after, nourished and protected.

00:04:51.836 --> 00:04:58.740
That's why I'm very particular about the children.

00:04:58.861 --> 00:05:03.662
Children should not be exposed to the public.

00:05:04.142 --> 00:05:10.605
We should not try to make photographs
out of our children and expose them

00:05:10.725 --> 00:05:15.452
in the newspaper or give them
for advertisement or anything there.

00:05:17.679 --> 00:05:23.929
Is a very wrong idea to expose your children

00:05:26.457 --> 00:05:32.593
to gain some money out of them in any way,

00:05:32.714 --> 00:05:38.508
in the smallest way also, because
we are selling the innocence,

00:05:38.628 --> 00:05:41.701
the innocence which is invaluable,

00:05:41.821 --> 00:05:49.063
Also we have to look after our children with great care.

00:05:49.064 --> 00:05:53.526
But we go to two extremes, I have seen.

00:05:53.660 --> 00:06:02.102
Some people are only worried about their own children.
If anything happens to them, just get upset.

00:06:02.337 --> 00:06:06.794
That means you are respecting your child because he's your child.

00:06:06.914 --> 00:06:11.267
But if you are respecting him because he carries
innocence with him,

00:06:11.387 --> 00:06:16.049
then you have to respect every child

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:23.172
and understand every child - what
they talk, what they say, how they behave.

00:06:23.293 --> 00:06:27.592
Luckily, you all have got children now who are born-realized.

00:06:27.713 --> 00:06:30.635
It's such a great thing, such a blessing.

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:40.829
Now for the other Sahaja Yogis who are grown up and
who are very mature,

00:06:41.001 --> 00:06:46.840
they are very innocent, I must say.
I must admit that. They're very innocent

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:50.340
compared to the society that is around.
No doubt.

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:56.702
One has to really admire the
way they have become so innocent,

00:06:56.822 --> 00:07:03.862
the way they're understanding this divine music and all.
That's really creditable.

00:07:03.983 --> 00:07:10.533
But still, this innocence, if it is not spread,

00:07:10.653 --> 00:07:17.555
if this innocence doesn't work
out, then it will rust, will not grow.

00:07:17.782 --> 00:07:25.081
Now you know how to do it.
It is the power of Kundalini with the help of Shri Ganesh.

00:07:25.201 --> 00:07:27.722
He helps you at every chakra.

00:07:27.842 --> 00:07:33.184
I have written that He's the Vice Chancellor of every university, where He has to stamp.

00:07:33.304 --> 00:07:40.042
He's at every point, but you have to understand

00:07:40.162 --> 00:07:48.614
that this has to spread. It has to
become collective. It has to flow.

00:07:48.734 --> 00:07:56.934
So to become that, what should we do ourselves?

00:07:57.055 --> 00:08:06.810
That we should try to organize programs.

00:08:07.059 --> 00:08:10.422
While people will be enamored by your innocence, no doubt.

00:08:10.542 --> 00:08:13.852
They'll be surprised how are you so innocent.

00:08:13.972 --> 00:08:19.737
How can you be so nice in these modern times?
No doubt about it.

00:08:19.857 --> 00:08:26.691
But, in that doing, that so, try to be innocent yourself.

00:08:26.811 --> 00:08:30.072
Should not be cunning.
You should not be smart.

00:08:30.192 --> 00:08:34.935
You should not try to show that
you are very brilliant or anything;

00:08:35.055 --> 00:08:41.331
because the ego might, in between, come
and try to put ideas into your head.

00:08:41.451 --> 00:08:48.129
It's better to show that you're innocent and to be innocent inside.

00:08:48.249 --> 00:08:57.831
The whole inner being can be really charged with the energy of Shri Ganesh, no doubt,

00:08:57.951 --> 00:09:01.962
and the outer life becomes innocent.

00:09:02.082 --> 00:09:09.643
So depend on your inner power and manifest it outside.

00:09:09.763 --> 00:09:15.414
Inner being, which is Ganesha, is the same in all of us.

00:09:15.534 --> 00:09:19.003
The whole system is the same in all of us.

00:09:19.123 --> 00:09:22.192
Chakras are the same in all of us.

00:09:22.312 --> 00:09:27.499
Only thing, we have to keep our innocence

00:09:27.619 --> 00:09:38.231
absolutely free of all this worldly nonsense like a fashion, this, that.

00:09:38.352 --> 00:09:44.106
Immediately, you'll find that your being will manifest.

00:09:45.703 --> 00:09:55.009
So today, at this puja, I would bless you with all
the qualities of Shri Ganesha—except for His anger.

00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:58.060
May God bless you.
