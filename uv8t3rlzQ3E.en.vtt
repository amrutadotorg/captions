00:00:26.221 --> 00:00:29.008
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:00:35.501 --> 00:00:38.031
Today, in these modern times

00:00:40.121 --> 00:00:42.037
we are face to face

00:00:42.943 --> 00:00:45.225
with lots of complicated problems

00:00:48.455 --> 00:00:51.053
lots of shocks that are awaiting us.

00:00:53.196 --> 00:00:54.196
And then we

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:57.710
look back

00:00:58.668 --> 00:00:59.668
to understand

00:01:00.576 --> 00:01:03.010
why have we failed?

00:01:04.063 --> 00:01:06.797
What has gone wrong with all of us?

00:01:07.537 --> 00:01:10.398
 Whatever way the human beings have moved

00:01:11.433 --> 00:01:12.533
in whatever direction

00:01:13.487 --> 00:01:15.609
they have tried to

00:01:16.142 --> 00:01:17.242
achieve something

00:01:17.818 --> 00:01:20.547
the whole thing has recoiled on the whole humanity

00:01:20.748 --> 00:01:23.249
 and has destroyed it.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.601
One must stop at this point

00:01:28.115 --> 00:01:30.391
and witness the reason

00:01:30.845 --> 00:01:33.912
the basic reason, what mistake we have committed.

00:01:35.488 --> 00:01:38.285
We talk of love, we talk of peace

00:01:39.364 --> 00:01:40.264
world peace.

00:01:41.323 --> 00:01:43.247
 But the peace is not in your hearts.

00:01:44.274 --> 00:01:45.578
Peace is not within.

00:01:46.261 --> 00:01:47.614
You are in a turmoil

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:50.528
and how can you bring forth peace all over?

00:01:53.077 --> 00:01:54.077
If the

00:01:55.066 --> 00:01:56.929
sea is full of waves

00:01:57.974 --> 00:01:59.351
which are in a turmoil

00:01:59.905 --> 00:02:04.234
how do you expect the boat to be steady?

00:02:05.276 --> 00:02:06.376
The reason is

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:08.678
we are not

00:02:09.586 --> 00:02:11.788
trying to find out what is wrong with us.

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.348
But we are all the time trying to find out

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:16.459
what is wrong with others.

00:02:16.928 --> 00:02:17.828
But who is the other?

00:02:19.272 --> 00:02:21.553
We are all part and parcel of one

00:02:22.514 --> 00:02:23.514
Great World.

00:02:23.803 --> 00:02:25.556
God has not created many countries.

00:02:25.894 --> 00:02:27.411
He never knew about these things.

00:02:28.744 --> 00:02:31.202
He will be surprised if He visits His world.

00:02:31.473 --> 00:02:33.071
He will be surprised the way we have

00:02:33.272 --> 00:02:34.453
divided ourselves into countries

00:02:34.494 --> 00:02:35.831
countries, countries

00:02:36.032 --> 00:02:38.196
and from one country to another country

00:02:38.397 --> 00:02:41.326
you move like a criminal with a passport number.

00:02:44.925 --> 00:02:49.235
This idea of love is not love.

00:02:50.014 --> 00:02:53.113
This conception, the mental projection

00:02:53.812 --> 00:02:57.264
that we call love is not love at all.

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:04.574
The love is something which is a power.

00:03:06.671 --> 00:03:10.857
A power that is looking after us

00:03:11.936 --> 00:03:14.146
the power that is guiding us

00:03:15.327 --> 00:03:19.370
the power that has nourished us, has brought us to this level.

00:03:19.685 --> 00:03:23.799
We in our ego human beings think that we have done this

00:03:23.941 --> 00:03:24.854
we have done that.

00:03:25.325 --> 00:03:26.863
You have done nothing.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.630
You can't even create a blade of grass.

00:03:34.018 --> 00:03:37.243
You cannot ! Can you?

00:03:38.222 --> 00:03:41.558
You cannot create anything that is living.

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:48.844
Then why say that, "We have done this, we have done that"?

00:03:49.161 --> 00:03:50.621
you have done nothing

00:03:50.885 --> 00:03:54.984
 but you have created all kinds of devils out of your cocoons

00:03:55.617 --> 00:03:57.471
and put them on top of your heads.

00:03:58.027 --> 00:04:00.059
First let us be humble about it

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.961
then we can understand what is love of God.

00:04:05.621 --> 00:04:10.070
Love of God is a power, it is all pervading power.

00:04:11.779 --> 00:04:13.713
It is the subtle power

00:04:14.625 --> 00:04:18.502
which resides in all the elements

00:04:20.423 --> 00:04:24.819
in all the molecules, in all the atoms.

00:04:27.262 --> 00:04:31.511
The vibrations that you see say in a sulphur dioxide

00:04:32.491 --> 00:04:33.561
when you see the

00:04:34.048 --> 00:04:40.768
isometric movement of the atoms

00:04:40.807 --> 00:04:44.472
then know it is the love of God which is watching it.

00:04:48.057 --> 00:04:50.987
Now it is easy to say that it is no love of God.

00:04:51.911 --> 00:04:55.304
But this is not very scientific way of looking at things.

00:04:55.946 --> 00:04:58.712
If you are scientific minded

00:05:00.284 --> 00:05:03.256
then, you have to understand this is the hypothesis

00:05:03.457 --> 00:05:05.122
which I am putting before you.

00:05:05.438 --> 00:05:07.965
And if it is not proved then you can deny.

00:05:08.294 --> 00:05:11.206
Uptil now I would have accepted that you said there is no God

00:05:11.407 --> 00:05:12.848
but that also is not scientific

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:14.239
because you have not seen yet.

00:05:14.692 --> 00:05:16.401
You have not gone into that direction.

00:05:16.487 --> 00:05:17.867
 You have not tried to find it out.

00:05:18.068 --> 00:05:19.952
How can you say there is no God?

00:05:20.043 --> 00:05:22.920
Only because in your small little brain

00:05:23.456 --> 00:05:26.523
you have conceived an idea that there is no God.

00:05:28.417 --> 00:05:31.902
So, secondly you have to have an open mind

00:05:32.646 --> 00:05:35.806
to understand God's love.

00:05:36.589 --> 00:05:38.171
A very open mind

00:05:38.766 --> 00:05:41.917
open mind like a student who goes to the university

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:46.415
doesn't challenge a professor, but sits down to listen

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:49.983
to find out what the professor has to teach.

00:05:52.861 --> 00:05:53.961
Thirdly,

00:05:56.168 --> 00:06:00.020
we must understand that we know very little

00:06:01.106 --> 00:06:03.340
very very little, wee bit.

00:06:04.205 --> 00:06:07.876
We are using a very weebit of our brain to understand it.

00:06:08.779 --> 00:06:11.157
so, whatever so called knowledge we have got

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:14.135
is absolutely a limited knowledge.

00:06:14.283 --> 00:06:18.028
May be it is just ignorance or may be something mythical.

00:06:18.872 --> 00:06:20.574
Let us keep it as a hypothesis.

00:06:23.006 --> 00:06:24.213
Now, I say

00:06:26.666 --> 00:06:27.799
that there is God

00:06:29.229 --> 00:06:33.638
and I say that His love is all pervading.

00:06:35.636 --> 00:06:39.122
All the great saints, incarnations, prophets

00:06:39.846 --> 00:06:41.774
all the great religions have said this.

00:06:41.975 --> 00:06:43.761
I am not saying this for the first time.

00:06:44.117 --> 00:06:49.192
I am only here to prove that they have said it, is the truth

00:06:49.446 --> 00:06:52.537
and you can find out whether it is the truth or not.

00:06:53.545 --> 00:06:55.406
But you should be the seekers of truth

00:06:55.607 --> 00:06:58.561
and not just intellectuals or some sort of

00:06:59.506 --> 00:07:01.256
argumentative personalities.

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:05.441
Try to understand that at human level you have not been able to

00:07:05.642 --> 00:07:09.982
 discover that great power of love, is a fact, must accept.

00:07:12.096 --> 00:07:15.368
You have not been able to feel God's love.

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:20.515
Or you might have read a lot, but you have had no experience of God.

00:07:21.389 --> 00:07:23.480
You have never felt His love

00:07:24.275 --> 00:07:29.592
Then, one must know that we have been ignorant.

00:07:29.996 --> 00:07:34.898
The darkness of ignorance has been on us

00:07:35.148 --> 00:07:37.818
and in darkness we are eating each other

00:07:38.293 --> 00:07:41.567
You have no idea as to how we are related to each other.

00:07:42.357 --> 00:07:46.082
It is a crazy world we are creating today because of this darkness.

00:07:46.761 --> 00:07:48.446
This darkness has to go away.

00:07:48.878 --> 00:07:53.401
And for that the light of God's love has to come.

00:07:56.053 --> 00:07:59.953
Now the question could be, how can we know God?

00:08:01.955 --> 00:08:04.661
Because as it is, we are like a cocoon.

00:08:06.351 --> 00:08:09.723
We have taken out all these traits of the cocoon

00:08:10.842 --> 00:08:11.942
put them round us

00:08:12.658 --> 00:08:16.217
and everybody thinks that they have produced some sort of a

00:08:16.457 --> 00:08:19.135
novel ideology or a philosophy

00:08:19.942 --> 00:08:21.608
which will solve all the problems of the world.

00:08:22.059 --> 00:08:24.257
It has not, it has created more complications,

00:08:24.458 --> 00:08:26.422
more complications and more complications.

00:08:26.707 --> 00:08:27.807
Let us face it.

00:08:30.368 --> 00:08:33.752
How to get out of this cocoon is the problem today?

00:08:34.509 --> 00:08:36.362
And to get out of this cocoon

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:38.800
what should we do?

00:08:39.385 --> 00:08:41.855
Normally as human beings we always think

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:45.802
 that by doing something only we achieve the results.

00:08:46.533 --> 00:08:47.433
But this is the other way round.

00:08:50.402 --> 00:08:54.640
When we became human beings from ameba stage what did we do?

00:08:56.921 --> 00:09:00.032
From monkeys to human beings what did we do?

00:09:00.691 --> 00:09:02.987
We didn't do anything. Did we?

00:09:03.188 --> 00:09:05.721
But there was some internal force

00:09:05.922 --> 00:09:08.286
 that has brought forth this  revolution.

00:09:11.511 --> 00:09:14.030
Now when something has happened

00:09:15.199 --> 00:09:16.790
without our effort

00:09:17.815 --> 00:09:20.485
then it must be something unique.

00:09:21.402 --> 00:09:24.403
But it is nothing. Everyday we see it.

00:09:24.688 --> 00:09:28.104
For example, a flower becomes a fruit. You see it every day.

00:09:29.423 --> 00:09:30.523
And you accept it.

00:09:32.402 --> 00:09:35.320
You never challenge, how it has become suddenly

00:09:35.709 --> 00:09:37.517
the flower becoming a fruit

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:39.631
because it is a living process.

00:09:42.043 --> 00:09:44.756
So the living process

00:09:47.378 --> 00:09:49.104
of the living God

00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:53.964
comes from His love, which is living.

00:09:56.264 --> 00:09:57.926
Dead Gods I am not talking about

00:09:58.127 --> 00:10:00.165
which we have made out of our own brains.

00:10:01.028 --> 00:10:04.873
But real God, the reality itself

00:10:06.911 --> 00:10:11.549
which is not created by you, He has created us.

00:10:12.516 --> 00:10:14.496
When He has created us

00:10:14.807 --> 00:10:16.919
We cannot put in effort to know Him.

00:10:17.256 --> 00:10:20.442
He has to put in effort for us to know Him.

00:10:21.991 --> 00:10:24.812
So, He has put in all the efforts within yourself

00:10:25.773 --> 00:10:26.869
very beautifully.

00:10:29.182 --> 00:10:31.749
In the different stages of your evolution,

00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:34.530
He has

00:10:37.285 --> 00:10:40.471
developed within you a mechanism

00:10:40.721 --> 00:10:43.621
a beautiful living mechanism

00:10:45.639 --> 00:10:48.031
which has given you the state

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:50.844
 upto which you have come up as a human beings

00:10:51.306 --> 00:10:55.619
and also the possibility of becoming a higher being

00:10:56.167 --> 00:10:57.067
through that mechanism.

00:11:00.271 --> 00:11:02.869
Now if you want to know through science , you cannot.

00:11:04.347 --> 00:11:06.318
By all human efforts

00:11:08.207 --> 00:11:11.171
whatever you try is the knowledge of the tree.

00:11:12.406 --> 00:11:15.481
But if you have to have the knowledge of the roots

00:11:16.646 --> 00:11:20.396
you have to become a subtler personality to get to it.

00:11:24.135 --> 00:11:26.155
Even to become that

00:11:28.907 --> 00:11:31.966
God has made all beautiful arrangements within us.

00:11:34.786 --> 00:11:37.337
In the west I would say

00:11:37.524 --> 00:11:39.940
on the scientific field you reached

00:11:40.901 --> 00:11:44.539
quite daring but he made little mistakes

00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:48.510
because He didn't have a Mother to tell him perhaps.

00:11:49.856 --> 00:11:53.105
So, he made a very big mistake

00:11:53.706 --> 00:11:56.027
by saying that the unconscious

00:11:57.412 --> 00:12:01.378
is below the subconscious mind.

00:12:03.351 --> 00:12:05.220
And then is the conscious mind

00:12:09.741 --> 00:12:12.189
which we call (SUPHTA CHETAN).

00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:15.870
Which is Sakhshat Kundalini.

00:12:18.905 --> 00:12:20.005
This Kundalini

00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:29.511
according to him was placed  under the layers of these minds.

00:12:30.654 --> 00:12:35.224
God is a great creator and a planner.

00:12:36.803 --> 00:12:39.156
Supposing you have to

00:12:40.709 --> 00:12:43.213
enter into an airport

00:12:43.348 --> 00:12:46.836
and there are piles of luggage, one after another and everything

00:12:47.037 --> 00:12:49.946
piled one after the other like that, how will you reach?

00:12:51.245 --> 00:12:53.066
There has to be a path.

00:12:55.214 --> 00:12:58.995
So, this argument of his has failed him completely.

00:12:59.539 --> 00:13:02.637
But actually it is not placed one on top of another

00:13:02.925 --> 00:13:04.025
but on parallel sides.

00:13:06.215 --> 00:13:08.718
On the left hand side and the right hand side.

00:13:09.439 --> 00:13:13.268
On the left hand side, we have the subconscious.

00:13:14.351 --> 00:13:18.386
The present subconscious is like subconscious

00:13:18.897 --> 00:13:22.389
many lives' subconscious and then the collective subconscious.

00:13:23.156 --> 00:13:27.850
On the right hand side we have got supraconscious, the present one

00:13:28.405 --> 00:13:29.639
this life's

00:13:30.427 --> 00:13:32.347
then of many lives

00:13:32.604 --> 00:13:36.123
and then last of all is the collective supraconscious.

00:13:37.344 --> 00:13:39.713
Now the supraconscious means the futuristic

00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:42.884
the futuristic ideas of people.

00:13:44.283 --> 00:13:46.620
So, we have two types of people already

00:13:47.166 --> 00:13:50.662
one are which are left sided which live with their past

00:13:52.198 --> 00:13:55.813
one which are right sided which live with the future.

00:13:55.989 --> 00:13:59.444
We can say in India we are the people live more with the past.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.035
We talk of Shivaji but what about today?

00:14:02.236 --> 00:14:04.617
Can we produce someone like him?

00:14:07.564 --> 00:14:11.297
We talk of Nanaka. Can we produce anyone like Him?

00:14:13.262 --> 00:14:16.615
We talk of Kabira. Can we produce anyone like Him?

00:14:17.182 --> 00:14:19.773
With all this nonsense that is going on

00:14:20.589 --> 00:14:23.973
can we produce even one like them? We cannot.

00:14:25.575 --> 00:14:26.899
So no use talking about them.

00:14:27.175 --> 00:14:30.104
Better see what you can do today in the present.

00:14:31.508 --> 00:14:33.638
So in the present is the central path

00:14:34.473 --> 00:14:37.961
which we call in the Sanskrit language as Maha Laxmi's.

00:14:39.947 --> 00:14:43.277
This central path is the evolutionary path of the human beings.

00:14:44.267 --> 00:14:47.675
And thus all the centers that are created within us

00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:51.699
are the different stages in which a human being has gone through.

00:14:52.272 --> 00:14:55.315
For example, the first one which is called as the Mooladhara

00:14:55.782 --> 00:14:56.882
which you see there

00:14:57.995 --> 00:15:01.416
is the one, that starts with carbon.

00:15:02.323 --> 00:15:05.834
With the carbon coming into the evolutionary process

00:15:06.404 --> 00:15:08.863
amino acids were formed.

00:15:09.064 --> 00:15:11.732
Iife took its own existence

00:15:11.933 --> 00:15:13.234
 and life stared running.

00:15:15.339 --> 00:15:16.352
So basically,

00:15:16.744 --> 00:15:20.328
we have started from that stage, going higher, higher, higher.

00:15:20.805 --> 00:15:22.919
Till now we have come to the human stage

00:15:23.798 --> 00:15:27.357
and last is this chakra which we call

00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:31.963
in the medical science as limbic area, Sahastrara.

00:15:32.884 --> 00:15:35.989
The end of it is called as the Bramharandra

00:15:36.058 --> 00:15:38.942
in the fontanelle bone area in the medical terminology

00:15:39.423 --> 00:15:42.907
and this is a soft bone in childhood

00:15:43.822 --> 00:15:46.151
which gets covered up because

00:15:46.971 --> 00:15:51.236
of the two institutions growing into us of ego and superego.

00:15:53.142 --> 00:15:55.868
When the kundalini rises through these centers

00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:58.532
She pierces through this seventh center

00:15:59.802 --> 00:16:02.345
and you get that higher awareness

00:16:02.534 --> 00:16:06.189
which we call as Yogis or Sahajyogis.

00:16:08.174 --> 00:16:10.614
These days there are so many types of yogis moving.

00:16:10.979 --> 00:16:12.966
That is why we call it Sahajyogis,

00:16:13.167 --> 00:16:14.944
but all real yogis are Sahajyogis.

00:16:16.589 --> 00:16:22.350
It is a spontaneous happening because it is a living process.

00:16:23.336 --> 00:16:26.357
Living process is a spontaneous happening.

00:16:27.909 --> 00:16:30.603
Once people asked Ramadasa,

00:16:31.025 --> 00:16:33.870
"How much time does it take for kundalini to rise?"

00:16:34.344 --> 00:16:36.475
He said TAT CHHAN, (that moment).

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.268
Guru Nanaka has said," Sahaja Samadhi lago".

00:16:41.944 --> 00:16:42.973
" Sahaja Samadhi lago".

00:16:43.174 --> 00:16:46.381
He has described, Sahaja Samadhi lago, clearly.

00:16:48.051 --> 00:16:49.530
What more he should say?

00:16:51.563 --> 00:16:55.159
Kabira has said," Ida pingala sukhman nadi mein".

00:16:56.349 --> 00:16:58.769
They all have described the same thing.

00:16:59.048 --> 00:17:00.336
In the Bible it is written,

00:17:00.947 --> 00:17:04.990
"I will appear before you like tongues of flames".

00:17:05.223 --> 00:17:07.361
No one can explain what does that mean.

00:17:07.798 --> 00:17:12.265
Christ has said ,"I will come back as a comforter, as a Holy Ghost".

00:17:12.466 --> 00:17:14.350
If you ask somebody, who is Holy Ghost?

00:17:15.692 --> 00:17:17.286
They say we don't know, that is a mystery.

00:17:17.463 --> 00:17:19.501
Everything is a mystery, then what is the use of having such a

00:17:19.755 --> 00:17:21.596
 mysterious ideas.

00:17:22.821 --> 00:17:24.658
Why do you accept anything that is mysterious?

00:17:25.837 --> 00:17:29.339
Holy Ghost is nothing but it is the kundalini within you.

00:17:30.938 --> 00:17:34.605
She is the reflection of the Primordial Mother

00:17:35.032 --> 00:17:37.329
who is within you in the triangular bone.

00:17:37.974 --> 00:17:39.890
She is kept there all the time.

00:17:40.423 --> 00:17:48.162
That is the power which is, what we call is the power of

00:17:50.254 --> 00:17:52.781
Shuddah Iccha.

00:17:52.982 --> 00:17:55.613
Pure desire, pure desire.

00:17:55.990 --> 00:17:57.922
What is the pure desire we have?

00:17:58.149 --> 00:18:01.541
Is that we have to become one with this all pervading power.

00:18:01.842 --> 00:18:02.742
This is the pure desire.

00:18:03.015 --> 00:18:05.465
All other desires come and go.

00:18:05.650 --> 00:18:09.466
Today they are asking say for something.

00:18:09.625 --> 00:18:11.208
Tomorrow they will ask for something.

00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:13.631
Day after tommorow they will ask for something.

00:18:13.832 --> 00:18:15.782
It will go on and go on and go on.

00:18:16.497 --> 00:18:19.334
But once you get to your pure desire

00:18:19.595 --> 00:18:21.441
you don't want to ask for anything.

00:18:21.723 --> 00:18:22.623
Then you give.

00:18:23.530 --> 00:18:26.335
Then you don't ask. You don't want anything, you want to give.

00:18:27.061 --> 00:18:29.876
This is the situation which we should arrive at

00:18:30.077 --> 00:18:32.172
 that we have to give.

00:18:32.373 --> 00:18:34.377
When we say that we have to become the light

00:18:34.804 --> 00:18:35.656
then you become the light.

00:18:35.857 --> 00:18:36.890
What does the light do?

00:18:37.101 --> 00:18:38.001
Light gives.

00:18:38.787 --> 00:18:41.567
Till it becomes the light all the problems are there.

00:18:41.734 --> 00:18:44.047
As soon as it becomes light, it gives.

00:18:44.909 --> 00:18:48.810
In the same way, there is full arrangement within us.

00:18:49.450 --> 00:18:54.223
In a living process the kundalini has to rise

00:18:55.545 --> 00:18:59.656
and give you your self realisation, your self knowledge

00:18:59.763 --> 00:19:02.366
which is the BODHA, which is the VEDAS.

00:19:02.567 --> 00:19:03.967
VED means VIDH.

00:19:04.167 --> 00:19:07.667
To know within yourself means on your central nervous system

00:19:07.833 --> 00:19:11.267
not reading, not reading.

00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:15.335
Kabira has said, (" PADHI PADHI PANDIT MOORAKH BHAYYA").

00:19:15.779 --> 00:19:19.906
He said by reading too much, the great learned have become stupid.

00:19:20.821 --> 00:19:21.821
That is a fact.

00:19:22.238 --> 00:19:26.071
Because when you read, everybody else is in your head, you are lost.

00:19:26.539 --> 00:19:29.178
Now when the self knowledge comes into you

00:19:30.975 --> 00:19:32.522
then what happens?

00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:36.385
When self knowledge is there, you know about yourself.

00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:38.440
You don't know anything about yourself.

00:19:40.086 --> 00:19:42.899
For example, somebody who is sick

00:19:43.988 --> 00:19:46.353
he says,"Oh! I was quite alright

00:19:46.555 --> 00:19:49.436
and suddenly i find i have got bone marrow cancer".

00:19:49.882 --> 00:19:51.111
He never knew,no nothing.

00:19:51.312 --> 00:19:53.411
 Suddenly they say now i have bone marrow cancer.

00:19:53.705 --> 00:19:56.201
I am walking about alright. I am perfectly alright.

00:19:57.406 --> 00:19:58.506
He did not know.

00:19:59.067 --> 00:20:01.398
Somebody says,"My son was alright,

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:03.614
suddenly he has turned out to be epiliptic".

00:20:04.123 --> 00:20:08.293
Another one says,"My daughter was alright. Now she is a lunatic."

00:20:09.564 --> 00:20:11.232
How it has happened, we don't know?

00:20:11.457 --> 00:20:13.681
Suddenly, something has gone down with the machine.

00:20:14.864 --> 00:20:18.706
We know more about the motorcar that we drive the machinery

00:20:19.579 --> 00:20:21.401
 much less about this our machinery

00:20:21.602 --> 00:20:23.280
which is so beautiful and so subtle.

00:20:25.922 --> 00:20:28.449
To know this you have to become the knower.

00:20:28.713 --> 00:20:32.204
And the knower is the spirit, where you have to reach.

00:20:32.254 --> 00:20:34.613
But for that you don't have to do anything.

00:20:34.836 --> 00:20:37.086
Kundilini has to do some job

00:20:37.333 --> 00:20:40.455
and that job is simple because She is your Mother.

00:20:41.246 --> 00:20:44.224
She has been your mother all your lives

00:20:44.868 --> 00:20:48.170
and now she wants to give you your second birth.

00:20:49.106 --> 00:20:50.125
That you have to have.

00:20:50.379 --> 00:20:53.287
It is no use certfying yourself twice born

00:20:53.818 --> 00:20:58.115
or say that I am a person, who has got realisation.

00:20:59.130 --> 00:21:01.459
It is no use deceiving yourself, no use.

00:21:02.577 --> 00:21:05.652
When you get your realisation , the first thing that happens to you

00:21:05.763 --> 00:21:08.815
the first and foremost thing that will happen to you

00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:11.874
that on your central nervous system

00:21:12.190 --> 00:21:14.368
you will develop a new dimension

00:21:15.162 --> 00:21:18.229
of collective consciousness.

00:21:19.629 --> 00:21:22.640
A new depth on your central nervous system

00:21:23.206 --> 00:21:26.408
you can feel your own centers and the centers of others

00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:30.610
on your five fingers and six and seven centers.

00:21:32.008 --> 00:21:32.936
This has to happen.

00:21:33.137 --> 00:21:34.822
The one who thinks I know a lot,

00:21:35.023 --> 00:21:37.595
i am a great pandit, i am this and that

00:21:37.832 --> 00:21:40.330
 I think all of them are on their way to Narak (Hell).

00:21:41.566 --> 00:21:43.876
Only the way to rise

00:21:44.077 --> 00:21:48.215
 is to ascend through kundailini awakening, there is no other way.

00:21:48.915 --> 00:21:52.470
Some people think that we have to be very

00:21:52.671 --> 00:21:56.520
upright, straight forward in life if you are honest

00:21:56.721 --> 00:21:59.771
if you are all other things then it is enough.

00:22:00.062 --> 00:22:05.423
But another may ask," Why, For What was the purpose of all this?"

00:22:06.403 --> 00:22:07.977
Why should we have this balanced life?

00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:11.463
Why should we go through this rigmarole of

00:22:11.664 --> 00:22:14.040
 being very steady, this, that.

00:22:14.253 --> 00:22:16.538
Any body can ask, young people will ask this question.

00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:20.653
 Why this nonsense of being all these things , for what?

00:22:21.435 --> 00:22:24.008
This balance is for the ascent.

00:22:24.993 --> 00:22:26.580
Without the balance it cannot ascend.

00:22:26.781 --> 00:22:28.284
That is why the balance has to come.

00:22:28.803 --> 00:22:30.703
That is why you have to be in the middle.

00:22:31.290 --> 00:22:35.416
You have to be in moderation because you have to ascend.

00:22:35.647 --> 00:22:39.299
And for the ascent, all the extreme temperament cannot beat.

00:22:39.922 --> 00:22:43.009
Supposing you have an aeroplane which has one wheel missing.

00:22:43.210 --> 00:22:44.134
will it fly?

00:22:44.819 --> 00:22:47.584
Which has got one wheel very heavy it won't fly.

00:22:48.150 --> 00:22:49.978
So, one has to have a balance

00:22:50.479 --> 00:22:55.419
and this balance is achieved through your being in moderation

00:22:55.576 --> 00:22:59.952
or being , I would not say (DHARMIC) because Dharmic means nonsense

00:23:00.274 --> 00:23:02.496
but Dharmic means the Dharma

00:23:02.697 --> 00:23:06.575
the Dharma within you, the ten valencies that are within you.

00:23:07.163 --> 00:23:10.928
which are the valencies of human beings to be balanced.

00:23:11.298 --> 00:23:15.223
We can say the ten commandments or we can say the ten valencies

00:23:15.395 --> 00:23:16.867
or we can say the DASHA DHARMAS ( the ten dharmas).

00:23:17.963 --> 00:23:18.752
They are inner things

00:23:18.953 --> 00:23:21.818
they are not outside, they are inside yourself.

00:23:22.942 --> 00:23:26.009
When they are in balance, the ascent takes place.

00:23:27.772 --> 00:23:29.212
Now the difference between

00:23:30.455 --> 00:23:33.036
all those historical things that we have seen

00:23:33.774 --> 00:23:36.007
all those

00:23:36.245 --> 00:23:38.733
self realisation stories we have heard

00:23:39.149 --> 00:23:40.765
have been of one or two persons

00:23:41.086 --> 00:23:43.036
because of the tree of life at that time

00:23:43.237 --> 00:23:44.284
they were one or two flowers.

00:23:45.158 --> 00:23:48.494
I find there are thousands today. The blossom time has come.

00:23:48.728 --> 00:23:50.644
So, many will get realisation no doubt.

00:23:51.539 --> 00:23:55.091
But the other difference between all those practices where

00:23:55.286 --> 00:23:56.980
people used to cleanse themselves

00:23:57.465 --> 00:23:59.166
chakras by chakras they used to raise it.

00:23:59.261 --> 00:24:00.327
They used to go to real gurus, satgurus.

00:24:00.528 --> 00:24:03.378
 not these horrible gurus but satgurus.

00:24:05.814 --> 00:24:06.914
Satgurus they used to go.

00:24:07.658 --> 00:24:11.163
and these gurus would raise their kundalini one by one step by step

00:24:11.364 --> 00:24:12.852
and give them realisation, cleanse them.

00:24:13.053 --> 00:24:14.625
 It was a very hazardous method.

00:24:15.923 --> 00:24:17.023
So as the Mother

00:24:17.675 --> 00:24:21.360
I thought why not make you your own guru.

00:24:22.455 --> 00:24:23.661
How do you do it?

00:24:24.018 --> 00:24:25.617
Somehow or other, I must develop a method

00:24:26.171 --> 00:24:30.079
by which I can manage amass realisation.

00:24:31.347 --> 00:24:34.128
Let many people get realisation.

00:24:35.299 --> 00:24:38.507
Now the kundalini doesn't rise in its own full force,

00:24:38.569 --> 00:24:40.372
because the chakras are not clean

00:24:40.696 --> 00:24:42.036
there are problems on the chakras,

00:24:42.237 --> 00:24:43.652
there are blockages things like that.

00:24:44.366 --> 00:24:45.933
But there is a wee bit

00:24:46.410 --> 00:24:50.512
a small hair like power can rise in some people

00:24:50.616 --> 00:24:52.683
Some people can have a bigger flow

00:24:52.914 --> 00:24:55.671
some people can have a completete jet coming out.

00:24:56.061 --> 00:25:00.707
But everybody should have this experience.

00:25:01.249 --> 00:25:03.776
And as a result of that, the

00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:09.970
light in of the spirit flickers a little bit.

00:25:10.314 --> 00:25:13.420
In that light you can see your own problems.

00:25:13.923 --> 00:25:15.395
You can see what is wrong with you

00:25:16.636 --> 00:25:18.624
because you can feel it on your finger tips.

00:25:19.616 --> 00:25:22.420
and if you know how to correct them, you become your own guru

00:25:22.621 --> 00:25:24.094
you correct yourself, I don't want to tell you.

00:25:24.650 --> 00:25:26.400
Because if I tell you, you will all run away.

00:25:26.882 --> 00:25:29.091
These are not the days to tell anybody to do something.

00:25:29.290 --> 00:25:30.390
That is the worst thing.

00:25:31.377 --> 00:25:34.015
So only thing is you get your realisation

00:25:34.951 --> 00:25:36.398
get this little light with you

00:25:36.599 --> 00:25:39.107
and see for your self what is wrong with you and you manage it.

00:25:39.274 --> 00:25:40.714
This is the only difference is

00:25:41.149 --> 00:25:42.433
and I find this works better.

00:25:43.145 --> 00:25:45.545
Because human beings in the modern times

00:25:45.746 --> 00:25:48.256
have accumulated so much of ego on their head, so much

00:25:49.376 --> 00:25:50.476
beyond their heads.

00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:52.280
So no use touching it.

00:25:52.879 --> 00:25:55.748
Best is to raise the kundalini, so that they see their ego.

00:25:56.907 --> 00:25:59.641
And they say, "Mother, Please remove this

00:25:59.923 --> 00:26:03.564
thing that has gone on my head, please remove this."

00:26:04.462 --> 00:26:05.562
They themselves say.

00:26:06.353 --> 00:26:09.468
This is what is this modern Sahajyoga is.

00:26:10.191 --> 00:26:13.488
The Kundalini awakening is very simple.

00:26:13.843 --> 00:26:17.908
People might have told you that it gives you problems and all that.

00:26:18.387 --> 00:26:21.208
I just don't know because thousands of people

00:26:21.409 --> 00:26:25.994
 in the villages, in the cities, all over the world I have done this.

00:26:26.137 --> 00:26:27.177
Nobody had any problems.

00:26:27.378 --> 00:26:29.873
On the contrary all their problems are solved.

00:26:30.153 --> 00:26:32.419
This is a wrong idea we have got in our head.

00:26:32.588 --> 00:26:35.901
I don't know from where it has come that you have to suffer

00:26:36.889 --> 00:26:38.677
to get to spirituality.

00:26:38.878 --> 00:26:43.093
I just don't understand like some people in England said to me

00:26:43.527 --> 00:26:44.725
that we have to suffer.

00:26:44.955 --> 00:26:46.055
I said ,"Why?"

00:26:46.308 --> 00:26:48.632
Christ has suffered for you. Hasn't He?

00:26:48.728 --> 00:26:50.644
Are you going to suffer more than Christ?

00:26:50.979 --> 00:26:52.976
Why did He suffer for you if there was something

00:26:53.177 --> 00:26:54.833
 left for you to suffer?

00:26:55.423 --> 00:26:57.185
Actually they make everybody else suffer.

00:26:57.386 --> 00:26:58.532
 They don't suffer much.

00:26:59.024 --> 00:27:00.028
All such people.

00:27:00.229 --> 00:27:02.641
Because if you don't eat anything

00:27:02.758 --> 00:27:04.674
you starve, you make yourself miserable.

00:27:04.976 --> 00:27:07.131
Everybody else will be miserable with that person.

00:27:07.511 --> 00:27:11.207
Supposing you want to hurt ME, the best thing is to fast.

00:27:12.131 --> 00:27:14.706
You see Mother I am fasting then I don't feel like eating Myself.

00:27:14.905 --> 00:27:17.321
If My children are fasting, why should I eat?

00:27:19.002 --> 00:27:21.713
But if I say don't fast, then that is the

00:27:22.067 --> 00:27:23.665
most sinister thing I have told you.

00:27:24.342 --> 00:27:26.804
You can fast as much as you like all your life

00:27:27.005 --> 00:27:28.642
 and make everybody fast, doesn't matter.

00:27:28.853 --> 00:27:30.396
But not in the name of God

00:27:30.804 --> 00:27:33.895
You are maligning God. He is Joy!

00:27:34.540 --> 00:27:37.326
He has made all this world so beautiful

00:27:38.453 --> 00:27:39.476
 for you to come!

00:27:39.677 --> 00:27:42.235
He wants to welcome you to His own kingdom!

00:27:43.098 --> 00:27:44.282
And what He finds?

00:27:44.483 --> 00:27:48.172
The people are beating himself, themselves or beating others

00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:51.506
or fasting or torturing themselves.

00:27:51.707 --> 00:27:56.298
This is the kind of attitude that is not going to please God at all.

00:27:59.676 --> 00:28:02.833
I don't know from where these ideas might have come from people

00:28:03.034 --> 00:28:04.598
 who preach about God.

00:28:04.725 --> 00:28:07.690
Because they must be saying, you starve and give all food to me.

00:28:09.753 --> 00:28:12.200
You become a sanyasi. Give all your money to me.

00:28:12.328 --> 00:28:13.428
Must be this is the reason.

00:28:13.698 --> 00:28:17.027
I cannot find any reason for this kind of nonsense

00:28:17.225 --> 00:28:20.306
that you should fast , you should suffer.

00:28:21.235 --> 00:28:23.135
In Sahaj yoga no body is allowed to do that.

00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:25.937
And if you have to do that, then please don't come to Sahaj yoga.

00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:29.503
You have to know that God

00:28:30.361 --> 00:28:36.215
wants you to be the happiest person, to be the most joyous person

00:28:36.459 --> 00:28:40.439
a person without any problems, without any tension

00:28:41.507 --> 00:28:42.607
without any trouble

00:28:43.941 --> 00:28:47.500
enjoying the beauty and the grace

00:28:48.393 --> 00:28:50.174
with all His bliss upon you.

00:28:52.222 --> 00:28:54.193
But for that first of all

00:28:54.782 --> 00:28:56.380
you have to make your mind

00:28:57.108 --> 00:28:59.025
that you first of all forgive yourself.

00:29:00.525 --> 00:29:01.625
and then forgive others.

00:29:02.897 --> 00:29:04.766
and just sit with an open mind.

00:29:05.283 --> 00:29:07.280
I am sure you will get all your realisation

00:29:07.487 --> 00:29:09.964
and feel this all pervading power of God

00:29:10.226 --> 00:29:12.181
 like vibrations or cool breeze

00:29:12.536 --> 00:29:14.785
which is called as the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost

00:29:14.992 --> 00:29:16.337
on your finger tips.

00:29:17.997 --> 00:29:19.201
Some may not feel

00:29:19.402 --> 00:29:22.366
possibly because of some troubles, some obstructions

00:29:22.486 --> 00:29:24.393
some mental projections. May be!

00:29:25.076 --> 00:29:26.921
But that doesn't mean they will not feel later.

00:29:28.055 --> 00:29:29.151
And they should not go and criticize

00:29:29.352 --> 00:29:32.141
 "Oh! i didn't feel, it is all humbug." This is nonsense.

00:29:33.861 --> 00:29:35.357
This is like dog in the manger.

00:29:36.210 --> 00:29:38.379
You cannot eat and don't allow others to eat.

00:29:41.423 --> 00:29:44.736
If you do not feel it then don't condemn yourself either.

00:29:45.301 --> 00:29:47.551
We can workout, you can come back to the center

00:29:47.752 --> 00:29:48.490
and get your realisation.

00:29:49.338 --> 00:29:51.842
Now the time has come for all of us to be wise

00:29:52.519 --> 00:29:53.810
and not to be stupid anymore.

00:29:54.199 --> 00:29:55.299
You have done enough of stupidity.

00:29:56.433 --> 00:29:58.238
Alright as children they are forgiven.

00:29:58.973 --> 00:30:00.540
But if you are born like that

00:30:01.170 --> 00:30:03.269
I don't know where you will land

00:30:03.613 --> 00:30:05.569
and where this world is going to land ultimately.

00:30:06.783 --> 00:30:11.679
So, all of us have to decide, those who are here, that from today

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:15.725
because the new year has started, let us try to be wise.

00:30:16.586 --> 00:30:19.407
And the wisdom has its own powers

00:30:20.644 --> 00:30:22.766
beauty has its own powers

00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:26.235
and love has its all powers.

00:30:26.688 --> 00:30:29.747
Everything emerges into the ocean of 'Love of God'.

00:30:34.049 --> 00:30:37.158
I had told you that I would talk to you in Hindi also.

00:30:37.594 --> 00:30:40.169
And I talk to you in spoken language used in our daily life only.

00:30:40.422 --> 00:30:44.346
I do not use any such language which you may not understand.

00:30:44.662 --> 00:30:48.999
So,those who are against the Hindi language, they are requested that

00:30:49.230 --> 00:30:51.420
I cannot learn many languages.

00:30:51.621 --> 00:30:53.846
I have learnt as many languages as I could

00:30:54.047 --> 00:30:55.709
and it is your daily spoken language

00:30:55.964 --> 00:30:59.465
I speak in the same language in which you watch cinema.

00:30:59.545 --> 00:31:01.628
Some people told ME, "Mother , please speak in Panjabi."

00:31:01.865 --> 00:31:03.879
Earlier I knew Punjabi language a little,

00:31:04.109 --> 00:31:06.905
but now for the past so much time

00:31:09.158 --> 00:31:12.090
it has not been used, so have forgotten a little.

00:31:12.446 --> 00:31:15.044
But the language must be that of 'Love'.

00:31:16.508 --> 00:31:18.671
Learn the language of 'Love'.

00:31:19.457 --> 00:31:21.961
What have you done after learning so many languages?

00:31:22.991 --> 00:31:25.416
Simply think that after learning so many languages

00:31:25.617 --> 00:31:26.744
 we have given rise to all quarrels.

00:31:27.689 --> 00:31:31.030
After that , after learning Dharma what rivalry did we give rise to?

00:31:32.174 --> 00:31:36.196
If Dharma teaches to quarrel, then that cannot be Dharma.

00:31:36.874 --> 00:31:40.131
Because we are the cells of same one God

00:31:41.238 --> 00:31:43.726
the cells of this one God.

00:31:43.964 --> 00:31:46.611
If your one hand starts quarrelling with another hand

00:31:46.776 --> 00:31:52.482
what shall a mother say,"Son, you are two hands of one single body."

00:31:54.541 --> 00:31:57.465
Now when we see that wherever we pay attention

00:31:57.899 --> 00:31:59.382
quarrel goes on even in the name of religion.

00:31:59.583 --> 00:32:02.795
tomorrow's children will say , "God save from such a religion

00:32:02.819 --> 00:32:04.266
and God save from such Gods also."

00:32:05.773 --> 00:32:08.673
Your children only will say that they don't want such a religion.

00:32:09.143 --> 00:32:13.617
What you are asking for today, will be abused tomorrow and lost

00:32:14.573 --> 00:32:16.823
because its proof must be visible.

00:32:17.327 --> 00:32:18.974
Its result must be visible.

00:32:19.348 --> 00:32:24.488
People must know what was the result and what did we achieve.

00:32:25.115 --> 00:32:28.085
If somebody in the house,

00:32:28.286 --> 00:32:31.055
sows babool, people ask,"why are you sowing Babool?

00:32:31.109 --> 00:32:32.864
says, because thorns will grow out of it.

00:32:33.174 --> 00:32:34.578
Why are you sowing thorns?

00:32:34.789 --> 00:32:36.731
Sowing thorns so that , these prick people.

00:32:37.676 --> 00:32:38.776
Very good condition of yours.

00:32:39.024 --> 00:32:40.124
Why are you thinking like that?

00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:42.998
I want that these should prick everyone so that they curse me only.

00:32:43.932 --> 00:32:44.832
Very good!

00:32:45.221 --> 00:32:49.595
All such foolishness that we are making one after the other

00:32:49.689 --> 00:32:52.893
the time has come to put an end to all such foolishness.

00:32:53.047 --> 00:32:54.438
If you do not put an end to it

00:32:54.639 --> 00:32:57.774
God will put an end to it as well as to you.

00:32:59.730 --> 00:33:04.999
Do not blame God for wrong doings.

00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:09.013
For wrong things, don't say God has said so.

00:33:09.266 --> 00:33:11.545
God has said so. He can never say so.

00:33:12.236 --> 00:33:15.766
We have popularised such wrong assertions

00:33:15.891 --> 00:33:19.022
and in every religion their agents are sitting amongst them.

00:33:19.362 --> 00:33:20.348
In which religion it is not so?

00:33:20.549 --> 00:33:23.998
It is so in Christians, in Muslims, in Sikhs

00:33:24.148 --> 00:33:26.606
no less in Hindus, in thousands.

00:33:28.501 --> 00:33:30.949
 Tell Me, in which religion there are not its agents?

00:33:31.274 --> 00:33:33.389
Everybody is earning money. Everything is means of earning money.

00:33:33.583 --> 00:33:36.106
God doesn't understand a single penny.

00:33:36.138 --> 00:33:39.162
If you tell ME tomorrow to write a cheque for a bank,

00:33:39.363 --> 00:33:40.719
I will say, "You write it, I don't know how to write it."

00:33:41.072 --> 00:33:44.091
I have got worldwide wisdom, but I have no knowledge of banks.

00:33:44.292 --> 00:33:46.295
I cannot understand Bank.

00:33:47.688 --> 00:33:50.196
The God who does not understand money,

00:33:50.397 --> 00:33:52.518
you are eaning money in His name.

00:33:52.751 --> 00:33:55.500
Only means of earning money started.

00:33:56.233 --> 00:33:59.165
Now there will start the trade of committing murder.

00:33:59.788 --> 00:34:03.601
Beyond that there will start the trade of all evil acts.

00:34:04.047 --> 00:34:08.230
You must have heard that in the olden days there were such temples

00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:11.181
where all the evil acts were done in the name of God.

00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:13.829
Cheating started in our country.

00:34:14.291 --> 00:34:17.529
By doing all this, by doing all these evil acts

00:34:17.743 --> 00:34:19.742
not having the blessings of God

00:34:19.943 --> 00:34:21.070
people blame God

00:34:21.271 --> 00:34:24.933
and your children will say there is nothing like God.

00:34:26.033 --> 00:34:28.034
Whatever the number of your views are

00:34:28.235 --> 00:34:31.066
there is communism of the whole world

00:34:31.752 --> 00:34:34.322
one is imperialism

00:34:34.648 --> 00:34:36.488
somebody says that

00:34:36.933 --> 00:34:39.265
there should be independance

00:34:39.466 --> 00:34:41.663
some say there should be social democracy

00:34:41.864 --> 00:34:44.387
by creating varieties of isms.

00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:47.097
Now what did you get finally? This you should think.

00:34:47.749 --> 00:34:51.023
Today you go to America, nobody's life is safe.

00:34:51.224 --> 00:34:52.491
It is not in Delhi only.

00:34:52.737 --> 00:34:54.493
Everybody was telling Me about bangles,

00:34:54.694 --> 00:34:56.289
but on the day of Diwali one has to wear it.

00:34:56.326 --> 00:34:58.124
Take these out or the people will snatch (bangles).

00:35:00.184 --> 00:35:02.806
The position of a man in Delhi is , just like a cat

00:35:03.853 --> 00:35:05.936
and the same is going on at other places too.

00:35:06.563 --> 00:35:10.336
So all these excellencies you have accomplished

00:35:11.074 --> 00:35:13.633
on the basis of which people are bewildered all over the world.

00:35:13.878 --> 00:35:15.499
Wherever you go, there is terror

00:35:15.700 --> 00:35:18.356
No notion is no where successful.

00:35:18.663 --> 00:35:21.038
I have been to Russia as well to China.

00:35:21.236 --> 00:35:24.581
and I have been to America as well. All are of the same metal.

00:35:25.368 --> 00:35:27.309
Everybody is cutting his neck with his hand

00:35:27.510 --> 00:35:29.119
 and cutting his nose as well.

00:35:30.441 --> 00:35:33.468
And we are following them.

00:35:34.610 --> 00:35:36.622
Using their own wisdom, if everybody

00:35:36.823 --> 00:35:38.679
has to go to hell, then it is very easy.

00:35:38.716 --> 00:35:40.250
Let there be vacancy in hell.

00:35:40.451 --> 00:35:41.856
How can there be so much space available suddenly?

00:35:45.349 --> 00:35:46.444
Let there be some arrangement first

00:35:46.461 --> 00:35:48.562
Mother has anxiety even if you have to go to hell.

00:35:48.763 --> 00:35:50.282
Even if they go to hell, let there be arrangement there

00:35:50.483 --> 00:35:51.491
 where the children will sit.

00:35:54.702 --> 00:35:58.062
So, such a wave that we have started

00:35:58.255 --> 00:36:00.211
the reality is far from that.

00:36:00.648 --> 00:36:02.675
Exactly on the other side it is darkness there.

00:36:03.411 --> 00:36:04.411
It is mist

00:36:05.411 --> 00:36:07.343
in which you are getting deep down more and more

00:36:07.651 --> 00:36:12.523
ascending towards God and looking upward towards Him is reality.

00:36:14.508 --> 00:36:16.678
Where from these agents will give you PARMATMA(God).

00:36:16.879 --> 00:36:18.910
These agents are money minting people.

00:36:20.311 --> 00:36:21.288
You only tell,

00:36:21.519 --> 00:36:25.856
 "How much money do you pay to these flowers to become fruits?"

00:36:26.690 --> 00:36:29.050
How much money do you pay to this mother earth

00:36:29.251 --> 00:36:30.243
SASHYA SHYAAMALAAM ( productive and brown coloured motherland)

00:36:30.444 --> 00:36:31.294
which helped you so much?

00:36:31.694 --> 00:36:34.730
You have raised so much hue and cry

00:36:35.239 --> 00:36:37.185
With what great difficulty this mother earth

00:36:37.386 --> 00:36:38.965
 cradled and brought up us

00:36:39.029 --> 00:36:42.008
and we are destroying it like this.

00:36:42.070 --> 00:36:43.310
Have saddened it so much

00:36:43.511 --> 00:36:45.092
and even after doing that even today

00:36:45.293 --> 00:36:46.545
that SASYA SHYAMALAM mother earth

00:36:46.657 --> 00:36:49.660
cradles us even today

00:36:49.964 --> 00:36:52.460
Cares for us, looks after us.

00:36:52.661 --> 00:36:54.747
Even taking that into consideration as well

00:36:55.413 --> 00:36:57.298
We do not understand

00:36:57.661 --> 00:37:00.633
that on which path are we digging ourselves.

00:37:01.087 --> 00:37:02.920
All those who are God's messengers

00:37:03.121 --> 00:37:06.455
just perceive that these five elements

00:37:06.475 --> 00:37:08.098
these are God's messengers

00:37:08.463 --> 00:37:12.086
these are their angles ready to help us.

00:37:12.237 --> 00:37:16.237
It is only we who are ready to cut our neck, what shall God do?

00:37:16.894 --> 00:37:18.580
Within you there is Kundalini as well

00:37:19.070 --> 00:37:23.065
and within you, your mother kundalini is settled there beautifully.

00:37:24.395 --> 00:37:26.533
It is settled perfectly in three and half circles.

00:37:27.256 --> 00:37:28.261
Poor (KUNDALINI) is waiting

00:37:28.462 --> 00:37:30.596
that let the foolish fellows come to the right path.

00:37:33.854 --> 00:37:36.421
Then your chakras are also beautifully made.

00:37:37.559 --> 00:37:41.142
and how beautiful arrangement God has made.

00:37:41.685 --> 00:37:42.877
You haven't got any knowledge as yet,

00:37:43.078 --> 00:37:45.174
your eyes have not even opened as yet.

00:37:45.712 --> 00:37:49.549
When your eyes will open, you will come to know then.

00:37:50.288 --> 00:37:52.022
Then you will understand.

00:37:52.592 --> 00:37:56.075
Oh! in what darkness we had sunk?

00:37:56.297 --> 00:37:58.302
somewhere under the darkness of ego

00:37:58.421 --> 00:38:00.821
Somewhere under the darkness of fright

00:38:01.023 --> 00:38:03.987
in the darkness of greed for some wrong things

00:38:04.047 --> 00:38:07.511
covered with all the six evils, where shall we go?

00:38:08.605 --> 00:38:11.283
All these things are absolutely within you.

00:38:11.973 --> 00:38:14.020
What discussion you will do in this case?

00:38:14.221 --> 00:38:17.201
I see many people stand in front of Me with clubs in their hands.

00:38:18.022 --> 00:38:18.922
I asked them, "Why?"

00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:21.541
They said ,"They were saying that by raising Kundalini it happens,"

00:38:21.742 --> 00:38:23.365
 I said," You better go to them."

00:38:24.493 --> 00:38:26.020
Anyone says anything

00:38:26.402 --> 00:38:27.592
if anyone says anything

00:38:27.793 --> 00:38:30.074
is getting it published in newspaper, how does it matter?

00:38:30.203 --> 00:38:32.929
You take a plain paper and print it out.

00:38:33.547 --> 00:38:36.599
Anyone who prints anything, is that a Shastra?

00:38:36.854 --> 00:38:39.139
Is that about God?

00:38:39.620 --> 00:38:41.496
How much effort did Nanak Sahab made?

00:38:41.869 --> 00:38:43.659
that all those who were realised souls

00:38:44.317 --> 00:38:46.550
all those have been put together in Granth Sahab

00:38:47.342 --> 00:38:50.401
attatched them in Granth Sahab, attatched Namdev to it.

00:38:50.768 --> 00:38:53.475
And the day before yesterday, I thought that in the temple of Namdev

00:38:53.676 --> 00:38:55.185
 somebody had been murdered. Oh! Ram

00:38:56.233 --> 00:38:57.233
That Namdev

00:38:58.232 --> 00:39:01.608
What to talk of Him to you. Only Nanak sahab could understand Him.

00:39:03.371 --> 00:39:04.747
When Namdev

00:39:05.676 --> 00:39:07.554
went to meet Gora kumbhar (a saint and potter by trade)

00:39:08.100 --> 00:39:10.424
he said these words, see what beautiful words he said.

00:39:10.457 --> 00:39:13.460
See his beauty  and our crudeness

00:39:13.780 --> 00:39:14.880
and foolishness.

00:39:15.611 --> 00:39:18.027
Now , Gora kumbhar, was a poor potter

00:39:18.223 --> 00:39:20.560
whom we should call, a schedule caste and this tailor

00:39:22.345 --> 00:39:24.249
just on seeing him, he says

00:39:24.829 --> 00:39:27.263
NIRGUNACHE  BHETI AALO SUGUNASANGE'

00:39:28.008 --> 00:39:28.938
in the guise of Nirguna (without qualities)

00:39:29.139 --> 00:39:30.794
i reached Saguna (refers to God)

00:39:30.995 --> 00:39:32.230
 in the form of Saguna Nirguna was standing.

00:39:32.776 --> 00:39:37.708
This love, this respect and this honour only a yogi can do

00:39:39.649 --> 00:39:42.506
to respect another person is not possible for a man.

00:39:43.232 --> 00:39:44.332
They can't do.

00:39:44.652 --> 00:39:46.758
Because you don't know

00:39:46.988 --> 00:39:51.588
how much the other person is respectable, how much important he is

00:39:51.789 --> 00:39:54.960
how much loving , how much dignified he is .

00:39:55.122 --> 00:39:56.930
Some minister comes to you and you run after him.

00:39:57.066 --> 00:39:59.207
He left yesterday, you ignored him and ran after another one.

00:39:59.457 --> 00:40:04.021
You don't have any discretion whom to follow and whom to run after

00:40:04.974 --> 00:40:06.605
If you have your own dignity

00:40:06.806 --> 00:40:08.909
you can recognise another dignified person.

00:40:09.006 --> 00:40:11.311
That this Sakhshat (In reality) dignified person

00:40:12.495 --> 00:40:13.742
is standing in the form of Saguna.

00:40:14.060 --> 00:40:16.579
But you don't have the eye to recognise that.

00:40:16.924 --> 00:40:19.459
 For that too one should have eye that has light.

00:40:19.948 --> 00:40:22.635
Thousands of people wrote

00:40:22.836 --> 00:40:24.190
many said

00:40:24.989 --> 00:40:27.548
but today we are just forgotten and wandering.

00:40:28.091 --> 00:40:29.745
And what to talk of these Hindus!

00:40:31.125 --> 00:40:34.353
Such tortures have been inflicted on women, from Sitaji till now.

00:40:34.554 --> 00:40:37.597
You are paying for that sin and save God from these Christians.

00:40:38.562 --> 00:40:40.998
If you find a more foolish person than them, let ME know.

00:40:42.788 --> 00:40:44.964
All the frivolous tales about Christ are there.

00:40:45.165 --> 00:40:47.340
Now a days they even say that Christ was a human being.

00:40:47.613 --> 00:40:49.480
Who has told them so?

00:40:50.282 --> 00:40:51.562
One gentleman in England has said

00:40:51.763 --> 00:40:54.547
he is a renowned person, called Bishop of Durham

00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:57.291
that Christ was an ordinary man.

00:40:57.611 --> 00:41:00.791
His birth has been just like us

00:41:00.991 --> 00:41:03.668
some of His disciples were uneducated.

00:41:04.536 --> 00:41:08.888
Just ask them ,"What do you know about Christ?"

00:41:09.610 --> 00:41:12.582
Do you have the insight to know Him?"

00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:16.818
Do you have the ability that you are telling to Christ

00:41:16.982 --> 00:41:18.630
Because somebody has elected you

00:41:18.831 --> 00:41:21.275
somebody appointed you as Bishop and somebody as Pope

00:41:21.476 --> 00:41:22.718
 have you become a great man?

00:41:24.046 --> 00:41:27.256
In this way, you put them on your heads, beat drums and wander.

00:41:28.054 --> 00:41:30.597
I am telling you that all these drum beatings are of hell.

00:41:30.859 --> 00:41:32.075
By following these wrong gurus

00:41:32.276 --> 00:41:34.868
do not take yourself and your children to hell.

00:41:35.069 --> 00:41:37.032
There is unrighteousness in all these religions.

00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:39.966
DHARMA is only of one VISHWA DHARM PARMATMA

00:41:40.167 --> 00:41:42.339
 and that DHARMA is to achieve God.

00:41:42.621 --> 00:41:44.853
Till now, tell Me who did not say so?

00:41:45.004 --> 00:41:46.104
Am I telling it today?

00:41:47.381 --> 00:41:49.329
Were all those liars who said

00:41:49.563 --> 00:41:52.860
KAHE NANAK BINA AAPA CHINE MITEY NA BRAMHA KI KAI

00:41:53.061 --> 00:41:54.783
How many people recognised AAPA?

00:41:55.222 --> 00:41:56.734
Those who had to say said so

00:41:57.617 --> 00:41:59.164
They said thousands of times and left

00:41:59.315 --> 00:42:02.372
They were tortured to death when they were living

00:42:02.476 --> 00:42:04.202
and till now only they are killing.

00:42:05.746 --> 00:42:07.180
I say,"Be aware!"

00:42:08.463 --> 00:42:10.617
To everybody I as a Mother today

00:42:12.193 --> 00:42:13.293
warn you

00:42:14.024 --> 00:42:15.942
there is no need to go forward than this.

00:42:16.749 --> 00:42:20.020
Stand up and get in Sahaj Yoga

00:42:20.938 --> 00:42:24.163
and proudly become saints.

00:42:25.692 --> 00:42:30.383
Avail this NIRGUNA which is today spread all around us

00:42:30.822 --> 00:42:31.965
sitting to respect us

00:42:32.166 --> 00:42:33.700
 sitting to honour us.

00:42:34.148 --> 00:42:35.957
Obtain that.

00:42:36.158 --> 00:42:40.037
Are you going to take these useless things on your head?

00:42:40.675 --> 00:42:42.218
That which you should take

00:42:42.924 --> 00:42:44.530
that which is available to you so easily

00:42:44.780 --> 00:42:46.966
when this diamond is so easily available

00:42:47.117 --> 00:42:49.343
then why not to get that?

00:42:50.053 --> 00:42:52.120
I cannot understand man's wisdom

00:42:52.649 --> 00:42:54.430
My father was tired of making ME understand.

00:42:54.630 --> 00:42:56.121
He would say,"You won't understand all this."

00:42:56.598 --> 00:42:58.657
In reality I am still learning.

00:42:59.343 --> 00:43:02.330
How does a human being looks at things from the reverse side?

00:43:03.055 --> 00:43:05.091
Why he doesn't look at things from the right side?

00:43:05.743 --> 00:43:08.542
And when everyone has already said, specially in our own country

00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:10.699
there are so many great saints.

00:43:11.535 --> 00:43:12.888
Hey! feel ashamed of yourself!

00:43:16.321 --> 00:43:20.801
Today, we have a lot of questions, for example

00:43:22.923 --> 00:43:23.552
In our culture it has been said,

00:43:23.753 --> 00:43:26.476
YATRA NARIYA PUJYANTE TATRA RAMANTE DEVATA

00:43:26.700 --> 00:43:29.926
Where a woman is worth adoring and adored

00:43:30.752 --> 00:43:32.454
there itself Gods reside.

00:43:33.588 --> 00:43:35.241
Here the way women are

00:43:36.321 --> 00:43:37.221
tortured

00:43:37.518 --> 00:43:40.344
 every Indian thinks that he is a male

00:43:40.599 --> 00:43:43.483
he has the right to get rid of woman.

00:43:43.930 --> 00:43:45.941
The person who has given birth to you is your mother

00:43:46.484 --> 00:43:48.382
One who is by your side is your wife

00:43:48.583 --> 00:43:49.404
one who is your daughter,

00:43:49.605 --> 00:43:50.865
they are all women.

00:43:50.956 --> 00:43:52.483
By doing excesses with women

00:43:52.684 --> 00:43:55.655
she becomes lioness and can dispose off you.

00:43:55.917 --> 00:43:57.508
But what is the use of this rivalry?

00:43:57.709 --> 00:43:59.581
This rivalry is of no use.

00:44:00.126 --> 00:44:03.741
This rivalry is there because you don't know

00:44:04.459 --> 00:44:06.452
You are the two wheels of one chariot

00:44:06.653 --> 00:44:08.545
one in the left , the other in the right.

00:44:08.644 --> 00:44:12.748
Both are of same height but not alike

00:44:14.995 --> 00:44:17.875
In Sahaj Yoga last time

00:44:19.923 --> 00:44:25.388
according to our desire and joyfully we had fifty one marriages.

00:44:25.674 --> 00:44:27.240
But out of fifty one marriages

00:44:28.678 --> 00:44:31.931
not even one marriage failed. All the marriages are going on nicely.

00:44:32.904 --> 00:44:34.927
It gives a great joy to see them.

00:44:35.128 --> 00:44:39.922
Clapping

00:44:39.988 --> 00:44:43.632
Apart from this diseases get cured just by the way.

00:44:44.204 --> 00:44:47.092
Just now you saw one gentleman who came up to the stage

00:44:47.386 --> 00:44:49.890
He had blood cancer, he got well absolutely.

00:44:50.620 --> 00:44:53.874
Your diseases, come atleast with this greed, I am your Mother.

00:44:54.133 --> 00:44:55.846
that first

00:44:56.047 --> 00:44:57.503
even if castroil has to be given

00:44:57.704 --> 00:44:59.515
she gives it by covering it with chocolate.

00:45:00.003 --> 00:45:01.796
Ok! come to get cured.

00:45:02.047 --> 00:45:04.717
No, we are healthy. We are very strong.

00:45:05.404 --> 00:45:08.840
Ok for your peace! We live in absolute peace.

00:45:10.047 --> 00:45:11.047
Very peaceful! We are very peaceful!

00:45:11.095 --> 00:45:14.310
We are in peace, we slap wife twice or thrice and nothing else.

00:45:14.357 --> 00:45:14.992
Clapping

00:45:15.193 --> 00:45:17.833
We take out all our anger on wife . We are sitting peacefully.

00:45:17.890 --> 00:45:19.716
You are very peaceful! What to speak of you!

00:45:22.612 --> 00:45:25.208
We have got enough. We don't need anything.

00:45:26.607 --> 00:45:27.943
Then I can't say anything

00:45:28.144 --> 00:45:30.957
But you will come, by and by you also come.

00:45:31.693 --> 00:45:33.358
But My son, why not to get it now?

00:45:34.527 --> 00:45:35.527
Now, I have come!

00:45:36.221 --> 00:45:38.655
Dr. Sahab said,"Mother please come to Delhi for one day.

00:45:38.805 --> 00:45:39.805
"I said ,"ok! I will come."

00:45:40.397 --> 00:45:42.274
I have come. Here is a center.

00:45:42.739 --> 00:45:44.222
Three four doctors are carrying on research work.

00:45:44.423 --> 00:45:46.483
They have found out that by joining Sahaj Yoga

00:45:46.684 --> 00:45:48.449
 a human being instantly becomes

00:45:49.085 --> 00:45:52.697
Which in Punjabi language is called ' very good '

00:45:55.366 --> 00:45:57.697
when he took their readings.

00:45:57.898 --> 00:46:00.697
Now he is writing a paper, that he noted in that reading

00:46:01.086 --> 00:46:03.820
that man's [INAUDIBLE] resistance power increased

00:46:04.443 --> 00:46:05.952
his stress level decreased

00:46:06.754 --> 00:46:09.667
which you call ' tension'. ' Now a days i have got tension '

00:46:09.868 --> 00:46:10.570
  That was over.

00:46:10.626 --> 00:46:13.768
When this hole occurs in Bramharandra, then there is no tension.

00:46:14.589 --> 00:46:16.815
And in this way he found out lot of things

00:46:17.111 --> 00:46:18.998
And we are carrying on research work over cancer as well

00:46:19.148 --> 00:46:20.945
Research means, as such everything is research only

00:46:21.018 --> 00:46:25.458
but he had said that you collect all the reports of this

00:46:25.543 --> 00:46:26.334
and make its documents.

00:46:26.535 --> 00:46:27.843
That we are doing.

00:46:28.803 --> 00:46:31.715
But even after doing this, please do not get here only sick people.

00:46:31.855 --> 00:46:35.125
kindly, everyone here must not be sick.

00:46:35.308 --> 00:46:37.194
Some must be such who are healthy.

00:46:37.417 --> 00:46:38.655
Bring such people also.

00:46:39.372 --> 00:46:42.293
Because we want such people also who can cure other people.

00:46:42.873 --> 00:46:45.107
Now, I have only two hands.

00:46:46.106 --> 00:46:48.464
And with these two hands whatever I can do, I do.

00:46:49.565 --> 00:46:52.748
I request you that in this great movement

00:46:53.618 --> 00:46:57.726
It is for the betterment of the whole world.

00:46:58.468 --> 00:47:01.321
Must come! We don't need any money for this.

00:47:02.260 --> 00:47:04.932
I don't need any respect. I don't need anything.

00:47:05.845 --> 00:47:09.039
Even if you don't give anything to Mother, She will still love you.

00:47:09.198 --> 00:47:10.198
This you know very well.

00:47:10.952 --> 00:47:12.363
So, I don't want anything from you.

00:47:12.681 --> 00:47:15.669
I only want that you take what is yours.

00:47:17.271 --> 00:47:19.564
Whtever is hidden within you

00:47:20.213 --> 00:47:23.314
that which is subtle, get it. It is your right.

00:47:23.515 --> 00:47:25.124
That you should get.

00:47:25.681 --> 00:47:30.372
May God give you all wisdom and blessings.
