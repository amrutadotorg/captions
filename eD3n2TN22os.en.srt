1
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,610
I bow to all the seekers of truth!

2
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:31,280
At the very outset we have to know that truth
is what it is.

3
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,220
We cannot conceptualize it.

4
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:37,380
We cannot organize it.

5
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:46,470
Also, we cannot know it at the stage we are,
that is, the human awareness.

6
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:59,550
We have to become something subtler, something
higher, to know the truth.

7
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:04,760
And to know the truth you cannot pay for it.

8
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,970
It exists.

9
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:23,340
Only our evolutionary process has brought
us to the human level and we have to know,

10
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:28,540
that yet we have not known the Absolute truth.

11
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:35,500
If you had known Absolute truth, there would
have been no problems, no arguments, no fighting,

12
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,040
no wars.

13
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,930
We did not know that.

14
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:48,800
And we would not know it because we have to
reach the point where we can know Absolute.

15
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:56,890
So there’s a little breakthrough more needed
so that we can know the truth.

16
00:06:56,890 --> 00:07:07,790
When we talk of know and knowledge, we have
to understand that it’s not the mental understanding

17
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:09,630
that is knowledge.

18
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:20,100
For example, one of the disciples of Christ,
Thomas, travelled down to India and he wrote

19
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:29,600
lots of treatise in Egypt and put them in
a big jar which was discovered about 48 years

20
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,650
back.

21
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:40,480
Then they tried to decode it and a book has
already come out of it called as ‘Gnostics’.

22
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,810
He says, those who know, are ‘Gnostics.’

23
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:49,950
Now imagine the ‘Gn’ words comes from
Sanskrit meaning, to know on your central

24
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:59,760
nervous system, not mental, but on your central
nervous system whatever we know is the knowledge.

25
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:04,710
And those who know on their central nervous
system are the ‘Gnostics.’

26
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:08,040
It’s a wonderful thing they have done.

27
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:14,540
But still, they are busy with the rest of
the book and they said that truth is an experience

28
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:16,560
of the truth.

29
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,090
So let us see what is the truth.

30
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:29,130
Whatever I tell you today you need not accept
it blind folded but you must keep your mind

31
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:36,440
open like a scientist.

32
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:46,620
Whatever I say is like a hypothesis for you
and if you find it works out, then you have

33
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:49,050
to accept it.

34
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:53,100
As honest people, you have to accept.

35
00:08:53,100 --> 00:09:01,620
Now I say that the truth is that you are the
Spirit.

36
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:12,870
You are not this body, mind, but you are the
Spirit and the second truth is that there

37
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:25,670
is an all pervading power of God’s love
which does all the living work.

38
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:27,730
We take everything for granted.

39
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:37,480
For example, if we have a seed with us, we
plant it in the Mother Earth and it sprouts

40
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,480
by itself.

41
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,950
It’s a living process.

42
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:45,120
We take that living process absolutely for
granted.

43
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:51,040
We don’t want to know how it works out.

44
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,940
It’s spontaneous.

45
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:55,160
Spontaneous means Sahaj.

46
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,840
Sahaj means born with you.

47
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,750
It is born with you.

48
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:09,290
The yoga is the union with this all pervading
divine power.

49
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:16,190
This state is to be achieved by all of you.

50
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:25,840
Is your fundamental right, your birth right
to achieve it because if you do not achieve

51
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:35,380
it, you will not know the meaning of your
life, the beauty of your being and the greatness

52
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:39,050
of your existence.

53
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:46,580
Like this instrument has got these wires and
if I do not put them to the mains they do

54
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:47,580
not work.

55
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,480
They have no meaning.

56
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:56,330
In the same way we are to be connected to
the mains.

57
00:10:56,330 --> 00:11:03,180
Now about Kundalini he has already told you
about this beautiful thing that is within

58
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,860
us.

59
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:13,150
When we talk about it, you should also not
take it for granted but you can see the results

60
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:17,870
that you can achieve by this kundalini awakening.

61
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:26,320
Of course it’s a living process and as you
do not pay any money for sprouting a seed,

62
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:31,370
in the same way you cannot pay money because
God doesn’t understand money.

63
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:33,960
He doesn’t understand banking!

64
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,900
He doesn’t understand.

65
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:41,370
But somehow or the other we feel that we can
purchase God.

66
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:44,410
We can pay for Him.

67
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:50,300
Anybody who is available for money cannot
be your master.

68
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:56,670
He cannot be a person who will deliver the
goods which are divine.

69
00:11:56,670 --> 00:12:04,230
So to achieve anything divine you have to
know one thing that, it is a spontaneous thing.

70
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:10,620
It is the last breakthrough of your evolutionary
process and as you have not paid anything

71
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:17,000
to become a human being, you don’t have
to pay anything to become a higher personality.

72
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:34,100
But, it’s rather surprising how we try to
think in the terms of some mundane method

73
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:38,950
of achieving this higher state of awareness.

74
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:49,200
It’s a living process, very simple and just
works spontaneously and the power of kundalini

75
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,820
which is shown here is your individual Mother.

76
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:58,520
She is the power of pure desire.

77
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:08,350
As you know, in economics it is said that
in general ‘wants are not satiable.’

78
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:16,240
That means the desires, jump from one to another
but this is the pure desire which you may

79
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:23,570
be aware, not aware of it but which acts and
is working within you.

80
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:26,270
That’s why you’re seeking the truth.

81
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:29,400
That’s why you want to know what is beyond?

82
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,280
After all why I’m here?

83
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:39,010
Everybody has this question sometime in life…why
am I on this Earth? and what am I doing here?

84
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:46,810
Now the answer is only in your achieving the
state of the Spirit.

85
00:13:46,810 --> 00:14:00,050
The state of the Spirit is a state in which
you become a new personality with a new dimension

86
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:03,430
of your awareness which Jung has described.

87
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:10,210
Jung has clearly described that once when
you get your self realization you become collectively

88
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:11,210
conscious.

89
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:12,480
So its a question of becoming.

90
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:20,540
It’s not just certifying that you are twice
born, that you are a realized soul, that you

91
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:24,940
are something of a higher awareness.

92
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:31,460
It is the state in which you jump.

93
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:39,190
The state which you know of and you should
also know the modus operandi of the whole

94
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:40,190
thing.

95
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:46,700
So the yoga has two meanings; one means the
‘union’ and another meaning the ‘yukti’

96
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:50,410
means the modus operandi.

97
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:51,520
You must know how it works.

98
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:56,020
If somebody says, alright I’ll give you
a name, I mean there have been so many from

99
00:14:56,020 --> 00:15:04,970
my country unfortunately, who have been selling
mantras, marketing God, marketing Ayurveda,

100
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:11,130
marketing this, marketing that and people
take it for granted.

101
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:12,820
They don’t know anything about it.

102
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:18,210
For example TM, I was told, is so strong here,
I better not tell you how far it has gone

103
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:20,170
to destroy people.

104
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:28,130
But they charge, to begin with, 300 pounds
for giving mantras and they’re told you

105
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:30,650
should not talk about it to anyone.

106
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:36,890
Now these mantras were 3 types – one was
called as ‘inga, pinga, thinga’.

107
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:41,790
These 3 words are not even Sanskrit and the
person who is supposed to be a ‘Maharishi’

108
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:45,350
doesn’t even know a word of Sanskrit language!

109
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:51,320
‘Inga’ means the scorpion bite, pinga
means when a person gets possessed and goes

110
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:54,110
round and round, that’s ‘pinga’ and
‘thinga’ means showing like this [Shri

111
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:55,110
Mataji shows Her thumb].

112
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:58,490
So it was said you’re not to tell this to
anyone.

113
00:15:58,490 --> 00:15:59,490
It’s a secret.

114
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:00,740
It’s a sacred secret!

115
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:10,350
Imagine the nonsense of it and people paid
300 pounds for this so called mantra and then

116
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:15,140
6000 pounds they paid, you’ll be amazed,
for becoming a ‘siddha.’

117
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:19,640
Now, what is a ‘siddha’ is that they start
flying in the air!

118
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,640
It’s nonsense!

119
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:24,580
Why do you want to fly in the air about 4
feet above [you see]?

120
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:28,560
Already we are having problems of the traffic.

121
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,080
It’s absurd!

122
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,050
How can you accept such suggestions?

123
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:35,210
You’re all very intelligent people.

124
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:39,060
And they said, that alright, we will give
you a siddha mantra.

125
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:44,830
So they made them sit on the foam and made
them jump and then when they started jumping

126
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:48,750
they broke their bottoms and there have been
cases and cases after them.

127
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:56,450
6000 pounds they charge for this kind of a
nonsense and then they said that we’ll pay

128
00:16:56,450 --> 00:17:01,710
you, I mean you’ll have to become a very
special personality.

129
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:05,710
So first they gave them the water which boils
some potatoes.

130
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:07,510
It’s a fact!

131
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:10,540
I’m telling the truth and I am not afraid
of them.

132
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:17,520
And then they said, alright you take this
water for 6 days, 6000 pounds, imagine!

133
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:26,460
And the 7th day, you take, what you call,
the rind of the potatoes and the 8th day the

134
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:27,820
potatoes.

135
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:28,820
For what?

136
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:32,100
For going in the air just like walking up!

137
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,100
What to say?

138
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:37,870
I don’t know, it’s never described in
any one of the books.

139
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:44,790
No where such a nonsense is described and
people paid.

140
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:50,140
And the gentleman who was in charge of this
flying academy, became bankrupt!

141
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:57,230
His wife, he, his daughter got epilepsy and
then they came to Sahaja Yoga.

142
00:17:57,230 --> 00:18:00,420
He is writing a book about it.

143
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:05,440
I hope it comes out very soon and you will
know what these TM people are like.

144
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,250
They are marketing everything!

145
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:12,270
Now they are marketing Ayurveda.

146
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:16,390
What is the need for these people to market
Ayurveda?

147
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:23,710
You cannot have Ayurveda in the western countries
because its freshly prepared things.

148
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:26,270
Only in India you can do it.

149
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:33,810
But you can market anything to these simple
people, who have no idea as to what it is.

150
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:43,420
It’s a such a shameful thing for me as an
Indian that such people should come out of

151
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:47,370
my country but now I am told Americans have
taken over.

152
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:52,890
Even some Australians have taken over, the
same tricks and they are minting money out

153
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:56,520
of you.

154
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:02,290
We had one gentleman who bought Rolls Royces
after Rolls Royces and then they were sold

155
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:04,750
out, auctioned, you know him very well.

156
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:07,550
What is the interest of a saint in a Rolls
Royce?

157
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:08,660
I can’t understand.

158
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:16,550
For example when I was in Boston they asked
me, Americans special type of brains they

159
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:20,670
have, so they said, Mother, ‘how many Rolls
Royces you have?

160
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:22,200
I said, ‘I have none.’

161
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,750
‘Don’t have any Rolls Royces?’

162
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:26,320
‘No, no I have my husband’s cars, that’s
all!’

163
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,140
He said, ‘then we are not interested, it’s
no business.’

164
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:32,460
I said ‘no, it’s no business at all , it’s
not a business!

165
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:33,880
‘Then we are not interested.’

166
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:37,010
They wouldn’t even take me on the television
for that.

167
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:38,300
Can you imagine!

168
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,460
This is American brain.

169
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:46,990
And that’s how they all landed in America
and they marketed everything.

170
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:52,500
This is to be understood that divinity is
a pure thing.

171
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,040
It purifies you.

172
00:19:54,040 --> 00:20:02,680
It has nothing to do with this materialistic
attitude of these so called saints.

173
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:06,330
Saints cannot be materialistic.

174
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:09,980
If they are materialistic, they are not divine.

175
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:15,870
I have come here to tell you, that all these
things are within yourself.

176
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:21,040
This is your own power of kundalini.

177
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:24,220
She is your individual Mother.

178
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:31,600
She knows each and everything about you and
She’s anxious to give you realization.

179
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:44,010
And this all pervading power of God’s love,
which is described in every scripture, has

180
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:52,230
come into a new mood because it was said that
there’re ‘kaliyuga,’ these horrible

181
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:57,990
modern times, where all kinds of nonsensical
things will take place.

182
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:08,170
And from changing it from this to ‘Satayuga,’
means the Kingdom of God, in between, in this

183
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:14,320
interval, this all pervading power has gone
into another mood called as ‘kritayuga’

184
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,420
where it is active.

185
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:21,200
It is so very active that once you come to
Sahaja Yoga you’ll be surprised and you’ll

186
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,680
say, Mother, ‘what miracles!

187
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:25,030
This miracle, that miracle.’

188
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:29,940
See Its God, Its GOD Almighty!

189
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:34,690
For Him what is a miracle?

190
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:36,550
We think of God, He’s Almighty!

191
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:39,120
But we don’t know what it means.

192
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:47,260
Our faith in God is so limited that we don’t
understand that He is God.

193
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:51,350
My grandmother used to tell me a very sweet
story.

194
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:55,700
Like the grandmother story it was…that a
man was going to see God.

195
00:21:55,700 --> 00:22:03,470
So one gentleman met him on the way, and asked
him, asked him, ‘if you’re going to God,

196
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:08,500
then will you please tell Him that I’ve
been working very hard and when He’s going

197
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,660
to meet me’
He said, ‘alright’

198
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:15,460
Then he met one gentleman on the street, just
like on the side of the street.

199
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:17,070
He said, ‘you’re going to God.

200
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:21,000
Tell Him that I’ve had no food, I’ve had
no food at all’

201
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,180
He said, ‘alright’
He was quite amazed.

202
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:28,070
Look at this man just informing God that he
had no food.

203
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:33,900
So he went to God and saw Him and God said
‘now, you’ve some more work?’

204
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:39,040
He said, ‘no no, you see I met one gentleman
who was saying that he’s working very hard

205
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:44,180
for You and when are You going to meet him
and he was making enquiries.

206
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:49,380
He said that I’m waiting for Him.

207
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:50,970
So You please tell me when will You meet him?’

208
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:56,440
So God just smiled and said, ‘tell him to
wait for sometime, he has to wait.’

209
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:02,260
Then the second one, when he told about the
second one, he said, ‘oh God that fellow

210
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:05,830
was so funny, he just said that You have to
send my food.’

211
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:08,930
‘Yes yes, of course his food has to be arranged
immediately.

212
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:11,180
You have to do something about it.’

213
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:15,490
He couldn’t understand that how these two
reactions are there.

214
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:19,270
God realized that there’s something confusing
him.

215
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:25,660
He told him, ‘see now you are confused.

216
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:29,490
So you go down and tell one thing to both
of them and see their reactions.

217
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:39,770
So just tell them that I went to God and there
I saw that He made a little camel pass through

218
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:43,600
the nose of a needle.’

219
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:48,480
He said, ‘really?’

220
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,600
‘Yes, you just tell them.’

221
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,010
He went down.

222
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:56,610
The first man met him and he said, ‘what
did God, what did He say?’

223
00:23:56,610 --> 00:23:58,840
‘He said that you just have to wait for
a little while.

224
00:23:58,840 --> 00:23:59,840
I’ll come along but you have to wait.’

225
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,600
‘So I have to still wait?’

226
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:06,810
‘Yes Yes’
He said, ‘but what did you see there?’

227
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:17,710
He said, ‘I saw that God, I saw a very big
miracle that He made a big elephant pass through

228
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:19,710
the nose of a needle.’

229
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:21,340
‘It’s not possible.

230
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:22,340
How can it be?

231
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:24,330
Why are you telling me stories?

232
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:27,450
Because you have been to God, you’re telling
me stories?’

233
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:33,770
So he went to another man and he said, ‘yes,
yes of course I knew God would give me food

234
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:36,860
but I wanted to give some message so I told
you, but I’ve got it, everything.

235
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:39,350
And what did you see there?

236
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:49,550
So he said that, ‘that I saw that God made
a camel pass through the nose of a needle.

237
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:51,420
Its a miracle!’

238
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:54,670
He said, ‘what a miracle it is!

239
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:56,090
It’s God.

240
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:58,230
It’s God Almighty!

241
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:00,520
What is it, a little camel?

242
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:04,160
He can make the universes after universes
pass through that.

243
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,710
He’s God Almighty!

244
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:12,630
So you must understand that God has created
us and that we have reached the state.

245
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:20,910
Now we have to just travel about 3 to 4 feet
and we are in the kingdom of God.

246
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:23,810
The time has come for you to achieve it.

247
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:26,780
But it sounds very fantastic to everyone.

248
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:29,980
How can it be, how can it be so easy?

249
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:34,580
I have to say that whatever is important and
vital has to be easy.

250
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:35,740
For example, our breathing.

251
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:43,810
For our breathing, if we had to do some exercises,
if you have to read something then, it would

252
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:47,740
be very difficult.

253
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:55,080
So we have not understood, so far, that we
are still at a stage that to know God we have

254
00:25:55,080 --> 00:26:02,460
to, little bit, know more and that knowing
more is what we call is self realization.

255
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:04,290
You can call it by any name.

256
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:14,830
In any religion, even in ‘Quran,’ is written
that you have to be a ‘Wali’, like we

257
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:19,220
had some in India, Nizamuddin Sahb, this Chisti,
all of them.

258
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:24,300
But Mohammed Sahb has clearly said that at
the time of ‘Kiyamah,’ means at the time

259
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:26,670
of your resurrections, your hands will speak.

260
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:32,740
Now we should not judge Mohammed Sahb by the
way what Saddam is doing.

261
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:34,320
He is a devil.

262
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,100
You can see it clearly.

263
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:41,790
So these people take the name of God, as if
He’s in their pockets and start doing things.

264
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:47,780
And we start doubting how can it be God’s
work?

265
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:51,410
God’s work is absolutely beautiful, pure.

266
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:52,600
He’s compassion.

267
00:26:52,600 --> 00:27:02,170
He is ocean of love and to know Him, first
of all we have to enter into His kingdom.

268
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:07,050
For example, now I landed here and I came
to know about your customs.

269
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:12,090
If I was in India, I would not have known
anything about it.

270
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:18,160
In the same way, if you have not entered into
the kingdom of God, how will you know?

271
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:21,040
It has nothing to do with what age you are.

272
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:24,700
It has nothing to do with what ideas you have.

273
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:28,610
First of all, only thing, you have to be humble
about it.

274
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:31,470
That so far, you have not known the Absolute.

275
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:37,720
But once you know the Absolute you become
a part and parcel of the Whole.

276
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:41,400
The microcosm becomes the macrocosm.

277
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,400
You become.

278
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,450
Again I say you become.

279
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:48,040
Its not question of giving a false certificate
or assuming that yourself.

280
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,510
For example, Steven now is before you.

281
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:54,880
He had problems, physical problems also he
had.

282
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,160
All problems solved.

283
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,540
That’s not so important.

284
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:58,540
But he’s so powerful.

285
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:04,420
He has given realization to so many people,
but he doesn’t say that, he doesn’t behave

286
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:10,160
like other funny people do, like you shave
your head off, or you wear some funny dress

287
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:17,100
or you go about jumping and behaving in a
manner so ridiculous!

288
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:20,770
There’s no need to do these things outside.

289
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:22,070
It’s within yourself.

290
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:26,010
It’s within yourself and it is your own
power.

291
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:27,320
Its your own.

292
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,320
So why not have it?

293
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,490
And its freely available.

294
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:38,100
Why not get to that which is your own, your
own property.

295
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:46,110
Today they asked me to give a more sort of
a introductory lecture about Sahaja Yoga.

296
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:53,790
It’s such a deep ocean of knowledge that,
I don’t know, I must have given at least

297
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:59,480
4000 or 5000 lectures in English language
itself and so many other languages but still

298
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,530
the knowledge, they say, ‘Mother, you never
repeat.’

299
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:05,520
I’m quite surprised that the thing, that
I never repeat anything.

300
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:09,780
But the ocean is so great, and the more you
swim in it, the more you enjoy.

301
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:17,240
Now I would only request you, to have an open
mind about it, very open mind.

302
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:23,660
You must know the problems of this world are
not because of God, they are because of human

303
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:24,660
beings.

304
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:25,720
Any problem.

305
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:33,350
Take ecological problem now; the way we have
gone head long into exploiting our Mother

306
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:34,350
Earth.

307
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:38,010
Any problem you take is because of human beings.

308
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:46,860
So it is important to see why, we human beings
are creating problems for ourselves?

309
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:58,830
And if you locate the source, it is only one
thing that we have to be transformed.

310
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:06,910
The transformation of human beings is needed
and if that transformation is accepted and

311
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:13,640
is worked out, if you become that beautiful
personality, then you will know what you are,

312
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:22,030
how great you are, what is your potential
and what you can do.

313
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:29,700
I hope today, most of you will get your realization,
I hope so and also I would like you to ask

314
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:33,850
me some questions but not aggressive questions.

315
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:38,740
Ask questions which are relevant because I’m
not here to take anything from you.

316
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:42,640
I’m here to just give you what is yours.

317
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:48,210
So ask relevant questions and if you belong
to some group, or to some guru or something,

318
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:53,780
I have to just say, that if you’re satisfied
with them then you can go all out with them.

319
00:30:53,780 --> 00:31:02,080
But if you’re not, then I have to tell you,
that the only way, is to get to self realization.

320
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:20,940
There is no other way out.

321
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:33,530
May God bless you!

322
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:39,280
Question and Answers:

323
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:48,610
Question: To reach the level of spiritual
goal are material goals acceptable?

324
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:55,720
If you want to do some material things, is
that acceptable?

325
00:31:55,720 --> 00:32:03,530
Shri Mataji: After all what is matter?

326
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:06,300
Is also created by God!

327
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:10,490
We can’t create anything.

328
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:20,260
So, when you’re spiritually awakened you
become really extremely compassionate as well

329
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:22,910
as dynamic.

330
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:24,860
The energy is all the time flowing through.

331
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:31,350
Now, can you believe, I am 68 years of age
and I hardly stay in a place for more than

332
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:32,350
3 days.

333
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:38,470
Traveling all over the world.

334
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:39,470
I never get tired.

335
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:45,490
Anything that is material as you see, for
example you want to buy something, for example.

336
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:49,670
Take it, a very mundane things you see, you
want to buy.

337
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:59,470
Now you want to buy something in a shop, if
it is necessary, you go in a shop and you

338
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:02,170
want to know the price and everything.

339
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:07,140
Now how will you know whether this is good
or bad?

340
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:12,140
There’s no way to find out.

341
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:17,900
But when you get self realization you start
getting these cool breeze as vibrations and

342
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:24,820
your fingers become activated, finger tips
and on that you know all these centers as

343
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:26,190
shown here.

344
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:35,950
Now supposing you meet a cheat and he’s
very well dressed and you think he’s a very

345
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:37,560
polished gentleman.

346
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:42,420
But as soon as you put your hands towards
the person, immediately, you’ll find, fingers

347
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:46,630
will be burning.

348
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:50,580
Even in material things, you will feel the
vibrations.

349
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:54,100
You will know what is good and what is bad.

350
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:59,710
Like, many people take so many medicines blind
folded.

351
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:06,690
After all, he must have told you, that in
Sahaja Yoga your health improves.

352
00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:10,770
You get in totality the benevolence.

353
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:17,890
Like we have two doctors in Delhi, who already
have got MD in Sahaja Yoga and there are 400

354
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:23,420
doctors in Russia who are practicing Sahaja
Yoga because you see, they’re very open

355
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:25,010
minded people, like clean slates.

356
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:28,730
They have no conditionings of religion or
anything on their heads.

357
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:30,930
Very open minded people.

358
00:34:30,930 --> 00:34:34,090
So, your health improves.

359
00:34:34,090 --> 00:34:42,630
When your health improves, your mind improves,
your intellect improves, in every way you

360
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:43,980
become so relaxed.

361
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:53,420
Then you see any problem, whether material
or physical, mental, emotional, any problem,

362
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:55,400
as if you are out of that problem.

363
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,350
You see that problem.

364
00:34:57,350 --> 00:35:00,910
And when you see that problem you can solve
it better.

365
00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:04,110
On any level whats so ever.

366
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:06,140
Its not at all complicated.

367
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:10,300
Because we are complicated, we cannot solve
the problems.

368
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:16,790
I would suggest like this, if you’re standing
in the water, you’re afraid of the waves

369
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:20,530
but supposing you are in a boat, you can enjoy
those waves.

370
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:30,590
But supposing if you become a master of swimming
you can jump and you can save so many people.

371
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:36,210
These are the stages which you pass in Sahaja
Yoga and any subject, now we have people who,

372
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:40,530
say, are running factories.

373
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:45,410
Their factories were shut, they had strikes,
they had this problem, that problem.

374
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:46,950
They are perfectly alright.

375
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:53,400
They’re doing so well because the understanding
of totality comes to them.

376
00:35:53,400 --> 00:36:02,420
From small to big, from left to right, everything
you start knowing on your central nervous

377
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:03,420
system.

378
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:07,210
That’s how you solve the problem.

379
00:36:07,210 --> 00:36:09,790
Alright.

380
00:36:09,790 --> 00:36:14,520
For example, now in London, you must have
heard there’s so much of joblessness but

381
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,170
not a single Sahaj Yogi.

382
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:23,630
Once they come to Sahaja Yoga they have jobs
because they become so dynamic, they become

383
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:37,600
so peaceful and faces start shining with that
joy and to find out one jobless person, who

384
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:47,820
is a Sahaj Yogi in England, is a difficult
task.

385
00:36:47,820 --> 00:37:08,190
Question: What is happening in the hands?

386
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:09,960
There’s a tingling.

387
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:46,420
Shri Mataji: Ah, that means something, there’s
a problem, alright, there should be no tingling

388
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:50,200
but if there’s a problem, we’ll correct
it.

389
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,830
There’s tingling, there’s a problem.

390
00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:54,930
You should be corrected.

391
00:37:54,930 --> 00:38:01,690
Actually you should feel the cool breeze in
the hand, but sometimes you feel hot.

392
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:05,240
That is, may be, due to liver also.

393
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,760
You might feel hot but then it cools down.

394
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:13,090
Ultimately you get the cool breeze.

395
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:19,150
This kundalini moves, it passes through all
these centers, about this I’ll tell you

396
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:21,440
tomorrow also, and nourishes all of them.

397
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:34,690
By their nourishment you see it soothes you,
purifies those centers and you feel completely

398
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:35,850
integrated.

399
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:38,180
Completely relaxed.

400
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:40,450
This is the real baptism.

401
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:45,330
It’s not artificial because it breaks through,
this fontanelle bone area and you start feeling

402
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:47,880
the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost coming out
of your head.

403
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,150
It is an actualization.

404
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:50,960
It is not just talking.

405
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,600
It has to work out.

406
00:38:53,600 --> 00:39:13,270
Question: What shape and form does the subtle
body take?

407
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:31,050
Shri Mataji: You see, the Spirit, is a reflection
of God Almighty on our heart.

408
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:36,020
It’s an energy.

409
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:43,500
So the subtle body, if you mean the Spirit,
it is, the light.

410
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:53,500
Is in the form of light and this light, which
I will describe tomorrow, in full, how it

411
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:58,130
acts.

412
00:39:58,130 --> 00:40:12,360
Question: How long it takes for self realization?

413
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,860
Shri Mataji: Oh, it takes no time at all.

414
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:17,280
It takes no time.

415
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:22,020
There was a very great saint, called Ramadasa,
and somebody asked him, ‘How much time does

416
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:24,210
it take for a Kundalini awakening?’

417
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:26,930
He said, ‘Takshan’ ,’that moment!’

418
00:40:26,930 --> 00:40:33,410
But there should be a person deserving to
get it and the one who can give it.

419
00:40:33,410 --> 00:40:40,890
But today I must tell you, I’ve reached
a stage, I cannot explain how, thousands of

420
00:40:40,890 --> 00:40:42,960
them are getting realization.

421
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,040
I went to Russia.

422
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,210
They’ve never known me at all, nothing.

423
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:48,440
First time I went there.

424
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:53,000
They just saw my photograph and in thousands
they came.

425
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:57,430
We had to book a stadium ultimately.

426
00:40:57,430 --> 00:41:02,580
Sixteen thousand, fourteen thousand and all
of them got realization.

427
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:05,030
It has become like a religion with them.

428
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:10,490
I mean how Sahaja Yoga has prospered in Russia,
is something, you cannot explain.

429
00:41:10,490 --> 00:41:12,320
You cannot explain.

430
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:16,830
See, it hardly takes anytime.

431
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:21,040
This is a jet age and the Kundalini also works
like a jet.

432
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,980
You don’t even feel the rising.

433
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:26,690
In some people you do, if there is an obstruction.

434
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:32,260
Otherwise suddenly you start feeling the cool
breeze and the cool breeze in your hand but

435
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:34,720
you don’t doubt yourself.

436
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,720
That’s one thing.

437
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:36,720
We go on doubting.

438
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:41,050
How can I get it?

439
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:45,590
This and that.

440
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:50,130
Please don’t doubt.

441
00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:55,050
Question: Are there workshops following this
program tomorrow?

442
00:41:55,050 --> 00:42:02,330
[There was no program the next day which Shri
Mataji was unaware of]

443
00:42:02,330 --> 00:42:04,350
Shri Mataji: Not tomorrow?

444
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:05,510
Oh my!

445
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:09,680
I thought, Oh I’m sorry, I would have said
something more.

446
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:10,680
Oh!

447
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:14,700
I thought there is a program tomorrow also.

448
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:19,200
(Talking to a yogi, ‘Why not?

449
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:25,450
I mean such nice people here.

450
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:30,660
Would be better if you could organize something
tomorrow, may be.

451
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:33,430
I am not going tomorrow evening, am I?’)

452
00:42:33,430 --> 00:42:39,190
They fix me like a plug you know from one
place to another.

453
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:43,120
I don’t know, I didn’t know there’s
only program here.

454
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:49,040
I’m sorry about it.

455
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:53,840
Normally always I have two days.

456
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:54,840
It doesn’t matter.

457
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:59,450
As long as you get your realization, you have
to work it out.

458
00:42:59,450 --> 00:43:01,980
It works out and you’ll know each and everything.

459
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:03,660
You’ll become a master.

460
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:06,690
Master of this.

461
00:43:06,690 --> 00:43:16,340
You can give realization to others.

462
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:32,200
Question: Why do you talk of God as a man?

463
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:34,710
Shri Mataji: I’m a woman here.

464
00:43:34,710 --> 00:43:42,110
You should know that between God and His power
there is no quarrel.

465
00:43:42,110 --> 00:43:47,520
His power is the Holy Ghost is a Woman, no
doubt.

466
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:53,970
In india we call Her as Adi Shakti, is the
primordial Mother.

467
00:43:53,970 --> 00:44:00,380
Like the moon and moonlight, the sun and the
sunlight are not two different things.

468
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:05,900
Only in human life we think like a man and
a woman, like that, but do you know, the woman

469
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:07,390
is the power of man.

470
00:44:07,390 --> 00:44:15,650
There’s no quarrel between the two.

471
00:44:15,650 --> 00:44:26,690
Actually, God is just a spectator and the
primordial Mother does all the job, He’s

472
00:44:26,690 --> 00:44:33,530
just a spectator and when He doesn’t like
it, He just finishes the whole thing.

473
00:44:33,530 --> 00:44:35,670
He cancels.

474
00:44:35,670 --> 00:44:51,440
He’s the one who is watching, how the children
of the Mother are going to behave.

475
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:52,440
They do not quarrel.

476
00:44:52,440 --> 00:45:02,530
They don’t go for divorce, nothing of the
kind.

477
00:45:02,530 --> 00:45:10,090
Actually this concept, never came into Christianity
somehow of the Mother and it was played down

478
00:45:10,090 --> 00:45:14,570
very much by Mr Paul who just came into Bible
somehow or the other.

479
00:45:14,570 --> 00:45:20,950
I don’t know why he was there and he didn’t
even want to accept the immaculate conception

480
00:45:20,950 --> 00:45:23,080
as one of the truths.

481
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:33,730
And he fought with all these disciples and
he found a very good platform ready for him

482
00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:41,380
because he was just a officer with the Romans
and he had killed also, one disciple of Christ

483
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:43,380
called Steven.

484
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:45,700
But he just jumped on the stage and he took
over.

485
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:56,160
And then even, I think, he was born as Augustine
and they ruined Christianity completely.

486
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:57,660
Completely!

487
00:45:57,660 --> 00:46:05,180
And it has reached such a horrible state,
specially among protestants now, they have

488
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:10,050
made a, kind of a mental, their approach,
to such a limit, to say that Christ was a

489
00:46:10,050 --> 00:46:11,050
homosexual!

490
00:46:11,050 --> 00:46:52,970
Or to say that, these horrible things, that
really, I don’t want to just say also.

491
00:46:52,970 --> 00:46:55,980
So should we have now.

492
00:46:55,980 --> 00:47:07,960
Self realization all of us.

493
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:17,540
There are two conditions.

494
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:25,970
The first one is, to have full confidence
in yourself.

495
00:47:25,970 --> 00:47:30,020
Those people who tell you, you are sinners
and you have done this wrong and you are all

496
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:36,330
the time guilty about something, I’ve to
make a very humble request that you should

497
00:47:36,330 --> 00:47:42,680
know that you are a human being, not God and
a human being is the only one who can make

498
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:43,680
mistakes.

499
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:50,030
Animals never think that they make mistakes
because they are completely under the control

500
00:47:50,030 --> 00:47:52,950
of God and God’s never make mistakes.

501
00:47:52,950 --> 00:47:57,800
It’s only human beings who are capable of
making mistakes.

502
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:02,070
So there is no need to feel guilty or call
yourself sinners or anything.

503
00:48:02,070 --> 00:48:07,740
Those who call you sinners itself must be
greatest sinners, I think.

504
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:13,130
Every human being has a right to become divine.

505
00:48:13,130 --> 00:48:15,460
So please forgive yourself.

506
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:24,500
Forgot all the past at this moment and know
that you are the Spirit.

507
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:27,680
You are not guilty at all, of, for anything.

508
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:28,680
Just give up all the guilt.

509
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:32,250
It’s also a fashion to have guilt.

510
00:48:32,250 --> 00:48:36,360
Even for small small things, you see, our
modern life has so many norms.

511
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:38,230
Like one gentleman was very upset.

512
00:48:38,230 --> 00:48:41,560
So I said, ‘what’s the matter?’

513
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:43,940
‘I spilled coffee on my dress.’

514
00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:44,940
‘What is there?

515
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:45,940
Doesn’t matter!

516
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:48,460
If coffee is there, it has to spill also.’

517
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:53,010
Such a small nonsensical thing, he couldn’t
sleep for the whole night.

518
00:48:53,010 --> 00:48:59,980
One has to know these are all very very simple
things on which we should not worry our heads

519
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:12,460
and we have to get into that area where we
will enjoy ourselves.

520
00:49:12,460 --> 00:49:14,270
So forget about it.

521
00:49:14,270 --> 00:49:18,290
Just forget and just don’t feel guilty.

522
00:49:18,290 --> 00:49:19,440
Not to feel guilty.

523
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:21,520
Is the first condition.

524
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:30,970
The second condition is that, you have to
forgive everyone.

525
00:49:30,970 --> 00:49:35,630
Now you may say that, ‘it’s very difficult
Mother to forgive everyone.’

526
00:49:35,630 --> 00:49:37,520
But just think logically.

527
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:41,930
Whether you forgive or you don’t forgive,
you don’t do anything.

528
00:49:41,930 --> 00:49:43,530
What do you do?

529
00:49:43,530 --> 00:49:45,680
You don’t do anything.

530
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:47,460
It’s a myth.

531
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:54,480
But if you don’t forgive, then you play
into wrong hands and you torture yourself

532
00:49:54,480 --> 00:50:01,440
while the person who has tortured you, is
quite happy.

533
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:04,000
So you have to forgive in general.

534
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:08,610
Don’t think of each and every person individually.

535
00:50:08,610 --> 00:50:19,880
Just forgive everyone, in such a manner that
you say to yourself ‘I forgive ALL of them.’

536
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:24,250
And you’ll feel very light after that.

537
00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:25,500
You’ll see.

538
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:28,000
You’ll feel much better.

539
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,530
Just forgive.

540
00:50:29,530 --> 00:50:30,530
Forgive everyone.

541
00:50:30,530 --> 00:50:32,910
This is the second condition.

542
00:50:32,910 --> 00:50:34,930
That’s all!

543
00:50:34,930 --> 00:50:44,550
Now to go about it, is very simple, we have
to take the help of the Mother Earth a little

544
00:50:44,550 --> 00:50:45,550
bit.

545
00:50:45,550 --> 00:50:53,080
So if you could take out your shoes for a
while, not the socks but the shoes and put

546
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:56,600
both the feet apart from each other.

547
00:50:56,600 --> 00:51:03,080
Just imagine sitting on the chair, anywhere,
you get your self realization.

548
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:09,260
It’s so simple!

549
00:51:09,260 --> 00:51:22,390
Even in my lecture, if I’ve said something
which might have made you feel guilty, please

550
00:51:22,390 --> 00:51:23,630
forget the lecture also.

551
00:51:23,630 --> 00:51:25,360
Just forget it.

552
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:31,590
Not to feel guilty is very important because
when you feel guilty you spoil the centre

553
00:51:31,590 --> 00:51:35,350
here, on the left hand side (Shri Mataji puts
her hand on left visuddhi) and this causes

554
00:51:35,350 --> 00:51:37,990
a horrible disease called Angina.

555
00:51:37,990 --> 00:51:46,360
Also it causes Spondylitis and many other
lethargic organs diseases.

556
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:57,190
So why do you want to have all these things
just for a myth of a guilt?

557
00:51:57,190 --> 00:52:04,030
Specially Australians are, I think, I don’t
know why they have a guilt but Australians

558
00:52:04,030 --> 00:52:05,500
should not have any guilt at all.

559
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:06,500
For what?

560
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:11,840
You never went into any war, nothing, you
have settled down here far away from the mad

561
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:12,840
world.

562
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:19,570
So why should you have any guilt?

563
00:52:19,570 --> 00:52:24,590
Alright, so now you have to put both your
feet apart from each other because, left and

564
00:52:24,590 --> 00:52:28,040
right, as he must’ve told you, are two powers.

565
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:40,070
One is the power of desire, normal desire
and another one is the power of action.

566
00:52:40,070 --> 00:52:44,180
This one works for the desire (gestures left)
and this one for the action (gestures right).

567
00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:46,540
So we’ll be using both our hands.

568
00:52:46,540 --> 00:52:47,760
He’ll show you how.

569
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:54,750
First you see and you will, yourself activate
your own kundalini.

570
00:52:54,750 --> 00:52:57,340
First you put your left hand towards me like
this.

571
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:59,040
He’ll show you.

572
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:00,360
Please keep your eyes open just now.

573
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:05,470
Then you can close later on when we’ll have
the real procedure.

574
00:53:05,470 --> 00:53:07,720
Just put the left hand like this.

575
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:08,720
Be comfortable.

576
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:13,410
You shouldn’t bend or you shouldn’t push
yourself back too much but sit comfortably.

577
00:53:13,410 --> 00:53:15,630
Be comfortable.

578
00:53:15,630 --> 00:53:26,050
Now please put the left hand like this – this
is symbolic that you want to have your realization.

579
00:53:26,050 --> 00:53:34,610
And you have to put your right hand on your
different centers, symbolic of the action

580
00:53:34,610 --> 00:53:36,960
that you are taking.

581
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:42,330
Actually it is no action but you are nourishing
your centers by placing your hand on these

582
00:53:42,330 --> 00:53:44,330
different centers.

583
00:53:44,330 --> 00:53:48,060
So you put your right hand on your heart.

584
00:53:48,060 --> 00:53:49,810
It’s very good.

585
00:53:49,810 --> 00:53:52,250
All of you should do it.

586
00:53:52,250 --> 00:54:01,840
Please put your right hand on your heart.

587
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:12,540
In the heart I’ve told you is the reflection
of God Almighty, the Spirit.

588
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:15,360
We’ll be working only on the left hand side.

589
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:28,820
We take our right hand now on the upper portion
of our abdomen on the left hand side.

590
00:54:28,820 --> 00:54:31,930
This is the centre of your mastery.

591
00:54:31,930 --> 00:54:40,980
The mastery of yoga by which you yourself
can give realization to others.

592
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:49,420
And this centre was created by great prophets
and great saints.

593
00:54:49,420 --> 00:55:00,630
Then we take our hand onto the lower portion
of our abdomen on the left hand side and press

594
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:02,490
it hard.

595
00:55:02,490 --> 00:55:06,600
This is the centre of pure knowledge.

596
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:07,600
Of pure knowledge.

597
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:17,180
Pure knowledge is the knowledge which gives
you the full understanding or gives, empowers

598
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:21,680
you, to work out the divine power.

599
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:27,400
That’s the pure knowledge.

600
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:39,930
Then you raise your hand again back, on the
right side of your abdomen in the upper portion

601
00:55:39,930 --> 00:55:42,240
and press it hard.

602
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:47,460
This is again is the principal of mastery,
‘Guru tattwa’ as they call it.

603
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:58,240
Then again you raise your right hand on your
heart.

604
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:04,410
Now you place your right hand in the corner
of your neck and your shoulder.

605
00:56:04,410 --> 00:56:07,090
Place it back.

606
00:56:07,090 --> 00:56:09,110
As far as possible.

607
00:56:09,110 --> 00:56:12,830
This is very important.

608
00:56:12,830 --> 00:56:23,000
This centre as I told you is, if in jeopardy,
then you get horrible diseases.

609
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:26,000
Now turn your head to your right.

610
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:30,740
This is the centre where you have to say you
are not guilty.

611
00:56:30,740 --> 00:56:34,370
This we’ll do later on.

612
00:56:34,370 --> 00:56:40,640
Now please take your right hand on top of
your forehead across.

613
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:49,110
Press it like this and put down your head
fully on it.

614
00:56:49,110 --> 00:56:54,660
This is the centre.

615
00:56:54,660 --> 00:57:08,060
Now, here you bend your head and here you
have to forgive everyone.

616
00:57:08,060 --> 00:57:13,950
This is the centre of Christ.

617
00:57:13,950 --> 00:57:18,360
One window of that centre we can call, is
in the front.

618
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:21,820
Another one is on the back.

619
00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:25,290
Where you put your right hand on the backside
of your head.

620
00:57:25,290 --> 00:57:27,060
Backside of your head.

621
00:57:27,060 --> 00:57:32,530
Press back your head, as far as possible.

622
00:57:32,530 --> 00:57:44,300
Here is the centre where, for your own satisfaction,
without feeling guilty you have to ask forgiveness

623
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:47,480
from the divine, if you have done any mistakes.

624
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:49,420
Is for only your satisfaction.

625
00:57:49,420 --> 00:57:55,760
You don’t have to feel guilty about it or
think about your own mistakes.

626
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:56,760
Just you have to ask.

627
00:57:56,760 --> 00:58:00,580
Please push back your head.

628
00:58:00,580 --> 00:58:11,920
Now, please stretch your right hand fully
and put the centre of your palm exactly on

629
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:16,660
the fontanelle bone area, which was a soft
bone in your childhood.

630
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:19,360
Press it nicely.

631
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:25,240
Push back your fingers, put down your head
as much as you can.

632
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:28,910
Put down your head and now press it hard.

633
00:58:28,910 --> 00:58:36,070
This is the last centre and now start moving
your scalp with a big pressure.

634
00:58:36,070 --> 00:58:37,180
Push back your fingers.

635
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:38,400
Very important.

636
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:41,440
Move it 7 times.

637
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:47,900
You will know why 7 times and why it is so
many times.

638
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:49,460
Clockwise.

639
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:51,020
Slowly.

640
00:58:51,020 --> 00:59:00,400
That’s all you have to do.

641
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:03,520
That’s all.

642
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:08,820
Now, we have to close our eyes.

643
00:59:08,820 --> 00:59:11,390
Before that I would say, you can take out
your glasses.

644
00:59:11,390 --> 00:59:13,730
It might help your eyesight.

645
00:59:13,730 --> 00:59:27,010
You don’t open your eyes till I tell you.

646
00:59:27,010 --> 00:59:33,130
If you have anything tight around your neck
or around your waist, you can make it little

647
00:59:33,130 --> 00:59:36,820
loose because, may be, it might make you uncomfortable.

648
00:59:36,820 --> 00:59:39,500
If it is not making you uncomfortable it’s
alright.

649
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:44,760
So now you have sit little straight, that’s
all, not too much strain on your back.

650
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:46,940
But in a straight way.

651
00:59:46,940 --> 00:59:53,990
And now please put your left hand towards
me and right hand on your heart and now please

652
00:59:53,990 --> 00:59:57,730
close your eyes.

653
00:59:57,730 --> 01:00:03,320
As I told you, you have to desire for self
realization.

654
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:07,750
I cannot force on you.

655
01:00:07,750 --> 01:00:12,850
Now here you have to say or ask a question
to me.

656
01:00:12,850 --> 01:00:17,220
You can call me ‘Mother’ or ‘Shri Mataji,’
whatever you feel like.

657
01:00:17,220 --> 01:00:23,610
‘Mother, am I the Spirit?’

658
01:00:23,610 --> 01:00:31,230
Like a computer you’re asking a question
because you have to become a divine computer.

659
01:00:31,230 --> 01:00:35,730
Where the whole programming is within yourself.

660
01:00:35,730 --> 01:00:51,550
So now ask a question 3 times ‘Mother, am
I the Spirit?’

661
01:00:51,550 --> 01:00:59,500
In your heart.

662
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:08,190
Now, if you are the Spirit, you are your master.

663
01:01:08,190 --> 01:01:17,050
So please take down your right hand in the
upper portion of your abdomen.

664
01:01:17,050 --> 01:01:18,440
On the left hand side.

665
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:21,380
Keep the left hand towards me and both the
feet apart.

666
01:01:21,380 --> 01:01:24,540
Please don’t open your eyes till I tell
you.

667
01:01:24,540 --> 01:01:32,360
Now here, you ask me another question 3 times,
‘Mother, am I my own master?’Ask this

668
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:36,620
question 3 times in your heart.

669
01:01:36,620 --> 01:01:42,430
Do not doubt yourself.

670
01:01:42,430 --> 01:01:46,610
You have to know that I cannot force pure
knowledge on you.

671
01:01:46,610 --> 01:01:48,430
You have your own freedom.

672
01:01:48,430 --> 01:01:51,280
If you don’t want it, I cannot do it.

673
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:53,690
So you have to ask for it.

674
01:01:53,690 --> 01:01:59,780
So now you can put your right hand in the
lower portion of your abdomen, on the left

675
01:01:59,780 --> 01:02:02,010
hand side and press it hard.

676
01:02:02,010 --> 01:02:11,520
And here you have to say, ‘Mother, please
give me pure knowledge.’

677
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:18,350
‘Shri Mataji, give me please pure knowledge.’

678
01:02:18,350 --> 01:02:32,900
You have to say this 6 times because this
centre has got 6 petals.

679
01:02:32,900 --> 01:02:42,460
As soon as you ask for pure knowledge, the
kundalini starts moving upward.

680
01:02:42,460 --> 01:02:53,310
So we have to just nourish the upper centers
with our self confidence.

681
01:02:53,310 --> 01:03:02,460
Sow now please, raise your right hand in the
upper portion of your abdomen on the left

682
01:03:02,460 --> 01:03:06,750
hand side.

683
01:03:06,750 --> 01:03:20,810
Here you have to say with full confidence,10
times,‘Mother, I am my own master.’

684
01:03:20,810 --> 01:03:38,940
Say it with full confidence, ‘Mother, I
am my own master.’

685
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:45,750
Say it sincerely and with self confidence.

686
01:03:45,750 --> 01:03:55,020
I’ve already told you at the very outset
that the truth about, is that, you are not

687
01:03:55,020 --> 01:04:09,590
this body, not this mind, not this ego nor
these conditionings but you are the pure Spirit.

688
01:04:09,590 --> 01:04:18,080
So now please raise your right hand on your
heart.

689
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:30,340
And here you say with full confidence again,12
times,

690
01:04:30,340 --> 01:04:37,070
‘Mother, I am the Spirit.’

691
01:04:37,070 --> 01:04:51,920
Please say it 12 times.

692
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:59,660
I’ve already told you that you are not God.

693
01:04:59,660 --> 01:05:08,070
You are a human being and if you have done
any mistakes, there’s nothing to worry about

694
01:05:08,070 --> 01:05:10,160
it.

695
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:14,770
So do not feel guilty.

696
01:05:14,770 --> 01:05:28,510
At this present moment you better forget the
past and completely forgive yourself.

697
01:05:28,510 --> 01:05:39,590
Now place your right hand in the corner of
your shoulder and your neck.

698
01:05:39,590 --> 01:05:41,550
And turn your head to your right.

699
01:05:41,550 --> 01:05:53,760
Here you have to say with full confidence
in yourself, 16 times, ‘Mother, I am not

700
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:55,470
guilty at all.’

701
01:05:55,470 --> 01:06:13,850
Please say, 16 times, ‘Mother, I am not
guilty at all.’

702
01:06:13,850 --> 01:06:33,460
Now, we have to know that this divine power
is the ocean of love, ocean of knowledge,

703
01:06:33,460 --> 01:06:45,800
ocean of joy but above all, it is the ocean
of forgiveness and whatever mistakes we commit,

704
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:59,460
it can be dissolved into this great power
of ocean of forgiveness.

705
01:06:59,460 --> 01:07:09,330
Now raise your right hand onto your forehead
across and put down your head on it.

706
01:07:09,330 --> 01:07:21,270
Here as I told you, you have to say, ‘Mother,
I forgive everyone in general.’

707
01:07:21,270 --> 01:07:29,450
As I have explained to you that whether you
forgive or don’t forgive, you don’t do

708
01:07:29,450 --> 01:07:34,090
anything but if you don’t forgive, you play
into wrong hands.

709
01:07:34,090 --> 01:07:44,120
So please say it, from your heart.

710
01:07:44,120 --> 01:07:58,350
Not how many times, say it, from your heart,
‘Mother, I forgive everyone.’

711
01:07:58,350 --> 01:08:07,200
Now without feeling guilty, without counting
your mistakes, just for your satisfaction,

712
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:12,370
you have to ask for forgiveness from the divine
power.

713
01:08:12,370 --> 01:08:18,190
So now please put your right hand on the backside
of your head and push back your head as far

714
01:08:18,190 --> 01:08:21,140
as possible.

715
01:08:21,140 --> 01:08:32,670
Here you have to
say with full confidence, without feeling

716
01:08:32,670 --> 01:08:39,580
guilty, without counting your mistakes, ‘O
divine power, if I have done any mistakes,

717
01:08:39,580 --> 01:08:42,860
knowingly or unknowingly, please forgive me.’

718
01:08:42,860 --> 01:08:44,900
Say it again, from your heart.

719
01:08:44,900 --> 01:08:47,270
It’s not important how many times.

720
01:08:47,270 --> 01:08:56,680
From your heart!

721
01:08:56,680 --> 01:09:17,740
Now, stretch your hand, fully, right hand
and put the centre of your palm on top of

722
01:09:17,740 --> 01:09:23,790
your head, on the fontanelle bone area, which
was a soft bone in your childhood.Now, put

723
01:09:23,790 --> 01:09:25,370
it down.

724
01:09:25,370 --> 01:09:32,180
Put it down as much as you can.

725
01:09:32,180 --> 01:09:34,160
Put down your head.

726
01:09:34,160 --> 01:09:37,090
Now, push back your fingers.

727
01:09:37,090 --> 01:09:38,590
Push back your fingers.

728
01:09:38,590 --> 01:09:43,220
So there’s lot of pressure on the scalp.

729
01:09:43,220 --> 01:09:49,750
Here again, I cannot force self realization
on you.

730
01:09:49,750 --> 01:09:52,440
You have to ask for it.

731
01:09:52,440 --> 01:09:55,920
I respect your freedom.

732
01:09:55,920 --> 01:10:09,160
So please, move your hand 7 times, clockwise,
slowly, saying 7 times, ‘Mother, please

733
01:10:09,160 --> 01:10:11,790
give me self realization.’

734
01:10:11,790 --> 01:10:18,780
Please say it 7 times, ‘Mother, please give
me self realization.’

735
01:10:18,780 --> 01:10:22,310
Now put the hand properly.

736
01:10:22,310 --> 01:10:24,750
This is a very important procedure.

737
01:10:24,750 --> 01:10:28,820
Put the hand properly on the fontanelle bone
area.

738
01:10:28,820 --> 01:10:30,960
Put down your head.

739
01:10:30,960 --> 01:11:25,500
Press it hard and move it very slowly, clockwise.

740
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:33,220
Now please take down your hands.

741
01:11:33,220 --> 01:11:39,370
Now please put both your hands towards me
like this and watch me without thinking.

742
01:11:39,370 --> 01:11:43,770
Both the hands towards me.

743
01:11:43,770 --> 01:11:51,040
Now, the right hand you put like this, bend
your head and see for yourself if there’s

744
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:55,240
a cool breeze coming out of your fontanelle
bone area.

745
01:11:55,240 --> 01:12:02,150
Now hold the hand, above, not on top of your
head, and see for your, bend your head.

746
01:12:02,150 --> 01:12:08,610
See for yourself with your left hand if there’s
a cool breeze or a hot breeze in some cases,

747
01:12:08,610 --> 01:12:10,740
is coming out of your own head.

748
01:12:10,740 --> 01:12:12,100
You have to certify yourself.

749
01:12:12,100 --> 01:12:13,830
Now bend your head.

750
01:12:13,830 --> 01:12:15,540
Please bend your head.

751
01:12:15,540 --> 01:12:18,150
Please bend your head, bend it.

752
01:12:18,150 --> 01:12:20,300
Bending will help you better.

753
01:12:20,300 --> 01:12:21,300
Now concentrate.

754
01:12:21,300 --> 01:12:23,220
Don’t put it on top.

755
01:12:23,220 --> 01:12:28,800
Some people get it quite far away and move
your hand all over to see if there’s a cool

756
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:35,210
breeze coming out of it.

757
01:12:35,210 --> 01:12:44,110
Now, please take the left hand like this.

758
01:12:44,110 --> 01:12:47,380
Put the left hand towards me.

759
01:12:47,380 --> 01:12:55,840
Now again, bend your head and please see with
your right hand if there’s cool breeze or

760
01:12:55,840 --> 01:13:01,630
a hot breeze or heat coming out of your head.

761
01:13:01,630 --> 01:13:03,550
Please see.

762
01:13:03,550 --> 01:13:06,460
Move your hand.

763
01:13:06,460 --> 01:13:14,670
Some people get it very far also.

764
01:13:14,670 --> 01:13:28,730
Now, please put your right hand towards me
and again with the left hand, bend your head

765
01:13:28,730 --> 01:13:35,680
and again see for yourself.

766
01:13:35,680 --> 01:13:45,630
Now, push back both your hands towards the
sky.

767
01:13:45,630 --> 01:13:49,150
Both your hands towards the sky.

768
01:13:49,150 --> 01:14:01,190
Push back your head completely and ask a question
3 times, ‘Mother, is this the all pervading

769
01:14:01,190 --> 01:14:21,150
power of God’s love?’Just ask this question
3 times.

770
01:14:21,150 --> 01:14:24,070
Please take down both your hands.

771
01:14:24,070 --> 01:14:35,770
Push both the hands towards me and watch me
without thinking.This is the first stage which

772
01:14:35,770 --> 01:14:43,300
we call in Sanskrit as ‘Nirvichar Samadhi’
and in English it is ‘thoughtless awareness’

773
01:14:43,300 --> 01:14:46,080
where there is no thought.

774
01:14:46,080 --> 01:14:49,870
So you have crossed this and you have crossed
this also.

775
01:14:49,870 --> 01:14:55,670
But it is to be established still further,
in a proper way.

776
01:14:55,670 --> 01:15:03,090
All those who have felt cool or hot breeze
out of their heads or on their fingers, on

777
01:15:03,090 --> 01:15:11,070
their hands, please raise both your hands.

778
01:15:11,070 --> 01:15:18,760
Imagine the whole of Perth has felt it, practically!

779
01:15:18,760 --> 01:15:22,360
May God Bless You!

780
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:27,780
Some of you have not felt.

781
01:15:27,780 --> 01:15:29,590
Doesn’t matter.

782
01:15:29,590 --> 01:15:30,590
It will work out.

783
01:15:30,590 --> 01:15:32,340
Maybe, you must be thinking about something.

784
01:15:32,340 --> 01:15:38,720
I don’t know what happened.

785
01:15:38,720 --> 01:15:46,950
So now we have to know that we have got the
first breakthrough but this connection has

786
01:15:46,950 --> 01:15:49,840
to be fully established.

787
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:56,720
Has to be fully manifested within our being.

788
01:15:56,720 --> 01:16:02,050
So whatever we have achieved, we have to work
it out in such a manner that we know what

789
01:16:02,050 --> 01:16:05,990
it is.

790
01:16:05,990 --> 01:16:09,320
I would like to meet you because I may not
be able to meet you tomorrow.

791
01:16:09,320 --> 01:16:10,850
I’m so sorry.

792
01:16:10,850 --> 01:16:18,750
So if you can come around, I would like to
meet you and talk to you about it. May God Bless You! Thank you!
