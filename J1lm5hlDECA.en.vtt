01:12.703 --> 01:26.903
Tonight we had decided to talk about Creation
but our management has not been able to provide

01:26.903 --> 01:38.843
me with a chalk and with a blackboard so,
I don’t know, I’ll try to explain it without

01:38.843 --> 01:39.843
drawing.

01:39.843 --> 01:42.762
It’s a very difficult subject.

01:42.762 --> 01:52.213
And I’ll try to make it intelligible.

01:52.213 --> 02:17.423
But I would request you to pay full attention
for such a difficult subject like Creation.

02:17.423 --> 02:28.243
The greatest blessing today is that many of
you can feel the vibrations.

02:28.243 --> 02:37.103
And not only that but you also know and realise
that they can think and they can love.

02:37.103 --> 02:38.753
It’s a very big blessing.

02:38.753 --> 02:44.413
Of course, some of you haven’t got it, but
those who have got it know that these vibrations

02:44.413 --> 02:49.793
organise, because they raise the Kundalini,
they go to the place where it is needed, out

02:49.793 --> 02:53.563
of compassion, to that portion where there
is deficiency.

02:53.563 --> 02:59.533
They understand, they organise they are universal
in nature and they love.

02:59.533 --> 03:11.642
They answer to your questions, when you ask
them some questions – you receive answer

03:11.642 --> 03:13.373
from them.

03:13.373 --> 03:16.843
They are living vibrations.

03:16.843 --> 03:22.982
These vibrations are from the Divine.

03:22.982 --> 03:36.563
This Divine is called as Brahma, Brahma Tattwa,
Principle of Divine.

03:36.563 --> 03:50.772
We can say that the process of Creation is
an eternal process.

03:50.772 --> 03:55.113
Means a seed becomes a tree and the tree becomes
a seed, and the seed becomes a tree, and it

03:55.113 --> 03:57.192
goes on and on – it’s eternal.

03:57.192 --> 04:03.632
So, it cannot have a starting point and it
cannot have an ending point.

04:03.632 --> 04:06.423
It goes on and on and on.

04:06.423 --> 04:14.162
That’s why it can have different states
of existence, you can say, state of being.

04:14.162 --> 04:19.093
So, the first, just the being, is Brahma,
where nothing exists.

04:19.093 --> 04:20.093
We say ‘nothing’.

04:20.093 --> 04:28.962
When we say nothing, it is a relative word:
because we do not exist, so we say ‘nothing

04:28.962 --> 04:32.182
exists’ – it’s a relative word.

04:32.182 --> 04:37.542
When we are not existing, for us everything
is ‘nothing’.

04:37.542 --> 04:38.542
There is something, but that is not ourselves.

04:38.542 --> 04:45.512
And that’s why, relatively, we say it is
‘nothing’.

04:45.512 --> 04:49.742
It’s only the word Brahma, we can say.

04:49.742 --> 04:59.453
You can think of an energy, if you want to,
an energy-form that exists.

04:59.453 --> 05:12.352
But the energy accumulates at a point and
forms a nucleus.

05:12.352 --> 05:24.042
The energy that thinks, energy that is distributed,
accumulates at a point, concentrates on a

05:24.042 --> 05:32.573
point, you can say, and this point is the
point we call as Sadashiva.

05:32.573 --> 05:39.113
This happens because that energy desires,
thinks, organises, loves.

05:39.113 --> 05:53.653
When it wants to create, when the desire is
felt in that energy to create, at that time

05:53.653 --> 05:59.143
a nucleus is created.

05:59.143 --> 06:00.783
This nucleus we call as Sadashiva.

06:00.783 --> 06:02.543
This nucleus does not disappear.

06:02.543 --> 06:07.553
You can think of a nebula.

06:07.553 --> 06:13.203
I mean, it is something which is all relative
you can think, you cannot think something

06:13.203 --> 06:14.423
in absolute form.

06:14.423 --> 06:19.853
So, with thinking you cannot conceptualise
the whole thing, but if you can think of a

06:19.853 --> 06:27.683
state, where it’s just an energy and no
creation.

06:27.683 --> 06:29.773
But not the energy of electricity, magnetism
– all these things.

06:29.773 --> 06:37.743
Is the combination, the synthesis of all the
things which goes into laya which becomes

06:37.743 --> 06:40.403
that, dissolves into that.

06:40.403 --> 06:56.243
It coagulates on a point, that may be a [suitable]
word, coagulates at a point which we can call

06:56.243 --> 06:59.243
as a nucleus.

06:59.243 --> 07:04.373
This point we call as Sadashiva.

07:04.373 --> 07:16.713
This Sadashiva is the Ishwara, is the God
Almighty.

07:16.713 --> 07:18.073
We call it now “God” because now it has
a limitation.

07:18.073 --> 07:20.963
In the sense that we can call it something.

07:20.963 --> 07:27.003
But if it is just an energy we just call it
a Brahma.

07:27.003 --> 07:37.833
You can say like this: when the water becomes
ice, a follicle of ice is formed, you can

07:37.833 --> 07:45.913
differentiate between the water and the ice,
but still, it’s a relative, relative understanding.

07:45.913 --> 07:57.343
At this state God Almighty, Parameshwara,
takes its form as an identity.

07:57.343 --> 08:04.783
That’s why we can say that it is not Brahma,
but an identity.

08:04.783 --> 08:11.283
Identity has its aura, has its aura, we can
say, its light.

08:11.283 --> 08:15.383
This light is the Divine Love.

08:15.383 --> 08:26.893
It goes into various forms but Sadashiva remains
as He is.

08:26.893 --> 08:39.783
Now, the desire to create is transferred to
the aura.

08:39.783 --> 08:48.363
The aura is the Power of God, Shakti.

08:48.363 --> 08:57.393
Ishwara has certain things beyond Him also
and before Him.

08:57.393 --> 09:06.813
God Almighty has something beyond Him that
He cannot control: one, He cannot control

09:06.813 --> 09:08.463
His eternal nature.

09:08.463 --> 09:13.423
It is His nature to be eternal, He cannot
stop it.

09:13.423 --> 09:20.393
He will go on changing His form, it is His
nature, it just… it is His swabhava.

09:20.393 --> 09:21.603
He cannot change it, His eternal nature.

09:21.603 --> 09:22.603
He will be eternally.

09:22.603 --> 09:27.832
Eternity is His temperament, His nature, He
cannot overcome that.

09:27.832 --> 09:38.063
For example, God cannot take away your freedom
to choose the Truth.

09:38.063 --> 09:39.063
He cannot.

09:39.063 --> 09:41.543
Once He has granted, He’s not going to take
it away.

09:41.543 --> 09:46.552
You have to choose it in all your freedom.

09:46.552 --> 09:49.153
He will not force you to take it.

09:49.153 --> 09:52.213
Many people have hopes like that – they
are sadly mistaken.

09:52.213 --> 09:58.513
At this juncture only lies the problem of
complete destruction or complete resurrection.

09:58.513 --> 10:04.432
It is left into the hands of human beings
to decide whether they want to accept the

10:04.432 --> 10:09.023
Truth or if they want to follow the falsehood.

10:09.023 --> 10:13.912
So, you have [been] given complete freedom
to choose.

10:13.912 --> 10:20.203
I won’t go into the details about God Almighty,
because it’s a very subtler subject and

10:20.203 --> 10:21.573
requires much more attention.

10:21.573 --> 10:28.223
I have talked about it before to many people
and all His nature, they know that.

10:28.223 --> 10:36.112
But He is the Witness, He is the Sakshi (witness)
in the form of a Sakshi.

10:36.112 --> 10:37.182
What is He witnessing?

10:37.182 --> 10:41.033
He is witnessing the Creation.

10:41.033 --> 10:47.482
And the power that creates the Creation is
the Shakti, is His power, is His consort.

10:47.482 --> 10:57.742
Now, for us, human beings, we don’t understand
that a wife and a husband could be that one

10:57.742 --> 10:58.742
(unified).

10:58.742 --> 11:03.583
For example, you can understand like a Sun
and a sunlight, Moon and the Moonlight – as

11:03.583 --> 11:05.932
these two things are one and the same.

11:05.932 --> 11:09.002
Or the meaning and the word.

11:09.002 --> 11:10.573
In the same way, Shiva and Shakti are one
together.

11:10.573 --> 11:16.872
For example, you can be a father, you can
be a mother.

11:16.872 --> 11:24.782
You can be a father, you can be a brother,
you can be a son – three things you are

11:24.782 --> 11:26.023
doing together.

11:26.023 --> 11:29.692
In the same way, you can be your Self and
your power.

11:29.692 --> 11:35.713
You know: you and your Self and your power
are different, but you are one.

11:35.713 --> 11:40.223
You have a power to write, but you are not
your power.

11:40.223 --> 11:44.033
Neither your power is your Self.

11:44.033 --> 11:52.963
In the same way, Shiva and Shakti are two
persons to be identified, but they are part

11:52.963 --> 11:57.133
and parcel of one uniform thing known as ‘Brahma’.

11:57.133 --> 12:06.122
But these horrible Tantrikas – again they
come round here – have spoiled the relationship

12:06.122 --> 12:08.893
between Shiva and Shakti.

12:08.893 --> 12:12.763
Not that they were human beings, that’s
why they established all these funny ideas

12:12.763 --> 12:15.823
and talked about these nonsensical things.

12:15.823 --> 12:19.903
Because they are the people who are nothing
but their sex-points.

12:19.903 --> 12:22.153
They are nothing nobler than that.

12:22.153 --> 12:24.843
They are very depraved and diseased and debased
people.

12:24.843 --> 12:29.543
They suffer from such a terrible disease that
no way they can see anything else but this.

12:29.543 --> 12:32.213
Ashvameda has also described as something
to do with sex.

12:32.213 --> 12:33.472
Everything they look, they see sex there.

12:33.472 --> 12:42.982
It’s like a person, as we call it in Hindi
– [HINDI 13:00 mins] – who is wearing

12:42.982 --> 12:47.562
the glass of sex and watching through that
life, everything becomes sex, sex, sex, they

12:47.562 --> 12:52.013
are such debased and horrible depraved people,
even God, they are bringing to that level.

12:52.013 --> 12:59.453
Unless and until they are bringing to that
level, they cannot exist.

12:59.453 --> 13:02.513
How will they justify themselves, the way
they are?

13:02.513 --> 13:11.663
Sex has nothing to do with Shiva and Shakti.

13:11.663 --> 13:13.282
What is Sun and sunlight?

13:13.282 --> 13:17.062
Is there any sex involved there?

13:17.062 --> 13:19.043
Is there nothing existing without sex for
these horrible tantrikas?

13:19.043 --> 13:25.252
Is there no relationship that exists without
sex?

13:25.252 --> 13:36.703
So, Shiva is the God Almighty – we should
call him as Sadashiva.

13:36.703 --> 13:42.302
I’ll try to draw a little bit, let us see
how it works out.

13:42.302 --> 13:45.573
Now forming into a nucleus like this.

13:45.573 --> 13:54.472
Now, this is the remains of the nucleus, you
can say, which forms its power here into a

13:54.472 --> 13:55.472
valaya.

13:55.472 --> 13:57.823
How does it form?

13:57.823 --> 14:03.893
He moves supposing backwards, you can say.

14:03.893 --> 14:12.363
Then what happens when he moves backwards…kara
noko (marathi: don’t do that)…this, whole

14:12.363 --> 14:29.653
thing like this, remains here and all of this
passes, forms a shell around it and the waves

14:29.653 --> 14:38.732
cross over and settle onto the shell – here.

14:38.732 --> 14:52.342
Now, this is the situation: when all inside
forms another nucleus here by concentration

14:52.342 --> 14:55.802
– this is the Shakti.

14:55.802 --> 14:56.802
And this is the Sadashiva.

14:56.802 --> 15:03.143
This is the Mahashakti, you can say ‘Adi
Shakti’ and this is the Sadashiva.

15:03.143 --> 15:17.412
Now here, Shiva, once the Shakti forms Her
personality, or we can say, Her ego is established,

15:17.412 --> 15:19.773
She is a different identity from Shiva.

15:19.773 --> 15:25.622
Because the whole process is to create the
play for the witness to see.

15:25.622 --> 15:28.532
He is the One who is going to watch the play.

15:28.532 --> 15:31.422
She is the One who is going to create it.

15:31.422 --> 15:40.523
So, She accumulates Her ego onto a point here
and becomes Shakti, assumes a position there.

15:40.523 --> 15:51.013
And the first thing She does as a Shakti is
to go round in a parabolic…in a parabola

15:51.013 --> 15:53.842
around Her Lord.

15:53.842 --> 15:56.542
This point one must understand.

15:56.542 --> 16:00.502
She is a Shakti, is the Power of God.

16:00.502 --> 16:06.042
And the whole Creation is only meant for God
Almighty to be seen.

16:06.042 --> 16:11.002
He’s the only spectator of the play of Shakti.

16:11.002 --> 16:15.442
And if He doesn’t like the play, for example,
He doesn’t like the way it is or the way

16:15.442 --> 16:21.942
people are that are created, He can immediately
stop the play by closing His eyes, by denying

16:21.942 --> 16:28.883
the play, by showing His annoyance or by His
stopper, He can just stop it.

16:28.883 --> 16:32.312
That’s why He is also called as a destroyer.

16:32.312 --> 16:34.203
But the whole thing is meant for His amusement.

16:34.203 --> 16:39.533
And if it doesn’t give Him pleasure, He
can stop it.

16:39.533 --> 16:45.423
That’s why the first one who must be pleased
is the One who is the spectator.

16:45.423 --> 17:00.633
Because of this, Shiva is garlanded by Her,
is a parabola and that’s why parabola is

17:00.633 --> 17:03.523
the symbol of Adi Shakti.

17:03.523 --> 17:11.124
This is sort of a certificate to Her, a sort
of a granting Her the varadan, as we call

17:11.124 --> 17:14.263
it in Sanskrit language, is the varadan that
‘go ahead with your work.’

17:14.263 --> 17:17.412
This is a sanction given to Him.

17:17.412 --> 17:23.182
When She completes this parabola, the sanction
has been granted and that’s why She is a

17:23.182 --> 17:24.182
parabola.

17:24.182 --> 17:28.532
Here the question of men dominating the women
and women dominating the men does not come

17:28.532 --> 17:30.932
in, because this is predominantly in our heads,
you see.

17:30.932 --> 17:35.752
When we think of it, we think of men and women,
it is nothing of the kind.

17:35.752 --> 17:37.133
It’s just complete Oneness.

17:37.133 --> 17:41.263
Can we think of one couple which is absolutely
united with each other?

17:41.263 --> 17:42.333
We cannot.

17:42.333 --> 17:45.213
Because we are all incomplete people.

17:45.213 --> 17:49.583
But if you could stretch your imagination
to such a point that both of them are meant

17:49.583 --> 17:56.492
for each other only and the One who is active,
is the Adi Shakti, is only active to please

17:56.492 --> 18:05.652
the God Almighty Who is the only spectator
of Her play and He’s to be pleased first.

18:05.652 --> 18:11.203
So, She surrenders Herself before Him, takes
the sanction through the parabola.

18:11.203 --> 18:14.532
Now, parabola is a very important thing.

18:14.532 --> 18:19.983
You know that everything travels through parabola,
never in a straight line.

18:19.983 --> 18:25.713
For example, if you love someone, our love
goes round that person and comes back to us

18:25.713 --> 18:27.463
as love.

18:27.463 --> 18:34.343
But if you hate that person, then our hatred
goes round that person and comes back to us

18:34.343 --> 18:37.003
as a terrible hatred.

18:37.003 --> 18:43.493
So, the parabola is taken, but you might say
‘why a parabola?’

18:43.493 --> 18:47.943
The question can be: “Why should there be
a parabola and not a circle?”

18:47.943 --> 18:55.523
The reason is: parabola is the shortest distance
to go round another point, is the shortest.

18:55.523 --> 18:56.523
And that’s why it’s a parabola.

18:56.523 --> 19:06.173
It is even in our ordinary life, you will
find this happening: that whatever you do

19:06.173 --> 19:11.213
to others, it comes back to you in some form,
whether you do good or bad.

19:11.213 --> 19:17.823
And that’s why our karmic ideas and that
of our doing punyas are all there.

19:17.823 --> 19:22.823
Because whatever we emit through us, will
come back to us.

19:22.823 --> 19:28.283
In the same way, if you bless the whole world,
the blessings of the whole world will come

19:28.283 --> 19:29.703
to us.

19:29.703 --> 19:36.623
As I told you, the process is not that simple
as it can be drawn, because it’s a living

19:36.623 --> 19:43.903
process of a big dimension but I’m just
trying to make it simpler for you to understand.

19:43.903 --> 19:54.313
Now, this parabola, when, here now, when She
is, She goes into the motion of a parabola

19:54.313 --> 20:00.963
and Shiva sanctioned Her, sanctions Her – it’s
a living process, again you must understand,

20:00.963 --> 20:04.553
it’s a living process, it’s as human as
we are.

20:04.553 --> 20:08.433
Both of them are as human as we are, we should
say, they are thousand times more human than

20:08.433 --> 20:09.433
we are.

20:09.433 --> 20:17.323
So, here the Wife, His Consort, says that:
“I am very happy just like this.

20:17.323 --> 20:21.813
I won’t go any further with it."

20:21.813 --> 20:25.293
Because Creation is not an easy thing for
Her, She doesn’t want to depart from Her

20:25.293 --> 20:26.293
Creation.

20:26.293 --> 20:34.363
Creation is the child and She says, “I would
not like to have children now, because I will

20:34.363 --> 20:35.363
lose you."

20:35.363 --> 20:42.833
So, She pushes Herself towards Him and He
pushes Her back and disappears, opening out

20:42.833 --> 20:44.643
from here.

20:44.643 --> 20:50.073
Now She is in this form.

20:50.073 --> 20:54.533
So, the beginning of the Om starts.

20:54.533 --> 20:59.983
Parabola, first of all, gets converted into
Om.

20:59.983 --> 21:11.513
Then She pushes Herself down and settles down
for a while to meditate and to find out how

21:11.513 --> 21:13.833
She is going to work it out, we can say like
this.

21:13.833 --> 21:17.523
You see, it is Her desire which must be aroused.

21:17.523 --> 21:22.653
If Her desire is not aroused, She will not
conceive the Creation.

21:22.653 --> 21:24.893
So, a kalpa is spent in that.

21:24.893 --> 21:29.013
Quite a lot of time is spent in Her own thinking
– which way She should do it.

21:29.013 --> 21:30.513
She has created many universes.

21:30.513 --> 21:32.803
It is not one universe She has created.

21:32.803 --> 21:36.893
She has created universes after universes
and I will show you how She has created so

21:36.893 --> 21:37.893
many universes.

21:37.893 --> 21:40.913
And some of them are still lingering on, some
of them are destroyed.

21:40.913 --> 21:46.023
But today before us: this Universe, this Earth,
on this Earth, India and in India, Delhi,

21:46.023 --> 21:47.923
you are sitting attending this place.

21:47.923 --> 21:48.923
It’s like that.

21:48.923 --> 21:53.153
So, at this moment, whatever is the thing,
is not the past, nor the future, but I’m

21:53.153 --> 21:55.853
telling you about the present moment we are
here.

21:55.853 --> 22:00.283
But many universes have been created by Adi
Shakti; even before us.

22:00.283 --> 22:02.903
And She has tried many other things also.

22:02.903 --> 22:05.803
Ultimately She has tried this.

22:05.803 --> 22:08.693
She has created Earth and then created us.

22:08.693 --> 22:11.593
Now, how She has done that we’ll see later
on.

22:11.593 --> 22:17.483
Just now let us see how She assumes her powers.

22:17.483 --> 22:30.123
When She decides to create, She is endowed
with three powers: She has three powers of

22:30.123 --> 22:35.383
God which are granted to Her.

22:35.383 --> 22:39.233
By one power, first of all, is the existence,
the desire to exist, She desires to exist

22:39.233 --> 22:41.453
with God.

22:41.453 --> 22:53.413
The second power is to create and the third
power is to sustain.

22:53.413 --> 23:04.383
First power is existence, second is to create
and the third is the evolving power or sustenance

23:04.383 --> 23:08.433
power by which gradually you sustain something
and you become something.

23:08.433 --> 23:12.363
These are the three powers She assumes.

23:12.363 --> 23:21.643
In short, we can say that She forms three
powers of Mahakali, Mahasaraswati and Mahalakshmi.

23:21.643 --> 23:26.313
These are the three powers She assumes within
Herself.

23:26.313 --> 23:29.643
Now, She uses again Her parabolic systems.

23:29.643 --> 23:35.593
You know, supposing, I have come to this house
by this way, I know this way.

23:35.593 --> 23:36.653
Then I take that way, I know that way.

23:36.653 --> 23:38.553
I know the middle way, everything.

23:38.553 --> 23:42.913
Now, I know these three ways and I know all
about it: with that knowledge, I can do something

23:42.913 --> 23:43.913
else.

23:43.913 --> 23:49.173
So, She again uses Her parabolic movements.

23:49.173 --> 23:56.754
Actually, Her three movements, of Mahakali,
Mahalakshmi and Mahasaraswati, are all the

23:56.754 --> 24:00.403
time with Her, with the Adi Shakti.

24:00.403 --> 24:04.843
She can separate them and put them into three
different channels.

24:04.843 --> 24:09.643
She can combine them and synthesise them and
use it as a parabola – you understand this?

24:09.643 --> 24:15.153
That’s why when we put a bandhan to you,
we say “put a parabola,” is a parabola,

24:15.153 --> 24:18.213
because the vibrations are all in… all the
three powers are flowing this way.

24:18.213 --> 24:28.613
So, we have got, you know that, three powers
– the Mahakali power you can say, I need

24:28.613 --> 24:29.613
not write, “Mahakali power”.

24:29.613 --> 24:34.343
By Mahakali power She desires, as I’ve told
you, is the emotional side of God, you can

24:34.343 --> 24:35.343
say.

24:35.343 --> 24:38.223
She represents the emotional side of God,
She desires.

24:38.223 --> 24:41.263
Is the desire is that of God.

24:41.263 --> 24:45.663
God Almighty, Who is the spectator, He is
the Sakshi.

24:45.663 --> 24:50.743
And She puts that Sakshi into your heart,
She reflects that into your heart which is

24:50.743 --> 24:55.663
kept all the time burning to watch what you
are doing.

24:55.663 --> 25:01.043
To see your play after your creation.

25:01.043 --> 25:08.203
Her Mahasaraswati power, now, moves in a parabola.

25:08.203 --> 25:23.633
She can move in any angle, 360 angles She
can move, from one point.

25:23.633 --> 25:29.273
Sometimes, She goes round and round at a point.

25:29.273 --> 25:40.913
When She goes round and round at a point,
Her Mahasaraswati power can get consolidated;

25:40.913 --> 25:43.503
you can say, it becomes dense.

25:43.503 --> 25:48.853
You see, that’s the trouble with English
language!

25:48.853 --> 26:03.093
It becomes dense, it becomes so very dense
that it cracks out.

26:03.093 --> 26:09.773
These cracks occur due to the momentum of
the movement of the Mahakali power, Mahasaraswati

26:09.773 --> 26:10.773
power.

26:10.773 --> 26:16.043
Because it is moving in a round and round
fashion, they also get into the momentum of

26:16.043 --> 26:17.893
that movement, they start moving.

26:17.893 --> 26:21.813
For example, this part starts moving, this
part starts moving, this part starts moving.

26:21.813 --> 26:27.913
And when they start moving, they become rounds,
they lose their angularities and then they

26:27.913 --> 26:29.043
become round.

26:29.043 --> 26:36.393
Now I’m telling you, very much in short
because it’s a…they become round.

26:36.393 --> 26:40.573
These rounds again are put into friction with
each other.

26:40.573 --> 26:44.543
And that is how, we can say – now forget
about other universes, where other styles

26:44.543 --> 26:47.673
were also created – but about this one we
can say, was created.

26:47.673 --> 26:53.793
Now, you must all the time remember that this
Power thinks, understands, organises, loves

26:53.793 --> 26:56.903
and is an identity.

26:56.903 --> 26:59.103
So, She creates the Earth.

26:59.103 --> 27:01.593
Earth is not created so easily.

27:01.593 --> 27:10.983
Part of the Sun is removed just like this,
with the hand, you can say.

27:10.983 --> 27:14.363
We must understand why the Sun became so cold.

27:14.363 --> 27:22.733
Sun is, from the Sun it is removed very much
far away first, to the farthest point so that

27:22.733 --> 27:23.813
it freezes completely.

27:23.813 --> 27:28.253
Also like Moon, it was taken very far away.

27:28.253 --> 27:33.303
It just freezes completely and is then brought
near the Sun again, like a pendulum.

27:33.303 --> 27:39.153
It is moved again towards the cold side, again
it is brought to the hot side.

27:39.153 --> 27:46.283
It is brought to a point, to the medium point
where Earth is made, is made – again I’m

27:46.283 --> 27:51.153
saying, it’s not a chance of nature – is
made deliberately, habitable for human beings,

27:51.153 --> 27:52.913
the temperature was brought in.

27:52.913 --> 27:59.373
It has been done by Adi Shakti, the Mother.

27:59.373 --> 28:05.263
She has done it deliberately, it’s not easy
to conceive of such a Mother.

28:05.263 --> 28:07.013
But She has done it.

28:07.013 --> 28:12.523
And She brings this Earth to a point where
life can begin.

28:12.523 --> 28:21.713
So the combination of Moon and the combination
of Sun gives you hydrogen from the Moon, oxygen

28:21.713 --> 28:26.573
from the sun, gives you water, the freezing
and heating.

28:26.573 --> 28:30.713
The freezing and heating gives you the water.

28:30.713 --> 28:36.973
In the water, when the Earth is made, spirally,
to move upward, again the heating and cooling

28:36.973 --> 28:37.973
starts.

28:37.973 --> 28:48.693
By heating and cooling, life comes into being
as amino-acids.

28:48.693 --> 28:49.693
Is done deliberately!

28:49.693 --> 28:53.713
What I am saying: it is not done by something,
by chance.

28:53.713 --> 28:56.463
On this also one has to think once: “How
is it?”

28:56.463 --> 28:57.463
It is not chance!

28:57.463 --> 29:03.218
If you read Du Nouy [Pierre Lecomte Du Nouy
(1883-1947)] , is a very big biologist, I

29:03.218 --> 29:06.843
mean, I think he’s one of the greatest biologists
who has really gone into the calculations

29:06.843 --> 29:22.193
of how much time should it take for a simple
amoeba to be created out of the matter and

29:22.193 --> 29:27.092
he has calculated that it should take much
more time than even what we have had so far

29:27.092 --> 29:31.403
– billions of billions of years are needed
just by chance.

29:31.403 --> 29:35.933
Law of chance is there, which I don’t know
if I should tell you elaborately, but law

29:35.933 --> 29:44.993
of chance is that, if you have in one tube
50 red pebbles and 50 white pebbles and if

29:44.993 --> 29:51.943
you start shaking them and make them absolutely
in a chaotic order, it takes so much, so much

29:51.943 --> 29:58.693
times shaking to make it again the same as
it is, or to bring it into order.

29:58.693 --> 30:09.923
So, even to create an orderly living protoplasm,
a cell, would have taken much more time than

30:09.923 --> 30:14.353
it has taken so far: much more, many times
more, billions of billions.

30:14.353 --> 30:20.223
And it has taken only 5 billion years for
Earth to secede from the Moon.

30:20.223 --> 30:23.443
And only 2 billion years for it to cool down.

30:23.443 --> 30:29.153
So, he says, it is beyond any understanding
– only thing that can explain it, what we

30:29.153 --> 30:31.263
can say, is that there is a ‘Juggler’
behind it.

30:31.263 --> 30:36.383
And there is a Juggler, about which our great
rishis and munis know that – that Juggler

30:36.383 --> 30:40.133
is nobody else but Adi Shakti, the Primordial
Mother.

30:40.133 --> 30:43.943
The Primordial Father is Sadashiva and the
Primordial Mother is Adi Shakti.

30:43.943 --> 30:47.443
And are we going to discuss about their sex?

30:47.443 --> 30:51.853
Are we going to do that way with the tantrikas?

30:51.853 --> 30:57.093
Is that the way to pay homage to your parents?

30:57.093 --> 31:01.973
We have to understand that it’s a very,
very solemn subject, we are discussing here

31:01.973 --> 31:06.583
the sanctum sanctorium of the love of our
Primordial Parents.

31:06.583 --> 31:08.243
It’s a very, very holy thing.

31:08.243 --> 31:15.253
We are not holy people, we are yet full of
lots of greed and lust, but they are above

31:15.253 --> 31:16.253
everything.

31:16.253 --> 31:19.783
So, when we are discussing them, we have to
know, we have to do it with great shraddha,

31:19.783 --> 31:26.963
and with our head bowed before them that it
is our luck and we are very fortunate that

31:26.963 --> 31:34.033
we have been able to learn something about
these two Primordial Parents who have brought

31:34.033 --> 31:40.143
forth this Creation, their child.

31:40.143 --> 31:50.943
So, one of these then again cracks and becomes
a surya-mandal, and a surya-mandala has got,

31:50.943 --> 31:58.583
as you know, Earth and Moon and all these
things and I have told you how Earth is created.

31:58.583 --> 32:08.673
After the Creation of Earth, first, you know
that amino-acids were formed, the vegetation

32:08.673 --> 32:12.123
started and then the human being started.

32:12.123 --> 32:16.653
Now, the matter, also, is a very systematic
thing.

32:16.653 --> 32:20.933
Matter is not unsystematic, it is systematic,
but it is not organised – there is difference

32:20.933 --> 32:22.104
between the two.

32:22.104 --> 32:24.633
The systematic things are dead, can be dead.

32:24.633 --> 32:31.583
You can put five stones here in a systematic
manner, but they are not organised, because

32:31.583 --> 32:32.643
they are not living things.

32:32.643 --> 32:34.493
There’s a difference between the two.

32:34.493 --> 32:37.653
So, first, the systematic things were laid
down.

32:37.653 --> 32:47.413
Perhaps, if you know about the…Eight different
types of elements were created.

32:47.413 --> 32:56.083
These were created and were put into proper
places through Shri Ganesha.

32:56.083 --> 33:08.913
You know that the carbon… carbon is in the
centre of these periodical elements that appear.

33:08.913 --> 33:16.453
That means a element which has got one valency,
two valency, three valency and four valency,

33:16.453 --> 33:21.543
the three are the plus ones, then you’ve
got one C, carbon, which has got four valences.

33:21.543 --> 33:30.093
Then you have got, again, minus one, two,
three and four – is a complete eight.

33:30.093 --> 33:37.263
Like that, the whole matter has been organised.

33:37.263 --> 33:44.493
To organise the matter, some deity was to
be created for that, and first deity that

33:44.493 --> 33:47.263
was created was that of Shri Ganesh.

33:47.263 --> 33:56.803
Let us see now how She created here.

33:56.803 --> 34:06.593
You have seen that one part of Her, which
is the Mahasaraswati, has created the matter.

34:06.593 --> 34:10.843
Mahasaraswati has created the matter.

34:10.843 --> 34:14.643
Now, Mahakali has to give them existence.

34:14.643 --> 34:16.213
How do you get an existence?

34:16.213 --> 34:20.753
Is through your sustenance or, you can say,
through your quality – whatever you are.

34:20.753 --> 34:29.673
So, Mahakali gives that existence to those
material things, not human beings or living

34:29.673 --> 34:44.063
things but matter, through a deity known as
Shri Ganesh.

34:44.063 --> 34:49.953
Mahakali…

34:49.953 --> 34:54.253
In the heart of the Viraata, as you see, – you’ll
see Viraata also He comes in, because that

34:54.253 --> 34:59.863
I will tell you later on – but in the heart
of Viraata, is the Primordial Being, the complete

34:59.863 --> 35:02.972
Primordial Being, the Mahakali is settled
down.

35:02.972 --> 35:08.703
What She does, She goes three and a half from
the heart: one up, one down like that – three

35:08.703 --> 35:13.173
and a half times and comes to the end of the
three and a half, down-way.

35:13.173 --> 35:15.373
Three and a half.

35:15.373 --> 35:17.693
Now, She comes at the end of it.

35:17.693 --> 35:22.753
And if you put three and a half like that
and if you cut it straight, you get 7 centres

35:22.753 --> 35:24.123
cut in.

35:24.123 --> 35:36.883
Is there a drawing person who knows how to
draw?

35:36.883 --> 35:51.043
You should start from like that, you can put
it like this.

35:51.043 --> 35:56.213
She comes down here.

35:56.213 --> 36:02.393
She comes down here and from here She penetrates.

36:02.393 --> 36:07.103
You see, She cuts at seven points here.

36:07.103 --> 36:13.383
At this point, She creates the first deity,
little below, of Shri Ganesh.

36:13.383 --> 36:18.003
I mean, this is not done in one day, is not
done in one year, not done in one Yuga, it

36:18.003 --> 36:19.583
is done in many Kalpas.

36:19.583 --> 36:27.763
The first step is to create Shri Ganesh, this
is Her abode and She puts Shri Ganesh.

36:27.763 --> 36:32.613
Now, he is emitting his vibrations through
all this.

36:32.613 --> 36:36.883
He passes through all this whatever She has
created.

36:36.883 --> 36:42.713
On this picture is settled the work of the
Mahasaraswati, you can say.

36:42.713 --> 36:47.282
She comes down with all Her programs like
this and She makes it.

36:47.282 --> 36:48.782
And She gets joined here again.

36:48.782 --> 36:52.453
So, Shri Ganesh emits His vibrations through
her.

36:52.453 --> 36:57.783
First, Shri Mahakali creates Shri Ganesh and
then Mahasaraswati comes down, She creates

36:57.783 --> 37:01.233
all these things and gets connected to Shri
Ganesh.

37:01.233 --> 37:08.403
So, the vibrations of Shri Ganesh start flowing
through all the creation of Mahasaraswati.

37:08.403 --> 37:17.383
Before creating all this, the complete thought
of what is going to happen in future comes

37:17.383 --> 37:21.823
in a clear-cut vision of the Adi Shakti.

37:21.823 --> 37:23.553
And She puts Her plans through.

37:23.553 --> 37:28.933
First of all, the Mahalakshmi power comes
down and creates the Shri Ganesh.

37:28.933 --> 37:34.023
You can understand now how important it is
that we have to be holy people.

37:34.023 --> 37:37.423
First, She created the holiness on this Earth.

37:37.423 --> 37:41.833
First thing, Her relationship with the child
was established, because the Creation is going

37:41.833 --> 37:45.413
to be created in the image of Her child.

37:45.413 --> 37:51.893
That’s why Shri Ganesh was created first.

37:51.893 --> 37:57.282
And then from here, say, is the Adi Shakti,
the other power, Mahasaraswati, on Her way,

37:57.282 --> 38:00.333
She comes down and gets connected with Shri
Ganesh.

38:00.333 --> 38:05.473
And that’s how the Shri Ganesh establishes
the relationship and emits His vibrations

38:05.473 --> 38:06.473
through this.

38:06.473 --> 38:10.403
Because of His vibrations passing through
the matter that She has created.

38:10.403 --> 38:16.443
For example, our Mother Earth: through this
passes the, you know that through it passes

38:16.443 --> 38:17.443
the axis.

38:17.443 --> 38:21.933
Nobody has seen the axis, but they say, there
is an axis, from the way it moves.

38:21.933 --> 38:23.383
There is a kind of an axis.

38:23.383 --> 38:30.683
Now, this is the power of Mahakali passing
through the [axis].

38:30.683 --> 38:35.053
We can say, it’s the power of Shri Ganesh
passing through the axis of the Mother Earth,

38:35.053 --> 38:37.603
which has got magnetic power in it.

38:37.603 --> 38:44.043
And that’s how, through that, it controls
its speed, its movement, and also it looks

38:44.043 --> 38:45.043
after us.

38:45.043 --> 38:51.393
Why don’t we think that when we put a little
seed in the soil it sprouts, automatically?

38:51.393 --> 38:56.753
You have seen now, many of you who have been
suffering from certain troubles and diseases,

38:56.753 --> 39:00.453
that the Mother Earth herself took down your
problems, She sucked them out.

39:00.453 --> 39:07.413
It is a fact, you can see it in Sahaja Yoga,
that after realisation if you have any problem,

39:07.413 --> 39:11.853
if your head is heavy, if you are a realised
soul, otherwise She doesn’t listen, because

39:11.853 --> 39:17.823
you should be activated or you should be granted
a certificate from the Adi Shakti that you’re

39:17.823 --> 39:20.953
a realised person, otherwise why should She
accept you?

39:20.953 --> 39:28.323
You just put your head on the soil, put your
both the hands on the Mother Earth and you’ll

39:28.323 --> 39:30.903
find the whole thing will be sucked out from
your forehead.

39:30.903 --> 39:35.603
It has been done with many, even from the
legs it can take out.

39:35.603 --> 39:40.473
Mother Earth is actually, is the Mother of
Adi Shakti, you can say.

39:40.473 --> 39:46.324
She is the Mother, they say, because She is
made in such a way that She takes all the

39:46.324 --> 39:49.003
weights of the world in Herself.

39:49.003 --> 39:52.624
She controls all the weights of the world
and She can consume all your weight.

39:52.624 --> 39:53.624
She’s the dharaa.

39:53.624 --> 39:58.703
Now, weight means everything that… your
weight is what we weigh in: that’s not the

39:58.703 --> 39:59.703
thing.

39:59.703 --> 40:02.403
Weight means also your sins, also your punyas.

40:02.403 --> 40:03.403
It means everything.

40:03.403 --> 40:07.513
If you have too many sins in you, then Mother
Earth feels hurt.

40:07.513 --> 40:13.393
Wherever there is too much of sin, then Mother
Earth has to ask help.

40:13.393 --> 40:19.203
And then some other deity has to, like Vishnu
himself, has to come on this Earth to save

40:19.203 --> 40:22.833
Her from this too much of overloading of sins
upon this Earth.

40:22.833 --> 40:23.833
Is a fact!

40:23.833 --> 40:26.013
It is not I’m telling you a mythical story,
is a fact.

40:26.013 --> 40:28.583
Which you have to verify after getting vibrations.

40:28.583 --> 40:31.913
Before getting vibrations, you cannot find
out from the Mother Earth.

40:31.913 --> 40:35.243
If you want to find out some time, if you
are realised, you just stand on the Mother

40:35.243 --> 40:38.223
Earth and ask her “Will you take away my
sins, oh Mother Earth?

40:38.223 --> 40:39.893
Will you take away my karmas?

40:39.893 --> 40:41.133
I have been realised."

40:41.133 --> 40:42.673
Immediately, She’ll start drawing you.

40:42.673 --> 40:43.673
You’ll be surprised.

40:43.673 --> 40:45.013
You’ll feel so much lighter.

40:45.013 --> 40:46.203
You have to use Her.

40:46.203 --> 40:49.683
That is how Mother Earth has been created.

40:49.683 --> 40:56.933
But also Adi Shakti through Her Mahasaraswati
power has created the five elements.

40:56.933 --> 41:00.743
Before everything else, She created tanmatra
(subtle elements) as you call it, I mean,

41:00.743 --> 41:03.513
if I go into details, it’s going to be too
much for you!

41:03.513 --> 41:05.772
But first of all, the causal essences were
created by Her.

41:05.772 --> 41:07.903
But if I say like this, there won’t be anything
false.

41:07.903 --> 41:16.373
If I say that just by seeing by Her sight,
by her drushti (sight), She has created this

41:16.373 --> 41:18.353
light.

41:18.353 --> 41:24.853
Just by Her breathing, She has created air,
because Her desire is the last point.

41:24.853 --> 41:28.013
Because She desired there should be air, She
created air.

41:28.013 --> 41:34.533
Like that, She has, Her smell has created
the causal, gandha, which has created this

41:34.533 --> 41:35.613
mother Earth.

41:35.613 --> 41:41.823
And it has started from Her only, from Her
desires, by Her desiring it – it was created

41:41.823 --> 41:46.593
for Her and that’s how it was created in
the whole Universe, which was later on made

41:46.593 --> 41:51.013
into Earth, Moon, Sun and all these things.

41:51.013 --> 41:53.223
Actually, it was Her mere desire which brought
forth these.

41:53.223 --> 41:58.283
For us it is impossible to understand someone
like that, who, just by mere desire can create.

41:58.283 --> 42:03.543
But when we think of somebody who is above
all the powers of the world, the One the,

42:03.543 --> 42:06.753
who is the highest of all: She can do anything
She feels like.

42:06.753 --> 42:08.403
Can’t we think like that?

42:08.403 --> 42:10.223
We cannot think of someone like that.

42:10.223 --> 42:13.983
We think of God, who is Almighty, we call
Him, but when we talk of His mights we start

42:13.983 --> 42:14.983
laughing.

42:14.983 --> 42:15.983
How can it be?

42:15.983 --> 42:16.983
But She can do anything She wants to.

42:16.983 --> 42:21.883
It is only Her mere desire that has brought
forth all these creations and all this things

42:21.883 --> 42:24.933
that you see in this world are created only
by Her desire.

42:24.933 --> 42:26.493
She created akasha.

42:26.493 --> 42:31.853
She created all these five elements, which
you know, and then She started Her another

42:31.853 --> 42:35.093
form which we call as the Mahalakshmi form.

42:35.093 --> 42:40.593
Before that, I think, I should tell you about
Shri Ganesha’s existence in the matter.

42:40.593 --> 42:44.813
He acts in the matter as vibrations, as Mahasaraswati
vibrations.

42:44.813 --> 42:49.973
They are electromagnetic vibrations, Mahasaraswati
vibrations are electromagnetic vibrations,

42:49.973 --> 42:55.273
we can say, that electromagnetic and also
there is sound, and all these five elements

42:55.273 --> 42:56.353
are expressed in that.

42:56.353 --> 43:06.253
You can record them – because if you take
a sulphur dioxide, for example, a sulphur

43:06.253 --> 43:12.032
dioxide and two oxygen and one sulphur and
if you watch them properly under a very highly

43:12.032 --> 43:17.483
micro – you can try, I don’t know if people
have tried, but you can try to find out – and

43:17.483 --> 43:24.823
put it under, let’s say, a very highly developed
micro – microwave- microscope, you can say,

43:24.823 --> 43:32.333
you can see that the oxygen things and sulphur,
– sulphur is stationary, – but these two

43:32.333 --> 43:33.333
are vibrating.

43:33.333 --> 43:36.783
They are vibrating, there’s a vibration
going between these bonds.

43:36.783 --> 43:42.473
They can be isometric also, they can be symmetric,
they can be even, uneven and they can be expanding,

43:42.473 --> 43:43.743
and closing like that.

43:43.743 --> 43:46.943
So, there are three types of vibrations, we
find.

43:46.943 --> 43:50.014
And the fourth side is nothing but Shri Ganesha
himself who is controlling.

43:50.014 --> 43:54.603
So, this we can see with our naked eyes, if
you want to see, even if you are realised

43:54.603 --> 43:55.603
or not.

43:55.603 --> 43:59.633
From where do these vibrations come in the
minutest paramanu, as you call, the molecules?

43:59.633 --> 44:05.643
In a molecule, how do you get these vibrations,
can you explain this?

44:05.643 --> 44:08.883
It is so much, sukshma, parasukshma.

44:08.883 --> 44:16.293
The powers of Ganesha are very, very subtle
and they enter into the matter and create

44:16.293 --> 44:23.233
this kind of vibrations, which you can even
see and record, electromagnetic vibrations,

44:23.233 --> 44:30.133
in, even, a one small, little molecule.

44:30.133 --> 44:37.463
So, we have in these, as I told you, into
the periodic level, periodic laws of elements,

44:37.463 --> 44:40.553
you can find out that all the elements are
divided into eight types.

44:40.553 --> 44:41.813
Just see!

44:41.813 --> 44:46.143
How can all the elements be divided into eight
parts without somebody being there?

44:46.143 --> 44:52.093
Can you do something without organising a
proper chart of these elements?

44:52.093 --> 44:54.933
Just think about it!

44:54.933 --> 44:57.703
You see, when we challenge God, we have to
understand that in this world everything is

44:57.703 --> 45:03.103
so well organised, there are eight elements
spread out so well, placed so well.

45:03.103 --> 45:08.463
And it has a particular style of behaviour
and every element is different in numbers

45:08.463 --> 45:15.773
and protons and these numbers are very well
calculated in such a manner that the end of

45:15.773 --> 45:22.553
it, that the last circle, that the last circle
of all the protons should be eight.

45:22.553 --> 45:28.793
If it is not eight, if it is less than eight
then it creates a valency problem.

45:28.793 --> 45:32.483
It is so well organised, then, even if you
study this, if there is anybody who knows

45:32.483 --> 45:36.203
little bit of chemistry, you know, so if you
know chemistry, it’s such a wonderful thing.

45:36.203 --> 45:37.203
We take it for granted!

45:37.203 --> 45:40.282
We think it is our right to have the matter
so well organised for us!

45:40.282 --> 45:45.423
But the valencies are all depending on such
a nice organisation of this eight protons

45:45.423 --> 45:47.863
at the outer thing.

45:47.863 --> 45:49.433
This is all done through the Mahasaraswati
power.

45:49.433 --> 45:55.313
But the vibrating force…Now see, there is
a vibrating force: this is all done through

45:55.313 --> 45:57.683
the, as I told you, through the Mahasaraswati
power.

45:57.683 --> 45:59.272
She creates.

45:59.272 --> 46:02.703
Now the vibrating force: He exists, matter
also exists.

46:02.703 --> 46:03.703
It must exist.

46:03.703 --> 46:05.543
If it does not exist, nothing can exist.

46:05.543 --> 46:12.973
So, the existence force is given through the
Mahakali force, which is acting through Shri

46:12.973 --> 46:16.333
Ganesh, who is sitting at the nucleus.

46:16.333 --> 46:20.633
He is sitting at the nucleus of every [atom].

46:20.633 --> 46:25.323
Can you imagine how much it must be?

46:25.323 --> 46:28.993
Every molecule and every atom.

46:28.993 --> 46:30.863
You cannot understand the finiteness of it.

46:30.863 --> 46:34.453
Now, see, say, take one element like gold,
how many molecules it has?

46:34.453 --> 46:35.483
Can you calculate?

46:35.483 --> 46:36.983
[It’s] beyond us!

46:36.983 --> 46:40.353
How many, you can say, atoms it has?

46:40.353 --> 46:42.633
We just cannot calculate it.

46:42.633 --> 46:45.983
And then how many Ganesha’s pictures must
be there?

46:45.983 --> 46:47.713
How is it achieved?

46:47.713 --> 46:53.903
Is another thing which I will tell you if
I come in the way.

46:53.903 --> 47:02.153
How infinite reflections are caught into and
why there are two things like Shiva and Adi

47:02.153 --> 47:03.153
Shakti?

47:03.153 --> 47:06.653
The reason is it has to create an infinite
reflection.

47:06.653 --> 47:08.913
How do you create an infinite reflection?

47:08.913 --> 47:10.923
Do you know that?

47:10.923 --> 47:17.163
Anybody who knows physics?

47:17.163 --> 47:21.833
If you place in the centre of two mirrors
something, then the reflections are infinite.

47:21.833 --> 47:32.643
So, the first mirror is the Adi Shakti and
the second mirror is this Creation, and that’s

47:32.643 --> 47:38.693
how you can get infinite reflections on this
Earth.

47:38.693 --> 47:41.303
This is the reason why you can get infinite
reflections.

47:41.303 --> 47:49.203
And that’s why you had to create another
one who reflects it.

47:49.203 --> 47:54.653
And that’s why there have to be three identities,
one, the God Almighty, then Adi Shakti and

47:54.653 --> 47:56.133
then the whole Universe.

47:56.133 --> 48:00.313
It had to be that way, otherwise you cannot
create infinite reflections.

48:00.313 --> 48:05.343
Now, somebody who has done this job must be
a very clever man, no doubt.

48:05.343 --> 48:10.073
When human beings think that they can know
God through their buddhi, they must know,

48:10.073 --> 48:13.573
how can you reach this Buddhi, it’s supreme.

48:13.573 --> 48:18.493
How much labour He has taken to create us!

48:18.493 --> 48:28.493
After creating the matter, then He, or I should
say, His power as Mahalakshmi descends on

48:28.493 --> 48:30.553
this Earth.

48:30.553 --> 48:34.693
Mahalakshmi helps in sustenance.

48:34.693 --> 48:39.233
Sustenance means all the scanning of all these
elements.

48:39.233 --> 48:47.743
When they create the matter, the matter is
differently created, created for different

48:47.743 --> 48:49.113
purposes.

48:49.113 --> 48:54.693
Now, what is the ultimate?

48:54.693 --> 49:00.613
The Creation has its ultimate aim is to create
human beings – this creation, just imagine!

49:00.613 --> 49:06.483
You people are so great that for you all these
troubles have been taken.

49:06.483 --> 49:12.043
Such an important thing is a human being that
all these troubles are taken, – all matter,

49:12.043 --> 49:17.183
all, everything, is used just to create you.

49:17.183 --> 49:18.183
This is the ultimate aim.

49:18.183 --> 49:24.233
Sort of a stage has to be laid down and you
come, the Sahaja Yogis come on the scene,

49:24.233 --> 49:26.532
you can say.

49:26.532 --> 49:28.663
Just the instrument of man is to be created.

49:28.663 --> 49:32.573
Now, why God wanted to create an instrument
of man?

49:32.573 --> 49:41.173
Because He wanted to create an instrument
which could feel Him, which could understand

49:41.173 --> 49:48.103
Him, which could emit, like Krishna creating
his murli (flute).

49:48.103 --> 49:52.663
He just wanted to play through our instruments
His power.

49:52.663 --> 49:58.253
But He didn’t want to do it through the
dead instruments like these but through the

49:58.253 --> 49:59.253
living instruments.

49:59.253 --> 50:06.373
Supposing, if this (microphone) can understand,
can love, has a human mind, and if my voice

50:06.373 --> 50:14.863
is passing through it like a hollow personality
then we can say that this is a realised personality.

50:14.863 --> 50:17.613
But this is not a living being, you are a
living being.

50:17.613 --> 50:22.053
You are made specially with all these difficulties
for millions of years, have been worked out

50:22.053 --> 50:26.083
so carefully, so delicately, one after another.

50:26.083 --> 50:31.403
We have to now jump to the evolution part,
because you see, it’s a very long thing.

50:31.403 --> 50:33.663
Shri Mataji: Kiti wasle (Marathi: what time
is it?)

50:33.663 --> 50:34.923
Yogi: Saha wasle (six o’clock)

50:34.923 --> 50:40.113
So, now we have to come to the most important
part which is evolution, which we should understand,

50:40.113 --> 50:47.503
because we know evolution through science.

50:47.503 --> 50:56.613
When these three forces came into being, before
creating any earth or before creating this

50:56.613 --> 51:04.503
universe or anything, first they had to draw
out a proper picture about it and a proper

51:04.503 --> 51:05.873
understanding of it, you see.

51:05.873 --> 51:08.123
As before doing anything, say, we have to
plan out things, we have a planning commission,

51:08.123 --> 51:11.153
first of all, we sit down with a planning
commission.

51:11.153 --> 51:16.693
In the same way, first, they had to form a
stage where they just plan out the things.

51:16.693 --> 51:20.012
This stage we can call it as the vaikuntha
state.

51:20.012 --> 51:25.163
Because this (current stage) is not the earliest
state, this is created later on.

51:25.163 --> 51:34.963
First, the planning state is known as the
vaikuntha state.

51:34.963 --> 51:38.683
At this stage they created all the incarnations.

51:38.683 --> 51:44.153
Incarnations were not created after the Earth
has been created, which is a very wrong idea.

51:44.153 --> 51:47.683
They created all the incarnations at the vaikuntha
state.

51:47.683 --> 51:53.483
Where you or I never existed at that time,
this Earth never existed and nothing existed

51:53.483 --> 51:55.603
that you see with your naked eyes now.

51:55.603 --> 52:01.523
But a state of existence, the first one, known
as the vaikuntha state, existed.

52:01.523 --> 52:11.133
In that vaikuntha state the planning of the
whole Universe and the whole cosmos and all

52:11.133 --> 52:12.253
that was decided.

52:12.253 --> 52:19.953
So, the first person who had to come on this
was Shiva, because without him nothing can

52:19.953 --> 52:25.203
exist, but where to settle Him down, because
He is to be reflected onto something.

52:25.203 --> 52:29.823
If Shiva has to be reflected onto someone,
you have to create a reflector.

52:29.823 --> 52:40.253
So, they had to, first, think of the one Primordial
Being or a, one Huge Identity you can call

52:40.253 --> 52:41.883
it, known as Viraat.

52:41.883 --> 52:44.423
They created Viraata.

52:44.423 --> 52:50.133
This will be the Viraata, this will be the
complete form of the Primordial Being.

52:50.133 --> 52:54.623
This is the one I’m telling you about, this
Reflector, The First One.

52:54.623 --> 52:59.293
The God Almighty has to be reflected, so,
first, let us create, first of all, the Primordial

52:59.293 --> 53:01.803
Being, the Viraat.

53:01.803 --> 53:10.603
In the Viraat they created different incarnations.

53:10.603 --> 53:13.443
Incarnations are not created from human beings.

53:13.443 --> 53:15.853
I don’t know why people think like that.

53:15.853 --> 53:17.573
They cannot be created by human beings.

53:17.573 --> 53:18.613
But they were first created.

53:18.613 --> 53:23.743
You see, evolution is alright from amoeba
to human beings, but there is no evolution

53:23.743 --> 53:25.223
for incarnations.

53:25.223 --> 53:30.323
They are made like that from the very beginning.

53:30.323 --> 53:40.853
As you have seen in the Viraata, I have shown
you the picture of the Viraat, the three powers

53:40.853 --> 53:50.203
of Mahakali, Mahalakshmi and Mahasaraswati
met at the Agya Chakra, and there they produced

53:50.203 --> 53:58.723
two children each – it’s not a story,
is a fact, again – as brothers and sisters.

53:58.723 --> 54:08.243
And these brothers and sister means the relationship
is of a temporary nature but of a subtler

54:08.243 --> 54:09.243
temperament.

54:09.243 --> 54:15.383
And then they were married, inter-communication
took place.

54:15.383 --> 54:24.233
Mahalakshmi, Mahasaraswati and Mahakali created
all together six children, who were married.

54:24.233 --> 54:26.473
Inter-marriage took place.

54:26.473 --> 54:36.763
By that inter-marriage they got an entity
which was a kinetic personality and a potential

54:36.763 --> 54:40.353
energy within it, such a combination.

54:40.353 --> 54:44.103
And they placed those incarnations on different
chakras.

54:44.103 --> 54:51.643
They brought from these, from the top, all
of them were brought from the Agya downward

54:51.643 --> 54:55.723
and placed onto all the chakras.

54:55.723 --> 55:02.483
These incarnations, as you know, are placed
on different chakras of the Viraata.

55:02.483 --> 55:07.793
Many people won’t understand this and won’t
like to hear this also, because human beings

55:07.793 --> 55:14.503
are so egoistical that they cannot understand
that there is a God, Who is Almighty, Who

55:14.503 --> 55:18.843
is going to do everything, He has His own
ways of doing it.

55:18.843 --> 55:23.213
Now, whether I’m telling the Truth or not,
you can verify it on vibrations.

55:23.213 --> 55:26.883
You can see for yourself how Incarnations
were created.

55:26.883 --> 55:32.753
And all these Incarnations were placed in
the Viraata state.

55:32.753 --> 55:45.673
Here, to create the reflection on the other
side, Shiva was removed from the Shakti, as

55:45.673 --> 55:50.933
it was removed in the beginning and it was
placed on top of the Viraata’s head as the

55:50.933 --> 55:51.933
Sadashiva’s peetha.

55:51.933 --> 55:53.843
In the same way, we, too, have a Sadashiva’s
peetha on our head.

55:53.843 --> 55:56.073
You see, we are the reflection of the reflector.

55:56.073 --> 56:04.653
So, we, too, have the same style, we, too,
have a Sadahsiva’s peetha on our head.

56:04.653 --> 56:06.813
He’s also placed here only.

56:06.813 --> 56:18.282
But when the Kundalini enters into the being,
when he is in the womb of the mother, that

56:18.282 --> 56:25.073
time this Sadashiva peetha, or we can say,
Sadashiva from this peetha descends into the

56:25.073 --> 56:26.473
heart.

56:26.473 --> 56:32.333
And that’s how you hear the first throb
in the heart.

56:32.333 --> 56:35.483
It is just the same as it happened in the
Viraata.

56:35.483 --> 56:41.403
But at the vaikuntha stage this was not created,
the second reflector here was not created,

56:41.403 --> 56:42.963
only the first one.

56:42.963 --> 56:52.012
So, only the Viraata was created and in His
Being, in the planning stage, first of all,

56:52.012 --> 56:58.032
these officers, you can say, in charge of
these chakras were created by Adi Shakti.

56:58.032 --> 57:04.393
God is the witness and She is doing the play
and She creates those chakras.

57:04.393 --> 57:07.183
In the chakras She places all these deities
to govern.

57:07.183 --> 57:19.733
Now, there is the existence, there is the
creation, creative force, and there is the

57:19.733 --> 57:23.233
evolutionary force – all inside the Viraata
state.

57:23.233 --> 57:28.143
Now, this is at the vaikuntha state, we say,
because this state is on this first reflection.

57:28.143 --> 57:39.323
It is not in us, or we cannot feel it, the
vaikuntha state, because it is in the first

57:39.323 --> 57:40.323
thing.

57:40.323 --> 57:42.973
Then another state was created, then third
was created.

57:42.973 --> 57:48.023
But the fourth one is the bhavasagara, is
the state at which all of us were born.

57:48.023 --> 57:54.703
First, in the fourth state…now, can you
think of a four strata personality which is

57:54.703 --> 57:56.263
facing a mirror?

57:56.263 --> 57:59.463
Now, which is the first one [that] shows?

57:59.463 --> 58:00.463
Is the topmost.

58:00.463 --> 58:02.303
And that’s why the topmost shows is the
bhavasagara.

58:02.303 --> 58:07.673
But if you can go deep down into your state,
you can feel all the other three.

58:07.673 --> 58:10.283
But first of all, the one which you can see
and feel it, is the bhavasagara.

58:10.283 --> 58:12.303
So, you are born in the bhavasagara.

58:12.303 --> 58:15.093
At this state you are at the bhavasagara state.

58:15.093 --> 58:23.193
At this bhavasagara state, now, you are created
and you have to evolve.

58:23.193 --> 58:26.933
At this time the Mahalakshmi power acts to
evolve you.

58:26.933 --> 58:33.022
You already know how evolutionary things have
taken place but I will tell you how evolution

58:33.022 --> 58:36.532
has taken place according to our puranas (ancient
scriptures), and which is a fact.

58:36.532 --> 58:46.243
The Evolution of Man started, first from the
amoeba, you can say; because the life came

58:46.243 --> 58:49.163
into being into water, as I told you [that]
first the water was created.

58:49.163 --> 58:53.743
In the water the amino-acids were formed,
amoeba were formed, fishes were formed and

58:53.743 --> 59:00.893
fishes, when they were formed, they found,
the smaller fishes found it difficult to exist

59:00.893 --> 59:04.623
because of the bigger fishes were trying to
eat it.

59:04.623 --> 59:10.053
It comes as a reciprocal thing, they were
absolutely fed up of this destruction that

59:10.053 --> 59:11.113
was going on.

59:11.113 --> 59:16.793
At this time, Shri Vishnu Himself, the One
who is the evolutionary force, descended on

59:16.793 --> 59:20.543
this Earth as the Matsya-Avatara.

59:20.543 --> 59:24.323
He helped some of the fishes to cross across
the shores.

59:24.323 --> 59:29.123
By crossing across they had that courage,
She was the leader.

59:29.123 --> 59:30.523
And then others started crossing across.

59:30.523 --> 59:34.252
This was the first evolutionary stage which
we know.

59:34.252 --> 59:38.983
These fishes became reptiles later on; as
you know, in the evolutionary stages that

59:38.983 --> 59:41.323
they became reptiles.

59:41.323 --> 59:42.873
But how did they become reptiles?

59:42.873 --> 59:45.563
There must be someone who must have given
them the lead.

59:45.563 --> 59:51.613
It was again Shri Vishnu, who came on this
Earth as a Kurma and lots of things were done

59:51.613 --> 59:57.413
at this time in the vaikuntha stage, before
He came on this Earth as a Kurma Avatara.

59:57.413 --> 01:00:02.933
At the vaikuntha stage, when they created
this Earth, when they created, they planned

01:00:02.933 --> 01:00:08.653
this whole Viraata and wanted to create, on
this side of the reflector the whole planning

01:00:08.653 --> 01:00:14.573
and the whole thinking and all that process
brought forth some sort of a waste matter.

01:00:14.573 --> 01:00:17.813
It brought forth the waste matter.

01:00:17.813 --> 01:00:23.023
This waste matter got contaminated or, we
can say, got stagnated on to one side which

01:00:23.023 --> 01:00:28.195
was neglected somehow, and through it started
coming out some satanic forces and there was

01:00:28.195 --> 01:00:32.293
a big fight between the satanic forces and
the good forces.

01:00:32.293 --> 01:00:36.693
It actually happened in the third stage, not
at the vaikuntha stage, but at the third stage,

01:00:36.693 --> 01:00:40.083
because when the planning started, the working
out started, these satanic forces started

01:00:40.083 --> 01:00:41.083
working out.

01:00:41.083 --> 01:00:43.073
Now, people may say, “Why God created satanic
forces?”

01:00:43.073 --> 01:00:49.753
He did not, but eventually they turned out
to be because at the second stage, when some

01:00:49.753 --> 01:00:51.223
of the Devas, who were created.

01:00:51.223 --> 01:00:55.623
Again, they were not evolved people, they
were created, Devas, in charge of all these

01:00:55.623 --> 01:00:59.683
elements and all the working, you see, you
have to create also officers or people who

01:00:59.683 --> 01:01:01.423
have to go in the field and work out.

01:01:01.423 --> 01:01:05.703
All these Devas and Devatas: out of their
working, what happened [is] that they got

01:01:05.703 --> 01:01:08.373
lost, some of them, and became satanic forces.

01:01:08.373 --> 01:01:13.433
Sort of a waste-product came in, and with
that waste-product, satanic forces started

01:01:13.433 --> 01:01:20.453
and they acted in such a way that there was
a war during the Kurma-Avatara between Rakshasas

01:01:20.453 --> 01:01:21.813
and the Suras, as they call it.

01:01:21.813 --> 01:01:26.093
So, the good people who were in charge of
the elements, all the working in the office

01:01:26.093 --> 01:01:29.103
of God started fighting with the satanic forces.

01:01:29.103 --> 01:01:36.073
At that time, He Himself worked out this and
you know what happened in the amrut-mantan

01:01:36.073 --> 01:01:40.623
which took place, and this is, – people
don’t understand how can the amrut-mantan

01:01:40.623 --> 01:01:42.473
take place in the bhavasagara, – it did
not.

01:01:42.473 --> 01:01:47.843
It took place at a stage which is not bhavasagara.

01:01:47.843 --> 01:01:50.173
At the bhavasagara it did not take place.

01:01:50.173 --> 01:01:52.993
Now, we are at the bhavasagara state.

01:01:52.993 --> 01:01:56.736
At the bhavasagara state the same Kurma, the
same one took birth and came on this Earth

01:01:56.736 --> 01:02:00.603
and gave us a understanding how to become
a proper reptile.

01:02:00.603 --> 01:02:01.923
Like that we grew up.

01:02:01.923 --> 01:02:05.123
So, the whole thing will take too much time,
I need not go into that.

01:02:05.123 --> 01:02:07.373
But, ultimately, a human being was created.

01:02:07.373 --> 01:02:12.843
All this is done by Mahalakshmi power, which
has acted through Vishnu, which I have told

01:02:12.843 --> 01:02:20.673
you how evolution has taken place, how you
are made.

01:02:20.673 --> 01:02:22.853
Now, what is going to happen?

01:02:22.853 --> 01:02:25.413
You reach this point, up to this point, till
Christ came in.

01:02:25.413 --> 01:02:29.553
Christ was also an incarnation and his Mother
was nobody else but Radhaji Herself, the Mahalakshmi.

01:02:29.553 --> 01:02:33.043
And they brought forth up to this stage the
human beings.

01:02:33.043 --> 01:02:36.012
After this, now, what man has to become?

01:02:36.012 --> 01:02:44.083
– is to enter into a state where he becomes
nirvichar, means there is no more the consciousness

01:02:44.083 --> 01:02:47.423
of the bhavasagara, but you go little beyond
it.

01:02:47.423 --> 01:02:57.383
From this stage you dive into a state of Universal
Unconscious, as they call it, it’s nothing

01:02:57.383 --> 01:03:01.613
but the same power which exists here, which
is a synthesis of all the three powers, is

01:03:01.613 --> 01:03:03.613
the synthesis of all the three powers.

01:03:03.613 --> 01:03:05.073
That is the Adi Shakti’s power.

01:03:05.073 --> 01:03:09.883
Adi Shakti’s power is all-pervading, exists
everywhere, but we never feel it otherwise.

01:03:09.883 --> 01:03:10.883
Why?

01:03:10.883 --> 01:03:12.293
Because we are very grossly placed.

01:03:12.293 --> 01:03:18.083
We can say, that a tube, which has got, say
four layers, out of which it can only use

01:03:18.083 --> 01:03:22.423
the outer tube, because the inner tubes are
all closed.

01:03:22.423 --> 01:03:27.522
When the innermost tube is opened out, you
become absolutely Self-realised, but when

01:03:27.522 --> 01:03:31.933
even the second tube is opened out, you can
feel the all-pervading force of God Almighty,

01:03:31.933 --> 01:03:36.073
which is, we call it as Sampovapi achetan.

01:03:36.073 --> 01:03:40.522
But it is no more achetan (unconscious) for
you because you are conscious of it.

01:03:40.522 --> 01:03:43.022
That is how you start your dialogue with God.

01:03:43.022 --> 01:03:48.022
What happens is that here, the reflection
here, the reflector, that is reflecting work,

01:03:48.022 --> 01:03:50.603
from here you ascend into this part.

01:03:50.603 --> 01:03:53.193
You ascend onto this part.

01:03:53.193 --> 01:03:57.733
You do not become this but you ascend into
this area.

01:03:57.733 --> 01:04:00.313
From here you ascend into this area.

01:04:00.313 --> 01:04:07.183
And this area is filled with the all-pervading
power of Adi Shakti.

01:04:07.183 --> 01:04:12.893
Till you reach to this stage, you have to
go up to this stage of an incarnation, which,

01:04:12.893 --> 01:04:14.423
of course, is a big gap.

01:04:14.423 --> 01:04:20.183
But I can say that Mahavira and Buddha, both
of them rose to that height.

01:04:20.183 --> 01:04:21.243
But look at their disciples!

01:04:21.243 --> 01:04:25.073
For example, Buddha’s disciples, they have
decried Shiva, they have decried all the Gods

01:04:25.073 --> 01:04:27.583
and Goddesses, I mean as if they did not know
much about it.

01:04:27.583 --> 01:04:33.793
And the way they have shown in certain statues
– that a Goddess is standing on top of a

01:04:33.793 --> 01:04:37.923
Shiva and a Parvati and is trying to kill;
She is hitting Shri Ganesha and this is something

01:04:37.923 --> 01:04:38.923
so non-sensical.

01:04:38.923 --> 01:04:44.333
I mean, they completely killed the image of
One United Force, acting the whole thing,

01:04:44.333 --> 01:04:46.693
in One united idea, with One united mind.

01:04:46.693 --> 01:04:51.643
Only whenever they had not united, they became
Rakshasas and formed the satanic force.

01:04:51.643 --> 01:04:55.963
As I told you it’s a very, very difficult
subject and I’ve tried to handle it in English,

01:04:55.963 --> 01:04:56.963
is even worse.

01:04:56.963 --> 01:05:01.413
So, I’ve tried my level best to do it, but
still if you have any questions, anything,

01:05:01.413 --> 01:05:05.083
you can ask me, some time, you can write to
me, we can find it out.

01:05:05.083 --> 01:05:08.863
For tomorrow…Now, this is the only thing
is, I wanted to tell you about this, that

01:05:08.863 --> 01:05:10.323
now you have got thoughtless awareness, no
doubt.

01:05:10.323 --> 01:05:14.413
Most of you have got thoughtless awareness,
you have got vibrations, but you have to jump

01:05:14.413 --> 01:05:15.413
into Nirvikalpa.

01:05:15.413 --> 01:05:16.413
Nirvikalpa.

01:05:16.413 --> 01:05:20.002
And [to] that you have to jump through deep
meditation and through deep exposure.

01:05:20.002 --> 01:05:24.823
Otherwise, you see, it is no use only having
this little state of Nirvichara, you have

01:05:24.823 --> 01:05:25.823
to jump into Nirvikalpa.

01:05:25.823 --> 01:05:30.823
That is a stage, little, as I’ve told you
here, that a little ahead of this reflector,

01:05:30.823 --> 01:05:31.823
you have moved.

01:05:31.823 --> 01:05:34.123
But still you are going up and down, so many
of you.

01:05:34.123 --> 01:05:38.734
This is a state known as satori in the Zen
system of religion, they call it as satori:

01:05:38.734 --> 01:05:41.123
where, you see, if a person is going up and
down, is catching, doing this, that.

01:05:41.123 --> 01:05:42.752
This stage has to be overcome.

01:05:42.752 --> 01:05:45.783
Then you go to the Nirvikalpa state.

01:05:45.783 --> 01:05:47.573
At the end of the Nirvikalpa state you just
don’t catch much.

01:05:47.573 --> 01:05:49.033
You are not bothered.

01:05:49.033 --> 01:05:52.593
So far, I haven’t met any human being like
that.

01:05:52.593 --> 01:05:59.183
You see, I have seen very great saints and
realised people and I can say that they are

01:05:59.183 --> 01:06:04.373
definitely Self-realised, they are even controlling
nature, some of them do, but still they catch

01:06:04.373 --> 01:06:06.553
on their chakras, is something surprising.

01:06:06.553 --> 01:06:11.473
But, you see, human beings are like that,
they’ll go on catching and again, perhaps,

01:06:11.473 --> 01:06:15.743
they jump into the third state of Self-realisation
completely, but they are again in a satori

01:06:15.743 --> 01:06:18.223
state and they come back and go back and,
like that, may be.

01:06:18.223 --> 01:06:22.913
But I have seen that, so far, I have not met
one human being whom I will say he is fully

01:06:22.913 --> 01:06:24.843
Self-realised, who doesn’t catch.

01:06:24.843 --> 01:06:29.003
Except for me, I find, everybody is catching.

01:06:29.003 --> 01:06:31.343
It’s most surprising.

01:06:31.343 --> 01:06:34.243
But when you don’t catch – what happens,
when you don’t catch?

01:06:34.243 --> 01:06:36.183
Actually, this is a state rather difficult
to achieve.

01:06:36.183 --> 01:06:42.403
But if you don’t catch, if you think you
don’t catch – how you should do it ?- is

01:06:42.403 --> 01:06:45.883
to see this way: that if, supposing, you are
catching Agya, maybe.

01:06:45.883 --> 01:06:49.853
You must know that when you are catching your
Agya, you should not think you are catching

01:06:49.853 --> 01:06:53.883
your Agya, but you should think that you are
gathering a force here to combat the another

01:06:53.883 --> 01:06:54.883
person.

01:06:54.883 --> 01:06:55.883
If you can do like that.

01:06:55.883 --> 01:07:00.593
Supposing you are catching on the Vishuddhi
chakra, instead of thinking that you are catching

01:07:00.593 --> 01:07:04.933
on Vishuddhi chakra and getting upset about
it, if you start thinking that this is a force

01:07:04.933 --> 01:07:07.903
you are accumulating just to counterbalance
his Vishuddhi chakra.

01:07:07.903 --> 01:07:10.883
Then, I think, it will work out better.

01:07:10.883 --> 01:07:15.373
That’s why I always say that: extend your
hands to others and see for yourself.

01:07:15.373 --> 01:07:19.022
This has helped many people because if they
catch on Agya and if they give vibrations

01:07:19.022 --> 01:07:20.453
to somebody who is Agya caught, they find
they are released.

01:07:20.453 --> 01:07:23.623
Such things are happening to very few but
it’s happening.

01:07:23.623 --> 01:07:27.363
So, this is what you can try: that don’t
think you are catching but you should think:

01:07:27.363 --> 01:07:31.553
a force has been accumulated to expel the
Agya of another person who is facing you.

01:07:31.553 --> 01:07:35.003
In the beginning, of course, it’s a very,
very slow process, but gradually you can do

01:07:35.003 --> 01:07:38.113
it and only people who start giving others.

01:07:38.113 --> 01:07:41.993
This is a collective thinking, is a collective
thinking: that, supposing, now you can say

01:07:41.993 --> 01:07:47.133
like that, that if, supposing, there is a
malaria attack on Me, then My own blood, My

01:07:47.133 --> 01:07:49.853
own blood cells are trying to combat it.

01:07:49.853 --> 01:07:50.893
And they are combating it.

01:07:50.893 --> 01:07:54.022
You see, if I give in, if I give in, then
I become malarious.

01:07:54.022 --> 01:07:55.843
But if I do not give in, I become victorious.

01:07:55.843 --> 01:08:01.993
In the same way, if you could think this way
while giving vibrations: that if you catch

01:08:01.993 --> 01:08:06.502
it is actually a force being accumulated into
you and then you have to give it, then you

01:08:06.502 --> 01:08:09.913
are going to be much faster than all the munis
put together, I can tell you.

01:08:09.913 --> 01:08:13.133
But that thinking is rather difficult for
human beings, because once they catch, they

01:08:13.133 --> 01:08:15.923
get little worried, “I’m catching,”
they start taking out their own.

01:08:15.923 --> 01:08:19.933
If you don’t take out your own and go all
out to give it to others, it will work out

01:08:19.933 --> 01:08:20.933
better.

01:08:20.933 --> 01:08:24.383
And this I’ve been, I’ve experimented
with one or two people, I’m saying, and

01:08:24.383 --> 01:08:25.383
it has worked.

01:08:25.383 --> 01:08:26.463
Everybody does not have that capacity.

01:08:26.463 --> 01:08:30.613
So, gradually you rise, because you are just
now newly born children, you have still to

01:08:30.613 --> 01:08:33.383
grow, you have to grow more.

01:08:33.383 --> 01:08:36.693
You might be learned, you might be knowing
a lot, that doesn’t mean, as far as your

01:08:36.693 --> 01:08:39.473
spirituality is concerned, you have just have
come out of your satori state, some of you,

01:08:39.473 --> 01:08:41.643
and some of you are still in the satori state.

01:08:41.643 --> 01:08:43.893
So, be careful about it.

01:08:43.893 --> 01:08:47.833
I would like to meet you again, perhaps, after
two years, I don’t know when.

01:08:47.833 --> 01:08:50.793
Tomorrow we are having a meditation here,
then I won’t speak much.

01:08:50.793 --> 01:08:52.223
Tomorrow we have a meditation.

01:08:52.223 --> 01:08:57.203
We have a meditation centre here, where you
should go and meet, when you meet in a group

01:08:57.203 --> 01:09:03.073
then it is a samuhik, is a group activity,
I will be there.

01:09:03.073 --> 01:09:08.793
You’ll be surprised that my vibrations cannot
be felt anywhere so much as they can be felt

01:09:08.793 --> 01:09:12.153
in a group, about which I know that such and
such group is working here.

01:09:12.153 --> 01:09:15.253
So, we have already three groups which are
working in Delhi.

01:09:15.253 --> 01:09:17.373
And they are made quite closer to the places.

01:09:17.373 --> 01:09:20.723
After all, we must know that we don’t have
to go to Himalayas, as people went down, we

01:09:20.723 --> 01:09:21.853
don’t have to do all these things.

01:09:21.853 --> 01:09:25.613
Only thing we have to go is to a place which
is very much closer to us, it has been brought

01:09:25.613 --> 01:09:26.983
to our doors.

01:09:26.983 --> 01:09:33.283
The whole thing has been brought to your doors:
the knowledge, the vibrations, the realisation

01:09:33.283 --> 01:09:34.593
and everything is made so easy.

01:09:34.593 --> 01:09:35.593
It’s made easy….

01:09:35.593 --> 01:09:38.272
But it should not mean that we should take
it for granted.

01:09:38.272 --> 01:09:43.002
It has been made easy through a very, very
great tapasya on my part, I should say.

01:09:43.002 --> 01:09:46.752
In many ages I’ve been living now for thousands
of years and I’ve been working it out on

01:09:46.752 --> 01:09:51.853
so many human beings and so many things and,
at long last, I’ve been able to find out

01:09:51.853 --> 01:09:55.493
most of the permutations and combinations
of most of the human beings and that’s how

01:09:55.493 --> 01:09:58.022
it has been worked out in such a large mass-scale.

01:09:58.022 --> 01:10:01.583
It would not have been possible if I had not
worked it out in that way.

01:10:01.583 --> 01:10:05.873
And that’s how if it has worked out it has
to click with most of the people except for

01:10:05.873 --> 01:10:12.123
one type is very, very difficult, I must say,
those who are bound to people who are rakshasas.

01:10:12.123 --> 01:10:15.482
If they are born rakshasas and if your head
has touched their feet, it’s a very difficult

01:10:15.482 --> 01:10:16.482
thing.

01:10:16.482 --> 01:10:18.652
So, I would warn you, that before you touch
feet of anybody, you’d be careful about

01:10:18.652 --> 01:10:19.652
it.

01:10:19.652 --> 01:10:20.652
May God bless you all!

01:10:20.652 --> 01:10:24.933
It’s already very late for all of you and
such a difficult subject to be brought to

01:10:24.933 --> 01:10:28.033
such a short time, it’s very difficult.

01:10:28.033 --> 01:10:32.693
I hope to write some book on Sahaja Yoga:
‘I hope’, I am saying, because, so far,

01:10:32.693 --> 01:10:33.772
I’ve never written any book.

01:10:33.772 --> 01:10:36.613
[I’m] trying to write some book, but before
that some other people are writing.

01:10:36.613 --> 01:10:39.583
I hope, I may be able to write something.

01:10:39.583 --> 01:10:43.103
In any case, you try not to bother too much
about these things.

01:10:43.103 --> 01:10:47.543
This is not so important as your own realisation
and your own ascent [because] the whole knowledge

01:10:47.543 --> 01:10:48.692
will be dawned upon you.

01:10:48.692 --> 01:10:50.393
You don’t have to bother!

01:10:50.393 --> 01:10:53.393
Every word now you read, you will have a meaning
about it and you will understand.

01:10:53.393 --> 01:10:57.333
The first thing is that you must get your
realisation, second thing is you must ascend.

01:10:57.333 --> 01:11:00.643
You must ascend much more and give more time
to this.

01:11:00.643 --> 01:11:02.073
Do not take it for granted.

01:11:02.073 --> 01:11:04.343
It is a very important thing which you should
do.

01:11:04.343 --> 01:11:06.632
After all there are other things, they are
important.

01:11:06.632 --> 01:11:09.483
But this is the most important thing which
has to be done.

01:11:09.483 --> 01:11:13.143
By God’s grace, if it works out I’ll be
very happy.

01:11:13.143 --> 01:11:18.723
As it is, I’m extremely happy because in
none of my lives I’ve been able to give

01:11:18.723 --> 01:11:20.793
realisations to so many people.

01:11:20.793 --> 01:11:23.123
So as it is, I am over-satisfied with Myself.

01:11:23.123 --> 01:11:26.853
But as far as you are concerned, you should
not be satisfied, you should ask for more

01:11:26.853 --> 01:11:29.603
and more and more and it will be granted.

01:11:29.603 --> 01:11:32.353
Because you are the people who are on the
stage, you are created for this purpose.

01:11:32.353 --> 01:11:34.003
One has to do it.

01:11:34.003 --> 01:11:36.112
God has to do it.

01:11:36.112 --> 01:11:39.323
If He does not do it, He cannot fulfil His
own desires.

01:11:39.362 --> 01:11:42.543
And His Creation, He is not going to destroy.

01:11:42.583 --> 01:11:44.793
May God bless you!
