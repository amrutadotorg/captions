Try to Become Aware

00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:14,809
Shrirampur, India, 21 December 1989

3
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:14,820
…. Backwards, those who haven’t got space
please move backwards. Be sensible. You all

4
00:00:14,619 --> 00:00:14,869
can see Me very well and those who are far
away are closer to Me; is a fact. When I say

5
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:15,009
the truth, the Vishnumaya is there. Please
be seated. Hello. Uska kya naam? Jenny, you

6
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:15,009
go that side. Don’t sit with men. Must keep
a discipline on yourself. Those who are sitting

7
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:15,009
here please move to the left. Keep a distance.
Now, you are such great Sahaja Yogis, ancient

8
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:15,009
Sahaja Yogis. People look forward to you for
discipline and sense. Mostly those who are

9
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:15,009
very new try to come forward. I’ve seen
that. I can understand if you are a leader

10
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:15,009
if you are sitting in front. But otherwise
what is the need to sit in front? Good. Please

11
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:15,009
be seated. The further you are, you will feel
more vibrations. You can; for this you can

12
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:15,009
testify. The closer you are you’ll feel
less. That’s My trick. [Hindi]

13
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:15,009
Now see, are you feeling more vibrations there?
Jenny, there, see yourself. All right? I never

14
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:15,009
tell lies. I’ll have some water. [Hindi]
No, no, why don’t you have a proper seat?

15
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:16,420
[Hindi] You better have a seat. [Hindi] I’ve
been telling them about something which you

16
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:23,420
need not know. I hope you didn’t understand.
Sometimes I have to speak in English when

17
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:33,089
I want them not to know anything about you.
It’s quite mutual.

18
00:00:33,089 --> 00:00:40,089
All right, so I’m sorry for this delay but
it so happened that they never told Me anything.

19
00:00:40,129 --> 00:00:45,110
I didn’t know that is such a beautiful place
is here. Otherwise I would never have taken

20
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:51,629
you down there for any problem because actually
this is the one that’s also a problem. God

21
00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:58,629
willing Me, we may buy this place. So I must
praise you for your patience and for your

22
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:26,550
sweetness about it that delays do not matter
as long as we have the Pujas. I hope you all

23
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:35,479
have rested very well and your stomach must
be also resting a little bit because you had

24
00:01:35,899 --> 00:01:42,280
a very severe type of an attack of people
who wanted to feed you and it was too much

25
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:49,280
starting from Aurangabad to this place. This
is good once in a while to allow your stomach

26
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:51,170
to rest.

27
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:58,170
Now, I don’t know what to tell you because
as it is you know that we have big plans,

28
00:02:00,209 --> 00:02:06,810
when we, and when I say “we” I mean the
Paramchaitanya and all the deities put together,

29
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:13,810
to expand Sahaja Yoga. It’s not necessary
how many things you give Me. It’s not necessary

30
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:20,720
at all. It’s not necessary how many of us
are there. What's more important is how many

31
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:27,720
people you give realization to. And secondly,
how are you? Have you evolved? Have you really

32
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:38,870
become independent and you can get rid of
all your conditionings, your ego? And have

33
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:47,640
you become a very mild, beautiful, compassionate,
collective personality? So it’s a question

34
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:55,560
of introspection, seeing ourselves. It’s
very important. If we do not have a proper

35
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:04,030
car we cannot drive. In the same way if our
being is in a funny situation then you cannot

36
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:13,190
ascend; that’s a fact. So we have to understand
that the amount we enjoy everything is the

37
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:27,290
sign how much we have achieved. If there’s
a little cup then a very little joy can go

38
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:36,430
into it. But if there’s a large cup it gets
much more joy in it. But if it is like an

39
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:43,430
ocean all the rivers of joys fall into it.
So it is the amount of enjoyment you have.

40
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:51,630
Not fun, I mean enjoyment. I’m not saying
frivolousness, cheapishness, but a very majestic,

41
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:59,330
deep enjoyment that you have within yourself,
which just bubbles into you, makes you very

42
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:06,180
happy, and you don’t know why you are happy,
just enjoying your happiness. Then one has

43
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:12,630
to say that you have really become a Sahaja
Yogi. And then, at that stage you want to

44
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:17,819
share it. Don’t you keep it to yourself.
You’ll work very hard, do everything that

45
00:04:17,819 --> 00:04:24,270
is possible under the sun. Your mind will
think how to spread it, how to give this joy

46
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:30,300
to others. You won’t be happy unless and
until you communicate with others. So first

47
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:37,300
you become the capitalist and then you become
a communist.

48
00:04:37,889 --> 00:04:44,889
So first thing is how far we are enjoying.
Second is what have we got in our mind now,

49
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:53,199
how are we going to expand Sahaja Yoga outside.
First, the light has to improve and automatically

50
00:04:53,199 --> 00:05:00,050
the light has to spread. What is the relationships
we have with ourselves, which I have told

51
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:05,909
you before also, don’t form groups. This
is the country; that is the country. I would

52
00:05:05,909 --> 00:05:12,909
request you to change the buses and put different
people into the buses and let us see if they

53
00:05:13,669 --> 00:05:20,669
reach in one piece or not or there is a big
quarrel and a fight. If there is any quarrel

54
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:28,610
or argument then drop that person on the way
and let him come by another bus. We don’t

55
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:39,740
want argumentative spoiled sports with us.
So just put them on the ground, I tell you.

56
00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:44,370
And it’s a, it’s definitely, you must
know that I am telling you in the presence

57
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:50,879
of everyone, anybody who is difficult just
ask him to get down here, “Please be here.

58
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:57,879
Some bus will be coming and take you.” So
try to find out who are the spoiled sports.

59
00:05:59,539 --> 00:06:03,770
Another thing is some people have developed
a habit of moving their neck a bit too much.

60
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:08,139
Even in singing they move their neck so much,
then their body. You can move your body but

61
00:06:08,139 --> 00:06:13,460
not the neck. Neck should be moved with the
body. Yesterday I had a problem with My liver.

62
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:19,180
Then I thought you all have livers. But then
it was Vishuddhi and Vishuddhi must have come

63
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:25,319
from the way you people move your neck. Like
if you say, “Yes, yes, yes, yes.” Or if

64
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:30,719
you don’t want to say also, if I’m saying
anything you’ll go on like this, nodding.

65
00:06:30,719 --> 00:06:35,800
So don’t do all these things. That spoils
your Vishuddhi. As it is you have bad Vishuddhis,

66
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:42,800
thanks to this Roman Catholic Church and the
other church which just talks. So please try

67
00:06:42,919 --> 00:06:49,719
to keep your neck in line with your body all
the time and even if you have to move, move

68
00:06:49,719 --> 00:06:55,729
very slightly your neck, not with jerks, and
don’t go on nodding. While music time I’ve

69
00:06:55,729 --> 00:07:02,729
seen many people do not move their body. But
if you see the Indians, they move their body.

70
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,869
So this is one of a very small thing but is
important because your Vishuddhis have to

71
00:07:07,869 --> 00:07:13,449
be all right. There should be no problem on
your Vishuddhis. For liver also, there are

72
00:07:13,449 --> 00:07:19,729
some people I see still with liver who are
very thin people. They should be asked to

73
00:07:19,729 --> 00:07:26,729
stand in the water for one hour and clear
out themselves. If you are very thin, be sure

74
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:36,300
it is not a normal thing. It is not natural.
It is abnormal to be very thin. So work it

75
00:07:36,849 --> 00:07:43,029
out ‒ it’s all your liver ‒ and later
on you can have a session of checking yourselves

76
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:48,069
somewhere sitting. Before meditation you can
check yourselves what is wrong with you before

77
00:07:48,069 --> 00:07:52,039
My photograph and then you should go into
meditation.

78
00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:58,099
So now we are here on a pilgrimage to achieve
a higher state of awareness. Awareness is

79
00:07:58,099 --> 00:08:05,099
the main point, you should be absolutely aware.
As we were coming, I just said, “Now, this

80
00:08:09,719 --> 00:08:13,699
is wrong road.” They said, “How do you
know Mother?” I said, “Just I know. Just

81
00:08:13,699 --> 00:08:20,699
find out.” Just to know everything you need
not do anything about it. But that is the

82
00:08:22,729 --> 00:08:29,009
sign that you have become very aware. To be
aware of everything, it is not like sitting

83
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:36,009
down here that you should say, “Oh, it’s
very beautiful. Oh, it’s very grand.”

84
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:41,349
That’s not the point ‒ not to certify,
not to criticize ‒ but how much do you know.

85
00:08:41,349 --> 00:08:48,349
Feel it in the atmosphere. Because we have
a very big brain and we have two loops in

86
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:57,110
our head, is not one brain but two loops.
And when the awareness starts giving you light

87
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:07,339
you start knowing within yourself everything
and you are silent. You don’t have to assert,

88
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:17,550
manipulate or to exert yourself but just to
know. And that’s a very beautiful thing

89
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:26,670
one has to do. Those people who do not feel
vibrations must feel their vibrations in these

90
00:09:27,019 --> 00:09:34,019
two. They have to feel their vibrations in
these two. And those who are still complaining

91
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:43,170
about their troubles and stomachs and livers
and this and that should get treated immediately

92
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:50,680
and get well.

93
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:56,509
Another thing which I can tell you which is
very important that in India you must comb

94
00:09:56,509 --> 00:10:02,560
you properly because they think you are all
beggars. Only the beggars have hair like this.

95
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:09,079
Please put oil and make your hair properly.
They’ll not have any respect for you. You

96
00:10:09,079 --> 00:10:15,050
must have properly combed hair, groomed hair.
Otherwise they think you are something mad,

97
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:20,100
or you are hippies or something gone wrong
with you. They don’t appreciate this fashion.

98
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:27,100
Please make your hair properly, absolutely
in a proper way as they used to do. When we

99
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:33,440
saw your western pictures when we were young,
they all were very well-groomed people. Now

100
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:40,440
suddenly this fashion stupid has come to make
you all bald-headed and then to sell their

101
00:10:41,189 --> 00:10:48,189
‒ what you call them ‒ wigs. So this stupid
idea is wrong. Will you please now see that

102
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:56,800
your hair are properly groomed and not to
have any hair on your, this thing. It’s

103
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:02,610
a sign of stupidity in this country. Anybody
has, who has hair on the forehead it’s a

104
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:09,610
sign of stupidity. We call it as “giprya”.
I asked Neeta what is the fashion now. She

105
00:11:13,269 --> 00:11:19,019
told Me in Marathi it is “giprya”. “Giprya”
means a person who gets mad or lunatic as

106
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:25,129
the hair, hair you see like that. At least
we Sahaja Yogis should not follow such stupid

107
00:11:25,129 --> 00:11:32,129
fashions. They now take out hair like this,
you see. I just don’t know, like moustaches

108
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:39,430
coming out of the head. You should be proud
of your forehead. It’s the Ekadesha. You

109
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:51,610
have to fight the whole world with this Ekadesha
of yours. So please see that you keep your

110
00:11:52,029 --> 00:11:58,860
forehead absolutely open, hair properly done
and oily. That will also soothe you. In the

111
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:04,060
night you can put some oil and it will soothe
you. You’ll find it very much better; specially

112
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:09,689
for liver patient is very important. They
must put oil in their heads because they are

113
00:12:09,689 --> 00:12:16,680
dried out people. There’s no fat in their
hair and the hair do not grow. They become

114
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:23,569
immediately bald as soon as they achieve twenty-five
to thirty years of age. I don’t want to

115
00:12:23,569 --> 00:12:30,569
have bald-headed Sahaja Yogis. Otherwise you’ll
have to wear the [shadings] like the Hare

116
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:38,180
Rama Hare Krishna. If you make such clownish
appearances I’m worried about you because

117
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:47,420
you don’t see the point what I am trying
to make. Look after your hair; it’s very

118
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,100
important.

119
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:57,100
All right, now last but not the least is a
request that we are here for meditation. Though

120
00:13:01,089 --> 00:13:05,360
we may sleep late I always get up at four
o’clock. Whatever time you may sleep, get

121
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:10,120
up at four o’clock, do your meditation.
You can go after to sleep again. But that’s

122
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:15,209
the best time to get up, have your baths,
whatever way you want, or wash yourself and

123
00:13:15,209 --> 00:13:20,889
just go for meditation. And then you can sleep
off again. That time you will find you will

124
00:13:20,889 --> 00:13:27,889
be quite alert and awake. It’s not so difficult.
You’ll all be awakened. I will awaken you.

125
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:36,220
But please see that you get up in the morning,
do your meditation from four to five and then

126
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:40,930
go off to sleep.

127
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:47,610
We have to write a book about the Sahaj culture.
But it is going to come out of you people.

128
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:53,259
If I write something then I am manipulating
you, I’m trying to tell you, but you have

129
00:13:53,259 --> 00:14:00,259
to write something yourself. You have to bring
out what is Sahaj culture is. You are already

130
00:14:01,999 --> 00:14:08,800
manifesting it without My telling you now.
So what is the Sahaj culture, how we work

131
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:15,800
it out, ourselves, our things ‒ I don’t
tell you all these things into details. Also,

132
00:14:16,509 --> 00:14:23,319
try to judge where is your attention, what
are you doing about your attention. All the

133
00:14:23,319 --> 00:14:30,319
time keep an attention on your attention.
Where is my attention? Mr. Attention, where

134
00:14:30,379 --> 00:14:36,550
are you lost? And that will work out for you.
So now for today it’s sufficient.

135
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:42,290
Already we are very late and I hope My lecture
doesn’t go over your heads or on the sides

136
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:47,379
of your ears. It should go inside and you
should record it and whatever I am saying

137
00:14:47,379 --> 00:14:47,629
it’s very important. May God bless you all.
[Hindi]

138
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:47,810
Will you please polish those things some time
and show them? All right. [Hindi]

139
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:50,509
All the small children can come ‒ up to
ten years.
