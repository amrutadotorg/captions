1
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:16,760
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

2
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:26,300
You are all here to seek the truth.

3
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:33,800
One has to realize that truth is what it is.

4
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:42,240
We have to know the truth; Truth does not have to know us.

5
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:51,560
And the truth lies within us, within our being and the instrument

6
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:56,560
of knowing the truth is what he has described it to you today.

7
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:08,620
Now if you have got your eyes, you can see clearly

8
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:16,340
that this is a white color. You don't have to pay to your eyes for that -

9
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:21,080
that's a truth. You all see the same thing.

10
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:30,560
If you are passing through a dirty lane, it's obnoxious

11
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:38,800
and you know it's a dirty lane you're passing through.

12
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:44,500
But a dog does not know the truth, a horse does not know.

13
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,920
They can all pass through that without feeling anything about it.

14
00:01:54,360 --> 00:02:00,480
So you are at a higher level than all the animals put together,

15
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:08,720
all the living things that you see, you are at a higher place.

16
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:14,940
So, what is the purpose

17
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:19,740
of our being human-beings.

18
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:29,120
The only purpose is to know the truth.

19
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:37,400
Many people say that truth is love and love is truth.

20
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:45,920
People don't understand. At human level it's a very illusive,

21
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:55,040
deceiving sentence. Maybe, love may not be the truth, truth may not be love.

22
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:04,700
But when they say truth is love, they mean to say

23
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:10,760
that the All- Pervading power of God'e love

24
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,600
which is in a subtle form,

25
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:23,480
which runs all our living processes

26
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,580
is the truth.

27
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:36,540
All of them, all the great Scriptures have described

28
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:44,660
that All-Pervading power of God exists.

29
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:54,600
You have never felt it so, you should keep your minds open about it.

30
00:03:55,300 --> 00:04:01,080
Not to close your minds - it's unscientific, I think, to close your minds.

31
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:08,120
And if there is something existing like that, why should we not know it?

32
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:19,100
It is our birthright to know about that truth which pervades

33
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:24,380
all over.

34
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:32,160
Scientifically it is said that we have evolved from amoeba stage.

35
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:41,260
Why have we evolved from amoeba stage to human stage and have we reached our last stage?

36
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:50,060
Have we reached our Absolute stage? Are we at an Absolute point?

37
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:56,500
We are not. The proof is we are in a chaos.

38
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:04,980
We do not know what is right, what is wrong. We cannot say this is right and this is wrong.

39
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:10,060
All of us do not say the same thing.

40
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:18,500
Then that's not the truth because we have not reached the stage where

41
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:25,600
we feel the truth, all of us the same.

42
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:34,420
But our idea about truth is very different.

43
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:41,080
I've already told you, it's not an idea; Truth is what it is -

44
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:45,140
is the existence of Truth.

45
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:53,000
So some people think that truth is in belonging to certain faiths

46
00:05:55,460 --> 00:06:02,260
or believing into certain groups or into some fanaticism

47
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:11,400
or could be some sort of a false guru who does not know the truth itself.

48
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:23,860
But one should know one thing for definite that if we have to evolve, it has to be done through some living process.

49
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:35,320
And the living process cannot be explained but can be experienced.

50
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:42,260
Now in the human body anything foreign that goes in is thrown out.

51
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:47,660
But when a lady conceives

52
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:55,320
that foreign body is nourished, nurtured and thrown out at a right point.

53
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:01,920
Nobody can explain how it happens.

54
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:09,700
It can be explained what is the mechanism that works it out.

55
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:16,400
In the same way one can explain the mechanism that works out your re-birth

56
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:24,120
where you know the truth and the truth dawns upon you

57
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:32,920
that you are the Spirit, you are the reflector of God.

58
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:40,360
This is the truth you have to know.

59
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:47,360
For that, there is a mechanism placed within us beautifully.

60
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:55,060
Of course, doctors may not know about it for the time being - they know little bit.

61
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:01,240
Then the Parasympathetic Nervous System they call it, about which they don't know much.

62
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:09,120
Now within us lies, as you see, the three channels -

63
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:14,840
one on the left, one on the right and one in the center of the Autonomous Nervous System.

64
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:22,640
And these three channels represent on the left side

65
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:31,100
the emotional side, the desire side and the right channel

66
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,880
is for the actions of these emotions and desires

67
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:44,100
and the central path is for coordinating and co-operating.

68
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:53,560
All the problems that human-beings have

69
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:59,200
are caused by their imbalances - very simple thing it is.

70
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:06,180
If you go to the roots of everything, this is the knowledge of the roots, of our roots.

71
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:12,760
They're very simple problems because

72
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:18,720
When you have imbalances, when you go too much to the left

73
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,920
or too much to the right, you create imbalances.

74
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:28,060
and these imbalances cause

75
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:33,860
physical, mental, emotional, spiritual problems.

76
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:45,880
Of course there could be also Psychosomatic both combined - like emotional combined with physical also.

77
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:54,100
But it's a simple thing is that you go into an extreme

78
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:04,220
in anything. The human nature is such that we must go to the extremes.

79
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:11,080
Like one gentleman used to smoke a lot and I started coughing.

80
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:18,980
It was a no smoking zone. I requested the gentleman, "Sir, if you don't mind

81
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:24,720
I've to give a speech in the evening, can you stop smoking?" He said, "No, I can't."

82
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:31,040
I kept quiet. So he has a double problem.

83
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:39,820
First is the problem that he cannot get over his habit - that is his left side

84
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:45,320
and the another problem is the right side that he cannot get over his ego.

85
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:49,720
Such combinations could be there.

86
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:58,140
But basically the problem is that you cannot remain in the center, in the balance.

87
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:05,200
Sometimes you go to one extreme, from there you go to another extreme.

88
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:12,740
Like some people who're extremely dominating, very arrogant,

89
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:19,380
hot-tempered, suddenly become very sullen,

90
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:24,640
quiet, depressed.

91
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:31,120
Half of the life they impress other and half of the life they get depressions.

92
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:39,420
Such personalities we have all around us and within us.

93
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:48,200
Now how to keep in the center, is the problem nowadays because there are so many

94
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:55,180
alterations to our attention all the time, you have to alter it.

95
00:11:55,780 --> 00:12:01,520
Today you have to, say T.V., then there's a politics going on, then this is going on, that is going on -

96
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:08,780
our mind is all the time changing from one to another, skipping from one to another.

97
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:14,360
We are living in a very hectic type of world

98
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:19,260
where our attention is not at all steady in the center - it cannot remain.

99
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:29,120
At this juncture, thank God, the modern sahaja yoga was born - I was found out.

100
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,500
Formerly, one or two persons used to get realization -

101
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:44,640
very few people used to get realization, at the beginning of the tree of life, I should say.

102
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:55,120
But I thought, in those days of complete chaos

103
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:01,900
and such a lot of pressures on people -

104
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,460
they have no time to go to Himalayas and work it out.

105
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:15,240
You have to have something very instant. But there was a problem with it.

106
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:23,260
Supposing you try to enlighten people and they just get a wee bit,

107
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:27,340
then what happens.

108
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,020
Formerly they used to cleanse the body, everything

109
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:38,440
for years together and ultimately give the realization to one person - good for nothing.

110
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:47,200
Nobody understood any Incarnations, [UNCLEAR] prophets or saints because they talked of some another world.

111
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:56,920
That's why they crucified Christ or gave poison to Mohammad Sahab - did all kinds of things all over the world.

112
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:06,140
With sahaja yoga this mechanism is activated

113
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:11,560
where you have got this Kundalini, the power,

114
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:16,360
that manifests your Self-realization.

115
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:22,640
She's a power, I call it She because it's the Mother's power -

116
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:29,020
it is your Mother, She gives you birth so She's your Mother and She's your individual Mother.

117
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:34,780
She takes all problems upon Herself. Every time I've been giving lectures, people ask,

118
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:41,140
"But we have read in such and such book that Kundalini rising gives troubles." I just don't know.

119
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,200
Either they're negative people who are trying to keep you away from reality

120
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:52,120
or maybe, they don't know what Kundalini is.

121
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:59,920
She is your Mother, waiting all these days, within yourself - this power -

122
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:04,660
in 31/2 coils because it's some mathematics about it.

123
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:15,580
And She is activated then she rises just like a primule in a seed.

124
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:23,600
As soon as you put the seed in the Mother Earth and nourish it with little water,

125
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:32,280
in the same way, with little love, the Divine love, She's activated and She starts rising.

126
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:42,400
With your naked eyes, in some people who have obstructions, in the lower chakras you can see clearly

127
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:50,500
the pulsation at the triangular bone. With your naked eyes you can see it clearly.

128
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:55,060
Imagine a bone pulsating like a heart

129
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:01,480
and you can see the rising and you can see it's obstruction where it stops

130
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:06,240
Supposing you are a liver patient, it will go to your liver first.

131
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:12,240
informing that first liver should be corrected.

132
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:20,980
Or maybe if you are a great seeker, then She shoots off, comes out, out of your

133
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:28,440
fontanel bone area but again She descends back to the problems where

134
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:34,860
She has to attend - is a very practical thing to understand.

135
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:42,720
Sahaja yoga, you cannot pay for it - is nonsense. How can you pay for anything that is living?

136
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:48,820
When you pay for God or somebody says, "I'm God or this and that," you pay money. I've been telling you,

137
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:57,640
I've been here four times before, every year I was telling you,"You can't pay for God, God doesn't understand money, this is your headache,

138
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:02,720
why do you want to pay for anything that is living process?"

139
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:10,380
But nobody liked Me at that time, to such an extent that in England they told Me

140
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,360
that Anglo-Saxon brain cannot understand anything without money.

141
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:19,760
I was surprised, who has made this brain God has made or somebody else.

142
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:27,440
You cannot pay for it, that is the first criteria.

143
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:32,840
It's your own right to have it, it's sahaja, born with you.

144
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:43,180
And when She rises, She pierces through all these six chakras - the one chakra is below Her, which guards

145
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:49,500
the movement of the Kundalini completely and rises through six chakras

146
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:55,020
and pierces through the sixth chakra, giving you a cool breeze of the Holy Ghost.

147
00:17:56,820 --> 00:18:03,080
Now no one knows who is the Holy Ghost. Holy Ghost is the power of God,

148
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:11,160
is the desire of God and She is reflected

149
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:16,980
as Kundalini in the triangular bone.

150
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:28,080
That desire is the pure desire within us. All our desires are impure because they never give us satisfaction.

151
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:35,540
Economic says that in general wants are not satiable.

152
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,740
So now, we have got

153
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:52,460
the knowledge about the mechanism but it must work.

154
00:18:52,720 --> 00:19:00,720
For example, in this hall you see beautiful lights are there and you must have put just one switch and everything must have

155
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:07,040
manifested but there's a mechanism behind it, a history behind it.

156
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:15,740
All these centers are the mile stones of our evolution. The last one is this,

157
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:22,680
is the limbic area which is called as Sahastrara.

158
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:32,820
If you cut the brain horizontally, you can see as if you have cut a lotus

159
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:41,140
and the inner part is a vacuum which is the limbic area.

160
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:50,300
So this Kundalini enters into the limbic area, opens from both the sides this

161
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:58,420
calyx or the outside of this lotus and pierces through that.

162
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:04,300
Now what is the calyx that we have formed, are two uh..

163
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:10,480
balloon like growths within us - one is the ego.

164
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:18,560
When we work, when we do anything, you always think we have done it.

165
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:22,900
Now just see what we have done, is dead to dead.

166
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:30,180
For example, from some tree they must have made this platform - which was a dead tree, made another dead thing.

167
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:40,800
From something dead they have made the chairs. Now if you're sitting on the chairs, you can't sit on the ground - the chair sits on our head.

168
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:45,560
Wherever you move you have to take the chair with you, otherwise you can't sit.

169
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:51,320
So this matter is trying to overpower us.

170
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:58,320
That's all. This is the ego that builds within us.

171
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:04,580
We have done nothing but just change forms from dead to dead.

172
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:08,560
Here I'm talking about transforming

173
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:18,880
uh.. human-being into a new human-being, into a human-being where there is spiritual light.

174
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:26,960
In Sanskrit language, a person who is a realized soul as called as 'dwijah' - means born twice

175
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:33,340
and also a bird is called as a 'dwijah' meaning the bird

176
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:38,520
also comes as an egg and then becomes the bird.

177
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:46,320
In the same way we get a transformation and that transformation

178
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:53,960
brings us to a position where we are in Absolute status,

179
00:21:54,780 --> 00:22:02,720
in Absolute condition. When the Kundalini passes through Agnya chakra - here, this one, the center of Christ

180
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:10,740
- She pushes down both these ego and superego, which you see the two balloon like structures.

181
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:19,840
As a result of that we get a soft bone opened up again, as you had in your childhood

182
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:28,340
and you feel thoughtless, there's no thought. If you want to think, you can think

183
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:35,120
but no body is going on inside all the time - you feel the peace within yourself.

184
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:42,100
And when She pierces through completely then you feel the cool breeze coming out of your head

185
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:48,360
and also if your this center is all right, you can feel the cool breeze around.

186
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:59,760
As a result of that the centers which are like this, we can say, the centers

187
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:05,840
which have moved because of our left and right movement on the sides and have broken

188
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:14,240
the connection with the whole, again go back to their original positions and they get nourished

189
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:18,860
and the energy that was exhausted in them starts flowing.

190
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:25,680
That's how our physical, mental, emotional and spiritual being is corrected.

191
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:35,440
Most of the diseases can be cured with this Kundalini awakening but I'm not curing you,

192
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:44,680
you are curing yourself. Only thing is your medicine lies within you which has to rise and give you this. This is all yours

193
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:54,720
for which why should you pay anyone, why should you feel obliged - I'm just a catalyst.

194
00:23:56,220 --> 00:24:03,500
If this happens to you, is a very great thing because then your hands will speak -

195
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:09,260
as Mohammad sahab has said that, "At the time of resurrection your hands will speak."

196
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:16,840
Hands start speaking means what, that on your finger-tips you can feel the seven centers

197
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:22,560
and you can see in another person what's wrong with the other person, what's wrong with your self.

198
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:31,160
Now only if you know what is the decoding is and how to cure a particular center

199
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:35,880
finished - don't have to do anything else but this much.

200
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:46,320
Of course in some people who are mentally, physically, emotionally, specially spiritually are sick,

201
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:50,760
it takes little time to settle down.

202
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:58,000
Though you might get your realization today but the Kundalini has to be brought back and to be settled there.

203
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:06,920
Like, like a little sapling you have to look after it in the beginning and then you absolutely become the master.

204
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:13,640
I've seen people who had their realization as late as

205
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:20,380
'84 or '85, are today great masters of sahaja yoga.

206
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:30,580
It's very surprising. Now these masters of sahaja yoga don't stand on their heads,

207
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:39,300
don't do abnormal things, they don't have to do much jogging or anything - your body comes to that position what you need.

208
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:48,480
For example, somebody needs more water so it's all right, somebody doesn't need  more water, it's all right but certain,

209
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:55,580
certain kind of uh.. exercises which are needed to improve the condition

210
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,820
of the particular chakras can be done.

211
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:07,280
But the main thing is to keep the Kundalini here so that the Spirit which is in your heart -

212
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:12,580
has a seat here - is all the time kept enlightened.

213
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:20,400
That's the main job. Now the biggest problem I face today is this,

214
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:28,760
that in India people are quite capable to know who is a real master who is not.

215
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:34,740
Thank God we are not so rich to throw our money for realization.

216
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:44,100
So, we don't have these false gurus there. They all come to Australia or to America - wherever there is money they're coming down.

217
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:54,420
But the main problem - I don't mind there are lots of thugs in this world, you see, smugglers are there, it's all right

218
00:26:55,300 --> 00:27:03,360
and there are many people who are cheated, it's all right - but the main thing is they attack the Kundalini,

219
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:12,720
they attack the central path. I've known many people getting cancer

220
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:18,140
because they have been to some gurus because it is a psychosomatic thing, even AIDS

221
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:22,500
uh..could be due to certain things

222
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:28,500
I had cured one fellow who was doing TM, I'd cured him completely.

223
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:35,720
Doctors said that he's completely cured of AIDS but again he started uh..going to some TM fellow, again he got it

224
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:42,920
and he died - it was in Australia. Then I gave it up because you get frustrated with such people.

225
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:49,380
When I told him not to go to that person, particular person, then again he went down to that person

226
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:57,280
because these people are using all these false gurus, are using some sort of spirits

227
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:05,280
to keep you bound to them so that all that you have your money, your properties, everything they get.

228
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:11,040
Their main purpose, the honesty of purpose is that they want money - that's all.

229
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:16,900
Money they can have but money they can't have unless they mesmerize you

230
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:21,000
or involve you into something nonsensical.

231
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:30,600
I've seen people getting into trouble, very much, if they have had wrong gurus

232
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:38,640
and I'm surprised. These gurus have given them nothing, they have taken all their money,

233
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:45,760
they have taken all their wisdom, they have lost their jobs but still they are sticking on  to them like leeches.

234
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:57,700
In London we have people from TM itself, I would say - there are people in London who are recluses, absolutely.

235
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:05,440
They're suffering from some sort of a secret disease they can't explain. Some of the politicians are suffering

236
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:12,720
but still they going on and on and on and I've been telling openly about it, nobody listens to Me.

237
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:19,020
It happened when I told them in '83 or '84

238
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:24,320
that this disease is going to come to America - they didn't listen to Me.

239
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:32,440
I told on the television from Santiago, from Los Angeles, from San Francisco, from New York

240
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:39,240
but nobody bothered about it and today when I go there they all say, "Mother, we are in it."

241
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:46,600
And you get disgusted with them because they are so much now weak that they cannot get over

242
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,480
all those attachments they have had.

243
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:56,100
It's the attack of the negative.

244
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:04,580
Tremendous negativity is working out that you don't get your realization,

245
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,860
that you don't achieve your highest.

246
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:18,560
So much of negativity everywhere I find and I just don't know how I am going to help all of you.

247
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:26,420
First of all you must understand that all these wrong things have rendered nothing to you and nothing to anybody else.

248
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:35,300
So many cases of cancer have been cured by sahaja yoga - we're making now a big file out of it.

249
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:42,100
Recently, the Delhi University has given us a

250
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:49,480
PhD. for doctors for research in sahaja yoga, even Cambridge may do it.

251
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:55,140
There are so many doctors busy to find out how sahaja yoga has cured

252
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:59,500
so many types of cancers,  livers, diabetes.

253
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:07,800
Already papers have been published about how the physical health

254
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:11,100
of the people has improved by doing sahaja yoga.

255
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:20,360
Blood pressures, tensions all these things managed.

256
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:28,840
These sahaja yogies don't lead an abnormal life. They wear normal dresses, they live like normal, decent,

257
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:37,100
of course decent people, not like cutting this part of the hair, that part of the hair, then putting tar on your head.

258
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:42,180
The other day I said, "We are not hippopotamus to do all these things, you see."

259
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:49,080
All sorts of abnormal things they give up. They become sensible, serene, good citizens.

260
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:55,540
They have good wives. We had 71 marriages this year.

261
00:31:55,780 --> 00:32:02,300
and you'll be happy to know that all of them are very successful and they have very great children born to them.

262
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:10,140
Children won't be born to people who are all the time fighting among themselves, wasting their life.

263
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:17,120
Only bad people will be born to them who can bear all that but good children are born to sahaja yogies.

264
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:24,400
I'm so happy to see, in Melbourne, we had a very good report from the government

265
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:28,460
for our schools that whatever they proclaim, that they are.

266
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:35,220
How many schools can do that, though it's rather difficult here to run private schools.

267
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:43,740
In all fields sahaja yoga is showing good results because once a person is transformed

268
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:50,540
most of your problems will drop out - you are such a satisfied person you will not be a dishonest politician,

269
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:59,880
you'll not be a dishonest preacher, you'll not be a bad father, bad mother

270
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:06,500
and not arrogant children. A beautiful society is established now -

271
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:12,000
in Sydney we lots of people, in Melbourne also.

272
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:21,620
Only thing is you have to come in the center and to come in the center you have to have your Kundalini awakened, free of cost.

273
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:30,120
It sounds fantastic, it sounds out of the blue normally

274
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:38,560
but it's nothing so fantastic. Say for example, now you have got a T.V. here but in Indian villages they have not seen the T.V.

275
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:44,920
Now if you take the T.V. there and say, "You can see everything whatever is happening in the whole world."

276
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:52,880
They will say, "Ah! What are you telling us stories, how can it be?" Then you put it to the mains and it works.

277
00:33:54,140 --> 00:34:01,020
In the same way you are made beautifully within yourselves. Human-beings are the greatest computers,

278
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:07,740
the greatest knowledgeable things - the whole knowledge rests within them.

279
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:15,960
All that is within has come out and has become the so-called knowledge but they become the knowers.

280
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:25,280
And when it happens, suddenly you find dynamic things happening.

281
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:31,560
We had a boy in Portugal who was doing little pottery work.

282
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:37,840
He came to sahaja yoga, today he is a very big potter earning lots of money.

283
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:46,420
We had some people who used to just paint ordinarily - they have become very great painters and earning quite a lot, in your country.

284
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:53,720
You just become dynamic and things work out in every way possible.

285
00:34:54,800 --> 00:35:00,700
In this short time, whatever is possible for the introduction I have told you but tomorrow in details I'll tell you

286
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:06,420
all that can work out with sahaja yoga. May God bless you all!

287
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:17,300
Today being the first day, I: would like to give some time for questioning.

288
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:29,020
But ask sensible questions, I'm not seeking votes nor I'm going for an election.

289
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:35,640
Here I am to give you what you have, so don't ask questions which are aggressive.

290
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:41,820
Or if you belong to some group - like the other day we had somebody from 'Born Again' or something -

291
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:47,920
they're already having trouble and he came to hit Me and all that; So that sort of a thing is not needed.

292
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:56,140
[UNCLEAR]

293
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:06,780
Rustom, tum aa jao zara, koi bhi aa jaaye. Unko bolo, Rajesh hai, Rajesh.

294
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:10,980
[UNCLEAR N INAUDIBLE]

295
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:14,860
- Somebody has to come [UNCLEAR]
 - [UNCLEAR]

296
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:21,000
- No question?
 - Yes, one question Mother. Are you a guru or do you have a guru?

297
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:26,740
No, I had no guru and I'm a Mother, I'm not a guru.

298
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:34,000
See guru is, of course in a way Mother is a guru all the time - she's a teacher all the time - no?

299
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:40,880
But there's a big difference between a real guru and a mother. See, real guru in India

300
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:47,480
will give you a real hard time - never go near them.

301
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:59,740
One fellow who came all the way from Himalayas, he told Me, "My guru has come here and he wants to come and meet You."

302
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:05,240
They also regard Me as their Mother and they also respect Me.

303
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:12,040
So I said, "All right, I'll go and see him now." So went there.

304
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:19,800
So on the way he said, "Today, my guru hanged me uh.. by a rope

305
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:25,560
upside down in a well and kept me hanging there for six hours

306
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:30,120
and he used to dip me every time, every hour and

307
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:38,520
then he brought me up and said, 'Now you go and call Mataji.'" I said, "What's that, it's terrible! I mean, why is he so cruel?"

308
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:45,460
So I asked his guru, I said, "What do you mean by treating him like this, you have no business? Why do you treat him, he's a seeker?"

309
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:49,800
He said, "Do you know he was smoking?

310
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:55,820
Smoking he's doing at this time, what will happen to him, why should I give him realization?"

311
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:04,080
So I said, "What's the problem with his realization?" So he went inside. The guru just got angry, went inside.

312
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:12,340
I said, "What's the matter with you?" He said, "My Agnya chakra is catching and my guru says that, "Nobody opened mu Agnya chakra for ten years

313
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:20,000
and I'm not going to open your Agnya chakra." I said, "Why? Just come here." One minute I opened his Agnya chakra - he got his realization.

314
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:28,820
So he came out, the guru. He said, "That's Mother! That's not a guru, that's a Mother. She can do it, not me. Who opened my Agnya chakra?"

315
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:33,300
Like that, you see - they're terrible, they take you to task.

316
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:40,940
So don't go near a real guru - they will not take any money or anything but take you to task.

317
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:48,900
It's better take your sahaja yoga and become yourself a guru of your own. And no use asking questions about Me. It doesn't,

318
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:57,940
doesn't help much - better know yourself. I'm here for you to know yourself. You know yourself, then you'll know Me better, isn't it?

319

- [INAUDIBLE]
 - [UNCLEAR]

320
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:14,600
How do you stop being sad about things - sometimes it is very hard

321
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:20,160
- Sometimes..
 - It's very hard to be stop, to stop being sad.
  - Sad?

322
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:26,260
Because you are very left sided, that's why you are sad.

323
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:31,200
If I bring you in the center, you'll be joy and a source of joy too.

324
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:42,600
Something gone wrong with the machine, you see. Supposing something goes wrong with this machine, it will make funny noises.

325
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:48,060
Supposing I'm an expert mechanic, I can correct it then it's flowing all right.

326
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:04,600
- Mother, I want to ask a question.
 - Please get up, please and we can't hear you, sir.

327
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:12,200
- Yes please, sir.
 - [INAUDIBLE]

328
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:20,780
[INAUDIBLE N UNCLEAR]

329
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:27,220
- [INAUDIBLE N UNCLEAR]
 - Hmm?

330
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:33,900
- Right. You have talked to us about the curing of diseases
 - Hmm

331
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:40,660
Uh..You have not mentioned so much about the prevention of diseases or the causes of them.

332
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:48,380
You see, you don't get diseases at all after realization so there's no need to work out much of prevention.

333
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:53,060
After realization you don't pay any bills to the doctor.

334
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:59,760
So the preventions are not needed but in certain things, like say, supposing somebody's a liver patient -

335
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:07,940
now in sahaja yoga we have two types of livers. Say we have one liver which is a lethargic liver and another one which is a

336
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:13,020
active liver, supposing somebody has. Then we tell them

337
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:19,440
as to the change of diet for sometime, for both the things - different diets they have, just the opposite.

338
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:26,000
And once they come to normal conditions then they have to give up their dieting - then they are all right.

339
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:31,860
So the prevention is not much needed because you become such a different person

340
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:37,580
that you're not tempted to do something that is not good, normally and

341
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:44,620
I don't think sahaja yogies normally get sick except for some adamant one. The other one we had one here

342
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:49,760
in Adelaide. I think he was a boy, a very nasty type of a boy

343
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:58,060
and he was keeping three dogs and he put his tongue into their mouths, just like a very horrid, satanic type, you see.

344
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:06,240
He would not listen to us, he was just trying to trouble us and then he got some troubles because he used to jump with them and do all kinds of things.

345
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:13,540
And then he got some sort of a trouble - we can't help it because he never listened to us and he troubled us a lot.

346
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:22,680
So precautions are, like say, some ladies say are very dominating

347
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:29,580
to their husbands, say, or a husband is very dominating to the wife - that also causes problems.

348
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:37,860
But gradually they become very sensible and understand their role as husband and wife.

349
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:45,180
So the problem disappears - can be very serious problems. If the husband is very dominating or say,

350
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:52,860
he's a flirtish type of a man or he goes about with other women or he keeps the woman in a very umm.

351
00:42:53,780 --> 00:43:01,060
say, in a suspense all the time or in jealousies and things like that,

352
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:08,680
then she can develop a cancer of the breast. For that we cannot cure the husband

353
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:16,960
because if the husband is not in sahaja yoga what to do. So we make the woman so strong - she, she doesn't feel anything about it, she doesn't bother herself.

354
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:24,520
Like that. You become, you see, you, you do not have reactionary nature - you become yourself something

355
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:31,200
You're not, no more a reactionary. So there is not too much prevention needed because you're so strong,

356
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:37,860
you don't need much prevention but if it is needed, we tell them. For example, now,

357
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:46,800
somebody's smoking too much in the room, smoking room or something, there of course we feel that we should at least cover our

358
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:52,520
face with something to get the smoke in because they become sensitive also to all these things.

359
00:43:54,220 --> 00:44:00,360
But not too much of preventions because you become very different. Your temptations

360
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:06,320
are different and you just don't worry about all these things which ruin you.

361
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:12,900
Now you jump, say, two belts are going, I always feel like that - one going towards destruction, one towards construction.

362
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:17,560
You jump from this to the construction side so gradually you move towards construction.

363
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:31,480
- Yes please, yes.
 - [INAUDIBLE] and secondly

364
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:38,720
- [INAUDIBLE]
 - Two questions - how should we meditate

365
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:44,280
and second question, is the Grace of God needed for realization?

366
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:48,260
- Is the Grace of God
 - needed for realization
  - Of course!

367
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:53,940
Without God how can you work out? It's all His work.

368
00:44:55,340 --> 00:45:00,600
And, but you see, if you take the name of God, half people will run away.

369
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:10,100
People don't like that name these days - it's very bad. The One who is our Creator, the One who loves us so much -

370
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:17,620
you don't know Him that's why. When you know Him, you'll know how far away we are away from Him.

371
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:25,060
That's why I take the name of Divine or Divinity because caution. As he said we should take precautions

372
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:33,400
that's why I take precaution not to say. And how to meditate, that I'll tell you little later, all right - that's very good question.

373
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:38,600
Is God and God, nothing else.

00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:12,940
I'll explain. If you're too far to the left or to the right

377
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:17,700
how can you bring yourself to the center without any help?

378

379
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:27,960

I'm sorry sir [UNCLEAR]. Uh..Could you please repeat it again - that the young people and TM

384
00:46:57,660 --> 00:47:02,360
- [UNCLEAR] I was talking about TM and [UNCLEAR] 
 - Ah.. money, sorry

385
00:47:02,580 --> 00:47:06,760
- but I was wondering if the technique [UNCLEAR]

386
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:11,500
- Ah.. You talked about TM
 - Yes, yes
  - they are taking away the money

387
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:15,860
- Annh..
 - Is the technique bad or what is [UNCLEAR]

388
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:22,640
Technique is bad and money is bad and I'm warning you against it, again and again - be careful about it.

389
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:31,200
You'll end up as recluses, you'll be end up with, with some epilepsy, you'll end up with some troubles - I'm warning you before all of you.

390
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:36,680
And if they want they can prosecute Me for that - I can prove it.

391
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:49,380
- Yes
 - [INAUDIBLE]

392
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:53,400
- What?
 - You have said that we are the Spirit
  - hmm.

393
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:59,320
- Is this the re-incarnated Spirit?
 - No, no, no. You see, when I say you are the Spirit,

394
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:06,620
the Spirit is the One that resides in your heart which is the reflection of God Almighty - all right?

395
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:14,400
Now, that is the One who witnesses us, sees us - He's not in our attention, is not in our attention.

396
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:23,140
But when we become the Spirit, He comes in our attention

397
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:31,000
and then what happens, that our attention gets enlightened in the sense that sitting here you can

398
00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:36,900
feel about anyone, what's wrong with this. Like the gentleman asked about TM

399
00:48:37,820 --> 00:48:41,160
Now, he doesn't know whether it is good or bad

400
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:49,560
but if he gets realized immediately he will know how horrible it is because he'll start getting blisters on his fingers.

401

402

[UNCLEAR]

403
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:23,760
Do the herbicides and pesticides and other such chemicals, do they destroy our body?

404
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:29,960
- Which, which?
 - The herbicides, the pesticides that are used in growing of food

405
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:35,560
Yes they, you see, but so, that is true, they do. Now say,

406
00:49:35,980 --> 00:49:42,740
for example, I would say the way we use these uh.. medicines and

407
00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:48,540
pesticides and all those things, they definitely are very strong - no doubt about it

408
00:49:49,060 --> 00:49:56,060
but once you are a realized soul, you can fight them - not so difficult. I would say now, hybrid food itself, you see,

409
00:49:56,300 --> 00:50:03,720
is a very, I don't think is a very good thing to have. Now how we get rid of these pesticides

410
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:09,020
and these things is very simple in India. We have experimented with us, with it

411
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:15,280
and what we have found out very nicely is this, that the

412
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:26,040
when you use your vibrations or you use the vibrated water then

413
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:33,460
if you use it on the non-hybrid seeds, which, which cannot germinate much, then what happens

414
00:50:34,820 --> 00:50:40,440
that, that those things which are non-hybrid

415
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:43,780
produce better results than the hybrid.

416
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:51,680
Now, if you are a realized soul, all right, you use vibrated water or if you go round your

417
00:50:52,060 --> 00:50:56,960
uh.. fields, you don't need pesticides - pests will go away.

418
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:08,060
They just disappear because they understand vibrations. Animals understands vibrations much more than human-beings.

419
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:14,140
Pests, everything that you use for, they just disappear - they don't want to be there.

420
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:23,520
So don't use them and then there is no problem of this remains but many people have to get it.

421
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:30,820
But otherwise also when you are sort of a realized soul, then you're quite strong enough to bear lots of things.

422
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:37,480
You don't get sick very easily unless and until you do something deliberately.

425
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:04,020
- What she's saying?

426
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:08,700
- things today.
 - Achcha
  - So does it damage us even if we're realized?

427
00:52:09,060 --> 00:52:16,820
No, then it does not. If you're realized, then it does not. But so much attention is paid to food in these countries, everybody. I don't think it's

428
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:20,700
so much of a problem that people are talking about.

429
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:28,200
But once you're realized, you're not damaged by anything, anything - it's all these things are very ordinary.

430
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:35,600
There are greater things to fight in this world. Yes, yes madam.

Mother, [INAUDIBLE]

432
00:52:44,540 --> 00:52:52,520
- How do we become realized? Is it just..
 - Haan, that's the thing, that's the thing I'm going to do now. That's good question, that's the thing.

433
00:52:55,920 --> 00:53:03,120
-Yes madam.
 - [INAUDIBLE]
  - Karma?

434
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:09,120
- Does sahaja yoga affect karma?
 - It just sucks your karmas.

435
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:16,160
Karmas are all sucked in. See, what are your karmas come into your pouch of your ego

436
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:23,420
and once the Kundalini rises, She sucks in. Now what is karmas left now because Christ is here, say.

437
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:30,760
I say Christ is here - you take it as a hypothesis. You need not accept Me but is a fact which you can find out later on.

438
00:53:31,060 --> 00:53:35,700
Now the Christ is here. We say Christ died for our sins, don't we say?

439
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:44,920
He died for our sins. If you awaken Christ within your Agnya Chakra, He sucks in all your sins - that's what He does.

440
00:53:46,780 --> 00:53:52,180
But it's an absurd ideas we have about Christianity also that we must

441
00:53:52,420 --> 00:53:58,160
suffer, our body must suffer. Why, He has suffered for us, are you going to suffer more than Him?

442
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:04,380
How much He has suffered!

443
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:11,460
So all the karmas and all that are sucked in -  there are no, you go into akarmas.

444
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:18,500
You're no more there to be the karmas - you're the Spirit now.

00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:27,020
- [INAUDIBLE]
  - No, I think you are finally discommitted to
   - Kya bol raha hai?

453
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:35,280
- He's saying that You talked about evolution
  - Haan
   - and yet about the model

454
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:42,560
what it is just now - do you need to change your system to fit into that aspect of evolution? That's what I could make out.

455
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:48,640
It's rather a confused question, sir. Will you, if you sit down, I'll explain to you.

456
00:55:57,660 --> 00:56:05,660
We have evolved up to human level or say human awareness, right? Our nerves have got a certain

457
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:11,400
dimension of awareness now but we have not reached

458
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:21,300
our destination. And the destination is that we have to become the Spirit.

459
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:25,820
This is the last breakthrough that has to take place.

460
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:30,440
And the whole system works it out.

461
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:38,480
As I explained to you in an egg,

462
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:47,560
the whole egg system works it out and a bird comes out of it.

463
00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:52,980
In the same way this transformation takes place within us.

464
00:56:55,920 --> 00:57:02,920
But you don't feel any working - it's such a slick system; You don't feel anything about it. It's a very beautiful system.

465
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:09,180
You just feel the cool breeze coming out of your head and you feel the cool breeze all around.

466
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:16,180
It's a beautiful system, beautifully made. Even there, Hume has made a mistake, I think,

467
00:57:16,460 --> 00:57:22,300
that he didn't understand that Subconscious and Collective Subconscious all these lie on the left-hand side

468
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:28,120
and the Supraconscious and the Collective  Supraconscious lie on the right hand side and there's a path in between.

469
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:34,500
He just completely mixed up that point otherwise he was quite there.

470
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:38,500
Yes, is there any question?

471
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:49,080
[INAUDIBLE]

472
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:54,300
[INAUDIBLE]

473
00:57:55,680 --> 00:58:02,720
- If a person had a choice 
 - Haan
  - of taking a path which they believe is beneficial to them

474
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:06,900
but they think that that could hurt people who love them

475
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:13,740
Oh, they should take it. You see you must know one thing, we cannot force it on you at all, never.

476
00:58:15,020 --> 00:58:22,840
It has to be asked for. It's a, you see one thing, you cannot force this. God is not going to fall at your feet - no, no.

477
00:58:23,620 --> 00:58:28,060
It's your gain, if you want to have, have it otherwise nothing.

478
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:34,720
Nobody is going to force you, nothing. You have to have complete freedom because if you have to rise to the

479
00:58:35,860 --> 00:58:43,440
entire field of freedom, then you must have your freedom - that's why God gave freedom to human-beings.

480
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:57,680
[INAUDIBLE]

481
00:59:00,940 --> 00:59:07,020
You mentioned that there are many great things that we will have to fight. What are some of these, please?

482
00:59:07,420 --> 00:59:10,940
[SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS] I don't want to frighten you just now.

483
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:19,940
[SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS]

484
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:26,860
All of us together we can fight it. When we are together we can fight it - no problem - but there are.

485
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:42,840
[INAUDIBLE N UNCLEAR] what happens to [UNCLEAR]

486
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:46,600
[UNCLEAR]

487
00:59:47,260 --> 00:59:53,380
- Kya?
 - What happens after you become realized?
  - That I'll tell you tomorrow, na. I said I'll tell you tomorrow.

488
00:59:53,660 --> 00:59:56,660
Annh? Some I've told you, something. Yes please.

489
00:59:59,020 --> 01:00:04,780
- [INAUDIBLE]
 - You don't, can't come tomorrow? You must give some time to your realization

490
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:10,500
It's important. Yes, have you any question?

491
01:00:10,780 --> 01:00:18,760
[INAUDIBLE]

492
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:27,140
[INAUDIBLE]

493
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:35,040
- How do the gurus, false gurus
 - Hnnh
 - uh..manage  to control people

494
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:39,800
because if their own chakras are spoilt, how do they still have the power to do so?

495
01:00:41,020 --> 01:00:48,920
You see they don't, you cannot control people through your chakras, you can never control - actually you never try to control anyone.

496
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:55,960
You enjoy the freedom of another person so if their chakras are spoilt,

497
01:00:58,460 --> 01:01:04,820
what they do is to,  first of all entice people with big, big advertisements

498
01:01:06,420 --> 01:01:10,940
and wrong ideas, talking bombastically about things

499
01:01:11,820 --> 01:01:19,520
and also they have another way of mesmerism - they mesmerize people. There're lots of things they do with the dead.

500
01:01:19,860 --> 01:01:24,340
Also they practice all kinds of hypnotism

501
01:01:24,860 --> 01:01:29,600
uh.. which I have noticed, people are so much enticed, they cannot get over it.

502
01:01:29,940 --> 01:01:33,140
And they try all kinds of dirty tricks.

503
01:01:34,580 --> 01:01:40,940
Many things they do and, I think, they hit upon the weaknesses of people also.

504
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:46,160
Like a guru who is a real guru, will never meet you in privacy

505
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:52,960
but this false one meet you in the privacy and sort of they'll ask you questions in such a manner

506
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:58,720
that you might give away some of your secrets or something. They also blackmail you.

507
01:01:59,140 --> 01:02:05,520
There don't know how they work it out but definitely, they definitely mesmerize you.

508
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:11,440
Also they spoil your chakras uh.. by turning them the other way round.

509
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:19,760
Now this chakra, if somebody turns it the other way round, we can see some sort of a light or a spark coming out of it

510
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:23,700
and you can get completely uh...

511
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:32,620
uh.. enticed by that, completely - you can become a slave of that person, if this chakra is handled the other way round.

512
01:02:35,660 --> 01:02:42,820
So, they also know so many ways; This is called as 'Kali Vidya' in India - that they try all these tricks.

513
01:02:47,780 --> 01:02:54,980
- [INAUDIBLE]
 - Is that sort of a thing happening in Australia?

514
01:02:55,460 --> 01:03:01,720
Yes, I think many people are enticed, have been enticed. Now they have got out of it but still

515
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:09,860
because, you see, this is money orientation - they want to make money out of you so they'll tell you some sort of a mantra, imagine?

516
01:03:10,260 --> 01:03:16,620
Uh.. some people had a mantra called as 'Inga', some had as a 'Thinga'.

517
01:03:16,900 --> 01:03:23,340
Now 'Inga' means the tail of a, tail, in, in ordinary language, not in Sanskrit -

518
01:03:23,580 --> 01:03:28,560
Inga means the tail of a scorpion - imagine, what a mantra!

519
01:03:29,820 --> 01:03:36,120
Or 'Thinga' means when you show like this to somebody to put him down - Thinga.

520
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:41,520
And they were told never to tell anybody, this is very secret, this is coming from Himalayas, somebody's

521
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:47,720
- all sorts of things, you know, and poor naive people from Australia don't know anything about it.

522
01:03:47,940 --> 01:03:54,320
If they tell to Indian, he will laugh and laugh and laugh and jump with laughing - they have be-fooled people like this.

523
01:03:56,120 --> 01:04:04,000
And they make a big ritual about it that you go with this thing, that thing, put so much money here, there and then you get this thing.

524
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:08,580
Seven doors you have to cross to meet the guru, make a big ado out of him

525
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:15,880
and you're enamored. They'll keep Rolls Royces.

526
01:04:16,580 --> 01:04:24,520
I went to Boston and when I wanted to go to their television, they asked Me, "How many Rolls Royces you have?" I said, "I have none."

527
01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:32,360
They said, "We are not interested, if you have no Rolls Royces, we are not interested." Just imagine!

528
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:39,920
It plays, you see, you get the gurus the kind you like, the way you want - isn't it? I should say like that.

529
01:04:40,180 --> 01:04:46,320
You should ask for real gurus, real masters, the ones who will make you meet God.

530
01:04:46,700 --> 01:04:50,360
Nanak Sahab has said, "Guru wahi jo Sahib milihe."

531
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:56,000
The guru is the one who makes you meet the God Almighty - Sahib.

532
01:05:00,180 --> 01:05:06,320
Everybody has said this but the trouble is we do not want to take to somebody who is simple.

533
01:05:10,780 --> 01:05:14,860
This modern types, you see, having horns

534
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:22,520
and all kinds of horrible things - that attracts people.

535
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:30,700
What am I to do? I mean, I just don't know how this psychology has come.

536
01:05:37,340 --> 01:05:40,320
Are you sad still?

537
01:05:41,660 --> 01:05:45,880
- [UNCLEAR] not now.
 - Now, that's better. [SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS]

538
01:05:46,100 --> 01:05:54,080
[UNCLEAR] inside them then there should be no evil.

539
01:05:54,340 --> 01:06:02,440
- There's no?
 - If everybody has [UNCLEAR] inside them there should be no evil.

540
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:06,320
Yes, the evil has to run away.

541
01:06:06,860 --> 01:06:10,660
- [INAUDIBLE]
 - Then we shouldn't worry about them.

542
01:06:11,140 --> 01:06:15,580
[LAUGHTER] Some will remain evil, so it's all right.

543
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:22,940
There isn't, you see, there isn't place in the Kingdom of God for everyone, I must say - evil will not go there.

544
01:06:24,220 --> 01:06:27,980
You see, it's all full now - the seats - you should say.

545
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:32,560
Let them go to Hell, do what they like but they will be very few.

546
01:06:34,020 --> 01:06:41,700
I see there are so many seekers, such beautiful souls in this world, though misguided but there are good people, very many.

547
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:48,520
So many good people could never have existed on this earth, I think -

548
01:06:49,140 --> 01:06:55,200
but they're misguided, that's all. Yes please.

549
01:06:55,920 --> 01:07:03,220
- [INAUDIBLE]
 - What's it, can you stand up?
  - [INAUDIBLE]

550
01:07:04,300 --> 01:07:07,900
- What did he say?
 - What is your opinion about the Hare Krishna's?

551
01:07:08,180 --> 01:07:13,860
Aha, you should find out now what they are up to. You see, this is not the way to go to God.

552
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:19,180
Like mad saying something, 'Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna.' In our country everybody says that.

553
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:23,800
Even the sweeper, when he sweeps, he goes on saying, 'Hare Rama, Hare Krishna.'

554
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:28,480
That's not the way you go to God - it's making fun of God.

555
01:07:33,340 --> 01:07:39,960
- [INAUDIBLE]
 - I'm sorry, the last part could you say it again, please.

556
01:07:40,260 --> 01:07:44,260
- [INAUDIBLE]
 - Kya keh rahe hain?
  - Mujhe bhi nahin sunai de raha.
  - Ain?

557
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:48,600
- Can't hear it. I'm sorry.
  - Loudly, please.

558
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:52,600
Can anyone become Self-realized [INAUDIBLE]?

559
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:58,440
Can anyone become Self-realized and is there anything that can block it from happening?

560
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:04,240
Yes it can, yes can be but you don't worry.

561
01:08:06,780 --> 01:08:12,060
It can block some people, it does. It's all right but ultimately they'll get it.

562
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:18,100
If not today tomorrow, if not tomorrow day after - they'll get it. So far we have not met anyone

563
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:22,320
who hasn't got it, who has been persistent on it, who's felt it.

564
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:29,220
In the beginning people used to take too much time to feel it but nowadays I find most of them feel it very fast.

565
01:08:29,540 --> 01:08:32,800
Yes please, one more question.

566
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:37,180
Two more, all right, now two more and no more.

567
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:40,660
- [INAUDIBLE]
 - What's it?

568
01:08:41,940 --> 01:08:49,100
Mother, [UNCLEAR]

569
01:08:49,480 --> 01:08:53,040
- [UNCLEAR]
 - What's he saying?

570
01:08:53,280 --> 01:09:00,280
You said that you can cure physical problems with sahaja yoga, [UNCLEAR] not just then a physical problem?

571
01:09:00,940 --> 01:09:06,520
Yes, so what? No, no, you see, it, physical also gets cured.

572
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:12,680
You see that's a part of one of the chakras. You see, chakras have got all these things one after another,

573
01:09:12,900 --> 01:09:20,060
so after enlightenment also physical also get's cured. I didn't say only physical - did I? All right?

574
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:29,180
Now, you have asked questions. Should we have those last two, is it all right? All right.

575
01:09:29,500 --> 01:09:33,940
You'll be very much satisfied after some time, I tell you. Now, let's have

576
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:38,260
Who are the two ladies who..? Haan.

577
01:09:38,720 --> 01:09:46,760
[INAUDIBLE]

578
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:55,280
- [INAUDIBLE]
 - Kya keh rahe hain?
  - [INAUDIBLE]

579
01:09:55,580 --> 01:10:02,240
- What she's saying?
 - Why are there so many different rites and ceremonies and not just a simple approach

580
01:10:02,620 --> 01:10:10,620
- to God and realization. Is it right?
 - Yes, it is, it is madam. It is very simple. You're just facing Me, you'll get your realization.

581
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:18,440
But if you want to know the mechanism, then you have to know it that way. You see, mechanism is complicated.

582
01:10:19,180 --> 01:10:27,140
If you don't want to know the mechanism, there is no need. But you want to know the mechanism always, then you have to know all those things - isn't it?

583
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:32,760
Any mechanism is complicated. It's not that complicated also, even children know.

584
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:38,080
If you don't want to use the mechanism, then it's all right.

585
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:44,340
But if you want to be the engineer, then you want to know.

586
01:10:45,180 --> 01:10:51,280
But first you get your realization as I told you just now. There's a history behind it, I already told you that there is

587
01:10:51,500 --> 01:10:57,140
a thing behind it. A mechanism is there. It's not as simple as that, this can be more complicated than that,

588
01:10:57,360 --> 01:11:04,420
can be deeper than that but depends on how far you want to go. If you just want to have your Self-realization, it's all right,

589
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:11,800
but if you want to give realization to others, you have to know all those things - isn't it? Otherwise how will you work it out.

590
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:16,600
All right, what else?

591
01:11:18,380 --> 01:11:23,000
[INAUDIBLE]

592
01:11:23,720 --> 01:11:26,740
- Is there something else?
 - Fate.
 - Faith?

593
01:11:27,880 --> 01:11:32,740
- Fate, yes.
 - Fate. Is there something as fate and can we overcome it with realization?

594
01:11:33,020 --> 01:11:36,520
- Faith?
 - Fate.
 - Of course, of course.

595
01:11:37,060 --> 01:11:41,100
- Fate.
 - Of course.

596
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:50,300
All these things are below the Spirit.

597
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:56,320
You rise, transcend everything. You transcend everything -

598
01:11:57,400 --> 01:12:00,400
that's the mastery I'm talking about.

599
01:12:05,700 --> 01:12:12,940
- Now
 - [INAUDIBLE]

600
01:12:13,220 --> 01:12:16,740
- I think that was asked earlier
 - What she's saying?
- about karma.

601
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:21,980
I've told you already. You people have read a lot, I think.

602
01:12:22,860 --> 01:12:30,580
We have karmas - that's a , that's the thing written before Christ. After Christ whose karmas are left - He's taken away all our karmas.

603
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:34,940
Already He's said it, He has died for us - isn't it?

604
01:12:35,240 --> 01:12:42,800
This was said before, I mean, karma theory was when Krishna was there thousands of years back.

605
01:12:43,220 --> 01:12:49,200
Now Christ has come. See every tree has different different flowers at different times.

606
01:12:50,180 --> 01:12:56,180
So according to timing now, Christ has come, He's talked about, He's taken away the karmas.

607
01:12:56,500 --> 01:13:03,940
Now at this time you have to get your Kundalini awakening - Krishna didn't talk about it, that doesn't mean Kundalini was not there.

608
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:18,240
- Well now, let's have the last.
 - [INAUDIBLE]

609
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:25,960
[INAUDIBLE]

610
01:13:27,060 --> 01:13:33,940
- Yes.
 - How much truth is there in the Bible today as when it was first written

611
01:13:35,160 --> 01:13:38,700
Oh My! It's quite a lot.

612
01:13:39,700 --> 01:13:47,500
You see, despite all the things they tried to hide and despite there was all kinds of

613
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:51,680
disturbances in the Bible, I must say, there's quite a lot.

614
01:13:52,820 --> 01:13:59,940
It's quite a lot but we have to be realized to understand Christ, to understand what He said.

615
01:14:02,180 --> 01:14:08,840
First of all realization must take place otherwise you can't understand - quite a lot - Bible.

616
01:14:10,180 --> 01:14:16,100
Because they didn't know where the truth was hiding so they couldn't remove it, luckily.

617
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:26,520
Yes madam.

618
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:35,000
[UNCLEAR] Bible [UNCLEAR]

619
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:39,480
[UNCLEAR]

620
01:14:39,480 --> 01:14:45,260
[UNCLEAR]

621
01:14:45,820 --> 01:14:50,840
Umm, it is said that there was a secret baptismal right

622
01:14:51,080 --> 01:14:54,640
given by Christ which is been edited out of the Bible

623
01:14:54,920 --> 01:14:59,260
- do You equate this with Self-realization and the awakening of Kundalini?
 - Of course.

624
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:07,400
Of course. Christ must have talked about Kundalini. Today only I was saying, He must have

625
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:15,080
but you see, He was given only three and a half years to talk to people. What can you do in three and a half years - you know it's nothing.

626
01:15:15,320 --> 01:15:21,900
Such a short time? You have no idea that in England I was for four years struggling with seven sahaja yogies.

627
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:28,720
It's not easy in those days

628
01:15:31,620 --> 01:15:38,140
And then His disciples also get very much upset because He was crucified so everybody started asking,

629
01:15:38,380 --> 01:15:43,600
"How was it, if He was God's Son, how was He crucified?" That was His job, He had to do that.

630
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:52,380
He had to pass through this, through His crucifixion. All is explained in sahaja yoga -

631
01:15:52,720 --> 01:15:57,800
Christ's life, Mohammad's life, Rama's life, Krishna's life - everything is

632
01:15:58,060 --> 01:16:02,600
absolutely explained and you can see for yourself that They are all one.

633
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:08,080
Christ Himself has said, "Those who are not against are with Me." Who are those?

634
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:17,020
But we are not allowed to see anything else, just like uh.. horses we have

635
01:16:17,240 --> 01:16:24,980
blinkers - we can't see anything else. If you want to know about Christ, better read Devi Mahaatma - is all described much better.

636
01:16:33,260 --> 01:16:37,000
That's why Christianity can be very fanatical, I can tell you,

637
01:16:37,380 --> 01:16:40,300
because you see, the blinkers are here - you can't see anything.

638
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:44,620
You can't read Gita, you can't read anything, you see, going anywhere else

639
01:16:44,820 --> 01:16:49,300
means you are a non-Christian - such a organized thing.

640
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:53,520
But open your eyes and see for yourself.

641
01:16:58,320 --> 01:17:04,920
Such a great personality like Christ - you see, Onkara Himself incarnated as Christ.

642
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:14,100
They have made such a mess out of it, I tell you. Who can believe in Christ when they say what Christianity is?

643
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:22,600
Such a mess! Same about, I would say, Hinduism, same about Islam, every religion is the same style.

644
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:29,160
It's same style, there's nothing to choose.

645
01:17:31,640 --> 01:17:34,640
All have gone wrong.

646
01:17:40,500 --> 01:17:46,640
In the name of God wars, in the name of God money,

647
01:17:47,900 --> 01:17:54,180
in the name of God enjoying women, lust and greed

648
01:17:54,600 --> 01:17:59,420
while Christ has said, "Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes."

649
01:18:01,620 --> 01:18:04,660
because He rules the eyes.

650
01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:14,680
You'll understand what Christ is once you're realized.

651
01:18:23,620 --> 01:18:26,680
Yes, now still [UNCLEAR]

652
01:18:27,260 --> 01:18:34,580
[UNCLEAR]

653
01:18:35,380 --> 01:18:41,040
Is there such a  thing as people not being ready for Self-realization, in this lifetime?

654
01:18:41,560 --> 01:18:49,280
I don't think, I don't say that. I think all of them are there for realization.

655
01:18:51,620 --> 01:18:56,800
Everybody can get realization but if you're identified with nonsense

656
01:18:58,360 --> 01:19:02,440
If you put your foot in the crocodile's mouth

657
01:19:03,060 --> 01:19:07,620
and one foot on the boat, what are we to do?

658
01:19:10,660 --> 01:19:18,380
There's a blossom time, is a special Resurrection time - this is the time of judgment, has to happen.

659
01:19:19,580 --> 01:19:27,440
Everybody must get their chance. God is justice, He's fair.

660
01:19:36,340 --> 01:19:42,220
Now, still going on, all right. Ask one question, now let it be the last - all right?

661
01:19:43,860 --> 01:19:49,940
[UNCLEAR - BECAUSE?]There are so many who are anxious to get realization, madam. Now come along. What's your question, special one?

662
01:19:50,360 --> 01:19:54,980
[INAUDIBLE]

663
01:19:55,240 --> 01:19:59,160
- [UNCLEAR] kya?
 - I'm sorry, if you could just

664
01:20:00,180 --> 01:20:06,960
- [INAUDIBLE N UNCLEAR] immortality.
 - Will You tell us about immortality?

665
01:20:07,180 --> 01:20:13,740
- [INAUDIBLE]
 - Through Self-realization will we know the immortal?

666
01:20:14,220 --> 01:20:17,400
- What we know?
 - The immortal.
 - Of course.

667
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:20,660
- [INAUDIBLE]
 - Of course
  - Will we know

668
01:20:21,220 --> 01:20:27,400
The Immortal, that's the Spirit. That's what I'm saying - that's the Spirit.

669
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:36,460
All right, so let's have it now. All the questions are over.

670
01:20:42,280 --> 01:20:49,780
Now, first of all we have to understand little cooperation is needed

671
01:20:50,940 --> 01:20:56,440
raising the Kundalini. If you could just take out the shoes -

672
01:20:57,140 --> 01:21:02,660
this Mother Earth helps Me a lot and will help you a lot - just take out your shoes - simple thing.

673
01:21:02,940 --> 01:21:09,060
Taking out shoe is not difficult - is it? All right.

674
01:21:09,680 --> 01:21:16,680
And if you can put your feet on the Mother Earth. Now those who don't want to do, should go out; Should not disturb us.

675
01:21:17,260 --> 01:21:23,220
I'll be thankful - those who don't want to do it should go away. It is absolutely your freedom

676
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:30,340
and it hardly takes about five to ten minutes - much less than your questioning.

677
01:21:34,680 --> 01:21:37,620
All right.

678
01:21:39,620 --> 01:21:45,700
Now both the feet on the ground separately because these are two powers, as I told you, the left and the right.

679
01:21:48,160 --> 01:21:56,040
This should not be mixed up. Now left hand is towards Me because this is the desire you have

680
01:21:58,680 --> 01:22:05,280
that you want to have your realization. You can keep it comfortably on your lap, if you want to - be comfortable.

681
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:10,320
You need not put your neck very tight or very low - just in the center.

682
01:22:10,780 --> 01:22:16,800
With the right hand I will tell you how you will raise your own Kundalini - very simple.

683
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:24,380
First of all, I'll tell you and then you'll have to close your eyes and do it. First of all you'll have to put it on your heart

684
01:22:25,460 --> 01:22:31,860
just like this. Now in the heart resides - all of you should do it on the heart. On the heart resides

685
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:36,860
the Spirit - all right? Please do it , sir, please.You don't want to do it?

686
01:22:39,080 --> 01:22:44,940
What's the matter? [ SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS] He's got it already, I think. [ SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS]

687
01:22:45,220 --> 01:22:49,540
He's in thoughtless awareness. Now put it, your right hand, on the heart.

688
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:55,060
And here heart, in the heart resides the Spirit.

689
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:04,900
Below that is the center here, is of principle of mastery

690
01:23:05,440 --> 01:23:10,780
or guidance or guru or ten commandments - on the left-hand side.

691
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:25,180
Now below that is another center, down here, below on the left-hand side. Everything works on the left-hand side

692
01:23:30,740 --> 01:23:37,440
below in the lower part of the abdomen. On the left-hand side is the center through which all the Divine laws work.

693
01:23:41,460 --> 01:23:47,040
So, then again we go up on the upper part of the stomach on the left-hand side.

694
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:54,960
Then we go to the heart again. Now here we go

695
01:23:59,900 --> 01:24:06,700
in the corner between the neck and your shoulder and turn your head to the right -

696
01:24:06,980 --> 01:24:14,180
is very simple, like that. But don't take your hand from the back - just from here, from the front. Hold it tight.

697
01:24:16,260 --> 01:24:23,260
This is the main center that catches because you feel guilty for nothing at all. That's a fashion nowadays to feel guilty.

698
01:24:23,780 --> 01:24:31,160
Now don't feel guilty. You have come at the door

699
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:37,560
of God's Kingdom so be pleasantly placed towards yourself and forgive yourself.

700
01:24:38,260 --> 01:24:42,360
Don't feel guilty at all, be happy. Now,

701
01:24:43,300 --> 01:24:51,200
put your hand on top of your head in such a manner, I [UNCLEAR- MEAN?} on, on your forehead

702
01:24:51,900 --> 01:24:59,720
and press it on both the sides in such a manner as you press it when you have headaches. Press it slowly.

703
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:06,140
Then take this hand on the back side of your head and put the

704
01:25:09,140 --> 01:25:13,540
load of your head on that hand, like this,

705
01:25:14,780 --> 01:25:21,040
slowly. Now bring this hand and stretch it nicely.

706
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:30,280
The center of this palm you put it on the fontanel bone area, which was a soft bone in your childhood.

707
01:25:31,400 --> 01:25:38,200
Now, move it seven times - the scalp - keeping the fingers out.

708
01:25:38,540 --> 01:25:42,920
Move it seven times putting the left hand towards Me -

709
01:25:43,360 --> 01:25:47,120
slowly, seven times. Now.

710
01:25:58,360 --> 01:26:02,160
Now first of all, you're not to feel guilty.

711
01:26:02,700 --> 01:26:07,560
You should be pleasantly placed towards yourself in a very happy mood.

712
01:26:09,280 --> 01:26:13,740
You shouldn't say, "I've done this wrong, that wrong," nothing of the kind.

713
01:26:15,060 --> 01:26:20,520
Now, close your eyes. Even you can take out your spectacles if you want

714
01:26:20,820 --> 01:26:25,560
because sometimes the eyesight gets better. So, close your eyes

715
01:26:26,240 --> 01:26:30,680
Put your left hand towards Me and right hand on the heart.

716
01:26:32,240 --> 01:26:39,060
In the heart resides the Spirit so ask Me a fundamental question -

717
01:26:40,480 --> 01:26:44,440
you can call Me Shri Mataji or Mother, whichever way you like.

718
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:51,500
"Mother, am I the Spirit?" Ask this question in your heart three times,

719
01:26:52,020 --> 01:26:55,100
"Mother, am I the Spirit?"

720
01:26:56,140 --> 01:27:03,580
Please put both your hands, feet together. You don't want to do it, madam?

721
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:25,600
Ask this question. Now, bring that hand on the left-hand side

722
01:27:26,120 --> 01:27:31,180
of the upper part of the abdomen of the stomach, press it and here

723
01:27:31,440 --> 01:27:37,280
you have to ask another question because if you are the Spirit, you are your master also.

724
01:27:38,020 --> 01:27:41,840
Ask Me a question, "Mother, am I my own master?"

725
01:27:45,800 --> 01:27:48,860
Three times please.

726
01:28:02,980 --> 01:28:07,880
Now, take down this hand, down below.

727
01:28:09,280 --> 01:28:15,120
Again on the left-hand side in the lower part of your abdomen and press it hard.

728
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:21,660
Now this is the center of pure knowledge or the laws

729
01:28:23,440 --> 01:28:30,400
that are Divine. So you press it hard and please

730
01:28:30,740 --> 01:28:36,800
say six times because there are six petals to this center.

731
01:28:37,720 --> 01:28:43,300
"Mother, may I have the pure knowledge?"

732
01:28:43,660 --> 01:28:48,760
I cannot force so you have to ask for it. So ask for it,

733
01:28:49,060 --> 01:28:56,580
"Mother, please may I have the pure knowledge of the truth?"

734
01:29:00,660 --> 01:29:04,520
Six times, ask from your heart.

735
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:20,120
Now, take this hand upwards,

736
01:29:21,020 --> 01:29:26,280
press it on the upper part of the abdomen on the left-hand side

737
01:29:26,860 --> 01:29:32,260
and here ask for ten, ten times, ten times

738
01:29:34,180 --> 01:29:42,000
or here you can say, here you have to help the Kundalini. You have to help the Kundalini,

739
01:29:42,920 --> 01:29:49,340
to co-ordinate with Her because She has started moving now. As soon as you asked

740
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:57,160
for pure knowledge, She started moving. So here you put your hand and press it hard and ask

741
01:29:57,740 --> 01:30:02,940
or you can say it just to support the Kundalini,

742
01:30:03,560 --> 01:30:09,340
"Mother, I am my own master."

743
01:30:12,080 --> 01:30:17,100
"Mother, I am my own master," say it ten times please.

744
01:30:27,400 --> 01:30:30,760
Now, ten times.

745
01:30:34,860 --> 01:30:42,300
With full confidence, without any guilt, without anything, "I am my own master," you have to support the Kundalini.

746
01:30:45,820 --> 01:30:48,840
Now.

747
01:31:06,280 --> 01:31:13,640
Now raise your hand to your heart. Here again to support your Kundalini to rise,

748
01:31:13,980 --> 01:31:19,080
to co-operate with  Her, with full confidence you have to see the greatest truth

749
01:31:19,500 --> 01:31:23,320
lies within you that, "Mother,

750
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:29,200
I am the Spirit. Mother, I am the spirit."

751
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:36,080
Please say it twelve times. "I am the Spirit," please say it ten times, with full confidence.

752
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:12,800
You have to know that God almighty is the ocean

753
01:32:13,200 --> 01:32:18,820
of love and Grace but above all

754
01:32:20,180 --> 01:32:26,480
He is the ocean of forgiveness, He is the ocean of forgiveness

755
01:32:27,120 --> 01:32:33,900
and He forgives whatever we do. After all human-beings have to commit mistakes - there's nothing wrong in it.

756
01:32:37,940 --> 01:32:43,500
No need to be angry with yourself at all. Please raise your right hand

757
01:32:45,960 --> 01:32:53,600
on your shoulder in the corner between the neck and the shoulder.

758
01:32:56,360 --> 01:33:03,980
And here press it hard and you say with full confidence sixteen times,

759
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:11,020
"Mother, I'm not guilty." Please say it sixteen times, turn your head to the right.

760
01:33:11,960 --> 01:33:16,920
Please turn your head to the right and say,"Mother, I am not guilty at all."

761
01:33:30,320 --> 01:33:35,040
Please say, "Mother, I'm not guilty at all," sixteen times.

762
01:33:42,880 --> 01:33:45,900
Now,

763
01:33:55,320 --> 01:34:00,600
please put your right hand

764
01:34:02,600 --> 01:34:09,800
on your forehead across, press it on both the sides.

765
01:34:11,320 --> 01:34:19,220
Here, from your heart you have to say, how many times is not the point,

766
01:34:21,200 --> 01:34:26,960
from your heart you have to say, "Mother, I forgive everyone

767
01:34:29,140 --> 01:34:33,340
Now many people think that's very difficult to forgive

768
01:34:33,780 --> 01:34:38,380
but actually, we do not do anything whether you forgive or we do not forgive.

769
01:34:38,900 --> 01:34:42,420
But if we do not forgive, then we play into wrong hands

770
01:34:42,720 --> 01:34:46,800
so say it from your heart, "Mother, I forgive everyone."

771
01:34:57,740 --> 01:35:02,660
Now, take this hand on the back side, put your head

772
01:35:05,500 --> 01:35:11,900
on it and turn it upward - let it rest on the hand.

773
01:35:13,140 --> 01:35:18,420
Here for your own satisfaction, you may say, "Oh Divine,

774
01:35:18,920 --> 01:35:25,560
please forgive me if any mistakes I have made." This is only for your own satisfaction I'm saying.

775
01:35:25,800 --> 01:35:30,640
Now don't count your mistakes, please don't count your mistakes.

776
01:35:32,780 --> 01:35:36,660
You have to be very loving and sweet towards yourself.

777
01:35:48,660 --> 01:35:54,720
Now, stretch your hand, please, fully.

778
01:35:57,480 --> 01:36:02,240
Put your center of your palm, please, on

779
01:36:02,500 --> 01:36:08,980
the fontanel bone area and press it very hard and move it, very slowly, seven times.

780
01:36:09,500 --> 01:36:16,380
Here again you have to ask for your realization, so say, "Mother, please give me my Self-realization."

781
01:36:17,200 --> 01:36:23,340
Say seven times - I can't force it on you, I'm sorry - seven times.

Now, take down your hand, please. Slowly open your eyes, slowly.

Left hand on top of your head, left hand. Right hand towards Me.

793
01:37:22,280 --> 01:37:26,300
Now see, if there's a cool breeze coming. Now move up and down and see for yourself.

794
01:37:31,320 --> 01:37:34,300
All right?

795
01:37:37,300 --> 01:37:43,140
Feeling it? Little, some people get it that point, some get it very high.

796
01:37:44,420 --> 01:37:52,300
Little bit higher. Don't doubt yourself, please don't doubt yourself.

Now, put the left hand towards Me and see with the right hand.

01:38:00,280 --> 01:38:05,520
Some might be getting hot, doesn't matter. Hot will become cool very soon.

799
01:38:08,820 --> 01:38:13,540
You can bend your head and see for yourself, it'll be better and easier.

800
01:38:23,040 --> 01:38:28,340
Now, put the right hand again towards Me and with the left hand

801
01:38:48,900 --> 01:38:53,760
All right? Now, put both the hands towards the sky

802
01:38:55,480 --> 01:39:02,340
and ask a question three times, "Is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost that is the Kundalini?"

803
01:39:03,260 --> 01:39:10,140
"Is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost? Is this the Brahma Chaitanya?"

804
01:39:11,860 --> 01:39:18,780
"Is this the love of God that is All-Pervading Power?" You ask any one of these, three times.

805
01:39:28,580 --> 01:39:32,080
All right, now we can keep it down.

806
01:39:34,240 --> 01:39:39,260
Now, let us see how many of you have got it on top of your head

Quite a lot of people. You got it now - good. So, no questions tomorrow. Ha

811
01:40:08,060 --> 01:40:14,840
Good. May God bless you! Quite a lot of people have got it, some people haven't got it I must say.

812
01:40:15,800 --> 01:40:23,700
Ah! Sydney was better in a way. But I think we spent too much time in questioning that's how people [UNCLEAR] loose their

813
01:40:24,080 --> 01:40:31,080
uh.. attention a little bit - doesn't matter. If it has not worked out it will work out tomorrow in any case.

814
01:40:31,760 --> 01:40:38,860
And I'll be here again to meet you and to greet you and I'll explain to you all the rest of things.

815
01:40:39,280 --> 01:40:45,600
Those who haven't got it, if you're anxious or to get it, I think, you could,

816
01:40:46,240 --> 01:40:53,460
they can come down here and can work it on certain people - a big row of people didn't get here in the center.

817
01:40:53,780 --> 01:41:00,960
If you can see, some of you people, uh.. those, these two persons should get it - I don't know why they didn't - you didn't feel it?

818
01:41:01,300 --> 01:41:06,860
Sure? I think you did feel, madam. You felt it? You felt it?

819
01:41:07,240 --> 01:41:14,860
Good. You can feel each other, you can feel each other's head, yes. What about you - no? What about you - you got it? Got it.

820
01:41:15,280 --> 01:41:22,340
Most of them have but in the third row or fourth row there are people. Who have not felt it, please?

821
01:41:22,840 --> 01:41:28,280
Ah, do you mind uh.. seeing them or what should we do?

822
01:41:31,220 --> 01:41:35,020
You also will be having a workshop later on.

823
01:41:35,860 --> 01:41:43,340
Just see, your neighbors, you see from your neighbors, should see. This gentleman - can you see on his head, he hasn't got it?

824
01:41:43,620 --> 01:41:48,360
You put your hands. You said you didn't get it. Just see this gentleman why he hasn't got it?

825
01:41:49,560 --> 01:41:53,560
Hello, some sahaja yogi should see some of these people.

826
01:41:55,440 --> 01:42:01,580
Third person, that fourth person. No, she never tried. She was just sitting there tight.

827
01:42:07,140 --> 01:42:10,180
Maybe in the hands but

828
01:42:16,040 --> 01:42:19,060
He's got it - you've got it?

829
01:42:20,440 --> 01:42:25,800
Now he's felt it, now he's felt it. You see, it's one of the sahaja yogies puts the hand also, they'll feel it.

830
01:42:26,100 --> 01:42:29,320
Those who haven't put in the first row, raise your hands, please?

831
01:42:30,520 --> 01:42:35,160
Ah, just see this gentleman, just one minute they can work it out, ah..

Raise it, raise it. Today I've worked very hard, I think, she, they should.

835
01:43:07,640 --> 01:43:15,240
Now you felt it, all right. Now, can we have some more sahaja yogies to work out here? Just see.

836
01:43:20,380 --> 01:43:25,540
You didn't feel that, none of you - did you feel?

837
01:43:28,700 --> 01:43:34,640
What of the boy who was feeling sad? Just see, did he feel, did he feel the cool breeze?

838
01:43:35,960 --> 01:43:43,040
The second number there with the yellow, this thing. He's felt it. Now, you've got it.

839
01:43:43,480 --> 01:43:49,400
Now you have to give joy to everyone - all right? He's got it, good.

840
01:43:50,200 --> 01:43:56,480
This lady is here, just see. Take one or two persons who haven't felt it and who are desire. No?

841
01:44:30,500 --> 01:44:35,700
Hmm, better. He's got it, has he?

842
01:44:39,180 --> 01:44:43,760
- Got it.Is he feeling it?
 - [UNCLEAR]
 - His falls down?

843
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:50,220
- [INAUDIBLE]
 - Ask him for his guru or someone must be there. He had some guru?

844
01:44:53,560 --> 01:44:59,920
- [INAUDIBLE]
 - Now he's feeling it.

845
01:45:00,720 --> 01:45:08,760
[SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS] With the slightest here and there it just loops down in a funny way.

846
01:45:10,340 --> 01:45:16,980
Where are the sahaj yogies gone? Come along. Just see this lady is here, she wants to have her realization. Didn't feel it?

847
01:45:17,740 --> 01:45:20,700
- You did not feel?
 -[INAUDIBLE] 
 - All right

848
01:45:20,920 --> 01:45:23,980
- [INAUDIBLE]
 - Yes.

849
01:45:28,020 --> 01:45:32,260
Now you must inform your friends and bring them along tomorrow.

Hmm, better.

851
01:45:48,660 --> 01:45:56,120
I think in the second row, [UNCLEAR] in the third row. What about the gentleman who asked about precautions. Did you feel the cool breeze?

852
01:45:57,980 --> 01:46:00,920
The gentleman in the fourth row.

853
01:46:03,220 --> 01:46:09,020
Aey Rustom, fourth row mein dekho na, woh jo precautions ki baat kari.

 - It's difficult to get in the seats  because they're
 - Unnh?
  - so close.

- It's difficult to get in between the seats, the way
- Yes
 - they're designed they're too close.

You want to say something - come here. No you. Saying something to Me?

01:50:13,420 --> 01:50:16,460
No, it's all right.

I'd like to meet them if they want. Come along! Haan.

Work very hard? Ah, that's why. They'll tell you all about it. It's all right.

888
01:54:48,040 --> 01:54:53,560
Better? It's too much working hard, that's all.

893

Watch the spark in the eyes!

And get some more people now. This is the thing. You invite for dinners and this and that. Better invite them for this.

897
01:56:54,040 --> 01:57:00,340
All right? That's the greatest thing to be given. How are you, all right?

898

906
01:57:55,740 --> 01:58:02,480
Does not want to accept that. You're accepting but she was frightened.

No, no, no, forget all that. [UNCLEAR] sahaja yoga, why should you [INAUDIBLE].

923
02:00:52,340 --> 02:00:58,500
You just say that, "Mother, I am my own master - ten times." Forget all these things. Just see

924
02:00:58,820 --> 02:01:03,380
how much you're perspiring. If that book was good you would not perspire before Me.

925
02:01:03,780 --> 02:01:09,440
Haan say, "Mother, I am my own master."

 - Again
 - I am my own master, I am my own master.

927
02:01:18,900 --> 02:01:22,200
All right? Just don't read all this nonsense.

928
02:01:30,540 --> 02:01:33,760
Forgive, forgive everyone

 - You need to travel. [UNCLEAR]

949
02:05:57,420 --> 02:06:06,760
[UNCLEAR] For realization [INAUDIBLE] for travel [INAUDIBLE]

950
02:06:42,700 --> 02:06:49,460
Why do they want to come? If they're realized souls, be satisfied. If they're realized souls, what work are they doing?

951
02:06:50,240 --> 02:06:55,500
[UNCLEAR] must have your own money

952
02:07:13,720 --> 02:07:18,900
Forgive, forgive everyone.

953
02:07:21,180 --> 02:07:28,760
All right? You can't even think how can you [INAUDIBLE]

954
02:08:10,320 --> 02:08:17,640
Very pleased to meet you. How are you? Yes of course and call all your friends.

Tomorrow, come tomorrow. Yes tomorrow, tomorrow. Yes tomorrow. May God bless you!

956
02:08:30,380 --> 02:08:35,080
Did you work out on that boy? Got it. Doubt [UNCLEAR]

957
02:08:37,820 --> 02:08:45,700
No, nothing worked out. [UNCLEAR] Just see. You're doubting Me?

958
02:08:45,940 --> 02:08:50,960
- [INAUDIBLE]
 - Annh?
 - Yes, haan bol raha hai.

959
02:08:58,100 --> 02:09:05,760
[SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS] Despite doubting it has worked, you see. You must have been a seeker in your last life.

960
02:09:06,080 --> 02:09:16,080
- Are you a seeker this life also?
 - Yes [UNCLEAR]
 - [UNCLEAR] You got it, you see your fingers [UNCLEAR] Worked

961
02:09:18,980 --> 02:09:23,980
Be happy that you found it, all right? You don't feel cool breeze?

962
02:09:25,020 --> 02:09:29,260
What to [ INAUDIBLE]

963
02:09:29,540 --> 02:09:32,720
Annh? Just know it.

964
02:09:36,720 --> 02:09:41,240
Not from the head. Vishudhdhi is

965
02:09:47,460 --> 02:09:53,980
Not yet. It is on the head. You can't feel it because, you see, your Vishudhdhi, this is purely blocked

966
02:09:54,260 --> 02:09:58,780
with lot of [INAUDIBLE]. Once it is

967
02:10:25,020 --> 02:10:30,440
No, no, no. No need to [INAUDIBLE] No, no, no, go and eat everything

968
02:10:30,700 --> 02:10:37,740
[UNCLEAR] No, no, no. No use. No need to do all that.

969
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:43,500
- Hello Dadi!
 - Hello!

970
02:10:43,920 --> 02:10:50,040
Vishudhdhi is very bad. Somebody has to settle his Vishudhdhi. You come along tomorrow, all right? You'll get it.

971
02:10:52,040 --> 02:10:57,500
should set. You're Australia, Australian out and out.

972
02:10:57,780 --> 02:11:05,460
- My parents are Dutch.
- Your parents are Dutch? All right. Come along. Makes no difference.

973
02:11:17,480 --> 02:11:24,380
- [INAUDIBLE]
 - Haan, it's better.
 - Feels nothing [INAUDIBLE]

974
02:11:24,720 --> 02:11:29,780
- What is happened to her hands?
 - [INAUDIBLE]
 - In the hands what's happened?

975
02:11:31,460 --> 02:11:38,340
Dying? Left.

976
02:11:43,860 --> 02:11:49,160
- The disease of the nerves.
 - I know, I know.
 - The nervous system

977
02:11:49,480 --> 02:11:52,600
- Where's he [UNCLEAR], where's he

978
02:11:52,840 --> 02:12:00,140
No, no, no, there's nothing like that,
 you see, [INAUDIBLE] Raise his Kundalini, he's quite all right.

979
02:12:01,600 --> 02:12:07,740
- You take off your shoes.[UNCLEAR]

980
02:12:17,820 --> 02:12:20,840
[HAAN]

981
02:12:31,160 --> 02:12:34,160
Ask him to ask the question of the Holy Ghost.

982
02:12:35,960 --> 02:12:43,280
- Ask the question, "Is She the Holy Ghost?"
 - Again [UNCLEAR - TIGHTER?]
 - Are you the Holy Ghost?Are you the Holy Ghost? Are you the Holy Ghost?

983
02:12:43,540 --> 02:12:51,540
- Again, "Mother, are you the Holy Ghost?"
 - Are you the Holy Ghost? Are you the Holy Ghost? Are you the Holy Ghost?

984
02:12:52,340 --> 02:12:59,680
All right, the cool breeze coming? Feeling the cool breeze? Tie it up on the head, tie it up.

985
02:13:00,940 --> 02:13:04,320
They're not shaking anymore.

986
02:13:07,920 --> 02:13:14,760
- Annh? All right?
 - So, he feels the cool.
 - All right. You say, "Mother, You are the Holy Ghost."
 - You are the Holy Ghost.

987
02:13:15,020 --> 02:13:20,780
- "Mother, You are the Holy Ghost."
 - "Mother, You are the Holy Ghost."
 - Again.
 -  "Mother, You are the Holy Ghost."

988
02:13:21,100 --> 02:13:26,400
- Again.
 - Mother, You are the Holy Ghost.
 - Again.
 - Mother, You are the Holy Ghost.

989
02:13:26,660 --> 02:13:34,160
So, you got it - your realization, sir. You're all right, nothing wrong with you. So, your hands are all right.

990
02:13:35,280 --> 02:13:43,000
- All right. Now.
 - Should practice sahaja now. You find that it will
 - You must practice sahaja but he's all right, he's all right

991
02:13:43,320 --> 02:13:51,060
- [UNCLEAR] spinal. Kundalini [UNCLEAR] that's all. Doctors give big, big names. Hands are [UNCLEAR]

992
02:13:51,300 --> 02:13:58,880
- Mother
 - Yes
 - [UNCLEAR]
 - Jai Shri Mataji!

993
02:13:59,120 --> 02:14:06,340
- [UNCLEAR]
 - What's the problem?
- Asthma.
- Asthma. Yes. He's your, you are the father?

994
02:14:06,680 --> 02:14:13,140
- Yes.
 - All right.
 - [UNCLEAR]
 -  Will you sit down somewhere?

995
02:14:13,980 --> 02:14:18,340
- Take out this, all right? Come.

996
02:14:23,840 --> 02:14:30,880
- What's your relationship with him, is it good?
 - [UNCLEAR - DIFFERENT LANGUAGE?]

997
02:14:31,140 --> 02:14:37,880
- What's it? Is it the best relationship?
 - Probably not.
 - No.
 - No, not calling it best.

998
02:14:38,100 --> 02:14:44,320
- [UNCLEAR]
 - How's your father?
 - [UNCLEAR] had a problem.
 - [UNCLEAR]

999
02:14:44,540 --> 02:14:49,820
- [UNCLEAR]
 - Annh? When he gets angry with you? 
 - Oh, he gets, he smacks me
- Annh?

1000
02:14:50,080 --> 02:14:56,960
- Correction, correction yes. No, not [UNCLEAR]
- Beg your pardon.
- Just no more.

1001
02:14:57,240 --> 02:15:05,560
- [UNCLEAR - CORRECTION?]
 - Come this side, come this side. I'd come on this one.

1002
02:15:05,780 --> 02:15:12,500
- Come this side. Sit on this
 - I'm not patient.

1003
02:15:16,680 --> 02:15:23,540
- Put your hands up and [UNCLEAR]
 - You must forgive. You're angry with your father sometimes?

1004
02:15:23,780 --> 02:15:27,540
- Yes.
 - Annh?
 - [UNCLEAR - AM I BEATING?]

1005
02:15:27,840 --> 02:15:32,880
- Just tell Me,
 - Very difficult.
 - I can beat him, all right? [LAUGHTER]

1006
02:15:33,140 --> 02:15:39,160
- He's very strong.
 - Tell Me what's the matter, what does he do? Hmm.

1007
02:15:41,120 --> 02:15:44,600
- He gets angry with you very much?
 - Sometimes.
 - Annh?

1008
02:15:44,820 --> 02:15:51,620
- [UNCLEAR] My patience is short. 
 - Yes
 - My patience is short [UNCLEAR] more trouble

1009
02:15:52,920 --> 02:15:59,060
He says his patience, short of patience that's why this problem. He says he very short on patience.

1010
02:15:59,280 --> 02:16:03,260
- Did you get your realization? Did you feel the cool breeze?
 - On my hand - yes.

1011
02:16:03,480 --> 02:16:09,020
- Haan, yes. On your head?
 - No, I've never have been  [UNCLEAR]

1012
02:16:09,680 --> 02:16:13,740
- [UNCLEAR]
 - Just see on his head.
 - [UNCLEAR] A couple of years
 - Annh?

1013
02:16:13,960 --> 02:16:18,460
- No, just couple of months. Maybe [UNCLEAR]

1014
02:16:18,760 --> 02:16:24,660
You must forgive your father, annh. Father's have right to get angry with [UNCLEAR - THEIR CHILDREN?], all right?

1015
02:16:24,920 --> 02:16:27,960
Haan. Now, you forgive your father.

1016
02:16:31,840 --> 02:16:37,500
- Now, breathe, breathe in..
 - Vishudhdhi [UNCLEAR] each other too

1017
02:16:37,780 --> 02:16:40,920
- Leave it.
 -  Slow down, just slow down for some, then you
 - Again breathe in

1018
02:16:41,140 --> 02:16:48,040
-  have a chance to get together.
 - Yes.
 - [UNCLEAR] If you're busy all the time
 - [UNCLEAR] on each other's ego

1019
02:16:48,260 --> 02:16:53,660
- Again breathe in
 - [UNCLEAR] center heart and that's because [UNCLEAR] clean

1020
02:16:53,880 --> 02:17:01,240
- Did you hear - breathing? Did you not?
 - Yes

1021
02:17:01,900 --> 02:17:08,240
Really? He's all right. And what you do - you take some ice

1022
02:17:09,360 --> 02:17:17,120
in the daytime and put it on his liver, here. All right? He's all right. He's all right now, feel the cool breeze?

1023
02:17:18,420 --> 02:17:23,620
On your heads - yes?

1024
02:17:23,960 --> 02:17:32,220
- All right. You're feeling
 - Hot
 - Annh, hot - liver.  You see, it's liver. This liver gives the heat and that's why they get this.

1025
02:17:32,500 --> 02:17:40,220
But you see the liver also gets heated up because of anger and the anger that's suppressed. So what happens, with the father, anger is suppressed

1026
02:17:40,560 --> 02:17:48,740
and then the liver becomes heated up so put some ice there. Let him also put some ice - you'll have more patience - on the liver, there - here.

1027
02:17:49,500 --> 02:17:54,220
Put your hand there, just put that hand there. Now put it.

1028
02:17:55,480 --> 02:18:02,940
You're better now - breathing is good? Your breathing is good now? Breathe, let's see.

1029
02:18:04,800 --> 02:18:10,880
- All right?
 - Yes.
 - Breathing all right, normal? Still asthma, asthma you feel?

1030
02:18:11,240 --> 02:18:19,080
- Rustom ko bulao. Annh?
 - [UNCLEAR] He's okay [UNCLEAR]
  - Then put ice here, that's all - on his liver.

1031
02:18:19,320 --> 02:18:26,800
- Now you're all right? How do you feel, are you feeling all right?
 - Yes.
 - Annh?
 - Yes

1032
02:18:27,520 --> 02:18:31,120
- Breathing is all right?
 - Yes
 - Good.

1033
02:18:31,520 --> 02:18:38,620
- Better now, are you? Better forgive. What about his mother?

1034
02:18:47,720 --> 02:18:54,280
Forgive, forgive everyone, forgive, forgive. See in here,

1035
02:18:54,800 --> 02:19:01,420
the Western countries we try to regularize children too much in childhood, too much. Don't do this, don't spoil the carpet, don't spoil that

1036
02:19:01,660 --> 02:19:08,560
- carpet is more important than the child. Then they become what - hippies. They become hippies then.

1037
02:19:09,720 --> 02:19:16,680
- They revolt
 - They revolt against the [UNCLEAR]
 - Yes
 - because we don't do that to our children in India.

1038
02:19:16,920 --> 02:19:22,100
- No, we allow them to play, after all they're children.
 - That's right
 - He's very calm

1039
02:19:22,480 --> 02:19:29,060
- You're better?
- Hmm
 - Better? Breathing is better now? How is your breathing? Breathing is all right now

1040
02:19:29,280 --> 02:19:36,320
- Breathing is all right, are you breathing all right - annh?
 - Yes

1041
02:19:36,520 --> 02:19:43,360
- Can you hear Me?
- Yes.
 - Can you hear clearly? Whatever I am saying do you hear Me?
 - Yes.

1042
02:19:43,580 --> 02:19:48,360
- Do you hear Me clearly?
 - Somewhat.
- Somewhat.

1043
02:19:48,560 --> 02:19:51,700
- His hearing also is little affected.

1044
02:20:09,180 --> 02:20:15,260
- Better now? Are you hearing Me better?
 - Yes.
 - All right

[SHRI MATAJI CLEARING THE LITTLE BOY]

1046
02:20:27,580 --> 02:20:32,460
- Now, can you hear better?
 - Yes
 - Annh, really?

1047
02:20:32,740 --> 02:20:36,980
- You see, something. He couldn't hear properly
- [UNCLEAR]
 - Now just..

1048
02:20:37,200 --> 02:20:41,920
- Better now. How do you feel now?
 - Good
 - Calm

1049
02:20:42,140 --> 02:20:48,580
- Yes.
 - It's calm?
 - [PEOPLE TALKING TOGETHER]

1050
02:20:48,820 --> 02:20:54,980
He's all right now. All right? You may smile now. What happened, who boxed you here?

1051
02:20:55,280 --> 02:20:59,720
Somebody else, some boy? Who made the black eye?

1052
02:20:59,920 --> 02:21:05,820
- [UNCLEAR]
 -Annh?
 - [UNCLEAR]
 - Some friend? All right, doesn't matter.

1053
02:21:06,840 --> 02:21:13,400
- Is he a realized soul?
 - Yes
 - He's born realized. He's a born realized you must respect him.

1054
02:21:13,700 --> 02:21:16,860
He's a very sensible [UNCLEAR]

1055
02:21:17,140 --> 02:21:22,100
You shouldn't loose temper with him. You see, they don't like it because they are to be respected - they're realized souls.

1056
02:21:23,160 --> 02:21:28,960
[UNCLEAR] [SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS]

1057
02:21:29,180 --> 02:21:34,360
- You're all right.
 - Yes.
 - Fine? You must laugh.

1058
02:21:34,680 --> 02:21:41,340
- Thank You, Mother.
- May God bless you!

1059
02:21:42,380 --> 02:21:49,220
He's all right. Give him something, some ice here sometimes in the day time, in the day time about in the.

1060
02:21:49,480 --> 02:21:55,960
Not too much heat in the house also. All this catch is there. All this liver and all. Now he's all right.

1061
02:21:56,160 --> 02:22:01,120
- Are you all right?
 - Yes.
 - Now if he does anything to you, tell Me - all right?

1062
02:22:01,820 --> 02:22:09,720
- You tell Me on the photograph, all right?
 - Yes
 - God bless you! He's all right.

1063
02:22:12,800 --> 02:22:16,240
No, you're very strict. I think, people are very strict with their children in the West.

1064
02:22:16,540 --> 02:22:21,680
Should not be strict with your children - worried about the carpet, worried about these nonsensical things,

1065
02:22:22,020 --> 02:22:28,960
these plastics and this and that not about the children and then we talk to them so

1066
02:22:29,280 --> 02:22:34,860
uh.. so much, you see, disciplining them so much that ultimately they become hippies.

1067
02:22:35,600 --> 02:22:42,700
- All right, one question, when You are [UNCLEAR] is Your hand burning?

1068
02:22:43,300 --> 02:22:48,340
- [SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS]
- Actually, She never burns.
 - [UNCLEAR]

1069
02:22:48,580 --> 02:22:52,720
- I wonder whether You would be feeling a lot of heat.
- No, no, no, no

1070
02:22:52,940 --> 02:22:59,740
They were all quite hot, I must say, it was a little bit burning. Yes you all feel guilty for nothing at all

1071
02:22:59,940 --> 02:23:05,100
all the time. This is a fashion, "I'm guilty." For what? Are you going to jail or what.

1072
02:23:05,360 --> 02:23:11,180
Then why to say, "I'm guilty." Everybody says, "I'm guilty." That's why it burns, you know.

1073
02:23:11,400 --> 02:23:17,660
Then I'm was trying to take out this idea from your heads. You're not guilty at all. Your brother is all right.

1074
02:23:17,900 --> 02:23:21,500
Just imagine, what a disease! You're feeling all right?

1075
02:23:22,520 --> 02:23:25,160
- Yes.
 - Comfortable, good. Look at him!

1076
02:23:25,940 --> 02:23:32,940
He had  a nerve disease and legs and feet were all disappearing. All right, again let us see him tomorrow, hmm.

1077
02:23:36,380 --> 02:23:40,060
- We go now?
 - Yes, Mother.

1078
02:23:50,100 --> 02:23:58,420
- [UNCLEAR]
 - [INAUDIBLE] I'll try it.

1080
02:24:11,240 --> 02:24:17,940
- Where is she?
 - She's on her way. She's in Melbourne. [UNCLEAR]

1081
02:24:18,320 --> 02:24:21,460
