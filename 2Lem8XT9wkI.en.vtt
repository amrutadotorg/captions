00:00:03.291 --> 00:00:08.375
So now we are coming to the end

00:00:08.709 --> 00:00:13.375
of our first half tour.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.583
Now we have to look back upon ourselves

00:00:20.041 --> 00:00:25.500
and try to find out what have we achieved out of this.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.333
We must understand that Sahaja Yoga

00:00:28.542 --> 00:00:32.709
is not done through brain activities.

00:00:33.583 --> 00:00:39.542
Like many people think that if you just

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:44.291
tell yourself, "You have to be like this", it will work out.

00:00:44.542 --> 00:00:47.125
If you have to all the time inform yourself that,

00:00:47.291 --> 00:00:51.333
"Oh, you must get rid of a particular problem", you'll be all right.

00:00:51.542 --> 00:00:55.583
Or some people think that if they tell somebody,

00:00:55.709 --> 00:00:58.625
that "This is wrong with you and you should get well",

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.542
it will be all right. It is not so.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.583
Because Sahaja Yoga does not work on mental level.

00:01:07.041 --> 00:01:10.542
It works on spiritual level which is a much higher level

00:01:10.709 --> 00:01:12.291
than the mental level.

00:01:12.458 --> 00:01:14.542
So what you have to do

00:01:14.709 --> 00:01:18.583
is to understand how to correct your chakras.

00:01:19.041 --> 00:01:24.500
And you must understand how to work out your machines.

00:01:24.709 --> 00:01:27.166
Perhaps people still live

00:01:27.375 --> 00:01:32.000
on mental level and try to solve problems on mental level.

00:01:32.166 --> 00:01:35.583
And that's why all the problems start coming out.

00:01:36.041 --> 00:01:39.083
Now, if you have a problem with any chakras

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:40.625
or there is anything catching

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.625
or you find that there's something wrong with you,

00:01:44.083 --> 00:01:50.041
no use working it out on any other level but spiritual level.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Some people believe that if they have dressed up like something

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.333
or if they outwardly behave like something, they become that.

00:02:04.542 --> 00:02:06.125
That is not true.

00:02:06.333 --> 00:02:09.250
Like we have hippies in the West

00:02:09.458 --> 00:02:11.458
and they think that they have become primitive.

00:02:11.625 --> 00:02:15.625
You do not become primitive by believing it.

00:02:16.166 --> 00:02:20.458
Because you are so overdeveloped, that you cannot become primitive.

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:27.417
So by just doing something mentally we do not become.

00:02:30.291 --> 00:02:31.667
Now, this mental level

00:02:32.083 --> 00:02:35.625
can go even further in a subtler way into people.

00:02:36.083 --> 00:02:39.000
Some of you might feel that by

00:02:39.166 --> 00:02:45.166
knowing some of the aartis and things by heart

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.542
you will achieve great depth, it is not true, also.

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:50.709
Because that is also just words.

00:02:51.208 --> 00:02:54.709
But, if that is an awakened thing within you,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.583
then they become a mantra.

00:02:57.166 --> 00:02:59.208
And then you can work it out.

00:02:59.417 --> 00:03:05.041
But first of all you must achieve a certain standard

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.208
to have that power to create the mantras.

00:03:09.417 --> 00:03:14.208
Also, when you say some aarti, it's not necessarily

00:03:14.417 --> 00:03:17.125
possible that it will work out.

00:03:17.291 --> 00:03:19.709
Let us face the things as they are

00:03:20.166 --> 00:03:23.667
and not to be conditioned by anything else.

00:03:24.125 --> 00:03:29.500
You have to achieve a certain depth within yourself

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:35.667
to even enlighten the mantras.

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:39.458
First of all you should have clear-cut vibrations,

00:03:39.625 --> 00:03:41.500
minimum of minimum.

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:45.500
If you have certain chakras catching, then

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:50.333
try to improve your chakras with the photograph.

00:03:50.583 --> 00:03:53.709
With all due respect to the photograph. It's only the photograph

00:03:54.166 --> 00:03:57.333
which is going to work it out. Nothing else.

00:03:57.542 --> 00:03:59.250
Or if I am there.

00:03:59.458 --> 00:04:04.000
But once you have achieved a certain state of enlightenment,

00:04:04.208 --> 00:04:10.625
then you can use mantras otherwise also, it will help you.

00:04:11.417 --> 00:04:15.583
But first of all your heart must be clear.

00:04:16.083 --> 00:04:21.291
I've found out, in general, there are two chakras

00:04:21.625 --> 00:04:24.709
overwhelmingly

00:04:25.709 --> 00:04:30.333
not working all right in most of the western people.

00:04:30.667 --> 00:04:33.041
First is the heart.

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:36.000
That means heart is not clear,

00:04:36.166 --> 00:04:38.000
that heart is not clean,

00:04:38.166 --> 00:04:44.000
that in the heart you still are a small person,

00:04:44.208 --> 00:04:48.083
in the heart you have not placed your Mother.

00:04:49.208 --> 00:04:52.041
You have to purify your heart

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:58.250
by looking at the photograph and putting all loving feelings

00:04:59.125 --> 00:05:03.208
about your Mother, understanding Her work

00:05:03.417 --> 00:05:07.041
and putting Her into your heart.

00:05:07.583 --> 00:05:09.542
If the heart is not clear,

00:05:09.709 --> 00:05:13.083
then everything has no meaning because it is a "dark heart"

00:05:13.291 --> 00:05:16.291
which is doing all these things.

00:05:16.709 --> 00:05:21.083
The heart has to be clean, absolutely surrendered

00:05:21.291 --> 00:05:26.583
and must try to put Me before everything else.

00:05:27.083 --> 00:05:28.667
I can tell you because you are all Sahaja Yogis,

00:05:29.083 --> 00:05:32.709
I cannot say this to people who are not Sahaja Yogis.

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.709
Now, we always try to relate

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:43.291
Sahaja Yoga from our own terms,

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:47.458
not from the terms that belong to God.

00:05:47.709 --> 00:05:52.667
God is what He is, He cannot change Himself. You have to change.

00:05:53.166 --> 00:05:58.083
So whatever we think about God we want to put on that.

00:05:58.291 --> 00:06:04.333
For example, if someone

00:06:04.709 --> 00:06:09.417
thinks that he tries to be nice or good to Me,

00:06:09.625 --> 00:06:13.291
or if he is close to Me, so-called,

00:06:13.542 --> 00:06:17.208
and if he thinks he is organizing better

00:06:17.375 --> 00:06:20.250
or he's doing this work or that work

00:06:20.458 --> 00:06:23.125
or anything else like that, where he feels

00:06:23.291 --> 00:06:28.000
that he's important because he is doing this job or that job,

00:06:28.208 --> 00:06:31.250
then one must know

00:06:31.667 --> 00:06:35.291
that all this is mental.

00:06:35.709 --> 00:06:38.583
Actually, you are doing nothing.

00:06:39.041 --> 00:06:40.458
Whenever you try to do something,

00:06:40.583 --> 00:06:43.375
you really confuse yourself and confuse Me also.

00:06:43.625 --> 00:06:45.625
You have seen yesterday's example.

00:06:46.041 --> 00:06:49.125
I was sure that they had to go next day.

00:06:49.333 --> 00:06:52.709
But nobody would listen to Me, and they rushed away

00:06:53.166 --> 00:06:57.291
and they found that the tickets were for the next day.

00:06:58.083 --> 00:07:03.041
This knowledge comes to you if you are clear-hearted.

00:07:04.583 --> 00:07:06.375
As yesterday I said, "You better not come".

00:07:06.542 --> 00:07:08.333
I didn't know what was the situation there -

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:10.166
I just said, "Don't come" â€” finished.

00:07:10.291 --> 00:07:13.375
Because I knew what was going to happen there.

00:07:13.583 --> 00:07:17.208
So this clear-cut idea comes to you when your heart is clean.

00:07:17.417 --> 00:07:21.375
But first of all, people do not understand that you have to work it

00:07:21.583 --> 00:07:24.166
through your heart and not through your brain.

00:07:24.375 --> 00:07:26.709
When we have to work out things through our brain,

00:07:27.166 --> 00:07:29.709
we try to develop our brain, isn't it?

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:33.625
By memorizing, by practising something,

00:07:34.041 --> 00:07:37.667
teaching our brain how to think, how to go this way that way.

00:07:38.125 --> 00:07:39.709
We try to train our brain.

00:07:40.208 --> 00:07:44.041
Now, we have to train our heart in Sahaja Yoga.

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:47.583
And to train our heart in Sahaja Yoga

00:07:48.208 --> 00:07:50.125
one has to know, first of all,

00:07:50.291 --> 00:07:56.208
that it is enveloped either by ego or by superego.

00:07:56.417 --> 00:08:00.709
The limbic area actually represents the heart.

00:08:01.583 --> 00:08:07.583
And if there is ego, heart will always be so-called,

00:08:07.709 --> 00:08:10.333
it will not be the real heart that will be working,

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:13.375
but it's only mental, mental projection.

00:08:13.583 --> 00:08:16.083
And you will feel that I'm doing it from my heart.

00:08:16.291 --> 00:08:18.417
but it's not true.

00:08:18.709 --> 00:08:23.291
Now then, supposing, what should we do if we have ego?

00:08:23.583 --> 00:08:25.458
You might say you should try to

00:08:25.667 --> 00:08:29.000
sort of tell yourself that that's not good and

00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:32.667
this and that and all kinds of mental suggestions

00:08:33.125 --> 00:08:34.709
or autosuggestions or this -

00:08:35.166 --> 00:08:39.250
the way psychiatrists know that give you suggestions.

00:08:39.458 --> 00:08:42.041
That's again mental.

00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:45.709
So that's not the way it is going to work out.

00:08:46.208 --> 00:08:49.375
We must understand that for that what we have to do is to

00:08:49.542 --> 00:08:51.667
raise the left side and put it to the right side.

00:08:52.083 --> 00:08:53.583
There's no other way out.

00:08:53.709 --> 00:08:55.625
You have to just work it out with your hands,

00:08:56.041 --> 00:08:59.583
your hands are working it out and not your brain.

00:08:59.709 --> 00:09:04.166
So use your hands and the methods of Sahaja Yoga.

00:09:04.375 --> 00:09:09.542
Now, everyone must have

00:09:09.709 --> 00:09:14.333
a regular sitting in the water every day, that's important.

00:09:14.583 --> 00:09:18.041
Every morning you must do your meditation.

00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:23.583
Because on mental level we feel we have been with Mother, all right,

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.041
this exposure is all right.

00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:30.000
You came you saw how Indians are and how they are light

00:09:30.208 --> 00:09:36.542
on their feet and how they are good for Sahaja Yoga.

00:09:36.709 --> 00:09:40.417
But after seeing all that

00:09:40.625 --> 00:09:44.458
you have to know that Sahaja Yoga is to be worked out,

00:09:44.667 --> 00:09:47.542
it 's not to be thought out.

00:09:48.041 --> 00:09:50.041
You just cannot think about it.

00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:53.625
Whatever you may try to do through your thought,

00:09:54.083 --> 00:09:55.709
you cannot achieve any results in Sahaja Yoga.

00:09:56.125 --> 00:09:58.583
You have to use your hands, you have to use your feet,

00:09:59.041 --> 00:10:03.333
you have to soak your feet in the water because water is the ocean.

00:10:03.542 --> 00:10:06.458
All these five chakras -

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.041
or, say, six chakras

00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:15.709
which are â€” I say five because theâ€¦ one is the Mooladhara Chakra,

00:10:16.166 --> 00:10:22.000
which is the seventh, and the topmost is the brain.

00:10:22.542 --> 00:10:26.041
So in between five chakras which are there â€”

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:28.500
are to be handled fully

00:10:28.709 --> 00:10:35.208
with the idea that they are basically made of matter.

00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:42.083
And these five elements constitute

00:10:42.458 --> 00:10:46.083
the body of these chakras.

00:10:46.291 --> 00:10:48.583
Now, these chakras,

00:10:48.709 --> 00:10:53.542
if they are to be corrected, we have to correct them by taking out

00:10:53.709 --> 00:10:58.000
all the problems of these chakras into the elements

00:10:58.208 --> 00:11:01.208
from which they're coming.

00:11:01.542 --> 00:11:07.542
For example, a person who is a very right-sided person.

00:11:07.709 --> 00:11:12.041
So he has to give a balance by the left-side.

00:11:12.709 --> 00:11:14.709
Of course, raising with the hand is all right,

00:11:14.709 --> 00:11:17.333
but what about the element?

00:11:17.625 --> 00:11:22.542
Right-sided person has all the elements which give heat:

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.542
we can say, the light, we can say, the fire.

00:11:27.709 --> 00:11:31.083
So for people who are right-sided

00:11:31.291 --> 00:11:35.000
the light is not going to help much.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.709
Like if you put the light before the photograph,

00:11:39.166 --> 00:11:41.041
and those who are ego-oriented people â€”

00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:44.458
if you just use the light, it's not going to work out.

00:11:44.709 --> 00:11:48.417
So what is going to work out is the Mother Earth

00:11:48.625 --> 00:11:54.291
and the water element, which is cooling.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:01.000
Even ice is very helpful to people who are right-sided.

00:12:02.709 --> 00:12:08.583
So all cooling effects should be used for correcting

00:12:09.125 --> 00:12:13.625
your right-sidedness,

00:12:14.125 --> 00:12:16.000
so that you cool it down.

00:12:16.208 --> 00:12:18.375
Same about food.

00:12:18.583 --> 00:12:23.625
In food, those who are right-sided people should take to

00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:26.583
foods which are left-sided, that is carbohydrates â€”

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.709
means they should become partly vegetarians,

00:12:30.125 --> 00:12:33.083
or quite a lot vegetarian â€”

00:12:33.542 --> 00:12:38.333
and should eat things at the most like chicken,

00:12:38.542 --> 00:12:43.417
but not fishes, not seafoods because they are all hot.

00:12:43.709 --> 00:12:49.458
That's how you treat your material side of your chakras.

00:12:49.709 --> 00:12:53.709
Now, the left-sided people should use, again,

00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:57.250
the deepam â€” is the light â€” or the fire

00:12:57.458 --> 00:13:01.625
to correct their left side.

00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:03.709
Also in food

00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:08.583
such people should take more to nitrogenous, means protein

00:13:09.041 --> 00:13:13.709
and foods like that. They should take more proteins.

00:13:14.583 --> 00:13:20.083
Now, as far as Sahaja Yoga is concerned,

00:13:20.291 --> 00:13:23.333
the basic thing is Kundalini.

00:13:23.542 --> 00:13:29.500
And the Kundalini, as I have told you, is the pure desire.

00:13:29.709 --> 00:13:34.375
Again, listen to it carefully: pure desire.

00:13:34.583 --> 00:13:37.542
That means all other desires are impure.

00:13:38.041 --> 00:13:43.208
There's only one pure desire. And that is to be one with the Divine.

00:13:43.417 --> 00:13:49.291
One with the Brahma, one with God â€” that's the only pure desire.

00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:52.709
All other desires are impure.

00:13:53.208 --> 00:13:57.500
So train your mind gradually

00:13:58.083 --> 00:14:02.208
to achieve that desire as the main thing.

00:14:03.083 --> 00:14:06.500
If you train your mind in that fashion,

00:14:06.709 --> 00:14:09.667
then you can develop pure desire,

00:14:10.083 --> 00:14:15.375
so all other desires will negate, gradually.

00:14:15.709 --> 00:14:17.000
All right.

00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:23.166
Now, this desire to be one with the Divine

00:14:24.208 --> 00:14:27.542
is the purest and the highest.

00:14:27.709 --> 00:14:30.709
And to achieve that

00:14:31.291 --> 00:14:34.291
what have you to do?

00:14:35.667 --> 00:14:40.041
To achieve that you have to keep your Mother pleased.

00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:43.083
Very simple.

00:14:43.291 --> 00:14:46.417
Adi Shankaracharya has said that you don't bother about it,

00:14:46.583 --> 00:14:48.542
just keep your Mother pleased.

00:14:49.041 --> 00:14:51.041
You have to be a simple person,

00:14:51.250 --> 00:14:53.667
not try to be cunning with Me or clever with Me,

00:14:54.083 --> 00:14:56.333
I know everyone very well.

00:14:56.542 --> 00:15:00.542
Try to tell yourself that "I should say things,

00:15:00.709 --> 00:15:05.333
I should behave in a manner that will please my Mother."

00:15:05.542 --> 00:15:09.166
Supposing you are in Sahaja Yoga and you are doing wrong things.

00:15:09.375 --> 00:15:12.458
It is not going to please Me at all.

00:15:13.333 --> 00:15:17.542
So how to please Mother â€” that you should try to see for yourself,

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:23.041
what kind of a thing pleases Me the best.

00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:25.208
I am also a very simple person.

00:15:25.417 --> 00:15:29.542
So I want a simple-hearted person who is simple about it.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.166
For example, a person who tries to show off too much,

00:15:33.375 --> 00:15:35.542
try to be always the first

00:15:35.709 --> 00:15:40.500
or try to be always theâ€¦ sort of a

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.625
cinema star â€” I don't like such people.

00:15:45.125 --> 00:15:49.000
You have to be very quiet

00:15:49.166 --> 00:15:52.583
and extremely

00:15:54.375 --> 00:16:00.166
shy about showing off yourself.

00:16:00.709 --> 00:16:03.667
Do I show off that I am Adi Shakti?

00:16:04.125 --> 00:16:05.458
I do not.

00:16:05.667 --> 00:16:10.417
I live like you, absolutely like you, do I try to show off?

00:16:10.625 --> 00:16:13.542
Then why should you try to show off to Me?

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.041
So that kind of a person is no good.

00:16:18.250 --> 00:16:21.583
Secondly, you should not be tense with Me,

00:16:21.709 --> 00:16:23.583
there is no need to be tense.

00:16:24.041 --> 00:16:26.709
If I find something wrong with you,

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.542
if I scold you also â€” it's for your good.

00:16:28.709 --> 00:16:30.458
If I say a good word â€” it is for your good.

00:16:30.625 --> 00:16:33.208
My Sahaja Yoga works this way.

00:16:33.417 --> 00:16:36.041
I have no malice against

00:16:36.250 --> 00:16:39.125
anyone in the whole world, no malice at all,

00:16:39.333 --> 00:16:41.625
and no anger for anyone in this world.

00:16:41.709 --> 00:16:45.667
I have nothing but compassion, but in compassion sometimes

00:16:46.083 --> 00:16:50.000
I have to scold and in the same compassion I have to speak

00:16:50.208 --> 00:16:52.583
in a very compassionate manner.

00:16:53.125 --> 00:16:56.458
So both ways it helps you,

00:16:57.125 --> 00:16:59.000
it helps you both ways.

00:16:59.208 --> 00:17:01.542
So thank God

00:17:01.709 --> 00:17:05.625
that you have somebody who will correct you at the right time,

00:17:06.041 --> 00:17:09.166
for your good, because you are saints.

00:17:09.375 --> 00:17:14.458
And you have come on this Earth to establish God's Kingdom.

00:17:14.667 --> 00:17:16.125
That's what you have to do.

00:17:16.333 --> 00:17:18.291
And if you are the people

00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:22.250
who are not respected, who are not sensible,

00:17:22.458 --> 00:17:26.583
who haven't got the dignity, who behave in a cheapish way,

00:17:26.709 --> 00:17:29.709
how can people accept you.

00:17:31.333 --> 00:17:35.500
So this Heart Chakra is to be first looked after.

00:17:35.709 --> 00:17:37.542
That with your heart â€”

00:17:37.709 --> 00:17:40.709
desire that you'll keep your Mother pleased.

00:17:41.166 --> 00:17:44.083
Even if I'm angry with you, don't feel bad about it.

00:17:44.291 --> 00:17:47.041
That's one of the signs that Sahaja Yoga has not yet developed.

00:17:47.250 --> 00:17:49.375
If I scold you, it is because there's something in you

00:17:49.542 --> 00:17:52.041
which has to go away and which I must scold so it will go away.

00:17:52.333 --> 00:17:57.709
So accept it just as a correcting point that is good for you,

00:17:58.166 --> 00:18:00.542
some sort of a thorn is within you

00:18:00.709 --> 00:18:02.375
which has to be taken out by another thorn,

00:18:02.542 --> 00:18:05.291
and Mother has taken it out.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.709
Once you start understanding the compassion of your Mother,

00:18:09.125 --> 00:18:10.500
you will not mind.

00:18:11.041 --> 00:18:14.500
My saying anything to you, My correcting you

00:18:14.709 --> 00:18:18.500
or My telling you that this is wrong.

00:18:18.709 --> 00:18:21.500
Because I have to do that.

00:18:21.709 --> 00:18:26.125
Now, those people who do not have a good heart, clean heart,

00:18:26.333 --> 00:18:29.375
cannot understand this.

00:18:29.709 --> 00:18:32.166
They cannot understand this. Very difficult.

00:18:32.375 --> 00:18:35.417
So you keep your heart clean towards your Mother.

00:18:35.625 --> 00:18:40.417
Whatever I do for you is just a blessing, always a blessing for you.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:45.375
Whatever I do for you is a blessing, remember that.

00:18:45.583 --> 00:18:47.542
Now, another chakra which is

00:18:47.709 --> 00:18:51.333
horribly caught up with most of you is your Nabhi Chakra,

00:18:51.542 --> 00:18:56.417
suggesting that you are still very very materialistic.

00:18:57.709 --> 00:19:00.250
In small small things also we are materialistic,

00:19:00.458 --> 00:19:04.417
it becomes subtler and subtler and subtlerâ€¦

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:10.417
So try to understand that matter is not so important.

00:19:11.041 --> 00:19:15.041
Matter is just there to please each other.

00:19:15.250 --> 00:19:18.000
Specially to please your Mother.

00:19:18.166 --> 00:19:21.333
It has no other value whatsoever.

00:19:21.542 --> 00:19:25.709
So you should not try to be materialistic, in the sense that,

00:19:26.250 --> 00:19:28.709
you see, for a little thing you have to do this,

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.542
for a little thing you have to do that.

00:19:31.125 --> 00:19:34.125
Nothing is important. If it works out â€” well and good,

00:19:34.333 --> 00:19:36.583
and if it doesn't work out â€” well and good.

00:19:37.083 --> 00:19:40.542
So, you see, Nabhi Chakra is very individualistic,

00:19:40.709 --> 00:19:45.125
very individualistic. It is everybody's personal thing.

00:19:45.333 --> 00:19:48.583
If your desire is only up to Lakshmi power point

00:19:48.709 --> 00:19:51.125
that you want to have more money

00:19:51.291 --> 00:19:54.000
or you care for little things here and there,

00:19:54.166 --> 00:19:57.458
without any spiritual value to it,

00:19:57.667 --> 00:20:01.166
then your Lakshmi Tattwa at the most might be awakened.

00:20:01.375 --> 00:20:05.125
But this Lakshmi Tattwa has to become Mahalakshmi Tattwa.

00:20:05.333 --> 00:20:06.709
That is for your ascent.

00:20:07.166 --> 00:20:11.000
And just to get it to that Mahalakshmi Tattwa

00:20:11.166 --> 00:20:15.375
what you have to do is to use all your material things

00:20:15.625 --> 00:20:19.500
and your material being in such a way that you please Me.

00:20:19.709 --> 00:20:21.542
That is very important.

00:20:21.709 --> 00:20:25.208
So you should not do something that will not please Me.

00:20:25.417 --> 00:20:29.125
That's very important, everybody must understand.

00:20:29.333 --> 00:20:34.291
I want you to understand that when you dress up, also,

00:20:34.458 --> 00:20:39.625
certain things I don't like, at all, like disheveled hairâ€¦ At all.

00:20:40.125 --> 00:20:42.583
That might be of fashion, whatever, but I don't like it.

00:20:42.709 --> 00:20:46.417
Always must be properly combed, properly done hair.

00:20:46.625 --> 00:20:49.583
These modern things you should give up, of disheveled hair,

00:20:49.709 --> 00:20:52.542
because this is a sign of pukka bhoots coming into you.

00:20:52.709 --> 00:20:56.041
If you have disheveled hair, the bhoots recognize the person

00:20:56.250 --> 00:20:58.583
and they get into such a person who has disheveled hair.

00:20:58.709 --> 00:21:01.458
So try to make your hair in a proper way,

00:21:01.667 --> 00:21:05.000
see now Indians how they make their hair.

00:21:05.208 --> 00:21:08.083
Look at them: they all make their hair properly.

00:21:08.291 --> 00:21:11.000
Because â€” I have nothing to do with your hair,

00:21:11.166 --> 00:21:16.166
I'm not a hairstyling person or anything,

00:21:16.375 --> 00:21:21.250
but â€” if you do not have your hair properly combed and done,

00:21:21.458 --> 00:21:25.500
then definitely you are in for trouble.

00:21:26.041 --> 00:21:30.417
So take heed to these things.

00:21:30.625 --> 00:21:35.458
Then, some people have a habit of being untidily dressed,

00:21:35.667 --> 00:21:38.709
that's also not a good thing. You have to be tidily dressed,

00:21:38.709 --> 00:21:40.542
clean and tidily dressed.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.125
Not because it is material,

00:21:44.333 --> 00:21:47.542
but is very important that if it is not so,

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.375
that kind of a material will attract

00:21:50.542 --> 00:21:53.709
all the badhas into you.

00:21:56.083 --> 00:21:59.250
You must keep yourself clean and neat

00:21:59.458 --> 00:22:02.458
because these badhas should not enter.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.166
All these ideas that have come to the West

00:22:05.333 --> 00:22:08.166
have come from some satanic force.

00:22:08.375 --> 00:22:11.542
It doesn't look beautiful, in any way it doesn't look good

00:22:11.709 --> 00:22:15.000
for any spiritual person.

00:22:15.709 --> 00:22:17.709
We have to change our styles

00:22:18.166 --> 00:22:21.500
that will be appealing to the Divine and not to the bhoots.

00:22:21.709 --> 00:22:24.625
We don't want any bhoots to come on us.

00:22:25.125 --> 00:22:27.250
If you understand this simple fact,

00:22:27.417 --> 00:22:29.709
then you will start dressing up in a way

00:22:30.166 --> 00:22:34.542
that may not be modern, may not be ancient, whatever it is â€”

00:22:34.709 --> 00:22:39.208
is neat, clean, spick-and-span.

00:22:42.417 --> 00:22:47.500
Otherwise, also, if you see to the matter point more and more,

00:22:47.709 --> 00:22:50.583
no use accumulating thousand and one things

00:22:50.709 --> 00:22:55.333
which are plastic in temperament and nature.

00:22:55.709 --> 00:23:01.333
You should have few things which have a spiritual value.

00:23:02.458 --> 00:23:05.709
Not all extraordinary things that we try to have â€”

00:23:06.208 --> 00:23:08.583
because they have no spiritual value.

00:23:09.083 --> 00:23:13.542
So try not to accumulate all these nonsensical things to you.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.458
Gradually you will find you'll reduce, you go on reducing.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.291
You'll have simpler lives,

00:23:20.542 --> 00:23:24.333
better things and spiritual things.

00:23:24.583 --> 00:23:27.417
Whatever you buy, see the vibrations and then buy,

00:23:27.625 --> 00:23:29.041
otherwise just don't buy.

00:23:29.250 --> 00:23:33.166
Because all kinds of nonsensical bhoots will be in your house

00:23:33.375 --> 00:23:34.542
and you will be troubled.

00:23:34.709 --> 00:23:38.583
So whatever you want to buy you must see on vibratory awareness.

00:23:39.083 --> 00:23:42.041
If you cannot understand, ask somebody else, a Sahaja Yogi

00:23:42.208 --> 00:23:43.208
to help you out.

00:23:43.417 --> 00:23:47.500
But don't go on buying things just because you think they are cheap,

00:23:47.709 --> 00:23:50.542
or they are nice, or good.

00:23:51.041 --> 00:23:56.542
So try to buy things which, vibration-wise, are all right.

00:23:57.083 --> 00:24:00.667
And if it is not so â€” finished, it's nothing important.

00:24:01.083 --> 00:24:04.208
That "I must buy this, I have to go to Bombay to buy this" â€”

00:24:04.417 --> 00:24:07.417
that's a wrong idea.

00:24:08.417 --> 00:24:13.250
Now, attention has to be inward all the time.

00:24:13.458 --> 00:24:17.417
I've seen that our attention is outward.

00:24:17.625 --> 00:24:24.000
Because of that, what we see outside is not good for vibrations.

00:24:24.625 --> 00:24:26.625
But if your attention is inside,

00:24:27.041 --> 00:24:31.417
you will not buy anything that is not good for vibrations.

00:24:31.625 --> 00:24:35.333
Or you will not own some things, you'll just throw away.

00:24:35.542 --> 00:24:37.542
But the attention is outside

00:24:37.709 --> 00:24:42.125
and because of that you just don't know how to judge it.

00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:44.417
Nabhi Chakra has to be attended to.

00:24:44.667 --> 00:24:49.208
For that you don't have to think, you have to work it out,

00:24:49.417 --> 00:24:51.333
see which side of Nabhi is catching.

00:24:51.583 --> 00:24:55.417
If the right side is catching, for you sugar is the best.

00:24:55.667 --> 00:24:57.583
Sugar represents many things.

00:24:58.041 --> 00:25:01.542
Sugar means your, also, tongue should be sweet,

00:25:01.709 --> 00:25:03.583
you should talk sweetly.

00:25:03.709 --> 00:25:06.542
People think that if you talk sweetly to someone,

00:25:06.709 --> 00:25:09.709
then people will start thinking that you are good for nothing

00:25:10.166 --> 00:25:12.542
or you are absolutely a meek person.

00:25:12.709 --> 00:25:15.333
We have to be meek.

00:25:15.542 --> 00:25:17.500
We have to be meek and humble,

00:25:17.667 --> 00:25:21.250
we must learn how to talk sweetly to each other.

00:25:21.542 --> 00:25:25.041
And if you do not understand how to speak,

00:25:25.250 --> 00:25:28.291
then take more sugar, vibrated sugar.

00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:31.542
That will make your tongue sweeter and sweeter,

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.542
and your ideas will be sweeter about another person

00:25:34.709 --> 00:25:37.250
than harsh and criticizing.

00:25:37.458 --> 00:25:40.583
So for the right-sided people sugar is suggested.

00:25:40.709 --> 00:25:43.500
For the left-sided people â€” salt.

00:25:43.709 --> 00:25:47.500
Left-sided people should take salt more,

00:25:47.709 --> 00:25:50.542
and with salt they can solve many problems

00:25:51.083 --> 00:25:56.000
because salt gives them a personality, a composer

00:25:56.208 --> 00:25:59.709
by which they can express themselves

00:26:00.166 --> 00:26:05.583
in a way which is dignified and so not very lethargic.

00:26:06.417 --> 00:26:10.250
So the speed of your talks

00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:14.041
or behavior or everything should be in the center.

00:26:14.250 --> 00:26:16.000
It should not be lethargic,

00:26:16.208 --> 00:26:20.083
nor should be too quick and fast and hectic.

00:26:20.333 --> 00:26:21.458
So you will understand

00:26:21.625 --> 00:26:24.250
Sahaja Yoga is the central point of everything.

00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:27.500
Everything in the center one should try to bring it.

00:26:28.083 --> 00:26:30.291
Not one extreme to another extreme.

00:26:30.458 --> 00:26:33.542
If you talk too much and jabber too much and if you are fast,

00:26:33.709 --> 00:26:36.417
try to reduce your speed

00:26:36.667 --> 00:26:40.333
by alertly

00:26:41.125 --> 00:26:43.583
looking at it. You have to be alert.

00:26:43.709 --> 00:26:46.709
See, "My speed is going up; there's no need for me to talk.

00:26:47.208 --> 00:26:49.333
Let me stop."

00:26:49.542 --> 00:26:52.583
But those who do not talk at all also not good.

00:26:52.709 --> 00:26:56.333
So those who talk or those who do not talk

00:26:56.583 --> 00:26:58.458
have to understand only one thing â€”

00:26:58.625 --> 00:27:03.333
that whatever we talk, we talk in the center.

00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:09.625
Once you understand that, your responses to things

00:27:10.041 --> 00:27:14.250
will be absolutely central, balanced and beautiful.

00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:18.291
Now, this is all for Me, I can say at this time because

00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:20.333
the time is short also for us â€”

00:27:20.625 --> 00:27:23.166
we have all enjoyed our stay all over,

00:27:23.333 --> 00:27:26.375
I think, so you all have been happy all over

00:27:26.583 --> 00:27:29.458
and we have worked it out very well.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.458
And it has been quite a lesson to all of us

00:27:33.625 --> 00:27:37.041
and also a very great experience of enjoyment.

00:27:37.250 --> 00:27:39.333
So â€” not to feel guilty about anything

00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:43.250
because feeling guilty you do not get over it.

00:27:43.458 --> 00:27:46.166
Feeling guilty is an escape, you must face it.

00:27:46.375 --> 00:27:51.041
You must face it and see, correct yourself â€” and be one with it.

00:27:51.250 --> 00:27:53.542
That is a much better way than to just

00:27:53.709 --> 00:27:56.583
to go on feeling guilty or aggressive.

00:27:56.709 --> 00:27:59.542
That's not the way â€” because I said it's not mental.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.458
So if you understand these few points

00:28:02.667 --> 00:28:05.667
on these two chakras â€” is Nabhi

00:28:06.166 --> 00:28:08.208
and your Heart â€”

00:28:08.417 --> 00:28:10.709
if you understand these two points clearly

00:28:11.166 --> 00:28:14.125
that you must keep it clear,

00:28:14.583 --> 00:28:17.625
and the expression of that will show

00:28:18.083 --> 00:28:19.709
in your behavior, in your dress,

00:28:20.166 --> 00:28:22.542
in your walk, gait, talking and everything outside

00:28:22.709 --> 00:28:24.583
but you cannot go from outside, inside.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:26.583
Supposing somebody says that all right,

00:28:26.709 --> 00:28:31.250
"Mother, I've combed my hair very well, so I'm all right."

00:28:31.458 --> 00:28:34.166
It's not so.

00:28:34.375 --> 00:28:35.458
Not necessarily.

00:28:35.667 --> 00:28:38.583
Even if you have combed your hair, you might be possessed by bhoot.

00:28:39.083 --> 00:28:42.500
But at least less chances.

00:28:43.083 --> 00:28:48.000
So one has to understand it, that it has to be worked out.

00:28:48.208 --> 00:28:51.000
I think, this must be really screwed into your head

00:28:51.208 --> 00:28:53.333
that Sahaja Yoga is to be worked out.

00:28:53.542 --> 00:28:56.500
You cannot just tell yourself, "Oh, I'm very happy",

00:28:56.709 --> 00:28:58.125
because it pampers your ego,

00:28:58.333 --> 00:29:02.625
or "very unhappy", because it is troubling through your superego.

00:29:03.083 --> 00:29:06.500
"I'm not very happy", "I'm not veryâ€¦"

00:29:06.667 --> 00:29:09.125
"I'm very happy" or "I'm very unhappy".

00:29:09.333 --> 00:29:12.417
That's not the way. You have to be in joy.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.041
And these things can work out.

00:29:16.250 --> 00:29:19.000
You should have patience with yourself, love for yourself

00:29:19.166 --> 00:29:21.417
and dignity,

00:29:21.583 --> 00:29:23.000
that you are Sahaja Yogis.

00:29:23.166 --> 00:29:26.208
Every individual has to work it out for himself,

00:29:26.375 --> 00:29:27.667
so the whole can be all right.

00:29:28.083 --> 00:29:31.709
There could be some people who are only worried about others.

00:29:32.208 --> 00:29:35.583
Worry about yourself â€” and see the good points of others,

00:29:36.083 --> 00:29:39.166
not the bad points but good points of others.

00:29:39.375 --> 00:29:44.000
And, also, if somebody has to tell you that you must organize,

00:29:44.166 --> 00:29:47.333
go fast and all that â€” not to feel bad, we have to be like that.

00:29:47.542 --> 00:29:50.542
We have to be very quick, we have to do so much work in this world,

00:29:50.709 --> 00:29:53.542
we have no time to waste. We have no time to waste.

00:29:53.709 --> 00:29:55.417
It has to be very quick

00:29:55.625 --> 00:30:00.125
and we have to be very prompt and healthy about it.

00:30:00.583 --> 00:30:03.166
As you know that â€” in this trip you have seen that â€”

00:30:03.333 --> 00:30:05.709
how much work I've been doing compared to you people.

00:30:06.166 --> 00:30:10.000
And I am so much older compared to you people.

00:30:10.208 --> 00:30:12.583
All right, you can say that "Mother, You are Adi Shakti",

00:30:12.709 --> 00:30:14.166
it's all right, but I'm your ideal.

00:30:14.333 --> 00:30:16.458
In any case, if somebody's your ideal,

00:30:16.667 --> 00:30:18.250
try to become like that person,

00:30:18.458 --> 00:30:21.000
try to imbibe those qualities in you.

00:30:21.166 --> 00:30:22.166
So,

00:30:22.375 --> 00:30:26.500
now I may have to bid farewell to most of you who are going away.

00:30:26.709 --> 00:30:28.375
I hope I'll be able to see you

00:30:28.542 --> 00:30:31.250
but, as you know, I have programs and programs and programs.

00:30:31.458 --> 00:30:35.125
I don't know where I'm going to stay and where I will be â€”

00:30:35.333 --> 00:30:37.667
in any case, I'll try to be there.

00:30:38.083 --> 00:30:39.667
So the program is today,

00:30:40.083 --> 00:30:43.542
I have a program which I have to go for, you don't have to go.

00:30:43.709 --> 00:30:46.375
Now you are going to Kalwa where you'll have your

00:30:46.583 --> 00:30:48.542
lunch, I will be there.

00:30:48.709 --> 00:30:54.000
In a village, in a village way they are cooking something for you.

00:30:54.333 --> 00:30:58.083
And then I will be

00:30:58.291 --> 00:31:02.083
busy with some other programs Myself, so I go direct to Bombay.

00:31:02.291 --> 00:31:05.583
Then tomorrow morning

00:31:06.041 --> 00:31:10.083
I have a program, you don't have a program.

00:31:10.291 --> 00:31:12.625
So â€” I don't know, some of you might have to come,

00:31:13.083 --> 00:31:15.291
I don't know what the situation is â€” in any case,

00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:16.667
if you have to go out shopping,

00:31:17.083 --> 00:31:19.208
you can go and do some shopping in Bombay

00:31:19.417 --> 00:31:22.333
and get things for yourself if you want to do it,

00:31:22.542 --> 00:31:24.083
those who are going back.

00:31:24.291 --> 00:31:27.625
And evening time there's a wedding ofâ€¦

00:31:30.542 --> 00:31:35.417
Kamakshi and Malcolm.

00:31:35.709 --> 00:31:40.542
And whatever you want to give collectively, a present to them,

00:31:40.709 --> 00:31:43.500
whatever you have to do, you can do it tomorrow morning.

00:31:43.709 --> 00:31:47.125
And then day after tomorrow morningâ€¦

00:31:52.208 --> 00:31:55.583
23rd morning youâ€¦ most of you have to go to Delhi.

00:31:55.709 --> 00:31:57.625
But there are some who are not going to Delhi.

00:31:58.041 --> 00:32:02.166
Now raise your hands who are not going to Delhi on the 23rd.

00:32:11.417 --> 00:32:13.375
Warren?

00:32:13.542 --> 00:32:16.250
Warren? Warren isn't going?

00:32:16.458 --> 00:32:20.375
Warren, what is it, you are not going?

00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:27.583
All right. Soâ€¦

00:32:27.709 --> 00:32:29.709
YOGI: The rest of the group, fifty three people are going.

00:32:30.125 --> 00:32:31.709
All right. So you all are going.

00:32:32.208 --> 00:32:34.458
Those who are not going,

00:32:34.667 --> 00:32:38.208
out of them whoâ€¦ those who are going to Delhi,

00:32:38.375 --> 00:32:42.250
not 23rd but later on, raise your hands.

00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:48.375
London and Europe people.

00:32:48.583 --> 00:32:52.000
So this is the second group.

00:32:52.208 --> 00:32:54.583
Now those who are going to Delhi afterwards

00:32:55.041 --> 00:32:57.333
please see that you book your seats.

00:32:57.542 --> 00:32:59.375
You shouldn't give Me headache about this, you see,

00:32:59.542 --> 00:33:01.542
so you book your seats properly.

00:33:01.709 --> 00:33:04.125
All of you may not get your reservations,

00:33:04.333 --> 00:33:05.709
some of you are going by train.

00:33:06.208 --> 00:33:10.583
And inform the people in Delhi, yourself, organize it. You see?

00:33:11.125 --> 00:33:12.583
You can have Perekar

00:33:12.709 --> 00:33:16.583
and also somebody else, Jayvant â€” to help you out.

00:33:16.709 --> 00:33:18.417
That those who are going â€”

00:33:18.583 --> 00:33:21.542
these two persons, Perekar and Jayvant will look after you,

00:33:22.041 --> 00:33:24.041
you book your seatsâ€¦

00:33:28.709 --> 00:33:31.000
So you book your seats.

00:33:31.208 --> 00:33:35.500
Then also somebody must talk to Delhi people and find out,

00:33:35.709 --> 00:33:40.542
because they want to have you there for about seven days, with them.

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.500
Now, 26 January you all should be there,

00:33:43.667 --> 00:33:45.458
I hope you are all going to be there.

00:33:45.625 --> 00:33:48.417
26th morning they want to take you around to see the parade,

00:33:48.583 --> 00:33:51.709
I may not be there, 26th evening I may be there, I don't know.

00:33:52.208 --> 00:33:54.291
27th they are starting the program.

00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:58.667
So till the 26th whatever you have to do you can finish,

00:33:59.166 --> 00:34:01.250
and 27th I am starting my program,

00:34:01.417 --> 00:34:03.542
but still you will be staying with them, I think.

00:34:03.709 --> 00:34:08.583
They have got these flats from the 28th.

00:34:08.709 --> 00:34:12.041
So they have a wrong conception about you, they think you all want

00:34:12.250 --> 00:34:14.625
bathrooms and things attached, so they got the flats.

00:34:15.083 --> 00:34:17.333
And I told them that "Don't get the flats â€”

00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:20.625
is firstly they are rather expensive and

00:34:21.083 --> 00:34:26.625
also they don't want it, they want to go in a bungalow."

00:34:27.083 --> 00:34:29.625
But I don't know, they also have got conceptions,

00:34:30.083 --> 00:34:33.542
they think you are too attached to bathrooms, soâ€¦

00:34:33.709 --> 00:34:36.709
Which is true also.

00:34:38.417 --> 00:34:41.542
So they think they are obliging us by giving us

00:34:41.709 --> 00:34:44.125
bathroom attached rooms, you see.

00:34:44.333 --> 00:34:45.333
So that is why

00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:47.709
it has happened, now, whatever has happened has happened.

00:34:48.083 --> 00:34:50.542
Now, for the marriages.

00:34:50.709 --> 00:34:54.000
We have decided on marriages on these days.

00:34:54.208 --> 00:34:56.583
Now who has got the list?

00:35:04.709 --> 00:35:07.709
Who has got the list?

00:35:19.709 --> 00:35:23.291
YOGI: England mistakenly made [NAME] to [NAME]

00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:26.000
she should not be there, she's from Switzerland.

00:35:26.166 --> 00:35:27.709
Apart from that, that is the full list.

00:35:28.166 --> 00:35:30.166
Her marriage is already sorted.

00:35:30.375 --> 00:35:34.083
So, I don't know, but it's about eighty percent fixed.

00:35:34.291 --> 00:35:36.291
Soâ€¦

00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:39.500
Now, this you have given me, but now what I am trying to say,

00:35:39.709 --> 00:35:43.375
that who has chosen whom, that's not yet known.

00:35:43.583 --> 00:35:47.291
So pass on this list and by the time we are in Delhi you tell me.

00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:50.500
The marriages are going to be on the 6th.

00:35:50.709 --> 00:35:54.208
So there's still time for us to sort it out. On the 6th.

00:35:54.417 --> 00:35:56.083
YOGI: I think most of them are relying upon You

00:35:56.291 --> 00:35:57.208
to make certain suggestions.

00:35:57.417 --> 00:36:02.458
No no, I won't. I'm sorry, sir. Not me, sir.

00:36:03.125 --> 00:36:07.083
You know the joke? There was a fellow sitting on the fence

00:36:07.291 --> 00:36:11.000
and another gentleman went and going in a car he asked him,

00:36:11.166 --> 00:36:13.458
"How do you go to such a place?"

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.542
So he just looked at him, he said, "Not me, sorry,

00:36:16.709 --> 00:36:18.417
I'm not going to tell you."

00:36:18.667 --> 00:36:19.667
He said, "Why?"

00:36:20.083 --> 00:36:24.250
He said, "The one I told before has punched my nose.

00:36:24.542 --> 00:36:26.291
Not me, sorry."

00:36:26.500 --> 00:36:31.375
Will you please decide for yourself because decision making

00:36:31.583 --> 00:36:34.709
is so much there in the ego.

00:36:35.333 --> 00:36:36.709
So you do it in a proper way.

00:36:37.208 --> 00:36:39.709
Make your own decisions, you'll stick onto it better.

00:36:40.208 --> 00:36:44.000
Still that exists. Exists, what can we do about it.

00:36:44.166 --> 00:36:45.250
It exists, still.

00:36:45.458 --> 00:36:48.500
So betterâ€¦ this is the list, you go through it,

00:36:48.709 --> 00:36:53.166
make your selections and choices and don't force on anyone.

00:36:53.375 --> 00:36:56.375
Because again the same question, "No, sorry".

00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:03.375
It's absurd the way we do things, absurd, absolutely absurd.

00:37:03.583 --> 00:37:06.375
Marriage is not so important that way.

00:37:06.583 --> 00:37:09.208
Not so important. But this ego comes back

00:37:09.417 --> 00:37:12.083
and, "I have decided and now I have not",

00:37:12.291 --> 00:37:16.375
and then this and â€” all nonsense it is.

00:37:19.291 --> 00:37:23.458
So with that idea that once you are married you are married forever.

00:37:23.709 --> 00:37:25.333
Take a decision properly.

00:37:25.542 --> 00:37:27.041
So I bless all of you -

00:37:27.250 --> 00:37:29.709
all the brides and the bridegrooms. But I think there are more

00:37:30.250 --> 00:37:32.375
bridegrooms than the brides.

00:37:32.542 --> 00:37:34.166
YOGI: Yes, that's true, Mother.

00:37:34.375 --> 00:37:36.375
So I'll have to find out some brides.

00:37:36.583 --> 00:37:39.375
YOGI: A couple of them - two of them particularly have asked

00:37:39.583 --> 00:37:41.000
if they can marry Indian ladies at some point

00:37:41.208 --> 00:37:43.125
Not necessarily this time, Mother.

00:37:43.333 --> 00:37:45.542
There's one from Australiaâ€¦ two from Australia.

00:37:46.041 --> 00:37:46.709
Good idea.

00:37:47.166 --> 00:37:48.333
YOGI: They'd like to marry Maharashtrian girls.

00:37:48.542 --> 00:37:50.500
The one that was .. you were

00:37:50.709 --> 00:37:53.375
telling about, he's about 39 or something.

00:37:53.583 --> 00:37:55.291
YOGI: Yes, he'sâ€¦ he's one of them. Andâ€¦

00:37:55.500 --> 00:38:00.709
For him I found a girl but she's not yet been divorced, you see.

00:38:04.709 --> 00:38:07.709
She's not yet been divorced.

00:38:14.583 --> 00:38:16.250
So, any other questions you have,

00:38:16.458 --> 00:38:18.625
please ask Me before we start the puja.

00:38:19.083 --> 00:38:21.250
Good idea.

00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:23.500
Any other question?

00:38:23.709 --> 00:38:25.458
If you have really some question, ask,

00:38:25.667 --> 00:38:30.709
otherwise we have to finish the puja fast and we have to go away.

00:38:36.375 --> 00:38:38.583
YOGINI: Perhaps some of us don't know who the men are

00:38:38.709 --> 00:38:41.458
who are taking care of our tickets for Delhi

00:38:41.667 --> 00:38:44.500
I'm not familiar with them, I don't know the people,

00:38:44.709 --> 00:38:47.667
is there someone I can ask to be introduced to, so we know

00:38:48.125 --> 00:38:52.709
to see about our tickets for Delhi, I don't know their names.

00:38:53.542 --> 00:38:58.041
I have to go to America to really understand what did you say.

00:38:58.250 --> 00:38:59.166
What did she say?

00:38:59.375 --> 00:39:02.333
YOGI: About the tickets Shri Mataji - tell her to see Warren.

00:39:02.542 --> 00:39:06.166
Warren, you should see Warren. All right.

00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:10.291
Brian. Brian and Warren. All right.

00:39:10.542 --> 00:39:14.417
Now I have forgotten again American English. I'm sorry.

00:39:14.583 --> 00:39:18.542
In America I understand and I forget it, you see.

00:39:21.333 --> 00:39:24.709
English has so many versions.

00:39:27.041 --> 00:39:30.709
Australian English is differentâ€¦ Every English is different,

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:34.291
So sorry I've forgotten the American English.

00:39:34.709 --> 00:39:37.709
I'll get to it very soon.

00:39:38.417 --> 00:39:41.500
All right, done.
