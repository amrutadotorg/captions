WEBVTT

00:03.352 --> 00:10.416
I don’t know what to tell you more about
Shri Ganesh, because really it is so important

00:10.416 --> 00:19.331
that we have to know the importance of Mooladhara
Chakra.

00:19.378 --> 00:36.188
If you read the newspaper, just on the first
page you find people going amok as far as

00:36.213 --> 00:41.516
their moral sense is concerned, absolutely
I mean, to us it is something so shocking,

00:41.516 --> 00:50.818
and perhaps I think people are possessed on
their Mooladhara Chakra.

00:50.843 --> 00:58.735
The way they behave one feels that there’s
something gone wrong with them completely

00:58.774 --> 01:07.259
and they have no control over themselves;
and just like mad people they are behaving.

01:07.299 --> 01:13.539
And all these problems that are coming, of
these perversions, are due to this kind of

01:13.539 --> 01:17.729
a possession on the Mooladhara Chakra.

01:17.729 --> 01:23.969
One has to be very, very careful and respectful
about it.

01:23.969 --> 01:29.559
I have already told so many things how to
keep it clean, how to respect it and how to

01:29.559 --> 01:34.969
behave yourself.

01:34.969 --> 01:46.969
As you know, Shri Ganesha was created
at the gate of hell to protect us from falling

01:46.969 --> 01:49.349
into hell.

01:49.349 --> 02:01.079
But actually when we insult Him and we do
not care for Him, He just sleeps off.

02:01.079 --> 02:12.249
When that happens, any kind of a possession
can come and can really make people mad.

02:12.249 --> 02:21.589
When you come from India to these places you
are really surprised and shocked.

02:21.589 --> 02:27.589
What is wrong with these people, how can they
be behaving in this manner?

02:27.589 --> 02:33.788
How can they go all out to ruin themselves
like this?

02:33.788 --> 02:41.259
And how is it they do not understand the importance
of morality when they are following Christ?

02:41.259 --> 02:48.229
The Christians, I think, are the worst as
far as morality is concerned.

02:48.229 --> 02:50.659
They have no moral values left in them.

02:50.659 --> 02:58.788
It’s such a sad thing that the number of
people killed by Christians is also the maximum.

02:58.788 --> 03:06.159
Sometimes I think these people who were killed
everywhere might have possessed the Christians

03:06.159 --> 03:13.428
this way, that they are just going amok and
behaving in this manner, destroying themselves.

03:13.428 --> 03:22.759
Now the first quality of Shri Ganesha is that
He gives us wisdom.

03:22.759 --> 03:29.928
And that wisdom gives us the sense how to
behave, gives us the balance, and gives us

03:29.928 --> 03:41.009
the sense how to behave towards ourselves,
how to preserve yourself, how to respect yourself.

03:41.009 --> 03:52.879
But if Ganesha is not at all there to watch
you, might be from hell some horrible hellish

03:52.879 --> 03:57.519
bhoots are coming out, or I don’t know,
I cannot explain this kind of a thing.

03:57.519 --> 04:04.099
But the other way round, I’ll tell you,
in India, is specially with women, they are

04:04.099 --> 04:11.598
extremely particular about their chastity,
extremely particular.

04:11.598 --> 04:19.499
Like we had a queen called Padmini, and she
was a very beautiful woman.

04:19.499 --> 04:25.879
And one Muslim aggressor who became sultan
heard about her beauty.

04:25.879 --> 04:30.059
So he wanted to see her.

04:30.059 --> 04:33.739
So she refused, “I don’t want to see him.”

04:33.739 --> 04:43.778
Even seeing a woman like that: those bad eyes,
are bad; seeing a woman also, are bad.

04:43.778 --> 04:50.119
So he said, “If you do not allow me to see
her, I’ll invade your country.”

04:50.119 --> 04:56.198
So she agreed that, “All right, he can see
me in a mirror, so at least his bad eyes don’t

04:56.198 --> 04:57.769
fall on me directly.”

04:57.769 --> 04:58.869
She agreed to that.

04:58.869 --> 05:07.668
And he saw her in a mirror, and he saw that
it was even more beautiful than he had thought

05:07.668 --> 05:08.829
her to be.

05:08.829 --> 05:11.068
So now he wanted to have her.

05:11.068 --> 05:15.129
So physical, so superficial.

05:15.129 --> 05:21.608
And he said, “If you now do not come to
me, I will again attack.”

05:21.608 --> 05:28.249
So they made a plan, “Let us now decide
whether we are going to surrender our queen

05:28.249 --> 05:29.249
or not.”

05:29.249 --> 05:30.249
So everybody said, “Nothing doing.

05:30.249 --> 05:31.959
We are not going to surrender.”

05:31.959 --> 05:42.119
Because the chastity of a woman is very important,
and that of a queen, and a queen, who is representative

05:42.119 --> 05:47.038
of all the womanhood should not be sacrificed
like this.

05:47.038 --> 05:49.948
They could not bear the idea.

05:49.948 --> 05:57.098
So they said that, “All right, we’ll organize
something and cheat these people.”

05:57.098 --> 06:01.628
So they sent a word, “All right, we are
all coming and the queen is coming too.”

06:01.628 --> 06:03.348
And they sent hundred palanquins.

06:03.348 --> 06:07.929
We use palanquins for ladies in India, covered.

06:07.929 --> 06:14.038
And inside every palanquin there was one warrior
sitting with all the weapons.

06:14.038 --> 06:19.299
And there were four carrying the palanquin,
and all these four were also warriors.

06:19.299 --> 06:23.598
So thus they have about five hundred warriors.

06:23.598 --> 06:27.649
It was a small kingdom.

06:27.649 --> 06:31.989
So when they went down, these people were
very happy.

06:31.989 --> 06:32.989
“The queen is coming.”

06:32.989 --> 06:37.489
and they were all getting drunk and celebrating
it.

06:37.489 --> 06:38.878
“The queen is coming.

06:38.878 --> 06:39.878
Queen is coming.”

06:39.878 --> 06:41.498
So they were half drunk also.

06:41.498 --> 06:47.808
They had told these women that, “In case
we win, then we lit a fire and you will know

06:47.808 --> 06:49.909
that we have won.

06:49.909 --> 06:57.108
But if you do not see any thing like that,
then be sure that we have lost the war.”

06:57.108 --> 07:02.549
So the king sat in the front palanquin, and
the rest of them, and they went and attacked

07:02.549 --> 07:07.618
them in the sense that they first entered
inside, and then instead of the queen, the

07:07.618 --> 07:11.218
king came out and they all fought those people.

07:11.218 --> 07:16.299
But they were only five hundred so they could
not be saved, and these people had better

07:16.299 --> 07:19.239
weapons, so they were killed.

07:19.239 --> 07:21.769
They did not lit the fire.

07:21.769 --> 07:24.028
Now the women knew that all of them will be
coming.

07:24.028 --> 07:29.618
Now they were very rich sultans, very rich
Muslims, and things like that.

07:29.618 --> 07:36.358
But they thought that now their chastity is
in danger, so there was a big platform and

07:36.358 --> 07:37.968
they made a big pyre on that.

07:37.968 --> 07:48.598
And they all entered into it and killed themselves,
before they could enter and touch their body.

07:48.598 --> 07:56.068
So for women specially it is very important
to have a great sense of chastity.

07:56.068 --> 08:02.198
And if they do not have the great sense of
chastity, then they develop all kinds of funny

08:02.198 --> 08:07.408
ideas and mentally they become very imbalanced.

08:07.408 --> 08:13.549
And the children that they have, also become
very funny and you have all these problems

08:13.549 --> 08:17.258
of perverted relations, incest relations.

08:17.258 --> 08:24.019
And today I read a horrible story about a
little girl who suffered with this incest

08:24.019 --> 08:26.479
relationship.

08:26.479 --> 08:33.589
It’s hell that we have created.

08:33.589 --> 08:36.616
In hell what else is going to be?

08:38.587 --> 08:40.795
Same thing.

08:40.866 --> 08:45.569
There’s no sanity about it, there’s no
wisdom about it.

08:45.569 --> 08:54.649
So we have to now understand how we have to
build ourselves as Sahaja yogis.

08:54.649 --> 09:01.308
Men and women, all of them, have to go hand
in hand, because the first quality I told

09:01.308 --> 09:07.302
is wisdom, but the essence of Mooladhara is
innocence.

09:07.326 --> 09:10.565
They are made of innocence.

09:10.799 --> 09:13.889
The power of Ganesha is innocence.

09:13.889 --> 09:19.868
And innocence comes when you do not destroy
it.

09:19.868 --> 09:25.969
Actually a child is born innocent, but if
the mother is like that, immediately the child

09:25.969 --> 09:32.058
takes over and if the father is like that
the son takes over.

09:32.058 --> 09:36.589
But later on it has effect, whether it’s
mother or father.

09:36.589 --> 09:41.818
The whole society is decadent, is in decadence,
is going down.

09:41.818 --> 09:44.229
You can see it so clearly.

09:44.229 --> 09:54.509
Thanks to certain great saints in India who
made the culture of India, it has not come

09:54.509 --> 10:01.808
from any philosophers or any writers or intellectuals,
but it has come to us from the saints who

10:01.808 --> 10:10.688
understood the value of chastity, and who
understood the value of innocence.

10:10.688 --> 10:16.279
And they have built the whole thing in such
a manner that these things never enter into

10:16.279 --> 10:17.279
our head.

10:17.279 --> 10:22.149
So we call them as susamskaras, means “good
conditionings”.

10:22.149 --> 10:27.449
These good conditionings are surrounding us
so much that this never enters into our head,

10:27.449 --> 10:31.759
all these kind of things that people are doing
here, are mad.

10:31.759 --> 10:43.719
When it doesn’t enter into your head, we
can say that we just do not allow these possessions

10:43.719 --> 10:46.568
to come in.

10:46.568 --> 10:53.558
Because if you make preparation in a way for
these possessions to come in, then the possessions

10:53.558 --> 10:54.618
will be there.

10:54.618 --> 11:00.628
Like the way people dress up nowadays, you
see, they look like really witches or bhoots,

11:00.628 --> 11:01.729
absolutely.

11:01.729 --> 11:06.808
And such people will be definitely attacked,
because the bhoots think that, “These are

11:06.808 --> 11:07.819
someone like us.

11:07.819 --> 11:09.959
Let’s go enter them.”

11:09.959 --> 11:11.719
Also Agnya is not to be covered.

11:11.719 --> 11:15.842
I have told a hundred times, please don’t
cover your Agnya, please clear it down.

11:16.210 --> 11:17.981
Don’t cover your Agnya.

11:17.981 --> 11:22.751
If you cover your Agnya, then you cannot be
protected.

11:22.751 --> 11:29.674
They enter into your Agnya and from Agnya
they can go up to your Mooladhara.

11:29.699 --> 11:36.659
So you are living in atmosphere which is very
dangerous for saints to live.

11:36.659 --> 11:40.309
Actually that’s why they said the saints
must go to Himalaya.

11:40.309 --> 11:47.339
If they could say that to Indians, I don’t
know what should I say to people who live

11:47.339 --> 11:51.765
in such horrible circumstance, absolutely
horrible.

11:51.790 --> 11:59.761
I mean, you think about it, how terrible it
is, and how many problems it gives us; how

11:59.761 --> 12:06.261
many people are ruined, how many children
are ruined, how we go amok.

12:06.332 --> 12:15.342
So the first thing is that we should understand
that Ganesha gives us maryadas, limits, it

12:15.342 --> 12:18.532
is innate within us.

12:18.532 --> 12:23.152
It’s not imposed on us, it is innate.

12:23.152 --> 12:28.621
A little girl if you see, she’s shy, she
knows how to protect herself.

12:28.621 --> 12:38.782
Even the boys, they are shy and they try to
protect themselves, but that innate innocence

12:38.782 --> 12:44.292
we try to flout, because ego is there.

12:44.292 --> 12:45.491
“What’s wrong?”

12:45.491 --> 12:49.092
You tell them anything, “What’s wrong?”

12:49.092 --> 12:54.051
And you do not know how devastating it is.

12:54.051 --> 13:00.251
In London I know of so many parents telling
Me that their children are already squatting,

13:00.251 --> 13:02.991
they have got already children.

13:02.991 --> 13:06.285
At a very young age, about fifteen, sixteen
they

13:06.310 --> 13:07.310
have got children.

13:13.850 --> 13:18.972
And this is so widespread, and so shamelessly
they discuss.

13:18.972 --> 13:23.311
I mean, in the newspaper if you read, I mean
you can’t imagine why to write all these

13:23.311 --> 13:25.662
things in such details in the newspaper.

13:25.662 --> 13:31.462
There’s no need to write each and every
thing in the newspaper.

13:31.462 --> 13:36.852
But basically we are good people.

13:37.062 --> 13:40.602
God has created us good human beings.

13:40.602 --> 13:54.751
We are beautiful people, but this ego and
this kind of a stupid idea that, “What’s

13:54.751 --> 14:00.881
wrong?” in doing anything, coming from ego;
people have gone amok, and when you go amok

14:00.881 --> 14:06.171
you get caught up by these bhoots, and then
once you are caught up by these bhoots, you

14:06.171 --> 14:10.251
start behaving in a manner that no one can
explain.

14:10.251 --> 14:12.792
“Why they behave like this?”

14:12.792 --> 14:15.972
I just don’t understand.

14:15.972 --> 14:23.282
There was a boy who came with all his hair
not properly done and looking funny and with

14:23.282 --> 14:24.992
all these jattas, as we call them.

14:24.992 --> 14:27.682
So I asked him, “Why do you dress up like
this?

14:27.682 --> 14:29.631
You look like a primitive man.”

14:29.631 --> 14:31.931
He said, “I want to be primitive.”

14:31.931 --> 14:33.881
I said, “You cannot.

14:33.881 --> 14:35.532
Your brain is modern.

14:35.532 --> 14:39.321
By just making such hair, are you going to
become primitive?

14:39.321 --> 14:41.941
You cannot become primitive.”

14:41.941 --> 14:45.922
But just imagine, all these external things
they do.

14:45.922 --> 14:46.972
For what?

14:46.972 --> 14:49.602
To have an identity.

14:49.602 --> 14:56.982
Now this idea of identity is also is a sign
that you do not have your maryadas.

14:56.982 --> 14:57.982
You can do anything.

14:57.982 --> 15:01.222
You can become a punk and all kinds of things
you do.

15:01.222 --> 15:03.982
I mean, there are no maryadas.

15:03.982 --> 15:07.102
And that means you are denying Ganesha completely.

15:07.102 --> 15:15.052
Ganesha has created those maryadas innately
within us.

15:15.052 --> 15:20.222
Even a prostitute in India, if she has to
take to that profession because she’s forced

15:20.222 --> 15:26.102
into it, maybe she’s been brought from somewhere
or maybe that out of her big problems she

15:26.102 --> 15:31.392
might have been a prostitute; she will see
that her child is saved.

15:31.392 --> 15:32.811
She knows that it’s wrong.

15:32.811 --> 15:37.121
But here it is so bad that we do not know
also that it is wrong.

15:37.121 --> 15:43.082
Can you imagine, this is the limit of things,
that you see yourself getting drowned in the

15:43.082 --> 15:46.201
water and you know that you are going to be
killed.

15:46.201 --> 15:49.861
Still you are enjoying, “Very nice, I am
going to be killed.”

15:49.861 --> 15:52.671
This is the situation of the wisdom.

15:52.671 --> 15:55.571
This is really shocking.

15:55.571 --> 16:00.872
So we have to now understand what are our
maryadas are, how we have to live within our

16:00.872 --> 16:06.821
maryadas, and I’m sure if you really work
out your Shri Ganesha.

16:06.821 --> 16:10.191
For that the best is to meditate.

16:10.191 --> 16:17.741
Put yourself on some nice turf, grass.

16:17.741 --> 16:18.741
Sit on that.

16:18.741 --> 16:26.511
Put your left hand with the light, and right
hand on the Mother Earth, and say Atharva

16:26.511 --> 16:27.582
Sheersha.

16:27.582 --> 16:30.171
If you can remember it by heart, it’s a
very good thing.

16:30.171 --> 16:36.282
Otherwise, you can keep the book and read
it, or say Ganesha’s mantra to begin with.

16:36.282 --> 16:38.481
It’s going to help you very much.

16:38.481 --> 16:43.511
It’s going to help you, your eyes, it’s
going to your whole thing, is going to be

16:43.511 --> 16:45.481
very nice.

16:45.481 --> 16:53.142
And also with this kind of a mad Mooladhara,
a woman can become extremely aggressive with

16:53.142 --> 16:54.142
her husband.

16:54.142 --> 16:59.072
I mean, she can be a very cruel woman, and
that’s what is happening in America now.

16:59.072 --> 17:02.552
But I can’t understand how women could be
that cruel.

17:02.552 --> 17:05.442
I mean, I never used to think women could
be cruel, really.

17:05.442 --> 17:16.232
I mean they could be sly, they could be sort
of, doing some scandal-mongering or some sort

17:16.232 --> 17:19.382
of stupid things like that.

17:19.382 --> 17:25.332
But that a woman should be a cruel woman…
when I first read the history of England I

17:25.332 --> 17:31.102
was surprised that there were some queens
who were very cruel, and also that there were

17:31.102 --> 17:33.432
seven queens who were killed.

17:33.432 --> 17:42.075
In India if a king kills even one queen, he’ll
be ousted completely from the whole country.

18:36.192 --> 18:39.677
So it’s not a

18:39.702 --> 18:41.582
something very simple thing.

18:41.582 --> 18:43.272
It’s very serious.

18:43.272 --> 18:48.392
For Sahaja yogis very, very serious.

18:48.392 --> 18:55.142
They have to revive their innocence.

18:55.142 --> 18:59.452
They have to revive their maryadas.

18:59.452 --> 19:01.502
They have to delimit themselves.

19:01.502 --> 19:04.042
It’s very important.

19:04.042 --> 19:12.092
Otherwise, I would say that, if you have some
wheat spread out everywhere, how can you reach

19:12.092 --> 19:13.602
the heights?

19:13.602 --> 19:17.262
You have to put them into some bags, some
maryadas.

19:17.262 --> 19:23.262
Only by maryadas you can rise.

19:23.262 --> 19:25.772
Of course the kundalini will help.

19:25.772 --> 19:28.192
Of course Ganesha will help also.

19:28.192 --> 19:32.392
But we should also try to watch ourselves.

19:32.392 --> 19:38.592
There should be introspection, “Are we still
in the same category?”

19:38.592 --> 19:46.912
I have told many people that it is better
you walk with your eyes towards the grass,

19:46.912 --> 19:52.152
at only at three feet, because at three feet
you can only see children, flowers and grounds,

19:52.152 --> 19:54.712
not higher than that.

19:54.712 --> 19:58.382
Nothing very beautiful is beyond that I think.

19:58.382 --> 20:07.701
Or raise much higher, so that you just see
above the heads of people, nothing in between.

20:07.726 --> 20:19.018
And our whole style, lifestyle is so funny;
I mean, I just don’t know how to explain

20:19.043 --> 20:22.292
it, but is accepted.

20:22.292 --> 20:29.722
Yesterday there was an Indian, and very seriously
he came and told Me, “I have been committing

20:29.722 --> 20:31.802
one sin, so I must tell you.”

20:31.802 --> 20:32.802
I said, “What?”

20:32.802 --> 20:36.722
“In my family nobody takes beer, but I am
taking beer sometimes.”

20:36.722 --> 20:45.631
After that, I didn’t know where to look
and what to say.

20:45.656 --> 20:51.862
Very seriously he said, “You are Mother,
so I must confess to You, but now I will never

20:51.862 --> 20:52.923
touch beer.”

20:52.948 --> 20:54.432
Imagine.

20:54.432 --> 21:00.512
Very seriously he was talking, and another
fellow came, he has told Me.

21:00.512 --> 21:04.282
I said, “Now you Indians don’t want to
come to this thing.

21:04.282 --> 21:05.282
What is it?

21:05.282 --> 21:06.492
You are all making money?”

21:06.492 --> 21:10.982
He said, “We have made a lot of money here
and we don’t want any money.”

21:10.982 --> 21:13.112
But I said, “Then why don’t you come?

21:13.112 --> 21:16.022
You should come and take your, to Sahaja Yoga.

21:16.022 --> 21:17.022
Why not?”

21:17.022 --> 21:21.152
He said, “You see, Mother, mostly the trouble
is…”

21:21.152 --> 21:25.342
With very great hesitation, he said that,
“You see, mostly it is not advertised in

21:25.342 --> 21:30.722
Indian papers, and we Indians think that we
are rather of a different species, you see,

21:30.722 --> 21:35.892
how are we going to fit in with these people
because, you see, their ideas are so different,

21:35.892 --> 21:40.192
ours are so different, and how are we going
to fit in with them?

21:40.192 --> 21:42.222
It’s very difficult.

21:42.222 --> 21:47.072
But this time I saw some Indians also and
some Indian musicians singing, so it seems

21:47.072 --> 21:49.752
that we can fit into them.”

21:49.752 --> 21:53.232
“Yes,” I said, “They can fit in to you
and you can fit in to them.

21:53.232 --> 21:54.232
It’s easy.

21:54.232 --> 21:55.232
They are your style only.”

21:55.232 --> 22:00.022
He said, “We were really enamored how they
were nice, you see, and they were.”

22:00.022 --> 22:04.282
Because they do not consider that these things
are bad or anything.

22:04.282 --> 22:05.682
India is like that, you see.

22:05.682 --> 22:09.412
They think you are of a different bottle and
they are of a different bottle.

22:09.412 --> 22:12.592
So you are like that and they are like that.

22:12.592 --> 22:17.782
They cannot be like you and you cannot be
like them, so they think it is a different

22:17.782 --> 22:21.402
bottle you belong to, you see, different category
of people.

22:21.402 --> 22:25.552
But they don’t think that you are bad or
good, they don’t pass judgment.

22:25.552 --> 22:31.932
But this is what it is, that we have to understand
that we have gone too far with this madness,

22:31.932 --> 22:34.502
spoiling our Shri Ganesha.

22:34.502 --> 22:43.662
Also Australians have to give a very big lead
in Shri Ganesha’s area because you are sitting

22:43.662 --> 22:48.052
on the soil of Shri Ganesha.

22:48.052 --> 22:50.752
To all the Sahaja yogis, you must show.

22:50.752 --> 22:57.552
But, as you know what, we had horrible experiences
so far, and how people have been dominating

22:57.552 --> 23:07.702
and doing all kinds of nonsensical things,
money-wise and otherwise also morality-wise.

23:07.702 --> 23:16.622
So it sometimes upsets the whole balance of
Sahaja Yoga because it’s all depending on

23:16.622 --> 23:22.942
Shri Ganesha; that means depending on Australians.

23:22.942 --> 23:31.202
And Australians have all the possibility of
reaching a great height in Ganesh principle,

23:31.202 --> 23:34.952
because they have the Mother Earth here sitting
down.

23:34.952 --> 23:38.042
What else do they want?

23:38.042 --> 23:41.642
You need not take to stupid American-style
things.

23:41.642 --> 23:47.182
I mean, if you see their Hallowe’en, I tell
you, you won’t eat your food for eight days.

23:47.182 --> 23:53.772
And if you go only to Rio, even you do not
visit their carnivals, but even if you see

23:53.772 --> 23:58.872
the pictures, you won’t eat your food for
one month, so horrible they are.

23:58.872 --> 24:09.112
So are we going to follow them, or are we
going to start our own Australian Shri Ganesha’s

24:09.112 --> 24:11.652
special people?

24:11.652 --> 24:23.562
Or, this I have to warn you, and people are
all watching all over, all Sahaja yogis are

24:23.562 --> 24:26.962
there; you know that all over the world we
have Sahaja yogis.

24:26.962 --> 24:34.192
They’re watching everyone, and you have
to do your maximum to express your Ganesh

24:34.192 --> 24:39.322
principle, which should be very easy for you.

24:39.322 --> 24:43.992
And as I have told you, that Australia was
a part and parcel of India once upon a time.

24:43.992 --> 24:46.542
It has come down here.

24:46.542 --> 24:52.242
So, at least in your films and all that, you
can say they’re dharmic, they are dharmic.

24:52.242 --> 25:00.752
They’re not so bad as the American films
are, but still this idea of copying the French

25:00.752 --> 25:05.162
or the Americans shows that we have lost our
personality.

25:05.162 --> 25:09.212
But Shri Ganesha gives you a personality.

25:09.212 --> 25:13.012
He gives you your personality, because He
gives you maryadas.

25:13.012 --> 25:16.092
You see, by maryadas only, you get your personality.

25:16.092 --> 25:19.122
A person is known by his maryadas.

25:19.122 --> 25:23.582
And that’s what has to come within us, are
our maryadas.

25:23.582 --> 25:26.622
So today’s puja is about Shri Ganesha.

25:26.622 --> 25:32.032
As of course you know, He has got four petals
and you know what He is placed in and what

25:32.032 --> 25:37.162
He does and all that, and how He looks after
the chastity of His Mother and all that.

25:37.162 --> 25:44.042
But the main thing is that how we develop
Shri Ganesha within us, how people see us

25:44.042 --> 25:49.492
as the incarnations of innocence on this Earth.

25:49.492 --> 25:57.662
I know it’s very difficult, but imagine
Shri Ganesha sitting on the gate of hell,

25:57.662 --> 26:04.692
of excretion, because He’s just like a lotus,
above everything else, and He makes everything

26:04.692 --> 26:05.732
fragrant.

26:05.732 --> 26:12.662
In the same way I expect all of you, the Sahaja
yogis of Australia, to have that beautiful

26:12.662 --> 26:22.712
personality of Shri Ganesha, and that you
emit that fragrance of innocence among all

26:22.712 --> 26:25.682
the Sahaja yogis, and then among all the world.

26:25.682 --> 26:28.890
May God bless you.
