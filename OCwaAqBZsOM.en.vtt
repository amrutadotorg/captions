00:00:03.352 --> 00:00:10.416
I don’t know what to tell you more about
Shri Ganesh, because really it is so important

00:00:10.416 --> 00:00:19.331
that we have to know the importance of Mooladhara
Chakra.

00:00:19.378 --> 00:00:36.188
If you read the newspaper, just on the first
page you find people going amok as far as

00:00:36.213 --> 00:00:41.516
their moral sense is concerned, absolutely
I mean, to us it is something so shocking,

00:00:41.516 --> 00:00:50.818
and perhaps I think people are possessed on
their Mooladhara Chakra.

00:00:50.843 --> 00:00:58.735
The way they behave one feels that there’s
something gone wrong with them completely

00:00:58.774 --> 00:01:07.259
and they have no control over themselves;
and just like mad people they are behaving.

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:13.539
And all these problems that are coming, of
these perversions, are due to this kind of

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:17.729
a possession on the Mooladhara Chakra.

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:23.969
One has to be very, very careful and respectful
about it.

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:29.559
I have already told so many things how to
keep it clean, how to respect it and how to

00:01:29.559 --> 00:01:34.969
behave yourself.

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:46.969
As you know, Shri Ganesha was created
at the gate of hell to protect us from falling

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:49.349
into hell.

00:01:49.349 --> 00:02:01.079
But actually when we insult Him and we do
not care for Him, He just sleeps off.

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:12.249
When that happens, any kind of a possession
can come and can really make people mad.

00:02:12.249 --> 00:02:21.589
When you come from India to these places you
are really surprised and shocked.

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:27.589
What is wrong with these people, how can they
be behaving in this manner?

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:33.788
How can they go all out to ruin themselves
like this?

00:02:33.788 --> 00:02:41.259
And how is it they do not understand the importance
of morality when they are following Christ?

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:48.229
The Christians, I think, are the worst as
far as morality is concerned.

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:50.659
They have no moral values left in them.

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:58.788
It’s such a sad thing that the number of
people killed by Christians is also the maximum.

00:02:58.788 --> 00:03:06.159
Sometimes I think these people who were killed
everywhere might have possessed the Christians

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:13.428
this way, that they are just going amok and
behaving in this manner, destroying themselves.

00:03:13.428 --> 00:03:22.759
Now the first quality of Shri Ganesha is that
He gives us wisdom.

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:29.928
And that wisdom gives us the sense how to
behave, gives us the balance, and gives us

00:03:29.928 --> 00:03:41.009
the sense how to behave towards ourselves,
how to preserve yourself, how to respect yourself.

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:52.879
But if Ganesha is not at all there to watch
you, might be from hell some horrible hellish

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:57.519
bhoots are coming out, or I don’t know,
I cannot explain this kind of a thing.

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:04.099
But the other way round, I’ll tell you,
in India, is specially with women, they are

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:11.598
extremely particular about their chastity,
extremely particular.

00:04:11.598 --> 00:04:19.499
Like we had a queen called Padmini, and she
was a very beautiful woman.

00:04:19.499 --> 00:04:25.879
And one Muslim aggressor who became sultan
heard about her beauty.

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:30.059
So he wanted to see her.

00:04:30.059 --> 00:04:33.739
So she refused, “I don’t want to see him.”

00:04:33.739 --> 00:04:43.778
Even seeing a woman like that: those bad eyes,
are bad; seeing a woman also, are bad.

00:04:43.778 --> 00:04:50.119
So he said, “If you do not allow me to see
her, I’ll invade your country.”

00:04:50.119 --> 00:04:56.198
So she agreed that, “All right, he can see
me in a mirror, so at least his bad eyes don’t

00:04:56.198 --> 00:04:57.769
fall on me directly.”

00:04:57.769 --> 00:04:58.869
She agreed to that.

00:04:58.869 --> 00:05:07.668
And he saw her in a mirror, and he saw that
it was even more beautiful than he had thought

00:05:07.668 --> 00:05:08.829
her to be.

00:05:08.829 --> 00:05:11.068
So now he wanted to have her.

00:05:11.068 --> 00:05:15.129
So physical, so superficial.

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:21.608
And he said, “If you now do not come to
me, I will again attack.”

00:05:21.608 --> 00:05:28.249
So they made a plan, “Let us now decide
whether we are going to surrender our queen

00:05:28.249 --> 00:05:29.249
or not.”

00:05:29.249 --> 00:05:30.249
So everybody said, “Nothing doing.

00:05:30.249 --> 00:05:31.959
We are not going to surrender.”

00:05:31.959 --> 00:05:42.119
Because the chastity of a woman is very important,
and that of a queen, and a queen, who is representative

00:05:42.119 --> 00:05:47.038
of all the womanhood should not be sacrificed
like this.

00:05:47.038 --> 00:05:49.948
They could not bear the idea.

00:05:49.948 --> 00:05:57.098
So they said that, “All right, we’ll organize
something and cheat these people.”

00:05:57.098 --> 00:06:01.628
So they sent a word, “All right, we are
all coming and the queen is coming too.”

00:06:01.628 --> 00:06:03.348
And they sent hundred palanquins.

00:06:03.348 --> 00:06:07.929
We use palanquins for ladies in India, covered.

00:06:07.929 --> 00:06:14.038
And inside every palanquin there was one warrior
sitting with all the weapons.

00:06:14.038 --> 00:06:19.299
And there were four carrying the palanquin,
and all these four were also warriors.

00:06:19.299 --> 00:06:23.598
So thus they have about five hundred warriors.

00:06:23.598 --> 00:06:27.649
It was a small kingdom.

00:06:27.649 --> 00:06:31.989
So when they went down, these people were
very happy.

00:06:31.989 --> 00:06:32.989
“The queen is coming.”

00:06:32.989 --> 00:06:37.489
and they were all getting drunk and celebrating
it.

00:06:37.489 --> 00:06:38.878
“The queen is coming.

00:06:38.878 --> 00:06:39.878
Queen is coming.”

00:06:39.878 --> 00:06:41.498
So they were half drunk also.

00:06:41.498 --> 00:06:47.808
They had told these women that, “In case
we win, then we lit a fire and you will know

00:06:47.808 --> 00:06:49.909
that we have won.

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:57.108
But if you do not see any thing like that,
then be sure that we have lost the war.”

00:06:57.108 --> 00:07:02.549
So the king sat in the front palanquin, and
the rest of them, and they went and attacked

00:07:02.549 --> 00:07:07.618
them in the sense that they first entered
inside, and then instead of the queen, the

00:07:07.618 --> 00:07:11.218
king came out and they all fought those people.

00:07:11.218 --> 00:07:16.299
But they were only five hundred so they could
not be saved, and these people had better

00:07:16.299 --> 00:07:19.239
weapons, so they were killed.

00:07:19.239 --> 00:07:21.769
They did not lit the fire.

00:07:21.769 --> 00:07:24.028
Now the women knew that all of them will be
coming.

00:07:24.028 --> 00:07:29.618
Now they were very rich sultans, very rich
Muslims, and things like that.

00:07:29.618 --> 00:07:36.358
But they thought that now their chastity is
in danger, so there was a big platform and

00:07:36.358 --> 00:07:37.968
they made a big pyre on that.

00:07:37.968 --> 00:07:48.598
And they all entered into it and killed themselves,
before they could enter and touch their body.

00:07:48.598 --> 00:07:56.068
So for women specially it is very important
to have a great sense of chastity.

00:07:56.068 --> 00:08:02.198
And if they do not have the great sense of
chastity, then they develop all kinds of funny

00:08:02.198 --> 00:08:07.408
ideas and mentally they become very imbalanced.

00:08:07.408 --> 00:08:13.549
And the children that they have, also become
very funny and you have all these problems

00:08:13.549 --> 00:08:17.258
of perverted relations, incest relations.

00:08:17.258 --> 00:08:24.019
And today I read a horrible story about a
little girl who suffered with this incest

00:08:24.019 --> 00:08:26.479
relationship.

00:08:26.479 --> 00:08:33.589
It’s hell that we have created.

00:08:33.589 --> 00:08:36.616
In hell what else is going to be?

00:08:38.587 --> 00:08:40.795
Same thing.

00:08:40.866 --> 00:08:45.569
There’s no sanity about it, there’s no
wisdom about it.

00:08:45.569 --> 00:08:54.649
So we have to now understand how we have to
build ourselves as Sahaja yogis.

00:08:54.649 --> 00:09:01.308
Men and women, all of them, have to go hand
in hand, because the first quality I told

00:09:01.308 --> 00:09:07.302
is wisdom, but the essence of Mooladhara is
innocence.

00:09:07.326 --> 00:09:10.565
They are made of innocence.

00:09:10.799 --> 00:09:13.889
The power of Ganesha is innocence.

00:09:13.889 --> 00:09:19.868
And innocence comes when you do not destroy
it.

00:09:19.868 --> 00:09:25.969
Actually a child is born innocent, but if
the mother is like that, immediately the child

00:09:25.969 --> 00:09:32.058
takes over and if the father is like that
the son takes over.

00:09:32.058 --> 00:09:36.589
But later on it has effect, whether it’s
mother or father.

00:09:36.589 --> 00:09:41.818
The whole society is decadent, is in decadence,
is going down.

00:09:41.818 --> 00:09:44.229
You can see it so clearly.

00:09:44.229 --> 00:09:54.509
Thanks to certain great saints in India who
made the culture of India, it has not come

00:09:54.509 --> 00:10:01.808
from any philosophers or any writers or intellectuals,
but it has come to us from the saints who

00:10:01.808 --> 00:10:10.688
understood the value of chastity, and who
understood the value of innocence.

00:10:10.688 --> 00:10:16.279
And they have built the whole thing in such
a manner that these things never enter into

00:10:16.279 --> 00:10:17.279
our head.

00:10:17.279 --> 00:10:22.149
So we call them as susamskaras, means “good
conditionings”.

00:10:22.149 --> 00:10:27.449
These good conditionings are surrounding us
so much that this never enters into our head,

00:10:27.449 --> 00:10:31.759
all these kind of things that people are doing
here, are mad.

00:10:31.759 --> 00:10:43.719
When it doesn’t enter into your head, we
can say that we just do not allow these possessions

00:10:43.719 --> 00:10:46.568
to come in.

00:10:46.568 --> 00:10:53.558
Because if you make preparation in a way for
these possessions to come in, then the possessions

00:10:53.558 --> 00:10:54.618
will be there.

00:10:54.618 --> 00:11:00.628
Like the way people dress up nowadays, you
see, they look like really witches or bhoots,

00:11:00.628 --> 00:11:01.729
absolutely.

00:11:01.729 --> 00:11:06.808
And such people will be definitely attacked,
because the bhoots think that, “These are

00:11:06.808 --> 00:11:07.819
someone like us.

00:11:07.819 --> 00:11:09.959
Let’s go enter them.”

00:11:09.959 --> 00:11:11.719
Also Agnya is not to be covered.

00:11:11.719 --> 00:11:15.842
I have told a hundred times, please don’t
cover your Agnya, please clear it down.

00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:17.981
Don’t cover your Agnya.

00:11:17.981 --> 00:11:22.751
If you cover your Agnya, then you cannot be
protected.

00:11:22.751 --> 00:11:29.674
They enter into your Agnya and from Agnya
they can go up to your Mooladhara.

00:11:29.699 --> 00:11:36.659
So you are living in atmosphere which is very
dangerous for saints to live.

00:11:36.659 --> 00:11:40.309
Actually that’s why they said the saints
must go to Himalaya.

00:11:40.309 --> 00:11:47.339
If they could say that to Indians, I don’t
know what should I say to people who live

00:11:47.339 --> 00:11:51.765
in such horrible circumstance, absolutely
horrible.

00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:59.761
I mean, you think about it, how terrible it
is, and how many problems it gives us; how

00:11:59.761 --> 00:12:06.261
many people are ruined, how many children
are ruined, how we go amok.

00:12:06.332 --> 00:12:15.342
So the first thing is that we should understand
that Ganesha gives us maryadas, limits, it

00:12:15.342 --> 00:12:18.532
is innate within us.

00:12:18.532 --> 00:12:23.152
It’s not imposed on us, it is innate.

00:12:23.152 --> 00:12:28.621
A little girl if you see, she’s shy, she
knows how to protect herself.

00:12:28.621 --> 00:12:38.782
Even the boys, they are shy and they try to
protect themselves, but that innate innocence

00:12:38.782 --> 00:12:44.292
we try to flout, because ego is there.

00:12:44.292 --> 00:12:45.491
“What’s wrong?”

00:12:45.491 --> 00:12:49.092
You tell them anything, “What’s wrong?”

00:12:49.092 --> 00:12:54.051
And you do not know how devastating it is.

00:12:54.051 --> 00:13:00.251
In London I know of so many parents telling
Me that their children are already squatting,

00:13:00.251 --> 00:13:02.991
they have got already children.

00:13:02.991 --> 00:13:06.285
At a very young age, about fifteen, sixteen
they

00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:07.310
have got children.

00:13:13.850 --> 00:13:18.972
And this is so widespread, and so shamelessly
they discuss.

00:13:18.972 --> 00:13:23.311
I mean, in the newspaper if you read, I mean
you can’t imagine why to write all these

00:13:23.311 --> 00:13:25.662
things in such details in the newspaper.

00:13:25.662 --> 00:13:31.462
There’s no need to write each and every
thing in the newspaper.

00:13:31.462 --> 00:13:36.852
But basically we are good people.

00:13:37.062 --> 00:13:40.602
God has created us good human beings.

00:13:40.602 --> 00:13:54.751
We are beautiful people, but this ego and
this kind of a stupid idea that, “What’s

00:13:54.751 --> 00:14:00.881
wrong?” in doing anything, coming from ego;
people have gone amok, and when you go amok

00:14:00.881 --> 00:14:06.171
you get caught up by these bhoots, and then
once you are caught up by these bhoots, you

00:14:06.171 --> 00:14:10.251
start behaving in a manner that no one can
explain.

00:14:10.251 --> 00:14:12.792
“Why they behave like this?”

00:14:12.792 --> 00:14:15.972
I just don’t understand.

00:14:15.972 --> 00:14:23.282
There was a boy who came with all his hair
not properly done and looking funny and with

00:14:23.282 --> 00:14:24.992
all these jattas, as we call them.

00:14:24.992 --> 00:14:27.682
So I asked him, “Why do you dress up like
this?

00:14:27.682 --> 00:14:29.631
You look like a primitive man.”

00:14:29.631 --> 00:14:31.931
He said, “I want to be primitive.”

00:14:31.931 --> 00:14:33.881
I said, “You cannot.

00:14:33.881 --> 00:14:35.532
Your brain is modern.

00:14:35.532 --> 00:14:39.321
By just making such hair, are you going to
become primitive?

00:14:39.321 --> 00:14:41.941
You cannot become primitive.”

00:14:41.941 --> 00:14:45.922
But just imagine, all these external things
they do.

00:14:45.922 --> 00:14:46.972
For what?

00:14:46.972 --> 00:14:49.602
To have an identity.

00:14:49.602 --> 00:14:56.982
Now this idea of identity is also is a sign
that you do not have your maryadas.

00:14:56.982 --> 00:14:57.982
You can do anything.

00:14:57.982 --> 00:15:01.222
You can become a punk and all kinds of things
you do.

00:15:01.222 --> 00:15:03.982
I mean, there are no maryadas.

00:15:03.982 --> 00:15:07.102
And that means you are denying Ganesha completely.

00:15:07.102 --> 00:15:15.052
Ganesha has created those maryadas innately
within us.

00:15:15.052 --> 00:15:20.222
Even a prostitute in India, if she has to
take to that profession because she’s forced

00:15:20.222 --> 00:15:26.102
into it, maybe she’s been brought from somewhere
or maybe that out of her big problems she

00:15:26.102 --> 00:15:31.392
might have been a prostitute; she will see
that her child is saved.

00:15:31.392 --> 00:15:32.811
She knows that it’s wrong.

00:15:32.811 --> 00:15:37.121
But here it is so bad that we do not know
also that it is wrong.

00:15:37.121 --> 00:15:43.082
Can you imagine, this is the limit of things,
that you see yourself getting drowned in the

00:15:43.082 --> 00:15:46.201
water and you know that you are going to be
killed.

00:15:46.201 --> 00:15:49.861
Still you are enjoying, “Very nice, I am
going to be killed.”

00:15:49.861 --> 00:15:52.671
This is the situation of the wisdom.

00:15:52.671 --> 00:15:55.571
This is really shocking.

00:15:55.571 --> 00:16:00.872
So we have to now understand what are our
maryadas are, how we have to live within our

00:16:00.872 --> 00:16:06.821
maryadas, and I’m sure if you really work
out your Shri Ganesha.

00:16:06.821 --> 00:16:10.191
For that the best is to meditate.

00:16:10.191 --> 00:16:17.741
Put yourself on some nice turf, grass.

00:16:17.741 --> 00:16:18.741
Sit on that.

00:16:18.741 --> 00:16:26.511
Put your left hand with the light, and right
hand on the Mother Earth, and say Atharva

00:16:26.511 --> 00:16:27.582
Sheersha.

00:16:27.582 --> 00:16:30.171
If you can remember it by heart, it’s a
very good thing.

00:16:30.171 --> 00:16:36.282
Otherwise, you can keep the book and read
it, or say Ganesha’s mantra to begin with.

00:16:36.282 --> 00:16:38.481
It’s going to help you very much.

00:16:38.481 --> 00:16:43.511
It’s going to help you, your eyes, it’s
going to your whole thing, is going to be

00:16:43.511 --> 00:16:45.481
very nice.

00:16:45.481 --> 00:16:53.142
And also with this kind of a mad Mooladhara,
a woman can become extremely aggressive with

00:16:53.142 --> 00:16:54.142
her husband.

00:16:54.142 --> 00:16:59.072
I mean, she can be a very cruel woman, and
that’s what is happening in America now.

00:16:59.072 --> 00:17:02.552
But I can’t understand how women could be
that cruel.

00:17:02.552 --> 00:17:05.442
I mean, I never used to think women could
be cruel, really.

00:17:05.442 --> 00:17:16.232
I mean they could be sly, they could be sort
of, doing some scandal-mongering or some sort

00:17:16.232 --> 00:17:19.382
of stupid things like that.

00:17:19.382 --> 00:17:25.332
But that a woman should be a cruel woman…
when I first read the history of England I

00:17:25.332 --> 00:17:31.102
was surprised that there were some queens
who were very cruel, and also that there were

00:17:31.102 --> 00:17:33.432
seven queens who were killed.

00:17:33.432 --> 00:17:42.075
In India if a king kills even one queen, he’ll
be ousted completely from the whole country.

00:18:36.192 --> 00:18:39.677
So it’s not a

00:18:39.702 --> 00:18:41.582
something very simple thing.

00:18:41.582 --> 00:18:43.272
It’s very serious.

00:18:43.272 --> 00:18:48.392
For Sahaja yogis very, very serious.

00:18:48.392 --> 00:18:55.142
They have to revive their innocence.

00:18:55.142 --> 00:18:59.452
They have to revive their maryadas.

00:18:59.452 --> 00:19:01.502
They have to delimit themselves.

00:19:01.502 --> 00:19:04.042
It’s very important.

00:19:04.042 --> 00:19:12.092
Otherwise, I would say that, if you have some
wheat spread out everywhere, how can you reach

00:19:12.092 --> 00:19:13.602
the heights?

00:19:13.602 --> 00:19:17.262
You have to put them into some bags, some
maryadas.

00:19:17.262 --> 00:19:23.262
Only by maryadas you can rise.

00:19:23.262 --> 00:19:25.772
Of course the kundalini will help.

00:19:25.772 --> 00:19:28.192
Of course Ganesha will help also.

00:19:28.192 --> 00:19:32.392
But we should also try to watch ourselves.

00:19:32.392 --> 00:19:38.592
There should be introspection, “Are we still
in the same category?”

00:19:38.592 --> 00:19:46.912
I have told many people that it is better
you walk with your eyes towards the grass,

00:19:46.912 --> 00:19:52.152
at only at three feet, because at three feet
you can only see children, flowers and grounds,

00:19:52.152 --> 00:19:54.712
not higher than that.

00:19:54.712 --> 00:19:58.382
Nothing very beautiful is beyond that I think.

00:19:58.382 --> 00:20:07.701
Or raise much higher, so that you just see
above the heads of people, nothing in between.

00:20:07.726 --> 00:20:19.018
And our whole style, lifestyle is so funny;
I mean, I just don’t know how to explain

00:20:19.043 --> 00:20:22.292
it, but is accepted.

00:20:22.292 --> 00:20:29.722
Yesterday there was an Indian, and very seriously
he came and told Me, “I have been committing

00:20:29.722 --> 00:20:31.802
one sin, so I must tell you.”

00:20:31.802 --> 00:20:32.802
I said, “What?”

00:20:32.802 --> 00:20:36.722
“In my family nobody takes beer, but I am
taking beer sometimes.”

00:20:36.722 --> 00:20:45.631
After that, I didn’t know where to look
and what to say.

00:20:45.656 --> 00:20:51.862
Very seriously he said, “You are Mother,
so I must confess to You, but now I will never

00:20:51.862 --> 00:20:52.923
touch beer.”

00:20:52.948 --> 00:20:54.432
Imagine.

00:20:54.432 --> 00:21:00.512
Very seriously he was talking, and another
fellow came, he has told Me.

00:21:00.512 --> 00:21:04.282
I said, “Now you Indians don’t want to
come to this thing.

00:21:04.282 --> 00:21:05.282
What is it?

00:21:05.282 --> 00:21:06.492
You are all making money?”

00:21:06.492 --> 00:21:10.982
He said, “We have made a lot of money here
and we don’t want any money.”

00:21:10.982 --> 00:21:13.112
But I said, “Then why don’t you come?

00:21:13.112 --> 00:21:16.022
You should come and take your, to Sahaja Yoga.

00:21:16.022 --> 00:21:17.022
Why not?”

00:21:17.022 --> 00:21:21.152
He said, “You see, Mother, mostly the trouble
is…”

00:21:21.152 --> 00:21:25.342
With very great hesitation, he said that,
“You see, mostly it is not advertised in

00:21:25.342 --> 00:21:30.722
Indian papers, and we Indians think that we
are rather of a different species, you see,

00:21:30.722 --> 00:21:35.892
how are we going to fit in with these people
because, you see, their ideas are so different,

00:21:35.892 --> 00:21:40.192
ours are so different, and how are we going
to fit in with them?

00:21:40.192 --> 00:21:42.222
It’s very difficult.

00:21:42.222 --> 00:21:47.072
But this time I saw some Indians also and
some Indian musicians singing, so it seems

00:21:47.072 --> 00:21:49.752
that we can fit into them.”

00:21:49.752 --> 00:21:53.232
“Yes,” I said, “They can fit in to you
and you can fit in to them.

00:21:53.232 --> 00:21:54.232
It’s easy.

00:21:54.232 --> 00:21:55.232
They are your style only.”

00:21:55.232 --> 00:22:00.022
He said, “We were really enamored how they
were nice, you see, and they were.”

00:22:00.022 --> 00:22:04.282
Because they do not consider that these things
are bad or anything.

00:22:04.282 --> 00:22:05.682
India is like that, you see.

00:22:05.682 --> 00:22:09.412
They think you are of a different bottle and
they are of a different bottle.

00:22:09.412 --> 00:22:12.592
So you are like that and they are like that.

00:22:12.592 --> 00:22:17.782
They cannot be like you and you cannot be
like them, so they think it is a different

00:22:17.782 --> 00:22:21.402
bottle you belong to, you see, different category
of people.

00:22:21.402 --> 00:22:25.552
But they don’t think that you are bad or
good, they don’t pass judgment.

00:22:25.552 --> 00:22:31.932
But this is what it is, that we have to understand
that we have gone too far with this madness,

00:22:31.932 --> 00:22:34.502
spoiling our Shri Ganesha.

00:22:34.502 --> 00:22:43.662
Also Australians have to give a very big lead
in Shri Ganesha’s area because you are sitting

00:22:43.662 --> 00:22:48.052
on the soil of Shri Ganesha.

00:22:48.052 --> 00:22:50.752
To all the Sahaja yogis, you must show.

00:22:50.752 --> 00:22:57.552
But, as you know what, we had horrible experiences
so far, and how people have been dominating

00:22:57.552 --> 00:23:07.702
and doing all kinds of nonsensical things,
money-wise and otherwise also morality-wise.

00:23:07.702 --> 00:23:16.622
So it sometimes upsets the whole balance of
Sahaja Yoga because it’s all depending on

00:23:16.622 --> 00:23:22.942
Shri Ganesha; that means depending on Australians.

00:23:22.942 --> 00:23:31.202
And Australians have all the possibility of
reaching a great height in Ganesh principle,

00:23:31.202 --> 00:23:34.952
because they have the Mother Earth here sitting
down.

00:23:34.952 --> 00:23:38.042
What else do they want?

00:23:38.042 --> 00:23:41.642
You need not take to stupid American-style
things.

00:23:41.642 --> 00:23:47.182
I mean, if you see their Hallowe’en, I tell
you, you won’t eat your food for eight days.

00:23:47.182 --> 00:23:53.772
And if you go only to Rio, even you do not
visit their carnivals, but even if you see

00:23:53.772 --> 00:23:58.872
the pictures, you won’t eat your food for
one month, so horrible they are.

00:23:58.872 --> 00:24:09.112
So are we going to follow them, or are we
going to start our own Australian Shri Ganesha’s

00:24:09.112 --> 00:24:11.652
special people?

00:24:11.652 --> 00:24:23.562
Or, this I have to warn you, and people are
all watching all over, all Sahaja yogis are

00:24:23.562 --> 00:24:26.962
there; you know that all over the world we
have Sahaja yogis.

00:24:26.962 --> 00:24:34.192
They’re watching everyone, and you have
to do your maximum to express your Ganesh

00:24:34.192 --> 00:24:39.322
principle, which should be very easy for you.

00:24:39.322 --> 00:24:43.992
And as I have told you, that Australia was
a part and parcel of India once upon a time.

00:24:43.992 --> 00:24:46.542
It has come down here.

00:24:46.542 --> 00:24:52.242
So, at least in your films and all that, you
can say they’re dharmic, they are dharmic.

00:24:52.242 --> 00:25:00.752
They’re not so bad as the American films
are, but still this idea of copying the French

00:25:00.752 --> 00:25:05.162
or the Americans shows that we have lost our
personality.

00:25:05.162 --> 00:25:09.212
But Shri Ganesha gives you a personality.

00:25:09.212 --> 00:25:13.012
He gives you your personality, because He
gives you maryadas.

00:25:13.012 --> 00:25:16.092
You see, by maryadas only, you get your personality.

00:25:16.092 --> 00:25:19.122
A person is known by his maryadas.

00:25:19.122 --> 00:25:23.582
And that’s what has to come within us, are
our maryadas.

00:25:23.582 --> 00:25:26.622
So today’s puja is about Shri Ganesha.

00:25:26.622 --> 00:25:32.032
As of course you know, He has got four petals
and you know what He is placed in and what

00:25:32.032 --> 00:25:37.162
He does and all that, and how He looks after
the chastity of His Mother and all that.

00:25:37.162 --> 00:25:44.042
But the main thing is that how we develop
Shri Ganesha within us, how people see us

00:25:44.042 --> 00:25:49.492
as the incarnations of innocence on this Earth.

00:25:49.492 --> 00:25:57.662
I know it’s very difficult, but imagine
Shri Ganesha sitting on the gate of hell,

00:25:57.662 --> 00:26:04.692
of excretion, because He’s just like a lotus,
above everything else, and He makes everything

00:26:04.692 --> 00:26:05.732
fragrant.

00:26:05.732 --> 00:26:12.662
In the same way I expect all of you, the Sahaja
yogis of Australia, to have that beautiful

00:26:12.662 --> 00:26:22.712
personality of Shri Ganesha, and that you
emit that fragrance of innocence among all

00:26:22.712 --> 00:26:25.682
the Sahaja yogis, and then among all the world.

00:26:25.682 --> 00:26:28.890
May God bless you.
