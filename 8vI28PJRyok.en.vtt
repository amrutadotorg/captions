00:00:01.691 --> 00:00:08.483
So welcome to you all, Sahaja Yogis,

00:00:08.775 --> 00:00:14.900
to this great country of yoga.

00:00:19.775 --> 00:00:28.191
Today first of all we have to establish

00:00:29.858 --> 00:00:35.441
our desire within ourselves

00:00:35.524 --> 00:00:38.191
that we are seekers

00:00:38.274 --> 00:00:45.441
and that we have to achieve our full growth and maturity.

00:00:47.191 --> 00:00:52.441
Today's puja is for the whole universe.

00:00:53.107 --> 00:00:58.024
The whole universe

00:00:58.191 --> 00:01:02.941
should be enlightened with your desires.

00:01:03.358 --> 00:01:07.274
Your desires should be so intense

00:01:07.358 --> 00:01:11.691
that they should emit out

00:01:11.775 --> 00:01:17.358
the pure vibrations of Mahakali Shakti,

00:01:17.441 --> 00:01:22.524
which is the pure desire

00:01:23.608 --> 00:01:26.941
of attaining the spirit.

00:01:27.107 --> 00:01:29.608
That's the real desire.

00:01:29.691 --> 00:01:36.940
All the other desires are like mirage.

00:01:40.358 --> 00:01:48.940
You are the people who are chosen by God.

00:01:51.024 --> 00:01:59.024
Specially, first to express your desire,

00:01:59.107 --> 00:02:02.941
and then to achieve it.

00:02:03.107 --> 00:02:14.691
And by intense desire of purity

00:02:14.775 --> 00:02:19.441
you have to purify the whole world.

00:02:19.608 --> 00:02:21.691
Not only the seekers,

00:02:21.775 --> 00:02:26.024
but even those who are not seekers.

00:02:30.441 --> 00:02:38.775
You have to create an aura around this universe,

00:02:38.858 --> 00:02:46.775
of desire to achieve the ultimate,

00:02:46.858 --> 00:02:50.274
the spirit.

00:02:56.024 --> 00:03:02.358
Without desire this universe would not have been created.

00:03:04.941 --> 00:03:14.441
This Desire of God is the one that is the Holy Ghost,

00:03:14.608 --> 00:03:18.608
is this all-pervading power,

00:03:18.691 --> 00:03:23.691
is the Kundalini within you.

00:03:24.274 --> 00:03:27.941
Kundalini has only one desire,

00:03:28.107 --> 00:03:31.524
is to be the spirit

00:03:31.691 --> 00:03:36.524
and anything else if you desire

00:03:36.691 --> 00:03:40.691
the Kundalini doesn't rise.

00:03:40.941 --> 00:03:44.191
Only when it knows

00:03:44.274 --> 00:03:50.858
that this desire is going to be fulfilled

00:03:53.191 --> 00:04:01.858
by somebody, who is facing the seeker,

00:04:02.941 --> 00:04:06.524
it is awakened.

00:04:07.441 --> 00:04:14.191
If you do not have the desire,

00:04:14.274 --> 00:04:17.191
no-one can force you.

00:04:17.274 --> 00:04:19.691
Sahaja Yogis should never try

00:04:19.858 --> 00:04:25.024
to force this desire on other people.

00:04:25.107 --> 00:04:27.691
The first ordeal we face,

00:04:27.775 --> 00:04:31.274
as soon as you get your Realization,

00:04:31.358 --> 00:04:36.941
is that you just start thinking of your family.

00:04:38.024 --> 00:04:41.608
You start thinking: 'My mother has not got it,

00:04:41.691 --> 00:04:44.940
my father has not got it,

00:04:44.941 --> 00:04:47.608
my wife has not got it,

00:04:47.775 --> 00:04:51.940
my children have not got it.'

00:04:54.358 --> 00:05:00.858
You must know that these relations are worldly.

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.107
Sanskrit is loukik.

00:05:03.191 --> 00:05:05.691
They are not aloukik,

00:05:05.775 --> 00:05:09.691
they are not beyond the worldly relationships.

00:05:09.858 --> 00:05:11.940
These are worldly relations,

00:05:12.024 --> 00:05:15.191
and these attachments are worldly.

00:05:15.274 --> 00:05:20.191
So if you play into that of course as you know,

00:05:20.274 --> 00:05:23.608
that Mahamaya Shakti allows you to play with that.

00:05:23.691 --> 00:05:26.858
You go ahead, as long as you like.

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.441
People bring Me all their relations,

00:05:30.524 --> 00:05:32.691
parents, this and that

00:05:32.775 --> 00:05:35.191
and ultimately they discover

00:05:35.358 --> 00:05:40.524
that this was a very wrong thing they did.

00:05:40.608 --> 00:05:47.524
They lost so many precious moments,

00:05:47.608 --> 00:05:50.191
so many hours, so many years,

00:05:50.274 --> 00:05:53.107
wasting their energy on people

00:05:53.274 --> 00:05:58.274
who never deserved any attention of Mother.

00:05:58.608 --> 00:06:04.775
Sooner you realize the better that this desire

00:06:05.107 --> 00:06:10.024
may be within you,

00:06:10.191 --> 00:06:15.775
and may not be in anyone of your so-called worldly relations.

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:20.691
Makes no difference.

00:06:21.107 --> 00:06:23.107
As Christ was told

00:06:23.191 --> 00:06:27.024
that His brothers and sisters are waiting outside,

00:06:27.107 --> 00:06:33.524
He said: 'Who are My brothers and who are My sisters?'

00:06:35.524 --> 00:06:39.608
So one has to realize that those people who involve themselves

00:06:39.691 --> 00:06:43.024
into the problems of their family all the time,

00:06:43.191 --> 00:06:46.107
and attract My attention,

00:06:46.274 --> 00:06:49.941
you must know that I am just playing about.

00:06:50.024 --> 00:06:54.024
It is of no value to you.

00:06:54.191 --> 00:06:57.691
For your ascent it is important first of all

00:06:57.775 --> 00:07:00.024
to have no desires

00:07:00.107 --> 00:07:05.191
to create desire in your kith and kin.

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:10.191
This is the first principle of establishment

00:07:10.358 --> 00:07:14.358
of Mahakali Power.

00:07:17.024 --> 00:07:20.107
Specially in India

00:07:20.191 --> 00:07:23.775
where people are too much attached to their family,

00:07:23.858 --> 00:07:27.608
it's a very big problem.

00:07:27.858 --> 00:07:31.024
If you give Realization to one person,

00:07:31.358 --> 00:07:35.775
you are amazed to see that all relationship they have

00:07:35.858 --> 00:07:39.358
is with a big bunch of bhoots.

00:07:40.191 --> 00:07:45.608
And once you give Realization to one person you are in for trouble.

00:07:45.775 --> 00:07:49.858
Then all the bhoots walk in, slowly,

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:53.524
torturing My life, wasting My energy,

00:07:53.608 --> 00:07:57.274
and absolutely disgusting.

00:07:57.858 --> 00:08:00.608
It should happen to you to understand

00:08:00.691 --> 00:08:03.775
that this is not auspicious.

00:08:03.858 --> 00:08:06.441
If you want to waste your time,

00:08:06.524 --> 00:08:10.358
I will allow you to waste your time.

00:08:10.608 --> 00:08:16.691
But if you want to have the ascent fast,

00:08:16.775 --> 00:08:18.940
first of all one must remember

00:08:19.024 --> 00:08:23.941
that these are relations which are absolutely worldly relations

00:08:24.024 --> 00:08:27.941
and this is not your pure desire.

00:08:28.441 --> 00:08:32.775
So try to separate your pure desire

00:08:32.858 --> 00:08:37.024
from your worldly desires.

00:08:37.858 --> 00:08:41.524
It does not by any means,

00:08:41.775 --> 00:08:46.358
suggest that you give up your family,

00:08:46.441 --> 00:08:50.940
you give up your mother or give up your sister - nothing.

00:08:50.941 --> 00:08:53.274
But you witness them

00:08:53.358 --> 00:08:59.441
and see, as you would see anybody else,

00:09:00.775 --> 00:09:04.940
and see for yourself, whether

00:09:05.024 --> 00:09:08.940
they are really desirous or not.

00:09:09.024 --> 00:09:10.691
If they are - well and good.

00:09:10.775 --> 00:09:14.358
They should not be disqualified because they are your relations.

00:09:14.441 --> 00:09:16.274
It works both ways.

00:09:16.358 --> 00:09:20.024
As they cannot be qualified because they are your relations,

00:09:20.107 --> 00:09:25.358
they cannot be disqualified because they're your relations.

00:09:25.441 --> 00:09:33.608
So in Sahaja Yoga to make your desire a pure desire,

00:09:34.191 --> 00:09:40.940
you have to get out of so many things.

00:09:41.024 --> 00:09:45.524
But for people who are attached to their family,

00:09:45.775 --> 00:09:49.274
are bound by their family,

00:09:49.524 --> 00:09:51.441
they have to see to it

00:09:51.608 --> 00:09:55.441
that they do not force Sahaja Yoga on anyone of their relations,

00:09:55.524 --> 00:09:59.524
at least don't force them on Me.

00:11:07.483 --> 00:11:13.650
Now this desire within us,

00:11:14.483 --> 00:11:18.149
which is the Mahakali Power which is manifesting,

00:11:18.232 --> 00:11:21.608
comes to us in so many ways.

00:11:21.733 --> 00:11:24.149
As I told you first of all,

00:11:24.232 --> 00:11:26.691
it comes to us after Realization,

00:11:26.816 --> 00:11:29.066
because you are all Sahaja Yogis,

00:11:29.191 --> 00:11:34.650
to do something about our relations.

00:11:34.858 --> 00:11:38.107
Then the second desire that comes to us,

00:11:38.358 --> 00:11:43.232
that let us try to cure people,

00:11:43.316 --> 00:11:47.858
who are our relations.

00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:50.316
This is the second desire,

00:11:50.441 --> 00:11:51.858
you should face yourself and see,

00:11:51.941 --> 00:11:55.066
that this has happened to many of you.

00:11:55.149 --> 00:12:00.691
So, right from leprosy

00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:06.066
to any small thing like cold or sneezing,

00:12:06.149 --> 00:12:08.399
whatever they have,

00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:14.358
you think you should bring to Mother.

00:12:16.149 --> 00:12:21.650
And all the worries of your families should be brought to Mother.

00:12:21.775 --> 00:12:26.191
Simple thing like pregnancy or sneezing,

00:12:26.399 --> 00:12:31.399
very simple things - which are so natural

00:12:31.691 --> 00:12:38.650
are brought into your attention.

00:12:39.816 --> 00:12:42.107
So when you have them in your attention I say:

00:12:42.232 --> 00:12:47.566
'All right, go ahead with it. Try to solve it, if possible.'

00:12:47.691 --> 00:12:50.316
But if you do not have them in your attention

00:12:50.441 --> 00:12:54.358
they are in My attention.

00:12:56.566 --> 00:13:01.274
You leave them in My attention, I'll manage that.

00:13:01.358 --> 00:13:05.399
But then it's a vicious circle.

00:13:06.066 --> 00:13:10.066
It's a very subtle projection of the mind

00:13:10.149 --> 00:13:11.941
that thinks: 'All right,

00:13:12.024 --> 00:13:14.149
that Mother we don't have this in our attention,

00:13:14.232 --> 00:13:19.982
You'd better look after it." That's not the way.

00:13:20.066 --> 00:13:24.982
You should have only one intense desire within yourself:

00:13:25.066 --> 00:13:28.775
"Have I become the spirit?

00:13:29.149 --> 00:13:32.982
Have I achieved my ultimate?

00:13:33.107 --> 00:13:37.940
Have I risen above the worldly desires?"

00:13:37.982 --> 00:13:40.982
Purify it.

00:13:43.274 --> 00:13:46.816
Once you start purifying whatever falls off,

00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:50.066
I'll look after that.

00:13:50.149 --> 00:13:56.066
This is just an assurance, but not a guarantee.

00:13:57.650 --> 00:14:04.566
If it deserves My attention I will definitely look after you.

00:14:05.441 --> 00:14:13.775
You have to value your attention as I value My attention.

00:14:16.441 --> 00:14:22.191
I think you have to value much more of your attention

00:14:23.232 --> 00:14:27.940
than Me, because I can manage,

00:14:28.107 --> 00:14:29.775
many more things within Myself,

00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:35.358
because everything is in My attention.

00:14:36.316 --> 00:14:41.316
But you try to purify your desires,

00:14:41.441 --> 00:14:46.441
away from the worldly problems that are facing you.

00:14:46.566 --> 00:14:50.441
So you expand it more, then you start thinking:

00:14:50.566 --> 00:14:57.733
'Mother, what about the problem of our country?'

00:15:01.149 --> 00:15:04.733
All right, give Me the map of your country - finished.

00:15:04.816 --> 00:15:08.399
That's more than sufficient.

00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:16.024
Then purify yourself.

00:15:16.149 --> 00:15:21.232
The desire that you have, you leave it.

00:15:21.358 --> 00:15:22.940
And once you are purified

00:15:23.024 --> 00:15:26.066
that area will be covered through your attention,

00:15:26.149 --> 00:15:30.066
it's very interesting.

00:15:30.149 --> 00:15:36.858
When you get over it then only you can throw light,

00:15:37.524 --> 00:15:40.149
but if you are inside you are hidden by that.

00:15:40.274 --> 00:15:43.816
Your light is hidden, there's no light emitted.

00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:46.691
You all rise above that desire.

00:15:46.816 --> 00:15:49.775
Every time you get a desire you rise above it,

00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:54.608
so your light is emitted on that wider problem

00:15:54.733 --> 00:15:56.483
that you are facing

00:15:56.608 --> 00:16:01.940
which you think should be solved by Me.

00:16:02.816 --> 00:16:07.900
These are all My headaches which you are taking on yourself.

00:16:07.941 --> 00:16:11.232
You have to do only one thing is to become the spirit

00:16:11.358 --> 00:16:13.900
that's all. Is a simple thing.

00:16:13.982 --> 00:16:18.441
The rest of it is My headache.

00:16:20.358 --> 00:16:26.816
Now the problems

00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:33.900
that should take your desire on the collective

00:16:33.982 --> 00:16:41.733
should be very different.

00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:47.608
To substantiate your purity,

00:16:47.858 --> 00:16:52.858
to be fragrant with your purity,

00:16:52.941 --> 00:16:56.232
your attention should be on the other side.

00:16:56.316 --> 00:16:58.024
Now you are not facing Me,

00:16:58.107 --> 00:17:00.274
you are sitting with Me facing the whole world.

00:17:00.358 --> 00:17:05.691
See, the whole attitude will change.

00:17:05.775 --> 00:17:11.066
The attitude should be: 'What can I give?

00:17:11.191 --> 00:17:14.524
How can I give?

00:17:14.650 --> 00:17:17.940
What is my mistake in giving?

00:17:18.024 --> 00:17:20.566
I have to be more alert.

00:17:20.650 --> 00:17:24.982
Where is my attention?

00:17:25.232 --> 00:17:27.483
I have to be more alert towards myself

00:17:27.566 --> 00:17:31.858
what am I doing?

00:17:32.358 --> 00:17:36.982
What's my responsibility?'

00:17:38.982 --> 00:17:44.941
You must desire that you should be pure.

00:17:45.024 --> 00:17:48.191
You should be pure desire.

00:17:48.316 --> 00:17:52.024
That means you should be the spirit.

00:17:52.149 --> 00:17:57.066
That, "What is your responsibility to yourself?"

00:17:57.191 --> 00:18:03.316
You should desire that your responsibility to yourself

00:18:03.441 --> 00:18:07.149
should be manifested,

00:18:07.274 --> 00:18:11.733
should be complete.

00:18:11.816 --> 00:18:17.524
Then your responsibility to this Sahaja Yoga.

00:18:17.608 --> 00:18:21.524
What is your responsibility to Sahaja Yoga,

00:18:21.608 --> 00:18:24.066
which is the work of God,

00:18:24.191 --> 00:18:30.608
which has started and you are My hands.

00:18:32.358 --> 00:18:36.483
You have to do the work of God,

00:18:36.608 --> 00:18:40.941
and you have to fight the anti-God elements,

00:18:41.066 --> 00:18:43.441
the satanic elements.

00:18:43.650 --> 00:18:46.066
You are not responsible for your family any more,

00:18:46.191 --> 00:18:49.816
those who are, are half-baked Sahaja Yogis

00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:53.608
I said, are useless absolutely good for nothing.

00:18:53.733 --> 00:18:56.441
All such will drop out, their families will suffer,

00:18:56.524 --> 00:18:59.107
I know this is going to happen.

00:18:59.232 --> 00:19:01.608
Because now the forces are gathering in such a way

00:19:01.733 --> 00:19:05.358
that sorting out will start.

00:19:05.483 --> 00:19:10.858
Your responsibility to yourself, to be the spirit,

00:19:10.941 --> 00:19:17.066
your responsibility to Sahaja Yoga,

00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:22.232
your responsibility to understand Me,

00:19:22.358 --> 00:19:26.900
better and better and better.

00:19:26.941 --> 00:19:29.982
Your responsibility to understand this mechanism

00:19:30.066 --> 00:19:33.066
that is within you,

00:19:33.191 --> 00:19:37.274
your responsibility to understand how this mechanism

00:19:37.399 --> 00:19:41.941
works out everything.

00:19:42.191 --> 00:19:47.940
The responsibility is to how to become a guru yourself.

00:19:48.858 --> 00:19:54.399
Your responsibility to be a dignified and a glorified personality.

00:19:54.524 --> 00:19:57.191
A responsibility to be a respectable person

00:19:57.316 --> 00:20:02.066
and not a cheap personality.

00:20:02.608 --> 00:20:05.191
Every one of you

00:20:05.274 --> 00:20:12.483
is worth the whole universe.

00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:18.691
If you want to rise to that height.

00:20:20.066 --> 00:20:26.358
Universes of universes can be thrown away at your feet.

00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:29.441
If you want to rise to that height,

00:20:29.524 --> 00:20:35.566
to that magnitude that is within you to prosper.

00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:40.149
But those people,

00:20:40.274 --> 00:20:50.191
who still want to live on a very low level cannot rise.

00:20:52.191 --> 00:20:54.566
For example,

00:20:54.650 --> 00:20:59.358
the western Sahaja Yogis have certain problems

00:21:01.274 --> 00:21:07.733
of committing the sin against the Mother,

00:21:07.858 --> 00:21:10.900
and the eastern Sahaja Yogis have the problem

00:21:10.982 --> 00:21:15.691
of committing sin against the Father.

00:21:16.775 --> 00:21:22.691
It's not difficult at all

00:21:24.066 --> 00:21:28.982
for you to get out of it.

00:21:35.733 --> 00:21:43.816
The attention is to be kept pure.

00:21:44.024 --> 00:21:48.858
In Sahaja Yoga you know all the methods

00:21:48.941 --> 00:21:54.232
how the attention one can keep it pure.

00:21:54.441 --> 00:21:56.483
If the attention is not pure

00:21:56.608 --> 00:21:59.691
then this desire

00:21:59.816 --> 00:22:04.483
will be always attacked

00:22:04.608 --> 00:22:07.524
by all petty nonsensical things

00:22:07.650 --> 00:22:11.608
which has no meaning in your ascent.

00:22:11.691 --> 00:22:14.650
Now a person who is a good Sahaja Yogi

00:22:14.775 --> 00:22:17.358
is not bothered about clothes, what others say to him

00:22:17.483 --> 00:22:19.608
or what others are talking to him,

00:22:19.691 --> 00:22:21.524
how they are behaving towards him and

00:22:21.650 --> 00:22:25.399
the attention is not on that

00:22:25.524 --> 00:22:30.566
criticism that this person is like this, that person is like that.

00:22:30.650 --> 00:22:36.441
Nor there is the aggressiveness

00:22:38.650 --> 00:22:42.608
of anyone else,

00:22:42.691 --> 00:22:45.650
because nobody is the other.

00:22:45.775 --> 00:22:50.524
But the problem is when I say that,

00:22:50.775 --> 00:22:56.566
no-one thinks that I'm saying about you, each persons.

00:22:56.691 --> 00:23:01.066
Those who are aggressive take the other role

00:23:01.191 --> 00:23:07.691
and those who are non-aggressive think the other way.

00:23:08.107 --> 00:23:12.024
Like I say something for a person who is aggressive,

00:23:12.107 --> 00:23:15.483
the non-aggressive immediately thinks of the person who is aggressive,

00:23:15.566 --> 00:23:19.066
not about himself.

00:23:19.149 --> 00:23:22.274
You immediately start shifting your mind to other person,

00:23:22.358 --> 00:23:26.940
finding faults with other people.

00:23:29.358 --> 00:23:33.232
So this desire becomes

00:23:33.358 --> 00:23:39.066
gradually lower and lower and lower

00:23:39.191 --> 00:23:44.232
because of the loads that are put onto it.

00:23:44.358 --> 00:23:47.733
So the alertness is very important,

00:23:47.858 --> 00:23:52.858
complete alertness - satarkata,

00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:57.982
that we should keep our attention

00:23:58.066 --> 00:24:05.900
purely for the sustenance of our pure desire.

00:24:07.608 --> 00:24:11.941
Desire comes from your heart

00:24:12.066 --> 00:24:13.816
and you are so built

00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:18.399
that your brahmarandra is also the heart.

00:24:18.524 --> 00:24:21.483
If you don't have a clean heart,

00:24:21.566 --> 00:24:25.941
this won't keep clean.

00:24:26.024 --> 00:24:28.733
There are people

00:24:28.858 --> 00:24:31.566
who think if they talk about Sahaja Yoga big,

00:24:31.650 --> 00:24:34.733
and all that, they are all right.

00:24:34.816 --> 00:24:38.274
They are cheating themselves.

00:24:38.524 --> 00:24:42.274
If the heart is not open

00:24:42.399 --> 00:24:45.940
then this is closed.

00:24:45.982 --> 00:24:52.232
So try to open your heart by projecting.

00:24:57.191 --> 00:25:01.358
Projecting it.

00:25:01.441 --> 00:25:05.483
I hope today when you do this puja

00:25:05.608 --> 00:25:09.650
and you do the worship of Mahakali

00:25:09.775 --> 00:25:14.691
and this special yagya,

00:25:14.816 --> 00:25:19.483
we will definitely establish this aura,

00:25:19.608 --> 00:25:24.358
and enlighten the universe.

00:25:24.441 --> 00:25:26.274
But your outlook should be:

00:25:26.399 --> 00:25:31.399
'How much I have contributed to this.

00:25:32.316 --> 00:25:35.650
Am I still thinking of other people,

00:25:35.775 --> 00:25:40.858
am I still thinking of my petty small problems,

00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:47.191
or I'm thinking of my spirit?'

00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:54.232
So, the left side

00:25:54.441 --> 00:26:01.566
starts and ends with Shri Ganesh.

00:26:01.650 --> 00:26:07.982
Shri Ganesh has only basic one quality,

00:26:08.066 --> 00:26:10.941
that He's completely surrendered to His Mother,

00:26:11.024 --> 00:26:14.733
He does not know any other God,

00:26:14.858 --> 00:26:18.483
He does not even know His Father.

00:26:19.024 --> 00:26:21.191
He only knows His Mother

00:26:21.316 --> 00:26:27.775
and completely surrendered to Her.

00:26:31.316 --> 00:26:37.441
But this pure desire has to have the action,

00:26:38.066 --> 00:26:40.149
and about which I'll tell you later

00:26:40.232 --> 00:26:44.816
as we will be having more pujas and more pujas.

00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:50.733
But today let us establish ourselves

00:26:51.775 --> 00:26:58.816
into that pure desire, to be the spirit.

00:26:59.191 --> 00:27:06.982
Now, as it is, with the western mind we'll say: 'How?'

00:27:09.358 --> 00:27:14.483
Is always coming, "How to do it?"

00:27:14.566 --> 00:27:21.232
Should I tell you? It's very simple.

00:27:21.358 --> 00:27:26.232
Adi Shankaracharya wrote 'Viveka Chudamani'

00:27:26.358 --> 00:27:30.816
and so many other books of treaties,

00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:37.441
and then all these big intellectuals got after his life.

00:27:37.524 --> 00:27:39.816
And they said:

00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:43.024
'How this and how that and how?'

00:27:43.107 --> 00:27:45.608
He said: 'Forget these people.'

00:27:45.733 --> 00:27:50.399
Then he wrote 'Saundarya Lahari',

00:27:50.483 --> 00:27:52.608
it's just a description of his Mother

00:27:52.816 --> 00:27:55.149
and his devotion to Her

00:27:55.232 --> 00:28:04.650
and every couplet that He wrote is a mantra.

00:28:05.274 --> 00:28:07.024
It is not the surrender

00:28:07.107 --> 00:28:13.024
of your mind through your mind,

00:28:13.149 --> 00:28:18.900
but the surrender of your heart.

00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:25.858
Is absolutely the surrender of your heart.

00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:29.900
Western Sahaja Yogis know very well

00:28:30.066 --> 00:28:33.441
how there have been attacks

00:28:33.524 --> 00:28:37.441
and attacks of negativity on them,

00:28:37.608 --> 00:28:44.107
specially when horrible people like Freud

00:28:44.650 --> 00:28:52.066
came to destroy their basic, the roots.

00:28:52.149 --> 00:28:57.441
And how the West accepted it blindfolded,

00:28:57.566 --> 00:29:02.608
and put them on the path of hell.

00:29:02.733 --> 00:29:06.441
All that has to be brought out.

00:29:06.566 --> 00:29:10.733
That is all nonsense, is wrong, absolutely

00:29:10.858 --> 00:29:15.691
against God, it's anti-God activity.

00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:19.232
Then you will realize

00:29:19.358 --> 00:29:27.733
that you will fight fully, by saying,

00:29:27.858 --> 00:29:34.524
"This is the destruction of our basics, our roots,

00:29:34.650 --> 00:29:36.066
when our Mother is the source

00:29:36.191 --> 00:29:40.941
of everything that is sublime, noble,

00:29:41.358 --> 00:29:44.316
all that is nourishing,

00:29:44.399 --> 00:29:49.941
all that is elevating, emancipating.

00:29:50.024 --> 00:29:53.566
You have cutting us from our roots.

00:29:53.650 --> 00:29:59.149
"When he dealt with, I think, animal-like creatures

00:29:59.232 --> 00:30:06.399
and he wants all of you to go down to that low level

00:30:06.524 --> 00:30:10.107
of human beings,

00:30:10.232 --> 00:30:18.274
which exist as pathological cases, I don't know.

00:30:18.399 --> 00:30:21.941
So it is important for you to understand all the attacks

00:30:22.066 --> 00:30:23.650
that came on you,

00:30:23.733 --> 00:30:25.232
and be alert

00:30:25.316 --> 00:30:30.940
and don't be identified with anyone of these.

00:30:30.982 --> 00:30:34.358
Last I would say you have come to this country

00:30:34.441 --> 00:30:38.900
to see the roots and not the shoot.

00:30:38.941 --> 00:30:42.316
Change your attitude of western style.

00:30:42.441 --> 00:30:44.816
Telephones are no good.

00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:47.316
You cannot get any telephones done here.

00:30:47.441 --> 00:30:50.566
Postage is horrible.

00:30:50.691 --> 00:30:52.691
Railways are worst.

00:30:52.816 --> 00:30:58.941
I shouldn't say because we are in a railway.

00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:11.066
But, the people are excellent.

00:31:11.191 --> 00:31:13.024
They know what is dharma.

00:31:13.149 --> 00:31:14.941
They are not being attacked, somehow or other

00:31:15.066 --> 00:31:16.940
because it being the Kundalini.

00:31:16.982 --> 00:31:22.608
The Ganesha is sitting here how dare anybody attack?

00:31:22.816 --> 00:31:27.066
This great Maharashtra has got eight Ganeshas,

00:31:27.191 --> 00:31:28.274
protecting them.

00:31:28.358 --> 00:31:32.358
I don't know if these Maharashtrians know this fact.

00:31:32.483 --> 00:31:34.816
And so many marutis,

00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:37.566
so who can attack this country?

00:31:37.691 --> 00:31:38.941
There is no negative attack

00:31:39.066 --> 00:31:44.358
except that they themselves are rather money-minded sort.

00:31:44.483 --> 00:31:47.524
That's the only curse they have, if they can get out of it

00:31:47.608 --> 00:31:51.441
they are great people.

00:31:54.483 --> 00:32:01.358
So, we have come to this country not to enjoy the comfort

00:32:01.441 --> 00:32:06.733
of the West, but the comfort of the spirit.

00:32:06.858 --> 00:32:12.274
So to change your attitude towards India

00:32:12.358 --> 00:32:17.691
I don't mean Air India, by any chance.

00:32:17.775 --> 00:32:20.566
This is a wrong idea that you come by Air India

00:32:20.650 --> 00:32:23.149
because you are a Sahaja Yogi. Not at all.

00:32:23.232 --> 00:32:26.232
Air India is nothing to do with Sahaja Yoga.

00:32:26.358 --> 00:32:28.733
All our railways, all our everything,

00:32:28.816 --> 00:32:30.775
they have nothing to do with Sahaja Yoga,

00:32:30.858 --> 00:32:33.191
so far.

00:32:35.650 --> 00:32:39.733
So you be patriotic and use your own airlines,

00:32:39.858 --> 00:32:43.316
for heaven's sake.

00:32:44.566 --> 00:32:47.066
But when you arrive here

00:32:47.149 --> 00:32:50.191
you will see that the people are too innocent,

00:32:50.316 --> 00:32:52.775
they can't understand Freud, you can't talk to them,

00:32:52.858 --> 00:32:55.483
it's beyond them.

00:32:55.608 --> 00:32:57.941
They are a higher type of people in this respect

00:32:58.066 --> 00:33:00.232
now because they are not attacked,

00:33:00.358 --> 00:33:03.024
while you are higher in a way that though you are attacked

00:33:03.107 --> 00:33:06.524
you've come out of it.

00:33:06.650 --> 00:33:10.066
You just turn your faces and you are on the other way.

00:33:10.191 --> 00:33:15.274
That's something great.

00:33:15.399 --> 00:33:18.024
So you would also have a confidence

00:33:18.149 --> 00:33:21.191
there are many people who believe the same way as you believe,

00:33:21.274 --> 00:33:26.733
in this big country where there's such a big population to support you.

00:33:26.858 --> 00:33:31.940
So you shouldn't feel lost.

00:33:33.024 --> 00:33:37.733
Thus today, we have to start this puja,

00:33:37.858 --> 00:33:41.650
on Mahakali Day.

00:33:41.733 --> 00:33:46.066
And it's the Day of the Gauri we can say,

00:33:46.191 --> 00:33:49.274
and Ganesh-Gauri's Day today,

00:33:49.399 --> 00:33:55.900
though according to the schedule time it may not be.

00:33:55.982 --> 00:33:57.816
But according to Me,

00:33:57.900 --> 00:34:02.399
let us establish within ourself on a subtler level

00:34:02.524 --> 00:34:08.274
the desire to be pure,

00:34:11.524 --> 00:34:15.650
and to be cleansed out.

00:34:15.733 --> 00:34:22.982
All the barriers and unclean things that are within us,

00:34:23.566 --> 00:34:28.232
to desire to be great Sahaja Yogis,

00:34:28.358 --> 00:34:34.941
desire to be responsible Sahaja Yogis

00:34:35.024 --> 00:34:39.940
and desire to be surrendered to your Mother.

00:34:40.191 --> 00:34:42.024
It's not difficult.

00:34:42.107 --> 00:34:45.149
That is the easiest, the last one is the easiest,

00:34:45.232 --> 00:34:47.232
because what you surrender,

00:34:47.358 --> 00:34:50.316
I don't want anything from you,

00:34:50.441 --> 00:34:55.483
except that you accept My Love.

00:34:55.608 --> 00:35:00.483
Surrendering just means you open your heart to accept My Love.

00:35:00.608 --> 00:35:03.441
Give up this ego.

00:35:03.566 --> 00:35:06.775
That's all and it will work out.

00:35:06.858 --> 00:35:11.066
I'm sure it's going to work out.

00:35:11.191 --> 00:35:14.566
I am trying to push Myself into your hearts

00:35:14.691 --> 00:35:18.608
and I'll definitely settle down there.

01:00:15.691 --> 01:00:20.733
Mahakali has a special capacity to weep,

01:00:20.941 --> 01:00:22.982
because She is left-sided.

01:00:23.066 --> 01:00:25.483
When She's helpless and She cannot act,

01:00:25.608 --> 01:00:28.358
She weeps.

01:00:28.483 --> 01:00:30.650
This is the only manifestation

01:00:30.775 --> 01:00:33.858
of Mahakali is that She desires,

01:00:33.941 --> 01:00:37.358
and if She doesn't get Her desire enacted

01:00:37.441 --> 01:00:38.858
then She just weeps,

01:00:38.941 --> 01:00:42.066
that's the only thing She can do in helplessness, isn't it.

01:00:42.232 --> 01:00:46.483
And sometimes when She's full of Love

01:00:46.566 --> 01:00:49.608
as I've seen you today all of you coming down here

01:00:49.691 --> 01:00:52.733
and all these people sitting down here.

01:00:52.858 --> 01:00:55.816
When She cannot express Herself fully,

01:00:55.940 --> 01:00:57.982
with full heart,

01:00:58.191 --> 01:01:08.316
also She feels that joy pouring as tears.

01:01:08.733 --> 01:01:10.608
May God bless you for today's puja,

01:01:10.691 --> 01:01:14.316
I hope all of you will take it in such a way

01:01:14.441 --> 01:01:16.941
that the subtlest of subtle

01:01:17.066 --> 01:01:19.608
will be awakened within you, the sensitivity

01:01:19.733 --> 01:01:23.733
every way, and the Love,

01:01:23.941 --> 01:01:27.024
which culminates into joy.

01:01:27.107 --> 01:01:33.441
Love that flowers into the fragrance of joy

01:01:33.566 --> 01:01:38.733
will manifest in today's puja.

01:01:38.816 --> 01:01:41.650
May God bless you!
