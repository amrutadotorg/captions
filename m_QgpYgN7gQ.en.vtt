00:00:02.333 --> 00:00:06.208
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:00:08.709 --> 00:00:13.166
The other day I told you a little bit about

00:00:13.417 --> 00:00:19.750
the first centre, called as Mooladhara chakra and Kundalini

00:00:19.999 --> 00:00:23.500
which is the resident consciousness in the triangular bone

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.208
called as sacrum.

00:00:27.458 --> 00:00:31.959
As I told you that this is the pure desire power

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:38.000
pure desire power which has not yet been awakened

00:00:38.291 --> 00:00:41.667
and is not yet manifested within you,

00:00:41.999 --> 00:00:47.166
which resides here, waiting for a moment to arise

00:00:47.417 --> 00:00:49.750
and to give you your second birth,

00:00:49.999 --> 00:00:53.625
your baptism it makes you at peace.

00:00:53.917 --> 00:00:58.458
It gives you your self-realization.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.458
This pure desire is to be one with your Spirit.

00:01:05.041 --> 00:01:09.125
This, unless and until it is fulfilled

00:01:09.375 --> 00:01:15.208
those who are seeking will never be satisfied whatever, they may do.

00:01:17.083 --> 00:01:23.166
Now, this centre is very important because this was the first centre

00:01:23.417 --> 00:01:25.500
that was created when

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.917
the Primordial Being started doing the job.

00:01:30.083 --> 00:01:34.542
This is the centre of innocence that is holiness.

00:01:34.834 --> 00:01:39.709
First thing that was created was the holiness on this Earth.

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:46.458
This centre is very important in all human beings,

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:49.500
because animals have innocence,

00:01:49.792 --> 00:01:52.834
they have not lost it while we have the right

00:01:53.041 --> 00:01:57.375
or we can say we have a freedom to abandon it.

00:01:57.667 --> 00:02:01.500
We can do it, we can somehow or other destroy it

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.375
by our so-called ideas of freedom.

00:02:06.417 --> 00:02:10.959
Now this centre has a power to give us wisdom.

00:02:11.125 --> 00:02:16.834
Now wisdom is such, such a word that cannot explained.

00:02:17.041 --> 00:02:22.709
Wisdom is the balance between your understanding

00:02:22.917 --> 00:02:26.208
of what is good and what is bad.

00:02:26.417 --> 00:02:29.834
Where you really understand what is good for you,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.417
for your spirit, is wisdom,

00:02:32.667 --> 00:02:37.083
and when this centre is alive and is not destroyed

00:02:37.333 --> 00:02:40.667
then you really know what this wisdom is.

00:02:40.917 --> 00:02:45.500
For example, the person who has got this centre

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:52.999
very well developed can tell you whether it is the north or the south,

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.709
because the magnetism that is in the Mother Earth

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:00.834
this centre is made by the element of Mother Earth.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.041
So the magnetism that is in the Mother Earth is

00:03:04.417 --> 00:03:06.750
there present in this centre.

00:03:06.999 --> 00:03:11.999
When the birds fly all the way from Siberia to Australia

00:03:12.208 --> 00:03:15.959
they do it with the help of this centre,

00:03:16.166 --> 00:03:19.834
because they know whether they are moving northward or southward.

00:03:20.041 --> 00:03:23.166
They have an innate wisdom to know which way to move

00:03:23.417 --> 00:03:25.250
and that's why one should know

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.959
that this centre is also within us

00:03:28.125 --> 00:03:30.834
but have lost our sense of judgement

00:03:31.041 --> 00:03:35.000
because we have lost that magnetism within us.

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:41.417
An innocent person is really like a magnet and it attracts, he attracts

00:03:41.667 --> 00:03:45.333
the people towards himself, just like a flower

00:03:45.583 --> 00:03:48.500
attracts a bee towards itself.

00:03:49.917 --> 00:03:54.959
There are some fishes in which they have found actual magnetic field

00:03:55.125 --> 00:03:59.125
and in some of them they have even found a regular magnet placed

00:03:59.375 --> 00:04:01.625
in certain fishes by which they know,

00:04:01.875 --> 00:04:05.250
wether they are going north, south, east or west.

00:04:05.917 --> 00:04:08.375
This centre in us

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:13.667
can be destroyed by various ways as I told you, last time.

00:04:13.917 --> 00:04:17.917
Now if you see on from the top there is a blue line coming down.

00:04:18.125 --> 00:04:22.458
This is the power of our desire by which we desire,

00:04:22.709 --> 00:04:25.875
is the emotional side of a human being.

00:04:26.458 --> 00:04:28.333
When a person

00:04:30.542 --> 00:04:32.917
neglects his emotional side

00:04:33.125 --> 00:04:36.583
or does not respect his emotional side,

00:04:36.875 --> 00:04:42.500
then this centre gets lost. It gets very much destroyed.

00:04:42.999 --> 00:04:47.083
The emotional side in these modern times

00:04:47.333 --> 00:04:50.291
is not well understood by human beings.

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:53.667
I'm sorry to say but it is very true

00:04:53.917 --> 00:04:56.083
that when you destroy this centre,

00:04:56.333 --> 00:05:00.375
first thing that sets in is impotency or over activity

00:05:00.625 --> 00:05:02.917
like the rapist and all that are created

00:05:03.125 --> 00:05:05.750
because this centre is neglected.

00:05:06.083 --> 00:05:08.875
Both things are just the same in the eyes of God,

00:05:09.041 --> 00:05:11.166
any extreme is wrong.

00:05:11.375 --> 00:05:15.417
Now, those people who say that you can be enlightened through sex

00:05:15.667 --> 00:05:18.208
are really, I don't know what to call them,

00:05:18.458 --> 00:05:20.750
because She is your Mother sitting down there

00:05:20.999 --> 00:05:22.417
She is only your Mother,

00:05:22.667 --> 00:05:25.709
She has no other child and She is holiest of holy.

00:05:25.959 --> 00:05:27.709
She is the holy Ghost within you

00:05:27.959 --> 00:05:30.542
and if you want to sex on your Mother, I mean

00:05:30.792 --> 00:05:32.500
I don't know if people understand that here.

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:36.375
In India it's impossible we cannot understand this nonsense.

00:05:36.834 --> 00:05:39.625
So is the same insult to your Mother.

00:05:39.834 --> 00:05:43.041
Like some people try to insult Mother Mary

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:47.208
by putting Christ in a very awkward situation with Her.

00:05:47.458 --> 00:05:49.250
It's something like that we can say

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.750
happens when you start talking like this.

00:05:53.333 --> 00:05:56.875
It's a very great sin to do such thing

00:05:57.041 --> 00:05:59.333
to your own Mother, which is the Kundalini

00:05:59.583 --> 00:06:01.250
and that's why the other day I told you,

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:03.542
I have seen some people have Kundalini

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:05.709
which is all the time tossing her head

00:06:05.959 --> 00:06:08.041
and breaking Her whole body

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:11.583
and just feeling so helpless because She's made

00:06:11.792 --> 00:06:15.959
so weak because the holiness from a person is vanished.

00:06:16.125 --> 00:06:20.999
Our idea of holiness has become so perverted, so perverted

00:06:21.208 --> 00:06:24.291
and to add up to that we have now gurus to tell us

00:06:24.542 --> 00:06:27.875
that it's a very good thing to do, you'll go to heaven.

00:06:28.041 --> 00:06:30.999
Actually they are very honest they say you'll go to bottomless pit

00:06:31.208 --> 00:06:34.999
and bottomless pit means hell.

00:06:35.333 --> 00:06:38.083
Why do you need a guru for this,

00:06:38.333 --> 00:06:40.458
actually you have mastered this art.

00:06:40.834 --> 00:06:45.250
I mean, in England when I went I was amazed that they have sex about,

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:47.125
I mean they talk of sex and sex and sex,

00:06:47.333 --> 00:06:49.083
morning till evening I don't understand.

00:06:49.333 --> 00:06:51.166
Like all important people talk, you see.

00:06:51.417 --> 00:06:53.000
That's how they go on talking about sex,

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:57.291
all the time, it's nothing but sex it's so filthy,

00:06:58.083 --> 00:06:59.125
so filthy.

00:06:59.375 --> 00:07:02.333
They talk sex with the animals, sex with the children, sex with...

00:07:02.583 --> 00:07:04.625
I don't know what's happening to human beings,

00:07:04.875 --> 00:07:07.834
how can be that filthy? I wouldn't be surprised

00:07:08.041 --> 00:07:09.750
after sometime we will have

00:07:09.999 --> 00:07:11.959
our bathrooms inside our drawing rooms,

00:07:12.166 --> 00:07:14.834
you see there's something like our privacy,

00:07:15.041 --> 00:07:18.125
something like our drawing room where we meet people.

00:07:18.375 --> 00:07:22.125
How can you talk of these things and how can you discuss

00:07:22.333 --> 00:07:25.083
these things which are so private, and so sacred,

00:07:25.333 --> 00:07:29.000
and that's how you lose them or you lose ballance over them.

00:07:30.166 --> 00:07:32.750
This is one of the things that's happening to us

00:07:32.959 --> 00:07:36.041
because God has given us freedom within,

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:37.625
we can do what we like.

00:07:37.834 --> 00:07:40.250
But we have lost our wisdom, we have lost.

00:07:40.458 --> 00:07:42.500
I don't why? If it is Industrial Revolution,

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:43.999
or I don't know whom to blame,

00:07:44.166 --> 00:07:46.166
but we have lost our wisdom to understand

00:07:46.375 --> 00:07:47.999
that these things are injurious.

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:50.417
If it is not we logically then, we can say,

00:07:50.667 --> 00:07:53.583
why do we develop diseases.

00:07:55.333 --> 00:07:58.792
With free sex, all the sailors you know under law

00:07:59.041 --> 00:08:00.999
have to have in every port

00:08:01.291 --> 00:08:04.041
arrangements for getting injections for all kinds

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:06.959
of complications that they have from sex life.

00:08:07.125 --> 00:08:10.166
Why is it you do not feel healthy every minute?

00:08:10.875 --> 00:08:14.083
You'll lose all your health, all your charm is gone from your face,

00:08:14.333 --> 00:08:17.333
You'll be sunken and look so horrid.

00:08:18.333 --> 00:08:20.458
Is a very good sign, just now to see

00:08:20.667 --> 00:08:22.583
how nature reacts with it.

00:08:22.834 --> 00:08:24.917
So one has to be wise to understand

00:08:25.125 --> 00:08:28.000
that God has given us this thing to us

00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:31.667
not to be insulted but for us to lead a good,

00:08:31.917 --> 00:08:34.750
normal, good married life,

00:08:35.041 --> 00:08:38.291
and not to waste our energies in this kind of thing.

00:08:38.542 --> 00:08:42.083
But when people start thinking about it

00:08:42.709 --> 00:08:44.542
then it's even worse.

00:08:44.792 --> 00:08:46.875
Then what happens, that this

00:08:47.125 --> 00:08:49.750
shifts from there the attention onto the other side

00:08:49.999 --> 00:08:53.542
and it goes to the yellow side, goes to the brain.

00:08:54.333 --> 00:08:57.291
When you start thinking about it, definite it is

00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:59.500
that you'll become impotent

00:08:59.709 --> 00:09:02.709
definite, no doubt at a very early stage.

00:09:02.917 --> 00:09:05.208
Because it is spontaneous.

00:09:05.834 --> 00:09:07.458
And when you start thinking about it,

00:09:07.667 --> 00:09:09.959
when your eyes starts roving here and there

00:09:10.166 --> 00:09:12.583
be sure your attention is gone to something

00:09:12.834 --> 00:09:15.208
which is so localised which is so different

00:09:15.458 --> 00:09:17.667
and which takes place only at a time

00:09:17.917 --> 00:09:22.834
when you are at a certain emotional spontaneity.

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:27.999
It's very out of date, to talk of these things to people

00:09:28.166 --> 00:09:30.041
but if you are not careful about it,

00:09:30.291 --> 00:09:33.999
you have to find out the statistics of American young people

00:09:34.166 --> 00:09:35.750
and you will be amazed

00:09:35.999 --> 00:09:39.125
how many of them are suffering from horrible diseases.

00:09:39.458 --> 00:09:42.625
When I went to America, I found that

00:09:43.125 --> 00:09:45.125
nine out of ten young people

00:09:45.333 --> 00:09:48.000
who came to me were suffering from these horrible diseases

00:09:48.291 --> 00:09:51.709
and most of them were impotent.

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:56.999
It's a shocking truth. One has to face as it is,

00:09:57.166 --> 00:10:00.041
and not to say, "Oh I'm alright, I'm alright",

00:10:00.291 --> 00:10:04.000
this is not the way to look at things, we have to see the statistics,

00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:05.834
that are being placed before us,

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.166
and to know that there is something wrong about it

00:10:09.417 --> 00:10:13.333
and with your wisdom you have reach certain conclusions about it.

00:10:14.083 --> 00:10:18.542
Now the second centre, which I call as a Swadisthana Center

00:10:18.834 --> 00:10:22.208
is also a very important centre within us.

00:10:22.417 --> 00:10:25.959
The first centre looks after all our excretion,

00:10:26.125 --> 00:10:28.625
it has got four petals in the same way

00:10:28.875 --> 00:10:31.250
in the pelvic plexus which is manifested by that,

00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:35.417
which is a gross plexus within us, has also got four sub-plexuses.

00:10:35.709 --> 00:10:39.999
Now the another one that we have is the Swadisthan Centre,

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:44.999
which is the second centre. Second centre has got six petals,

00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:48.750
and it supplies or it manifests in the gross,

00:10:48.999 --> 00:10:53.208
the Aortic Plexus, which also has got six sub-plexuses.

00:10:53.542 --> 00:10:57.000
Now this centre is very important for us

00:10:57.250 --> 00:10:59.750
in the modern times, it is extremely important

00:10:59.999 --> 00:11:04.583
and I think neglect of this centre can create lots of problems.

00:11:05.917 --> 00:11:09.583
Now this centre if you see is connected with the brain

00:11:09.959 --> 00:11:13.709
and this centre is responsible for our action,

00:11:13.959 --> 00:11:16.333
is the centre of our creativity.

00:11:16.583 --> 00:11:19.333
Where we think of the future,

00:11:19.583 --> 00:11:21.291
when we do any physical work,

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:23.999
we use this centre for that purpose

00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:27.542
and one has to understand that

00:11:27.792 --> 00:11:31.000
these days we are developing lots of diseases

00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:36.417
because we have not understood what is the function of this centre is.

00:11:37.083 --> 00:11:42.875
The foremost centre, foremost function of this centre is

00:11:43.083 --> 00:11:50.333
to convert the fat cells for the use of the grey matter in the head.

00:11:51.083 --> 00:11:53.792
When we think too much all the time about the future,

00:11:53.999 --> 00:11:56.834
we plan, we go on planning into all details,

00:11:57.041 --> 00:11:59.834
what happens is that this poor centre

00:12:00.041 --> 00:12:04.375
has to work very hard to produce new cells one after another

00:12:04.583 --> 00:12:07.250
for the use of your brain.

00:12:07.542 --> 00:12:10.375
Apart from that it has to do many other functions.

00:12:10.583 --> 00:12:14.166
It has to look after you liver, it has to look after you spleen,

00:12:14.417 --> 00:12:16.417
it has to look after you pancreas,

00:12:16.625 --> 00:12:20.625
your kidneys and also uterus among women.

00:12:21.583 --> 00:12:24.583
If you start thinking too much

00:12:25.083 --> 00:12:28.166
all the time thinking, if you cannot stop your thinking,

00:12:28.417 --> 00:12:31.250
all the time your brain goes on thinking, a sort of a

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:34.125
thinking process starts without your control,

00:12:34.375 --> 00:12:37.125
then this poor centre has to work all that,

00:12:37.375 --> 00:12:39.750
your liver goes out.

00:12:40.166 --> 00:12:41.375
When your liver goes out,

00:12:41.625 --> 00:12:44.792
you must know that liver is one of the most important

00:12:45.041 --> 00:12:50.500
things within us because it nourishes our attention, Chitta.

00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:52.917
It nourishes our Chitta,

00:12:53.083 --> 00:12:59.125
now this attention whenever it is spoiled

00:12:59.375 --> 00:13:01.917
it is spoiled because there are certain poisons within us.

00:13:02.125 --> 00:13:05.250
Any, it can be physical poisons it can be mental poisons,

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:08.375
it can be emotional poisons, any kind of poisons there are,

00:13:08.625 --> 00:13:11.458
especially the physical and the emotional ones,

00:13:11.667 --> 00:13:14.750
they go to this liver, which sorts it out.

00:13:14.999 --> 00:13:18.875
This is the function of this liver is to sort it out.

00:13:19.125 --> 00:13:22.291
But when you are not giving it sufficient energy

00:13:22.542 --> 00:13:25.999
you are losing through thinking then poor this centre

00:13:26.208 --> 00:13:28.542
is left behind, it has no nourishment

00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:32.625
nobody looks after it, it becomes sluggish. When it becomes sluggish

00:13:32.875 --> 00:13:36.834
all the heat accumulates in the liver,

00:13:37.792 --> 00:13:40.000
and such a person doesn't get any temperature

00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:42.999
till he gets cirrhosis and he dies.

00:13:43.333 --> 00:13:46.959
Now when thinking goes on too much, people get tired of thinking,

00:13:47.166 --> 00:13:48.999
thinking too much, thinking too much.

00:13:49.208 --> 00:13:53.542
So they think: "Let's have something that will take us

00:13:53.792 --> 00:13:56.999
away from thinking, which will give us a kick outside".

00:13:57.208 --> 00:14:00.375
So they take some sort of a drug , or a drink,

00:14:00.625 --> 00:14:03.083
or alcohol and all that.

00:14:03.333 --> 00:14:05.458
All the saints in the world have said

00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:08.000
that alcohol is very dangerous for life.

00:14:08.291 --> 00:14:12.458
The reason is that it goes against our awareness,

00:14:12.917 --> 00:14:16.208
this is a fact, you know that after taking a drink

00:14:16.417 --> 00:14:20.333
our awareness becomes blurred or excited, it's not normal,

00:14:20.792 --> 00:14:22.291
that's the reason they said no.

00:14:22.542 --> 00:14:25.709
In Sahaja Yoga I do not say don't do this and don't do that.

00:14:25.959 --> 00:14:28.959
I only want you to come to Sahaja Yoga, get your Realisation

00:14:29.166 --> 00:14:32.959
and then you'll not ask for it. That's a much better way to do it.

00:14:33.166 --> 00:14:36.792
But why they asked you, for example, if you read Moses,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.667
Moses has clearly said that these are strong

00:14:43.125 --> 00:14:46.834
drinks, very clearly, I don't know if people read that,

00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:50.458
and they should be avoided. I don't if the Jews do that.

00:14:51.250 --> 00:14:53.999
They should not be taken, he has very clearly said it.

00:14:54.250 --> 00:14:58.875
Abraham said the same thing that drinks are not good.

00:14:59.083 --> 00:15:01.500
Why all these prophets talk about it?

00:15:01.709 --> 00:15:05.375
Because they are all born in that green patch of ours,

00:15:05.834 --> 00:15:07.625
they are all placed in this green patch

00:15:07.875 --> 00:15:11.208
where we get our sustenance, which is ten.

00:15:12.208 --> 00:15:14.583
We have got ten sustenances within us,

00:15:14.834 --> 00:15:16.917
like the gold has a sustenance

00:15:17.125 --> 00:15:19.917
that it does not tarnish

00:15:20.125 --> 00:15:23.208
in the same way human beings have got ten sustenances.

00:15:23.458 --> 00:15:28.792
And these ten sustenances are represented by great prophets.

00:15:29.208 --> 00:15:32.792
The principle is called as Adi Guru, in Sanskrit language,

00:15:32.999 --> 00:15:34.417
the Primordial Master.

00:15:34.667 --> 00:15:36.999
He has incarnated on this earth

00:15:37.208 --> 00:15:41.458
as Abraham, Moses, as Lao Tse,

00:15:41.709 --> 00:15:44.792
as Confucius, as Socrates,

00:15:45.041 --> 00:15:50.250
recently he has been as Sai Nath of Shirdi, not the other fellow,

00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:56.375
and other great people have been like Nanaka, Janaka.

00:15:56.625 --> 00:16:00.125
All these great saints came on this earth to tell us

00:16:00.375 --> 00:16:04.583
how to keep in the centre, how to keep our sustenance,

00:16:04.792 --> 00:16:06.208
how to be human beings.

00:16:06.458 --> 00:16:10.917
As carbon has got four valances, we too have got ten valances.

00:16:11.125 --> 00:16:14.083
We have to maintain those ten valances within us,

00:16:14.375 --> 00:16:15.875
that's what they came to tell us.

00:16:16.083 --> 00:16:19.625
But you see if anybody says now don't drink,

00:16:19.875 --> 00:16:22.166
half of the hall will be empty.

00:16:22.458 --> 00:16:25.500
If you say you cannot have free sex, five people will walk out.

00:16:25.792 --> 00:16:26.999
That's the problem,

00:16:27.208 --> 00:16:30.917
here nobody likes to know anything about it,

00:16:31.125 --> 00:16:33.166
but it's a dangerous thing to do.

00:16:33.417 --> 00:16:36.208
Whatever it is that you have to keep in the centre.

00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:39.625
You have to be in the centre, and how to keep in the centre

00:16:39.875 --> 00:16:42.500
is not to go to extremes, be moderate,

00:16:42.750 --> 00:16:44.500
and moderate life is the best way.

00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:46.709
But even if you have not been, doesn't matter.

00:16:46.959 --> 00:16:49.250
Kundalini is at this point in such a force

00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:50.917
that whatever you might have done,

00:16:51.125 --> 00:16:52.750
you get your realization quite alright.

00:16:52.999 --> 00:16:55.125
So is a different point, but what I am trying to tell you

00:16:55.375 --> 00:16:57.917
is this that why these people said so.

00:16:58.083 --> 00:16:59.000
Why they said?

00:16:59.250 --> 00:17:01.917
Now Mohammed Sahib is another who said don't drink,

00:17:02.166 --> 00:17:04.999
he's one of them, he's just the same, there's no difference,

00:17:05.291 --> 00:17:07.917
there's no difference between Moses and Mohammed Sahib,

00:17:08.083 --> 00:17:11.500
I can prove it to you on vibrations, you can yourself know

00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:14.125
through vibrations that they were the same people,

00:17:14.375 --> 00:17:16.750
said the same thing, there's no difference of any kind.

00:17:16.999 --> 00:17:18.792
It's only people are fighting, I don't know why,

00:17:18.999 --> 00:17:22.125
I just can't understand what is there to fight between these two.

00:17:22.375 --> 00:17:24.917
They were just the same, preached the same thing,

00:17:25.166 --> 00:17:32.125
and when Moses crossed the river and the bridge was made

00:17:32.375 --> 00:17:36.583
that bridge is the bridge which is symbolic of the Kundalini

00:17:36.792 --> 00:17:40.500
that creates for you, to cross this void within us.

00:17:40.875 --> 00:17:44.750
Is very symbolic, they have worked so hard

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.709
to tell you what is sustenance,

00:17:47.959 --> 00:17:49.542
where we have to be in the centre

00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:52.041
because if you are in sustenance as he said,

00:17:52.250 --> 00:17:56.291
that only a thread of this Kundalini rises.

00:17:56.583 --> 00:17:59.667
It is not one thread that should rise, actually I've seen in people

00:17:59.917 --> 00:18:02.041
the whole of it goes up like that and it stays there

00:18:02.291 --> 00:18:04.208
in many people but the trouble is

00:18:04.458 --> 00:18:06.999
it rises because there's no space to rise.

00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:09.208
We are finished off with the Swadisthana

00:18:09.458 --> 00:18:11.999
and with another chakra which is in the centre,

00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:16.375
which is the... allright

00:18:16.999 --> 00:18:20.375
In the centre that is the

00:18:21.417 --> 00:18:25.083
called as Nabhi Chakra means the navel centre.

00:18:25.333 --> 00:18:29.542
So when you have an obstruction in the centre,

00:18:29.792 --> 00:18:32.750
naturally the Kundalini, though it rises with full force

00:18:32.959 --> 00:18:34.625
all the things, all the threads fall down

00:18:34.834 --> 00:18:36.875
and only one somehow or other goes up

00:18:37.083 --> 00:18:38.959
and opens up the Sahastrara,

00:18:39.166 --> 00:18:41.875
thinking that at least if I open up there, then

00:18:42.041 --> 00:18:43.999
the others, the grace will fall and maybe it will open out more.

00:18:44.208 --> 00:18:46.917
and maybe it will open out more.

00:18:47.125 --> 00:18:49.709
So this is the problem, that's why they said

00:18:49.917 --> 00:18:53.875
that you lead a life which is moderate and temperate

00:18:54.083 --> 00:18:55.667
and this is what they preached too.

00:18:55.917 --> 00:18:59.500
Now let us see what happens when we go to extremes.

00:18:59.959 --> 00:19:01.583
In the centre as we have seen

00:19:01.792 --> 00:19:03.834
is the sustenance within us.

00:19:03.999 --> 00:19:05.875
Now if you try to go beyond this

00:19:06.083 --> 00:19:08.583
side or that side, what happens, let us see.

00:19:08.792 --> 00:19:11.250
Beyond this side is the subconscious,

00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:15.125
if you go, you enter into the collective subconscious.

00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:18.291
On the other side if you move, that is

00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:23.709
the supra-conscious, you enter into collective supra-conscious.

00:19:24.083 --> 00:19:28.999
Now into this side are all the people on the left-side

00:19:29.208 --> 00:19:33.041
are the people who are still dissatisfied, very sly,

00:19:33.291 --> 00:19:36.250
sinister, horrible people who are dead,

00:19:36.458 --> 00:19:38.125
who do not want to take birth

00:19:38.333 --> 00:19:42.166
and who still want to torture people, are still existing there.

00:19:42.375 --> 00:19:45.709
These are busy bodies, they can possess you,

00:19:45.959 --> 00:19:49.667
they do possess and on the right hand side there are people

00:19:49.917 --> 00:19:51.875
like Hitler who are very ambitious,

00:19:52.083 --> 00:19:54.875
who have died out of their ambitions and things like that,

00:19:55.083 --> 00:19:56.542
they still exist there.

00:19:56.792 --> 00:19:58.458
Either you enter into this side

00:19:58.709 --> 00:20:00.375
or either you enter into that side

00:20:00.583 --> 00:20:03.625
when you go to extremes and you just get possessed.

00:20:03.875 --> 00:20:07.750
It's a very dangerous area you are entering into.

00:20:07.959 --> 00:20:12.000
Recently I was seeing a BBC program

00:20:12.250 --> 00:20:15.583
and some doctors had disco- vered a very interesting thing,

00:20:15.834 --> 00:20:22.500
they said that cancer is triggered, listen to this very carefully,

00:20:22.709 --> 00:20:26.166
cancer is triggered by some proteins, they call it

00:20:26.375 --> 00:20:29.959
protein 58, protein 56 or something like that.

00:20:30.375 --> 00:20:33.542
When these proteins attack

00:20:33.875 --> 00:20:37.417
us from some unknown areas within us

00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:40.792
which are built within us since our creation.

00:20:40.999 --> 00:20:43.792
What are these areas? I mean this I've been telling for so many years,

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.250
is the left side and the right side, the two extremes.

00:20:49.083 --> 00:20:51.709
Now what do we do when we go to the right side,

00:20:52.417 --> 00:20:56.041
the right side is the area where you think too much

00:20:56.375 --> 00:20:58.792
where you project yourself in the future.

00:20:59.041 --> 00:21:03.458
Now like that you go on, then you start becoming a person

00:21:03.709 --> 00:21:07.917
who is more interested in the future than in the present.

00:21:08.083 --> 00:21:10.458
The centre is the present.

00:21:10.709 --> 00:21:14.417
Now you start projecting your mind into that

00:21:14.667 --> 00:21:17.083
when you start projecting your mind too much into that,

00:21:17.333 --> 00:21:20.166
you start moving into that side, with that,

00:21:20.458 --> 00:21:22.250
anybody who is an austere person,

00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:24.417
they think that if you are a very austere person,

00:21:24.667 --> 00:21:26.709
you lead the life of celibacy and

00:21:26.959 --> 00:21:31.999
all this nonsensical things you see, all this is absolutely nonsensical.

00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:34.250
If you lead a life of celibacy

00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:35.792
it's not going to help you

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.625
at all, on the contrary such a person becomes an

00:21:37.875 --> 00:21:40.542
extremely dry personality

00:21:40.875 --> 00:21:43.667
and ultimately dies of heart attack

00:21:43.917 --> 00:21:47.333
and such a person is so hard headed,

00:21:48.291 --> 00:21:51.750
so hot tempered that you must take a barge pole

00:21:51.999 --> 00:21:54.750
before you meet such a person.

00:21:55.500 --> 00:22:01.417
There are so cursing type. I mean so

00:22:01.917 --> 00:22:07.083
unaware of other people's health or anything

00:22:07.333 --> 00:22:08.875
that they can curse anyone

00:22:09.083 --> 00:22:11.500
and this is their job is to curse this one and

00:22:11.709 --> 00:22:14.333
curse that one and curse that one.

00:22:15.166 --> 00:22:17.000
They are extremely dry people,

00:22:17.250 --> 00:22:20.208
they might take to social work in the name of God

00:22:20.417 --> 00:22:23.583
or they'll work like hell for the poor

00:22:23.792 --> 00:22:27.083
they're thinking they're saving the poor and doing this and that

00:22:27.333 --> 00:22:30.542
and while if you see them any other time,

00:22:30.834 --> 00:22:36.000
you'll be sure that such a person is absolutely burning with fire.

00:22:36.333 --> 00:22:38.709
They have a horrible liver,

00:22:38.999 --> 00:22:42.375
very hot temper, there is no sweetness about them,

00:22:42.667 --> 00:22:45.208
there is no magnetism about them,

00:22:45.458 --> 00:22:48.999
all the people run away from them, they are like boiled sprouts,

00:22:49.166 --> 00:22:50.458
you see, sitting on everybody's head.

00:22:50.667 --> 00:22:53.583
Do this, do that, you haven't done this, what are you doing,

00:22:53.834 --> 00:22:57.250
they will not sleep themselves and not allow anybody to sleep,

00:22:59.041 --> 00:23:02.291
they think that everybody is supposed to work under their thumb

00:23:02.542 --> 00:23:05.667
and these are the people who are very ego oriented as shown there

00:23:05.917 --> 00:23:09.000
are the people who move onto the right hand side.

00:23:09.250 --> 00:23:11.999
Any austere ideas about religion

00:23:12.208 --> 00:23:14.250
can take you to this side

00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:18.709
and this austerity is very dangerous for human beings

00:23:18.959 --> 00:23:21.959
because it cuts you off from the whole.

00:23:22.625 --> 00:23:24.999
Such a person may be entrapped

00:23:25.250 --> 00:23:30.500
or possessed by some sort of a personality on the right hand side.

00:23:30.792 --> 00:23:33.792
I know of a lady who is very well known in India

00:23:33.999 --> 00:23:37.500
and whose got a big prize and this and that for her social work.

00:23:37.792 --> 00:23:39.583
I happened to see her first time

00:23:39.875 --> 00:23:41.667
on an aero plane when she had no

00:23:41.917 --> 00:23:45.333
prizes and all that, she came with some sort of an odd stuff with her

00:23:45.583 --> 00:23:47.542
and she wanted to sit in the front seat.

00:23:47.834 --> 00:23:50.250
So air hostess said: "I'm sorry this is

00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:52.417
this is reserved for some children who are sick

00:23:52.709 --> 00:23:55.208
and they have to go by this plane and we can't give you this",

00:23:55.458 --> 00:23:57.667
and the mother is there. She started fighting the mother,

00:23:57.917 --> 00:23:59.166
how many sick are cured

00:23:59.375 --> 00:24:00.917
what do you think of yourself and this and that

00:24:01.166 --> 00:24:04.250
and she was just jumping from here to there and there to there

00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:06.458
and she wouldn't allow the plane to leave

00:24:06.709 --> 00:24:08.583
and for half an hour she was fighting

00:24:08.875 --> 00:24:11.250
to sit down there and the amount of

00:24:11.542 --> 00:24:15.041
abuses she used for the air hostess I was amazed.

00:24:15.291 --> 00:24:18.166
And she's supposed to be a woman who should be given a peace

00:24:18.417 --> 00:24:21.250
prize or something like that, I don't know, there was no peace

00:24:21.458 --> 00:24:23.583
on her face neither around her

00:24:23.875 --> 00:24:27.500
and everybody was so disturbed with the way she was on about it,

00:24:27.750 --> 00:24:29.250
it was really shocking

00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:32.250
to see this personality who was so hot tempered

00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:34.458
and so meticulous about things

00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:36.208
and she was arguing with her

00:24:36.458 --> 00:24:39.792
this was my seat and this was this and this was that.

00:24:39.999 --> 00:24:43.375
Thank God then they got her out and the plane left the place,

00:24:43.625 --> 00:24:47.041
but I'm telling you such people can be so

00:24:47.291 --> 00:24:50.250
frantically hot tempered and can be so

00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:52.667
unaware of your presence there

00:24:52.917 --> 00:24:55.333
that you have to be very, very careful with them.

00:24:55.625 --> 00:24:59.291
Such people may look to be very, very successful in life you see

00:24:59.583 --> 00:25:01.999
and when they walk they have an upper lip

00:25:02.250 --> 00:25:04.000
and all sorts of things you see

00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:06.917
but it takes no time for them to realise

00:25:07.083 --> 00:25:09.583
that it's all tom-foolery going on.

00:25:09.834 --> 00:25:14.875
This kind of ego orientation can lead you to nothing but stupidity.

00:25:15.083 --> 00:25:17.417
A person can be extremely stupid

00:25:17.667 --> 00:25:20.041
and he doesn't know he has been, how stupid he has been,

00:25:20.250 --> 00:25:22.125
because this is: "What's wrong?"

00:25:22.375 --> 00:25:25.166
You see a gentleman came to see us and he had a wife,

00:25:25.417 --> 00:25:26.750
she was a mere sixteen years of age

00:25:26.999 --> 00:25:29.500
and the fellow was eighty years of age, you see.

00:25:29.792 --> 00:25:32.542
Naturally I thought he must be the grandfather you see

00:25:32.834 --> 00:25:36.208
so I said: "Is she your granddaughter?"

00:25:36.417 --> 00:25:38.750
So my husband pinched Me said: "That's his wife."

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.125
I said: "Really?" I said: "I'm sorry, I didn't know she was a...

00:25:41.375 --> 00:25:44.542
"What's wrong I can have a wife who is two year old,

00:25:44.834 --> 00:25:46.542
what's wrong in it?" I said: "Nothing wrong,

00:25:46.792 --> 00:25:49.500
only thing is people will laugh at you, that's all".

00:25:49.959 --> 00:25:53.041
All sorts of stupid things people do in this world,

00:25:53.333 --> 00:25:56.208
and they think "what's wrong?" This is the best way

00:25:56.417 --> 00:25:59.083
to get along with your stupidity, till they discover

00:25:59.333 --> 00:26:02.333
that you are the greatest stupid person doing wrong.

00:26:02.709 --> 00:26:05.709
Now this stupidity comes from this ego,

00:26:05.959 --> 00:26:09.208
coming up and surrounding your brain completely,

00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:11.625
you cannot see anything else, you just see yourself,

00:26:11.875 --> 00:26:15.500
my room, my house, my, my, my, my, my.

00:26:15.792 --> 00:26:17.750
You cannot see that there are others,

00:26:17.999 --> 00:26:21.291
that you owe some sort of relationship to others,

00:26:21.583 --> 00:26:23.166
that you have to be kind to them,

00:26:23.375 --> 00:26:25.166
that you have to share things with them,

00:26:25.375 --> 00:26:28.792
you all the time think of yourself and such people get possessed

00:26:28.999 --> 00:26:31.999
by the supra-conscious style.

00:26:32.250 --> 00:26:34.999
What happens in spirituality in such people,

00:26:35.625 --> 00:26:38.250
they start feeling their body is lying here

00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:40.375
and they go up and sit on a tree,

00:26:40.583 --> 00:26:43.583
they think it is realisation or enlightenment, just imagine.

00:26:43.834 --> 00:26:47.000
This is nothing but a supra-conscious spirit

00:26:47.250 --> 00:26:51.959
has entered and taken the body away and put it there.

00:26:52.291 --> 00:26:56.375
I had, I told you three Americans coming from

00:26:56.625 --> 00:27:00.834
America and they were known to be very big scientists.

00:27:01.041 --> 00:27:03.625
They came to see Me and said:

00:27:03.875 --> 00:27:05.999
"Mother you have to teach us one thing." I said: "What?"

00:27:06.208 --> 00:27:08.083
"We want to fly." I said: "Fly?

00:27:08.333 --> 00:27:10.208
You're already flying, what do you want to flying?"

00:27:10.458 --> 00:27:12.917
They said: "No, but we want to fly with ESP",

00:27:13.208 --> 00:27:14.500
I said: "You should not do that

00:27:14.709 --> 00:27:16.917
because if you do that then you are enslaved

00:27:17.125 --> 00:27:19.375
by these spirits and you do want to do that,

00:27:19.625 --> 00:27:20.875
to be enslaved by these spirits?"

00:27:21.041 --> 00:27:23.583
"Yes, whatever it is, enslavement or anything,

00:27:23.834 --> 00:27:26.166
we want to have this and we want to get this

00:27:26.417 --> 00:27:28.083
by which we will fly." I said: "Why?"

00:27:28.333 --> 00:27:31.208
They said: "Because Russia is doing it, and Russians

00:27:31.458 --> 00:27:33.792
are doing experiments with ESP.

00:27:33.999 --> 00:27:36.083
So we should also do it." I said: "If they are going to hell,

00:27:36.333 --> 00:27:39.250
are you also going to hell?" They said: "Yes, what's wrong?"

00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:40.375
I said: "Nothing is wrong,

00:27:40.583 --> 00:27:43.041
go with two running jumps, you can go very fast there,

00:27:43.291 --> 00:27:45.709
but as far as I am concerned I am not for it,

00:27:45.999 --> 00:27:48.041
I am not going to doom your life forever."

00:27:48.333 --> 00:27:52.583
So I asked them:

00:27:52.875 --> 00:27:54.458
"Who has sent you to me?"

00:27:54.667 --> 00:27:55.959
And they said: "One Patanjali."

00:27:56.208 --> 00:27:57.959
You see there is a fellow called Patanjali

00:27:58.166 --> 00:28:01.291
who is a journalist, I said: "This Patanjali has sent you?"

00:28:01.542 --> 00:28:03.959
"Yes, he has sent us to you."

00:28:04.125 --> 00:28:06.625
He was the man who used to leave his body,

00:28:06.834 --> 00:28:09.208
and run all over the places. He was a journalist

00:28:09.458 --> 00:28:13.834
you see, so he used to get the news before anybody knew

00:28:15.041 --> 00:28:18.750
and he used to run out of his house and the wife was so surprised

00:28:18.999 --> 00:28:20.583
that one day he brought some sand

00:28:20.834 --> 00:28:22.583
and he said: "Yesterday do you know where I was,

00:28:22.834 --> 00:28:25.792
I was on the beach, from there I brought the sand for you."

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.625
She got such a fright, and he used to shake before

00:28:28.875 --> 00:28:31.750
any photograph of God or Christ or anyone,

00:28:31.999 --> 00:28:34.250
he used to shake like that, so she brought to Me

00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:35.667
she said:, "This fellow is shaking

00:28:35.875 --> 00:28:37.500
I don't know what is happening, he is rattling,

00:28:37.709 --> 00:28:38.834
this Parkinson's thing.

00:28:39.041 --> 00:28:41.917
I don't know what is happening, and in the night he disappears,

00:28:42.125 --> 00:28:44.125
I lock up everything and still he disappears,

00:28:44.375 --> 00:28:47.041
I don't know what to do, it's very shocking.

00:28:47.250 --> 00:28:51.166
He said: "Sometimes I go and sit on a tree." I said:  "Really?"

00:28:51.792 --> 00:28:54.417
So I told him that: "You are possessed."

00:28:54.709 --> 00:28:55.959
He said: "Mother, please take it away.

00:28:56.125 --> 00:28:58.500
I don't want this nonsense, you don't know where I will land up.

00:28:58.792 --> 00:29:00.625
Tomorrow I could be anywhere, hanging in the air,

00:29:00.875 --> 00:29:04.709
I don't want to do that anymore, maybe my body won't come back."

00:29:04.999 --> 00:29:09.500
This is what people are doing now, they take out the spirits.

00:29:09.959 --> 00:29:13.709
When they take out the spirit from a person, you see,

00:29:13.999 --> 00:29:16.999
they keep it with them. Like the children,

00:29:17.208 --> 00:29:19.750
small children die in their sleep.

00:29:19.999 --> 00:29:23.333
If a mother is here and she has a child in America,

00:29:23.583 --> 00:29:25.999
and she say's I want to talk to my child through a medium,

00:29:26.250 --> 00:29:29.875
is a very dangerous thing, never play with medium, very dangerous.

00:29:30.083 --> 00:29:32.166
And such a mother I know in Switzerland,

00:29:32.417 --> 00:29:35.875
she did that to a child and the child died in America,

00:29:36.083 --> 00:29:38.917
in the sleep. Because the distance is such,

00:29:39.125 --> 00:29:42.709
that where there isday, there is ¨ night, and she was doing this

00:29:42.959 --> 00:29:45.291
in the daytime and the child was sleeping.

00:29:45.542 --> 00:29:47.792
She talked to the child, she heard his voice,

00:29:47.999 --> 00:29:49.959
everything she did and the child died.

00:29:50.166 --> 00:29:53.792
"Never go near these people who deal with spirits!" is said

00:29:53.999 --> 00:29:55.999
by all the great people of the world,

00:29:56.333 --> 00:29:59.875
but we are not bothered, you see. "What's wrong?"

00:30:00.709 --> 00:30:04.999
We go to spirits, to ESP, to our elders who are dead,

00:30:05.208 --> 00:30:09.083
to our brothers and sisters, why bother them now they are dead,

00:30:09.375 --> 00:30:11.291
let them be free. As it is, you tortured

00:30:11.542 --> 00:30:13.208
their lives when they lived on this earth.

00:30:13.458 --> 00:30:15.375
Why don't you leave them free?

00:30:15.625 --> 00:30:18.917
Let them go and take their births. But we are not satisfied.

00:30:19.166 --> 00:30:21.208
We say no, we must talk to them. We have blind seers,

00:30:21.458 --> 00:30:23.875
we hold hands, call spirits and do this.

00:30:24.125 --> 00:30:25.750
But do you know what happens with them?

00:30:25.999 --> 00:30:27.625
First of all, no realization.

00:30:27.917 --> 00:30:29.458
Very difficult for such people.

00:30:29.709 --> 00:30:31.500
Even if you get realization and all that,

00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:35.041
you have lots of problems, I've seen people go mad,

00:30:35.250 --> 00:30:37.417
because these spirits are dirty things.

00:30:37.667 --> 00:30:41.291
Supposing you have called Me, I am an Indian,

00:30:41.542 --> 00:30:43.542
so now you are exposed to India.

00:30:43.792 --> 00:30:45.333
You must know you are exposed to India

00:30:45.583 --> 00:30:49.250
and you have no control over the people who are coming down

00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:52.417
from these areas and you are just engulfed.

00:30:52.667 --> 00:30:55.999
They possess you. They possess you, your family everything

00:30:56.208 --> 00:31:02.166
and is a fact that these horrible things that act

00:31:02.458 --> 00:31:05.750
or that call or that try to show that they are

00:31:05.999 --> 00:31:09.917
helping you, are the people who are just taking money from you.

00:31:10.125 --> 00:31:13.375
But they are going to be condemned much worse than anyone.

00:31:13.625 --> 00:31:15.834
The people who are the mediums who are clairvoyants,

00:31:16.041 --> 00:31:18.583
have used these things and all this, we'll call these

00:31:18.875 --> 00:31:20.959
Guru's from Tibet, there's nothing like that.

00:31:21.208 --> 00:31:24.291
Anybody who's a realised soul will never do that.

00:31:24.542 --> 00:31:27.667
Any realised soul will never come into anybody.

00:31:27.917 --> 00:31:30.583
No Guru can come into anybody, take it from Me

00:31:30.834 --> 00:31:33.834
because they know the value of freedom.

00:31:34.291 --> 00:31:36.709
They will never do it. It's a very mean thing to do.

00:31:36.999 --> 00:31:39.166
To them who are dead and to yourself

00:31:39.417 --> 00:31:43.083
who is living and is such a beautiful thing created by God.

00:31:43.417 --> 00:31:45.625
You get possessed by all these nonsensical things

00:31:45.917 --> 00:31:47.792
and black magic and /?/

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.999
I don't know how you educated people can take to it,

00:31:51.250 --> 00:31:54.041
perhaps you are very naive, I would say that, you are naive.

00:31:54.291 --> 00:31:56.583
Because in India we know this,

00:31:56.875 --> 00:31:59.999
we know all this, we know all this materialisation and all business,

00:32:00.208 --> 00:32:02.083
we know very well. Of course, I mean

00:32:02.375 --> 00:32:04.417
all the young people do not know now, because

00:32:04.625 --> 00:32:08.083
I am an ancient person, we all knew about it,

00:32:08.333 --> 00:32:12.083
we call it Branumati, we call it Pret Vidya, Smashan Vidya,

00:32:12.333 --> 00:32:14.834
Bhoot Vidya, there are books and books about it,

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:16.917
what these things are done.

00:32:17.125 --> 00:32:19.458
There are black magic, voodoo,

00:32:19.667 --> 00:32:21.125
and all sorts of things that you call it,

00:32:21.375 --> 00:32:23.959
but you have no knowledge about it. Now for example

00:32:24.208 --> 00:32:27.375
we put all our dead bodies in the church, it is very dangerous

00:32:27.667 --> 00:32:30.166
I don't know who told, where is it written in the Bible,

00:32:30.417 --> 00:32:33.709
I don't understand, why should you put your dead bodies in the church.

00:32:33.999 --> 00:32:36.750
Alright, if you want to have a church for the dead bodies,

00:32:36.999 --> 00:32:38.583
let them be along with the dead bodies,

00:32:38.834 --> 00:32:41.834
you are living people, why do you sit on top of dead bodies there

00:32:42.041 --> 00:32:43.291
and have all the bhoots

00:32:43.542 --> 00:32:45.999
these devils coming on you and sitting on your heads?

00:32:46.208 --> 00:32:50.083
Only a realised soul is a the person who should be buried in a church,

00:32:50.375 --> 00:32:54.458
only a realised soul. In India, it is a custom that all people are burned

00:32:54.750 --> 00:32:57.166
except for a realised soul,

00:32:58.041 --> 00:33:01.375
because they never try to

00:33:03.041 --> 00:33:06.917
possess anyone, they never try to disturb, on the contrary, they help

00:33:07.125 --> 00:33:09.125
in so many ways, they are not the people

00:33:09.375 --> 00:33:12.750
who will just come to disturb your life or to

00:33:12.959 --> 00:33:16.041
give you some encouragement, sometimes you feel very happy also with that

00:33:16.375 --> 00:33:22.375
because you feel that we can say your responsibility is taken over,

00:33:22.667 --> 00:33:25.291
they have taken your responsibility and you feel quite relieved,

00:33:25.542 --> 00:33:27.875
in the beginning you feel quite nice, it's a good sensation:

00:33:28.083 --> 00:33:29.709
"Oh I feel peace within me",

00:33:29.959 --> 00:33:31.750
because somebody else has come into your house

00:33:31.999 --> 00:33:34.834
and he is going to use all your house and you'll be left behind.

00:33:35.041 --> 00:33:37.417
And then you become ridiculous.

00:33:37.667 --> 00:33:40.375
Such people you'll find put the cloth in the mouth like this,

00:33:40.625 --> 00:33:44.333
look like that, and they are very much frightened and afraid.

00:33:44.542 --> 00:33:48.917
Of course before me they shake like this, all sorts of things happen.

00:33:51.917 --> 00:33:53.542
Now there is another trend about it,

00:33:53.834 --> 00:33:56.500
that if you say that these are possessed people, and this and that,

00:33:56.750 --> 00:34:00.166
so the left side ones are even worse.

00:34:00.625 --> 00:34:03.917
Left side ones are the people who go into the spirit business, very much,

00:34:04.166 --> 00:34:05.792
but there are two types of spirit business,

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:09.125
one can give supra-concious, and one can give even subconscious,

00:34:09.333 --> 00:34:11.542
and the subconscious is very easily available

00:34:11.834 --> 00:34:13.625
because they are busy bodies all these spirits,

00:34:13.875 --> 00:34:15.999
it's on the subconscious area they are busy bodies

00:34:16.208 --> 00:34:18.999
and very mean and sly and dirty people.

00:34:19.250 --> 00:34:23.208
For example a woman dies young without marriage,

00:34:23.458 --> 00:34:28.500
she would like to trouble a married woman, she's jealous.

00:34:29.166 --> 00:34:32.500
And that's why there are certain rules and regulations in our life.

00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:36.000
One should understand by which you should avoid all these things.

00:34:36.250 --> 00:34:40.417
Take your psychologists. Psychologists do not know what they're facing.

00:34:40.667 --> 00:34:43.333
They treat mad people. I told you about Freud,

00:34:43.583 --> 00:34:47.208
he was half baked because he only knew about this desire.

00:34:47.458 --> 00:34:49.999
Power of desire which he called conditioning and all that.

00:34:50.166 --> 00:34:53.875
But he did not know there was another one which is our ego,

00:34:54.083 --> 00:34:55.999
so he said you take out all your conditioning,

00:34:56.208 --> 00:34:57.834
you don't have any conditioning whatsoever.

00:34:57.999 --> 00:35:00.291
So where do you go, you land up in: "What's wrong?"

00:35:00.583 --> 00:35:03.417
Ego oriented. Then you form another

00:35:03.709 --> 00:35:06.000
cult by saying we must destroy our cult.

00:35:06.250 --> 00:35:08.041
You go on saying that to yourself: "Oh you are good for nothing,

00:35:08.291 --> 00:35:09.375
you are useless,

00:35:09.583 --> 00:35:14.291
all the time kill your ego, so you become a recluse,

00:35:14.999 --> 00:35:17.834
these two things happen with extremes

00:35:18.083 --> 00:35:20.542
of this movement of this centre.

00:35:20.792 --> 00:35:24.166
Through this centre you either go to the left or the right.

00:35:24.458 --> 00:35:29.875
Now what is the real thing, this is the centre of creativity.

00:35:30.166 --> 00:35:33.709
Creativity and the knowledge of the Divine.

00:35:33.999 --> 00:35:37.917
Knowledge of the Divine is when you get your realisation,

00:35:38.166 --> 00:35:43.999
you get these cool vibrations of the Holy Ghost

00:35:44.208 --> 00:35:47.625
and you have to know how to raise the Kundalini of others,

00:35:47.917 --> 00:35:49.999
and you have to know how to correct yourself.

00:35:50.250 --> 00:35:53.166
You have to know how to know all of these centres

00:35:53.417 --> 00:35:54.834
and also you have to find out

00:35:55.041 --> 00:35:58.291
all the absolute questions you have got within your mind.

00:35:58.583 --> 00:36:01.333
This has to happen to you. This realization

00:36:01.583 --> 00:36:04.458
has to happen because this is in your own right you are having.

00:36:04.750 --> 00:36:07.792
Now you are a human being and you have to become a super human being.

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:09.291
I'm not doing anything about it

00:36:09.583 --> 00:36:12.166
as I said, I'm just cashing your bank accounts

00:36:12.417 --> 00:36:14.917
But if bank accounts are so much on the left or right

00:36:15.125 --> 00:36:17.959
it's rather difficult, you have to give lots of grace marks

00:36:18.166 --> 00:36:21.625
and sort of overdrafts are there.

00:36:22.083 --> 00:36:25.959
So one has to understand that better be in the center.

00:36:26.250 --> 00:36:29.834
Not to go to these things. Why, why, for what?

00:36:30.041 --> 00:36:31.999
What are you going to gain out of these things?

00:36:32.208 --> 00:36:34.083
Are you going to go to your spirit?

00:36:34.333 --> 00:36:35.999
Are you going to become yourself?

00:36:36.208 --> 00:36:39.375
Why? Just for a little gain here and a little gain there?

00:36:39.583 --> 00:36:42.999
Why are you going to these horrible people? They will take you

00:36:43.208 --> 00:36:47.999
to such a horrible extreme that maybe you may not be able to return.

00:36:48.542 --> 00:36:50.959
In London I was surprised, there was a doctor

00:36:51.208 --> 00:36:53.291
whom I knew by relationship,

00:36:53.542 --> 00:36:56.041
and he came to see Me and he said: "I've lost all my jobs,

00:36:56.250 --> 00:36:58.959
everything because I'm very depressed I can't work.

00:36:59.166 --> 00:37:01.208
I don't know what happens to me. I'm extremely depressed.

00:37:01.458 --> 00:37:03.583
I've lost zest to work.

00:37:03.875 --> 00:37:05.709
I do not feel anything I'm just gone case.

00:37:05.959 --> 00:37:07.375
I'm very depressed.

00:37:07.625 --> 00:37:10.000
And everytime I try to work I get again depressed.

00:37:10.250 --> 00:37:11.917
I'm very tired."

00:37:12.125 --> 00:37:13.999
I asked him: "Did he go to anyone of these

00:37:14.208 --> 00:37:17.375
tantrics and this type of person?" - "Never"

00:37:17.709 --> 00:37:20.999
But my grandfather was tantric.

00:37:22.875 --> 00:37:24.999
He used to do this black magic business

00:37:25.208 --> 00:37:27.999
and now see the grandson is suffering because of it.

00:37:28.250 --> 00:37:31.291
Later on he was cured. We have one Australian

00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:34.458
here who was a Russian doctor, his grandmother

00:37:34.709 --> 00:37:38.083
had a habit of taking the child to the cemetery in the

00:37:38.375 --> 00:37:40.917
early ages of his life. He remembers that very well

00:37:41.125 --> 00:37:43.875
and after some time he became so depressed

00:37:44.083 --> 00:37:45.917
he lost his job, I mean he couldn't work.

00:37:46.125 --> 00:37:48.542
He used to get a headache and all sorts of things use to happen.

00:37:48.792 --> 00:37:51.458
Cramps use to come in his hands.

00:37:51.709 --> 00:37:54.542
When he came to me he got cured but it took

00:37:54.792 --> 00:37:56.166
some time because in childhood

00:37:56.417 --> 00:37:59.291
all the impressions of these spirits were there.

00:37:59.875 --> 00:38:03.792
So one has to understand how to keep dead away from you.

00:38:04.041 --> 00:38:06.999
You have to be in the present and not in the dead.

00:38:07.166 --> 00:38:08.999
Whosoever is dead is finished.

00:38:09.208 --> 00:38:11.291
Have you ever noticed a monkey,

00:38:11.542 --> 00:38:14.208
if a child of a monkey dies, before the death

00:38:14.458 --> 00:38:17.500
the monkey will be shouting and screa- ming and doing all sorts of things?

00:38:17.792 --> 00:38:21.333
As soon as the thing dies, it leaves. It's not bothered.

00:38:21.625 --> 00:38:23.500
The same with dogs and so many things,

00:38:23.792 --> 00:38:27.125
it is not bothered about it, it knows it's gone.

00:38:29.083 --> 00:38:33.250
That's why it's said that if somebody is dead, think of God

00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:35.709
and you sing songs and things like that,

00:38:35.959 --> 00:38:37.999
do not indulge into it too much.

00:38:38.250 --> 00:38:39.834
But we have forgotten all those things

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.375
and the way we do about dead things sometimes,

00:38:42.667 --> 00:38:46.999
it is so far, that actually most of us live that when doing all this,

00:38:47.291 --> 00:38:49.458
we live in the past only.

00:38:49.709 --> 00:38:52.417
We live in the past and such people see some ghosts and

00:38:52.625 --> 00:38:56.125
things and some of them who are like this have seen my past

00:38:56.375 --> 00:38:58.041
and have been shaking before Me,

00:38:58.250 --> 00:38:59.875
they all shake before Me just like this.

00:39:00.083 --> 00:39:02.834
They all shake, they cannot sit straight

00:39:03.041 --> 00:39:05.792
they go on shaking like this, they go on shaking like that,

00:39:05.999 --> 00:39:09.458
all the time their bodies shaking, they have no control over their body.

00:39:09.750 --> 00:39:14.250
So one has to understand that these things are absolutely

00:39:14.458 --> 00:39:15.583
dangerous for human beings.

00:39:15.792 --> 00:39:17.959
We are human beings we are not dead bodies,

00:39:18.125 --> 00:39:21.667
we are not that. But the worst thing is

00:39:21.917 --> 00:39:23.875
that those who indulge into these things

00:39:24.083 --> 00:39:26.542
are caught up by the proteins which doctors have said

00:39:26.792 --> 00:39:28.875
are nothing but these dead spirits.

00:39:29.083 --> 00:39:31.792
They are saying proteins because they don't understand.

00:39:31.999 --> 00:39:34.750
These are the dead spirits, cancer is caused

00:39:34.959 --> 00:39:38.250
only by the attack of the dead spirits.

00:39:39.750 --> 00:39:42.375
I have not come across a single case

00:39:42.625 --> 00:39:44.750
whom I have treated, I have treated many,

00:39:44.999 --> 00:39:49.083
who has not got the affectation of the spirit.

00:39:49.333 --> 00:39:52.709
Now in realisation when you get your realisation, you catch up

00:39:52.959 --> 00:39:56.291
on this or this, these are the two Swadisthana which were marked.

00:39:56.625 --> 00:39:58.208
Now I hope you put your hands like this,

00:39:58.458 --> 00:39:59.999
you will get your realisation

00:40:00.250 --> 00:40:01.792
as well when I'm talking to you. Just like this

00:40:01.999 --> 00:40:05.583
put both the feet straight on the ground, just like this.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:38.542
Now I was telling you that

00:40:38.834 --> 00:40:40.792
when you put your hands like this,

00:40:40.999 --> 00:40:43.208
first the cool breeze starts flowing in.

00:40:43.458 --> 00:40:44.417
All right?

00:40:44.667 --> 00:40:46.875
But when you have got your realisation

00:40:47.125 --> 00:40:49.709
you put your hand on somebody to test it,

00:40:49.959 --> 00:40:53.041
you catch on this one. That means it is unauthorised.

00:40:53.333 --> 00:40:58.458
Unauthorised working of the Divine

00:40:58.709 --> 00:41:00.375
can be subconscious areas,

00:41:00.583 --> 00:41:02.375
can be supra-conscious, can be psychologists

00:41:02.583 --> 00:41:05.792
or anyone can catch on this. When you work on your mind.

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.000
Your mind is the one that is the superego,

00:41:08.250 --> 00:41:12.583
there, the blue one is the mind and when you have

00:41:12.875 --> 00:41:16.250
somehow or other, gone to some person or have had

00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:18.959
something to do with black magic yourself,

00:41:19.166 --> 00:41:22.750
then you catch on this - is left Swadisthana, as we call it,

00:41:22.999 --> 00:41:28.083
and when you catch on this, you have to say that you believe

00:41:28.333 --> 00:41:33.125
in the Divine working - In the pure working of the Divine

00:41:33.333 --> 00:41:36.999
and that's called as Nirmala Vidya. Nirmala means - pure,

00:41:37.208 --> 00:41:44.999
the pure knowledge of the technique of how to raise your Kundalini.

00:41:45.208 --> 00:41:50.083
When you say that, this gets alright and the spirits leave you.

00:41:50.375 --> 00:41:53.834
There are many people who have come to Me who have been mad,

00:41:54.041 --> 00:41:56.834
and they say: "How by Kundalini do you cure mad people?"

00:41:57.041 --> 00:42:02.291
What do you do about it. Nothing, I just give them Kundalini awakening.

00:42:02.999 --> 00:42:06.625
Then when the Kundalini awakens, when She goes to this centre,

00:42:06.875 --> 00:42:09.458
which is the second centre within us,

00:42:09.750 --> 00:42:11.083
the enlightenment takes place.

00:42:11.333 --> 00:42:14.333
The deity there of creativity gets awakened

00:42:14.583 --> 00:42:19.291
and with the light this darkness within you just disappears.

00:42:19.583 --> 00:42:21.709
Just goes away. Epilepsy can be cured.

00:42:21.959 --> 00:42:24.542
If somebody is suffering from epilepsy

00:42:24.792 --> 00:42:28.792
there's a very simple method of curing that person. Extremely simple.

00:42:28.999 --> 00:42:33.166
When you come next I'll tell you how to get such a person cured.

00:42:33.458 --> 00:42:37.250
It is very simple. Sahaja Yoga is a spontaneous living method

00:42:37.542 --> 00:42:42.500
by which you can cure people as a by product of Kundalini awakening.

00:42:42.792 --> 00:42:45.625
It's not that I'm here as a healer and I'm going about:

00:42:45.875 --> 00:42:50.125
"Give me ten, /what you call/ dollars for healing."

00:42:50.375 --> 00:42:53.917
It's not that, it's just when Kun- dalini gets awakened, you get cured.

00:42:54.166 --> 00:42:57.417
You get a good health because the Kundalini

00:42:57.750 --> 00:43:02.375
passes through this centre which is responsible for the physical side.

00:43:02.875 --> 00:43:04.625
If your physical side is alright,

00:43:04.917 --> 00:43:07.959
then your health is alright. But there are other things within you.

00:43:08.208 --> 00:43:11.041
There is your emotional side and there is also you have got

00:43:11.250 --> 00:43:17.083
your mental side and also you have got above all is the spiritual.

00:43:17.333 --> 00:43:20.917
All these things are to be enligh- tened through Kundalini awakening.

00:43:21.125 --> 00:43:22.750
The first thing that happens to you is

00:43:22.999 --> 00:43:25.834
that your health improves, no doubt.

00:43:26.041 --> 00:43:32.542
All kinds of things like paralysis, cancer, diabetes -

00:43:32.792 --> 00:43:34.917
diabetes is curable by Sahaja Yoga.

00:43:35.166 --> 00:43:38.750
This I must explain to you how diabetes is cured.

00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:44.083
Diabetes is caused by people who think too much again.

00:43:44.417 --> 00:43:48.291
Who think too much, so this, the centre has to work very hard

00:43:48.583 --> 00:43:53.875
and it cannot give sufficient attention to the pancreas

00:43:54.125 --> 00:43:55.999
which is on the left hand side.

00:43:56.250 --> 00:43:58.792
Because of that the left hand side

00:43:59.041 --> 00:44:01.000
becomes frozen and the right hand side

00:44:01.250 --> 00:44:06.000
is working very hard. Now how do you cure your diabetes.

00:44:06.375 --> 00:44:08.417
Only way is if you are a realised soul,

00:44:08.667 --> 00:44:10.750
you give vibrations to the pancreas

00:44:10.999 --> 00:44:15.250
and give a balance to a person. There's a way of balancing it.

00:44:15.500 --> 00:44:16.792
If you can balance the thing,

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:19.999
people get rid of their diabetes permanently.

00:44:20.625 --> 00:44:24.999
Arthritis also can be cured, but now I must tell you about the spleen.

00:44:25.208 --> 00:44:27.542
Which is a very important thing within us and I think

00:44:27.750 --> 00:44:31.417
everyone of you must understand it in a full way.

00:44:31.999 --> 00:44:35.375
Spleen, we do not know how important it is within us.

00:44:35.625 --> 00:44:40.041
It is the speedometer. It looks after the speed we have.

00:44:40.333 --> 00:44:44.792
The way we are speedy these days. We are really telescoping it.

00:44:44.999 --> 00:44:48.000
We talk telescopically. We walk telescopically.

00:44:48.291 --> 00:44:52.041
We are very speedy people. And this speedness comes to us

00:44:52.333 --> 00:44:56.208
when the spleen has gone crazy. How does the spleen go crazy.

00:44:56.458 --> 00:45:02.500
It's very simple. Now spleen is there to create new blood corpuscles,

00:45:02.750 --> 00:45:04.999
red corpuscles to beat

00:45:05.250 --> 00:45:07.125
all the emergencies you go through.

00:45:07.375 --> 00:45:11.458
For example: you are eating your food and it's an emergency.

00:45:11.709 --> 00:45:14.667
You need more of the red blood corpuscles.

00:45:14.959 --> 00:45:18.083
So this spleen starts emitting more red blood corpuscles

00:45:18.291 --> 00:45:20.250
but at the same time you have the 9 o'clock

00:45:20.500 --> 00:45:22.999
news and you hear something horrid,

00:45:23.208 --> 00:45:24.999
another emergency is created.

00:45:25.250 --> 00:45:27.667
Then suddenly you eat your food and run.

00:45:27.917 --> 00:45:29.417
Third emergency is created.

00:45:29.709 --> 00:45:33.375
Poor spleen gets absolutely crazy, crazy.

00:45:33.667 --> 00:45:37.417
It does not know when to produce what blood cells. It doesn't know

00:45:37.625 --> 00:45:39.875
what to do with you because

00:45:40.125 --> 00:45:42.041
suddenly you have three or four, things together

00:45:42.250 --> 00:45:45.542
you've been having your breakfast, putting one foot on the car,

00:45:45.834 --> 00:45:48.500
you've been having your breakfest, talking to somebody that side.

00:45:48.750 --> 00:45:52.166
Here is somebody just saying: "Get in, get in!" And all this going on

00:45:52.417 --> 00:45:56.583
simultaneously. Poor this spleen doesn't know which way to move.

00:45:56.834 --> 00:46:00.250
So it becomes goes crazy. And then the attack comes somehow

00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:02.667
and blood cancer is set in.

00:46:02.917 --> 00:46:07.625
Blood cancer is the result of speediness.

00:46:08.250 --> 00:46:10.500
So one has to be very careful

00:46:10.709 --> 00:46:12.834
that our spleen must be alright.

00:46:13.041 --> 00:46:15.250
I am warning you as a Mother.

00:46:15.458 --> 00:46:18.792
I know these problems. We have cured blood cancer

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:22.166
but it's a horrible disease and once it gets over,

00:46:22.375 --> 00:46:25.291
within one week they say - finished. Now, we have cured

00:46:25.500 --> 00:46:28.792
many patients of blood cancer which were declared to be dead

00:46:28.999 --> 00:46:30.959
after eight days. You see that's all they give a certificate.

00:46:31.125 --> 00:46:34.875
After eight days or after one month, this certificate you get

00:46:35.083 --> 00:46:37.875
in the hospital, you will die.

00:46:38.041 --> 00:46:41.792
But in Sahaja Yoga one can try

00:46:41.999 --> 00:46:43.250
to cure them. They have been cured

00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:45.291
and when they went to the doctors all they say:

00:46:45.542 --> 00:46:46.999
"Oh I know it was very remarkable

00:46:47.208 --> 00:46:48.709
but we cant believe it was Sahaja Yoga."

00:46:48.959 --> 00:46:52.750
Even if a doctor is cured, they say: "Oh this doctor has gone mad now.

00:46:52.999 --> 00:46:54.792
He's talking like this, how can that be?"

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:58.083
Here they have certified the person is going to die in eight days

00:46:58.291 --> 00:47:01.041
and there he is cured and going strong after two years or so.

00:47:01.291 --> 00:47:04.375
They'll say there must be something, they do not want to accept

00:47:04.625 --> 00:47:06.999
because this challenges their knowledge.

00:47:07.166 --> 00:47:09.999
But I am not here to take away their profession.

00:47:10.208 --> 00:47:13.250
They can have lots of patients. I am not here to cure people.

00:47:13.542 --> 00:47:16.000
It's just the seekers

00:47:16.250 --> 00:47:19.333
who come to Me for realisation are blessed

00:47:19.583 --> 00:47:23.834
by Divine grace and they get very good health. They get cured

00:47:23.999 --> 00:47:28.125
because they are seekers. They are the men of God,

00:47:28.417 --> 00:47:30.917
and they have to become the prophets.

00:47:31.125 --> 00:47:34.709
And when they become the prophets in this era,

00:47:34.959 --> 00:47:37.875
they have to convert others in the same way

00:47:38.083 --> 00:47:39.458
and they will make them prophets.

00:47:39.709 --> 00:47:41.917
It's said by William Blake about a hundred years back.

00:47:42.166 --> 00:47:44.625
He has described all these things in his book Milton.

00:47:44.875 --> 00:47:46.709
You will be surprised. He has gone

00:47:46.917 --> 00:47:49.999
to such a limit of prophecy and he was such a seer

00:47:50.208 --> 00:47:53.917
that he has even described where I lived, in Surrey Hills:

00:47:54.166 --> 00:47:57.291
"The first beacons will be lit in Surrey Hills," and also

00:47:57.542 --> 00:47:59.792
he has said where our ashram is going to be

00:47:59.999 --> 00:48:01.959
in the ruins because we had no money so they purchased

00:48:02.166 --> 00:48:05.500
a ruined place in the ruins - "the foundations will be laid in

00:48:05.792 --> 00:48:10.542
Lambeth Way" and there it is. Our ashram it has come to Lambeth Way

00:48:10.834 --> 00:48:16.875
and here is the... and... "and Her loom vibrates the city of love,"

00:48:17.083 --> 00:48:19.125
and Lambeth Way and Lambeth Way and he says

00:48:19.417 --> 00:48:22.250
this is going to become the Jerusalem. Just imagine

00:48:22.500 --> 00:48:26.041
a person one hundred years back could see. He was such a seer

00:48:26.291 --> 00:48:28.999
and he has written all about it but human beings

00:48:29.208 --> 00:48:32.291
are not sensitive to things.

00:48:32.542 --> 00:48:35.125
I went to see his exhibition. He was a great artist.

00:48:35.375 --> 00:48:36.875
I was amazed they were just seeing

00:48:37.041 --> 00:48:39.999
how he has shown nude women in the hell,

00:48:40.208 --> 00:48:43.083
just imagine. You went there to see this?

00:48:43.333 --> 00:48:46.333
I mean this is like you went to see a flower show

00:48:46.583 --> 00:48:51.291
and there you are picking up all the filth and dirt.

00:48:51.500 --> 00:48:53.999
Is this the way to look at beautiful things?

00:48:54.208 --> 00:48:58.000
See for beauty and think of beauty and then you are beauty.

00:48:58.291 --> 00:49:01.834
Why should you desire these ugly things in life?

00:49:02.083 --> 00:49:04.834
Why should you not desire something that is so beautiful

00:49:05.083 --> 00:49:06.792
and that's your Spirit.

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:09.417
This is the second centre I have told you.

00:49:09.667 --> 00:49:12.500
This is the one which limits - which limits

00:49:12.750 --> 00:49:17.333
our religion in the sense of our sustenance.

00:49:17.625 --> 00:49:19.542
Not the religion in the way you understand.

00:49:19.792 --> 00:49:23.166
Because all these religions are just like flowers

00:49:23.458 --> 00:49:28.417
on one living tree. They have been plucked by people

00:49:28.750 --> 00:49:32.166
and they say: "This is mine. This is mine. This is mine!"

00:49:32.417 --> 00:49:35.291
And they have made these flowers very ugly

00:49:35.542 --> 00:49:38.458
and such flowers are decayed.

00:49:38.709 --> 00:49:42.333
The whole attention should be on becoming the Spirit.

00:49:42.583 --> 00:49:45.750
If it is not, so the rest of it is not God's work.

00:49:45.999 --> 00:49:49.959
God's work is just to awaken your Kundalini. It is the living work

00:49:50.208 --> 00:49:52.999
because if He is the living God, He has to do the living work.

00:49:53.250 --> 00:49:58.125
His work is to transform a little flower into a fruit,

00:49:58.417 --> 00:50:01.834
which you cannot do. In the same way you cannot pulsate the Kundalini

00:50:02.083 --> 00:50:04.583
but it will pulsate when you come to Sahaja Yoga.

00:50:04.834 --> 00:50:07.834
You will see with your naked eyes the pulsation rising over

00:50:08.041 --> 00:50:11.041
here and you can see your Baptism taking place.

00:50:11.291 --> 00:50:12.709
It is written by so many people,

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:15.500
and they have said like Kabir Das has clearly said...

00:50:15.750 --> 00:50:19.166
we had a great poet called Kabir Das who has described Sahaja Yoga

00:50:19.417 --> 00:50:22.709
about three, four hundred years back.

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:25.709
And we had Adi Shankaracharya who has very clearly

00:50:25.959 --> 00:50:29.625
said all these things I am telling you. But this was a knowledge limited

00:50:29.875 --> 00:50:33.083
to a few people. Even Krishna talked to one, Arjuna.

00:50:33.291 --> 00:50:36.375
Christ talked to some multitudes and they crucified Him

00:50:36.667 --> 00:50:38.750
because they couldn't understand Him, what He was talking.

00:50:38.999 --> 00:50:41.417
What was there to crucify Him? They did not recognise Him.

00:50:41.709 --> 00:50:43.750
Moses - how many people recognized him?

00:50:43.999 --> 00:50:45.999
Abraham - how many people recognized him?

00:50:46.250 --> 00:50:48.834
They were never recognized, never understood,

00:50:49.083 --> 00:50:52.959
that was the problem, and this is what one has to understand.

00:50:54.291 --> 00:50:56.041
The time has come now

00:50:56.333 --> 00:50:58.333
to recognise, to understand.

00:50:58.583 --> 00:51:01.291
Recognise yourself that you are the Spirit -

00:51:01.500 --> 00:51:04.250
not this body, not this mind, not this ego -

00:51:04.583 --> 00:51:07.999
but you are the Spirit. And not the Gurus, so called.

00:51:08.208 --> 00:51:12.875
The one who does not give you spiritual realisation is

00:51:13.083 --> 00:51:15.542
not a Guru, is not a guru.

00:51:15.792 --> 00:51:18.333
You must understand this is the thing of Guru.

00:51:18.667 --> 00:51:20.834
The Primordial Master who tells you

00:51:21.041 --> 00:51:22.792
to be in the centre, who tells you

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:26.458
all things that are to be done in the name of religion,

00:51:26.750 --> 00:51:29.875
in the name of religion everyone has said the same thing.

00:51:30.083 --> 00:51:31.999
Now I don't say anything like that

00:51:32.250 --> 00:51:34.250
because I know how to handle the situation.

00:51:34.583 --> 00:51:38.709
We had a doctor in London

00:51:39.208 --> 00:51:43.542
who was an alcoholic who came to Me. He got his realisation and

00:51:44.083 --> 00:51:46.999
the next day he gave up. He just didn't want to have it. He said:

00:51:47.250 --> 00:51:50.208
"Now I am enjoying myself. I'm not bored I don't even remember it."

00:51:50.458 --> 00:51:54.333
But he went to Germany and he said that after two to three months,

00:51:54.542 --> 00:51:57.208
he said I used to like one wine, let me try how it is.

00:51:57.500 --> 00:51:58.999
So he went and had that wine.

00:51:59.208 --> 00:52:01.125
When he had it, he felt like vomiting, absolutely,

00:52:01.375 --> 00:52:04.125
he said it was smelling like a cork put int the water.

00:52:04.375 --> 00:52:08.166
He never smelt like this before and just left like vomiting,

00:52:08.417 --> 00:52:10.959
it was very nausiating and he just gave it up.

00:52:11.208 --> 00:52:13.083
What happens really is that

00:52:13.333 --> 00:52:16.083
when you get your awakening, your own religion is just

00:52:16.333 --> 00:52:18.583
enlightened within you then and I don't have to tell you

00:52:18.875 --> 00:52:21.417
don't steal, don't talk filthy

00:52:21.667 --> 00:52:25.417
don't do this, nothing. Like My own daughter has

00:52:25.667 --> 00:52:29.375
a granddaughter, who is a realised soul. Two children,

00:52:29.667 --> 00:52:32.999
two granddaughters are realised souls and one of them came

00:52:33.208 --> 00:52:36.667
later on she said: "Grandmother, did you have to read this

00:52:36.959 --> 00:52:41.125
stupid thing called as moral science?" - I said: "No, why?"

00:52:41.417 --> 00:52:44.542
"This is foolish isn't it, they tell us not to tell lies,

00:52:44.792 --> 00:52:47.500
not to steal. I mean : "Why should we tell lies,

00:52:47.792 --> 00:52:49.999
why should they tell us all these things? I don't like it."

00:52:50.208 --> 00:52:52.834
So the little one says: "Oh, these are stupid people,

00:52:53.041 --> 00:52:54.917
how can they say like this, why should we do it?"

00:52:55.125 --> 00:52:56.625
There is no temptation there.

00:52:56.917 --> 00:53:00.875
We don't have to say you that type of temptation - you are awakened!

00:53:01.166 --> 00:53:04.041
Your dharma is there, your sustenance is awakened.

00:53:04.375 --> 00:53:09.333
Like we are human beings, if we have to pass through a dirty lane

00:53:09.625 --> 00:53:11.166
then we cannot do it.

00:53:11.417 --> 00:53:14.875
We feel horrible, we close our noses, we feel the smell of the dirt

00:53:15.125 --> 00:53:19.291
and the filth. But you take a horse, he'll go off very nicely,

00:53:19.583 --> 00:53:21.875
he's not bothered, he doesn't get disturbed.

00:53:22.083 --> 00:53:24.750
In the same way your awareness gets enlightened.

00:53:25.041 --> 00:53:29.583
Then whatever is sinful, you do not like. You just don't like it.

00:53:29.917 --> 00:53:31.999
Whatever takes you away from Spirit, you don't like

00:53:32.208 --> 00:53:33.917
because you lose your vibrations.

00:53:34.125 --> 00:53:38.792
Lose your vibrations. Now another centre is also very important.

00:53:39.083 --> 00:53:41.583
Which is for our wellbeing, called as Nabhi Chakra.

00:53:41.875 --> 00:53:43.834
About which I'll tell you next time

00:53:44.041 --> 00:53:46.500
because already I've told you quite elaborately.

00:53:46.792 --> 00:53:49.667
Moreover I would like to have questions from you today also,

00:53:49.917 --> 00:53:52.333
but like last time, don't go on asking questions

00:53:52.542 --> 00:53:54.959
and the same person asking. One person should ask only

00:53:55.208 --> 00:53:57.125
one question and a sensible question

00:53:57.417 --> 00:53:59.208
because you are seekers. Don't waste your time

00:53:59.500 --> 00:54:02.458
and don't waste time of others. Alright?

00:54:02.750 --> 00:54:04.917
Thank you very much.
