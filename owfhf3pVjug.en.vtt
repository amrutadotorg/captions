WEBVTT

00:10.070 --> 00:17.761
Yesterday’s experience was that
the whole day I had to spend it

00:17.786 --> 00:23.206
with police people explaining to them.

00:23.231 --> 00:30.805
And now I feel that in Maharashtra,
there is a rule of Mafia.

00:30.830 --> 00:38.952
And that it is for us to face it
and we have to prove it.

00:38.977 --> 00:42.270
I am sorry some people were hurt
so badly

00:42.295 --> 00:45.160
and I'll think after Puja they’ll take
you to the hospital.

00:45.185 --> 00:50.831
Here there is a very nice hospital where
we have very good doctors.

00:50.856 --> 01:04.950
And then I would request you
to know that,

01:05.805 --> 01:14.868
the evil and the good, always has
to struggle and fight.

01:14.893 --> 01:24.226
Formerly in this great country of
Maharashtra all the saints were tortured,

01:24.251 --> 01:31.531
to such an extent that it is amazing
how despite all that

01:31.555 --> 01:38.773
they kept the banner of spirituality
so high.

01:38.798 --> 01:48.945
They are still existing, the same people,

01:48.970 --> 01:53.428
who have tortured the saints and I think
they are the same people

01:53.453 --> 02:00.653
who have behaved in such a bad manner
towards you all.

02:01.948 --> 02:10.219
This kind of ego-trip builds up
in everyone

02:10.244 --> 02:14.265
– even in among sahaja yogis, it does
build up.

02:14.290 --> 02:20.777
And they are all the time
on a different scene.

02:20.802 --> 02:30.072
This is like Hitler's style of behavior
that you pick up some sort of an issue.

02:30.097 --> 02:33.388
An issue could be anything, like they
are saying that

02:33.413 --> 02:36.410
“we are trying to remove all the blind
faiths”. I mean,

02:36.435 --> 02:41.795
I've done this for eighteen years,
what can they do more than that?

02:41.820 --> 02:45.227
And I have removed all your blind faiths
in all kinds of stupid things

02:45.252 --> 02:48.799
that the religion, so-called, was teaching
you.

02:48.824 --> 02:53.082
In every religion, there is no question
of only Hindu religion.

02:53.107 --> 02:55.708
But here they dare not say anything
about the Muslims

02:55.733 --> 02:58.540
because the Hindus are very mild people.

02:58.565 --> 03:02.386
They (the muslims) want that
all the temples must be removed,

03:02.411 --> 03:06.243
all the deities must be thrown away.

03:06.268 --> 03:12.490
This is all I think Rajneesh is their guru
because he made a...

03:13.877 --> 03:23.830
he made an exhibition where he tried
to show

03:23.855 --> 03:28.002
that Ganapati was something very funny
and all that.

03:28.027 --> 03:30.732
Now medically you know in Sahaja Yoga,

03:30.732 --> 03:35.975
that without Ganesha we cannot cure
many diseases. Is a fact.

03:36.000 --> 03:40.158
So a stupid fellow talking like that,
has become now the guru of these people

03:40.183 --> 03:43.731
who are discarded all over the world
and who have been insulted.

03:43.756 --> 03:48.936
So these few newspapers have made
him as a guru, perhaps that

03:48.961 --> 03:53.290
they are following his methods of saying
that we should be,

03:53.315 --> 03:56.793
we should be rid of all these ideas
and this and that.

03:56.818 --> 04:04.210
But they have gone to the extent that
all the spirituality is an illusion.

04:05.575 --> 04:09.790
It's such a joke. And that we should
give up

04:09.815 --> 04:16.611
all the, all readings and all understanding
about spirituality.

04:16.611 --> 04:21.173
But they do not know that their heritage
is spirituality.

04:21.198 --> 04:24.636
And the whole world depends on that.

04:24.661 --> 04:29.129
The whole world, because when the people
took to industrial development,

04:29.154 --> 04:32.304
you know how far they have gone
and how much they are lost.

04:32.329 --> 04:36.142
And how far you were in that mess.
And how you came back

04:36.167 --> 04:38.924
because of Sahaja Yoga’s spirituality.

04:38.964 --> 04:46.732
Now if this nourishment from the roots
of spirituality

04:46.757 --> 04:51.591
does not reach the West, the real
knowledge, as it is in Sahaja Yoga,

04:51.616 --> 04:56.405
the West will be finished. West will be
finished, you know that very well.

04:56.430 --> 05:00.934
There is no joy, there is no love,
there is no poetry,

05:00.959 --> 05:05.230
there is no music, there is no culture.

05:07.025 --> 05:13.210
But as you have understood that now
these people have now started

05:13.235 --> 05:16.126
talking about “no religion”
“no religion”,

05:16.151 --> 05:19.259
like many of your western countries
have also done,

05:19.284 --> 05:21.762
specially Russia has done that way,

05:21.787 --> 05:24.706
that there is nothing like God,
there is nothing like this and that.

05:24.731 --> 05:28.745
And now after all that now they
are coming to God.

05:28.770 --> 05:32.139
So now we’ll have to go through
another circle.

05:32.164 --> 05:35.734
But they are only hardly twenty people.

05:35.759 --> 05:42.172
So even one fellow who is like Hitler,
can destroy the whole thing.

05:42.197 --> 05:48.546
This is a very important thing - to destroy
something you need only one person.

05:48.571 --> 05:56.814
But to sustain and to construct
you need many people.

05:56.839 --> 06:03.904
To drown a ship, you need only
one hole in it.

06:03.929 --> 06:10.075
But to build the ship, you take months
together.

06:10.100 --> 06:14.257
So the work that is done for these
last eighteen years

06:14.282 --> 06:17.965
of Sahaja Yoga, is really tremendous.

06:17.990 --> 06:21.165
And the truth about it, you know
for definite,

06:21.190 --> 06:26.252
that it has helped so many people. Though
we have been going from ups and downs

06:26.277 --> 06:29.874
and all that, we've been doing wrong
things, no doubt about it,

06:29.899 --> 06:36.353
but still, now we are quite established
and we know what Sahaja Yoga is.

06:36.378 --> 06:43.564
The experience of Sahaja Yoga you all
have had. We have seen so many,

06:43.589 --> 06:47.590
(towards someone…) “What is she doing?
Please be seated”.

06:48.521 --> 06:53.096
Miraculous photographs you have seen,
so many miracles in your life day to day.

06:53.121 --> 06:58.319
Every day there are miracles. Now to say
there is no God

06:58.344 --> 07:02.285
is impossible for you because you have
felt the miracles

07:02.310 --> 07:06.669
of this All-pervading Power,
the Paramchaitanya.

07:06.694 --> 07:10.115
And also all the religions are explained

07:10.140 --> 07:15.650
and the complete integration of them
has been brought in.

07:15.675 --> 07:21.113
But for that we have to know, as I told
you in Brahmapuri,

07:21.138 --> 07:25.586
that the sahaja yogis have to know that
they have to become dynamic.

07:25.611 --> 07:32.698
Whatever energies you have got, whatever
you have achieved within yourselves,

07:32.723 --> 07:37.798
is not sufficient enough. You have
to manifest.

07:37.823 --> 07:42.185
And in that dynamism, I think people
get lost.

07:42.210 --> 07:45.538
I have seen that some leaders become
horrid.

07:45.563 --> 07:50.348
I mean, sometimes their Vishuddhis could
be horrible, then their heart goes out.

07:50.384 --> 07:57.563
So you should not allow anybody (to be)
a leader for more than one month.

07:57.588 --> 08:02.765
It goes off. I have seen it. Because your
balloon has been already bloated

08:02.790 --> 08:08.441
and again it gets re-bloated in no time.
(speaking in Marathi…).

08:11.812 --> 08:18.546
They have religiously kept all the Indians
outside, I think. (speaking in Marathi…).

08:21.327 --> 08:24.477
I mean, he is the organizer here.

08:26.536 --> 08:29.803
(speaking Marathi)

08:32.358 --> 08:37.800
So the heritage of our country is
spirituality.

08:40.179 --> 08:44.340
And this is the nourishment.

08:44.365 --> 08:53.619
Only the one-sided growth in the West, due
to machinery or whatever you may call it,

08:54.487 --> 08:58.413
has ruined it completely.

08:58.438 --> 09:01.705
And one-sided growth in this country,
and all such countries,

09:01.730 --> 09:08.938
where religion has become a blind faith,
has also ruined it.

09:08.963 --> 09:13.726
But in the center lies Sahaja Yoga.

09:13.751 --> 09:20.821
Now your wisdom, your sense,
is so apparent.

09:20.846 --> 09:26.597
I mean, people have been to all kinds
of gurus here and have been to everyone,

09:26.622 --> 09:31.068
but they don’t know anything about
anything. Except for remembering by heart

09:31.093 --> 09:35.464
- some these Hare Ramas, talk about,
“Rama” “Rama” – like that.

09:35.489 --> 09:38.419
While you know everything about Kundalini.
You know how to raise it.

09:38.444 --> 09:41.799
You know how to give Realization. You know
what are the diseases are caused,

09:41.824 --> 09:45.916
how to cure it and everything and
everything and everything.

09:45.941 --> 09:52.003
I mean, it has come to such a stage
that nobody asks Me any questions.

09:54.381 --> 09:58.094
Otherwise, in the beginning in London,
My lecture was for five minutes

09:58.119 --> 10:03.651
and the questions were for the rest
of the time.

10:03.676 --> 10:08.282
So now you know so much.

10:10.731 --> 10:17.086
And you accept which cannot be explained
also, because you know that.

10:17.111 --> 10:22.164
For example, somebody will ask Me,
“Mother, how do you get these photographs?”

10:22.189 --> 10:25.763
Why are we talking about it?

10:25.788 --> 10:32.410
I know how it happens, who is doing
this trick. But I don’t want to tell you.

10:35.606 --> 10:37.760
Moreover, if you demand something,
I’ll never tell you.

10:37.785 --> 10:39.997
That’s one of the characters I have.

10:40.022 --> 10:45.045
Ah, if you come with humble thing
and honest desire to know,

10:45.070 --> 10:47.974
then I can tell you about everything,
that you want to know.

10:47.999 --> 10:50.991
But if you just want to force Me and say
that, “I challenge you”,

10:51.016 --> 10:53.909
I said, “I also challenge you.
Get out of here”.

10:53.934 --> 10:57.075
Like that. You see, it doesn’t react,
that way.

10:57.100 --> 11:03.328
So it is just the temperament
of the Divine

11:03.368 --> 11:10.292
that if you are convex, the Divine
becomes convex also,

11:10.317 --> 11:15.634
and fights and says, “No, get out”.
If you become concave,

11:15.659 --> 11:24.194
then it emits and gives knowledge,
or receives knowledge.

11:24.219 --> 11:30.185
So one has to be humble. That’s very
important part of it. One has to be humble.

11:30.210 --> 11:38.465
So the awareness, again I talk about
awareness,

11:38.490 --> 11:43.537
within you should be that, how much
we have come to know about ourselves.

11:43.562 --> 11:47.016
How much we have to come to know
about others?

11:47.041 --> 11:54.635
How much we know about our own being?
How much we know about chakras?

11:54.660 --> 11:58.501
In such a short time, how did we come
to know about it?

11:58.526 --> 12:02.550
Like we should know, if you are dealing
with a computer,

12:02.575 --> 12:09.809
and you know how computer works, how
it acts, how it is programmed, everything

12:09.834 --> 12:15.749
without programming it, without working
it out, without building it up.

12:15.774 --> 12:19.026
I mean, if you build it up, you know
how it works. But without doing that

12:19.051 --> 12:23.098
just to know a computer how it works,
and all the machinery about it,

12:23.123 --> 12:26.722
is a tremendous knowledge.

12:26.747 --> 12:30.399
And this is what has to be there
for all of us

12:30.424 --> 12:34.595
to know what we are there as human beings,
and what we have to do

12:34.722 --> 12:39.685
to emancipate the other human beings.

12:40.275 --> 12:44.700
Of course, I shouldn’t say that every
sahaja yogi is of that level, no.

12:44.725 --> 12:50.037
Or comes up, but everybody is trying.
Nobody has denied Sahaja Yoga.

12:50.062 --> 12:54.423
Nobody has said it’s not true. Everybody
is trying to get

12:54.448 --> 13:00.824
higher and higher in his state
of spirituality which doesn’t speak.

13:00.849 --> 13:07.447
It acts. It doesn’t manipulate. It acts.

13:07.472 --> 13:11.896
And we've seen it acts in so many
miraculous ways.

13:11.921 --> 13:17.514
So first to know about all these things,
after feeling that Paramchaitanya,

13:17.539 --> 13:21.791
is different from just to talk about it.

13:21.816 --> 13:25.897
Many have talked about it, but you have
never felt it.

13:25.922 --> 13:30.826
Now you have felt it, you have verified it,
you have experimented it.

13:30.851 --> 13:36.277
And you have found it that, this is
something absolutely real.

13:36.302 --> 13:44.741
In science, as Dr. Khan was telling Me,
that in science,

13:44.766 --> 13:51.415
the one theory which is established today
might be refuted tomorrow.

13:51.440 --> 13:55.953
Another theory that is established,
may be refuted.

13:55.978 --> 14:00.181
It goes on. So that no theory is
an absolute theory.

14:00.206 --> 14:04.979
But in Sahaja Yoga for the last eighteen
years, whatever I have been saying

14:05.004 --> 14:11.240
is the truth. And is absolute. It cannot
be challenged again.

14:11.265 --> 14:14.619
Nobody can say, “No, Mother,
it is not so”.

14:14.644 --> 14:20.073
A simple thing is, somebody comes to you
and you say, the other day it happened,

14:20.098 --> 14:26.561
one doctor was there in Aurangabad,
and he said that,

14:29.876 --> 14:35.103
“I have never had any guru”. But his left
Swadhistana…

14:35.128 --> 14:38.652
and he was looking very disturbed. He was
a sahaja yogi in a way,

14:38.677 --> 14:43.385
not looking normal. “I have pain
in the stomach,” and this and that.

14:43.410 --> 14:48.858
I asked him, “You had no guru?”,
he said, “No”. (speaking Marathi).

16:02.864 --> 16:07.984
So now as science has progressed
we can see clearly

16:08.009 --> 16:13.076
that it has not got the theory
which is absolute.

16:13.101 --> 16:18.953
But in Sahaja Yoga, as I told you,
there was a gentleman, a doctor,

16:18.978 --> 16:22.403
who was denying, he said, “I had no guru”.
I asked him, “Do you read books?”,

16:22.428 --> 16:28.693
“Yes – he said - I read Vivekananda”.
I said, “That’s it”.

16:28.718 --> 16:32.425
He said he was reading the book
of a particular guru.

16:32.450 --> 16:37.935
We gave a bandhan to that guru
and this fellow felt alright.

16:40.710 --> 16:44.649
There are so many things one has to know
about.

16:44.674 --> 16:52.359
Little, little things are there, which must
be understood in Sahaja Yoga.

16:52.384 --> 16:59.039
And one should do it according to them,
because it is for your benevolence.

16:59.064 --> 17:06.832
Now supposing I say, “Just do these
things”. If you don’t accept Me,

17:06.857 --> 17:10.509
why am I telling you? I am not telling you
because I have to gain anything.

17:10.534 --> 17:15.857
But is for your good. Now if you don’t
want to accept me or if you react,

17:15.882 --> 17:19.865
is not going to help you. Sahaja Yoga
is not for Me, is for you.

17:19.890 --> 17:24.094
Now if you are, truthfully, honestly,
if you are seekers,

17:24.119 --> 17:29.334
then you must know that "My aim
is to rise spiritually".

17:29.359 --> 17:32.035
Now in science you have risen quite a lot,
you are fed up with it.

17:32.060 --> 17:35.054
Now you’re back into spirituality

17:35.079 --> 17:38.827
and for spirituality you have to be
a subtler person.

17:38.853 --> 17:43.199
And for these subtleties you have
to give up all your conditionings.

17:43.224 --> 17:47.157
All funny conditionings are to be given
and the worst that you have,

17:47.182 --> 17:53.212
is the ego part. It just jumps up. I have
seen that appointing people leaders

17:53.245 --> 17:58.210
has been the greatest harmful thing
I have done to them.

17:58.235 --> 18:02.459
So many of them just got lost, because
they became leaders.

18:02.484 --> 18:07.428
I mean, a kind of a Hitler, enters
into them.

18:07.453 --> 18:10.677
So this is one of the worst conditionings
we have.

18:10.702 --> 18:17.369
We have to be very careful that we don’t
try to assert our ego on others.

18:17.394 --> 18:20.863
When we become leaders or a some position
is given to us,

18:20.888 --> 18:29.970
or ask something is to be achieved
through your authority.

18:29.995 --> 18:32.837
Only we have the authority of God.

18:32.862 --> 18:39.265
Unless and until we become humble
like that, nothing is going to flow.

18:39.290 --> 18:46.193
You can see that, that the sea lies
the lowest in height.

18:46.218 --> 18:50.336
And all the rivers and everything flows
to the sea.

18:50.361 --> 18:54.809
And from the sea only rises the rain.

18:54.834 --> 19:00.373
Supposing sea was somewhere on top
of Himalayas,

19:00.398 --> 19:10.843
we would have been all living
in the Sahara desert.

19:11.649 --> 19:17.525
Is a very simple thing, is to be humble
- that’s first sign - is to be humble,

19:17.550 --> 19:26.492
is to be non-violent, because we depend
on the All-pervading Power.

19:26.517 --> 19:31.498
It is a power which is completely
integrated within us.

19:31.523 --> 19:38.065
Only we are not the ones, we want
to be aware of it.

19:38.745 --> 19:43.508
So this ignorance, this blindness,
if it disappears from us,

19:43.541 --> 19:48.654
that Divine Power will manifest.

19:48.679 --> 19:53.891
But our styles are so complicated.

19:53.916 --> 19:57.645
Sometimes I just don’t understand,

19:58.243 --> 20:03.808
why we have complicated ourselves
so much.

20:03.833 --> 20:10.430
I mean, look at the flowers, look at
the leaves; they are on a tree, supposing.

20:10.455 --> 20:16.709
Automatically they will open out
to the sun. Automatically.

20:16.734 --> 20:20.147
You don’t have to take a leaf towards
the sun, not at all.

20:20.172 --> 20:22.951
Automatically it opens out. You have
seen it every day.

20:22.976 --> 20:26.209
Automatically. Because it requires sun.

20:26.234 --> 20:32.446
Now you want to have spirit in yourself.
You want to get to spirit.

20:32.471 --> 20:37.632
So automatically you should, really
automatically, if that is your desire,

20:37.657 --> 20:45.672
you should, with your own desire only,
should get to the light of the spirit.

20:45.697 --> 20:53.419
And should grow in that spirit to know
that this is what you have to achieve.

20:55.905 --> 20:59.409
But small things disturb you,

20:59.434 --> 21:03.791
like somebody doesn’t get married. Next
day you see the face of that person,

21:03.816 --> 21:08.913
as if somebody has died in the family
he is sitting there.

21:08.941 --> 21:15.956
Really, I have seen it. Immediately I make
out who has not been yet engaged.

21:18.277 --> 21:22.932
Then after marriage I find again
the same sort of nonsense.

21:22.957 --> 21:28.284
Because they are analyzing, “I want
this kind, I want that kind. I want”.

21:28.309 --> 21:33.515
I mean, whatever is available here
is available.

21:37.709 --> 21:43.663
Like on the ship, you don’t have any
problems, because you have no solutions.

21:43.688 --> 21:46.106
If you are moving on a ship and you
just ask for something,

21:46.131 --> 21:50.346
“Oh no, not available here,” finished.

21:53.985 --> 21:58.324
But then you lose all the fun of Sahaja
Yoga for a small little nonsensical thing.

21:58.349 --> 22:03.985
If not this, next year. What is
so important?

22:04.010 --> 22:10.437
I mean, certain there are limitations
of age, height, this, that.

22:10.462 --> 22:15.285
Then even if you arrange their marriages,
is very interesting,

22:15.310 --> 22:18.140
then they come and tell you, “No, no,
I would not like to marry this girl”.

22:18.165 --> 22:21.138
Why? “Because I want such and such”.
All right, then we find.

22:21.163 --> 22:24.075
“No, no, no, she is no good. She has
these things,” so move that.

22:24.100 --> 22:28.663
I mean this is not the way. You are not
here to choose a girl for yourself.

22:28.688 --> 22:32.511
Then there is another one who can say,
“All right, I came down, I saw one girl

22:32.536 --> 22:39.449
and fell in love”. So you fall in love
and get out. This nonsense going on.

22:39.474 --> 22:46.282
See, you must have certain amount
of dignity. You are all sahaja yogis.

22:46.314 --> 22:49.384
And when I see all this kind
of stupid attitude,

22:49.409 --> 22:54.824
I say these people can never gain
in Sahaja Yoga.

22:55.789 --> 23:01.513
In India you will be surprised. I mean,

23:02.251 --> 23:07.033
even I was married to a man who was
from another, another place.

23:07.058 --> 23:11.732
Absolutely different country, different
religion, different everything.

23:11.757 --> 23:13.890
And a different person.

23:13.915 --> 23:18.348
So one can say that it was a very
unconventional marriage, one can say.

23:18.373 --> 23:24.251
But I would never touch this man
or he would never touch me.

23:24.276 --> 23:28.943
And if he would talk to me,
in the presence of others only.

23:30.264 --> 23:35.304
And despite that, our marriage is very
strong and we are very happy couple.

23:35.329 --> 23:38.088
With all these nonsense you go on doing,
bringing it to the level

23:38.113 --> 23:41.833
of physical appearances, physical
understanding, your ego,

23:41.858 --> 23:47.434
“I want this, I want that”, you find that
just after the marriage you get off.

23:47.459 --> 23:50.486
You start analyzing. That’s why
I am telling you today.

23:50.511 --> 23:56.062
I may not able to talk to you about
marriages later on. That be careful.

23:56.087 --> 24:00.320
And that’s how you have brought
problems to Me.

24:01.603 --> 24:05.564
You see, once you accept that in Sahaja
Yoga you are going to marry,

24:05.589 --> 24:09.553
then you must accept that Sahaja Yoga
has its own norms and styles

24:09.578 --> 24:14.527
by which it will marry you and will look
after your marriage and will bless you.

24:14.552 --> 24:19.120
But if you start analyzing
and misbehaving,

24:19.145 --> 24:23.164
it’s not going to work out, and you
will have lots of problems.

24:23.189 --> 24:30.650
Either you believe in the All-pervading
Power and surrender your ego to it,

24:30.675 --> 24:35.161
or else you have your ego.

24:37.756 --> 24:42.429
Sahaja Yoga is decided by Me,
by Paramchaitanya.

24:42.454 --> 24:49.950
Now sometimes in Sahaja Yoga it may
happen that, maybe, it may not work out.

24:49.975 --> 24:58.456
But invariably I have seen, invariably,
is none of My faults. None of My faults.

24:58.481 --> 25:02.005
Mostly the leaders have given wrong
information,

25:02.030 --> 25:07.141
mostly the leaders didn’t talk about
the, about the background.

25:07.166 --> 25:17.458
Or maybe that there has been some sort
of an ego-trip with the people,

25:17.483 --> 25:21.910
and they are the ones who are creating
problems for us.

25:22.690 --> 25:27.878
But things work out. Slowly, gradually
we can improve. We must have patience.

25:27.903 --> 25:32.133
If only on first day you start demanding
something doing that,

25:32.158 --> 25:35.731
it’s not going to work out.

25:36.982 --> 25:42.635
We must learn to give, in marriage
it’s an adjustment of giving.

25:42.660 --> 25:46.979
It is no adjustment of demand.

25:47.612 --> 25:52.075
We have to give. We have to sacrifice.

25:52.100 --> 25:57.040
What is there with you to sacrifice is
all these rubbish things.

25:57.065 --> 26:01.183
Your spirit you cannot sacrifice,
so you keep to your spirit.

26:01.208 --> 26:04.896
And live with it. What is you going
to sacrifice?

26:04.921 --> 26:08.680
I mean, what do you have to give?

26:09.548 --> 26:13.515
And then only you will enjoy.

26:14.563 --> 26:22.496
Then only you will enjoy the spirit.
I am getting cool breeze from you.

26:24.271 --> 26:32.464
So I want you to be very great sahaja
yogis, very great.

26:32.489 --> 26:39.054
And you should really manifest
your powers of wisdom.

26:39.079 --> 26:42.361
Now men have ego part and women
have another side,

26:42.386 --> 26:46.559
is that they are very dull sometimes.
Extremely dull.

26:46.584 --> 26:52.541
They don’t think they have to play a very
dynamic role, while they are the shaktis.

26:52.566 --> 26:57.644
Like they will not even clap hands,
they will not even have their torches

26:57.669 --> 27:04.054
to see what’s happening. Nothing. They just
think they are just a, sort of parasites.

27:04.079 --> 27:09.379
Just coming here as wives or sisters,
or whatever it is, wearing saris.

27:09.404 --> 27:13.692
No, you have to be extremely dynamic.

27:13.717 --> 27:17.551
You must know all about Sahaja Yoga.
You must know all about chakras.

27:17.576 --> 27:22.196
You should know everything. In India,
when in the ancient times,

27:22.221 --> 27:25.817
they used to teach them about God,
religion and all that.

27:25.842 --> 27:30.560
So many great ladies we had, Gargi
and Maitreyi and all those,

27:30.585 --> 27:34.169
who were very learned women.

27:34.194 --> 27:40.004
So in no way you should be just women who
do not know anything of Sahaja Yoga.

27:40.029 --> 27:43.862
Sahaja Yoga is not only meant for men;
it’s meant for you, much more for you.

27:43.887 --> 27:49.192
Because you are shakti and I am your
Mother. So I find the women lack that.

27:49.217 --> 27:53.008
They are more worried about the saris,
the this and that, and I mean,

27:53.033 --> 27:59.260
now from the hair-dressing they have
come to saris. That’s what I feel.

28:00.542 --> 28:03.911
Well, it’s just the same.

28:06.031 --> 28:09.332
Of course sari is a very good dress.
It’s nice to wear.

28:09.357 --> 28:12.942
By that we give lot of encouragement
to our weavers in India.

28:12.967 --> 28:16.972
It’s very artistic, and good that
represents also

28:16.997 --> 28:23.140
a very lady-like feminine thing. But that
doesn’t mean you should become so feminine

28:23.165 --> 28:27.360
that you don’t understand Sahaja Yoga.

28:27.385 --> 28:34.339
I have seen women don’t know where
the centers are of the feet.

28:35.629 --> 28:40.995
Indian women know. Men do know….
Indian women know,

28:41.020 --> 28:45.787
but the Western women don’t know,
so many of them.

28:45.812 --> 28:49.120
They don’t know about chakras. They don’t
know how to raise the Kundalini.

28:49.145 --> 28:51.419
They don’t know what’s the problem is.

28:51.444 --> 28:54.940
So once you have left that life, where
you are wearing a sari,

28:54.965 --> 28:59.970
doesn’t mean now that you have become
a woman in the gosha.

28:59.995 --> 29:04.042
Gosha is the one where they have to wear
chadar; chadar, they call it.

29:04.067 --> 29:09.102
No, sari means you can also be
very dynamic.

29:09.127 --> 29:13.690
The same sari that you are wearing,
even the saris of the nine yards,

29:13.715 --> 29:17.982
we have had queens who fought
the English.

29:18.007 --> 29:22.410
You have must heard about Jhansi Ki Rani.
She was hardly of any age.

29:22.435 --> 29:27.232
She jumped from eighty feet height with
her child behind her. She was a widow.

29:27.257 --> 29:33.012
And she fought the English. Left and right.
And when she was killed,

29:33.037 --> 29:39.231
the person who was here, the Englishman,
he said, the governor,

29:39.256 --> 29:45.876
he said, “We have won the war but
the glory goes to Jhansi ki Rani.”

29:47.057 --> 29:53.318
Then we had another one, Chand-bibi,
another lady, in a ...

29:55.670 --> 30:03.072
Ahmednagar; she fought. We had
so many women like that.

30:03.097 --> 30:07.750
Tremendous type of women we had,
though they lived like women.

30:07.775 --> 30:15.019
We had Padmini, we had Noorjahan,
we had Ahilyabai, so many women.

30:15.044 --> 30:19.705
They were not manly at all.
Very woman-like.

30:19.730 --> 30:24.947
There was the last one was Shivaji’s,
Shivaji’s daughter-in-law.

30:24.972 --> 30:27.787
She was only seventeen years of age,
seventeen years.

30:27.812 --> 30:32.106
And she fought this Aurangzeb and she
is the one who defeated him.

30:32.131 --> 30:36.246
Nobody could manage this Aurangzeb
horrible fellow, she defeated him.

30:36.271 --> 30:41.624
So though, you see, the Indian women look
so docile and simple,

30:41.649 --> 30:50.150
but when it comes to their personality,
they are capable of tremendous things.

30:53.643 --> 30:59.994
So this character when you are wearing
the saris you must also know how to tie up

31:00.019 --> 31:04.277
the backside and to fight.

31:06.334 --> 31:11.898
Otherwise you have not got the Sahaj
culture in you.

31:11.923 --> 31:19.079
Either you are very dominating or you are
so docile like cabbages.

31:19.104 --> 31:26.832
You must understand that we have
to be alert, very alert.

31:26.857 --> 31:30.908
And Mother depends on us. On our own
personalities,

31:30.933 --> 31:35.302
that the way we are going to develop
ourselves, our children, our husbands,

31:35.327 --> 31:39.207
our society of Sahaja Yoga, the whole
of Vishwa Nirmal Dharma.

31:39.232 --> 31:43.824
Is the woman who makes the society.

31:44.441 --> 31:53.735
The whole universe is in the hands
of a woman who creates children.

31:54.697 --> 32:00.470
So the stupid ideas of romanticism
and all this nonsense,

32:00.495 --> 32:03.657
has to be finished. The possession
of husband –

32:03.682 --> 32:07.910
“What time you came,” “When did you go,”
“Where did you go,”

32:07.935 --> 32:11.776
and here the women when Shivaji
started his fight

32:11.801 --> 32:18.713
they used to cut their finger, thumb,
and used to put the tika

32:18.738 --> 32:21.934
on the forehead of the husbands who
were going in the war

32:21.959 --> 32:26.774
and they said, “Don’t come showing
your back”.

32:28.994 --> 32:31.813
Such great women we have had
in this Maharashtra,

32:31.838 --> 32:34.950
where you find them to be so mild.

32:34.975 --> 32:39.963
If it comes to their country, if it comes
to their own personality,

32:39.988 --> 32:46.829
to their own chastity or anything, they are
tremendous. Just like lionesses.

32:46.861 --> 32:50.723
So with this sari lots of things go
hand in hand.

32:50.748 --> 32:54.071
Is not only the sari you are wearing,
but you are representing

32:54.096 --> 32:59.482
something very dynamic within
yourself.

33:01.420 --> 33:05.999
Now when we talk about our further
programs

33:06.024 --> 33:10.470
people are insisting that we should have
a program in any case in Kolhapur.

33:10.495 --> 33:12.933
But I told them I’ll not allow sahaja yogis
to go there

33:12.958 --> 33:17.791
because they were hurt so badly. But some
of you can come, not all of you.

33:17.816 --> 33:20.969
I would be rather worried. I don’t think
anybody will hurt you

33:20.994 --> 33:23.865
and they are saying they will make
arrangements.

33:23.890 --> 33:29.968
So if you want to come, if you are
not afraid...

33:45.114 --> 33:50.537
But on one promise. That nobody is going
to beat anyone.

33:50.562 --> 33:53.879
I am saying, “Don’t beat. Don’t beat”
and somebody heard, “Beat”.

33:53.904 --> 33:58.822
I mean, I mean, I have never heard such
sort of thing, when I am saying

33:58.847 --> 34:02.193
on the thing that, “Don’t beat.
Don’t beat,”

34:02.218 --> 34:06.158
then somebody hears that, “Beat them.
Beat them”.

34:06.972 --> 34:10.586
I just don’t understand how can
(that be).

34:10.611 --> 34:16.562
So you don’t have to, really, you don’t
have to beat anyone.

34:16.587 --> 34:19.877
There is no need. You know that
there is Paramchaitanya working.

34:19.902 --> 34:24.855
All this is also the work
of Paramchaitanya. In the afternoon,

34:24.880 --> 34:28.981
Yogi Mahajan was discussing with Me
very seriously like a lawyer,

34:29.006 --> 34:33.112
saying that, “Mother we cannot form
a criminal case on them,

34:33.137 --> 34:40.826
because there is no evidence”. Afternoon.
And in the evening we have evidence now.

34:50.856 --> 34:55.343
And then they are writing in the other way
round, that they were beaten up

34:55.375 --> 34:59.985
and that you threw stones at them.
And none of them were injured.

35:00.010 --> 35:04.388
They must have been vibrated stones,
I think.

35:07.826 --> 35:13.757
How can you? They had no injuries. They
wrote it down they've no injuries.

35:13.782 --> 35:17.047
So there is no need for you to bother
about it.

35:17.072 --> 35:21.819
With all that there were at least more
than four hundred stones that came

35:21.844 --> 35:27.731
and only eighteen people got hurt. And
really seriously, I think, one or two.

35:27.756 --> 35:33.035
So there is nothing and I can cure
all of you, [you] know that very well.

35:45.268 --> 35:48.654
On the whole, you see this country,
especially Maharashtra,

35:48.679 --> 35:52.620
is so full of devotion to God.

35:52.645 --> 35:56.010
Like these things are not going to work
out. But they are very dangerous people

35:56.035 --> 36:02.171
like Hitler, you see, they start moving
about and giving some ideas and all that.

36:02.196 --> 36:06.332
So it is better to finish them at the time
when they are just prospering,

36:06.357 --> 36:11.098
as they call themselves Nirmulan,
is to remove the roots.

36:11.123 --> 36:16.344
So we have to do the Nirmulan
of Nirmulan.

36:16.369 --> 36:20.714
All right. So now today we'll have
the puja.

36:20.739 --> 36:28.797
Then after that if you want you can go
to Kolhapur for your purchase.

36:28.822 --> 36:32.638
But it starts, the shops starts quite late
and will keep quite late till eight

36:32.663 --> 36:37.708
and tomorrow the whole day is available
for you. So you can take your buses.

36:37.733 --> 36:43.118
You can go down there, and you can have
your purchase and all that,

36:43.143 --> 36:46.644
then come back here. Tomorrow also
you can do the same.

36:46.669 --> 36:52.779
Day after tomorrow, our Mr. Govind has
very kindly invited you all to his place,

36:52.804 --> 36:57.990
as it is he is an extremely generous man.
So,

37:09.095 --> 37:11.515
and when I told him that, “You must
take money from Me”,

37:11.556 --> 37:14.216
he was just fighting with Me, “Mother,
give me this first chance.

37:14.241 --> 37:19.639
This is my great honor that…(speaking
Marathi and Hindi to someone)

37:23.759 --> 37:28.667
So… Let them come, if they want to come.”

37:35.694 --> 37:39.276
So then the program is that day
after tomorrow,

37:39.301 --> 37:44.259
after this thing he says it will be over
by 12:30 or one′o clock.

37:44.284 --> 37:48.661
So you will have tonight and tomorrow
full day for your shopping.

37:48.686 --> 37:52.203
But I think then you should not bother
more about shopping.

37:52.228 --> 37:54.785
Whatever you have to do, better finish
tomorrow.

37:54.810 --> 37:57.743
And then you have to come
to the program also.

37:57.768 --> 38:01.521
Day after if you linger on then it will
be very difficult.

38:01.546 --> 38:07.396
So all of you should go there, have your
food, and then go to Ganapatipule.

38:07.421 --> 38:11.451
This is the program. So you reach
Ganapatipule in the evening.

38:11.476 --> 38:13.992
I hope it’s all clear to you.

38:14.017 --> 38:17.977
And whatever you want to buy, you have
to buy here. But I would say

38:18.002 --> 38:22.443
that some of you are really, really
do not know what is real silk is.

38:22.468 --> 38:25.500
And I've seen some people buying
something horrid.

38:25.525 --> 38:29.417
And very thin silk you should not buy
because it will last only for eight days.

38:29.442 --> 38:32.498
And then it will be finished. So don’t go
for cheap things.

38:32.523 --> 38:37.724
One sari which is good sari, silk sari,
is better than ten bad saris.

38:37.749 --> 38:42.102
Luckily now we have some saris that you
wanted for, the printed saris

38:42.127 --> 38:46.955
which I can give you in Ganapatipule.
Nice printed saris,

38:46.980 --> 38:54.135
of the tassar and also silk. We’ll have
them there. You can all buy, there.

38:55.566 --> 38:58.125
Anything else?

38:58.704 --> 39:04.633
Because I don’t think I’ll meet you any
more perhaps till we go to Ganapatipule.

39:04.658 --> 39:09.885
Now also if you could get those
bhajan things, please buy.

39:09.910 --> 39:13.736
I have given you presents twice. But you
never bring them on your tour

39:13.761 --> 39:19.306
and this time again, I don’t want to get
this kind of a thing. (Hindi).

39:19.331 --> 39:26.340
Just show them. Anything of this kind,
please get it. Is very important.

39:26.365 --> 39:31.766
I have given you twice as presents
but it’s very difficult every time

39:31.791 --> 39:37.967
to go to the shop and get it for you.
If you can get them please buy.

39:37.992 --> 39:44.181
Some of you should at least have them.
(speaking marathi to someone)

39:52.533 --> 39:56.618
He will organize, you better purchase.

40:03.298 --> 40:09.636
Now all the marriages practically have
been decided. One or two are left,

40:09.661 --> 40:14.913
which he has also adjusted. Now those who
were over age or something like that,

40:14.938 --> 40:17.508
we could not arrange their marriages.
Doesn’t matter.

40:17.533 --> 40:20.274
It may work out, it may not work out.
Doesn’t matter.

40:20.299 --> 40:24.650
After all, you are in Sahaja Yoga. I mean,
you are really married to Sahaja Yoga,

40:24.675 --> 40:29.165
that’s all. This is something sideways,
you see.

40:29.190 --> 40:32.478
So don’t make very, your life
miserable,

40:32.503 --> 40:36.000
so all the way you have come, to know
that you are not ...

40:36.025 --> 40:40.219
we have not been able to arrange
your marriage. It’s not proper.

40:40.244 --> 40:44.000
Just enjoy. Don’t miss the point.

40:44.025 --> 40:47.306
May God bless you.
