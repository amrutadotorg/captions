00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:17.761
Yesterday’s experience was that
the whole day I had to spend it

00:00:17.786 --> 00:00:23.206
with police people explaining to them.

00:00:23.231 --> 00:00:30.805
And now I feel that in Maharashtra,
there is a rule of Mafia.

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:38.952
And that it is for us to face it
and we have to prove it.

00:00:38.977 --> 00:00:42.270
I am sorry some people were hurt
so badly

00:00:42.295 --> 00:00:45.160
and I'll think after Puja they’ll take
you to the hospital.

00:00:45.185 --> 00:00:50.831
Here there is a very nice hospital where
we have very good doctors.

00:00:50.856 --> 00:01:04.950
And then I would request you
to know that,

00:01:05.805 --> 00:01:14.868
the evil and the good, always has
to struggle and fight.

00:01:14.893 --> 00:01:24.226
Formerly in this great country of
Maharashtra all the saints were tortured,

00:01:24.251 --> 00:01:31.531
to such an extent that it is amazing
how despite all that

00:01:31.555 --> 00:01:38.773
they kept the banner of spirituality
so high.

00:01:38.798 --> 00:01:48.945
They are still existing, the same people,

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.428
who have tortured the saints and I think
they are the same people

00:01:53.453 --> 00:02:00.653
who have behaved in such a bad manner
towards you all.

00:02:01.948 --> 00:02:10.219
This kind of ego-trip builds up
in everyone

00:02:10.244 --> 00:02:14.265
– even in among sahaja yogis, it does
build up.

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:20.777
And they are all the time
on a different scene.

00:02:20.802 --> 00:02:30.072
This is like Hitler's style of behavior
that you pick up some sort of an issue.

00:02:30.097 --> 00:02:33.388
An issue could be anything, like they
are saying that

00:02:33.413 --> 00:02:36.410
“we are trying to remove all the blind
faiths”. I mean,

00:02:36.435 --> 00:02:41.795
I've done this for eighteen years,
what can they do more than that?

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.227
And I have removed all your blind faiths
in all kinds of stupid things

00:02:45.252 --> 00:02:48.799
that the religion, so-called, was teaching
you.

00:02:48.824 --> 00:02:53.082
In every religion, there is no question
of only Hindu religion.

00:02:53.107 --> 00:02:55.708
But here they dare not say anything
about the Muslims

00:02:55.733 --> 00:02:58.540
because the Hindus are very mild people.

00:02:58.565 --> 00:03:02.386
They (the muslims) want that
all the temples must be removed,

00:03:02.411 --> 00:03:06.243
all the deities must be thrown away.

00:03:06.268 --> 00:03:12.490
This is all I think Rajneesh is their guru
because he made a...

00:03:13.877 --> 00:03:23.830
he made an exhibition where he tried
to show

00:03:23.855 --> 00:03:28.002
that Ganapati was something very funny
and all that.

00:03:28.027 --> 00:03:30.732
Now medically you know in Sahaja Yoga,

00:03:30.732 --> 00:03:35.975
that without Ganesha we cannot cure
many diseases. Is a fact.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.158
So a stupid fellow talking like that,
has become now the guru of these people

00:03:40.183 --> 00:03:43.731
who are discarded all over the world
and who have been insulted.

00:03:43.756 --> 00:03:48.936
So these few newspapers have made
him as a guru, perhaps that

00:03:48.961 --> 00:03:53.290
they are following his methods of saying
that we should be,

00:03:53.315 --> 00:03:56.793
we should be rid of all these ideas
and this and that.

00:03:56.818 --> 00:04:04.210
But they have gone to the extent that
all the spirituality is an illusion.

00:04:05.575 --> 00:04:09.790
It's such a joke. And that we should
give up

00:04:09.815 --> 00:04:16.611
all the, all readings and all understanding
about spirituality.

00:04:16.611 --> 00:04:21.173
But they do not know that their heritage
is spirituality.

00:04:21.198 --> 00:04:24.636
And the whole world depends on that.

00:04:24.661 --> 00:04:29.129
The whole world, because when the people
took to industrial development,

00:04:29.154 --> 00:04:32.304
you know how far they have gone
and how much they are lost.

00:04:32.329 --> 00:04:36.142
And how far you were in that mess.
And how you came back

00:04:36.167 --> 00:04:38.924
because of Sahaja Yoga’s spirituality.

00:04:38.964 --> 00:04:46.732
Now if this nourishment from the roots
of spirituality

00:04:46.757 --> 00:04:51.591
does not reach the West, the real
knowledge, as it is in Sahaja Yoga,

00:04:51.616 --> 00:04:56.405
the West will be finished. West will be
finished, you know that very well.

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:00.934
There is no joy, there is no love,
there is no poetry,

00:05:00.959 --> 00:05:05.230
there is no music, there is no culture.

00:05:07.025 --> 00:05:13.210
But as you have understood that now
these people have now started

00:05:13.235 --> 00:05:16.126
talking about “no religion”
“no religion”,

00:05:16.151 --> 00:05:19.259
like many of your western countries
have also done,

00:05:19.284 --> 00:05:21.762
specially Russia has done that way,

00:05:21.787 --> 00:05:24.706
that there is nothing like God,
there is nothing like this and that.

00:05:24.731 --> 00:05:28.745
And now after all that now they
are coming to God.

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:32.139
So now we’ll have to go through
another circle.

00:05:32.164 --> 00:05:35.734
But they are only hardly twenty people.

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:42.172
So even one fellow who is like Hitler,
can destroy the whole thing.

00:05:42.197 --> 00:05:48.546
This is a very important thing - to destroy
something you need only one person.

00:05:48.571 --> 00:05:56.814
But to sustain and to construct
you need many people.

00:05:56.839 --> 00:06:03.904
To drown a ship, you need only
one hole in it.

00:06:03.929 --> 00:06:10.075
But to build the ship, you take months
together.

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:14.257
So the work that is done for these
last eighteen years

00:06:14.282 --> 00:06:17.965
of Sahaja Yoga, is really tremendous.

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:21.165
And the truth about it, you know
for definite,

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:26.252
that it has helped so many people. Though
we have been going from ups and downs

00:06:26.277 --> 00:06:29.874
and all that, we've been doing wrong
things, no doubt about it,

00:06:29.899 --> 00:06:36.353
but still, now we are quite established
and we know what Sahaja Yoga is.

00:06:36.378 --> 00:06:43.564
The experience of Sahaja Yoga you all
have had. We have seen so many,

00:06:43.589 --> 00:06:47.590
(towards someone…) “What is she doing?
Please be seated”.

00:06:48.521 --> 00:06:53.096
Miraculous photographs you have seen,
so many miracles in your life day to day.

00:06:53.121 --> 00:06:58.319
Every day there are miracles. Now to say
there is no God

00:06:58.344 --> 00:07:02.285
is impossible for you because you have
felt the miracles

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:06.669
of this All-pervading Power,
the Paramchaitanya.

00:07:06.694 --> 00:07:10.115
And also all the religions are explained

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:15.650
and the complete integration of them
has been brought in.

00:07:15.675 --> 00:07:21.113
But for that we have to know, as I told
you in Brahmapuri,

00:07:21.138 --> 00:07:25.586
that the sahaja yogis have to know that
they have to become dynamic.

00:07:25.611 --> 00:07:32.698
Whatever energies you have got, whatever
you have achieved within yourselves,

00:07:32.723 --> 00:07:37.798
is not sufficient enough. You have
to manifest.

00:07:37.823 --> 00:07:42.185
And in that dynamism, I think people
get lost.

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:45.538
I have seen that some leaders become
horrid.

00:07:45.563 --> 00:07:50.348
I mean, sometimes their Vishuddhis could
be horrible, then their heart goes out.

00:07:50.384 --> 00:07:57.563
So you should not allow anybody (to be)
a leader for more than one month.

00:07:57.588 --> 00:08:02.765
It goes off. I have seen it. Because your
balloon has been already bloated

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:08.441
and again it gets re-bloated in no time.
(speaking in Marathi…).

00:08:11.812 --> 00:08:18.546
They have religiously kept all the Indians
outside, I think. (speaking in Marathi…).

00:08:21.327 --> 00:08:24.477
I mean, he is the organizer here.

00:08:26.536 --> 00:08:29.803
(speaking Marathi)

00:08:32.358 --> 00:08:37.800
So the heritage of our country is
spirituality.

00:08:40.179 --> 00:08:44.340
And this is the nourishment.

00:08:44.365 --> 00:08:53.619
Only the one-sided growth in the West, due
to machinery or whatever you may call it,

00:08:54.487 --> 00:08:58.413
has ruined it completely.

00:08:58.438 --> 00:09:01.705
And one-sided growth in this country,
and all such countries,

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:08.938
where religion has become a blind faith,
has also ruined it.

00:09:08.963 --> 00:09:13.726
But in the center lies Sahaja Yoga.

00:09:13.751 --> 00:09:20.821
Now your wisdom, your sense,
is so apparent.

00:09:20.846 --> 00:09:26.597
I mean, people have been to all kinds
of gurus here and have been to everyone,

00:09:26.622 --> 00:09:31.068
but they don’t know anything about
anything. Except for remembering by heart

00:09:31.093 --> 00:09:35.464
- some these Hare Ramas, talk about,
“Rama” “Rama” – like that.

00:09:35.489 --> 00:09:38.419
While you know everything about Kundalini.
You know how to raise it.

00:09:38.444 --> 00:09:41.799
You know how to give Realization. You know
what are the diseases are caused,

00:09:41.824 --> 00:09:45.916
how to cure it and everything and
everything and everything.

00:09:45.941 --> 00:09:52.003
I mean, it has come to such a stage
that nobody asks Me any questions.

00:09:54.381 --> 00:09:58.094
Otherwise, in the beginning in London,
My lecture was for five minutes

00:09:58.119 --> 00:10:03.651
and the questions were for the rest
of the time.

00:10:03.676 --> 00:10:08.282
So now you know so much.

00:10:10.731 --> 00:10:17.086
And you accept which cannot be explained
also, because you know that.

00:10:17.111 --> 00:10:22.164
For example, somebody will ask Me,
“Mother, how do you get these photographs?”

00:10:22.189 --> 00:10:25.763
Why are we talking about it?

00:10:25.788 --> 00:10:32.410
I know how it happens, who is doing
this trick. But I don’t want to tell you.

00:10:35.606 --> 00:10:37.760
Moreover, if you demand something,
I’ll never tell you.

00:10:37.785 --> 00:10:39.997
That’s one of the characters I have.

00:10:40.022 --> 00:10:45.045
Ah, if you come with humble thing
and honest desire to know,

00:10:45.070 --> 00:10:47.974
then I can tell you about everything,
that you want to know.

00:10:47.999 --> 00:10:50.991
But if you just want to force Me and say
that, “I challenge you”,

00:10:51.016 --> 00:10:53.909
I said, “I also challenge you.
Get out of here”.

00:10:53.934 --> 00:10:57.075
Like that. You see, it doesn’t react,
that way.

00:10:57.100 --> 00:11:03.328
So it is just the temperament
of the Divine

00:11:03.368 --> 00:11:10.292
that if you are convex, the Divine
becomes convex also,

00:11:10.317 --> 00:11:15.634
and fights and says, “No, get out”.
If you become concave,

00:11:15.659 --> 00:11:24.194
then it emits and gives knowledge,
or receives knowledge.

00:11:24.219 --> 00:11:30.185
So one has to be humble. That’s very
important part of it. One has to be humble.

00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:38.465
So the awareness, again I talk about
awareness,

00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:43.537
within you should be that, how much
we have come to know about ourselves.

00:11:43.562 --> 00:11:47.016
How much we have to come to know
about others?

00:11:47.041 --> 00:11:54.635
How much we know about our own being?
How much we know about chakras?

00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:58.501
In such a short time, how did we come
to know about it?

00:11:58.526 --> 00:12:02.550
Like we should know, if you are dealing
with a computer,

00:12:02.575 --> 00:12:09.809
and you know how computer works, how
it acts, how it is programmed, everything

00:12:09.834 --> 00:12:15.749
without programming it, without working
it out, without building it up.

00:12:15.774 --> 00:12:19.026
I mean, if you build it up, you know
how it works. But without doing that

00:12:19.051 --> 00:12:23.098
just to know a computer how it works,
and all the machinery about it,

00:12:23.123 --> 00:12:26.722
is a tremendous knowledge.

00:12:26.747 --> 00:12:30.399
And this is what has to be there
for all of us

00:12:30.424 --> 00:12:34.595
to know what we are there as human beings,
and what we have to do

00:12:34.722 --> 00:12:39.685
to emancipate the other human beings.

00:12:40.275 --> 00:12:44.700
Of course, I shouldn’t say that every
sahaja yogi is of that level, no.

00:12:44.725 --> 00:12:50.037
Or comes up, but everybody is trying.
Nobody has denied Sahaja Yoga.

00:12:50.062 --> 00:12:54.423
Nobody has said it’s not true. Everybody
is trying to get

00:12:54.448 --> 00:13:00.824
higher and higher in his state
of spirituality which doesn’t speak.

00:13:00.849 --> 00:13:07.447
It acts. It doesn’t manipulate. It acts.

00:13:07.472 --> 00:13:11.896
And we've seen it acts in so many
miraculous ways.

00:13:11.921 --> 00:13:17.514
So first to know about all these things,
after feeling that Paramchaitanya,

00:13:17.539 --> 00:13:21.791
is different from just to talk about it.

00:13:21.816 --> 00:13:25.897
Many have talked about it, but you have
never felt it.

00:13:25.922 --> 00:13:30.826
Now you have felt it, you have verified it,
you have experimented it.

00:13:30.851 --> 00:13:36.277
And you have found it that, this is
something absolutely real.

00:13:36.302 --> 00:13:44.741
In science, as Dr. Khan was telling Me,
that in science,

00:13:44.766 --> 00:13:51.415
the one theory which is established today
might be refuted tomorrow.

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:55.953
Another theory that is established,
may be refuted.

00:13:55.978 --> 00:14:00.181
It goes on. So that no theory is
an absolute theory.

00:14:00.206 --> 00:14:04.979
But in Sahaja Yoga for the last eighteen
years, whatever I have been saying

00:14:05.004 --> 00:14:11.240
is the truth. And is absolute. It cannot
be challenged again.

00:14:11.265 --> 00:14:14.619
Nobody can say, “No, Mother,
it is not so”.

00:14:14.644 --> 00:14:20.073
A simple thing is, somebody comes to you
and you say, the other day it happened,

00:14:20.098 --> 00:14:26.561
one doctor was there in Aurangabad,
and he said that,

00:14:29.876 --> 00:14:35.103
“I have never had any guru”. But his left
Swadhistana…

00:14:35.128 --> 00:14:38.652
and he was looking very disturbed. He was
a sahaja yogi in a way,

00:14:38.677 --> 00:14:43.385
not looking normal. “I have pain
in the stomach,” and this and that.

00:14:43.410 --> 00:14:48.858
I asked him, “You had no guru?”,
he said, “No”. (speaking Marathi).

00:16:02.864 --> 00:16:07.984
So now as science has progressed
we can see clearly

00:16:08.009 --> 00:16:13.076
that it has not got the theory
which is absolute.

00:16:13.101 --> 00:16:18.953
But in Sahaja Yoga, as I told you,
there was a gentleman, a doctor,

00:16:18.978 --> 00:16:22.403
who was denying, he said, “I had no guru”.
I asked him, “Do you read books?”,

00:16:22.428 --> 00:16:28.693
“Yes – he said - I read Vivekananda”.
I said, “That’s it”.

00:16:28.718 --> 00:16:32.425
He said he was reading the book
of a particular guru.

00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:37.935
We gave a bandhan to that guru
and this fellow felt alright.

00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:44.649
There are so many things one has to know
about.

00:16:44.674 --> 00:16:52.359
Little, little things are there, which must
be understood in Sahaja Yoga.

00:16:52.384 --> 00:16:59.039
And one should do it according to them,
because it is for your benevolence.

00:16:59.064 --> 00:17:06.832
Now supposing I say, “Just do these
things”. If you don’t accept Me,

00:17:06.857 --> 00:17:10.509
why am I telling you? I am not telling you
because I have to gain anything.

00:17:10.534 --> 00:17:15.857
But is for your good. Now if you don’t
want to accept me or if you react,

00:17:15.882 --> 00:17:19.865
is not going to help you. Sahaja Yoga
is not for Me, is for you.

00:17:19.890 --> 00:17:24.094
Now if you are, truthfully, honestly,
if you are seekers,

00:17:24.119 --> 00:17:29.334
then you must know that "My aim
is to rise spiritually".

00:17:29.359 --> 00:17:32.035
Now in science you have risen quite a lot,
you are fed up with it.

00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:35.054
Now you’re back into spirituality

00:17:35.079 --> 00:17:38.827
and for spirituality you have to be
a subtler person.

00:17:38.853 --> 00:17:43.199
And for these subtleties you have
to give up all your conditionings.

00:17:43.224 --> 00:17:47.157
All funny conditionings are to be given
and the worst that you have,

00:17:47.182 --> 00:17:53.212
is the ego part. It just jumps up. I have
seen that appointing people leaders

00:17:53.245 --> 00:17:58.210
has been the greatest harmful thing
I have done to them.

00:17:58.235 --> 00:18:02.459
So many of them just got lost, because
they became leaders.

00:18:02.484 --> 00:18:07.428
I mean, a kind of a Hitler, enters
into them.

00:18:07.453 --> 00:18:10.677
So this is one of the worst conditionings
we have.

00:18:10.702 --> 00:18:17.369
We have to be very careful that we don’t
try to assert our ego on others.

00:18:17.394 --> 00:18:20.863
When we become leaders or a some position
is given to us,

00:18:20.888 --> 00:18:29.970
or ask something is to be achieved
through your authority.

00:18:29.995 --> 00:18:32.837
Only we have the authority of God.

00:18:32.862 --> 00:18:39.265
Unless and until we become humble
like that, nothing is going to flow.

00:18:39.290 --> 00:18:46.193
You can see that, that the sea lies
the lowest in height.

00:18:46.218 --> 00:18:50.336
And all the rivers and everything flows
to the sea.

00:18:50.361 --> 00:18:54.809
And from the sea only rises the rain.

00:18:54.834 --> 00:19:00.373
Supposing sea was somewhere on top
of Himalayas,

00:19:00.398 --> 00:19:10.843
we would have been all living
in the Sahara desert.

00:19:11.649 --> 00:19:17.525
Is a very simple thing, is to be humble
- that’s first sign - is to be humble,

00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:26.492
is to be non-violent, because we depend
on the All-pervading Power.

00:19:26.517 --> 00:19:31.498
It is a power which is completely
integrated within us.

00:19:31.523 --> 00:19:38.065
Only we are not the ones, we want
to be aware of it.

00:19:38.745 --> 00:19:43.508
So this ignorance, this blindness,
if it disappears from us,

00:19:43.541 --> 00:19:48.654
that Divine Power will manifest.

00:19:48.679 --> 00:19:53.891
But our styles are so complicated.

00:19:53.916 --> 00:19:57.645
Sometimes I just don’t understand,

00:19:58.243 --> 00:20:03.808
why we have complicated ourselves
so much.

00:20:03.833 --> 00:20:10.430
I mean, look at the flowers, look at
the leaves; they are on a tree, supposing.

00:20:10.455 --> 00:20:16.709
Automatically they will open out
to the sun. Automatically.

00:20:16.734 --> 00:20:20.147
You don’t have to take a leaf towards
the sun, not at all.

00:20:20.172 --> 00:20:22.951
Automatically it opens out. You have
seen it every day.

00:20:22.976 --> 00:20:26.209
Automatically. Because it requires sun.

00:20:26.234 --> 00:20:32.446
Now you want to have spirit in yourself.
You want to get to spirit.

00:20:32.471 --> 00:20:37.632
So automatically you should, really
automatically, if that is your desire,

00:20:37.657 --> 00:20:45.672
you should, with your own desire only,
should get to the light of the spirit.

00:20:45.697 --> 00:20:53.419
And should grow in that spirit to know
that this is what you have to achieve.

00:20:55.905 --> 00:20:59.409
But small things disturb you,

00:20:59.434 --> 00:21:03.791
like somebody doesn’t get married. Next
day you see the face of that person,

00:21:03.816 --> 00:21:08.913
as if somebody has died in the family
he is sitting there.

00:21:08.941 --> 00:21:15.956
Really, I have seen it. Immediately I make
out who has not been yet engaged.

00:21:18.277 --> 00:21:22.932
Then after marriage I find again
the same sort of nonsense.

00:21:22.957 --> 00:21:28.284
Because they are analyzing, “I want
this kind, I want that kind. I want”.

00:21:28.309 --> 00:21:33.515
I mean, whatever is available here
is available.

00:21:37.709 --> 00:21:43.663
Like on the ship, you don’t have any
problems, because you have no solutions.

00:21:43.688 --> 00:21:46.106
If you are moving on a ship and you
just ask for something,

00:21:46.131 --> 00:21:50.346
“Oh no, not available here,” finished.

00:21:53.985 --> 00:21:58.324
But then you lose all the fun of Sahaja
Yoga for a small little nonsensical thing.

00:21:58.349 --> 00:22:03.985
If not this, next year. What is
so important?

00:22:04.010 --> 00:22:10.437
I mean, certain there are limitations
of age, height, this, that.

00:22:10.462 --> 00:22:15.285
Then even if you arrange their marriages,
is very interesting,

00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:18.140
then they come and tell you, “No, no,
I would not like to marry this girl”.

00:22:18.165 --> 00:22:21.138
Why? “Because I want such and such”.
All right, then we find.

00:22:21.163 --> 00:22:24.075
“No, no, no, she is no good. She has
these things,” so move that.

00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:28.663
I mean this is not the way. You are not
here to choose a girl for yourself.

00:22:28.688 --> 00:22:32.511
Then there is another one who can say,
“All right, I came down, I saw one girl

00:22:32.536 --> 00:22:39.449
and fell in love”. So you fall in love
and get out. This nonsense going on.

00:22:39.474 --> 00:22:46.282
See, you must have certain amount
of dignity. You are all sahaja yogis.

00:22:46.314 --> 00:22:49.384
And when I see all this kind
of stupid attitude,

00:22:49.409 --> 00:22:54.824
I say these people can never gain
in Sahaja Yoga.

00:22:55.789 --> 00:23:01.513
In India you will be surprised. I mean,

00:23:02.251 --> 00:23:07.033
even I was married to a man who was
from another, another place.

00:23:07.058 --> 00:23:11.732
Absolutely different country, different
religion, different everything.

00:23:11.757 --> 00:23:13.890
And a different person.

00:23:13.915 --> 00:23:18.348
So one can say that it was a very
unconventional marriage, one can say.

00:23:18.373 --> 00:23:24.251
But I would never touch this man
or he would never touch me.

00:23:24.276 --> 00:23:28.943
And if he would talk to me,
in the presence of others only.

00:23:30.264 --> 00:23:35.304
And despite that, our marriage is very
strong and we are very happy couple.

00:23:35.329 --> 00:23:38.088
With all these nonsense you go on doing,
bringing it to the level

00:23:38.113 --> 00:23:41.833
of physical appearances, physical
understanding, your ego,

00:23:41.858 --> 00:23:47.434
“I want this, I want that”, you find that
just after the marriage you get off.

00:23:47.459 --> 00:23:50.486
You start analyzing. That’s why
I am telling you today.

00:23:50.511 --> 00:23:56.062
I may not able to talk to you about
marriages later on. That be careful.

00:23:56.087 --> 00:24:00.320
And that’s how you have brought
problems to Me.

00:24:01.603 --> 00:24:05.564
You see, once you accept that in Sahaja
Yoga you are going to marry,

00:24:05.589 --> 00:24:09.553
then you must accept that Sahaja Yoga
has its own norms and styles

00:24:09.578 --> 00:24:14.527
by which it will marry you and will look
after your marriage and will bless you.

00:24:14.552 --> 00:24:19.120
But if you start analyzing
and misbehaving,

00:24:19.145 --> 00:24:23.164
it’s not going to work out, and you
will have lots of problems.

00:24:23.189 --> 00:24:30.650
Either you believe in the All-pervading
Power and surrender your ego to it,

00:24:30.675 --> 00:24:35.161
or else you have your ego.

00:24:37.756 --> 00:24:42.429
Sahaja Yoga is decided by Me,
by Paramchaitanya.

00:24:42.454 --> 00:24:49.950
Now sometimes in Sahaja Yoga it may
happen that, maybe, it may not work out.

00:24:49.975 --> 00:24:58.456
But invariably I have seen, invariably,
is none of My faults. None of My faults.

00:24:58.481 --> 00:25:02.005
Mostly the leaders have given wrong
information,

00:25:02.030 --> 00:25:07.141
mostly the leaders didn’t talk about
the, about the background.

00:25:07.166 --> 00:25:17.458
Or maybe that there has been some sort
of an ego-trip with the people,

00:25:17.483 --> 00:25:21.910
and they are the ones who are creating
problems for us.

00:25:22.690 --> 00:25:27.878
But things work out. Slowly, gradually
we can improve. We must have patience.

00:25:27.903 --> 00:25:32.133
If only on first day you start demanding
something doing that,

00:25:32.158 --> 00:25:35.731
it’s not going to work out.

00:25:36.982 --> 00:25:42.635
We must learn to give, in marriage
it’s an adjustment of giving.

00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:46.979
It is no adjustment of demand.

00:25:47.612 --> 00:25:52.075
We have to give. We have to sacrifice.

00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:57.040
What is there with you to sacrifice is
all these rubbish things.

00:25:57.065 --> 00:26:01.183
Your spirit you cannot sacrifice,
so you keep to your spirit.

00:26:01.208 --> 00:26:04.896
And live with it. What is you going
to sacrifice?

00:26:04.921 --> 00:26:08.680
I mean, what do you have to give?

00:26:09.548 --> 00:26:13.515
And then only you will enjoy.

00:26:14.563 --> 00:26:22.496
Then only you will enjoy the spirit.
I am getting cool breeze from you.

00:26:24.271 --> 00:26:32.464
So I want you to be very great sahaja
yogis, very great.

00:26:32.489 --> 00:26:39.054
And you should really manifest
your powers of wisdom.

00:26:39.079 --> 00:26:42.361
Now men have ego part and women
have another side,

00:26:42.386 --> 00:26:46.559
is that they are very dull sometimes.
Extremely dull.

00:26:46.584 --> 00:26:52.541
They don’t think they have to play a very
dynamic role, while they are the shaktis.

00:26:52.566 --> 00:26:57.644
Like they will not even clap hands,
they will not even have their torches

00:26:57.669 --> 00:27:04.054
to see what’s happening. Nothing. They just
think they are just a, sort of parasites.

00:27:04.079 --> 00:27:09.379
Just coming here as wives or sisters,
or whatever it is, wearing saris.

00:27:09.404 --> 00:27:13.692
No, you have to be extremely dynamic.

00:27:13.717 --> 00:27:17.551
You must know all about Sahaja Yoga.
You must know all about chakras.

00:27:17.576 --> 00:27:22.196
You should know everything. In India,
when in the ancient times,

00:27:22.221 --> 00:27:25.817
they used to teach them about God,
religion and all that.

00:27:25.842 --> 00:27:30.560
So many great ladies we had, Gargi
and Maitreyi and all those,

00:27:30.585 --> 00:27:34.169
who were very learned women.

00:27:34.194 --> 00:27:40.004
So in no way you should be just women who
do not know anything of Sahaja Yoga.

00:27:40.029 --> 00:27:43.862
Sahaja Yoga is not only meant for men;
it’s meant for you, much more for you.

00:27:43.887 --> 00:27:49.192
Because you are shakti and I am your
Mother. So I find the women lack that.

00:27:49.217 --> 00:27:53.008
They are more worried about the saris,
the this and that, and I mean,

00:27:53.033 --> 00:27:59.260
now from the hair-dressing they have
come to saris. That’s what I feel.

00:28:00.542 --> 00:28:03.911
Well, it’s just the same.

00:28:06.031 --> 00:28:09.332
Of course sari is a very good dress.
It’s nice to wear.

00:28:09.357 --> 00:28:12.942
By that we give lot of encouragement
to our weavers in India.

00:28:12.967 --> 00:28:16.972
It’s very artistic, and good that
represents also

00:28:16.997 --> 00:28:23.140
a very lady-like feminine thing. But that
doesn’t mean you should become so feminine

00:28:23.165 --> 00:28:27.360
that you don’t understand Sahaja Yoga.

00:28:27.385 --> 00:28:34.339
I have seen women don’t know where
the centers are of the feet.

00:28:35.629 --> 00:28:40.995
Indian women know. Men do know….
Indian women know,

00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:45.787
but the Western women don’t know,
so many of them.

00:28:45.812 --> 00:28:49.120
They don’t know about chakras. They don’t
know how to raise the Kundalini.

00:28:49.145 --> 00:28:51.419
They don’t know what’s the problem is.

00:28:51.444 --> 00:28:54.940
So once you have left that life, where
you are wearing a sari,

00:28:54.965 --> 00:28:59.970
doesn’t mean now that you have become
a woman in the gosha.

00:28:59.995 --> 00:29:04.042
Gosha is the one where they have to wear
chadar; chadar, they call it.

00:29:04.067 --> 00:29:09.102
No, sari means you can also be
very dynamic.

00:29:09.127 --> 00:29:13.690
The same sari that you are wearing,
even the saris of the nine yards,

00:29:13.715 --> 00:29:17.982
we have had queens who fought
the English.

00:29:18.007 --> 00:29:22.410
You have must heard about Jhansi Ki Rani.
She was hardly of any age.

00:29:22.435 --> 00:29:27.232
She jumped from eighty feet height with
her child behind her. She was a widow.

00:29:27.257 --> 00:29:33.012
And she fought the English. Left and right.
And when she was killed,

00:29:33.037 --> 00:29:39.231
the person who was here, the Englishman,
he said, the governor,

00:29:39.256 --> 00:29:45.876
he said, “We have won the war but
the glory goes to Jhansi ki Rani.”

00:29:47.057 --> 00:29:53.318
Then we had another one, Chand-bibi,
another lady, in a ...

00:29:55.670 --> 00:30:03.072
Ahmednagar; she fought. We had
so many women like that.

00:30:03.097 --> 00:30:07.750
Tremendous type of women we had,
though they lived like women.

00:30:07.775 --> 00:30:15.019
We had Padmini, we had Noorjahan,
we had Ahilyabai, so many women.

00:30:15.044 --> 00:30:19.705
They were not manly at all.
Very woman-like.

00:30:19.730 --> 00:30:24.947
There was the last one was Shivaji’s,
Shivaji’s daughter-in-law.

00:30:24.972 --> 00:30:27.787
She was only seventeen years of age,
seventeen years.

00:30:27.812 --> 00:30:32.106
And she fought this Aurangzeb and she
is the one who defeated him.

00:30:32.131 --> 00:30:36.246
Nobody could manage this Aurangzeb
horrible fellow, she defeated him.

00:30:36.271 --> 00:30:41.624
So though, you see, the Indian women look
so docile and simple,

00:30:41.649 --> 00:30:50.150
but when it comes to their personality,
they are capable of tremendous things.

00:30:53.643 --> 00:30:59.994
So this character when you are wearing
the saris you must also know how to tie up

00:31:00.019 --> 00:31:04.277
the backside and to fight.

00:31:06.334 --> 00:31:11.898
Otherwise you have not got the Sahaj
culture in you.

00:31:11.923 --> 00:31:19.079
Either you are very dominating or you are
so docile like cabbages.

00:31:19.104 --> 00:31:26.832
You must understand that we have
to be alert, very alert.

00:31:26.857 --> 00:31:30.908
And Mother depends on us. On our own
personalities,

00:31:30.933 --> 00:31:35.302
that the way we are going to develop
ourselves, our children, our husbands,

00:31:35.327 --> 00:31:39.207
our society of Sahaja Yoga, the whole
of Vishwa Nirmal Dharma.

00:31:39.232 --> 00:31:43.824
Is the woman who makes the society.

00:31:44.441 --> 00:31:53.735
The whole universe is in the hands
of a woman who creates children.

00:31:54.697 --> 00:32:00.470
So the stupid ideas of romanticism
and all this nonsense,

00:32:00.495 --> 00:32:03.657
has to be finished. The possession
of husband –

00:32:03.682 --> 00:32:07.910
“What time you came,” “When did you go,”
“Where did you go,”

00:32:07.935 --> 00:32:11.776
and here the women when Shivaji
started his fight

00:32:11.801 --> 00:32:18.713
they used to cut their finger, thumb,
and used to put the tika

00:32:18.738 --> 00:32:21.934
on the forehead of the husbands who
were going in the war

00:32:21.959 --> 00:32:26.774
and they said, “Don’t come showing
your back”.

00:32:28.994 --> 00:32:31.813
Such great women we have had
in this Maharashtra,

00:32:31.838 --> 00:32:34.950
where you find them to be so mild.

00:32:34.975 --> 00:32:39.963
If it comes to their country, if it comes
to their own personality,

00:32:39.988 --> 00:32:46.829
to their own chastity or anything, they are
tremendous. Just like lionesses.

00:32:46.861 --> 00:32:50.723
So with this sari lots of things go
hand in hand.

00:32:50.748 --> 00:32:54.071
Is not only the sari you are wearing,
but you are representing

00:32:54.096 --> 00:32:59.482
something very dynamic within
yourself.

00:33:01.420 --> 00:33:05.999
Now when we talk about our further
programs

00:33:06.024 --> 00:33:10.470
people are insisting that we should have
a program in any case in Kolhapur.

00:33:10.495 --> 00:33:12.933
But I told them I’ll not allow sahaja yogis
to go there

00:33:12.958 --> 00:33:17.791
because they were hurt so badly. But some
of you can come, not all of you.

00:33:17.816 --> 00:33:20.969
I would be rather worried. I don’t think
anybody will hurt you

00:33:20.994 --> 00:33:23.865
and they are saying they will make
arrangements.

00:33:23.890 --> 00:33:29.968
So if you want to come, if you are
not afraid...

00:33:45.114 --> 00:33:50.537
But on one promise. That nobody is going
to beat anyone.

00:33:50.562 --> 00:33:53.879
I am saying, “Don’t beat. Don’t beat”
and somebody heard, “Beat”.

00:33:53.904 --> 00:33:58.822
I mean, I mean, I have never heard such
sort of thing, when I am saying

00:33:58.847 --> 00:34:02.193
on the thing that, “Don’t beat.
Don’t beat,”

00:34:02.218 --> 00:34:06.158
then somebody hears that, “Beat them.
Beat them”.

00:34:06.972 --> 00:34:10.586
I just don’t understand how can
(that be).

00:34:10.611 --> 00:34:16.562
So you don’t have to, really, you don’t
have to beat anyone.

00:34:16.587 --> 00:34:19.877
There is no need. You know that
there is Paramchaitanya working.

00:34:19.902 --> 00:34:24.855
All this is also the work
of Paramchaitanya. In the afternoon,

00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:28.981
Yogi Mahajan was discussing with Me
very seriously like a lawyer,

00:34:29.006 --> 00:34:33.112
saying that, “Mother we cannot form
a criminal case on them,

00:34:33.137 --> 00:34:40.826
because there is no evidence”. Afternoon.
And in the evening we have evidence now.

00:34:50.856 --> 00:34:55.343
And then they are writing in the other way
round, that they were beaten up

00:34:55.375 --> 00:34:59.985
and that you threw stones at them.
And none of them were injured.

00:35:00.010 --> 00:35:04.388
They must have been vibrated stones,
I think.

00:35:07.826 --> 00:35:13.757
How can you? They had no injuries. They
wrote it down they've no injuries.

00:35:13.782 --> 00:35:17.047
So there is no need for you to bother
about it.

00:35:17.072 --> 00:35:21.819
With all that there were at least more
than four hundred stones that came

00:35:21.844 --> 00:35:27.731
and only eighteen people got hurt. And
really seriously, I think, one or two.

00:35:27.756 --> 00:35:33.035
So there is nothing and I can cure
all of you, [you] know that very well.

00:35:45.268 --> 00:35:48.654
On the whole, you see this country,
especially Maharashtra,

00:35:48.679 --> 00:35:52.620
is so full of devotion to God.

00:35:52.645 --> 00:35:56.010
Like these things are not going to work
out. But they are very dangerous people

00:35:56.035 --> 00:36:02.171
like Hitler, you see, they start moving
about and giving some ideas and all that.

00:36:02.196 --> 00:36:06.332
So it is better to finish them at the time
when they are just prospering,

00:36:06.357 --> 00:36:11.098
as they call themselves Nirmulan,
is to remove the roots.

00:36:11.123 --> 00:36:16.344
So we have to do the Nirmulan
of Nirmulan.

00:36:16.369 --> 00:36:20.714
All right. So now today we'll have
the puja.

00:36:20.739 --> 00:36:28.797
Then after that if you want you can go
to Kolhapur for your purchase.

00:36:28.822 --> 00:36:32.638
But it starts, the shops starts quite late
and will keep quite late till eight

00:36:32.663 --> 00:36:37.708
and tomorrow the whole day is available
for you. So you can take your buses.

00:36:37.733 --> 00:36:43.118
You can go down there, and you can have
your purchase and all that,

00:36:43.143 --> 00:36:46.644
then come back here. Tomorrow also
you can do the same.

00:36:46.669 --> 00:36:52.779
Day after tomorrow, our Mr. Govind has
very kindly invited you all to his place,

00:36:52.804 --> 00:36:57.990
as it is he is an extremely generous man.
So,

00:37:09.095 --> 00:37:11.515
and when I told him that, “You must
take money from Me”,

00:37:11.556 --> 00:37:14.216
he was just fighting with Me, “Mother,
give me this first chance.

00:37:14.241 --> 00:37:19.639
This is my great honor that…(speaking
Marathi and Hindi to someone)

00:37:23.759 --> 00:37:28.667
So… Let them come, if they want to come.”

00:37:35.694 --> 00:37:39.276
So then the program is that day
after tomorrow,

00:37:39.301 --> 00:37:44.259
after this thing he says it will be over
by 12:30 or one′o clock.

00:37:44.284 --> 00:37:48.661
So you will have tonight and tomorrow
full day for your shopping.

00:37:48.686 --> 00:37:52.203
But I think then you should not bother
more about shopping.

00:37:52.228 --> 00:37:54.785
Whatever you have to do, better finish
tomorrow.

00:37:54.810 --> 00:37:57.743
And then you have to come
to the program also.

00:37:57.768 --> 00:38:01.521
Day after if you linger on then it will
be very difficult.

00:38:01.546 --> 00:38:07.396
So all of you should go there, have your
food, and then go to Ganapatipule.

00:38:07.421 --> 00:38:11.451
This is the program. So you reach
Ganapatipule in the evening.

00:38:11.476 --> 00:38:13.992
I hope it’s all clear to you.

00:38:14.017 --> 00:38:17.977
And whatever you want to buy, you have
to buy here. But I would say

00:38:18.002 --> 00:38:22.443
that some of you are really, really
do not know what is real silk is.

00:38:22.468 --> 00:38:25.500
And I've seen some people buying
something horrid.

00:38:25.525 --> 00:38:29.417
And very thin silk you should not buy
because it will last only for eight days.

00:38:29.442 --> 00:38:32.498
And then it will be finished. So don’t go
for cheap things.

00:38:32.523 --> 00:38:37.724
One sari which is good sari, silk sari,
is better than ten bad saris.

00:38:37.749 --> 00:38:42.102
Luckily now we have some saris that you
wanted for, the printed saris

00:38:42.127 --> 00:38:46.955
which I can give you in Ganapatipule.
Nice printed saris,

00:38:46.980 --> 00:38:54.135
of the tassar and also silk. We’ll have
them there. You can all buy, there.

00:38:55.566 --> 00:38:58.125
Anything else?

00:38:58.704 --> 00:39:04.633
Because I don’t think I’ll meet you any
more perhaps till we go to Ganapatipule.

00:39:04.658 --> 00:39:09.885
Now also if you could get those
bhajan things, please buy.

00:39:09.910 --> 00:39:13.736
I have given you presents twice. But you
never bring them on your tour

00:39:13.761 --> 00:39:19.306
and this time again, I don’t want to get
this kind of a thing. (Hindi).

00:39:19.331 --> 00:39:26.340
Just show them. Anything of this kind,
please get it. Is very important.

00:39:26.365 --> 00:39:31.766
I have given you twice as presents
but it’s very difficult every time

00:39:31.791 --> 00:39:37.967
to go to the shop and get it for you.
If you can get them please buy.

00:39:37.992 --> 00:39:44.181
Some of you should at least have them.
(speaking marathi to someone)

00:39:52.533 --> 00:39:56.618
He will organize, you better purchase.

00:40:03.298 --> 00:40:09.636
Now all the marriages practically have
been decided. One or two are left,

00:40:09.661 --> 00:40:14.913
which he has also adjusted. Now those who
were over age or something like that,

00:40:14.938 --> 00:40:17.508
we could not arrange their marriages.
Doesn’t matter.

00:40:17.533 --> 00:40:20.274
It may work out, it may not work out.
Doesn’t matter.

00:40:20.299 --> 00:40:24.650
After all, you are in Sahaja Yoga. I mean,
you are really married to Sahaja Yoga,

00:40:24.675 --> 00:40:29.165
that’s all. This is something sideways,
you see.

00:40:29.190 --> 00:40:32.478
So don’t make very, your life
miserable,

00:40:32.503 --> 00:40:36.000
so all the way you have come, to know
that you are not ...

00:40:36.025 --> 00:40:40.219
we have not been able to arrange
your marriage. It’s not proper.

00:40:40.244 --> 00:40:44.000
Just enjoy. Don’t miss the point.

00:40:44.025 --> 00:40:47.306
May God bless you.
