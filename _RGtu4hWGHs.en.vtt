00:00.780 --> 00:15.089
Acupuncture is actually is the tapping of
the power which is already within us.

00:15.089 --> 00:19.330
Now for example, you have a certain power
in your stomach.

00:19.330 --> 00:20.590
All right?

00:20.590 --> 00:29.080
Now this power is continuously supplied to
your other organs in the stomach.

00:29.080 --> 00:30.080
All right?

00:30.080 --> 00:32.500
It is used for that.

00:32.500 --> 00:39.499
Now through the sympathetic nervous system,
the parasympathetic stores it and the sympathetic

00:39.499 --> 00:41.749
uses it.

00:41.749 --> 00:45.670
Now supposing there is a disease in the stomach.

00:45.670 --> 00:53.519
So now the energy in that, vital energy, in
that particular center, is sort of exhausted

00:53.519 --> 00:56.300
or is much less.

00:56.300 --> 00:58.620
So what do they do?

00:58.620 --> 01:00.999
How to get well that person?

01:00.999 --> 01:05.540
They take from another center, divert it,
and put it there.

01:05.540 --> 01:09.310
And that’s how, you did try to cure that.

01:09.310 --> 01:17.470
But by that they create an imbalance because
you have a limited area, you have a limited,

01:17.470 --> 01:19.880
absolutely limited, energy.

01:19.880 --> 01:25.350
Now this limited – supposing you have a
limited petrol and another car you find whose

01:25.350 --> 01:27.700
petrol is all finished.

01:27.700 --> 01:33.289
Now if you push the petrol into another car
maybe that car will go half way and you will

01:33.289 --> 01:35.969
also go half way and finished.

01:35.969 --> 01:37.000
You understand my point?

01:37.000 --> 01:43.009
So both of them reduce your longevity.

01:43.009 --> 01:47.759
So it is the extraction of the energy which
is within us, which is limited.

01:47.759 --> 01:50.299
Sahaja Yoga is a very different thing.

01:50.299 --> 01:56.310
In Sahaja yoga your Kundalini rises and connects
you with the all-pervading power.

01:56.310 --> 02:00.100
So all the time you are getting power, the
vital power within you flowing.

02:00.100 --> 02:02.509
And there is no sort of death of that power.

02:02.509 --> 02:05.259
It’s all the time flowing, the grace.

02:05.259 --> 02:12.370
But here when you tap one energy to another
there’s no proper understanding how much

02:12.370 --> 02:13.970
to give, how much to balance.

02:13.970 --> 02:16.190
And there is no need at all.

02:16.190 --> 02:20.930
Once you are a Realized soul supposing somebody
has a stomach trouble you have to just put

02:20.930 --> 02:23.840
your hand on the stomach, finished.

02:23.840 --> 02:24.840
This person you can cure.

02:24.840 --> 02:26.909
You can cure cancer, you can cure anything.

02:26.909 --> 02:30.860
Because you become the source of that energy
and your energy is not limited, you are getting

02:30.860 --> 02:34.920
energy from the All-pervading Power.

02:34.920 --> 02:36.470
You are connected with it.

02:36.470 --> 02:40.970
So what ever you are doing it’s just flowing
like that and you just become a witness of

02:40.970 --> 02:43.080
that power which is flowing.

02:43.080 --> 02:50.090
So you don’t have to mismanage, mishandle
anybody.

02:50.090 --> 02:55.150
You just look after that part which requires
energy and you raise the Kundalini and give

02:55.150 --> 02:59.909
Realization to that sick person also, so that
he can give it to another.

02:59.909 --> 03:03.159
He gets cured, then he can cure others.

03:03.159 --> 03:04.480
It is like that.

03:04.480 --> 03:13.049
So tapping this energy was first started in
China when Zen system came into action.

03:13.049 --> 03:14.170
Zen, you see?

03:14.170 --> 03:17.100
Now Zen is nothing but Sahaja Yoga- same thing
as Zen.

03:17.100 --> 03:21.390
But Zen had only twenty-six Kashyapas in six
centuries.

03:21.390 --> 03:23.099
Kashyapas means Realized souls.

03:23.099 --> 03:27.750
Only twenty-six in six centuries.

03:27.750 --> 03:28.750
And now there are none.

03:28.750 --> 03:31.040
I have met the chairman of the Zen who came
here.

03:31.040 --> 03:34.280
You see he is a chairman, I don’t know how
he is a chairman.

03:34.280 --> 03:36.439
His Kundalini is just closed on there.

03:36.439 --> 03:40.980
He cannot get Realization I tell you, he is
beyond Realization.

03:40.980 --> 03:43.790
He was sick so they took Me to him.

03:43.790 --> 03:50.010
And they he said that: “Yes You have healed
me, this, that give me your healing power”.

03:50.010 --> 03:51.050
I said: “You’ll have to take your Realization”.

03:51.050 --> 03:52.379
He said: “How can I be a Kashyapa?

03:52.379 --> 03:57.879
there were only so many, how can I be a Kashyapa.

03:57.879 --> 04:00.840
I’m not still the-“ I said: “You will
become.

04:00.840 --> 04:03.049
Why don’t you take it?”

04:03.049 --> 04:04.579
But see he was on like this.

04:04.579 --> 04:06.319
He wouldn’t take Realization.

04:06.319 --> 04:09.409
They want to live in ignorance.

04:09.409 --> 04:16.049
So, main thing is you first get your Realization;
you get your power within yourself and manifest

04:16.049 --> 04:17.280
it into others.

04:17.280 --> 04:20.350
4:19
But no use putting oil from here to here and

04:20.350 --> 04:21.780
there to there.

04:21.780 --> 04:25.620
At least let one oil burn; you will have only
stomach trouble.

04:25.620 --> 04:30.150
Otherwise the whole body will collapse, which
was to collapse.

04:30.150 --> 04:33.770
Say the stomach trouble is there, then it’s
it is all right; you can continue with the

04:33.770 --> 04:34.770
stomach trouble.

04:34.770 --> 04:39.720
But, if you remove it from your head there,
then within say 5 days everybody is finished.

04:39.720 --> 04:45.550
Moreover it has a.- it attacks heart, it attacks
heart that’s the main point.

04:45.550 --> 04:49.470
And acupuncture is one thing I’ve seen,
those who take acupuncture are difficult to

04:49.470 --> 04:50.470
get Realization.

04:50.470 --> 04:55.419
Even if they get it, it is difficult to maintain
because of the imbalances created in the body.

04:55.419 --> 04:57.870
We should not create any imbalance ourself.

04:57.870 --> 05:03.400
Already we have created it, at the most if
you have to do anything balance it.

05:03.400 --> 05:09.280
Do not create more imbalances and this is
what is happening with these all things which

05:09.280 --> 05:10.280
are done in ignorance.

05:10.280 --> 05:13.780
They do not tell you what you do really, they
never tell you.

05:13.780 --> 05:17.460
Like TM they don’t tell you what it is,
it is nothing but possession.

05:17.460 --> 05:22.200
They are possessing you absolutely they are
possessing you.

05:22.200 --> 05:26.110
They mesmerize you they don’t tell you we
mesmerize and put a possession on you.

05:26.110 --> 05:29.250
If they tell you won’t pay money to this
fellow.

05:29.250 --> 05:31.130
Isn’t it?

05:31.130 --> 05:32.130
So they won’t tell you.

05:32.130 --> 05:34.000
They say it is transcendental meditation.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.880
How do you go to trance ask any Indian?

05:35.880 --> 05:36.880
he’ll tell you.

05:36.880 --> 05:40.050
You can only go into trance through mesmerism.

05:40.050 --> 05:44.440
Mesmerism comes through only spirits.

05:44.440 --> 05:48.759
Spirits when they get you, when you get possessed
then only you get into trance.

05:48.759 --> 05:52.130
That’s why they are behaving like this jumping
like this.

05:52.130 --> 05:58.020
Now people are paying for getting convulsions
and epilepsy.

05:58.020 --> 06:02.910
This look at this Verner Leven such an educated
man he writes that if you go to Rajneesh you

06:02.910 --> 06:03.910
get convulsions.

06:03.910 --> 06:09.840
I mean there is even more reason you should
not go.

06:09.840 --> 06:13.420
You pay to get convulsions and to get epilepsy?

06:13.420 --> 06:19.020
First of all you cannot pay; first of all,
if it is real.

06:19.020 --> 06:21.419
Because it is too real to be bought.

06:21.419 --> 06:22.419
All right?

06:22.419 --> 06:23.419
First of all.

06:23.419 --> 06:25.759
The first thing is this.

06:25.759 --> 06:33.650
And the second thing is that whatever you
get should transform you completely into a

06:33.650 --> 06:34.650
beautiful person.

06:34.650 --> 06:41.639
Your health must improve, your mind must improve,
you should be a fine person, your temperament

06:41.639 --> 06:46.930
must change, your habits must change, your
priorities must change, you should be a person

06:46.930 --> 06:48.520
who is a master of yourself.

06:48.520 --> 06:56.500
Instead of going to this man means or to that
guru means you become a worse person.

06:56.500 --> 06:58.810
That’s what is happening.

06:58.810 --> 07:04.330
How can that be?

07:04.330 --> 07:08.990
And this is not to be achieved through rationality
because rationality is limited.

07:08.990 --> 07:12.140
It’s a state of mind where you jump into
it.

07:12.140 --> 07:15.300
It’s an actualization; it happens to you.

07:15.300 --> 07:18.900
Something that is actual should happen to
you.

07:18.900 --> 07:23.889
You cannot just rationalize it sitting down
“Oh I am I’m God, I am Brahma”.

07:23.889 --> 07:25.250
How do you become?

07:25.250 --> 07:28.070
Supposing sitting down here, I say: “I am
Queen Elizabeth”.

07:28.070 --> 07:31.379
They’ll arrest Me and put it in the jail.

07:31.379 --> 07:36.379
[Laughter]
You see my point?

07:36.379 --> 07:38.520
So all these gurus are doing the same thing.

07:38.520 --> 07:41.330
And now see you are having problems with that.

07:41.330 --> 07:45.520
You can see that sitting and all that you
are getting all these problems are because

07:45.520 --> 07:46.520
of that.

07:46.520 --> 07:47.970
Now will you please take to something real.

07:47.970 --> 07:50.730
[Shri Mataji laughs]
Lady: What should I take to?

07:50.730 --> 07:51.730
Shri Mataji: You should take to Sahaja Yoga.

07:51.730 --> 07:52.730
All right??

07:52.730 --> 07:57.050
Now give up that Acupuncture for a while,
it’s a horrible stuff.

07:57.050 --> 08:01.000
It’s sinful, I tell you; it spoils Kundalini
of others.

08:01.000 --> 08:04.010
Their chance to realization is diminished.

08:04.010 --> 08:06.960
You would not like to do something like that.

08:06.960 --> 08:11.900
It’s very wrong, it’s very wrong.

08:11.900 --> 08:15.110
It attacks the base of human beings.

08:15.110 --> 08:26.349
Any one of these, any one of them is just
the same.

08:26.349 --> 08:29.330
You can learn Homeopathy.

08:29.330 --> 08:30.330
Homeopathy is better.

08:30.330 --> 08:34.400
Thousand times better than this, if you want
to cure people.

08:34.400 --> 08:38.840
Homeopathy is better it is much more congenial
to human nature.

08:38.840 --> 08:42.420
You can learn Ayurvedic you can learn any
one of these things.

08:42.420 --> 08:44.530
But, I cannot understand this acupuncture
at all.

08:44.530 --> 08:47.380
Chinese don’t use it in China.

08:47.380 --> 08:51.140
Can you imagine?

08:51.140 --> 08:52.140
In China they don’t.

08:52.140 --> 08:54.180
Lady: They use it in China.

08:54.180 --> 08:58.380
Shri Mataji: No they are telling you lies;
they never do it.

08:58.380 --> 09:00.150
I’ve been to China mainland.

09:00.150 --> 09:03.950
They never do it in China.

09:03.950 --> 09:05.760
All telling you lies.

09:05.760 --> 09:09.000
They don’t believe in Lao Tse.

09:09.000 --> 09:14.400
They don’t believe in him at all in mainland
China..

09:14.400 --> 09:17.650
They don’t believe in Lao Tse..

09:17.650 --> 09:19.900
Just they don’t have it.

09:19.900 --> 09:25.450
They have other teas and this and that and
they use certain roots a more ayurvedic style

09:25.450 --> 09:28.520
but not acupuncture they don’t have.

09:28.520 --> 09:31.000
I have been in China Myself.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.260
I asked him about it.

09:33.260 --> 09:35.620
They say, “Lao Tse..

09:35.620 --> 09:37.980
useless fellow,” like that.

09:37.980 --> 09:43.030
You see because after LaoTse very few people
got Realization.

09:43.030 --> 09:46.790
And this one has to know what are the centers
in the hand where they are.

09:46.790 --> 09:51.820
They are also using all wrong points all sympathetic
points they are not using the right points

09:51.820 --> 09:53.380
which are the parasympathetic.

09:53.380 --> 09:58.960
But that you need not do with Realization
now why should you do it?

09:58.960 --> 10:02.290
It’s all right.

10:02.290 --> 10:04.510
All right?

10:04.510 --> 10:08.530
It’s a tremendous task.

10:08.530 --> 10:15.480
One side so many people are ruined; they are
seekers they have to seek.

10:15.480 --> 10:20.080
And so many people have come round with all
kinds of, you see, ignorant stuff.

10:20.080 --> 10:25.470
It’s absolutely naive, absolutely naive
and dangerous.

10:25.470 --> 10:34.550
The other side is, the society is going down;
political people are mad.

10:34.550 --> 10:40.200
You, see it’s all sided, if you see the
whole world, I don’t know what’s happening.

10:40.200 --> 10:41.550
In America people are so mad.

10:41.550 --> 10:47.370
The other day I saw a picture; I don’t know
you saw that BBC thing, it was horrible.

10:47.370 --> 10:55.180
I mean, I don’t know, and then one of the
interviewer even asked that this is don’t

10:55.180 --> 11:00.900
you think this is too much you are going too
far with this kind of mass nonsense?

11:00.900 --> 11:02.120
And why should you do it?

11:02.120 --> 11:10.820
Is it not that because of all these sinful
acts the pressure is mounting up in this area

11:10.820 --> 11:13.370
and there will be a big earthquake?

11:13.370 --> 11:16.290
They said we don’t believe in all that.

11:16.290 --> 11:20.500
We have lot of enjoyment and this and that
and they looked horrid.

11:20.500 --> 11:26.080
I mean you could see from their faces that
they were telling lies; there was no enjoyment.

11:26.080 --> 11:29.780
Nothing, you could see sick people, absolutely
sick horrible looking.

11:29.780 --> 11:33.360
All their Agnya catching, Vishuddhi catching,
Mooladhara catching.

11:33.360 --> 11:35.140
What are they happy?

11:35.140 --> 11:40.870
How can they be happy, you see?

11:40.870 --> 11:46.131
They believe in telling lies and believing
in myth and living with it because they think,

11:46.131 --> 11:52.600
you see, that is going to help their ego.

11:52.600 --> 12:00.340
We must ask for reality; we must face it;
see it ourselves, accept it and be one with

12:00.340 --> 12:01.340
it.

12:01.340 --> 12:03.520
That’s just like a warrior.

12:03.520 --> 12:07.070
Otherwise we’ll be cowardly people.

12:07.070 --> 12:13.620
You can see reality clearly you can see.

12:13.620 --> 12:15.300
It’s very easy.

12:15.300 --> 12:16.490
The time has come.

12:16.490 --> 12:17.580
It’s for you people.

12:17.580 --> 12:23.890
You are all seekers of ages; for you only
this is discovered.

12:23.890 --> 12:28.370
All right?

12:28.370 --> 12:37.320
How are you now?

12:37.320 --> 12:43.090
Are you getting the cool breeze?

12:43.090 --> 12:44.330
Lost it?

12:44.330 --> 12:55.230
Don’t think about it; if you start thinking,
you loose it.

12:55.230 --> 13:04.900
Don’t think about it.

13:04.900 --> 13:09.740
Don’t think.

13:09.740 --> 13:41.850
If you think about it, you’ll loose it.

13:41.850 --> 14:15.200
It

14:15.200 --> 14:18.640
is beyond thought.

14:18.640 --> 14:39.890
By thinking you cannot reach there.

14:39.890 --> 14:41.550
All right?

14:41.550 --> 14:43.670
Again it started.

14:43.670 --> 14:45.050
How are you?

14:45.050 --> 14:49.700
Look after your son.

14:49.700 --> 14:57.990
It’s very good, it’s a good point.

14:57.990 --> 15:02.710
Nice you brought it.

15:02.710 --> 15:09.120
Shri Mataji: She’s alright now.

15:09.120 --> 15:16.870
Sahaja Yogini: Yes.

15:16.870 --> 15:33.150
Shri Mataji: You can stay with them or you
stay away.

15:33.150 --> 15:40.590
Sahaja Yogi: Alright.

15:40.590 --> 15:59.130
I will stay with them up to I go away to France.

15:59.130 --> 16:01.200
Shri Mataji: Ah.

16:01.200 --> 16:12.270
Sahaja Yogi: And there I will stay a while
[unsure]

16:12.270 --> 16:22.190
Shri Mataji: No but you can stay.

16:22.190 --> 16:23.280
Go back, alright?

16:23.280 --> 16:39.730
Sahaja Yogi: Thank you
Shri Mataji: ?

16:39.730 --> 16:55.540
will miss you very much.

16:55.540 --> 16:56.540
So beautiful.

16:56.540 --> 17:00.700
He gave her the present you brought for her.

17:00.700 --> 17:03.590
How is your father?

17:03.590 --> 17:08.890
Sahaja Yogi: Now he’s still misbehaving.

17:08.890 --> 17:13.310
Shri Mataji: ?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.

17:13.310 --> 17:19.500
Shri Mataji: ….Put every one around
Imagine

17:19.500 --> 17:28.360
14: 36 Hindi conversation up to 17:42
Cut in the audio

17:28.360 --> 17:33.720
[Laughter]
Shri Mataji: Is it on or off?

17:33.720 --> 17:37.250
Sahaja Yogi: It’s on now.

17:37.250 --> 17:48.830
[Laughter]
Shri Mataji: It’s a very good question.

17:48.830 --> 17:57.730
You see when you meditate; how do you meditate
on different chakras?

17:57.730 --> 18:12.940
Say you have to meditate on Mooladhara, now
you pay attention towards Mooladhara and take

18:12.940 --> 18:14.670
the name of Shri Ganesha.

18:14.670 --> 18:17.240
Say the mantra.

18:17.240 --> 18:24.680
You know there are four petals; so every – that
mantra should be every time should be four

18:24.680 --> 18:26.309
times should be said.

18:26.309 --> 18:28.430
Four into four you can say.

18:28.430 --> 18:31.960
Pay attention there.

18:31.960 --> 18:41.800
Now physically also say we have a Nabhi Chakra
so many of you catch at Nabhi.

18:41.800 --> 18:51.510
If you have a liver problem, you can rub a
little sugar on your Nabhi, will be a good

18:51.510 --> 18:52.510
idea.

18:52.510 --> 19:00.540
Or if you have the left hand side problem
of Nabhi if you rub a little oil or ghee or

19:00.540 --> 19:03.240
something it will be a good idea.

19:03.240 --> 19:05.510
And then concentrate on that.

19:05.510 --> 19:09.500
Try to put attention on to that specially
the chakras which are not all right.

19:09.500 --> 19:14.330
You just pay attention to it and meditate
on them.

19:14.330 --> 19:16.990
Pay attention to it is the main point.

19:16.990 --> 19:25.260
If you pay attention with the mantras saying,
that’s how you can meditate on every chakra.

19:25.260 --> 19:29.750
And if two people can do it, is a better idea.

19:29.750 --> 19:37.250
Is, you see, in your back, on your back; if
you show the spinal chord, you can see what

19:37.250 --> 19:40.620
chakras are bulging out.

19:40.620 --> 19:44.810
Other person can tell you these are the portions
which are bulging out.

19:44.810 --> 19:50.020
So you go on saying the mantras of that chakra
paying attention and the other person can

19:50.020 --> 19:52.730
tell you whether it is all right or not.

19:52.730 --> 19:57.050
For every chakra there is a mantra, which
you know.

19:57.050 --> 20:05.370
Apart from mantra, you must know what things
should be used which element should be used

20:05.370 --> 20:08.030
for which chakra.

20:08.030 --> 20:15.200
For example, for using say, Mooladhara chakra,
best way to clear out Mooladhara chakra is

20:15.200 --> 20:17.231
sit on the ground.

20:17.231 --> 20:18.231
It’s the best way.

20:18.231 --> 20:24.330
I’ve told you how to do the exercise to
be able to sit on the ground straight, it’s

20:24.330 --> 20:31.680
very good idea of asking the mother earth
to clear out your Mooladhara.

20:31.680 --> 20:41.550
For say example, if you have to clear out
say your Nabhi, for Nabhi is made out of the

20:41.550 --> 20:50.820
water element and that’s why you have to
ask the water element to help you.

20:50.820 --> 20:53.500
And for Nabhi water element is the best.

20:53.500 --> 20:59.260
If you can use the water element to clear
your Nabhi, it will be a very good idea.

20:59.260 --> 21:05.020
Like that, every chakra is made from some
element as it is.

21:05.020 --> 21:14.640
Swadisthana is made of earth and water; so
the sea is the best for Swadhistana.

21:14.640 --> 21:19.680
If you could go to the sea and work out on
Swadhisthana, will be the best for you.

21:19.680 --> 21:28.420
In the ocean or you can use salt and water
for Swadhisthana; will be very good.

21:28.420 --> 21:37.520
Then we can say that for the heart chakra,
heart chakra is, has to do with the, what

21:37.520 --> 21:38.840
you call, the akash.

21:38.840 --> 21:49.780
Firmament, with the firmament, this heart
chakra is with the – ah, no not firmament,

21:49.780 --> 21:50.780
akash?

21:50.780 --> 21:54.150
Akash “ne”, [no in Hindi].

21:54.150 --> 21:56.430
It’s made out of air [Hindi mika he?]

21:56.430 --> 22:02.390
Air is called vayu, vayu is air.

22:02.390 --> 22:07.530
Air or you call it air as an element you call
the word air?

22:07.530 --> 22:09.280
Or firmament?

22:09.280 --> 22:12.470
Firmament is ether, in English isn’t it?

22:12.470 --> 22:18.520
So air, you can say air, air element is for
the heart chakra.

22:18.520 --> 22:23.860
So for that, I have told you how to do, I
mean, breathing.

22:23.860 --> 22:29.250
Breathing is the best way of hold your breath
before the photograph.

22:29.250 --> 22:36.870
Or you can take the breath in, deep breathing
and releasing it for a longer period.

22:36.870 --> 22:40.650
Cleaning it, all these exercises are there.

22:40.650 --> 22:47.640
Then you see the mantra is of raksha, is the
protection, to ask for the protection is all

22:47.640 --> 22:48.950
with the air.

22:48.950 --> 22:51.550
All right?

22:51.550 --> 23:32.190
Then we come to this one is here is
the akash, must be firmament.

23:32.190 --> 23:35.900
What is a firmament in English?

23:35.900 --> 23:38.380
Ether?

23:38.380 --> 23:39.380
Firmament is ether?

23:39.380 --> 23:45.530
All right, so this is the firmament, you see,
I read one translation but I was not sure.

23:45.530 --> 23:47.770
This is the akash, is the sky.

23:47.770 --> 23:51.960
This is the sky, here, all right?

23:51.960 --> 24:02.540
This is made out of the sky firmament and
this is made out of the light.

24:02.540 --> 24:07.780
Firmament is sky, is it?

24:07.780 --> 24:15.750
So this is sky; that’s why it is Virata
this thing.

24:15.750 --> 24:19.590
And this is your light.

24:19.590 --> 24:23.720
So for Agnya chakra you have to use the light,
for this you have to use the sky.

24:23.720 --> 24:28.330
If your hands put up like this if you say
“Allah hu Akbar” put both the hands towards

24:28.330 --> 24:29.590
the sky.

24:29.590 --> 24:30.590
See like that.

24:30.590 --> 24:35.190
There are so many ways of using the sky, watching
the sky, looking at the sky.

24:35.190 --> 24:41.800
And for this the sun and the light is to be
used.

24:41.800 --> 24:47.450
Now supposing you are suffering from say left
side problem, is sort of you’re possessed

24:47.450 --> 24:52.860
or something, then you can use the sun you
see because the sun will give you balance.

24:52.860 --> 24:57.420
But if you have the right side problems, like
ego and all that you should use the moon,

24:57.420 --> 24:59.550
put the left hand towards the moon.

24:59.550 --> 25:04.330
But always people do the other way round say
these dramatic melodramatic people you see,

25:04.330 --> 25:09.750
all of them will go to the lunar side in them,
they like the moonlight.

25:09.750 --> 25:15.120
And those who are egoistical will go in the
sun and burn themselves off.

25:15.120 --> 25:16.860
So other way round it should be.

25:16.860 --> 25:20.800
Like that if you use, you can work it out.

25:20.800 --> 25:23.160
All right?

25:23.160 --> 25:24.710
You yourself can manage it.

25:24.710 --> 25:32.390
So these are different centers, which must
be cleansed and meditated onto and or to be

25:32.390 --> 25:34.060
dissolved into their own.

25:34.060 --> 25:41.620
I mean if you dissolve them into their own
element, then you get more strength you see

25:41.620 --> 25:44.170
into that particular body.

25:44.170 --> 25:46.570
It’s like that.

25:46.570 --> 25:57.060
Sahaja Yogi: Can you tell us a bit about sunset;
are we not to look at the sunset?

25:57.060 --> 26:00.470
Shri Mataji: A Sunset is not very good, sunrise,
sunset is not good.

26:00.470 --> 26:07.140
That’s the time the sun is taking away all
the energies from this earth.

26:07.140 --> 26:10.000
So it’s not such a good time to see.

26:10.000 --> 26:17.880
It depends on for example ego-oriented people
if they see sun would be better off.

26:17.880 --> 26:23.960
Little bit of their ego might go down.

26:23.960 --> 26:32.650
But people who have got a left-side problem
should see the sun rise, will be good.

26:32.650 --> 26:34.690
It’s only the other way round.

26:34.690 --> 26:36.170
You see now?

26:36.170 --> 26:37.170
Good question.

26:37.170 --> 26:39.130
Now any other question?

26:39.130 --> 26:40.600
Sahaja Yogini: Yes.

26:40.600 --> 26:47.750
Can you tell me when Kundalini rises, can
we see the Kundalini in each chakra?…

26:47.750 --> 27:00.670
I mean it could rise to repair [unsure] a
chakra at once?

27:00.670 --> 27:10.780
Shri Mataji: Actually normally if your instrument
is perfect you don’t feel it anywhere.

27:10.780 --> 27:17.370
It just comes through and you just feel the
cool breeze from your head and you can feel

27:17.370 --> 27:24.120
the Kundalinis, what you call the fountain,
coming out as cool breeze.

27:24.120 --> 27:29.600
But if your chakras are closed or there’s
some problem or they are defective or sick

27:29.600 --> 27:34.490
or anything is there, then the Kundalini goes
there and hits it.

27:34.490 --> 27:40.059
Like specially Void, if you have a Void, this
thing you can see it clearly at the back of

27:40.059 --> 27:45.510
a person; if the Void is caught up, you can
see that at the end of the Void here; it will

27:45.510 --> 27:47.690
go on pushing like that.

27:47.690 --> 27:58.630
And if the Sushumna, the central path is absolutely
clear cut, a person is absolutely in the center,

27:58.630 --> 28:01.690
then the Kundalini just goes like that straight.

28:01.690 --> 28:04.670
And they also never have any problem later.

28:04.670 --> 28:07.690
Sahaja Yogini: What about the heat in our
chakras?

28:07.690 --> 28:08.690
Shri Mataji: Heat?

28:08.690 --> 28:12.460
Heat comes in if you have a liver problem
or a right side problem.

28:12.460 --> 28:17.590
In the right side is too much of heat; in
the left side it is too much of cold.

28:17.590 --> 28:22.110
Some people feel very cold and they perspire
and this and that.

28:22.110 --> 28:27.890
If you have the left side problem then you
get perspiration, specially with the heart.

28:27.890 --> 28:34.470
Or some people have very low low blood pressure
or who have left side problem, can feel very

28:34.470 --> 28:35.710
cold also.

28:35.710 --> 28:43.020
The heat comes because of liver mainly; those
who have too much of sun in them, the heat

28:43.020 --> 28:44.679
starts coming.

28:44.679 --> 28:50.640
Also heat is a sign of over-activity in a
person, a person is overactive.

28:50.640 --> 28:53.740
Cancer gives too much heat I have seen.

28:53.740 --> 29:00.120
Cancer also gives too much heat, gives so
much heat that one cancer patient can really

29:00.120 --> 29:02.740
make the whole house heated up.

29:02.740 --> 29:05.179
[Laughter]
You don’t need any heater with a cancer

29:05.179 --> 29:08.720
patient if you know how to raise the Kundalini.

29:08.720 --> 29:10.700
And the left side is.

29:10.700 --> 29:11.850
[Laughter.

29:11.850 --> 29:19.190
Shri Mataji laughs] It’s a common experience.

29:19.190 --> 29:24.790
It’s very interesting you know; Sahaja Yoga
is very interesting.

29:24.790 --> 29:29.950
Even cancer makes you laugh, the way the things
are.

29:29.950 --> 29:34.610
But surprisingly, you’ll be amazed that
I have not come across one cancer patient

29:34.610 --> 29:36.510
so far who is just right sided.

29:36.510 --> 29:38.410
Always he ends up in the left.

29:38.410 --> 29:45.330
Means he must have had some sort of a problem
with a black magic or some bad guru, or some

29:45.330 --> 29:50.790
sort of a thing which is unauthorized against
God; something like that.

29:50.790 --> 30:00.000
Cancer is always, I have seen it always, leukemia,
treated cancer of the, what you call peritoneum,

30:00.000 --> 30:05.240
cancer of kidneys, cancer of lungs; all of
them had this.

30:05.240 --> 30:10.910
That means somewhere a guru or somebody or
some black magic or spiritualist or something

30:10.910 --> 30:18.740
like that, he has intervened with the personality,
and then you get this cancer business.

30:18.740 --> 30:23.840
It’s a remarkable thing.

30:23.840 --> 30:31.830
Sahaja Yogini: Does the heat always indicate
a cancer problem?

30:31.830 --> 30:33.590
Shri Mataji: Cancer?

30:33.590 --> 30:35.929
No no no no.

30:35.929 --> 30:38.420
No no no no no no.

30:38.420 --> 30:42.660
Heat indicates liver, mainly liver.

30:42.660 --> 30:44.360
All right?

30:44.360 --> 30:49.740
And cancer is also; it’s when the cells
become ego-oriented, you see, a person who

30:49.740 --> 30:55.300
is ego oriented, they think too much, they
work very hard, means they get liver.

30:55.300 --> 30:56.300
You see?

30:56.300 --> 31:07.110
Because one center has to do the liver, the
pancreas, the spleen, the kidneys and uterus.

31:07.110 --> 31:08.110
Imagine.

31:08.110 --> 31:13.450
And the same has to make -look after the cells
for the brain, the same center, Swadisthana.

31:13.450 --> 31:19.210
When it has to work both the things, naturally,
if you start thinking too much, then what

31:19.210 --> 31:20.220
happens?

31:20.220 --> 31:22.090
That these are neglected.

31:22.090 --> 31:26.770
So you develop liver, you develop kidney;
you develop diabetes, you develop uterus troubles.

31:26.770 --> 31:27.770
You see?

31:27.770 --> 31:29.840
All these things can happen.

31:29.840 --> 31:35.559
Apart from that, it goes further; by that
time, when you do it, overdo it, then your

31:35.559 --> 31:43.910
left side starts freezing
[Cut in the audio]

31:43.910 --> 31:46.440
Ego orientation of any society will give you
more heart attacks.

31:46.440 --> 31:53.540
But when ego develops too much in a society,
people start seeing it; then they get frightened

31:53.540 --> 31:58.799
of the ego, then they must drink, because,
just to run away from the ego that they can’t

31:58.799 --> 31:59.799
bear to see themselves that egoistical.

31:59.799 --> 32:00.799
So they drink, they take to drugs, these things
to run away because they can’t just bear

32:00.799 --> 32:02.870
the ego of people.

32:02.870 --> 32:11.220
They find they are really silly idiots you
see going around.

32:11.220 --> 32:14.049
So they don’t want to be like them; so they
take the other side.

32:14.049 --> 32:17.790
When they go to the other side they go to
the left side.

32:17.790 --> 32:22.370
Now when going to the left side both things
being sort of very much fought up, there’s

32:22.370 --> 32:27.470
a wobbling going on in your brain; with that
you develop all these problems.

32:27.470 --> 32:37.110
But if you are only left sided you may be
absolutely reading only Lord Byron and you

32:37.110 --> 32:38.940
can land up in lunatic asylum.

32:38.940 --> 32:41.720
You can, I’ve seen one like that.

32:41.720 --> 32:46.210
Only reading Lord Byron could be possible
because he just makes you miserable.

32:46.210 --> 32:51.170
He, himself, was a very funny man but he wants
everybody to be miserable.

32:51.170 --> 32:57.940
You see and he always sings songs of such
cry, I mean such a man I don’t know how

32:57.940 --> 33:00.790
he developed this kind of a melodramatic stuff.

33:00.790 --> 33:06.450
But I’ve known people who came to Me who
have been just crying reading this Lord Byron.

33:06.450 --> 33:13.030
He himself enjoyed life very well.

33:13.030 --> 33:20.510
So one has to take a very, very wise and sane
attitude towards life.

33:20.510 --> 33:30.970
That you are the eternal life, that you are
the eternal being and you have come on this

33:30.970 --> 33:36.450
earth to enjoy all the blessings that God
has created and not for weeping and crying

33:36.450 --> 33:37.450
and feeling guilty.

33:37.450 --> 33:38.470
That’s not your job.

33:38.470 --> 33:39.470
First thing is that.

33:39.470 --> 33:40.470
This is wisdom.

33:40.470 --> 33:47.080
And you are not going to make miserable about
small, small things of life also.

33:47.080 --> 33:52.280
Like the other day I saw a very interesting
story of a husband wife quarreling ending

33:52.280 --> 33:55.840
up into a divorce and poor husband had no
house, you see.

33:55.840 --> 33:57.620
So he went to his brother’s place.

33:57.620 --> 34:01.860
The brother’s wife very particular about
everything; she had three pets.

34:01.860 --> 34:08.330
So he could not put the box anywhere because
she would say.

34:08.330 --> 34:09.740
“No no no no no!

34:09.740 --> 34:11.149
There is another pet here!”

34:11.149 --> 34:13.130
Again, poor thing would lift it up.

34:13.130 --> 34:14.830
Then, “No no no no no!

34:14.830 --> 34:15.830
Not there!

34:15.830 --> 34:16.990
There is another pet; then another there like
that you see.

34:16.990 --> 34:24.530
All the time worried about small, small petty
things of life.

34:24.530 --> 34:27.050
Also that can create a problem of ego orientation.

34:27.050 --> 34:31.190
Live in a very carefree manner.

34:31.190 --> 34:37.409
It’s not so important but that doesn’t
mean laziness.

34:37.409 --> 34:40.340
I must tell you that doesn’t mean la – zi
–ness.

34:40.340 --> 34:44.419
Spell it with capital letters, all of you.

34:44.419 --> 34:58.290
By any chance it doesn’t mean that; it means
hard work – but enjoy it and not to be involved

34:58.290 --> 35:05.820
into things, which are of no importance at
all, useless things.

35:05.820 --> 35:11.400
Here it is joy spread for you.

35:11.400 --> 35:18.820
Why are you bothered about these things?

35:18.820 --> 35:25.869
They’re not meant for you.

35:25.869 --> 35:28.690
Isn’t it?

35:28.690 --> 35:35.690
Ah ha I – David, you see, thank God you
told Me about it because I found, I remembered,

35:35.690 --> 35:39.109
that the Secretary of our Health Ministry
in Delhi, himself, came to see Me.

35:39.109 --> 35:45.771
He was there for three hours because our President
has told him that Mataji has cured him and

35:45.771 --> 35:48.230
he’s very anxious to verify it.

35:48.230 --> 35:56.950
That saying particular sounds, say for the
Vishuddhi, like there are sixteen: uh, ah,

35:56.950 --> 36:05.080
e, ee, u, oo lu, glu, gloo, loo, a, I, o ,ou,
, um ahum – sixteen.

36:05.080 --> 36:11.140
Now all these sixteen sounds are for sixteen
petals, but you need not do all that.

36:11.140 --> 36:15.070
If you just say the innermost thing is Virat.

36:15.070 --> 36:17.930
There is no need to have the sounds or anything.

36:17.930 --> 36:25.920
Just you say “Virat” and it opens out.

36:25.920 --> 36:39.950
No use knowing, unnecessary, because we have
gone to the center most part, you see, called

36:39.950 --> 36:42.330
as the Brahma nadi.

36:42.330 --> 36:49.160
You see, if you have to go, say, from the
leaf to the root, then you have to know all

36:49.160 --> 36:50.160
the way.

36:50.160 --> 36:56.910
But if you are coming from the root, inside
the root, then what is the need?

36:56.910 --> 37:05.570
When they move that way, then only they knew
all these things.

37:05.570 --> 37:14.720
Say, in this house or in any building, you
have a lift just in the center, you see, and

37:14.720 --> 37:15.720
moving upward.

37:15.720 --> 37:17.040
You don’t have to know.

37:17.040 --> 37:18.710
You just move.

37:18.710 --> 37:24.680
But, if you have to come from outside every
time, every chakra, you will never be able

37:24.680 --> 37:26.740
to enter inside the lift.

37:26.740 --> 37:33.859
But you’ll be doing all; you will know everything
about that particular chakra from outside.

37:33.859 --> 37:39.430
But you’ll never get in; it is all the sympathetic
movement.

37:39.430 --> 37:45.640
So there is no need to know; like this I was
telling you, this is the center and this is

37:45.640 --> 37:47.440
the left and this is the right.

37:47.440 --> 37:50.750
You can come from the left and go back to
the left or you come from the left and go

37:50.750 --> 37:51.750
to the right.

37:51.750 --> 37:56.250
But, you cannot get inside and this inside
getting is the point.

37:56.250 --> 38:01.240
That’s the way you do it.

38:01.240 --> 38:02.240
All right?

38:02.240 --> 38:03.240
So there is no need to, this is all again
rambling.

38:03.240 --> 38:05.690
[Speaking to someone]
Better now?

38:05.690 --> 38:08.160
Better she is.

38:08.160 --> 38:11.940
What do you think; is she better?
