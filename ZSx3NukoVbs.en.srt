1
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:12,030
But as Kundalini rises, on every center

2
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:15,360
you start getting the light of that center.

3
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,620
At the first center you get back your innocence,

4
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:27,390
your eyes become innocent, your behavior becomes innocent,

5
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:30,130
you are not filled with lust and greed,

6
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:33,140
you don’t look at things with lust and greed,

7
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:36,610
but you look at things with innocence,

8
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:40,359
which is a very big thing that people have lost

9
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:45,320
and that you get back and such a person develops many qualities.

10
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:51,021
One of them is that such a person is full of fragrance,

11
00:00:51,141 --> 00:00:56,539
such a person has a tremendous gravity,

12
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:02,916
tremendous gravity, and such a person has tremendous dynamism,

13
00:01:03,035 --> 00:01:07,080
and attraction is a bad word so I don’t want to use it,

14
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,430
but magnetical.

15
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:13,190
His magnets is awakened within him,

16
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:18,490
this is the center of your magnet of the earth.

17
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:24,320
Such a person develops a tremendous sense of roads

18
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:27,430
and sense of direction, you place him anywhere

19
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:31,994
he will know where to go. Like birds, you place birds anywhere

20
00:01:32,114 --> 00:01:34,600
they know which side is north, south, east, west.

21
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:40,430
In the same way you also develop your lost innocence

22
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:46,460
and your magnet within you by which you have proper direction;

23
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:50,880
but the highest of all you develop the proper direction

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,662
to wisdom which is the wise thing to do.

25
00:01:54,782 --> 00:01:59,000
You just don’t do stupid things, you just don’t do,

26
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:02,420
even if you ever try to do it, you will not do it,

27
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:07,666
because you know it is so stupid, just you don’t do it.

28
00:02:07,786 --> 00:02:13,350
I mean it is so simple to be wise than to be stupid,

29
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:16,710
because if you have to be stupid you have to go out of the way

30
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:21,999
to be stupid and idiotic; but if you want to be

31
00:02:22,119 --> 00:02:25,190
normal and wise is the easiest thing to do.

32
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:30,020
But what people do is to do things that would make them

33
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:34,830
more and more stupid, nonsensical,

34
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:39,160
because also some people told Me they do it,

35
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:44,290
the reason being they think they have a nuisance value.

36
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:47,701
Like in London now we have one funny stuff going on,

37
00:02:47,821 --> 00:02:51,848
they call it what? “Punk rock.” You see, it’s a funny stuff.

38
00:02:51,968 --> 00:02:55,001
Now poor kids they don’t know what they are doing it,

39
00:02:55,121 --> 00:03:00,999
and I think the only value of that punk rock system is this:

40
00:03:01,119 --> 00:03:08,900
that they try to sort of make a nuisance out of them

41
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:11,170
so that people feel attracted towards them

42
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:14,320
or sort of a significance out of them.

43
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:19,639
But when you become a realized soul you realize your significance,

44
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:23,400
because you understand you are part and parcel of the whole

45
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:29,529
and that your significance is to give Realization to others,

46
00:03:29,649 --> 00:03:31,804
the highest of highest,

47
00:03:31,924 --> 00:03:34,639
that’s what you have to do now you are a saint,

48
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:39,389
and that’s how the whole attitude of cheapiness,

49
00:03:39,509 --> 00:03:42,919
of outward shallowness finishes

50
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:47,420
and you become a serene, dignified personality.

51
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:51,327
This is not possible through any sermon, any lecture,

52
00:03:51,447 --> 00:03:54,249
it’s only possible when the Kundalini rises

53
00:03:54,369 --> 00:04:01,708
you become like a very dignified child, very dignified child.

54
00:04:01,828 --> 00:04:05,620
I’ve seen one beautiful painting done

55
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:10,938
of Mother Mary being taught first time.

56
00:04:11,058 --> 00:04:15,643
You see Her as a child, She is a very dignified personality,

57
00:04:15,763 --> 00:04:17,916
as a child, She is about ten years of age.

58
00:04:18,036 --> 00:04:21,507
I’ve seen My own grandchildren who are not very old

59
00:04:21,627 --> 00:04:24,198
but extremely dignified.

60
00:04:24,318 --> 00:04:27,460
They walk like kings, behave like kings.

61
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:30,925
In every behavior you find there’s such a dignity,

62
00:04:31,045 --> 00:04:34,698
they’ll never do something shallow, they never ask for anything,

63
00:04:34,818 --> 00:04:37,328
they never weep for anything, they never cry for anything,

64
00:04:37,448 --> 00:04:40,885
they are so dignified and they understand it so well

65
00:04:41,005 --> 00:04:43,727
what is dignity is. I don’t have to tell them,

66
00:04:43,847 --> 00:04:45,369
because they are born realized,

67
00:04:45,489 --> 00:04:49,771
in the same way you become, nobody has to tell you

68
00:04:49,891 --> 00:04:52,604
that “do this, or do that,” but you understand

69
00:04:52,724 --> 00:04:57,644
that you must have self-respect. This happens to you automatically,

70
00:04:57,764 --> 00:05:00,760
this is actualization, nobody has to tell you

71
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,722
that “you be dignified,” you just become.

72
00:05:02,842 --> 00:05:05,514
I’ve seen people who were absolutely absurd,

73
00:05:05,634 --> 00:05:08,495
even from this punk rock we got some people

74
00:05:08,615 --> 00:05:12,687
and they were so changed that people could not recognize them,

75
00:05:12,807 --> 00:05:15,777
but one thing bad has happened with this punk rock

76
00:05:15,901 --> 00:05:19,043
that they put some sort of dye in their head

77
00:05:19,163 --> 00:05:22,025
and since then their eyes became very weak,

78
00:05:22,145 --> 00:05:26,152
because these dyes I think made the optic globe

79
00:05:26,272 --> 00:05:29,414
covered with some sort of a color

80
00:05:29,534 --> 00:05:32,246
and you can’t see properly, and the eyes became very weak

81
00:05:32,366 --> 00:05:36,028
and it took some time for us to remove the effect

82
00:05:36,148 --> 00:05:38,324
of those dyes from their head.

83
00:05:38,444 --> 00:05:42,010
We go headlong, “what’s wrong?” There is nothing wrong

84
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:44,870
in this world if it is a stupid fool,

85
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:47,691
but for a wise man there are very many things

86
00:05:47,811 --> 00:05:51,633
which are absolutely wrong, and there are very many things

87
00:05:51,753 --> 00:05:54,594
which are absolutely correct,

88
00:05:54,714 --> 00:05:58,425
so you develop your wisdom by this first center.
