00:18.230 --> 00:24.240
but first and foremost thing is to

00:20.520 --> 00:26.310
meditate and to raise your meditation is

00:24.240 --> 00:29.040
the only way you can grow there's no

00:26.310 --> 00:32.130
other way out because when you meditate

00:29.040 --> 00:35.120
you are in silence you are in

00:32.130 --> 00:38.250
thoughtless awareness then the growth of

00:35.120 --> 00:40.800
awareness takes place then it opens on

00:38.250 --> 00:42.629
but if you are thinking supposing

00:40.800 --> 00:45.290
there's a lake and the lake is

00:42.629 --> 00:49.769
completely in a turmoil nothing can grow

00:45.290 --> 00:51.629
but supposing it is silent then lotuses

00:49.769 --> 00:53.750
can grow and if you can grow in it in

00:51.629 --> 01:00.229
the same way if your mind is agitated

00:53.750 --> 01:04.610
and your growth is not yet fully

01:00.229 --> 01:08.940
expressing itself then it's such a

01:04.610 --> 01:11.490
vicious circle that you are agitated and

01:08.940 --> 01:14.250
your growth is hindered again you are

01:11.490 --> 01:18.030
agitated your growth is inter so the

01:14.250 --> 01:21.990
best way is to take to meditation when

01:18.030 --> 01:24.509
you take to meditation this turmoil will

01:21.990 --> 01:27.060
settle down and ready to settle down

01:24.509 --> 01:29.490
your growth will take place after

01:27.060 --> 01:30.810
meditation will feel definitely that you

01:29.490 --> 01:32.939
have come out very well

01:30.810 --> 01:35.850
you have grown wherever but for that

01:32.939 --> 01:37.619
what has to be very honest you cannot

01:35.850 --> 01:39.600
force people to be honest that's one

01:37.619 --> 01:42.450
thing you can't do you have to be honest

01:39.600 --> 01:44.039
yourself you are not to be hypocrite you

01:42.450 --> 01:45.920
have to see for yourself that whatever

01:44.039 --> 01:48.990
you are doing is for your benevolence

01:45.920 --> 01:51.840
it's for your good and that you have to

01:48.990 --> 01:54.539
do it because it is good for you to

01:51.840 --> 01:56.789
begin and then for the good of the

01:54.539 --> 01:59.429
humanity we are doing for the good of

01:56.789 --> 02:00.840
the humanity now some people who come

01:59.429 --> 02:03.659
for the first time will have lots of

02:00.840 --> 02:05.850
doubts because of ego they have lots of

02:03.659 --> 02:09.300
doubts because of ego how can that be

02:05.850 --> 02:13.020
how can this be how I mean all kinds of

02:09.300 --> 02:17.160
things they ask now you have to say that

02:13.020 --> 02:19.830
first of all you develop your inside you

02:17.160 --> 02:22.110
develop your enlightenment your light is

02:19.830 --> 02:26.099
not sufficient in the light only there

02:22.110 --> 02:27.460
are no doubts supposing in darkness you

02:26.099 --> 02:30.760
think that

02:27.460 --> 02:32.350
this table has no cover it's alright you

02:30.760 --> 02:33.940
can think whatever you like but when

02:32.350 --> 02:35.590
there's like to see for yourself there

02:33.940 --> 02:40.090
is a beautiful cover on top of this

02:35.590 --> 02:43.960
table in the same way it happens to us

02:40.090 --> 02:47.800
that we have to achieve a state and as

02:43.960 --> 02:49.540
we achieve that state then there's no

02:47.800 --> 02:52.570
question there's no doubt there's

02:49.540 --> 02:55.720
nothing and you become so empowered it

02:52.570 --> 02:58.480
is such a simultaneous thing it works as

02:55.720 --> 03:01.960
soon as you achieve something it works

02:58.480 --> 03:04.500
when it works then you are convinced

03:01.960 --> 03:08.500
it's so I'd say it was a very beautiful

03:04.500 --> 03:12.550
new chain starts within yourself and

03:08.500 --> 03:16.660
then you really starts enjoying your joy

03:12.550 --> 03:21.610
of yourself in the most chaotic

03:16.660 --> 03:27.970
conditions this world is today so at

03:21.610 --> 03:31.300
that time a kind of a silence will come

03:27.970 --> 03:34.180
within you when there will be any such

03:31.300 --> 03:36.790
crisis immediately become extremely

03:34.180 --> 03:42.430
silent but this is again estate

03:36.790 --> 03:47.980
attempted so now if there is something

03:42.430 --> 03:53.350
that makes you upset or makes you

03:47.980 --> 04:00.340
unhappy try to reach that point that

03:53.350 --> 04:02.950
axis which is just silence and this

04:00.340 --> 04:07.230
silence will make you really powerful

04:02.950 --> 04:10.240
because this silence is not only yours

04:07.230 --> 04:14.980
when you are in that silence you are in

04:10.240 --> 04:20.460
the silence of the cosmos silence of the

04:14.980 --> 04:20.460
cosmos and the silence of the cosmos

04:21.519 --> 04:27.840
works for you you are in connection with

04:30.150 --> 04:36.310
that cosmic power we can call it it's

04:34.389 --> 04:40.330
more than that is divine power I should

04:36.310 --> 04:53.350
say divine power which is working all

04:40.330 --> 04:57.099
the cosmos also so if you just become

04:53.350 --> 05:04.960
silent within yourself know that you are

04:57.099 --> 05:07.199
sitting in the kingdom of God is like

05:04.960 --> 05:07.199
this

05:07.389 --> 05:24.939
when say you get the great honor of

05:17.610 --> 05:31.860
becoming a king then you walk up to your

05:24.939 --> 05:41.620
throne and you sit down and look around

05:31.860 --> 05:47.699
and you feel the silence of the state

05:41.620 --> 05:51.389
that now you are the king this silence

05:47.699 --> 06:01.240
is the sign that you are definitely

05:51.389 --> 06:05.349
definitely you are now in contact with

06:01.240 --> 06:09.029
the divine you're silent because the

06:05.349 --> 06:09.029
divine is going to look after everything

06:09.810 --> 06:16.750
you don't have to do anything just keep

06:12.430 --> 06:22.629
silent but not forcibly it's again a

06:16.750 --> 06:25.479
state see if any turmoil takes place any

06:22.629 --> 06:27.909
problem takes place suddenly your

06:25.479 --> 06:34.629
attention will jump on to that silence

06:27.909 --> 06:36.729
and once you jump on to that silence you

06:34.629 --> 06:39.460
being in contact with this whole

06:36.729 --> 06:42.250
all-pervading power and when I talk

06:39.460 --> 06:46.930
about all-pervading power we still don't

06:42.250 --> 06:49.419
understand what it is what it means this

06:46.930 --> 06:53.349
all-pervading power of love is it some

06:49.419 --> 07:00.069
sort of an energy floating around or is

06:53.349 --> 07:03.960
it some sort of a river or some sort of

07:00.069 --> 07:03.960
a ether

07:06.490 --> 07:18.610
it is the complete the totality of

07:15.860 --> 07:18.610
reality

07:32.810 --> 07:34.870
you
