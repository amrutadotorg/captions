00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.190
most of you are

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:21.930
Now those who have got realization

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.140
the vibrations

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.920
first of all that they are now developing

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.730
into another beam

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.270
The germination has started

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:45.509
And you must allow the germination to work out its own way

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:53.579
but normally

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:57.149
When we get realization also?

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:01.710
We do not realize that

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:06.869
It is a tremendous thing that has happened within us

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.400
That this triggering which is an impossibility?

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:17.249
Has taken place within us, and it has to work out slowly?

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.799
It has to develop and evolve us into that

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:31.229
And because we do not feel it. We do not take it that seriously as we should our realization

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.739
Moreover they are surrounded by people who have not felt the vibrations

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.679
They do not know this area. They have never seen it

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.519
As Guru Nanak has called it it is a locker they have not seen it

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.360
They don't know about it. They don't know there is a power of God that exists

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.689
Which understands coordinates?

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.950
cooperates with you

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.649
Which is working in the collective being?

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.670
Which makes aware?

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:20.109
You aware of that collective being and of others also

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:32.440
This allah car. We can call it upper option which is not seen by anyone which no one knows about

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.859
They talk about they talk about the kingdom of God

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:43.330
They talk about God's powers Divine power, so I'll talk tok tok tok tok

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.340
But once you are triggered into it

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.110
You have to grow into it

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.829
Unless and until you grow into it

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.640
Will be dropped

00:03:03.999 --> 00:03:10.259
Especially for people who have come from fake gurus and from False

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:15.149
Things said they have been following they don't know

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:23.999
How terrible these things are like you're a no crocodile

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:29.668
And suddenly you discourage the crocodile. How fast you would run from that

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:35.699
But even the understanding that it is a crocodile, and it is going to eat you off

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:43.979
Doesn't come up so easily are you going alright?

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:51.569
Alright, so bye. Bye and as I have told you you tell your sister you have to form the nucleus

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.780
And you have to write to me?

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:58.979
About it and that you have to work out

00:03:59.949 --> 00:04:03.719
Very well there all right you tell her what I have told you about Ireland

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:06.689
Alright may God bless you bye

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:09.599
Jim are you going to?

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:11.790
all right, so

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:20.039
This one doesn't realize also

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:26.848
As you do not realize that triggering which is the most difficult thing has happened to you it is difficult

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:32.459
But it has happened to you know why it has happened

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:41.189
If you take that one for granted and also you take the Devil's for granted

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.609
At least don't take the Devil's for granted

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:48.929
Run away from them as soon as possible

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:52.409
meditate meditate

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:58.799
And try to establish yourself in the realm of divine law

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:03.110
I

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:05.110
Say it is divine love

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:08.559
You cannot understand. What's divine. Love is

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:13.899
You cannot understand any human being who loves you only for love's sake

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:21.519
Just because that person loves you. He goes on lovin because he enjoys that loving

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:30.849
In Sanskrit, it is called a garage that there is no interest of God

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:34.900
It's just true

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:41.919
Even when it corrects you it corrects you in love

00:05:46.039 --> 00:05:51.789
And the protection of divine love is the only way you are

00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:57.129
germinating

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:05.139
That love gives you that warmth needed that strengthening that that confidence needed

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:08.799
Everything is given to you by that divine love

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:22.170
So one has to realize that it is love and love and love is the basis of all this creation

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:27.839
God has created this world this universe only because he loved

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:33.120
And he wants to bestow this blessing on you because he loves

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:39.360
Maha far you love yourself is a problem

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:45.240
However, you understand yourself is the problem

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:51.540
You do not evaluate yourself

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:59.730
And that is the reason why though the Kundalini has risen

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:09.089
And you have got realization your vibrations are flowing the growth is very slow

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:16.169
Because attention has been outside

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:20.549
And even after realization it is outside

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:25.680
Sometimes it is sucked in again. It goes outside

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:34.229
Then we do not change our old habits at all we go on sticking to those old habits our

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:40.229
Structure of life our styles of thinking continue to be the same

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:45.330
Again, we find ourselves lost into the same shambles

00:07:52.659 --> 00:07:59.099
Now sahaja Yoga gives you realization alright, but also it gives you a long rope to hang yourself

00:08:04.749 --> 00:08:11.459
if you do not pay heed to yourself and to your being if you don't love yourself and

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:14.310
understand that you are

00:08:14.349 --> 00:08:16.349
the instrument of God by Which

00:08:17.379 --> 00:08:19.589
For the first time you are going to give

00:08:20.469 --> 00:08:22.469
realization to people

00:08:22.689 --> 00:08:29.039
You are going to save people from getting drowned, and this is the first time you are made like that

00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:36.329
This capability you never had and no human beings have which you have got now today

00:08:37.899 --> 00:08:42.299
Very few people had this capability very very few people

00:08:44.139 --> 00:08:46.139
But now you have got that capacity

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:50.579
And you do not want to evaluate yourself

00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:55.740
how important it is

00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:00.300
if you could realize

00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:02.490
Then you would work it out

00:09:02.589 --> 00:09:07.049
Allow the blossoming blossoming to come on the contrary I find

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:10.799
Today because you are all sahaja yogi's. I can talk to you like this

00:09:11.589 --> 00:09:17.969
Normally it is about Kundalini and all that but I find that you do not see the movements of your Kundalini

00:09:18.699 --> 00:09:22.259
You should try to understand and she's the one who loves you the most

00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:25.110
But she is your individual mother

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:31.829
And if you try to follow her you will see that she's suggesting. Where is the problem with you? What you have to correct?

00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:35.519
What you have to do because she wants to perfect you

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
She wants to help you

00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:46.260
So if you start watching it carefully with love with understanding she is very playful

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:50.940
extremely sweetly full of

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:58.349
Beautiful planes like a little child she will tickle you here and there call for your attention. She doesn't trouble you

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:09.850
You have to be just alert about her and she really matures you have seen people with time. How they have matured

00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:16.359
But you have to pay attention to her and to yourself

00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:24.700
Otherwise, what is your value without enlightenment?

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:29.980
What is the value of a human being without enlightenment?

00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:35.199
What is the use of having human beings if they are not enlightened?

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:38.859
What is the use of this instrument if it is not put to the mains?

00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:41.950
The rest is on useless

00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:44.980
Isn't it?

00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:51.189
And it is you who have to raise the people you have to enlighten the people

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:57.220
As we have some gas lights you see a man runs up to the gas lights ruth

00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:03.280
Lighten them he only has has the power or capacity to it. So he runs up the street

00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:11.229
Lightening all the gas lights it is he here who has to do he is appointed for that?

00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:17.859
Sahaja Yogi's must realize. What is their value?

00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:29.100
What have you made out of sahaja yoga? How many people have you saved?

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:30.760
How many people you have had?

00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:37.110
Instead of your own problems are so many and you are creating problems for others by talking by discussing by arguing

00:11:37.510 --> 00:11:39.930
You cannot discuss it out. You must know

00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:44.009
You cannot argue it out it has to work by itself

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:48.239
by arguing discussing fussing judging

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:51.880
Confusing yourself

00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:57.450
You create a problem for your Kundalini to work it out. Are you not seeking your spirit?

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:03.029
Are you not worried about the salvation of your own spirit?

00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:10.259
If so, what are you doing about it?

00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:15.930
That's the most important thing I

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:19.769
think everybody realizes this

00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:25.050
That only achieving self-realization is not the end of it

00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:34.709
Because it's just the sprouting that I started if to go further you have to have compassion for others who haven't got it as yet

00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:40.199
You have to think about them. You have to give it to them work it out put all your minds truth

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:43.020
But still I find people are busy with other things

00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:47.010
They go back into the same circle

00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:53.040
You should be busy. I don't say that should not do something for your living you have to do it

00:12:58.030 --> 00:13:02.819
This is one thing very important for us to know that we have to work it out

00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:05.400
We have to allow it to grow Within ourselves I

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.820
Mean if you say the mother we have all faith in you, that's all that's not sufficient. What Faith

00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:15.600
Do you have what do you mean by faith in such a waiter? What is faith after all?

00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:26.309
Have you ever analyzed the word faith some people think that we have all faith in mother if you sing her place finished?

00:13:30.279 --> 00:13:34.739
For that one has to reach a certain stage like adi shankaracharya had reached

00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:46.090
How do you got faith in yourself is the point who is having Faith in me?

00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:49.329
Is the one who has no faith in oneself you?

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:56.500
have to have faith in yourself and

00:13:56.900 --> 00:14:00.610
In all your fellow be all this other sahaja Yogi's

00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:03.220
I've already told you that

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:10.149
Sahaja yoga is not going to work out individually anybody who thinks that I am something later than the others is a gone case

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:20.289
Nobody should work sahaja yoga for oneself in that way you have to work collectivity for every one of them

00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:26.620
Any one of you who thinks that you have something higher than the others have you are sadly mistaken

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:33.040
It's like one eye saying that I am higher than the other or one no saying I am higher than the eyes

00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:37.420
everything has its own place in the body of Iran and

00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:40.930
everybody is so important as well as

00:14:42.650 --> 00:14:44.650
dispensable

00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:53.069
You know what happens in Sahaja, Yoga very common in India not so much here

00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:56.790
I mean Indians do this way they have certain very good points like I

00:14:57.040 --> 00:15:00.779
Mean whenever I go. I find them very much matured and very much developed

00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:06.420
Because they are not such thinkers as you are you are great thinkers visionaries intellectuals you see

00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:11.760
And I was thinking all the intellectuals will be developing a horn here like this after some time

00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:18.689
And when you see that we will know that these intellectuals who are denouncing. God and you now seeing all his way

00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:27.780
They are not intellectuals. I would say to that extent but they fail in certain things

00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:31.290
while you fail in certain things

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:40.949
They always had this kind of a thing that somebody came up like a one man. He said no

00:15:40.950 --> 00:15:43.319
I am something great you see then. He said I am this I am that

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:45.840
goes on with this kind of hopping

00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:48.900
And it shows down other people

00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:56.220
And then suddenly such a person is brought down

00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:01.710
And the people are shocked mother ha ha what happened

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:06.300
You cannot you see if you have to even pull a dead carpet like that

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:08.729
You cannot pull one side of it you have to carry the one

00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:14.009
Only one person cannot shoot off in the whole game

00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:19.540
now you take my

00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:20.890
position

00:16:20.890 --> 00:16:21.660
Yes, I know

00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:25.319
I have all the powers everything is there of course I'm supposed to be a

00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:28.379
Much higher than all that supposed to be I should say

00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:32.070
But confronting you I?

00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:39.239
Have to come down. I have to fight the way with you up the Hill

00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:49.450
Every step we have to go together hand in hand you know that

00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:58.209
Somebody some Chakras are catching all right, so I put my chakra into play it works out

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:05.770
It works out that way, but you know that how much I have to struggle

00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:11.380
How much I have to work hard

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:15.920
It's a task

00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:17.750
living realization

00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:24.070
my Kundalini doesn't need anything you know that but still she has to carry your heavy Kundalini on herself and

00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:27.520
Raise it

00:17:27.650 --> 00:17:29.650
It's a very heavy thing

00:17:33.050 --> 00:17:37.329
Only a person of real love can do that

00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:41.380
That's the only criteria

00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:43.840
The one who does not have love

00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:46.660
Cannot do it

00:17:47.090 --> 00:17:49.209
It is too much a thing to do

00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:55.810
the whole Body vibrating the every center vibrating

00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:58.480
It's not easy

00:17:58.490 --> 00:18:00.969
but it's just the love the compassion between

00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:04.150
you and me

00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:08.560
Miss suits me

00:18:12.429 --> 00:18:14.788
which covers all the

00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:18.809
tasks and the labor and the thing that I have to put in

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:25.289
And sometimes it's such a wasteful thing I feel about some people it is such a waste with them

00:18:26.110 --> 00:18:28.110
but still the love

00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:34.230
That has brought us together

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:37.200
gives that soothing feeling

00:18:38.919 --> 00:18:41.969
And you she's so cheerful every morning you get up with a new

00:18:45.669 --> 00:18:48.989
Fragrance within yourself feeling so happy about it

00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:54.870
So be careful

00:18:55.330 --> 00:18:58.230
In dealing with people you have to deal with love

00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:04.020
Not with criticism or in any way showing them down in any way

00:19:07.330 --> 00:19:12.539
When you are not any way higher than anyone, then there is no reason it should be done like that

00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:17.070
If you are getting anyway

00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:19.070
Higher you are helping the collective be

00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:24.779
But in that if you are feeling that you are higher than others you are again coming down because you are pulling down the collectivity

00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:29.549
If you put down anyone or condemn anyone like that

00:19:33.250 --> 00:19:39.359
Then you are putting down that person, and you should not also cut it because I am there to correct

00:19:43.149 --> 00:19:45.149
It's not easy to correct others

00:19:45.429 --> 00:19:49.259
You may hurt them you don't know even the ways of correcting people

00:19:50.169 --> 00:19:54.929
Unless and until you have those powerful vibrations which are emitting from your being just love

00:19:55.779 --> 00:19:57.779
Then you can do it

00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:08.159
Because of an ego, oriented society you are very good at hurting others. We dominate others

00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:17.069
We don't even know that we are dominating others. There's so many ways I've learnt in this country we have

00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:20.760
By which we dominate in a very subtle way

00:20:23.470 --> 00:20:27.270
We talked to people in such a way that we are dominating them

00:20:32.170 --> 00:20:36.269
Do we ever think sit down? How are we going to talk to others?

00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:39.540
Suggesting our love to them

00:20:40.090 --> 00:20:46.829
I'll tell you again and again that sahaja yoga is nothing, but love love love how much you love others is the main point

00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:50.820
despising

00:20:51.910 --> 00:20:53.910
Criticizing is not

00:20:54.550 --> 00:20:57.240
Yesterday you were just to say today you are better off

00:20:57.940 --> 00:21:03.659
There are going to be better off stare of course some people who are very heavy are very troublesome

00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:07.050
You should tell them plainly that sorry sir. You are very negative. We can't bear you

00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:15.330
There are some cunning people also who may come in and try to trouble you?

00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:21.899
To a point is all right then you have to tell them off. That's we are. Sorry

00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:29.010
But even to judge whether a person is negative or what sort of a thing is doing you are just thinking about it

00:21:29.010 --> 00:21:31.499
You are rationalizing not through rationality

00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:34.230
but through vibrations

00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:40.439
Because rationality a person may appear to be a very nice person may be

00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:44.969
Or a lady coming in C and the lady will be a terrible stuff

00:21:52.530 --> 00:21:56.300
So how much you meditate means how much you love?

00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:04.160
When you think of others think how much you love them just try to think how beautiful it is

00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:11.719
If it is not love it is hatred

00:22:13.410 --> 00:22:21.050
it's like a scorching heat you see which will completely take away all the beauty the smoothness of

00:22:22.679 --> 00:22:24.679
your heart

00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:34.160
Only through love Sahaja Yoga is going to split

00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:42.079
All these years you have seen the powers of hatred

00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:45.470
You have seen how people hate

00:22:46.530 --> 00:22:54.290
How they talk about each other how they treat each other there's no tenderness about them. There's no kindness about them

00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:00.080
How sharp? They are with each?

00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:12.279
You have to change all that now you have to create a world of people who love each other for nothing

00:23:14.180 --> 00:23:19.509
Not for money not for positions not for beauty not for sex

00:23:20.810 --> 00:23:22.810
only for love sex

00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:25.720
only because

00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:29.890
You have been blessed by love

00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:42.190
From next time will be advertising and there will be many more coming. Who are new people to sahaja yoga?

00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:45.099
And I'm sure it is going to increase

00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:52.450
But I have told you that all of you must find out. How many people you can bring in yourself and workout I?

00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:57.909
Must say Jim has done a good job very good job. I'm very proud of him

00:23:58.790 --> 00:24:00.790
He's gone and done such a lot of things

00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:06.190
And single-handed she has worked it out fighting such a horrible monster there

00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:08.890
But he's done it

00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:14.139
All of you must support him and also such people who want to do something?

00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:18.910
Put your mind to something like that all the time. We are thinking about jobs. This that that

00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:27.849
This is a very precious time it should not be lost all our lives you have done jobs earning money marrying having children and dying

00:24:32.690 --> 00:24:34.690
this lifetime

00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:39.249
Let us do something special for which this whole universe was created

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.560
Open the gates of heavens from the rest of the people

00:24:48.770 --> 00:24:56.410
You have to be a sidious there is no compulsion in Sahaja yoga. You know that forever. There is no timing for it

00:24:57.890 --> 00:24:59.890
There is no forcing for it

00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:05.080
Because I say it is love if you do not want to do it. Nobody is going to Force you

00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:11.859
But as I said sahaja yoga gives a very long rope to hang yourself

00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:20.990
Till you go into illusions completely, and you wouldn't even know that you have lost all your vibrations it is to that extent

00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:31.759
if we have entered into something

00:25:33.630 --> 00:25:35.630
Which was unprecedented?

00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:39.200
We have to take the ways which are unprecedented

00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:46.820
You cannot go about with the ways that you have had before you have to change your methods

00:25:51.810 --> 00:25:55.220
judge every action of yours true love

00:25:56.280 --> 00:26:03.980
How much sacrifice you can make for others what can you sacrifice for others what service? Can you do for others Sahaja Yogi's?

00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:05.980
I'm saying

00:26:06.030 --> 00:26:11.060
There is no sacrifice in it if you see it. What is the sacrifice? Which is love?

00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:18.380
If you love someone, and you want to take say the rose for a person

00:26:19.710 --> 00:26:25.520
And you go to the market with great difficulty you get the morrow's when you get it you feel happy

00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:27.860
but then you get the thorn in the

00:26:28.410 --> 00:26:35.150
Finger still you don't mind this bleeding doesn't matter then you are just waiting to see the person there

00:26:35.850 --> 00:26:39.230
And when you see the person you forget all that is

00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:42.260
gone in between

00:26:42.270 --> 00:26:44.270
And you give that Rose?

00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:46.280
Just to Express yourself

00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:48.090
symbolically

00:26:48.090 --> 00:26:54.470
And how happy you feel that you have been able to give that rose to that person this we do every day in our life

00:26:55.920 --> 00:27:02.060
But in Sahaja yoga you do it without even knowing it. It's happening

00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:11.479
You are transmitters everywhere. You are sitting in meditation. You are transmitting vibrations. Do you know that?

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:18.620
At that time if you are thinking say of your jobs and your other things which you have been taking before

00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:22.639
The transmission is poor

00:27:23.730 --> 00:27:28.789
Think of love think of the whole country think of the whole world at that time

00:27:30.559 --> 00:27:36.798
Your transmitters of these waves of love and love will play flow from you. I?

00:27:39.509 --> 00:27:43.279
Told you once that you are made in the form of Ganesha

00:27:45.629 --> 00:27:47.629
And that's what you have to do

00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:51.019
You know there are vibrations from you coming out?

00:27:53.429 --> 00:27:55.908
You are sending vibrations out you know that

00:28:01.259 --> 00:28:09.199
That means you're like any deity. Which is thrown out of the mother's I?

00:28:11.159 --> 00:28:13.609
mean Earth's womb

00:28:15.149 --> 00:28:19.878
And a big temple is raised and thousands of people go to worship that

00:28:22.619 --> 00:28:25.819
And they say it is a temple

00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:33.619
Of a jagger Delta means a person jagr root means enlightened

00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:37.100
awakened

00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:39.740
and that's just a

00:28:40.110 --> 00:28:41.909
Stone A

00:28:41.909 --> 00:28:48.169
Stone that comes out and people build a temple on top of that and go there. I worship that

00:28:50.190 --> 00:28:54.049
while there are so many already sitting here, so many jagira the

00:28:55.799 --> 00:28:57.799
realized souls

00:28:59.789 --> 00:29:01.939
These are living these are moving

00:29:06.389 --> 00:29:08.389
These are understanding

00:29:09.450 --> 00:29:11.450
They maneuver

00:29:11.850 --> 00:29:13.850
the stones only emit vibrations

00:29:14.909 --> 00:29:18.799
To clear that mosfet but you you can raise the Kundalini

00:29:19.799 --> 00:29:24.199
They cannot raise the Kundalini you can now what are revealing about it

00:29:24.779 --> 00:29:27.829
Such a precious thing you have got what are you doing about it?

00:29:30.690 --> 00:29:33.139
Is it because there is no business with it?

00:29:34.619 --> 00:29:37.129
That we are taking it so slowly

00:29:38.279 --> 00:29:41.779
Supposing it's an enterprise then everybody would be up and doing is it

00:29:42.779 --> 00:29:45.679
We have to change ways and methods of understanding

00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:49.009
The reward of God his thousandfold

00:29:50.550 --> 00:29:52.999
Then any Enterprise can Bestow Pali

00:29:56.130 --> 00:29:58.130
When he blesses you

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:04.280
He wouldn't even have words to thank him to that extent he goes

00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:11.810
Are we depending on him or on our own old ways?

00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:20.900
They have to change very much. We have to transform ourselves into new style of thinking

00:30:22.650 --> 00:30:24.650
It is very very important I

00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:33.349
Hope you will think about it what I have to talk to you today

00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:42.480
don't take

00:30:43.690 --> 00:30:45.690
to life's which

00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:47.850
Has not brought any happiness to you

00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:50.580
You have your friends?

00:30:50.679 --> 00:30:52.679
Who are sahaja Yogi's change your friends?

00:30:53.980 --> 00:30:57.419
Change your methods of life. You will enjoy a much more

00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:09.899
This is for you to understand

00:31:12.549 --> 00:31:16.139
About yourself and about the importance of Sahaja Yoga is

00:31:17.230 --> 00:31:20.130
Unless and until it is an enterprise nobody takes it up seriously

00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:22.390
this is

00:31:22.390 --> 00:31:24.390
the style of

00:31:24.909 --> 00:31:26.470
western thinking

00:31:26.470 --> 00:31:30.569
It has to be whether it is hocus-Pocus, or real Enterprise

00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:34.500
Doesn't matter as long as there is money exchanges everybody is up

00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:37.380
and doing

00:31:38.140 --> 00:31:42.539
But when it comes to sahaja yoga they have no time he went to meditate

00:31:48.470 --> 00:31:53.289
Because we are not yet loved we will not felt that Love within Ausa I

00:31:56.929 --> 00:32:02.829
Wish you could all feel that depth of love then you would go all out to

00:32:07.370 --> 00:32:09.879
work it out for yourself and for others I

00:32:12.799 --> 00:32:16.028
Would like to have some questions from you sahaja yogi's if possible

00:32:16.129 --> 00:32:19.059
And somebody should try to give him he can get it in no time

00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:21.879
realization I say at the king of mysteries

00:32:27.139 --> 00:32:33.399
Is there any question ask me anything practical because we have very few new people today

00:32:33.399 --> 00:32:35.709
We can just have a very nice chat

00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:59.289
In front of me will you do to the queen no no no what I'm saying will you do to the queen of England fitra?

00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:02.860
Yeah

00:33:04.340 --> 00:33:06.110
before my photograph

00:33:06.110 --> 00:33:08.110
will you spit at the

00:33:08.179 --> 00:33:12.878
No, no, no what I'm saying if your if your queen's photograph is there will you spit at her?

00:33:14.539 --> 00:33:19.898
Yes, it is. It is an insult putting your feet towards somebody is an insult is a common thing

00:33:22.759 --> 00:33:23.289
No, no

00:33:23.289 --> 00:33:25.289
It is a custom everywhere in the whole world

00:33:25.549 --> 00:33:27.549
We have you have lost all your traditions

00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:33.249
Doesn't mean that there were no such traditions of putting away free turn somebody imagine somebody coming down to see you

00:33:33.529 --> 00:33:38.949
Somebody who you have to respect you put your feet up. I mean anybody can understand you when a child understands this

00:33:40.279 --> 00:33:44.529
You see the sense of our respect has come to us from inside not from outside

00:33:45.019 --> 00:33:48.939
It's not rationality it has come to us from over unconscious

00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:51.409
We know how we respect?

00:33:51.409 --> 00:33:54.549
Say somebody would say that what's wrong in talking like this to someone

00:33:55.280 --> 00:34:01.759
You see supposing somebody says now you know that even a child knows if he's talking to elders. He'd put down his head

00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:05.180
but here you see everybody so abnormal you don't know how to

00:34:06.090 --> 00:34:11.569
Do everything because everything is rationalized you see tomorrow you might say what's wrong if I stand on my head

00:34:11.570 --> 00:34:15.919
I mean do it but that's not the way there are certain normal ways of

00:34:16.679 --> 00:34:22.158
Protocol of praying how do you pray in the church imagine in the church you go and sit with both your feet towards the priest?

00:34:22.350 --> 00:34:24.350
What will you say put on your feet?

00:34:24.690 --> 00:34:28.640
These things are innate within us human beings are already lots of things

00:34:31.890 --> 00:34:33.750
They're not animals

00:34:33.750 --> 00:34:39.770
they know lots of things already you don't know how many things are built in you in a very beautiful way in your

00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:44.330
Understanding as a human being you know so many things

00:34:46.530 --> 00:34:52.280
Nowhere in the world you will find anybody putting up their feet before anyone whom you respect. It's not a sign of respect

00:34:54.720 --> 00:35:00.530
There's no question of India or anything only thing in India people have yet preserved all their sense of respect

00:35:02.580 --> 00:35:08.179
In other places they have so rationalized and so you go in orientate that they have no respect for anyone, what sir?

00:35:19.270 --> 00:35:22.349
And then it's alright, it happened. Did you see it?

00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:30.840
No, no, no, not that way not losing energy

00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:36.989
I was just thinking about stressing the feet before somebody whom you respect say my photograph is there or I'm there now

00:35:36.990 --> 00:35:40.020
You respect me isn't it then you would not like to sit with the feet

00:35:40.090 --> 00:35:45.629
That's what I'm trying to say, but you see losing energy or now that is not that at all who told me

00:35:45.630 --> 00:35:48.480
That's not you sleep like that. You don't sleep with the feet on the ground

00:35:49.810 --> 00:35:53.129
How can it be if anybody says that you should not take it for granted?

00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:57.659
It's a they say I think that all this is not so important to us

00:35:59.170 --> 00:36:04.590
When you see, how do you sleep? I mean it is so simple and natural you know this is what happening with rationality?

00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:08.939
See very simple things become so funny that you I don't know what to say

00:36:09.099 --> 00:36:14.369
That's what I said a horn will be growing from your all you of you intellectuals will be having a big on coming out

00:36:14.369 --> 00:36:16.709
So people will know right all right. We know these people

00:36:17.290 --> 00:36:19.290
But nobody will face them

00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:21.510
You see it is so simple

00:36:22.060 --> 00:36:23.740
Because they are so complicated

00:36:23.740 --> 00:36:30.359
All simple things look so hot it is a question of respect and he's a question of if you are sleeping of course you stretch

00:36:30.359 --> 00:36:34.799
Your feet like that straight his call right while you sit down. You can sit like that. There's no, huh?

00:36:35.890 --> 00:36:40.830
You need not be cross-legged all the time. It's not necessary if you are doing some sort of a

00:36:41.470 --> 00:36:43.470
Exercises something you can be like that

00:36:44.650 --> 00:36:48.750
But everything now say for example you have got hands now

00:36:48.750 --> 00:36:52.320
This is for many purposes all right it is for taking vibrations

00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:58.439
It is for eating it is for scratching now. If you are eating at that time if you want to scratch now what to do

00:36:58.990 --> 00:37:00.760
It's a question like that

00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:04.739
See whatever you have to do you do at that right time with the way you want to do

00:37:07.150 --> 00:37:12.570
If you need your feet for something you running you should run when you have to sit down

00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:17.279
Then you have to sleep you ever sleep. I mean this is normal

00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:21.810
Sahaja Yogi's does not mean that you should cut your noses

00:37:22.780 --> 00:37:24.780
No, it doesn't mean that

00:37:50.330 --> 00:37:52.330
and

00:38:36.020 --> 00:38:40.420
I see this which I casted in a very

00:38:52.550 --> 00:38:54.999
short time and

00:38:56.270 --> 00:38:58.270
This was like

00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:00.280
because and

00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:04.690
Then I find that from the height high something. I have come so I

00:39:05.750 --> 00:39:07.750
Feel it

00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:12.579
and I have found that the more I detach myself from

00:39:13.970 --> 00:39:16.329
my family from my

00:39:18.410 --> 00:39:23.410
things he's my gravy and biggest number of

00:39:25.820 --> 00:39:27.820
medication

00:39:30.890 --> 00:39:32.890
comes to this

00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:35.500
one

00:39:36.150 --> 00:39:39.379
When I see a beautiful the beautiful name I

00:39:41.279 --> 00:39:43.579
would remain restless grass for

00:39:51.390 --> 00:39:57.200
Whatever isis what you're doing. No, I'm just

00:39:59.819 --> 00:40:03.498
What was that you did what yoga did you do?

00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:13.880
Haha, yeah, all right

00:40:26.029 --> 00:40:32.209
It's to myself to maintain that state of mind which useful offer please

00:40:43.890 --> 00:40:49.219
Yes, just corrected all right now the first thing very supporters are catching

00:40:50.549 --> 00:40:52.529
That's it

00:40:52.529 --> 00:40:56.449
Now see to do patanjali was a mistake

00:40:57.150 --> 00:41:00.889
The very beginning as a mother I must tell you frankly all right

00:41:01.410 --> 00:41:08.960
Because patanjali cannot be done unless and until you have some realize guru behind it if you start doing it is unauthorized

00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:14.719
See it is an unauthorized thing to do like supposing

00:41:15.420 --> 00:41:17.509
I am not as a policeman

00:41:18.359 --> 00:41:21.679
All right, and I start behaving like a policeman

00:41:22.319 --> 00:41:23.849
I'll be arrested

00:41:23.849 --> 00:41:26.419
in the same way you did it in an unauthorized a

00:41:27.299 --> 00:41:30.528
By doing in an unauthorized way you see you have

00:41:31.589 --> 00:41:34.189
started in the wrong Direction altogether

00:41:34.979 --> 00:41:42.139
The Direction was wrong and the bliss and all that you get it is not the bliss that we are talking about

00:41:43.170 --> 00:41:46.819
That's a bliss one gets when you see shirk responsibility you can get

00:41:48.460 --> 00:41:51.629
You see if you can get out of your family and children and all that

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:56.250
one can feel blissful if he thinks that it is having a sort of a

00:41:58.809 --> 00:42:01.349
pressure on you or a kind of a

00:42:02.079 --> 00:42:04.229
attachment or something but

00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:06.960
in Sahaja Yoga, what happens is

00:42:08.049 --> 00:42:10.949
That you become a personality

00:42:11.650 --> 00:42:14.879
When you are in the drama, but you are just seeing it

00:42:15.609 --> 00:42:17.609
You become as action

00:42:18.609 --> 00:42:20.609
That should happen

00:42:20.829 --> 00:42:26.519
That's the reality that's how it should happen once it happens to you, then you will just start seeing the whole thing as a trauma

00:42:27.819 --> 00:42:29.819
You understand

00:42:31.599 --> 00:42:33.869
Chi, Wanta what is she say?

00:42:36.460 --> 00:42:38.460
Huh?

00:42:41.710 --> 00:42:46.649
He is waiting. Yes. He is a realized soul. We'll see what realization

00:42:49.150 --> 00:42:55.079
You got it. What about this gentleman here in front of you Marcus

00:43:01.050 --> 00:43:03.529
So it should happen in the most

00:43:05.490 --> 00:43:08.209
natural way in a spontaneous way and

00:43:08.730 --> 00:43:15.469
God has given you that ancora. Which is called as Kundalini. Which of course you know Camila and all these people have talked about

00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:21.979
But it is a sahaja method it just happens to you with a realized soul only you cannot do it yourself

00:43:22.410 --> 00:43:27.379
If you try to do it, you will be making a mistake, and that's what has happened in you

00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:32.569
So now we have to completely sort of neutralize the effects of that

00:43:32.570 --> 00:43:38.600
And then we'll raise your Kundalini by which you will get your realization by which gradually we'll get your vibrations

00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:40.560
And you start understanding all right?

00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:46.610
So you just now forget about that what you have done it, and it's going to work out then it's a permanent thing

00:43:47.340 --> 00:43:49.340
Hmm

00:43:49.890 --> 00:43:51.890
What about his vibration Marcus?

00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:55.789
Huh left or right you?

00:43:58.050 --> 00:44:00.050
Got your realization is it

00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:04.010
I'm asking you is it all right?

00:44:05.700 --> 00:44:08.000
Where's the catch on the left is it are you feeling something?

00:44:10.410 --> 00:44:12.410
You get what?

00:44:13.500 --> 00:44:15.500
ha ha

00:44:15.750 --> 00:44:22.010
Anybody was any problems about Chakras any one of the sahaja Yogi's Cooley. We have some water

00:44:24.990 --> 00:44:26.990
anybody Perhaps

00:44:27.180 --> 00:44:32.450
Anybody who has any problem about their own Chakras please ask me you see because - next time

00:44:32.450 --> 00:44:36.740
We'll be having lots of people here, and then we won't be able to talk so better ask me about it

00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:40.880
Dinesh, what is your problem?

00:44:44.010 --> 00:44:50.479
Again, I can see that clearly from here you have to forgive people. Do you understand that?

00:44:54.780 --> 00:44:56.780
forgive and forgive

00:45:02.220 --> 00:45:06.049
What about her vibrations don't you see?

00:45:12.869 --> 00:45:17.809
You have not been alright, but have you been practicing

00:45:21.599 --> 00:45:23.599
Why?

00:45:25.140 --> 00:45:29.780
Now what have you been practicing did you take vibrations and did you clearance yourself a?

00:45:33.630 --> 00:45:35.630
footbath you'd

00:45:37.470 --> 00:45:45.470
Anytime everything is better. So what is it then what you are not feeling anything in your heart

00:45:48.119 --> 00:45:50.179
In which fingers are you feeling the tingling?

00:45:52.740 --> 00:45:54.740
most of them oh, God

00:45:56.310 --> 00:45:58.310
Where have you been before coming to me?

00:46:00.150 --> 00:46:02.150
to what group you be

00:46:06.340 --> 00:46:08.340
Hmm. What does he do?

00:46:11.950 --> 00:46:13.950
What does he see?

00:46:17.650 --> 00:46:21.239
Zen, but he's not a realized soul you

00:46:22.510 --> 00:46:29.429
See this israel. What else am I teaching here? Do you realize sahaja yoga is nothing else, but zen simple zen

00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:40.260
Unless and until you are realized how are you going to see into the original are you going to penetrate into that?

00:46:42.490 --> 00:46:44.490
This is simple Zen I am telling

00:46:47.710 --> 00:46:51.060
So what is he doing here your friend?

00:46:54.190 --> 00:46:56.190
Here's what a class or something

00:46:58.390 --> 00:47:00.390
So what?

00:47:03.310 --> 00:47:08.039
What is my self writing without understanding you cannot Copy zen?

00:47:10.930 --> 00:47:12.930
You have to be there

00:47:13.780 --> 00:47:15.780
See there were only

00:47:16.030 --> 00:47:23.519
26 Kasha pass in the six centuries there Kashyap as means realized souls you say in the same system, so far

00:47:24.370 --> 00:47:26.370
And now we have so many of them here

00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:34.860
So this is then nothing else present you must understand

00:47:39.130 --> 00:47:42.960
You tell him to come and see me sometimes you see this is all artificial

00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:46.949
You cannot copy people you have to get it. You understand my point

00:47:51.819 --> 00:47:53.819
What is it?

00:47:56.079 --> 00:47:58.079
Yes, you have been

00:48:00.309 --> 00:48:02.489
Know that that's true, but what I'm saying that

00:48:03.910 --> 00:48:10.649
For that you should take your treatment all right. We have some treatments here. Do you know what we give for that?

00:48:12.010 --> 00:48:15.389
Yes, did you bring that you did once?

00:48:18.279 --> 00:48:23.009
All right now both the hands you are getting the tingling or one hand

up here coach tingling or I had my era no, but that's

00:48:35.170 --> 00:48:42.720
It will be gradually be settling down see it has to settle down within you he's come with you is it

00:48:47.290 --> 00:48:51.599
Connor just sees vibrations. You said see yourself. You'll be good right here hmM

Abdel Fattah Jacobus

Pasado, how did you know it? Did you write to your father and find out how it's all these vibrations

00:51:00.849 --> 00:51:06.989
You see what he was. So sweet. He told me will you tell you a finish that I have got my world realization, so

00:51:07.840 --> 00:51:09.840
You write to him back saying that

00:51:11.619 --> 00:51:17.039
Mataji has told me. I am very happy about it now how to maintain it you send a photograph and take interest

00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:19.040
He'd be very happy you

00:51:21.820 --> 00:51:27.509
Know he told me that he wanted to go to religious life we went to

00:51:29.530 --> 00:51:32.699
Him allah has also wanted to take Sannyasa and undertake

00:51:39.030 --> 00:51:40.800
This is Athena

00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:46.340
Let's tell him to change his pattern a little bit into alright sweaty food otherwise a very good person

00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:49.520
Good man

00:52:00.930 --> 00:52:05.780
Right sorry sir ah you see this working means you have to understand just imagine

00:52:14.080 --> 00:52:19.529
They also went to this dream when he didn't believe in attitude

00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:25.410
But maybe because of Kandahar Jeremy you were abandoned

00:52:30.760 --> 00:52:34.090
I don't know how they may discover that it was all wrong

00:52:36.980 --> 00:52:38.980
very sensible

00:52:40.700 --> 00:52:47.380
Never be very very discriminating. I mean honestly they are so much impressed by her just can't talk to him

00:52:51.290 --> 00:52:54.159
Then what they told me about her that she just talks about

00:52:54.800 --> 00:52:58.810
Something abstract. She didn't talk about science nothing, so that's why we like her

00:52:59.420 --> 00:53:02.830
absolute is it if the divine is not related to

00:53:04.610 --> 00:53:06.610
Life, what's the use of such a diviner?

00:53:16.369 --> 00:53:18.369
Hmm

00:53:23.019 --> 00:53:25.019
right a lot

00:53:26.529 --> 00:53:32.099
What do you feel guilty about now? Just don't feel in here right now

00:53:48.030 --> 00:53:51.890
Well you better now. What is her done? Less you see a vibration

00:53:58.950 --> 00:54:05.929
Left you been to some spiritualist. No sure

Put your right hand on your heart right hand on your heart is
