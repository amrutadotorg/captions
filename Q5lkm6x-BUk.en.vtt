00:10.753 --> 00:11.003
Public Program The Nabhi Chakra

00:11.110 --> 00:11.360
New Delhi – India January 31, 1983

00:11.452 --> 00:17.583
The music was very fine and elevating to all of you.

00:20.782 --> 00:24.105
The effect of music in Sahaja Yoga is tremendous,

00:25.071 --> 00:27.493
and if a Sahaja Yogi sings the song

00:27.537 --> 00:28.993
it's so great that it acts like a mantra upon My being.

00:29.060 --> 00:33.549
So I'm very thankful to Mrs. Venogopalan

00:34.770 --> 00:38.704
for singing such a beautiful song today. It stirred Me completely.

00:40.160 --> 00:46.438
Then Gavin Brown was very sweet. He's an Englishman, very gentle

00:46.804 --> 00:48.772
and a very steady Sahaja Yogi.

00:50.126 --> 00:53.782
He's one of the first Western Sahaja Yogis

00:54.754 --> 00:55.782
I met.

00:59.400 --> 01:04.960
Today I will tell you about the Nabhi Chakra which deals

01:05.209 --> 01:07.890
with this honesty of seeking.

01:11.000 --> 01:15.850
Nabhi Chakra is the center which controls

01:16.805 --> 01:20.591
or manifests outside in the gross as

01:22.874 --> 01:30.539
Solar Plexus. Nabhi Chakra has two sides: one is the left,

01:30.799 --> 01:34.594
another the right, and one in the center.

01:37.281 --> 01:40.365
So on the left hand side is the Gruha Lakshmi,

01:41.291 --> 01:43.401
on the right hand side is the Raja Lakshmi

01:43.446 --> 01:48.138
or Gaja Lakshmi and in the center is the Lakshmi

01:48.317 --> 01:50.553
which ascends into Mahalakshmi.

01:59.160 --> 02:08.767
When the seeking starts, a human being

02:09.394 --> 02:13.091
first starts seeking food.

02:15.449 --> 02:21.196
Food is very important for all the animals. If they have no food

02:25.803 --> 02:32.615
then they cannot exist. So the seeking starts

02:33.446 --> 02:40.816
with food, and when the shelter is sought, they try to find the water.

02:48.344 --> 02:51.958
So this center is made of water

02:56.283 --> 03:05.521
and in this center resides the Deity of Shri Vishnu or Narayana;

03:10.867 --> 03:18.272
and His power, as I told you, is Lakshmi and then Mahalakshmi.

03:20.549 --> 03:22.549
You will find out in Sahaja Yoga

03:23.788 --> 03:30.788
that gradually you start developing one power and then the other.

03:32.609 --> 03:36.661
Everyone who comes to Sahaja Yoga, if they are truthful

03:37.735 --> 03:41.851
and not involved with any wrong things,

03:43.691 --> 03:47.501
then definitely they are helped in Lakshmi Tattwa,

03:47.841 --> 03:50.802
means their well-being is looked after.

03:51.021 --> 03:54.309
As Krishna has said, "yogakshema vahaamya."

03:55.164 --> 03:58.514
So He looks after the kshema part of it.

03:59.112 --> 04:02.006
Everyone who has been to Sahaja Yoga

04:02.224 --> 04:04.224
has been helped miraculously

04:04.475 --> 04:07.781
also in the Lakshmi Tattwa, that means materially.

04:09.192 --> 04:11.152
In so many ways they are helped,

04:11.333 --> 04:13.333
that one has to just see for themselves

04:13.797 --> 04:16.417
how these miracles take place.

04:17.329 --> 04:26.277
An example is of a villager who had a small little holding of land

04:27.499 --> 04:33.330
and he was living hand to mouth every day.

04:34.724 --> 04:38.489
When he came to Me, after some time I found

04:38.612 --> 04:40.555
he would bring one garland,

04:40.607 --> 04:42.999
big garland, for Me every evening.

04:43.443 --> 04:46.656
And he was away in the village every day he would attend My program.

04:47.779 --> 04:53.071
I was quite surprised that how could he afford it, and I asked him,

04:53.517 --> 04:57.275
"How can you afford a garland for Me every day?

04:57.356 --> 04:59.030
You shouldn't bring it, it's not proper."

05:01.113 --> 05:02.819
So he said, "Mother, You know everything."

05:03.176 --> 05:04.663
I said, "Why, what happened?"

05:04.803 --> 05:10.737
He said, "I have a plot of land next to mine

05:10.796 --> 05:14.292
which we never used because it was absolutely a barren land -

05:14.420 --> 05:19.327
little bit, not much big land, but a small land, piece of land.

05:20.873 --> 05:24.038
And after Realization I used to always go

05:24.462 --> 05:27.753
walk over it bare feet to plough this little

05:28.047 --> 05:29.789
piece of land that I had.

05:31.386 --> 05:35.231
After some time when I was coming here after that,

05:35.734 --> 05:38.801
one gentleman came to see me and he said that

05:39.395 --> 05:41.780
“This piece of land that you have is very precious.“

05:42.759 --> 05:45.840
He said, “What's the problem?” He said that

05:45.978 --> 05:54.084
“I have a kiln of bricks, and I have seen that even

05:54.615 --> 06:02.764
by chance – Sahaja - we mixed a little clay from this soil,

06:02.847 --> 06:07.637
from this part of the land that you have,

06:07.990 --> 06:12.652
and we found that our bricks have become so good and so strong

06:13.252 --> 06:14.843
that we would like to purchase

06:15.039 --> 06:19.508
this clay from you at the price of seers."

06:21.158 --> 06:23.773
And that's how he started getting money sufficient

06:23.830 --> 06:29.905
for him and he became much better off.

06:30.692 --> 06:34.580
But in Sahaja Yoga one has to remember you don't go to extremes,

06:34.970 --> 06:36.529
in any principle.

06:36.675 --> 06:40.141
That is one thing people should know, that you don't go to extremes.

06:41.717 --> 06:44.032
You don't become extremely rich.

06:45.461 --> 06:48.489
I've seen those people who are extremely rich,

06:48.519 --> 06:50.633
when they come to Sahaja Yoga, they are a big headache,

06:51.168 --> 06:54.309
very big headache. If they are sick,

06:54.511 --> 06:57.079
if you cure them of their heart trouble,

06:58.617 --> 07:00.445
then they try to possess you.

07:01.199 --> 07:03.566
They will get all the heart patients, they will get

07:03.608 --> 07:05.219
all kinds of patients to you,

07:05.476 --> 07:08.217
you go on tolerating it, they try to possess you.

07:08.495 --> 07:10.743
They immediately start talking about their cures

07:10.776 --> 07:13.292
to everyone, they publish in papers, this thing, that thing,

07:13.688 --> 07:17.437
it's impossible. And they just try to overpower you.

07:17.542 --> 07:18.632
Without any appointment

07:18.650 --> 07:21.610
they'll arrive and they would expect you to attend to them immediately,

07:21.630 --> 07:22.637
it's terrible.

07:26.450 --> 07:29.277
And then they’ll send all their relations for cure

07:30.735 --> 07:32.479
and you have to show all patience,

07:32.617 --> 07:34.740
all their friends, they become like agents.

07:36.245 --> 07:41.567
All their patients, all their relations, all their friends,

07:42.371 --> 07:45.825
they want to oblige them and spare

07:46.116 --> 07:49.054
no love, no affection, nothing further.

07:51.641 --> 07:54.818
The Sahaja Yogis, if they try

07:55.068 --> 07:57.509
to say that “No, you shouldn't do like that and all that,"

07:57.948 --> 07:59.026
they feel insulted.

08:01.166 --> 08:03.703
And they all try curing much faster

08:05.575 --> 08:07.096
than anybody else does.

08:07.300 --> 08:08.361
They themselves are weak,

08:08.440 --> 08:09.875
they are sick people themselves,

08:10.362 --> 08:12.072
heart patient, this patient, that,

08:12.216 --> 08:14.280
but if you tell them, “Don't cure,” they'll feel bad.

08:15.125 --> 08:16.038
If you don't tell them,

08:16.074 --> 08:17.817
they'll get sick and you'll have another problem.

08:18.821 --> 08:21.616
They never try to understand Sahaja Yoga in it's big way.

08:22.173 --> 08:29.446
They just want to see it according to their own way of ego

08:29.993 --> 08:32.922
that they have accumulated with their money,

08:34.066 --> 08:37.154
and they never know how they go on hurting

08:37.606 --> 08:43.557
everyone by overpowering Me all the time.

08:44.011 --> 08:48.052
It's very amazing, whenever I cure a rich man,

08:48.211 --> 08:51.247
I've been wanting to run away from that person.

08:51.359 --> 08:54.656
I would never go to their house, I would not like to eat in their house.

08:54.819 --> 08:56.547
It's a very bad thing.

08:59.187 --> 09:03.822
So too much of riches is also not okay

09:04.230 --> 09:07.246
because it gives you a tremendous

09:07.618 --> 09:09.380
ego that you don't see yourself,

09:09.383 --> 09:12.056
and anybody tries to say anything protect oneself,

09:12.144 --> 09:15.837
then such a person feels insulted or humiliated.

09:16.586 --> 09:21.307
Not only that, but they try to hold Me and hold the whole thing

09:21.388 --> 09:25.926
according to their business ways which is impossible.

09:26.295 --> 09:27.771
See, they have to gain money,

09:27.924 --> 09:31.285
they have another attitude because they are miserly.

09:31.400 --> 09:33.378
I don't have to earn money or anything.

09:33.700 --> 09:35.768
If I am doing anything, I’m, really,

09:35.887 --> 09:37.887
in a way, I'm obliging. Isn't it?

09:39.028 --> 09:42.447
But they will force on Me all their rules and regulations, everything,

09:42.477 --> 09:44.197
without having their own discipline.

09:44.948 --> 09:47.751
So very rich people in Sahaja Yoga

09:48.022 --> 09:52.313
so far have been extremely troublesome,

09:52.369 --> 09:55.736
I should say, to Me and to the whole organization.

09:55.834 --> 09:57.834
They are very narrow-minded.

09:58.363 --> 10:02.993
They cannot see the big vision that I have before Me.

10:04.324 --> 10:08.124
Whatever little ideas they have about themselves and about their

10:08.290 --> 10:12.028
own thinking, reading, they will try to push onto Sahaja Yoga.

10:12.903 --> 10:15.574
It's not My experience once, but many a times.

10:15.761 --> 10:19.686
Then somehow or other it so happens that they drop out.

10:21.080 --> 10:25.030
So, too much richness gives you a tremendous ego, worse than

10:25.429 --> 10:28.042
even, I would say, a bulldog.

10:29.260 --> 10:32.520
It’s impossible for a rich man to see

10:32.741 --> 10:37.221
that all these riches are outside him. They are not inside him.

10:38.150 --> 10:42.896
He has to be rich in heart to understand compassion.

10:43.005 --> 10:46.357
Compassion doesn't mean that you give alms to others,

10:46.542 --> 10:49.298
or if you give money to others, it's not that.

10:50.314 --> 10:53.143
On the contrary, you just have beggars by doing that.

10:55.074 --> 10:57.074
Compassion is that works,

10:59.279 --> 11:01.531
compassion is that flows,

11:02.956 --> 11:05.379
compassion is that manifests.

11:05.929 --> 11:09.661
It is not in compassion where you can make it materialize it,

11:09.690 --> 11:11.575
“All right, come along I'll give you a hundred rupees.”

11:13.201 --> 11:16.594
On the contrary, giving somebody a hundred rupees is the worst thing.

11:18.056 --> 11:20.965
I have tried this with some Sahaja Yogis who were with Me.

11:21.657 --> 11:25.132
I tried to give them some money some time as they were very poor.

11:25.333 --> 11:27.209
They became horrid.

11:29.868 --> 11:33.306
Some of them started drinking,

11:33.418 --> 11:35.787
some of them took to some other ways and they became

11:35.800 --> 11:38.386
sort of addicted to money. It was impossible.

11:38.594 --> 11:41.436
And they tried to spoil as many Sahaj Yogis as they could.

11:44.785 --> 11:48.873
So such people if they come, it's impossible to manage them.

11:50.547 --> 11:53.386
They are not Sahaja Yogis because they are asahaja.

11:53.543 --> 11:57.093
They are still sticking to the idea that they have so much money,

11:57.140 --> 12:01.660
that they are so rich and they can overpower everyone with money.

12:01.770 --> 12:03.770
Not Me, I'm sorry.

12:07.438 --> 12:14.842
But only thing I feel sorry for them that they cannot get to God.

12:15.566 --> 12:21.436
There is no honesty of seeking in them, there is no honesty of seeking.

12:22.337 --> 12:25.465
The elite people whom I have addressed

12:25.481 --> 12:27.713
so many places like this, because

12:28.063 --> 12:32.190
some people whom I have cured wanted Me to address the elite,

12:32.210 --> 12:36.763
so-called. I think they are elated, to Me what they are.

12:36.862 --> 12:39.905
They don't want to be in Sahaja Yoga.

12:40.038 --> 12:42.387
They are already eliminated, I sometimes feel.

12:42.464 --> 12:46.413
Thousands of them I've addressed, I've wasted My time with them.

12:46.570 --> 12:50.462
They are good for nothing, absolutely empty people.

12:54.029 --> 12:56.447
They are very happy because they have a few cars,

12:56.459 --> 12:58.459
or some houses or something like that.

12:59.370 --> 13:04.207
I too have all these things, I would say so-called riches.

13:04.304 --> 13:07.535
I have always seen from My father's side

13:07.723 --> 13:09.530
and from My husband's side.

13:09.840 --> 13:13.662
I don't understand what is there to be proud of this emptiness.

13:13.890 --> 13:19.650
But human beings are such, a empty vessel makes a big sound,

13:20.293 --> 13:24.870
in the same way, an empty rich man makes a very big sound.

13:29.762 --> 13:33.970
Not that the very poor are also good,

13:34.618 --> 13:36.618
because those who are extremely poor

13:37.760 --> 13:40.160
are busy with their food problems.

13:40.390 --> 13:43.596
They have little, little problems and their values are still have to

13:43.620 --> 13:44.941
come up to a point.

13:45.316 --> 13:48.720
It's only in the middle you can work out Sahaja Yoga better.

13:49.952 --> 13:52.400
Those who are extremely rich and proud

13:52.583 --> 13:55.425
cannot come to Sahaja Yoga easily.

13:55.602 --> 13:58.495
Those who are very poor also cannot come to Sahaja Yoga.

13:59.026 --> 14:05.333
But when this middle part of the river is enriched

14:05.520 --> 14:08.162
and starts flowing well, then it spreads on the sides

14:08.211 --> 14:09.777
and then it can engulf.

14:09.978 --> 14:12.721
But you cannot  start it the other way round. I have tried.

14:13.031 --> 14:14.270
I have tried both ways

14:14.580 --> 14:15.932
and I have told you what happened.

14:16.058 --> 14:17.303
Whom I gave money,

14:17.909 --> 14:19.909
whom I tried to help through giving money

14:20.582 --> 14:23.837
became wayward, useless, frivolous people,

14:24.387 --> 14:29.853
got lost to Sahaja Yoga. And those whom I thought

14:29.871 --> 14:31.925
were moneyed and satisfied people

14:32.269 --> 14:36.395
had another role to play is to possess Me all the time,

14:36.625 --> 14:39.028
to use Me all the time whenever they wanted,

14:39.446 --> 14:42.968
for whatever purpose they wanted to use Me.

14:46.000 --> 14:50.105
And they must know, you cannot possess Me, you cannot possess Me,

14:51.642 --> 14:53.354
but this kind of an ignorance

14:53.384 --> 14:55.691
still in their minds is that they can possess God,

14:55.701 --> 14:56.861
they can possess everyone.

14:58.998 --> 15:05.113
For such people there are no reasons

15:06.175 --> 15:08.175
to come to Sahaja Yoga, to be very frank.

15:08.932 --> 15:10.956
And even if they come to Sahaja Yog

15:11.926 --> 15:16.234
they have to know that for Mother richness of heart,

15:16.793 --> 15:18.793
understanding of Sahaja Yoga,

15:19.390 --> 15:23.546
humility, non-possessiveness are very important.

15:28.664 --> 15:37.726
In this ascent of yours, money is not important at all.

15:38.838 --> 15:41.802
Even if you are poor or rich, you get your Realization.

15:42.215 --> 15:47.376
For example, I went to Maharashtra, most of them are,

15:48.610 --> 15:51.507
I would say, very poor people

15:51.686 --> 15:52.926
in the sense that

15:53.180 --> 15:56.187
they are not middle class at all. They are not educated,

15:56.850 --> 16:00.128
they are sometimes factory workers

16:00.434 --> 16:05.450
or they have small holdings. Not very rich.

16:06.657 --> 16:09.831
But they are very good Sahaja Yogis, excellent Sahaja Yogis.

16:10.523 --> 16:13.368
They have such beautiful eyes

16:13.677 --> 16:17.388
and such beautiful feeling and such compassion

16:18.364 --> 16:25.002
that Lakshmi Tattwa is absolutely balanced in them.

16:26.442 --> 16:30.171
You know that Lakshmi is shown to be a lady,

16:31.075 --> 16:34.391
and lady who is a mother.

16:35.260 --> 16:38.344
Mother doesn't care whether you are rich or poor.

16:39.130 --> 16:42.401
If her one son is rich and another is poor,

16:42.675 --> 16:46.284
she'll pay more attention to the poor and ask the rich

16:46.407 --> 16:48.761
to give his money to the poor also.

16:49.425 --> 16:52.827
She is not bothered. If somebody is in need,

16:53.017 --> 16:55.482
she will be the first to help the person who needs.

16:56.460 --> 17:00.146
Now this is a spiritual thing in the spiritual life.

17:01.136 --> 17:03.136
The person who is a real seeker,

17:03.240 --> 17:07.198
who is a truthful seeker, the Mother will go out of the way

17:09.635 --> 17:13.523
to be with that person. And those who are not honest about it,

17:14.172 --> 17:16.726
Mother will try somehow or other cut them short.

17:22.544 --> 17:27.686
The problem that lies with human beings is

17:28.243 --> 17:30.743
that they do not know what they want.

17:32.386 --> 17:34.703
They think they want first of all money.

17:35.729 --> 17:37.276
But those who have money,

17:37.546 --> 17:38.971
they think they must have power.

17:39.207 --> 17:41.746
If they have too much money, they think that they must go into politics

17:42.172 --> 17:43.874
because they have had no power.

17:44.470 --> 17:47.961
Then they fail in politics, or say they become too much in politics,

17:48.010 --> 17:52.807
whatever it is, then they want love from their children

17:53.003 --> 17:56.320
which they can't get, because they are too busy or something like that.

17:58.510 --> 17:59.916
So they don't know what they want.

18:02.376 --> 18:05.835
Those who believe that by having money will be better off,

18:05.984 --> 18:08.967
should listen to all these people who have come from affluent countries

18:08.996 --> 18:09.995
and they will tell you

18:10.258 --> 18:12.024
how things have gone wrong there,

18:12.095 --> 18:14.545
how people are ruined, what's going wrong with them,

18:14.649 --> 18:17.209
absolutely they are in a bad shape.

18:19.324 --> 18:21.606
You cannot call them human beings

18:22.011 --> 18:25.155
because they are so cruel, they kill even their own children,

18:25.463 --> 18:27.546
and that society tolerates such people.

18:28.363 --> 18:30.300
In India if you hear somebody

18:30.541 --> 18:31.202
killing a child,

18:31.232 --> 18:34.196
I have never heard so far in the sixty years of My life,

18:34.578 --> 18:38.677
but supposing you hear someone has killed his daughter or son,

18:38.857 --> 18:41.245
nobody will ever look at that person.

18:41.261 --> 18:44.279
He will not be allowed in the society, nobody will even

18:44.394 --> 18:49.267
give any girl in the marriage to

18:49.812 --> 18:53.584
his daughter or a son. He'll be absolutely barred from the society.

18:54.635 --> 18:58.691
No one can think of such a relationship between children and parents.

18:59.790 --> 19:01.996
And then there are funny relationships also,

19:02.316 --> 19:03.788
it's something so absurd,

19:04.028 --> 19:07.331
on both the sides on cruelty and on morality,

19:07.419 --> 19:10.757
they are so absurd, it's impossible to understand.

19:11.513 --> 19:15.235
So money has given this ego and they say, “What's wrong?

19:16.796 --> 19:20.111
What’s wrong?” It's absolutely malignant attitude.

19:20.563 --> 19:22.226
When you say, “What's wrong?” that means

19:22.600 --> 19:25.266
you do not want to keep your relationship with the whole.

19:27.279 --> 19:29.543
You do not want to keep your relationship

19:29.956 --> 19:37.522
with the Primordial One, the One who has you,

19:38.070 --> 19:42.148
everyone within Himself. You are part and parcel of the whole,

19:42.296 --> 19:43.970
and how can you say, “What's wrong?

19:44.079 --> 19:47.842
I do what I like.” You just become like a malignant cell.

19:50.362 --> 19:53.515
So at the Nabhi Chakra one has to know

19:53.979 --> 19:57.683
that one should not hanker after money too much.

19:58.979 --> 20:01.568
Now those who hanker too much after money,

20:03.364 --> 20:09.699
may develop their right side better, they may have money, no doubt.

20:10.665 --> 20:15.054
But they miss their left side. Left side is Gruha Lakshmi,

20:16.254 --> 20:18.260
they have no Gruha Lakshmi in their house.

20:18.565 --> 20:21.483
They are very hectic people, they run about,

20:21.570 --> 20:24.368
they run the rat race, they get heart attacks,

20:24.669 --> 20:27.953
if not heart attacks, they will get leukemia,

20:28.329 --> 20:32.619
they'll get diabetes, liver, all such things,

20:35.546 --> 20:39.254
because their attention is on money and not on God.

20:39.826 --> 20:42.440
So either you are on the right or on the left.

20:46.296 --> 20:48.296
Those who are very emotional people,

20:48.505 --> 20:52.263
extremely emotional, more worried about their family;

20:52.331 --> 20:54.290
for them family is everything,

20:54.385 --> 20:57.106
the relations are everything, they are like that,

20:57.201 --> 20:59.645
they may not have so much of Lakshmi because they distribute

20:59.722 --> 21:05.559
all the Lakshmi. But still they are better people. But sometimes

21:06.049 --> 21:07.432
such people who sacrifice

21:07.480 --> 21:08.965
so much for others,

21:09.443 --> 21:12.542
give up everything that they have, can become crazy

21:12.890 --> 21:16.368
because they’ll find people do not reciprocate,

21:16.790 --> 21:18.521
they do not return their love,

21:18.793 --> 21:20.809
they do not understand what they have done.

21:20.990 --> 21:24.407
So going to the extreme of helping others can cause

21:24.451 --> 21:28.224
trouble to the person who does this job, and also trouble to people

21:28.388 --> 21:30.120
who have taken free money from him,

21:30.220 --> 21:33.446
because if you distribute free money to people what will happen?

21:33.823 --> 21:37.492
I'll give you a simple example of America helping India.

21:39.729 --> 21:41.948
When Americans helped India,

21:42.096 --> 21:44.546
they thought they were doing a great favor to Indians,

21:44.773 --> 21:47.428
which was a wrong thing. Because whatever they did

21:47.483 --> 21:50.777
whatever they did was lost in the wilderness.

21:51.205 --> 21:53.428
Nobody tried to maintain it, it was free.

21:55.928 --> 21:58.276
But by giving that they showed the contempt,

22:00.578 --> 22:04.242
and when they gave some wheat and rice to India

22:04.584 --> 22:06.681
there was no grace about it, because

22:06.928 --> 22:09.591
then put some sort of a seed in it

22:09.703 --> 22:12.757
which creted two horrible things in the villages.

22:13.165 --> 22:15.571
One was called as congress grass

22:16.126 --> 22:17.805
because it came from America.

22:18.448 --> 22:23.487
And another was called as a mad acacia.

22:24.309 --> 22:28.473
Babool, as we call it, mad babool. These trees

22:28.730 --> 22:30.801
have gown so much in the villages

22:30.823 --> 22:32.628
that they don't know what to do with them.

22:32.868 --> 22:36.266
They have such big, big thorns that anyone who is stung by them

22:36.682 --> 22:39.168
can even die. They are very poisonous

22:39.738 --> 22:41.251
and if the children get it,

22:41.303 --> 22:45.895
they get such poisonous problems that they cannot be cured.

22:46.176 --> 22:49.068
This is how American government has helped us.

22:49.133 --> 22:52.836
Now who's going to tell them what you have done so ungraciously?

22:53.077 --> 22:56.463
It was better to starve than to get any help from anyone.

22:57.886 --> 23:01.943
Long time back I had said that it is better to starve in this country

23:02.691 --> 23:05.766
than to get any help from these wretched, horrible

23:06.176 --> 23:09.273
Western countries who think no end of themselves.

23:10.251 --> 23:12.562
You just pamper their ego for nothing at all.

23:12.993 --> 23:15.974
What have they got? They have just plastic affluence.

23:16.613 --> 23:19.967
But this ego out of money makes them so stupid

23:21.012 --> 23:24.065
that they don't know what's happening in their own country.

23:24.456 --> 23:26.911
How their country’s going down in every way.

23:27.485 --> 23:30.047
How their people are going down. Either they are in

23:30.094 --> 23:31.912
fear or they are abandoned.

23:32.866 --> 23:34.866
Otherwise they are communist

23:35.065 --> 23:38.242
or they are so-called capitalist

23:38.356 --> 23:39.905
where they are just abandoned.

23:40.652 --> 23:42.351
If you go and see that country,

23:42.840 --> 23:46.236
I mean you can't sit like this anywhere and talk in the outside,

23:46.288 --> 23:49.328
somebody might come and murder somebody.

23:49.543 --> 23:51.731
If you walk in the dark you can be murdered.

23:51.827 --> 23:55.748
In America, so called advanced country of America, in New York City.

23:59.134 --> 24:02.331
So this kind of riches we are trying to aspire, especially

24:02.611 --> 24:05.819
people in Delhi are very anxious to aspire lot of money.

24:07.677 --> 24:10.614
I don't know why Punjabis, Gujaratis

24:11.210 --> 24:13.133
and Maarwadis have taken to this.

24:13.280 --> 24:14.602
Maarwadis are another style.

24:17.024 --> 24:20.233
How the Punjabis and the Gujaratis

24:21.053 --> 24:23.153
are trying to acquire the money.

24:24.601 --> 24:26.967
And when I see them abroad I

24:27.080 --> 24:29.887
just don't know if they are anywhere near India.

24:30.344 --> 24:36.881
Horrid people they. They have no culture left in them that is Indian.

24:37.306 --> 24:39.004
They are absolutely outward.

24:40.559 --> 24:41.997
They think no end of themselves,

24:42.045 --> 24:44.556
they think they have reached the heavens.

24:45.871 --> 24:48.104
Then if you see their Nabhi Chakra,

24:48.208 --> 24:51.458
you'll be amazed, all of them suffer from horrible livers,

24:51.761 --> 24:56.086
high blood pressure, diabetes, heart attacks

24:56.528 --> 24:59.905
and they drink like fish, especially Sardargis.

25:00.041 --> 25:04.711
I was surprised who are supposed to be in the name of God,

25:05.332 --> 25:07.407
they drink like fish.

25:09.070 --> 25:11.917
They are very particular about wearing a Puggadi and a Dhari,

25:11.952 --> 25:13.547
but while drinking they don't mind.

25:14.092 --> 25:17.642
Every Sardargi you go to has a big bar in his house,

25:17.875 --> 25:19.036
where even a lord

25:19.057 --> 25:21.430
does not have because it is regarded as very vulgar in England.

25:22.475 --> 25:25.451
Without learning any aesthetics of that country,

25:26.431 --> 25:30.488
they have become just like a agriculture there is no culture

25:35.112 --> 25:36.313
is the fact,

25:37.207 --> 25:39.504
this is what money has done to them, they have

25:39.637 --> 25:41.134
no respect for themselves.

25:42.273 --> 25:46.296
So this Lakshmi Tattwa is to be balanced. Same about these

25:46.524 --> 25:48.359
Gujaratis who have gone.

25:48.601 --> 25:50.702
Another kind lives here, the Maarwadis.

25:50.775 --> 25:53.228
Less said the better about these horrible Maarwadis.

25:54.210 --> 25:56.996
I don't think anyone of them will ever get Realization

25:57.169 --> 25:59.169
or a place in the Kingdom of God.

26:02.210 --> 26:03.673
They are blood suckers.

26:06.582 --> 26:09.630
They are not human beings. For money's sake, they'll

26:09.783 --> 26:14.455
suck the blood like juice, suck the blood, and now they had a nice time.

26:18.688 --> 26:23.469
This is not a world for you to seek money.

26:23.908 --> 26:26.055
You have come on this earth as a human being

26:26.100 --> 26:30.349
to seek God, to seek your Spirit, to be one with your Self,

26:30.660 --> 26:32.660
to be in that peaceful place

26:33.662 --> 26:38.065
which is the Kingdom of God, which is the Kingdom of Heaven,

26:38.616 --> 26:41.538
and not to jump into a mire

26:41.718 --> 26:43.148
which looks very beautiful

26:44.911 --> 26:52.169
but is not really beautiful. It's agonizing, it's terrorizing.

26:52.285 --> 26:55.021
People can't sleep if they have too much money,

26:55.522 --> 26:57.422
because they don't know what to do with that.

26:57.452 --> 26:59.702
Here also all those who have got money,

27:00.111 --> 27:02.541
they don't know when the income tax will come on them.

27:03.990 --> 27:07.471
I have solved My income tax problem by having no income at all.

27:10.959 --> 27:12.656
I have no income, no income tax,

27:13.034 --> 27:16.029
so I'm not worried about the Income Tax Commissioner.

27:16.620 --> 27:18.251
He cannot control Me.

27:20.533 --> 27:23.006
Best is not to have more income

27:23.504 --> 27:25.331
that is to be taxed, otherwise you’ll have

27:25.351 --> 27:26.768
to have another income tax

27:29.576 --> 27:31.691
lawyer that My brother is.

27:31.996 --> 27:36.026
I told him, “I don't need you at all, all My life, thank you very much.”

27:37.144 --> 27:43.657
You get so absolutely free, on top of the world if you have no income.

27:46.497 --> 27:53.497
Like if you want to solve your car problem, never learn driving.

27:54.055 --> 27:59.797
Somebody drives you down or nothing, you can walk with your feet.

28:01.077 --> 28:03.766
The accumulation of all these nonsensical things

28:04.159 --> 28:06.991
have caused us all this tension, so-called:

28:09.240 --> 28:12.612
“How much we have to pay, what is the income tax,

28:12.935 --> 28:15.835
tomorrow the police is going to come in my house?”

28:16.364 --> 28:18.133
If they come to Me I'll say, “All right,

28:18.327 --> 28:20.903
have everything that you can. Nothing there,

28:21.924 --> 28:27.374
certain bills which I have not paid, that's all.” Just let them pay.

28:30.282 --> 28:33.057
One has to live with complete freedom in this world.

28:33.726 --> 28:37.497
And to achieve that freedom, one has to know that

28:37.596 --> 28:41.286
the priorities should be all right. If money is your priority,

28:41.462 --> 28:47.584
you have it. No, not Me. If you want to give Me money,

28:47.778 --> 28:50.818
“No Sir,” I won't at any cost.

28:51.060 --> 28:55.339
You can give Me flowers, this, that, all right, but no money at all.

28:57.198 --> 29:01.664
I don't want to know about money at all, it's a headache.

29:04.577 --> 29:12.784
In the same way, we do not realize that having relationships -

29:13.667 --> 29:18.397
brother, sister or son, this and that - is another big headache.

29:20.932 --> 29:23.066
That doesn't mean that you should start beating them,

29:23.869 --> 29:28.305
but people can sell their country for the sake of their children.

29:31.279 --> 29:34.929
It’s a very dangerous thing, horrible,

29:35.648 --> 29:38.098
that kind of an attachment, the mamatva (ownership).

29:38.243 --> 29:40.243
This is my son, finished.

29:40.729 --> 29:43.540
If he's your son then you can murder anyone you feel like,

29:43.571 --> 29:46.206
you can do what you like because he is your son.

29:46.252 --> 29:49.128
He is not somebody's son whom you are murdering?

29:51.358 --> 29:53.932
This mamatva that comes - “My husband.”

29:53.962 --> 29:55.206
Specially our Indian women.

29:56.480 --> 30:00.476
“My husband” immediately starts problem.

30:04.460 --> 30:11.460
All this comes out of ignorance. Of course, love has to be there.

30:12.306 --> 30:14.306
But love never gives you attachment,

30:15.535 --> 30:23.573
because it is wise, it is wisdom. Supposing in a tree the sap of the tree

30:23.690 --> 30:28.589
goes and gets fixed in one fruit because it loves. “It's mine.”

30:29.023 --> 30:31.920
Then what happens to the rest of the tree? It dies

30:32.321 --> 30:33.846
and that fruit also dies.

30:38.099 --> 30:40.176
So this mamatva has to go out.

30:40.942 --> 30:42.837
But by telling it will not go,

30:44.954 --> 30:47.078
by just advising it will not go.

30:47.150 --> 30:50.188
Even if you suffer, I have seen so many people coming to Me,

30:50.578 --> 30:53.887
“My own father deceived me.

30:54.468 --> 30:58.197
My own son deceived me.” I said, “Which one is your own?

30:58.797 --> 31:01.771
The one who deceived you is not your own.”

31:04.230 --> 31:05.685
“My husband.”

31:06.122 --> 31:09.260
There are some ladies who eat My head out of their husbands.

31:10.897 --> 31:15.639
“My husband did this, my husband did this, my husband did this.”

31:16.159 --> 31:18.917
Baba, why don't you hit him hard and finish with it?

31:22.191 --> 31:31.203
But it's so much accepted, this mamatva, this attachment.

31:32.434 --> 31:38.203
Attachment to money, attachment to people, attachment to this

31:38.963 --> 31:46.774
is nothing but a hook which hooks you to baser levels.

31:47.716 --> 31:56.889
You have to rise above, and then you really enjoy the beauty of richness.

31:57.802 --> 32:01.733
As I told you the other day, I see all beautiful things.

32:01.765 --> 32:05.471
It's nice I don't possess them. See now these carpets are spread here.

32:06.254 --> 32:09.310
If they were Mine, I should worry, “Oh God, now

32:09.696 --> 32:11.696
I hope they are not going to be spoilt.

32:12.411 --> 32:14.446
I hope nobody sits on them.

32:15.557 --> 32:20.271
I hope they are insured, so nobody runs away with that.”

32:20.529 --> 32:23.369
But when they don't belong to Me, I'm enjoying them better.

32:25.139 --> 32:27.578
Other people's things is a better idea.

32:29.233 --> 32:35.182
This myth carries us to such an extent of stupidity

32:37.063 --> 32:41.507
that sometimes I feel whether these human beings are human beings,

32:41.590 --> 32:46.339
or they are their possessions. Their Spirit is lost,

32:47.864 --> 32:51.936
everything is lost, they're not bothered.

32:52.921 --> 32:57.473
But if their little position is lost, they weep and wail,

32:57.696 --> 33:01.689
as if they are dead, their forefathers are dead hundred times.

33:06.052 --> 33:10.090
But people like Me are just batchas, emperors.

33:10.583 --> 33:17.306
They are not bothered. To them comfort cannot capture,

33:18.213 --> 33:22.170
they don’t need any comfort. If you have comfort

33:22.748 --> 33:25.832
it crawls upon you, it makes you a slave, too.

33:26.228 --> 33:30.594
If you seek comfort you are in for enslavement,

33:31.120 --> 33:34.091
take it from Me. Any kind of comfort.

33:37.883 --> 33:40.952
It's only human beings who can become really so crazy.

33:41.255 --> 33:45.351
No animal can become. There is another type of a comfort,

33:46.007 --> 33:51.394
is that a mental idea

33:51.603 --> 33:53.854
that everybody must appreciate,

33:54.105 --> 33:57.567
and that you should be able to overpower others.

33:57.821 --> 34:00.442
This also comes I think from Nabhi Chakra.

34:01.958 --> 34:03.598
Is a kind of a feeling

34:03.738 --> 34:06.317
that you should be able to overpower many people,

34:06.354 --> 34:07.228
they should look at you.

34:07.684 --> 34:11.044
These days in London there are women who are suffering from

34:11.153 --> 34:13.785
a funny disease called anorexia, where they just don't eat.

34:15.551 --> 34:19.252
Women just don't eat because they should be thin and skinny.

34:19.278 --> 34:21.951
For what? For what you should be thin and skinny?

34:23.280 --> 34:25.681
Because you look attractive, but for what?

34:28.687 --> 34:31.534
I don't think skinny people look attractive by any chance.

34:32.391 --> 34:35.416
Horrible they are. They create only pity

34:35.503 --> 34:39.262
and you feel you know repulsive about the whole stuff.

34:40.598 --> 34:45.661
Once a beauty queen came to see Me. I thought she was a T.B. patient.

34:49.176 --> 34:53.756
And I said, “You look all right but it seems you are a T.B. patient.”

34:53.831 --> 34:57.071
She said, “No Mother, I've got a beauty prize.” “Yes?

34:58.614 --> 35:00.851
Who were the people? Doctors must have given it

35:01.098 --> 35:02.707
because they want some patients there.”

35:04.453 --> 35:05.484
This is the trouble,

35:06.154 --> 35:08.968
we go out of the way to trouble our Nabhi,

35:10.116 --> 35:12.406
not to eat your food, fasting.

35:13.316 --> 35:17.943
If you want to fast this life, next life you will not have any food.

35:18.309 --> 35:21.814
Thank you very much. No food.

35:22.441 --> 35:26.260
Fasting? All right, you’ll have a permanent fasting. What do you say?

35:26.850 --> 35:30.632
You don't have to do any fasting. Why do you want to fast?

35:31.205 --> 35:32.951
And even if you want to fast

35:33.250 --> 35:37.895
because you want to change the timing or maybe

35:38.189 --> 35:39.719
for your health's sake, it's all right.

35:39.967 --> 35:43.561
But why in the name of God you want to malign Me?

35:44.034 --> 35:46.384
You have got everything to eat and you don’t want to eat.

35:47.014 --> 35:49.292
Those who have got food to eat, they don’t want to eat.

35:49.474 --> 35:53.811
Next life they become poor and then they blame the rich.

35:54.758 --> 35:57.283
But in last life you'd been wanted to fast,

35:59.096 --> 36:03.022
so this life you are not given any food, because you asked for it.

36:05.766 --> 36:09.003
And that is how also the Nabhi Chakra gets you twisted,

36:09.094 --> 36:10.638
when you fast like mad.

36:11.495 --> 36:14.370
There is no need to fast in the name of God.

36:14.664 --> 36:18.359
God has given you all the wealth, all the beauty,

36:20.368 --> 36:23.865
all the love. Actually in Sahaja Yoga

36:23.936 --> 36:28.218
if you fast in My name, I think it's horrible

36:28.468 --> 36:31.770
because if you want to trouble your Mother

36:31.831 --> 36:33.680
or to make Her uneasy,

36:34.027 --> 36:35.543
or to take a revenge on Her,

36:35.968 --> 36:37.931
then you say, “Mother, I'm not going to eat my food.”

36:38.070 --> 36:40.809
Then Mother is finished. That's the best way to conquer Her.

36:41.211 --> 36:43.410
To say, “Mother I'm not going to eat my food.”

36:44.142 --> 36:47.341
So this kind of a mad fasting

36:47.446 --> 36:51.493
is also very bad for your Nabhi and when you do that

36:51.588 --> 36:54.344
then you have a problem because you are invaded

36:54.581 --> 36:58.341
by your left-sided, what you call, beyond

37:01.452 --> 37:05.903
the Ida Nadi, you have the collective subconscious;

37:06.578 --> 37:08.578
and you are invaded by them.

37:10.228 --> 37:15.628
And you are in for trouble, physically, mentally, emotionally.

37:17.304 --> 37:19.963
And mostly those people who fast are very hot tempered.

37:21.345 --> 37:24.184
The day they are fasting day is there, never go near them.

37:25.537 --> 37:27.883
Because they are already planning what they are going to eat.

37:32.475 --> 37:35.835
And in the morning they plan and they don't get it,

37:36.176 --> 37:38.401
so they are very angry for that part.

37:40.537 --> 37:43.623
All these asahaja things are not going to help you.

37:43.901 --> 37:45.405
You have to be normal people.

37:46.464 --> 37:49.800
You don't have to put up into tension yourself for Sahaja Yoga, nothing.

37:50.010 --> 37:55.045
Be normal. Be nice people. Don't torture yourself.

37:55.271 --> 37:57.904
That is one point on the Nabhi on the left hand side

37:58.286 --> 38:01.173
and on the right hand side: don't get into indulgences.

38:02.891 --> 38:04.210
Don't pamper yourself.

38:04.895 --> 38:07.197
Both things are the same for Sahaja Yoga.

38:07.380 --> 38:10.829
Whether you starve or you overeat, is the same.

38:11.953 --> 38:15.479
There is no difference between the two, because

38:16.034 --> 38:17.344
if you are not on the seat,

38:17.364 --> 38:18.589
whether you are on the left

38:18.614 --> 38:20.614
falling on the right, does it make any difference?

38:23.186 --> 38:26.142
So to be on the seat is to be

38:26.693 --> 38:29.120
in the blessings of Shri Lakshmi.

38:29.251 --> 38:33.029
And I have described to you how Shri Lakshmi is a lady

38:33.364 --> 38:39.381
and in Her left hand She has got two lotuses and the right,

38:39.514 --> 38:44.925
one lotus, and right hand another lotus on top, which shows a person

38:46.260 --> 38:49.920
who is balancing. She’s balancing on a lotus.

38:50.498 --> 38:53.822
Imagine. She’s standing on a lotus. That means She is balancing.

38:56.541 --> 38:58.541
And She’s balancing, She’s standing there

39:00.124 --> 39:06.052
and She is holding two lotuses in Her hand showing

39:06.742 --> 39:09.591
that She’s like a lotus.

39:11.365 --> 39:15.485
A person who is a rich man, Lakshmi Pati,

39:16.158 --> 39:20.499
has to be like a lotus, warm, pink, warm.

39:21.212 --> 39:24.469
And even a horrible thing, like

39:31.756 --> 39:33.463
wasp-like thing.

39:33.685 --> 39:36.395
I don’t know what you call it in English, you don’t have that black thing.

39:36.897 --> 39:39.563
We have a very black wasp, you see,

39:39.584 --> 39:44.918
which is hard, hard like nut and has angular thorny legs.

39:45.664 --> 39:49.147
That black thing comes in

39:50.314 --> 39:54.415
and is good for nothing, but it comes in

39:56.283 --> 39:59.389
for the residence, for the ashraya,

39:59.939 --> 40:02.954
the lotus keeps it

40:03.475 --> 40:08.113
on top of it’s corolla, which is a very, very soft thing, with all love.

40:08.410 --> 40:11.351
And in the night it closes down so that

40:11.544 --> 40:14.400
the poor insect who is just like a nut

40:14.835 --> 40:18.831
should not get any trouble from the outside weather.

40:19.847 --> 40:24.193
Like a mother who takes the child in the armchair,

40:25.570 --> 40:29.193
that love should be there for a Lakshmi Pati.

40:29.855 --> 40:32.567
How many are Lakshmi Pati’s like that? Have you seen any?

40:34.116 --> 40:38.534
If they see somebody who is coming with money propositions,

40:38.942 --> 40:40.572
then they may open their doors.

40:41.054 --> 40:44.190
Otherwise, they have no love for anybody.

40:44.725 --> 40:49.882
For those who come for their ashrayas, for their help,

40:50.481 --> 40:54.543
they are not there. On the other side

40:54.847 --> 41:07.082
are the people who are so repulsive. They are not like lotus.

41:07.340 --> 41:11.354
There is no fragrance. They are such miserly people

41:12.526 --> 41:18.434
that they stink of miserliness. While the lotus

41:19.499 --> 41:25.605
gives its fragrance through that mud, to that horrible thing

41:26.290 --> 41:31.233
that even the little worms which crawl upon

41:32.752 --> 41:39.443
those lotus petals smell of this beautiful fragrance.

41:41.175 --> 41:44.380
This is what it has to be. It has to give.

41:45.147 --> 41:47.961
It has to be beautiful. It has to be cozy.

41:48.338 --> 41:49.815
It has to be welcoming.

41:51.687 --> 41:55.021
Then another hand is giving.

41:56.141 --> 41:58.798
The Lakshmi is always giving. She doesn’t receive;

41:59.053 --> 42:00.248
She just gives.

42:00.959 --> 42:02.831
If you are really a Lakshmi Pati

42:02.903 --> 42:04.849
you don’t want to have anything from anyone.

42:05.046 --> 42:10.321
You don’t receive. If you are really rich, who can enrich you more?

42:12.613 --> 42:16.578
What can you give to a person who is fully rich? There is no

42:17.038 --> 42:19.656
way of entering into it now it’s all up to the brim.

42:20.317 --> 42:22.533
He’s rich up to the brim. Then what do you give?

42:23.928 --> 42:24.902
You cannot give anything.

42:25.842 --> 42:28.476
But where you have to give means that he’s a beggar –

42:29.592 --> 42:30.480
he’s still a beggar.

42:32.889 --> 42:34.838
All of these so-called rich people

42:35.058 --> 42:36.654
who still are hankering money

42:36.694 --> 42:38.551
are still beggars, they are not rich.

42:39.021 --> 42:42.008
They may think themselves. Empty vessels, but they are not rich

42:42.542 --> 42:44.646
because they are still expecting money.

42:50.303 --> 42:57.303
So, it is important that we should understand,

42:59.262 --> 43:00.943
the money is not the way.

43:01.221 --> 43:03.406
Money takes us away from dharma.

43:03.595 --> 43:05.332
It takes us away from God.

43:05.365 --> 43:08.483
It takes us away from reality. It covers our eyes.

43:09.223 --> 43:10.207
We don’t think

43:10.900 --> 43:15.543
that we have to follow a path of righteousness and of virtue

43:16.280 --> 43:18.973
because we think we are rich, God is going to be afraid of us.

43:19.203 --> 43:21.554
We can even purchase Him and can

43:21.675 --> 43:23.327
manage Him by giving some bribes.

43:25.654 --> 43:26.396
That’s not so.

43:28.053 --> 43:31.567
You must face yourself. You have to face yourself.

43:32.401 --> 43:37.031
That it’s not the money that’s going to give you that elation,

43:38.042 --> 43:46.818
that higher life, but it is the love of God,

43:47.150 --> 43:51.151
the honesty of seeking, honesty.

43:52.412 --> 43:57.150
That is the quality of this chakra is the Satya,

43:58.285 --> 44:00.794
Vishnu, is the Satya.

44:01.420 --> 44:04.136
He’s the Narayana. Narayana means Satya.

44:05.377 --> 44:07.707
So there cannot be Satya Narayan, isn’t it?

44:08.398 --> 44:11.151
Narayan is Satya, then how can there be Satya Narayan?

44:11.694 --> 44:13.694
But we have many Satya Narayana Pujas.

44:15.008 --> 44:18.663
For all these Satya Narayanas, Sahaja Yogis are not supposed to go.

44:19.775 --> 44:22.032
They can only go to Narayana Puja

44:22.689 --> 44:26.504
because Satya Narayana is that path which is added to it

44:27.537 --> 44:30.203
for camouflaging, is meant for these

44:30.280 --> 44:34.462
horrible Brahmins who make you pay. For what?

44:37.847 --> 44:41.970
Sahaja Yogis are not allowed to go to Satya Narayana Puja.

44:42.278 --> 44:47.350
They can have Narayana Puja. And what is Narayana ultimately becomes?

44:48.226 --> 44:56.011
In the Nabhi Chakra Narayana existed since He was created by the Devi.

44:57.926 --> 44:59.401
And It looks after

45:01.439 --> 45:04.982
the seeking, the nourishing of the seeking like a father,

45:05.961 --> 45:10.608
and then It incarnates again and then It incarnates again

45:10.680 --> 45:14.606
to help our seeking to a higher position and a higher position

45:15.377 --> 45:23.131
till it reaches a point where you start seeking God Almighty.

45:23.951 --> 45:28.911
Then you jump into the Shakti of Mahalakshmi.

45:29.349 --> 45:33.587
Then you are in the hands of Mahalakshmi Shakti.

45:34.085 --> 45:38.325
Means Lakshmi evolves into Mahalakshmi principle.

45:42.209 --> 45:49.209
Now this Mahalakshmi principle resides in the central path of Sushumna.

45:50.670 --> 45:59.975
And this central path of Sushumna is to be established fully

46:00.394 --> 46:03.035
and awakened when the Kundalini rises.

46:03.816 --> 46:05.816
When the Kundalini does not rise,

46:06.069 --> 46:09.257
this path is kept absolutely black.

46:11.631 --> 46:17.353
It is absolutely black, there is nothing in it except for the deities

46:18.286 --> 46:21.418
who are lying without any light.

46:23.277 --> 46:27.912
When the Kundalini rises, then only these deities get awakened

46:28.802 --> 46:32.171
and when they get awakened this Sushumna path,

46:32.594 --> 46:38.417
this central path of Mahalakshmi starts acting

46:40.125 --> 46:44.913
as the balancing power, to begin with at the Nabhi chakra.

46:46.180 --> 46:51.697
So Nabhi Chakra is surrounded by ten Gurus, the Prophets

46:52.154 --> 46:53.983
who give you the balance,

46:54.304 --> 46:58.154
who come on this earth again and again to give you balance in life.

46:59.027 --> 47:01.845
They tell you, “don’t do this, don’t do that.”

47:02.009 --> 47:06.295
But we don’t listen, we don’t accept it. We may say

47:06.429 --> 47:08.974
that we follow such guru, such guru. Like,

47:09.085 --> 47:12.420
you know Muslims are. They say, “We follow Mohammed Sahib.”

47:12.987 --> 47:14.720
Now if Mohammed Sahib has said

47:14.965 --> 47:18.588
anything it is that don’t drink, is the thing he said.

47:19.070 --> 47:21.850
But I’ve yet to come across a Muslim who doesn’t drink.

47:22.339 --> 47:25.030
They may not drink in Riyad because they’ll be killed there.

47:25.827 --> 47:27.733
But if they come to London, they drink.

47:27.755 --> 47:29.053
Actually, when My husband

47:29.572 --> 47:31.321
went to Saudi Arabia they said,

47:31.363 --> 47:33.338
“You are the only Muslim we have ever come across.”

47:34.652 --> 47:40.025
It’s true. Whatever is said to them, they do just the opposite of that.

47:40.656 --> 47:43.483
At that time there were no cigarettes, no tobaccos,

47:43.599 --> 47:44.787
so He didn’t say about that

47:44.881 --> 47:46.035
so they have found a loophole.

47:46.120 --> 47:49.855
Muslims smoke, doesn’t matter, because Mohammed Sahib never said.

47:50.824 --> 47:53.120
Mohammed Sahib had to take another birth

47:53.146 --> 47:55.542
to come as Guru Nanaka to tell them, “Oh, God.

47:56.550 --> 48:01.622
Now you are smoking this horrible thing has come, now you don’t smoke.”

48:03.040 --> 48:08.033
But who will accept that Nanaka and Mohammed Sahib were the same people?

48:08.594 --> 48:15.594
No difference. Same thing it was. We can prove it in Sahaja Yoga.

48:17.342 --> 48:22.045
We can prove it, how important it is that we should know

48:22.418 --> 48:23.959
that they were all the same,

48:24.673 --> 48:26.757
and that they stood for the same thing,

48:27.121 --> 48:28.501
but at a period.

48:28.582 --> 48:31.095
Now today you have got ganja,

48:31.221 --> 48:33.799
I don’t know the names also of all these things what you

48:33.948 --> 48:34.642
drink and smoke,

48:34.691 --> 48:35.596
God knows what.

48:36.285 --> 48:37.976
Human beings are really clever

48:38.204 --> 48:40.759
to get everything that can destroy you. It's like,

48:40.955 --> 48:43.561
call a bull, “come and hit me.” It's like that. If there’s

48:43.570 --> 48:46.008
not a bull then you’ll like ask a buffalo, “come and hit me.”

48:46.067 --> 48:48.025
Now there's no buffalo, all right,

48:48.150 --> 48:51.529
you ask an elephant, “come and stampede me.” It's like that.

48:51.750 --> 48:53.162
Human beings are so stupid.

48:53.735 --> 48:55.179
So now supposing, I say

48:55.200 --> 48:56.740
if I write down a list of

48:56.763 --> 48:59.426
all the thing you drink and smoke, I don't know how many things

48:59.452 --> 49:00.544
there are in this world,

49:00.879 --> 49:03.468
then you'll find out the third thing when I die,

49:03.559 --> 49:07.181
that “Mataji didn't say this one.” So we should do it.

49:08.296 --> 49:13.435
Very intelligent. All the time destroying your central path,

49:15.342 --> 49:17.405
and nicely managing through that.

49:17.849 --> 49:20.721
Is this the way are you going to go to God by any chance?

49:22.178 --> 49:24.014
Is this the way are you following

49:24.287 --> 49:26.860
the great incarnations who came on this earth?

49:30.191 --> 49:33.726
So the balancing comes through Nabhi

49:34.404 --> 49:41.318
and Nabhi looks after you and teaches you how to behave.

49:41.893 --> 49:46.126
For example, now your left Nabhi is Gruha Lakshmi.

49:47.644 --> 49:49.909
Gruha Lakshmi is the Deity of the household.

49:51.177 --> 49:53.177
But if you have too much outward type,

49:53.583 --> 49:54.740
you're running a madness.

49:55.754 --> 49:58.343
So early in the morning you get up, read the newspapers.

49:58.531 --> 49:59.926
Is against Sahaja Yoga again.

50:00.418 --> 50:02.865
Not to read newspapers in the morning time.

50:03.005 --> 50:04.534
You can read it in the night,

50:06.169 --> 50:08.975
but not in the morning. Because if you read it in the morning,

50:09.690 --> 50:10.637
you'll get upset.

50:11.812 --> 50:13.523
And poor this spleen has to

50:13.550 --> 50:16.394
pour in more red blood corpuscles

50:16.638 --> 50:18.431
and it becomes mad and fails you.

50:19.880 --> 50:22.201
On the contrary, in the morning talk to your wife,

50:22.457 --> 50:23.549
talk to your children,

50:23.647 --> 50:25.534
look after your Gruha Lakshmi Tattwa.

50:25.592 --> 50:27.775
The wife also has to be a Gruha Lakshmi as I told you.

50:29.548 --> 50:32.389
Then you have your food properly.

50:32.814 --> 50:36.393
Sit down and eat properly. But no,

50:36.866 --> 50:39.453
just after that, upsetting that Nabhi,

50:39.632 --> 50:41.063
you jump into your car,

50:41.440 --> 50:44.140
taking your breakfast in your hand, eating on the way,

50:44.290 --> 50:47.326
honking at people, getting angry with them,

50:49.270 --> 50:51.518
the wife is calling, “Come along you have your breakfast!”

50:51.545 --> 50:55.434
Nothing doing. You are on your way on a special work,

50:55.865 --> 50:59.843
you end up with leukemia at least, minimum of minimum,

50:59.957 --> 51:01.682
if not with heart attack.

51:03.835 --> 51:08.061
Leukemia comes from left Nabhi, when your Gruha Lakshmi is ruined.

51:12.061 --> 51:14.742
The Deity of Gruha Lakshmi is Fatimabai,

51:14.855 --> 51:16.306
the daughter of Mohammed Sahib,

51:19.728 --> 51:26.728
while the daughter of the sister

51:27.720 --> 51:34.684
of Nanak Sahib is on the left Vishuddhi. You'll see that.

51:36.056 --> 51:42.726
Nanaki. Now this aspect of life we never think about.

51:42.893 --> 51:46.186
When you get leukemia, then you'll come to Mother, “please cure me.”

51:46.310 --> 51:47.252
And if you are rich,

51:47.340 --> 51:49.845
you will see to it that I cure that person.

51:49.871 --> 51:51.834
If I don't cure you will sit on My head.

51:52.721 --> 51:56.394
You'll be in ten times on My head unless and until I cure your leukemia.

51:56.449 --> 51:59.806
But if I tell you, “My son, you take it easy,

52:00.198 --> 52:03.324
life is not for getting wretchedness out of you.

52:03.794 --> 52:06.704
What have you gained out of all this running about?

52:07.023 --> 52:07.663
Nothing.

52:07.924 --> 52:09.822
But this horrible left Nabhi

52:09.931 --> 52:13.130
by which you are suffering, your family people are suffering.

52:13.183 --> 52:14.558
Only person who has gained

52:14.806 --> 52:18.160
is the doctor or the doctors or the hospitals.”

52:20.531 --> 52:21.659
They won't listen.

52:23.609 --> 52:27.771
And you know leukemia is such a fast developing disease of cancer

52:28.002 --> 52:31.352
that one can pass out within one month,

52:32.219 --> 52:33.226
doctors will tell you,

52:33.406 --> 52:35.532
at the most you'll live for one month, that's all. They'll

52:35.659 --> 52:38.049
take all the money to give this certificate, very nicely.

52:39.435 --> 52:41.023
But why have that?

52:41.291 --> 52:43.291
Be patient with yourself.

52:43.525 --> 52:46.974
Be kind to your Nabhi, look after your Gruha Lakshmi.

52:49.015 --> 52:51.407
All kinds of diseases of the stomach

52:51.574 --> 52:55.342
come from this imbalance this way or that way.

52:56.130 --> 52:58.655
All these great gurus came on this earth

52:58.814 --> 53:01.717
to give us balance, to teach us balance and tell us,

53:02.126 --> 53:06.297
“Don't do this and don't do that.” All the Ten Commandments.

53:07.149 --> 53:12.423
But to us these Ten Commandment have no meaning.

53:14.630 --> 53:17.850
Now I’ll touch a point which is very important today

53:18.457 --> 53:20.314
for you people to understand

53:20.779 --> 53:23.976
about non-vegetarianism and vegetarianism.

53:24.125 --> 53:26.374
Because this subject I wanted to handle,

53:26.730 --> 53:28.357
because if they are vegetarians they

53:28.384 --> 53:29.656
can’t bear to see

53:29.760 --> 53:32.344
that Mother says it doesn't matter if you are a non-vegetarian,

53:33.591 --> 53:37.526
because it doesn’t go against your awareness. It does not.

53:37.600 --> 53:42.006
But drinking does. Drinking does go against your awareness.

53:42.692 --> 53:48.978
But not eating meat or not eating meat. But one has to understand.

53:49.933 --> 53:54.637
Now somebody told Me that in Gita it is written that those who eat meat

53:56.068 --> 54:02.994
are Tamo Gunis. I am surprised at Gita itself.

54:03.091 --> 54:06.980
Because Shri Krishna Himself in the very beginning,

54:07.599 --> 54:13.029
has told Arjuna that you should go all out to kill all these people,

54:13.455 --> 54:17.621
even your relations, kill, actually kill human beings.

54:17.966 --> 54:21.188
Your relations and your guru also is to be killed,

54:22.299 --> 54:23.587
because I have already killed.

54:24.220 --> 54:27.995
Nothing is going to be killed by you because they are already killed.

54:30.146 --> 54:33.639
And He gives so many explanations that it should not be done,

54:34.331 --> 54:37.768
but He said, “No, I tell you, you have to go and kill.

54:37.968 --> 54:39.936
Surrender yourself to Me and I'll take care of them.”

54:40.323 --> 54:43.781
So how did He preach this, I just don’t understand, in Gita.

54:44.261 --> 54:46.330
Now this seems to be a new introduction

54:46.453 --> 54:49.771
that the people who eat (meat) are Tamo Gunis. They are not,

54:50.688 --> 54:52.831
they are never. They are Rajo Gunis.

54:53.889 --> 54:56.933
If you eat meat you become Rajo Gunis not Tamo Gunis.

54:58.194 --> 55:01.410
Tamo Gunis are the people who eat carbohydrates, we have seen it

55:01.493 --> 55:04.205
in Sahaja Yoga. We have two types of diseases,

55:04.248 --> 55:08.987
one is lethargic organs and one is active organs.

55:10.586 --> 55:17.583
So those who are lethargic having too much carbohydrates

55:18.587 --> 55:22.419
and those who are overactive are having too much proteins in them.

55:24.105 --> 55:28.114
I mean if you take proteins, in the science, scientifically,

55:28.203 --> 55:32.207
will you become lethargic? I mean ask any doctor.

55:33.430 --> 55:34.710
And then the doctor says Gita

55:34.723 --> 55:36.881
is all humbug because it doesn't understand

55:37.026 --> 55:38.028
what it is saying.

55:38.666 --> 55:41.341
And while you say like this that “We must follow Gita.”

55:42.516 --> 55:44.649
I think somebody has gone wrong there

55:44.678 --> 55:46.312
and has written something wrong in Gita

55:46.320 --> 55:49.188
as they have written in Bible, they have written in every book.

55:49.705 --> 55:51.239
I'll tell you what they have written wrong in

55:51.258 --> 55:53.258
Bible later on when it comes to Christ.

55:54.330 --> 55:58.679
I think just some people have put it there for oppose.

55:58.873 --> 56:00.873
If you eat too much meat you get Raj Gunis

56:01.510 --> 56:04.419
and Raj Gunis become as I have told you right-sided people,

56:04.430 --> 56:05.617
become very aggressive

56:06.170 --> 56:08.891
and they become ahamkaris and they can harm.

56:10.116 --> 56:13.324
But the people who just eat grass can become

56:13.391 --> 56:16.253
lethargic, absolutely lethargic.

56:16.658 --> 56:19.106
They will have lethargic heart if not active one,

56:19.137 --> 56:20.419
they will also get heart attack.

56:21.323 --> 56:24.958
They will have lethargic intestines by which they will get

56:25.000 --> 56:27.494
tremendous all the time passing out of the stools,

56:27.529 --> 56:29.434
they'll never be able to digest any food,

56:29.682 --> 56:30.750
they'll be very weak people.

56:31.870 --> 56:35.656
So those people who have a lethargic heart or a lethargic

56:39.986 --> 56:46.461
liver or lethargic intestines should take to proteins.

56:47.345 --> 56:49.145
I'm not saying meats, but proteins.

56:49.645 --> 56:52.011
But a vegetarian doesn't take so much proteins.

56:52.045 --> 56:54.723
It's easier to take meat, there's no harm.

56:55.160 --> 56:59.619
But those who are active people should take

56:59.699 --> 57:02.233
more to vegetables. It’s sensible.

57:03.692 --> 57:07.490
Guru Nanaka ate all the meats, was he a bad man?

57:07.992 --> 57:13.563
These Maarwadis who are supposed to be absolutely abstaining

57:13.613 --> 57:16.495
from even from lahasoon (garlic) and pyaj (onion).

57:17.088 --> 57:20.679
Was He worse than them by any chance?

57:21.425 --> 57:23.425
What about Buddha, Himself? He ate meat

57:23.633 --> 57:26.844
because He died of eating raw meat, Himself.

57:27.913 --> 57:30.010
Only thing you should not eat the meat

57:30.358 --> 57:32.342
of animals which are bigger than you,

57:32.370 --> 57:34.686
and not of a cow which is an Indian cow.

57:35.547 --> 57:36.572
Specially Indian cow.

57:37.021 --> 57:38.902
Also bigger cows are not good

57:38.925 --> 57:40.925
because they give you a problem on the teeth.

57:45.822 --> 57:50.591
But smaller animals, even with Jainism

57:50.657 --> 57:59.370
they said that you must save the bullocks, the cows,

57:59.921 --> 58:03.809
and you must save other animals,

58:04.230 --> 58:06.819
but they never said you must save goats

58:06.833 --> 58:08.341
and you must save chickens.

58:08.966 --> 58:12.603
Because Mahavira knew we cannot give Realization to chickens.

58:13.873 --> 58:16.866
What is the use of saving chickens and mosquitoes

58:17.556 --> 58:19.889
and also bugs?

58:21.678 --> 58:23.678
Of course they are doing like that.

58:24.058 --> 58:26.426
Some Jain people save bugs and

58:26.482 --> 58:32.078
put it on a human being, and they take the blood of those

58:32.724 --> 58:34.724
human beings and they are paid for it.

58:35.698 --> 58:37.272
It's absurd but they do it.

58:37.488 --> 58:39.718
For them bugs are more important than human beings.

58:40.715 --> 58:43.956
Billions and billions of bugs cannot make a human being.

58:46.515 --> 58:49.322
All these absurd ideas we have in this country.

58:50.139 --> 58:54.286
So when I say you are not to be a vegetarian

58:54.331 --> 58:57.309
or non-vegetarian, you have to see what you need and eat that.

58:57.687 --> 59:01.487
But all the time your attention is in food itself is wrong.

59:03.946 --> 59:07.861
So there is no good in you people

59:08.734 --> 59:12.331
getting into these problems of vegetarianism and non-vegetarianism.

59:12.691 --> 59:15.425
Of course in the Western countries people should take

59:15.869 --> 59:21.368
to vegetarian food, not absolutely, but more than what they have,

59:21.608 --> 59:24.942
while the people who are in India who are vegetarians

59:24.982 --> 59:27.084
will have to later on take to meat. Otherwise

59:27.126 --> 59:28.830
they will have lethargic heart.

59:29.039 --> 59:31.443
I’ll cure them once again they will have problem,

59:31.547 --> 59:35.194
then they will have to go for a by-pass. Save money there?

59:36.088 --> 59:39.918
You cannot. You will have lethargic intestines,

59:41.088 --> 59:46.352
then you will have lethargic liver. You will have all kinds of

59:48.362 --> 59:51.723
cirrhosis, or maybe on the hand you might get

59:51.842 --> 59:56.854
all kinds of rashes and things like that, allergies,

59:58.132 --> 01:00:03.393
all these problems will come. And then ultimately such people

01:00:03.607 --> 01:00:07.278
look so peaceful because you see, they are like cabbages.

01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:12.363
Yes. If somebody is like a cabbage

01:00:13.287 --> 01:00:15.116
then how do you give him Realization?

01:00:15.564 --> 01:00:18.138
You can't give Realization to cabbages can you?

01:00:19.810 --> 01:00:22.673
We have to have here chivalrous people,

01:00:22.820 --> 01:00:24.590
brave people, warriors.

01:00:25.262 --> 01:00:29.201
You have to fight the evil forces, and what can

01:00:29.415 --> 01:00:35.100
these people who are cabbages going to do for it?

01:00:40.345 --> 01:00:44.724
One has to understand yatharth, the reality

01:00:44.777 --> 01:00:49.475
and not put your conception. Because you are born in a Jain family

01:00:50.372 --> 01:00:59.155
and that's why you want everybody to eat grass, is wrong , is wrong.

01:00:59.398 --> 01:01:03.670
The one who has to eat protein must eat protein.

01:01:04.897 --> 01:01:07.354
Now what is the food for Sattvic people?

01:01:09.873 --> 01:01:15.209
That one should eat. You can’t live with it. So what I eat? Channa.

01:01:15.829 --> 01:01:22.861
Can you live with channa? Is protein. Channa, or you can eat meat.

01:01:23.329 --> 01:01:27.481
But not very heavy meats, lean meats and ghee,

01:01:36.216 --> 01:01:40.532
and what I eat the most is honey.

01:01:44.523 --> 01:01:48.601
That's My food. Honey I eat, you know that, honey I drink.

01:01:50.710 --> 01:01:54.435
That's. But you can't live with that can you?

01:01:55.529 --> 01:01:58.256
So you have to eat little carbohydrates. Doesn't matter,

01:01:58.836 --> 01:02:01.654
but you balance yourself in Nabhi Chakra

01:02:04.837 --> 01:02:08.412
But there should be no attention on food at all.

01:02:09.398 --> 01:02:10.984
Actually if you ask Me what I ate

01:02:10.998 --> 01:02:12.642
in the morning, I won't be able to tell you.

01:02:12.678 --> 01:02:16.048
Really I'm very bad at it because I have no attention on it.

01:02:16.550 --> 01:02:19.434
Whatever one gets, eat it, and you don't feel like eating, don't eat.

01:02:20.052 --> 01:02:26.173
What's so important is to enjoy every moment of your life.

01:02:27.407 --> 01:02:30.210
If a person is finicky about food, specially Indians are,

01:02:30.631 --> 01:02:32.435
is very dangerous for Nabhi Chakra.

01:02:33.439 --> 01:02:36.588
Because those who are mad after food

01:02:37.002 --> 01:02:38.567
and about Nabhi Chakra

01:02:40.929 --> 01:02:43.306
are extremely hot-tempered, I think and...

01:02:43.782 --> 01:02:46.025
I don’t know what the word in English is but in

01:02:46.038 --> 01:02:47.793
Hindi we call it chichode,

01:02:52.087 --> 01:02:56.554
irritable, irritable, and these chichode

01:02:57.684 --> 01:02:59.493
will make their wives’ lives miserable.

01:02:59.874 --> 01:03:03.546
They will come and tell, “In that house I ate very good curry nuts.”

01:03:04.765 --> 01:03:07.479
So that poor lady is running after the curry nuts.

01:03:07.517 --> 01:03:09.982
We Indians are so much food-minded.

01:03:10.934 --> 01:03:13.477
You can't imagine, they won't believe we are supposed to be

01:03:13.500 --> 01:03:14.290
starving people.

01:03:15.163 --> 01:03:17.163
But we are so food-minded

01:03:17.790 --> 01:03:20.122
that once there was for these Bengalis,

01:03:20.161 --> 01:03:22.757
supposed to be Mukha Bengalis, I must tell you about them.

01:03:23.314 --> 01:03:25.819
They had raw fish, raw fish which they get it

01:03:25.826 --> 01:03:26.999
from the Central India

01:03:27.431 --> 01:03:29.928
and people couldn't get fish so they were starving.

01:03:30.621 --> 01:03:32.576
So Bombay people very graciously sent

01:03:32.775 --> 01:03:35.479
one shipload, because I know that, I was part of it,

01:03:36.338 --> 01:03:40.858
to them as a gracious act that let the Bengalis eat the fish.

01:03:40.989 --> 01:03:43.902
They said, “What? We are not going to eat sea fish,

01:03:44.441 --> 01:03:45.955
we are Bangladeshis.”

01:03:46.980 --> 01:03:49.589
Threw all the fishes in the sea.

01:03:49.628 --> 01:03:52.431
It all become sardana (rotten) and it was thrown into the sea.

01:03:52.791 --> 01:03:55.401
Can you imagine? Nobody will believe in the West,

01:03:55.415 --> 01:03:57.678
this is how we are fasting and

01:03:57.722 --> 01:04:00.478
that is how we are poor people.

01:04:00.578 --> 01:04:05.160
Can poor people afford to throw away one shipload of fish

01:04:05.460 --> 01:04:08.560
in the sea because they want raw fish?

01:04:10.651 --> 01:04:16.879
We are so food-minded that our Nabhis are always like this.

01:04:17.704 --> 01:04:19.774
And our women are to be blamed because

01:04:19.786 --> 01:04:22.777
they know to control their husbands, they are spoilt them.

01:04:28.041 --> 01:04:30.440
The job of a woman is to be a Gruha Lakshmi.

01:04:31.060 --> 01:04:34.273
To have ideals before the family,

01:04:34.818 --> 01:04:37.044
ideals before a husband,

01:04:37.121 --> 01:04:39.121
ideals before the children.

01:04:39.622 --> 01:04:41.366
The house should be ideal,

01:04:41.427 --> 01:04:44.786
should be a warm house where everybody's welcome.

01:04:45.350 --> 01:04:48.658
The wife’s job is to keep her Nabhi all right,

01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:52.057
the Nabhi of the children all right and the Nabhi of the husband

01:04:52.116 --> 01:04:54.441
and Nabhi of all the people who come to her house.

01:04:56.098 --> 01:04:58.456
She has to lead a life of auspiciousness,

01:04:59.088 --> 01:05:05.452
of kindliness, of religious nature. She has to be a soft-natured woman.

01:05:08.440 --> 01:05:12.178
But this is all missing, only thing she is worried with,

01:05:12.327 --> 01:05:17.339
how to please the husbands. Because that's one of the big jobs for her.

01:05:19.230 --> 01:05:21.302
So to keep our Nabhi all right

01:05:21.447 --> 01:05:23.447
we have to understand as Sahaja Yogis

01:05:24.301 --> 01:05:28.171
that we have not to pay so much attention to food.

01:05:30.365 --> 01:05:33.097
That doesn't mean you eat all dirty food.

01:05:34.027 --> 01:05:37.098
But it definitely means that when you eat your food,

01:05:37.238 --> 01:05:39.238
you must see the vibrations of the food.

01:05:40.291 --> 01:05:42.510
You must always give vibrations to the food.

01:05:42.991 --> 01:05:44.991
Eat the food which is vibrated.

01:05:45.970 --> 01:05:48.138
Certain foods, now supposing if

01:05:48.159 --> 01:05:52.422
I have to go and eat in any one of these big five star hotels,

01:05:53.034 --> 01:05:54.266
next moment I vomit,

01:05:54.433 --> 01:05:57.513
I always vomit. If somebody invites Me in a hotel,

01:05:58.322 --> 01:06:00.842
I start thinking, ‘Baba, now what an ordeal.’

01:06:01.654 --> 01:06:03.686
Because it is not cooked with love.

01:06:05.905 --> 01:06:08.452
That's what it says [Marathi],

01:06:10.455 --> 01:06:13.625
“He likes the little berries of Shabari.”

01:06:14.868 --> 01:06:20.918
[ Marathi]

01:06:25.557 --> 01:06:29.597
Was does that mean?  That means the love

01:06:30.231 --> 01:06:34.259
that is expressed in that food

01:06:35.231 --> 01:06:37.231
is what we should care for,

01:06:42.365 --> 01:06:47.159
and not for the lavishness, not for the show of it

01:06:47.300 --> 01:06:50.481
and not at all for your own taste,

01:06:50.895 --> 01:06:53.045
but the taste of food should be

01:06:53.242 --> 01:06:57.478
that it should carry love. Let your tongue feel the love.

01:07:02.385 --> 01:07:03.897
That is the best taste,

01:07:04.237 --> 01:07:07.539
and whatever is cooked with love always tastes very well.

01:07:12.119 --> 01:07:13.541
So when you cook,

01:07:14.406 --> 01:07:18.265
cook with love. When you eat, eat with love.

01:07:19.235 --> 01:07:23.207
With kind words to the person who has cooked with love

01:07:24.726 --> 01:07:31.205
and above all, count your blessings, count your blessings,

01:07:33.347 --> 01:07:37.847
and think of others who may not have had food today.

01:07:39.310 --> 01:07:41.069
This is the Lakshmi Tattwa, is

01:07:41.439 --> 01:07:43.729
where the hand is like this, where it gives

01:07:44.095 --> 01:07:49.850
and there's a hand where it gives protection to people who need money.

01:07:50.325 --> 01:07:51.953
But not in a way we do it,

01:07:52.887 --> 01:07:55.612
the way Americans do or Russians do it. We do the way

01:07:56.268 --> 01:07:57.453
Lakshmi does,

01:07:57.898 --> 01:08:00.951
that this protection does not get out of hand.

01:08:01.101 --> 01:08:03.440
You give it without telling anyone.

01:08:03.461 --> 01:08:05.279
Just because you have to give you give,

01:08:05.988 --> 01:08:07.436
and actually you do that.

01:08:07.917 --> 01:08:11.482
If you have given, as My father said, one rupee to someone,

01:08:11.744 --> 01:08:14.482
run away from that person as soon as possible

01:08:16.074 --> 01:08:18.074
with the speed of one mile, he said.

01:08:18.298 --> 01:08:19.699
But if you have given

01:08:20.332 --> 01:08:24.209
five rupees, run away from him at the speed of 500 miles.

01:08:26.430 --> 01:08:27.594
It's very practical.

01:08:29.270 --> 01:08:30.779
That is how we have to give.

01:08:31.150 --> 01:08:32.862
This is the Lakshmi Tattwa,

01:08:33.405 --> 01:08:36.167
is the Nabhi Chakra about which I have told you.

01:08:36.865 --> 01:08:39.930
It's a very important Chakra,

01:08:40.555 --> 01:08:46.646
because today you are here because in your Chakra,

01:08:46.733 --> 01:08:49.171
Mahalakshmi Tattwa was awakened

01:08:49.689 --> 01:08:55.059
because you wanted to seek God. Because you wanted to come to God.

01:08:55.685 --> 01:08:58.265
You have not come here for money.

01:08:59.234 --> 01:09:03.760
You have not come here for anything else but God.

01:09:03.898 --> 01:09:05.898
Your seeking is in God.

01:09:06.225 --> 01:09:08.506
You want to know the truth about God

01:09:08.762 --> 01:09:10.762
and you want to have God.

01:09:11.143 --> 01:09:13.782
You don't want to put your ideas on to this,

01:09:13.868 --> 01:09:17.585
but you want to see how Mother wants

01:09:17.775 --> 01:09:19.991
us to receive the blessings of God.

01:09:20.832 --> 01:09:27.331
So become that as we seek the love of God, the grace of God.

01:09:28.988 --> 01:09:34.417
The Lakshmi has to be gracious and the Mahalakshmi

01:09:34.661 --> 01:09:40.518
is the One who is the gracious lady, is the graciousness in you.

01:09:40.989 --> 01:09:45.498
The grace that must come evolved into your personality.

01:09:45.982 --> 01:09:48.967
Within that grace he feels the hankering of the Father.

01:09:49.841 --> 01:09:54.973
The Father, the Narayana. He wants to have His blessings,

01:09:55.396 --> 01:09:57.766
and that is how the first, the truth,

01:09:58.086 --> 01:10:00.405
the seeking of the truth rises in you,

01:10:01.070 --> 01:10:04.676
and that is how the honesty of seeking is blessed

01:10:05.565 --> 01:10:07.090
when the Kundalini rises.

01:10:07.203 --> 01:10:10.842
She first gives you - first thing that you get

01:10:11.286 --> 01:10:15.896
is the truth, by enlightening your brain.

01:10:16.395 --> 01:10:18.395
When I will tell you about Sahasrara

01:10:19.128 --> 01:10:26.128
and about Agnya, I will tell you how this brain becomes

01:10:27.716 --> 01:10:30.486
a receptor of the ultimate truth,

01:10:31.621 --> 01:10:35.148
how truth is spread, you start

01:10:35.347 --> 01:10:38.818
receiving the knowledge of absolute truth.

01:10:39.609 --> 01:10:41.609
How this brain when enlightened

01:10:42.102 --> 01:10:50.481
gives you the power to know what is truth and what is not truth,

01:10:51.063 --> 01:10:54.239
and there are no alternatives.

01:10:56.291 --> 01:10:57.945
This I'll tell you later on

01:10:58.163 --> 01:11:01.500
when the Kundalini I'll describe at the brain level.

01:11:01.953 --> 01:11:06.516
But for today I think Nabhi Chakra is very important.

01:11:07.096 --> 01:11:09.750
For all of us, for India specially,

01:11:09.776 --> 01:11:11.627
our Nabhi Chakra is very important,

01:11:13.249 --> 01:11:16.175
that we should know that God Almighty,

01:11:16.787 --> 01:11:20.308
the Narayana, the Vishnu,

01:11:21.404 --> 01:11:25.559
is the One who gives the kshema after Yoga.

01:11:25.605 --> 01:11:28.732
He says, “Yoga Kshema Mahatmyam,” He gives the kshema.

01:11:29.918 --> 01:11:32.528
And we are sinning against the God

01:11:33.814 --> 01:11:37.084
when we don't believe that honest and

01:11:37.099 --> 01:11:40.820
righteous and virtuous life will give us the kshema

01:11:40.939 --> 01:11:42.939
as promised by God Almighty.

01:11:43.358 --> 01:11:47.397
You are sinning against our Father, while in the West

01:11:47.648 --> 01:11:49.882
they are sinning against the Mother

01:11:50.378 --> 01:11:51.942
on the left hand side,

01:11:52.058 --> 01:11:56.425
because they have forgotten that immoral life

01:11:56.677 --> 01:11:59.655
is an insult to the Mother Power of God.

01:12:01.028 --> 01:12:03.170
So both things are important,

01:12:03.581 --> 01:12:06.875
whether in the West or East, is important

01:12:07.449 --> 01:12:11.908
that we should not sin against the Father and sin against the Mother.

01:12:13.767 --> 01:12:16.750
I hope I've tried to tell you everything

01:12:17.031 --> 01:12:19.276
in such a way that you do not feel hurt.

01:12:19.630 --> 01:12:22.209
Because all of you come from different, different

01:12:22.809 --> 01:12:25.588
types of lives; different, different conceptions;

01:12:26.017 --> 01:12:30.383
different, different gurus, and you can get confused about it.

01:12:30.877 --> 01:12:33.701
So, in Sahaja Yoga you should

01:12:33.734 --> 01:12:36.126
allow this to work out.

01:12:36.506 --> 01:12:40.301
Allow the light to come in and don't get confused, don't get upset.

01:12:40.801 --> 01:12:42.909
Here you are to seek God

01:12:43.204 --> 01:12:46.125
and not to sit on what you have known so far,

01:12:46.193 --> 01:12:49.390
or which you have heard so far, or whatever you have followed.

01:12:49.597 --> 01:12:53.739
Because that has not given you anything whatsoever.

01:12:54.278 --> 01:12:59.168
Like one of My disciples who's a big officer

01:13:00.446 --> 01:13:02.610
and one day he told Me, “Mother,

01:13:02.686 --> 01:13:04.606
I don't know about Gita,

01:13:04.595 --> 01:13:07.371
I don't know about Ramana, Krishna, anyone.

01:13:07.898 --> 01:13:12.313
I know You, because You are the One who has given me Realization.”

01:13:14.959 --> 01:13:18.443
Of course after knowing Me you will know all of them.

01:13:18.846 --> 01:13:20.846
But it is better you know Me now, because

01:13:21.121 --> 01:13:23.903
Those are no more here. It is I Who is sitting here,

01:13:24.211 --> 01:13:25.790
so better know Me first,

01:13:26.228 --> 01:13:28.228
and then you will know Them better

01:13:28.418 --> 01:13:30.768
than what you have known Them before.

01:13:31.094 --> 01:13:33.647
So let us compromise in this point:

01:13:33.847 --> 01:13:37.118
that try to understand it through Sahaja Yoga.

01:13:37.178 --> 01:13:40.637
Everything can be proved. Whatever I have said is absolute truth,

01:13:41.791 --> 01:13:42.889
nothing but the truth.

01:13:43.696 --> 01:13:48.511
But you allow yourself not to be bound by any

01:13:48.605 --> 01:13:51.083
previous ideas and previous conceptions.

01:13:51.239 --> 01:13:54.480
But let it be open mind to see what I've said,

01:13:54.573 --> 01:13:57.933
it's just a hypothesis, let it become a law.

01:13:58.134 --> 01:14:01.596
When you see it yourself, when it becomes in your heart,

01:14:01.690 --> 01:14:04.884
on the vibrations, when you see and judge what I've said,

01:14:04.989 --> 01:14:12.716
you'll be amazed that Nabhi Chakra which you feel on these fingers,

01:14:13.156 --> 01:14:15.156
even the children can tell you.

01:14:16.340 --> 01:14:19.728
May God bless you all. Thank you very much.

01:14:22.142 --> 01:14:26.457
Tomorrow I'll tell you about other chakra called

01:14:26.587 --> 01:14:30.628
the Chakra of the Devi, Herself .

01:14:36.022 --> 01:14:39.173
If there are any questions, I've told you, you better write it down.

01:14:39.242 --> 01:14:40.884
It's always worked out very well.

01:14:41.334 --> 01:14:45.321
I think now we should go in for meditation and try

01:14:45.784 --> 01:14:47.784
to get your Realization.

01:15:16.535 --> 01:15:19.287
Will you please put your hands towards Me,

01:15:21.358 --> 01:15:24.042
like this, just in humble way.

01:15:24.394 --> 01:15:28.878
Because you have not known so far, and you will know it

01:15:29.590 --> 01:15:33.980
when you will know it: So you put your hands towards Me like this

01:15:34.997 --> 01:15:36.505
and as I've told you these are

01:15:36.546 --> 01:15:39.213
five chakras, sixth and seventh chakra is here is on our hands.

01:15:39.757 --> 01:15:41.258
Five chakras, sixth and seventh.

01:15:44.648 --> 01:15:45.919
I must tell you today I met

01:15:46.001 --> 01:15:48.001
some Kashmiri Muslims, that's a good idea.

01:15:48.707 --> 01:15:51.945
Suddenly they did feel for Me something. I don't know how.

01:15:52.656 --> 01:15:54.656
And they said, “Are You the Mother?”

01:15:54.814 --> 01:15:57.305
I said, “Yes, I am.” They came to Me

01:15:58.140 --> 01:16:01.315
and then said that “You must tell us about Ruh, about Ruh,

01:16:02.197 --> 01:16:04.139
about spiritual life, about Spirit.”

01:16:05.418 --> 01:16:06.378
They came to Me. I said,

01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:08.006
“All right, you put your hands towards Me like this.”

01:16:08.570 --> 01:16:11.746
They put their hands towards Me and they felt the cool breeze.

01:16:12.286 --> 01:16:14.921
And they said, “This is what it is. Mohammed has said

01:16:15.187 --> 01:16:18.549
that your hands will speak. This is it. That's the truth.”

01:16:19.993 --> 01:16:21.602
I said, “Yes,

01:16:24.575 --> 01:16:26.575
when you have your second birth,

01:16:26.796 --> 01:16:29.294
you’ll be rid of all the nonsense of

01:16:29.640 --> 01:16:33.119
these so-called religions which are separating you.

01:16:34.079 --> 01:16:36.265
They were never meant to be separated,

01:16:36.539 --> 01:16:40.036
they were meant to integrate you. But you have done it, doesn't matter.

01:16:40.580 --> 01:16:45.118
Now by God's grace Sahaja Yoga has come, you'll have second birth.

01:16:45.677 --> 01:16:48.064
So all the things that are attached to your birth

01:16:48.540 --> 01:16:54.534
will be finished and you’ll be a new person having a new life in which

01:16:54.889 --> 01:16:59.176
you forget all that is attacking you,

01:16:59.351 --> 01:17:02.493
is attached to you, which is dragging you,

01:17:02.657 --> 01:17:07.452
which is making you think, think, think but not ascend.”

01:17:09.214 --> 01:17:13.517
I'm very happy, these simple Muslims who met Me, they were in a shop

01:17:13.836 --> 01:17:17.514
selling something, and they were so sweet and so beautiful.

01:17:20.872 --> 01:17:23.301
They didn't say that “You are not Mohammed.” Nothing of the kind.

01:17:23.357 --> 01:17:25.209
They said, “This is what Mohammed has said,

01:17:25.478 --> 01:17:27.845
that “At the time of the Resurrection, your hands will speak,”

01:17:29.305 --> 01:17:32.795
and what are these people fighting for?”

01:17:35.484 --> 01:17:39.826
You see. This is what it is.

01:17:41.610 --> 01:17:43.433
May God bless you all!

01:17:48.494 --> 01:17:52.728
Let us have now both the hands towards Me and close your eyes

01:17:52.882 --> 01:17:54.882
just close your eyes.

01:17:55.628 --> 01:17:57.183
[Shri Mataji gives Realization.]
