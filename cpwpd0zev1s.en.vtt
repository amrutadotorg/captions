WEBVTT

00:16.046 --> 00:23.463
Today we have assembled here to celebrate
the birth of Christ.

00:24.925 --> 00:33.292
When you think of His birth one knows that
He was born in a very humble place

00:34.246 --> 00:39.850
and all His life He lived in a very humble
way.

00:42.095 --> 00:50.276
Also, as Sahaja yogis, you know that He was
the incarnation of Shri Ganesha

00:50.453 --> 00:57.449
which is, in essence, is innocence and He
was

01:00.548 --> 01:10.062
crucified due to the stupid understanding
of blind people.

01:12.753 --> 01:19.563
He was the eternal child and it’s so sad
that

01:20.506 --> 01:31.488
when we talk about Christ and Christianity

01:31.689 --> 01:36.540
we feel that Christianity has gone just
the other way around,

01:36.741 --> 01:40.719
on the other side of Christ.

01:40.920 --> 01:45.940
If one is construction, the another is
destruction

01:47.259 --> 01:52.021
and if one is innocence, another is cunning.

01:52.222 --> 01:58.905
If you see the Christian nations, it's very
surprising where we have got Christianity

01:59.106 --> 02:07.072
in its practice; it's very surprising that
innocence has no place, no respect,

02:07.273 --> 02:16.080
chastity has no place, no respect, which
was the essence of Christ,

02:16.281 --> 02:20.280
He was made of it.

02:23.901 --> 02:30.014
It is sometimes shocking how these so-called
Christian nations

02:30.214 --> 02:34.151
have maligned Christ to that extent

02:36.598 --> 02:41.524
and how they have ruined so many people
with their stupid ideas

02:41.725 --> 02:48.788
of allowing people to indulge into all kinds
of filthy things.

02:50.432 --> 02:55.017
And the second point is very important,
to see how

02:55.218 --> 03:00.188
He was born in a very humble abode,

03:00.389 --> 03:04.381
He lived in a very humble way.

03:04.946 --> 03:10.644
He was a son of a carpenter so He lived
like a carpenter,

03:14.337 --> 03:21.306
but in the Western life people are so
materialistic

03:21.507 --> 03:27.590
and to them to live lavishly, to show off
their wealth

03:27.791 --> 03:32.991
and to plunder people, plunder countries
after countries

03:33.192 --> 03:37.843
for material gain is a common thing.

03:38.044 --> 03:46.294
They do not feel also that it is wrong and
they are quite proud of it.

03:46.495 --> 03:52.148
And the third great thing about Christ was
that

03:52.349 --> 03:58.942
He wanted people to love each other and
to be humble,

03:59.143 --> 04:07.425
but the arrogance and the cruelty that one
has seen of the Christian nations

04:07.626 --> 04:14.846
one cannot understand how are they anywhere
near Christ.

04:15.864 --> 04:21.647
He has said about, "Blessed are those who
are meek".

04:21.848 --> 04:27.566
Where are those meek people living? Not
in the western countries,

04:27.767 --> 04:32.967
not in the countries where Christ is
worshipped, where temples are raised,

04:33.168 --> 04:41.261
are raised in His honor and have been
worshipping the Mother for so many years.

04:41.462 --> 04:46.865
What a sinful thing it is to do to Christ.

04:47.311 --> 04:53.667
Is the greatest sin that we say that we are
following Christ

04:53.868 --> 04:57.126
and to do all these horrible things,

04:57.308 --> 05:03.222
all such people have to go to hell
of the worst type, no doubt about it.

05:03.423 --> 05:07.000
They may not realize but they are already
getting into it,

05:07.169 --> 05:10.515
they are already having this problem.

05:10.716 --> 05:16.259
They are worse than people who crucified
Christ, this is every-day crucifixion.

05:16.460 --> 05:21.938
So it's a great occasion today to celebrate

05:22.139 --> 05:28.184
the birth of Christ, who came on this earth
to help us in our resurrection,

05:28.385 --> 05:32.218
to talk about the Holy Ghost.

05:32.918 --> 05:38.565
He was bearing all the brunt of the people,
everything,

05:38.766 --> 05:43.616
but the outcome of that life is so
horrifying that sometimes I get worried

05:43.817 --> 05:48.423
that I hope they don't make something out
of Me like that.

05:48.624 --> 05:53.901
It is such a stupid ideas people have
in the west,

05:54.102 --> 05:59.650
that for any sensible man he can see the way

05:59.851 --> 06:07.544
they are emotional, romantic, nonsensical.
They have no respect

06:08.220 --> 06:12.787
for themselves and to follow Christ with
that kind of an attitude is, I think is,

06:12.988 --> 06:18.984
they have no business, they have no right,
but it has happened.

06:19.185 --> 06:25.847
Now you people are born again as Christ
has said, "You are to be born again".

06:26.048 --> 06:31.843
You have achieved that state which Christ
was talking about.

06:32.044 --> 06:38.697
You are the special type of people. I never
had such hopes I must say.

06:38.898 --> 06:44.911
The first encounter was so horrible that I
didn't think that many will come out of it

06:45.112 --> 06:48.519
but so many of you have come out of it

06:48.720 --> 06:55.314
and have really glorified the name of
Christ, no doubt about it, and keep it up.

06:55.515 --> 06:58.429
I would request you now to know that you
are Sahaja yogis

06:58.630 --> 07:01.839
and that you are the followers of Christ.

07:02.040 --> 07:07.031
You are the Gnostics as described, you are
the ones who know

07:07.232 --> 07:12.886
and that's how you have to help people
to emancipate.

07:13.087 --> 07:21.327
It is very surprising that I saw that
the Western life,

07:21.528 --> 07:30.372
the stupid, destructive ideas, did not kill
the innocence.

07:30.573 --> 07:39.153
Like the clouds, all these affectations
were there

07:39.354 --> 07:44.306
but once the Kundalini rose the innocence
started expressing itself.

07:44.507 --> 07:53.394
But still, I would say that this kind
of lovey-dovey stuff

07:53.595 --> 07:59.806
must be given up. It is just most
un-Christian

08:00.007 --> 08:05.632
because if you see His life, it was a life
of a tapasvi,

08:05.833 --> 08:13.375
a man who lived in a very detached manner,
in nisanga.

08:13.576 --> 08:17.927
So for Sahaja yogis who are coming from
Christian life

08:18.128 --> 08:22.554
have to understand if they have to get rid
of it, they should be like that.

08:22.755 --> 08:27.302
But on the contrary, see the interest
in marriages,

08:27.503 --> 08:34.621
the interest in all this kind of thing and
after marriage - is a bit too much.

08:36.893 --> 08:41.922
It is so much in it, I mean it’s absurd,
it's absurd in Sahaja Yoga.

08:42.123 --> 08:49.612
It's one of the lifestyles, is alright, one
of the part, it's not everything;

08:49.813 --> 08:55.405
and it covers the whole entire personality
of a Christian personality.

08:55.606 --> 09:01.640
Not with Muslims or Hindus, I've seen that.
I mean, I'm married too.

09:01.841 --> 09:08.641
But it doesn't cover My whole entire being
with it. How can it?

09:08.842 --> 09:13.505
And that's the problem is - that once
marriage system starts, anything starts,

09:13.706 --> 09:18.803
“oh it becomes so important” and I'm faced
with problems all the time.

09:19.004 --> 09:22.025
The marriage is performed then letters will
be coming,

09:22.226 --> 09:24.967
“this has happened to my marriage”.
They must get married,

09:25.168 --> 09:28.034
nobody is such that, supposing now one is
finished,

09:28.243 --> 09:33.699
live without marriage, they cannot do it,
just can't live.

09:33.900 --> 09:37.146
Christ never got married.

09:37.347 --> 09:42.618
They cannot have that tapasvita in them
and they depend so much,

09:42.819 --> 09:46.282
they'll ruin their wives, they'll ruin
their husbands, they'll ruin Sahaja Yoga.

09:46.483 --> 09:49.218
They'll take them away - but it's something
surprising -

09:49.419 --> 09:56.358
the importance of Sahaja Yoga is so
minimized by this Christian mind,

09:56.876 --> 10:02.426
[that?] I don't know from where these ideas
have come to you.

10:04.452 --> 10:11.517
It's a juxtaposition as you can call it,
juxtaposition.

10:11.718 --> 10:17.163
There is no similarity between the life
Christ must have thought

10:17.364 --> 10:20.231
people would lead and the people are
leading.

10:20.455 --> 10:26.578
So it is necessary for Sahaja yogis to have
a dignity and a sense

10:26.779 --> 10:29.527
and to know that they are grounded
in Sahaja Yoga

10:29.728 --> 10:37.605
and marriage and all those things are just
subsidiary. It's not the end of life.

10:38.612 --> 10:44.427
And when I see that happening I am rather
surprised in Sahaja Yoga

10:44.628 --> 10:50.622
I have to marry people because I believe
that one should lead a proper married life.

10:50.823 --> 10:55.741
Because if you just take up a sanyasa
without going through this married life,

10:55.942 --> 11:00.122
you can be very much hypocritical.

11:00.323 --> 11:04.733
But that doesn't mean that marriage is
everything.

11:04.934 --> 11:11.700
It's not so important, it's just something
has to happen.

11:11.901 --> 11:16.227
It's not even important than any puja;

11:16.428 --> 11:21.973
it's not even important than praying to Me;

11:22.174 --> 11:26.138
it's not even important than meditating;

11:26.339 --> 11:33.189
it's not important at all than even eating
your food.

11:34.835 --> 11:39.148
The more I know you start making of it
you fall into the same trap

11:39.349 --> 11:42.516
from where I pulled you out.

11:43.373 --> 11:51.073
So as I, the other day I was telling people
about what they have to do

11:51.274 --> 11:59.312
about these caste system we have in India.
So in the society of Sahaja yogis,

11:59.513 --> 12:05.071
it should be only a one day affair or two
day affair at the most.

12:05.684 --> 12:11.140
But so much importance, husband, wives,
getting married,

12:11.333 --> 12:16.719
then solving their problems, I get
a headache with them.

12:16.920 --> 12:19.900
And they'll always come "my wife, you know,
she's like this,

12:20.101 --> 12:23.898
and wife's sister like that, and wife's
this".

12:24.099 --> 12:28.084
I mean, one should be ashamed even to say
that "my wife".

12:28.285 --> 12:34.049
In India nobody says like that. I don't
think anybody will say "my wife".

12:34.250 --> 12:40.072
It's not done. At the most they'll say
"my children's mother",

12:40.273 --> 12:45.777
and if you have no children you don't say
anything.

12:47.906 --> 12:55.509
So this is the doom from which you have
come out. Please try to understand.

12:56.455 --> 13:01.812
From hell we have come out, absolutely
wrong ideas we had,

13:01.981 --> 13:10.453
from there we have come out, now be
dignified, be sensible.

13:11.344 --> 13:16.049
An over-importance to such un-important
thing

13:16.250 --> 13:20.175
will not allow you to rise very high
in life.

13:20.376 --> 13:22.522
But I don't say you don't marry, you must
marry.

13:22.723 --> 13:28.656
Of course, if you have a Sahaja yogini who
is also a good Sahaja yogini and she knows

13:28.857 --> 13:34.044
about Sahaja Yoga and then of course you
are helped much more, definitely.

13:34.212 --> 13:41.632
You get much more power, much more
understanding, much more joy

13:41.833 --> 13:47.529
and it's very good but the entire
relationship is so important

13:47.730 --> 13:53.802
on small, small things, this is just beyond
Me to understand.

13:54.003 --> 13:59.030
Then I see that then the girls fall in love
with the man whom they marry, finished;

13:59.231 --> 14:02.731
the man is finished, the woman is finished.

14:03.376 --> 14:10.519
Today I am taking this great occasion
to tell you

14:10.720 --> 14:16.609
that Christ was born to Immaculata;

14:20.888 --> 14:26.320
and that's how I have given you your second
birth

14:28.044 --> 14:31.529
and you are so pure.

14:32.108 --> 14:37.086
So all the impurities, you must see them
clearly.

14:37.287 --> 14:44.264
I know you don't like them but they still
creep from here and there.

14:44.465 --> 14:49.417
Of course if the society you see in the west
is a society which

14:49.618 --> 14:52.803
of course there is no family, no wife,
nothing of the kind,

14:53.004 --> 14:57.647
so it's just slightly better than that -
but again you get stuck.

14:57.848 --> 15:02.563
If you have to come up to this stage, you
have to give up the staircase.

15:02.759 --> 15:06.530
You think that you have achieved a lot
because now you have a settled family

15:06.731 --> 15:11.463
and settled children and you are only worried
about your own children all the time.

15:11.664 --> 15:20.464
No, it's another temptation; it's [a] very
big temptation.

15:22.607 --> 15:30.977
So on the great occasion of the birth
of Christ we have to say to ourselves

15:31.178 --> 15:37.626
that we are dedicated to Sahaja Yoga,

15:39.533 --> 15:45.196
that's the main thing, everything is
subsidiary.

15:46.691 --> 15:52.499
I hope you'll understand that we are now

15:52.700 --> 15:56.701
on the cusp of a wave from where we are
going to jump onto another wave,

15:56.902 --> 16:02.280
which will be much higher than this, but
you must have the worthiness.

16:02.481 --> 16:07.269
If you are not sea-worthy you’ll be
drowned,

16:09.295 --> 16:13.757
so we have to develop that worthiness -
and we have Christ before us.

16:13.958 --> 16:18.086
What a life, what a life it was.

16:18.287 --> 16:23.455
He lived like a human being in a humble
way and what a life.

16:23.656 --> 16:32.684
And how truthfully forthright He was to say
everything so clearly.

16:32.885 --> 16:35.558
In the same way you'll have your strength

16:35.759 --> 16:39.627
when you will know that you are much more
than a married man

16:39.828 --> 16:44.957
and you are much more than your nationality.

16:45.158 --> 16:48.564
You are a higher personality,

16:48.765 --> 16:55.125
a Sahaja yogi who is dwelling in the bliss
of the Kingdom of God.

16:55.326 --> 17:02.331
That's the bliss, not the family bliss and
the children bliss, but the bliss of God.

17:02.532 --> 17:05.629
May God bless you.
