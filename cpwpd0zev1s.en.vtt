00:00:16.046 --> 00:00:23.463
Today we have assembled here to celebrate
the birth of Christ.

00:00:24.925 --> 00:00:33.292
When you think of His birth one knows that
He was born in a very humble place

00:00:34.246 --> 00:00:39.850
and all His life He lived in a very humble
way.

00:00:42.095 --> 00:00:50.276
Also, as Sahaja yogis, you know that He was
the incarnation of Shri Ganesha

00:00:50.453 --> 00:00:57.449
which is, in essence, is innocence and He
was

00:01:00.548 --> 00:01:10.062
crucified due to the stupid understanding
of blind people.

00:01:12.753 --> 00:01:19.563
He was the eternal child and it’s so sad
that

00:01:20.506 --> 00:01:31.488
when we talk about Christ and Christianity

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:36.540
we feel that Christianity has gone just
the other way around,

00:01:36.741 --> 00:01:40.719
on the other side of Christ.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.940
If one is construction, the another is
destruction

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:52.021
and if one is innocence, another is cunning.

00:01:52.222 --> 00:01:58.905
If you see the Christian nations, it's very
surprising where we have got Christianity

00:01:59.106 --> 00:02:07.072
in its practice; it's very surprising that
innocence has no place, no respect,

00:02:07.273 --> 00:02:16.080
chastity has no place, no respect, which
was the essence of Christ,

00:02:16.281 --> 00:02:20.280
He was made of it.

00:02:23.901 --> 00:02:30.014
It is sometimes shocking how these so-called
Christian nations

00:02:30.214 --> 00:02:34.151
have maligned Christ to that extent

00:02:36.598 --> 00:02:41.524
and how they have ruined so many people
with their stupid ideas

00:02:41.725 --> 00:02:48.788
of allowing people to indulge into all kinds
of filthy things.

00:02:50.432 --> 00:02:55.017
And the second point is very important,
to see how

00:02:55.218 --> 00:03:00.188
He was born in a very humble abode,

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:04.381
He lived in a very humble way.

00:03:04.946 --> 00:03:10.644
He was a son of a carpenter so He lived
like a carpenter,

00:03:14.337 --> 00:03:21.306
but in the Western life people are so
materialistic

00:03:21.507 --> 00:03:27.590
and to them to live lavishly, to show off
their wealth

00:03:27.791 --> 00:03:32.991
and to plunder people, plunder countries
after countries

00:03:33.192 --> 00:03:37.843
for material gain is a common thing.

00:03:38.044 --> 00:03:46.294
They do not feel also that it is wrong and
they are quite proud of it.

00:03:46.495 --> 00:03:52.148
And the third great thing about Christ was
that

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:58.942
He wanted people to love each other and
to be humble,

00:03:59.143 --> 00:04:07.425
but the arrogance and the cruelty that one
has seen of the Christian nations

00:04:07.626 --> 00:04:14.846
one cannot understand how are they anywhere
near Christ.

00:04:15.864 --> 00:04:21.647
He has said about, "Blessed are those who
are meek".

00:04:21.848 --> 00:04:27.566
Where are those meek people living? Not
in the western countries,

00:04:27.767 --> 00:04:32.967
not in the countries where Christ is
worshipped, where temples are raised,

00:04:33.168 --> 00:04:41.261
are raised in His honor and have been
worshipping the Mother for so many years.

00:04:41.462 --> 00:04:46.865
What a sinful thing it is to do to Christ.

00:04:47.311 --> 00:04:53.667
Is the greatest sin that we say that we are
following Christ

00:04:53.868 --> 00:04:57.126
and to do all these horrible things,

00:04:57.308 --> 00:05:03.222
all such people have to go to hell
of the worst type, no doubt about it.

00:05:03.423 --> 00:05:07.000
They may not realize but they are already
getting into it,

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:10.515
they are already having this problem.

00:05:10.716 --> 00:05:16.259
They are worse than people who crucified
Christ, this is every-day crucifixion.

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:21.938
So it's a great occasion today to celebrate

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:28.184
the birth of Christ, who came on this earth
to help us in our resurrection,

00:05:28.385 --> 00:05:32.218
to talk about the Holy Ghost.

00:05:32.918 --> 00:05:38.565
He was bearing all the brunt of the people,
everything,

00:05:38.766 --> 00:05:43.616
but the outcome of that life is so
horrifying that sometimes I get worried

00:05:43.817 --> 00:05:48.423
that I hope they don't make something out
of Me like that.

00:05:48.624 --> 00:05:53.901
It is such a stupid ideas people have
in the west,

00:05:54.102 --> 00:05:59.650
that for any sensible man he can see the way

00:05:59.851 --> 00:06:07.544
they are emotional, romantic, nonsensical.
They have no respect

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:12.787
for themselves and to follow Christ with
that kind of an attitude is, I think is,

00:06:12.988 --> 00:06:18.984
they have no business, they have no right,
but it has happened.

00:06:19.185 --> 00:06:25.847
Now you people are born again as Christ
has said, "You are to be born again".

00:06:26.048 --> 00:06:31.843
You have achieved that state which Christ
was talking about.

00:06:32.044 --> 00:06:38.697
You are the special type of people. I never
had such hopes I must say.

00:06:38.898 --> 00:06:44.911
The first encounter was so horrible that I
didn't think that many will come out of it

00:06:45.112 --> 00:06:48.519
but so many of you have come out of it

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:55.314
and have really glorified the name of
Christ, no doubt about it, and keep it up.

00:06:55.515 --> 00:06:58.429
I would request you now to know that you
are Sahaja yogis

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:01.839
and that you are the followers of Christ.

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:07.031
You are the Gnostics as described, you are
the ones who know

00:07:07.232 --> 00:07:12.886
and that's how you have to help people
to emancipate.

00:07:13.087 --> 00:07:21.327
It is very surprising that I saw that
the Western life,

00:07:21.528 --> 00:07:30.372
the stupid, destructive ideas, did not kill
the innocence.

00:07:30.573 --> 00:07:39.153
Like the clouds, all these affectations
were there

00:07:39.354 --> 00:07:44.306
but once the Kundalini rose the innocence
started expressing itself.

00:07:44.507 --> 00:07:53.394
But still, I would say that this kind
of lovey-dovey stuff

00:07:53.595 --> 00:07:59.806
must be given up. It is just most
un-Christian

00:08:00.007 --> 00:08:05.632
because if you see His life, it was a life
of a tapasvi,

00:08:05.833 --> 00:08:13.375
a man who lived in a very detached manner,
in nisanga.

00:08:13.576 --> 00:08:17.927
So for Sahaja yogis who are coming from
Christian life

00:08:18.128 --> 00:08:22.554
have to understand if they have to get rid
of it, they should be like that.

00:08:22.755 --> 00:08:27.302
But on the contrary, see the interest
in marriages,

00:08:27.503 --> 00:08:34.621
the interest in all this kind of thing and
after marriage - is a bit too much.

00:08:36.893 --> 00:08:41.922
It is so much in it, I mean it’s absurd,
it's absurd in Sahaja Yoga.

00:08:42.123 --> 00:08:49.612
It's one of the lifestyles, is alright, one
of the part, it's not everything;

00:08:49.813 --> 00:08:55.405
and it covers the whole entire personality
of a Christian personality.

00:08:55.606 --> 00:09:01.640
Not with Muslims or Hindus, I've seen that.
I mean, I'm married too.

00:09:01.841 --> 00:09:08.641
But it doesn't cover My whole entire being
with it. How can it?

00:09:08.842 --> 00:09:13.505
And that's the problem is - that once
marriage system starts, anything starts,

00:09:13.706 --> 00:09:18.803
“oh it becomes so important” and I'm faced
with problems all the time.

00:09:19.004 --> 00:09:22.025
The marriage is performed then letters will
be coming,

00:09:22.226 --> 00:09:24.967
“this has happened to my marriage”.
They must get married,

00:09:25.168 --> 00:09:28.034
nobody is such that, supposing now one is
finished,

00:09:28.243 --> 00:09:33.699
live without marriage, they cannot do it,
just can't live.

00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:37.146
Christ never got married.

00:09:37.347 --> 00:09:42.618
They cannot have that tapasvita in them
and they depend so much,

00:09:42.819 --> 00:09:46.282
they'll ruin their wives, they'll ruin
their husbands, they'll ruin Sahaja Yoga.

00:09:46.483 --> 00:09:49.218
They'll take them away - but it's something
surprising -

00:09:49.419 --> 00:09:56.358
the importance of Sahaja Yoga is so
minimized by this Christian mind,

00:09:56.876 --> 00:10:02.426
[that?] I don't know from where these ideas
have come to you.

00:10:04.452 --> 00:10:11.517
It's a juxtaposition as you can call it,
juxtaposition.

00:10:11.718 --> 00:10:17.163
There is no similarity between the life
Christ must have thought

00:10:17.364 --> 00:10:20.231
people would lead and the people are
leading.

00:10:20.455 --> 00:10:26.578
So it is necessary for Sahaja yogis to have
a dignity and a sense

00:10:26.779 --> 00:10:29.527
and to know that they are grounded
in Sahaja Yoga

00:10:29.728 --> 00:10:37.605
and marriage and all those things are just
subsidiary. It's not the end of life.

00:10:38.612 --> 00:10:44.427
And when I see that happening I am rather
surprised in Sahaja Yoga

00:10:44.628 --> 00:10:50.622
I have to marry people because I believe
that one should lead a proper married life.

00:10:50.823 --> 00:10:55.741
Because if you just take up a sanyasa
without going through this married life,

00:10:55.942 --> 00:11:00.122
you can be very much hypocritical.

00:11:00.323 --> 00:11:04.733
But that doesn't mean that marriage is
everything.

00:11:04.934 --> 00:11:11.700
It's not so important, it's just something
has to happen.

00:11:11.901 --> 00:11:16.227
It's not even important than any puja;

00:11:16.428 --> 00:11:21.973
it's not even important than praying to Me;

00:11:22.174 --> 00:11:26.138
it's not even important than meditating;

00:11:26.339 --> 00:11:33.189
it's not important at all than even eating
your food.

00:11:34.835 --> 00:11:39.148
The more I know you start making of it
you fall into the same trap

00:11:39.349 --> 00:11:42.516
from where I pulled you out.

00:11:43.373 --> 00:11:51.073
So as I, the other day I was telling people
about what they have to do

00:11:51.274 --> 00:11:59.312
about these caste system we have in India.
So in the society of Sahaja yogis,

00:11:59.513 --> 00:12:05.071
it should be only a one day affair or two
day affair at the most.

00:12:05.684 --> 00:12:11.140
But so much importance, husband, wives,
getting married,

00:12:11.333 --> 00:12:16.719
then solving their problems, I get
a headache with them.

00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:19.900
And they'll always come "my wife, you know,
she's like this,

00:12:20.101 --> 00:12:23.898
and wife's sister like that, and wife's
this".

00:12:24.099 --> 00:12:28.084
I mean, one should be ashamed even to say
that "my wife".

00:12:28.285 --> 00:12:34.049
In India nobody says like that. I don't
think anybody will say "my wife".

00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:40.072
It's not done. At the most they'll say
"my children's mother",

00:12:40.273 --> 00:12:45.777
and if you have no children you don't say
anything.

00:12:47.906 --> 00:12:55.509
So this is the doom from which you have
come out. Please try to understand.

00:12:56.455 --> 00:13:01.812
From hell we have come out, absolutely
wrong ideas we had,

00:13:01.981 --> 00:13:10.453
from there we have come out, now be
dignified, be sensible.

00:13:11.344 --> 00:13:16.049
An over-importance to such un-important
thing

00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:20.175
will not allow you to rise very high
in life.

00:13:20.376 --> 00:13:22.522
But I don't say you don't marry, you must
marry.

00:13:22.723 --> 00:13:28.656
Of course, if you have a Sahaja yogini who
is also a good Sahaja yogini and she knows

00:13:28.857 --> 00:13:34.044
about Sahaja Yoga and then of course you
are helped much more, definitely.

00:13:34.212 --> 00:13:41.632
You get much more power, much more
understanding, much more joy

00:13:41.833 --> 00:13:47.529
and it's very good but the entire
relationship is so important

00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:53.802
on small, small things, this is just beyond
Me to understand.

00:13:54.003 --> 00:13:59.030
Then I see that then the girls fall in love
with the man whom they marry, finished;

00:13:59.231 --> 00:14:02.731
the man is finished, the woman is finished.

00:14:03.376 --> 00:14:10.519
Today I am taking this great occasion
to tell you

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:16.609
that Christ was born to Immaculata;

00:14:20.888 --> 00:14:26.320
and that's how I have given you your second
birth

00:14:28.044 --> 00:14:31.529
and you are so pure.

00:14:32.108 --> 00:14:37.086
So all the impurities, you must see them
clearly.

00:14:37.287 --> 00:14:44.264
I know you don't like them but they still
creep from here and there.

00:14:44.465 --> 00:14:49.417
Of course if the society you see in the west
is a society which

00:14:49.618 --> 00:14:52.803
of course there is no family, no wife,
nothing of the kind,

00:14:53.004 --> 00:14:57.647
so it's just slightly better than that -
but again you get stuck.

00:14:57.848 --> 00:15:02.563
If you have to come up to this stage, you
have to give up the staircase.

00:15:02.759 --> 00:15:06.530
You think that you have achieved a lot
because now you have a settled family

00:15:06.731 --> 00:15:11.463
and settled children and you are only worried
about your own children all the time.

00:15:11.664 --> 00:15:20.464
No, it's another temptation; it's [a] very
big temptation.

00:15:22.607 --> 00:15:30.977
So on the great occasion of the birth
of Christ we have to say to ourselves

00:15:31.178 --> 00:15:37.626
that we are dedicated to Sahaja Yoga,

00:15:39.533 --> 00:15:45.196
that's the main thing, everything is
subsidiary.

00:15:46.691 --> 00:15:52.499
I hope you'll understand that we are now

00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:56.701
on the cusp of a wave from where we are
going to jump onto another wave,

00:15:56.902 --> 00:16:02.280
which will be much higher than this, but
you must have the worthiness.

00:16:02.481 --> 00:16:07.269
If you are not sea-worthy you’ll be
drowned,

00:16:09.295 --> 00:16:13.757
so we have to develop that worthiness -
and we have Christ before us.

00:16:13.958 --> 00:16:18.086
What a life, what a life it was.

00:16:18.287 --> 00:16:23.455
He lived like a human being in a humble
way and what a life.

00:16:23.656 --> 00:16:32.684
And how truthfully forthright He was to say
everything so clearly.

00:16:32.885 --> 00:16:35.558
In the same way you'll have your strength

00:16:35.759 --> 00:16:39.627
when you will know that you are much more
than a married man

00:16:39.828 --> 00:16:44.957
and you are much more than your nationality.

00:16:45.158 --> 00:16:48.564
You are a higher personality,

00:16:48.765 --> 00:16:55.125
a Sahaja yogi who is dwelling in the bliss
of the Kingdom of God.

00:16:55.326 --> 00:17:02.331
That's the bliss, not the family bliss and
the children bliss, but the bliss of God.

00:17:02.532 --> 00:17:05.629
May God bless you.
