WEBVTT

04:29.349 --> 04:35.397
With love all kinds of creative action takes place.

04:35.693 --> 04:39.460
You see how Raulbai has love for Me

04:39.900 --> 04:48.557
and in this place you all also got new
ideas of creating a beautiful thing.

04:48.734 --> 04:55.540
And as love will increase, your creativity
will develop.

04:55.780 --> 05:01.921
So the basis of all creativity, of Saraswati, is love.

05:02.366 --> 05:06.662
If there is no love there’s no creativity.

05:06.846 --> 05:10.068
It’s even in the deeper sense, if you see.

05:10.093 --> 05:14.958
People who have created all the scientific things

05:14.983 --> 05:19.083
are also out of love for the masses,
not for themselves.

05:19.158 --> 05:22.010
Nobody has produced anything for themselves.

05:22.164 --> 05:24.429
If they make something for themselves

05:24.454 --> 05:28.705
it has to become for universal use,
otherwise it has no meaning.

05:28.730 --> 05:33.002
Even if you say atom bomb
and all these things that are created from science,

05:33.027 --> 05:35.762
they are also very protective.

05:35.812 --> 05:41.158
If they had not created those, people would
not have taken out their minds from war.

05:41.183 --> 05:44.275
Now, nobody can think of having a big war.

05:44.309 --> 05:46.418
Of course, they are having cold wars,

05:46.443 --> 05:50.111
but that also will gradually stop, when
they will be fed up of it.

05:50.185 --> 05:54.150
So, all the activity on the right hand
side, of Saraswati,

05:54.380 --> 05:59.643
basically has to end up in love; starts
with love and ends up in love.

05:59.851 --> 06:04.558
Whichever does not end up in love coils
up and finishes off.

06:04.805 --> 06:06.257
It just disappears.

06:06.553 --> 06:11.439
So you can see that even matter, which is
not used for love,

06:11.488 --> 06:15.760
just finishes off. The basis has to be love.

06:15.821 --> 06:20.923
Otherwise all such matter that we create
which has angularity,

06:21.050 --> 06:27.974
which is not fitting into the mass media,
which is not appealing to the masses.

06:28.143 --> 06:31.896
Of course, it takes time, you have seen
that it takes time -

06:32.098 --> 06:38.243
but it does have that tendency always
to disappear in the thin air

06:38.329 --> 06:42.141
as soon as you find it does not appeal
to the masses.

06:42.222 --> 06:48.095
Now this love of, that we talk of, this
great love of God we talk of,

06:48.120 --> 06:51.759
we know it for definite through vibrations.

06:51.784 --> 06:53.886
People do not have vibrations,

06:53.911 --> 06:59.505
but still they can feel the vibrations
in a very unconscious way.

06:59.642 --> 07:02.985
All the great paintings of the world have vibrations.

07:03.010 --> 07:06.503
All the great creative works of the world have vibrations.

07:06.528 --> 07:10.895
Only those who have vibrations have been
sustained by time,

07:10.920 --> 07:13.368
otherwise all other things are destroyed.

07:13.472 --> 07:17.550
There must have been monuments
and horrible statues and horrible things

07:17.575 --> 07:19.844
that have been created long time back.

07:19.869 --> 07:24.770
But [they] were all destroyed by nature,
and they could not stand

07:24.879 --> 07:31.955
the impact of the Kala - that is
the destructive power of time.

07:32.116 --> 07:39.262
So, all that is sustaining, all that
is nurturing, all that is en-nobling,

07:39.455 --> 07:46.052
comes from this sense of love, which is
within us very much developed,

07:46.077 --> 07:50.071
but within others also, who are not yet realized.

07:50.096 --> 07:52.766
Ultimately the whole world has to realize

07:52.791 --> 07:59.126
that one has to go to that ultimate love
of God, otherwise it has no meaning.

07:59.151 --> 08:03.221
Now you have seen in art people have taken
to other methods

08:03.246 --> 08:07.664
of appealing to people by using cheap
things and very vulgar things,

08:07.689 --> 08:11.987
just to make people think that this is art.
But this will all disappear.

08:12.184 --> 08:17.333
It cannot sustain the impact of the time
as I told you, it cannot.

08:17.375 --> 08:20.431
Because the time will kill it. All these
things have to disappear

08:20.456 --> 08:22.433
and already you can see the result,

08:22.458 --> 08:25.851
how things are changing everywhere,
even in the West.

08:25.876 --> 08:29.625
So there is no need to be so much
disappointed with the West

08:29.650 --> 08:32.987
and to say that the Western world is a wasteland.

08:33.012 --> 08:37.006
It is going to be alright and it has to be done.

08:37.031 --> 08:41.680
Especially it has done lot of Puja
of Saraswati, I should say, in the West.

08:41.805 --> 08:45.760
Much more than they have done in India
because they have gone to learning

08:45.785 --> 08:48.639
and they have tried to find out so many things.

08:48.728 --> 08:52.928
But only thing they forgot that it is
a Goddess, Goddess of Learning.

08:53.100 --> 08:56.153
Everything comes from the Goddess.
That’s what they’ve forgotten.

08:56.178 --> 08:58.719
And that’'s why all the problems have been created.

08:58.744 --> 09:02.516
If there is no Spirit in your learning,
if there is no source

09:02.541 --> 09:05.939
of the Goddess in your learning, then it is
absolutely useless.

09:06.089 --> 09:11.534
If they had realized that there is
the Spirit that is working it out,

09:11.678 --> 09:15.076
they would not have gone that far.

09:15.884 --> 09:19.265
And that’s what I was warning the Indians, all through,

09:19.290 --> 09:22.813
that you are now taking to industrial
revolution in a way

09:22.926 --> 09:26.450
and to avoid all the complications
of industrial revolution,

09:26.667 --> 09:30.290
you must try to know the Spirit.

09:30.315 --> 09:34.677
If you do not know the Spirit you will have
the same problems as these people have.

09:34.811 --> 09:37.624
Because they are also human beings, you are
also human beings.

09:37.649 --> 09:40.738
You will also go the same way. At random
you will run

09:40.763 --> 09:45.313
and there will be problems, the same
problems as the Western people have.

09:45.512 --> 09:52.080
Now Saraswati's blessings are so many that
one cannot describe in such a short time.

09:52.298 --> 09:57.314
And the Surya has given us so many powers
that it is impossible

09:57.365 --> 10:01.669
to tell them even in one lecture, even
in ten lectures.

10:01.879 --> 10:07.528
But how we go against Surya and how we go
against Saraswati,

10:07.711 --> 10:12.133
while doing the worship of Saraswati, is
to be seen very clearly within ourselves.

10:12.311 --> 10:15.561
For example the Western people are very
fond of Surya

10:15.586 --> 10:20.241
because they have no Surya within. But
they go too far with it, as you know,

10:20.266 --> 10:23.911
and create complications within themselves of Surya.

10:24.010 --> 10:30.813
But the main thing that one has to achieve
through Surya is the light within,

10:31.093 --> 10:38.776
is the light within. And if Surya chakra
at the Agnya level

10:38.801 --> 10:44.441
is occupied by Lord Jesus Christ then it is
even more essential

10:44.568 --> 10:54.607
that the purity of life, what we call
‘Niti’, is the morality of life.

10:54.841 --> 11:01.190
Now morality itself has become very much
sort of an argument in the West.

11:01.339 --> 11:05.471
People don't have any sense of absolute morality.

11:05.564 --> 11:10.625
On vibrations of course you know. But
they have gone all against it.

11:10.714 --> 11:16.121
Those who are the worshippers of Jesus,
those who are the worshippers of the Surya,

11:16.322 --> 11:20.663
of the Saraswati have all gone against it.

11:21.097 --> 11:25.871
Against the powers of Surya, just disobeying it.

11:26.041 --> 11:30.118
Because you cannot be a Surya if you do not have

11:30.334 --> 11:34.354
a proper sense of morality and holiness.

11:34.594 --> 11:40.177
The Surya itself brings light, to see
everything clearly.

11:40.283 --> 11:42.836
So many qualities Surya has got.

11:42.917 --> 11:49.392
It dries up everything that is wet, dirty, filthy.

11:49.632 --> 11:53.802
It dries up all these places, which create parasites.

11:53.924 --> 11:56.679
But so many parasites are created in the West.

11:56.771 --> 12:00.896
Not only parasites, but there are horrible
cults and horrible things

12:01.023 --> 12:08.381
which have come into those countries
which is supposed to be full of light.

12:08.542 --> 12:15.999
And in that darkness they exist: darkness
about their Spirit,

12:16.199 --> 12:21.451
darkness about their own knowledge
and darkness about love.

12:21.740 --> 12:25.026
These three things have taken over in the places

12:25.051 --> 12:28.696
where you are supposed to love light.
Light doesn’t mean,

12:28.721 --> 12:32.706
light doesn’t mean what you see with your gross eyes.

12:32.731 --> 12:36.815
Light means from within - the Light of Love.

12:36.991 --> 12:40.455
That one should understand - Light of Love.

12:40.617 --> 12:45.548
And it's so soothing, it’s so sweet, it’s
so beautiful, it’s so enamouring,

12:45.730 --> 12:51.811
it’s so abounding that unless and until
you can feel that light within you -

12:52.075 --> 12:56.633
that light which is of pure love, of purity,

12:56.890 --> 12:59.769
pure relationships, pure understanding.

12:59.918 --> 13:05.428
If you can develop that kind of a light within yourself,

13:06.224 --> 13:10.306
then the whole thing will be cleansed.

13:10.331 --> 13:15.871
'Wash me and I shall be whiter than snow.'

13:15.985 --> 13:20.344
This is what happens to you when you are
completely cleansed.

13:20.459 --> 13:29.005
The purest form of nature is within us.
The purest form of nature is within us.

13:29.206 --> 13:33.788
Our chakras are made out of that purest
form of nature.

13:34.052 --> 13:38.134
We are the only people who are spoiling it
by our mental thinking.

13:38.283 --> 13:42.474
Again the same Saraswati’s work. You are
going against Saraswati itself.

13:42.548 --> 13:47.277
Saraswati cleanses all that is impure in nature,

13:47.334 --> 13:51.839
while, with our brain activity, we are
spoiling all that.

13:52.000 --> 13:58.671
All our brain activity goes against pure intelligence.

13:59.125 --> 14:03.971
And that’s what one has to understand -
that this pure intelligence,

14:04.056 --> 14:10.371
is not to be soiled by our thinking. Our
thinking can make us so bumptious,

14:10.595 --> 14:21.226
so ego-oriented, so impure, that we can
really eat the poison

14:21.324 --> 14:26.009
and say 'what is wrong with it'?
Just the opposite of Saraswati.

14:26.187 --> 14:30.912
If Saraswati is within us, She gives us
Subuddhi, wisdom.

14:31.152 --> 14:34.625
And that is why to worship Saraswati,
to worship Surya

14:34.660 --> 14:38.318
we must have that clear vision as to
what we have to be,

14:38.343 --> 14:43.948
what we are doing, what filth we are
living in, what our mind is getting into.

14:44.079 --> 14:48.596
After all, we are here for emancipation
and not for just for pampering our ego

14:48.621 --> 14:51.782
and living with our filth that is with us.

14:51.807 --> 14:56.631
So this light has come within us and we
should try to rise above

14:56.739 --> 15:03.770
our own mental filth, which is being
created around us.

15:04.083 --> 15:10.846
Apart from that, you have to go higher
and understand

15:10.959 --> 15:17.290
that there is, within us, a thing called ego.

15:17.562 --> 15:21.070
And this ego is false, absolutely false.
You do not do anything.

15:21.095 --> 15:24.056
Actually when you turn your eyes here and there,

15:24.081 --> 15:29.777
when your attention is here and there
it is nothing but your ego is trying to overpower everyone.

15:29.802 --> 15:34.558
But actually, ego is an absolute falsehood

15:34.748 --> 15:40.937
because there is only one ego and that is
of God Almighty, Mahat-Ahamkara.

15:41.098 --> 15:46.938
There is no really any ego that exists. It's myth.

15:46.987 --> 15:51.385
It's a very big myth, because if you start
thinking you are doing everything -

15:51.410 --> 15:55.142
you are doing this, you are doing that -
which you are not doing;

15:55.167 --> 15:59.720
then this nonsensical ego comes in an
you start working it out,

15:59.745 --> 16:01.833
it can project in every direction.

16:01.858 --> 16:06.165
When it projects forward, it overpowers others,

16:06.306 --> 16:12.073
it tries to dominate others, tries to kill
others, becomes cruel.

16:12.163 --> 16:16.381
When it moves [to the] right side,
it becomes supraconscious.

16:16.430 --> 16:21.355
It starts seeing things, which are absurd,
which are foolish, which are stupid.

16:21.459 --> 16:28.847
When it moves left side then it starts
talking - I mean, seeing things -

16:28.872 --> 16:35.710
yourself as a big man, as a big Christ
or as a big Devi

16:35.735 --> 16:40.272
or something like Adi Gurus and 'I am a very
great personality' - that is left sided.

16:40.326 --> 16:43.343
When it moves backwards, that is
the dangerous one.

16:43.383 --> 16:48.302
When people become gurus, which are ruining
other people.

16:48.535 --> 16:51.939
When their ego moves backwards then they
become gurus,

16:51.964 --> 16:54.481
they themselves have lots of defects in themselves

16:54.506 --> 16:57.895
and they try to pull people into those horrible stuff,

16:57.920 --> 17:01.736
which is described as absolute Naraka.

17:01.914 --> 17:05.655
That’s how, is the movement of ego
on all the sides.

17:05.762 --> 17:10.928
Now when people try to use their right Vishuddhi

17:11.063 --> 17:14.633
that is to talk about themselves,
is the worst of all.

17:14.787 --> 17:17.637
Whatever type of ego you may have,

17:17.758 --> 17:22.552
if you start boasting about it and talking
about it, then it encircles,

17:22.608 --> 17:28.676
thickens the walls of ego so much, that
it is impossible to penetrate into that.

17:28.854 --> 17:32.298
Because such a person is completely
satisfied with himself

17:32.323 --> 17:37.554
and he believes that he is so. And once he
starts believing into a nonsense like that,

17:37.592 --> 17:41.955
it's an impossibility, is an impossibility
to penetrate.

17:42.036 --> 17:48.636
So, when you boast about these things
or you talk big, be careful.

17:48.869 --> 17:53.435
You see, you know what I am, but how many
times do I say 'I am that'?

17:53.460 --> 17:57.589
Even if I say once, it makes tremendous
vibrations for you.

17:57.768 --> 18:02.659
But how many times do I say so?
At the most if you say something, I say 'yes'.

18:02.860 --> 18:04.359
But I don't say that.

18:04.441 --> 18:07.508
If I say it loudly, I don't know what may happen.

18:07.533 --> 18:10.254
The whole thing might be blasted with truth.

18:10.417 --> 18:14.308
So, one has to understand that
Mahat-Ahamkara is the one

18:14.333 --> 18:18.557
that acts, that works, that creates???.
Sometimes I shout at you.

18:18.582 --> 18:21.503
Immediately all the bhoots run away.
Just once I shout.

18:21.528 --> 18:25.056
Yesterday, you saw all the bhoots that were
coughing, they all ran away.

18:25.081 --> 18:28.892
Yesterday just I started. So you should understand

18:28.917 --> 18:31.961
that now you are a realized souls, you can
also do the same.

18:31.986 --> 18:34.483
Use your right Vishuddhi to shout at yourself,

18:34.508 --> 18:37.760
‘‘Now will you please stop boasting,
will you stop talking all this nonsense,

18:37.785 --> 18:42.613
will you stop showing off!'' Then it will stop.

18:42.766 --> 18:50.972
Now this thickening takes place by people
who really are active,

18:51.062 --> 18:54.517
who want to do something about it. Not that
they are not active, they want to do it.

18:54.542 --> 18:58.099
But they know only one way, is to act
through talking.

18:58.124 --> 19:01.467
They don't understand that there are inner ways

19:01.552 --> 19:05.773
by which you control it much more.

19:05.894 --> 19:10.437
Because they don't want to take to that,
they take to this talking.

19:10.694 --> 19:16.275
And once they take to talking and they talk
about it, the whole power flows away.

19:16.484 --> 19:20.629
But if they do not talk about it and keep
it within themselves.

19:20.972 --> 19:24.200
It’s alright, you can tell Me about your
experiences or anything,

19:24.225 --> 19:27.567
but if you start telling others, and
talking about it too much,

19:27.715 --> 19:32.253
then the powers that you have got will be
all disappearing gradually from you.

19:32.470 --> 19:36.632
And you will just come down to absolutely lowest level.

19:36.800 --> 19:40.043
So one should not too much talk that,
“I have this power,

19:40.068 --> 19:43.576
I have this power” or “I see this” or
“I do this,”

19:43.614 --> 19:48.081
which is a very wrong thing. I warn you,
don’t try to show off.

19:48.106 --> 19:50.742
Yes, you can talk about My powers.
It's all right.

19:50.927 --> 19:53.856
But don't try to talk about your powers.

19:54.058 --> 19:58.898
When it comes, of course, to talk
to somebody who is a negative person

19:59.017 --> 20:02.468
or to tell somebody, then you should say
that “we”, not “I”.

20:02.662 --> 20:08.722
“We” have, some of us have felt this power
within ourselves. We have seen people”.

20:08.763 --> 20:13.549
It may be you only, but you need not say,
'I' have. What you have to say is 'We'.

20:13.893 --> 20:19.946
Then you become the Mahat-Ahamkara. When
you say 'We', Yes, some of us', 'we do'.

20:20.187 --> 20:24.300
Like in Gregoire's book also I made it,
I saw to it,

20:24.325 --> 20:27.809
that he should not have many 'I's',
but he should have 'We'.

20:27.959 --> 20:31.864
'We think', 'we do', 'we'. Means, the whole
collective being,

20:31.889 --> 20:36.731
the whole collective organism, living
organism of Sahaja Yogis.

20:36.966 --> 20:39.411
So if you say, 'yes, some of us have got it',

20:39.436 --> 20:42.639
that means, you put yourself down,
but put all others above you.

20:42.751 --> 20:45.522
Say: 'Yes, some of us have. I know some
people have this.'

20:45.547 --> 20:50.305
That’'s the way one should do it. Because
if you have to overpower your ego,

20:50.330 --> 20:54.930
you must allow it to spread into everybody else.

20:55.014 --> 20:58.543
That’s how you will make it perfectly
all right, to make it spread.

20:58.568 --> 21:02.334
“We, all Sahaja Yogis, we all”.
But that pride is not there.

21:02.430 --> 21:05.900
I've seen that pride is not there.
Still it is very individualistic.

21:05.925 --> 21:10.207
If you start thinking, ''we Sahaja Yogis",
then what happens,

21:10.275 --> 21:13.507
that you become one personality,
one organization.

21:13.532 --> 21:16.919
But the person will look down upon
other people.

21:17.025 --> 21:22.393
He will see that this person is low, that
person is higher, that person is there.

21:22.587 --> 21:26.446
But he will not think, "'We' the Sahaja
Yogis, how beautiful we are.

21:26.646 --> 21:29.855
'We' the body of Sahaja Yoga, how beautiful we are."

21:29.920 --> 21:37.041
So always think in the words of 'we',

21:37.274 --> 21:42.107
so your ego will become much less,
much less, much less.

21:42.132 --> 21:45.882
And the same ego, which looked so funny
and absurd,

21:46.052 --> 21:50.917
will form tomorrow the Ekadesha.

21:52.561 --> 21:57.558
Today’s individual ego will merge into Ekadesha.

21:57.759 --> 22:02.987
But we all must remember to say 'we' all time.

22:03.082 --> 22:07.904
This is what is today's day, is a great day
for us to change,

22:07.979 --> 22:11.885
because the Sun has changed its mood, now.
Sun is coming this side.

22:11.910 --> 22:17.842
So let us welcome the Sun, coming
to the North now, this way.

22:17.884 --> 22:22.198
And for Australians to say that though
the Sun has gone,

22:22.223 --> 22:27.262
let us establish the Sun, the domain
of Sun, within ourselves.

22:27.465 --> 22:30.190
Because Sun never disappears
from our inside.

22:30.279 --> 22:35.210
So that is how we have to take a mood
by which we should think

22:35.235 --> 22:39.197
of one personality, all of us together,
all of us together.

22:39.222 --> 22:45.091
And anybody who tries to be something
separate or different, he will drop out.

22:45.116 --> 22:48.218
I will drop him out. Whatever it may be,
it will drop out.

22:48.243 --> 22:52.482
So you just don’t worry: anybody who tries
to be singled out or anything.

22:52.507 --> 22:56.318
Everybody must do whatever they like,
to nurture the whole,

22:56.343 --> 22:59.625
to help the whole, to emancipate the whole.

22:59.650 --> 23:04.672
But not to, in anyway, put anyone down. Always.

23:04.883 --> 23:08.683
Because this is not the way the Sahaja Yoga is.

23:08.708 --> 23:11.249
Sahaja Yoga only works in collectivity.

23:11.274 --> 23:15.993
And the one who has developed
this permeating spirit,

23:16.234 --> 23:19.368
is a real Sahaja Yogi. Who has not, is not!

23:19.393 --> 23:22.800
Whatever you may think of yourself, I have
nothing to say.

23:22.825 --> 23:26.445
But this permeating personality, which
moves from places to places,

23:26.470 --> 23:29.290
whether you talk or not. Like your Mother is.

23:29.315 --> 23:32.397
Whether I meet you or not, makes
no difference, but I am permeating

23:32.422 --> 23:36.908
through all of you, by little, little
things, also, I am there with you.

23:37.081 --> 23:41.163
So like that, try to permeate into each
other and see the beauty.

23:41.188 --> 23:45.608
And you’ll enjoy yourself the best because
that is the biggest thing.

23:45.825 --> 23:48.749
That's the biggest thing that is
to be achieved.

23:48.774 --> 23:54.691
Because this ego you know makes you like a
nutshell and you just cannot have a rapport

23:54.716 --> 24:00.653
with that beauty of permeation and just see
how the notes move into each other.

24:00.678 --> 24:05.961
It will be a great idea today, it’s great
thing today we are having Puja in Dhulia.

24:06.674 --> 24:10.642
Like the Dhulia means the dust, dust.

24:10.668 --> 24:15.731
And one day I had written in childhood,
a poem, I remember.

24:15.756 --> 24:18.900
Very interesting poem it was - I don't know
whether it is lost -

24:18.925 --> 24:23.466
but which said that, "I want to be like
a dust particle

24:23.582 --> 24:27.402
which moves with the wind. It goes everywhere.

24:27.427 --> 24:33.326
Can go, sit on the head of a king, or can
go and fall at the feet of someone.

24:33.509 --> 24:39.689
And it can go and sit on a little flower,
and it can go and sit everywhere.

24:39.882 --> 24:44.511
But I want to be a particle of dust
that is fragrant,

24:44.688 --> 24:49.149
that is nourishing, that is enlightening."

24:49.422 --> 24:51.818
Like that, I had written a very beautiful poem,

24:51.843 --> 24:56.112
I must have been about seven years of age,
I remember - 'To be a dust particle',

24:56.217 --> 25:00.228
I remember that very clearly, long time back,

25:00.253 --> 25:06.589
that "I should be a dust particle so that
I’ll permeate into people."

25:06.815 --> 25:10.573
Which is a very big thing - to become
a dust particle of that kind.

25:10.598 --> 25:15.196
Whatever you touch, you see, that becomes enlivened,

25:15.389 --> 25:23.172
whatever you just feel, that has fragrance.
It’s such a great thing to be like that.

25:23.357 --> 25:27.601
And that was My desire, and it has been achieved.

25:27.711 --> 25:32.350
At that young age, I had this idea
of becoming a dust particle

25:32.417 --> 25:37.403
and today just while talking to you,
I remembered that I wanted to be that,

25:37.428 --> 25:41.248
and that is what this place is.
And Raulbai is like that.

25:41.447 --> 25:44.501
She’s a very simple woman, very simple woman,

25:44.623 --> 25:50.423
and she lives like a very simple person but
she has a sense of permeation.

25:50.607 --> 25:54.113
And now there are so many Sahaja Yogis,
yesterday who came.

25:54.138 --> 25:56.730
I am sure that they will take up Sahaja
Yoga very well.

25:56.755 --> 26:01.987
And there are lots of Sahaja Yogis from
Dhulia now,

26:02.012 --> 26:04.414
and I am sure there are going to be more people.

26:04.439 --> 26:07.722
I hope you have met all of them. Make
friends with all of them.

26:07.747 --> 26:10.820
Try to know them who they are. They may
not know English -

26:10.845 --> 26:14.846
so get somebody to translate. Talk to them
and be nice to them,

26:14.871 --> 26:18.550
be friendly with them. I wanted you to meet
them for permeation.

26:18.575 --> 26:21.664
You should know who are the people here,
who are in Nasik.

26:21.689 --> 26:24.842
Because somehow we never meet the Sahaja
Yogis, you see,

26:24.867 --> 26:27.670
who are in that particular place, and
when we go back

26:27.695 --> 26:30.284
we have only one or two addresses.
It is not a good idea.

26:30.309 --> 26:35.759
Try to see how many people there are.
Ask questions about them, and all that.

26:35.784 --> 26:41.090
This permeation is only possible when your
ego starts permeating all around,

26:41.249 --> 26:45.714
and this is the way to overcome
the problems of the right side

26:45.739 --> 26:48.125
and that is how to worship Saraswati.

26:48.157 --> 26:50.720
Because Saraswati has a veena in Her hand

26:50.745 --> 26:54.862
and that veena is the primordial
instrument, which She plays

26:54.887 --> 26:57.808
like music, and the music penetrates
into the heart.

26:57.833 --> 27:00.459
You don't know how it goes into you and how
it works out.

27:00.484 --> 27:05.600
And that’'s how a person who is a Sahaja Yogi

27:05.625 --> 27:08.434
should permeate like music into other people.

27:08.638 --> 27:13.415
She has so many qualities, as I told you,
which cannot be described in one lecture.

27:13.609 --> 27:21.512
But one of the greatest qualities of Hers
is that She ends up into subtler things.

27:21.689 --> 27:27.003
Like the Mother Earth will end up into fragrance.

27:27.180 --> 27:31.119
Music will end up into melodies,

27:31.144 --> 27:34.852
like that whatever She creates ends up
into something greater.

27:34.877 --> 27:38.905
Matter, whatever She produces, ends up
into aesthetics.

27:38.930 --> 27:42.343
If matter does not have aesthetics then it is gross.

27:42.560 --> 27:46.103
Like that everything. Now you will say,
"What is water?"

27:46.128 --> 27:51.735
Water becomes the river Ganges.
These are the subtler [things].

27:51.760 --> 27:55.994
So the matter gets into subtler thing
because it has to permeate,

27:56.019 --> 28:00.461
it has to permeate. So everything
whatever it is.

28:00.578 --> 28:07.286
And the best of all is the air -that air
becomes the vibrations.

28:10.328 --> 28:14.500
So you can see how, whatever has come out
from this matter,

28:14.525 --> 28:19.866
from these five elements, becomes that subtle thing.

28:19.980 --> 28:25.143
Of course, the left and right side both
work it out because the love

28:25.375 --> 28:31.934
has to work on this and when love acts
on matter it becomes that,

28:32.112 --> 28:35.510
and that is how one has to look at your own lives,

28:35.535 --> 28:42.330
to make it a beautiful combination of love and matter.

28:42.476 --> 28:45.403
May God bless you!

28:46.286 --> 28:49.114
(Marathi)
