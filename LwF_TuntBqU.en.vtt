00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:35.397
With love all kinds of creative action takes place.

00:04:35.693 --> 00:04:39.460
You see how Raulbai has love for Me

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:48.557
and in this place you all also got new
ideas of creating a beautiful thing.

00:04:48.734 --> 00:04:55.540
And as love will increase, your creativity
will develop.

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:01.921
So the basis of all creativity, of Saraswati, is love.

00:05:02.366 --> 00:05:06.662
If there is no love there’s no creativity.

00:05:06.846 --> 00:05:10.068
It’s even in the deeper sense, if you see.

00:05:10.093 --> 00:05:14.958
People who have created all the scientific things

00:05:14.983 --> 00:05:19.083
are also out of love for the masses,
not for themselves.

00:05:19.158 --> 00:05:22.010
Nobody has produced anything for themselves.

00:05:22.164 --> 00:05:24.429
If they make something for themselves

00:05:24.454 --> 00:05:28.705
it has to become for universal use,
otherwise it has no meaning.

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:33.002
Even if you say atom bomb
and all these things that are created from science,

00:05:33.027 --> 00:05:35.762
they are also very protective.

00:05:35.812 --> 00:05:41.158
If they had not created those, people would
not have taken out their minds from war.

00:05:41.183 --> 00:05:44.275
Now, nobody can think of having a big war.

00:05:44.309 --> 00:05:46.418
Of course, they are having cold wars,

00:05:46.443 --> 00:05:50.111
but that also will gradually stop, when
they will be fed up of it.

00:05:50.185 --> 00:05:54.150
So, all the activity on the right hand
side, of Saraswati,

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:59.643
basically has to end up in love; starts
with love and ends up in love.

00:05:59.851 --> 00:06:04.558
Whichever does not end up in love coils
up and finishes off.

00:06:04.805 --> 00:06:06.257
It just disappears.

00:06:06.553 --> 00:06:11.439
So you can see that even matter, which is
not used for love,

00:06:11.488 --> 00:06:15.760
just finishes off. The basis has to be love.

00:06:15.821 --> 00:06:20.923
Otherwise all such matter that we create
which has angularity,

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:27.974
which is not fitting into the mass media,
which is not appealing to the masses.

00:06:28.143 --> 00:06:31.896
Of course, it takes time, you have seen
that it takes time -

00:06:32.098 --> 00:06:38.243
but it does have that tendency always
to disappear in the thin air

00:06:38.329 --> 00:06:42.141
as soon as you find it does not appeal
to the masses.

00:06:42.222 --> 00:06:48.095
Now this love of, that we talk of, this
great love of God we talk of,

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:51.759
we know it for definite through vibrations.

00:06:51.784 --> 00:06:53.886
People do not have vibrations,

00:06:53.911 --> 00:06:59.505
but still they can feel the vibrations
in a very unconscious way.

00:06:59.642 --> 00:07:02.985
All the great paintings of the world have vibrations.

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:06.503
All the great creative works of the world have vibrations.

00:07:06.528 --> 00:07:10.895
Only those who have vibrations have been
sustained by time,

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:13.368
otherwise all other things are destroyed.

00:07:13.472 --> 00:07:17.550
There must have been monuments
and horrible statues and horrible things

00:07:17.575 --> 00:07:19.844
that have been created long time back.

00:07:19.869 --> 00:07:24.770
But [they] were all destroyed by nature,
and they could not stand

00:07:24.879 --> 00:07:31.955
the impact of the Kala - that is
the destructive power of time.

00:07:32.116 --> 00:07:39.262
So, all that is sustaining, all that
is nurturing, all that is en-nobling,

00:07:39.455 --> 00:07:46.052
comes from this sense of love, which is
within us very much developed,

00:07:46.077 --> 00:07:50.071
but within others also, who are not yet realized.

00:07:50.096 --> 00:07:52.766
Ultimately the whole world has to realize

00:07:52.791 --> 00:07:59.126
that one has to go to that ultimate love
of God, otherwise it has no meaning.

00:07:59.151 --> 00:08:03.221
Now you have seen in art people have taken
to other methods

00:08:03.246 --> 00:08:07.664
of appealing to people by using cheap
things and very vulgar things,

00:08:07.689 --> 00:08:11.987
just to make people think that this is art.
But this will all disappear.

00:08:12.184 --> 00:08:17.333
It cannot sustain the impact of the time
as I told you, it cannot.

00:08:17.375 --> 00:08:20.431
Because the time will kill it. All these
things have to disappear

00:08:20.456 --> 00:08:22.433
and already you can see the result,

00:08:22.458 --> 00:08:25.851
how things are changing everywhere,
even in the West.

00:08:25.876 --> 00:08:29.625
So there is no need to be so much
disappointed with the West

00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:32.987
and to say that the Western world is a wasteland.

00:08:33.012 --> 00:08:37.006
It is going to be alright and it has to be done.

00:08:37.031 --> 00:08:41.680
Especially it has done lot of Puja
of Saraswati, I should say, in the West.

00:08:41.805 --> 00:08:45.760
Much more than they have done in India
because they have gone to learning

00:08:45.785 --> 00:08:48.639
and they have tried to find out so many things.

00:08:48.728 --> 00:08:52.928
But only thing they forgot that it is
a Goddess, Goddess of Learning.

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:56.153
Everything comes from the Goddess.
That’s what they’ve forgotten.

00:08:56.178 --> 00:08:58.719
And that’'s why all the problems have been created.

00:08:58.744 --> 00:09:02.516
If there is no Spirit in your learning,
if there is no source

00:09:02.541 --> 00:09:05.939
of the Goddess in your learning, then it is
absolutely useless.

00:09:06.089 --> 00:09:11.534
If they had realized that there is
the Spirit that is working it out,

00:09:11.678 --> 00:09:15.076
they would not have gone that far.

00:09:15.884 --> 00:09:19.265
And that’s what I was warning the Indians, all through,

00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:22.813
that you are now taking to industrial
revolution in a way

00:09:22.926 --> 00:09:26.450
and to avoid all the complications
of industrial revolution,

00:09:26.667 --> 00:09:30.290
you must try to know the Spirit.

00:09:30.315 --> 00:09:34.677
If you do not know the Spirit you will have
the same problems as these people have.

00:09:34.811 --> 00:09:37.624
Because they are also human beings, you are
also human beings.

00:09:37.649 --> 00:09:40.738
You will also go the same way. At random
you will run

00:09:40.763 --> 00:09:45.313
and there will be problems, the same
problems as the Western people have.

00:09:45.512 --> 00:09:52.080
Now Saraswati's blessings are so many that
one cannot describe in such a short time.

00:09:52.298 --> 00:09:57.314
And the Surya has given us so many powers
that it is impossible

00:09:57.365 --> 00:10:01.669
to tell them even in one lecture, even
in ten lectures.

00:10:01.879 --> 00:10:07.528
But how we go against Surya and how we go
against Saraswati,

00:10:07.711 --> 00:10:12.133
while doing the worship of Saraswati, is
to be seen very clearly within ourselves.

00:10:12.311 --> 00:10:15.561
For example the Western people are very
fond of Surya

00:10:15.586 --> 00:10:20.241
because they have no Surya within. But
they go too far with it, as you know,

00:10:20.266 --> 00:10:23.911
and create complications within themselves of Surya.

00:10:24.010 --> 00:10:30.813
But the main thing that one has to achieve
through Surya is the light within,

00:10:31.093 --> 00:10:38.776
is the light within. And if Surya chakra
at the Agnya level

00:10:38.801 --> 00:10:44.441
is occupied by Lord Jesus Christ then it is
even more essential

00:10:44.568 --> 00:10:54.607
that the purity of life, what we call
‘Niti’, is the morality of life.

00:10:54.841 --> 00:11:01.190
Now morality itself has become very much
sort of an argument in the West.

00:11:01.339 --> 00:11:05.471
People don't have any sense of absolute morality.

00:11:05.564 --> 00:11:10.625
On vibrations of course you know. But
they have gone all against it.

00:11:10.714 --> 00:11:16.121
Those who are the worshippers of Jesus,
those who are the worshippers of the Surya,

00:11:16.322 --> 00:11:20.663
of the Saraswati have all gone against it.

00:11:21.097 --> 00:11:25.871
Against the powers of Surya, just disobeying it.

00:11:26.041 --> 00:11:30.118
Because you cannot be a Surya if you do not have

00:11:30.334 --> 00:11:34.354
a proper sense of morality and holiness.

00:11:34.594 --> 00:11:40.177
The Surya itself brings light, to see
everything clearly.

00:11:40.283 --> 00:11:42.836
So many qualities Surya has got.

00:11:42.917 --> 00:11:49.392
It dries up everything that is wet, dirty, filthy.

00:11:49.632 --> 00:11:53.802
It dries up all these places, which create parasites.

00:11:53.924 --> 00:11:56.679
But so many parasites are created in the West.

00:11:56.771 --> 00:12:00.896
Not only parasites, but there are horrible
cults and horrible things

00:12:01.023 --> 00:12:08.381
which have come into those countries
which is supposed to be full of light.

00:12:08.542 --> 00:12:15.999
And in that darkness they exist: darkness
about their Spirit,

00:12:16.199 --> 00:12:21.451
darkness about their own knowledge
and darkness about love.

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:25.026
These three things have taken over in the places

00:12:25.051 --> 00:12:28.696
where you are supposed to love light.
Light doesn’t mean,

00:12:28.721 --> 00:12:32.706
light doesn’t mean what you see with your gross eyes.

00:12:32.731 --> 00:12:36.815
Light means from within - the Light of Love.

00:12:36.991 --> 00:12:40.455
That one should understand - Light of Love.

00:12:40.617 --> 00:12:45.548
And it's so soothing, it’s so sweet, it’s
so beautiful, it’s so enamouring,

00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:51.811
it’s so abounding that unless and until
you can feel that light within you -

00:12:52.075 --> 00:12:56.633
that light which is of pure love, of purity,

00:12:56.890 --> 00:12:59.769
pure relationships, pure understanding.

00:12:59.918 --> 00:13:05.428
If you can develop that kind of a light within yourself,

00:13:06.224 --> 00:13:10.306
then the whole thing will be cleansed.

00:13:10.331 --> 00:13:15.871
'Wash me and I shall be whiter than snow.'

00:13:15.985 --> 00:13:20.344
This is what happens to you when you are
completely cleansed.

00:13:20.459 --> 00:13:29.005
The purest form of nature is within us.
The purest form of nature is within us.

00:13:29.206 --> 00:13:33.788
Our chakras are made out of that purest
form of nature.

00:13:34.052 --> 00:13:38.134
We are the only people who are spoiling it
by our mental thinking.

00:13:38.283 --> 00:13:42.474
Again the same Saraswati’s work. You are
going against Saraswati itself.

00:13:42.548 --> 00:13:47.277
Saraswati cleanses all that is impure in nature,

00:13:47.334 --> 00:13:51.839
while, with our brain activity, we are
spoiling all that.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:58.671
All our brain activity goes against pure intelligence.

00:13:59.125 --> 00:14:03.971
And that’s what one has to understand -
that this pure intelligence,

00:14:04.056 --> 00:14:10.371
is not to be soiled by our thinking. Our
thinking can make us so bumptious,

00:14:10.595 --> 00:14:21.226
so ego-oriented, so impure, that we can
really eat the poison

00:14:21.324 --> 00:14:26.009
and say 'what is wrong with it'?
Just the opposite of Saraswati.

00:14:26.187 --> 00:14:30.912
If Saraswati is within us, She gives us
Subuddhi, wisdom.

00:14:31.152 --> 00:14:34.625
And that is why to worship Saraswati,
to worship Surya

00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:38.318
we must have that clear vision as to
what we have to be,

00:14:38.343 --> 00:14:43.948
what we are doing, what filth we are
living in, what our mind is getting into.

00:14:44.079 --> 00:14:48.596
After all, we are here for emancipation
and not for just for pampering our ego

00:14:48.621 --> 00:14:51.782
and living with our filth that is with us.

00:14:51.807 --> 00:14:56.631
So this light has come within us and we
should try to rise above

00:14:56.739 --> 00:15:03.770
our own mental filth, which is being
created around us.

00:15:04.083 --> 00:15:10.846
Apart from that, you have to go higher
and understand

00:15:10.959 --> 00:15:17.290
that there is, within us, a thing called ego.

00:15:17.562 --> 00:15:21.070
And this ego is false, absolutely false.
You do not do anything.

00:15:21.095 --> 00:15:24.056
Actually when you turn your eyes here and there,

00:15:24.081 --> 00:15:29.777
when your attention is here and there
it is nothing but your ego is trying to overpower everyone.

00:15:29.802 --> 00:15:34.558
But actually, ego is an absolute falsehood

00:15:34.748 --> 00:15:40.937
because there is only one ego and that is
of God Almighty, Mahat-Ahamkara.

00:15:41.098 --> 00:15:46.938
There is no really any ego that exists. It's myth.

00:15:46.987 --> 00:15:51.385
It's a very big myth, because if you start
thinking you are doing everything -

00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:55.142
you are doing this, you are doing that -
which you are not doing;

00:15:55.167 --> 00:15:59.720
then this nonsensical ego comes in an
you start working it out,

00:15:59.745 --> 00:16:01.833
it can project in every direction.

00:16:01.858 --> 00:16:06.165
When it projects forward, it overpowers others,

00:16:06.306 --> 00:16:12.073
it tries to dominate others, tries to kill
others, becomes cruel.

00:16:12.163 --> 00:16:16.381
When it moves [to the] right side,
it becomes supraconscious.

00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:21.355
It starts seeing things, which are absurd,
which are foolish, which are stupid.

00:16:21.459 --> 00:16:28.847
When it moves left side then it starts
talking - I mean, seeing things -

00:16:28.872 --> 00:16:35.710
yourself as a big man, as a big Christ
or as a big Devi

00:16:35.735 --> 00:16:40.272
or something like Adi Gurus and 'I am a very
great personality' - that is left sided.

00:16:40.326 --> 00:16:43.343
When it moves backwards, that is
the dangerous one.

00:16:43.383 --> 00:16:48.302
When people become gurus, which are ruining
other people.

00:16:48.535 --> 00:16:51.939
When their ego moves backwards then they
become gurus,

00:16:51.964 --> 00:16:54.481
they themselves have lots of defects in themselves

00:16:54.506 --> 00:16:57.895
and they try to pull people into those horrible stuff,

00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:01.736
which is described as absolute Naraka.

00:17:01.914 --> 00:17:05.655
That’s how, is the movement of ego
on all the sides.

00:17:05.762 --> 00:17:10.928
Now when people try to use their right Vishuddhi

00:17:11.063 --> 00:17:14.633
that is to talk about themselves,
is the worst of all.

00:17:14.787 --> 00:17:17.637
Whatever type of ego you may have,

00:17:17.758 --> 00:17:22.552
if you start boasting about it and talking
about it, then it encircles,

00:17:22.608 --> 00:17:28.676
thickens the walls of ego so much, that
it is impossible to penetrate into that.

00:17:28.854 --> 00:17:32.298
Because such a person is completely
satisfied with himself

00:17:32.323 --> 00:17:37.554
and he believes that he is so. And once he
starts believing into a nonsense like that,

00:17:37.592 --> 00:17:41.955
it's an impossibility, is an impossibility
to penetrate.

00:17:42.036 --> 00:17:48.636
So, when you boast about these things
or you talk big, be careful.

00:17:48.869 --> 00:17:53.435
You see, you know what I am, but how many
times do I say 'I am that'?

00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:57.589
Even if I say once, it makes tremendous
vibrations for you.

00:17:57.768 --> 00:18:02.659
But how many times do I say so?
At the most if you say something, I say 'yes'.

00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:04.359
But I don't say that.

00:18:04.441 --> 00:18:07.508
If I say it loudly, I don't know what may happen.

00:18:07.533 --> 00:18:10.254
The whole thing might be blasted with truth.

00:18:10.417 --> 00:18:14.308
So, one has to understand that
Mahat-Ahamkara is the one

00:18:14.333 --> 00:18:18.557
that acts, that works, that creates???.
Sometimes I shout at you.

00:18:18.582 --> 00:18:21.503
Immediately all the bhoots run away.
Just once I shout.

00:18:21.528 --> 00:18:25.056
Yesterday, you saw all the bhoots that were
coughing, they all ran away.

00:18:25.081 --> 00:18:28.892
Yesterday just I started. So you should understand

00:18:28.917 --> 00:18:31.961
that now you are a realized souls, you can
also do the same.

00:18:31.986 --> 00:18:34.483
Use your right Vishuddhi to shout at yourself,

00:18:34.508 --> 00:18:37.760
‘‘Now will you please stop boasting,
will you stop talking all this nonsense,

00:18:37.785 --> 00:18:42.613
will you stop showing off!'' Then it will stop.

00:18:42.766 --> 00:18:50.972
Now this thickening takes place by people
who really are active,

00:18:51.062 --> 00:18:54.517
who want to do something about it. Not that
they are not active, they want to do it.

00:18:54.542 --> 00:18:58.099
But they know only one way, is to act
through talking.

00:18:58.124 --> 00:19:01.467
They don't understand that there are inner ways

00:19:01.552 --> 00:19:05.773
by which you control it much more.

00:19:05.894 --> 00:19:10.437
Because they don't want to take to that,
they take to this talking.

00:19:10.694 --> 00:19:16.275
And once they take to talking and they talk
about it, the whole power flows away.

00:19:16.484 --> 00:19:20.629
But if they do not talk about it and keep
it within themselves.

00:19:20.972 --> 00:19:24.200
It’s alright, you can tell Me about your
experiences or anything,

00:19:24.225 --> 00:19:27.567
but if you start telling others, and
talking about it too much,

00:19:27.715 --> 00:19:32.253
then the powers that you have got will be
all disappearing gradually from you.

00:19:32.470 --> 00:19:36.632
And you will just come down to absolutely lowest level.

00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:40.043
So one should not too much talk that,
“I have this power,

00:19:40.068 --> 00:19:43.576
I have this power” or “I see this” or
“I do this,”

00:19:43.614 --> 00:19:48.081
which is a very wrong thing. I warn you,
don’t try to show off.

00:19:48.106 --> 00:19:50.742
Yes, you can talk about My powers.
It's all right.

00:19:50.927 --> 00:19:53.856
But don't try to talk about your powers.

00:19:54.058 --> 00:19:58.898
When it comes, of course, to talk
to somebody who is a negative person

00:19:59.017 --> 00:20:02.468
or to tell somebody, then you should say
that “we”, not “I”.

00:20:02.662 --> 00:20:08.722
“We” have, some of us have felt this power
within ourselves. We have seen people”.

00:20:08.763 --> 00:20:13.549
It may be you only, but you need not say,
'I' have. What you have to say is 'We'.

00:20:13.893 --> 00:20:19.946
Then you become the Mahat-Ahamkara. When
you say 'We', Yes, some of us', 'we do'.

00:20:20.187 --> 00:20:24.300
Like in Gregoire's book also I made it,
I saw to it,

00:20:24.325 --> 00:20:27.809
that he should not have many 'I's',
but he should have 'We'.

00:20:27.959 --> 00:20:31.864
'We think', 'we do', 'we'. Means, the whole
collective being,

00:20:31.889 --> 00:20:36.731
the whole collective organism, living
organism of Sahaja Yogis.

00:20:36.966 --> 00:20:39.411
So if you say, 'yes, some of us have got it',

00:20:39.436 --> 00:20:42.639
that means, you put yourself down,
but put all others above you.

00:20:42.751 --> 00:20:45.522
Say: 'Yes, some of us have. I know some
people have this.'

00:20:45.547 --> 00:20:50.305
That’'s the way one should do it. Because
if you have to overpower your ego,

00:20:50.330 --> 00:20:54.930
you must allow it to spread into everybody else.

00:20:55.014 --> 00:20:58.543
That’s how you will make it perfectly
all right, to make it spread.

00:20:58.568 --> 00:21:02.334
“We, all Sahaja Yogis, we all”.
But that pride is not there.

00:21:02.430 --> 00:21:05.900
I've seen that pride is not there.
Still it is very individualistic.

00:21:05.925 --> 00:21:10.207
If you start thinking, ''we Sahaja Yogis",
then what happens,

00:21:10.275 --> 00:21:13.507
that you become one personality,
one organization.

00:21:13.532 --> 00:21:16.919
But the person will look down upon
other people.

00:21:17.025 --> 00:21:22.393
He will see that this person is low, that
person is higher, that person is there.

00:21:22.587 --> 00:21:26.446
But he will not think, "'We' the Sahaja
Yogis, how beautiful we are.

00:21:26.646 --> 00:21:29.855
'We' the body of Sahaja Yoga, how beautiful we are."

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:37.041
So always think in the words of 'we',

00:21:37.274 --> 00:21:42.107
so your ego will become much less,
much less, much less.

00:21:42.132 --> 00:21:45.882
And the same ego, which looked so funny
and absurd,

00:21:46.052 --> 00:21:50.917
will form tomorrow the Ekadesha.

00:21:52.561 --> 00:21:57.558
Today’s individual ego will merge into Ekadesha.

00:21:57.759 --> 00:22:02.987
But we all must remember to say 'we' all time.

00:22:03.082 --> 00:22:07.904
This is what is today's day, is a great day
for us to change,

00:22:07.979 --> 00:22:11.885
because the Sun has changed its mood, now.
Sun is coming this side.

00:22:11.910 --> 00:22:17.842
So let us welcome the Sun, coming
to the North now, this way.

00:22:17.884 --> 00:22:22.198
And for Australians to say that though
the Sun has gone,

00:22:22.223 --> 00:22:27.262
let us establish the Sun, the domain
of Sun, within ourselves.

00:22:27.465 --> 00:22:30.190
Because Sun never disappears
from our inside.

00:22:30.279 --> 00:22:35.210
So that is how we have to take a mood
by which we should think

00:22:35.235 --> 00:22:39.197
of one personality, all of us together,
all of us together.

00:22:39.222 --> 00:22:45.091
And anybody who tries to be something
separate or different, he will drop out.

00:22:45.116 --> 00:22:48.218
I will drop him out. Whatever it may be,
it will drop out.

00:22:48.243 --> 00:22:52.482
So you just don’t worry: anybody who tries
to be singled out or anything.

00:22:52.507 --> 00:22:56.318
Everybody must do whatever they like,
to nurture the whole,

00:22:56.343 --> 00:22:59.625
to help the whole, to emancipate the whole.

00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:04.672
But not to, in anyway, put anyone down. Always.

00:23:04.883 --> 00:23:08.683
Because this is not the way the Sahaja Yoga is.

00:23:08.708 --> 00:23:11.249
Sahaja Yoga only works in collectivity.

00:23:11.274 --> 00:23:15.993
And the one who has developed
this permeating spirit,

00:23:16.234 --> 00:23:19.368
is a real Sahaja Yogi. Who has not, is not!

00:23:19.393 --> 00:23:22.800
Whatever you may think of yourself, I have
nothing to say.

00:23:22.825 --> 00:23:26.445
But this permeating personality, which
moves from places to places,

00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:29.290
whether you talk or not. Like your Mother is.

00:23:29.315 --> 00:23:32.397
Whether I meet you or not, makes
no difference, but I am permeating

00:23:32.422 --> 00:23:36.908
through all of you, by little, little
things, also, I am there with you.

00:23:37.081 --> 00:23:41.163
So like that, try to permeate into each
other and see the beauty.

00:23:41.188 --> 00:23:45.608
And you’ll enjoy yourself the best because
that is the biggest thing.

00:23:45.825 --> 00:23:48.749
That's the biggest thing that is
to be achieved.

00:23:48.774 --> 00:23:54.691
Because this ego you know makes you like a
nutshell and you just cannot have a rapport

00:23:54.716 --> 00:24:00.653
with that beauty of permeation and just see
how the notes move into each other.

00:24:00.678 --> 00:24:05.961
It will be a great idea today, it’s great
thing today we are having Puja in Dhulia.

00:24:06.674 --> 00:24:10.642
Like the Dhulia means the dust, dust.

00:24:10.668 --> 00:24:15.731
And one day I had written in childhood,
a poem, I remember.

00:24:15.756 --> 00:24:18.900
Very interesting poem it was - I don't know
whether it is lost -

00:24:18.925 --> 00:24:23.466
but which said that, "I want to be like
a dust particle

00:24:23.582 --> 00:24:27.402
which moves with the wind. It goes everywhere.

00:24:27.427 --> 00:24:33.326
Can go, sit on the head of a king, or can
go and fall at the feet of someone.

00:24:33.509 --> 00:24:39.689
And it can go and sit on a little flower,
and it can go and sit everywhere.

00:24:39.882 --> 00:24:44.511
But I want to be a particle of dust
that is fragrant,

00:24:44.688 --> 00:24:49.149
that is nourishing, that is enlightening."

00:24:49.422 --> 00:24:51.818
Like that, I had written a very beautiful poem,

00:24:51.843 --> 00:24:56.112
I must have been about seven years of age,
I remember - 'To be a dust particle',

00:24:56.217 --> 00:25:00.228
I remember that very clearly, long time back,

00:25:00.253 --> 00:25:06.589
that "I should be a dust particle so that
I’ll permeate into people."

00:25:06.815 --> 00:25:10.573
Which is a very big thing - to become
a dust particle of that kind.

00:25:10.598 --> 00:25:15.196
Whatever you touch, you see, that becomes enlivened,

00:25:15.389 --> 00:25:23.172
whatever you just feel, that has fragrance.
It’s such a great thing to be like that.

00:25:23.357 --> 00:25:27.601
And that was My desire, and it has been achieved.

00:25:27.711 --> 00:25:32.350
At that young age, I had this idea
of becoming a dust particle

00:25:32.417 --> 00:25:37.403
and today just while talking to you,
I remembered that I wanted to be that,

00:25:37.428 --> 00:25:41.248
and that is what this place is.
And Raulbai is like that.

00:25:41.447 --> 00:25:44.501
She’s a very simple woman, very simple woman,

00:25:44.623 --> 00:25:50.423
and she lives like a very simple person but
she has a sense of permeation.

00:25:50.607 --> 00:25:54.113
And now there are so many Sahaja Yogis,
yesterday who came.

00:25:54.138 --> 00:25:56.730
I am sure that they will take up Sahaja
Yoga very well.

00:25:56.755 --> 00:26:01.987
And there are lots of Sahaja Yogis from
Dhulia now,

00:26:02.012 --> 00:26:04.414
and I am sure there are going to be more people.

00:26:04.439 --> 00:26:07.722
I hope you have met all of them. Make
friends with all of them.

00:26:07.747 --> 00:26:10.820
Try to know them who they are. They may
not know English -

00:26:10.845 --> 00:26:14.846
so get somebody to translate. Talk to them
and be nice to them,

00:26:14.871 --> 00:26:18.550
be friendly with them. I wanted you to meet
them for permeation.

00:26:18.575 --> 00:26:21.664
You should know who are the people here,
who are in Nasik.

00:26:21.689 --> 00:26:24.842
Because somehow we never meet the Sahaja
Yogis, you see,

00:26:24.867 --> 00:26:27.670
who are in that particular place, and
when we go back

00:26:27.695 --> 00:26:30.284
we have only one or two addresses.
It is not a good idea.

00:26:30.309 --> 00:26:35.759
Try to see how many people there are.
Ask questions about them, and all that.

00:26:35.784 --> 00:26:41.090
This permeation is only possible when your
ego starts permeating all around,

00:26:41.249 --> 00:26:45.714
and this is the way to overcome
the problems of the right side

00:26:45.739 --> 00:26:48.125
and that is how to worship Saraswati.

00:26:48.157 --> 00:26:50.720
Because Saraswati has a veena in Her hand

00:26:50.745 --> 00:26:54.862
and that veena is the primordial
instrument, which She plays

00:26:54.887 --> 00:26:57.808
like music, and the music penetrates
into the heart.

00:26:57.833 --> 00:27:00.459
You don't know how it goes into you and how
it works out.

00:27:00.484 --> 00:27:05.600
And that’'s how a person who is a Sahaja Yogi

00:27:05.625 --> 00:27:08.434
should permeate like music into other people.

00:27:08.638 --> 00:27:13.415
She has so many qualities, as I told you,
which cannot be described in one lecture.

00:27:13.609 --> 00:27:21.512
But one of the greatest qualities of Hers
is that She ends up into subtler things.

00:27:21.689 --> 00:27:27.003
Like the Mother Earth will end up into fragrance.

00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:31.119
Music will end up into melodies,

00:27:31.144 --> 00:27:34.852
like that whatever She creates ends up
into something greater.

00:27:34.877 --> 00:27:38.905
Matter, whatever She produces, ends up
into aesthetics.

00:27:38.930 --> 00:27:42.343
If matter does not have aesthetics then it is gross.

00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:46.103
Like that everything. Now you will say,
"What is water?"

00:27:46.128 --> 00:27:51.735
Water becomes the river Ganges.
These are the subtler [things].

00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:55.994
So the matter gets into subtler thing
because it has to permeate,

00:27:56.019 --> 00:28:00.461
it has to permeate. So everything
whatever it is.

00:28:00.578 --> 00:28:07.286
And the best of all is the air -that air
becomes the vibrations.

00:28:10.328 --> 00:28:14.500
So you can see how, whatever has come out
from this matter,

00:28:14.525 --> 00:28:19.866
from these five elements, becomes that subtle thing.

00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:25.143
Of course, the left and right side both
work it out because the love

00:28:25.375 --> 00:28:31.934
has to work on this and when love acts
on matter it becomes that,

00:28:32.112 --> 00:28:35.510
and that is how one has to look at your own lives,

00:28:35.535 --> 00:28:42.330
to make it a beautiful combination of love and matter.

00:28:42.476 --> 00:28:45.403
May God bless you!

00:28:46.286 --> 00:28:49.114
(Marathi)
