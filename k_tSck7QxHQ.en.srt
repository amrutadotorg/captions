1
00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:15,645
But as Kundalini rises, on every center
you start getting the light of that center.

2
00:00:15,645 --> 00:00:20,645
At the first center you get back your innocence,

3
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:30,196
your eyes become innocent, your behavior becomes
innocent, you are not filled with lust and greed,

4
00:00:30,392 --> 00:00:38,220
you don’t look at things with lust and greed, but
you look at things with innocence, which is a very

5
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:45,600
big thing that people have lost and that you get
back and such a person develops many qualities.

6
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:54,480
One of them is that such a person is full of
fragrance, such a person has a tremendous gravity,

7
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:03,840
tremendous gravity, and such a
person has tremendous dynamism, and

8
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:09,500
attraction is a bad word so I don’t
want to use it, but magnetical.

9
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:18,485
His magnets is awakened within him, this
is the center of your magnet of the earth.

10
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:26,400
Such a person develops a tremendous
sense of roots and sense of direction,

11
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,460
you place him anywhere he will know where to go.

12
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:35,220
Like birds, you place birds anywhere they
know which side is north, south, east, west.

13
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:39,633
In the same way you also develop your lost

14
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:46,802
innocence and your magnet within you
by which you have proper direction;

15
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:55,203
but the highest of all you develop the proper
direction to wisdom which is the wise thing to do.

16
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:02,460
You just don't do stupid things, you just
don't do, even if you ever try to do it,

17
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:08,179
you will not do it, because you know
it is so stupid, just you don’t do it.

18
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:14,100
I mean it is so simple to
be wise than to be stupid,

19
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:18,987
because if you have to be stupid you
have to go out of the way to be stupid

20
00:02:18,987 --> 00:02:26,100
and idiotic; but if you want to be normal
and wise is the easiest thing to do.

21
00:02:26,191 --> 00:02:36,180
But what people do is to do things that would make
them more and more stupid, nonsensical, because

22
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:45,226
also some people told Me they do it, the reason
being they think they have a nuisance value.

23
00:02:45,226 --> 00:02:49,680
Like in London now we have one funny
stuff going on, they call it what?

24
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,400
"Punk rock."

25
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,380
You see, it’s a funny stuff.

26
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:58,800
Now poor things they don’t know what they
are doing it, and I think the only value

27
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:09,480
of that punk rock system is this: that
they try to sort of make a nuisance out

28
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:15,180
of them so that people feel attracted towards
them or sort of a significance out of them.

29
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:21,903
But when you become a realized soul you realize
your significance, because you understand

30
00:03:21,903 --> 00:03:31,200
you are part and parcel of the whole and that your
significance is to give Realization to others, the

31
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:38,100
highest of highest, that’s what you have to do now
you are a saint, and that’s how the whole attitude

32
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:48,065
of cheapiness, of outward shallowness finishes
and you become a serene, dignified personality.

33
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:54,060
This is not possible through any sermon,
any lecture, it’s only possible when the

34
00:03:54,060 --> 00:04:02,431
Kundalini rises you become like a very
dignified child, very dignified child.

35
00:04:02,431 --> 00:04:12,000
I’ve seen one beautiful painting done
of Mother Mary being taught first time.

36
00:04:12,074 --> 00:04:16,634
You see Her as a child, She is
a very dignified personality,

37
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:18,856
as a child, She is about ten years of age.

38
00:04:18,856 --> 00:04:25,038
I’ve seen My own grandchildren who are
not very old but extremely dignified.

39
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:28,380
They walk like kings, behave like kings.

40
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:33,720
In every behavior you find there’s such a
dignity, they’ll never do something shallow,

41
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:38,220
they never ask for anything, they never
weep for anything, they never cry for

42
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:43,500
anything, they are so dignified and they
understand it so well what is dignity is.

43
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:50,100
I don’t have to tell them, because they are born
realized, in the same way you become that, nobody

44
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:56,466
has to tell you that "do this, or do that," but
you understand that you must have self-respect.

45
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:01,980
This happens to you automatically,
this is actualization, nobody has to

46
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:04,020
tell you that "you be dignified," you just become.

47
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:09,452
I’ve seen people who were absolutely absurd,
even from this punk rock we got some people

48
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:13,740
and they were so changed that
people could not recognize them,

49
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:19,500
but one thing bad has happened with this
punk rock that they put some sort of dye

50
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:26,160
in their head and since then their eyes became
very weak, because these dyes I think made the

51
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:33,480
optic globe covered with some sort of a color and
you can’t see properly, and the eyes became very

52
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:39,600
weak and it took some time for us to remove
the effect of those dyes from their head.

53
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:46,080
We go headlong, "what’s wrong?" There is nothing
wrong in this world if it is a stupid fool,

54
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:52,260
but for a wise man there are very many things
which are absolutely wrong, and there are very

55
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:59,674
many things which are absolutely correct, so
you develop your wisdom by this first center.
