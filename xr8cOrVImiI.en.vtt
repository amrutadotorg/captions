00:00:29.041 --> 00:00:31.750
What is this need to go on My past?

00:00:32.291 --> 00:00:34.500
In the present.

00:00:37.291 --> 00:00:41.458
Om twamewa sakshat, Shri Nirmala Devyai namoh namaha.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
That's the biggest mantra, I tell you.

00:00:46.417 --> 00:00:49.709
That's the biggest mantra. Try it.

00:00:53.709 --> 00:00:55.417
Please repeat it again.

00:01:19.041 --> 00:01:23.166
Come along. Wash My feet. With the hands.

00:01:32.166 --> 00:01:37.709
Use both your hands.

00:01:42.208 --> 00:01:44.500
Two again.

00:01:45.834 --> 00:01:48.999
Faster. Wash it.

00:01:54.083 --> 00:01:56.417
Now, other three.

00:01:56.709 --> 00:01:59.667
Both the hands. Come along. Two of you.

00:02:10.542 --> 00:02:12.875
Good - done.

00:02:43.333 --> 00:02:46.208
Those who have not been, come along.

00:03:11.542 --> 00:03:14.667
Now the little children coming, in front.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.166
Come from this side, come along.

00:03:33.625 --> 00:03:36.250
Use the other hand.

00:03:49.333 --> 00:03:52.291
All right - done.

00:04:58.667 --> 00:05:00.709
With both the hands.

00:05:01.083 --> 00:05:03.625
Now say English mantras.

00:05:14.083 --> 00:05:18.208
All right. The another group. Come along, one by one.

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.542
In English.

00:05:25.417 --> 00:05:29.500
Both the hands, good - done.

00:05:41.999 --> 00:05:44.750
Nice. Very nice.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.999
Please use both the hands.

00:06:51.834 --> 00:06:55.583
Rub it with both the hands. That's good. All right.

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:58.250
Now, who's next? Is there more?

00:07:02.834 --> 00:07:06.875
Go and sit behind them, one after another.

00:07:23.917 --> 00:07:26.709
Hard. Rub it hard.

00:07:32.917 --> 00:07:35.709
All right, done.

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:50.999
Come close.

00:07:51.625 --> 00:07:55.250
That's the boy. You wash My feet.

00:07:57.333 --> 00:08:01.041
Good. With the other hand also.

00:08:06.208 --> 00:08:10.750
May God bless you. Lots of confidence!

00:08:11.959 --> 00:08:15.291
May God bless you. Good.

00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:30.125
Take it in, what he's saying, take it in.

00:09:35.375 --> 00:09:39.083
You all are saying it.

00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:27.542
Now, you could have seen that, Ganesha is the key.

00:13:27.875 --> 00:13:31.917
Christ is the key of all the things.

00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:34.999
He's the key, He's the essence of all the things, you see,

00:13:35.291 --> 00:13:37.583
and so through Him everything works out.

00:13:37.959 --> 00:13:39.750
See, even if you have to come to Me,

00:13:40.041 --> 00:13:42.166
you have to come through Him.

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:46.166
That means in you that innocence must be born,

00:13:46.542 --> 00:13:47.834
then you come to Me.

00:13:48.125 --> 00:13:49.625
So Ganesha is so important.

00:13:49.959 --> 00:13:52.875
And Australia is the centre of Ganesha.

00:13:53.166 --> 00:13:57.041
So you people are so important, you are the key.

00:13:57.917 --> 00:13:59.625
So it is more necessary

00:13:59.959 --> 00:14:02.041
that you should be much more on the essences

00:14:02.375 --> 00:14:04.125
than anybody else.

00:14:04.458 --> 00:14:06.166
In every way - as I told you,

00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:08.709
that man has to be a man, woman has to be a woman.

00:14:09.041 --> 00:14:11.041
These are all the essences, that's the essence.

00:14:11.458 --> 00:14:13.709
That's very important. On you rests;

00:14:14.041 --> 00:14:17.792
because through you it's going to work out,

00:14:18.083 --> 00:14:19.458
through your innocence.

00:14:19.792 --> 00:14:21.208
You are the ones who make the innocence

00:14:21.542 --> 00:14:26.375
of the Western people - it's very important.

00:15:21.792 --> 00:15:26.125
Better give it to Warren for the time being.

00:15:46.667 --> 00:15:49.875
Also you must notice that every year,

00:15:50.208 --> 00:15:51.625
everything is shortening.

00:15:51.959 --> 00:15:53.667
You see, even giving realization is shortening,

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.208
puja is shortening.

00:15:55.625 --> 00:15:57.625
We have to save time, isn't it?

00:15:57.959 --> 00:16:01.625
So shortening is there. But why? Because there's powers.

00:16:12.333 --> 00:16:14.542
There is sustenance, and you can sustain that power,

00:16:14.834 --> 00:16:17.333
because you are there, so many channels;

00:16:17.709 --> 00:16:20.583
so you can shorten it.

00:16:22.041 --> 00:16:25.917
I hope this doesn't fall off!

00:16:27.375 --> 00:16:30.291
Are you saying - he's saying yes.

00:16:30.750 --> 00:16:32.500
All right. Now, what do we do -

00:16:32.834 --> 00:16:40.625
just to have the washing of the hands, let's do that.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.999
But you don't have to, you can put just one ....

00:18:33.083 --> 00:18:38.208
Can somebody else do this? Come here. Pour this on.

00:18:39.041 --> 00:18:43.834
You come the other side. You come here to do it.

00:29:45.625 --> 00:29:47.999
Today, as it is the Birthday

00:29:48.333 --> 00:29:53.375
in the island of Shri Ganesh,

00:29:54.999 --> 00:29:57.250
I think all the Puja should be done by children,

00:29:57.542 --> 00:29:59.291
it would be better.

00:29:59.667 --> 00:30:01.917
All right, so the girls have to get up now.

00:30:02.250 --> 00:30:05.500
Hold the sari - let them have the sari.

00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:12.208
Have you got bigger girls, unmarried?

00:30:14.333 --> 00:30:17.291
Just give them the sari to hold - the girls.

00:30:23.542 --> 00:30:25.458
I don't know if the children can hold it or not,

00:30:25.792 --> 00:30:27.792
it's so heavy.

00:30:28.834 --> 00:30:32.000
Have it double, like that.

00:30:32.458 --> 00:30:37.125
So - now, you all stand up at an end, all right?

00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:40.333
And hold the sari from this side,

00:30:40.959 --> 00:30:44.083
and you go that side and hold it, high.

00:30:46.667 --> 00:30:50.041
Now, all the children first. Little that side.

00:30:50.417 --> 00:30:54.792
All right. Now - you come forward.

00:30:55.125 --> 00:30:56.917
Let the girls show the sari round. Right;

00:30:57.208 --> 00:30:58.542
you come forward this way.

00:30:58.875 --> 00:31:00.709
All right. Now, you hold the sari. Go that way.

00:31:00.999 --> 00:31:02.709
Now you, all the girls come here.

00:31:03.583 --> 00:31:06.458
Now, you hold it on this side, hold higher.

00:31:06.750 --> 00:31:10.709
Let everyone see the sari.

00:31:11.667 --> 00:31:15.000
Some big girls should also help them.

00:31:35.875 --> 00:31:38.250
Let them hold it at their height.

00:31:38.375 --> 00:31:40.000
Now, you come along, bigger girls,

00:31:43.999 --> 00:31:48.208
You two or four of you, come along - the bigger ones.

00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:53.041
Come here. Let them hold it a little that side.

00:31:53.417 --> 00:31:57.208
All right, just move it in, in the children.

00:32:02.625 --> 00:32:05.667
Now, what you do is to put here,

00:32:06.041 --> 00:32:10.041
the red mark. Is the red mark, from there?

00:32:12.999 --> 00:32:16.417
First make the line, all right?

00:32:20.875 --> 00:32:22.709
I think the big girls should hold it now,

00:32:22.959 --> 00:32:25.166
and we'll call them for putting the flowers, all right?

00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:28.250
Just the big girls should do it. All right.

00:32:28.667 --> 00:32:30.959
All the little ones now should sit down.

00:32:31.333 --> 00:32:34.750
We'll call you for the flowers, all right?

00:32:40.125 --> 00:32:42.875
Now, you have to put the line here ...

00:32:48.999 --> 00:32:50.166
and then beyond the line.

00:32:50.417 --> 00:32:54.583
Here also one line, and then beyond the line.

00:32:57.417 --> 00:33:00.542
This thing has to be inside the line.

00:33:01.250 --> 00:33:04.166
Put the line.

00:34:47.834 --> 00:34:51.208
Put this under the foot.

00:35:18.709 --> 00:35:24.208
You have to complete the red fully, there.

00:35:44.250 --> 00:35:48.125
Now you have to make a swastika.

00:35:57.999 --> 00:36:00.625
On top.

00:36:16.709 --> 00:36:21.792
Now put one also this side. It's all right.

00:36:25.166 --> 00:36:30.291
Exactly seven you are! Did you notice that?

00:36:37.375 --> 00:36:40.625
Yes, now remove this from here,

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:45.542
and you have to put these individual...from here.

00:36:46.291 --> 00:36:48.667
Have to put it little bit.

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:53.333
Make a swastika on the red,

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.750
in the center.

00:37:11.125 --> 00:37:16.792
I'll help you put it.

00:37:19.917 --> 00:37:23.500
On top of that one.

00:37:27.250 --> 00:37:30.000
Good. All right, done.

00:37:30.542 --> 00:37:34.625
Now, you bring the sari around - now.

00:37:38.875 --> 00:37:42.375
Now, decorate with flowers.

00:37:42.625 --> 00:37:43.875
The children can come.

00:37:44.125 --> 00:37:46.917
Now, bring the sari around, like that.

00:37:53.458 --> 00:37:58.792
Let the children come, to do the flowers

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.667
Now, get the boys here for the flowers.

00:38:41.250 --> 00:38:44.375
And other flowers also we got.

00:38:49.250 --> 00:38:52.542
Let the boys do that.

00:38:53.917 --> 00:38:59.583
Make it straight, put it down

00:39:15.625 --> 00:39:18.709
so that the flowers are on top.

00:39:25.333 --> 00:39:30.166
Let the boys do the flowers and ask them to arrange them.

00:40:38.125 --> 00:40:41.458
The bigger girls can come to do it, the girls.

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:44.999
Not the ones who have done My Feet now,

00:40:45.250 --> 00:40:46.959
because the ones who have done My feet you have seen.

00:40:47.250 --> 00:40:49.041
The ones who have done My Feet now,

00:40:49.417 --> 00:40:52.583
the other ones, come along.

00:41:08.458 --> 00:41:10.417
Give one to her.

00:41:12.250 --> 00:41:16.041
There, too - take one.

00:41:21.667 --> 00:41:25.166
And all these rings...

00:41:33.750 --> 00:41:38.125
First left, that's it .

00:41:49.999 --> 00:41:53.834
So thank you very much!

00:42:16.333 --> 00:42:18.959
Get some more girls there now.

00:42:19.250 --> 00:42:22.999
Any other girls? Come and help.

00:43:28.375 --> 00:43:30.667
Can you do this, you see, one side.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:35.667
You do it equally ... the same thing the other side.

00:43:36.375 --> 00:43:39.458
Now, this one you have to put the other way round, you see.

00:43:39.875 --> 00:43:43.834
One is this side, and one is for that side.

00:46:22.750 --> 00:46:26.125
So beautiful it is.

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:57.542
Shri Mataji,from all the children of Australia

00:47:57.917 --> 00:48:00.667
for Your birthday.

00:48:12.999 --> 00:48:15.041
Thank you very much.

00:48:15.375 --> 00:48:17.000
It's too much!

00:48:17.333 --> 00:48:20.875
He says I have to have it now, I don't know what.

00:48:22.208 --> 00:48:26.709
Do you know, it matches with My sari.

00:50:02.999 --> 00:50:06.875
It's a collar of love!

00:50:12.667 --> 00:50:16.959
Now, that's how it should be.

00:50:17.083 --> 00:50:18.542
With this collar, Shri Mataji,

00:50:18.750 --> 00:50:23.375
we expect that the left Vishuddhi be cleared everywhere!

00:50:37.041 --> 00:50:39.041
Also with this collar, Shri Mataji,

00:50:39.291 --> 00:50:42.208
we chose that because the chakra of the pearls

00:50:42.417 --> 00:50:44.041
also is cleared!

00:50:44.375 --> 00:50:48.166
Very good idea!

00:51:02.083 --> 00:51:08.834
There's another ring - smaller ring - all right.

00:52:07.583 --> 00:52:11.166
That looks so nice!

00:52:29.709 --> 00:52:31.792
Bit high.

00:52:40.999 --> 00:52:44.041
One is all right.

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:12.083
Let Me have the comb, please.

00:53:33.750 --> 00:53:38.208
Now I am sixty-three years of age.

00:53:54.875 --> 00:53:59.583
No, sixty-fourth year, can you imagine?

00:54:02.125 --> 00:54:05.208
We will have this special...

00:54:13.583 --> 00:54:17.709
Now, those who want to take photographs can come.

00:55:17.667 --> 00:55:18.792
This is for You, Mother.

00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:21.750
Is it?

00:55:40.500 --> 00:55:42.875
I know you have to look after such tremendous things,

00:55:43.083 --> 00:55:45.875
but I don't know where our photographer has gone.

00:55:46.208 --> 00:55:50.208
I think he is not here ... Matthew's not here.

00:55:51.291 --> 00:55:55.000
Let's see how it goes.

00:55:57.041 --> 00:56:02.250
Take a full one. Take a nice one or two.

00:57:01.875 --> 00:57:05.750
Now it's done. All right.

00:57:36.709 --> 00:57:40.875
You'd like to take it without garlands, I think it's better

00:57:44.542 --> 00:57:47.583
Look at this one.

00:57:48.041 --> 00:57:50.542
These are so beautiful.

00:57:50.875 --> 00:57:52.750
It's the real Radha style, you see.

00:57:53.041 --> 00:57:56.500
Most are the back side.

00:58:06.667 --> 00:58:11.000
Look at this one here - beautiful!

00:58:29.625 --> 00:58:33.750
Come along. So, from where did you get all these?

00:58:36.083 --> 00:58:39.000
Is there somebody to help?

00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:05.875
It's beautiful. The best style we've had.

00:59:06.250 --> 00:59:08.917
This is the design we should have also.

00:59:09.333 --> 00:59:11.125
We should take it to England, India,

00:59:11.500 --> 00:59:14.999
we'll work it out which is the best.

00:59:15.625 --> 00:59:21.291
These are the three Goddesses...So many ornaments!

01:00:38.250 --> 01:00:41.667
Now. I'd better see what ....

01:00:41.999 --> 01:00:44.291
It's so nice and comfortable.

01:00:44.709 --> 01:00:46.458
It could be like that, you see,

01:00:46.542 --> 01:00:49.792
because this must have been Mooladhara ...

01:00:50.041 --> 01:00:51.542
That was the thing:

01:00:51.834 --> 01:00:55.792
there's no way of covering the Mooladhara.

01:01:11.500 --> 01:01:15.083
So must be like that. See?

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:07.500
Now, let Me have the sari on.

01:02:08.250 --> 01:02:12.125
Put the sari on, the girls - come along.

01:02:53.291 --> 01:02:57.250
Take a full one, if you like.

01:03:19.917 --> 01:03:21.375
They've taken the feet, all right.

01:03:21.709 --> 01:03:23.750
Now, that's all the photographs?

01:03:24.083 --> 01:03:27.333
Now, lots to do. You have to get the garland.

01:03:27.834 --> 01:03:30.542
So first of all give Me those things that are there.

01:03:30.875 --> 01:03:33.750
I'll just touch them. All right?

01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:05.000
More girls, bigger girls.

01:07:12.041 --> 01:07:15.375
Three saris in one.

01:07:40.959 --> 01:07:42.999
All the seven girls come.

01:07:43.333 --> 01:07:45.250
Those who were holding My sari.

01:07:56.417 --> 01:08:00.500
All right? May God bless you.

01:08:02.917 --> 01:08:06.417
Now done. Now flowers.

01:08:11.750 --> 01:08:14.834
The girls can do it.

01:08:17.999 --> 01:08:21.583
Now the garlands.

01:08:56.083 --> 01:09:02.417
This is typically, this is made in South India,

01:09:02.750 --> 01:09:04.250
they make a huge big thing.

01:09:04.500 --> 01:09:05.709
And also in India they did it.

01:09:05.999 --> 01:09:07.667
And they called as ...

01:09:07.959 --> 01:09:11.083
Thank you very much!

01:09:56.041 --> 01:10:01.917
Take a full one, with the feet in.

01:10:51.792 --> 01:10:54.083
Thank you very much, thank you.

01:10:56.750 --> 01:11:00.500
With the aarti we'd like to keep the garland.

01:13:04.834 --> 01:13:08.375
Also the big brass things can be brought in.

01:13:09.625 --> 01:13:11.999
One this side, one that side.

01:13:12.166 --> 01:13:13.333
These things can move out,

01:13:13.625 --> 01:13:17.834
so that you can take a full photograph.

01:32:43.208 --> 01:32:48.166
All right. Now I'll come down here.
