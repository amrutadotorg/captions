1
00:00:04,519 --> 00:00:07,019
 Like fumes.

2
00:00:08,419 --> 00:00:10,919
Fumo.

3
00:00:10,919 --> 00:00:14,191
And it is such an absurd place.

4
00:00:14,192 --> 00:00:17,532
And there is, also very surprising that,

5
00:00:17,544 --> 00:00:20,832
every 28 minutes, in a place

6
00:00:20,832 --> 00:00:22,812
water comes out of the Mother Earth,

7
00:00:22,812 --> 00:00:25,312
every 28 minutes.

8
00:00:25,318 --> 00:00:28,455
It shoots off, exactly after 28 minutes.

9
00:00:28,469 --> 00:00:31,305
It’s a very funny place and lot of sulphur,

10
00:00:31,339 --> 00:00:32,875
lot of sulphur there.

11
00:00:32,905 --> 00:00:35,965
Sulphur just bubbling out of,

12
00:00:35,975 --> 00:00:39,345
you find suddenly from somewhere
there’s a hot water coming out

13
00:00:39,345 --> 00:00:41,723
like just pouring out water.

14
00:00:41,735 --> 00:00:43,883
 Can you imagine such a place?

15
00:00:43,883 --> 00:00:46,103
Now, Andes is another site.

16
00:00:46,143 --> 00:00:52,976
Andes is a kind that will give tremors, earthquakes.

17
00:00:53,006 --> 00:00:54,646
It will give lots of earthquakes

18
00:00:54,646 --> 00:00:57,926
and it has lots of gold also because it’s a right-sided,

19
00:00:57,986 --> 00:01:01,556
lot of gold and it will be giving lots of earthquakes.

20
00:01:01,556 --> 00:01:04,786
When it will come to destruction,

21
00:01:04,796 --> 00:01:07,146
it will be used as earthquakes.

22
00:01:07,166 --> 00:01:09,496
They will, it will act as earthquakes.

23
00:01:09,505 --> 00:01:11,808
America is that whole portion,

24
00:01:11,825 --> 00:01:14,325
 it is all Andes from top to bottom,

25
00:01:14,325 --> 00:01:17,418
 and all that will be shattered by earthquakes.

26
00:01:17,418 --> 00:01:23,120
So, these two forces will act
more at the time of destruction.

27
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:26,250
So, one has to be careful about it.

28
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:31,340
Because, you see, Bolivia,
say Peru and all these places,

29
00:01:31,362 --> 00:01:33,862
these people went from here.

30
00:01:33,862 --> 00:01:36,899
They killed so many of these people.

31
00:01:36,922 --> 00:01:40,989
So many of these races were killed completely.

32
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:43,149
Then dead bodies were there.

33
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:45,909
Killing is very bad, because when you kill a person,

34
00:01:45,929 --> 00:01:53,029
that person cannot take birth and
hangs in the air and becomes a bhoot.

35
00:01:53,054 --> 00:01:55,029
So, they have overpowered Americans.

36
00:01:55,029 --> 00:01:56,649
 That’s why Americans are like that.

37
00:01:56,661 --> 00:02:01,589
 You see, they killed all the people
from New York to the whole of America

38
00:02:01,585 --> 00:02:04,289
was all people who were aboriginal.

39
00:02:04,289 --> 00:02:06,469
So, they have possessed them also.

40
00:02:06,469 --> 00:02:08,469
And in the same way in the South it’s happening.

41
00:02:08,463 --> 00:02:10,009
So, it is all, again,

42
00:02:10,017 --> 00:02:12,749
 though it is right-sided but it’s supraconscious,

43
00:02:12,752 --> 00:02:15,252
all supraconscious things.

44
00:02:15,252 --> 00:02:17,349
So, they have to be very careful now.

45
00:02:17,349 --> 00:02:19,019
They have to take to Sahaja Yoga

46
00:02:19,019 --> 00:02:21,519
and those who will be taking to
Sahaja Yoga will be only saved.

47
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:24,019
The rest will be destroyed,

48
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:28,739
because Andes will act as a
supraconscious thing for destruction.

49
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:31,239
And Fujiyama and all that, will have,

50
00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:34,623
not, they will have those, what you call them?

51
00:02:34,623 --> 00:02:37,123
Volcanoes.

52
00:02:37,123 --> 00:02:39,223
Mother, I‘m terribly sorry, but

53
00:02:39,247 --> 00:02:41,747
the tape, we ran out of tape.

54
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,943
Would You just explain again the left side,

55
00:02:43,943 --> 00:02:45,653
the right side and the Himalayas?

56
00:02:45,656 --> 00:02:47,533
I’m sorry to do this to You.

57
00:02:47,533 --> 00:02:48,133
Of what?

58
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:51,801
Just as You described just a moment ago,

59
00:02:51,811 --> 00:02:55,921
how the Himalayas is this and the two columns.

60
00:02:55,916 --> 00:03:00,980
You see, you think of Himalaya as the central point,

61
00:03:00,995 --> 00:03:01,620
Kailash

62
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:05,475
Yes. Sahasrara.

63
00:03:05,496 --> 00:03:07,665
Yes, fontanelle bone

64
00:03:07,665 --> 00:03:12,625
And this is the plate of the Ekadesha.

65
00:03:12,627 --> 00:03:13,875
All right!

66
00:03:13,908 --> 00:03:22,578
Now all the, even this Zermatt and this alps
 and all that is in the same.

67
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:24,034
In the same line?

68
00:03:24,043 --> 00:03:26,103
On the right and left side, both sides.

69
00:03:26,103 --> 00:03:28,603
(Unclear) Argentina we have all these on that

70
00:03:28,603 --> 00:03:31,103
so it’s all Ekadesha

71
00:03:31,103 --> 00:03:35,853
 But, on both the sides, we have got Andes

72
00:03:35,858 --> 00:03:40,051
and this side, we have got Fujiyama and all this.

73
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:50,507
Out of these two, the left-sided one is the Andes.

74
00:03:50,507 --> 00:03:54,134
I‘ve treated it as Andes as left-sided actually,

75
00:03:54,153 --> 00:03:58,127
because the sun rises from this side,

76
00:03:58,153 --> 00:04:00,653
and the right-sided one should be

77
00:04:00,653 --> 00:04:03,747
the Japanese according to Sahaja Yoga style.

78
00:04:03,747 --> 00:04:06,247
But in the thing, if you see,

79
00:04:06,247 --> 00:04:09,876
this is right and this is left.

80
00:04:09,877 --> 00:04:13,816
Now, what has happened is that

81
00:04:13,827 --> 00:04:22,008
the right-sided people like Spanish and all that,

82
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:23,660
went down there

83
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:26,460
 and killed so many of these people,

84
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:29,926
 who were all right-sided too.

85
00:04:29,935 --> 00:04:32,435
So the whole thing we should call it as right-sided

86
00:04:32,435 --> 00:04:34,935
now. The Andes as right-sided.

87
00:04:34,935 --> 00:04:36,506
Because right-sided people

88
00:04:36,506 --> 00:04:39,006
 will be punished by the right-sided defects

89
00:04:39,006 --> 00:04:42,016
and left will be punished by the left-sided defects.

90
00:04:42,006 --> 00:04:44,506
So, because the right-sided people have gone there

91
00:04:44,506 --> 00:04:47,486
and have killed the right-sided people,

92
00:04:47,486 --> 00:04:49,076
the right-sided people there

93
00:04:49,076 --> 00:04:50,976
have overpowered these people.

94
00:04:50,976 --> 00:04:52,886
That’s why the speed is there,

95
00:04:52,886 --> 00:04:55,386
and the Americans are, you see, like this

96
00:04:55,386 --> 00:04:59,366
all very violent all these things, because of that.

97
00:04:59,357 --> 00:05:03,146
Now all these things put together forms this,

98
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:05,236
the Andes, you see, is there, standing,

99
00:05:05,215 --> 00:05:07,715
waiting for its chance.

100
00:05:07,715 --> 00:05:10,955
And when the things will be horrible absolutely,

101
00:05:10,987 --> 00:05:14,127
there won’t be any atomic bomb blast or anything.

102
00:05:14,157 --> 00:05:18,846
These, themselves will have earthquakes.

103
00:05:18,846 --> 00:05:23,717
Now, earthquake is the quality of Mother Earth.

104
00:05:23,717 --> 00:05:26,217
And she will assert through these.

105
00:05:26,217 --> 00:05:30,369
And on the right-hand side…

106
00:05:30,387 --> 00:05:32,887
Actually, it is actually not on the right-hand side,

107
00:05:32,887 --> 00:05:35,387
but now it’s the left-hand side

108
00:05:35,387 --> 00:05:39,818
of these Japanese what will happen…

109
00:05:39,819 --> 00:05:42,788
Because they were made into left-hand sided,

110
00:05:42,788 --> 00:05:45,137
because they were given these drugs,

111
00:05:45,138 --> 00:05:47,097
opium, this thing, that thing.

112
00:05:47,107 --> 00:05:49,017
So they became left-sided.

113
00:05:49,017 --> 00:05:54,317
Now, these left-handed people
will be finished with volcanoes

114
00:05:54,356 --> 00:05:56,687
There will be volcanoes. There will be typhoons,

115
00:05:56,696 --> 00:05:57,923
they’ll be finished.

116
00:05:57,926 --> 00:06:00,426
While on this side, the

117
00:06:00,426 --> 00:06:03,443
people who have been following

118
00:06:03,466 --> 00:06:07,663
these all wrong things will be finished with earthquakes.

119
00:06:07,673 --> 00:06:10,173
And all these places like,

120
00:06:10,173 --> 00:06:13,345
you can say, the west coast...

121
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:18,805
The west coast of America is very dangerous,

122
00:06:18,803 --> 00:06:24,505
because there were so many
atrocities done by Americans.

123
00:06:24,505 --> 00:06:27,005
They cannot get away with it,

124
00:06:27,005 --> 00:06:30,188
so themselves they’ll be finished
because they’ll become lunatics,

125
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:36,438
mad and apart from that, the Mother Earth
itself will finish them, partly.

126
00:06:38,068 --> 00:06:41,801
Now on the right-hand side,

127
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:45,811
I think volcanoes will be finished this way,

128
00:06:45,811 --> 00:06:48,311
at the destruction time they’ll be used….

129
00:06:48,311 --> 00:06:51,471
 But just now as far as now is concerned

130
00:06:51,503 --> 00:06:55,491
we have to see how many people we can bring out.

131
00:06:55,513 --> 00:06:59,851
If the number of Sahaja yogis
increases in those areas,

132
00:06:59,874 --> 00:07:03,811
then maybe, that Mother will be pacified.

133
00:07:06,599 --> 00:07:09,099
The same that was written in the Bible,

134
00:07:09,646 --> 00:07:12,146
The same is written in the Bible,

135
00:07:12,146 --> 00:07:19,556
when God wants to come and
kill the Sodom and Gomorrah

136
00:07:19,543 --> 00:07:23,056
and Abraham perhaps asked to God,

137
00:07:23,066 --> 00:07:25,296
“but God if there is ten good people,

138
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:27,116
what will you do?”

139
00:07:27,116 --> 00:07:29,616
and God said “O.K., I will save them,”

140
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:33,824
and then Abraham say, “but if there
are nine people, good people?”

141
00:07:33,856 --> 00:07:36,124
and God say, “O.K. I will save them.”

142
00:07:36,146 --> 00:07:39,626
so he asked, "And if there's just one good people?"

143
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:43,025
Then God said: “O.K., I will save that town.”

144
00:07:43,025 --> 00:07:45,145
And now Mother, are we the same?

145
00:07:45,155 --> 00:07:47,655
Now we are thousands.

146
00:07:47,655 --> 00:07:50,155
But in the Bible, it is written only how many?

147
00:07:50,155 --> 00:07:53,528
Hundred and forty-four thousand.

148
00:07:53,535 --> 00:07:58,608
That's all?

149
00:08:01,545 --> 00:08:04,845
We’re about reaching that number,

150
00:08:04,857 --> 00:08:07,357
one hundred and forty-four thousand.

151
00:08:10,467 --> 00:08:12,967
Only!

152
00:08:15,407 --> 00:08:16,797
It's written.

153
00:08:16,807 --> 00:08:18,547
It is written in the Bible.

154
00:08:18,547 --> 00:08:22,137
Shri Mataji, does it mean that the Last Judgement

155
00:08:22,149 --> 00:08:27,127
at the time of destruction will manifest in these forms,

156
00:08:27,155 --> 00:08:28,884
earthquake and volcanoes?

157
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:31,024
Of course, that will be there.

158
00:08:31,038 --> 00:08:33,144
So many things will happen

159
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:35,313
and people will be killed and destroyed.

160
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,820
And then they'll be put to the last thing,

161
00:08:37,842 --> 00:08:39,343
they will go to hell.

162
00:08:39,392 --> 00:08:41,892
People will descend to the hell.

163
00:08:41,892 --> 00:08:44,392
You see, what will happen on this Earth only,

164
00:08:44,392 --> 00:08:46,242
people will become mad,

165
00:08:46,261 --> 00:08:51,342
they’ll start eating faeces, Naraka
they will be creating for themselves.

166
00:08:51,342 --> 00:08:57,042
Now only the way, say, they are following Rajneesh.

167
00:08:57,042 --> 00:08:58,962
What are they doing?

168
00:08:58,962 --> 00:09:01,462
It's Naraka.

169
00:09:01,462 --> 00:09:03,761
That’s how they’ll be punished.

170
00:09:03,762 --> 00:09:06,262
 And those who are described now, one thousand...

171
00:09:06,262 --> 00:09:09,551
one hundred and forty-four
thousand is a very small number.

172
00:09:12,871 --> 00:09:17,980
Can I ask a question about those people
who get killed, Mother and become bhoots?

173
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:21,380
Is there never any chance?

174
00:09:21,404 --> 00:09:23,270
Difficult.

175
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,710
Those who are killed might be,

176
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:28,320
but those who are possessed...

177
00:09:28,361 --> 00:09:33,410
You see, what has happened that those
who are killed are reborn again.

178
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:36,410
And some, those who are...

179
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:39,431
have been killing are also reborn.

180
00:09:39,455 --> 00:09:42,915
So there is a chance for such people.

181
00:09:42,945 --> 00:09:46,475
But those who are killed are possessing people

182
00:09:46,473 --> 00:09:48,973
who killed them.

183
00:09:53,953 --> 00:09:56,003
Why did they kill?

184
00:09:56,003 --> 00:09:57,939
They had no business.

185
00:09:57,993 --> 00:10:01,409
“Thou shalt not kill.”

186
00:10:01,423 --> 00:10:03,923
 I mean after all, if you do not

187
00:10:03,923 --> 00:10:09,440
follow one rule and regulation
of your hopeless government,

188
00:10:09,426 --> 00:10:11,926
you are punished. What about God?

189
00:10:11,926 --> 00:10:16,350
He said “thou shalt not kill” and you have killed.

190
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:18,882
 So, you should not be punished?

191
00:10:18,882 --> 00:10:21,382
I was thinking of those that got killed,

192
00:10:21,382 --> 00:10:25,076
those who were killed, the victims.

193
00:10:25,087 --> 00:10:28,076
If they are reborn they will not,

194
00:10:28,076 --> 00:10:33,663
but if they are taking a revenge, then how to save?

195
00:10:33,683 --> 00:10:36,853
And they can choose?

196
00:10:36,883 --> 00:10:39,863
They can choose.

197
00:10:39,873 --> 00:10:43,573
If they want, they should take
their birth, get realisation.

198
00:10:43,573 --> 00:10:48,304
But they are trying to become bhoots.

199
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:57,267
The idea of revenge should not be there.

200
00:10:57,284 --> 00:11:01,254
Now, you see, Indians have only this sense, actually.

201
00:11:01,254 --> 00:11:04,404
How much Britishers have tortured Indians,

202
00:11:04,428 --> 00:11:07,384
you have no idea.

203
00:11:07,418 --> 00:11:10,078
 I mean, I cannot tell you how much they have done.

204
00:11:10,108 --> 00:11:13,188
I can only tell you about my own family,

205
00:11:13,198 --> 00:11:18,238
that my father’s all houses,
everything was taken away.

206
00:11:18,238 --> 00:11:22,548
We were living in palaces, we started living in huts.

207
00:11:22,549 --> 00:11:24,858
Cars, everything, all ornaments,

208
00:11:24,855 --> 00:11:27,865
everything of my mother was taken away.

209
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:29,525
Only we had one big...

210
00:11:29,535 --> 00:11:34,195
mother had a big family gold thing we called Vaijayanti mala,

211
00:11:34,225 --> 00:11:36,105
that’s the only thing that she had hidden,

212
00:11:36,149 --> 00:11:39,495
which she pawned and on that she educated us.

213
00:11:39,462 --> 00:11:41,305
To me, they have beaten,

214
00:11:41,315 --> 00:11:43,555
they have given me electric shocks.

215
00:11:43,565 --> 00:11:48,915
They put me on the ice slabs.

216
00:11:48,938 --> 00:11:52,465
I was a young girl of 18-19 years, you see.

217
00:11:52,474 --> 00:11:54,734
To so many people they have tortured like this.

218
00:11:54,730 --> 00:12:00,904
Oh, they have tortured and tortured
to such an extent, you have no idea.

219
00:12:00,904 --> 00:12:06,477
But... and raping, prostitution,
everything they did to Indians.

220
00:12:06,504 --> 00:12:08,447
But Indians don’t hate English.

221
00:12:08,484 --> 00:12:10,984
They don’t hate them.

222
00:12:10,984 --> 00:12:14,174
They are very kind. If English go there, you see

223
00:12:14,176 --> 00:12:19,924
some English barristers went in to India and
the holiday was given to the High Court.

224
00:12:21,836 --> 00:12:24,336
They are so respectful, but when English now,

225
00:12:24,356 --> 00:12:26,856
when the Indians, because they misbehaved

226
00:12:26,836 --> 00:12:29,271
 and they brought so many Indians with them.

227
00:12:29,292 --> 00:12:31,481
Now they were given British passports

228
00:12:31,502 --> 00:12:35,771
and sent as slaves to East Africa to work there.

229
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:41,751
But when East Africa became independent they had British passports, so they came as Britishers.

230
00:12:41,772 --> 00:12:44,272
Now they are treated as immigrants in England.

231
00:12:44,272 --> 00:12:46,341
 Think of it.

232
00:12:46,362 --> 00:12:50,446
Actually, they have only British
passport, they have no other passport.

233
00:12:50,446 --> 00:12:53,666
And 80% of Indians are like that.

234
00:12:53,671 --> 00:12:58,799
10% are students and 10% may be Pakistanis.

235
00:12:58,789 --> 00:13:00,159
Can you imagine?

236
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:02,659
And see the condition of Indians in England,

237
00:13:02,659 --> 00:13:05,159
the way these English feel about them.

238
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:10,969
So, naturally, one would feel very
embittered with them. Isn’t it?

239
00:13:10,969 --> 00:13:14,879
 But I have never seen any Indian
criticising English people.

240
00:13:14,902 --> 00:13:18,262
My husband once said it is Indians who are responsible,

241
00:13:18,272 --> 00:13:22,662
they behave in such a manner, they wash
their clothes, they hang them outside.

242
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:23,652
This, that!

243
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:26,160
He will always blame the Indians;

244
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,232
they don’t know how to eat on a table,

245
00:13:28,232 --> 00:13:33,498
they use their hands, this that. Indians!

246
00:13:33,523 --> 00:13:35,510
Not embittered at all!

247
00:13:35,518 --> 00:13:37,808
They are the only people who have really forgiven.

248
00:13:37,838 --> 00:13:40,338
There is no embitterment and you know, in India

249
00:13:40,338 --> 00:13:42,838
it’s a law, unwritten law.

250
00:13:42,838 --> 00:13:47,574
I was on the censor board, that no
film can be made against the English.

251
00:13:47,591 --> 00:13:48,684
Nothing!

252
00:13:48,701 --> 00:13:52,224
No film is made about our freedom,
independence or about Gandhi.

253
00:13:52,224 --> 00:13:56,758
 This is an Englishman who made it.

254
00:13:56,768 --> 00:13:59,268
We were not allowed to do that.

255
00:14:02,234 --> 00:14:11,533
There was a big series, very popular series showing how awful the British had been to the Indians, which was on in England.

256
00:14:11,564 --> 00:14:15,144
They always tried to debase
Indians, to make fun of them.

257
00:14:15,144 --> 00:14:24,313
Everybody’s horrified, because we
don’t know. We just read in the books

258
00:14:24,343 --> 00:14:26,843
What is the name of the series?

259
00:14:26,923 --> 00:14:31,083
The Jewel in the Crown! It’s called “The Jewel in the Crown”.

260
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:36,033
It is about the last days of the British
Raj. And it is horrible. You can't watch.

261
00:14:36,028 --> 00:14:37,193
I mean, what do they show there.

262
00:14:37,185 --> 00:14:40,605
They show bestiality, they show absolute cruelty,

263
00:14:40,638 --> 00:14:45,785
beating some boy with sticks, accusing
him of raping a girl that he never did.

264
00:14:45,812 --> 00:14:46,937
Who? English?

265
00:14:46,951 --> 00:14:47,707
English, yes.

266
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,467
They did?

267
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,697
It shows the English in a very bad light. Very bad!

268
00:14:57,448 --> 00:15:01,797
Good, it's being at least exposed.

269
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:04,317
Somebody must have talked about it.

270
00:15:04,317 --> 00:15:09,717
When we watched the film of Gandhi, in
Delhi, when you took us to see that movie,

271
00:15:09,699 --> 00:15:13,454
at the half time, everybody walked out.

272
00:15:13,474 --> 00:15:18,244
About forty of the British Sahaja yogis
were just absolutely like stunned mullets

273
00:15:18,244 --> 00:15:20,104
they couldn’t move.

274
00:15:20,123 --> 00:15:21,314
 That is nothing,

275
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:24,514
They have shown nothing, compared
to what people have seen.

276
00:15:24,514 --> 00:15:27,214
This series is much more brutal than that.

277
00:15:27,244 --> 00:15:29,744
Watching it was so horrible.

278
00:15:29,744 --> 00:15:30,655
I heard about it.

279
00:15:30,655 --> 00:15:31,835
Horrible.

280
00:15:31,835 --> 00:15:37,385
And you see now, as they were saying
there were no arches or bridges.

281
00:15:37,425 --> 00:15:40,875
Now, the British must have
removed everything that was there.

282
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:44,705
They never respected anything. Even now
they have no respect for our culture,

283
00:15:44,723 --> 00:15:47,945
for our music, for anything.

284
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:51,015
They haven’t got brains to understand.

285
00:15:53,366 --> 00:15:56,326
In such ego!

286
00:15:56,332 --> 00:16:00,006
Shri Mataji, you were saying this
afternoon that a lot of the culture, and

287
00:16:00,015 --> 00:16:07,742
history and architecture and so on, of India
predates, so much, a lot of the west.

288
00:16:07,776 --> 00:16:15,395
Most! I mean, I told them that
these people say Greeks brought us all these things,

289
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:20,775
but, they have not seen that in India we have something called Ajanta Caves.

290
00:16:20,775 --> 00:16:21,895
Made in the caves!

291
00:16:21,904 --> 00:16:30,364
Caves mean like palaces, huge and
one stone, huge, for miles like that.

292
00:16:30,376 --> 00:16:33,534
I said, if we have learned from the Greeks,

293
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:37,556
why don’t the Greeks have something like that.

294
00:16:37,564 --> 00:16:39,536
 They don’t have anything.

295
00:16:39,536 --> 00:16:45,316
The kind of art we have in our country, you don’t
find it anywhere in the whole world, I think.

296
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:53,058
I mean this now... I've said it of
course, (unclear) but it is built from down upwards.

297
00:16:57,818 --> 00:17:02,808
It is a cave, you see, from top downwards, in ten centuries.

298
00:17:04,488 --> 00:17:09,000
Excuse me, Mother, do you want me to translate
for the people that doesn’t understand?

299
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:11,530
Please, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

300
00:18:06,718 --> 00:18:09,218
All the engineering, everything
had to be calculated from...

301
00:18:14,239 --> 00:18:23,419
She’s explained that, what you explained today
that we started from the roof and then we go down...

302
00:18:23,433 --> 00:18:26,436
Like you were explaining today to this fellow.

303
00:18:26,456 --> 00:18:28,956
You explained today to [unclear] today

304
00:18:28,956 --> 00:18:31,226
that we start from the roof and then we go down,

305
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:34,940
not from the firmament we go up, it’s just the same.

306
00:18:34,984 --> 00:18:40,612
It’s India style. It’s a very clever.

307
00:19:04,486 --> 00:19:10,686
Yes, Mother, but she would just like
to ask some questions about Masonry,

308
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:13,180
but you were talking about Ajanta, and perhaps
it’s better You finish…

309
00:19:13,196 --> 00:19:14,636
That I've finished off

310
00:19:14,641 --> 00:19:17,476
You finish Your talk.

311
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:25,710
No, I am just saying that the Indians, you see,
have got something about them,

312
00:19:25,703 --> 00:19:28,203
that they are very forgiving.

313
00:19:28,203 --> 00:19:31,913
There is no embitterness in them, they’re very forgiving.

314
00:19:31,913 --> 00:19:35,393
They don’t carry any embitterness in their mind.

315
00:19:35,403 --> 00:19:40,012
And secondly, they are very anonymous.

316
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:43,483
You will never find name written in any painting.( unclear)

317
00:19:43,502 --> 00:19:46,792
You will never find an Indian
writing the name or anything.

318
00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:50,776
This is all modern. Of course, modern
people, they are westernised.

319
00:19:50,774 --> 00:19:54,124
But even now, you go anywhere
and ask them, 'Who has done it?"

320
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:57,824
Somebody, someone must have done it?

321
00:19:57,824 --> 00:20:00,967
That ego.

322
00:20:00,977 --> 00:20:07,187
Very anonymous people and that is only because
it is a very spiritual country, you see.

323
00:20:07,204 --> 00:20:09,317
The whole tradition is of spirituality.

324
00:20:09,334 --> 00:20:11,834
That’s why people are very spiritual,

325
00:20:11,834 --> 00:20:14,948
they are not so materially equipped,

326
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:21,587
because they never paid much
attention to material advancement, you know.

327
00:20:21,608 --> 00:20:26,177
Perhaps Mother, I know that Coomaraswamy.

328
00:20:26,198 --> 00:20:29,778
Coomaraswami is the greatest Indian critic.

329
00:20:29,778 --> 00:20:36,342
and now everybody has set him
as a master in Indian art.

330
00:20:36,342 --> 00:20:43,372
I read all of his book and he is an excellent man,
I think. Perhaps he is also realised, I don't know.

331
00:20:43,388 --> 00:20:44,312
What is his name?

332
00:20:44,312 --> 00:20:45,982
Coomaraswamy!

333
00:20:45,982 --> 00:20:48,892
Coomaraswamy!

334
00:20:48,922 --> 00:20:51,422
  Coomaraswamy, I have not read it.

335
00:20:51,422 --> 00:20:55,482
 I think he is a good man.

336
00:20:56,858 --> 00:21:06,707
He said also that they didn’t
write their name on the [unclear]

337
00:21:07,668 --> 00:21:15,018
just because they see himself
just as an instrument of God,

338
00:21:15,018 --> 00:21:17,128
he was just a channel of God.

339
00:21:17,128 --> 00:21:19,628
He was nothing, just a channel and in fact

340
00:21:19,628 --> 00:21:26,542
a man who worked in Ellora just
wrote on the walls of Ellora,

341
00:21:26,536 --> 00:21:32,302
“Oh God, how I made it." And he was just meaning that...

342
00:21:32,322 --> 00:21:33,822
You are... I am the instrument.

343
00:21:33,822 --> 00:21:39,742
“I am just an instrument, God. Because,
I couldn’t do it, You have done it”. And...

344
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,912
It is very beautiful.

345
00:21:41,912 --> 00:21:47,942
And we couldn't understand it in our culture
Mother, we think that we do “I do, I do, I do.”

346
00:21:47,967 --> 00:21:51,492
But they say “God, You do, I am just a channel.”

347
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:55,182
That’s the reason, but you see,
but we had a very bad invasion

348
00:21:55,182 --> 00:21:58,540
of the tantrikas with the
same kind of thing, you see,

349
00:21:58,536 --> 00:22:04,462
that those people who started practicing meditation.

350
00:22:04,482 --> 00:22:10,554
And perhaps they saw Ganesha at Mooladhara
and they thought this is the Kundalini.

351
00:22:10,554 --> 00:22:17,829
They started taking to sexual things
and all that, and did all wrong things.

352
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:24,209
Then they found out that they went into the realm
of the subconscious, the collective subconscious.

353
00:22:24,209 --> 00:22:26,709
Then, they got the bhoots in their heads.

354
00:22:26,709 --> 00:22:34,871
They got ideas that, if you can
destroy the purity of a temple,

355
00:22:34,887 --> 00:22:37,387
then you can get all the bhoots there.

356
00:22:37,387 --> 00:22:42,742
So, they tried to destroy all the temples
with their horrible tantric things.

357
00:22:42,774 --> 00:22:45,274
 Erotics they put in, to insult the Goddess.

358
00:22:45,274 --> 00:22:52,022
 If you insult the Goddess, she goes away from there. Supposing, say before me, somebody is misbehaving, I’ll go away.

359
00:22:52,022 --> 00:22:54,344
Like that, to remove the attention.

360
00:22:54,362 --> 00:22:56,254
And the tantrism started.

361
00:22:56,262 --> 00:23:01,055
But, you know, we had no idea
that tantrism is like that.

362
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:02,475
We never see these things.

363
00:23:02,475 --> 00:23:07,875
 I, myself went to Nepal with my
children, my daughters, my husband

364
00:23:07,905 --> 00:23:10,855
and we saw all the temples.
We never saw anything erotic.

365
00:23:10,863 --> 00:23:12,563
Never saw!

366
00:23:12,583 --> 00:23:16,313
Then when I went to Gregoire, went to write
the book. He said, "Mother it's everywhere."

367
00:23:16,323 --> 00:23:17,753
I said, "Where?"

368
00:23:17,753 --> 00:23:22,973
There were some Japanese with
some zoom lenses, you see,

369
00:23:22,983 --> 00:23:25,801
with these.. .sticks. These....

370
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:26,701
Tripod.

371
00:23:26,705 --> 00:23:30,865
What you call? These ladders.

372
00:23:30,916 --> 00:23:34,025
They had brought all the
ladders from Japan, you see?

373
00:23:34,025 --> 00:23:36,106
In India, you don’t get this kind of ladder.

374
00:23:36,106 --> 00:23:40,685
Ladders with zoom lenses, standing there.

375
00:23:40,716 --> 00:23:42,755
and somebody falling and somebody (unclear)

376
00:23:42,746 --> 00:23:44,015
I said, "What are they doing?"

377
00:23:44,015 --> 00:23:46,515
He said, "They are taking photographs of these erotics."

378
00:23:46,515 --> 00:23:51,635
 I said, "At that point what do these men want to see?"

379
00:23:51,635 --> 00:24:02,009
These Japanese, I tell you, even somebody
was doing work on this... your...

380
00:24:02,034 --> 00:24:05,752
I think.... in Sistine Chapel, some Japanese.

381
00:24:05,774 --> 00:24:10,232
And he enlarged all
the private parts of all the things,

382
00:24:10,248 --> 00:24:12,748
 Every body's!

383
00:24:15,758 --> 00:24:19,071
Can you believe these dirty people?

384
00:24:20,858 --> 00:24:23,358
So, this is what it is. You see, we had an attack,

385
00:24:23,358 --> 00:24:24,758
we would not say no.

386
00:24:24,752 --> 00:24:26,632
But, these tantrikas came in,

387
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:28,832
in the Advent it is given these things..

388
00:24:28,852 --> 00:24:30,422
Yes.

389
00:24:30,432 --> 00:24:34,534
These tantrikas did come
and they did attack us.

390
00:24:34,534 --> 00:24:37,922
But we are innocent, we never
knew these things at all.

391
00:24:37,922 --> 00:24:41,232
And in India, we don’t know
many things, I tell you.

392
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,307
I did not know what was homosexual,

393
00:24:43,307 --> 00:24:45,490
I had no idea and when,

394
00:24:45,479 --> 00:24:49,040
you see, somebody explained to me I
really didn’t eat my food for 8 days.

395
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:51,540
 I couldn’t believe there could be such people.

396
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:54,040
Many people don’t know there are such people.

397
00:24:54,040 --> 00:25:00,277
In India, I think at least 90% of people don’t know. At least!

398
00:25:00,277 --> 00:25:01,177
Maybe 95.

399
00:25:01,177 --> 00:25:03,677
May I just say Mother?

400
00:25:59,124 --> 00:26:01,064
Mother, just another thing,

401
00:26:01,064 --> 00:26:06,791
You know that in all Italy is impossible
to find books about the Indian art.

402
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:13,545
It is really impossible, but you can find
a book about all the erotics out of India,

403
00:26:13,565 --> 00:26:15,035
about all the erotics out of China.

404
00:26:15,063 --> 00:26:18,568
Because we did not know anything existed,

405
00:26:18,583 --> 00:26:21,928
we did not know anything existed like this.

406
00:26:21,943 --> 00:26:24,443
We had no idea anything was there.

407
00:26:24,443 --> 00:26:29,708
It is only in the West when we came, 'Oh
this is Kaama, this is..." What is this?

408
00:26:29,718 --> 00:26:30,758
Kamasutra!

409
00:26:30,739 --> 00:26:34,888
 Kamasutra. How many Indians have
read this book, even heard about it?

410
00:26:34,886 --> 00:26:37,386
What is that?

411
00:26:37,386 --> 00:26:39,886
I mean it's pornography.

412
00:26:41,996 --> 00:26:43,899
How can you have pornography?

413
00:26:43,878 --> 00:26:47,419
 But here people are, I mean, I don’t
know what sort of people they are.

414
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:50,909
Educated, uneducated,
everybody viewed pornography?

415
00:26:53,419 --> 00:26:55,919
What is the level?

416
00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:01,384
I had never known there were
books written like that Kamasutra.

417
00:27:01,384 --> 00:27:03,884
This must be some tantrika must
have written long time back.

418
00:27:03,884 --> 00:27:06,979
During the Gupta age, Mother.

419
00:27:07,014 --> 00:27:07,509
Is it?

420
00:27:07,509 --> 00:27:08,819
Yes, Mother.

421
00:27:08,819 --> 00:27:09,879
Gupta Age?

422
00:27:09,879 --> 00:27:19,009
A little before the Gupta age, because You
know Gupta-ism, [unclear] capitalism in India.

423
00:27:19,009 --> 00:27:20,459


424
00:27:20,446 --> 00:27:27,956
Gupta, it cannot be, because in the 7th
century, the tantrism took root 6th century,

425
00:27:27,961 --> 00:27:32,376
after the... after the birth of...

426
00:27:32,391 --> 00:27:33,491
Adi Shankara

427
00:27:33,491 --> 00:27:37,991
Adi Shankaracharya it took roots, real roots.

428
00:27:38,025 --> 00:27:39,531
But could be other.

429
00:27:39,535 --> 00:27:48,925
It really took a complete form in a very
big way, Tantrism, after the 6th century.

430
00:27:48,936 --> 00:27:52,198
Just to oust Shankaracharya.

431
00:27:53,658 --> 00:27:57,238
And then the Buddhist, they went into tantric.

432
00:27:58,408 --> 00:28:02,430
And these Masonics are another
tantrics in the Occident.

433
00:28:05,373 --> 00:28:08,958
Masonry is Tantrism.

434
00:28:12,943 --> 00:28:16,175
But still, Indian people are very innocent.

435
00:28:17,905 --> 00:28:20,143
You won’t find such people anywhere.

436
00:28:20,143 --> 00:28:23,563
Even Africans are not like that,
nor Russians are not like that.

437
00:28:23,578 --> 00:28:25,278
They are very innocent, they don’t understand.

438
00:28:25,278 --> 00:28:30,678
Such a big man like that Modi, he's a stupid
fool, he doesn’t understand anything.

439
00:28:34,565 --> 00:28:37,065
 He is worse than Me.

440
00:28:38,592 --> 00:28:40,122
 Completely innocent.

441
00:28:40,122 --> 00:28:42,622
Absolutley!

442
00:28:45,652 --> 00:28:48,802
and they remain potent until they die,

443
00:28:48,832 --> 00:28:51,332
because they are so innocent.

444
00:28:54,742 --> 00:28:57,242
This is all bathroom culture.

445
00:29:01,212 --> 00:29:04,272
Khajuraho all that is extremely...

446
00:29:04,272 --> 00:29:07,176
and we never even saw all
these things. We were surprised.

447
00:29:07,229 --> 00:29:13,606
Khajuraho is the worst, because the
architect himself was a Tantric.

448
00:29:13,616 --> 00:29:16,116
That is the worst, Khajuraho

449
00:29:16,116 --> 00:29:19,846
No, not Khajuraho, Konark. Konark is the worst.

450
00:29:19,867 --> 00:29:24,056
But Khajuraho, the king was a very bad man.

451
00:29:25,168 --> 00:29:28,578
And his disciples,

452
00:29:28,584 --> 00:29:32,619
 no, no, his ministers were Jains.

453
00:29:32,643 --> 00:29:35,829
They wanted to have Jain temples.

454
00:29:35,837 --> 00:29:40,377
So, to please the king they said
alright, we’ll have erotics outside.

455
00:29:40,397 --> 00:29:42,717
But they had to tell all kinds of stories to the artists.

456
00:29:42,717 --> 00:29:45,497
They had competition. Artists
were very clever, you see,

457
00:29:45,497 --> 00:29:47,997
they made very thin erotic pictures,

458
00:29:48,007 --> 00:29:51,761
and Gods & Goddesses are very healthy, fat.

459
00:29:51,761 --> 00:29:54,827
And in one corner, you see,
I did not know where it was.

460
00:29:54,815 --> 00:29:58,017
I went throughout Khajuraho without seeing anything.

461
00:29:58,005 --> 00:30:03,431
So, I told one lady, “I have read there are
erotics, what is that? I would like to see.”

462
00:30:03,422 --> 00:30:06,361
So she came around, "In this corner, that corner."

463
00:30:06,392 --> 00:30:11,461
And one could not see because all the
Europeans and all were so busy there.

464
00:30:13,512 --> 00:30:19,007
And Mother if you open [unclear] and ask book about
India, you just see this picture. All right.

465
00:30:19,007 --> 00:30:20,857
Only Khajuraho

466
00:30:20,857 --> 00:30:23,587
Indian art from the book is only Khajuraho

467
00:30:23,587 --> 00:30:24,847
Can you imagine?

468
00:30:24,847 --> 00:30:27,347
And Konark, Khajuraho and Konark.

469
00:30:27,347 --> 00:30:29,847
And we didn’t even see these things.

470
00:30:29,847 --> 00:30:32,347
You know, we went with our
daughters. Can you imagine?

471
00:30:32,347 --> 00:30:38,027
My husband, they won’t even see a
film together with my daughters.

472
00:30:38,027 --> 00:30:42,497
 He’s so shy and we went to Nepal, we never knew.

473
00:30:42,509 --> 00:30:46,099
My son-in-law who has been so many
days in Nepal, he did not know.

474
00:30:46,099 --> 00:30:46,859
Can you imagine?

475
00:30:46,879 --> 00:30:49,579
This is Romel, who seems to
be a very intelligent man.

476
00:30:50,939 --> 00:30:53,049
He didn’t know anything.

477
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:59,243
But it is very far-fetched you know.

478
00:31:01,859 --> 00:31:04,043
You have to really zoom lenses to see that.

479
00:31:04,072 --> 00:31:06,572
Yes Mother, on the roof.

480
00:31:12,952 --> 00:31:15,452
 I mean, can’t understand.

481
00:31:16,932 --> 00:31:23,714
Of course, it entered into our sculpture and all
that in 10th century, but not so visible.

482
00:31:23,714 --> 00:31:26,214
But they went to another limit of things,

483
00:31:26,214 --> 00:31:28,974
these Kings, some of them, were very bad Kings,

484
00:31:28,974 --> 00:31:34,091
but they were after the 7th
century, and they did it.

485
00:31:34,091 --> 00:31:37,864
But we Indians don’t know.

486
00:31:37,881 --> 00:31:42,571
 I’ve read lots of Sanskrit, I should
say, my mother was a Sanskrit scholar.

487
00:31:42,591 --> 00:31:44,261
My father was a Sanskrit scholar,

488
00:31:44,288 --> 00:31:48,868
but they never knew there was a book called Kamasutra.

489
00:31:48,868 --> 00:31:51,681
We never knew, I mean, it was like pornography.

490
00:31:51,691 --> 00:31:54,951
I mean, you don't bring pornography
for an educated man, do you?

491
00:31:54,951 --> 00:31:57,659
I mean, do you study pornography?

492
00:31:57,711 --> 00:32:01,939
Is it done here for research? Do you have?

493
00:32:01,981 --> 00:32:03,899
They have art exhibitions of it.

494
00:32:03,899 --> 00:32:08,319
They have big, big art exhibitions
of pornography and erotica.

495
00:32:08,321 --> 00:32:09,219
For what?

496
00:32:09,219 --> 00:32:13,939
Art exhibitions, in the big public galleries.

497
00:32:15,569 --> 00:32:17,529
Really?  Yes.

498
00:32:19,639 --> 00:32:22,966
I mean, you mean you have PhD’s on that, do you?

499
00:32:22,954 --> 00:32:23,592
Probably.

500
00:32:23,592 --> 00:32:26,092
Not in Italy Mother, nor European.

501
00:32:26,113 --> 00:32:28,392
In Spain, I think it is.

502
00:32:28,403 --> 00:32:30,903
One week, erotic  culture.

503
00:32:36,444 --> 00:32:43,041
They have one week, they have that red
rag for the bull and then next week

504
00:32:43,064 --> 00:32:45,564
they have this erotica.

505
00:32:45,564 --> 00:32:48,064
Stupid people.

506
00:32:51,537 --> 00:32:54,785
What can I do with them, tell
me? Now I have to go to Spain.

507
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,237
I have been in Spain....

508
00:33:01,237 --> 00:33:01,857
You have been?

509
00:33:01,887 --> 00:33:04,040
two months and I found also yogis

510
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:06,758
Then why don’t you go and see the Sahaja Yogis?

511
00:33:06,788 --> 00:33:07,658
I will, Mother.

512
00:33:07,658 --> 00:33:10,568
Poor, this Don. I went with his wife.

513
00:33:12,538 --> 00:33:18,108
She is now in Barcelona, but now we have a centre also in Madrid

514
00:33:18,127 --> 00:33:20,281
and we have Spanish people there.

515
00:33:20,281 --> 00:33:21,131
I met them, Mother

516
00:33:21,131 --> 00:33:22,211
You met them?

517
00:33:22,242 --> 00:33:28,858
I met them, Mother and I convinced them
to come to the Guru Puja and they come.

518
00:33:28,858 --> 00:33:30,192
Very good.

519
00:33:30,192 --> 00:33:36,828
Nice people, very nice, poor things, but, you
see, the majority is nonsensical like that.

520
00:33:36,852 --> 00:33:39,352
They’re so stupid. My husband went to Spain,

521
00:33:39,352 --> 00:33:43,065
they gave him a present of an erotic thing, you see?

522
00:33:43,065 --> 00:33:46,189
 I said, "What is this you have got?"

523
00:33:46,225 --> 00:33:47,449
I said, “Who gave you?”

524
00:33:47,475 --> 00:33:49,975
He said, "There’s something special for you.

525
00:33:49,975 --> 00:33:52,227
Very secretly they gave me”

526
00:33:52,245 --> 00:33:55,527
I said “This is erotics.” He said,  “Throw it away.”

527
00:33:55,515 --> 00:33:57,977
These stupid people wanted to insult me.

528
00:33:57,977 --> 00:33:59,407
Same in Greece.

529
00:33:59,407 --> 00:34:02,387
In Greece, they gave him erotic stuff, you see.

530
00:34:02,397 --> 00:34:05,929
To me, they gave me Mary’s face.

531
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:09,029
He said, “What do they think me
to be?” And he threw it away.

532
00:34:12,163 --> 00:34:17,389
They think it is intellectual.
They show their freedom, perhaps.

533
00:34:17,409 --> 00:34:21,439
Freedom is what? Bathroom? Bathroom freedom.

534
00:34:21,423 --> 00:34:29,123
 I think, in all Spain, they say that
now is a reaction of the Catholic church,

535
00:34:29,102 --> 00:34:31,602
with the previous government.

536
00:34:31,602 --> 00:34:32,463
Franco!

537
00:34:32,463 --> 00:34:39,313
He is worst, forced them. Oppressing them, in all sense.

538
00:34:39,335 --> 00:34:41,835
Now is the reaction, they say, to the Catholic church.

539
00:34:41,835 --> 00:34:44,335
But that means you have no personality.

540
00:34:44,335 --> 00:34:45,365
Liberation!

541
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:52,015
 Liberation, the drugs, it’s published, even the
minister said why not to smoke marijuana.

542
00:34:54,095 --> 00:34:59,194
In every bar you have slot machines, in every bar.

543
00:34:59,219 --> 00:35:03,495
Now supposing you have a problem
because of Catholic church,

544
00:35:03,519 --> 00:35:05,219
 say they suppressed you.

545
00:35:05,219 --> 00:35:07,719
So, must you become stupid?

546
00:35:08,359 --> 00:35:11,569
No, I mean, you must have some
personality of your own, isn’t it?

547
00:35:13,766 --> 00:35:16,266
And whatever Catholic church preached

548
00:35:16,266 --> 00:35:19,182
there was nothing wrong with it. I
don’t think there was anything wrong,

549
00:35:19,182 --> 00:35:21,192
what they said was correct.

550
00:35:21,212 --> 00:35:24,812
But they did not give you the power to do that.

551
00:35:24,822 --> 00:35:27,322
The Catholic church themselves
did not have the power,

552
00:35:27,322 --> 00:35:29,822
 nor did they give you the power to do that.

553
00:35:29,822 --> 00:35:33,798
After Sahaja Yoga, you see it is very easy.

554
00:35:36,692 --> 00:35:42,308
You enjoy it, being virtuous. Isn’t it?

555
00:36:53,663 --> 00:36:56,514
I mean, human beings have
become nothing but sex points.

556
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:05,411
See? I mean, even the dogs and the
monkeys and the donkeys have it.

557
00:37:05,407 --> 00:37:07,337
What is so special about it?

558
00:37:07,357 --> 00:37:09,187
You see, people talk about sex here.

559
00:37:09,217 --> 00:37:13,327
You see, in India those, who are
... what we call the hijras people;

560
00:37:14,497 --> 00:37:17,677
the people who are third person.

561
00:37:17,691 --> 00:37:19,974
Eunach

562
00:37:20,007 --> 00:37:21,647
Hermaphrodites.

563
00:37:21,674 --> 00:37:24,174
You see, and they talk about having a child,

564
00:37:24,174 --> 00:37:27,097
that’s how human beings talk here.

565
00:37:27,124 --> 00:37:30,960
Sex is so natural what is so great about it?

566
00:37:34,570 --> 00:37:36,704
I just don’t understand, really.

567
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:39,190
I think these are impotent people who'll...

568
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:43,330
To them, it is great thing, to talk about sex, perhaps.

569
00:37:43,330 --> 00:37:46,640
What is there to talk and to educate, what is there?

570
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,960
It is so natural.

571
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:53,862
To be...  first of all, you have all become unnatural
and then behave like unnatural people.

572
00:37:55,892 --> 00:37:59,120
It’s all unnaturalness, that’s why you are like this.

573
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:04,690
Horrible it is. Absolutely horrifying.

574
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:10,820
Despite all that, we produce
more children than you do.

575
00:38:10,828 --> 00:38:14,338
We have potent men and women.

576
00:38:14,358 --> 00:38:16,858
We have very good married lives.

577
00:38:16,858 --> 00:38:19,358
And we enjoy everything that we have.

578
00:38:20,338 --> 00:38:22,838
What have you achieved out of your sex?

579
00:38:22,838 --> 00:38:27,978
Nothing. Divorce, rapist, this, that, prostitution.

580
00:38:54,867 --> 00:38:57,847
Without Sahaja Yoga, there is no solution, Shri Mataji

581
00:38:57,847 --> 00:39:00,897
Without Sahaja Yoga, there is no solution, right?

582
00:39:00,897 --> 00:39:03,397
There is no solution.

583
00:39:03,397 --> 00:39:05,897
No solution

584
00:39:05,871 --> 00:39:10,576
They are all going in a mass way to hell, straight.

585
00:39:11,464 --> 00:39:13,487
Direct to hell.

586
00:39:13,504 --> 00:39:16,004
I mean what are they becoming? Just think of it.

587
00:39:17,524 --> 00:39:24,047
It is sensational, this that, nonsense, as if like dead
bodies, you see they need sensations all the time.

588
00:39:24,697 --> 00:39:30,396
Mother, We were so blind, that we
couldn’t see what we had lost.

589
00:39:30,401 --> 00:39:35,486
It is so much. How can we try to
explain to the people what we have lost?

590
00:39:35,493 --> 00:39:36,021
It is too much.

591
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:38,520
It will happen, gradually they will.

592
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:41,020
You don’t have to talk about
their past. Forget the past.

593
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:44,337
You see gradually, because you
develop innocence, you see?

594
00:39:44,350 --> 00:39:48,287
Innocence comes into your eyes.
The relationships are so pure.

595
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:53,420
So relationships are pure, no complications. Nothing. So beautiful.

596
00:40:22,610 --> 00:40:27,270
And with purity of relationship
only, your married lives will be alright.

597
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:30,980
Otherwise, every man, his wife
is running with another woman.

598
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:34,990
Err... with another man and the man
is running with another woman.

599
00:40:34,999 --> 00:40:37,050
What sort of morality is that?

600
00:40:37,039 --> 00:40:39,994
Complete confusion,

601
00:40:40,009 --> 00:40:43,414
Complete confusion, it is nonsense.

602
00:40:46,539 --> 00:40:49,039
It is nonsense.

603
00:40:52,303 --> 00:40:53,987
I can’t understand this.

604
00:40:56,177 --> 00:41:01,607
I tell you, there’s a gentleman, he became my rakhi brother.

605
00:41:01,633 --> 00:41:04,133
You see once he just tied a rakhi.

606
00:41:04,133 --> 00:41:06,463
So I tied him a rahki,

607
00:41:06,463 --> 00:41:07,953
 because he had no sister.

608
00:41:07,983 --> 00:41:12,483
So, he must be about now, 70 years
of age, or something like this.

609
00:41:12,506 --> 00:41:15,713
Once I was going to Bombay, uh, to Delhi.

610
00:41:15,698 --> 00:41:21,218
So my husband said, "Alright, you better go
with him because he is going by train."

611
00:41:21,241 --> 00:41:24,138
So he booked a coupé for both of us. You see!

612
00:41:24,171 --> 00:41:26,258
And we went together. I mean he is my brother.

613
00:41:26,258 --> 00:41:31,776
So my brother from his wife and from
my husband as if he is my brother

614
00:41:31,776 --> 00:41:33,706
And we went by coupé

615
00:41:33,726 --> 00:41:37,746
and when we reached there my husband came
to receive me with some foreigners also.

616
00:41:37,746 --> 00:41:40,766
They were quite surprised. They said,
“Are you divorced Mr Shrivastava?”

617
00:41:40,783 --> 00:41:41,856
He said, "No!"

618
00:41:41,906 --> 00:41:43,556
But she is coming out with another man.

619
00:41:43,556 --> 00:41:46,056
“That’s her brother.” "Oh brother!"

620
00:41:46,056 --> 00:41:47,477
"But doesn’t look like her.”

621
00:41:47,501 --> 00:41:50,001
He said, “That’s her brother, she
has accepted him as a brother.”

622
00:41:50,001 --> 00:41:54,934
But brother cannot travel in
the same coupé, under law.

623
00:41:54,934 --> 00:42:01,944
If there’s a brother and a sister, they
can’t live in one room, under law.

624
00:42:01,974 --> 00:42:05,944
What a filth it is!

625
00:42:05,994 --> 00:42:10,414
 Can you imagine? There is no purity
between real brothers and sisters.

626
00:42:10,456 --> 00:42:15,428
Here is just a brother, which..sort of a Rakhi brother.

627
00:42:15,448 --> 00:42:18,158
Imagine, and never goes into our heads.

628
00:42:18,158 --> 00:42:22,537
Nothing, not even my husband’s head,
or his wife’s head or anything.

629
00:42:30,352 --> 00:42:32,677
So, this is something surprising

630
00:42:32,677 --> 00:42:34,162
that people don’t understand

631
00:42:34,162 --> 00:42:38,842
that, as you have to have rules and
regulations for a good civic life,

632
00:42:38,865 --> 00:42:46,459
for good married life also there has to be certain
rules and regulations which are to be respected.

633
00:42:46,499 --> 00:42:51,159
For your good married life, there
has to be some rules and regulations.

634
00:43:00,518 --> 00:43:04,705
Otherwise, how can you have a good married life?

635
00:43:04,694 --> 00:43:07,655
That is not, that is not curbing yourself.

636
00:43:07,686 --> 00:43:14,176
Every freedom has to have certain rules and
regulations so that the freedom is preserved.

637
00:43:14,176 --> 00:43:18,316
For the preservation of the freedom only.

638
00:43:19,873 --> 00:43:22,148
This is abandonment. Licence...

639
00:43:22,988 --> 00:43:24,483
Maryada Purushottama.

640
00:43:24,483 --> 00:43:25,743
Yes.

641
00:43:25,743 --> 00:43:28,243
Maryada Purushottam

642
00:43:29,173 --> 00:43:33,943
This is licence. This is not... this
is in no way freedom. It is licence.

643
00:43:35,403 --> 00:43:37,903
It is abandonment.

644
00:43:39,421 --> 00:43:40,991
Do you see my point?

645
00:43:40,991 --> 00:43:45,301
This is in no way this is freedom.

646
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:46,331
What is freedom?

647
00:43:46,309 --> 00:43:47,591
The husband is worried about the wife.

648
00:43:47,574 --> 00:43:48,811
Wife is worried about the husband.

649
00:43:48,797 --> 00:43:50,339
Actually, we are free people.

650
00:43:50,336 --> 00:43:52,096
Like my husband goes all over the world

651
00:43:52,096 --> 00:43:53,469
and I know for definite

652
00:43:53,443 --> 00:43:55,413
he is not going to look at any woman.

653
00:43:55,434 --> 00:43:57,223
And he knows for me also,

654
00:43:57,229 --> 00:44:00,743
so we are free people moving everywhere, happily.

655
00:44:01,962 --> 00:44:03,733
This is the true freedom, Mother

656
00:44:03,763 --> 00:44:06,362
It’s the true freedom.

657
00:44:06,384 --> 00:44:09,222
Yes, we are the free people

658
00:44:09,249 --> 00:44:10,329
Supposing now,

659
00:44:10,306 --> 00:44:11,939
he is there, in the house he comes,

660
00:44:11,950 --> 00:44:13,740
if he sleeps in the same bed

661
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:16,070
my husband won’t doubt it, won't doubt it.

662
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:17,080
He is like my son.

663
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:17,990
Of course!

664
00:44:17,976 --> 00:44:20,476
My sons-in-law will come and sleep with me.

665
00:44:20,496 --> 00:44:21,845
You won't believe.

666
00:44:22,831 --> 00:44:24,315
They sleep on the same bed.

667
00:44:24,299 --> 00:44:26,665
“Just hug me, Mummy, Mummy.”

668
00:44:26,665 --> 00:44:27,975
Nobody says anything.

669
00:44:27,975 --> 00:44:29,505
Nobody can even think,

670
00:44:29,505 --> 00:44:32,485
you know, it doesn’t go into our heads.

671
00:44:35,335 --> 00:44:36,375
I can’t understand.

672
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:38,520
With all this thinking

673
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:40,420
if people have become mad, like this,

674
00:44:40,428 --> 00:44:41,640
just sex points.

675
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:43,240
I mean you have reduced yourself to nothing

676
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:45,740
but sex points.

677
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:48,240
Think about it? What a degradation!

678
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,740
We were like that before the Realisation.

679
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:55,650
But now you have become Shri Ganeshas.

680
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:57,390
You all have become Shri Ganeshas.

681
00:44:57,375 --> 00:44:59,490
You have become such great people now.

682
00:44:59,505 --> 00:45:02,200
But I think, still, I can’t forgive the English

683
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:04,700
for what they did to You.

684
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:19,820
English people now has, in South America,

685
00:45:19,806 --> 00:45:23,260
people are [unclear] against English people,

686
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:25,760
just because of Malvinas. (the Falkland Islands.)

687
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:26,680
The what?

688
00:45:26,697 --> 00:45:29,940
The war, that they did unto Argentina.

689
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:31,857
I didn't understand?

690
00:45:31,842 --> 00:45:32,303
Argentina?

691
00:45:32,291 --> 00:45:33,943
Yes, Argentina war with England

692
00:45:33,956 --> 00:45:37,143
The Malvina Islands

693
00:45:37,163 --> 00:45:38,993
That war was... people don't like it

694
00:45:38,972 --> 00:45:43,249
I have seen in all South America,
I usually go by, my job.

695
00:45:43,249 --> 00:45:49,789
Unclear

696
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:51,338
That was very stupid.

697
00:45:51,357 --> 00:45:54,326
(Tape cuts out and resumes)

698
00:45:55,517 --> 00:45:58,678
Germans were teaching them and
they had those goose steps.

699
00:45:58,678 --> 00:46:01,777
Do you know what is a goose step
is? Left right, left right,

700
00:46:01,798 --> 00:46:04,857
and I asked, "How is it that you know all this?"

701
00:46:04,868 --> 00:46:06,678
They kept quiet.

702
00:46:06,678 --> 00:46:07,848
I said, "This is German."

703
00:46:07,848 --> 00:46:13,738
And there are lots of Germans who have built
up their bases there, horrible Germans.

704
00:46:13,768 --> 00:46:17,043
So in a way, it is I agree
that they should not have,

705
00:46:17,043 --> 00:46:18,793
 but Argentina is saved,

706
00:46:18,761 --> 00:46:23,191
because these Germans would
have really finished them off.

707
00:46:25,678 --> 00:46:28,009
On Friday, I have been in Buenos Aires

708
00:46:28,017 --> 00:46:30,189
I came to the Puja.

709
00:46:30,187 --> 00:46:35,807
And I feel now, there is a group waiting for You

710
00:46:35,817 --> 00:46:38,857
or maybe waiting for me to make the decision.

711
00:46:38,866 --> 00:46:41,706
I spoke about You and they are really waiting.

712
00:46:41,695 --> 00:46:45,926
They’ll get it. They’ll get it, because,
you see, their prestige has gone.

713
00:46:45,926 --> 00:46:48,176
Argentina is in the UN, and all that.

714
00:46:48,177 --> 00:46:51,711
 They have not lost much prestige.
English has lost prestige more.

715
00:46:51,711 --> 00:46:55,093
But the Germans are finished.

716
00:46:55,083 --> 00:46:57,363
They were horrible people there, Germans.

717
00:46:57,339 --> 00:47:01,373
And Germans were training all their
military, all their navy, everything.

718
00:47:01,373 --> 00:47:03,873
They have built a huge, big barricade,

719
00:47:03,873 --> 00:47:06,983
which I have seen Myself

720
00:47:07,013 --> 00:47:08,653
and I was quite frightened.

721
00:47:08,652 --> 00:47:10,713
So, in a way it's good.

722
00:47:10,713 --> 00:47:16,447
In a way it’s good, in a way also
Argentina has not lost prestige.

723
00:47:16,457 --> 00:47:18,277
So it's alright. Doesn’t matter.

724
00:47:18,311 --> 00:47:23,377
In the war, though, English has won the
war, Argentina has not lost its face, no doubt.

725
00:47:23,397 --> 00:47:25,897
People feel that Argentina was not wrong,

726
00:47:25,897 --> 00:47:28,397
in keeping Falklands.

727
00:47:28,397 --> 00:47:32,317
And still, there is a lot of
reaction against Mrs Thatcher.

728
00:47:32,317 --> 00:47:37,427
The other day they were asking her,
“How did you bombard that ship?"

729
00:47:37,427 --> 00:47:39,927
People detest Mrs Thatcher.

730
00:47:41,897 --> 00:47:46,345
The truth of the real aggressiveness
is coming out now in the war files.

731
00:47:46,357 --> 00:47:52,035
It is all being exposed, as to how they
overdid the boundaries of normal defense.

732
00:47:52,018 --> 00:47:53,645
Changing the course of the ship also,

733
00:47:53,645 --> 00:47:57,625
 the ship went and bombarded
and two hundred sixty-five (unclear)

734
00:47:57,625 --> 00:48:00,125
So all this, prestige wise they have not lost.

735
00:48:00,125 --> 00:48:02,625
But these Germans are reduced
I am very happy about them,

736
00:48:02,625 --> 00:48:05,125
because these Germans, if you
allow them to grow like that.

737
00:48:05,125 --> 00:48:07,625
They are still in Chile, Mother, now.

738
00:48:07,605 --> 00:48:10,626
They are still in Chile now.

739
00:48:10,657 --> 00:48:11,146
Chile

740
00:48:11,146 --> 00:48:13,646
They have moved in Chile?

741
00:48:13,666 --> 00:48:18,917
They are now there, with Pinochet
and all these people, doing the same.

742
00:48:18,927 --> 00:48:26,067
But Chile people are also…Chile
government is very, very tough government.

743
00:48:26,077 --> 00:48:28,337
Shri Mataji, they’d like to give you dinner now.

744
00:48:28,337 --> 00:48:29,939
All right?

745
00:48:29,939 --> 00:48:33,749
Thank You very much for talking to us.

746
00:48:47,559 --> 00:48:51,587
I’m going to eat what you have brought for me.
