NOTE Language: en

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:06.870
I am in a dilemma what language I should speak
to you all.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:18.750
First I’ll speak in English, then in Hindi,
then in Marathi.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:43.210
We all have come here to Kolhapur to worship
the Mahalakshmi.

00:00:43.210 --> 00:01:04.170
And you all know about the importance of Mahalakshmi.

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:17.300
That Sushumna Nadi is the channel for Mahalakshmi.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:33.610
But this principle of Mahalakshmi is only
possible to manifest in us when our principle

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:41.240
of Lakshmi is satisfied.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:48.600
When we see poverty in India we really get
very upset about it, and think: “When will

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:58.630
it be all right, when all these people will
also get the blessings of the Divine?”

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.670
[Hindi aside]

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:10.800
So the principle of the Divine works through
Mahalakshmi.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:20.540
It’s a vicious circle that you have to get
to a point where your Lakshmi principle is

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:31.140
satisfied and then only you start seeking,
and that seeking comes from the Mahalakshmi

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:39.120
principle within us.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:49.170
So Sahaja Yoga grows in the middle path, in
the middle section of the society.

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:57.700
Very rich will seldom come to Sahaja Yoga,
and if they come only, they’ll just take

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:03.490
few advantages of it, and they won’t understand
the depth of it.

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:06.660
In the same way the poor cannot come.

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:16.810
So these are like the two shores of one river
that is flowing in between, and if we start

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:25.560
expanding it, then we will definitely shower
the blessings of the Divine on all both the

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:32.970
shores, and I’m sure lots of people who
look today to be poor, and who appear to be

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:40.050
rich, will definitely become Sahaja Yogis.

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:53.570
It’s such a vicious circle – that unless
and until you become a Sahaja Yogi, your financial

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:58.140
situations cannot be improved very much.

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:04.569
But you cannot become Sahaja Yogi unless and
until you have got your principle of Lakshmi

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:05.760
satisfied.

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:14.920
But how do we get our Lakshmi principle satisfied?

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:25.129
– That we should see.

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:44.810
That when we have little more money than required,
then we start thinking: “What shall I do

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:47.360
with this money?”

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:52.580
Then some people think: “All right, I’ll
have one more car, I’ll have one more house,

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:56.050
I’ll have one more this, more that."

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.080
But sagacity sets in.

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:05.249
A kind of a satisfaction sets in: “Now,
what more?”

00:05:05.249 --> 00:05:13.479
In addition to that we have taxations, thanks
to the government, and all kinds of problems.

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:18.550
So people think: “Now, I’ve had enough
of it, now no more, finished with it."

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:21.639
So the hankering goes away.

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:22.889
Hankering for money goes away.

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:31.089
In Sahaja Yoga you are so blessed that you
start getting whatever you like, and at a

00:05:31.089 --> 00:05:38.020
point you reach and you think: “Oh wah,
too much, now no more – I’ve all."

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:46.050
This is also another way, even before your
Lakshmi principle is satisfied, that if you

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:52.529
get your Self Realization you can short-circuit
the whole thing.

00:05:52.529 --> 00:05:59.729
If that is short-circuited, then also you
can enter into Mahalakshmi principle.

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:14.330
But in case where your situation is such that
now you have become overly rich, and if that

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:22.529
richness has gone into your head and you think
no end of yourself, then there are still some

00:06:22.529 --> 00:06:26.060
chances of you getting into Sahaja Yoga.

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:36.190
For example, if a very rich man is there,
if he gets sick, if he gets cancer, or his

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:44.309
children start misbehaving, or he suddenly
gets a bad reputation somewhere, some sort

00:06:44.309 --> 00:06:53.389
of a shock from his right side can push him
to the center.

00:06:53.389 --> 00:07:03.020
Now the left-sided people are, who are suffering
too much because they are poor, because they

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:11.619
are lethargic, because they don’t know how
to get to their jobs, they have no ambitions,

00:07:11.619 --> 00:07:14.249
nor do they compete.

00:07:14.249 --> 00:07:21.969
In a way they’re in a better situation than
the rich, because they don’t have to worry

00:07:21.969 --> 00:07:29.469
so much about income tax, as if they have
solved their problems by having no income,

00:07:29.469 --> 00:07:30.469
no car.

00:07:30.469 --> 00:07:34.479
If you have no car then you have, you don’t
have problems of car.

00:07:34.479 --> 00:07:42.939
If you have no – I’ve done that way; I’ve,
I never drive, so somebody has to drive Me.

00:07:42.939 --> 00:07:45.839
I can go by bus, I can go by rickshaw, anything.

00:07:45.839 --> 00:07:50.409
But if you drive, then you have to drive all
the rest of the people!

00:07:50.409 --> 00:08:01.159
If you have got, say, a house, you have a
problem.

00:08:01.159 --> 00:08:06.529
Everything that you possess, so-called, you
have a problem.

00:08:06.529 --> 00:08:14.389
And till you develop a complete detached feeling
about it, the problems are there.

00:08:14.389 --> 00:08:21.319
So then what happens to you, that when you
start, all these problems creeping up.

00:08:21.319 --> 00:08:26.789
In India specially I’ve seen, people become
generous, very miserly people also become

00:08:26.789 --> 00:08:32.590
generous because they become so fed up with
their so-called wealth that they start distributing

00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:35.180
it and giving it away.

00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:41.419
So the principle of Lakshmi is to give away,
to be generous.

00:08:41.419 --> 00:08:46.779
That principle starts working.

00:08:46.779 --> 00:08:55.350
Then the second principle of Lakshmi also
works with them when they have very nice beautiful

00:08:55.350 --> 00:09:02.380
houses and things, then they want people to
come to their house, stay there, see; look

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:09.160
after, I mean, look after them and give them
food and, I mean, they enjoy all this giving

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:15.470
parties, or maybe money, anything.

00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:18.610
So this generosity starts.

00:09:18.610 --> 00:09:20.250
But that generosity also is not very satisfying.

00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:27.110
They think that: “Still this generosity
is getting into my head, I’m still feeling

00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:36.300
as if I have done some great job, you see,
by being generous."

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:45.699
Then this generosity, when it doesn’t satisfy
them, then they start thinking of getting

00:09:45.699 --> 00:09:47.889
to the truth of life.

00:09:47.889 --> 00:09:53.190
There’s a story about Shivaji, very interesting
story.

00:09:53.190 --> 00:10:00.020
He was once building a very huge big fort.

00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:04.810
And people were working and he was just looking
at them, and he thought: “See now, what

00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:06.329
a nice thing I am doing.

00:10:06.329 --> 00:10:08.760
I have given so much work to so many poor
people."

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:12.990
And he was feeling quite happy about it.

00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:15.360
And he was looking at them.

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:21.139
Suddenly his guru, Ramdas Swami came there,
and they were breaking one boulder.

00:10:21.139 --> 00:10:24.490
They said: “Slowly, slowly break it.

00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:25.949
Do not hit it hard."

00:10:25.949 --> 00:10:33.629
They were breaking slowly, ultimately they
came to a stone which was just like one coconut.

00:10:33.629 --> 00:10:41.139
So Ramdas Swami took that coconut in his hand
and broke it, and there was water in it and

00:10:41.139 --> 00:10:46.180
there was a frog sitting inside.

00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:53.889
Then Shivaji Maharaj realized that when God
creates you, He also provides you with things.

00:10:53.889 --> 00:10:57.620
You need not be proud that you are doing so
much for others.

00:10:57.620 --> 00:11:03.459
So in this generosity in the social work and
so-called doing for the poor, also, you develop

00:11:03.459 --> 00:11:08.250
a kind of a very funny ego and think no end
of yourself.

00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:13.940
And to pamper it also, people can give you
a peace prize, can give you a Nobel prize,

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:15.930
this prize, that prize.

00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:22.690
Then of course there’s a very hard nut they
create out of your brains.

00:11:22.690 --> 00:11:28.259
That is how even this generosity can be very
dangerous, which creates this kind of a feeling

00:11:28.259 --> 00:11:34.910
that we are something great, and we are doing
this great work, and we are just looking after

00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:42.019
so many people.

00:11:42.019 --> 00:11:49.069
So then we come to another kind of people
who are really very miserly.

00:11:49.069 --> 00:11:51.029
They can never change.

00:11:51.029 --> 00:11:54.680
I think it’s a disease, with people who
are miserly.

00:11:54.680 --> 00:12:01.310
They are extremely miserly, and sometimes
I see the whole nation is of a miserly nature.

00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:15.589
They talk of money, and there’s no decency
about it.

00:12:15.589 --> 00:12:21.730
Many countries, who are supposed to be very
rich, we’re surprised that the people of

00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:30.819
that country are not only miserly but indecent,
and can’t understand how they could be like

00:12:30.819 --> 00:12:33.079
that: there’s no culture about it.

00:12:33.079 --> 00:12:39.510
Like somebody came with us and we went to
a hotel for a dinner.

00:12:39.510 --> 00:12:44.129
And after the dinner lots of things were left
over, so they got up and said: “Pack it

00:12:44.129 --> 00:12:45.129
for us."

00:12:45.129 --> 00:12:50.649
We Indians, I mean, we started looking here
and there: “What is this?”

00:12:50.649 --> 00:12:52.399
“Oh, we paid for it."

00:12:52.399 --> 00:12:57.139
Doesn’t matter, you can’t just say – do
that in this country.

00:12:57.139 --> 00:13:01.750
So there’s no shame, there’s no decency,
there’s no decorum about it.

00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:08.710
This is the greatest curse of being rich.

00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:22.569
People become absolutely shameless, indecent,
arrogant and above all, absolutely irreligious.

00:13:22.569 --> 00:13:29.129
So one has to fear now, those things which
are so illusory and look like something being

00:13:29.129 --> 00:13:42.870
very, very great to achieve, how they can
make a human being so horrible, so indecent.

00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:50.910
Because the rich have no manners at all of
any kind, they have no maryadas of any kind,

00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:57.089
and they don’t care for what others are
going to say, or what they have to be.

00:13:57.089 --> 00:14:10.830
So such rich countries have gone from left
to right, right to left, like a yo-yo, and

00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:11.830
are still doing the same.

00:14:11.830 --> 00:14:20.509
And also the kind of a ego that comes into
a rich man is really very stupid, extremely

00:14:20.509 --> 00:14:26.080
stupid, and people would laugh at them, the
way they behave.

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:36.199
You must have heard about the king who made
chappals out of pearls, and there are people

00:14:36.199 --> 00:14:46.950
who are trying to show off their wealth in
the most hideous manner.

00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:54.019
To them, to show off their wealth is the only
criteria, but whether it is decent or whether

00:14:54.019 --> 00:15:00.069
it is decorous, or then, is it some sort of
a very cultured behavior, they’re not bothered.

00:15:00.069 --> 00:15:08.010
They are the people who are killers of culture,
and that’s how we find the people or the

00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:15.680
countries which are rich, absolutely kill
all the culture, all the behavior, heart of

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:16.810
human beings.

00:15:16.810 --> 00:15:24.720
And the second thing they get into is complete
immorality, complete immorality: they have

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:27.399
no morals of any kind.

00:15:27.399 --> 00:15:39.410
To them a girl of twenty years is the same
as a fiancé, whether they are 80 years of

00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:40.500
age.

00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:50.240
They have no sense of proportion; extremely
immoral, live a very immoral and an absolutely

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:57.610
low-graded life which even an animal would
not do.

00:15:57.610 --> 00:16:05.870
So they get even not only human, sub-human,
but sub-animal also.

00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:13.120
So all the decency that comes from your culture,
or all the norms that are described about

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:15.480
the culture, just disappear.

00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:22.749
Ha, they may have a decency as to what glass
should be used for which wine.

00:16:22.749 --> 00:16:29.480
Or could be what sort of a dress should be
worn for a particular thing, but even that

00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:31.810
is gone now.

00:16:31.810 --> 00:16:38.079
Anything is possible: “What’s wrong?”

00:16:38.079 --> 00:16:52.779
This arrogance of a very incorrigible ego
is even thickened when there are five, six

00:16:52.779 --> 00:16:57.270
more like them, because a competition starts.

00:16:57.270 --> 00:17:02.110
One says one thing so another says even a
higher thing than that, and the third one

00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:07.130
starts to compete and says something more
than that; and there’s a going on, and on,

00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:18.750
and on, and on between these people, all kinds
of horrible expressions of their ugly wealth.

00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:20.990
The whole society becomes so ugly.

00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:28.500
It so happened, unfortunately, that I had
to be with such people also.

00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:35.610
But thank God I have My own people, now you
are here, My own style, My own type.

00:17:35.610 --> 00:17:46.640
All of you are here, so close to Me, so much,
and what an atmosphere you have created.

00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:52.870
Even people in Kolhapur and here are all saying:
“We have never seen such beautiful people,

00:17:52.870 --> 00:17:54.850
so well behaved, so balanced.

00:17:54.850 --> 00:17:57.380
They never fight.

00:17:57.380 --> 00:18:02.400
They never say bad words, and they never hit
each other."

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:07.130
Because whatever we had known of foreigners
was this, that they would come, enter into

00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:12.210
any house -during the time of British – and
get whatever they wanted.

00:18:12.210 --> 00:18:17.250
And later on – these were soldiers – and
later on came the hippies.

00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:24.550
Then came Hari Ramas, one after the another,
one better than the other.

00:18:24.550 --> 00:18:29.640
All these horrible experiences, and then you
people coming like great blessings.

00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:31.430
They are so impressed by you.

00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:48.850
They are more impressed by you than by Me,
I can tell you this much!

00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:56.380
I knew that this would happen when they will
see lots of Sahaja Yogis together, the way

00:18:56.380 --> 00:19:02.060
they live, the way they enjoy each other,
the way they have a nice time, and the way

00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:04.610
they are detached about things.

00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:09.500
Definitely they’ll be very much impressed,
and that’s what is happening today.
