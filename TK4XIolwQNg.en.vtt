00:03:16.679 --> 00:03:20.734
So the New Year is coming, 82',

00:03:20.935 --> 00:03:24.829
expected to be a very dynamic year for

00:03:25.029 --> 00:03:31.850
Sahaja Yoga and for Sahaja Yogis.

00:03:32.051 --> 00:03:39.788
Everything new becomes stale and never
becomes new again.

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:45.989
So whatever has gone
has gone – ‘let bygones, be bygones’.

00:03:46.649 --> 00:03:50.360
There have been very sweet memories sometimes,

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.779
sometimes rather unhappy also; but, on the whole,

00:03:55.802 --> 00:04:00.634
we are growing, all of us are realizing,

00:04:00.834 --> 00:04:03.282
coming up.

00:04:03.482 --> 00:04:10.034
We’ve done a good job of building up
ourselves into a new way.

00:04:10.234 --> 00:04:15.362
New Sahaja Yogis have come up, I think, now, who

00:04:15.562 --> 00:04:22.390
have got rid of their lethargy and their
petty-mindedness, their jealousies,

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:32.089
their slyness, their slumber and
narrow-mindedness.

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:37.236
All these things have to be buried in
the past.

00:04:37.436 --> 00:04:43.533
They are of no use to us. It’s
a load we carry for nothing at all.

00:04:43.733 --> 00:04:48.106
Today, it happened that I read a very
nice letter which was lying with Me

00:04:48.136 --> 00:04:53.756
which I didn’t read, which was sent by
Gregoire to Warren.

00:04:53.956 --> 00:04:56.055
It really touched my heart.

00:04:56.255 --> 00:05:02.375
So, he was concerned about the
jealousies that people suffer, and the

00:05:02.575 --> 00:05:10.324
way he said there that this jealousy is
the most sticky stuff and most ugly thing,

00:05:10.524 --> 00:05:15.641
and it comes up as something as a
challenge to your love,

00:05:15.841 --> 00:05:22.145
challenge to your understanding or something like that,

00:05:22.345 --> 00:05:27.064
and then you start explaining it.

00:05:28.158 --> 00:05:31.023
This explanation is all rational.

00:05:31.223 --> 00:05:35.805
In Sahaja Yoga there is nothing like
jealousy. It doesn’t exist.

00:05:36.005 --> 00:05:40.772
It doesn’t exist in
the Kingdom of God, something called ‘jealousy’

00:05:40.972 --> 00:05:45.038
because all are part and
parcel of one Person.

00:05:45.238 --> 00:05:49.315
So, one person becomes important,
another less important – it’s only for

00:05:49.515 --> 00:05:53.807
the time being. For example, when you are smelling a flower,

00:05:53.817 --> 00:05:57.758
naturally the nose is more active than the eyes, but when you are

00:05:57.798 --> 00:06:01.070
seeing the flower, then the eyes are
more active.

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:06.115
So, it is not necessary that, at this moment, when somebody is more active,

00:06:06.316 --> 00:06:10.931
doesn’t mean that he is closer to God and another person who is inactive is not.

00:06:11.132 --> 00:06:14.103
Everybody is [close] but some people are active at a point,

00:06:14.303 --> 00:06:16.299
some people are active at another point.

00:06:16.499 --> 00:06:19.182
Or some people are closer, some people
are a little away,

00:06:19.382 --> 00:06:21.975
but they are all part and parcel.

00:06:22.175 --> 00:06:26.333
So this is one of the things one has to
understand that there should be no jealousy.

00:06:26.534 --> 00:06:31.135
On the contrary, if you find somebody
who is spiritually higher,

00:06:31.335 --> 00:06:34.424
you must try to understand and appreciate him,

00:06:34.624 --> 00:06:40.807
especially a person who is wiser than
you, somebody who speaks wise things.

00:06:41.007 --> 00:06:44.014
If you hear somebody saying something wise,

00:06:44.214 --> 00:06:47.225
try to note it, appreciate it, enjoy it;
you’ll like it.

00:06:47.425 --> 00:06:52.284
Sometimes even the children say
something nice, young people can say something nice.

00:06:52.485 --> 00:06:54.862
What’s happening to the people, are they
coming? From…?

00:06:55.062 --> 00:07:01.120
They are still left there, high and dry. Were you to take
that thing for them?

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:05.878
Somebody had to go
back? Is it Norman? Norman has gone?

00:07:06.078 --> 00:07:07.468
Where is Norman?

00:07:07.478 --> 00:07:12.228
Sahaja Yogi: All the young people left
at your house, either made their way at your house, either made their way

00:07:12.248 --> 00:07:13.758
here or to the hotel.

00:07:13.868 --> 00:07:16.368
Shri Mataji: About 6 people are left out.

00:07:16.338 --> 00:07:19.307
So we could have brought –
Sahaja Yogi: They were still there when you left.

00:07:19.507 --> 00:07:22.198
Shri Mataji: Yes. And they were trying –
two of them tried to, three of them

00:07:22.238 --> 00:07:25.228
tried to squeeze in our this thing
(car), you see. One of them is Graham

00:07:25.278 --> 00:07:28.628
and this and that. But I
told Graham to get down. I said, “These

00:07:28.678 --> 00:07:30.632
others are left out so come with them.”

00:07:30.832 --> 00:07:34.003
I don’t know, they might come by…

00:07:34.073 --> 00:07:36.153
Sahaja Yogi: We can phone them first
before they-

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:38.033
Shri Mataji: Phone is- they are outside
the house now.

00:07:38.053 --> 00:07:39.303
"Sahaja Yogi: Oh, they are outside, are they? they?

00:07:39.383 --> 00:07:41.883
Shri Mataji: They could all come in… I
mean, I don’t know."

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:44.656
Sahaja Yogini: It’s only about 25
minutes on the Underground, Mother.

00:07:44.856 --> 00:07:49.057
Shri Mataji: I know that! But you see
the habits, English habits are there, still lingering.

00:07:49.258 --> 00:07:53.947
Sahaja Yogi: Yeah, they might stand
there. We could go out and get the…

00:07:54.147 --> 00:07:59.084
Shri Mataji: Let’s wait for a while and
see. Let’s wait and see, you see. Let’s

00:07:59.284 --> 00:08:04.131
wait and see, I hope you get it. I hope
you get the thing, and they come back.

00:08:04.191 --> 00:08:09.201
I told them to come together, all of them.
They must be jumping into it, they’ll be here. Alright.

00:08:09.341 --> 00:08:13.991
So the first thing is of jealousy, which
I don’t understand.

00:08:15.321 --> 00:08:21.251
Some of you think that I like someone more than the other.

00:08:21.441 --> 00:08:24.991
To be very frank, I have no idea of liking and disliking,

00:08:25.021 --> 00:08:28.421
I don’t understand that.  It’s no question.

00:08:28.521 --> 00:08:32.541
It’s a very different mechanism you are dealing
with: that person who doesn’t get

00:08:32.531 --> 00:08:36.699
involved into anything, doesn’t get
entangled into anything.

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:40.280
Only thing what I am trying to do is to disentangle you.

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:44.180
If I was an entangling type how can I disentangle?

00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:48.281
You see, If I was the person who has to purify you 

00:08:48.271 --> 00:08:54.901
and if I am the person who cannot purify you 

00:08:54.931 --> 00:08:58.247
then what’s the use of my being there?

00:08:58.347 --> 00:09:02.137
So the person who tries to purify has to be pure himself.

00:09:02.158 --> 00:09:06.361
Supposing there’s a soap and the soap is
the one that gets dirty,

00:09:06.441 --> 00:09:08.950
 then what’s the use of such a soap?

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:12.382
In the same way, I
never get entangled with anyone.

00:09:12.582 --> 00:09:19.543
That’s my name, is Nirmama. To Me, ‘mama’ is
not there – nobody is mine.

00:09:19.743 --> 00:09:27.081
Everybody is mine. So this should get out of your
mind as to Nirmama.

00:09:27.282 --> 00:09:31.969
Shri Mataji: I think we’ll wait till
10,15 minutes because poor Graham, also,

00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:36.979
I asked him to get out for those people
and to bring them along. He’ll be able to do that.

00:09:36.998 --> 00:09:39.238
Sahaja Yogi: We can go in the van Mother

00:09:39.239 --> 00:09:40.848
if they are not here in twenty minutes.

00:09:40.838 --> 00:09:45.628
Shri Mataji: Just wait, just wait. You can give them about 20 minutes more.

00:09:45.648 --> 00:09:47.452
Sahaja Yogi: Did they say there were expecting the van?

00:09:47.471 --> 00:09:52.651
Shri Mataji: No they did not. They’ll
come. 

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:05.530
Alright. So we have to bury this useless thing called jealousy. 

00:10:05.675 --> 00:10:10.923
And it can be a very serious thing. It can happen very serious with people.

00:10:10.949 --> 00:10:13.479
I have seen people, they got jealous, 

00:10:13.539 --> 00:10:15.989
then they got after another person, 

00:10:15.989 --> 00:10:19.369
then they got after Sahaja Yoga, then after me.


00:10:23.686 --> 00:10:27.111
And this jealousy, one should not allow
to crawl into you.

00:10:27.311 --> 00:10:30.765
Some people are more
congenial sometimes, 

00:10:30.845 --> 00:10:35.031
are more nearer Sahaja yoga, sometimes they are more helpful, 

00:10:35.051 --> 00:10:37.271
sometimes they are more useful,

00:10:37.271 --> 00:10:38.771
sometimes they have to be there.

00:10:38.884 --> 00:10:42.464
Sometimes they need me the most of all.
Some of them are lost people.

00:10:42.504 --> 00:10:45.864
 Some of them are really possessed and badly off


00:10:45.864 --> 00:10:48.774
so sometimes that’s why I look after them more.

00:10:48.789 --> 00:10:51.557
 It’s my own whim. I cannot say, I cannot justify.

00:10:51.757 --> 00:10:54.485
Maybe that some person is very good, I
look after.

00:10:54.487 --> 00:10:59.787
Maybe that some person is
very bad, that’s why I look after.

00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:05.521
So one should never have any jealousies
with each other.

00:11:05.721 --> 00:11:11.154
Only you must haveunderstanding that your Mother has to work for all of you

00:11:11.354 --> 00:11:16.369
and has to improve
you, cure you [and] do something about it.

00:11:16.569 --> 00:11:22.598
One thing we have to bury is the
jealousy that is within us.

00:11:22.799 --> 00:11:28.428
We bury something and something comes out very
well, and what is that [which] comes out of this jealousy?

00:11:28.628 --> 00:11:32.723
Is that we have to better ourselves

00:11:32.923 --> 00:11:37.098
so that the outgoing
jealousy should leave within us: “Oh, am

00:11:37.298 --> 00:11:40.066
I jealous of a person?” Then, “What’s

00:11:40.266 --> 00:11:45.219
good in that person? Let’s see.”

00:11:45.419 --> 00:11:48.270
Now, this is not outward. Sahaja Yoga is
not outward.

00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:53.411
If a person is outwardly like this,
outwardly, that’s not, it’s so inward.

00:11:53.611 --> 00:11:57.617
If I correct somebody, I
correct that person

00:11:57.817 --> 00:12:03.170
because the vibrations of that person are not
alright.

00:12:03.371 --> 00:12:06.355
You see, such a person can be extremely
sweet also to talk to, a very sweet

00:12:06.555 --> 00:12:10.449
tongue, could be extremely harsh, could
be anything; 

00:12:10.649 --> 00:12:15.362
but the vibrations of that person has to be alright.

00:12:15.562 --> 00:12:19.791
I have to gain nothing out of you,
except that your vibrations should be corrected.

00:12:19.991 --> 00:12:23.548
So, you should not have any
misidentification with yourself; that

00:12:23.748 --> 00:12:27.798
some people are very dynamic, so they
think they can do what they like.

00:12:27.998 --> 00:12:32.606
Some people think they are very sort of
receding type so (they think) they can

00:12:32.806 --> 00:12:36.192
do what they like – all is wrong.

00:12:36.392 --> 00:12:40.634
First of all, you should not hit collectivity.

00:12:40.834 --> 00:12:44.119
Are you coming from Bramham Gardens? No?

00:12:44.269 --> 00:12:48.537
He’s not come.

00:12:50.195 --> 00:12:53.143
For a mother if some children are left
behind, her heart is there, all the time

00:12:53.343 --> 00:12:57.546
she thinks they are left there, they
should be [here].

00:12:57.746 --> 00:13:00.413
That’s the main thing is, you see, not for one person.

00:13:00.613 --> 00:13:04.184
Like just thinking about your own son or
thinking about your own wife, thinking

00:13:04.384 --> 00:13:07.175
about your own husband is not the point.

00:13:07.235 --> 00:13:11.625
All of you are dearer to Me, dearest to
Me 

00:13:11.687 --> 00:13:18.355
but I belong to no one, I’m a hopeless case! 

00:13:18.625 --> 00:13:20.105
You just give Me up! 

00:13:20.185 --> 00:13:23.275
I belong to no one. No one can possess Me.

00:13:23.285 --> 00:13:27.253
I cannot possess myself, how can you
possess Me?

00:13:27.273 --> 00:13:29.760
I am beyond possession.

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:34.410
Then if it is so, there should be no
jealousies, there’s no question of

00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:40.049
jealousy or in any way feeling jealous
of each other.

00:13:40.249 --> 00:13:42.436
Only the beauty of enjoying others should be there:

00:13:42.636 --> 00:13:45.959
somebody has some great qualities, enjoy
that quality in that person – you’ll

00:13:46.159 --> 00:13:49.796
imbibe it. In Sahaja Yoga, whatever you
enjoy you imbibe,

00:13:49.996 --> 00:13:54.496
do you know that?

00:13:54.697 --> 00:13:59.626
Whatever you enjoy you’ll imbibe – just
like that. You should be able to enjoy it.

00:13:59.741 --> 00:14:03.425
Now supposing you enjoy creating rifts
in people,

00:14:03.476 --> 00:14:05.505
 creating problems in people,

00:14:05.535 --> 00:14:08.085
 you will have that yourself!

00:14:08.715 --> 00:14:12.648
Supposing you enjoy saying harsh things to others, you’ll imbibe that,

00:14:12.848 --> 00:14:15.112
in the sense that you will have more of that 

00:14:15.332 --> 00:14:17.832
whatever you want, you will have it.

00:14:18.004 --> 00:14:21.006
Christ has said, “If you want gold,
you’ll have gold.”

00:14:21.207 --> 00:14:24.849
Many people who came to Sahaja Yoga went away in the search of money,

00:14:25.050 --> 00:14:27.424
promotions this, that – they
got it.

00:14:27.624 --> 00:14:31.861
“You will have gold.” “But those
who are dearer to me 

00:14:32.061 --> 00:14:36.467
will have food with me.
They will sit next to Me on my table.”

00:14:36.577 --> 00:14:42.247
This is what we should ask for.
This is what we are for, not for having

00:14:42.477 --> 00:14:45.095
more gold, for more money, for more

00:14:45.125 --> 00:14:52.562
this, for more that, but that you are
part and parcel of his company.

00:14:52.762 --> 00:15:00.436
Now, somehow, I know every one of you –
somehow, I don’t know how!

00:15:02.402 --> 00:15:04.502
I know every one of you.

00:15:04.762 --> 00:15:09.998
How far you are with things, I
know, there’s no need to justify yourself.

00:15:10.212 --> 00:15:12.972
No need to say, “This is not so. That is not so”. 

00:15:13.492 --> 00:15:15.627
I know everything.

00:15:15.827 --> 00:15:22.548
 I should know otherwise how will I give you something substantial?

00:15:22.749 --> 00:15:27.887
I have to give you something very, very
substantial and for that I have to know

00:15:27.957 --> 00:15:34.061
what you need and when I know, I love you.

00:15:34.091 --> 00:15:36.791
Unless and until you love someone, you
cannot

00:15:36.801 --> 00:15:38.850
know so much about a person.

00:15:39.050 --> 00:15:43.475
I know your beauties and I also know your
ugliness,

00:15:43.675 --> 00:15:47.417
I know your tenderness, I know
your harshness.

00:15:47.617 --> 00:15:50.226
I know all the extremes that you are, 

00:15:50.366 --> 00:15:54.246
that you have been, that you are, and you will be.

00:15:55.172 --> 00:15:59.468
So it is many-dimensional knowledge of a person.

00:15:59.668 --> 00:16:03.007
[With] some of you I expect a bit too
much because I think you are capable,

00:16:03.207 --> 00:16:07.591
because I know your past.

00:16:07.791 --> 00:16:11.427
I’ve worked very hard on you, you know that and I’ll
work,

00:16:11.627 --> 00:16:16.408
I’ll continue to work, every year. But ’82 is a very remarkable year, where

00:16:16.608 --> 00:16:20.515
you people should now work hard for
Sahaja Yoga.

00:16:20.716 --> 00:16:24.046
I have already given some
idea as to how to work it with Gavin, I

00:16:24.056 --> 00:16:29.303
have talked to him. Gavin knows how we
are going to work it out in a systematic

00:16:29.504 --> 00:16:33.662
way; how to attack a particular village,
or a particular district, or wherever

00:16:33.863 --> 00:16:39.283
you have to go how to go there, how to
go propagate, how to establish it.

00:16:39.483 --> 00:16:43.500
Wherever there is soft ground you should
settle down, not in the hard ground.

00:16:43.701 --> 00:16:47.611
The hard ground will never yield any
produce.

00:16:47.811 --> 00:16:50.493
So don’t go on working on a
hard ground.

00:16:50.693 --> 00:16:53.914
Put your attention to this fact that,
“What can I do for Sahaja Yoga?”

00:16:54.114 --> 00:16:56.899
Take out your attention from yourself.
For example,

00:16:57.099 --> 00:17:02.051
supposing a person – now
there are presents all being tied up.

00:17:02.251 --> 00:17:04.981
Supposing a person wanted a particular
present, take it like that.

00:17:05.181 --> 00:17:07.292
Of course, Sahaja Yogis are not that low type but

00:17:07.492 --> 00:17:09.972
still, supposing take the lowest of
lowest, like children.

00:17:10.172 --> 00:17:14.808
So, you don’t get that particular one.

00:17:15.008 --> 00:17:18.743
Now, to do all
this, with all the work I have been

00:17:18.943 --> 00:17:24.608
doing there, to select that and to
arrange all that, isn’t it tremendous?

00:17:24.669 --> 00:17:27.269
So, whatever Mother could do in that
hurry and scurry,

00:17:27.269 --> 00:17:29.379
with everybody’s name and all that

00:17:29.413 --> 00:17:31.149
it is quite a lot to She
has done.

00:17:31.184 --> 00:17:34.364
And if She has done that, one should appreciate 

00:17:34.444 --> 00:17:37.634
the love that Mother wants to bestow upon you,

00:17:37.664 --> 00:17:39.334
and it’s all symbolic.

00:17:39.355 --> 00:17:42.254
But somebody can sit down and
start saying, “Oh, I should have had this.

00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:46.028
Why didn’t She give me this? Why
didn’t She do that. I should have…”

00:17:46.228 --> 00:17:49.989
You see, it is not anything that one has
weighed or anything, just to give

00:17:50.009 --> 00:17:53.335
somebody something, type; in a small
way, I am saying.

00:17:53.535 --> 00:17:59.948
But even in this small way, you are
worried about yourself.

00:18:00.148 --> 00:18:02.761
You have to worry about Sahaja Yoga:

00:18:02.961 --> 00:18:04.747
what’s going to
happen to Sahaja Yoga?

00:18:04.771 --> 00:18:07.367
How is it going to come up?
What have you to work it out?

00:18:07.412 --> 00:18:10.524
What we have to do? How many pujas
do we have to arrange? How do we have to do it?

00:18:11.574 --> 00:18:13.813
Not about yourself. “How should I
improve myself?”

00:18:14.014 --> 00:18:16.941
That point is also – forget it!

00:18:17.141 --> 00:18:20.957
What we are going to do to
propagate Sahaja Yoga, we have to see.

00:18:21.157 --> 00:18:24.898
Not to go to personal life, “my husband
and wife quarrelling,” is there.

00:18:25.098 --> 00:18:27.098
I mean, I’ve had enough of it now!

00:18:27.299 --> 00:18:30.537
I mean, I am not here to settle your marriage disappointment.

00:18:30.737 --> 00:18:34.053
All these nonsensical
things, you forget now.

00:18:34.253 --> 00:18:37.709
Of course, if you have a good marriage, it helps
Sahaja Yoga, no doubt.

00:18:37.909 --> 00:18:40.584
It helps because you get children which are good.

00:18:40.784 --> 00:18:43.876
If the husband/wife are not alright, you might
get very horrible children which may be

00:18:44.076 --> 00:18:46.926
possessed from the very childhood; will
be very difficult,

00:18:47.126 --> 00:18:52.598
they will be realised souls but will be very difficult children.

00:18:52.798 --> 00:18:59.364
So it is important that we should
dedicate ourselves to Sahaja Yoga today,

00:18:59.564 --> 00:19:04.784
to ‘ring out the old’ and bring out
the new which

00:19:04.874 --> 00:19:07.420
is dedicated to Sahaja Yoga –

00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:10.955
not to your personal life,
not to your personal likes and dislikes,

00:19:11.155 --> 00:19:15.010
but [to] what will happen to Sahaja
Yoga. And to be sincere about it, be

00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:19.264
sincere about it. Many people who organise go off their
heads,

00:19:19.464 --> 00:19:23.969
I’ve seen it, somehow. You give
them something to organise: they are

00:19:24.170 --> 00:19:28.432
about to land up in a lunatic asylum.

00:19:28.632 --> 00:19:34.713
You give them something to organise,
make them the leader, finished!

00:19:34.913 --> 00:19:37.139
It happens like that. It goes off the head.

00:19:37.339 --> 00:19:42.045
Somehow or other, you see, there’s a
crack in the head.

00:19:42.245 --> 00:19:46.616
And these – where are you walking now?

00:19:46.816 --> 00:19:50.559
It’s all right.

00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:56.210
So, the cracked head then starts
behaving in such a funny manner, that

00:19:56.410 --> 00:19:59.968
you can’t imagine how far one can go.

00:20:00.168 --> 00:20:03.495
You have to organise, you have to become
right-sided, you have to work hard, no

00:20:03.695 --> 00:20:07.355
doubt, but you need not be right-sided.

00:20:07.555 --> 00:20:11.744
Now, if you work with your right hand,
you don’t become right-sided, do you?

00:20:11.944 --> 00:20:16.822
You don’t develop your ears, nose on one
side, do you?

00:20:17.022 --> 00:20:20.078
Do we? No, we don’t!

00:20:20.279 --> 00:20:24.078
I mean, really, still the nature keeps
the body all right, I must say.

00:20:24.279 --> 00:20:28.467
Because some right-handed people should have a
right-side development,

00:20:28.667 --> 00:20:30.706
or the left hand should
have a left-hand development – it should

00:20:30.907 --> 00:20:33.901
be there, but it’s not so. It keeps nature all right.

00:20:34.101 --> 00:20:39.298
Nature keeps your face all right,
everything all right. It keeps it you there.

00:20:39.499 --> 00:20:48.352
So, one has to know that, when you are
trying to bring in something new in

00:20:48.553 --> 00:20:51.404
yourself, in the New Year say, let’s
talk of the new things, then whatever is

00:20:51.605 --> 00:20:56.085
old and outgoing should be sent away, it
should be thrown away,

00:20:56.145 --> 00:20:58.443
otherwise the new will never come!

00:20:58.644 --> 00:21:02.281
It will shift from here
to here, here to here, the bhoot passes from.

00:21:02.482 --> 00:21:05.324
Thank God you have come! I have been all
the time thinking about you!

00:21:05.514 --> 00:21:09.560
Come along, come along. You should come and you sit down.

00:21:10.563 --> 00:21:13.449
So, today is the list of not feeling guilty

00:21:13.649 --> 00:21:16.761
and thinking what all old things,
old rags

00:21:16.821 --> 00:21:19.531
you had upon yourself – throw it away!

00:21:19.561 --> 00:21:23.252
Change yourself! You see, obstinacy
should not be there. People are very obstinate,

00:21:23.452 --> 00:21:26.901
they don’t want to change,
they don’t want to forget, they don’t want to forgive.

00:21:27.101 --> 00:21:30.990
Give up that obstinacy! Obstinacy is not
the nature of your Spirit.

00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:34.552
If you are the Spirit, you’ll never be obstinate.

00:21:34.752 --> 00:21:38.759
Have you ever seen me being obstinate, ever?

00:21:38.959 --> 00:21:41.566
You said, “Mother, sit here.” “All
right.” You said, “Sit there.” “All

00:21:41.766 --> 00:21:45.762
right.” Did I say, “No, I am going to
sit here alone”?

00:21:45.962 --> 00:21:49.534
Never, never I do that. You say, “Mother, will you eat this?”

00:21:49.735 --> 00:21:54.487
“All right,” Even if I am very, very
full Iìll say, “All right”.

00:21:54.687 --> 00:21:58.248
Sometimes I should put down my foot but I do not,
but I accept,

00:21:58.258 --> 00:22:01.366
“It’s all right, whatever
you say is all right.”

00:22:01.566 --> 00:22:06.706
So, you should also not be at all obstinate.

00:22:06.906 --> 00:22:10.417
There should be not obstinacy. There
should be no fanaticism.

00:22:10.617 --> 00:22:13.307
It’s all a play going on. So, just play this way, that

00:22:13.507 --> 00:22:17.937
way, that way, this way – just enjoying
yourself.

00:22:18.138 --> 00:22:20.245
So, this is one thing that, if you are
obstinate,

00:22:20.445 --> 00:22:23.604
you cannot become a new person.
To become a new person, you have

00:22:23.804 --> 00:22:27.593
to give up your obstinacy – completely.

00:22:27.793 --> 00:22:31.194
Once you give up your obstinacy, you
will be very happy to change, and you

00:22:31.394 --> 00:22:34.241
must change, you must come as a new
person.

00:22:34.441 --> 00:22:39.961
Every minute, every second you
are changing.

00:22:40.711 --> 00:22:46.470
So, I just –
Hello, Athena, (a baby) how are you? 

00:22:49.555 --> 00:22:55.188
Her eyes were glistening as soon as she saw me!

00:23:00.015 --> 00:23:08.646
Now, as far as Sahaja Yoga is concerned in England,
I think it has taken good roots.

00:23:08.676 --> 00:23:11.047
Propagation has to be done, it

00:23:11.056 --> 00:23:15.056
has to be publicised, it has to be
talked about.

00:23:15.176 --> 00:23:16.991
People are to be told you have found it.

00:23:17.191 --> 00:23:21.906
Go and see people who are seekers.
In whatever level you are,

00:23:22.106 --> 00:23:26.301
supposing you are dealing with a
particular type,

00:23:26.501 --> 00:23:29.607
say a lawyer is there,
a lawyer should meet all the lawyers.

00:23:29.808 --> 00:23:32.574
A psychologist is there, should go and
see the psychologists.

00:23:32.774 --> 00:23:36.224
You see, at your level, whomsoever you meet, you should

00:23:36.309 --> 00:23:39.894
talk about it to others that, “This is
what it is, we have found out – 

00:23:39.954 --> 00:23:41.892
why don’t you get hold of it?” 

00:23:41.912 --> 00:23:47.224
And you will all get hold of those people who are
really seekers.

00:23:47.425 --> 00:23:52.428
You must talk now and that is what is
another – get out of your shyness.

00:23:52.628 --> 00:23:57.289
That is very important to get out of your
shyness, talk to people.

00:23:57.489 --> 00:24:02.557
But I have seen people, when they talk
about Sahaja Yoga, instead of bringing a

00:24:02.607 --> 00:24:05.804
good name to Sahaja Yoga, they bring a
bad name.

00:24:06.004 --> 00:24:10.068
Because when they talk, they talk in such a way as if they have reached heaven!

00:24:10.269 --> 00:24:13.469
That’s not good. We have
to say that, “We are just the same.

00:24:13.549 --> 00:24:18.689
"We are just the old legs and we are just
trying to talk to you because we have found something.”

00:24:18.735 --> 00:24:20.689
So that others are not hurt.

00:24:20.742 --> 00:24:22.925
So, for that, you have to remember the
past – that,

00:24:23.125 --> 00:24:26.120
“We were like this, and if
somebody had talked to us like this, we

00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:29.412
would have been hurt, so, we have to
remember our past”.

00:24:29.612 --> 00:24:32.920
Remembering the past
just for your own manoeuvring, 

00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:35.935
that’s all, not as a part and parcel of you,

00:24:36.135 --> 00:24:38.900
but just for your manoeuvring, how to
deal with others.

00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:41.509
Unless until you remember your past, you

00:24:41.592 --> 00:24:46.956
will not know how to deal with others
and you won’t have compassion.

00:24:47.558 --> 00:24:52.193
So that is what we have to see, the importance
of the past.

00:24:52.393 --> 00:24:58.103
The future at this present moment is
that ’82 is a great year, that’s all,

00:24:58.193 --> 00:25:01.421
not more than that.
You don’t have to think about ’83

00:25:01.631 --> 00:25:05.006
because even if you start doing it in
’83,’82 will be silent.

00:25:05.206 --> 00:25:07.749
“We’ll do it in ’83, Mother. What do you think?”

00:25:07.949 --> 00:25:11.694
“I think,” “I believe.” 

00:25:11.894 --> 00:25:15.151
“It would be a better idea to do this in ’83.

00:25:15.351 --> 00:25:22.272
What do you think Mother?”
Suggestions! “I have a suggestion to make.

00:25:22.472 --> 00:25:27.257
Supposing we do it in ’83?”

00:25:27.457 --> 00:25:32.394
Why not today? Why not now?

00:25:32.594 --> 00:25:35.808
Ask a question, “Why not?” 

00:25:36.008 --> 00:25:38.938
When such a thing comes – why not now? 

00:25:39.048 --> 00:25:41.998
And then, whatever you do, you do it fully, 

00:25:42.028 --> 00:25:45.218
completely, to the finishing point.

00:25:45.642 --> 00:25:51.029
My experience has been very good with
you when we were working in that house.

00:25:51.230 --> 00:25:53.999
You were chiselling the house and I was
chiselling you.

00:25:54.069 --> 00:25:56.289
You were building the house and
I was building you. 

00:25:56.329 --> 00:25:58.949
It was very good, interesting, very nice. 

00:25:58.999 --> 00:26:01.499
Some of you have really gained a lot, really

00:26:01.530 --> 00:26:04.440
gained a lot. You have really become
very dynamic, 

00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:06.970
very beautiful, very Sahaja.

00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:09.532
Quite a lot of you have done that,

00:26:09.572 --> 00:26:15.133
I know that, and it is really very
appreciative work that you have done,

00:26:15.107 --> 00:26:17.458
anybody can see that very clearly.

00:26:17.658 --> 00:26:21.869
You are being described by Blake that you
will be the Golden Builders.

00:26:22.069 --> 00:26:25.330
Clearly, it’s all done with the golden painting
you do.

00:26:25.530 --> 00:26:30.578
But in that we have to learn certain things,

00:26:30.778 --> 00:26:34.953
like now they are painting, all
right. The painter goes up to paint.

00:26:35.068 --> 00:26:39.198
He takes a place to sit down on top. When
he comes out, painting is there, but

00:26:39.218 --> 00:26:41.928
 but with that [also] all the mismanagement 

00:26:41.938 --> 00:26:43.978
(mess) that was done is still there.

00:26:44.028 --> 00:26:47.598
The painter has finished the painting [but]
still the scaffolding is there, the seat

00:26:47.638 --> 00:26:52.238
is there, the thing on which he was
sitting, the cushion, is there, all the

00:26:52.428 --> 00:26:55.118
chairs that were removed that are there,

00:26:55.208 --> 00:26:57.708
all the carpet that was disturbed is

00:26:57.738 --> 00:27:00.398
there are just the same. 

00:27:00.608 --> 00:27:04.438
It takes hardly ten minutes to put it right.

00:27:05.396 --> 00:27:09.657
So, this is the future, this is the
future.

00:27:09.857 --> 00:27:12.631
The future is that, when you do something, 

00:27:12.831 --> 00:27:17.685
see that the future is sealed
of that person.

00:27:17.885 --> 00:27:20.614
See that the situation is sealed again.

00:27:20.814 --> 00:27:23.470
You give Realisation to
somebody, see that it is fixed!

00:27:23.671 --> 00:27:26.160
So, remember the past for your
manoeuvring, and remember the future for

00:27:26.361 --> 00:27:30.607
sealing it up so that it is not lost in
the future.

00:27:30.807 --> 00:27:36.228
This is the importance of looking into the future.

00:27:38.639 --> 00:27:42.628
Experience of the past should give you
manoeuvring,

00:27:42.828 --> 00:27:46.766
should give you idea as to what is to be done.

00:27:46.966 --> 00:27:52.858
And when you do something in the present,
you must compensate for the future, in

00:27:53.059 --> 00:27:56.145
the sense that, at that moment, you must
do some things by

00:27:56.345 --> 00:28:02.321
which the future is not ruined.

00:28:04.060 --> 00:28:08.922
This is how New Year’s celebration
should be,

00:28:09.122 --> 00:28:13.306
that, ’82 is important, in ’82 whatever we have learnt from the

00:28:13.326 --> 00:28:17.610
past, we’ll remember, we’ll not do the
same mistakes.

00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:22.485
Not only [that], but also we will
remember whatever past has taught us.

00:28:22.685 --> 00:28:26.305
We’ll have compassion for the people who
have been like us.

00:28:26.505 --> 00:28:28.798
We’ll have love for them, we’ll have
understanding, we’ll do

00:28:28.998 --> 00:28:31.632
whatever is possible to bring them up.

00:28:31.832 --> 00:28:34.513
We’ll have concern, we’ll not just be
just Sahaja Yogis, you see,

00:28:34.713 --> 00:28:40.136
sweet-talking Sahaja Yogis, but we’ll do
something about them.

00:28:40.336 --> 00:28:43.912
So many are lost in intellectual pursuits, so many are

00:28:43.912 --> 00:28:46.852
lost in financial pursuits, so many are

00:28:46.883 --> 00:28:49.252
lost in political pursuits and so many

00:28:49.270 --> 00:28:52.586
are lost in so-called service pursuits.

00:28:52.786 --> 00:28:56.984
All of them belong to some category and
you had belonged to one of these

00:28:56.964 --> 00:28:59.959
categories, so you have to think of
them, try to bring them out, do

00:29:00.159 --> 00:29:06.221
something about it. Have a wider
personality.

00:29:06.421 --> 00:29:09.182
When you have a small personality you
think of your wife, yourself, nothing

00:29:09.382 --> 00:29:12.697
more than that, or your children at the
most.

00:29:12.897 --> 00:29:15.001
But when you are a wider personality
you just think,

00:29:15.201 --> 00:29:18.883
“What will happen to the people who belong to this clan?”

00:29:19.083 --> 00:29:23.333
who belong to, say, Catholicism,
those who belong to Judaism, those who

00:29:23.533 --> 00:29:28.692
belong to Methodist Church and to, to

00:29:28.892 --> 00:29:34.009
Jamaicans, and to…like that! (Laughter)

00:29:34.209 --> 00:29:37.175
Have a wider personality. Don’t worry about yourself.

00:29:37.376 --> 00:29:40.671
I have known people who will come and ask,
“Mother, where should I find my keys?”

00:29:40.871 --> 00:29:49.379
“Mother, where should I put my basket?”
“Mother, where should I stick my nose?”

00:29:51.660 --> 00:29:56.460
“What should I do about my luggage?”
“What should I do about my travelling?”

00:29:56.660 --> 00:29:58.976
All nonsensical things they’ll come and ask me!

00:29:59.176 --> 00:30:03.231
I’m not here to give you all that.
Every small thing they will ask.

00:30:03.431 --> 00:30:06.278
Now if you tell them, “Why are you doing
it?” “You said it.”

00:30:06.478 --> 00:30:09.919
I didn’t say that you ask me every
time you have to raise a finger.

00:30:10.119 --> 00:30:16.650
“Mother, may I raise my finger.
May I close my eyes? May I smile?”

00:30:16.850 --> 00:30:22.685
It’s not that. You are people, who in my
eyes are saints –

00:30:22.885 --> 00:30:27.168
you can decide for yourself, of course.
You are saints.

00:30:27.369 --> 00:30:31.363
You have to assume. You don’t know you are
saints. Assume you are saints.

00:30:31.443 --> 00:30:35.413
This assumption must come to you on this
great auspicious day –

00:30:35.453 --> 00:30:36.908
that you are saints.

00:30:37.108 --> 00:30:40.672
And saints have to decide for themselves
and they have to do wise things.

00:30:40.873 --> 00:30:45.083
They do it by themselves because they are saints!

00:30:45.133 --> 00:30:48.243
If they fight, quarrel amongst themselves, then this is stupidity,

00:30:48.323 --> 00:30:50.813
absolute stupidity, it doesn’t behove.

00:30:50.843 --> 00:30:55.593
He is here to solve the problems of
others.

00:30:56.094 --> 00:30:59.666
What am I to tell you anything?
You are saints, that’s all I say.

00:30:59.867 --> 00:31:01.893
If you ask me any question the answer is,

00:31:02.094 --> 00:31:04.099
“You are saints, do what you like!”

00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:06.725
Whatever you want you will have.
Whatever you say it will happen.

00:31:06.925 --> 00:31:11.309
Whatever you ask for it will happen.
Whatever you imagine will work out.

00:31:11.510 --> 00:31:14.744
But you will imagine something good, you
will say something good, you will do

00:31:14.945 --> 00:31:18.440
something that is Divine.

00:31:18.641 --> 00:31:24.598
You are so great. You are made like that.
You are that.

00:31:24.799 --> 00:31:30.145
Assume, assume that power that you
are a saint.

00:31:30.346 --> 00:31:36.882
How can you say something nonsensical?
Nirmala Vidya is at your disposal, it’s

00:31:37.082 --> 00:31:44.487
at your complete command – complete
Nirmala Vidya.

00:31:44.687 --> 00:31:48.605
Imagine the Nirmala Vidya nobody had
except for you Sahaja Yogis have.

00:31:48.805 --> 00:31:51.275
Nobody had. Even Brahma, Vishnu,
Mahesha never had it.

00:31:51.475 --> 00:31:55.212
Can you believe it?
They have their own powers but you

00:31:55.412 --> 00:31:59.498
have Nirmala Vidya.

00:31:59.698 --> 00:32:02.721
And now what do you want more?
And then you ask me,

00:32:02.921 --> 00:32:11.054
“Mother, should I wink?” or whether, “Should I
smile?” This is too much!

00:32:11.733 --> 00:32:15.522
First of all you belittle yourself and
belittle me also.

00:32:15.722 --> 00:32:19.615
Behave in a confident manner,
in a proper way, and if I say

00:32:19.815 --> 00:32:23.456
anything, do not start going into
conclusions and things like that.

00:32:23.657 --> 00:32:27.100
Just understand that “Whatever Mother is
saying is not for me, for others, maybe.

00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:31.311
And if it is for me I should correct myself.”

00:32:31.511 --> 00:32:34.311
Simple thing! “If it is for
others, why should I worry?”

00:32:34.511 --> 00:32:37.590
“If it is for me, then thank Her very much and I

00:32:37.790 --> 00:32:41.372
must correct myself – finished!” It’s as
simple as that.

00:32:41.572 --> 00:32:45.493
A day should come when I don’t have to
talk, you have to talk.

00:32:45.693 --> 00:32:49.407
I should say so, that I should listen to all your wise
talks

00:32:49.607 --> 00:32:52.984
as I listen to children when they tell me something,
they are so wise; in

00:32:53.185 --> 00:32:56.905
the same way I would like to listen to
you people talking all wise things, nice

00:32:57.106 --> 00:32:59.199
things about each other, loving, not

00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:02.374
frightened of anyone, very happy with
each other, behaving like great

00:33:02.574 --> 00:33:06.437
gentlemen and great gentle-ladies, and

00:33:06.637 --> 00:33:10.668
being very much in love with each other,
looking after each other, not to be

00:33:10.868 --> 00:33:17.485
sullen and sulking and stupid faces, but
charming…

00:33:17.686 --> 00:33:19.913
’Charm’ I won’t use [that] word because
‘charming’ can be horrible, I have heard

00:33:20.114 --> 00:33:23.035
that before, I would say.

00:33:23.235 --> 00:33:27.067
But, faces that are lit up with joy, happiness and

00:33:27.107 --> 00:33:33.350
of giving; such people I want to see.
Such people should be there – loving,

00:33:33.550 --> 00:33:39.509
affectionate, good people, smiling.

00:33:39.710 --> 00:33:42.440
That should be so. That is what is Sahaja Yoga.

00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:47.390
Those who do not want to join in
are absolutely free to go out, actually

00:33:47.430 --> 00:33:49.725
they are thrown out.

00:33:49.925 --> 00:33:54.112
So, to stick on to Sahaja Yoga is
difficult. It is better to understand

00:33:54.312 --> 00:34:02.291
that to be a Sahaja Yogi is a difficult
thing, to be a non-Sahaja Yogi is the easiest.

00:34:04.134 --> 00:34:07.480
So, this is what you have been seeking,
which you have got, which you are.

00:34:07.590 --> 00:34:12.434
You should assume it. And be happy and
joyous and do not upset others, do not

00:34:12.634 --> 00:34:16.827
disturb others, don’t say harsh things

00:34:17.027 --> 00:34:21.561
because Nirmala Vidya stops at the left Vishuddhi.

00:34:21.761 --> 00:34:27.628
Be kind to others and
understand [that], if you need any correction,

00:34:27.828 --> 00:34:30.347
I am there to tell you. Up
to a point, I’ll tell, after some time,

00:34:30.547 --> 00:34:34.402
I’ll not say. Once the children are
grown up, Mother doesn’t say anything.

00:34:34.542 --> 00:34:38.834
She just sits down and watches the
beauty of Her children

00:34:39.035 --> 00:34:42.394
who are so grown up, so matured, so beautiful.

00:34:42.594 --> 00:34:45.167
I hope that time will come in my
lifetime

00:34:45.367 --> 00:34:48.308
and I will be able to see such
beautiful people around, that they are

00:34:48.508 --> 00:34:54.432
grown up, they understand how to behave,
and how to be nice and good.

00:34:54.632 --> 00:35:01.445
So, for today’s New Year, let us vow
within ourselves, that the selfishness

00:35:01.505 --> 00:35:05.655
or the self-centredness or the smallness
in you is finished.

00:35:05.856 --> 00:35:10.944
Now the drop has become the Ocean. Live like an ocean and like a lion.

00:35:11.144 --> 00:35:16.849
Don’t roar at others, I mean [be] generous
and don’t be afraid of anything.

00:35:17.050 --> 00:35:21.490
Everything is taken care of, but believe
that everything is taken care of.

00:35:21.691 --> 00:35:24.745
Sometimes you might feel you are let
down, sometimes you’ll feel,

00:35:24.945 --> 00:35:28.572
“Oh, this should have happened.” Do not desire for
anything!

00:35:28.773 --> 00:35:33.604
Whatever is your desire [is]
not correct, that’s all.

00:35:33.804 --> 00:35:40.757
If the desire is correct and is deserving, it will happen –

00:35:40.957 --> 00:35:45.163
hundred per cent [guaranteed]!

00:35:45.363 --> 00:35:49.449
So all the best, and the greatest
cheers, and happiness and joy.

00:35:49.649 --> 00:35:54.130
Feel your responsibility, understand
each other.

00:35:54.331 --> 00:36:01.035
And now I’m going. Tomorrow
I’ll be gone, so-called. (laughter)

00:36:04.766 --> 00:36:09.916
Don’t worry about anything else but
worry about the Sahaja Yoga that has to

00:36:09.977 --> 00:36:12.104
be established all over the world. 

00:36:12.490 --> 00:36:16.391
Very great work one has done.

00:36:16.591 --> 00:36:19.758
Of course, I mean, you can say that one has done as much one can do,

00:36:19.958 --> 00:36:23.670
but you can do much more.
You can become really dynamic and

00:36:23.710 --> 00:36:27.709
you can do it. Try to think of ways and
methods of doing it.

00:36:28.409 --> 00:36:32.892
"May God bless you all."

00:36:34.033 --> 00:36:38.333
So, now, with all these green and blues,

00:36:38.534 --> 00:36:44.012
should we start giving presents now? Who is going to give the presents?
