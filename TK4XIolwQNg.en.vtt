00:01:13.860 --> 00:03:16.750
So 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.800
the New Year is coming and CP.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:32.510
It's expected to be a very dynamic year for
Sahaja Yoga and Sahaja yogis.

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:40.040
Everything new becomes stale and never becomes
new again.

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.940
So whatever has gone has gone.

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.599
Let bygones be bygones.

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:56.560
There have been very sweet memories sometimes,
sometimes rather unhappy also, but on the

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.170
whole we are growing, realising, coming up.

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:10.520
You've done a good job of building up ourselves,
into a new way.

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:22.110
New Sahaja yogis have come up now have got
rid of their lethargy and their jealousies,

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:35.900
their slyness, their slumber and narrow-mindedness
. All these things have to be buried in the

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:36.900
past.

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.970
They are of no use to us.

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:43.909
It's a load we carry for nothing at all.

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:49.460
Today it happens that I read a very nice letter
which was lying with me which I didn't read.

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:53.580
It was sent by Gregoire to Warren.

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.419
It really touched my heart.

00:04:56.419 --> 00:05:04.970
He was concerned about the jealousies that
people suffer and the way he said that, that

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:13.430
this jealousy is the most petty stuff, a most
ugly thing, and it comes up as something as

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:22.560
a challenge to your love, challenge to your
understanding or something like that, and

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:28.300
then he started explaining it.

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.050
This explanation is all rational.

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:35.560
In Sahaja Yoga there is nothing like jealousy
. It doesn't exist.

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:42.300
It doesn't exist in the Kingdom of God, something
called jealousy, because all are part and

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.510
parcel of one God.

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:48.979
So, one person becomes important, another
less important.

00:05:48.979 --> 00:05:51.219
Is only for the time being.

00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:55.830
For example, when you are smelling a flower,
naturally the nose is more active than the

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:56.830
eyes.

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:00.880
When you are seeing the flower the eyes are
more active.

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:06.830
So, it is not necessary that at this moment,
when somebody is more active, doesn't mean

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:11.680
that he is closer to God and another person
who is inactive.

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:16.310
Everybody is, but some people are active at
a point, some people are active at another.

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:22.220
Or some people are closer, some people are
taken away but they are all part and parcel.

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:26.690
So this is one of the things one has to understand
that there should be no jealousy.

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:30.419
On the contrary, if you find somebody who
is spiritually higher you must try to understand

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:41.120
and appreciate, especially a person who is
wiser than somebody who says wise things.

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:47.349
If you hear somebody saying something wise,
try to notice, appreciate, enjoy, be nice.

00:06:47.349 --> 00:07:02.620
Sometimes even the children say something
nice.

00:07:02.620 --> 00:08:09.560
Young people can say something nice.

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:16.039
So the first thing is of jealousy which I
don't understand.

00:08:16.039 --> 00:08:21.039
Some of you think that I like someone more
than the other.

00:08:21.039 --> 00:08:24.440
To be very frank I have no idea of liking
or disliking.

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:25.729
I don't understand.

00:08:25.729 --> 00:08:28.279
There is no question.

00:08:28.279 --> 00:08:31.270
It's a very different mechanism you are dealing
with.

00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:36.650
That person who doesn't get involved into
any, doesn't get entangled into any.

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:40.479
Only thing what I am trying to do is to disentangle
you.

00:08:40.479 --> 00:08:44.330
If I was an entangling type, how can I disentangle?

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:53.300
You see, if I was the person who has to purify
you and if I am the person who cannot purify

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:58.670
you, then what's the use of My being there?

00:08:58.670 --> 00:09:02.170
So if the person who tries to purify has to
be pure himself.

00:09:02.170 --> 00:09:05.550
Supposing there's a soap and the soap is the
one that gets dirty.

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:09.250
Then what's the use of such a soap?

00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:12.220
In the same way I never get entangled with
anyone.

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:14.740
That's my name, Nirmama.

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:21.070
To Me, Nirmala, nobody is mine.

00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:22.070
Everybody.

00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:35.770
So this should get out of your mind as 

00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:42.220
to Nirmala.

00:09:42.220 --> 00:10:08.870
All right, so we have to bury this useless
thing called jealousy and it can be very serious.

00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:11.040
It can happen very serious with people.

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:13.160
I have seen people, they got jealous.

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:16.000
Then they've got after another person.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:22.529
Then they've got after Sahaja Yoga, then after.

00:10:22.529 --> 00:10:26.360
And this jealousy, one should not allow to
crawl in.

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:33.819
You see, some people are more congenial, sometimes
are more nearer Sahaja yoga, sometimes.

00:10:33.819 --> 00:10:35.579
They are more helpful.

00:10:35.579 --> 00:10:37.040
Sometimes they are more useful.

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:39.310
Sometimes they have to be there.

00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:41.090
Sometimes they need Me the most of all.

00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:42.410
Some of them are lost people.

00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:45.290
Some of them are really possessed and badly
off.

00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:48.070
So sometimes that's why I look after them.

00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:50.180
It's My own whim.

00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:51.180
I cannot say.

00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:52.180
I cannot justify.

00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:53.870
Maybe that person is very good.

00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:54.870
I look after.

00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:58.209
Maybe that person is very bad.

00:10:58.209 --> 00:11:00.690
I look after.

00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:05.140
So one should never have any jealousy with
people.

00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:11.779
Only you must have understanding that your
Mother has to work for all of you and has

00:11:11.779 --> 00:11:16.770
to improve you, cure you, do something about.

00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:22.029
One thing we have to bury is the jealousy
that lives within us.

00:11:22.029 --> 00:11:27.269
We bury something and something comes out
very bad, and what is that comes out of this

00:11:27.269 --> 00:11:32.949
jealousy, is that we have to better ourselves.

00:11:32.949 --> 00:11:37.819
So the outgoing jealousy should leave within
us.

00:11:37.819 --> 00:11:40.459
"Oh, am I jealous of a person!"

00:11:40.459 --> 00:11:42.560
Then what's good in that person?

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:46.259
Now, this is not outward.

00:11:46.259 --> 00:11:48.010
Sahaja is not outward.

00:11:48.010 --> 00:11:53.399
If that person is outwardly like this, outwardly,
it goes inward.

00:11:53.399 --> 00:12:01.709
If I correct somebody, I correct that person
because the vibrations of that person are

00:12:01.709 --> 00:12:03.660
not all right.

00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:08.050
You see that person can be extremely sweet
also, a very sweet type, could be anything,

00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:14.399
could be harsh, could be anything, but the
vibrations of that person have to be all right.

00:12:14.399 --> 00:12:19.550
I have to gain nothing out of you except that
your vibrations should be correct.

00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:25.870
So, you should not have any misidentification
that some people are very dynamic, so they

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:28.129
think they can do what they like.

00:12:28.129 --> 00:12:34.370
Some people think they are very sort of deceiving
type so they think they can do what they like.

00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:35.690
All of this.

00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:50.399
First of all you should speak collective.

00:12:50.399 --> 00:12:55.560
For a mother if some children are left behind,
her heart, all the time she thinks they are

00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:56.560
left behind.

00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:57.560
They should.

00:12:57.560 --> 00:12:58.589
That's the main thing.

00:12:58.589 --> 00:13:00.860
This is not for one person.

00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:05.470
Like just thinking about your own son or thinking
about your own wife, thinking about your own

00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:06.470
husband.

00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:07.470
It's not the point.

00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:16.019
All of you are dearer to Me, dearest to Me,
but I belong to no one.

00:13:16.019 --> 00:13:17.300
I'm a hopeless case.

00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:19.140
Just hear me up.

00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:21.440
I belong to no one.

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:22.810
No one can possess me.

00:13:22.810 --> 00:13:24.380
I cannot possess myself.

00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:27.480
How can you possess?

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:31.570
I am beyond possession.

00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:33.670
Then if it is so, there should be no jealousy.

00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:38.980
There's no question of jealousy or in any
way feeling jealous of each other.

00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:42.940
Only the beauty of enjoying others.

00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:47.459
Somebody has some great points - very good
qualities in that person - you'll imbibe it.

00:13:47.459 --> 00:13:50.060
In Sahaja Yoga, whatever you enjoy you imbibe.

00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:55.089
You know that.

00:13:55.089 --> 00:13:57.240
Whatever you enjoy you will imbibe, just like
that.

00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:59.569
You should be able to enjoy.

00:13:59.569 --> 00:14:05.110
Now supposing you enjoy creating rifts in
people, creating problems with people, you'll

00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:06.400
have them yourself.

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:13.889
Supposing you enjoy saying harsh things to
others, you'll imbibe that in the sense that

00:14:13.889 --> 00:14:15.240
you will have more of it.

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:18.040
Whatever you want, you will have.

00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:21.399
Christ has said if you want gold, you'll have
gold.

00:14:21.399 --> 00:14:26.430
Many people who came to Sahaja Yoga went away
in the search of money, promotions and they

00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:27.430
got it.

00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:28.759
You'll have gold.

00:14:28.759 --> 00:14:36.019
But those who are dearer to Me, will have,
will sit with Me on My throne.

00:14:36.019 --> 00:14:39.100
This is what you should ask for.

00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:41.829
This is what you ask for.

00:14:41.829 --> 00:14:48.500
Not for having more gold, more money, more
this, more that, but that you are part and

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:52.860
parcel of his company.

00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:58.399
Now somehow, I know everyone of you.

00:14:58.399 --> 00:15:05.120
Somehow, I don't know how, I know everyone
of you.

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:06.949
How far you are with me, I know.

00:15:06.949 --> 00:15:10.630
There is no need to justify.

00:15:10.630 --> 00:15:12.199
No need to say, "This is not so.

00:15:12.199 --> 00:15:13.199
That is not so".

00:15:13.199 --> 00:15:15.879
I know everything.

00:15:15.879 --> 00:15:16.879
I should know.

00:15:16.879 --> 00:15:22.730
Otherwise, how would I give you something
substantial?

00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:29.950
I have to give you something very special
and for that I have to know what you need,

00:15:29.950 --> 00:15:34.079
when I know I love you.

00:15:34.079 --> 00:15:39.070
Unless until you love someone, you cannot
know so much about the person.

00:15:39.070 --> 00:15:40.370
I know your beauties.

00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:43.660
I also know your ugliness.

00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:46.139
I know your tenderness.

00:15:46.139 --> 00:15:47.610
I know your harshness.

00:15:47.610 --> 00:15:53.879
I know all the things that you have, that
you have been, that you are, and you will

00:15:53.879 --> 00:15:55.519
be.

00:15:55.519 --> 00:15:59.850
It is many-dimensional knowledge.

00:15:59.850 --> 00:16:07.569
Some of you I expect it is too much because
I think you are capable and I know your past.

00:16:07.569 --> 00:16:08.871
I work very hard on you.

00:16:08.871 --> 00:16:16.149
You know that and I'll work and I'll continue
to work, every year, but '82 is a very remarkable

00:16:16.149 --> 00:16:20.749
year, where you people should now work hard
for Sahaja Yoga.

00:16:20.749 --> 00:16:23.910
I have already given some idea as to how to
work it with Raveen.

00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:25.509
I have talked to him.

00:16:25.509 --> 00:16:31.399
Raveen knows how we are going to work it out
in a systematic way, how to attack a particular

00:16:31.399 --> 00:16:37.250
village, or a particular district, or wherever
you have to go, how to go there, how to propagate,

00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:39.850
how to establish.

00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:43.730
Wherever there is soft ground you should settle
down, not in the hard ground.

00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:47.870
The hard ground will never yield any produce.

00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:49.749
So don't go on working on a hard ground.

00:16:49.749 --> 00:16:52.579
Put your attention to these factors.

00:16:52.579 --> 00:16:54.470
What can I do for Sahaja Yoga?

00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:56.240
Take out your attention from yourself.

00:16:56.240 --> 00:17:02.069
For example, supposing a person, now there
are presents all being tied up.

00:17:02.069 --> 00:17:05.530
Supposing a person wanted a particular present,
take it like that.

00:17:05.530 --> 00:17:09.920
Sahaja Yogis are not that low type but still,
supposing take the lowest of lowest, behave

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:11.100
like children.

00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:14.160
So, you don't get that particular one.

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:20.640
Now, to do all this with all the work I've
been doing here, select that and to arrange

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:24.199
all that, isn't it tremendous?

00:17:24.199 --> 00:17:28.400
So, whatever Mother could do in that hurry
and scurry, with everybody's name and all

00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:34.270
that, it is quite a lot to be done, and if
She has done that, one should appreciate the

00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:36.870
love that Mother wants to bestow upon you.

00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:39.140
It is all symbolic.

00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:42.360
But somebody can sit down and start saying,
"Oh, I should have had this.

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:43.530
Why didn't you give me this?

00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:44.530
Why didn't you give me that.

00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:45.530
I should have."

00:17:45.530 --> 00:17:50.960
You see, it is not anything that one has made
or anything, just to give somebody something,

00:17:50.960 --> 00:18:00.350
in a small way, I am saying, but even in this
small way, you are worried about yourself.

00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:03.150
You have to worry about Sahaja Yoga.

00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:04.310
What's going to happen to Sahaja Yoga?

00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:05.910
How is it going to come up?

00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:07.340
What have you to work it out?

00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:08.340
What do you have to do?

00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:09.640
How many pujas do we have to arrange?

00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:11.800
How do we have to do anything?

00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:12.800
Not about yourself.

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:13.940
How should I improve myself?

00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:15.480
That point is also.

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:16.510
Forget it.

00:18:16.510 --> 00:18:21.080
What are we going to do to propagate Sahaja
Yoga, we have to say.

00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:25.570
Not go to personal life, my husband and wife
quarrelling, with them.

00:18:25.570 --> 00:18:26.570
I mean, I've had enough of it.

00:18:26.570 --> 00:18:30.460
I mean, I'm not here to settle your marriages.

00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:34.350
All these nonsensical things, you forget now.

00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:37.929
Of course, if you have a good marriage, it
helps Sahaja Yoga, no doubt.

00:18:37.929 --> 00:18:40.170
It helps because you get children.

00:18:40.170 --> 00:18:41.170
It helps.

00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:44.309
If the husband and wife are not all right,
you might get very horrible children which

00:18:44.309 --> 00:18:46.880
may be possessed from the very childhood and
be very difficult.

00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:52.820
They will be realised souls but will be very
difficult children.

00:18:52.820 --> 00:19:00.929
So this is important that we should dedicate
ourselves to Sahaja Yoga today, to bring out

00:19:00.929 --> 00:19:09.250
the old and bring out the new which is dedicated
to Sahaja Yoga - not to your personal life,

00:19:09.250 --> 00:19:16.029
not your personal likes and dislikes, what
will happen to Sahaja Yoga - and to be sincere

00:19:16.029 --> 00:19:17.210
about it.

00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:20.169
Many people who organise go off their heads.

00:19:20.169 --> 00:19:21.679
I've seen it.

00:19:21.679 --> 00:19:27.800
Somehow, you give them something to organise,
they are about to land up in a lunatic asylum.

00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:35.350
You give them something to organise, make
them the leader, finished.

00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:36.350
It happens like that.

00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:38.039
It goes off their head somehow or other.

00:19:38.039 --> 00:19:55.330
You see, there is a crack in the head, and
these, so the cracked head then starts behaving

00:19:55.330 --> 00:20:00.270
in such a funny manner, that you can't imagine
how far one can go.

00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:05.810
You have to organise, you have to become right-sided,
you have to work hard, no doubt, but you need

00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:07.740
not be right-sided.

00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:12.049
If you work with right hand you don't become
right-sided, do you?

00:20:12.049 --> 00:20:15.710
You don't double up your ears, nose or (mantra?).

00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:17.169
Do we?

00:20:17.169 --> 00:20:19.350
Or you don't.

00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:24.881
I mean, really, the nature, it keeps the body
all right, I must say, because there is some

00:20:24.881 --> 00:20:26.539
right-handed people should have a right side,
emotions.

00:20:26.539 --> 00:20:28.570
Or the left hand should have a left-hand development.

00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:32.850
Should be there, but it is not.

00:20:32.850 --> 00:20:34.450
It keeps nature all right.

00:20:34.450 --> 00:20:38.240
Nature keeps the faith all right, everything
all right.

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:39.510
It keeps it.

00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:50.399
So one has to know that when you are trying
to bring in something new, you must talk of

00:20:50.399 --> 00:20:51.620
the new.

00:20:51.620 --> 00:20:57.000
Then whatever is old and outward should be
sent away, should be thrown out.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.450
Otherwise you will never grow.

00:20:58.450 --> 00:21:11.059
It will shift from here to here, here to here,
the bhoot particles.

00:21:11.059 --> 00:21:16.280
So today's message of not feeling guilty and
not thinking of what all old things, old rags

00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:20.520
you have had on, throw it away, same day.

00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:22.640
You see, obstinacy should not be there.

00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:23.640
People are very obstinate.

00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:24.640
They don't want to see.

00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:25.640
They don't want to forget.

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:26.640
They don't want to forgive.

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:28.331
Give up that obstinacy.

00:21:28.331 --> 00:21:31.330
Obstinacy is not the nature of your spirit.

00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:34.500
If you are the spirit you will never be obstinate.

00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:36.539
Have you ever seen Me being obstinate?

00:21:36.539 --> 00:21:37.539
Ever?

00:21:37.539 --> 00:21:38.760
You said, "Mother, sit here."

00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:39.760
"All right".

00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:40.760
You say, "Sit there."

00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:41.760
"All right".

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:45.870
No, not that I am going to sit here alone.

00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:46.950
Never, never.

00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:50.220
You say, "Mother, will you eat this?"

00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:54.580
"All right," even if I am very, very full
myself.

00:21:54.580 --> 00:22:01.580
Sometimes I should put down My foot but I
don't.

00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:07.059
So you should also not be at all obstinate.

00:22:07.059 --> 00:22:08.529
There should be not obstinacy.

00:22:08.529 --> 00:22:10.000
There should be no fanatics.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.850
It's all a play going on, this way, that way,
that way.

00:22:14.850 --> 00:22:18.120
Just enjoy yourself.

00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:22.039
So this is one thing, if you are obstinate,
you cannot become a new person.

00:22:22.039 --> 00:22:27.980
To become a new person you have to give up
your obstinacy completely.

00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:33.059
Once you give up your obstinacy you will be
very happy and peaceful, and you must come

00:22:33.059 --> 00:22:46.610
as a new person every minute, every second
you are.

00:22:46.610 --> 00:22:55.820
So I just.

00:22:55.820 --> 00:23:09.269
Now, as far as Sahaja Yoga is concerned in
England, I think it has taken a good road.

00:23:09.269 --> 00:23:12.179
Propagation has to be established.

00:23:12.179 --> 00:23:13.549
It has to be publicised.

00:23:13.549 --> 00:23:15.299
It has to be talked about.

00:23:15.299 --> 00:23:17.320
People are to be told you have found it.

00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:20.590
Go and see people who are seekers.

00:23:20.590 --> 00:23:28.090
Whatever level you are, supposing you are
dealing with a particular type, of say a lawyer,

00:23:28.090 --> 00:23:29.890
should meet all the lawyers.

00:23:29.890 --> 00:23:34.559
If there's a psychologist is there, should
go and see the psychologist.

00:23:34.559 --> 00:23:38.409
At your level, whatever level it is, you should
go and talk about it to others that this is

00:23:38.409 --> 00:23:40.029
what you have found out.

00:23:40.029 --> 00:23:46.620
Why don't you get hold of it, and you will
all get good quality people who are really

00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:47.620
seekers?

00:23:47.620 --> 00:23:50.370
You must talk now and that is what is.

00:23:50.370 --> 00:23:52.769
Get out of your shyness.

00:23:52.769 --> 00:23:55.720
That is very important to get out of your
shyness.

00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:57.610
Talk to people.

00:23:57.610 --> 00:24:03.230
But I've seen people when they talk about
Sahaja Yoga, instead of giving a good name

00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:08.779
to Sahaja Yoga, they bring bad name, because
when they talk, they talk in such a way as

00:24:08.779 --> 00:24:10.409
if they are being clever.

00:24:10.409 --> 00:24:11.409
That's not good.

00:24:11.409 --> 00:24:13.360
We have to say we are just the same.

00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:18.980
We are just the old egg and we are just trying
to talk because we have found something, so

00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:20.580
others are not hurt.

00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:25.399
So for that you have to remember the past
that we were like this, and if somebody had

00:24:25.399 --> 00:24:27.710
talked to us, like this, they would have been
hurt.

00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:33.570
We have to remember our past, remembering
the past, just for your own manoeuvring, that's

00:24:33.570 --> 00:24:34.570
all.

00:24:34.570 --> 00:24:39.210
Not that as a part and parcel but just for
your manoeuvring, how to deal with others.

00:24:39.210 --> 00:24:43.040
Unless until you remember your past, you will
not know how to deal with others and you won't

00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:47.600
have compassion.

00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:52.470
So that is what we have to see, the importance
of the past.

00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:58.620
The future at this present moment is that
'82 is a great year, that's all, not more

00:24:58.620 --> 00:24:59.620
than that.

00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:04.019
You don't have to think about '83 because
even if you start doing it in '83,'82 will

00:25:04.019 --> 00:25:05.019
be silent.

00:25:05.019 --> 00:25:06.620
"You do it in '83, Mother.

00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:07.960
What does it mean?

00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:14.600
I think I believe it would be a better idea
to do this in '83.

00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:17.080
What do you think, Mother?"

00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:18.080
Suggestions.

00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:21.610
I have a suggestion today.

00:25:21.610 --> 00:25:29.130
Supposing we do it in '83, why not today?

00:25:29.130 --> 00:25:31.090
Why not now?

00:25:31.090 --> 00:25:33.890
Ask the question, "Why not?"

00:25:33.890 --> 00:25:38.480
When such a thing is done, why not now?

00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:45.830
And then whatever you do, you do it fully,
completely to the finishing point.

00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:49.649
Like (Pais ?) has been very good with you
when we were working in that house.

00:25:49.649 --> 00:25:53.630
You were chiselling the house and I was chiselling
you.

00:25:53.630 --> 00:25:56.340
You were building the house and I was building
you.

00:25:56.340 --> 00:26:00.230
It was very good, interesting, very nice.

00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:02.399
Some of you have really gained a lot, really
gained a lot.

00:26:02.399 --> 00:26:05.850
You have really become very dynamic, very
beautiful, very Sahaja.

00:26:05.850 --> 00:26:08.850
Quite a lot of you done that.

00:26:08.850 --> 00:26:15.340
I know that and it is really very appreciative,
work that you have done.

00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:17.320
Anybody can see that very clearly.

00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:21.770
You are being described by Blake that you
will be the golden builders.

00:26:21.770 --> 00:26:30.990
Clearly, this is done by the golden bridges,
but in that you have to learn first.

00:26:30.990 --> 00:26:33.679
Like now they are painting, all right.

00:26:33.679 --> 00:26:34.940
The painter goes up to paint.

00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:37.639
He takes a place to sit down on top.

00:26:37.639 --> 00:26:44.210
When he comes out everything is there, all
the mismanagement that was done is still there.

00:26:44.210 --> 00:26:45.690
The painter has finished the painting.

00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:50.799
Still the scaffolding is there, the seat is
there, the things on which he was sitting,

00:26:50.799 --> 00:26:55.660
the cushion is there, all these piers that
were removed that are there, all the carpets

00:26:55.660 --> 00:26:58.299
are there, are just the same.

00:26:58.299 --> 00:27:05.470
It takes hardly ten minutes to put it right.

00:27:05.470 --> 00:27:09.910
So this is the future.

00:27:09.910 --> 00:27:17.990
The future is that when you do something,
feel, be that futuristic seed of that person.

00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:20.899
See that the state in the seed again.

00:27:20.899 --> 00:27:21.899
You give realisation to somebody.

00:27:21.899 --> 00:27:22.899
See that it is fixed.

00:27:22.899 --> 00:27:28.429
So remember the past for your manoeuvring
and remember the future for feeling so it

00:27:28.429 --> 00:27:30.240
is not lost in the future.

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:38.850
This is importance of making the spirit.

00:27:38.850 --> 00:27:42.850
Experience of the back or the past should
give you manoeuvring, in the sense that at

00:27:42.850 --> 00:27:47.400
that moment you must do something in the present.

00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:52.720
You must compensate, in the sense that at
that moment you must do something in the present.

00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:56.740
You must compensate, in the sense that at
that moment you must do something by which

00:27:56.740 --> 00:28:01.809
the future is not giving.

00:28:01.809 --> 00:28:09.049
This is how New Year's celebration should
be.

00:28:09.049 --> 00:28:11.419
'82 is important.

00:28:11.419 --> 00:28:15.330
In '82 whatever we have learned from the past,
we remember.

00:28:15.330 --> 00:28:17.940
We'll not do the same mistake.

00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:21.980
Not only but also, remember whatever past
has taught us.

00:28:21.980 --> 00:28:26.220
We'll have compassion for the people who have
been like that.

00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:27.600
We'll have love for them.

00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:28.630
We'll have understanding.

00:28:28.630 --> 00:28:31.600
We'll do whatever is possible to bring them
round.

00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:36.399
We'll have concern, need not just Sahaja Yogis,
you see, sweet-talking Sahaja Yogis, but we'll

00:28:36.399 --> 00:28:40.360
do something about it.

00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:43.330
So many are lost in intellectual pursuits.

00:28:43.330 --> 00:28:46.929
So many are lost in financial pursuits.

00:28:46.929 --> 00:28:52.900
So many are lost in political pursuits and
so many are lost in so-called service pursuits.

00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:58.019
All of them belong to some category and you
have to belong to one of these categories.

00:28:58.019 --> 00:29:02.770
So you have to think of them, try to bring
them out, do something about it, have a wider

00:29:02.770 --> 00:29:04.100
standing.

00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:09.991
When you have a small personalty, think of
your wife, yourself, nothing more than that

00:29:09.991 --> 00:29:12.210
or your children at the most.

00:29:12.210 --> 00:29:17.620
But when you are a wider personality you just
think what will happen to the people who belong

00:29:17.620 --> 00:29:23.840
to this clan, who belong to Catholicism, those
who belong to Judaism, those who belong to

00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:25.399
Methodist and to Jainism.

00:29:25.399 --> 00:29:31.360
Saint Michael, like that, have a wider personality.

00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:37.150
Don't worry about yourself.

00:29:37.150 --> 00:29:40.519
I've known people who'll come and ask, "Mother,
where should I find my keys?

00:29:40.519 --> 00:29:43.690
Mother, where should I put my basket?

00:29:43.690 --> 00:29:52.000
Mother, where should I put my nose?

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.990
What should I do about my luggage?

00:29:53.990 --> 00:29:56.860
What should I do about my travelling?"

00:29:56.860 --> 00:29:59.190
All nonsensical things, they'll come and ask.

00:29:59.190 --> 00:30:01.380
I'm not here to give you all that.

00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:03.500
Every small thing they will ask.

00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:05.759
Now if you tell them, "Why are you doing it?"

00:30:05.759 --> 00:30:06.759
you said it.

00:30:06.759 --> 00:30:10.279
I didn't say it that you ask Me every time
you have to raise a finger.

00:30:10.279 --> 00:30:11.870
"Mother, may I rise my finger.

00:30:11.870 --> 00:30:13.340
May I close my eyes?

00:30:13.340 --> 00:30:14.340
May I smile?"

00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:18.650
Not that.

00:30:18.650 --> 00:30:21.520
You are people, in My eyes are saints.

00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:25.649
So decide for yourself, of course.

00:30:25.649 --> 00:30:27.710
You are saints.

00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:30.470
You have to assume.

00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:31.910
You don't know you are saints.

00:30:31.910 --> 00:30:32.910
Assume you are saints.

00:30:32.910 --> 00:30:37.070
This assumption must come to you, on this
great auspicious day that you are saints,

00:30:37.070 --> 00:30:43.850
and saints have to be wise people and do it
by themselves, because they are saints.

00:30:43.850 --> 00:30:49.740
If they fight, quarrel among themselves, then
this is stupidity, absolute stupidity, against

00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:50.740
the whole.

00:30:50.740 --> 00:30:53.690
Sahaja Yoga is here to solve the problems
of others.

00:30:53.690 --> 00:30:58.679
What am I to tell you anything?

00:30:58.679 --> 00:31:00.039
You are saints, that's all I say, care.

00:31:00.039 --> 00:31:02.720
If you ask Me any questions, answer is you
are saints.

00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:04.380
Do what you like.

00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:05.429
Whatever you want you will have.

00:31:05.429 --> 00:31:07.289
Whatever you say it will happen.

00:31:07.289 --> 00:31:09.399
Whatever you ask for it will happen.

00:31:09.399 --> 00:31:13.820
Whatever you imagine it will work out, but
if you imagine something good and say something

00:31:13.820 --> 00:31:19.519
good and do something that is divine, you
are so great.

00:31:19.519 --> 00:31:25.059
You are made like that.

00:31:25.059 --> 00:31:26.210
You are that.

00:31:26.210 --> 00:31:27.210
Assume.

00:31:27.210 --> 00:31:29.790
Assume that power that you are a saint.

00:31:29.790 --> 00:31:32.210
How can you say something nonsensical?

00:31:32.210 --> 00:31:46.429
Nirmala Vidya is at your disposal, at your
complete, I would say, in fact, Nirmala Vidya,

00:31:46.429 --> 00:31:49.169
nobody had it except for you Sahaja Yogis
have.

00:31:49.169 --> 00:31:52.549
Nobody had even the, Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh,
never even had it.

00:31:52.549 --> 00:31:53.549
Can you believe?

00:31:53.549 --> 00:32:02.309
They had their own powers but you have Nirmala
Vidya and now what do you want more and then

00:32:02.309 --> 00:32:07.159
you ask me, "Mother, should I ring?" or whether,
"Should I smile?"

00:32:07.159 --> 00:32:08.159
This is (?).

00:32:08.159 --> 00:32:15.210
First of all you believe in yourself and then
it will work out.

00:32:15.210 --> 00:32:21.690
Behave in a confident manner, in a proper
way, and if I say anything, do not start going

00:32:21.690 --> 00:32:24.309
into confusion, something like that.

00:32:24.309 --> 00:32:30.100
Just understand that what your Mother is saying
is not for Me, for others, maybe, and if it

00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:31.790
is for Me I should correct Myself.

00:32:31.790 --> 00:32:32.790
Simple thing.

00:32:32.790 --> 00:32:34.549
If it is for others, why should I worry?

00:32:34.549 --> 00:32:38.790
If it is for Me, thank them very much and
I must correct Myself.

00:32:38.790 --> 00:32:39.810
It's as simple as that.

00:32:39.810 --> 00:32:45.000
A day should come when I don't have to talk.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.120
You have to talk.

00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:51.360
I hope that I could listen to all your wise
talk as I listen to children when they tell

00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:52.360
me something.

00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:53.812
As I listen to children when they tell me
something.

00:32:53.812 --> 00:32:54.812
They are so wise.

00:32:54.812 --> 00:32:57.679
In the same way I would like to listen to
you, talking all wise things, nice things,

00:32:57.679 --> 00:33:02.919
about each other, loving, not frightened of
anyone, very happy, with each other behaving

00:33:02.919 --> 00:33:09.549
like great gentlemen and great gentle ladies,
and be very much in love with each other,

00:33:09.549 --> 00:33:16.980
looking after each other, not to be sullen
and sulking and stupid faces, but charming.

00:33:16.980 --> 00:33:17.980
Charm!

00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:19.909
I won't use the word because charming can
be horrible.

00:33:19.909 --> 00:33:28.220
I've heard that because I would say, but faces
that are lit up with joy, happiness and of

00:33:28.220 --> 00:33:29.220
dignity.

00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:42.020
Such people should be like (?). Loving, affectionate,
smiling, that should be that is what is Sahaja

00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:43.020
Yoga.

00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:46.830
Those who do not want to join are absolutely
(unclear: (to God?).

00:33:46.830 --> 00:33:49.669
Actually, they are thrown out.

00:33:49.669 --> 00:33:51.970
So, to stick onto Sahaja Yoga is difficult.

00:33:51.970 --> 00:33:56.350
It is better to understand that to be a Sahaja
Yoga is difficult thing.

00:33:56.350 --> 00:34:04.159
To be a non Sahaja yogi is to exist.

00:34:04.159 --> 00:34:09.480
So this is what you have been seeking, which
you've got, which you assume, and be happy

00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:14.140
and joyous and do not upset others.

00:34:14.140 --> 00:34:15.419
Do not disturb others.

00:34:15.419 --> 00:34:25.601
Don't say harsh things because Nirmala will
get upset ( ?). Be kind to others and understand.

00:34:25.601 --> 00:34:29.470
If you need any correction I am there to tell
you.

00:34:29.470 --> 00:34:30.810
Up to a point I will tell you.

00:34:30.810 --> 00:34:31.880
After some time, I'll not.

00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:34.510
Once the children are grown up Mother doesn't
say anything.

00:34:34.510 --> 00:34:41.440
She just sits down and watches the beauty
of her children who are so grown up, so mature,

00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:42.650
so beautiful.

00:34:42.650 --> 00:34:47.710
I hope that time will come in my lifetime
and I will be able to see such beautiful people

00:34:47.710 --> 00:34:54.649
around, that they have grown up, they understand
how to behave, and how to be nice and good.

00:34:54.649 --> 00:35:03.250
So for today's New Year let us vow within
ourselves that the selfishness or the self-centeredness

00:35:03.250 --> 00:35:05.500
of the smallest in you is finished.

00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:07.900
Now the drop has to become the ocean.

00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:11.400
Live like an ocean and like a lion.

00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:17.580
Don't roar at others and be generous and don't
be afraid of others.

00:35:17.580 --> 00:35:22.190
Everything is taken care of, but believe that
everything is taken care of.

00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:25.840
Sometimes you might feel that you are let
down, or you might feel that this should have

00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:26.840
happened.

00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:28.470
Do not desire for it.

00:35:28.470 --> 00:35:33.010
Whatever you desire is not correct, that's
all.

00:35:33.010 --> 00:35:42.830
If the desire is correct and it's deserving
it will happen - one hundred per cent.

00:35:42.830 --> 00:35:46.120
So all the best.

00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:49.330
Have the greatest year, and happiness and
joy.

00:35:49.330 --> 00:35:51.850
Do your responsibilities.

00:35:51.850 --> 00:35:54.520
Understand each other.

00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:55.560
And now I'm going.

00:35:55.560 --> 00:36:04.960
Tomorrow I will be gone, so-called.

00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:08.690
Don't worry about anything else but worry
about Sahaja Yoga.

00:36:08.690 --> 00:36:11.410
That has to be established all over the world.

00:36:11.410 --> 00:36:15.440
Very great work one has done, of course.

00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:21.200
I mean, you can't say, one has done as much
one can do, but you can do much more.

00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:59.330
You can become really dynamic 

00:36:59.330 --> 00:37:52.100
and 

00:37:52.100 --> 00:39:40.900
you can 

00:39:40.900 --> 00:40:07.100
do it.

00:40:07.100 --> 00:40:43.640
Try to 

00:40:43.640 --> 00:41:24.500
think of ways and methods of doing it.

00:41:24.500 --> 00:42:19.660
May God bless you.

00:42:19.660 --> 00:47:56.180
So now with all these dreams and blues, should
we start giving presents now.
