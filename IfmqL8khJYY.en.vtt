00:02:49.419 --> 00:03:02.469
Today is the first day, New Year's Day, according
to the Shalivahana Calendar, who were My forefathers.

00:03:02.469 --> 00:03:10.599
And in the whole of Maharashtra, it is regarded
as the New Year Day and the best day to start

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:13.679
anything.

00:03:13.679 --> 00:03:20.419
So today I've decided to have Mahamaya Puja.

00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:33.329
I have never talked about Mahamaya, as it
is not to be talked or told - it's a secret,

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:37.489
as they say.

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:47.999
It's the basic of Sahaja Yoga, I should say,
because it's described, when the Goddess comes

00:03:47.999 --> 00:03:56.959
in the Sahasrara, the Shakti, She is Mahamaya
- "Sahasrare Mahamaya," already described.

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:05.999
She has to be the Mahamaya, means She should
camouflage Herself fully.

00:04:05.999 --> 00:04:16.149
Nobody should be able to know Her as the Goddess,
to begin with; and even if they get Realization,

00:04:16.149 --> 00:04:23.498
they should not reach to the end of it.

00:04:23.498 --> 00:04:25.859
There are many reasons for that.

00:04:25.859 --> 00:04:28.301
The first thing: the job.

00:04:28.301 --> 00:04:32.089
The job of Mahamaya was to give Realization.

00:04:32.089 --> 00:04:40.299
Now, if I had come on a tiger with a sword
in My hand, nobody would have stood near Me.

00:04:40.299 --> 00:04:44.809
You all would have run away from Me.

00:04:44.809 --> 00:04:52.729
In any other form, if the Goddess had come,
She could not have done what She was supposed

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:53.919
to do.

00:04:53.919 --> 00:05:02.798
Moreover, only if She had come as the Mother
of Christ, or Shri Sitaji, or you can say

00:05:02.798 --> 00:05:06.419
Fatima - they all ended their lives.

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:13.478
They had to go away from this world so early,
I mean.

00:05:13.478 --> 00:05:16.469
They couldn't do any work whatsoever.

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:24.279
Now this work, difficult work of giving Realization
to others, is very intricate.

00:05:24.279 --> 00:05:33.808
It has to work out in such a manner that nobody
feels that it is done by some great personality

00:05:33.808 --> 00:05:39.258
or with a great awe or fear.

00:05:39.258 --> 00:05:46.588
So the Mahamaya Incarnation has to come, that
people can come closer.

00:05:46.588 --> 00:05:59.788
Also, it has one advantage, very great advantages,
that when a simple person who's just a housewife

00:05:59.788 --> 00:06:05.148
starts giving Realization, people are flabbergasted.

00:06:05.148 --> 00:06:09.228
Also they think, "If She can do it, why not
we do it?

00:06:09.228 --> 00:06:12.408
After all, She's just an ordinary housewife.

00:06:12.408 --> 00:06:14.228
So, it's all right.

00:06:14.228 --> 00:06:16.938
If She can do something, we can also do it."

00:06:16.938 --> 00:06:26.688
So they have self-confidence, you see, and,
being a Mother, She does Her loving part,

00:06:26.688 --> 00:06:30.419
Her compassion, but the greatest is the patience.

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:36.329
You see, none of them had so much patience,
all these Incarnations who came.

00:06:36.329 --> 00:06:43.588
You see how they disappeared from this Mother
Earth quickly, I'd say, by some excuse or

00:06:43.588 --> 00:06:44.588
other.

00:06:44.588 --> 00:06:52.478
But I had to stay, I don't know how long,
but it has to be done up to a point, this

00:06:52.478 --> 00:06:54.518
work of giving Realization.

00:06:54.518 --> 00:07:07.609
The third thing was that you have to be identified
into My Body, into My cells of My Body, but

00:07:07.609 --> 00:07:16.769
this is a more difficult task because supposing
one of you becomes stupid, becomes foolish,

00:07:16.769 --> 00:07:18.299
quarrelsome.

00:07:18.299 --> 00:07:23.039
Anything you do, any small thing, it hurts
Me.

00:07:23.039 --> 00:07:26.139
It has to, but I don't think about Myself.

00:07:26.139 --> 00:07:28.489
I always think about you.

00:07:28.489 --> 00:07:33.028
So it's an indication to Me that something
has gone wrong somewhere.

00:07:33.028 --> 00:07:35.789
Somebody is doing something wrong to somebody.

00:07:35.789 --> 00:07:38.709
Some Sahaja Yogis are being tortured.

00:07:38.709 --> 00:07:40.558
Some are sick.

00:07:40.558 --> 00:07:45.878
Anything like that, I work it out very intensely
and intimately.

00:07:45.878 --> 00:07:51.919
Recently, today only, they told Me somebody
has got meningitis in Australia.

00:07:51.919 --> 00:07:54.479
Immediately, I gave bandhan.

00:07:54.479 --> 00:08:02.709
I'm sure such a person should be cured if
she has any faith in Me and she's in My being.

00:08:02.709 --> 00:08:07.419
Or somebody is ill somewhere, they tell Me
and such a person is saved.

00:08:07.419 --> 00:08:08.989
They call it a miracle.

00:08:08.989 --> 00:08:11.938
It is not a miracle.

00:08:11.938 --> 00:08:14.549
It's not a miracle.

00:08:14.549 --> 00:08:17.979
It's again the Mahamaya's blessings are like
this.

00:08:17.979 --> 00:08:20.329
You can't see how you are inside Me.

00:08:20.329 --> 00:08:22.259
You can't see your reflection within Me.

00:08:22.259 --> 00:08:23.259
You can't see.

00:08:23.259 --> 00:08:24.658
This is Mahamaya.

00:08:24.658 --> 00:08:30.509
This is the secret part of it, that you don't
know; and then when I feel the pain and if

00:08:30.509 --> 00:08:35.829
I try, look at it, because I have power to
cures, so you get cured.

00:08:35.829 --> 00:08:41.248
You don't know how it happens.

00:08:41.248 --> 00:09:02.218
Collectively, whatever you feel, I get it
in My Body.

00:09:02.218 --> 00:09:09.878
For example, collectively, if you have a left
Vishuddhi, I get it.

00:09:09.878 --> 00:09:15.919
If you have, say, right Vishuddhi, I get it.

00:09:15.919 --> 00:09:24.968
Any Chakra that you catch, collectively, I
get that problem and I have to solve it because

00:09:24.968 --> 00:09:27.609
it troubles Me, so I solve it.

00:09:27.609 --> 00:09:32.618
It's a compulsion that I have to solve it.

00:09:32.618 --> 00:09:36.329
Now in doing so, you see, you might think,
"Mother, we are troubling."

00:09:36.329 --> 00:09:37.468
You are not.

00:09:37.468 --> 00:09:39.118
It's My doing.

00:09:39.118 --> 00:09:42.208
I have taken you into Myself.

00:09:42.208 --> 00:09:44.669
You haven't.

00:09:44.669 --> 00:09:48.018
So you don't have to worry as to, as if you
are troubling Me.

00:09:48.018 --> 00:09:49.018
It's My own doing.

00:09:49.018 --> 00:09:50.239
It's My own work.

00:09:50.239 --> 00:09:51.239
It's My own responsibility.

00:09:51.239 --> 00:09:55.109
And if I have done it, it's done it because
I am supposed to do it.

00:09:55.109 --> 00:10:00.128
That's the job I have to do.

00:10:00.128 --> 00:10:03.319
So there's nothing to feel bad about it.

00:10:03.319 --> 00:10:06.878
But now, what is the purpose?

00:10:06.878 --> 00:10:16.929
As I told you, is that I could come close
to you and I need not, sort of, fill you with

00:10:16.929 --> 00:10:24.148
fear or awedness, or even a feeling that I
am not a human being.

00:10:24.148 --> 00:10:29.359
I behave exactly like human being, I react
exactly like human beings and all these powers

00:10:29.359 --> 00:10:31.549
are hidden within Myself.

00:10:31.549 --> 00:10:35.609
Unless and until you are a realized soul,
you won't understand.

00:10:35.609 --> 00:10:37.398
Whatever you may do, you won't understand.

00:10:37.398 --> 00:10:43.569
Or maybe in the previous life you had your
Realization, or maybe also you have done such

00:10:43.569 --> 00:10:46.829
tremendous punyas that you can recognize.

00:10:46.829 --> 00:10:51.569
There are people like that who have done it.

00:10:51.569 --> 00:11:03.229
But to make it more, sort of, congenial to
you is to become absolutely a human being.

00:11:03.229 --> 00:11:08.859
So I married, I have children, I have grandchildren
and I do shopping, as you see.

00:11:08.859 --> 00:11:11.539
People are surprised how I take Coca-Cola.

00:11:11.539 --> 00:11:14.419
I'm not supposed to take Coca-Cola!

00:11:14.419 --> 00:11:17.618
Or I eat popcorn.

00:11:17.618 --> 00:11:19.229
They're surprised.

00:11:19.229 --> 00:11:22.549
But I have to be just like you.

00:11:22.549 --> 00:11:25.209
But inside I am not.

00:11:25.209 --> 00:11:26.209
Outside I am.

00:11:26.209 --> 00:11:35.979
You see, My attention is such that it penetrates
into everything, and I remember each and every

00:11:35.979 --> 00:11:37.989
thing very well.

00:11:37.989 --> 00:11:40.559
My memory's very good, even at this age.

00:11:40.559 --> 00:11:47.768
So, you see, this attention itself is very
penetrating, and when it penetrates it carries

00:11:47.768 --> 00:11:53.049
with it all the powers that are required,
and acts.

00:11:53.049 --> 00:11:59.689
It's a tremendous machinery, I should say,
which is very subtle and works wonders.

00:11:59.689 --> 00:12:04.749
So you start telling Me that there is a miracle
that has happened, miracle that has happened.

00:12:04.749 --> 00:12:12.249
Nothing is a miracle because if you're all
in My Body and if My Body is divine, then

00:12:12.249 --> 00:12:13.268
what is a miracle?

00:12:13.268 --> 00:12:18.128
It's all the communication, as this hand can
communicate with this hand, I communicate

00:12:18.128 --> 00:12:19.469
with you.

00:12:19.469 --> 00:12:28.539
But one thing is definite, that you should
not get lost with this rupa of Mahamaya.

00:12:28.539 --> 00:12:32.448
It's a very dangerous thing because once you
get lost, "Oh, Mother!

00:12:32.448 --> 00:12:38.639
After all" - you see, like that - then it
doesn't act, it doesn't work out.

00:12:38.639 --> 00:12:47.289
It's not a casual thing, but I want to live
very casually Myself to show that I'm casual,

00:12:47.289 --> 00:12:48.919
but I am not.

00:12:48.919 --> 00:12:55.569
While you should not pay your attention casually,
that won't work out because you are in My

00:12:55.569 --> 00:12:56.569
Body.

00:12:56.569 --> 00:13:06.109
Say, every cell in My Body is aware, and every
cell has a reflector.

00:13:06.109 --> 00:13:10.258
I don't know about, you know about it, but
there is a reflector in us, which works on

00:13:10.258 --> 00:13:12.578
remote control.

00:13:12.578 --> 00:13:15.939
So it works on remote control on your attention
also.

00:13:15.939 --> 00:13:17.849
If your attention is not all right, it corrects.

00:13:17.849 --> 00:13:23.518
It puts you - that's the best way we could
evolve human beings.

00:13:23.518 --> 00:13:31.639
There was no other way out, because the attention
of the people is, on the whole, in the whole

00:13:31.639 --> 00:13:34.839
world, is not yet on the Spirit.

00:13:34.839 --> 00:13:38.899
But suddenly, they get a glimpse that there
must be something beyond.

00:13:38.899 --> 00:13:41.878
So many religions have come, so many have
talked about it.

00:13:41.878 --> 00:13:49.779
So, they may say about it, they may talk about
it, but still the consciousness that we have

00:13:49.779 --> 00:13:55.258
to be the Spirit is among very few people
and they are the ones called as the seekers

00:13:55.258 --> 00:13:58.188
of truth, while the rest of the people are
not.

00:13:58.188 --> 00:13:59.518
They are busy with this or that.

00:13:59.518 --> 00:14:00.518
"Oh, I'm very happy.

00:14:00.518 --> 00:14:01.740
I'm very happy with myself.

00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:03.698
You enjoy your holiday.

00:14:03.698 --> 00:14:06.318
I'll enjoy my holiday."

00:14:06.318 --> 00:14:08.748
Like that they talk.

00:14:08.748 --> 00:14:16.318
So under these circumstances, one had to come
in a camouflage, enter into like - you see,

00:14:16.318 --> 00:14:22.029
they are like enemies, I would say, enemies
of God's Love.

00:14:22.029 --> 00:14:28.359
So you have to enter into them like a spy,
camouflaging yourself, you see, and make them

00:14:28.359 --> 00:14:30.128
dance here, here and there.

00:14:30.128 --> 00:14:33.359
Let them get lost a little bit here and there.

00:14:33.359 --> 00:14:39.319
Let them see for themselves because with Mahamaya,
you see, She allows you.

00:14:39.319 --> 00:14:44.379
Now, there are some Sahaja Yogis who left
Sahaja Yoga, went off.

00:14:44.379 --> 00:14:48.789
I said, "All right, if they have gone, very
good.

00:14:48.789 --> 00:14:51.018
Good riddance of bad rubbish.

00:14:51.018 --> 00:14:52.018
Doesn't matter."

00:14:52.018 --> 00:14:53.559
And then they again come back.

00:14:53.559 --> 00:14:55.669
"Mother, this happened to us.

00:14:55.669 --> 00:14:57.209
That happened to us.

00:14:57.209 --> 00:14:58.289
Somebody got this.

00:14:58.289 --> 00:14:59.289
Somebody got that.

00:14:59.289 --> 00:15:03.559
We met with an accident, then somebody got
the sickness.

00:15:03.559 --> 00:15:06.359
Somebody is very unhappy.

00:15:06.359 --> 00:15:09.429
We broke our marriage."

00:15:09.429 --> 00:15:20.448
All kinds of things and when they say like
this, I mean, they do like this, I just smile.

00:15:20.448 --> 00:15:21.878
So it's a bad coin.

00:15:21.878 --> 00:15:23.259
All right, doesn't matter.

00:15:23.259 --> 00:15:29.459
Again they come back to Sahaja Yoga, but they
are left behind than others.

00:15:29.459 --> 00:15:34.559
They come up, but slowly, because they have
suffered, so they have come.

00:15:34.559 --> 00:15:40.679
In a way, there's a good example for others
that we don't want to suffer any more.

00:15:40.679 --> 00:15:47.159
The sufferings do not come from Mahamaya,
by any chance.

00:15:47.159 --> 00:16:01.459
On the contrary, once you have called Me the
Mother, you see, there is a protective attention

00:16:01.459 --> 00:16:03.029
on you.

00:16:03.029 --> 00:16:12.089
Then you misbehave, you cross all the limits
and things, then it acts on you.

00:16:12.089 --> 00:16:17.459
This action has taken place in many cases.

00:16:17.459 --> 00:16:23.709
Some of them have come back, some are still
hanging around and are doing wrong things,

00:16:23.709 --> 00:16:28.248
because they have done terribly wrong things
and they know they'll be found out.

00:16:28.248 --> 00:16:32.938
Now the worst thing that happens in Sahaja
Yoga that people try to make money out of

00:16:32.938 --> 00:16:39.878
Me because they know I don't understand money,
I don't understand banking and I'm very bad

00:16:39.878 --> 00:16:46.349
at it; but I'm not.

00:16:46.349 --> 00:16:47.349
I know everything.

00:16:47.349 --> 00:16:48.349
I know everything about everyone.

00:16:48.349 --> 00:16:49.539
They tell me lies.

00:16:49.539 --> 00:16:53.359
I know that they're telling Me lies, but is
allowed.

00:16:53.359 --> 00:16:56.498
Do what you like in Sahaja Yoga.

00:16:56.498 --> 00:17:00.179
You, yourself, will have to pay for it.

00:17:00.179 --> 00:17:06.688
It's something so great with this Mahamaya
rup, that, directly, I don't have to say anything.

00:17:06.688 --> 00:17:08.758
You don't even know that it's done.

00:17:08.758 --> 00:17:11.868
When it happens, they come rushing to Me,
"Mother, it has happened."

00:17:11.868 --> 00:17:19.558
Now, I have not done anything directly, neither
indirectly, but once you go out of the protection

00:17:19.558 --> 00:17:25.318
of your Mother, there are all negative forces
all around you, which also you don't see because

00:17:25.318 --> 00:17:26.839
you are partly blind.

00:17:26.839 --> 00:17:30.939
You couldn't see your Mother and you couldn't
see these negative forces also.

00:17:30.939 --> 00:17:36.938
Then you fall a prey to their talk, things,
whatever it is, or maybe into some paradoxical

00:17:36.938 --> 00:17:38.438
culture, as you have here.

00:17:38.438 --> 00:17:40.878
You may fall a prey to that.

00:17:40.878 --> 00:17:46.018
There's somebody I know in Sahaja Yoga who
has gone now and he's now drinking a lot and

00:17:46.018 --> 00:17:50.138
he's doing all kinds of things.

00:17:50.138 --> 00:17:56.058
So such a person gets lost because of his
doings.

00:17:56.058 --> 00:17:58.758
I am not doing anything to him.

00:17:58.758 --> 00:18:03.748
If you are with Me, if you are in Sahaja Yoga,
you are protected, you are looked after.

00:18:03.748 --> 00:18:09.219
But you have to stick on, you have to have
faith and even if there's any problem, it

00:18:09.219 --> 00:18:10.219
gets solved.

00:18:10.219 --> 00:18:17.209
But those who have gone out of it, who go
beyond My reach, then they suffer.

00:18:17.209 --> 00:18:23.258
So, even indirectly, I would say, I'm not
in any way harming them because I've decided

00:18:23.258 --> 00:18:25.558
not to harm anyone.

00:18:25.558 --> 00:18:26.919
That I have decided on.

00:18:26.919 --> 00:18:30.739
Especially those who call Me "Mother", I don't
want to harm them.

00:18:30.739 --> 00:18:31.739
But they get harmed.

00:18:31.739 --> 00:18:34.328
No doubt, they get harmed very badly.

00:18:34.328 --> 00:18:39.628
So, if it has happened, just take it up, "All
right, doesn't matter.

00:18:39.628 --> 00:18:40.698
Mother forgives everyone.

00:18:40.698 --> 00:18:41.799
It has happened, has happened.

00:18:41.799 --> 00:18:44.109
This is a lesson for me.

00:18:44.109 --> 00:18:48.938
It was something because of it happened and
now I'm back."

00:18:48.938 --> 00:18:55.539
And then you become sometimes a better Sahaja
Yogi than many of them.

00:18:55.539 --> 00:19:05.049
This kind of happening is very common in every
country.

00:19:05.049 --> 00:19:09.389
But you see, this whole culture, I feel, is
so paradoxical.

00:19:09.389 --> 00:19:16.589
Whole culture is so paradoxical, and what
is paid for is something that is ugly.

00:19:16.589 --> 00:19:21.219
What is paid for is something that is sinful.

00:19:21.219 --> 00:19:25.849
Whatever that is filthy, dirty is paid for
and accepted.

00:19:25.849 --> 00:19:32.259
It's very paradoxical because it goes against
growth of spirituality.

00:19:32.259 --> 00:19:36.479
One side, you are spiritual, you want to be
spiritual.

00:19:36.479 --> 00:19:42.428
Another side you have this paradoxical culture,
which takes you down to hell.

00:19:42.428 --> 00:19:46.589
It's like a story once Babamama told Me.

00:19:46.589 --> 00:19:50.069
Very interesting story it is.

00:19:50.069 --> 00:19:57.479
He said that some people did lots of punyas,
so they were taken to heaven, but they saw

00:19:57.479 --> 00:19:59.199
everybody was meditating, nicely enjoying.

00:19:59.199 --> 00:20:00.849
He said, "What is this?

00:20:00.849 --> 00:20:03.159
We did this also with Sahaja Yoga.

00:20:03.159 --> 00:20:05.239
What's the use of doing it here again?

00:20:05.239 --> 00:20:09.689
We should have something else, so let's have
a look at the hell."

00:20:09.689 --> 00:20:15.649
So they went down to see the hell and outside
they were having all these paradoxical culture

00:20:15.649 --> 00:20:19.619
of nude women and nude men dancing, shouting,
screaming.

00:20:19.619 --> 00:20:22.069
Dirty, filthy things going on there.

00:20:22.069 --> 00:20:27.169
So they said, "This seems to be different,
you know."

00:20:27.169 --> 00:20:31.489
So the people who were doing all these acts,
they asked, "Why are you here?"

00:20:31.489 --> 00:20:36.159
They said, "We've come here only for seeing
the hell."

00:20:36.159 --> 00:20:37.549
"Oh, all right.

00:20:37.549 --> 00:20:38.549
There are peepholes.

00:20:38.549 --> 00:20:39.549
You see through them."

00:20:39.549 --> 00:20:43.219
So they had big, big holes, out of which they
started seeing.

00:20:43.219 --> 00:20:51.809
So in one hole they saw people being put into
some sort of a filth, a pus and this and that.

00:20:51.809 --> 00:20:53.519
Another into feces, this, that.

00:20:53.519 --> 00:21:00.879
Another into a sort of a mire out of which
they could not come out, shouting.

00:21:00.879 --> 00:21:06.439
Then there's another one where they were boiled
in the boiling oil and some were beaten up.

00:21:06.439 --> 00:21:10.149
There were snakes and scorpions and this and
that.

00:21:10.149 --> 00:21:12.069
They said, "What is this all?"

00:21:12.069 --> 00:21:13.949
"That is hell you wanted to see.

00:21:13.949 --> 00:21:14.949
That is hell.

00:21:14.949 --> 00:21:16.109
You want to go, you can go there."

00:21:16.109 --> 00:21:20.559
So they said, "What are you doing here?"

00:21:20.559 --> 00:21:23.499
"This is publicity department.

00:21:23.499 --> 00:21:26.479
For hell."

00:21:26.479 --> 00:21:35.129
They ran back to heaven and asked forgiveness
that "We don't want, we don't want this hell,

00:21:35.129 --> 00:21:37.489
had enough of it."

00:21:37.489 --> 00:21:40.899
So, like that, you see, the whole world is
a camouflage.

00:21:40.899 --> 00:21:49.809
If you see, this is an anti-Mahamaya.

00:21:49.809 --> 00:21:54.719
So they say that this maya is created by God.

00:21:54.719 --> 00:21:56.089
No.

00:21:56.089 --> 00:22:02.999
Maya that God has created is this world, this
whole universe and all that.

00:22:02.999 --> 00:22:07.089
But this illusive life is created by human
beings.

00:22:07.089 --> 00:22:13.669
Absolutely, through their projections of their
brains and mental capacities, they have projected

00:22:13.669 --> 00:22:16.379
because money is everything.

00:22:16.379 --> 00:22:21.029
If money is everything, by hook or crook,
if you have to get the money, then do what

00:22:21.029 --> 00:22:22.029
you like.

00:22:22.029 --> 00:22:27.119
And every day you read in the newspaper, I
mean horrible stories about how people want

00:22:27.119 --> 00:22:32.049
to make money, how they want to sell their
daughters, how they want to sell their wives.

00:22:32.049 --> 00:22:35.429
Anything is all right as long as you have
money.

00:22:35.429 --> 00:22:38.159
If you can make money, nothing matters.

00:22:38.159 --> 00:22:48.929
So this is one of the illusions that human
beings have created is what you call is "money

00:22:48.929 --> 00:22:55.149
maya" and, in that, comes also the wealth,
possessions, materialism.

00:22:55.149 --> 00:23:04.039
Everything is created by human beings, and
this creation of materialism then boils you

00:23:04.039 --> 00:23:13.509
down to a personality which is involved in
all sinful act.

00:23:13.509 --> 00:23:18.139
Everything is all right because if money is
all right, materialism is all right.

00:23:18.139 --> 00:23:27.459
For example, the way people went down to America
- Spanish - and killed so many aboriginals

00:23:27.459 --> 00:23:28.459
there.

00:23:28.459 --> 00:23:34.669
Then also English went and all kinds of people
went there in America.

00:23:34.669 --> 00:23:41.879
The way they have tortured is something, is
you cannot think how human beings can behave

00:23:41.879 --> 00:23:51.749
like this towards ordinary people, who are
just simple people living in the jungles.

00:23:51.749 --> 00:23:59.819
How can you do such a thing to them, such
horrible, you can call it a genocide?

00:23:59.819 --> 00:24:03.689
It's really a terrible thing, they did it.

00:24:03.689 --> 00:24:10.279
We know more about these Germans, the way
they behaved recently, but even in those days

00:24:10.279 --> 00:24:12.849
they used to do all kinds of things.

00:24:12.849 --> 00:24:18.239
And the nature, which is a Maya of God, which
how it takes respite.

00:24:18.239 --> 00:24:26.119
There were people in America, Central America,
near River Mississippi in Missouri.

00:24:26.119 --> 00:24:29.029
They're called as rednecks long time.

00:24:29.029 --> 00:24:31.649
He must be remembering this.

00:24:31.649 --> 00:24:37.399
And because they were called rednecks by the
blacks, they used to kill so many blacks,

00:24:37.399 --> 00:24:43.599
they used to hang their children on the tree,
they used to throw their bodies in the river,

00:24:43.599 --> 00:24:51.379
sometimes get them drowned; did all kinds
of things to the black people, under the name

00:24:51.379 --> 00:24:57.109
that they were white people and they're superior
and something like that, behaving worse than

00:24:57.109 --> 00:24:58.639
animals.

00:24:58.639 --> 00:25:07.909
Now you know, there, floods came in, terrible
floods came in and those floods drowned these

00:25:07.909 --> 00:25:13.779
rednecks beyond their necks and so many were
dead.

00:25:13.779 --> 00:25:16.369
One would say that "How could it happen?"

00:25:16.369 --> 00:25:17.369
It is.

00:25:17.369 --> 00:25:24.309
Another example I'll give you is the, you
see, the way Americans were treating all these

00:25:24.309 --> 00:25:32.579
Bolivians and the Colombians, that they would
buy everything from them very cheaply, and

00:25:32.579 --> 00:25:35.629
like wheat and everything, very cheap.

00:25:35.629 --> 00:25:42.019
Just the minimum profits they had, and they
would sell it at a double price and make money.

00:25:42.019 --> 00:25:50.829
All this was really criminal to do from any
point of view, but they were doing it.

00:25:50.829 --> 00:25:59.229
I went to - I don't know what year it was,
1978 or so - into Colombia and there was one

00:25:59.229 --> 00:26:00.399
man came in the party.

00:26:00.399 --> 00:26:01.399
I was with My husband.

00:26:01.399 --> 00:26:05.439
He said, "I've heard You are a great, saintly
person from India.

00:26:05.439 --> 00:26:11.449
Can You give us some blessings that we really
hit these Americans nicely and see them off?

00:26:11.449 --> 00:26:19.049
Because the way they are exposing us to our
poverty and things, they're horrible."

00:26:19.049 --> 00:26:22.699
I said, "Why do you want to hit them?"

00:26:22.699 --> 00:26:24.629
"No, they require it, otherwise they'll not
be all right."

00:26:24.629 --> 00:26:25.799
I was just in the party.

00:26:25.799 --> 00:26:27.439
I didn't want to discuss it.

00:26:27.439 --> 00:26:28.439
"All right."

00:26:28.439 --> 00:26:33.979
And, you know, this cocaine came up there.

00:26:33.979 --> 00:26:39.039
And if you go and see now that place - I've
been to, Bogota, with My husband - it was

00:26:39.039 --> 00:26:45.109
like a shanty town, absolutely like a shanty
town, made of tin and this and that.

00:26:45.109 --> 00:26:49.889
Now, big, big buildings are there, and you
have escalators and everything.

00:26:49.889 --> 00:26:54.709
They used to bring petroleum with the donkey's
cart.

00:26:54.709 --> 00:26:56.889
Can you imagine?

00:26:56.889 --> 00:27:03.359
In such a short time it has become such a
big country and not only that, but now the

00:27:03.359 --> 00:27:08.679
whole America is afraid of them, even Australia.

00:27:08.679 --> 00:27:13.129
The drugs are taken by Americans themselves.

00:27:13.129 --> 00:27:21.239
In Washington there is such a lot of storage
of drugs that they don't know what to do,

00:27:21.239 --> 00:27:23.869
and even the senators are taking to drugs.

00:27:23.869 --> 00:27:24.869
Can you imagine?

00:27:24.869 --> 00:27:29.899
I wouldn't be surprised one day Mr. Clinton
lands up with some drugs.

00:27:29.899 --> 00:27:34.759
The way it is such a fashion, it is such a
fantastic thing for them.

00:27:34.759 --> 00:27:40.119
You go to any party of elite people, which
I have to some time, they only talk about

00:27:40.119 --> 00:27:41.119
drugs, you see.

00:27:41.119 --> 00:27:42.119
"You want?

00:27:42.119 --> 00:27:43.799
Which drug do you like?"

00:27:43.799 --> 00:27:45.559
I said, "I don't like any drug."

00:27:45.559 --> 00:27:46.559
"No.

00:27:46.559 --> 00:27:49.609
If you want, you can get it cheaply in this,
you know, if you go there and get it there."

00:27:49.609 --> 00:27:51.569
They discuss it in the elite parties.

00:27:51.569 --> 00:27:56.469
Also about gurus, you see, which guru you
want.

00:27:56.469 --> 00:27:59.299
"There is a sale on of a such-and-such guru.

00:27:59.299 --> 00:28:01.319
On a bargain you can go."

00:28:01.319 --> 00:28:02.319
Like that.

00:28:02.319 --> 00:28:04.499
You know, it's all so stupid, I tell you.

00:28:04.499 --> 00:28:08.389
I said, "These people are so immature, worse
than children."

00:28:08.389 --> 00:28:11.849
They are not grown up, only in age.

00:28:11.849 --> 00:28:19.269
They have done good maybe in mechanism and
all those things, but that has nothing to

00:28:19.269 --> 00:28:27.669
do with your personality growth, and that's
why I find them just like dwarves the way

00:28:27.669 --> 00:28:30.209
they have attitude towards things.

00:28:30.209 --> 00:28:38.629
And everyone practically must have taken drugs,
everybody except for Asians may not have,

00:28:38.629 --> 00:28:44.529
because now I have learnt that there are two
genes which protect the Asians, but the white

00:28:44.529 --> 00:28:46.819
skin has not those genes which are to protect.

00:28:46.819 --> 00:28:52.649
The other day in the lecture I told them that
there are two genes which are protective,

00:28:52.649 --> 00:28:55.999
found only among Asians, means Chinese and
Indians.

00:28:55.999 --> 00:29:00.619
All the rest of the people don't have those
genes, which should protect them.

00:29:00.619 --> 00:29:07.019
So they are so vulnerable to all these nonsensical
things that are going on, and they take to

00:29:07.019 --> 00:29:08.019
it so easily.

00:29:08.019 --> 00:29:13.539
I used to wonder how these educated, good
people, I mean people of My husband's ranking

00:29:13.539 --> 00:29:15.919
also were stupid like that.

00:29:15.919 --> 00:29:18.049
Every time they would bring a new wife.

00:29:18.049 --> 00:29:24.089
One day they brought, one of them, brought
a wife who was hardly about twenty years of

00:29:24.089 --> 00:29:25.089
age.

00:29:25.089 --> 00:29:26.679
This fellow is at least seventy.

00:29:26.679 --> 00:29:27.679
I didn't know.

00:29:27.679 --> 00:29:28.679
My husband pinched Me.

00:29:28.679 --> 00:29:30.779
He said, "That's his wife.

00:29:30.779 --> 00:29:31.779
All right?

00:29:31.779 --> 00:29:33.759
Don't call her a grand-daughter."

00:29:33.759 --> 00:29:39.229
I used to drop bricks after bricks there.

00:29:39.229 --> 00:29:44.719
Such absurd people coming, and a seventy-year-old
man coming with a lady who's twenty years.

00:29:44.719 --> 00:29:49.129
I mean, you can never think that she could
be his wife.

00:29:49.129 --> 00:29:53.499
At the most a sister-in-law, at the most,
but I thought she was the grand-daughter so

00:29:53.499 --> 00:29:55.229
he pinched Me and told Me that "Don't."

00:29:55.229 --> 00:29:57.609
This is it, you see.

00:29:57.609 --> 00:30:03.349
It's such a paradoxical world that if you
come from Sahaj to this, you see "What's going

00:30:03.349 --> 00:30:04.349
on?

00:30:04.349 --> 00:30:05.349
What are they doing?

00:30:05.349 --> 00:30:07.239
What's the matter with them?"

00:30:07.239 --> 00:30:12.729
Now, taking out clothes, is it something great
to take out clothes, you see?

00:30:12.729 --> 00:30:19.639
In Switzerland, which is such a cold country,
I was wearing My sweater, My coat, covering

00:30:19.639 --> 00:30:26.169
My head, wearing warm socks, everything because
they said, "Let's go out for, just for a drive."

00:30:26.169 --> 00:30:29.149
So, we got down.

00:30:29.149 --> 00:30:32.879
There's one lake called Lausanne.

00:30:32.879 --> 00:30:34.279
Lausanne, there's a very big lake.

00:30:34.279 --> 00:30:37.089
So, as usual, Gregoire ran up to see how is
the situation there.

00:30:37.089 --> 00:30:38.539
He came back with a double speed.

00:30:38.539 --> 00:30:40.639
He said, "No, no, Mother, You can't go there."

00:30:40.639 --> 00:30:41.639
I said, "Why?"

00:30:41.639 --> 00:30:42.639
"No.

00:30:42.639 --> 00:30:43.639
You can't.

00:30:43.639 --> 00:30:44.639
I am sorry.

00:30:44.639 --> 00:30:45.639
You can't.

00:30:45.639 --> 00:30:46.639
Let's go."

00:30:46.639 --> 00:30:47.969
They were all topless women sitting there.

00:30:47.969 --> 00:30:54.649
You know, this - in Australia they had, and
even New Zealand, they had cricket match.

00:30:54.649 --> 00:30:58.809
They're supposed to be very good cricketers.

00:30:58.809 --> 00:31:01.679
And when we opened the TV, the women were
sitting topless.

00:31:01.679 --> 00:31:03.099
We closed it.

00:31:03.099 --> 00:31:07.629
We couldn't see that, but I was told now they're
losing in cricket.

00:31:07.629 --> 00:31:14.469
They will, definitely, compared to Indian
spinners, who are young innocent boys, you

00:31:14.469 --> 00:31:16.529
see - very young, twenty, twenty-one.

00:31:16.529 --> 00:31:21.289
They have to be because there's no innocence,
there's no chastity, there's no respect.

00:31:21.289 --> 00:31:23.149
The women are sitting topless.

00:31:23.149 --> 00:31:24.379
How can they win?

00:31:24.379 --> 00:31:26.779
They're insulting the Goddess there only.

00:31:26.779 --> 00:31:27.879
How can they win?

00:31:27.879 --> 00:31:33.039
They cannot win, and a game like cricket is
something sensible.

00:31:33.039 --> 00:31:39.569
Even, I don't know, in any game if they can
win, because if this - distract the attention

00:31:39.569 --> 00:31:40.569
completely.

00:31:40.569 --> 00:31:43.149
But why do they go like that?

00:31:43.149 --> 00:31:46.739
Are all women trying to become prostitutes?

00:31:46.739 --> 00:31:48.599
What is the sense in it?

00:31:48.599 --> 00:31:51.019
I can't understand.

00:31:51.019 --> 00:31:53.119
And this is something they don't understand.

00:31:53.119 --> 00:31:58.769
If you tell them that, "You see, I was told
that Mrs. Thatcher openly said that in this

00:31:58.769 --> 00:32:03.159
culture women must expose their body."

00:32:03.159 --> 00:32:05.239
There's such a paradox.

00:32:05.239 --> 00:32:06.609
Can't understand.

00:32:06.609 --> 00:32:12.879
They show here Mother Mary as the sublime
personality, and they show here women as the

00:32:12.879 --> 00:32:15.859
- women who are nude.

00:32:15.859 --> 00:32:20.839
They want to become Mother Mary or what do
they want to become?

00:32:20.839 --> 00:32:26.119
And people like this, horrible people like
this Michael Jackson - he is that - are so

00:32:26.119 --> 00:32:27.949
prominent making money.

00:32:27.949 --> 00:32:29.679
I mean, just see the paradox.

00:32:29.679 --> 00:32:40.379
Can you say that this is an advanced country
when the ideas are so, so low?

00:32:40.379 --> 00:32:44.359
How can it be?

00:32:44.359 --> 00:32:52.059
After coming to Sahaja Yoga, you can see for
yourself, but it makes your, these protective

00:32:52.059 --> 00:32:53.579
genes established in you.

00:32:53.579 --> 00:32:56.309
This is the thing in Sahaj Yoga.

00:32:56.309 --> 00:32:58.739
And suddenly, you people have given up all
that nonsense.

00:32:58.739 --> 00:33:00.989
You don't want all that now.

00:33:00.989 --> 00:33:08.639
Actually, if you see it properly from any
logical point of view, you see, without the

00:33:08.639 --> 00:33:14.132
Maya of this nonsense - if you see it, you
can logically understand that it is wrong.

00:33:14.132 --> 00:33:20.199
You see, why do you feel jealous of another
man or woman?

00:33:20.199 --> 00:33:21.538
You feel jealous.

00:33:21.538 --> 00:33:25.109
That means you want just life, isn't it?

00:33:25.109 --> 00:33:31.409
People have murdered, women have murdered
men or women because they were jealous.

00:33:31.409 --> 00:33:39.569
If it was natural and normal and joy giving,
you should not have felt bad about it.

00:33:39.569 --> 00:33:44.649
All these things should logically be understood
that, why we don't like this happening.

00:33:44.649 --> 00:33:47.519
Or this happens to your own daughter, you
may not like.

00:33:47.519 --> 00:33:52.139
Nowadays there are people who like it, also,
to the daughters.

00:33:52.139 --> 00:33:58.239
But - now going to that limit of things, like
there's one person, say, he has something

00:33:58.239 --> 00:34:02.989
to do with the daughter and the whole society's
against it, today.

00:34:02.989 --> 00:34:10.809
But maybe tomorrow, with this Maya, this horrible
devil-maya, which is anti-maya, will work

00:34:10.809 --> 00:34:14.759
out and maybe that nobody will mind it.

00:34:14.759 --> 00:34:16.379
It may be.

00:34:16.379 --> 00:34:24.879
If you people do not hold it right into your
hands, the culture side of Sahaj, I don't

00:34:24.879 --> 00:34:26.129
know what's going to happen.

00:34:26.129 --> 00:34:30.609
If you read newspaper every day, you feel
really dizzy, you don't understand in what

00:34:30.609 --> 00:34:32.658
Maya these people are lost.

00:34:32.658 --> 00:34:34.819
So it's an anti-maya.

00:34:34.819 --> 00:34:38.559
Because Mahamaya has come, so anti-maya has
come.

00:34:38.559 --> 00:34:43.759
Fifty years back or sixty years back, it was
not that bad, I can tell you.

00:34:43.759 --> 00:34:49.239
Once in a while people used to do something
nonsensical, but now it is rampant.

00:34:49.239 --> 00:34:51.799
But it now has become a fashion.

00:34:51.799 --> 00:34:57.779
It's worse than that, is that accepted as
a fashion, and if you're not in it, you're

00:34:57.779 --> 00:34:58.779
out.

00:34:58.779 --> 00:35:02.909
You have to be in the madhouse.

00:35:02.909 --> 00:35:08.199
You should see this clearly because now you
have come into the Maya of God.

00:35:08.199 --> 00:35:15.549
"Maya" also means love, the God's love, and,
in that, your eyes should open out and see:

00:35:15.549 --> 00:35:18.219
what horrible things this they are doing?

00:35:18.219 --> 00:35:19.219
What is this disco?

00:35:19.219 --> 00:35:25.009
You know, in India they brought the disco
and, of course, some boys who were Muslims

00:35:25.009 --> 00:35:32.809
actually were rich and they carried young
girls, because in disco the law was that you

00:35:32.809 --> 00:35:39.089
must bring your partner - young girls who
were adults, maybe not be adults also, and

00:35:39.089 --> 00:35:44.969
started giving them alcohol, drinking and
they got lost.

00:35:44.969 --> 00:35:46.329
The parents wouldn't accept them.

00:35:46.329 --> 00:35:52.019
They had to go to brothels or they were sold
out or I don't know what happened to them.

00:35:52.019 --> 00:35:54.299
But that is the reaction in that country.

00:35:54.299 --> 00:35:56.609
It may be one day they'll be accepted.

00:35:56.609 --> 00:36:02.559
One day we'll have the same thing because
it has such a overpowering effect, and that's

00:36:02.559 --> 00:36:05.329
why the Maya of God is such.

00:36:05.329 --> 00:36:12.649
This, all these beautiful things are there
so you can get lost with it, you can see it,

00:36:12.649 --> 00:36:15.139
you can picture it, you can paint it.

00:36:15.139 --> 00:36:17.479
But no, they are not - they're not interested.

00:36:17.479 --> 00:36:19.199
They'll make this also ugly.

00:36:19.199 --> 00:36:20.799
They'll make every picture ugly.

00:36:20.799 --> 00:36:23.259
They'll make every face ugly.

00:36:23.259 --> 00:36:29.469
So this is the anti-maya that is there and,
for that, you need a Mahamaya to correct it

00:36:29.469 --> 00:36:32.389
and to solve the problem.

00:36:32.389 --> 00:36:38.009
The complete working of the Divine depends
on you people, wherever you are.

00:36:38.009 --> 00:36:46.989
How many you are is not the point - wherever
you are, how intense you are, how you want

00:36:46.989 --> 00:36:54.109
to work it out, how you want to put your attention
to.

00:36:54.109 --> 00:37:01.648
It's very important how you are going to do,
it because you people should understand the

00:37:01.648 --> 00:37:02.648
responsibility.

00:37:02.648 --> 00:37:09.588
This world is getting drowned, and I feel
that at least eighty percent people will be

00:37:09.588 --> 00:37:11.068
finished.

00:37:11.068 --> 00:37:17.679
Ten would be hanging in between in limbo I
think, really, and ten percent will be Sahaja

00:37:17.679 --> 00:37:19.998
Yogis, the way it is moving in the West.

00:37:19.998 --> 00:37:21.918
Maybe in India may not be.

00:37:21.918 --> 00:37:22.918
I can't say.

00:37:22.918 --> 00:37:25.279
India is very fast-moving Sahaja Yoga.

00:37:25.279 --> 00:37:30.388
Also Russia and all these Eastern Bloc people
are just jumping into it.

00:37:30.388 --> 00:37:33.508
I don't know how they have discovered Me so
easily.

00:37:33.508 --> 00:37:34.729
They say My Face is evident.

00:37:34.729 --> 00:37:42.618
I don't know what makes them think.

00:37:42.618 --> 00:37:45.889
The another Maya is of power.

00:37:45.889 --> 00:37:52.879
And the power of money if they can avoid,
then they try to have power over territory,

00:37:52.879 --> 00:37:55.639
of the land, this, that.

00:37:55.639 --> 00:38:00.959
That also made them mad quite a lot in the
past, but now they're all fighting for some

00:38:00.959 --> 00:38:03.989
nonsensical land, which will never belong
to them.

00:38:03.989 --> 00:38:08.469
It stays here permanently, eternally, but
the fights are going on.

00:38:08.469 --> 00:38:14.528
Then, in the name of religion, they're fighting
for this area, that area or they're fighting

00:38:14.528 --> 00:38:22.528
for, say, just for changing their religion
or getting more people in that religion.

00:38:22.528 --> 00:38:26.239
I don't know what is their idea of religion
is.

00:38:26.239 --> 00:38:28.149
Is religion meant for that?

00:38:28.149 --> 00:38:29.559
Just think of it.

00:38:29.559 --> 00:38:31.139
Nobody thinks like that.

00:38:31.139 --> 00:38:33.659
What is it meant for?

00:38:33.659 --> 00:38:39.779
So here, again, the Mahamaya has to work and
the Mahamaya works this way, that She integrates

00:38:39.779 --> 00:38:41.308
all the religions.

00:38:41.308 --> 00:38:46.858
She shows that all religions are the same,
have the same spirituality.

00:38:46.858 --> 00:38:52.038
It's on the same tree of spirituality, they
have grown.

00:38:52.038 --> 00:38:56.209
Instead of making people spiritual, they have
made them money-oriented or they have made

00:38:56.209 --> 00:38:59.229
them power-oriented.

00:38:59.229 --> 00:39:01.209
I mean it's the other way round.

00:39:01.209 --> 00:39:09.348
It's like the tree growing underneath or something,
something absurd that you cannot explain and

00:39:09.348 --> 00:39:12.239
that is the thing is that illusive.

00:39:12.239 --> 00:39:13.919
That illusiveness is called Maya.

00:39:13.919 --> 00:39:20.379
And this illusiveness appeals to many people.

00:39:20.379 --> 00:39:23.098
Appeals - that's the point I'm worried about.

00:39:23.098 --> 00:39:30.248
Something is illusive, then they go on running
after that like a mirage and ultimately they

00:39:30.248 --> 00:39:31.248
are destroyed.

00:39:31.248 --> 00:39:38.899
So what you see, a picture just now, is that
at least so many - ten percent people - will

00:39:38.899 --> 00:39:40.969
be saved, at the most.

00:39:40.969 --> 00:39:47.038
But this is a very sad affair because it has
taken so much effort to make human beings,

00:39:47.038 --> 00:39:52.758
to make them all right, to make them sensible
and now what you find is that they are going

00:39:52.758 --> 00:39:53.998
to be all finished.

00:39:53.998 --> 00:40:00.219
It's too much to bear, too much to believe
in, but it is going to happen, if you people

00:40:00.219 --> 00:40:03.149
do not take it up seriously and work it out.

00:40:03.149 --> 00:40:08.949
For you, also, there should not be any illusions
because many of you are more busy with other

00:40:08.949 --> 00:40:09.949
things.

00:40:09.949 --> 00:40:12.798
To you other things are more important than
Sahaja Yoga.

00:40:12.798 --> 00:40:16.229
But whatever you are doing, you can bring
in Sahaja Yoga into that.

00:40:16.229 --> 00:40:18.969
Into anything you can bring in Sahaja Yoga.

00:40:18.969 --> 00:40:24.639
I said in politics, in agriculture, in social
life, in your jobs, everywhere you can bring

00:40:24.639 --> 00:40:25.639
Sahaja Yoga.

00:40:25.639 --> 00:40:33.518
By your own behavior, by your own intelligence,
you can bring in Sahaja Yoga into every field,

00:40:33.518 --> 00:40:36.798
which you have to think about, "Where can
we take Sahaj Yoga?

00:40:36.798 --> 00:40:38.149
Where can we work it out?"

00:40:38.149 --> 00:40:47.139
And this is what is to get into the Maya of
God, that you get rid of all the illusions

00:40:47.139 --> 00:40:52.509
which are false, which do not allow you to
see the right thing, and then seriously to

00:40:52.509 --> 00:40:55.819
get into the productive side of Sahaja Yoga.

00:40:55.819 --> 00:41:02.209
Can you imagine how productive is Sahaja Yoga,
how the miracles work out, how there is this

00:41:02.209 --> 00:41:07.029
Divine Power is anxious to help, despite all
this Mahamaya and all that.

00:41:07.029 --> 00:41:14.439
I'll give you the example of My grandson now
because this time we had a big Maya on him.

00:41:14.439 --> 00:41:18.779
He was - I told him that, "You should not
go to Cambridge, you know."

00:41:18.779 --> 00:41:22.949
I said, "They don't give admissions normally
and, moreover, it's more sort of theoretical

00:41:22.949 --> 00:41:25.239
things, not actually good for you.

00:41:25.239 --> 00:41:28.129
You'll be bored stupid there, so don't go."

00:41:28.129 --> 00:41:29.499
He wouldn't listen to Me.

00:41:29.499 --> 00:41:33.889
Then he agreed, "All right, if I get admission
in these, these big universities in America

00:41:33.889 --> 00:41:34.889
I'll go."

00:41:34.889 --> 00:41:35.989
But he didn't try.

00:41:35.989 --> 00:41:36.989
Nothing of the kind.

00:41:36.989 --> 00:41:42.969
Last minute we sent him a application and
he sent that application.

00:41:42.969 --> 00:41:44.169
Last minute.

00:41:44.169 --> 00:41:46.529
They said, "You cannot come.

00:41:46.529 --> 00:41:47.529
This is that.

00:41:47.529 --> 00:41:53.739
You have to prepare for this exam, SAT exam,
that exam", and then he got a fright.

00:41:53.739 --> 00:41:54.739
You see, which he learnt.

00:41:54.739 --> 00:41:57.018
"My God, I thought so easy to go to America.

00:41:57.018 --> 00:41:58.669
It is not."

00:41:58.669 --> 00:42:01.159
Even if you certify money it is not easy.

00:42:01.159 --> 00:42:06.369
Then he started thinking that "What was I
thinking about Cambridge, Cambridge so much?

00:42:06.369 --> 00:42:09.919
This is the same, equally the same difficult
thing.

00:42:09.919 --> 00:42:16.399
" Until then he wanted to go for SAT, there
to sit for an exam, but actually the appearing

00:42:16.399 --> 00:42:21.719
of the examination was only after six days
and I thought, "How can he go?

00:42:21.719 --> 00:42:23.949
Six days he cannot prepare even."

00:42:23.949 --> 00:42:26.169
So they said, "You cannot come for SAT here."

00:42:26.169 --> 00:42:28.058
Now he was settled down in India.

00:42:28.058 --> 00:42:29.499
He didn't know what to do.

00:42:29.499 --> 00:42:33.699
Still he was saying, "I'll try for this Cambridge
again and this."

00:42:33.699 --> 00:42:35.389
I said, "Now, forget it."

00:42:35.389 --> 00:42:37.619
He wouldn't listen to Me.

00:42:37.619 --> 00:42:39.098
Then he was very disappointed.

00:42:39.098 --> 00:42:45.579
He telephoned to Me to say that "I think that
if I have to go to America, I'll go in a good

00:42:45.579 --> 00:42:46.579
university.

00:42:46.579 --> 00:42:51.758
Otherwise, no use going to a cheap university;
I can get better education in India."

00:42:51.758 --> 00:42:52.758
So I said, "All right."

00:42:52.758 --> 00:42:56.699
Then I gave a bandhan because he wanted to
go abroad and learn something.

00:42:56.699 --> 00:42:57.699
It's all right.

00:42:57.699 --> 00:43:01.719
Can you imagine, it has worked like a real
miracle.

00:43:01.719 --> 00:43:06.909
The university wrote to him that he is admitted
unconditionally.

00:43:06.909 --> 00:43:07.949
Nobody did anything.

00:43:07.949 --> 00:43:10.479
Nobody wrote anything.

00:43:10.479 --> 00:43:11.749
Nothing.

00:43:11.749 --> 00:43:12.749
They have said it.

00:43:12.749 --> 00:43:17.858
None of them can understand what has happened,
how did they get unconditional admission?

00:43:17.858 --> 00:43:23.679
So, you see, it's a miracle, but before that
this Maya was to be played, otherwise he would

00:43:23.679 --> 00:43:26.808
never have seen the importance of it.

00:43:26.808 --> 00:43:29.288
So, in your lives also, such a Maya plays.

00:43:29.288 --> 00:43:31.469
When you do not want to do the right thing.

00:43:31.469 --> 00:43:33.008
All right, do it.

00:43:33.008 --> 00:43:34.169
You do this.

00:43:34.169 --> 00:43:35.709
All right, do that.

00:43:35.709 --> 00:43:36.709
Do that.

00:43:36.709 --> 00:43:38.419
Ultimately, you learn a lesson.

00:43:38.419 --> 00:43:40.748
I don't say no, if you say, "Mother, I want
to do it."

00:43:40.748 --> 00:43:41.748
"All right, go ahead."

00:43:41.748 --> 00:43:42.748
"I want to do that."

00:43:42.748 --> 00:43:45.249
"Oh, go ahead, whatever you want to do."

00:43:45.249 --> 00:43:50.159
If I find you congenial, I may tell you that
"Better not do, it's not going to help you."

00:43:50.159 --> 00:43:57.939
But then they,when they get a complete disillusionment,
then they take to the right decision, come

00:43:57.939 --> 00:44:04.209
to the right thing because, see, let them
try with their own freedom, but then they

00:44:04.209 --> 00:44:05.998
realize that, "What Mother said was right.

00:44:05.998 --> 00:44:07.588
I should have done that.

00:44:07.588 --> 00:44:08.689
All right."

00:44:08.689 --> 00:44:09.909
So this is it.

00:44:09.909 --> 00:44:14.930
The Maya is like this, that it allows you
to do what you like.

00:44:14.930 --> 00:44:16.479
You use your freedom.

00:44:16.479 --> 00:44:17.719
You go places to places.

00:44:17.719 --> 00:44:19.949
Do what you want to do.

00:44:19.949 --> 00:44:21.649
Whatever you think it proper, you do it.

00:44:21.649 --> 00:44:28.409
All right, this is a part of the Maya, but
Mahamaya is that which brings you back, brings

00:44:28.409 --> 00:44:35.459
you back to normal, brings you back to reality,
to understand.

00:44:35.459 --> 00:44:39.139
It is at that point when you understand Mahamaya.

00:44:39.139 --> 00:44:41.788
Like I would say Russians did.

00:44:41.788 --> 00:44:47.229
How they understood that I'm doing greater
work than Einstein?

00:44:47.229 --> 00:44:50.068
"See, what is Einstein?

00:44:50.068 --> 00:44:52.729
He is just working with the matter.

00:44:52.729 --> 00:44:56.088
You are working with human beings, do You
realize, Mother."

00:44:56.088 --> 00:45:01.519
To them I am higher than all of them, greater
than all of them, which is a fact also, I

00:45:01.519 --> 00:45:02.519
must say.

00:45:02.519 --> 00:45:09.329
It's fact in a way that the way work is done,
but doesn't mean that it's something to be

00:45:09.329 --> 00:45:12.768
ego about it, because if I am made like that,
I am doing it.

00:45:12.768 --> 00:45:13.768
What is so special?

00:45:13.768 --> 00:45:17.369
I've been like this, so I'm like that.

00:45:17.369 --> 00:45:18.949
What is so special?

00:45:18.949 --> 00:45:23.429
One gets the pride and the ego only when you
think you are doing something more beyond

00:45:23.429 --> 00:45:24.429
you.

00:45:24.429 --> 00:45:25.429
You see, it's all there.

00:45:25.429 --> 00:45:26.429
I've already got it.

00:45:26.429 --> 00:45:28.578
Now, see this tent is meant to give shade.

00:45:28.578 --> 00:45:34.038
Now if it is giving shade, should it have
ego?

00:45:34.038 --> 00:45:35.848
Sun is meant to give you light.

00:45:35.848 --> 00:45:41.078
If it is giving light, it's giving light because
God has given him the light to be given, so

00:45:41.078 --> 00:45:42.498
he's giving light to you.

00:45:42.498 --> 00:45:43.988
Should he have ego?

00:45:43.988 --> 00:45:51.729
But you'll be, you see, assume that you have
got something special about you, then you

00:45:51.729 --> 00:45:53.608
have to do that, whatever special you have.

00:45:53.608 --> 00:45:57.429
Now, the flowers are so beautiful, they're
so special, so charming.

00:45:57.429 --> 00:46:00.779
I mean, I couldn't take out My attention from
them, they're so beautiful.

00:46:00.779 --> 00:46:03.889
All right, but if they are so, they are so.

00:46:03.889 --> 00:46:04.999
What is there?

00:46:04.999 --> 00:46:10.229
They're not going to have ego about it, that
"We are so good, we are so beautiful."

00:46:10.229 --> 00:46:13.449
No, none of that.

00:46:13.449 --> 00:46:20.788
So this ego comes when there is again the
Mahamaya part of it, that you are in the Maya

00:46:20.788 --> 00:46:24.528
of your own understanding.

00:46:24.528 --> 00:46:27.018
Now you're Sahaja Yogis.

00:46:27.018 --> 00:46:28.149
You should be very proud.

00:46:28.149 --> 00:46:31.639
You should be, I don't know.

00:46:31.639 --> 00:46:38.199
Look at these horrible people who are not
at all connected with God.

00:46:38.199 --> 00:46:39.399
They have nothing to do.

00:46:39.399 --> 00:46:45.518
Yesterday that lady, she gives Me a lecture
that "Why don't you praise the Lord?," you

00:46:45.518 --> 00:46:46.518
see.

00:46:46.518 --> 00:46:48.219
She's giving Me a lecture.

00:46:48.219 --> 00:46:55.619
So it is just a sort of a assumption that
"I am something great" that makes you ego,

00:46:55.619 --> 00:47:00.199
but that is also a Maya, because you have
to learn.

00:47:00.199 --> 00:47:08.619
Ultimately, your ego breaks and you understand
that "Oh, a Humpty-Dumpty it was."

00:47:08.619 --> 00:47:12.179
Once you discover that, "I don't want to have
an ego any more."

00:47:12.179 --> 00:47:15.939
I mean there are some Sahaja Yogis who refuse
to do any work of Sahaja Yoga.

00:47:15.939 --> 00:47:16.939
I said, "Why?"

00:47:16.939 --> 00:47:21.559
"Mother, we are too intelligent and our intelligence
cheats us and we'll develop ego."

00:47:21.559 --> 00:47:24.189
I said, "Now this is an escape.

00:47:24.189 --> 00:47:30.629
It won't, Sahaja Yoga can never give you ego,
but will give you joy.

00:47:30.629 --> 00:47:32.629
If it is giving you ego, it's not Sahaj.

00:47:32.629 --> 00:47:34.858
It should just give you joy.

00:47:34.858 --> 00:47:40.608
Giving somebody to Realization or somebody
you're curing, somebody being kind, anything,

00:47:40.608 --> 00:47:42.828
it just gives you satisfaction and you enjoy.

00:47:42.828 --> 00:47:43.828
It's a fact.

00:47:43.828 --> 00:47:48.749
I mean, you have come all the way here, you
are playing such good music, all this.

00:47:48.749 --> 00:47:51.889
Now you learnt Indian style, I don't know
how.

00:47:51.889 --> 00:47:53.899
Anybody should be very full of ego.

00:47:53.899 --> 00:47:57.649
But no, in the Maya of your Mother, you just
enjoy.

00:47:57.649 --> 00:48:00.169
Maya should give you enjoyment.

00:48:00.169 --> 00:48:06.679
That's the best thing that this Maya can give,
and you can enjoy it so much.

00:48:06.679 --> 00:48:20.018
I think it is a very beautiful atmosphere
created by this Mahamaya.

00:48:20.018 --> 00:48:24.568
So you can enjoy each other, you can enjoy
My company, you can enjoy nature.

00:48:24.568 --> 00:48:31.778
Such a rapport, such a beautiful understanding
between everything else is there.

00:48:31.778 --> 00:48:37.509
Nobody is bothered as to who is higher, who
is lower, what is the position; how much money

00:48:37.509 --> 00:48:40.249
he has got or what he has got.

00:48:40.249 --> 00:48:41.919
Nothing, just you're all enjoying.

00:48:41.919 --> 00:48:48.119
If somebody has a talent, he enjoys because
he has a talent and the others also enjoy

00:48:48.119 --> 00:48:50.149
because he has talent.

00:48:50.149 --> 00:48:52.679
No jealousies, no rivalries, nothing.

00:48:52.679 --> 00:48:53.939
Somebody sings better, all right.

00:48:53.939 --> 00:48:57.088
They'll tell Me, "Mother, You know, he sings
very well."

00:48:57.088 --> 00:49:06.848
There's one fellow in Paris and he is, I think
he's a black, from the black side, because

00:49:06.848 --> 00:49:11.399
he has very curly hair, a very nice boy.

00:49:11.399 --> 00:49:14.729
So, suddenly, somebody came from Italy.

00:49:14.729 --> 00:49:16.768
"Mother, do You know he dances very well?"

00:49:16.768 --> 00:49:17.768
"How do you know?"

00:49:17.768 --> 00:49:18.768
"I've seen him dancing."

00:49:18.768 --> 00:49:21.068
"So when did you see me dancing?" he asked.

00:49:21.068 --> 00:49:23.799
"You know, you came to that program.

00:49:23.799 --> 00:49:24.799
I saw that."

00:49:24.799 --> 00:49:25.969
In a group he saw him.

00:49:25.969 --> 00:49:28.508
He just got hold of him, "You'd better dance
before Mother."

00:49:28.508 --> 00:49:32.769
It was so much, you see, so joy-giving, this
kind of thing.

00:49:32.769 --> 00:49:40.488
He saw him in some sort of a program where
they were at least two thousand people dancing.

00:49:40.488 --> 00:49:42.419
He picked him out.

00:49:42.419 --> 00:49:48.828
Now, he's from Paris, and he's from Italy,
and how his eyes picked him up and he brought

00:49:48.828 --> 00:49:49.828
him.

00:49:49.828 --> 00:49:50.828
"Mother.

00:49:50.828 --> 00:49:51.828
You'd better dance before Mother, must!

00:49:51.828 --> 00:49:52.969
You are very good."

00:49:52.969 --> 00:49:54.129
And he was.

00:49:54.129 --> 00:49:57.129
But you see I might have missed it or whatever
it is.

00:49:57.129 --> 00:49:59.738
And even if I'd seen it I may not have asked
him.

00:49:59.738 --> 00:50:04.298
But this fellow went down there, and he's
got hold of him and he out put him here.

00:50:04.298 --> 00:50:07.659
I mean, these things are so joy-giving, you
see.

00:50:07.659 --> 00:50:15.219
It is otherwise, in the normal course, what
one would do, come before Me and start dancing,

00:50:15.219 --> 00:50:18.939
whether know or not and try to show off.

00:50:18.939 --> 00:50:19.939
Normally.

00:50:19.939 --> 00:50:25.629
But the one who knows never brought like that,
"Now, come along" and in such an impersonal

00:50:25.629 --> 00:50:28.409
way he saw him and brought him.

00:50:28.409 --> 00:50:35.538
It makes no difference whether they're from
Russia, or from America, or from India.

00:50:35.538 --> 00:50:39.848
So all these differences which are skin deep
are finished.

00:50:39.848 --> 00:50:45.538
And I find everybody appreciates everybody's
talent, everybody, how he speaks and suddenly,

00:50:45.538 --> 00:50:48.308
you'll find someone say, "Oh, he's such a
gem."

00:50:48.308 --> 00:50:49.869
"When did you meet him?"

00:50:49.869 --> 00:50:51.659
"No, I've heard about him."

00:50:51.659 --> 00:51:00.129
You see, all this appreciation and all this
beautiful feeling for others, you see, is

00:51:00.129 --> 00:51:01.429
only possible through Sahaj.

00:51:01.429 --> 00:51:03.848
No jealousies, no rivalries, nothing.

00:51:03.848 --> 00:51:09.559
These come because of an ignorance, which
creates the Maya about yourself, also: "I

00:51:09.559 --> 00:51:10.559
am this.

00:51:10.559 --> 00:51:12.068
I am that."

00:51:12.068 --> 00:51:15.439
And then the "I" comes down like that.

00:51:15.439 --> 00:51:19.709
So all conditionings also can create a Maya.

00:51:19.709 --> 00:51:23.838
Many conditionings are there that "I am from
such a family.

00:51:23.838 --> 00:51:25.539
I am from such a thing."

00:51:25.539 --> 00:51:27.369
That all has to be stopped.

00:51:27.369 --> 00:51:33.679
So today's special day is this of New Year's
where they said, "Now, today's the most auspicious

00:51:33.679 --> 00:51:39.738
day to start something new," and this Mahamaya's
dissolving has to be started.

00:51:39.738 --> 00:51:41.808
Gradually, you should try to understand.

00:51:41.808 --> 00:51:45.508
Many people ask Me, "Mother, how did You do
it?"

00:51:45.508 --> 00:51:46.508
Forget it.

00:51:46.508 --> 00:51:47.508
It's Mahamaya.

00:51:47.508 --> 00:51:48.508
Forget it.

00:51:48.508 --> 00:51:49.848
How did I do it?

00:51:49.848 --> 00:51:51.768
Just forget it.

00:51:51.768 --> 00:51:53.308
That part you need not go into.

00:51:53.308 --> 00:51:54.419
Just enjoy.

00:51:54.419 --> 00:51:58.858
Just enjoy that you are in that Maya and you
are enjoying it.

00:51:58.858 --> 00:52:02.679
It's the best way to enjoy this Mahamaya.

00:52:02.679 --> 00:52:05.929
And today, for the first time, we have this
Puja of Mahamaya.

00:52:05.929 --> 00:52:11.989
Because of Gudipadwa, I thought something
unique must be done which encompasses everything

00:52:11.989 --> 00:52:15.058
of Sahaja Yoga, everything of Sahaja Yoga.

00:52:15.058 --> 00:52:22.409
It's not one incarnation, it's not one nadi,
it's not one Goddess, but all of it is there.

00:52:22.409 --> 00:52:32.358
It's sometimes I say like a film is audio,
visual, everything is there - drama, music,

00:52:32.358 --> 00:52:34.258
also acting.

00:52:34.258 --> 00:52:35.939
Everything is there in a film now.

00:52:35.939 --> 00:52:39.409
I mean that far, everything integrated.

00:52:39.409 --> 00:52:49.179
In the same way, I think Mahamaya has everything
in it: every part that you tell Me, everything

00:52:49.179 --> 00:52:52.679
that you enjoy, everything that you discover.

00:52:52.679 --> 00:52:57.758
Everything is in that vision of Mahamaya,
which has been created for you.

00:52:57.758 --> 00:53:00.261
May God bless you.
