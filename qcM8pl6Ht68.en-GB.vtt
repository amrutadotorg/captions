WEBVTT

00:18.822 --> 00:22.897
Navaratri Puja, Cabella Ligure, 24.10.1993

00:23.098 --> 00:27.496
H.H. Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi

01:44.160 --> 01:56.605
Today we have gathered here to do the Puja of the Devi.

02:00.032 --> 02:03.877
The Devi has many forms

02:04.078 --> 02:10.124
but is the embodiment of the shakti.

02:11.305 --> 02:19.173
Adishakti gives shakti to all these embodiments.

02:19.374 --> 02:26.087
And so there are many Goddesses we have at different times.

02:26.288 --> 02:33.587
They came on this earth and did all that was necessary

02:33.788 --> 02:38.595
for the ascent of people who were seekers.

02:38.796 --> 02:48.005
Specially the one we know of Jagadamba, the Durga.

02:48.566 --> 02:56.904
She was trying to protect all the seekers of truth

02:57.105 --> 03:05.193
and to destroy all evil forces

03:05.394 --> 03:12.052
because without the ascent of human beings,

03:12.253 --> 03:15.880
they do not know the truth.

03:16.081 --> 03:18.739
And that’s why

03:18.940 --> 03:23.270
whatever they try to do is a mental projection.

03:23.471 --> 03:25.606
And this mental projection,

03:25.807 --> 03:33.835
if it is not substantiated by truth, by dharma, it declines.

03:34.900 --> 03:38.144
In Sanskrit they call it glaani.

03:38.345 --> 03:45.348
When this glaani takes place

03:45.549 --> 03:52.564
then incarnations are born to solve the problem.

03:55.952 --> 04:01.603
In all incarnations of the Goddess,

04:01.804 --> 04:07.837
there have been, very much incarnated the satanic forces.

04:08.038 --> 04:14.712
They had incarnated and She had to fight them, with them

04:14.913 --> 04:18.407
and destroy them.

04:18.608 --> 04:23.430
But this destruction was not for the destruction sake

04:23.631 --> 04:27.500
that the evil forces are to be destroyed

04:27.701 --> 04:33.727
but evil forces always try to put down the seekers,

04:33.928 --> 04:38.133
put down the saints, try to harm them,

04:38.334 --> 04:42.740
sometimes even destroy.

04:47.203 --> 04:51.526
All these destructive forces

04:51.727 --> 04:55.674
do not come at the same time, normally.

04:55.875 --> 04:59.799
At different times is easy to handle

05:00.000 --> 05:04.893
but the aim of the incarnation is to save,

05:05.094 --> 05:07.877
to protect the people who are seekers

05:08.078 --> 05:11.236
because they are the most important people

05:11.437 --> 05:15.314
in the realm of spirituality.

05:15.515 --> 05:21.752
All others are nothing but dust, good for nothing, useless.

05:21.953 --> 05:27.502
If they are not seeking the truth in the eyes of God,

05:27.703 --> 05:33.066
they are just useless lives that have come

05:33.267 --> 05:35.863
and will be finished.

05:36.064 --> 05:39.347
They have no value and they have no dignity.

05:39.548 --> 05:43.878
They have no understanding of anything.

05:44.079 --> 05:48.612
So in the judgment of the divine love,

05:48.813 --> 05:51.339
we have two types of people:

05:51.540 --> 05:58.941
one who are seekers of truth and the another who are not.

05:59.142 --> 06:02.510
They may be good people. They’ll be nice people,

06:02.711 --> 06:06.362
they'll be doing us lot of good works: social work, this work,

06:06.563 --> 06:10.495
missionary work, every sort of work they might be doing.

06:10.696 --> 06:14.003
But if they are not seeking the truth then

06:14.204 --> 06:16.667
they do not come to that category

06:16.868 --> 06:21.657
where God has to incarnate.

06:22.657 --> 06:25.815
So try to understand the preciousness,

06:26.016 --> 06:30.062
the importance of seekers.

06:31.360 --> 06:35.727
And that’s what you have been – seeking.

06:36.282 --> 06:39.628
Very few persons,

06:39.829 --> 06:43.566
if you take the percentage, are seeker.

06:43.767 --> 06:47.027
Is very, very wee bit.

06:47.228 --> 06:49.761
But it's very important

06:49.962 --> 07:02.101
because, say, a one little part of gold

07:02.302 --> 07:08.880
is much more valuable than mounds of steel.

07:09.529 --> 07:14.562
In the same way, a seeker is much more valuable

07:14.763 --> 07:17.445
in the growth of spirituality.

07:17.646 --> 07:21.578
The whole universe was created,

07:21.779 --> 07:26.750
whole atmosphere was built,

07:26.951 --> 07:30.352
all the evolution took place for what –

07:30.553 --> 07:35.599
that human beings should know the truth.

07:36.725 --> 07:41.806
But in the modern atmosphere, it’s a very big curse – I think

07:42.007 --> 07:45.782
the greatest evil than all the Shumbha Nishumbhas

07:45.983 --> 07:51.790
and all that – the worst of all is materialism

07:51.991 --> 07:55.610
because materialism makes you gross.

07:55.811 --> 07:58.352
In your seeking also when you are rising,

07:58.553 --> 08:03.795
subtly that materialism catches you.

08:04.256 --> 08:07.740
I have been noticing this.

08:08.670 --> 08:11.633
When people come to Sahaja Yoga,

08:11.834 --> 08:17.930
right, they are going deep into themselves.

08:18.131 --> 08:21.258
They are understanding what I am saying.

08:21.459 --> 08:25.250
All the inner knowledge they want to know,

08:25.451 --> 08:30.023
what is called as atmagyan. Atmagyan means two things:

08:30.224 --> 08:35.711
the knowledge about the spirit and knowledge about yourself.

08:35.912 --> 08:43.021
All this they find out and they know what it is.

08:44.461 --> 08:52.417
This state is the state for which people have been doing

08:52.618 --> 08:56.029
all kinds of things: going to the Himalayas,

08:56.230 --> 09:01.396
meditating in the cold without much clothes on them,

09:01.597 --> 09:06.479
living in the caves with some fruits.

09:07.027 --> 09:09.678
All kinds of tapasyas they would do

09:09.879 --> 09:18.060
because the seeking was so deep, so urgent,

09:18.261 --> 09:24.191
and they could not get out of that force of seeking.

09:25.412 --> 09:32.421
But in the modern times, materialism retards

09:32.622 --> 09:39.819
that hankering, that dedication.

09:40.020 --> 09:46.475
It's maddening for people when they are seekers.

09:46.676 --> 09:50.592
I have seen before coming to Sahaja Yoga,

09:50.793 --> 09:56.553
people spend lot of money, go to various places,

09:56.754 --> 10:01.842
go to Himalayas, go to Nepal, go to Japan,

10:02.043 --> 10:06.347
all over the places they are moving.

10:06.660 --> 10:09.600
But after coming to Sahaja Yoga,

10:09.801 --> 10:13.709
after they have become the Spirits,

10:13.910 --> 10:20.631
for the growth of your new awareness

10:20.832 --> 10:23.904
the progress is retarded.

10:24.105 --> 10:27.295
Also one should understand that

10:27.496 --> 10:31.873
after so much of running about, you find something so precious

10:32.074 --> 10:34.154
so you settle down with that.

10:34.355 --> 10:38.662
And you feel very satisfied about it. That part is all right.

10:38.863 --> 10:42.365
But what later?

10:42.566 --> 10:46.370
Your growth should not stop.

10:46.683 --> 10:49.396
And that stops because,

10:49.597 --> 10:55.425
because of one of the main reasons is materialism.

10:56.800 --> 11:03.654
Because of materialism, your faith in yourself is also less.

11:03.909 --> 11:09.244
Now as you have seen that the Gods prayed to the Goddess

11:09.445 --> 11:15.812
and She came and killed all the negative forces.

11:16.320 --> 11:22.955
Reason was the earnest desire of the Gods

11:23.156 --> 11:27.228
compelled Her to take incarnation.

11:27.429 --> 11:31.587
Such sincere desire for ascent

11:31.788 --> 11:39.689
that they could not get sometimes food, even water,

11:39.890 --> 11:46.158
and they worked so hard for their ascent

11:46.359 --> 11:50.859
which was disturbed by negative forces.

11:51.320 --> 11:59.273
So their call was so from the heart,

11:59.474 --> 12:04.101
so desperate and genuine and sincere

12:04.302 --> 12:12.031
that the Goddess had to take birth on this earth to save them,

12:12.232 --> 12:18.083
to protect them, to look after them.

12:19.564 --> 12:23.801
But, as it is we see,

12:24.002 --> 12:28.778
once you have reached a destination,

12:28.979 --> 12:33.455
you feel now, better settle down.

12:34.221 --> 12:40.463
Now, what do you, we settle down with?

12:41.815 --> 12:48.973
If after getting realization you are complete,

12:49.174 --> 12:54.489
you are in totality, you are absolutely one with reality,

12:54.690 --> 12:59.315
there’s nothing to be done.

12:59.995 --> 13:02.216
You become a saint.

13:02.417 --> 13:06.599
And a saint does not need any advertisement,

13:06.800 --> 13:10.146
does not need anything. His message spreads.

13:10.347 --> 13:14.576
People see him and know he is a great saint.

13:14.777 --> 13:18.303
So many saints did not even leave their houses.

13:18.504 --> 13:21.225
A very common saying in India,

13:21.426 --> 13:23.561
“Your takiya you should not leave that,”

13:23.762 --> 13:27.920
the pillow on which you are resting, you should not leave.

13:28.121 --> 13:33.795
That was a criteria of a guru. Those who have to seek

13:33.996 --> 13:38.498
should come to the gurus and climb up,

13:38.699 --> 13:41.139
at least six seven miles up,

13:41.340 --> 13:44.944
and then the guru doesn’t meet anyone. He may slap you.

13:45.145 --> 13:50.850
He may hit you. He may drop you from that high mountain.

13:51.051 --> 13:56.248
He'll take your test by so many ways.

13:56.449 --> 14:01.264
Ultimately he may select one person to give realization.

14:01.465 --> 14:05.366
So this hankering, this desperate effort

14:05.567 --> 14:09.957
was all the time there.

14:10.911 --> 14:17.715
Now, so we come to Sahaja Yoga in these modern times.

14:18.634 --> 14:27.960
Sometimes I feel that not only Sahaja Yoga is very easy

14:28.161 --> 14:34.179
also it is extremely pampering.

14:34.380 --> 14:37.312
You know you have got realization.

14:37.513 --> 14:42.109
You all know that you are better than others,

14:42.310 --> 14:44.617
that you have got rid of so many problems

14:44.818 --> 14:48.469
and that now you have become master of your own.

14:48.670 --> 14:59.820
Then the responsibility that you have towards yourself

15:00.021 --> 15:04.703
and to your fellow men reduces

15:04.904 --> 15:09.797
because you feel very satisfied with yourself.

15:09.998 --> 15:12.283
The other day some Sahaja yogini rang Me up.

15:12.484 --> 15:16.601
I mean, they ring Me up for everything.

15:17.226 --> 15:22.080
She said that “I went to the doctor and he put radiation

15:22.281 --> 15:24.478
and they found I was pregnant

15:24.679 --> 15:27.314
so what should I do about the baby?”

15:27.515 --> 15:30.947
For such a small thing they will ask.

15:31.148 --> 15:35.166
“What should the name of our son?” “What is this?” “What is that?”

15:35.367 --> 15:40.867
I mean, I have to do much more work than any priest has to do.

15:41.625 --> 15:45.565
Little, little things they are worried about.

15:45.766 --> 15:52.737
All right, that part is all right that I have to tell you

15:52.938 --> 15:56.456
what is to be done at such a point or what should we do.

15:56.657 --> 15:58.706
If they miss the train, they will telephone to Me,

15:58.907 --> 16:02.347
“Mother, we have missed the train. Now what to do?”

16:02.548 --> 16:06.285
So I have to tell them, “All right, give them a bandhan.”

16:06.486 --> 16:08.808
That also I have to tell them.

16:09.009 --> 16:13.386
Or supposing their father is sick.

16:13.587 --> 16:17.135
He has a heart trouble then they’ll telephone to Me,

16:17.336 --> 16:19.963
“Mother, my father is sick. He has a heart trouble.

16:20.164 --> 16:24.166
He’s not a Sahaja yogi. What can You do about it?”

16:24.367 --> 16:27.090
So Mother has to put attention to his father

16:27.291 --> 16:30.742
who is not a Sahaja yogi.

16:31.695 --> 16:35.150
Small, small things they write to Me.

16:35.351 --> 16:39.322
Such small things that you can’t imagine

16:39.523 --> 16:46.601
how they do not understand what I am here for.

16:47.387 --> 16:52.803
Still, I have never said that it’s a stupid thing to ask Me.

16:53.004 --> 16:57.264
You should not waste My time, never.

16:57.465 --> 17:00.553
But it’s to be seen now

17:00.754 --> 17:07.240
that if you do not value yourself as realized souls,

17:07.441 --> 17:15.521
you can not value My time also or what is Myself.

17:15.722 --> 17:20.146
This incarnation can be wasted completely

17:20.347 --> 17:26.261
because of this materialistic attitude.

17:27.996 --> 17:31.912
In these modern times, I don’t know what's gone wrong

17:32.113 --> 17:37.381
with human beings because the most important thing

17:37.582 --> 17:42.279
in your life is to ascend and to grow.

17:42.480 --> 17:46.357
Take a big vision of the whole thing.

17:46.558 --> 17:50.435
Why this universe was created?

17:50.636 --> 17:55.740
Why you were created as human beings?

17:55.941 --> 18:00.896
What was the need to do all these things? For what is it done?

18:01.097 --> 18:05.013
If you have a very big vision of the whole thing

18:05.214 --> 18:08.857
then try to locate your position. “Where am I?

18:09.058 --> 18:12.068
And then, “How the Divine has selected me

18:12.269 --> 18:17.104
and now I have become a Sahaja yogi?”

18:18.035 --> 18:24.316
So now, “What is my responsibility?” that one has to see.

18:25.066 --> 18:27.599
But on the contrary,

18:27.800 --> 18:32.177
I have seen people who are saying have a transfer.

18:32.378 --> 18:39.247
So they’ll telephone and ask, “Mother, should we take our chair or not?”

18:39.448 --> 18:43.294
That shows they have no value about themselves

18:43.495 --> 18:47.435
and no value about Me, both ways.

18:47.636 --> 18:50.544
Because they are asking such small things,

18:50.745 --> 18:54.733
such silly things that is impossible to understand

18:54.934 --> 19:01.394
how could Sahaja yogis ask such questions.

19:08.450 --> 19:14.788
In the perspective we can see, the Goddess.

19:14.989 --> 19:21.835
She comes on this earth in different forms at different times

19:22.036 --> 19:26.577
to save the seekers of truth

19:26.778 --> 19:31.999
and to work out the ascent of the seekers of truth.

19:32.200 --> 19:34.718
Can you imagine?

19:34.919 --> 19:38.929
A very big difference in the incarnation

19:39.130 --> 19:45.562
of the Goddess before Kali Yuga.

19:45.763 --> 19:50.984
While now, it's a very different thing

19:51.185 --> 19:57.906
that you have come on this earth to become the Sahaja yogis.

19:58.107 --> 20:03.398
You have to have a body, a mind, feeling,

20:03.599 --> 20:08.421
everything which is just charged with spirituality,

20:08.622 --> 20:14.882
charged with your spirituality. Should be normally

20:15.083 --> 20:20.708
because how many years in the past you have been seeking God.

20:20.927 --> 20:26.960
Then, that you came here. What a coincidence!

20:27.161 --> 20:34.866
But, when, what is it? When you have such a great advantage

20:35.067 --> 20:40.414
that you have come to Sahaja Yoga because of your seeking

20:40.615 --> 20:45.766
and now you have found the satisfaction out of it.

20:45.967 --> 20:53.342
What is the responsibility that you have?

20:56.427 --> 21:00.468
That the incarnation Itself has come on this earth,

21:00.669 --> 21:07.234
not only to protect you, to nourish you, and to kill the demons. No,

21:07.435 --> 21:12.242
She has come on this earth to tell you about everything

21:12.443 --> 21:16.672
that is subtler inside

21:16.873 --> 21:20.399
and to tell you what should be your relationship:

21:20.600 --> 21:25.180
should be outside as well as inside.

21:25.381 --> 21:27.546
You were never connected with truth.

21:27.747 --> 21:31.335
You were never connected with this all-pervading power.

21:31.536 --> 21:38.200
You were never connected with God Almighty.

21:39.106 --> 21:41.894
So one has to understand that

21:42.095 --> 21:46.860
“What a great thing has happened that out of me only,

21:47.061 --> 21:49.454
this kundalini has come out

21:49.655 --> 21:58.137
and she has touched these higher centers.”

21:58.338 --> 22:02.590
How? This was not done before, no.

22:02.791 --> 22:07.481
They were just protected. They were just looked after.

22:07.682 --> 22:09.622
Nowhere it is written that

22:09.823 --> 22:15.369
“Goddess has given realization to people,” nowhere.

22:15.823 --> 22:19.479
She is responsible. She can give. One of Her names is that.

22:19.680 --> 22:25.432
Not one but at least ten names are that She gives you your nirvana,

22:25.633 --> 22:27.940
that She gives you your freedom,

22:28.141 --> 22:31.518
that She introduces you to liberty.

22:31.719 --> 22:39.499
All these things are written but what's happening now is that

22:39.700 --> 22:44.608
people have not yet been able to grasp

22:44.809 --> 22:50.441
the value of their life in the modern time.

22:51.575 --> 22:54.827
See the way people ask questions.

22:55.028 --> 22:57.866
See the way people, the inquiry is on,

22:58.067 --> 23:01.889
the way people are worried, “Now my child is big.

23:02.090 --> 23:05.178
What should I do?” What should you do?

23:05.379 --> 23:07.944
Child is big. Put him to school. Do what you like.

23:08.145 --> 23:12.913
“Mother, will you please tell where to put the child.”

23:13.114 --> 23:15.827
Then you put the child. “Have you seen the school, Mother?”

23:16.028 --> 23:19.085
“No, I haven’t.” “Then you go and inspect the school.”

23:19.286 --> 23:23.538
Imagine Kali Mata doing that!

23:23.739 --> 23:27.858
She would have given two nice tight slaps, I tell you.

23:28.059 --> 23:32.983
Anybody who would have said that, what do you make out of it?

23:33.184 --> 23:38.475
But to that detailed extent a Motherhood has to work out.

23:38.676 --> 23:42.975
You wouldn’t do that for your own child, I know.

23:43.176 --> 23:49.215
But when it comes to children, what are they doing?

23:49.574 --> 23:53.144
Still materialistic.

23:54.137 --> 23:59.475
Today specially it’s a very great day of Dusshera, they call it.

23:59.676 --> 24:05.178
This is the day when, as you know, Ravana was burnt.

24:05.379 --> 24:09.436
Effigies of Ravanas are burnt all over the place.

24:09.637 --> 24:15.475
When Shri Rama came this was done, His victory.

24:15.676 --> 24:19.647
But in His victory, it was not that He made Sahaja yogis

24:19.848 --> 24:23.475
or He gave realization, no.

24:23.676 --> 24:28.467
His victory was that He killed Ravana.

24:28.668 --> 24:33.897
That was done that time for today’s preparation.

24:34.098 --> 24:40.670
For today’s happening, it was done long time back

24:40.871 --> 24:47.169
that these days will come

24:47.370 --> 24:52.271
when people will have proper value system

24:52.472 --> 24:57.013
of victory of Shri Rama.

24:57.214 --> 25:01.237
But it doesn’t happen.

25:02.956 --> 25:07.122
It doesn’t happen because this incarnation

25:07.323 --> 25:11.927
of Mataji Nirmala Devi is very different, very illusive,

25:12.128 --> 25:15.615
Mahamaya.

25:15.816 --> 25:20.303
So you are left to yourself, do what you like.

25:20.504 --> 25:23.428
Whatever you like, you can do it.

25:23.629 --> 25:28.396
So they will ask Me, “Mother, we have a problem.”

25:28.597 --> 25:34.912
I said, “What?” “We don’t know which kind of chairs we should buy.”

25:35.113 --> 25:38.889
For every small thing they will refer to Mother

25:39.090 --> 25:42.327
but for important things, never.

25:42.528 --> 25:45.186
Sort of a funny use of the whole thing

25:45.387 --> 25:48.467
has started which is so great,

25:48.668 --> 25:55.014
so important is used for something absolutely nonsensical.

25:55.215 --> 25:58.741
So see the difference between the incarnations.

25:58.942 --> 26:03.491
One incarnation comes on this earth to save the people,

26:03.692 --> 26:09.152
to bring them out of the mire of maya.

26:09.825 --> 26:14.483
But another incarnation which has come

26:14.684 --> 26:18.944
is not only just to talk about it

26:19.145 --> 26:21.358
but to give you your realization

26:21.559 --> 26:26.684
and then to look after your small, small things.

26:27.668 --> 26:29.940
So when this lady telephoned and asked Me,

26:30.141 --> 26:35.570
“What should I do? Please Mother, cure me.”

26:35.977 --> 26:38.893
It's very different attitude.

26:39.094 --> 26:42.987
Between the bhaktas of those days and the bhaktas of today,

26:43.188 --> 26:45.760
there's a very big difference.

26:45.961 --> 26:50.073
I said, “You never asked Me when you did all that,

26:50.274 --> 26:52.878
doesn’t matter. Now whatever you have done,

26:53.079 --> 26:55.714
it's better I see the child, look after the child,

26:55.915 --> 27:02.071
put the child right everything but you come along.”

27:03.976 --> 27:09.157
But then I realized this woman is so attached to her child.

27:09.455 --> 27:11.824
And I telephoned to the leader and he said,

27:12.025 --> 27:16.306
“It's terrible attachment.

27:17.713 --> 27:21.332
It’s a terrible attachment to the child.”

27:21.533 --> 27:27.160
So now from one nonsense to another nonsense.

27:27.361 --> 27:34.426
This incarnation has such variety of jobs to be done.

27:34.627 --> 27:38.464
I mean, even the sixty-four kalas,

27:38.665 --> 27:42.964
the sixty-four expertise of Shri Ganesh

27:43.165 --> 27:48.055
is not sufficient to solve this.

27:48.806 --> 27:53.165
Why is it so complicated?

27:54.048 --> 27:56.214
After giving Self-realization,

27:56.415 --> 28:01.378
it should be a straight forward march towards your goal

28:01.579 --> 28:05.610
and towards your growth.

28:05.970 --> 28:10.363
But why is it that such a complicated nonsense

28:10.564 --> 28:14.595
is all the time bothering you?

28:16.783 --> 28:20.910
What do you want now? We should ask, “What do you want?”

28:21.111 --> 28:23.887
“I want a child.”

28:24.088 --> 28:27.817
After Sahaja Yoga, you should not want anything.

28:28.018 --> 28:31.778
Why do you want to have a child? There are so many children.

28:31.979 --> 28:35.775
You can look after them.

28:37.768 --> 28:42.973
“I want” goes away, should go away from your mind

28:43.174 --> 28:48.174
that “I want this and I want that.”

28:49.963 --> 28:53.236
This wanting is over now,

28:53.437 --> 28:57.624
what you wanted – your Self-realization.

28:58.039 --> 29:01.276
After that, what has happened is now

29:01.477 --> 29:06.094
what I want is more important.

29:06.532 --> 29:09.972
And I want that you should become really detached

29:10.173 --> 29:12.644
from materialism.

29:12.845 --> 29:15.652
That doesn’t mean that you should become like

29:15.853 --> 29:20.832
Hare Rama Hare Krishna no, no, no, no. They are not detached.

29:21.033 --> 29:23.027
They are very much attached people.

29:23.228 --> 29:28.535
But detachment is a state where nothing can bind you,

29:28.736 --> 29:30.918
nothing is important,

29:31.119 --> 29:35.246
most important thing is your spiritual ascent.

29:35.447 --> 29:41.777
Nothing can attract you more than this process.

29:41.978 --> 29:47.808
This is what exactly is wanted today,

29:48.009 --> 29:52.417
that Sahaja yogis should understand.

29:52.618 --> 29:56.767
Compared to what Sahaja yogi … compared to Sahaja yogis,

29:56.968 --> 29:59.259
what people have gone through.

29:59.460 --> 30:03.712
When I read it, I feel terrible.

30:03.913 --> 30:08.155
Here everything is convenience, convenient,

30:08.356 --> 30:11.671
come along, enjoy nice food, nice company,

30:11.872 --> 30:15.226
it’s a festival going on.

30:15.427 --> 30:19.976
Everything is properly done. And if something is missing,

30:20.177 --> 30:23.201
I’ll be the one who’ll tell the organizers, “What is this?

30:23.402 --> 30:28.073
You should have done this. You should have done that.”

30:34.634 --> 30:44.124
Now, we come to a point where we have to understand,

30:44.325 --> 30:48.348
what do we want?

30:49.747 --> 30:54.023
What's the use of killing Shumbha Nishumbhas?

30:54.224 --> 30:59.000
What's the use of killing this Catholic Church? What's the use?

30:59.201 --> 31:02.844
Because you are static.

31:03.045 --> 31:06.867
You are glued in one place, no progress.

31:07.068 --> 31:10.492
So what's the use of doing all these things all the time

31:10.693 --> 31:15.653
and destroying all that negativity.

31:16.404 --> 31:20.122
What is the purpose?

31:20.740 --> 31:23.195
It's too arbitrary. Everybody says,

31:23.396 --> 31:25.601
“Mother, you have given them permission.

31:25.802 --> 31:27.695
You have given them license.

31:27.896 --> 31:30.758
So now they are doing the way they are.”

31:30.959 --> 31:34.805
The other day, one girl came to Me. Her child was very sick.

31:35.006 --> 31:39.849
I asked her, “Do you meditate?” She kept quiet.

31:40.186 --> 31:42.626
I said that “I can make out that you don’t meditate

31:42.827 --> 31:46.064
because I know what it is –

31:46.265 --> 31:50.444
that you don’t even meditate.”

31:51.374 --> 31:55.923
So today’s main thing is this is a Dusshera day

31:56.124 --> 32:00.454
when the people go, cross the boundaries of their villages

32:00.655 --> 32:05.556
and bring gold for the parents.

32:05.757 --> 32:08.290
That’s the story, it is like that.

32:08.491 --> 32:14.220
Now what you have to do is to cross the limits of this materialism,

32:14.421 --> 32:21.384
this nonsensical dwarfy force that is working on you

32:21.585 --> 32:29.337
and you have to transcend and bring, as I said, gold,

32:29.538 --> 32:38.111
that is untarnishable thing from the borders of Sahaja Yoga.

32:39.861 --> 32:45.816
How many of you really are in the field of work?

32:46.017 --> 32:51.097
How many of you are telling about this to people?

32:51.298 --> 32:56.626
What are you doing about it?

33:00.910 --> 33:06.889
Why I’m talking to you and not to Indians this way

33:07.090 --> 33:12.350
because their attitude is different.

33:12.551 --> 33:16.928
Their attitude is not materialistic. It's spiritual.

33:17.129 --> 33:22.803
They want their spiritual ascent for which they suffer a lot.

33:23.004 --> 33:29.514
They’ll go out of the way to do things just to

33:29.715 --> 33:35.748
get to that state where they could be easily surrendered.

33:35.949 --> 33:39.365
This surrender state has to come.

33:39.566 --> 33:44.222
For example, you have a problem.

33:44.996 --> 33:48.445
Say problem, you have no holidays

33:48.646 --> 33:53.109
and you want to come for pujas, say. I’m just giving example.

33:53.310 --> 33:59.164
Now, if you want to come to puja, you just come.

33:59.365 --> 34:04.414
Not only you’ll get job but you might get promotion.

34:04.615 --> 34:11.281
But you have no faith in your ascent. You have no faith

34:11.482 --> 34:14.492
that you are the chosen one.

34:14.693 --> 34:20.794
This is what is missing because of materialism.

34:21.591 --> 34:25.453
Recently in America,

34:25.654 --> 34:29.883
we have a very great Sahaja yogi, Dave Dunphy.

34:30.084 --> 34:34.399
I told him, “Dave, you better take over as the leader of America

34:34.600 --> 34:39.485
because this gentleman is not all right and you better take over.”

34:39.686 --> 34:44.883
Immediately he said, “All right Mother.” Now, he lives in Honolulu.

34:45.084 --> 34:51.383
Our programs and everything are done through L.A., Los Angeles,

34:51.584 --> 34:54.672
and it looked quite strange that

34:54.873 --> 35:00.857
I should ask him to come down and work there.

35:01.834 --> 35:08.672
Now, where are we? We are the people who have been blessed

35:08.873 --> 35:11.656
with all the powers.

35:11.857 --> 35:15.851
You have been blessed. But we don’t want to practice.

35:16.052 --> 35:18.468
We don’t want to find out what powers we have,

35:18.669 --> 35:22.163
worried about our own children, worried about what sari

35:22.364 --> 35:26.710
we are going to wear, or worried about who is the leader

35:26.911 --> 35:31.887
and what should we do about the leadership.

35:34.544 --> 35:37.538
All these things are not going to help us.

35:37.739 --> 35:41.968
You are not here for that. Try to understand.

35:42.169 --> 35:45.906
You are here for becoming the spirit

35:46.107 --> 35:50.929
and then to spread the light of the spirit.

35:51.130 --> 35:54.093
Nothing matters.

35:54.294 --> 35:59.710
Once you start doing that, you'll be amazed, the faith works.

35:59.911 --> 36:03.967
It's not blind faith. It's not blind faith.

36:04.168 --> 36:07.835
You don’t have to tell Me even.

36:08.036 --> 36:12.371
It just works.

36:17.856 --> 36:20.530
It’s a matter of few days,

36:20.731 --> 36:27.710
you might get many results

36:27.911 --> 36:31.624
of what you have been hankering after,

36:31.825 --> 36:36.694
material, superficials, you might get.

36:36.895 --> 36:41.480
But the question remains.

36:42.161 --> 36:49.924
Somebody, say, wants to dedicate his life, so called,

36:50.125 --> 36:54.600
for Sahaja Yoga. Then what do you do?

36:54.801 --> 36:58.151
What do you do if you dedicate?

36:58.352 --> 37:02.432
First thing is your faith.

37:02.633 --> 37:08.080
You must know: how is your faith into anything.

37:08.281 --> 37:13.643
You really believe in it or you do not? If you do believe in it,

37:13.844 --> 37:17.836
what have you done about it?

37:19.547 --> 37:25.382
So at this stage, you have to introspect.

37:27.211 --> 37:31.549
What are you doing? What are we to do?

37:31.750 --> 37:38.385
How far do we have to go? It’s a very, very important time

37:38.586 --> 37:45.135
and you are extremely important souls here sitting down

37:45.336 --> 37:52.698
but if you don’t value your own systems and yourself,

37:52.899 --> 37:57.688
why should God worry about you?

37:58.672 --> 38:02.244
Why should God try to give you ideas?

38:02.445 --> 38:07.051
Why should He try to take any interest even in you –

38:07.252 --> 38:12.103
persons of that kind.

38:14.713 --> 38:20.379
So now, I have to just tell you that on this day of this Puja,

38:20.580 --> 38:24.832
it's such a combination that is the Dusshera, I am here,

38:25.033 --> 38:28.566
and also is the now we can call it, the last day

38:28.767 --> 38:33.467
of the Devi Puja. We have to see within ourselves,

38:33.668 --> 38:39.386
introspect, “What have I done for Sahaja Yoga?”

38:42.823 --> 38:47.309
Except for looking after my children, cooking for the husband,

38:47.510 --> 38:50.783
that’s all.

38:51.323 --> 38:55.958
Men can also think the same way, “What have we done?

38:56.159 --> 39:00.005
What have we done for Sahaja Yoga?”

39:00.206 --> 39:04.911
Just, I want to meet politicians,

39:05.112 --> 39:10.591
I want to meet this person, I want to meet that person. For what?

39:10.792 --> 39:12.997
They should come and meet

39:13.198 --> 39:16.075
you but your faith in yourself is very weak.

39:16.276 --> 39:23.677
I think that’s the main reason for all this fall is faith in yourself.

39:23.878 --> 39:31.474
This faith is

39:31.675 --> 39:39.589
such a thing that you know it is so.

39:39.790 --> 39:44.777
You have seen My photographs. You are convinced about it.

39:44.978 --> 39:46.894
There is nothing to be convinced

39:47.095 --> 39:50.878
but this faith is not one with your heart.

39:51.079 --> 39:58.198
It is not just with your being. It's outside.

39:58.399 --> 40:04.680
All right, Mother will do that. Mother will solve this. Mother will do this.

40:05.219 --> 40:09.807
But,

40:10.008 --> 40:14.745
whole thing is now to Me, looks like,

40:14.946 --> 40:19.307
that I have to compulsorily tell you

40:19.508 --> 40:23.867
to do some sort of a tapasya.

40:24.969 --> 40:31.721
You ask somebody, “Do you meditate?” “No Mother,”

40:31.922 --> 40:36.534
very plainly. “No Mother, we don’t.”

40:36.735 --> 40:39.487
“So, what are you doing here?”

40:39.688 --> 40:45.229
“My, there’s some pain in my knees so I have come to you.”

40:45.430 --> 40:50.729
All right. “But I don’t meditate. I am very honest. I don’t meditate.

40:50.930 --> 40:57.039
I just have some pain in the knees. Please cure it. I don’t meditate.”

40:58.516 --> 41:04.547
How many of you really meditate every night?

41:05.680 --> 41:08.292
Guido said that “Mother, if You tell like this they will say,

41:08.493 --> 41:11.269
“All right in the night we do but not in the morning”

41:11.470 --> 41:15.574
because Mother has said, “Do it in the night.”

41:15.775 --> 41:24.011
There’s no earnestness. There’s no

41:24.212 --> 41:31.324
expected any kind of a enthusiasm about it.

41:31.525 --> 41:34.621
All right, if not today, we will see tomorrow.

41:34.822 --> 41:38.317
Mother says like that “It's not necessary.

41:38.518 --> 41:42.536
It's not important. It's all right.”

41:42.737 --> 41:45.677
So you satisfy yourself.

41:45.878 --> 41:50.325
But who is the loser? Not Me. I don’t need Sahaja Yoga,

41:50.526 --> 41:52.341
do I?

41:52.542 --> 41:56.146
I am doing all the tapasya for your Sahaja Yoga.

41:56.347 --> 42:02.862
What about you people doing some tapasya about it?

42:04.003 --> 42:06.888
So now, what I am trying to say

42:07.089 --> 42:09.615
that you have got your realization.

42:09.816 --> 42:13.365
Now you have reached a great state of understanding,

42:13.566 --> 42:17.818
also of the inner knowledge and also about

42:18.019 --> 42:23.256
your connection with the spirit and with the God Almighty.

42:23.457 --> 42:25.975
All this you know now. Many things you know.

42:26.176 --> 42:33.904
Despite that, it's not yet what it should be from your heart,

42:34.105 --> 42:40.777
from your earnest desire.

42:42.574 --> 42:53.673
It doesn’t help at all any one to deceive oneself, never.

42:53.874 --> 42:59.525
So I am not saying something for x, y, z. I am saying for all of you.

42:59.726 --> 43:05.038
Don’t try to cheat yourself.

43:05.622 --> 43:12.038
You are here with such a great purpose.

43:12.734 --> 43:21.714
This purpose is corrective and is the freedom of our minds

43:21.915 --> 43:25.456
from all these nonsensical destructive forces

43:25.657 --> 43:32.258
and then to spread it all over, talk about it.

43:34.035 --> 43:41.506
My own conviction is this,

43:41.707 --> 43:46.576
that something has to happen to Sahaja yogis

43:46.777 --> 43:57.958
to realize how important it is to work out

43:58.159 --> 44:01.462
something that is within us, which is potential,

44:01.663 --> 44:05.353
which is just about to bubble up.

44:05.554 --> 44:09.681
It’s a responsibility, whether you are a Jew, a Christian

44:09.882 --> 44:14.673
or anything makes no difference. It is all outside.

44:14.874 --> 44:18.314
For what you have to do that you have come into

44:18.515 --> 44:24.103
a new realm of awareness, into a new realm of a higher life

44:24.304 --> 44:26.572
where you know all your inner self,

44:26.773 --> 44:30.877
you know all about what is good and what is not.

44:31.078 --> 44:35.627
Everything after knowing all this also if you do not grow

44:35.828 --> 44:40.101
then whom will you blame?

44:44.602 --> 44:49.823
So now we come to a point to understand

44:50.024 --> 44:52.932
the importance of this Kali Yuga,

44:53.133 --> 44:56.745
where your Mother is here to help you

44:56.946 --> 45:04.072
and also to look after you very tenderly, sweetly,

45:04.273 --> 45:07.400
to tell you everything.

45:07.601 --> 45:14.866
Actually I cannot get angry with any one for more than one minute.

45:16.056 --> 45:22.806
So, explain to you sweetly what you should have done

45:23.007 --> 45:26.822
and which you can do, which you have to do.

45:27.023 --> 45:29.845
All these things I would have really

45:30.046 --> 45:33.439
would have been telling you all the time. I have been

45:33.640 --> 45:38.041
bringing you round very sweetly and explaining to you

45:38.242 --> 45:42.087
and telling you that this is your own power which is within you

45:42.288 --> 45:46.087
and which you have to look after and raise it

45:46.288 --> 45:53.345
and also you have got so many books or ways of understanding that.

45:53.546 --> 45:58.853
But this inner knowledge which you have is something like this –

45:59.054 --> 46:04.712
that I have a inner knowledge about, say about,

46:04.913 --> 46:09.610
how to build these things but I don’t do it.

46:09.811 --> 46:13.119
Is as simple as that. I just don’t do it.

46:13.320 --> 46:19.163
I have the inner knowledge, all right. I have a Ph.D. but I am mad.

46:20.258 --> 46:23.476
It's like that.

46:23.946 --> 46:28.237
So many people mentally very well equipped in Sahaja Yoga, I know.

46:28.438 --> 46:32.370
But as far as the following of Sahaja Yoga is concerned,

46:32.571 --> 46:35.401
they are not there.

46:35.602 --> 46:40.409
So I am warning you now. It's like Christ has said,

46:40.610 --> 46:46.057
“Some seeds which are sprouted fell on the street and dried out and died.”

46:46.258 --> 46:48.041
Now the judgment is going on all the time.

46:48.242 --> 46:53.479
When I am talking to you, it's all the judgment is going on.

46:53.680 --> 46:56.877
So every night you have to meditate.

46:57.078 --> 47:03.971
And you have to then think about what have you done tonight,

47:04.172 --> 47:10.125
today, in the whole day what have you achieved.

47:10.930 --> 47:13.737
But so calculating they are.

47:13.938 --> 47:17.276
Supposing I go there at five o’clock

47:17.477 --> 47:22.878
then I have to be back at seven otherwise I will miss the point,

47:23.079 --> 47:26.566
I’ll not see this person, that person.

47:26.767 --> 47:32.777
So, everything works like that with the time,

47:32.978 --> 47:36.035
with the importance of nonsensical things.

47:36.236 --> 47:41.668
But what has to work is your faith

47:41.869 --> 47:45.082
that “I’m going to do things which are truthful,

47:45.283 --> 47:48.246
which are sensible, down to earth

47:48.447 --> 47:55.980
and I’m going to keep myself absolutely, extremely free

47:56.181 --> 48:02.957
and I’m going to look after not only my inner being

48:03.158 --> 48:06.801
but the inner beings of others.”

48:07.002 --> 48:13.418
Today’s special puja is really of, more of right side I would say.

48:13.619 --> 48:16.027
Dusshera is a right side Puja

48:16.228 --> 48:22.642
because you worship Shri Rama and his bow and everything.

48:23.189 --> 48:26.933
But think of these incarnation.

48:27.134 --> 48:29.511
Fourteen years He went to jail.

48:29.712 --> 48:34.675
For a particular reason, He went there.

48:34.876 --> 48:39.566
I mean, if somebody has to go even for one year, it’s a headache.

48:39.767 --> 48:44.409
It's not a jail but it's, we can call, in the forest that He went,

48:44.610 --> 48:47.675
it was like a jail to Him.

48:47.876 --> 48:51.863
He was a king’s son. He had no place to live, to sleep.

48:52.064 --> 48:55.480
Everywhere He went, He had to build His own little hut.

48:55.681 --> 48:58.371
So He went there.

48:58.572 --> 49:03.738
He had to do it. Why, why did He do it?

49:03.939 --> 49:08.293
Because He had faith in Himself. He is Shri Rama

49:08.494 --> 49:12.816
and He has to jolly well do these things. He had faith in Himself.

49:13.017 --> 49:16.527
And He had faith in God Almighty that whatever He’s doing,

49:16.728 --> 49:20.840
He is doing as a will of God.

49:21.041 --> 49:24.340
And that is what I have to do, finished.

49:24.541 --> 49:28.121
I don’t care whether I have to face Ravana

49:28.322 --> 49:32.816
or I have to face this or that, I don’t care.

49:33.017 --> 49:37.981
I am a Sahaja yogi. I don’t care.

49:38.182 --> 49:42.106
My job is to spread Sahaja Yoga, all right.

49:42.307 --> 49:47.754
My job is to cleanse myself up and know myself.

49:47.955 --> 49:51.207
This is my work, my job, and this is what I have to do.

49:51.408 --> 49:55.746
I am not bothered if I get admission in the school or not.

49:55.947 --> 49:59.590
I am not bothered if somebody has to go by plane,

49:59.791 --> 50:02.653
so he gets a ticket or not.

50:02.854 --> 50:06.989
You just won’t believe that you show your faith in yourself,

50:07.190 --> 50:11.262
you'll get the admission, you'll get the ticket,

50:11.463 --> 50:16.575
whatever you want is there. It's all there.

50:16.776 --> 50:19.630
You don’t have to strive for it.

50:19.831 --> 50:25.349
You don’t have to bother for it. It's just there.

50:25.550 --> 50:29.341
It is. I mean, all My life it has been happening.

50:29.542 --> 50:35.880
Of course My faith is, is like solid, like Gibraltar, no question.

50:36.081 --> 50:39.950
Because I know what I am and I know what I am supposed to do.

50:40.151 --> 50:43.325
So My, for Me I have no problem.

50:43.526 --> 50:47.458
All the faith and I know everyone and I can say that

50:47.659 --> 50:52.073
I can make out a flying bird.

50:52.714 --> 50:55.243
May not show that. Sometimes I may say that

50:55.444 --> 50:57.235
“All right this is good, this that”

50:57.436 --> 51:02.719
but I know for definite what I am and what I have to do.

51:02.920 --> 51:06.117
In the same way, you have to know about yourself

51:06.318 --> 51:09.672
because it’s a different category of people you are.

51:09.873 --> 51:12.891
You are not the ones who need protection from God,

51:13.092 --> 51:18.258
who need protection from the Mother, no.

51:18.459 --> 51:21.711
You have to give protections to others.

51:21.912 --> 51:24.438
It is you have to give light to others.

51:24.639 --> 51:26.860
You have to show them the path.

51:27.061 --> 51:33.024
So you are here for that purpose not for getting a house

51:33.225 --> 51:37.821
or a, what you call, income tax concession.

51:38.022 --> 51:40.594
You are not that for.

51:40.795 --> 51:43.219
All that nonsense you forget.

51:43.420 --> 51:47.336
Jolly well, they'll have to give you concession.

51:47.537 --> 51:50.625
I, I, I live like that, absolutely.

51:50.826 --> 51:53.188
I’m not bothered when I am traveling,

51:53.389 --> 51:56.911
whether there's a ticket or not, whether there is, what you call,

51:57.112 --> 52:00.599
a seat or not. I’m not bothered.

52:00.800 --> 52:03.380
I’m not bothered at all.

52:03.581 --> 52:07.338
All right I am traveling. I don’t even think I am traveling.

52:07.604 --> 52:12.455
I just think that I’m there. That’s all.

52:13.042 --> 52:15.489
So many things I say

52:15.690 --> 52:19.427
which looks so bombastic and looks so ego oriented,

52:19.628 --> 52:24.786
like I said that “This Catholic Church is about to finish.”

52:24.987 --> 52:27.231
I said that.

52:27.432 --> 52:35.072
If it was someone else they'll say, “Perhaps, maybe.”

52:39.626 --> 52:45.534
Now, so one has to change one's own language,

52:45.735 --> 52:52.386
the style and our understanding should be

52:52.587 --> 52:55.667
that we are a rough people.

52:55.868 --> 52:59.808
We are rough as far as ourselves are concerned.

53:00.009 --> 53:04.527
With others we are kind, tender, and sweet.

53:04.728 --> 53:09.058
But as far as we are concerned, we are not.

53:09.259 --> 53:12.824
Once it happened, we had a transfer

53:13.025 --> 53:16.019
and we went into a house, very big house though,

53:16.220 --> 53:19.308
but there was nothing to sleep upon. Or there was one bed,

53:19.509 --> 53:23.230
quite small. My husband was sleeping. He just can’t do like that.

53:23.431 --> 53:26.238
I said, “All right, take a challenge.” I slept on the ground.

53:26.439 --> 53:29.535
Next day, I had pain in the body.

53:29.736 --> 53:32.941
I told My body, “Behave yourself.

53:33.142 --> 53:36.136
Must learn how to sleep on stones also.”

53:36.337 --> 53:41.230
And for one month I was sleeping on the ground, still.

53:41.431 --> 53:43.683
So you have to be harsh with your body.

53:43.884 --> 53:46.782
You have to be harsh with your mind which gives you ideas

53:46.983 --> 53:52.751
of materialism or of retarding your progress in spirituality.

53:52.952 --> 53:56.587
Now, escapes, escapes they find out.

53:56.788 --> 54:00.298
Ultimately, you come to the last point

54:00.499 --> 54:04.493
where you do not think about, say, material life

54:04.694 --> 54:07.141
and you don’t think of mental life

54:07.342 --> 54:10.266
or so called these spiritual lives or anything

54:10.467 --> 54:13.711
but you think that it's all right, you are free from it

54:13.912 --> 54:18.195
and now you have become a very, very free person

54:18.396 --> 54:22.453
and you can do what you like. Supposing you reach a state like that,

54:22.654 --> 54:29.857
then you just say, “Oh, I’ve reached that state, finished.”

54:30.428 --> 54:33.416
How are we to believe?

54:33.617 --> 54:40.187
What’s the proof that you have reached that state?

54:40.742 --> 54:46.408
You must show. Doesn’t show but they say, “Ah, we are.”

54:46.609 --> 54:49.611
There’s a myth also in Sahaja Yoga that senior,

54:49.812 --> 54:54.525
he is a very senior Sahaja yogi. I mean, I don’t understand.

54:54.733 --> 54:58.908
What is this? How can there be seniority in Sahaja Yoga?

54:59.109 --> 55:03.484
Cannot be seniority. No question.

55:03.906 --> 55:08.057
Somebody is say, enters into the sea.

55:08.258 --> 55:14.362
Some are there for ages standing near the edge of the sea

55:14.563 --> 55:18.151
holding on to the earth because they are afraid to swim

55:18.352 --> 55:21.604
and some people who have come only yesterday might be jumping

55:21.805 --> 55:28.502
and going ahead and doing, enjoying the sea.

55:28.703 --> 55:31.403
So how is it he is the senior, he is the ...

55:31.604 --> 55:37.275
We do not have this seniority business in Sahaja yoga.

55:37.651 --> 55:40.919
There’s no seniority. And there’s also another myth.

55:41.120 --> 55:43.880
Maybe this is an excuse. I don’t know what to say

55:44.081 --> 55:46.341
but it is a very common thing to say

55:46.542 --> 55:49.529
that he is a senior Sahaja yogi or he is a,

55:49.730 --> 55:54.745
after all he is a senior Sahaja yogi.

55:55.605 --> 55:58.521
Can’t understand. Like saying a donkey,

55:58.722 --> 56:03.886
“This donkey is senior. Another donkey is not.”

56:08.338 --> 56:12.215
Then another thing that you suffer from very much,

56:12.424 --> 56:16.957
very common is this

56:17.158 --> 56:21.306
that “Mother said so.”

56:21.596 --> 56:27.856
Anybody will say, “Oh, Mother said to me, She called me and She said it.”

56:28.057 --> 56:31.176
“What did She say?” “Oh you are a very great Sahaja yogi.

56:31.377 --> 56:36.098
You are this. You are that. You are that.”

56:36.299 --> 56:39.332
Now there are two possibilities.

56:39.533 --> 56:46.298
One, I might have said it just to befool him.

56:47.546 --> 56:51.444
I am Mahamaya.

56:52.015 --> 56:58.142
Or maybe I must have said all this just to see that

56:58.343 --> 57:02.228
pamper his ego so that he gets to Sahaja Yoga

57:02.429 --> 57:08.119
and does something substantial than to eat My head.

57:08.320 --> 57:12.142
So, “Mother said so.” Such a great Sahaja yogi,

57:12.343 --> 57:16.704
I am such and such, very bombastic words,

57:16.905 --> 57:21.631
very bombastic language he would use.

57:22.288 --> 57:27.561
And then people, “Ah, what a Sahaja yogi.”

57:28.272 --> 57:32.798
So the judgment of a Sahaja yogi

57:32.999 --> 57:39.077
doesn’t come from what he claims but what he achieves.

57:40.460 --> 57:44.970
I have seen some Sahaja yogis are extremely arrogant also.

57:45.171 --> 57:49.173
Extremely arrogant, think no end of themselves.

57:49.374 --> 57:54.212
All that is there. So many Sahaja yogis I have seen of that kind,

57:54.413 --> 57:56.907
that they are very, very arrogant

57:57.108 --> 58:00.891
and that they try to make a big show

58:01.092 --> 58:05.219
out of what great people they are.

58:05.420 --> 58:07.563
Humpty Dumpties, as they call it.

58:07.764 --> 58:12.993
All right, but what a Sahaja yogi who is not like that,

58:13.194 --> 58:17.040
what is his style is?

58:17.264 --> 58:20.899
He'll just watch. He will witness the whole thing, just enjoy

58:21.100 --> 58:23.516
and laugh at what is happening.

58:23.717 --> 58:26.219
What is this man talking like this?

58:26.420 --> 58:30.078
What’s the sense of his talking like this?

58:30.279 --> 58:36.008
A person who is a Sahaja yogi is a gem.

58:36.209 --> 58:41.672
Is a gem and gem for which you take him to anywhere,

58:41.873 --> 58:48.193
to any place, people will say, “He’s a gem.”

58:56.013 --> 59:05.439
My own style is this that when I see a person

59:05.640 --> 59:08.697
or a Sahaja yogi anywhere,

59:08.898 --> 59:12.260
first thing I go inside Myself,

59:12.461 --> 59:14.229
first thing.

59:14.430 --> 59:18.096
I don’t know if you can do that. But I can.

59:18.297 --> 59:23.752
And then I see that person in a very different perspective

59:23.953 --> 59:27.432
and understand. Because all these powers are with you also.

59:27.633 --> 59:30.237
It's not My powers only. You all have these powers

59:30.438 --> 59:32.573
but the only difference between you and Me is that

59:32.774 --> 59:38.524
I have all faith in Myself and you have no faith in yourself.

59:45.241 --> 59:50.938
So we are at a crossing roads

59:51.139 --> 59:55.422
where we have to understand who will go higher

59:55.623 --> 59:59.586
and who’ll go lower.

59:59.787 --> 01:00:04.766
You have to find out who is the one who is going to achieve something

01:00:04.967 --> 01:00:09.873
and where am I compared to that person.

01:00:10.592 --> 01:00:14.073
Is said, “You have to suffer. You have to do this. You have to do that.”

01:00:14.274 --> 01:00:20.253
Nothing of the kind, by God’s grace. Nothing of that kind.

01:00:20.454 --> 01:00:24.469
So now what is it?

01:00:25.251 --> 01:00:29.691
What will happen to a Sahaja yogi?

01:00:29.892 --> 01:00:35.058
How will you know who is a Sahaja yogi?

01:00:35.259 --> 01:00:42.652
How will you know who is just putting a lip service?

01:00:42.853 --> 01:00:48.324
Only way is that you evolve. You become like a mirror

01:00:48.525 --> 01:00:53.847
and you see for yourself what sort of a person he is

01:00:54.048 --> 01:00:59.690
and also you see yourself, what you are.

01:00:59.891 --> 01:01:04.185
Today’s lecture is more, sort of,

01:01:04.386 --> 01:01:08.154
is actually absolutely inspired lecture.

01:01:08.355 --> 01:01:11.615
And it is the one that should tell you

01:01:11.816 --> 01:01:19.453
that all that we have done today is this to understand

01:01:19.654 --> 01:01:25.094
our own values about our own life.

01:01:25.295 --> 01:01:28.899
We should understand, “Why are we on this earth?

01:01:29.100 --> 01:01:35.193
What is our purpose and what we have to achieve?”

01:01:35.873 --> 01:01:42.391
You see, this I give you My all blessings from My heart.

01:01:42.592 --> 01:01:50.165
And I want you to accept My blessings,

01:01:50.366 --> 01:01:58.795
to be the great lights of God's desire.

01:01:58.996 --> 01:02:04.279
Try to understand what important time you are born

01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:13.840
and that you have  become such good, beautiful people of God.

01:02:14.041 --> 01:02:19.183
May God bless you!

01:02:32.278 --> 01:02:36.629
May God bless you!
