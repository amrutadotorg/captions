00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:09.810
It is such a blessings to have such a nice place where
we all can meet and do the work of God. Sahaja

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:32.210
Yogis have to remember that we are here to
do God’s work and whatever blessings we

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:42.320
get, these are just guidelines to know that
God is creative.

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:50.550
I think the London Sahaja Yogis are real,
really blessed ones, really blessed ones.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:57.750
The way they get one after another beautiful
places to live in. And, we all should be very,

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:05.250
very thankful for what God has been very kindly
suggested to us.

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:14.550
I came here in the afternoon just to see the
place. As I looked at these trees and the

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:34.730
garden and the flowers – all of them are
here specially, very specially to tell you

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:50.370
that God is creative. We have to learn a lot
through them: how they grow, how they expose

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:06.890
themselves maximum to the rays of the sun,
how they suck their nourishment – all this

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:22.340
is a great training for all of us. They are
absolutely entirely surrendered to God and

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:35.830
to human beings who are the epitome of this
civilization. So, it’s such a big thing

00:02:40.861 --> 00:02:47.861
that we have a place which is unbelievably
great and that we have to be very grateful.

00:02:53.580 --> 00:03:00.580
Count your blessings, count your blessings.
There are still so many lost, so many who

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:12.010
are going to be lost, but you are in the right
path. This is sort of an advanced payment.

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.981
[laughter]

00:03:19.981 --> 00:03:26.981
It’s so beautiful and so sweet but one has
to know, as I told you before, that we are

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:39.731
not going to stay in the ashram just to make
our life convenient and leisurely. That’s

00:03:39.731 --> 00:03:46.731
not the way we should look at things. If you
have to live in the ashram, we have to discipline

00:03:48.921 --> 00:03:55.921
ourselves. You have to better yourself, everyday
you have to rise. Certain rules and regulations

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:05.310
of the ashram must be observed. There should
be no idea of a democratic government where

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:14.020
everybody has a right to vote and can demand
what they want. On the contrary, it is the

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:22.580
great privilege that you are supposed to enjoy
the blessings. It’s a great advantage for

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:35.860
you that you are so fortunate to see these
things with your eyes open, that God exists

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:45.740
and He rewards. This understanding should
give you more and more courage and complete

00:04:56.911 --> 00:05:03.911
willingness to improve yourself. This is the
most important thing. Sahaja Yoga is of course

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:11.890
as you know is for your transformation and
an ashram is for your improvement. So, those

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:17.010
people who are going to stay here or those
who are going to visit here have to relatively

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:24.010
see how they are improving and growing. There
are many things which are going to come for

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:31.010
us. They look material but they have an atmosphere
of spirituality.

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:38.640
Try to settle down with yourself. Don’t
quarrel [It seems that Shri Mataji says someone’s

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:45.600
name but can’t make it out] He wants you
to be comfortable. After a month you’ll

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:50.131
get all the Sahaja Yogis who have to stay
here. We’ll sort it out and then they will

00:05:50.131 --> 00:05:54.820
be allowed to stay here. Till then we have
to see what people are coming from abroad,

00:05:54.820 --> 00:06:01.750
they must also have proper places to live
in. At the most a month, some people would

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:08.750
like to stay here, but some of you will have
to be here to look after them, to give them

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:18.480
all your help. Those who have car, who have
time, should come down here and start it out.

00:06:20.721 --> 00:06:27.721
We have to organize it on proper lines. There
are three Sahaja Yogis are coming across the

00:06:31.151 --> 00:06:38.151
oceans, and one of them also to stay here.
Try to make their stay comfortable. They are

00:06:42.831 --> 00:06:49.831
your brothers of great achievements, and we
have to respect them and look after them.

00:06:50.771 --> 00:06:57.771
I’m happy we have here from America another
great Sahaja Yogi. Try to help them. Whatever

00:07:03.971 --> 00:07:10.041
they need, whatever they want to do, they
want to go out – make arrangements, make

00:07:10.041 --> 00:07:17.041
it easy. If they want a car or anything, try
to help them.

00:07:20.341 --> 00:07:27.341
Secondly, you must keep it clean, look after
it. You have entered into another arena now,

00:07:30.641 --> 00:07:37.641
on another level where your own comforts should
not be considered, it’s the comfort of others.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.691
Now, you are at a giving stage. So, what are
we going to give others, you have to see.

00:07:43.691 --> 00:07:47.091
Not what we are going to have “Oh this is
not good, there’s no hot water, there’s

00:07:47.091 --> 00:07:54.091
this thing.” – all you forget, you will
not need anything.

00:07:57.950 --> 00:08:04.950
So many will be pouring down. Who else has
come for Guru Puja now? Apart from Herman.

00:08:06.031 --> 00:08:08.841
You have come from where?

00:08:08.841 --> 00:08:11.130
[A yogi speaks – inaudible]

00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:13.431
Oh I see, good.

00:08:13.431 --> 00:08:20.431
So, all those who are coming from anywhere
else, you see, have to stay. And those people

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:30.061
who want to look after them, you can have
turns.

00:08:30.061 --> 00:08:34.901
Now today is the … what is the date today?

00:08:34.901 --> 00:08:35.980
Yogi: Seventeenth.

00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:42.980
Shri Mataji: All right! Modi is coming on
the nineteenth, I believe. He’s coming on

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:51.580
nineteenth. Anybody who is going to organize
here, food and all that … Michael? Who else

00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:52.421
with you?

00:08:52.421 --> 00:08:53.941
Is David? Where is David?

00:08:53.941 --> 00:09:00.941
There he is. All right! So, I’ll give you
a check of thousand pounds which you can cash.

00:09:06.921 --> 00:09:13.760
Get all the ration and everything with some
girls here.

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:19.260
I’m not going to pay. You have money in
the bank. Now, don’t get upset. I see some

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.840
people frowning [laughter]

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:28.840
I’m not going to pay anymore now. Finished!
All right. So, we have money in the bank and

00:09:33.531 --> 00:09:39.380
that money has to come handy now. So, about
thousand pounds I would like to sanction.

00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:43.821
And, David you. Michael. Who else is here?

00:09:43.821 --> 00:09:50.370
All right. That’s good. So four of you put
together, you decide what you want to buy.

00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:55.840
And, some ladies you need here to help. Who
will be here?

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:56.740
Kay?

00:09:56.740 --> 00:10:03.740
Who else? Those who are free. You – two.
Who else?

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:13.000
All right for the time being. Two of you and
four of these boys. The rest of you should

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:28.830
not shift here, should not stay here. But
once, you see, these people are over, finished

00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:34.051
with it, then you can shift here. We’ll
see that. For now, we have two ladies who

00:10:34.051 --> 00:10:41.021
are willing to stay here and four gentlemen.
All right? At least till the Guru Puja it’ll

00:10:41.021 --> 00:10:46.880
be quite busy, I think, lots of people will
be coming. So, some more ladies who can spare

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:53.811
their time for these three-four days should
also raise their hands, I think, these three-four

00:10:53.811 --> 00:11:00.811
days. All right? Who else?

00:11:05.031 --> 00:11:05.281
What are you doing, Tanya?

00:11:05.281 --> 00:11:05.531
Tanya: I’m working.

00:11:05.441 --> 00:11:12.441
Shri Mataji: You are working, won’t be free.
All right. So about, say, three ladies are

00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:19.771
there.

00:11:19.771 --> 00:11:26.771
So, three and four – seven people. Till
the Guru Puja, we can manage somehow and then

00:11:45.281 --> 00:11:52.281
we’ll see what happens.

00:11:54.021 --> 00:11:56.200
Hello?

00:11:56.200 --> 00:12:03.200
It’s all right. It’s all right. [inaudible]
The children are [inaudible]

00:12:16.791 --> 00:12:23.791
So, those who are already here … who are
those who are staying here?

00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:32.130
You are staying here and who? John, you are
there – four of you. Four. Five. Five of

00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:41.830
you are here. Six? Six of you. Who is in Chelsham
Road now? What the girls are there? Michael

00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:51.760
you are not here?

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:58.760
[A yogi speaks – inaudible]

00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:05.950
No, I think you come along. Till the Guru
Puja, you see, you need here some people to

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:16.250
really do the job. You may go to sleep there
if there’s no room, if there are too many

00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:19.521
people. I think we can manage.

00:13:19.521 --> 00:13:26.521
Guru Puja is on the twenty-fourth only. So,
hardly there are three-four days. I mean,

00:13:28.021 --> 00:13:35.021
when will you go to Guru Puja? Evening? Friday
evening or Friday morning?

00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:40.090
[Yogi responds - inaudible]

00:13:40.090 --> 00:13:47.090
Friday? Friday. So, you see, hardly anytime.
Today is what… let Me see… Monday, Tuesday…

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:57.600
four-five days. All right. I may also shift
Myself. If the servants are here – no problem.

00:14:01.801 --> 00:14:04.130
They will cook for Me.

00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:06.630
But what the gas is working here?

00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:09.620
[Yogi responds - inaudible]

00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:16.620
Gas is not here. So, how do we cook?

00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:24.090
[Yogi responds – gas has been disconnected
downstairs… - inaudible]

00:14:26.210 --> 00:14:26.830
Is it?

00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:30.321
[Yogi responds – yes, I’ve had a look
downstairs]

00:14:30.321 --> 00:14:37.321
So, if you get the gas, then it’s very easy.
I can get the servants here. Then, I can shift

00:14:38.531 --> 00:14:45.531
Myself in a way. All right?

00:15:00.011 --> 00:15:04.881
If there are say, five people – you five
people and three ladies – they can cook

00:15:04.881 --> 00:15:09.861
for you, no problem, all of you. But gas you
must have. Without gas they cannot manage.

00:15:09.861 --> 00:15:13.330
The water is running there? Hot and cold,
both?

00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:15.051
[Yogi responds - inaudible]

00:15:15.051 --> 00:15:22.051
Just cold. So, how will you have hot water?
Is there an arrangement?

00:15:25.771 --> 00:15:29.651
[Yogi responds - inaudible]

00:15:29.651 --> 00:15:36.651
All right. So, gas connection if you can get
it tomorrow … is it possible?

00:15:37.621 --> 00:15:44.621
Yogi: Yes, I can get the gas connected as
well as I can get the hot water running.

00:15:49.141 --> 00:15:51.941
Shri Mataji: Without that how will you manage,
I just can’t understand.

00:15:51.941 --> 00:15:55.340
Yogi: They’ll have to do it tomorrow night.

00:15:55.340 --> 00:16:00.131
Shri Mataji: Yes, of course! Is there an electric
cooker here?

00:16:00.131 --> 00:16:02.301
Yogi: No. We only got one electric kettle
at the moment.

00:16:02.301 --> 00:16:09.301
Shri Mataji: No, you have to have the gas.
Otherwise it won’t work out. If they connect

00:16:12.021 --> 00:16:17.381
it tomorrow, the servants can come and start
cooking. In any case, I’ll ask them to shift

00:16:17.381 --> 00:16:23.911
everything here, whatever is possible - vegetables
and ghee and all that. Plus, I’ll give you

00:16:23.911 --> 00:16:28.421
money to buy rice perhaps we may need.

00:16:28.421 --> 00:16:35.421
So, about four people: gentlemen would be
five and ladies would be three. Five and three

00:16:38.671 --> 00:16:43.161
– eight persons. All right.

00:16:43.161 --> 00:16:48.121
As soon as the gas is connected, they can
shift here. That’s the point is. Gas must

00:16:48.121 --> 00:16:55.121
be connected. Otherwise, where will they cook?
You see, there’s no electrical cooker.

00:16:55.501 --> 00:17:02.501
Yogini: Mother, I’ve got a smaller electric
cooker – just two rings and smaller than

00:17:06.161 --> 00:17:10.301
oven. Perhaps it would be a start.

00:17:10.301 --> 00:17:12.391
Shri Mataji: Start, we can!

00:17:12.391 --> 00:17:19.391
Yogini: I’ve got it in the car actually.

00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:26.951
Shri Mataji: Is it? [laughter]

00:17:26.951 --> 00:17:33.951
Yogini: Because, we drove it from London to
Brighton but we didn’t unload it and so,

00:17:35.331 --> 00:17:38.980
we brought it all the way back but I couldn’t
understand why. [laughter]

00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:45.051
Shri Mataji: Now, what do you say to that,
[It seems that Shri Mataji says someone’s

00:17:45.051 --> 00:17:50.511
name but can’t make it out]. I was wondering
how is she got the thing… [laughter]. So,

00:17:50.511 --> 00:17:57.511
we don’t have to worry about anything whatsoever.
But still we’ll need gas thing, but for

00:17:57.951 --> 00:18:03.951
the time being it’s good. All right, you
shift it here.

00:18:03.951 --> 00:18:06.361
[Yogi says something – inaudible.]

00:18:06.361 --> 00:18:11.011
So, better do something with the gas also.
All right? Because without the gas, so much

00:18:11.011 --> 00:18:16.711
cooking cannot be done. Partly, as she said.
So, better unload the thing and put it down

00:18:16.711 --> 00:18:17.391
there.

00:18:17.391 --> 00:18:20.141
[Yogi says something – inaudible.]

00:18:20.141 --> 00:18:22.881
Gas, on your own?

00:18:22.881 --> 00:18:29.881
Yogi: It will be better if we had a gas man
there. [laughter]

00:18:32.381 --> 00:18:38.421
Shri Mataji: You better go and tell them,
“if you don’t connect, we’ll connect

00:18:38.421 --> 00:18:45.421
ourselves [laughter].” I tell you, so many
beautiful things happening. So, we have to

00:18:49.831 --> 00:18:56.131
have that hot water started immediately as
soon as the gas. So, tomorrow morning what

00:18:56.131 --> 00:18:58.151
time, John, you think you can do for the gas?

00:18:58.151 --> 00:18:59.591
Yogi: nine o’clock

00:18:59.591 --> 00:19:06.411
Shri Mataji: So, let him come here by nine
o’clock? Then, you go ahead with him, and

00:19:06.411 --> 00:19:13.411
get the man and get it done. All right. Douglas,
I know you can manage. Douglas is really a

00:19:17.261 --> 00:19:23.131
daring person. The way he has fought all the
TM bhoots, you see, they’re all literally

00:19:23.131 --> 00:19:26.881
frightened of him. [laughter]

00:19:26.881 --> 00:19:33.051
You must see today’s article in The Times.
Did you read? Horrible article. Did you see

00:19:33.051 --> 00:19:39.251
the… My God! You must see that. He was very
upset - David Krall. He came down and showed

00:19:39.251 --> 00:19:44.751
Me the article. It was horrible. They are
already trying to advertise it and do all

00:19:44.751 --> 00:19:48.651
kinds of things and, there’s somebody whom
they have paid perhaps for writing. David

00:19:48.651 --> 00:19:51.861
can tell you. David, have you got the article?

00:19:51.861 --> 00:19:53.141
[Yogi responds.]

00:19:53.141 --> 00:20:00.141
So, we are going to work on that. Horrible
article! He was very upset – David. [laughter]

00:20:03.041 --> 00:20:10.041
All right, he is going to get the photocopy.
Give it to Gavin. Give it to Gavin. Hold it

00:20:15.871 --> 00:20:22.871
with the prong. [laughter]

00:20:30.061 --> 00:20:36.661
So shameless and so fraudulent! It’s all
falsehood they are talking; absolute falsehood.

00:20:36.661 --> 00:20:43.011
So many people are levitating. Their guru
is levitating in the room. Everybody is levitating

00:20:43.011 --> 00:20:47.771
there, you see. All falsehood, they can disappear
in thin air.

00:20:47.771 --> 00:20:54.771
Yogi: It’s all Your work, mother. [Everyone
bursts into laughter]

00:20:56.401 --> 00:21:02.311
And, seventeen thousand people are following…
seventeen million or something.

00:21:02.311 --> 00:21:04.301
Yogis: Three hundred million.

00:21:04.301 --> 00:21:11.301
Shri Mataji: Three hundred million. All false.
All, I tell you, all falsehood. But, I tell

00:21:11.791 --> 00:21:18.791
you, these media people don’t understand
what they are up to. One has to write something

00:21:20.201 --> 00:21:27.201
to them that this all is false. Very disastrous!
Horrible!

00:21:30.011 --> 00:21:37.011
Yogi: Media is skeptical of it … enlightenment,
world peace. They had to have metal detector

00:21:40.111 --> 00:21:44.031
when they went to their head quarter. [inaudible]

00:21:44.031 --> 00:21:46.951
Shri Mataji: We have our own detector.

00:21:46.951 --> 00:21:48.011
Yogi: Yes.

00:21:48.011 --> 00:21:55.011
Shri Mataji: Isn’t it? With our detector
we found that you are devils.

00:21:55.131 --> 00:22:02.131
So, once we have this then it all came so
fast. Isn’t it? Doesn’t matter. So, you

00:22:09.331 --> 00:22:14.470
arrange the first floor and the second floor
for all the people who want to come. You keep

00:22:14.470 --> 00:22:21.470
the first floor for the ladies and the second
for the men. All right? Not the other way

00:22:22.730 --> 00:22:28.771
round. Because there would be many who would
be married with children. But most of them

00:22:28.771 --> 00:22:34.551
will be in Brighton – directly going to
that. But Jason, have you been able to receive

00:22:34.551 --> 00:22:40.111
their information about when they are coming,
how they are going, what place they want,

00:22:40.111 --> 00:22:41.181
how they want to be allotted?

00:22:41.181 --> 00:22:47.871
Jason: Some of them, Mother, yes. We have
the French people, most of them arriving on

00:22:47.871 --> 00:22:54.871
Saturday while some going directly to the
place on Friday. The Swiss people are arriving

00:22:55.730 --> 00:23:02.730
about 3 o’clock Friday afternoon. I think
also, the Italians are coming about that time.

00:23:07.161 --> 00:23:09.651
Phil Ward is in charge of organizing shuttle
and cars to bring them from the station to

00:23:09.651 --> 00:23:16.651
the seminar. The Swiss people and probably
the Italians also would like to stay here

00:23:17.541 --> 00:23:24.541
Sunday night because their flight goes on
Monday.

00:23:24.911 --> 00:23:28.921
Shri Mataji: Oh, that’s [inaudible]. Also,
you will be surprised that this is on your

00:23:28.921 --> 00:23:34.551
way to Brighton. So, even if they are coming
earlier you can give this address to them

00:23:34.551 --> 00:23:40.161
so that they can come here first. And, from
here you can take some sort of a bus or something

00:23:40.161 --> 00:23:41.411
to take all of them together.

00:23:41.411 --> 00:23:46.931
Jason: Yes, Mother. There’s a green bus
that goes from Heathrow Airport to Gatwick

00:23:46.931 --> 00:23:53.931
Airport that goes almost right pass the door…
[inaudible]

00:23:59.090 --> 00:24:06.090
Shri Mataji: But why not make one place for
them to meet first of all? Some of them are

00:24:12.291 --> 00:24:18.891
coming from the back doors also or what? Are
they coming from the Brighton side?

00:24:18.891 --> 00:24:25.891
Jason: Yes, Mother. Some of them. [Inaudible]

00:24:26.131 --> 00:24:33.131
Shri Mataji: But if they are
coming on a Sunday here or something, why
not they come here?

00:24:48.411 --> 00:24:52.251
Jason: That will be after the Puja. [Inaudible]

00:24:52.251 --> 00:24:55.980
Shri Mataji: So how many will be here actually?

00:24:55.980 --> 00:25:01.321
Jason: On Sunday night, probably about fifty
or so.

00:25:01.321 --> 00:25:02.251
Shri Mataji: Fifty here?

00:25:02.251 --> 00:25:06.090
Jason: Just for the Sunday night but maybe
there will be others ….[Inaudible]

00:25:06.090 --> 00:25:12.081
Shri Mataji: All right. So, for Friday how
many will be here?

00:25:12.081 --> 00:25:16.961
Jason: Not sure… [Inaudible]

00:25:16.961 --> 00:25:23.961
[Shri Mataji greets someone on the side]

00:25:24.441 --> 00:25:31.441
Yogi: Three Italians are coming on Thursday
night.

00:25:33.011 --> 00:25:36.011
Shri Mataji: Thursday night?

00:25:36.011 --> 00:25:40.401
Yogi: And Friday morning seven o’clock is
arriving a group with …

00:25:40.401 --> 00:25:41.701
Shri Mataji: Friday morning?

00:25:41.701 --> 00:25:45.891
Yogi: Friday morning. And they want to stay
in the Ashram. I’ll bring them here.

00:25:45.891 --> 00:25:51.211
Shri Mataji: All right. So, keep it Thursday.
Say so from … it’s going to be on. But

00:25:51.211 --> 00:25:55.581
I mean gas has to be there. As soon as gas
is there I can shift here. No problem. But

00:25:55.581 --> 00:26:02.581
gas has to be here. I’ll bring the servants
also with Me.

00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:08.931
But after the Puja, after the thing Sunday
we should find out exactly how many people

00:26:08.931 --> 00:26:12.671
are coming here, because Sunday night food
can be cooked here for them. Isn’t it? And,

00:26:12.671 --> 00:26:15.331
they go on Monday morning?

00:26:15.331 --> 00:26:16.331
Yogi: Yes, Mother.

00:26:16.331 --> 00:26:23.331
Shri Mataji: That’s it. So, we can arrange
that also. It could be arranged very clearly.

00:26:25.641 --> 00:26:32.641
Nick, you have got this van till tomorrow?

00:26:37.701 --> 00:26:44.701
Nick: Yes, Mother. I should be able to extend
it. [Inaudible]

00:26:48.641 --> 00:26:50.141
Shri Mataji: All right. So tomorrow, why don’t
you send the van to Me?

00:26:50.141 --> 00:26:50.611
Nick: Yes, Mother.

00:26:50.611 --> 00:26:53.151
Shri Mataji: All right. Then, we’ll extend
it. I’ll pay for the extension.

00:26:53.151 --> 00:26:55.171
Nick : There’s no need for that, Mother.

00:26:55.171 --> 00:27:01.011
Shri Mataji: No, no, no. One day, I’ll pay
for it. All right? So, you send the van tomorrow

00:27:01.011 --> 00:27:08.011
to Me and then extend it. Hmm? Yes, tomorrow
if you send Me the van, I can send Debbie,

00:27:08.111 --> 00:27:14.041
and if the gas is fixed, they can start cooking
here. Even for… I mean you can cook for

00:27:14.041 --> 00:27:18.720
few people on that but ten people I don’t
know.

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:20.970
Yogini responds [Inaudble]

00:27:20.970 --> 00:27:27.970
Shri Mataji: Best is to have

00:28:00.871 --> 00:28:07.871
the gas, you see.

00:28:22.590 --> 00:28:29.590
He has given birth. Hello! He has given birth.
I mean not he. [laughter] His wife has given

00:29:14.611 --> 00:29:21.611
birth to a baby boy and you know they had
very bad time with the twins that they had.

00:29:21.730 --> 00:29:27.761
It’s horrible. Tenants had an effect on
the baby and the thing was delayed by about

00:29:27.761 --> 00:29:34.761
one week but the baby is very healthy – nine
pound something and I have given him the name

00:29:35.141 --> 00:29:42.141
Janak - Janaka. I hope you are happy with
the name. He’s a very sweet baby. All right.

00:29:44.921 --> 00:29:51.921
Now, those who are coming from outside like
... are you come from Northampton, Southampton?

00:29:53.691 --> 00:30:00.691
Who else? All of you. Where are you staying
now? Where are you staying tonight? You’ll

00:30:05.861 --> 00:30:12.861
go back? You won’t come here? I mean, you
are not going to stay till Guru Puja? You

00:30:16.850 --> 00:30:18.720
want to stay here?

00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:23.281
[Yogi response inaudible]

00:30:23.281 --> 00:30:30.281
All right. All right, you’ll go back to
Southampton and then you will come. So, how

00:30:35.391 --> 00:30:42.391
are you? How is your wife? Same? So, she is
here or in Spain?

00:30:46.671 --> 00:30:51.600
[Yogi response inaudible]

00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:58.581
She is in Cambridge. How is the baby? He’ll
come round.

00:30:58.581 --> 00:31:05.581
Boghdan, how are you? How is your wife?

00:31:16.991 --> 00:31:23.991
So, for you four-five people who are staying
here after getting the gas, you see – after

00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:32.071
getting the gas, again I say, you come and
see Me tomorrow. Someone having any problem

00:31:32.071 --> 00:31:39.071
over here you better stay with Me for the
time being till we get gas. What about his

00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:48.760
food? Let him in Chelsham Road, I think till
then. If we get the gas tomorrow then there’s

00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:54.691
no problem, you see. Then we will call you
from Chelsham Road. All right? Let him be

00:31:54.691 --> 00:31:56.861
there at Chelsham Road. Who’s at Chelsham
Road now?

00:31:56.861 --> 00:32:01.530
All right, Graham [We are not sure if Shri
Mataji says Graham or not] you are organizing

00:32:01.530 --> 00:32:08.530
there. So, look after him. And, if we get
the gas tomorrow then he can shift here. All

00:32:13.661 --> 00:32:15.220
right?

00:32:15.220 --> 00:32:22.220
How are you? All right? You wrote a very nice
letter to that man, that newspaper fellow.

00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:38.480
Horrible. Just imagine I never even asked
anybody to take out the coat or anything.

00:32:38.621 --> 00:32:45.621
In general way I said you take out your coats.
They have objection even for that. Can you

00:32:46.740 --> 00:32:53.740
meditate with your raincoat on you? Absurd,
I tell you! How can these newspaper people

00:32:54.240 --> 00:33:01.240
be so stupid to write all that? I can’t
understand.

00:33:02.111 --> 00:33:09.111
Yogini; Mother, sorry to interrupt You. There’s
been a very funny new development, because

00:33:14.861 --> 00:33:21.861
this horrible man’s name has appeared in
the newspaper again. In Brighton, this horrible

00:33:23.591 --> 00:33:30.591
nudist beach which makes us so sick, we heard
some very good news. By Your Grace, they want

00:33:35.181 --> 00:33:38.371
to take away the nudist beach.

00:33:38.371 --> 00:33:40.460
Shri Mataji: Nudist?

00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:47.460
Yogini: The horrible naked beach they want
to take away. But, the man who would not take

00:33:57.141 --> 00:34:04.141
off his shoes before You, has written to the
newspaper saying “Nudist beach is very good,

00:34:12.111 --> 00:34:16.601
everyone should take out all their clothes.”

00:34:16.601 --> 00:34:23.601
Shri Mataji: Except for the raincoat! Look
at this stupidity! [laughter] Now, what do

00:34:27.101 --> 00:34:29.490
you say to these real stupid people, you know.

00:34:29.490 --> 00:34:33.720
Why not write a strong letter to editor of
this?

00:34:33.720 --> 00:34:35.430
[Yogi response inaudible]

00:34:35.430 --> 00:34:42.430
Why do they give him so much importance? Who
is he? He is the Managing Director of what

00:34:45.730 --> 00:34:46.871
company? Better…

00:34:46.871 --> 00:34:48.591
[Yogi response inaudible]

00:34:48.591 --> 00:34:55.591
Better write to them. All of you should do
it. Stupid fellow! Stupid people live here,

00:35:05.561 --> 00:35:12.561
I tell you. What were you saying? John was
telling Me something about you.

00:35:15.190 --> 00:35:22.190
Yes, you communicated something to John? John,
didn’t you say?

00:35:25.121 --> 00:35:29.540
[Yogi response inaudible]

00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:31.010
Paste?

00:35:31.010 --> 00:35:35.440
[Yogi response inaudible]

00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:41.601
That is sandalwood paste to be made with a
stone, that one. John, you know what he told

00:35:41.601 --> 00:35:48.601
Me he wants to know the name of the stone
that is to sit on his head. [laughter]

00:35:49.381 --> 00:35:53.220
I said, “Stone!” I mean I’m quite strange
but not to that extent. [laughter]

00:35:53.220 --> 00:36:00.220
I couldn’t understand. I’m sorry for that.
All right, this is the stone I was saying

00:36:00.801 --> 00:36:07.160
or any stone like this, anyone which you can
rub. This is the thing – chandan, you can

00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:09.601
put it. [Shri Mataji talks in the side]

00:36:09.601 --> 00:36:16.601
All right. So, with just this thing I said,that
on the stone is I’m rubbing it. Show him

00:36:28.631 --> 00:36:31.601
that, Gavin.

00:36:31.601 --> 00:36:38.601
Because of the heat, you see. Chandan is the
best for heat. If you get blisters due to

00:36:49.210 --> 00:36:56.210
heat or anything – just rub this and put
it on the thing – very good. Have you heard

00:37:04.410 --> 00:37:08.150
of any famous astrologer called M. K. Gandhi,
anyone of you?

00:37:08.150 --> 00:37:10.851
Yogi: Yes.

00:37:10.851 --> 00:37:17.851
Shri Mataji: Have you? I’ve never heard.

00:37:20.290 --> 00:37:27.290
Yogi: I’m sure I’ve seen his advertisements.

00:37:29.730 --> 00:37:36.730
Shri Mataji: He’s telling others good things
about Me.

00:37:39.561 --> 00:37:46.561
That’s Athena. Athena, now, what’s happening?
Now, slowly. What happened? One chana. I only

00:37:55.780 --> 00:38:02.780
had three of them just now. All right, how
many do you want? As soon as I eat the chana,

00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:12.440
the Ganas are standing there. [laughter]

00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:19.440
The Ganas are waiting to have some. That’s
their share. All right.

00:38:30.091 --> 00:38:37.091
Now, we will have the puja and then we will
have more chana. All right, sit down. It’s

00:39:10.940 --> 00:39:17.940
all right.

00:39:22.030 --> 00:39:29.030
[Yogi says something – inaudible]

00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:46.690
Have you read the letter of Patrick?

00:39:46.690 --> 00:39:53.690
What can I say? Very uncertain. Only good
news is that one Mr. Marwah who was going

00:40:06.690 --> 00:40:13.690
to do all our publicity work has been elected
as the Mayor, Mayor of Los Angeles. That’s

00:40:16.101 --> 00:40:23.101
a very big news and this may do something
good, I think. So, first I’m going to do

00:40:24.061 --> 00:40:28.500
all this in Los Angeles. Actually, I’ll
go to New York only to meet the Sahaja Yogis

00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:35.270
there. And, then I will… as the program
is… you know the program, everything…

00:40:35.270 --> 00:40:41.990
I’m happy you could come because they are
really worried about American tour. How they

00:40:41.990 --> 00:40:48.990
will take it, whether it will be successful
or not? It will be!

00:40:50.390 --> 00:40:57.390
Lets look at these nice Yogis people… just
look at them. Not worse person has seen them

00:41:01.341 --> 00:41:08.341
levited. But they are telling all lies, you
see. “There is very much better coordination

00:41:11.130 --> 00:41:18.061
of the body and the mind.” Can you believe
such a false story?

00:41:18.061 --> 00:41:25.061
So, I told him that you should meet this Dr.
Fredick or what was his name? Fredick? Ah,

00:41:25.321 --> 00:41:30.530
Frenny. You go and see him. Show him this
article. You should say that we all want to

00:41:30.530 --> 00:41:36.390
protest. He himself will be very happy. That
this is how he is going to cheat us, he is

00:41:36.390 --> 00:41:42.290
fraudulent. And, why not we all put together?
Write a letter to the editor that, “You

00:41:42.290 --> 00:41:49.290
have no business to publicize such a person
who has ruined the lives of so many.”

00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:57.140
Have you got that article of Madhu Dave…
Madhu Jain?

00:42:01.611 --> 00:42:04.321
[Yogi response inaudible.]

00:42:04.321 --> 00:42:11.321
Activities in India… six thousand crores,
ah? And, what David Praul told Me is this

00:42:16.260 --> 00:42:22.081
that so much has been written against him
but there is no mention of it. So, you take

00:42:22.081 --> 00:42:28.930
David Praul, you and Frenny and all these
people put together. Make a very strong letter

00:42:28.930 --> 00:42:35.311
about it and let Dr. Frenny put it in. And
say, there are people here who can really…

00:42:35.311 --> 00:42:42.311
thousands of people who can say what I’m
saying. Get hold of him.

00:42:48.371 --> 00:42:55.371
The doctor friend of Rustom, did you contact
him? John, did you give him the address of

00:42:55.690 --> 00:43:02.690
the doctor? Did you tell them about it? I
think Pamela was there. Pamela?

00:43:05.341 --> 00:43:06.480
[Pamela response inaudible]

00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:13.480
What about that doctor? Did you tell him that
he should come for the Puja? Then what did

00:43:14.801 --> 00:43:16.210
he say?

00:43:16.210 --> 00:43:18.331
[Pamela response inaudible]

00:43:18.331 --> 00:43:21.150
What did he say?

00:43:21.150 --> 00:43:23.260
[Pamela response inaudible]

00:43:23.260 --> 00:43:30.260
Hmm… See, all such like that Di, Lady Di
or whoever she is… how is she now?

00:43:35.130 --> 00:43:40.831
[Yogi response inaudible]

00:43:40.831 --> 00:43:47.230
So, why not take her help also in writing.
Now, you see, Warren is coming, all these

00:43:47.230 --> 00:43:52.720
people are coming – you can all put facts
together. See this Dr. Frenny – all of you.

00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:57.480
And, tell him what he’s doing and what sort
of trouble he has given to others and how

00:43:57.480 --> 00:44:03.311
he has taken the money. You go and tell him
very strongly. You, especially, we have to

00:44:03.311 --> 00:44:09.101
save others now. It’s very important. Another
thing he says that Atlanta someplace somewhere

00:44:09.101 --> 00:44:13.650
has all people have become very peaceful.
Naturally, if you make somebody into a cabbage

00:44:13.650 --> 00:44:20.650
they will be. But the majority of the people,
I mean the greater percentage of the people

00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:29.640
who are in Ireland and who are in Israel have
become much more violent. One percent in Ireland

00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:44.200
and three percent in Israel. And, you see,
how they are behaving. So, this Atlanta we

00:44:47.351 --> 00:44:52.101
cannot find out but what about these two places?

00:44:52.101 --> 00:44:56.720
This Madhu… if you get his thing you can
write down. He says that wherever his ashrams

00:44:56.720 --> 00:45:03.720
are nothing grows. Even the cows become barren.
Or you can ask Murray how it was published.

00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:20.390
It was sent to us, I think.

00:45:20.390 --> 00:45:24.500
Yogi: Murray has that?

00:45:24.500 --> 00:45:31.500
Shri Mataji: Murray has that so ask Murray
to help you there. All right? Now, one thing

00:45:33.430 --> 00:45:40.430
you can catch on him which you can play about
to say that he is anti-Christ. Whatever he

00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:48.851
preaches is anti-Christ. Because he leads
a life of licentiousness? himself and you

00:45:48.851 --> 00:45:53.140
can give the example of Linda’s things that
was written. She has written it down. Then

00:45:53.140 --> 00:45:58.321
he himself is making money out of us and has
got all the material things of the world at

00:45:58.321 --> 00:46:05.321
the cost of his disciples. He is an anti-Christ
and there is no relationship of his work with

00:46:11.220 --> 00:46:18.061
Christ, first of all. And, secondly you can
also put Karpur Gaurav and all that are actually

00:46:18.061 --> 00:46:21.190
the worship of I think Shiva or something.

00:46:21.190 --> 00:46:28.190
[Shri Mataji asks someone in Hindi is the
Karpur Gaurav mantra is for Shivji or not.]

00:46:46.450 --> 00:46:53.450
It is the Shiva’s worship. So, what they
tell them is the idol worship of Shiva – put

00:46:55.290 --> 00:47:02.290
it down. But because they don’t know any
Sanskrit they go on saying. All right? Modi

00:47:03.111 --> 00:47:09.581
will be coming, he will give you the complete
shloka. It’s Shiva’s worship. So, that

00:47:09.581 --> 00:47:12.601
will go in the Christian mind here.

00:47:12.601 --> 00:47:19.601
Then, another good news is: Rustom has said
that in the Koran there is a description of

00:47:23.990 --> 00:47:30.460
Kundalini. They call it Assas and that at
the resurrection time, the Kundalini will

00:47:30.460 --> 00:47:36.510
be awakened by Mahdi. It’s all there. So
many things in the Koran, he was saying that

00:47:36.510 --> 00:47:43.510
there are seven heavens, firmaments, through
which human beings has to pass, one has to

00:47:44.740 --> 00:47:46.500
ascend through this.

00:47:46.500 --> 00:47:51.851
But I was reading a book given to Me by one
of the Sahaja Yogis in Brighton. It’s very

00:47:51.851 --> 00:47:58.851
clearly said in that there are angels of the
Mother and angels of the heavens and then

00:48:03.990 --> 00:48:10.990
seven of them and seven of these and everything.
And, according to My calculation it is describing

00:48:12.581 --> 00:48:19.581
Monday as the sabbath - Monday. Because as
you go you see, the Creator is on the third

00:48:20.740 --> 00:48:27.170
day or second day. It should be on the third
day. It’s the second day. First is the angel

00:48:27.170 --> 00:48:34.170
of the joy. And, that is Shiva. So, it is
Monday. Like that. Very clearly. And it is

00:48:34.390 --> 00:48:38.410
all written down, it’s preserved, and they
have just taken it out and translated. Can

00:48:38.410 --> 00:48:43.260
you imagine? We have got now the scriptures
to go with. Those books are with Me – two

00:48:43.260 --> 00:48:48.780
of them. Can you get those books for Me, from
some shop?

00:48:48.780 --> 00:48:55.780
Who game Me that book? You gave Me, yes!

00:48:56.410 --> 00:48:58.960
[Yogi response inaudible]

00:48:58.960 --> 00:49:02.351
Only through your University?

00:49:02.351 --> 00:49:04.900
[Yogi response inaudible]

00:49:04.900 --> 00:49:11.900
You can? So, can you, two-three people buy
that and go through it. And, you’ll be amazed.

00:49:13.341 --> 00:49:20.341
I mean, that’s the real Bible, you can say,
about Christ. Even the Bible, which is written

00:49:26.361 --> 00:49:30.571
now about the ten commandments, everything
this is related. Because that’s the original

00:49:30.571 --> 00:49:37.571
one they found Out. Can you imagine? And,
these laws that were written in Bible at the

00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:47.960
time of Moses, which are called Shariat in
the Islamic religion, are because the people

00:49:47.980 --> 00:49:54.890
had become so bad, so bad that they had to
put such terrible, strict laws that anybody

00:49:54.890 --> 00:50:01.071
does that must be cut – his throat must
be cut, his hands must be cut, legs must be

00:50:01.071 --> 00:50:07.140
cut. All this is only because of these things
happening in those days. The people were so

00:50:07.140 --> 00:50:11.361
bad, so much on the decline that they had
to change all that and they started this.

00:50:11.361 --> 00:50:18.361
This is very clearly written there. Better
get those two books and prepare it in that

00:50:19.630 --> 00:50:24.390
line. It will be good idea.

00:50:24.390 --> 00:50:31.390
All right. You want to wash My feet? This
water – you can wash My feet. You go around
