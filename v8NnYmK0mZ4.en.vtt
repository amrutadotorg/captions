WEBVTT

00:02.810 --> 00:09.810
It is such a blessings to have such a nice place where
we all can meet and do the work of God. Sahaja

00:25.210 --> 00:32.210
Yogis have to remember that we are here to
do God’s work and whatever blessings we

00:35.320 --> 00:42.320
get, these are just guidelines to know that
God is creative.

00:43.550 --> 00:50.550
I think the London Sahaja Yogis are real,
really blessed ones, really blessed ones.

00:50.750 --> 00:57.750
The way they get one after another beautiful
places to live in. And, we all should be very,

00:58.250 --> 01:05.250
very thankful for what God has been very kindly
suggested to us.

01:07.550 --> 01:14.550
I came here in the afternoon just to see the
place. As I looked at these trees and the

01:27.730 --> 01:34.730
garden and the flowers – all of them are
here specially, very specially to tell you

01:43.370 --> 01:50.370
that God is creative. We have to learn a lot
through them: how they grow, how they expose

01:59.890 --> 02:06.890
themselves maximum to the rays of the sun,
how they suck their nourishment – all this

02:15.340 --> 02:22.340
is a great training for all of us. They are
absolutely entirely surrendered to God and

02:28.830 --> 02:35.830
to human beings who are the epitome of this
civilization. So, it’s such a big thing

02:40.861 --> 02:47.861
that we have a place which is unbelievably
great and that we have to be very grateful.

02:53.580 --> 03:00.580
Count your blessings, count your blessings.
There are still so many lost, so many who

03:05.010 --> 03:12.010
are going to be lost, but you are in the right
path. This is sort of an advanced payment.

03:17.510 --> 03:19.981
[laughter]

03:19.981 --> 03:26.981
It’s so beautiful and so sweet but one has
to know, as I told you before, that we are

03:34.060 --> 03:39.731
not going to stay in the ashram just to make
our life convenient and leisurely. That’s

03:39.731 --> 03:46.731
not the way we should look at things. If you
have to live in the ashram, we have to discipline

03:48.921 --> 03:55.921
ourselves. You have to better yourself, everyday
you have to rise. Certain rules and regulations

03:58.310 --> 04:05.310
of the ashram must be observed. There should
be no idea of a democratic government where

04:07.020 --> 04:14.020
everybody has a right to vote and can demand
what they want. On the contrary, it is the

04:15.580 --> 04:22.580
great privilege that you are supposed to enjoy
the blessings. It’s a great advantage for

04:28.860 --> 04:35.860
you that you are so fortunate to see these
things with your eyes open, that God exists

04:38.740 --> 04:45.740
and He rewards. This understanding should
give you more and more courage and complete

04:56.911 --> 05:03.911
willingness to improve yourself. This is the
most important thing. Sahaja Yoga is of course

05:05.020 --> 05:11.890
as you know is for your transformation and
an ashram is for your improvement. So, those

05:11.890 --> 05:17.010
people who are going to stay here or those
who are going to visit here have to relatively

05:17.010 --> 05:24.010
see how they are improving and growing. There
are many things which are going to come for

05:24.010 --> 05:31.010
us. They look material but they have an atmosphere
of spirituality.

05:34.600 --> 05:38.640
Try to settle down with yourself. Don’t
quarrel [It seems that Shri Mataji says someone’s

05:38.640 --> 05:45.600
name but can’t make it out] He wants you
to be comfortable. After a month you’ll

05:45.600 --> 05:50.131
get all the Sahaja Yogis who have to stay
here. We’ll sort it out and then they will

05:50.131 --> 05:54.820
be allowed to stay here. Till then we have
to see what people are coming from abroad,

05:54.820 --> 06:01.750
they must also have proper places to live
in. At the most a month, some people would

06:01.750 --> 06:08.750
like to stay here, but some of you will have
to be here to look after them, to give them

06:11.480 --> 06:18.480
all your help. Those who have car, who have
time, should come down here and start it out.

06:20.721 --> 06:27.721
We have to organize it on proper lines. There
are three Sahaja Yogis are coming across the

06:31.151 --> 06:38.151
oceans, and one of them also to stay here.
Try to make their stay comfortable. They are

06:42.831 --> 06:49.831
your brothers of great achievements, and we
have to respect them and look after them.

06:50.771 --> 06:57.771
I’m happy we have here from America another
great Sahaja Yogi. Try to help them. Whatever

07:03.971 --> 07:10.041
they need, whatever they want to do, they
want to go out – make arrangements, make

07:10.041 --> 07:17.041
it easy. If they want a car or anything, try
to help them.

07:20.341 --> 07:27.341
Secondly, you must keep it clean, look after
it. You have entered into another arena now,

07:30.641 --> 07:37.641
on another level where your own comforts should
not be considered, it’s the comfort of others.

07:38.000 --> 07:43.691
Now, you are at a giving stage. So, what are
we going to give others, you have to see.

07:43.691 --> 07:47.091
Not what we are going to have “Oh this is
not good, there’s no hot water, there’s

07:47.091 --> 07:54.091
this thing.” – all you forget, you will
not need anything.

07:57.950 --> 08:04.950
So many will be pouring down. Who else has
come for Guru Puja now? Apart from Herman.

08:06.031 --> 08:08.841
You have come from where?

08:08.841 --> 08:11.130
[A yogi speaks – inaudible]

08:11.130 --> 08:13.431
Oh I see, good.

08:13.431 --> 08:20.431
So, all those who are coming from anywhere
else, you see, have to stay. And those people

08:24.980 --> 08:30.061
who want to look after them, you can have
turns.

08:30.061 --> 08:34.901
Now today is the … what is the date today?

08:34.901 --> 08:35.980
Yogi: Seventeenth.

08:35.980 --> 08:42.980
Shri Mataji: All right! Modi is coming on
the nineteenth, I believe. He’s coming on

08:45.580 --> 08:51.580
nineteenth. Anybody who is going to organize
here, food and all that … Michael? Who else

08:51.580 --> 08:52.421
with you?

08:52.421 --> 08:53.941
Is David? Where is David?

08:53.941 --> 09:00.941
There he is. All right! So, I’ll give you
a check of thousand pounds which you can cash.

09:06.921 --> 09:13.760
Get all the ration and everything with some
girls here.

09:13.760 --> 09:19.260
I’m not going to pay. You have money in
the bank. Now, don’t get upset. I see some

09:19.260 --> 09:21.840
people frowning [laughter]

09:21.840 --> 09:28.840
I’m not going to pay anymore now. Finished!
All right. So, we have money in the bank and

09:33.531 --> 09:39.380
that money has to come handy now. So, about
thousand pounds I would like to sanction.

09:39.380 --> 09:43.821
And, David you. Michael. Who else is here?

09:43.821 --> 09:50.370
All right. That’s good. So four of you put
together, you decide what you want to buy.

09:50.370 --> 09:55.840
And, some ladies you need here to help. Who
will be here?

09:55.840 --> 09:56.740
Kay?

09:56.740 --> 10:03.740
Who else? Those who are free. You – two.
Who else?

10:06.000 --> 10:13.000
All right for the time being. Two of you and
four of these boys. The rest of you should

10:22.260 --> 10:28.830
not shift here, should not stay here. But
once, you see, these people are over, finished

10:28.830 --> 10:34.051
with it, then you can shift here. We’ll
see that. For now, we have two ladies who

10:34.051 --> 10:41.021
are willing to stay here and four gentlemen.
All right? At least till the Guru Puja it’ll

10:41.021 --> 10:46.880
be quite busy, I think, lots of people will
be coming. So, some more ladies who can spare

10:46.880 --> 10:53.811
their time for these three-four days should
also raise their hands, I think, these three-four

10:53.811 --> 11:00.811
days. All right? Who else?

11:05.031 --> 11:05.281
What are you doing, Tanya?

11:05.281 --> 11:05.531
Tanya: I’m working.

11:05.441 --> 11:12.441
Shri Mataji: You are working, won’t be free.
All right. So about, say, three ladies are

11:17.590 --> 11:19.771
there.

11:19.771 --> 11:26.771
So, three and four – seven people. Till
the Guru Puja, we can manage somehow and then

11:45.281 --> 11:52.281
we’ll see what happens.

11:54.021 --> 11:56.200
Hello?

11:56.200 --> 12:03.200
It’s all right. It’s all right. [inaudible]
The children are [inaudible]

12:16.791 --> 12:23.791
So, those who are already here … who are
those who are staying here?

12:25.130 --> 12:32.130
You are staying here and who? John, you are
there – four of you. Four. Five. Five of

12:34.830 --> 12:41.830
you are here. Six? Six of you. Who is in Chelsham
Road now? What the girls are there? Michael

12:49.090 --> 12:51.760
you are not here?

12:51.760 --> 12:58.760
[A yogi speaks – inaudible]

12:58.950 --> 13:05.950
No, I think you come along. Till the Guru
Puja, you see, you need here some people to

13:09.960 --> 13:16.250
really do the job. You may go to sleep there
if there’s no room, if there are too many

13:16.250 --> 13:19.521
people. I think we can manage.

13:19.521 --> 13:26.521
Guru Puja is on the twenty-fourth only. So,
hardly there are three-four days. I mean,

13:28.021 --> 13:35.021
when will you go to Guru Puja? Evening? Friday
evening or Friday morning?

13:37.980 --> 13:40.090
[Yogi responds - inaudible]

13:40.090 --> 13:47.090
Friday? Friday. So, you see, hardly anytime.
Today is what… let Me see… Monday, Tuesday…

13:50.600 --> 13:57.600
four-five days. All right. I may also shift
Myself. If the servants are here – no problem.

14:01.801 --> 14:04.130
They will cook for Me.

14:04.130 --> 14:06.630
But what the gas is working here?

14:06.630 --> 14:09.620
[Yogi responds - inaudible]

14:09.620 --> 14:16.620
Gas is not here. So, how do we cook?

14:17.090 --> 14:24.090
[Yogi responds – gas has been disconnected
downstairs… - inaudible]

14:26.210 --> 14:26.830
Is it?

14:26.830 --> 14:30.321
[Yogi responds – yes, I’ve had a look
downstairs]

14:30.321 --> 14:37.321
So, if you get the gas, then it’s very easy.
I can get the servants here. Then, I can shift

14:38.531 --> 14:45.531
Myself in a way. All right?

15:00.011 --> 15:04.881
If there are say, five people – you five
people and three ladies – they can cook

15:04.881 --> 15:09.861
for you, no problem, all of you. But gas you
must have. Without gas they cannot manage.

15:09.861 --> 15:13.330
The water is running there? Hot and cold,
both?

15:13.330 --> 15:15.051
[Yogi responds - inaudible]

15:15.051 --> 15:22.051
Just cold. So, how will you have hot water?
Is there an arrangement?

15:25.771 --> 15:29.651
[Yogi responds - inaudible]

15:29.651 --> 15:36.651
All right. So, gas connection if you can get
it tomorrow … is it possible?

15:37.621 --> 15:44.621
Yogi: Yes, I can get the gas connected as
well as I can get the hot water running.

15:49.141 --> 15:51.941
Shri Mataji: Without that how will you manage,
I just can’t understand.

15:51.941 --> 15:55.340
Yogi: They’ll have to do it tomorrow night.

15:55.340 --> 16:00.131
Shri Mataji: Yes, of course! Is there an electric
cooker here?

16:00.131 --> 16:02.301
Yogi: No. We only got one electric kettle
at the moment.

16:02.301 --> 16:09.301
Shri Mataji: No, you have to have the gas.
Otherwise it won’t work out. If they connect

16:12.021 --> 16:17.381
it tomorrow, the servants can come and start
cooking. In any case, I’ll ask them to shift

16:17.381 --> 16:23.911
everything here, whatever is possible - vegetables
and ghee and all that. Plus, I’ll give you

16:23.911 --> 16:28.421
money to buy rice perhaps we may need.

16:28.421 --> 16:35.421
So, about four people: gentlemen would be
five and ladies would be three. Five and three

16:38.671 --> 16:43.161
– eight persons. All right.

16:43.161 --> 16:48.121
As soon as the gas is connected, they can
shift here. That’s the point is. Gas must

16:48.121 --> 16:55.121
be connected. Otherwise, where will they cook?
You see, there’s no electrical cooker.

16:55.501 --> 17:02.501
Yogini: Mother, I’ve got a smaller electric
cooker – just two rings and smaller than

17:06.161 --> 17:10.301
oven. Perhaps it would be a start.

17:10.301 --> 17:12.391
Shri Mataji: Start, we can!

17:12.391 --> 17:19.391
Yogini: I’ve got it in the car actually.

17:21.350 --> 17:26.951
Shri Mataji: Is it? [laughter]

17:26.951 --> 17:33.951
Yogini: Because, we drove it from London to
Brighton but we didn’t unload it and so,

17:35.331 --> 17:38.980
we brought it all the way back but I couldn’t
understand why. [laughter]

17:38.980 --> 17:45.051
Shri Mataji: Now, what do you say to that,
[It seems that Shri Mataji says someone’s

17:45.051 --> 17:50.511
name but can’t make it out]. I was wondering
how is she got the thing… [laughter]. So,

17:50.511 --> 17:57.511
we don’t have to worry about anything whatsoever.
But still we’ll need gas thing, but for

17:57.951 --> 18:03.951
the time being it’s good. All right, you
shift it here.

18:03.951 --> 18:06.361
[Yogi says something – inaudible.]

18:06.361 --> 18:11.011
So, better do something with the gas also.
All right? Because without the gas, so much

18:11.011 --> 18:16.711
cooking cannot be done. Partly, as she said.
So, better unload the thing and put it down

18:16.711 --> 18:17.391
there.

18:17.391 --> 18:20.141
[Yogi says something – inaudible.]

18:20.141 --> 18:22.881
Gas, on your own?

18:22.881 --> 18:29.881
Yogi: It will be better if we had a gas man
there. [laughter]

18:32.381 --> 18:38.421
Shri Mataji: You better go and tell them,
“if you don’t connect, we’ll connect

18:38.421 --> 18:45.421
ourselves [laughter].” I tell you, so many
beautiful things happening. So, we have to

18:49.831 --> 18:56.131
have that hot water started immediately as
soon as the gas. So, tomorrow morning what

18:56.131 --> 18:58.151
time, John, you think you can do for the gas?

18:58.151 --> 18:59.591
Yogi: nine o’clock

18:59.591 --> 19:06.411
Shri Mataji: So, let him come here by nine
o’clock? Then, you go ahead with him, and

19:06.411 --> 19:13.411
get the man and get it done. All right. Douglas,
I know you can manage. Douglas is really a

19:17.261 --> 19:23.131
daring person. The way he has fought all the
TM bhoots, you see, they’re all literally

19:23.131 --> 19:26.881
frightened of him. [laughter]

19:26.881 --> 19:33.051
You must see today’s article in The Times.
Did you read? Horrible article. Did you see

19:33.051 --> 19:39.251
the… My God! You must see that. He was very
upset - David Krall. He came down and showed

19:39.251 --> 19:44.751
Me the article. It was horrible. They are
already trying to advertise it and do all

19:44.751 --> 19:48.651
kinds of things and, there’s somebody whom
they have paid perhaps for writing. David

19:48.651 --> 19:51.861
can tell you. David, have you got the article?

19:51.861 --> 19:53.141
[Yogi responds.]

19:53.141 --> 20:00.141
So, we are going to work on that. Horrible
article! He was very upset – David. [laughter]

20:03.041 --> 20:10.041
All right, he is going to get the photocopy.
Give it to Gavin. Give it to Gavin. Hold it

20:15.871 --> 20:22.871
with the prong. [laughter]

20:30.061 --> 20:36.661
So shameless and so fraudulent! It’s all
falsehood they are talking; absolute falsehood.

20:36.661 --> 20:43.011
So many people are levitating. Their guru
is levitating in the room. Everybody is levitating

20:43.011 --> 20:47.771
there, you see. All falsehood, they can disappear
in thin air.

20:47.771 --> 20:54.771
Yogi: It’s all Your work, mother. [Everyone
bursts into laughter]

20:56.401 --> 21:02.311
And, seventeen thousand people are following…
seventeen million or something.

21:02.311 --> 21:04.301
Yogis: Three hundred million.

21:04.301 --> 21:11.301
Shri Mataji: Three hundred million. All false.
All, I tell you, all falsehood. But, I tell

21:11.791 --> 21:18.791
you, these media people don’t understand
what they are up to. One has to write something

21:20.201 --> 21:27.201
to them that this all is false. Very disastrous!
Horrible!

21:30.011 --> 21:37.011
Yogi: Media is skeptical of it … enlightenment,
world peace. They had to have metal detector

21:40.111 --> 21:44.031
when they went to their head quarter. [inaudible]

21:44.031 --> 21:46.951
Shri Mataji: We have our own detector.

21:46.951 --> 21:48.011
Yogi: Yes.

21:48.011 --> 21:55.011
Shri Mataji: Isn’t it? With our detector
we found that you are devils.

21:55.131 --> 22:02.131
So, once we have this then it all came so
fast. Isn’t it? Doesn’t matter. So, you

22:09.331 --> 22:14.470
arrange the first floor and the second floor
for all the people who want to come. You keep

22:14.470 --> 22:21.470
the first floor for the ladies and the second
for the men. All right? Not the other way

22:22.730 --> 22:28.771
round. Because there would be many who would
be married with children. But most of them

22:28.771 --> 22:34.551
will be in Brighton – directly going to
that. But Jason, have you been able to receive

22:34.551 --> 22:40.111
their information about when they are coming,
how they are going, what place they want,

22:40.111 --> 22:41.181
how they want to be allotted?

22:41.181 --> 22:47.871
Jason: Some of them, Mother, yes. We have
the French people, most of them arriving on

22:47.871 --> 22:54.871
Saturday while some going directly to the
place on Friday. The Swiss people are arriving

22:55.730 --> 23:02.730
about 3 o’clock Friday afternoon. I think
also, the Italians are coming about that time.

23:07.161 --> 23:09.651
Phil Ward is in charge of organizing shuttle
and cars to bring them from the station to

23:09.651 --> 23:16.651
the seminar. The Swiss people and probably
the Italians also would like to stay here

23:17.541 --> 23:24.541
Sunday night because their flight goes on
Monday.

23:24.911 --> 23:28.921
Shri Mataji: Oh, that’s [inaudible]. Also,
you will be surprised that this is on your

23:28.921 --> 23:34.551
way to Brighton. So, even if they are coming
earlier you can give this address to them

23:34.551 --> 23:40.161
so that they can come here first. And, from
here you can take some sort of a bus or something

23:40.161 --> 23:41.411
to take all of them together.

23:41.411 --> 23:46.931
Jason: Yes, Mother. There’s a green bus
that goes from Heathrow Airport to Gatwick

23:46.931 --> 23:53.931
Airport that goes almost right pass the door…
[inaudible]

23:59.090 --> 24:06.090
Shri Mataji: But why not make one place for
them to meet first of all? Some of them are

24:12.291 --> 24:18.891
coming from the back doors also or what? Are
they coming from the Brighton side?

24:18.891 --> 24:25.891
Jason: Yes, Mother. Some of them. [Inaudible]

24:26.131 --> 24:33.131
Shri Mataji: But if they are
coming on a Sunday here or something, why
not they come here?

24:48.411 --> 24:52.251
Jason: That will be after the Puja. [Inaudible]

24:52.251 --> 24:55.980
Shri Mataji: So how many will be here actually?

24:55.980 --> 25:01.321
Jason: On Sunday night, probably about fifty
or so.

25:01.321 --> 25:02.251
Shri Mataji: Fifty here?

25:02.251 --> 25:06.090
Jason: Just for the Sunday night but maybe
there will be others ….[Inaudible]

25:06.090 --> 25:12.081
Shri Mataji: All right. So, for Friday how
many will be here?

25:12.081 --> 25:16.961
Jason: Not sure… [Inaudible]

25:16.961 --> 25:23.961
[Shri Mataji greets someone on the side]

25:24.441 --> 25:31.441
Yogi: Three Italians are coming on Thursday
night.

25:33.011 --> 25:36.011
Shri Mataji: Thursday night?

25:36.011 --> 25:40.401
Yogi: And Friday morning seven o’clock is
arriving a group with …

25:40.401 --> 25:41.701
Shri Mataji: Friday morning?

25:41.701 --> 25:45.891
Yogi: Friday morning. And they want to stay
in the Ashram. I’ll bring them here.

25:45.891 --> 25:51.211
Shri Mataji: All right. So, keep it Thursday.
Say so from … it’s going to be on. But

25:51.211 --> 25:55.581
I mean gas has to be there. As soon as gas
is there I can shift here. No problem. But

25:55.581 --> 26:02.581
gas has to be here. I’ll bring the servants
also with Me.

26:03.600 --> 26:08.931
But after the Puja, after the thing Sunday
we should find out exactly how many people

26:08.931 --> 26:12.671
are coming here, because Sunday night food
can be cooked here for them. Isn’t it? And,

26:12.671 --> 26:15.331
they go on Monday morning?

26:15.331 --> 26:16.331
Yogi: Yes, Mother.

26:16.331 --> 26:23.331
Shri Mataji: That’s it. So, we can arrange
that also. It could be arranged very clearly.

26:25.641 --> 26:32.641
Nick, you have got this van till tomorrow?

26:37.701 --> 26:44.701
Nick: Yes, Mother. I should be able to extend
it. [Inaudible]

26:48.641 --> 26:50.141
Shri Mataji: All right. So tomorrow, why don’t
you send the van to Me?

26:50.141 --> 26:50.611
Nick: Yes, Mother.

26:50.611 --> 26:53.151
Shri Mataji: All right. Then, we’ll extend
it. I’ll pay for the extension.

26:53.151 --> 26:55.171
Nick : There’s no need for that, Mother.

26:55.171 --> 27:01.011
Shri Mataji: No, no, no. One day, I’ll pay
for it. All right? So, you send the van tomorrow

27:01.011 --> 27:08.011
to Me and then extend it. Hmm? Yes, tomorrow
if you send Me the van, I can send Debbie,

27:08.111 --> 27:14.041
and if the gas is fixed, they can start cooking
here. Even for… I mean you can cook for

27:14.041 --> 27:18.720
few people on that but ten people I don’t
know.

27:18.720 --> 27:20.970
Yogini responds [Inaudble]

27:20.970 --> 27:27.970
Shri Mataji: Best is to have

28:00.871 --> 28:07.871
the gas, you see.

28:22.590 --> 28:29.590
He has given birth. Hello! He has given birth.
I mean not he. [laughter] His wife has given

29:14.611 --> 29:21.611
birth to a baby boy and you know they had
very bad time with the twins that they had.

29:21.730 --> 29:27.761
It’s horrible. Tenants had an effect on
the baby and the thing was delayed by about

29:27.761 --> 29:34.761
one week but the baby is very healthy – nine
pound something and I have given him the name

29:35.141 --> 29:42.141
Janak - Janaka. I hope you are happy with
the name. He’s a very sweet baby. All right.

29:44.921 --> 29:51.921
Now, those who are coming from outside like
... are you come from Northampton, Southampton?

29:53.691 --> 30:00.691
Who else? All of you. Where are you staying
now? Where are you staying tonight? You’ll

30:05.861 --> 30:12.861
go back? You won’t come here? I mean, you
are not going to stay till Guru Puja? You

30:16.850 --> 30:18.720
want to stay here?

30:18.720 --> 30:23.281
[Yogi response inaudible]

30:23.281 --> 30:30.281
All right. All right, you’ll go back to
Southampton and then you will come. So, how

30:35.391 --> 30:42.391
are you? How is your wife? Same? So, she is
here or in Spain?

30:46.671 --> 30:51.600
[Yogi response inaudible]

30:51.600 --> 30:58.581
She is in Cambridge. How is the baby? He’ll
come round.

30:58.581 --> 31:05.581
Boghdan, how are you? How is your wife?

31:16.991 --> 31:23.991
So, for you four-five people who are staying
here after getting the gas, you see – after

31:27.080 --> 31:32.071
getting the gas, again I say, you come and
see Me tomorrow. Someone having any problem

31:32.071 --> 31:39.071
over here you better stay with Me for the
time being till we get gas. What about his

31:41.760 --> 31:48.760
food? Let him in Chelsham Road, I think till
then. If we get the gas tomorrow then there’s

31:50.600 --> 31:54.691
no problem, you see. Then we will call you
from Chelsham Road. All right? Let him be

31:54.691 --> 31:56.861
there at Chelsham Road. Who’s at Chelsham
Road now?

31:56.861 --> 32:01.530
All right, Graham [We are not sure if Shri
Mataji says Graham or not] you are organizing

32:01.530 --> 32:08.530
there. So, look after him. And, if we get
the gas tomorrow then he can shift here. All

32:13.661 --> 32:15.220
right?

32:15.220 --> 32:22.220
How are you? All right? You wrote a very nice
letter to that man, that newspaper fellow.

32:31.480 --> 32:38.480
Horrible. Just imagine I never even asked
anybody to take out the coat or anything.

32:38.621 --> 32:45.621
In general way I said you take out your coats.
They have objection even for that. Can you

32:46.740 --> 32:53.740
meditate with your raincoat on you? Absurd,
I tell you! How can these newspaper people

32:54.240 --> 33:01.240
be so stupid to write all that? I can’t
understand.

33:02.111 --> 33:09.111
Yogini; Mother, sorry to interrupt You. There’s
been a very funny new development, because

33:14.861 --> 33:21.861
this horrible man’s name has appeared in
the newspaper again. In Brighton, this horrible

33:23.591 --> 33:30.591
nudist beach which makes us so sick, we heard
some very good news. By Your Grace, they want

33:35.181 --> 33:38.371
to take away the nudist beach.

33:38.371 --> 33:40.460
Shri Mataji: Nudist?

33:40.460 --> 33:47.460
Yogini: The horrible naked beach they want
to take away. But, the man who would not take

33:57.141 --> 34:04.141
off his shoes before You, has written to the
newspaper saying “Nudist beach is very good,

34:12.111 --> 34:16.601
everyone should take out all their clothes.”

34:16.601 --> 34:23.601
Shri Mataji: Except for the raincoat! Look
at this stupidity! [laughter] Now, what do

34:27.101 --> 34:29.490
you say to these real stupid people, you know.

34:29.490 --> 34:33.720
Why not write a strong letter to editor of
this?

34:33.720 --> 34:35.430
[Yogi response inaudible]

34:35.430 --> 34:42.430
Why do they give him so much importance? Who
is he? He is the Managing Director of what

34:45.730 --> 34:46.871
company? Better…

34:46.871 --> 34:48.591
[Yogi response inaudible]

34:48.591 --> 34:55.591
Better write to them. All of you should do
it. Stupid fellow! Stupid people live here,

35:05.561 --> 35:12.561
I tell you. What were you saying? John was
telling Me something about you.

35:15.190 --> 35:22.190
Yes, you communicated something to John? John,
didn’t you say?

35:25.121 --> 35:29.540
[Yogi response inaudible]

35:29.540 --> 35:31.010
Paste?

35:31.010 --> 35:35.440
[Yogi response inaudible]

35:35.440 --> 35:41.601
That is sandalwood paste to be made with a
stone, that one. John, you know what he told

35:41.601 --> 35:48.601
Me he wants to know the name of the stone
that is to sit on his head. [laughter]

35:49.381 --> 35:53.220
I said, “Stone!” I mean I’m quite strange
but not to that extent. [laughter]

35:53.220 --> 36:00.220
I couldn’t understand. I’m sorry for that.
All right, this is the stone I was saying

36:00.801 --> 36:07.160
or any stone like this, anyone which you can
rub. This is the thing – chandan, you can

36:07.160 --> 36:09.601
put it. [Shri Mataji talks in the side]

36:09.601 --> 36:16.601
All right. So, with just this thing I said,that
on the stone is I’m rubbing it. Show him

36:28.631 --> 36:31.601
that, Gavin.

36:31.601 --> 36:38.601
Because of the heat, you see. Chandan is the
best for heat. If you get blisters due to

36:49.210 --> 36:56.210
heat or anything – just rub this and put
it on the thing – very good. Have you heard

37:04.410 --> 37:08.150
of any famous astrologer called M. K. Gandhi,
anyone of you?

37:08.150 --> 37:10.851
Yogi: Yes.

37:10.851 --> 37:17.851
Shri Mataji: Have you? I’ve never heard.

37:20.290 --> 37:27.290
Yogi: I’m sure I’ve seen his advertisements.

37:29.730 --> 37:36.730
Shri Mataji: He’s telling others good things
about Me.

37:39.561 --> 37:46.561
That’s Athena. Athena, now, what’s happening?
Now, slowly. What happened? One chana. I only

37:55.780 --> 38:02.780
had three of them just now. All right, how
many do you want? As soon as I eat the chana,

38:05.520 --> 38:12.440
the Ganas are standing there. [laughter]

38:12.440 --> 38:19.440
The Ganas are waiting to have some. That’s
their share. All right.

38:30.091 --> 38:37.091
Now, we will have the puja and then we will
have more chana. All right, sit down. It’s

39:10.940 --> 39:17.940
all right.

39:22.030 --> 39:29.030
[Yogi says something – inaudible]

39:44.200 --> 39:46.690
Have you read the letter of Patrick?

39:46.690 --> 39:53.690
What can I say? Very uncertain. Only good
news is that one Mr. Marwah who was going

40:06.690 --> 40:13.690
to do all our publicity work has been elected
as the Mayor, Mayor of Los Angeles. That’s

40:16.101 --> 40:23.101
a very big news and this may do something
good, I think. So, first I’m going to do

40:24.061 --> 40:28.500
all this in Los Angeles. Actually, I’ll
go to New York only to meet the Sahaja Yogis

40:28.500 --> 40:35.270
there. And, then I will… as the program
is… you know the program, everything…

40:35.270 --> 40:41.990
I’m happy you could come because they are
really worried about American tour. How they

40:41.990 --> 40:48.990
will take it, whether it will be successful
or not? It will be!

40:50.390 --> 40:57.390
Lets look at these nice Yogis people… just
look at them. Not worse person has seen them

41:01.341 --> 41:08.341
levited. But they are telling all lies, you
see. “There is very much better coordination

41:11.130 --> 41:18.061
of the body and the mind.” Can you believe
such a false story?

41:18.061 --> 41:25.061
So, I told him that you should meet this Dr.
Fredick or what was his name? Fredick? Ah,

41:25.321 --> 41:30.530
Frenny. You go and see him. Show him this
article. You should say that we all want to

41:30.530 --> 41:36.390
protest. He himself will be very happy. That
this is how he is going to cheat us, he is

41:36.390 --> 41:42.290
fraudulent. And, why not we all put together?
Write a letter to the editor that, “You

41:42.290 --> 41:49.290
have no business to publicize such a person
who has ruined the lives of so many.”

41:50.140 --> 41:57.140
Have you got that article of Madhu Dave…
Madhu Jain?

42:01.611 --> 42:04.321
[Yogi response inaudible.]

42:04.321 --> 42:11.321
Activities in India… six thousand crores,
ah? And, what David Praul told Me is this

42:16.260 --> 42:22.081
that so much has been written against him
but there is no mention of it. So, you take

42:22.081 --> 42:28.930
David Praul, you and Frenny and all these
people put together. Make a very strong letter

42:28.930 --> 42:35.311
about it and let Dr. Frenny put it in. And
say, there are people here who can really…

42:35.311 --> 42:42.311
thousands of people who can say what I’m
saying. Get hold of him.

42:48.371 --> 42:55.371
The doctor friend of Rustom, did you contact
him? John, did you give him the address of

42:55.690 --> 43:02.690
the doctor? Did you tell them about it? I
think Pamela was there. Pamela?

43:05.341 --> 43:06.480
[Pamela response inaudible]

43:06.480 --> 43:13.480
What about that doctor? Did you tell him that
he should come for the Puja? Then what did

43:14.801 --> 43:16.210
he say?

43:16.210 --> 43:18.331
[Pamela response inaudible]

43:18.331 --> 43:21.150
What did he say?

43:21.150 --> 43:23.260
[Pamela response inaudible]

43:23.260 --> 43:30.260
Hmm… See, all such like that Di, Lady Di
or whoever she is… how is she now?

43:35.130 --> 43:40.831
[Yogi response inaudible]

43:40.831 --> 43:47.230
So, why not take her help also in writing.
Now, you see, Warren is coming, all these

43:47.230 --> 43:52.720
people are coming – you can all put facts
together. See this Dr. Frenny – all of you.

43:52.720 --> 43:57.480
And, tell him what he’s doing and what sort
of trouble he has given to others and how

43:57.480 --> 44:03.311
he has taken the money. You go and tell him
very strongly. You, especially, we have to

44:03.311 --> 44:09.101
save others now. It’s very important. Another
thing he says that Atlanta someplace somewhere

44:09.101 --> 44:13.650
has all people have become very peaceful.
Naturally, if you make somebody into a cabbage

44:13.650 --> 44:20.650
they will be. But the majority of the people,
I mean the greater percentage of the people

44:22.640 --> 44:29.640
who are in Ireland and who are in Israel have
become much more violent. One percent in Ireland

44:37.200 --> 44:44.200
and three percent in Israel. And, you see,
how they are behaving. So, this Atlanta we

44:47.351 --> 44:52.101
cannot find out but what about these two places?

44:52.101 --> 44:56.720
This Madhu… if you get his thing you can
write down. He says that wherever his ashrams

44:56.720 --> 45:03.720
are nothing grows. Even the cows become barren.
Or you can ask Murray how it was published.

45:16.500 --> 45:20.390
It was sent to us, I think.

45:20.390 --> 45:24.500
Yogi: Murray has that?

45:24.500 --> 45:31.500
Shri Mataji: Murray has that so ask Murray
to help you there. All right? Now, one thing

45:33.430 --> 45:40.430
you can catch on him which you can play about
to say that he is anti-Christ. Whatever he

45:42.480 --> 45:48.851
preaches is anti-Christ. Because he leads
a life of licentiousness? himself and you

45:48.851 --> 45:53.140
can give the example of Linda’s things that
was written. She has written it down. Then

45:53.140 --> 45:58.321
he himself is making money out of us and has
got all the material things of the world at

45:58.321 --> 46:05.321
the cost of his disciples. He is an anti-Christ
and there is no relationship of his work with

46:11.220 --> 46:18.061
Christ, first of all. And, secondly you can
also put Karpur Gaurav and all that are actually

46:18.061 --> 46:21.190
the worship of I think Shiva or something.

46:21.190 --> 46:28.190
[Shri Mataji asks someone in Hindi is the
Karpur Gaurav mantra is for Shivji or not.]

46:46.450 --> 46:53.450
It is the Shiva’s worship. So, what they
tell them is the idol worship of Shiva – put

46:55.290 --> 47:02.290
it down. But because they don’t know any
Sanskrit they go on saying. All right? Modi

47:03.111 --> 47:09.581
will be coming, he will give you the complete
shloka. It’s Shiva’s worship. So, that

47:09.581 --> 47:12.601
will go in the Christian mind here.

47:12.601 --> 47:19.601
Then, another good news is: Rustom has said
that in the Koran there is a description of

47:23.990 --> 47:30.460
Kundalini. They call it Assas and that at
the resurrection time, the Kundalini will

47:30.460 --> 47:36.510
be awakened by Mahdi. It’s all there. So
many things in the Koran, he was saying that

47:36.510 --> 47:43.510
there are seven heavens, firmaments, through
which human beings has to pass, one has to

47:44.740 --> 47:46.500
ascend through this.

47:46.500 --> 47:51.851
But I was reading a book given to Me by one
of the Sahaja Yogis in Brighton. It’s very

47:51.851 --> 47:58.851
clearly said in that there are angels of the
Mother and angels of the heavens and then

48:03.990 --> 48:10.990
seven of them and seven of these and everything.
And, according to My calculation it is describing

48:12.581 --> 48:19.581
Monday as the sabbath - Monday. Because as
you go you see, the Creator is on the third

48:20.740 --> 48:27.170
day or second day. It should be on the third
day. It’s the second day. First is the angel

48:27.170 --> 48:34.170
of the joy. And, that is Shiva. So, it is
Monday. Like that. Very clearly. And it is

48:34.390 --> 48:38.410
all written down, it’s preserved, and they
have just taken it out and translated. Can

48:38.410 --> 48:43.260
you imagine? We have got now the scriptures
to go with. Those books are with Me – two

48:43.260 --> 48:48.780
of them. Can you get those books for Me, from
some shop?

48:48.780 --> 48:55.780
Who game Me that book? You gave Me, yes!

48:56.410 --> 48:58.960
[Yogi response inaudible]

48:58.960 --> 49:02.351
Only through your University?

49:02.351 --> 49:04.900
[Yogi response inaudible]

49:04.900 --> 49:11.900
You can? So, can you, two-three people buy
that and go through it. And, you’ll be amazed.

49:13.341 --> 49:20.341
I mean, that’s the real Bible, you can say,
about Christ. Even the Bible, which is written

49:26.361 --> 49:30.571
now about the ten commandments, everything
this is related. Because that’s the original

49:30.571 --> 49:37.571
one they found Out. Can you imagine? And,
these laws that were written in Bible at the

49:40.960 --> 49:47.960
time of Moses, which are called Shariat in
the Islamic religion, are because the people

49:47.980 --> 49:54.890
had become so bad, so bad that they had to
put such terrible, strict laws that anybody

49:54.890 --> 50:01.071
does that must be cut – his throat must
be cut, his hands must be cut, legs must be

50:01.071 --> 50:07.140
cut. All this is only because of these things
happening in those days. The people were so

50:07.140 --> 50:11.361
bad, so much on the decline that they had
to change all that and they started this.

50:11.361 --> 50:18.361
This is very clearly written there. Better
get those two books and prepare it in that

50:19.630 --> 50:24.390
line. It will be good idea.

50:24.390 --> 50:31.390
All right. You want to wash My feet? This
water – you can wash My feet. You go around
