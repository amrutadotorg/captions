00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:11.040
So in conclusion, Sahaja Yoga meditation has
a significant beneficial effect on your mental

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.950
and your physical health.

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:20.950
So, to conclude, I've shown you that Sahaja
Yoga meditation has a significant effect on

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:27.740
the body, because it activates the parasympathetic
nervous system and restores your bodily functions.

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:32.410
It has an effect on the brain - it's a different
state of consciousness, you activate areas

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:38.390
of attention, you activate the limbic areas
which give you happiness, and you release,

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:45.079
good, happy, mood stabilising neurochemicals
in your brain.

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:51.280
It prevents disease because it gives you better
mental and physical health, it's a disease

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.430
therapy, so if you have any illnesses you
can use it to treat your illnesses through

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:01.420
regular meditation, and as I showed you, it
has an effect on a range of mental illnesses

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:02.710
and physical illnesses.

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:09.440
And there has never been any negative effects,
all the effects have always been positive.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.080
What is important as I said before, is the
benefits associated with the state of mental

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.590
silence, so it's the mental silence which
works.

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:17.590
And nothing else.

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:24.220
So if you meditate, you have to try to achieve
this state of mental silence as often as possible,

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:30.090
and that will be associated with better health
at a mental and physical level.

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:37.090
So, I think I've talked enough, and what we
will do now is we'll have a meditation guided

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.100
by the founder of Sahaja Yoga.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.900
And if you follow my last slide we will go
exactly there into the limbic system which

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:45.420
is here.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.980
Which is also where the last slide is, and
that's where we're going now.

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:53.750
So you have heard about all the fantastic
things which can happen to you, and hopefully,

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.240
you feel today this mental silence.

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.110
Where we're going to go now which is the Kingdom
of God within.

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:00.270
The Paradise within.

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.540
Which you can have.

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.260
Here we go.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:10.379
And if you want to know more, there are a
few web pages where you can read a bit more

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:10.390
about this Yoga.

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:10.640
Good.
