00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.999
Today we have gathered here

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.625
to worship Shri Ganesha.

00:00:38.625 --> 00:00:43.542
Shri Ganesha is the Deity of innocence.

00:00:49.417 --> 00:00:51.834
When we are born as children,

00:00:54.041 --> 00:00:57.750
it is Shri Ganesha who is acting

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.333
and we are very innocent,

00:01:03.875 --> 00:01:06.667
and it is such a powerful thing

00:01:07.542 --> 00:01:09.667
that, with this innocence,

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.750
children survive under many circumstances.

00:01:23.542 --> 00:01:28.542
And we love them, because they are innocent.

00:01:29.875 --> 00:01:34.250
We enjoy them, because they are innocent.

00:01:38.333 --> 00:01:40.125
Once we start growing,

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.667
our Sahastrara also gets closed

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:52.667
and we develop all kinds of funny things

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:58.250
that enters into us and doesn't go out.

00:02:00.125 --> 00:02:03.542
It's just there, it doesn't go out.

00:02:09.125 --> 00:02:14.041
Innocence has a great effect on our character

00:02:17.667 --> 00:02:21.959
and on our sense of chastity.

00:02:23.875 --> 00:02:25.333
Actually, when you are innocent,

00:02:25.542 --> 00:02:27.750
you don't know what is not chastity,

00:02:28.875 --> 00:02:34.542
what is being unchaste,

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:43.959
what is being cunning.

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.125
You are innocent and you are looked after

00:02:49.458 --> 00:02:52.333
by Shri Ganesha Himself.

00:02:53.458 --> 00:02:57.250
Anybody who tries to harm a innocent person,

00:02:58.166 --> 00:03:02.875
Shri Ganesha looks after you and manages you.

00:03:06.792 --> 00:03:09.792
Many people who are innocent in this world

00:03:10.999 --> 00:03:12.583
- of course there are very few -

00:03:14.041 --> 00:03:18.166
but they become so detached

00:03:18.458 --> 00:03:23.875
from all worldly problems,

00:03:24.875 --> 00:03:29.166
like lust and greed, and many other.

00:03:30.166 --> 00:03:32.250
Because they are so pure

00:03:33.667 --> 00:03:38.250
that nothing can spoil them and malign them.

00:03:39.999 --> 00:03:43.792
This is such a great blessings we have,

00:03:45.458 --> 00:03:51.041
that innocence is actually created in us,

00:03:52.375 --> 00:03:54.458
and it was created much before,

00:03:56.375 --> 00:03:57.999
all the innocence,

00:03:58.875 --> 00:04:01.999
everything was created much, much before

00:04:04.041 --> 00:04:05.250
we were created.

00:04:07.041 --> 00:04:13.250
It's such a great quality for us to become innocent.

00:04:16.875 --> 00:04:23.166
The greatest quality of Shri Ganesha is joy.

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.583
It gives you joy, as small children,

00:04:30.875 --> 00:04:32.375
they may not speak even,

00:04:32.667 --> 00:04:34.250
but they give us so much joy.

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.375
Joy giving quality comes from Shri Ganesha.

00:04:40.709 --> 00:04:43.291
Even after coming to Sahaja Yoga I've seen people

00:04:44.709 --> 00:04:46.291
are not full of joy.

00:04:46.917 --> 00:04:50.375
Are very serious, they don't know how to laugh,

00:04:51.166 --> 00:04:52.999
how to enjoy anything.

00:04:53.999 --> 00:04:57.583
That's the sign that they are still lacking in innocence.

00:04:59.709 --> 00:05:03.083
So it's important to understand

00:05:04.375 --> 00:05:05.917
that, if you are sahaja yogis,

00:05:07.166 --> 00:05:12.166
you should be joyous and give joy to others,

00:05:12.917 --> 00:05:16.166
just like children, how sweet they are.

00:05:16.917 --> 00:05:18.583
They may be newly born,

00:05:19.083 --> 00:05:21.291
but how much joy they give you.

00:05:21.792 --> 00:05:27.291
But supposing you do not have that capacity

00:05:28.917 --> 00:05:31.792
to enjoy the innocence of children,

00:05:32.083 --> 00:05:34.375
then nobody can help you.

00:05:34.917 --> 00:05:36.709
Ganesha cannot help you.

00:05:36.999 --> 00:05:41.999
Because that's the innate quality human beings have

00:05:42.792 --> 00:05:47.999
and if you don't have that quality,

00:05:48.709 --> 00:05:52.583
no use having any other sense.

00:05:53.291 --> 00:05:56.375
Like some people like food, they like colours,

00:05:56.583 --> 00:05:58.834
they like all other things.

00:05:59.417 --> 00:06:01.834
But if you don't have Shri Ganesh

00:06:02.083 --> 00:06:04.625
you cannot purely enjoy anything.

00:06:05.291 --> 00:06:08.083
So it is only Shri Ganesha's blessings

00:06:08.417 --> 00:06:13.208
that we really enjoy everything in its full measure.

00:06:13.999 --> 00:06:17.834
Otherwise, we start judging it,

00:06:19.625 --> 00:06:21.999
we start criticizing it,

00:06:22.999 --> 00:06:25.709
people raise so many things, questions.

00:06:26.917 --> 00:06:30.291
If you see something and it gives you joy,

00:06:30.917 --> 00:06:35.083
then you are supposed to give the explanation for that.

00:06:35.917 --> 00:06:39.208
As we have many critics in this world,

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:44.500
and they are all the time criticizing one another.

00:06:45.834 --> 00:06:48.709
Now the critics are criticizing critics,

00:06:48.917 --> 00:06:50.083
that's the biggest problem.

00:06:50.417 --> 00:06:51.709
That's their job.

00:06:52.417 --> 00:06:55.500
Because Ganesha is not there.

00:06:56.291 --> 00:06:59.208
And they go on criticizing others,

00:06:59.834 --> 00:07:01.999
never criticizing themselves,

00:07:02.291 --> 00:07:04.625
and thinking no end of themselves.

00:07:05.083 --> 00:07:10.625
And with that, they create a very bad kind of a community,

00:07:11.333 --> 00:07:15.917
which is actually very harmful, it's very dangerous.

00:07:16.208 --> 00:07:21.834
It's like having some sort of a boil,

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:28.333
or some sort of a septic thing in your body, in your being.

00:07:28.625 --> 00:07:32.208
So, if you cannot appreciate it,

00:07:32.333 --> 00:07:35.125
and if you cannot enjoy it,

00:07:35.417 --> 00:07:39.333
then Shri Ganesha is missing from you.

00:07:39.625 --> 00:07:43.542
You should be able to enjoy everything,

00:07:45.625 --> 00:07:50.417
and to enjoy your children, enjoy children of other people.

00:07:50.959 --> 00:07:58.750
That's the sign of your being completely blessed by Shri Ganesh.

00:08:00.542 --> 00:08:03.750
Now the beauty of Shri Ganesha is this,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.125
that it looks after your Kundalini.

00:08:07.417 --> 00:08:09.834
It guards your Kundalini.

00:08:10.125 --> 00:08:12.000
It guides your Kundalini.

00:08:12.333 --> 00:08:17.750
And throughout on all the chakras he had to bless you.

00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:22.542
If you don't have the blessings of Shri Ganesh,

00:08:22.834 --> 00:08:26.750
you'll be completely useless fellow as a sahaja yogi,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.417
because all the time you are seeing the bad points of others,

00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:34.333
all the time you are devoiding,

00:08:34.625 --> 00:08:39.417
I should say, you are getting into a problem,

00:08:41.208 --> 00:08:44.750
by which you cannot enjoy anything.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.667
By temperament you think you are very serious,

00:08:49.959 --> 00:08:53.750
you are very mature, you are very developed,

00:08:54.041 --> 00:08:55.750
but you are not innocent.

00:08:56.542 --> 00:09:00.250
Such a person gives such a headache to everyone.

00:09:00.542 --> 00:09:02.250
You know, if there's one like that,

00:09:02.542 --> 00:09:05.041
in the family, people want to get rid of him.

00:09:05.333 --> 00:09:10.959
So you should have the quality of Shri Ganesha

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:16.125
which is of giving joy to others.

00:09:16.458 --> 00:09:20.542
Depends on how much joy you can give it to others.

00:09:20.875 --> 00:09:23.333
It doesn't want anything.

00:09:23.667 --> 00:09:27.667
Such a person won't say that "I must get this,

00:09:27.959 --> 00:09:29.875
I must have this position,

00:09:30.125 --> 00:09:33.750
I should be leader, I should be this and that", no.

00:09:34.542 --> 00:09:39.041
He just enjoys giving joy, joy to others,

00:09:39.333 --> 00:09:42.875
and being humorous, and kind,

00:09:43.125 --> 00:09:48.125
and never, never tries to insult anyone and hurt anyone.

00:09:48.458 --> 00:09:53.125
If such a person hurts, by mistake also,

00:09:53.458 --> 00:09:55.250
he goes on repenting about it.

00:09:55.542 --> 00:10:00.333
And hundred times he'll beg your pardon if he has hurt you.

00:10:00.667 --> 00:10:03.750
Such a happy person is a real sahaja yogi.

00:10:04.041 --> 00:10:07.875
That's the one we want to have all around.

00:10:08.166 --> 00:10:10.875
Those who have no hatred for anyone,

00:10:11.166 --> 00:10:13.250
no malice for anyone,

00:10:13.583 --> 00:10:15.667
and not finding faults with another,

00:10:15.999 --> 00:10:19.375
but trying to find what is the good point of that person,

00:10:19.667 --> 00:10:22.583
what is so special about that person.

00:10:22.875 --> 00:10:25.999
He's not bothered as to what colour you are,

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:28.166
whether you are black or white,

00:10:28.458 --> 00:10:31.583
whether you are tall or short, it makes no difference.

00:10:31.875 --> 00:10:36.667
Because it is absolute. Absolute joy.

00:10:36.999 --> 00:10:40.667
And for this absolute joy, you don't criticize,

00:10:40.999 --> 00:10:47.583
and you don't try to find faults with others.

00:10:49.583 --> 00:10:51.458
Now, the problem is

00:10:51.792 --> 00:10:55.999
that people are getting very much advanced in this modern era,

00:10:56.250 --> 00:10:59.875
very advanced, and they are very much more advanced

00:11:00.166 --> 00:11:02.375
in criticizing others, I think.

00:11:02.667 --> 00:11:05.875
That's the maxim they have, is to criticize others.

00:11:06.166 --> 00:11:10.458
And, also, they have another very bad quality,

00:11:10.792 --> 00:11:14.999
to identify themselves with the country in which they live

00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:17.250
or with the family they are with.

00:11:17.583 --> 00:11:19.583
I have seen it creates such a problem.

00:11:20.166 --> 00:11:23.083
Also they identify themselves

00:11:23.291 --> 00:11:25.375
with the different religions they follow.

00:11:25.709 --> 00:11:29.291
Imagine, from this, how many problems have come out

00:11:29.583 --> 00:11:34.500
- that you start differentiating between one and another.

00:11:34.792 --> 00:11:38.291
For example, now supposing who is born say,

00:11:38.583 --> 00:11:42.917
in one place, so he says he's the best,

00:11:43.166 --> 00:11:45.500
his country is the best,

00:11:45.792 --> 00:11:47.500
his people are the best,

00:11:47.792 --> 00:11:50.083
and there's nothing wrong with them.

00:11:50.375 --> 00:11:56.583
On the contrary, if a person is a real sahaja yogi,

00:11:56.917 --> 00:12:00.291
who has Ganesha within him, enlightened,

00:12:00.583 --> 00:12:04.375
then he sees it and enjoys the humour behind it.

00:12:04.709 --> 00:12:07.709
The humour of all these people,

00:12:07.999 --> 00:12:10.999
what they are mad after, how they behave.

00:12:11.291 --> 00:12:15.583
I mean the way he understands the jokes behind it,

00:12:15.917 --> 00:12:18.709
jokes which is avoiding reality.

00:12:18.999 --> 00:12:21.709
And reality is only possible

00:12:21.999 --> 00:12:24.500
if you are in the realm of joy.

00:12:24.792 --> 00:12:29.500
Otherwise, all the time you find something

00:12:29.709 --> 00:12:32.083
wrong, something upsetting,

00:12:32.417 --> 00:12:33.999
so something disturbs you.

00:12:34.291 --> 00:12:40.917
But if you see the humour behind everything

00:12:41.208 --> 00:12:43.834
then you are perfectly alright.

00:12:45.834 --> 00:12:48.208
For example, I would say,

00:12:48.208 --> 00:12:51.625
that I have had many such experiences,

00:12:51.917 --> 00:12:54.709
that people have told me

00:12:54.999 --> 00:12:56.999
"Mother, such and such fellow is like that,

00:12:57.208 --> 00:12:58.208
such and such fellow is like that."

00:12:59.083 --> 00:13:03.417
So, I would ask that person:

00:13:03.709 --> 00:13:06.834
"Are you like that?" Direct.

00:13:07.083 --> 00:13:09.834
He said "No, I'm not like that".

00:13:10.083 --> 00:13:12.709
"But, I said, why everybody sees that in you?"

00:13:13.417 --> 00:13:15.083
"Must be wrong!"

00:13:15.417 --> 00:13:17.999
"All of them must be wrong or you are wrong?"

00:13:18.291 --> 00:13:21.208
Then he would say, "Maybe, myself."

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:22.709
And that's how you see,

00:13:22.999 --> 00:13:25.917
you can mould also such people, who think

00:13:26.208 --> 00:13:29.625
that they are correct and the rest of the world is all bad,

00:13:29.917 --> 00:13:32.208
and they have every right to hate them

00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:35.709
and to think in the wrong direction.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:42.333
What happens with that is that you lose the essence of joy.

00:13:43.542 --> 00:13:46.625
Essence of joy is in seeing in everything,

00:13:46.959 --> 00:13:50.333
seeing in everything the source of joy.

00:13:51.542 --> 00:13:54.125
Supposing you see something here,

00:13:54.417 --> 00:13:57.959
now, if it is odd, it should give you

00:13:58.125 --> 00:14:00.333
also a great sense of humour.

00:14:00.625 --> 00:14:03.834
If it is beautiful, it should give you another

00:14:04.125 --> 00:14:05.417
sense, of appreciation.

00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:09.125
But I can't understand people who go on harping

00:14:09.417 --> 00:14:12.542
on some sort of a thing,

00:14:12.834 --> 00:14:14.959
that has no meaning in their lives

00:14:15.208 --> 00:14:17.208
nor in the lives of others.

00:14:19.333 --> 00:14:23.750
I would say my father had a great capacity to do that.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.000
Once, I went home, so I said this…

00:14:29.333 --> 00:14:32.625
"My brother was praising this man for his music,

00:14:32.834 --> 00:14:34.125
What do you think? His Friend"

00:14:34.417 --> 00:14:37.542
He said, "He is a musician, no doubt,

00:14:37.834 --> 00:14:39.959
but he is very courageous".

00:14:40.208 --> 00:14:41.208
I said: "Why?"

00:14:41.542 --> 00:14:44.333
"Because he may go on singing anything,

00:14:44.667 --> 00:14:48.333
he never feels bad about it. Everybody might be nervous,

00:14:48.667 --> 00:14:51.333
or everybody might be laughing at it,

00:14:51.667 --> 00:14:54.667
but he is not at all bothered.

00:14:54.959 --> 00:14:56.875
He goes on singing is his own ways."

00:14:57.125 --> 00:15:01.250
So, that is the beauty of understanding [that]

00:15:01.542 --> 00:15:04.750
every defect in a person can be enjoyed.

00:15:05.041 --> 00:15:10.542
Is very much a sense, I should say,

00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:15.959
a very subtle sense, by which you can enjoy every person.

00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:20.333
If he has defects, then you enjoy them as [a] humorous thing,

00:15:20.667 --> 00:15:23.458
and if he has something very good,

00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:25.125
then also you can enjoy.

00:15:25.458 --> 00:15:27.542
So why do you shun people?

00:15:27.875 --> 00:15:29.959
Why should you get out of people,

00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:31.959
criticize them for nothing at all?

00:15:32.125 --> 00:15:37.542
Now, under this, people have built up big organisations, you see.

00:15:37.875 --> 00:15:42.333
For examples, the Catholics will help (hate) the Protestants,

00:15:42.667 --> 00:15:45.667
the Protestants will help (hate),

00:15:45.959 --> 00:15:50.041
I mean not "help" I'm saying, they will also, sort of,

00:15:50.041 --> 00:15:54.041
hate the people who are Catholic.

00:15:54.333 --> 00:15:56.250
What's the use of that?

00:15:56.583 --> 00:16:00.166
What's the use of hating each other,

00:16:00.375 --> 00:16:03.250
from that point, that somebody is a Protestant

00:16:03.583 --> 00:16:05.375
and somebody is a Catholic?

00:16:05.667 --> 00:16:07.792
Just see yourself.

00:16:08.041 --> 00:16:09.999
See what is wrong with you!

00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:11.999
Why do you think like that?

00:16:12.250 --> 00:16:13.999
Why do you look at those things

00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:17.250
and always think that another person,

00:16:17.458 --> 00:16:19.166
something wrong with him.

00:16:19.375 --> 00:16:22.583
And then you form groups and then you fight,

00:16:22.875 --> 00:16:26.166
you can have even wars with this kind of an idea

00:16:26.458 --> 00:16:29.041
that the another person is not all right

00:16:29.667 --> 00:16:31.792
and you are absolutely perfect.

00:16:32.041 --> 00:16:34.375
This is also with the country, I have seen.

00:16:34.667 --> 00:16:37.250
For example, even in Sahaja Yoga I have seen

00:16:37.583 --> 00:16:40.375
if somebody is coming, say, from India

00:16:40.667 --> 00:16:43.166
or from another country anywhere,

00:16:43.458 --> 00:16:48.250
the leader will be anxious that he should or she should

00:16:48.583 --> 00:16:50.792
put her  candidate before Me.

00:16:51.583 --> 00:16:54.166
It's such an identification,

00:16:54.375 --> 00:16:57.583
which they are not still conscious of it.

00:16:57.875 --> 00:17:00.250
But then I play my tricks you see.

00:17:00.583 --> 00:17:02.500
All such thing when they do,

00:17:02.792 --> 00:17:06.500
when they try to support one party,

00:17:06.792 --> 00:17:09.083
one type of people, from one reli…,

00:17:09.375 --> 00:17:12.291
we should say not 'religion' now, but the countries.

00:17:12.583 --> 00:17:17.291
So, this country identification is so much still in Sahaja Yoga,

00:17:17.583 --> 00:17:19.917
that, you come from one country,

00:17:20.166 --> 00:17:23.375
then you want to support that man from that country.

00:17:24.083 --> 00:17:29.917
You'll never appreciate that whosoever is good,

00:17:30.166 --> 00:17:33.583
coming from any country, is a Sahaja Yogi.

00:17:34.709 --> 00:17:36.583
We are a global community,

00:17:36.917 --> 00:17:40.917
we are not to be identified with one country

00:17:41.166 --> 00:17:43.166
- that our people should be married,

00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:45.583
that we should get our people there.

00:17:45.917 --> 00:17:48.166
All this kind of thing I have noticed,

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:50.083
and I feel very sorry

00:17:50.375 --> 00:17:53.792
that you have not understood the nature of Sahaja Yoga.

00:17:54.083 --> 00:17:59.083
Sahaja Yoga is a global thing. Absolutely global.

00:17:59.375 --> 00:18:03.917
It has nothing to do with one country or with one person.

00:18:04.166 --> 00:18:09.166
It's such a global thing that if you see the subtle side of it,

00:18:09.291 --> 00:18:11.709
it's very joy-giving.

00:18:13.083 --> 00:18:16.083
God Almighty has created this world as one.

00:18:16.417 --> 00:18:18.500
They might have United Nations,

00:18:18.709 --> 00:18:20.291
they might have this, they might have that,

00:18:20.625 --> 00:18:23.917
but still they are so much identified with their country

00:18:25.834 --> 00:18:28.417
that they cannot correct also that country.

00:18:28.709 --> 00:18:29.625
Now, for example,

00:18:29.917 --> 00:18:32.917
something is wrong with your country, they cannot.

00:18:33.834 --> 00:18:36.291
For them, everything is all right, first,

00:18:36.625 --> 00:18:38.999
because they are born in that particular country.

00:18:39.291 --> 00:18:41.500
Or they appreciate some other country,

00:18:41.834 --> 00:18:43.834
so they'll go on praising that country,

00:18:44.083 --> 00:18:47.208
to such an extent that they are destroyed

00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:50.083
and their ideas also destroy people.

00:18:50.917 --> 00:18:56.208
So best thing is to see the joke behind being

00:18:57.500 --> 00:18:59.709
identified with one country.

00:18:59.999 --> 00:19:01.917
There's a big joke about it.

00:19:02.208 --> 00:19:05.208
I enjoy it very much. Among sahaja yogis also I've seen,

00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:09.083
it's very common that they are identified with one country.

00:19:09.417 --> 00:19:11.500
If you are identified,

00:19:11.709 --> 00:19:14.291
then you should try to correct that country.

00:19:14.625 --> 00:19:16.834
You should try to correct those countrymen

00:19:17.125 --> 00:19:21.125
who are following a particular type of ideologies.

00:19:21.417 --> 00:19:22.959
They never see that,

00:19:23.208 --> 00:19:27.125
because they are so much involved with them,

00:19:27.417 --> 00:19:29.542
that they don't see what's wrong with them.

00:19:29.834 --> 00:19:31.959
They'll always see what's wrong with others.

00:19:32.208 --> 00:19:36.125
But I've seen those who are real sahaja yogis are very good.

00:19:36.834 --> 00:19:39.625
They tell me what's wrong in their own country.

00:19:39.959 --> 00:19:42.333
What's going wrong in their own country.

00:19:42.625 --> 00:19:44.834
What's the trouble in their own country.

00:19:45.125 --> 00:19:49.959
How the countrymen are. You see, very surprising!

00:19:50.208 --> 00:19:53.125
I was surprised how people told me

00:19:53.417 --> 00:19:58.417
that how some people who are in their country

00:19:58.750 --> 00:20:00.959
are so misidentified,

00:20:01.208 --> 00:20:05.333
and they are so against Sahaja Yoga in a subtle manner.

00:20:05.625 --> 00:20:08.959
I was surprised, how they felt it that way.

00:20:09.208 --> 00:20:12.000
They said, "Mother, see, they are not at all global."

00:20:12.333 --> 00:20:17.208
Once you become global, all your problems of provinces

00:20:17.542 --> 00:20:18.959
and things are finished.

00:20:19.208 --> 00:20:21.000
But that doesn't come into their head,

00:20:21.333 --> 00:20:23.000
that we have to be global.

00:20:23.333 --> 00:20:24.542
We are sahaja yogis,

00:20:24.875 --> 00:20:26.959
we cannot identify ourselves

00:20:27.250 --> 00:20:29.458
with one country or another country.

00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:32.959
If we do that, then we are still lacking

00:20:33.250 --> 00:20:36.875
in our universal personality.

00:20:37.125 --> 00:20:42.250
And this universal personality comes to us from Shri Ganesh.

00:20:42.875 --> 00:20:45.125
He's a universal personality,

00:20:45.458 --> 00:20:51.875
whether He is in India, whether He is in Italy or in England.

00:20:52.542 --> 00:20:56.041
What is that personality? Is innocence.

00:20:56.959 --> 00:21:03.667
Very innocence, very much innocent, and not only that,

00:21:03.959 --> 00:21:07.041
but he is a joy giving personality.

00:21:07.333 --> 00:21:12.125
All such people, who are joy giving, are recognized.

00:21:12.458 --> 00:21:15.125
It's not that the world doesn't recognize.

00:21:15.458 --> 00:21:18.041
They may not be knowing that they are global,

00:21:18.333 --> 00:21:20.250
but those who are global people,

00:21:20.542 --> 00:21:24.333
they write books on global ways,

00:21:24.667 --> 00:21:26.750
thinking about global things.

00:21:27.041 --> 00:21:30.458
And they can criticize also people of their own country,

00:21:30.750 --> 00:21:33.333
they can criticize people of their own clan,

00:21:33.667 --> 00:21:35.333
they can go on like that.

00:21:35.667 --> 00:21:39.166
But they can be slavish also to some other country

00:21:39.458 --> 00:21:41.375
and try to praise them too much.

00:21:41.667 --> 00:21:43.875
So, you are not to be slavish.

00:21:45.166 --> 00:21:47.667
You have to not to be identified.

00:21:47.999 --> 00:21:50.667
But you should be identified with your Self.

00:21:51.458 --> 00:21:55.166
And whatever your Self enjoys, that should be expressed.

00:21:55.458 --> 00:21:58.583
That is the sign that your Ganesha is there

00:21:58.875 --> 00:22:00.667
and that Ganesha's working out.

00:22:00.999 --> 00:22:03.875
It's very important for leaders to understand this.

00:22:04.166 --> 00:22:06.792
Because I've seen the way they are identified

00:22:07.667 --> 00:22:10.375
with their countrymen is sometimes shocking to Me.

00:22:10.667 --> 00:22:13.166
I'm really shocked, how could they be.

00:22:13.458 --> 00:22:15.583
They are not belonging to any country.

00:22:15.875 --> 00:22:19.583
They are no more. They are in the country of Shri Ganesha,

00:22:19.875 --> 00:22:22.458
which is the country of Love and Joy.

00:22:22.792 --> 00:22:25.583
If you cannot give joy and love,

00:22:25.875 --> 00:22:27.250
then there's something wrong with you.

00:22:28.667 --> 00:22:32.792
With this only, his quality, people become chaste.

00:22:33.375 --> 00:22:38.166
Because chastity is a very joy giving thing, very joy giving.

00:22:39.166 --> 00:22:42.083
It is not a thing that you have to tell somebody,

00:22:42.375 --> 00:22:45.291
or to force somebody, or to restrict somebody,

00:22:45.583 --> 00:22:49.583
but it is to enjoy it.

00:22:50.583 --> 00:22:54.500
To enjoy yourself and enjoy the chastity of another person.

00:22:54.792 --> 00:22:59.709
Is such a great blessing of Shri Ganesha,

00:23:00.583 --> 00:23:05.291
such a great blessing that you enjoy your own chastity.

00:23:05.583 --> 00:23:08.083
You are not bothered about the another person

00:23:08.375 --> 00:23:12.709
he's chaste or not, if he's doing bad things,

00:23:12.999 --> 00:23:14.917
if he's a ruined person, doesn't matter.

00:23:15.166 --> 00:23:17.291
You don't get spoilt with that.

00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:20.500
You have your own chastity,

00:23:20.792 --> 00:23:25.583
your own life of very chaste moments.

00:23:27.709 --> 00:23:31.917
It is nowadays such a modern style of

00:23:32.166 --> 00:23:34.375
thinking there's a flowing towards

00:23:34.709 --> 00:23:40.375
unchaste life and all kinds of wrong ideas about chastity.

00:23:40.709 --> 00:23:43.083
If somebody now talks of chastity,

00:23:43.375 --> 00:23:46.917
people think that this must be mad, how can that be?

00:23:47.166 --> 00:23:49.792
Everything is done these days, if you see,

00:23:50.083 --> 00:23:51.917
all the fashions are there.

00:23:52.166 --> 00:23:55.500
Now, once the fashion starts, it goes on spreading.

00:23:56.083 --> 00:23:58.709
Then, everybody will dress up in the same manner.

00:23:58.917 --> 00:24:00.709
They have no personality of their own.

00:24:00.999 --> 00:24:04.208
Everybody will be going round in the same manner,

00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:08.417
especially the women have lost their sense of chastity.

00:24:08.709 --> 00:24:10.999
They have lost their sense of chastity,

00:24:11.291 --> 00:24:14.083
because the way they dress up sometimes, shocks Me.

00:24:14.417 --> 00:24:16.709
What is the need to dress up like this?

00:24:16.999 --> 00:24:18.834
Why can't you dress up properly?

00:24:19.083 --> 00:24:22.208
But it is just, just…

00:24:23.291 --> 00:24:26.083
shows that they have no character of their own.

00:24:26.417 --> 00:24:29.291
Actually, they may say "I am this, I am that",

00:24:29.625 --> 00:24:30.999
but they are not, they are nothing.

00:24:31.291 --> 00:24:35.709
Because they take to all kinds of forces that run around.

00:24:36.834 --> 00:24:37.999
But look at the children.

00:24:38.291 --> 00:24:40.083
Children are not like that.

00:24:40.417 --> 00:24:43.999
They do not have all these funny ideas

00:24:44.291 --> 00:24:47.208
of impressing people with their unchaste life.

00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:50.834
None of them. On the contrary, children are very conscious

00:24:51.083 --> 00:24:54.208
and they want to become very chaste people.

00:24:56.291 --> 00:24:58.917
This has an effect on the eyes, I must say.

00:24:59.208 --> 00:25:01.417
Shri Ganesha acts through your eyes.

00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:04.542
How you look at a person is very important.

00:25:04.834 --> 00:25:08.625
I have seen people losing complete control over their eyes,

00:25:08.959 --> 00:25:11.625
they'll go on looking at this person, looking at another person,

00:25:11.959 --> 00:25:12.834
looking at another person,

00:25:13.417 --> 00:25:16.125
just for nothing at all, but it's a matter

00:25:16.417 --> 00:25:19.000
of no Ganesha control.

00:25:19.333 --> 00:25:21.834
And with this the eyes are spoilt.

00:25:22.125 --> 00:25:26.959
Spoilt means that you cannot look at anything concentratedly.

00:25:27.208 --> 00:25:29.959
Then, how can you penetrate into anything?

00:25:30.208 --> 00:25:35.000
Any penetration is possible only if you can really

00:25:36.417 --> 00:25:38.750
adjust your eyes in such a manner,

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:43.542
that you see something at that time for that time,

00:25:43.834 --> 00:25:47.333
and not go on shifting your eyes from one to another.

00:25:47.625 --> 00:25:51.000
It can mean anything, it can come from anything.

00:25:51.333 --> 00:25:57.834
That means Ganesha is the One who is a detector of our faults.

00:25:58.125 --> 00:26:00.750
For example, people have greed.

00:26:01.542 --> 00:26:05.333
So they will start seeing who's wearing what clothes,

00:26:05.625 --> 00:26:07.625
what clothes they should wear.

00:26:07.959 --> 00:26:11.333
If they have greed, then they'll see somebody has a nice house,

00:26:11.667 --> 00:26:13.667
"I should also have a nice house."

00:26:13.959 --> 00:26:16.542
But they never see the beauty of that house.

00:26:16.875 --> 00:26:21.750
They never see the actual essence of that house.

00:26:22.041 --> 00:26:24.750
But, just, they go on seeing that,

00:26:24.959 --> 00:26:26.750
"I should have this house, this kind,

00:26:26.959 --> 00:26:28.041
I should have that."

00:26:28.333 --> 00:26:30.333
They have no sense of beauty, I should say,

00:26:30.667 --> 00:26:32.542
they have only sense of possession.

00:26:32.875 --> 00:26:36.458
And that is such a bad thing to say,

00:26:36.667 --> 00:26:40.667
because sense of beauty is something so deep,

00:26:40.959 --> 00:26:46.125
and sense of possession is so grotesque, so aggressive.

00:26:46.458 --> 00:26:50.250
So, one should look at things from Ganesha's angle,

00:26:50.542 --> 00:26:53.125
how will He do it, how will He use it?

00:26:53.458 --> 00:26:56.542
You will learn from children, how they watch things,

00:26:56.875 --> 00:27:00.041
and how they work it out, how they think.

00:27:00.333 --> 00:27:02.959
You will be amazed, how sensible they are,

00:27:03.250 --> 00:27:05.333
and the, very sensible, things they talk.

00:27:05.667 --> 00:27:07.542
Like I met a child,

00:27:08.875 --> 00:27:12.125
so the child told me  "I love the moon."

00:27:12.458 --> 00:27:16.667
I said: "Alright. Now, what's wrong with the moon?"

00:27:16.875 --> 00:27:20.875
"Nothing, but it hides itself under the clouds all the time."

00:27:21.583 --> 00:27:24.458
So, I said "Why does he do that?"

00:27:24.792 --> 00:27:26.166
"Because he walks too much.

00:27:26.458 --> 00:27:29.583
So, he's tired and he has to rest alright.

00:27:29.875 --> 00:27:31.583
And that's why he does it.

00:27:31.875 --> 00:27:35.250
If he doesn't walk so much, if he keeps steady,

00:27:35.583 --> 00:27:37.166
he won't have to do it." Just imagine!

00:27:37.458 --> 00:27:40.667
A little child watching all these things!

00:27:40.999 --> 00:27:45.166
And, I mean, I was amazed how the little child

00:27:45.375 --> 00:27:47.999
knows what is right, what is wrong,

00:27:48.250 --> 00:27:49.792
what, how to behave,

00:27:49.875 --> 00:27:57.875
how to understand the proper way of doing things.

00:27:59.041 --> 00:28:00.792
They are not taught anything,

00:28:01.041 --> 00:28:02.375
they are not conditioned, nothing.

00:28:02.667 --> 00:28:04.875
But they know how to behave.

00:28:05.166 --> 00:28:08.875
And they are always looked after by the Divine.

00:28:09.792 --> 00:28:12.875
I have known children, who have fallen from great heights.

00:28:13.166 --> 00:28:14.792
Nothing happened to them!

00:28:16.041 --> 00:28:20.458
And also no snakes and all these things don't bite children.

00:28:21.458 --> 00:28:25.458
Even, they say, that tigers

00:28:25.667 --> 00:28:30.375
never try to eat children. What is it?

00:28:30.709 --> 00:28:32.500
What is so powerful about it,

00:28:32.792 --> 00:28:36.500
that children are so safe and allowed to grow?

00:28:36.792 --> 00:28:40.375
But then they grow into such horrible creatures

00:28:40.709 --> 00:28:44.083
who are unchaste,

00:28:45.375 --> 00:28:48.375
who are running after women or women running after men.

00:28:48.709 --> 00:28:50.375
Is a common play these days.

00:28:50.709 --> 00:28:53.375
And it is unbelievable how can

00:28:53.709 --> 00:28:56.500
people who are even sahaja yogis do this.

00:28:56.792 --> 00:28:58.166
Of course, they don't.

00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:01.792
But some of them they are still in this kind of a mess.

00:29:02.917 --> 00:29:06.166
So, when you have your Ganesha already established…

00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:09.375
Just before creating the whole Universe,

00:29:09.709 --> 00:29:12.709
the Mother created Shri Ganesha.

00:29:12.999 --> 00:29:16.583
If He's there, then life is very easy.

00:29:16.917 --> 00:29:19.583
Such a society is very easy to live.

00:29:19.917 --> 00:29:25.166
Such a friendship also is so easy.

00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:31.500
Because there's nothing that is possessiveness

00:29:31.583 --> 00:29:38.375
or any kind of a, you can call, perversity.

00:29:40.375 --> 00:29:43.500
When you have bad eyes for women,

00:29:43.834 --> 00:29:46.500
bad eyes for money,

00:29:46.834 --> 00:29:51.999
bad eyes for possessions, Ganesha is spoilt.

00:29:53.709 --> 00:29:56.291
He just knows how to enjoy.

00:29:57.291 --> 00:29:58.500
Enjoy everything.

00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:01.625
If it belongs to you, doesn't matter.

00:30:01.917 --> 00:30:04.208
It belongs to me, it doesn't matter.

00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:09.417
But you should know how to enjoy the beauty of it.

00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:15.709
And that enjoyment when you have within yourself,

00:30:15.999 --> 00:30:19.625
you don't grow old, because all the time you are enjoying!

00:30:19.917 --> 00:30:22.500
What is there to grow old?

00:30:22.834 --> 00:30:24.917
But normally, it doesn't happen.

00:30:25.208 --> 00:30:29.208
You are very critical, you are very,

00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:35.083
I should say, selfish, and stupid sometimes, very much stupid.

00:30:35.417 --> 00:30:42.500
all that you lose all that grip over your Self, which is joy.

00:30:43.834 --> 00:30:47.417
What is your Self? Self is nothing but joy!

00:30:47.709 --> 00:30:51.625
A joyous person is definitely a person

00:30:51.917 --> 00:30:56.625
who has got his Self expressing, through his joy.

00:30:56.917 --> 00:31:01.625
Such a person is so joy giving, so humorous.

00:31:02.208 --> 00:31:05.291
And never degrading anyone.

00:31:05.625 --> 00:31:08.999
In every small thing it sees a beauty.

00:31:09.333 --> 00:31:16.333
And nature of every creation is so beautiful.

00:31:16.625 --> 00:31:18.542
I'm really surprised,

00:31:18.834 --> 00:31:22.542
how is it that poetry comes to very few people…

00:31:22.834 --> 00:31:26.750
Because they go on describing love affairs, this, that,

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:31.333
all nonsensical things, and what things make you unhappy.

00:31:31.625 --> 00:31:36.834
Unhappy is not the sign of a person who is a realised soul.

00:31:37.125 --> 00:31:40.750
So, if you have that problem of unhappiness

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:42.333
just be on the watch out

00:31:42.542 --> 00:31:44.959
and see why, why have you developed

00:31:45.208 --> 00:31:49.000
this kind of a funny attitude towards everything.

00:31:49.333 --> 00:31:51.417
Why can't you enjoy everything?

00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:54.417
You go on watching this person, that person,

00:31:54.750 --> 00:31:55.959
you never enjoy.

00:31:56.208 --> 00:31:59.125
While if you watch the children, it's very interesting.

00:32:00.417 --> 00:32:03.750
They look at…Like I saw one joke.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:05.625
There was a joke about a child.

00:32:06.542 --> 00:32:09.125
They had a guest in their house for food,

00:32:09.417 --> 00:32:11.333
and he was eating.

00:32:13.125 --> 00:32:15.333
So this child saw that man eating.

00:32:15.625 --> 00:32:18.417
He said "Mama, he doesn't eat like a horse,

00:32:18.750 --> 00:32:20.417
you said he eats like a horse."

00:32:24.125 --> 00:32:28.041
So, that's what they are, very simple, very simple-hearted,

00:32:28.333 --> 00:32:31.458
and that's how they correct people. Correct.

00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:33.458
What you should talk to children,

00:32:33.667 --> 00:32:36.458
what you should tell them about is very important

00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:41.250
because if you tell them something "Don't do it!"

00:32:41.959 --> 00:32:44.250
So, they will do it in such a manner,

00:32:44.542 --> 00:32:48.250
that it will be ridiculous, absolutely ridiculous

00:32:48.542 --> 00:32:51.041
and they are so obedient, to begin with.

00:32:51.250 --> 00:32:53.875
They think that "We are children, we should obey."

00:32:54.125 --> 00:32:58.542
And this obedience comes out of their simple nature.

00:32:58.875 --> 00:33:01.959
But we should not try to tell them too many things,

00:33:02.875 --> 00:33:04.875
and we shouldn't like to control them

00:33:05.041 --> 00:33:08.542
with "Don't do this, don't do that!"

00:33:08.875 --> 00:33:10.875
All the time if you do it like that,

00:33:11.125 --> 00:33:12.458
the children won't understand.

00:33:12.667 --> 00:33:13.750
You don't have to tell them.

00:33:14.041 --> 00:33:15.959
But if they are chaste children,

00:33:16.250 --> 00:33:19.125
if they are brought up in a chaste society…

00:33:19.458 --> 00:33:22.667
That's why I always say "Baba, send your children to our school."

00:33:22.999 --> 00:33:25.667
Because children have to be chaste.

00:33:25.999 --> 00:33:28.792
They must understand the value of chastity.

00:33:29.041 --> 00:33:31.583
And these modern societies, in the Western

00:33:31.875 --> 00:33:36.792
area specially, are very destroying our children's innocence.

00:33:37.583 --> 00:33:40.375
We should have learned so much from the children,

00:33:40.667 --> 00:33:43.166
how innocent they are, how simple they are.

00:33:43.667 --> 00:33:45.667
They are very generous,

00:33:45.999 --> 00:33:49.375
and children will give away everything they have, everything.

00:33:49.667 --> 00:33:52.250
They don't understand possession of things.

00:33:52.583 --> 00:33:53.667
Just imagine.

00:33:54.166 --> 00:33:57.458
If somebody likes something, alright, have it.

00:33:57.792 --> 00:33:59.375
And they'll keep something

00:33:59.583 --> 00:34:01.875
for a person who likes something, you know.

00:34:02.166 --> 00:34:03.375
They are wonderful people.

00:34:03.667 --> 00:34:05.999
And we have to learn a lot from children.

00:34:06.999 --> 00:34:12.166
And their smiling faces and their joy

00:34:12.458 --> 00:34:14.583
should teach us how to behave.

00:34:14.875 --> 00:34:17.875
Because Ganesha shines through them very clearly.

00:34:18.583 --> 00:34:22.250
All the intelligence, all the beautiful things they say,

00:34:22.583 --> 00:34:24.667
I would say, you should all write it down

00:34:24.999 --> 00:34:26.583
- what your children talk, say.

00:34:26.917 --> 00:34:32.166
Because it would be such a book of interesting episodes,

00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:34.583
instead of writing about wars

00:34:34.917 --> 00:34:39.083
and horrible things that they have done in this world,

00:34:39.375 --> 00:34:41.291
better write what good things there are,

00:34:41.583 --> 00:34:42.917
which children can tell you.

00:34:43.166 --> 00:34:47.375
Children don't believe in all this kind of a mass

00:34:47.709 --> 00:34:49.917
nonsense of a fashion. They don't.

00:34:50.166 --> 00:34:52.999
See, they are properly dressed always,

00:34:53.291 --> 00:34:57.917
they are not bothered about behaving in the mass way.

00:34:58.166 --> 00:35:00.917
So, that means they are very independent, on their own.

00:35:01.166 --> 00:35:03.917
They are not slaves of any society.

00:35:04.166 --> 00:35:06.083
And they do not want

00:35:06.291 --> 00:35:09.709
to follow anything that is just generally followed, no.

00:35:09.999 --> 00:35:12.291
They follow their own pattern,

00:35:12.583 --> 00:35:15.291
and live in very dignified manner.

00:35:15.583 --> 00:35:20.291
They are extremely dignified and their sense of chastity

00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:22.291
is very well developed.

00:35:22.583 --> 00:35:25.917
They would not wear something that will expose their body,

00:35:26.166 --> 00:35:29.500
or will show that there's something wrong with them.

00:35:29.834 --> 00:35:32.166
Sometimes we neglect our children very much.

00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:35.208
Because of money problems, maybe, or I don't know

00:35:35.417 --> 00:35:37.291
what husband-wife problems there are,

00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:39.208
and the children are neglected.

00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:42.083
And once they are neglected,

00:35:42.417 --> 00:35:46.083
anything can happen to them and I think it's a very great sin

00:35:46.291 --> 00:35:49.834
on the part of people to produce children and to neglect them.

00:35:50.083 --> 00:35:53.083
Children should be given the first,

00:35:53.417 --> 00:35:56.834
the primary place in the household, in the family.

00:35:57.083 --> 00:36:00.083
And they should be looked after by everyone.

00:36:00.417 --> 00:36:02.083
They are the most important thing,

00:36:02.417 --> 00:36:04.834
not somebody, he's the head of the family,

00:36:05.083 --> 00:36:07.999
he can shout at the children and…nothing of the kind!

00:36:09.709 --> 00:36:11.834
Moreover, I have seen that

00:36:12.917 --> 00:36:17.083
the way we take to all odd things and bad habits,

00:36:17.417 --> 00:36:18.625
children never take.

00:36:18.917 --> 00:36:21.999
They know that it is bad, it should not be done.

00:36:22.291 --> 00:36:24.999
By their innocence they know it should not be done.

00:36:25.291 --> 00:36:27.291
They may sometimes, you know,

00:36:27.625 --> 00:36:29.625
play with fire, do something like that.

00:36:29.917 --> 00:36:32.917
But once they are bitten by it they'll never touch it.

00:36:33.208 --> 00:36:36.542
They are extremely fast in learning,

00:36:36.834 --> 00:36:41.000
because that is the age they are, they're growing.

00:36:41.333 --> 00:36:45.542
But actually, what is needed now, is that the elders must grow.

00:36:45.834 --> 00:36:48.208
The children are growing, they learn.

00:36:48.542 --> 00:36:49.834
What about the elders?

00:36:50.125 --> 00:36:52.208
They have to learn also

00:36:52.542 --> 00:36:55.417
how to be nice and kind to everyone.

00:36:55.750 --> 00:36:59.208
And to be compassionate with all the rest of them.

00:36:59.542 --> 00:37:05.417
This idea of criticism comes from where? I don't know.

00:37:05.750 --> 00:37:08.959
But like they'll go anywhere, they'll start criticising.

00:37:09.208 --> 00:37:10.750
Children never criticize.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:12.834
They never see these things, never.

00:37:13.125 --> 00:37:18.834
They'll just get into that house, or any place,

00:37:19.125 --> 00:37:22.959
and just enjoy it and see the good points of that house.

00:37:23.208 --> 00:37:24.834
Always I have seen they'll come and tell

00:37:24.959 --> 00:37:28.417
"See, they had one very nice Shri Ganesha's this thing."

00:37:28.750 --> 00:37:31.625
The house may be dirty, there might be smell,

00:37:31.959 --> 00:37:33.625
anything, doesn't matter.

00:37:33.959 --> 00:37:39.000
See, so their eyes are towards nice things and good things.

00:37:39.333 --> 00:37:43.333
They don't , sort of, take to all these things.

00:37:43.667 --> 00:37:47.125
Then, also, because of modern life, children

00:37:47.458 --> 00:37:50.750
have developed a kind of a funny characters,

00:37:51.041 --> 00:37:54.458
when they grow up: "I don't like this, I don't like that",

00:37:54.750 --> 00:37:58.750
and they fall into funny, funny, I should say,

00:37:58.959 --> 00:38:03.250
ideas about life, which we must try to guard.

00:38:03.542 --> 00:38:08.250
Because these days the society is growing so fast.

00:38:08.542 --> 00:38:12.250
There are televisions, there are so many, I should say,

00:38:16.750 --> 00:38:20.875
propagating things which are not good for children

00:38:21.125 --> 00:38:23.667
and they should not see them also.

00:38:23.959 --> 00:38:27.667
And if the children are realised souls, they don't like to see.

00:38:27.959 --> 00:38:30.041
They don't like to see violence.

00:38:30.333 --> 00:38:32.959
They don't like to see nonsense, I have seen it.

00:38:33.250 --> 00:38:34.959
They don't like.

00:38:35.250 --> 00:38:38.041
But the parents are sitting and enjoying nonsense,

00:38:38.333 --> 00:38:40.250
so they are also sitting. Gradually,

00:38:40.458 --> 00:38:42.041
it might crawl into their heads.

00:38:42.333 --> 00:38:45.458
But normally, children don't like any violence,

00:38:45.750 --> 00:38:47.458
and beating, any kind of thing.

00:38:47.750 --> 00:38:50.250
So, we have to learn a lot from them,

00:38:50.583 --> 00:38:52.166
because they are innocent,

00:38:52.375 --> 00:38:54.999
because they have the quality of innocence,

00:38:55.250 --> 00:38:56.875
so they are to be respected.

00:38:57.166 --> 00:39:01.667
I don't like people beating their children or hitting them

00:39:01.999 --> 00:39:04.792
and fulfilling their ambitions through the children.

00:39:04.999 --> 00:39:06.166
It's very, very wrong.

00:39:06.458 --> 00:39:08.875
You should leave them alone, they are perfect.

00:39:09.166 --> 00:39:11.375
Only thing is they should be given

00:39:11.667 --> 00:39:15.041
proper ideas at a time, appreciation

00:39:15.375 --> 00:39:18.041
for their chastity, for their well behaviour.

00:39:18.375 --> 00:39:19.583
That should be done.

00:39:19.875 --> 00:39:23.166
But should not be given a kind of

00:39:23.458 --> 00:39:26.458
idea of the society in which they live.

00:39:26.792 --> 00:39:28.458
Where the children get spoilt.

00:39:28.792 --> 00:39:31.583
And I was surprised that I'd met one child,

00:39:31.875 --> 00:39:37.041
the other day, and the child said:  "I want to have a car."

00:39:38.375 --> 00:39:40.667
"Which car?" "Mercedes."

00:39:40.999 --> 00:39:43.166
I said: "Why don't you go for a Ferrari?"

00:39:45.792 --> 00:39:48.041
So you see, this money orientation also

00:39:48.375 --> 00:39:49.583
comes from childhood.

00:39:50.583 --> 00:39:54.500
From childhood if you talk of all these things, money orientation,

00:39:54.792 --> 00:39:57.375
children also know this and they talk like that.

00:39:57.709 --> 00:39:59.500
There are many other things for children,

00:39:59.792 --> 00:40:01.083
we should just avoid.

00:40:01.375 --> 00:40:04.166
Don't allow them to go near all such things,

00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:07.500
which are creating money orientation

00:40:07.792 --> 00:40:09.917
because that is the problem of today,

00:40:10.166 --> 00:40:14.709
that everywhere you find people who have made money, illegally.

00:40:14.917 --> 00:40:16.166
So much money has been made.

00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:18.500
And there is no need to do that.

00:40:18.792 --> 00:40:22.166
But still, you see, they go, this money orientation is funny thing.

00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:25.999
It's a greed, it's a madness, I tell you, real madness.

00:40:26.291 --> 00:40:29.083
A person wants to have, say, 25 cars.

00:40:29.375 --> 00:40:31.500
Is he going to sit in the 25 cars?

00:40:31.792 --> 00:40:34.917
He wants to have 25 aeroplanes.

00:40:35.083 --> 00:40:36.166
What is he going to do with that?

00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:38.709
For that, he is cheating everyone,

00:40:38.999 --> 00:40:41.709
troubling everyone, taking the money of others.

00:40:41.999 --> 00:40:44.583
Is better to be poor, than to be like that.

00:40:44.917 --> 00:40:47.166
So, this is what is happening today

00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:51.417
is that people have gone…the track is wrong.

00:40:51.709 --> 00:40:54.917
Is the right side track, right side track.

00:40:55.208 --> 00:40:59.083
I should say, we start our Sahaja Yoga from Shri Ganesha,

00:40:59.417 --> 00:41:02.083
who is on the left side. Not on the right side.

00:41:02.291 --> 00:41:04.709
First, you developed your left side,

00:41:04.999 --> 00:41:07.208
then you come to right, you are alright.

00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:11.291
That's why we have our Sahaja Yoga completely built in

00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:13.083
on Shri Ganesh.

00:41:14.208 --> 00:41:17.208
Once he's there, you are completely alright

00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:20.500
and no problem. There's no lack of wisdom.

00:41:20.625 --> 00:41:23.208
Once you are with Shri Ganesh,

00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:27.834
you see the point, absolutely clearly,

00:41:28.083 --> 00:41:32.834
how to behave, how to live,

00:41:33.083 --> 00:41:37.834
and you don't take to stupid things like lust,

00:41:38.083 --> 00:41:39.291
greed and nonsense.

00:41:39.625 --> 00:41:41.417
But people are mad, you know,

00:41:41.625 --> 00:41:44.999
they take to any kind of thing when they grow up.

00:41:45.291 --> 00:41:47.917
But as children, if they have an influence,

00:41:48.208 --> 00:41:54.417
very beautiful influence of proper family life,

00:41:54.709 --> 00:42:00.834
proper school life, proper guidance,

00:42:01.083 --> 00:42:08.083
proper love and help in every way,

00:42:08.417 --> 00:42:12.834
in their growth, then children become extremely,

00:42:13.125 --> 00:42:15.542
extremely good, beautiful.

00:42:15.750 --> 00:42:19.750
And I bless all the Sahaja Yogis to have children

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:25.125
of that nature, and to look after your children.

00:42:25.417 --> 00:42:29.750
That's very important, because they are tomorrow's Sahaja Yogis.

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:32.834
And they should be of better quality.

00:42:33.125 --> 00:42:38.542
Because you are coming from another lot.

00:42:43.417 --> 00:42:46.125
They are coming from the innocence,

00:42:46.417 --> 00:42:50.208
so they are very pure,

00:42:50.542 --> 00:42:56.000
and their purity must be respected and must be guarded.

00:42:56.333 --> 00:43:00.959
Maybe that we'll understand the importance of children

00:43:01.208 --> 00:43:05.208
and develop Ganesha qualities in them.

00:43:05.542 --> 00:43:07.417
So, thank you very much
