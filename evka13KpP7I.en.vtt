WEBVTT

00:30.400 --> 00:33.999
Today we have gathered here

00:34.250 --> 00:36.625
to worship Shri Ganesha.

00:38.625 --> 00:43.542
Shri Ganesha is the Deity of innocence.

00:49.417 --> 00:51.834
When we are born as children,

00:54.041 --> 00:57.750
it is Shri Ganesha who is acting

00:58.750 --> 01:00.333
and we are very innocent,

01:03.875 --> 01:06.667
and it is such a powerful thing

01:07.542 --> 01:09.667
that, with this innocence,

01:11.250 --> 01:16.750
children survive under many circumstances.

01:23.542 --> 01:28.542
And we love them, because they are innocent.

01:29.875 --> 01:34.250
We enjoy them, because they are innocent.

01:38.333 --> 01:40.125
Once we start growing,

01:43.750 --> 01:46.667
our Sahastrara also gets closed

01:47.959 --> 01:52.667
and we develop all kinds of funny things

01:53.959 --> 01:58.250
that enters into us and doesn't go out.

02:00.125 --> 02:03.542
It's just there, it doesn't go out.

02:09.125 --> 02:14.041
Innocence has a great effect on our character

02:17.667 --> 02:21.959
and on our sense of chastity.

02:23.875 --> 02:25.333
Actually, when you are innocent,

02:25.542 --> 02:27.750
you don't know what is not chastity,

02:28.875 --> 02:34.542
what is being unchaste,

02:36.250 --> 02:43.959
what is being cunning.

02:45.250 --> 02:49.125
You are innocent and you are looked after

02:49.458 --> 02:52.333
by Shri Ganesha Himself.

02:53.458 --> 02:57.250
Anybody who tries to harm a innocent person,

02:58.166 --> 03:02.875
Shri Ganesha looks after you and manages you.

03:06.792 --> 03:09.792
Many people who are innocent in this world

03:10.999 --> 03:12.583
- of course there are very few -

03:14.041 --> 03:18.166
but they become so detached

03:18.458 --> 03:23.875
from all worldly problems,

03:24.875 --> 03:29.166
like lust and greed, and many other.

03:30.166 --> 03:32.250
Because they are so pure

03:33.667 --> 03:38.250
that nothing can spoil them and malign them.

03:39.999 --> 03:43.792
This is such a great blessings we have,

03:45.458 --> 03:51.041
that innocence is actually created in us,

03:52.375 --> 03:54.458
and it was created much before,

03:56.375 --> 03:57.999
all the innocence,

03:58.875 --> 04:01.999
everything was created much, much before

04:04.041 --> 04:05.250
we were created.

04:07.041 --> 04:13.250
It's such a great quality for us to become innocent.

04:16.875 --> 04:23.166
The greatest quality of Shri Ganesha is joy.

04:25.250 --> 04:29.583
It gives you joy, as small children,

04:30.875 --> 04:32.375
they may not speak even,

04:32.667 --> 04:34.250
but they give us so much joy.

04:35.500 --> 04:39.375
Joy giving quality comes from Shri Ganesha.

04:40.709 --> 04:43.291
Even after coming to Sahaja Yoga I've seen people

04:44.709 --> 04:46.291
are not full of joy.

04:46.917 --> 04:50.375
Are very serious, they don't know how to laugh,

04:51.166 --> 04:52.999
how to enjoy anything.

04:53.999 --> 04:57.583
That's the sign that they are still lacking in innocence.

04:59.709 --> 05:03.083
So it's important to understand

05:04.375 --> 05:05.917
that, if you are sahaja yogis,

05:07.166 --> 05:12.166
you should be joyous and give joy to others,

05:12.917 --> 05:16.166
just like children, how sweet they are.

05:16.917 --> 05:18.583
They may be newly born,

05:19.083 --> 05:21.291
but how much joy they give you.

05:21.792 --> 05:27.291
But supposing you do not have that capacity

05:28.917 --> 05:31.792
to enjoy the innocence of children,

05:32.083 --> 05:34.375
then nobody can help you.

05:34.917 --> 05:36.709
Ganesha cannot help you.

05:36.999 --> 05:41.999
Because that's the innate quality human beings have

05:42.792 --> 05:47.999
and if you don't have that quality,

05:48.709 --> 05:52.583
no use having any other sense.

05:53.291 --> 05:56.375
Like some people like food, they like colours,

05:56.583 --> 05:58.834
they like all other things.

05:59.417 --> 06:01.834
But if you don't have Shri Ganesh

06:02.083 --> 06:04.625
you cannot purely enjoy anything.

06:05.291 --> 06:08.083
So it is only Shri Ganesha's blessings

06:08.417 --> 06:13.208
that we really enjoy everything in its full measure.

06:13.999 --> 06:17.834
Otherwise, we start judging it,

06:19.625 --> 06:21.999
we start criticizing it,

06:22.999 --> 06:25.709
people raise so many things, questions.

06:26.917 --> 06:30.291
If you see something and it gives you joy,

06:30.917 --> 06:35.083
then you are supposed to give the explanation for that.

06:35.917 --> 06:39.208
As we have many critics in this world,

06:39.500 --> 06:44.500
and they are all the time criticizing one another.

06:45.834 --> 06:48.709
Now the critics are criticizing critics,

06:48.917 --> 06:50.083
that's the biggest problem.

06:50.417 --> 06:51.709
That's their job.

06:52.417 --> 06:55.500
Because Ganesha is not there.

06:56.291 --> 06:59.208
And they go on criticizing others,

06:59.834 --> 07:01.999
never criticizing themselves,

07:02.291 --> 07:04.625
and thinking no end of themselves.

07:05.083 --> 07:10.625
And with that, they create a very bad kind of a community,

07:11.333 --> 07:15.917
which is actually very harmful, it's very dangerous.

07:16.208 --> 07:21.834
It's like having some sort of a boil,

07:22.750 --> 07:28.333
or some sort of a septic thing in your body, in your being.

07:28.625 --> 07:32.208
So, if you cannot appreciate it,

07:32.333 --> 07:35.125
and if you cannot enjoy it,

07:35.417 --> 07:39.333
then Shri Ganesha is missing from you.

07:39.625 --> 07:43.542
You should be able to enjoy everything,

07:45.625 --> 07:50.417
and to enjoy your children, enjoy children of other people.

07:50.959 --> 07:58.750
That's the sign of your being completely blessed by Shri Ganesh.

08:00.542 --> 08:03.750
Now the beauty of Shri Ganesha is this,

08:04.000 --> 08:07.125
that it looks after your Kundalini.

08:07.417 --> 08:09.834
It guards your Kundalini.

08:10.125 --> 08:12.000
It guides your Kundalini.

08:12.333 --> 08:17.750
And throughout on all the chakras he had to bless you.

08:18.750 --> 08:22.542
If you don't have the blessings of Shri Ganesh,

08:22.834 --> 08:26.750
you'll be completely useless fellow as a sahaja yogi,

08:27.000 --> 08:31.417
because all the time you are seeing the bad points of others,

08:31.750 --> 08:34.333
all the time you are devoiding,

08:34.625 --> 08:39.417
I should say, you are getting into a problem,

08:41.208 --> 08:44.750
by which you cannot enjoy anything.

08:45.000 --> 08:49.667
By temperament you think you are very serious,

08:49.959 --> 08:53.750
you are very mature, you are very developed,

08:54.041 --> 08:55.750
but you are not innocent.

08:56.542 --> 09:00.250
Such a person gives such a headache to everyone.

09:00.542 --> 09:02.250
You know, if there's one like that,

09:02.542 --> 09:05.041
in the family, people want to get rid of him.

09:05.333 --> 09:10.959
So you should have the quality of Shri Ganesha

09:11.250 --> 09:16.125
which is of giving joy to others.

09:16.458 --> 09:20.542
Depends on how much joy you can give it to others.

09:20.875 --> 09:23.333
It doesn't want anything.

09:23.667 --> 09:27.667
Such a person won't say that "I must get this,

09:27.959 --> 09:29.875
I must have this position,

09:30.125 --> 09:33.750
I should be leader, I should be this and that", no.

09:34.542 --> 09:39.041
He just enjoys giving joy, joy to others,

09:39.333 --> 09:42.875
and being humorous, and kind,

09:43.125 --> 09:48.125
and never, never tries to insult anyone and hurt anyone.

09:48.458 --> 09:53.125
If such a person hurts, by mistake also,

09:53.458 --> 09:55.250
he goes on repenting about it.

09:55.542 --> 10:00.333
And hundred times he'll beg your pardon if he has hurt you.

10:00.667 --> 10:03.750
Such a happy person is a real sahaja yogi.

10:04.041 --> 10:07.875
That's the one we want to have all around.

10:08.166 --> 10:10.875
Those who have no hatred for anyone,

10:11.166 --> 10:13.250
no malice for anyone,

10:13.583 --> 10:15.667
and not finding faults with another,

10:15.999 --> 10:19.375
but trying to find what is the good point of that person,

10:19.667 --> 10:22.583
what is so special about that person.

10:22.875 --> 10:25.999
He's not bothered as to what colour you are,

10:26.250 --> 10:28.166
whether you are black or white,

10:28.458 --> 10:31.583
whether you are tall or short, it makes no difference.

10:31.875 --> 10:36.667
Because it is absolute. Absolute joy.

10:36.999 --> 10:40.667
And for this absolute joy, you don't criticize,

10:40.999 --> 10:47.583
and you don't try to find faults with others.

10:49.583 --> 10:51.458
Now, the problem is

10:51.792 --> 10:55.999
that people are getting very much advanced in this modern era,

10:56.250 --> 10:59.875
very advanced, and they are very much more advanced

11:00.166 --> 11:02.375
in criticizing others, I think.

11:02.667 --> 11:05.875
That's the maxim they have, is to criticize others.

11:06.166 --> 11:10.458
And, also, they have another very bad quality,

11:10.792 --> 11:14.999
to identify themselves with the country in which they live

11:15.250 --> 11:17.250
or with the family they are with.

11:17.583 --> 11:19.583
I have seen it creates such a problem.

11:20.166 --> 11:23.083
Also they identify themselves

11:23.291 --> 11:25.375
with the different religions they follow.

11:25.709 --> 11:29.291
Imagine, from this, how many problems have come out

11:29.583 --> 11:34.500
- that you start differentiating between one and another.

11:34.792 --> 11:38.291
For example, now supposing who is born say,

11:38.583 --> 11:42.917
in one place, so he says he's the best,

11:43.166 --> 11:45.500
his country is the best,

11:45.792 --> 11:47.500
his people are the best,

11:47.792 --> 11:50.083
and there's nothing wrong with them.

11:50.375 --> 11:56.583
On the contrary, if a person is a real sahaja yogi,

11:56.917 --> 12:00.291
who has Ganesha within him, enlightened,

12:00.583 --> 12:04.375
then he sees it and enjoys the humour behind it.

12:04.709 --> 12:07.709
The humour of all these people,

12:07.999 --> 12:10.999
what they are mad after, how they behave.

12:11.291 --> 12:15.583
I mean the way he understands the jokes behind it,

12:15.917 --> 12:18.709
jokes which is avoiding reality.

12:18.999 --> 12:21.709
And reality is only possible

12:21.999 --> 12:24.500
if you are in the realm of joy.

12:24.792 --> 12:29.500
Otherwise, all the time you find something

12:29.709 --> 12:32.083
wrong, something upsetting,

12:32.417 --> 12:33.999
so something disturbs you.

12:34.291 --> 12:40.917
But if you see the humour behind everything

12:41.208 --> 12:43.834
then you are perfectly alright.

12:45.834 --> 12:48.208
For example, I would say,

12:48.208 --> 12:51.625
that I have had many such experiences,

12:51.917 --> 12:54.709
that people have told me

12:54.999 --> 12:56.999
"Mother, such and such fellow is like that,

12:57.208 --> 12:58.208
such and such fellow is like that."

12:59.083 --> 13:03.417
So, I would ask that person:

13:03.709 --> 13:06.834
"Are you like that?" Direct.

13:07.083 --> 13:09.834
He said "No, I'm not like that".

13:10.083 --> 13:12.709
"But, I said, why everybody sees that in you?"

13:13.417 --> 13:15.083
"Must be wrong!"

13:15.417 --> 13:17.999
"All of them must be wrong or you are wrong?"

13:18.291 --> 13:21.208
Then he would say, "Maybe, myself."

13:21.500 --> 13:22.709
And that's how you see,

13:22.999 --> 13:25.917
you can mould also such people, who think

13:26.208 --> 13:29.625
that they are correct and the rest of the world is all bad,

13:29.917 --> 13:32.208
and they have every right to hate them

13:32.500 --> 13:35.709
and to think in the wrong direction.

13:36.000 --> 13:42.333
What happens with that is that you lose the essence of joy.

13:43.542 --> 13:46.625
Essence of joy is in seeing in everything,

13:46.959 --> 13:50.333
seeing in everything the source of joy.

13:51.542 --> 13:54.125
Supposing you see something here,

13:54.417 --> 13:57.959
now, if it is odd, it should give you

13:58.125 --> 14:00.333
also a great sense of humour.

14:00.625 --> 14:03.834
If it is beautiful, it should give you another

14:04.125 --> 14:05.417
sense, of appreciation.

14:05.750 --> 14:09.125
But I can't understand people who go on harping

14:09.417 --> 14:12.542
on some sort of a thing,

14:12.834 --> 14:14.959
that has no meaning in their lives

14:15.208 --> 14:17.208
nor in the lives of others.

14:19.333 --> 14:23.750
I would say my father had a great capacity to do that.

14:24.000 --> 14:29.000
Once, I went home, so I said this…

14:29.333 --> 14:32.625
"My brother was praising this man for his music,

14:32.834 --> 14:34.125
What do you think? His Friend"

14:34.417 --> 14:37.542
He said, "He is a musician, no doubt,

14:37.834 --> 14:39.959
but he is very courageous".

14:40.208 --> 14:41.208
I said: "Why?"

14:41.542 --> 14:44.333
"Because he may go on singing anything,

14:44.667 --> 14:48.333
he never feels bad about it. Everybody might be nervous,

14:48.667 --> 14:51.333
or everybody might be laughing at it,

14:51.667 --> 14:54.667
but he is not at all bothered.

14:54.959 --> 14:56.875
He goes on singing is his own ways."

14:57.125 --> 15:01.250
So, that is the beauty of understanding [that]

15:01.542 --> 15:04.750
every defect in a person can be enjoyed.

15:05.041 --> 15:10.542
Is very much a sense, I should say,

15:10.750 --> 15:15.959
a very subtle sense, by which you can enjoy every person.

15:16.250 --> 15:20.333
If he has defects, then you enjoy them as [a] humorous thing,

15:20.667 --> 15:23.458
and if he has something very good,

15:23.750 --> 15:25.125
then also you can enjoy.

15:25.458 --> 15:27.542
So why do you shun people?

15:27.875 --> 15:29.959
Why should you get out of people,

15:30.250 --> 15:31.959
criticize them for nothing at all?

15:32.125 --> 15:37.542
Now, under this, people have built up big organisations, you see.

15:37.875 --> 15:42.333
For examples, the Catholics will help (hate) the Protestants,

15:42.667 --> 15:45.667
the Protestants will help (hate),

15:45.959 --> 15:50.041
I mean not "help" I'm saying, they will also, sort of,

15:50.041 --> 15:54.041
hate the people who are Catholic.

15:54.333 --> 15:56.250
What's the use of that?

15:56.583 --> 16:00.166
What's the use of hating each other,

16:00.375 --> 16:03.250
from that point, that somebody is a Protestant

16:03.583 --> 16:05.375
and somebody is a Catholic?

16:05.667 --> 16:07.792
Just see yourself.

16:08.041 --> 16:09.999
See what is wrong with you!

16:10.250 --> 16:11.999
Why do you think like that?

16:12.250 --> 16:13.999
Why do you look at those things

16:14.250 --> 16:17.250
and always think that another person,

16:17.458 --> 16:19.166
something wrong with him.

16:19.375 --> 16:22.583
And then you form groups and then you fight,

16:22.875 --> 16:26.166
you can have even wars with this kind of an idea

16:26.458 --> 16:29.041
that the another person is not all right

16:29.667 --> 16:31.792
and you are absolutely perfect.

16:32.041 --> 16:34.375
This is also with the country, I have seen.

16:34.667 --> 16:37.250
For example, even in Sahaja Yoga I have seen

16:37.583 --> 16:40.375
if somebody is coming, say, from India

16:40.667 --> 16:43.166
or from another country anywhere,

16:43.458 --> 16:48.250
the leader will be anxious that he should or she should

16:48.583 --> 16:50.792
put her  candidate before Me.

16:51.583 --> 16:54.166
It's such an identification,

16:54.375 --> 16:57.583
which they are not still conscious of it.

16:57.875 --> 17:00.250
But then I play my tricks you see.

17:00.583 --> 17:02.500
All such thing when they do,

17:02.792 --> 17:06.500
when they try to support one party,

17:06.792 --> 17:09.083
one type of people, from one reli…,

17:09.375 --> 17:12.291
we should say not 'religion' now, but the countries.

17:12.583 --> 17:17.291
So, this country identification is so much still in Sahaja Yoga,

17:17.583 --> 17:19.917
that, you come from one country,

17:20.166 --> 17:23.375
then you want to support that man from that country.

17:24.083 --> 17:29.917
You'll never appreciate that whosoever is good,

17:30.166 --> 17:33.583
coming from any country, is a Sahaja Yogi.

17:34.709 --> 17:36.583
We are a global community,

17:36.917 --> 17:40.917
we are not to be identified with one country

17:41.166 --> 17:43.166
- that our people should be married,

17:43.500 --> 17:45.583
that we should get our people there.

17:45.917 --> 17:48.166
All this kind of thing I have noticed,

17:48.500 --> 17:50.083
and I feel very sorry

17:50.375 --> 17:53.792
that you have not understood the nature of Sahaja Yoga.

17:54.083 --> 17:59.083
Sahaja Yoga is a global thing. Absolutely global.

17:59.375 --> 18:03.917
It has nothing to do with one country or with one person.

18:04.166 --> 18:09.166
It's such a global thing that if you see the subtle side of it,

18:09.291 --> 18:11.709
it's very joy-giving.

18:13.083 --> 18:16.083
God Almighty has created this world as one.

18:16.417 --> 18:18.500
They might have United Nations,

18:18.709 --> 18:20.291
they might have this, they might have that,

18:20.625 --> 18:23.917
but still they are so much identified with their country

18:25.834 --> 18:28.417
that they cannot correct also that country.

18:28.709 --> 18:29.625
Now, for example,

18:29.917 --> 18:32.917
something is wrong with your country, they cannot.

18:33.834 --> 18:36.291
For them, everything is all right, first,

18:36.625 --> 18:38.999
because they are born in that particular country.

18:39.291 --> 18:41.500
Or they appreciate some other country,

18:41.834 --> 18:43.834
so they'll go on praising that country,

18:44.083 --> 18:47.208
to such an extent that they are destroyed

18:47.500 --> 18:50.083
and their ideas also destroy people.

18:50.917 --> 18:56.208
So best thing is to see the joke behind being

18:57.500 --> 18:59.709
identified with one country.

18:59.999 --> 19:01.917
There's a big joke about it.

19:02.208 --> 19:05.208
I enjoy it very much. Among sahaja yogis also I've seen,

19:05.500 --> 19:09.083
it's very common that they are identified with one country.

19:09.417 --> 19:11.500
If you are identified,

19:11.709 --> 19:14.291
then you should try to correct that country.

19:14.625 --> 19:16.834
You should try to correct those countrymen

19:17.125 --> 19:21.125
who are following a particular type of ideologies.

19:21.417 --> 19:22.959
They never see that,

19:23.208 --> 19:27.125
because they are so much involved with them,

19:27.417 --> 19:29.542
that they don't see what's wrong with them.

19:29.834 --> 19:31.959
They'll always see what's wrong with others.

19:32.208 --> 19:36.125
But I've seen those who are real sahaja yogis are very good.

19:36.834 --> 19:39.625
They tell me what's wrong in their own country.

19:39.959 --> 19:42.333
What's going wrong in their own country.

19:42.625 --> 19:44.834
What's the trouble in their own country.

19:45.125 --> 19:49.959
How the countrymen are. You see, very surprising!

19:50.208 --> 19:53.125
I was surprised how people told me

19:53.417 --> 19:58.417
that how some people who are in their country

19:58.750 --> 20:00.959
are so misidentified,

20:01.208 --> 20:05.333
and they are so against Sahaja Yoga in a subtle manner.

20:05.625 --> 20:08.959
I was surprised, how they felt it that way.

20:09.208 --> 20:12.000
They said, "Mother, see, they are not at all global."

20:12.333 --> 20:17.208
Once you become global, all your problems of provinces

20:17.542 --> 20:18.959
and things are finished.

20:19.208 --> 20:21.000
But that doesn't come into their head,

20:21.333 --> 20:23.000
that we have to be global.

20:23.333 --> 20:24.542
We are sahaja yogis,

20:24.875 --> 20:26.959
we cannot identify ourselves

20:27.250 --> 20:29.458
with one country or another country.

20:29.750 --> 20:32.959
If we do that, then we are still lacking

20:33.250 --> 20:36.875
in our universal personality.

20:37.125 --> 20:42.250
And this universal personality comes to us from Shri Ganesh.

20:42.875 --> 20:45.125
He's a universal personality,

20:45.458 --> 20:51.875
whether He is in India, whether He is in Italy or in England.

20:52.542 --> 20:56.041
What is that personality? Is innocence.

20:56.959 --> 21:03.667
Very innocence, very much innocent, and not only that,

21:03.959 --> 21:07.041
but he is a joy giving personality.

21:07.333 --> 21:12.125
All such people, who are joy giving, are recognized.

21:12.458 --> 21:15.125
It's not that the world doesn't recognize.

21:15.458 --> 21:18.041
They may not be knowing that they are global,

21:18.333 --> 21:20.250
but those who are global people,

21:20.542 --> 21:24.333
they write books on global ways,

21:24.667 --> 21:26.750
thinking about global things.

21:27.041 --> 21:30.458
And they can criticize also people of their own country,

21:30.750 --> 21:33.333
they can criticize people of their own clan,

21:33.667 --> 21:35.333
they can go on like that.

21:35.667 --> 21:39.166
But they can be slavish also to some other country

21:39.458 --> 21:41.375
and try to praise them too much.

21:41.667 --> 21:43.875
So, you are not to be slavish.

21:45.166 --> 21:47.667
You have to not to be identified.

21:47.999 --> 21:50.667
But you should be identified with your Self.

21:51.458 --> 21:55.166
And whatever your Self enjoys, that should be expressed.

21:55.458 --> 21:58.583
That is the sign that your Ganesha is there

21:58.875 --> 22:00.667
and that Ganesha's working out.

22:00.999 --> 22:03.875
It's very important for leaders to understand this.

22:04.166 --> 22:06.792
Because I've seen the way they are identified

22:07.667 --> 22:10.375
with their countrymen is sometimes shocking to Me.

22:10.667 --> 22:13.166
I'm really shocked, how could they be.

22:13.458 --> 22:15.583
They are not belonging to any country.

22:15.875 --> 22:19.583
They are no more. They are in the country of Shri Ganesha,

22:19.875 --> 22:22.458
which is the country of Love and Joy.

22:22.792 --> 22:25.583
If you cannot give joy and love,

22:25.875 --> 22:27.250
then there's something wrong with you.

22:28.667 --> 22:32.792
With this only, his quality, people become chaste.

22:33.375 --> 22:38.166
Because chastity is a very joy giving thing, very joy giving.

22:39.166 --> 22:42.083
It is not a thing that you have to tell somebody,

22:42.375 --> 22:45.291
or to force somebody, or to restrict somebody,

22:45.583 --> 22:49.583
but it is to enjoy it.

22:50.583 --> 22:54.500
To enjoy yourself and enjoy the chastity of another person.

22:54.792 --> 22:59.709
Is such a great blessing of Shri Ganesha,

23:00.583 --> 23:05.291
such a great blessing that you enjoy your own chastity.

23:05.583 --> 23:08.083
You are not bothered about the another person

23:08.375 --> 23:12.709
he's chaste or not, if he's doing bad things,

23:12.999 --> 23:14.917
if he's a ruined person, doesn't matter.

23:15.166 --> 23:17.291
You don't get spoilt with that.

23:17.500 --> 23:20.500
You have your own chastity,

23:20.792 --> 23:25.583
your own life of very chaste moments.

23:27.709 --> 23:31.917
It is nowadays such a modern style of

23:32.166 --> 23:34.375
thinking there's a flowing towards

23:34.709 --> 23:40.375
unchaste life and all kinds of wrong ideas about chastity.

23:40.709 --> 23:43.083
If somebody now talks of chastity,

23:43.375 --> 23:46.917
people think that this must be mad, how can that be?

23:47.166 --> 23:49.792
Everything is done these days, if you see,

23:50.083 --> 23:51.917
all the fashions are there.

23:52.166 --> 23:55.500
Now, once the fashion starts, it goes on spreading.

23:56.083 --> 23:58.709
Then, everybody will dress up in the same manner.

23:58.917 --> 24:00.709
They have no personality of their own.

24:00.999 --> 24:04.208
Everybody will be going round in the same manner,

24:04.500 --> 24:08.417
especially the women have lost their sense of chastity.

24:08.709 --> 24:10.999
They have lost their sense of chastity,

24:11.291 --> 24:14.083
because the way they dress up sometimes, shocks Me.

24:14.417 --> 24:16.709
What is the need to dress up like this?

24:16.999 --> 24:18.834
Why can't you dress up properly?

24:19.083 --> 24:22.208
But it is just, just…

24:23.291 --> 24:26.083
shows that they have no character of their own.

24:26.417 --> 24:29.291
Actually, they may say "I am this, I am that",

24:29.625 --> 24:30.999
but they are not, they are nothing.

24:31.291 --> 24:35.709
Because they take to all kinds of forces that run around.

24:36.834 --> 24:37.999
But look at the children.

24:38.291 --> 24:40.083
Children are not like that.

24:40.417 --> 24:43.999
They do not have all these funny ideas

24:44.291 --> 24:47.208
of impressing people with their unchaste life.

24:47.500 --> 24:50.834
None of them. On the contrary, children are very conscious

24:51.083 --> 24:54.208
and they want to become very chaste people.

24:56.291 --> 24:58.917
This has an effect on the eyes, I must say.

24:59.208 --> 25:01.417
Shri Ganesha acts through your eyes.

25:01.750 --> 25:04.542
How you look at a person is very important.

25:04.834 --> 25:08.625
I have seen people losing complete control over their eyes,

25:08.959 --> 25:11.625
they'll go on looking at this person, looking at another person,

25:11.959 --> 25:12.834
looking at another person,

25:13.417 --> 25:16.125
just for nothing at all, but it's a matter

25:16.417 --> 25:19.000
of no Ganesha control.

25:19.333 --> 25:21.834
And with this the eyes are spoilt.

25:22.125 --> 25:26.959
Spoilt means that you cannot look at anything concentratedly.

25:27.208 --> 25:29.959
Then, how can you penetrate into anything?

25:30.208 --> 25:35.000
Any penetration is possible only if you can really

25:36.417 --> 25:38.750
adjust your eyes in such a manner,

25:39.000 --> 25:43.542
that you see something at that time for that time,

25:43.834 --> 25:47.333
and not go on shifting your eyes from one to another.

25:47.625 --> 25:51.000
It can mean anything, it can come from anything.

25:51.333 --> 25:57.834
That means Ganesha is the One who is a detector of our faults.

25:58.125 --> 26:00.750
For example, people have greed.

26:01.542 --> 26:05.333
So they will start seeing who's wearing what clothes,

26:05.625 --> 26:07.625
what clothes they should wear.

26:07.959 --> 26:11.333
If they have greed, then they'll see somebody has a nice house,

26:11.667 --> 26:13.667
"I should also have a nice house."

26:13.959 --> 26:16.542
But they never see the beauty of that house.

26:16.875 --> 26:21.750
They never see the actual essence of that house.

26:22.041 --> 26:24.750
But, just, they go on seeing that,

26:24.959 --> 26:26.750
"I should have this house, this kind,

26:26.959 --> 26:28.041
I should have that."

26:28.333 --> 26:30.333
They have no sense of beauty, I should say,

26:30.667 --> 26:32.542
they have only sense of possession.

26:32.875 --> 26:36.458
And that is such a bad thing to say,

26:36.667 --> 26:40.667
because sense of beauty is something so deep,

26:40.959 --> 26:46.125
and sense of possession is so grotesque, so aggressive.

26:46.458 --> 26:50.250
So, one should look at things from Ganesha's angle,

26:50.542 --> 26:53.125
how will He do it, how will He use it?

26:53.458 --> 26:56.542
You will learn from children, how they watch things,

26:56.875 --> 27:00.041
and how they work it out, how they think.

27:00.333 --> 27:02.959
You will be amazed, how sensible they are,

27:03.250 --> 27:05.333
and the, very sensible, things they talk.

27:05.667 --> 27:07.542
Like I met a child,

27:08.875 --> 27:12.125
so the child told me  "I love the moon."

27:12.458 --> 27:16.667
I said: "Alright. Now, what's wrong with the moon?"

27:16.875 --> 27:20.875
"Nothing, but it hides itself under the clouds all the time."

27:21.583 --> 27:24.458
So, I said "Why does he do that?"

27:24.792 --> 27:26.166
"Because he walks too much.

27:26.458 --> 27:29.583
So, he's tired and he has to rest alright.

27:29.875 --> 27:31.583
And that's why he does it.

27:31.875 --> 27:35.250
If he doesn't walk so much, if he keeps steady,

27:35.583 --> 27:37.166
he won't have to do it." Just imagine!

27:37.458 --> 27:40.667
A little child watching all these things!

27:40.999 --> 27:45.166
And, I mean, I was amazed how the little child

27:45.375 --> 27:47.999
knows what is right, what is wrong,

27:48.250 --> 27:49.792
what, how to behave,

27:49.875 --> 27:57.875
how to understand the proper way of doing things.

27:59.041 --> 28:00.792
They are not taught anything,

28:01.041 --> 28:02.375
they are not conditioned, nothing.

28:02.667 --> 28:04.875
But they know how to behave.

28:05.166 --> 28:08.875
And they are always looked after by the Divine.

28:09.792 --> 28:12.875
I have known children, who have fallen from great heights.

28:13.166 --> 28:14.792
Nothing happened to them!

28:16.041 --> 28:20.458
And also no snakes and all these things don't bite children.

28:21.458 --> 28:25.458
Even, they say, that tigers

28:25.667 --> 28:30.375
never try to eat children. What is it?

28:30.709 --> 28:32.500
What is so powerful about it,

28:32.792 --> 28:36.500
that children are so safe and allowed to grow?

28:36.792 --> 28:40.375
But then they grow into such horrible creatures

28:40.709 --> 28:44.083
who are unchaste,

28:45.375 --> 28:48.375
who are running after women or women running after men.

28:48.709 --> 28:50.375
Is a common play these days.

28:50.709 --> 28:53.375
And it is unbelievable how can

28:53.709 --> 28:56.500
people who are even sahaja yogis do this.

28:56.792 --> 28:58.166
Of course, they don't.

28:58.500 --> 29:01.792
But some of them they are still in this kind of a mess.

29:02.917 --> 29:06.166
So, when you have your Ganesha already established…

29:06.500 --> 29:09.375
Just before creating the whole Universe,

29:09.709 --> 29:12.709
the Mother created Shri Ganesha.

29:12.999 --> 29:16.583
If He's there, then life is very easy.

29:16.917 --> 29:19.583
Such a society is very easy to live.

29:19.917 --> 29:25.166
Such a friendship also is so easy.

29:25.500 --> 29:31.500
Because there's nothing that is possessiveness

29:31.583 --> 29:38.375
or any kind of a, you can call, perversity.

29:40.375 --> 29:43.500
When you have bad eyes for women,

29:43.834 --> 29:46.500
bad eyes for money,

29:46.834 --> 29:51.999
bad eyes for possessions, Ganesha is spoilt.

29:53.709 --> 29:56.291
He just knows how to enjoy.

29:57.291 --> 29:58.500
Enjoy everything.

29:59.500 --> 30:01.625
If it belongs to you, doesn't matter.

30:01.917 --> 30:04.208
It belongs to me, it doesn't matter.

30:04.500 --> 30:09.417
But you should know how to enjoy the beauty of it.

30:10.500 --> 30:15.709
And that enjoyment when you have within yourself,

30:15.999 --> 30:19.625
you don't grow old, because all the time you are enjoying!

30:19.917 --> 30:22.500
What is there to grow old?

30:22.834 --> 30:24.917
But normally, it doesn't happen.

30:25.208 --> 30:29.208
You are very critical, you are very,

30:29.500 --> 30:35.083
I should say, selfish, and stupid sometimes, very much stupid.

30:35.417 --> 30:42.500
all that you lose all that grip over your Self, which is joy.

30:43.834 --> 30:47.417
What is your Self? Self is nothing but joy!

30:47.709 --> 30:51.625
A joyous person is definitely a person

30:51.917 --> 30:56.625
who has got his Self expressing, through his joy.

30:56.917 --> 31:01.625
Such a person is so joy giving, so humorous.

31:02.208 --> 31:05.291
And never degrading anyone.

31:05.625 --> 31:08.999
In every small thing it sees a beauty.

31:09.333 --> 31:16.333
And nature of every creation is so beautiful.

31:16.625 --> 31:18.542
I'm really surprised,

31:18.834 --> 31:22.542
how is it that poetry comes to very few people…

31:22.834 --> 31:26.750
Because they go on describing love affairs, this, that,

31:27.000 --> 31:31.333
all nonsensical things, and what things make you unhappy.

31:31.625 --> 31:36.834
Unhappy is not the sign of a person who is a realised soul.

31:37.125 --> 31:40.750
So, if you have that problem of unhappiness

31:41.000 --> 31:42.333
just be on the watch out

31:42.542 --> 31:44.959
and see why, why have you developed

31:45.208 --> 31:49.000
this kind of a funny attitude towards everything.

31:49.333 --> 31:51.417
Why can't you enjoy everything?

31:51.750 --> 31:54.417
You go on watching this person, that person,

31:54.750 --> 31:55.959
you never enjoy.

31:56.208 --> 31:59.125
While if you watch the children, it's very interesting.

32:00.417 --> 32:03.750
They look at…Like I saw one joke.

32:04.000 --> 32:05.625
There was a joke about a child.

32:06.542 --> 32:09.125
They had a guest in their house for food,

32:09.417 --> 32:11.333
and he was eating.

32:13.125 --> 32:15.333
So this child saw that man eating.

32:15.625 --> 32:18.417
He said "Mama, he doesn't eat like a horse,

32:18.750 --> 32:20.417
you said he eats like a horse."

32:24.125 --> 32:28.041
So, that's what they are, very simple, very simple-hearted,

32:28.333 --> 32:31.458
and that's how they correct people. Correct.

32:31.750 --> 32:33.458
What you should talk to children,

32:33.667 --> 32:36.458
what you should tell them about is very important

32:36.750 --> 32:41.250
because if you tell them something "Don't do it!"

32:41.959 --> 32:44.250
So, they will do it in such a manner,

32:44.542 --> 32:48.250
that it will be ridiculous, absolutely ridiculous

32:48.542 --> 32:51.041
and they are so obedient, to begin with.

32:51.250 --> 32:53.875
They think that "We are children, we should obey."

32:54.125 --> 32:58.542
And this obedience comes out of their simple nature.

32:58.875 --> 33:01.959
But we should not try to tell them too many things,

33:02.875 --> 33:04.875
and we shouldn't like to control them

33:05.041 --> 33:08.542
with "Don't do this, don't do that!"

33:08.875 --> 33:10.875
All the time if you do it like that,

33:11.125 --> 33:12.458
the children won't understand.

33:12.667 --> 33:13.750
You don't have to tell them.

33:14.041 --> 33:15.959
But if they are chaste children,

33:16.250 --> 33:19.125
if they are brought up in a chaste society…

33:19.458 --> 33:22.667
That's why I always say "Baba, send your children to our school."

33:22.999 --> 33:25.667
Because children have to be chaste.

33:25.999 --> 33:28.792
They must understand the value of chastity.

33:29.041 --> 33:31.583
And these modern societies, in the Western

33:31.875 --> 33:36.792
area specially, are very destroying our children's innocence.

33:37.583 --> 33:40.375
We should have learned so much from the children,

33:40.667 --> 33:43.166
how innocent they are, how simple they are.

33:43.667 --> 33:45.667
They are very generous,

33:45.999 --> 33:49.375
and children will give away everything they have, everything.

33:49.667 --> 33:52.250
They don't understand possession of things.

33:52.583 --> 33:53.667
Just imagine.

33:54.166 --> 33:57.458
If somebody likes something, alright, have it.

33:57.792 --> 33:59.375
And they'll keep something

33:59.583 --> 34:01.875
for a person who likes something, you know.

34:02.166 --> 34:03.375
They are wonderful people.

34:03.667 --> 34:05.999
And we have to learn a lot from children.

34:06.999 --> 34:12.166
And their smiling faces and their joy

34:12.458 --> 34:14.583
should teach us how to behave.

34:14.875 --> 34:17.875
Because Ganesha shines through them very clearly.

34:18.583 --> 34:22.250
All the intelligence, all the beautiful things they say,

34:22.583 --> 34:24.667
I would say, you should all write it down

34:24.999 --> 34:26.583
- what your children talk, say.

34:26.917 --> 34:32.166
Because it would be such a book of interesting episodes,

34:32.500 --> 34:34.583
instead of writing about wars

34:34.917 --> 34:39.083
and horrible things that they have done in this world,

34:39.375 --> 34:41.291
better write what good things there are,

34:41.583 --> 34:42.917
which children can tell you.

34:43.166 --> 34:47.375
Children don't believe in all this kind of a mass

34:47.709 --> 34:49.917
nonsense of a fashion. They don't.

34:50.166 --> 34:52.999
See, they are properly dressed always,

34:53.291 --> 34:57.917
they are not bothered about behaving in the mass way.

34:58.166 --> 35:00.917
So, that means they are very independent, on their own.

35:01.166 --> 35:03.917
They are not slaves of any society.

35:04.166 --> 35:06.083
And they do not want

35:06.291 --> 35:09.709
to follow anything that is just generally followed, no.

35:09.999 --> 35:12.291
They follow their own pattern,

35:12.583 --> 35:15.291
and live in very dignified manner.

35:15.583 --> 35:20.291
They are extremely dignified and their sense of chastity

35:20.500 --> 35:22.291
is very well developed.

35:22.583 --> 35:25.917
They would not wear something that will expose their body,

35:26.166 --> 35:29.500
or will show that there's something wrong with them.

35:29.834 --> 35:32.166
Sometimes we neglect our children very much.

35:32.500 --> 35:35.208
Because of money problems, maybe, or I don't know

35:35.417 --> 35:37.291
what husband-wife problems there are,

35:37.500 --> 35:39.208
and the children are neglected.

35:39.500 --> 35:42.083
And once they are neglected,

35:42.417 --> 35:46.083
anything can happen to them and I think it's a very great sin

35:46.291 --> 35:49.834
on the part of people to produce children and to neglect them.

35:50.083 --> 35:53.083
Children should be given the first,

35:53.417 --> 35:56.834
the primary place in the household, in the family.

35:57.083 --> 36:00.083
And they should be looked after by everyone.

36:00.417 --> 36:02.083
They are the most important thing,

36:02.417 --> 36:04.834
not somebody, he's the head of the family,

36:05.083 --> 36:07.999
he can shout at the children and…nothing of the kind!

36:09.709 --> 36:11.834
Moreover, I have seen that

36:12.917 --> 36:17.083
the way we take to all odd things and bad habits,

36:17.417 --> 36:18.625
children never take.

36:18.917 --> 36:21.999
They know that it is bad, it should not be done.

36:22.291 --> 36:24.999
By their innocence they know it should not be done.

36:25.291 --> 36:27.291
They may sometimes, you know,

36:27.625 --> 36:29.625
play with fire, do something like that.

36:29.917 --> 36:32.917
But once they are bitten by it they'll never touch it.

36:33.208 --> 36:36.542
They are extremely fast in learning,

36:36.834 --> 36:41.000
because that is the age they are, they're growing.

36:41.333 --> 36:45.542
But actually, what is needed now, is that the elders must grow.

36:45.834 --> 36:48.208
The children are growing, they learn.

36:48.542 --> 36:49.834
What about the elders?

36:50.125 --> 36:52.208
They have to learn also

36:52.542 --> 36:55.417
how to be nice and kind to everyone.

36:55.750 --> 36:59.208
And to be compassionate with all the rest of them.

36:59.542 --> 37:05.417
This idea of criticism comes from where? I don't know.

37:05.750 --> 37:08.959
But like they'll go anywhere, they'll start criticising.

37:09.208 --> 37:10.750
Children never criticize.

37:11.000 --> 37:12.834
They never see these things, never.

37:13.125 --> 37:18.834
They'll just get into that house, or any place,

37:19.125 --> 37:22.959
and just enjoy it and see the good points of that house.

37:23.208 --> 37:24.834
Always I have seen they'll come and tell

37:24.959 --> 37:28.417
"See, they had one very nice Shri Ganesha's this thing."

37:28.750 --> 37:31.625
The house may be dirty, there might be smell,

37:31.959 --> 37:33.625
anything, doesn't matter.

37:33.959 --> 37:39.000
See, so their eyes are towards nice things and good things.

37:39.333 --> 37:43.333
They don't , sort of, take to all these things.

37:43.667 --> 37:47.125
Then, also, because of modern life, children

37:47.458 --> 37:50.750
have developed a kind of a funny characters,

37:51.041 --> 37:54.458
when they grow up: "I don't like this, I don't like that",

37:54.750 --> 37:58.750
and they fall into funny, funny, I should say,

37:58.959 --> 38:03.250
ideas about life, which we must try to guard.

38:03.542 --> 38:08.250
Because these days the society is growing so fast.

38:08.542 --> 38:12.250
There are televisions, there are so many, I should say,

38:16.750 --> 38:20.875
propagating things which are not good for children

38:21.125 --> 38:23.667
and they should not see them also.

38:23.959 --> 38:27.667
And if the children are realised souls, they don't like to see.

38:27.959 --> 38:30.041
They don't like to see violence.

38:30.333 --> 38:32.959
They don't like to see nonsense, I have seen it.

38:33.250 --> 38:34.959
They don't like.

38:35.250 --> 38:38.041
But the parents are sitting and enjoying nonsense,

38:38.333 --> 38:40.250
so they are also sitting. Gradually,

38:40.458 --> 38:42.041
it might crawl into their heads.

38:42.333 --> 38:45.458
But normally, children don't like any violence,

38:45.750 --> 38:47.458
and beating, any kind of thing.

38:47.750 --> 38:50.250
So, we have to learn a lot from them,

38:50.583 --> 38:52.166
because they are innocent,

38:52.375 --> 38:54.999
because they have the quality of innocence,

38:55.250 --> 38:56.875
so they are to be respected.

38:57.166 --> 39:01.667
I don't like people beating their children or hitting them

39:01.999 --> 39:04.792
and fulfilling their ambitions through the children.

39:04.999 --> 39:06.166
It's very, very wrong.

39:06.458 --> 39:08.875
You should leave them alone, they are perfect.

39:09.166 --> 39:11.375
Only thing is they should be given

39:11.667 --> 39:15.041
proper ideas at a time, appreciation

39:15.375 --> 39:18.041
for their chastity, for their well behaviour.

39:18.375 --> 39:19.583
That should be done.

39:19.875 --> 39:23.166
But should not be given a kind of

39:23.458 --> 39:26.458
idea of the society in which they live.

39:26.792 --> 39:28.458
Where the children get spoilt.

39:28.792 --> 39:31.583
And I was surprised that I'd met one child,

39:31.875 --> 39:37.041
the other day, and the child said:  "I want to have a car."

39:38.375 --> 39:40.667
"Which car?" "Mercedes."

39:40.999 --> 39:43.166
I said: "Why don't you go for a Ferrari?"

39:45.792 --> 39:48.041
So you see, this money orientation also

39:48.375 --> 39:49.583
comes from childhood.

39:50.583 --> 39:54.500
From childhood if you talk of all these things, money orientation,

39:54.792 --> 39:57.375
children also know this and they talk like that.

39:57.709 --> 39:59.500
There are many other things for children,

39:59.792 --> 40:01.083
we should just avoid.

40:01.375 --> 40:04.166
Don't allow them to go near all such things,

40:04.500 --> 40:07.500
which are creating money orientation

40:07.792 --> 40:09.917
because that is the problem of today,

40:10.166 --> 40:14.709
that everywhere you find people who have made money, illegally.

40:14.917 --> 40:16.166
So much money has been made.

40:16.500 --> 40:18.500
And there is no need to do that.

40:18.792 --> 40:22.166
But still, you see, they go, this money orientation is funny thing.

40:22.500 --> 40:25.999
It's a greed, it's a madness, I tell you, real madness.

40:26.291 --> 40:29.083
A person wants to have, say, 25 cars.

40:29.375 --> 40:31.500
Is he going to sit in the 25 cars?

40:31.792 --> 40:34.917
He wants to have 25 aeroplanes.

40:35.083 --> 40:36.166
What is he going to do with that?

40:36.500 --> 40:38.709
For that, he is cheating everyone,

40:38.999 --> 40:41.709
troubling everyone, taking the money of others.

40:41.999 --> 40:44.583
Is better to be poor, than to be like that.

40:44.917 --> 40:47.166
So, this is what is happening today

40:47.500 --> 40:51.417
is that people have gone…the track is wrong.

40:51.709 --> 40:54.917
Is the right side track, right side track.

40:55.208 --> 40:59.083
I should say, we start our Sahaja Yoga from Shri Ganesha,

40:59.417 --> 41:02.083
who is on the left side. Not on the right side.

41:02.291 --> 41:04.709
First, you developed your left side,

41:04.999 --> 41:07.208
then you come to right, you are alright.

41:07.500 --> 41:11.291
That's why we have our Sahaja Yoga completely built in

41:11.500 --> 41:13.083
on Shri Ganesh.

41:14.208 --> 41:17.208
Once he's there, you are completely alright

41:17.500 --> 41:20.500
and no problem. There's no lack of wisdom.

41:20.625 --> 41:23.208
Once you are with Shri Ganesh,

41:23.500 --> 41:27.834
you see the point, absolutely clearly,

41:28.083 --> 41:32.834
how to behave, how to live,

41:33.083 --> 41:37.834
and you don't take to stupid things like lust,

41:38.083 --> 41:39.291
greed and nonsense.

41:39.625 --> 41:41.417
But people are mad, you know,

41:41.625 --> 41:44.999
they take to any kind of thing when they grow up.

41:45.291 --> 41:47.917
But as children, if they have an influence,

41:48.208 --> 41:54.417
very beautiful influence of proper family life,

41:54.709 --> 42:00.834
proper school life, proper guidance,

42:01.083 --> 42:08.083
proper love and help in every way,

42:08.417 --> 42:12.834
in their growth, then children become extremely,

42:13.125 --> 42:15.542
extremely good, beautiful.

42:15.750 --> 42:19.750
And I bless all the Sahaja Yogis to have children

42:20.000 --> 42:25.125
of that nature, and to look after your children.

42:25.417 --> 42:29.750
That's very important, because they are tomorrow's Sahaja Yogis.

42:30.000 --> 42:32.834
And they should be of better quality.

42:33.125 --> 42:38.542
Because you are coming from another lot.

42:43.417 --> 42:46.125
They are coming from the innocence,

42:46.417 --> 42:50.208
so they are very pure,

42:50.542 --> 42:56.000
and their purity must be respected and must be guarded.

42:56.333 --> 43:00.959
Maybe that we'll understand the importance of children

43:01.208 --> 43:05.208
and develop Ganesha qualities in them.

43:05.542 --> 43:07.417
So, thank you very much
