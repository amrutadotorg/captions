﻿Navaratri Puja, Just Surrender
Hampstead, London (UK), 19 October 1980

00:21.365 --> 00:31.230
So you have already heard about the importance of today
in the life of the Goddess.

00:32.748 --> 00:35.516
And that today is Ravana was killed

00:35.576 --> 00:39.399
and that’s how there were celebrations.

00:43.839 --> 00:46.917
It still reflects itself [unsure]

00:50.135 --> 00:52.303
As you know very well

00:52.652 --> 00:58.878
that all the satanic forces
which one had to face one at the time

00:59.378 --> 01:06.635
are all back on the stage
and they are to be defeated.

01:07.992 --> 01:10.933
The greatest problem of modern times is

01:11.572 --> 01:16.622
that these satanic forces
have taken a very subtle form

01:17.809 --> 01:22.134
and they enter into your psyches and into your egos.

01:23.229 --> 01:27.436
And you are the saints, you are the bhaktas,
you are the devotees of the Goddess.

01:29.095 --> 01:34.718
It’s a very delicate situation
when the confusion is there.

01:35.504 --> 01:45.255
When the saints are attacked,
the aggressor can be removed,

01:45.397 --> 01:54.243
but the saint becomes mixed up
or confused with negative forces,

01:54.958 --> 01:58.510
which is very difficult to make him see the light.

02:00.051 --> 02:02.917
And you have seen this situation very well.

02:04.460 --> 02:07.660
And the subtler you grow, the subtler they became.

02:08.381 --> 02:15.923
And they start giving you ideas
which are so negative,

02:16.147 --> 02:18.746
but you cannot see them.

02:22.731 --> 02:28.122
So the problem today is very delicate.

02:30.487 --> 02:35.521
There are no absolute saints
and there are no absolute bad people.

02:35.848 --> 02:37.598
Such a mixture, a confusion,

02:37.691 --> 02:42.123
that is what is Kali Yuga is,
these modern times are.

02:44.897 --> 02:49.626
The only way to get rid of them is to surrender.

02:51.766 --> 02:55.362
That is the only way,
there is no other way around.

02:56.772 --> 02:59.162
Because when you surrender,

02:59.603 --> 03:06.632
the spirits, the negativities,
the satanic forces just disappear

03:07.086 --> 03:09.261
because they are not effective.

03:11.884 --> 03:13.736
They have no business to be there.

03:13.955 --> 03:19.304
They have no interest in a person
who is surrendered to God.

03:20.758 --> 03:22.984
They cannot surrender.

03:24.548 --> 03:27.884
If they surrender, they’ll also become saints.

03:32.100 --> 03:39.034
All the time to think: “What are my catches?
What are my negativities?” Is not going to help you.

03:39.906 --> 03:42.674
Just surrender all these ideas that are coming to you

03:42.776 --> 03:47.434
and you’ll find that all absurd ideas will run away.

03:48.603 --> 03:54.504
This is the easiest way to get rid of your problems,
is just to surrender.

03:55.904 --> 04:10.626
After all, all these horrible people,
all the horrible deities, enemies,

04:11.820 --> 04:24.212
who came forward to fight the Goddess, are there
as long as you nurture them.

04:25.694 --> 04:30.042
As soon as you surrender yourself,

04:30.380 --> 04:34.094
they find you of no
use for themselves

04:34.242 --> 04:37.832
and they go to other half-baked people.

04:41.534 --> 04:45.766
The growth will only come,
when the surrender is complete.

04:50.170 --> 04:53.703
One has to know that the powers are tremendous.

04:56.541 --> 04:59.157
You cannot conceive it as it is said by Markandeya.

04:59.207 --> 05:03.320
You cannot conceive it;
it is beyond your conception.

05:03.855 --> 05:08.718
Outwardly you cannot understand,
you just cannot understand.

05:12.273 --> 05:16.317
Under such circumstances,
the best thing is to surrender yourself.

05:17.175 --> 05:19.669
Now with surrendering, what do you surrender?

05:19.933 --> 05:25.531
What do you surrender?
It’s your ego and your super-ego

05:26.520 --> 05:31.922
and it is completely cleansed and drenched
in the blessing.

05:33.339 --> 05:35.539
Because you cannot give anything,

05:35.923 --> 05:37.915
you have to receive the blessings

05:38.558 --> 05:42.534
and to receive the blessings
you have to just surrender.

05:42.774 --> 05:44.547
It is so simple.

05:44.930 --> 05:50.452
The easiest way to solve all your problems
is to surrender.

05:54.427 --> 05:59.617
Just say: “I surrender”.
For Realized souls this should be their mantra.

06:00.483 --> 06:04.640
And you will be amazed
how all your problems will vanish.

06:06.812 --> 06:10.723
Because not only that the powers are tremendous,

06:13.283 --> 06:15.832
but as you are Realized souls

06:16.707 --> 06:22.169
all the divine Forces, all the divine Deities,

06:23.136 --> 06:25.536
all the Eternal Beings, Chiranjivas,

06:26.107 --> 06:29.216
all the angels and the ganas,

06:29.805 --> 06:32.028
all of them are looking after you.

06:32.684 --> 06:37.439
But they know one thing, those who are surrendered
and those who are not surrendered.

06:39.052 --> 06:41.238
You just surrender the problem,

06:41.923 --> 06:45.751
and you will be surprised that
the answer will come in such a miraculous way.

06:46.104 --> 06:51.933
Just surrender. Do not take any responsibility
upon yourself. Just surrender.

06:53.364 --> 06:58.722
Because how far you can go into the solution?
Up to your rationality.

06:59.376 --> 07:05.029
Beyond that you are your Spirit,
and the Spirit is connected to the Divine.

07:05.755 --> 07:07.818
So best is to surrender

07:08.590 --> 07:15.415
and the whole thing will show such light
and such beauty and such meaning.

07:17.699 --> 07:23.547
In the modern times now the work is not the same way
as it was where it is described,

07:24.020 --> 07:32.336
when the Raudrarupa or that the Chandrarupa
you see there, was there at the back.

07:35.323 --> 07:42.141
It’s a mine work, it’s a Mother,
it’s a simple, loving, compassionate.

07:42.675 --> 07:51.636
For your protection, this rupa is there,
but you do not see it.

07:53.148 --> 07:56.427
You are completely protected, be sure of it.

08:01.370 --> 08:06.635
And all your powers after Realization
of giving Kundalini awakening,

08:06.760 --> 08:12.318
or of curing people, or of talking about
Sahaja Yoga, or spreading it,

08:12.587 --> 08:18.624
any, any kind of thing that you want
is all granted, is all flowing through.

08:22.303 --> 08:24.905
And as you know, that there are many saints, who have said,

08:24.976 --> 08:32.091
that “Why these Sahaja Yogis,
they should be granted this great boon?”

08:32.444 --> 08:36.212
So one can say it’s a whim, all right.

08:39.950 --> 08:41.932
There is one more thing.

08:42.820 --> 08:49.476
I was happy to learn that the great poet of this country,
Blake, had prophesied about Me.

08:49.692 --> 08:55.027
And it is so beautifully done, that He said that
England is going to be the Jerusalem.

08:55.412 --> 08:57.640
This is going to be the pilgrimage.

08:58.257 --> 08:59.937
The venue has shifted.

09:00.860 --> 09:02.741
And then He has very beautifully-

09:02.806 --> 09:07.516
have you got the thing to read?
Oh, haven’t brought it.

09:07.761 --> 09:10.810
But what reading, that He has said that

09:10.882 --> 09:17.118
first the furnace will be burning in Surrey Hills,
where I came first,

09:17.530 --> 09:21.645
and then He has mentioned Lambeth Vale,
where we have got our Ashram,

09:21.789 --> 09:24.927
where the foundations will be laid,
we have laid the foundations.

09:25.259 --> 09:29.035
And that Jerusalem is going to be in England, not in India.

09:31.886 --> 09:35.342
And you are the people
responsible for this Jerusalem.

09:39.219 --> 09:48.540
Today is the day for which
in India everybody is doing Puja.

09:50.027 --> 09:56.617
And all the Sahaja Yogis today,
in every center there is a Puja today.

09:57.842 --> 10:00.422
And they are all thinking of you people.

10:04.288 --> 10:13.820
So you have to receive the supreme bliss today,
the supreme bliss, only by surrender.

10:14.607 --> 10:17.007
Today the vibrations are tremendous.

10:17.298 --> 10:20.309
Keep all your doubts and all your nonsensical things outside.

10:20.850 --> 10:23.308
Just receive it and get it.

10:24.509 --> 10:27.029
These things are going to help you, nothing else.

10:27.281 --> 10:30.336
Because you don’t have to give Me anything,
but receive it yourself.

10:30.675 --> 10:33.029
Receive it as much as you can.

10:42.937 --> 10:52.117
This Havan you know is a very good thing
for reciting the name of the Goddess.

10:52.838 --> 10:56.129
Her eyes are given by fire, [Agni] as they say,

10:57.722 --> 11:05.029
and in that light, in that fire,
in the name of Goddess,

11:05.310 --> 11:07.319
we awaken our Deities within us

11:08.041 --> 11:16.821
and burn away all that is wrong in these particular chakras
which invoke those powers.

11:18.188 --> 11:20.837
So with devotion and understanding you have to do it.

11:20.917 --> 11:25.023
Because you are really privileged people, today,
extremely privileged.

11:25.661 --> 11:30.428
Be proud of that,
and do with that devotion all these things.

11:31.835 --> 11:34.648
Today is a very much better time

11:34.734 --> 11:41.631
because the Dashara and the Navaratri,
both are combined at this time.

11:42.388 --> 11:44.459
And so it has worked out very well.

11:44.704 --> 11:47.118
We should do it with full devotion.

11:47.766 --> 11:56.616
I think very few people can put in the fire,
but we can all do symbolically and say this.

11:56.861 --> 12:00.138
And how many names do you want to take away?

12:01.239 --> 12:03.333
Hundred-and-eight?

12:03.476 --> 12:04.047
Sahaja Yogi: Thousand.

12:04.120 --> 12:05.303
Shri Mataji: “What’s it?

12:05.379 --> 12:07.931
Shri Mataji: You would like to thousand?
That is a good idea.

12:08.035 --> 12:10.349
If you have that much devotion
it will be the best

12:10.414 --> 12:12.744
because it will about take two hours
at the most, at the most.

12:12.865 --> 12:15.480
Not two hours, I think one hour if we go fast.

12:15.983 --> 12:17.560
Will you be able to say all that?

12:17.634 --> 12:18.932
Do you think it’s easy?”

12:19.194 --> 12:20.714
Sahaja Yogi: “Yes.”

12:21.497 --> 12:23.697
Shri Mataji: “One thousand names.

12:24.933 --> 12:27.040
Or else, you can give food to children.

12:27.231 --> 12:28.675
They will be tired.

12:28.807 --> 12:32.502
What do you think?
Let’s try it.

12:35.490 --> 12:37.311
In India they would do one thousand.

12:37.481 --> 12:43.030
Sahaja Yogi: Then we will do thousand.
