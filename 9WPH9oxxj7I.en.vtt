1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
My story is very short, three little stories.

2
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:20.000
The unfortunate thing is that I can never remember the year I went on five India tours in a row, starting with 1989.

3
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:27.000
And I can't remember the place either. But Caroline you might remember because I think you were there at this first one.

4
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:43.000
And we were in a camp, all the ladies in one pental. And one day we suddenly had a message from somebody that there was a snake in the ladies pental, somewhere in the ladies pental there was a snake.

5
00:00:43.000 --> 00:01:01.000
And suddenly there was all this screeching and oh my goodness, you know, everybody, all the women rushed back to the pental where all our belongings were, and we started to unpack all our cases to make sure the snake wasn't in there, empty the sleeping bags,

6
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:13.000
you know, looking in all the sleeping bags and looking under all the clothes and everything and it was like completely frantic, we were all rushing all over this do you remember that Caroline were you there.

7
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
I was there but I don't remember that.

8
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:24.000
I'm sure you were there because I have a feeling it was the same year that your marriage was matched your and Chris's.

9
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And you know, it was the previous marriage Rosalind. Oh,

10
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
yeah, remember that.

11
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Anyway, so we had this frantic afternoon I think he was trying to find if the snake was in our tent, and then to calm down a little bit and that nice of costume as you always used to come and talk to us in the evenings and she started to talk to us and

12
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:59.000
she was smiling and she said, you know, I believe that you've all been worried about the snake in the ladies tent.

13
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
She said I put it there.

14
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Put it there on purpose to test your faith.

15
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.000
And she was kind of smiling and laughing as if we'd all failed that test.

16
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:26.000
And she was testing us to see if we would, I mean actually some of the yoginis were very calm, I think they were in that good state where they felt that, you know, nothing would happen to them.

17
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000
I don't remember being so frantic myself either but I'm sure I didn't pass the test very well.

18
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:48.000
So, and then a lot of the memories I have of India tours this this is another one another year was just spending days and days and days traveling around on the coaches on the buses.

19
00:02:48.000 --> 00:03:02.000
And we traveled one day again I'm sorry I don't remember the year or the place but I do have some diaries there in there in my loft and I need to get them down really and have a look at the years because most of it's written down in my diaries.

20
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:11.000
And we traveled one day for hours and hours and hours I think we stopped somewhere for lunch.

21
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:27.000
And we traveled, and we never, you know, nobody ever seemed to know where we were going. We sometimes said well let's try and find out this as the drivers. And you know in the Indian fashion the drivers just shut their head, you know, we didn't give us an answer.

22
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:43.000
We never knew where we were going. And we just traveled on and on and on that day, and in the evening they just took us to a block of flats, like a concrete block of flats, and we were told by somebody that that's where we were going to sleep that night.

23
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:53.000
And they didn't have anything with us at all we just had our show, you know, I used to go off on the tours we had a show, and a bottle of water and that was it, notice for snow bag, nothing.

24
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
And we just

25
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:11.000
we just lay down in these flats on concrete floors on the shore that's what we had no nothing to rest our heads on. And they said okay you're sleeping here now, I think we must have had something to eat, although I don't remember that.

26
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.000
And that's it we slept there, got up in the morning, we'd had the slept very well of course.

27
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:28.000
I think really, a lot of you will say the same probably there were tests of, you know, our comfort, it was to get over comfort as well wasn't it a lot of it.

28
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:40.000
So we got up in the morning had a little bit of breakfast I think they Indian yogis put some breakfast on for us and then we just traveled back all day to the camp, and that's all we did.

29
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:56.000
We just traveled to this one place, and I don't know to this day, why we were going there what we were doing. I'd love someone to tell us you know what we were doing but I mean, we know now that a lot of that was to vibrate different areas as well,

30
00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:07.000
you know, she was using us using our Kundalini to vibrate different areas and probably other things as well.

31
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:14.000
And to get over the comfort, but we just, we just couldn't find out anything and one year and then by.

32
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:26.000
I took, I thought I must buy a map of India so I can at least follow where we're going and I bought this lovely map and took it with me and then one yogi came up and borrowed it and I never saw it.

33
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
That wasn't much use.

34
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:36.000
And then just one other short story is, we were, I think we were in Hyderabad one year.

35
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:44.000
And it's the same thing again. We were sent off all day somewhere on the coaches.

36
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:58.000
Sometimes we obviously used to go to temples and things didn't we but this particular day in Hyderabad, we didn't go anywhere, and we weren't given any lunch so we were out all day completely all day for hours and hours and hours.

37
00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:06.000
And we didn't get any lunch and we started to get attached to that, you know, very much like well when are we going to eat.

38
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:17.000
And again we got back to the camp at night and Shamata Ji came, that was a very, very powerful evening that was I remember.

39
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
I remember something else about it.

40
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:39.000
Shamata Ji came in the evening, and she said, I'm very sorry that you didn't get any lunch today, I couldn't let you eat in this place because there's a very bad rakshasa that's always lived here, probably born there, and I couldn't let you eat anything in this place.

41
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:47.000
I remember that I've just remembered that night, she particularly remember this she was.

42
00:06:47.000 --> 00:07:06.000
She didn't. At this point in time she wasn't saying very much and she just looked very intensely at each corner of the room that well the hall I mean you know it's a massive hall, and she looked at one corner of the whole really intensely and she didn't say anything.

43
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000
And then she looked at the right hand corner of the hall.

44
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:27.000
I didn't say anything that you look down at the corner down on the left and then corner on the right. And she just literally moved ahead to those different corners and she was definitely destroying something that night, you know, she was.

45
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:33.000
She looked like the goddess that was on in a battle destroying something was very powerful.

46
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:46.000
So, whatever that was, and there's a side yoga I met an Indian yogi who came to England and told me that, you know, we didn't, he wasn't around then he came from Hyderabad.

47
00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:55.000
And he told me that he said oh I must let you know that it's very good there now there's a big collective there and it's whatever it was has been cleared.

48
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
So, that was very powerful.

49
00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:05.000
And that's it really, that's, I have to do a lot of other stories but just keep it short for now.

50
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000
Well it's lovely and Rosanne Thank you very much.

51
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:18.000
And Elizabeth, would you like me to immediately start share that first photograph.

52
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
No, not yet.

53
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:26.000
Okay, first photograph will be towards the end I'll tell you when. Okay.

54
00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:32.000
So, well, unlike some of you.

55
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:40.000
In the 1970s I knew absolutely nothing Sri Mataji inside yoga.

56
00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
So I already left England by then.

57
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000
Believe it or not, Jeremy, are you there.

58
00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:54.000
I wanted to be a teacher since starting school in Coventry at the age of five.

59
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.000
So to get to I say, as soon as I left school.

60
00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:14.000
I opted for a four year degree course in French and Italian at Exeter University that included a year as an English assistant in a lise in Clermont-Ferrand in France.

61
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:29.000
Well, after graduating in 1968 I married a French teacher I'd met while teaching in Clermont and went to live in central France. What had I done there.

62
00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:43.000
The marriage was an absolute disaster immediately, not only that, but I had to wait until 1979. That's 11 years for divorce to be made legal in France.

63
00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
Before I could escape.

64
00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:52.000
And in the meantime I studied to qualify as an English teacher in France.

65
00:09:52.000 --> 00:10:02.000
In 1980, this is where mother started to come to it.

66
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:17.000
In 1980, the French government posted me to the International School in Fermi-Volterra, which is on the French-Swiss border, just outside Geneva.

67
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:25.000
And it was there that I first heard of Sartre yoga in 1985.

68
00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:36.000
So, to cut a long story short, in 1986 and 87 I went on the India tours with the Swiss Sartre yogis.

69
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:45.000
I was rather nervous about going as I'd spent the summer of 1985 in Kashmir and Ladakh.

70
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:51.000
And I developed hepatitis there.

71
00:10:51.000 --> 00:11:05.000
And went on the Hindu pilgrimage to Amarnath on a diet of rice and water, having lost 10 kilos and feeling very very weak.

72
00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:22.000
Whereas the first two tours that I did with Sartre yoga, I survived quite easily, without any such tapasya at all.

73
00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:40.000
In 1988, I went on my third Sartre yoga tour, but it started earlier than in the previous years. I couldn't get time off before the end of term, I couldn't get time off school.

74
00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
And the main group had already left.

75
00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000
But fortunately, I wasn't alone.

76
00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:52.000
Matthias Kaluzny and I flew to Bombay.

77
00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000
And then we took a taxi to Pratistan.

78
00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:00.000
This was before mother's house was built, of course.

79
00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:06.000
The taxi dropped us off with our suitcases not far from the big tent.

80
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000
Strangely enough, there was no one around.

81
00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
It didn't take long to find out why.

82
00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:21.000
We'd arrived in the middle of a pooja and mother was already there.

83
00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:35.000
I dumped my cases outside the pendulum and sneaked into a corner of the back of the pendulum, feeling very conspicuous and uncomfortable.

84
00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
Because I wasn't wearing a sari.

85
00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000
And I wasn't at all fresh after the journey.

86
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:48.000
At the end of the pooja, my mother was giving up presents.

87
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:59.000
I decided to take my suitcase up to the tents to find a place where I could freshen up and change into a sari.

88
00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:06.000
I was about to do so when two yogis appeared.

89
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:13.000
I didn't know either of them. What were they doing there in the ladies' tent?

90
00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:25.000
One of them, who turned out to be Javier Valderrama, the leader in Milan, asked me, are you Elizabeth from Switzerland?

91
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
Yes. Why?

92
00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:35.000
This is your husband, Nicola. What?

93
00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:48.000
It was such a shock. I must have gaped at them, absolutely speechless and incredulous because I hadn't filled in a marriage application.

94
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:58.000
In fact, I was quite allergic to the idea of marrying again after my previous marriage, which had lasted for 10 extremely traumatic years.

95
00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:04.000
And I was bringing up my two children who were now teenagers on my own.

96
00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:11.000
But for some reason I just couldn't react. I couldn't protest.

97
00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:17.000
I just surrendered.

98
00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:22.000
That was no doubt due to the effect of the pooja.

99
00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:28.000
But it was also because nobody had said anything to me beforehand.

100
00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:36.000
As I had arrived during the pooja and hadn't seen or spoken to anybody.

101
00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:46.000
Mother had organised everything in such a way that I just couldn't react.

102
00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:56.000
This was confirmed when Nicola and I did namaska to Shrimataji before the wedding.

103
00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:06.000
Can you put the photo up please Caroline, the first one.

104
00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
That's it.

105
00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:25.000
Mother looked at me with such a sweet, loving smile on her face and said, don't think.

106
00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:30.000
And it was obvious

107
00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:40.000
that everything had been done by the Divine. It was all worked out, it was all arranged.

108
00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:51.000
I had nothing to say, nothing to do, nothing to think about. It was all done for me.

109
00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:57.000
I even learned later that Mother

110
00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:08.000
had been through all the India tour application forms and picked me out.

111
00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:16.000
Even though I hadn't filled in a marriage application.

112
00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:22.000
J Shrimataji, that's my story.

113
00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:27.000
Can you show the last photographs? Has the photograph changed?

114
00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
No.

115
00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:36.000
Yeah, I think I need to think you're rubbing it in.

116
00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000
Then, let me see.

117
00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000
The others are after the wedding.

118
00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:47.000
Well,

119
00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:53.000
there are only three or four, I think.

120
00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000
Yes, that's right.

121
00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000
Nicola and me at the wedding.

122
00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000
Yeah, I'm trying to.

123
00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:09.000
That's not changed has it? Yes, that's changed. What year was that Elizabeth?

124
00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
It was 1988.

125
00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.000
Oh, I thought I recognised that.

126
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:25.000
The 28th of December, my son's birthday, the night wedding day.

127
00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000
1988.

128
00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:35.000
And has it changed again now Elizabeth? Yes. Excellent. That's the last one after the wedding, looking very relaxed, surprising.

129
00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:45.000
photographs, knowing what how it has happened. I, you know, I was really in South Australia.

130
00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000
Thank you. That's wonderful.

131
00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000
Thank you so much Elizabeth.

132
00:17:51.000 --> 00:18:03.000
And, Antoinette.

133
00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:12.000
I'm going to, I don't know if you can start before I need to open the photographs. I don't know if you can start before I do that.

134
00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:25.000
Yeah, okay.

135
00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:31.000
And

136
00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:50.000
do you need the photographs at first Antoinette or? Well, I just wanted to, as I said to you, I wanted to talk a bit about the general atmosphere and the rivers that we were discovering in India, on India tour.

137
00:18:50.000 --> 00:19:11.000
And it was Shrimataji would send us into the river, not only to wash our clothes that we did together, you know, it was very fun, all the ladies washing their salaries there, and then putting them on the on the shore to dry in the sun.

138
00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:28.000
It was great fun but she also said to take the, the, the molasses of the at the bottom of the river, they were very shallow, and also very the water was very soft, very sweet there was no.

139
00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:42.000
It was not hard water at all. And she said to put the, the, the clay, it's clear that's the word I was looking for clay on our faces, because it's very good for the skin.

140
00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:54.000
So I don't have the photo here I don't I don't know where is the photo I had that but we were all having this kind of gray or dark lay on our faces that we looked very funny.

141
00:19:54.000 --> 00:20:12.000
I have a photo of it but unfortunately I didn't find it for that but I mean that's the river. And on another occasion or so I'm going to talk a bit more about a particular river, but she also said to drink the water of the river because it's very good for the Nabi.

142
00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:29.000
So, yes, the river in India are just incredibly beautiful. So I can share now. I think there should be foot soaking along the river. Oh yeah, that's also Yeah, no, that's not the one I want to know that that's a meal on the banana.

143
00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:54.000
Has that changed now. Yeah, that's one. Yeah, yeah. So Bigfoot so I don't remember which relate might be Brahma Puri because I recognize the rocks, but it might be any other kind of Yamuna River or, you know, one of these rivers in Maharashtra didn't put the name behind the photo so I don't know but it was quite the site.

144
00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:14.000
Everybody foot soaking like that. And I have another photo I think I gave you, Caroline of us in the river, bathing and washing the laundry and bathing. Yeah, that's it. Yeah, yeah, that's very sweet. I think it's very Lakshmi kind of photo.

145
00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:24.000
And, yeah, so we did that very often, you know, kind of when we were in India.

146
00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:38.000
And then, yeah, I don't have a photo of the Brahma Puri River, but I have a very beautiful story about the Brahma Puri River, also named the Sri Krishna River.

147
00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:49.000
And I don't know if you might know, I have two diaries that I kind of wrote from 1978 to 1996.

148
00:21:49.000 --> 00:22:15.000
And because she might have asked me to write things down, because later on, people will want to know. So I'm going to read out of my diary This is really accurate, and that was actually 1986, the, the 10 April, 10 April 1986, and I'm going to translate it from French into English.

149
00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:33.000
So I say here, before the trip to India has left unforgettable experiences. There are three in particular, which has marked my return to the Mother India.

150
00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:57.000
So I'm going to talk only about the first one. The first one was Brahma Puri at the banks of the river Krishna, where Shri Mataji had come to baste her feet, surrounded by all the sajaja yogis who came one after the other to get her blessings.

151
00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:13.000
So I was evidently amongst them. In the beginning, Shri Mataji told me, you need to look after your Vishuddhi, your hands are pink.

152
00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:34.000
My attention, the previous days was not that clear. And I was still kind of being worried about things from home. So she asked me to massage her feet in the water.

153
00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:50.000
Then she said to me, better now. And I was feeling the vibrations really clearly. The circle around Shri Mataji was so tight, she was sitting actually on a rock.

154
00:23:50.000 --> 00:24:02.000
And there's a beautiful photo of her there, but unfortunately I don't have that photo. So the circle was so tight that I couldn't actually get out of the river.

155
00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:19.000
So I found a little spot on a stone just at the feet of Shri Mataji, very close to her. And my feet were in the water. It was just two feet away from her.

156
00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:41.000
On the other side, there was my brother, Cregoire. Then Shri Mataji spoke about the right Vishuddhi. She said to my brother and to me to say, mother, I'm not French. And she said that we had to correct this right Vishuddhi.

157
00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:58.000
So then later on, I saw a photo which had been taken about this moment by a Saja Yogi. I think it was Antonio Saracino, actually, one of the Italians.

158
00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:18.000
And you can see a triangle of light coming out of the ankle of Shri Mataji. It's a miraculous photo and it's very beautiful. It's two rays of light coming out of a right Vishuddhi.

159
00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:32.000
And that must have been at that moment. So then a very beautiful event happened at that point.

160
00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:50.000
So there were some Saja Yogis coming through the river to get Shri Mataji's blessing. And I remember there was an Algerian Saja Yogi who was quite new in Saja Yoga.

161
00:25:51.000 --> 00:26:03.000
And when she came close to her in the river, he had a kind of revelation and said, Hala wakba, hala wakba.

162
00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:21.000
So he recognized actually that Shri Mataji was Allah. And it was very moving. He was in the Sri Krishna river, recognizing who Shri Mataji was, identifying Shri Krishna, I mean, Hala to Shri Mataji.

163
00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:39.000
And then there was another Saja Yogi who was Norwegian. He was very tall and he was an executive in one of the UN kind of, how do you say, in the UN.

164
00:26:39.000 --> 00:27:06.000
And he knelt in front of Shri Mataji in the water. He was very tall. And Shri Mataji took some water from the river and put it gently on his head saying, I couldn't baptize you when you were a baby, so I baptize you now. And that was like a biblical moment as well. Very beautiful.

165
00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:25.000
So then I remember we were just completely enchanted by this amazing sceneries. And we started to a chorus in a cappella all around the river. It was beautiful.

166
00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:33.000
We sang first Kundalini Kundalini Shri Mata Mata Mataji. You know this one.

167
00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:48.000
Kundalini Kundalini Shri Mata Mata Mataji. You know this one, I'm sure. And then the other one was,

168
00:27:48.000 --> 00:28:03.000
Mother, how I adore you, all my life I give you, how I love you.

169
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:14.000
And again in chorus, all the Saja Yogis around the river singing and Shri Mataji was silent and the vibrations were tremendous.

170
00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:21.000
I mean, it is an amazing memory. I must say I remember that.

171
00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:41.000
So, yes, here I write, shortly after that this Norwegian Saja Yogi wrote at the end of his diary that it was the end of his earthly trip.

172
00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:51.000
He wanted to leave this earth. He had his realization. I mean, he was an elderly man.

173
00:28:51.000 --> 00:29:09.000
When he came six weeks after his return, upon his return at home, he actually died very passively, very peacefully in his sleep.

174
00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:18.000
So, at Brahmapuri, we have, we drank also the water of the river.

175
00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:27.000
It was, there was clay in the water, but it was so cool and so good. The taste was very nice.

176
00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:35.000
And Shri Mataji said, it won't harm you. It is very good for your Nabi.

177
00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:41.000
So, there we are. So, it was beautiful. That's one event.

178
00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:46.000
Well, I mean, I'm not going to take too much time because...

179
00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.000
But tell me when you want me to show... Sorry?

180
00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.000
Tell me when you want me to change the photograph.

181
00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.000
You have, I mean, you showed me two of the rivers.

182
00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:59.000
Yeah, but I have also the other photographs you sent.

183
00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:05.000
Yeah, maybe you can send, I mean, just to give an atmosphere for those who haven't been at that time.

184
00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:11.000
I mean, someone talked about the buses and I think it would be lovely to see the photo of the buses.

185
00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:15.000
There they are, with all our luggage at the top.

186
00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:24.000
And it was all the men who had to actually lift all the suitcases and put them on the top of the buses.

187
00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:31.000
So, we were asked, the ladies, not to have too heavy luggage, you know, because can you imagine for them.

188
00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:41.000
And like the first Yogini said, we would travel for hours. I remember sometimes 12 hours in the buses.

189
00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:47.000
And sometimes there was so much dust in the road that it was quite difficult.

190
00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:56.000
It was catching our throat and we were putting our sari in front of our mouth.

191
00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:11.000
And then a bus leader said, just put your attention on Sri Mataji and Sri Krishna and think that the dust is actually from Mother Earth, from India, Bumi Devi.

192
00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:16.000
And you will not be irritated by the dust.

193
00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:27.000
And we did. We said the mantra actually. And then it was over. We didn't feel this kind of dusty throat again.

194
00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:32.000
So yeah, that's a memory which just came back in my mind.

195
00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:38.000
Yeah, the buses journey was epic, I must say.

196
00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:48.000
So also, well, I just want to quickly say about the meals. The meals were delicious. And you just showed this picture there.

197
00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:53.000
They were served on banana leaves and they were cooked beside.

198
00:31:53.000 --> 00:32:00.000
And I have another photo that you can show afterwards where the kitchen was with all the tomatoes, etc.

199
00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:10.000
And it was always obviously organic food. And sometimes they even cooked chicken for us because they knew we were not vegetarian.

200
00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:21.000
It was just delicious every time. Always warm food. And I didn't think there was a tapasya there. It was really nice.

201
00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:27.000
But yes, I agree that sometimes we would have our meals at one o'clock in the morning.

202
00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:36.000
So not at kind of scheduled times. It was just when we would come after a program, sometimes very late at night.

203
00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:45.000
But still, we were advised not to go to bed and eat our food because sometimes we didn't know when the next meal would happen.

204
00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:53.000
So it was important to eat at the time we were asked to have our food.

205
00:32:53.000 --> 00:33:05.000
It was all very fast and we need to be... It was a big test on our attention. We just need to be very... We needed to be very collective and have a good attention.

206
00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:13.000
So, yeah, that's just a little glimpse of part of a kitchen with all the cauliflowers and all the tomatoes there, all the vegetables.

207
00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:19.000
So these are all just quick snapshots.

208
00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:25.000
Oh, yeah, somebody talked about the tent and the snake. There you are.

209
00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:33.000
We have a ladies' pandal with all the suitcases that was at the bottom of our feet.

210
00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:41.000
And you see how we were there. Very cozy, but quite a bit squashed sometimes. But no, it was fine.

211
00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:51.000
It was very, very homely, actually. I never had any problems in a tent. It was just really... We had laughter.

212
00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:59.000
So we could have some very nice chats sometimes. But look how they would do at the top.

213
00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:10.000
The roof was all kind of done with maybe old cotton saris. But, yeah, that's our pandal, the ladies' tent.

214
00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:20.000
The other one is... Yeah, that was just to show an Indian wedding very early on. I think it was 1982, this one.

215
00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:27.000
And I was asked to be the mother of the couple there who is Deepak and Amrata.

216
00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:33.000
And I was so honoured. This is me with a white sari and with red flower on it.

217
00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:39.000
And I took it so seriously, so at heart. And Shrimataji was very happy.

218
00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:46.000
That was actually my first ever tour in India so early on. I think 1982 or 1983.

219
00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:54.000
And I was just awed by this beautiful ceremony of these Indian weddings.

220
00:34:54.000 --> 00:35:02.000
So, yeah. Now, oh, yeah, there's another photo of me. Oh, no, that's...

221
00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:05.000
Do you want me to show the photo of you?

222
00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:08.000
Yeah, yeah, that's me. Oh, yeah. Sorry, hang on.

223
00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:11.000
No, no, you were OK. I just wanted to show... That was before the wedding.

224
00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:16.000
Yeah, that's me and Ellora, so looking quite young at that time.

225
00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:23.000
And then there was another photo of all of us before our weddings, our sahaj weddings.

226
00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:26.000
Would that be the talk to the yogis, this one?

227
00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:31.000
Yeah, talk to the yogis, exactly there. So we have quite a few here.

228
00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:37.000
And Shrimataji is talking to all the future married couples there.

229
00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:44.000
I recognize quite a few and I'm just there in yellow, in the yellow saree there.

230
00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:52.000
So, yeah, that's it for the photos. I would just like... I mean, is that... I mean, I think...

231
00:35:52.000 --> 00:36:04.000
I personally feel if Maria Amelia doesn't mind, that we'll finish on your stories today, Antoinette, and just save all of Maria Amelia's for next time.

232
00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:10.000
It seems a little shame to cut short you and also to give Maria Amelia very little time to talk today.

233
00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:18.000
Yeah, well, I have only one more story, if you want, about music, you know, which was...

234
00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:24.000
I mean, obviously I could talk the whole night about India. I have so many stories.

235
00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:28.000
And let me just... can I just check? Is that OK with you, Maria Amelia?

236
00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:35.000
Of course it is, of course. I'm recognizing these pictures as well.

237
00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:43.000
Yeah, of course, we were always there. So it's about Radhakrishna Temple.

238
00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:52.000
It was a music evening with some local bhajan singers. It was so beautiful.

239
00:36:52.000 --> 00:37:02.000
So that was the 4th of February, 1984. I wrote the same evening program, bhajan of Shri Mataji.

240
00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:09.000
Shri Mataji was surreal of beauty in a white sari with a pink border.

241
00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:20.000
We were all sitting down on the all kind of very comfortable white, thin mattresses.

242
00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:30.000
And the singers were all in a kurta with their little hat. I don't know how it is called, the hat they had.

243
00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:43.000
And they had an amazing rhythm and an intensity and a unity which was absolutely breathtaking.

244
00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:58.000
And they were singing the sacred poetry of the good deeds of the saint called Makandeya.

245
00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:11.000
The praise of the good deeds and the... how do you say? The praise of the sacred poetry.

246
00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:18.000
Yeah, the praises of self-realization of the saints of Maharashtra.

247
00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:22.000
And it was not actually one, it was about Machindranath.

248
00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:35.000
And at the end of their singing, they actually recognized Shri Mataji for who she was.

249
00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:41.000
And identified their singing because they were singing to God.

250
00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:48.000
And then they recognized that actually Shri Mataji was God, which was extremely moving.

251
00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:55.000
And they all were kind of going at her feet, bowing down to her.

252
00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:00.000
And for us it was profoundly moving.

253
00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:08.000
Shri Mataji had an expression of deep joy.

254
00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:13.000
And she left us, blessing us all.

255
00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:25.000
And the saris on which she had sat down and had put her feet had such strong vibrations.

256
00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.000
We were covered in vibrations.

257
00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:35.000
And then the fragrance of the Indian garland were filling the night.

258
00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:40.000
And we were completely drenched in that perfume.

259
00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:43.000
I write here,

260
00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:45.000
Le tou et est dans mon differant.

261
00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:50.000
The whole was from another world and shanti, shanti, shanti.

262
00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:53.000
So yeah, that was a beautiful experience.

263
00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:59.000
Okay, I can end here. I mean, I have all other ones, but we'll have other occasions.

264
00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:05.000
Yes, but Antoinette, would you like to just share one more story before you finish?

265
00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:12.000
Okay, yeah, I have a nice story, which is not out of my diary because I know it's completely by heart.

266
00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:21.000
That was at the concert with young children, teenagers actually from 12 to 16.

267
00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:31.000
And I still remember it was a very sunny day and we were all in a white pendal, a small pendal.

268
00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:41.000
And there was an orchestra of kind of teenager from like 13 to 16 or 17 who were not singing,

269
00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:46.000
but they were all playing different instruments without a paper, just like that.

270
00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:53.000
I was absolutely amazed. And I'll head the task. She matters. She had orchestrated that completely.

271
00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:57.000
I had the task to hold her bag and sit next to her.

272
00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:01.000
So I had her back on my lap and I was next to her.

273
00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:13.000
And at some point in my heart, I've said I was elated by the music and the complete unity of this young orchestra.

274
00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:26.000
And I prayed in my heart and I said, wouldn't it be beautiful to have children who give so much beautiful music and joy to the world?

275
00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:39.000
And yeah, I was like in meditation. At that point, she turned to me and asked me to give her her purse.

276
00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:42.000
So I gave her her purse, opened the bag, gave her her purse.

277
00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:54.000
And she gives me some Indian money to go and distribute to the children out there because that's the way they do also with kawali.

278
00:41:54.000 --> 00:42:02.000
So I was completely elated to have to do that. And I took this money and I gave to the children their art.

279
00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:08.000
And then I went and sat down next to Shrimataji again and I namaskar to her with a big smile.

280
00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:15.000
And she smiled back at me. And lo and behold, three years later, I had my three girls.

281
00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:21.000
They were born very close together, the twins just one year after Mahadevi.

282
00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:30.000
And they are all very musical, have beautiful voice and sing to delight the world.

283
00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:37.000
So that's it. That's beautiful. It's wonderful.

284
00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:43.000
Yeah, it's a beautiful memory, this one. Okay, thank you. I leave it there.

285
00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:48.000
Well, thank you. I'm just going to stop the recording. I hope.

286
00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:52.000
I'll stop sharing and then I shall stop.
