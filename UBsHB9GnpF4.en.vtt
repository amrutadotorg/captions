00:00.001 --> 00:02.486
Easter Puja, Hounslow, UK - 1985-0408

00:02.687 --> 00:06.805
Happy Easter to you all.

00:08.305 --> 00:13.815
So we celebrate Easter

00:14.016 --> 00:19.729
to show how Christ resurrected, resurrected Himself.

00:20.505 --> 00:27.243
The spirit that is Christ has to resurrect

00:27.443 --> 00:40.441
out of the material manifestation of the divine itself.

00:40.642 --> 00:48.575
The matter is manifested,

00:48.775 --> 00:58.449
because we ourselves have created it.

00:58.649 --> 01:07.421
Not that we are born out of matter, our body,

01:07.621 --> 01:13.941
but we are attached to it, we want it, we want to have it.

01:15.262 --> 01:23.816
Whatever you want, that sustains itself by your desire,

01:24.016 --> 01:28.326
because now you are on the stage.

01:28.526 --> 01:32.412
If you want to sustain the matter,

01:32.612 --> 01:38.462
if you want to keep the matter as the first priority,

01:38.662 --> 01:42.881
it will remain.

01:43.631 --> 01:46.887
It cannot disappear.

01:47.087 --> 01:51.066
It has to go out of your mind,

01:51.266 --> 01:55.808
that matter cannot hold you any further.

01:56.008 --> 02:02.483
Christ rose out of the matter, came out
of the tomb which symbolises the matter

02:02.683 --> 02:07.686
which has enclosed us within,

02:07.886 --> 02:13.033
which has to be opened out with our spiritual power.

02:13.233 --> 02:17.561
Throw away, throw away the stone that is covering this grave.

02:17.762 --> 02:27.353
Get out of that and stand outside it.

02:28.853 --> 02:32.803
This is the message of Christ’s resurrection.

02:33.004 --> 02:39.773
The tomb that we have created, we have created ourselves,

02:39.974 --> 02:48.392
because we have allowed people to dominate us.

02:49.642 --> 02:57.031
We have allowed them to make these graves for us,

02:57.231 --> 03:05.479
we have allowed them to bury Christ within ourselves,

03:05.679 --> 03:10.718
because we were afraid.

03:14.292 --> 03:19.972
But Christ has to rise.

03:20.542 --> 03:25.290
So we create our own matter through our conditionings,

03:25.490 --> 03:31.275
through our fears, through our absolute wrong ideas

03:31.475 --> 03:37.259
about goodness and kindness and compassion.

03:38.266 --> 03:42.395
In the light of the Spirit, you can see what we think as compassion

03:42.595 --> 03:52.730
is nothing but a kind of sympathy which leads you nowhere.

03:56.499 --> 04:00.338
But one should learn to see everything in the light of the Spirit.

04:00.538 --> 04:06.178
But do we use all the time the light of the Spirit? We do not.

04:06.378 --> 04:13.221
For Christ, it was not difficult, because He was the Spirit.

04:13.646 --> 04:17.298
But He has shown you the way.

04:17.498 --> 04:22.938
He crucified Himself to show you the way.

04:23.138 --> 04:29.746
All the ideas about sophistication,

04:29.946 --> 04:36.679
about our standing in the society,

04:36.879 --> 04:43.776
how we relate ourselves to other dignitaries or to our country,

04:43.976 --> 04:51.330
to our politics, to our economics and the world at large,

04:51.530 --> 04:57.416
all of them can tie us down to that tomb.

04:58.213 --> 05:02.396
You belong to another category, I’ve told you a hundred times.

05:02.596 --> 05:07.336
And a category which is the Spirit,

05:07.536 --> 05:14.964
which can rise above all the tombs, can throw away everything.

05:15.164 --> 05:18.487
This way you are conditioned.

05:18.687 --> 05:21.737
All absurd ideas have been accepted,

05:21.937 --> 05:28.409
which you cannot explain why you were conditioned like this.

05:30.789 --> 05:35.334
Why I talk more of conditioning? Because of England.

05:35.534 --> 05:38.164
English are very much conditioned people.

05:38.365 --> 05:40.664
The others are Americans who are abandoned.

05:40.899 --> 05:43.002
I mean, you cannot talk to them about anything

05:43.203 --> 05:47.079
because they cannot be rooted into anything.

05:47.279 --> 05:49.665
But the English are too much conditioned people,

05:49.865 --> 05:56.259
and when they are too much conditioned, they build their own tombs.

05:58.524 --> 06:01.731
All these ideas are to be seen

06:01.931 --> 06:06.957
with a new dimension of awareness that you have.

06:07.157 --> 06:11.969
You are the Spirit.

06:14.544 --> 06:18.427
Why should you worry about anything else

06:18.628 --> 06:21.581
but your vibrations?

06:21.782 --> 06:23.778
Because you are saints.

06:23.978 --> 06:29.101
You should just worry about the comfort of your Spirit.

06:29.301 --> 06:34.155
Whatever is congenial to your Spirit, just go on doing that,

06:34.355 --> 06:39.291
observing that, accumulating that and sucking within yourself.

06:39.491 --> 06:41.522
All conditionings will run away.

06:41.723 --> 06:43.723
Because these conditionings you accept,

06:43.924 --> 06:49.965
because they look comfortable, they look comfortable, but they are not.

06:54.345 --> 06:58.336
Christ is a great example and if He is the one whom you follow,

06:58.536 --> 07:02.242
if He is the one you have understood and recognised

07:02.442 --> 07:04.828
in the light of your Spirit,

07:05.028 --> 07:09.237
then you must know why did He go into the grave first of all.

07:09.437 --> 07:11.768
The Man who was so powerful,

07:11.968 --> 07:18.553
Who when He will come He’ll reduce all of them into ashes,

07:18.753 --> 07:22.131
such a great personality like Him of Ekadasha Rudra.

07:22.331 --> 07:26.436
Why did Christ

07:26.636 --> 07:31.415
allow Himself to be crucified and to be buried into that?

07:31.615 --> 07:38.384
Because He wanted to stoop down to the level of other people,

07:38.584 --> 07:41.473
to come down to that level so that people should see that

07:41.673 --> 07:47.957
through His life, they are shown that you can be resurrected.

07:48.157 --> 07:51.328
Now the Resurrection has taken place.

07:51.528 --> 07:58.052
Sahaja Yogis are resurrected no doubt, but still one foot is in the grave.

08:01.383 --> 08:04.542
And the second one I do not know whether it will be out or in,

08:04.742 --> 08:09.171
it is just halfway through.

08:10.751 --> 08:17.176
One foot is of course outside, no doubt,
but still is not yet touching the ground,

08:17.376 --> 08:20.520
and the other cannot be lifted unless you push the ground,

08:20.720 --> 08:26.730
this matter, again, to push it up.

08:28.644 --> 08:32.373
If you live with your Spirit, you should have no fears,

08:32.574 --> 08:34.893
you should have no worry.

08:35.093 --> 08:40.458
See now, I will tell you how God is showing His ways, here.

08:40.658 --> 08:47.700
Like in Durham, the fellow is now under complete fire,

08:47.900 --> 08:52.274
he does not know what to do and he himself is so stupid,

08:52.475 --> 08:56.774
as Sanskrit saying in is that "Vinash Kale Viprita
Buddhi." "When your destruction time comes,

08:56.974 --> 09:01.030
you think of all perverted things", vipareet Buddhi.

09:01.230 --> 09:07.312
So his tongue if you, I mean see to
the way he speaks, I mean, blasphemous.

09:07.512 --> 09:11.041
And he is under fire; he himself lit the fire

09:11.241 --> 09:14.760
and is now sitting on top of it. And now when he gets the heat,

09:14.960 --> 09:19.760
the heated words come out of his mouth.

09:19.960 --> 09:22.911
We don’t have to do anything; it is all done, already.

09:23.111 --> 09:29.033
They are baked and cooked in their own...

09:34.490 --> 09:38.587
So why should we have fear?

09:38.787 --> 09:44.204
But we should know what is right and what is wrong.

09:44.922 --> 09:48.317
That is only possible because you are with the Absolute

09:48.517 --> 09:51.898
that is the Spirit. And related to the Absolute,

09:52.098 --> 09:55.437
if you do everything related to it, you are doing the right thing.

09:55.637 --> 09:58.968
If you are related to Christ, how can you do wrong?

09:59.168 --> 10:03.619
That is one of the proofs that they are not Christians of any kind,

10:03.819 --> 10:08.299
because none of the Christian organisations have done anything good,

10:08.499 --> 10:16.190
whatsoever, except for creating fire for themselves.

10:17.416 --> 10:20.803
So you can see clearly how this conditioning

10:21.004 --> 10:26.440
has worked within us, because
we have been so-called Christians,

10:26.640 --> 10:30.595
we have been going to churches, we have been worshipping Christ as they told us,

10:30.796 --> 10:38.430
the way they told us we worshipped
Him, everything regimented.

10:42.222 --> 10:48.116
The One who came to resurrect us from the bondage of the grave,

10:48.316 --> 10:53.639
we used Him to build our graves.

10:55.959 --> 11:04.518
Now you are out of it, thank God, but take out the other foot, fast.

11:06.885 --> 11:11.446
This is one advantage you have because you have Christ before you,

11:11.646 --> 11:17.397
but also there is a disadvantage because Christ has been used

11:17.598 --> 11:21.269
to set you down in the grave.

11:21.470 --> 11:24.076
So change your concept about Christ,

11:24.277 --> 11:28.988
know Him through your vibrations, what He was.

11:29.188 --> 11:33.597
I mean, as a child I knew what was going wrong with Christians

11:33.797 --> 11:36.284
and left and right, little girl like Me about seven years,

11:36.484 --> 11:39.847
I used to give big lectures.

11:40.047 --> 11:43.081
Even when I was baptised, I was horrified.

11:43.281 --> 11:48.828
The way I was baptised by some stupid fellow.

11:51.605 --> 11:53.605
I did not know what was he up to.

11:53.806 --> 11:56.608
And then he put a bhoot on my head, I think,

11:56.808 --> 12:00.667
or something which hovered round and we met with a very big accident,

12:00.868 --> 12:03.382
I fell down.

12:03.582 --> 12:08.148
This bhoot must have put it in the horse, I feel, or somewhere,

12:08.348 --> 12:10.359
another bhoot.

12:10.559 --> 12:14.570
This priest, the stupid fellow, he belonged to the Lutheran Church.

12:14.770 --> 12:17.200
I don’t know what you call that. Lutheran, imagine,

12:17.400 --> 12:20.815
Martin Luther’s Church.

12:21.015 --> 12:23.729
And that is how they baptised me.

12:23.929 --> 12:31.548
I knew all about it, but I did not know what
to do. I must have kicked him quite a lot.

12:35.158 --> 12:39.889
But whatever it is, so-called, he baptised me.

12:40.090 --> 12:43.750
I had to accept all foolish stupid things in this life,

12:43.950 --> 12:46.578
because I had to show I was quite normal.

12:46.778 --> 12:53.726
I mean, being accepting stupid is normal these days.

12:53.926 --> 12:57.699
And to tolerate an idiot is even more normal.

12:57.900 --> 13:02.734
So I had to show that. I knew very well what sort of a thing it was,

13:02.934 --> 13:13.761
this fellow was up to, and I accepted the nonsense he did

13:13.961 --> 13:21.568
and many other things I accepted just
to show that I am nothing special.

13:21.768 --> 13:26.541
But I knew all about it.

13:26.741 --> 13:30.983
When I saw the way Christ was described, I was aghast.

13:31.183 --> 13:33.952
I said "what are they doing to Christ?".

13:34.152 --> 13:40.999
I mean, nicely second crucifixion going on.

13:42.022 --> 13:46.843
You also know about it.

13:47.970 --> 13:51.450
Thank God there are so many to whom I can talk

13:51.650 --> 13:57.220
and they understand my language.

13:57.801 --> 14:00.586
But the Resurrection will not be complete unless and until

14:00.786 --> 14:05.414
you pull out many out of their graves.

14:05.614 --> 14:07.831
I don’t know how you will go about it.

14:08.031 --> 14:11.409
Look at this fellow Durham gets such a publicity

14:11.609 --> 14:13.616
when he is doing all blasphemous things.

14:13.817 --> 14:18.321
He is getting all the credit and kudos from people. What about us?

14:18.522 --> 14:23.398
What are we doing?

14:23.599 --> 14:28.144
Why not we write to the newspapers? Why not we talk to them?

14:28.344 --> 14:31.382
"Observer" has given us a clue, I think. There is one gentleman,

14:31.582 --> 14:33.753
Mr. Wilson, who wrote quite nice things.

14:33.953 --> 14:36.690
Why not write to him some letters?

14:36.890 --> 14:41.000
Get to it.

14:47.389 --> 14:56.746
Because, you see, what I am a little concerned about this matter is,

14:56.946 --> 14:59.951
as it is they are half-hearted creatures.

15:00.152 --> 15:02.215
Now, if this Durham fellow speaks like that,

15:02.415 --> 15:05.064
who is now the big authority on Christianity, Christ,

15:05.264 --> 15:09.722
His Mother and every body else, Mr. Durham.

15:09.922 --> 15:12.332
And now this fellow if he goes on like this,

15:12.532 --> 15:17.418
those who are half-baked will fall off to Communism,

15:17.618 --> 15:22.006
and the rest of them who may remain also,

15:22.206 --> 15:26.253
they may accept him.

15:27.363 --> 15:35.077
So the Anglicans, the Anglo-Saxon brain, I am saying,

15:35.277 --> 15:39.640
is going to accept Mr. Durham very well, I can see that.

15:39.840 --> 15:43.427
Or else will just leave and become communists.

15:43.627 --> 15:50.302
Have nothing to do with this God who has so many problems.

15:52.958 --> 15:56.141
So in the Seminar of yours in Birmingham when you have,

15:56.341 --> 15:59.406
I would like you to think over this new thing

15:59.606 --> 16:04.219
that has come up in the heart of the Universe.

16:04.419 --> 16:06.718
Everyone knows about Durham fellow,

16:06.918 --> 16:09.554
they know he is blight, everything.

16:09.754 --> 16:13.351
But what about us? We are so many, let us try to find out

16:13.551 --> 16:17.644
how we can talk to these people sensibly,

16:17.845 --> 16:21.987
talk to these Anglicans, find out about them,

16:22.187 --> 16:26.466
and communicate to them what you have found out.

16:26.666 --> 16:29.411
You need not say in the beginning only that I am the Adi Shakti

16:29.611 --> 16:36.098
or I am the Redeemer and the Comforter, that Christ has said.

16:36.841 --> 16:40.560
But we can start talking about it. Find out these people,

16:40.760 --> 16:45.034
these Anglicans, church people, churchgoers who believe in God,

16:45.234 --> 16:49.851
who believe in Christ.

16:52.437 --> 16:55.662
I mean they are voting. Can you imagine?

16:55.862 --> 17:02.471
They are voting whether Christ was true or not. Can you vote like that?

17:04.823 --> 17:09.938
You feel you are in a lunatic asylum or what? It is terrible!

17:10.138 --> 17:16.900
They are taking votes, can you imagine such a thing like that?

17:19.336 --> 17:21.949
At this moment we have an advantage,

17:22.149 --> 17:24.560
because they are so much confused, to give them a concrete idea

17:24.760 --> 17:30.639
as to what is God, what is Christ, what is religion.

17:30.839 --> 17:34.467
One side I feel very hurt and unhappy, I think,

17:34.667 --> 17:39.345
these three days l have gone through real Resurrection myself.

17:39.545 --> 17:44.633
The way things have been about Christ,

17:44.834 --> 17:50.443
just I can’t bear it, I mean, it is too much.

17:51.436 --> 17:56.658
You all should be stirred also, should be concerned.

17:56.858 --> 18:02.840
And you must go through it and see what you can do and tell them:

18:03.040 --> 18:08.593
"Are you all mad or what? Why don’t you listen to sanity?"

18:08.793 --> 18:13.174
As you know, when I went to Australia,

18:13.374 --> 18:15.468
it is a different country altogether.

18:15.669 --> 18:20.605
They are much more sensible people than you are.

18:20.805 --> 18:22.824
I think the way they were exiled,

18:23.024 --> 18:25.363
they learnt a lesson and they are better.

18:25.563 --> 18:30.160
So I feel the English have to go into exile

18:30.360 --> 18:36.527
or jail for a while to understand, deserve it.

18:36.727 --> 18:39.718
They are very sensible, extremely sensible people.

18:39.918 --> 18:44.053
You can talk to them, sense. Everyone.

18:44.254 --> 18:47.343
The media is sensible, the people are sensible.

18:47.543 --> 18:50.487
Thousands of them came. They repeated.

18:50.687 --> 18:56.135
First programme we had once, it was 1 600, 2000.

18:56.335 --> 19:02.806
Can you imagine such people? And out of them repeats were 600.

19:03.006 --> 19:06.318
Now for the last how many years, we are having the same 600 people

19:06.519 --> 19:09.278
again and again? What Seminars are we going to do?

19:09.478 --> 19:15.223
All of us sitting and cooking some chicken, that’s all.

19:18.218 --> 19:24.643
Or making some cake for Mother which She doesn’t eat.

19:24.843 --> 19:32.611
Let us take out our satisfactions from these
little, little things into some thing bigger.

19:33.299 --> 19:39.603
Let us talk about it, without fear.

19:40.893 --> 19:43.925
We have to go and talk and tell people about it.

19:44.125 --> 19:49.074
Take it a big way.

19:49.274 --> 19:52.675
There should be no hindrance on this part.

19:52.876 --> 19:55.120
We are a very big group and we can assert

19:55.320 --> 20:00.605
and we can talk and meet people.

20:05.397 --> 20:09.330
The situation has improved a lot,

20:09.530 --> 20:16.794
because now I have to go to India as you know,

20:16.994 --> 20:24.148
and in India, for me, the situation is much better.

20:24.348 --> 20:26.836
It is not at all difficult.

20:27.036 --> 20:34.651
As you know, I went to the hills at the foothill of Himalayas.

20:34.851 --> 20:37.073
About 3000 people came from all over,

20:37.273 --> 20:41.847
the little, little villages that they had.

20:42.047 --> 20:44.349
They didn’t take even a second to recognise me,

20:44.549 --> 20:49.199
they were singing the praise of the Goddess of the Hills,

20:49.399 --> 20:53.390
Goddess of the Tigers, Goddess of the Lions.

20:53.590 --> 20:57.273
They just started singing my praise.

20:57.473 --> 21:00.617
Without any lecture or anything. They were all joyous

21:00.817 --> 21:04.131
that I have been there and they knew and they accepted Me and finished.

21:04.332 --> 21:09.093
And I just had to put my foot
down there and I have done.

21:09.293 --> 21:16.864
Jaipur, they said, "Mother you just put your foot here", really!

21:17.858 --> 21:20.956
So for me the situation is very good in India.

21:21.157 --> 21:24.064
Now let’s see what you people are going to do

21:24.264 --> 21:28.443
with these big big Seminars and lectures.

21:28.643 --> 21:32.896
Why not get some outsiders to listen to you?

21:33.096 --> 21:36.544
Invite them.

21:36.744 --> 21:42.763
Invite these intellectuals.

21:44.239 --> 21:49.690
Try to talk to them, tell them what is it.

21:49.890 --> 21:54.433
What do you call them, those who know about Bible?

21:54.633 --> 21:58.273
Theologics.

21:58.474 --> 22:04.618
Theologics, theo - what logians? Without logics!

22:04.818 --> 22:06.516
Theologics.

22:06.716 --> 22:11.523
Call these Theologians, challenge them.

22:11.723 --> 22:16.996
Why not put a challenge?

22:18.413 --> 22:23.866
You are not alone, you are so many.

22:25.280 --> 22:31.872
And don’t tell them that you wear saris when you come for my Puja.

22:32.072 --> 22:37.646
They won’t understand it, they are not that deep.

22:37.846 --> 22:42.696
You can wear your jeans.

22:42.897 --> 22:48.775
Or to convince them more, you can be punks.

22:50.043 --> 22:55.363
That would appeal to them better. You go with your punky conditions,

22:55.564 --> 23:02.062
they will jolly well have to listen to you, otherwise they are in for trouble.

23:05.156 --> 23:07.779
If they are that stupid, why not handle them?

23:07.979 --> 23:12.313
It is very easy to handle a stupid person than to handle a person

23:12.513 --> 23:16.329
who is not stupid, or who is clever.

23:16.529 --> 23:23.672
Stupid can be stupefied very easily.

23:26.501 --> 23:28.880
So I think we have to change our course, we have to take it

23:29.080 --> 23:32.816
in a big way, the whole thing, what we are going to do.

23:33.016 --> 23:35.425
All of you should give some concrete ideas

23:35.625 --> 23:40.128
as to what you would like to do.

23:40.328 --> 23:44.184
And that would be really the way it will work out.

23:44.384 --> 23:47.302
So now in the Seminar you must discuss more

23:47.502 --> 23:53.133
how to talk to these people,

23:53.333 --> 23:58.063
how to create a platform for Sahaja Yoga.

23:58.263 --> 24:06.037
Find out how do they create a platform out of nothing, like these punks.

24:08.093 --> 24:11.245
And once you do all these things,

24:11.445 --> 24:18.544
you will be surprised that they will have to listen.

24:18.744 --> 24:21.412
They will have to listen to you.

24:21.612 --> 24:26.240
Now go full ahead. I am giving you all freedom, do what you want.

24:26.440 --> 24:29.275
Except for telling them I am Adi Shakti,

24:29.475 --> 24:31.490
that they will not be able to digest,

24:31.691 --> 24:34.837
that an Indian has now become the Adi Shakti.

24:35.037 --> 24:40.824
They think now Adi Shakti has to be an English lady.

24:41.025 --> 24:45.908
At least, French.

24:54.691 --> 24:57.952
So don’t mention me. If you want you can,

24:58.152 --> 25:01.116
but don’t mention me as Guru or anything, but you should say:

25:01.316 --> 25:04.458
"She is the lady who has shown us the way" or something like that,

25:04.658 --> 25:08.591
not referring much to me, but to them.

25:08.791 --> 25:11.435
I think you should go ahead with it and work it out,

25:11.635 --> 25:13.867
because we have now had a lot of patience,

25:14.067 --> 25:17.263
now all nonsense going around us, better tell them.

25:17.463 --> 25:22.695
Or are we going to allow all of them to go to hell direct?

25:22.895 --> 25:28.092
Message of Easter. East, comes from East.

25:28.292 --> 25:31.305
I don’t know why they call it Easter.

25:31.505 --> 25:35.049
Have you ever thought of it?

25:35.249 --> 25:39.057
Why do they call it a Worcester Sauce, I don’t know.

25:39.257 --> 25:41.322
I don’t know why they call anything anything.

25:41.522 --> 25:47.841
But Easter,

25:48.041 --> 25:50.653
you can’t explain, you know.

25:50.853 --> 25:54.497
Like "curved screen", you don't know.

25:54.697 --> 26:00.874
So I don't know, but Easter, it is coming from the East.

26:01.538 --> 26:07.416
The wisdom has to come from the East, the
Resurrection has to come from the East,

26:07.616 --> 26:11.767
whether they like it or not.

26:13.306 --> 26:16.497
And that is the message of Easter today:

26:16.697 --> 26:21.422
that let us give them the chance of resurrection

26:21.622 --> 26:24.883
by talking to them, all of you.

26:25.083 --> 26:27.080
Should make it a point, go and talk to people

26:27.281 --> 26:30.846
who are in charge of theology, churches, Bibles.

26:31.046 --> 26:34.546
Go and talk to them, tell them:"What are you doing? Are you mad?

26:34.747 --> 26:37.994
Why you want to die? Why do you want to be sleep people.

26:38.194 --> 26:43.293
You don’t know anything."

26:44.628 --> 26:48.218
Another thing I would suggest that we should have regular classes,

26:48.418 --> 26:50.921
to understand Sahaja Yoga properly.

26:51.121 --> 26:54.066
I have seen some people who are Sahaja Yogis for years

26:54.266 --> 27:00.808
don’t know anything about Sahaja Yoga.

27:01.008 --> 27:03.402
Even in Bombay, people told that:

27:03.602 --> 27:07.593
"Some of the ladies are absolutely zero as far as Sahaja Yoga is concerned.

27:07.793 --> 27:09.808
They don’t understand what is Sahaja Yoga is,

27:10.009 --> 27:14.520
they don’t understand what is - what are the chakras are.

27:14.720 --> 27:17.169
They listen to your lecture, everything, and then like a bubble,

27:17.369 --> 27:19.638
the whole thing disappears from their minds."

27:19.838 --> 27:22.770
I don’t know who gave them these ideas, but they were quite shocked.

27:22.970 --> 27:26.114
So let us have a class-like thing for Sahaja Yogis

27:26.314 --> 27:30.812
to different topics and subjects, let us work it out.

27:31.012 --> 27:35.406
Recently you must be knowing, there is a book going to be published by

27:35.606 --> 27:39.480
Yogi Mahajan called ‘Gita Enlightened’ which is a very good book.

27:39.680 --> 27:43.736
Of course, I mean, most of it, I have helped him, he has been with me and all that,

27:43.937 --> 27:47.517
but doesn’t matter, but he has understood
the subject. The other day they published

27:47.718 --> 27:51.101
a very beautiful book in Marathi.

27:51.301 --> 27:54.780
One Suravkar, such a learned book he wrote

27:54.980 --> 27:59.624
that in the light of Gyaneshwara, what is Sahaja Yoga.

27:59.824 --> 28:05.102
And he has written it so well that anybody who is a theologian

28:05.303 --> 28:09.603
or anything, like in India, will be impressed by it.

28:09.803 --> 28:12.439
I wish I could translate that book for you.

28:12.639 --> 28:18.320
But it is all the stanzas from Gyaneshwara,

28:18.520 --> 28:23.059
which is in Marathi language. He
wrote such a nice book on Sahaja Yoga

28:23.259 --> 28:26.499
and that is what he gave on my birthday this time,

28:26.699 --> 28:31.788
something so substantial, I felt.

28:31.988 --> 28:35.369
And once it reaches into the hands of any one of these people,

28:35.569 --> 28:41.015
I mean, it will in any case.

28:41.960 --> 28:45.396
And he published himself, he brought some copies, gave it to me.

28:45.596 --> 28:48.232
And all the copies were sold out in that programme,

28:48.432 --> 28:53.486
every copy was sold out for Rs. 2 each.

28:55.114 --> 28:58.352
So this is what we have to do now, is to write,

28:58.552 --> 29:00.992
write to different magazines, meet people,

29:01.192 --> 29:03.266
tell them we want to come and talk to you.

29:03.466 --> 29:05.875
First of all you must know about Sahaja Yoga.

29:06.075 --> 29:08.075
You should be well equipped.

29:08.276 --> 29:12.164
It’s not that you can show my photograph with a light here.

29:12.364 --> 29:17.995
That is not sufficient. What is the light here, also you have to show.

29:18.195 --> 29:20.429
Only a few people know what is Sahaja Yoga,

29:20.630 --> 29:23.893
the rest of you don't know anything.

29:24.093 --> 29:27.294
Let us see what questions we have in our minds.

29:27.494 --> 29:32.810
Let us sit down and find out: "What are the questions?"

29:33.010 --> 29:35.083
"What questions are we lacking in?"

29:35.284 --> 29:38.258
"What we have to understand in Sahaja Yoga? What part we don’t know?"

29:38.458 --> 29:42.215
Let’s find out all those things, all the details. Let us write it down.

29:42.416 --> 29:47.261
Everyone of you. Whether it’s a woman, man, child, everyone can do it.

29:47.461 --> 29:50.175
Find out: "What are the questions

29:50.375 --> 29:53.367
which are not yet answered in Sahaja Yoga?"

29:53.567 --> 29:57.937
"How can we answer particular questions?"

29:58.137 --> 30:00.695
Alright? All these things can be found out.

30:00.895 --> 30:04.734
If you put your attention to it, you can easily find out what you need.

30:04.934 --> 30:08.406
Everyone has to do it. You must all be equipped.

30:08.607 --> 30:10.774
If anybody asks you a question on Sahaja Yoga

30:10.974 --> 30:14.829
and you cannot answer, I mean, how can you convince people?

30:15.029 --> 30:19.282
You take one ordinary so-called layman from Christianity,

30:19.482 --> 30:21.482
so-called Christianity again,

30:21.683 --> 30:25.754
the man is layman and the Christianity is also lay.

30:25.954 --> 30:30.577
He will give you a big lecture on Christ.

30:30.777 --> 30:33.358
Every verse in the Bible, he will tell you:

30:33.558 --> 30:39.382
"Chapters, Matthew 2, Verse 2, this is what Christ has said.

30:39.582 --> 30:43.048
That "you will be calling me Christ, Christ and I will not recognise you",

30:43.248 --> 30:48.850
telling about himself only.

30:51.970 --> 30:55.653
So you have to be absolutely equipped for it.

30:55.853 --> 30:58.239
Now you have to also know what you will confront

30:58.439 --> 31:00.997
in a particular country. For example, when I come to England,

31:01.197 --> 31:05.722
I know I have to confront these theologians and the Christ and everything.

31:05.923 --> 31:08.431
If I go to India, what I have to confront I know.

31:08.632 --> 31:14.975
I have to face it on different lines and different fronts.

31:15.187 --> 31:17.329
You don’t have to do that.

31:17.530 --> 31:19.937
Just think about your own country. For French, you have to think

31:20.137 --> 31:24.874
about France, you people have to think about this country.

31:25.074 --> 31:27.074
And then go ahead with it.

31:27.275 --> 31:31.228
You can chalk out a good programme and work it out properly.

31:31.428 --> 31:33.640
I am sure, by God’s grace, everything will work out.

31:33.840 --> 31:36.716
Because when I am going to do it now?

31:36.916 --> 31:39.255
I’m going away, as I told you, to India,

31:39.455 --> 31:42.333
and I don’t know when will I be back. You wanted to arrange

31:42.533 --> 31:47.015
my programme in England, but I think I cannot do it,

31:47.215 --> 31:49.836
because I have to go round to all the places, Europe and all that,

31:50.036 --> 31:54.078
finish that. You’d better do that touring.

31:54.278 --> 32:01.120
When I was not here, what touring did you do?

32:03.195 --> 32:06.304
Nothing.

32:07.979 --> 32:12.794
You could have toured. Now at least, these three months,

32:12.994 --> 32:16.037
when we are having a nice summer time,

32:16.237 --> 32:18.696
I’ll be travelling all over Europe, everywhere.

32:18.896 --> 32:21.946
You please see that you go round England.

32:22.146 --> 32:25.149
Visit different places, arrange programmes, talk to people,

32:25.349 --> 32:28.066
find out who are the big Johnnies there.

32:28.266 --> 32:34.808
The mayors, this, that, go and talk to them, tell them about this.

32:35.008 --> 32:38.320
That is how new programming should be done and a new dimension

32:38.520 --> 32:42.068
should be given to our Sahaja Yoga propaganda.

32:42.268 --> 32:46.356
You have done no propaganda in the right sense, in the sense that

32:46.557 --> 32:49.809
we were not so much sure about it, that we’ll work out.

32:50.010 --> 32:53.041
But now we will, because people are writing,

32:53.241 --> 32:57.960
there is an atmosphere against Christ, so we have to fight.

32:58.160 --> 33:04.249
And that is how we should become the people who are fighting for Christ.

33:04.449 --> 33:08.361
Now there could be areas where you can talk of integration,

33:08.561 --> 33:12.580
of talking about how we do not know much about Christ.

33:12.780 --> 33:15.752
That we have to go to other books to find out who He was.

33:15.952 --> 33:18.903
Why did He come on this earth? We have to go much deeper.

33:19.103 --> 33:21.090
We have to prove that there is Divine power.

33:21.290 --> 33:24.144
And you have seen how Divine power works, what wonders there are.

33:24.345 --> 33:27.079
You take my photographs. Show them: "These are the photographs,

33:27.280 --> 33:31.053
can you explain these things? That in the hand you see the sun?

33:31.254 --> 33:38.773
Show us in Mrs. Thatcher’s hand, even a star won’t twinkle."

33:40.882 --> 33:45.182
These things are to be seen in the right perspective

33:45.382 --> 33:49.919
and at the right time. We must do whatever is right at that point.

33:50.119 --> 33:52.126
That is the way Sahaja Yoga is.

33:52.327 --> 33:56.908
Hit the point when it is to be hitten.

33:57.638 --> 34:00.240
If you cannot do that way, you cannot achieve it.

34:00.440 --> 34:03.268
So this is the right time for you, there are now

34:03.469 --> 34:06.920
3 months ahead of you, I would like you to see what you can do,

34:07.120 --> 34:11.906
because now the sun will be coming out,

34:12.106 --> 34:14.312
you will have a nice summer.

34:14.512 --> 34:17.968
Go ahead. But now just do not fix all your holidays

34:18.168 --> 34:22.463
during these three months going to some beach somewhere.

34:22.663 --> 34:26.987
Sahaja Yogis have no time. They are busy people.

34:27.187 --> 34:30.858
They have no time to waste.

34:31.058 --> 34:39.813
We are on a warpath, we have no time
to quarrel among ourselves, fight.

34:40.013 --> 34:44.243
We have to fight very great enemies.

34:44.443 --> 34:47.840
We have no time to waste on our families and our children

34:48.040 --> 34:51.980
and our relations and father, mother, sister, brother.

34:52.180 --> 34:55.902
We are on a warpath, very important it is.

34:56.102 --> 35:01.672
So let us now prepare ourselves.
As Christ stood out of that grave,

35:01.873 --> 35:08.880
let us get out of this grave of lethargy, of compromising, of comfort,

35:09.080 --> 35:15.593
of our past ideas about life’s pleasures.

35:17.445 --> 35:21.905
This is the new era that has to show,

35:22.106 --> 35:26.834
it’s manifestation in this country.

35:27.034 --> 35:29.506
It is very important, and you all can do it.

35:29.706 --> 35:33.517
You have to be very brave, you have to be sensible, wise,

35:33.717 --> 35:37.000
kind and also forthright.

35:37.201 --> 35:41.095
But you have to say what you have to say, because it has to be said.

35:41.295 --> 35:45.298
And this is the only thing to be said, nothing else is important.

35:45.498 --> 35:48.408
Whatever these people talk about has no meaning.

35:48.608 --> 35:52.541
They are not mantras.

35:52.741 --> 35:56.173
Some of them are anti-God, some may not be,

35:56.373 --> 36:00.666
but they are useless, wasteful, garbages I should say.

36:00.866 --> 36:05.943
Why they are given so much importance and not the real thing that is there?

36:06.143 --> 36:14.813
You understand that this is the reality that has come into you people.

36:15.013 --> 36:18.649
Actually you have felt the reality.

36:18.849 --> 36:22.457
Actually you know the reality,

36:22.657 --> 36:28.422
you are in the reality, then why not talk about it?

36:30.227 --> 36:32.147
Why should we not?

36:32.347 --> 36:37.788
Is it not the most important thing that we have to do?

36:37.988 --> 36:40.741
If you realise it, I am sure it will work out.

36:40.941 --> 36:44.775
With all my blessings, with all my love,

36:44.975 --> 36:47.978
I really command you to do that now.

36:48.178 --> 36:52.919
May God bless you.

36:56.687 --> 36:59.370
Today, on this day you all should vow,

36:59.570 --> 37:03.120
vow that "we are on the warpath and we are going to find out

37:03.320 --> 37:05.385
ways and methods of doing these things,

37:05.586 --> 37:10.646
for these three months, we are going to work it out". Just vow.

37:10.846 --> 37:17.919
Just ask for wisdoms and the spiritual power, that’s all.

37:21.529 --> 37:29.961
And promise it to Christ that "as You did, we are going to do".

37:41.636 --> 37:46.430
May God bless you.
