00:06:05.574 --> 00:06:12.254
You can't imagine how a Mother who has so many beautiful children

00:06:12.414 --> 00:06:18.014
sees them in such joyous mood

00:06:18.174 --> 00:06:24.574
with their families, their children, nicely settled down.

00:06:24.734 --> 00:06:31.214
It's very satisfying to see you all so much

00:06:31.374 --> 00:06:39.014
in joy and complete oneness with the Divine.

00:06:40.854 --> 00:06:44.494
One has to realize only one thing:

00:06:44.654 --> 00:06:47.014
that though you are many,

00:06:47.174 --> 00:06:52.774
still compared to the population of this world, we are very few

00:06:52.934 --> 00:06:59.014
who really know the true knowledge, the real knowledge.

00:06:59.174 --> 00:07:03.094
You are the people who are knowledgeable, no doubt,

00:07:03.254 --> 00:07:11.934
but also knowledge which is not being adorned with truth

00:07:12.094 --> 00:07:16.534
or which is not the true knowledge has no meaning.

00:07:16.694 --> 00:07:22.694
All that vanishes into thin air because it is artificial.

00:07:22.854 --> 00:07:27.254
By your Kundalini awakening you all have achieved

00:07:27.414 --> 00:07:31.174
that state where we can say you know.

00:07:31.334 --> 00:07:35.414
You know what is the real knowledge is,

00:07:35.574 --> 00:07:41.694
but think of the people who do not know what knowledge is.

00:07:41.854 --> 00:07:47.334
We take, for example we say that

00:07:47.494 --> 00:07:50.494
our knowledge is nothing but love,

00:07:50.654 --> 00:07:54.174
but one should understand the discrimination.

00:07:54.334 --> 00:07:58.014
The knowledge that is love within you

00:07:58.174 --> 00:08:02.854
is just emitting out from your being.

00:08:03.014 --> 00:08:06.854
You don't have to assert, you don't have to think,

00:08:07.014 --> 00:08:09.494
you don't have to read some sort of a poetry

00:08:09.654 --> 00:08:12.054
or go into some romantic mood

00:08:12.214 --> 00:08:21.934
just pure love which emits, and this is the knowledge also.

00:08:22.094 --> 00:08:26.614
How you have to relate it is this way:

00:08:26.774 --> 00:08:33.214
the knowledge that you have about yourself is evident,

00:08:33.374 --> 00:08:36.574
is absolutely expressed on your fingertips,

00:08:36.734 --> 00:08:39.174
and about others also.

00:08:39.334 --> 00:08:43.014
You know about others and about yourself.

00:08:43.174 --> 00:08:52.214
This is the greatest subtle knowledge you have.

00:08:52.374 --> 00:08:54.094
No one knows like that.

00:08:54.254 --> 00:09:00.174
Apart from you people, no one knows about themselves or about others.

00:09:00.334 --> 00:09:03.334
So this knowledge that has come to you,

00:09:03.494 --> 00:09:08.774
which is extremely subtle,

00:09:08.934 --> 00:09:13.934
extremely secretive, absolutely secret.

00:09:14.094 --> 00:09:17.694
If you know about somebody, you know.

00:09:17.854 --> 00:09:21.694
Others do not know that you know about them,

00:09:21.854 --> 00:09:27.094
and so this knowledge that you have got is nothing but love.

00:09:27.254 --> 00:09:32.854
It's very difficult to make knowledge and love put together,

00:09:33.014 --> 00:09:36.414
because our idea of knowledge is very different,

00:09:36.574 --> 00:09:38.934
what we read from the books.

00:09:39.094 --> 00:09:42.014
How can you love from the books?

00:09:42.174 --> 00:09:44.774
What love means, our attachments

00:09:44.934 --> 00:09:48.694
to us, in ignorance we get attached

00:09:48.854 --> 00:09:55.214
to people, to children, to family, to things.

00:09:56.254 --> 00:10:02.254
By getting attachment it is proved that we do not have the knowledge.

00:10:02.414 --> 00:10:05.694
If you have the knowledge then all attachments

00:10:05.854 --> 00:10:10.094
should just drop out and you should become a global personality,

00:10:10.254 --> 00:10:11.894
a drop in the ocean.

00:10:12.054 --> 00:10:14.134
For example, we are attached to many things,

00:10:14.294 --> 00:10:18.094
like we are attached to our family.

00:10:18.254 --> 00:10:22.174
Something happens in the family we get very disturbed,

00:10:22.334 --> 00:10:23.574
we can't bear it.

00:10:23.734 --> 00:10:27.054
If anything happens to our children, we feel horrible,

00:10:27.214 --> 00:10:30.014
it's just the whole world is falling on you.

00:10:30.494 --> 00:10:36.094
Then from family you move on. You are attached to your friends,

00:10:36.254 --> 00:10:40.574
to your neighbors; you are also attached to your country.

00:10:40.734 --> 00:10:45.614
Attachment to your country is also not knowledge.

00:10:45.774 --> 00:10:48.574
Once you are a realized soul,

00:10:48.734 --> 00:10:52.414
you just start seeing your country clearly:

00:10:52.574 --> 00:10:58.854
what wrong it has got, what ignorance it has got,

00:10:59.014 --> 00:11:01.334
in what darkness it exists,

00:11:01.494 --> 00:11:07.614
and in what way it is quarrelling, fighting for rights and things.

00:11:07.774 --> 00:11:11.334
But with the knowledge that you have within yourself,

00:11:11.494 --> 00:11:16.174
you see it so clearly what is the problem of your country

00:11:16.334 --> 00:11:22.934
then you try to improve that through your love,

00:11:23.094 --> 00:11:27.374
means the power of your knowledge is love.

00:11:27.534 --> 00:11:30.014
If you have all the knowledge within you,

00:11:30.174 --> 00:11:35.494
and if you are just sitting at home and meditating, it has no meaning.

00:11:35.654 --> 00:11:39.694
What you have to go is to go about, tell people

00:11:39.854 --> 00:11:43.934
you have to meet other people, your friends, your family

00:11:44.094 --> 00:11:49.494
and other relations about your knowledge.

00:11:49.654 --> 00:11:55.374
If you cannot do that, then your knowledge is not with love.

00:11:55.534 --> 00:11:58.174
It's such a connection between the two.

00:11:58.334 --> 00:12:01.854
You feel like telling everybody that you've got your realization.

00:12:02.014 --> 00:12:06.014
You feel like telling everyone that you are a realized soul,

00:12:06.174 --> 00:12:09.254
but in that you feel that you are expressing your ego.

00:12:09.414 --> 00:12:12.774
All right, by some other ways, some other methods,

00:12:12.934 --> 00:12:17.734
you can express to them that you have the true knowledge.

00:12:18.614 --> 00:12:22.694
When you have the false knowledge you can get ego.

00:12:22.854 --> 00:12:26.614
You can think that "I know so much, I know about this,

00:12:26.774 --> 00:12:33.534
I know the color of the carpets, all the shades, everything."

00:12:33.694 --> 00:12:38.094
Any stupid thing if you know, you think that you are very great.

00:12:38.254 --> 00:12:41.094
That's the sign of stupidity in your head also,

00:12:41.254 --> 00:12:44.614
that you think this is very great to know.

00:12:44.774 --> 00:12:46.694
Now we have discovered

00:12:46.854 --> 00:12:53.134
that through all kinds of acquiring knowledge in the whole world,

00:12:53.294 --> 00:12:56.494
what we have achieved? Nothing.

00:12:56.654 --> 00:13:00.494
There are wars going on.

00:13:00.654 --> 00:13:04.334
There's all kinds of destructions coming in.

00:13:04.494 --> 00:13:10.214
I saw on the television this George.

00:13:10.374 --> 00:13:14.494
It's a whirlwind which is going round and is killing so many people;

00:13:14.654 --> 00:13:18.934
is destroying so many people without understanding what he is doing,

00:13:19.094 --> 00:13:21.894
but he's there and he's acting very well.

00:13:22.054 --> 00:13:25.214
So is it that he doesn't understand,

00:13:25.374 --> 00:13:28.134
or is it that he understands

00:13:28.294 --> 00:13:32.654
and that he is doing something just to correct people?

00:13:32.814 --> 00:13:35.334
This also we should have full idea.

00:13:35.494 --> 00:13:40.334
Like yesterday when I came here it was raining heavily,

00:13:40.494 --> 00:13:44.014
and then I sat down and suddenly it stopped,

00:13:44.174 --> 00:13:46.774
stopped till the whole program was over.

00:13:46.934 --> 00:13:51.414
Till I spoke it was not working,

00:13:51.574 --> 00:13:56.094
but suddenly when you started clapping, also it started clapping

00:13:56.254 --> 00:14:04.334
that's what it was. So even the nature knows who you are,

00:14:04.494 --> 00:14:08.014
but you must know the nature, this is the point.

00:14:08.174 --> 00:14:14.614
Nature will act according to what your level of spirituality is.

00:14:14.774 --> 00:14:17.134
Surprisingly I always felt

00:14:17.294 --> 00:14:20.174
that there cannot be levels of spirituality.

00:14:20.334 --> 00:14:24.254
I felt that once you get realization you are there,

00:14:24.414 --> 00:14:28.254
but later on discovered I was wrong; it is not so.

00:14:28.414 --> 00:14:31.294
Even after getting realization, I found

00:14:31.454 --> 00:14:37.254
people had so many obstructions in rising.

00:14:37.414 --> 00:14:42.494
There were so many temptations which were keeping them down.

00:14:42.654 --> 00:14:49.174
So one had to work out on different chakras, different nadis,

00:14:49.334 --> 00:14:52.174
somehow or other to make you perfect,

00:14:52.334 --> 00:14:56.054
because the perfection within only will give you

00:14:56.214 --> 00:15:00.094
the authority to use this knowledge.

00:15:00.254 --> 00:15:03.974
There are as I told you two ways of doing it.

00:15:04.134 --> 00:15:08.054
The other day I told you that you should not react.

00:15:08.214 --> 00:15:10.574
It's human nature to react.

00:15:10.734 --> 00:15:12.294
It's absolutely human,

00:15:12.454 --> 00:15:16.254
but if you have to become superhuman, you should not react.

00:15:16.414 --> 00:15:20.094
By not reacting you will grow, definitely you'll grow,

00:15:20.254 --> 00:15:23.094
but if you react then you cannot grow,

00:15:23.254 --> 00:15:28.134
because you are working under the pressure of other thing

00:15:28.294 --> 00:15:30.214
that is not yourself.

00:15:30.374 --> 00:15:33.054
Now supposing as I said I see these carpets,

00:15:33.214 --> 00:15:35.334
I know the color and this and that,

00:15:35.494 --> 00:15:37.774
and I react to it - finished.

00:15:37.934 --> 00:15:42.574
I will not have any sense of judgment if I react to it,

00:15:42.734 --> 00:15:44.574
but if I don't react,

00:15:44.734 --> 00:15:49.014
then I'll know whether these carpets have got vibrations or not.

00:15:49.174 --> 00:15:51.534
Are they emitting vibrations or not?

00:15:51.694 --> 00:15:57.334
Now what are these vibrations? That is the love.

00:15:57.494 --> 00:16:00.334
So the communication is like this: if you have the light

00:16:00.494 --> 00:16:02.694
you can see things.

00:16:02.854 --> 00:16:05.334
So when you see things the light is there,

00:16:05.494 --> 00:16:08.174
and light gives you the perception,

00:16:08.334 --> 00:16:10.934
gives you the vision to see things.

00:16:11.094 --> 00:16:14.094
In the same way when you are enlightened,

00:16:14.254 --> 00:16:18.134
what happens that these vibrations start flowing,

00:16:18.294 --> 00:16:19.694
just like the light,

00:16:19.854 --> 00:16:25.014
and in that light you can see things which are good and which are bad.

00:16:25.174 --> 00:16:33.014
But sometimes you put the same parameters as human beings do.

00:16:33.174 --> 00:16:38.254
Like you go to some house, a very nice house, very good house.

00:16:38.414 --> 00:16:41.254
All these things make you very happy;

00:16:41.414 --> 00:16:44.654
but actually, what about that house?

00:16:44.814 --> 00:16:52.174
Is it having good vibrations or it's having bad vibrations?

00:16:52.334 --> 00:16:55.414
Is it worth living there or not?

00:16:55.574 --> 00:16:57.934
Like the other day they told Me they can

00:16:58.094 --> 00:17:00.894
get a very nice place in Milan,

00:17:01.054 --> 00:17:04.694
little beyond Milan, on rent, very cheap.

00:17:04.854 --> 00:17:07.334
I said, "Why is it so cheap?"

00:17:07.494 --> 00:17:10.174
Immediately I felt the vibrations of the place.

00:17:10.334 --> 00:17:13.854
I said, "Did you go and see the vibrations of that place?"

00:17:14.014 --> 00:17:17.014
They went and saw - this was all burning.

00:17:17.174 --> 00:17:21.334
Then they found out that there was a Scientology there for years together.

00:17:21.494 --> 00:17:24.934
I said, "That's not the place where you can live.

00:17:25.094 --> 00:17:28.734
You have to have a very pure place.

00:17:28.894 --> 00:17:32.974
Even hut of a poor man would be better

00:17:33.134 --> 00:17:35.854
than this comfortable so-called place."

00:17:36.014 --> 00:17:40.134
So one has to use the vibrations all the time

00:17:40.294 --> 00:17:43.374
to understand everything that you are doing.

00:17:43.534 --> 00:17:45.894
In that also it can be misleading them.

00:17:46.054 --> 00:17:48.654
Some people feel vibrations

00:17:48.814 --> 00:17:51.854
and they tell Me, "Mother, I felt the vibrations

00:17:52.014 --> 00:17:54.654
and I felt I should marry this man."

00:17:54.814 --> 00:17:57.494
I said, "You did fel the vibrations?" "Yes"

00:17:57.654 --> 00:18:01.334
"Yes I did, very much, and I must marry this man."

00:18:01.494 --> 00:18:04.414
And when I see the man I see the bhoot in him.

00:18:04.574 --> 00:18:09.374
I said, "My God, what sort of vibrations this lady

00:18:09.534 --> 00:18:10.694
has felt about him?"

00:18:10.854 --> 00:18:15.214
So in your judgment what is there: there's no pure knowledge.

00:18:15.374 --> 00:18:19.774
So see how, how connected they are

00:18:19.934 --> 00:18:22.774
vibrations which is love;

00:18:22.934 --> 00:18:29.174
and also the other thing which you have to have is the knowledge,

00:18:29.334 --> 00:18:31.934
the pure knowledge, the true knowledge.

00:18:32.094 --> 00:18:37.974
We can say that pure knowledge and true knowledge is like the energy

00:18:38.134 --> 00:18:40.094
like electricity.

00:18:40.254 --> 00:18:47.574
And the way you feel it, the way you understand it,

00:18:47.734 --> 00:18:52.094
it exists. That is love.

00:18:52.254 --> 00:18:56.174
People don't understand also what is the love is.

00:18:56.334 --> 00:19:00.094
They get mad after someone and say that,

00:19:00.254 --> 00:19:04.094
"Mother, I say I think that I am in love with that person."

00:19:04.254 --> 00:19:06.494
And after five days they'll come and say,

00:19:06.654 --> 00:19:10.334
"Mother, no, I won't have anything to do with that person."

00:19:10.494 --> 00:19:15.494
Why? Because you have not got the pure knowledge.

00:19:15.654 --> 00:19:19.974
You did not feel the pure knowledge

00:19:20.134 --> 00:19:22.934
in that person through your vibrations.

00:19:23.094 --> 00:19:25.214
Now see how connected it is.

00:19:25.374 --> 00:19:28.054
Like we can say the sun and the sunlight,

00:19:28.214 --> 00:19:30.614
what is the difference between the two?

00:19:30.774 --> 00:19:34.334
Sun is there. When sun comes, there's sunlight.

00:19:34.494 --> 00:19:36.294
So what is the difference?

00:19:36.454 --> 00:19:41.014
Or we can say the moon and the moonlight; what is the difference?

00:19:41.174 --> 00:19:45.014
There is no difference in these two things

00:19:45.174 --> 00:19:48.414
one is the moon and another is the light.

00:19:48.574 --> 00:19:55.414
So all these things are very, very confusing,

00:19:55.574 --> 00:19:59.494
that we don't understand how confused we are about it,

00:19:59.654 --> 00:20:05.614
and we don't understand how our vibrations can mislead us.

00:20:05.774 --> 00:20:11.014
Because vibrations are there, all right,

00:20:11.174 --> 00:20:14.494
but sometimes even if they are missing,

00:20:14.654 --> 00:20:17.414
just to justify yourself you will say,

00:20:17.574 --> 00:20:23.334
"We have vibrations and we feel that it's very good, excellent,"

00:20:23.494 --> 00:20:27.014
and later on you'll discover that it's not so.

00:20:27.174 --> 00:20:30.694
So even now when we are realized souls,

00:20:30.854 --> 00:20:36.494
we should know what is encompassing us, which is around us;

00:20:36.654 --> 00:20:41.854
what is that which makes us feel that

00:20:42.014 --> 00:20:46.094
it's all right, it is good, we should have it.

00:20:46.254 --> 00:20:52.614
Once we start understanding that vibrations of pure knowledge

00:20:52.774 --> 00:20:55.774
are of a very different nature,

00:20:55.934 --> 00:20:58.734
then you're not attached to that person,

00:20:58.894 --> 00:21:01.014
you're not attached to that family,

00:21:01.174 --> 00:21:04.254
you're not attached to that country - nothing.

00:21:04.414 --> 00:21:09.854
But what you feel is the pure vibrations coming to you.

00:21:10.014 --> 00:21:12.854
This is the point which is very confusing

00:21:13.014 --> 00:21:17.214
when you say, "My vibrations are good. I like those vibrations"

00:21:17.374 --> 00:21:23.014
and while you jump into the ocean of filth.

00:21:23.174 --> 00:21:25.094
Many people have asked Me, "Mother,

00:21:25.254 --> 00:21:28.414
why is it sometimes we make mistakes?"

00:21:28.574 --> 00:21:33.854
You do not make mistakes. It's your ignorance, which is darkness,

00:21:34.014 --> 00:21:38.534
and that's why whenever you plunge into it you fall into trouble.

00:21:38.694 --> 00:21:47.014
So to understand that our knowledge has to be completely clear.

00:21:47.174 --> 00:21:51.534
Like in our house supposing we have a lamp that's dirty,

00:21:51.694 --> 00:21:53.774
you cannot get the light.

00:21:53.934 --> 00:21:57.574
In the same way if our heart is not clean

00:21:57.734 --> 00:22:01.014
specially our heart, if it is not clean,

00:22:01.174 --> 00:22:06.014
then we start doing things believing that it's right,

00:22:06.174 --> 00:22:10.254
and by which we hurt yourself or others.

00:22:10.414 --> 00:22:14.334
It's a very, very common error in human nature

00:22:14.494 --> 00:22:19.174
to identify wrong things as right

00:22:19.334 --> 00:22:27.494
and just to make themselves look such a great, such a divine thing.

00:22:27.654 --> 00:22:30.574
As I told you now there are people who want to

00:22:30.734 --> 00:22:33.094
say, divide the country;

00:22:33.254 --> 00:22:36.174
simple reason they want to divide.

00:22:36.334 --> 00:22:39.814
Now they want to divide this thing

00:22:39.974 --> 00:22:42.254
because they want to have importance.

00:22:42.414 --> 00:22:44.934
The few people who want their importance

00:22:45.094 --> 00:22:49.174
will instigate others, tell them, "All right, we must have freedom.

00:22:49.334 --> 00:22:52.734
If we have freedom we'll have this country for ourselves

00:22:52.894 --> 00:22:54.694
then we can develop ourselves."

00:22:54.854 --> 00:22:58.614
Or a part of the country which is richer, which is better off,

00:22:58.774 --> 00:23:01.254
they will think that "It's all right, we'll have

00:23:01.414 --> 00:23:04.494
all the money to ourselves, we'll have everything to ourselves,"

00:23:04.654 --> 00:23:09.574
so they divide. They can divide in the name of religion,

00:23:09.734 --> 00:23:13.014
in the name of prosperity - whatever it is.

00:23:13.174 --> 00:23:18.534
But if you divide the country actually you are facing a big problem,

00:23:18.694 --> 00:23:24.934
because you have seen that wherever people divide they fall into

00:23:25.094 --> 00:23:33.494
a kind of a dark, dark dungeon from where they cannot come out.

00:23:33.654 --> 00:23:35.614
It's just a few people

00:23:35.774 --> 00:23:42.454
whose ego is that they want to have some land as their own,

00:23:42.614 --> 00:23:47.214
but they die; not only die, some of them are murdered,

00:23:47.374 --> 00:23:50.494
and like that idea

00:23:50.654 --> 00:23:54.774
that idea that "We'll have this possession of the land" goes away.

00:23:54.934 --> 00:23:59.414
So in the same way we can see on smaller things also.

00:23:59.574 --> 00:24:02.854
In smaller things also we are very much identified,

00:24:03.014 --> 00:24:06.774
that "If I have this thing then everything will be fine."

00:24:06.934 --> 00:24:11.094
You cannot understand how people just jump at things and say,

00:24:11.254 --> 00:24:13.694
"Oh Mother, this is ours,

00:24:13.854 --> 00:24:20.694
this is ours, we must do this for ourselves," openly.

00:24:20.854 --> 00:24:24.134
They don't think it's wrong to say that

00:24:24.294 --> 00:24:27.574
"This is my country; I must do for my country."

00:24:27.734 --> 00:24:32.094
And another says that "This is my country; I must do for my country."

00:24:32.254 --> 00:24:34.774
As long as there is this "my and I"

00:24:34.934 --> 00:24:38.014
that means there is no knowledge.

00:24:38.174 --> 00:24:40.654
The knowledge as I told you, pure knowledge

00:24:40.814 --> 00:24:44.534
is that which gives you a pure light.

00:24:44.694 --> 00:24:46.934
Pure light means pure vibrations.

00:24:47.094 --> 00:24:49.934
Now vibrations can be misleading as I told you,

00:24:50.094 --> 00:24:54.294
or could be the quantity of vibrations can be less or more.

00:24:54.454 --> 00:24:58.854
But there's another way to see - is to see for yourself,

00:24:59.014 --> 00:25:02.414
why do you want to do a particular thing?

00:25:02.574 --> 00:25:08.094
Mental also you can use, parameter of mental understanding.

00:25:08.254 --> 00:25:12.694
"Why do I want to do it? What is the gain for all the people?"

00:25:12.854 --> 00:25:16.014
If you start thinking from that angle

00:25:16.174 --> 00:25:19.014
that "What is the gain for others, what will they gain by this,

00:25:19.174 --> 00:25:21.414
why should I do it?" - you'll be amazed.

00:25:21.574 --> 00:25:25.334
You will get the real picture of what you are doing.

00:25:25.494 --> 00:25:30.054
So you must keep yourself all the time

00:25:30.214 --> 00:25:32.734
in a state where you witness yourself.

00:25:32.894 --> 00:25:38.334
You see yourself, that "Why am I doing this? What is the purpose?"

00:25:38.494 --> 00:25:41.014
Sometimes it could be some conditioning,

00:25:41.174 --> 00:25:45.014
could be some sort of a psychological thing, could be anything.

00:25:45.174 --> 00:25:49.614
But if you start watching carefully "Why I'm doing it?"

00:25:49.774 --> 00:25:53.734
you'd be amazed that your vibrations itself

00:25:53.894 --> 00:25:56.694
will start telling you on your fingertips.

00:25:56.854 --> 00:26:00.414
But sometimes the vibrations are so superficially coming,

00:26:00.574 --> 00:26:04.774
"Ah, I got the vibrations, I'm this, I'm that."

00:26:04.934 --> 00:26:07.614
For this reason I am saying again and again,

00:26:07.774 --> 00:26:10.214
though you are such a nice family of Mine

00:26:10.374 --> 00:26:12.414
and we are all so much blessed

00:26:12.574 --> 00:26:16.374
and we have so much of knowledge with us,

00:26:16.534 --> 00:26:20.534
we should be very wise.

00:26:20.694 --> 00:26:24.934
If there is no wisdom, if there is no wisdom,

00:26:25.094 --> 00:26:28.774
we can never understand what we are doing.

00:26:28.934 --> 00:26:32.014
Now to develop this wisdom, what have you to do?

00:26:32.174 --> 00:26:35.614
See every time, if I say anything they'll come otherwise,

00:26:35.774 --> 00:26:40.534
"Mother, how do we get wisdom? What is the way to get the wisdom?"

00:26:40.694 --> 00:26:43.174
Wisdom you have already within you,

00:26:43.334 --> 00:26:47.014
Shri Ganesha is already there, who gives you the wisdom.

00:26:47.174 --> 00:26:50.414
But you must take to Shri Ganesh.

00:26:50.574 --> 00:26:54.414
There I find people become so much addicted to Shri Ganesh

00:26:54.574 --> 00:26:59.614
that they lose His identity completely,

00:26:59.774 --> 00:27:06.694
they become very slavish about the whole thing

00:27:06.854 --> 00:27:09.414
and they just believe that,

00:27:09.574 --> 00:27:14.614
oh, they are very spiritual, they are very great.

00:27:14.774 --> 00:27:18.894
All these false ideas are no good.

00:27:19.054 --> 00:27:23.374
Does your Ganesha gives you wisdom?

00:27:23.534 --> 00:27:29.574
Now you must count, how many wise things have you done so far?

00:27:29.734 --> 00:27:34.334
Where did you take a very wise decision?

00:27:34.494 --> 00:27:37.334
Have you been wise to do something,

00:27:37.494 --> 00:27:40.934
or you have been just doing it because you are identified

00:27:41.094 --> 00:27:46.694
with a particular type of life or particular type of answer?

00:27:46.854 --> 00:27:52.254
So wisdom is a thing that gives you, first of all, complete peace.

00:27:52.414 --> 00:27:57.014
If your wisdom is developed then you become very peaceful.

00:27:57.174 --> 00:28:00.374
Because whatever people may say, whatever they may do,

00:28:00.534 --> 00:28:04.174
whatever aggression they may do, whatever it is, you are peaceful.

00:28:04.334 --> 00:28:09.014
And you see the stupidity of the other person, of the other nations,

00:28:09.174 --> 00:28:12.334
and you understand why they are doing it.

00:28:12.494 --> 00:28:16.334
This wisdom is such an important thing in human being,

00:28:16.494 --> 00:28:21.174
because animals don't have so much wisdom as we have.

00:28:21.334 --> 00:28:25.294
Sometimes of course, sometimes we have even less than animals have.

00:28:25.454 --> 00:28:29.414
But still, by experience, you see,

00:28:29.574 --> 00:28:32.934
we have to learn that we have been making mistakes.

00:28:33.094 --> 00:28:35.694
So many mistakes we have committed so far.

00:28:35.854 --> 00:28:41.094
Now are we going to commit more mistakes or are we going to be wise?

00:28:41.254 --> 00:28:44.814
Wisdom is not apparent outside.

00:28:44.974 --> 00:28:50.254
You can't say somebody is wise by looking at that person,

00:28:50.414 --> 00:28:54.894
but in vibrations you will know that that person is extremely wise.

00:28:55.054 --> 00:28:57.094
He may speak; he may not speak.

00:28:57.254 --> 00:29:02.534
If he speaks he'll speak about something so deep,

00:29:02.694 --> 00:29:07.014
so wise, and so nice, without hurting you.

00:29:07.174 --> 00:29:09.694
This kind of a temperament

00:29:09.854 --> 00:29:14.174
if you develop is to become wise for every question.

00:29:14.334 --> 00:29:18.094
For example, some are very attached to their children;

00:29:18.254 --> 00:29:22.934
so much attached that they forget that they are part and parcel

00:29:23.094 --> 00:29:25.254
of this divine Force,

00:29:25.414 --> 00:29:28.094
and they just start doing all kinds of things.

00:29:28.254 --> 00:29:32.494
The other day I met one lady whose son was very sick,

00:29:32.654 --> 00:29:34.734
and she took him to the hospital

00:29:34.894 --> 00:29:37.334
and doctors gave him all kinds of medicines,

00:29:37.494 --> 00:29:39.614
and he became even worse.

00:29:39.774 --> 00:29:42.934
Then she telephones to Me, "Mother, I don't know what happened,

00:29:43.094 --> 00:29:47.494
I went to the doctor and doctor gave him this and that treatment,

00:29:47.654 --> 00:29:49.774
and the child has become sick."

00:29:49.934 --> 00:29:52.334
But why didn't you ask Me before?

00:29:52.494 --> 00:29:55.094
Why did you go to the hospital first?

00:29:55.254 --> 00:29:59.694
Lack of wisdom. I'm there, why don't you ask?

00:29:59.854 --> 00:30:02.334
We had one case here in Cabella.

00:30:02.494 --> 00:30:07.934
There was one child who fell down and broke his arm.

00:30:08.094 --> 00:30:11.174
Now the mother didn't show any wisdom.

00:30:11.334 --> 00:30:13.334
She took the child to the hospital

00:30:13.494 --> 00:30:15.774
and the doctor said, "Tomorrow we are going to operate her

00:30:15.934 --> 00:30:18.814
and put some artificial arm inside."

00:30:18.974 --> 00:30:23.334
But the father was sensible. He said, "All right, tomorrow, no?

00:30:23.494 --> 00:30:25.454
Today I'll take the child at home."

00:30:25.614 --> 00:30:28.494
He brought the child to Me in the night about three o'clock.

00:30:28.654 --> 00:30:31.774
I said, "All right." I put it right.

00:30:31.934 --> 00:30:35.174
Next day when he took it to the hospital the doctor said,

00:30:35.334 --> 00:30:39.334
"But now there's no need to operate because his arm is all right."

00:30:39.494 --> 00:30:40.774
See the difference?

00:30:40.934 --> 00:30:44.614
One is worried, immediately they'll go to the doctor,

00:30:44.774 --> 00:30:48.574
instead of consulting Me, asking Me. They are Sahaja yogis,

00:30:48.734 --> 00:30:52.694
but they will go and ask the doctor to do something or other.

00:30:52.854 --> 00:30:56.454
Once the doctors start doing something then they'll come to Me.

00:30:56.614 --> 00:31:01.534
There's lots of miracles must have taken place

00:31:01.694 --> 00:31:03.934
about Sahaja Yoga, I must say,

00:31:04.094 --> 00:31:08.094
and in that you should see the wisdom helps you.

00:31:08.254 --> 00:31:11.694
Of course My attention is there always, no doubt,

00:31:11.854 --> 00:31:18.174
but still you should not take it for granted; you have to ask.

00:31:18.334 --> 00:31:21.854
One day, you see, I was just sitting; I just thought

00:31:22.014 --> 00:31:27.174
that I should telephone somebody in the ashram of New York.

00:31:27.334 --> 00:31:29.294
I never telephone there.

00:31:29.454 --> 00:31:36.934
So I found out the phone number, we telephoned and asked if ...

00:31:37.094 --> 00:31:45.134
I said, "Is the child all right?" So the leader there was surprised,

00:31:45.294 --> 00:31:47.894
because that boy had fallen in the water

00:31:48.054 --> 00:31:51.174
and was in the water for quite some time,

00:31:51.334 --> 00:31:54.574
and he was all filled with water, even his brain was

00:31:54.734 --> 00:31:58.654
filled with water. As usual there were some doctors who said

00:31:58.814 --> 00:32:01.494
that he cannot survive and even if he survives,

00:32:01.654 --> 00:32:06.014
his brain has so much water that he cannot be normal.

00:32:06.174 --> 00:32:12.494
So I just said that "Don't worry." I didn't know. Nobody told Me.

00:32:12.654 --> 00:32:16.854
"Don't worry. The boy will be all right completely."

00:32:17.014 --> 00:32:20.814
So they were surprised how I said so.

00:32:20.974 --> 00:32:23.254
Firstly how I knew

00:32:23.414 --> 00:32:25.774
that the boy had fallen, there was some boy like that.

00:32:25.934 --> 00:32:30.454
And then they didn't know how I said he'll be all right,

00:32:30.614 --> 00:32:34.934
and he was all right. He's perfectly all right.

00:32:35.094 --> 00:32:40.494
So they were surprised at My knowing about it

00:32:40.654 --> 00:32:47.414
how is it that Mother knows that there's a boy who is so sick?

00:32:47.574 --> 00:32:52.494
Here I will say it is pure knowledge.

00:32:52.654 --> 00:32:56.614
You see, My attention is always around you people

00:32:56.774 --> 00:32:59.414
always dealing with you people.

00:32:59.574 --> 00:33:05.414
And how I know is this: that this attention of Mine is global

00:33:05.574 --> 00:33:09.854
so anything happens to you, any upsetting takes place, any,

00:33:10.014 --> 00:33:15.494
I should say, deviation takes place

00:33:15.654 --> 00:33:17.934
My attention is there.

00:33:18.094 --> 00:33:21.494
And immediately I know there's something wrong somewhere,

00:33:21.694 --> 00:33:25.654
and I don't know how My attention goes to particular places,

00:33:25.814 --> 00:33:29.174
which makes it

00:33:29.334 --> 00:33:35.174
life better, it helps people in need.

00:33:35.334 --> 00:33:38.214
I don't do anything about this attention

00:33:38.374 --> 00:33:41.254
but this attention is the wisdom,

00:33:41.414 --> 00:33:43.694
the wisdom that spreads all over.

00:33:43.854 --> 00:33:48.614
With that wisdom you know what's wrong with another person

00:33:48.774 --> 00:33:53.534
or any other organization that is in Sahaja Yoga.

00:33:53.694 --> 00:33:55.814
Everything you come to know.

00:33:55.974 --> 00:34:00.054
If you want to know it's different, it just you know.

00:34:00.214 --> 00:34:02.334
Like you spread out everywhere.

00:34:02.494 --> 00:34:04.014
For example, if you have to telephone,

00:34:04.174 --> 00:34:05.934
then you have to use the telephone,

00:34:06.094 --> 00:34:09.774
but for Me I don't have to use the telephone, I just know.

00:34:09.934 --> 00:34:14.614
So this has come from a pure innocent wisdom.

00:34:14.774 --> 00:34:18.814
The innocent wisdom is just like a child

00:34:18.974 --> 00:34:22.014
It is everywhere, and it communicates

00:34:22.174 --> 00:34:26.974
and it tells what's the matter, what's the problem is.

00:34:27.134 --> 00:34:30.934
Many people have been cured with Sahaja Yoga, many have been cured.

00:34:31.094 --> 00:34:34.134
Now if they can say that "Mother, how did we get cured,

00:34:34.294 --> 00:34:37.214
what have You done? Did You see our chakras?

00:34:37.374 --> 00:34:40.054
Did You find out what was wrong with us?"

00:34:40.214 --> 00:34:44.174
No, I haven't. I haven't, but I leave it,

00:34:44.334 --> 00:34:48.974
in My wisdom I leave it to Paramchaitanya to do the job.

00:34:49.134 --> 00:34:51.854
This is the main point is, that can you leave

00:34:52.014 --> 00:34:56.494
that can you leave everything to Paramchaitanya in your wisdom?

00:34:56.654 --> 00:34:59.654
If you cannot, then yet you have not felt

00:34:59.814 --> 00:35:04.014
the real knowledge within you.

00:35:04.174 --> 00:35:06.374
That is the level of some people are.

00:35:06.534 --> 00:35:10.214
I am not now so sure about those who get realization

00:35:10.374 --> 00:35:13.214
are all so much filled with pure knowledge.

00:35:13.374 --> 00:35:16.254
Some of them are, but not all of them.

00:35:16.414 --> 00:35:22.534
With experience they learn. With meeting people, they learn.

00:35:22.694 --> 00:35:27.934
But as the wisdom, pure wisdom, is difficult for them

00:35:28.094 --> 00:35:35.254
because they do not rely entirely on the Paramchaitanya.

00:35:35.414 --> 00:35:41.414
Everything happens, just Paramchaitanya knows,

00:35:41.574 --> 00:35:44.654
it understands, it organizes, it loves,

00:35:44.814 --> 00:35:49.374
it does everything. That's the Energy it is. It does everything.

00:35:49.534 --> 00:35:54.734
And how it manages, how we call coincidences are really organized

00:35:54.894 --> 00:35:56.614
by Paramchaitanya.

00:35:56.774 --> 00:36:01.334
As I told you yesterday the way the rain was,

00:36:01.494 --> 00:36:08.254
the rain came and went away. It has wisdom.

00:36:08.414 --> 00:36:13.414
Innately it knows I am sitting here, the program is going to start

00:36:13.574 --> 00:36:15.094
stops!

00:36:15.254 --> 00:36:17.014
Flowers know Me.

00:36:17.174 --> 00:36:19.774
You don't know, when we have flowers,

00:36:19.934 --> 00:36:22.614
they are of this size, I don't do anything to them;

00:36:22.774 --> 00:36:26.134
they start growing, growing like this, they blast like that.

00:36:26.294 --> 00:36:28.854
Now one would say, "Mother, how do they know?"

00:36:29.014 --> 00:36:33.774
Because they are natural. We are unnatural.

00:36:33.934 --> 00:36:38.614
We have taken so many artificialities as part and parcel of life.

00:36:38.774 --> 00:36:43.494
See all kinds of courtesies, this, that - all that's not necessary.

00:36:43.654 --> 00:36:47.494
All these stupid practices

00:36:47.654 --> 00:36:50.614
that we have adopted sometimes keep us away

00:36:50.774 --> 00:36:55.454
from pure knowledge. And when there's no pure knowledge,

00:36:55.614 --> 00:36:57.414
we don't know anything what's happening.

00:36:57.574 --> 00:37:00.974
We just get frightened for small things, upset for something.

00:37:01.134 --> 00:37:03.774
I mean it's something very surprising to see

00:37:03.934 --> 00:37:06.934
Sahaja yogis getting upset.

00:37:07.094 --> 00:37:10.974
Among the hundred people if supposing there's a problem,

00:37:11.134 --> 00:37:19.494
so if you are a Sahaja yogi you have to just witness, and see.

00:37:19.654 --> 00:37:24.494
If you cannot do that then you are not a Sahaja yogi.

00:37:24.654 --> 00:37:30.934
But it's not like practicing, you know, like they say

00:37:31.094 --> 00:37:36.494
if you have to have the blessings of Shiva,

00:37:36.654 --> 00:37:39.854
you must say a hundred-and-eight times His name.

00:37:40.014 --> 00:37:42.854
That's not the way - He doesn't like it.

00:37:43.014 --> 00:37:47.934
You see, nobody likes that kind of a murmuring.

00:37:48.094 --> 00:37:51.294
You see somebody comes and takes your name all the time

00:37:51.454 --> 00:37:53.694
near your door, you will throw him out.

00:37:53.854 --> 00:37:56.294
So that's not the way, this is a wrong idea

00:37:56.454 --> 00:37:59.254
that you go on taking the name of somebody

00:37:59.414 --> 00:38:04.454
and that deity will help you.

00:38:04.614 --> 00:38:09.534
First of all you have to become wise enough to understand

00:38:09.694 --> 00:38:15.494
that you are a part and parcel of Paramchaitanya.

00:38:15.654 --> 00:38:18.694
Everything will work out by that,

00:38:18.854 --> 00:38:21.934
and it works out so beautifully.

00:38:22.094 --> 00:38:25.814
Of course some people have hard time, I don't say they don't have.

00:38:25.974 --> 00:38:30.374
But it is not hard, because if you are one with Paramchaitanya

00:38:30.534 --> 00:38:33.854
and you know that it is doing the job, you are not feeling

00:38:34.014 --> 00:38:39.254
that hardness or sickness or anything.

00:38:39.414 --> 00:38:43.294
All the people who'll write to Me about their problems,

00:38:43.454 --> 00:38:45.174
I don't know what to say.

00:38:45.334 --> 00:38:48.934
Could just say that "Do you believe in Paramchaitanya?"

00:38:49.094 --> 00:38:54.174
All right. It knows. It knows what is to be done.

00:38:54.334 --> 00:38:58.774
It knows what is to be corrected. It knows what is to be said.

00:38:58.934 --> 00:39:03.294
See, it can create poetry, it can create music, it can create everything;

00:39:03.454 --> 00:39:07.454
but do you leave everything to the Paramchaitanya?

00:39:07.614 --> 00:39:10.014
This is the second point in wisdom:

00:39:10.174 --> 00:39:15.494
do you have wisdom to leave everything to Paramchaitanya?

00:39:15.654 --> 00:39:18.254
After experiencing also.

00:39:18.414 --> 00:39:21.094
Like there was one lady who was going in the car

00:39:21.254 --> 00:39:27.174
and she found her car and the brakes weren't braking,

00:39:27.334 --> 00:39:31.094
and she didn't know what to do. Now if the brakes are no more,

00:39:31.254 --> 00:39:33.534
how will she manage? It was in Germany,

00:39:33.694 --> 00:39:36.254
and all the cars were moving very fast

00:39:36.414 --> 00:39:39.814
and she didn't know what to do. So she put her head

00:39:39.974 --> 00:39:47.694
on the steering wheel and she said, "I leave it to Paramchaitanya."

00:39:47.854 --> 00:39:51.254
She said, she leaves it to Me - all right, this is the same.

00:39:51.414 --> 00:39:55.494
So by saying that, what happened? She said, "Mother I don't know,

00:39:55.654 --> 00:39:59.374
when I raised my head I found my car was taken

00:39:59.534 --> 00:40:08.614
on one side of the road and nobody was there.

00:40:08.774 --> 00:40:10.854
All the cars were passing by,

00:40:11.014 --> 00:40:14.094
but somehow or other this car was taken there

00:40:14.254 --> 00:40:16.854
very nicely by some Force."

00:40:17.014 --> 00:40:22.334
So the wisdom lies in understanding the working of Paramchaitanya:

00:40:22.494 --> 00:40:26.774
how it guides you, how it helps you, how it preserves you;

00:40:26.934 --> 00:40:29.694
how, depending on Paramchaitanya,

00:40:29.854 --> 00:40:36.374
you can continue to be living very happily.

00:40:36.534 --> 00:40:41.494
I think in Sahaja Yoga we have lost very few Sahaja yogis.

00:40:41.654 --> 00:40:44.774
They live for long, they don't die,

00:40:44.934 --> 00:40:49.254
and if you ask their experiences, it's very amazing

00:40:49.414 --> 00:40:51.934
how it works out.

00:40:52.094 --> 00:40:56.414
If they don't want to live also they can pass,

00:40:56.574 --> 00:40:59.654
but if they want to live, Paramchaitanya takes over

00:40:59.814 --> 00:41:01.414
and you can live long.

00:41:01.574 --> 00:41:05.174
But living long doesn't mean that you go on bothering yourself

00:41:05.334 --> 00:41:07.934
as to what you will do with your money,

00:41:08.094 --> 00:41:12.014
how will you live, what will be the source.

00:41:12.174 --> 00:41:15.574
All these nonsensical things, worries, come to you, all right.

00:41:15.734 --> 00:41:21.934
Then the Paramchaitanya says, "All right, go on worrying."

00:41:22.094 --> 00:41:25.934
If you go on worrying, all right go on worrying, doesn't matter.

00:41:26.094 --> 00:41:28.654
What will happen?

00:41:28.814 --> 00:41:31.174
Whatever has to happen will happen.

00:41:31.334 --> 00:41:33.814
But Paramchaitanya can interfere,

00:41:33.974 --> 00:41:36.694
in case you leave it to Paramchaitanya.

00:41:36.854 --> 00:41:41.694
It's said many a times, "Leave it to God, leave it to God,"

00:41:41.854 --> 00:41:46.334
but "God" means ... I don't know what they mean by God.

00:41:46.494 --> 00:41:48.814
God means Paramchaitanya,

00:41:48.974 --> 00:41:55.534
God means living divine Force that is working everything.

00:41:55.694 --> 00:41:58.574
So the another way of looking at it

00:41:58.734 --> 00:42:01.334
is the wisdom that we should understand,

00:42:01.494 --> 00:42:07.534
that each and every particle of this world is created by Divine,

00:42:07.694 --> 00:42:09.294
by the divine Force.

00:42:09.454 --> 00:42:14.254
And this particle and everything is completely under

00:42:14.414 --> 00:42:19.254
the guidance and supervision of Paramchaitanya.

00:42:19.414 --> 00:42:24.334
Nothing can move unless until Paramchaitanya works on them.

00:42:24.494 --> 00:42:28.694
It is something so connected; globally it's so much there

00:42:28.854 --> 00:42:31.334
that people don't realize

00:42:31.494 --> 00:42:36.014
what they are doing, what they should have done.

00:42:36.174 --> 00:42:40.534
I mean on many scales you find something happening.

00:42:40.694 --> 00:42:45.534
Like supposing something is happening now in America.

00:42:45.694 --> 00:42:51.814
Just try to find out what America has done to other countries;

00:42:51.974 --> 00:42:54.414
immediately you'll get the answer.

00:42:54.574 --> 00:42:58.374
So also it takes

00:42:58.534 --> 00:43:03.534
full care of the persons who believe in Paramchaitanya,

00:43:03.694 --> 00:43:07.014
who give everything in the hands of Paramchaitanya.

00:43:07.174 --> 00:43:11.534
We give things to the police, we'll give to the doctors,

00:43:11.694 --> 00:43:14.854
we give it to the some civil people,

00:43:15.014 --> 00:43:17.494
civil what you call them, engineers

00:43:17.654 --> 00:43:20.174
to do some things.

00:43:20.334 --> 00:43:29.014
But they can make mistakes; they can create problems.

00:43:29.174 --> 00:43:31.774
But you leave it to Paramchaitanya.

00:43:31.934 --> 00:43:36.614
It's something so remarkable that in My own life

00:43:36.774 --> 00:43:42.014
I have seen that all the time it works for Me.

00:43:42.174 --> 00:43:46.254
I was building a house in Pune

00:43:46.414 --> 00:43:51.414
and we had to put a slab - very, very big slab

00:43:51.574 --> 00:43:55.614
needed about three hundred bags of cement for that.

00:43:55.774 --> 00:43:59.214
So I got the cement and I got the people,

00:43:59.374 --> 00:44:02.294
but they said, "You're to start early in the morning

00:44:02.454 --> 00:44:05.974
and you can finish next morning, twenty-four hours."

00:44:06.134 --> 00:44:11.054
I said, "All right." So at about five o'clock I told,

00:44:11.214 --> 00:44:13.454
"Let's go, the work is over."

00:44:13.614 --> 00:44:16.534
They said, "How do you know?" I said, "I know, let's go and see."

00:44:16.694 --> 00:44:20.574
So imagine, which was going to finish

00:44:20.734 --> 00:44:21.774
after twelve hours was already finished

00:44:21.934 --> 00:44:24.854
and all the workers were walking about.

00:44:25.014 --> 00:44:27.094
And everybody said, "Mother, it's a miracle.

00:44:27.254 --> 00:44:31.094
How can such a big slab be laid in such a short time?"

00:44:31.254 --> 00:44:33.774
I said, you see, to make them understand I said,

00:44:33.934 --> 00:44:36.854
"Must be Hanumana must have done the job."

00:44:37.014 --> 00:44:38.014
But all these people, all these deities

00:44:38.174 --> 00:44:42.334
are part and parcel of that Paramchaitanya.

00:44:42.494 --> 00:44:45.334
Now you are worshipping the Mother.

00:44:45.494 --> 00:44:48.534
To worship the Mother is the biggest thing because

00:44:48.654 --> 00:44:53.054
all these deities and everybody are Her children,

00:44:53.214 --> 00:44:56.214
under Her command, under Her desire.

00:44:56.374 --> 00:45:04.814
So to worship the Mother, the story of as you know about Ganesha,

00:45:04.974 --> 00:45:07.094
that the Mother said that

00:45:07.254 --> 00:45:10.254
"The one who goes round the Mother Earth three times,

00:45:10.414 --> 00:45:13.454
I will give Him a present."

00:45:13.614 --> 00:45:16.014
So Shri Ganesha thought in His wisdom,

00:45:16.174 --> 00:45:19.774
"Who is greater than My Mother? No one else."

00:45:19.934 --> 00:45:22.334
Because He knew He cannot compete with His brother

00:45:22.494 --> 00:45:30.774
who has got a peacock for a conveyance.

00:45:30.934 --> 00:45:38.494
So He said, "How can I go round and win over this person?"

00:45:38.654 --> 00:45:42.814
So best is to take to wisdom.

00:45:42.974 --> 00:45:47.534
"My Mother is greater than everything else."

00:45:47.654 --> 00:45:51.334
So He went around His Mother three times and He got the prize,

00:45:51.494 --> 00:45:54.894
and the other brother was just still moving on.

00:45:55.054 --> 00:45:59.254
When He came back He found that the present is already lost.

00:45:59.414 --> 00:46:05.574
So again and again I'll say it is the wisdom that helps you,

00:46:05.734 --> 00:46:09.894
the wisdom to leave everything to Paramchaitanya.

00:46:10.054 --> 00:46:12.654
And this is something,

00:46:12.814 --> 00:46:16.014
for a modern person, very difficult to understand.

00:46:16.174 --> 00:46:18.454
He can't calculate two plus two.

00:46:18.614 --> 00:46:23.334
He's so bad because of this computers and things like that,

00:46:23.494 --> 00:46:26.054
is absolutely hopeless

00:46:26.214 --> 00:46:34.294
as far as any mathematical calculations are needed or...

00:46:34.454 --> 00:46:36.734
Now I am, I must say,

00:46:36.894 --> 00:46:40.934
I don't know how to handle any computer or any calculator;

00:46:41.094 --> 00:46:45.534
but if you ask Me just like that, "Mother, how much will it be?"

00:46:45.694 --> 00:46:51.694
I'll say so much, and it will be that. It will be that.

00:46:51.854 --> 00:46:57.534
But I am so sure about it, it cannot be anything else but that,

00:46:57.694 --> 00:46:59.494
and it works that way.

00:46:59.654 --> 00:47:06.054
Sometimes of course, if I want to tell some wrong thing

00:47:06.214 --> 00:47:08.174
just to mislead the person

00:47:08.334 --> 00:47:12.494
then I may say something, but normally I know it is that.

00:47:12.654 --> 00:47:16.574
But I know not like the way we know;

00:47:16.734 --> 00:47:20.094
I just know it, that's what it is, just know it.

00:47:20.253 --> 00:47:27.773
So I am not saying that you develop your knowledge to that extent

00:47:27.934 --> 00:47:30.974
that you can do it, but your wisdom.

00:47:31.134 --> 00:47:35.054
If you start using your wisdom, it will always come handy.

00:47:35.214 --> 00:47:40.014
In anything that you do, think of the wisdom.

00:47:40.174 --> 00:47:44.374
My advice to you is

00:47:44.534 --> 00:47:50.694
that as your Mother loves the whole world, loves all of you,

00:47:50.854 --> 00:47:54.774
and cares for those who haven't even got realization,

00:47:54.934 --> 00:48:01.014
you should also strive to create more people for Sahaja Yoga.

00:48:01.174 --> 00:48:04.854
But in that if you start behaving in a manner all the time saying,

00:48:05.014 --> 00:48:08.854
"You are catching this, you are a bhoot, you are this, you are that."

00:48:09.014 --> 00:48:14.854
I never said that to anyone, so you shouldn't say like that.

00:48:15.014 --> 00:48:18.134
That's no love, that's no understanding.

00:48:18.294 --> 00:48:22.894
The understanding is that you were just the same as the person was

00:48:23.094 --> 00:48:25.094
and now you are knowledgeable,

00:48:25.254 --> 00:48:29.094
so you must use your knowledge to correct that person,

00:48:29.254 --> 00:48:32.454
not to put him down.

00:48:32.614 --> 00:48:35.854
And that correction is also not verbal;

00:48:36.014 --> 00:48:40.534
it's just through your vibrations you can correct the other person.

00:48:40.654 --> 00:48:45.094
Most of the Sahaja Yoga work sometimes I've seen that it stops

00:48:45.254 --> 00:48:49.614
because we are very methodical, we become like great teachers,

00:48:49.774 --> 00:48:55.374
we start telling them stories, and then they get fed up with you.

00:48:57.014 --> 00:49:00.174
So when you are handling other people, as I said,

00:49:00.334 --> 00:49:02.934
we have to spread the knowledge, very important,

00:49:03.094 --> 00:49:05.334
we cannot keep it to ourselves.

00:49:05.494 --> 00:49:09.134
But it's not for any ambition, for any leadership,

00:49:09.294 --> 00:49:11.014
for any kind of recognition;

00:49:11.174 --> 00:49:17.614
but just the use of our wisdom, use of our knowledge

00:49:17.774 --> 00:49:21.494
that we want to help others out of love.

00:49:21.654 --> 00:49:25.414
Not for any recognition, not for any position, nothing.

00:49:25.574 --> 00:49:28.694
Just we want to do it because we love them.

00:49:28.854 --> 00:49:34.534
And I am sure this will work out very effectively.

00:49:34.694 --> 00:49:38.694
And the person who will be helped, or the persons who will be helped

00:49:38.854 --> 00:49:42.094
will be just, be bound to you

00:49:42.254 --> 00:49:45.014
because they find the true knowledge.

00:49:45.174 --> 00:49:47.094
But supposing somebody comes to you and says

00:49:47.254 --> 00:49:49.094
"I know the true knowledge."

00:49:49.254 --> 00:49:56.174
You say, "You might be knowing, but I have to know what you know."

00:49:56.334 --> 00:50:00.374
Then you ask that person; then he'll give you a big lecture.

00:50:00.534 --> 00:50:02.454
You should say, "No, that's not the thing."

00:50:02.614 --> 00:50:05.014
Just smile. Say, "That's not the thing."

00:50:05.174 --> 00:50:12.814
The thing is, true knowledge is a part and parcel of your being.

00:50:13.934 --> 00:50:21.574
It's just within you. It is not some sort of a concrete stuff

00:50:21.734 --> 00:50:23.734
that you have read or you have understood,

00:50:23.894 --> 00:50:27.934
but it just has become a light within you,

00:50:28.094 --> 00:50:33.254
and that light is there. It has no ...

00:50:33.414 --> 00:50:37.174
it's no necessity for you to be very well educated,

00:50:37.334 --> 00:50:38.854
or to be very intelligent,

00:50:39.014 --> 00:50:42.214
or to be very highly placed, not necessary.

00:50:42.374 --> 00:50:48.094
It is how your heart is clean.

00:50:48.254 --> 00:50:50.334
In the heart it resides.

00:50:50.494 --> 00:50:53.254
Imagine, all other knowledge resides in the brain,

00:50:53.414 --> 00:50:57.774
while the pure knowledge resides in the heart. Very surprising.

00:50:57.934 --> 00:51:04.094
But we do not know also that actually our heart rules the head.

00:51:04.254 --> 00:51:09.974
There are seven auras around the heart which control the brain

00:51:10.134 --> 00:51:15.534
in such a manner that we act in the hands of the Paramchaitanya.

00:51:15.694 --> 00:51:18.774
Unless and until your heart is clean,

00:51:18.934 --> 00:51:24.174
unless and until in your heart you have a beautiful image

00:51:24.334 --> 00:51:34.894
of a person who is very, very pure,

00:51:35.054 --> 00:51:40.094
you cannot, you cannot do anything mentally.

00:51:40.254 --> 00:51:43.934
And from your heart if you have to do, your heart has to be

00:51:44.094 --> 00:51:47.934
very clean and extremely wise.

00:51:48.094 --> 00:51:53.494
This is the point one has to jump into: that your heart, is it wise?

00:51:53.654 --> 00:51:57.614
For example, to get attached to someone too much,

00:51:57.774 --> 00:52:02.174
identified with some much shows that your heart is not clean.

00:52:02.334 --> 00:52:05.494
It has so many bondages.

00:52:05.654 --> 00:52:08.894
Open your heart, fully.

00:52:09.054 --> 00:52:14.414
And that's why they say that the Goddess resides in the Heart,

00:52:14.574 --> 00:52:16.654
in the center Heart.

00:52:16.814 --> 00:52:21.774
She resides in the center Heart because She's so balanced.

00:52:21.934 --> 00:52:25.334
She resides in the center Heart as Shakti,

00:52:25.494 --> 00:52:30.654
and She gives you all that you want.

00:52:30.814 --> 00:52:34.494
Within you She's settled down as many things.

00:52:34.654 --> 00:52:36.614
You know the Shlokas which says

00:52:36.774 --> 00:52:42.414
that She's settled within us like knowledge,

00:52:42.574 --> 00:52:45.854
She's settled within us as memory,

00:52:46.014 --> 00:52:48.494
She is settled within us as sleep,

00:52:48.654 --> 00:52:54.574
also She's settled within us as illusion, bhranti.

00:52:54.734 --> 00:52:57.254
She's the one who puts us into illusions

00:52:57.414 --> 00:53:02.614
because we are not yet fully perfected.

00:53:02.774 --> 00:53:15.774
We have to become paripakwa - means absolutely, absolutely matured.

00:53:15.934 --> 00:53:20.694
Till we are matured this Mother Herself puts you into illusions

00:53:20.854 --> 00:53:24.774
and plays around, so that you learn how to be wise.

00:53:24.934 --> 00:53:27.974
So one should understand that She's playing around with you.

00:53:28.134 --> 00:53:31.054
And you should try to be very careful

00:53:31.214 --> 00:53:35.134
and not to be falling into Her maya,

00:53:35.294 --> 00:53:37.334
because if She puts you in the maya,

00:53:37.494 --> 00:53:40.974
you'll go round and round and you will reach nowhere.

00:53:41.134 --> 00:53:45.694
So this power of bhranti is also very important,

00:53:45.854 --> 00:53:50.814
this delusion you can call it, or else you can call it

00:53:50.974 --> 00:53:53.534
a thing by which She creates a drama,

00:53:53.694 --> 00:54:01.454
in which you become like a stupid man being found out.

00:54:01.614 --> 00:54:05.374
So this stupidity and all that

00:54:05.534 --> 00:54:10.694
can be removed by this bhranti that She creates.

00:54:10.854 --> 00:54:16.854
And this power of bhranti is because of human beings as they are,

00:54:17.014 --> 00:54:21.174
because they will not understand something straightforward;

00:54:21.334 --> 00:54:23.174
so it has to go round and round,

00:54:23.334 --> 00:54:24.934
till they reach a point to understand

00:54:25.094 --> 00:54:27.974
that it was the play of the Mother

00:54:28.134 --> 00:54:32.694
that brought them to this shore of wisdom.

00:54:32.854 --> 00:54:37.214
So for us it is important to see that

00:54:37.374 --> 00:54:41.774
so much has been done by Paramchaitanya for us,

00:54:41.934 --> 00:54:44.374
the Mother has done so much for us.

00:54:44.534 --> 00:54:48.534
Now what are we going to do ourselves

00:54:48.654 --> 00:54:52.174
to get all these powers that She has given us,

00:54:52.334 --> 00:54:55.894
to be completely enlightened and developed?

00:54:56.054 --> 00:54:58.334
What have we done so far?

00:54:58.494 --> 00:55:11.014
Nothing to be done as such but to develop a kind of a deep devotion,

00:55:11.174 --> 00:55:17.654
deep understanding; and that depth is possible, absolutely possible,

00:55:17.814 --> 00:55:22.934
because now you are on your way to that perfection.

00:55:23.094 --> 00:55:26.534
So today in Cabella is the last puja,

00:55:26.694 --> 00:55:30.054
and I want to tell you as a Mother

00:55:30.214 --> 00:55:34.654
that you all should depend on Paramchaitanya.

00:55:34.854 --> 00:55:38.814
That's very important, to depend on Paramchaitanya.

00:55:38.974 --> 00:55:42.254
Also there's a habit of many people

00:55:42.414 --> 00:55:44.534
to put the blame on others, like,

00:55:44.694 --> 00:55:49.054
"I got caught up from this person and got caught up from that person."

00:55:49.214 --> 00:55:56.894
You are caught up by yourself only. All such ideas are of no use.

00:55:57.054 --> 00:55:58.374
Face yourself,

00:55:58.534 --> 00:56:00.094
find out about yourself,

00:56:00.254 --> 00:56:03.974
and you have to perfect yourself. That's so important,

00:56:04.134 --> 00:56:07.054
because at this juncture of the time

00:56:07.214 --> 00:56:10.374
people think that something great is going to happen.

00:56:10.534 --> 00:56:12.094
I don't know.

00:56:12.254 --> 00:56:16.014
Two thousand years according to them would be something great,

00:56:16.174 --> 00:56:19.334
but I don't know, because is all man-made,

00:56:19.494 --> 00:56:23.174
all this two thousand year and three thousand year is man-made.

00:56:23.334 --> 00:56:29.294
But I Myself feel, as predicted by many, that possibly

00:56:29.454 --> 00:56:33.974
because of your understanding and your wisdom

00:56:34.134 --> 00:56:37.774
I'm sure something great may happen in this world,

00:56:37.934 --> 00:56:42.414
and things may be brought to a proper level

00:56:42.574 --> 00:56:44.974
of understanding of spirituality.

00:56:45.134 --> 00:56:48.774
Because this is the Last Judgment, and in this Last Judgment

00:56:48.934 --> 00:56:54.174
you have to play a very vital role, which I am sure you can do it,

00:56:54.334 --> 00:56:59.494
if you decide to achieve something for the future.

00:56:59.494 --> 00:57:02.454
May God bless you.
