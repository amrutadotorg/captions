00:14.340 --> 00:16.400
you

00:21.800 --> 00:33.340
I wonder if he understand the meaning of

00:26.539 --> 00:37.909
innocence or not innocence is a quality

00:33.340 --> 00:42.350
which is innate which is which cannot be

00:37.909 --> 00:47.269
forced which cannot be trained into it's

00:42.350 --> 00:53.449
just a quality innate quality within a

00:47.269 --> 00:57.559
human being maybe you say that innocent

00:53.449 --> 01:02.170
persons are attacked by the cunning by

00:57.559 --> 01:05.619
the accuracy but innocence is such a

01:02.170 --> 01:09.380
great thing that it cannot be distracted

01:05.619 --> 01:12.830
with the quality of the Spirit in a

01:09.380 --> 01:16.490
sense is the quality of the spirit and

01:12.830 --> 01:22.210
when they spirit within you is awakened

01:16.490 --> 01:26.509
you get the power of innocence by which

01:22.210 --> 01:31.039
you overcome all that is negative all

01:26.509 --> 01:35.649
that is wrong all that is detrimental to

01:31.039 --> 01:38.780
your growth spiritual understanding

01:35.649 --> 01:39.560
whatever is mine is not all means that's

01:38.780 --> 01:44.149
not so

01:39.560 --> 01:45.229
my body my head my everything my but I -

01:44.149 --> 01:49.819
give me the same I

01:45.229 --> 01:51.890
what is I then I is separated whatever

01:49.819 --> 01:55.190
is not mine is I so what remains it's

01:51.890 --> 01:56.780
your spirit somebody gave me this our

01:55.190 --> 02:00.349
limit as it is a very good argument to

01:56.780 --> 02:05.860
work it out and whatever remains is us

02:00.349 --> 02:08.599
and that I taste of our we have received

02:05.860 --> 02:11.270
so you are reducing all these miles

02:08.599 --> 02:13.610
miles miles so the fewer spirit of

02:11.270 --> 02:17.330
innocence we lack

02:13.610 --> 02:19.390
so the idea of a spirit terms of people

02:17.330 --> 02:21.620
think that if you become spiritual I

02:19.390 --> 02:22.770
mean I don't know what people think

02:21.620 --> 02:25.950
about

02:22.770 --> 02:27.930
with ten people but I about spiritual

02:25.950 --> 02:31.650
people is that you have to be something

02:27.930 --> 02:37.500
terrific like a fool or I don't know you

02:31.650 --> 02:41.220
have to be sharp like a fox you have to

02:37.500 --> 02:43.440
be lecture like Freud or something oh

02:41.220 --> 02:46.170
it's not so my desk beautifully

02:43.440 --> 02:51.330
no it is not spiritual person is just

02:46.170 --> 02:54.660
innocent just innocent there's no

02:51.330 --> 02:56.520
intelligence nothing just innocent the

02:54.660 --> 02:59.520
more thing is innocence see whatever he

02:56.520 --> 03:02.250
talks or says comes through innocence it

02:59.520 --> 03:04.650
doesn't have been clicked as such each

03:02.250 --> 03:07.890
year people are off with Rudy daily and

03:04.650 --> 03:13.910
to understanding and realizing nothing

03:07.890 --> 03:13.910
of the time it just has pure innocence

03:14.390 --> 03:25.650
it's so clean which is the way to become

03:20.190 --> 03:29.600
innocent in sahaja yoga we have a proper

03:25.650 --> 03:35.250
method how we can become innocent

03:29.600 --> 03:38.850
it happens through our thoughtless

03:35.250 --> 03:42.420
awareness if you are in the state of

03:38.850 --> 03:46.790
thoughtless awareness then what happens

03:42.420 --> 03:51.330
you do not react do not get involved

03:46.790 --> 03:53.190
into wrong things you do not get

03:51.330 --> 03:57.180
involved into any discussion as

03:53.190 --> 03:59.640
arguments but you just watch and the

03:57.180 --> 04:04.280
innocence within you Rises beautifully

03:59.640 --> 04:06.980
like a lotus rises out of a dirty pond

04:04.280 --> 04:08.940
so whatever may be the circumstances

04:06.980 --> 04:13.830
when you are in thoughtless awareness

04:08.940 --> 04:16.230
you do not react that is the sign of

04:13.830 --> 04:20.370
innocence and people who do not react

04:16.230 --> 04:24.210
keep young they will never show their

04:20.370 --> 04:25.930
age they keep young because to react is

04:24.210 --> 04:33.820
not

04:25.930 --> 04:37.780
a very good thing which makes you get

04:33.820 --> 04:41.680
involved into another person but if you

04:37.780 --> 04:43.900
don't react if you are just watching oh

04:41.680 --> 04:46.300
you're a witness then you don't get

04:43.900 --> 04:49.389
involved into anything you are away from

04:46.300 --> 04:55.240
it and that's how your innocence grooves

04:49.389 --> 05:02.349
and you get very confident I've read a

04:55.240 --> 05:08.770
story about a Chinese king who went to a

05:02.349 --> 05:13.870
saint and asked him that he wants some

05:08.770 --> 05:17.949
boon problems what he said I want my son

05:13.870 --> 05:21.520
to be developed into a person who can

05:17.949 --> 05:24.849
face all kinds of whatever people may do

05:21.520 --> 05:27.870
he should be able to face them soon all

05:24.849 --> 05:31.090
right we leave your son with me

05:27.870 --> 05:34.330
so when the argument started when the

05:31.090 --> 05:36.550
fighting started his son was just timing

05:34.330 --> 05:42.130
straight watching everything thoughtless

05:36.550 --> 05:46.840
of it so everybody from the arena went

05:42.130 --> 05:51.250
back they all went away and they

05:46.840 --> 05:54.550
couldn't stand the innocence of this boy

05:51.250 --> 05:58.240
who was very young and the king was

05:54.550 --> 06:00.659
surprised how his son could face all of

05:58.240 --> 06:04.659
them all their arguments all their

06:00.659 --> 06:07.449
aggression and all kinds of horrible

06:04.659 --> 06:12.580
things I said if anybody says anything

06:07.449 --> 06:14.530
to you you should just be innocent at

06:12.580 --> 06:19.449
that time you have power of innocence

06:14.530 --> 06:23.409
will show that this person who is trying

06:19.449 --> 06:27.039
to dominate you to trouble you is very

06:23.409 --> 06:29.050
much in the wrong I told you innocence

06:27.039 --> 06:33.220
is the spirit and spirit is the English

06:29.050 --> 06:37.780
which cannot be destroyed by the fact is

06:33.220 --> 06:40.389
that it cannot be destroyed by anything

06:37.780 --> 06:43.600
and it can be reestablished through

06:40.389 --> 06:46.120
sahaja yoga you might have been a very

06:43.600 --> 06:48.910
aggressive person you might have been a

06:46.120 --> 06:50.980
very unhappy person you must have been a

06:48.910 --> 06:54.520
person who is all the time disturbing

06:50.980 --> 06:57.040
others maybe but after sahaja yoga you

06:54.520 --> 06:59.980
can make your personality so sweet and

06:57.040 --> 07:05.410
beautiful that not only you can enjoy

06:59.980 --> 07:10.260
but others can also in this scene

07:05.410 --> 07:16.000
essence is something which is absolute

07:10.260 --> 07:24.280
Oreste intelligence it is not that it

07:16.000 --> 07:27.580
works for the purpose some purpose but

07:24.280 --> 07:31.330
this is purposeless it's absolutely

07:27.580 --> 07:34.510
purposeless and thus it achieves that

07:31.330 --> 07:38.740
height of joy because there is no

07:34.510 --> 07:42.450
purpose in anything it sees the futility

07:38.740 --> 07:45.760
of all kinds of endeavors that we have

07:42.450 --> 07:47.979
it just enjoy why people are running up

07:45.760 --> 07:50.950
and down why are they fighting this time

07:47.979 --> 07:53.950
suffer sees that why should they do it

07:50.950 --> 07:55.810
like that some may think they are all

07:53.950 --> 07:59.680
right there's nothing wrong with them

07:55.810 --> 08:03.940
but it's not so in a sense is something

07:59.680 --> 08:05.710
I told you is a innate quality and you

08:03.940 --> 08:10.120
should not deceive yourself by thinking

08:05.710 --> 08:12.669
you are innocent on the contrary you

08:10.120 --> 08:15.669
just put some introspection upon

08:12.669 --> 08:19.090
yourself and see for yourself what have

08:15.669 --> 08:23.140
you been doing so far as far as other

08:19.090 --> 08:26.460
servants what is your attitude see

08:23.140 --> 08:29.530
children how they are source of it

08:26.460 --> 08:32.469
anybody who comes on the stage and runs

08:29.530 --> 08:35.020
about how we enjoy why why do we enjoy a

08:32.469 --> 08:37.810
child running about we don't say he's

08:35.020 --> 08:40.870
gone amok or he's drunk but we enjoy the

08:37.810 --> 08:44.380
child why what is the sweetness of that

08:40.870 --> 08:46.350
child that makes us so happy because

08:44.380 --> 08:50.580
that's innocence

08:46.350 --> 08:53.730
his power is innocence at that power he

08:50.580 --> 08:57.930
is just looking so sweet so beautiful

08:53.730 --> 09:00.480
that it gives us the real joy within so

08:57.930 --> 09:05.520
the second thing is that innocence is

09:00.480 --> 09:06.540
jointly innocence gives joy to people

09:05.520 --> 09:10.170
anything

09:06.540 --> 09:13.470
sets innocently anything done innocently

09:10.170 --> 09:18.270
is very very joy-giving

09:13.470 --> 09:23.640
and in that you you see the person so

09:18.270 --> 09:29.390
transparent so beautiful that you enjoy

09:23.640 --> 09:32.220
that transparency and that sanctified

09:29.390 --> 09:35.220
innocence if you want to have real joy

09:32.220 --> 09:36.810
then have innocent love between yourself

09:35.220 --> 09:40.550
and enjoy it

09:36.810 --> 09:40.550
may God thank

09:53.030 --> 09:55.090
