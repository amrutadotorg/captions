00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.400
you

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:33.340
I wonder if he understand the meaning of

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:37.909
innocence or not innocence is a quality

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:42.350
which is innate which is which cannot be

00:00:37.909 --> 00:00:47.269
forced which cannot be trained into it's

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:53.449
just a quality innate quality within a

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:57.559
human being maybe you say that innocent

00:00:53.449 --> 00:01:02.170
persons are attacked by the cunning by

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:05.619
the accuracy but innocence is such a

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:09.380
great thing that it cannot be distracted

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:12.830
with the quality of the Spirit in a

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:16.490
sense is the quality of the spirit and

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:22.210
when they spirit within you is awakened

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:26.509
you get the power of innocence by which

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:31.039
you overcome all that is negative all

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:35.649
that is wrong all that is detrimental to

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:38.780
your growth spiritual understanding

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:39.560
whatever is mine is not all means that's

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:44.149
not so

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:45.229
my body my head my everything my but I -

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:49.819
give me the same I

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:51.890
what is I then I is separated whatever

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:55.190
is not mine is I so what remains it's

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.780
your spirit somebody gave me this our

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:00.349
limit as it is a very good argument to

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:05.860
work it out and whatever remains is us

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:08.599
and that I taste of our we have received

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:11.270
so you are reducing all these miles

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:13.610
miles miles so the fewer spirit of

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:17.330
innocence we lack

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:19.390
so the idea of a spirit terms of people

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.620
think that if you become spiritual I

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.770
mean I don't know what people think

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.950
about

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:27.930
with ten people but I about spiritual

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.650
people is that you have to be something

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:37.500
terrific like a fool or I don't know you

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:41.220
have to be sharp like a fox you have to

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:43.440
be lecture like Freud or something oh

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.170
it's not so my desk beautifully

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:51.330
no it is not spiritual person is just

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:54.660
innocent just innocent there's no

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:56.520
intelligence nothing just innocent the

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.520
more thing is innocence see whatever he

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:02.250
talks or says comes through innocence it

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:04.650
doesn't have been clicked as such each

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:07.890
year people are off with Rudy daily and

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:13.910
to understanding and realizing nothing

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:13.910
of the time it just has pure innocence

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:25.650
it's so clean which is the way to become

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:29.600
innocent in sahaja yoga we have a proper

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:35.250
method how we can become innocent

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:38.850
it happens through our thoughtless

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:42.420
awareness if you are in the state of

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:46.790
thoughtless awareness then what happens

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:51.330
you do not react do not get involved

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:53.190
into wrong things you do not get

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:57.180
involved into any discussion as

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:59.640
arguments but you just watch and the

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:04.280
innocence within you Rises beautifully

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:06.980
like a lotus rises out of a dirty pond

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.940
so whatever may be the circumstances

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:13.830
when you are in thoughtless awareness

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:16.230
you do not react that is the sign of

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:20.370
innocence and people who do not react

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:24.210
keep young they will never show their

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:25.930
age they keep young because to react is

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:33.820
not

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:37.780
a very good thing which makes you get

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:41.680
involved into another person but if you

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:43.900
don't react if you are just watching oh

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.300
you're a witness then you don't get

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:49.389
involved into anything you are away from

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:55.240
it and that's how your innocence grooves

00:04:49.389 --> 00:05:02.349
and you get very confident I've read a

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:08.770
story about a Chinese king who went to a

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:13.870
saint and asked him that he wants some

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:17.949
boon problems what he said I want my son

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:21.520
to be developed into a person who can

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:24.849
face all kinds of whatever people may do

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:27.870
he should be able to face them soon all

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:31.090
right we leave your son with me

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:34.330
so when the argument started when the

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:36.550
fighting started his son was just timing

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:42.130
straight watching everything thoughtless

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:46.840
of it so everybody from the arena went

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:51.250
back they all went away and they

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:54.550
couldn't stand the innocence of this boy

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:58.240
who was very young and the king was

00:05:54.550 --> 00:06:00.659
surprised how his son could face all of

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:04.659
them all their arguments all their

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:07.449
aggression and all kinds of horrible

00:06:04.659 --> 00:06:12.580
things I said if anybody says anything

00:06:07.449 --> 00:06:14.530
to you you should just be innocent at

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:19.449
that time you have power of innocence

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:23.409
will show that this person who is trying

00:06:19.449 --> 00:06:27.039
to dominate you to trouble you is very

00:06:23.409 --> 00:06:29.050
much in the wrong I told you innocence

00:06:27.039 --> 00:06:33.220
is the spirit and spirit is the English

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:37.780
which cannot be destroyed by the fact is

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:40.389
that it cannot be destroyed by anything

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:43.600
and it can be reestablished through

00:06:40.389 --> 00:06:46.120
sahaja yoga you might have been a very

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:48.910
aggressive person you might have been a

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:50.980
very unhappy person you must have been a

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:54.520
person who is all the time disturbing

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:57.040
others maybe but after sahaja yoga you

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:59.980
can make your personality so sweet and

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:05.410
beautiful that not only you can enjoy

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:10.260
but others can also in this scene

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:16.000
essence is something which is absolute

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:24.280
Oreste intelligence it is not that it

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:27.580
works for the purpose some purpose but

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:31.330
this is purposeless it's absolutely

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:34.510
purposeless and thus it achieves that

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:38.740
height of joy because there is no

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:42.450
purpose in anything it sees the futility

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:45.760
of all kinds of endeavors that we have

00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:47.979
it just enjoy why people are running up

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:50.950
and down why are they fighting this time

00:07:47.979 --> 00:07:53.950
suffer sees that why should they do it

00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:55.810
like that some may think they are all

00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:59.680
right there's nothing wrong with them

00:07:55.810 --> 00:08:03.940
but it's not so in a sense is something

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:05.710
I told you is a innate quality and you

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:10.120
should not deceive yourself by thinking

00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:12.669
you are innocent on the contrary you

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:15.669
just put some introspection upon

00:08:12.669 --> 00:08:19.090
yourself and see for yourself what have

00:08:15.669 --> 00:08:23.140
you been doing so far as far as other

00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:26.460
servants what is your attitude see

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:29.530
children how they are source of it

00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:32.469
anybody who comes on the stage and runs

00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:35.020
about how we enjoy why why do we enjoy a

00:08:32.469 --> 00:08:37.810
child running about we don't say he's

00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:40.870
gone amok or he's drunk but we enjoy the

00:08:37.810 --> 00:08:44.380
child why what is the sweetness of that

00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:46.350
child that makes us so happy because

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:50.580
that's innocence

00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:53.730
his power is innocence at that power he

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:57.930
is just looking so sweet so beautiful

00:08:53.730 --> 00:09:00.480
that it gives us the real joy within so

00:08:57.930 --> 00:09:05.520
the second thing is that innocence is

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:06.540
jointly innocence gives joy to people

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:10.170
anything

00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:13.470
sets innocently anything done innocently

00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:18.270
is very very joy-giving

00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:23.640
and in that you you see the person so

00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:29.390
transparent so beautiful that you enjoy

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:32.220
that transparency and that sanctified

00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:35.220
innocence if you want to have real joy

00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:36.810
then have innocent love between yourself

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:40.550
and enjoy it

00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:40.550
may God thank

00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:55.090
you
