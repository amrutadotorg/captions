WEBVTT

00:01.834 --> 00:04.808
Today we have decided

00:04.968 --> 00:09.801
to have a puja of Virata

00:11.968 --> 00:15.067
in the land of Shri Krishna.

00:16.434 --> 00:19.667
As you know, in the growth

00:19.868 --> 00:23.641
of Shri Vishnu's manifestation,

00:23.801 --> 00:28.901
He comes into ten incarnations

00:29.868 --> 00:35.968
and ultimately He manifests Himself as Virat.

00:36.501 --> 55:17.280
Virat is the brain of the being

00:49.367 --> 00:53.534
which can call as God Almighty,

00:53.701 --> 00:57.708
so the whole central nervous system is worked through

00:57.868 --> 01:06.234
by Shri Krishna as Vishnu,

01:06.400 --> 01:09.474
then all this incarnations,

01:09.634 --> 01:15.267
then Shri Krishna and ultimately as Virat.

01:15.534 --> 01:19.968
This is the development of our brain

01:20.868 --> 01:24.374
and when we are worshipping Virat,

01:24.534 --> 01:29.808
we have to know that within us also we have got

01:29.968 --> 01:35.708
the manifestation of this power of Virat.

01:35.868 --> 01:39.641
That manifestation which we have

01:39.801 --> 01:47.801
we can call it as Virat if Shri Krishna is Mahavirata.

01:47.968 --> 01:50.107
You all know about Virat

01:50.267 --> 01:53.873
much more than I can tell you today

01:54.033 --> 01:58.701
because It's the whole,

01:59.267 --> 02:02.200
It's the totality.

02:03.367 --> 02:10.607
And the totality of everything, if that is Virat,

02:10.767 --> 02:13.907
then that is in your brain,

02:14.067 --> 02:19.167
but reality is in your heart.

02:20.267 --> 02:24.274
So the totality you may see,

02:24.434 --> 02:26.674
you may witness,

02:26.834 --> 02:32.274
the reality is the subtlety behind it.

02:32.434 --> 02:35.574
So the brain which is not ruled by the heart,

02:35.734 --> 02:38.240
which is not nourished by the heart,

02:38.400 --> 02:40.774
is a very dangerous thing,

02:40.934 --> 02:44.207
because it creates extroversion,

02:44.367 --> 02:49.973
and such a person who is without any heart

02:50.133 --> 02:55.741
tries to do things, becomes very ruthless

02:55.901 --> 02:58.240
and can be very dangerous.

02:58.400 --> 03:02.634
It could the other way also within us;

03:03.000 --> 03:06.574
that if we allow our heart to rule us,

03:06.734 --> 03:08.873
only live with our emotions

03:09.033 --> 03:11.240
and not to use our rationality,

03:11.400 --> 03:17.007
then we can become really very dangerous people to ourselves.

03:17.167 --> 03:20.341
In the sense, we become lethargic,

03:20.501 --> 03:25.774
we become indulgent into wrong sort of things.

03:25.934 --> 03:29.567
And today what one feels that in America

03:29.734 --> 03:31.040
there's more dominance

03:31.200 --> 03:34.767
of the left side than of the right.

03:36.934 --> 03:39.940
Right side is our attention

03:40.100 --> 03:42.808
and the right side of attention is we can say

03:42.968 --> 03:46.973
is the liver of God Almighty.

03:47.133 --> 03:49.541
So now when we have to talk of the totality,

03:49.701 --> 03:52.240
when we are part and parcel of the totality

03:52.400 --> 03:57.441
and now we are awakened to that existence of ours

03:57.601 --> 04:00.808
as the part and parcel of the whole,

04:00.968 --> 04:03.174
then we have to realize to become the whole

04:03.334 --> 04:05.674
we have to do something about it.

04:05.834 --> 04:08.407
Specially in the land of Shri Krishna

04:08.567 --> 04:11.607
we have to work out this tremendous task

04:11.767 --> 04:16.200
of creating Viratas out of Sahaja Yogis.

04:17.601 --> 04:21.873
After going through the various experiences

04:22.033 --> 04:25.140
of American Sahaja Yoga,

04:25.300 --> 04:26.808
I've reached a conclusion

04:26.968 --> 04:30.507
that we have to talk more frankly about things

04:30.667 --> 04:32.774
than we have been talking before.

04:32.934 --> 04:37.441
Why there's such a failure of Sahaja Yoga in this great country

04:37.601 --> 04:41.968
while there are so many seekers.

04:43.033 --> 04:48.507
The main point is that we do not realize

04:48.667 --> 04:55.167
that the left side is overpowering this country very much.

04:55.767 --> 05:01.067
There are people who are active,

05:02.968 --> 05:07.641
but the percentage is very low

05:07.801 --> 05:10.207
because of too much of affluence,

05:10.367 --> 05:12.641
too much of freedom,

05:12.801 --> 05:17.607
the idea of "what's wrong in anything."

05:17.767 --> 05:22.040
People are going towards shamelessness,

05:22.200 --> 05:27.474
immoral life, self-indulgent.

05:27.634 --> 05:31.674
And this self-indulgence, to protect that,

05:31.834 --> 05:35.808
people always develop a kind of a ego

05:35.968 --> 05:40.868
which has no dynamism in it.

05:43.100 --> 05:47.107
So now the problem lies with Sahaja Yogis,

05:47.267 --> 05:49.274
not with Sahaja Yoga as such.

05:49.434 --> 05:53.007
When you see that the land is not so fertile

05:53.167 --> 05:55.808
and here you have to work very hard,

05:55.968 --> 05:59.140
the responsibility of all the Sahaja Yogis in America

05:59.300 --> 06:01.374
is to go deep.

06:01.534 --> 06:06.541
You can see wherever the land is not fertile

06:06.701 --> 06:09.474
the trees go very deep down,

06:09.634 --> 06:16.274
they dig very deep into the Mother Earth

06:16.434 --> 06:19.940
for the sap to be sucked in.

06:20.100 --> 06:23.741
And the same way they grow very high,

06:23.901 --> 06:29.968
because the strength of their deepening

06:30.133 --> 06:32.374
gives them this great height.

06:32.534 --> 06:34.474
So they grow very tall

06:34.634 --> 06:36.641
and also they are very deep.

06:36.801 --> 06:39.907
In the same way the Sahaja Yogis of America

06:40.067 --> 06:41.474
have to work out

06:41.634 --> 06:44.307
because here it's so much superficiality

06:44.467 --> 06:46.741
and so much of frivolousness

06:46.901 --> 06:51.107
and also no meaning to their lives.

06:51.267 --> 06:53.107
They have no meanings at all

06:53.267 --> 06:57.007
and they are just frittering away their lives

06:57.167 --> 06:59.808
with all nonsensical ideas about their emotions

06:59.968 --> 07:02.507
and their love and all those things.

07:02.667 --> 07:06.607
So what we need today are Sahaja Yogis who are right-sided,

07:06.767 --> 07:09.940
those who will produce results,

07:10.100 --> 07:11.808
those who will be dynamic.

07:11.968 --> 07:15.374
They don't have to worry that somebody is right-sided

07:15.534 --> 07:17.040
and he'll become right-sided,

07:17.200 --> 07:19.341
actually that is what is needed today.

07:19.501 --> 07:22.741
Unless and until you have people who are dynamic

07:22.901 --> 07:24.907
we cannot work it out.

07:25.067 --> 07:27.934
It's a reaction in this country as well as in England,

07:28.167 --> 07:30.808
in many countries who dominated other people.

07:30.968 --> 07:33.574
Like you see in this place

07:33.734 --> 07:36.574
which was actually originally belonged

07:36.734 --> 07:43.307
to some tribes of Indians

07:43.467 --> 07:47.708
and the English, the Spanish and all these Europeans came,

07:47.868 --> 07:49.708
killed them and occupied here.

07:49.868 --> 07:50.973
It's a highway robbery,

07:51.133 --> 07:52.873
absolutely highway robbery.

07:53.033 --> 07:59.240
Because of their arrogance and their aggressiveness,

07:59.400 --> 08:02.274
they could not see that they were doing such a horrible thing.

08:02.434 --> 08:05.507
I mean, why call any names of Hitler,

08:05.667 --> 08:07.708
they're even worse than Hitler,

08:07.868 --> 08:10.240
because at least Hitler was taken to task,

08:10.400 --> 08:13.774
he was condemned and people know that it was a mistake.

08:13.934 --> 08:16.708
But what about those who came all the way from there

08:16.868 --> 08:19.374
and killed so many people here

08:19.534 --> 08:23.341
and nicely having a very nice time everywhere

08:23.501 --> 08:24.708
as great Americans

08:24.868 --> 08:28.868
and now they are trying to show off everywhere.

08:29.200 --> 08:32.507
Actually it's such a sinful thing that is done

08:32.667 --> 08:34.774
that all these souls which have died

08:34.934 --> 08:36.774
I think have possessed them

08:36.934 --> 08:41.334
and now today America is on the left hand side.

08:41.534 --> 08:46.407
The right hand side of Americans is finished now,

08:46.567 --> 08:49.641
they are on the left hand side, guilty,

08:49.801 --> 08:52.641
feeling guilty they are taking to indulgences.

08:52.801 --> 08:54.708
Once you go to the right side, you see,

08:54.868 --> 08:56.374
you are very disciplined

08:56.534 --> 09:01.341
and you become very ascetic by temperament,

09:01.501 --> 09:06.240
I should say, and you want to dominate others

09:06.400 --> 09:08.040
and you want to capture.

09:08.200 --> 09:13.107
But today the situation of England and America is just the same.

09:13.267 --> 09:15.708
In England the same thing I find with Sahaja Yogis

09:15.868 --> 09:17.973
they are just lovey-dovey types, you see,

09:18.133 --> 09:23.708
and all they love Me and love Me and love Me.

09:23.868 --> 09:26.474
And I just don't understand.

09:26.634 --> 09:27.708
What's this going on?

09:27.868 --> 09:29.307
They all love Me

09:29.467 --> 09:31.708
and they'll bring flowers for Me, finished.

09:31.868 --> 09:34.274
Is this the way we are going to work our Sahaja Yoga

09:34.434 --> 09:37.741
in that England and in this America?

09:37.901 --> 09:42.501
"Mother, I love you very much." So what?

09:45.234 --> 09:49.674
So to become one part and parcel of the whole,

09:49.834 --> 09:52.541
a drop has to become the ocean,

09:52.701 --> 09:55.107
you have to become great people,

09:55.267 --> 09:58.374
you have to be responsible.

09:58.534 --> 10:01.140
And this lovey-dovey business that you have

10:01.300 --> 10:03.641
has to go out of your mind completely,

10:03.801 --> 10:07.074
otherwise Sahaja Yoga cannot work out in these two countries

10:07.234 --> 10:11.868
and you'll be cursed one after another.

10:12.534 --> 10:14.240
There are shocks after shocks

10:14.400 --> 10:18.907
that are coming to this country as well as to England.

10:19.067 --> 10:22.140
But people are not learning any lessons from that,

10:22.300 --> 10:24.641
still it is all right;

10:24.801 --> 10:27.107
we get this disease, all right;

10:27.267 --> 10:28.840
then we glorify it.

10:29.000 --> 10:33.200
If we are suffering from ecological difference,

10:33.400 --> 10:34.708
still we are glorified.

10:34.868 --> 10:37.674
If you are using too much of machinery out of balance,

10:37.834 --> 10:39.240
still we are glorified.

10:39.400 --> 10:43.574
Because they just want self-indulgence.

10:43.734 --> 10:46.601
Just for self-indulgence they don't want to see the point

10:46.767 --> 10:50.341
that what is going wrong with this country is that,

10:50.501 --> 10:55.701
that they do not see anything that is reality.

10:55.901 --> 10:58.574
And the reality, though it is in the heart,

10:58.734 --> 11:03.901
though it works in the heart, it has to act.

11:06.667 --> 11:10.341
This has to act and if it does not act,

11:10.501 --> 11:12.741
this kind of a passive behavior

11:12.901 --> 11:14.374
is not going to help you.

11:14.534 --> 11:16.174
Now at this old age of Mine

11:16.334 --> 11:18.973
I'm traveling from places to places

11:19.133 --> 11:20.808
and I'm doing so much.

11:20.968 --> 11:26.067
Now let us think about it: what have we done for Sahaja Yoga?

11:27.968 --> 11:30.541
Those who see you,

11:30.701 --> 11:35.973
see you as sometimes as just some hippies with disheveled hairs

11:36.133 --> 11:38.641
and something that kind of a thing.

11:38.801 --> 11:40.441
This is the report I have,

11:40.601 --> 11:43.140
from people who came to your centers and things like that.

11:43.300 --> 11:46.207
"Oh, they are a set of hippies, you see," just like that.

11:46.367 --> 11:48.541
So the first thing a Sahaja Yogi has to do,

11:48.701 --> 11:51.107
has to make up something of his personality,

11:51.267 --> 11:54.901
in America is very important.

11:55.067 --> 11:57.934
They are studying, they are out of job,

11:58.133 --> 11:59.808
they are doing this, that.

11:59.968 --> 12:03.307
That sort of people are not going to help Sahaja Yoga at all,

12:03.467 --> 12:05.374
they'll be liabilities on Sahaja Yoga.

12:05.534 --> 12:09.374
If you really want to do something you have to become something.

12:09.534 --> 12:11.474
You have to study, you have to become something,

12:11.634 --> 12:15.741
you have to have some sort of a degree, diploma, something

12:15.901 --> 12:18.541
attached to you, you have to mean something.

12:18.701 --> 12:21.873
Hippies cannot run Sahaja Yoga in America;

12:22.033 --> 12:29.307
they may run better in India but not here.

12:29.467 --> 12:31.741
So one has to realize that

12:31.901 --> 12:33.973
what has gone wrong with us is that

12:34.133 --> 12:38.207
we are now following a very subtle way

12:38.367 --> 12:43.541
of the same trends that we have taken.

12:43.701 --> 13:02.708
After Realization, we think that we are realized souls,

13:02.868 --> 13:04.840
that we have become yogis now,

13:05.000 --> 13:08.634
that we are realized souls.

13:08.934 --> 13:12.267
But one should see

13:12.434 --> 13:15.541
that we have become realized souls, no doubt,

13:15.701 --> 13:20.873
but whatever bindings we had before coming to Sahaja Yoga

13:21.033 --> 13:25.100
have become subtler.

13:27.067 --> 13:35.407
They have not expressed themselves as lights,

13:35.567 --> 13:40.234
just we believe that we are Sahaja Yogis.

13:41.033 --> 13:44.701
We believe that we have vibrations

13:45.133 --> 13:48.474
and also we can feel the vibrations.

13:48.634 --> 13:52.040
But still we have not reached that state

13:52.200 --> 13:57.367
where we have become the totality.

13:57.534 --> 14:00.441
We have to still grow.

14:00.601 --> 14:03.708
And if you are settled down with your vibrations

14:03.868 --> 14:05.907
and thinking that you are all right,

14:06.067 --> 14:08.774
you are sadly mistaken.

14:08.934 --> 14:13.140
Whatever were our conditionings before coming to Sahaja Yoga,

14:13.300 --> 14:16.907
say you were a hippie,

14:17.067 --> 14:19.873
so the enlightenment has come,

14:20.033 --> 14:24.868
but then the idea of this love business is there.

14:25.234 --> 14:27.607
Supposing you were a business man,

14:27.767 --> 14:30.107
so the enlightenment has come to you

14:30.267 --> 14:33.907
and you think that Mother should help you in your business,

14:34.067 --> 14:36.174
that's what it is.

14:36.334 --> 14:38.774
Supposing now if you were unmarried

14:38.934 --> 14:40.574
and you are married in Sahaja Yoga,

14:40.734 --> 14:43.374
then you want that your marriage should be successful

14:43.534 --> 14:46.534
in Sahaja Yoga.

14:47.968 --> 14:52.873
If there has been a problem in your health or something like that,

14:53.033 --> 14:56.240
then you have become a subtler person that you think,

14:56.400 --> 15:00.534
"I asked help from Mother for that."

15:01.434 --> 15:07.200
But we do not think that what have we contributed to Sahaja Yoga.

15:09.033 --> 15:12.868
We had certain things

15:14.501 --> 15:18.240
which we thought were wrong - maybe that,

15:18.400 --> 15:21.940
but in Sahaja Yoga we do not see those things are with us,

15:22.100 --> 15:24.374
still continuing with us.

15:24.534 --> 15:28.840
To become Virata we have to really examine ourselves,

15:29.000 --> 15:33.407
without any anger, malice or anything, but see for ourselves.

15:33.567 --> 15:37.107
I know people who are small-minded,

15:37.267 --> 15:42.107
who have jealousies and their jealousies continue.

15:42.267 --> 15:45.474
Supposing there's a good musician,

15:45.634 --> 15:49.968
they'll not appreciate if the other person is a musician,

15:50.868 --> 15:52.507
he will not appreciate,

15:52.667 --> 15:55.441
he will not encourage that person that,

15:55.601 --> 16:01.400
"Really I am a musician, he's also a musician, let me help him."

16:02.033 --> 16:06.574
So the small-mindedness that existed before

16:06.734 --> 16:10.040
still becomes in a glorified way.

16:10.200 --> 16:11.708
The person will think that

16:11.868 --> 16:15.040
"All right, I am a musician and I sing very well

16:15.200 --> 16:17.708
and I am singing Mother's praise."

16:17.868 --> 16:21.801
But anybody else who's singing

16:21.968 --> 16:24.441
will not be appreciated

16:24.601 --> 16:27.240
to that extent as you should expect

16:27.400 --> 16:33.334
that you are a part and parcel of the whole.

16:34.734 --> 16:36.840
This hand, if it feels hurt,

16:37.000 --> 16:42.167
the another hand immediately helps it.

16:45.868 --> 16:51.140
In the whole body you see the system is so totally connected.

16:51.300 --> 16:57.300
As soon as you eat food, the digestive system starts working.

16:57.501 --> 16:59.574
But we should watch ourselves.

16:59.734 --> 17:01.040
If you have to become deeper,

17:01.200 --> 17:03.907
we have to watch ourselves where are we lacking.

17:04.067 --> 17:05.708
Now how does a tree grow?

17:05.868 --> 17:07.074
I have told you many times the story

17:07.234 --> 17:10.207
that there's a little cell at the end of the root

17:10.367 --> 17:12.274
and it knows,

17:12.434 --> 17:16.400
and it knows one purpose: that it has to become a tree,

17:16.701 --> 17:17.808
so it goes round.

17:17.968 --> 17:21.407
It sees a boulder or something, stone, goes round it,

17:21.567 --> 17:22.940
doesn't fight it.

17:23.100 --> 17:27.240
Because ultimately what we have to achieve

17:27.400 --> 17:29.934
is to become the tree,

17:30.100 --> 17:33.033
so we have to keep that in view,

17:33.234 --> 17:35.901
that we have to become the tree

17:36.133 --> 17:39.840
and not some sort of a small little frog here and there

17:40.000 --> 17:41.341
croaking about Sahaja Yoga.

17:41.501 --> 17:45.801
No, that's not going to work out!

17:46.868 --> 17:48.741
And this is what I find

17:48.901 --> 17:55.007
also very true about people in, say, England, same thing.

17:55.167 --> 17:56.240
The leaders are fighting,

17:56.400 --> 17:59.307
the leaders are trying to find out ways and methods

17:59.467 --> 18:02.107
how to improve the quality of Sahaja Yogis,

18:02.267 --> 18:03.641
but it's the Sahaja Yogis

18:03.801 --> 18:06.507
who have to know that the responsibility is theirs.

18:06.667 --> 18:13.074
They have to grow, they have to become Viratas.

18:13.234 --> 18:14.708
And this is America

18:14.868 --> 18:17.774
where I told you is the place of Shri Krishna,

18:17.934 --> 18:21.801
where Shri Krishna became the Virat.

18:22.534 --> 18:28.973
Unless and until you see for yourself

18:29.133 --> 18:34.307
that we have to do this, we have to become this,

18:34.467 --> 18:38.968
you are still busy with our little, little silly problems.

18:39.200 --> 18:40.607
It's a vicious circle,

18:40.767 --> 18:43.973
as soon as you start worrying about your silly problems

18:44.133 --> 18:49.174
and your old stuffs still becoming glorified in Sahaja Yoga,

18:49.334 --> 18:55.167
then you find the vicious circle starts working,

18:55.934 --> 18:59.574
it doesn't achieve anything,

18:59.734 --> 19:02.174
it doesn't give you good chances,

19:02.334 --> 19:06.407
it doesn't give you confidence.

19:06.567 --> 19:11.601
It's such a thing, it's like a packaging as they call it.

19:11.834 --> 19:16.274
But as soon as you decide, "No, I am going to do it,"

19:16.434 --> 19:18.307
you people are Sahaja Yogis,

19:18.467 --> 19:21.507
you know all about Kundalini,

19:21.667 --> 19:23.940
you know all about awakening,

19:24.100 --> 19:29.341
you know all about higher stages of attainment,

19:29.501 --> 19:34.774
you all, everyone is capable of giving Realization to people.

19:34.934 --> 19:38.040
You know where the thing is stuck,

19:38.200 --> 19:44.007
everything you know, but now just think about it,

19:44.167 --> 19:52.240
how many of you have been able to do something about it?

19:52.400 --> 19:58.074
When people see you their idea about you is very poor.

19:58.234 --> 20:02.873
They think that you are stuck up with your wives,

20:03.033 --> 20:05.407
so the wife is very dominating,

20:05.567 --> 20:07.507
so this is happening.

20:07.667 --> 20:09.907
Suddenly you go off,

20:10.067 --> 20:12.341
you see your child, worried about this one, you ...

20:12.501 --> 20:16.574
Sometimes I am surprised that once they are married,

20:16.734 --> 20:17.808
they have a child,

20:17.968 --> 20:22.040
then they become nothing but the parents of the child, finished,

20:22.200 --> 20:24.240
Sahaja Yoga is finished.

20:24.400 --> 20:26.868
Then the child becomes important.

20:27.033 --> 20:31.934
The blessings become the bindings.

20:34.067 --> 20:38.040
So you have to watch within yourself

20:38.200 --> 20:42.367
that we are here for liberation, for complete freedom.

20:42.534 --> 20:44.240
But in the subtle way

20:44.400 --> 20:47.040
all these things go on binding

20:47.200 --> 20:48.973
you and you are attached to it

20:49.133 --> 20:52.940
and you don't know how they are still tagging you down,

20:53.100 --> 20:54.708
don't allow you to fly,

20:54.868 --> 20:56.207
they don't give you the freedom

20:56.367 --> 21:01.033
that is your own right to have it.

21:01.200 --> 21:03.808
So even if I make a aeroplane,

21:03.968 --> 21:06.407
I do everything, put the fuel into it,

21:06.567 --> 21:11.973
I say everything, but doesn't want to fly.

21:12.133 --> 21:14.074
Now what do you do with such an aeroplane

21:14.234 --> 21:17.033
which doesn't want to fly?

21:17.734 --> 21:20.808
This sort of a situation is there

21:20.968 --> 21:24.274
and this situation makes you so limited

21:24.434 --> 21:28.973
and so dwarfy. How will you grow?

21:29.133 --> 21:33.374
Unless and until you grow and you show that

21:33.534 --> 21:35.040
in your day to day life

21:35.200 --> 21:37.708
into your personality, into everything,

21:37.868 --> 21:41.074
I assure you nobody is going to be impressed by you.

21:41.234 --> 21:46.474
Sahaja Yoga is not going to work by advertisement,

21:46.634 --> 21:48.574
nor by My photographs,

21:48.734 --> 21:53.174
it's going to work by your work, by your responsibility,

21:53.334 --> 21:55.541
by your shouldering Sahaja Yoga,

21:55.701 --> 22:00.507
it's your responsibility to spread Sahaja Yoga and to establish it.

22:00.667 --> 22:04.007
But first of all your shoulders should be strong.

22:04.167 --> 22:06.274
You are still out of job,

22:06.434 --> 22:09.940
you are still something, somebody hanging in the air,

22:10.100 --> 22:13.708
you are still somebody who'll not even look at you.

22:13.868 --> 22:18.300
Then how can you carry on your shoulders?

22:20.367 --> 22:24.674
So first thing is to build yourself inside

22:24.834 --> 22:26.641
as well as outside,

22:26.801 --> 22:28.507
but such a vicious circle I tell you.

22:28.667 --> 22:30.708
If you do not go deep into yourself,

22:30.868 --> 22:33.441
you cannot also get the outside thing,

22:33.601 --> 22:35.274
so it works hand in hand,

22:35.434 --> 22:37.808
as soon as you start building yourself inside,

22:37.968 --> 22:41.074
you'll be amazed how things will work out,

22:41.234 --> 22:44.441
how you'll become dynamic, how you'll become great.

22:44.601 --> 22:46.374
But you get involved into things

22:46.534 --> 22:50.207
which are very small and transitory.

22:50.367 --> 22:54.341
So as I told you before, we are seeking the eternal.

22:54.501 --> 22:57.307
So the transitory things are to be only used

22:57.467 --> 23:01.834
very temporarily, what we need is not so important.

23:02.734 --> 23:06.207
If you can understand this thing clearly,

23:06.367 --> 23:12.307
that we still are not free, not detached

23:12.467 --> 23:18.140
from all the things we had before Sahaja Yoga

23:18.300 --> 23:21.040
and they have become subtler and subtler and subtler.

23:21.200 --> 23:26.307
We are still only using Sahaja Yoga for that purpose

23:26.467 --> 23:30.734
and not for spreading the light.

23:35.534 --> 23:38.601
So what's going to happen?

23:42.701 --> 23:45.334
This is absolutely,

23:45.534 --> 23:50.973
absolutely to be really to be understood within yourself.

23:51.133 --> 23:55.174
Sometimes My lectures, you see, are little harsh,

23:55.334 --> 23:59.274
people think that Mother had to say these things,

23:59.434 --> 24:02.441
this is also out of My love for you

24:02.601 --> 24:06.367
and out of My love for this country.

24:08.100 --> 24:10.873
You have to really see to yourself,

24:11.033 --> 24:18.968
"What are we? Where are we?"

24:20.067 --> 24:26.074
We are not going to end up because Sahaja Yogis we had

24:26.234 --> 24:34.567
were subnormal people in the society.

24:35.067 --> 24:37.907
If you see the gurus how they spread themselves,

24:38.067 --> 24:40.240
though they are false, they are useless

24:40.400 --> 24:44.107
but everybody knows about somebody who comes up. In two months time

24:44.267 --> 24:47.607
all over the world you can hear about that person.

24:47.767 --> 24:48.741
What they do,

24:48.901 --> 24:52.607
they go and first of all see the people who are successful,

24:52.767 --> 24:55.240
who are prominent in the city.

24:55.400 --> 24:58.808
They never bother about people who are drug addicts,

24:58.968 --> 25:01.641
or who are suffering from diseases, no nothing doing,

25:01.801 --> 25:05.107
they have no business with them.

25:05.267 --> 25:07.574
They'll just attack the people

25:07.734 --> 25:11.634
who are very successful, who are very rich,

25:12.434 --> 25:15.074
because they are on top of the society,

25:15.234 --> 25:17.441
so they'll go and meet people

25:17.601 --> 25:20.240
and make contacts with them and ask them and this and that

25:20.400 --> 25:22.873
and then they call them for the program,

25:23.033 --> 25:24.708
give them all the importance, everything,

25:24.868 --> 25:26.040
then people start thinking,

25:26.200 --> 25:29.541
"Oh God! What a great thing it is to be here."

25:29.701 --> 25:33.507
Then pamper their ego a little bit, this and that's how they spread.

25:33.667 --> 25:36.574
But there's no reality in it, there's nothing,

25:36.734 --> 25:37.808
nothing special about it,

25:37.968 --> 25:41.267
it's all useless, it's all artificial.

25:41.501 --> 25:43.907
But that is how they sell themselves.

25:44.067 --> 25:45.708
Though we do not want to sell ourselves,

25:45.868 --> 25:47.507
we have to know that

25:47.667 --> 25:52.501
unless and until we have some remarkable qualities,

25:53.300 --> 25:54.708
people are not going to look at us,

25:54.868 --> 25:57.574
because whatever has happened is within ourselves,

25:57.734 --> 25:59.940
and nobody sees the light,

26:00.100 --> 26:05.934
it's like a light which is burning, which is covered completely.

26:07.534 --> 26:09.240
So I've seen that

26:09.400 --> 26:12.741
I went to Columbia. In Columbia, you'll be amazed

26:12.901 --> 26:15.007
that people had never known Me,

26:15.167 --> 26:16.641
they had never heard My name,

26:16.801 --> 26:19.407
but I don't know why but

26:19.567 --> 26:24.407
the crowds were so much that I couldn't enter into the compound

26:24.567 --> 26:27.574
and with somehow or other I was pushed into it.

26:27.734 --> 26:30.040
Then in the hall was impossible,

26:30.200 --> 26:32.907
people were hanging on the –

26:33.067 --> 26:34.708
I thought they were hanging

26:34.868 --> 26:36.607
from the top, just sitting on the thing to watch Me over.

26:36.767 --> 26:40.040
So many people in every direction, in every height

26:40.200 --> 26:44.174
I found people there, I did not know how to settle them down.

26:44.334 --> 26:46.940
But they listened to Me very carefully this thing,

26:47.100 --> 26:50.240
two days we had the programmed, two days the crowds were there.

26:50.400 --> 26:54.441
And then when they had to follow-on they came,

26:54.601 --> 26:56.907
next day they disappeared.

26:57.067 --> 27:01.267
Same thing in Greece,

27:03.534 --> 27:09.274
same thing in Turkey.

27:09.434 --> 27:11.207
So there's definitely something wrong with us.

27:11.367 --> 27:13.040
Now there's a course coming up,

27:13.200 --> 27:18.240
people are trying to do the course business,

27:18.400 --> 27:20.207
but one should know it is not knowledge without love,

27:20.367 --> 27:22.007
it is love and knowledge.

27:22.167 --> 27:25.074
So how you talk to them,

27:25.234 --> 27:28.467
how you deal with them is there,

27:29.133 --> 27:31.307
but your dynamism is going to impress them.

27:31.467 --> 27:34.274
You can see the film we saw yesterday

27:34.434 --> 27:37.834
in which the music was there. Now what was it?

27:38.000 --> 27:41.107
There the energy was dynamic,

27:41.267 --> 27:42.374
the energy was dynamic, with the music and everything

27:42.534 --> 27:45.107
and that was showing.

27:45.267 --> 27:48.307
So you see you got engrossed into it,

27:48.467 --> 27:51.667
so the movement of that energy, the dynamism of that energy

27:53.133 --> 27:56.940
really got you engrossed.

27:57.100 --> 28:04.467
But to be afraid that you'll become right-sided is nonsensical,

28:07.734 --> 28:12.868
now you are in the center, how can you become right-sided?

28:13.868 --> 28:16.140
This kind of argument is only to support lethargy,

28:16.300 --> 28:19.140
then not to have any discipline.

28:19.300 --> 28:24.040
I was surprised that in Shudy Camp,

28:24.200 --> 28:26.907
where we have established a school for meditation,

28:27.067 --> 28:30.274
people come every week-end just to spend the week-end,

28:30.434 --> 28:31.774
they get up at 10 o'clock, 11 o'clock, 12 o'clock,

28:31.934 --> 28:35.200
whenever they feel like,

28:36.601 --> 28:39.708
they are on holidays in Shudy Camp.

28:39.868 --> 28:40.973
And two days they'll stay there without any meditation,

28:41.133 --> 28:43.074
without anything.

28:43.234 --> 28:46.734
We have come to Mother's house, finished.

28:48.267 --> 28:51.474
Mother has to do all the job for them.

28:51.634 --> 28:53.341
I mean, for a Sahaja Yogi it is minimum of minimum

28:53.501 --> 28:55.873
that they should get up early in the morning,

28:56.033 --> 28:59.901
have their bath and sit down for pujas.

29:00.300 --> 29:02.167
Is a common thing, all Indians do that way,

29:02.334 --> 29:04.441
It's a practice.

29:04.601 --> 29:08.107
Suddenly this country

29:08.267 --> 29:09.207
or these countries have gone into a kind of a lethargic

29:09.367 --> 29:12.968
nonsensical life,

29:15.834 --> 29:20.374
otherwise this country also used to do the same thing.

29:20.534 --> 29:25.808
And sleeping also: you have to sleep early if you want to,

29:25.968 --> 29:28.840
but one has to think that we have to change our lifestyle,

29:29.000 --> 29:34.074
we have to change our attitudes,

29:34.234 --> 29:35.708
so many things, see, like I said simple things, like I said,

29:35.868 --> 29:39.140
"The day you want to wash your hair,

29:39.300 --> 29:40.474
put lot of oil in your hair and then wash. We'll become bald."

29:40.634 --> 29:45.067
Imagine all bald Sahaja Yogis walking.

29:45.868 --> 29:50.968
They'll think your Mother has so many hair and what about your hair.

29:54.367 --> 29:57.140
In food also, too much, like

29:57.300 --> 30:01.207
I don't know here what is the situation, but in England I find

30:01.367 --> 30:02.674
they take so much of tea,

30:02.834 --> 30:06.801
all the time the tea is - the kettle is on the thing.

30:06.968 --> 30:09.407
I mean people are amazed

30:09.567 --> 30:12.973
when they, people come to Ganapatipule also in India,

30:13.133 --> 30:15.541
we don't take tea so many times,

30:15.701 --> 30:17.774
I mean twice at the most.

30:17.934 --> 30:19.641
The whole day people want tea there,

30:19.801 --> 30:20.973
they don't understand

30:21.133 --> 30:25.267
how can they go on drinking tea at one o'clock in the night.

30:27.133 --> 30:32.901
It's like the alcohol has become subtler: tea ,

30:37.133 --> 30:40.674
otherwise how do you explain?

30:40.834 --> 30:43.541
You can't take alcohol, so let's have tea,

30:43.701 --> 30:46.873
then settle down nicely, we are having cup-o-tea,

30:47.033 --> 30:48.641
in England very common:

30:48.801 --> 30:52.240
sit down nicely, cup-o-tea.

30:52.400 --> 30:57.708
What work have you done that you are settling down like that?

30:57.868 --> 31:02.634
Then whenever they'll come, "Haaa,"

31:02.901 --> 31:04.973
as if they have dug up something,

31:05.133 --> 31:10.074
or they have done the English Channel,

31:10.234 --> 31:12.708
they'll come, even on the television you'll see people,

31:12.868 --> 31:16.307
they come down, "Haa."

31:16.467 --> 31:19.207
I don't understand.

31:19.367 --> 31:21.307
You'll never find any Indian doing that,

31:21.467 --> 31:24.474
after all in that heat also, he'll never say that,

31:24.634 --> 31:27.907
because you think, think, think too much, just think,

31:28.067 --> 31:31.267
don't do anything about it.

31:32.133 --> 31:34.907
Like you file, you see, make a file,

31:35.067 --> 31:36.708
tomorrow is Mother's puja, all right,

31:36.868 --> 31:38.774
we'll have this, this, this - filed it.

31:38.934 --> 31:43.701
At the puja it is not there, why? It's in the file.

31:45.200 --> 31:55.567
And anything that is before your Realization,

31:55.767 --> 31:57.840
like people have an idea,

31:58.000 --> 32:01.374
like this how to avoid work, you see, labor saving.

32:01.534 --> 32:05.774
Labor saving is a very great asset of the Western people.

32:05.934 --> 32:07.474
So the labor saving how they will do.

32:07.634 --> 32:10.474
Supposing, you say, "Please, telephone to such a person."

32:10.634 --> 32:12.174
"Mother, I think he may not be there."

32:12.334 --> 32:15.934
"Baba, you telephone and find out."

32:16.734 --> 32:19.240
So the explanation comes from the brain,

32:19.400 --> 32:24.307
it may not. So nothing can be achieved.

32:24.467 --> 32:26.708
So first the labor saving was that

32:26.868 --> 32:31.074
"Oh, this is anti-culture, we should be –

32:31.234 --> 32:33.334
this is so bad, everything is so bad,

32:33.534 --> 32:36.074
we should start a very natural life,

32:36.234 --> 32:39.040
we should lead a very natural thing and that

32:39.200 --> 32:42.801
we should become primitive," and all that.

32:43.634 --> 32:48.808
From that if you grow in - from that area if you grow into Sahaja Yoga,

32:48.968 --> 32:51.801
you become subtler.

32:52.968 --> 32:56.207
So the subtler things that they become is this way:

32:56.367 --> 33:00.734
that now as it is, you see,

33:01.634 --> 33:06.407
"We should not do too much of everything, is too much, you see,

33:06.567 --> 33:08.834
it is too much."

33:09.367 --> 33:12.474
If you talk to somebody about Sahaja Yoga, they say,

33:12.634 --> 33:14.634
"It's too much for me."

33:14.801 --> 33:17.040
Hey, you have no brain or what is it?

33:17.200 --> 33:20.708
What is too much? Can't take it?

33:20.868 --> 33:22.907
"Oh it's too much."

33:23.067 --> 33:26.474
It's a very common experience with Me,

33:26.634 --> 33:30.107
that when I talk to people they would say, "It's too much."

33:30.267 --> 33:33.474
I mean your brain, is it a limited brain

33:33.634 --> 33:38.934
or what is it that you can't listen to Me what I am trying to tell you?

33:39.267 --> 33:43.541
And once you start developing this kind of attitude,

33:43.701 --> 33:45.407
the nourishment cannot reach you,

33:45.567 --> 33:48.973
supposing the trees say, "Oh it's too much,"

33:49.133 --> 33:52.934
then what are they going to do?

33:55.567 --> 33:57.474
Nothing is too much.

33:57.634 --> 34:00.474
"I have to grow, I have to take all the nourishment,

34:00.634 --> 34:03.641
I have to become something,

34:03.801 --> 34:06.708
I have to do such a lot.

34:06.868 --> 34:08.973
What have I done?"

34:09.133 --> 34:12.434
Nothing so far. Never be satisfied with yourself.

34:13.601 --> 34:16.341
I mean, some people who saw My program

34:16.501 --> 34:19.274
they were all shocked how Mother is going to do it.

34:19.434 --> 34:24.934
I said, "I know I am going to do it, if I have to do it, I'll do it."

34:29.968 --> 34:32.207
So this is what should be attitude:

34:32.367 --> 34:37.534
when you love Me I am your ideal. You must know that.

34:39.434 --> 34:43.541
If you love Me, then what are you doing about it?

34:43.701 --> 34:46.300
I am your ideal. You have to reach My style,

34:50.167 --> 34:54.601
otherwise Sahaja Yoga won't work out in these countries

34:58.934 --> 35:02.541
which have taken to lethargy as a great culture.

35:02.701 --> 35:07.968
I asked somebody, "What about your bathing,

35:08.634 --> 35:11.840
why didn't you take bath?"

35:12.000 --> 35:13.307
He said, "These days it is out of fashion to take bath."

35:13.467 --> 35:17.901
Everything seems to be out of fashion, whatever is in fashion is horrid.

35:18.634 --> 35:24.033
"It's very fashionable," is another thing people say,

35:24.467 --> 35:27.174
"it's very fashionable,"

35:27.334 --> 35:28.907
and whatever is fashionable looks so ugly to Me.

35:29.067 --> 35:33.801
Now if you have to take to the Sahaj culture,

35:35.200 --> 35:38.040
you have to know that we have to have a discipline in our life.

35:38.200 --> 35:42.107
We have to have education, we have to have a place,

35:42.267 --> 35:44.474
we have to have a position in the society.

35:44.634 --> 35:48.367
Because we are not sitting in the Himalayas,

35:49.200 --> 35:51.708
somewhere lost in the Himalayas sitting there

35:51.868 --> 35:55.708
and just doing our Tapasya.

35:55.868 --> 36:01.474
Tapasya is here where you live.

36:01.634 --> 36:07.901
Otherwise if you say that "All right we have to go to Himalayas

36:09.901 --> 36:13.441
and there we have to do Tapasya in the cold winds.

36:13.601 --> 36:17.341
Oh, that's very good."

36:17.501 --> 36:19.040
Because that looks like something, you see,

36:19.200 --> 36:21.374
you might have a name, or something like that.

36:21.534 --> 36:24.441
But Tapasya is here,

36:24.601 --> 36:26.534
the detachment has to be worked out here.

36:26.701 --> 36:29.133
You get involved into all these things,

36:29.300 --> 36:32.240
in a way sometimes surprises Me,

36:32.400 --> 36:35.074
the amount of involvement you have

36:35.234 --> 36:38.374
in the things which existed in gross form,

36:38.534 --> 36:45.374
they have become subtler and you are still bound by them,

36:45.534 --> 36:48.973
there's no freedom.

36:49.133 --> 36:52.334
And that's why when you see something absurd happening,

36:57.434 --> 37:00.808
you see something funny happening in Sahaja Yoga,

37:00.968 --> 37:03.574
it's just the symptom of that thing becoming subtler

37:03.734 --> 37:07.501
within us and its expressing itself.

37:07.667 --> 37:11.667
Like sometimes you may not see fire

37:13.667 --> 37:15.708
but it exists and suddenly you find a blast.

37:15.868 --> 37:21.534
So transformation of course means evolution,

37:23.300 --> 37:26.940
it also means that whatever basis you had,

37:27.100 --> 37:29.708
you have to evolve out of it.

37:29.868 --> 37:32.607
Like a flower blossoming and then becoming the fruit,

37:32.767 --> 37:41.574
but it has to drop out many things.

37:41.734 --> 37:46.100
And then with the nature one has to see such a unison.

37:49.501 --> 37:54.934
In the nature if you see, it sucks the water.

37:56.734 --> 38:03.040
Then the water is evaporated by the sun.

38:03.200 --> 38:08.507
Then it becomes a cloud and then the cloud waits,

38:08.667 --> 38:17.808
because the leaves drop out.

38:17.968 --> 38:20.240
In the winter time they nourish the tree with their nitrogen;

38:20.400 --> 38:27.341
when the time is ready,

38:27.501 --> 38:29.808
then these clouds pour down and again nourish this.

38:29.968 --> 38:36.708
Such a complete balance is in the nature.

38:36.868 --> 38:42.240
If it was not, I tell you they would, we would, have said,

38:42.400 --> 38:46.374
"all bald headed lands here."

38:46.534 --> 38:51.133
If you go to any, any forest, any forest, it's so clean,

38:52.200 --> 38:57.040
you never have any bad smell anywhere whatsoever.

38:57.200 --> 39:01.441
There are animals, there are tigers, that, this –

39:01.601 --> 39:04.708
never get any smell anywhere,

39:04.868 --> 39:07.274
you never even get the smell of a tiger.

39:07.434 --> 39:09.307
But if you put the tiger in a cage then he starts smelling,

39:09.467 --> 39:14.574
he's so much bathed in the nature, he lives with the nature,

39:14.734 --> 39:18.240
and in such balance.

39:18.400 --> 39:22.107
It's such an understanding among all the animals, everything.

39:22.267 --> 39:25.574
I don't know how they keep it so clean,

39:25.734 --> 39:29.574
but as soon as you get some smell,

39:29.734 --> 39:33.307
you will find out there must be some human being somewhere,

39:33.467 --> 39:38.801
or some untidiness.

39:40.267 --> 39:43.868
It's so organized how the leaves grow according to the sun's rays,

39:44.634 --> 39:49.374
how they organize themselves,

39:49.534 --> 39:51.307
how they build up themselves.

39:51.467 --> 39:55.674
So if you really have to get to the nature of Sahaja Yoga,

39:55.834 --> 39:59.541
we should get all these blessings

39:59.701 --> 40:04.240
by which we should prosper.

40:04.400 --> 40:07.107
Not, I mean in money and things, but in every way.

40:07.267 --> 40:14.100
So it should not be a set of people who are just sort of parasites.

40:14.400 --> 40:20.834
And I wish for you that you understand what I am saying today

40:23.033 --> 40:29.341
and I request you, all of you,

40:29.501 --> 40:33.007
to be alert and dynamic

40:33.167 --> 40:35.940
and work it out.

40:36.100 --> 40:37.607
Each single person has to come up.

40:37.767 --> 40:40.240
It's not going to work out if you wear some saffron clothes

40:40.400 --> 40:43.774
and go on singing "Hare Rama, Hare Krishna" on the street.

40:43.934 --> 40:46.708
No. It's not going to work out.

40:46.868 --> 40:50.868
Nor it is going to work out if you say,

40:53.334 --> 40:55.307
"We are Sahaja Yogis, we are such people and this and that."

40:55.467 --> 40:58.774
Nothing. You have to be something.

40:58.934 --> 41:03.601
So on one side, the dynamism is to be used for yourself

41:03.868 --> 41:08.074
and the dynamism is to be used for Sahaja Yoga.

41:08.234 --> 41:12.934
You need not now worry about right-sidedness.

41:13.834 --> 41:18.667
Is very common even in ...

41:19.634 --> 41:21.641
This happened: I found in Holland

41:21.801 --> 41:24.507
that I married one girl, very dynamic girl, to someone

41:24.667 --> 41:29.674
and the husband said, "Mother, she doesn't help me."

41:29.834 --> 41:33.174
I said, "Why?"

41:33.334 --> 41:34.541
"Because I'm afraid I'll become right-sided."

41:34.701 --> 41:37.574
I said, "But why did I marry you to this left-sided fellow?

41:37.734 --> 41:42.040
That you become left-sided?"

41:42.200 --> 41:44.474
Left-sided is a very good thing

41:44.634 --> 41:46.474
because you don't have to do anything, just you have to say,

41:46.634 --> 41:49.240
"I don't want to become right-sided," that's all.

41:49.400 --> 41:53.100
But right-sidedness means you have to look,

41:58.133 --> 42:00.973
you have to be alert, you have to be clever

42:01.133 --> 42:04.407
and you have to know everything.

42:04.567 --> 42:08.701
You'll sit in the sun, burn your skins,

42:10.601 --> 42:12.973
but look at the sun.

42:13.133 --> 42:14.808
Are you on the sun line or on the moon line?

42:14.968 --> 42:19.434
So the swing of all the Western people is on the left hand side.

42:22.767 --> 42:28.300
Drinking, pubs, like in 24 hours they sleep,

42:29.234 --> 42:38.074
say maybe fourteen hours,

42:38.234 --> 42:38.234
maybe eighteen hours,

42:42.033 --> 42:45.808
rest of the time they drink, that's all.

42:45.968 --> 42:50.574
We have one house being built next to us,

42:50.734 --> 42:51.973
when we shifted there, they said,

42:52.133 --> 42:55.074
"This is practically finished now" - still finishing

42:55.234 --> 42:57.140
and will take at least three years more maybe,

42:57.300 --> 42:58.907
may never finish.

42:59.067 --> 43:02.274
It's like the mathematics, you see, you have this

43:02.434 --> 43:05.774
that there was a work and somebody came,

43:05.934 --> 43:08.407
he did one tenth and ran away.

43:08.567 --> 43:11.307
Then somebody came did one twentieth and ran away.

43:11.467 --> 43:13.741
Then somebody came he did one fortieth and ran away.

43:13.901 --> 43:15.907
When will the work finish? It will never finish,

43:16.067 --> 43:20.040
with such running away people, never finish.

43:20.200 --> 43:22.174
Same thing is Sahaja Yoga.

43:22.334 --> 43:23.808
If you put mathematically,

43:23.968 --> 43:26.307
Sahaja Yoga can never be established in America,

43:26.467 --> 43:31.400
if you add up more and more of this kind of people.

43:33.734 --> 43:35.774
So much is happening in this country,

43:35.934 --> 43:39.074
but you have to see those people, you have to meet those people

43:39.234 --> 43:42.873
who are at the helm of affairs, who are the people who matter,

43:43.033 --> 43:47.507
who are scientific, who are talking about something sensible.

43:47.667 --> 43:51.234
You have to talk to them, get to them.

43:54.434 --> 43:57.107
We don't need cinema actors and actresses,

43:57.267 --> 44:00.774
but we need people who are dynamic.

44:00.934 --> 44:02.541
And this may work out

44:02.701 --> 44:08.133
if you put your minds to it and we have something to show them.

44:09.734 --> 44:11.607
I would say that Austria is one place

44:11.767 --> 44:13.708
where Sahaja Yoga has worked very well,

44:13.868 --> 44:19.234
Milan is another place and where most of them are professionals.

44:20.467 --> 44:24.973
It's very surprising, in modern times we are living.

44:25.133 --> 44:27.374
We are not living in those ancient times

44:27.534 --> 44:30.973
where the Rishi Munis used to sit under a tree

44:31.133 --> 44:35.133
and the kings used to come and touch their feet.

44:36.467 --> 44:37.973
Is the other way round;

44:38.133 --> 44:44.868
the Rishi Munis have to go and talk to the kings.

44:46.467 --> 44:49.374
So when we believe that we are Sahaja Yogis

44:49.534 --> 44:51.474
we have to know that in a subtle way

44:51.634 --> 44:53.341
we are still caught up into the webs of

44:53.501 --> 44:58.973
our own understanding about life. So, that we have to change.

44:59.133 --> 45:02.708
Life for us is nothing but Sahaja Yoga

45:02.868 --> 45:10.734
and Sahaja Yoga is nothing but enlightening ourselves and others.

45:13.534 --> 45:17.774
So I hope you will listen to My lecture today,

45:17.934 --> 45:20.873
you will take the tapes home and listen to them

45:21.033 --> 45:22.808
again and again.

45:22.968 --> 45:25.774
Also there's a warning from people that

45:25.934 --> 45:32.808
"Mother, what they do is to take one tape for one center

45:32.968 --> 45:35.973
and everybody listens it and then finished."

45:36.133 --> 45:41.200
Meaning, you all should have one tape each.

45:41.901 --> 45:44.374
Even that, people don't do.

45:44.534 --> 45:46.808
Not only that, but now it might be after some time

45:46.968 --> 45:53.968
only one, one tape in circulation in one country.

45:54.133 --> 45:57.641
They circulate; say, today in New York, tomorrow in Boston,

45:57.801 --> 46:01.940
like that. You have to listen to it again and again.

46:02.100 --> 46:04.708
Sit down with your paper and pencil,

46:04.868 --> 46:07.007
see for yourself what I am saying.

46:07.167 --> 46:09.708
Every tape should be with you.

46:09.868 --> 46:11.940
I mean, these horrible gurus' tapes

46:12.100 --> 46:16.140
you can hear them in every car, in every place,

46:16.300 --> 46:18.907
everyone they have it.

46:19.067 --> 46:23.634
And why is it Sahaja Yogis don't have any tapes with them?

46:24.167 --> 46:27.200
You can make copies.

46:29.634 --> 46:32.808
But if you can get it free, they'll like to have.

46:32.968 --> 46:38.734
That's the first thing, what we can get free, cheaply, easily.

46:39.567 --> 46:44.234
If you try to save money, the money tries to save itself.

46:45.701 --> 46:48.601
It's a mutual understanding.

46:55.501 --> 46:58.940
It's as simple as this: supposing you open only one door,

46:59.100 --> 47:00.207
no air will come in.

47:00.367 --> 47:02.808
You open the other door the air will start flowing.

47:02.968 --> 47:06.067
It's a circulation.

47:09.267 --> 47:11.741
All this can be your own knowledge too,

47:11.901 --> 47:14.968
I need not say anything, this is all in your brains,

47:15.133 --> 47:18.174
only open out yourself, you are not free people.

47:18.334 --> 47:19.541
If you are free like Me,

47:19.701 --> 47:24.234
you'll see all these things coming from your own brains.

47:26.000 --> 47:30.307
Specially for America, really, as you know, I am working very hard

47:30.467 --> 47:33.140
and I want to work it out because,

47:33.300 --> 47:36.307
if America is not all right, My Vishuddhi is not going to be all right.

47:36.467 --> 47:40.100
It's going to trouble Me throughout.

47:41.968 --> 47:46.274
So you have to take it up upon yourself.

47:46.434 --> 47:50.133
I don't say, "Take the cross."

47:52.467 --> 47:55.407
You don't have to sacrifice anything,

47:55.567 --> 48:02.507
but you have to be just aware about what are we,

48:02.667 --> 48:06.200
what are we doing, where are we?

48:06.367 --> 48:08.541
And on top of that,

48:08.701 --> 48:14.567
Sahaja Yogis think they are obliging Sahaja Yoga and Me too.

48:14.868 --> 48:19.940
This is something. It's to be explained this way:

48:20.100 --> 48:22.641
I don't need Sahaja Yoga, you need Sahaja Yoga

48:22.801 --> 48:24.840
and everybody needs Sahaja Yoga.

48:25.000 --> 48:27.140
You had in this country people like,

48:27.300 --> 48:29.674
I mean such great, great people you had

48:29.834 --> 48:33.441
I need not mention - persons like Abraham Lincoln

48:33.601 --> 48:38.901
who gave such great ideas to the whole world.

48:40.701 --> 48:43.174
Why not you people be great?

48:43.334 --> 48:45.007
He was a realized soul, all right,

48:45.167 --> 48:51.000
but he didn't know anything about Ida, Pingala and Sushumna.

48:52.267 --> 48:56.033
Why can't you become great like him?

49:01.701 --> 49:04.808
So on a Virata Puja we have to decide

49:04.968 --> 49:07.574
that we are all going to express

49:07.734 --> 49:13.541
the conception that was once the Virat

49:13.701 --> 49:16.007
as reality in our lives.

49:16.167 --> 49:20.601
This is what we have to pray from our heart.

49:23.868 --> 49:27.574
And it's a very good occasion today to do that,

49:27.734 --> 49:31.641
because we are sitting in a place where there were

49:31.801 --> 49:38.407
so many of these aboriginal people, you call them, anything.

49:38.567 --> 49:41.907
They were so sensible,

49:42.067 --> 49:45.708
as in America you say brass tacks, you see.

49:45.868 --> 49:54.007
They knew the principle how to lead a real spiritual life.

49:54.167 --> 49:58.674
They were very free people, extremely free

49:58.834 --> 50:02.574
and so detached.

50:02.734 --> 50:04.940
So if you do not correct yourself,

50:05.100 --> 50:07.407
then there will be a problem on collectivity.

50:07.567 --> 50:09.274
If there's a problem in collectivity,

50:09.434 --> 50:11.574
it will reflect on you,

50:11.734 --> 50:14.541
because you are part and parcel of the whole.

50:14.701 --> 50:17.674
If there's a problem in the whole being

50:17.834 --> 50:19.341
there's a problem for you.

50:19.501 --> 50:21.474
And if there's a problem in one part,

50:21.634 --> 50:23.774
there's a problem for the whole being.

50:23.934 --> 50:26.808
Even Roosevelt who was your president once said that

50:26.968 --> 50:30.541
"Poverty anywhere is a threat to prosperity everywhere."

50:30.701 --> 50:34.234
He could see this point so clearly.

50:35.234 --> 50:37.400
You see, all these sayings show us

50:37.567 --> 50:40.341
that this is a country of Virat,

50:40.501 --> 50:42.107
where they talk of collectivity,

50:42.267 --> 50:45.808
they have all the communications

50:45.968 --> 50:47.774
which are important.

50:47.934 --> 50:50.207
Every sort of communication is important,

50:50.367 --> 50:51.374
but for Sahaja Yogis

50:51.534 --> 50:54.741
it has to be very subtle, very dynamic,

50:54.901 --> 50:57.174
very beautiful, very loving,

50:57.334 --> 51:01.274
very impressive, magnetic.

51:01.434 --> 51:04.968
Then only the communications will work.

51:05.801 --> 51:09.840
There's no harm in wearing very nice dresses.

51:10.000 --> 51:15.341
There's no harm in wearing - nice doesn't mean expensive,

51:15.501 --> 51:21.067
but means which are sensible, dignified.

51:23.100 --> 51:26.474
We have to build up our personalities,

51:26.634 --> 51:31.567
that people should feel that "Oh, this is something, eh."

51:35.434 --> 51:39.667
And your children will also learn from you.

51:41.400 --> 51:44.140
There's no question of feeling that

51:44.300 --> 51:46.907
you'll be driven into ego or anything,

51:47.067 --> 51:52.067
that's finished now, ego is finished here, there's no ego.

51:53.300 --> 51:57.541
What I find here is a justification

51:57.701 --> 51:58.808
for doing nothing

51:58.968 --> 52:04.234
that we do not want to do anything because our ego will come up.

52:06.834 --> 52:09.567
Very clever.

52:17.234 --> 52:20.541
So with all this one has to know

52:20.701 --> 52:23.107
that we are selected people,

52:23.267 --> 52:26.607
we are chosen people of God.

52:26.767 --> 52:28.973
He must have selected us with some purpose,

52:29.133 --> 52:32.507
otherwise there are so many people in this country.

52:32.667 --> 52:36.507
You are the foundation and you have to be solid people

52:36.667 --> 52:38.868
to be the foundation.

52:40.033 --> 52:42.541
Must know our own glory,

52:42.701 --> 52:45.708
our own speciality

52:45.868 --> 52:48.341
that why we are selected,

52:48.501 --> 52:51.334
of all the people why are we there?

52:51.501 --> 52:55.234
Then, what are we doing about it?

52:57.601 --> 52:59.741
Normal life you do see that way,

52:59.901 --> 53:03.240
like if somebody is selected for a post or something,

53:03.400 --> 53:05.808
out of many, many things, "Oh must be something about me,

53:05.968 --> 53:08.808
I must show my worth, I must show my value,

53:08.968 --> 53:10.907
I must show my work," you see,

53:11.067 --> 53:17.641
and he works hard to prove that the selection was good.

53:17.801 --> 53:20.674
But in Sahaja Yoga it's the other way round,

53:20.834 --> 53:22.907
you take it for granted,

53:23.067 --> 53:25.441
"Oh, we are something great."

53:25.601 --> 53:30.868
So now settle down with yourself - have a cup of tea.

53:36.234 --> 53:40.407
I hope it has been understood why I am saying so,

53:40.567 --> 53:43.607
because I am really concerned about America.

53:43.767 --> 53:46.674
So many negative forces are working here

53:46.834 --> 53:50.434
and we have to improve.

53:52.067 --> 53:55.074
So many things such a big responsibility,

53:55.234 --> 53:58.040
such a big country, such a vast country,

53:58.200 --> 54:06.441
so much perversion, so much nonsensical ideologies,

54:06.601 --> 54:09.374
I mean endless.

54:09.534 --> 54:15.334
Even if you get fifteen Gorbachevs, you cannot change this country.

54:16.567 --> 54:19.207
It has gone amuck.

54:19.367 --> 54:21.774
Everybody's an individual,

54:21.934 --> 54:24.374
this mad place.

54:24.534 --> 54:27.507
One Gorbachev can change that country

54:27.667 --> 54:30.040
which has much more population.

54:30.200 --> 54:32.207
But no one can change this country

54:32.367 --> 54:36.667
unless and until you people decide to do something about it.

54:39.067 --> 54:41.441
So I'm told some people are frustrated

54:41.601 --> 54:44.207
because there are not so many Sahaja Yogis are coming,

54:44.367 --> 54:46.641
but may be something wrong with you.

54:46.801 --> 54:48.374
Maybe that you are not deep enough

54:48.534 --> 54:52.834
and that you are not so much impressive.

54:56.000 --> 54:58.174
You have to change your life style,

54:58.334 --> 55:03.701
you have to be smart people and spartan.

55:07.267 --> 55:13.040
I hope, I hope again and again that after this Virata's Puja

55:13.200 --> 55:17.067
you all will come up on the stage as great Viratas.

55:17.234 --> 55:18.934
May God bless you all.
