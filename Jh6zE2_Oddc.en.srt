00:00:01,686 --> 00:00:10,293
Today we are celebrating the great event

2
00:00:10,492 --> 00:00:15,563
of the resurrection of Christ.

3
00:00:17,938 --> 00:00:24,359
On the same pattern is your resurrection;

4
00:00:24,748 --> 00:00:34,945
that you have risen to the new life of Divine love.

5
00:00:49,272 --> 00:01:02,000
You were all in the knowledge that
there’s something higher has to happen to you;

6
00:01:03,065 --> 00:01:13,367
that you are to be born again, but nobody knew how it works.

7
00:01:14,297 --> 00:01:24,426
The subtle side of your being was never told to you.

8
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:30,071
The saints only talked as to how you should behave.

9
00:01:30,198 --> 00:01:40,582
They only said how you should try to keep a very pure life,

10
00:01:41,063 --> 00:01:50,630
sincere life, but they didn't tell you how it will work out.

11
00:01:51,174 --> 00:01:59,542
Of course people knew in India about it,

12
00:01:59,741 --> 00:02:05,764
very few of them, very, very few of them,

13
00:02:06,604 --> 00:02:15,321
but now it's a worldwide knowledge through you people.

14
00:02:18,643 --> 00:02:29,929
Now while your Kundalini rises,
She is your Mother, She is your individual Mother,

15
00:02:30,214 --> 00:02:35,387
 and She gives you the second birth.

16
00:02:36,128 --> 00:02:50,098
That's how you get connected to the Divine paradise.

17
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:57,229
All this, if it is told without realization has no meaning,

18
00:02:57,381 --> 00:03:04,060
but people are given great ideas about it

19
00:03:04,179 --> 00:03:16,632
and also were promised that one day your resurrection will come.

20
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:21,090
It is the greatest happening for you,

21
00:03:23,821 --> 00:03:27,249
 is the greatest event of your life,

22
00:03:27,823 --> 00:03:36,413
and one must consider it’s very fortunate
that you have been able to achieve it.

23
00:03:37,444 --> 00:03:44,754
All this because also because you desired for it.

24
00:03:44,818 --> 00:03:59,833
In many of your lives
you have been desiring for the heavenly paradise.

25
00:04:00,846 --> 00:04:11,814
People have been going round in the
hills and dales seeking; doing all kinds of things.

26
00:04:12,432 --> 00:04:16,442
That's already done by you.

27
00:04:16,632 --> 00:04:23,534
You don't have to give up anything, no need to give up anything.

28
00:04:23,962 --> 00:04:29,712
This wrong idea; I should say an untimely idea.

29
00:04:31,239 --> 00:04:40,183
This is the time when you have to get your
Sahaja resurrection, spontaneous resurrection.

30
00:04:41,475 --> 00:04:48,216
You don't have to do anything about it,

31
00:04:48,366 --> 00:04:54,972
 it's just so simple as that; has worked out so well.

32
00:04:55,567 --> 00:05:04,441
I was really very much overjoyed to see that so many people,

33
00:05:04,577 --> 00:05:10,049
specially Muslims, about whom I have been so much worried

34
00:05:10,264 --> 00:05:13,665
 that how can you save these people?

35
00:05:14,181 --> 00:05:21,450
They are so much lost in the mess of wrong thinking.

36
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:33,099
One has to understand that this Koran was written

37
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:38,646
forty years after the death of Mohammed Sahib.

38
00:05:39,559 --> 00:05:43,923
So maybe that there might be some words which are being,

39
00:05:44,001 --> 00:05:55,995
 just being shifted maybe,
and the meaning might be little bit ambiguous.

40
00:05:57,154 --> 00:06:08,020
Also there was another book called Sunna came out about the same time

41
00:06:08,803 --> 00:06:15,766
 and was managed by a person who was not such a great

42
00:06:15,926 --> 00:06:21,584
soul I should say, because he was not a realized soul.

43
00:06:22,183 --> 00:06:30,111
I can't understand how can you religiously understand a poet same

44
00:06:30,376 --> 00:06:37,299
and in the poetry whatever is written,
how can you interpret it correctly?

45
00:06:37,545 --> 00:06:43,908
This is the reason why I, I am a poet also;

46
00:06:44,059 --> 00:06:48,882
 I could have written a poetry about it but I said no.

47
00:06:49,025 --> 00:06:57,092
Poetry can twist, can be twisted and also people can misuse it.

48
00:06:57,568 --> 00:07:00,287
That’s the problem with the poetry is.

49
00:07:00,638 --> 00:07:03,344
In India we had the same problem.

50
00:07:03,981 --> 00:07:08,256
For example, Kabira wrote such beautiful poetry

51
00:07:08,526 --> 00:07:12,113
 and the way they interpreted was so nonsensical

52
00:07:12,183 --> 00:07:19,100
and so much different from the spirit of Kabira's songs.

53
00:07:19,346 --> 00:07:25,047
About everything they can twist the words

54
00:07:25,129 --> 00:07:34,070
 according to their own need,
I found out if I wrote poetry about Divinity.

55
00:07:35,725 --> 00:07:39,035
This exactly what has happened.

56
00:07:39,154 --> 00:07:46,861
In all the religions I’ve seen,
when it comes to poetry people can twist it.

57
00:07:47,440 --> 00:08:01,129
Also, like in Bible, it was so much accepted

58
00:08:01,308 --> 00:08:12,039
that Paul is the one who is going to organize
the publication about Christ,

59
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:18,386
 and he didn't want to write also about resurrection;

60
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:22,961
he didn't want to write about the Immaculate Conception.

61
00:08:23,175 --> 00:08:26,985
All these things were in his mind

62
00:08:27,175 --> 00:08:33,596
and so Thomas had to run away to India
 and John refused to write anything.

63
00:08:35,141 --> 00:08:38,345
Because all such people take charge.

64
00:08:38,575 --> 00:08:40,450
They become in charge.

65
00:08:40,633 --> 00:08:47,768
They think they are responsible for it,
while they are not at all capable.

66
00:08:47,893 --> 00:08:51,683
They don't have the right to do it.

67
00:08:53,214 --> 00:08:58,073
As a result of that, Christianity took a very

68
00:08:58,162 --> 00:09:04,192
 wrong attitude towards the inner growth of human being.

69
00:09:06,271 --> 00:09:15,326
It’s, you see the result of that - today when you see what's happening

70
00:09:15,859 --> 00:09:19,074
with the Catholic Church, you are amazed.

71
00:09:19,189 --> 00:09:24,730
How can such an organization be a religious organization,

72
00:09:24,857 --> 00:09:29,253
where all kinds of nonsensical things are going on?

73
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:36,671
I was also born in a Christian family and
I was shocked the way they interpreted

74
00:09:37,282 --> 00:09:42,527
Christ's life and the way talked about it with great authority.

75
00:09:43,575 --> 00:09:45,525
Books and books were written.

76
00:09:46,026 --> 00:09:48,335
They give big, big sermons.

77
00:09:48,486 --> 00:09:52,348
I thought there's no truth in it what they are talking;

78
00:09:52,724 --> 00:09:55,414
even My father felt the same way.

79
00:09:56,541 --> 00:10:02,525
Because all these books came much after,

80
00:10:02,938 --> 00:10:05,806
the authors of these books.

81
00:10:06,329 --> 00:10:12,594
Secondly, those who tried to write it were not authorized to do that.

82
00:10:12,787 --> 00:10:15,067
They were not spiritual people.

83
00:10:15,467 --> 00:10:22,172
They all wanted to have power; they wanted to have power in religion.

84
00:10:24,126 --> 00:10:31,078
The power in religion is inside, and that should be awakened.

85
00:10:31,658 --> 00:10:38,159
I must say thanks to the Sufis of this country and other countries

86
00:10:38,265 --> 00:10:46,685
 that people still think that there is something
beyond all these words and talks and books.

87
00:10:48,566 --> 00:10:56,946
This is something, such a blessing that we have
that in every country we had someone

88
00:10:57,127 --> 00:11:00,779
who talked about reality, about the truth;

89
00:11:00,914 --> 00:11:08,157
 though they were condemned, they were tortured,
and so many of them were killed.

90
00:11:09,245 --> 00:11:21,551
This is happening even today; I find that
people don't want to listen to reality, to the truth.

91
00:11:22,321 --> 00:11:25,749
But I was so happy yesterday, really overjoyed,

92
00:11:25,884 --> 00:11:33,845
 to see that even the people who were Muslims, were Islamic,

93
00:11:33,988 --> 00:11:46,292
have now coming together, understanding that
 they have a higher life than these rituals of everyday.

94
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:55,745
All these ritualistic life that they have led,
the way they have worked so hard,

95
00:11:56,509 --> 00:12:05,996
They these forty days starvation, going for Hajj -

96
00:12:06,258 --> 00:12:11,856
doing all kinds of things - but there was no unity among themselves.

97
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:15,472
Even among themselves there was no unity,

98
00:12:15,533 --> 00:12:23,226
 and some places I was surprised that they were killing each other.

99
00:12:25,236 --> 00:12:27,278
How can that be?

100
00:12:27,467 --> 00:12:34,282
Because these so called practices did not make them collective.

101
00:12:34,463 --> 00:12:36,715
They were not collective.

102
00:12:36,795 --> 00:12:41,621
They were all separate identities, separate sects,

103
00:12:41,868 --> 00:12:49,132
guided by absolutely ignorant people.

104
00:12:50,335 --> 00:12:57,980
So we have to really celebrate the unity of these people,

105
00:12:58,036 --> 00:13:04,654
 the collective nature of these people, who were lost to the truth.

106
00:13:05,146 --> 00:13:10,823
They had no idea as to what truth is,

107
00:13:11,109 --> 00:13:19,156
but still a seeker can never find consolation

108
00:13:19,243 --> 00:13:22,338
with whatever exists.

109
00:13:22,806 --> 00:13:29,907
He’s seeking; he’s seeking and seeking till he finds the truth.

110
00:13:30,135 --> 00:13:34,446
But also there are many seekers who lose their way.

111
00:13:35,363 --> 00:13:38,079
In seeking they get lost.

112
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:44,769
It's very difficult to convince them that you have lost your way.

113
00:13:45,031 --> 00:13:48,991
But they should see from their own lives.

114
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:56,248
They should see from their own attainment.

115
00:13:56,683 --> 00:14:00,238
What have they achieved?

116
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,028
Have they got any experience?

117
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:14,242
To be convinced of what you have got, you must try to verify it.

118
00:14:15,133 --> 00:14:22,816
You can verify on people; you can verify on yourself.

119
00:14:23,403 --> 00:14:30,935
Whatever you are, you know on your fingertips as they say.

120
00:14:31,408 --> 00:14:35,286
Now it’s said in the Koran,

121
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:39,257
that at the time of your Kiyama – means resurrection time –

122
00:14:39,319 --> 00:14:43,808
 they’re two things Kiyamat and Kiyama – two things –

123
00:14:44,062 --> 00:14:46,766
also many people don’t understand the difference.

124
00:14:46,986 --> 00:14:51,166
One is when the resurrection time comes,

125
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:56,388
 and the another is when your destruction comes in.

126
00:14:56,831 --> 00:15:02,788
For the resurrection of human being is the Kiyama,

127
00:15:02,939 --> 00:15:08,139
 in which it’s said that your hands will speak;

128
00:15:08,425 --> 00:15:14,951
that you should feel the vibrations on your fingertips.

129
00:15:15,097 --> 00:15:27,757
I would say those who are really Muslims,
who are surrendered, and those who have been

130
00:15:27,876 --> 00:15:42,472
selected to be higher people belonging to
the God's realm must have hands that can speak;

131
00:15:42,982 --> 00:15:45,522
otherwise they are not Muslims.

132
00:15:45,761 --> 00:15:47,935
I would not call them Muslims.

133
00:15:48,109 --> 00:15:52,597
They may be human beings, but not Muslims.

134
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:58,043
So it's compulsory that for every Muslim,

135
00:15:58,147 --> 00:16:04,192
he thinks he’s a Muslim, he should have vibrations in his hands.

136
00:16:04,486 --> 00:16:06,931
He should feel the vibration.

137
00:16:07,036 --> 00:16:21,618
His hands must speak at the time of resurrection,
 which is the Kiyama, Kiyama - not Kiyamat.

138
00:16:21,957 --> 00:16:26,967
These two words are confused in the minds of the people.

139
00:16:27,087 --> 00:16:36,670
So those people who can verify about
their achievements themselves

140
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:40,468
through their vibrations on their hands,

141
00:16:40,588 --> 00:16:46,912
and also about others through their fingertips are the Muslims;

142
00:16:47,185 --> 00:16:53,364
 according to Koran, but nobody has told them this.

143
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,245
They don't know.

144
00:16:55,473 --> 00:16:58,675
To them it’s all right if you go to Mecca

145
00:16:58,794 --> 00:17:02,726
and come back from there; you become a Hajji, finished.

146
00:17:03,194 --> 00:17:07,810
There’s another question one should ask which is very important -

147
00:17:07,862 --> 00:17:15,144
that why Mohammed Sahib was so much against stone worshipping,

148
00:17:15,216 --> 00:17:20,047
 clearly, why did He ask people to go round

149
00:17:20,126 --> 00:17:24,195
that black square stone?

150
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:27,630
What was the purpose of that?

151
00:17:27,856 --> 00:17:33,664
Why was that stone so important?

152
00:17:34,336 --> 00:17:42,221
If you ask this question to any so called Muslim
he’ll say that was the order,

153
00:17:42,512 --> 00:17:47,092
 but you can ask the question after all why?

154
00:17:47,123 --> 00:17:49,329
That's also just a stone.

155
00:17:49,354 --> 00:17:58,936
So why did, why did Mohammed Sahib ask
that you should go round that stone?

156
00:18:00,225 --> 00:18:06,041
So many statues were there made of stone

157
00:18:06,407 --> 00:18:13,248
 and people started worshipping all kinds of statues
as they do in India also.

158
00:18:13,655 --> 00:18:17,532
But this stone was a Swayambhu,

159
00:18:17,626 --> 00:18:23,820
and is mentioned in the Indian scriptures
that there is Meccashwar Shiva.

160
00:18:24,255 --> 00:18:30,976
We have Shivas everywhere in India; there are twelve Jyotirlingas.

161
00:18:31,173 --> 00:18:36,893
Now if I tell you, you need not believe Me,
but you can go and verify on your vibrations

162
00:18:36,918 --> 00:18:41,958
if it is a Shiva or not; same with this black stone.

163
00:18:42,251 --> 00:18:47,544
So Mohammed Sahib found out that this is a Meccashwar Shiva

164
00:18:47,606 --> 00:18:59,109
and so the people have to go round to achieve Shiva's blessings,
but it became a ritual.

165
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:07,816
The whole thing became like a ritual
and nobody could go further from that ritual.

166
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:10,893
Same thing with the Christianity.

167
00:19:12,648 --> 00:19:18,069
Why today is a day they are talking so big
 about repentance

168
00:19:18,234 --> 00:19:25,981
 and about feeling guilty about what
they have done, but why did they do it?

169
00:19:26,527 --> 00:19:37,033
They are supposed to be in charge of goodness,
 of virtues - so why did they do it?

170
00:19:37,254 --> 00:19:43,950
Why did they do wrong things and now asking forgiveness from God?

171
00:19:44,103 --> 00:19:48,679
Because they were not realized souls.

172
00:19:49,301 --> 00:19:51,721
They’re not Sahaja Yogis.

173
00:19:51,824 --> 00:19:56,910
If the Sahaja Yogis try to do something wrong

174
00:19:57,326 --> 00:20:01,002
then they know that they are doing wrong on their fingertips,

175
00:20:01,082 --> 00:20:05,387
 or we can ask them to get out of Sahaja Yoga,

176
00:20:05,809 --> 00:20:09,693
but that seems to be the worst punishment for Sahaja Yogis.

177
00:20:10,284 --> 00:20:14,397
If I tell them to get out of Sahaja Yoga, they don't like it.

178
00:20:15,067 --> 00:20:16,565
Why?

179
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:25,003
Because they feel we are separated from reality.

180
00:20:25,313 --> 00:20:32,544
All the blessings of the reality are lost to them;
they think that way.

181
00:20:36,748 --> 00:20:44,088
The punishment is nothing,
because we just ask you get out of Sahaja Yoga.

182
00:20:44,406 --> 00:20:50,474
To look at it’s nothing, but Sahaja Yoga is complete freedom.

183
00:20:51,037 --> 00:20:54,844
Sahaja Yoga is complete blessing.

184
00:20:55,511 --> 00:20:59,817
Sahaja Yoga is complete peace and joy.

185
00:21:00,674 --> 00:21:07,009
Surprisingly, if you read Koran you’ll be amazed that Mohammed Sahib

186
00:21:07,105 --> 00:21:13,595
 wanted to bring peace, but it's not so.

187
00:21:15,564 --> 00:21:19,270
I met one man from Kashmir.

188
00:21:19,417 --> 00:21:22,955
He said that, “Where is the peace?

189
00:21:24,042 --> 00:21:27,411
They are all fighting, fighting; we want peace.”

190
00:21:27,736 --> 00:21:32,741
But surprisingly, he said, “In India we find there’s peace.

191
00:21:33,047 --> 00:21:38,169
But this Kashmir is a mad place
where everybody is all the time challenged

192
00:21:38,286 --> 00:21:43,108
and everything attacked - under the name of Islam itself.”

193
00:21:45,015 --> 00:21:47,393
So I said, it's not Islam.

194
00:21:47,515 --> 00:21:50,418
Islam means surrender.

195
00:21:50,505 --> 00:21:54,056
And he said, “If you surrender they‘ll kill you.

196
00:21:54,294 --> 00:21:58,141
We have no protection.”

197
00:21:58,801 --> 00:22:02,599
It's very surprising, very, very surprising,

198
00:22:02,854 --> 00:22:06,782
 how now the Muslims themselves are realizing

199
00:22:06,936 --> 00:22:12,626
that this cannot be Divine life.
This cannot be Divine life,

200
00:22:13,015 --> 00:22:20,626
because in Divine life people are just the same with each other.

201
00:22:20,834 --> 00:22:24,283
You see we had Sufis all over the world.

202
00:22:24,636 --> 00:22:26,392
I have read them.

203
00:22:26,417 --> 00:22:36,444
I have read the Sufis of Turkey and also other places.

204
00:22:36,824 --> 00:22:42,337
Even in India we had Sufis, though
they don't call themselves Sufis so much.

205
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:50,848
Sufi means, I don't know what ever you may think it,
but according to Indian understanding

206
00:22:50,966 --> 00:22:56,123
Sufi means 'saaf' and 'saaf' means clean, means pure.

207
00:22:56,183 --> 00:22:59,503
Those who are pure people are Sufis.

208
00:22:59,765 --> 00:23:10,152
In the purity they see nothing
but Divine grace, Divine love, Divine peace.

209
00:23:10,294 --> 00:23:15,077
They talked of peace only; they could not talk of war.

210
00:23:15,325 --> 00:23:25,125
Anybody who talks of war cannot be a person who
has got any right to do that.

211
00:23:27,434 --> 00:23:32,528
War is absolutely like madness.

212
00:23:32,771 --> 00:23:35,650
Even animals won't fight like that.

213
00:23:35,777 --> 00:23:42,006
We are even worse than animals when
we think of war and killing each other.

214
00:23:43,287 --> 00:23:49,274
This should not be done and it has to be stopped completely.

215
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:59,665
Nobody has right to kill anybody unless and until he is attacked.

216
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:10,415
So what we hear about our resurrection
is this - that we are above so many things.

217
00:24:10,721 --> 00:24:16,572
We have lost all those destructive qualities.

218
00:24:16,713 --> 00:24:26,288
As in Sanskrit they call it we have six enemies –
 kama, kroda, mada, mathsarya, loba moha.

219
00:24:26,978 --> 00:24:30,108
Kama means sexual perversion.

220
00:24:30,311 --> 00:24:32,684
Kroda means anger.

221
00:24:33,292 --> 00:24:36,206
Moha means attraction.

222
00:24:36,452 --> 00:24:39,066
Mada means the pride.

223
00:24:39,415 --> 00:24:44,047
Mathsarya means jealously.

224
00:24:44,726 --> 00:24:55,740
All these six things, sixth one is the greed,

225
00:24:56,055 --> 00:25:05,216
all these six things that we had in our mind - out of
our ignorance, out of our upbringing,

226
00:25:05,457 --> 00:25:09,652
out of our reading, whatever it is,

227
00:25:09,771 --> 00:25:15,596
whatever we had developed, we were having - just drops out.

228
00:25:16,718 --> 00:25:23,217
When the Kundalini rises and you become one with the Divine,

229
00:25:23,321 --> 00:25:27,257
then you are on sound grounds.

230
00:25:27,616 --> 00:25:31,572
You realize that you have found the truth

231
00:25:31,778 --> 00:25:37,479
and you no more can enjoy all these destructive habits.

232
00:25:37,741 --> 00:25:40,045
They just drop out.

233
00:25:40,443 --> 00:25:49,353
So you go into a new realm of Divine construction within you.

234
00:25:49,766 --> 00:25:54,045
This is the real resurrection of human beings.

235
00:25:54,982 --> 00:26:03,103
Now, you know that certain subtle things
still remain despite the fact

236
00:26:03,206 --> 00:26:10,079
that people try to destroy the books, to spoil the meaning of things.

237
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:14,870
Despite that, subtle things remain there.

238
00:26:15,427 --> 00:26:23,962
For example we offer eggs during Easter.

239
00:26:24,676 --> 00:26:28,848
What's the meaning of offering eggs?

240
00:26:29,089 --> 00:26:31,650
Why should we offer an egg?

241
00:26:31,978 --> 00:26:40,523
First of all we offer egg because
the egg can go into a transformation.

242
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:44,848
It can become a small chick;

243
00:26:45,082 --> 00:26:50,924
it can be born again.
It’s the egg has the capacity to be born again.

244
00:26:51,116 --> 00:27:00,938
So when you get this egg as a symbol of Easter it means -

245
00:27:01,002 --> 00:27:08,453
you can become a different person, a reformed person

246
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:14,235
and a great spiritual person.
You can become; it means that.

247
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:16,555
Why do we give eggs?

248
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:18,618
People don't know.

249
00:27:18,769 --> 00:27:20,789
I asked so many people.

250
00:27:20,836 --> 00:27:25,763
I asked even some priests who think
they are great authorities of Christianity.

251
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:30,095
They didn't know why they give eggs.

252
00:27:30,705 --> 00:27:42,320
Secondly, if you read the story about
the birth of Shri Ganesh

253
00:27:42,484 --> 00:27:50,251
and then you proceed on, you’ll be surprised is written down
that it was called as Brahmand -

254
00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:58,576
means the egg of the Brahma that came into existence,

255
00:27:58,942 --> 00:28:06,857
and half of it became the Mahavishnu means the Christ,

256
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:13,380
 and half of it remained as Shri Ganesh.

257
00:28:13,721 --> 00:28:23,540
And then it is said that then when Mahavishnu
came out, He started crying for His Father.

258
00:28:23,962 --> 00:28:29,073
Just think of it, He was asking for His Father.

259
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:36,022
Now if you see Christ, He always uses these two fingers.

260
00:28:36,296 --> 00:28:40,253
No other Incarnation has used these two fingers.

261
00:28:40,516 --> 00:28:48,636
This means you know this is the Vishuddhi and this is the Nabhi.

262
00:28:49,546 --> 00:28:59,670
That means He’s talking of His Father who was Nabhi King.

263
00:28:59,695 --> 00:29:03,183
Who's that? You know that very well is the Vishnu,

264
00:29:03,286 --> 00:29:09,161
 and His incarnation as Shri Krishna.

265
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:15,328
So what He’s indicating is this, that - they are My Father.

266
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:17,738
How clearly He does that.

267
00:29:17,826 --> 00:29:24,176
Why not have some other mudras,
other style of holding the fingers?

268
00:29:24,294 --> 00:29:28,967
But He hold always these two fingers, meaning -

269
00:29:29,047 --> 00:29:35,013
My Father the one who was Vishnu and who was Shri Krishna.

270
00:29:36,632 --> 00:29:48,995
And then in the lives of Shri Krishna
they say, “Mahavishnu will be Your Son.”

271
00:29:49,199 --> 00:29:55,166
All these things are not put together as
 I am telling you; separately,

272
00:29:55,248 --> 00:30:03,640
but if you have proper understanding
you can understand the connection between the two -

273
00:30:03,759 --> 00:30:14,952
 that Christ was the son of Shri Vishnu and Shri Krishna

274
00:30:15,412 --> 00:30:24,522
 and that was blessed that
 “You will be the support of the whole universe.”

275
00:30:24,677 --> 00:30:28,526
The support, the adhar of the whole universe, He said it clearly.

276
00:30:28,596 --> 00:30:38,777
It is said so that “You will be supporting the whole universe.”

277
00:30:39,275 --> 00:30:46,163
Now the one half is Shri Ganesh who, is the support in a way;

278
00:30:46,258 --> 00:30:51,428
it supports the Kundalini, it looks after the Kundalini,

279
00:30:51,547 --> 00:30:59,117
 it looks after the chastity of the Mother -

280
00:30:59,348 --> 00:31:08,281
and the another one which is expressed is Jesus Christ,

281
00:31:08,757 --> 00:31:14,265
who is the support of the whole universe.

282
00:31:14,819 --> 00:31:21,800
So naturally it has to be the moral basis

283
00:31:22,023 --> 00:31:28,771
as He is a part and parcel of Shri Ganesha,

284
00:31:28,985 --> 00:31:32,467
it's the moral basis of human beings.

285
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:38,527
On the moral basis only you will be supported;

286
00:31:39,196 --> 00:31:41,889
not all other nonsense that they have,

287
00:31:42,064 --> 00:31:50,746
but a moral basis, and which is missing
in the lives of Christianity.

288
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:56,698
Everything is allowed, very surprising.

289
00:31:57,032 --> 00:32:05,446
You can do whatever you like as long as
you don't take a divorce in the Catholic Church.

290
00:32:05,922 --> 00:32:15,430
And also in the other Church which you can call
non-Catholic Churches, there are many,

291
00:32:15,751 --> 00:32:26,632
even if you are married, you can do whatever you like.

292
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:32,705
Even the Vatican I was told has all these problems.

293
00:32:33,452 --> 00:32:40,342
How can that be if you are the people who think you are baptized?

294
00:32:40,817 --> 00:32:45,727
I mean there's a big celebration of baptism by these priests.

295
00:32:46,033 --> 00:32:50,790
Then where is the Sahasrara and where is the Kundalini

296
00:32:50,836 --> 00:32:53,911
and how do you have your second birth?

297
00:32:54,379 --> 00:32:59,264
There's no second birth, just some priest puts his hand on your head.

298
00:32:59,449 --> 00:33:04,241
Actually it makes a problem for realized souls,

299
00:33:04,424 --> 00:33:09,054
 to put hand of the priest who are not realized souls,

300
00:33:09,427 --> 00:33:12,761
and that creates a problem for children.

301
00:33:12,786 --> 00:33:16,712
I have seen many children they start crying loudly

302
00:33:16,824 --> 00:33:20,922
when they are being blessed by these priests,

303
00:33:21,731 --> 00:33:25,689
because they are realized souls and the priests are not.

304
00:33:25,796 --> 00:33:28,216
It's very interesting.

305
00:33:28,303 --> 00:33:32,570
But they say, “After all you see it's the priests that are bad,

306
00:33:32,614 --> 00:33:37,331
but not Christ.” But how are they related to each other?

307
00:33:37,568 --> 00:33:42,043
Christ stood for morality.

308
00:33:43,812 --> 00:33:51,763
And about Him also in these modern times
they are saying all kinds of filthy things.

309
00:33:52,004 --> 00:34:01,648
They cannot understand a character
which is moral; to this extent we have gone.

310
00:34:03,446 --> 00:34:07,337
Morality is out of question.

311
00:34:07,949 --> 00:34:14,573
You do whatever you like; as long as
you go to church and confess, you’re all right.

312
00:34:15,335 --> 00:34:21,074
These are the absurdities of modern religions.

313
00:34:21,277 --> 00:34:29,552
Every religion has problems and the worst  I feel,
when you have

314
00:34:29,876 --> 00:34:33,759
the support of the world as your leader -

315
00:34:33,879 --> 00:34:41,505
how can you allow people to have such a immoral life?

316
00:34:44,003 --> 00:34:53,472
Immorality how can you tolerate when you follow the example of Christ?

317
00:34:53,931 --> 00:34:57,478
Out of question!

318
00:34:57,829 --> 00:35:02,710
He is the embodiment of morality.

319
00:35:02,854 --> 00:35:10,899
He is Shri Ganesh and how can you allow people

320
00:35:11,368 --> 00:35:15,876
 to come to churches, to the temples,

321
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:21,800
and allow them to have immoral life?

322
00:35:22,221 --> 00:35:26,890
What is the atonement for such people?

323
00:35:27,937 --> 00:35:39,045
The basis of Christ's life, the whole being
of Christ is morality; to establish purity.

324
00:35:41,595 --> 00:35:48,394
Now, it was Shri Ganesha who was created first

325
00:35:48,584 --> 00:35:56,683
by the Adishakti, because She wanted purity around.

326
00:35:58,516 --> 00:36:05,085
She wanted human beings to enjoy their purity

327
00:36:05,164 --> 00:36:14,745
and their personality which was emitting light to others.

328
00:36:15,276 --> 00:36:21,616
If there is impurity say for example on a glass

329
00:36:21,882 --> 00:36:28,923
and if you use that glass on top of the light,
how can the light pass out?

330
00:36:29,581 --> 00:36:37,546
The impure life cannot, cannot give light to others,

331
00:36:37,601 --> 00:36:41,501
 and cannot show your inner light also.

332
00:36:41,565 --> 00:36:49,881
Both things are absolutely true about impurities.

333
00:36:50,495 --> 00:36:54,732
But people say that we have to accept

334
00:36:54,844 --> 00:36:59,875
because if you have to have more people for your religion

335
00:36:59,949 --> 00:37:06,351
you should accept many things, and one of them is impurity.

336
00:37:08,949 --> 00:37:11,287
And just think of it.

337
00:37:11,418 --> 00:37:16,185
Now at the Agnya where Christ resides,

338
00:37:16,455 --> 00:37:22,296
if your eyes are impure, full of lust and greed,

339
00:37:23,067 --> 00:37:31,158
then you are against Christ; you are an antichrist.

340
00:37:32,576 --> 00:37:40,175
If your eyes are clean and pure,

341
00:37:40,499 --> 00:37:49,801
 then only you can enjoy love of God, otherwise you cannot.

342
00:37:50,844 --> 00:37:58,266
And also the love of another Sahaja Yogi or Yogini you can only enjoy

343
00:37:58,349 --> 00:38:03,142
 in completeness if your eyes are clean.

344
00:38:03,229 --> 00:38:05,645
Just imagine.

345
00:38:06,255 --> 00:38:15,946
But if you have roving eyes and all sorts of things, I don't know

346
00:38:16,304 --> 00:38:20,933
 how can you call yourself Christians? You cannot.

347
00:38:21,888 --> 00:38:26,169
Whatever certificate you may carry, but you are not,

348
00:38:26,338 --> 00:38:33,707
 because those who are following Christ
have to have absolutely a moral life.

349
00:38:34,231 --> 00:38:42,237
That's a compulsion of the inner being on you -

350
00:38:42,437 --> 00:38:48,274
that you enjoy your morality

351
00:38:48,783 --> 00:38:56,016
 and you enjoy above all your clean eyes.

352
00:38:57,359 --> 00:39:07,992
This is what I have come to know about the Western life
 that the eyes are not clean.

353
00:39:08,127 --> 00:39:13,031
They’ll go to the church and their eyes will be moving here and there.

354
00:39:13,183 --> 00:39:15,453
How can that be?

355
00:39:15,485 --> 00:39:17,894
How can you do that?

356
00:39:17,919 --> 00:39:24,900
If you think Christ is the one who was resurrected
and you are to be resurrected,

357
00:39:24,976 --> 00:39:31,284
first of all see that you have pure love in your eyes.

358
00:39:31,667 --> 00:39:39,728
Now pure love is not relative, cannot be contaminated,

359
00:39:40,061 --> 00:39:45,267
 cannot have lust and greed in them.

360
00:39:46,842 --> 00:39:52,443
These two things have to drop out from your mind completely.

361
00:39:53,023 --> 00:40:02,499
These are the days of people having greed, lots of greed they have.

362
00:40:04,974 --> 00:40:08,677
I just don't know what sort of things they have because

363
00:40:08,765 --> 00:40:13,023
 I haven't studied so much the immorality of human being.

364
00:40:13,885 --> 00:40:18,431
Whatever I see are beautiful people like you.

365
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:26,591
But when I try to understand the so-called Western culture

366
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:32,350
I am surprised that even if they want to make a life for someone -

367
00:40:32,612 --> 00:40:38,001
 like “The Life of Shakespeare” I saw,
who was according to Me

368
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:46,366
was Avadhoota; means a person who has gone beyond all human

369
00:40:46,657 --> 00:40:54,624
destructive habits, Avadhoot is a very high quality yogi -

370
00:40:54,838 --> 00:41:01,369
and they show him as a stupid man running after a woman.

371
00:41:01,711 --> 00:41:13,531
They cannot conceive of human beings
who could be morally perfect, who will have moral sense.

372
00:41:13,602 --> 00:41:22,270
They cannot conceive, because those
who do this kind of thing are not realized soul.

373
00:41:22,499 --> 00:41:24,860
They are not Sahaja Yogis.

374
00:41:24,963 --> 00:41:30,660
So the conception about morality doesn't come into their head.

375
00:41:30,819 --> 00:41:33,837
They think as we are like that, the others are.

376
00:41:33,890 --> 00:41:38,521
Actually mostly they do it to justify themselves.

377
00:41:38,688 --> 00:41:50,208
So ugly and so horrifying is the depiction
of the character of such great people

378
00:41:50,335 --> 00:41:59,066
who talk such great things, shows that human beings
are really degraded in their value system.

379
00:41:59,199 --> 00:42:07,187
They cannot conceive of somebody who is an ideal personality.

380
00:42:07,546 --> 00:42:16,126
They think by saying so they are talking of something beyond reality.

381
00:42:16,181 --> 00:42:19,146
They don't know reality.

382
00:42:20,653 --> 00:42:24,574
Yesterday’s Sufi thing, I was very impressed

383
00:42:24,599 --> 00:42:27,918
when they said about the four stages that you have.

384
00:42:29,076 --> 00:42:33,785
And out of that the Haakikat - means the reality,

385
00:42:34,087 --> 00:42:38,642
you have to get into the reality.

386
00:42:39,493 --> 00:42:41,695
Reality is what?

387
00:42:42,107 --> 00:42:45,188
It’s not a perception.

388
00:42:45,371 --> 00:42:50,917
It's not seeing something, but it’s being something.

389
00:42:53,458 --> 00:43:00,509
If you start seeing, you might see something
white, red, yellow but you are not that.

390
00:43:00,722 --> 00:43:09,766
When you are, you are the reality,
then you emit reality,

391
00:43:10,083 --> 00:43:15,951
you see reality, you enjoy reality, you live in reality.

392
00:43:16,126 --> 00:43:21,237
This is real life and you don't indulge into

393
00:43:21,301 --> 00:43:28,582
something which is unreal, imaginary or below dignity.

394
00:43:28,607 --> 00:43:30,153
No you don't do it.

395
00:43:30,256 --> 00:43:35,361
You are the reality, is the Haakikat, as they say.

396
00:43:35,437 --> 00:43:41,894
You are the reality and you are emitting reality

397
00:43:41,950 --> 00:43:49,360
 in your behavior, in your talks, in your lives, in everything.

398
00:43:51,939 --> 00:44:01,629
All this brings forth the greatest force of spirituality.

399
00:44:04,508 --> 00:44:12,933
Whatever is falsehood, whatever is wrong, whatever is destructive,

400
00:44:13,465 --> 00:44:19,709
 will run away from a man who stands in reality; is automatic.

401
00:44:22,027 --> 00:44:26,928
It is absolutely part and parcel

402
00:44:27,134 --> 00:44:32,440
of the same personality who is supposed to be a realized soul.

403
00:44:32,985 --> 00:44:38,604
So the resurrection has taken place no doubt - all right.

404
00:44:38,857 --> 00:44:41,427
Your hands are speaking - all right.

405
00:44:41,586 --> 00:44:53,331
I don't want to give you any command or
any kind of a fixed road that you have to follow.

406
00:44:53,652 --> 00:44:57,902
Now you are free, because you have the light.

407
00:44:58,004 --> 00:45:00,987
When you have the light why should I tell you which way to go?

408
00:45:01,012 --> 00:45:10,002
You know yourself that you have the light,
so you follow yourself in a way

409
00:45:10,097 --> 00:45:15,450
 that is an enlightened path, with your own light.

410
00:45:15,577 --> 00:45:19,607
Don’t somebody has to tell you
hat don't do this, don't do, nothing of the kind.

411
00:45:19,790 --> 00:45:25,056
You want just do it, if something wrong
 you will not do; if you are doing it

412
00:45:25,090 --> 00:45:31,125
then know that you have to still rise above all this thing.

413
00:45:31,728 --> 00:45:37,719
You are the Nabhis that are described in the Koran.

414
00:45:37,959 --> 00:45:43,290
You are the ones who are going to resurrect the whole world.

415
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:50,782
You are the ones who are going to help the downtrodden people

416
00:45:50,918 --> 00:45:56,428
into the filth of immorality. Your life should show.

417
00:45:56,555 --> 00:46:05,639
Look at these few of these people who were Sufis,

418
00:46:05,830 --> 00:46:13,058
who were very clean people, how have they been able to channelize

419
00:46:13,415 --> 00:46:16,616
 the other people into a better life?

420
00:46:17,411 --> 00:46:19,826
That is what you are.

421
00:46:19,989 --> 00:46:25,484
You have to channelize their lives; that's your job.

422
00:46:25,606 --> 00:46:33,366
Don't think about what is happening,
how the people are stupid, immoral, forget it.

423
00:46:33,621 --> 00:46:36,431
What you have to know what you are.

424
00:46:36,519 --> 00:46:44,040
You have to be aware of yourself
and of your responsibility as being the purest of pure.

425
00:46:44,415 --> 00:46:49,066
As my name is indicates, you are My children,

426
00:46:49,165 --> 00:46:54,982
and that indicates the children of Nirmal, means purity.

427
00:46:55,217 --> 00:47:00,977
Purity is the basis of your existence.

428
00:47:01,833 --> 00:47:07,966
You should try to see where, what you were, in which part.

429
00:47:08,238 --> 00:47:13,867
There’s no mistake in appreciating the art,

430
00:47:14,026 --> 00:47:20,446
appreciating all that is beautiful, appreciating all

431
00:47:21,216 --> 00:47:25,653
that is created out of beautiful minds,

432
00:47:25,756 --> 00:47:30,554
but there should be no lust and greed in that appreciation.

433
00:47:30,849 --> 00:47:36,364
Pure appreciation, purity is the message,

434
00:47:36,418 --> 00:47:41,946
and once you have the purity within yourself you will love yourself.

435
00:47:42,221 --> 00:47:45,570
As I love you, you will love you also.

436
00:47:45,618 --> 00:47:52,472
And then you will understand this word love
which comes out of the purity.

437
00:47:52,759 --> 00:48:01,907
The blossoming of your purity,
the fragrance of your purity, you enjoy all the time

438
00:48:02,048 --> 00:48:08,050
and the love that you have flows,

439
00:48:08,161 --> 00:48:14,811
 flows towards all those who are to be loved,
who have to be looked after.

440
00:48:15,128 --> 00:48:21,417
Don’t worry about the people who are destructive.

441
00:48:21,586 --> 00:48:26,612
That's the only word I can use,
because there are so many things one can say about.

442
00:48:26,811 --> 00:48:32,001
Let them be destructive because they are destroying themselves.

443
00:48:32,102 --> 00:48:34,683
Why should we worry about them?

444
00:48:34,754 --> 00:48:37,196
They think they are destroying others but they are not,

445
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:42,011
they are destroying themselves.
So forget about it, just forget.

446
00:48:42,164 --> 00:48:51,866
You think yourself to be responsible for the construction
of the whole world,

447
00:48:51,933 --> 00:48:54,653
 it's not only a few people.

448
00:48:54,971 --> 00:48:59,694
You are very intelligent, knowledgeable and understanding.

449
00:48:59,789 --> 00:49:04,405
You are not like the Disciples of Christ who were not educated,

450
00:49:04,432 --> 00:49:12,327
who didn't understand so much and
who did get realization but were not of your level.

451
00:49:12,981 --> 00:49:21,152
Whatever they could do reached to a point
where this kind of a mess of a Christianity has come,

452
00:49:21,556 --> 00:49:24,488
but you can't create that kind.

453
00:49:24,572 --> 00:49:34,595
You will create a new vibrant religion which is global.

454
00:49:34,816 --> 00:49:41,108
I was very happy to see that now
we have people from all over the world.

455
00:49:41,354 --> 00:49:43,980
It’s a global movement all over.

456
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:51,559
It has nothing to do with the limited ideas of so called religions.

457
00:49:51,845 --> 00:49:54,956
They have ruined every religion.

458
00:49:54,995 --> 00:50:03,220
Islam is ruined, Christianity ruined,
and Hinduism ruined, and Buddhism the worst.

459
00:50:03,733 --> 00:50:06,763
In Buddhism you give up everything -

460
00:50:06,938 --> 00:50:14,216
all your belongings, all your property, give to the guru, imagine!

461
00:50:14,645 --> 00:50:22,133
And the guru is so greedy horrible fellow.

462
00:50:22,972 --> 00:50:29,528
How can he give resurrection?
Himself is a greedy fellow,

463
00:50:29,743 --> 00:50:35,606
misleading others just taking away everything.

464
00:50:36,633 --> 00:50:40,194
Then same thing about Christianity

465
00:50:40,297 --> 00:50:43,300
that you all become Nuns,
 you become Fathers, you become

466
00:50:43,325 --> 00:50:47,078
Brothers and I don’t know, all nonsense.

467
00:50:47,335 --> 00:50:50,855
But there's no change within.

468
00:50:52,156 --> 00:50:58,265
Somebody came to Me and I said, “Why did you become a priest?”

469
00:50:58,354 --> 00:51:01,064
He said, “Because I was jobless.

470
00:51:02,421 --> 00:51:04,166
I had no job.”

471
00:51:04,166 --> 00:51:05,166
Baba?

472
00:51:05,166 --> 00:51:07,608
“So I took up the job of a priest.”

473
00:51:07,687 --> 00:51:09,147
Can you imagine?

474
00:51:09,785 --> 00:51:16,712
He could not fit into any job, so the minimum of minimum
he took is this job.

475
00:51:17,039 --> 00:51:19,269
Then what did you do?

476
00:51:19,443 --> 00:51:25,913
“They told me what I have to preach and first I had to practice

477
00:51:26,331 --> 00:51:30,823
and remember it by heart, and then I don't know,

478
00:51:30,947 --> 00:51:37,859
I started talking this, talking that.”
I said he must be a big possessed man.

479
00:51:38,026 --> 00:51:43,495
He had no mind of his own; he didn't know what he was talking.

480
00:51:43,630 --> 00:51:50,296
He would take out one sentence from Bible
and go on talking, boring everybody.

481
00:51:50,477 --> 00:51:57,708
And I was surprised that within fifteen minutes
people wanted to get out of the church.

482
00:51:58,074 --> 00:52:05,581
As soon as the sermon was over they would run out
and breathe, “Thank God.”

483
00:52:06,335 --> 00:52:10,318
Is that what religion gives you?

484
00:52:10,533 --> 00:52:13,186
Is that what should happen to you?

485
00:52:13,305 --> 00:52:16,189
No, it's not that.

486
00:52:16,333 --> 00:52:22,496
What happens to you that
you enjoy yourself, you enjoy the collectivity,

487
00:52:22,521 --> 00:52:24,795
you enjoy the goodness, the morality.

488
00:52:24,795 --> 00:52:30,878
The whole thing is like the nectar of life.

489
00:52:32,057 --> 00:52:36,616
So that changes the whole picture.

490
00:52:37,163 --> 00:52:43,916
The ritualism is so much; in the Hindu religion
there is too much of ritualism.

491
00:52:44,173 --> 00:52:51,670
You sit on the right or you sit on the left;
you do this at this time I mean, lots of it.

492
00:52:51,834 --> 00:52:56,668
That when your sister dies how many days you should starve yourself;

493
00:52:56,693 --> 00:53:00,085
if your husband dies then how many days?

494
00:53:01,019 --> 00:53:06,407
Dies is died, finished; the body’s finished now.

495
00:53:06,778 --> 00:53:11,129
So you fast for so many days - is very wrong,

496
00:53:11,154 --> 00:53:14,840
because you’re fasting the bhoot might come in to you.

497
00:53:17,846 --> 00:53:23,589
But still, what I would say all these ritualisms and all that,

498
00:53:23,729 --> 00:53:32,181
are created by human beings
who were claiming to be something great.

499
00:53:32,369 --> 00:53:39,493
They are not; by no means they are the people in charge of morality,

500
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:44,483
 in charge of higher life.

501
00:53:45,054 --> 00:53:50,597
They lead such a mundane useless life.

502
00:53:52,682 --> 00:53:55,876
I went to a temple of Shri Ganesha,

503
00:53:55,960 --> 00:54:02,000
which is supposed to be Swayambhu,
one of the eight temples; it is one of them.

504
00:54:05,270 --> 00:54:06,977
And I was surprised.

505
00:54:07,002 --> 00:54:16,225
The man who was worshipping was supposed to be the priest,
he was suffering from paralysis,

506
00:54:16,799 --> 00:54:24,319
and his brother died of paralysis, now his son was also paralyzed.

507
00:54:24,605 --> 00:54:27,733
He said, “What is this Ganesha doing to us Mother?”

508
00:54:27,758 --> 00:54:31,268
I said, “What are you doing to Ganesha?

509
00:54:31,530 --> 00:54:35,540
How much money you earn out of it?”

510
00:54:35,643 --> 00:54:38,252
He said, “Quite a lot.”

511
00:54:38,514 --> 00:54:40,769
“And then what do you do with this money?

512
00:54:40,794 --> 00:54:43,638
Do you do anything for the society?

513
00:54:43,663 --> 00:54:46,188
Do you try to improve their lives?

514
00:54:46,213 --> 00:54:52,750
Have you any attention on the society
or you are just ooking after yourself?”

515
00:54:52,905 --> 00:54:59,377
As a result, he’s got paralysis,
 his brother got paralysis, son got paralysis.

516
00:54:59,776 --> 00:55:03,422
And he was blaming Ganesha for that.

517
00:55:03,922 --> 00:55:08,664
He said, “Is it a real Ganesha?”
“Yes it is, but you are not.

518
00:55:08,974 --> 00:55:12,050
You don't deserve.”
I told him off on his face.

519
00:55:12,193 --> 00:55:15,624
He said, “All right you may say whatever you like but You cure me.”

520
00:55:15,743 --> 00:55:21,011
I said, “First promise that whatever money you get out of this temple

521
00:55:21,036 --> 00:55:25,855
you will spend it for the betterment of people.”

522
00:55:26,814 --> 00:55:29,845
But how can they?

523
00:55:31,289 --> 00:55:33,669
They are not realized souls.

524
00:55:33,772 --> 00:55:39,042
Such a lot of priests I see walking about with all this funny dresses.

525
00:55:39,082 --> 00:55:40,082
What?

526
00:55:40,273 --> 00:55:47,402
These are like dead bodies,
walking around with all kinds bad vibrations.

527
00:55:48,228 --> 00:55:50,423
I can't understand.

528
00:55:50,691 --> 00:55:56,651
And the other people are very simple,
they say, "Oh my goodness, see now he’s a priest."

529
00:55:56,850 --> 00:55:58,723
So they must respect.

530
00:55:58,748 --> 00:56:02,460
But, they don't see it; they do not ascertain

531
00:56:02,485 --> 00:56:10,085
what is the spiritual value of that person
who calls himself as the priest.

532
00:56:11,499 --> 00:56:13,629
That is your job.

533
00:56:13,732 --> 00:56:15,351
You don't have to fight with them.

534
00:56:15,376 --> 00:56:17,225
You don't have to denounce them.

535
00:56:17,225 --> 00:56:20,346
You don't have to describe them.

536
00:56:20,346 --> 00:56:24,186
No need, but understand that you are different.

537
00:56:24,186 --> 00:56:28,061
You have the right. You are the authority

538
00:56:28,275 --> 00:56:31,430
 and so with that authority and confidence

539
00:56:31,455 --> 00:56:34,525
 you have to go about and save people.

540
00:56:34,525 --> 00:56:37,974
You are realized souls.

541
00:56:38,127 --> 00:56:40,828
You got your resurrection.

542
00:56:40,860 --> 00:56:46,890
You are yogis; I agree, but what is your job?

543
00:56:47,176 --> 00:56:49,567
Why, why this has happened?

544
00:56:49,654 --> 00:56:56,447
Why this light has come in to you is to take the blind

545
00:56:57,106 --> 00:57:02,387
in your hands and take them towards the light.

546
00:57:02,625 --> 00:57:06,502
This is what is your resurrection for.

547
00:57:06,677 --> 00:57:16,012
It's not only for your seeking but also is the grace of the Divine,

548
00:57:16,126 --> 00:57:21,194
for you to make the whole world Divine, as far as possible.

549
00:57:21,279 --> 00:57:24,218
How many people have you given realization?

550
00:57:24,298 --> 00:57:26,332
How many people you have talked to them?

551
00:57:26,357 --> 00:57:29,759
I tell you I was surprised; once I was traveling by plane

552
00:57:29,879 --> 00:57:33,403
 and there was some lady traveling with Me

553
00:57:33,428 --> 00:57:38,351
and she started talking to Me about her cult, about her nonsense.

554
00:57:38,376 --> 00:57:42,008
So look at it, shamelessly she was talking.

555
00:57:42,285 --> 00:57:47,833
Listening to her I said, Sahaja Yogis won't,
 they won't talk about Sahaja Yoga.

556
00:57:48,060 --> 00:57:53,824
Every person who is a Sahaja Yogi has to talk about Sahaja Yoga,

557
00:57:54,014 --> 00:57:58,342
may not be with the wrong type but with the right type of people.

558
00:57:58,854 --> 00:58:03,236
That's a thing you have to do. That's why you are enlightened.

559
00:58:03,603 --> 00:58:08,389
You are not enlightened to be put somewhere in the forest

560
00:58:08,897 --> 00:58:11,832
or to be lost to the whole world.

561
00:58:11,857 --> 00:58:17,706
You are enlightened; you are resurrected to enlighten other people.

562
00:58:17,816 --> 00:58:21,145
That's what you are there for

563
00:58:21,709 --> 00:58:24,299
and you can do it. Many have done it.

564
00:58:24,340 --> 00:58:26,661
So many of you have done it,

565
00:58:26,716 --> 00:58:33,310
and I would say that all of you, whether
 you are a man or a woman, you have to do it.

566
00:58:34,993 --> 00:58:45,456
And that's the request of your Mother - t
hat make use of your realization.

567
00:58:46,094 --> 00:58:52,559
And the attention should be only on realization.

568
00:58:52,944 --> 00:58:58,097
How many people you are going to give realization to?

569
00:58:58,334 --> 00:59:02,221
How many people you are going to save?

570
00:59:03,102 --> 00:59:06,166
Is a very simple job for you.

571
00:59:06,223 --> 00:59:08,204
You have to just raise the Kundalini.

572
00:59:08,302 --> 00:59:09,352
You can.

573
00:59:09,495 --> 00:59:14,011
You should see how just with your hand
you can raise the Kundalini of others

574
00:59:14,036 --> 00:59:16,716
 and give them their resurrection.

575
00:59:17,118 --> 00:59:19,364
You don't have to do anything.

576
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:22,633
The life is not that difficult for you.

577
00:59:22,672 --> 00:59:26,831
Your job is the easiest thing; it’s just to raise your hand.

578
00:59:26,856 --> 00:59:29,307
In hand, in your hand you have the power,

579
00:59:29,382 --> 00:59:38,185
 just to raise your hand and give them realization,
instead of feeling diffident.

580
00:59:39,582 --> 00:59:44,100
That's why I would say you are all resurrected,

581
00:59:44,188 --> 00:59:47,041
you are all realized souls,

582
00:59:47,209 --> 00:59:51,278
and you have to create the Divine paradise on this earth.
