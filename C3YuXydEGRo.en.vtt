00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:35.709
It’s so very joyous to see you all here
assembled together.

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:45.329
I’ve to thank you very much for getting
such a nice place as this Shudy Camp; I’ve

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:54.749
given it a new name, Shoody Camp meaning cleansing
camp

00:02:54.749 --> 00:02:56.969
which is such an ancient building.

00:02:56.969 --> 00:03:13.648
It has gone through various stages of history
and has kept the mark of all these times and

00:03:13.648 --> 00:03:26.558
now you have to build up the future on this
land, on this spot, in this building.

00:03:26.558 --> 00:03:36.629
Also I’m thankful to you for buying such
a nice comfortable car for Me.

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:39.409
I thought I was supposed to buy but everybody
said, “No, we are supposed to buy it for

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:41.019
You, Mother.”

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:52.259
This is the first house that is in My name,
first house I own and this is the first car

00:03:52.259 --> 00:04:02.729
I have owned in My name.

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:16.559
I’m so proud that My children have bought
it for Me.

00:04:16.559 --> 00:04:28.459
They have, with their love and affection have
bought this huge big place as well as the

00:04:28.459 --> 00:04:39.769
car for My dwelling as well as for My comfort.

00:04:39.769 --> 00:04:58.389
When we come on this earth, when the incarnations
descend they don’t need a building at all;

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:12.489
they have a dwelling that’s (inaudible) face
the sky and the clouds are the curtains and

00:05:12.489 --> 00:05:22.639
grass is their bed and all the directions
are the worms.

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:31.438
But when they reside in the heart of their
children, in the heart of their bhaktas, the

00:05:31.438 --> 00:06:08.518
heart of their devotees, then these beautiful
hearts create something so artistic

00:06:08.518 --> 00:06:27.658
and then re-creates according to his own
expression of love.

00:06:27.658 --> 00:06:42.139
This is what you have done by buying this
house and by buying this car, amen.

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:51.028
I don’t need any conveyance, you know that.

00:06:51.028 --> 00:07:01.969
But in the modern times the conveyance has
changed.

00:07:01.969 --> 00:07:26.259
It started with a little mouse, changing into
a car, maybe an aeroplane.

00:07:26.259 --> 00:07:39.969
But actually what is My conveyance is?

00:07:39.969 --> 00:07:53.028
My conveyance is your heart, only through
your heart I can be carried.

00:07:53.028 --> 00:08:02.509
There’s no other way out.

00:08:02.509 --> 00:08:16.439
Your sincerity, your devotion, your love,
that can only carry your Mother and this is

00:08:16.439 --> 00:08:26.569
a symbol of that.

00:08:26.569 --> 00:08:33.409
Matter has only one facility that you can
express your heart through these material

00:08:33.409 --> 00:08:35.409
things.

00:08:35.409 --> 00:08:53.039
Your nobility, your graciousness, your generosity
is expressed through matter.

00:08:53.039 --> 00:09:06.489
I do that Myself and now you have done it
this time; I’m thankful to you.

00:09:06.489 --> 00:09:21.278
As you know very well that I cannot be contained
into anything, neither in this house, neither

00:09:21.278 --> 00:09:27.409
in England nor in India, nor in the whole
universe.

00:09:27.409 --> 00:09:38.229
I’m rather too large, but of course in your
heart, I can.

00:09:38.229 --> 00:09:45.259
And that is how your heart should be.

00:09:45.259 --> 00:10:04.019
For Me, a comfortable place like a lotus to
relax, to realize My own love.

00:10:04.019 --> 00:10:30.789
When all these things happen, so much adoration
is poured on your Mother you just get boundless;

00:10:30.789 --> 00:11:01.599
you spread out, you reach such spots in the
whole of humanity, everywhere I can feel the

00:11:01.599 --> 00:11:16.279
worship, the enjoyment of millions of millions
who died before, who are there and who will

00:11:16.279 --> 00:11:19.119
be there.

00:11:19.119 --> 00:11:52.559
All this expands you into a very subtle sensibility
of feeling every suffering soul, every tortured

00:11:52.559 --> 00:12:10.659
person, every unhappy being, every seeker,
every Sahaja Yogi all over the world.

00:12:10.659 --> 00:12:16.369
In you I see their reflection.

00:12:16.369 --> 00:12:26.079
In the same way you all have to expand, expand
yourself, that’s very important for England.

00:12:26.079 --> 00:12:37.448
As I said, England is the heart and the spirit
resides in the heart but spirit moves out

00:12:37.448 --> 00:12:44.099
of the heart sometimes, it does.

00:12:44.099 --> 00:12:54.769
And is reflected through the soul and recently
I told in Italy that Italy is the soul.

00:12:54.769 --> 00:13:03.049
That’s why you have to go by a special plane
to Italy to reflect.

00:13:03.049 --> 00:13:06.179
But now Italians have come here.

00:13:06.179 --> 00:13:13.399
The soul had to come to the spirit.

00:13:13.399 --> 00:13:18.619
So let us not be materialistic, for a change.

00:13:18.619 --> 00:13:42.209
Let us not be mundane but work out your spiritual
hankering through its fulfillment.

00:13:42.209 --> 00:13:55.859
You have seen, so many in India, Ajanta, which
was built in eleven centuries, which is built

00:13:55.859 --> 00:14:07.419
in a range of half-circular mountains.

00:14:07.419 --> 00:14:17.758
The stones were hewed from top to bottom and
the height of some of these is more than eighty

00:14:17.758 --> 00:14:25.888
feet, the caves and in eleven centuries how
they worked it out, that first they made a

00:14:25.888 --> 00:14:27.818
general plan of it.

00:14:27.818 --> 00:14:36.448
Then they made the division of it, like that
it went on till it came to the detailed working.

00:14:36.448 --> 00:14:45.959
Generations after generations, in the praise
of Lord Buddha whom they had not seen, they

00:14:45.959 --> 00:14:50.619
had never known, only in dedication to Him.

00:14:50.619 --> 00:15:01.979
They worked in that jungle, in that forest,
day in and day out, for eleven centuries to

00:15:01.979 --> 00:15:10.579
build that Ajanta where even their names are
not there; no one knows who were responsible,

00:15:10.579 --> 00:15:13.119
who did it.

00:15:13.119 --> 00:15:20.739
Without leaving any traces, just for their
emancipation, of expression of their adoration

00:15:20.739 --> 00:15:31.459
for Lord Buddha because He talked of self-realization;
only talked, didn’t give.

00:15:31.459 --> 00:15:39.419
For eleven generations or may be more because
in one century there are at least two generations;

00:15:39.419 --> 00:15:45.448
maybe twenty-one generations worked, one after
another to build that huge thing of seven

00:15:45.448 --> 00:15:49.239
miles.

00:15:49.239 --> 00:16:00.359
And the whole thing is so smooth, like this,
like the tent that the roof is extremely smooth,

00:16:00.359 --> 00:16:12.138
as if a tent has been put up, and even there
is this kind of a looseness, that you can

00:16:12.138 --> 00:16:29.739
see in this tent and when the wind blows,
how the cloth goes into folds with all the

00:16:29.739 --> 00:16:35.448
beautiful paintings on them, is shown.

00:16:35.448 --> 00:16:42.359
What was it that made it?

00:16:42.359 --> 00:16:45.928
Who was the one who guided them?

00:16:45.928 --> 00:16:57.419
They had never seen Buddha.

00:16:57.419 --> 00:17:03.649
We have got realization, we’re much higher
people than all of them.

00:17:03.649 --> 00:17:09.469
We have much more capacities.

00:17:09.469 --> 00:17:17.839
Now in Delhi they have discovered that Sahaja
Yogis have a greater resistance for digestion,

00:17:17.839 --> 00:17:24.679
skin resistance and when they’re in thoughtless
awareness there are no electrical charges

00:17:24.679 --> 00:17:26.359
in the brain.

00:17:26.359 --> 00:17:39.649
So their brains are preserved and are going
to be very dynamic for a long time.

00:17:39.649 --> 00:17:52.909
It’s going to be published on the eighth
of this month.

00:17:52.909 --> 00:18:04.219
So one has to know that we are born in a very
dynamic time, historical times.

00:18:04.219 --> 00:18:12.859
Never before in history we had so many Sahaja
Yogis.

00:18:12.859 --> 00:18:20.589
This is the time of the greatest revolution,
greatest evolution

00:18:20.589 --> 00:18:28.989
and this is the time you’re going to achieve
something that was never achieved before.

00:18:28.989 --> 00:18:38.758
Are we capable of calling ourselves Sahaja
Yogis?

00:18:38.758 --> 00:18:48.219
August is a very great month, specially for
Me.

00:18:48.219 --> 00:18:52.779
Today is also a very great day, I should say.

00:18:52.779 --> 00:19:02.709
In the month of August, we got our independence,
as you know, ninth of August, in India.

00:19:02.709 --> 00:19:14.479
But before that, in 1942, on the third of
August, Mahatma Gandhi declared the movement

00:19:14.479 --> 00:19:20.599
of “Quit India,” of the British from India.

00:19:20.599 --> 00:19:47.029
And today on the same day you have welcomed
Me in the heart of the heart, Shoody Camp.

00:19:47.029 --> 00:20:16.509
Eighth of August, as you know, is the day
when Rabindranath Tagore was born and in our

00:20:16.509 --> 00:20:23.709
college we celebrated eighth of August and
I remember it very clearly.

00:20:23.709 --> 00:20:40.469
And the ninth
of August we all went on a strike.

00:20:40.469 --> 00:20:49.749
In science college I remember I was a young
girl of nineteen years and My professsor and

00:20:49.749 --> 00:20:55.059
My principal still remember all those things
that happened.

00:20:55.059 --> 00:21:01.009
I was standing alone and behind Me were all
the students who were doing the strike.

00:21:01.009 --> 00:21:07.259
When the military came in and they tried to
threaten and do all kinds of things to Me.

00:21:07.259 --> 00:21:10.649
I said, “No, we’ll not enter into the
college, today is the strike day.”

00:21:10.649 --> 00:21:15.449
When My principal came and he was very happy
and they removed him for that.

00:21:15.449 --> 00:21:22.469
He has written a very nice letter to Me when
he met Me the other day, when he saw Me as

00:21:22.469 --> 00:21:23.799
Mataji Nirmala Devi.

00:21:23.799 --> 00:21:28.999
It was a letter worth really remembering.

00:21:28.999 --> 00:21:36.949
So this is the month of a very big change
and revolution in India.

00:21:36.949 --> 00:21:47.009
But with that one has to remember that “Quit
India” movement started all right and all

00:21:47.009 --> 00:21:55.369
kinds of sacrifices were done, people sacrificed
so much that you cannot imagine how much people

00:21:55.369 --> 00:21:57.209
have to sacrifice.

00:21:57.209 --> 00:22:04.889
As today in South Africa, people are sacrificing
so much for their freedom, much worse than

00:22:04.889 --> 00:22:08.839
in India, much worse.

00:22:08.839 --> 00:22:11.419
People sacrificed and sacrificed.

00:22:11.419 --> 00:22:21.719
As a result of those sacrifices, we got our
independence and we have to thank the Labour

00:22:21.719 --> 00:22:23.329
government for that.

00:22:23.329 --> 00:22:32.759
If Mr. Attlee was not chosen by the Divine
we would never have got our independence.

00:22:32.759 --> 00:22:39.829
We got our independence and graciously English
left us, that was something really great of

00:22:39.829 --> 00:22:43.839
them, in those days to do it.

00:22:43.839 --> 00:22:52.168
But that independence was just a political
independence, political freedom but today

00:22:52.168 --> 00:22:58.649
you have the ultimate, ultimate freedom.

00:22:58.649 --> 00:23:06.139
You got the freedom of your spirit which is
not attached to anything, which is not anything

00:23:06.139 --> 00:23:13.908
but the spirit, which is absolute, which is
neither English nor Indian nor Australian,

00:23:13.908 --> 00:23:22.089
which is not this house, which is not anything
but the spirit itself, the complete freedom

00:23:22.089 --> 00:23:24.319
you’ve got.

00:23:24.319 --> 00:23:27.059
In that freedom you have to rise.

00:23:27.059 --> 00:23:37.139
Still we have considerations of brothers,
sisters, children, wife; no, you are the spirit.

00:23:37.139 --> 00:23:38.139
You have to sacrifice.

00:23:38.139 --> 00:23:43.839
For Me, nothing is like sacrificing because
I don’t know what am I sacrificing.

00:23:43.839 --> 00:23:59.299
In the same way what we call sacrifice at
that stage should be Sahaj now for us, Sahaj.

00:23:59.299 --> 00:24:04.109
That time it was a sacrifice but today it
should be Sahaj.

00:24:04.109 --> 00:24:07.969
We’ve gained so much in Sahaja Yoga.

00:24:07.969 --> 00:24:12.129
In that freedom fight, they gained nothing.

00:24:12.129 --> 00:24:15.629
But what are we sacrificing?

00:24:15.629 --> 00:24:25.249
Just our ego and this is what English have
to come up to.

00:24:25.249 --> 00:24:30.179
“What have I sacrificed for Sahaja Yoga?

00:24:30.179 --> 00:24:32.929
What have I done for Sahaja Yoga?

00:24:32.929 --> 00:24:34.639
How much I have exploited it?”

00:24:34.639 --> 00:24:40.369
We must think it over; it’s very important.

00:24:40.369 --> 00:24:48.969
You left an empire; India was the gem.

00:24:48.969 --> 00:24:54.439
On that earning you are still having your
doles today.

00:24:54.439 --> 00:25:00.439
Such a rich country you left, richest of all
in the whole world was India.

00:25:00.439 --> 00:25:09.609
You don’t know how rich India was and is
today even if you see to it.

00:25:09.609 --> 00:25:13.069
And you left that country, you are a small
country.

00:25:13.069 --> 00:25:22.629
You don’t have any riches as such, nothing,
but in your greatness you left it.

00:25:22.629 --> 00:25:26.119
Nobody will leave like that.

00:25:26.119 --> 00:25:27.589
Your forefathers did it.

00:25:27.589 --> 00:25:39.689
It’s a great sacrifice I think, from the
worldly point of view.

00:25:39.689 --> 00:25:46.499
So we have to now understand that, we must
have confidence in ourselves in such a way

00:25:46.499 --> 00:25:51.139
that whatever we sacrifice, what do we sacrifice?

00:25:51.139 --> 00:25:57.849
In this maya you sacrifice something and how
much you get out of it.

00:25:57.849 --> 00:26:01.139
Just the maya is testing you.

00:26:01.139 --> 00:26:16.049
So for today you have sacrificed a lot, given
lot of money to have this house, and I know

00:26:16.049 --> 00:26:17.049
that.

00:26:17.049 --> 00:26:22.329
You’ll be amazed I’m not worried about
My own money, how much it is spent here and

00:26:22.329 --> 00:26:23.329
there.

00:26:23.329 --> 00:26:30.879
But for your money I’m very hard on all
of them and the leaders might be thinking

00:26:30.879 --> 00:26:39.589
I’m so miserly but this is public money,
not only public, this is the blood of My children.

00:26:39.589 --> 00:26:52.819
So again on this great occasion, this joyous
occasion, in the month of August we’re having

00:26:52.819 --> 00:27:02.289
this beautiful place now and with this one
we’ll have many in future.

00:27:02.289 --> 00:27:11.219
I hope we’ll occupy the whole place quite
a lot.

00:27:11.219 --> 00:27:23.788
Already the neighbors must have run away

00:27:23.788 --> 00:27:35.979
and we’re going to manage somehow or other
to purchase all these places here.

00:27:35.979 --> 00:27:38.388
You have to desire it.

00:27:38.388 --> 00:27:48.149
Behind every desire there has to be the action
and in that action you have to sacrifice.

00:27:48.149 --> 00:27:54.059
But if you say it laboriously, “I’m sacrificing,
sacrificing,” it’s not a divine thing

00:27:54.059 --> 00:27:59.429
to do, should be done in such a joyous way.

00:27:59.429 --> 00:28:11.509
I hope now, today you will all promise Me
that every morning you’re going to meditate,

00:28:11.509 --> 00:28:17.329
every morning, everyone, no excuses, you’re
not going to excuse yourself.

00:28:17.329 --> 00:28:23.439
Unless and until you meditate I cannot do
what I want to do in Shoody Camp.

00:28:23.439 --> 00:28:32.169
No laziness, no excuses, no telling lies,
not deceiving yourself; all of you are going

00:28:32.169 --> 00:28:38.288
to meditate, that is one promise.

00:28:38.288 --> 00:28:46.949
And the rest I’ll look after, the rest I
will look after.

00:28:46.949 --> 00:28:55.908
You’ll just decide to meditate everyday,
everyday.

00:28:55.908 --> 00:29:03.289
That’s one more thing you have to give Me
is the promise that you will all meditate

00:29:03.289 --> 00:29:09.969
everyday in the morning time and evening time
if you do foot-soaking is good for you, not

00:29:09.969 --> 00:29:12.658
for Me.

00:29:12.658 --> 00:29:26.869
Everything’s so spontaneous, so beautiful,
how it has worked out.

00:29:26.869 --> 00:29:32.589
Now to end it up I’ll give you a very good
example of manifestation of another miracle

00:29:32.589 --> 00:29:37.839
that has taken place, how it works out.

00:29:37.839 --> 00:29:42.999
You know we have bought a plot of land of
forty-two acres in Vaitarna for the education

00:29:42.999 --> 00:29:45.599
of children.

00:29:45.599 --> 00:29:57.249
And the Bombay people went there and planted
some three hundred trees and also they had

00:29:57.249 --> 00:30:02.209
a paddy farming started there.

00:30:02.209 --> 00:30:06.339
Before the school starts they thought something
should be done about it.

00:30:06.339 --> 00:30:10.989
But the villagers around would bring their
cattle, their cows, and their goats and all

00:30:10.989 --> 00:30:14.908
of them to graze in that ground.

00:30:14.908 --> 00:30:19.559
So they got very much worried and the Sahaja
Yogis in Vaitarna also said that, “You shouldn’t

00:30:19.559 --> 00:30:22.179
this, this is Mother’s land.”

00:30:22.179 --> 00:30:27.359
Again they had a meeting of the villagers,
they told, “This is Mother’s land, you

00:30:27.359 --> 00:30:29.959
better not come here.”

00:30:29.959 --> 00:30:33.219
They wouldn’t listen to them.

00:30:33.219 --> 00:30:41.819
And one day suddenly in the daytime a very
big tiger appeared, very big tiger, of a very

00:30:41.819 --> 00:30:43.268
large size.

00:30:43.268 --> 00:30:50.349
And he started roaring and jumping all over,
running all over the place whatever we had

00:30:50.349 --> 00:30:52.388
purchased and all that.

00:30:52.388 --> 00:30:59.049
And everyday he did it for five days and they
got such a fright that they took away their

00:30:59.049 --> 00:31:04.138
lock, stock and barrel, as you say, and everything.

00:31:04.138 --> 00:31:11.939
Their cattle and their everything they took
away, tied it together and all of them.

00:31:11.939 --> 00:31:18.038
They’ve also removed their huts, I’m told,
they’re so frightened.

00:31:18.038 --> 00:31:24.658
And this tiger is nobody else but is Bhairavanathji.

00:31:24.658 --> 00:31:32.829
He does that and you know that He’s St.
George who’s working so very hard.

00:31:32.829 --> 00:31:38.679
Nobody has seen a tiger there the last thirty
years and that area is not known at all for

00:31:38.679 --> 00:31:58.939
tigers and such a big tiger, they said.

00:31:58.939 --> 00:32:02.679
So thank you very much, may God bless you.

00:32:02.679 --> 00:32:09.279
Now if you want to give Me flowers you can
do that and also I would request you to have

00:32:09.279 --> 00:32:12.028
your food, it’s very late already.

00:32:12.028 --> 00:32:17.699
And do you want to have some music or something
after that?

00:32:17.699 --> 00:32:23.489
You can have, what’s the harm?

00:32:23.489 --> 00:32:25.599
You could have your food here if you like.

00:32:25.599 --> 00:32:27.020
It’s quite a warm place isn’t it?

00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:28.020
Is there a heater here?

00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:29.020
No?

00:32:29.020 --> 00:32:30.020
You all should freeze in this place.

00:32:30.020 --> 00:32:31.020
There are so many sayings in English language,
if you just pay attention to it.

00:32:31.020 --> 00:32:32.020
One of them is: oranges and lemons, sold for
a penny; that’s for our, you see, treatment,

00:32:32.020 --> 00:32:33.020
with the lemons we have.

00:32:33.020 --> 00:32:34.020
And there’s another one: London Bridge is
falling down, suggesting that what we believe

00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:35.020
into, all these bridges is not important.

00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:43.509
The bridge with God has to be built and expressing
that material things should fall down.

00:32:43.509 --> 00:32:44.509
And then: Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall.

00:32:44.509 --> 00:32:45.509
There are so many things that explain that
people knew what it was going to be.

00:32:45.509 --> 00:32:46.509
It’s so surprising that there’s a poet
called Lewis.

00:32:46.509 --> 00:32:47.509
He has written, I don’t know if you have
read it or not, have you brought that?

00:32:47.509 --> 00:32:48.509
I wish you had.

00:32:48.509 --> 00:32:49.509
About the procession he saw in India of you
people, you haven’t got it?

00:32:49.509 --> 00:32:50.509
How many of you have read that?

00:32:50.509 --> 00:32:51.509
That’s very exclusive!

00:32:51.509 --> 00:32:52.509
Surprising, nobody has that.

00:32:52.509 --> 00:32:53.509
All right, tomorrow.

00:32:53.509 --> 00:32:54.509
Remember all that you have to get from there.

00:32:54.509 --> 00:32:55.509
Mr. Djamel has to bring many things, I think.

00:32:55.509 --> 00:32:56.509
Also there’s a Commonwealth meeting going
on, better give bandhan, specially to our

00:32:56.509 --> 00:32:57.509
Indian Prime Minister who is a realized soul
and they were telling Me that all the terrorists

00:32:57.509 --> 00:32:58.509
have joined together to kill him.

00:32:58.509 --> 00:32:59.509
And our High Commissioner also, his wife told
Me that all the terrorists have arrived.

00:32:59.509 --> 00:33:00.509
Do you know in London, who rules?

00:33:00.509 --> 00:33:01.509
St. George.

00:33:01.509 --> 00:33:02.509
How dare anybody touch that.

00:33:02.509 --> 00:33:03.509
St. George rules there, so we don’t need
a tiger.

00:33:03.509 --> 00:33:04.509
It’s all right, He’s already there, settled
down.

00:33:04.509 --> 00:33:05.509
Thank you very much, all these and I went
to…, beautiful, all right.

00:33:05.509 --> 00:33:06.509
These are all wild flowers, you’ll be amazed
the country has such an abundance of these

00:33:06.509 --> 00:33:07.509
wonderful flowers and so unique.

00:33:07.509 --> 00:33:08.509
See this one is Ganesha’s flower here, see
this one is the wild flower, you like to see?

00:33:08.509 --> 00:33:09.509
Such beautiful flowers, see this one, two
colors of Ganesha.

00:33:09.509 --> 00:33:10.509
And they last and last, you see, they don’t
need much water, nothing, keep them and they

00:33:10.509 --> 00:33:11.509
last and last.

00:33:11.509 --> 00:33:12.509
Exactly four.

00:33:12.509 --> 00:33:13.509
See how beautiful they are.

00:33:13.509 --> 00:33:13.511
It’s beautiful.
