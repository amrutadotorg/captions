00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:12.560
Now, some people have very
dangerous habits, some have simple habits.

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.893
Like I have a bad habit, or
a good habit, you may say,

00:00:16.973 --> 00:00:19.193
that i must put my right hand under my foot,

00:00:19.273 --> 00:00:23.360
because it's all the time
working, so I want to controll it.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.427
So, I put it under my head
like this, while sleeping

00:00:27.507 --> 00:00:31.694
and sometimes under my foot,
just to make it little bit stop working,

00:00:31.774 --> 00:00:34.893
it works too hard. Just to give it rest.

00:00:34.973 --> 00:00:37.960
So under my pillow I put it and sleep.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.427
But I discovered once, I hurt myself,

00:00:40.507 --> 00:00:43.360
that I now cannot put it under my head.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.660
I said, "It's a very funny habbit I have got."

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:52.793
But it's not such a dangerous one. It's
quite good. So I am continuing with it.

00:00:52.873 --> 00:00:57.026
But I can get rid of it. It's very simple.

00:00:57.106 --> 00:01:01.993
But when I get rid of it I think
the people become overactive

00:01:02.073 --> 00:01:05.293
so I put it again, under my pillow.

00:01:05.373 --> 00:01:10.594
So as Sahaja Yogis all your
habbits should be under your control.

00:01:10.674 --> 00:01:16.993
Now the habits we have formed through drugs,

00:01:17.073 --> 00:01:22.093
from drinking, from anything,
are very dangerous habbits.

00:01:22.173 --> 00:01:29.093
Also, people have their
attention being all the time around.

00:01:29.173 --> 00:01:34.660
All the time is attention here, there and
there, attracting people, looking after them,

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.260
not looking after yourself.

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:44.493
This attention has to be brought
under control. Is very important.

00:01:44.573 --> 00:01:50.360
That's very simple, that whenever it
happens, you just put down your eyes.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.826
Keep your eyes down.

00:01:53.906 --> 00:01:57.560
That's one of the ways we

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:04.627
allow our attentiion to fritter away,
and also our growth becomes stunted.

00:02:04.707 --> 00:02:12.026
This is a very very dangerous thing which
in the West specially we have developed.

00:02:12.106 --> 00:02:16.574
Here, also, people must read every shop's name.

00:02:16.654 --> 00:02:20.052
Indians have a bad habit, because
they have just now started reading,

00:02:20.132 --> 00:02:23.160
so they want to read everything
that they find, anything.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:30.160
So on the road if there is a road of
shops, they read every name of every shop,

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.493
turn round again and see if
they have missed anything.

00:02:35.573 --> 00:02:41.893
It sounds stupid. But they all do
it. And all the time they are doing it.

00:02:41.973 --> 00:02:48.859
So the attention, wherevever it
goes, has to be under our control.

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:53.193
We have to keep it, all
the time under our control.

00:02:53.273 --> 00:02:59.560
As Namadeva has said very clearly,
in Guru Grant Sahib has written,

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:07.026
that when a little child is flying the kite,

00:03:07.106 --> 00:03:11.393
he's talking to everyone, he's playing in a way,

00:03:11.473 --> 00:03:16.759
but his attention is on the kite.

00:03:16.839 --> 00:03:21.060
And when a housewife is carring her duties,

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:28.193
putting her child on her waiste and working,

00:03:28.273 --> 00:03:35.627
then she's doing all kinds of work,
but her attention is on the child.

00:03:35.707 --> 00:03:41.493
The Ladies who are carrying
three-four earthen pots on their heads,

00:03:41.573 --> 00:03:47.260
water filled up to the brim,

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.493
are walking, talking to each
other, having mirth and enjoyment,

00:03:52.573 --> 00:03:58.026
but the attention is on the
earthen pot, on their heads.

00:03:58.106 --> 00:04:01.594
In the same way, whatever adventure you are into,

00:04:01.674 --> 00:04:06.660
whatever you are doing, your
attention should be on your spirit.

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:11.493
Then everything is under control,
and you can never get enveloped

00:04:11.573 --> 00:04:18.026
into anything where attention should not be lost.

00:04:18.106 --> 00:04:20.393
So, these two problems we have,

00:04:20.473 --> 00:04:24.759
and those problems even
after realization people have it.

00:04:24.839 --> 00:04:28.960
So please try, when you are not meditating,

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.540
to keep your attention on your spirit.
