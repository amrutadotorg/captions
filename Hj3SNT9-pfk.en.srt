1
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:22,620
The Chakra of the Goddess lies behind
the sternum bone in the spinal cord.

2
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:37,320
This Chakra is placed above the Bhavasagara,
above the Void, as we call it in Sahaja Yoga.

3
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,400
And the bridge that has to be crossed

4
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:56,200
by the bhaktas, by the seekers, is guarded by Her.

5
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:08,280
She’s the one She helps Her children
to come through that passage

6
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:20,400
when there are negative forces
trying to attack on a seeker.

7
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,900
This chakra is placed at the back
of the sternum bone as I told you.

8
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:37,426
In childhood the antibodies
are formed in the sternum bone.

9
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:47,546
They are the warriors or the
Sainikas (soldiers) of the Devi.

10
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:56,801
Until the age of 12 years they
grow and multiply, and ultimately

11
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,980
they all get distributed all over the body,

12
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:14,640
and a human being is made able to
face any outside invasion on him.

13
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,780
These antibodies

14
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,120
know how to fight.

15
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:39,780
They are extremely confident and
they know who are their enemies.

16
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,489
They have all these messages built in themselves.

17
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:57,170
So when the anti-God element enters
into the being through any process,

18
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:10,001
say, through food, through words, through
action, through devilish people or black magic,

19
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:23,686
these antibodies combine together,
collectively fight the invaders.

20
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:37,150
Those who do not have their
Central Heart properly developed

21
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:42,315
suffer from tremendous insecurity all their lives.

22
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:55,140
When they are children, you try
to control them by frightening.

23
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:02,760
These children later on become extremely insecure.

24
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,763
They are afraid of darkness,
they are afraid of night.

25
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,114
Some of them are afraid of everything.

26
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:22,275
Because the antibodies that are built
in the body are not sufficient in number

27
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,520
and being this center so weak,

28
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:35,392
the person feels extremely insecure.

29
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:42,960
Later on in life when the child goes
to the school or he tries to work

30
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:51,327
out something for the future,

31
00:04:54,540 --> 00:05:01,708
then also his confidence can be shaken
by parents, teachers, and outside people.

32
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:09,966
So it is very important to
understand children who are growing.

33
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:13,620
I’ve told you the first reason,
the family insecurities.

34
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:17,760
The child does not know when
he comes back from school,

35
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:21,674
whether his mother would be
there or she would be gone.

36
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:28,800
They don’t have mothers who can
bear a lot from the husbands

37
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:35,745
and smile and show no signs of
their agony to their children.

38
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:40,620
But the mothers in that country, I’ve
seen, always try to use their children

39
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:45,725
from all kinds of emotional
blackmail, you can call it.

40
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:51,240
They try to torture the child by telling
all the things the husband is doing to

41
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:56,190
them and whatever is the problem
they are facing with the husbands.

42
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:01,500
So the child is not secured by
the mother but on the contrary

43
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:05,229
child starts giving security to mothers there.

44
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:12,660
At a very young age it starts and the child
becomes extremely negative and left-sided.

45
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:18,734
He feels that he’s born in a place
full of hatred, insecurity and fear.

46
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:28,196
When the bhaktas are born in those
countries they are also the same way

47
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,000
because they think if they
have to go to a guru, the guru,

48
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:41,460
as known so far, tortures them or extracts
all the money, takes their pareekshan, test,

49
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,200
and he sometimes leaves them
high and dry on the streets.

50
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:56,100
But in our country the Goddess has
taken Incarnation many a times.

51
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:04,560
Thousands time She has taken here Her
birth, whenever the bhaktas called Her,

52
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:11,837
when they are pestered by the negative
forces, She came on this Earth to save them.

53
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:28,500
These things used to be just accepted by people
but never were really accepted in their hearts.

54
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,240
People thought these are some
sorts of mythological stories

55
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:38,333
that the Goddess came on this Earth
and She tried to save the people.

56
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:45,900
They could not believe that there could be
a Shakti who could be born, who could fight

57
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:54,360
these horrible rakshasas and kill them, and
save Her children, Her bhaktas, from agony.

58
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,999
It was too much.

59
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:06,720
But today in Sahaja Yoga, you have seen that when
Kundalini rises and stops at the Center Nabhi (Heart),

60
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:14,727
you have to say the mantra of
'Jagadamba' and the Kundalini rises.

61
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:31,866
That means, She resides in the Center Heart and
when She is being worshipped the Kundalini rises.

62
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:51,302
This center has got twelve petals but the
Goddess has thousand hands and thousand eyes.

63
00:08:53,400 --> 00:09:06,941
She has 16,000 Nadis to work out Her
different aspects of enlightenment.

64
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:15,300
But the first thing She has to do, through
Her generosity and kindness and compassion

65
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:26,880
and patience, She has to suck in the sins,
the Papavimochini, the sins of human beings.

66
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:36,816
One of the sentences in Bible
was, “Wages of fear is sin."

67
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:43,260
Or you can put it the other way
round, “The wages of sin is fear."

68
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:58,301
If you have fear you are committing a
sin against your Self and against God.

69
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:07,001
Because, if Mother is Almighty and
She can solve all your problems,

70
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:12,360
you are under Her protection,
then why should you have any fear?

71
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,709
That means you do not believe
that She’s that powerful.

72
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:25,920
When a person is frightened this center starts

73
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:33,600
breathing fast giving rhythmic
instructions to all the antibodies.

74
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:42,404
With that you feel you are getting
a palpitation in the heart.

75
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:52,798
This palpitation is nothing but a
signal to all the antibodies to fight

76
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,373
the emergency of an attack.

77
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:04,200
So the right side of every human
being represents the fatherhood,

78
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:11,111
the fatherhood and the fatherhood
of a man is very important.

79
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:20,100
If this center is spoilt or if there’s something
wrong with it, then you get asthma as a disease.

80
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:28,939
Asthma is only caused by this center being spoilt
or some other combinations with this center.

81
00:11:28,939 --> 00:11:31,980
Asthma is very common among girls and boys.

82
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:37,620
And, the relationship with the father
or the understanding of the father or

83
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:43,080
your own fatherhood is not all right
you get this trouble of asthma and for

84
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:49,364
that one has to ask the questions to the
sadhakas, what sort of a father you have?

85
00:11:49,698 --> 00:11:51,600
As one gentleman came and asked Me,

86
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,840
“Why everybody’s asking me
what sort of a father you have?

87
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:59,160
What sort of a, everybody asked me, what
about your father, what about your father?

88
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:03,300
What has my father to do with me?”
Actually everybody feels the Right

89
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:08,940
Heart and they have to ask about the father
because father resides in the Right Heart.

90
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,420
And the principle of fatherhood, if it is spoilt,

91
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:17,700
if there is a problem with the principle
of fatherhood, then you get this problem

92
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:22,560
and many other problems, which I
do not want to discuss now at length.

93
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:28,020
But you can understand a person who has no
father, how diffident he is and how he behaves,

94
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:33,060
and also such people, those who have not
known a father can become very wayward,

95
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:40,320
licentious or permissive, or could
be very much secretly licentious.

96
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:45,960
The people who lose their father do
not have that,

97
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:49,620
they lack in that discipline
that the father gives them.

98
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:55,860
Or could be, such, people could
take to a very remorse and unhappy life.

99
00:12:55,860 --> 00:13:02,100
Or they could be very hard on their children or
could be extremely kind and spoil the children.

100
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:02,880
It could be any way.

101
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:11,580
So it has of both the reactions, either,
too much of love-giving or too much of strictness.

102
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:12,600
It can be anything.

103
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,560
Or a person could be, of this kind,

104
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,880
may be very strict in childhood and
could be extremely lavish in old age.

105
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,000
It’s a, it is a very imbalanced personality.

106
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,757
So the person who has no father has
to know that his father is Shri Rama.

107
00:13:29,757 --> 00:13:30,960
He should not worry about anything.

108
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:36,660
He is the One, with one, arrow
He can kill any number of people.

109
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:41,040
So he should have no fear, at all about his

110
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:47,430
father not being there or father being
dead or something happening like that.

111
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:51,600
On the contrary if the father is dead it’s
better to tell him not to worry about

112
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:57,480
you and that you are all
right so that you leave your

113
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:01,740
father in peace and ask him to take his
birth than to bind him to this earth.

114
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:08,820
This is the Right Heart and the Left Heart is the
mother, actually your own mother, whosoever it is.

115
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:13,920
That is the motherhood in the sense
that if your mother has been extremely

116
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:20,700
unkind and extremely funny or your
relationship with mother is bad,

117
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:28,240
then know that there’s something wrong on the
Left Heart, which is indicated in you.
