1
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:06,970
…that has to be first realised – what
is your category.

2
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:22,590
And if you are that category, of the category
which is seeking beyond what you have and

3
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:36,800
that you are not satisfied with what you have
already, then you are the category of seekers

4
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:47,240
who have been seeking something that is very
subtle, that is not gross, not intelligible

5
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,410
through your sensory organs.

6
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:56,560
How it happens within us – it is very interesting
to see.

7
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:06,441
Within us, as I have told you, there are these
subtle centres which have developed through

8
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:10,240
the process of our evolution.

9
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:17,810
Through the process of our evolution we have
become human beings.

10
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:26,840
While we were becoming human beings, all these
centres have been also evolving within us.

11
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:37,049
These centres are placed in the spinal cord,
in the centre of the spinal cord, and they

12
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:41,549
manifest outside grossly on [the] physical
level, as plexuses.

13
00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:54,210
As they are evolving inside, also the outside,
the gross plexuses are also evolving.

14
00:01:54,210 --> 00:02:00,670
For example, animals do not insure their lives,
do they?

15
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:03,930
They have fear.

16
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:12,920
They know how to react to a fear but they
do not know how to insure.

17
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:19,160
After some time the animals forget their children.

18
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:24,440
Animals can pass through any filth, any dirt,
any untidiness.

19
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:28,370
They don’t understand tidiness, neatness.

20
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:33,800
Animals do not organise.

21
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:40,400
Animals don’t plan.

22
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:47,790
They do sometimes when they have to catch
hold of a prey, but that too, not too far.

23
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:53,330
Like we have five-year plans, ten-year plans,
twenty-year plans as the human being have.

24
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:55,069
They do not put any energy into that.

25
00:02:55,069 --> 00:03:12,760
The reason for all this is that man has evolved
much more than all the animals put together.

26
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:18,740
He is an evolved soul.

27
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:31,760
Now these evolved souls have also got a category
of greater evolved people who are not satisfied

28
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:37,290
with the general norms of life.

29
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:47,610
For example, there are people who are interested
say, in having power.

30
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:48,989
And they want to have power.

31
00:03:48,989 --> 00:03:52,000
Till they die they want to have power.

32
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,879
Till they die they won’t give a resignation.

33
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:59,360
I mean, sometimes they put one foot in the
grave and still the resignation in the another

34
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,550
hand, in case they do not die and they have
to pull out the leg, so it’s better to keep

35
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:05,550
it handy!

36
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:15,019
There are people who stick on to other games
of life, like money.

37
00:04:15,019 --> 00:04:18,449
They are money-oriented people.

38
00:04:18,449 --> 00:04:20,739
They find their securities in money.

39
00:04:20,739 --> 00:04:21,870
They run after money.

40
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:24,310
They plan out everything according to money.

41
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:27,880
All their lives they are doing that.

42
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:36,240
There are [a] third type of people who indulge
into so-called love affairs and things like

43
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:43,040
that; into emotional movements of their mind.

44
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:57,020
But there are some others who think that these
things are not so interesting for them.

45
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:02,860
So the fourth category takes to religion – to
know about beyond.

46
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:14,380
They read about the prophets, the great scriptures,
all the great religions of the world.

47
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:28,150
But as the pioneer of the religion dies, the
followers, somehow or other, built in fanaticism

48
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:39,710
around them and fanaticism is the death of
religion, is absolutely the death of religion.

49
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:49,770
I have seen people who get cancer are sometimes
fanatics.

50
00:05:49,770 --> 00:06:02,680
If you could cure their fanaticism, you can
cure their cancer because all such false identification

51
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:06,370
requires extra energy in a man.

52
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:09,919
He has to stick on to some sort of obstinacy!

53
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:15,990
Now supposing I am holding on to it (the microphone)
and I do not want to leave my hand from here

54
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:17,710
– for nothing at all!

55
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:18,990
I say, “No, I am not going to leave."

56
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:19,990
“No!

57
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:20,990
This is the thing I believe into.

58
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:25,580
I am going to stick on to it!”

59
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:29,300
Then I require a lot of energy to hold on
to it.

60
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:33,400
But if I could be free and see, it is better.

61
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:39,449
Like I remember a gentleman fell down from
the sixteenth story and he was asking for

62
00:06:39,449 --> 00:06:42,140
help and help.

63
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:44,889
And he saw people passing from the back.

64
00:06:44,889 --> 00:06:50,060
He was holding onto one of the rails, and
he could not understand how the people are

65
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:51,060
passing around.

66
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,569
He said, “Help for what?”

67
00:06:52,569 --> 00:06:54,000
He said, “I’m falling."

68
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,080
They said, “Where?

69
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,289
Here is the road!”

70
00:06:57,289 --> 00:07:01,180
He had, just near the road, had caught hold
of the rod!

71
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:03,130
And he was asking for help, and he was just
shouting.

72
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:04,539
When they said, “This is the road.

73
00:07:04,539 --> 00:07:06,910
You better put your foot down."

74
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:08,030
he fainted!

75
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:16,360
Because he had put all his energy into a nonsensical
thing, believing into a myth.

76
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:27,020
And myth always takes away your energy, while
the Truth enriches your energy.

77
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:33,190
Because you don’t have to hold on to the
Truth, the Truth carries you along.

78
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:42,470
Any kind of fanaticism is not your way, as
I told you yesterday.

79
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:46,790
And if anybody is a fanatic, then he is not
seeker.

80
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:50,220
Because he’s found whatever it is.

81
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:54,229
He has to deal with his fanaticism and his
faiths.

82
00:07:54,229 --> 00:08:02,460
So the another category of people are there
which are anti everything: everything that

83
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:03,710
is established.

84
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:04,900
Anything.

85
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:10,870
Christ – they are against Christ.

86
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,060
Anything.

87
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:15,650
They are reactionaries.

88
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:18,949
They are against Nanak Saheb, they are against
Mohammed Saheb.

89
00:08:18,949 --> 00:08:24,610
They are against everything that has been
established because whatever is established

90
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:25,650
is not true.

91
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:31,160
Those who have established have taken a mythical
attitude.

92
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:47,339
When they take up a mythical attitude and
they try to stick onto it, those who think

93
00:08:47,339 --> 00:08:51,980
about it are shocked and they think, “These
are drunk people.

94
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,040
These are possessed people!”

95
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,959
So they say, “Alright, that we are not!”

96
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,679
So we become atheist.

97
00:08:56,679 --> 00:08:58,839
We don’t believe in God.

98
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:01,480
We don’t believe in any spiritual power.

99
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:04,740
We do not believe in any divine power.

100
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:11,569
We do not believe in anything that is said
before.

101
00:09:11,569 --> 00:09:13,752
According to them, all prophets were wrong.

102
00:09:13,752 --> 00:09:15,550
All religions are wrong.

103
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:20,839
There is no God – [they think they are]
the wisest people every born!

104
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:23,110
So there is another category of extra-wise.

105
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:25,089
You can call them intellectuals.

106
00:09:25,089 --> 00:09:30,860
These days I don’t know what you call them.

107
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:35,550
This is another category.

108
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:45,160
Now there is another very subtle category,
which tries to exploit all these things that

109
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,749
are existing.

110
00:09:47,749 --> 00:09:54,449
Some of them do it because they do believe
that they have found out something new, like

111
00:09:54,449 --> 00:09:57,379
psychologist, like Freud.

112
00:09:57,379 --> 00:10:05,429
They are ignorant, absolutely half-baked people.

113
00:10:05,429 --> 00:10:07,819
They do not know the whole thing.

114
00:10:07,819 --> 00:10:11,799
They just know a part of it and to them that’s
the truth.

115
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:17,579
Like you find a needle somewhere and say the
needle is the whole world.

116
00:10:17,579 --> 00:10:22,319
They know very little and they don’t know
what to do with the needle, and so they come

117
00:10:22,319 --> 00:10:26,040
out with the needle, saying, “Needle is
the world!”

118
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:32,750
And such people are very anxious to write
books and convey their messages to the world

119
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:39,040
and communicate to the whole world what they
have found out, while whatever they have found

120
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:49,300
out is nothing but just a few drops of truth.

121
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:54,839
And they are trying their level best to spoil
[it].

122
00:10:54,839 --> 00:11:01,610
Now there is a category of another people
which are sinister.

123
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:05,459
In that you know so many types which I do
not want to discuss here.

124
00:11:05,459 --> 00:11:09,009
From Hitler you can start, all kinds of brutal
people and all that.

125
00:11:09,009 --> 00:11:11,939
They go parallel with all these categories.

126
00:11:11,939 --> 00:11:19,610
But I would say the worst of all are those
who try to make money in the name of God,

127
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:29,439
and worse than that, the worst of all, are
the people who try to play games with God.

128
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:39,389
Those who take money are openly bad but those
who try to play with your Kundalini, with

129
00:11:39,389 --> 00:11:45,600
your Realisation, are really to be called
as demonic categories.

130
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:53,199
And all such people should know, as Blake
has said, that they will go to the hell from

131
00:11:53,199 --> 00:11:56,389
where they can never rise.

132
00:11:56,389 --> 00:12:02,869
Now whether you believe it or not, there is
God.

133
00:12:02,869 --> 00:12:12,559
Sahaja Yoga is a thing today which has reached
that stage where the category of people who

134
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:18,670
are men of God, they do not proclaim on the
streets that, “I am a man of God."

135
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:19,930
No.

136
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:25,259
They do not stand up with banners in their
hands that, “I am the man of God."

137
00:12:25,259 --> 00:12:26,949
They are very normal people.

138
00:12:26,949 --> 00:12:28,129
They are householders.

139
00:12:28,129 --> 00:12:29,320
They have children.

140
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,139
They have grandchildren.

141
00:12:31,139 --> 00:12:32,980
They are very simple people.

142
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:35,319
They lead a very ordinary life.

143
00:12:35,319 --> 00:12:37,880
They are not very successful people.

144
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:43,819
But they are people, men of God.

145
00:12:43,819 --> 00:12:52,879
And these human beings of God are the ones
I am talking about, is the category you people

146
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:54,779
are.

147
00:12:54,779 --> 00:13:00,430
If you are not that category, Sahaja Yoga
is not going to work on you to begin with.

148
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:08,209
Later on, when we have a particular number
of people, the evolution will take such a

149
00:13:08,209 --> 00:13:16,519
dynamic form, that thousands of people will
receive their Self-realisation.

150
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:23,920
Now the Self-realisation is the thing in which
an ordinary man who looks an ordinary common

151
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:33,509
person but who is actually a seeker, a true
seeker, not a false seeker but a true seeker,

152
00:13:33,509 --> 00:13:39,170
receives the grace of the Divine and becomes
a prophet.

153
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:43,910
He becomes a prophet.

154
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:53,389
This is what Sahaja Yoga is, that it makes
you a prophet and a prophet of a very unique

155
00:13:53,389 --> 00:14:01,779
style, because the job of today’s modern
prophets is very different from the prophets

156
00:14:01,779 --> 00:14:06,239
which came before, as I told you yesterday.

157
00:14:06,239 --> 00:14:14,499
The prophets who came before, as we celebrated
yesterday, Guru Nanaka’s birthday and Mohammed

158
00:14:14,499 --> 00:14:21,019
Saheb and all others, like Moses, Abraham
and all these, was to maintain your sustenance

159
00:14:21,019 --> 00:14:26,899
through giving you Ten Commandments.

160
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:32,779
And these Ten Commandments exist in that centre
there, where you see the green centre.

161
00:14:32,779 --> 00:14:34,420
You can see it very clearly in your stomach.

162
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:36,870
The religion is in your stomach.

163
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:39,329
It’s a thing built within you.

164
00:14:39,329 --> 00:14:42,720
It is not that I can give you a lecture about
religion.

165
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,989
But it is built within you.

166
00:14:43,989 --> 00:14:47,089
It is inside you.

167
00:14:47,089 --> 00:14:54,629
And this religion is to be maintained, was
to be maintained that time; very important

168
00:14:54,629 --> 00:15:01,639
was that people should know what helps them
to be a human being.

169
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:07,290
And that was the job of all these prophets
and they did it very well.

170
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:15,279
But their disciples and maybe their followers
made them into fanatic religions.

171
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:16,839
You can’t help it.

172
00:15:16,839 --> 00:15:21,720
I mean, I have always said that they were
like living flowers on this Earth, who came

173
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,249
one after another on the Tree of Life.

174
00:15:24,249 --> 00:15:28,079
And people just plucked those flowers and
said, “This is mine.

175
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:29,079
This is mine."

176
00:15:29,079 --> 00:15:34,119
The flowers became dead, ugly and useless.

177
00:15:34,119 --> 00:15:37,029
That is how fanaticism has prospered.

178
00:15:37,029 --> 00:15:45,129
And all the fanaticism in these modern times
is [now] challenged.

179
00:15:45,129 --> 00:15:49,949
Everywhere people can see it that it is not
logical to be fanatic.

180
00:15:49,949 --> 00:16:00,169
But as a result of ego activity in thinking
they go to another extreme by which they condemn

181
00:16:00,169 --> 00:16:07,089
even the real flowers, even the originators,
the ones who came on this Earth.

182
00:16:07,089 --> 00:16:09,879
This is going too far from the right point.

183
00:16:09,879 --> 00:16:14,139
From one extreme to another extreme they are
moving.

184
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:24,559
Now the specialty of the modern prophets is
that you can make other people prophets.

185
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:27,600
That means you can give them Realisation yourself.

186
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:34,259
This is the difference between the Sahaja
Yoga that worked out at the time of other

187
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:35,259
people.

188
00:16:35,259 --> 00:16:38,470
That’s why there was hardly one or two Realised-souls.

189
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:46,179
At the time of Janaka – say about eight
thousand years back when Shri Rama was ruling,

190
00:16:46,179 --> 00:16:53,069
his father-in-law, who was a great prophet
– he had one disciple whom he gave Realisation.

191
00:16:53,069 --> 00:16:59,049
And with very great tests and all that he
took under his own guidance.

192
00:16:59,049 --> 00:17:01,550
He gave him Realisation.

193
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:10,339
But today the time has changed because the
Life’s Tree has increased, has reach to

194
00:17:10,339 --> 00:17:12,610
that state of maturity, where thousands of
you have to be transformed.

195
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:14,490
It has to be done.

196
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:18,089
It’s the God’s plan.

197
00:17:18,089 --> 00:17:23,939
And those who fit into it are the people who
are of the category who are seeking.

198
00:17:23,939 --> 00:17:35,600
Now, such category can be understood by many
ways and there are some tests to understand

199
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,580
what these people are.

200
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:45,210
It may be that such people could be extremely
nervous people, could be, because they cannot

201
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:49,630
bear the unrighteous, sinful, deceitful world.

202
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:56,409
The whole atmosphere may be jarring them.

203
00:17:56,409 --> 00:18:00,080
That’s why they are very shaky.

204
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,690
Could be they might be very nervous because
of that.

205
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:07,059
They could be a people who might be a recluses.

206
00:18:07,059 --> 00:18:12,390
They might be people who might be hot-tempered.

207
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:15,220
They might be people who are escapists.

208
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:17,559
They could be the people who could be druggist.

209
00:18:17,559 --> 00:18:20,159
Could be alcoholic.

210
00:18:20,159 --> 00:18:31,280
They could be anything, because they are running
away from the so-called horrible ‘reality’.

211
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:36,519
Sahaja Yoga is a thing which establishes your
reality within yourself, by which you feel

212
00:18:36,519 --> 00:18:43,840
secure, because your reality is beauty, it
is joy.

213
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:48,710
And then you don’t want to run away from
that.

214
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:58,070
This is what we have to understand, that we
are here to receive our reality, to know ourselves.

215
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:02,919
By knowing ourselves, how many things can
happen to us, you have no idea.

216
00:19:02,919 --> 00:19:10,080
The whole property that you are, the whole
wealth that you are, the whole beauty that

217
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,250
you are, becomes your own.

218
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:15,850
You become the master of your own being.

219
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:21,730
This is the first thing that should happen:
means your ill health must get alright.

220
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:26,039
You know that there are people here who had
very serious diseases, who got completely

221
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:27,039
cured.

222
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:31,570
You know there are people who have mental
problems, who had epilepsies and things – they

223
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:32,570
are cured.

224
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:34,289
And how it happens?

225
00:19:34,289 --> 00:19:37,630
Just by knowing yourself, how powerful you
are.

226
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:39,480
Just think of that!

227
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:46,899
Think of your own powers that, just by knowing
yourself, how you have become so powerful.

228
00:19:46,899 --> 00:19:51,050
But this knowledge is not through your rationality,
that, “I am such.

229
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:52,380
I am Napoleon.

230
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:55,530
I am this."

231
00:19:55,530 --> 00:20:00,830
This kind of a knowledge is really stupid,
it’s egoistical.

232
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:07,669
But this knowledge is a dynamism in your own
awareness.

233
00:20:07,669 --> 00:20:13,610
It’s a new perception within you by which
you become something.

234
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:15,669
You become a different person.

235
00:20:15,669 --> 00:20:20,919
You become a higher, evolved soul.

236
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:28,370
And then you realise that you have suddenly
become a being who is collectively conscious.

237
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:32,980
Some progress very fast but some do not.

238
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:34,840
Some progress tremendously fast.

239
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:41,649
I know of a gentlemen who was supposed to
be a drunkard and used to waste all his money

240
00:20:41,649 --> 00:20:45,649
in races and he did all kinds of things.

241
00:20:45,649 --> 00:20:49,110
He used to smoke like a chimney.

242
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:54,580
And when he got his Realisation, the whole
room was filled with fragrance.

243
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:56,690
And everybody said, “This man?

244
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:58,389
How can we believe, Mother?

245
00:20:58,389 --> 00:20:59,909
He is this and this and this."

246
00:20:59,909 --> 00:21:03,139
I said, “But this is what it is!

247
00:21:03,139 --> 00:21:06,820
This was all the clouds upon him.

248
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:10,340
And all the clouds have gone away and you
see the sun coming in him.

249
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:12,039
He’s a different man."

250
00:21:12,039 --> 00:21:13,870
I don’t believe in the clouds, I believe
in the sun.

251
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:17,919
If I see the sun, the sun is there.

252
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:19,200
I don’t see the clouds at all.

253
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,200
I see the sun.

254
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,740
Perhaps I have more penetrating eyes than
you have.

255
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:24,840
And I see the sun in the man.

256
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,200
He has risen out of that.

257
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,240
And now he is shining like a sun.

258
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,340
So accept him and bow to him.

259
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:33,669
He’s the one who was seeking, really, within.

260
00:21:33,669 --> 00:21:36,279
He thought that by playing races he’ll find
joy.

261
00:21:36,279 --> 00:21:42,110
He thought by eating food like that he will
have joy, or by smoking like that he will

262
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:43,110
have joy.

263
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:45,789
But he never was satisfied within himself.

264
00:21:45,789 --> 00:21:51,299
He never got involved into it to that extent
that he lost his own being and his seeking

265
00:21:51,299 --> 00:21:56,460
and that’s how he is the one who is a true
seeker.

266
00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:03,679
Sometimes it is some shocking to see in Sahaja
Yoga how people get transformed just like

267
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:04,679
that.

268
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:08,970
Just the change starts coming, as if some
magic has happened in the person’s life

269
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:09,970
and he changes.

270
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:13,139
But actually it is very simple to understand.

271
00:22:13,139 --> 00:22:22,289
When it rains and the whole place is so foggy,
you don’t feel like going out anywhere:

272
00:22:22,289 --> 00:22:25,740
it’s so grey, you feel so horrible.

273
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:32,269
But when the sun comes out, everyone, children,
old people, young people, the housewives,

274
00:22:32,269 --> 00:22:36,779
all of them come out to greet the sun.

275
00:22:36,779 --> 00:22:45,230
When your sun comes out and you see your brilliance
yourself and then, “Oh, it’s me!

276
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:47,330
Is it me?

277
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:49,299
Oh, God!”

278
00:22:49,299 --> 00:22:51,539
And that starts transforming.

279
00:22:51,539 --> 00:22:54,860
And you are amazed to see yourself the way
you are transformed.

280
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:56,640
That has to happen for you.

281
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:02,019
But for this, already God has planned within
you all these things very beautifully.

282
00:23:02,019 --> 00:23:07,940
As beautifully as He has made your exterior,
He has made your interior equally beautifully,

283
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:11,460
very delicately and with very great, very
great care.

284
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:19,360
Within you lies the Kundalini, in the triangular
bone, the sacred bone called as sacrum, which

285
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,389
gives you Realisation.

286
00:23:21,389 --> 00:23:30,730
This is one about which Christ has said, “I
will appear before you like tongues of flames."

287
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:34,100
What is that?

288
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:45,490
Every person has talked about him, but the
trouble is, how will you explain tongues of

289
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:46,490
flames?

290
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:48,899
Kabira has talked so clearly.

291
00:23:48,899 --> 00:23:50,999
He has said, “Ida, Pingala, Sushumna."

292
00:23:50,999 --> 00:23:58,419
Everything he has talked about, he talked
about Kundalini!

293
00:23:58,419 --> 00:24:02,279
Shankaracharya has talked about.

294
00:24:02,279 --> 00:24:04,159
I would say Blake, William Blake.

295
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:05,159
You read him.

296
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:06,159
You will be amazed!

297
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:08,059
He’s talking of today in his book, “Milton”.

298
00:24:08,059 --> 00:24:11,400
He is talking of Jerusalem of today.

299
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:20,030
This place, this England, is going to be the
Jerusalem, is the pilgrimage, where the people

300
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:23,840
of God are going to be the prophets.

301
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,540
He has talked of today!

302
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:26,540
Can you imagine?

303
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:30,370
He was not very old; he was not very ancient,
very modern.

304
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:35,120
He has prophesised about these days and it
is happening.

305
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:39,330
You don’t have to worry about these things.

306
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:45,779
It is God’s plan that He has done it so
well, and individually all of you have got

307
00:24:45,779 --> 00:24:49,669
this Kundalini in your triangular bone, called
‘sacrum’.

308
00:24:49,669 --> 00:24:52,470
See, the word ‘sacrum’ means ‘sacred’.

309
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:57,889
How did they know, the word ‘sacrum’ to
be put for this, is a sacred bone?

310
00:24:57,889 --> 00:25:03,210
This was discovered in ancient times, long,
long time back.

311
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:09,450
Even they say that Indra was given Realisation
by Dattatreya.

312
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:10,450
To that extent!

313
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:12,740
I mean, how many years back it was done!

314
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:14,590
But it was a guarded secret.

315
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:18,549
It was done for very few people.

316
00:25:18,549 --> 00:25:20,700
Only it was Shankaracharya who started first.

317
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:23,179
Adi Shankaracharya I would say, not these
[modern ones].

318
00:25:23,179 --> 00:25:27,950
But the Adi Shankaracharya started talking
about it so clearly.

319
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:37,130
Everywhere you find, even in Koran or in the
Bible, everywhere it is said, any scripture

320
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:48,179
which has lasted the time, it’s said that,
“You are to be born again."

321
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:50,295
Now people have taken a note from that and
they certify, “I am a twice-born."

322
00:25:50,295 --> 00:25:52,970
Now what is the proof that you are twice-born?

323
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:57,480
Everybody says, “I am a twice-born."

324
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:00,029
It is absurd.

325
00:26:00,029 --> 00:26:01,490
What do you mean by twice-born?

326
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:08,830
As I have told you before that a bird is called
as twice-born in Sanskrit language, and a

327
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:14,059
Realised-soul is also called a twice-born.

328
00:26:14,059 --> 00:26:25,460
As the bird is an egg and, when the egg breaks,
we do not see the egg but we see the chick

329
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:27,759
coming out of it.

330
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:35,249
In the same way it has to happen to you that,
when your egg, which is made by the formation

331
00:26:35,249 --> 00:26:43,179
of ego and superego, the yellow and the blue
on your head, has to break and then you become

332
00:26:43,179 --> 00:26:51,980
a new personality, a personality which is
very different from what it was before.

333
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:57,039
Egg doesn’t grow, does it?

334
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:59,299
But the chick grows.

335
00:26:59,299 --> 00:27:05,850
Now the growth starts in the spiritual arena,
in the spiritual understanding, into spiritual

336
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:06,850
education.

337
00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:08,889
Now it starts!

338
00:27:08,889 --> 00:27:12,860
Not before that.

339
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:18,309
You start feeling the Divine Power around
and you understand that you are a universal

340
00:27:18,309 --> 00:27:19,309
being.

341
00:27:19,309 --> 00:27:31,840
All these nonsensical ideas, of race, of different
religions, of different communities, are products

342
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:40,360
of human endeavour, or we should say the human
thinking; which is so stupid sometimes that

343
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:45,869
it is impossible for a person like me to understand
why we have to carry a passport from places

344
00:27:45,869 --> 00:27:47,470
to places.

345
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:55,399
The God Almighty also must be failing to understand
how this has been worked out by the great

346
00:27:55,399 --> 00:27:57,789
wise human beings.

347
00:27:57,789 --> 00:28:00,540
That He made only one world.

348
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:03,290
He didn’t make many worlds.

349
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:12,149
He just put some rivers and some nice mountains
and some hills and dales, to make it a beautiful,

350
00:28:12,149 --> 00:28:13,899
interesting place for you.

351
00:28:13,899 --> 00:28:24,220
And you have divided into nations and into
cities and villages and then into smaller

352
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:32,440
places and then into a road and then into
your houses and then into your kitchen.

353
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:38,279
That’s what we have become!

354
00:28:38,279 --> 00:28:44,190
But the category of the people about whom
I am saying, they can’t remain in their

355
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:51,240
kitchens, they can’t remain in their houses,
they cannot remain in their nations.

356
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:54,149
They transcend the whole Universe.

357
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:57,799
They cover the whole Universe.

358
00:28:57,799 --> 00:29:00,570
Because they become universal beings.

359
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:02,529
They cannot think in this terminology.

360
00:29:02,529 --> 00:29:04,679
It hurts them.

361
00:29:04,679 --> 00:29:05,679
It hurts them.

362
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:10,889
You see, it would be like a great person being
put in a sack.

363
00:29:10,889 --> 00:29:17,139
You just force him to get into a sack or into
a cup – how he’ll be hurt?

364
00:29:17,139 --> 00:29:21,269
Either the cup will break or the fellow will
throw it away.

365
00:29:21,269 --> 00:29:27,369
It’s the ocean you are trying to put it
into a cup, which you cannot do it.

366
00:29:27,369 --> 00:29:32,100
And such a stupidity has been done so far.

367
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:37,870
But the time has come for all the oceans to
be awakened to their greatness.

368
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:47,279
And once they are awakened they will throw
away all these minor boundaries and all these

369
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:58,860
nonsensical barriers that has created such
a mountain from one seed to another seed where

370
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:08,350
two beautiful human beings are sitting and
are fragrant with the fragrance of universal

371
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:09,460
joy.

372
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:14,519
After Realisation only you can also enjoy
another personality.

373
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:16,240
Normally you cannot.

374
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:26,529
What you enjoy is his car, or his house or
his dress or his looks or his behaviour towards

375
00:30:26,529 --> 00:30:27,529
you.

376
00:30:27,529 --> 00:30:32,249
At the most his intellect, his success, his
horses.

377
00:30:32,249 --> 00:30:35,059
I don’t know what else.

378
00:30:35,059 --> 00:30:39,090
But after Realisation you just enjoy his vibrations!

379
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:43,340
You just enjoy him in his innate thing.

380
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:48,600
You do not see his age, you do not see his
caste, you do not see his race but you see

381
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:54,769
all this chaitanya, these vibrations, coming
from the person and you just enjoy for hours

382
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:57,049
together just feeling that.

383
00:30:57,049 --> 00:30:58,269
It’s so enjoyable.

384
00:30:58,269 --> 00:31:03,460
One person like that walks in, and all of
you, “Ah!”

385
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:07,640
This should happen to everyone.

386
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:11,100
It has to happen.

387
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:13,559
The time has come for this happening.

388
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:19,679
That’s why we have so many seekers.

389
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:26,659
They have been ill-treated, they have been
deceived, they have been used, people have

390
00:31:26,659 --> 00:31:28,559
made money out of them.

391
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:31,549
I accept [that].

392
00:31:31,549 --> 00:31:39,739
But then I have to accept also that in seeking
you had to be tested also, to see where do

393
00:31:39,739 --> 00:31:42,440
you stick on.

394
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:46,830
If you want to go to the Truth, you will discard
everything [else].

395
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:49,570
And once you come before the Truth you will
have it.

396
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:57,500
And that’s why this testing has to be done,
because there is ego, human beings have their

397
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,659
egos; they think, “Oh I will do this.

398
00:31:59,659 --> 00:32:00,789
I can do it.

399
00:32:00,789 --> 00:32:02,669
I can sort it out."

400
00:32:02,669 --> 00:32:03,669
Alright.

401
00:32:03,669 --> 00:32:05,100
God says, “Alright, have it.

402
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,429
Have it your way."

403
00:32:06,429 --> 00:32:11,809
Then they will go and break their heads, break
their legs, break their hands and then come

404
00:32:11,809 --> 00:32:13,820
saying that, “Mother, see, I have broken
everything.

405
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:14,950
Now what will you do?”

406
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:15,950
So alright!

407
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:17,770
The Sahaja Yoga has to work it out.

408
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:20,530
But why do all that?

409
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:23,020
Come straight to the Truth.

410
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:30,879
Now, one has to understand that before Realisation
you don’t have to do anything, but after

411
00:32:30,879 --> 00:32:40,409
Realisation those who do not understand their
own esteem, they do not value their potentialities

412
00:32:40,409 --> 00:32:52,230
or their powers, can lose their vibrations
in the early months.

413
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:57,249
It has happened with many people: they have
lost their vibrations completely because they

414
00:32:57,249 --> 00:32:58,909
have not paid any attention to themselves.

415
00:32:58,909 --> 00:33:01,330
They have not tried to improve themselves.

416
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:03,769
They have not tried to keep up the vibrations.

417
00:33:03,769 --> 00:33:05,889
It’s like enlightening any light.

418
00:33:05,889 --> 00:33:12,860
We have to look after it for a while till
it takes its own form.

419
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:19,909
And that is how in Sahaja Yoga so many come
and get Realisation, but those who grow are

420
00:33:19,909 --> 00:33:21,100
the real Sahaja yogis.

421
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:24,299
The rest of them are wasted, are just wasted.

422
00:33:24,299 --> 00:33:30,019
They’ll come back again but they take too
much time and the Divine does not have interest

423
00:33:30,019 --> 00:33:34,980
in such people, it does not help such people.

424
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:42,019
So I have to request to you, request you that
if you are seekers, you have to have your

425
00:33:42,019 --> 00:33:43,019
Realisation.

426
00:33:43,019 --> 00:33:44,590
Without that you will not be happy.

427
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:55,509
But you must have full idea and responsibility
about yourself that you are now an enlightened

428
00:33:55,509 --> 00:33:56,889
light.

429
00:33:56,889 --> 00:34:02,279
You are a beacon and you cannot afford to
hide yourself.

430
00:34:02,279 --> 00:34:04,499
You have to give light to others.

431
00:34:04,499 --> 00:34:06,830
You have to work it out that way.

432
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:16,220
It’s not now a question of only one Christ
bearing the cross or one Mohammed talking

433
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:20,109
about the message or one Nanaka fighting the
whole world.

434
00:34:20,109 --> 00:34:25,339
It’s all of you put together have to fight
it out and work it out.

435
00:34:25,339 --> 00:34:26,549
That’s what it is today.

436
00:34:26,549 --> 00:34:31,050
That’s why Sahaja Yoga, one can say, has
reached the state of Mahayoga.

437
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:35,750
“Sahaja”, Sahaja means born with you.

438
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:37,310
It’s spontaneous.

439
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:40,249
It is within you.

440
00:34:40,249 --> 00:34:42,070
The whole thing is within you.

441
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:46,780
Just like a seed sprouts, the Kundalini sprouts
spontaneously.

442
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:48,829
You do not have to do anything about it.

443
00:34:48,829 --> 00:34:56,339
But when it becomes Mahayoga, means it becomes
en masse, thousands of people can be given

444
00:34:56,339 --> 00:34:57,339
Realisation.

445
00:34:57,339 --> 00:35:05,140
In India we have someone who has given Realisation
to ten thousand people in a village!

446
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:09,859
He is just a farmer and he has done it.

447
00:35:09,859 --> 00:35:13,550
So you can imagine how much you can do.

448
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:20,880
But in the West, as I have always warned you,
it’s a very ego-oriented society, and people

449
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,670
are very exclusive.

450
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:23,670
Everybody wants to sort out.

451
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:26,670
Immediately after Realisation everybody becomes
an Archbishop of Canterbury!

452
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:34,460
And they think no end of themselves.

453
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:38,420
You have to have spiritual knowledge after
this.

454
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:40,740
You have to know everything about it.

455
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:43,089
You have to master it.

456
00:35:43,089 --> 00:35:48,510
You have to master your body, you have to
master your mind and you have to master the

457
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:50,670
whole art of Kundalini.

458
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:54,670
Then only you can say that it works.

459
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:58,130
Otherwise, it’s just a waste.

460
00:35:58,130 --> 00:36:04,109
You are the people who are in the foundation,
and you have to be the strongest people.

461
00:36:04,109 --> 00:36:09,430
You have to be the masters of Kundalini, absolutely
the masters of Kundalini.

462
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:10,910
It’s not individual.

463
00:36:10,910 --> 00:36:13,000
This is Mahayoga.

464
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:19,940
Anybody who tries to be individualistic will
be lost, will be no more in the circulation.

465
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:24,910
This I have told you hundred, and hundred
and one times.

466
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:34,150
And the Spirit can only grow in collectivity
because the nature of Spirit is universal.

467
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:36,420
You cannot achieve anything exclusively.

468
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:40,790
Those who try it will fail.

469
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:49,980
You all have to join together and should know
that you all awakened people.

470
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:58,540
In the Primordial Being you are like the awakened
cells who know the Primordial Being and who

471
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:07,380
have the powers by which they can communicate
the powers of God to other people.

472
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:16,010
You all have to be absolutely one with each
other, not to find faults but to love and

473
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:17,910
enjoy each other.

474
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:21,619
That’s the best way you can move.

475
00:37:21,619 --> 00:37:30,750
As you know that this subject is so varied,
and it requires so much of explanation, for

476
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:36,450
which now we have lots of tapes, and if you
people want you can get tapes from Douglas

477
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:39,670
(Fry), who has really put in lot of effort
for it.

478
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:50,380
You can play them and can understand and can
improve all your knowledge about Sahaja Yoga.

479
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:56,109
And now I’ll be going to India and perhaps
there may be only one lecture more where it

480
00:37:56,109 --> 00:38:01,050
will be just a farewell function we’ll have.

481
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:07,859
I would like some of the Sahaja Yogis to ask
some questions today, because it’s a nice

482
00:38:07,859 --> 00:38:11,450
opportunity for you to ask some questions.

483
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:15,319
But not the people who haven’t got Realisation,
because those who haven’t got Realisation

484
00:38:15,319 --> 00:38:17,799
are not entitled because they do not know.

485
00:38:17,799 --> 00:38:20,240
They have no news about it.

486
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,460
They don’t understand.

487
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:23,940
They should not ask any questions.

488
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:25,829
Those who are Sahaja Yogis should ask.

489
00:38:25,829 --> 00:38:31,099
I mean, it would be something like those who
have never visited India, are asking questions

490
00:38:31,099 --> 00:38:32,099
about India.

491
00:38:32,099 --> 00:38:39,581
Better go to India, find out about [it] yourself,
see it in deeply, how it is, what it is, and

492
00:38:39,581 --> 00:38:41,350
then you can ask questions.

493
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:46,680
Not just visit Delhi talk to some Westernised
Indians and come back and tell me stories

494
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:47,680
about them!

495
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:53,940
In the same way, those who have not been to
England, meet some of the politicians or something

496
00:38:53,940 --> 00:39:02,240
like that, go back and tell something about
England which I will not believe and you should

497
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,240
not believe.

498
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:09,910
You have to understand the country on a philosophical
level, on philosophy – where are they.

499
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:16,400
And unless and until you understand that subtle
thing, you cannot say anything about it.

500
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:23,290
For example, for England, I have always said
that the young generation of England are the

501
00:39:23,290 --> 00:39:24,640
best in the whole world.

502
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:31,319
Take it from me, whether they are English,
or whatever it is, whatever nationality, but

503
00:39:31,319 --> 00:39:35,460
the young generation that are English are
the best.

504
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:37,390
No doubt about it.

505
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:43,760
Because they have developed, no doubt, but
they have kept their wisdom intact.

506
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:48,010
India, the young people are developing and
they have to go through all your discotheques

507
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:52,490
and all those rumble-tumbles, till they come
to the stage where they’ll take alcohols

508
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:58,880
and then they will take to your drugs and
then they might take to [seeking].

509
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,640
Americans are too shifty.

510
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:04,490
They have not kept their wisdom intact.

511
00:40:04,490 --> 00:40:13,320
(laughter) But thanks to the tradition of
British, that you have kept your traditions

512
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:19,640
still intact and you know about your country
because it’s a small country.

513
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:24,490
So I depend very much on the English youth.

514
00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:28,040
But if you ask anyone else, they will say,
“Oh, these English youth [are] extremely

515
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,700
rude, arrogant.

516
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:32,200
Good for nothing!

517
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,869
Drugged, lethargic.

518
00:40:33,869 --> 00:40:34,869
Useless!”

519
00:40:34,869 --> 00:40:40,970
But I have seen now young people and young
people all over the world and this is what

520
00:40:40,970 --> 00:40:43,160
I have to say about them.

521
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:46,790
Now I would like you to ask me questions.

522
00:40:46,790 --> 00:40:57,000
First the Sahaja yogis, then we can ask the
non-Sahaja yogis.

523
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,020
Difficult.

524
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:04,960
You have become thoughtless, actually, you
cannot ask!

525
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:08,049
This is the trick of Sahaja Yoga!

526
00:41:08,049 --> 00:41:11,730
When it crosses this point, you cannot think.

527
00:41:11,730 --> 00:41:18,970
Even if you want to think, you cannot.

528
00:41:18,970 --> 00:41:23,339
No questions?

529
00:41:23,339 --> 00:41:25,460
Now non-sahaja yogis, please.

530
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:30,630
Seeker: How about times when you should do
the meditation?

531
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:31,630
What sort of times?

532
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:32,630
Shri Mataji: Oh, there’s nothing.

533
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:33,630
No rules.

534
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:34,630
You go beyond time.

535
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:35,630
Every time you are in meditation only.

536
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:38,230
You see, what is meditation?

537
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:40,380
You cannot do meditation, you have to be in
meditation.

538
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:41,380
You become meditative.

539
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:43,010
You are all the time in meditation.

540
00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:52,260
I mean, there is no time when you are not,
because you become a different person.

541
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:56,690
Those people who do meditation, I don’t
know how they do it.

542
00:41:56,690 --> 00:41:57,790
Really, I can’t understand.

543
00:41:57,790 --> 00:42:01,099
Because which is the way you enter into the
realm of meditation?

544
00:42:01,099 --> 00:42:07,740
Unless and until the Kundalini takes your
attention to that state,you cannot meditate.

545
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:08,740
So how can you do?

546
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:12,900
You cannot lift the Kundalini with your hand
and put Her there.

547
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:15,200
No lift can work it out.

548
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:20,270
It’s only through spontaneous awakening
that the Kundalini rises.

549
00:42:20,270 --> 00:42:22,300
So you cannot do meditation.

550
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:26,960
And once you are there, you are there.

551
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:29,460
So there is no timing.

552
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:30,680
Nothing fixed.

553
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:35,920
But it depends on the kind of a person they
are.

554
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:46,280
For example, say somebody who gets up [at]
eleven o’clock in the morning, doesn’t

555
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:55,230
brush his teeth, rushes to the office, comes
back home, sleeps at two o’clock in the

556
00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:59,849
night, can’t sleep before two o’clock,
then such a person has to develop certain

557
00:42:59,849 --> 00:43:01,599
habits.

558
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:05,780
Because we have to neutralise the habits that
we have had.

559
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:09,920
So maybe that time we will have to just turn
the tables, and we can manage.

560
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,619
We can change all our habits.

561
00:43:12,619 --> 00:43:17,900
And we can have such habits by which we neutralise
our old habits.

562
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:20,880
It depends on what sort of a person it is.

563
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:25,940
For example, we Indians have a bad habit of
getting up very early in the morning and having

564
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:28,289
a bath in the morning.

565
00:43:28,289 --> 00:43:32,490
Whether it is England, America or even if
we are with Eskimos, we’ll do that!

566
00:43:32,490 --> 00:43:33,490
That’s typical.

567
00:43:33,490 --> 00:43:35,289
Otherwise, we don’t feel happy.

568
00:43:35,289 --> 00:43:40,300
Just before going to the office, we’ll take
our baths and walk out in the cold.

569
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:45,250
I mean, it is the greatest punishment for
an Indian to say, “You don’t take your

570
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:46,250
bath."

571
00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:49,390
I mean, after coming to England some of them
have reconciled.

572
00:43:49,390 --> 00:43:56,710
And to take bath in the night and sleep, they
can’t believe it, they just don’t know

573
00:43:56,710 --> 00:43:58,180
what it is.

574
00:43:58,180 --> 00:44:01,150
So they get lung troubles.

575
00:44:01,150 --> 00:44:02,930
Some of them have got lung cancer.

576
00:44:02,930 --> 00:44:08,510
One of the common diseases I’ve seen amongst
Indians is what you call the, we call it the

577
00:44:08,510 --> 00:44:13,299
heart chakras, the, the cardiac plexus catching;
common.

578
00:44:13,299 --> 00:44:20,710
The reason is this, that, they have no consideration
about the temperature outside.

579
00:44:20,710 --> 00:44:25,609
Now if you tell them, they can’t believe
me.

580
00:44:25,609 --> 00:44:28,579
They think a religious person must take his
bath every day.

581
00:44:28,579 --> 00:44:31,860
That’s the idea they have.

582
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:33,080
Not in England.

583
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:38,829
I mean, you can take your bath every day,
but not the bath and just walk out [of the

584
00:44:38,829 --> 00:44:39,829
house].

585
00:44:39,829 --> 00:44:47,720
Then I have to tell, “Can you have you bath,
say, thrice a week or four times a week, if

586
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:48,720
possible?”

587
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:53,849
But to an Englishmen, you better get up at
four o’clock and have your bath!

588
00:44:53,849 --> 00:44:55,720
It depends on who you are.

589
00:44:55,720 --> 00:45:04,180
So there is nothing like having a fixed thing
in Sahaja Yoga.

590
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:08,970
It depends on what sort of a person you have,
what habits are there, what are your loopholes,

591
00:45:08,970 --> 00:45:10,099
what are your weaknesses.

592
00:45:10,099 --> 00:45:11,859
So we have to look after that.

593
00:45:11,859 --> 00:45:15,309
Like, it’s very common practice, you know.

594
00:45:15,309 --> 00:45:19,940
Supposing we have to go to my house from here.

595
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:23,430
Now you don’t know how to go, so you see
the map and whichever way you have to go,

596
00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:24,440
you just go.

597
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:26,640
It’s a new life.

598
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,830
It’s a new map.

599
00:45:28,830 --> 00:45:31,030
So you have to see which way you have to go.

600
00:45:31,030 --> 00:45:34,619
You change accordingly and you go accordingly.

601
00:45:34,619 --> 00:45:37,690
You cannot have fixed idea now, anymore.

602
00:45:37,690 --> 00:45:39,420
You have to see.

603
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:45,369
If your car has got a trouble with its brake,
better is to repair the brake, isn’t it?

604
00:45:45,369 --> 00:45:47,300
Or will you say that, “Doesn’t matter.

605
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:51,880
Even [if] my brake is bad, I’ll go ahead.

606
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:54,940
As long as my tyres are alright, I don’t
care for the brake."

607
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:56,220
Sahaja Yoga is just opposite.

608
00:45:56,220 --> 00:46:01,710
If the brake is not alright, don’t worry
about the tyres, but think about the brake.

609
00:46:01,710 --> 00:46:04,780
It’s very discretionary.

610
00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:09,950
You become very discrete about yourself and
you start repairing your car; that’s yourself.

611
00:46:09,950 --> 00:46:13,870
Because you get out of your car and you see
the problems.

612
00:46:13,870 --> 00:46:17,650
You are not identified anymore with you.

613
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:21,950
For example, Don would come and tell Me, “Mother,
I am catching on my Agnya here."

614
00:46:21,950 --> 00:46:23,460
Now what does that mean?

615
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:25,650
It means actually Ego.

616
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:30,670
But he will have no objection in telling me
or he will in no way feel ashamed to tell

617
00:46:30,670 --> 00:46:34,180
me that, “My ego is like a balloon here
coming up Mother.

618
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:36,290
Better solve the problem."

619
00:46:36,290 --> 00:46:42,289
You see your ego so clearly and you want to
get rid of it.

620
00:46:42,289 --> 00:46:44,140
Anybody would do that.

621
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:50,030
But if you tell somebody before Realisation,
“You have got ego,” you’ve had it.

622
00:46:50,030 --> 00:46:53,920
I have never done that and none of you should
do.

623
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:56,410
Let them feel the Agnya after Realisation.

624
00:46:56,410 --> 00:46:58,980
They come and tell you and you move it.

625
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:03,089
In the same way, any other trouble, even for
diseases, if you tell somebody that, “You

626
00:47:03,089 --> 00:47:06,400
have such disease,” he may jump down from
here with fear.

627
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:12,470
In Sahaja Yoga you come to know about the
diseases much, much before any doctors know,

628
00:47:12,470 --> 00:47:16,410
because on your fingers you can feel it.

629
00:47:16,410 --> 00:47:18,500
But you don’t have to tell the person at
all.

630
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:20,319
You just talk in your code language.

631
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:22,510
What is catching?

632
00:47:22,510 --> 00:47:23,529
You tell, “This is catching.

633
00:47:23,529 --> 00:47:25,250
Ekadasha Rudra is catching."

634
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:27,150
Alright, what does that mean?

635
00:47:27,150 --> 00:47:30,339
That is the beginning of the cancer.

636
00:47:30,339 --> 00:47:32,720
There’s already for it.

637
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:33,720
So Ekadasha.

638
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:37,040
Clear out the Ekadasha Rudra, is all here
(pointing to forehead).

639
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:41,150
Now nobody knows what Ekadasha Rudra is, except
for the Sahaja yogis.

640
00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:45,630
And they know there is no danger because it
is curable.

641
00:47:45,630 --> 00:47:46,630
So they clear it out.

642
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:53,359
That’s the beginning of a personality, where
he starts getting into this trouble or that

643
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:54,359
trouble.

644
00:47:54,359 --> 00:48:02,480
And say left Agnya is catching, is a sign
that he is going lunatic asylum and little

645
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:03,480
combinations.

646
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:07,410
You don’t have to tell the person but you
can save him from going to lunatic asylum.

647
00:48:07,410 --> 00:48:09,890
He need never go.

648
00:48:09,890 --> 00:48:14,319
People have come down to our program to lunatic
asylum and when they went back, they were

649
00:48:14,319 --> 00:48:16,039
told, “You better not come up here."

650
00:48:16,039 --> 00:48:18,180
It can happen like that.

651
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:19,830
It’s very simple.

652
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:21,770
It is so simple, you can’t imagine.

653
00:48:21,770 --> 00:48:26,950
The whole thing is so simple but you have
to learn what it is.

654
00:48:26,950 --> 00:48:29,510
You can cure people.

655
00:48:29,510 --> 00:48:31,160
You can help your atmosphere.

656
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:33,859
You can do lots of things.

657
00:48:33,859 --> 00:48:39,320
The greatest of all that you become the collective
being.

658
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:40,880
So it changes.

659
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:42,340
There’s no time, nothing.

660
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:44,160
You are a free bird.

661
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:45,260
It’s all freedom.

662
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:46,359
There’s no bondage.

663
00:48:46,359 --> 00:48:48,210
You yourself want to sit down meditating.

664
00:48:48,210 --> 00:48:55,579
Now I came here, I was supposed to talk and
start my speech but I was enjoying my meditation

665
00:48:55,579 --> 00:48:58,940
so much so I went into that.

666
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:07,630
All the time you are in meditation mood and
you can enjoy it anytime you want to

667
00:49:07,630 --> 00:49:13,059
Seeker: Do you hope to come back to England
in the near future?

668
00:49:13,059 --> 00:49:15,569
Shri Mataji: No, no, I am stationed here.

669
00:49:15,569 --> 00:49:24,890
Absolutely, I am glued to this place for five
years more!

670
00:49:24,890 --> 00:49:27,340
And I am going to come back very soon.

671
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:33,369
I am there only for two months, or one month
I will be going to Australia.

672
00:49:33,369 --> 00:49:36,470
So [after] three months altogether, I’m
back.

673
00:49:36,470 --> 00:49:42,279
I’m sure even when I go back after five
years, your government won’t object [to]

674
00:49:42,279 --> 00:49:43,279
my coming here.

675
00:49:43,279 --> 00:49:45,280
I hope so by that time.

676
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:47,730
So, it’s just I had to come here.

677
00:49:47,730 --> 00:49:51,089
I have been now here seven years and five
years more.

678
00:49:51,089 --> 00:49:53,210
Twelve years!

679
00:49:53,210 --> 00:49:56,390
Can you imagine?

680
00:49:56,390 --> 00:49:57,460
Alright?

681
00:49:57,460 --> 00:50:01,059
That should set you alright.

682
00:50:01,059 --> 00:50:04,299
That was one of the fears is it?

683
00:50:04,299 --> 00:50:05,299
No.

684
00:50:05,299 --> 00:50:06,299
Now is it alright for all of you?

685
00:50:06,299 --> 00:50:07,299
Anyone else?

686
00:50:07,299 --> 00:50:10,020
Sahaja Yogi: You can tell us something about
dharma Mother.

687
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:11,030
Shri Mataji: Dharma?

688
00:50:11,030 --> 00:50:12,040
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.

689
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:18,460
Shri Mataji: There’s a, there’s a tape
on dharma and on Guru which you can see.

690
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:31,750
Dharma is the sustenance which is established
by an aspect of God in our stomach.

691
00:50:31,750 --> 00:50:34,589
Our stomach teaches us our dharma.

692
00:50:34,589 --> 00:50:40,760
“Dharayati sa dharmaha”, means the one
you sustain is your dharma.

693
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:49,250
For example, the dharma of gold is that it
is untarnishable.

694
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:53,160
The dharma of carbon is [that] it has got
four valencies.

695
00:50:53,160 --> 00:51:00,430
If you have seen the periodic laws of chemistry,
you will know that all the elements have got

696
00:51:00,430 --> 00:51:03,040
their own dharmas.

697
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:08,779
And they are given these dharmas by the law
of God.

698
00:51:08,779 --> 00:51:13,880
It’s the Divine Law which has given them
these dharmas.

699
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:25,180
Up to the stage of human beings the dharma
of a person or of any animal, or of any element,

700
00:51:25,180 --> 00:51:30,299
is determined absolutely by divine laws and
they do not cross it.

701
00:51:30,299 --> 00:51:35,200
For example, a lion will behave like a lion.

702
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:37,930
He cannot behave like a cat.

703
00:51:37,930 --> 00:51:44,190
A scorpion will behave like itself.

704
00:51:44,190 --> 00:51:47,119
It cannot behave like a lion.

705
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:50,850
A tiger will behave like a tiger.

706
00:51:50,850 --> 00:51:57,880
Tiger is the king and he won’t eat anything
killed by another animal.

707
00:51:57,880 --> 00:52:03,539
Only when he is hungry, he kills the animal
and he eats whatever he likes in one gulp

708
00:52:03,539 --> 00:52:06,360
and then he rests and others come and eat
that.

709
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:16,030
He won’t eat anything that is eaten by others
and he won’t kill anything that he need

710
00:52:16,030 --> 00:52:17,030
not kill.

711
00:52:17,030 --> 00:52:18,030
He’s the king.

712
00:52:18,030 --> 00:52:25,900
That’s why if one tiger is killed in a forest
the whole forest seems so gloomy.

713
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:28,049
Because their king has been killed.

714
00:52:28,049 --> 00:52:30,420
Though he’s a terror for them.

715
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:36,920
But he lives with his own dharma, with his
own boundaries.

716
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:38,930
He doesn’t cross his boundaries.

717
00:52:38,930 --> 00:52:44,829
Any one of these, up to the human level, have
their own dharmas.

718
00:52:44,829 --> 00:52:54,250
Only the human beings have been given the
freedom to cross the dharma, they can.

719
00:52:54,250 --> 00:53:02,350
I mean, in a human being, you can find a lion,
you can find a serpent and you can find also

720
00:53:02,350 --> 00:53:04,109
a worm.

721
00:53:04,109 --> 00:53:08,579
You can find the combination of all that in
one person or in the whole group you’ll

722
00:53:08,579 --> 00:53:12,549
find all kinds.

723
00:53:12,549 --> 00:53:15,760
But if they want they can transcend.

724
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:19,290
And the greatest thing is [that] they can
transcend the dharma itself.

725
00:53:19,290 --> 00:53:25,589
Means they become so great that they can be
sinless.

726
00:53:25,589 --> 00:53:29,170
Just they can’t do any sins.

727
00:53:29,170 --> 00:53:31,500
These dharmas are established within you.

728
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:35,539
These Ten Commandments are there within us.

729
00:53:35,539 --> 00:53:42,720
If you try to transgress them you are losing
your dharma, your sustenance, beyond which

730
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,900
you have to rise.

731
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:50,230
For Realisation, you have to rise beyond dharma,
dharmateet – beyond.

732
00:53:50,230 --> 00:53:54,299
But first your dharma must be established.

733
00:53:54,299 --> 00:53:57,440
If it is not established, you cannot rise.

734
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:05,440
But in Sahaja Yoga, even [if] your dharma
is disturbed it’s forgiven.

735
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:08,549
Still you can get your Realisation.

736
00:54:08,549 --> 00:54:10,700
Then you establish your dharma.

737
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:12,300
It’s better.

738
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:16,461
Because it has been seen [that] those people
who tried to establish their dharmas can become

739
00:54:16,461 --> 00:54:23,920
extremely, extremely dry.

740
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:24,920
They can be fanatics.

741
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:25,920
The compassion part of it is lost.

742
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:35,089
So the compassion itself works in such a way
that all adharmas you have done, whatever

743
00:54:35,089 --> 00:54:37,660
you have done is forgiven.

744
00:54:37,660 --> 00:54:41,839
And you better have your Realisation and with
that power you establish your dharma.

745
00:54:41,839 --> 00:54:44,690
And you have to establish it.

746
00:54:44,690 --> 00:54:50,940
For example, you know that alcohol goes against
your awareness.

747
00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:54,819
Awareness is the main thing, which is enlivened,
enriched by dharma.

748
00:54:54,819 --> 00:54:59,579
The human awareness goes down through alcohol,
you know [this] for definite.

749
00:54:59,579 --> 00:55:08,099
All the great saints who have looked after
the dharma, the prophets, have said against

750
00:55:08,099 --> 00:55:11,020
alcohol and against smoking.

751
00:55:11,020 --> 00:55:16,359
Mohammed Saheb did not say about smoking because
they did not have smoking.

752
00:55:16,359 --> 00:55:19,720
But the same person came as Nanaka.

753
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:27,109
As Guru Nanaka he has prohibited, absolutely
prohibited anything that intoxicates you,

754
00:55:27,109 --> 00:55:29,890
your awareness.

755
00:55:29,890 --> 00:55:33,430
Because they knew that it will harm you very
much.

756
00:55:33,430 --> 00:55:36,210
It does harm you.

757
00:55:36,210 --> 00:55:38,789
You lose the chances of your Realisation very
much.

758
00:55:38,789 --> 00:55:43,950
It is true that it is injurious.

759
00:55:43,950 --> 00:55:47,680
One thing as alcoholism, I am saying.

760
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:56,720
There can be something else people do, like
thieving or anything like that, is against

761
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:58,210
your sustenance.

762
00:55:58,210 --> 00:56:06,250
But Sahaja Yoga is a method by which you first
get your Realisation and then your dharma

763
00:56:06,250 --> 00:56:11,839
is to be established so that you are empowered
by itself.

764
00:56:11,839 --> 00:56:17,599
For example, I never tell people, “Don’t
drink,” because half of the people would

765
00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:20,710
walk out, even Indians.

766
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:26,260
They just drink like – I don’t know – fishes.

767
00:56:26,260 --> 00:56:30,799
I don’t know if fishes drink, but human
beings do!

768
00:56:30,799 --> 00:56:35,560
And then if I tell them, they will be very
angry.

769
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:40,230
We had a doctor here who used to drink who
came to me.

770
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:44,930
He got his Realisation and he went to Germany.

771
00:56:44,930 --> 00:56:49,350
And he was fond of a kind of a wine, a special
wine they make in Germany.

772
00:56:49,350 --> 00:56:51,140
He said, “Let me try some of this."

773
00:56:51,140 --> 00:56:54,569
He had given up because you don’t remember
that you have to drink.

774
00:56:54,569 --> 00:56:56,869
You never get bored enough to drink!

775
00:56:56,869 --> 00:57:00,470
You see, you feel, “What’s the use of
getting up and getting a glass and all that?

776
00:57:00,470 --> 00:57:01,559
I am enjoying myself.

777
00:57:01,559 --> 00:57:02,559
Why to do?”

778
00:57:02,559 --> 00:57:04,299
You are never bored of your company.

779
00:57:04,299 --> 00:57:07,840
You enjoy yourself so much that you don’t
want any drink.

780
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:12,760
Like when you get the nectar of life, why
should you get after these horrible things?

781
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:15,079
You just don’t do it.

782
00:57:15,079 --> 00:57:16,859
But this doctor thought, “Oh, how can that
be?

783
00:57:16,859 --> 00:57:19,650
I may have forgotten but today I’ll have
it."

784
00:57:19,650 --> 00:57:21,549
So he walked into a pub and asked for the
thing.

785
00:57:21,549 --> 00:57:24,019
He drank.

786
00:57:24,019 --> 00:57:27,750
After that he had such a pain, he vomited
all that.

787
00:57:27,750 --> 00:57:34,619
And he told me, “The same wine which I used
to enjoy, started smelling like cork to me.

788
00:57:34,619 --> 00:57:37,980
As if cork has been pushed into my tongue.

789
00:57:37,980 --> 00:57:42,190
I just couldn’t bear it and I vomited and
I had pain in the stomach.

790
00:57:42,190 --> 00:57:43,520
Mother what is this?”

791
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:46,520
I said, “Alright, it’s good!”

792
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:48,430
You cannot do then adharma.

793
00:57:48,430 --> 00:57:51,539
You just cannot do it.

794
00:57:51,539 --> 00:57:52,599
You just become dharma.

795
00:57:52,599 --> 00:57:56,210
You just cannot do it even if you try.

796
00:57:56,210 --> 00:57:57,420
It just works.

797
00:57:57,420 --> 00:58:04,410
I mean, there are people here, at least fifty
percent people, who have been druggists and

798
00:58:04,410 --> 00:58:05,410
chemists!

799
00:58:05,410 --> 00:58:06,410
Absolutely!

800
00:58:06,410 --> 00:58:09,390
They have given [up] drugs just like that.

801
00:58:09,390 --> 00:58:13,010
Just like that they have given [up] drugs.

802
00:58:13,010 --> 00:58:15,970
Of course, they had to get over the after-effects
of drugs.

803
00:58:15,970 --> 00:58:16,970
That’s different.

804
00:58:16,970 --> 00:58:21,930
But as far as giving up is concerned, no problem
at all, no problem of any kind.

805
00:58:21,930 --> 00:58:25,859
I didn’t have to tell them even, it just
happened.

806
00:58:25,859 --> 00:58:32,000
Dharma is established within you, because
when the light is there you see what it is.

807
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:38,250
But this seeing is not what you understand
before Realisation – is through your rational

808
00:58:38,250 --> 00:58:45,420
being or through your sense organs – but
is a happening within you where you become

809
00:58:45,420 --> 00:58:48,420
that, you just feel it.

810
00:58:48,420 --> 00:58:52,230
You just can’t help it.

811
00:58:52,230 --> 00:58:57,980
That should happen; is the best, because human
beings otherwise are difficult.

812
00:58:57,980 --> 00:59:01,809
They find it difficult to maintain it.

813
00:59:01,809 --> 00:59:04,819
Now, I mean, everything they surpassed.

814
00:59:04,819 --> 00:59:09,440
First they use to say, “What about our social
relationships?”

815
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:15,869
Their social relationships have improved,
their jobs have improved, their all material

816
00:59:15,869 --> 00:59:16,869
things have improved.

817
00:59:16,869 --> 00:59:21,609
If you don’t drink, I mean you save fifty
percent of your money as it is!

818
00:59:21,609 --> 00:59:24,350
[It’s] practical apart from anything else!

819
00:59:24,350 --> 00:59:33,750
But, according to Sahaja Yoga it’s much
subtler because the power of maintaining our

820
00:59:33,750 --> 00:59:38,160
material well-being is called as Lakshmi.

821
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:44,170
And this Lakshmi is a very powerful deity
or a very powerful thing.

822
00:59:44,170 --> 00:59:51,260
But, alcoholism, alcohol is one thing or any
such things like drugs and all that, as soon

823
00:59:51,260 --> 00:59:56,270
as she sees entering into the being, she just
disappears.

824
00:59:56,270 --> 00:59:59,040
She just can’t bear it.

825
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:05,990
So a person may think that by drinking he
doesn’t lose his money [but] he is sadly

826
01:00:05,990 --> 01:00:06,990
mistaken.

827
01:00:06,990 --> 01:00:12,319
If he does not drink he will have ten times
more money than he has.

828
01:00:12,319 --> 01:00:18,559
And you can see the result today that, when
Englishmen were known in India, Englishmen’s

829
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:22,400
whisky meant this much, every night; that’s
all.

830
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:26,930
Today if you see the same thing in third generation,
you’ll be shocked.

831
01:00:26,930 --> 01:00:31,410
I mean, first time I came to England I was
surprised because to us Englishmen means one

832
01:00:31,410 --> 01:00:36,369
peck, so little, before sleeping, very decent.

833
01:00:36,369 --> 01:00:40,119
That’s what we thought they were gentlemen
of that calibre.

834
01:00:40,119 --> 01:00:42,890
But when I saw here, I was surprised.

835
01:00:42,890 --> 01:00:44,280
“Oh, God, what is this?

836
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:45,510
What Englishmen are these?”

837
01:00:45,510 --> 01:00:48,480
So this happens in [the] third generation.

838
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:56,309
If alcoholism somehow or other reduces in
England you can surpass all the economic problems;

839
01:00:56,309 --> 01:00:59,190
take it from me.

840
01:00:59,190 --> 01:01:00,190
Absolutely!

841
01:01:00,190 --> 01:01:03,500
You’ll solve all your economics.

842
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:05,170
Just stop alcohols.

843
01:01:05,170 --> 01:01:08,810
All your strikes will stop because they want
money for what?

844
01:01:08,810 --> 01:01:11,970
For alcohols only.

845
01:01:11,970 --> 01:01:14,150
If you get money – have an alcohol.

846
01:01:14,150 --> 01:01:16,119
Somebody dies – have champagne.

847
01:01:16,119 --> 01:01:18,079
Somebody passes – champagne.

848
01:01:18,079 --> 01:01:19,910
Somebody married – champagne.

849
01:01:19,910 --> 01:01:23,799
For everything there is a champagne!

850
01:01:23,799 --> 01:01:27,260
Even in the church you see barrels and barrels
of whisky flowing in.

851
01:01:27,260 --> 01:01:29,990
Barrels and barrels of this thing is flowing
in.

852
01:01:29,990 --> 01:01:31,920
In mean, even in the church!

853
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:39,030
Now today somebody told me that he’s got
a special wine from a Catholic church, which

854
01:01:39,030 --> 01:01:41,970
is called as Benedicts and is a special one.

855
01:01:41,970 --> 01:01:43,829
I said, “Where did you buy that?”

856
01:01:43,829 --> 01:01:45,059
He said, “In Rome, in the Vatican.

857
01:01:45,059 --> 01:01:46,819
You can only get it there, the best!”

858
01:01:46,819 --> 01:01:58,160
I was surprised that you can only get it in
Vatican and he was so proud of it and he was

859
01:01:58,160 --> 01:01:59,640
showing me that!

860
01:01:59,640 --> 01:02:03,089
And now it is called as ‘Benedict’.

861
01:02:03,089 --> 01:02:04,089
Just imagine!

862
01:02:04,089 --> 01:02:05,089
‘Benediction’.

863
01:02:05,089 --> 01:02:08,609
‘Benediction’ is that which gives you
Realisation.

864
01:02:08,609 --> 01:02:11,270
What Realisation does the drinking give you?

865
01:02:11,270 --> 01:02:12,300
I don’t know.

866
01:02:12,300 --> 01:02:17,740
Only thing I have seen [is] that people fall
on the streets, they talk like stupid people.

867
01:02:17,740 --> 01:02:20,480
You don’t know what to do with them.

868
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:22,009
It’s most embarrassing.

869
01:02:22,009 --> 01:02:29,059
So this is what is dharma is, that is just
enlightens you and you enjoy your virtues.

870
01:02:29,059 --> 01:02:32,670
Not your weaknesses but your virtues.

871
01:02:32,670 --> 01:02:33,950
And you enjoy the virtues of others.

872
01:02:33,950 --> 01:02:37,640
That’s what is dharma that has to be enlightened.

873
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:40,150
May God Bless you!

874
01:02:40,150 --> 01:02:44,420
You have to just put your hands just like
this, just like this.

875
01:02:44,420 --> 01:02:50,599
Put both the feet on the ground.

876
01:02:50,599 --> 01:02:53,740
Please close your eyes.

877
01:02:53,740 --> 01:02:59,720
According to the way the Kundalini is moving,
which I know on my own Kundalini, I will ask

878
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:01,150
you a few things.

879
01:03:01,150 --> 01:03:09,780
Please try to do them with earnestness and
alertness.

880
01:03:09,780 --> 01:03:14,590
Now, I have to request you to forgive everyone.

881
01:03:14,590 --> 01:03:19,190
Forgive everyone: those who have troubled
you, tortured you, have made you unhappy,

882
01:03:19,190 --> 01:03:20,190
anyone.

883
01:03:20,190 --> 01:03:21,190
You just say, “I forgive."

884
01:03:21,190 --> 01:03:22,190
Is very important.

885
01:03:22,190 --> 01:03:24,839
Just try to forgive.

886
01:03:24,839 --> 01:03:26,950
Say, “I forgive.

887
01:03:26,950 --> 01:03:29,069
Mother, I forgive.

888
01:03:29,069 --> 01:03:39,430
I forgive all of them, all the people who
have tortured me."

889
01:03:39,430 --> 01:03:42,059
Just say that from your heart.

890
01:03:42,059 --> 01:03:45,400
Please say that, “I forgive."

891
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:48,089
Please close your eyes.

892
01:03:48,089 --> 01:03:52,740
You have to be honest to yourself.

893
01:03:52,740 --> 01:03:55,759
Just say that, “I forgive."

894
01:03:55,759 --> 01:03:58,089
Only saying is sufficient.

895
01:03:58,089 --> 01:03:59,509
Only saying.

896
01:03:59,509 --> 01:04:02,059
But say with the heart.

897
01:04:02,059 --> 01:04:09,130
It will help you a lot if you can say that.

898
01:04:09,130 --> 01:04:11,400
Forgive everyone.

899
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:14,819
Everyone you forgive.

900
01:04:14,819 --> 01:04:20,470
When you forgive everyone, actually you leave
it into the hands of God to punish them or

901
01:04:20,470 --> 01:04:21,470
do whatever they like.

902
01:04:21,470 --> 01:04:23,660
And that’s the best [way] to manage the
thing.

903
01:04:23,660 --> 01:04:25,589
Just say, “I forgive."

904
01:04:25,589 --> 01:04:35,009
Best thing is to leave it to God to do the
job whatever it is.

905
01:04:35,009 --> 01:04:44,980
You don’t take the load.

906
01:04:44,980 --> 01:04:46,940
They may be nasty.

907
01:04:46,940 --> 01:04:48,900
They may be horrid.

908
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:50,960
They might have tortured you.

909
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:51,960
Doesn’t matter.

910
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:52,960
Just say.

911
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:54,769
Even Christ said that.

912
01:04:54,769 --> 01:04:57,150
Just again, please say it.

913
01:04:57,150 --> 01:05:09,830
Close your eyes and say it, because if you
do not forgive also, what do you do?

914
01:05:09,830 --> 01:05:12,950
You are playing into their hands.

915
01:05:12,950 --> 01:05:21,380
Nothing is harmed, they are not harmed by
your not forgiving them.

916
01:05:21,380 --> 01:05:23,870
It’s you [who] are harmed.

917
01:05:23,870 --> 01:05:28,500
Because you are remembering all that, you
are harming yourself.

918
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:29,500
You are tortured by that.

919
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:30,990
You are torturing yourself not they.

920
01:05:30,990 --> 01:05:36,150
Now the second thing you have to ask [for]
is the forgiveness, yourself.

921
01:05:36,150 --> 01:05:37,500
Because might be some mistakes must have been
committed.

922
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:39,009
By mistake you might have done something wrong,
something unrighteous.

923
01:05:39,009 --> 01:05:46,030
In seeking, you might have done something
wrong.

924
01:05:46,030 --> 01:05:51,830
So just ask for God to forgive you, that’s
all.

925
01:05:51,830 --> 01:05:58,109
You put your right hand on your heart and
ask for forgiveness.

926
01:05:58,109 --> 01:05:59,390
It will be better.

927
01:05:59,390 --> 01:06:05,930
Left hand towards me and right hand on the
heart.

928
01:06:05,930 --> 01:06:11,720
Now, [while] asking this, you must know that
He is the ocean of compassion.

929
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:19,259
He is the ocean of forgiveness and He is the
ocean of love and He is anxious for you to

930
01:06:19,259 --> 01:06:22,220
enter into His Kingdom.

931
01:06:22,220 --> 01:06:30,430
He is the One who wants the culmination of
His Creation into a beautiful happening by

932
01:06:30,430 --> 01:06:33,980
which He gives you the complete joy of your
being.

933
01:06:33,980 --> 01:06:44,420
So you just ask for His forgiveness but do
not feel guilty about anything.

934
01:06:44,420 --> 01:06:49,640
Whatever has happened, has happened, is forgiven.

935
01:06:49,640 --> 01:06:57,839
So you just say that, “If there is anything,
please forgive."

936
01:06:57,839 --> 01:07:01,569
But do not feel guilty.

937
01:07:01,569 --> 01:07:09,019
I think best thing is to say, “I’m not
guilty."

938
01:07:09,019 --> 01:07:15,829
Again and again to say that, “I am not guilty."

939
01:07:15,829 --> 01:07:22,460
Because that’s a very common practice here,
to feel guilty.

940
01:07:22,460 --> 01:07:23,460
Let Him judge you.

941
01:07:23,460 --> 01:07:24,460
Not to feel guilty at all is very important.

942
01:07:24,460 --> 01:07:25,460
Please tell yourself thrice that, “I am
not guilty."

943
01:07:25,460 --> 01:07:26,890
Now the Kundalini will rise and you will feel
absolutely thoughtless.

944
01:07:26,890 --> 01:07:28,329
There’s no thought in your mind.

945
01:07:28,329 --> 01:07:29,329
You’ll see that.

946
01:07:29,329 --> 01:07:31,830
Just see it: is there any thought in your
mind.
