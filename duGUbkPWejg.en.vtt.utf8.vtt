00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:49.840
Today, we have decided to worship the Yogeshwara.
I think that is the greatest name of Shri

00:02:49.840 --> 00:03:04.010
Krishna for us. That means He is the Ishwara
of yoga. Yoga means the union ,as you know,

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:13.770
with the divine. But also yoga has another
meaning which means yukti. In English language

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:29.730
to translate it properly is not possible.
Yukti means the trick. but trick is always

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:36.170
connected with something funny and bad. But
this 'yukti' means the technique. But 'technique'

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:44.840
is mechanical. So I couldn't find any proper
word for 'yukti'. But one can say that: to

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:54.030
know the technique and the trick of the technique
is also another meaning of yoga - yukti.

00:03:54.030 --> 00:04:05.770
So, even if you are connected, if you do not
know the trick of the union then it is useless,

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:17.660
it is of no avail. So what one has to learn,
after getting realization, is not only the

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:28.160
technique but the trick of the technique.
At Krishna's level when we reach - it is an

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:37.850
incarnation after Shri Rama's. So Shri Rama
came as a 'Maryada Purushottama', which means

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:54.660
a person who is a complete ideal of maryadas
and a benevolent king.

00:04:54.660 --> 00:05:03.590
But in the case of Shri Krishna it was a different
phase because people had become extremely

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:16.390
serious, very disciplined, and were leading
a life which was, we can say, over-dharmic.

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:28.480
And this had put the people at a level, fixed,
and they thought that "If we are doing all

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:35.400
these things every day then it's alright.
We have reached the last." So Shri Krishna

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:47.310
had to come - Himself, Shri Vishnu, came as
Shri Krishna - to tell us about the ascent,

00:05:47.310 --> 00:06:00.400
and that - all this is just a play. But only
a person who is a master of the play can do

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.480
the play.

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:12.780
So to know the play. Supposing you have communication,
you have electrical communications. Now you

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:23.200
don't know how to play with it - play. Not
how to know or how to connect but to play.

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:33.060
Supposing only you know all the technique,
then it becomes quite a headache, because

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:38.720
all the time you think you are doing it. You
have to do this and, this is to be done, that

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:45.900
has to be done, and this connection is not
all right; that should be properly connected.

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:55.200
You get tired and bored. But if it's a play
for you, just a play. For any master it's

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:57.460
a play.

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:05.590
If it's just a play for you, then you don't
feel tired - it's fun, it's fun. And that

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:11.980
is what is Leela, that's why He is called
'Leeladhara' - because He is a master. He

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:29.230
came as a master, master not as a guru, but
master of all the arts of this yoga, yukti.

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:43.780
So He is so deft, He's so capable, that for
Him it's a play. All this is a play for Him.

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:51.919
And this is what one has to know, that, in
yoga, everything that you do should be just

00:07:51.919 --> 00:08:03.520
a play. Say, getting up at 5 o'clock in the
morning, should be a play.

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:12.860
In the morning you get up. The sun has not
yet come, to suggest what you have to do,

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:24.120
and the moon has departed, and in that twilight
or a little darkness if you get up, it's very

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:34.110
beautiful. And at that time you sit down for
your dhyaan. But it's not a serious thing,

00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:44.779
it's not something that is boring, it's a
play. But for that you have to be a master.

00:08:44.779 --> 00:08:52.710
If you are the master of yoga, then it's a
play. So first Shri Rama's state has to be

00:08:52.710 --> 00:09:07.220
there where you become really a Vishwa Nirmala
Dharmi - so that it becomes your play.

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:17.960
Now communication with the Divine has to go
to the whole world. The whole world has to

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:29.070
get this communication that you have received.
For this part Shri Krishna arranged something

00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:42.670
in His lifetime in a very simple way, as a
child. It looks, very childlike. Like when

00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:49.380
the Gopi's were taking their baths He hid
their clothes - I mean, Indian women are never

00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:57.510
fully nude, never - He hid their saris and
all that and He could see their back, this

00:09:57.510 --> 00:10:06.200
little boy. What is for a little boy? He's
sitting on a tree and is trying to raise their

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:15.420
Kundalini. They're coming out of the river
Jamuna which is being vibrated by Radha. Already

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:21.050
there are vibrations, you see - raising their
Kundalini.

00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:30.810
Then they are taking the water and He breaks
their pitchers, from the back, which have

00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:40.360
also got vibrated water in. So the vibrated
water falls on the backs of these ladies and

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:53.080
He tries to awaken their Kundalini. See the
play of a child, how He tried to play in His

00:10:53.080 --> 00:11:04.029
childhood, just like a child. And then He
shows, later on, His child-like expertise

00:11:04.029 --> 00:11:14.839
in dealing with politics, dealing with people,
with communication and everything. And His

00:11:14.839 --> 00:11:21.840
power was Radha, Radha 'Ra' 'dha' . 'Ra' means
energy, 'Dha' means the one which sustains

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:27.319
- 'Ra-dha'. So the "Dha Re Di Dha Sa Ma" (???) as
they say. In the same way Radha 'Ra' 'Dha'

00:11:27.319 --> 00:11:32.180
- the one who sustains the energy.

00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:40.160
So the first quality that He got from Her
is - She's the 'Alaahda Dayini'. I couldn't

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:48.440
find a word in English for 'Alaahd'. 'Alaahd'
is when you suddenly see something nice and

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:59.020
joy starts. Just feel very happy. I mean,
there are very few words in English, as you

00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:09.640
know, for joy or at the most happiness. But
'Alaahd' is a kind of a joy which, as you

00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:16.860
get the fresh air - then how you feel. That
is Alaahd. So She is 'Alaahda Dayini'. She's

00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:20.459
the one who is the giver of Alaahd.

00:12:20.459 --> 00:12:30.680
And so with Her powers, He could work out
this Alaahd to all the people with whom He

00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:38.630
was connected. So all the Gopas and Gopis
who were with Him had to do Rasa. 'Ra' is

00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:45.890
'energy', 'Sa' means 'with'. To dance with
the energy that is Radhaji. He used to just

00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:53.910
play the flute and She used to dance, the
energy used to pass through Her hands to all

00:12:53.910 --> 00:13:03.440
the other people and the Kundalini would be
awakened. So this was another play that He

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:15.480
had. So in the play only He raised the Kundalini.
But in modern times it's very difficult, it

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:27.660
is not easy to raise Kundalinis in modern
times in that way. I mean, nobody will understand

00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:32.120
also.

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:39.680
So in modern times when Sahaja Yoga is not
just raising the Kundalini but giving the

00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:49.880
complete knowledge about Sahaja Yoga and also
empowering the person with the power to give

00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:56.769
others realization, it was tremendous task.
And that's why we had to find out these methods

00:13:56.769 --> 00:14:06.790
by which we could give realization to people.
In those days Kundalinis were awakened but

00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:13.890
the Sahasrara was not broken. So Kundalini
must be somewhere hanging in the agnya, maybe

00:14:13.890 --> 00:14:23.600
at heart, maybe somewhere. And such people
became the seekers and that's how we find,

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:31.959
today, people are here as Sahaja Yogis whose
Sahasrara's are open and they know all the

00:14:31.959 --> 00:14:33.890
yukti of Sahaja Yoga.

00:14:33.890 --> 00:14:44.000
But there are subtler and subtler yuktis of
Sahaja Yoga which you have to master. The

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:55.800
first is that His character was 'madhuriya',
meaning the sweetness. Sweetness. We always

00:14:55.800 --> 00:15:09.970
say, "He's sweet like honey". So when He talked
to anyone or He communicated with anyone,

00:15:09.970 --> 00:15:23.050
it was through sweetness; and this communication,
if you have not developed, then you are nowhere

00:15:23.050 --> 00:15:42.890
near Yoga. To talk to someone sweetly, automatically.
Everything is madhuriya for Him, His talking,

00:15:42.890 --> 00:15:49.649
His actions, His face. Everything is madhuriya.

00:15:49.649 --> 00:15:55.950
So when we talk of communications first of
all the greatest thing is the communication

00:15:55.950 --> 00:16:04.670
between human beings and when we have to think
of the communication with the human beings

00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:14.680
many people think that by aggression you will
communicate better, which is not true. I mean

00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:23.500
if somebody wants to get something out of
someone, say; so you go there and just talk,

00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:32.769
"I have to have! How can you do it? This,
that!" As it is - it's no good. But if you

00:16:32.769 --> 00:16:46.640
are sweet and start talking sweetly then 99%
will definitely dissolve. So to dissolve people

00:16:46.640 --> 00:17:00.820
with sweetness - how to do it - that trick
one has to learn: how, with sweetness, you

00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:12.220
can dissolve people. This is one of His special
qualities, that you talk to someone in such

00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:26.269
a manner, genuinely, in a very sweet manner,
and the problem between you and that person

00:17:26.269 --> 00:17:30.639
will be dissolved, absolutely.

00:17:30.639 --> 00:17:38.039
Now there are many tricks and how to talk
to someone is one of the biggest things one

00:17:38.039 --> 00:17:44.869
has to learn. First of all you must always
show that you are less intelligent than another

00:17:44.869 --> 00:17:58.509
person. Like if I'm talking to a scientist
I will say, "I'm sorry I don't know any science

00:17:58.509 --> 00:18:15.720
you know. I'm no good for a scientist." So
they feel "ahhhh, very good." If you have

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:25.389
to talk to some musician, you must say "I
don't know any music. No, I just have learned

00:18:25.389 --> 00:18:31.869
a little bit, but not much." Musician feels
very happy. You may call it a pampering of

00:18:31.869 --> 00:18:40.049
the ego. You may call it [that]. But there's
no harm in saying that "I'm nothing to compared

00:18:40.049 --> 00:18:44.950
to you".

00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:53.230
So the first trick is complete humility when
you talk to another person. It's the sign

00:18:53.230 --> 00:19:01.429
of greatness, it's the sign of fulfilment.
As the trees, when they are laden with fruits

00:19:01.429 --> 00:19:13.210
they bend down. So, first of all, if you say
"I am no one. I don't understand anything

00:19:13.210 --> 00:19:23.789
but I would like to hear" this is first. The
first quality of communication is to be extremely

00:19:23.789 --> 00:19:34.519
humble about yourself. The other person should
not know who you are. And there's a lot of

00:19:34.519 --> 00:19:45.519
fun in it. Say for example now - I can say
about Myself that My husband was very highly

00:19:45.519 --> 00:19:55.749
placed in India. But I met a friend in Delhi
- she was studying with Me in school and in

00:19:55.749 --> 00:20:00.159
college - and She asked Me "where do you live?"
So, I told her, "In Meenabagh," which was

00:20:00.159 --> 00:20:06.259
just a useless, small, little place meant
for very ordinary officers because they had

00:20:06.259 --> 00:20:11.359
not allotted us any house or anything so,
temporarily, we were there. She said "what?

00:20:11.359 --> 00:20:16.869
What is your husband doing?" I said "He's
some governments servant." I didn't tell her

00:20:16.869 --> 00:20:26.330
[his position]! He came down, so he just looked
at Me and he smiled. She said "do you know

00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:32.710
him?" I said "He's My husband". She was shocked,
"He's your husband? Oh my God! Why didn't

00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:38.799
you tell me?" Immediately the whole thing
changed and she felt so ashamed of herself.

00:20:38.799 --> 00:20:49.129
She had started looking down upon Me, "Ah,
Married to some clerk or someone."

00:20:49.129 --> 00:20:59.960
So the best thing is to play down. Play down
everything. Now I know of certain Sahaja Yogis

00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:06.830
they say, "oh Mother has giving me such powers.
I can do this, I can do that." This boastfullness

00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:13.210
is of no use. "I haven't got any powers you
see. I'm just a Sahaja Yogi that's all. But

00:21:13.210 --> 00:21:33.070
if you want I can try." So play down as much
as you can. Practice this at home, first practice

00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:41.899
and then do it. So that is one of the greatest
qualities of communication with others.

00:21:41.899 --> 00:21:48.749
Second thing: I think in the whole of Gita,
if you read it, there's one is very important

00:21:48.749 --> 00:21:50.269
thing. He says " "krodho'bhijaayate sammohah"
[ The actual Gita quote is - "kaamaat krodho'bhijaayate,

00:21:50.269 --> 00:21:52.229
Krodhaad bhavati sammohah" - from desire comes
anger, from anger comes delusion (Gita 2:61)].

00:21:52.229 --> 00:22:04.729
You see among all the worst things that we
have - according to Him we have six enemies.

00:22:04.729 --> 00:22:14.899
But in Gita He started with 'Krodha'. He said
- it starts with Krodha, means anger.

00:22:14.899 --> 00:22:22.259
If you have anger within you then you are
not a master at all. There's no need for a

00:22:22.259 --> 00:22:32.289
master to get angry because he can play about.
He can make you dance like this. What is the

00:22:32.289 --> 00:22:40.330
need to lose your temper? But that mastery
if you don't have, of handling people, then

00:22:40.330 --> 00:22:48.269
after five/six minutes of talk your voice
starts raising and something starts barking

00:22:48.269 --> 00:22:55.590
- because that temper is still inside you,
burning.

00:22:55.590 --> 00:23:07.379
But for a master there should be no temper
- no need. He has started with Krodha, that:

00:23:07.379 --> 00:23:13.229
with the Krodha all problems start - from
one to another to another to another.

00:23:13.229 --> 00:23:27.999
So we should watch out if we are angry people.
Anger comes from Vishuddhi. Starts from liver

00:23:27.999 --> 00:23:35.609
- Vishnu - but is expressed through Vishuddhi.
The face becomes red, eyes become red. From

00:23:35.609 --> 00:23:42.330
the mouth you start saying all kinds of horrible
things and the whole expression becomes so

00:23:42.330 --> 00:23:46.159
different when you are angry.

00:23:46.159 --> 00:23:53.239
So this anger is to be seen, "Where is it
within us? Where is it this anger? Liver?

00:23:53.239 --> 00:23:55.419
alright, I'll put it right."

00:23:55.419 --> 00:24:02.799
So to master it you have to face yourself
clearly. Many people I have seen people say

00:24:02.799 --> 00:24:07.929
"Mother you know this lady is such a hot tempered
women, she is so dominating. She does this,

00:24:07.929 --> 00:24:13.649
she does that." But if you tell her she says,
"No no, I don't do that way. No, no I'm very

00:24:13.649 --> 00:24:20.639
good." "But how other's saying that?", "I
don't know but I'm very good" - finished!

00:24:20.639 --> 00:24:29.450
If somebody is saying that then you watch
yourself - do you get into tempers or not?

00:24:29.450 --> 00:24:35.479
Are you loosing your temper? It's very easy
to make it out then face it. So the trick

00:24:35.479 --> 00:24:44.669
of the trade is to face yourself and see for
yourself how much you are lacking. So first

00:24:44.669 --> 00:24:57.149
is humility, which should be genuine, and
secondly is equanimity - no temper. There

00:24:57.149 --> 00:25:03.369
is no need to take to temper. At the most
you can say "What are you doing? Why are you

00:25:03.369 --> 00:25:07.899
doing that way?" Now if you do something,
you know, maybe something I might say which

00:25:07.899 --> 00:25:16.080
I would not like, so I don't want to say."
Like that - at the most! Up to that point

00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:25.669
is alright; that you should say that, "I dislike
it", but not to go further with it.

00:25:25.669 --> 00:25:36.549
If you just stop at a point, then this habit
of getting into temper will go away. This

00:25:36.549 --> 00:25:43.289
arrogance will go away, which has to go. This
arrogance has to go, this temper has to go.

00:25:43.289 --> 00:25:49.509
And then, you'll be surprised, you will feel
very much relieved. Because this anger, once

00:25:49.509 --> 00:25:57.029
it comes in, reacts, and catches your left
Vishuddi, and you become guilty, you feel

00:25:57.029 --> 00:26:05.330
very bad - "Why I said so, I should not have
said this." So Vishuddi's finished, left Vishuddhi,

00:26:05.330 --> 00:26:13.749
means - it's a headache. It goes on accumulating
like a store house there - all your anger,

00:26:13.749 --> 00:26:21.190
temper whatever you have - and this left Vishuddhi
catches, and you know the problems of left

00:26:21.190 --> 00:26:22.950
Vishuddhi.

00:26:22.950 --> 00:26:32.440
So if you get angry with someone, don't feel
guilty but go before the mirror and slap yourself

00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:38.909
nicely, twice. Now you get angry with yourself,
"let me get angry!" Then stand before the

00:26:38.909 --> 00:26:44.909
mirror, "shoo shoo shoo" [Mother pretends
to punch herself! Everybody laughs], like

00:26:44.909 --> 00:26:53.179
that. In the same manner as you get angry
try to act, you'll never feel guilty. Or maybe

00:26:53.179 --> 00:27:02.989
more angry - would be better. So you empty
out your left Vishuddhi. Next time you won't

00:27:02.989 --> 00:27:09.159
do it. But feeling guilty means you will repeat
and repeat and repeat the same thing.

00:27:09.159 --> 00:27:17.889
So this temper is expressed by men and women
differently. And I'm very much worried about

00:27:17.889 --> 00:27:24.960
the women sometimes because they take to water
power - then I'm lost. But those who have

00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:32.159
ego too much, cry much more. That's the sign,
I've seen. If you say anything to them immediately

00:27:32.159 --> 00:27:41.359
they start crying, because already the left
Vishuddhi is there, full, like a full balloon

00:27:41.359 --> 00:27:47.029
and when you touch them it becomes water.

00:27:47.029 --> 00:27:53.309
But men, their temper is a different style,
as you know very well, that: when they get

00:27:53.309 --> 00:27:59.999
angry they might fight with each other, box
everyone and then settle down nicely and have

00:27:59.999 --> 00:28:09.249
something to drink. "Let us have it out!"
you see, they'll say. Take out. But women

00:28:09.249 --> 00:28:14.549
don't, they keep it there and once they keep
it then it becomes tears, it starts coming

00:28:14.549 --> 00:28:22.830
down. So, if these are just tears out of joy,
happiness, that's different, or out of feelings

00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:28.729
for others - but it is not that, but it's
tears just to impress another person that

00:28:28.729 --> 00:28:42.469
you are very sad or something.

00:28:42.469 --> 00:28:52.849
So the second trick is how to master your
own temper and the third one is how to master

00:28:52.849 --> 00:29:03.969
the temper of others - that's even better.
I don't know if I have told you the trick

00:29:03.969 --> 00:29:10.599
of Gagangan Maharaj, when I went to him. He
is a very hot tempered avadhuta, sitting on

00:29:10.599 --> 00:29:14.960
a tiger, and he's lost his legs, because he
was feeling hot so he was sitting in the water

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:21.309
all the time, so his feet are useless and
he goes on a tiger, they say. I never saw

00:29:21.309 --> 00:29:26.539
the tiger, of course. But he knows about Me
and all that and he told everyone about Me

00:29:26.539 --> 00:29:33.139
so I went to see him. And he's supposed to
control the rain. It was quite a steep climb

00:29:33.139 --> 00:29:40.649
for about one and a half hours. And as soon
as I stepped in, it started raining, raining,

00:29:40.649 --> 00:29:47.559
raining heavily throughout and he couldn't
stop it, so he felt very challenged! When

00:29:47.559 --> 00:29:51.979
I went up he was sitting on his own stone
outside the cave, and he was doing like this

00:29:51.979 --> 00:29:57.899
[twisting his head], with anger. He didn't
know what to do. I looked at him then I walked

00:29:57.899 --> 00:30:04.779
into his cave and sat down nicely, then he
came, they brought him. He touched my feet,

00:30:04.779 --> 00:30:10.509
everything he did and then he said, "You tell
me now - why did you not allow me to stop

00:30:10.509 --> 00:30:17.559
the water? You got completely drenched. I'm
very angry with this rain I know. But why

00:30:17.559 --> 00:30:24.509
did you do that? Is it to control my ego?"
I said "No, not at all I never knew you had

00:30:24.509 --> 00:30:35.369
ego or anything," "Then why?" So - because
I'm a master as you know - I said "You see

00:30:35.369 --> 00:30:42.340
you are a sanyasi and you brought a sari for
Me, that too of an orange colour, and I would

00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:45.710
not take the orange colour sari from you.
Any sari I wouldn't take, because you're a

00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:54.729
sanyasi. But I had to get drenched to get
the sari, isn't it?" Immediately - he melted

00:30:54.729 --> 00:30:55.469
away.

00:30:55.469 --> 00:31:10.009
But I had to be the master. First of all how
to melt him and secondly the master of his

00:31:10.009 --> 00:31:20.190
mind. This is the subtler part of it. You
can be a master of a person. Like that you

00:31:20.190 --> 00:31:27.909
can know what he has done for you, what he
has prepared for you, what is coming for you.

00:31:27.909 --> 00:31:34.139
I wouldn't say that you'd know all the whole
future. But if you try just to know about

00:31:34.139 --> 00:31:42.149
a person - you can know everything about that
person, very simple. So first try to understand

00:31:42.149 --> 00:31:46.309
a person.

00:31:46.309 --> 00:31:55.269
My father had lots of tricks with him, I know,
and a very humorous person. And one day My

00:31:55.269 --> 00:32:02.639
brother told me, Babamama, that he has a friend
who sings very well. So I asked my father

00:32:02.639 --> 00:32:08.679
"How does he sing?" "Oh, he is very courageous,"
he said. I said "Why?" "He sings whether he

00:32:08.679 --> 00:32:15.889
knows or not - that's the trouble!" What an
exact description he gave Me of this gentleman!

00:32:15.889 --> 00:32:21.749
"He's very courageous you see. He doesn't
know but he sings - quite alright, so he's

00:32:21.749 --> 00:32:27.659
very courageous." I mean, he didn't say anything
against him - he said "He's courageous" - but

00:32:27.659 --> 00:32:31.149
he gave Me the complete picture of the gentleman
that: "You have to be careful you see, he

00:32:31.149 --> 00:32:36.269
might start singing in a funny way, you shouldn't
laugh." And, all that came in that 'courageous'

00:32:36.269 --> 00:32:37.479
word.

00:32:37.479 --> 00:32:50.159
In the same way, if you study someone then
you will just describe that person in an interesting

00:32:50.159 --> 00:32:55.119
way, and you will not feel that this person
has these bad habits or those bad habits or

00:32:55.119 --> 00:33:02.429
this is wrong with him, that is wrong, but
you'll describe - it's part of that person.

00:33:02.429 --> 00:33:11.369
It's a way of knowing a person in totality
with all his defects, with all his qualities,

00:33:11.369 --> 00:33:17.080
with everything and accepting that person
as he is.

00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:25.369
If that mastery you can have. Now how will
you have? If your attention is not on his

00:33:25.369 --> 00:33:34.960
qualities you'll only know his bad things.
And if you know his qualities then bad things

00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:41.710
will be there, a little bit, but they'll just
be adding a little masala to his character.

00:33:41.710 --> 00:33:51.489
You'll feel "ahhhh, that's it, you see, he
is a little bit like that." Little additional

00:33:51.489 --> 00:33:58.200
swara (musical note) is added to his character.
And you wouldn't mind it so much, such a person.

00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:00.379
You'll really enjoy.

00:34:00.379 --> 00:34:06.719
Like my son-in-law is very fond of dogs and
his wife says, "no dog in the house," it's

00:34:06.719 --> 00:34:12.090
a flat. So there is a fight between them for
the dog. So Prabhat said "You never meet me,"

00:34:12.090 --> 00:34:19.560
I said "This is not proper but next time I
have decided to be a dog," Immediately he

00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:21.780
took the point, you see.

00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:29.880
So the way you talk to a person you can suggest
to him what is so special about that person

00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:40.370
or the defects of that person. But you need
not say directly something to him. If you

00:34:40.370 --> 00:34:52.919
say indirectly, in such a humorous manner
that the person will understand. So in communication

00:34:52.919 --> 00:35:02.270
with others you have to be a very humorous
person. But mostly I've seen people have humour

00:35:02.270 --> 00:35:08.570
if somebody cannot walk straight. If a physical
problem is there they'll laugh. If he has

00:35:08.570 --> 00:35:15.520
not properly made his hair then they will
laugh. On some sort of a very superficial

00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:22.770
thing they laugh. This is not humorous. This
is some sort of a criticism in laughter. Or

00:35:22.770 --> 00:35:32.380
some people have a humour like this that they
say sarcastic things, that's no good. You

00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:38.230
say one word to somebody, sarcastic; you think
you are brilliant, but you are lost forever

00:35:38.230 --> 00:35:43.400
for that person. That person will remember
"He said such a such things to me."

00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:50.410
So sarcasm is against you completely; against
Sahaja Yoga. If you have to say something,

00:35:50.410 --> 00:36:02.460
say it in such a manner that it doesn't hurt
the person, and the person enjoys that subtle

00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:16.100
humour and understands also that "This is
the problem with me". Now in a humorous way,

00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:22.880
if I have to tell something to you - I need
not tell you directly, "You are like this,

00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:31.360
you are like that," but I'll say, "There was
one crow which came to my house..." and, like

00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:37.290
that, I can transfer all your qualities to
that crow and describe to you and say that,

00:36:37.290 --> 00:36:43.400
"This crow did like this and did that." Immediately
you'll start thinking, "Is it about me Mother

00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:47.860
was saying or about the crow?"

00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:55.140
So transfer it to somebody else. Transfer
it to somebody else, that's the best way.

00:36:55.140 --> 00:37:00.010
For example, if you want to say that: all
the names of the people who are coming to

00:37:00.010 --> 00:37:07.130
the puja should be there at the right time.
So now, this time, Americans [are hosting].

00:37:07.130 --> 00:37:11.040
Alright, "Americans have sent the word..."
- they have not - "...have sent the word that

00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:19.080
all the names should be there." No harm telling
such lies, no harm. So that people will not

00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:23.490
put it on you, they'll not be angry with you.
At the most they'll be angry with the Americans

00:37:23.490 --> 00:37:33.710
- doesn't matter, for the time being. So transfer
it. And this transference is 'astantar' as

00:37:33.710 --> 00:37:42.240
they call it. To transfer from one hand to
another hand, Shri Krishna was an expert.

00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:52.250
There is a story about Him. He is called as
Ranchordas, means He ran away from the battlefield.

00:37:52.250 --> 00:38:01.400
He doesn't mind "I ran away, so what?" The
reason was like this: there was a very bad

00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:10.610
rakshasa who had all kinds of boons from Brahmadeva
and Shri Krishna didn't know how to overcome

00:38:10.610 --> 00:38:16.510
that, nobody knew, and He was killing so many
people. So He thought of a trick, transfer

00:38:16.510 --> 00:38:26.760
it to somebody else. He knew of another great
yogi you see, special type, who has meditated

00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:36.980
and taken a boon from the same Brahmadeva
that: "If I'm sleeping and anybody disturbs

00:38:36.980 --> 00:38:44.260
my sleep and, if I open my eyes and look at
that person, that person should become ashes

00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:48.010
- bhasma (ashes)."

00:38:48.010 --> 00:38:54.210
So Shri Krishna thought of Him, "Better transfer
the job from me to Him." So He started running

00:38:54.210 --> 00:39:02.960
away from the field. So this Rakshasa also
followed Him. Then Shri Krishna stealthily

00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:16.100
went into the cave of this avadhuta, and put
His own shawl on top of Him, covered Him,

00:39:16.100 --> 00:39:23.450
and hid himself in the cave. Now this Rakshasa
came here, he thought this was Shri Krishna

00:39:23.450 --> 00:39:28.730
who was sleeping, "Ahhh now you are tired,
you are sleeping. Now I'm going to see how

00:39:28.730 --> 00:39:35.640
you can save yourself." And he started waking
[him] up. This avadhuta got up and looked

00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:39.520
at him and he became bhasma.

00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:52.530
So transfer your jobs to a more capable (Shri
Mataji laughs) person who can do this better,

00:39:52.530 --> 00:39:57.430
than taking upon yourself straight-forward,
going, "Alright,come long, I'll fight with

00:39:57.430 --> 00:40:06.750
you" - you cannot win. It's a guerrilla warfare
as you call it. Transfer it, and you can transfer

00:40:06.750 --> 00:40:14.080
it to somebody, you can make friends with
that person, pamper his ego; do what you like.

00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:22.200
But the main point is that you should get
rid of the ills, the bad, the rakshasas. So

00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:25.960
you can transfer it to anyone.

00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:46.890
And so many tricks He played. In the Mahabharata,
Bhishma had a blessing that, unless and until

00:40:46.890 --> 00:41:04.760
he wants to die, nobody can kill him. So Shri
Krishna decided that He should use some tricks.

00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:14.730
So He told Arjuna that you put him...He told
Arjuna not himself; He was just doing the

00:41:14.730 --> 00:41:27.150
chariot drivers job - Sarathi. So Krishna
told him that you just make him sleep on the

00:41:27.150 --> 00:41:38.130
arrows, let His body be on the arrows and
he has to decide that he will die. But Dronacharya

00:41:38.130 --> 00:41:47.740
was a great guru, also of Arjuna, who was
siding with Kauravas. Now how can you kill

00:41:47.740 --> 00:42:02.830
this Dhronacharya, big problem. Because you
see, he knew all the tricks of archery. How

00:42:02.830 --> 00:42:12.260
are you going to save them? Because archery
is such a thing that he was the master of

00:42:12.260 --> 00:42:17.700
archery, while Arjuna was his disciple.

00:42:17.700 --> 00:42:46.520
So how to stop him, answering back the arrows
of Arjuna? How to do that, that he doesn't

00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:57.390
answer back? Because he was a master. So Krishna
organized it, in a very special way. He got

00:42:57.390 --> 00:43:05.350
a Shikhandi, a eunuch. What is the advantage
of having a eunuch? Of course it's a big story

00:43:05.350 --> 00:43:15.220
how they became Shikhandi. But He got him
in front of Arjuna. A eunuch in India is regarded

00:43:15.220 --> 00:43:31.170
as a woman, so Dhronacharya said, "I cannot
kill a woman," and that's how He killed Dhronacharya.

00:43:31.170 --> 00:43:40.380
So [He played] these tricks, because to get
rid of ill is the main thing. To get rid of

00:43:40.380 --> 00:43:45.810
the ill - if you are not capable - you better
tell somebody else to get rid. Because that

00:43:45.810 --> 00:43:53.430
is very important - to get rid of the evil
- and if you can transfer this to somebody

00:43:53.430 --> 00:43:58.270
else who is more capable, in your own humility,
you'll do much better than to directly attack

00:43:58.270 --> 00:44:05.530
that person. That's Tomfoolery. No use.

00:44:05.530 --> 00:44:13.430
So this was the trick of Shri Krishna throughout,
if you have seen Mahabharata. Shri Krishna

00:44:13.430 --> 00:44:21.530
told Arjuna that, "Either you can the have
all of My army or you can have Me." Same He

00:44:21.530 --> 00:44:28.930
told to the Kauravas. The Kauravas said, "We'll
have your army." But he (Arjuna) said, "You

00:44:28.930 --> 00:44:32.700
will be mine, Krishna." He said "You'll be
on our side." But He said, "No, I'll be just

00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:41.000
on the chariot. I'll not hold any weapon."
But He is a master of tricks. He does not

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:47.350
need any weapons with Him. Without weapons
also He can do everything. So Arjuna said,

00:44:47.350 --> 00:44:53.680
"alright, You be my chariot driver," and He
was there.

00:44:53.680 --> 00:45:01.650
Because Shri Krishna knew about each and every
thing, mostly He used to smile. Now, if somebody's

00:45:01.650 --> 00:45:09.910
telling Me something, sometimes you will find
I also smile, but I try to control because

00:45:09.910 --> 00:45:16.210
I don't want them to see. But I know what
they are doing, what they're up to, what is

00:45:16.210 --> 00:45:22.050
their trick. Because you are such a trick
master you know all the tricks and you know

00:45:22.050 --> 00:45:28.870
what they are playing with you. So you just
smile about it, just to smile in a very sweet

00:45:28.870 --> 00:45:36.100
way, "ahhh, that's it. ahh ,of course, of
course, what you say is true, no doubt." But,

00:45:36.100 --> 00:45:43.860
by this kind of thing, you'll be surprised,
your communications will improve very much

00:45:43.860 --> 00:45:45.250
with others.

00:45:45.250 --> 00:45:51.700
Now some people I've seen in Sahaja Yoga - very
common, very common, "Mother, they came and

00:45:51.700 --> 00:46:00.590
told me, our leader told me, that you are
bhootish. What is bhootish?" Another one says,

00:46:00.590 --> 00:46:06.390
"But he told me that you are a bhoot," - alright.
And somebody says, "Mother no he told me that

00:46:06.390 --> 00:46:14.470
you have got a bhoot in you. Now what are
these three categories? Tell us." Why to tell

00:46:14.470 --> 00:46:21.010
anybody you are bhootish or anything? There's
no need. If you know how to correct it, just

00:46:21.010 --> 00:46:28.300
say "left Swadisthana" and correct it. Take
it out. Ask him, if he had any guru or anything.

00:46:28.300 --> 00:46:33.990
Alright, if the person is good natured and
a good person then it's even more important.

00:46:33.990 --> 00:46:38.490
You should say "It's nothing, you see, it's
just a badha from outside. We'll have to take

00:46:38.490 --> 00:46:47.390
it out." But a person who has got agnya and
all these things, plus that he has got this

00:46:47.390 --> 00:46:52.630
left Swadisthana, then, of course, you should
say, "Baba, we cannot help you," because you

00:46:52.630 --> 00:46:57.390
know he is cunning. What's the use of playing
with that?

00:46:57.390 --> 00:47:05.460
But in Sahaja Yoga we forget. Anybody who
comes "Alright, come along, come along, come

00:47:05.460 --> 00:47:13.890
along." Everybody is not capable of Sahaja
Yoga, one has to know that. Not the whole

00:47:13.890 --> 00:47:24.990
world. Sahaja Yoga can only be given to people
who are deserving, who are seekers and who

00:47:24.990 --> 00:47:32.980
are courageous - viras. It's not meant for
ordinary people. So we open our door to everyone

00:47:32.980 --> 00:47:38.820
and all such people walk in and then we work
very hard on them, do all kinds of things,

00:47:38.820 --> 00:47:49.110
and we find that they create problems for
us. So first, only deal with people who are

00:47:49.110 --> 00:47:56.000
simple, as Shri Krishna dealt with Gopas and
Gopis; and then we can see, in a collective

00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:04.750
way, if we can face somebody who's complicated.
But no use transforming Hitler or Rajneesh,

00:48:04.750 --> 00:48:06.840
not possible.

00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:12.870
So one should not try to do impossible tasks
in Sahaja Yoga, which Shri Krishna has shown

00:48:12.870 --> 00:48:23.610
in His own character by avoiding things which
He didn't want to do - no. And He did it because

00:48:23.610 --> 00:48:31.210
He was such a master. Of course, for Him,
it was not necessary to face himself to master

00:48:31.210 --> 00:48:39.050
himself, because He knew himself, He is the
Ishwara of yoga, He knew everything. When

00:48:39.050 --> 00:48:44.080
you know everything there is no need for you
to master, what are you going to master? On

00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:50.630
the contrary you sometimes get frightened
of yourself, that you know so much.

00:48:50.630 --> 00:49:00.550
So, best is that, when we are dealing as human
beings in Sahaja Yoga, we have to know ourselves

00:49:00.550 --> 00:49:07.680
very well - "Now oh that's my speciality."
In that you have to see: "How I face myself

00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:19.940
all the time? Why do I say such a thing? What
is lurking in my mind?" Negativity is something

00:49:19.940 --> 00:49:22.410
to be seen very clearly within yourself.

00:49:22.410 --> 00:49:28.500
As I must have told you so many examples that
the western negativity is like this that,

00:49:28.500 --> 00:49:39.290
their minds are all the time labor saving
devices. They don't like to work anyway. For

00:49:39.290 --> 00:49:49.380
example, you tell them "You go and telephone
to someone." Immediately they will tell you

00:49:49.380 --> 00:49:54.370
ten explanations: he may not be there, his
wife will shout, he might have gone to work,

00:49:54.370 --> 00:50:07.050
it's ten o'clock, this, that. But if you telephone
he's there, but they won't telephone. Hundred

00:50:07.050 --> 00:50:15.260
excuses. Now new excuses have started: "the
computer was not working, fax was not working."

00:50:15.260 --> 00:50:23.510
Except for your brain everything works. But
the other way around it is: your brain is

00:50:23.510 --> 00:50:29.670
not working and everything is not working.
"The lights were not working." I mean, whatever

00:50:29.670 --> 00:50:41.260
it is. But you must learn, "Why can't I find
the solution? I must do something."

00:50:41.260 --> 00:50:48.980
Like I have told you, the tip of a root - how
it manages to go round and round and seek

00:50:48.980 --> 00:50:54.460
the source of water. In the same way, are
we doing something about it? Alright, if this

00:50:54.460 --> 00:51:00.350
is not available, do that, if that is not
available do this. Out of nothing you can

00:51:00.350 --> 00:51:06.520
do so many things. But if you want to find
out all the time "That cannot be done, that

00:51:06.520 --> 00:51:15.390
cannot be done". [That was] not [the case]
with Shri Krishna! After all He was the incarnation

00:51:15.390 --> 00:51:19.450
of Virata, the Master of Masters we should
say.

00:51:19.450 --> 00:51:25.660
Like when Draupadi was in trouble - Draupadi
was actually Vishnumaya His sister - She thought

00:51:25.660 --> 00:51:32.750
of Shri Krishna. She was holding onto her
sari, when it was pulled out by Duryodhana.

00:51:32.750 --> 00:51:39.140
And She was holding it like this (with Her
teeth). "Kri", She wanted to say "Krishna"

00:51:39.140 --> 00:51:48.820
but She thought, "If I say 'shna' it will
fall down." So She was holding on. As soon

00:51:48.820 --> 00:51:59.900
as She dropped it, "shna", sari dropped out
(of Her mouth), then it's described, about

00:51:59.900 --> 00:52:10.240
Shri Krishna, "Dwarika me shora bhayo, shor
bhayo bhare. Shankha chakra gadaa padma, Garuda

00:52:10.240 --> 00:52:16.580
laysidhare." [Meaning:] that sound went into
Dwarika. Now where is Dwarika and where is

00:52:16.580 --> 00:52:25.980
Hastinapur - at least a distance of two thousands
miles [apart]. But the sound went through

00:52:25.980 --> 00:52:35.060
Chaitanya and made a big sound there; and
"Shankha Chakra Gadaa Padma". Shankha, Chakra

00:52:35.060 --> 00:52:43.590
Gadaa, Padma are the weapons (of Vishnu) as
you know. All of them He took and came on

00:52:43.590 --> 00:52:50.390
His Garuda to save the chastity of His sister
- immediately, spontaneously, that moment.

00:52:50.390 --> 00:53:00.170
He could have said, "Alright let it be, let
one sari come out then I'll go later."

00:53:00.170 --> 00:53:08.230
I'm sure He must have stolen My saris which
you give for My Pujas, which are too many!

00:53:08.230 --> 00:53:16.540
That's what I feel, that, from where did He
get all these saris to give to Her? Must be

00:53:16.540 --> 00:53:22.470
from My own storage I'm sure, and that's why
you are giving Me so many saris, so that He

00:53:22.470 --> 00:53:34.970
can save the chastity of many women. All this
is so related, so connected, so one, so united.

00:53:34.970 --> 00:53:41.840
There's such a big drama going on but you
can't see it.

00:53:41.840 --> 00:53:53.100
But if you believe in yourself and if you
really believe that you are a Sahaja Yogi,

00:53:53.100 --> 00:54:07.050
that: what are your qualities, what you are,
what's your value is, then I'm sure you can

00:54:07.050 --> 00:54:13.950
become masters. But first of all we have no
value of our realization. We do not know what

00:54:13.950 --> 00:54:19.610
we are capable of, what we can do. You still
think, "oh, I was such an ordinary person,

00:54:19.610 --> 00:54:27.610
Mother has given me realization. I have never
been to university." Nobody has been to university.

00:54:27.610 --> 00:54:35.230
I mean, if you see, Rama never went to any
university, Krishna never went into university,

00:54:35.230 --> 00:54:41.960
Christ never went to any university - an ordinary
man, a son of a carpenter.

00:54:41.960 --> 00:54:47.490
But you are realized souls but you don't realize
your worth and value. Once you realize it,

00:54:47.490 --> 00:54:53.340
you will just smile at everything. Because
you don't know you are sitting on top of the

00:54:53.340 --> 00:54:59.150
world. Once you know that - only then your
mastery will work. Otherwise imagine a master

00:54:59.150 --> 00:55:07.640
sitting under the foot of a disciple, what
will it look like? But it's not that you dominate

00:55:07.640 --> 00:55:19.670
but you are in charge, absolutely in charge.
You know everything, you know how to handle,

00:55:19.670 --> 00:55:23.730
you know how to manage. This is the mastery
you have to get. This is possible, absolutely

00:55:23.730 --> 00:55:28.270
possible, for all of you to do it. But the
first and foremost thing you have to know

00:55:28.270 --> 00:55:31.820
is that we have to master ourselves.

00:55:31.820 --> 00:55:45.090
But then immediately people say "Mother it's
the most difficult to master yourself." I

00:55:45.090 --> 00:55:48.760
can't understand this. Why not? You try to
master everyone, why can't you master yourself?

00:55:48.760 --> 00:55:59.810
Yourself is with you, you are with yourself,
it's your own, it's your own property. You

00:55:59.810 --> 00:56:05.820
can correct the property of others, why can't
you correct your own property? It should be

00:56:05.820 --> 00:56:11.300
the easiest thing to do but you're not sure
that this is your own, you do not know that

00:56:11.300 --> 00:56:19.880
you are capable, but you are and now you have
Self-knowledge, so why should you not do it?

00:56:19.880 --> 00:56:25.540
Why should you not try to watch yourself and
see for yourself? And then you will know that

00:56:25.540 --> 00:56:35.470
you know all the tricks, the yukti. I don't
have to tell you "do this, do that," nothing!

00:56:35.470 --> 00:56:38.970
You yourself will know "ha, come along!"

00:56:38.970 --> 00:56:45.640
We know so many things, little little things,
about ordinary material things: something's

00:56:45.640 --> 00:56:54.520
falling? Alright - put some support to it.
This is happening? Put it that way. But in

00:56:54.520 --> 00:57:05.570
spiritual life it's the easiest thing because
you are in the ocean of knowledge. But if

00:57:05.570 --> 00:57:11.540
you do not know that you are, in the ocean
of knowledge, you will not know the tricks,

00:57:11.540 --> 00:57:17.510
of dealing with others. Because the main purpose
of our communication is to emancipate the

00:57:17.510 --> 00:57:23.660
whole world, to emancipate them. To bring
them out of their ignorance.

00:57:23.660 --> 00:57:32.730
So for that we have to develop this mastery
and not to get lost into nonsensical things

00:57:32.730 --> 00:57:39.280
but this mastery has to be developed. For
that, meditation early in the morning is required

00:57:39.280 --> 00:57:48.810
- to begin with. And then facing yourself
all the time, "Why did I say such a thing?"

00:57:48.810 --> 00:57:57.510
"Aahhhh must be this. This is the word I picked
up from that person." So when you start facing

00:57:57.510 --> 00:58:05.200
yourself, you will be surprised that you are
trying to avoid the reality and just using

00:58:05.200 --> 00:58:15.690
your mind. See there, as I say, that this
mind cheats you and tells you, "all right,

00:58:15.690 --> 00:58:17.710
forget it".

00:58:17.710 --> 00:58:30.580
And the last, but not the least, is that Shri
Krishna is the one who is an expert of drama.

00:58:30.580 --> 00:58:42.010
He creates drama, He acts in the drama, and
He's the spectator also. In these three forms

00:58:42.010 --> 00:58:50.960
you should see yourself. You create the drama
of yourself, "aha this one now, see now, how

00:58:50.960 --> 00:59:00.810
I'm acting here!" Then you become the spectator
also. Become the spectator of your own dramas,

00:59:00.810 --> 00:59:09.780
then you will realize what you are doing,
how you are working out everything. Then the

00:59:09.780 --> 00:59:18.560
deception that we have, all the time, against
ourselves, will just run away. Because if

00:59:18.560 --> 00:59:25.790
an artist knows he's the spectator, if the
one who is acting knows he is the spectator,

00:59:25.790 --> 00:59:35.619
he can never deceive himself, because He knows
this is acting. So this self-deception is

00:59:35.619 --> 00:59:37.320
the one [that] one should try to avoid - "let
me face it."

00:59:37.320 --> 00:59:38.570
But also there is another way out, people
find out. I mean, there are ways and ways.

00:59:38.570 --> 00:59:47.890
Like you tell somebody, "why didn't you write
a letter?" "I know!" 'I know' means what?

00:59:47.890 --> 00:59:57.760
"But don't you think you should have written
a letter to that person, who has done so much

00:59:57.760 --> 01:00:04.390
for you?" "I know." "But don't you think it's
very bad and cruel on your part not to have

01:00:04.390 --> 01:00:12.380
written the letter?" "I know." 'I know' means
what? "I know I'm bad. I know I have been

01:00:12.380 --> 01:00:19.740
stupid. I know I should not have done it.
But I know also that." So what next? Because

01:00:19.740 --> 01:00:25.140
they think that if they have confessed that
"I know," [it's] finished!

01:00:25.140 --> 01:00:31.040
So this is a new escape which was not [there]
at the time of Shri Krishna, it's a new modern

01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:37.660
one, where people say "I know, alright so
what?" "Ohhh alright I'm a sinner so what?"

01:00:37.660 --> 01:00:44.270
This is the second side of it. First of all
"I know that I'm a sinner" and second is a

01:00:44.270 --> 01:00:48.760
higher state is that: "so what, what's wrong?"

01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:57.140
So this is how the derailment starts and one
goes from one to another. If I know something

01:00:57.140 --> 01:01:07.720
then why shouldn't I correct myself? That's
what it should be. "I know I'm like that I

01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:15.000
know it." If you know then you should also
know the trick - how to get rid of it. Because

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:22.560
you are detached from that personality about
which you know, you can correct yourself.

01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:29.880
This is what yoga is, where all your attention
is one with the Divine and you are so detached

01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:42.590
that you can see it. The attachment to all
the things are finished and now the force

01:01:42.590 --> 01:01:50.290
that is coming to you is acting through you
and acting on these attachments also.

01:01:50.290 --> 01:01:59.369
The situation changes, absolutely, in Sahaja
Yoga in a very different way, and if there

01:01:59.369 --> 01:02:05.160
is one bad Sahaja Yogi who comes in, either
he's thrown out or he has to be alright. It's

01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:11.170
the other way around. Anyone who is a bad
Sahaja Yogi, if he comes in Sahaja Yoga, then

01:02:11.170 --> 01:02:14.369
he has to be corrected, otherwise thrown out.

01:02:14.369 --> 01:02:21.780
It is a I think a more evolved state now than
it was at the time of Shri Krishna, because

01:02:21.780 --> 01:02:31.760
He talked only to one - Arjuna. Now I'm talking
to thousands - this knowledge. That time He

01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:38.109
just talked about it at the time of war. I'm
talking at the time of peace. And it's much

01:02:38.109 --> 01:02:41.859
more evolved because Shri Krishna didn't give
him realization. But you have got the realization,

01:02:41.859 --> 01:02:50.400
you've got the knowledge, you know everything.
You have all the subtle ideas.

01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:56.790
So this is what it is today, as it is, the
situation, that: you have become part and

01:02:56.790 --> 01:03:01.990
parcel of Virata already. You have not seen
the Virata (as Arjuna did), but you are part

01:03:01.990 --> 01:03:12.140
and parcel of it. You are not watching it,
you are inside it. So that anymore of not

01:03:12.140 --> 01:03:17.859
watching yourself, only thing will be that,
you'll be thrown out of Sahaja Yoga. Or else

01:03:17.859 --> 01:03:26.790
you better watch yourself and correct yourself
and be one with the body of the Virata.

01:03:26.790 --> 01:03:38.859
This is the sign of a Yogeshwara, and that's
how you have to be, in a mood which is very

01:03:38.859 --> 01:03:47.640
smiling, knowing everything and not sarcastic,
but [with a] very paternal smile, very loving,

01:03:47.640 --> 01:03:54.130
affectionate smile, that you should have for
all the other people and immediately they'll

01:03:54.130 --> 01:04:00.520
recognize. I have seen small children are
like that. They are extremely patronising

01:04:00.520 --> 01:04:02.200
sometimes, you know. They see their parents
and

01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:08.640
this and that. So they come and tell you that,
"don't worry everything will be all right,

01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:17.440
after all God is there to look after you."
And they can be extremely, extremely loving

01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:18.740
and kind and

01:04:18.740 --> 01:04:21.420
the way they talk they will neutralize the
whole thing.

01:04:21.420 --> 01:04:23.400
So we have to learn a lot

01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:27.600
from our children, from all the little babies
that we have

01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:36.080
and 
that we ourselves should have that Ganesha
principal within us, with innocence we should

01:04:36.140 --> 01:04:42.640
work it out. Innocence is the most intelligent
thing and most effective thing. So I would

01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:49.600
request you, all of you, to face yourself
and don't hate yourself but correct yourself,

01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:53.940
respect yourself and try to evolve your own
glory.

01:04:53.940 --> 01:04:57.600
May God bless you.
