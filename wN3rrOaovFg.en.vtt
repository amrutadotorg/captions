No, Shri Mataji, this is just - no, only flowers.

00:06:37.586 --> 00:06:39.145
It's not a fountain.

00:06:39.145 --> 00:06:40.873
But we can make it work.

We spent many money but now the house for the children is very beautiful.

00:10:38.836 --> 00:10:44.936
Perfect, perfect. Not to use it would be a crime.

00:10:44.936 --> 00:10:48.521
[In Hindi]

00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:53.459
Anyway teacher, she wants the school
to come.

00:10:53.459 --> 00:10:57.535
No, no, the important is to start it then we can manage it.

00:10:57.665 --> 00:11:06.492
What we can do is to have one Italian there.

00:11:06.492 --> 00:11:11.957
But I want to start English here

00:11:11.957 --> 00:11:14.800
to prepare them to go to other school.

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:16.385
To go to Daglio?

00:11:19.344 --> 00:11:22.801
This here is, these are the toilettes for the girls.

00:11:22.801 --> 00:11:24.000

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.062
Ah, so you have two sets.

00:11:25.062 --> 00:11:25.652
Yes.

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:28.902
[In Hindi]

00:11:29.532 --> 00:11:31.298
This is the regulation of the school.

00:11:31.298 --> 00:11:33.298
Yes, you're with it.

00:11:33.298 --> 00:11:37.978
[Inaudible] for children. All these chairs and all that,

00:11:37.978 --> 00:11:43.154
for small, for small, chairs and all.

00:11:43.154 --> 00:11:45.693
We will buy small chairs and tables.

00:11:45.693 --> 00:11:48.281
So, how many tables and small chairs you should buy now.

00:11:48.281 --> 00:11:49.519
Yes, Shri Mataji, I'll tell them.

00:11:49.519 --> 00:11:52.415
And how many tables.

00:11:52.415 --> 00:11:55.307
Yes. Yes, Shri Mataji.

00:11:55.307 --> 00:11:57.537
Because they'll be small.

00:11:57.537 --> 00:12:02.395
Up to five years, they'll come [short name for Sadhana]?

00:12:02.395 --> 00:12:04.934
Five years, six, seven.

00:12:04.934 --> 00:12:06.694
Six to eleven.

00:12:06.694 --> 00:12:12.545
That's why. So, we can get other chairs.

00:12:12.545 --> 00:12:16.662
O, I just purchase this, that's all.

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:25.316
Our desire is to fulfil your, your desires and your will.

00:12:27.993 --> 00:12:37.378
This was my old idea to bring them to England because tthey want to learn English.

00:12:37.378 --> 00:12:41.675
And now we'll go and see the other big school library.

00:12:41.675 --> 00:12:46.479
See, you can make another bedroom here.

00:12:46.479 --> 00:12:49.349
So that two and two four.

00:12:49.349 --> 00:12:51.906
[In Hindi]

00:12:51.906 --> 00:12:57.615
That time I use to walk when I saw this.

00:13:02.397 --> 00:13:08.802
Amazing. Amazing. Amazing is the word. Amazing.

00:13:08.802 --> 00:13:11.687
We are so lucky, Shri Mataji, to have you as our Mother.

00:13:11.687 --> 00:13:14.564
You look after us so well. We are so lucky.

00:13:16.279 --> 00:13:22.729
But I, I didn’t understand that, "Why people didn't buy this?"

00:13:22.729 --> 00:13:29.183
I couldn’t understand. Because it is an institution, I think.

00:13:31.652 --> 00:13:33.897
I think the house was waiting for you.

00:13:33.897 --> 00:13:35.897
[Laughter] it must be.

00:13:36.521 --> 00:13:40.019
No, I just asked, so I bought it.

00:13:40.019 --> 00:13:43.552
No, in any case, you can put bars there.

00:13:43.552 --> 00:13:44.591
Yes.

00:13:47.632 --> 00:13:50.431
First, the decor, this is so beautiful.

00:13:50.431 --> 00:13:50.931
Yes.

00:13:50.931 --> 00:13:53.091
This is made in this country?

00:13:53.091 --> 00:13:53.787
Yes, Shri Mataji.

00:13:53.787 --> 00:13:54.466
Really good.

00:13:54.466 --> 00:13:56.903
They make beautiful things.

00:13:56.903 --> 00:14:01.784
Marvellous place, beautiful style.

00:14:02.928 --> 00:14:04.658
[In Hindi, let's go]
