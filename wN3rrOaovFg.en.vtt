We spent many money but now the house for the children is very beautiful.

10:38.836 --> 10:44.936
Perfect, perfect. Not to use it would be a crime.

10:44.936 --> 10:48.521
[In Hindi]

10:48.990 --> 10:53.459
Anyway teacher, she wants the school
to come.

10:53.459 --> 10:57.535
No, no, the important is to start it then we can manage it.

10:57.665 --> 11:06.492
What we can do is to have one Italian there.

11:06.492 --> 11:11.957
But I want to start English here

11:11.957 --> 11:14.800
to prepare them to go to other school.

11:14.800 --> 11:16.385
To go to Daglio?

11:19.344 --> 11:22.801
This here is, these are the toilettes for the girls.

11:22.801 --> 11:24.000
This is for boys.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.062
Ah, so you have two sets.

11:25.062 --> 11:25.652
Yes.

11:26.200 --> 11:28.902
[In Hindi]

11:29.532 --> 11:31.298
This is the regulation of the school.

11:31.298 --> 11:33.298
Yes, you're with it.

11:33.298 --> 11:37.978
[Inaudible] for children. All these chairs and all that,

11:37.978 --> 11:43.154
for small, for small, chairs and all.

11:43.154 --> 11:45.693
We will buy small chairs and tables.

11:45.693 --> 11:48.281
So, how many tables and small chairs you should buy now.

11:48.281 --> 11:49.519
Yes, Shri Mataji, I'll tell them.

11:49.519 --> 11:52.415
And how many tables.

11:52.415 --> 11:55.307
Yes. Yes, Shri Mataji.

11:55.307 --> 11:57.537
Because they'll be small.

11:57.537 --> 12:02.395
Up to five years, they'll come [short name for Sadhana]?

12:02.395 --> 12:04.934
Five years, six, seven.

12:04.934 --> 12:06.694
Six to eleven.

12:06.694 --> 12:12.545
That's why. So, we can get other chairs.

12:12.545 --> 12:16.662
O, I just purchase this, that's all.

12:17.260 --> 12:25.316
Our desire is to fulfil your, your desires and your will.

12:27.993 --> 12:37.378
This was my old idea to bring them to England because tthey want to learn English.

12:37.378 --> 12:41.675
And now we'll go and see the other big school library.

12:41.675 --> 12:46.479
See, you can make another bedroom here.

12:46.479 --> 12:49.349
So that two and two four.

12:49.349 --> 12:51.906

13:02.397 --> 13:08.802
Amazing. Amazing. Amazing is the word. Amazing.

13:08.802 --> 13:11.687
We are so lucky, Shri Mataji, to have you as our Mother.

13:11.687 --> 13:14.564
You look after us so well. We are so lucky.

13:16.279 --> 13:22.729
But I, I didn’t understand that, "Why people didn't buy this?"

13:22.729 --> 13:29.183
I couldn’t understand. Because it is an institution, I think.

13:31.652 --> 13:33.897
I think the house was waiting for you.

13:33.897 --> 13:35.897
[Laughter] it must be.

13:36.521 --> 13:40.019
No, I just asked, so I bought it.

13:40.019 --> 13:43.552
No, in any case, you can put bars there.

13:43.552 --> 13:44.591
Yes.

13:47.632 --> 13:50.431
First, the decor, this is so beautiful.

13:50.431 --> 13:50.931
Yes.

13:50.931 --> 13:53.091
This is made in this country?

13:53.091 --> 13:53.787
Yes, Shri Mataji.

13:53.787 --> 13:54.466
Really good.

13:54.466 --> 13:56.903
