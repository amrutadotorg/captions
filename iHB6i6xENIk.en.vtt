00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.875
The peace has to be within, to begin with.

00:00:14.955 --> 00:00:18.654
You have to be peaceful within yourself.

00:00:19.067 --> 00:00:25.422
If you are not peaceful, if you are 
playing tricks with your ego,

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:32.750
if you are just satisfying yourself saying

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:36.608
that you are peaceful, you are sadly mistaken.

00:00:37.015 --> 00:00:41.342
Peace is to be enjoyed within yourself.

00:00:43.895 --> 00:00:46.582
It is to be felt within yourself.

00:00:46.662 --> 00:00:53.032
So do not give wrong satisfactions to yourself.

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:58.836
Do not give false notions to yourself. 
Don’t cheat yourself.

00:01:00.808 --> 00:01:05.942
Peace has to be felt within yourself, 
and if you are not feeling that,

00:01:06.201 --> 00:01:09.332
you shouldn’t come and ask me, 
“Mother, why I am not feeling it.”

00:01:09.418 --> 00:01:13.662
Because I am not going to tell you 
that something [is] wrong with you.

00:01:15.068 --> 00:01:21.582
You have to work it out that 
you should feel peaceful within yourself.

00:01:23.601 --> 00:01:31.857
It is not that if you have too much 
of silence outside, you feel peaceful.

00:01:32.185 --> 00:01:35.312
The peace has to be within yourself.

00:01:36.875 --> 00:01:40.913
You have it. Your Spirit is absolutely peaceful

00:01:40.994 --> 00:01:44.621
Avyagra, without restlessness.

00:01:44.827 --> 00:01:47.588
There is no restlessness in your Spirit.

00:01:47.864 --> 00:01:50.982
Absolutely peaceful and steady.

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.061
It is for you to feel it.

00:01:55.204 --> 00:01:59.019
It is not for anybody else to certify you. 
This is one thing.

00:01:59.392 --> 00:02:02.964
Secondly, when I am telling you something, 
you think I am not telling you.

00:02:03.051 --> 00:02:04.913
It doesn’t register in your brain.

00:02:04.993 --> 00:02:09.742
You think I am telling it to X, Y, Z 
but not to you. You are not in it.

00:02:10.028 --> 00:02:12.681
That’s another sign [that] there is no peace.

00:02:12.761 --> 00:02:16.382
Because there is no peace, 
there is no registration.

00:02:16.862 --> 00:02:22.937
Whatever goes into your head, that is going to work out.

00:02:23.139 --> 00:02:32.685
But what I find [is] that people [who] have
 concave personalities, then they receive it.

00:02:32.765 --> 00:02:39.435
Those who have convex personalities, 
do not register anything .

00:02:39.614 --> 00:02:45.804
The registration is so poor that, whatever 
I say doesn’t have any effect on them.

00:02:45.884 --> 00:02:48.127
Otherwise, whatever I say is a mantra.

00:02:48.212 --> 00:02:53.983
It should have direct effect on you, 
nd you should feel that effect,

00:02:54.063 --> 00:02:57.062
that penetration within you.

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:03.782
But as if it is for somebody else, 
as if it is not for you.

00:03:10.841 --> 00:03:13.942
This shows there is no peace within you.

00:03:16.078 --> 00:03:25.869
Only the peace within can register 
whatever is auspicious,

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:30.062
whatever is nourishing for your growth.

00:03:31.283 --> 00:03:34.196
So try to make peace with yourself.

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.808
Do not fight with yourself.

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:41.048
“Why should I do it?”, “I am so bad!”, 
“I should not have done it!”

00:03:41.128 --> 00:03:43.862
All these we should not do.

00:03:44.751 --> 00:03:48.581
Try not to fight with yourself, first of all.

00:03:48.662 --> 00:03:51.037
Then you fight with me, 
“Why am I like this?

00:03:51.117 --> 00:03:54.782
Why should it be like this with me? 
Why is it I catch? Why. . .?

00:03:54.862 --> 00:03:57.607
How am I to answer such a question? 
It is very aggressive.

00:03:57.666 --> 00:04:00.095
I think it is very aggressive attitude

00:04:00.175 --> 00:04:03.207
of many Sahaja Yogis to come 
and ask me such a question, “Why…?”

00:04:03.287 --> 00:04:08.222
Because I can’t tell you what is wrong 
with you because it is not in my culture.

00:04:10.671 --> 00:04:14.070
You should find yourself 
what is wrong with you .

00:04:15.175 --> 00:04:18.050
But it’s not “what’s wrong with you” 
is the problem.

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.622
What is right with you is the attitude.

00:04:22.973 --> 00:04:29.502
Whatever is right with you, put your foot 
on that, establish yourself on that point.

00:04:29.582 --> 00:04:31.924
And then develop yourself higher.
