1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:05,480
Sahaja Yogini: … which is the point of evolution

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:06,720
for all of us.

3
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:11,720
And it gives great pleasure to Sahaja Yogis

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,240
to see so many other people

5
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,320
coming along to get their realization.

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:22,520
Because the experience, once you achieve it,

7
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,600
makes you collectively conscious and puts you in touch,

8
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,240
in a very real way, with the vibrations of other people

9
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,920
and with your own vibrations, of course

10
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:39,120
so that you're able to feel the exact condition of your subtle body,

11
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:43,840
and your spirit, and your chakras, which are these.

12
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:48,360
these coloured circles here represent

13
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:52,680
the subtle transformers of energy that are placed within us

14
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:56,720
along the sympathetic nervous system.

15
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:02,800
And in the centre there,

16
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:07,240
between the yellow and blue lines,

17
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:11,520
is the area in which the Kundalini energy rises

18
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:15,480
when it's awakened by the presence of another being

19
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,080
who already has that awakened within him

20
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,440
and is emitting the vibrations

21
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:27,520
that are the same as the universal Kundalini energy.

22
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,760
Kundalini in Christian terms is called the Holy Spirit,

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,760
and it's the same energy that's described

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,760
in the New Testament as the “cool wind”.

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,680
In Indian scriptures it's described as the Chaitanya,

26
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:52,280
as cool vibrations, and in Muslim scriptures it is called the Ruh,

27
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:55,680
and also described as cool vibrations.

28
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,720
And these cool vibrations that you feel once

29
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,560
you receive the awakening

30
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:08,640
are the vibrations of absolute truth.

31
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:13,720
Once you develop this awareness,

32
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,000
you're able to ask any absolute question,

33
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,760
and, by holding your hands out, you can ask

34
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,520
if you're an atheist, you can ask the existence of God.

35
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:31,000
And whether you get a cool or a warm vibration,

36
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:37,080
you can tell whether what you're asking about is true or not true.

37
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,320
So there's no need to use the intellect anymore

38
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,920
to try and work out things,

39
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,880
because that's a limited sphere of activity;

40
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,560
but you actually, once you get your realization,

41
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,760
you go beyond mere thinking

42
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,840
into the unlimited, into the divine area.

43
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:04,840
I think …

44
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:10,440
it's a relief to be with people who are seeking their spirit,

45
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,560
who do have a desire to know the Divine

46
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:20,000
and to understand those …

47
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:26,000
things that in this society have almost become taboo subjects,

48
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:31,640
that there's so much emphasis around us, in our upbringing,

49
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:37,680
on material success, and competition, and …

50
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,880
doing better than everybody else in achieving things,

51
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:46,160
that the subtle things, that are much more important,

52
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,040
get pushed completely into the background.

53
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:53,760
And sometimes we feel as if we are quite out of step with

54
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,560
everything, because we know that this is uneasy feeling

55
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,240
that there's something wrong with the world at the moment

56
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,160
but we can't put it right ourselves,

57
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:08,240
and it can be quite distressing.

58
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,480
In my experience, once I actually

59
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,760
received my realization from Mother, two years ago in Melbourne

60
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,760
at a programme like this,

61
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,440
I couldn't believe it that it had actually …

62
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,400
that I had found what I was looking for,

63
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,680
without even quite knowing what it was that I was looking for.

64
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,920
And …it's because

65
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,720
at first you try and understand you with your intellect,

66
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:40,320
and it doesn't seem to even make sense that …

67
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,080
and a lot of people, actually,

68
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,840
their self-esteem has been so damaged by their seeking,

69
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:52,000
that it's hard to believe that you yourself could have

70
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:58,640
this quality within you, just waiting to be awakened.

71
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,440
So, perhaps, before Mataji arrives,

72
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:10,240
it would be good if you could just sit quietly and …

73
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,200
don't try and do anything.

74
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,760
If you've been in the habit of doing

75
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,280
particular types of meditation or techniques,

76
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:24,600
just try and put them aside and just have a completely open mind

77
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,240
about this experience because it is different,

78
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,680
although the terms may be familiar to you

79
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:34,840
from readings and teachings that you've had.

80
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:38,400
It's best to sort of try and approach it like a child,

81
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,120
with complete openness and freshness.

82
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,000
There's nothing frightening about the experience,

83
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,240
because it is, in fact,

84
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,920
a gift of God to us.

85
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:55,320
And God is Compassion and Love.

86
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,600
And the vibrations that you feel once your Kundalini is awakened

87
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:03,760
are those vibrations that come from that Being.

88
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,720
And there is nothing to be afraid of, although some books do say

89
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:12,840
that Kundalini awakening can be dangerous and so on.

90
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,560
The people who've written those have experienced

91
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:18,680
something quite different.

92
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:24,000
But the actual experience should give you peace and joy,

93
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,080
which is absolute.

94
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:30,920
So, if you can just try and just be at peace now,

95
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,120
and quiet, and in your receptive frame of mind,

96
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:39,400
and enjoy the experience when Mother comes.

97
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,720
Thank you.

98
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,880
Sahaja Yogi: Again, ladies and gentlemen,

99
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,920
it gives me a great pleasure, especially to the …

100
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:12,640
Shri Mataji: Thank you very much.

101
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,000
SY: … especially to the people who have come for the first time.

102
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,760
There are many who couldn't come

103
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,800
either last evening or today to the workshop.

104
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,720
To all of you, welcome.

105
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:34,800
Shri Mataji is here, for the first time in Perth, to

106
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,560
to grant Self-realization,

107
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:41,680
not just on a one-to-one basis but to as many people

108
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,720
as desired from their heart.

109
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,720
Many got it last night.

110
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:52,400
Some came to the workshop today and experienced something more.

111
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,240
All of you have to get it because this is the time

112
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,560
when the grace of God is overflowing, and …

113
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:05,480
all of the true seekers of ages have to get their Self-realization.

114
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,000
It's the reward of their seeking, it's the blessing

115
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,280
of their past births

116
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:16,280
and all the seeking of God over the ages.

117
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,800
We've all probably been a Christian, we've all been a Jew,

118
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,800
we've all been a Muslim.

119
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,440
We've been worshippers

120
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:29,080
of God the Father and God the Mother

121
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,040
at many many times in history.

122
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,480
And so, now the time has come when we can get

123
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,320
that final step in our evolution,

124
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:44,120
which is just to be triggered by an enlightened being

125
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,760
and which, once you get it,

126
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,280
you can develop to that point

127
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,360
where you become totally one with God.

128
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,160
This is the real yoga.

129
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,120
Yoga, as you know, means union, oneness with God.

130
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:03,440
It's not exercises, it's not some discipline.

131
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:08,080
It's the actualization of Self-realization.

132
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:11,840
And so, without any further introduction by me,

133
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,840
it gives me again great pleasure, ladies and gentlemen,

134
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:20,920
to introduce to you Her Holiness Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi.

135
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:48,680
Shri Mataji: To all the seekers of truth and joy I bow.

136
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,400
It was really nice this morning

137
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,000
to meet some earnest seekers come down

138
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,000
to the place where I live

139
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:07,360
and to get their ultimate what they are seeking.

140
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:14,600
We have to know that God has created us with a purpose.

141
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:19,800
He has worked for so many years,

142
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:25,920
He has made us human beings with such care and love.

143
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,120
There has to be a purpose behind it.

144
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:33,160
We also know that we have not yet found our purpose,

145
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,840
and that's why we are seeking.

146
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,600
If we understand that,

147
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:46,120
then one must know that something has to happen.

148
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,840
God has to save His creation.

149
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:54,040
And His greatest creation is a human being.

150
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,680
This is what He has done out of all the creation —

151
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,720
that you tried to evolve,

152
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:05,080
and that's how human beings are created.

153
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:09,000
Only thing was, a human being was given a freedom

154
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,600
to choose between the right and the wrong for life.

155
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:18,920
It so happened that human being, in their error, naiveness —

156
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,800
I should say, in ignorance ,

157
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,760
did lots of mistakes. Doesn't matter.

158
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,880
Even if they have done,

159
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,320
most of them have come to right conclusion;

160
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,000
and that right conclusion,

161
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,200
as I told you yesterday, sums up like this:

162
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:41,440
that whatever is going to happen to us further than this,

163
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:46,000
it has to be spontaneous, is a living process

164
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,760
that has made us human being, nothing dead.

165
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,920
If the living process has to work it out,

166
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,400
then it has to be spontaneous.

167
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,520
We cannot work it out.

168
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:02,600
Secondly, that you cannot pay for it, or you cannot manoeuvre it.

169
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,720
And thirdly, that you cannot put in any effort,

170
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,480
it has to be effortless.

171
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:13,240
If it is the most vital thing for God, it has to be effortless.

172
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,440
So that's how we reach certain conclusions:

173
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:23,080
that Self-realization, if it is the epitome of our evolution,

174
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:28,400
it has to be absolutely freely given

175
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:33,640
and has to happen in a very spontaneous way.

176
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,280
Yesterday I explained to you in short

177
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:41,160
all the various types of ideas people have about Self-realization,

178
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:46,640
and what we have to expect about Self-realization.

179
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,760
We had another enquiry this morning about Kundalini,

180
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,240
that a gentleman asked Me a question saying

181
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:59,760
that he has read some books which are all the time warning

182
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,160
that Kundalini business is very difficult,

183
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:05,200
it comes up to a point but not

184
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,760
beyond a point, and all sorts of stories.

185
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,160
And I have to tell you that that's not true.

186
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,120
Kundalini is your own mother.

187
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,920
You have your individual mother.

188
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,720
And she is waiting all the time, all these years,

189
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,800
just to give you your second birth.

190
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,080
She never harms you, she never troubles you,

191
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,560
she doesn't do anything of that kind.

192
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:37,720
It's … I don't know, the people who do not know how to do the thing

193
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:42,160
or who have no authority must be doing all these kinds of tricks

194
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:47,000
and must be suffering from Kundalini awakening.

195
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,760
I know of one gentleman

196
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,680
who, in Kashmir, said that he's got Kundalini awakening

197
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,760
and he had tremendous heat and tremendous burning

198
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,920
and all sorts of things, and that …

199
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,760
he … “it's a very dangerous thing”, he has written a book on that,

200
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,880
some sort of a … I'm forgetting the name of the book.

201
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:14,360
Now, this gentleman himself is leading a very horrible life.

202
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,680
Of that I've been able to find out.

203
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,920
He has all sorts of relations, and he's leading

204
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:25,080
a very ridiculous life, not suitable for any saint.

205
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:28,840
If such a man has to have a Kundalini awakening …

206
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,760
I can't understand how can Kundalini come to him,

207
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,600
but must be some sort of a God's anger on him

208
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:41,080
that he has felt this kind of a feeling within him, maybe,

209
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:44,880
or maybe he has been to somebody who is a wrong type of a person,

210
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:50,480
who has awakened the Kundalini

211
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,120
without any authority.

212
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:56,520
And maybe, that time, the first deity, as I told you

213
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,840
is it there? the chart is not there?

214
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:02,040
the first deity I told you

215
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:08,080
did not like it and got angry.

216
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:11,240
And the whole sympathetic nervous system on the left-hand side

217
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,440
and right-hand side got angry.

218
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:18,400
And when that happen, the person can develop lot of heat

219
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:21,600
and lot of blisters.

220
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,240
I have seen a person getting a blister all over,

221
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:27,360
all round his neck.

222
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,440
At the very outset I must tell you

223
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:35,560
that heat is the sign of

224
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:41,440
violent action.

225
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,760
Say, for example, if you heat the helium gas,

226
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,760
the molecules of the helium gas start going all round.

227
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,920
They are very volatile, they start moving in a way

228
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:59,040
that you feel that two armies are fighting.

229
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,400
Then you find that ten armies are fighting,

230
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,000
then you find all of them are fighting with each other.

231
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:07,760
But if you cool it down, their action is very collective;

232
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,640
they move in a smooth manner, in a very collective manner.

233
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:16,040
So, one can see that when we are heated up also ,

234
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,360
you see, a man is very hot-tempered

235
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:24,760
means he is a very … angry person,

236
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,680
and he cannot carry on with others, he has no patience.

237
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:32,320
But when we see that a person is cool, is collected,

238
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,560
then we say he is a nice person.

239
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:39,760
In the same way, if you feel heat from your Kundalini,

240
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,120
then be sure that something is wrong that is resisting you.

241
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,760
Even while giving realization in the beginning,

242
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,600
you do feel little heat because the heat of the body has to go out.

243
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:53,280
But today I'm going to tell you more about,

244
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,280
particularly more about the chakras

245
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,320
and not about the general things that I told you last time.

246
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,320
In any case, you can get the book,

247
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:06,280
and you can come to our centres and clarify it more and more.

248
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,320
But, as much as possible, today I will try

249
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,320
to tell you about the chakras,

250
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:15,760
how we spoil them,

251
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,760
and what are the effects of these subtle chakras,

252
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:24,840
which look after our gross plexuses within our body.

253
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,120
Please be seated.

254
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,080
Now, the first chakra, as I told you,

255
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,240
is called as the Mooladhara Chakra.

256
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:40,480
I'm sorry.

257
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,680
(Aside) Is it all right now? Can you see it?

258
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,120
Sahaja Yogi: Just raise it slightly [unclear].

259
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:48,440
Shri Mataji: You can't hear? All right.

260
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:52,680
Now, this is the first centre, which is a subtle centre within us.

261
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:57,640
Now, this centre is manifesting outside

262
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,080
what you call the pelvic plexus.

263
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:06,520
The pelvic plexus is responsible for all our excretions.

264
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:10,920
Whether you like it or not, it is there, it is present within us,

265
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:17,040
and it looks after all our excretory …

266
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,880
functions.

267
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:26,600
It is important to see

268
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:30,400
that this chakra is placed under the Kundalini.

269
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,760
So, when the Kundalini rises …

270
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,600
the Kundalini is the power within you,

271
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:42,440
the pure power of desire,

272
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:47,200
the desire that you want to become one with the Divine.

273
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,600
Now, it lies below,

274
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:54,520
this chakra lies below, is a very important point —

275
00:18:54,720 --> 00:19:00,280
that this chakra does not play any part

276
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,720
in the ascent of the Kundalini,

277
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:06,480
because Kundalini doesn't pierce through it.

278
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,160
On the contrary, if this chakra is pure,

279
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:15,360
the information about somebody who can raise your Kundalini

280
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,760
can be easily communicated through this chakra.

281
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,200
But it does not

282
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,600
play any part in our evolution.

283
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:32,320
That means sex does not play part in our evolution.

284
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:37,440
Animals know what is sex is, human beings know what sex is.

285
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:41,600
Sex is a part very natural within us,

286
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:46,760
and for our ascent the sex does not play any part.

287
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,360
At the time when the Kundalini is rising …

288
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:55,120
the Kundalini who is the mother of the deity of this centre,

289
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:58,840
this Kundalini is the Virgin,

290
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:03,120
so He is looking after the protocol of the Virgin.

291
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:07,040
And this Kundalini, when She has to rise,

292
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:10,880
if you have by any chance

293
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,280
something wrong with this chakra,

294
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,640
then it takes time for Kundalini to rise.

295
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,160
Because this centre

296
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,320
has to give permission or, you can say, the sanction

297
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:25,880
that it's all right and that Kundalini can rise.

298
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,080
So this is the sustaining force,

299
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:31,760
or is the centre of the Kundalini itself.

300
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,240
Now, the word “mooladhara” means

301
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:39,280
“the one who is the support of

302
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:44,920
the … moola is what? … moola is …

303
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,680
of the root”.

304
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,320
The root is the Kundalini.

305
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:54,120
And it resides in that area, that is called as Mooladhara,

306
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,800
while the centre is down,

307
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:59,160
and the centre is called as Mooladhara Chakra.

308
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,760
That's how we have these two things separate.

309
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,160
Now, this centre is important because it gives sustenance,

310
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:11,000
it looks after the protocol of your Kundalini.

311
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,520
So anybody who says that you can ascend through sex,

312
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,160
please be sure you are misled by that.

313
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,360
I do not want to mislead you.

314
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,920
I want you to have your Self-realization.

315
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:26,800
Because you are people who are seekers ,not today,

316
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,880
you have been seekers for ages.

317
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,520
And no use running after something

318
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:35,360
because it appeals to your weaknesses, or because it supports

319
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,560
some sort of a thing which you heard before, like Freud.

320
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:42,640
Now what Freud has said is absolutely wrong.

321
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:46,360
Because what he has achieved today you can see very clearly

322
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:50,480
that all the societies in the West are finished.

323
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,480
This is thanks to the unholy trinity. One of them was Mr. Freud.

324
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:58,400
And when I said this in Austria, people were very happy.

325
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,760
Because they were feeling guilty that it is Freud

326
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,440
whom they supported always,

327
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,120
and what he has done, he's played a mess with everybody's life.

328
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,320
He just knew one side of life,

329
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:11,920
that one side which starts from the sex, goes upward.

330
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,880
That's only the desire.

331
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:17,760
That's only the desire power, but he did not know the other side.

332
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,760
When he talked that you should not be conditioned at all,

333
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,080
he did not know that if you do not condition yourself,

334
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:27,040
then there is another side which is much more dangerous,

335
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:30,760
and that is the side of ego.

336
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,760
This is what exactly Hitler did.

337
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,840
He used his ego. And with his ego what he has done.

338
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,720
And so many such people,

339
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:44,120
who are thinking there's nothing like conditioning ,

340
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,760
“What's wrong? What's wrong?”  and what they achieved is nothing

341
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,280
but a very bumptious, useless ego, which cannot see the truth.

342
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:56,800
Anybody who pampers that ego, they run after it.

343
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:00,120
And they say, “This is your name,” big name they give you,

344
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,640
or they tell you, “Oh, you just do this,

345
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:06,280
you look like this, you wear this, you do this.”

346
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,760
You get quite satisfied with it. You have to be honest.

347
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,440
If you are not honest to it, how will you get your realization?

348
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,760
You have to be honest. To get your realization

349
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,560
you have to be a human being, first and last.

350
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,720
If you are not a human being, you are just trying

351
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:25,560
to do something which is so outside.

352
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:29,080
It is all outside. If you are doing something outside,

353
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,280
you cannot get it inside. It has to happen inside.

354
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,600
I feel concerned because you people

355
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:40,640
are realized persons if you take to reality.

356
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:43,720
But if you don't take to it, what's going to happen to you?

357
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:47,600
Because you are seekers. You are not like mundane, ordinary people,

358
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:50,320
who are not seeking, who are just seeking money or position

359
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,000
or things. You are special people.

360
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,920
You are people of God, who have to become prophets,

361
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:58,080
and you must have powers to make others prophets,

362
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:01,840
as William Blake has said about hundred years back.

363
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:05,800
You are that type of people. And you should not waste your energy,

364
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,760
believing into things which is not true.

365
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,280
Is not true, because, you see, the Kundalini

366
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:16,000
is placed above that point which we call as sex.

367
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:19,520
We are not sex points! To reduce ourselves to sex points

368
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:23,200
is the minimum, I mean, I'd say, the most degrading thing

369
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,840
that can happen to human beings.

370
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:29,760
We are the highest type of creation of God.

371
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,760
Sex, everybody has, you know even earthworms have,

372
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,040
every sort of nonsense has sex. What's so great about sex?

373
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:41,200
There is so much we talk about sex as if we are impotent people.

374
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:45,240
There is nothing in sex that can give you your realization.

375
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,640
Of course, you have to lead a sanity,

376
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,800
you have to understand a life of sanity

377
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:54,680
and lead a life of understanding about sex.

378
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,920
Sahaja Yoga is never against sex,

379
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,600
we believe in sensible marriages,

380
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:03,560
bringing up children who are very realized souls

381
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:06,920
to be born on this earth. That is the thing we have to achieve.

382
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:10,280
There are so many great people who want to be born.

383
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,640
But the people who are going to give them birth

384
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:17,160
are lost into nonsensical things, they are just lost.

385
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,920
They have no idea as to the whole,

386
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,840
what part, what role they have to play into it,

387
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:27,120
and just they get lost in their individual understanding of a thing.

388
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,320
It is not that.

389
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,880
You have to understand it's a very cosmic thing that's happening,

390
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:35,400
and thousands and thousands and thousands of people

391
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:38,640
have to get their realization. That's the main thing.

392
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:41,640
If you don't get your realization, I must say

393
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:45,760
the age-old desire of yours is lost for ever.

394
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,200
So don't fix your mind into some idea which somebody

395
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:52,560
has screwed into your head because thousands are running after it.

396
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:58,520
Maybe that reality cannot have thousands, maybe.

397
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,800
Millions we can't have, I know that. Reality is not easy to accept.

398
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:05,280
Never people accepted reality so far.

399
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,440
When Christ came in, how they behaved?

400
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:10,760
When Buddha came in, how they behaved? Nobody does that way.

401
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,360
It's a  you see, it's not a hoard that's walking towards it,

402
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,160
it's not a shoals of fishes walking towards it,

403
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,560
it's not a big mob walking towards it.

404
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:23,800
It's every person who has to receive the realization.

405
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,760
And you have to pay full attention to it.

406
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,280
You have to respect yourself, and know that you are a seeker.

407
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:33,360
And, as a seeker, you all must get your realization.

408
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,480
Otherwise you have no meaning, no purpose, nothing.

409
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:39,760
And if you join any purposeless pursuit,

410
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,280
I would say I have told with all earnestness

411
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:46,240
and with all My love, but if you don't want to understand it,

412
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:49,840
nobody can force your realization into you.

413
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:55,360
So please understand that first thing is to get your realization.

414
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,280
If you can't get your realization,

415
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:00,760
then you have lost the biggest chance of your life.

416
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,760
You all have to become your spirit, your Self.

417
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,320
And this is the great instrument God has created within you.

418
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:13,920
As I told you yesterday, this is the knowledge of the roots,

419
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,560
of the roots within us.

420
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,680
And this knowledge you have to understand first of all,

421
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,600
you need not accept it, but you should not deny.

422
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,040
With open mind, listen to Me

423
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:27,160
what happens, and how these chakras are within us,

424
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,280
and how they react, and how we falter.

425
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,640
So one of the first things I have to tell you

426
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:36,200
that sex plays no part in Kundalini ascent

427
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:39,200
as far as its piercing is concerned,

428
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:43,440
means it does not have to pass through that.

429
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,720
Whatever is the truth, I have to tell you.

430
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,640
You may not like it, but I have to tell you.

431
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,600
I am not here to seek votes

432
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,400
or to have elections or to collect money out of you.

433
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:55,440
I don't want to buy Rolls-Royces. Nothing of the kind.

434
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:58,320
I am here to give you what you have, what is your own.

435
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,240
I am just here to give you that,

436
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,680
what is your own, what is your own property.

437
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:07,080
So it does not matter also if you do not like it for the time being.

438
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,600
But ultimately you'll like

439
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,760
because you will know Mother has told us the truth.

440
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,080
Now, the second chakra, Swadhishthana,

441
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,760
is also a very important chakra within us.

442
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,240
This Swadhishthana Chakra

443
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,480
plays a very very important part in our lives,

444
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,600
when in the modern times specially.

445
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:29,080
Because this is the centre we use for planning,

446
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,800
thinking, for all futuristic life,

447
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:35,920
as well as doing every sort of physical work.

448
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:41,560
This centre is the one that creates balances as well as imbalances.

449
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,920
If you use this centre in a wrong way,

450
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:48,760
you create an imbalance within you, of a very very serious nature.

451
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,200
For example, this centre, Swadhishthana,

452
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:55,480
looks after your aortic plexus in the gross.

453
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:58,080
Aortic plexus doctors know what it is.

454
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,400
But this centre is a subtle centre

455
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:06,520
placed in the medulla oblongata inside the spinal cord.

456
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:10,640
Now, with this centre, we think about the future,

457
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,560
or we can think about the past.

458
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:17,520
We put in physical work also through this centre.

459
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,840
So it moves to the right as well as to the left.

460
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:23,480
It is dangling in the air. It's the only centre

461
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:27,400
which moves on both the sides in such a big periphery, all round.

462
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:32,320
And it can also retract and can go further within.

463
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:36,320
Now, when we have an imbalance in this,

464
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:40,280
we really do not realize that we are leading an imbalanced life,

465
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,280
till we get into a serious trouble.

466
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:48,520
This centre has got to look after your liver, your kidney,

467
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:52,680
your spleen, your pancreas,

468
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:55,120
and your uterus.

469
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,520
Plus it has a very important work:

470
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:02,320
that when you think too much, the brains cells are used up —

471
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:06,200
to replace the brain cells from the fat cells from the stomach.

472
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:10,040
It transforms the fat cells for the use of the brain.

473
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:13,080
And this is a very important work it has to do.

474
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:16,320
(Aside) Can you put on this one please? Yes.

475
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:22,040
Now, when this chakra

476
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,520
works more for thinking, for planning, this, that,

477
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:29,520
it is … it neglects its other work,

478
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:33,400
which is also equally important, like liver, and your pancreas,

479
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,560
and your kidneys, your spleen.

480
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:43,440
And thus we develop diseases of liver, of all these organs.

481
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:48,240
Out of this, liver trouble comes to us because of our overactivity;

482
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:53,760
also it can come to us from inactivity of the liver.

483
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,400
It can come to us from both the types of liver.

484
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:02,440
Now, if you have an active liver, a very active liver,

485
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:06,720
you develop a funny disease , we call it as biliousness.

486
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:09,160
Your attention is always unhappy,

487
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,760
and you feel like vomiting all the time.

488
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,840
You you get very irritable, and you have a temperament

489
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:19,760
that you don't feel the peace within yourself.

490
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,200
This is one. That means your attention gets absolutely disturbed.

491
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:29,280
Because the liver is the one that really sustains your attention.

492
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:32,160
So when your liver is out, your attention is funny,

493
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:34,240
you don't know what to do with your attention,

494
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,440
and all the time you feel, “Oh, it's terrible,”

495
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:42,120
and you feel very nervous, and agitated and anxious.

496
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:46,720
But then doctors do not know at that stage, I think,

497
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,120
it's liver, which is bad.

498
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:53,080
So, what they do is to use the …

499
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:57,240
something to find out about liver, what's wrong with the liver.

500
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:02,400
But when they try to do that, it's not so easy to find out,

501
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,400
till you find the patient is lying

502
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,400
just on the death bed with the cirrhosis of the liver.

503
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,360
And then they certify, “Now you are going to die.”

504
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,680
But in Sahaja Yoga, if you have a liver,

505
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:17,640
at the very outset you can make it out that you have got a liver.

506
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,880
Because, as you know, on the fingers

507
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:22,400
it can be felt where the liver is,

508
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:26,040
and if you see that this Swadhishthana Chakra is catching,

509
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,440
with this centre of Nabhi Chakra,

510
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,400
then it means you have a bad liver.

511
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,880
And this liver is a very serious thing

512
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:38,080
because it makes a personality absolutely useless

513
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:41,480
for any communication after some time.

514
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:44,840
Now, the another thing is the neglect

515
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:48,680
of other centres, like, say, your spleen.

516
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,520
Now, this is a very serious thing.

517
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,160
Because if you are very hectic by temperament,

518
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,880
and if you are all the time thinking of future: “I have to go,

519
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:59,120
I have to attend the office, I have to do this, I have to do that”

520
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:01,360
that time this centre,

521
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:06,040
which is called as the , we call it the left Nabhi centre,

522
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,360
gets excited.

523
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:11,760
And it hasn't got that  we should say, the

524
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
it hasn't got that attention that it requires,

525
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:20,200
so it becomes very hectic itself. It goes into an emergency.

526
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:23,200
All the time attending to an emergency, it is producing

527
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:27,840
more more red blood corpuscles, and you become absolutely hectic.

528
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,320
For example, people in the morning read the newspaper.

529
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:33,760
First shock comes to them from the newspaper, somebody died,

530
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,760
something happened, something horrible things happened.

531
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,400
Naturally, the poor spleen goes into action,

532
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,880
and it starts producing red blood corpuscles.

533
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,280
That time you are having your breakfast, for example,

534
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:48,760
so all swadhisthan emergency. Then you are suddenly rushing out.

535
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,200
On the way you see lot of this traffic,

536
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,200
and you have to catch up with the time and all that.

537
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:57,080
All this modern life makes you that hectic,

538
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:01,520
nervous, hasty, we can say, and a speedy person.

539
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:05,240
This speed , actually the speedometer is your spleen.

540
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:10,160
So poor spleen goes into a bizarre state.

541
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:13,240
It cannot control your speed,

542
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,920
and it has to , it tries to keep the speed with you,

543
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:19,000
your hectic nature. It becomes hectic itself.

544
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,800
And then a disease

545
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:25,680
which we call as leukemia, the blood cancer, can develop.

546
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:29,800
Blood cancer is the result of this kind of temperament and nature.

547
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:33,000
Now, there are many children who get blood cancer. I have seen,

548
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:36,280
I have seen many children suffering from blood cancer.

549
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,160
And these children get it from the parents

550
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,480
who are like this, hectic parents,

551
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:44,920
who are anxious: “We must go to the office, we must do this,

552
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:48,080
we must get that” so many things at the same time.

553
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:51,480
And such people get this trouble called leukemia,

554
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:54,680
and is absolutely curable through Sahaja Yoga.

555
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:57,680
It is absolutely curable through Sahaja Yoga.

556
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:02,480
It's not difficult to cure leukemia, but you have to continue with,

557
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:05,160
you have to continue with the practices of Sahaja Yoga,

558
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,520
so that you absolutely get cured,

559
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:11,560
and then you can cure the leukemia of other people.

560
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:15,200
Another thing that can happen to you is the kidney trouble.

561
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,600
You see, the kidney becomes overactive.

562
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:20,200
The activity of the kidney ,too much ,

563
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:23,800
creates a problem within us which we call as hypertension,

564
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:26,880
by which we get high blood pressures and things like that.

565
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:29,840
People always tell, “I suffer from high blood pressure.”

566
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,920
Dr. Warren himself, when he came to Me,

567
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:35,080
was a patient of high blood pressure and many other problems.

568
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,320
But after Sahaja Yoga, you settle down.

569
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:41,080
You find you strike the balance.

570
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:44,360
You strike the balance because you don't think so much.

571
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:47,680
The thinking that goes on like mad stops.

572
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:50,120
If you want to think, you can think.

573
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,120
If you don't want to think, you just don't think.

574
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,080
You can stop it and sleep.

575
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,560
But if you want to think, you can think it.

576
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:59,680
But I've met a doctor in Geneva who came to Me, he said,

577
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:02,760
“Mother, cut my throat, do what you like, but stop this thinking.”

578
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,080
You see, it's so disgusting for some people

579
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,640
that even if I don't want to think, this brain goes on

580
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,200
chuck-chuck-chuck-chuck-chuck-chuck, like that,

581
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,280
troubling me so much.

582
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:15,200
But it is because of this centre, which has got out of its balance,

583
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,360
and it does not know how to control,

584
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,440
and that's why these things happen.

585
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:25,320
Then, your uterus also, women who think too much also can become,

586
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,600
they may not produce any children.

587
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:30,240
It's possible that they can become barren women

588
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:33,560
because there's no nourishment to that uterus,

589
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,440
and maybe they might develop troubles of the uterus.

590
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:40,760
All these troubles come from this overthinking,

591
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,840
futuristic attitude, speediness in life.

592
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:46,040
One of them is diabetes.

593
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:49,320
Now, diabetes will not occur

594
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:52,600
to any ordinary farmer who doesn't think so much.

595
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:56,640
But it will always happen to a man who's thinking about a big plan

596
00:36:56,840 --> 00:37:00,880
of how to project himself, his business plan, or his other plans.

597
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,640
All such people get diabetes.

598
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,560
The reason is he thinks so much that there's no attention left

599
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:10,440
to that poor pancreas, and the pancreas gets sick,

600
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:14,000
and that's how he gets this disease of diabetes,

601
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:16,920
which is supposed to be incurable. Not in Sahaja Yoga.

602
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:20,280
In Sahaja Yoga diabetes is absolutely curable.

603
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,760
Jaundice and all these diseases of the liver

604
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,760
are also absolutely curable in Sahaja Yoga.

605
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,280
By giving the balance to the people you can achieve a lot.

606
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:32,000
Because this is what all the prophets told us,

607
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:36,120
that we should lead a life of moderation,

608
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,400
not to go to extremes.

609
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:42,360
If you go to extremes, then you are not dharmic,

610
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,320
means you are not sustenant,

611
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,680
you are not sustaining yourself properly.

612
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:52,760
Now, these are ten valencies within us, in the human beings.

613
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:55,680
In the carbon, there are four valencies, as you know.

614
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:59,280
In every element there are eight valencies,

615
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:05,200
and these valencies become ten valencies in the human beings.

616
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:08,160
Now, these are the ten dharmas, as they call it,

617
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:11,080
or the ten kind of behaviour,

618
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,440
or ten kind of sustenance we have to look after.

619
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:18,760
If we do not keep that balance of these ten things,

620
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,880
then we go off the balance. Like Buddha has told you

621
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:24,440
that you have to keep to the central path of ascent.

622
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:26,280
And that's what exactly it is

623
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:29,320
that we have to keep to the central path of ascent,

624
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:32,040
and if we cannot keep to the central path of ascent,

625
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:36,440
then we suffer from, first of all, the physical problem.

626
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:39,320
First of all we suffer from the physical problem,

627
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,600
and then we suffer also from mental problem

628
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,720
because we go into an imbalance.

629
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:47,000
Now, when this chakra moves to the left side,

630
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:49,920
we get into mental problems.

631
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,840
Because when it goes to the left side, what happens is

632
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:58,920
that we start using things like for our emotional behaviour

633
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:02,040
and emotional expressions, and too much of it.

634
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:05,200
As a result of that, what happens to us

635
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:09,320
that we become possessed by another force,

636
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,560
that resides beyond this centre.

637
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:15,520
And beyond this centre resides the collective subconscious.

638
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:18,680
Now, this collective subconscious is a very dangerous area

639
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,400
where people should not enter.

640
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:23,240
Any person who says, “I am very devoted,

641
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,080
I am very dedicated, I must do this”

642
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:29,640
without getting connection with the God, if you do all these things,

643
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:33,440
your whole attention can be ruined.

644
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:36,680
For example, supposing there's , there's a telephone,

645
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,120
and you are not connected,

646
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:41,040
and you are using the telephone very fast, then what will happen?

647
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:44,640
The telephone will go out of order, and you will have no connection.

648
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:49,320
In the same way, the people who very earnestly try to do something

649
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:53,120
without having connection with God move to the left side,

650
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,840
which is called as the collective subconscious area.

651
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:58,920
And this is a very very dangerous area within us.

652
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:02,440
From there, many things ,

653
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:05,480
which the doctors call as protein 58,

654
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:09,480
but we call them as dead souls attacking.

655
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:12,400
Doctors call it as protein 58

656
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,080
because they don't now what they are.

657
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:18,040
But they say that these proteins come from the area

658
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,280
which is unknown

659
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:24,800
but existed within us since the day of creation.

660
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,920
That means it is collective subconscious.

661
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:30,680
And these proteins, like 52 and proteins 58,

662
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,440
they have tried to even photograph.

663
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,480
And they said that when they attack us,

664
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:39,680
then only cancer is triggered.

665
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:42,760
But the vulnerable position of the cancer

666
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,400
is created by our extreme behaviour.

667
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:49,920
Now how cancer is created, we should try to understand.

668
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,400
For example, the left side and the right side

669
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:56,160
as I told you, there are two powers, left and right-side powers,

670
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:59,080
which we work out, for example, the emotional on the left,

671
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,840
and, on the right-hand side, we have a power

672
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:05,040
which we call as the power of action,

673
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:10,680
where your physical and your mental efforts are expressed.

674
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,840
Now, when you go to the extreme of this, then

675
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:17,040
what happens the connection between the left and right breaks.

676
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:19,760
Just breaks. And when it breaks,

677
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,760
you start getting the power on its own

678
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,680
because it breaks the connection with the whole.

679
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:30,040
So, it is very arbitrary, it is not coordinated.

680
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,480
It doesn't cooperate with the whole body,

681
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:34,520
it just starts growing by itself.

682
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:37,760
And one cell becomes big, or cells in the nose

683
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,760
start becoming big and start covering the whole face.

684
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:45,160
There's no relationship between the different organs

685
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:49,560
and different parts of the face.

686
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:54,360
It just starts growing, overpowering other , other cells,

687
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:58,720
and that's how we call it a malignant growth, or malignant cell.

688
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:02,400
Now, when you go on like that, what happens it breaks.

689
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,480
And the deity  the one which controls it,

690
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:09,920
the one which is inside it just sleeps off.

691
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:13,880
At that time, the best thing would be to awaken the deity.

692
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:17,200
If you can awaken the deity, the whole thing comes back,

693
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:20,320
and that's how we can cure the cancer of people.

694
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:24,200
It's true, Sahaja Yoga can cure cancer. I have been telling this

695
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:27,800
for the last, I don't know, twelve years or so,

696
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:30,880
that it's only through Sahaja Yoga cancer will be cured.

697
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:34,760
Now we have many doctors who are doing cancer research and all that.

698
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,120
And we have one doctor, Shivardhan,

699
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:40,080
who is doing a research now on cancer,

700
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:43,920
and he has accepted this, that it is only Sahaja Yoga

701
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,800
will cure cancer, otherwise nothing can cure it,

702
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,640
because when human beings go to the extremes,

703
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:53,120
to the right or to the left, they do this to themselves,

704
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:58,560
and they are vulnerable to be triggered by some sort of a protein

705
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:02,760
which enters into your being and triggers this cancer.

706
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,040
That's why doctors can remove your nose, they can remove your ears,

707
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,120
they can remove this, they can remove that.

708
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:10,640
But they can't remove the base of cancer,

709
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:14,080
and the base of cancer is the centre, the subtle centre.

710
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:17,240
And to attack that subtle centre,

711
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:20,040
one has to become a subtle person.

712
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:23,760
The doctors have to become self-realized, so that they can attack.

713
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Now, in Sahaja Yoga we have many doctors,

714
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:30,600
and some are Russians, some are English, some are Indians,

715
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,800
and they are all working it out together.

716
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:35,640
And maybe that we may be able to publish a book

717
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:39,160
on how to cure cancer with Sahaja Yoga,

718
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:42,240
or how we have cured cancer with Sahaja Yoga.

719
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:48,200
But the main thing is that we are not here to cure people,

720
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:51,040
not to give cure to everyone,

721
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:53,280
every Dick, Tom and Harry, as you can say,

722
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,760
but we are here to give you realization.

723
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:01,840
God's interest is in people who are who are seeking God,

724
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:05,560
who are God's people. He is not interested in devils.

725
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:09,040
Supposing tomorrow Hitler gets cancer

726
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:11,120
God won't be interested in curing him.

727
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:15,480
So God's interest is mainly in people who are seeking Him

728
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:18,120
and those who get enlightenment,

729
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:21,640
and after their enlightenment they can give light to others.

730
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:24,680
God doesn't bother about people who are just wasteful,

731
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:27,800
who are good for nothing. He has to look after the people

732
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:31,480
who really will take up the cause of God

733
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:34,080
and do His work after getting cured.

734
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:37,880
Now, we had a patient today, this morning, who came to us,

735
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:41,800
who went to some horrible guru and who paid a lot of money,

736
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:46,440
to get epilepsy and then a brain cancer.

737
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:49,720
Now, with Sahaja Yoga, he's very much cured. He is walking about.

738
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,400
Of course, doctors had given up hope,

739
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:53,120
they had prepared for his death and all that.

740
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:56,760
In your Perth we have got a case here

741
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,760
who is now completely cured; he talks well, he walks well,

742
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,280
and everything is going on well with him.

743
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:06,280
But for this he had to come to Sahaja Yoga.

744
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:09,560
God is not going to fall at your feet: “Oh God …

745
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:13,120
that Oh please, listen to Me, you are very sick,

746
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:15,760
and you must get well, and this should happen.”

747
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,320
God is not interested. You have to be interested in Him.

748
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:22,320
That is one thing that you have to be interested.

749
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:25,440
Say, your Prime Minister, if you want to meet him,

750
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:28,080
he is not going to come and say, “All right, come and see me,

751
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:31,160
I want to meet you, please come.” You have to go and see him.

752
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:32,600
He's just a Prime Minister.

753
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:35,200
But this I am talking about who is the Prime Minister

754
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:37,480
of all the Prime Ministers, the highest of all.

755
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:39,760
So you have to be interested about God,

756
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,840
you have to get to Him, you have to ask for it,

757
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:44,880
otherwise He is not going to fall at your feet.

758
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:46,760
That's important to understand.

759
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:50,920
Now, so this centre is I've told you about Swadhishthana.

760
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:54,120
Now, the next centre is the centre of Nabhi,

761
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:57,560
which they have already explained to you what is Nabhi Chakra is,

762
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:01,760
but we must know what diseases are caused by bad Nabhi Chakra.

763
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,760
First, it is on the left-hand side and right-hand side.

764
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:09,000
There are two types of people: “left Nabhi” and “right Nabhi”.

765
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,600
The people who suffer from right Nabhi are the people

766
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:14,600
who have got all the problems of the liver.

767
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:19,760
Now, there was a gentleman who was writing a thesis on alcohol,

768
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,200
what is the ,

769
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:27,320
what is the chemical reaction on liver

770
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:29,760
when we take alcohol.

771
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,760
And through Sahaja Yoga only he realized

772
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,200
what happens actually to this.

773
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:39,000
That water is, as you know, is H2O.

774
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:44,600
So H ions are on both the sides, and O is here, is bound by that.

775
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:47,880
H2O, there are two H and one O.

776
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:53,280
Now, when you start taking water, it gives normal like that.

777
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:57,640
And when the blood in the water comes in contact with the liver,

778
00:46:57,840 --> 00:46:59,280
the liver has the function

779
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:02,560
to take away all the poison from the body as heat.

780
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:06,560
It absorbs the heat and then transfers it as bile,

781
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:09,240
and it goes out of your system.

782
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:13,760
But if you take, say alcohol and all these things

783
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,800
in a very strong way and not in moderation but is too much,

784
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:19,800
then what happens — this edge goes down like this,

785
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:24,560
and a barrier is created; and when it goes near the liver,

786
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:28,240
liver cannot suck in the heat, it cannot suck in the heat.

787
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:30,400
And that's how the heat is accumulated,

788
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:32,440
the liver goes on malfunctioning,

789
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:35,040
and you always have the trouble of the liver.

790
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:37,280
But supposing you come to Sahaja Yoga.

791
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:40,160
Then edge moves like that,

792
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:44,640
and all that is heat within you is passed into the liver.

793
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:47,920
You'll be amazed, when you will be doing Sahaja Yoga just now,

794
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:50,760
we'll be raising your Kundalini , in the beginning you'll find

795
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,040
lot of heat will be coming out of your head

796
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:56,120
before you start feeling the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost.

797
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:59,000
First the heat from the liver will be pouring out,

798
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:01,320
and you will feel very relieved when it's poured out,

799
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:03,840
and then you will start feeling the cool breeze

800
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:05,480
of the Holy Ghost in your hands ,

801
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:08,480
which is the all-pervading Power of God, as I told you

802
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:11,000
that first time, after realization,

803
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:13,640
you can feel that cool breeze within you.

804
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:18,360
Now, this chakra gets spoilt on the subtle

805
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:20,400
when you are very money-oriented.

806
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:23,120
If you are a very money-oriented person

807
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:26,000
and you are always thinking about money, how to get more money,

808
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:28,440
like mad, you see there's a rat race of money,

809
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:30,000
then this centre goes out.

810
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:34,560
And when this centre goes out, a person suffers from other troubles,

811
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:37,400
not from money troubles maybe but other troubles,

812
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:39,760
like he is emotionally dried out.

813
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,280
He becomes an unemotional person.

814
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:45,800
He becomes a person who has no feelings for anyone.

815
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:49,400
Then, I have seen you must have heard about

816
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:52,000
the great dacoits [gangs of armed robbers] in India.

817
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:54,320
And there is a lady who was a dacoit,

818
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:58,160
a small little lady of four feet height.

819
00:48:58,360 --> 00:48:59,760
And she was a person,

820
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,840
she was devoid of any emotions, she could kill anybody,

821
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:05,480
she could do anything as long as she got the money.

822
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:08,920
I mean, the whole emotional side is completely blocked

823
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:12,160
of such a person who thinks too much of money all the time,

824
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:16,760
and gradually he becomes very materialistic.

825
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,880
And a person who is materialistic neglects his heart,

826
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:23,360
all the time, he neglects his emotions.

827
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:25,240
He's worried more about the carpets,

828
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,200
more about this, more about that,

829
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:30,800
than the emotions of the people, than the feelings of the people.

830
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:33,240
And this kind of imbalance can come

831
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:36,080
when your Nabhi Chakra goes out of order

832
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:39,760
and you start putting all your attention to money.

833
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,400
Now, it's most surprising that the countries which are affluent

834
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:47,720
have more money orientation than the people who are not.

835
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:49,440
It's very surprising.

836
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:51,760
Say, for example, in an Indian village,

837
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,000
a person may not have so many things as you people have,

838
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,320
but if you go to him, he'll be very happy,

839
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:59,640
whatever he has, he would like to serve you ,

840
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:01,320
his food , anything that he has.

841
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:05,040
He would not like to see that you have not taken your food

842
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:07,760
or your milk or something at his residence.

843
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,000
He'll feel so obliged that you go and you serve him

844
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:16,040
with that joy and with that love that he has.

845
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:18,200
He would like to express his love.

846
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:19,600
Now, people misunderstand.

847
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:21,760
I've seen, people who are affluent misunderstand.

848
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,760
They think it's a slavishness. It is not.

849
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,120
It is that they find joy in emotional life,

850
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:29,760
in expressing their joy. To them, it does not matter

851
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,640
if he has to starve for the day, doesn't matter.

852
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:34,240
But he has given you food, so he feels that satisfaction:

853
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:37,320
“Oh, God, he has eaten at my place. So sweet of him.”

854
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:42,440
There's no slavishness, but is a kind of an expression of that love.

855
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:45,240
But in the West I found that people say

856
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:48,440
that if you do that to somebody, then people misunderstand,

857
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:51,280
they think you are a weak person, as a sign of your weakness.

858
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:53,920
I mean, I was amazed how can it be.

859
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:57,720
I live in an area which is supposed to be very posh,

860
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:01,560
and very, very rich people live there, very rich people.

861
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:07,160
And once it was snowing, snowing very heavily in that area,

862
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:10,240
and I, we were shifting that very same day.

863
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:13,480
So, I went round ,there's a square where we live,

864
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:17,200
so I went round the square and I deposited some things

865
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:20,320
and I saw a lady standing outside

866
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:24,280
with a little baby in a pram, and another lady

867
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:27,080
had opened her door little bit and talking to her there.

868
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:30,200
And that little baby was in the pram, and it was snowing,

869
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:32,440
can you imagine? And this lady was talking.

870
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:34,480
I came back after half an hour,

871
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:38,040
still the lady was standing outside, she wouldn't open the door.

872
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:40,400
And they are extremely rich people.

873
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:43,560
I can't understand how can a person

874
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:46,480
not feel that a little baby is in the pram.

875
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:47,920
They hate children there.

876
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:51,680
I've seen, in that area, the people just hate their children.

877
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:54,240
They beat them so badly, I'm amazed.

878
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:55,760
And they give it to the servants,

879
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,560
and the servants look after the children.

880
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:00,120
In England, you'll be amazed

881
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:03,760
that two children are killed by their parents every week.

882
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,400
First I used to think it is England, but it's not so.

883
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:08,920
It is only in London this is happening.

884
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:10,760
Can you believe a thing like that?

885
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,840
I mean, in India, I can't think of one woman doing that.

886
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:16,240
So, emotionally they are very strong people,

887
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:18,360
but they lack other things which you have,

888
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:21,040
which is to be combined with East and West

889
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:23,120
and has to be brought to a balance.

890
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:24,920
It should not be only emotional life,

891
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:27,280
that you want to have more children and more children.

892
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:29,320
That's why more children are born in that country.

893
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:31,040
They like to have more children.

894
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:32,240
Apart from that,

895
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:34,920
they are the only people who look after their children so well,

896
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:37,280
so all children want to be born there also.

897
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:40,040
They would not like to be born in places where the mother is hard,

898
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:43,480
very hottie, and angry for only a little carpet being spoilt,

899
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:45,240
or something if the children are spanked.

900
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:47,240
So, naturally, they would like to be born

901
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:50,320
with parents who are natural, who are sweet to them.

902
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:51,760
And that must be one of the reasons

903
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,040
why we are suffering from overpopulation.

904
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:57,840
While in Germany it is minus, in London it is minus.

905
00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:01,840
You go to Norway, it is minus, it is Sweden, it is minus.

906
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:04,160
On top of that, people are committing suicides.

907
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:08,760
They are competing among themselves, who is doing it more.

908
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,600
For example, if you go to , first I heard

909
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:14,640
that it was in Sweden people were committing suicide more,

910
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:19,040
but now it's Switzerland has taken over, and they are double

911
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:21,400
the number who are committing suicide.

912
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:23,120
It's I can't understand.

913
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:26,560
I had about three girls from Cambridge, who came from Sweden.

914
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:28,760
And they came to Me, and their vibrations were

915
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,240
like dead people, absolutely numb.

916
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:33,120
I was shocked, these young girls

917
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:36,560
between, say, sixteen or twenty, something like that,

918
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:40,320
why should they not have that feeling of exuberance,

919
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:44,040
that joy within them, bubbling with life, such young girls.

920
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:46,760
And I asked them, I said, “You come and see Me in the house.”

921
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,320
I mean, I was really surprised.

922
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:51,440
And when they came to see Me, I asked them, “What are you doing?”

923
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:53,520
They said, “Mother, to tell you the truth,

924
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:56,040
we are just planning how to commit suicide.”

925
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:57,640
Can you believe it?

926
00:53:57,840 --> 00:53:59,240
It's such a tragic thing.

927
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:01,440
Young girls just planning how to commit suicide.

928
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:05,720
But I said, “Why? Why you not? What is so much?”

929
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:08,200
They said, “We have, nobody gives us love, nobody loves us,

930
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:10,720
there's no love for us.

931
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:12,400
We've got money, we've got everything,

932
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:15,280
we are daughters of rich families, but there's no love.

933
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:18,720
And that's how we want to commit suicide.” Just imagine!

934
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:22,400
This is what is happening when one goes too much to materialism.

935
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:24,880
Matter can never give us joy, take it from Me.

936
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:28,440
It is also in economic science that

937
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:32,880
the material things cannot give you satisfaction, in general.

938
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:35,560
They can give one particular thing: you buy, now you buy this,

939
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:37,120
all right, then you want to buy that,

940
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:38,560
then you want to buy something else.

941
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:41,120
But in general, they are not satiable.

942
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:44,040
That means matter cannot give us joy.

943
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:46,560
That I do not say that we should not use the matter.

944
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:49,240
You can use the matter for your purpose also

945
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:51,360
when you know how to give it to others.

946
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:53,640
The joy of matter is in giving.

947
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:55,480
Perhaps we have missed the point,

948
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:59,240
but after Sahaja Yoga you will know that the joy of matter

949
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:02,280
is only felt when you see the beauty of matter

950
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:07,240
and when you see what it is to give to others.

951
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:08,440
To give to others.

952
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:11,280
It's not for yourself that you can ever enjoy,

953
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:14,560
but only by giving others you enjoy the matter.

954
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:17,040
All right, that's going to a very subtle point,

955
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:19,480
but that is what happens to you,

956
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:22,080
that you become extremely generous,

957
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:26,720
and as a result of that, you enjoy the bliss and happiness,

958
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:29,560
and your own generosity within yourself.

959
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:31,680
I'm supposed to be extremely generous,

960
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:34,280
and sometimes Sahaja Yogis are quite worried about Me

961
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:37,280
that, by the time I return, I will be finishing with all My saris

962
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:39,520
and nothing will be left out of them.

963
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:41,320
And they are all the time telling Me,

964
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:43,400
“Mother, be careful, You are extremely generous.”

965
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:45,280
But I enjoy My generosity,

966
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:48,600
I do not enjoy these possessions so called than My generosity.

967
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:50,560
Because if you have a possession, it's a headache.

968
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:52,160
You have to go to the insurance,

969
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:54,080
you have to worry that it should be kept all right.

970
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:56,800
It's better to give it to somebody else and see on other people

971
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:58,040
than to have your own.

972
00:55:58,240 --> 00:55:59,840
If you own it, it's a headache to you.

973
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:02,440
But if you give it to others, it's nice. You enjoy it all right.

974
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:04,800
You enjoy this hall very well, without owning it.

975
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:06,760
If you had owned it, it could have been a headache for you

976
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,200
to go up there and look after everything, isn't it?

977
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:11,400
It's better not to own this thing.

978
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:14,360
Let others have the headache, and let's have the enjoyment.

979
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:18,320
That's what is the policy in Sahaja Yoga you try to adopt.

980
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:22,360
So now we have the centre, another centre which is very important —

981
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:26,640
is the centre of Heart, central Heart we call it,

982
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:30,240
is the centre of the Mother of the Universe.

983
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:32,680
In Sanskrit She is called as Jagadamba.

984
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:36,840
She is the one who stays there and gives you the sense of security.

985
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:38,640
She looks after the saints

986
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:41,360
who are trying to get out of this green thing,

987
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:43,560
we call it as the Ocean of Illusion.

988
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:47,400
She protects them, She gives them all the help, all the guidance,

989
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:51,160
and tries to pull them out of the illusion.

990
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:55,640
And this is the way She kills all the devils and the demons

991
00:56:55,840 --> 00:57:00,160
who are, like fake gurus, trying to put down the seekers

992
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:02,000
into the illusion more.

993
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:04,680
She is the one who's the remover of illusion,

994
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:07,840
and this incarnates again and again on this earth,

995
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:09,840
to help the seekers

996
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:14,680
to get out of the ocean of illusion.

997
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:18,920
But when this centre, as in childhood,

998
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:21,120
starts pulsating first,

999
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:25,920
the sternum bone creates lots of antibodies,

1000
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:29,280
and these are actually the soldiers of the Mother.

1001
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:32,800
And they go and get distributed in the whole body.

1002
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:35,200
When you see something coming up on you,

1003
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:38,120
you get a fear, and you get a palpitation in here.

1004
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:41,640
That time, that frequency of palpitation

1005
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:44,760
informs these antibodies to be alert,

1006
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:48,680
to fight the person who is trying to attack you.

1007
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:51,120
And that's why it is important to understand

1008
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:54,760
that this centre builds up your sense of security.

1009
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,520
If this centre is disturbed,

1010
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:59,360
your sense of security can be disturbed.

1011
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:04,080
Now, the disease of this centre is mainly is breast cancer.

1012
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:07,640
When a woman is insecured in her life, she feels insecured,

1013
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:09,320
then she develops this trouble.

1014
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:11,840
When she is insecured as a mother,

1015
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:14,480
she gets this trouble of breast cancer.

1016
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:18,440
Now, doctors won't believe it, but I have cured many breast cancers.

1017
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:21,480
And that can easily be cured by awakening

1018
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:27,800
this special power of the motherhood within you.

1019
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:30,240
You just become self-confident,

1020
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:33,280
and the diseases completely cured, eradicated,

1021
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:38,160
without, without going into any operation or anything like that.

1022
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:40,280
Now, there are two other centres you see.

1023
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:42,920
The one on the right is of your own father,

1024
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:45,760
and the left is of your own mother.

1025
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,480
Or, we can say, is a fatherhood and motherhood.

1026
00:58:48,680 --> 00:58:50,520
If you have been a bad father,

1027
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:54,640
or if your father has been not nice to you, this centre suffers.

1028
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:58,800
If this centre suffers, then you get the disease called asthma.

1029
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:00,600
Asthma can only be cured

1030
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:05,440
if you tell the person who is a Sahaja Yogi about your father,

1031
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:08,120
what's the problem is, if your father has died,

1032
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:10,440
if suddenly died, if you are missing him,

1033
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:15,200
or if there is a problem with your own child,anything like that.

1034
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:18,320
The quality of fatherhood, this is represented by that.

1035
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:22,280
The left side is the mother's thing.

1036
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:25,800
If the mother is not being very kind to the child,

1037
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:28,920
the child could be erratic and could be very volcanic

1038
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:31,920
and temperamental, very temperamental he becomes.

1039
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:33,920
If he had not seen his mother,

1040
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:38,000
or mother has been a very unkind person,

1041
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:42,040
then such a person can be absolutely insecured all the time

1042
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:46,000
and could be all the time demanding attention from others,

1043
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:49,640
and would be very very aggressive on that point.

1044
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:52,360
So this is what it is. One has to understand

1045
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:55,400
that these two centres within us are important.

1046
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:58,760
After Sahaja Yoga, you start understanding your parents.

1047
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,080
Even if they have been very nasty to you,

1048
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:04,600
you try to forgive them, and they also come round very well,

1049
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:07,440
and good relations are established with parents.

1050
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:11,120
Because you are seekers, sometimes the parents don't understand you.

1051
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:12,520
Because they have no seeking.

1052
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:16,480
That's the age group which may not understand your seeking.

1053
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:20,120
But when they see this transformation coming into you,

1054
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:23,120
then you completely changed, you are completely changed.

1055
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:28,160
I'll give you an example of a Swiss Sahaja Yogi who came to Me,

1056
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:31,880
who has written a very big book on Sahaja Yoga called Advent.

1057
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:34,360
This boy had a father who ,

1058
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:37,760
who was leading a life away from the family, gave up the mother,

1059
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:41,240
and he used to have some sort of a relationship,

1060
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:45,160
and he never had any good relations with his children.

1061
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:48,120
But when this boy came to Sahaja Yoga,

1062
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:51,760
and his younger brother, and his sister,

1063
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,920
he was amazed how they were transformed.

1064
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:57,000
Their ideas were transformed, they were leading such a nice life,

1065
01:00:57,200 --> 01:01:00,840
very sane life, and that they were looking after him also,

1066
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:04,280
and they were doing whatever is possible to

1067
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:05,920
just to make him happy.

1068
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:09,400
And this amazed him because they're not like other children

1069
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:11,040
who just try to, all the time,

1070
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:13,840
say sharp things to the father and all that.

1071
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:17,360
Now, one day, one of the Sahaja Yoginis met him

1072
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:19,760
in a hotel, somewhere,

1073
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:23,680
and another person started discussing about Sahaja Yoga.

1074
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:28,600
He said, “I wish I was born at a time when Sahaja Yoga had started,

1075
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:31,400
because I would not have wasted my life like that.”

1076
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:35,440
So the parents start seeing that how my children are changing,

1077
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:38,720
and then they take to your style of life,

1078
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:40,840
betterment of everything.

1079
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:45,640
Now, the last chakra I cannot tell you perhaps today,

1080
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:48,360
is the Vishuddhi Chakra, which you can read in the book

1081
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:51,760
because already there's lot of time and we have to have realization.

1082
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,400
But this is a very important chakra

1083
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:55,520
because this gives you collectivity.

1084
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:58,520
This is the centre of the Primordial Being,

1085
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:03,760
is the centre by which we know the whole, the Akbar,

1086
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,920
that they say, “Allah hu Akbar!”

1087
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:09,000
Is the Akbar, is the great Primordial Being,

1088
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:10,800
and we are part and parcel of that.

1089
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:14,080
So you feel the collectivity within you through this centre.

1090
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:17,000
Those who spoil this centre,

1091
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:20,760
you can spoil it by mantras, you can spoil it by talking too much,

1092
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:24,120
you may spoil it by not talking at all, all sorts of things.

1093
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:29,760
And this reflects in sixteen sub-plexuses of the cervical plexus,

1094
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:34,720
which has got to look after your nose, eyes, throat, neck,

1095
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:38,160
the muscles of the eyes, and your forehead also.

1096
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:42,480
Is a very important centre within us which gives us collectivity.

1097
01:02:42,680 --> 01:02:47,320
The sixth centre which is here is the centre of Agnya Chakra.

1098
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:49,520
Agnya Chakra is very important

1099
01:02:49,720 --> 01:02:53,200
because at this centre Lord Jesus Christ came in.

1100
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:56,320
He is the embodiment of that innocence, that Ganesha.

1101
01:02:56,560 --> 01:02:59,600
He came on this earth, incarnated,

1102
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:02,160
and He came with the special purpose.

1103
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:05,160
He came with the purpose to cross through that point,

1104
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:08,080
which was very much joined together

1105
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:11,920
because, as we have the desire too strong

1106
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:17,200
and then to act on it too strong, these two forces combine together

1107
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:19,840
in such a way that there is no gap in between.

1108
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:24,360
So He came to go through that gap, to go through that cross,

1109
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:27,160
and that's why His crucifixion has a big message

1110
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:29,760
that He came in our awareness

1111
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:34,640
to go through that position, which is very subtle,

1112
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:38,240
because He was Himself the subtlest of subtle.

1113
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:41,800
He was the one who was the Omkara,

1114
01:03:42,040 --> 01:03:47,480
is the one who was the Logos, as you call it,

1115
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:50,240
the vibrations, as you see.

1116
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:53,840
He was that, and because His body was also made of that,

1117
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:55,480
He could get His resurrection.

1118
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:59,160
So the Christianity has the message of resurrection.

1119
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:01,480
And this is the time of resurrection.

1120
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:04,120
Because He is at the gate there.

1121
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:06,520
We all have to pass through that gate.

1122
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:08,760
But when you pass through that gate,

1123
01:04:09,040 --> 01:04:12,120
what happens the Kundalini awakens Jesus Christ.

1124
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:13,920
And when Jesus Christ is awakened,

1125
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:17,520
both these institutions are of ego and superego are sucked in.

1126
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:19,480
Once they are sucked in, you find

1127
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:22,640
that this place in your head becomes opened out.

1128
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:24,760
When this place becomes opened out,

1129
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:29,760
you find that this Kundalini also starts pulsating,

1130
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,640
and afterwards you find Her coming out of your head

1131
01:04:32,840 --> 01:04:34,400
and giving you a cool breeze.

1132
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:37,160
That's how you achieve your Self-realization.

1133
01:04:37,360 --> 01:04:39,200
So that's how it happens.

1134
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:42,760
And the seventh chakra I think, when you come

1135
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,520
to the program of these centres and all that,

1136
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:47,920
they'll explain to you what is seventh chakra

1137
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:51,840
and how it is the integrated of all the six chakras,

1138
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:54,480
and the seventh one which is the heart here

1139
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:56,400
heart, which is the spirit.

1140
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:59,840
In the heart resides the spirit, and the nature of the spirit

1141
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:02,440
yesterday I tried to tell you in short.

1142
01:05:02,680 --> 01:05:05,640
That's what you have to be — Sat-Chit-Ananda,

1143
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:10,880
means truth, attention, and joy.

1144
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:13,640
Your attention gets enlightened,

1145
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:16,320
you get the absolute truth,

1146
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:18,760
and you become the joy.

1147
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,920
This should happen to all of you.

1148
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:23,600
I hope in this short time I've been able to explain to you

1149
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:27,360
the subtle side of these chakras as well as of the gross.

1150
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:29,200
But the subject matter is so great

1151
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:32,280
that you will be amazed that, at least from London, they have got

1152
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:35,120
at least thousand tapes here, which you can listen to them,

1153
01:05:35,320 --> 01:05:37,920
on various aspects and dimensions of life,

1154
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:40,040
and enjoy your realization.

1155
01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:43,000
Like a bird, after coming out of the egg,

1156
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:47,200
enjoys all the dimensions of beauty and the glory.

1157
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:50,800
May God bless you.

1158
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:54,440
If you have any questions, please ask Me.

1159
01:05:54,680 --> 01:05:56,840
There's one more thing, which somebody asked Me

1160
01:05:57,080 --> 01:05:59,920
about somebody who was curing, you see, someone,

1161
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:03,120
through so-called spiritual help. It's not God's help.

1162
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:07,200
As I told you, this is coming from the left or the right side,

1163
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:10,120
it's not God's help. Because if the God's power

1164
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:13,480
starts working in you, it transforms you also.

1165
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:16,040
If it does not transform you, you are just like a radio.

1166
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:18,920
The music is coming through it and going not to the radio.

1167
01:06:19,160 --> 01:06:23,360
But if it is transforming you completely, then it is God's work.

1168
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:25,760
Otherwise it is the work of these spirits,

1169
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,520
who are just trying to play some tricks.

1170
01:06:27,720 --> 01:06:29,920
They are busy bodies, so they just try to help you.

1171
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:32,080
But don't go near them, they are horrid.

1172
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:36,400
They'll remove one disease, and you'll have another one.

1173
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:48,480
Sahaja Yogi: Any questions?

1174
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:51,800
Shri Mataji: You stand there.

1175
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,920
Sahaja Yogi: Any questions?

1176
01:06:59,160 --> 01:07:00,760
Yes.

1177
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,280
Seeker: Mother, I understand

1178
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:05,400
that astrology is very important in India.

1179
01:07:05,720 --> 01:07:08,720
Astrology.

1180
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:13,680
For example, an individual not only an individual but a nation

1181
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:16,640
can be [unclear] [a particular] astrological [mirror].

1182
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:20,360
Is the same [unclear] chakras? For example

1183
01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:21,080
Shri Mataji: Yes.

1184
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:23,080
Seeker: Is Australia [being part of] [unclear] chakra,

1185
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:26,320
or India [unclear] chakra, or …

1186
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:29,560
Sahaja Yogi: Yeah. He speaks of the astrology.

1187
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:33,080
Shri Mataji: He's a realized soul, huh? So I can [unclear] him clearly.

1188
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:36,640
No problem. Now, it's true what you say, it's true.

1189
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:41,040
Also, that the centres that we have as you see, are seven centres;

1190
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:44,840
then we have moon and sun, mind centres;

1191
01:07:45,080 --> 01:07:48,360
and there are three above us, they are called ,

1192
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:50,320
I don't know if I should confuse you,

1193
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:54,000
but they are called as Ardha Bindu, Bindu and Valaya.

1194
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:56,480
These are three centres above realization.

1195
01:07:56,680 --> 01:07:59,320
These you have to achieve in your realization later on.

1196
01:07:59,560 --> 01:08:05,280
So, now we have twelve of these, and these twelve things make

1197
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:10,720
for the gross, we should say, for the gross ,

1198
01:08:11,040 --> 01:08:15,280
body of a human being through astrology.

1199
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:18,360
But we have in India a method

1200
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:20,640
which we call as Krishnamurti Paddhati [Krishnamurti's system],

1201
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:25,040
where they can talk about the spiritual side of these centres.

1202
01:08:25,240 --> 01:08:29,920
We have a very nice thing developed in India, very nice.

1203
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:35,080
Now, when these fake gurus came in,

1204
01:08:35,280 --> 01:08:40,400
their birthdays were taken into account,

1205
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:43,840
and immediately this astrologer casted horoscopes,

1206
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:46,160
and they said they are all fake, they are rakshasas,

1207
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:47,440
they are this, they are that.

1208
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:50,640
So they changed, all of them, their birthdays and everything.

1209
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:53,640
It's really remarkable how they changed their birthdays first

1210
01:08:53,840 --> 01:08:55,760
and then they said they don't remember, this, that,

1211
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:57,480
and all sort of things.

1212
01:08:57,680 --> 01:09:00,280
But you should see it

1213
01:09:00,480 --> 01:09:05,480
they have published a very authentic magazine,

1214
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:09,720
which is dealing from Madras, on astrology. My horoscope,

1215
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:13,120
it's amazing how they have predicted all the things,

1216
01:09:13,320 --> 01:09:15,800
even about Perth perhaps they have said

1217
01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:18,200
that I'll be touching Australia

1218
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:22,720
and the Australians will be the great Sahaja Yogis.

1219
01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:24,000
It's surprising!

1220
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:26,360
Sahaja Yogi: He also asked the question:

1221
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:31,280
“Is other chakras on this earth, and might Australia be a chakra?”

1222
01:09:31,480 --> 01:09:35,120
Shri Mataji: It is. Australia is the Mooladhara itself.

1223
01:09:35,320 --> 01:09:37,640
Is the biggest chakra that you could think of,

1224
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:41,760
is the Mooladhara, itself, is the first centre, you see?

1225
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:45,760
If you see, Perth is all red, everywhere, if you see;

1226
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:49,760
it's a you have got in the centre of Australia

1227
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,320
Shri Ganesha sitting down. What you call that?

1228
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:53,880
Sahaja Yogi: Ayers Rock.

1229
01:09:54,120 --> 01:09:57,840
Shri Mataji: Yes. As you can see, His trunk also red like that.

1230
01:09:58,080 --> 01:10:02,720
It's Mooladhara itself, it's one of the biggest centres

1231
01:10:02,920 --> 01:10:04,880
in Sahaja Yoga, is this …

1232
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:09,080
SY: And interestingly enough, it's precisely the same longitude of …

1233
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:10,720
Shri Mataji: Europe is the liver.

1234
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:13,920
Sahaja Yogi: … latitude of as the birth place of Shri Mataji.

1235
01:10:14,160 --> 01:10:16,880
Precisely the same latitude

1236
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:19,720
as the birth place of Shri Mataji in India.

1237
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:22,120
As it is on the tropic of Cancer,

1238
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:24,560
so it is on the tropic of Capricorn, almost.

1239
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:26,800
Shri Mataji: Yes, Australia is very important

1240
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:29,400
from Sahaja Yoga point of view, very important.

1241
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:32,400
You see, your basic quality is innocence, imagine.

1242
01:10:32,680 --> 01:10:37,120
Australia, according to Sahaja Yoga, Australia stands for innocence.

1243
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:39,720
Just a minute, just a minute. Let Me finish one.

1244
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:44,280
And this innocence is your basic quality,

1245
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:46,920
is your basic quality.

1246
01:10:47,240 --> 01:10:50,560
According to Sahaja Yoga, Europe is the liver.

1247
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:53,680
And London is the heart.

1248
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:57,000
India is the Kundalini.

1249
01:10:57,480 --> 01:11:00,920
Seeker: Do You know the correct translation for Nabhi?

1250
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:02,120
Shri Mataji: What did she say?

1251
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:04,640
Sahaja Yogi: The translation of the Nabhi?
Seeker: Yes.

1252
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:08,320
Shri Mataji: Nabhi means navel.

1253
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:12,320
All right? It's navel.

1254
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:16,240
Nabhi is ,I went to Athens,

1255
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:19,920
and they told Me this is the navel of the universe.

1256
01:11:20,160 --> 01:11:23,400
I've been telling them that Europe is the navel,

1257
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:26,560
and there I went, they said there in Delphi, they said

1258
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:30,280
this mount, it represents the navel of the Earth.

1259
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:33,040
So I tried to feel the vibrations , it was.

1260
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:35,720
But I turned round, I said, “Why these vibrations are coming?”

1261
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:38,160
And there it was, Shri Ganesha sitting there,

1262
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:40,000
like an elephant, little elephant.

1263
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:42,160
So I asked the translator, I said, “What is this?”

1264
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:45,560
She said, “Oh, little elephant sitting down there.” Just imagine.

1265
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:47,160
The Mother Earth has created.

1266
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:48,920
This is all created through Mother Earth.

1267
01:11:49,160 --> 01:11:51,760
Which is said in the Bible, that “Thou shalt not worship

1268
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:55,320
or reproduce something that is created by the Mother Earth.”

1269
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:57,920
And what is that? That we call as swayambhu,

1270
01:11:58,200 --> 01:12:00,440
the one which is created by Mother Earth.

1271
01:12:00,760 --> 01:12:03,440
And this is one of them, is your Shri Ganesha

1272
01:12:03,640 --> 01:12:08,760
created in the centre of Australia.

1273
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:12,240
Seeker: Do You also concentrate on Your Nabhi if You [unclear]

1274
01:12:12,440 --> 01:12:15,760
[unclear] of the Void?

1275
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:19,080
[unclear]?

1276
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:22,240
Sahaja Yogi: Sorry, your question is not clear.

1277
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:24,480
Shri Mataji: Please stand up, please stand up. All right?

1278
01:12:24,680 --> 01:12:25,840
We can't hear. Please.

1279
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:27,640
Sahaja Yogi: Stand up.
Shri Mataji: Yes, please.

1280
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:29,880
Seeker: When You do Your yoga concentration,

1281
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:33,760
do You [unclear] at the Void [unclear] Nabhi]?

1282
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:38,760
Sahaja Yogi: When you do Your yoga concentration, as she calls it,

1283
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,680
do You concentrate on the Void as well as the Nabhi?

1284
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:44,120
Shri Mataji: No, no, not at all. No, not at all.

1285
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:46,720
Not to concentrate on your Nabhi or anywhere.

1286
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:51,760
Now see, concentration part doesn't play much part in Sahaja Yoga.

1287
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:55,200
First you allow your attention to be absolutely free, all right?

1288
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:56,840
Then the Kundalini rises.

1289
01:12:57,080 --> 01:13:01,600
She rises and comes out of your Brahmarandra, as we call it.

1290
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:04,640
In case your attention is very wobbly, then we'll say

1291
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:07,400
that pay attention here a little bit. But there's no need at all.

1292
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:09,680
The Kundalini comes up and She breaks through.

1293
01:13:09,880 --> 01:13:12,120
You have to leave your attention little loose,

1294
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:13,680
not to bother about it.

1295
01:13:13,880 --> 01:13:15,320
But later on what happens

1296
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:18,560
that when supposing you have a Nabhi problem, as you were saying,

1297
01:13:18,760 --> 01:13:21,120
in the solar plexus you have a problem,

1298
01:13:21,320 --> 01:13:24,000
the Kundalini will again go back and hit there,

1299
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:26,600
and your attention will be drawn automatically.

1300
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:29,840
You don't have to pay attention to it. You will, you will be drawn.

1301
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:32,800
Then by your attention you can raise the Kundalini.

1302
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:35,880
So you don't have to concentrate anywhere. Just like that.

1303
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:38,160
It's like if you are driving,

1304
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:41,080
then you have to just concentrate on driving itself.

1305
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:45,320
But if you concentrate on any point, you are finished.

1306
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:49,760
So you must know where you are and where you have to move.

1307
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,200
Before realization, there's no question of concentration.

1308
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:55,760
It can spoil you completely.

1309
01:13:56,760 --> 01:14:01,320
Seeker: Mataji, is realization synonymous with,

1310
01:14:01,640 --> 01:14:03,760
with enlightenment?
                        Shri Mataji: Yes, of course.

1311
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,360
Seeker: So all Your followers that have received realization

1312
01:14:06,680 --> 01:14:08,280
in fact enlightened?
                        Shri Mataji: Yes yes.

1313
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:11,120
You see, it means you have to be enlightened.

1314
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:13,520
It also means atmasakshatkar [one who realized his own spirit].

1315
01:14:13,720 --> 01:14:15,920
It also means what you call that

1316
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:18,760
to be the pir [saint in Sufism] in [this state].

1317
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:24,760
In Lao-Tze, I think … he says Tao, Tao,

1318
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,840
that's you have to become that. There are so many things.

1319
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:32,400
Everybody has said it is that you have to have.

1320
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:37,720
Yes?

1321
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:39,240
Seeker: Perhaps You could explain,

1322
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:42,000
the meaning of one occasion,

1323
01:14:42,200 --> 01:14:44,440
several years ago.

1324
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:47,640
It was a New Years eve when I was

1325
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:50,760
alone in the middle of Ayers Rock,

1326
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:54,240
now it started [unclear] full moon,

1327
01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:56,760
and I climbed up Ayers Rock

1328
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:01,480
with the intention of sleeping on Ayers Rock alone that night.

1329
01:15:01,680 --> 01:15:04,440
And just looking up,

1330
01:15:04,760 --> 01:15:10,240
Ayers Rock was right in the middle of [unclear].

1331
01:15:10,440 --> 01:15:12,360
And I was terrified, I [unclear],

1332
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:14,760
I couldn't stay on there... [unclear].

1333
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,680
Shri Mataji: He was trying over the Ganesha.

1334
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:19,720
Sahaja Yogi: He went up on the night with full moon,

1335
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:24,240
he was absolutely frightened and shaking and

1336
01:15:24,440 --> 01:15:26,440
Shri Mataji: On Ganesha's?

1337
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:29,880
Seeker: It was like being confronted with eternity.

1338
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:31,760
Sahaja Yogi: Like being confronted by eternity.

1339
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
Shri Mataji: My child, you have been to all horrible gurus, you see.

1340
01:15:34,200 --> 01:15:37,200
Naturally, Ganesha was trying to frighten you there.

1341
01:15:37,400 --> 01:15:39,760
He frightens, not only that, He is the one who gives you

1342
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:43,400
all these horrible experiences of heat and these blisters,

1343
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:45,360
and He is the one who gets angry,

1344
01:15:45,560 --> 01:15:47,680
because He doesn't like the way people are.

1345
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:51,920
You see, it's the one , He is the one who gets upset.

1346
01:15:52,160 --> 01:15:54,760
Kundalini is there, He looks after Her protocol.

1347
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,920
But He cannot understand why people are doing wrong things,

1348
01:15:58,160 --> 01:16:00,720
going to the , because He is wisdom, He is the embodiment of wisdom,

1349
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:03,920
and if you have done something unwise, He gets angry with you.

1350
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:06,560
That must be the reason.

1351
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:08,840
We have seen some people who come to Me also shake

1352
01:16:09,080 --> 01:16:12,360
with the beginning a little bit. Doesn't matter.

1353
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:16,440
Sahaja Yogi: Any other questions?

1354
01:16:19,400 --> 01:16:22,400
Shri Mataji: Are you all right now?
                        Seeker:      Yes, Mother.

1355
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:25,560
Shri Mataji: Good, good. So,doesn't matter.

1356
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:28,800
Sahaja Yogi: Yes?

1357
01:16:29,720 --> 01:16:34,040
Seeker: Can , can Mother heal me? I had a stroke some years ago.

1358
01:16:34,240 --> 01:16:35,200
Shri Mataji: What is it?

1359
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:38,480
Sahaja Yogi: Can she be healed? She had a stroke some years ago.

1360
01:16:38,680 --> 01:16:40,040
Shri Mataji: Yes, yes, of course.

1361
01:16:40,240 --> 01:16:42,400
Sahaja Yogi: Have you got paralysis? Partial paralysis.

1362
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:45,240
Shri Mataji: [Just listen], this is nothing that can't be healed,

1363
01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:47,920
no doubt.

1364
01:16:48,160 --> 01:16:51,480
Seeker: [unclear] I have received it,

1365
01:16:51,800 --> 01:16:57,120
and You have curing emanations,curing emanations,

1366
01:16:57,320 --> 01:17:01,760
that [unclear]

1367
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:03,360
Shri Mataji: I can't hear her.

1368
01:17:03,680 --> 01:17:06,440
Sahaja Yogi: Are you saying that She emits emanation, that …

1369
01:17:06,760 --> 01:17:10,920
Seeker: No. No, [unclear], [this was the problem].

1370
01:17:11,160 --> 01:17:12,920
And …

1371
01:17:13,160 --> 01:17:16,200
Shri Mataji: I can't hear her.

1372
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:19,480
Madam, please get up. We can't hear you. All right?

1373
01:17:19,680 --> 01:17:21,720
Seeker: I can understand about the enlightenment,

1374
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:24,240
but I can't understand about the emanations

1375
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:29,080
that You [unclear] [impossible]

1376
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:31,720
[unclear]

1377
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:32,720
Shri Mataji: What is she ,

1378
01:17:32,920 --> 01:17:34,440
Sahaja Yogi: She can understand about the enlightenment.

1379
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:37,480
She cannot understand about the emanations of,

1380
01:17:37,680 --> 01:17:39,840
probably she means Your power.

1381
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:42,680
Shri Mataji: You will understand that, all right? Gradually.

1382
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:45,840
Everything you can't understand in one day, can you?

1383
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:48,400
You will understand everything. You don't worry about Me.

1384
01:17:48,720 --> 01:17:50,200
You just worry about yourself.

1385
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:53,000
I've not said anything about Myself, have I said?

1386
01:17:53,200 --> 01:17:55,120
I never said anything.

1387
01:17:55,320 --> 01:17:59,680
I've been very humble. I've never said anything. I dare not.

1388
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:03,800
Because it's not wise, I've learnt it.

1389
01:18:04,040 --> 01:18:06,040
See, those who said it had a bad time.

1390
01:18:06,240 --> 01:18:08,160
It's difficult. If you say something about yourself,

1391
01:18:08,360 --> 01:18:11,240
suddenly the ego will come and just punch at you.

1392
01:18:11,440 --> 01:18:14,760
No, it's very bad. I've never said a word about Myself.

1393
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:16,600
So you don't try to understand Me just now,

1394
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:18,360
first you understand yourself, all right?

1395
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:21,760
Then you understand Me.

1396
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:23,800
Sahaja Yogi: Any other questions?

1397
01:18:24,040 --> 01:18:27,080
Otherwise we'll have the experience of Self-realization.

1398
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:28,920
This is what Mother has come for.

1399
01:18:29,160 --> 01:18:31,760
Really a lecture is not the important part,

1400
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,400
the experience of Self-realization is it.

1401
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:38,440
We'll switch the fans off, and you'll feel it for yourself.

1402
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:41,720
Any other questions?

1403
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:43,720
Could you turn the fans off?

1404
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:47,400
Seeker: If we're Your devotees, do you also look after us?

1405
01:18:47,720 --> 01:18:53,120
SY: If these people are Your devotees, do You look after them?

1406
01:18:53,320 --> 01:18:56,280
Shri Mataji: What else I,I look after them.

1407
01:18:56,480 --> 01:19:02,000
Ask them, better ask them if I've looked after them or not.

1408
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:05,240
Sahaja Yogi: I think it's obvious that

1409
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:08,040
insofar as all of us have got physically well;

1410
01:19:08,240 --> 01:19:13,440
our nervous, mental, psychological problems have been healed;

1411
01:19:13,680 --> 01:19:16,680
if we're endangered by an accident,

1412
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:21,360
if there's any particular problem which we want to solve,

1413
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:24,120
within our own life or within relationships,

1414
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:28,920
we put that at the attention of Almighty God,

1415
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:33,040
and by doing so we find that it gets solved.

1416
01:19:33,240 --> 01:19:37,760
We've got all sorts of little methods

1417
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,720
by which we work things out.

1418
01:19:40,920 --> 01:19:42,640
We showed you some of them today,

1419
01:19:42,840 --> 01:19:44,760
in working out how the chakras are cleared.

1420
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,720
You can learn all of these things at the centre.

1421
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:52,720
There are certain aspects which you won't fully understand

1422
01:19:52,920 --> 01:19:56,640
until you actually achieve the awakening of Kundalini,

1423
01:19:56,840 --> 01:19:59,000
but as you grow in it, you'll understand more fully

1424
01:19:59,200 --> 01:20:00,720
how the blessings of God

1425
01:20:00,920 --> 01:20:03,760
actually descend upon you in a tremendous way.

1426
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:07,760
You get, your well-being is cared for, your health is cared for.

1427
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:11,120
Your psychological problems are solved.

1428
01:20:11,320 --> 01:20:13,400
You become a complete and whole person,

1429
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:15,400
and this is the very beautiful part.

1430
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:18,360
When this lady asked is enlightenment synonymous

1431
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:20,520
with Self-realization,

1432
01:20:20,720 --> 01:20:24,000
the answer is yes, but it's a growth process.

1433
01:20:24,200 --> 01:20:27,760
You touch it or maybe you go more than that at the beginning

1434
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:31,040
and from that touching of Self-realization

1435
01:20:31,240 --> 01:20:34,800
you grow from that point to a complete realized being.

1436
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:37,360
But you are an enlightened being because you've started

1437
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:40,760
that final journey in your spiritual evolution.

1438
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:42,880
We've had a human evolution this far.

1439
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:45,320
Now we've reached our spiritual evolution,

1440
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:48,120
and the road is very very rapid now.

1441
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:50,760
Because in this lifetime we can achieve

1442
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,120
that state of full realization,

1443
01:20:53,320 --> 01:20:56,120
just by these techniques, very simple techniques

1444
01:20:56,320 --> 01:21:00,600
that will be shown to you by the devotees of Shri Mataji.

1445
01:21:00,840 --> 01:21:04,480
Shri Mataji: But I must confess one thing to you people:

1446
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:07,600
that your guru was very allergic to flowers and things,

1447
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:10,760
I'm very allergic to this dress, absolutely.

1448
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,720
Because this is not your style.

1449
01:21:12,920 --> 01:21:14,720
You see, this dress is to be worn by people

1450
01:21:14,920 --> 01:21:17,640
who lead an absolute celibate life

1451
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:21,080
and is meant for people who are not householders.

1452
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:24,240
And another thing is, if you read Valmiki Ramayana

1453
01:21:24,440 --> 01:21:27,200
I don't know people read that or not, where Shri Sita

1454
01:21:27,400 --> 01:21:31,080
has said that a sannyasi has nothing to do with householders at all.

1455
01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:37,120
If there's a real sannyasi, he should stay out of the city,

1456
01:21:37,320 --> 01:21:39,840
out of the village, only for one day.

1457
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:43,240
And he is to be given one-day alms and finished with it.

1458
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:45,400
Because you know what happened with Her,

1459
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:47,120
that Ravana came in this dress,

1460
01:21:47,320 --> 01:21:49,320
and that's how I'm very allergic to this dress.

1461
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:52,200
Because it's not true, it's not true.

1462
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:54,760
Have you renounced the whole world? You have not.

1463
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,320
So, not to go in for this kind of a thing,

1464
01:21:57,640 --> 01:22:01,440
you have to be normal people, you have to be living normally,

1465
01:22:01,640 --> 01:22:03,000
accepting what you are

1466
01:22:03,200 --> 01:22:05,360
and not announcing something which you are not.

1467
01:22:05,560 --> 01:22:06,800
You see, this is what the gurus do

1468
01:22:07,040 --> 01:22:08,640
they give you a dress and these things.

1469
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:10,440
So, if you want to have Sahaja Yoga

1470
01:22:10,760 --> 01:22:13,080
of course, today I hope I'll give you realization,

1471
01:22:13,280 --> 01:22:14,920
but afterwards you give up all this nonsense,

1472
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:16,160
you become normal people.

1473
01:22:16,360 --> 01:22:18,000
You have to be absolutely normal.

1474
01:22:18,200 --> 01:22:21,440
Nothing abnormal about it, recluses, funny type not.

1475
01:22:21,640 --> 01:22:24,080
We have to get the whole world out of [their ?] problems.

1476
01:22:24,280 --> 01:22:27,480
We can't just do it for ourself, individual some sort of a nonsense.

1477
01:22:27,720 --> 01:22:31,040
No, we have to be responsible for the whole world,

1478
01:22:31,240 --> 01:22:33,120
and we have to be absolutely normal people,

1479
01:22:33,320 --> 01:22:37,240
behave in a normal way, not in an abnormal way, all right?

1480
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:39,480
So I'm very allergic to this dress.

1481
01:22:39,680 --> 01:22:41,920
I'm just telling you, I hope I give you realization,

1482
01:22:42,160 --> 01:22:45,200
because you are seekers, I can see that, all of you are seekers.

1483
01:22:45,400 --> 01:22:46,760
You should get your realization.

1484
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:48,560
But I'm absolutely allergic to this.

1485
01:22:48,760 --> 01:22:50,360
Because their guru is allergic to flowers.

1486
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:53,640
Imagine, God is so fond of flowers. I can't do without flowers.

1487
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:59,720
I can't understand how can any saintly man be allergic to flowers.

1488
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:03,480
So …

1489
01:23:03,680 --> 01:23:07,680
Sahaja Yogi: OK. Then, any last question? Then we'll have it.

1490
01:23:09,200 --> 01:23:12,200
OK.
