00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.860
I bow to all the Sahaja Yogis.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.673
In this beautiful surround, surroundings,

00:00:41.175 --> 00:00:52.205
many of you are wondering why God has created these beautiful things.

00:00:52.285 --> 00:00:56.125
Because you people had to come on this Earth

00:00:56.205 --> 00:01:00.011
and enjoy the beauty that is one of the reasons.

00:01:00.091 --> 00:01:06.287
And now God feels very much fulfilled

00:01:06.367 --> 00:01:21.333
with the joy and satisfaction and a kind of a completion of His desire.

00:01:21.414 --> 00:01:30.715
Why God has created this beautiful universe
has been a question

00:01:30.795 --> 00:01:34.500
asked for thousands of
years.

00:01:36.706 --> 00:01:42.773
The reason is very simple to understand:

00:01:42.853 --> 00:01:50.159
this beauty that is created cannot see itself.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:02:00.610
In the same way, God who is the source of
beauty, cannot see its own beauty,

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.624
like a pearl cannot enter into itself to see its beauty,

00:02:05.705 --> 00:02:12.112
like the sky cannot understand its own beauty,

00:02:12.192 --> 00:02:17.411
the stars cannot see their own beauty,

00:02:17.491 --> 00:02:29.369
the Sun cannot behold its own brilliance.

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:39.258
In the same way God Almighty cannot behold
His own being.

00:02:39.338 --> 00:02:42.588
He needs a mirror

00:02:42.668 --> 00:02:50.532
and that is how He has created this
beautiful universe as His mirror.

00:02:50.612 --> 00:02:57.079
In this mirror He has created now beautiful things like the Sun,

00:02:57.159 --> 00:03:03.977
then the Sun has to see his own reflection also.

00:03:05.418 --> 00:03:11.127
So, he has created these beautiful trees to see that

00:03:11.207 --> 00:03:18.699
when he shines, they come up so well and look so green.

00:03:18.779 --> 00:03:23.903
Then He has created those birds to rise early in the morning

00:03:23.983 --> 00:03:31.250
 to greet the Sun, so the Sun knows that: “Yes, I am there, I am existing”;

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:37.220
or else He has created these beautiful lakes
for these trees to see their reflection

00:03:37.406 --> 00:03:43.960
and the lakes to feel their existence when the
ripples start moving within themselves.

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.610
So then He created human beings.

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:52.539
The human beings cannot also see their own beauty, their own glory.

00:03:52.619 --> 00:03:56.770
That is why they are in the darkness, they are ignorant.

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:02.313
They cannot see what lies within themselves.

00:04:02.393 --> 00:04:09.669
So they are running after something
which is absolutely against themselves,

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:15.982
which is ugliness, which is self destructive.

00:04:16.081 --> 00:04:21.909
And the struggle to get to is such a lot,

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:25.364
that as a result, they destroy themselves.

00:04:25.445 --> 00:04:30.832
Like as people have taken to these drugs, taken to all bad
habits

00:04:30.912 --> 00:04:34.330
– of in this place, they say a lot of smuggling going on –

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:39.601
and all such endeavors that people take up because they do not know

00:04:39.681 --> 00:04:42.240
what beautiful things they are.

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:48.437
So now a mirror has to be created for them,
to see for themselves how beautiful they are.

00:04:48.518 --> 00:04:52.571
Their mirror is their Spirit.

00:04:52.651 --> 00:04:57.818
That Spirit is to be brought in their consciousness, their attention.

00:04:57.898 --> 00:05:03.227
If it comes in their attention then they can see their image.

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:13.328
Now this attention that comes in as an enlightened attention

00:05:13.408 --> 00:05:19.380
is called in Sanskrit language as chidabhas

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:25.342
is the expression of the attention which is enlightened.

00:05:25.422 --> 00:05:32.564
But it is also said that it is got a nature, which is very transitory,

00:05:32.644 --> 00:05:38.556
or, we can say, which is disappearing every moment to moment.

00:05:38.636 --> 00:05:42.661
When
this is happening what is to be done?

00:05:42.741 --> 00:05:48.796
For that you have to steady yourself with meditation,

00:05:48.876 --> 00:05:54.535
with hearing the enlightened talks,

00:05:54.615 --> 00:06:03.490
by seeing the good things of life without thinking about them,

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:08.252
by seeing also the goodness of others

00:06:08.332 --> 00:06:12.534
and then you start seeing
goodness in yourself also.

00:06:12.614 --> 00:06:16.390
That is why I always say that one should not feel guilty.

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:24.722
Because you are feeling guilty of something, which is just, just an illusion.

00:06:24.816 --> 00:06:29.747
You are guilty that you have got a shadow. It is something like that.

00:06:29.827 --> 00:06:33.422
So if you know that you are beautiful beings

00:06:33.502 --> 00:06:39.270
and that you have got a shadow is nothing to do with you and your beauty.

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:45.879
If you can see you own beauty then you will be amazed that within us lies

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:52.148
all those joy giving, all those beautiful
things, which we are seeing outside.

00:06:52.228 --> 00:06:54.828
But just now, the mirror is not all right,

00:06:54.908 --> 00:06:58.116
that’s
why you have to see in the nature the beauty.

00:06:58.197 --> 00:07:08.524
But, when you are one with your Self, then
you see all these nature within yourself,

00:07:08.605 --> 00:07:12.260
all the joy giving qualities of this nature within yourself.

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:18.820
So I wanted you to come to this place just
to learn how God has created this beautiful

00:07:20.246 --> 00:07:25.427
area for you people to enjoy and to be here.

00:07:25.507 --> 00:07:27.640
May God bless you.
