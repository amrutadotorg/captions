00:07.700 --> 00:10.860
I bow to all the Sahaja Yogis.

00:34.800 --> 00:38.673
In this beautiful surround, surroundings,

00:41.175 --> 00:52.205
many of you are wondering why God has created these beautiful things.

00:52.285 --> 00:56.125
Because you people had to come on this Earth

00:56.205 --> 01:00.011
and enjoy the beauty that is one of the reasons.

01:00.091 --> 01:06.287
And now God feels very much fulfilled

01:06.367 --> 01:21.333
with the joy and satisfaction and a kind of a completion of His desire.

01:21.414 --> 01:30.715
Why God has created this beautiful universe
has been a question

01:30.795 --> 01:34.500
asked for thousands of
years.

01:36.706 --> 01:42.773
The reason is very simple to understand:

01:42.853 --> 01:50.159
this beauty that is created cannot see itself.

01:50.360 --> 02:00.610
In the same way, God who is the source of
beauty, cannot see its own beauty,

02:00.690 --> 02:05.624
like a pearl cannot enter into itself to see its beauty,

02:05.705 --> 02:12.112
like the sky cannot understand its own beauty,

02:12.192 --> 02:17.411
the stars cannot see their own beauty,

02:17.491 --> 02:29.369
the Sun cannot behold its own brilliance.

02:29.450 --> 02:39.258
In the same way God Almighty cannot behold
His own being.

02:39.338 --> 02:42.588
He needs a mirror

02:42.668 --> 02:50.532
and that is how He has created this
beautiful universe as His mirror.

02:50.612 --> 02:57.079
In this mirror He has created now beautiful things like the Sun,

02:57.159 --> 03:03.977
then the Sun has to see his own reflection also.

03:05.418 --> 03:11.127
So, he has created these beautiful trees to see that

03:11.207 --> 03:18.699
when he shines, they come up so well and look so green.

03:18.779 --> 03:23.903
Then He has created those birds to rise early in the morning

03:23.983 --> 03:31.250
to greet the Sun, so the Sun knows that: “Yes, I am there, I am existing”;

03:31.330 --> 03:37.220
or else He has created these beautiful lakes
for these trees to see their reflection

03:37.406 --> 03:43.960
and the lakes to feel their existence when the
ripples start moving within themselves.

03:44.140 --> 03:47.610
So then He created human beings.

03:47.690 --> 03:52.539
The human beings cannot also see their own beauty, their own glory.

03:52.619 --> 03:56.770
That is why they are in the darkness, they are ignorant.

03:56.850 --> 04:02.313
They cannot see what lies within themselves.

04:02.393 --> 04:09.669
So they are running after something
which is absolutely against themselves,

04:09.750 --> 04:15.982
which is ugliness, which is self destructive.

04:16.081 --> 04:21.909
And the struggle to get to is such a lot,

04:21.989 --> 04:25.364
that as a result, they destroy themselves.

04:25.445 --> 04:30.832
Like as people have taken to these drugs, taken to all bad
habits

04:30.912 --> 04:34.330
– of in this place, they say a lot of smuggling going on –

04:34.410 --> 04:39.601
and all such endeavors that people take up because they do not know

04:39.681 --> 04:42.240
what beautiful things they are.

04:42.320 --> 04:48.437
So now a mirror has to be created for them,
to see for themselves how beautiful they are.

04:48.518 --> 04:52.571
Their mirror is their Spirit.

04:52.651 --> 04:57.818
That Spirit is to be brought in their consciousness, their attention.

04:57.898 --> 05:03.227
If it comes in their attention then they can see their image.

05:03.320 --> 05:13.328
Now this attention that comes in as an enlightened attention

05:13.408 --> 05:19.380
is called in Sanskrit language as chidabhas

05:19.460 --> 05:25.342
is the expression of the attention which is enlightened.

05:25.422 --> 05:32.564
But it is also said that it is got a nature, which is very transitory,

05:32.644 --> 05:38.556
or, we can say, which is disappearing every moment to moment.

05:38.636 --> 05:42.661
When
this is happening what is to be done?

05:42.741 --> 05:48.796
For that you have to steady yourself with meditation,

05:48.876 --> 05:54.535
with hearing the enlightened talks,

05:54.615 --> 06:03.490
by seeing the good things of life without thinking about them,

06:03.570 --> 06:08.252
by seeing also the goodness of others

06:08.332 --> 06:12.534
and then you start seeing
goodness in yourself also.

06:12.614 --> 06:16.390
That is why I always say that one should not feel guilty.

06:16.470 --> 06:24.722
Because you are feeling guilty of something, which is just, just an illusion.

06:24.816 --> 06:29.747
You are guilty that you have got a shadow. It is something like that.

06:29.827 --> 06:33.422
So if you know that you are beautiful beings

06:33.502 --> 06:39.270
and that you have got a shadow is nothing to do with you and your beauty.

06:39.350 --> 06:45.879
If you can see you own beauty then you will be amazed that within us lies

06:45.960 --> 06:52.148
all those joy giving, all those beautiful
things, which we are seeing outside.

06:52.228 --> 06:54.828
But just now, the mirror is not all right,

06:54.908 --> 06:58.116
that’s
why you have to see in the nature the beauty.

06:58.197 --> 07:08.524
But, when you are one with your Self, then
you see all these nature within yourself,

07:08.605 --> 07:12.260
all the joy giving qualities of this nature within yourself.

07:12.340 --> 07:18.820
So I wanted you to come to this place just
to learn how God has created this beautiful

07:20.246 --> 07:25.427
area for you people to enjoy and to be here.

07:25.507 --> 07:27.640
May God bless you.
