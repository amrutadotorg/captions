1
00:00:00,049 --> 00:00:05,060
…and how it resides within us and how we
are lost in the curtains of Maya.

2
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:14,860
Today I am going to tell you how we get to
that Spirit.

3
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:30,791
There are two types of methods people employ
in finding out that Spirit.

4
00:00:30,791 --> 00:00:38,731
One is called as anuvopai, and another one
is called as shaktopai.

5
00:00:38,731 --> 00:00:43,291
‘Anu’ means a molecule.

6
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:59,151
When we are lost in the Maya, as I had told
you last time, actually the Spirit is eternal,

7
00:00:59,151 --> 00:01:01,421
It is all-powerful.

8
00:01:01,421 --> 00:01:09,760
It never loses Its power whether we are old,
young, whatever condition we may be, the Spirit

9
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,391
has Its own power, all the time.

10
00:01:14,391 --> 00:01:23,311
But, the reflection of the Spirit in us, the
light of the Spirit in us, depends on the

11
00:01:23,311 --> 00:01:28,811
quality of our reflector, how we are.

12
00:01:28,811 --> 00:01:37,510
And because of the quality being so poor sometimes,
darkness is created within us and in that

13
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:52,211
darkness, we do not know sometimes, even to
that extent, that there is something beyond.

14
00:01:52,211 --> 00:02:01,321
So the first style of seeking is anuvopai
as you call it, which is depending on separating

15
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:06,231
molecules after molecules.

16
00:02:06,231 --> 00:02:12,721
Because under these circumstances, when you
are surrounded by darkness, you see Spirit

17
00:02:12,721 --> 00:02:17,621
just as a molecule or you can say a spark
or a flicker.

18
00:02:17,621 --> 00:02:21,761
Sometimes you just get a flicker of it.

19
00:02:21,761 --> 00:02:25,451
As you know the thoughts arise within us and
fade away.

20
00:02:25,451 --> 00:02:29,851
We see the thoughts rising and fading away.

21
00:02:29,851 --> 00:02:32,821
And there are many thoughts all around us.

22
00:02:32,821 --> 00:02:38,841
Our attention is on those thoughts, moving
all the time.

23
00:02:38,841 --> 00:02:45,431
It is very hard to find that space in between
two thoughts, that’s why what we see is

24
00:02:45,431 --> 00:02:54,091
just a flicker, you can call it, or a little
atom of that Spirit, sometimes sparkling.

25
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:57,071
And then the search starts among human beings.

26
00:02:57,071 --> 00:03:05,311
From that darkness, from Tamoguna they start
searching and the kriya (action) starts within

27
00:03:05,311 --> 00:03:06,311
us.

28
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:18,321
So we can see in the left hand side as you
see the Ida Nadi, by which we live in Tamoguna,

29
00:03:18,321 --> 00:03:30,451
in desiring for it, and then we move to the
right hand side, on the Pingala Nadi, in which

30
00:03:30,451 --> 00:03:36,801
we act.

31
00:03:36,801 --> 00:03:42,121
In that action we try to find the Spirit.

32
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:54,481
Of course, first we think it is in getting
material advancement that you will find that

33
00:03:54,481 --> 00:04:02,581
Spirit, that flicker, and so we go in for
material advancement.

34
00:04:02,581 --> 00:04:12,251
Now, material advancement is very different
from the spiritual advancement.

35
00:04:12,251 --> 00:04:20,711
Or we can say the material happening, what
we see, like a plane landing or a plane taking

36
00:04:20,711 --> 00:04:33,320
off or a collision of two trains or any such
happenings are outside and spiritual happening

37
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:40,341
is within.

38
00:04:40,341 --> 00:04:47,871
Our attention is always attracted towards
outside happenings and it is an impossibility

39
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:56,271
to take this attention inside.

40
00:04:56,271 --> 00:05:05,771
That is why something has to happen within
us to attract that attention inside.

41
00:05:05,771 --> 00:05:18,051
We cannot force our attention inside, so people
try, normally, the anuvopai is that what you

42
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:29,140
call Ashtanga Yoga and other Yogas, by which
they try separating themselves from myth,

43
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:45,821
from darkness; for which you need very astute,
honest, sincere people, very young celibate,

44
00:05:45,821 --> 00:05:52,320
innocent people, those who have to live in
the forest with their Gurus.

45
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,970
So they keep out their attention, which is
called as nirodha (restraint).

46
00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:02,831
They stop their attention spreading itself.

47
00:06:02,831 --> 00:06:10,211
They concentrate their attention with the
help of a Realised soul.

48
00:06:10,211 --> 00:06:17,401
If you come to India you’ll meet some real
sages like that who live on top of hills and

49
00:06:17,401 --> 00:06:20,591
mountains, who are not easily available to
people.

50
00:06:20,591 --> 00:06:27,281
They do not sell their religion or they do
not sell their Realisation to people.

51
00:06:27,281 --> 00:06:30,890
Hidden away from the madding crowd, they exist
there.

52
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:38,530
One of them has told someone, some Sahaja
Yogis that he has practiced anuvopai for twenty-one

53
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:45,470
thousand years from when he was just a frog!

54
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:52,320
It’s fantastic that he carried on for twenty-one
thousand years, every year, life, he was born

55
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:57,662
and still he cannot raise the Kundalini of
others very easily!

56
00:06:57,662 --> 00:07:06,590
Still he does not have the power to raise
the Kundalini the way you Sahaja Yogis can

57
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:07,590
raise!

58
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:09,560
It’s most surprising!

59
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:14,480
He has given Realisation to only one person,
only one.

60
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:18,161
In twenty five years he worked on him; the
same way, anuvopai.

61
00:07:18,161 --> 00:07:20,810
These are the people who are detached, veetragas.

62
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:29,390
Not that you have to run way from anywhere,
but living in the society only you can achieve

63
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:34,420
it through our Sahaja Yoga or Mahayoga.

64
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:35,880
This is shaktopai.

65
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:44,910
But these people still are afraid to come
in the cities because they could not make

66
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:51,720
people understand.

67
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:59,321
They do not trust human beings and they want
to keep away from them.

68
00:07:59,321 --> 00:08:00,321
They are not married.

69
00:08:00,321 --> 00:08:01,611
They lead a celibate life.

70
00:08:01,611 --> 00:08:05,920
They live up to two hundred years sometimes,
sometimes a thousand years also.

71
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:15,091
But it is a very individualistic movement,
works on one or two people.

72
00:08:15,091 --> 00:08:17,311
Births after births they cleansed themselves.

73
00:08:17,311 --> 00:08:20,040
This is anuvopai.

74
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:26,361
So the search for the Divine or for the Spirit
has been on for ages now, it’s not a new

75
00:08:26,361 --> 00:08:29,910
thing that we are doing here.

76
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:38,541
And you also have been seeking that Divine
in your previous lives and many lives before.

77
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:44,041
But you must know that for seeking you have
to go inside.

78
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:45,861
It’s not outside.

79
00:08:45,861 --> 00:08:51,431
And how do you go inside?

80
00:08:51,431 --> 00:08:54,221
Is the problem.

81
00:08:54,221 --> 00:08:57,071
Some people say that if you go on suggesting,
“I’m going inside,” you go inside.

82
00:08:57,071 --> 00:09:10,140
It’s all imagination, because when the attention
is out, the knower and the knowledge, both

83
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,991
are different.

84
00:09:11,991 --> 00:09:15,001
Like if I see this thing now, for example,
if I am not a Realised soul, I’ll see this

85
00:09:15,001 --> 00:09:20,791
one and I will just think, “How much they
must have paid for it?

86
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:23,121
What is it made of?

87
00:09:23,121 --> 00:09:24,131
From where did they get it?”

88
00:09:24,131 --> 00:09:27,270
All sorts of these superficial things as you
can call it.

89
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:31,280
At the most somebody might say, “It’s
very aesthetically placed and it has very

90
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,261
great balance,” and all that.

91
00:09:33,261 --> 00:09:34,481
At the most!

92
00:09:34,481 --> 00:09:44,121
But it is all outside, because the knower
who knows about it is outside the knowledge.

93
00:09:44,121 --> 00:09:57,780
So there’s a tremendous difference between
the happening outside and happening inside.

94
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:03,280
When you see a train colliding you will say,
“Oh, look at this!

95
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,881
What is this they have done?

96
00:10:04,881 --> 00:10:09,981
This driver is wrong!” and that, “These
people have suffered so much,” and all sorts

97
00:10:09,981 --> 00:10:10,981
of things.

98
00:10:10,981 --> 00:10:11,981
You’ll start collecting money.

99
00:10:11,981 --> 00:10:14,871
Whatever we do normally, you see.

100
00:10:14,871 --> 00:10:24,431
But the knowledge about it is outside the
knower that is your Self.

101
00:10:24,431 --> 00:10:35,111
But when the spiritual happening takes place
the knowledge and the knower become one.

102
00:10:35,111 --> 00:10:46,561
For example now this machine that is here,
to a normal person as I told you will be,

103
00:10:46,561 --> 00:10:48,820
“It is so much, it costs so much,” or
whatever it is, you see.

104
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:53,890
But to a Realised soul it would be, “Is
it vibrating?

105
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:56,211
Is it emitting vibrations?

106
00:10:56,211 --> 00:10:59,501
What sort of vibrations is it emitting?

107
00:10:59,501 --> 00:11:02,161
It is good or bad?”

108
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:08,241
Because then you start understanding it according
to spiritual value and not according to material

109
00:11:08,241 --> 00:11:09,551
value.

110
00:11:09,551 --> 00:11:11,761
I hope you understand this point.

111
00:11:11,761 --> 00:11:15,571
Spiritual value is an absolute value.

112
00:11:15,571 --> 00:11:24,131
And what is the measure of that is the spiritual
joy.

113
00:11:24,131 --> 00:11:30,640
The vibrations give you spiritual joy – the
good vibrations, I mean.

114
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,971
What are good vibrations?

115
00:11:31,971 --> 00:11:38,901
Are nothing but the coefficience (sic) of
this whole thing is emitting through it, the

116
00:11:38,901 --> 00:11:45,011
All Pervading Power, which is giving you joy.

117
00:11:45,011 --> 00:11:47,981
It is an absolute value.

118
00:11:47,981 --> 00:11:54,971
You take ten children who are Realised souls:
you tie their eyes and ask them to put their

119
00:11:54,971 --> 00:11:56,320
hands towards one person.

120
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:03,001
All of them will show you the same finger,
which is burning; whichever is the chakra

121
00:12:03,001 --> 00:12:05,221
they are catching.

122
00:12:05,221 --> 00:12:10,566
There will be no confusion, no second opinion
about it, no quarrelling, because that’s

123
00:12:10,566 --> 00:12:21,460
what it is, because the knower and the knowledge
is the same.

124
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:27,711
That is why when our attention is outside
and we are seeking something or knowing something,

125
00:12:27,711 --> 00:12:37,780
then we start seeing it according to our thinking
and who does the thinking is Mr. Ego or maybe

126
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:38,780
Superego.

127
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:47,020
We are not there to think about it, so anything
you give them, say for example you marry two

128
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:51,861
persons in modern times.

129
00:12:51,861 --> 00:12:55,411
So they’ll sit down and work it out.

130
00:12:55,411 --> 00:12:59,601
How can you work out a marriage with your
brains?

131
00:12:59,601 --> 00:13:00,741
It’s a question of your heart.

132
00:13:00,741 --> 00:13:01,741
Just enjoy it.

133
00:13:01,741 --> 00:13:06,210
You give them food, they’ll sit down and
work it out, start analysing it.

134
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:10,020
They cannot synthesise it.

135
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:14,411
The food will get cold, it will lose all its
taste and the whole thing will be wasted.

136
00:13:14,411 --> 00:13:16,890
They make the same thing out of their lives.

137
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:20,971
For nothing at all they create problems by
thinking.

138
00:13:20,971 --> 00:13:29,101
Analysis starts outside, synthesis starts
inside.

139
00:13:29,101 --> 00:13:36,351
Now this nirodha is the withdrawing of your
attention inside as I told you is only possible

140
00:13:36,351 --> 00:13:37,541
through a happening within.

141
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:42,030
Now how do you get the happening within yourself?

142
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:47,520
For example, I am talking to you, you are
paying attention to Me: supposing something

143
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:50,991
falls down, immediately your attention goes
to that happening.

144
00:13:50,991 --> 00:13:53,481
So there has to be some happening within.

145
00:13:53,481 --> 00:14:01,561
Now, what is that happening, is Kundalini
Yoga, and this Kundalini Yoga is the shaktopai,

146
00:14:01,561 --> 00:14:07,641
is the, is known as shaktipath, is the giving
of the Shakti.

147
00:14:07,641 --> 00:14:13,510
Very few are entitled with this, I mean today
these are all selling ‘shaktis’ there.

148
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:19,361
There have their ashramas, and this that,
they are talking of shakti, when that people

149
00:14:19,361 --> 00:14:23,491
start dancing, jumping, screaming like possessed
people.

150
00:14:23,491 --> 00:14:26,400
That is not Shakti at all.

151
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:37,320
Only a person of a very high quality can raise
the Kundalini because he is to be authorised

152
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,330
by God.

153
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:49,381
It’s a very rare thing to give Realisation
to people.

154
00:14:49,381 --> 00:14:58,551
Only such people who have been authorised
by God can just move the Kundalini straight

155
00:14:58,551 --> 00:14:59,971
forward.

156
00:14:59,971 --> 00:15:12,331
So the anuvopai is a very slow action, is
for few individuals who get out of this maya,

157
00:15:12,331 --> 00:15:19,440
this illusion and tell people that, “This
is all illusion, is a mirage, you are running

158
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,440
after a mirage.

159
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:23,150
Don’t run after this mirage.”

160
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:27,111
But still, people can’t believe them.

161
00:15:27,111 --> 00:15:32,291
They crucify them, they poison them, they
beat them, they do all kinds of things to

162
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:33,330
them.

163
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:39,231
I mean, they did not do any harm to anyone
whatsoever that they should be treated so

164
00:15:39,231 --> 00:15:45,580
badly by human beings.

165
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:56,821
So, it is to be understood that your attention
has to be sucked in.

166
00:15:56,821 --> 00:16:03,181
The nirodha has to work out.

167
00:16:03,181 --> 00:16:06,080
Not by denying things, “Don’t look at
the women.”

168
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,241
“Don’t look at the gold.”

169
00:16:08,241 --> 00:16:11,311
“Don’t look at things, your attention
will be spoiled.”

170
00:16:11,311 --> 00:16:12,541
Not by those methods.

171
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:18,570
Or by taking you to the jungles, leading you
a celibate life, making a very holy atmosphere

172
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:25,701
around and just forcing you that you do not
see that [which] is evil.

173
00:16:25,701 --> 00:16:32,491
But when you see it again you go back to the
same!

174
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:35,840
There’s no immunity developed.

175
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:44,991
So the attention when it’s sucked in by
Kundalini rising, the first thing you notice

176
00:16:44,991 --> 00:16:48,530
is that there is dilatation of the pupil.

177
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:54,450
Now, dilatation of the pupil will cause a
kind of a blindness, normally.

178
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:59,680
There was a lady doctor who had come for her
Realisation to me once and I tried to raise

179
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,771
her Kundalini, it wouldn’t go beyond Agya.

180
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:08,090
While she was driving suddenly she felt that
her eyes were dilating and she couldn’t

181
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:14,631
see, so she took her car on one side and she
said , “For about a minute I just could

182
00:17:14,631 --> 00:17:16,611
not see anything, I was quite worried.

183
00:17:16,611 --> 00:17:20,471
I felt my dilatation of the pupil is taking
place and I was worried about it that how

184
00:17:20,471 --> 00:17:21,471
I’ve become blind.”

185
00:17:21,471 --> 00:17:27,681
And then again she got back but when she went
back, she was seeing much better and there

186
00:17:27,681 --> 00:17:32,011
was a sparkle in her eyes, eyes were sparkling.

187
00:17:32,011 --> 00:17:34,711
She telephoned to me, she said , “Does it
happen?”

188
00:17:34,711 --> 00:17:36,091
I said , “Yes.”

189
00:17:36,091 --> 00:17:44,261
To attract your attention from outside inward,
Kundalini does that to you, that She dilates

190
00:17:44,261 --> 00:17:46,081
your pupil.

191
00:17:46,081 --> 00:17:52,881
Now the doctors may come on my head and say
that it is a parasympathetic or a sympathetic

192
00:17:52,881 --> 00:17:53,881
action.

193
00:17:53,881 --> 00:17:54,881
They do not know, they have not yet decided.

194
00:17:54,881 --> 00:17:57,591
It’s the action of Kundalini.

195
00:17:57,591 --> 00:18:01,810
They don’t know about Kundalini.

196
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:04,030
Even if you show them pulsating they will
not believe it.

197
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:05,560
They don’t want to believe it.

198
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,751
They want to remain outside, in ignorance.

199
00:18:07,751 --> 00:18:11,081
All of them are like that.

200
00:18:11,081 --> 00:18:16,791
Now, everybody is saying that now outside
battles are over, we have to have battle inside,

201
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:19,351
we have to fight ourselves.

202
00:18:19,351 --> 00:18:25,521
Anywhere you go they will say that, “We
must find our wholesomeness.”

203
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:27,910
Oh, big lectures you know!

204
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:30,670
Conferences after conferences people are talking
so big!

205
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:33,290
Talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk.

206
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:39,741
But when it comes to reality that you can
have it, it’s a very slow movement [but]

207
00:18:39,741 --> 00:18:41,071
still better than anuvopai!

208
00:18:41,071 --> 00:18:51,471
By anuvopai [those] who are living in the
city they will not reach anywhere, they cannot.

209
00:18:51,471 --> 00:18:55,751
If you try to do all those things, if you
do not have a Realised soul as your guru and

210
00:18:55,751 --> 00:19:02,101
also the atmosphere, either you’ll get into
ego or into superego; you’ll have a problem

211
00:19:02,101 --> 00:19:11,261
there, either onto to the left or onto the
right.

212
00:19:11,261 --> 00:19:14,491
Supposing you tell them , “Now, don’t
drink, don’t smoke!”

213
00:19:14,491 --> 00:19:17,971
Immediately you will get conditioned and Mr.
Freud will stand up and say, “See, you are

214
00:19:17,971 --> 00:19:19,290
conditioned, you should have all the freedom!”

215
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:20,290
Alright.

216
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:23,231
So you go ahead [and] do whatever you please.

217
00:19:23,231 --> 00:19:29,660
So your Mr. Ego will become like a big balloon
on your head if you do whatever you please.

218
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:34,041
And then you have a big forehead coming out,
eating everyone out like that.

219
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:40,310
(laughing) And I have given a nice speech
on Mr. Ego, how it tries to strangle everyone

220
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:42,071
and how we are raising against everyone.

221
00:19:42,071 --> 00:19:49,540
This Mr. Ego gives us the feeling that we
are something and that is the one which keeps

222
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:52,511
us in bondage of ignorance.

223
00:19:52,511 --> 00:19:58,481
And it’s like, I sometimes feel, like the
fist of a boxer!

224
00:19:58,481 --> 00:20:02,991
Anybody tries to go near it, it gives you
a bang back!

225
00:20:02,991 --> 00:20:07,141
Anybody tries to say anything about it, it
will come out with a big bang on your head.

226
00:20:07,141 --> 00:20:13,331
So if you do not pay attention to your ego
and say, “No, no, no, no, I must not eat

227
00:20:13,331 --> 00:20:15,991
this, I must not do this, I must not do that,”
finished!

228
00:20:15,991 --> 00:20:19,761
You go onto the left hand side and then you
get the conditioning and then you may fall

229
00:20:19,761 --> 00:20:23,821
into the traps of Mr. Rajneesh or someone
like that, who is conditioning you.

230
00:20:23,821 --> 00:20:26,371
And you cannot get out of it.

231
00:20:26,371 --> 00:20:34,211
You try your level best, you cannot get out
of it, because they entrap you with their

232
00:20:34,211 --> 00:20:38,800
hypnosis, you go into your superego, you are
hypnotised, you are possessed and whatever

233
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:43,771
you may try, all such people are very difficult
for Sahaja Yoga.

234
00:20:43,771 --> 00:20:51,430
They think I don’t know what they are doing,
but it is not my knowing, it is your knowing

235
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:52,430
is the point.

236
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:55,660
The loser is within you, and the winner is
also within you.

237
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:59,231
It is you [who] have to gain, not me.

238
00:20:59,231 --> 00:21:02,991
Sahaja Yoga is not for me at all.

239
00:21:02,991 --> 00:21:05,341
I don’t have to do it.

240
00:21:05,341 --> 00:21:13,160
It is for you to do it to gain that knowledge
which is your Self.

241
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:21,060
Only thing I can do is the Shakti path but
actually I don’t do it either, I can tell

242
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:22,060
you.

243
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:23,060
I don’t do anything.

244
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,060
I’m just sitting quiet.

245
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:26,300
It just emits, what can I do?

246
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:29,871
That’s my nature, it just flows.

247
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:32,800
It works out that way.

248
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:37,841
But, because of our ego, we want all challenges.

249
00:21:37,841 --> 00:21:46,650
Supposing I tell you tomorrow that, “You
can only get it by jumping hundred times,”

250
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:47,731
you will immediately start doing that!

251
00:21:47,731 --> 00:21:57,900
If I tell you, say, on another sort of a efficiency
trip, that, “Supposing you do a hundred

252
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:04,871
jumps in five minutes, you will get it faster,”
you will do that.

253
00:22:04,871 --> 00:22:13,141
Or else I give you another kind of a pralobhan
(प्रलोभन) as they call it, a

254
00:22:13,141 --> 00:22:14,141
temptation.

255
00:22:14,141 --> 00:22:20,310
Like you put five rupees today then I say,
“No, no, you better put ten rupees,” and

256
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:21,310
you put that.

257
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:24,951
It’s like a running a horse, race.

258
00:22:24,951 --> 00:22:31,001
See how superficially we look at this.

259
00:22:31,001 --> 00:22:34,930
In this superficiality we are going to get
lost completely.

260
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:41,641
If you are really seeking then you find it
and be there and get it!

261
00:22:41,641 --> 00:22:46,321
This is your own!

262
00:22:46,321 --> 00:22:50,711
We talk big; I find very – I mean I meet
the people who are the cream of every nation,

263
00:22:50,711 --> 00:22:58,111
I should say, and they are creaming each other,
that’s all!

264
00:22:58,111 --> 00:23:01,801
Nothing more than that.

265
00:23:01,801 --> 00:23:06,410
They do not want to go deeper into it and
talking about, “Oh, we understand.

266
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:08,031
There has to be a Messiah.

267
00:23:08,031 --> 00:23:10,891
There has to be [that] something must happen
to us.”

268
00:23:10,891 --> 00:23:12,581
“We should all become wholesome.”

269
00:23:12,581 --> 00:23:16,861
Now they are finding fanaticism is troubling
them so they are saying, “No, these fanatics

270
00:23:16,861 --> 00:23:18,400
are there.”

271
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,461
And we are all fanatics when we are outside.

272
00:23:21,461 --> 00:23:29,790
I mean, if you ask me, they look like mad
people to me.

273
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:31,560
Such extremists!

274
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:35,101
All [their] attention outside.

275
00:23:35,101 --> 00:23:39,150
And an arrangement has been made within you,
as I told you, of Kundalini being placed at

276
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:40,560
the triangular bone there.

277
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:46,191
It’s so beautiful it is constructed, just
see the beauty of the Kundalini.

278
00:23:46,191 --> 00:23:50,941
Even in seeking we have gone all out to torture
our Kundalini.

279
00:23:50,941 --> 00:23:59,310
We are not honest to ourselves and to our
Mother, the Kundalini, the One who is sitting

280
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:05,941
there for us to give us our Realisation, our
re-birth.

281
00:24:05,941 --> 00:24:10,851
She is there, you can see for yourself with
your naked eyes.

282
00:24:10,851 --> 00:24:14,601
For example, one of the Sahaja Yogis who is
a doctor went and talked to the doctors.

283
00:24:14,601 --> 00:24:15,920
I said, “Now, what are they doing?”

284
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:20,891
They said, “Yes, we know, we got the cool
breeze in the hand, alright.”

285
00:24:20,891 --> 00:24:21,891
“Then?”

286
00:24:21,891 --> 00:24:26,241
“And yes we see, we know there is something
pulsating in the triangular bone.”

287
00:24:26,241 --> 00:24:27,241
“Then?

288
00:24:27,241 --> 00:24:30,861
Does not intrigue you?”

289
00:24:30,861 --> 00:24:38,251
“But still, how can that be Self Realisation?”

290
00:24:38,251 --> 00:24:53,221
I mean, it is beyond any one to drink water
for others and digest it and enjoy it.

291
00:24:53,221 --> 00:25:01,241
You can take somebody to the water, make them
drink, push them down into it, but if they

292
00:25:01,241 --> 00:25:05,560
just refuse then what can you do about it?

293
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:10,881
And then they will come out of it and have
a big conference: “It’s a big conference.

294
00:25:10,881 --> 00:25:12,151
Having, a big, big conferences!”

295
00:25:12,151 --> 00:25:13,151
Halls they’ll fill up!

296
00:25:13,151 --> 00:25:14,461
And what are they discussing?

297
00:25:14,461 --> 00:25:21,941
How to know that you are a part of the one
living organism!

298
00:25:21,941 --> 00:25:28,391
Again you take out some books, read here,
have a big discussion, have a big party out

299
00:25:28,391 --> 00:25:30,661
of that and finished.

300
00:25:30,661 --> 00:25:39,050
This ‘Sunday School’ seeking, is not going
to help us.

301
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:47,310
First thing we have to be genuine about it
that we want to seek it.

302
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:58,650
As you know in Sahaja Yoga, those who have
advanced, those who have really worked genuinely,

303
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:14,651
without paying attention outside, have been
able to know the Divine, to enjoy It and to

304
00:26:14,651 --> 00:26:16,170
give It to others.

305
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:25,631
But anywhere in life you see, without genuineness,
what are you going to achieve?

306
00:26:25,631 --> 00:26:29,971
It’s like some mad man who’s a Liaison
Officer, you see.

307
00:26:29,971 --> 00:26:31,471
Imagine what a job and a half!

308
00:26:31,471 --> 00:26:35,821
He’s a Liaison Officer, so he is running
with the flowers for one person, another for

309
00:26:35,821 --> 00:26:37,381
another person, he doesn’t know who is coming.

310
00:26:37,381 --> 00:26:41,761
He may give flowers to somebody else, all
sorts of madness.

311
00:26:41,761 --> 00:26:47,131
In the same way, we are like Liaison Officers,
without any feelings within our heart.

312
00:26:47,131 --> 00:26:53,280
But with this happening you start feeling
the other within you.

313
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,381
You start feeling.

314
00:26:54,381 --> 00:26:58,060
It’s an actualisation, as I told you last
time.

315
00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:04,160
And when that actualisation takes place the
only thing you have to do, is to allow it

316
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:11,300
to grow, because it has happened spontaneously
without your effort being put into it and

317
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:13,481
it is going to work out spontaneously.

318
00:27:13,481 --> 00:27:21,140
Only don’t stop its progress by your own
ego and your own style of looking at things.

319
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:29,040
You cannot make a career out of it or a business.

320
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,181
It is to be enjoyed!

321
00:27:31,181 --> 00:27:35,761
Now I am surprised how human beings are not
selling their children.

322
00:27:35,761 --> 00:27:38,401
I mean they are selling everything.

323
00:27:38,401 --> 00:27:47,571
They are selling their hair, nose, eyes, everything
that is possible under the sun, blood.

324
00:27:47,571 --> 00:28:00,731
But the source of all the joy that is within
you is in the heart pulsating.

325
00:28:00,731 --> 00:28:06,701
That is called as the pranashakti, is the
pulsating power of the Spirit within you,

326
00:28:06,701 --> 00:28:13,991
which is just to be enlightened so [that]
the whole attention gets enlightened.

327
00:28:13,991 --> 00:28:20,930
And the difference between an ordinary awareness,
where the knower and the knowledge are two

328
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:28,060
different things and an enlightened awareness,
where both become one, it is tremendous!

329
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:34,941
But nobody wants to practice it and see for
yourself how dynamic it is!

330
00:28:34,941 --> 00:28:42,531
This is what the whole world is seeking today,
this is what we are talking about and that

331
00:28:42,531 --> 00:28:50,601
is how the supply department from India for
all the kinds of thugs are coming here!

332
00:28:50,601 --> 00:28:57,091
So it’s a big circus going on everywhere!

333
00:28:57,091 --> 00:29:03,300
Do you want to also run in the same circus?

334
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:07,671
I mean, it is not to please me, sir, but is
to please your Self.

335
00:29:07,671 --> 00:29:13,800
Because it is only the spiritual value of
everything whatsoever is going to give you

336
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:16,680
joy, nothing else.

337
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:21,501
Let the awakening take place.

338
00:29:21,501 --> 00:29:26,321
Give some time to it.

339
00:29:26,321 --> 00:29:28,851
You have problems, the Kundalini rises, alright.

340
00:29:28,851 --> 00:29:32,520
It touches the Sahastrara, that’s also correct.

341
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:36,351
But many people they say, “Mother, when
it has touched, why should it fall?”

342
00:29:36,351 --> 00:29:38,170
Now, it’s not my fault.

343
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:40,170
Mine does not fall.

344
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:46,231
It falls because of your faults, whatever
you have done to yourself.

345
00:29:46,231 --> 00:29:49,280
The Kundalini has to supply, she has to look
after you.

346
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:53,670
You have been so cruel to yourself or to others,
whatever you have done.

347
00:29:53,670 --> 00:29:57,481
You have done all wrong things so far, so
Kundalini falls.

348
00:29:57,481 --> 00:30:00,761
Let Her look after all these things.

349
00:30:00,761 --> 00:30:04,821
She knows you have a problem.

350
00:30:04,821 --> 00:30:09,810
But if you are not genuine, she knows also
that you are not genuine.

351
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:16,601
She’ll just disappear into your Mooladhara
there in the triangular bone and will never

352
00:30:16,601 --> 00:30:17,601
rise.

353
00:30:17,601 --> 00:30:20,031
She’ll be very badly frozen.

354
00:30:20,031 --> 00:30:26,780
When you start thinking about the Kundalini,
you just close her completely there and she

355
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:27,780
just goes down.

356
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:29,761
She sees, “This man doesn’t know anything.

357
00:30:29,761 --> 00:30:36,511
He’ll have to take another ten births perhaps
to get his Kundalini again back in place.”

358
00:30:36,511 --> 00:30:43,221
But with some people it comes up and stays
there.

359
00:30:43,221 --> 00:30:46,051
You must respect it.

360
00:30:46,051 --> 00:30:47,831
You must value it.

361
00:30:47,831 --> 00:30:54,581
If you value that, you have valued yourself
and nobody else.

362
00:30:54,581 --> 00:31:02,701
By crucifying Christ, you cannot reduce his
value by any chance.

363
00:31:02,701 --> 00:31:08,420
You have crucified yourself by that, when
you crucified you.

364
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:13,731
So the good time is coming, Christmas ahead.

365
00:31:13,731 --> 00:31:19,441
Let Christ be born within us on our Agya here
in the crossing point.

366
00:31:19,441 --> 00:31:31,020
Let us remember all these great incarnations
and prophets who came on this earth, who lived

367
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:38,921
like us, like ordinary human beings, in the
most ordinary way.

368
00:31:38,921 --> 00:31:41,040
They led a very ordinary simple life.

369
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:43,530
Some of them married also, had children.

370
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:44,530
Why?

371
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:56,941
They could have lived on the hills and mountains
very easily avoiding all the nonsense.

372
00:31:56,941 --> 00:32:09,821
No, they did come to give you a milestone
in your achievement of your evolution, and

373
00:32:09,821 --> 00:32:18,351
this is what is the evolution, the Maha Yoga,
where you become one with the Spirit.

374
00:32:18,351 --> 00:32:26,141
All the rest is useless, of no value.

375
00:32:26,141 --> 00:32:32,581
Spirit is your Self, is you.

376
00:32:32,581 --> 00:32:40,451
You are identified with your ego, so you want
to always satisfy your ego, “I like it.”

377
00:32:40,451 --> 00:32:48,651
“I like it,” means Mr. Ego likes it, really,
most of the time.

378
00:32:48,651 --> 00:32:52,691
And the Self doesn’t say , “I like it.”

379
00:32:52,691 --> 00:32:55,280
It feels it.

380
00:32:55,280 --> 00:33:00,121
It feels within Itself.

381
00:33:00,121 --> 00:33:02,540
It’s absolute.

382
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:07,900
This is the shaktopai, which many people are
practicing.

383
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:12,071
I haven’t come across even one genuine person
who does this, so far.

384
00:33:12,071 --> 00:33:17,121
I mean we had: Nanaka was there, Kabira was
there, we had in India – great people.

385
00:33:17,121 --> 00:33:25,081
And they have talked about these fake people.

386
00:33:25,081 --> 00:33:32,660
Even in the anuvopai, also Kundalini has to
rise in any case!

387
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:35,241
It has happened in the case of Buddha and
Mahavira.

388
00:33:35,241 --> 00:33:41,300
But I told you that they were the children
of Rama and thousands of years later, they

389
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:48,041
got their Realisation, and they are like incarnations
only, you can say, but they are different

390
00:33:48,041 --> 00:33:49,041
styles.

391
00:33:49,041 --> 00:33:53,141
We have no time to waste now.

392
00:33:53,141 --> 00:34:01,051
This is the Last Judgment where we have to
give up all our nonsensical ideas.

393
00:34:01,051 --> 00:34:09,640
You see, it’s difficult to talk to people
who have made business out of God, or some

394
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:17,191
sort of a political issue out of a God.

395
00:34:17,191 --> 00:34:21,752
But sensible people should know that they
have to know themselves first of all, they

396
00:34:21,752 --> 00:34:29,061
have to become themselves and then they will
know that they are really a part and parcel

397
00:34:29,061 --> 00:34:37,231
of the whole, of the Viraat, the Akbar.

398
00:34:37,231 --> 00:34:42,831
You cannot know religion from outside like
these people are saying, “Allah ho Akbar,

399
00:34:42,831 --> 00:34:46,241
Allah ho Akbar,” and killing you!

400
00:34:46,241 --> 00:34:51,370
Or sitting in the Church and, “Let’s us
sing hymn number such and such.”

401
00:34:51,370 --> 00:34:58,781
Or in our temples selling all kinds of drugs.

402
00:34:58,781 --> 00:35:09,871
That’s why this contrast one doesn’t understand
how religious people could be like that.

403
00:35:09,871 --> 00:35:18,771
And then you get some nice people, ‘gentlemen’,
you know, ‘very good people’.

404
00:35:18,771 --> 00:35:19,851
Useless!

405
00:35:19,851 --> 00:35:24,603
“Oh, they are very good,” alright, what
will they do?

406
00:35:24,603 --> 00:35:33,631
They’ll make some bridges or may have some
tunnels or may do some creative work of writing

407
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:36,741
some novels or something.

408
00:35:36,741 --> 00:35:41,921
But still the knower and the knowledge is
separated in them.

409
00:35:41,921 --> 00:35:48,840
They are useless to themselves, I am saying,
not to others.

410
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:53,491
And the confusion has to go by achieving your
absolute.

411
00:35:53,491 --> 00:35:58,021
But all the time our attention is outside
criticising others or finding faults with

412
00:35:58,021 --> 00:36:02,251
others or some sort of a trivial thing.

413
00:36:02,251 --> 00:36:11,881
All this sounds so trivial in this world,
the way we are wasting our energy.

414
00:36:11,881 --> 00:36:25,360
Here is the store within us of our own earnings,
of our own punyas by which you have to get

415
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:36,340
that [which] is promised to you and to enjoy
that and here is the key for you!

416
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:44,021
Keep your minds open and take in, have it,
it’s a gift.

417
00:36:44,021 --> 00:36:48,870
As you yourself know that – you have got
so many gifts from God.

418
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:52,801
How is it you have become a human being?

419
00:36:52,801 --> 00:36:54,571
What have you done to become a human being?

420
00:36:54,571 --> 00:37:04,161
This is a gift of God, this beautiful human
body, mind, everything you have got it.

421
00:37:04,161 --> 00:37:15,610
And now that gift itself is going to transform
you into the greatest of greatest gift – is

422
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:18,541
to know your Father.

423
00:37:18,541 --> 00:37:26,691
The One who has created you is anxious to
bestow all His powers to you, like a father

424
00:37:26,691 --> 00:37:28,101
wants to bestow all his property.

425
00:37:28,101 --> 00:37:36,201
So take it with both the hands and have it,
and enjoy it.

426
00:37:36,201 --> 00:37:44,511
Before Realisation, I do not tell you that
you give up drinking, smoking or any kind

427
00:37:44,511 --> 00:37:45,511
of nirodh.

428
00:37:45,511 --> 00:37:50,580
No, I cannot ask you to do that.

429
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:58,330
But after Realisation, jolly well you give
it up, you just do it, because you now taste

430
00:37:58,330 --> 00:38:01,641
the ambrosia, the amruta.

431
00:38:01,641 --> 00:38:05,080
Then you don’t want to have anything else.

432
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:13,151
But, till you have tasted it, give some time,
have some patience.

433
00:38:13,151 --> 00:38:17,061
You need not be very well educated for this.

434
00:38:17,061 --> 00:38:22,461
You need not have a very good practice of
say, standing on your heads!

435
00:38:22,461 --> 00:38:27,421
You need not be going to churches or anything.

436
00:38:27,421 --> 00:38:30,501
If you are a normal human being, it is going
to work out.

437
00:38:30,501 --> 00:38:35,621
But mostly, when we do all these things, we
are abnormal.

438
00:38:35,621 --> 00:38:41,161
Even in saying that we are seeking God, we
are doing lots of abnormal things.

439
00:38:41,161 --> 00:38:43,411
We have to be absolutely normal.

440
00:38:43,411 --> 00:38:47,820
It is like this room being dark, you are sitting
down here, now sit down!

441
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:49,201
It’s going to work out.

442
00:38:49,201 --> 00:38:52,241
But we start jumping here and there and we
get hurt.

443
00:38:52,241 --> 00:39:01,921
It’s like going in a boat: just keep quiet,
just be in the centre, with the centre of

444
00:39:01,921 --> 00:39:03,251
gravity of the boat.

445
00:39:03,251 --> 00:39:04,671
Just be there!

446
00:39:04,671 --> 00:39:07,321
That is dharma.

447
00:39:07,321 --> 00:39:13,971
In your sustenance, stay there.

448
00:39:13,971 --> 00:39:17,951
I mean to remain good, you don’t have to
do anything.

449
00:39:17,951 --> 00:39:25,921
I mean to become bad, you have to do something,
isn’t it?

450
00:39:25,921 --> 00:39:35,580
All these things will come to you automatically
when there is light.

451
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:36,610
Just be quiet.

452
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:42,781
All of you are going to get it.

453
00:39:42,781 --> 00:39:49,311
That is being ordained, that’s being arranged,
organised, very well within you, beautifully.

454
00:39:49,311 --> 00:39:58,321
As in a seed everything is arranged, to create
a tree, it’s arranged within you.

455
00:39:58,321 --> 00:40:12,921
But you have to be together, work it out,
understand each other and this group grows

456
00:40:12,921 --> 00:40:29,370
in that understanding, in collectivity, and
creates a nucleus for others to follow it.

457
00:40:29,370 --> 00:40:43,471
So, there should be no problem for you to
understand that it is a special grace.

458
00:40:43,471 --> 00:40:53,081
Because you are special, maybe I am also special,
and special people needed somebody special,

459
00:40:53,081 --> 00:40:55,100
so I had to come down here!

460
00:40:55,100 --> 00:41:02,501
Let’s have it in a mutual admiration way,
will be a good idea.

461
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:08,411
There is no need to feel obliged because I
have to do it.

462
00:41:08,411 --> 00:41:18,491
I feel loaded with it and I feel lighter when
you get it.

463
00:41:18,491 --> 00:41:25,031
Like a mother I tell you.

464
00:41:25,031 --> 00:41:28,060
Sometimes I have to be stern.

465
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:33,021
I know the job of a mother.

466
00:41:33,021 --> 00:41:38,001
You need not be afraid of me at all.

467
00:41:38,001 --> 00:41:43,151
I know everything about you, somehow.

468
00:41:43,151 --> 00:41:48,291
Like we had one Douglas (Fry) with us and
I suddenly asked him, “What about your birthday?”

469
00:41:48,291 --> 00:41:49,330
He was taken aback!

470
00:41:49,330 --> 00:41:53,810
He didn’t know – he’s sitting here – how
I knew that his birthday was there.

471
00:41:53,810 --> 00:41:57,161
And he really had a rebirth from the life
he had.

472
00:41:57,161 --> 00:42:00,141
And when I said, he said , “How do You know,
Mother?”

473
00:42:00,141 --> 00:42:01,791
I said , “I know what about your birthday.”

474
00:42:01,791 --> 00:42:04,851
And I went to his house and saw him.

475
00:42:04,851 --> 00:42:11,451
[I was] so overjoyed to see him settled down.

476
00:42:11,451 --> 00:42:20,651
It is amazing how your seed grows and how
fragrant you become.

477
00:42:20,651 --> 00:42:24,881
May God bless you all.

478
00:42:24,881 --> 00:42:34,381
If you have any questions, please ask me.

479
00:42:34,381 --> 00:42:49,080
We have little time.

480
00:42:49,080 --> 00:43:04,031
There are eighty-four tapes already with these
people and, if you want to have tapes for

481
00:43:04,031 --> 00:43:23,340
yourself, you can give them the tapes and
they can tape for you or perhaps…

482
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:52,961
Those who do not feel vibration should not
get upset.

483
00:43:52,961 --> 00:43:54,320
There’s something wrong somewhere.

484
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:58,671
I may not tell you on your face, because I
don’t want to hurt you in any way.

485
00:43:58,671 --> 00:44:02,831
But doesn’t matter, I am going to work it
out, you see, doctor doesn’t come and tell

486
00:44:02,831 --> 00:44:09,221
you that, “You have got all these diseases
and you may die next moment.”

487
00:44:09,221 --> 00:44:12,091
If doctor can do that, I am after all your
Mother, so I am not going to tell you.

488
00:44:12,091 --> 00:44:20,161
You yourself will know, later on, what was
wrong with you.

489
00:44:20,161 --> 00:44:23,641
Because by knowing that, you are not going
to help yourself.

490
00:44:23,641 --> 00:44:30,671
On the contrary, you are going to feel dejected.

491
00:44:30,671 --> 00:44:40,641
Now please put your hands just like this,
just like this.

492
00:44:40,641 --> 00:44:43,001
And both the feet on the ground, straight.

493
00:44:43,001 --> 00:44:47,641
On the ground.

494
00:44:47,641 --> 00:44:53,731
I think perhaps next Monday is the last meeting,
is it?

495
00:44:53,731 --> 00:44:55,120
Two more?

496
00:44:55,120 --> 00:45:01,131
You are going to have me till the the end
is it?

497
00:45:01,131 --> 00:45:02,131
Alright!

498
00:45:02,131 --> 00:45:05,991
So I was thinking of, next Monday, I’ll
be telling about elements and all those things

499
00:45:05,991 --> 00:45:06,991
how we are made.

500
00:45:06,991 --> 00:45:07,991
That would be better.

501
00:45:07,991 --> 00:45:08,991
Now close your eyes please.

502
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:49,761
If you watch your thoughts you’ll find there
are no thoughts.

503
00:45:49,761 --> 00:46:07,711
Keep your eyes shut.

504
00:46:07,711 --> 00:46:16,681
Just see.

505
00:46:16,681 --> 00:46:48,100
There are no thoughts in your mind.

506
00:46:48,100 --> 00:47:41,951
Now, in your finger tips you’ll feel a cool
breeze coming in.

507
00:47:41,951 --> 00:48:05,702
That means the Realisation has taken place
because the cool breeze is the sign of the

508
00:48:05,702 --> 00:48:13,741
Holy Ghost, in Sanskrit it is, “salilam,
salilam,” described that the Spirit emits

509
00:48:13,741 --> 00:48:31,620
or radiates, you can say, Itself as cool breeze.

510
00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:36,261
The light of the Spirit is the cool breeze.

511
00:48:36,261 --> 00:48:38,761
Power of God.

512
00:48:38,761 --> 00:48:55,841
It’s a breeze like thing which starts floating
or going inside your…If any one of you are

513
00:48:55,841 --> 00:49:01,181
feeling sleepy, keep your eyes open please.

514
00:49:01,181 --> 00:49:03,511
Be alert.

515
00:49:03,511 --> 00:49:13,221
You have to be alert because this is the happening
for which you have been desiring.

516
00:49:13,221 --> 00:49:17,781
See for yourself.

517
00:49:17,781 --> 00:49:22,931
The more desirous you are the better it is.

518
00:49:22,931 --> 00:49:35,401
Are you getting cool breeze in the hand?

519
00:49:35,401 --> 00:49:36,401
Good.

520
00:49:36,401 --> 00:49:37,401
Close your eyes and enjoy yourself.

521
00:49:37,401 --> 00:49:38,401
All those who are getting cool breeze, please
raise your hands, all of you.

522
00:49:38,401 --> 00:49:39,401
All those who are getting cool breeze in the
hand, please raise your hands.

523
00:49:39,401 --> 00:49:40,401
All those who are feeling cool breeze in the
hand, please raise your hands.

524
00:49:40,401 --> 00:49:41,401
Now those who have come today and not yet
Realised and are not getting cool breeze,

525
00:49:41,401 --> 00:49:42,401
please raise your hands.

526
00:49:42,401 --> 00:49:43,401
Can you come forward?

527
00:49:43,401 --> 00:49:44,401
Keep your eyes shut, please.

528
00:49:44,401 --> 00:49:45,401
That lady?

529
00:49:45,401 --> 00:49:46,401
You’re getting the cool breeze in the hands?

530
00:49:46,401 --> 00:49:47,401
Are you feeling any cool breeze?

531
00:49:47,401 --> 00:49:48,401
Lady: Not so much.

532
00:49:48,401 --> 00:49:49,401
Shri Mataji: Not so much?

533
00:49:49,401 --> 00:49:50,401
So you started thinking about it, that’s
all.

534
00:49:50,401 --> 00:49:51,401
Alright.

535
00:49:51,401 --> 00:49:52,401
So for that you ask for forgiveness, that,
“I should not think about it,” and it

536
00:49:52,401 --> 00:49:53,401
will start flowing.

537
00:49:53,401 --> 00:49:54,401
Alright?

538
00:49:54,401 --> 00:49:55,401
By thinking you did not get it.

539
00:49:55,401 --> 00:49:56,401
So, it’s alright now.

540
00:49:56,401 --> 00:49:57,401
Good!

541
00:49:57,401 --> 00:49:58,401
See how clever it is!

542
00:49:58,401 --> 00:49:59,401
Still wearing that?

543
00:49:59,401 --> 00:50:00,401
What is that?

544
00:50:00,401 --> 00:50:01,401
Now see him what’s the matter.

545
00:50:01,401 --> 00:50:02,401
On the heart he is catching.

546
00:50:02,401 --> 00:50:03,401
Now, better now ? It plays tricks.

547
00:50:03,401 --> 00:50:04,401
John, see here, this side.

548
00:50:04,401 --> 00:50:05,401
Don’t watch others at this time.

549
00:50:05,401 --> 00:50:06,401
You watch yourself, alright?

550
00:50:06,401 --> 00:50:07,401
Very important.

551
00:50:07,401 --> 00:50:08,401
You catch people.

552
00:50:08,401 --> 00:50:09,401
Just don’t watch.

553
00:50:09,401 --> 00:50:10,401
Watch yourself.

554
00:50:10,401 --> 00:50:11,401
This is the time to watch yourself, alright?

555
00:50:11,401 --> 00:50:12,401
David, come forward, here.

556
00:50:12,401 --> 00:50:13,401
John, you also come here, I would like to
see you.

557
00:50:13,401 --> 00:50:14,401
John, you come here.

558
00:50:14,401 --> 00:50:15,401
David, you come here.

559
00:50:15,401 --> 00:50:16,401
Lindsey, you also come here.

560
00:50:16,401 --> 00:50:17,401
Let’s see.

561
00:50:17,401 --> 00:50:18,401
You sit down here first.

562
00:50:18,401 --> 00:50:19,401
Lindsey just come here I would like to see
you also.

563
00:50:19,401 --> 00:50:20,401
Just there.

564
00:50:20,401 --> 00:50:21,401
Just somewhere here.

565
00:50:21,401 --> 00:50:22,401
Just sit.

566
00:50:22,401 --> 00:50:23,401
Is that Alan?

567
00:50:23,401 --> 00:50:24,401
How are you?

568
00:50:24,401 --> 00:50:25,401
Better now?

569
00:50:25,401 --> 00:50:26,401
Better?

570
00:50:26,401 --> 00:50:27,401
Can you come forward.

571
00:50:27,401 --> 00:50:28,401
You also.

572
00:50:28,401 --> 00:50:29,401
Just let me see.

573
00:50:29,401 --> 00:50:30,401
I wanted to see your vibrations also.

574
00:50:30,401 --> 00:50:31,401
Yes, please.

575
00:50:31,401 --> 00:50:32,401
Come forward.

576
00:50:32,401 --> 00:50:33,401
Can you take two chairs?

577
00:50:33,401 --> 00:50:34,401
You must see your vibrations.

578
00:50:34,401 --> 00:50:35,401
We must get ourselves corrected.

579
00:50:35,401 --> 00:50:36,401
There may be some sort of a thing because
the vibrations if they are not sucking in

580
00:50:36,401 --> 00:50:37,401
alright, then there is some problem.

581
00:50:37,401 --> 00:50:38,401
Let’s get it alright.

582
00:50:38,401 --> 00:50:39,401
What is there to feel bad about anything whatsoever?

583
00:50:39,401 --> 00:50:40,401
Well, Alan, just come here, if possible.

584
00:50:40,401 --> 00:50:41,401
Alright.

585
00:50:41,401 --> 00:50:42,401
You can take a chair here next to John.

586
00:50:42,401 --> 00:50:42,407
Alan, please open your eyes, please.
