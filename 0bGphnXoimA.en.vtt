WEBVTT

00:09.650 --> 00:25.720
To Truth, Seekers of truth, I bow to all seekers of truth.

00:25.745 --> 00:38.035
So far we didn't know that we haven't got only 'truth'.

00:38.060 --> 00:46.830
That which our intellect thought perfect, we accepted as 'truth'.

00:46.855 --> 01:00.787
Being misguided this brain started
justifying whatever we did.

01:00.811 --> 01:08.539
It is good, it is benificial, we should do this only.

01:08.564 --> 01:12.376
Man deviated away from truth.

01:12.400 --> 01:20.209
After being deviated, it is not known in which ravine he has fallen.

01:20.233 --> 01:29.993
On seeing this, people think how did it happen?

01:30.017 --> 01:32.785
Why did such a situation arise?

01:32.810 --> 01:37.732
The wisdom that man has

01:37.757 --> 01:45.773
why was that wisdom transformed into stupidity?

01:45.797 --> 01:51.009
That which had to be converted into wisdom became foolishness.

01:51.033 --> 01:56.036
And that stupidity resulted in such things

01:56.061 --> 02:04.886
which neither gives happiness to others nor to his own self.

02:04.911 --> 02:10.782
Sometimes we get nervous, when we think what is this going on?

02:10.806 --> 02:18.220
There is bloodshed and every type of violence going on.

02:18.244 --> 02:22.265
Even the kids are not spared.

02:22.289 --> 02:28.797
Many such perversions that have awakened within us

02:28.821 --> 02:33.777
keeping that in view, I can say that it is extreme' Kaliyuga'.

02:33.801 --> 02:37.095
This is extreme limit of 'Kaliyuga'.

02:37.120 --> 02:43.926
It is not even mentioned in scriptures that such a time will come.

02:43.950 --> 02:49.305
They have talked about simple things, I feel.

02:49.329 --> 02:56.586
That people will not have their meals in brass (plates)

02:56.611 --> 02:59.889
instead will have it in iron (plates).

02:59.913 --> 03:06.513
Many such formal things I think, have been written in that.

03:09.464 --> 03:19.025
But the scene before us is horrible and sad.

03:19.050 --> 03:26.962
Behind this one should say, man did not find his path.

03:26.986 --> 03:34.067
Marathi

03:34.091 --> 03:38.956
How much he has drifted away?

03:38.980 --> 03:42.829
He cannot get happiness.

03:42.853 --> 03:48.555
In search of happiness he ran after the wrong things.

03:48.586 --> 03:50.684
This is called 'Mrigh Trishna' (Deer craving).

03:50.708 --> 04:04.961
In this way man after wandering here and there, sank in deep darkness.

04:04.985 --> 04:11.975
He doesn't even know that what he is doing, is an evil deed.

04:11.999 --> 04:17.855
And the result of this evil deed, he as well as others will get.

04:17.880 --> 04:20.996
such things have grown so much that

04:21.021 --> 04:27.714
one doesn’t understand what is going to be the fate of this world.

04:27.738 --> 04:31.100
There are so many questions in our country.

04:31.124 --> 04:33.721
There are so many questions in other countries as well.

04:33.745 --> 04:38.856
To think that foreigners are correct, is wrong.

04:38.880 --> 04:41.581
They are also busy in searching.

04:41.605 --> 04:52.369
In that search they want to find, how they will attain that state

04:52.394 --> 04:59.258
so that they achieve at least the state of humanity.

04:59.282 --> 05:07.497
Whatever is the result of it, is that man gets disappointment.

05:07.521 --> 05:10.201
He feels terribly depressed.

05:10.225 --> 05:14.453
He feels what can be done? it will go on like this.

05:14.478 --> 05:17.784
it cannot be set right.

05:17.808 --> 05:23.056
On such occassions we should remember

05:23.080 --> 05:28.782
that saints have said,"Search it  inside your being only."

05:28.807 --> 05:32.667
Everything is inside your being.

05:32.692 --> 05:39.761
“ Kahe Re Ban Khojan Jai, Sada Niwasi, Sada Alepa, Tohe Sang Smai”.

05:39.786 --> 05:41.912
Who is he?

05:41.937 --> 05:48.184
What is it about which all the saints have said in India

05:48.209 --> 05:53.586
in foreign countries , in all the religions.

05:53.650 --> 05:59.597
Such misrepresentations of religions also has been, that people forgot

05:59.622 --> 06:03.324
we have to search that, which is inside us.

06:03.349 --> 06:07.462
And inside us is our spirit.

06:07.487 --> 06:16.820
In every human being, this spirit is completely in a living state.

06:16.845 --> 06:23.017
This spirit is the reflection of God in our heart.

06:23.042 --> 06:25.682
Everybody has said like that.

06:25.707 --> 06:28.525
Everybody says that spirit is like that.

06:28.550 --> 06:29.499
But people say that

06:29.524 --> 06:32.372
Mother, "we don't know that there is anything like that".

06:32.397 --> 06:39.722
Now, your time has come to know what is our spirit, our inner being?

06:39.747 --> 06:45.842
And how can we know this spirit?

06:45.867 --> 06:53.582
This spirit is as if untouched, watching everything inside.

06:53.607 --> 06:59.332
And wraps its own light inside itself.

06:59.357 --> 07:00.778
It doesn't do even this

07:00.803 --> 07:06.846
that it doesn't even warn us wherever we make any mistake.

07:06.871 --> 07:11.676
Because we change our wisdom into wickedness.

07:11.701 --> 07:15.935
And we cannot see that we are doing anything wrong.

07:15.960 --> 07:19.810
We do every type of wrong Karma.

07:19.835 --> 07:24.578
And we think that we are very nice people.

07:24.603 --> 07:29.060
In this way, we lose our power of discretion.

07:29.085 --> 07:32.409
Now, we have to achieve this spirit.

07:32.434 --> 07:36.683
And how can we achieve this spirit?

07:36.708 --> 07:38.617
This should be understood.

07:38.642 --> 07:58.924
For this only, its arrangement is inside your body.

07:58.949 --> 08:03.476
No need to go outside.

08:03.501 --> 08:07.353
In your triangular bone only

08:07.378 --> 08:12.673
is situated a power called 'Kundalini', a Divine power

08:12.698 --> 08:16.462
and when it is awakened

08:16.947 --> 08:23.806
it pierces six chakras and then last of all, pierces Bramharandra

08:23.831 --> 08:27.169
joins that eternal power(Sukhshm shakti)

08:27.194 --> 08:30.711
that which is the, Divine love of God Almighty.

08:30.736 --> 08:37.840
It was written so in our Scriptures, but nobody follows it.

08:37.865 --> 08:41.166
Many saints of our country went to other countries.

08:41.191 --> 08:43.741
I feel Machinder Nath, Gorukh Naath

08:43.766 --> 08:47.540
they must have gone, because in Bolivia they know everything.

08:47.565 --> 08:53.474
They know the names of chakras and talk about Kundalini awakening.

08:53.499 --> 08:57.503
I found so in Russia as well.

08:57.528 --> 09:02.854
I see everywhere that in the earlier paintings

09:02.879 --> 09:07.502
Whatever the paintings are there, the chakras are made in those.

09:07.527 --> 09:15.478
If you travel a little you will be surprised, how did they know all this?

09:15.503 --> 09:18.270
And how did they know and who told them?

09:18.295 --> 09:26.983
From our country, some saints had gone there, they say like that.

09:27.008 --> 09:31.332
And they said so.

09:31.357 --> 09:34.326
And told us also.

09:34.351 --> 09:36.999
And they have written also

09:37.024 --> 09:41.169
that there is such a Kundalini inside you.

09:41.194 --> 09:51.138
Even as much, that these Nath Panthis didn't tell anyone about it.

09:51.163 --> 09:54.629
Because they would think that if they give this (knowledge )to somebody else,

09:54.654 --> 09:58.493
The people might use it for what purpose

09:58.518 --> 10:00.261
what they will do and what they will not do?

10:00.286 --> 10:03.515
And they are the ones, who read these things

10:03.540 --> 10:06.438
spread all useless notions of the whole world.

10:06.463 --> 10:11.286
And have made it a source of earning money.

10:11.311 --> 10:19.272
So, they must have thought, that it is not to be given to ordinary people.

10:19.297 --> 10:24.293
But it is written in books in twelfth century.

10:24.318 --> 10:28.712
Gyaneshwar ji came and asked his guru

10:28.737 --> 10:30.201
"Please give me permission

10:30.226 --> 10:33.242
i want to write about it (kundalini) in my Gyaneshwari".

10:33.267 --> 10:35.695
He wrote about it in sixth chapter.

10:35.720 --> 10:37.884
But during his time

10:37.909 --> 10:44.374
it is possible that people earn money in the name of spirituality.

10:44.399 --> 10:49.306
So he said, it (6th chapter) is forbidden, is useless to read.

10:49.331 --> 10:51.533
It is not possible for everybody.

10:51.558 --> 10:55.872
Recently, I heard lecture of a great saint.

10:55.897 --> 11:01.506
I was so surprised, how did he? how could he?

11:01.531 --> 11:04.192
You won't understand it easily.

11:04.217 --> 11:06.579
In a way, he abused

11:06.604 --> 11:11.075
that you are all 'PRAVRITI MARGI'.

11:11.100 --> 11:13.021
You are not 'NIVRITI MARGI'.

11:13.046 --> 11:19.047
'PRAVRITI' means, your activity of running here and there, you are that.

11:19.072 --> 11:20.312
Now tell Me!

11:20.337 --> 11:23.031
And everybody was saying,'yes', 'yes'.

11:23.056 --> 11:25.388
And you are not 'NIVRITI MARGI'.

11:25.413 --> 11:29.059
You don't go to Gyan Marg, because Sahaj Yoga is Gyan Marg.

11:29.084 --> 11:34.489
You follow your own ways and serve your gurus.

11:34.514 --> 11:39.298
Give them money, do this to them, do that.

11:39.323 --> 11:41.197
And people agreed.

11:41.222 --> 11:46.341
If somebody tells anyone, "you are not Nivrit Margi".

11:46.366 --> 11:48.879
In a way, it is like abusing him.

11:48.904 --> 11:51.215
But, if a person doesn't know Sanskrit

11:51.240 --> 11:52.419
So whatever they are saying is o.k.

11:52.444 --> 11:54.389
They have made us something.

11:54.414 --> 11:59.700
'Pravriti' means running after wrong things.

11:59.725 --> 12:06.457
So they told them clearly, you serve all gurus.

12:06.482 --> 12:21.815
You get a sac of statues and worship these.

12:21.840 --> 12:25.060
Now they are sitting since 4o'clock and doing.

12:25.085 --> 12:27.925
Do this fasting , do this penance

12:27.950 --> 12:30.623
They prescribed so many rituals to us

12:30.648 --> 12:32.797
that we were robbed off in that.

12:32.822 --> 12:36.645
We could not even understand why are we doing so?

12:36.670 --> 12:38.493
What was its use?

12:38.518 --> 12:44.305
Our grand parents did so and we too are doing the same.

12:44.330 --> 12:49.295
And Mohommad Sahab also said very clearly,"Stop worshipping statues".

12:49.320 --> 12:53.988
Because, it is not known who has made these, and why has he made these?

12:54.013 --> 13:08.363
But ask them, why in Mecca, did he ask them to take a round around a black stone?

13:08.388 --> 13:11.138
What was the speciality of that stone?

13:11.163 --> 13:13.523
What was in that stone?

13:13.548 --> 13:15.566
He would ask people not to worship statues

13:15.591 --> 13:18.456
but why would he make people to take a round around this stone?

13:18.481 --> 13:23.931
The reason was that in Mecca, there is Macceshwarshiv.

13:23.956 --> 13:24.892
He is Shiv.

13:24.917 --> 13:27.316
'Macceshwar' is Shiv.

13:27.341 --> 13:31.936
But, how will you come to know that it is Macceshwar Shiv?

13:31.961 --> 13:36.901
How will you come to know which statue is swambhu?

13:36.926 --> 13:38.992
There is an instrument within you.

13:39.017 --> 13:43.403
For this reason, when the kundalini gets awakened

13:43.428 --> 13:47.221
Crossing the six chakras

13:47.246 --> 13:57.259
when it gets one with that 'Divine Energy' which is all around us

13:57.284 --> 14:04.092
then, vibrations flow in your 'hands' itself.

14:04.117 --> 14:13.634
'Your hands will speak' what is truth and what is untruth?

14:13.659 --> 14:20.981
Such a beautiful arrangement is already there.

14:21.006 --> 14:23.106
There is no need to make arrangements.

14:23.131 --> 14:29.002
Now your hands speak, means your hands know.

14:29.027 --> 14:31.368
This also Mohammed sahab has said that

14:31.393 --> 14:34.430
when 'Kiyama will be there, ' your hands will speak'.

14:34.455 --> 14:37.956
Kiyama has come.

14:37.981 --> 14:42.385
Now get it.

14:42.410 --> 14:44.785
Does anybody read or not, you don't know.

14:44.810 --> 14:50.165
When your hands will speak, you will come to know from hands

14:50.190 --> 14:55.165
what is wrong, what is right and what is truth?

14:55.190 --> 14:59.462
Now if someone says, what is special about Mecca?

14:59.487 --> 15:01.087
Put your hands towards Mecca. and observe.

15:01.112 --> 15:07.834
Those who are Sahajyogis, can see how much vibrations are there.

15:07.859 --> 15:15.993
So, what is truth and what is untruth, you can know on your hands.

15:16.017 --> 15:19.017
It has a beautiful arrangement.

15:19.042 --> 15:23.800
The whole instrument is built within us so beautifully.

15:23.826 --> 15:27.034
And when this arrangement is made

15:27.059 --> 15:30.564
When you get it.

15:30.589 --> 15:36.142
it is so surprising that your own faults dissolve.

15:36.167 --> 15:39.754
You enter into another world.

15:39.779 --> 15:44.370
Lust, anger, attachment, ego, jealousy and greed

15:44.395 --> 15:49.906
your enemies run away from you.

15:49.931 --> 15:52.470
Now, it is very surprising that

15:52.495 --> 15:55.410
when we had first day programme in England

15:55.435 --> 15:58.457
there six drug addicts came.

15:58.482 --> 16:00.321
They would take drugs.

16:00.346 --> 16:03.384
The second day only they got clensed.

16:03.409 --> 16:05.851
It was  very surprising.

16:05.876 --> 16:07.244
How did it happen?

16:07.269 --> 16:08.174
They said,"Don't know.

16:08.199 --> 16:12.567
But now we don't  like it, don't like to look at it."

16:12.592 --> 16:15.795
They only transformed into very nice people.

16:15.820 --> 16:18.318
They have implemented and are working a lot  (for Sahajyoga).

16:18.343 --> 16:23.870
So this thing which has been said, get your self realization

16:23.895 --> 16:26.779
means know your 'own self '.

16:26.804 --> 16:30.323
An arrangement for that too has been made inside our being

16:30.348 --> 16:34.362
as if there is some great Divine Instrument inside our being.

16:34.387 --> 16:37.916
Or, we can say that there is a machine installed within us.

16:37.941 --> 16:40.176
And when it becomes functional

16:40.201 --> 16:42.543
when it starts operating

16:42.568 --> 16:47.792
then you experience many miracles about yourself only.

16:47.817 --> 16:51.980
The drunkards gave up taking drinks.

16:52.005 --> 16:57.769
lot of wicked people gave up their wickedness.

16:57.794 --> 17:07.059
I went to Tolyatti. There was chief, Don of Mafia.

17:07.084 --> 17:10.429
He took to Sahajyoga.

17:10.454 --> 17:13.367
I said , "It is a miracle. How did he come to Sahajyoga"?

17:13.392 --> 17:17.082
They said,"Mother, he has become a Sahajyogi and wants to see you".

17:17.107 --> 17:19.434
He came and was so humble.

17:19.459 --> 17:23.847
And said,"Mother I have committed many sins.

17:23.872 --> 17:27.474
Shall i be forgiven or not, please tell me?"

17:27.499 --> 17:30.602
I said,"What are you talking about"?

17:30.627 --> 17:35.778
The sins you committed are over now, have been in the past.

17:35.803 --> 17:40.343
I am talking to you today about the present.

17:40.368 --> 17:45.498
That thing is over now, and now what are you in the present?

17:45.523 --> 17:49.117
How much you have transformed, see it yourself.

17:49.142 --> 17:54.391
Then, he helped us so much, admired us so much.

17:54.416 --> 17:57.736
In a way, it was so surprising

17:57.761 --> 18:04.824
how this leader of Mafia got transformed.

18:04.849 --> 18:09.280
How did he accept it?

18:09.305 --> 18:11.250
This happened to him.

18:11.275 --> 18:12.687
We did't give him any lecture

18:12.712 --> 18:14.769
neither explained him or told him anything.

18:14.794 --> 18:16.556
It is a happening.

18:16.581 --> 18:20.969
And it is very important for this happening to take place in this Kaliyuga.

18:20.994 --> 18:27.654
Because, man gets transformed.

18:27.679 --> 18:31.561
And when a person gets transformed

18:31.586 --> 18:35.920
he gets so much clensed, he pecomes a beautful personality.

18:35.945 --> 18:40.140
Today, world is in need of such transformation.

18:40.165 --> 18:46.941
And this transformation, I think, you all Sahajyogis should create.

18:46.966 --> 18:51.977
I did as much as I could, went to so many countries.

18:52.002 --> 18:56.831
Now you should, those who are in Sahajyoga or are going to join it

18:56.855 --> 19:02.565
they should save other people. and transform them.

19:02.590 --> 19:04.596
Many people have got diverted.

19:04.621 --> 19:09.566
Means, they have got diverted in the name of God, in the name of Dharma.

19:09.591 --> 19:11.498
They are diverted in the name of anything.

19:11.523 --> 19:18.472
When you will get them into this state

19:18.497 --> 19:22.031
you see then, how their nature will change.

19:22.056 --> 19:25.167
Here so many lights are on.

19:25.192 --> 19:31.019
If these don't have any connection with the mains, can these be on?

19:31.044 --> 19:35.702
In the same way, unless our connection

19:35.727 --> 19:42.151
for example, this mike is not connected with the mains, it has no utility.

19:42.176 --> 19:44.622
The same is our condition

19:44.647 --> 19:50.213
that we are connected to that Divine Power.

19:50.238 --> 19:56.170
And the greatest thing is that this 'truth' is 'love'.

19:56.195 --> 19:59.551
This 'truth' is 'joy'.

19:59.576 --> 20:23.281
When your attention gets enlightened by the light of this Spirit.

20:23.306 --> 20:27.112
If a man gets transformed, how is it going to be problematic?

20:27.137 --> 20:29.547
All the problems are because of human beings.

20:29.572 --> 20:34.379
When a human being will get transformed, there will be no problem

20:34.404 --> 20:36.742
there will be no trouble.

20:36.767 --> 20:41.653
So, we should think that somehow

20:41.678 --> 20:45.808
as much as possible, we should awaken the kundalini of others as well.

20:45.833 --> 20:49.282
And achieve it in this awakening.

20:49.307 --> 20:52.216
After getting it

20:52.241 --> 20:57.456
you see, I have seen that there is neither any quarrel nor any problem.

20:57.481 --> 20:59.826
The people of any country may come from anywhere

20:59.851 --> 21:04.001
neither they create their Fronts, nor raise the flags, nothing.

21:04.025 --> 21:10.625
Just meeting each other, is the greatest joy they get.

21:10.650 --> 21:15.719
It gives great joy when they mix up with each other.

21:15.744 --> 21:20.430
It is our nation's culture that there should be brotherhood

21:20.455 --> 21:23.528
there should be mixing up with everyone.

21:23.553 --> 21:30.410
In every thing we should help each other, this is our culture.

21:30.436 --> 21:34.751
But then some strange incidents took place.

21:34.776 --> 21:38.178
The country got divided into many sects.

21:38.203 --> 21:41.612
So, here also many disputes are going on.

21:41.637 --> 21:43.047
wherever we look into, there are quarrels.

21:43.072 --> 21:45.556
wherever we go, on one side there is one front demonstrating

21:45.581 --> 21:47.571
and somewhere another front.

21:47.596 --> 21:52.612
And take any issue, or in this way any thing

21:52.637 --> 21:55.284
they form a coalition and quarrel.

21:55.309 --> 21:58.992
This is not the sign of humanity.

21:59.017 --> 22:03.242
Even the animals do not do like that, humans should not do so at all.

22:03.267 --> 22:07.627
Human being is the highest category that God has made

22:07.652 --> 22:15.991
and has made such a beautiful, complete arrangement inside our being.

22:16.016 --> 22:22.085
Has made such an arrangement, that you can get it easily.

22:22.110 --> 22:26.316
And for this you don't have to pay any money.

22:26.341 --> 22:28.373
Like, a gentle man told Me

22:28.398 --> 22:33.421
"I will pay you one lac, You awaken my kundalini".

22:33.446 --> 22:38.572
I said,"Sir, I will pay you two lac. you stop this conversation".

22:38.597 --> 22:42.306
Because Kundalini cannot understand money.

22:42.331 --> 22:48.109
Kundalini is a Divine Energy within you.

22:48.134 --> 22:50.432
You must have pure desire.

22:50.457 --> 22:54.835
If you don't have pure desire, it cannot be done forcibly.

22:54.860 --> 22:57.963
Money won't work. You cannot compel.

22:57.988 --> 23:02.928
If you have pure desire, then only this work can be done.

23:02.953 --> 23:05.821
Now, none of our desires is pure.

23:05.846 --> 23:10.962
If it had been pure, your this economics of today would not work.

23:10.986 --> 23:12.790
What is in economics?

23:12.815 --> 23:17.317
That today, for example, with great difficulty , you have constructed a house.

23:17.342 --> 23:19.354
It has no satisfaction.

23:19.379 --> 23:22.933
Then you want a car, that also does not give you satisfaction.

23:22.957 --> 23:25.469
Itf you do not get satisfaction in any way

23:25.494 --> 23:28.931
that means, your desire is not pure.

23:28.955 --> 23:32.509
Had it been pure desire, you would have got satisfaction.

23:32.534 --> 23:36.468
But there is pure desire only in one thing.

23:36.493 --> 23:46.246
And that is, your own spirit should have Atma Sakhshatkar.

23:46.271 --> 23:49.764
The Spirit should be in your attention.

23:49.789 --> 24:02.331
Its light will give you, joy, peace and will give you complete knowledge.

24:02.356 --> 24:07.031
But , above all it will make you collective.

24:07.056 --> 24:10.873
In this, you become collective.

24:10.898 --> 24:22.018
'Collective' means, what we think that we are independant in the world.

24:22.043 --> 24:30.042
In the eyes of God, we are in His protection.

24:30.067 --> 24:32.316
It is the idiocy of mind

24:32.341 --> 24:34.302
that we are superior, they are of lower category

24:34.327 --> 24:35.961
they are this , they are that.

24:35.986 --> 24:38.850
It is all the idiocy of mind.

24:38.875 --> 24:43.740
Today, you see, a gentleman had come to see Me.

24:43.765 --> 24:49.230
He was the chief of The Militry of Ivory Coast.

24:49.255 --> 24:55.587
He was so humble, so humble, that I was surprised.

24:55.612 --> 25:01.309
The chief of that Militry came to Me and Said very humbly

25:01.334 --> 25:09.385
"Mother, plz give Sahajyoga to all the people of our country".

25:09.410 --> 25:12.678
I told him,"O.K you only can make them (Sahaj Yogis) all.".

25:12.703 --> 25:15.323
He said, "I am in complete joy".

25:15.348 --> 25:17.943
He had divorced three wives.

25:17.968 --> 25:24.687
And now he says, "I am ashamed of Myself, what a life i  lived.

25:24.712 --> 25:28.907
Why did i make my life such? I can't understand.

25:28.932 --> 25:31.944
But now i have changed altogether".

25:31.969 --> 25:37.182
And within me, there is so much joy, so much peace and so much pleasure.

25:37.207 --> 25:44.238
And now there are 600 Sahajyogis.

25:44.263 --> 25:46.551
And now they had adopted Islam.

25:46.576 --> 25:49.065
I asked them, "Why did you become Muslims"?

25:49.090 --> 25:58.514
He said, "Because these French people have no morality.

25:58.539 --> 26:01.383
Morality is totally gone.

26:01.408 --> 26:09.079
So we thought, let us adopt Islam, so that atleast morality will remain  in tact".

26:09.104 --> 26:12.469
I said, in Sahajyoga all the religions are equal.

26:12.494 --> 26:14.490
And you are above all religions.

26:14.515 --> 26:18.365
No religion is disrespected. No religion is lower or higher.

26:18.390 --> 26:22.235
On the contrary, you understand your religion in a better way.

26:22.260 --> 26:25.395
You understand the depth of your religion.

26:25.420 --> 26:27.765
Till now you are wandering.

26:27.790 --> 26:33.292
You can get it, which is reality, for which this dharma has been created.

26:33.317 --> 26:38.289
Now a days, they are fighting in the name of Dharma.

26:38.314 --> 26:43.292
How is it possible? It cannot be. It is wrong.

26:43.317 --> 26:45.147
And it is the wrong thing that is being done.

26:45.172 --> 26:50.471
And I will say again that inside us, it is wickedness that is working all this.

26:50.496 --> 26:56.070
Now, even this wickedness of yours is enlightened by your kundalini  .

26:56.095 --> 27:00.480
When it passes through this chakra, which is called Agnya

27:00.505 --> 27:06.668
it enlightens it and you understand,"Oh! what was i doing"?

27:06.693 --> 27:09.310
Why was i running foolishly?

27:09.335 --> 27:11.913
What was i quarreling for?

27:11.938 --> 27:15.532
Unless you know your own self

27:15.557 --> 27:22.042
you cannot recognize truth and you will spoil your life in falsehood.

27:22.067 --> 27:24.437
You will spoil your life, your chidren's life.

27:24.462 --> 27:28.414
Not only this, but whole nation will get devastated.

27:28.439 --> 27:31.630
Many such nations are getting devastated like this.

27:31.655 --> 27:38.545
So, one thing that is in our country and which is very pure

27:38.570 --> 27:41.080
and that is the awakening of your kundalini.

27:41.105 --> 27:44.816
Now, this kundalini is your mother.

27:44.841 --> 27:51.264
Your individual mother, it is absolutely your mother.

27:51.289 --> 27:53.075
She is not the mother of anyone else.

27:53.100 --> 27:57.164
For example, your mother may have five to six, or eight to ten  chidren.

27:57.189 --> 28:00.926
Of this kundalini, only you are the son, you are the daughter.

28:00.951 --> 28:04.383
Now, when this kundalini gets awakened

28:04.408 --> 28:13.693
and when it is awakened, it knows everything about you.

28:13.718 --> 28:17.014
Inside it, is every thing recorded about you.

28:17.039 --> 28:23.200
What do you want, who were you? What are your problems?

28:23.225 --> 28:25.718
What are the problems of your body?

28:25.743 --> 28:28.495
Where, what is the problem, everything is known to it.

28:28.520 --> 28:36.554
Managing that , your mother awakens and does not give you any trouble.

28:36.579 --> 28:40.602
It is so surprising that not even a bit of trouble you will have

28:40.627 --> 28:42.487
because she is mother.

28:42.512 --> 28:47.667
When you were born, your mother took all the trouble upon herself.

28:47.692 --> 28:50.196
She didn't put you to any problem.

28:50.221 --> 28:54.734
In the same way, She is mother and when it gets awakened

28:54.759 --> 29:00.000
you do not face any trouble, there is no problem

29:00.025 --> 29:03.744
and you achieve an absolutely different state.

29:03.769 --> 29:08.140
And then it is a great surprise that you were like that.

29:08.165 --> 29:12.873
All this was within you and you had such a treasure, was totally unknown.

29:12.898 --> 29:16.014
And in every way you are benefitted.

29:16.039 --> 29:21.026
Foe example, physical, mental, intellectual and spiritual.

29:21.051 --> 29:24.429
These chakras work on all four levels.

29:24.454 --> 29:27.956
And this works out on all fronts.

29:27.981 --> 29:31.083
There is no doubt about it that after coming to Sahajyoga

29:31.108 --> 29:33.996
your health improves and everything improves.

29:34.021 --> 29:39.697
Not only this, your financial situation

29:39.722 --> 29:40.956
improves due to the blessings of Lakhshmi.

29:40.981 --> 29:45.568
In our country, all those who have become Sahajyogis

29:45.593 --> 29:49.091
most of them have improved their financial problem.

29:49.116 --> 29:53.240
Their behaviour improved, their disputes are over and every thing.

29:53.265 --> 29:56.972
Because this power is spread all around.

29:56.997 --> 30:00.944
Everywhere it pervades and is working.

30:00.969 --> 30:10.042
And with the help of this power, not only our betterment

30:10.067 --> 30:15.136
but leads to a special type of dignified life.

30:15.160 --> 30:20.621
Such a life, looking at it we say, there is such a person.

30:20.646 --> 30:23.985
We would say like this, for saints.

30:24.010 --> 30:26.654
Today there are so many people in Sahajyoga

30:26.679 --> 30:28.810
and so many have come to Sahajyoga.

30:28.835 --> 30:32.109
The reason of its spreading in so many countries is that

30:32.134 --> 30:35.587
a type of depression in all the countries

30:35.612 --> 30:42.290
a type of disappointment and secondly, lot of violence has increased.

30:42.315 --> 30:48.704
Among those who thought that it is wrong, joined Sahajyoga.

30:48.729 --> 30:53.022
They say, Sahajyoga has spread in eighty six countries.

30:53.047 --> 30:56.729
Although, I have not been to so many countries, is a fact.

30:56.754 --> 31:01.846
But, just as a seed wherever it falls, can grow into a plant

31:01.871 --> 31:05.182
in the same way, Sahajyoga has spread.

31:05.207 --> 31:10.242
It is so surprizing that people from there come to this country

31:10.267 --> 31:16.306
and even they come to Italy, but I have not yet gone to their countries.

31:16.331 --> 31:19.638
And may be I might go sometime.

31:19.663 --> 31:28.415
But their love, their mutual love and mutual mixing up

31:28.440 --> 31:33.913
one gets surprized on seeing that they have, even for one single person.

31:33.938 --> 31:36.169
Recently, when there was bomb blast in Bombay

31:36.194 --> 31:37.546
there was a boy.

31:37.571 --> 31:39.845
He would always say, Mother, "I don't want to live

31:39.870 --> 31:42.142
my mother is very bad, like this, like that".

31:42.167 --> 31:45.769
He would say so repeatedly, and that boy only died.

31:45.794 --> 31:54.619
This news spread in all the countries

31:54.644 --> 32:01.477
and all the people ran, and found out this, that.

32:01.502 --> 32:04.529
Then, there they told them that they are saints.

32:04.554 --> 32:06.254
So they said that we will give you a piece of land

32:06.279 --> 32:10.282
you cremate or bury the dead body if you want, here itself.

32:10.307 --> 32:14.643
Such people sent letters there, that I was amazed.

32:14.668 --> 32:20.692
After this, recently I saw that My brother, Baba Mama expired.

32:20.717 --> 32:22.820
He loved people very much.

32:22.845 --> 32:28.717
So many people have sent faxes, that I could not go through these till now.

32:28.742 --> 32:34.699
So much love, such good talks about him, people have written about him.

32:34.724 --> 32:36.685
I was so surprized.

32:36.710 --> 32:41.500
I wouldn't think that his love had so much got distributed among people.

32:41.525 --> 32:43.871
So many people loved him!

32:43.896 --> 32:50.594
So, this whole environment of love in which everybody loves you

32:50.619 --> 32:52.932
you too will love everybody.

32:52.957 --> 32:56.005
This is the greatest thing about Sahajyoga

32:56.030 --> 32:58.790
that the power of Sahajyoga, is the 'power of love'.

32:58.815 --> 33:03.096
And no other power can overpower it.

33:03.121 --> 33:04.925
There is no greater power than this.

33:04.950 --> 33:11.143
You are enveloped in the greatest power of love

33:11.168 --> 33:14.003
and you are always protected.

33:14.028 --> 33:20.384
Nobody can touch you, because God loves you.

33:20.409 --> 33:28.111
Who dares to go against Him? Who could be hostile to Him?

33:28.136 --> 33:30.755
We have so many examples

33:30.780 --> 33:33.665
that people say,"Mother, how was i saved, can't understand".

33:33.690 --> 33:36.379
"How did i get the blessings? i don't know".

33:36.404 --> 33:41.400
After you listen to all these things, you also feel very happy.

33:41.425 --> 33:43.902
Because they are all your brothers and sisters

33:43.927 --> 33:45.846
they are all yours.

33:45.871 --> 33:51.195
And seeing to that , it appears that the world is going to change.

33:51.220 --> 33:55.687
We will have good time, very good time.

33:55.712 --> 34:04.641
In that people will always

34:04.666 --> 34:10.716
work for a great nation, a great personality and a noble cause.

34:10.741 --> 34:12.699
This has to happen and is happening

34:12.724 --> 34:16.412
but still many people have to be transformed.

34:16.437 --> 34:18.315
Transformation is very important.

34:18.340 --> 34:20.506
and till now you are living as human beings

34:20.531 --> 34:22.879
but have even fallen to a lower level than humanity.

34:22.904 --> 34:26.819
Their transformation is very easy, achieve that.

34:26.844 --> 34:30.715
There is no other way than transformation.

34:30.740 --> 34:35.835
And that happens by kundalini awakening and by nothing else.

34:35.860 --> 34:37.208
Now if somebody asks

34:37.233 --> 34:42.924
"Mother, if we put this mike in water, will it work? No".

34:42.950 --> 34:46.227
Or, if we burn it, will it work? No!

34:46.252 --> 34:49.680
You have to reconnect it then.

34:49.705 --> 34:53.974
You don't have to pay anything, you have to give nothing

34:53.999 --> 34:56.746
but a little bit of time to yourself.

34:56.771 --> 35:01.912
And wherever is your center, go and attain more depth.

35:01.937 --> 35:07.357
Many people follow it very little, and that is why they do not grow.

35:07.382 --> 35:13.784
Unless you give collective love to it

35:13.809 --> 35:18.108
as you have to water your plants and trees

35:18.133 --> 35:23.060
the same way if you don't do so, your plant will not grow.

35:23.085 --> 35:29.016
And that is why Jesus has said, that some seeds fell on stones

35:29.041 --> 35:33.676
some seeds fell on ground and died there only.

35:33.701 --> 35:38.404
But some seeds were such which fell and remained in the fertile land

35:38.429 --> 35:40.529
sprouted and became trees.

35:40.554 --> 35:46.015
So we do not condemn any religion, nor oppose any religion.

35:46.040 --> 35:51.206
The essence of all religions is their speciality

35:51.231 --> 35:56.141
and there is such a strong connection in all these religions

35:56.166 --> 35:57.777
that will be established.

35:57.802 --> 36:07.789
A very great joyful, comfortable, such a life for you in future

36:07.814 --> 36:09.491
is ready for you.

36:09.516 --> 36:25.658
You get it, This is My eternal blessing to you!

36:25.683 --> 36:31.765
I am very sorry that I had to speak in Hindi language

36:31.790 --> 36:36.360
because most of the people understand Hindi here.

36:36.385 --> 36:41.453
And you have heard me many a times in the English language.

36:41.478 --> 36:45.961
Moreover, I found you all meditative just now enjoying

36:45.986 --> 36:48.012
the world inside your heart, I think.

36:48.037 --> 37:01.585
And it was very kind of you! Thank You!

37:01.610 --> 37:05.815
Now I want to tell you that

37:05.840 --> 37:16.592
those who don’t want their kundalini to be awakened please go out.

37:16.617 --> 37:19.781
Because this is not a pageant

37:19.806 --> 37:22.988
and those who want to go in for meditation

37:23.013 --> 37:29.365
you , in a way create problems for them.

37:29.390 --> 37:35.521
So, those who don’t want to meditate, can please go out.

37:35.546 --> 37:38.716
So, you will understand

37:38.741 --> 37:43.114
that it is not your responsibility to sit here.

37:43.139 --> 37:46.643
You have come here, it’s ok, you have listened to the lecture, it is o.k

37:46.668 --> 37:52.031
but if you don't want awakening of your kundalini, you can go out.

37:52.056 --> 38:11.370
Nobody will feel bad about that.

38:11.395 --> 38:21.680
The land on which you are sitting is very sacred land of India.

38:21.705 --> 38:25.561
Your 'Bharat Bhumi' is  'Yog Bhumi"

38:25.586 --> 38:28.284
You don't know its importance.

38:28.309 --> 38:34.716
Those who come from foreign, they on the airport itself

38:34.741 --> 38:39.864
offer 'pranams' bow down to this land and touch it.

38:39.889 --> 38:46.065
And say, –“Mother how these vibrations are flowing in this land”!

38:46.090 --> 38:50.084
You are not aware of it but be aware of it today.

38:50.109 --> 38:52.898
Once I was travelling by aeroplane.

38:52.923 --> 38:56.928
I told to my husband that, we have reached India.

38:56.953 --> 38:58.338
He asked me, "How did you know"?

38:58.363 --> 39:00.893
I told him, "Vibrations are flowing in all the directions".

39:00.918 --> 39:02.972
He enquired from the pilot.

39:02.997 --> 39:05.715
And he told him, "Yes Sir, wo have reached India".

39:05.740 --> 39:08.486
This is your India.

39:08.526 --> 39:14.591
And I have lot of respect for that person, and also recognize him

39:14.616 --> 39:16.972
who is a patriot.

39:16.997 --> 39:19.961
Patriotism is very important for us

39:19.986 --> 39:22.977
because, our country is a special country.

39:23.002 --> 39:25.307
Such a country is nowhere in world.

39:25.332 --> 39:28.374
If you have no respect for your land

39:28.399 --> 39:31.910
you cannot have your Kundalini awakening .

39:31.935 --> 39:36.110
The kundalini of whole universe is in this country.

39:36.135 --> 39:40.360
It is so surprizing, that till now you are ignorant about it.

39:40.385 --> 39:43.211
But the power of this country is great

39:43.236 --> 39:47.943
and one day, the whole world will bow down to you

39:47.968 --> 39:54.181
because we are very powerful.

39:54.206 --> 39:56.997
They will bow down with love and respect

39:57.022 --> 39:59.243
not with the might of the sword.

39:59.268 --> 40:07.448
Because the people of this country, have eaten the grains of this land.

40:07.473 --> 40:09.024
And it is in their blood.

40:09.049 --> 40:12.038
So, 'Desh Bhakti' (Patriotism) is very important for us

40:12.063 --> 40:14.739
especially for Sahajyoga.

40:14.764 --> 40:17.901
Even as much as, the people who have come from foreign countries

40:17.926 --> 40:20.534
have a great respect for India.

40:20.559 --> 40:24.466
Even they have fixed maps of India at their places

40:24.491 --> 40:28.472
and photos of the great personalities of this country

40:28.497 --> 40:29.799
have fixed in their own houses.

40:29.824 --> 40:34.141
And they respect all the Gods and Goddesses

40:34.166 --> 40:36.732
because they are residing in their chakras.

40:36.757 --> 40:45.830
So, we should understand that in a way, unless we have

40:45.855 --> 40:52.929
knowledge about the speciality of our culture and our country

40:52.954 --> 40:55.809
till then, we cannot even love our country.

40:55.834 --> 41:02.548
So, you must think that you are very lucky

41:02.580 --> 41:05.758
that you were born in this country.

41:05.783 --> 41:10.292
You are very fortunate to be in this country.

41:10.317 --> 41:12.770
This land is 'SASYA SHYAMLA' (Lush green and cropwise rich).

41:12.795 --> 41:15.726
We cannot say anything else for this country.

41:15.750 --> 41:21.297
Just now, I told you about your kundalini awakening.

41:21.322 --> 41:23.678
Every body is sitting, and nobody has gone.

41:23.703 --> 41:28.479
That means you want your realization.

41:28.504 --> 41:35.619
So this is a very good thing. And it’s very encouraging to see this.

41:35.644 --> 41:38.914
O.kay! it is very easy!

41:38.939 --> 41:42.047
You are Indians and you are sitting on this land.

41:42.072 --> 41:44.223
For you it is not difficult at all.

41:44.248 --> 41:46.613
At other places My hands break.

41:46.638 --> 41:53.501
But God has given such a speciality to Indians of spiritual life

41:53.526 --> 41:58.577
that they find no difficulty and this work is done very easily.

41:58.602 --> 42:09.477
Now, you put your both the hands towards Me.

42:09.502 --> 42:13.604
Don't close your eyes. Please don't close your eyes.

42:13.629 --> 42:26.685
Just keep both the hands towards Me.

42:26.710 --> 42:30.435
Now, please put your left hand towards Me

42:30.460 --> 42:33.984
and right hand on the top of your head.

42:34.009 --> 42:43.611
Put your left hand towards Me and right hand on the Fontanel bone

42:43.636 --> 42:49.981
above the bone which is a soft bone in the childhood.

42:50.006 --> 42:55.226
And move your hand, above, below, on both sides.

42:55.251 --> 43:03.577
And check, if there is any cool or hot breeze coming out of it.

43:03.602 --> 43:05.571
This has been called 'Spand.'

43:05.596 --> 43:12.724
Check, if there is any cool or hot breeze.

43:12.749 --> 43:18.217
Now put your right hand towards Me.

43:18.242 --> 43:21.260
I am saying 'Right' and 'Left' in English

43:21.285 --> 43:26.291
because in Hindi language, every where it is spoken in a different way.

43:26.316 --> 43:28.954
Put your right hand towards Me

43:28.979 --> 43:33.967
and with left hand check over the top of your head, bend your head.

43:33.992 --> 43:35.308
Bend your head and check.

43:35.333 --> 43:38.563
Please bend your head and see for yourself

43:38.588 --> 43:44.523
if you are getting cool breeze or hot breeze from your Fontanel bone?

43:44.548 --> 43:51.080
Check! Some feel it much higher, some feel it in different directions.

43:51.105 --> 43:54.507
But you feel it.

43:54.532 --> 43:57.117
You must experience it.

43:57.142 --> 44:02.890
It is an experience. Without experiencing, you should not believe in anything.

44:02.915 --> 44:10.201
And now put your left hand towards Me and check with your right hand

44:10.226 --> 44:19.119
that from your head, if cool or hot breeze is coming?

44:19.144 --> 44:25.450
Now, hot breeze is coming, because you have not forgiven anyone till now.

44:25.475 --> 44:30.134
You have to forgive yourself as well as others.

44:30.159 --> 44:33.683
You just say,"Mother, i have forgiven everyone

44:33.708 --> 44:35.857
and forgiven myself as well".

44:35.882 --> 44:51.135
See, you will be surprized, that cool breeze has started coming.

44:51.160 --> 44:58.593
Now, put your both the hands towards Me.

44:58.618 --> 45:00.604
Both the hands.

45:00.629 --> 45:06.012
And try to be thoughtless.

45:06.037 --> 45:08.791
Be in thoughtless awareness.

45:08.816 --> 45:14.161
Because thoughts only make us stupid.

45:14.186 --> 45:33.908
You be in thoughtless awareness.

45:33.933 --> 45:45.341
Now those who are getting cool breeze in their hands or fingers

45:45.366 --> 45:50.141
or cool or hot breeze on their palms

45:50.166 --> 45:56.369
or cool or hot breeze from head

45:56.394 --> 46:02.190
all those, raise your both the hands.

46:02.215 --> 46:06.665
I am saying , those who get cool or hot breeze

46:06.690 --> 46:10.988
Wow! Whole Delhi of yours!

46:11.013 --> 46:14.289
Wow...........what to say!

46:14.314 --> 46:16.156
Eternal blessings to all of you!

46:16.181 --> 46:20.700
From My heart, I say, eternal blessings to you!

46:20.726 --> 46:25.544
Whole of Delhi has got it. what else do you want?

46:25.569 --> 46:31.818
Eternal blessings! Eternal blessings!

46:31.843 --> 46:33.590
May God bless you all!

46:33.615 --> 46:45.195
You all got realization. The whole of Delhi, imagine!

46:45.220 --> 46:49.193
Now, you have to meditate a little bit.

46:49.218 --> 46:53.434
Now for that, there are centers everywhere.

46:53.459 --> 46:58.167
You will have to meditate, for 5-10 minutes, not more than that.

46:58.192 --> 47:01.738
And after that you see your condition, how you will be.

47:01.763 --> 47:04.085
You will be feel joy.

47:04.110 --> 47:08.486
You will be drenched in the big ocean of joy.

47:08.511 --> 47:11.339
The drop will become an ocean.

47:11.364 --> 47:13.034
You will enjoy yourself.

47:13.059 --> 47:41.566
My love and eternal blessings to everyone!

47:41.591 --> 47:45.264
Now they want to sing a song.

47:45.289 --> 47:50.017
I had written this song in twelfth century.

47:50.042 --> 47:54.048
Even now , it is sung in villages in Marathi language.

47:54.073 --> 47:58.383
They are saying, they will sing that song.

47:58.408 --> 48:01.836
In that song, kundalini has been called as 'Amba'

48:01.861 --> 48:07.338
and it is said, "Amba get awakened".

48:07.363 --> 48:11.663
People don't know what it is!

48:11.688 --> 48:14.430
They have been singing it for the past so many years

48:14.455 --> 48:19.710
but they don't know what they are singing! what are they saying!

48:19.735 --> 48:24.617
It is such a beautiful description.

48:24.642 --> 48:31.556
God! I have cleansed myself, now awaken this 'Amba'.

48:31.581 --> 48:49.701
This 'Amba' is the kundalini and awaken it.
