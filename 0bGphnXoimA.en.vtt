00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:25.720
To Truth, Seekers of truth, I bow to all seekers of truth.

00:00:25.745 --> 00:00:38.035
So far we didn't know that we haven't got only 'truth'.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:46.830
That which our intellect thought perfect, we accepted as 'truth'.

00:00:46.855 --> 00:01:00.787
Being misguided this brain started
justifying whatever we did.

00:01:00.811 --> 00:01:08.539
It is good, it is benificial, we should do this only.

00:01:08.564 --> 00:01:12.376
Man deviated away from truth.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:20.209
After being deviated, it is not known in which ravine he has fallen.

00:01:20.233 --> 00:01:29.993
On seeing this, people think how did it happen?

00:01:30.017 --> 00:01:32.785
Why did such a situation arise?

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.732
The wisdom that man has

00:01:37.757 --> 00:01:45.773
why was that wisdom transformed into stupidity?

00:01:45.797 --> 00:01:51.009
That which had to be converted into wisdom became foolishness.

00:01:51.033 --> 00:01:56.036
And that stupidity resulted in such things

00:01:56.061 --> 00:02:04.886
which neither gives happiness to others nor to his own self.

00:02:04.911 --> 00:02:10.782
Sometimes we get nervous, when we think what is this going on?

00:02:10.806 --> 00:02:18.220
There is bloodshed and every type of violence going on.

00:02:18.244 --> 00:02:22.265
Even the kids are not spared.

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:28.797
Many such perversions that have awakened within us

00:02:28.821 --> 00:02:33.777
keeping that in view, I can say that it is extreme' Kaliyuga'.

00:02:33.801 --> 00:02:37.095
This is extreme limit of 'Kaliyuga'.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:43.926
It is not even mentioned in scriptures that such a time will come.

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:49.305
They have talked about simple things, I feel.

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:56.586
That people will not have their meals in brass (plates)

00:02:56.611 --> 00:02:59.889
instead will have it in iron (plates).

00:02:59.913 --> 00:03:06.513
Many such formal things I think, have been written in that.

00:03:09.464 --> 00:03:19.025
But the scene before us is horrible and sad.

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:26.962
Behind this one should say, man did not find his path.

00:03:26.986 --> 00:03:34.067
Marathi

00:03:34.091 --> 00:03:38.956
How much he has drifted away?

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.829
He cannot get happiness.

00:03:42.853 --> 00:03:48.555
In search of happiness he ran after the wrong things.

00:03:48.586 --> 00:03:50.684
This is called 'Mrigh Trishna' (Deer craving).

00:03:50.708 --> 00:04:04.961
In this way man after wandering here and there, sank in deep darkness.

00:04:04.985 --> 00:04:11.975
He doesn't even know that what he is doing, is an evil deed.

00:04:11.999 --> 00:04:17.855
And the result of this evil deed, he as well as others will get.

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.996
such things have grown so much that

00:04:21.021 --> 00:04:27.714
one doesn’t understand what is going to be the fate of this world.

00:04:27.738 --> 00:04:31.100
There are so many questions in our country.

00:04:31.124 --> 00:04:33.721
There are so many questions in other countries as well.

00:04:33.745 --> 00:04:38.856
To think that foreigners are correct, is wrong.

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.581
They are also busy in searching.

00:04:41.605 --> 00:04:52.369
In that search they want to find, how they will attain that state

00:04:52.394 --> 00:04:59.258
so that they achieve at least the state of humanity.

00:04:59.282 --> 00:05:07.497
Whatever is the result of it, is that man gets disappointment.

00:05:07.521 --> 00:05:10.201
He feels terribly depressed.

00:05:10.225 --> 00:05:14.453
He feels what can be done? it will go on like this.

00:05:14.478 --> 00:05:17.784
it cannot be set right.

00:05:17.808 --> 00:05:23.056
On such occassions we should remember

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:28.782
that saints have said,"Search it  inside your being only."

00:05:28.807 --> 00:05:32.667
Everything is inside your being.

00:05:32.692 --> 00:05:39.761
“ Kahe Re Ban Khojan Jai, Sada Niwasi, Sada Alepa, Tohe Sang Smai”.

00:05:39.786 --> 00:05:41.912
Who is he?

00:05:41.937 --> 00:05:48.184
What is it about which all the saints have said in India

00:05:48.209 --> 00:05:53.586
in foreign countries , in all the religions.

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:59.597
Such misrepresentations of religions also has been, that people forgot

00:05:59.622 --> 00:06:03.324
we have to search that, which is inside us.

00:06:03.349 --> 00:06:07.462
And inside us is our spirit.

00:06:07.487 --> 00:06:16.820
In every human being, this spirit is completely in a living state.

00:06:16.845 --> 00:06:23.017
This spirit is the reflection of God in our heart.

00:06:23.042 --> 00:06:25.682
Everybody has said like that.

00:06:25.707 --> 00:06:28.525
Everybody says that spirit is like that.

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:29.499
But people say that

00:06:29.524 --> 00:06:32.372
Mother, "we don't know that there is anything like that".

00:06:32.397 --> 00:06:39.722
Now, your time has come to know what is our spirit, our inner being?

00:06:39.747 --> 00:06:45.842
And how can we know this spirit?

00:06:45.867 --> 00:06:53.582
This spirit is as if untouched, watching everything inside.

00:06:53.607 --> 00:06:59.332
And wraps its own light inside itself.

00:06:59.357 --> 00:07:00.778
It doesn't do even this

00:07:00.803 --> 00:07:06.846
that it doesn't even warn us wherever we make any mistake.

00:07:06.871 --> 00:07:11.676
Because we change our wisdom into wickedness.

00:07:11.701 --> 00:07:15.935
And we cannot see that we are doing anything wrong.

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:19.810
We do every type of wrong Karma.

00:07:19.835 --> 00:07:24.578
And we think that we are very nice people.

00:07:24.603 --> 00:07:29.060
In this way, we lose our power of discretion.

00:07:29.085 --> 00:07:32.409
Now, we have to achieve this spirit.

00:07:32.434 --> 00:07:36.683
And how can we achieve this spirit?

00:07:36.708 --> 00:07:38.617
This should be understood.

00:07:38.642 --> 00:07:58.924
For this only, its arrangement is inside your body.

00:07:58.949 --> 00:08:03.476
No need to go outside.

00:08:03.501 --> 00:08:07.353
In your triangular bone only

00:08:07.378 --> 00:08:12.673
is situated a power called 'Kundalini', a Divine power

00:08:12.698 --> 00:08:16.462
and when it is awakened

00:08:16.947 --> 00:08:23.806
it pierces six chakras and then last of all, pierces Bramharandra

00:08:23.831 --> 00:08:27.169
joins that eternal power(Sukhshm shakti)

00:08:27.194 --> 00:08:30.711
that which is the, Divine love of God Almighty.

00:08:30.736 --> 00:08:37.840
It was written so in our Scriptures, but nobody follows it.

00:08:37.865 --> 00:08:41.166
Many saints of our country went to other countries.

00:08:41.191 --> 00:08:43.741
I feel Machinder Nath, Gorukh Naath

00:08:43.766 --> 00:08:47.540
they must have gone, because in Bolivia they know everything.

00:08:47.565 --> 00:08:53.474
They know the names of chakras and talk about Kundalini awakening.

00:08:53.499 --> 00:08:57.503
I found so in Russia as well.

00:08:57.528 --> 00:09:02.854
I see everywhere that in the earlier paintings

00:09:02.879 --> 00:09:07.502
Whatever the paintings are there, the chakras are made in those.

00:09:07.527 --> 00:09:15.478
If you travel a little you will be surprised, how did they know all this?

00:09:15.503 --> 00:09:18.270
And how did they know and who told them?

00:09:18.295 --> 00:09:26.983
From our country, some saints had gone there, they say like that.

00:09:27.008 --> 00:09:31.332
And they said so.

00:09:31.357 --> 00:09:34.326
And told us also.

00:09:34.351 --> 00:09:36.999
And they have written also

00:09:37.024 --> 00:09:41.169
that there is such a Kundalini inside you.

00:09:41.194 --> 00:09:51.138
Even as much, that these Nath Panthis didn't tell anyone about it.

00:09:51.163 --> 00:09:54.629
Because they would think that if they give this (knowledge )to somebody else,

00:09:54.654 --> 00:09:58.493
The people might use it for what purpose

00:09:58.518 --> 00:10:00.261
what they will do and what they will not do?

00:10:00.286 --> 00:10:03.515
And they are the ones, who read these things

00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:06.438
spread all useless notions of the whole world.

00:10:06.463 --> 00:10:11.286
And have made it a source of earning money.

00:10:11.311 --> 00:10:19.272
So, they must have thought, that it is not to be given to ordinary people.

00:10:19.297 --> 00:10:24.293
But it is written in books in twelfth century.

00:10:24.318 --> 00:10:28.712
Gyaneshwar ji came and asked his guru

00:10:28.737 --> 00:10:30.201
"Please give me permission

00:10:30.226 --> 00:10:33.242
i want to write about it (kundalini) in my Gyaneshwari".

00:10:33.267 --> 00:10:35.695
He wrote about it in sixth chapter.

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:37.884
But during his time

00:10:37.909 --> 00:10:44.374
it is possible that people earn money in the name of spirituality.

00:10:44.399 --> 00:10:49.306
So he said, it (6th chapter) is forbidden, is useless to read.

00:10:49.331 --> 00:10:51.533
It is not possible for everybody.

00:10:51.558 --> 00:10:55.872
Recently, I heard lecture of a great saint.

00:10:55.897 --> 00:11:01.506
I was so surprised, how did he? how could he?

00:11:01.531 --> 00:11:04.192
You won't understand it easily.

00:11:04.217 --> 00:11:06.579
In a way, he abused

00:11:06.604 --> 00:11:11.075
that you are all 'PRAVRITI MARGI'.

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:13.021
You are not 'NIVRITI MARGI'.

00:11:13.046 --> 00:11:19.047
'PRAVRITI' means, your activity of running here and there, you are that.

00:11:19.072 --> 00:11:20.312
Now tell Me!

00:11:20.337 --> 00:11:23.031
And everybody was saying,'yes', 'yes'.

00:11:23.056 --> 00:11:25.388
And you are not 'NIVRITI MARGI'.

00:11:25.413 --> 00:11:29.059
You don't go to Gyan Marg, because Sahaj Yoga is Gyan Marg.

00:11:29.084 --> 00:11:34.489
You follow your own ways and serve your gurus.

00:11:34.514 --> 00:11:39.298
Give them money, do this to them, do that.

00:11:39.323 --> 00:11:41.197
And people agreed.

00:11:41.222 --> 00:11:46.341
If somebody tells anyone, "you are not Nivrit Margi".

00:11:46.366 --> 00:11:48.879
In a way, it is like abusing him.

00:11:48.904 --> 00:11:51.215
But, if a person doesn't know Sanskrit

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:52.419
So whatever they are saying is o.k.

00:11:52.444 --> 00:11:54.389
They have made us something.

00:11:54.414 --> 00:11:59.700
'Pravriti' means running after wrong things.

00:11:59.725 --> 00:12:06.457
So they told them clearly, you serve all gurus.

00:12:06.482 --> 00:12:21.815
You get a sac of statues and worship these.

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:25.060
Now they are sitting since 4o'clock and doing.

00:12:25.085 --> 00:12:27.925
Do this fasting , do this penance

00:12:27.950 --> 00:12:30.623
They prescribed so many rituals to us

00:12:30.648 --> 00:12:32.797
that we were robbed off in that.

00:12:32.822 --> 00:12:36.645
We could not even understand why are we doing so?

00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:38.493
What was its use?

00:12:38.518 --> 00:12:44.305
Our grand parents did so and we too are doing the same.

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:49.295
And Mohommad Sahab also said very clearly,"Stop worshipping statues".

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:53.988
Because, it is not known who has made these, and why has he made these?

00:12:54.013 --> 00:13:08.363
But ask them, why in Mecca, did he ask them to take a round around a black stone?

00:13:08.388 --> 00:13:11.138
What was the speciality of that stone?

00:13:11.163 --> 00:13:13.523
What was in that stone?

00:13:13.548 --> 00:13:15.566
He would ask people not to worship statues

00:13:15.591 --> 00:13:18.456
but why would he make people to take a round around this stone?

00:13:18.481 --> 00:13:23.931
The reason was that in Mecca, there is Macceshwarshiv.

00:13:23.956 --> 00:13:24.892
He is Shiv.

00:13:24.917 --> 00:13:27.316
'Macceshwar' is Shiv.

00:13:27.341 --> 00:13:31.936
But, how will you come to know that it is Macceshwar Shiv?

00:13:31.961 --> 00:13:36.901
How will you come to know which statue is swambhu?

00:13:36.926 --> 00:13:38.992
There is an instrument within you.

00:13:39.017 --> 00:13:43.403
For this reason, when the kundalini gets awakened

00:13:43.428 --> 00:13:47.221
Crossing the six chakras

00:13:47.246 --> 00:13:57.259
when it gets one with that 'Divine Energy' which is all around us

00:13:57.284 --> 00:14:04.092
then, vibrations flow in your 'hands' itself.

00:14:04.117 --> 00:14:13.634
'Your hands will speak' what is truth and what is untruth?

00:14:13.659 --> 00:14:20.981
Such a beautiful arrangement is already there.

00:14:21.006 --> 00:14:23.106
There is no need to make arrangements.

00:14:23.131 --> 00:14:29.002
Now your hands speak, means your hands know.

00:14:29.027 --> 00:14:31.368
This also Mohammed sahab has said that

00:14:31.393 --> 00:14:34.430
when 'Kiyama will be there, ' your hands will speak'.

00:14:34.455 --> 00:14:37.956
Kiyama has come.

00:14:37.981 --> 00:14:42.385
Now get it.

00:14:42.410 --> 00:14:44.785
Does anybody read or not, you don't know.

00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:50.165
When your hands will speak, you will come to know from hands

00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:55.165
what is wrong, what is right and what is truth?

00:14:55.190 --> 00:14:59.462
Now if someone says, what is special about Mecca?

00:14:59.487 --> 00:15:01.087
Put your hands towards Mecca. and observe.

00:15:01.112 --> 00:15:07.834
Those who are Sahajyogis, can see how much vibrations are there.

00:15:07.859 --> 00:15:15.993
So, what is truth and what is untruth, you can know on your hands.

00:15:16.017 --> 00:15:19.017
It has a beautiful arrangement.

00:15:19.042 --> 00:15:23.800
The whole instrument is built within us so beautifully.

00:15:23.826 --> 00:15:27.034
And when this arrangement is made

00:15:27.059 --> 00:15:30.564
When you get it.

00:15:30.589 --> 00:15:36.142
it is so surprising that your own faults dissolve.

00:15:36.167 --> 00:15:39.754
You enter into another world.

00:15:39.779 --> 00:15:44.370
Lust, anger, attachment, ego, jealousy and greed

00:15:44.395 --> 00:15:49.906
your enemies run away from you.

00:15:49.931 --> 00:15:52.470
Now, it is very surprising that

00:15:52.495 --> 00:15:55.410
when we had first day programme in England

00:15:55.435 --> 00:15:58.457
there six drug addicts came.

00:15:58.482 --> 00:16:00.321
They would take drugs.

00:16:00.346 --> 00:16:03.384
The second day only they got clensed.

00:16:03.409 --> 00:16:05.851
It was  very surprising.

00:16:05.876 --> 00:16:07.244
How did it happen?

00:16:07.269 --> 00:16:08.174
They said,"Don't know.

00:16:08.199 --> 00:16:12.567
But now we don't  like it, don't like to look at it."

00:16:12.592 --> 00:16:15.795
They only transformed into very nice people.

00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:18.318
They have implemented and are working a lot  (for Sahajyoga).

00:16:18.343 --> 00:16:23.870
So this thing which has been said, get your self realization

00:16:23.895 --> 00:16:26.779
means know your 'own self '.

00:16:26.804 --> 00:16:30.323
An arrangement for that too has been made inside our being

00:16:30.348 --> 00:16:34.362
as if there is some great Divine Instrument inside our being.

00:16:34.387 --> 00:16:37.916
Or, we can say that there is a machine installed within us.

00:16:37.941 --> 00:16:40.176
And when it becomes functional

00:16:40.201 --> 00:16:42.543
when it starts operating

00:16:42.568 --> 00:16:47.792
then you experience many miracles about yourself only.

00:16:47.817 --> 00:16:51.980
The drunkards gave up taking drinks.

00:16:52.005 --> 00:16:57.769
lot of wicked people gave up their wickedness.

00:16:57.794 --> 00:17:07.059
I went to Tolyatti. There was chief, Don of Mafia.

00:17:07.084 --> 00:17:10.429
He took to Sahajyoga.

00:17:10.454 --> 00:17:13.367
I said , "It is a miracle. How did he come to Sahajyoga"?

00:17:13.392 --> 00:17:17.082
They said,"Mother, he has become a Sahajyogi and wants to see you".

00:17:17.107 --> 00:17:19.434
He came and was so humble.

00:17:19.459 --> 00:17:23.847
And said,"Mother I have committed many sins.

00:17:23.872 --> 00:17:27.474
Shall i be forgiven or not, please tell me?"

00:17:27.499 --> 00:17:30.602
I said,"What are you talking about"?

00:17:30.627 --> 00:17:35.778
The sins you committed are over now, have been in the past.

00:17:35.803 --> 00:17:40.343
I am talking to you today about the present.

00:17:40.368 --> 00:17:45.498
That thing is over now, and now what are you in the present?

00:17:45.523 --> 00:17:49.117
How much you have transformed, see it yourself.

00:17:49.142 --> 00:17:54.391
Then, he helped us so much, admired us so much.

00:17:54.416 --> 00:17:57.736
In a way, it was so surprising

00:17:57.761 --> 00:18:04.824
how this leader of Mafia got transformed.

00:18:04.849 --> 00:18:09.280
How did he accept it?

00:18:09.305 --> 00:18:11.250
This happened to him.

00:18:11.275 --> 00:18:12.687
We did't give him any lecture

00:18:12.712 --> 00:18:14.769
neither explained him or told him anything.

00:18:14.794 --> 00:18:16.556
It is a happening.

00:18:16.581 --> 00:18:20.969
And it is very important for this happening to take place in this Kaliyuga.

00:18:20.994 --> 00:18:27.654
Because, man gets transformed.

00:18:27.679 --> 00:18:31.561
And when a person gets transformed

00:18:31.586 --> 00:18:35.920
he gets so much clensed, he pecomes a beautful personality.

00:18:35.945 --> 00:18:40.140
Today, world is in need of such transformation.

00:18:40.165 --> 00:18:46.941
And this transformation, I think, you all Sahajyogis should create.

00:18:46.966 --> 00:18:51.977
I did as much as I could, went to so many countries.

00:18:52.002 --> 00:18:56.831
Now you should, those who are in Sahajyoga or are going to join it

00:18:56.855 --> 00:19:02.565
they should save other people. and transform them.

00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:04.596
Many people have got diverted.

00:19:04.621 --> 00:19:09.566
Means, they have got diverted in the name of God, in the name of Dharma.

00:19:09.591 --> 00:19:11.498
They are diverted in the name of anything.

00:19:11.523 --> 00:19:18.472
When you will get them into this state

00:19:18.497 --> 00:19:22.031
you see then, how their nature will change.

00:19:22.056 --> 00:19:25.167
Here so many lights are on.

00:19:25.192 --> 00:19:31.019
If these don't have any connection with the mains, can these be on?

00:19:31.044 --> 00:19:35.702
In the same way, unless our connection

00:19:35.727 --> 00:19:42.151
for example, this mike is not connected with the mains, it has no utility.

00:19:42.176 --> 00:19:44.622
The same is our condition

00:19:44.647 --> 00:19:50.213
that we are connected to that Divine Power.

00:19:50.238 --> 00:19:56.170
And the greatest thing is that this 'truth' is 'love'.

00:19:56.195 --> 00:19:59.551
This 'truth' is 'joy'.

00:19:59.576 --> 00:20:23.281
When your attention gets enlightened by the light of this Spirit.

00:20:23.306 --> 00:20:27.112
If a man gets transformed, how is it going to be problematic?

00:20:27.137 --> 00:20:29.547
All the problems are because of human beings.

00:20:29.572 --> 00:20:34.379
When a human being will get transformed, there will be no problem

00:20:34.404 --> 00:20:36.742
there will be no trouble.

00:20:36.767 --> 00:20:41.653
So, we should think that somehow

00:20:41.678 --> 00:20:45.808
as much as possible, we should awaken the kundalini of others as well.

00:20:45.833 --> 00:20:49.282
And achieve it in this awakening.

00:20:49.307 --> 00:20:52.216
After getting it

00:20:52.241 --> 00:20:57.456
you see, I have seen that there is neither any quarrel nor any problem.

00:20:57.481 --> 00:20:59.826
The people of any country may come from anywhere

00:20:59.851 --> 00:21:04.001
neither they create their Fronts, nor raise the flags, nothing.

00:21:04.025 --> 00:21:10.625
Just meeting each other, is the greatest joy they get.

00:21:10.650 --> 00:21:15.719
It gives great joy when they mix up with each other.

00:21:15.744 --> 00:21:20.430
It is our nation's culture that there should be brotherhood

00:21:20.455 --> 00:21:23.528
there should be mixing up with everyone.

00:21:23.553 --> 00:21:30.410
In every thing we should help each other, this is our culture.

00:21:30.436 --> 00:21:34.751
But then some strange incidents took place.

00:21:34.776 --> 00:21:38.178
The country got divided into many sects.

00:21:38.203 --> 00:21:41.612
So, here also many disputes are going on.

00:21:41.637 --> 00:21:43.047
wherever we look into, there are quarrels.

00:21:43.072 --> 00:21:45.556
wherever we go, on one side there is one front demonstrating

00:21:45.581 --> 00:21:47.571
and somewhere another front.

00:21:47.596 --> 00:21:52.612
And take any issue, or in this way any thing

00:21:52.637 --> 00:21:55.284
they form a coalition and quarrel.

00:21:55.309 --> 00:21:58.992
This is not the sign of humanity.

00:21:59.017 --> 00:22:03.242
Even the animals do not do like that, humans should not do so at all.

00:22:03.267 --> 00:22:07.627
Human being is the highest category that God has made

00:22:07.652 --> 00:22:15.991
and has made such a beautiful, complete arrangement inside our being.

00:22:16.016 --> 00:22:22.085
Has made such an arrangement, that you can get it easily.

00:22:22.110 --> 00:22:26.316
And for this you don't have to pay any money.

00:22:26.341 --> 00:22:28.373
Like, a gentle man told Me

00:22:28.398 --> 00:22:33.421
"I will pay you one lac, You awaken my kundalini".

00:22:33.446 --> 00:22:38.572
I said,"Sir, I will pay you two lac. you stop this conversation".

00:22:38.597 --> 00:22:42.306
Because Kundalini cannot understand money.

00:22:42.331 --> 00:22:48.109
Kundalini is a Divine Energy within you.

00:22:48.134 --> 00:22:50.432
You must have pure desire.

00:22:50.457 --> 00:22:54.835
If you don't have pure desire, it cannot be done forcibly.

00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:57.963
Money won't work. You cannot compel.

00:22:57.988 --> 00:23:02.928
If you have pure desire, then only this work can be done.

00:23:02.953 --> 00:23:05.821
Now, none of our desires is pure.

00:23:05.846 --> 00:23:10.962
If it had been pure, your this economics of today would not work.

00:23:10.986 --> 00:23:12.790
What is in economics?

00:23:12.815 --> 00:23:17.317
That today, for example, with great difficulty , you have constructed a house.

00:23:17.342 --> 00:23:19.354
It has no satisfaction.

00:23:19.379 --> 00:23:22.933
Then you want a car, that also does not give you satisfaction.

00:23:22.957 --> 00:23:25.469
Itf you do not get satisfaction in any way

00:23:25.494 --> 00:23:28.931
that means, your desire is not pure.

00:23:28.955 --> 00:23:32.509
Had it been pure desire, you would have got satisfaction.

00:23:32.534 --> 00:23:36.468
But there is pure desire only in one thing.

00:23:36.493 --> 00:23:46.246
And that is, your own spirit should have Atma Sakhshatkar.

00:23:46.271 --> 00:23:49.764
The Spirit should be in your attention.

00:23:49.789 --> 00:24:02.331
Its light will give you, joy, peace and will give you complete knowledge.

00:24:02.356 --> 00:24:07.031
But , above all it will make you collective.

00:24:07.056 --> 00:24:10.873
In this, you become collective.

00:24:10.898 --> 00:24:22.018
'Collective' means, what we think that we are independant in the world.

00:24:22.043 --> 00:24:30.042
In the eyes of God, we are in His protection.

00:24:30.067 --> 00:24:32.316
It is the idiocy of mind

00:24:32.341 --> 00:24:34.302
that we are superior, they are of lower category

00:24:34.327 --> 00:24:35.961
they are this , they are that.

00:24:35.986 --> 00:24:38.850
It is all the idiocy of mind.

00:24:38.875 --> 00:24:43.740
Today, you see, a gentleman had come to see Me.

00:24:43.765 --> 00:24:49.230
He was the chief of The Militry of Ivory Coast.

00:24:49.255 --> 00:24:55.587
He was so humble, so humble, that I was surprised.

00:24:55.612 --> 00:25:01.309
The chief of that Militry came to Me and Said very humbly

00:25:01.334 --> 00:25:09.385
"Mother, plz give Sahajyoga to all the people of our country".

00:25:09.410 --> 00:25:12.678
I told him,"O.K you only can make them (Sahaj Yogis) all.".

00:25:12.703 --> 00:25:15.323
He said, "I am in complete joy".

00:25:15.348 --> 00:25:17.943
He had divorced three wives.

00:25:17.968 --> 00:25:24.687
And now he says, "I am ashamed of Myself, what a life i  lived.

00:25:24.712 --> 00:25:28.907
Why did i make my life such? I can't understand.

00:25:28.932 --> 00:25:31.944
But now i have changed altogether".

00:25:31.969 --> 00:25:37.182
And within me, there is so much joy, so much peace and so much pleasure.

00:25:37.207 --> 00:25:44.238
And now there are 600 Sahajyogis.

00:25:44.263 --> 00:25:46.551
And now they had adopted Islam.

00:25:46.576 --> 00:25:49.065
I asked them, "Why did you become Muslims"?

00:25:49.090 --> 00:25:58.514
He said, "Because these French people have no morality.

00:25:58.539 --> 00:26:01.383
Morality is totally gone.

00:26:01.408 --> 00:26:09.079
So we thought, let us adopt Islam, so that atleast morality will remain  in tact".

00:26:09.104 --> 00:26:12.469
I said, in Sahajyoga all the religions are equal.

00:26:12.494 --> 00:26:14.490
And you are above all religions.

00:26:14.515 --> 00:26:18.365
No religion is disrespected. No religion is lower or higher.

00:26:18.390 --> 00:26:22.235
On the contrary, you understand your religion in a better way.

00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:25.395
You understand the depth of your religion.

00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:27.765
Till now you are wandering.

00:26:27.790 --> 00:26:33.292
You can get it, which is reality, for which this dharma has been created.

00:26:33.317 --> 00:26:38.289
Now a days, they are fighting in the name of Dharma.

00:26:38.314 --> 00:26:43.292
How is it possible? It cannot be. It is wrong.

00:26:43.317 --> 00:26:45.147
And it is the wrong thing that is being done.

00:26:45.172 --> 00:26:50.471
And I will say again that inside us, it is wickedness that is working all this.

00:26:50.496 --> 00:26:56.070
Now, even this wickedness of yours is enlightened by your kundalini  .

00:26:56.095 --> 00:27:00.480
When it passes through this chakra, which is called Agnya

00:27:00.505 --> 00:27:06.668
it enlightens it and you understand,"Oh! what was i doing"?

00:27:06.693 --> 00:27:09.310
Why was i running foolishly?

00:27:09.335 --> 00:27:11.913
What was i quarreling for?

00:27:11.938 --> 00:27:15.532
Unless you know your own self

00:27:15.557 --> 00:27:22.042
you cannot recognize truth and you will spoil your life in falsehood.

00:27:22.067 --> 00:27:24.437
You will spoil your life, your chidren's life.

00:27:24.462 --> 00:27:28.414
Not only this, but whole nation will get devastated.

00:27:28.439 --> 00:27:31.630
Many such nations are getting devastated like this.

00:27:31.655 --> 00:27:38.545
So, one thing that is in our country and which is very pure

00:27:38.570 --> 00:27:41.080
and that is the awakening of your kundalini.

00:27:41.105 --> 00:27:44.816
Now, this kundalini is your mother.

00:27:44.841 --> 00:27:51.264
Your individual mother, it is absolutely your mother.

00:27:51.289 --> 00:27:53.075
She is not the mother of anyone else.

00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:57.164
For example, your mother may have five to six, or eight to ten  chidren.

00:27:57.189 --> 00:28:00.926
Of this kundalini, only you are the son, you are the daughter.

00:28:00.951 --> 00:28:04.383
Now, when this kundalini gets awakened

00:28:04.408 --> 00:28:13.693
and when it is awakened, it knows everything about you.

00:28:13.718 --> 00:28:17.014
Inside it, is every thing recorded about you.

00:28:17.039 --> 00:28:23.200
What do you want, who were you? What are your problems?

00:28:23.225 --> 00:28:25.718
What are the problems of your body?

00:28:25.743 --> 00:28:28.495
Where, what is the problem, everything is known to it.

00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:36.554
Managing that , your mother awakens and does not give you any trouble.

00:28:36.579 --> 00:28:40.602
It is so surprising that not even a bit of trouble you will have

00:28:40.627 --> 00:28:42.487
because she is mother.

00:28:42.512 --> 00:28:47.667
When you were born, your mother took all the trouble upon herself.

00:28:47.692 --> 00:28:50.196
She didn't put you to any problem.

00:28:50.221 --> 00:28:54.734
In the same way, She is mother and when it gets awakened

00:28:54.759 --> 00:29:00.000
you do not face any trouble, there is no problem

00:29:00.025 --> 00:29:03.744
and you achieve an absolutely different state.

00:29:03.769 --> 00:29:08.140
And then it is a great surprise that you were like that.

00:29:08.165 --> 00:29:12.873
All this was within you and you had such a treasure, was totally unknown.

00:29:12.898 --> 00:29:16.014
And in every way you are benefitted.

00:29:16.039 --> 00:29:21.026
Foe example, physical, mental, intellectual and spiritual.

00:29:21.051 --> 00:29:24.429
These chakras work on all four levels.

00:29:24.454 --> 00:29:27.956
And this works out on all fronts.

00:29:27.981 --> 00:29:31.083
There is no doubt about it that after coming to Sahajyoga

00:29:31.108 --> 00:29:33.996
your health improves and everything improves.

00:29:34.021 --> 00:29:39.697
Not only this, your financial situation

00:29:39.722 --> 00:29:40.956
improves due to the blessings of Lakhshmi.

00:29:40.981 --> 00:29:45.568
In our country, all those who have become Sahajyogis

00:29:45.593 --> 00:29:49.091
most of them have improved their financial problem.

00:29:49.116 --> 00:29:53.240
Their behaviour improved, their disputes are over and every thing.

00:29:53.265 --> 00:29:56.972
Because this power is spread all around.

00:29:56.997 --> 00:30:00.944
Everywhere it pervades and is working.

00:30:00.969 --> 00:30:10.042
And with the help of this power, not only our betterment

00:30:10.067 --> 00:30:15.136
but leads to a special type of dignified life.

00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:20.621
Such a life, looking at it we say, there is such a person.

00:30:20.646 --> 00:30:23.985
We would say like this, for saints.

00:30:24.010 --> 00:30:26.654
Today there are so many people in Sahajyoga

00:30:26.679 --> 00:30:28.810
and so many have come to Sahajyoga.

00:30:28.835 --> 00:30:32.109
The reason of its spreading in so many countries is that

00:30:32.134 --> 00:30:35.587
a type of depression in all the countries

00:30:35.612 --> 00:30:42.290
a type of disappointment and secondly, lot of violence has increased.

00:30:42.315 --> 00:30:48.704
Among those who thought that it is wrong, joined Sahajyoga.

00:30:48.729 --> 00:30:53.022
They say, Sahajyoga has spread in eighty six countries.

00:30:53.047 --> 00:30:56.729
Although, I have not been to so many countries, is a fact.

00:30:56.754 --> 00:31:01.846
But, just as a seed wherever it falls, can grow into a plant

00:31:01.871 --> 00:31:05.182
in the same way, Sahajyoga has spread.

00:31:05.207 --> 00:31:10.242
It is so surprizing that people from there come to this country

00:31:10.267 --> 00:31:16.306
and even they come to Italy, but I have not yet gone to their countries.

00:31:16.331 --> 00:31:19.638
And may be I might go sometime.

00:31:19.663 --> 00:31:28.415
But their love, their mutual love and mutual mixing up

00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:33.913
one gets surprized on seeing that they have, even for one single person.

00:31:33.938 --> 00:31:36.169
Recently, when there was bomb blast in Bombay

00:31:36.194 --> 00:31:37.546
there was a boy.

00:31:37.571 --> 00:31:39.845
He would always say, Mother, "I don't want to live

00:31:39.870 --> 00:31:42.142
my mother is very bad, like this, like that".

00:31:42.167 --> 00:31:45.769
He would say so repeatedly, and that boy only died.

00:31:45.794 --> 00:31:54.619
This news spread in all the countries

00:31:54.644 --> 00:32:01.477
and all the people ran, and found out this, that.

00:32:01.502 --> 00:32:04.529
Then, there they told them that they are saints.

00:32:04.554 --> 00:32:06.254
So they said that we will give you a piece of land

00:32:06.279 --> 00:32:10.282
you cremate or bury the dead body if you want, here itself.

00:32:10.307 --> 00:32:14.643
Such people sent letters there, that I was amazed.

00:32:14.668 --> 00:32:20.692
After this, recently I saw that My brother, Baba Mama expired.

00:32:20.717 --> 00:32:22.820
He loved people very much.

00:32:22.845 --> 00:32:28.717
So many people have sent faxes, that I could not go through these till now.

00:32:28.742 --> 00:32:34.699
So much love, such good talks about him, people have written about him.

00:32:34.724 --> 00:32:36.685
I was so surprized.

00:32:36.710 --> 00:32:41.500
I wouldn't think that his love had so much got distributed among people.

00:32:41.525 --> 00:32:43.871
So many people loved him!

00:32:43.896 --> 00:32:50.594
So, this whole environment of love in which everybody loves you

00:32:50.619 --> 00:32:52.932
you too will love everybody.

00:32:52.957 --> 00:32:56.005
This is the greatest thing about Sahajyoga

00:32:56.030 --> 00:32:58.790
that the power of Sahajyoga, is the 'power of love'.

00:32:58.815 --> 00:33:03.096
And no other power can overpower it.

00:33:03.121 --> 00:33:04.925
There is no greater power than this.

00:33:04.950 --> 00:33:11.143
You are enveloped in the greatest power of love

00:33:11.168 --> 00:33:14.003
and you are always protected.

00:33:14.028 --> 00:33:20.384
Nobody can touch you, because God loves you.

00:33:20.409 --> 00:33:28.111
Who dares to go against Him? Who could be hostile to Him?

00:33:28.136 --> 00:33:30.755
We have so many examples

00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:33.665
that people say,"Mother, how was i saved, can't understand".

00:33:33.690 --> 00:33:36.379
"How did i get the blessings? i don't know".

00:33:36.404 --> 00:33:41.400
After you listen to all these things, you also feel very happy.

00:33:41.425 --> 00:33:43.902
Because they are all your brothers and sisters

00:33:43.927 --> 00:33:45.846
they are all yours.

00:33:45.871 --> 00:33:51.195
And seeing to that , it appears that the world is going to change.

00:33:51.220 --> 00:33:55.687
We will have good time, very good time.

00:33:55.712 --> 00:34:04.641
In that people will always

00:34:04.666 --> 00:34:10.716
work for a great nation, a great personality and a noble cause.

00:34:10.741 --> 00:34:12.699
This has to happen and is happening

00:34:12.724 --> 00:34:16.412
but still many people have to be transformed.

00:34:16.437 --> 00:34:18.315
Transformation is very important.

00:34:18.340 --> 00:34:20.506
and till now you are living as human beings

00:34:20.531 --> 00:34:22.879
but have even fallen to a lower level than humanity.

00:34:22.904 --> 00:34:26.819
Their transformation is very easy, achieve that.

00:34:26.844 --> 00:34:30.715
There is no other way than transformation.

00:34:30.740 --> 00:34:35.835
And that happens by kundalini awakening and by nothing else.

00:34:35.860 --> 00:34:37.208
Now if somebody asks

00:34:37.233 --> 00:34:42.924
"Mother, if we put this mike in water, will it work? No".

00:34:42.950 --> 00:34:46.227
Or, if we burn it, will it work? No!

00:34:46.252 --> 00:34:49.680
You have to reconnect it then.

00:34:49.705 --> 00:34:53.974
You don't have to pay anything, you have to give nothing

00:34:53.999 --> 00:34:56.746
but a little bit of time to yourself.

00:34:56.771 --> 00:35:01.912
And wherever is your center, go and attain more depth.

00:35:01.937 --> 00:35:07.357
Many people follow it very little, and that is why they do not grow.

00:35:07.382 --> 00:35:13.784
Unless you give collective love to it

00:35:13.809 --> 00:35:18.108
as you have to water your plants and trees

00:35:18.133 --> 00:35:23.060
the same way if you don't do so, your plant will not grow.

00:35:23.085 --> 00:35:29.016
And that is why Jesus has said, that some seeds fell on stones

00:35:29.041 --> 00:35:33.676
some seeds fell on ground and died there only.

00:35:33.701 --> 00:35:38.404
But some seeds were such which fell and remained in the fertile land

00:35:38.429 --> 00:35:40.529
sprouted and became trees.

00:35:40.554 --> 00:35:46.015
So we do not condemn any religion, nor oppose any religion.

00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:51.206
The essence of all religions is their speciality

00:35:51.231 --> 00:35:56.141
and there is such a strong connection in all these religions

00:35:56.166 --> 00:35:57.777
that will be established.

00:35:57.802 --> 00:36:07.789
A very great joyful, comfortable, such a life for you in future

00:36:07.814 --> 00:36:09.491
is ready for you.

00:36:09.516 --> 00:36:25.658
You get it, This is My eternal blessing to you!

00:36:25.683 --> 00:36:31.765
I am very sorry that I had to speak in Hindi language

00:36:31.790 --> 00:36:36.360
because most of the people understand Hindi here.

00:36:36.385 --> 00:36:41.453
And you have heard me many a times in the English language.

00:36:41.478 --> 00:36:45.961
Moreover, I found you all meditative just now enjoying

00:36:45.986 --> 00:36:48.012
the world inside your heart, I think.

00:36:48.037 --> 00:37:01.585
And it was very kind of you! Thank You!

00:37:01.610 --> 00:37:05.815
Now I want to tell you that

00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:16.592
those who don’t want their kundalini to be awakened please go out.

00:37:16.617 --> 00:37:19.781
Because this is not a pageant

00:37:19.806 --> 00:37:22.988
and those who want to go in for meditation

00:37:23.013 --> 00:37:29.365
you , in a way create problems for them.

00:37:29.390 --> 00:37:35.521
So, those who don’t want to meditate, can please go out.

00:37:35.546 --> 00:37:38.716
So, you will understand

00:37:38.741 --> 00:37:43.114
that it is not your responsibility to sit here.

00:37:43.139 --> 00:37:46.643
You have come here, it’s ok, you have listened to the lecture, it is o.k

00:37:46.668 --> 00:37:52.031
but if you don't want awakening of your kundalini, you can go out.

00:37:52.056 --> 00:38:11.370
Nobody will feel bad about that.

00:38:11.395 --> 00:38:21.680
The land on which you are sitting is very sacred land of India.

00:38:21.705 --> 00:38:25.561
Your 'Bharat Bhumi' is  'Yog Bhumi"

00:38:25.586 --> 00:38:28.284
You don't know its importance.

00:38:28.309 --> 00:38:34.716
Those who come from foreign, they on the airport itself

00:38:34.741 --> 00:38:39.864
offer 'pranams' bow down to this land and touch it.

00:38:39.889 --> 00:38:46.065
And say, –“Mother how these vibrations are flowing in this land”!

00:38:46.090 --> 00:38:50.084
You are not aware of it but be aware of it today.

00:38:50.109 --> 00:38:52.898
Once I was travelling by aeroplane.

00:38:52.923 --> 00:38:56.928
I told to my husband that, we have reached India.

00:38:56.953 --> 00:38:58.338
He asked me, "How did you know"?

00:38:58.363 --> 00:39:00.893
I told him, "Vibrations are flowing in all the directions".

00:39:00.918 --> 00:39:02.972
He enquired from the pilot.

00:39:02.997 --> 00:39:05.715
And he told him, "Yes Sir, wo have reached India".

00:39:05.740 --> 00:39:08.486
This is your India.

00:39:08.526 --> 00:39:14.591
And I have lot of respect for that person, and also recognize him

00:39:14.616 --> 00:39:16.972
who is a patriot.

00:39:16.997 --> 00:39:19.961
Patriotism is very important for us

00:39:19.986 --> 00:39:22.977
because, our country is a special country.

00:39:23.002 --> 00:39:25.307
Such a country is nowhere in world.

00:39:25.332 --> 00:39:28.374
If you have no respect for your land

00:39:28.399 --> 00:39:31.910
you cannot have your Kundalini awakening .

00:39:31.935 --> 00:39:36.110
The kundalini of whole universe is in this country.

00:39:36.135 --> 00:39:40.360
It is so surprizing, that till now you are ignorant about it.

00:39:40.385 --> 00:39:43.211
But the power of this country is great

00:39:43.236 --> 00:39:47.943
and one day, the whole world will bow down to you

00:39:47.968 --> 00:39:54.181
because we are very powerful.

00:39:54.206 --> 00:39:56.997
They will bow down with love and respect

00:39:57.022 --> 00:39:59.243
not with the might of the sword.

00:39:59.268 --> 00:40:07.448
Because the people of this country, have eaten the grains of this land.

00:40:07.473 --> 00:40:09.024
And it is in their blood.

00:40:09.049 --> 00:40:12.038
So, 'Desh Bhakti' (Patriotism) is very important for us

00:40:12.063 --> 00:40:14.739
especially for Sahajyoga.

00:40:14.764 --> 00:40:17.901
Even as much as, the people who have come from foreign countries

00:40:17.926 --> 00:40:20.534
have a great respect for India.

00:40:20.559 --> 00:40:24.466
Even they have fixed maps of India at their places

00:40:24.491 --> 00:40:28.472
and photos of the great personalities of this country

00:40:28.497 --> 00:40:29.799
have fixed in their own houses.

00:40:29.824 --> 00:40:34.141
And they respect all the Gods and Goddesses

00:40:34.166 --> 00:40:36.732
because they are residing in their chakras.

00:40:36.757 --> 00:40:45.830
So, we should understand that in a way, unless we have

00:40:45.855 --> 00:40:52.929
knowledge about the speciality of our culture and our country

00:40:52.954 --> 00:40:55.809
till then, we cannot even love our country.

00:40:55.834 --> 00:41:02.548
So, you must think that you are very lucky

00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:05.758
that you were born in this country.

00:41:05.783 --> 00:41:10.292
You are very fortunate to be in this country.

00:41:10.317 --> 00:41:12.770
This land is 'SASYA SHYAMLA' (Lush green and cropwise rich).

00:41:12.795 --> 00:41:15.726
We cannot say anything else for this country.

00:41:15.750 --> 00:41:21.297
Just now, I told you about your kundalini awakening.

00:41:21.322 --> 00:41:23.678
Every body is sitting, and nobody has gone.

00:41:23.703 --> 00:41:28.479
That means you want your realization.

00:41:28.504 --> 00:41:35.619
So this is a very good thing. And it’s very encouraging to see this.

00:41:35.644 --> 00:41:38.914
O.kay! it is very easy!

00:41:38.939 --> 00:41:42.047
You are Indians and you are sitting on this land.

00:41:42.072 --> 00:41:44.223
For you it is not difficult at all.

00:41:44.248 --> 00:41:46.613
At other places My hands break.

00:41:46.638 --> 00:41:53.501
But God has given such a speciality to Indians of spiritual life

00:41:53.526 --> 00:41:58.577
that they find no difficulty and this work is done very easily.

00:41:58.602 --> 00:42:09.477
Now, you put your both the hands towards Me.

00:42:09.502 --> 00:42:13.604
Don't close your eyes. Please don't close your eyes.

00:42:13.629 --> 00:42:26.685
Just keep both the hands towards Me.

00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:30.435
Now, please put your left hand towards Me

00:42:30.460 --> 00:42:33.984
and right hand on the top of your head.

00:42:34.009 --> 00:42:43.611
Put your left hand towards Me and right hand on the Fontanel bone

00:42:43.636 --> 00:42:49.981
above the bone which is a soft bone in the childhood.

00:42:50.006 --> 00:42:55.226
And move your hand, above, below, on both sides.

00:42:55.251 --> 00:43:03.577
And check, if there is any cool or hot breeze coming out of it.

00:43:03.602 --> 00:43:05.571
This has been called 'Spand.'

00:43:05.596 --> 00:43:12.724
Check, if there is any cool or hot breeze.

00:43:12.749 --> 00:43:18.217
Now put your right hand towards Me.

00:43:18.242 --> 00:43:21.260
I am saying 'Right' and 'Left' in English

00:43:21.285 --> 00:43:26.291
because in Hindi language, every where it is spoken in a different way.

00:43:26.316 --> 00:43:28.954
Put your right hand towards Me

00:43:28.979 --> 00:43:33.967
and with left hand check over the top of your head, bend your head.

00:43:33.992 --> 00:43:35.308
Bend your head and check.

00:43:35.333 --> 00:43:38.563
Please bend your head and see for yourself

00:43:38.588 --> 00:43:44.523
if you are getting cool breeze or hot breeze from your Fontanel bone?

00:43:44.548 --> 00:43:51.080
Check! Some feel it much higher, some feel it in different directions.

00:43:51.105 --> 00:43:54.507
But you feel it.

00:43:54.532 --> 00:43:57.117
You must experience it.

00:43:57.142 --> 00:44:02.890
It is an experience. Without experiencing, you should not believe in anything.

00:44:02.915 --> 00:44:10.201
And now put your left hand towards Me and check with your right hand

00:44:10.226 --> 00:44:19.119
that from your head, if cool or hot breeze is coming?

00:44:19.144 --> 00:44:25.450
Now, hot breeze is coming, because you have not forgiven anyone till now.

00:44:25.475 --> 00:44:30.134
You have to forgive yourself as well as others.

00:44:30.159 --> 00:44:33.683
You just say,"Mother, i have forgiven everyone

00:44:33.708 --> 00:44:35.857
and forgiven myself as well".

00:44:35.882 --> 00:44:51.135
See, you will be surprized, that cool breeze has started coming.

00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:58.593
Now, put your both the hands towards Me.

00:44:58.618 --> 00:45:00.604
Both the hands.

00:45:00.629 --> 00:45:06.012
And try to be thoughtless.

00:45:06.037 --> 00:45:08.791
Be in thoughtless awareness.

00:45:08.816 --> 00:45:14.161
Because thoughts only make us stupid.

00:45:14.186 --> 00:45:33.908
You be in thoughtless awareness.

00:45:33.933 --> 00:45:45.341
Now those who are getting cool breeze in their hands or fingers

00:45:45.366 --> 00:45:50.141
or cool or hot breeze on their palms

00:45:50.166 --> 00:45:56.369
or cool or hot breeze from head

00:45:56.394 --> 00:46:02.190

You all got realization. The whole of Delhi, imagine!

00:46:45.220 --> 00:46:49.193
Now, you have to meditate a little bit.

00:46:49.218 --> 00:46:53.434
Now for that, there are centers everywhere.

00:46:53.459 --> 00:46:58.167
You will have to meditate, for 5-10 minutes, not more than that.

00:46:58.192 --> 00:47:01.738
And after that you see your condition, how you will be.

00:47:41.591 --> 00:47:45.264
Now they want to sing a song.

00:47:45.289 --> 00:47:50.017
I had written this song in twelfth century.

00:47:50.042 --> 00:47:54.048
Even now , it is sung in villages in Marathi language.

00:47:54.073 --> 00:47:58.383
They are saying, they will sing that song.

00:47:58.408 --> 00:48:01.836
In that song, kundalini has been called as 'Amba'

00:48:01.861 --> 00:48:07.338
and it is said, "Amba get awakened".

00:48:07.363 --> 00:48:11.663
People don't know what it is!

00:48:11.688 --> 00:48:14.430
They have been singing it for the past so many years

00:48:14.455 --> 00:48:19.710
but they don't know what they are singing! what are they saying!

00:48:19.735 --> 00:48:24.617
It is such a beautiful description.

00:48:24.642 --> 00:48:31.556
God! I have cleansed myself, now awaken this 'Amba'.

00:48:31.581 --> 00:48:49.701
