00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:04.160
You praise Indians very much and I also praise with you.

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:07.680
But we have certain very bad qualities, and one of them is

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.520
that we are very extremely untidy people.

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.640
Our aesthetics are so horribly made

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.440
that we don't understand the difference between a plastic bag

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.480
and a silver jug,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.920
such jumbled up things we have.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.720
And I think I would request you to

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.880
insist on arranging things yourself,

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:31.480
because then they will pick up and learn things that it is to be done.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.600
You have to learn a lot of things from them,

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.240
but they have to also learn some things from you,

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.640
and they are very important things.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.520
Because it all makes a coefficients, it makes an atmosphere,

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.120
and a pleasing thing for the Gods.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.000
But this is the character of an Indian, Indian character,

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.800
that whatever is wrong, wherever, whatever is the condition, carry on.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.400
See no evil.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.440
Speak no evil.  It's like that.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.520
If anything is bad, let it be as it is.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.080
Let it rust, let it - absolutely till it becomes so rotten,

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.680
that it is going to fall on your head,

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.040
then you may put a little support.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.960
That's our character.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.880
We're too tolerant with everything,

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.360
and that has led us to this kind of a

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.680
incapacity to work.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.040
But if you see the ritambhara pragya, see the ritambhara pragya,

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.240
how she works,

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.840
how she beautifully does everything,

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.640
how she creates everything so beautifully.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.880
There's so much neatness if you go to a jungle,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.200
you will not find anything dirty, filthy, smelling - nothing.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.480
Everything washed up, cleaned up.

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.120
The nature works in beautiful circles.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.560
Everything works out so much beautifully,

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.760
that when we call ourselves "natural"

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.560
we should understand that ritambhara pragya is the most natural thing.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.520
And how ritambhara pragya works is with complete neatness

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.960
and complete cleanliness of the whole thing.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.280
Indians will be personally very, very clean,

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.280
extremely clean they are, no doubt.

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.200
But collectively they don't understand cleanliness.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.840
If you see their roads, if you see their

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:12.720
outside of the houses, it's all dirty.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.440
And that is what I will blame our Indian men,

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.840
you see, they are extremely

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:20.840
conscious that they are human beings.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.600
You see, we have only two races in India:

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.080
Women and men.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.800
There is no third race.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.280
Men are not supposed to do any work, inside, outside, anywhere.

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.960
They don't see to the outside of the house.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.520
Like in England I find men are

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.360
all the time doing the sweeping, swabbing, everything outside.

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.560
They do mowing of the lawn, looking after the garden, everything.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.760
Here the men will be just standing

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.920
with their hands on their waist

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.000
and ordering the wives, or if not the wife,

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.720
the servants and all that.

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.320
And whatever may be, the wife may be dominating

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:55.480
as far as money is concerned,

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.080
but all these things the man is not going to do.

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.440
He'll just give up.  He'll say:

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.640
"I am not supposed to do all these things."

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.400
That's why collectively in this country

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.800
we can never be clean people,

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.560
because our men will just sit down.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.320
They won't do anything, just they won't do anything.

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.040
Only the women are supposed to do everything,

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:16.040
and that's how our collective cleanliness is zero, absolute zero.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.560
For example, if there's a WC not working in England,

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.920
I can't think of any man who will sit down for five minutes.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.520
He'll himself do it, he'll get a plumber,

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.520
he'll do somehow or other, try to manage.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.240
Here, it's not all right - doesn't matter:

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:29.600
It's all right.

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:33.840
No, see no evil - manage.

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.680
This is how we have lived all centuries now I think,

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.880
and it's high time for all Sahaja yogis to change themselves.

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.560
Now, here there are many artists sitting in this part,

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.720
but the men are not doing anything - puja the women are doing.

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.920
And the women don't know anything how to do it,

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.640
so the whole thing can be absolutely wretched.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.800
It is not, it is a sort of a

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.200
character with us, we do this way.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.640
But otherwise we have so many qualities.

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.280
We have so many qualities, that

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.640
you can't imagine how much we have got through our traditions.

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.800
We are very humble people, we are

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.480
extremely loving, affectionate,

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.840
we'll go to any extent to serve others.

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.720
We are not cunning people, we are not meticulous, we don't calculate.

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:18.360
We are very hospitable.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.240
All these things are there, no doubt.

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.280
But these things, that we have to learn from you,

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.160
it's maybe gross, to look at it looks gross, but it's not.

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.000
Just now as you see that if it is properly done, if it is

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.280
nicely done, I mean, at least I feel very much pleased with it.

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.560
And everybody feels pleased about it.

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.560
And when somebody sees the film also, they'll be pleased to see

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.000
this find of a film where there's something sensibly

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.560
put up and everything is nicely done, care has been taken.

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:49.079
Also shows a kind of a understanding,

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.160
that this is the worship of the Adi Shakti,

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.560
and you cannot take liberties with it.

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.040
Imagine, in these ordinary temples

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.000
they spend so much money - even the walls, the doors,

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.200
the windows, everything made of silver.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.360
They do so much to create that.

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.920
But if you people miss it - the Indians, I am saying -

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.480
then it's going to be very dangerous for you.

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.200
One must understand that you cannot just play about - just:

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.720
"Mother is coming"  -  Nobody came to even call Me.

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:19.040
Somebody should have come to call Me - I just walked on Myself.

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:20.880
Here, this is not the way to behave,

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.440
and the Indians must learn these things,

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:25.280
that somebody must come to call Me!

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:26.640
After all, you see,

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.080
all these protocols they are going to learn from you,

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:30.280
from the Indians;

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.680
and if you don't have any protocol about it,

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.920
how are they going to get it?

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.440
So this is what one has to understand,

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:40.480
that as English have to learn

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:44.040
from French and French have to learn from Germans,

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.360
and Germans have to learn from,

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:48.560
say, Austrians,

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.480
or Austrians have to learn from Swiss, whatever it is.

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:52.400
It's very important,

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.480
that the Indians must learn from the Western people.

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.920
Certain things, that the way they respect their women -

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:59.600
first of all that:

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:00.960
The way they respect their women.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:02.600
Of course, one should not go to that limit

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.880
that the women just dominate, all the time.

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:06.040
I mean, American women are,

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.960
I have seen about women, they are horrible.

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.120
But still, I would say that one must learn,

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:13.520
must learn how to respect the women.

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.040
Women are human beings.

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:16.920
Your Mother is a woman,

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.080
and you must learn how to respect a woman.

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.840
And if you don't know how to respect the woman,

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:24.320
then in this country I'm sure

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:27.920
there cannot be bliss, whatever you may try.

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:29.160
So the men must learn that,

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:31.920
they must know how to talk to their sisters,

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.560
to their mothers, to their wives.

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:37.720
But if there's a woman who is dominating,

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:39.520
you see, if there's a dominating woman,

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:42.040
then she becomes a prime minister in this country.

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:43.240
That's what we are.

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:45.560
If you get a dominating woman then she can manage.

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:49.079
If she's a simple woman, she's good, she's religious,

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.400
she's submissive, then she's finished.

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:54.800
If she's dominating, then men are afraid of such women.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.520
This is very sad and that gives a very bad images.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.680
So I feel that as Ritambhara Pragya works out everything so well;

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.800
in the nature if you see how she beautifully creates everything,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
how she chooses things, how she places things,

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:09.760
how the colors change.

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:13.440
You'll never find anything loud, anything obstructing,

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:17.280
anything that is destructive, vulgar, new - nothing.

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:19.960
Find everything so beautifully done,

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:23.480
that it creates an inspiration in a human mind,

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:26.160
in a human heart which can be of a stone also.

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:28.160
Even French, you see, they get

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:30.720
inspired by Ritambhara Pragya.

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:32.800
So you can imagine people with stone hearts

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.840
can get inspired,

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:37.560
people who have very funny ideas about human beings

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:40.240
can get inspired by Ritambhara Pragya.

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:41.360
So why not

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:43.880
we, the Sahaja Yogis, should get inspiration

00:07:44.079 --> 00:07:45.360
from Ritambhara Pragya,

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:47.760
and try to make everything look

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:51.120
nice, beautiful, and must have coefficients

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:54.200
by which we can have

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:57.720
the proper channel for our vibrations.

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:01.560
And this is what I feel is lacking

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:04.160
in the coordination between East and West.

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.960
Let us give them this simple thing

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:09.000
as to understand

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:10.840
how you respect your women,

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:13.120
how you respect the aesthetics,

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:14.520
how you look after things.

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:17.280
I know in London, supposing I have to have a Puja,

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:18.600
I don't want to see these things at all.

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:22.120
On the contrary, I am enamored the way things are done - always.

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:24.480
Here also they work out, I'm not saying always,

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:26.720
but it could have been much better little bit,

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:29.040
because a film has to be done and all that.

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:30.960
But this is the trouble is that

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.080
in our everyday look,

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:35.480
outlook, we are like that.

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:37.760
You will see that everywhere you go in the villages

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:40.480
the problem is, there are bathrooms, there are WCs,

00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:41.560
but never repaired.

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:43.600
Once spoiled means spoiled once for all.

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:46.080
Telephone is spoiled, it's spoiled forever.

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:49.440
At least in America people will go and buy; they will not repair.

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:50.720
They will go and buy new one.

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:52.120
Here they will not buy new one,

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:54.760
nor they will have any replacement -

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:56.720
carry on with it throughout.

00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:00.640
That is a very bad character we have got, which we must change.

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:03.560
We should try to see everything is working all right.

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:05.120
Now, come to the Kundalini,

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:07.280
supposing the Kundalini goes out of order.

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:09.080
Are we going to give it up?

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:12.200
If one chakra is not good, are we going to give it up?

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:13.880
If there's something wrong with -

00:09:14.079 --> 00:09:15.720
that point Indians are very particular,

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:17.440
much more than the Western -

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:19.960
if the kundalini is out, they'll get after it.

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:22.720
If one chakra is out, they'll get after it, they'll clean it.

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:24.400
Because they are the roots, you see,

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:26.600
and the root doesn't bother about the beauty;

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:28.480
but the tree has to look after the beauty.

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:32.320
So this is a combination which has to be worked out properly

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:33.320
by you both.

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:35.640
And the things will work out very well, I think,

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:36.880
if you understand

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:39.880
what co-relationship you have with each other,

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:41.440
what you have to learn from them

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:44.080
and what they have to learn from you.

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:48.360
Now, today is a special day I thought of having a Puja,

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:51.680
because today is the moon - just see, in front of Me here -

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.360
and today is the day, first day, the moon is waxing.

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:58.720
In the science of Sahaja Yoga,

00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:02.680
the moon is the spirit in our heart.

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:05.240
It is the spirit in our heart,

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
meaning in Marathi "Purnantara",

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:10.120
is the spirit in our heart,

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:14.640
and it shines when the sun

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:17.720
reflects on it.

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:20.720
When the sun - the sun,

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:23.040
that is the Son of God.

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:27.600
When the Son of God reflects on the heart,

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:31.680
then the moon shines in the human heart.

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:35.080
But when it shines as a moon,

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:37.480
then Shiva Himself lifts it up

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:39.640
and puts it on His head.

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:42.040
So the human beings

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:44.079
who are

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:48.120
blessed by the Son of God,

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:50.440
who are being

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:52.280
awakened by the Son of God,

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:55.080
that is you can say that

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:57.640
it is Shri Ganesh

00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:00.200
or Lord Jesus Christ,

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:02.800
any one of them,

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:09.280
if they enlighten the heart of human beings,

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:12.080
then it becomes a shining moon.

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:14.320
And the "amavasya", the day

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:15.440
when it's the dark night,

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:19.000
is when a man is not a realized soul at all.

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:22.480
The realized soul is like the full moon.

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:23.680
Now today is the day

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:25.440
when the moon is slightly,

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:27.320
one degree less.

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:28.960
It's a important day for us

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:30.720
because this is the first day

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:32.640
when it is waxing.

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:34.960
And that is the day we have to fix up our

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:36.840
moon within ourselves,

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:39.800
that we start waxing

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:42.840
by degrees.

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:45.640
Into sixteen degrees we to go on waxing.

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:48.440
And when that happens we don't realize,

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:50.760
that there is no shining.

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:52.440
The shining is going out.

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:54.120
And we have to be careful,

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:55.720
we have to look after it,

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:57.160
and we have to work it out

00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:00.920
so that we worship that day when it starts waxing.

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:02.520
It can wax with many things.

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:05.840
You see, we have so many ways of finishing off

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:09.040
the light that God has given us in our heart,

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:10.400
that is the spirit.

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:12.120
One of them is,

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:14.120
very great one, is the thinking,

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:15.680
that we do about it.

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:18.680
The first it starts when we start thinking about it,

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:20.480
rationalizing about it.

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:22.080
You must know that when I speak,

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:24.600
I don't speak - actually these are all mantras,

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:26.040
and whatever I do,

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:27.400
I work it out in such a way

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:30.240
that what I'm saying works out within you.

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:32.920
It's the Krita Yuga, and it works out.

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:37.120
When I say that, the whole machinery gets geared up.

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:38.640
So when I say something,

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:41.960
if you start reflecting it in your mind you are gone,

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:44.800
because you are not receiving what I am trying to do.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.200
If it is a mantra,

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:48.080
that means whatever I am saying,

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:50.800
those sound waves will create

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.520
that being within you

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:54.920
that I am describing.

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:59.000
So at that time, once you start thinking about it

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:00.160
you cannot receive it,

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:02.920
because you have put a barrier of your thought.

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:05.320
So when I'm talking, just try to receive it.

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:07.240
Just say "yes, yes" inside,

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:09.320
so that you receive it within yourself.

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:12.400
So this is one of the greatest problems of today,

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:14.080
is that whatever you say

00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:15.640
everybody must answer,

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:17.560
everybody must argue,

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:18.600
everybody must say,

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:20.360
"No, this could be that way, that could be,

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:23.120
there are alternatives, this, that"  -  everything goes on.

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:26.280
There is no need at all to do all that.

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:27.880
And when you start doing that,

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:30.800
then all the Gods and Goddesses get angry one by one,

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.560
and that's how you start losing your light within yourself.

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:37.400
So this is the most displeasing thing

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:38.600
for Gods and Goddesses,

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:40.760
that you don't recognize Me.

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:43.000
That you don't recognize Me fully.

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:45.040
That you still argue with Me.

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:47.240
Still you start asking questions.

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:49.840
Still you start giving Me alternatives.

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:53.720
Absolutely, this is just not necessary

00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:56.760
for you to go on arguing,

00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:58.200
to go on discussing it.

00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:00.120
It is just that you assimilate

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:01.480
whatever I am saying,

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:03.720
and that assimilation itself

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:07.040
will open out those new dimensions within you,

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:10.200
which God wants to be opened out.

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:13.600
So better surrender in that way your ego.

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:16.400
Ego is the one that makes you say something,

00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:19.360
argue something, discuss something.

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:22.320
And this is what is the biggest problem,

00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:23.440
what that I have seen

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:25.920
when the first day of the waxing starts.

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:29.440
So today is the first day when we should say that,

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:33.680
that our ego should not start that drooping down.

00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:36.720
It was nice to dance, enjoy, everything,

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:38.280
but then when you sit down -

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:41.200
while dancing you can't think, thank God!

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:45.080
But as soon as the whole thing is over you sit down,

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:48.800
again the mind starts going on "tack, tack, tack, tack"

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.400
and then we start thinking.

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:52.120
And once we start thinking,

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:55.080
then we are losing that light which we have received.

00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:58.000
Sort of, the moon has started waxing.

00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:01.040
And that point one has to be careful,

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:03.120
because that's the most important thing.

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:07.400
If you do not allow it to happen first time,

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:10.000
then it can stop.

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:12.120
It's very simple to understand

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:14.720
that if you can stop

00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:18.480
a sari or a last bit of it,

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:19.640
it will not blown off,

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:21.400
because you are holding onto it.

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:25.240
So at the very beginning of waxing of the moon,

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:27.240
if you are careful about it,

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:28.480
if you are alert about it,

00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:30.840
it will never happen; whatever you have achieved

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:33.079
will be sustained, and then you can increase.

00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:35.920
But that's the very important point which we miss,

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:38.400
and that's why we have lots of trouble

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:40.760
and lots of problems in Sahaja Yoga.

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:44.840
So now as you are moving for your further journey,

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:47.120
so many of you have come for the first time,

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:49.560
I have to tell you:   Don't think!

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:52.280
Don't reflect!

00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:54.160
In this you must learn from Indians.

00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:57.160
They don't think about these things.

00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:59.600
But they have to think, because when they think

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:02.160
they'll start thinking about gross things which they have to think.

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:03.640
I mean you don't think.

00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:05.840
You'll be giving up all that is nonsensical

00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:07.600
that you have been thinking about.

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:09.120
So don't think about it,

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:11.160
don't reflect, don't bother!

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:13.240
Try to be subtler and subtler

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:15.960
and not misidentified with your tags

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:18.320
that are outside - like hooks, you see.

00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:19.760
And the mind is like a hook.

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:21.640
I have seen all of you have some

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:22.680
one hook outside

00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:25.200
and all the yarns go, hook around it,

00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:28.240
again another yarn goes and hooks around it.

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:30.840
And the whole mind is attached to that hook,

00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:32.520
that is Mr. Ego.

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:34.880
If you can cut your strings somehow or other

00:16:35.079 --> 00:16:36.400
and say, "I'm not going to think.

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:39.080
I have come here for my spiritual ascent.

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:40.720
Let me be what I am.

00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:43.480
If Mother says something I'll listen to it.

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:45.680
She scolds me, I'll listen to it, She does something,

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:47.480
whatever She does, let me see

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:51.920
that, as I have come here for chiseling out myself,

00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:54.880
let Her chisel me out, let the nature chisel me out,

00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:56.960
let the whole atmosphere chisel me out,

00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:58.640
Puja should chisel me out."

00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:03.360
But you just become like a beautiful,

00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:05.000
we can say a

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:08.200
jade in the hands of the Divine,

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:09.720
and allow the Divine

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:11.320
to take out all your beauty.

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:13.680
Just allow the Divine to take out your beauty,

00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:15.520
and then you can enjoy your beauty.

00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:17.680
But if you hand over to all these old things,

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:19.600
then it will be very difficult.

00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:21.160
So as being the first day,

00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:24.000
I have started it on the day

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:27.320
when the moon is about to wax, you see.

00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:30.079
I hope you'll be all very careful about it.

00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:32.000
Be alert!   You have to be very alert.

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:33.560
You have to go beyond time.

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:34.760
You don't have to think about food.

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:36.520
Once in a while if you don't eat, doesn't matter.

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:38.240
Nobody is going to die.   I tell you!

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:40.920
We don't eat for days together, nothing happens to us.

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:42.480
So food has not come,

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:44.760
the breakfast time, the dinner time -

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:48.000
I mean, there food is a religion, I think,

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:49.520
so everything has a time.

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:51.640
Here there is no time for anything.

00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:53.560
We'll do whenever we feel like, you see?

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:55.040
Let's do that way.

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:59.360
So we have to be prepared for a nice thorough cleansing,

00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:02.480
and a very enjoyable time throughout.

00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:04.960
These two things can work hand in hand,

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:06.360
if you just accept

00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:07.760
that you don't have to think.

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:10.600
If you don't think, everything can be done

00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:14.200
without any problem, and you'll enjoy life very much.

00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:16.040
So that's one thing.
