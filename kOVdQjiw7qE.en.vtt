07:57.984 --> 08:08.557
Today we are here to worship Shri Krishna within us.

08:13.659 --> 08:22.550
As you know, that you all have been seeking
before coming to Sahaja Yoga.

08:26.727 --> 08:41.954
You went to different places, read lots of
books, and also some of you were lost.

08:42.827 --> 08:49.795
And in that seeking, perhaps you did not know
what you were seeking.

08:52.049 --> 08:58.174
What you were seeking was to know yourself.

08:58.677 --> 09:03.149
In all religions it is said “Know thyself.”

09:03.332 --> 09:06.160
It’s a common thing all of them have said.

09:06.398 --> 09:13.128
This is one point which is absolutely there
in every religion, “Know thyself” –

09:13.295 --> 09:19.054
because without knowing yourself you will not know God.

09:19.247 --> 09:21.700
You will not know spirituality.

09:21.842 --> 09:26.057
So the first step was to know yourself,

09:26.350 --> 09:32.416
and that one people did all kinds of tricks with you,
they taught you in a different ways

09:32.623 --> 09:39.458
and tried to actually loot you and cheat you.

09:39.609 --> 09:42.524
All those things have happened, is finished.

09:42.807 --> 09:50.687
So then you come to Sahaja Yoga and you get
your Self-realization.

09:51.310 --> 10:03.898
Well, what is the purpose of Self-realization
is to know God, or the Goddess;

10:04.256 --> 10:09.515
that is the purpose of Self-realization.

10:10.689 --> 10:17.973
But after getting Self-realization, what should
happen to you?

10:18.886 --> 10:26.570
Many of you have lost interest in nonsensical
things like drugs and all those things;

10:26.797 --> 10:34.444
you have lost interest in reading also useless
books; you have lost interest

10:34.469 --> 10:38.036
in other habits like drinking and all that.

10:38.351 --> 10:42.466
But that’s not enough, that’s not enough.

10:42.466 --> 10:46.748
That would happen in anyway.

10:46.976 --> 10:53.463
What has to happen by knowing God, is that
why does God wants you to know Him?

10:53.545 --> 10:58.695
Because He wants to see His reflection in you.

10:58.926 --> 11:05.127
He wants to see His reflection, that’s why
He has created you, and He wants to see His

11:05.127 --> 11:06.407
reflection in you.

11:06.407 --> 11:08.196
Same with the Goddess.

11:08.196 --> 11:19.396
She has given you Self-realization because
She wants to see Her reflection in you.

11:19.396 --> 11:37.246
So you have to prepare yourself for that reflection,
which is so much purer, beautiful, loving,

11:37.246 --> 11:46.386
compassionate and above all, full of wisdom.

11:46.386 --> 11:54.196
So this is the point one has to reach, where
you understand you have to have wisdom.

11:54.196 --> 12:02.106
If you are lacking in wisdom then you are
not a self-realized person.

12:03.267 --> 12:12.577
At the level of Shri Krishna, you see, He
wants you to become one part and parcel of

12:12.577 --> 12:20.017
the Virata – or the Viratangana, also wants
the same thing, that you should become part

12:20.017 --> 12:24.767
and parcel of the Virata.

12:24.767 --> 12:30.937
Not because you are realized souls now, so
you go about thinking you are perfectly all

12:30.937 --> 12:35.387
right, you don’t have to do anything about
it.

12:35.387 --> 12:46.207
What do you do beyond this is the point, that
after Self-realization you have to see the

12:46.207 --> 12:59.348
reflection that should be within you from
the lives of these people like Shri Krishna.

12:59.348 --> 13:11.157
Shri Krishna was first born in a very difficult
situation, as you know, and He was carried

13:11.157 --> 13:17.487
from there to Gokul, where He was brought
up by Yeshoda.

13:17.487 --> 13:26.137
Now there He started His playfulness.

13:26.137 --> 13:33.717
So you have to be playful in life, you have
to create fun and joy.

13:33.717 --> 13:42.797
He didn’t say that you sit down like a old
sage somewhere in the Himalayas, but you mix

13:42.797 --> 13:50.187
up with children, you talk to them, you play
with them, have fun.

13:50.187 --> 13:57.477
At the same time He was destroying negative
forces which acted upon Him.

13:57.477 --> 14:02.937
In His playfulness only He has done it, as
a child only He has done it.

14:02.937 --> 14:10.027
How matured He was as a child you can see,
that He killed the Putana, and there are two

14:10.027 --> 14:13.928
horrible rakshasas also, He killed them.

14:14.500 --> 14:19.350
At the same time He was playing with the gopis

14:19.414 --> 14:25.511
and teasing them, troubling them, making fun of them.

14:26.837 --> 14:28.034
Why?

14:28.059 --> 14:39.029
Because He wanted them to be playful; and
all kinds of celebrations He arranged.

14:39.087 --> 14:48.577
He had once a big rain came, and He lifted
the complete mountain on His fingertips.

14:48.577 --> 14:54.747
That time these people should have understood,
it’s not possible, it’s a miracle.

14:54.747 --> 15:04.887
But He was just standing there with the one
finger at the mountain in a very simple, unassuming

15:04.887 --> 15:13.147
manner; He was doing all that to protect all
the boys who were playing with Him.

15:13.147 --> 15:22.897
Then He went and killed Kaaliya, the one who
was a big snake in the water.

15:22.897 --> 15:30.907
In the water this horrible fellow was creating
venom, and by which many people were killed.

15:30.907 --> 15:44.497
It took Him no time and He jumped inside that
horrible water of Yamuna, from where He rescued

15:44.497 --> 15:54.277
in a way all the people by killing or hitting,
or you can say that by winning over this Kaaliya.

15:54.277 --> 15:59.364
But the wives of the big serpent, they asked Him

15:59.389 --> 16:04.753
that “Please forgive him,” and He forgave.

16:04.967 --> 16:13.377
All these things show a child of six, seven
years doing all these great things without

16:13.377 --> 16:20.257
feeling what He was doing, we can say that
without even thinking about it.

16:20.257 --> 16:27.097
But He achieved it, because He was aware that
He was Shri Krishna.

16:27.097 --> 16:33.127
So first thing, you have to be aware that
you are self-realized people.

16:33.127 --> 16:42.866
You are not ordinary people to behave in an
ordinary way, you are special people made

16:42.866 --> 16:49.847
specially to reflect the qualities of God
Almighty.

16:49.847 --> 16:55.796
It’s not expected that you go and kill Kaaliya.

16:55.796 --> 17:03.497
But the situation is such today that you are
all the time protected.

17:03.497 --> 17:06.606
You are all the time protected.

17:06.606 --> 17:11.637
No one can harm you, no one can kill you,

17:12.017 --> 17:18.966
and you can be looked after
because you are Sahaja yogis.

17:22.426 --> 17:26.775
Now what should be the attitude of a Sahaja yogi

17:26.949 --> 17:31.322
towards taking decisions, one should understand.

17:31.647 --> 17:40.256
It should be a spontaneous decision.

17:40.256 --> 17:45.967
You don’t have to tally it with this, go
there and find out – immediately, spontaneous,

17:45.967 --> 17:53.337
like Shri Krishna who jumped inside the river.

17:53.337 --> 17:59.607
So in the same way you should have a very
spontaneous decision for anything.

17:59.607 --> 18:01.806
Now you want to buy, say, a carpet.

18:01.806 --> 18:02.806
All right.

18:02.806 --> 18:09.066
You go in the shop and immediately you should
know which is the one.

18:09.066 --> 18:16.306
In every walk of life you should have a very
spontaneous decision, instant decision.

18:16.306 --> 18:21.767
But what I find, the style is very different.

18:21.767 --> 18:29.806
They’ll go from shop to shop, then make
a list of it, then make all the measurements,

18:29.806 --> 18:35.186
then go home and say that “We’ll decide
it tomorrow.”

18:35.186 --> 18:40.087
That’s not the way a Sahaja yogi behaves.

18:40.087 --> 18:47.472
Sahaja yogi has to decide everything absolutely
spontaneously, at that moment.

18:49.147 --> 18:55.163
You should be like this: now somebody is getting drowned,

18:55.260 --> 19:00.031
so the first impulse should be that you have to save.

19:00.587 --> 19:04.107
And how do you save?

19:05.660 --> 19:11.046
You jump in the water – because you are
protected, nothing can happen to you,

19:11.161 --> 19:15.390
so just jump in the water and you’ll save the person.

19:15.747 --> 19:21.806
Minimum of minimum this should be your attitude,
this should be your temperament, that you

19:21.806 --> 19:25.967
take a very spontaneous decision.

19:25.967 --> 19:36.996
All this thinking and all kinds of decision-making,
and having a big conference for decisions

19:36.996 --> 19:41.176
and all that – not needed.

19:41.176 --> 19:50.306
In day-to-day life also you have to be like
that.

19:50.306 --> 19:58.626
Also in every political life, economic life
or any other life you have to lead, you have

19:58.626 --> 20:04.027
to be very spontaneous.

20:04.027 --> 20:08.447
How do you become spontaneous?

20:08.447 --> 20:09.447
What quality you have got?

20:09.447 --> 20:17.296
What is the weapon you have got, to know what
decision to take?

20:17.296 --> 20:20.406
Do you know?

20:20.406 --> 20:26.366
You have got vibrations, you have the feel of the vibrations,

20:26.580 --> 20:30.277
and you know what vibrations are.

20:30.277 --> 20:35.796
You know what vibrations tell you, and convey
and communicate to you.

20:35.796 --> 20:38.236
They speak to you.

20:38.236 --> 20:47.366
So through your vibrations you should know
in a second what should you do.

20:47.366 --> 20:53.207
For example now, somebody told Me that “Mother,
when I came to Cabella I felt tremendous vibrations.”

20:53.207 --> 20:55.197
It’s a fact.

20:55.197 --> 21:00.277
But how many of you feel that way?

21:00.277 --> 21:05.217
Because your sensitivity is not yet developed.

21:05.217 --> 21:09.806
You have to be sensitive about your vibrations.

21:09.806 --> 21:17.356
You should know looking at anyone, sitting
next to anyone, even shaking hands with anyone,

21:17.356 --> 21:25.157
you should know what sort of vibrations that
person has.

21:25.157 --> 21:28.077
This kind of sensitivity if you develop,

21:28.164 --> 21:32.267
then you will definitely take a very spontaneous decision.

21:32.267 --> 21:36.756
You know I am very good at it.

21:36.756 --> 21:44.506
I bought this Cabella in five minutes, really
five minutes.

21:44.506 --> 21:50.116
When I came here they said, “You can’t
go up, because You have big car.”

21:50.116 --> 21:53.907
So the Mayor said, “All right, come along,
I’ll take You in my car.”

21:53.907 --> 21:58.837
So I went with him on the car, on that car,
and I saw it.

21:58.837 --> 22:01.286
It was all dilapidated, no doubt.

22:01.286 --> 22:11.616
It was all absolutely in a shambles, all right,
and looked like a ghostly place, no doubt.

22:11.616 --> 22:16.777
And everybody who was with Me, they said,
“Ah, what a place, Mother!

22:16.777 --> 22:19.357
You can’t buy that.”

22:19.357 --> 22:22.216
So I told the Mayor, “I am buying it.”

22:22.216 --> 22:23.267
“When?”

22:23.267 --> 22:24.316
“Today.

22:24.316 --> 22:25.366
Now!”

22:25.366 --> 22:26.366
He was amazed.

22:26.366 --> 22:29.996
I said, “You tell Me, how do I buy?”

22:29.996 --> 22:31.796
He said, “Very easy.

22:31.796 --> 22:39.716
In this Italy You have to buy like this, that
You pay one-third of the price, all right?

22:39.716 --> 22:42.006
And then You can occupy.

22:42.006 --> 22:47.857
If You find something wrong with the place
You can give up, but then You’ll not get

22:47.857 --> 22:48.857
Your money.

22:48.857 --> 22:53.066
But if the other fellow who is selling You
says no, then he has to pay double.”

22:53.066 --> 22:55.216
I said, “Very good bargain.

22:55.216 --> 22:56.216
I am buying.

22:56.216 --> 22:57.556
I have told you I am buying.

22:57.556 --> 22:59.637
I’ll buy.”

22:59.637 --> 23:03.916
And everybody was surprised what Mother was
doing.

23:03.916 --> 23:08.537
So what decided was the vibrations.

23:08.537 --> 23:10.827
Vibrations of the place just decided.

23:10.827 --> 23:12.116
I said, “Buy it.”

23:12.116 --> 23:18.186
That way they took Me to seven, I think, castles;
I said no.

23:18.186 --> 23:23.737
Outside only I could say no, and they were
surprised I didn’t even go inside.

23:23.737 --> 23:26.666
I said, “Ask them what was here.”

23:26.666 --> 23:28.936
They said, “Nunnery.”

23:28.936 --> 23:31.207
I said, “See?”

23:31.207 --> 23:35.476
Now you should develop that kind of a spontaneous
decision.

23:35.476 --> 23:47.957
Then you will be amazed how in such a short
time you can really achieve such great things.

23:51.147 --> 23:55.642
But that doesn’t mean that you all should do that way;

23:55.667 --> 23:59.827
first you should have that sensitivity of vibrations.

23:59.827 --> 24:02.620
If you have that sensitivity of vibrations,

24:02.652 --> 24:08.143
then I would say you are now matured in Sahaja Yoga.

24:08.483 --> 24:11.732
So the maturity has to be brought in.

24:12.169 --> 24:18.230
You cannot just say, “Now it’s all right,
I have got Self-realization, I can do this.”

24:18.230 --> 24:23.330
First you tally your sense of sensitivity.

24:23.330 --> 24:28.469
So now, how do you know?

24:28.469 --> 24:37.239
For example, you take a spontaneous decision,
you find that you have got nothing, it’s

24:37.239 --> 24:40.199
all nonsense – possible.

24:40.199 --> 24:47.919
But you can see for yourself that your decisions,
if they are spontaneous: if they fail, if

24:47.919 --> 24:59.270
they are wrong, if there are some mistakes
or that will make you suffer, whether economically,

24:59.270 --> 25:08.880
politically, in every way, then your whole
value system will be judged very well how

25:08.880 --> 25:21.090
far you have gone into Sahaja Yoga, how far
you have achieved your Self-realization, and

25:21.090 --> 25:27.280
where are you.

25:27.280 --> 25:30.000
This is what is the way to test yourself.

25:30.000 --> 25:38.850
You should not be afraid of failures, and
not get enamored by success, because you are

25:38.850 --> 25:40.380
self-realized souls.

25:40.380 --> 25:47.780
Of course, if you are sensitive, immediately
you will know what is it.

25:48.676 --> 25:51.637
Now of course, I wouldn’t say that

25:51.668 --> 25:55.530
you could have the same as I have, but you should try it.

25:55.530 --> 26:03.370
Now, I have seen some people will praise some
man, “Oh Mother, he’s so good.

26:03.370 --> 26:05.020
You must meet him.

26:05.020 --> 26:12.620
He’s such a nice person and he’s of such
a help, and this will happen and that will

26:12.620 --> 26:13.620
happen.”

26:13.620 --> 26:17.900
I said, “All right, you show Me a photograph.”

26:17.900 --> 26:24.287
I said, “I am sorry, I don’t want to meet
him.”

26:24.577 --> 26:27.397
They can’t understand.

26:27.397 --> 26:31.097
“Such a great man, he’ll be a minister
tomorrow.”

26:31.097 --> 26:34.513
“I don’t want to meet him.”

26:34.603 --> 26:40.913
And you find immediately, just next day, a
big report about him in the newspaper that

26:40.913 --> 26:45.943
he’s a very bad man.

26:45.943 --> 26:55.883
So you must tally your experience and your
understanding of what you have decided spontaneously.

26:55.883 --> 27:01.123
But still I would say, keep to spontaneous
decisions.

27:01.123 --> 27:08.683
Don’t think about it how it should work
out, what should we do.

27:08.683 --> 27:22.703
It has a very far-fetched influence on your
mind also that you see, that you know what

27:22.703 --> 27:25.413
is right and what is wrong.

27:25.413 --> 27:29.053
I don’t know how many of you have seen the
house I have built.

27:29.053 --> 27:37.733
The another side of Shri Krishna was that
He was extremely creative.

27:37.733 --> 27:45.243
In His childhood He did all these things,
these pranks, and when He became a grown-up

27:45.243 --> 27:50.863
person He became the king of Dwarika, of that
area.

27:50.863 --> 27:56.163
And He used to dress up like a king only – after
all, He was a king.

27:56.163 --> 28:06.643
When He was a child He used to wear a small
little piece of a feather from the peacock,

28:06.643 --> 28:12.883
but when He became the king He was wearing
all the things, and He used to sit on the

28:12.883 --> 28:16.803
throne and talk to people in that manner.

28:16.803 --> 28:24.523
All that greatness was there, and He was extremely
creative.

28:24.523 --> 28:34.543
He built a beautiful, very, very beautiful
castle or you can say, palace in Dwarika,

28:34.543 --> 28:38.583
out of gold – can you believe it?

28:38.583 --> 28:41.203
Shri Krishna did it.

28:41.203 --> 28:44.293
And it was all then covered with water.

28:44.293 --> 28:50.593
Now the intellectuals in India, all trained
by Western people I think, said that it’s

28:50.593 --> 28:57.863
not possible, there’s nothing in the water
and He never built His palace there; it’s

28:57.863 --> 29:05.443
all a story just, just like a myth.

29:05.443 --> 29:09.653
But some people believed in it, and they dug
up.

29:09.653 --> 29:14.493
They went down and they found there was a
very big palace.

29:14.493 --> 29:18.633
There was gold little bit left, but not all
of it was there.

29:18.633 --> 29:26.073
And they were amazed, such a huge, big palace
He had made.

29:26.073 --> 29:31.563
Under the water it had gone, but it was there.

29:31.563 --> 29:39.463
Like this, all these incarnations who came
were extremely creative.

29:39.463 --> 29:44.183
If you are not creative, what’s the use
of Self-realization?

29:44.183 --> 29:50.303
Now, what is the greatest creative thing you
can do very easily is

29:50.528 --> 29:54.501
to make others Sahaja yogis.

29:55.173 --> 30:07.363
That is the easiest and most joy-giving thing,
is to make others Sahaja yogis and give them

30:07.363 --> 30:16.053
the blessings of the Divine, which they have
been seeking for ages.

30:16.053 --> 30:23.393
By giving them, you don’t know what a solace,
what a blessing you give.

30:23.393 --> 30:30.964
So now when you have got your Self-realization
– you got it very easily, I must say; they

30:30.964 --> 30:41.233
all say that it is a instant nirvana, Sahaja
Yoga is instant nirvana, it’s true – but

30:41.233 --> 30:48.693
whatever you get so easily and instantly,
you don’t understand the value of that.

30:48.693 --> 30:54.403
They always say for India that they got their
freedom so easily; they didn’t get it that

30:54.403 --> 30:55.903
easily, that’s why they do not value it.

30:55.903 --> 31:08.713
But it is true, if you get anything free firstly
and without any special effort, then you don’t

31:08.713 --> 31:10.773
value it, you don’t understand.

31:10.773 --> 31:12.293
You think it’s a matter of right.

31:12.293 --> 31:16.843
But do you know how much people have suffered
for getting Self-realization?

31:16.843 --> 31:24.803
They used to go on the Himalayas, stand on
one leg, sometimes on their heads for months

31:24.803 --> 31:30.293
together, and they didn’t get realization.

31:30.293 --> 31:39.883
I have heard of some people who lived in a
room for twenty-eight years to get Self-realization.

31:39.883 --> 31:44.213
And why they lived like that?

31:44.213 --> 31:50.923
Because they thought by keeping away from
other people, other bad atmosphere, everything,

31:50.923 --> 31:52.643
they might get realization.

31:52.643 --> 31:56.963
They never got it.

31:56.963 --> 32:00.970
So one must understand, though you have got
it very easily,

32:00.995 --> 32:07.923
it’s something so precious, so great.

32:08.053 --> 32:13.423
It’s not very easy to get Self-realization.

32:13.423 --> 32:23.553
You read about the people who are self-realized.

32:23.553 --> 32:28.433
Perhaps they did not even know how they got
it, they did not know even about the kundalini,

32:28.433 --> 32:34.893
but they got it, through their guru maybe,
maybe their efforts.

32:34.893 --> 32:43.273
Buddha, how much He had to suffer till He
gets His realization – think of Him, how

32:43.273 --> 32:45.873
He got His realization.

32:45.873 --> 32:55.943
I mean, you shudder to see of His life: ultimately
dies of hunger and poverty.

32:55.943 --> 32:59.093
But nothing happened to you.

32:59.093 --> 33:06.493
You have got it without any difficulties,
in a very sweet manner, all of you.

33:06.493 --> 33:10.573
Nothing – you don’t have to pay, you don’t
have to do anything about it.

33:10.573 --> 33:18.203
But that doesn’t mean you should not value
it.

33:18.203 --> 33:30.733
Like a seed which is put in the Mother Earth
spontaneously sprouts and gives life to the

33:30.733 --> 33:40.253
primule which grows, can grow into a shrub
and then into a tree.

33:40.253 --> 33:49.563
But you have to put water in, and you have
to have the care of a gardener or someone.

33:49.563 --> 33:56.543
In your case, you are the one who has to do
all that.

33:56.543 --> 34:06.633
First of all you have to put the nourishment
of compassion and love.

34:06.633 --> 34:09.753
Have you got that compassion and love?

34:09.753 --> 34:13.873
Do you love people?

34:13.873 --> 34:17.973
Like somebody told Me today – I was shocked
– “I don’t like children.”

34:17.973 --> 34:19.893
I said, “You don’t like children?”

34:19.893 --> 34:22.043
“No, I like others’ children, not mine.”

34:22.043 --> 34:30.673
Just imagine, how can you be doing that?

34:30.673 --> 34:35.763
How can you say such a thing, you don’t
like your own children, anything?

34:35.763 --> 34:43.623
First of all, for all of you I would say that
you should never say “I like” and “I

34:43.623 --> 34:44.763
don’t like.”

34:44.763 --> 34:46.463
These are anti-mantras.

34:46.463 --> 34:49.873
“I like this” – it’s very common.

34:49.873 --> 34:51.573
Who are you?

34:51.573 --> 34:53.853
“I don’t like this carpet.

34:53.853 --> 34:55.823
I don’t like that silver thing.”

34:55.823 --> 34:58.933
Who are you?

34:58.933 --> 35:01.923
Can you make one like that?

35:03.534 --> 35:07.019
To take a decision of that kind is also shows

35:07.057 --> 35:11.208
they think it’s very spontaneous – it’s not.

35:11.233 --> 35:15.975
It has come from your conditioning, that you
think you have a right to say “I don’t

35:16.115 --> 35:18.183
like, I don’t want.”

35:18.183 --> 35:22.183
But who are you?

35:22.183 --> 35:29.213
If you are the spirit you’ll never use these
words, because it might hurt somebody.

35:29.213 --> 35:37.923
You’ll never say something that will hurt
others, you’ll never do anything that will

35:37.923 --> 35:46.093
be dangerous for others; but always you’ll
say something that would be extremely loving

35:46.093 --> 35:48.293
and compassionate, and peace-giving.

35:48.293 --> 35:55.893
You will emit joy for others.

35:55.893 --> 36:04.313
There is the power of spirit, that it gives
joy to others.

36:04.313 --> 36:09.993
If you are a glum person, grumpy person, then
you are not self-realized.

36:09.993 --> 36:16.127
You should be able to give joy and love and compassion,

36:16.238 --> 36:22.428
and it should happen absolutely spontaneously.

36:24.833 --> 36:36.243
There’s a story about a saint in India,
in Maharashtra.

36:36.243 --> 36:45.573
So they all used to take water in a container
called as kanwar, and would take it all the

36:45.573 --> 36:50.903
way to Gujarat, to a temple of Shri Krishna.

36:50.903 --> 36:58.243
That was regarded as a great, you can say,
surrendering to Shri Krishna.

36:58.243 --> 37:03.853
So that saint also carried water in that container,
this kanwar.

37:03.853 --> 37:14.933
All the way he carried it from his village
in Maharashtra, and when he reached the temple,

37:14.933 --> 37:28.783
at the foot of that temple he saw a donkey
very thirsty, dying out of thirst.

37:28.783 --> 37:35.553
So he gave that water to that donkey.

37:35.553 --> 37:39.743
Everybody said, “Imagine, you brought this
water for miles together, for days together

37:39.743 --> 37:48.013
to be put on the deity here, and now you have
given it to this donkey.”

37:48.013 --> 37:57.153
He said, “You don’t know, God has come
all the way down here to take the water.”

37:57.153 --> 38:02.633
See the attitude that he took.

38:02.633 --> 38:11.903
So for a self-realized person the compassion
should be like that, of very generous nature.

38:11.903 --> 38:19.203
If you are not generous, if you are miserly,
always worried about your money and saving

38:19.203 --> 38:27.983
of it, then firstly you are not a matured
Sahaja yogi – you are not.

38:27.983 --> 38:34.403
Apart from that, this kind of money will never
give you any happiness.

38:34.403 --> 38:38.043
Miserliness is against spirit.

38:38.043 --> 38:44.043
Spirit is extremely generous, extremely generous.

38:44.043 --> 38:58.193
It never strives to save something, or cheat
people or steal something – is out of question;

38:58.193 --> 39:04.233
because there is no greed left in it, there
is no greed at all.

39:04.233 --> 39:11.883
And that is why such a person who is a realized
soul cannot be greedy,

39:12.112 --> 39:15.038
has to be extremely generous.

39:15.063 --> 39:24.143
I have seen many people like that who have
been extremely generous, and who have been

39:24.143 --> 39:28.803
very understanding about the problems of others.

39:28.803 --> 39:34.993
While a Sahaja yogi will have his own problems,
he is not a Sahaja yogi at all.

39:34.993 --> 39:43.663
He is there to solve the problems of others,
and not to solve his own problems and go about

39:43.663 --> 39:45.943
talking about it, “This is the problem I
have.”

39:45.943 --> 39:49.433
Now this is a new word that has developed
in modern times.

39:49.433 --> 39:55.003
They never used to use the word “problem”
before, I tell you; only for geometry we used

39:55.003 --> 39:56.703
this word “problem.”

39:56.703 --> 39:59.793
But now it has started with a … “There’s
no problem.”

39:59.793 --> 40:06.783
They are all in a problem, actually they are
problems, I think.

40:06.783 --> 40:13.613
So what you have to do is to understand that
you should not give your problems to others.

40:13.613 --> 40:20.533
You should not ask for anything, “Please
do this for me, please do that for me.”

40:20.533 --> 40:33.053
It’s very surprising that people try to
sort of take advantage of others.

40:33.053 --> 40:38.153
Now some people like to visit some countries,
so they will ask you, “Please call me.

40:38.153 --> 40:40.914
I would love to come to your country,”

40:40.986 --> 40:44.608
and a generous Sahaja yogi will say, “All right, come along.”

40:45.986 --> 40:50.573
Now, who is failing here is the person who
asked.

40:50.573 --> 40:58.563
You shouldn’t ask for anything whatsoever,
because you are complete.

40:58.563 --> 41:01.092
Not that only you are satisfied, but are complete.

41:01.092 --> 41:07.503
What can anybody give you?

41:07.503 --> 41:11.842
All desires just disappear when you are in
complete shape.

41:11.842 --> 41:15.433
Like today I was coming, I saw lots of stars
had come out.

41:15.433 --> 41:20.253
I said, “As soon as the moon will come,
they’ll all disappear.”

41:20.253 --> 41:33.973
In the same way, when you are complete, you
do not expect anybody to do anything for you.

41:33.973 --> 41:39.663
On the contrary, you want to find out what
you can do for others.

41:39.663 --> 41:43.131
You become the others, in a way that whatever

41:43.157 --> 41:46.477
is the problem of others you take upon yourhead.

41:48.303 --> 41:51.483
You jump into it.

41:51.483 --> 41:59.653
It’s a very, very interesting growth that
should come in you.

41:59.653 --> 42:08.533
It should happen to all of you, because you
have got your Self-realization.

42:08.533 --> 42:16.063
You develop a kind of a personality which
only lives for others, not for oneself.

42:16.063 --> 42:20.963
You will be amazed: you can live anywhere,
you can sleep anywhere.

42:20.963 --> 42:25.123
You can have food, you need not have food,
whatever type of food you get it’s all right,

42:25.123 --> 42:31.733
because you are so satisfied.

42:31.733 --> 42:39.743
On the contrary, you’d like to cook for
others, give them food, do whatever you like

42:39.743 --> 42:42.663
possible, you try to do.

42:42.663 --> 42:51.063
As long as you can work it out, you do it.

42:51.063 --> 42:56.913
But there are people who have only their own
problems.

42:56.913 --> 42:58.993
They are not Sahaja yogis.

42:58.993 --> 43:06.923
How can the spirit have problems?

43:06.923 --> 43:11.123
How can that happen?

43:11.123 --> 43:20.473
So just understand that you are now the spirit,
and beyond everything.

43:20.473 --> 43:26.813
So your creativity also goes to other dimensions.

43:26.813 --> 43:31.473
Of course you start giving realization to
people.

43:31.473 --> 43:33.993
You create art.

43:33.993 --> 43:39.778
You know Baba Mama, he was very bad at literature and he was – well,

43:39.833 --> 43:41.869
he didn’t know any language.

43:41.909 --> 43:46.769
He was very good for mathematics, because
My mother was a mathematician, but language

43:47.063 --> 43:48.553
he did not know.

43:48.553 --> 43:51.204
I used to write his essays, he was so bad!

43:51.204 --> 43:56.813
But after realization he wrote such beautiful
poems.

43:56.813 --> 43:58.593
Unbelievable!

43:58.593 --> 44:03.813
Nobody can believe this Baba could do that,
because he didn’t know any language well.

44:03.813 --> 44:08.323
I used to write his essays, as I told you.

44:08.323 --> 44:17.763
So, amazingly, from where he started writing
Urdu poetry, Marathi poetry, Hindi poetry?

44:17.763 --> 44:23.173
And one of My brothers asked him, “How do
you get this Urdu poetry?”

44:23.173 --> 44:26.892
He said, “Shri Mataji has, She tells me.”

44:26.892 --> 44:30.813
Everything he used to say, “Mataji tells
me.”

44:30.813 --> 44:41.195
So the creativity within you is just flowers,
and you are amazed at yourself

44:41.220 --> 44:44.003
how this creativity has come in.

44:44.003 --> 44:55.553
Now imagine, for a person who is a mathematician
becoming suddenly a poet – I mean, it’s

44:55.553 --> 44:58.103
impossible situation.

44:58.103 --> 44:59.823
And you have these capacities.

44:59.823 --> 45:06.005
You have all these capacities that you can
become very creative,

45:06.030 --> 45:11.253
and you have to be creative in every way.

45:11.253 --> 45:17.768
I am very creative, I must say, I am all the
time working out something

45:18.037 --> 45:21.084
which comes out very well.

45:21.633 --> 45:29.243
And also I don’t have that interest as normally
people have, that it should be praised by

45:29.243 --> 45:37.463
everyone or it should be, sort of, very much
in the newspapers and everything.

45:37.463 --> 45:40.113
No, no interest.

45:40.113 --> 45:47.463
You create for creation, for the sake of creation
you create, and you just enjoy that creation.

45:47.463 --> 45:59.123
And you become very adaptable, or you become
so congenial with all the things people say,

45:59.123 --> 46:04.463
talk – all right, let them do it.

46:04.463 --> 46:12.185
They will be offensive, or they could be also
praising you … you don’t know that they

46:12.996 --> 46:14.826
are praising you.

46:15.763 --> 46:19.013
Even sometimes when you “Shri Mataji ki
Jai!”

46:19.013 --> 46:28.133
– I also say, and then I forget they are
talking about Me.

46:28.133 --> 46:35.693
Somehow you are above all that, and you are
there, and you just don’t understand why

46:35.693 --> 46:42.593
human beings behave like that, why their behavior
is so funny.

46:42.593 --> 46:49.573
Even when they come to Sahaja Yoga I see they
have a great desire to be leaders, or they

46:49.573 --> 46:59.130
have a great desire to be a great organizer
of Sahaja Yoga,

46:59.155 --> 47:01.897
to be very well-known in Sahaja Yoga.

47:01.945 --> 47:11.795
They want to have an international fame as
a great Sahaja yogi.

47:12.303 --> 47:17.773
But they do not think that “What creativity
I have shown?

47:17.773 --> 47:21.673
What have I created?”

47:21.673 --> 47:27.833
Just all these things are so common in human
beings that they always want others to praise

47:27.833 --> 47:39.613
them, to have a very big sort of a exposure
– of what?

47:39.613 --> 47:42.993
If you are a spirit, everybody knows.

47:42.993 --> 47:50.423
What is there to expose, what is there to
show off, what is there to come forward?

47:50.423 --> 47:58.688
Even if you are at the back there is light,
you know there is light.

47:58.688 --> 48:06.813
So you have to get out of your darkness, because
you are the light and you spread light; instead

48:06.813 --> 48:14.552
of if you are in the darkness, what light
can you spread?

48:14.552 --> 48:18.833
So your spirit cannot have problems.

48:18.833 --> 48:23.473
It has no fear.

48:23.473 --> 48:33.353
But above all it has wisdom, tremendous wisdom,
and that wisdom is the one sign of you being

48:33.353 --> 48:35.943
a very higher personality.

48:35.943 --> 48:44.853
As I told you, this is evolution, and when
you are transformed you are evolved.

48:44.853 --> 48:53.613
Of a very different nature you become, and
you are to stand out.

48:53.613 --> 49:01.733
If Sahaja yogis are like other people, then
what’s the use of taking to Sahaja Yoga?

49:01.733 --> 49:03.173
What was Christ?

49:03.173 --> 49:06.133
He was a son of a carpenter.

49:06.133 --> 49:11.823
He never got education.

49:11.823 --> 49:14.673
But what did He do?

49:14.673 --> 49:20.263
He was the Spirit.

49:20.263 --> 49:32.713
He reflected God within Him, and that’s
why He got Himself crucified also.

49:32.713 --> 49:40.313
Now in Sahaja Yoga you don’t have to get
crucified, there are all not such testing

49:40.313 --> 49:47.413
things for you, but your value system is to
be checked.

49:47.413 --> 49:54.333
You must find out how are you working out,
through introspection.

49:54.333 --> 50:05.583
You should ask yourself, “So well now, Mr.
Sahaja yogi, how are you?

50:05.583 --> 50:10.305
Are you indulging into all these things that
these people

50:10.330 --> 50:14.376
who are not self-realized are doing?”

50:14.734 --> 50:23.494
Just try to find out, because the growth of
Sahaja Yoga is shown in your behavior, in

50:23.613 --> 50:30.573
your styles, on your face.

50:30.573 --> 50:41.403
There is no wrinkles on a person like this,
he has no worry; you don’t worry, then how

50:41.403 --> 50:43.863
will you get wrinkles?

50:43.863 --> 50:48.573
Such a person doesn’t get upset with anything.

50:48.573 --> 50:55.063
I mean, on the contrary he laughs at things.

50:55.063 --> 51:06.734
Once in a church there was in Switzerland,
one lady came to hit Me with a Bible, and

51:06.734 --> 51:07.753
I started laughing.

51:07.753 --> 51:12.763
I said, “What a thing, and I have to be
hit by a Bible!” you see.

51:12.763 --> 51:19.503
And she got such a fright that I was laughing,
and I was saying, “Look at this stupidity

51:19.503 --> 51:21.983
of this lady, coming to hit Me with a Bible!”

51:21.983 --> 51:28.063
I mean, I can understand stone or anything
else, but Bible will never hit Me.

51:28.063 --> 51:44.303
All these things have happened in your presence,
and you know about it.

51:44.303 --> 51:49.333
There are negative forces.

51:49.333 --> 51:50.853
They try to harm you.

51:50.853 --> 51:56.193
They will harm you bodily, they will harm
you mentally, they might harm you emotionally.

51:56.193 --> 52:04.433
But when you are above this, then no one harms
you.

52:04.433 --> 52:10.113
At least you never feel the harm, you are
not bothered about the harm.

52:10.113 --> 52:13.463
But what have you created?

52:13.463 --> 52:20.433
Today I had some ladies and some men, and
all for divorce.

52:20.433 --> 52:27.103
After getting married in Sahaja Yoga, they
want to have divorces, can you imagine?

52:27.103 --> 52:30.013
I was shocked.

52:30.013 --> 52:34.003
And they had funny ideas that “my husband
is like my brother.”

52:34.003 --> 52:36.613
I said, “Really?”

52:36.613 --> 52:42.253
All kinds of stupid ideas coming into their
heads means there’s no light of the spirit

52:42.253 --> 52:43.513
in them.

52:43.513 --> 52:52.213
If you have light of the spirit, then your
understanding is very different.

52:52.213 --> 52:58.593
You don’t worry about yourself, you only
worry about others, and you try to find out

52:58.593 --> 53:02.273
solutions for them.

53:02.273 --> 53:05.383
You try to help them.

53:05.383 --> 53:12.533
It is very easy for you.

53:12.533 --> 53:15.543
What is so easy for the light to burn?

53:15.543 --> 53:20.013
Once it is enlightened, it is burning.

53:20.013 --> 53:22.273
It’s difficult for it to go out of light.

53:22.273 --> 53:29.263
But for human beings, I can’t understand,
even after realization, after growing for

53:29.263 --> 53:36.983
years together they are still so stupid that
they don’t realize the value of their Self-realization.

53:36.983 --> 53:49.833
It is something, the spirit, you cannot kill
it.

53:49.833 --> 53:51.373
It cannot blow off.

53:51.373 --> 53:57.533
This light will go off, but the light of the
spirit won’t go off.

53:57.533 --> 54:07.093
But what is the oil that keeps it there is
your compassion, is love, care of others.

54:07.093 --> 54:12.533
I know there are people who are very, say,
dominating, may be troublesome, what else

54:12.533 --> 54:14.443
– but care for them.

54:14.443 --> 54:20.343
Know that they are not like you, they are
not complete, they have problems; so you care

54:20.343 --> 54:21.503
for them.

54:21.503 --> 54:25.733
But instead of that, you start thinking that
“Why should I care for him?

54:25.733 --> 54:26.833
How does he care for me?” or something.

54:26.833 --> 54:29.693
Then you are finished.

54:29.693 --> 54:39.043
So this kind of a reflection, or I would say
the reaction, is not that of a spirit.

54:39.043 --> 54:43.963
A spiritual person’s reactions are very,
very different.

54:43.963 --> 54:52.652
In the life of Shri Krishna you can see that
He had a friend who was very poor, and he

54:52.652 --> 54:56.243
wanted to meet Shri Krishna.

54:56.243 --> 55:03.263
And the wife of the friend gave him some rice
crispies, as you call them, “And that’s,

55:03.263 --> 55:05.353
take for your friend.

55:05.353 --> 55:07.063
You must take something for your friend.”

55:07.063 --> 55:10.793
He was a little shy, you know.

55:10.793 --> 55:18.623
And when he went to Shri Krishna, Shri Krishna
was in His palace, and the people at the door

55:18.623 --> 55:20.493
said, “No, you can’t meet Him.”

55:20.493 --> 55:22.173
He said, “All right.

55:22.173 --> 55:26.853
You just go and tell Him that Sudama has come.”

55:26.853 --> 55:34.083
He was sitting on the throne discussing something,
and He said, “Sudama has come!”

55:34.083 --> 55:48.132
He rushed out and went to the door and hugged
him, hugged him again and again; and He said,

55:48.132 --> 55:52.163
“Why are you standing here?”

55:52.163 --> 56:02.893
He took him and put him on the throne that
He was supposed to, and He told His wives,

56:02.893 --> 56:06.382
“Please come and wash his feet.”

56:06.382 --> 56:09.483
And then they brought for him clothes and
all that.

56:09.483 --> 56:19.553
He had a bath; He made him sleep on His bed
– see the love of Shri Krishna.

56:19.553 --> 56:24.303
He had very dirty feet, all were cracked.

56:24.303 --> 56:32.343
He tried to put on that some sort of a medicine
by which it would be all right.

56:32.343 --> 56:38.243
He tried to do whatever was possible to him
to cure those cracks.

56:38.243 --> 56:46.953
And He asked him to sleep on His bed, and
asked the ladies to fan him so that he doesn’t

56:46.953 --> 56:49.293
feel hot.

56:49.293 --> 56:57.243
See the compassion of Shri Krishna, it shows
so beautifully.

56:57.243 --> 57:00.803
Are we that compassionate?

57:00.803 --> 57:10.033
There was no need for Him to do that; it was
no drama, nothing – but His heart!

57:10.033 --> 57:14.523
He took a spontaneous decision.

57:14.523 --> 57:18.983
When He heard Sudama is there, He just rushed
there.

57:18.983 --> 57:28.723
He just felt so happy that “My old friend
has come.”

57:28.723 --> 57:44.803
Then, when He went to Hastinapur, there the
Duryodhan, the Kauravas’ eldest son, he

57:44.803 --> 57:48.073
asked Him that “Why don’t You come and
stay in my palace?”

57:48.073 --> 57:57.642
He said, “All right, I can come, but you
see, I will go and have food with Vidur.”

57:57.642 --> 58:02.313
Vidur was a son of a maid.

58:02.313 --> 58:09.243
He went and had His food with Vidur.

58:09.243 --> 58:18.313
Now Vidur being a poor man, I don’t know
what food he must have given Him, while Duryodhan

58:18.313 --> 58:22.053
would have given Him such sumptuous food.

58:22.053 --> 58:25.963
So for such people, taste and the level of
food and all doesn’t matter; it’s the

58:25.963 --> 58:37.033
love, the respect of Vidur, who was a realized
soul – respecting other Sahaja yogis.

58:37.033 --> 58:49.173
If a Sahaja yogi respects somebody who is
a governor – I can’t understand; the spirit

58:49.173 --> 58:54.993
is above everything else – and does not
respect a Sahaja yogi, there’s something

58:54.993 --> 58:57.303
wrong with him.

58:57.303 --> 59:03.573
He should understand that this spiritual person
is higher than all these people who have these,

59:03.573 --> 59:12.003
all kinds of these big names behind them.

59:12.003 --> 59:24.693
And that love is shown in everybody’s life:
all the saints, all the incarnations, everyone

59:24.693 --> 59:34.892
had that love which was above everything else,
without expecting anything, not doing it just

59:34.892 --> 59:39.083
to expect something from them.

59:39.083 --> 59:49.813
It is a kind of a personality which really
reflects God’s love.

59:49.813 --> 59:52.213
That reflection should come from you.

59:52.213 --> 01:00:00.363
You are Sahaja yogis: that doesn’t mean
that you are something higher than others,

01:00:00.363 --> 01:00:03.392
but you are different.

01:00:03.392 --> 01:00:06.423
You are above them.

01:00:06.423 --> 01:00:09.523
You have no superiority, that’s why you
are different.

01:00:09.523 --> 01:00:14.393
You are so humble, that’s why you are different.

01:00:14.393 --> 01:00:20.193
You are so joyous, you are so peaceful, that’s
why you are humble.

01:00:20.193 --> 01:00:30.053
There are so many things I can tell you from
the life of Shri Krishna, showing He was,

01:00:30.053 --> 01:00:33.763
they call Him Yogeshwara.

01:00:33.763 --> 01:00:36.693
He was a Lord of Yoga.

01:00:36.693 --> 01:00:42.613
It is because He was Virat.

01:00:42.613 --> 01:00:55.743
But He showed it, His form, only to Arjuna,
to nobody else, because nobody was like Arjuna.

01:00:55.743 --> 01:01:01.413
Arjuna also got a fright when he saw that.

01:01:01.413 --> 01:01:11.853
So He lived like Shri Krishna, like a cowboy
He was living in Gokul, and He never showed

01:01:11.853 --> 01:01:13.533
off His powers.

01:01:13.533 --> 01:01:22.433
His powers were within Himself, which were
expressing spontaneously.

01:01:22.433 --> 01:01:33.183
This power has wisdom and discretion, complete
discretion.

01:01:33.183 --> 01:01:42.224
If it does not have then this is not divine
power, this is some satanic power: because

01:01:42.224 --> 01:01:51.183
somebody is nice to you if you are nice to
that person, nothing doing.

01:01:51.183 --> 01:01:59.833
Mostly we had in India people who were called
as avadhutas.

01:01:59.833 --> 01:02:07.933
They were the realized souls who had gone
away from the society, from the multitudes,

01:02:07.933 --> 01:02:18.293
and gone and lived in some small little place
or some cave or somewhere, hidden from others;

01:02:18.293 --> 01:02:27.203
because they thought nobody is going to understand
them, so what’s the use of talking to them.

01:02:27.203 --> 01:02:33.753
They were singled out, one person here and
one person there.

01:02:33.753 --> 01:02:34.853
What could they do?

01:02:34.853 --> 01:02:40.783
They were not like you, so many of Sahaja
yogis together.

01:02:40.783 --> 01:02:45.193
You have so many friends and you have so many
others with you.

01:02:45.193 --> 01:02:51.333
They were lonely people, and they hid themselves
from the society.

01:02:51.333 --> 01:02:57.693
They would not meet people, because if they
tried anything they would be crucified.

01:02:57.693 --> 01:03:03.803
But not you people, because you have a society.

01:03:03.803 --> 01:03:16.632
You have a beautiful enlightened society of
very good friends, of very good spiritual

01:03:16.632 --> 01:03:17.793
people.

01:03:17.793 --> 01:03:27.233
With all this if you cannot create, then what
should I say?

01:03:27.233 --> 01:03:40.063
You have to create something: may be art,
may be music, may be poetry, may be literature,

01:03:40.063 --> 01:03:45.493
may be writing – whatever it is, you have
to create.

01:03:45.493 --> 01:03:49.642
And above all, you have to create Sahaja yogis.

01:03:49.642 --> 01:03:53.973
That’s the main creation you have to achieve.

01:03:53.973 --> 01:04:02.133
That’s the main thing you have to have,
is creating Sahaja yogis all over.

01:04:02.133 --> 01:04:09.063
And there I can go to places, can have programs,
do everything.

01:04:09.063 --> 01:04:17.513
But you have to show with your own example
that this is something great, how they have

01:04:17.513 --> 01:04:23.973
achieved this state; we should achieve also
that state.

01:04:23.973 --> 01:04:36.132
So you will be the ones who will really inspire
them, who will really make them follow you

01:04:36.132 --> 01:04:40.783
and take to a life of a Sahaja yogi.

01:04:40.783 --> 01:04:49.813
Actually you are Mahayogis, if you become
complete – and you have to become.

01:04:49.813 --> 01:04:56.433
Nothing is more important than becoming a
Mahayogi, by which your spirit gives joy,

01:04:59.333 --> 01:05:04.323
peace and blessings to everyone.

01:05:04.363 --> 01:05:10.663
May God bless you.
