00:45:06.759 --> 00:45:11.559
I am sorry, I had to speak in Marathi
language

00:45:11.584 --> 00:45:18.059
because I had to tell them something
which I don't want you to know.

00:45:28.571 --> 00:45:32.742
Today is a great day, I should say
in a way,

00:45:33.226 --> 00:45:40.135
because I am going to tell you
one thing great.

00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:47.873
That is Shri Gyaneshwara - in Marathi
they call it 'Dnyaneshwara' -

00:45:49.242 --> 00:45:56.372
He was the incarnation of Kartikeya.

00:45:59.310 --> 00:46:11.119
And Saraswati, who was a virgin,
she looked after Him like Her own son.

00:46:11.144 --> 00:46:18.961
He was the brother of Shri Ganapati
but She looked after Him.

00:46:18.986 --> 00:46:23.189
And then also there’s description how
He was born and all those (things),

00:46:23.214 --> 00:46:26.357
is very interesting.

00:46:26.382 --> 00:46:36.641
But here in this place, in this Maharashtra,
He took His incarnation.

00:46:36.666 --> 00:46:42.421
And also there were many great, great,
very great saints

00:46:42.446 --> 00:46:51.794
in so many numbers took place,
took their birth in this Maharashtra.

00:46:53.132 --> 00:47:00.342
But such horrible people, they tortured
their lives.

00:47:00.367 --> 00:47:03.353
Worse than Christian Inquisition I tell you;

00:47:03.378 --> 00:47:07.616
worse than any inquisition anywhere.

00:47:07.641 --> 00:47:11.143
Individually they attacked.

00:47:11.168 --> 00:47:16.669
And that same people are born again

00:47:18.211 --> 00:47:23.829
in this great country of Maharashtra.

00:47:23.854 --> 00:47:27.334
They are very talented people; they write
very well.

00:47:27.359 --> 00:47:31.704
Their language is so rich.

00:47:31.729 --> 00:47:38.693
You can see that, what description

00:47:40.255 --> 00:47:51.222
of a realized soul, given by Gyaneshwara,
is so beautiful.

00:47:52.521 --> 00:48:00.045
He says that, "The moon doesn’t run
after moonlight,

00:48:00.070 --> 00:48:05.339
the sun doesn’t run after sunlight.

00:48:05.364 --> 00:48:14.022
In that way a realized soul doesn’t bother
about his own glory.

00:48:16.845 --> 00:48:23.642
The sun shines till it shines, then it
takes back all his rays.

00:48:23.667 --> 00:48:30.701
Whatever work the rays have to do
they do it. And the sun is just watching,

00:48:30.969 --> 00:48:34.741
watching all the work, then he takes
them back.

00:48:34.766 --> 00:48:42.424
And he gets completely contained within
himself”.

00:48:42.449 --> 00:48:49.075
Samavun ghene, completely contained
within himself.

00:48:49.100 --> 00:48:55.067
The description He has given of realized
souls

00:48:55.092 --> 00:49:01.604
is so beautiful, if you could just
experience it.

00:49:01.629 --> 00:49:06.117
Namadeva, who was born much later,
said that

00:49:06.142 --> 00:49:15.573
even one line of Gyanesha [Gyaneshwara]
if you could experience,

00:49:15.598 --> 00:49:18.167
you had that.

00:49:18.192 --> 00:49:22.316
I wish you all could read Amrutanubhava
in English,

00:49:22.341 --> 00:49:28.342
understanding how He describes
a realized soul,

00:49:28.367 --> 00:49:32.496
and you'll find that within yourself
it has happened.

00:49:32.541 --> 00:49:36.113
You are different from others very much.

00:49:36.138 --> 00:49:46.255
You'll be amazed how you have got
such beautiful description of your Self.

00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:53.331
I was talking about Maharashtrians;
they are extremely talented people.

00:49:53.356 --> 00:49:59.568
See their music. In music no-one can
beat them.

00:49:59.593 --> 00:50:04.752
See their drama. In drama no-one can
beat them.

00:50:05.629 --> 00:50:10.697
You can see from films. In Maharashtra
only

00:50:10.722 --> 00:50:14.492
great films were created.

00:50:14.517 --> 00:50:20.907
The another one is Bengal, which is,

00:50:20.932 --> 00:50:27.278
I would say, different but of the same
level.

00:50:27.303 --> 00:50:31.776
It's such a talented people here,

00:50:31.801 --> 00:50:37.505
it shows that God has a special blessing
for these two,

00:50:37.530 --> 00:50:43.562
and, should be, Maharashtrians should rise
very high.

00:50:43.587 --> 00:50:48.880
But all the time complaining about others,
talking ill of others,

00:50:48.905 --> 00:50:52.520
and something very low they do.
I'm surprised that,

00:50:52.555 --> 00:50:58.920
I hope you don't pick up anything from them.

00:50:58.945 --> 00:51:07.523
And also the fussiness that is of the North
Indians;

00:51:07.548 --> 00:51:11.387
that's also not a very good thing.

00:51:11.412 --> 00:51:17.451
It's surprising how you people have adjusted
yourself to this country,

00:51:17.476 --> 00:51:22.317
which has all kinds of parasites.

00:51:22.342 --> 00:51:29.794
Because you live with vibrations, you feel
the vibrations.

00:51:29.819 --> 00:51:34.442
It's something so great to see you all here,

00:51:34.467 --> 00:51:41.490
and I'm telling them that they should try
to understand you people.

00:51:41.515 --> 00:51:48.051
Really I’m very proud of you all who have
come all the way here.

00:51:48.076 --> 00:51:57.957
In this puja I am thinking of so many great
saints who were born,

00:51:57.982 --> 00:52:04.706
who were great gurus, mahagurus. Of course
Gyanesha,

00:52:04.731 --> 00:52:15.317
I must say, is the king of all those high,
highly evolved souls, no doubt.

00:52:15.342 --> 00:52:23.286
So we are now having a puja on the twenty
-fourth of December

00:52:23.320 --> 00:52:28.861
because it's a Datta Jayanti, Dattatreya's
birth.

00:52:28.886 --> 00:52:32.651
And so we'll be having on the twenty-fourth
night.

00:52:32.676 --> 00:52:38.757
In any case it's a Christmas Eve. We could
all start with that.

00:52:38.782 --> 00:52:45.132
And also Dattatreya, who took His form
in Maharashtra.

00:52:45.157 --> 00:52:49.739
Maharashtrians understand Dattatreya.

00:52:49.764 --> 00:52:55.503
They understand the Nath Panthis.
These Nathas went all over.

00:52:55.528 --> 00:53:04.508
They went to Kiev. You'll be amazed,
they went even up to Bolivia,

00:53:04.533 --> 00:53:12.926
those who are from Maharashtra, from Rahuri.
Can you imagine?

00:53:12.951 --> 00:53:17.366
Such great people they were,

00:53:17.391 --> 00:53:22.879
and that is what I expect to happen
in this Maharashtra.

00:53:22.904 --> 00:53:30.740
And I'm sure one day I'll be very much
happy with all of them; not few.

00:53:30.765 --> 00:53:34.809
There are some very great Maharashtrians,
no doubt,

00:53:34.835 --> 00:53:41.784
but all of them have to join together
because I talk of synthesis,

00:53:41.809 --> 00:53:45.053
not of divisive method.

00:53:45.078 --> 00:53:51.352
I hope they understand the inner feeling
that I have,

00:53:51.377 --> 00:54:00.576
otherwise all the good diamonds will be
selected

00:54:00.601 --> 00:54:05.844
and the ones which are defective will be
thrown away.

00:54:07.337 --> 00:54:14.326
What's the use? But all of them are capable
of achieving any height.

00:54:14.351 --> 00:54:17.885
They may belong to any caste, community,
doesn't matter;

00:54:17.910 --> 00:54:21.913
but they are born in Maharashtra,

00:54:21.938 --> 00:54:26.273
which is such a great country.

00:54:26.298 --> 00:54:29.468
So today they wanted to do Mahalakshmi,

00:54:29.493 --> 00:54:33.283
this thing, we already have Mahalakshmi
temple.

00:54:33.308 --> 00:54:38.352
And they have a great blessing of Mahalakshmi
also, in a way,

00:54:38.377 --> 00:54:43.880
but they lack: one is the wisdom,

00:54:43.905 --> 00:54:49.740
and the second the spirit of Kartikeya.

00:54:50.587 --> 00:54:58.421
The spirit of Kartikeya - that

00:55:02.587 --> 00:55:09.254
pure, absolute dynamism

00:55:10.053 --> 00:55:17.608
which doesn't indulge into nonsensical things
and useless things;

00:55:17.633 --> 00:55:23.662
which shows results.
May God bless you all!
