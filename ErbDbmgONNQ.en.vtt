00:00:04.592 --> 00:00:12.279
Now we are facing little children.

00:00:12.526 --> 00:00:20.148
They are the ones who are incarnations.

00:00:21.937 --> 00:00:27.751
They are the ones who are going
to lead humanity

00:00:27.952 --> 00:00:36.911
into some great advancement –

00:00:37.112 --> 00:00:42.870
the humanity has to be looked after.

00:00:43.076 --> 00:00:49.244
They are tomorrow’s humanity.
And we are today’s.

00:00:49.445 --> 00:00:55.933
And what are we giving to them
for them to follow?

00:00:56.134 --> 00:01:01.131
What is their aim in life?

00:01:02.284 --> 00:01:05.910
Very, very difficult to say.

00:01:06.111 --> 00:01:14.733
But with the Sahaja Yoga they will
all go in the proper way,

00:01:14.934 --> 00:01:17.996
they’ll behave in a proper way

00:01:18.196 --> 00:01:26.847
and the whole thing will be a different
mass of Sahaja Yogis coming up.

00:01:27.048 --> 00:01:33.294
But it is the duty of bigger Sahaja Yogis
to look after them;

00:01:33.495 --> 00:01:38.804
to have better moral standards,
to have better lives

00:01:39.005 --> 00:01:48.760
so that they follow your life and become
genuinely good Sahaja Yogis.

00:01:48.961 --> 00:01:56.963
It’s a very big responsibility, perhaps
we don’t recognise it, we don’t understand,

00:01:57.164 --> 00:02:08.552
but all these are little creatures
which are after the image

00:02:08.753 --> 00:02:16.300
of great souls and they should be
brought up in that way,

00:02:16.501 --> 00:02:24.315
respected in that manner and loved
with great care.

00:02:24.516 --> 00:02:32.296
This is to be understood. The problem
with our elderly people is this,

00:02:32.497 --> 00:02:38.194
that we do not consider them
to be considered,

00:02:38.424 --> 00:02:45.554
to be bothered about, to be understood
about. We think we are too intelligent,

00:02:45.755 --> 00:02:50.791
too good and we need not waste
our energy with them.

00:02:50.992 --> 00:02:54.691
This is the trouble of the elderly
people.

00:02:54.892 --> 00:03:02.351
But today when we are sitting here
to worship Shri Ganesha,

00:03:02.552 --> 00:03:06.833
we should know they are all incarnations
of Shri Ganesha

00:03:07.034 --> 00:03:15.724
and they should be given proper attention,
proper understanding about themselves.

00:03:15.925 --> 00:03:25.663
I find certain amount of children who are
very well-behaved, which are very sensible,

00:03:25.864 --> 00:03:31.751
and there are some who have no idea
as to what they are doing.

00:03:31.952 --> 00:03:38.157
So it is the duty of the elders to put
ideas into their head,

00:03:38.358 --> 00:03:44.189
to proper understanding about themselves
and the self-respect.

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:50.882
Same thing I would say for the elder
Sahaja Yogis

00:03:51.082 --> 00:03:55.801
who have to look after their younger
brothers and sisters.

00:03:56.001 --> 00:04:01.839
In this family of ours which we call
as Sahaja Yogis,

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:08.334
there are all kinds of people, all types,
all behaviours.

00:04:08.534 --> 00:04:15.802
Of course, they should not be regimented,
there should not be uniformity,

00:04:16.003 --> 00:04:19.520
but in that variety there should be
with beauty,

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:27.249
there should be beautiful trend of being
one with each other.

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:32.024
For that, what should we do,
is the problem.

00:04:32.225 --> 00:04:36.705
What should the elders do to achieve that?

00:04:36.905 --> 00:04:44.990
What is our solid contribution
to their lives?

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:56.981
The first will be to tell them who is
Shri Ganesha,

00:04:57.568 --> 00:05:05.360
and that what are the qualities of Ganesha,
what does He represent.

00:05:05.561 --> 00:05:11.326
What does He represent, what qualities
He has.

00:05:11.526 --> 00:05:17.564
And once they start understanding, that
though being a little boy,

00:05:17.765 --> 00:05:24.444
He’s so generous, He’s so kind,
He’s so forgiving,

00:05:24.645 --> 00:05:29.822
they’ll be amazed because they are
also small

00:05:30.023 --> 00:05:35.481
and they’ll also take to that kind of life.

00:05:35.682 --> 00:05:41.825
I find some children very sensible,
very good here.

00:05:42.025 --> 00:05:48.073
Some are naughty and some don’t understand
what we are doing here.

00:05:48.274 --> 00:05:52.776
Whatever it is, they are after all
children.

00:05:52.977 --> 00:05:59.287
And what you have to do is to look
after them, respect them,

00:05:59.487 --> 00:06:07.779
and give them the full idea about
Shri Ganesha.

00:06:08.018 --> 00:06:15.703
I think everybody must have a statue
of Shri Ganesha in your house,

00:06:15.903 --> 00:06:21.457
so the children will see it and ask,
“Who is He? What is He doing here?”

00:06:21.658 --> 00:06:25.677
And you’ll be amazed how they will
understand Him,

00:06:25.878 --> 00:06:31.520
how they will understand His qualities
and how they will work it out.

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:39.002
It is important for all of you to have
at least one Shri Ganesha in your house,

00:06:39.203 --> 00:06:45.453
so that you can tell your children that,
‘You all have to become like Him’.

00:06:45.653 --> 00:06:50.163
Now what are the qualities of Shri Ganesha?

00:06:50.364 --> 00:06:54.513
They won’t understand chastity,
they are too small,

00:06:54.714 --> 00:06:58.179
they won’t understand all those qualities.

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:07.968
But one quality they will understand
is to be honest. Is to be honest.

00:07:27.305 --> 00:07:36.173
Gradually you’ll find all difficult ones
will go down, it will work out that way.

00:07:36.374 --> 00:07:42.013
Because you see, they don’t understand
My lecture,

00:07:42.214 --> 00:07:45.246
they don’t understand what I am saying.

00:07:45.447 --> 00:07:53.183
But one thing is there, if there are some
oppositions within, they will show –

00:07:53.384 --> 00:07:59.468
show very well – because they are
so innocent and so simple,

00:07:59.669 --> 00:08:07.898
their innocence will help them to expose
them to reality.

00:08:08.867 --> 00:08:14.727
I hope you all look after your children,
guide them properly

00:08:14.928 --> 00:08:27.820
and take them to a level of understanding
that they understand what is their position,

00:08:28.021 --> 00:08:33.478
what qualities they should have,
why will they be respected.

00:08:33.679 --> 00:08:40.245
You’ll be amazed, that their behaviour
will change

00:08:40.446 --> 00:08:44.857
the behaviour of all the other children.

00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:53.062
What I have to say that nobody should think
that you are very grown-up

00:08:53.263 --> 00:08:58.473
because you can keep quiet, sit quietly
and all that, no.

00:08:58.674 --> 00:09:05.630
You are grown-up only if you can imbibe
the qualities of Shri Ganesha.

00:09:05.831 --> 00:09:12.581
I have seen people who are very grown-up
still do not have simple qualities

00:09:12.782 --> 00:09:17.952
of chastity, of honesty.

00:09:18.153 --> 00:09:25.285
They don’t have, and they can’t have,
because they don’t think it is important.

00:09:25.486 --> 00:09:34.017
So, I leave it to you to find out
Shri Ganesha within yourself.

00:09:37.286 --> 00:09:42.444
I enjoy their company because
they are so innocent

00:09:42.645 --> 00:09:51.185
and so simple-hearted and I like them
very, very much.

00:09:59.632 --> 00:10:07.652
So, you should not get afraid or frightened
of their mischief.

00:10:07.817 --> 00:10:13.493
On the contrary, you should know
they deserve much more love,

00:10:13.693 --> 00:10:20.589
much more understanding and much more
scope to grow.

00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:27.143
I hope by the time they will be of your age,
they’ll be great Sahaja Yogis.

00:10:27.343 --> 00:10:30.562
They’ll understand what we are doing here.

00:10:30.768 --> 00:10:38.149
I had to face mountains of nonsense
with the older people,

00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:45.223
but these won’t have that. They’ll be
very simple, very sweet

00:10:45.424 --> 00:10:49.160
and they’ll understand love.

00:10:50.398 --> 00:10:54.774
So I would say we can allow these children
to go out and play

00:10:54.974 --> 00:11:01.036
and somebody can look after them,
so that you’ll be at peace.

00:11:06.185 --> 00:11:09.283
Who can take them out?

00:11:33.485 --> 00:11:40.100
You can give Me flowers. If you have got
flowers, I’ll take them.

00:11:48.898 --> 00:11:51.377
Thank you.

00:11:52.723 --> 00:11:55.908
Thank you very much.

00:11:57.168 --> 00:12:02.348
What is it? Boy: Chocolate.
Pujari: Chocolate.

00:12:02.549 --> 00:12:05.175
Boy: Yes, chocolate.
Pujari: Chocolate. Chocolate, Shri Mataji.

00:12:05.376 --> 00:12:09.110
Thank you. Thank you very much.

00:12:14.839 --> 00:12:17.451
Thank you.

00:12:59.838 --> 00:13:02.512
Thank you.

00:13:03.721 --> 00:13:06.308
Thank you.

00:13:19.709 --> 00:13:22.550
Avinash: Can we have some volunteers?
Please, take the children out.

00:13:22.751 --> 00:13:24.801
Shri Mataji would like the children
to play outside.

00:13:25.002 --> 00:13:28.705
Can we have some mothers, some aunties
if they can please take them out?

00:13:28.971 --> 00:13:31.852
So we can proceed, please.

00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:35.936
Any volunteers, anyone?

00:13:36.563 --> 00:13:38.888
If Yuva Shakti...
