00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:06.970
…that has to be first realised – what
is your category.

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:22.590
And if you are that category, of the category
which is seeking beyond what you have and

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:36.800
that you are not satisfied with what you have
already, then you are the category of seekers

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:47.240
who have been seeking something that is very
subtle, that is not gross, not intelligible

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.410
through your sensory organs.

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:56.560
How it happens within us – it is very interesting
to see.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:06.441
Within us, as I have told you, there are these
subtle centres which have developed through

00:01:06.441 --> 00:01:10.240
the process of our evolution.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:17.810
Through the process of our evolution we have
become human beings.

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:26.840
While we were becoming human beings, all these
centres have been also evolving within us.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:37.049
These centres are placed in the spinal cord,
in the centre of the spinal cord, and they

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.549
manifest outside grossly on [the] physical
level, as plexuses.

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:54.210
As they are evolving inside, also the outside,
the gross plexuses are also evolving.

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:00.670
For example, animals do not insure their lives,
do they?

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.930
They have fear.

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:12.920
They know how to react to a fear but they
do not know how to insure.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:19.160
After some time the animals forget their children.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.440
Animals can pass through any filth, any dirt,
any untidiness.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.370
They don’t understand tidiness, neatness.

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.800
Animals do not organise.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:40.400
Animals don’t plan.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:47.790
They do sometimes when they have to catch
hold of a prey, but that too, not too far.

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:53.330
Like we have five-year plans, ten-year plans,
twenty-year plans as the human being have.

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.069
They do not put any energy into that.

00:02:55.069 --> 00:03:12.760
The reason for all this is that man has evolved
much more than all the animals put together.

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:18.740
He is an evolved soul.

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:31.760
Now these evolved souls have also got a category
of greater evolved people who are not satisfied

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:37.290
with the general norms of life.

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:47.610
For example, there are people who are interested
say, in having power.

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:48.989
And they want to have power.

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:52.000
Till they die they want to have power.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.879
Till they die they won’t give a resignation.

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:59.360
I mean, sometimes they put one foot in the
grave and still the resignation in the another

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:04.550
hand, in case they do not die and they have
to pull out the leg, so it’s better to keep

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:05.550
it handy!

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:15.019
There are people who stick on to other games
of life, like money.

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:18.449
They are money-oriented people.

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:20.739
They find their securities in money.

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:21.870
They run after money.

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.310
They plan out everything according to money.

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:27.880
All their lives they are doing that.

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:36.240
There are [a] third type of people who indulge
into so-called love affairs and things like

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:43.040
that; into emotional movements of their mind.

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:57.020
But there are some others who think that these
things are not so interesting for them.

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:02.860
So the fourth category takes to religion – to
know about beyond.

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:14.380
They read about the prophets, the great scriptures,
all the great religions of the world.

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:28.150
But as the pioneer of the religion dies, the
followers, somehow or other, built in fanaticism

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:39.710
around them and fanaticism is the death of
religion, is absolutely the death of religion.

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:49.770
I have seen people who get cancer are sometimes
fanatics.

00:05:49.770 --> 00:06:02.680
If you could cure their fanaticism, you can
cure their cancer because all such false identification

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:06.370
requires extra energy in a man.

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:09.919
He has to stick on to some sort of obstinacy!

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:15.990
Now supposing I am holding on to it (the microphone)
and I do not want to leave my hand from here

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:17.710
– for nothing at all!

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:18.990
I say, “No, I am not going to leave."

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:19.990
“No!

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:20.990
This is the thing I believe into.

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:25.580
I am going to stick on to it!”

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:29.300
Then I require a lot of energy to hold on
to it.

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:33.400
But if I could be free and see, it is better.

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:39.449
Like I remember a gentleman fell down from
the sixteenth story and he was asking for

00:06:39.449 --> 00:06:42.140
help and help.

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:44.889
And he saw people passing from the back.

00:06:44.889 --> 00:06:50.060
He was holding onto one of the rails, and
he could not understand how the people are

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:51.060
passing around.

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:52.569
He said, “Help for what?”

00:06:52.569 --> 00:06:54.000
He said, “I’m falling."

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.080
They said, “Where?

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:57.289
Here is the road!”

00:06:57.289 --> 00:07:01.180
He had, just near the road, had caught hold
of the rod!

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:03.130
And he was asking for help, and he was just
shouting.

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:04.539
When they said, “This is the road.

00:07:04.539 --> 00:07:06.910
You better put your foot down."

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:08.030
he fainted!

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:16.360
Because he had put all his energy into a nonsensical
thing, believing into a myth.

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:27.020
And myth always takes away your energy, while
the Truth enriches your energy.

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:33.190
Because you don’t have to hold on to the
Truth, the Truth carries you along.

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:42.470
Any kind of fanaticism is not your way, as
I told you yesterday.

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:46.790
And if anybody is a fanatic, then he is not
seeker.

00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:50.220
Because he’s found whatever it is.

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:54.229
He has to deal with his fanaticism and his
faiths.

00:07:54.229 --> 00:08:02.460
So the another category of people are there
which are anti everything: everything that

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:03.710
is established.

00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:04.900
Anything.

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:10.870
Christ – they are against Christ.

00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:12.060
Anything.

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:15.650
They are reactionaries.

00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:18.949
They are against Nanak Saheb, they are against
Mohammed Saheb.

00:08:18.949 --> 00:08:24.610
They are against everything that has been
established because whatever is established

00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:25.650
is not true.

00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:31.160
Those who have established have taken a mythical
attitude.

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:47.339
When they take up a mythical attitude and
they try to stick onto it, those who think

00:08:47.339 --> 00:08:51.980
about it are shocked and they think, “These
are drunk people.

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:53.040
These are possessed people!”

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:54.959
So they say, “Alright, that we are not!”

00:08:54.959 --> 00:08:56.679
So we become atheist.

00:08:56.679 --> 00:08:58.839
We don’t believe in God.

00:08:58.839 --> 00:09:01.480
We don’t believe in any spiritual power.

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:04.740
We do not believe in any divine power.

00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:11.569
We do not believe in anything that is said
before.

00:09:11.569 --> 00:09:13.752
According to them, all prophets were wrong.

00:09:13.752 --> 00:09:15.550
All religions are wrong.

00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:20.839
There is no God – [they think they are]
the wisest people every born!

00:09:20.839 --> 00:09:23.110
So there is another category of extra-wise.

00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:25.089
You can call them intellectuals.

00:09:25.089 --> 00:09:30.860
These days I don’t know what you call them.

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:35.550
This is another category.

00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:45.160
Now there is another very subtle category,
which tries to exploit all these things that

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:47.749
are existing.

00:09:47.749 --> 00:09:54.449
Some of them do it because they do believe
that they have found out something new, like

00:09:54.449 --> 00:09:57.379
psychologist, like Freud.

00:09:57.379 --> 00:10:05.429
They are ignorant, absolutely half-baked people.

00:10:05.429 --> 00:10:07.819
They do not know the whole thing.

00:10:07.819 --> 00:10:11.799
They just know a part of it and to them that’s
the truth.

00:10:11.799 --> 00:10:17.579
Like you find a needle somewhere and say the
needle is the whole world.

00:10:17.579 --> 00:10:22.319
They know very little and they don’t know
what to do with the needle, and so they come

00:10:22.319 --> 00:10:26.040
out with the needle, saying, “Needle is
the world!”

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:32.750
And such people are very anxious to write
books and convey their messages to the world

00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:39.040
and communicate to the whole world what they
have found out, while whatever they have found

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:49.300
out is nothing but just a few drops of truth.

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:54.839
And they are trying their level best to spoil
[it].

00:10:54.839 --> 00:11:01.610
Now there is a category of another people
which are sinister.

00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:05.459
In that you know so many types which I do
not want to discuss here.

00:11:05.459 --> 00:11:09.009
From Hitler you can start, all kinds of brutal
people and all that.

00:11:09.009 --> 00:11:11.939
They go parallel with all these categories.

00:11:11.939 --> 00:11:19.610
But I would say the worst of all are those
who try to make money in the name of God,

00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:29.439
and worse than that, the worst of all, are
the people who try to play games with God.

00:11:29.439 --> 00:11:39.389
Those who take money are openly bad but those
who try to play with your Kundalini, with

00:11:39.389 --> 00:11:45.600
your Realisation, are really to be called
as demonic categories.

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:53.199
And all such people should know, as Blake
has said, that they will go to the hell from

00:11:53.199 --> 00:11:56.389
where they can never rise.

00:11:56.389 --> 00:12:02.869
Now whether you believe it or not, there is
God.

00:12:02.869 --> 00:12:12.559
Sahaja Yoga is a thing today which has reached
that stage where the category of people who

00:12:12.559 --> 00:12:18.670
are men of God, they do not proclaim on the
streets that, “I am a man of God."

00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:19.930
No.

00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:25.259
They do not stand up with banners in their
hands that, “I am the man of God."

00:12:25.259 --> 00:12:26.949
They are very normal people.

00:12:26.949 --> 00:12:28.129
They are householders.

00:12:28.129 --> 00:12:29.320
They have children.

00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:31.139
They have grandchildren.

00:12:31.139 --> 00:12:32.980
They are very simple people.

00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:35.319
They lead a very ordinary life.

00:12:35.319 --> 00:12:37.880
They are not very successful people.

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:43.819
But they are people, men of God.

00:12:43.819 --> 00:12:52.879
And these human beings of God are the ones
I am talking about, is the category you people

00:12:52.879 --> 00:12:54.779
are.

00:12:54.779 --> 00:13:00.430
If you are not that category, Sahaja Yoga
is not going to work on you to begin with.

00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:08.209
Later on, when we have a particular number
of people, the evolution will take such a

00:13:08.209 --> 00:13:16.519
dynamic form, that thousands of people will
receive their Self-realisation.

00:13:16.519 --> 00:13:23.920
Now the Self-realisation is the thing in which
an ordinary man who looks an ordinary common

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:33.509
person but who is actually a seeker, a true
seeker, not a false seeker but a true seeker,

00:13:33.509 --> 00:13:39.170
receives the grace of the Divine and becomes
a prophet.

00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:43.910
He becomes a prophet.

00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:53.389
This is what Sahaja Yoga is, that it makes
you a prophet and a prophet of a very unique

00:13:53.389 --> 00:14:01.779
style, because the job of today’s modern
prophets is very different from the prophets

00:14:01.779 --> 00:14:06.239
which came before, as I told you yesterday.

00:14:06.239 --> 00:14:14.499
The prophets who came before, as we celebrated
yesterday, Guru Nanaka’s birthday and Mohammed

00:14:14.499 --> 00:14:21.019
Saheb and all others, like Moses, Abraham
and all these, was to maintain your sustenance

00:14:21.019 --> 00:14:26.899
through giving you Ten Commandments.

00:14:26.899 --> 00:14:32.779
And these Ten Commandments exist in that centre
there, where you see the green centre.

00:14:32.779 --> 00:14:34.420
You can see it very clearly in your stomach.

00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:36.870
The religion is in your stomach.

00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:39.329
It’s a thing built within you.

00:14:39.329 --> 00:14:42.720
It is not that I can give you a lecture about
religion.

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:43.989
But it is built within you.

00:14:43.989 --> 00:14:47.089
It is inside you.

00:14:47.089 --> 00:14:54.629
And this religion is to be maintained, was
to be maintained that time; very important

00:14:54.629 --> 00:15:01.639
was that people should know what helps them
to be a human being.

00:15:01.639 --> 00:15:07.290
And that was the job of all these prophets
and they did it very well.

00:15:07.290 --> 00:15:15.279
But their disciples and maybe their followers
made them into fanatic religions.

00:15:15.279 --> 00:15:16.839
You can’t help it.

00:15:16.839 --> 00:15:21.720
I mean, I have always said that they were
like living flowers on this Earth, who came

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:24.249
one after another on the Tree of Life.

00:15:24.249 --> 00:15:28.079
And people just plucked those flowers and
said, “This is mine.

00:15:28.079 --> 00:15:29.079
This is mine."

00:15:29.079 --> 00:15:34.119
The flowers became dead, ugly and useless.

00:15:34.119 --> 00:15:37.029
That is how fanaticism has prospered.

00:15:37.029 --> 00:15:45.129
And all the fanaticism in these modern times
is [now] challenged.

00:15:45.129 --> 00:15:49.949
Everywhere people can see it that it is not
logical to be fanatic.

00:15:49.949 --> 00:16:00.169
But as a result of ego activity in thinking
they go to another extreme by which they condemn

00:16:00.169 --> 00:16:07.089
even the real flowers, even the originators,
the ones who came on this Earth.

00:16:07.089 --> 00:16:09.879
This is going too far from the right point.

00:16:09.879 --> 00:16:14.139
From one extreme to another extreme they are
moving.

00:16:14.139 --> 00:16:24.559
Now the specialty of the modern prophets is
that you can make other people prophets.

00:16:24.559 --> 00:16:27.600
That means you can give them Realisation yourself.

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:34.259
This is the difference between the Sahaja
Yoga that worked out at the time of other

00:16:34.259 --> 00:16:35.259
people.

00:16:35.259 --> 00:16:38.470
That’s why there was hardly one or two Realised-souls.

00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:46.179
At the time of Janaka – say about eight
thousand years back when Shri Rama was ruling,

00:16:46.179 --> 00:16:53.069
his father-in-law, who was a great prophet
– he had one disciple whom he gave Realisation.

00:16:53.069 --> 00:16:59.049
And with very great tests and all that he
took under his own guidance.

00:16:59.049 --> 00:17:01.550
He gave him Realisation.

00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:10.339
But today the time has changed because the
Life’s Tree has increased, has reach to

00:17:10.339 --> 00:17:12.610
that state of maturity, where thousands of
you have to be transformed.

00:17:12.610 --> 00:17:14.490
It has to be done.

00:17:14.490 --> 00:17:18.089
It’s the God’s plan.

00:17:18.089 --> 00:17:23.939
And those who fit into it are the people who
are of the category who are seeking.

00:17:23.939 --> 00:17:35.600
Now, such category can be understood by many
ways and there are some tests to understand

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:38.580
what these people are.

00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:45.210
It may be that such people could be extremely
nervous people, could be, because they cannot

00:17:45.210 --> 00:17:49.630
bear the unrighteous, sinful, deceitful world.

00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:56.409
The whole atmosphere may be jarring them.

00:17:56.409 --> 00:18:00.080
That’s why they are very shaky.

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:03.690
Could be they might be very nervous because
of that.

00:18:03.690 --> 00:18:07.059
They could be a people who might be a recluses.

00:18:07.059 --> 00:18:12.390
They might be people who might be hot-tempered.

00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:15.220
They might be people who are escapists.

00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:17.559
They could be the people who could be druggist.

00:18:17.559 --> 00:18:20.159
Could be alcoholic.

00:18:20.159 --> 00:18:31.280
They could be anything, because they are running
away from the so-called horrible ‘reality’.

00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:36.519
Sahaja Yoga is a thing which establishes your
reality within yourself, by which you feel

00:18:36.519 --> 00:18:43.840
secure, because your reality is beauty, it
is joy.

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:48.710
And then you don’t want to run away from
that.

00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:58.070
This is what we have to understand, that we
are here to receive our reality, to know ourselves.

00:18:58.070 --> 00:19:02.919
By knowing ourselves, how many things can
happen to us, you have no idea.

00:19:02.919 --> 00:19:10.080
The whole property that you are, the whole
wealth that you are, the whole beauty that

00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:13.250
you are, becomes your own.

00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:15.850
You become the master of your own being.

00:19:15.850 --> 00:19:21.730
This is the first thing that should happen:
means your ill health must get alright.

00:19:21.730 --> 00:19:26.039
You know that there are people here who had
very serious diseases, who got completely

00:19:26.039 --> 00:19:27.039
cured.

00:19:27.039 --> 00:19:31.570
You know there are people who have mental
problems, who had epilepsies and things – they

00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:32.570
are cured.

00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:34.289
And how it happens?

00:19:34.289 --> 00:19:37.630
Just by knowing yourself, how powerful you
are.

00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:39.480
Just think of that!

00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:46.899
Think of your own powers that, just by knowing
yourself, how you have become so powerful.

00:19:46.899 --> 00:19:51.050
But this knowledge is not through your rationality,
that, “I am such.

00:19:51.050 --> 00:19:52.380
I am Napoleon.

00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:55.530
I am this."

00:19:55.530 --> 00:20:00.830
This kind of a knowledge is really stupid,
it’s egoistical.

00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:07.669
But this knowledge is a dynamism in your own
awareness.

00:20:07.669 --> 00:20:13.610
It’s a new perception within you by which
you become something.

00:20:13.610 --> 00:20:15.669
You become a different person.

00:20:15.669 --> 00:20:20.919
You become a higher, evolved soul.

00:20:20.919 --> 00:20:28.370
And then you realise that you have suddenly
become a being who is collectively conscious.

00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:32.980
Some progress very fast but some do not.

00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:34.840
Some progress tremendously fast.

00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:41.649
I know of a gentlemen who was supposed to
be a drunkard and used to waste all his money

00:20:41.649 --> 00:20:45.649
in races and he did all kinds of things.

00:20:45.649 --> 00:20:49.110
He used to smoke like a chimney.

00:20:49.110 --> 00:20:54.580
And when he got his Realisation, the whole
room was filled with fragrance.

00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:56.690
And everybody said, “This man?

00:20:56.690 --> 00:20:58.389
How can we believe, Mother?

00:20:58.389 --> 00:20:59.909
He is this and this and this."

00:20:59.909 --> 00:21:03.139
I said, “But this is what it is!

00:21:03.139 --> 00:21:06.820
This was all the clouds upon him.

00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:10.340
And all the clouds have gone away and you
see the sun coming in him.

00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:12.039
He’s a different man."

00:21:12.039 --> 00:21:13.870
I don’t believe in the clouds, I believe
in the sun.

00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:17.919
If I see the sun, the sun is there.

00:21:17.919 --> 00:21:19.200
I don’t see the clouds at all.

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:20.200
I see the sun.

00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:21.740
Perhaps I have more penetrating eyes than
you have.

00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:24.840
And I see the sun in the man.

00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:26.200
He has risen out of that.

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:28.240
And now he is shining like a sun.

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:31.340
So accept him and bow to him.

00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:33.669
He’s the one who was seeking, really, within.

00:21:33.669 --> 00:21:36.279
He thought that by playing races he’ll find
joy.

00:21:36.279 --> 00:21:42.110
He thought by eating food like that he will
have joy, or by smoking like that he will

00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:43.110
have joy.

00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:45.789
But he never was satisfied within himself.

00:21:45.789 --> 00:21:51.299
He never got involved into it to that extent
that he lost his own being and his seeking

00:21:51.299 --> 00:21:56.460
and that’s how he is the one who is a true
seeker.

00:21:56.460 --> 00:22:03.679
Sometimes it is some shocking to see in Sahaja
Yoga how people get transformed just like

00:22:03.679 --> 00:22:04.679
that.

00:22:04.679 --> 00:22:08.970
Just the change starts coming, as if some
magic has happened in the person’s life

00:22:08.970 --> 00:22:09.970
and he changes.

00:22:09.970 --> 00:22:13.139
But actually it is very simple to understand.

00:22:13.139 --> 00:22:22.289
When it rains and the whole place is so foggy,
you don’t feel like going out anywhere:

00:22:22.289 --> 00:22:25.740
it’s so grey, you feel so horrible.

00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:32.269
But when the sun comes out, everyone, children,
old people, young people, the housewives,

00:22:32.269 --> 00:22:36.779
all of them come out to greet the sun.

00:22:36.779 --> 00:22:45.230
When your sun comes out and you see your brilliance
yourself and then, “Oh, it’s me!

00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:47.330
Is it me?

00:22:47.330 --> 00:22:49.299
Oh, God!”

00:22:49.299 --> 00:22:51.539
And that starts transforming.

00:22:51.539 --> 00:22:54.860
And you are amazed to see yourself the way
you are transformed.

00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:56.640
That has to happen for you.

00:22:56.640 --> 00:23:02.019
But for this, already God has planned within
you all these things very beautifully.

00:23:02.019 --> 00:23:07.940
As beautifully as He has made your exterior,
He has made your interior equally beautifully,

00:23:07.940 --> 00:23:11.460
very delicately and with very great, very
great care.

00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:19.360
Within you lies the Kundalini, in the triangular
bone, the sacred bone called as sacrum, which

00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:21.389
gives you Realisation.

00:23:21.389 --> 00:23:30.730
This is one about which Christ has said, “I
will appear before you like tongues of flames."

00:23:30.730 --> 00:23:34.100
What is that?

00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:45.490
Every person has talked about him, but the
trouble is, how will you explain tongues of

00:23:45.490 --> 00:23:46.490
flames?

00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:48.899
Kabira has talked so clearly.

00:23:48.899 --> 00:23:50.999
He has said, “Ida, Pingala, Sushumna."

00:23:50.999 --> 00:23:58.419
Everything he has talked about, he talked
about Kundalini!

00:23:58.419 --> 00:24:02.279
Shankaracharya has talked about.

00:24:02.279 --> 00:24:04.159
I would say Blake, William Blake.

00:24:04.159 --> 00:24:05.159
You read him.

00:24:05.159 --> 00:24:06.159
You will be amazed!

00:24:06.159 --> 00:24:08.059
He’s talking of today in his book, “Milton”.

00:24:08.059 --> 00:24:11.400
He is talking of Jerusalem of today.

00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:20.030
This place, this England, is going to be the
Jerusalem, is the pilgrimage, where the people

00:24:20.030 --> 00:24:23.840
of God are going to be the prophets.

00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:25.540
He has talked of today!

00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:26.540
Can you imagine?

00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:30.370
He was not very old; he was not very ancient,
very modern.

00:24:30.370 --> 00:24:35.120
He has prophesised about these days and it
is happening.

00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:39.330
You don’t have to worry about these things.

00:24:39.330 --> 00:24:45.779
It is God’s plan that He has done it so
well, and individually all of you have got

00:24:45.779 --> 00:24:49.669
this Kundalini in your triangular bone, called
‘sacrum’.

00:24:49.669 --> 00:24:52.470
See, the word ‘sacrum’ means ‘sacred’.

00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:57.889
How did they know, the word ‘sacrum’ to
be put for this, is a sacred bone?

00:24:57.889 --> 00:25:03.210
This was discovered in ancient times, long,
long time back.

00:25:03.210 --> 00:25:09.450
Even they say that Indra was given Realisation
by Dattatreya.

00:25:09.450 --> 00:25:10.450
To that extent!

00:25:10.450 --> 00:25:12.740
I mean, how many years back it was done!

00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:14.590
But it was a guarded secret.

00:25:14.590 --> 00:25:18.549
It was done for very few people.

00:25:18.549 --> 00:25:20.700
Only it was Shankaracharya who started first.

00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:23.179
Adi Shankaracharya I would say, not these
[modern ones].

00:25:23.179 --> 00:25:27.950
But the Adi Shankaracharya started talking
about it so clearly.

00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:37.130
Everywhere you find, even in Koran or in the
Bible, everywhere it is said, any scripture

00:25:37.130 --> 00:25:48.179
which has lasted the time, it’s said that,
“You are to be born again."

00:25:48.179 --> 00:25:50.295
Now people have taken a note from that and
they certify, “I am a twice-born."

00:25:50.295 --> 00:25:52.970
Now what is the proof that you are twice-born?

00:25:52.970 --> 00:25:57.480
Everybody says, “I am a twice-born."

00:25:57.480 --> 00:26:00.029
It is absurd.

00:26:00.029 --> 00:26:01.490
What do you mean by twice-born?

00:26:01.490 --> 00:26:08.830
As I have told you before that a bird is called
as twice-born in Sanskrit language, and a

00:26:08.830 --> 00:26:14.059
Realised-soul is also called a twice-born.

00:26:14.059 --> 00:26:25.460
As the bird is an egg and, when the egg breaks,
we do not see the egg but we see the chick

00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:27.759
coming out of it.

00:26:27.759 --> 00:26:35.249
In the same way it has to happen to you that,
when your egg, which is made by the formation

00:26:35.249 --> 00:26:43.179
of ego and superego, the yellow and the blue
on your head, has to break and then you become

00:26:43.179 --> 00:26:51.980
a new personality, a personality which is
very different from what it was before.

00:26:51.980 --> 00:26:57.039
Egg doesn’t grow, does it?

00:26:57.039 --> 00:26:59.299
But the chick grows.

00:26:59.299 --> 00:27:05.850
Now the growth starts in the spiritual arena,
in the spiritual understanding, into spiritual

00:27:05.850 --> 00:27:06.850
education.

00:27:06.850 --> 00:27:08.889
Now it starts!

00:27:08.889 --> 00:27:12.860
Not before that.

00:27:12.860 --> 00:27:18.309
You start feeling the Divine Power around
and you understand that you are a universal

00:27:18.309 --> 00:27:19.309
being.

00:27:19.309 --> 00:27:31.840
All these nonsensical ideas, of race, of different
religions, of different communities, are products

00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:40.360
of human endeavour, or we should say the human
thinking; which is so stupid sometimes that

00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:45.869
it is impossible for a person like me to understand
why we have to carry a passport from places

00:27:45.869 --> 00:27:47.470
to places.

00:27:47.470 --> 00:27:55.399
The God Almighty also must be failing to understand
how this has been worked out by the great

00:27:55.399 --> 00:27:57.789
wise human beings.

00:27:57.789 --> 00:28:00.540
That He made only one world.

00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:03.290
He didn’t make many worlds.

00:28:03.290 --> 00:28:12.149
He just put some rivers and some nice mountains
and some hills and dales, to make it a beautiful,

00:28:12.149 --> 00:28:13.899
interesting place for you.

00:28:13.899 --> 00:28:24.220
And you have divided into nations and into
cities and villages and then into smaller

00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:32.440
places and then into a road and then into
your houses and then into your kitchen.

00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:38.279
That’s what we have become!

00:28:38.279 --> 00:28:44.190
But the category of the people about whom
I am saying, they can’t remain in their

00:28:44.190 --> 00:28:51.240
kitchens, they can’t remain in their houses,
they cannot remain in their nations.

00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:54.149
They transcend the whole Universe.

00:28:54.149 --> 00:28:57.799
They cover the whole Universe.

00:28:57.799 --> 00:29:00.570
Because they become universal beings.

00:29:00.570 --> 00:29:02.529
They cannot think in this terminology.

00:29:02.529 --> 00:29:04.679
It hurts them.

00:29:04.679 --> 00:29:05.679
It hurts them.

00:29:05.679 --> 00:29:10.889
You see, it would be like a great person being
put in a sack.

00:29:10.889 --> 00:29:17.139
You just force him to get into a sack or into
a cup – how he’ll be hurt?

00:29:17.139 --> 00:29:21.269
Either the cup will break or the fellow will
throw it away.

00:29:21.269 --> 00:29:27.369
It’s the ocean you are trying to put it
into a cup, which you cannot do it.

00:29:27.369 --> 00:29:32.100
And such a stupidity has been done so far.

00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:37.870
But the time has come for all the oceans to
be awakened to their greatness.

00:29:37.870 --> 00:29:47.279
And once they are awakened they will throw
away all these minor boundaries and all these

00:29:47.279 --> 00:29:58.860
nonsensical barriers that has created such
a mountain from one seed to another seed where

00:29:58.860 --> 00:30:08.350
two beautiful human beings are sitting and
are fragrant with the fragrance of universal

00:30:08.350 --> 00:30:09.460
joy.

00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:14.519
After Realisation only you can also enjoy
another personality.

00:30:14.519 --> 00:30:16.240
Normally you cannot.

00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:26.529
What you enjoy is his car, or his house or
his dress or his looks or his behaviour towards

00:30:26.529 --> 00:30:27.529
you.

00:30:27.529 --> 00:30:32.249
At the most his intellect, his success, his
horses.

00:30:32.249 --> 00:30:35.059
I don’t know what else.

00:30:35.059 --> 00:30:39.090
But after Realisation you just enjoy his vibrations!

00:30:39.090 --> 00:30:43.340
You just enjoy him in his innate thing.

00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:48.600
You do not see his age, you do not see his
caste, you do not see his race but you see

00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:54.769
all this chaitanya, these vibrations, coming
from the person and you just enjoy for hours

00:30:54.769 --> 00:30:57.049
together just feeling that.

00:30:57.049 --> 00:30:58.269
It’s so enjoyable.

00:30:58.269 --> 00:31:03.460
One person like that walks in, and all of
you, “Ah!”

00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:07.640
This should happen to everyone.

00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:11.100
It has to happen.

00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:13.559
The time has come for this happening.

00:31:13.559 --> 00:31:19.679
That’s why we have so many seekers.

00:31:19.679 --> 00:31:26.659
They have been ill-treated, they have been
deceived, they have been used, people have

00:31:26.659 --> 00:31:28.559
made money out of them.

00:31:28.559 --> 00:31:31.549
I accept [that].

00:31:31.549 --> 00:31:39.739
But then I have to accept also that in seeking
you had to be tested also, to see where do

00:31:39.739 --> 00:31:42.440
you stick on.

00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:46.830
If you want to go to the Truth, you will discard
everything [else].

00:31:46.830 --> 00:31:49.570
And once you come before the Truth you will
have it.

00:31:49.570 --> 00:31:57.500
And that’s why this testing has to be done,
because there is ego, human beings have their

00:31:57.500 --> 00:31:59.659
egos; they think, “Oh I will do this.

00:31:59.659 --> 00:32:00.789
I can do it.

00:32:00.789 --> 00:32:02.669
I can sort it out."

00:32:02.669 --> 00:32:03.669
Alright.

00:32:03.669 --> 00:32:05.100
God says, “Alright, have it.

00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:06.429
Have it your way."

00:32:06.429 --> 00:32:11.809
Then they will go and break their heads, break
their legs, break their hands and then come

00:32:11.809 --> 00:32:13.820
saying that, “Mother, see, I have broken
everything.

00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:14.950
Now what will you do?”

00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:15.950
So alright!

00:32:15.950 --> 00:32:17.770
The Sahaja Yoga has to work it out.

00:32:17.770 --> 00:32:20.530
But why do all that?

00:32:20.530 --> 00:32:23.020
Come straight to the Truth.

00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:30.879
Now, one has to understand that before Realisation
you don’t have to do anything, but after

00:32:30.879 --> 00:32:40.409
Realisation those who do not understand their
own esteem, they do not value their potentialities

00:32:40.409 --> 00:32:52.230
or their powers, can lose their vibrations
in the early months.

00:32:52.230 --> 00:32:57.249
It has happened with many people: they have
lost their vibrations completely because they

00:32:57.249 --> 00:32:58.909
have not paid any attention to themselves.

00:32:58.909 --> 00:33:01.330
They have not tried to improve themselves.

00:33:01.330 --> 00:33:03.769
They have not tried to keep up the vibrations.

00:33:03.769 --> 00:33:05.889
It’s like enlightening any light.

00:33:05.889 --> 00:33:12.860
We have to look after it for a while till
it takes its own form.

00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:19.909
And that is how in Sahaja Yoga so many come
and get Realisation, but those who grow are

00:33:19.909 --> 00:33:21.100
the real Sahaja yogis.

00:33:21.100 --> 00:33:24.299
The rest of them are wasted, are just wasted.

00:33:24.299 --> 00:33:30.019
They’ll come back again but they take too
much time and the Divine does not have interest

00:33:30.019 --> 00:33:34.980
in such people, it does not help such people.

00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:42.019
So I have to request to you, request you that
if you are seekers, you have to have your

00:33:42.019 --> 00:33:43.019
Realisation.

00:33:43.019 --> 00:33:44.590
Without that you will not be happy.

00:33:44.590 --> 00:33:55.509
But you must have full idea and responsibility
about yourself that you are now an enlightened

00:33:55.509 --> 00:33:56.889
light.

00:33:56.889 --> 00:34:02.279
You are a beacon and you cannot afford to
hide yourself.

00:34:02.279 --> 00:34:04.499
You have to give light to others.

00:34:04.499 --> 00:34:06.830
You have to work it out that way.

00:34:06.830 --> 00:34:16.220
It’s not now a question of only one Christ
bearing the cross or one Mohammed talking

00:34:16.220 --> 00:34:20.109
about the message or one Nanaka fighting the
whole world.

00:34:20.109 --> 00:34:25.339
It’s all of you put together have to fight
it out and work it out.

00:34:25.339 --> 00:34:26.549
That’s what it is today.

00:34:26.549 --> 00:34:31.050
That’s why Sahaja Yoga, one can say, has
reached the state of Mahayoga.

00:34:31.050 --> 00:34:35.750
“Sahaja”, Sahaja means born with you.

00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:37.310
It’s spontaneous.

00:34:37.310 --> 00:34:40.249
It is within you.

00:34:40.249 --> 00:34:42.070
The whole thing is within you.

00:34:42.070 --> 00:34:46.780
Just like a seed sprouts, the Kundalini sprouts
spontaneously.

00:34:46.780 --> 00:34:48.829
You do not have to do anything about it.

00:34:48.829 --> 00:34:56.339
But when it becomes Mahayoga, means it becomes
en masse, thousands of people can be given

00:34:56.339 --> 00:34:57.339
Realisation.

00:34:57.339 --> 00:35:05.140
In India we have someone who has given Realisation
to ten thousand people in a village!

00:35:05.140 --> 00:35:09.859
He is just a farmer and he has done it.

00:35:09.859 --> 00:35:13.550
So you can imagine how much you can do.

00:35:13.550 --> 00:35:20.880
But in the West, as I have always warned you,
it’s a very ego-oriented society, and people

00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:22.670
are very exclusive.

00:35:22.670 --> 00:35:23.670
Everybody wants to sort out.

00:35:23.670 --> 00:35:26.670
Immediately after Realisation everybody becomes
an Archbishop of Canterbury!

00:35:26.670 --> 00:35:34.460
And they think no end of themselves.

00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:38.420
You have to have spiritual knowledge after
this.

00:35:38.420 --> 00:35:40.740
You have to know everything about it.

00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:43.089
You have to master it.

00:35:43.089 --> 00:35:48.510
You have to master your body, you have to
master your mind and you have to master the

00:35:48.510 --> 00:35:50.670
whole art of Kundalini.

00:35:50.670 --> 00:35:54.670
Then only you can say that it works.

00:35:54.670 --> 00:35:58.130
Otherwise, it’s just a waste.

00:35:58.130 --> 00:36:04.109
You are the people who are in the foundation,
and you have to be the strongest people.

00:36:04.109 --> 00:36:09.430
You have to be the masters of Kundalini, absolutely
the masters of Kundalini.

00:36:09.430 --> 00:36:10.910
It’s not individual.

00:36:10.910 --> 00:36:13.000
This is Mahayoga.

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:19.940
Anybody who tries to be individualistic will
be lost, will be no more in the circulation.

00:36:19.940 --> 00:36:24.910
This I have told you hundred, and hundred
and one times.

00:36:24.910 --> 00:36:34.150
And the Spirit can only grow in collectivity
because the nature of Spirit is universal.

00:36:34.150 --> 00:36:36.420
You cannot achieve anything exclusively.

00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:40.790
Those who try it will fail.

00:36:40.790 --> 00:36:49.980
You all have to join together and should know
that you all awakened people.

00:36:49.980 --> 00:36:58.540
In the Primordial Being you are like the awakened
cells who know the Primordial Being and who

00:36:58.540 --> 00:37:07.380
have the powers by which they can communicate
the powers of God to other people.

00:37:07.380 --> 00:37:16.010
You all have to be absolutely one with each
other, not to find faults but to love and

00:37:16.010 --> 00:37:17.910
enjoy each other.

00:37:17.910 --> 00:37:21.619
That’s the best way you can move.

00:37:21.619 --> 00:37:30.750
As you know that this subject is so varied,
and it requires so much of explanation, for

00:37:30.750 --> 00:37:36.450
which now we have lots of tapes, and if you
people want you can get tapes from Douglas

00:37:36.450 --> 00:37:39.670
(Fry), who has really put in lot of effort
for it.

00:37:39.670 --> 00:37:50.380
You can play them and can understand and can
improve all your knowledge about Sahaja Yoga.

00:37:50.380 --> 00:37:56.109
And now I’ll be going to India and perhaps
there may be only one lecture more where it

00:37:56.109 --> 00:38:01.050
will be just a farewell function we’ll have.

00:38:01.050 --> 00:38:07.859
I would like some of the Sahaja Yogis to ask
some questions today, because it’s a nice

00:38:07.859 --> 00:38:11.450
opportunity for you to ask some questions.

00:38:11.450 --> 00:38:15.319
But not the people who haven’t got Realisation,
because those who haven’t got Realisation

00:38:15.319 --> 00:38:17.799
are not entitled because they do not know.

00:38:17.799 --> 00:38:20.240
They have no news about it.

00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:21.460
They don’t understand.

00:38:21.460 --> 00:38:23.940
They should not ask any questions.

00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:25.829
Those who are Sahaja Yogis should ask.

00:38:25.829 --> 00:38:31.099
I mean, it would be something like those who
have never visited India, are asking questions

00:38:31.099 --> 00:38:32.099
about India.

00:38:32.099 --> 00:38:39.581
Better go to India, find out about [it] yourself,
see it in deeply, how it is, what it is, and

00:38:39.581 --> 00:38:41.350
then you can ask questions.

00:38:41.350 --> 00:38:46.680
Not just visit Delhi talk to some Westernised
Indians and come back and tell me stories

00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:47.680
about them!

00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:53.940
In the same way, those who have not been to
England, meet some of the politicians or something

00:38:53.940 --> 00:39:02.240
like that, go back and tell something about
England which I will not believe and you should

00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:03.240
not believe.

00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:09.910
You have to understand the country on a philosophical
level, on philosophy – where are they.

00:39:09.910 --> 00:39:16.400
And unless and until you understand that subtle
thing, you cannot say anything about it.

00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:23.290
For example, for England, I have always said
that the young generation of England are the

00:39:23.290 --> 00:39:24.640
best in the whole world.

00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:31.319
Take it from me, whether they are English,
or whatever it is, whatever nationality, but

00:39:31.319 --> 00:39:35.460
the young generation that are English are
the best.

00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:37.390
No doubt about it.

00:39:37.390 --> 00:39:43.760
Because they have developed, no doubt, but
they have kept their wisdom intact.

00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:48.010
India, the young people are developing and
they have to go through all your discotheques

00:39:48.010 --> 00:39:52.490
and all those rumble-tumbles, till they come
to the stage where they’ll take alcohols

00:39:52.490 --> 00:39:58.880
and then they will take to your drugs and
then they might take to [seeking].

00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:00.640
Americans are too shifty.

00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:04.490
They have not kept their wisdom intact.

00:40:04.490 --> 00:40:13.320
(laughter) But thanks to the tradition of
British, that you have kept your traditions

00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:19.640
still intact and you know about your country
because it’s a small country.

00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:24.490
So I depend very much on the English youth.

00:40:24.490 --> 00:40:28.040
But if you ask anyone else, they will say,
“Oh, these English youth [are] extremely

00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:29.700
rude, arrogant.

00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:32.200
Good for nothing!

00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:33.869
Drugged, lethargic.

00:40:33.869 --> 00:40:34.869
Useless!”

00:40:34.869 --> 00:40:40.970
But I have seen now young people and young
people all over the world and this is what

00:40:40.970 --> 00:40:43.160
I have to say about them.

00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:46.790
Now I would like you to ask me questions.

00:40:46.790 --> 00:40:57.000
First the Sahaja yogis, then we can ask the
non-Sahaja yogis.

00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:59.020
Difficult.

00:40:59.020 --> 00:41:04.960
You have become thoughtless, actually, you
cannot ask!

00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:08.049
This is the trick of Sahaja Yoga!

00:41:08.049 --> 00:41:11.730
When it crosses this point, you cannot think.

00:41:11.730 --> 00:41:18.970
Even if you want to think, you cannot.

00:41:18.970 --> 00:41:23.339
No questions?

00:41:23.339 --> 00:41:25.460
Now non-sahaja yogis, please.

00:41:25.460 --> 00:41:30.630
Seeker: How about times when you should do
the meditation?

00:41:30.630 --> 00:41:31.630
What sort of times?

00:41:31.630 --> 00:41:32.630
Shri Mataji: Oh, there’s nothing.

00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:33.630
No rules.

00:41:33.630 --> 00:41:34.630
You go beyond time.

00:41:34.630 --> 00:41:35.630
Every time you are in meditation only.

00:41:35.630 --> 00:41:38.230
You see, what is meditation?

00:41:38.230 --> 00:41:40.380
You cannot do meditation, you have to be in
meditation.

00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:41.380
You become meditative.

00:41:41.380 --> 00:41:43.010
You are all the time in meditation.

00:41:43.010 --> 00:41:52.260
I mean, there is no time when you are not,
because you become a different person.

00:41:52.260 --> 00:41:56.690
Those people who do meditation, I don’t
know how they do it.

00:41:56.690 --> 00:41:57.790
Really, I can’t understand.

00:41:57.790 --> 00:42:01.099
Because which is the way you enter into the
realm of meditation?

00:42:01.099 --> 00:42:07.740
Unless and until the Kundalini takes your
attention to that state,you cannot meditate.

00:42:07.740 --> 00:42:08.740
So how can you do?

00:42:08.740 --> 00:42:12.900
You cannot lift the Kundalini with your hand
and put Her there.

00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:15.200
No lift can work it out.

00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:20.270
It’s only through spontaneous awakening
that the Kundalini rises.

00:42:20.270 --> 00:42:22.300
So you cannot do meditation.

00:42:22.300 --> 00:42:26.960
And once you are there, you are there.

00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:29.460
So there is no timing.

00:42:29.460 --> 00:42:30.680
Nothing fixed.

00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:35.920
But it depends on the kind of a person they
are.

00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:46.280
For example, say somebody who gets up [at]
eleven o’clock in the morning, doesn’t

00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:55.230
brush his teeth, rushes to the office, comes
back home, sleeps at two o’clock in the

00:42:55.230 --> 00:42:59.849
night, can’t sleep before two o’clock,
then such a person has to develop certain

00:42:59.849 --> 00:43:01.599
habits.

00:43:01.599 --> 00:43:05.780
Because we have to neutralise the habits that
we have had.

00:43:05.780 --> 00:43:09.920
So maybe that time we will have to just turn
the tables, and we can manage.

00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:12.619
We can change all our habits.

00:43:12.619 --> 00:43:17.900
And we can have such habits by which we neutralise
our old habits.

00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:20.880
It depends on what sort of a person it is.

00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:25.940
For example, we Indians have a bad habit of
getting up very early in the morning and having

00:43:25.940 --> 00:43:28.289
a bath in the morning.

00:43:28.289 --> 00:43:32.490
Whether it is England, America or even if
we are with Eskimos, we’ll do that!

00:43:32.490 --> 00:43:33.490
That’s typical.

00:43:33.490 --> 00:43:35.289
Otherwise, we don’t feel happy.

00:43:35.289 --> 00:43:40.300
Just before going to the office, we’ll take
our baths and walk out in the cold.

00:43:40.300 --> 00:43:45.250
I mean, it is the greatest punishment for
an Indian to say, “You don’t take your

00:43:45.250 --> 00:43:46.250
bath."

00:43:46.250 --> 00:43:49.390
I mean, after coming to England some of them
have reconciled.

00:43:49.390 --> 00:43:56.710
And to take bath in the night and sleep, they
can’t believe it, they just don’t know

00:43:56.710 --> 00:43:58.180
what it is.

00:43:58.180 --> 00:44:01.150
So they get lung troubles.

00:44:01.150 --> 00:44:02.930
Some of them have got lung cancer.

00:44:02.930 --> 00:44:08.510
One of the common diseases I’ve seen amongst
Indians is what you call the, we call it the

00:44:08.510 --> 00:44:13.299
heart chakras, the, the cardiac plexus catching;
common.

00:44:13.299 --> 00:44:20.710
The reason is this, that, they have no consideration
about the temperature outside.

00:44:20.710 --> 00:44:25.609
Now if you tell them, they can’t believe
me.

00:44:25.609 --> 00:44:28.579
They think a religious person must take his
bath every day.

00:44:28.579 --> 00:44:31.860
That’s the idea they have.

00:44:31.860 --> 00:44:33.080
Not in England.

00:44:33.080 --> 00:44:38.829
I mean, you can take your bath every day,
but not the bath and just walk out [of the

00:44:38.829 --> 00:44:39.829
house].

00:44:39.829 --> 00:44:47.720
Then I have to tell, “Can you have you bath,
say, thrice a week or four times a week, if

00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:48.720
possible?”

00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:53.849
But to an Englishmen, you better get up at
four o’clock and have your bath!

00:44:53.849 --> 00:44:55.720
It depends on who you are.

00:44:55.720 --> 00:45:04.180
So there is nothing like having a fixed thing
in Sahaja Yoga.

00:45:04.180 --> 00:45:08.970
It depends on what sort of a person you have,
what habits are there, what are your loopholes,

00:45:08.970 --> 00:45:10.099
what are your weaknesses.

00:45:10.099 --> 00:45:11.859
So we have to look after that.

00:45:11.859 --> 00:45:15.309
Like, it’s very common practice, you know.

00:45:15.309 --> 00:45:19.940
Supposing we have to go to my house from here.

00:45:19.940 --> 00:45:23.430
Now you don’t know how to go, so you see
the map and whichever way you have to go,

00:45:23.430 --> 00:45:24.440
you just go.

00:45:24.440 --> 00:45:26.640
It’s a new life.

00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:28.830
It’s a new map.

00:45:28.830 --> 00:45:31.030
So you have to see which way you have to go.

00:45:31.030 --> 00:45:34.619
You change accordingly and you go accordingly.

00:45:34.619 --> 00:45:37.690
You cannot have fixed idea now, anymore.

00:45:37.690 --> 00:45:39.420
You have to see.

00:45:39.420 --> 00:45:45.369
If your car has got a trouble with its brake,
better is to repair the brake, isn’t it?

00:45:45.369 --> 00:45:47.300
Or will you say that, “Doesn’t matter.

00:45:47.300 --> 00:45:51.880
Even [if] my brake is bad, I’ll go ahead.

00:45:51.880 --> 00:45:54.940
As long as my tyres are alright, I don’t
care for the brake."

00:45:54.940 --> 00:45:56.220
Sahaja Yoga is just opposite.

00:45:56.220 --> 00:46:01.710
If the brake is not alright, don’t worry
about the tyres, but think about the brake.

00:46:01.710 --> 00:46:04.780
It’s very discretionary.

00:46:04.780 --> 00:46:09.950
You become very discrete about yourself and
you start repairing your car; that’s yourself.

00:46:09.950 --> 00:46:13.870
Because you get out of your car and you see
the problems.

00:46:13.870 --> 00:46:17.650
You are not identified anymore with you.

00:46:17.650 --> 00:46:21.950
For example, Don would come and tell Me, “Mother,
I am catching on my Agnya here."

00:46:21.950 --> 00:46:23.460
Now what does that mean?

00:46:23.460 --> 00:46:25.650
It means actually Ego.

00:46:25.650 --> 00:46:30.670
But he will have no objection in telling me
or he will in no way feel ashamed to tell

00:46:30.670 --> 00:46:34.180
me that, “My ego is like a balloon here
coming up Mother.

00:46:34.180 --> 00:46:36.290
Better solve the problem."

00:46:36.290 --> 00:46:42.289
You see your ego so clearly and you want to
get rid of it.

00:46:42.289 --> 00:46:44.140
Anybody would do that.

00:46:44.140 --> 00:46:50.030
But if you tell somebody before Realisation,
“You have got ego,” you’ve had it.

00:46:50.030 --> 00:46:53.920
I have never done that and none of you should
do.

00:46:53.920 --> 00:46:56.410
Let them feel the Agnya after Realisation.

00:46:56.410 --> 00:46:58.980
They come and tell you and you move it.

00:46:58.980 --> 00:47:03.089
In the same way, any other trouble, even for
diseases, if you tell somebody that, “You

00:47:03.089 --> 00:47:06.400
have such disease,” he may jump down from
here with fear.

00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:12.470
In Sahaja Yoga you come to know about the
diseases much, much before any doctors know,

00:47:12.470 --> 00:47:16.410
because on your fingers you can feel it.

00:47:16.410 --> 00:47:18.500
But you don’t have to tell the person at
all.

00:47:18.500 --> 00:47:20.319
You just talk in your code language.

00:47:20.319 --> 00:47:22.510
What is catching?

00:47:22.510 --> 00:47:23.529
You tell, “This is catching.

00:47:23.529 --> 00:47:25.250
Ekadasha Rudra is catching."

00:47:25.250 --> 00:47:27.150
Alright, what does that mean?

00:47:27.150 --> 00:47:30.339
That is the beginning of the cancer.

00:47:30.339 --> 00:47:32.720
There’s already for it.

00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:33.720
So Ekadasha.

00:47:33.720 --> 00:47:37.040
Clear out the Ekadasha Rudra, is all here
(pointing to forehead).

00:47:37.040 --> 00:47:41.150
Now nobody knows what Ekadasha Rudra is, except
for the Sahaja yogis.

00:47:41.150 --> 00:47:45.630
And they know there is no danger because it
is curable.

00:47:45.630 --> 00:47:46.630
So they clear it out.

00:47:46.630 --> 00:47:53.359
That’s the beginning of a personality, where
he starts getting into this trouble or that

00:47:53.359 --> 00:47:54.359
trouble.

00:47:54.359 --> 00:48:02.480
And say left Agnya is catching, is a sign
that he is going lunatic asylum and little

00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:03.480
combinations.

00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:07.410
You don’t have to tell the person but you
can save him from going to lunatic asylum.

00:48:07.410 --> 00:48:09.890
He need never go.

00:48:09.890 --> 00:48:14.319
People have come down to our program to lunatic
asylum and when they went back, they were

00:48:14.319 --> 00:48:16.039
told, “You better not come up here."

00:48:16.039 --> 00:48:18.180
It can happen like that.

00:48:18.180 --> 00:48:19.830
It’s very simple.

00:48:19.830 --> 00:48:21.770
It is so simple, you can’t imagine.

00:48:21.770 --> 00:48:26.950
The whole thing is so simple but you have
to learn what it is.

00:48:26.950 --> 00:48:29.510
You can cure people.

00:48:29.510 --> 00:48:31.160
You can help your atmosphere.

00:48:31.160 --> 00:48:33.859
You can do lots of things.

00:48:33.859 --> 00:48:39.320
The greatest of all that you become the collective
being.

00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:40.880
So it changes.

00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:42.340
There’s no time, nothing.

00:48:42.340 --> 00:48:44.160
You are a free bird.

00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:45.260
It’s all freedom.

00:48:45.260 --> 00:48:46.359
There’s no bondage.

00:48:46.359 --> 00:48:48.210
You yourself want to sit down meditating.

00:48:48.210 --> 00:48:55.579
Now I came here, I was supposed to talk and
start my speech but I was enjoying my meditation

00:48:55.579 --> 00:48:58.940
so much so I went into that.

00:48:58.940 --> 00:49:07.630
All the time you are in meditation mood and
you can enjoy it anytime you want to

00:49:07.630 --> 00:49:13.059
Seeker: Do you hope to come back to England
in the near future?

00:49:13.059 --> 00:49:15.569
Shri Mataji: No, no, I am stationed here.

00:49:15.569 --> 00:49:24.890
Absolutely, I am glued to this place for five
years more!

00:49:24.890 --> 00:49:27.340
And I am going to come back very soon.

00:49:27.340 --> 00:49:33.369
I am there only for two months, or one month
I will be going to Australia.

00:49:33.369 --> 00:49:36.470
So [after] three months altogether, I’m
back.

00:49:36.470 --> 00:49:42.279
I’m sure even when I go back after five
years, your government won’t object [to]

00:49:42.279 --> 00:49:43.279
my coming here.

00:49:43.279 --> 00:49:45.280
I hope so by that time.

00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:47.730
So, it’s just I had to come here.

00:49:47.730 --> 00:49:51.089
I have been now here seven years and five
years more.

00:49:51.089 --> 00:49:53.210
Twelve years!

00:49:53.210 --> 00:49:56.390
Can you imagine?

00:49:56.390 --> 00:49:57.460
Alright?

00:49:57.460 --> 00:50:01.059
That should set you alright.

00:50:01.059 --> 00:50:04.299
That was one of the fears is it?

00:50:04.299 --> 00:50:05.299
No.

00:50:05.299 --> 00:50:06.299
Now is it alright for all of you?

00:50:06.299 --> 00:50:07.299
Anyone else?

00:50:07.299 --> 00:50:10.020
Sahaja Yogi: You can tell us something about
dharma Mother.

00:50:10.020 --> 00:50:11.030
Shri Mataji: Dharma?

00:50:11.030 --> 00:50:12.040
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.

00:50:12.040 --> 00:50:18.460
Shri Mataji: There’s a, there’s a tape
on dharma and on Guru which you can see.

00:50:18.460 --> 00:50:31.750
Dharma is the sustenance which is established
by an aspect of God in our stomach.

00:50:31.750 --> 00:50:34.589
Our stomach teaches us our dharma.

00:50:34.589 --> 00:50:40.760
“Dharayati sa dharmaha”, means the one
you sustain is your dharma.

00:50:40.760 --> 00:50:49.250
For example, the dharma of gold is that it
is untarnishable.

00:50:49.250 --> 00:50:53.160
The dharma of carbon is [that] it has got
four valencies.

00:50:53.160 --> 00:51:00.430
If you have seen the periodic laws of chemistry,
you will know that all the elements have got

00:51:00.430 --> 00:51:03.040
their own dharmas.

00:51:03.040 --> 00:51:08.779
And they are given these dharmas by the law
of God.

00:51:08.779 --> 00:51:13.880
It’s the Divine Law which has given them
these dharmas.

00:51:13.880 --> 00:51:25.180
Up to the stage of human beings the dharma
of a person or of any animal, or of any element,

00:51:25.180 --> 00:51:30.299
is determined absolutely by divine laws and
they do not cross it.

00:51:30.299 --> 00:51:35.200
For example, a lion will behave like a lion.

00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:37.930
He cannot behave like a cat.

00:51:37.930 --> 00:51:44.190
A scorpion will behave like itself.

00:51:44.190 --> 00:51:47.119
It cannot behave like a lion.

00:51:47.119 --> 00:51:50.850
A tiger will behave like a tiger.

00:51:50.850 --> 00:51:57.880
Tiger is the king and he won’t eat anything
killed by another animal.

00:51:57.880 --> 00:52:03.539
Only when he is hungry, he kills the animal
and he eats whatever he likes in one gulp

00:52:03.539 --> 00:52:06.360
and then he rests and others come and eat
that.

00:52:06.360 --> 00:52:16.030
He won’t eat anything that is eaten by others
and he won’t kill anything that he need

00:52:16.030 --> 00:52:17.030
not kill.

00:52:17.030 --> 00:52:18.030
He’s the king.

00:52:18.030 --> 00:52:25.900
That’s why if one tiger is killed in a forest
the whole forest seems so gloomy.

00:52:25.900 --> 00:52:28.049
Because their king has been killed.

00:52:28.049 --> 00:52:30.420
Though he’s a terror for them.

00:52:30.420 --> 00:52:36.920
But he lives with his own dharma, with his
own boundaries.

00:52:36.920 --> 00:52:38.930
He doesn’t cross his boundaries.

00:52:38.930 --> 00:52:44.829
Any one of these, up to the human level, have
their own dharmas.

00:52:44.829 --> 00:52:54.250
Only the human beings have been given the
freedom to cross the dharma, they can.

00:52:54.250 --> 00:53:02.350
I mean, in a human being, you can find a lion,
you can find a serpent and you can find also

00:53:02.350 --> 00:53:04.109
a worm.

00:53:04.109 --> 00:53:08.579
You can find the combination of all that in
one person or in the whole group you’ll

00:53:08.579 --> 00:53:12.549
find all kinds.

00:53:12.549 --> 00:53:15.760
But if they want they can transcend.

00:53:15.760 --> 00:53:19.290
And the greatest thing is [that] they can
transcend the dharma itself.

00:53:19.290 --> 00:53:25.589
Means they become so great that they can be
sinless.

00:53:25.589 --> 00:53:29.170
Just they can’t do any sins.

00:53:29.170 --> 00:53:31.500
These dharmas are established within you.

00:53:31.500 --> 00:53:35.539
These Ten Commandments are there within us.

00:53:35.539 --> 00:53:42.720
If you try to transgress them you are losing
your dharma, your sustenance, beyond which

00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:44.900
you have to rise.

00:53:44.900 --> 00:53:50.230
For Realisation, you have to rise beyond dharma,
dharmateet – beyond.

00:53:50.230 --> 00:53:54.299
But first your dharma must be established.

00:53:54.299 --> 00:53:57.440
If it is not established, you cannot rise.

00:53:57.440 --> 00:54:05.440
But in Sahaja Yoga, even [if] your dharma
is disturbed it’s forgiven.

00:54:05.440 --> 00:54:08.549
Still you can get your Realisation.

00:54:08.549 --> 00:54:10.700
Then you establish your dharma.

00:54:10.700 --> 00:54:12.300
It’s better.

00:54:12.300 --> 00:54:16.461
Because it has been seen [that] those people
who tried to establish their dharmas can become

00:54:16.461 --> 00:54:23.920
extremely, extremely dry.

00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:24.920
They can be fanatics.

00:54:24.920 --> 00:54:25.920
The compassion part of it is lost.

00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:35.089
So the compassion itself works in such a way
that all adharmas you have done, whatever

00:54:35.089 --> 00:54:37.660
you have done is forgiven.

00:54:37.660 --> 00:54:41.839
And you better have your Realisation and with
that power you establish your dharma.

00:54:41.839 --> 00:54:44.690
And you have to establish it.

00:54:44.690 --> 00:54:50.940
For example, you know that alcohol goes against
your awareness.

00:54:50.940 --> 00:54:54.819
Awareness is the main thing, which is enlivened,
enriched by dharma.

00:54:54.819 --> 00:54:59.579
The human awareness goes down through alcohol,
you know [this] for definite.

00:54:59.579 --> 00:55:08.099
All the great saints who have looked after
the dharma, the prophets, have said against

00:55:08.099 --> 00:55:11.020
alcohol and against smoking.

00:55:11.020 --> 00:55:16.359
Mohammed Saheb did not say about smoking because
they did not have smoking.

00:55:16.359 --> 00:55:19.720
But the same person came as Nanaka.

00:55:19.720 --> 00:55:27.109
As Guru Nanaka he has prohibited, absolutely
prohibited anything that intoxicates you,

00:55:27.109 --> 00:55:29.890
your awareness.

00:55:29.890 --> 00:55:33.430
Because they knew that it will harm you very
much.

00:55:33.430 --> 00:55:36.210
It does harm you.

00:55:36.210 --> 00:55:38.789
You lose the chances of your Realisation very
much.

00:55:38.789 --> 00:55:43.950
It is true that it is injurious.

00:55:43.950 --> 00:55:47.680
One thing as alcoholism, I am saying.

00:55:47.680 --> 00:55:56.720
There can be something else people do, like
thieving or anything like that, is against

00:55:56.720 --> 00:55:58.210
your sustenance.

00:55:58.210 --> 00:56:06.250
But Sahaja Yoga is a method by which you first
get your Realisation and then your dharma

00:56:06.250 --> 00:56:11.839
is to be established so that you are empowered
by itself.

00:56:11.839 --> 00:56:17.599
For example, I never tell people, “Don’t
drink,” because half of the people would

00:56:17.599 --> 00:56:20.710
walk out, even Indians.

00:56:20.710 --> 00:56:26.260
They just drink like – I don’t know – fishes.

00:56:26.260 --> 00:56:30.799
I don’t know if fishes drink, but human
beings do!

00:56:30.799 --> 00:56:35.560
And then if I tell them, they will be very
angry.

00:56:35.560 --> 00:56:40.230
We had a doctor here who used to drink who
came to me.

00:56:40.230 --> 00:56:44.930
He got his Realisation and he went to Germany.

00:56:44.930 --> 00:56:49.350
And he was fond of a kind of a wine, a special
wine they make in Germany.

00:56:49.350 --> 00:56:51.140
He said, “Let me try some of this."

00:56:51.140 --> 00:56:54.569
He had given up because you don’t remember
that you have to drink.

00:56:54.569 --> 00:56:56.869
You never get bored enough to drink!

00:56:56.869 --> 00:57:00.470
You see, you feel, “What’s the use of
getting up and getting a glass and all that?

00:57:00.470 --> 00:57:01.559
I am enjoying myself.

00:57:01.559 --> 00:57:02.559
Why to do?”

00:57:02.559 --> 00:57:04.299
You are never bored of your company.

00:57:04.299 --> 00:57:07.840
You enjoy yourself so much that you don’t
want any drink.

00:57:07.840 --> 00:57:12.760
Like when you get the nectar of life, why
should you get after these horrible things?

00:57:12.760 --> 00:57:15.079
You just don’t do it.

00:57:15.079 --> 00:57:16.859
But this doctor thought, “Oh, how can that
be?

00:57:16.859 --> 00:57:19.650
I may have forgotten but today I’ll have
it."

00:57:19.650 --> 00:57:21.549
So he walked into a pub and asked for the
thing.

00:57:21.549 --> 00:57:24.019
He drank.

00:57:24.019 --> 00:57:27.750
After that he had such a pain, he vomited
all that.

00:57:27.750 --> 00:57:34.619
And he told me, “The same wine which I used
to enjoy, started smelling like cork to me.

00:57:34.619 --> 00:57:37.980
As if cork has been pushed into my tongue.

00:57:37.980 --> 00:57:42.190
I just couldn’t bear it and I vomited and
I had pain in the stomach.

00:57:42.190 --> 00:57:43.520
Mother what is this?”

00:57:43.520 --> 00:57:46.520
I said, “Alright, it’s good!”

00:57:46.520 --> 00:57:48.430
You cannot do then adharma.

00:57:48.430 --> 00:57:51.539
You just cannot do it.

00:57:51.539 --> 00:57:52.599
You just become dharma.

00:57:52.599 --> 00:57:56.210
You just cannot do it even if you try.

00:57:56.210 --> 00:57:57.420
It just works.

00:57:57.420 --> 00:58:04.410
I mean, there are people here, at least fifty
percent people, who have been druggists and

00:58:04.410 --> 00:58:05.410
chemists!

00:58:05.410 --> 00:58:06.410
Absolutely!

00:58:06.410 --> 00:58:09.390
They have given [up] drugs just like that.

00:58:09.390 --> 00:58:13.010
Just like that they have given [up] drugs.

00:58:13.010 --> 00:58:15.970
Of course, they had to get over the after-effects
of drugs.

00:58:15.970 --> 00:58:16.970
That’s different.

00:58:16.970 --> 00:58:21.930
But as far as giving up is concerned, no problem
at all, no problem of any kind.

00:58:21.930 --> 00:58:25.859
I didn’t have to tell them even, it just
happened.

00:58:25.859 --> 00:58:32.000
Dharma is established within you, because
when the light is there you see what it is.

00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:38.250
But this seeing is not what you understand
before Realisation – is through your rational

00:58:38.250 --> 00:58:45.420
being or through your sense organs – but
is a happening within you where you become

00:58:45.420 --> 00:58:48.420
that, you just feel it.

00:58:48.420 --> 00:58:52.230
You just can’t help it.

00:58:52.230 --> 00:58:57.980
That should happen; is the best, because human
beings otherwise are difficult.

00:58:57.980 --> 00:59:01.809
They find it difficult to maintain it.

00:59:01.809 --> 00:59:04.819
Now, I mean, everything they surpassed.

00:59:04.819 --> 00:59:09.440
First they use to say, “What about our social
relationships?”

00:59:09.440 --> 00:59:15.869
Their social relationships have improved,
their jobs have improved, their all material

00:59:15.869 --> 00:59:16.869
things have improved.

00:59:16.869 --> 00:59:21.609
If you don’t drink, I mean you save fifty
percent of your money as it is!

00:59:21.609 --> 00:59:24.350
[It’s] practical apart from anything else!

00:59:24.350 --> 00:59:33.750
But, according to Sahaja Yoga it’s much
subtler because the power of maintaining our

00:59:33.750 --> 00:59:38.160
material well-being is called as Lakshmi.

00:59:38.160 --> 00:59:44.170
And this Lakshmi is a very powerful deity
or a very powerful thing.

00:59:44.170 --> 00:59:51.260
But, alcoholism, alcohol is one thing or any
such things like drugs and all that, as soon

00:59:51.260 --> 00:59:56.270
as she sees entering into the being, she just
disappears.

00:59:56.270 --> 00:59:59.040
She just can’t bear it.

00:59:59.040 --> 01:00:05.990
So a person may think that by drinking he
doesn’t lose his money [but] he is sadly

01:00:05.990 --> 01:00:06.990
mistaken.

01:00:06.990 --> 01:00:12.319
If he does not drink he will have ten times
more money than he has.

01:00:12.319 --> 01:00:18.559
And you can see the result today that, when
Englishmen were known in India, Englishmen’s

01:00:18.559 --> 01:00:22.400
whisky meant this much, every night; that’s
all.

01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:26.930
Today if you see the same thing in third generation,
you’ll be shocked.

01:00:26.930 --> 01:00:31.410
I mean, first time I came to England I was
surprised because to us Englishmen means one

01:00:31.410 --> 01:00:36.369
peck, so little, before sleeping, very decent.

01:00:36.369 --> 01:00:40.119
That’s what we thought they were gentlemen
of that calibre.

01:00:40.119 --> 01:00:42.890
But when I saw here, I was surprised.

01:00:42.890 --> 01:00:44.280
“Oh, God, what is this?

01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:45.510
What Englishmen are these?”

01:00:45.510 --> 01:00:48.480
So this happens in [the] third generation.

01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:56.309
If alcoholism somehow or other reduces in
England you can surpass all the economic problems;

01:00:56.309 --> 01:00:59.190
take it from me.

01:00:59.190 --> 01:01:00.190
Absolutely!

01:01:00.190 --> 01:01:03.500
You’ll solve all your economics.

01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:05.170
Just stop alcohols.

01:01:05.170 --> 01:01:08.810
All your strikes will stop because they want
money for what?

01:01:08.810 --> 01:01:11.970
For alcohols only.

01:01:11.970 --> 01:01:14.150
If you get money – have an alcohol.

01:01:14.150 --> 01:01:16.119
Somebody dies – have champagne.

01:01:16.119 --> 01:01:18.079
Somebody passes – champagne.

01:01:18.079 --> 01:01:19.910
Somebody married – champagne.

01:01:19.910 --> 01:01:23.799
For everything there is a champagne!

01:01:23.799 --> 01:01:27.260
Even in the church you see barrels and barrels
of whisky flowing in.

01:01:27.260 --> 01:01:29.990
Barrels and barrels of this thing is flowing
in.

01:01:29.990 --> 01:01:31.920
In mean, even in the church!

01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:39.030
Now today somebody told me that he’s got
a special wine from a Catholic church, which

01:01:39.030 --> 01:01:41.970
is called as Benedicts and is a special one.

01:01:41.970 --> 01:01:43.829
I said, “Where did you buy that?”

01:01:43.829 --> 01:01:45.059
He said, “In Rome, in the Vatican.

01:01:45.059 --> 01:01:46.819
You can only get it there, the best!”

01:01:46.819 --> 01:01:58.160
I was surprised that you can only get it in
Vatican and he was so proud of it and he was

01:01:58.160 --> 01:01:59.640
showing me that!

01:01:59.640 --> 01:02:03.089
And now it is called as ‘Benedict’.

01:02:03.089 --> 01:02:04.089
Just imagine!

01:02:04.089 --> 01:02:05.089
‘Benediction’.

01:02:05.089 --> 01:02:08.609
‘Benediction’ is that which gives you
Realisation.

01:02:08.609 --> 01:02:11.270
What Realisation does the drinking give you?

01:02:11.270 --> 01:02:12.300
I don’t know.

01:02:12.300 --> 01:02:17.740
Only thing I have seen [is] that people fall
on the streets, they talk like stupid people.

01:02:17.740 --> 01:02:20.480
You don’t know what to do with them.

01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:22.009
It’s most embarrassing.

01:02:22.009 --> 01:02:29.059
So this is what is dharma is, that is just
enlightens you and you enjoy your virtues.

01:02:29.059 --> 01:02:32.670
Not your weaknesses but your virtues.

01:02:32.670 --> 01:02:33.950
And you enjoy the virtues of others.

01:02:33.950 --> 01:02:37.640
That’s what is dharma that has to be enlightened.

01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:40.150
May God Bless you!

01:02:40.150 --> 01:02:44.420
You have to just put your hands just like
this, just like this.

01:02:44.420 --> 01:02:50.599
Put both the feet on the ground.

01:02:50.599 --> 01:02:53.740
Please close your eyes.

01:02:53.740 --> 01:02:59.720
According to the way the Kundalini is moving,
which I know on my own Kundalini, I will ask

01:02:59.720 --> 01:03:01.150
you a few things.

01:03:01.150 --> 01:03:09.780
Please try to do them with earnestness and
alertness.

01:03:09.780 --> 01:03:14.590
Now, I have to request you to forgive everyone.

01:03:14.590 --> 01:03:19.190
Forgive everyone: those who have troubled
you, tortured you, have made you unhappy,

01:03:19.190 --> 01:03:20.190
anyone.

01:03:20.190 --> 01:03:21.190
You just say, “I forgive."

01:03:21.190 --> 01:03:22.190
Is very important.

01:03:22.190 --> 01:03:24.839
Just try to forgive.

01:03:24.839 --> 01:03:26.950
Say, “I forgive.

01:03:26.950 --> 01:03:29.069
Mother, I forgive.

01:03:29.069 --> 01:03:39.430
I forgive all of them, all the people who
have tortured me."

01:03:39.430 --> 01:03:42.059
Just say that from your heart.

01:03:42.059 --> 01:03:45.400
Please say that, “I forgive."

01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:48.089
Please close your eyes.

01:03:48.089 --> 01:03:52.740
You have to be honest to yourself.

01:03:52.740 --> 01:03:55.759
Just say that, “I forgive."

01:03:55.759 --> 01:03:58.089
Only saying is sufficient.

01:03:58.089 --> 01:03:59.509
Only saying.

01:03:59.509 --> 01:04:02.059
But say with the heart.

01:04:02.059 --> 01:04:09.130
It will help you a lot if you can say that.

01:04:09.130 --> 01:04:11.400
Forgive everyone.

01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:14.819
Everyone you forgive.

01:04:14.819 --> 01:04:20.470
When you forgive everyone, actually you leave
it into the hands of God to punish them or

01:04:20.470 --> 01:04:21.470
do whatever they like.

01:04:21.470 --> 01:04:23.660
And that’s the best [way] to manage the
thing.

01:04:23.660 --> 01:04:25.589
Just say, “I forgive."

01:04:25.589 --> 01:04:35.009
Best thing is to leave it to God to do the
job whatever it is.

01:04:35.009 --> 01:04:44.980
You don’t take the load.

01:04:44.980 --> 01:04:46.940
They may be nasty.

01:04:46.940 --> 01:04:48.900
They may be horrid.

01:04:48.900 --> 01:04:50.960
They might have tortured you.

01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:51.960
Doesn’t matter.

01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:52.960
Just say.

01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:54.769
Even Christ said that.

01:04:54.769 --> 01:04:57.150
Just again, please say it.

01:04:57.150 --> 01:05:09.830
Close your eyes and say it, because if you
do not forgive also, what do you do?

01:05:09.830 --> 01:05:12.950
You are playing into their hands.

01:05:12.950 --> 01:05:21.380
Nothing is harmed, they are not harmed by
your not forgiving them.

01:05:21.380 --> 01:05:23.870
It’s you [who] are harmed.

01:05:23.870 --> 01:05:28.500
Because you are remembering all that, you
are harming yourself.

01:05:28.500 --> 01:05:29.500
You are tortured by that.

01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:30.990
You are torturing yourself not they.

01:05:30.990 --> 01:05:36.150
Now the second thing you have to ask [for]
is the forgiveness, yourself.

01:05:36.150 --> 01:05:37.500
Because might be some mistakes must have been
committed.

01:05:37.500 --> 01:05:39.009
By mistake you might have done something wrong,
something unrighteous.

01:05:39.009 --> 01:05:46.030
In seeking, you might have done something
wrong.

01:05:46.030 --> 01:05:51.830
So just ask for God to forgive you, that’s
all.

01:05:51.830 --> 01:05:58.109
You put your right hand on your heart and
ask for forgiveness.

01:05:58.109 --> 01:05:59.390
It will be better.

01:05:59.390 --> 01:06:05.930
Left hand towards me and right hand on the
heart.

01:06:05.930 --> 01:06:11.720
Now, [while] asking this, you must know that
He is the ocean of compassion.

01:06:11.720 --> 01:06:19.259
He is the ocean of forgiveness and He is the
ocean of love and He is anxious for you to

01:06:19.259 --> 01:06:22.220
enter into His Kingdom.

01:06:22.220 --> 01:06:30.430
He is the One who wants the culmination of
His Creation into a beautiful happening by

01:06:30.430 --> 01:06:33.980
which He gives you the complete joy of your
being.

01:06:33.980 --> 01:06:44.420
So you just ask for His forgiveness but do
not feel guilty about anything.

01:06:44.420 --> 01:06:49.640
Whatever has happened, has happened, is forgiven.

01:06:49.640 --> 01:06:57.839
So you just say that, “If there is anything,
please forgive."

01:06:57.839 --> 01:07:01.569
But do not feel guilty.

01:07:01.569 --> 01:07:09.019
I think best thing is to say, “I’m not
guilty."

01:07:09.019 --> 01:07:15.829
Again and again to say that, “I am not guilty."

01:07:15.829 --> 01:07:22.460
Because that’s a very common practice here,
to feel guilty.

01:07:22.460 --> 01:07:23.460
Let Him judge you.

01:07:23.460 --> 01:07:24.460
Not to feel guilty at all is very important.

01:07:24.460 --> 01:07:25.460
Please tell yourself thrice that, “I am
not guilty."

01:07:25.460 --> 01:07:26.890
Now the Kundalini will rise and you will feel
absolutely thoughtless.

01:07:26.890 --> 01:07:28.329
There’s no thought in your mind.

01:07:28.329 --> 01:07:29.329
You’ll see that.

01:07:29.329 --> 01:07:31.830
Just see it: is there any thought in your
mind.
