00:00:56.754 --> 00:01:04.428
(…) Shri Hanumana is a great character
in our being,

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:11.516
and He runs all the way from Swadhishthana
to your brain

00:01:13.002 --> 00:01:18.413
and He supplies all the necessary guidance
we need

00:01:18.614 --> 00:01:27.844
in our futuristic planning or in our
mental activities.

00:01:28.045 --> 00:01:34.447
He gives us guidance and protection.

00:01:34.739 --> 00:01:39.941
(…) It is very surprising how a deity
like Shri Hanumana,

00:01:40.142 --> 00:01:47.355
who is an eternal child, because He
was like a monkey.

00:01:47.556 --> 00:01:51.952
His head was that of a monkey, if not
of an elephant.

00:01:52.153 --> 00:01:58.822
So He was an eternal child, and He was
the one who was used

00:01:59.023 --> 00:02:03.459
to run the right side of human beings.

00:02:05.701 --> 00:02:08.673
He was told that, “You must control
the sun”,

00:02:08.874 --> 00:02:11.398
to begin with He has to control the sun,

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:15.886
that the sun in the people, if there is
too much sun

00:02:16.087 --> 00:02:24.646
then He must try to control it and make it
cooler or smoother.

00:02:24.847 --> 00:02:30.454
So, He was a child after all, so as soon
He was born,

00:02:30.655 --> 00:02:35.519
when He knew that He has to look after
the sun He said, “Why not eat it off?”

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:43.554
So He ran up the Virata’s body and
ate up the Surya.

00:02:43.755 --> 00:02:45.184
There He had to be told, “No, no, no, no.

00:02:45.385 --> 00:02:49.117
You have to control Him, You don’t have
to put Him inside your stomach”,

00:02:49.318 --> 00:02:54.856
because He thought that this sun will be
controlled better

00:02:55.057 --> 00:02:57.823
if He has it in His own stomach.

00:02:58.024 --> 00:03:06.531
So the beauty of His character is that
He is a child,

00:03:06.732 --> 00:03:10.734
and the child-like behavior of Shri
Hanumana

00:03:10.935 --> 00:03:15.302
has to control the right side.

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:25.061
(…) By the time He grew up He got nine
siddhis, navadha siddhis.

00:03:25.262 --> 00:03:28.391
Nine siddhis He got.

00:03:28.592 --> 00:03:34.658
These siddhis are like this that He could
become big,

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:39.448
He could become so heavy that nobody
could lift Him,

00:03:39.649 --> 00:03:42.740
He could become so sukshmana that nobody
could see Him,

00:03:42.941 --> 00:03:45.988
He could become so subtle that nobody
could see Him.

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:50.816
There are nine siddhis that He got.

00:03:51.017 --> 00:03:57.866
So, a person who has got the right side
too much in him,

00:03:58.067 --> 00:04:03.421
He controls him with these nine siddhis.

00:04:05.298 --> 00:04:12.935
Now, how will He control a man who is
running very fast in his life?

00:04:13.136 --> 00:04:17.260
What He does is to control his movement,

00:04:17.461 --> 00:04:24.291
He makes him in such a way that he has
to put down his speed.

00:04:24.492 --> 00:04:30.225
He makes his feet very heavy, now he
can’t do that much.

00:04:30.426 --> 00:04:33.865
Or He makes his hands very heavy

00:04:34.066 --> 00:04:37.908
so the person cannot work very much
with his hands.

00:04:38.109 --> 00:04:48.866
So He can give a tremendous kind
of a lethargic heaviness

00:04:49.067 --> 00:04:56.064
to a person who is a very right-sided
person.

00:04:57.918 --> 00:05:01.371
He has got another siddhis, which are
very interesting

00:05:01.572 --> 00:05:08.017
is that He can extend His –

00:05:08.218 --> 00:05:12.834
He doesn’t have many weapons, He has
only one gada in His hand

00:05:13.035 --> 00:05:20.438
and He can extend His tail to any extent

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:26.344
and He can handle people with His tail,
He does not have to use His hand.

00:05:26.545 --> 00:05:30.829
Sitting down here, He can put the tail
around anywhere.

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:37.305
If He wants, He can just make a mountain
of His tail and sit on that.

00:05:37.506 --> 00:05:41.904
Like He has all these monkey-tricks as you
do call them, you see,

00:05:42.105 --> 00:05:45.864
and all these things He has within Himself

00:05:46.065 --> 00:05:52.932
is to control a person who is extremely
right-sided, to begin with.

00:05:53.133 --> 00:05:55.896
Then He can fly in the air.

00:05:56.097 --> 00:06:05.119
Just… He doesn’t have any wings, but
He can just fly in the air.

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:09.608
That means He can become so big

00:06:09.809 --> 00:06:17.760
that the amount of air He displaces has
much more weight than His own weight -

00:06:17.961 --> 00:06:22.011
just the same principle Archimedes, if you
know the Archimedes principle -

00:06:22.212 --> 00:06:28.253
that He becomes so big that His body
starts floating in the air.

00:06:28.454 --> 00:06:34.182
Like a boat, you see, you can call it.
And He can fly in the air,

00:06:34.383 --> 00:06:42.700
and by flying in the air He can carry
the message

00:06:42.901 --> 00:06:46.767
from one to another through the ether.

00:06:46.968 --> 00:06:57.574
Now, the subtle of the ether that we have
is under the command of Shri Hanumana.

00:06:57.775 --> 00:07:04.277
He is the one who controls, or is the Lord
of this ether, the subtle of the ether.

00:07:04.478 --> 00:07:09.011
Or say, the causal of the ether. And
through it, it communicates.

00:07:09.212 --> 00:07:12.144
All the communications that you find like

00:07:12.345 --> 00:07:16.353
we have within ourselves also - ductless
glands,

00:07:16.554 --> 00:07:19.678
which our pituitary is using ductless
glands

00:07:19.879 --> 00:07:23.878
is through Hanumana’s movement,

00:07:24.079 --> 00:07:29.354
because He can go into a nirakar, He can
go into a formless state.

00:07:29.567 --> 00:07:33.673
Also the communications, we know for
this communication that we have,

00:07:33.874 --> 00:07:38.886
maybe we can say that there is a…
we have got a loudspeaker,

00:07:39.087 --> 00:07:44.598
but we have a television, we have got
radios and all those things.

00:07:44.799 --> 00:07:52.622
Where we catch on to the ether, anything,
is all the blessings of Hanumana

00:07:52.843 --> 00:07:56.647
and are available to people who are
right-sided.

00:07:56.848 --> 00:08:03.418
Only the right-sided people discover these
things of the space

00:08:03.619 --> 00:08:09.482
which we call as a cordless telephone
or a thing without...

00:08:09.683 --> 00:08:17.332
we have also telegraphs where we don’t
use any wires.

00:08:17.533 --> 00:08:21.441
So without any connection through the ether
He can manage.

00:08:21.642 --> 00:08:28.199
So all the ethereal connections has been
done

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:31.707
by this great engineer, Shri Hanumana.

00:08:31.908 --> 00:08:35.479
And it is so perfect, it’s so perfect

00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:39.677
that you cannot challenge it and you cannot
find faults with it.

00:08:39.878 --> 00:08:42.344
Maybe your instruments may not be
all right,

00:08:42.545 --> 00:08:47.843
but as far as His ethereal work is
concerned, He’s perfectly there.

00:08:48.044 --> 00:08:52.162
Now the scientists discover it and think
that it is in the nature.

00:08:52.363 --> 00:08:56.972
But they never think, “How can it be?”

00:08:57.173 --> 00:09:02.270
We say something in the ether and how
is it, it is received on the other end?

00:09:02.471 --> 00:09:06.388
They just take it for granted, that it is
so that we say something here

00:09:06.589 --> 00:09:13.003
or we relay something on the television,
and it is seen the other side.

00:09:13.204 --> 00:09:19.774
But they never even think or search out
how it is done, what is the way,

00:09:19.975 --> 00:09:25.155
and this is what is the work of Shri
Hanumana,

00:09:25.356 --> 00:09:32.528
who has done such a beautiful network

00:09:32.729 --> 00:09:36.927
and through that network all these things
work out.

00:09:37.128 --> 00:09:48.858
So, even on the right side the vibrations
we get in the molecules,

00:09:49.059 --> 00:09:52.286
as you know that we get molecules
like sulfur dioxide.

00:09:52.487 --> 00:09:54.769
If you have the sulfur has two oxygen

00:09:54.970 --> 00:09:59.472
and the oxygen goes on pulsating like that.

00:09:59.673 --> 00:10:01.959
They are asymmetric, symmetric type
of vibrations,

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:05.068
you all must be knowing about it.
So, all these things,

00:10:05.269 --> 00:10:08.838
symmetric and asymmetric vibrations
are created by whom?

00:10:09.039 --> 00:10:11.363
Nobody wants to know. Nobody wants
to find out,

00:10:11.564 --> 00:10:13.996
because after all in an atom or a -
imagine,

00:10:14.197 --> 00:10:18.572
in a molecule that deep, who does that job?

00:10:18.773 --> 00:10:22.836
Is done by Shri Hanumana in His subtle
ways.

00:10:23.037 --> 00:10:33.035
So, He has another great siddhi, which
we call as anima.

00:10:33.236 --> 00:10:36.968
Anima, anu, anu means a molecule,

00:10:37.169 --> 00:10:43.990
and that means it can enter into a molecule
or renu is the atom -

00:10:44.191 --> 00:10:48.568
it can enter into molecule or into atom.
Now, many scientists think that

00:10:48.769 --> 00:10:51.172
in the modern times they discovered
the molecules.

00:10:51.373 --> 00:10:56.453
It’s not so, because it’s already in our
oldest scriptures description

00:10:56.654 --> 00:11:03.371
of anima is there, is of anu, renu is
there. So, is already described there.

00:11:04.102 --> 00:11:08.933
(…) He is an angel as you know, according
to Christian, we should say,

00:11:09.134 --> 00:11:14.866
according to Bible, that He is the angel
called Gabriel.

00:11:16.052 --> 00:11:22.651
Now, Gabriel is the one who brought the
message, because He’s always a messenger.

00:11:22.852 --> 00:11:27.520
(…) So Maria has to do quite a lot with
Hanumana all Her life.

00:11:27.721 --> 00:11:32.982
That means Maria is the Mahalakshmi.
Mahalakshmi being the Sita,

00:11:33.183 --> 00:11:38.521
Sita, then Radha, Hanumana has to be
there to serve Her.

00:11:39.247 --> 00:11:43.858
(…) Many things which you call miracles
are done by Shri Hanumana.

00:11:44.059 --> 00:11:47.632
He is the one who is the doer of miracles.

00:11:47.833 --> 00:11:55.968
He does miracles also to show how stupid
you are, how foolish you are,

00:11:56.196 --> 00:12:01.326
because He is on the right side, see
He goes to the ego-side.

00:12:01.527 --> 00:12:05.084
Now, with the ego a human being is always,

00:12:05.285 --> 00:12:08.316
becomes stupid and that’s, I mean,
inevitable.

00:12:08.517 --> 00:12:12.027
With ego they become so stupid, “Oh,
what’s wrong?”

00:12:12.228 --> 00:12:15.453
And that’s why you will find many people
doing such stupid things

00:12:15.654 --> 00:12:19.487
we can’t understand why they do it.
They say, “What’s wrong?”

00:12:19.688 --> 00:12:23.890
What’s wrong is that Hanumana doesn’t
like it, is the point,

00:12:24.091 --> 00:12:27.551
and then it recoils.

00:12:27.752 --> 00:12:31.373
When they act stupidly it recoils and
then they know

00:12:31.574 --> 00:12:36.355
that we have done such a big mistake,
or it was all stupid.

00:12:36.556 --> 00:12:41.654
(…) So, He is the one who goes like
a torrential rain

00:12:41.855 --> 00:12:48.781
or can go like a speedy, very speedy
tempest and destroy things.

00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:53.198
So He works out all these things through
His electromagnetic forces.

00:12:53.399 --> 00:13:00.928
So all the matter, all the matter is under
His control,

00:13:01.129 --> 00:13:03.422
all the matter is under His control.

00:13:03.623 --> 00:13:06.888
And He is the one who creates rain for you,

00:13:07.089 --> 00:13:11.014
who creates sun for you, He creates breeze
for you.

00:13:11.215 --> 00:13:13.724
Everything He works out so beautifully

00:13:13.925 --> 00:13:17.586
and nobody even knows that it is Shri
Hanumana who has done it,

00:13:17.787 --> 00:13:21.162
and we should thank Shri Hanumana
all the time.

00:13:21.553 --> 00:13:24.123
(…) So may God bless you.
