00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:06.954
I could not accommodate all of you in my house then I thought better to come here all of you would fit here!

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:11.449
And today is the last day for our Sahaj Yogis (before India Tour).

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:26.675
We have to understand certain very, very important
things about ourselves and our organisation that is Divine.

00:00:31.448 --> 00:00:42.390
Now, in broad lines, I can tell you, not individual
problems and individual things because you are no more individuals now.

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:50.013
You have become part and parcel of the divine Being and you are awakened cells.

00:00:50.013 --> 00:00:59.310
And so, in a broad way we must understand what we have to do about it.

00:01:02.553 --> 00:01:12.512
First thing, we have to kno that we are Realised souls,

00:01:12.512 --> 00:01:27.705
and that you have got Realisation and that you are saints; that you have all the powers that a saint could have.

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:35.510
No saint ever had more powers than you have, as it is, which is manifesting.

00:01:35.629 --> 00:01:41.159
No saint had any knowledge that you have today.

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:49.949
You’ll be amazed, none of the books which have been written so far have been able to

00:01:49.949 --> 00:01:58.500
tell you about the spiritual being that is
within you as you have come to know through

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.860
Sahaja Yoga.

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.250
One has to accept it.

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.279
It is so.

00:02:05.279 --> 00:02:14.570
Any one of them, whosoever has written any
books – even, I would say, Adi Shankaracharya,

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:18.410
he could not explain so many things which
you know.

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:28.440
But the quality of Adi Shankaracharya is very
great, or people of his type – Markandeya

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.670
or Buddha.

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:37.010
The quality is very high because they are
extremely pure people – purity.

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:43.950
They have achieved individual salvation of
a very high degree.

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:49.720
While you have achieved your collective salvation
better.

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.860
But individually they are of a very, very
high quality.

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:59.950
I mean, they had no doubts about Divine Power,
they had no doubts about God.

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:05.390
They never had any doubts and they were very
dignified.

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.500
And they never bothered as to their petty
problems of life.

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.970
For them this was too petty to think about.

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:19.000
Anything which is so petty, we spent so much
time over it.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:28.940
I know we had to do it because, after all,
we are human beings and are coming into Sahaja

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:39.500
Yoga with our human awareness and then we
got our Realisation.

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.000
So the purification time is very, very short.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.850
And while they had such a lot of time to purify
themselves.

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:55.360
Now, for example, Moses was an incarnation,
a very pure form of a personality or, you

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:00.800
can say, Jesus was an incarnation, absolutely
purest form of incarnation.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:12.570
But they are there to be our ideals while
what we have done is to become, from human

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:15.980
beings, a prophet.

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:22.589
So you understand both the things very well,
what the weaknesses human beings have, what

00:04:22.589 --> 00:04:31.360
are their problems, how they get away from
reality, how they are deluded.

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:36.360
But still we do not use our vibratory power
as we should use.

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:43.640
And this is the point I want to tell you – that
you all have vibratory powers.

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:52.760
When we start using our vibratory powers also
we do not know what dignity, protocol we should

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.390
have for using this power.

00:04:54.390 --> 00:05:06.089
It is the power of the Deities within us and it’s a ritual by which we get their power

00:05:06.089 --> 00:05:08.079
working in us.

00:05:08.079 --> 00:05:18.263
As you know that people of ancient times did lot of miracles through this power but they

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.853
were very dignified people.

00:05:21.993 --> 00:05:31.836
There was no frivolousness in their character
and not useless problems within them, absolutely

00:05:31.843 --> 00:05:33.566
of no spiritual value.

00:05:33.606 --> 00:05:39.347
When you use your vibratory awareness you
should not use them for useless powers like,

00:05:39.347 --> 00:05:44.916
for example, going to a cinema and there’s
a traffic and you think that there’s a traffic

00:05:44.916 --> 00:05:47.979
so you must use your vibratory powers to reach
that place.

00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:50.809
Because it’s frivolous; it does not matter.

00:05:50.856 --> 00:05:56.546
In Sahaja Yoga it does not matter whether you go to a cinema or not.

00:05:56.546 --> 00:06:01.356
What matters is: what are your spiritual powers, how far you have come in your spirituality.

00:06:01.356 --> 00:06:04.826
It (the cinema) does not matter at all.

00:06:04.826 --> 00:06:11.395
You are a saint, and what saintliness you are achieving within you is the main problem.

00:06:11.395 --> 00:06:17.246
Otherwise, all the rest of the things that
you have, has no meaning.

00:06:17.246 --> 00:06:21.025
Or all these problems have no meaning in spirituality.

00:06:21.025 --> 00:06:29.675
So, all the Sahaja Yogis must realise that you are now newly born and you are people

00:06:29.675 --> 00:06:33.136
of new awareness and you have to have that
dignity.

00:06:33.136 --> 00:06:37.176
I’ll just give an example because I was
discussing with someone today,

00:06:37.176 --> 00:06:43.259
that when you give somebody a sort of a bandhan, you just turn your hand like this or like that.

00:06:43.259 --> 00:06:44.720
This is not the way it should be done.

00:06:45.076 --> 00:06:48.925
Your hands itself are to be respected because these are the hands of a saint.

00:06:48.925 --> 00:06:54.715
And all the deities reside on your hands and
fingers so when you have to give them bandhan

00:06:54.715 --> 00:06:57.285
or anything, you have to use them properly.

00:06:57.285 --> 00:07:03.845
Use them in such a way that it’s dignified
to do it.

00:07:03.845 --> 00:07:11.416
Any indignity or cheap behaviour should be
absolutely avoided.

00:07:11.416 --> 00:07:19.745
Then dealing with each other you have to know
that you are all now in the circulation of

00:07:19.745 --> 00:07:20.745
Divine Power.

00:07:20.745 --> 00:07:24.035
You have to respect each other and really
love each other.

00:07:24.046 --> 00:07:27.295
You must respect because you are all saints.

00:07:27.355 --> 00:07:30.065
Every saint must respect another saint.

00:07:30.128 --> 00:07:31.937
That’s the minimum of minimum.

00:07:31.937 --> 00:07:38.668
And if you do not respect each other, your
chakras will go out of order, especially Vishuddhi

00:07:38.668 --> 00:07:40.358
because it’s the collective thing.

00:07:40.358 --> 00:07:46.587
And also Mother’s Chakra will go out because
your sense of security is your collectivity.

00:07:46.587 --> 00:07:58.777
And the love between each other has to be
not only looked after but is to be nourished

00:07:58.777 --> 00:08:03.508
and to be worshipped and it should be a virtue.

00:08:03.508 --> 00:08:08.937
You should not treat each other as human beings
treat each other.

00:08:08.937 --> 00:08:09.937
No!

00:08:09.937 --> 00:08:11.848
It’s a precious thing.

00:08:11.848 --> 00:08:17.887
And even while talking to anyone very close
– say your brother, sister, husband, wife

00:08:17.887 --> 00:08:22.628
– you must respect, you must respect, otherwise,
it has no meaning.

00:08:22.628 --> 00:08:27.767
You must respect your parents much more than
you ever respected because they are Sahaja

00:08:27.767 --> 00:08:31.488
Yogis, because they are saints and they are
your parents.

00:08:31.488 --> 00:08:36.978
Respect is the keynote of relationship with
each other to begin with.

00:08:36.978 --> 00:08:39.758
And respect without love has no meaning.

00:08:39.758 --> 00:08:43.178
Respect and love for each other.

00:08:43.178 --> 00:08:49.178
Whether somebody is highly placed in life,
somebody is lowly placed in life, in Sahaja

00:08:49.178 --> 00:08:51.148
Yoga it does not matter.

00:08:51.148 --> 00:08:58.368
How much you earn, what is your position in
life, where you live is not important.

00:08:58.368 --> 00:09:02.688
The main important thing is that we are one
and we are the people who have become now

00:09:02.688 --> 00:09:09.118
prophets and we are the ones who have got
the powers to raise the Kundalini of others

00:09:09.118 --> 00:09:15.078
and such a power has come into us because
our Mother loves us very much and it is our

00:09:15.078 --> 00:09:17.238
duty that we should love each other.

00:09:17.238 --> 00:09:23.048
And how I respect you?

00:09:23.048 --> 00:09:27.748
I need not because you know that there’s
a big gap between you and me.

00:09:27.748 --> 00:09:31.028
But I respect you because you are saints.

00:09:31.028 --> 00:09:37.448
And where the saints are not respected that country goes to dogs.

00:09:37.448 --> 00:09:41.938
So first of all you must learn how to respect
each other.

00:09:41.938 --> 00:09:46.448
And that is a very, very important training
we should have.

00:09:46.448 --> 00:09:54.488
Whether he’s your husband or wife, whether
he’s your brother or sister, father, mother

00:09:54.488 --> 00:09:58.518
or child, because he’s a saint – respect!

00:09:58.518 --> 00:10:03.808
But I do not know how you will react to this
one that immediately you start thinking about

00:10:03.808 --> 00:10:06.108
people who do not respect you.

00:10:06.108 --> 00:10:09.978
Think how many people you do not respect.

00:10:09.978 --> 00:10:16.108
It’s a typical ego-oriented reaction that
immediately we start thinking, “Oh, that

00:10:16.108 --> 00:10:17.438
man does not respect me!

00:10:17.438 --> 00:10:18.438
That man does not respect!”

00:10:18.438 --> 00:10:23.158
But just think how many people you have not respected yourself.

00:10:23.158 --> 00:10:33.758
When I am not here, I am here much more.

00:10:33.758 --> 00:10:39.768
I have not been to Australia, and you know how tremendously these people have come up

00:10:39.768 --> 00:10:43.268
– so pure and so good and so fantastic.

00:10:43.308 --> 00:10:47.938
But that has not happened so much here because
I had to work, really labour here.

00:10:48.358 --> 00:10:50.868
Not that England is that bad.

00:10:51.001 --> 00:10:55.421
But all the time to feel that, “Mother is
around.

00:10:55.439 --> 00:10:58.558
We’ll put all our problems to Her and She
can solve them.

00:10:58.558 --> 00:11:03.589
” Even small, small problems you bring to
me – it’s all right – but now you are

00:11:03.589 --> 00:11:08.453
capable of solving your problems as well as
solving the problems of others.

00:11:08.496 --> 00:11:13.596
Unless it is something fundamental you need
not bother about me and you need not also

00:11:13.596 --> 00:11:14.596
ask me about it.

00:11:14.596 --> 00:11:15.966
You can go ahead with it.

00:11:15.966 --> 00:11:24.626
But you must think everything in the terms
of Sahaja Yoga by which – how much, by that,

00:11:24.626 --> 00:11:26.946
you are doing for Sahaja Yoga?

00:11:26.946 --> 00:11:28.756
How much you are working out for Sahaja Yoga?

00:11:28.756 --> 00:11:31.556
This was the meeting of the Sahaja Yogis today.

00:11:31.556 --> 00:11:38.206
And fundamentally we have to understand one
thing: that we have to grow and we have to

00:11:38.206 --> 00:11:42.636
let others grow with our growth.

00:11:42.636 --> 00:11:45.616
Not by curbing our growth, but with our growth.

00:11:45.616 --> 00:11:48.496
You’ll only grow if you make others grow
with you.

00:11:48.496 --> 00:11:51.326
Otherwise, there will be no growth.

00:11:51.326 --> 00:11:59.616
Now, whatever I say goes into the books, sometimes
into the brains of the people.

00:11:59.616 --> 00:12:04.216
It has to go into the heart.

00:12:04.216 --> 00:12:09.186
The whole Sahaja Yoga system works on the
heart; that is the Spirit.

00:12:09.186 --> 00:12:12.676
Spirit is the thing I’m talking about.

00:12:12.676 --> 00:12:17.446
It’s the Spirit [that] is happy by that.

00:12:17.446 --> 00:12:23.496
Some people, I am told, are using their hands
like a weapon and all that.

00:12:23.496 --> 00:12:25.466
This is very dangerous!

00:12:25.466 --> 00:12:30.406
You are not supposed to do all this for yourself.

00:12:30.406 --> 00:12:32.996
You are still saints, you are not yet gods!

00:12:32.996 --> 00:12:35.616
So don’t try such things.

00:12:35.616 --> 00:12:40.406
Some people have a habit of also hitting a
person with the hand like that.

00:12:40.406 --> 00:12:41.756
In my presence, if I say, it’s all right.

00:12:41.756 --> 00:12:46.136
But otherwise you should not.

00:12:46.136 --> 00:12:47.366
You have to respect.

00:12:47.366 --> 00:12:57.076
Use all tender and gentle methods, never anything
by which you show any disrespect to a saint.

00:12:57.076 --> 00:13:03.466
Of course, you are hitting the negativity
in another person, I know that.

00:13:03.466 --> 00:13:09.676
But you have no business to do that or to
discard anyone or to put somebody out of this

00:13:09.676 --> 00:13:10.676
thing.

00:13:10.676 --> 00:13:13.406
You will go down very much.

00:13:13.406 --> 00:13:19.806
This is a serious thing one must understand.

00:13:19.806 --> 00:13:22.226
You have all the powers you know how far to
go.

00:13:22.226 --> 00:13:23.996
You must keep to your maryadas.

00:13:23.996 --> 00:13:29.606
Don’t go beyond, because these things give
you ego, and ego is the most dangerous thing

00:13:29.606 --> 00:13:32.076
which we face always.

00:13:32.076 --> 00:13:35.256
Try to improve your language.

00:13:35.256 --> 00:13:36.816
Be gentle.

00:13:36.816 --> 00:13:41.526
Be very gentle with each other.

00:13:41.526 --> 00:13:46.336
I expect that you’ll have many more people
by the time I come.

00:13:46.336 --> 00:13:48.926
I expect fantastic things from you.

00:13:48.926 --> 00:13:53.856
I don’t know if I should but I have given
you something so fantastic, so tremendous.

00:13:53.856 --> 00:13:57.376
It is unbelievable.

00:13:57.376 --> 00:14:05.546
I expect it from you, no doubt, because you
are specially selected and I have worked with

00:14:05.546 --> 00:14:07.096
you for years together.

00:14:07.096 --> 00:14:10.406
You have got the tapes in English.

00:14:10.406 --> 00:14:15.486
French people, poor things, they don’t have
tapes in French and they have to be translated.

00:14:15.486 --> 00:14:20.816
They haven’t got a book in French and they
have big problems of understanding me.

00:14:20.816 --> 00:14:27.046
But how dedicated they were, how deep they
are.

00:14:27.046 --> 00:14:32.966
Each one of them came and said, “Mother,
I love You very much.

00:14:32.966 --> 00:14:33.966
I love You.

00:14:33.956 --> 00:14:37.536
“I have many defects and I offer myself
to You.”

00:14:37.546 --> 00:14:40.586
Will you accept me?”

00:14:40.586 --> 00:14:43.286
All of them said this way.

00:14:43.286 --> 00:14:44.286
Just imagine!

00:14:44.286 --> 00:14:50.016
I mean, I was surprised how they were saying
all these things to me and the way they were

00:14:50.016 --> 00:14:52.386
understanding their defects within themselves.

00:14:52.386 --> 00:15:01.976
Now, we have to change our mode of behaviour
towards financial, material, emotional, physical

00:15:01.976 --> 00:15:05.666
and all these things.

00:15:05.666 --> 00:15:13.116
For example, say, one is married – marriages
should be successful.

00:15:13.116 --> 00:15:19.136
If your marriage is not successful and happy,
you are not going to be blessed, not at all.

00:15:19.136 --> 00:15:21.866
Try to make your marriage very happy and successful.

00:15:21.866 --> 00:15:23.996
That’s very important.

00:15:23.996 --> 00:15:27.836
Marriage is the institution established by
Adi Shakti.

00:15:27.836 --> 00:15:30.236
You cannot dishonour it.

00:15:30.236 --> 00:15:33.306
Do not play frivolously with your marriages.

00:15:33.306 --> 00:15:42.256
Then you must also allow the children to be
born to you so that you get great souls coming

00:15:42.256 --> 00:15:51.406
down on this earth by which we are giving
them a chance, a very good chance, to lead

00:15:51.406 --> 00:15:52.616
a very happy life.

00:15:52.616 --> 00:15:57.386
But if husbands, wives are not happy, and
even if Realised-souls are born, they have

00:15:57.386 --> 00:16:02.436
a trouble with you and they do not prosper
well and they have problems.

00:16:02.436 --> 00:16:08.416
So, first of all, create a family of happiness
and joy.

00:16:08.416 --> 00:16:13.476
Some people think if they get away from Sahaja
Yogis, they’ll make a good, happy married

00:16:13.476 --> 00:16:14.476
life.

00:16:14.476 --> 00:16:16.296
It’s absolutely wrong!

00:16:16.296 --> 00:16:18.756
Absolutely wrong!

00:16:18.756 --> 00:16:24.215
If you cannot make a happy married life in
the ashram, you cannot make it anywhere else.

00:16:24.215 --> 00:16:26.266
First try in the ashram.

00:16:26.266 --> 00:16:27.556
[It’s] worth trying.

00:16:27.556 --> 00:16:29.626
Otherwise, you cannot make it.

00:16:29.626 --> 00:16:33.726
Because then you understand how you share
your life with others and your married life.

00:16:33.726 --> 00:16:38.676
Any such thing like any material thing, like
getting a house or getting this thing, that

00:16:38.676 --> 00:16:40.616
thing is not so important.

00:16:40.616 --> 00:16:45.446
Your house should be clean within yourself,
your temple of your heart.

00:16:45.446 --> 00:16:49.396
We are not here to build houses, not to accumulate
money.

00:16:49.396 --> 00:16:52.496
We are here to build our temples within ourselves.

00:16:52.496 --> 00:16:59.331
The real temples which are growing, which are the living temples of living God within us.

00:16:59.396 --> 00:17:05.126
So these material things are important up to a point, not more than that.

00:17:05.126 --> 00:17:12.268
Most important is not how you are substantiated by Sahaja Yoga but how much you have substantiated Sahaja Yoga through.

00:17:12.866 --> 00:17:16.466
Many people think, “We should get a good house because we have come to Mataji.

00:17:16.466 --> 00:17:18.902
Yes, you do get. You get good jobs. All right.

00:17:18.902 --> 00:17:21.342
You get it. You get your financial conditions improved.

00:17:21.342 --> 00:17:22.911
All right. Everything happens to you.

00:17:23.293 --> 00:17:26.763
But how much have you given to Sahaja Yoga?

00:17:26.936 --> 00:17:29.536
In the way: how much have you substantiated?

00:17:29.536 --> 00:17:33.235
People think sometimes that if they donate money that’s sufficient. It’s not.

00:17:33.616 --> 00:17:43.590
To enrich it with your heart, with your lovingness, with your friendship, with your sweet understanding of each other,

00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:48.386
enjoyment of each other’s company in the purest form, not with any purpose

00:17:48.386 --> 00:17:58.056
or with any intention of getting any low type of joy or low type of happiness from someone

00:17:58.056 --> 00:17:59.506
ego-oriented or sex-oriented.

00:17:59.506 --> 00:18:04.056
But it’s pure joy, pure joy.

00:18:04.056 --> 00:18:06.626
Purity is the theme we have to take to.

00:18:06.626 --> 00:18:10.696
We have to try to be purer and purer.

00:18:10.696 --> 00:18:20.134
And the purity will be shown brilliantly on your faces, in your behaviour, in the whole being as you would be.

00:18:20.134 --> 00:18:24.904
Your presence itself will show that you are Sahaja Yogis.

00:18:25.186 --> 00:18:26.386
You won’t have to certify.

00:18:26.386 --> 00:18:31.926
You won’t have to wear some special dresses to say, but people will know from your faces

00:18:31.926 --> 00:18:34.866
that you are saints, from your behaviour.

00:18:34.866 --> 00:18:39.116
You have to stand back in the last queue.

00:18:39.116 --> 00:18:41.366
You should be the people who should look at things.

00:18:41.366 --> 00:18:48.036
You should not be the first, unique, to get into the thing first, to getting into the queue first.

00:18:48.036 --> 00:18:52.229
No, you are the last because you are with yourself. They are not.

00:18:52.726 --> 00:18:54.616
They have not [got] their own securities.

00:18:54.616 --> 00:18:57.296
They are trying to find securities in these things.

00:18:57.296 --> 00:19:00.136
You have your own securities.

00:19:00.136 --> 00:19:09.506
Change, according to the Spirit, all your priorities, and then joy is your own.

00:19:09.506 --> 00:19:16.206
I really expect fantastic things from you and I hope you all will join together and

00:19:16.206 --> 00:19:21.346
work it out and create something fantastic.

00:19:21.346 --> 00:19:26.476
I don’t know how to tell individually about things but as it is I have already spoken

00:19:26.476 --> 00:19:31.995
to these Sahaja Yogis in Paris and I have told them that Sahaja Yoga is a very speedy

00:19:31.995 --> 00:19:32.995
thing.

00:19:32.995 --> 00:19:33.995
And it’s very speedy.

00:19:33.995 --> 00:19:39.589
It’s such a speed and if you do not keep with the speed of Sahaja Yoga you’ll be

00:19:39.696 --> 00:19:40.696
thrown out.

00:19:40.739 --> 00:19:43.539
You have to keep to the speed of Sahaja Yoga.

00:19:43.539 --> 00:19:48.009
Those who cannot keep by some method or other,
or [who] get locked up by something or some

00:19:48.009 --> 00:19:50.359
misidentification, will drop out.

00:19:50.359 --> 00:19:55.459
You’ll only grow when you will keep to the speed of Sahaja Yoga.

00:19:55.459 --> 00:19:57.779
It is going to be tremendous in India.

00:19:57.779 --> 00:20:01.159
I know these five years are going to be tremendous
in Australia.

00:20:01.159 --> 00:20:05.609
England may be, depending on your people putting
up the speed.

00:20:05.609 --> 00:20:10.369
It’s going to be tremendously speedy and
you have to understand that – drop out all

00:20:10.369 --> 00:20:18.419
your shackles and drop out all your misidentifications,
all nonsenses of fanaticism or of misidentifications

00:20:18.419 --> 00:20:21.299
that you are British, this, that, all this.

00:20:21.299 --> 00:20:23.659
And just become Sahaja Yogis and universal
beings.

00:20:23.659 --> 00:20:24.659
It’s very important.

00:20:24.659 --> 00:20:26.599
The time has come now.

00:20:26.599 --> 00:20:28.439
From next year it will start.

00:20:28.439 --> 00:20:30.830
So, I wish you a very Happy New Year

00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:35.660
and a very, very happy and cheerful Christmas. May God bless you.

00:51:26.727 --> 00:51:29.477
Who are the new people today, for the first
time?

00:51:29.477 --> 00:51:30.477
You?

00:51:30.477 --> 00:51:36.667
I am sorry I had to say all these things because
today was the meeting of the Sahaja Yogis

00:51:36.667 --> 00:51:38.116
in the beginning.

00:51:38.116 --> 00:51:44.526
And we are all going to enter into the same
Realm and it will be handy for you to know

00:51:44.526 --> 00:51:54.317
what is expected of Sahaja Yogis, and with
that expectation I request you not to pay

00:51:54.317 --> 00:51:59.797
attention to what I have said, much.

00:51:59.797 --> 00:52:00.907
You should not be frightened.

00:52:00.907 --> 00:52:02.067
It’s not that frightening.

00:52:02.067 --> 00:52:03.987
You’ll like it later on very much!

00:52:03.987 --> 00:52:06.597
What I have said it, you see.

00:52:06.597 --> 00:52:07.787
So come forward.

00:52:07.787 --> 00:52:12.917
Those who have come for the first time, please
come forward.

00:52:12.917 --> 00:52:14.217
You come for the first time?

00:52:14.217 --> 00:52:15.217
All right.

00:52:15.217 --> 00:52:16.217
Come forward!

00:52:16.217 --> 00:52:18.097
Will be better idea.

00:52:18.097 --> 00:52:21.176
No, no, here, on the chair.

00:52:21.176 --> 00:52:23.647
On the first row of chairs.

00:52:23.647 --> 00:52:26.247
Will be a good idea.

00:52:26.247 --> 00:52:27.247
Yes.

00:52:27.247 --> 00:52:29.407
Actually, it happens that your religion gets
enlightened.

00:52:29.407 --> 00:52:30.407
You become that.

00:52:30.407 --> 00:52:32.497
Then you can’t help it.

00:52:32.497 --> 00:52:33.497
What to do?

00:52:33.497 --> 00:52:36.017
I mean you don’t have to tell, “Don’t
do!

00:52:36.017 --> 00:52:37.286
Don’t do!”

00:52:37.286 --> 00:52:39.176
It just happens.

00:52:39.176 --> 00:52:42.337
You just can’t do it.

00:52:42.337 --> 00:52:45.506
It’s so helpful, isn’t it?

00:52:45.506 --> 00:52:48.666
You just can’t do it.

00:52:48.666 --> 00:52:52.456
You don’t feel like doing it!

00:52:52.456 --> 00:52:55.297
Because if you are enjoying your Spirit you
don’t feel like doing nonsensical things.

00:52:55.297 --> 00:52:58.727
It is better to get it and see for yourself
what happens.

00:52:58.727 --> 00:52:59.727
All right?

00:52:59.727 --> 00:53:02.326
That’s the best way to give it a full chance.

00:53:02.326 --> 00:53:05.736
Those who have come for the first time do
come forward.

00:53:05.736 --> 00:53:07.346
You’ve come for the first time?

00:53:07.346 --> 00:53:08.346
Please come forward.

00:53:08.346 --> 00:53:09.346
No!

00:53:09.346 --> 00:53:10.346
You are not for the first time!

00:53:10.346 --> 00:53:11.346
Let her come forward here.

00:53:11.346 --> 00:53:13.477
You are all for the first time here?

00:53:13.477 --> 00:53:14.477
No.

00:53:14.477 --> 00:53:18.127
You can go one step backward, is a good idea.

00:53:18.127 --> 00:53:22.547
You see, you can receive my vibrations even
from there where Kingsley is.

00:53:22.547 --> 00:53:24.587
Isn’t it Kingsley?

00:53:24.587 --> 00:53:27.977
Aren’t you receiving my vibrations?

00:53:27.977 --> 00:53:28.977
Much more!

00:53:28.977 --> 00:53:30.486
Yes that’s it.

00:53:30.486 --> 00:53:36.757
Now this is a system which is built within
us.

00:53:36.757 --> 00:53:41.977
That’s why it is called as ‘Sahaja’.

00:53:41.977 --> 00:53:47.007
This is what is the system within us that
exists.

00:53:47.007 --> 00:53:49.187
‘Sahaja’ means ‘born with you’.

00:53:49.187 --> 00:53:51.797
This is all born with you.

00:53:51.797 --> 00:53:53.107
You have achieved it.

00:53:53.107 --> 00:53:54.717
It’s all within you.

00:53:54.717 --> 00:53:57.227
It’s a system that is built into this or
built into that.

00:53:57.227 --> 00:54:00.797
In the same way it’s a system built into
you.

00:54:00.797 --> 00:54:03.407
You are just ready.

00:54:03.407 --> 00:54:04.587
You are to be put to the mains.

00:54:04.587 --> 00:54:06.377
That’s all is the job is.

00:54:06.377 --> 00:54:09.177
For putting to the mains also there’s something
built into you.

00:54:09.177 --> 00:54:15.077
If you see the triangular bone called as ‘sacrum’,
means ‘sacred bone’, this Kundalini is

00:54:15.077 --> 00:54:16.077
there.

00:54:16.077 --> 00:54:21.227
This is the one that gives you your rebirth.

00:54:21.227 --> 00:54:27.337
By rebirth what happens [is] that your awareness,
which is human awareness, becomes enlightened

00:54:27.337 --> 00:54:29.467
by your Spirit.

00:54:29.467 --> 00:54:30.957
Your Spirit comes into your awareness.

00:54:30.957 --> 00:54:32.137
So far your Spirit is not.

00:54:32.137 --> 00:54:36.347
Your Spirit knows all about you.

00:54:36.347 --> 00:54:39.247
It is in your heart.

00:54:39.247 --> 00:54:44.549
But you do not know about It.

00:54:44.549 --> 00:54:49.707
So what happens [is] this Spirit, which is
enjoying itself, enlightens your awareness

00:54:49.707 --> 00:54:55.587
and you get a new awareness by which you start
feeling a cool breeze in your hand, a cool

00:54:55.587 --> 00:54:57.257
breeze in your hand.

00:54:57.257 --> 00:55:02.377
And this cool breeze, for the first time,
on your central nervous system starts flowing.

00:55:02.377 --> 00:55:06.247
So you feel it, actually you feel it.

00:55:06.247 --> 00:55:10.507
Now the enlightenment takes place of all these
centres which are within you, which are there

00:55:10.507 --> 00:55:11.887
because of our evolutionary process.

00:55:11.887 --> 00:55:20.697
And these enlightened centres are on your
fingers.

00:55:20.697 --> 00:55:25.137
They get enlightened too and you start feeling
them within you.

00:55:25.137 --> 00:55:30.107
You start feeling your own centres and you
start feeling the centres of others.

00:55:30.107 --> 00:55:35.687
Now this happening takes place within you
of the Kundalini awakening just to attract

00:55:35.687 --> 00:55:36.757
your attention inside.

00:55:36.757 --> 00:55:38.687
Because your attention is outside, you cannot
take it in.

00:55:38.687 --> 00:55:42.636
You know many people think, “You put your
attention here, you put your attention there.

00:55:42.636 --> 00:55:43.657
” – it’s all wrong.

00:55:43.657 --> 00:55:48.467
It has to be spontaneously attracted inside
and it’s done by this Kundalini, and Kundalini

00:55:48.467 --> 00:55:53.607
is just like a germinating primule within
us, a seed.

00:55:53.607 --> 00:55:57.967
It just rises spontaneously.

00:55:57.967 --> 00:56:00.567
And when it rises it breaks through here.

00:56:00.567 --> 00:56:02.157
And this is what is the real Baptism.

00:56:02.157 --> 00:56:06.637
You really feel it here coming out.

00:56:06.637 --> 00:56:09.137
You can feel the cool breeze coming out.

00:56:09.137 --> 00:56:13.657
You can feel the cool breeze from your hands.

00:56:13.657 --> 00:56:21.657
This is real Baptism that John the Baptist
wanted people to have, and that Christ talked

00:56:21.657 --> 00:56:22.657
about.

00:56:22.657 --> 00:56:27.397
All the religions have taught us to be in
the centre.

00:56:27.397 --> 00:56:33.107
When they said, “Don’t do this, don’t
do that,” they did not want to condition

00:56:33.107 --> 00:56:41.777
us but to tell us that how we are going to
be in the centre.

00:56:41.777 --> 00:56:56.247
And when we are in the centre then what happens
to us [is] that you get the desire to know

00:56:56.247 --> 00:56:57.997
your Spirit.

00:56:57.997 --> 00:57:04.187
And this desire is fulfilled through the awakening
of the Kundalini.

00:57:04.187 --> 00:57:10.307
Now the Sahaja Yoga at this stage is really
a Maha Yoga in the sense [that] it is the

00:57:10.307 --> 00:57:13.947
Great Yoga because many people can get Realisation.

00:57:13.947 --> 00:57:19.947
Thousands of people can get it because the
blossom time has come.

00:57:19.947 --> 00:57:26.167
But even if they get Realisation, they are
to be looked after, they are to be nourished,

00:57:26.167 --> 00:57:28.397
they are to be told about it.

00:57:28.397 --> 00:57:29.997
Everything should be decoded.

00:57:29.997 --> 00:57:32.697
You will be amazed – everything becomes
so logical.

00:57:32.697 --> 00:57:35.647
Gradually you start understanding it.

00:57:35.647 --> 00:57:39.347
Your complete freedom is established.

00:57:39.347 --> 00:57:41.397
Nobody says that, “Don’t do this!”

00:57:41.397 --> 00:57:42.527
Nothing is said.

00:57:42.527 --> 00:57:47.937
But you just don’t do it – yourself!

00:57:47.937 --> 00:57:50.577
I will not tell you as Moses had to tell,
poor thing.

00:57:50.637 --> 00:57:52.987
He had to face all the mad people.

00:57:53.017 --> 00:57:59.047
But no, after Realisation it just happens
and you just don’t do it.

00:57:59.047 --> 00:58:00.047
You will not do it.

00:58:00.047 --> 00:58:01.047
It just happens to you.

00:58:01.047 --> 00:58:03.597
It is nothing to be told.

00:58:03.597 --> 00:58:04.787
It just happens.

00:58:04.787 --> 00:58:06.277
It works out.

00:58:06.277 --> 00:58:10.607
This is what is Sahaja Yoga.

00:58:10.607 --> 00:58:13.817
In the beginning you have to be really ardent
Sahaja Yogis.

00:58:13.817 --> 00:58:14.817
In the beginning you have to be.

00:58:14.817 --> 00:58:17.947
It’s the beginning of Sahaja Yoga still
in England, I would say.

00:58:17.947 --> 00:58:22.727
Really ardently attached to it by which you
develop yourself very well and develop this

00:58:22.727 --> 00:58:25.717
tree of Sahaja Yoga in your own country.

00:58:25.717 --> 00:58:27.977
Because you have to save so many.

00:58:27.977 --> 00:58:29.836
The Last Judgment has started.

00:58:29.836 --> 00:58:30.836
It’s started.

00:58:30.836 --> 00:58:33.737
Through Kundalini awakening only you judge
yourself.

00:58:33.737 --> 00:58:36.637
You know what are the centres you are catching,
what are your problems.

00:58:36.637 --> 00:58:38.697
You know what are the centres others are catching.

00:58:38.697 --> 00:58:39.697
You judge yourself.

00:58:39.697 --> 00:58:43.737
Supposing a person comes and tell me, “Mother,
my Agnya is very bad.

00:58:43.737 --> 00:58:44.907
” Do you know what it means?

00:58:44.907 --> 00:58:46.576
That, “My ego has developed.

00:58:46.576 --> 00:58:49.937
” But [if] you tell somebody, “You have
got an ego.

00:58:49.937 --> 00:58:52.077
” – you will have a punch on your head!

00:58:52.077 --> 00:58:57.357
But the person himself comes and says, “Mother,
I see my ego.

00:58:57.357 --> 00:58:58.777
” You start seeing yourself.

00:58:58.777 --> 00:59:03.086
You start seeing your problems, because you
are out of it.

00:59:03.086 --> 00:59:06.336
And then you can cure it also and make it
better.

00:59:06.336 --> 00:59:11.257
You improve it and you are better.

00:59:11.257 --> 00:59:14.767
You judge yourself and you judge yourself
with love and understanding.

00:59:14.767 --> 00:59:16.537
You don’t hate yourself by that.

00:59:16.537 --> 00:59:17.537
It’s only you, yourself.

00:59:17.537 --> 00:59:18.537
You are going to judge.

00:59:18.537 --> 00:59:25.627
Within you is the power of God that judges
you, is the Spirit which tells you.

00:59:25.627 --> 00:59:27.979
A rapport is established with the Spirit.

00:59:27.979 --> 00:59:32.247
The Spirit itself will tell you, “This is
the mistake, this is the problem.

00:59:32.247 --> 00:59:33.597
” We don’t need anybody to tell us.

00:59:33.597 --> 00:59:36.227
It’s only you who will know.

00:59:36.227 --> 00:59:39.297
It’s only you who will judge yourself.

00:59:39.297 --> 00:59:41.017
It’s only you who will grow yourself.

00:59:41.017 --> 00:59:42.707
It’s your own freedom.

00:59:42.707 --> 00:59:45.157
It’s your own Self.

00:59:45.157 --> 00:59:49.457
Your entire personality changes, entire personality
changes.

00:59:49.457 --> 00:59:54.777
I have never told anybody not to take drugs
as such, except for one or two people who

00:59:54.777 --> 00:59:56.067
were still carrying on.

00:59:56.067 --> 00:59:57.366
But also very mildly.

00:59:57.366 --> 01:00:00.607
And I told them how to get rid of it.

01:00:00.607 --> 01:00:03.797
But you just don’t want to take them, just
don’t like it.

01:00:03.797 --> 01:00:08.607
You find it very filthy.

01:00:08.607 --> 01:00:10.797
You feel like vomiting.

01:00:10.797 --> 01:00:12.813
Just like that, the religion is enlightened
in your stomach.

01:00:12.813 --> 01:00:15.047
That the time has come now for you to do it.

01:00:15.047 --> 01:00:18.597
That was the time when it was not so [then]
they taught you how to do it.

01:00:18.597 --> 01:00:19.977
But today the time has come, it can work out.

01:00:19.977 --> 01:00:22.876
You are all just there.

01:00:22.876 --> 01:00:27.337
The completion of the whole creation has to
come this way.

01:00:27.337 --> 01:00:29.867
It has to work out.

01:00:29.867 --> 01:00:32.457
But you cannot reason it out.

01:00:32.457 --> 01:00:36.337
But once you get it – because it’s beyond
reason, it happens beyond reason; the Kundalini

01:00:36.337 --> 01:00:41.777
awakens not by reason, spontaneously, by master
only – once it happens then the whole thing

01:00:41.777 --> 01:00:43.877
becomes logical.

01:00:43.877 --> 01:00:46.327
You see, there’s a microscope, then you
can see through it.

01:00:46.327 --> 01:00:48.977
But if there is not a microscope, you cannot
understand.

01:00:48.977 --> 01:00:53.847
The ‘microscope’ is your Spirit.

01:00:53.847 --> 01:00:56.777
It’s very simple.

01:00:56.777 --> 01:01:00.767
Now, I do not want to go into details about
it.

01:01:00.767 --> 01:01:02.467
I think these people have been given…

01:01:02.467 --> 01:01:07.037
Gavin have you given them the papers and things?

01:01:07.037 --> 01:01:12.537
Let them see for themselves.

01:01:12.537 --> 01:01:17.547
Have you all got the papers?

01:01:17.547 --> 01:01:19.107
Have you got?

01:01:19.107 --> 01:01:20.107
No?

01:01:20.107 --> 01:01:21.187
Let her have.

01:01:21.187 --> 01:01:23.267
Let this lady have.

01:01:23.267 --> 01:01:26.327
You sit a little erect, all right?

01:01:26.327 --> 01:01:28.337
Straight, sit little straight.

01:01:28.337 --> 01:01:29.347
All right.

01:01:29.347 --> 01:01:33.267
You have to sit a little erect, not much,
but a little erect.

01:01:33.267 --> 01:01:34.527
Not slouchy.

01:01:34.527 --> 01:01:36.457
Neither like this.

01:01:36.457 --> 01:01:37.907
Just sit straight.

01:01:37.907 --> 01:01:41.637
Put your hands like this, all of you.

01:01:41.637 --> 01:01:44.497
Just put your hands.

01:01:44.497 --> 01:01:47.347
Now close your eyes.

01:01:47.347 --> 01:01:54.497
Put your feet like this, little straight,
on the ground.

01:01:54.497 --> 01:02:06.367
Not pressing much but they should be on the
ground properly.

01:02:06.367 --> 01:02:07.797
Come in!

01:02:07.797 --> 01:02:09.037
Come!

01:02:09.037 --> 01:02:15.267
There are three, four seats.

01:02:15.267 --> 01:02:18.997
Here, in front.

01:02:18.997 --> 01:02:20.247
Yes.

01:02:20.247 --> 01:02:33.196
After Realisation you have to go very fast
and try to understand it, otherwise you may

01:02:33.196 --> 01:02:34.477
lose your vibrations.

01:02:34.477 --> 01:02:35.477
That happens with some people.

01:02:35.477 --> 01:02:36.477
So be careful!

01:02:36.477 --> 01:02:39.527
It’s a very, very delicate thing; it’s
very subtle.

01:02:39.527 --> 01:02:46.256
And because we are gross – suddenly we become
subtle – if we do not catch up to it, we

01:02:46.256 --> 01:02:47.256
lose it also.

01:02:47.256 --> 01:02:53.617
So for one month after Realisation you have
to be very, very careful and get hold of another

01:02:53.617 --> 01:02:55.817
Sahaja Yogis here and we also have an ashram
here.

01:02:55.817 --> 01:02:58.997
We have to work it out.

01:02:58.997 --> 01:03:01.977
Close your eyes.

01:03:01.977 --> 01:03:05.946
Just close your eyes.

01:03:05.946 --> 01:03:08.617
It just works.

01:03:08.617 --> 01:03:09.777
Just close your eyes.

01:03:09.777 --> 01:03:11.327
Don’t think about it.

01:03:11.327 --> 01:03:12.327
Don’t think.

01:03:12.327 --> 01:03:13.440
It will work out without thinking.

01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:15.837
Put both the hands towards me, please.

01:03:15.837 --> 01:03:20.677
Both the hands like this.

01:03:20.677 --> 01:03:25.137
One of the centres that is catching in most
of you is that you all feel guilty for nothing

01:03:25.137 --> 01:03:28.207
at all, for nothing at all.

01:03:28.207 --> 01:03:30.787
It’s a fashion to feel guilty.

01:03:30.787 --> 01:03:34.657
So everybody starts feeling guilty for nothing
at all.

01:03:34.657 --> 01:03:36.557
Or maybe we confess and this and that.

01:03:36.557 --> 01:03:41.907
Now I have to tell you that not to feel guilty
at all.

01:03:41.907 --> 01:03:44.037
Say that, “I am not guilty.

01:03:44.037 --> 01:03:45.037
”

01:03:45.037 --> 01:03:47.006
Thrice you say, “Mother, I am not guilty.

01:03:47.006 --> 01:03:48.006
”

01:03:48.006 --> 01:03:54.497
This is also a myth that you feel guilty.

01:03:54.497 --> 01:04:10.377
That will help you a lot.

01:05:02.053 --> 01:05:07.073
Once you get your Realisation you have to
also have the spiritual education to know

01:05:07.133 --> 01:05:11.083
how to handle this, how to handle this power.

01:05:11.133 --> 01:05:17.403
You are getting it because this is your own
right, but you must know what

01:05:17.463 --> 01:05:18.463
you are getting.

01:07:22.278 --> 01:07:26.218
They’ve got it, all of them.

01:08:25.072 --> 01:08:34.212
All the Sahaja Yogis should receive vibrations
and expose completely with their heart, absolutely.

01:08:34.212 --> 01:08:35.197
Just put it.

01:08:35.252 --> 01:08:38.262
Be meditative today.

01:08:38.262 --> 01:08:40.937
And you have to promise in your heart.

01:08:51.257 --> 01:08:59.983
You have to be much more active and ardent
about Sahaja Yoga if you have to save your

01:09:00.007 --> 01:09:04.276
brothers and sisters.

01:09:17.449 --> 01:09:20.860
Only your heart can be binding, nothing else.

01:09:20.860 --> 01:09:21.860
Nothing else.

01:09:21.860 --> 01:09:23.120
It’s only your heart.

01:09:33.881 --> 01:09:39.471
As you are attached to someone you love, you
should be attached to your Spirit.

01:09:39.531 --> 01:09:41.740
Spirit you should love the most.

01:09:41.740 --> 01:09:45.731
Nobody is more important than your Spirit.

01:09:57.216 --> 01:10:00.076
Are you feeling any cool breeze in the hands?

01:10:00.076 --> 01:10:01.076
Not yet?

01:10:01.076 --> 01:10:02.249
Close your eyes.

01:10:02.276 --> 01:10:04.269
Have patience with yourself.

01:10:04.299 --> 01:10:05.899
One has to have patience.

01:10:08.848 --> 01:10:10.159
Close your eyes.

01:10:11.118 --> 01:10:12.118
Have patience!

01:10:12.118 --> 01:10:13.279
Just don’t think.

01:10:13.268 --> 01:10:14.778
It will work out.

01:10:14.768 --> 01:10:16.718
Have patience with yourself!

01:10:16.758 --> 01:10:21.745
You put both the hands towards me, not meeting
each other but towards me, separate.

01:10:21.745 --> 01:10:26.396
Put both the hands separately, not towards
each other but towards me.

01:10:26.396 --> 01:10:28.446
Please put them towards me.

01:10:32.944 --> 01:10:33.944
Yes.

01:10:34.258 --> 01:10:35.498
Close your eyes.

01:10:35.518 --> 01:10:36.748
Close your eyes.

01:10:36.765 --> 01:10:37.765
And just leave it.

01:10:37.745 --> 01:10:38.825
Don’t think about it.

01:10:38.835 --> 01:10:40.278
Don’t worry about it.

01:10:40.295 --> 01:10:41.158
It will work.

01:10:41.213 --> 01:10:44.813
It’s like just a flower becoming a fruit
– spontaneously.

01:11:24.954 --> 01:11:30.084
Just close your eyes and put your hands towards
me. And don't think, please.

01:15:30.461 --> 01:15:32.710
Put your attention to your heart.

01:15:32.753 --> 01:15:34.683
Catch the joy part of it.

01:15:34.683 --> 01:15:35.683
Just heart.

01:15:35.683 --> 01:15:41.380
Just put your both the hands towards me only
and just pay attention to your heart.

01:15:41.390 --> 01:15:42.940
It will work out.

01:15:42.970 --> 01:15:45.110
Are you feeling cool breeze?

01:15:45.140 --> 01:15:47.860
It’s good, great.

01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:50.830
Just enjoy it.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:52.820
Just enjoy.

01:17:28.961 --> 01:17:32.341
Do not pay attention in one particular direction.

01:17:32.491 --> 01:17:34.261
Just leave it free.

01:17:34.302 --> 01:17:36.771
Just leave it free.

01:17:38.961 --> 01:17:41.422
Do not fix your attention anywhere.

01:17:41.422 --> 01:17:42.714
Just leave it free.

01:17:42.758 --> 01:17:43.758
It will work out.

01:17:57.628 --> 01:18:04.068
Gavin, organise for these people behind.

01:18:04.312 --> 01:18:07.173
Ask people to slowly come along.

01:18:07.173 --> 01:18:09.408
Keep your eyes shut.

01:18:09.492 --> 01:18:12.532
All new people please keep your eyes shut.

01:18:12.532 --> 01:18:16.561
They are going to check you.

01:18:42.640 --> 01:18:45.690
One by one, yes move on.

01:18:46.020 --> 01:18:49.220
Jill, come forward.

01:18:49.270 --> 01:18:54.930
Start moving in the centre.

01:18:54.980 --> 01:18:56.460
Yes.

01:18:56.460 --> 01:18:57.929
Good.

01:19:03.949 --> 01:19:09.985
Those Sahaja Yogis who want to get themselves
also checked up, ask other Sahaja Yogis to

01:19:10.009 --> 01:19:11.055
do it.

01:19:24.488 --> 01:19:31.348
Magda, I think these three people are for
the first time or what?

01:19:31.438 --> 01:19:35.408
Just see them, their vibrations.

01:19:41.140 --> 01:19:45.618
They haven’t felt it yet.

01:19:49.050 --> 01:19:53.950
Can you move a little coming up here.

01:19:53.950 --> 01:19:55.160
Marcus?

01:19:55.160 --> 01:19:59.999
Or who is there?

01:19:59.999 --> 01:20:03.720
Those who want to be checked.

01:20:03.720 --> 01:20:08.890
Also ask others to be checked.

01:20:08.890 --> 01:20:13.200
Douglas, go and check Dinesh.

01:20:13.200 --> 01:20:18.090
All of you must get checking!

01:20:18.090 --> 01:20:20.200
Those of you who want checking should raise
your hands.

01:20:20.200 --> 01:20:24.940
Ask people to check you.

01:20:24.940 --> 01:20:25.999
Check her.

01:20:36.753 --> 01:20:40.133
Vishuddhi, Left Vishuddhis are horrible.

01:20:40.184 --> 01:20:44.563
I don’t know what to say.

01:20:48.013 --> 01:20:52.553
Hester [Spiro], you ask somebody to check
you also.

01:20:52.713 --> 01:20:54.613
Peter [Pearce], you sit down.

01:20:54.610 --> 01:20:56.450
David [Spiro] you sit down!

01:20:56.450 --> 01:20:58.013
Get yourself checked!

01:20:58.077 --> 01:20:59.717
Linda [Pearce], Peter, all of you.

01:20:59.717 --> 01:21:00.717
Please.

01:21:00.717 --> 01:21:01.717
Because I am going away.

01:21:01.717 --> 01:21:04.396
Let everybody be checked – better is.

01:21:04.396 --> 01:21:05.396
Marcus?

01:21:05.396 --> 01:21:08.127
You be checked also.

01:21:08.127 --> 01:21:10.457
Better to get it done once for all.

01:21:10.503 --> 01:21:12.223
Get them checked.

01:21:20.603 --> 01:21:22.903
Who can check her?

01:21:47.335 --> 01:21:49.179
Ray [Harris]?

01:21:49.249 --> 01:21:50.519
Where is he?

01:21:50.559 --> 01:21:52.479
Go and check Hester.

01:21:57.152 --> 01:22:01.892
He’s got it?

01:22:15.763 --> 01:22:18.443
Kingsley you check Hester, it’s better.

01:22:18.473 --> 01:22:21.533
He (Ray) is a Jew (also) so it would be better!

01:22:21.593 --> 01:22:24.493
(laughing) Somebody else should do it it’s
better.

01:22:24.593 --> 01:22:27.773
May God bless you!

01:22:31.930 --> 01:22:36.040
But everybody gets checked it’s better!

01:22:37.903 --> 01:22:39.253
John, you sit down.

01:22:39.283 --> 01:22:41.123
You get yourself checked.

01:22:41.123 --> 01:22:41.853
Sit down.

01:22:41.917 --> 01:22:42.917
Marcus?

01:22:42.917 --> 01:22:44.647
Is he checked?

01:22:47.103 --> 01:22:48.213
How are they?

01:22:48.603 --> 01:22:52.303
Now those who are checking should get themselves
checked also, is a better idea.

01:22:52.393 --> 01:22:55.793
There should be nothing.

01:22:59.973 --> 01:23:04.423
‘Prana’ – say the mantra for him.

01:23:04.513 --> 01:23:09.883
For her, Malcolm [Murdoch], ‘Prana’ is
the mantra for her.

01:23:11.923 --> 01:23:12.923
Haa!

01:23:12.923 --> 01:23:13.923
Done.

01:23:16.723 --> 01:23:18.173
Just broken through.

01:23:18.173 --> 01:23:19.173
Haaa!

01:23:26.563 --> 01:23:29.473
Now this is to be judged a little by yourself.

01:23:29.513 --> 01:23:30.923
You should know.

01:23:30.977 --> 01:23:34.053
These are the small things that one should
know.

01:23:34.171 --> 01:23:36.161
This gentleman?

01:23:36.161 --> 01:23:42.142
Why don’t you see this gentleman?

01:23:42.131 --> 01:23:46.121
Can you check John.

01:23:49.472 --> 01:23:52.972
John, put your left hand towards me and right
hand outside.

01:23:53.015 --> 01:23:54.492
Felicity [Payment].

01:23:54.632 --> 01:24:00.652
Somebody should check Felicity also.

01:24:02.282 --> 01:24:06.232
Brighton people should again get themselves
rechecked afterwards.

01:24:06.232 --> 01:24:09.442
Everybody should get themselves rechecked.

01:24:09.489 --> 01:24:12.399
Somehow or other get yourself cleared out.

01:24:12.399 --> 01:24:14.022
Every one of you.

01:24:14.042 --> 01:24:16.422
Gavin you also get yourself checked.

01:24:16.412 --> 01:24:19.152
Everybody should get yourself checked.

01:24:19.154 --> 01:24:21.063
That’s the best way.

01:24:23.443 --> 01:24:29.724
And we should be thankful to people for checking
us and giving us vibrations.

01:24:29.724 --> 01:24:32.943
Instead of getting angry and upset.

01:24:38.954 --> 01:24:41.824
How are the children?

01:24:41.824 --> 01:24:43.440
Jane [Brown] bring her.

01:24:43.464 --> 01:24:44.640
Is she alright?

01:24:44.725 --> 01:24:45.800
Bring her here.

01:24:45.805 --> 01:24:46.740
How is it?

01:24:46.770 --> 01:24:48.750
Let everybody check today

01:24:48.770 --> 01:24:50.360
and give bandhans.

01:27:51.841 --> 01:27:53.851
What about this gentleman?

01:27:53.861 --> 01:27:54.941
He’s got it?

01:27:54.981 --> 01:27:57.801
He’s Ray’s father, he should get it.

01:28:05.531 --> 01:28:09.471
Tell him not to feel guilty about anything!

01:28:09.535 --> 01:28:13.201
You are facing Mother who loves you!

01:28:13.521 --> 01:28:16.261
Just say, “Mother I am not guilty."

01:28:16.311 --> 01:28:17.341
Just say that.

01:28:17.401 --> 01:28:20.922
What guilt can you people have?

01:28:21.971 --> 01:28:23.551
Jill?

01:28:23.551 --> 01:28:25.131
Coming?

01:28:59.204 --> 01:29:00.794
Haaa!

01:29:01.834 --> 01:29:03.611
Alright Jill?

01:29:04.414 --> 01:29:06.701
It’s come up.

01:29:10.521 --> 01:29:11.941
How is she?

01:29:12.083 --> 01:29:14.143
Don’t talk.

01:29:14.162 --> 01:29:16.123
Just raise the Kundalini.

01:29:16.183 --> 01:29:18.003
Just raise the Kundalini.

01:30:05.209 --> 01:30:09.369
You give him a bandhan.

01:30:09.369 --> 01:30:13.029
Chaya, tumse karab dekho.

01:30:13.029 --> 01:30:22.869
Regis, you also get yourself checked and others
should check and you check others.

01:30:22.869 --> 01:30:25.459
Every one of you.

01:30:30.122 --> 01:30:32.922
John, please put yourself into a bandhan.

01:30:32.912 --> 01:30:34.652
Now check other people.

01:30:34.662 --> 01:30:35.962
Come along.

01:30:35.942 --> 01:30:39.862
Those who have been checking sit down and
those who have to be checked.

01:30:41.082 --> 01:30:42.353
You’ve done it?

01:30:42.402 --> 01:30:43.733
Have you done?

01:30:43.741 --> 01:30:44.953
You’ve got it?

01:30:45.132 --> 01:30:47.953
Have you felt anything?

01:30:48.002 --> 01:30:50.083
Did you feel any cool breeze?

01:30:50.102 --> 01:30:51.102
Good, great.

01:30:51.153 --> 01:30:52.153
Now close your eyes.

01:30:52.153 --> 01:30:53.153
Enjoy your Self.

01:30:53.153 --> 01:30:54.243
Now don’t stop at that!

01:30:54.243 --> 01:30:57.243
What do you say Malcolm?

01:30:57.243 --> 01:30:58.283
Better?

01:30:58.283 --> 01:31:02.463
What about this child?
