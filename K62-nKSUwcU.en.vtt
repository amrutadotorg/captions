00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:15.081
Today is the happiest day for all of you,
for the whole universe, because Shri Ganesha

00:00:15.081 --> 00:00:16.821
was created.

00:00:16.821 --> 00:00:30.401
He was created to emit auspiciousness through
His Chaitanya [- Divine Vibrations –ed.].

00:00:30.401 --> 00:00:39.670
First, the whole cosmos was filled with this
Chaitanyasrishti [- creation of Divine Vibrations

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:40.670
–ed.].

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:49.330
Then Brahmadeva came into play, and He created
all the matter.

00:00:49.330 --> 00:01:06.261
But

00:01:06.261 --> 00:01:27.461
the greatest blessings of the Divine Power
was to symbolize Chaitanya, and this Chaitanya

00:01:27.461 --> 00:01:37.081
has many aspects, but specially in Shri Ganesha,
it is auspiciousness.

00:01:37.081 --> 00:01:43.971
In these modern times people have lost the
sense of auspiciousness.

00:01:43.971 --> 00:01:51.491
Everything that emits vibrations, Chaitanya,
is auspicious, is shubh, and whatever does

00:01:51.491 --> 00:01:58.161
not is not by any chance auspicious.

00:01:58.161 --> 00:02:07.781
So first of all, whatever you worship, whatever
you accept, all of them have to be auspicious

00:02:07.781 --> 00:02:09.601
things.

00:02:09.601 --> 00:02:18.980
Every shape has a coefficience and all these
shapes which you see, not necessarily give

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.870
vibrations.

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:28.831
But in the human beings also, we find there
are many people, like you, who have Chaitanya

00:02:28.831 --> 00:02:30.700
flowing in them.

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:38.150
But this Chaitanya when it flows, we just
take Shri Ganesha for granted.

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.411
We do not understand that we have to awaken
Shri Ganesha within us.

00:02:43.411 --> 00:02:44.411
Means what?

00:02:44.411 --> 00:02:46.501
What we have to do?

00:02:46.501 --> 00:02:55.461
There is Shri Ganesha already existing in
you and as I said that innocence cannot be

00:02:55.461 --> 00:03:03.281
lost, so Shri Ganesha is eternal being, eternal
child – He cannot be lost and He cannot

00:03:03.281 --> 00:03:04.941
be destroyed.

00:03:04.941 --> 00:03:07.170
So He’s all the time there.

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:21.210
Maybe some clouds of your ill doings are covering
the great personality of innocence.

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:27.120
But it is always there present.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:35.420
So now, what should we do to keep this Ganesha
all the time shining within us?

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:44.680
Is to first remember that you were made in
the same pattern as Shri Ganesh.

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:54.221
But His Kundalini is on His stomach; His pure
desire is on His stomach.

00:03:54.221 --> 00:04:06.751
It’s very significant to understand why
it is there that His Kundalini is on His stomach.

00:04:06.751 --> 00:04:18.931
That means He does not have to conquer the
temptations of Mooladhara at all.

00:04:18.931 --> 00:04:28.161
But He has His Kundalini on His stomach, that
means He is also beyond the temptations of

00:04:28.161 --> 00:04:47.061
food, of power or anything because His stomach
represents absolute abandonment, absolute

00:04:47.061 --> 00:04:48.241
freedom.

00:04:48.241 --> 00:04:55.561
He’s not bothered as to how He looks that…
these days there is a big fashion that you

00:04:55.561 --> 00:04:56.681
cannot have a big belly.

00:04:56.681 --> 00:05:05.071
I mean this is becoming a big… not only
fashion but a big business.

00:05:05.071 --> 00:05:08.201
But as age grows, you have to have it.

00:05:08.201 --> 00:05:15.331
Even small children have that and they look
so sweet.

00:05:15.331 --> 00:05:23.191
Those people who are very thin must understand
that they might be getting some prizes in

00:05:23.191 --> 00:05:38.321
the… maybe beauty contest or something,
but they do not have that majesty, that royalty,

00:05:38.321 --> 00:05:43.001
that dignity in them as they should have.

00:05:43.001 --> 00:05:46.601
So Shri Ganesha accepts everything.

00:05:46.601 --> 00:05:53.371
He has a head with a trunk.

00:05:53.371 --> 00:05:55.941
He accepts it.

00:05:55.941 --> 00:05:59.211
Of course, is important, He should have that.

00:05:59.211 --> 00:06:05.161
Because head of the elephant suggests that
He is not like a human being who develops

00:06:05.161 --> 00:06:14.991
ego, superego, conditionings, but He is just
all the time one with the Divine.

00:06:14.991 --> 00:06:21.431
He accepts His body, He accepts His head,
He accepts His ears, He accepts everything

00:06:21.431 --> 00:06:24.501
that He is made of.

00:06:24.501 --> 00:06:32.871
He doesn’t aspire to something – some
entrepreneurs put some ideas and He wouldn’t

00:06:32.871 --> 00:06:34.811
go run after them.

00:06:34.811 --> 00:06:43.571
He won’t try to change Himself; He won’t
try to create that fashion and all that.

00:06:43.571 --> 00:06:56.371
He is what He is… because He is a satisfied
soul.

00:06:56.371 --> 00:07:09.971
The Kundalini on the stomach shows a complete,
self-contented, satisfied personality of Shri

00:07:09.971 --> 00:07:11.941
Ganesha.

00:07:11.941 --> 00:07:22.551
When you have all the powers within you, you
know you are powerful, then you don’t hanker

00:07:22.551 --> 00:07:32.741
after all these things and you don’t try
to make a position or an impression of others.

00:07:32.741 --> 00:07:41.891
For example, He would never go and read books
like how to impress people.

00:07:41.891 --> 00:07:47.611
Very common.

00:07:47.611 --> 00:07:56.191
So now, as you are created in the same image
of Shri Ganesh, you have to understand that

00:07:56.191 --> 00:08:04.451
you have to accept whatever God has given
you, whatever position He has given you.

00:08:04.451 --> 00:08:05.941
Same with Christ.

00:08:05.941 --> 00:08:11.181
Christ accepted His father who was just a
carpenter.

00:08:11.181 --> 00:08:17.721
He didn’t aspire for something higher or
some sort of a special position or a power

00:08:17.721 --> 00:08:28.211
because He was so powerful – what more power
can He have?

00:08:28.211 --> 00:08:35.261
Though people mocked at Him and laughed at
Him and could not accept what He was saying,

00:08:35.261 --> 00:08:42.671
but still He was self-contented, self-satisfied.

00:08:42.671 --> 00:08:44.791
He knew what it was.

00:08:44.791 --> 00:08:55.341
So, for a Sahaja Yogi first thing is to be
self-contented.

00:08:55.341 --> 00:09:05.971
As I told you, the fundamentals of the western
life is to see and to be seen.

00:09:05.971 --> 00:09:16.981
Both things were missing completely in the
incarnation of Shri Ganesh.

00:09:16.981 --> 00:09:22.421
So when I say these things, suddenly people
start thinking, “Let us become hippies,

00:09:22.421 --> 00:09:27.651
or let them become punks, or let us become
this, let us become that.”

00:09:27.651 --> 00:09:29.591
You don’t have to become anything.

00:09:29.591 --> 00:09:36.801
Whatever you have – your body, your face,
your hair – everything is there, just meant

00:09:36.801 --> 00:09:42.031
for you.

00:09:42.031 --> 00:09:56.661
You don’t have to change anything outwardly
because inside is complete Chaitanya.

00:09:56.661 --> 00:10:02.801
Shri Ganesha never tried to change Himself.

00:10:02.801 --> 00:10:17.911
Though there were so many clouds on His being,
though many people insulted Him, tortured

00:10:17.911 --> 00:10:27.891
Him, hanged Him, crucified Him, still the
Eternal Being didn’t bother.

00:10:27.891 --> 00:10:41.391
So the first and foremost thing for a Sahaja
Yogi is to accept, go on accepting things.

00:10:41.391 --> 00:10:46.571
But when I say accept, I must say the other
side also: that doesn’t mean you start accepting

00:10:46.571 --> 00:10:51.251
bhoots, all the bad qualities of others.

00:10:51.251 --> 00:10:57.431
“Mother, You said you must accept”, so
they’ll start accepting all these bad qualities.

00:10:57.431 --> 00:10:58.751
“What’s wrong?

00:10:58.751 --> 00:11:01.481
You have said it already.”

00:11:01.481 --> 00:11:05.901
Whatever I say has another side, always.

00:11:05.901 --> 00:11:10.101
Like I said, “Now you have become your own
Guru.”

00:11:10.101 --> 00:11:13.841
So, “Why should we listen to anybody else?”

00:11:13.841 --> 00:11:30.501
Like this, you see, we go on diverting ourselves,
deviating ourselves from reality just to cheat

00:11:30.501 --> 00:11:32.661
ourselves.

00:11:32.661 --> 00:11:37.831
And this comes because we have no wisdom.

00:11:37.831 --> 00:11:44.211
We have no wisdom because we do not know what
is for our benevolence, what is for our good,

00:11:44.211 --> 00:11:45.781
what we should do for our good.

00:11:45.781 --> 00:11:49.711
I mean even if we know, we don’t want to
do it.

00:11:49.711 --> 00:11:53.001
So, what we lack is wisdom.

00:11:53.001 --> 00:11:58.430
That’s a vicious circle, I must say, that
Ganesha is to be awakened to give you wisdom

00:11:58.430 --> 00:12:08.961
– He is the giver of wisdom, He is the giver
of wisdom – and He has to give you the wisdom,

00:12:08.961 --> 00:12:14.111
He is to be awakened; but you are not wise
because He is not awakened.

00:12:14.111 --> 00:12:19.880
It’s a very vicious circle.

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:23.421
How to make this vicious circle break?

00:12:23.421 --> 00:12:29.851
That “Let my wisdom shine in my attention.

00:12:29.851 --> 00:12:38.741
Let Shri Ganesha throw His light in my attention.”

00:12:38.741 --> 00:12:44.481
Mentally you people are very alert, no doubt.

00:12:44.481 --> 00:12:54.071
And you can always cheat yourself nicely.

00:12:54.071 --> 00:13:05.911
That’s the point where you could see yourself
– introspection, which I have seen among

00:13:05.911 --> 00:13:10.211
Russians.

00:13:10.211 --> 00:13:14.521
Just introspect: “Why do I do like that?

00:13:14.521 --> 00:13:17.630
Why cannot I meditate?

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:23.431
Am I going to miss out?

00:13:23.431 --> 00:13:31.851
Why can I not do something that is good for
me?”

00:13:31.851 --> 00:13:41.991
Introspection is the only way you can see
yourself how far you are from Shri Ganesh.

00:13:41.991 --> 00:13:53.851
Even, I have seen, when I say something in
general, people always – the mind is very

00:13:53.851 --> 00:13:59.431
clever – thinks that I am talking about
somebody else, not about them.

00:13:59.431 --> 00:14:08.151
It’s a convex mind, convex, which never
receives anything inside itself because there

00:14:08.151 --> 00:14:13.551
is no wisdom.

00:14:13.551 --> 00:14:24.101
If you are wise, then not only that you’ll
accept but you’ll understand and it will

00:14:24.101 --> 00:14:29.941
penetrate into your attention through your
central nervous system.

00:14:29.941 --> 00:14:33.581
You just know that this is it.

00:14:33.581 --> 00:14:41.402
Now you know that this… you put your hand
towards this candle, it… you’ll… your

00:14:41.402 --> 00:14:42.531
fingers might burn.

00:14:42.531 --> 00:14:48.491
You know it definitely, with experience, and
you won’t do that.

00:14:48.491 --> 00:14:56.901
With experience you have learnt not to put
your hand on to the candle.

00:14:56.901 --> 00:15:02.571
And this wisdom is there, I don’t have to
tell you that.

00:15:02.571 --> 00:15:06.471
But this is a new life you have started – a
spiritual life.

00:15:06.471 --> 00:15:15.271
When you are going into the spiritual life,
try to remember your experiences, one after

00:15:15.271 --> 00:15:20.831
another: how you got transformed, how you
changed, how many the bad things that you

00:15:20.831 --> 00:15:25.851
had disappeared gradually and how you have
become so nice.

00:15:25.851 --> 00:15:34.571
This will take away your depression – to
begin with.

00:15:34.571 --> 00:15:38.981
Then you should think that, “What do I have
to do further?

00:15:38.981 --> 00:15:40.241
Am I really wise, or I’m stupid?”

00:15:40.241 --> 00:15:50.391
There are lots of stages between absolute
stupidity and absolute wisdom, and you see

00:15:50.391 --> 00:16:01.031
all those shades all over, and combinations
and permutations of these I see every day.

00:16:01.031 --> 00:16:12.621
And I am surprised that after getting your
Self Realization, when Shri Ganesha is shining

00:16:12.621 --> 00:16:20.861
in your attention, you should see your reflection
clearly and try to correct it.

00:16:20.861 --> 00:16:29.861
Only this much wisdom if you have that, “I
have to work out my benevolence”, you’ll

00:16:29.861 --> 00:16:32.940
do it.

00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:39.130
I know of somebody who would never get up
in the mornings, say for example.

00:16:39.130 --> 00:16:44.571
But one day I saw him ready at about six o’clock
in the morning – I was surprised.

00:16:44.571 --> 00:16:50.050
How this gentleman who has no self-discipline
has suddenly got up at six o’clock and ready

00:16:50.050 --> 00:16:51.751
to go somewhere.

00:16:51.751 --> 00:16:55.881
I said, “Where are you going?”

00:16:55.881 --> 00:16:58.281
“You don’t know?”

00:16:58.281 --> 00:16:59.281
I said, “What?”

00:16:59.281 --> 00:17:06.190
“I have got a job now and I have to be present
at 8 o’clock and it will take two hours

00:17:06.190 --> 00:17:07.391
to reach that place.

00:17:07.391 --> 00:17:09.410
Also, I am keeping some margin.

00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:10.951
So I have to leave now.

00:17:10.951 --> 00:17:13.101
I can’t talk to You even.”

00:17:13.101 --> 00:17:17.711
Quite alert, awake.

00:17:17.711 --> 00:17:27.341
Now, what is the thing is as far as money
is concerned, lot of wisdom is there.

00:17:27.341 --> 00:17:35.191
Don’t have to tell them, that is automatically.

00:17:35.191 --> 00:17:46.321
Money wisdom is quite a lot, job wisdom is
quite a lot.

00:17:46.321 --> 00:17:58.491
Because these things means prestige in the
society, this means security in the society.

00:17:58.491 --> 00:18:04.871
So this kind of business you find in many
people and in some even that is missing.

00:18:04.871 --> 00:18:10.291
They don’t even understand that they have
to earn their living.

00:18:10.291 --> 00:18:20.211
But that’s the minimum, you cannot be parasite.

00:18:20.211 --> 00:18:26.451
Then the second stage, as I said by many stages,
is this: that we are not for money, money

00:18:26.451 --> 00:18:36.091
is for us.

00:18:36.091 --> 00:18:48.871
The attention if it is on your Spirit, on
the Ganesha Principle, then whole situation

00:18:48.871 --> 00:18:51.681
will change.

00:18:51.681 --> 00:18:57.301
Your priorities will change.

00:18:57.301 --> 00:19:01.531
And suddenly people will say, “Mother, what
has happened to this gentleman?

00:19:01.531 --> 00:19:13.081
He was a stupid fool, now he has become such
a wise person.”

00:19:13.081 --> 00:19:18.081
So to awaken Shri Ganesha you should have
minimum wisdom already there.

00:19:18.081 --> 00:19:22.611
I mean, even if that is not there, how can
you work it out?

00:19:22.611 --> 00:19:31.561
Is not meant for stupid people, Moodhas, not
meant for Moodh.

00:19:31.561 --> 00:19:34.531
So now what is our benevolence is?

00:19:34.531 --> 00:19:39.531
Let us see.

00:19:39.531 --> 00:19:41.361
Is it money?

00:19:41.361 --> 00:19:42.951
No.

00:19:42.951 --> 00:19:50.831
Those who have money don’t seem to be very
happy people always.

00:19:50.831 --> 00:19:52.501
Then what is the next, is jobs?

00:19:52.501 --> 00:19:57.831
Those who have jobs – all right, should
have jobs, I am not saying you should be jobless.

00:19:57.831 --> 00:20:05.371
I mean immediately the another side they will
take, I mean so quick you know, that, “Mother

00:20:05.371 --> 00:20:13.361
is saying we can be jobless you see, nice.”

00:20:13.361 --> 00:20:15.141
Immediate, escapes.

00:20:15.141 --> 00:20:23.001
Now, then the power: you want to have political
power, this social power, this power, that

00:20:23.001 --> 00:20:29.821
power – is absolutely a joyless pursuit.

00:20:29.821 --> 00:20:37.811
You go and see those people who are supposed
to be powerful, so called, half way they are

00:20:37.811 --> 00:20:48.400
towards hell, one foot there and one foot
here and about to be gulped down by the crocodiles.

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:54.520
You can see it clearly.

00:20:54.520 --> 00:21:00.650
Specially in this Kali Yuga it’s so obvious,
so clear-cut.

00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:08.851
We don’t want to be like them, we want to
be like Shri Ganesh.

00:21:08.851 --> 00:21:14.871
So once you start accepting your circumstances,
accepting your body, your… accepting your

00:21:14.871 --> 00:21:33.030
face, everything, you will see that lot of
time will be saved.

00:21:33.030 --> 00:21:43.371
Another problem that faces us is planning.

00:21:43.371 --> 00:21:46.791
And that is missing in Shri Ganesha completely.

00:21:46.791 --> 00:21:49.401
He did not do any planning whatsoever.

00:21:49.401 --> 00:21:56.601
I wish He had done some planning, things would
have been much better.

00:21:56.601 --> 00:22:03.351
He doesn’t believe in planning because He
is so powerful.

00:22:03.351 --> 00:22:07.811
Whatever He wants, He can get it done.

00:22:07.811 --> 00:22:08.811
You want the sun?

00:22:08.811 --> 00:22:10.891
All right the sun is there.

00:22:10.891 --> 00:22:11.891
You want the moon?

00:22:11.891 --> 00:22:12.891
Moon is there.

00:22:12.891 --> 00:22:13.891
You want the stars?

00:22:13.891 --> 00:22:14.891
Stars is there.

00:22:14.891 --> 00:22:26.381
The
dust of His feet can create the whole universe

00:22:26.381 --> 00:22:32.071
– universes after universes.

00:22:32.071 --> 00:22:44.071
For such a person, there is no need to be
planning everything because whatever He wants

00:22:44.071 --> 00:22:47.081
happens.

00:22:47.081 --> 00:22:50.131
But why, why it happens?

00:22:50.131 --> 00:22:54.841
Why He has this power?

00:22:54.841 --> 00:22:59.160
Because He is in that state.

00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:07.671
Are you in that state?

00:23:07.671 --> 00:23:10.641
You have not achieved that state.

00:23:10.641 --> 00:23:21.351
You talk somebody… tell somebody that, “Oh
my, I have to go and catch the plane.”

00:23:21.351 --> 00:23:26.751
There are ten people standing next to you,
they’ll all get panicky.

00:23:26.751 --> 00:23:33.900
I have to go, and they are bothered; something
sort of goes off their heads.

00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:37.780
I don’t know what goes, they go amuck.

00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:39.231
I never tell them like that.

00:23:39.231 --> 00:23:44.661
I say, “There’s still time for the plane
to go, and don’t worry.

00:23:44.661 --> 00:23:53.511
When I reach there then the plane will leave
so you don’t worry.”

00:23:53.511 --> 00:24:06.821
But because of this kind of a… presumptions,
and the planning system of the mind, you just

00:24:06.821 --> 00:24:11.821
think that, “Now I have a plan to go today,
I must go.”

00:24:11.821 --> 00:24:12.821
Why?

00:24:12.821 --> 00:24:15.111
I won’t go.

00:24:15.111 --> 00:24:17.701
I may decide at the last minute I don’t
want to go.

00:24:17.701 --> 00:24:20.151
I’ll make the plane go away.

00:24:20.151 --> 00:24:25.201
We did that many a times, you know very well.

00:24:25.201 --> 00:24:33.011
I wanted to buy the Rome Ashram, so I saw
to it that the plane never arrived.

00:24:33.011 --> 00:24:38.011
But you have to be in that state.

00:24:38.011 --> 00:24:41.241
Specially buying this Cabella, you know what
happened.

00:24:41.241 --> 00:24:49.311
There were five great intellectuals on My
head sitting.

00:24:49.311 --> 00:24:54.201
I didn’t know how I will manage these five
intellectuals with all their planning, this,

00:24:54.201 --> 00:25:03.581
that; they made Me run up and down, do this
and that, Ultimately they all had to come

00:25:03.581 --> 00:25:05.591
here.

00:25:05.591 --> 00:25:07.631
But I was telling them, “Go and have a look.”

00:25:07.631 --> 00:25:19.131
Nobody would look at it, nobody would listen
to Me, nobody wanted to know about it.

00:25:19.131 --> 00:25:32.131
How things work out – is your pure desire
that can work out anything that you want.

00:25:32.131 --> 00:25:36.051
But you won’t want funny things also.

00:25:36.051 --> 00:25:41.041
Like Shri Ganesha would not like to follow
some entrepreneur who is saying, “Have a

00:25:41.041 --> 00:25:44.770
punk on your head”, or something.

00:25:44.770 --> 00:25:49.201
Is stupidity, all kinds of stupidities.

00:25:49.201 --> 00:25:55.351
Because you are stupid, these entrepreneurs
are having a good time; they can befool us

00:25:55.351 --> 00:25:57.941
all the time.

00:25:57.941 --> 00:26:10.281
At His state, He is Himself, on top of the
pure desire.

00:26:10.281 --> 00:26:16.241
The pure desire is on His stomach, tied up
nicely.

00:26:16.241 --> 00:26:33.631
It is to be seen in Sahaja Yoga how things
work out, how miraculously they work out,

00:26:33.631 --> 00:26:36.051
and these can happen to you also.

00:26:36.051 --> 00:26:42.681
All these Powers can come to you also.

00:26:42.681 --> 00:26:47.941
You know about some people who came to us
who didn’t know even how to sing.

00:26:47.941 --> 00:26:52.261
I mean, they had no voices; something very
funny they had – I mean I didn’t know

00:26:52.261 --> 00:26:57.890
from where they learnt to even talk.

00:26:57.890 --> 00:27:03.501
When they opened their mouths, if you were
at one note, they were on another note and

00:27:03.501 --> 00:27:09.071
they went on and on and on without even listening
to what they were singing.

00:27:09.071 --> 00:27:17.141
After some time, I find they are singing beautifully.

00:27:17.141 --> 00:27:21.941
So the Kundalini itself is working it out,
the pure desire is working it out, but what

00:27:21.941 --> 00:27:23.471
about you?

00:27:23.471 --> 00:27:29.791
What are you doing about it is to be seen.

00:27:29.791 --> 00:27:43.331
There are so many things that could be understood
very easily through the lifestyle of Shri

00:27:43.331 --> 00:27:44.341
Ganesha.

00:27:44.341 --> 00:27:58.900
The first and foremost thing for Him is to
obey His Mother – never to say no, no question,

00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:08.071
and also not to ask why.

00:28:08.071 --> 00:28:16.221
He will go and fight with all the Gods and
Goddesses and every one.

00:28:16.221 --> 00:28:23.351
And that’s what Christ has said, “Anything
against Me I’ve tolerated but nothing against

00:28:23.351 --> 00:28:28.010
the Holy Ghost.”

00:28:28.010 --> 00:28:42.701
There should be no question, there should
be no explanation.

00:28:42.701 --> 00:28:52.081
Sometimes even My patience goes out, the way
they do not want to accept what I am telling

00:28:52.081 --> 00:28:53.081
them.

00:28:53.081 --> 00:28:58.131
At the end of course they all come around,
no doubt – at the end.

00:28:58.131 --> 00:29:01.491
But you waste so much time convincing them.

00:29:01.491 --> 00:29:04.751
What is the reason?

00:29:04.751 --> 00:29:08.531
They have no wisdom to know what their Mother
is.

00:29:08.531 --> 00:29:17.751
Like, you know the story of Shri Ganesha that
His Mother said, “The one who goes round

00:29:17.751 --> 00:29:23.640
the Mother Earth, I will give you a present.”

00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:34.760
So, Ganesha again accepts a little mouse as
a transport – imagine.

00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:41.231
Nowadays people can’t believe it that Shri
Ganesha, so powerful, should accept just a

00:29:41.231 --> 00:29:43.701
mouse for His transport.

00:29:43.701 --> 00:29:55.451
Because He’s so humble; he doesn’t have
to show off His Lincoln or Mercedes to anyone;

00:29:55.451 --> 00:30:01.711
He is very comfortable with His mouse.

00:30:01.711 --> 00:30:05.001
Now what does He do?

00:30:05.001 --> 00:30:07.991
He thinks that…

00:30:07.991 --> 00:30:14.891
He understands, in no time, that His Mother
is much greater than the Mother Earth.

00:30:14.891 --> 00:30:19.410
“So why should I go round the Mother Earth?”

00:30:19.410 --> 00:30:26.851
His brother is going round on a peacock.

00:30:26.851 --> 00:30:32.061
He just goes round His Mother – He gets
the present.

00:30:32.061 --> 00:30:46.621
It’s such a simple thing to understand because
He is the wisest person.

00:30:46.621 --> 00:31:03.271
The wisest person knows what is what, he knows
who is who, he knows what are the qualities

00:31:03.271 --> 00:31:05.381
of these persons.

00:31:05.381 --> 00:31:16.311
He is not impressed by superficial things,
no.

00:31:16.311 --> 00:31:24.441
If somebody is well dressed, then people get
very much impressed by them, and they turn

00:31:24.441 --> 00:31:37.681
out to be bank robbers – walking with umbrellas
and with lined suits, as if some big executives

00:31:37.681 --> 00:31:48.071
are coming, and they decamp with all the loot.

00:31:48.071 --> 00:32:00.481
So for a wise person, the superficial behavior
doesn’t appeal, not bothered.

00:32:00.481 --> 00:32:16.130
It is a kind of a very penetrating intelligence;
just like a computer you know.

00:32:16.130 --> 00:32:18.471
In a second you know that what is this gentleman.

00:32:18.471 --> 00:32:25.650
Oh, he may come with a great, you see, ado
and he might come and praise you and do this

00:32:25.650 --> 00:32:35.211
and do that and you know the person very well.

00:32:35.211 --> 00:32:46.041
If some body is unduly very friendly, very
kind, very nice, not necessarily that he is

00:32:46.041 --> 00:32:56.650
really appreciating you but he is looking
at your purse, maybe, maybe something else.

00:32:56.650 --> 00:33:06.160
But not only on this level, it is even on
a spiritual level we have to understand how

00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:18.191
people try to put you down spiritually; what
they try, what tricks they try on you.

00:33:18.191 --> 00:33:26.231
It could be your husband, your wife, your
children, your relations, your friends, anybody,

00:33:26.231 --> 00:33:28.301
any Sahaja Yogi.

00:33:28.301 --> 00:33:31.321
But in the case of Shri Ganesha, it’s the
other way round.

00:33:31.321 --> 00:33:37.721
They say that if you put one apple, bad apple,
all the apples get spoilt.

00:33:37.721 --> 00:33:49.001
But if you put Shri Ganesha among all the
bad apples, they’ll get all right.

00:33:49.001 --> 00:33:53.981
Because He’s the life-giving force.

00:33:53.981 --> 00:34:09.971
This is one of the greatest qualities, that
He knows that He is the source of life and

00:34:09.971 --> 00:34:13.371
He gives life, He gives Chaitanya.

00:34:13.371 --> 00:34:21.651
He doesn’t say… think that, “Now supposing
I give Chaitanya, give life to this person,

00:34:21.651 --> 00:34:25.061
my ego will come up,” – very common problem.

00:34:25.061 --> 00:34:32.151
“Mother I don’t want to do it because
my ego will come up.”

00:34:32.151 --> 00:34:36.220
Everybody is psychoanalyzing themselves ‘because
this will happen’ – Baba!

00:34:36.220 --> 00:34:38.101
[- Hindi expression of a general exclamatory
nature –ed.]

00:34:38.101 --> 00:34:42.811
You are all realized souls now, you are all
saints.

00:34:42.811 --> 00:34:49.011
The false people are talking so big, and you
the people who have got something are still

00:34:49.011 --> 00:34:52.351
thinking, “My ego will come up, this will
happen.”

00:34:52.351 --> 00:34:58.231
No, no, you have the powers.

00:34:58.231 --> 00:35:09.051
But as you keep it under a manger, as Christ
has said, the light will go out.

00:35:09.051 --> 00:35:20.970
You have to give it to others, you have to
open it out.

00:35:20.970 --> 00:35:23.051
And that is how you will judge your state.

00:35:23.051 --> 00:35:25.701
“What is my state?

00:35:25.701 --> 00:35:27.771
Let’s see.

00:35:27.771 --> 00:35:30.861
Where am I?”

00:35:30.861 --> 00:35:38.351
That confidence, take it from Me, should be
with you.

00:35:38.351 --> 00:35:43.891
All of you have to work out this way.

00:35:43.891 --> 00:35:45.871
Very many…

00:35:45.871 --> 00:35:48.141
“Mother, my Mooladhara is caught up.”

00:35:48.141 --> 00:35:52.021
How dare anybody catch Mooladhar?

00:35:52.021 --> 00:35:56.071
That’s the anger of Shri Ganesha.

00:35:56.071 --> 00:35:59.361
How dare?

00:35:59.361 --> 00:36:02.970
How can anybody?

00:36:02.970 --> 00:36:11.771
What’s missing is complete faith in yourself
and faith in your Mother.

00:36:11.771 --> 00:36:19.751
In Russia recently… in Prague, there was
a lady who was brought on the stage, very

00:36:19.751 --> 00:36:20.951
old lady, couldn’t walk.

00:36:20.951 --> 00:36:27.220
I mean they just carried her and she came
and sat before Me on a chair.

00:36:27.220 --> 00:36:29.481
She said, “I know You…

00:36:29.481 --> 00:36:30.831
I’ll be cured.

00:36:30.831 --> 00:36:34.741
I am in Your presence; I know I will be cured.”

00:36:34.741 --> 00:36:35.861
I said, “Then get up.”

00:36:35.861 --> 00:36:37.091
She got up.

00:36:37.091 --> 00:36:41.631
Those who were with Me in Prague, you can
ask them.

00:36:41.631 --> 00:36:47.970
She came down and she started running, and
everybody laughed.

00:36:47.970 --> 00:37:00.651
But her faith – she was not a Sahaja Yogini
as such – but she was sure; she knew Me.

00:37:00.651 --> 00:37:04.761
And she just started running like that and
everybody started looking at her.

00:37:04.761 --> 00:37:13.461
Same thing happened in Russia for many people
– very serious diseases.

00:37:13.461 --> 00:37:22.460
So that, one thing is for sure, either you
don’t know that you are realized souls or

00:37:22.460 --> 00:37:26.731
else you don’t know Me, one of the two things.

00:37:26.731 --> 00:37:29.741
Why was He so obedient to His Mother?

00:37:29.741 --> 00:37:31.411
Why was He?

00:37:31.411 --> 00:37:33.191
Because that was the wisest thing to do.

00:37:33.191 --> 00:37:45.411
The one who knows everything, it’s better
to be guided by that person.

00:37:45.411 --> 00:37:49.791
And many a times I have seen, people try to
do things without telling Me, important things

00:37:49.791 --> 00:37:52.660
– they fall into traps.

00:37:52.660 --> 00:37:59.901
Then they come back to Me and I tell them
the solution, it works.

00:37:59.901 --> 00:38:05.461
It’s not necessary that you should tell
Me everything.

00:38:05.461 --> 00:38:16.541
But when you are in a fix, you can always
just go into yourself and ask yourself, “What

00:38:16.541 --> 00:38:17.571
would Mother do?”

00:38:17.571 --> 00:38:20.511
You’ll get the answer.

00:38:20.511 --> 00:38:22.861
You are at a… quite a higher state.

00:38:22.861 --> 00:38:28.281
But still, even if you are on a tree and you
are still thinking you are falling down, you

00:38:28.281 --> 00:38:30.531
are nowhere.

00:38:30.531 --> 00:38:32.781
Steady yourself.

00:38:32.781 --> 00:38:42.621
That’s what is, we say, the Adhishthan of
Shri Ganesha.

00:38:42.621 --> 00:38:51.331
Is the steadiness, steadiness in your achievements
of Sahaj Yog.

00:38:51.331 --> 00:38:59.171
Believing in yourself that you have entered
into the new world, into the new atmosphere

00:39:00.909 --> 00:39:06.322
It is for you now, to work it out.

00:39:06.323 --> 00:39:13.503
Shri Ganesha is just waiting.

00:39:13.503 --> 00:39:17.393
But He is not meant for people who have no
courage.

00:39:17.393 --> 00:39:34.376
Such a courageous man who could go and fight
with all the Devas, because He knew the Shakti

00:39:34.376 --> 00:39:40.983
was with Him.

00:39:40.983 --> 00:39:50.343
Today is such a joyous day for Me because
we have children, and we are dealing with

00:39:50.343 --> 00:39:51.343
children.

00:39:51.343 --> 00:39:53.343
Most of them are born realized.

00:39:53.343 --> 00:40:04.343
They are of a very special category, I have
told you many a times, but we spoil them;

00:40:04.343 --> 00:40:12.453
because we were not born realized, so we don’t
know how to handle these children, we spoil

00:40:12.453 --> 00:40:13.453
them.

00:40:13.453 --> 00:40:18.983
Not only we spoil them, but we interfere with
the school, we interfere with this as if we

00:40:18.983 --> 00:40:29.103
are the wisest parents ever living.

00:40:29.103 --> 00:40:35.613
Because we are Sahaja Yogis, we have to be
much more sensible than other parents.

00:40:35.613 --> 00:40:39.123
How can you interfere with any school anywhere?

00:40:39.123 --> 00:40:47.143
But in Sahaja Yoga you will.

00:40:47.143 --> 00:40:57.373
It is because there is no wisdom and no understanding
what is good and benevolent for your child.

00:40:57.373 --> 00:41:02.343
If you love your child, then you must think
of its benevolent.

00:41:02.343 --> 00:41:09.233
You must learn from the experience what happens
to children if they are left like that.

00:41:09.233 --> 00:41:16.383
You cannot spoil your child, you cannot because
it’s a special category of children they

00:41:16.383 --> 00:41:17.383
are.

00:41:17.383 --> 00:41:28.723
They are not children who can become vagabonds;
they cannot become thieves.

00:41:28.723 --> 00:41:36.413
So you will make them something funny – they
are neither here nor there.

00:41:36.413 --> 00:41:45.013
They are born realized and they have to be
channelized properly, to achieve their complete

00:41:45.013 --> 00:41:52.843
manifestation of their Spirit.

00:41:52.843 --> 00:42:03.022
So the possessiveness and the stupid attachments
to children must be given up.

00:42:03.022 --> 00:42:08.853
There is no force on you – if you want to
destroy a child, you can destroy.

00:42:08.853 --> 00:42:15.503
But in an advice – if you were Ganeshas,
you would have understood it, I don’t have

00:42:15.503 --> 00:42:19.693
to explain so much.

00:42:19.693 --> 00:42:27.353
What is good for your child, because we have
to have beautiful children.

00:42:27.353 --> 00:42:29.643
They are born beautiful children, I tell you.

00:42:29.643 --> 00:42:34.373
If they are spoilt, it is because of you,
you have spoilt them.

00:42:34.373 --> 00:42:36.793
You have ruined them.

00:42:36.793 --> 00:42:39.353
You are responsible.

00:42:39.353 --> 00:42:47.253
I know of so many children – they’re very,
very sweet.

00:42:47.253 --> 00:42:54.953
I have conference with them also and I find
them much more congenial; I have much better

00:42:54.953 --> 00:43:00.113
rapport with them than I can have with you.

00:43:00.113 --> 00:43:03.193
They never argue, never.

00:43:03.193 --> 00:43:14.042
They never says no, and they have very good
information about all of you.

00:43:14.042 --> 00:43:20.983
So it is such a nice thing that today you
should desire that our children should very

00:43:20.983 --> 00:43:31.833
soon become the images of Shri Ganesha, His
Ganas, who have to work out so much.

00:43:31.833 --> 00:43:35.113
It’s a tremendous task.

00:43:35.113 --> 00:43:43.093
Sahaja Yoga is the greatest achievement of
Spiritual evolution.

00:43:43.093 --> 00:43:47.693
We all have to dedicate ourselves.

00:43:47.693 --> 00:43:53.663
We don’t have to sacrifice anything as the
Saints have sacrificed – nothing, don’t

00:43:53.663 --> 00:43:55.243
have to suffer anything.

00:43:55.243 --> 00:43:58.143
Only thing you have to have – wisdom.

00:43:58.143 --> 00:44:04.562
For that, I am very happy that today we are
worshipping Shri Ganesha.

00:44:04.562 --> 00:44:13.263
So the pure desire should be that, “Shri
Ganesha please give us Divine Wisdom.”

00:44:13.263 --> 00:44:15.243
That’s all.

00:44:15.243 --> 00:44:18.126
It contains everything in it.

00:44:18.127 --> 00:44:20.112
May God bless you.
