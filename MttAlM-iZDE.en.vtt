1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.920
so much. Hi everybody. We're here in Cincinnati, Ohio, and I will have a couple of other people

2
00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:19.920
from Cincinnati that are going to say a few words as well. But I'd kind of like to start this by

3
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:27.520
showing you all a very short video of our dear friend Carolyn so that you can get an idea of

4
00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:39.120
who she is and how she... just who she is. And this was taken at her 80th birthday party

5
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:46.720
about four years ago. And during that time, you know, everybody was so happy and so jolly.

6
00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.040
But when she had a moment with the microphone, this is what she said to us.

7
00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.560
So can someone roll that for us, please?

8
00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:06.560
So

9
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.600
my hope is and I hope everybody will join me in this hope even though you're not 80.

10
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.200
You're going to be.

11
00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:35.280
And from now on, I will always have Sri Manaji's feet here and my attention on there.

12
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:43.680
And that I and we all will remember every time we go into a store or in any place public,

13
00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:50.880
remember the vibrations that we're spreading and not take it for granted and not forget about it.

14
00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:57.040
And my hope is also that we'll find some tremendously creative ways to spread Sahaja Yoga.

15
00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:03.520
In Cincinnati, we haven't completed this. In fact, we barely started.

16
00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:11.920
So that's my hope that everything will get moving. After all, I may only have 20 or 30 more years.

17
00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.000
So let's go.

18
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.520
So let's go.

19
00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:36.400
So as you can see, that was our beautiful Carolyn and how she was always thinking of Sahaj.

20
00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.920
I wanted to share with you all quite a few things about her life.

21
00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.640
So if you'll bear with me, I am going to read this. I kind of just

22
00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:53.040
decided that would be the best way. So we have two other speakers from Cincinnati,

23
00:02:53.040 --> 00:03:00.320
but I'll just start with this part of it. I first met Carolyn Vance in 1992 when she came with

24
00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:07.920
Sri Mataji to Cincinnati, and she traveled many times in the US with Sri Mataji. She was

25
00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:14.800
a constant companion for her. I was still just a few years new to Sahaj at that time and remembered

26
00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:21.840
being so impressed with this lovely, dignified lady traveling with mother. As a visit progressed,

27
00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:28.000
I found out we also shared a background in actively working for civil rights and for equal

28
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.320
rights for women. I was employed in TV and radio at the time, and it was wonderful to find another

29
00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:41.200
yogini who was also interested in politics and civil rights. But what I really learned from

30
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:50.320
Carolyn was how to listen to mother. Beyond her spiritual teachings, Sri Mataji often shared with

31
00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:58.640
us her ideas of what equality and harmony are and how Sahaja Yoga championed true equal rights.

32
00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:06.640
Carolyn incorporated many of those ideas in her book, It Takes a Mother. I feel privileged to

33
00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:13.040
have read it and to have done a first pass at preliminary editing of it. She then shifted to

34
00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:20.400
Richard and Felicity Paiment, who polished it and helped get it published. In It Takes a Mother,

35
00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:26.720
Carolyn writes a fictional but somewhat autobiographical story of a woman's fight for

36
00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:36.000
equality in Washington, DC's early TV. Equal rights broadcasting legislation was passed

37
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:43.920
and her work among American Indians. It culminates in self-realization. So this book, It Takes a

38
00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:52.320
Mother, is available on Amazon, and we intended to have her review it here. Alpina and I and others

39
00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:58.560
had talked about having her review it here on this site, but unfortunately our time with her

40
00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:05.360
ran out too quickly. But I urge you to go to Amazon and get It Takes a Mother. It will show

41
00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:11.600
you more than we can say in our few minutes here. Over the years as I got to know her better,

42
00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:18.000
I realized how well respected Carolyn was and how many yogis, old and young alike, turned to her

43
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:24.400
for advice. When you ask Carolyn about some problem, she was able to help you look at it

44
00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:31.920
from a self-realized vantage point. Whether it was an issue at the Kanahari School where she worked

45
00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:38.960
tirelessly or whether it was a collective problem, she did not shirk from difficulties. Sometime in

46
00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:46.240
early 2009, Carolyn took vibrations and decided to move to Cincinnati. And I think that date is right.

47
00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:52.560
A lot of us have debated that, but we're not really sure, but we think it was around 2009.

48
00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:59.600
She was an immediate asset to our collective as she's been to the other US collective she'd lived

49
00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:08.160
with or started herself. After Sri Mataji passed away in 2011, Carolyn was elected as President

50
00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:15.840
of the US Council. During a very difficult and tumultuous time, she held the US yogis together.

51
00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:22.240
We were grieving and many conflicting ideas for the future emerged, but Carolyn's faith in mother

52
00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:32.640
was steadfast and we slowly as a country regained our equilibrium. Here in Cincinnati, we conducted

53
00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:39.280
local public programs and Carolyn even brought guests across the Ohio River to my Covington,

54
00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:47.200
Kentucky programs. Vibrations always increased when she joined us. In her leisure time, Carolyn

55
00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:53.600
was a lot of fun to be with. We both loved music and enjoyed many concerts together from jazz on

56
00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:59.920
the outdoor salon of an African American orphanage to the symphony at our renowned music hall

57
00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:08.560
and to several choral performances featuring Sahaja yoginis. Carolyn loved many kinds of music

58
00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:14.560
and attending events with her made the experience ever more interesting. We once drove deep into

59
00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:19.920
Appalachia together to give realization at a corporate Kentucky high school as part of the

60
00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:26.640
Sahaja yoga health core project. In that event, after traveling for more than three hours,

61
00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:31.920
Carolyn was immediately on point and helped quickly engage high school students into

62
00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:38.720
trying meditation. With seemingly effortless remarks, she helped us interest those Appalachian

63
00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:45.120
high school kids in meditating. Afterwards, their faces were beaming and they sent us lovely thank

64
00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:51.920
you notes. When she had the collective meeting at her house, we all loved how beautifully she

65
00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:57.520
led the meeting and how lovingly she fed us delicious snacks and the young people were

66
00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:03.840
treated to Sahaja coloring books and games and anti-Carolyn study. They loved being around her.

67
00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:10.400
Carolyn was always ready to assist with important projects. She was instrumental in helping us

68
00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:16.960
conduct a Love America tour where teams of visiting European youth helped us blitz many

69
00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:22.720
businesses, schools, and mental health centers with the experience of Sahaja yoga. Afterwards,

70
00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:30.560
we continued that work at the Lender Center for Mental Health and at a Senior Citizen Retirement

71
00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:38.880
Center. But sometime during the COVID pandemic when we all separated to our homes and online

72
00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:47.040
Zoom meetings, Carolyn's health started becoming troublesome. Our dear Yogini Shalini and Ram,

73
00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:52.640
as well as many others, took great care of Carolyn. But by early this year, it was obvious

74
00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:59.600
that the end was really near. In late April, as many of the yogis as possible met and meditated

75
00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:06.080
together and then trooped across town to her hotel room. Even then, Carolyn remembered everyone by

76
00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:11.680
name, went around the room saying lovely things to each of us before receiving a colorful

77
00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:18.400
photo showing our Cincinnati fireworks sparkling over the riverfront. It was signed on the back

78
00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:25.680
by all the yogis and she thanked us profusely. She said she would have it placed with her in her

79
00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:33.360
coffin as it was to be a green burial. As usual, she made an ordinary event take on a dignity

80
00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:41.280
and specialness that often happened effortlessly around Carolyn. At the urging of her children and

81
00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:46.720
she spent the last couple weeks of her life with them at her older sister's house on the east

82
00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:53.040
coast. She graciously shared those final days watching movies and receiving love from her kids,

83
00:09:53.040 --> 00:10:00.560
grandkids, and birth family too. We had all said our goodbyes but most appropriately when we were

84
00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:07.840
just coming up from Sasara or Pooja on Mother's Day, Sunday, May 8th, we received the word of her

85
00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:13.920
passing. I think I speak for all the Cincinnati Yogis when I say that we were honored to know

86
00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:21.040
Carolyn. She was a special friend to each of us as well. Her knowledge of Sahaja Yoga was deep

87
00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:30.080
and comforting and we all loved her dearly. We're also privileged today to have Svetlana

88
00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:37.040
Clete here with us and she has a few things she'd like to say about Srimadaji and then we have

89
00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:39.440
Hilary Thomas who wants to say a few things.

90
00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:52.000
Hello again, my name is Svetlana Clete. I got the realization in 1989

91
00:10:52.880 --> 00:11:00.800
in Leningrad, Saint Petersburg, when Srimadaji just started Sahaja Yoga

92
00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:11.680
and after Indian Yogis left, I was one of the first who led public programs there.

93
00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:27.840
I met Carolyn in 93 in Moscow on my wedding because my husband and I and Jack Clete

94
00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:38.480
and her Ukrainian husband were married on the same day, 93 November 15th.

95
00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:52.480
I just noticed how beautiful she was inside and outside, always dressed well, always have nice

96
00:11:53.120 --> 00:12:01.280
had nice jewelry. As a matter of fact, paying respect to her, I'm wearing her jewelry today

97
00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:14.320
and because I kind of feel it's like all vibrations because she was a great Yogini

98
00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:27.040
and when I was sick with cancer, I am well now. A few years back, I could not eat or drink

99
00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:38.080
through my mouth because of radiation damage and had nourishment only through intervene.

100
00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:48.960
Carolyn gave me a beautiful dress because she said, I want you to look beautiful

101
00:12:49.920 --> 00:13:02.880
and it's so sensitive from her, so sincere, her pure love like knowing that I am deprived from

102
00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:14.400
collectively enjoying food with Yogis but she wanted me to be part of the collective and looking

103
00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:27.520
beautiful and we went to the symphony together. When there was Realize America in Cincinnati,

104
00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:42.000
she took a great part in that and she was like super Lakshmi. She wore real plates and real

105
00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:54.640
silverware for the collective to enjoy together meals when they were coming and for foreign

106
00:13:55.600 --> 00:14:05.120
Yogis who came for that event to be together and collectively happy. And again, I still have that

107
00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:15.200
set and when Yogis come for the pooches or for some events in my house, I offer them

108
00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:29.280
and I feel that Carolyn is still with us and like ending my small memory,

109
00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:41.520
I can tell you, I started reading her book, it takes the mother after she just passed

110
00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:53.840
and I felt in every page her real presence and it brought Carolyn to my life again.

111
00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:57.840
Jai Shimataji.

112
00:14:57.840 --> 00:14:59.840
Jai Shimataji, thank you so much.

113
00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:11.200
Wonderful. I think we have Hillary Thomas who's written something that she wanted to

114
00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:16.000
share with us. Hillary? Great.

115
00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:24.720
Yes. Hello everybody. Thank you so much for giving us the chance to remember Dear Carolyn.

116
00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:30.000
I had to write things down because I knew I wouldn't remember it and I might get a bit

117
00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:37.280
emotional. When Carolyn moved to Cincinnati, I got to know her although I had seen her

118
00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:44.240
at events since the early 1980s. Her early years in Cincinnati was spent six months here

119
00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:50.080
and the rest of the time helping with the children's school at Kanujahari. I was always

120
00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:57.280
amazed that she could drive by herself the 10 and a half hours to Kanujahari in her trusty

121
00:15:57.280 --> 00:16:05.520
old blue Chevy. At poojas, Carolyn always sat on the ground, legs crossed and with a straight back.

122
00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:12.800
Most of us of the same age had already taken to chairs. Carolyn was always the first to volunteer

123
00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:19.120
for any Sahaja Yoga task. She would drive so far to meetings and would be the first to get up and

124
00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:27.120
work on new people. She was a completely dedicated Sahaja Yogi. When we would go away, she would take

125
00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:33.840
care of our house. She came regularly to check on it and water the plants. I always felt completely

126
00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:39.920
confident knowing that she would be there. She had those qualities of reliability and

127
00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:47.520
diligence which came from her love. When she became sick, we became her wheels with others

128
00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:54.560
when she was diagnosed with cancer. We were there with her when the doctor first told her.

129
00:16:55.280 --> 00:17:01.520
She didn't let herself be down and depressed about the cancer but immediately took

130
00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:09.120
a very optimistic approach. She went through two years of treatment, discomfort and pain.

131
00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:15.920
She never complained and said everything was for her spiritual betterment. I always remember that

132
00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:23.600
and say that many times in my life since she said that. The last time I saw her was in the hospital

133
00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:30.960
before her family took her to Maryland. She was joking with her mother and her family. She was

134
00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:38.560
joking and being positive as always. This was just one week before she passed. When the doctor came

135
00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:45.360
to discharge her, he said that it had been a privilege to take care of her. To me, it was also

136
00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:51.760
a privilege and a blessing to have known Carolyn. We love and miss you, Carolyn. Jai Shumataji.

137
00:17:51.760 --> 00:18:01.760
Oh, wonderful, Dilleri. I'm sure everyone is very happy to hear from you and to see you too,

138
00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:11.360
all your friends in Europe. So now I think if we can, we will move to Teresa Cody.

139
00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:19.600
She is at the Kannadjahari School and worked so much right next to Shumataji

140
00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:29.680
and with our dear Carolyn. So please, do we have Teresa?

141
00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:38.800
Yes, she's here. Yes. Jai Shumataji, everyone. Thank you for inviting me. I was doing the same

142
00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:43.040
thing yesterday. I was trying to remember when Auntie Carolyn started here and I believe it was

143
00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:50.400
in 2008 because it was before she moved to Cincinnati. One thing that I really remember

144
00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:57.840
about her, she was 70 when she started coming here to help. She had the energy of 10 people.

145
00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:02.640
Young people would be sitting down and seeing her work and we'd all look at each other,

146
00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:07.600
oh, we better get up. She's working so hard. We can't say we're tired.

147
00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:13.440
And she used to always say here that I'd say, oh, this is hard work. She goes, no, it's not.

148
00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:20.800
It's not hard work. It's not hard work at all. And we were, Anita's here, who's originally from

149
00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:26.720
Cincinnati too one time. And we were talking about how she was a warrior and that truly was what

150
00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:34.160
Auntie Carolyn was. There was no, no, it could be done. And one of the things that she helped us

151
00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:41.520
with the government is we were working on a religious visa and what they had wrote in there,

152
00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:47.520
she goes, they can't write that. That's racist. We have to fight this. So she got on our hat and

153
00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:54.240
we worked with our lawyer. It went down to Homeland Security and then they kept not doing

154
00:19:54.240 --> 00:20:00.880
their job. So she called our local Congress person and worked with them to finally get us

155
00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:10.320
this religious visa so that we could employ people from afar. But one thing she did with always,

156
00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:17.200
and we were talking about this last night, is there was always love. There was never any doubt

157
00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:25.600
in her mind of things that couldn't get done. And just how young, I think all the children made her

158
00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:31.200
here too, is like, she played with them so much. And she would always, I remember one time they,

159
00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:38.640
we have a tractor and they would go on a hayride and the trailer fell off and Uncle Russ couldn't

160
00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:44.800
get it back connected. And the grass was above their head. And she goes, come on, we can walk

161
00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:51.440
through this. And that's what she really likes teaching the children is don't give up. You can

162
00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:57.520
persevere through anything. And we had this big steep hill that we climb up by a Creek and

163
00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:02.800
she'd yell at the aunties, oh no, don't help them. Don't help them. They can do it. They can do it.

164
00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:10.080
Let them try. Let them try. If they can't, we'll assist, but let them try. So always, that's my

165
00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:18.320
memory of never giving up. There's always an answer. There was no stopping. And she

166
00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:25.600
worked here at the school for eight or nine years. So she was like in her late seventies when she

167
00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:33.120
finally said, I don't think I can do it anymore. And it's like auntie you've done so much,

168
00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:38.960
but she missed it every day that I would talk to her. She'll, I wish I was there. I wish I was

169
00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:47.840
there. She was such a light and a guiding force that I enjoyed so much. I think she really,

170
00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:55.120
when I became in this position, I had never managed people. I've never lived in an ashram.

171
00:21:55.680 --> 00:22:02.000
So with her guidance and all her years of knowledge from Shramadaji, from just being a

172
00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:10.960
manager at a bank, all these things helped me grow so much. I'm so indebted to her. She was

173
00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:17.120
definitely, I feel somebody that we've been together in a past life. Just there was so much

174
00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:24.400
joy that she always brought to the school. She's missed. I mean, I'm trying not to cry because she's

175
00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:37.280
a very great soul. Oh, thank you so much. It's really lovely. And, and you know, it's always

176
00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:43.760
been amazing to me how children loved Carolyn so much. I'm sure you saw that with her there.

177
00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:49.120
It just was amazing. Like she was always online with all of us, but when it was children,

178
00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:55.440
it was like a different matter. They were just like her little own children. Every child she

179
00:22:55.440 --> 00:23:02.080
met was like her own. And it was, it was really amazing to watch that. Thank you.

180
00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:13.920
So I think we have Sylvia, don't we, out in on the West coast. I think she wants to say a few words.

181
00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:16.560
We still have Sylvia Dooling.

182
00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:30.880
Oh, hi. Sorry. Hi. Hi Betty and everyone. Thank you so much for inviting me.

183
00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:38.720
I'm sorry. I'm not. There's a little delay. I think in the zoom, I'm in the car

184
00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:41.840
driving between Florida and Virginia.

185
00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:48.720
But we can hear you.

186
00:23:50.720 --> 00:24:00.160
Oh, great. Okay. So that's why I won't put my video because I think it will be just distracting.

187
00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:10.080
I'm sorry that I haven't.

188
00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:22.000
Carolyn, I mean, it just flows from the heart I think. So I'll just start with my realization

189
00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:28.880
in a library in Norfolk, Virginia, under the dear facilitation of Carolyn.

190
00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:42.480
And I remember that day, of course, so well. And I remember the way Carolyn produced everything

191
00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:51.200
made so much sense that I just thought, I can't wait to talk to this lady after the program,

192
00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:56.880
after the program, I nearly chased her and her husband, Belodia out of the library. I mean,

193
00:24:56.880 --> 00:25:04.320
I just wouldn't let them go. And finally, Carolyn said, just turn to me, you know how she was just

194
00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:09.600
full on about everything and full of love. And she just turned on me and turned to me and said,

195
00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:17.520
I would love to talk to you. Please give me your phone number. But my family's waiting at home.

196
00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:25.280
It's my birthday and they want to celebrate. It was almost like, oh my goodness, Carolyn is more

197
00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:31.920
interested in talking about yoga than letting her family celebrate her birthday. So that was

198
00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:38.960
my first introduction to Carolyn. But she was so wonderful. I almost followed up to her house.

199
00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:43.360
So then, for the next,

200
00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:56.240
especially, I felt like Carolyn's little child, honest to God. I was 48 years old and I had just

201
00:25:56.240 --> 00:26:04.800
had my rebirth. And this was my new mother, sister, everything was, our relationship was

202
00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:10.240
everything to me. We talked about three times a week. And when we weren't talking, I was

203
00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:14.640
remembering the smallest and most beautiful little things that she did.

204
00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:24.480
I certainly remember after about a year, she decided about a year after I'd been in

205
00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:30.400
the Haji, about a year and a half, we would have dinner at her house. It was always beautiful,

206
00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:37.600
with lovely china, which has been mentioned here and was done like a party, even though it was just

207
00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:45.280
Carolyn, her husband and myself. And we would listen to a talk and we would meditate.

208
00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:54.320
And in one talk, she reminded me that, you know, spread satchi yoga in the churches,

209
00:26:54.320 --> 00:27:03.440
talk to the ministers. So she decided that we would write to ministers. So we got out the

210
00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:11.920
phone book. This is 2001, 2002. And we selected three churches and one responded and it was a

211
00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:22.640
unity church in Virginia Beach, Virginia. We went there and Carolyn gave this minister,

212
00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:29.680
who was a lady, self-realization. And we had a program there for a year. Nobody came,

213
00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:33.920
but Carolyn decided, I mean, there were just like one or two people,

214
00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:42.080
one or two people, one or two people every night. I mean, once a week, but Carolyn decided that

215
00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:48.080
that would be a great learning experience for me. So after just being in the Haji,

216
00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:56.560
really about a year and a half, she had me giving programs and that was my real knowledge base.

217
00:27:57.520 --> 00:28:03.280
That's where I got my foundation because you never know how to know anything until you teach it.

218
00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:11.040
And I had to immerse myself and talk about a subject that was still new to me, but

219
00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:17.760
under Carolyn's tutelage and guidance and beaming, oh, that was a beautiful program.

220
00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:20.880
She would always tell me that even though I was falling on my face and

221
00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:31.600
blushing the whole time or whatever it was. So then she decided after, and I don't know why,

222
00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:41.840
but with Anna Mantini, perhaps it was Anna's great passion, she and Anna decided that we would go

223
00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:53.280
to the reservation at Pine Ridge in Pine Ridge, South Dakota, which is the Lakota reservation

224
00:28:53.920 --> 00:29:00.320
that Anna had contacted through an amazing series of events, which I hope Anna will tell us all one

225
00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:10.080
day. And I had never done anything like this before. I had never just had thought that I would

226
00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:15.680
take off from work and go to an Indian reservation and give self-realization,

227
00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:22.000
but it just didn't matter. If we were doing mother's work, everything would be fine. And

228
00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:28.400
we really didn't have space in our brain to worry about anything when Carolyn was involved because

229
00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:36.960
her enthusiasm, absolute devotion, absolute trust that if we were doing mother's work,

230
00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:44.240
everything would work out. Just overtook everything else. And you kind of were just

231
00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:50.880
thoughtless because you just didn't want to miss any of this amazing stuff sort of going on between,

232
00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:58.560
in a way, between of course us individually and humanity, but sort of that phase that you could

233
00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:06.880
see working through Carolyn and humanity. So we went there and we gave realization and people

234
00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:17.280
came from Colorado. Yogi's came, Alia Einstein and her new husband and Anna came and people came

235
00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:31.600
from Canada, Regina and Christina. So it became so collective and what an amazing thing to have

236
00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:37.600
happened when you're only in Sahaja Yoga for four years at that point.

237
00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:52.240
Well, I think we may have lost them. I know she's traveling.

238
00:30:52.240 --> 00:31:06.080
But they came and brought gifts to Sumanji and that was all Carolyn and Anna together,

239
00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:21.760
their amazing energy. So there are almost too many memories to recount, but for everyone

240
00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:30.800
has said so much here and it's just palpably true that any time you were in the presence of Carolyn,

241
00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:40.720
you just felt like Sahaja Yoga was, you maybe thought that Sahaja Yoga was the answer,

242
00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:46.480
but when you were with Carolyn, there was no doubt in your mind. This is the way we're going to save

243
00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:52.960
the world. So I hope I haven't run over time. I don't remember what my time allotment was,

244
00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:58.560
but I'll end there and just say thank you so much for the beautiful memories and beautiful vibrations

245
00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:14.080
today. Thank you so much for sharing with us. We are at about 3.30. I don't know if
