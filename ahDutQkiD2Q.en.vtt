00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:11.760
But naturally, spontaneously, as soon as you get your Realization and grow in it,

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:18.480
naturally you develop a very humble attitude.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:32.920
Also an attitude through which you achieve lots of qualities of your Guru.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.840
Now, supposing the Guru is at a particular height

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:43.520
and if you try to go on to the same height, nothing will move towards you.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:51.640
So you must sit at a place which is much lower than the Guru's is.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:57.440
Some people take too much advantage of My good nature, I should say,

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.200
and so many people have pointed out to Me that

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.720
"You must correct these people, they talk to You at equal level and all that."

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:08.520
I said: "They will learn a lesson, they will learn a lesson."

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.600
But sometimes, it doesn't work out and they start talking

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:19.200
on the same manner as if you are talking to your friend or to your equal.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.320
First is complete humility.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.920
You have to be a humble person, extremely humble.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:35.280
Now, you check on that, when you talk to others, are you humble?

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.800
When you think of others, are you humble?

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.920
When you look after your wife and children, are you humble?

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:57.080
That's a very important thing for every person who thinks he is a Guru.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:06.760
Humility is the first quality or, I should say, the ocean into which you must jump.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:12.560
Some people think that "If you are humble, Mother, then people will take advantage of you."

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:18.440
Nobody can take advantage of you, because you have to remember another point,

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:24.880
that you are protected all the time, looked after by Param Chaitanya.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.720
I know you know that, but how many really believe tha

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.880
t there is Param Chaitanya with us?

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:42.720
If you really believe that there is Param Chaitanya, then you don't get frightened,

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:51.320
you don't get worried, you are not subjected to all kinds of nonsensical ideas also.

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.400
On this day of Guru Puja, I have to say now

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:02.400
that one has to work very hard, very hard.

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:11.480
The most important thing is how much you have dedicated your life, your time to Sahaja Yoga.

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.200
Then only you will achieve that state of Guru.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:26.280
Look at Me, I'm a house wife and I have my family's responsibilities, problems, but despite that,

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:35.280
I'm all the time thinking about Sahaja Yogis, Sahaja Yoga and all that is this emancipation

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.360
of human beings in the whole world.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.720
Not only here or there, in the whole world.

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:56.600
So, that should be your widened vision, not for only your school, college, or university, your this or that

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.640
but a very wider vision one should have and that you have to develop

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:08.480
through your working into every type of circumstances,

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:13.360
every type of problems you have.

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.760
Once you develop that kind of a personality,

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.320
then you'll be amazed how you can help so many people.

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:27.600
I know there are so many Sahaja Yogis here who are worthy of praise

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:34.120
and really I love them very much and they also love Me very much,

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:42.120
but one should always see that, as you are now going to be the Gurus,

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:47.160
you have to be careful not to think that you are a Guru.

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:51.160
You should never think you are a guru already.

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:56.960
Once you start thinking again Mr. Ego, the guru, comes up.

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:08.160
So, once you decide that "I'm nothing, I'm nothing, I'm just a little ripple in the heart of my Mother."

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:16.480
If such a humble feeling you get, then, all your problems can be solved and things will work out.

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:23.280
Because your attention and your behavior is going to impress other people, nothing else.

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:31.120
Whatever you may try, it is you who is going to get Sahaja Yoga further.
