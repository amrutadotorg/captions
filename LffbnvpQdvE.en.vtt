Final draft: Transcription of Shri Mataji’s
talk:

00:14.270 --> 00:15.270
SAHASRARA PUJA
4 MAY 1997

00:15.270 --> 00:16.270
CABELLA

00:16.270 --> 00:25.099
Today we all have assembled here to worship
the Sahasrara.

00:25.099 --> 00:46.810
As you have realised that Sahasrara is a very
important part of the subtle system.

00:46.810 --> 01:01.949
Of course this is a great day in 1970 that
this Chakra was opened up, but by that what

01:01.949 --> 01:06.100
you have achieved we have to see it.

01:06.100 --> 01:25.899
First of all when the Kundalini rises She
goes to your Void where is your dharma, and

01:25.899 --> 01:37.260
your dharma gets established at the Nahbi
Chakra, we can say, around the Nabhi Chakra.

01:37.260 --> 01:46.149
Your dharma gets established which is the
innate Pure Universal Religion.

01:46.149 --> 01:48.850
It’s established.

01:48.850 --> 01:54.270
But then the Kundalini rises higher.

01:54.270 --> 02:04.790
Despite the establishment of the dharma we
start becoming little bit aloof from other

02:04.790 --> 02:12.630
societies because we find they are amiss,
they have no dharma.

02:12.630 --> 02:19.030
Also, I think we are afraid that we might
get caught up with their adharmas.

02:19.030 --> 02:29.480
So, at that stage we don’t want to cross
the limits of Sahaja Yoga, want to keep to

02:29.480 --> 02:37.300
Sahaja Yogis, to Sahaja Yoga programme, and
to our personal Sahaj life.

02:37.300 --> 02:48.140
Of course, it is important because first this
Chakra must be fully nourished, and this Chakra

02:48.140 --> 02:54.599
is actually moves around the Nahbi Chakra
which we know as Swadisthana.

02:54.599 --> 03:05.090
This Swadishtan Chakra is in a way very important
because it supplies energy to the brain.

03:05.090 --> 03:18.540
So when dharma is established the subtle energy
pushes through the Kundalini more energy for

03:18.540 --> 03:32.319
the Sahasrara, and also the energy for dharma
which was in the Sahasrara, the Swadistana

03:32.319 --> 03:34.790
also starts flowing with it.

03:34.790 --> 03:44.930
It crosses over and starts rising in the Sahasrara.

03:44.930 --> 03:55.290
Till then we are, I would say, we are not
yet full Sahaja Yogis because one can become

03:55.290 --> 03:58.180
fanatic about Sahaja Yoga.

03:58.180 --> 04:05.500
I have seen people who are so fanatic that
they cannot even meet people who are not Sahaja

04:05.500 --> 04:12.090
Yogis, they cannot even talk to people who
are not Sahaja Yogis, and all the time they

04:12.090 --> 04:18.080
are frightened of meeting people who are not
Sahaja Yogis.

04:18.080 --> 04:24.340
Of course you need not meet people who are
evil, people who are against Sahaja Yoga,

04:24.340 --> 04:32.699
who talk against it, but those who are seeking
the truth, it is our duty that we have to

04:32.699 --> 04:35.180
go to them.

04:35.180 --> 04:47.180
So when it reaches the state where it is established
in the brain, that time we go beyond dharma.

04:47.180 --> 04:51.500
Dharmateet - we become beyond.

04:51.500 --> 04:59.910
Dharma means that dharma becomes part and
parcel of our being, we cannot lose it.

04:59.910 --> 05:10.210
Sahaj dharma becomes within us a part and
parcel which is a very great achievement because

05:10.210 --> 05:16.360
then you don’t have to do any rituals, you
don’t have to worry about meeting other

05:16.360 --> 05:26.830
people, you don’t have to worry that your
vibrations will be harmed.

05:26.830 --> 05:36.889
Then you don’t catch from anyone, you don’t
catch also other negative forces.

05:36.889 --> 05:40.590
No one can harm you.

05:40.590 --> 05:46.830
That I call as the completion of your Shradha.

05:46.830 --> 05:56.930
That time Sahasrara is so fully englightened
that you become dharma.

05:56.930 --> 06:05.000
For example, we can give the example of Christ.

06:05.000 --> 06:09.449
Christ saw a protistute being stoned.

06:09.449 --> 06:13.210
Now Christ had nothing to do with the prositute,
I mean just the opposite of it.

06:13.210 --> 06:25.430
But when He saw she was stoned He took a stone
in His hand, and He says that those who think

06:25.430 --> 06:31.710
who have not sinned at all can throw a stone
at Me.

06:31.710 --> 06:40.380
And everyone was standing: Why is He taking
the side of a protistute.

06:40.380 --> 06:42.860
He is a religious man.

06:42.860 --> 06:47.640
He should also put stones on her.

06:47.640 --> 06:50.940
But He was standing on truth.

06:50.940 --> 06:58.449
That’s exactly what happens to you when
it is established in Sahasrara, in Sahasrara,

06:58.449 --> 07:00.370
that you stand on truth.

07:00.370 --> 07:10.740
There's a little difference in the, I would
say, in dharma and in truth.

07:10.740 --> 07:20.000
A dharma person might become too dharmic,
illogically dharmic and go to the right or

07:20.000 --> 07:21.950
to the left.

07:21.950 --> 07:33.349
A dharmic person might think he is the superior
person to others: that why should he be trying

07:33.349 --> 07:38.389
to save anybody else, let them go to hell,
who cares.

07:38.389 --> 07:43.690
This kind of an attitude can come in a person
who is dharmic.

07:43.690 --> 07:50.880
Also I have seen some Sahaja Yogis who start
new methods in Sahaja Yoga.

07:50.880 --> 07:55.789
You do like this it will be alright, you do
like that it will be alright, because they

07:55.789 --> 08:01.880
are not stagnated at the point of dharma,
so they start telling people that you do this

08:01.880 --> 08:03.759
way do that way.

08:03.759 --> 08:10.750
But when you rise to the point of truth, then
you don’t do any rituals, you don’t need

08:10.750 --> 08:21.580
any rituals, you are not bothered, because
you are in dharma and here you are standing

08:21.580 --> 08:27.080
on the truth, and truth is much greater than
dharma.

08:27.080 --> 08:38.979
For example, a person who is standing on truth
- he doesn’t care for any absurd ideas about

08:38.979 --> 08:42.979
religion even about Sahaj religion.

08:42.979 --> 08:50.910
He doesn’t care that after all this is Sahaj
this is not Sahaj, he goes beyond.

08:50.910 --> 08:54.910
In the sense he sees a global truth within
himself.

08:54.910 --> 09:04.510
He sees the truth which is all pervading,
not only sees but he knows and he feels and

09:04.510 --> 09:09.120
he is in that truth.

09:09.120 --> 09:17.120
So when dharma flowers into truth it’s a
very beautiful happening and that should happen

09:17.120 --> 09:21.160
to all of you.

09:21.160 --> 09:26.950
So many things can linger on if you are only
on the dharma level.

09:26.950 --> 09:34.040
I have seen people going into ego, making
money.

09:34.040 --> 09:39.190
Sometimes they don’t even ask me and go
on doing things which they should not do.

09:39.190 --> 09:44.360
They do wrong things which are not good for
Sahaja Yoga.

09:44.360 --> 09:55.380
There is no humility about it and they don’t
understand that whether this dharma is standing

09:55.380 --> 09:58.650
on truth or untruth.

09:58.650 --> 10:04.980
So we have to go to the foundation of dharma
which is truth.

10:04.980 --> 10:12.320
As described before it’s a tree of life
which has got its roots in the brain and the

10:12.320 --> 10:14.620
branches in the body.

10:14.620 --> 10:21.610
So you have to go to the roots of everything
and that is the place where you reach when

10:21.610 --> 10:25.450
you are absolutely established in Sahasrara.

10:25.450 --> 10:39.310
In the Sahasrara are the roots of all these
ideas we have, or we can say, all these swarupas

10:39.310 --> 10:42.560
we have taken.

10:42.560 --> 10:45.450
We have now become dharmic.

10:45.450 --> 10:47.980
What is the root of dharma?

10:47.980 --> 10:53.400
Why should we be dharmic?

10:53.400 --> 10:54.820
What is the need to be dharmic?

10:54.820 --> 11:00.280
There are many people in this world who are
extremely adharmic living very well.

11:00.280 --> 11:06.350
According to, I mean, outward expression we
feel that they are very happy people, they

11:06.350 --> 11:14.430
are alright they are enjoying themselves while
we are deprived perhaps of all the so-called

11:14.430 --> 11:17.950
enjoyments of these people.

11:17.950 --> 11:29.830
So at the state of only dharma things become
very important to us which are, may not be

11:29.830 --> 11:31.900
standing on truth.

11:31.900 --> 11:38.250
There are so many things like that I can point
it out to you that how Sahaja Yogis faulter,

11:38.250 --> 11:42.080
even after acheiving dharma state they faulter.

11:42.080 --> 11:55.350
I have seen people giving up their drugs,
alcoholism, giving up other kinds of addictions,

11:55.350 --> 11:57.300
even their language improves.

11:57.300 --> 12:08.040
And their, we can say, behaviour is changed,
they become humbler people no doubt, but still

12:08.040 --> 12:13.210
they are conscious that they are standing
on dharma.

12:13.210 --> 12:18.370
This consciousness has to disappear.

12:18.370 --> 12:37.190
At the state of Sahasrara this consciousness
disappears because truth is love and love

12:37.190 --> 12:39.810
is truth.

12:39.810 --> 12:46.460
That is the point where the Kundalini meets
the Heart Chakra.

12:46.460 --> 12:50.480
As you know the pita of heart is here.

12:50.480 --> 12:59.640
So when Kundalini pierces through that Heart
Chakra, what starts flowing in the brain,

12:59.640 --> 13:06.170
in the Sahasrara is the truth, but truth that
is love.

13:06.170 --> 13:14.460
There’s a difference between truth as itself
and truth that is love.

13:14.460 --> 13:20.430
So out of love for that prostitute that Christ
stood by her.

13:20.430 --> 13:31.730
He stood on the roots of truth no doubt, but
what was flowing through His heart was the

13:31.730 --> 13:35.320
love, the pure love.

13:35.320 --> 13:44.060
So now when we have pure love for someone,
we see the whole thing in a different manner,

13:44.060 --> 13:52.520
we see a person in a different manner and
it becomes very sweet.

13:52.520 --> 14:06.760
Otherwise truth can be very bitter, can be
very painful, but truth which is adorned with

14:06.760 --> 14:11.690
love is just like a flower without the thorns.

14:11.690 --> 14:23.720
It’s very interesting how a person who is
pouring with love and is standing on truth

14:23.720 --> 14:29.160
- that’s the personality you have to become.

14:29.160 --> 14:37.940
Now in the expression of love we can take
an example to understand.

14:37.940 --> 14:44.830
Supposing I meet somebody and he is telling
all kinds of horrible things about another

14:44.830 --> 14:48.200
person.

14:48.200 --> 14:55.160
So I feel tremendous love for him as well
as for the person whom he is telling all these

14:55.160 --> 14:56.160
things.

14:56.160 --> 15:07.360
So now I take to lie, a complete lie, which
is a truth, also in a way.

15:07.360 --> 15:11.540
I tell that person, see what are you talking.

15:11.540 --> 15:17.520
The person about whom you are saying all this
had been just praising you all the time and

15:17.520 --> 15:20.250
here you are talking like this.

15:20.250 --> 15:29.130
Now this is not the truth actually, but you
take the help of the lie, the other side of

15:29.130 --> 15:36.180
the truth, to bring out a friendship between
the two persons.

15:36.180 --> 15:45.480
So this is what is the work of love, that
it tries to bring people closer to each other:

15:45.480 --> 15:55.630
to say things by which they become one, united.

15:55.630 --> 16:03.250
So all the divisive methods that we have used
so far just disappear and we try to understand

16:03.250 --> 16:14.490
what is the method by which we can join people’s
heart.

16:14.490 --> 16:21.191
As it is you are in collective consciousness,
but this collective consciousness, if it is

16:21.191 --> 16:31.570
supericial you can achieve great results like
as you have done it - maybe you can build

16:31.570 --> 16:36.810
beautiful ashrams, you can do all this.

16:36.810 --> 16:47.410
But when it is filled with love, collective
consciousness, then the joy is complete of

16:47.410 --> 16:51.670
collective consciousness.

16:51.670 --> 16:55.000
Now people talk of peace.

16:55.000 --> 17:01.410
You cannot have peace without this new awareness
we call it collective consciousness, but in

17:01.410 --> 17:12.709
that also there has to be the main tattwa,
principle of love.

17:12.709 --> 17:24.290
For example now, Sahaja Yogis say from Germany
and Austria are going to Israel - it is very

17:24.290 --> 17:25.290
fulfilling.

17:25.290 --> 17:35.360
I was happy that they have chosen for this
Puja people from Israel, and then I found

17:35.360 --> 17:44.920
Israelies coming to Egypt forgetting all that
Muslims had done to them.

17:44.920 --> 17:54.090
It’s really remarkable how people get attracted
towards expression of their love, to their

17:54.090 --> 18:02.800
fellow men, to other Sahaja Yogis, and once
it starts growing you will be surprised how

18:02.800 --> 18:05.910
we can change this world.

18:05.910 --> 18:17.310
Most of the problems, human problems, are
due to hatred and is very commonly used - I

18:17.310 --> 18:23.510
hate, I hate, it’s absurdity, it’s a sin
to hate someone.

18:23.510 --> 18:26.740
Why do you hate someone.

18:26.740 --> 18:33.470
You can hate the sin, you can hate the evil,
but you should not hate people just for hating

18:33.470 --> 18:34.920
sake.

18:34.920 --> 18:42.390
This hatred that we have is responsible for
all the problems we have had so far.

18:42.390 --> 18:49.930
Because one person becomes very powerful,
by dividing people he becomes very powerful,

18:49.930 --> 18:56.450
and these divisive things have really crushed
so many countries.

18:56.450 --> 19:05.880
For example our country was divided by the
British, now they are having the division.

19:05.880 --> 19:09.320
This doesn’t stop.

19:09.320 --> 19:11.510
By dividing us what has happened?

19:11.510 --> 19:17.490
All the countries who have gone away from
India are suffering very much.

19:17.490 --> 19:23.390
Those people who tried to divide the country
thought that they’d become prime ministers,

19:23.390 --> 19:24.660
this that.

19:24.660 --> 19:29.250
Most of them have been murdered by their own
people.

19:29.250 --> 19:33.140
You can see clearly how hatred manifests itself.

19:33.140 --> 19:42.780
It starts from a small point and it manifests
all over, very clearly it can be seen in any

19:42.780 --> 19:45.060
country being divided.

19:45.060 --> 19:54.160
There’s no need to divide any country - that
creates more hatred and more trouble.

19:54.160 --> 20:05.190
In the same way in Sahaja Yoga we should not
think of have divisions.

20:05.190 --> 20:13.730
Now we have got a beautiful land – as that
you must have heard about near to Ganges.

20:13.730 --> 20:22.390
Now people are thinking if they can have separate
houses, separate compounds.

20:22.390 --> 20:26.130
Why?

20:26.130 --> 20:31.870
You know how to live collectively, you enjoy
collective life, so why do you want to have

20:31.870 --> 20:35.030
separate houses?

20:35.030 --> 20:37.790
What secrets are we going to have from each
other?

20:37.790 --> 20:47.160
After all whatever we do is known on the vibrations
- you cannot hide anything, so why have separate

20:47.160 --> 20:48.260
houses.

20:48.260 --> 20:55.070
Why do you want to have some privacy, because
in Sahaja Yoga there is no privacy.

20:55.070 --> 21:03.780
We know about everyone, what are they up to,
what are their problems, what chakras they

21:03.780 --> 21:04.850
are catching.

21:04.850 --> 21:05.930
Isn’t it?

21:05.930 --> 21:10.160
So there is no secret about anything in Sahaja
Yoga.

21:10.160 --> 21:16.590
Everyone knows about everyone, so what’s
the use of having privacy - also I can’t

21:16.590 --> 21:17.590
understand.

21:17.590 --> 21:25.130
It’s like this you see still the mind is
working like that.

21:25.130 --> 21:28.820
Then they are thinking of inheritance.

21:28.820 --> 21:37.740
Alright, I was saying that you can have inheritance,
but if your son is not a Sahaja Yogi, what

21:37.740 --> 21:38.740
to do.

21:38.740 --> 21:46.660
We cannot keep a culprit there to trouble
everyone.

21:46.660 --> 21:55.290
It is not the rules and regulations that are
going to keep you happy and joined together,

21:55.290 --> 22:01.870
but it is the pure collective consciousness
and its love.

22:01.870 --> 22:09.660
Because as you know we have no proper organisations,
we have no clergyship, we have nothing like

22:09.660 --> 22:10.660
that.

22:10.660 --> 22:16.350
Leaders also can shift more times than Ganges
River can shift its course.

22:16.350 --> 22:17.840
So there is nothing like that.

22:17.840 --> 22:24.270
It’s all on a shifty sand we are standing,
all the time, and your Mother is another one

22:24.270 --> 22:27.610
who tries all kinds of tricks.

22:27.610 --> 22:40.330
The reason is I want you to stand on rocks
and this rock is emitting love, is emitting

22:40.330 --> 22:52.260
that Divine Love, and the joy of that love
is really so beautiful.

22:52.260 --> 22:58.590
For example, people would like to have their
separate bathrooms, specially Indians, suddenly

22:58.590 --> 23:03.690
they have become Britishers and Britishers
have become Indians you know.

23:03.690 --> 23:10.150
Indians want to have their separate bathrooms
- I don’t know why, and uh, this is a very

23:10.150 --> 23:12.700
common disease with Indians.

23:12.700 --> 23:18.560
And it is also spreading to other people I
feel sometimes that they want to have their

23:18.560 --> 23:21.420
separate bathrooms.

23:21.420 --> 23:24.030
In a collective life there is no need.

23:24.030 --> 23:31.040
You don’t even know, if you ask me I won’t
even know if I have been to bathroom or not,

23:31.040 --> 23:33.500
just go there come back, finished.

23:33.500 --> 23:38.960
I have no time for all that.

23:38.960 --> 23:48.770
In the same way you also should have a concept
of a society which is living like a ocean,

23:48.770 --> 23:53.580
if ocean rises they rise, it falls they fall
- just one [unison?

23:53.580 --> 23:54.580
union?

23:54.580 --> 23:56.530
Sounds like "unigon"] of Love.

23:56.530 --> 24:06.800
I am expecting that kind of a society at the
foothill of Himalayas, and I am sure you all

24:06.800 --> 24:13.950
of you realise that Himalaya being the Sahasrara
of the world.

24:13.950 --> 24:22.590
Luckily I wanted it to be done before the
Sahasrara Puja and it is done, with the blessings

24:22.590 --> 24:25.200
of Himalayas I should say.

24:25.200 --> 24:33.250
The Himalaya is also like the Sahasrara where
the Kundalini has risen, where the vibrations

24:33.250 --> 24:38.370
have come out, and in the sky you can see
the vibrations.

24:38.370 --> 24:49.800
But this Himalaya is ruled by a wrathful God
called Shiva - that’s the dangerous part

24:49.800 --> 24:51.620
of it.

24:51.620 --> 24:56.180
So we have to be very, very careful.

24:56.180 --> 25:11.330
If we try to play around, if we try to
take to hatred among ourselves, take to divisive

25:11.330 --> 25:21.930
methods, take to something that is not Sahaj,
this wrathful God is sitting on our head.

25:21.930 --> 25:28.220
He’s also in Mecca, this is Mecaisha Shiv
there.

25:28.220 --> 25:33.840
If you try to misbehave he comes out with
his wrathfulness.

25:33.840 --> 25:40.530
Anywhere where you are you have to be very
careful that this Shiva is everywhere.

25:40.530 --> 25:53.281
Like one of these Lingas of Shiva is in [Perlybaithnath?],
that is in Maharastra, Alahathur, and there

25:53.281 --> 26:01.210
people started another kind of Sahaja Yoga,
also they were drinking on the day of the

26:01.210 --> 26:15.530
Shri Ganesha’s celebrations, so the wrath
of Shivalinga came and there was such a big,

26:15.530 --> 26:18.250
huge earthquake.

26:18.250 --> 26:28.520
Many people were lost but none of the Sahaja
Yogis, and their centre was saved completely.

26:28.520 --> 26:35.280
Now we had a big fire also as you know last
time and nothing happened to you, you are

26:35.280 --> 26:36.620
under protection.

26:36.620 --> 26:39.590
You are all the time protected.

26:39.590 --> 26:45.700
There was no wrath of Shiva that could work
out anything.

26:45.700 --> 26:49.420
Fire could not do anything to you because
you are under protection.

26:49.420 --> 26:54.300
But this protection is your Mother’s love.

26:54.300 --> 27:01.140
It’s not anything else but the love of your
Mother, which is very powerful, and which

27:01.140 --> 27:04.370
is protecting you and helping you.

27:04.370 --> 27:11.559
In the same way you develop that kind of love
for others, for other Sahaja Yogis, for other

27:11.559 --> 27:17.000
people, for other things, for this Mother
earth, for all that.

27:17.000 --> 27:24.940
Your love can not only protect you but protect
others also.

27:24.940 --> 27:31.320
Your attention as long as it is on yourself
will start becoming smaller and smaller.

27:31.320 --> 27:36.810
I should have this, I should have that, I
like this, I like that.

27:36.810 --> 27:40.070
All these topics will fall.

27:40.070 --> 27:45.240
You’ll never say ‘I like this’.

27:45.240 --> 27:47.500
No question.

27:47.500 --> 27:48.570
What do I like?

27:48.570 --> 27:57.200
It is difficult for me to decide if I like
anything - this I like, that I like, I like

27:57.200 --> 27:59.120
to be this way.

27:59.120 --> 28:00.160
Who are you?

28:00.160 --> 28:03.650
Ask yourself the question.

28:03.650 --> 28:06.200
Who are you?

28:06.200 --> 28:16.200
If you are the pure spirit it is nothing but
love, and in love you think of others, the

28:16.200 --> 28:23.470
problems of others, you try to make others
comfortable, you try to look after others

28:23.470 --> 28:28.920
and you don’t just look after yourself and
bother about yourself.

28:28.920 --> 28:31.020
This is what you have to reach.

28:31.020 --> 28:36.980
Though you may be dharmic, you may be in every
way Sahaj, but still, unless and until you

28:36.980 --> 28:46.410
reach that state in your Sahasrara, I wouldn’t
say that you are alright.

28:46.410 --> 28:48.270
You have to work it out.

28:48.270 --> 28:55.800
For that, of course, meditation is very important,
but the thing that stops it is your mind.

28:55.800 --> 28:59.600
It's your mind that goes on telling you.

28:59.600 --> 29:03.640
All the time you watch your mind how it tries
to guide you.

29:03.640 --> 29:11.080
How it tries to tell you - now what about
me, what about my house, what about my children,

29:11.080 --> 29:14.350
what about my country.

29:14.350 --> 29:20.660
Like that you go on ‘my, my, my, my, my’
- ultimately you end up into nothing.

29:20.660 --> 29:27.530
But when you say ‘you, you, you’ - Kabira
has said a beautiful thing about it.

29:27.530 --> 29:37.980
He says that when the goat is living it is
saying: ‘Meh, meh, meh’ which means I,

29:37.980 --> 29:39.330
I, I.

29:39.330 --> 29:48.309
But it dies, then they take out the intestine
and put in on a dunkih, where they put it

29:48.309 --> 29:52.380
for the cleaning of the cotton.

29:52.380 --> 29:59.059
And that time what does that dunkih say: ‘Tuhi,
tuhi, tuhi’ - you are the one, you are,

29:59.059 --> 30:05.110
you are, you are - and that he calls all over.

30:05.110 --> 30:10.380
In the same way you have to think from other’s
point of view.

30:10.380 --> 30:17.950
First of all tuhi when you say, you say it
to your Guru or to God that you are - I am

30:17.950 --> 30:24.870
no more, I am dissolved, I am finished, I
have become one with this ocean of love.

30:24.870 --> 30:34.630
And then you say to others: ‘you are, you
are’ that is Sahaj Culture.

30:34.630 --> 30:43.480
See, so lots of falsehood will follow - falsehood
that surrenders you and others.

30:43.480 --> 30:52.080
Like people try falsehood by saying something
‘I love you very much’ and on the back

30:52.080 --> 30:55.050
they plan something very bad.

30:55.050 --> 30:57.809
They can do anything.

30:57.809 --> 31:02.320
Not Sahaja Yogis they don’t do it, I must
say, that they have reached the stage where

31:02.320 --> 31:03.810
they don’t do it.

31:03.810 --> 31:07.920
But still if they don’t do it they are conscious
of it.

31:07.920 --> 31:15.800
All the time they are conscious, we don’t
do this, we don’t drink - so what, we don’t

31:15.800 --> 31:17.410
fuss about food.

31:17.410 --> 31:24.140
I mean all their things they have achieved
they are very proud of it, you see very proud

31:24.140 --> 31:27.390
- that we are like this, we are that.

31:27.390 --> 31:34.940
You see, because you are the pure spirit,
because you are that, so you have become that.

31:34.940 --> 31:39.120
How can you take pride in something what you
are?

31:39.120 --> 31:44.200
Like somebody asked me: don’t you feel very
proud that you are the Adi Shakti?

31:44.200 --> 31:47.950
I said ‘What?’

31:47.950 --> 31:49.840
I couldn’t understand the question.

31:49.840 --> 31:55.611
I said see now, if I am Adi Shakti what is
there to be proud, because I am that, what

31:55.611 --> 31:57.250
is there to be proud?

31:57.250 --> 32:03.300
If I was not that then I would be proud of
it, but I was, so what is there to be proud

32:03.300 --> 32:04.370
of.

32:04.370 --> 32:11.900
Like the sun, it shines, it’s not proud
that ‘I am the sun’, or if you are born,

32:11.900 --> 32:20.880
say, with your eyes and nose, a face like
a human being, you are not proud: I'm a human

32:20.880 --> 32:24.270
being, I'm a human being - are you proud?

32:24.270 --> 32:33.049
In the same way if you are that what you are,
you are not proud, you are not conscious of

32:33.049 --> 32:36.250
it, not at all conscious.

32:36.250 --> 32:40.170
I mean, I never tell myself I am Adi Shakti,
there’s no need to tell.

32:40.170 --> 32:41.770
But it is so, what to do.

32:41.770 --> 32:47.320
Now God has chosen me, I should say, to be
Adi Shakti, alright, I can have it.

32:47.320 --> 32:53.100
But I just don’t know what is there - as
if like some people think that, Sahaja Yoga

32:53.100 --> 33:00.280
has been bestowed upon them like some Lordship
or something like that.

33:00.280 --> 33:09.970
It is what you have become - when you become,
you must understand that you have become that.

33:09.970 --> 33:19.809
Like supposing a stone becomes gold, then
it is gold, it won’t be proud that ‘I’m

33:19.809 --> 33:20.809
gold’ - gold is gold.

33:20.809 --> 33:24.130
Why will it be proud of that?

33:24.130 --> 33:33.500
In the same way this consciousness of being
a Sahaja Yogi drops off.

33:33.500 --> 33:40.020
Still it lingers - so one has to be careful
that once you are a Sahaja Yogi, you are a

33:40.020 --> 33:41.660
Sahaja Yogi - so what.

33:41.660 --> 33:46.590
I am a Sahaji , so what, nothing so great.

33:46.590 --> 33:53.480
It’s like saying that I have a nose, you
see, and be proud of saying I have a nose.

33:53.480 --> 33:59.179
Nose is already there, what is there to be
proud of - But this pride has to go.

33:59.179 --> 34:07.059
That’s very important to realise that I’m
not there, I’m no more - I’m one of the

34:07.059 --> 34:14.179
whole - become the ocean this drop of mine
- I don’t know if there are any boundaries

34:14.179 --> 34:15.730
left in me.

34:15.730 --> 34:22.110
This kind of consciousness develops in you,
when your consciousness is filled with joy

34:22.110 --> 34:28.780
- just with joy and bubbling with love - bubbling
with love.

34:28.780 --> 34:39.649
You go on see expressing your love, whether
you talk or you don’t talk, whether you

34:39.649 --> 34:49.960
say about it or you don’t, whether you are
smiling or not, this joy is in your heart.

34:49.960 --> 35:03.710
Now the Heart Chakra here, the pita of the
Heart Chakra, gets filled with light of truth,

35:03.710 --> 35:11.960
but the truth is not such an absurd thing
that we know of as truth is.

35:11.960 --> 35:15.520
For somebody asked me what is the truth.

35:15.520 --> 35:25.510
So I said that it was written long time back,
that you should speak the truth and speak

35:25.510 --> 35:32.650
something that people will like - Satjamvadeth
priyamvadeth.

35:32.650 --> 35:36.530
Then people said, how can you make this truth.

35:36.530 --> 35:44.580
Truth may not be palatable and could be something
that you say which people like, and may be

35:44.580 --> 35:49.100
false, so how to make these two things meet.

35:49.100 --> 35:58.260
So Krishna gave a very good answer, He said
it’s like this: Satyamvadeth, hitamvadeth,

35:58.260 --> 35:59.260
primamvadeth.

35:59.260 --> 36:06.820
You say the truth, truth you must say, but
that truth should be good, or should be liked

36:06.820 --> 36:15.430
or should be appreciated or should be nourishing
for your spirit, by which there is benevolence

36:15.430 --> 36:21.950
which creates benevolence, and then it has
to be priya.

36:21.950 --> 36:28.420
In the beginning, people may not like and
say that ‘he said horrible things to me’

36:28.420 --> 36:36.550
or whatever it is - but at the end of it he’ll
say that see, it’s so good that this was

36:36.550 --> 36:40.520
said to me that I have done something perfect.

36:40.520 --> 36:48.210
But in any case there is no need to say something
very harsh or hard to anyone.

36:48.210 --> 36:54.340
That is not your job to go on correcting all
the rest of the people.

36:54.340 --> 36:59.100
To begin with, many Sahaja Yogis, I have seen,
have been saying: you’ve got this chakra

36:59.100 --> 37:01.300
caught up, you’ve got that chakra caught
up.

37:01.300 --> 37:05.010
All this is the play of ego.

37:05.010 --> 37:10.070
You have no business to condemn anyone, you
have come from such a condemned condition

37:10.070 --> 37:13.300
yourself, so why are you condemning others.

37:13.300 --> 37:20.540
Only thing is if you are capable, if you are
equipped, if you are matured enough in Sahaja

37:20.540 --> 37:28.730
Yoga, then you will just take it up as a great
challenge of love and you will do it.

37:28.730 --> 37:33.171
But you won’t go on condemning that person,
finding faults with that person, it’s a

37:33.171 --> 37:37.900
very good excuse if you don’t want to do
it.

37:37.900 --> 37:43.880
Supposing somebody is sick and the doctor
doesn’t know how to cure, so what does he

37:43.880 --> 37:44.880
do?

37:44.880 --> 37:50.690
He says you see you are sick because this
happened, because you went in the cold.

37:50.690 --> 37:56.490
Because this haribaba yes, but now I am sick
so now what about curing me.

37:56.490 --> 38:01.610
No, because you did this, because you did
that, you should not have done this.

38:01.610 --> 38:04.510
All about the past mistakes, he’ll go on.

38:04.510 --> 38:11.220
In the same way we go on: that you did like
this, you were like this, you went to the

38:11.220 --> 38:16.470
falara guru, you did this kind of a mistake,
that’s why you are like this.

38:16.470 --> 38:21.450
No, don’t tell him anything, just work it
out and it works.

38:21.450 --> 38:28.109
Of course, you can ask if he has been to some
guru, but don’t condemn, don’t criticise,

38:28.109 --> 38:34.020
there is no need to condemn anybody for what
mistakes they have committed.

38:34.020 --> 38:39.280
This is all coming from the consciousness
that you are better equipped, that you have

38:39.280 --> 38:40.730
all the knowledge.

38:40.730 --> 38:47.220
You have, you are very knowledge people, I
must say very knowledgable.

38:47.220 --> 38:56.820
You are the gnostics, all that I accept, but
as long as you are aware of it you are not.

38:56.820 --> 39:05.440
Once you are not aware of it then you are
that what is called Sahaja Yogi.

39:05.440 --> 39:12.270
So I would expect all of you to have this
new development in their Sahasrara, in your

39:12.270 --> 39:15.300
Sahasrara, in everybody’s Sahasrara.

39:15.300 --> 39:17.200
We have to think of the whole world.

39:17.200 --> 39:21.251
We cannot just think of Sahaja Yogis and also
about the seekers.

39:21.251 --> 39:25.841
Seekers are there, alright, but what about
the rest.

39:25.841 --> 39:29.890
There are so many problems there and so many
things are to be done.

39:29.890 --> 39:35.430
For example, now we have a problem in India
of poverty.

39:35.430 --> 39:38.220
So I am trying to do something for them.

39:38.220 --> 39:41.100
You have problems in your countries.

39:41.100 --> 39:44.080
You should find out what problems there are.

39:44.080 --> 39:50.609
You can start some sort of a movement for
them, try to help them as far as possible.

39:50.609 --> 39:57.490
It’s not missionary like, that you convert
somebody for some sort of a reward or for

39:57.490 --> 40:03.050
some name you have to do - you just do it
for your pleasure, because it’s your pleasure

40:03.050 --> 40:04.200
to do it.

40:04.200 --> 40:09.030
That’s how you'll go to the society and
you won’t be afraid that you'll be caught

40:09.030 --> 40:10.030
up.

40:10.030 --> 40:15.609
I know of one couple, when I asked them, why
don’t you start working it out.

40:15.609 --> 40:18.700
So they said ‘Mother we are afraid our ego
will come back’.

40:18.700 --> 40:23.610
They are afraid of themselves only - their
ego will come back.

40:23.610 --> 40:30.080
So all these problems should be dropped out
and you should reach that state where you

40:30.080 --> 40:36.450
don’t have all these fears, all these non-sensical
ideas about yourself.

40:36.450 --> 40:38.560
You are powerful.

40:38.560 --> 40:40.570
You have powers.

40:40.570 --> 40:44.440
Not only that, but you have been specially
bestowed with those powers.

40:44.440 --> 40:48.070
But if you don’t want use it then what are
you?

40:48.070 --> 40:55.800
If the lamp is not enlightened what is this
lamp for - just for decoration?

40:55.800 --> 41:02.599
So this has to be used, and this has to be
used without feeling that awareness within

41:02.599 --> 41:09.680
you that you are something great, better than
others, something selected, or also they say

41:09.680 --> 41:13.570
that we are chosen.

41:13.570 --> 41:20.690
So, this can spread very fast with such grace
and understanding.

41:20.690 --> 41:25.850
All kinds of stupid people are there, it’s
alright, you know they are stupid - just laugh

41:25.850 --> 41:30.800
at them, make fun of them and that’s how
you can solve the problem.

41:30.800 --> 41:37.180
But even that, you should do it in such a
way that you don’t hurt them, that whatever

41:37.180 --> 41:42.270
you do you should see from the results what
works out.

41:42.270 --> 41:54.470
Results should be such that you should see,
how it works out.

41:54.470 --> 41:58.960
With some people - that’s the intelligence,
I think that’s the superior intelligence

41:58.960 --> 42:05.640
by which you know how to say things, what
to say things and how to work it out.

42:05.640 --> 42:15.970
Love, this Divine Love, gives you a complete
control over yourself, and you know everything,

42:15.970 --> 42:22.130
how to behave, how to talk to people, how
to manage them.

42:22.130 --> 42:30.080
I don’t know what is the worst thing among
human beings.

42:30.080 --> 42:40.570
According to Krishna it was temper - hot temper
was the worst thing, but according to me it

42:40.570 --> 42:44.770
is jealousy.

42:44.770 --> 42:51.460
Jealousy of any kind is absolutely, I should
say, like a scum.

42:51.460 --> 42:59.790
In Sahaja Yoga also people feel jealous and
they may not say so because I don’t like

42:59.790 --> 43:07.630
it, but they may create problem, they may
try to create problem among each other.

43:07.630 --> 43:13.980
So one thing you should have a watch on your
mind if there is any kind of jealousy.

43:13.980 --> 43:21.510
I’m rather worried sometimes - supposing
I want to give some present to some people,

43:21.510 --> 43:28.560
then I’m worried that I shouldn’t do something
that will create jealousy.

43:28.560 --> 43:32.560
We should not.

43:32.560 --> 43:39.540
Mother might have forgotten, or it’s alright
she’s running short of it - it’s alright.

43:39.540 --> 43:47.220
But people have that kind of a very sharp
sense of jealousy when in Sahaja Yoga.

43:47.220 --> 43:52.990
Now supposing I meet somebody and I don’t
meet somebody else - finished.

43:52.990 --> 43:58.250
That person developes a jealousy for that
person whom I meet.

43:58.250 --> 44:02.170
Sometimes people pester me too much - ‘Mother,
I must meet you, I must meet you’.

44:02.170 --> 44:04.920
I don’t know why, why do you want to meet
me.

44:04.920 --> 44:10.520
I’m all over, everywhere as you say.

44:10.520 --> 44:16.050
Then what is the need that you should meet
me and talk to me - what is the need?

44:16.050 --> 44:23.580
It’s not for you alone I am, I’m for everyone,
but some people think that they have a special

44:23.580 --> 44:30.950
right on me and they think that I must meet
them indivdually, otherwise they feel very

44:30.950 --> 44:31.950
bad.

44:31.950 --> 44:39.790
All these things have to go away in a big
way when you become as I said, the ocean.

44:39.790 --> 44:47.080
Then you are not bothered what shore you go,
where you travel, you are not bothered, you

44:47.080 --> 44:51.090
are only with the ocean moving up and down.

44:51.090 --> 44:59.560
That is how it’s a living ocean of love,
and that’s what we have to develop it- without

44:59.560 --> 45:06.080
dominating others, without showing off.

45:06.080 --> 45:14.090
It should be, the whole thing should be contented
within ourself.

45:14.090 --> 45:23.210
In Hindi it is said better: Apneme ...(hindi...ndt).

45:23.210 --> 45:32.160
Should be all within yourself and that’s
the most enjoyable thing.

45:32.160 --> 45:40.740
Because see what we want, supposing I want
something for myself, you see, so I’ll strive

45:40.740 --> 45:42.220
and get it.

45:42.220 --> 45:52.090
But this is something if you have within yourself,
you fully filled within yourself.

45:52.090 --> 45:57.130
So what is most important, what is so much
needed?

45:57.130 --> 45:58.920
Nothing!

45:58.920 --> 46:12.300
You are completely filled with yourself, contented
with yourself, and then you want to share.

46:12.300 --> 46:21.940
This is the ideal way of dealing with Sahasrara,
I think, and I am sure the day will come this

46:21.940 --> 46:28.520
whole world’s Sahasrara has to be opened
out.

46:28.520 --> 46:34.810
This is what we have to do it, and we are
not going to disappear into some exclusive

46:34.810 --> 46:43.200
places that is just for meditation - you can
go there, but not for escaping the world.

46:43.200 --> 46:44.760
That is not the idea.

46:44.760 --> 46:52.770
Idea is for meditation, for your growth - it
would be a nice place to go to.

46:52.770 --> 47:09.470
It is very important to understand how valuable
you are, how remarkably important you are

47:09.470 --> 47:18.440
- born at this time, got your realisation
for what?

47:18.440 --> 47:29.599
To emancipate this world, to transform human
beings, to take whole of this world into the

47:29.599 --> 47:31.170
realm of God.

47:31.170 --> 47:32.540
That is what you are here for.

47:32.540 --> 47:33.540
May God bless you.
