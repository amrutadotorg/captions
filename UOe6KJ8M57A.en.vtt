WEBVTT

00:04.110 --> 00:14.039
Today we are really sitting in very close
relationship with the nature.

00:14.039 --> 00:22.300
The whole thing, as you can see very clearly,
is done by villagers and in a very simple

00:22.300 --> 00:42.030
way and I’m sure you must all be enjoy-ing
it very much.

00:42.030 --> 00:52.780
Today being the first puja in Maha-rastra,
we have to do Ganesha Puja, but one has to

00:52.780 --> 01:04.150
understand how it is so impor-tant in Maharastra
that people worship Ganesha.

01:04.150 --> 01:16.420
As you know there are … eight Ganeshas are
there around this area and this triangle of

01:16.420 --> 01:26.520
Maharastra which has got on one side one big
mountain.

01:26.520 --> 01:33.380
On the other side we have another mountain
which, of course, is not in Maharastra.

01:33.380 --> 01:35.549
And also on top we have another moun-tain.

01:35.549 --> 01:46.210
So like a triangle which is made like a Mooladhara
means the Kundalini itself.

01:46.210 --> 01:49.900
So the Ku ndalini of the whole world resides
in this area.

01:49.900 --> 01:57.000
That’s why it is called, we should say,
as Maharastra, as the country which is very

01:57.000 --> 01:59.650
great, the nation which is very great.

01:59.650 --> 02:11.090
But I don’t know how far Maharastrans realize
that they are sitting in the land of Maharastra.

02:11.090 --> 02:26.940
This land which is vibrated by Shri Ganesha
has its own simplicity, has its own vibrations,

02:26.940 --> 02:32.840
a different style, a differ-ent type.

02:32.840 --> 02:44.250
The best part of Maharastra is that it gives
you a very good attention.

02:44.250 --> 02:56.379
With Ganesha so much vibrating, the attention
becomes very concentrated and this concentration

02:56.379 --> 03:06.230
helps you in so many ways and that is why
it is said that Ganesha was created to spread

03:06.230 --> 03:13.190
or to emit auspiciousness and holiness.

03:13.190 --> 03:17.950
Actually, if there is holiness there is auspiciousness.

03:17.950 --> 03:30.269
For Ganesha is t he one actually who cleanses
everything, cleanses everything because it

03:30.269 --> 03:38.430
is innocence and the innocence that cleanses
you takes away all kinds of conditionings

03:38.430 --> 03:44.159
and egos that are distracting your attention.

03:44.159 --> 03:51.780
So the attention which is so wobbly otherwise
in other places can settle down very well

03:51.780 --> 04:00.920
in Maharastra because of Shri Ganesha’s
blessings that this country has, that people

04:00.920 --> 04:04.730
have very good attention.

04:04.730 --> 04:13.350
With that good attention you can really do
so many things like now, for example, you

04:13.350 --> 04:16.010
can see the software.

04:16.010 --> 04:17.329
Good mathematics.

04:17.329 --> 04:25.580
They’re very good at music because all these
things require tremendous attention.

04:25.580 --> 04:35.779
Art, dancing, anything which requires tremendous
attention, that has to come only through Ganesha.

04:35.779 --> 04:39.930
Because they say Ganesha is a giver of wisdom.

04:39.930 --> 04:42.990
He’s a giver of wisdom.

04:42.990 --> 04:48.430
Means just His wisdom becomes just a dharma,
becomes a part and parcel of your being.

04:48.430 --> 04:50.300
You become just wise.

04:50.300 --> 04:52.659
Now somebody may ask, ÒMother how to become
wise.

04:52.659 --> 04:56.050
It’s very difficult to say how to become
wise.

04:56.050 --> 04:59.810
It is just that it happens that you become
wise.

04:59.810 --> 05:03.339
So, though He’s a child, He’s so matured.

05:03.339 --> 05:05.240
He’s so wise.

05:05.240 --> 05:17.919
And He’s not only that, but He emits wisdom
and this wisdom is an in-nate quality of anyone

05:17.919 --> 05:24.039
who is a Sahaja Yogi because in him, also,
Shri Ganesha has been awakened.

05:24.039 --> 05:31.800
So he becomes a wise person, very wise, and
with wisdom what does he achieve? He achieves

05:31.800 --> 05:42.960
a balance, a proper ascent and also he understands
that this ascent is for his benevolence, for

05:42.960 --> 05:46.749
the benevolence of his country, benevolence
of the whole world.

05:46.749 --> 05:49.819
He understands the importance of Sahaja Yoga.

05:49.819 --> 05:53.270
Without this wisdom, one cannot understand.

05:53.270 --> 06:02.870
And this wisdom is within us, just absolutely,
in-nately built in.

06:02.870 --> 06:09.490
Only thing is we have to use the storehouse
of this wisdom that is within us.

06:09.490 --> 06:14.919
Of course, with Sahaja Yoga, it starts emitting
and you start feeling and you start understanding

06:14.919 --> 06:16.379
what this wisdom is.

06:16.379 --> 06:19.649
You give up all your stupid, childish things.

06:19.649 --> 06:22.949
You give up all your attachments.

06:22.949 --> 06:28.689
You give up many of your, say, things that
you don’t like which doesn’t behove you.

06:28.689 --> 06:32.090
You feel that you should give up, but you
cannot.

06:32.090 --> 06:38.080
But, with Sahaja Yoga, it just hap-pens automatically
and you just see in your light what is needed,

06:38.080 --> 06:39.569
what is not needed.

06:39.569 --> 06:42.380
In that wisdom you throw away whatever is
wrong.

06:42.380 --> 06:49.330
So that a great work this Ganesha has to do
within ourselves.

06:49.330 --> 06:55.659
This manifes-tation of Ganesha within us is
very important, I think, not that it is only

06:55.659 --> 07:02.550
the blessings, but also the foundation stone
of spiritual life is Shri Ganesha.

07:02.550 --> 07:10.460
That’s why IÔve been very anxious that
we should find out proper schools for our

07:10.460 --> 07:11.460
children.

07:11.460 --> 07:15.650
They should have proper education and t Ëhey
should be looked after because their Ganesh

07:15.650 --> 07:17.210
Tattwa is already there.

07:17.210 --> 07:22.300
Only thing we have to nourish it, we have
to look after it and make it grow.

07:22.300 --> 07:25.449
Once that happens then children are safe.

07:25.449 --> 07:28.309
Then nothing, nothing can harm them.

07:28.309 --> 07:31.330
Nothing they will absorb which is wrong.

07:31.330 --> 07:35.460
They will never be again in the wrong path.

07:35.460 --> 07:41.689
But if from early childhood, you did not have
this kind of training or this kind of understanding

07:41.689 --> 07:49.759
about Kundalini or about wisdom part of it,
you can never, later on, easily assimilate

07:49.759 --> 07:50.759
it.

07:50.759 --> 07:58.479
For that, you really require a great effort
and understanding that you have to have this.

07:58.479 --> 08:00.759
It’s so beauti-ful.

08:00.759 --> 08:06.110
You must get this attention and you must get
this innocence within.

08:06.110 --> 08:12.139
With Sahaja Yoga, as you see, it’s working
out very fast and people are getting, really,

08:12.139 --> 08:17.809
very wise and I can see the wisdom writ large
on their faces.

08:17.809 --> 08:29.159
In this wisdom what do we find here? You see,
on any line that we move, we can find that

08:29.159 --> 08:38.370
most of our problems are coming from human
beings because ecological problem, or any

08:38.370 --> 08:43.030
problem we think of, comes from human beings.

08:43.030 --> 08:48.759
Or other programs that you have in your own
country, as you have seen, that they are such

08:48.759 --> 08:53.650
problems that it’s sort of endless and they
cannot change them.

08:53.650 --> 08:59.079
You feel very nice sitting underneath this
because you are fed up … that you have and

08:59.079 --> 09:07.730
the prob-lems that it causes to you and the
way it is now becoming very artificial.

09:07.730 --> 09:19.610
But in these circumstances, one has to understand
that the… wisdom plays such a part in life

09:19.610 --> 09:26.089
that whatever may happen outside, whatever
may be the trend, whatever may be the fashion,

09:26.089 --> 09:31.230
whatever maybe the people are all changing
into, you do not change.

09:31.230 --> 09:32.920
You change within.

09:32.920 --> 09:41.870
Once you are changed within, then you have
full idea as to what is expected o f others,

09:41.870 --> 09:48.620
what they should do, what you are doing and
how to deal with them and how to talk to them,

09:48.620 --> 09:52.930
how to tell them, how far to go with them
– everything.

09:52.930 --> 09:58.970
All this comes through wisdom.
In Sahaja Yoga, as you know, you are very

09:58.970 --> 10:04.459
capable people, you have achieved a lot, you
know everything, you know all about chakras.

10:04.459 --> 10:06.209
You know practically everything.

10:06.209 --> 10:08.689
I don’t have to tell you anything.

10:08.689 --> 10:15.189
Despite all that, one should have also the
wisdom how to deal with others, how to talk

10:15.189 --> 10:25.110
to others, how to behave towards others, how
not to control anyone, not to say something

10:25.110 --> 10:28.410
that would be rather harsh or hurting.

10:28.410 --> 10:36.050
Because, if you are trying to spread Sahaja
Yoga, this is the only way we can go forward,

10:36.050 --> 10:40.009
is to look after everyone with great compassion.

10:40.009 --> 10:50.459
Now, we might think that wisdom is there with
us and we know how to do so many things with

10:50.459 --> 10:54.529
our wisdom and now we are absolutely wise.

10:54.529 --> 10:59.800
Agree, with Sahaja Yogis, now they have become
really very, very wise and they know how to

10:59.800 --> 11:05.540
use their wisdom.
But still, faith in themselves really has

11:05.540 --> 11:09.569
to be of the Nirvikalpa state.

11:09.569 --> 11:14.209
That is only possible also through Shri Ganesha
because He is in Nirvikalpa.

11:14.209 --> 11:17.040
He has Nirvikalpas, nothing.

11:17.040 --> 11:19.430
He doesn’t have to question anything.

11:19.430 --> 11:21.829
He doesn’t have to ask for anything.

11:21.829 --> 11:23.610
He is just there.

11:23.610 --> 11:26.379
And He’s in complete Nirvikalpa.

11:26.379 --> 11:35.899
Complete, absolutely into a state where He
is not at all attached, nor is He worrying

11:35.899 --> 11:38.089
about things, nothing of the kind.

11:38.089 --> 11:43.060
He is just in Nirvikalpa and in that Nirvikalpa
He worships Mother.

11:43.060 --> 11:51.379
Small, small stories can show He how you were
so sure of Hims }elf, how He had courage and

11:51.379 --> 11:57.830
how He worked out everything so intelligently.

11:57.830 --> 12:02.360
But when you are doing something, you can
be in two minds.

12:02.360 --> 12:09.800
You can be not so decisive, but He was and
He is, always very decisive that He knows

12:09.800 --> 12:13.009
what is to be done like the – this is the
point.

12:13.009 --> 12:15.730
So, in wisdom you don’t have to think, argue.

12:15.730 --> 12:21.240
I’ve seen many people who say, Mother, you
see, we were thinking, then we had vibrations.

12:21.240 --> 12:28.600
We didn’t know what to do, this, that, how
to do, how to correct, how to work it out.

12:28.600 --> 12:32.579
Now, I must say this is a state.

12:32.579 --> 12:37.870
It is not a state to be achieved, but it’s
a state.

12:37.870 --> 12:39.129
Means you are there.

12:39.129 --> 12:45.279
It has to be innately built in yourself, this
state of wisdom.

12:45.279 --> 12:54.819
But you can also work it out by just concentrating
on yourself and trying to find out Òwhat’s

12:54.819 --> 13:00.350
the matter with me, what happens, why, why
is it I’m like this.

13:00.350 --> 13:07.220
The introspection can help you a lot to be
extremely wise, but Ø easier method is to

13:07.220 --> 13:15.440
worship the principle of innocence within
yourself.

13:15.440 --> 13:24.670
For example now, we are dealing with, supposing,
somebody who is a thief, say.

13:24.670 --> 13:26.910
He’s a thief now.

13:26.910 --> 13:29.769
What should you do with a thief.

13:29.769 --> 13:35.750
After you have found out whatever was lost,
the material you had, after that, what are

13:35.750 --> 13:42.290
you to do is just to forget about it completely.

13:42.290 --> 13:48.959
Once it has happened, then you have to just
forget, not to worry about it too much, Oh,

13:48.959 --> 13:56.459
this has happened, that has happened and how
to make this point all right and this gentleman

13:56.459 --> 13:57.459
is not all right.

13:57.459 --> 13:58.459
This, that.

13:58.459 --> 14:06.089
Just forget it.
So the wisdom is also in forgiving.

14:06.089 --> 14:10.069
That why Christ talked about forgiveness?
Just forgive.

14:10.069 --> 14:13.499
There’s no sense in remembering.

14:13.499 --> 14:16.990
This person said so, this person did so, that
happened so.

14:16.990 --> 14:22.160
Just forget it and once you start forgetting
all these things, you know, you’ll remember

14:22.160 --> 14:25.870
right things and useless things you’ll just
forget.

14:25.870 --> 14:32.519
You don’t remember who has insulted you,
who has troubled you, who has be íen misbehaving.

14:32.519 --> 14:36.709
I don’t even think about people who have
gone out of Sahaja Yoga, talking ill about

14:36.709 --> 14:38.660
Me, saying things, this, that.

14:38.660 --> 14:39.829
It’s all right.

14:39.829 --> 14:43.420
Let them say whatever they like, I am not
bothered.

14:43.420 --> 14:47.559
But what bothers Me more, that if they do
like this, I don’t know what will happen

14:47.559 --> 14:48.649
to them.

14:48.649 --> 14:54.161
That’s the only wisdom part of it, that,
you see, when I forgive everyone I … forgive.

14:54.161 --> 14:56.790
I have nothing to say.

14:56.790 --> 15:01.770
But then also a thought comes in, that if
they’re doing like this, then what’s going

15:01.770 --> 15:03.550
to happen to them.

15:03.550 --> 15:11.680
They’re doing this to some one who’s so
good, who’s so religious, so highly placed

15:11.680 --> 15:13.670
in spiritual life.

15:13.670 --> 15:18.930
Then you can’t play about but somebody’s
playing, then what you have to do is to really

15:18.930 --> 15:25.160
forgive because one thing is built-in in Sahaja
Yoga that who tries to trouble you they will

15:25.160 --> 15:28.949
be trouble also.
So try to forgive at least, at least you soothe

15:28.949 --> 15:29.949
them down.

15:29.949 --> 15:31.290
All right, I forgive you.

15:31.290 --> 15:33.890
So soothe them down.

15:33.890 --> 15:40.019
Like this kind of a wisdom you should have,
not to get after people, not to pester some

15:40.019 --> 15:51.680
one, not to be very strict, not to be very
sort of – I should say – pursue the matter.

15:51.680 --> 15:56.110
Whatever is it, that point you should finish
off and just don’t worry.

15:56.110 --> 16:00.860
I was telling just now that there is a servant,
supposing.

16:00.860 --> 16:03.300
Now, he steals your money, all the time.

16:03.300 --> 16:05.749
You know he steals your money.

16:05.749 --> 16:10.209
Now what to do if he’s stealing your money?
One thing is to get out, to ask him to get

16:10.209 --> 16:11.209
out.

16:11.209 --> 16:12.329
Then you have another one.

16:12.329 --> 16:14.939
Then again you get him out and get another
one.

16:14.939 --> 16:21.670
Go on like that because they’re poor people….
Now even if you’re careful, still they might

16:21.670 --> 16:27.569
steal, so what you should do is just to forgive
the person and put the money in such a place

16:27.569 --> 16:29.670
that he cannot reach.

16:29.670 --> 16:31.200
Finished.

16:31.200 --> 16:32.649
As simple as this.

16:32.649 --> 16:37.329
You should just find out what doe s he steal.

16:37.329 --> 16:39.070
Oh, that’s all.

16:39.070 --> 16:45.839
Then you keep it one side.
But don’t worry about all the time that,

16:45.839 --> 16:52.560
Now, how am I to save myself from this thief
or how am I to punish him? Just don’t think.

16:52.560 --> 16:57.879
These incidents are just like a breeze coming
any way.

16:57.879 --> 17:00.370
These relationships are just like that.

17:00.370 --> 17:02.009
There’s no depth in it.

17:02.009 --> 17:10.059
They’re not going to bring any kind of unhappiness
or happiness, whatever it is, if you go on

17:10.059 --> 17:15.380
lingering about them.
So, the first thing is live in the present.

17:15.380 --> 17:18.400
The wisdom is in living in the present.

17:18.400 --> 17:22.029
Present, we are here, so forget the past.

17:22.029 --> 17:27.409
Now, if I say forget the past, then they say,
How to do it? How to forget the past.

17:27.409 --> 17:31.539
Again, I would say, meditation is the only
way.

17:31.539 --> 17:37.640
You give up your left and you give up your
right and you are just standing in th e centre,

17:37.640 --> 17:44.159
enjoying the wisdom, enjoying the joy of your
being.

17:44.159 --> 17:54.960
So, the best part of our lives is spent in
bothering, in getting upset, in getting worried,

17:54.960 --> 17:59.279
getting after some one.

17:59.279 --> 18:04.669
Where is the time? Just think like that.

18:04.669 --> 18:10.299
Now supposing some one says something to Me
and then others will say, Mother, you must

18:10.299 --> 18:11.299
do something about it.

18:11.299 --> 18:12.909
You must punish that person.

18:12.909 --> 18:22.720
Where is the time? We have to awaken the kundalini
of thousands and thousands and thousands and

18:22.720 --> 18:30.970
here we are just worried about something nonsensical.
So our wisdom is finished.

18:30.970 --> 18:35.390
We have no wisdom at all.

18:35.390 --> 18:39.480
Even at the highest level you can see people
don’t have wisdom.

18:39.480 --> 18:53.809
Highest level of realization I’ve seen people
who do not have wisdom in the sense that

18:53.809 --> 19:00.700
they want to run away, they just get fed up,
take sanyasa, finished, go to Himalayas, live

19:00.700 --> 19:01.700
there happily.

19:01.700 --> 19:04.340
There’s no wisdom in that also.

19:04.340 --> 19:09.630
So living in the present you don’t also
feel tired because you don’t think of the

19:09.630 --> 19:16.220
past and the future and you live very well
and in great happiness, you improve things

19:16.220 --> 19:21.399
and you don’t think of the future, what
is going to happen to me or anything and that’s

19:21.399 --> 19:29.090
how you save lot of troubles of others, as
well as yours.

19:29.090 --> 19:39.530
So this wisdom is to live in the present,
is now that you ask somebody, How are you?

19:39.530 --> 19:40.820
All right.

19:40.820 --> 19:44.140
And he’s not in the present.

19:44.140 --> 19:50.240
You ask somebody, Are you enjoying yourself?
Not in the present.

19:50.240 --> 19:55.730
You ask somebody, Are you happy? No.

19:55.730 --> 19:58.750
Then you are not in the present.

19:58.750 --> 20:06.440
You ask some one that, Are you hungry? Maybe,
may not be.

20:06.440 --> 20:12.340
Maybe they don’t know even in the present
if they are hungry or not.

20:12.340 --> 20:17.480
It’s so much that they’re lost in the
past and in the future, that’s the sign

20:17.480 --> 20:20.030
of unwise behavior, unwise line.

20:20.030 --> 20:26.000
If they don’t know whether they’d like
to have their food or not.

20:26.000 --> 20:31.880
But those who are really in the present forget
all these small, small things.

20:31.880 --> 20:36.470
They’re just in the present and in the present
whatever they have to do, they just do it.

20:36.470 --> 20:39.470
This is a very good practice.

20:39.470 --> 20:44.840
One has to to practice wisdom through living
in the present.

20:44.840 --> 20:48.710
Just say, What am I to do right now? What
am I to do.

20:48.710 --> 20:53.110
Like you’re getting out of the house.

20:53.110 --> 20:57.730
Many people leave half way – Oh, my God,
I have left my passport.

20:57.730 --> 20:59.690
They’ll go back.

20:59.690 --> 21:02.210
Then again, some time they will come out.

21:02.210 --> 21:04.170
My God, I have left my spectacles.

21:04.170 --> 21:05.800
Again go back.

21:05.800 --> 21:08.820
Then again they will come back and say, I
have lost this.

21:08.820 --> 21:09.890
I should have this.

21:09.890 --> 21:13.040
These kind of people are very, very common.

21:13.040 --> 21:17.890
So at that style when you are leaving the
house, say, at that time, if you’re in the

21:17.890 --> 21:23.820
present, then you just think, What have I
to take? Just say, One, two, three, four,

21:23.820 --> 21:24.820
five.

21:24.820 --> 21:28.419
Yes, this is is what I have to take and this
there.

21:28.419 --> 21:38.429
That’s how you can really establish yourself
in wisdom, itself, means the wisdom acts by

21:38.429 --> 21:39.429
itself.

21:39.429 --> 21:41.010
It’s a power.

21:41.010 --> 21:42.279
Wisdom is a very big power.

21:42.279 --> 21:45.650
If you are a wise person, it’s a power.

21:45.650 --> 21:51.899
It can combat any kind of ignorance, any kind
of attacks, any kind of stupidity.

21:51.899 --> 21:59.130
It’s such a tremendous power that one has
given us that we are wise and this wisdom

21:59.130 --> 22:07.570
you should try to really, to develop it and
mature it properly within ourselves.

22:07.570 --> 22:10.940
So today’s Shri Ganesha’s Puja is there.

22:10.940 --> 22:16.170
Now you should ask for wisdom and for that
we have to be in the present.

22:16.170 --> 22:20.169
Every way we should be in the present.

22:20.169 --> 22:27.070
If you can try, you can be because your kundalini
has been awakened and you can be all the time

22:27.070 --> 22:35.320
in the present, but today you should first
try and get the kundalini established in the

22:35.320 --> 22:36.930
present.

22:36.940 --> 22:40.360
May God bless you.
