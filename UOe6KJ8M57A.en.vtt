WEBVTT

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:14.039
Today we are really sitting in very close
relationship with the nature.

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:22.300
The whole thing, as you can see very clearly,
is done by villagers and in a very simple

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:42.030
way and I’m sure you must all be enjoying
it very much.

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:52.780
Today being the first puja in Maharashtra,
we'll have to do Ganesha Puja, but one has to

00:00:52.780 --> 00:01:04.150
understand how it is so impor-tant in Maharashtra
that people worship Ganesha.

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:16.420
As you know there are Ashtavinayakas, eight Ganeshas are
there around this area and this triangle of

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:26.520
Maharashtra which has got on one side one big
mountain,

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:33.380
on the other side, we have another mountain
which, of course, is not in Maharashtra.

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.549
And also, on top, we have another mountain.

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:46.210
So, like a triangle which is made like a Mooladhara,
means the Kundalini itself.

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.900
So, the Kundalini of the whole world resides
in this area.

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:57.000
That’s why it is called, we should say,
as Maharashtra, as the country which is very

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.650
great, the nation which is very great.

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:11.090
But I don’t know how far Maharashtrans realize
that they are sitting in the land of Maharashtra.

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:26.940
This land which is vibrated by Shri Ganesha
has its own simplicity, has its own vibrations,

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:32.840
a different style, a different type.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:44.250
The best part of Maharashtra is that it gives
you a very good attention.

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:56.379
With Ganesha so much vibrating, the attention
becomes very concentrated and this concentration

00:02:56.379 --> 00:03:06.230
helps you in so many ways. And that is why
it is said that Ganesha was created to spread

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:13.190
or to emit auspiciousness and holiness.

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.950
Actually, if there is holiness there is auspiciousness.

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:30.269
For Ganesha is actually the one who cleanses
everything, cleanses everything because it

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:38.430
is innocence. And the innocence that cleanses
you takes away all kinds of conditionings

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:44.159
and egos that are distracting your attention.

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:51.780
So, the attention which is so wobbly otherwise,
in other places, can settle down very well

00:03:51.780 --> 00:04:00.920
in Maharashtra. Because of Shri Ganesha’s
blessings that this country has, that people

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.730
have very good attention.

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:13.350
With that good attention, they can really do
so many things. Like now, for example, you

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:16.010
can see the software,

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:17.329
good mathematics.

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:25.580
They’re very good at music because all these
things require tremendous attention.

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:35.779
Art, dancing, anything which requires tremendous
attention, that has to come only through Ganesha.

00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:39.930
Because they say Ganesha is a giver of wisdom.

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.990
He’s a giver of wisdom.

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:48.430
means just wisdom becomes a dharma,
becomes a part and parcel of your being.

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:50.300
You become just wise.

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.659
Now somebody may ask, "Mother how to become
wise?"

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:56.050
It’s very difficult to say how to become
wise.

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.810
It is just that it happens that you become
wise.

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.339
So, though He’s a child, He’s so matured.

00:05:03.339 --> 00:05:05.240
He’s so wise.

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:17.919
And He’s not only that, but He emits wisdom
and this wisdom is an in-nate quality of anyone

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:24.039
who is a Sahaja Yogi. Because in him, also,
Shri Ganesha has been awakened.

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:31.800
So, he becomes a wise person, very wise, and
with wisdom what does he achieve? He achieves

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:42.960
a balance, a proper ascent and also he understands
that this ascent is for his benevolence, for

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.749
the benevolence of his country, benevolence
of the whole world.

00:05:46.749 --> 00:05:49.819
He understands the importance of Sahaja Yoga.

00:05:49.819 --> 00:05:53.270
Without this wisdom, one cannot understand.

00:05:53.270 --> 00:06:02.870
And this wisdom is within us, just absolutely,
innately built-in.

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:09.490
Only thing is, we have to use the storehouse
of this wisdom that is within us.

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:14.919
Of course, with Sahaja Yoga, it starts emitting
and you start feeling and you start understanding

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:16.379
what is wisdom is.

00:06:16.379 --> 00:06:19.649
You give up all your stupid, childish things.

00:06:19.649 --> 00:06:22.949
You give up all your attachments.

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:28.689
You give up many of your, say, things that
you don’t like which doesn’t behove you.

00:06:28.689 --> 00:06:32.090
You feel that you should give up, but you
cannot.

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:38.080
But, with Sahaja Yoga, it just happens automatically
and you just see in your light what is needed,

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:39.569
what is not needed.

00:06:39.569 --> 00:06:42.380
In that wisdom, you throw away whatever is
wrong.

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:49.330
So, that a great work this Ganesha has to do
within ourselves!

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:55.659
This manifestation of Ganesha within us is
very important, I think. Not that it is only

00:06:55.659 --> 00:07:02.540
the basis, but also the foundation stone
of spiritual life is Shri Ganesha.

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:11.460
That’s why I have been very anxious that
we should find out proper schools for our children.

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:15.650
They should have proper education and t Ëhey
should be looked after because their Ganesh

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:17.210
Tattwa is already there.

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:22.300
Only thing we have to nourish it, we have
to look after it and make it grow.

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:25.449
Once that happens then children are safe.

00:07:25.449 --> 00:07:28.309
Then nothing, nothing can harm them.

00:07:28.309 --> 00:07:31.330
Nothing they will absorb which is wrong.

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:35.460
They will never be again in the wrong path.

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:41.689
But from early childhood, if you never had
this kind of training or this kind of understanding

00:07:41.689 --> 00:07:50.729
about Kundalini or about the wisdom part of it,
you can never, later on, easily assimilate it.

00:07:50.759 --> 00:07:58.479
For that, you really require a great effort
and understanding that you have to have this.

00:07:58.479 --> 00:08:00.759
It’s so beauti-ful.

00:08:00.759 --> 00:08:06.110
You must get this attention and you must get
this innocence within.

00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:12.139
With Sahaja Yoga, as you see, it’s working
out very fast and people are getting, really,

00:08:12.139 --> 00:08:17.809
very wise and I can see the wisdom written large
on their faces.

00:08:17.809 --> 00:08:29.159
In this wisdom, what do we find here? You see,
on any line that we move, we can find that

00:08:29.159 --> 00:08:38.370
most of our problems are coming from human
beings. Because ecological problem, or any

00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:43.030
problem we think of, comes from human beings.

00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:48.759
Or other problems that you have in your own
country, as you have seen, that they are such

00:08:48.759 --> 00:08:53.650
problems that it’s sort of endless and you
cannot change them.

00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:59.079
You feel very nice sitting underneath this,
because you are fed up with the same ways that you have and

00:08:59.079 --> 00:09:07.730
the problems that it causes to you and the
way it is now becoming very artificial.

00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:19.610
But in these circumstances, one has to understand
that the wisdom plays such a part in life,

00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:26.089
that whatever may happen outside, whatever
may be the trend, whatever may be the fashion,

00:09:26.089 --> 00:09:31.230
whatever maybe the people are all changing
into, you do not change.

00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:32.920
You change within.

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:41.870
Once you are changed within, then you have
full idea as to what is expected of others,

00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:48.620
what they should do, what you are doing and
how to deal with them and how to talk to them,

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:52.930
how to tell them, how far to go with them
– everything.

00:09:52.930 --> 00:09:58.970
All this comes through wisdom.
In Sahaja Yoga, as you know, you are very

00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:04.459
capable people, you have achieved a lot, you
know everything, you know all about chakras.

00:10:04.459 --> 00:10:06.209
You know practically everything.

00:10:06.209 --> 00:10:08.689
I don’t have to tell you anything.

00:10:08.689 --> 00:10:15.189
Despite all that, one should have also the
wisdom how to deal with others, how to talk

00:10:15.189 --> 00:10:25.110
to others, how to behave towards others, how
not to control anyone, not to say something

00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:28.410
that would be rather harsh or hurting.

00:10:28.410 --> 00:10:36.050
Because, if you are trying to spread Sahaja
Yoga, this is the only way we can go forward,

00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:40.009
is to look after everyone with great compassion.

00:10:40.009 --> 00:10:50.459
Now, we might think that wisdom is there with
us and we know how to do so many things with

00:10:50.459 --> 00:10:54.529
our wisdom and now we are absolutely wise.

00:10:54.529 --> 00:10:59.800
Agree, with Sahaja Yogis, now they have become
really very, very wise and they know how to

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:05.540
use their wisdom.
But still, faith in themselves really has

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:09.569
to be of the Nirvikalpa state.

00:11:09.569 --> 00:11:14.209
That is only possible also through Shri Ganesha
because He is in Nirvikalpa.

00:11:14.209 --> 00:11:17.040
He has Nirvikalpas, nothing.

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:19.430
He doesn’t have to question anything.

00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:21.829
He doesn’t have to ask for anything.

00:11:21.829 --> 00:11:23.610
He is just there.

00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:26.379
And He’s in complete Nirvikalpa.

00:11:26.379 --> 00:11:35.899
Complete, absolutely into a state where He
is not at all attached, nor is He worrying

00:11:35.899 --> 00:11:38.089
about things, nothing of the kind.

00:11:38.089 --> 00:11:43.060
He is just in Nirvikalpa and in that Nirvikalpa
He worships Mother.

00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:51.379
Small, small stories can show you how He was
so sure of himself, how He had courage and

00:11:51.379 --> 00:11:57.830
how He worked out everything so intelligently.

00:11:57.830 --> 00:12:02.360
But when you are doing something, you can
be in two minds.

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:09.800
You can be not so decisive, but He was and
He is, always very decisive that He knows

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:13.009
what is to be done. Like that [straight].
This is the point.

00:12:13.009 --> 00:12:15.730
So, in wisdom you don’t have to think, argue.

00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:21.240
I’ve seen many people who say, "Mother, you
see, we were thinking, then we had vibrations.

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:28.600
We didn’t know what to do, this, that, how
to do, how to correct, how to work it out".

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:32.579
Now, I must say this is a state.

00:12:32.579 --> 00:12:37.870
It is not a state to be achieved, but it’s
a state.

00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:39.129
Means you are there.

00:12:39.129 --> 00:12:45.279
It has to be innately built in yourself, this
state of wisdom.

00:12:45.279 --> 00:12:54.819
But you can also work it out by just concentrating
on yourself and trying to find out Òwhat’s

00:12:54.819 --> 00:13:00.350
the matter with me, what happens, why, why
is it I’m like this.

00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:07.220
The introspection can help you a lot to be
extremely wise, but Ø easier method is to

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:15.440
worship the principle of innocence within
yourself.

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:24.670
For example now, we are dealing with, supposing,
somebody who is a thief, say.

00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:26.910
He’s a thief now.

00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:29.769
What should you do with a thief?

00:13:29.769 --> 00:13:35.750
After you have found out whatever was lost,
the material you had, after that, what are

00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:42.290
you to do is just to forget about it completely.

00:13:42.290 --> 00:13:48.959
Once it has happened, then you have to just
forget. Not to worry about it too much, "Oh,

00:13:48.959 --> 00:13:56.459
this has happened, that has happened. And how
to make this point all right? And this gentleman

00:13:56.459 --> 00:13:58.459
is not all right.This, that".

00:13:58.459 --> 00:14:06.089
Just forget it.
So, the wisdom is also in forgiving.

00:14:06.089 --> 00:14:10.069
That why Christ talked about forgiveness.
Just forgive.

00:14:10.069 --> 00:14:13.499
There’s no sense in remembering.

00:14:13.499 --> 00:14:16.990
"This person said so, this person did so, that
happened".

00:14:16.990 --> 00:14:22.160
So, just forget it. And once you start forgetting
all these things, you know, you’ll remember

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:25.870
right things and useless things you’ll just
forgive.

00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:32.519
You don’t remember who has insulted you,
who has troubled you, who has been misbehaving.

00:14:32.519 --> 00:14:37.009
I don’t even think about people who have
gone out of Sahaja Yoga, talking ill about me

00:14:37.009 --> 00:14:38.660
saying things, this, that.

00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:39.829
It’s all right.

00:14:39.829 --> 00:14:43.420
Let them say whatever they like, I am not
bothered.

00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:48.559
But what bothers me more, that if they do
like this, I don’t know what will happen to them.

00:14:48.649 --> 00:14:54.161
That’s the only wisdom part of it, that,
you see, when I forgive everyone, I say,

00:14:54.161 --> 00:14:56.790
"Baba, I have nothing to say".

00:14:56.790 --> 00:15:01.770
But then also a thought comes in, that if
they’re doing like this, then what’s going

00:15:01.770 --> 00:15:03.550
to happen to them?

00:15:03.550 --> 00:15:11.680
They’re doing this to someone who’s so
good, who’s so religious, so highly placed

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:13.670
in spiritual life.

00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:18.930
Then you can’t play about. But somebody is
playing! Then what you have to do is to really

00:15:18.930 --> 00:15:25.160
forgive because one thing is built-in, in Sahaja
Yoga, that who try to trouble you, they will

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:29.959
be in trouble also.
So, try to forgive at least. At least, you soothe him down,

00:15:29.949 --> 00:15:31.290
"All right, I forgive you".

00:15:31.290 --> 00:15:33.890
So, soothe him down.

00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:40.019
Like this kind of a wisdom you should have,
not to get after people, not to pester some

00:15:40.019 --> 00:15:51.680
one, not to be very strict, not to be very
sort of pursue, I should say, pursue the matter.

00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:56.110
Whatever is it, that point you should finish
off and just don’t worry.

00:15:56.110 --> 00:16:00.860
I was telling just now that there is a servant,
supposing.

00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:03.300
Now, he steals your money, all the time.

00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:05.749
You know he steals your money.

00:16:05.749 --> 00:16:10.209
Now what to do if he’s stealing your money?
One thing is to get out, to ask him to get

00:16:10.209 --> 00:16:11.209
out.

00:16:11.209 --> 00:16:12.329
Then you have another one.

00:16:12.329 --> 00:16:14.939
Then again you get him out and get another
one.

00:16:14.939 --> 00:16:21.670
It goes on like that because they’re poor people, they just steal if they get.
Now even if you’re careful, still they might

00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:27.569
steal, so what you should do is just to forgive
the person and put the money in such a place

00:16:27.569 --> 00:16:29.670
that he cannot reach.

00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:31.200
Finished.

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:32.649
As simple as this.

00:16:32.649 --> 00:16:37.329
You should just find out what does he steal.

00:16:37.329 --> 00:16:39.070
Oh, that’s all.

00:16:39.070 --> 00:16:45.839
Then you keep it one side.
But don’t worry about all the time that,

00:16:45.839 --> 00:16:52.560
"Now, how am I to save myself from this thief?
Or, how am I to punish him?" Just don’t think.

00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:57.879
These incidents are just like a breeze coming
and going.

00:16:57.879 --> 00:17:00.370
These relationships are just like that.

00:17:00.370 --> 00:17:02.009
There’s no depth in it.

00:17:02.009 --> 00:17:10.059
They’re not going to bring any kind of unhappiness
or happiness, whatever it is, if you go on

00:17:10.059 --> 00:17:15.380
lingering about them.
So, the first thing is live in the present.

00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:18.400
The wisdom is in living in the present.

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:22.029
Present, we are here, so forget the past.

00:17:22.029 --> 00:17:27.409
Now, if I say, "Forget the past", one may say,
"How to do it? How to forget the past?"

00:17:27.409 --> 00:17:31.539
Again, I would say, meditation is the only
way.

00:17:31.539 --> 00:17:37.640
You give up your left and you give up your
right and you are just standing in the centre,

00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:44.159
enjoying the wisdom, enjoying the joy of your
being.

00:17:44.159 --> 00:17:54.960
So, the best part of our lives is spent in
bothering, in getting upset, in getting worried,

00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:59.279
getting after someone.

00:17:59.279 --> 00:18:04.669
Where is the time? Just think like that.

00:18:04.669 --> 00:18:10.299
Now supposing someone says something to me
and then others will say, Mother, you must

00:18:10.299 --> 00:18:11.299
do something about it.

00:18:11.299 --> 00:18:12.909
You must punish that person.

00:18:12.909 --> 00:18:22.720
Where is the time? We have to awaken the kundalini
of thousands and thousands and thousands and

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:30.970
here we are just worried about something nonsensical.
So, our wisdom is finished.

00:18:30.970 --> 00:18:35.390
We have no wisdom at all.

00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:39.480
Even at the highest level, you can see people
don’t have wisdom.

00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:53.809
Highest level of realization I’ve seen people
who do not have wisdom in the sense that

00:18:53.809 --> 00:19:00.700
they want to run away, they just get fed up,
take sannyasa, finished, go to Himalayas, live

00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:01.700
there happily.

00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:04.340
There’s no wisdom in that also.

00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:09.630
So living in the present you don’t also
feel tired because you don’t think of the

00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:16.220
past and the future and you live very well
and in great happiness, you improve things

00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:21.399
and you don’t think of the future, what
is going to happen to me or anything. And that’s

00:19:21.399 --> 00:19:29.090
how you save lot of troubles of others, as
well as yours.

00:19:29.090 --> 00:19:39.530
So, this wisdom is to live in the present.
It's now that you ask somebody, "How are you?"

00:19:39.530 --> 00:19:40.820
"All right [means not good]".

00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:44.140
Then, he is not in the present.

00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:50.240
You ask somebody, "Are you enjoying yourself?"
[Not much] Not in the present.

00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:55.730
You ask somebody, "Are you happy?" "No".

00:19:55.730 --> 00:19:58.750
Then you are not in the present.

00:19:58.750 --> 00:20:06.440
You ask someone that, "Are you hungry?" "Maybe,
may not be".

00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:12.340
I mean, they don’t know, even in the present,
if they are hungry or not.

00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:17.480
It’s so much that they’re lost in the
past and in the future, that’s the sign

00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:20.030
of unwise behavior, unwise line,

00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:26.000
if they don’t know whether they’d like
to have their food or not.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:31.880
But those who are really in the present forget
all these small, small things.

00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:36.470
They’re just in the present. And in the present,
whatever they have to do, they will do it.

00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:39.470
This is a very good practice.

00:20:39.470 --> 00:20:44.840
One has to to practice wisdom through living
in the present.

00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:48.710
Just think, "What I have to do just now? What
am I to do".

00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:53.110
Like you are getting out of the house.

00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:57.730
Many people will go half way, "Oh, my God!
I have left my passport".

00:20:57.730 --> 00:20:59.690
They’ll go back.

00:20:59.690 --> 00:21:02.210
Then again, some time they will come out.

00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:04.170
"My God, I have left my spectacles".

00:21:04.170 --> 00:21:05.800
Again go back.

00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:08.820
Then again they will come back and say, "I
have lost this.

00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:09.890
I should have this".

00:21:09.890 --> 00:21:13.040
This kind of people are very, very common.

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:17.890
So, at that time when you are leaving the house,
at that time, if you are in the

00:21:17.890 --> 00:21:23.820
present, then you just think, "What have I
to take? Let's see, one, two, three, four,

00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:25.020
five, yes.

00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:28.419
This is is what I have to take and this
there".

00:21:28.419 --> 00:21:39.429
That’s how you can really establish yourself
in wisdom itself. Means, the wisdom acts by itself.

00:21:39.429 --> 00:21:41.010
It’s a power.

00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:42.279
Wisdom is a very big power.

00:21:42.279 --> 00:21:45.650
If you are a wise person, it’s a power.

00:21:45.650 --> 00:21:51.899
It can combat any kind of ignorance, any kind
of attacks, any kind of stupidity.

00:21:51.899 --> 00:21:59.130
It’s such a tremendous power that God has
given us, that we are wise. And this wisdom,

00:21:59.130 --> 00:22:07.570
you should try to really, to develop it and
mature it properly, within ourselves.

00:22:07.570 --> 00:22:10.940
So, today’s Shri Ganesha’s Puja is there,

00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:16.170
while we should ask for wisdom. And for that,
we have to be in the present.

00:22:16.170 --> 00:22:20.169
Every way, you should be in the present.

00:22:20.169 --> 00:22:27.070
If you can try, you can be, because your Kundalini
has been awakened, and you can be all the time

00:22:27.070 --> 00:22:35.320
in the present. But today, you should first
try and get the Kundalini established in the

00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:36.930
present.

00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:40.360
May God bless you.
