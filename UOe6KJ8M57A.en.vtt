00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.910
15 Dec 1991 Shri Ganesha
Puja: He’s a giver of wisdom. Shere (India)

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:14.119
Today we are really sitting in very close
relationship with the nature.

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:22.380
The whole thing, as you can see very clearly,
is done by villagers and in a very simple

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:42.110
way and I’m sure you must all be enjoying
it very much.

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:52.860
Today being the first puja in Maharashtra,
we'll have to do Ganesha Puja, but one has to

00:00:52.860 --> 00:01:04.230
understand how it is so impor-tant in Maharashtra
that people worship Ganesha.

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:16.500
As you know there are Ashtavinayakas, eight Ganeshas are
there around this area and this triangle of

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:26.600
Maharashtra which has got on one side one big
mountain,

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:33.460
on the other side, we have another mountain
which, of course, is not in Maharashtra.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.629
And also, on top, we have another mountain.

00:01:35.629 --> 00:01:46.290
So, like a triangle which is made like a Mooladhara,
means the Kundalini itself.

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.980
So, the Kundalini of the whole world resides
in this area.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:57.080
That’s why it is called, we should say,
as Maharashtra, as the country which is very

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.730
great, the nation which is very great.

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:11.170
But I don’t know how far Maharashtrans realize
that they are sitting in the land of Maharashtra.

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:27.020
This land which is vibrated by Shri Ganesha
has its own simplicity, has its own vibrations,

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:32.920
a different style, a different type.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:44.330
The best part of Maharashtra is that it gives
you a very good attention.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:56.459
With Ganesha so much vibrating, the attention
becomes very concentrated and this concentration

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:06.310
helps you in so many ways. And that is why
it is said that Ganesha was created to spread

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:13.270
or to emit auspiciousness and holiness.

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:18.030
Actually, if there is holiness there is auspiciousness.

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:30.349
For Ganesha is actually the one who cleanses
everything, cleanses everything because it

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:38.510
is innocence. And the innocence that cleanses
you takes away all kinds of conditionings

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:44.239
and egos that are distracting your attention.

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:51.860
So, the attention which is so wobbly otherwise,
in other places, can settle down very well

00:03:51.860 --> 00:04:01.000
in Maharashtra. Because of Shri Ganesha’s
blessings that this country has, that people

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.810
have very good attention.

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:13.430
With that good attention, they can really do
so many things. Like now, for example, you

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.090
can see the software,

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:17.409
good mathematics.

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:25.660
They’re very good at music because all these
things require tremendous attention.

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:35.859
Art, dancing, anything which requires tremendous
attention, that has to come only through Ganesha.

00:04:35.859 --> 00:04:40.010
Because they say Ganesha is a giver of wisdom.

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:43.070
He’s a giver of wisdom.

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:48.510
means just wisdom becomes a dharma,
becomes a part and parcel of your being.

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:50.380
You become just wise.

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:52.739
Now somebody may ask, "Mother how to become
wise?"

00:04:52.739 --> 00:04:56.130
It’s very difficult to say how to become
wise.

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:59.890
It is just that it happens that you become
wise.

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:03.419
So, though He’s a child, He’s so matured.

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:05.320
He’s so wise.

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:17.999
And He’s not only that, but He emits wisdom
and this wisdom is an in-nate quality of anyone

00:05:17.999 --> 00:05:24.119
who is a Sahaja Yogi. Because in him, also,
Shri Ganesha has been awakened.

00:05:24.119 --> 00:05:31.880
So, he becomes a wise person, very wise, and
with wisdom what does he achieve? He achieves

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:43.040
a balance, a proper ascent and also he understands
that this ascent is for his benevolence, for

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:46.829
the benevolence of his country, benevolence
of the whole world.

00:05:46.829 --> 00:05:49.899
He understands the importance of Sahaja Yoga.

00:05:49.899 --> 00:05:53.350
Without this wisdom, one cannot understand.

00:05:53.350 --> 00:06:02.950
And this wisdom is within us, just absolutely,
innately built-in.

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:09.570
Only thing is, we have to use the storehouse
of this wisdom that is within us.

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:14.999
Of course, with Sahaja Yoga, it starts emitting
and you start feeling and you start understanding

00:06:14.999 --> 00:06:16.459
what is wisdom is.

00:06:16.459 --> 00:06:19.729
You give up all your stupid, childish things.

00:06:19.729 --> 00:06:23.029
You give up all your attachments.

00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:28.769
You give up many of your, say, things that
you don’t like which doesn’t behove you.

00:06:28.769 --> 00:06:32.170
You feel that you should give up, but you
cannot.

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:38.160
But, with Sahaja Yoga, it just happens automatically
and you just see in your light what is needed,

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:39.649
what is not needed.

00:06:39.649 --> 00:06:42.460
In that wisdom, you throw away whatever is
wrong.

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:49.410
So, that a great work this Ganesha has to do
within ourselves!

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:55.739
This manifestation of Ganesha within us is
very important, I think. Not that it is only

00:06:55.739 --> 00:07:02.620
the basis, but also the foundation stone
of spiritual life is Shri Ganesha.

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:11.540
That’s why I have been very anxious that
we should find out proper schools for our children.

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:15.730
They should have proper education and t Ëhey
should be looked after because their Ganesh

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:17.290
Tattwa is already there.

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:22.380
Only thing we have to nourish it, we have
to look after it and make it grow.

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:25.529
Once that happens then children are safe.

00:07:25.529 --> 00:07:28.389
Then nothing, nothing can harm them.

00:07:28.389 --> 00:07:31.410
Nothing they will absorb which is wrong.

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:35.540
They will never be again in the wrong path.

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:41.769
But from early childhood, if you never had
this kind of training or this kind of understanding

00:07:41.769 --> 00:07:50.809
about Kundalini or about the wisdom part of it,
you can never, later on, easily assimilate it.

00:07:50.839 --> 00:07:58.559
For that, you really require a great effort
and understanding that you have to have this.

00:07:58.559 --> 00:08:00.839
It’s so beauti-ful.

00:08:00.839 --> 00:08:06.190
You must get this attention and you must get
this innocence within.

00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:12.219
With Sahaja Yoga, as you see, it’s working
out very fast and people are getting, really,

00:08:12.219 --> 00:08:17.889
very wise and I can see the wisdom written large
on their faces.

00:08:17.889 --> 00:08:29.239
In this wisdom, what do we find here? You see,
on any line that we move, we can find that

00:08:29.239 --> 00:08:38.450
most of our problems are coming from human
beings. Because ecological problem, or any

00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:43.110
problem we think of, comes from human beings.

00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:48.839
Or other problems that you have in your own
country, as you have seen, that they are such

00:08:48.839 --> 00:08:53.730
problems that it’s sort of endless and you
cannot change them.

00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:59.159
You feel very nice sitting underneath this,
because you are fed up with the same ways that you have and

00:08:59.159 --> 00:09:07.810
the problems that it causes to you and the
way it is now becoming very artificial.

00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:19.690
But in these circumstances, one has to understand
that the wisdom plays such a part in life,

00:09:19.690 --> 00:09:26.169
that whatever may happen outside, whatever
may be the trend, whatever may be the fashion,

00:09:26.169 --> 00:09:31.310
whatever maybe the people are all changing
into, you do not change.

00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:33.000
You change within.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:41.950
Once you are changed within, then you have
full idea as to what is expected of others,

00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:48.700
what they should do, what you are doing and
how to deal with them and how to talk to them,

00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:53.010
how to tell them, how far to go with them
– everything.

00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:59.050
All this comes through wisdom.
In Sahaja Yoga, as you know, you are very

00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:04.539
capable people, you have achieved a lot, you
know everything, you know all about chakras.

00:10:04.539 --> 00:10:06.289
You know practically everything.

00:10:06.289 --> 00:10:08.769
I don’t have to tell you anything.

00:10:08.769 --> 00:10:15.269
Despite all that, one should have also the
wisdom how to deal with others, how to talk

00:10:15.269 --> 00:10:25.190
to others, how to behave towards others, how
not to control anyone, not to say something

00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:28.490
that would be rather harsh or hurting.

00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:36.130
Because, if you are trying to spread Sahaja
Yoga, this is the only way we can go forward,

00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:40.089
is to look after everyone with great compassion.

00:10:40.089 --> 00:10:50.539
Now, we might think that wisdom is there with
us and we know how to do so many things with

00:10:50.539 --> 00:10:54.609
our wisdom and now we are absolutely wise.

00:10:54.609 --> 00:10:59.880
Agree, with Sahaja Yogis, now they have become
really very, very wise and they know how to

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:05.620
use their wisdom.
But still, faith in themselves really has

00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:09.649
to be of the Nirvikalpa state.

00:11:09.649 --> 00:11:14.289
That is only possible also through Shri Ganesha
because He is in Nirvikalpa.

00:11:14.289 --> 00:11:17.120
He has Nirvikalpas, nothing.

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:19.510
He doesn’t have to question anything.

00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:21.909
He doesn’t have to ask for anything.

00:11:21.909 --> 00:11:23.690
He is just there.

00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:26.459
And He’s in complete Nirvikalpa.

00:11:26.459 --> 00:11:35.979
Complete, absolutely into a state where He
is not at all attached, nor is He worrying

00:11:35.979 --> 00:11:38.169
about things, nothing of the kind.

00:11:38.169 --> 00:11:43.140
He is just in Nirvikalpa and in that Nirvikalpa
He worships Mother.

00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:51.459
Small, small stories can show you how He was
so sure of himself, how He had courage and

00:11:51.459 --> 00:11:57.910
how He worked out everything so intelligently.

00:11:57.910 --> 00:12:02.440
But when you are doing something, you can
be in two minds.

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:09.880
You can be not so decisive, but He was and
He is, always very decisive that He knows

00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:13.089
what is to be done. Like that [straight].
This is the point.

00:12:13.089 --> 00:12:15.810
So, in wisdom you don’t have to think, argue.

00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:21.320
I’ve seen many people who say, "Mother, you
see, we were thinking, then we had vibrations.

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:28.680
We didn’t know what to do, this, that, how
to do, how to correct, how to work it out".

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:32.659
Now, I must say this is a state.

00:12:32.659 --> 00:12:37.950
It is not a state to be achieved, but it’s
a state.

00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:39.209
Means you are there.

00:12:39.209 --> 00:12:45.359
It has to be innately built in yourself, this
state of wisdom.

00:12:45.359 --> 00:12:54.899
But you can also work it out by just concentrating
on yourself and trying to find out Òwhat’s

00:12:54.899 --> 00:13:00.430
the matter with me, what happens, why, why
is it I’m like this.

00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:07.300
The introspection can help you a lot to be
extremely wise, but Ø easier method is to

00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:15.520
worship the principle of innocence within
yourself.

00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:24.750
For example now, we are dealing with, supposing,
somebody who is a thief, say.

00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:26.990
He’s a thief now.

00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:29.849
What should you do with a thief?

00:13:29.849 --> 00:13:35.830
After you have found out whatever was lost,
the material you had, after that, what are

00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:42.370
you to do is just to forget about it completely.

00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:49.039
Once it has happened, then you have to just
forget. Not to worry about it too much, "Oh,

00:13:49.039 --> 00:13:56.539
this has happened, that has happened. And how
to make this point all right? And this gentleman

00:13:56.539 --> 00:13:58.539
is not all right.This, that".

00:13:58.539 --> 00:14:06.169
Just forget it.
So, the wisdom is also in forgiving.

00:14:06.169 --> 00:14:10.149
That why Christ talked about forgiveness.
Just forgive.

00:14:10.149 --> 00:14:13.579
There’s no sense in remembering.

00:14:13.579 --> 00:14:17.070
"This person said so, this person did so, that
happened".

00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:22.240
So, just forget it. And once you start forgetting
all these things, you know, you’ll remember

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:25.950
right things and useless things you’ll just
forgive.

00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:32.599
You don’t remember who has insulted you,
who has troubled you, who has been misbehaving.

00:14:32.599 --> 00:14:37.089
I don’t even think about people who have
gone out of Sahaja Yoga, talking ill about me

00:14:37.089 --> 00:14:38.740
saying things, this, that.

00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:39.909
It’s all right.

00:14:39.909 --> 00:14:43.500
Let them say whatever they like, I am not
bothered.

00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:48.639
But what bothers me more, that if they do
like this, I don’t know what will happen to them.

00:14:48.729 --> 00:14:54.241
That’s the only wisdom part of it, that,
you see, when I forgive everyone, I say,

00:14:54.241 --> 00:14:56.870
"Baba, I have nothing to say".

00:14:56.870 --> 00:15:01.850
But then also a thought comes in, that if
they’re doing like this, then what’s going

00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:03.630
to happen to them?

00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:11.760
They’re doing this to someone who’s so
good, who’s so religious, so highly placed

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:13.750
in spiritual life.

00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:19.010
Then you can’t play about. But somebody is
playing! Then what you have to do is to really

00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:25.240
forgive because one thing is built-in, in Sahaja
Yoga, that who try to trouble you, they will

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:30.039
be in trouble also.
So, try to forgive at least. At least, you soothe him down,

00:15:30.029 --> 00:15:31.370
"All right, I forgive you".

00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:33.970
So, soothe him down.

00:15:33.970 --> 00:15:40.099
Like this kind of a wisdom you should have,
not to get after people, not to pester some

00:15:40.099 --> 00:15:51.760
one, not to be very strict, not to be very
sort of pursue, I should say, pursue the matter.

00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:56.190
Whatever is it, that point you should finish
off and just don’t worry.

00:15:56.190 --> 00:16:00.940
I was telling just now that there is a servant,
supposing.

00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:03.380
Now, he steals your money, all the time.

00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:05.829
You know he steals your money.

00:16:05.829 --> 00:16:10.289
Now what to do if he’s stealing your money?
One thing is to get out, to ask him to get

00:16:10.289 --> 00:16:11.289
out.

00:16:11.289 --> 00:16:12.409
Then you have another one.

00:16:12.409 --> 00:16:15.019
Then again you get him out and get another
one.

00:16:15.019 --> 00:16:21.750
It goes on like that because they’re poor people, they just steal if they get.
Now even if you’re careful, still they might

00:16:21.750 --> 00:16:27.649
steal, so what you should do is just to forgive
the person and put the money in such a place

00:16:27.649 --> 00:16:29.750
that he cannot reach.

00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:31.280
Finished.

00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:32.729
As simple as this.

00:16:32.729 --> 00:16:37.409
You should just find out what does he steal.

00:16:37.409 --> 00:16:39.150
Oh, that’s all.

00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:45.919
Then you keep it one side.
But don’t worry about all the time that,

00:16:45.919 --> 00:16:52.640
"Now, how am I to save myself from this thief?
Or, how am I to punish him?" Just don’t think.

00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:57.959
These incidents are just like a breeze coming
and going.

00:16:57.959 --> 00:17:00.450
These relationships are just like that.

00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:02.089
There’s no depth in it.

00:17:02.089 --> 00:17:10.139
They’re not going to bring any kind of unhappiness
or happiness, whatever it is, if you go on

00:17:10.139 --> 00:17:15.460
lingering about them.
So, the first thing is live in the present.

00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:18.480
The wisdom is in living in the present.

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:22.109
Present, we are here, so forget the past.

00:17:22.109 --> 00:17:27.489
Now, if I say, "Forget the past", one may say,
"How to do it? How to forget the past?"

00:17:27.489 --> 00:17:31.619
Again, I would say, meditation is the only
way.

00:17:31.619 --> 00:17:37.720
You give up your left and you give up your
right and you are just standing in the centre,

00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:44.239
enjoying the wisdom, enjoying the joy of your
being.

00:17:44.239 --> 00:17:55.040
So, the best part of our lives is spent in
bothering, in getting upset, in getting worried,

00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:59.359
getting after someone.

00:17:59.359 --> 00:18:04.749
Where is the time? Just think like that.

00:18:04.749 --> 00:18:10.379
Now supposing someone says something to me
and then others will say, Mother, you must

00:18:10.379 --> 00:18:11.379
do something about it.

00:18:11.379 --> 00:18:12.989
You must punish that person.

00:18:12.989 --> 00:18:22.800
Where is the time? We have to awaken the kundalini
of thousands and thousands and thousands and

00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:31.050
here we are just worried about something nonsensical.
So, our wisdom is finished.

00:18:31.050 --> 00:18:35.470
We have no wisdom at all.

00:18:35.470 --> 00:18:39.560
Even at the highest level, you can see people
don’t have wisdom.

00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:53.889
Highest level of realization I’ve seen people
who do not have wisdom in the sense that

00:18:53.889 --> 00:19:00.780
they want to run away, they just get fed up,
take sannyasa, finished, go to Himalayas, live

00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:01.780
there happily.

00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:04.420
There’s no wisdom in that also.

00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:09.710
So living in the present you don’t also
feel tired because you don’t think of the

00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:16.300
past and the future and you live very well
and in great happiness, you improve things

00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:21.479
and you don’t think of the future, what
is going to happen to me or anything. And that’s

00:19:21.479 --> 00:19:29.170
how you save lot of troubles of others, as
well as yours.

00:19:29.170 --> 00:19:39.610
So, this wisdom is to live in the present.
It's now that you ask somebody, "How are you?"

00:19:39.610 --> 00:19:40.900
"All right [means not good]".

00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:44.220
Then, he is not in the present.

00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:50.320
You ask somebody, "Are you enjoying yourself?"
[Not much] Not in the present.

00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:55.810
You ask somebody, "Are you happy?" "No".

00:19:55.810 --> 00:19:58.830
Then you are not in the present.

00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:06.520
You ask someone that, "Are you hungry?" "Maybe,
may not be".

00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:12.420
I mean, they don’t know, even in the present,
if they are hungry or not.

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:17.560
It’s so much that they’re lost in the
past and in the future, that’s the sign

00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:20.110
of unwise behavior, unwise line,

00:20:20.110 --> 00:20:26.080
if they don’t know whether they’d like
to have their food or not.

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:31.960
But those who are really in the present forget
all these small, small things.

00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:36.550
They’re just in the present. And in the present,
whatever they have to do, they will do it.

00:20:36.550 --> 00:20:39.550
This is a very good practice.

00:20:39.550 --> 00:20:44.920
One has to to practice wisdom through living
in the present.

00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:48.790
Just think, "What I have to do just now? What
am I to do".

00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:53.190
Like you are getting out of the house.

00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:57.810
Many people will go half way, "Oh, my God!
I have left my passport".

00:20:57.810 --> 00:20:59.770
They’ll go back.

00:20:59.770 --> 00:21:02.290
Then again, some time they will come out.

00:21:02.290 --> 00:21:04.250
"My God, I have left my spectacles".

00:21:04.250 --> 00:21:05.880
Again go back.

00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:08.900
Then again they will come back and say, "I
have lost this.

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:09.970
I should have this".

00:21:09.970 --> 00:21:13.120
This kind of people are very, very common.

00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:17.970
So, at that time when you are leaving the house,
at that time, if you are in the

00:21:17.970 --> 00:21:23.900
present, then you just think, "What have I
to take? Let's see, one, two, three, four,

00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:25.100
five, yes.

00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:28.499
This is is what I have to take and this
there".

00:21:28.499 --> 00:21:39.509
That’s how you can really establish yourself
in wisdom itself. Means, the wisdom acts by itself.

00:21:39.509 --> 00:21:41.090
It’s a power.

00:21:41.090 --> 00:21:42.359
Wisdom is a very big power.

00:21:42.359 --> 00:21:45.730
If you are a wise person, it’s a power.

00:21:45.730 --> 00:21:51.979
It can combat any kind of ignorance, any kind
of attacks, any kind of stupidity.

00:21:51.979 --> 00:21:59.210
It’s such a tremendous power that God has
given us, that we are wise. And this wisdom,

00:21:59.210 --> 00:22:07.650
you should try to really, to develop it and
mature it properly, within ourselves.

00:22:07.650 --> 00:22:11.020
So, today’s Shri Ganesha’s Puja is there,

00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:16.250
while we should ask for wisdom. And for that,
we have to be in the present.

00:22:16.250 --> 00:22:20.249
Every way, you should be in the present.

00:22:20.249 --> 00:22:27.150
If you can try, you can be, because your Kundalini
has been awakened, and you can be all the time

00:22:27.150 --> 00:22:35.400
in the present. But today, you should first
try and get the Kundalini established in the

00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:37.010
present.

00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:40.440
May God bless you.

00:22:42.205 --> 00:22:50.568
I was telling these people
that we will worhip Shri Ganesha today.

00:22:50.568 --> 00:22:56.848
A very significant function
of Shri Ganesha takes place in our body.

00:22:56.848 --> 00:23:05.168
Mind, intellect and body
– the control over all of these is Ganesh.

00:23:05.168 --> 00:23:13.568
The special gift bestowed on us by Shri
Ganesh is wisdom.

00:23:13.568 --> 00:23:16.968
Wisdom is one thing that we
don’t get by asking.

00:23:16.968 --> 00:23:22.048
If someone says that I will
give you wisdom, you should never believe.

00:23:22.048 --> 00:23:35.408
“After speaking in English, to speak
in Marathi I do not get appropriate words.

00:23:35.408 --> 00:23:40.408
I lose the continuity
if I have to speak in both the languages”.

00:23:40.408 --> 00:23:44.368
So there is no equivalent
for wisdom in Marathi.

00:23:44.368 --> 00:23:47.008
What do you say? No , not Vidvatta.

00:23:53.371 --> 00:23:58.688
That's why I started in english.

00:23:58.738 --> 00:24:02.965
“Sudnyata.” ‘Sudnyata’
is a little serious word.

00:24:02.981 --> 00:24:04.048
OK.

00:24:04.088 --> 00:24:09.835
Let’s call it sudnyata,
instead of subuddhi.

00:24:09.835 --> 00:24:16.648
We should inculcate
that wisdom (sudnyata) in ourselves.

00:24:16.648 --> 00:24:18.491
How to do that?

00:24:18.491 --> 00:24:20.705
For that, you should
learn to live in the present.

00:24:20.705 --> 00:24:21.745
I teach that.

00:24:21.770 --> 00:24:24.965
Now in the present, at this time,
we are sitting here.

00:24:24.965 --> 00:24:26.228
This worship is taking place.

00:24:26.253 --> 00:24:27.933
And we are sitting here.

00:24:27.979 --> 00:24:33.528
So what is the
wisdom at this time?

00:24:33.528 --> 00:24:36.088
That, the puja is taking place.
We have to do the puja.

00:24:36.088 --> 00:24:38.756
But at this moment if
we think of the future

00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:40.876
whether I will get the return bus or not?

00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:43.048
Will get food at home or not?

00:24:43.048 --> 00:24:45.425
If something like this happens?

00:24:45.425 --> 00:24:47.478
If I am unable to go then?

00:24:47.478 --> 00:24:49.065
If this and that about my son…

00:24:49.065 --> 00:24:53.208
If we think like this then you will
not be benefitted by the puja.

00:24:53.208 --> 00:24:58.088
If we think about the past, this happened,
that happened, did this

00:24:58.088 --> 00:25:00.968
then it will again create a total mess.

00:25:00.968 --> 00:25:07.328
So this wisdom is something that one
should develop within us.

00:25:07.328 --> 00:25:09.608
There is a method to do this.

00:25:09.608 --> 00:25:11.356
Every time, wherever we are,

00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:14.036
we should examine whether we
are in the present or in the past.

00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:18.888
Because past is over and
future is not discernible.

00:25:18.888 --> 00:25:19.616


00:25:19.651 --> 00:25:21.985
I got stuck due to the
word sudnyata (for wisdom)

00:25:21.986 --> 00:25:29.458
We can call it as Sudnyata but in Sudnyata ...

00:25:29.458 --> 00:25:33.558
but it (wisdom)  is more deeper than that ( Sudnyata)

00:25:33.571 --> 00:25:35.385
There are many things in it.

00:25:35.385 --> 00:25:39.158
In English, only one
word is there – wisdom.

00:25:39.158 --> 00:25:43.125
But we may call it as sudnyata
in our Marathi language.

00:25:43.125 --> 00:25:46.618
We could say subuddhi (wisdom),
samaysuchakta (presence of mind) or

00:25:46.678 --> 00:25:52.605
dakshata (alertness).
Let’s call it dakshata. Dakshata.

00:25:52.605 --> 00:25:54.958
There are several words for it.

00:25:54.958 --> 00:25:58.996
They all are easily
achievable by one thing

00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:08.008
if we manage to stay in the present.

00:26:08.008 --> 00:26:11.585
Now I have heard that people
quarrel a lot over here.

00:26:11.585 --> 00:26:14.088
Quarrels take place.
Why do they happen?

00:26:14.088 --> 00:26:18.568
Because your father’s father
had beaten me so started quarreling.

00:26:18.568 --> 00:26:21.196
Now the father is dead, his father is
also dead

00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:26.688
– now you are in present .why to fight on those things?

00:26:26.688 --> 00:26:34.036
Otherwise, I will beat you, I will hammer you –
keep saying something like this of the future.

00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:36.448
What am I going to do right now?

00:26:36.448 --> 00:26:38.236
You came in front of me,

00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:40.928
what am I going to do with you?

00:26:40.928 --> 00:26:42.145
No such thinking.

00:26:42.145 --> 00:26:45.088
What should
be done at this time?

00:26:45.088 --> 00:26:48.916
Whatever spontaneous
response one has at time,

00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:52.526
that presence of mind
is the one that matters.

00:26:52.550 --> 00:26:56.218
We will realize immediately that the
quarrel must be resolved right then.

00:26:56.218 --> 00:26:57.888
A good Chance.

00:26:57.888 --> 00:27:02.408
A good opportunity has come.

00:27:02.408 --> 00:27:06.556
When we say that this is the chance,

00:27:06.580 --> 00:27:12.145
then immediately the person
realizes what a good opportunity it is.

00:27:12.145 --> 00:27:16.088
So many quarrels of our ancestors
have come to an end.

00:27:16.088 --> 00:27:19.391
Why to make rounds of court?

00:27:19.391 --> 00:27:21.525
Why this, why that – Just end it.

00:27:21.578 --> 00:27:28.499
This sagacity that dwells on us, this timely
alertness is what is called as wisdom in English.

00:27:28.523 --> 00:27:30.408
But wisdom has many meanings.

00:27:30.408 --> 00:27:36.208
In our Marathi language
we have ten alternatives for each word.

00:27:36.208 --> 00:27:38.941
our Marathi language
is a very rich language.

00:27:38.951 --> 00:27:41.285
Hence we cannot
explain in one word.

00:27:41.305 --> 00:27:45.319
But still to be aware at that time,

00:27:45.343 --> 00:27:48.808
to have presence of mind at
that very moment is very essential.

00:27:48.808 --> 00:27:50.558
There are several other things.

00:27:50.558 --> 00:27:52.556
Suppose I have to start from my residence

00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:57.008
then I should think that as
I have to leave, what all things do I need?

00:27:57.008 --> 00:28:01.608
Wherever I stay at night,
what do I need there? Just at that time.

00:28:01.608 --> 00:28:06.011
But it so happens that it does not strike at
that time. At that time, some other thoughts.

00:28:06.011 --> 00:28:12.768
Once you sit in the car you realize that
you have forgotten this or that thing.

00:28:13.008 --> 00:28:17.008
So to inculcate this presence of mind
( samay suchakta),

00:28:17.008 --> 00:28:26.688
this wisdom , one should
learn to live in the present.

00:28:26.688 --> 00:28:33.168
Shivaji Maharaj was a great person
but he lived in the present.

00:28:33.168 --> 00:28:34.528
He was not like us.

00:28:34.528 --> 00:28:36.261
We revere Shivaji Maharaj.

00:28:36.298 --> 00:28:45.208
But in current times, what are the
qualities of Shivaji Maharaj that we have?

00:28:45.208 --> 00:28:51.408
Did he drink, first thing?

00:28:51.408 --> 00:28:53.445
How was his behavior?

00:28:53.445 --> 00:28:55.438
How was his character?

00:28:55.438 --> 00:29:02.568
While we respect him, do we emulate
his lifestyle in our present day lives?

00:29:02.568 --> 00:29:05.591
We give unnecessary
importance to past things.

00:29:05.591 --> 00:29:07.391
It is not going to benefit.

00:29:07.431 --> 00:29:10.813
We had Mahatma Gandhi, several others.

00:29:10.837 --> 00:29:14.305
it is said that several great
lotuses emerged in our country.

00:29:14.305 --> 00:29:18.458
But still it is a mere puddle.
All other persons are mere puddles.

00:29:18.458 --> 00:29:22.426
So we need to examine
if we are in a puddle or amongst lotuses.

00:29:22.458 --> 00:29:25.528
We should examine
where are we in these present times.

00:29:25.528 --> 00:29:27.996
Unless we acquire the wisdom to know this,

00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:32.368
till then Ganesha will not function in you.

00:29:32.368 --> 00:29:35.276
One attribute Ganesha has,

00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:39.528
is that he gives you sagacity, gives wisdom.

00:29:39.528 --> 00:29:43.608
Do you see wisdom anywhere?

00:29:43.608 --> 00:29:47.648
People quarrel right
in front of Shri Ganesh.

00:29:47.648 --> 00:29:52.320
They misappropriate money in the name
of Shri Ganesh, do this and do that.

00:29:52.338 --> 00:29:55.156
Means there is no wisdom at all.
Then where is Ganapati at such a place,

00:29:55.180 --> 00:29:58.608
you have only installed Shri Ganesha.

00:29:58.608 --> 00:30:10.408
A person, who uses timely prudence at an
appropriate time, at an appropriate moment

00:30:10.408 --> 00:30:16.008
his state will undergo
a significant change.

00:30:16.008 --> 00:30:17.836
You try this out

00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:21.728
and whatever growth you would achieve by being in
the present, will happen in the present itself.

00:30:21.728 --> 00:30:23.756
Now consider a flower,

00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:29.968
does it grow in the future or in the past?

00:30:29.968 --> 00:30:33.888
It will take place right now.

00:30:33.888 --> 00:30:37.998
This is the reason
why we do not progress.

00:30:37.998 --> 00:30:42.125
Because we think about
future or about past.

00:30:42.125 --> 00:30:45.408
But we do not
think of the present.

00:30:45.408 --> 00:30:48.848
We should examine
what our current state is.

00:30:48.848 --> 00:30:56.328
In that, all our problems
– such as rural issues- will get resolved.

00:30:56.328 --> 00:31:00.648
Suppose you have to do farming today, you
need to sow today-

00:31:00.648 --> 00:31:02.082
You will say,last time

00:31:02.107 --> 00:31:05.368
I sowed, this happened, that happened;
if you keep on doing this way then it’s gone

00:31:05.368 --> 00:31:08.020
or say , I will sow tomorrow
or day after – then you will lose that too.

00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:14.478
Whatever you need to do today,
you need to do, right at this moment.

00:31:14.478 --> 00:31:20.928
This is a practice in India.

00:31:20.928 --> 00:31:25.488
To keep on talking
a lot about the past.

00:31:25.488 --> 00:31:29.208
This happened, that happened.
But what about you?

00:31:29.208 --> 00:31:33.288
Where are you?

00:31:33.288 --> 00:31:36.608
In Sahaja Yoga
it is very essential.

00:31:36.608 --> 00:31:40.728
‘Mataji has given us realization’
Then, what after that?

00:31:40.728 --> 00:31:44.676
‘After that, nothing. Now that we have realization, we
are just sitting. Now we will pursue other pastimes.’

00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:54.848
Today, what do I need to do for that – if this thought
comes to you then you would benefit from it immediately?

00:31:54.848 --> 00:32:00.371
Quite a lot people have achieved realization,
many have benefitted from it. Seen miracles.

00:32:00.371 --> 00:32:02.999
But they forget that ‘ I have achieved my
realization.’

00:32:03.023 --> 00:32:05.378
Every moment,’I have achieved realization’.

00:32:05.402 --> 00:32:07.436
Right at this moment, ‘I have achieved
realization ‘;

00:32:07.460 --> 00:32:09.648
they do not remember this thing.

00:32:09.648 --> 00:32:11.471
Then they start
behaving the same way.

00:32:11.471 --> 00:32:13.165
The other day, one
person came to me.

00:32:13.165 --> 00:32:14.498
I had already
given him realization.

00:32:14.498 --> 00:32:16.168
He had already achieved
awareness. Everything was fine.

00:32:16.168 --> 00:32:18.405
But he told me ‘Mataji, I feel very afraid
these days.’

00:32:18.405 --> 00:32:22.131
‘you are a Sahaja Yogi. What are you
afraid of? Have you forgotten?’

00:32:22.131 --> 00:32:26.518
‘Oh yes. I had forgotten. I
had achieved realization.

00:32:26.518 --> 00:32:29.116
I should not be afraid of anything.’

00:32:29.140 --> 00:32:34.436
What can you say, even though everything
is bestowed on you, you just forgot

00:32:34.460 --> 00:32:39.139
and you still remember the
past when you were worthless,

00:32:39.163 --> 00:32:44.448
when you were incapable,
you did not understand anything.

00:32:45.054 --> 00:32:46.053
When you were ignorant

00:32:46.077 --> 00:32:49.808
or when you were
in the darkness or the

00:32:49.808 --> 00:32:55.658
light of the Almighty had not entered you.
Why to carry forward the things of the past.

00:32:55.658 --> 00:32:58.208
Why do you wish to
stick to old teachings?

00:32:58.208 --> 00:32:59.398
They are still present.

00:32:59.398 --> 00:33:03.578
When I go to
villages, I give realization to villagers.

00:33:03.578 --> 00:33:05.998
Then they fall at my feet.

00:33:05.998 --> 00:33:10.798
Why? I am not a stone idol that
hundreds of people should fall at my feet.

00:33:10.798 --> 00:33:13.851
Do not fall at my feet.

00:33:13.851 --> 00:33:16.808
Ok then ‘let me
offer some money.’ He offers ten paise.

00:33:16.808 --> 00:33:21.156
I said, ‘but Mataji does not accept money.’
‘At least take 25 paise.’

00:33:21.180 --> 00:33:25.796
They will not understand
what the current situation is,

00:33:25.820 --> 00:33:30.159
and in this situation Mataji
does not accept money

00:33:30.183 --> 00:33:34.488
and nobody should offer
money in God’s name.

00:33:34.488 --> 00:33:36.955
But it will not
penetrate their heads.

00:33:36.978 --> 00:33:38.385
‘How is it possible, Mataji?

00:33:38.385 --> 00:33:42.516
Everyone tells us that as you have lost
your mother, donate me a cow

00:33:42.540 --> 00:33:45.796
and how come you are not
accepting money from us?’

00:33:45.820 --> 00:33:49.773
So one should give up
this type of religious naivety.

00:33:49.797 --> 00:33:51.311
And how should this be done?

00:33:51.311 --> 00:33:56.008
Because the religion that
you have learnt, you have learnt it all wrong.

00:33:56.008 --> 00:33:58.439
What you call as religion, you learnt
it the wrong way

00:33:58.463 --> 00:34:02.248
Because you want to purchase religion
and there are sellers for this too.

00:34:02.248 --> 00:34:04.381
Dharma (religion)
cannot be sold.

00:34:04.385 --> 00:34:07.888
There are
people who sell and you purchase it.

00:34:07.888 --> 00:34:10.448
Means all three
things are in error.

00:34:10.448 --> 00:34:16.088
In the present
times, you have achieved self realization.

00:34:16.088 --> 00:34:19.208
Whatever you need to do,
is to be done on the strength of your atma.

00:34:19.208 --> 00:34:21.931
Instead, you
still pursue the practices of the past.

00:34:21.931 --> 00:34:24.756
‘This is our upbringing, Mataji’
‘Terrific.’

00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:27.516
Now a stone is placed on the road,

00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:31.728
shendur (red lead or vermillion powder) is
applied to the stone etc.etc. Someone sits there.

00:34:31.728 --> 00:34:36.288
Says – offer two paise,
four paise to the God.

00:34:36.288 --> 00:34:42.225
If any person passes by, he thinks
it’s for religion so let’s offer two paise.

00:34:42.225 --> 00:34:44.545
Come on!! You are Sahaja
Yogis. Why are you offering?

00:34:44.545 --> 00:34:47.219
‘Now Mataji, It is like this. We
have been brought up this way.’

00:34:47.243 --> 00:34:49.728
What sort of misguided values these are?

00:34:49.728 --> 00:34:52.528
Why do you offer?
Is it a God?

00:34:52.528 --> 00:34:54.518
Any Tom Dick
and Harry will place a stone, is it God?

00:34:54.518 --> 00:35:00.865
All such misguided
values within us will have to be removed.

00:35:00.865 --> 00:35:04.248
These can be removed only in one
way. Knowing what current situation is.

00:35:04.248 --> 00:35:07.276
Otherwise, they will say,’
We believe in Ram’

00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:10.688
But now it is not Ram, it is me.
Listen to me.

00:35:10.688 --> 00:35:14.568
Why to believe in Ram?
Because they can manipulate HIM.

00:35:14.568 --> 00:35:19.488
Behave the way you want, consume liquor
and say that I am Rama’s devotee. Great.

00:35:19.488 --> 00:35:24.168
Ram is not going to question you.
But if you are my devotee then I will ask.

00:35:24.168 --> 00:35:26.025
That is why they
are apprehensive.

00:35:26.025 --> 00:35:33.208
Oh no, no worshipping of Mataji – Because
Mataji is still alive. Will see after she takes nirakar form.

00:35:33.208 --> 00:35:37.785
No need to have faith till
she is alive as living persons question!

00:35:37.785 --> 00:35:41.113
They take to task-
Why did you behave in this manner?

00:35:41.131 --> 00:35:42.305
Have you understood?

00:35:42.305 --> 00:35:46.356
Whatever Old fashioned beliefs
the people from rural areas have,

00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:50.805
you will realize how much of these are true and
how much are false when you embrace Sahaja Yoga.

00:35:50.805 --> 00:35:55.968
So we must realize that
as a result we have become very rotten.

00:35:55.968 --> 00:35:59.648
Not old fashioned.
Have decayed!

00:35:59.648 --> 00:36:05.076
So whatever beliefs we have about ourselves,
whatever thoughts we have about religion

00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:08.125
these should also be examined.

00:36:08.125 --> 00:36:10.306
Now if you get rid of this, then there
is another one

00:36:10.330 --> 00:36:13.596
that we have become modern now.

00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:14.705
Is that so?

00:36:14.705 --> 00:36:16.145
What does it mean?

00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:19.488
We will not apply oils
to our heads as we have become modern.

00:36:19.488 --> 00:36:23.118
Becoming modern
means singing some obscene songs.

00:36:23.118 --> 00:36:25.651
Sing filthy songs
in front of Ganapati.

00:36:25.678 --> 00:36:28.958
What can we say?
They have become modern now!

00:36:28.958 --> 00:36:31.291
Then they will say that we
 don’t believe in God.

00:36:31.291 --> 00:36:32.768
This is being modern.

00:36:32.768 --> 00:36:36.528
Means some got wasted due to that
and some due to this.

00:36:36.528 --> 00:36:37.928
What is the reason for this.

00:36:37.928 --> 00:36:45.538
Now a days kids observe their parents
are going, madly chanting Hari Hari.

00:36:45.538 --> 00:36:49.888
They did this birth after birth
but what did they get.

00:36:49.888 --> 00:36:53.888
So many join the Varkari
Panth (cult) daily.

00:36:53.888 --> 00:36:56.698
I tried to make them understand so many times,
to stop making varys (pilgrimage to holy places).

00:36:56.698 --> 00:36:59.608
Receive right here what you wished
to get by making these pilgrimages.

00:36:59.608 --> 00:37:01.248
They do not understand this.

00:37:01.248 --> 00:37:05.048
It’s like being intoxicated on something.

00:37:05.048 --> 00:37:07.688
All of them go like a herd.

00:37:07.688 --> 00:37:09.208
Please accept this.

00:37:09.208 --> 00:37:10.451
I have brought
everything for you.

00:37:10.451 --> 00:37:11.608
Why don’t you take it?

00:37:11.608 --> 00:37:14.065
This will not come
in their heads at all.

00:37:14.065 --> 00:37:17.113
‘But Mataji, our ancestors did the same thing.’

00:37:17.137 --> 00:37:22.088
‘Whatever they have done, the virtue
they have garnered, just take its benefits.

00:37:22.088 --> 00:37:24.636
Are you still accumulating the holy deeds?’

00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:28.859
What is the situation today?

00:37:28.883 --> 00:37:32.968
In the present era, Sahaja Yoga is the
religion; we should accept this religion.

00:37:32.968 --> 00:37:36.236
We should embrace this religion

00:37:36.260 --> 00:37:39.888
and by establishing ourselves in
this religion we should purify ourselves.

00:37:39.888 --> 00:37:44.168
Sahaja Yoga is the
essence of all religions.

00:37:44.168 --> 00:37:47.608
We believe in all religions,
not only in one religion.

00:37:47.608 --> 00:37:49.733
Because if you follow only one religion,

00:37:49.757 --> 00:37:51.328
it would mean that I am very good
and you are bad.

00:37:51.328 --> 00:37:53.651
That’s it, then start fighting.

00:37:53.651 --> 00:37:58.036
But if you learn to appreciate
the good things in all religions,

00:37:58.060 --> 00:38:00.986
then you will not fight.

00:38:01.010 --> 00:38:05.968
It is well known in Maharashtra
that family disputes &amp; attachments are very common.

00:38:05.968 --> 00:38:08.225
What is the reason behind it?

00:38:08.225 --> 00:38:13.928
The reason is that we
recollect undesirable things.

00:38:13.928 --> 00:38:17.448
We recollect unwanted things.

00:38:17.448 --> 00:38:20.373
If someone says
leave it now,

00:38:20.397 --> 00:38:22.808
then ‘What are you telling!
Leave it? How come?

00:38:22.808 --> 00:38:25.813
This is a very old dispute, how
can it be set aside?’

00:38:25.837 --> 00:38:29.957
Whatever that is oldish ;
we still cling to it and behave this way.

00:38:29.957 --> 00:38:31.970
Now family disputes or attachments are old things

00:38:31.970 --> 00:38:34.757
Leave them aside,
they are of no use.

00:38:34.757 --> 00:38:37.631
What
benefits did Maharashtra get from it?

00:38:37.631 --> 00:38:43.171
Now when I see our rural areas, I have
a feeling that the situation is serious.

00:38:43.171 --> 00:38:46.206
those who become modern, are indulging into drinking habits

00:38:46.230 --> 00:38:48.585
if not they get wasted in this way.

00:38:48.585 --> 00:38:51.488
So where does one
start Sahaja Yoga?

00:38:51.488 --> 00:38:57.368
You cannot find even four
people who will understand these things.

00:38:57.368 --> 00:39:00.958
That is why I
say, protect your kids.

00:39:00.958 --> 00:39:03.591
At least take care of them.

00:39:03.591 --> 00:39:09.208
Tell them that without thinking
of past and future think of the present.

00:39:09.208 --> 00:39:11.018
This will bring
prosperity as well.

00:39:11.018 --> 00:39:15.625
If you are alert about
the present then prosperity will follow.

00:39:15.625 --> 00:39:19.996
To think of future is to build castles in
air, is not correct

00:39:20.020 --> 00:39:24.368
and to think of the past that has
immobilized you is also not correct.

00:39:24.368 --> 00:39:31.111
Hence you should come in the centre, should come
on the middle path, and should achieve balance.

00:39:31.111 --> 00:39:35.048
When you achieve a balanced state, you will see how
you become empowered and how much you can accomplish.

00:39:35.048 --> 00:39:37.765
Maharashtra is full of vibrations

00:39:37.765 --> 00:39:39.345
Because the worlds’ Kundalini is here.

00:39:39.345 --> 00:39:42.168
I am tired of explaining the
people from Maharashtra.

00:39:42.168 --> 00:39:44.358
They do not listen
to my counsel on this.

00:39:44.358 --> 00:39:46.568
They simply can’t
understand this thing.

00:39:46.568 --> 00:39:49.973
I am still so surprised that I am in
London

00:39:49.997 --> 00:39:53.730
and I keep on getting letters from Maharashtra.
This fellow is like this, that fellow is like that.

00:39:53.730 --> 00:39:57.408
I am sick of this and
I have closed my eyes.

00:39:57.408 --> 00:39:59.808
No end to this.

00:39:59.808 --> 00:40:02.768
People cannot see
good qualities in others.

00:40:02.768 --> 00:40:05.688
Actually all these people
are Sahaja Yogis.

00:40:05.688 --> 00:40:08.128
This is surprising.

00:40:08.128 --> 00:40:13.116
If Sahaja Yoga continues this way, tell me
what the Sadhus and saints will think about it?

00:40:13.140 --> 00:40:15.779
I came here to fulfill their tasks,

00:40:15.803 --> 00:40:20.445
took birth in your Maharashtra, I know
Marathi Language – everything is there ,

00:40:20.445 --> 00:40:24.351
still people do not understand what a
great thing I have brought.

00:40:24.351 --> 00:40:27.008
These people are here
from 55 countries.

00:40:27.008 --> 00:40:29.768
They came to this country.

00:40:29.768 --> 00:40:32.888
But what’s the use?

00:40:32.888 --> 00:40:34.871
Does it have any effect on you?

00:40:34.871 --> 00:40:37.358
Do you observe what
sort of people they are?

00:40:37.358 --> 00:40:39.458
They came to your
country from abroad.

00:40:39.458 --> 00:40:42.838
Why they are here,
What they have come for, do you see this?

00:40:42.838 --> 00:40:44.236
What do they do?

00:40:44.260 --> 00:40:46.888
What are they so joyous about?

00:40:46.888 --> 00:40:47.965
What have they achieved?

00:40:47.965 --> 00:40:49.516
We should also achieve likewise;

00:40:49.540 --> 00:40:55.906
this thought should come to
a normal and mature person.

00:40:55.930 --> 00:41:00.698
To have this understanding,
do only one thing.

00:41:00.698 --> 00:41:03.808
Today we are sitting here, what should we do today?

00:41:03.808 --> 00:41:06.098
What should be done right now?
What should be done at this time?

00:41:06.098 --> 00:41:07.778
What is this time for?

00:41:07.848 --> 00:41:09.688
This time itself is important.

00:41:09.688 --> 00:41:11.568
and that is what people don’t understand.

00:41:11.568 --> 00:41:13.088
That is why the confusion.

00:41:13.088 --> 00:41:17.288
So today, after remembering Ganesha,
we make a resolve in our minds

00:41:17.288 --> 00:41:21.968
that we will
live in the present.

00:41:21.968 --> 00:41:27.288
I find it difficult when
I shift from one language to another.

00:41:27.288 --> 00:41:28.851
But I speak flawlessly
in one language.

00:41:28.851 --> 00:41:31.625
If I change the language
then it is difficult for me to changeover.

00:41:31.625 --> 00:41:35.618
If, while speaking in Hindi, someone asks to speak
in Marathi, then I fumble; from one to other.

00:41:35.618 --> 00:41:37.885
Then I keep on
searching for words.

00:41:37.928 --> 00:41:42.088
Because everything is pure; it has to be pure;
Can’t mix things.

00:41:42.128 --> 00:41:44.661
Even in language,
one must be flawless.

00:41:44.718 --> 00:41:46.928
That is why I cannot do that.

00:41:46.928 --> 00:41:49.328
We must have
such purity in our lives.

00:41:49.328 --> 00:41:52.688
And that can be achieved only by one thing
that is, what am I doing at this time?

00:41:52.688 --> 00:41:54.605
What am I thinking at this time?

00:41:54.605 --> 00:41:58.111
Even if you pay the slightest attention,
everything will change instantaneously.

00:41:58.111 --> 00:42:02.916
You will be surprised, you will get rid of
your habits, and everything will fall in place.

00:42:02.940 --> 00:42:07.248
The only thing that matters is,” what
am I doing at this time?”

00:42:07.260 --> 00:42:11.607
Do not feel bad about
what I say, I am the mother.

00:42:11.607 --> 00:42:13.340
I have told you the truth.

00:42:13.367 --> 00:42:15.833
Understand this
and improve your life.

00:42:15.860 --> 00:42:18.140
What is the condition
of our life today?

00:42:18.140 --> 00:42:23.367
How sad is the condition of our kids; that
should be seen, should pay attention to that.

00:42:23.367 --> 00:42:25.818
I am definitely going to come back.

00:42:25.818 --> 00:42:27.088
Come back again
and again to Shere.

00:42:27.088 --> 00:42:30.158
Let at least Shere
village be uplifted.

00:42:30.158 --> 00:42:32.368
You all should help me in that.

00:42:32.368 --> 00:42:36.728
Adopt Sahaja Yoga and work hard.

00:42:36.728 --> 00:42:46.248
I will activate your Kundalini, but after activation
you need to set it properly with effort and diligence.

00:42:46.248 --> 00:42:49.236
So many people from other
countries got their realization,

00:42:49.260 --> 00:42:51.049
people who did not even know the name of
Ganapati,

00:42:51.073 --> 00:42:52.768
did not know the G of Ganapati.

00:42:52.768 --> 00:42:55.718
The mother earth
has placed the Ashta Vinaykas here.

00:42:55.718 --> 00:42:59.728
We should see what we do, what our
state is – should focus on these things.

00:42:59.728 --> 00:43:13.098
This is a very important thing
that itself is going to bless our country.

00:43:13.098 --> 00:43:15.448
But first of all
at least bless yourself.

00:43:15.448 --> 00:43:17.608
It is so easy.

00:43:17.608 --> 00:43:19.918
Look how easy it is.

00:43:19.918 --> 00:43:23.071
I have not asked you to perform a difficult task
like standing on your head or go to the Himalayas.

00:43:23.071 --> 00:43:24.728
Nothing like that.
It’s a simple achievable thing.

00:43:24.728 --> 00:43:26.011
Do Sahaja Yoga.

00:43:26.011 --> 00:43:29.871
First get your Kundalini
activated and learn to live in the present.

00:43:29.871 --> 00:43:30.891
That’s it.

00:43:30.891 --> 00:43:32.718
Then I will see what happens.

00:43:32.718 --> 00:43:39.031
Hope that next time there will be no quarrels and everything
will be hunky dory and people will behave themselves.

00:43:39.031 --> 00:43:55.168
My eternal blessings to you all.
