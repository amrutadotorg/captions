00:03.240 --> 00:13.230
It’s nice to come back to America....now
there are lots of seekers in this country;

00:13.230 --> 00:14.230
lost.

00:14.230 --> 00:17.330
They are frantically seeking, no doubt.

00:17.330 --> 00:23.650
The are genuine seekers,...ave no doubt about
it....ame back after...ears; it was unfortunate

00:23.650 --> 00:28.710
because...as busy with other parts of the
world and...new I’d find them again when...ame

00:28.710 --> 00:29.710
back.

00:29.710 --> 00:41.720
It is for us to know first of all that if
you are seeking reality, if you are seeking

00:41.720 --> 00:51.290
the truth, we have to be very honest about
it; extremely honest.

00:51.290 --> 01:02.410
You have to know that unless and until you
find it, you should not believe anyone., You

01:02.410 --> 01:06.020
should nbot accept any surface anything.

01:06.020 --> 01:16.619
People may say anything....ay tell you that
you have to have your realization.

01:16.619 --> 01:28.039
That doesn’t mean that you have to believe
me...t doesn’t mean that at all.

01:28.039 --> 01:33.749
But you should not also deny me.

01:33.749 --> 01:43.810
Now, first of all we should know what we are
seeking.

01:43.810 --> 01:53.630
There has been never on this earth such an
urge to seek.

01:53.630 --> 02:00.930
So many seekers!...on’t know if you understand
that...eally different type of category of

02:00.930 --> 02:01.930
people...

02:01.930 --> 02:07.100
call them men of God...re born who are seekers.

02:07.100 --> 02:14.560
And they will go on seeking until they find
the truth.

02:14.560 --> 02:21.740
But one has to know what we are seeking.

02:21.740 --> 02:24.860
What are we to seek?

02:24.860 --> 02:31.190
It is said you have to become.

02:31.190 --> 02:34.490
You have to be.

02:34.490 --> 02:39.440
What do we have to be?

02:39.440 --> 02:45.200
We have to be our Spirit.

02:45.200 --> 02:53.960
Now we do not know what our Spirit is.

02:53.960 --> 02:59.010
The Spirit exists, no doubt.

02:59.010 --> 03:00.460
It watches us.

03:00.460 --> 03:03.370
We know there is...pirit.

03:03.370 --> 03:13.570
But how to bring that Spirit into our conscious
mind...nto our central nervous system...s

03:13.570 --> 03:18.590
the point.

03:18.590 --> 03:31.960
And when people know that there are such demands,
the market also gets filled with enterprise...s

03:31.960 --> 03:33.630
very common.

03:33.630 --> 03:42.280
Americans have the worst hit because you have
worse...ou have money.

03:42.280 --> 03:44.730
That is the worst part of it.

03:44.730 --> 03:55.520
And that’s how all of them are different
down here and they have exploited you.

03:55.520 --> 03:59.290
I’m sorry for all that.

03:59.290 --> 04:06.830
But...ust tell you that you cannot pay for
your realization.

04:06.830 --> 04:10.600
It’s an insult of God.

04:10.600 --> 04:13.620
How can you pay?

04:13.620 --> 04:18.900
How can you p[ay for His love?

04:18.900 --> 04:25.680
Do you pay to...ree when it gives you fruit?

04:25.680 --> 04:29.259
You do not.

04:29.259 --> 04:34.509
Maybe...erchant might take...ruit and settle.

04:34.509 --> 04:37.129
It’s much more than that.

04:37.129 --> 04:40.270
“How can we pay for it?”

04:40.270 --> 04:43.939
Is...imple question we should ask ourselves;
honestly.

04:43.939 --> 04:50.550
Then second point is, you cannot have courses
in God realization.

04:50.550 --> 04:55.800
What university did Christ go?

04:55.800 --> 04:58.939
He was...imple man.

04:58.939 --> 05:05.240
Did he go to any university?

05:05.240 --> 05:08.810
There is no understanding for us.

05:08.810 --> 05:14.219
That God is for everyone, whether you are
rich people or not.

05:14.219 --> 05:16.410
Whether you understand this language or that
language, God’s language is of love and

05:16.410 --> 05:17.509
it’s for everyone…

05:17.509 --> 05:18.990
every person….for every case.

05:18.990 --> 05:27.129
It cannot be for one person or one type of
people or of one category.

05:27.129 --> 05:33.480
But one category is there and they are the
seekers.

05:33.480 --> 05:43.650
Seekers is...pecial category; but only trouble
is they do not know what they are seeking.

05:43.650 --> 05:51.749
For this we have to divert to some authentic
people.

05:51.749 --> 05:55.180
For example, we should see now Christ.

05:55.180 --> 05:59.199
Christ said that you are to be born again.

05:59.199 --> 06:06.900
Last time, when...ame to America, they were
taping my speeches and all that in Los Angeles.

06:06.900 --> 06:17.020
And...as amazed, you see, that poeple objected
to it; felt they should not tape....aid, “Let

06:17.020 --> 06:18.550
them tape.

06:18.550 --> 06:21.610
What does it matter?”

06:21.610 --> 06:27.729
They said, “No Mother, they will publish
it."

06:27.729 --> 06:31.559
...aid, “Let them publish it.

06:31.559 --> 06:32.559
It’s...act.

06:32.559 --> 06:34.599
They should get it.

06:34.599 --> 06:37.680
They should get their relization.

06:37.680 --> 06:40.009
They are to be born again."

06:40.009 --> 06:41.009
But...as amazed!

06:41.009 --> 06:54.490
Then, they write books as if that was their
knowledge....on’t mind that either.

06:54.490 --> 07:11.259
But saying that you are to be born again and
they got...ertificate...

07:11.259 --> 07:14.059
sales certificate...hat we are born again.

07:14.059 --> 07:18.210
How can you certify yourslf you are born again?

07:18.210 --> 07:21.660
You have to be honest about it.

07:21.660 --> 07:29.069
If you are born again something special has
to happen to us.

07:29.069 --> 07:30.939
Like Jung has said that you have to become...ecome
collectively conscious.

07:30.939 --> 07:36.839
Not that...ay we are all brothers and sisters
and we are all one.

07:36.839 --> 07:43.610
No, you have to become that part and parcel
of the whole...s you say the microcosm.

07:43.610 --> 07:47.520
You have to become this microcosm...as to
become that.

07:47.520 --> 07:53.650
That means in evolution, your awareness has
to become something more.

07:53.650 --> 07:58.900
As an animal you see, for example, for an
animal.

07:58.900 --> 08:01.750
He doesn’t see any colors.

08:01.750 --> 08:06.259
He doesn’t see whether is filthy or good.

08:06.259 --> 08:08.099
But you do.

08:08.099 --> 08:20.020
I’m the same way, if you have to rise higher,
the change has to come in your awareness.

08:20.020 --> 08:28.819
That is one thing one should know...hat the
transformation has to take place in your awareness.

08:28.819 --> 08:34.260
And that is what one should see.

08:34.260 --> 08:37.639
Is there any transformation in awareness?

08:37.639 --> 08:44.610
For example, there is some lady who starts
jumping on the seat.

08:44.610 --> 08:48.339
I’ve seen some poeple who come to me.

08:48.339 --> 09:02.250
They just start jumping and they think they
have got realization.

09:02.250 --> 09:06.370
How can that be?

09:06.370 --> 09:14.570
You are not in possession of yourself.

09:14.570 --> 09:20.100
You have to be your own master.

09:20.100 --> 09:29.990
Here somebody is making you jump.

09:29.990 --> 09:38.480
Maybe you are possessed.You have not have
authority over yourself.

09:38.480 --> 09:44.350
You do not know how to control yourself.

09:44.350 --> 09:48.440
And how do you say that you have got realization?

09:48.440 --> 09:52.590
If you become self realized, you are not going
to be enslaved.

09:52.590 --> 09:57.290
You are going to get over all

09:57.290 --> 09:59.550
kinds of slavery.

09:59.550 --> 10:00.930
You have to be...aster.

10:00.930 --> 10:10.569
This should be the test of anything that you
are seeking.

10:10.569 --> 10:16.720
What have you got, you say?

10:16.720 --> 10:23.130
Are you emitting your own powers?...ay say
(as he has said it,...ean,...on’t know why

10:23.130 --> 10:30.680
Warren said this because...eldom start with
this kind of...hing); but if you wanted to

10:30.680 --> 10:32.069
see who said it.

10:32.069 --> 10:41.270
Now to say that...m such and such and such
and such is nonsense....ay be anything.

10:41.270 --> 10:42.930
So what?

10:42.930 --> 10:48.720
What did you get is the point!

10:48.720 --> 10:53.370
Did you feel yourself any more than before?

10:53.370 --> 11:00.079
Did you get anthing more than you have had
before?

11:00.079 --> 11:05.449
Not that you become crazy people or recluses.

11:05.449 --> 11:07.709
That’s not the way.

11:07.709 --> 11:14.430
You are going to become most normal person...as
to be extremely normal.

11:14.430 --> 11:20.360
And above all, you have to have complete control
of yourself.

11:20.360 --> 11:24.319
That is the minimum of minimums one should
know.

11:24.319 --> 11:34.899
But our idea about self realization is so
much spoiled and so many psuedo people have

11:34.899 --> 11:41.390
written., even about Kundalini....as amazed
when...ound out that such big, big books are

11:41.390 --> 11:42.390
written about Kundalini....

11:42.390 --> 11:49.670
saying it is in the stomache, some say it
is in the nose....

11:49.670 --> 11:53.629
it is here and there.

11:53.629 --> 11:57.100
It is not there!

11:57.100 --> 12:00.399
It is in the sacrum bone.

12:00.399 --> 12:04.720
You can see it yourself with your own eyes.

12:04.720 --> 12:09.670
When the Kundalini rises you can see the pulsation
just like...eart....

12:09.670 --> 12:13.070
not in everyone, of course.

12:13.070 --> 12:24.480
But in some poeple who have had an obstruction,
you can see with your naked eyes.

12:24.480 --> 12:35.240
You should be able to see it...appily...nd
you can also feel the pulsation coming to

12:35.240 --> 12:39.699
the head....ean so many pleople have said
it.

12:39.699 --> 12:50.399
There are people now,...m told, who are converting
people into Shikhism and this and that.

12:50.399 --> 12:54.600
And what is Shikhism?

12:54.600 --> 13:01.440
If you need...ead Kabir (sp ?) who is the
basis of Shikhism.

13:01.440 --> 13:10.250
He has said that you have to feel the cool
breeze coming out of your head.

13:10.250 --> 13:11.250
He says...

13:11.250 --> 13:13.470
(Mother quotes in another language).

13:13.470 --> 13:22.830
This means, on the head first of all, there
is the sound of Anahada, is this thub-dub

13:22.830 --> 13:29.589
of the heart and then you feel the cool breeze
coming out.

13:29.589 --> 13:35.520
Is so clearly said, but who reads those people?

13:35.520 --> 13:43.019
Those people who talk even of Hinduism and
all that, do they read Adi Shankaracharia?

13:43.019 --> 13:45.060
What Adi Shankaracharin has said?

13:45.060 --> 13:54.839
He has written books after books on Kundalini;
and not only, but on this Chaintanyita (sp?)

13:54.839 --> 13:56.449
he has written...omplete book.

13:56.449 --> 13:58.329
But people don’t read that.

13:58.329 --> 13:59.610
You get these...

13:59.610 --> 14:07.879
don’t know...xtracts and some sort of...on’t
know how they are not afraid of God?

14:07.879 --> 14:13.629
They are not afraid...ust to make some money...

14:13.629 --> 14:15.079
don’t know.

14:15.079 --> 14:22.930
Are they going to carry this money with them?

14:22.930 --> 14:27.329
It’s very, very wrong!

14:27.329 --> 14:36.120
It’s very sinful....on’t mind what ever
they do.

14:36.120 --> 14:47.110
It’s alright if they want to be smugglers
and all.

14:47.110 --> 14:52.610
There are many like that.

14:52.610 --> 14:58.110
But they spoil your Kundalini.

14:58.110 --> 14:59.319
You are damaged.

14:59.319 --> 15:03.490
And this is the thing which...m concernd about.

15:03.490 --> 15:05.000
It’s...ery sad thing.

15:05.000 --> 15:08.910
Coming to America is...eal _____?

15:08.910 --> 15:15.959
for me because...id send some of the people
who were really realized sould and they came

15:15.959 --> 15:16.959
here.

15:16.959 --> 15:18.870
They ran away within...ays.

15:18.870 --> 15:24.110
They said they will never recognize us...here
is...arrier...here is...arrier.

15:24.110 --> 15:27.020
They will never recognize Mother.

15:27.020 --> 15:28.760
They rushed back.

15:28.760 --> 15:33.720
They stayed in New York, one of them stayed.

15:33.720 --> 15:35.610
He ran away.

15:35.610 --> 15:38.139
He couldn’t stand it.

15:38.139 --> 15:42.570
He said, “They just want something else.

15:42.570 --> 15:45.089
They don’t want Ìod.

15:45.089 --> 15:48.260
They don’t want their spirit."

15:48.260 --> 15:50.899
Of course,...on’t believe that.

15:50.899 --> 15:59.129
These barriers are created to us because we
read about it.

15:59.129 --> 16:03.620
We try to understand through reading.

16:03.620 --> 16:14.339
It’s good, but you must come to...ight conclusion
through logical, logical understanding; not

16:14.339 --> 16:15.339
rationality.

16:15.339 --> 16:21.490
Rationality is something which can take you
anywhere.

16:21.490 --> 16:25.120
Rationality can give you...you can) rationalize
even...urder...nything!

16:25.120 --> 16:29.329
But, logically, you must understnd.

16:29.329 --> 16:35.480
Where should we reach?

16:35.480 --> 16:40.649
What should happen to us?

16:40.649 --> 16:43.420
As seekers, what are we expecting?

16:43.420 --> 16:49.639
This is...ery, very precarious and important
time...s more to say.

16:49.639 --> 16:52.600
The Last Judgement has started.

16:52.600 --> 16:54.769
That has started.

16:54.769 --> 17:02.339
That’s how you are all here and you are
seeking.

17:02.339 --> 17:09.339
The way it will judge, is the Kundalini has
to rise.

17:09.339 --> 17:12.640
Your have to become self realized.

17:12.640 --> 17:16.179
Then you start feeling your centers on your
fingers.

17:16.179 --> 17:27.110
Tomorrow...ill give you all the information
about the centers and all that and...ill tell

17:27.110 --> 17:31.070
you how He will judge you.

17:31.070 --> 17:35.690
What are your centers that are catching?

17:35.690 --> 17:47.200
And then you will judge that and you will
know what is the problem....

17:47.200 --> 17:53.230
how to get it done...ow to get it alright.

17:53.230 --> 17:57.270
There is no technique for _____?...ike if
you sow...eed it becomes...ree.

17:57.270 --> 17:59.299
There is no technique.

17:59.299 --> 18:02.350
If you have flowers, they become...ruit.

18:02.350 --> 18:03.620
It’s...iving thing.

18:03.620 --> 18:08.070
And living things don’t have any technique.

18:08.070 --> 18:19.120
But once you get connected, then you must
know the Divine laws and you must know the

18:19.120 --> 18:20.360
Divine technique.

18:20.360 --> 18:24.080
But first you must be realized.

18:24.080 --> 18:30.350
Unless and until you are put to the Mains,
how can you use this machine¿ You are not

18:30.350 --> 18:32.100
yet put to the Mains.

18:32.100 --> 18:34.100
How can you do anything?

18:34.100 --> 18:40.270
It’s like telephoning somewhere without
having connection.

18:40.270 --> 18:51.170
You must be connected., first of all to the
Divine.( but this is not...ifficult thing.).

18:51.170 --> 18:54.640
In modern times is very easy.

18:54.640 --> 19:00.900
Formerly, it was, like you can say,...ree.

19:00.900 --> 19:04.770
In the beginning you get only one or two flowers.

19:04.770 --> 19:08.799
But the time has come.

19:08.799 --> 19:11.179
The blossom time has come.

19:11.179 --> 19:15.850
Already today,...ent to see William Blake’s
drawing exhibition.

19:15.850 --> 19:22.410
And he said, “All your sins and blasphemy
and everything will be forgiven.

19:22.410 --> 19:25.700
All your sins will be forgiven."

19:25.700 --> 19:29.320
He has said about these days.

19:29.320 --> 19:38.520
He said that the God of _____?

19:38.520 --> 19:53.210
will become prophets and they will have power
to convert and transform others into prophets.

19:53.210 --> 19:57.110
He has clearly prophesized about Sahaja Yoga.

19:57.110 --> 20:01.010
Every word he has said about it.

20:01.010 --> 20:03.800
But people don’t read Blake.

20:03.800 --> 20:05.480
If you go

20:05.480 --> 20:12.280
and see his exhibition, you’ll be surprised
how in the “Pilgrim’s Progress” only

20:12.280 --> 20:18.370
he has given clearly how you face life.

20:18.370 --> 20:25.740
And there are some Sahjaja Yogis here sitting
down at your back here.

20:25.740 --> 20:30.649
And they have come from London and some of
them from Australia.

20:30.649 --> 20:31.649
And they could see.

20:31.649 --> 20:33.510
This is how you face it.

20:33.510 --> 20:40.670
But to get realization is the easiest thing;
to maintain it...ather difficult.

20:40.670 --> 20:43.900
But also that is possible.

20:43.900 --> 20:56.260
Now we have in London (you will be surprised)...all
at least one and one-half times bigger than

20:56.260 --> 20:57.410
this.

20:57.410 --> 21:00.560
And the hall was completely filled.

21:00.560 --> 21:05.240
And they rose up to sing...ong of Jeruseleum
which was...reat experience for me to see

21:05.240 --> 21:06.240
that.

21:06.240 --> 21:12.800
But( you won’t believe)...tarted the work
in England because my husband got elected

21:12.800 --> 21:14.150
to...ost there.

21:14.150 --> 21:17.510
That’s how we were there.

21:17.510 --> 21:22.560
And in the beginning,...as working with seven
people...even hippies,...hould say...even

21:22.560 --> 21:24.250
people for four years.

21:24.250 --> 21:36.330
And now of course, in the whole of England
we have many centers and lots of people have

21:36.330 --> 21:40.350
got realization and they are working it out.

21:40.350 --> 21:43.510
It’s working out very well.

21:43.510 --> 21:49.830
We have some people here from there who have
come.

21:49.830 --> 21:50.830
Dr.

21:50.830 --> 21:54.890
David is here and Hesta is...arrister.

21:54.890 --> 21:59.280
Then we have these two from Australia...r.

21:59.280 --> 22:01.210
Warren, who was...iplomat.

22:01.210 --> 22:08.610
And these two are American girls...oth of
them...h Christine...as been with me since

22:08.610 --> 22:17.750
long and Marcia who got her realization only
two months back, but she was so upright and

22:17.750 --> 22:20.120
so straight forward.

22:20.120 --> 22:26.020
And you should know that it is you who should
decide.

22:26.020 --> 22:31.010
If you say...m your Guru, alright...ccept
it for the time being.

22:31.010 --> 22:36.539
But...other is always...uru.

22:36.539 --> 22:51.400
If you say that your mother had to teach you
so many things...lso...ave to teach you some

22:51.400 --> 22:52.400
things.

22:52.400 --> 23:01.840
But actually, it is you who is your own guru.

23:01.840 --> 23:03.429
You have to become it.

23:03.429 --> 23:09.200
Unless and until you are connected, how will
you judge?

23:09.200 --> 23:13.980
Once you get connected, you will be able to
check.

23:13.980 --> 23:24.750
But you don’t think it is...ental activity
that is going to bring you your realization.

23:24.750 --> 23:28.860
No, God has placed everything beautifully
within us...verything.

23:28.860 --> 23:39.399
You have got your Kundalini very nicely placed
in the sacrum bone.

23:39.399 --> 23:41.700
Now, see this bone.

23:41.700 --> 23:48.529
Sacrum is...riangular bone called “sacrum”
so that Greeks know about this bone.

23:48.529 --> 23:51.850
They knew it was...acred bone.

23:51.850 --> 23:54.100
Sacrum means sacred in Greek.

23:54.100 --> 23:55.899
When...ent to Greece,...as surprised.

23:55.899 --> 23:59.950
They have the complete idea of kundalini;
complete idea.

23:59.950 --> 24:05.470
And they have this Athena also...eans the
Primordial Mother.

24:05.470 --> 24:13.850
In Sanskrit language, Athena...thens comes
from that and the way She was holding...erpent

24:13.850 --> 24:24.240
in her hand and everything...bsolutely She
is the Primordial Kundalini.

24:24.240 --> 24:37.190
And the whole concept was there and when...ent
into the study of that...ried to find out

24:37.190 --> 24:38.990
what it was....

24:38.990 --> 24:41.399
how did they know?

24:41.399 --> 24:49.390
They said we had some Indo-Aryian groups coming
down here and they told us these things and

24:49.390 --> 24:51.760
that’s how they know about it.

24:51.760 --> 24:55.240
But, that was all lost

24:55.240 --> 25:03.200
because they brought all the Gods to the level
of human beings and made alot of mess out

25:03.200 --> 25:04.230
of it.

25:04.230 --> 25:11.960
Now we have to know that how Christ was such
an important incarnation on this earth.

25:11.960 --> 25:16.420
We have really made...ess of the whole thing.

25:16.420 --> 25:21.640
He said that you are to be born again.

25:21.640 --> 25:27.299
Actually, he came on this center where you
see this red mark.

25:27.299 --> 25:31.670
You see...t is placed in the optic chiasma.

25:31.670 --> 25:36.510
In the center is...ubtle center called as
Agnya chakra.

25:36.510 --> 25:41.040
In the Hindu scriptures, He is called as Mahavishnu.

25:41.040 --> 25:47.010
But...ill tell about His advent when He came
on this earth.

25:47.010 --> 25:52.430
We say, He is the gate; he is the door.

25:52.430 --> 25:59.980
He is the door below the limbic area.

25:59.980 --> 26:06.450
And the limbic area is the Kingdom of God.

26:06.450 --> 26:10.680
Where one has to center, the attention has
to enter.

26:10.680 --> 26:16.170
How you enter into it...ot bodily, but your
attention has to enter it.

26:16.170 --> 26:18.910
Your attention is apread out in this area.

26:18.910 --> 26:32.000
But not there...t has to enter through that
area into the limbic area and ultimately,

26:32.000 --> 26:35.429
is the fontanel area.

26:35.429 --> 26:48.510
It becomes soft and the kundalini has to come
out and with the cool breeze, this is your

26:48.510 --> 26:50.059
actual baptism.

26:50.059 --> 26:58.010
Is not the baptism you go to some theological
college to learn and say alright...

26:58.010 --> 26:59.159
baptize...t’s all artifical.

26:59.159 --> 27:00.320
It’s absolutely artificial.

27:00.320 --> 27:12.760
That’s not the way you can baptize.

27:12.760 --> 27:16.110
You have to be...ealized soul to do that.

27:16.110 --> 27:19.770
John the Baptist was...ealized soul.

27:19.770 --> 27:26.990
He was the one who knew how to do it.

27:26.990 --> 27:30.399
And he did it for all of them.

27:30.399 --> 27:33.450
And that’s how it should happen to you.

27:33.450 --> 27:36.540
The kundalini has to rise and give you realization.

27:36.540 --> 27:41.210
Now the Christ advent came at this point.

27:41.210 --> 27:48.110
It’s...ery important one because today we
have brought the charts and all that but tomorrow

27:48.110 --> 27:54.789
we’ll be giving you, in...ull way, how the
ego and super-ego are sucked.

27:54.789 --> 27:57.320
They create...arrier here.

27:57.320 --> 28:01.990
Our ego and super-ego gives us our I-ness.

28:01.990 --> 28:03.769
We get seperated.

28:03.769 --> 28:10.730
When He’s awakened, this portion gets opened
out and then the kundalini can rise.

28:10.730 --> 28:15.830
That’s why it is said, Christ is to be awakened
within you.

28:15.830 --> 28:21.190
But it can be only done by...erson with Divine
authority.

28:21.190 --> 28:22.549
And such...erson cannot live on your money.

28:22.549 --> 28:23.549
He cannot be...arasite.

28:23.549 --> 28:25.160
Such...erson has nothing to do wioth money.

28:25.160 --> 28:27.409
How can you purchase such...erson.?

28:27.409 --> 28:29.639
Such...erson is beyond....

28:29.639 --> 28:33.370
beyond your purchase...eyond your money.

28:33.370 --> 28:36.830
You cannot do anything for such...erson.

28:36.830 --> 28:38.850
Such...erson just gives.

28:38.850 --> 28:40.870
He just gives.

28:40.870 --> 28:41.870
He emits.

28:41.870 --> 28:44.910
It cannot take anything.

28:44.910 --> 28:45.910
It cannot receive.

28:45.910 --> 28:47.309
It cannot!

28:47.309 --> 28:51.549
You may try, but doesn’t.

28:51.549 --> 29:01.250
One day...as walking...ittle bit, my foot
was...ittle twisted and one of the doctors

29:01.250 --> 29:10.159
she said, “Alright Mother, I’ll try to
massage it."

29:10.159 --> 29:20.549
Yet she was relaxing that side and...as saying,
“What’s happening to you?”

29:20.549 --> 29:23.070
She said, “Mother, what is this?

29:23.070 --> 29:31.049
Lots of vibrations are coming and...m just
massaging yourself and...m massaging myself....

29:31.049 --> 29:40.139
the way it is cooling down and soothing."

29:40.139 --> 29:45.279
So, such...erson cannot take anythging from
you.

29:45.279 --> 29:52.809
Now, the most important point which...ould
like to reach you is this: that we don’t

29:52.809 --> 29:56.080
realize hos precariously we are placed otherwise,
also.

29:56.080 --> 30:04.139
There are equal and opposite forces working
on us.

30:04.139 --> 30:11.590
For example,...isease like cancer....as surprised
to hear at this country, theere are patients...ne

30:11.590 --> 30:18.970
among four...f cancer disease....ave told
this ten years back, that cancer can only

30:18.970 --> 30:21.899
be cured through Sahaja Yoga.

30:21.899 --> 30:37.720
There’s no other way out....ave cured many
cancer patients and you can also cure once

30:37.720 --> 30:38.720
you get realized.

30:38.720 --> 30:44.269
How it happens...ow you cure cancer...ll this
knowledte you can have...ree of charge.

30:44.269 --> 30:46.940
Free of this thing.

30:46.940 --> 30:51.820
Actually, first you must get your realization.

30:51.820 --> 30:59.159
Without that, there is no use telling you
because you come into this room; it is all

30:59.159 --> 31:04.669
dark; you are blind; you cannot see anything.

31:04.669 --> 31:13.669
What’s the use telling you the size of the
room, and color of the chairs, and color of

31:13.669 --> 31:15.179
all this?

31:15.179 --> 31:18.210
No use telling you.

31:18.210 --> 31:26.990
Best thing is to open the lights and open
your eyes so that you can see for yourself.

31:26.990 --> 31:33.029
And the complete knowledge becomes your own.

31:33.029 --> 31:35.789
Then is better to talk.

31:35.789 --> 31:41.760
Otherwise supposing even though when you can’t
see,...o on giving you the complete history

31:41.760 --> 31:43.179
about electricity and about everything.

31:43.179 --> 31:44.610
You’ll be bored and stiff.

31:44.610 --> 31:46.040
And its of no use.

31:46.040 --> 31:49.070
First thing is you must get your realization.

31:49.070 --> 31:51.210
That is the first thing.

31:51.210 --> 31:54.640
Cancer can easily be cured by Sahaja Yoga.

31:54.640 --> 31:56.780
Absolustely there is no doubt.

31:56.780 --> 32:01.980
And there cannot be another doubt that it
cannot be cured by anything else.

32:01.980 --> 32:09.980
In our body, we have...articular system called
as...ympathetic nervous system.

32:09.980 --> 32:18.570
How this sympathetic nervous system goes into...errible
tension when we go to extremes of any kind.

32:18.570 --> 32:19.570
Say smoking, for example.

32:19.570 --> 32:20.570
Now smoking is...ery interesting thing.

32:20.570 --> 32:25.120
According to me, this America is the Visshuddi
chakra....

32:25.120 --> 32:29.010
is the center of this çenter.

32:29.010 --> 32:35.809
This center gets spoiked when we smoke and
the smoking is the maximum here.

32:35.809 --> 32:41.370
Like the Europe is the liver and there people
drink.

32:41.370 --> 32:48.450
And they are so much in it and their lives
are the worst of all in Europe.

32:48.450 --> 32:49.789
England is the heart.

32:49.789 --> 32:53.100
It (England) is lethargic....ean the whole
thing is in such...ess that...on’t know

32:53.100 --> 32:54.100
what...ave to face.

32:54.100 --> 32:56.409
But...as happy to know that now the smoking
is going down.

32:56.409 --> 32:58.230
But with realization, smoking just disappears.

32:58.230 --> 33:01.270
You don’t have to work at it.

33:01.270 --> 33:03.279
Marsha herself used to smoke alot.

33:03.279 --> 33:04.549
She told me....as amazed.

33:04.549 --> 33:06.460
But she has biven up completely.

33:06.460 --> 33:11.140
Drugs and all those things drop out just like
something unnecessary because...ransformation

33:11.140 --> 33:12.140
takes place.

33:12.140 --> 33:14.690
And the transmutation starts...hen the transmutation
starts, all these things drop out.

33:14.690 --> 33:19.850
You enjoy the best of health...est of your
heart...est of your miond....

33:19.850 --> 33:22.720
and your emotions come out.

33:22.720 --> 33:26.625
The best part of it is that this is what one
has to achieve....

33:26.625 --> 33:30.230
the whole humanity has to achieve.

33:30.230 --> 33:38.750
But the few who are the seekers have to do
it first.

33:38.750 --> 33:42.150
They have to do it first; they are the foundation.

33:42.150 --> 33:47.240
Like in every evolution, only...ew fishes
had to come out; then many came

33:47.240 --> 33:48.240
out.

33:48.240 --> 33:50.960
In the same way, few people have to do it.

33:50.960 --> 33:52.659
I’m happy there are...ew today.

33:52.659 --> 33:56.730
Though others are disappointed,...m not....m
happy because I’ll have to work harder.

33:56.730 --> 33:59.590
If there are too many, maybe difficult.

33:59.590 --> 34:05.419
As he said, it’s true that...ave realization
to six thousand people in...illage in India.

34:05.419 --> 34:06.850
But they are not complicated.

34:06.850 --> 34:08.290
See, they aren’t so complicated.

34:08.290 --> 34:15.419
They don’t live with the sorrows (word?)
you have here or the tensions you have....

34:15.419 --> 34:17.370
or the litigations you have....

34:17.370 --> 34:20.730
the problems you have....ave seen Indians
who have come here to earn money.

34:20.730 --> 34:24.320
They have all gone off their heads....ean
really, they have become half crazy.

34:24.320 --> 34:27.839
The gentleman with whom...m now putting up,
he told me already so many Indians have been

34:27.839 --> 34:28.839
under litigation.

34:28.839 --> 34:30.760
This happened, that happened and all kinds
of tensions are building up.

34:30.760 --> 34:33.940
Here, despite all our modern vest(word?) we
also have landed ourselves into terrible tensions

34:33.940 --> 34:37.009
of this machinery; this machinate and all
that.

34:37.009 --> 34:39.610
The villagers in India are extremely simple
people.

34:39.610 --> 34:41.840
They lead an extremely simple life.

34:41.840 --> 34:46.280
They have no complications....on’t say that
it would be so easy here as the way they have

34:46.280 --> 34:47.280
got realization.

34:47.280 --> 34:48.910
Of course, one has to work hard.

34:48.910 --> 34:54.550
Like we had about seven people....ad all of
them...t took about three hours to get realization.

34:54.550 --> 34:57.160
So, it could be that way also.

34:57.160 --> 35:00.680
It cannot be guaranteed; it cannot be promised.

35:00.680 --> 35:02.440
It cannot be certified.

35:02.440 --> 35:07.510
It has to happen...s the main point...s the
happening...s the happening.

35:07.510 --> 35:09.020
You have to become.

35:09.020 --> 35:10.900
It has to be actualized.

35:10.900 --> 35:14.349
It is not to be believed.

35:14.349 --> 35:17.829
That’s what you should know.

35:17.829 --> 35:21.130
If you are honest, you are to prove.

35:21.130 --> 35:25.069
And, you want to have it, you’ll get it.

35:25.069 --> 35:27.030
I’ll work very hard.

35:27.030 --> 35:32.609
It’s you who has to have patience with yourself....ave
all the patience and love.

35:32.609 --> 35:34.510
No doubt about it.

35:34.510 --> 35:39.349
But you all have to have patience....old you
seven people...as working for four years.

35:39.349 --> 35:45.280
Suppose its not going to be that bad, because
with them...orked out many permutations and

35:45.280 --> 35:46.280
combinations.

35:46.280 --> 35:51.250
Now,...now all the permutations and combinations
that are really harmful to people and how

35:51.250 --> 35:52.450
they are eradicated.

35:52.450 --> 35:55.650
But still...ould say...ould still have to
study some American complications which...o

35:55.650 --> 35:56.650
not know.

35:56.650 --> 36:03.099
Nine years back, people were simpler people
here and they are all mostly have gone away

36:03.099 --> 36:08.890
or also at that time the same thing is that...ould
not contact and everything works on money.

36:08.890 --> 36:14.900
You see you have to give them money so they
publisize you.

36:14.900 --> 36:18.710
Then they publisize you...hen you get more
money.

36:18.710 --> 36:22.990
Here there is no question of money, you see.

36:22.990 --> 36:30.820
You see my whole basic thing is you have to
get real people so the real thing, without

36:30.820 --> 36:31.820
money.

36:31.820 --> 36:36.610
And then, you cannot have...ig circus; you
cannot have...ig thing and it has to be started

36:36.610 --> 36:37.630
in...enuine way...n...eal way.

36:37.630 --> 36:43.380
They asked me that there is, there are agencies
who work out all these tings....aid to begin

36:43.380 --> 36:44.380
with...on’t think that

36:44.380 --> 36:45.380
this is important.

36:45.380 --> 36:47.450
We should work it out.

36:47.450 --> 36:48.450
Let’s see.

36:48.450 --> 36:52.890
There will be some people who feel attracted
and come.

36:52.890 --> 36:56.420
And let’s work it out this way.

36:56.420 --> 37:04.780
Still,...ould like your advice as to where
we can go, when, and in...ecent manner whenever

37:04.780 --> 37:05.780
we can advertise.

37:05.780 --> 37:12.550
Just now...ady told us that if you go to these
shops it will be good idea.

37:12.550 --> 37:14.690
We would like to invite people for this experience.

37:14.690 --> 37:15.690
This is your right.

37:15.690 --> 37:23.730
You are seekers and just like...ank, you have
got your bank accounts and you just cash it.

37:23.730 --> 37:34.210
And these are lots of places also.

37:34.210 --> 37:47.680
And whatever mistakes are done, don’t worry
about it.

37:47.680 --> 37:54.500
One of the big problems...aced in Englad is
that they all suffer from...enter or left

37:54.500 --> 37:56.700
visshuddi which comes out of guilt.

37:56.700 --> 37:58.300
You see, they are guilty all the time.

37:58.300 --> 38:01.680
Maybe Catholicism that makes them feel guilty,
but it’s...ery, very common trouble with

38:01.680 --> 38:02.680
them.

38:02.680 --> 38:03.680
They all the time feel guilty.

38:03.680 --> 38:05.069
Now, what are you feeling guilty for?

38:05.069 --> 38:06.069
We must suffer.

38:06.069 --> 38:07.069
Why?

38:07.069 --> 38:08.069
Why should you suffer?

38:08.069 --> 38:09.069
Christ has suffered for you.

38:09.069 --> 38:10.640
Did he leave anything for you to suffer?

38:10.640 --> 38:12.800
We whould be guilty about what?

38:12.800 --> 38:14.240
Why are you guilty?

38:14.240 --> 38:17.120
I’m talking of ocean of compassion...cean
of love.

38:17.120 --> 38:19.280
Now what guilt can you have?

38:19.280 --> 38:22.950
And is...ery big mistake to think that we
have done little mistake here and little mistake

38:22.950 --> 38:23.950
there.

38:23.950 --> 38:25.360
God has to save this creation.

38:25.360 --> 38:29.450
It is He who has to come in compassion and
has to do something about it.

38:29.450 --> 38:32.750
If He doesn’t save you, his creation is
lost.

38:32.750 --> 38:36.630
You shouldn’t feel like that inb...mall
way.

38:36.630 --> 38:41.970
It’s all very childish,...ould say, like...hild
to feel “Oow” after this mistake.

38:41.970 --> 38:59.839
But no...our Father is so great, is so full
of love you have to just look at Him and He’ll

38:59.839 --> 39:04.250
work it out.

39:04.250 --> 39:07.470
You should forgive yourself; that is one of
the things...ould request of you.

39:07.470 --> 39:11.510
First of all, before forgiving anybody else,
you must forgive yourself.

39:11.510 --> 39:15.380
That is the first thing you have to do before
realization.

39:15.380 --> 39:18.880
Of course, in one lecture,...annot tell you
much about it.

39:18.880 --> 39:20.990
This is just an introductory lecture.

39:20.990 --> 39:29.390
And we haven’t got our charts and all that
because first day, if you start seeing the

39:29.390 --> 39:33.040
charts, you (word?) mechanical and you think
it’s some sort of...omputer.

39:33.040 --> 39:34.370
You work it out.

39:34.370 --> 39:35.680
Actually, you are...omputer, you become...ivine
computer.

39:35.680 --> 39:39.170
But that’s...ifferent system and so it’s
better that we talk about it just now.

39:39.170 --> 39:42.490
And you get your realization; work it out.

39:42.490 --> 39:50.220
We are going to be here for some time and...ope
you’ll be able to follow my lectures and

39:50.220 --> 39:51.960
follow the whole thing.

39:51.960 --> 39:55.780
It’s such...remendous thing....ust tell
you about this in five hundred...00...ectures

39:55.780 --> 39:57.910
in London...t least...inimum....ay that every
time...peak.

39:57.910 --> 40:00.600
They say, “Mother, you are speaking something
now."

40:00.600 --> 40:03.960
So, you can imagine how much knowledge there
is there.

40:03.960 --> 40:06.700
But you are knowledge; you become knowledge
yourself.

40:06.700 --> 40:09.569
In Australia, the newspaper people were very
good to me because there was some happening....ady

40:09.569 --> 40:11.200
was very seriously ill

40:11.200 --> 40:19.980
and she had some sort of...ery serious stroke
and...riend of hers was...ig man at the newspapers

40:19.980 --> 40:24.690
and one of the Sahaja Yoginis there gave my
photograph to her.

40:24.690 --> 40:28.190
And she did get well from that...rom the photograph
only.

40:28.190 --> 40:35.570
So, this man started thinking about it and
then they did...ig publicity for me.

40:35.570 --> 40:45.280
So, it was lucky ,I should say, for Australians
and...as there for about one month or so...hree

40:45.280 --> 40:46.280
weeks.

40:46.280 --> 40:49.240
And we got thousands there now...housands.

40:49.240 --> 40:55.160
There are seven cities where we have seven
centers.

40:55.160 --> 41:00.980
It has worked....ust say, Australians are
very good for realization.

41:00.980 --> 41:08.480
It was surprising because certain people got
realization and settled down and they knew

41:08.480 --> 41:10.619
it was the trugh.

41:10.619 --> 41:13.600
That was the thing.

41:13.600 --> 41:18.839
YTou have to be intelligent enough to see
what i8s the truth.

41:18.839 --> 41:20.670
Don’t allow your intelligence to cheat you.

41:20.670 --> 41:23.010
Be careful about your intelligence...lso,
it can cheat you.

41:23.010 --> 41:26.630
But you should be really sharp about it to
see what is the truth.

41:26.630 --> 41:28.540
And wise.

41:28.540 --> 41:35.490
And that is what you are going to have.

41:35.490 --> 41:51.349
Now,...ould request you to ask me questions
because you see you all must be having lots

41:51.349 --> 41:52.349
of questions.

41:52.349 --> 41:58.170
You have your mind and you should better ask
because...on’t want whild we are giving

41:58.170 --> 42:06.500
you realization that you should feel that,
“Oh,...idn’t ask this question to Mother,”...though

42:06.500 --> 42:11.730
this makes no difference whether you ask me
questions or not.

42:11.730 --> 42:13.180
It is...ery different thing.

42:13.180 --> 42:15.470
It is beyond your mind.

42:15.470 --> 42:19.329
You go beyond your mind.

42:19.329 --> 42:24.740
You go beyond your mind; beyond your ego;
beyond your super-ego.

42:24.740 --> 42:26.800
You become something else.

42:26.800 --> 42:30.970
So if you have any questions, you can ask.

42:30.970 --> 42:42.190
Question: There are many people who come offering
realization.

42:42.190 --> 42:48.020
You come offering realization....ould like
to know something about this.

42:48.020 --> 43:04.750
In other words, you have something unique
to offer, is that right?

43:04.750 --> 43:16.809
Yes, of course...ould say...on’t know how
many have come here and how many have been

43:16.809 --> 43:20.030
thugs and how many have been real.

43:20.030 --> 43:24.850
But, actually most of them have been thugs
only because what they offer you...

43:24.850 --> 43:25.850
don’t know...

43:25.850 --> 43:29.200
have had people from other gurus...ll kinds
of gurus you see.

43:29.200 --> 43:31.800
And there are one or two sitting here.

43:31.800 --> 43:34.730
All of them have been to someone or something
like that.

43:34.730 --> 43:38.220
Now as...old you, the uniqueness of Sahaja
Yoga is this: Sahaja means...Saha” is with;

43:38.220 --> 43:39.650
“ja” is born...s born with you....

43:39.650 --> 43:41.190
is your own....

43:41.190 --> 43:42.530
within you.

43:42.530 --> 43:46.950
Now the uniqueness about it is this: that
it is what you are seeking.

43:46.950 --> 43:52.660
That’s what you are going to get....

43:52.660 --> 43:58.730
is your spirit....

43:58.730 --> 44:02.890
is that you become that...s the uniqueness.

44:02.890 --> 44:06.420
It’s not that...an say there is...ourse
of

44:06.420 --> 44:13.490
ten days...ou go through the course or you
pay for say...umping course or...o-called

44:13.490 --> 44:17.510
flying course or something like that.

44:17.510 --> 44:19.500
It is what you are.

44:19.500 --> 44:20.700
You become that.

44:20.700 --> 44:27.040
The uniqueness of it is that it’s...appening
which is...iving happening.

44:27.040 --> 44:34.170
You see, we don’t do anything that is...iving
work.

44:34.170 --> 44:38.130
What we do is...ead work.

44:38.130 --> 44:46.840
Like...ree died; we make chairs; we think
we have achieved alot.

44:46.840 --> 44:52.480
You see this wall is all made of dead things,
isn’t it?

44:52.480 --> 44:55.370
We have just changed the form.

44:55.370 --> 44:58.210
And these forms actually try to dominate us.

44:58.210 --> 45:03.220
This chair becomes...ort of an obsession for
us because we can’t sit on the ground....

45:03.220 --> 45:04.910
this...e have to use...hair like that.

45:04.910 --> 45:08.550
Now, anything that we do is all dead.

45:08.550 --> 45:11.430
Supposing somebody has to jump.

45:11.430 --> 45:16.620
Anybody can jump., What is there to be jumping?

45:16.620 --> 45:19.500
People pay money to jump.

45:19.500 --> 45:24.110
Can you imagine?...o take off clothes?...eople
pay money.

45:24.110 --> 45:26.420
How can that be?

45:26.420 --> 45:28.490
What is so great about it?

45:28.490 --> 45:30.980
We must understand: what do we become?

45:30.980 --> 45:32.760
What powers do we become?

45:32.760 --> 45:33.760
You see, there’s...uru.

45:33.760 --> 45:34.910
He says, “Alright,...ive you some knowledge."

45:34.910 --> 45:36.480
Now, what knowledge has he got?

45:36.480 --> 45:37.640
One gentleman came.

45:37.640 --> 45:39.950
He said, “I’ve already got knowledge."

45:39.950 --> 45:42.270
...aid, “What knowledge do you have?”

45:42.270 --> 45:45.030
For example, Warren can tell you where is
your chakra catching.

45:45.030 --> 45:50.410
Where is your kundalini; where it is obstructed;
how to raise it; how to bring it us; how to

45:50.410 --> 45:51.530
take it down.

45:51.530 --> 45:54.160
The he can cure patients.

45:54.160 --> 45:56.760
He must have cured...

45:56.760 --> 45:59.359
don’t know how many.

45:59.359 --> 46:03.869
You all can cure patientes and knowingly...hat
it is.

46:03.869 --> 46:06.609
What chakra is catching...hat is happening...hat
is the mental process.

46:06.609 --> 46:10.550
Everything, you know in your awareness.

46:10.550 --> 46:16.020
You become...ifferent person...s...ransformation
that takes place.

46:16.020 --> 46:17.570
You become master of yourself.

46:17.570 --> 46:19.650
To explain,...ill tell you...ery simple anology.

46:19.650 --> 46:21.390
Say we are traveling by....

46:21.390 --> 46:24.170
we are trying to learn how to drive.

46:24.170 --> 46:32.690
Now you have got an accelerator and you have
got...rake.

46:32.690 --> 46:35.070
You’re working it out.

46:35.070 --> 46:50.530
You see one, then another....e have two centers...wo
channels within us which...how tomorrow...ne

46:50.530 --> 46:52.630
for our actions.)

46:52.630 --> 47:02.530
So we start working both of these and start
managing.

47:02.530 --> 47:06.270
We go to extremes....

47:06.270 --> 47:18.690
this way...hat way...nd make all kinds of
mistakes...hatever it is...ut we try to balance

47:18.690 --> 47:19.690
ourselves.

47:19.690 --> 47:24.510
When do we learn the car driving?

47:24.510 --> 47:27.420
When we learn it.

47:27.420 --> 47:32.500
Once you have done that there the Master is...itting
at the back.

47:32.500 --> 47:38.510
And once He sees you have balanced it, He
gives you your place.

47:38.510 --> 47:41.950
You become the master of your being.

47:41.950 --> 47:43.950
This is what has to happen....

47:43.950 --> 47:44.950
the breakthrough!

47:44.950 --> 47:46.630
The breakthrough has to take place.

47:46.630 --> 47:53.150
Is not just...ake believe that, “Oh, we
have become like this."

47:53.150 --> 47:58.750
...ean there are people who believe they are
self realized.

47:58.750 --> 48:03.859
There are many like that, you see, that believe
that they are that.

48:03.859 --> 48:05.000
They are not.

48:05.000 --> 48:07.690
Because they should be able to tell.

48:07.690 --> 48:09.599
They should become collectively conscious.

48:09.599 --> 48:13.030
They should be able to tell where is the kundalini;
where is the problem.

48:13.030 --> 48:14.030
Now, for

48:14.030 --> 48:15.369
example, you are sitting....

48:15.369 --> 48:21.609
alright, now you do not know about the gentleman
next to you...here is the problem?

48:21.609 --> 48:23.369
Where is his kundalini?

48:23.369 --> 48:25.599
You cannot give him realization.

48:25.599 --> 48:40.900
But the people who are realized souls...ven
the small children...an do it...ery small

48:40.900 --> 48:42.030
children.

48:42.030 --> 48:49.480
They will immediately say, “This is the
center catching.

48:49.480 --> 48:54.280
Here...he finger...ittle children will show
the same finger.

48:54.280 --> 48:59.650
For example, if you have...roblem, say on
this center.

48:59.650 --> 49:00.650
Alright.

49:00.650 --> 49:06.309
All the children you put some sort of...hing
to close their eyes.

49:06.309 --> 49:09.220
And ask them, “Which center is catching?”

49:09.220 --> 49:10.880
They’ll all say this.

49:10.880 --> 49:12.920
All will say the same thing.

49:12.920 --> 49:15.940
And they also know how to correct this.

49:15.940 --> 49:18.960
Little, little children know how to correct
this.

49:18.960 --> 49:23.240
They are born realized and born realized children
are dynamic.

49:23.240 --> 49:28.510
And they know...o many born-realized children
are born these days.

49:28.510 --> 49:31.980
How will you know whether they are born realized
children?

49:31.980 --> 49:36.760
You do not know who is...alse guru and who
is...eal guru.

49:36.760 --> 49:38.559
You don’t know anything!

49:38.559 --> 49:40.349
There’s no discrimination power.

49:40.349 --> 49:47.799
But, if you want to know also about that,
you can just put the hands towards them and

49:47.799 --> 49:50.819
they can find out.

49:50.819 --> 49:54.599
Your vibrations will vanish completely.

49:54.599 --> 49:59.880
You’ll have heat coming from horrible gurus.

49:59.880 --> 50:10.190
If you see any horrible guru, you’ll find
very bad vibrations coming in that...ll burning

50:10.190 --> 50:14.770
and some of them just stop the vibrations.

50:14.770 --> 50:18.690
You just don’t get any vibrations from them.

50:18.690 --> 50:23.450
You can make it out from everyone what sort
of...erson he is.

50:23.450 --> 50:25.440
For example, there are athiests who don’t
believe in God.

50:25.440 --> 50:26.440
Alright.

50:26.440 --> 50:31.200
Now when they get realization they can ask
the question, “Is there God?”

50:31.200 --> 50:32.559
Tremendous vibrations.

50:32.559 --> 50:42.079
To find out relatively, we can say, take three
people...ne from...uru who’s horrid, one

50:42.079 --> 50:47.650
from...unatic asylum, and one who’s...ealized
soul, according to us.

50:47.650 --> 50:48.650
Alright?

50:48.650 --> 50:50.290
Now you put themn together.

50:50.290 --> 50:56.660
You’ll find the one who’s from the guru,
maybe feeling hot...ery hot...r may not get

50:56.660 --> 50:58.089
realization at all...aybe frozen...nything.

50:58.089 --> 51:02.089
The one from lunatic asylum may feel hot...orrible...ut
he may get well...e may get realization.

51:02.089 --> 51:04.760
And the third person, who is the one who is...ealized
soul will get only...ool breeze.

51:04.760 --> 51:06.760
We have cured many people who are meantally
like that...any have been cured...ou can cure

51:06.760 --> 51:07.760
also.

51:07.760 --> 51:08.760
It is you who become that...s the point.

51:08.760 --> 51:09.760
You become that...t’s your right.

51:09.760 --> 51:10.760
You have been seeking all your lives.

51:10.760 --> 51:11.760
Actually, it is impossible to believe that
there could be someone who does it just for

51:11.760 --> 51:12.760
loves sake.

51:12.760 --> 51:19.809
You can’t believe itr because it’s so
money oriented...he whole thing is so money

51:19.809 --> 51:20.809
oriented....

51:20.809 --> 51:22.869
that we can’t believe it.

51:22.869 --> 51:30.770
Even our parents; we think they love us for
money....ean, it has gone to that limit of

51:30.770 --> 51:31.770
absurdity.

51:31.770 --> 51:33.420
But God is l,ove and love is there.

51:33.420 --> 51:35.740
Ånd in his love everyone should do it.

51:35.740 --> 51:36.740
It has to happen.

51:36.740 --> 51:37.740
Any other questions?

51:37.740 --> 51:38.740
Question: (A woman asks where the other public
meeting will be).

51:38.740 --> 51:39.740
(Warren says he’ll make an announcement
later)

51:39.740 --> 51:40.740
Mother: You see, all of us have got it and
we’ll give all that to you and you’ll

51:40.740 --> 51:41.740
come along to those lectures and you will
help us to bring...

51:41.740 --> 51:43.569
(you see actually we do not know how to meet
the seekers.

51:43.569 --> 51:46.579
That’s the main point with us.

51:46.579 --> 51:49.960
And we don’t need anything else.

51:49.960 --> 51:51.589
Like the lady offered...lso.

51:51.589 --> 51:52.630
We don’t need it.

51:52.630 --> 51:53.940
We don’t need any money.

51:53.940 --> 51:54.940
We have everything.

51:54.940 --> 51:55.940
We have no problem.

51:55.940 --> 51:56.940
And no money...othing.

51:56.940 --> 52:00.920
We have got places to live in and we have
no problem of any kind.

52:00.920 --> 52:02.809
What we want...e have also got halls and everything
and we don’t need anything.

52:02.809 --> 52:04.724
But what we want...hat we want...eekers to
come down and you have to suggest how to get

52:04.724 --> 52:05.930
them; that’s all.

52:05.930 --> 52:07.140
(Announcements of meetings)

52:07.140 --> 52:08.140
Question:...

52:08.140 --> 52:13.290
lady asks for Mother’s comment on somebody
but asks Her not to judge.)

52:13.290 --> 52:14.770
Mother: No,...ave to.

52:14.770 --> 52:16.260
I’m sorry,...ave to.

52:16.260 --> 52:20.470
You see, it’s very good of you to say that...hould
not make comment(word?).

52:20.470 --> 52:21.470
But...ave to.

52:21.470 --> 52:22.470
I’m sorry.

52:22.470 --> 52:23.530
Because you see,...an’t bear to see the
way their kundalini’s have gone down.

52:23.530 --> 52:26.630
The connection has to be.

52:26.630 --> 52:30.980
You see, when Christ was criticizing them,
they said the same thing to him.

52:30.980 --> 52:34.980
“Why should you criticize them?

52:34.980 --> 52:37.240
They don’t critisize you?”

52:37.240 --> 52:48.150
So He said, “The Satanic are not going to
speak against the Satanic."

52:48.150 --> 52:49.280
That’s what it is.

52:49.280 --> 52:55.690
You do not know how serious it is.

52:55.690 --> 53:09.030
When you will know, you will be amazed.

53:09.030 --> 53:18.859
You do not know how serious it is and that’s
shy you are saying that.

53:18.859 --> 53:21.799
Once you find out shy...m saying this.

53:21.799 --> 53:26.700
You see, it is not easy to say anything against
these people.

53:26.700 --> 53:27.790
It’s not easy.

53:27.790 --> 53:31.549
Bust none of them...

53:31.549 --> 53:48.280
have said about them...ach one of them about
l0 years back...penly...bout each one of them...ho

53:48.280 --> 53:50.670
they are.

53:50.670 --> 54:01.480
Nobody has even tried to even bring any suit
or any law suit against me.

54:01.480 --> 54:04.710
And whatever is wrong,...ave to say that.

54:04.710 --> 54:06.250
I’m sorry, my child.

54:06.250 --> 54:09.830
You see, this is not...hing where you can
allow Satanic things to happen.

54:09.830 --> 54:10.830
We have to discriminate.

54:10.830 --> 54:11.830
You will know yourself.

54:11.830 --> 54:12.830
You cannot love...nake like that.

54:12.830 --> 54:14.490
You must know...nake is...nake and...uman
being is...uman being.

54:14.490 --> 54:15.490
Everybody has his own values.

54:15.490 --> 54:17.770
You see,...m not here going to be angry with
you for that.

54:17.770 --> 54:20.770
But...m angry with them!...ith all of them...efinitely.

54:20.770 --> 54:23.470
You do not...ou just wait and see.

54:23.470 --> 54:26.619
You yourself will be so angry.

54:26.619 --> 54:28.200
I’ll show you.

54:28.200 --> 54:31.880
Say,...irl who came from one of them...hugs.

54:31.880 --> 54:33.450
She was epileptic.

54:33.450 --> 54:35.550
Her daughter was epileptic.

54:35.550 --> 54:37.660
Her husband was epileptic.

54:37.660 --> 54:39.230
She was...randdaughter of...uke.

54:39.230 --> 54:42.380
She had lost all her money.

54:42.380 --> 54:45.010
They had sold their house.

54:45.010 --> 54:47.640
They were on the streets.

54:47.640 --> 54:48.640
Absolutely.

54:48.640 --> 54:49.750
And she is...eeker!

54:49.750 --> 54:52.560
If you are...ohter, what would you say to
that?

54:52.560 --> 54:54.869
You will say they are very nice people?

54:54.869 --> 54:55.970
You will go and garland them?

54:55.970 --> 54:56.970
Not one, but I’ll show you thousands of
them.

54:56.970 --> 54:59.420
Here we have cases who have come.

54:59.420 --> 55:00.800
She is Hesta...itting here.

55:00.800 --> 55:01.800
You just ask her.

55:01.800 --> 55:02.800
How much she was harmed!

55:02.800 --> 55:03.800
How she was harmed.

55:03.800 --> 55:04.800
She would have been dead!

55:04.800 --> 55:05.800
Do you think...hould say they are nice people?

55:05.800 --> 55:06.800
Apart from anything else, they spoil your
chances of realization.

55:06.800 --> 55:07.800
I am not here for votes or anything.

55:07.800 --> 55:08.800
Why should...ry to please them?...ave to tell
the truth, if you don’t mind....ave to tell.

55:08.800 --> 55:09.800
Question: Oh, then...ould just like to ask,
what about people that are doing chakra therapy

55:09.800 --> 55:10.800
and they charge very high prices?

55:10.800 --> 55:16.170
Maybe they are not high prices and they help
people and yet people don’t have that kind

55:16.170 --> 55:22.890
of money....ould like to ask you, what do
you think about people who do chakra therapy

55:22.890 --> 55:23.890
and charge fees?

55:23.890 --> 55:24.890
Mother:...on’t know what sort of...

55:24.890 --> 55:25.890
(word?)

55:25.890 --> 55:26.890
make believes.

55:26.890 --> 55:27.890
How can you have any kind of chakra thearpy
without realization?

55:27.890 --> 55:28.890
It’s all make believe.

55:28.890 --> 55:29.890
You blieve all this nonsensical people.

55:29.890 --> 55:30.890
What am...o do now?

55:30.890 --> 55:31.890
Why do you believe them?

55:31.890 --> 55:32.890
You see chakra therapy,...ean...on’t know...n
ordinary Indian can understand.

55:32.890 --> 55:33.890
Only...aint can do it.

55:33.890 --> 55:34.890
He has to be...aint.

55:34.890 --> 55:35.890
How can he charge money?...aint will not take...ie
from you.

55:35.890 --> 55:36.890
It is...imple thing, try to understand that.

55:36.890 --> 55:37.890
Question: Well,...lways thought that, but
this is America.

55:37.890 --> 55:38.890
Chakra therapy is...ew thing, I’ve heard...laugh)
(woman keeps telling her story)

55:38.890 --> 55:39.890
Mother:...ell you that.

55:39.890 --> 55:40.890
What is it.

55:40.890 --> 55:41.890
You might get...emporary help.

55:41.890 --> 55:42.890
No doubt about it.

55:42.890 --> 55:43.890
You can get...emporary help.

55:43.890 --> 55:44.890
You see, now you are bringing into controversies
so...ave to tell you about it.

55:44.890 --> 55:45.890
But you don’t mind it.

55:45.890 --> 55:46.890
What heppens within us, we have some stored
energies in the chakras, alright?

55:46.890 --> 55:47.890
And, like acupuncture, is also...s not to
be done by someone who is not...ealized soul.

55:47.890 --> 55:48.890
Is to be done only by realized souls.

55:48.890 --> 55:49.890
If acupuncture is done by someone who is not...ealized
soul...

55:49.890 --> 55:50.890
mean it’s against Zen (?).

55:50.890 --> 55:51.890
It’s against.

55:51.890 --> 55:52.890
You have to be...word ?),...ean people don’t
read about it....usha (word ?) means...ealized

55:52.890 --> 55:53.890
soul.

55:53.890 --> 55:54.890
If you are not...ealized soul, you are not
supposed to do it.

55:54.890 --> 55:55.890
Now, this one also...hakra therapy...hat you
can do is to work on the sympathetic nervous

55:55.890 --> 55:56.890
system.

55:56.890 --> 55:57.890
Now the sympathetic nervous system, you can
pull out the little energy that you have,

55:57.890 --> 55:58.890
but you develop other problems with it.

55:58.890 --> 55:59.890
Sahaja Yoga is...hing by which you get open
to the all pervading power....ll the time

55:59.890 --> 56:00.890
flowing within us.

56:00.890 --> 56:25.059
You have to open yourslf to that universal
being within your heart...hich is the spirit.

56:25.059 --> 56:26.690
You don’t have to sort of lessen energy
here and energy there and energy there.

56:26.690 --> 56:27.690
You don’t have to take that energy out.

56:27.690 --> 56:28.690
But the energy from the above comes in.

56:28.690 --> 56:29.690
Like grace, it flows.

56:29.690 --> 56:30.690
And that’s how always such things can lead
into terrible problems...ental problems....

56:30.690 --> 56:31.690
all kinds of things.

56:31.690 --> 56:32.690
Supposing you try to treat somebody mentally....

56:32.690 --> 56:33.690
then you extract the physical energy.

56:33.690 --> 56:34.690
Then the person will suffer physically.

56:34.690 --> 56:35.690
You see, this

56:35.690 --> 56:36.690
stored energy for...articular chakra, which...ill
explain to you...verything...ll right?

56:36.690 --> 56:37.690
And you cannot charge for raising your kundalini
because you have your kundalini intact there.

56:37.690 --> 56:38.690
You are just there.

56:38.690 --> 56:39.690
You have everything.

56:39.690 --> 56:40.690
Only thing, by my being here, your kundalini
rises by itself.

56:40.690 --> 56:41.690
So you cannot pay.

56:41.690 --> 56:42.690
Do you pay the Mother Earth for sprouting...eed?

56:42.690 --> 56:43.690
They do help temporarily.

56:43.690 --> 56:44.690
They do.

56:44.690 --> 56:45.690
For example, somebody gives you...antra.

56:45.690 --> 56:46.690
Alright, take...antra...’ll tell you...ay
they say Rama Sita.

56:46.690 --> 56:47.690
Now, there cannot be only one mantra belonging
to any one in any science of mantras.

56:47.690 --> 56:48.690
Because you people are so naive...ou see...hey
say “all right, you take the name of Rama."

56:48.690 --> 56:49.690
This cannot be done.

56:49.690 --> 56:50.690
Rama mantra is only on the right heart chakra.

56:50.690 --> 56:51.690
If you have...roblem, has to be given by...ealized
soul because it has to be...onnected one.

56:51.690 --> 56:52.690
It is...cience, you know.

56:52.690 --> 56:53.690
All of them know what mantra is to be said
at what point because they know how to raise

56:53.690 --> 56:54.690
the kundalini....

56:54.690 --> 56:55.690
they know where it is obstructed and what
mantra is to be said and which Deity is to

56:55.690 --> 56:56.690
be awakened.

56:56.690 --> 56:58.940
Notice the mantra for which particular mantra
(word?)...hey know all that and they know

56:58.940 --> 56:59.940
all the methods.

56:59.940 --> 57:00.940
But why they may give you...antra?

57:00.940 --> 57:01.940
Now, you may feel better...eally, sometimes
you may feel dynamic.

57:01.940 --> 57:02.940
You feel, “Oh,...m very activated; maybe...m
over active."

57:02.940 --> 57:03.940
And...pirit (if that name may be allowed)
may come around...nd you may become possessed...nd

57:03.940 --> 57:04.940
you might become extremely active.

57:04.940 --> 57:05.940
But, then you’ll go down.

57:05.940 --> 57:06.940
Within five years, there will be...omplete
decline.

57:06.940 --> 57:07.940
You’ll be...ecluse.

57:07.940 --> 57:08.940
You’ll be...rightened person.

57:08.940 --> 57:09.940
You’ll be...oward.

57:09.940 --> 57:10.940
You won’t be able to even...here are people
I’ve known who can not even face (what do

57:10.940 --> 57:11.940
you call that...arlic.

57:11.940 --> 57:12.940
Can you imagine...fraid of...egetable?

57:12.940 --> 57:13.940
It’s really...here are people, if you snow
then garlic, they are frightened....ean, are

57:13.940 --> 57:14.940
you going to become like that?

57:14.940 --> 57:15.940
Is that freedom?

57:15.940 --> 57:16.940
Question: (A man had treid raising his kundalini
and was asking about seeing something (?) in

57:16.940 --> 57:17.940
his head and other places).

57:17.940 --> 57:18.940
Mother: You see, if you try your own self,
you see trying with the kundalini...ctually

57:18.940 --> 57:19.940
the sympathetic goes into activity.

57:19.940 --> 57:20.940
You have no right on the parasympathetic.

57:20.940 --> 57:21.940
Parasympathetic is the one which balances
and that is the central path of Sushumna through

57:21.940 --> 57:22.940
which the kundalini has to rise.

57:22.940 --> 57:23.940
But if you try anything, what you do is...lways
you can use sympathetic.

57:23.940 --> 57:24.940
I’ll give you an example.

57:24.940 --> 57:25.940
Supposing you are running fast.

57:25.940 --> 57:26.940
Alright, then you can raise the rate of your
heart.

57:26.940 --> 57:27.940
But you cannot slow it down.

57:27.940 --> 57:28.940
It slows down

57:28.940 --> 57:29.940
by itself.

57:29.940 --> 57:30.940
That is parasympathetic activity.

57:30.940 --> 57:31.940
So you just get into sympathetic activity
and sympathetic activity, if you overdo it,

57:31.940 --> 57:32.940
then all these symptoms happen and it’s
not healthful.

57:32.940 --> 57:33.940
On the contrary, chakras go into...

57:33.940 --> 57:34.940
.(quite like this is the left and the right
sympathetic and these are the centers).

57:34.940 --> 57:35.940
They get pulled down like that and if they
are pulled like this, then you are harmed.

57:35.940 --> 57:36.940
So is not an experience of kundalini; is of
the sympathetic.

57:36.940 --> 57:37.940
Question: “....his wasn’t anything...as
looking for or asking for, (etc.)but how come

57:37.940 --> 57:38.940
it went down, instead of coming up?”

57:38.940 --> 57:39.940
Mother: No, it doesn’t go down.

57:39.940 --> 57:40.940
Kundalini never goes down.

57:40.940 --> 57:41.940
It goes upward...lways.

57:41.940 --> 57:42.940
The thing that comes down is the grace, you
see.

57:42.940 --> 57:43.940
The grace comes down, not the Kundalini.

57:43.940 --> 57:44.940
Kundalini always goes upwards.

57:44.940 --> 57:45.940
And the grace comes on your sympathetic which
cools you down completely.

57:45.940 --> 57:46.940
You become absolutely relaxed with the grace.

57:46.940 --> 57:47.940
But the kundalini itself always goes up.

57:47.940 --> 57:48.940
It never comes down.

57:48.940 --> 57:49.940
But, in people, it so happens that kundalini
goes through this central path.

57:49.940 --> 57:50.940
Now, if it is...ort of...ery much rugged or
if it is extremely smooth due to the mistakes

57:50.940 --> 57:51.940
of the seekers, then it falls down.

57:51.940 --> 57:52.940
It falls down...t falls down is...ifferent
point then going like that.

57:52.940 --> 57:53.940
It falls down.

57:53.940 --> 57:54.940
Then you have to raise it again and tie it
up.

57:54.940 --> 57:55.940
Again, raise it and tie it up.

57:55.940 --> 57:56.940
In many people, it has to be done but it can
work out.

57:56.940 --> 57:57.940
You will get the complete knowledge, don’t
you worry.

57:57.940 --> 57:58.940
Now, he has been in eighteen months, but he
is...aster of kundalini.

57:58.940 --> 57:59.940
He can raise your kundalini and you are just
like him.

57:59.940 --> 58:00.940
You would become the same.

58:00.940 --> 58:01.940
There’s no problem at all.

58:01.940 --> 58:02.940
It will work out.

58:02.940 --> 58:03.940
Question:...ow did you get your realization?”

58:03.940 --> 58:04.940
Mother:...as born like that.

58:04.940 --> 58:05.940
I’m like this for ages....

58:05.940 --> 58:06.940
ancient....m...ystery...

58:06.940 --> 58:07.940
should say at the beginning.

58:07.940 --> 58:08.940
We should keep it as...ystery.

58:08.940 --> 58:09.940
Then you’ll discover me, all right?

58:09.940 --> 58:10.940
Let’s have it that way.

58:10.940 --> 58:11.940
First you discover yourself and then discover
me.

58:11.940 --> 58:12.940
Will be better idea, isn’t it?

58:12.940 --> 58:13.940
Because...on’t want to say something which
will unnecessarily make some people upset.

58:13.940 --> 58:14.940
Best is...ou become something.

58:14.940 --> 58:15.940
Question:...s it true...ealized guru has cool
air; not hot?”

58:15.940 --> 58:16.940
Mother: No, hot is very dangerous.

58:16.940 --> 58:17.940
Interuption: “....ut...ool one, is also
dangerous?”

58:17.940 --> 58:18.940
Mother:...ut you don’t get air.

58:18.940 --> 58:19.940
You might feel extremely cool if you are...ow
blood pressure patient.

58:19.940 --> 58:20.940
If you are...eft sided persons...f you are
possessed, you feel absolutely cool, very

58:20.940 --> 58:21.940
cool.

58:21.940 --> 58:22.940
That’s not good.

58:22.940 --> 58:23.940
Feeling cool is different from...ool breeze;
like you feel...reeze coming.

58:23.940 --> 58:24.940
But should not be hot in any case.

58:24.940 --> 58:25.940
Hot is...ery dangerous thing.

58:25.940 --> 58:26.940
If it is too hot, that heat...t’s not good.

58:26.940 --> 58:27.940
Question: “Why do you get...low of hot air?”

58:27.940 --> 58:28.940
Mother: It’s...riction.

58:28.940 --> 58:29.940
It’s...riction of the Divine.

58:29.940 --> 58:30.940
You see, when the Kundalini’s rising, She
should normally give you cool breeze....

58:30.940 --> 58:31.940
cool breeze in the hands...hen She does.

58:31.940 --> 58:32.940
But if there’s...riction...lways friction
makes it hot.

58:32.940 --> 58:33.940
But it cools down.

58:33.940 --> 58:34.940
There’s no problem.

58:34.940 --> 58:35.940
In the beginning, most of you will get hot,
little bit.

58:35.940 --> 58:36.940
Because, after all, you see you know...ou
are all very complicated people.

58:36.940 --> 58:37.940
Our brains especially are modern brains, you
see.

58:37.940 --> 58:38.940
So we have been thinking, thinking, thinking.

58:38.940 --> 58:39.940
Just, we cannot stop our thinking for...inute
even.

58:39.940 --> 58:40.940
But the first thing that will happen is that
you enter into thoughtless awareness.

58:40.940 --> 58:41.940
That’s called as Nirvachara Samahdi, in
Sanskrit.

58:41.940 --> 58:42.940
Means you become....

58:42.940 --> 58:43.940
you are aware, absolutely aware.

58:43.940 --> 58:44.940
There are no thoughts.

58:44.940 --> 58:45.940
The thoughts(word?)...hat the awakening of
Christ...hat’s the thing that should happen

58:45.940 --> 58:46.940
to you.

58:46.940 --> 58:47.940
Once that happens, then it passes through
here and you can feel the cool breeze.

58:47.940 --> 58:48.940
Many people who smoke cannot feel breeze in
the hand at the beginning because of this

58:48.940 --> 58:49.940
chakra being...ittle bit in trouble.

58:49.940 --> 58:50.940
But, then you start feeling...arsha (??), you
feel quite all right in the hands?

58:50.940 --> 58:51.940
She used to smoke.

58:51.940 --> 58:52.940
She is...reat seeker,...ust say.

58:52.940 --> 58:53.940
All right, should we have it now?

58:53.940 --> 58:54.940
Question: “If we’re going to receive the
Kundalini awakening, is it...rocess over several

58:54.940 --> 58:55.940
days?”

58:55.940 --> 58:56.940
Mother: No, it is...plit of...econd actually;
it is...plit of...econd.

58:56.940 --> 58:57.940
But it takes time in some people, as...aid,
because if there are obstructions...ou see.

58:57.940 --> 58:58.940
Now if you have...eautiful runway and...eautiful
aircraft, then the landing and take off are

58:58.940 --> 58:59.940
very smooth.

58:59.940 --> 59:00.940
But sometimes it is...econd-hand stop.

59:00.940 --> 59:01.940
Interruption:...hen, you mean it may come
tomorrow?”

59:01.940 --> 59:02.940
Warren: No, it’s highly likely you’ll
get it tonight.

59:02.940 --> 59:03.940
Mother: Yes, of course, just now.

59:03.940 --> 59:04.940
Just now.

59:04.940 --> 59:05.940
But you have to learn how to maintain it,
is the point.

59:05.940 --> 59:06.940
Just now, you are going to have it.

59:06.940 --> 59:07.940
It’s spontaneous.

59:07.940 --> 59:08.940
It is just now.

59:08.940 --> 59:09.940
But only one thing is that you should know
how to maintain it.

59:09.940 --> 59:10.940
Now supposing you get it and then outside
you start thinking about it.

59:10.940 --> 59:11.940
Then it goes down.

59:11.940 --> 59:12.940
The vibrations will be lost.

59:12.940 --> 59:13.940
You have to be careful.

59:13.940 --> 59:14.940
It’s like...eed sprouting, you know....eed
sprouting.

59:14.940 --> 59:15.940
It’s...eedling in the beginning.

59:15.940 --> 59:16.940
So you have to be careful for about seven
days.

59:16.940 --> 59:17.940
If you are careful, it is settled down in
about seven days.

59:17.940 --> 59:18.940
You have to be careful.

59:18.940 --> 59:19.940
We will tell you about it.

59:19.940 --> 59:20.940
Interruption: “The reason I’m asking is
because we’ll become messengers...

59:20.940 --> 59:21.940
”

59:21.940 --> 59:22.940
Mother: Yes, of course, of course.

59:22.940 --> 59:23.940
Next time I’m not going to import people
from Australia and from England.

59:23.940 --> 59:24.940
You have got to have the Americans here to
do this job.

59:24.940 --> 59:25.940
We are not going to import them from all over
the place.

59:25.940 --> 59:26.940
Two are coming from Switzerland.

59:26.940 --> 59:27.940
So that’s not...ery good sign....hink, actually,
Americans should go abroad and do it.

59:27.940 --> 59:28.940
They’ll go to India and to Indian villages....

59:28.940 --> 59:29.940
and they’ll do it in the Indian villages.

59:29.940 --> 59:30.940
Very simple, alright?

59:30.940 --> 59:31.940
Question: (Unintelligible....

59:31.940 --> 59:32.940
something about...eadache).

59:32.940 --> 59:33.940
Mother:...ell you what’s the problem with
you.

59:33.940 --> 59:34.940
You have...iver problem.

59:34.940 --> 59:35.940
You have...iver problem and that is showing.

59:35.940 --> 59:36.940
You see this is the beauty of Sahaja Yoga.

59:36.940 --> 59:37.940
Once you get realization, you start seeing
your body; feeling it.

59:37.940 --> 59:38.940
Whatever your problem, you know.

59:38.940 --> 59:39.940
You have You have...iver problem and it has
to be corrected.

59:39.940 --> 59:40.940
Now,...now you have...iver problem sitting
down here.

59:40.940 --> 59:41.940
And it’s very simple.

59:41.940 --> 59:42.940
Now in Sahaja Yoga, you can correct your liver
in no time.

59:42.940 --> 59:43.940
Once you correct your liver, you’ll have
never...eadache.

59:43.940 --> 59:44.940
But, it suggests that you have that and you’d
better get rid of it.

59:44.940 --> 59:45.940
You see it’s good you have...eadache, now
you’ll get after your liver.

59:45.940 --> 59:46.940
Otherwise, it becomes horribly bad, if you
continue....ean,...erson becomes mad and still

59:46.940 --> 59:47.940
he doesn’t know that he’s gone mad.

59:47.940 --> 59:48.940
It’s like that.

59:48.940 --> 59:49.940
The disease crawls into you.

59:49.940 --> 59:50.940
But in Sahaja Yoga, immediately you know.

59:50.940 --> 59:51.940
And you are...iver patient, you know that.

59:51.940 --> 59:52.940
It has to be corrected and it’s not difficult.

59:52.940 --> 59:53.940
Most of the diseases can be cured, except
for...ew like...hould say, cataracts or something

59:53.940 --> 59:54.940
like that where something is dead or maybe
where they put an artificial limb and all

59:54.940 --> 59:55.940
that.

59:55.940 --> 59:56.940
We can’t work out all of these things.

59:56.940 --> 59:57.940
But most of the things get cured, automatically....ean,
here they say if you cure someone, you’ll

59:57.940 --> 59:58.940
get put in the prison....ean,...on’t cure.

59:58.940 --> 59:59.940
You just get cured, you see.

59:59.940 --> 01:00:00.940
So...ope legally I’m all right.

01:00:00.940 --> 01:00:01.940
Christ would have been in jail here....on’t
know about the laws.

01:00:01.940 --> 01:00:02.940
But this time, I’m sure they cannot crucify
me.

01:00:02.940 --> 01:00:03.940
It’s alright.

01:00:03.940 --> 01:00:03.944
Let’s work it out.
