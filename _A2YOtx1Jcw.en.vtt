00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:27.710
First – we bow to Shri Ganesha
because Shri Ganesha is the source of innocence

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:29.619
within us.

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:39.360
So actually we bow to innocence within us.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:52.750
And this innocence is the one [that] gives
you the enlightenment.

00:00:52.750 --> 00:01:09.010
As I told you yesterday the light has innocence,
but this is innocent without knowledge.

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:15.660
But your light is innocent with knowledge.

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:23.860
We always think that the people who have got
knowledge can never be innocent, can never

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.350
be simple.

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:34.430
And the idea we have got about innocence is
that a innocent person is always deceived,

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:44.080
can be befooled – and can be always taken
for granted.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:57.830
But innocence is a power; it is a power which
protects you, which gives you light of knowledge.

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:10.390
Knowledge that we have in the worldly sense
is how to exploit others, how to cheat others,

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:25.280
how to make money out of them, how to make
fun of others, how to look down upon others.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:34.680
But the light of innocence is the light by
which you know that love is the highest thing.

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:46.670
And it teaches you how to love others, how
to care for others, how to be gentle about

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:47.780
others.

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.280
It also gives you the light within.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.940
It’s just the other way round of this Avidya
that we have in this world.

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.709
Just the other way round.

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:15.200
The Avidya outside teaches us competition,
how to put the other person down.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:22.420
Because it has fear, it is insecured.

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:28.069
This knowledge is not secured – at all.

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:35.010
If it had security it would not have behaved
like this.

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.110
But the light of innocence knows everything.

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:45.270
It has no fear.

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:54.040
When we say ‘children are innocent’ we
mean to say that they have that power of innocence.

00:03:54.040 --> 00:04:02.840
Many times people have noticed if a child
falls from a height, it doesn’t die; while

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:10.319
a young man may die with a much smaller height.

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:12.480
And the child is not afraid while falling.

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:22.770
He just enjoys, as if there is a parachute
coming down, you know, nicely.

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.770
And then when he falls down, also he just
gets up, laughs, smiles at everyone.

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:32.580
He doesn’t understand why everybody is worried.

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:38.849
Because in that innocence he knows that he’s
looked after, he’s protected.

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:48.839
He knows that there is a power, which is much
higher than him and he does not have to worry.

00:04:48.839 --> 00:04:56.729
Then we start putting ideas into the head
of the child, and that is how he starts losing

00:04:56.729 --> 00:05:10.189
his power of innocence and he becomes a coward,
he becomes a cunning fellow, he becomes an

00:05:10.189 --> 00:05:17.189
unrighteous personality.

00:05:17.189 --> 00:05:27.349
But still we would say that the innocence
of children is [the] innocence of ignorance,

00:05:27.349 --> 00:05:35.499
in a way, because they do not know the dangers
of life.

00:05:35.499 --> 00:05:48.589
But the light of innocence knows all the dangers,
and also knows how to get rid of it, also

00:05:48.589 --> 00:05:53.070
knows how to be away from such a person.

00:05:53.070 --> 00:06:09.169
There was a wise man, who was going on a staircase,
and there was a stupid man coming from the

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:12.410
other side – foolish man.

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:18.569
So foolish people are always aggressive, that
is one of the signs, because they have inferiority

00:06:18.569 --> 00:06:20.289
complex.

00:06:20.289 --> 00:06:27.160
So the foolish man says to the man who was
coming up, he says – [because] one had to

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:32.699
move on one side – so he says, “I don’t
move for fools!”

00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:36.449
The foolish one says.

00:06:36.449 --> 00:06:43.710
So the wise man says, “I do,” and he moved.

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:57.021
(Laughter) That’s how the light of innocence
tells you how far to go with a person, how

00:06:57.021 --> 00:07:06.719
far to talk to a person, how far to indulge
in another person’s personality or his problems;

00:07:06.719 --> 00:07:09.249
otherwise he recedes.

00:07:09.249 --> 00:07:14.439
He understands that this gentleman is a stupid
fool so “I move for a fool like that.”

00:07:14.439 --> 00:07:22.429
He doesn’t pay attention to such a person,
he doesn’t bother about such a person.

00:07:22.429 --> 00:07:28.429
This is the light of innocence which gives
you discrimination.

00:07:28.429 --> 00:07:29.819
How far to go with others.

00:07:29.819 --> 00:07:34.219
I love a person, there are many, “I love
him”.

00:07:34.219 --> 00:07:35.219
Alright!

00:07:35.219 --> 00:07:41.179
The another person may kick you, may hit you,
may trouble you, may become absolutely horribly

00:07:41.179 --> 00:07:50.990
possessed, but still you are just mad in love
with that person, without any self-respect.

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:57.839
This comes because there is no…you may be
innocent, in a way, in a worldly manner, but

00:07:57.839 --> 00:08:00.300
you are not enlightened and innocent.

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:07.759
When you are enlightened and innocent then
your innocence is a power, which gives you,

00:08:07.759 --> 00:08:13.419
first thing, is discretion.

00:08:13.419 --> 00:08:20.069
Supposing you take a light in your hand – now
you know whether it is a snake or a rope,

00:08:20.069 --> 00:08:24.009
but if there is no light in your hand, you
cannot see.

00:08:24.009 --> 00:08:30.379
But even, supposing it’s a snake, you might
run away, or if you are a stupid fool, you’ll

00:08:30.379 --> 00:08:31.999
say, “Alright, come and bite me.

00:08:31.999 --> 00:08:39.410
I would like to see, how it works.”

00:08:39.410 --> 00:08:44.030
(Child laughs.

00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:52.650
Laughter) But if you are an enlightened person,
then you will tell the snake, “Now, let

00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:53.870
me be alone.

00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:54.870
Alright?

00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:55.870
Bye-bye.”

00:08:55.870 --> 00:09:00.340
(Laughter) And the snake will know and it
will go away.

00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:08.870
Or if the snake is a sinister one, you may
just look at the snake and snake might run

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:10.020
off.

00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:18.620
So this power of innocence is a very, very
important thing, and that comes to us through

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:22.210
our enlightenment alone.

00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:33.830
So we are, say, in a state which is ignorant
and innocent – innocent and ignorant.

00:09:33.830 --> 00:09:40.920
Then people are no more innocent nor ignorant,
but they are not enlightened – they become

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:41.920
cunning!

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:49.640
If they don’t have both the qualities – they
are neither ignorant, so-called, they have

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:56.260
got knowledge, they are good at everything,
they are well known people, for their intelligence,

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:59.940
brilliance, everything – so they are knowledgeable,
so-called.

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:06.840
So such people we could call as the people
who have got the knowledge, in the worldly

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:11.850
sense, but they have no innocence.

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:17.470
So they start devising methods, the innocence
which is there, which puts a little control

00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:21.280
over such a mind, is lost.

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:23.240
Because they think innocence is stupid, you
know?

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:25.380
They don’t respect their innocence.

00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:32.380
So they start manoeuvring people, doing violent
things, doing harmful things, saying nasty,

00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:33.640
sarcastic things.

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:42.310
All these things the brain starts working,
because it cannot get back to its innocence.

00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:45.770
So we don’t like such people later on, we
don’t want them.

00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:52.730
Then they develop ideas that, “We are higher
people, we are chosen people, we are better

00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:55.050
people,” then – they develop all these
ideas.

00:10:55.050 --> 00:10:58.200
Then they, all of them club together.

00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:04.420
So ignorance is added as a so-called knowledge,
you see.

00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:09.030
Inside is completely ignorance, outside is
knowledge.

00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:16.270
And added up – added up like that, they
do not want to seek their inside.

00:11:16.270 --> 00:11:24.050
And they are satisfied with their outside,
so-called knowledge.

00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:29.230
And they go ahead with it, and once they break
their heads, then they realise, “Oh God,

00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:30.500
what was it?

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:34.690
Inside is all darkness.”

00:11:34.690 --> 00:11:45.800
We cannot live with all the windows closed
hermetically and the sun shining outside.

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:56.400
We have to have light inside, to see for ourselves,
what are we, what are our powers, how far

00:11:56.400 --> 00:12:07.550
we can go, how we are working out ourselves,
our lives, our aims?

00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:17.410
Now the enlightenment, as the enlightenment
you see here is of these lights, is manifested

00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:27.180
within you as vibrations, as chaitanya, as
light.

00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:32.300
So the chaitanya itself is the light.

00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:40.310
But the difference between this light and
that light is such that this one will only

00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:44.930
tell you as far as your eyes are concerned.

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:53.090
It will tell you that it is a stone, or it
is a wood, or it is a house, or it is a face

00:12:53.090 --> 00:13:03.490
of a man – anything, this light, but it
won’t be able to tell you whether this person

00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:12.180
is good or bad, whether this house is vibrated
or not, is auspicious or not.

00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:16.490
So it doesn’t give you auspiciousness, the
idea of auspiciousness.

00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:22.210
So we are talking of Ganesha’s innocence,
which gives us sense of auspiciousness, and

00:13:22.210 --> 00:13:28.930
ourselves also makes us auspicious.

00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:43.130
This is how the chaitanya itself is enlightenment,
chaitanya itself is enlightenment.

00:13:43.130 --> 00:13:50.000
It relates to you all the knowledge which
it has.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:57.890
Now imagine what a micro-arrangement it is
that the chaitanyas, which are small, small

00:13:57.890 --> 00:14:06.670
like, we can say, little round valayas, small,
small ones.

00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:18.230
They have intelligence in them, and discretion
built-in them to tell you whether a person

00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:23.200
is good or bad.

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:27.310
You have got it, Sahaja Yoga, so in a simple
way.

00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:33.460
So we have not bothered to find out, what
your computer has got.

00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:42.900
It has got the knowledge now to know, not
only if the person is good or bad, but what

00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:46.270
troubles that person has got.

00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:58.650
Now this light can go up to one dimension
of a person, how he looks, how he walks, everything.

00:14:58.650 --> 00:15:11.120
And you, if you start imagining something,
if you start imagining – and saying that,

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:14.670
“I feel this way, I think this way.”

00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:19.900
(somebody interrupts Mother’s talk)

00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:23.250
Shri Mataji: not all right?

00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:24.250
Yogini: [inaudible]

00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:25.250
Shri Mataji: Ha?

00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:26.250
Yogini: [inaudible]

00:15:26.250 --> 00:15:27.890
Shri Mataji: You can’t hear Me?

00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:29.210
Many yogis: Yes.

00:15:29.210 --> 00:15:31.850
Upstairs only in the baby school.

00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:34.040
Shri Mataji: What is it?

00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:40.990
Akbar: There is a video for the mothers with
the children, and they can’t hear You.

00:15:40.990 --> 00:15:43.850
It is upstairs.

00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:53.080
Shri Mataji: I didn’t hear, what is it?

00:15:53.080 --> 00:16:03.060
Antonio Scialo: There is a children-room upstairs,
for children, with a video for children and

00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:04.060
mothers.

00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:05.060
But they cannot hear it.

00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:06.060
Shri Mataji: Oh I see, but the children are
here?

00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:09.870
Yogis: Babies, babies; mothers and babies.

00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:12.850
Shri Mataji: Oh God.

00:16:12.850 --> 00:16:25.540
Somebody has to go up and fix it up, isn’t
it?

00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:37.050
I think you should have tested it before,
isn’t it?

00:16:37.050 --> 00:16:38.980
Alright.

00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:55.430
So, the chaitanya that is within us, which
is flowing out, which we are receiving from

00:16:55.430 --> 00:17:13.059
all over, is all-pervading, is in every molecule
pulsating: which gives us knowledge about

00:17:13.059 --> 00:17:21.659
each and every matter, each and every animal,
each and every human being, and each and every

00:17:21.659 --> 00:17:25.519
Deity.

00:17:25.519 --> 00:17:36.159
Without this light you could not have recognised
Me.

00:17:36.159 --> 00:17:40.750
You could not have recognised any Deities.

00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:48.250
You could not have known your position in
life and your aims in life.

00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:54.749
You would not have known what is your purpose
of life, why are you here.

00:17:54.749 --> 00:17:58.490
Are you here just to make some money, put
some in the insurance, some in the shares?

00:17:58.490 --> 00:17:59.490
Of course, now nobody will do that!

00:17:59.490 --> 00:18:05.091
(The stock markets crashed on Monday 19 October
1987 the week of this puja) (Laughter) And

00:18:05.091 --> 00:18:12.610
get some house, and dance on the fingers of
your wife, or the wife has to dance as the

00:18:12.610 --> 00:18:21.619
dictates of the husband, to bring up children
somehow – are you here for that?

00:18:21.619 --> 00:18:28.499
This chaitanya tells you, very clearly, “No.”

00:18:28.499 --> 00:18:40.740
Because if you get more involved into these
things and become completely cut-off from

00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:47.009
the collective happenings, then this light
goes off.

00:18:47.009 --> 00:18:55.529
As soon as this light gets disconnected, you
can’t have any light.

00:18:55.529 --> 00:19:10.740
So, any connection, whatever you have, with
the vibrations has to be very strong, and

00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:13.860
has to be absolutely intact and steady.

00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:21.190
For example, if there is a light which is
not steady, which is moving, you can’t understand

00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:24.049
things properly.

00:19:24.049 --> 00:19:33.009
Though the vibrations know everything, but
how will they communicate this to an instrument

00:19:33.009 --> 00:19:50.179
which is not perfect, which does not respect
vibrations, which does not communicate with

00:19:50.179 --> 00:19:54.940
the vibrations?

00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:56.690
Please take the child out.

00:19:56.690 --> 00:20:01.179
Don’t try to push the – no, no, no, don’t
do that.

00:20:01.179 --> 00:20:02.730
No, no, don’t.

00:20:02.730 --> 00:20:05.340
You should not lose temper with children,
you know?

00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:22.390
They are crying, they must be wanting something.

00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:44.659
So, this knowledgeable instrument that you
have got is to be all the time flowing through

00:20:44.659 --> 00:20:50.220
you, and you have to be a very clean apparatus.

00:20:50.220 --> 00:21:01.250
Supposing you have this light, and the glass
is not clean – you won’t get light properly.

00:21:01.250 --> 00:21:12.220
So the purity has to be established, and that
is the part, where Ganesha is so important,

00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:22.279
because He cleanses you, He washes you and
you become innocent: because you do not plan

00:21:22.279 --> 00:21:30.919
or think of harming anyone, who is a good
person, who is a nice person.

00:21:30.919 --> 00:21:37.070
It becomes innocence because it is auspicious.

00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:39.360
You start becoming auspicious.

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:46.850
Wherever you go, and [if] you meet somebody
that person feels, “Oh God, today something

00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:49.039
good has happened in our family.

00:21:49.039 --> 00:21:52.299
Something good has come out.”

00:21:52.299 --> 00:21:59.279
Now recently I met someone in Germany where
there was a ‘sahaja yogi’ who started

00:21:59.279 --> 00:22:02.970
talking against Me and Sahaja Yoga.

00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:10.289
And he got out of the Ashram, and then he
went to somebody who was supposed to be a

00:22:10.289 --> 00:22:15.299
sahaja yogi, and his wife, and there he started
telling about his woes and, against Sahaja

00:22:15.299 --> 00:22:17.909
Yoga and all those things.

00:22:17.909 --> 00:22:23.249
Though he has been always a possessed man,
but still: these people should not have listened

00:22:23.249 --> 00:22:24.940
to anything against Me.

00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:31.740
In the shastras is written, that: to hear
the Guru-ninda, anything against your Guru,

00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:34.389
is absolutely dangerous.

00:22:34.389 --> 00:22:38.809
So anybody says anything against your Guru,
you have to put your hands like that, “I

00:22:38.809 --> 00:22:42.029
don’t want to hear anything against my Guru!”

00:22:42.029 --> 00:22:43.460
Instead of that they sympathised.

00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:52.650
So the lady has got a serious type of cancer,
and the husband is also very sick.

00:22:52.650 --> 00:23:02.640
Now, one has to understand that if you are
going to cross this ocean in a boat – all

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:10.450
of us are there – and [if] one wants to
put one foot into the mouth of a crocodile,

00:23:10.450 --> 00:23:12.450
how can we save such people?

00:23:12.450 --> 00:23:19.110
Then it’s better that they should go to
the crocodile than to the boat.

00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:27.230
But those who try to sympathise and put another
foot in the crocodile, then they have to be

00:23:27.230 --> 00:23:34.230
in trouble.

00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:40.649
All these things not only hamper but are so
inauspicious and dangerous that you all have

00:23:40.649 --> 00:23:46.210
to be extremely careful about it.

00:23:46.210 --> 00:23:48.139
You need not tell people that, “You are
evil!

00:23:48.139 --> 00:23:51.989
You are bad!“, or anything – but just
“Get out of Sahaja Yoga!”

00:23:51.989 --> 00:23:53.049
Have nothing to do with them.

00:23:53.049 --> 00:23:54.460
You should say, “We are sorry.

00:23:54.460 --> 00:23:56.389
We can’t to anything about it.

00:23:56.389 --> 00:23:57.529
You do what you like.

00:23:57.529 --> 00:24:00.419
It’s not our responsibility.”

00:24:00.419 --> 00:24:06.720
And there you should not be meek, you should
not feel embarrassed or delicate about it.

00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:08.809
Tell them off, “Nothing doing.

00:24:08.809 --> 00:24:16.490
We cannot help you here, we are sorry, you
work it out yourself.”

00:24:16.490 --> 00:24:25.330
Because this light is a light which nourishes
you and strengthens you.

00:24:25.330 --> 00:24:31.230
The light of the Spirit must give you that
strength within you.

00:24:31.230 --> 00:24:34.200
You become a strong personality.

00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:44.059
You become a personality which can withstand
lots of things, even crucifixion, but it can

00:24:44.059 --> 00:24:46.149
also fight.

00:24:46.149 --> 00:24:53.250
It has all the qualities built within itself.

00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:56.429
Like a person who has a temper.

00:24:56.429 --> 00:24:57.429
No!

00:24:57.429 --> 00:24:59.919
It’s not a very good person to be, with
temper.

00:24:59.919 --> 00:25:03.529
It’s not good for a Sahaja Yogi to have
temper.

00:25:03.529 --> 00:25:09.850
But if somebody says something to you against
your Mother, you have to have temper.

00:25:09.850 --> 00:25:13.559
That’s the place we have to use temper.

00:25:13.559 --> 00:25:17.580
You can box that person, doesn’t matter.

00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:24.220
(Laughter) Ganesha will be just standing behind
you.

00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:30.400
(Laughter) And Hanumana will be in front.

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:36.789
(Laughter) If you box him once, Hanumana will
box him ten times.

00:25:36.789 --> 00:25:44.179
(Laughter) So that time the anger has meaning.

00:25:44.179 --> 00:25:54.149
Now, people say, one should not have greed
in life.

00:25:54.149 --> 00:26:01.029
Yes, one should not have greed, but if you
have got greed for vibrations it’s a very

00:26:01.029 --> 00:26:02.690
good thing.

00:26:02.690 --> 00:26:05.549
You should be very greedy about vibrations.

00:26:05.549 --> 00:26:11.399
Wherever you get vibrations, you must rush
and try to get more vibrations.

00:26:11.399 --> 00:26:18.250
Greed is alright, you should have that greed
within yourself.

00:26:18.250 --> 00:26:25.929
If you don’t have that greed, how will you
be able to overcome the other attractions?

00:26:25.929 --> 00:26:30.129
It is very surprising, I always wonder about
human beings – which I’ve never been able

00:26:30.129 --> 00:26:32.980
to understand Myself.

00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:44.330
(Laughter) That, when it comes to hatred they
are the best!

00:26:44.330 --> 00:26:53.090
If they want to hate someone then you can
make them sacrifice everything that they have.

00:26:53.090 --> 00:26:59.090
Under the name of God, under the name of nation,
under the name of anything whatever you want.

00:26:59.090 --> 00:27:02.270
You just have to say that, “We have to hate
someone.”

00:27:02.270 --> 00:27:09.100
Immediately they’ll gather around, they’ll
pass trough all kinds of ordeals, sacrifice

00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:18.169
everything, go to jails, they will kill themselves,
commit suicides – just if you tell them,

00:27:18.169 --> 00:27:20.769
“We hate someone.”

00:27:20.769 --> 00:27:27.529
Or else you have to say that, “We are a
great nation, something very big and, these

00:27:27.529 --> 00:27:32.950
are bad nations – so we have to fight.”

00:27:32.950 --> 00:27:38.749
They will do.

00:27:38.749 --> 00:27:46.519
It is very surprising that, even when it comes
to political revolutions and for their political

00:27:46.519 --> 00:27:54.129
freedom, they can go to any limit of sacrifices.

00:27:54.129 --> 00:27:56.419
The other day I was watching Lenin’s fight.

00:27:56.419 --> 00:27:57.710
I was amazed!

00:27:57.710 --> 00:28:05.749
This single man Lenin, who was always in the
exile used to only write, “We have to fight,

00:28:05.749 --> 00:28:08.100
we have to get this, we have to do that.”

00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:14.929
Though he was a realised soul, but still he
didn’t write about spirituality, he wrote

00:28:14.929 --> 00:28:22.039
about political struggle, and three times
there was an upsurge and thousands and thousands

00:28:22.039 --> 00:28:32.210
of people you find in every place being killed
– just like that.

00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:33.210
It is very surprising.

00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:41.260
Now, don’t fan, you see, while I am talking
you should not fan, you know, it disturbs.

00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:46.190
Pay full attention; pay full attention, is
important.

00:28:46.190 --> 00:28:52.940
Because if you do not pay attention, others
will look at you, and their attention will

00:28:52.940 --> 00:28:53.940
be spoiled.

00:28:53.940 --> 00:29:01.720
Now this one was so dedicated, even little
children and wives and pregnant women and

00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:06.769
so many men were killed in a lot like that.

00:29:06.769 --> 00:29:12.559
Again they rose, again they rose three times,
and the fourth time they were successful.

00:29:12.559 --> 00:29:15.490
For what?

00:29:15.490 --> 00:29:19.299
For a political achievement.

00:29:19.299 --> 00:29:24.049
We did that in India, too.

00:29:24.049 --> 00:29:29.080
People gave up everything that they have,
their houses, families – everything they

00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:31.080
gave up.

00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:37.669
Even for fake gurus people have spent so much
money, they have done so much, given up everything,

00:29:37.669 --> 00:29:42.190
sold their houses, put their children into
trouble, got into trouble – everything they

00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:43.320
did.

00:29:43.320 --> 00:30:01.000
But for the right thing, the wisest thing,
the only great thing that has to happen is

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:08.119
Sahaja Yoga – where comfort is pouring on
us all the time, where all kinds of joy is

00:30:08.119 --> 00:30:19.570
pouring on us, where everything is being smoothed
out for you – people become so fond of comfort,

00:30:19.570 --> 00:30:27.739
and this and that, that the slightest sacrifice
they can’t understand.

00:30:27.739 --> 00:30:32.829
They’ll come with problems about their wives,
about their children, about their husbands

00:30:32.829 --> 00:30:34.029
– everything solved.

00:30:34.029 --> 00:30:37.350
Now this goes on and on and on and on.

00:30:37.350 --> 00:30:38.590
Solve them!

00:30:38.590 --> 00:30:39.679
Finish them off!

00:30:39.679 --> 00:30:41.729
Cut them short!

00:30:41.729 --> 00:30:45.940
You have to spread Sahaja Yoga!

00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:51.359
You have to sacrifice some time, you have
to sacrifice some money also.

00:30:51.359 --> 00:30:56.429
Who is going to work it out?

00:30:56.429 --> 00:31:05.520
Nobody is going to kill you, as people were
killed in Russia, or in Germany, or in Poland.

00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:10.239
Nobody is going to take away your children
or to take away your money, or anything – no

00:31:10.239 --> 00:31:14.320
one wants it.

00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:22.260
But this light in your hand has to be burnt
with the true desire, the pure desire within

00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:26.090
you, is the Kundalini.

00:31:26.090 --> 00:31:34.279
That is the wick, that is the one has to be
kept absolutely nourished.

00:31:34.279 --> 00:31:37.940
And that is where sahaja yogis fail.

00:31:37.940 --> 00:31:40.779
People don’t want to leave Sahaja Yoga.

00:31:40.779 --> 00:31:43.199
Even if you tell them, “Please go away,
we can’t help!”

00:31:43.199 --> 00:31:44.959
– “No, no, no, I cannot leave Sahaja Yoga.”

00:31:44.959 --> 00:31:45.959
– “Why?”

00:31:45.959 --> 00:31:47.049
Because is a place of enjoyment.

00:31:47.049 --> 00:31:56.629
But it would be something different from human
beings, because human beings, if a human being

00:31:56.629 --> 00:32:04.700
gets a bottle of wine he’ll call ten more
to enjoy it.

00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:11.700
If a dog gets something to eat he’ll call
other dogs to eat it.

00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:16.320
If a crow gets something to eat he’ll call
other crows to eat it.

00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:18.909
Naturally built within them.

00:32:18.909 --> 00:32:21.509
Same with human beings.

00:32:21.509 --> 00:32:28.289
But when it comes to Sahaja Yoga we are not
that tenacious about it.

00:32:28.289 --> 00:32:32.979
We have to tell all our relations, “We are
Sahaja Yogis, and this is the religion of

00:32:32.979 --> 00:32:37.489
within, and this is what it is – if you
don’t want to follow I have nothing to do

00:32:37.489 --> 00:32:38.489
with you.

00:32:38.489 --> 00:32:40.139
Why don’t you follow it?”

00:32:40.139 --> 00:32:41.799
Everybody has got relations.

00:32:41.799 --> 00:32:50.840
So on a Diwali day, when we were talking about
our light, what are we going to do with this

00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:51.840
light?

00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:54.929
Are we going to use it only for our own purpose?

00:32:54.929 --> 00:33:05.289
Christ has said, you don’t put the light
under a – what you call it?

00:33:05.289 --> 00:33:06.499
– measure.

00:33:06.499 --> 00:33:11.629
You don’t put it under a measure.

00:33:11.629 --> 00:33:14.639
You put it on a table.

00:33:14.639 --> 00:33:18.200
We all have to come out in the public, we
have to find out ways and methods.

00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:24.260
It’s not only the leaders, everybody has
to work it out what we can do to spread Sahaja

00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:25.260
Yoga.

00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:29.190
In every place you go: how can we give Sahaja
Yoga?

00:33:29.190 --> 00:33:34.460
Of course I don’t want you to change your
dresses – but you can carry big badges.

00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:35.460
People will ask you.

00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:42.470
You should say, “Yes, this is the person
who has given us peace, joy and happiness.”

00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:47.409
Start talking like that, go to the markets,
go to public places.

00:33:47.409 --> 00:33:56.710
I go to market just to spread vibrations – you
all have to do that, otherwise you will have

00:33:56.710 --> 00:34:01.409
the Sahaja Yoga enjoyment to yourself , but
unless and until you share it you are not

00:34:01.409 --> 00:34:03.179
going to enjoy it fully.

00:34:03.179 --> 00:34:04.909
Look at Me.

00:34:04.909 --> 00:34:09.340
I have all the vibrations of the world.

00:34:09.340 --> 00:34:17.800
(Laughter) I have everything, I should be
such a self-contented person, sitting at home

00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:22.440
– in meditation.

00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:28.150
(Laughter) At this age, why should I travel
after all?

00:34:28.150 --> 00:34:35.260
(Laughter) I am the Adi Shakti – why should
I worry of making everybody such a powerful

00:34:35.260 --> 00:34:37.179
shakti people?

00:34:37.179 --> 00:34:40.690
There’s no need.

00:34:40.690 --> 00:34:50.502
I should enjoy My powers, I can, but I cannot.

00:34:50.502 --> 00:34:52.460
I have to work hard.

00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:56.970
I give the maximum time to Sahaja Yoga, than
any one of you can give.

00:34:56.970 --> 00:35:01.910
I have a family, I have got My husband.

00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:04.610
He has a life which is very, very busy life.

00:35:04.610 --> 00:35:06.300
I’ve got grandchildren.

00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:08.740
I give the maximum time.

00:35:08.740 --> 00:35:13.320
Now see, from here to Rome, then to France,
then to Spain.

00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:16.750
You all are having just a relay race.

00:35:16.750 --> 00:35:21.180
Alright, I am here – Italians are having
a little strain.

00:35:21.180 --> 00:35:24.680
Then they will relax!

00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:27.720
“Now alright…”

00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:32.480
(Laughter) Then, what do I do?

00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:36.910
All the year round I am going from places
to places…travelling.

00:35:36.910 --> 00:35:41.950
And when I have everything.

00:35:41.950 --> 00:35:53.280
Can you think of a rich man who is busy distributing
all the wealth he has, while the others take

00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:55.680
time to take it?

00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:58.490
That is what it is.

00:35:58.490 --> 00:36:07.410
So I have to tell you that you have to come
in a new dimension of your enthusiasm.

00:36:07.410 --> 00:36:11.680
Sahaja Yoga is not for our enjoyment alone.

00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:13.420
“We are saints,” so what!

00:36:13.420 --> 00:36:14.510
For what?

00:36:14.510 --> 00:36:16.800
For what you are made saints?

00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:21.250
It’s not that the men should only do, or
women should do, or this one should do, or

00:36:21.250 --> 00:36:23.090
that one should do.

00:36:23.090 --> 00:36:29.500
Don’t get involved into these temptations.

00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:36.130
There are thirteen temptations, which came
out of the churning.

00:36:36.130 --> 00:36:44.710
The fourteenth one was a big hunter to neutralise
all the thirteen.

00:36:44.710 --> 00:36:53.030
Not that Sahaja Yoga wants to tempt anyone,
but they become temptations because they are

00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:57.560
blessings to you, and blessings you start
using as temptations.

00:36:57.560 --> 00:37:10.370
Now, for anybody, to have such a temptation
would be more like a horse, which has to go

00:37:10.370 --> 00:37:18.250
to the south or to the north, is standing
and eating the grass.

00:37:18.250 --> 00:37:24.780
You have to move, movement is the point, you
have to move from places to places, you have

00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:29.320
to go from villages to villages, you have
to go from houses to houses.

00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:32.000
This message has to spread.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:37.450
Christ’s twelve disciples only – how much
religion they have created?

00:37:37.450 --> 00:37:42.960
Of course, it’s of no use, but still!

00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:46.330
You are going to give something so substantial
and so great.

00:37:46.330 --> 00:37:49.560
But when you tell them, then the way you tell
them is important.

00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:56.270
The way you assert is important.

00:37:56.270 --> 00:38:00.370
I don’t mind from today – you can tell
them what I am.

00:38:00.370 --> 00:38:01.610
Doesn’t matter.

00:38:01.610 --> 00:38:03.180
How long are we going to hide it?

00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:07.910
You better tell them that, “She is such
and such, it’s written in the Bible, She

00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:09.500
is such and such – we have found it.

00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:12.710
If you don’t want to see it, don’t see
it – but it is so.”

00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:23.290
Let’s have that determination and let’s
have that kind of a outspokenness.

00:38:23.290 --> 00:38:25.630
Look at these horrible politicians.

00:38:25.630 --> 00:38:32.060
They say, “I believe that there should be
some people who should be rich, the rest should

00:38:32.060 --> 00:38:33.060
be poor.

00:38:33.060 --> 00:38:34.760
I believe.

00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:37.260
I believe in this and I believe in that.”

00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:38.800
What about you?

00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:43.170
You do not only believe, but you know for
definite!

00:38:43.170 --> 00:38:54.330
And that’s what should be decided on a Diwali
day that by next Diwali we have to get many,

00:38:54.330 --> 00:38:55.960
many people for Sahaja Yoga.

00:38:55.960 --> 00:39:01.400
But when I speak, many people told Me that
they think I am not speaking to them [but]

00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:04.210
to somebody else.

00:39:04.210 --> 00:39:09.330
You should see to the people who are working
harder than you for Sahaja Yoga; who are involved

00:39:09.330 --> 00:39:14.240
more in Sahaja Yoga; those who are achieving
more in Sahaja Yoga – not the people who

00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:16.630
have done nothing.

00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:19.990
You can see Me.

00:39:19.990 --> 00:39:26.310
What are we doing?

00:39:26.310 --> 00:39:29.810
You should think about it.

00:39:29.810 --> 00:39:33.510
Where are we?

00:39:33.510 --> 00:39:37.540
This is the most important period.

00:39:37.540 --> 00:39:42.250
At the most, in Europe, I will be for five
years more, at the most.

00:39:42.250 --> 00:39:49.180
Do you think I’ll be travelling after seventy
years of age?

00:39:49.180 --> 00:39:52.220
No.

00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:57.500
So this is such an important time when I am
here, then I could meet people, I could talk

00:39:57.500 --> 00:40:00.310
to them, I can help you a lot.

00:40:00.310 --> 00:40:02.860
In these five years you have to achieve something.

00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:08.390
And you have to take a jump and give a speed
to yourself.

00:40:08.390 --> 00:40:14.990
Otherwise this is a very important time, will
be lost by all your fellow men.

00:40:14.990 --> 00:40:17.420
Like the other day we had program.

00:40:17.420 --> 00:40:22.290
I’ll tell you a practical side: now what,
I would do [is] take the addresses of all

00:40:22.290 --> 00:40:30.150
the people who got realisation, take it down,
write to them, go and see them, meet them.

00:40:30.150 --> 00:40:33.070
[Find out] what has happened, why didn’t
they come.

00:40:33.070 --> 00:40:39.830
Then make a statement, why people didn’t
come, what happened, why is he not coming.

00:40:39.830 --> 00:40:42.900
Write to them all the time.

00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:48.170
See you’ll be surprised if you take one
copy of ‘Reader’s Digest‘ (Magazine),

00:40:48.170 --> 00:40:51.250
only once – make a mistake.

00:40:51.250 --> 00:40:59.320
(Laughter) – they go on sending you so many
types of things, you know?

00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:05.330
(Laughter) You will get this present, you’ll
get – this is a car free for you, this thing

00:41:05.330 --> 00:41:06.330
for you.

00:41:06.330 --> 00:41:07.330
Who wants it?

00:41:07.330 --> 00:41:08.390
But they go on sending.

00:41:08.390 --> 00:41:10.900
I have written to them, “Don’t send Me
anything.

00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:11.900
I don’t want any car – nothing.

00:41:11.900 --> 00:41:15.600
You just send Me Reader’s Digest, thank
you very much.

00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:18.580
I’m not a lucky person.

00:41:18.580 --> 00:41:20.960
Please don’t send.”

00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:24.140
Still they are sending!

00:41:24.140 --> 00:41:25.730
(Laughter & applause)

00:41:25.730 --> 00:41:29.620
In this way you must write to them all the
time, “Why are you not coming to Mother?

00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:31.680
Why you are not coming to Sahaja Yoga?

00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:35.480
Sahaja Yoga is so important, it has given
me so much, why don’t you want to have it?”

00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:39.340
You must show that earnestness within you.

00:41:39.340 --> 00:41:44.770
And if you do not show that earnestness – take
it in a mundane way, “Alright, it’s going

00:41:44.770 --> 00:41:48.500
well, this, that, is good, alright, this is
improving, that is.”

00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:51.610
That’s not the way you are going to work
it out!

00:41:51.610 --> 00:41:56.720
Once I go to India I know in India it will
take no time.

00:41:56.720 --> 00:42:00.950
India will work out very fast.

00:42:00.950 --> 00:42:09.900
And you have to book your seats in the heaven,
that’s very important.

00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:17.290
I mean, even for an aeroplane you have to
book a seat; then what about heaven?

00:42:17.290 --> 00:42:21.170
(Laughter) And so many have to book the seats.

00:42:21.170 --> 00:42:27.250
If all Indians are sitting there, what will
you do?

00:42:27.250 --> 00:42:31.160
(Laughter)

00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:39.790
So with this joy, with this happiness, with
this light on our face, with this beauty of

00:42:39.790 --> 00:42:43.780
enlightenment you are all gurus.

00:42:43.780 --> 00:42:47.770
Imagine, these useless [false] gurus know
nothing, their Kundalini is not awakened,

00:42:47.770 --> 00:42:51.560
nothing of that kind – and how much they
have built up their empires after empires.

00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:58.500
I don’t say that you build up empires, no,
not that way, but why not build up at least

00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:06.570
a hut to show that you have achieved something
and it has to be done.

00:43:06.570 --> 00:43:10.770
Talk to everyone in your office, in your this
thing, not to feel shy.

00:43:10.770 --> 00:43:15.020
I have seen people put up these horrible peoples’
photographs everywhere.

00:43:15.020 --> 00:43:19.710
In their office you go, you find them; in
the buses you find them; everywhere they are

00:43:19.710 --> 00:43:20.710
hanging.

00:43:20.710 --> 00:43:23.230
Why not My photograph?

00:43:23.230 --> 00:43:28.620
So the curiosity is there, people will ask
you, you tell them – it will work out.

00:43:28.620 --> 00:43:31.790
The best thing is working out in Italy, surprisingly.

00:43:31.790 --> 00:43:37.010
And it will go ahead, because we found some
very good people and you should try to find

00:43:37.010 --> 00:43:39.330
out.

00:43:39.330 --> 00:43:43.320
Such people who are around – get after them
and work it out.

00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:47.440
But don’t go to wrong people, must use your
discretion.

00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:52.340
You know how these [false] gurus work – is
very important.

00:43:52.340 --> 00:43:57.670
My brother was telling Me that a lady from
this Muktananda – now the Muktananda is

00:43:57.670 --> 00:44:02.540
not there, there is another American girl,
American-styled Indian girl.

00:44:02.540 --> 00:44:10.040
So, this Muktananda lady (disciple), one English
lady came to his house, My brother’s house

00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:13.490
– and she was very sweet, “I want to see
you, Sir,” – this, that.

00:44:13.490 --> 00:44:14.960
And she saw My photograph.

00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:17.360
So she said, “What is this Mataji doing
here?”

00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:18.360
He said, “Why?

00:44:18.360 --> 00:44:20.050
She is my sister.”

00:44:20.050 --> 00:44:24.410
She just bundled up everything and ran away.

00:44:24.410 --> 00:44:27.560
So My brother called her, “Please, come
along, sit down, sit down.

00:44:27.560 --> 00:44:28.560
What do you do?”

00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:33.690
She said, “No Sir, we see – we always
go and meet all the important people of the

00:44:33.690 --> 00:44:36.500
city, talk to them about it.”

00:44:36.500 --> 00:44:39.030
He said, “Yes.”

00:44:39.030 --> 00:44:42.360
And all the judges’ names were on the list.

00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:45.490
Immediately My brother took the telephone
and told them, “Have nothing to do with

00:44:45.490 --> 00:44:47.850
this woman!”

00:44:47.850 --> 00:44:51.580
But this is what it is.

00:44:51.580 --> 00:44:53.910
You should find out how to approach people.

00:44:53.910 --> 00:44:57.750
When I am there, there are – say – 200
people.

00:44:57.750 --> 00:44:59.490
When I go away, there are only 2 people.

00:44:59.490 --> 00:45:00.490
Why?

00:45:00.490 --> 00:45:01.490
What is the matter?

00:45:01.490 --> 00:45:03.940
Why they go away?

00:45:03.940 --> 00:45:06.790
There must be some reason.

00:45:06.790 --> 00:45:10.020
They don’t know Me.

00:45:10.020 --> 00:45:12.470
At least get their addresses.

00:45:12.470 --> 00:45:14.270
Find out who are these people.

00:45:14.270 --> 00:45:20.060
There’s no harm in getting their addresses
and finding out who they are.

00:45:20.060 --> 00:45:27.140
Then put them on the list and go on sending
letters to them, if not so much like Reader’s

00:45:27.140 --> 00:45:31.460
Digest, but something.

00:45:31.460 --> 00:45:36.700
When you will start sending letters to them,
you will be entered into their ignorance.

00:45:36.700 --> 00:45:39.600
The light will go in.

00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:43.810
Through your movement, your attention, the
light will go.

00:45:43.810 --> 00:45:47.660
You don’t know your attention, how powerful
it is.

00:45:47.660 --> 00:45:51.350
Once you start paying attention to them, the
light will pass through them.

00:45:51.350 --> 00:45:55.520
If not today, tomorrow they’ll come round.

00:45:55.520 --> 00:46:00.300
You can also send My photograph, “Try on
the photograph, this is the photograph, you

00:46:00.300 --> 00:46:02.410
came to the program, we are very happy.”

00:46:02.410 --> 00:46:07.900
Now if the follow-on doesn’t work out, try
this thing.

00:46:07.900 --> 00:46:14.900
And that’s the best way you can achieve
sometimes, but it is for you to think and

00:46:14.900 --> 00:46:19.120
understand – because you are human beings
and you know human beings.

00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:25.660
You just put yourself in the position of another
person – what would have appealed to you?

00:46:25.660 --> 00:46:35.630
There’s another thing I feel that people
should write books about Me.

00:46:35.630 --> 00:46:36.630
There’s no harm.

00:46:36.630 --> 00:46:40.760
But about Me, write the book about Me.

00:46:40.760 --> 00:46:46.040
But some people, who have a name, who have
in the society some name, who will be taken

00:46:46.040 --> 00:46:51.980
up seriously – they can write a book about
Me.

00:46:51.980 --> 00:46:56.190
They write books about everyone, why can’t
you write a book about Me?

00:46:56.190 --> 00:47:00.640
Not about, you can write about Sahaja Yoga
in it – of course, but you can write about

00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:01.640
Me.

00:47:01.640 --> 00:47:06.240
Telling people of such and such person is
there, and this is the solution, this is the

00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:07.240
hope.

00:47:07.240 --> 00:47:08.240
Why not?

00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:12.030
They write about all these horrible gurus,
why can’t you write about Me?

00:47:12.030 --> 00:47:16.650
But the person has to be a well known person.

00:47:16.650 --> 00:47:25.000
Now supposing you write a book, somebody else
can publish in his name – if you are a good

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:26.000
writer.

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:28.290
Somebody else can edit it and publish it.

00:47:28.290 --> 00:47:30.190
We can do that way.

00:47:30.190 --> 00:47:36.190
There are so many ways and methods by which
you can bring to the notice of the people

00:47:36.190 --> 00:47:37.670
that this is Sahaja Yoga.

00:47:37.670 --> 00:47:40.760
How many people know about Sahaja Yoga?

00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:45.660
A person comes out of jail, from India, walks
out and here it is.

00:47:45.660 --> 00:47:55.400
Very well known ‘guru’ sitting in some
corner of some dirty lane in America somewhere,

00:47:55.400 --> 00:47:56.800
and is a very well known person.

00:47:56.800 --> 00:48:08.930
They are all very well known – how?

00:48:08.930 --> 00:48:14.180
And it is not always that these things are
done through money, they are done through

00:48:14.180 --> 00:48:19.490
people doing their own deliberation.

00:48:19.490 --> 00:48:24.410
But these deliberations may be mesmerising,
bhootish, I agree.

00:48:24.410 --> 00:48:29.380
I do understand that you are free people,
to do what you like, but in your freedom you

00:48:29.380 --> 00:48:31.560
have to realise.

00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:36.370
And this is what today you all have to decide
that this is the light we have got, this has

00:48:36.370 --> 00:48:43.810
to be made into a beacon, not just a light,
a tinted light like that; what’s the use?

00:48:43.810 --> 00:48:47.820
We have to be like a beautiful tower of light.

00:48:47.820 --> 00:48:53.170
Like a lighthouse.

00:48:53.170 --> 00:48:57.050
And everybody should work it out within and
without.

00:48:57.050 --> 00:48:59.950
Within though you have worked out, without
you must work now.

00:48:59.950 --> 00:49:04.510
And secondly there’s a deepawali, it is
not only one light.

00:49:04.510 --> 00:49:08.120
So we have to be all collective, try to get
to collective life.

00:49:08.120 --> 00:49:13.280
Whenever it is possible, try to attend all
that is collective; try to be there, where

00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:14.480
there is collective happenings.

00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:20.250
There, where it is collective, this source
of energy flows better.

00:49:20.250 --> 00:49:24.590
May God bless you all!
