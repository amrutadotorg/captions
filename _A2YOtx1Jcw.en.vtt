WEBVTT

00:05.080 --> 00:27.710
First – we bow to Shri Ganesha
because Shri Ganesha is the source of innocence

00:27.710 --> 00:29.619
within us.

00:29.619 --> 00:39.360
So actually we bow to innocence within us.

00:39.360 --> 00:52.750
And this innocence is the one [that] gives
you the enlightenment.

00:52.750 --> 01:09.010
As I told you yesterday the light has innocence,
but this is innocent without knowledge.

01:09.010 --> 01:15.660
But your light is innocent with knowledge.

01:15.660 --> 01:23.860
We always think that the people who have got
knowledge can never be innocent, can never

01:23.860 --> 01:26.350
be simple.

01:26.350 --> 01:34.430
And the idea we have got about innocence is
that a innocent person is always deceived,

01:34.430 --> 01:44.080
can be befooled – and can be always taken
for granted.

01:44.080 --> 01:57.830
But innocence is a power; it is a power which
protects you, which gives you light of knowledge.

01:57.830 --> 02:10.390
Knowledge that we have in the worldly sense
is how to exploit others, how to cheat others,

02:10.390 --> 02:25.280
how to make money out of them, how to make
fun of others, how to look down upon others.

02:25.280 --> 02:34.680
But the light of innocence is the light by
which you know that love is the highest thing.

02:34.680 --> 02:46.670
And it teaches you how to love others, how
to care for others, how to be gentle about

02:46.670 --> 02:47.780
others.

02:47.780 --> 02:51.280
It also gives you the light within.

02:51.280 --> 02:56.940
It’s just the other way round of this Avidya
that we have in this world.

02:56.940 --> 02:59.709
Just the other way round.

02:59.709 --> 03:15.200
The Avidya outside teaches us competition,
how to put the other person down.

03:15.200 --> 03:22.420
Because it has fear, it is insecured.

03:22.420 --> 03:28.069
This knowledge is not secured – at all.

03:28.069 --> 03:35.010
If it had security it would not have behaved
like this.

03:35.010 --> 03:40.110
But the light of innocence knows everything.

03:40.110 --> 03:45.270
It has no fear.

03:45.270 --> 03:54.040
When we say ‘children are innocent’ we
mean to say that they have that power of innocence.

03:54.040 --> 04:02.840
Many times people have noticed if a child
falls from a height, it doesn’t die; while

04:02.840 --> 04:10.319
a young man may die with a much smaller height.

04:10.319 --> 04:12.480
And the child is not afraid while falling.

04:12.480 --> 04:22.770
He just enjoys, as if there is a parachute
coming down, you know, nicely.

04:22.770 --> 04:26.770
And then when he falls down, also he just
gets up, laughs, smiles at everyone.

04:26.770 --> 04:32.580
He doesn’t understand why everybody is worried.

04:32.580 --> 04:38.849
Because in that innocence he knows that he’s
looked after, he’s protected.

04:38.849 --> 04:48.839
He knows that there is a power, which is much
higher than him and he does not have to worry.

04:48.839 --> 04:56.729
Then we start putting ideas into the head
of the child, and that is how he starts losing

04:56.729 --> 05:10.189
his power of innocence and he becomes a coward,
he becomes a cunning fellow, he becomes an

05:10.189 --> 05:17.189
unrighteous personality.

05:17.189 --> 05:27.349
But still we would say that the innocence
of children is [the] innocence of ignorance,

05:27.349 --> 05:35.499
in a way, because they do not know the dangers
of life.

05:35.499 --> 05:48.589
But the light of innocence knows all the dangers,
and also knows how to get rid of it, also

05:48.589 --> 05:53.070
knows how to be away from such a person.

05:53.070 --> 06:09.169
There was a wise man, who was going on a staircase,
and there was a stupid man coming from the

06:09.169 --> 06:12.410
other side – foolish man.

06:12.410 --> 06:18.569
So foolish people are always aggressive, that
is one of the signs, because they have inferiority

06:18.569 --> 06:20.289
complex.

06:20.289 --> 06:27.160
So the foolish man says to the man who was
coming up, he says – [because] one had to

06:27.160 --> 06:32.699
move on one side – so he says, “I don’t
move for fools!”

06:32.699 --> 06:36.449
The foolish one says.

06:36.449 --> 06:43.710
So the wise man says, “I do,” and he moved.

06:43.710 --> 06:57.021
(Laughter) That’s how the light of innocence
tells you how far to go with a person, how

06:57.021 --> 07:06.719
far to talk to a person, how far to indulge
in another person’s personality or his problems;

07:06.719 --> 07:09.249
otherwise he recedes.

07:09.249 --> 07:14.439
He understands that this gentleman is a stupid
fool so “I move for a fool like that.”

07:14.439 --> 07:22.429
He doesn’t pay attention to such a person,
he doesn’t bother about such a person.

07:22.429 --> 07:28.429
This is the light of innocence which gives
you discrimination.

07:28.429 --> 07:29.819
How far to go with others.

07:29.819 --> 07:34.219
I love a person, there are many, “I love
him”.

07:34.219 --> 07:35.219
Alright!

07:35.219 --> 07:41.179
The another person may kick you, may hit you,
may trouble you, may become absolutely horribly

07:41.179 --> 07:50.990
possessed, but still you are just mad in love
with that person, without any self-respect.

07:50.990 --> 07:57.839
This comes because there is no…you may be
innocent, in a way, in a worldly manner, but

07:57.839 --> 08:00.300
you are not enlightened and innocent.

08:00.300 --> 08:07.759
When you are enlightened and innocent then
your innocence is a power, which gives you,

08:07.759 --> 08:13.419
first thing, is discretion.

08:13.419 --> 08:20.069
Supposing you take a light in your hand – now
you know whether it is a snake or a rope,

08:20.069 --> 08:24.009
but if there is no light in your hand, you
cannot see.

08:24.009 --> 08:30.379
But even, supposing it’s a snake, you might
run away, or if you are a stupid fool, you’ll

08:30.379 --> 08:31.999
say, “Alright, come and bite me.

08:31.999 --> 08:39.410
I would like to see, how it works.”

08:39.410 --> 08:44.030
(Child laughs.

08:44.030 --> 08:52.650
Laughter) But if you are an enlightened person,
then you will tell the snake, “Now, let

08:52.650 --> 08:53.870
me be alone.

08:53.870 --> 08:54.870
Alright?

08:54.870 --> 08:55.870
Bye-bye.”

08:55.870 --> 09:00.340
(Laughter) And the snake will know and it
will go away.

09:00.340 --> 09:08.870
Or if the snake is a sinister one, you may
just look at the snake and snake might run

09:08.870 --> 09:10.020
off.

09:10.020 --> 09:18.620
So this power of innocence is a very, very
important thing, and that comes to us through

09:18.620 --> 09:22.210
our enlightenment alone.

09:22.210 --> 09:33.830
So we are, say, in a state which is ignorant
and innocent – innocent and ignorant.

09:33.830 --> 09:40.920
Then people are no more innocent nor ignorant,
but they are not enlightened – they become

09:40.920 --> 09:41.920
cunning!

09:41.920 --> 09:49.640
If they don’t have both the qualities – they
are neither ignorant, so-called, they have

09:49.640 --> 09:56.260
got knowledge, they are good at everything,
they are well known people, for their intelligence,

09:56.260 --> 09:59.940
brilliance, everything – so they are knowledgeable,
so-called.

09:59.940 --> 10:06.840
So such people we could call as the people
who have got the knowledge, in the worldly

10:06.840 --> 10:11.850
sense, but they have no innocence.

10:11.850 --> 10:17.470
So they start devising methods, the innocence
which is there, which puts a little control

10:17.470 --> 10:21.280
over such a mind, is lost.

10:21.280 --> 10:23.240
Because they think innocence is stupid, you
know?

10:23.240 --> 10:25.380
They don’t respect their innocence.

10:25.380 --> 10:32.380
So they start manoeuvring people, doing violent
things, doing harmful things, saying nasty,

10:32.380 --> 10:33.640
sarcastic things.

10:33.640 --> 10:42.310
All these things the brain starts working,
because it cannot get back to its innocence.

10:42.310 --> 10:45.770
So we don’t like such people later on, we
don’t want them.

10:45.770 --> 10:52.730
Then they develop ideas that, “We are higher
people, we are chosen people, we are better

10:52.730 --> 10:55.050
people,” then – they develop all these
ideas.

10:55.050 --> 10:58.200
Then they, all of them club together.

10:58.200 --> 11:04.420
So ignorance is added as a so-called knowledge,
you see.

11:04.420 --> 11:09.030
Inside is completely ignorance, outside is
knowledge.

11:09.030 --> 11:16.270
And added up – added up like that, they
do not want to seek their inside.

11:16.270 --> 11:24.050
And they are satisfied with their outside,
so-called knowledge.

11:24.050 --> 11:29.230
And they go ahead with it, and once they break
their heads, then they realise, “Oh God,

11:29.230 --> 11:30.500
what was it?

11:30.500 --> 11:34.690
Inside is all darkness.”

11:34.690 --> 11:45.800
We cannot live with all the windows closed
hermetically and the sun shining outside.

11:45.800 --> 11:56.400
We have to have light inside, to see for ourselves,
what are we, what are our powers, how far

11:56.400 --> 12:07.550
we can go, how we are working out ourselves,
our lives, our aims?

12:07.550 --> 12:17.410
Now the enlightenment, as the enlightenment
you see here is of these lights, is manifested

12:17.410 --> 12:27.180
within you as vibrations, as chaitanya, as
light.

12:27.180 --> 12:32.300
So the chaitanya itself is the light.

12:32.300 --> 12:40.310
But the difference between this light and
that light is such that this one will only

12:40.310 --> 12:44.930
tell you as far as your eyes are concerned.

12:44.930 --> 12:53.090
It will tell you that it is a stone, or it
is a wood, or it is a house, or it is a face

12:53.090 --> 13:03.490
of a man – anything, this light, but it
won’t be able to tell you whether this person

13:03.490 --> 13:12.180
is good or bad, whether this house is vibrated
or not, is auspicious or not.

13:12.180 --> 13:16.490
So it doesn’t give you auspiciousness, the
idea of auspiciousness.

13:16.490 --> 13:22.210
So we are talking of Ganesha’s innocence,
which gives us sense of auspiciousness, and

13:22.210 --> 13:28.930
ourselves also makes us auspicious.

13:28.930 --> 13:43.130
This is how the chaitanya itself is enlightenment,
chaitanya itself is enlightenment.

13:43.130 --> 13:50.000
It relates to you all the knowledge which
it has.

13:50.000 --> 13:57.890
Now imagine what a micro-arrangement it is
that the chaitanyas, which are small, small

13:57.890 --> 14:06.670
like, we can say, little round valayas, small,
small ones.

14:06.670 --> 14:18.230
They have intelligence in them, and discretion
built-in them to tell you whether a person

14:18.230 --> 14:23.200
is good or bad.

14:23.200 --> 14:27.310
You have got it, Sahaja Yoga, so in a simple
way.

14:27.310 --> 14:33.460
So we have not bothered to find out, what
your computer has got.

14:33.460 --> 14:42.900
It has got the knowledge now to know, not
only if the person is good or bad, but what

14:42.900 --> 14:46.270
troubles that person has got.

14:46.270 --> 14:58.650
Now this light can go up to one dimension
of a person, how he looks, how he walks, everything.

14:58.650 --> 15:11.120
And you, if you start imagining something,
if you start imagining – and saying that,

15:11.120 --> 15:14.670
“I feel this way, I think this way.”

15:14.670 --> 15:19.900
(somebody interrupts Mother’s talk)

15:19.900 --> 15:23.250
Shri Mataji: not all right?

15:23.250 --> 15:24.250
Yogini: [inaudible]

15:24.250 --> 15:25.250
Shri Mataji: Ha?

15:25.250 --> 15:26.250
Yogini: [inaudible]

15:26.250 --> 15:27.890
Shri Mataji: You can’t hear Me?

15:27.890 --> 15:29.210
Many yogis: Yes.

15:29.210 --> 15:31.850
Upstairs only in the baby school.

15:31.850 --> 15:34.040
Shri Mataji: What is it?

15:34.040 --> 15:40.990
Akbar: There is a video for the mothers with
the children, and they can’t hear You.

15:40.990 --> 15:43.850
It is upstairs.

15:43.850 --> 15:53.080
Shri Mataji: I didn’t hear, what is it?

15:53.080 --> 16:03.060
Antonio Scialo: There is a children-room upstairs,
for children, with a video for children and

16:03.060 --> 16:04.060
mothers.

16:04.060 --> 16:05.060
But they cannot hear it.

16:05.060 --> 16:06.060
Shri Mataji: Oh I see, but the children are
here?

16:06.060 --> 16:09.870
Yogis: Babies, babies; mothers and babies.

16:09.870 --> 16:12.850
Shri Mataji: Oh God.

16:12.850 --> 16:25.540
Somebody has to go up and fix it up, isn’t
it?

16:25.540 --> 16:37.050
I think you should have tested it before,
isn’t it?

16:37.050 --> 16:38.980
Alright.

16:38.980 --> 16:55.430
So, the chaitanya that is within us, which
is flowing out, which we are receiving from

16:55.430 --> 17:13.059
all over, is all-pervading, is in every molecule
pulsating: which gives us knowledge about

17:13.059 --> 17:21.659
each and every matter, each and every animal,
each and every human being, and each and every

17:21.659 --> 17:25.519
Deity.

17:25.519 --> 17:36.159
Without this light you could not have recognised
Me.

17:36.159 --> 17:40.750
You could not have recognised any Deities.

17:40.750 --> 17:48.250
You could not have known your position in
life and your aims in life.

17:48.250 --> 17:54.749
You would not have known what is your purpose
of life, why are you here.

17:54.749 --> 17:58.490
Are you here just to make some money, put
some in the insurance, some in the shares?

17:58.490 --> 17:59.490
Of course, now nobody will do that!

17:59.490 --> 18:05.091
(The stock markets crashed on Monday 19 October
1987 the week of this puja) (Laughter) And

18:05.091 --> 18:12.610
get some house, and dance on the fingers of
your wife, or the wife has to dance as the

18:12.610 --> 18:21.619
dictates of the husband, to bring up children
somehow – are you here for that?

18:21.619 --> 18:28.499
This chaitanya tells you, very clearly, “No.”

18:28.499 --> 18:40.740
Because if you get more involved into these
things and become completely cut-off from

18:40.740 --> 18:47.009
the collective happenings, then this light
goes off.

18:47.009 --> 18:55.529
As soon as this light gets disconnected, you
can’t have any light.

18:55.529 --> 19:10.740
So, any connection, whatever you have, with
the vibrations has to be very strong, and

19:10.740 --> 19:13.860
has to be absolutely intact and steady.

19:13.860 --> 19:21.190
For example, if there is a light which is
not steady, which is moving, you can’t understand

19:21.190 --> 19:24.049
things properly.

19:24.049 --> 19:33.009
Though the vibrations know everything, but
how will they communicate this to an instrument

19:33.009 --> 19:50.179
which is not perfect, which does not respect
vibrations, which does not communicate with

19:50.179 --> 19:54.940
the vibrations?

19:54.940 --> 19:56.690
Please take the child out.

19:56.690 --> 20:01.179
Don’t try to push the – no, no, no, don’t
do that.

20:01.179 --> 20:02.730
No, no, don’t.

20:02.730 --> 20:05.340
You should not lose temper with children,
you know?

20:05.340 --> 20:22.390
They are crying, they must be wanting something.

20:22.390 --> 20:44.659
So, this knowledgeable instrument that you
have got is to be all the time flowing through

20:44.659 --> 20:50.220
you, and you have to be a very clean apparatus.

20:50.220 --> 21:01.250
Supposing you have this light, and the glass
is not clean – you won’t get light properly.

21:01.250 --> 21:12.220
So the purity has to be established, and that
is the part, where Ganesha is so important,

21:12.220 --> 21:22.279
because He cleanses you, He washes you and
you become innocent: because you do not plan

21:22.279 --> 21:30.919
or think of harming anyone, who is a good
person, who is a nice person.

21:30.919 --> 21:37.070
It becomes innocence because it is auspicious.

21:37.070 --> 21:39.360
You start becoming auspicious.

21:39.360 --> 21:46.850
Wherever you go, and [if] you meet somebody
that person feels, “Oh God, today something

21:46.850 --> 21:49.039
good has happened in our family.

21:49.039 --> 21:52.299
Something good has come out.”

21:52.299 --> 21:59.279
Now recently I met someone in Germany where
there was a ‘sahaja yogi’ who started

21:59.279 --> 22:02.970
talking against Me and Sahaja Yoga.

22:02.970 --> 22:10.289
And he got out of the Ashram, and then he
went to somebody who was supposed to be a

22:10.289 --> 22:15.299
sahaja yogi, and his wife, and there he started
telling about his woes and, against Sahaja

22:15.299 --> 22:17.909
Yoga and all those things.

22:17.909 --> 22:23.249
Though he has been always a possessed man,
but still: these people should not have listened

22:23.249 --> 22:24.940
to anything against Me.

22:24.940 --> 22:31.740
In the shastras is written, that: to hear
the Guru-ninda, anything against your Guru,

22:31.740 --> 22:34.389
is absolutely dangerous.

22:34.389 --> 22:38.809
So anybody says anything against your Guru,
you have to put your hands like that, “I

22:38.809 --> 22:42.029
don’t want to hear anything against my Guru!”

22:42.029 --> 22:43.460
Instead of that they sympathised.

22:43.460 --> 22:52.650
So the lady has got a serious type of cancer,
and the husband is also very sick.

22:52.650 --> 23:02.640
Now, one has to understand that if you are
going to cross this ocean in a boat – all

23:02.640 --> 23:10.450
of us are there – and [if] one wants to
put one foot into the mouth of a crocodile,

23:10.450 --> 23:12.450
how can we save such people?

23:12.450 --> 23:19.110
Then it’s better that they should go to
the crocodile than to the boat.

23:19.110 --> 23:27.230
But those who try to sympathise and put another
foot in the crocodile, then they have to be

23:27.230 --> 23:34.230
in trouble.

23:34.230 --> 23:40.649
All these things not only hamper but are so
inauspicious and dangerous that you all have

23:40.649 --> 23:46.210
to be extremely careful about it.

23:46.210 --> 23:48.139
You need not tell people that, “You are
evil!

23:48.139 --> 23:51.989
You are bad!“, or anything – but just
“Get out of Sahaja Yoga!”

23:51.989 --> 23:53.049
Have nothing to do with them.

23:53.049 --> 23:54.460
You should say, “We are sorry.

23:54.460 --> 23:56.389
We can’t to anything about it.

23:56.389 --> 23:57.529
You do what you like.

23:57.529 --> 24:00.419
It’s not our responsibility.”

24:00.419 --> 24:06.720
And there you should not be meek, you should
not feel embarrassed or delicate about it.

24:06.720 --> 24:08.809
Tell them off, “Nothing doing.

24:08.809 --> 24:16.490
We cannot help you here, we are sorry, you
work it out yourself.”

24:16.490 --> 24:25.330
Because this light is a light which nourishes
you and strengthens you.

24:25.330 --> 24:31.230
The light of the Spirit must give you that
strength within you.

24:31.230 --> 24:34.200
You become a strong personality.

24:34.200 --> 24:44.059
You become a personality which can withstand
lots of things, even crucifixion, but it can

24:44.059 --> 24:46.149
also fight.

24:46.149 --> 24:53.250
It has all the qualities built within itself.

24:53.250 --> 24:56.429
Like a person who has a temper.

24:56.429 --> 24:57.429
No!

24:57.429 --> 24:59.919
It’s not a very good person to be, with
temper.

24:59.919 --> 25:03.529
It’s not good for a Sahaja Yogi to have
temper.

25:03.529 --> 25:09.850
But if somebody says something to you against
your Mother, you have to have temper.

25:09.850 --> 25:13.559
That’s the place we have to use temper.

25:13.559 --> 25:17.580
You can box that person, doesn’t matter.

25:17.580 --> 25:24.220
(Laughter) Ganesha will be just standing behind
you.

25:24.220 --> 25:30.400
(Laughter) And Hanumana will be in front.

25:30.400 --> 25:36.789
(Laughter) If you box him once, Hanumana will
box him ten times.

25:36.789 --> 25:44.179
(Laughter) So that time the anger has meaning.

25:44.179 --> 25:54.149
Now, people say, one should not have greed
in life.

25:54.149 --> 26:01.029
Yes, one should not have greed, but if you
have got greed for vibrations it’s a very

26:01.029 --> 26:02.690
good thing.

26:02.690 --> 26:05.549
You should be very greedy about vibrations.

26:05.549 --> 26:11.399
Wherever you get vibrations, you must rush
and try to get more vibrations.

26:11.399 --> 26:18.250
Greed is alright, you should have that greed
within yourself.

26:18.250 --> 26:25.929
If you don’t have that greed, how will you
be able to overcome the other attractions?

26:25.929 --> 26:30.129
It is very surprising, I always wonder about
human beings – which I’ve never been able

26:30.129 --> 26:32.980
to understand Myself.

26:32.980 --> 26:44.330
(Laughter) That, when it comes to hatred they
are the best!

26:44.330 --> 26:53.090
If they want to hate someone then you can
make them sacrifice everything that they have.

26:53.090 --> 26:59.090
Under the name of God, under the name of nation,
under the name of anything whatever you want.

26:59.090 --> 27:02.270
You just have to say that, “We have to hate
someone.”

27:02.270 --> 27:09.100
Immediately they’ll gather around, they’ll
pass trough all kinds of ordeals, sacrifice

27:09.100 --> 27:18.169
everything, go to jails, they will kill themselves,
commit suicides – just if you tell them,

27:18.169 --> 27:20.769
“We hate someone.”

27:20.769 --> 27:27.529
Or else you have to say that, “We are a
great nation, something very big and, these

27:27.529 --> 27:32.950
are bad nations – so we have to fight.”

27:32.950 --> 27:38.749
They will do.

27:38.749 --> 27:46.519
It is very surprising that, even when it comes
to political revolutions and for their political

27:46.519 --> 27:54.129
freedom, they can go to any limit of sacrifices.

27:54.129 --> 27:56.419
The other day I was watching Lenin’s fight.

27:56.419 --> 27:57.710
I was amazed!

27:57.710 --> 28:05.749
This single man Lenin, who was always in the
exile used to only write, “We have to fight,

28:05.749 --> 28:08.100
we have to get this, we have to do that.”

28:08.100 --> 28:14.929
Though he was a realised soul, but still he
didn’t write about spirituality, he wrote

28:14.929 --> 28:22.039
about political struggle, and three times
there was an upsurge and thousands and thousands

28:22.039 --> 28:32.210
of people you find in every place being killed
– just like that.

28:32.210 --> 28:33.210
It is very surprising.

28:33.210 --> 28:41.260
Now, don’t fan, you see, while I am talking
you should not fan, you know, it disturbs.

28:41.260 --> 28:46.190
Pay full attention; pay full attention, is
important.

28:46.190 --> 28:52.940
Because if you do not pay attention, others
will look at you, and their attention will

28:52.940 --> 28:53.940
be spoiled.

28:53.940 --> 29:01.720
Now this one was so dedicated, even little
children and wives and pregnant women and

29:01.720 --> 29:06.769
so many men were killed in a lot like that.

29:06.769 --> 29:12.559
Again they rose, again they rose three times,
and the fourth time they were successful.

29:12.559 --> 29:15.490
For what?

29:15.490 --> 29:19.299
For a political achievement.

29:19.299 --> 29:24.049
We did that in India, too.

29:24.049 --> 29:29.080
People gave up everything that they have,
their houses, families – everything they

29:29.080 --> 29:31.080
gave up.

29:31.080 --> 29:37.669
Even for fake gurus people have spent so much
money, they have done so much, given up everything,

29:37.669 --> 29:42.190
sold their houses, put their children into
trouble, got into trouble – everything they

29:42.190 --> 29:43.320
did.

29:43.320 --> 30:01.000
But for the right thing, the wisest thing,
the only great thing that has to happen is

30:01.000 --> 30:08.119
Sahaja Yoga – where comfort is pouring on
us all the time, where all kinds of joy is

30:08.119 --> 30:19.570
pouring on us, where everything is being smoothed
out for you – people become so fond of comfort,

30:19.570 --> 30:27.739
and this and that, that the slightest sacrifice
they can’t understand.

30:27.739 --> 30:32.829
They’ll come with problems about their wives,
about their children, about their husbands

30:32.829 --> 30:34.029
– everything solved.

30:34.029 --> 30:37.350
Now this goes on and on and on and on.

30:37.350 --> 30:38.590
Solve them!

30:38.590 --> 30:39.679
Finish them off!

30:39.679 --> 30:41.729
Cut them short!

30:41.729 --> 30:45.940
You have to spread Sahaja Yoga!

30:45.940 --> 30:51.359
You have to sacrifice some time, you have
to sacrifice some money also.

30:51.359 --> 30:56.429
Who is going to work it out?

30:56.429 --> 31:05.520
Nobody is going to kill you, as people were
killed in Russia, or in Germany, or in Poland.

31:05.520 --> 31:10.239
Nobody is going to take away your children
or to take away your money, or anything – no

31:10.239 --> 31:14.320
one wants it.

31:14.320 --> 31:22.260
But this light in your hand has to be burnt
with the true desire, the pure desire within

31:22.260 --> 31:26.090
you, is the Kundalini.

31:26.090 --> 31:34.279
That is the wick, that is the one has to be
kept absolutely nourished.

31:34.279 --> 31:37.940
And that is where sahaja yogis fail.

31:37.940 --> 31:40.779
People don’t want to leave Sahaja Yoga.

31:40.779 --> 31:43.199
Even if you tell them, “Please go away,
we can’t help!”

31:43.199 --> 31:44.959
– “No, no, no, I cannot leave Sahaja Yoga.”

31:44.959 --> 31:45.959
– “Why?”

31:45.959 --> 31:47.049
Because is a place of enjoyment.

31:47.049 --> 31:56.629
But it would be something different from human
beings, because human beings, if a human being

31:56.629 --> 32:04.700
gets a bottle of wine he’ll call ten more
to enjoy it.

32:04.700 --> 32:11.700
If a dog gets something to eat he’ll call
other dogs to eat it.

32:11.700 --> 32:16.320
If a crow gets something to eat he’ll call
other crows to eat it.

32:16.320 --> 32:18.909
Naturally built within them.

32:18.909 --> 32:21.509
Same with human beings.

32:21.509 --> 32:28.289
But when it comes to Sahaja Yoga we are not
that tenacious about it.

32:28.289 --> 32:32.979
We have to tell all our relations, “We are
Sahaja Yogis, and this is the religion of

32:32.979 --> 32:37.489
within, and this is what it is – if you
don’t want to follow I have nothing to do

32:37.489 --> 32:38.489
with you.

32:38.489 --> 32:40.139
Why don’t you follow it?”

32:40.139 --> 32:41.799
Everybody has got relations.

32:41.799 --> 32:50.840
So on a Diwali day, when we were talking about
our light, what are we going to do with this

32:50.840 --> 32:51.840
light?

32:51.840 --> 32:54.929
Are we going to use it only for our own purpose?

32:54.929 --> 33:05.289
Christ has said, you don’t put the light
under a – what you call it?

33:05.289 --> 33:06.499
– measure.

33:06.499 --> 33:11.629
You don’t put it under a measure.

33:11.629 --> 33:14.639
You put it on a table.

33:14.639 --> 33:18.200
We all have to come out in the public, we
have to find out ways and methods.

33:18.200 --> 33:24.260
It’s not only the leaders, everybody has
to work it out what we can do to spread Sahaja

33:24.260 --> 33:25.260
Yoga.

33:25.260 --> 33:29.190
In every place you go: how can we give Sahaja
Yoga?

33:29.190 --> 33:34.460
Of course I don’t want you to change your
dresses – but you can carry big badges.

33:34.460 --> 33:35.460
People will ask you.

33:35.460 --> 33:42.470
You should say, “Yes, this is the person
who has given us peace, joy and happiness.”

33:42.470 --> 33:47.409
Start talking like that, go to the markets,
go to public places.

33:47.409 --> 33:56.710
I go to market just to spread vibrations – you
all have to do that, otherwise you will have

33:56.710 --> 34:01.409
the Sahaja Yoga enjoyment to yourself , but
unless and until you share it you are not

34:01.409 --> 34:03.179
going to enjoy it fully.

34:03.179 --> 34:04.909
Look at Me.

34:04.909 --> 34:09.340
I have all the vibrations of the world.

34:09.340 --> 34:17.800
(Laughter) I have everything, I should be
such a self-contented person, sitting at home

34:17.800 --> 34:22.440
– in meditation.

34:22.440 --> 34:28.150
(Laughter) At this age, why should I travel
after all?

34:28.150 --> 34:35.260
(Laughter) I am the Adi Shakti – why should
I worry of making everybody such a powerful

34:35.260 --> 34:37.179
shakti people?

34:37.179 --> 34:40.690
There’s no need.

34:40.690 --> 34:50.502
I should enjoy My powers, I can, but I cannot.

34:50.502 --> 34:52.460
I have to work hard.

34:52.460 --> 34:56.970
I give the maximum time to Sahaja Yoga, than
any one of you can give.

34:56.970 --> 35:01.910
I have a family, I have got My husband.

35:01.910 --> 35:04.610
He has a life which is very, very busy life.

35:04.610 --> 35:06.300
I’ve got grandchildren.

35:06.300 --> 35:08.740
I give the maximum time.

35:08.740 --> 35:13.320
Now see, from here to Rome, then to France,
then to Spain.

35:13.320 --> 35:16.750
You all are having just a relay race.

35:16.750 --> 35:21.180
Alright, I am here – Italians are having
a little strain.

35:21.180 --> 35:24.680
Then they will relax!

35:24.680 --> 35:27.720
“Now alright…”

35:27.720 --> 35:32.480
(Laughter) Then, what do I do?

35:32.480 --> 35:36.910
All the year round I am going from places
to places…travelling.

35:36.910 --> 35:41.950
And when I have everything.

35:41.950 --> 35:53.280
Can you think of a rich man who is busy distributing
all the wealth he has, while the others take

35:53.280 --> 35:55.680
time to take it?

35:55.680 --> 35:58.490
That is what it is.

35:58.490 --> 36:07.410
So I have to tell you that you have to come
in a new dimension of your enthusiasm.

36:07.410 --> 36:11.680
Sahaja Yoga is not for our enjoyment alone.

36:11.680 --> 36:13.420
“We are saints,” so what!

36:13.420 --> 36:14.510
For what?

36:14.510 --> 36:16.800
For what you are made saints?

36:16.800 --> 36:21.250
It’s not that the men should only do, or
women should do, or this one should do, or

36:21.250 --> 36:23.090
that one should do.

36:23.090 --> 36:29.500
Don’t get involved into these temptations.

36:29.500 --> 36:36.130
There are thirteen temptations, which came
out of the churning.

36:36.130 --> 36:44.710
The fourteenth one was a big hunter to neutralise
all the thirteen.

36:44.710 --> 36:53.030
Not that Sahaja Yoga wants to tempt anyone,
but they become temptations because they are

36:53.030 --> 36:57.560
blessings to you, and blessings you start
using as temptations.

36:57.560 --> 37:10.370
Now, for anybody, to have such a temptation
would be more like a horse, which has to go

37:10.370 --> 37:18.250
to the south or to the north, is standing
and eating the grass.

37:18.250 --> 37:24.780
You have to move, movement is the point, you
have to move from places to places, you have

37:24.780 --> 37:29.320
to go from villages to villages, you have
to go from houses to houses.

37:29.320 --> 37:32.000
This message has to spread.

37:32.000 --> 37:37.450
Christ’s twelve disciples only – how much
religion they have created?

37:37.450 --> 37:42.960
Of course, it’s of no use, but still!

37:42.960 --> 37:46.330
You are going to give something so substantial
and so great.

37:46.330 --> 37:49.560
But when you tell them, then the way you tell
them is important.

37:49.560 --> 37:56.270
The way you assert is important.

37:56.270 --> 38:00.370
I don’t mind from today – you can tell
them what I am.

38:00.370 --> 38:01.610
Doesn’t matter.

38:01.610 --> 38:03.180
How long are we going to hide it?

38:03.180 --> 38:07.910
You better tell them that, “She is such
and such, it’s written in the Bible, She

38:07.910 --> 38:09.500
is such and such – we have found it.

38:09.500 --> 38:12.710
If you don’t want to see it, don’t see
it – but it is so.”

38:12.710 --> 38:23.290
Let’s have that determination and let’s
have that kind of a outspokenness.

38:23.290 --> 38:25.630
Look at these horrible politicians.

38:25.630 --> 38:32.060
They say, “I believe that there should be
some people who should be rich, the rest should

38:32.060 --> 38:33.060
be poor.

38:33.060 --> 38:34.760
I believe.

38:34.760 --> 38:37.260
I believe in this and I believe in that.”

38:37.260 --> 38:38.800
What about you?

38:38.800 --> 38:43.170
You do not only believe, but you know for
definite!

38:43.170 --> 38:54.330
And that’s what should be decided on a Diwali
day that by next Diwali we have to get many,

38:54.330 --> 38:55.960
many people for Sahaja Yoga.

38:55.960 --> 39:01.400
But when I speak, many people told Me that
they think I am not speaking to them [but]

39:01.400 --> 39:04.210
to somebody else.

39:04.210 --> 39:09.330
You should see to the people who are working
harder than you for Sahaja Yoga; who are involved

39:09.330 --> 39:14.240
more in Sahaja Yoga; those who are achieving
more in Sahaja Yoga – not the people who

39:14.240 --> 39:16.630
have done nothing.

39:16.630 --> 39:19.990
You can see Me.

39:19.990 --> 39:26.310
What are we doing?

39:26.310 --> 39:29.810
You should think about it.

39:29.810 --> 39:33.510
Where are we?

39:33.510 --> 39:37.540
This is the most important period.

39:37.540 --> 39:42.250
At the most, in Europe, I will be for five
years more, at the most.

39:42.250 --> 39:49.180
Do you think I’ll be travelling after seventy
years of age?

39:49.180 --> 39:52.220
No.

39:52.220 --> 39:57.500
So this is such an important time when I am
here, then I could meet people, I could talk

39:57.500 --> 40:00.310
to them, I can help you a lot.

40:00.310 --> 40:02.860
In these five years you have to achieve something.

40:02.860 --> 40:08.390
And you have to take a jump and give a speed
to yourself.

40:08.390 --> 40:14.990
Otherwise this is a very important time, will
be lost by all your fellow men.

40:14.990 --> 40:17.420
Like the other day we had program.

40:17.420 --> 40:22.290
I’ll tell you a practical side: now what,
I would do [is] take the addresses of all

40:22.290 --> 40:30.150
the people who got realisation, take it down,
write to them, go and see them, meet them.

40:30.150 --> 40:33.070
[Find out] what has happened, why didn’t
they come.

40:33.070 --> 40:39.830
Then make a statement, why people didn’t
come, what happened, why is he not coming.

40:39.830 --> 40:42.900
Write to them all the time.

40:42.900 --> 40:48.170
See you’ll be surprised if you take one
copy of ‘Reader’s Digest‘ (Magazine),

40:48.170 --> 40:51.250
only once – make a mistake.

40:51.250 --> 40:59.320
(Laughter) – they go on sending you so many
types of things, you know?

40:59.320 --> 41:05.330
(Laughter) You will get this present, you’ll
get – this is a car free for you, this thing

41:05.330 --> 41:06.330
for you.

41:06.330 --> 41:07.330
Who wants it?

41:07.330 --> 41:08.390
But they go on sending.

41:08.390 --> 41:10.900
I have written to them, “Don’t send Me
anything.

41:10.900 --> 41:11.900
I don’t want any car – nothing.

41:11.900 --> 41:15.600
You just send Me Reader’s Digest, thank
you very much.

41:15.600 --> 41:18.580
I’m not a lucky person.

41:18.580 --> 41:20.960
Please don’t send.”

41:20.960 --> 41:24.140
Still they are sending!

41:24.140 --> 41:25.730
(Laughter & applause)

41:25.730 --> 41:29.620
In this way you must write to them all the
time, “Why are you not coming to Mother?

41:29.620 --> 41:31.680
Why you are not coming to Sahaja Yoga?

41:31.680 --> 41:35.480
Sahaja Yoga is so important, it has given
me so much, why don’t you want to have it?”

41:35.480 --> 41:39.340
You must show that earnestness within you.

41:39.340 --> 41:44.770
And if you do not show that earnestness – take
it in a mundane way, “Alright, it’s going

41:44.770 --> 41:48.500
well, this, that, is good, alright, this is
improving, that is.”

41:48.500 --> 41:51.610
That’s not the way you are going to work
it out!

41:51.610 --> 41:56.720
Once I go to India I know in India it will
take no time.

41:56.720 --> 42:00.950
India will work out very fast.

42:00.950 --> 42:09.900
And you have to book your seats in the heaven,
that’s very important.

42:09.900 --> 42:17.290
I mean, even for an aeroplane you have to
book a seat; then what about heaven?

42:17.290 --> 42:21.170
(Laughter) And so many have to book the seats.

42:21.170 --> 42:27.250
If all Indians are sitting there, what will
you do?

42:27.250 --> 42:31.160
(Laughter)

42:31.160 --> 42:39.790
So with this joy, with this happiness, with
this light on our face, with this beauty of

42:39.790 --> 42:43.780
enlightenment you are all gurus.

42:43.780 --> 42:47.770
Imagine, these useless [false] gurus know
nothing, their Kundalini is not awakened,

42:47.770 --> 42:51.560
nothing of that kind – and how much they
have built up their empires after empires.

42:51.560 --> 42:58.500
I don’t say that you build up empires, no,
not that way, but why not build up at least

42:58.500 --> 43:06.570
a hut to show that you have achieved something
and it has to be done.

43:06.570 --> 43:10.770
Talk to everyone in your office, in your this
thing, not to feel shy.

43:10.770 --> 43:15.020
I have seen people put up these horrible peoples’
photographs everywhere.

43:15.020 --> 43:19.710
In their office you go, you find them; in
the buses you find them; everywhere they are

43:19.710 --> 43:20.710
hanging.

43:20.710 --> 43:23.230
Why not My photograph?

43:23.230 --> 43:28.620
So the curiosity is there, people will ask
you, you tell them – it will work out.

43:28.620 --> 43:31.790
The best thing is working out in Italy, surprisingly.

43:31.790 --> 43:37.010
And it will go ahead, because we found some
very good people and you should try to find

43:37.010 --> 43:39.330
out.

43:39.330 --> 43:43.320
Such people who are around – get after them
and work it out.

43:43.320 --> 43:47.440
But don’t go to wrong people, must use your
discretion.

43:47.440 --> 43:52.340
You know how these [false] gurus work – is
very important.

43:52.340 --> 43:57.670
My brother was telling Me that a lady from
this Muktananda – now the Muktananda is

43:57.670 --> 44:02.540
not there, there is another American girl,
American-styled Indian girl.

44:02.540 --> 44:10.040
So, this Muktananda lady (disciple), one English
lady came to his house, My brother’s house

44:10.040 --> 44:13.490
– and she was very sweet, “I want to see
you, Sir,” – this, that.

44:13.490 --> 44:14.960
And she saw My photograph.

44:14.960 --> 44:17.360
So she said, “What is this Mataji doing
here?”

44:17.360 --> 44:18.360
He said, “Why?

44:18.360 --> 44:20.050
She is my sister.”

44:20.050 --> 44:24.410
She just bundled up everything and ran away.

44:24.410 --> 44:27.560
So My brother called her, “Please, come
along, sit down, sit down.

44:27.560 --> 44:28.560
What do you do?”

44:28.560 --> 44:33.690
She said, “No Sir, we see – we always
go and meet all the important people of the

44:33.690 --> 44:36.500
city, talk to them about it.”

44:36.500 --> 44:39.030
He said, “Yes.”

44:39.030 --> 44:42.360
And all the judges’ names were on the list.

44:42.360 --> 44:45.490
Immediately My brother took the telephone
and told them, “Have nothing to do with

44:45.490 --> 44:47.850
this woman!”

44:47.850 --> 44:51.580
But this is what it is.

44:51.580 --> 44:53.910
You should find out how to approach people.

44:53.910 --> 44:57.750
When I am there, there are – say – 200
people.

44:57.750 --> 44:59.490
When I go away, there are only 2 people.

44:59.490 --> 45:00.490
Why?

45:00.490 --> 45:01.490
What is the matter?

45:01.490 --> 45:03.940
Why they go away?

45:03.940 --> 45:06.790
There must be some reason.

45:06.790 --> 45:10.020
They don’t know Me.

45:10.020 --> 45:12.470
At least get their addresses.

45:12.470 --> 45:14.270
Find out who are these people.

45:14.270 --> 45:20.060
There’s no harm in getting their addresses
and finding out who they are.

45:20.060 --> 45:27.140
Then put them on the list and go on sending
letters to them, if not so much like Reader’s

45:27.140 --> 45:31.460
Digest, but something.

45:31.460 --> 45:36.700
When you will start sending letters to them,
you will be entered into their ignorance.

45:36.700 --> 45:39.600
The light will go in.

45:39.600 --> 45:43.810
Through your movement, your attention, the
light will go.

45:43.810 --> 45:47.660
You don’t know your attention, how powerful
it is.

45:47.660 --> 45:51.350
Once you start paying attention to them, the
light will pass through them.

45:51.350 --> 45:55.520
If not today, tomorrow they’ll come round.

45:55.520 --> 46:00.300
You can also send My photograph, “Try on
the photograph, this is the photograph, you

46:00.300 --> 46:02.410
came to the program, we are very happy.”

46:02.410 --> 46:07.900
Now if the follow-on doesn’t work out, try
this thing.

46:07.900 --> 46:14.900
And that’s the best way you can achieve
sometimes, but it is for you to think and

46:14.900 --> 46:19.120
understand – because you are human beings
and you know human beings.

46:19.120 --> 46:25.660
You just put yourself in the position of another
person – what would have appealed to you?

46:25.660 --> 46:35.630
There’s another thing I feel that people
should write books about Me.

46:35.630 --> 46:36.630
There’s no harm.

46:36.630 --> 46:40.760
But about Me, write the book about Me.

46:40.760 --> 46:46.040
But some people, who have a name, who have
in the society some name, who will be taken

46:46.040 --> 46:51.980
up seriously – they can write a book about
Me.

46:51.980 --> 46:56.190
They write books about everyone, why can’t
you write a book about Me?

46:56.190 --> 47:00.640
Not about, you can write about Sahaja Yoga
in it – of course, but you can write about

47:00.640 --> 47:01.640
Me.

47:01.640 --> 47:06.240
Telling people of such and such person is
there, and this is the solution, this is the

47:06.240 --> 47:07.240
hope.

47:07.240 --> 47:08.240
Why not?

47:08.240 --> 47:12.030
They write about all these horrible gurus,
why can’t you write about Me?

47:12.030 --> 47:16.650
But the person has to be a well known person.

47:16.650 --> 47:25.000
Now supposing you write a book, somebody else
can publish in his name – if you are a good

47:25.000 --> 47:26.000
writer.

47:26.000 --> 47:28.290
Somebody else can edit it and publish it.

47:28.290 --> 47:30.190
We can do that way.

47:30.190 --> 47:36.190
There are so many ways and methods by which
you can bring to the notice of the people

47:36.190 --> 47:37.670
that this is Sahaja Yoga.

47:37.670 --> 47:40.760
How many people know about Sahaja Yoga?

47:40.760 --> 47:45.660
A person comes out of jail, from India, walks
out and here it is.

47:45.660 --> 47:55.400
Very well known ‘guru’ sitting in some
corner of some dirty lane in America somewhere,

47:55.400 --> 47:56.800
and is a very well known person.

47:56.800 --> 48:08.930
They are all very well known – how?

48:08.930 --> 48:14.180
And it is not always that these things are
done through money, they are done through

48:14.180 --> 48:19.490
people doing their own deliberation.

48:19.490 --> 48:24.410
But these deliberations may be mesmerising,
bhootish, I agree.

48:24.410 --> 48:29.380
I do understand that you are free people,
to do what you like, but in your freedom you

48:29.380 --> 48:31.560
have to realise.

48:31.560 --> 48:36.370
And this is what today you all have to decide
that this is the light we have got, this has

48:36.370 --> 48:43.810
to be made into a beacon, not just a light,
a tinted light like that; what’s the use?

48:43.810 --> 48:47.820
We have to be like a beautiful tower of light.

48:47.820 --> 48:53.170
Like a lighthouse.

48:53.170 --> 48:57.050
And everybody should work it out within and
without.

48:57.050 --> 48:59.950
Within though you have worked out, without
you must work now.

48:59.950 --> 49:04.510
And secondly there’s a deepawali, it is
not only one light.

49:04.510 --> 49:08.120
So we have to be all collective, try to get
to collective life.

49:08.120 --> 49:13.280
Whenever it is possible, try to attend all
that is collective; try to be there, where

49:13.280 --> 49:14.480
there is collective happenings.

49:14.480 --> 49:20.250
There, where it is collective, this source
of energy flows better.

49:20.250 --> 49:24.590
May God bless you all!
