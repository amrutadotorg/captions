00:00:06.307 --> 00:00:13.227
And the joy has no value.

00:00:13.988 --> 00:00:20.556
We cannot evaluate in any human terminology

00:00:20.656 --> 00:00:31.088
nor can we describe it as to how we feel the joy of oneness together.

00:00:31.188 --> 00:00:37.587
This togetherness is very much felt in Ganapatipule.

00:00:37.742 --> 00:00:45.639
I see the leaders from all over the
world have become great friends.

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:50.848
There’s no jealousy, there’s no quarrelling, there’s no
fighting, there’s no domination,

00:00:50.948 --> 00:00:53.042
there’s no shouting, nothing.

00:00:53.142 --> 00:00:57.686
Such beautiful brothers and sisters,

00:00:57.786 --> 00:01:10.128
such a beautiful family we have created 
out of this beautiful universe.

00:01:10.228 --> 00:01:17.157
Now we have to maintain the beauty individually and collectively.

00:01:17.257 --> 00:01:24.010
Some people think that individually
if you do something that is alright,

00:01:24.136 --> 00:01:29.292
but if it is not related to the collective it cannot be sahaja.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:39.960
Anything that you do has to be related to the collective.

00:01:41.182 --> 00:01:46.592
Now to be individualistic is a trend in the modern times

00:01:46.692 --> 00:01:53.867
and in that how far we have gone into nonsense that we know very well.

00:01:53.967 --> 00:01:59.785
Individuality is a personality within yourself

00:01:59.885 --> 00:02:08.143
which has to be of different hues, 
of different colours, of different beauties.

00:02:08.307 --> 00:02:15.245
Like if you see the flowers, 
now every flower is different and individual.

00:02:15.345 --> 00:02:23.617
In its beauty, in it’s softness, 
in it’s fragrance, in it’s form, in it’s colour

00:02:23.717 --> 00:02:35.319
every leaf is different, but they adorn
the whole forest, the whole garden

00:02:35.419 --> 00:02:42.247
in such a beautiful manner that the whole
thing works towards the collective.

00:02:42.347 --> 00:02:47.256
So the individuality is where we do not become like other people,

00:02:47.356 --> 00:02:54.019
exactly like military people as they are, the
outside people may become like military people

00:02:54.119 --> 00:03:03.726
but inside you become individual in
the sense everybody has a different way

00:03:03.826 --> 00:03:12.066
of pleasing others, of teasing others,
of loving others of saying beautiful things.

00:03:12.166 --> 00:03:24.613
Everybody has a style of saying nice things and of
offering your words of thanks and words of appreciation.

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:29.091
This individuality is to be developed by all of you.

00:03:29.218 --> 00:03:38.366
So if we could put our attention to this,
how we could be more beautiful inside,

00:03:38.466 --> 00:03:44.666
when we are touching others hearts, how we
could be very pure in our expression,

00:03:44.866 --> 00:03:47.878
genuine in our expression, not artificially.

00:03:47.978 --> 00:03:51.516
Like we have seen also that even we are superficial

00:03:51.616 --> 00:03:55.346
you’ll say ‘Thank you very much, thank
you very much, thank you very much’

00:03:55.446 --> 00:04:00.358
and you don’t mean it, it’s just a lip service
you don’t mean it.

00:04:00.458 --> 00:04:06.070
But in Sahaja Yoga when you want
to thank you see it is really heart felt

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:11.118
you say it from your heart, you have to put your
hand on your heart otherwise you just can’t say.

00:04:11.218 --> 00:04:17.558
it is that way that we should feel
and once you open that heart fully,

00:04:17.658 --> 00:04:20.800
opening of the heart is very important

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.439
and that, unless and until you can do it
you cannot enjoy anything in Sahaja Yoga

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:31.529
because the heart where resides the
Spirit and it is the Spirit that emits the joy.

00:04:31.658 --> 00:04:38.898
So if you do not have an open heart, and if you 
are just living on very superficial level

00:04:39.034 --> 00:04:41.618
you can never enjoy Sahaja Yoga,

00:04:41.718 --> 00:04:53.592
and this enjoyment of Sahaja Yoga is something 
 to be really achieved and to be enjoyed.

00:04:53.697 --> 00:04:57.977
Because that’s why you are here for, 
there’s nothing else to offer in Sahaja Yoga

00:04:58.137 --> 00:05:03.085
but the joy of life, and that is the essence 
of all the achievements of life.

00:05:03.185 --> 00:05:08.745
Everything we do for the joy, but everything 
whatever we do for joy after some time

00:05:08.978 --> 00:05:14.670
we find it becomes a sort of a reaction.

00:05:14.818 --> 00:05:20.771
So there is very important point
that to make our individuality beautiful

00:05:20.871 --> 00:05:27.303
we should not immediately react to people,

00:05:27.403 --> 00:05:31.979
should not give our own opinion ‘I don’t like it, I don’t
want it’,

00:05:32.079 --> 00:05:35.338
but we should absorb the beauty of another person.

00:05:35.459 --> 00:05:41.046
Now supposing there’s a flower you get,
immediately you will see the beauty of the flower,

00:05:41.146 --> 00:05:43.411
you like to take the fragrance of the flower

00:05:43.511 --> 00:05:49.478
but suddenly you say ‘I don’t like flowers’ 
then what can the flower do to you?

00:05:49.578 --> 00:05:53.156
So one should not react and one should not have such subtle idea

00:05:53.256 --> 00:05:59.838
about your likes and dislikes because
it’s a joy-killer habit, it’s a joy killer habit.

00:05:59.938 --> 00:06:05.263
If you want to enjoy take enjoyment from every person

00:06:05.363 --> 00:06:11.686
like the bee which takes the honey from every flower

00:06:11.786 --> 00:06:15.919
you must develop that sweet personality within yourself

00:06:16.019 --> 00:06:19.590
and then only you will know what is sweet, what is
good

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:23.878
and the enjoyment from one person to another,

00:06:23.978 --> 00:06:30.023
from one collective to another, from one city to another,

00:06:30.123 --> 00:06:36.923
from one country to another will be just beautiful like a swing,

00:06:37.023 --> 00:06:41.681
it will be like a swing going up and down enjoying yourself,

00:06:41.781 --> 00:06:49.593
that’s what is your real divine sensitivity.

00:06:49.693 --> 00:06:54.154
So again today the first thing we have to know that in our heart

00:06:54.254 --> 00:07:07.416
lies the power to absorb, to enjoy the beauty of spirituality.

00:07:07.569 --> 00:07:13.397
There’s a beautiful shloka which I had
told Mahatmaji that he should put it first,

00:07:13.497 --> 00:07:17.820
I was a very small girl but he listened to me

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:21.473
which is a beautiful Pratarnamani, the first thing you have to say

00:07:21.573 --> 00:07:28.620
'Pratarnamani udisanskura-aatm-tatvum,
Sad-chit-sukham paramhansam gatim turyam’.

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:37.010
meaning ‘Early in the morning I pray to that principle of my spirit

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:46.753
Which is the truth, the attention, and joy.

00:07:46.853 --> 00:07:54.931
So that I should go to the highest state of
my ascent.’

00:07:55.572 --> 00:08:00.120
So, opening of the heart is very important for all of us.
