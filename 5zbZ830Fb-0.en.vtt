00:02:31.848 --> 00:02:35.669
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.040
When you seek truth,

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.572
how dynamic one can become,

00:02:50.779 --> 00:02:54.184
you can see the way these artists are,

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.160
how the blessings of the truth helps you

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:04.257
in your self confidence and in the expression of your art.

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:10.280
And also you must have seen how the people from the West,

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.160
who have had no training in Indian music which is very difficult,

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.124
how they have taken easily to it.

00:03:17.386 --> 00:03:22.658
In the same way the Indians have taken to Western music very easily.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.331
The reason is,

00:03:26.522 --> 00:03:30.141
we have to understand what we are.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.451
And that is the truth one has to know.

00:03:34.652 --> 00:03:40.529
The truth is that you are the Spirit.

00:03:41.448 --> 00:03:45.079
You are not this body, this mind,

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.927
this ego, emotions,

00:03:50.128 --> 00:03:53.480
but you are the Spirit.

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.922
Until you become the Self, Spirit,

00:03:57.123 --> 00:04:01.707
you cannot feel the All-Pervading Power,

00:04:01.867 --> 00:04:04.599
which is very subtle.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:09.044
And this is another truth one has to realize,

00:04:09.245 --> 00:04:12.599
that this Power exists

00:04:12.813 --> 00:04:20.737
and it does all the living works,

00:04:21.619 --> 00:04:26.499
it organizes, it thinks,

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.559
above all it loves you.

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.606
But when I say this,

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:39.240
you have to have an open mind of a scientist.

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:46.400
If, what I am saying, like a hypothesis,

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.400
turns out to be true,

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:56.692
then you have to accept it in all your honesty.

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.209
The most important thing today

00:05:08.416 --> 00:05:10.639
is to ask a question to ourselves,

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:15.939
”Why are we here? What is the purpose of our coming?”

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.817
If we ask such a question

00:05:20.018 --> 00:05:25.595
then only a new search towards the truth will start.

00:05:25.796 --> 00:05:28.360
And these two things that I have told you,

00:05:28.561 --> 00:05:31.368
that you are the Spirit

00:05:31.575 --> 00:05:38.019
and that you have to be in connection with this All-Pervading Power,

00:05:38.654 --> 00:05:41.320
will have to work it out for you

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:45.560
because then you become the seekers of truth. It's your right.

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:49.200
So Sahaja means - ‘Saha’ means born with you.

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:52.369
With - ‘Saha’ is with, ‘Ja’ is born.

00:05:52.552 --> 00:05:55.439
So born with you is the right

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:59.800
to be united - that is ‘Yoga’ - with this Divine Power.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.039
This is the real meaning of  ‘Yoga’ -

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:07.097
is that you are to be united with that Divine Power.

00:06:08.238 --> 00:06:13.012
The manifestation of this, when it happens,

00:06:13.213 --> 00:06:18.280
you become a beautiful personality that you are.

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:21.339
You become that glory that you are.

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:24.279
And you rise into a new state

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:29.678
that we call as of ‘collective consciousness’.

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:35.160
This is the process of your evolution.

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:39.160
And this is the last breakthrough of our evolution,

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:43.920
where from human awareness you have to become

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:48.680
a realized soul, a person who is born again.

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:53.960
Like the birds are also called as ’dvijaha’ in Sanskrit language,

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.360
meaning 'those who are born again';

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.887
meaning, first they come as eggs

00:06:59.087 --> 00:07:01.787
and then they are born as birds. In the same way,

00:07:01.994 --> 00:07:03.879
it has to happen to you.

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:06.365
And once these things happen,

00:07:06.556 --> 00:07:12.148
so many manifestations come through

00:07:12.349 --> 00:07:20.053
and we get the beautiful blessings of this All-Pervading Power.

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:22.816
The first thing that happens to you,

00:07:23.014 --> 00:07:25.439
is that physically you feel fit.

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:28.772
You feel fit with your own powers.

00:07:28.973 --> 00:07:31.399
No medicines are needed.

00:07:32.264 --> 00:07:35.217
No maneuvering is needed. Nothing is needed. You just,

00:07:35.418 --> 00:07:39.920
from your own power, which is lying in the triangular bone here.

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:42.880
Have you talked to them something about it? No, it is not. Just...

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:47.720
All right. In the triangular bone this Power lies

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:50.760
which is called as Kundalini.

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:53.720
I think it is too far away for them to see.

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:58.440
Can it be brought, can we bring it forward?

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:01.840
They can’t see it, so what's the use?

00:08:13.248 --> 00:08:16.008
Now all of you can see it?

00:08:17.279 --> 00:08:18.879
SY: This side. This side. Here.

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:22.981
SM: It would be better? All right, this side.

00:08:23.228 --> 00:08:25.633
Can you see now?

00:08:27.561 --> 00:08:30.966
Just this way a little bit. These are all Sahaja Yogis, aren’t they?

00:08:31.167 --> 00:08:34.587
So, it is all right, for you need not see. You just put it this...

00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:37.603
Just little at an angle, please.

00:08:37.804 --> 00:08:41.240
Yes, now is better? All right.

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:45.562
So, this subtle system exists within us.

00:08:45.763 --> 00:08:48.520
And we have to understand this subtle system.

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:52.400
Like all our civilizations has grown outward, like a tree.

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:57.280
And whatever we have knowledge through science or any other method,

00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:59.436
is the knowledge of the tree.

00:08:59.643 --> 00:09:02.039
But we have no knowledge of our roots.

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:07.720
And that is why we are always under a threat of a shock

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:10.414
and God knows what's going to happen to us.

00:09:10.615 --> 00:09:12.890
If we know our roots,

00:09:13.091 --> 00:09:16.720
then we know how to nourish this tree very well.

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:21.320
Now here you see in the triangular bone, is this Power,

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:23.923
what we call as Kundalini in a Sanskrit word,

00:09:24.124 --> 00:09:26.138
but ‘Kundal’ means coils,

00:09:26.321 --> 00:09:28.996
coiled up into three and a half coils.

00:09:29.197 --> 00:09:33.520
And this Power is the residual power within us

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:38.400
which is waiting for that moment when it can be awakened.

00:09:38.601 --> 00:09:43.240
And like you have now connected by this cord to the mains,

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:47.400
this Power rises and connects you to the mains.

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:50.760
By that you become a subtler personality,

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:53.920
you become that collective conscious personality,

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:56.000
you go beyond thoughts.

00:09:56.176 --> 00:10:00.429
And as I told you, physically, mentally and emotionally

00:10:00.651 --> 00:10:04.984
you become absolutely a perfect personality.

00:10:05.185 --> 00:10:09.360
Apart from that, you achieve your peace of mind,

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:11.977
all your tensions disappear

00:10:12.178 --> 00:10:15.799
and that you become a witness.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.120
Like a witness you see the play, the play of the Divine,

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:27.120
and the complete knowledge of the Divine and the subtle knowledge,

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:31.000
becomes your own; which is an absolute knowledge.

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:35.920
Everybody who is in Sahaja Yoga knows the same thing.

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:39.829
There is no argument, there is no fight,

00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:42.319
there is no discussion.

00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:45.240
Because once you get this Realization,

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:48.207
when this Kundalini rises and passes through

00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:50.815
six subtle centers above,

00:10:51.016 --> 00:10:54.994
then you start feeling on your finger tips,

00:10:55.195 --> 00:10:58.024
the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost, as they call it,

00:10:58.225 --> 00:11:01.615
or we can say the All Pervading Power.

00:11:01.869 --> 00:11:06.800
Also you can feel the cool breeze, out of your fontanel bone area

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.280
when this Kundalini pierces through,

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:14.840
and that is the actualization of baptism.

00:11:15.041 --> 00:11:16.457
Is not artificial

00:11:16.658 --> 00:11:19.569
that somebody puts the finger on your thing and say,

00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:21.176
"Now you are baptized."

00:11:21.377 --> 00:11:25.588
Baptism is a living process

00:11:25.789 --> 00:11:29.483
and it's a living process of evolution

00:11:29.658 --> 00:11:36.287
that gives you this new dimension to your awareness.

00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:42.040
Now the rising of the Kundalini is spontaneous

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:45.840
because it's a living process. Like if you have a seed,

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:51.240
it sprouts if you put it in the Mother Earth, spontaneously.

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:53.507
We don’t have to stand [on] our heads

00:11:53.706 --> 00:11:56.830
or to read some sort of a book or a scripture.

00:11:57.031 --> 00:11:58.480
It just happens.

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:01.395
In the same way, spontaneously,

00:12:01.596 --> 00:12:05.920
this power rises and connects you to the mains.

00:12:06.121 --> 00:12:08.720
As a result, as I told, you become dynamic,

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:12.315
you become extremely creative,

00:12:12.516 --> 00:12:17.692
you feel very young, you work very hard, you don’t feel tired

00:12:17.893 --> 00:12:22.314
and so many diseases automatically get cured by your own power,

00:12:22.515 --> 00:12:23.816
by yourself.

00:12:24.017 --> 00:12:28.840
Nobody has to cure you. You just get absolutely cured out of it.

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:35.171
For example, we have so many problems in the modern times,

00:12:35.372 --> 00:12:38.400
of very different nature:

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:40.823
that people are overactive

00:12:41.006 --> 00:12:44.538
and over activity takes them away from reality

00:12:44.739 --> 00:12:48.561
and they become sort of slaves of over activity.

00:12:48.762 --> 00:12:54.219
This is done by the second center which is, you see, the yellow, the bile.

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:56.720
This center is, for example,

00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:59.200
I will tell you about one center at least today,

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:03.000
That this center is called as Swadisthana center

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:07.320
and which looks after, on the physical side,

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:11.080
and caters for aortic plexus.

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:14.539
And this center has got a very important work to be done,

00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:20.955
is to convert the fat for the replacement

00:13:21.156 --> 00:13:24.387
of the grey cells of our brain.

00:13:24.588 --> 00:13:28.440
This is a very important work for people who are futuristic,

00:13:28.641 --> 00:13:31.760
who are planning all the time, who are thinking too much.

00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:36.920
As a result all other functions of this center are neglected.

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:41.880
And these other functions are, that it has to cater to your liver.

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:44.270
Now liver has a job,

00:13:44.438 --> 00:13:50.054
it has to transform the heat or the poison from your body,

00:13:50.255 --> 00:13:53.189
as heat into the blood stream

00:13:53.390 --> 00:13:56.480
so that it is thrown out.

00:13:56.680 --> 00:14:00.387
But when this center is busy

00:14:00.562 --> 00:14:03.279
doing something else, so important,

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:08.440
this work is left undone or sometimes very much neglected.

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:13.200
As a result one develops a bad system of liver.

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:15.755
This liver creates heat,

00:14:15.939 --> 00:14:18.679
does not throw out the heat from the body

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:23.433
which passes along and you get so many complications with it,

00:14:23.634 --> 00:14:27.063
like asthma and others.

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:32.119
Today we had a patient who came and she had the same problem.

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:36.011
And she said, "They have told me I have some viruses, this, that",

00:14:36.212 --> 00:14:38.360
all kinds of diagnosis she told Me.

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:40.960
I said, "Nothing, you just have liver,

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:44.756
and you just try to improve your liver, you will be all right".

00:14:44.957 --> 00:14:47.303
Within ten minutes she said, "I'm feeling all right".

00:14:47.494 --> 00:14:49.279
I said, "That's it.

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:52.120
You have a liver problem. So this virus is there,

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:56.000
that virus is there, all kinds of roundabout ways of saying

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:59.920
to show that it is absolutely incurable".

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:03.793
Now, then you go from there

00:15:03.994 --> 00:15:08.000
to another very important work, is that of the pancreas

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:14.560
which looks after or caters of dissolving your sugar.

00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:19.120
But when you have this pancreas in a mess,

00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:23.840
because this center is not looking after it,

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:27.440
then you develop a horrible disease called diabetes.

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:29.800
And this diabetes only happens to people

00:15:30.001 --> 00:15:33.137
who sit down and think too much, who plan too much,

00:15:33.338 --> 00:15:35.800
mostly to bureaucrats,

00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:40.000
and maybe to politicians, I don’t know.

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:44.440
But say in India, farmers ask for sugar

00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:49.560
and if you give them tea, the sugar should be so much

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:53.240
that the spoon should stand at right angles, you see.

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:57.600
Otherwise they'll think, "This is no tea, this is horrible!"

00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:02.318
And despite all that, they never get diabetes.

00:16:02.519 --> 00:16:06.280
But any bureaucrat who is too much of a planner

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:10.264
or a politician or someone like that, who thinks too much,

00:16:11.597 --> 00:16:13.316
gets it even with one spoon,

00:16:13.517 --> 00:16:15.959
maybe with the half spoon he gets diabetes.

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:20.415
So this is due to the fact that this poor center

00:16:20.616 --> 00:16:23.960
has to do some work for all these people

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:27.080
who are extra active with their brains

00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:33.600
and other organs like pancreas, are neglected.

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:38.240
Then third one is even more important, more dangerous is the spleen.

00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:41.360
The spleen is the one, which is, we can say,

00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:43.840
is the one which keeps the rhythm of life.

00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:47.840
As you have seen the rhythmic work, it keeps the rhythm of life.

00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:52.146
Now this rhythmic work,

00:16:52.347 --> 00:16:55.109
if we do not allow it to work with proper rhythm

00:16:55.316 --> 00:16:57.199
and we have become hectic,

00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:02.240
then this center has the job to create

00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:08.480
red blood corpuscles for the use of any emergencies.

00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:13.479
Supposing you have taken your food and suddenly you want to run,

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:15.397
then you get a pain here

00:17:15.598 --> 00:17:17.659
and you don’t know why you are getting the pain.

00:17:17.860 --> 00:17:22.294
Because that time your spleen goes into action in a very frantic way

00:17:22.495 --> 00:17:26.131
and produces more RBCs, red blood corpuscles

00:17:26.332 --> 00:17:30.668
and with that, it has to work hard, you get that pain.

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:36.705
Now when you lead such a hectic life, all the time under shocks,

00:17:36.906 --> 00:17:39.453
like early in the morning we read the newspapers;

00:17:39.604 --> 00:17:41.479
one shock is sufficient.

00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:45.318
Then secondly you have to have your breakfast,

00:17:45.519 --> 00:17:49.054
you can’t have time, you are in a busy, you are running away to work

00:17:49.255 --> 00:17:51.194
and on the way you find there is a jam.

00:17:51.395 --> 00:17:55.440
Then you go, your boss also shouting at you for getting late,

00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:58.280
all kinds of time bound things, you see.

00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:02.503
All these plays upon your spleen,

00:18:02.704 --> 00:18:04.614
and poor spleen doesn’t understand

00:18:04.815 --> 00:18:07.627
what sort of a personality is this one; is so hectic.

00:18:07.828 --> 00:18:11.499
God knows, it requires red blood corpuscles now and then

00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:14.920
and like that, is so hectic, there is no rhythm about it...

00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:18.440
so it gets, you should say, crazy.

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:22.717
Then it becomes vulnerable, absolutely vulnerable

00:18:22.918 --> 00:18:26.178
for a disease called blood cancer.

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:29.506
Then at the same time,

00:18:29.707 --> 00:18:33.840
if on the left side there is some triggering done, triggering

00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:37.000
due to some shock or some sort of pain or unhappiness

00:18:37.201 --> 00:18:39.078
or something like that,

00:18:39.285 --> 00:18:41.079
this disease sets in.

00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:45.180
Now people who have come to Sahaja Yoga, were certified

00:18:45.381 --> 00:18:48.360
to be dead within eight days also by doctors,

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:50.360
who have suffered from this trouble,

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:53.280
got themselves cured of blood cancer.

00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:55.877
Cancer is also cured with it, no doubt.

00:18:56.078 --> 00:18:59.376
But it is cured automatically by your own powers.

00:18:59.577 --> 00:19:03.320
Nobody has to cure you. You just get cured by your own powers.

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:05.352
Once you get your Realization,

00:19:05.553 --> 00:19:07.862
and you know how to handle your own powers,

00:19:08.061 --> 00:19:09.422
how to treat yourself,

00:19:09.623 --> 00:19:12.400
first you can find out what is wrong with your centers,

00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:14.121
diagnosis is there,

00:19:14.296 --> 00:19:17.079
and you can find out also how to get it cured.

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:18.741
You can cure yourself

00:19:18.942 --> 00:19:22.008
and you can help others to get their Realization.

00:19:22.209 --> 00:19:23.720
This is the power you get.

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:26.599
It is not just a certificate, a false certificate,

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:31.085
that, "I am a self-realized person, I am a twice-born person."

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:43.160
It has to be a certificate from yourself

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:45.400
that you have to feel the cool breeze.

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:49.120
You have to feel that All Pervading Power.

00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:54.280
You have to feel your peace and your silence within yourself.

00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:56.840
So first of all when the Kundalini rises,

00:19:57.040 --> 00:19:59.686
She passes through this center

00:19:59.887 --> 00:20:01.679
which we call as Agnya,

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:06.160
which is placed in the optic chasma.

00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:09.720
When this passes through that it sucks in from both the sides,

00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:12.280
these two institutions which are created

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:15.680
by our left and right sympathetic nervous system.

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:20.120
Whenever there is an emergency, the sympathetic goes into action.

00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:23.760
So here we have an autonomous nervous system.

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:27.120
Autonomous nervous system is named by doctors.

00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:29.320
We have to ask them, "What do you mean by auto?

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:31.640
Who is this 'auto'? Who does this job?"

00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:35.360
So we have left and right side of autonomous nervous system

00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:38.640
nourished by these two channels, left and right.

00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:42.080
And when this autonomous nervous system starts working

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:44.949
either on the desire side

00:20:45.150 --> 00:20:47.678
or we can say emotional side, on the left hand side,

00:20:47.879 --> 00:20:51.959
it creates an institution here, which we call as superego,

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:54.280
or in Sanskrit called as ‘Mana’,

00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:57.240
where all our conditionings are stored up.

00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:03.307
And on the other side, if the right side is too much excited,

00:21:03.508 --> 00:21:06.040
if a person is too much futuristic

00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:09.800
and is using too much his mental and physical capacities,

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.725
then there is another institution

00:21:11.916 --> 00:21:13.895
that is created on top of your head,

00:21:14.096 --> 00:21:17.077
which we call as ‘ego’.

00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:21.040
These two meet and sometimes overlap

00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:24.440
and so we close our fontanel bone area

00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:27.925
which was a soft bone in your childhood.

00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:32.240
So when this Kundalini passes through this center

00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:34.474
which we call as Agnya Chakra,

00:21:34.675 --> 00:21:38.487
it sucks in these two institutions. So your karmas are sucked in

00:21:38.688 --> 00:21:41.600
and your conditionings are sucked in

00:21:41.801 --> 00:21:45.921
and it comes down like this, it opens this area,

00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:48.640
Kundalini pierces through this.

00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:51.520
Now this is a spontaneous thing happening.

00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:54.600
It is not that you have to do something about it.

00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:58.089
As the car starts, all the machinery starts working,

00:21:58.290 --> 00:22:00.787
this also starts working.

00:22:00.988 --> 00:22:03.680
But, in... say, "This is modern Raja yoga is there,

00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:07.320
Hatha yoga is there", everybody ask Me question after the lecture,

00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:10.000
so it is better I tell you about it already,

00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:12.948
that this so called Raja yoga is something

00:22:13.115 --> 00:22:17.343
like when the car has not yet started,

00:22:17.544 --> 00:22:19.400
the machinery won’t start.

00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:22.080
So without starting the car you start moving the wheels

00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:24.400
is the modern's Raja yoga.

00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:27.000
They even cut the tongues of, I mean

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:30.760
not the tongues but the threads of the tongues of people,

00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:32.847
to push back the tongue,

00:22:33.085 --> 00:22:36.519
so that it can stop the Kundalini.

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:41.400
But when the Kundalini is rising by itself, it stops.

00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:46.680
It stops every area it crosses through.

00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:50.800
Supposing it comes to this area, then when it passes through it,

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:55.520
it has to go into an augmentation, into constriction

00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:58.320
to stop that Kundalini falling down.

00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:00.605
So it is done automatically.

00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:04.743
As we eat our food it gets digested, in the same way it happens.

00:23:04.944 --> 00:23:07.880
But artificially it is not to be done.

00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:11.520
And all these artificial doing is of no help.

00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:15.880
Same about Hatha yoga. Is ‘ha´-`tha’, is two words there,

00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:18.480
meaning the sun line and the moon line,

00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:21.800
meaning the left and the right side channel, both are to be used.

00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:24.800
But when we do Hatha yoga in the modern times,

00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:28.120
we are just trying to do only physical exercises

00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:31.607
which is a very wee, wee part of the Patanjali yoga,

00:23:31.808 --> 00:23:34.640
out of which Hatha yoga has come.

00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:37.440
In the Patanjali yoga is described that

00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:41.712
you have to see a person who has got problems on his physical side.

00:23:41.913 --> 00:23:45.216
Supposing now somebody has had an accident or something

00:23:45.417 --> 00:23:49.525
and the back bone is not all right and there is a problem on that.

00:23:49.726 --> 00:23:51.640
So you have to correct it.

00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:55.028
But this correction is the best once the Kundalini is up,

00:23:55.229 --> 00:23:56.880
so you know where is the problem

00:23:57.081 --> 00:23:59.320
and then is to be corrected scientifically.

00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:01.599
Not to be done in a haphazard manner.

00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:04.720
And sometimes the people do Hatha yoga in the way,

00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:09.120
that as if they are taking all the medicine boxes together,

00:24:09.321 --> 00:24:10.889
without any discrimination.

00:24:11.090 --> 00:24:13.205
So you should have discrimination about it

00:24:13.396 --> 00:24:15.559
and you should find out what’s wrong

00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:19.840
and then do exactly whatever is needed to be done.

00:24:20.041 --> 00:24:22.003
Not to do everything blindly.

00:24:22.204 --> 00:24:25.159
So the first thing, the blessings of Sahaja Yoga is

00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:27.600
that you get to know all the knowledge.

00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:29.680
It is not just you say this mantra,

00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:31.960
you do this thing, you do, nothing of that kind.

00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:35.480
You first become the Spirit.

00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:38.600
And you know everything about it, what it is.

00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:43.095
You experience it, you find out for yourself, you certify yourself

00:24:43.296 --> 00:24:46.640
and then you have to work it out.

00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:50.120
So it is a very practical, pragmatic thing.

00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:52.431
Of course you can’t pay for all these things.

00:24:52.632 --> 00:24:55.154
Those who are paying for this must know is a wrong thing,

00:24:55.304 --> 00:24:57.071
because it's a living process.

00:24:57.272 --> 00:25:00.120
For a living process how can you pay?

00:25:00.321 --> 00:25:02.738
It's something absurd but people don’t understand

00:25:02.892 --> 00:25:05.299
that you cannot pay for it

00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:07.093
because they don’t feel confident

00:25:07.294 --> 00:25:09.015
if you don’t have to pay for something.

00:25:09.216 --> 00:25:12.074
The other day I was in Cairns,

00:25:12.275 --> 00:25:14.444
and there is a Sahaja Yogini and she said, "Mother,

00:25:14.645 --> 00:25:18.544
they wouldn’t come to a program for which you don’t have to pay."

00:25:18.745 --> 00:25:20.760
"So then, what did you do?"

00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:23.920
She said, "I told them I will take 50 dollars from you."

00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:28.080
They all came with 50 dollars, quite happy and satisfied.

00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:30.208
So she took 50 dollars from them,

00:25:30.409 --> 00:25:33.046
gave them Realization, worked it out

00:25:33.247 --> 00:25:35.334
and then she returned the money saying,

00:25:35.535 --> 00:25:38.319
"I don’t need this money, sorry."

00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:41.320
But this kind of a psychology, I can’t understand

00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:44.961
that we are so much used to payment in everything

00:25:45.162 --> 00:25:48.000
that we cannot understand one thing, that

00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:50.717
Divine doesn’t know what is payment is.

00:25:50.918 --> 00:25:54.000
How much do we pay for this Mother Earth for sprouting everything,

00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:56.280
for giving us beautiful trees and things?

00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:59.640
How much did we do for Her that we have to pay for it?

00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:02.600
But this is something we don’t understand in the West.

00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:04.932
In India they do because they know

00:26:05.133 --> 00:26:08.501
that Divine has no sense of money.

00:26:08.702 --> 00:26:11.327
It doesn’t know banking, doesn’t know insurance,

00:26:11.528 --> 00:26:12.884
nothing of the kind.

00:26:13.085 --> 00:26:15.560
And this is what we have to understand first of all

00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:19.600
that if we have to become a divine personality,

00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:23.520
we must respect it as a pure thing.

00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:27.080
It doesn’t need any money, it doesn’t need anything.

00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:31.480
It just needs one thing which is the pure desire within you,

00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:34.480
because this is the power of pure desire,

00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:38.920
the desire that, "I have to become one with the Divine."

00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:41.285
All other desires are impure,

00:26:41.486 --> 00:26:45.960
because no desire when fulfilled, gives you satisfaction.

00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:49.400
You jump from one desire to another desire.

00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:53.480
That’s why it is said in economics that in general

00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:57.120
the desires and wants are not satiable.

00:26:57.320 --> 00:26:59.640
But this is the desire that we have.

00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:02.147
And once this desire is fulfilled,

00:27:02.348 --> 00:27:06.863
we become absolutely contented, satisfied

00:27:07.064 --> 00:27:11.000
and a complete balance is established within ourselves.

00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:14.360
All these ecological problems settle down

00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:18.792
because the imbalance in the human beings itself

00:27:18.993 --> 00:27:21.440
creates the imbalance outside.

00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:25.560
Whatever are human problems are projected outside.

00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:27.675
These are not problems

00:27:27.876 --> 00:27:30.760
which have come from nature, but are created by us.

00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:35.240
Because of our problems these problems arise.

00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:39.640
So somehow if we can manage to put ourself in proper line,

00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:45.999
everything will be fine and we will live in a new era of,

00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:48.316
what we call the Golden Age,

00:27:48.515 --> 00:27:51.239
and we enter into the Kingdom of God.

00:27:51.439 --> 00:27:54.039
Because then you will realize, yourself experience

00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:56.520
that every moment is so surprising,

00:27:56.720 --> 00:28:01.520
how it works out, how things just help you

00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:07.200
and how you manage to get over difficulties without any trouble!

00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:10.040
It is something so wonderful, so fantastic!

00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:13.000
And is sometimes people will be skeptical about it.

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:15.040
They will think how can that be?

00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:17.596
But supposing there is a television set

00:28:17.797 --> 00:28:21.520
I take it to the ignorant people in our Indian villages

00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:23.068
and show them and say that

00:28:23.269 --> 00:28:25.139
"You can see all kinds of films in this one",

00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:27.731
They will say, "What, this box! How can it show?"

00:28:27.932 --> 00:28:29.833
So we treat ourselves as that box.

00:28:30.034 --> 00:28:31.804
But actually when you put it to the mains,

00:28:31.970 --> 00:28:33.839
you know how fantastic it is.

00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:36.640
So, we are not created just for nothing.

00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:38.541
We are created for a special work,

00:28:38.742 --> 00:28:41.100
only thing is we have to know our Self.

00:28:41.301 --> 00:28:45.480
And all the scriptures and religions have said ‘know thy self’.

00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:50.091
But all of them have gone astray, absolutely astray,

00:28:50.292 --> 00:28:53.280
they have become all man-made sort of things.

00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:58.946
And that is why people are in complete disillusionment about them.

00:28:59.147 --> 00:29:02.080
But whosoever created them,

00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:05.320
all those great prophets, incarnations

00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:10.209
are absolutely truthful people and they told the truth.

00:29:10.410 --> 00:29:13.002
All the saints were truthful people.

00:29:13.203 --> 00:29:14.965
And we have to learn from them

00:29:15.166 --> 00:29:17.560
and we ourselves have to become saints.

00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:19.503
We don’t have to give up our families,

00:29:19.704 --> 00:29:22.572
we don’t have to do all this nonsensical things which are outside.

00:29:22.773 --> 00:29:24.920
The detachment works out within yourself.

00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:27.240
Everything works out within yourself

00:29:27.441 --> 00:29:29.740
and I am sure today, in Brisbane,

00:29:29.931 --> 00:29:32.039
we'll be achieving it for all of you.

00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:37.360
Because modern Sahaja Yoga is an en masse happening.

00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:40.669
Formerly, only one or two people used to get Realization;

00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:44.400
on the tree of life there were only one or two flowers.

00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:46.429
But today I call it a blossom time.

00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:50.023
And also this is the Day of Judgment,

00:29:50.191 --> 00:29:51.839
where we judge ourselves.

00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:54.920
In the Koran it is said that your hands would speak

00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:57.040
and you will judge yourself.

00:29:57.241 --> 00:30:00.463
But even the Muslims are not following what He said,

00:30:00.664 --> 00:30:03.404
even the Christians are not following what Christ has said,

00:30:03.605 --> 00:30:06.788
even the Hindus are not following what their Scriptures have said.

00:30:06.989 --> 00:30:09.098
They are all having a nice

00:30:09.299 --> 00:30:13.720
money-oriented or power-oriented organization.

00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:15.546
That is not going to help us.

00:30:15.745 --> 00:30:18.599
We have to have the Reality, the Truth.

00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:21.285
It is for our benevolence,

00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:23.519
for the benevolence of our children,

00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:25.880
for the benevolence of the whole world.

00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:29.080
That is how the whole humanity has to emancipate.

00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:32.680
And that's what I am here to tell you about.

00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:35.360
May God bless you all!

00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:43.355
We are rather time bound because they told Me

00:30:43.556 --> 00:30:46.960
that your conveyance is a problem here

00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:51.040
and that I should finish everything before 9.30.

00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:56.160
So I have to tell you one thing that if you could

00:30:56.361 --> 00:30:59.076
ask Me some questions that you have, relevant questions,

00:30:59.277 --> 00:31:01.592
because I am not here to take anything from you.

00:31:01.793 --> 00:31:03.920
I am here just to tell you what you are

00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:06.480
and to see that you get what you have.

00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:08.790
So if you have any relevant questions,

00:31:08.981 --> 00:31:12.390
please ask Me for a few minutes.

00:31:12.591 --> 00:31:15.606
And then we will have the session for Realization

00:31:15.807 --> 00:31:17.566
that will take about ten minutes.

00:31:17.767 --> 00:31:21.840
So I'll be very happy if you could ask Me questions about it.

00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:25.377
One thing I have to say and excuse Myself

00:31:25.578 --> 00:31:28.785
that in a one-day lecture,

00:31:28.986 --> 00:31:30.895
I cannot cover the whole subject.

00:31:31.096 --> 00:31:33.559
It is an ocean of knowledge.

00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:36.760
And this ocean of knowledge can be understood better

00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:38.688
when you have Self Realization,

00:31:38.832 --> 00:31:41.876
the light of your Spirit in your attention.

00:31:42.077 --> 00:31:44.920
You will understand it much better.

00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:48.080
But there are My lectures, so many, thousands of them

00:31:48.262 --> 00:31:49.871
in English language itself.

00:31:50.072 --> 00:31:52.000
So you can listen to them also.

00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:56.080
But first, the best thing is to get your Realization.

00:31:56.280 --> 00:31:58.520
For example there are so many lights here

00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:00.186
and when you come in

00:32:00.361 --> 00:32:03.743
what you do is to just switch on and the whole thing comes up.

00:32:03.944 --> 00:32:07.680
But supposing I have tell you everything about the electricity,

00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:11.000
the discovery of electricity, then how it was brought here,

00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:14.160
and in Brisbane how it was arranged, it will be a headache.

00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:15.929
So best is to get the lights

00:32:16.130 --> 00:32:19.920
and then we'lll know more about the knowledge of it.

00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:21.960
May God bless you!

00:32:30.878 --> 00:32:34.280
M: I would like to know how to perform meditation.

00:32:36.807 --> 00:32:39.221
SY: He'd like to know how to perform meditation.

00:32:39.422 --> 00:32:42.039
SM: It's good question. That is what I am going to do now.

00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:44.530
You do not do meditation

00:32:44.737 --> 00:32:47.519
but you are in meditation.

00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:51.000
It is a state. It is a state in which you rise,

00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:53.960
where you become thoughtlessly aware to begin with.

00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:56.440
You are aware but there is no thought.

00:32:56.640 --> 00:32:58.760
And whenever you want to think, you will think,

00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:01.400
otherwise you can stop your thoughts. That is first state.

00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:05.440
And the second one is called as doubtless awareness

00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:07.960
where you have no doubts left about it

00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:10.626
and you just become so powerful

00:33:10.827 --> 00:33:12.954
that you can give Realizations to others,

00:33:13.155 --> 00:33:17.120
you can do so many things, which normally you could have never done.

00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:19.760
These two states are to be achieved.

00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:22.680
So we don’t have to do meditation as such,

00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:27.320
it just will work out. You will be in meditation.

00:33:28.855 --> 00:33:32.080
L: Can you put it [louder]? I am not hearing You...

00:33:32.281 --> 00:33:34.707
SY: Not hearing very well?
L: No, I am not.

00:33:34.908 --> 00:33:38.157
SY: Do you hear [unclear]?

00:33:39.472 --> 00:33:41.765
SM: What is it?

00:33:42.839 --> 00:33:44.055
What is it?

00:33:44.278 --> 00:33:48.279
SY: The speakers, there is a noise in the speakers and I want to see...

00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:53.040
SM: There is a noise on? Some sort of a noise ...

00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:57.520
Next time we will have better arrangements for you.

00:33:58.090 --> 00:34:00.111
But whatever may be the problem,

00:34:00.302 --> 00:34:03.873
you will get your Realizations all right.

00:34:10.487 --> 00:34:13.040
What is it?

00:34:13.910 --> 00:34:16.479
SY: She wants me to give you another mike or something.

00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:18.400
Is not good?

00:34:27.740 --> 00:34:32.826
SY: She wants to know, does reincarnation affect individual spirits?

00:34:33.362 --> 00:34:35.864
SM: Individual spirits?

00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:40.765
I didn't...
SY: That is the question. Could you...?

00:34:40.966 --> 00:34:43.372
L: You know, about rebirth, do we all reincarnate?

00:34:43.571 --> 00:34:45.399
Do we all have another life?

00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:47.120
SY: Do we all reincarnate?

00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:50.152
SM: Of course. No doubt.

00:34:50.851 --> 00:34:54.159
You see you must logically understand.

00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:59.280
Now supposing you were in a certain century

00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:03.480
and you had committed some mistakes, supposing,

00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:06.347
or you have done something good,

00:35:06.530 --> 00:35:09.679
or you were searching something,

00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:12.323
you were wanting something.

00:35:12.514 --> 00:35:14.639
Then, I mean,

00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:19.480
you are not going to be condemned by one life, isn’t it?

00:35:19.719 --> 00:35:24.959
Because God Almighty is the ocean of forgiveness

00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:26.529
and He loves you

00:35:26.730 --> 00:35:29.399
and He wants you to enter into the Kingdom of God.

00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:32.027
So He gives you more chances.

00:35:32.210 --> 00:35:36.369
I will tell you one thing that we had a driver

00:35:36.570 --> 00:35:40.214
and he was a very quiet and very stately personality.

00:35:41.554 --> 00:35:48.631
And he told Me that he has become a driver

00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:52.880
because in last life he must have been some king

00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:56.960
and the king must have been over burdened with work.

00:35:57.160 --> 00:36:00.760
So the king must have thought is better to be a driver

00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:03.231
and there is no burdening of this,

00:36:03.432 --> 00:36:07.600
"So, I have become a driver and very happy about it".

00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:10.080
In the same way, you see, things can happen

00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:12.120
that you are searching for something.

00:36:12.321 --> 00:36:14.321
Like somebody wants to marry some lady.

00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:16.403
I mean is just mad

00:36:16.579 --> 00:36:19.075
and he suffers from Greek tragedy you can call it,

00:36:19.276 --> 00:36:21.720
and goes into a kind of a nonsensical ideas,

00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:26.766
doesn’t love his wife and just thinks of another woman all the time,

00:36:26.967 --> 00:36:29.400
and thinks that, "I should get married to her".

00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:33.640
So the next life, the Divine says, "All right, have her!"

00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:38.008
And then he says, "Oh, God! What a wife! Better run away."

00:36:38.209 --> 00:36:39.676
So he learns a lesson.

00:36:39.877 --> 00:36:43.279
So it is like giving lessons in your different lives.

00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:45.205
Is very important

00:36:45.406 --> 00:36:48.061
because God is not going to just damn you like that,

00:36:48.220 --> 00:36:51.559
that you are good for nothing, is not going to stamp you like that.

00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:53.208
Is a wrong idea.

00:36:53.391 --> 00:36:56.142
And because Christ also has said, "I will come again".

00:36:56.343 --> 00:37:01.152
If He had not believed in reincarnation why did He say that?

00:37:01.946 --> 00:37:04.320
Very irrelevant.

00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:17.880
It has, you see in the, between the lines you must be able to read.

00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:21.775
And that is the problem is that, between the lines we cannot read

00:37:21.976 --> 00:37:23.681
because we are not realized souls.

00:37:23.882 --> 00:37:26.004
Once we are realized souls

00:37:26.155 --> 00:37:28.755
we start seeing everything between the lines.

00:37:28.956 --> 00:37:30.640
Otherwise we cannot understand.

00:37:30.841 --> 00:37:33.221
And the whole thing becomes superficial

00:37:33.421 --> 00:37:36.934
and people who are interested only in money building and all that

00:37:37.135 --> 00:37:39.080
start some sort of a wrong idea

00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:43.333
and we get absolutely deluded by them.

00:37:55.480 --> 00:38:01.314
M: What is the place of Christ in them? What is [the relation]?

00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:03.324
SM: What is the...?

00:38:03.525 --> 00:38:07.080
SY: He said where is Christ in this set up and what is the relation?

00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:11.879
SM: On the Agnya, on the Agnya chakra.
M: But what is the relation?

00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:14.720
SM: You see because He is on the optic chiasma

00:38:14.919 --> 00:38:17.889
which we, sometimes people call it "a third eye".

00:38:18.090 --> 00:38:19.627
He is on the Agnya chakra.

00:38:19.828 --> 00:38:23.617
Now what I am saying is - you can verify it on your vibrations -

00:38:23.818 --> 00:38:25.589
because when the Kundalini rises

00:38:25.772 --> 00:38:27.898
and She comes up to the Agnya chakra,

00:38:28.099 --> 00:38:30.400
you have to say Lord’s prayer.

00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:35.144
And that’s how He has died for our sins.

00:38:35.345 --> 00:38:38.840
He has died for our sins means, He, once He is awakened,

00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:43.640
that all our conditionings and all our ego is sucked in.

00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:48.400
He is a very, very important gate through which we have to pass.

00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:49.998
He said “I am the gate”.

00:38:50.199 --> 00:38:53.476
He didn’t say, "I am the destination", but "I am the gate".

00:38:53.677 --> 00:38:54.999
Very clear.

00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:56.834
Christ's life you cannot understand

00:38:57.035 --> 00:38:59.578
unless and until you have your Realization. Not at all.

00:38:59.779 --> 00:39:02.880
Through these priests and all that, you cannot understand it at all.

00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:07.280
Specially, Mr. Paul, I don’t know how he appeared in the scene,

00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:09.652
because he himself was epileptic

00:39:09.853 --> 00:39:12.994
and some sort of an experience he had,

00:39:13.195 --> 00:39:16.242
and this spoiling Christianity has
been criticized by so many people.

00:39:16.443 --> 00:39:21.500
Recently I read a book written by a very good German priest

00:39:21.701 --> 00:39:23.399
when Christ was in India,

00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:27.600
and he has absolutely condemned Paul in Christianity;

00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:30.280
he said he has brought all kinds of things

00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:33.106
which are not relevant to Christ.

00:39:33.297 --> 00:39:37.360
Then also there was a book written by Thomas

00:39:37.561 --> 00:39:39.520
who was travelling to India

00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:42.012
and on his way he stopped in Egypt

00:39:42.213 --> 00:39:44.504
where he wrote lot of treatises

00:39:44.705 --> 00:39:47.987
and also wrote about what Christ had said it

00:39:48.162 --> 00:39:50.439
and was kept in a big jar.

00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:54.560
And he called all these people who followed Christ, as ‘gnostics’.

00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:56.609
Gnostics - those who know, ‘Gna’.

00:39:56.810 --> 00:39:58.857
‘Gna’ word comes from the word ‘jnana’.

00:39:59.058 --> 00:40:01.840
‘Jnana’ means to know on your central nervous system.

00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:06.000
Is also in Buddhist thing, is called as ‘ Boddha’.

00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:09.520
‘Buddh’, ‘ Boddha’ is to know on your central nervous system.

00:40:09.720 --> 00:40:15.640
And also, say in the Hindu scriptures is called as ‘vida’

00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:17.751
means from where the word ‘Veda’ comes,

00:40:17.952 --> 00:40:20.800
that you have to know on your central nervous system.

00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:25.040
Now, this book has been now after 48 years,

00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:27.720
it has been now decoded and found out and

00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:30.320
there was a very nice program on this.

00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:35.280
And it was all challenging, all these ideas of Paul in Christianity.

00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:38.840
You don’t have to suffer. He said, "Why should you suffer?",

00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:42.600
because God Almighty is the Father of all the fathers,

00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:44.880
and why should we ask you to suffer?

00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:46.860
Christ has already suffered for you.

00:40:47.061 --> 00:40:48.799
Now, you are not going to suffer more.

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:51.920
So many things like that and also about Sahaja Yoga,

00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:55.720
that it’s a spontaneous experience which must be experienced

00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:59.440
and must be felt on the central nervous system.

00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:03.280
He said so clearly, on your nerves, as he said it.

00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:06.577
So, this book has been written down

00:41:06.778 --> 00:41:08.455
and is known as "The Gnostics".

00:41:08.656 --> 00:41:10.840
If you can get hold of it, please go through it.

00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:13.898
It’s a wonderful book which will give you full idea

00:41:14.050 --> 00:41:15.935
as to what Thomas wrote about.

00:41:16.136 --> 00:41:18.400
And these people were called as ‘Gnostics’.

00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:20.358
They were not called as Christians,

00:41:20.559 --> 00:41:22.920
but ‘Gnostics’ means the ones who have known.

00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:25.448
Known what? Known, not through your brains,

00:41:25.649 --> 00:41:27.959
but known on your central nervous system.

00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:32.171
As in Sanskrit language is called as ’Gynanis’.

00:41:38.057 --> 00:41:41.713
M: Could You tell us a bit more about the rising of the Kundalini,

00:41:41.914 --> 00:41:45.309
when this Kundalini rise, can we make Kundalini rise?

00:41:45.510 --> 00:41:48.543
Is it dangerous [unclear]?

00:41:49.586 --> 00:41:54.039
SY: Could You tell us some more about Kundalini. Is it dangerous to rise?

00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:57.400
SM: No, not at all. This [part], I should have covered Myself.

00:41:57.600 --> 00:42:00.600
Not at all, is never dangerous, you see.

00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:04.360
It’s your Mother. She is your individual Mother.

00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:08.560
When you were born your mother took all the labor pains upon herself.

00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:10.593
She didn’t give you any pain.

00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:13.399
In the same way She is your Mother

00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:16.530
and that’s a Mother energy, that is the primordial Mother

00:42:16.731 --> 00:42:18.239
which is reflected in you.

00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:20.880
That’s the Holy Ghost. They didn’t talk of Mother

00:42:21.081 --> 00:42:22.599
but they said it is a dove.

00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:24.327
I don’t know why they said it,

00:42:24.528 --> 00:42:26.599
but this is the Primordial Mother, no doubt.

00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:30.246
Because you have the God, the Father,

00:42:30.429 --> 00:42:31.585
God the Son,

00:42:31.786 --> 00:42:33.512
and what about the Mother?

00:42:33.687 --> 00:42:36.044
That's the Holy Ghost.  It is a mystery.

00:42:36.245 --> 00:42:37.815
It's no mystery for us.

00:42:38.016 --> 00:42:40.640
You will know that the Holy Ghost is nothing else

00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:44.182
but the Primordial Mother called as ‘Adi Shakti’

00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:45.777
and by so many names.

00:42:45.978 --> 00:42:48.280
Like here is the river, is called as ‘Parramatta’,

00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:52.000
is the Primordial Mother. Is a absolutely a Sanskrit word.

00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:54.823
`Parramatta´ is absolutely Sanskrit word

00:42:55.024 --> 00:42:57.326
saying Primordial Mother [Param Mata].

00:42:58.120 --> 00:43:03.520
So this Mother is not going to give any trouble to you whatsoever.

00:43:03.720 --> 00:43:06.880
And those who say so, because they do not know how to do it,

00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:11.187
they want to frighten you and keep you away from reality.

00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:14.680
They have no authority. If they had divine authority,

00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:17.677
if they had some ways and methods of saying so,

00:43:17.878 --> 00:43:19.383
they would have said so.

00:43:19.571 --> 00:43:22.240
Like many people also say that the time has also not come.

00:43:22.441 --> 00:43:25.280
Because they don’t know how to do it.

00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:29.936
That’s why they are postponing it. It is very selfish, I should say,

00:43:30.137 --> 00:43:34.799
or all self-opiniatedness that to say that this is so and this is so.

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:38.080
The Kundalini of course will never trouble you.

00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:40.352
But if you try wrong methods

00:43:40.519 --> 00:43:42.730
then naturally there is a heat in the body

00:43:42.931 --> 00:43:44.920
and the deities get angry with you,

00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:48.612
the innocence gets angry and tortures you.

00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:52.160
These false gurus who have come all over,

00:43:52.360 --> 00:43:54.639
I am ashamed of them and they are the ones

00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:56.977
who have mesmerized and taken money from you.

00:43:57.178 --> 00:43:59.080
I mean how can they take money from you

00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:01.561
and how can they be your gurus when they are taking

00:44:01.762 --> 00:44:04.902
all this kind of money from you? Just think of it.

00:44:05.103 --> 00:44:07.005
They are just you have retained them,

00:44:07.206 --> 00:44:09.160
they are like your servants I should say.

00:44:09.361 --> 00:44:11.640
They have no self respect.

00:44:14.756 --> 00:44:16.800
All right, you can pay for this hall all right.

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:20.640
But you can’t pay for your Self Realization.

00:44:30.571 --> 00:44:36.847
L: Do You teach a system of [unclear] the chakras

00:44:37.016 --> 00:44:41.475
is necessary and do You describe [unclear].

00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:46.360
SY: Do You teach a method of cleansing the chakras?

00:44:46.599 --> 00:44:51.799
SM: Of course, of course.
L: [unclear]  SM: Of course.

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:54.194
We have a very good center here

00:44:54.395 --> 00:44:57.116
and we have very capable Sahaja Yogis,

00:44:57.275 --> 00:45:01.728
those who know how to cleanse your own chakras and everything.

00:45:01.929 --> 00:45:05.448
Of course, that's the minimum.

00:45:06.297 --> 00:45:09.200
And you yourself will be equipped with it.

00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:12.662
You yourself will know all these things.

00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:17.400
All that will be done. Is not just this lecture.

00:45:17.601 --> 00:45:20.560
There is a follow on. Please, all of you should come.

00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:23.280
It is not only Me, they also know everything

00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:26.559
and you will also know everything. That’s how it is going to spread.

00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:29.440
Like one enlightened light enlightens another

00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:33.360
and then that enlightened light enlightens another person.

00:45:33.560 --> 00:45:36.720
They are very very equipped here. They know everything about it.

00:45:36.920 --> 00:45:38.720
They have My lectures and things also.

00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:40.680
The main thing is they know everything

00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:44.111
and you have to know everything yourself.

00:45:49.043 --> 00:45:53.503
L: May I just ask You, humans don't carry the burden of original sin?

00:45:55.920 --> 00:45:58.760
SY: Do we still carry the burden of original sin?

00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:02.560
SM: No, not at all. It’s over now. Time is over.

00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:05.360
The original sin only brought us to ignorance

00:46:05.560 --> 00:46:07.520
and we started searching ourselves.

00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:09.440
Otherwise things would have been much better

00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:11.156
if we had not gone into it.

00:46:11.357 --> 00:46:12.928
But whatever it is, is now

00:46:13.080 --> 00:46:16.279
you had to come through a very circuitous way to understand.

00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:20.856
Because human beings, you see, as they were at that time, also

00:46:21.057 --> 00:46:23.160
wanted to find out about themselves.

00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:26.680
So God said, "All right, you have this freedom."

00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:29.640
Only human beings have the freedom, not the animals.

00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:32.237
Animals are called as ‘Pashu’ means they are under bond,

00:46:32.412 --> 00:46:34.261
they are under the bondage of God,

00:46:34.462 --> 00:46:37.640
and is already all controlled by Him.

00:46:37.840 --> 00:46:41.400
For example a scorpion is a scorpion, snake is a snake,

00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:45.080
they keep to their own dharma, means their own valences,

00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:47.280
their own religion, we can call it.

00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:50.320
They don’t change. But human beings can be a scorpion,

00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:54.200
can be lion, can be tiger, can be anything.

00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:57.560
They just shoot out like Jack in the box, you know.

00:46:57.760 --> 00:46:59.618
Sometimes you don’t know what’s the matter

00:46:59.819 --> 00:47:02.043
now suddenly from where it is coming?

00:47:02.265 --> 00:47:03.941
Is interesting, isn’t it?

00:47:04.142 --> 00:47:06.760
But then once you are realized you see it as drama,

00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:10.359
and you just see that whole thing is just working out

00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:12.297
in a very funny manner.

00:47:12.488 --> 00:47:15.223
You don’t take it so seriously as we normally do.

00:47:15.424 --> 00:47:17.440
And you just enjoy everything.

00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:20.439
And by your own countenance, by your own temperament,

00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:23.520
by your own character, people change.

00:47:23.720 --> 00:47:26.160
And they ask, "How are you like this?"

00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:29.360
Then you say that "We have become Sahaja Yogis,

00:47:29.560 --> 00:47:32.440
so they come to you and they become Sahaja Yogis, too.

00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:35.360
It's a wonderful area, it's a wonderful time

00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:38.120
and such wonderful people all over the world.

00:47:38.320 --> 00:47:41.594
Like I went to USSR, you will be surprised, USSR.

00:47:41.795 --> 00:47:46.240
And I never expected, they never have heard of any God or anything,

00:47:46.440 --> 00:47:49.560
and Christ also, they were just keeping Him aloof.

00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:51.554
And there it is the people,

00:47:51.705 --> 00:47:54.018
thousands they came and they got Realization,

00:47:54.209 --> 00:47:55.913
settled down into them, very deep people.

00:47:56.114 --> 00:47:59.448
They touched their depth. I was amazed. But the best part of it,

00:47:59.649 --> 00:48:02.280
that the Germans went to give them Realization.

00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:08.081
25 Germans rushed there, to help Me out. I was amazed, you see.

00:48:08.282 --> 00:48:11.018
And I said, "It must have cost you" , but they said, "Mother,

00:48:11.219 --> 00:48:13.890
what is the money for? We have to come for Russians".

00:48:14.091 --> 00:48:17.400
And such love and such understanding, you see.

00:48:17.600 --> 00:48:19.720
I was really touched by their beauty.

00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:24.715
Can you imagine Germans giving Realization to Russians?

00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:30.962
So beautiful it is to see their beauty expressing itself.

00:48:34.430 --> 00:48:37.945
Yes.
SY: One raised at the back.

00:48:38.389 --> 00:48:41.717
M: [unclear].

00:48:41.918 --> 00:48:45.925
How it will, what it represents [unclear]?

00:48:46.123 --> 00:48:48.114
How is it the divine state?

00:48:48.250 --> 00:48:52.241
And [unclear] what is guiding us now?

00:48:52.574 --> 00:48:55.703
And is it possible that some people have

00:48:55.910 --> 00:48:59.159
without particular effort  [unclear].

00:48:59.360 --> 00:49:01.686
SM: What is he saying?

00:49:26.268 --> 00:49:27.880
What is he talking?

00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:31.027
M: Mother, if rising Kundalini is what [unclear] ,

00:49:31.218 --> 00:49:33.985
how would You describe the current state?

00:49:34.186 --> 00:49:36.888
And what is it that is driving us now?

00:49:37.600 --> 00:49:38.896
SM: Driving you?

00:49:39.097 --> 00:49:41.843
SY: No, he said Kundalini is the [unclear] thing.

00:49:42.020 --> 00:49:46.333
Then Kundalini rises and that's how we wake up all of them,

00:49:46.534 --> 00:49:48.492
and that Realization [rises], Mother.

00:49:48.699 --> 00:49:51.363
What is the current state and what about the state are we [now]?

00:49:51.564 --> 00:49:56.120
SM: No, you are at a state which we call as human awareness at its best.

00:49:56.320 --> 00:50:00.400
When you start thinking "Why am I here on this earth?",

00:50:00.600 --> 00:50:05.200
you are trying to find out, because you see many things

00:50:05.400 --> 00:50:08.640
which do not satisfy you and you think this is not absolute.

00:50:08.840 --> 00:50:11.520
Why there are so many opinions about everything?

00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:13.954
Why people think differently?

00:50:14.105 --> 00:50:16.086
And all these things come to your mind.

00:50:16.287 --> 00:50:19.720
then you become what we call as a seeker of truth.

00:50:19.921 --> 00:50:24.080
Is that is the state, is ‘Sadaka’ and that seeking brings you here.

00:50:24.280 --> 00:50:26.161
And then you get your Realization.

00:50:26.362 --> 00:50:29.323
Those who are not seekers, I cannot force it on anyone.

00:50:29.514 --> 00:50:31.995
It has to work out, only on seekers.

00:50:32.196 --> 00:50:35.358
Those who just want to sort of test it and things like that

00:50:35.559 --> 00:50:38.788
doesn’t work out. Those who are really seeking the truth, it works out.

00:50:38.989 --> 00:50:41.600
I am sorry, it cannot be guaranteed for everyone.

00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:44.240
If you are really seeking the truth, it works out,

00:50:44.415 --> 00:50:46.184
otherwise it does not.

00:50:46.930 --> 00:50:48.142
So these are...

00:50:48.343 --> 00:50:51.760
This is the capacity in which you are here to seek the truth.

00:50:51.960 --> 00:50:53.593
All right?

00:50:57.997 --> 00:51:01.061
L: Could Mother talk on intellect and Self Realization

00:51:01.262 --> 00:51:06.319
and part that intellect plays [as part of the] Self Relaization.

00:51:06.520 --> 00:51:10.640
SY: What part does intellect play in the Self Realization?

00:51:10.840 --> 00:51:13.320
SM: After Realization, if you are really intelligent,

00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:17.160
in the way I would say that, detached intelligent,

00:51:17.320 --> 00:51:20.560
then you see it much better than anybody else.

00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:22.720
Because you see it and you are honest,

00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:25.280
you see that this is what is happening.

00:51:25.520 --> 00:51:30.040
And you are surprised. And you learn things much faster than others.

00:51:30.240 --> 00:51:33.880
So, I call it, it is a person who has a super intelligence, I call it,

00:51:34.759 --> 00:51:38.291
intelligence which has already reached a state to see

00:51:38.492 --> 00:51:40.327
that this is not true, this is not true.

00:51:40.528 --> 00:51:42.520
You reach a point when you know this is not true.

00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:44.560
That is the point you hit the right thing.

00:51:44.800 --> 00:51:47.530
So intelligence is very helpful.

00:51:47.737 --> 00:51:50.148
And you will be surprised, we have Sahaja Yogis,

00:51:50.349 --> 00:51:53.360
most of them, of very intelligent...

00:51:53.560 --> 00:51:55.495
They are first class, first of this university,

00:51:55.696 --> 00:51:58.680
first class, first of that university, I mean all of them are there.

00:51:58.880 --> 00:52:02.124
So you meet a person who has that sharp intelligence

00:52:02.325 --> 00:52:03.600
to see things also.

00:52:03.760 --> 00:52:07.560
Also a person who is not so intelligent,

00:52:07.800 --> 00:52:11.400
but is so dedicated and is so loving,

00:52:11.560 --> 00:52:15.040
so purely loving people out of just love that is in,

00:52:15.241 --> 00:52:16.792
such people are also very good.

00:52:16.993 --> 00:52:18.998
But in any case you don’t first judge yourself,

00:52:19.199 --> 00:52:21.215
that is the first point. You are not to judge,

00:52:21.416 --> 00:52:22.923
your Kundalini knows you very well.

00:52:23.124 --> 00:52:26.759
So please don’t judge yourself, let your Kundalini judge you.

00:52:26.960 --> 00:52:28.951
Now should we have now the session for...?

00:52:29.152 --> 00:52:31.659
SY: It's just one question.
SM: One more? Yes, say...

00:52:31.860 --> 00:52:35.829
M: Is that [unclear] of the yoga before...  hatha yoga?

00:52:36.030 --> 00:52:38.080
Could you speak on Kriya Yoga?

00:52:38.281 --> 00:52:42.321
SM: Same thing, Kriya Yoga is the same, which I told you or Raja.

00:52:42.521 --> 00:52:44.221
Sahaja Yoga is ’a-Kriya’ yoga.

00:52:44.396 --> 00:52:46.999
‘Kriya’ means when you do something is ‘Kriya Yoga'

00:52:47.200 --> 00:52:50.280
and “A-Kriya’ yoga is Sahaja Yoga.

00:52:50.480 --> 00:52:51.781
I don’t do anything.

00:52:51.948 --> 00:52:54.370
Without doing anything it works out, is the point.

00:52:54.571 --> 00:52:57.160
But, of course, you have to know your centers,

00:52:57.360 --> 00:52:59.840
you have to know how to nourish them, that is different.

00:53:00.049 --> 00:53:02.850
But ’Kriya’ yoga is something as I've told you,

00:53:03.051 --> 00:53:04.383
is just like ‘Raja yoga’.

00:53:04.584 --> 00:53:06.275
Without starting the Kundalini,

00:53:06.474 --> 00:53:09.662
you start sort of moving your chakras and things,

00:53:09.863 --> 00:53:12.160
it doesn’t work out.

00:53:12.528 --> 00:53:14.138
That's it.

00:53:14.920 --> 00:53:18.160
It has reached nowhere. You see, you must see the results.

00:53:18.360 --> 00:53:19.665
You must see the results.

00:53:19.856 --> 00:53:21.788
First of all when you go to any one of them,

00:53:21.989 --> 00:53:24.920
first you must see those who have been there,

00:53:25.120 --> 00:53:28.480
and see what is their capability, how they are.

00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:30.631
Unless and until you see them,

00:53:30.806 --> 00:53:35.051
why should you go to those people?

00:53:35.360 --> 00:53:37.371
Because they claim something, you shouldn’t.

00:53:37.572 --> 00:53:40.436
You must find out what are their disciples like? How are they?

00:53:40.637 --> 00:53:43.084
What sort of people they are? What have they achieved?

00:53:43.285 --> 00:53:45.137
And then go there. As a Mother, I would say

00:53:45.338 --> 00:53:47.880
what, what has these gurus given you? Nothing.

00:53:48.040 --> 00:53:50.338
They have made you broke.

00:53:50.539 --> 00:53:53.621
You have... so many are bankrupt, so many are sick,

00:53:53.828 --> 00:53:55.206
so many people are sick.

00:53:55.407 --> 00:53:58.040
This Rajnish’s disciples are so sick, you don’t know.

00:53:58.240 --> 00:54:00.160
When they come to Me, first they faint.

00:54:00.360 --> 00:54:02.102
I get so frightened with them.

00:54:02.303 --> 00:54:06.596
They faint, actually. You see, I'm really frightened, poor things.

00:54:10.480 --> 00:54:12.920
Horrible diseases have been created by them,

00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:15.560
and some people have got blood cancer from them.

00:54:15.800 --> 00:54:17.348
All kinds of things have happened.

00:54:17.549 --> 00:54:20.187
Is all very bad type of mesmerism,

00:54:20.388 --> 00:54:22.260
which you will know what it is later on.

00:54:22.461 --> 00:54:26.080
So those who have been to these gurus also are suffering today.

00:54:26.280 --> 00:54:29.435
You pay to get sick. Can you imagine?

00:54:37.600 --> 00:54:40.560
And you are all seekers, you see, that's My concern.

00:54:40.760 --> 00:54:43.240
So every seeker has a right to get his yoga.

00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:47.240
Every seeker has a right. No doubt.

00:54:47.400 --> 00:54:51.240
But if you are not seeking, I cannot force on you. I cannot.

00:54:51.480 --> 00:54:54.880
I respect your freedom. If you want you can go to heaven,

00:54:55.080 --> 00:54:58.640
if you want you can go to hell. It is very simple.

00:54:58.840 --> 00:55:00.762
One boy asked Me, "How do you go to hell?"

00:55:00.963 --> 00:55:04.480
I said, "You take two running jumps and you are there."

00:55:05.480 --> 00:55:08.915
What a question to ask?

00:55:09.245 --> 00:55:11.520
When I am talking of heaven, he is asking about hell.

00:55:11.721 --> 00:55:14.160
So, I said this is what it is.

00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:21.806
Now, finished I think.

00:55:21.989 --> 00:55:23.519
Now, madam, again.

00:55:23.720 --> 00:55:26.610
I think... Can we postpone it now?

00:55:26.848 --> 00:55:29.501
All right. You see what I am saying all these questions,

00:55:29.702 --> 00:55:33.040
even if I answer - because I'm very good at answering every question

00:55:33.240 --> 00:55:36.000
and I don’t have to think about them -

00:55:36.200 --> 00:55:39.238
but that answer is not sufficient.

00:55:39.439 --> 00:55:41.055
You have to get your awakening.

00:55:41.231 --> 00:55:45.279
That is not sufficient to satisfy you. It is not going to work out.

00:55:45.480 --> 00:55:50.311
You have to get it, is the point. All right?

00:55:55.160 --> 00:55:58.439
Now as I have told you, those who do not want to have it,

00:55:58.640 --> 00:56:00.841
should please leave the hall.

00:56:01.635 --> 00:56:04.326
There is no problem on that. I will never feel bad about it,

00:56:04.527 --> 00:56:06.716
because also you must know there's

00:56:09.280 --> 00:56:12.087
no force can be done.

00:56:12.270 --> 00:56:15.472
Those who really want it should be here and should oblige.

00:56:15.673 --> 00:56:17.811
That's being very civil.

00:56:22.040 --> 00:56:26.480
Those people who are standing can sit here and they... yes...

00:56:49.720 --> 00:56:52.362
SY: [Shri Ma] should we put the air-conditioning off?

00:56:52.563 --> 00:56:56.618
Should we put the air-conditioning off so that is clear it's not...

00:56:57.094 --> 00:56:59.411
SM: No, I mean, they won’t doubt it.

00:56:59.612 --> 00:57:01.516
SY: Just mention it.

00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:07.000
SM: If you want we can put off the air conditioning

00:57:07.160 --> 00:57:08.920
because then you should not doubt

00:57:09.120 --> 00:57:11.280
that you got cool breeze out of your head.

00:57:11.480 --> 00:57:13.680
After all your head is giving the cool breeze,

00:57:13.880 --> 00:57:15.559
that doesn’t mean the air conditioning

00:57:15.760 --> 00:57:18.680
is coming through your head, isn’t it?

00:57:25.310 --> 00:57:26.943
Actually, you see, people doubt

00:57:27.134 --> 00:57:29.059
because they don’t know what to expect.

00:57:29.260 --> 00:57:33.120
But for us it is very easy to understand,

00:57:33.280 --> 00:57:36.790
because already described what to expect after Self Realization,

00:57:36.991 --> 00:57:39.280
is described by Adi Shankaracharya

00:57:39.481 --> 00:57:42.200
‘salilam’, ’salilam’, is the cool breeze.

00:57:42.400 --> 00:57:45.240
Also cool breeze of the Holy Ghost is described in the Bible,

00:57:45.440 --> 00:57:48.160
also described the tree of life, which is this one.

00:57:48.360 --> 00:57:50.920
So many things, but you see, is not so clear cut.

00:57:51.120 --> 00:57:54.360
As it is Christ had very little time to talk to people.

00:57:54.561 --> 00:57:57.501
I mean, just imagine He was crucified.

00:57:57.930 --> 00:58:00.240
How much time they gave Him to talk publicly?

00:58:00.440 --> 00:58:04.080
I am the only one who has outclassed all, lots of things.

00:58:04.280 --> 00:58:09.520
Because now I am 67 and nobody lived like Me for so many years.

00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:13.280
They just finished Him off at a very early age.

00:58:13.480 --> 00:58:16.000
That is the trouble. Nobody understood them.

00:58:16.200 --> 00:58:20.968
No saint has lived as long as I have lived so far, somehow.

00:58:26.680 --> 00:58:28.718
All right.

00:58:30.800 --> 00:58:33.340
So a simple thing is,

00:58:33.541 --> 00:58:38.282
first I must tell you the conditions, two conditions.

00:58:38.483 --> 00:58:40.880
First one is

00:58:42.120 --> 00:58:45.880
that you are not to feel guilty at all.

00:58:46.080 --> 00:58:48.719
You have to forget the past.

00:58:48.920 --> 00:58:52.039
You have to be in the present.

00:58:52.240 --> 00:58:55.497
Forget the past, forgive yourself.

00:58:56.840 --> 00:59:01.480
Because, as I told you, the Divine is the ocean of forgiveness

00:59:01.680 --> 00:59:05.120
and you cannot do anything that cannot be forgiven

00:59:05.320 --> 00:59:11.480
by that greatness of forgiveness.

00:59:11.680 --> 00:59:15.920
So please, forgive completely yourself

00:59:16.120 --> 00:59:18.520
and know that you are not guilty at all.

00:59:18.720 --> 00:59:20.015
Supposing you were guilty,

00:59:20.216 --> 00:59:22.379
you would have been in jail. Why are you here?

00:59:22.580 --> 00:59:25.748
So now don’t jump on to small, small things,

00:59:25.949 --> 00:59:28.120
which you think is creating guilt.

00:59:28.320 --> 00:59:33.069
So not to feel guilty at all, first point.

00:59:33.680 --> 00:59:37.249
The second one is that you have to forgive everyone.

00:59:37.450 --> 00:59:40.259
Just forgive every one. Not to think whom to forgive,

00:59:40.460 --> 00:59:42.560
why to forgive, what they have done to you.

00:59:42.760 --> 00:59:46.680
But just to forgive them, logically to understand is

00:59:46.920 --> 00:59:49.622
that whether you forgive or don’t forgive,

00:59:49.813 --> 00:59:51.399
you don’t do anything.

00:59:51.600 --> 00:59:54.280
Whether you forgive someone or don’t forgive,

00:59:54.480 --> 00:59:57.360
you don’t have to do anything about it.

00:59:57.560 --> 01:00:01.600
But if you don’t forgive then you play into wrong hands.

01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:04.280
I mean actually you are playing into the hands

01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:06.905
who wanted to trouble you.

01:00:07.143 --> 01:00:09.703
So when you forgive, that person is out of your mind

01:00:09.870 --> 01:00:11.919
and no tortures anymore left.

01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:15.774
So you have to forgive and this is what is the teaching of Christ,

01:00:15.975 --> 01:00:20.080
if you remember, that "forgive them those who trespass against us

01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:23.400
for we forgive them those who trespass against us".

01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:27.000
This is a very great weapon Christ has given us.

01:00:27.160 --> 01:00:30.800
So from your heart you must just forgive everyone.

01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:34.640
These are the only two conditions we have.

01:00:38.985 --> 01:00:40.641
All right.

01:00:41.125 --> 01:00:44.755
So another thing is that we have to take help of the Mother Earth.

01:00:44.956 --> 01:00:48.080
So would be nice if we can take out our shoes at least,

01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:51.760
and keep them on one side.

01:01:00.680 --> 01:01:04.720
It is such a truth that we have so many Jews now

01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:06.698
who worship Christ

01:01:06.866 --> 01:01:11.325
and so many Hindus who worship Mohammad Sahab.

01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:13.719
Such a truth.

01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:21.760
Complete integration.
