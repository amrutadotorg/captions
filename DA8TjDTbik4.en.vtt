WEBVTT

00:01.920 --> 00:06.520
What experience! It's [UNCLEAR], so they
had just [UNCLEAR]

00:06.520 --> 00:09.888
and started putting out something
[UNCLEAR] and

00:10.606 --> 00:16.406
from somewhere three very hefty people
came in, absolutely black in color,

00:16.456 --> 00:22.084
very hefty and tall [UNCLEAR] and they
caught hold of them and they beat them

00:22.344 --> 00:27.212
but they never got hurt as such and
brought them on the street and [UNCLEAR]

00:27.212 --> 00:29.952
and, "Go back to [UNCLEAR] and
never come to this man,"

00:30.483 --> 00:35.223
so they kept [UNCLEAR] said,
"Alright [UNCLEAR]," and said,

00:35.244 --> 00:39.324
"What kind of a kadak Devta you
have?" Kadak means, a very strong.

00:39.416 --> 00:44.916
"Who is this Kadak devta you worship
that they beat us like this." So,

00:46.136 --> 00:48.806
what has happened you're so...?

00:49.720 --> 00:52.548
- In my own case even, I would say
- Hmm?

00:52.548 --> 00:54.610
- I'll tell You my own case
- Hmm

00:54.610 --> 00:57.229
- when I'll say
- Hmm!

00:57.249 --> 00:59.459
- [UNCLEAR]
- Hmm!

01:00.150 --> 01:06.670
I was being attacked by a group of tribes
Mother and they had wanted to kill me

01:07.468 --> 01:13.438
and they came with a sword to cut my head
in two but instead of getting my head

01:13.445 --> 01:18.535
or my arteries here, they just got my ear.
Twice he tried. Each time it's really

01:18.535 --> 01:24.941
hard to get, then at that point I prayed.
I said, "If this is the time to go, then

01:24.941 --> 01:30.599
I'm prepared but, You know, I give my
Spirit into Your hands," and at that moment

01:30.599 --> 01:34.740
everything became very bright, I don't know
how and although they were 15 or 16 people,

01:34.740 --> 01:38.863
they could not hold my hands, they didn't
have the strength and all alone, I just

01:38.863 --> 01:44.849
- walked away from them. They could not
- And then 200 little boys came from

01:44.849 --> 01:46.530
- some school there
- That's right, 200 children

01:46.530 --> 01:52.610
And they caught hold of him and took him
to the hospital and in the hospital he had

01:52.610 --> 01:57.322
somebody surgeon, whom he knew
- what just was passing that way.

01:57.584 --> 02:02.184
Haan. You see, what happened is that, 200
children came, they took me to the dispensary

02:02.206 --> 02:05.984
and then, everyone was asleep in the
afternoon so they knocked in the door and

02:05.984 --> 02:08.632
all people came out and they said,
"Shall we get an ambulance?"

02:08.632 --> 02:12.891
At that moment, another doctor, whom I
knew, was passing by. He saw the crowd,

02:12.891 --> 02:17.866
came, he saw me, took me into his car, took
me to the hospital. Now that was lunch time,

02:17.866 --> 02:20.387
so all the surgeons should
have been at home

02:20.387 --> 02:23.476
but by chance, every surgeon
in the hospital was there.

02:24.179 --> 02:28.649
And he carried his ear like this and put
it diagonal. He's a doctor he knows how to

02:28.649 --> 02:32.291
- [UNCLEAR] and he sensed it.
- It was completely cut off, with no

02:32.291 --> 02:36.138
- blood vessels not, it was just..
- In India you were where?

02:36.138 --> 02:38.383
- In Calcutta.
- Yes, in Jamshedpur.

02:38.383 --> 02:42.391
- You know, I met Shri Mataji here.
- And then when you were [UNCLEAR]

02:42.660 --> 02:45.930
- You are Gujarati's - are you?
- Hmm

02:45.930 --> 02:48.899
- And he's also Gujarati?
- Hmm. We both are Brahma Kshatriya.

02:48.899 --> 02:51.116
- Annh? Kshatriyas?
- Brahma Kshatriya

02:51.116 --> 02:54.159
- So what is you sir name?
- Thakur, Thakur.

02:54.159 --> 03:00.827
Thakur, haan. Kshatriyas are very good for
Sahaja yog - people who are realized, hmm.

03:04.258 --> 03:11.188
- So you came from West Africa also?
- Nai, I'm from Ahmedabad. Ahmedabad is Baroda.

03:11.238 --> 03:14.818
- Achcha! [UNCLEAR]
- Can speak Maharashtra.

03:14.818 --> 03:21.200
- Achcha! Hmm
- It is Jogian and boys they calling me

03:21.200 --> 03:27.910
they say , "Shrivastava, Shrivastava," and
we were talking in we say, " Shrivastav"

03:28.380 --> 03:35.140
Shrivastav is correct. Shrivastav is
correct [UNCLEAR]. Shrivastav

03:35.140 --> 03:41.921
[UNCLEAR] has left his Hanuman Chalisa and
asked me to type in English. Translate Sanskrit.

03:42.467 --> 03:45.337
- But My husband is from U.P.
- I see.

03:45.337 --> 03:49.579
But Baroda we had very good center there.
You see, they could not continue with it

03:49.579 --> 03:53.165
because the gentleman, who was Veeranjali
- you must have heard his name?

03:53.334 --> 03:55.704
- I left Baroda on [UNCLEAR]
- Oh, I see.

03:55.704 --> 04:00.330
- I'm not friend of anyone
- He started, you see, that thing and

04:00.330 --> 04:05.725
then he's now very sick - sick in the sense
he's very old - wife is also very old, so

04:05.725 --> 04:11.121
somehow it's not so working out but
now, Raolbai has gone there - another

04:11.121 --> 04:15.160
Sahaja yogini, who's very powerful, she's
gone there, so it'll start again, I think,

04:15.160 --> 04:20.308
- in Baroda. Ahmedabad also we had this Shodhan
- Shodhan, haan

04:20.308 --> 04:25.962
Shodhan bhai, who did a lot for us but
Ahmedabad, you see, people are very

04:25.962 --> 04:28.101
- materialistic, I think.
- Very much

04:28.101 --> 04:33.843
Extremely materialistic and they were just
bothered about sickness or money problems

04:33.843 --> 04:35.351
- this, that
- Money minded

04:35.351 --> 04:38.344
Extremely money minded and very much
worried about money, this thing.

04:38.344 --> 04:41.828
Everybody came to say," Sarabhai, this,
that," because all had these problems.

04:41.828 --> 04:45.990
I got fed up, I said, "I'll not go to
Ahmedabad," you see, because you must have

04:45.990 --> 04:50.611
spiritual hankering, isn't it? Otherwise
it is such a waste sometimes to speak.

04:50.611 --> 04:55.724
They'll come later on. Let us first settle
down with Sahaja yogis, who are good

04:55.724 --> 05:00.730
and who are spiritually endowed, who are
spiritually strong, then gradually,

05:00.730 --> 05:08.524
these people will come. Now, we had a
television program and what I hear is that

05:08.524 --> 05:13.820
thousands of people have [UNCLEAR] . If I
didn't have Sahaja yogis, it's impossible.

05:13.820 --> 05:19.138
You know, every program I had 400, 500
people and curing them, doing this but

05:19.138 --> 05:26.050
even sitting down on the pulpit, people
were getting cured - just sitting down there.

05:26.050 --> 05:30.589
That's one way you cure but still, you have
to attend to them, you'll have to tell them.

05:30.589 --> 05:35.151
You need Sahaja yogis first, then you
can attend to the masses - isn't it?

05:41.746 --> 05:48.670
But, I think, with money-mindedness in
Ahmadabad, they follow others.

05:48.670 --> 05:52.947
If one start and he's strong enough
Sahaja yogi, then they will follow

05:52.947 --> 05:55.886
but one has to be strongly through.

05:55.886 --> 06:00.515
No, we, we had Shodhan bhai but Shodhan
bhai got lost because he got very sick.

06:00.515 --> 06:05.435
He also became very old, you see, but his
wife and all that are [UNCLEAR] quite a lot

06:05.501 --> 06:12.081
and the problem is, when people are money
minded, you see, they get enamored by

06:12.081 --> 06:19.601
other gurus who take money, they sort of
survive to see things, which, as if it

06:19.601 --> 06:24.462
solves their money problem. Like, they will
go and ask anyone the number of the horse,

06:24.462 --> 06:30.957
you see, sort of thing. They like such horrible
gurus [UNCLEAR] and such people prosper.

06:31.313 --> 06:35.073
Ahmadabad has got lots of gurus,
horrible gurus.

06:35.073 --> 06:42.446
- We were that until boys came.
- Really? So many horrible gurus!

06:42.446 --> 06:53.217
Till that night in my house we had first,
first group and that night they went to

06:53.438 --> 07:01.988
[UNCLEAR] and threw away everything in the
sea - everything, so that's how we are saved

07:01.988 --> 07:05.713
- or we are here today in one piece.
- He was Mahishasur.

07:05.713 --> 07:07.507
- Who?
- Mahishasur

07:07.507 --> 07:13.461
Mahishasura? Baap re, he's the worst of
all. The worst is, he gives heart attack.

07:14.549 --> 07:17.499
- Troubles.
- So [UNCLEAR]

07:17.499 --> 07:19.364
- He suffered so much
- Heart

07:19.364 --> 07:22.919
- except for his hands and
- the husband always gets it.

07:22.919 --> 07:27.770
I've seen if the wife is that, husband
always gets the [UNCLEAR]. My own brother,

07:28.294 --> 07:32.564
my own brother from the day I
told him, he threw away everything.

07:32.570 --> 07:38.880
That night, that day, I don't know it just
came over. This little fellow and Cole and

07:38.880 --> 07:44.771
Shailesh and Allan everything black dustbin
bag and threw everything that night.

07:44.771 --> 07:49.390
- We were in Brisbane.
- You see, we must think we don't want

07:49.390 --> 07:54.516
diamonds, we don't want to wrong Gods, you see,
so this fellow is giving diamonds, this, that, wrong...

07:54.516 --> 08:00.504
Yeah, if you are sort of near, you get
this, if you are, you get saris, if you are,

08:00.504 --> 08:03.149
- then get diamond ring.
- Only to the rich

08:03.408 --> 08:06.838
- Yes
- Only to the rich. For example, My brother

08:07.441 --> 08:12.581
they gave him a ring. So, I told him, "How
many you have diamond rings?" He said,

08:12.581 --> 08:16.586
"I don't know how many I have. I never wear
them." So I said, "Why did you take these?"

08:16.586 --> 08:21.183
He said, " Because he said it is my blessing."
I said, "But why does he give you a diamond?

08:21.250 --> 08:24.969
If he has to give it, give it to somebody
who doesn't have. For example your driver,

08:24.969 --> 08:28.982
if he gives him this diamond ring, it has
some value." But then you know,

08:28.982 --> 08:34.583
we discovered that My sister-in-law was
giving unconsciously all her diamonds to him.

08:37.384 --> 08:43.004
I don't know, I accidently believe it,
property, money

08:43.418 --> 08:48.168
She was just passing on to him without
knowing that she's doing it, you see,

08:48.168 --> 08:51.986
because they were having, they just found
out that they have lost lot of diamonds

08:51.986 --> 08:57.912
from the household and then she said, "Yes,
I gave him, I gave him this time that thing."

08:57.912 --> 09:02.060
So, I asked her, "Why did you give?"- she's a doctor - I said, "Why did you give him?"

09:02.074 --> 09:05.664
He said, she said, "You see, somebody
tells me all the time, 'These are stones,

09:05.664 --> 09:10.617
why do you want to have? Give it to baba.'"
I said, "If he is a sanyasi, then if these are

09:10.626 --> 09:16.236
stones to you, it should be dust to him. Why
should he take it? Why should he take all these?

09:16.237 --> 09:20.757
It's alright, as you are married to him and
my brother is respectable man, whatever

09:20.757 --> 09:24.927
it is, he has money and all that, as his
wife as Grihalaxmi, you have to wear this,

09:24.927 --> 09:29.722
you have to have them but why for this sanyasi
baba? And to take somebody else's diamonds,

09:29.722 --> 09:36.985
what is this I...?" And they have amassed
money, amassed. If you read about this

09:36.985 --> 09:47.151
Mahesh Yogi, recently I read, he has collected
4000 crores of rupees. Crores, 4000 crores.

09:47.151 --> 09:53.362
I have seen in front of my eyes that if
you give this much, then you get into

09:53.362 --> 10:00.669
you will see them like that. The lady, the
poor lady had a epileptic fit there.

10:00.669 --> 10:07.570
Really, she was fit in heat sitting down and
those women volunteer, whatever they were,

10:07.570 --> 10:14.411
they give sit to her, "You sit properly, sit
properly," and then baba walked like that

10:14.411 --> 10:20.089
and that lady got sudden fit and fell, You
know, so, "Why all this, why do you allow

10:20.089 --> 10:24.660
these people to come in here? Get out, take
them out. Get out of my ashram," like that.

10:25.598 --> 10:31.798
- Anyway, I think, inhuman like the ....
- Because sometimes even you see these people

10:31.798 --> 10:36.906
give them to stress, if they want to get
rid of somebody, they can just be

10:36.906 --> 10:39.513
like this stupid, if they want.

10:44.604 --> 10:47.244
[UNCLEAR] you the twenty times.

10:53.465 --> 10:58.215
There's no meditation, nothing, you see,
they don't talk of God or anything - nothing.

10:58.564 --> 11:06.074
- Just nothing, I mean, it is - I don't know.
- We had to bring, my husband himself

11:06.126 --> 11:11.576
they raided that night and tell him
and I don't know what came after [UNCLEAR - 6000?]

11:11.576 --> 11:19.631
Mondays on the telephone, he threw away
everything. On the telephone they wiped

11:19.631 --> 11:21.971
- out yogi,
- He's a Thakur, na

11:22.100 --> 11:26.625
- so they telephoned and
- [IN HINDI - It's said that once something
goes wrong in a Thakur's head]

11:26.625 --> 11:28.565
Thakur can take talwar

11:28.565 --> 11:37.440
You see Thakur, Thakur is a caste, I mean,
it's a caste of great brave men, so once a

11:37.653 --> 11:44.703
they say, that once a rich man in Lucknow
employed one Thakur, you see, protect him,

11:44.703 --> 11:52.042
very healthy man and they were passing through
some jungles and some dacoits invaded him,

11:52.042 --> 11:59.654
sort of, attacked and so he had about ten
people, who were carrying everything;

11:59.654 --> 12:06.196
You know that caught all the ten people and
they whipped them and did all kinds of things

12:06.196 --> 12:12.907
with them and all that and after the ten
were absolutely thrown on the grounds

12:13.209 --> 12:19.049
then, this fellow, you see, Thakur raised
his moustaches and hit all of them and

12:19.049 --> 12:27.230
threw them off, so when they came back,
the gentleman, who was his master gave him

12:27.230 --> 12:32.355
lots of property and even things and thanked
him, "You saved my life and did all of this,"

12:32.355 --> 12:38.094
and all that but now I cannot give him more
employment, so they asked him, "Why not?"

12:38.094 --> 12:44.395
He said, "Where will I get again ten
people to excite him?" [LAUGHTER]

12:44.435 --> 12:49.955
So, ten people first have to die to excite
him or to fall down on the ground then the

12:49.955 --> 12:54.359
only he will hit otherwise he's very
quiet. [SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS]

12:56.346 --> 13:01.626
Even in Maharashtra, these Marathas are
[UNCLEAR - STRONG?] but really active;

13:01.626 --> 13:05.413
Dhumaal is a Marathi. Most of them
are Marathas. [UNCLEAR] is a Maratha

13:05.413 --> 13:07.824
- Many Kshatriyas do Sahaja yog,
- Hmm.

13:07.824 --> 13:09.650
- The Brahmins
- Kshatriyas are the best, you see.

13:09.650 --> 13:14.906
We had this, one Mr.[UNCLEAR] in Sahaja
yoga. Very, very premature he is

13:18.820 --> 13:24.122
But jaise [UNCLEAR - BAANIYE?] log hote
hain [UNCLEAR] and others are

13:24.122 --> 13:27.832
Brahmins also because, you see,
they have so many ritualism with them.

13:28.137 --> 13:32.427
Marathas because they are brave and
courageous, they come in Sahaja yoga.

13:33.160 --> 13:36.650
[UNCLEAR], I think that mostly Kshatriyas
worshiped the Devi

13:36.650 --> 13:40.158
- Hmm. Haan of course, Shakti pujari, yes.
- Yes, that is the main thing.

13:40.158 --> 13:43.888
I mean, now see, I.P. Singh is a Kshatriya
and Nagendra Singh is a Kshatriya -

13:43.888 --> 13:48.599
- see all of them are like that.
- So they understand the value of

13:48.599 --> 13:50.979
- Kshatriya
- the Devi or Shakti

13:51.596 --> 13:56.146
[UNCLEAR] People of values - Devi ko
bahut maante hain

13:57.007 --> 14:01.197
- Put her out. Anyone has that [UNCLEAR]
- Chai aa gayi

14:01.197 --> 14:04.040
She's a combination
of two different traits.

14:10.095 --> 14:14.235
This Mrs. Gibbs is coming, I gather, here.
[UNCLEAR CONVERSATION]

14:14.235 --> 14:19.390
And she finds very difficult because
of the [UNCLEAR]

14:22.446 --> 14:29.356
So you all put your left hand towards Me, right
hand outside. Right hand outside and watch Me.

14:29.767 --> 14:33.418
Put both the feet on the ground, straight.

14:44.126 --> 14:52.226
Have you worked out anything about the diseases
you want to tackle [UNCLEAR] this one? Gavin

14:52.844 --> 14:54.884
- Lots of them, Shri Mataji
- Annh?

14:54.884 --> 14:58.179
- They are quite a few
- Quite a few. You need the whole day?

14:58.751 --> 15:01.261
- [UNCLEAR]
- We'll tell You the ones that have been requested.

15:01.261 --> 15:04.259
- So, tomorrow I'll be absolutely free
the whole day.
- That's great!

15:04.259 --> 15:06.803
Do you think tomorrow the whole
day I should give it to you?

15:06.803 --> 15:10.905
- I'm absolutely free because C.P's out.
- [UNCLEAR]

15:10.905 --> 15:13.935
- Annh?
- Thank You! Yes

15:13.935 --> 15:18.113
But we have to do something about it, you
see, because now we have to face so many.

15:18.625 --> 15:23.575
Better? How is it? Come here.
Come here. Just come

15:23.575 --> 15:28.802
- Take out your shoes.
- One big such disease is, Shri Mataji,

15:28.802 --> 15:32.970
- is all these mental illnesses.
- No, no left side attack. Now turn around

15:33.124 --> 15:37.180
- They are big problem
- Haan, left side. You see now, put it, go further

15:37.180 --> 15:42.795
For that, all the left sided problem should
be solved with a candle or light or fire.

15:42.942 --> 15:48.982
Anything that is light, see, is against
that - fire - all the left side.

15:48.982 --> 15:54.914
Now this one also has a left side problem.
So, what do you have to do, is to raise his right.

15:55.480 --> 16:00.490
- Left
- Now see. It does this in light.

16:01.471 --> 16:06.251
Be careful about them. Also watch the
flame; Flame will indicate to you.

16:09.265 --> 16:12.115
Now put it to the left.

16:18.955 --> 16:22.295
Left Swadhishthana

16:32.509 --> 16:36.879
- It's coming.
- Really it is coming out - you feel it.

16:36.893 --> 16:39.943
All the pressure on the void is
released

16:49.756 --> 16:57.646
- It's trying to show
- Unnh!
- and the heart has to be released.

16:57.646 --> 17:01.707
That's the Jagdamba's seat because
He's 'Neh Chaturya,' you see.

17:01.707 --> 17:07.636
Now, for him, now what is the first
problem, is the void. Void problem is there

17:07.636 --> 17:13.360
because he had a wrong guru, you see. Because
he's on the left hand side, he should put his

17:13.360 --> 17:18.704
right hand towards the left hand side. Put
his right hand towards the left hand side.

17:21.949 --> 17:27.319
I saw some photographs, Shri Mataji of this
Mahishasur, where he puts his photograph

17:27.319 --> 17:31.743
- inside the Lingam of Lord Shiva
- Hmm, so?

17:31.743 --> 17:33.661
- Mahishasur
- Oh!

17:33.661 --> 17:38.546
There's a photograph where there's a Lingam,
Shiva's Lingam and he put his photograph inside it.

17:38.546 --> 17:43.210
That's it. That's how you reach the heart.
Now put his, no, I'm saying, put your -

17:43.210 --> 17:47.527
this is your left hand this side, that's
your right hand - alright?

17:51.129 --> 17:57.419
This Lingam is given by Mahishasur to his
father and he worships it everyday

17:57.419 --> 18:01.899
- Baap re!
- from 3 0'clock in the morning till 10 at night

18:02.943 --> 18:05.123
- Now
- in the house.

18:05.564 --> 18:11.148
Ab Rustom dekho? Ab iska shuru.
Behavior, very aggressive.

18:13.178 --> 18:18.298
- Joy comes up to Vishuddhi's petals, Vishuddhi
- His Vishuddhi is blocked very much.

18:18.298 --> 18:20.091
- Right?
- Central, Mother
- Right

18:20.091 --> 18:25.140
Central some blood cells - Sushumna has
blood cells just below the Vishuddhi.

18:25.831 --> 18:28.891
He never said Vishudhi. So
he has said mantras?

18:28.918 --> 18:34.898
- Hmm. Already, it's clearing
- Hmm. The whole thing has gone to heart
now - right heart

18:34.898 --> 18:39.056
But basically - you see this one - now
where did you put your - haan, now you say

18:39.056 --> 18:42.861
- "Mother, I am my own guru"
- Mother, I am my own guru

18:42.861 --> 18:45.283
- Again
- Mother, I am my own guru

18:45.283 --> 18:47.605
- Again
- Mother, I am my own guru

18:47.605 --> 18:49.614
- Again
- Mother, I am my own guru

18:49.614 --> 18:52.231
- Again - ten times.
- Mother, I am my own guru

18:52.231 --> 18:54.585
- Again
- Mother I am my own guru

18:54.585 --> 18:57.149
- Again
- Mother, I am my own guru

18:57.149 --> 18:59.744
- Again
- Mother, I am my own guru

19:01.734 --> 19:04.054
- Unnh
- Hmm, not sure.

19:04.054 --> 19:06.384
- What! Cleared out
- Even Vishuddhi gets [UNCLEAR]

19:06.384 --> 19:10.912
Now see. [IN HINDI - No, now come in front and
clear his properly].... he's with Mahishasura, so

19:10.912 --> 19:16.183
[UNCLEAR], the heart is catching,
center heart. Now, hold your breath

19:16.183 --> 19:19.684
and you should say, 'Jagdamba, Jagdamba,
Jagdamba' Aham saakshaat Jagdamba,

19:19.684 --> 19:23.377
Aham saakshaat Jagdamba, saakshaat
Jagdamba, Aham saakshaat Jagdamba

19:23.377 --> 19:26.545
Aham saakshaat Jagdamba, Aham
saakshaat Jagdamba, Aham saakshaat,

19:26.545 --> 19:30.158
- Jagdamba, Aham saakshaat Jagdamba
- Much better, yeah

19:30.158 --> 19:35.204
Now, go to the Vishuddhi. Now, it will be
more left Vishuddhi because of his mantra,

19:35.524 --> 19:39.104
so, Aham saakshaat sarva mantra siddhi,
Aham saakshaat sarva mantra siddhi,

19:39.104 --> 19:42.719
Aham saakshaat sarva mantra siddhi,
Aham saakshaat sarva mantra siddhi.

19:42.719 --> 19:46.481
Aham saakshaat Vishnumaya, Aham saakshaat
Vishnumaya, Aham saakshaat Vishnumaya,

19:46.481 --> 19:50.451
Aham saakshaat Vishnumaya, Aham saakshaat
Vishnumaya, Aham saakshaat Vishnumaya,

19:50.451 --> 19:54.802
saakshaat Vishnumaya, Aham saakshaat
Vishnumaya. Haan ho gaya. Now what is it?

19:54.802 --> 20:00.527
Eight times Vishnumaya and eight times
Mantra siddhi - it will work out.

20:02.376 --> 20:03.896
- Alright,
- Much better

20:03.896 --> 20:08.329
- Better now? Much better. Now agnya - left agnya
- That's it

20:08.329 --> 20:12.520
Would be always there. Aham saakshaat
Maha Ganesha Maha Bhairava,

20:12.520 --> 20:16.624
Aham saakshaat Maha Ganesha Maha Bhairava,
Aham saakshaat Maha Ganesha Maha Bhairava,

20:16.624 --> 20:20.392
saakshaat Maha Ganesha - here you'll
find people getting blind, you see.

20:20.392 --> 20:25.284
When they are blind, just ask them to put
one light in front and one light at the back;

20:25.284 --> 20:28.624
Just give it a bandhan. Saakshaat
Maha Ganesha Maha Bhairava,

20:28.624 --> 20:38.511
Aham saakshaat - haan. At this point even you
can say, 'Aham saakshat Mahishasur Mardini,

20:38.511 --> 20:42.612
Aham saakshat Mahishasur - at the Sahasrara,
you can say. Aham saakshat Mahishasur Mardini,

20:42.612 --> 20:46.174
Aham saakshat Mahishasur Mardini,
saakshat Mahishasur Mardini,

20:46.174 --> 20:49.556
Aham saakshat Mahishasur Mardini, Aham
saakshat Mahishasur Mardini,

20:49.556 --> 20:53.038
Aham saakshat Mahishasur Mardini,
Aham saakshat Mahishasur Mardini,

20:53.038 --> 20:59.111
Aham saakshat - Annh! it's there. Aham saakshat
Mokshdayini, Aham saakshat Mokshdayini,

20:59.111 --> 21:03.994
Aham saakshat Mokshdayini, saakshat
Mokshdayini, Aham saakshat Mokshdayini

21:03.994 --> 21:11.534
- Aham Saakshat Mokshdayini, Aham Saakshat.... Alright?
- [LAUGHTER]

21:11.534 --> 21:16.636
- There it is [UNCLEAR]
- Very easy kundalini to [UNCLEAR] Mother

21:16.636 --> 21:22.309
Very easy. Because you are realized souls
now, all the mantras are jagrut in you.

21:22.309 --> 21:27.509
Everything is jagrut. Whatever you say, is the
Truth, it has a meaning - see, it's cleared out.

21:27.509 --> 21:32.762
Put yourself into bandhan, that's all. Now don't feel
guilty - that's one thing you people don't do,

21:32.762 --> 21:36.727
is to feel guilty; You are facing Me
- what is there to feel guilty?

21:38.561 --> 21:40.471
- Now let's see his
- He's a very
- Forward

21:40.471 --> 21:44.704
- Sit down now.
- He suffered, he had suffered from asthma

21:44.704 --> 21:48.676
- and very bad chest trouble.
- That's because of his father.
- [UNCLEAR] problem

21:48.853 --> 21:55.056
Now, hold your breath. Now asthma - hold
your breath. Saakshat Jagdamba,

21:55.056 --> 21:58.651
Aham saakshat Jagdamba, Aham saakshat
Jagdamba, Aham saakshat Jagdamba,

21:58.651 --> 22:02.444
Aham saakshat Jagdamba, Aham saakshat
Jagdamba, saakshat Jagdamba,

22:02.444 --> 22:05.856
Aham saakshat Jagdamba, Aham saakshat
Jagdamba. Haan done.

22:05.856 --> 22:09.813
Now, hold your, now, for asthma
best thing is

22:09.813 --> 22:16.890
to put bracket Jagdamba and Shri Rama.
Aham saakshat Shri Ram Jagdamba,

22:16.890 --> 22:21.911
Aham saakshat Shri Ram Jagdamba,
Shri Ram Jagdamba, Aham saakshat

22:21.911 --> 22:26.467
or you can just say, Nirmal, Nirmal Shri.
Aham saakshat Nirmal Ram,

22:26.467 --> 22:33.862
Aham saakshat Nirmal Ram, Aham saakshat
Nirmal Ram, Aham saakshaat... cleaned out.

22:33.862 --> 22:38.159
- Are you alright? Breathing is alright now?
- Yes, Mother

22:38.668 --> 22:43.858
Just a, just a weak..... I'll stay, sit down.
Sit down that facing that side. It's gone out na?

22:44.043 --> 22:47.713
- Little bit. He's not feeling but it's here, haan
- Haan, that's it.

22:47.713 --> 22:52.409
Now, Aham saakshat Nirmal Mahaganesha,
Aham saakshat Nirmal Mahaganesha,

22:52.409 --> 22:56.111
Aham saakshat Nirmal Mahaganesha,
saakshat Nirmal Mahaganesha

22:56.111 --> 22:59.496
Aham saakshat Nirmal Mahaganesha,
Aham saakshat Nirmal Mahaganesha,

22:59.496 --> 23:02.628
saakshat Nirmal Mahaganesha,
Aham saakshat Nirmal Mahaganesha,

23:02.628 --> 23:07.607
Aham saakshat - done. Now you can say,
Aham saakshat Mokshdayini,

23:07.607 --> 23:12.285
Aham saakshat Mokshdayini, Aham saakshat
Mokshdayini, saakshat Mokshdayini,

23:12.285 --> 23:16.997
Aham saakshat Mokshdayini, Aham saakshat
Mokshdayini, Aham saakshat Mokshdayini

23:17.067 --> 23:23.157
for Me, even once it's alright to say but
you all should say seven times - understand?

23:23.157 --> 23:25.824
This is that, actually, where the
both void are catching

23:25.824 --> 23:28.272
-Annh?
- [UNCLEAR], yeah
- What's it?

23:28.272 --> 23:33.413
- both of them they, it's all gets matching
- Coming from there? Unnh, so put it down

23:33.413 --> 23:38.550
That's the way to Mahakali. This is
Mahakali's mantra - Aham saakshat Mahakali

23:40.124 --> 23:44.954
Aham saakshat Mahakali, Aham
saakshat Mahakali

23:53.224 --> 23:55.084
but you've got

24:04.426 --> 24:09.576
Mahakali to idhar bhi aana chahiye.
[UNCLEAR] left mein, left mein hai - sorry

24:09.576 --> 24:15.193
Aham saakshat Mahakali. [UNCLEAR]
Inko liver bhi hai. He has both the sides.

24:15.193 --> 24:17.860
- Haan, that is true
- That's why..

24:17.860 --> 24:22.962
He's a staunch religious person from the
childhood and he has picked up all wrong gurus.

24:22.962 --> 24:28.818
- Who? But now he has got the right one
- So - yeah - it needs

24:28.818 --> 24:30.907
- I'll do it [UNCLEAR]
- needs a clearing

24:30.907 --> 24:32.759
- [UNCLEAR]
- It breaks this candle

24:32.759 --> 24:36.420
- Yes, it's alright, it's [UNCLEAR] in Sahaja treatment
- Achcha

24:38.644 --> 24:42.214
My nephew has just gone to Dublin,
to school, Mother.

24:42.214 --> 24:43.799
- Who?
- My nephew

24:43.799 --> 24:45.960
- Where?
- At [UNCLEAR] school

24:46.017 --> 24:51.517
- Oh! Columbas, Saint Columbas. Is a boarder?
- Boarder

24:52.333 --> 24:56.533
- He has two sons?
- My cousin sister. The one who is a dentist,

24:56.533 --> 25:06.545
- who came and shown his steel.
- Now, now let's give him his thing down -

25:06.545 --> 25:10.286
alright, so what we'll do is to - Aham
saakshat Mahakali, Aham saaksha.. you see,

25:10.286 --> 25:16.862
because of My, I don't have to worry so
much right, left, center - that's how

25:21.188 --> 25:29.138
My! [IN HINDI - Now it has stopped
on Swadhishthan]

25:37.421 --> 25:43.441
- Left Swadhisthan, I think, get it all the heat
- Actually, he's catching from his father

25:43.441 --> 25:48.160
because his father has a heart, you see so
he's indicating it. If father has a heart,

25:48.160 --> 25:52.318
the child gets this because the father's
side, na, father's side. Haan!

25:52.430 --> 25:54.170
- Much better
- Hmm

25:54.170 --> 25:56.927
Actually, it's his [UNCLEAR - MENU?] as
the Left Swadhishthan is sucking it all up

25:56.927 --> 25:58.854
- Unnh?
- The left Swadhishthan is sucking it all out

25:58.854 --> 26:00.461
- Hmm
- All over

26:00.461 --> 26:03.179
[IN HINDI - That's why we must keep
on Left Swadhishthan]

26:05.292 --> 26:10.061
Give it a bandhan but keep for a while
- light. Keep it in such a way,

26:10.061 --> 26:12.936
even if you don't have, you can
keep the photograph.

26:16.635 --> 26:19.565
- It's coming out
- [UNCLEAR]

26:25.233 --> 26:28.173
It's better to have it there
than to have it.

26:54.870 --> 27:00.350
- [IN HINDI - The candle is small]
- [IN HINDI - We should ground it, Shri Mataji]

27:00.350 --> 27:12.323
- Annh? [IN HINDI - I have grounded it]
[UNCLEAR]

27:24.758 --> 27:29.248
So all the permutations and combinations
of left side, it was tied up.

27:29.463 --> 27:34.853
[IN HINDI - Achcha, Left side is simple.]
First of all, any left side - right to the left.

27:36.421 --> 27:44.161
Then, you have to see, if it is Swadhishthana;
Work out for it but Muladhara combination

27:44.161 --> 27:49.988
is the worst of all - like Multiple Sclerosis
in Muladhara. The lady was sitting,

27:50.349 --> 27:57.799
I just lit the candle and there was a
little gap in her shin, but she

27:57.799 --> 28:01.527
couldn't lift her legs, you see and I
gave her bandhan thrice to her Muladhara

28:01.527 --> 28:06.982
and she lifted her both the legs. Can you
imagine? She lifted her both the legs.

28:08.008 --> 28:15.978
- Multiple Sclerosis.
- Left is very subtle because it will shift

28:15.978 --> 28:18.640
- around the body
- No, but easier. Because of this,

28:18.640 --> 28:22.682
fire is the best for it. [IN HINDI - Let
them use the fire.] Fire is the best.

28:22.682 --> 28:25.466
[IN HINDI - It comes out so easily
in the fire] Haan!

28:26.674 --> 28:30.054
- Clearing out
- [UNCLEAR]

28:41.658 --> 28:45.948
Where I was working in this mental hospital,
he used to be very upset because I used to

28:45.948 --> 28:49.862
burn a diva in front of the photograph.
Three or four times they tried to stop me

28:49.862 --> 28:52.609
- but they didn't [UNCLEAR]
- That's the problem.

28:53.594 --> 29:00.404
[UNCLEAR] is really a child, Terrence's child,
had some sort of a big [UNCLEAR] because

29:00.404 --> 29:06.635
Terrence went there - naturally. If Terrence
moves [UNCLEAR] and you see, she went

29:06.635 --> 29:09.488
with her all things and said, "You have to
put Mother's photograph and everything,"

29:09.488 --> 29:14.280
they refused. The doctors refused to
put it there. [UNCLEAR] I mean.

29:14.280 --> 29:19.090
They said, "You see, it might be contaminated
or this and that and all that and see, I think,

29:19.090 --> 29:21.946
- you better [UNCLEAR].
- Which hospital? Breach Candy?

29:21.946 --> 29:23.155
- Breach Candy
- Then naturally

29:23.155 --> 29:25.702
- Stupid
- [UNCLEAR]

29:25.702 --> 29:31.330
But one nurse in that Breach Candy knows
about it and she sent so many patients to Me.

29:33.597 --> 29:39.517
Are you alright now? How are you feeling?
Light? Just see, if [UNCLEAR] this

29:39.517 --> 29:45.031
- coming out of your head? In front
- No, I'm cleared out.

29:48.276 --> 29:50.146
- Not good
- Is it?

29:50.157 --> 29:54.427
- I cannot tell it, it's not yet specific.
- Haan, coming surely.

29:57.176 --> 30:02.176
Coming but this he had a tall lesion
of blood like that [UNCLEAR]

30:07.497 --> 30:10.257
- Ekadasha
- hmm

30:15.036 --> 30:24.286
- Annh, it's opening out.
- It's opened

30:27.392 --> 30:30.052
Turn around this side.

30:36.765 --> 30:39.385
Better.

30:41.558 --> 30:48.038
- But in his case the right side is weak.
- He has liver also, his liver also

30:48.038 --> 30:52.614
[IN HINDI - Gujarati people have a lot of liver
problem because they eat farsand etc too much]

30:52.614 --> 30:53.854
- [IN HINDI - They should reduce that]
- [IN HINDI - Even Oil]

30:53.854 --> 30:57.524
[IN HINDI - Yes, their food is very oily and secondly the other thing is that],

30:57.524 --> 31:03.679
apart from oily, they think too much. Even
the women, I've seen, they think and plan,

31:03.679 --> 31:06.715
[IN HINDI - "Today we'll make this
food, today we'll do this."]

31:06.715 --> 31:09.599
Everyday, see they are busy
with thinking too much.

31:09.636 --> 31:15.266
[IN HINDI - Their liver gets spoilt soon like this]
and thirdly, I think, this [IN HINDI - [UNCLEAR] oil] .

31:15.266 --> 31:17.589
- That's the worst of all
- Which?

31:17.589 --> 31:19.246
- [UNCLEAR]
- [UNCLEAR]

31:19.246 --> 31:20.771
- What's that?
- Peanut oil.

31:20.771 --> 31:23.135
- Achcha.
- That's the worst thing because that

31:23.135 --> 31:27.713
gives you Leucoderma also. [IN HINDI - That's
why, you see, Gujaratis have a lot of Leucoderma.]

31:27.713 --> 31:32.653
You know that disease of leucoderma - that
is because of this [IN HINDI - [UNCLEAR] oil].

31:32.653 --> 31:39.472
Absolutely, it is the worst, is peanut seed
oil. We never had peanuts in India, you see.

31:39.472 --> 31:42.768
- There's no word for peanuts in Sanskrit language.
- [IN HINDI - No]

31:42.768 --> 31:46.031
- It came from, I think, from the [UNCLEAR]
- Arabs, probably

31:46.031 --> 31:48.230
- Annh?
- The Arabs
- Maybe Arabs

31:48.820 --> 31:51.529
This son was born in Dublin

31:51.529 --> 31:53.096
- Where?
- In Dublin

31:53.096 --> 31:56.586
- [UNCLEAR]
- Achcha!
- This in India

31:56.586 --> 32:02.086
- India. That's no difference.
- Nice

32:02.086 --> 32:05.725
But [IN HINDI - there is some], still what
is the month he was born?

32:05.725 --> 32:07.669
- February
- What date?

32:07.669 --> 32:10.623
- 28th February, Pisces
- Pisces

32:10.623 --> 32:13.125
- Pisces
- Pisces [IN HINDI - Is the new beginning]

32:13.125 --> 32:18.129
- [UNCLEAR] It's like more the first month
- First month, first [UNCLEAR]

32:18.129 --> 32:22.430
Aquarius and Pisces, is very good for him.
When was he born?

32:22.430 --> 32:25.054
- 31st of March
- Aries

32:25.054 --> 32:27.204
- Hmm, Aries
- Aries, Pisces

32:27.204 --> 32:30.238
- [UNCLEAR]
- You are Aries, Mother?

32:30.238 --> 32:34.022
I don't know. They say, I've born at zero
point because 21st March

32:34.022 --> 32:36.141
and at 12 0'clock in the daytime
I was born.

32:36.141 --> 32:37.869
- I have done Your horoscope, Shri Mataji
- Achcha!

32:37.869 --> 32:41.323
- as calendar. It is
- most interesting, just takes lovely shape

32:41.323 --> 32:44.593
- I cannot describe it to You
- Very regular

32:44.593 --> 32:47.296
- Everything is so balanced
- Very powerful, very solid!

32:47.296 --> 32:51.402
- You cannot describe it [UNCLEAR]
- That's what he said also. Choudhary,

32:51.402 --> 32:53.609
- who did it in India, said,
- Yes, very interesting!

32:53.609 --> 32:58.066
"It is most balanced thing because the
center of India, center of this and all that."

32:58.066 --> 33:02.872
Has to be, I've to be balanced also. When
I have to balance the whole world, I have

33:02.872 --> 33:07.141
to be balanced Myself. But the way it is
been assumed, you see, because, you see

33:07.141 --> 33:11.747
others were born, all of them, at a point
where there was some sort of an imbalance

33:11.747 --> 33:15.479
and they came to balance it for a thing
but Mine is at a balance point

33:15.479 --> 33:17.031
to balance the whole world.

33:17.623 --> 33:23.013
But it is not in - the horoscope it is impossible
to analyze it because everything is so

33:23.013 --> 33:28.774
interrelated, that if you try and analyze
it, you will be going, I mean, [UNCLEAR]

33:28.774 --> 33:33.712
just something that is negative
- is that [UNCLEAR]

33:37.296 --> 33:41.986
Good. Are they alright now? Good!
Let's see doctor saab.

33:42.215 --> 33:44.375
- [IN HINDI - Come]
- [UNCLEAR]

33:46.300 --> 33:51.500
[IN HINDI - Here] Gujaratis are doing nothing for
Sahaja yog. You see, Flash - there's the one

33:51.500 --> 33:57.167
who have Flash magazine. They published so
much thing about Sahaja yog and all that - nobody.

33:57.478 --> 34:01.682
- This Gujaratis don't want it.
- I wish Mother, I could come only in London.

34:01.682 --> 34:06.617
I was just telling him in the planes. This
year we're going to combine me and this one

34:06.617 --> 34:12.230
and I said to him, "We haven't bought the
house in Dublin let's buy or live in London.

34:12.230 --> 34:17.634
At least I'll see people, our people and
do something." Dublin is very isolated,

34:17.634 --> 34:20.580
- very gloomy [UNCLEAR].
- Nai but now you've done a job in Dublin,

34:20.580 --> 34:23.008
that's good. You establish it well
when you come out.

34:23.008 --> 34:27.235
Jogian is the one You should give full
credit to, I am not.

34:28.418 --> 34:32.868
The way he met them but I really
- remarkable. The way you met these boys.

34:32.868 --> 34:37.832
- Where did you meet them? In the...
- Arre! This side is [UNCLEAR]

34:37.832 --> 34:42.177
No, the funniest part is that [UNCLEAR - DOUG?]
funny one man, brought me to the meeting.

34:43.595 --> 34:49.975
- And how did he bring?
- You know, he isn't admitting, even in this

34:49.975 --> 34:54.089
- Any guru comes, that good guru
- So he said, "Why don't you now he's [UNCLEAR]?

34:54.089 --> 34:59.355
I said, "No, I don't want to." "Go, Go,"
so I said, "Okay, I'll go," and I said and

34:59.717 --> 35:04.737
[UNCLEAR] grandson called, "We'll be
there." So I said, "I'd like to meet Paul."

35:04.737 --> 35:08.204
- So, I started talking to Paul and Paul said
- Who spoke there?

35:08.648 --> 35:13.558
John but I didn't even hear the talk,
Mother. I know, I heard, all I heard was

35:13.558 --> 35:16.882
the [UNCLEAR] said, "Sit down, put your
hands towards Me. Did you feel anything?"

35:16.882 --> 35:19.437
- Really!
- The first my, I must think but when I

35:19.437 --> 35:22.125
went home, that night I got up at
3 in the morning

35:22.125 --> 35:25.235
and I was up because my hands,
my feet and my head

35:25.235 --> 35:30.513
were just hot. I mean, I was sweating
there and then and I couldn't sleep, I was

35:30.513 --> 35:36.276
just sweating and that was on the next
day, I went to the meeting and I said,

35:36.276 --> 35:40.694
"Can I see Paul on his own on Fridays?" So
he said, "Yes, come along," and I spent

35:40.694 --> 35:45.209
the whole day with him and still I was - I
didn't want to give up the false one and

35:45.209 --> 35:49.151
I said, "No, but this not, " so Paul just
said, "Listen, listen but this is at least

35:49.151 --> 35:53.684
- Mahishasur, he's very bad, give him up."
- Then he came to the center.

35:53.684 --> 35:58.053
Then, that Saturday he came and I was going
to decide, it was too much. I mean, then I

35:58.053 --> 36:03.119
suddenly, end began to dawn, I began to
realize what's happening. In my realization

36:03.119 --> 36:07.886
- I got materially vibration in a way - let's see.
- And one day the whole house became

36:07.886 --> 36:12.703
- And one day the whole house was clean.
- In our own house they came and [UNCLEAR]

36:12.703 --> 36:16.144
- But it was [UNCLEAR]
- [UNCLEAR] a great seeker, you see.

36:16.144 --> 36:21.079
Normally it's difficult to dissuade
[UNCLEAR] from this horrible fellow.

36:21.079 --> 36:27.083
[UNCLEAR] the law is very good. They won't
let me to sleep in our room. Coles put

36:27.083 --> 36:32.029
kumkum, swastika, almost everything. I
said, "I'll be okay, " so they gave me

36:32.029 --> 36:39.063
Your Parvati's, na, haan, Parvati's
photograph of Mataji [UNCLEAR]

36:39.063 --> 36:44.741
and I then telephoned to them to
stay where [UNCLEAR]

36:44.741 --> 36:49.751
but then they spent a couple of more
days and the whole house was different,

36:49.751 --> 36:52.719
- totally different.
- There was no dirt in my house, there was no dust

36:52.719 --> 36:56.041
- Mother, you feel that
- Every time we had Mahishasur's photograph,
there used to be dust, dust,

36:56.041 --> 36:59.179
- Like somebody has put vacuum
all over. You know, you
- Like marks

36:59.179 --> 37:04.359
- I said, we took a lot out but some
- Your Mother's job is that, na. Her name is that

37:04.359 --> 37:12.042
[LAUGHTER] I'm a vacuum cleaner, a very
big one, you know na? That's true but,

37:12.042 --> 37:18.363
you see this, you must have been influenced
also by them, you see. You see, because

37:18.363 --> 37:23.717
they are English people, they know so much
about your culture. Also it's not possible,

37:23.717 --> 37:28.073
if you're not realized, you can't talk to
them anything about anything. If there are

37:28.073 --> 37:32.159
Indians, you can't talk to them about
Christ, if they are English, you can't

37:32.159 --> 37:37.399
talk to them about Ganesha - it's like that.
It's such a barrier but after realization,

37:37.399 --> 37:41.913
you see, how homogenous these all thing
works out, how they understand this and

37:41.913 --> 37:48.265
very sweet children, you know. You can see
from their life how [UNCLEAR] sweet
and balanced they are.

37:48.265 --> 37:51.482
This [NAME UNCLEAR] he must have told
you, he was a punkrop.

37:52.123 --> 37:55.323
- He himself told us.
- He told us every [UNCLEAR]

37:55.323 --> 38:01.308
You see, everyone had different time chat with
me. We cooked, I cooked, we ate and we go out.

38:01.308 --> 38:05.497
At 12 0'clock after the episode with
[UNCLEAR] we went to the mountains -

38:05.497 --> 38:09.671
- moon and mountains and we sat.
- We saw [UNCLEAR] from Dublin Sun rising out [UNCLEAR]

38:09.671 --> 38:14.815
You know we did everything and I talked each
boy different time and they all told us.

38:14.815 --> 38:19.458
- Allan was great he told [UNCLEAR]
- Because Allan [UNCLEAR] told, on certain

38:19.458 --> 38:27.001
terms that who You are and he told who Mahishasur, that baba is Mahishasur and

38:27.001 --> 38:31.469
- and Doug couldn't of course commit
this, so Carl just
- Like that

38:31.469 --> 38:37.327
He only, he's this, you don't do this, I want
this, he [UNCLEAR] do this and all that and

38:37.327 --> 38:41.184
- Douglas couldn't take it, he couldn't take it.
- Allan and [UNCLEAR]

38:41.184 --> 38:44.040
[UNCLEAR] he was shaking, you know.
She never saw

38:44.040 --> 38:47.866
[UNCLEAR] he couldn't, he just couldn't
talk, he just, "But, but, but, but,"

38:47.866 --> 38:52.027
that's like a - but, but, but - but, but

38:52.027 --> 38:57.610
but almost he, he can't, he came inside
the house this Sunday but [UNCLEAR]

38:57.610 --> 39:04.880
and he, "We Bible, I Bible, " he asked me, "Can I?"
but he put such a void back into the house but

39:04.880 --> 39:08.871
I didn't know what to answer [UNCLEAR]
away. I put water, I explained to her

39:08.871 --> 39:12.819
water yesterday but still her void is bad.
Everyday I come home from college

39:12.819 --> 39:17.240
and I watch the [UNCLEAR - TICKS?] in the air, so
everyday I [UNCLEAR], I pat my hands, I start

39:17.240 --> 39:23.460
[UNCLEAR] just a little [UNCLEAR] and
slept away but didn't go [UNCLEAR]

39:23.460 --> 39:33.105
But he doesn't know our agent [LAUGHTER]
that's it! That's the way to speak for that. Age 61,

39:33.105 --> 39:39.356
when you are that age, then you are doctor,
then you are psychologist and you believe in God

39:39.356 --> 39:44.403
but you believe in this Mahishasur, that
doesn't mean everyone has to follow and

39:44.403 --> 39:51.086
question answer you did with this another
doctor, who is not his age but he should

39:51.086 --> 39:54.202
- acted his age
- Then, you should tell him really -

39:54.202 --> 39:59.500
best thing would be that it is that is how we
see everybody, that everybody is an angel

39:59.500 --> 40:04.165
but this is something new. You see, it's
like guru shopping going on, you see.

40:04.165 --> 40:07.949
You go to this shop and that shop but
this is a temple where you enter.

40:08.589 --> 40:15.259
This is a temple, you tell him. You see,
now they have started another type of a

40:15.259 --> 40:19.271
propoganda. Sometimes they say, "She doesn't
need any money," but why do you need money?

40:19.271 --> 40:24.906
What do these people need money - parasites.
Money is not the point, it's not a point.

40:24.906 --> 40:28.884
Actually it's much deeper than that.
Money, of course they are naturally

40:28.884 --> 40:32.270
because they are so base and gross
that they are interested in your money

40:32.270 --> 40:38.544
in all these nonsensical things - that is
obvious but the worst thing that they do,

40:38.544 --> 40:43.939
is to make you so much debased that you
are possessed, you see. You are possessed

40:43.939 --> 40:49.815
- I mean then, what is your situation?
- They took our 500 at the moment and

40:49.815 --> 40:51.580
- Really!
- took lots of money.

40:51.580 --> 40:57.789
We put that money to buy this house, which
I so much regret ever, having been suggested.

40:58.330 --> 41:02.578
I only said to him but we didn't said, we
said to him, "Listen, you want to give yoga,

41:02.578 --> 41:07.435
we don't want to have. If we buy the house,
we'll make into Sahaja yoga center and we'll

41:07.435 --> 41:12.993
trouble you." So no he said that, so he
said, "We'll send some," and nothing happened

41:12.993 --> 41:17.209
and lawyer said, "O, if we give you five
hundred pounds back [UNCLEAR],"

41:17.209 --> 41:21.356
so I said, I told [UNCLEAR] that, "I want
all of our money back. None of that should

41:21.356 --> 41:26.213
belong to anybody, we lost, we got working,
we deserve that money," so the lawyer said,

41:26.213 --> 41:31.429
"Coming back in an hour," and he said,
"We'll give you back 1500," so I said,

41:31.429 --> 41:39.965
"Still not up to the point but I want
back." So, next day okay 2500 and I said,

41:39.965 --> 41:44.101
"Okay, I'll settle it up, okay." Then he
comes to the house and he says,

41:44.101 --> 41:48.101
"Oh, it goes off to me, I give you a check
of all the money," but the lawyer said that,

41:48.101 --> 41:52.244
"We can't give you it all back because
it is not customary." My father said

41:52.244 --> 41:55.322
- It is not what - custom?
- It's not customary. The lawyer said,

41:55.322 --> 41:59.370
"It's in your interest to keep it," so
Douglas and I had to keep it and I had to,

41:59.370 --> 42:03.960
kind of, say no, so my father said, "But
if that would be the case John." He said,

42:03.960 --> 42:08.629
"Yes," to the lawyer but, "You give me 3000
pounds in May or come to the house and give it."

42:08.629 --> 42:13.707
- So he just said, "Oh, but this and that,"
- But, why, why did you give this money to him?

42:13.707 --> 42:21.946
You see, as I said, Mataji, that, that
man working in psychiatric or with this

42:21.946 --> 42:31.006
Mahishasur, with whom we visit every year,
he has this power to hypnotize or mesmerism
- something.

42:31.006 --> 42:37.761
When he says, you can't deny it. He says,
"If this is debt, good for you."

42:37.761 --> 42:41.289
When he wants it, otherwise he'll say,
"It's not, it's not good for you," because

42:41.289 --> 42:47.505
"It's sweet, it's bad for you." He has
taken over complete me and him.

42:47.505 --> 42:51.310
That's what, he's very certain - he's is,
he's is mind control. You come inside the

42:51.310 --> 42:55.617
room and he will pick up all the tension
that we belong to him and you're not

42:55.617 --> 43:00.670
coming back with it, so he's always at the
center with everything and you're little break then

43:00.670 --> 43:05.680
- So he asked for the money?
- Yeah, he said to buy the house and the way

43:05.680 --> 43:11.469
things are Jogian and my husband in, saw
at the moment say, "Yes, that's the best idea,

43:11.469 --> 43:16.013
we'll buy your house," which was the whole
house. Now he has divided half his he's going

43:16.013 --> 43:20.358
to build his surgeries that doesn't belong
to us. Half remain here, I'll work there,

43:20.358 --> 43:24.643
I'll live there as a ready made secretary,
who's smart, take the phone messages

43:24.643 --> 43:31.057
because phone is in their name, put Dr. Thakur's
name out because he's doctor and his practice

43:31.057 --> 43:35.325
- he will loose although he lives somewhere else.
- Annh! [UNCLEAR]

43:35.325 --> 43:41.663
He has worked out planned out from last
Christmas and then he put us all in like that, so

43:41.663 --> 43:46.885
I paid in July before going to Saudi. From London,
I went back to Dublin to sign the contract.

43:47.255 --> 43:52.445
Then from Saudi master rang to say,
"We don't want house, please discuss."

43:52.445 --> 43:56.596
"Oh, yes, yes." When I came back, he
said, "No, no, no keep the house."

43:56.596 --> 43:58.569
He told Jogian, "Don't move
out of the house.

43:58.569 --> 44:02.493
Stay with your mother. She needs you
and she'll save the money that way."

44:02.493 --> 44:06.525
One day, "Move out," next day, "Don't move
out." One day, "Do this, don't do that."

44:06.525 --> 44:11.580
- You see, I want some [UNCLEAR]
- Then he's so low Mataji that influence on

44:11.580 --> 44:17.204
Jogian, he said, "Dhatt!" Those things started
to happen and then Sahaja yoga came to Dublin.

44:17.204 --> 44:22.818
He said in front of Jogin, "Well, buy the house."
I said, "We can't afford, we don't want to."

44:22.818 --> 44:28.496
He said, "Give me your car." "I can't, I don't
want to." "Okay, you have insurance, haven't you?"

44:28.496 --> 44:33.613
and I said, "Why?" He said, "If anything
happens to him, you can get the insurance

44:33.613 --> 44:37.716
money and you'll be okay." See,
the mentality of the man!

44:37.716 --> 44:42.625
- It's disgusting!
- [UNCLEAR] A Gujarati woman that I am born,

44:42.625 --> 44:48.216
to tell me that, I mean, I said, "No way,
please leave. I don't want to talk about it."

44:48.216 --> 44:54.107
But I couldn't say okay leave, when Jogin
said to get out. I couldn't bring out but

44:54.107 --> 44:59.169
I have nothing to do with the man, who goes that
down, "Okay, if anything happens, you have insurance."

45:00.506 --> 45:06.146
It's just, he's an embodiment of evil,
he's an evil disciple, just evil [UNCLEAR]

45:06.146 --> 45:08.804
I mean, just imagine, how could
he suggest such a thing!

45:09.179 --> 45:15.069
- What's worse, he's a psychiatrist and a doctor.
- He's doing to people, weak people,

45:15.374 --> 45:19.244
- who lean upon him.
- I mean, he doesn't understand even,

45:19.244 --> 45:22.365
really the, he's not an Indian at all
to talk like this.

45:31.290 --> 45:37.150
- You'll be alright.
- Left, Vishuddhi is [UNCLEAR]

45:37.367 --> 45:44.837
Left. So just now you'll be in the same
house or what are you doing?

45:44.837 --> 45:51.469
No, we have rented the house. From 16th of
September we have moved in that rented house

45:52.551 --> 45:59.451
Rented house but we don't know Mataji. Yes,
we will be. This fellow is in medicine, third year.

45:59.451 --> 46:04.285
- Where was he in medicine?
- Yes, Trinity College and this...
