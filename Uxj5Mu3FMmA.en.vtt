WEBVTT

00:02.800 --> 00:07.280
And first you have this background, that they are seekers,

00:07.480 --> 00:09.080
they are misled,

00:09.400 --> 00:11.200
they are your brothers and sisters,

00:11.400 --> 00:16.040
and they are been really taken into

00:16.280 --> 00:18.200
the clutches of negativity.

00:18.440 --> 00:20.440
You have to move very, very carefully about it,

00:20.640 --> 00:22.320
really careful.

00:22.600 --> 00:25.880
First of all they must feel your love and concern.

00:27.000 --> 00:28.760
That is very important.

00:28.960 --> 00:32.240
So instead losing temper with them or getting angry with them

00:34.760 --> 00:36.760
you should really have

00:37.880 --> 00:39.680
compassion,

00:40.600 --> 00:42.840
because they are so unfortunate.

00:44.280 --> 00:46.080
They are so unfortunate.

00:46.360 --> 00:48.880
Those who are not coming to Sahaja Yoga and are going the wrong way;

00:49.080 --> 00:51.720
are so unfortunate people, they are lost people.

00:54.200 --> 00:57.560
Whatever they may say, but they are lost,

00:58.400 --> 01:00.000
and you know that.

01:01.040 --> 01:02.880
They are lost people.

01:04.640 --> 01:06.000
And with

01:09.400 --> 01:11.920
this myth that they are living,

01:12.240 --> 01:15.160
they are going towards hell, actually.

01:15.760 --> 01:20.360
And they have lost all chances for Realization if they don’t understand Sahaja Yoga, see?

01:21.760 --> 01:24.000
You have to talk to them like that,

01:24.200 --> 01:27.880
that, “How do you recognize him as your guru?

01:28.080 --> 01:29.880
What has he done for you?

01:30.080 --> 01:32.120
What powers has he given you?

01:32.640 --> 01:34.880
You can be your own guru”.

01:36.080 --> 01:38.360
Don’t start talking about Me, first of all.

01:38.560 --> 01:39.720
No, not much.

01:39.960 --> 01:43.480
You should say, “She does nothing. She just makes us our own guru,

01:43.680 --> 01:48.120
and we know what is our problem is, we know your problem. You can work it out.

01:48.400 --> 01:50.640
That’s not difficult.

01:55.000 --> 01:58.320
But after all, if you are seekers,

01:58.520 --> 02:00.520
what have you found out so far?”

02:00.720 --> 02:01.920
I mean,

02:03.440 --> 02:06.360
if you, there’s somebody who has been guiding,

02:06.560 --> 02:09.600
you must see what he has done to others.

02:09.800 --> 02:12.760
They might talk, they might say, “Oh, we have found the way, we have done”

02:12.960 --> 02:14.560
But what way?

02:14.920 --> 02:16.920
One thing one must ask:

02:17.160 --> 02:21.760
“What have we got in our own awareness, in human awareness, what have we got?”

02:24.480 --> 02:26.560
“What have we achieved?”

02:31.920 --> 02:34.200
And that is how you will know,

02:34.400 --> 02:37.560
because, you see, you are not manifesting your own powers.

02:37.760 --> 02:40.760
You may be talking what guru says, what is written in that book.

02:40.960 --> 02:43.080
Anybody can do it , what’s so great?

02:44.200 --> 02:46.440
You are not manifesting your powers at all.

02:46.640 --> 02:49.640
You have no powers of any kind, you are weak people.

02:50.280 --> 02:53.520
It’s just a mass nonsense going on

02:54.440 --> 02:58.600
that, people just follow somebody and another one follows, another one follows,

02:58.800 --> 03:03.160
but one doesn’t see that what’s happening is everybody is running.

03:06.520 --> 03:08.440
See, one doesn’t want to wait and see,

03:08.640 --> 03:11.040
“Where are we? What are our moorings?”

03:11.240 --> 03:13.320
You see. you must find out.

03:14.080 --> 03:16.640
We must fathom out ourselves.

03:17.240 --> 03:20.760
And you say you are feeling better; this may be ego pampering.

03:20.960 --> 03:24.240
That’s not the thing. What has happened to your awareness is the point.

03:24.440 --> 03:28.120
Can you judge others? Can you judge yourself on absolute points?

03:28.320 --> 03:30.960
If you are at absolute points, and you judge

03:31.160 --> 03:33.400
and supposing you say you judge like this,

03:33.600 --> 03:36.640
are you sure that the other one will judge the same way?

03:39.440 --> 03:44.880
You see, when you put a direct question like this, then they will answer.

03:45.080 --> 03:49.000
You say, “You don’t try to deceive yourself we deceived ourselves in the same way.”

03:49.200 --> 03:51.520
If you start on this that,

03:51.720 --> 03:55.240
“We were like this, we were misled, we did all these mistakes”,

03:55.440 --> 03:57.120
then they’ll understand.

03:57.640 --> 04:01.600
Some of you should say that, “We went to drug side, you see, the left sided,

04:01.800 --> 04:05.200
into hypnosis. It was hypnosis, first we didn’t know it was hypnosis.

04:05.400 --> 04:07.120
We were hypnotized.

04:07.320 --> 04:11.800
We did not know, you see, we were so much enamored by their way, outward behavior

04:12.000 --> 04:15.480
and this and that, that we never understood that it was hypnosis.”

04:15.680 --> 04:18.160
But logically also you must understand,

04:19.120 --> 04:21.880
that if we have organized ourselves as something,

04:22.080 --> 04:25.040
are we really meaning it or it is another artificial thing,

04:25.240 --> 04:28.920
just like a church or just like any other, other organization?

04:29.120 --> 04:32.960
It’s not God’s organization. If so, do you understand?

04:38.720 --> 04:42.040
And then with Sahaja Yoga you should say that,

04:42.760 --> 04:46.160
“We can feel your Kundalini, we can feel our Kundalini,

04:46.360 --> 04:48.680
we know our chakras, we know your chakras - we can feel it.

04:48.880 --> 04:51.480
Even the children can feel it if they are realized souls.

04:51.680 --> 04:54.160
We speak the same language.

04:54.360 --> 04:58.960
We raise the Kundalini of others, by which we have cured people

04:59.160 --> 05:02.880
of cancer, of many diseases, mental diseases, emotional diseases.

05:03.120 --> 05:04.720
Can you do it?”

05:04.920 --> 05:09.880
You should say: “You have no knowledge of the technique of God”.

05:11.400 --> 05:14.240
Technique of Divine is different from our technique.

05:14.440 --> 05:20.080
Just by sitting, standing, jumping, shouting, that’s not a technique.

05:21.560 --> 05:25.760
The technique is that you should know where we are moving.

05:27.640 --> 05:30.400
Then you can say about right sided people also that you say,

05:30.600 --> 05:34.480
“We are God world government and an incarnation is born.”

05:34.680 --> 05:37.120
“Where is he? He is dead now.

05:37.320 --> 05:40.600
Who are you? Nothing, except that you have little money with you.

05:40.800 --> 05:43.400
There are many people who have money

05:47.280 --> 05:50.080
But organizing dead is not the way to organize.

05:50.280 --> 05:52.600
You are deceiving yourself,

05:53.080 --> 05:55.120
by this kind of a nonsensical talk.

05:55.320 --> 05:59.520
This is all nonsensical, is all written down, in the scriptures.

05:59.720 --> 06:02.600
If you know how to read the scriptures,

06:02.800 --> 06:05.320
you can just interpret it and put it whatever you like

06:05.640 --> 06:08.920
and if you know how assert and talk, you can write many books.

06:09.400 --> 06:11.120
It’s nothing great.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.840
But can you read your own book?

06:16.520 --> 06:19.080
Can you feel your own chakras?

06:19.280 --> 06:22.200
Can you read another person’s chakras?

06:23.560 --> 06:25.520
That’s the main thing.

06:28.040 --> 06:29.960
You should say, “Our guru doesn’t want any money.

06:30.160 --> 06:32.720
She is not even a guru, She is a Mother. She is so affectionate.

06:32.920 --> 06:34.800
She doesn’t take any money, She doesn’t do anything.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.960
On the contrary, as Bala has said, She gives us presents,

06:38.600 --> 06:40.600
She looks after us.”

06:45.280 --> 06:49.680
Sahaja Yogi: Mother, I was talking to one gentleman. He is not Sahaja Yogi,

06:50.120 --> 06:53.880
but he is very well known in the Brighton area,

06:54.080 --> 06:58.080
and I said to him, “How do you see Sahaja Yoga

06:58.280 --> 07:03.480
and how do other people who heard of Sahaja Yoga feel about it?”

07:03.800 --> 07:06.880
And it seems that we’re still staying as being -

07:07.200 --> 07:09.160
we are not very well known

07:09.360 --> 07:12.120
and people still see us as a cult, Mother,

07:12.320 --> 07:15.280
because, with all respect, Mother,

07:16.120 --> 07:19.960
when, when they see a picture of somebody

07:20.960 --> 07:22.640
with a name,

07:24.200 --> 07:28.880
immediately the response is, “It’s just another organization, it’s a cult.”

07:29.080 --> 07:32.960
Shri Mataji: Why? I mean My photo, this picture doesn’t look like that, does it?

07:33.160 --> 07:34.640
Sahaja Yogi: No, Ma.

07:35.880 --> 07:38.360
Shri Mataji: You should put this picture on.

07:38.840 --> 07:41.560
I mean, you see, there is a difference, you must talk to them,

07:41.760 --> 07:45.400
“It’s not a cult, because we have no organization, we have no membership,

07:45.640 --> 07:48.280
we don’t pay anything firstly.

07:48.520 --> 07:51.480
Then we, we all are

07:51.720 --> 07:56.520
people who are aware of a new dimension in our awareness.

07:56.920 --> 07:58.640
Even small children come.

07:58.840 --> 08:01.080
We know, they know.

08:02.720 --> 08:03.800
There is -

08:04.000 --> 08:06.240
cult is a thing which creates fanaticism.

08:06.440 --> 08:10.200
We have no fanaticism. We are open to all. All can come.”

08:10.440 --> 08:12.960
They have to take their Realization, is the main point.

08:13.160 --> 08:17.640
You see, our all attitude is absolutely subtle,

08:17.840 --> 08:19.800
and we should say very, very

08:21.440 --> 08:24.240
spiritual, because we say, “You must get your Realization”.

08:24.440 --> 08:27.920
We don’t say, “You must pay so much money.” You see?

08:28.120 --> 08:29.960
“You must get your Realization”.

08:30.160 --> 08:32.440
“Secondly, you see, you people talk

08:32.640 --> 08:37.720
of making sort of big funds and things for the growth”.

08:38.360 --> 08:39.360
All right?

08:39.560 --> 08:44.160
“But, we, we want the becoming.

08:45.760 --> 08:49.520
We want what becomes of you, that’s important.

08:49.760 --> 08:51.760
What becomes a person, what becomes of others.

08:52.160 --> 08:53.320
Becoming!

08:53.520 --> 08:55.200
So it’s a living thing.

08:55.400 --> 08:59.280
And living things cannot be cults, you see? It’s a living thing.

08:59.480 --> 09:03.600
What we want, you should get a new awareness in which you should grow,

09:03.840 --> 09:06.720
and you should become effective, you see?

09:07.440 --> 09:11.080
It’s not well known because we are not a cult.

09:13.040 --> 09:14.880
That’s the main reason.”

09:16.360 --> 09:19.040
Sahaja Yogi: Mother, these, these are gross people and

09:19.240 --> 09:22.840
they, the general feeling amongst them is that if it’s Indian it’s got to be a cult.

09:23.040 --> 09:23.600
Shri Mataji: Who?

09:23.800 --> 09:28.320
Sahaja Yogi: Because it’s Indian, you see? Because You, because You, You took Your birth in India

09:28.520 --> 09:31.800
Shri Mataji: What about the cults they are having in America and all over?

09:32.000 --> 09:35.040
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, well, they see the Maharishi and they see the orange guy

09:35.240 --> 09:38.400
and they just think: “Oh, it’s just another one!” It’s just the what they say.

09:38.600 --> 09:40.520
Shri Mataji: You see, you must talk about India.

09:40.720 --> 09:42.720
That India is the place which has the roots

09:42.920 --> 09:44.960
and we are  offshoots, no doubt about it.

09:45.160 --> 09:46.800
Sahaja Yogi: They don’t understand at what level they are.

09:47.000 --> 09:51.760
Shri Mataji: Yes, it is true. India is not all cult, is not all cult.

09:51.960 --> 09:55.360
There are real people and there are unreal people.

09:55.640 --> 09:58.600
And the unreal people are in the market.

09:58.800 --> 10:02.080
Mataji is not in the market, She is a temple in the market.

10:03.120 --> 10:04.560
This is the difference.

10:04.760 --> 10:08.520
She is not in the market, She is selling nothing.

10:09.360 --> 10:10.440
You see?

10:10.960 --> 10:14.960
But, she, the temple had to be established in the market

10:15.160 --> 10:18.200
because in the market people were looking in the name of God.

10:18.400 --> 10:21.960
So she is the only guru who has come,

10:23.240 --> 10:26.320
who is a real person, who is a realized person,

10:26.520 --> 10:29.480
who is not a cult person, but has come

10:29.680 --> 10:31.400
to the market

10:31.600 --> 10:33.400
and is the temple,

10:33.600 --> 10:35.840
which is a more difficult thing.

10:40.480 --> 10:45.360
And you can say, “We have seen, actually with our own eyes the Kundalini rising.

10:45.720 --> 10:48.120
We have seen people being cured of Sahaja Yoga,

10:48.320 --> 10:51.320
getting out of the hospitals, how are we not to believe in?”

10:51.520 --> 10:53.640
By Sahaja Yogis!

10:55.560 --> 10:58.720
Christine has cured one blood cancer now.

10:58.920 --> 11:00.920
They are very confident.

11:03.120 --> 11:05.680
Not that only I have cured,

11:06.360 --> 11:10.520
but Christine has cured now, Christine and What’s his name, another one?

11:13.040 --> 11:17.720
They, they have cured it, so you cannot just say -

11:18.440 --> 11:19.880
Herman.

11:23.160 --> 11:25.560
But you can also cure.

11:27.800 --> 11:28.840
“So this is not a cult.

11:29.040 --> 11:30.520
Our health has improved.

11:30.720 --> 11:34.240
We have given up all old habits, alcoholism automatically;

11:34.440 --> 11:38.160
we are saving money, about every way we are better off.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.760
In the cult this doesn’t happen,

11:42.960 --> 11:46.680
only you start behaving in a funny manner, everybody is becoming strange.

11:46.880 --> 11:49.440
We are very normal people, we are not strange. On the contrary

11:49.640 --> 11:52.360
we have drop out all our strangeness.

11:55.080 --> 11:57.400
Cult is a strange thing.”

11:57.680 --> 12:00.600
But if you walk anywhere you will not be called strange at all,

12:00.800 --> 12:03.160
on the contrary, you’ll be called very healthy and happy people.

12:03.360 --> 12:06.440
We went to one, one, one

12:08.200 --> 12:10.280
shop in Italy.

12:10.640 --> 12:13.040
The lady of a very big shop, you see?

12:13.600 --> 12:16.200
As soon as she saw, she said, “Ha, ha, come along.”

12:16.400 --> 12:18.360
Yes, she did not know what was happening to her.

12:18.560 --> 12:22.240
“Ha, please come in. Oh, come along. Very happy. Come along.”

12:22.440 --> 12:24.560
She didn’t know what has happening to her, you see,

12:24.760 --> 12:27.680
the way she was expressing herself, so funny.

12:29.640 --> 12:32.360
And then, in France this happened,

12:32.640 --> 12:35.720
and then we went to another shop.

12:35.960 --> 12:38.120
They said, “You people look so very happy,

12:38.320 --> 12:41.560
very happy, relaxed people. So who are you?”

12:43.560 --> 12:46.600
And one man who saw Me at the airport, you see,

12:46.800 --> 12:49.040
he was from Congo,

12:49.240 --> 12:51.560
and he just followed Me.

12:51.800 --> 12:55.440
There were three, four others who followed Me, and they came to the airport.

12:55.640 --> 12:58.360
We were sitting at the airport and

12:58.560 --> 13:03.440
he asked them - he is from the Ministry of Industries from Congo

13:03.720 --> 13:07.600
and he asked, “Who is this lady?” “She looks so serene

13:07.800 --> 13:09.920
and you people look so happy,

13:10.120 --> 13:11.560
what is all this going on?”

13:11.760 --> 13:16.600
And now, then he went to the ashram; now he is going to take it to Congo.

13:19.760 --> 13:22.440
So you must say, “Either you are seekers or you are not.

13:22.640 --> 13:25.400
If you are, you must seek it, as we have sought.

13:25.600 --> 13:29.000
We went through all these nonsensical things.

13:32.560 --> 13:35.680
We have just to come to tell you because you should not be lost.”

13:35.880 --> 13:36.920
Yes?

13:37.520 --> 13:40.680
Sahaja Yogi: I still see divine light people the other day, Mother,

13:40.880 --> 13:43.200
and I was talking to them

13:43.400 --> 13:45.880
about what You keep on saying about the experiences

13:46.080 --> 13:47.280
Shri Mataji: I can’t hear.

13:47.480 --> 13:48.800
Sahaja Yogi: I was talking to them, right.

13:49.000 --> 13:52.360
I’m trying to sort of getting them to come to the pavilion, right, and

13:54.440 --> 13:55.320
Sahaja Yogini: Speak of Richard, Mother.

13:55.560 --> 13:57.640
Sahaja Yogi:I was trying to expose the meeting, Mother.

13:57.840 --> 14:00.880
Shri Mataji: Yes, I know. Sahaja Yogi: And they said something like

14:01.080 --> 14:04.960
“Oh well, we’ve heard all these stories about how, you know,

14:05.160 --> 14:08.960
people have blockages in their chakras and they start to shake and that.

14:09.160 --> 14:11.720
How do you know what’s happening in all this sort of thing?”

14:11.920 --> 14:15.600
Could you give us some sort of good, rational

14:17.040 --> 14:19.200
counterarguments against that?

14:19.440 --> 14:24.160
Because they are so obviously into their guru that they think that theirs is right and

14:24.360 --> 14:27.200
if you feel pains in the chakras they said is because you’re all blocked

14:27.400 --> 14:29.080
and not them, you know?

14:29.280 --> 14:34.120
Shri Mataji: It’s very simple. You give yourself a bandhan and you can discriminate.

14:34.800 --> 14:38.680
If you just give yourself a bandhan then you can discriminate.

14:39.480 --> 14:42.960
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, but to that, to satisfy their minds, you know

14:43.720 --> 14:46.560
Shri Mataji: No, it should be clear-cut to you also, isn’t it?

14:46.760 --> 14:49.960
So, if you give yourself a bandhan, you can make it out.

14:50.160 --> 14:51.160
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.

14:52.080 --> 14:54.080
Shri Mataji: You can go and talk to them.

14:54.280 --> 14:56.280
You should say, “In any case, you come and listen to Mother;

14:56.480 --> 14:58.640
She’ll tell you if you have any problem.

14:58.840 --> 15:01.240
We may be not so good as yet, maybe.

15:01.440 --> 15:03.720
But we definitely feel.

15:03.920 --> 15:06.840
We have to still learn because we have to become

15:07.360 --> 15:09.520
and know all the technique.”

15:09.960 --> 15:12.640
So, that’s what you should accept a situation

15:12.880 --> 15:14.320
may be that we do not know.

15:14.560 --> 15:16.880
Just you give yourself a bandhan and you’ll know.

15:17.080 --> 15:20.920
And afterwards you don’t have to do that also, immediately you know

15:22.480 --> 15:25.520
what is yours and what is theirs.

15:31.080 --> 15:33.480
Why are you not going and talk to them?

15:35.080 --> 15:37.800
You take one or two people from here, again.

15:38.000 --> 15:42.120
Suburb and London people can go, senior people can go and say.

15:45.120 --> 15:48.440
Oh, but none of them have come here from

15:48.640 --> 15:50.520
Gavin, all these people, anybody.

15:50.720 --> 15:53.400
You can go and talk, all of you are quite senior that way.

15:53.600 --> 15:57.320
You can tell them that you can put yourself into chakras, you can fell it.

15:58.680 --> 15:59.360
All right?

15:59.560 --> 16:01.280
If there are three, four people then if one

16:01.480 --> 16:03.800
is too much, you see, because they are negative people.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.920
So they try to, sort of put you down.

16:06.120 --> 16:08.080
But if there is one person is like that,

16:08.240 --> 16:10.200
another person can stand up and say, “This is this.”

16:10.400 --> 16:12.880
Another can say, “This is this.”

16:13.080 --> 16:15.080
That’s how.

16:15.480 --> 16:18.200
But there should be no quarreling among Sahaja Yogis there.

16:19.680 --> 16:21.800
That’s important.

16:23.800 --> 16:25.960
Otherwise it would be ridiculous.

16:27.920 --> 16:31.240
But that’s how it will be, that you can make out.

16:35.960 --> 16:40.080
Sahaja Yogini: Mother, You also focus in Your attention on the front person, aren’t You?

16:40.280 --> 16:43.240
By putting the attention, and then if you catch

16:43.480 --> 16:45.240
Shri Mataji: Yes, that’s right.

16:45.440 --> 16:49.840
My attention is there on Brighton, no doubt, but what I’m saying that,

16:50.040 --> 16:52.880
you see, you are the channels now. You have to do the job.

16:53.080 --> 16:55.080
You see, I am the source but you have to be the channels.

16:55.280 --> 16:56.840
Channels have to be all right.

16:57.040 --> 16:59.080
Say for example ...

16:59.760 --> 17:00.920
Look at this.

17:01.120 --> 17:02.680
Truth is what you -[use]

17:02.880 --> 17:04.520
is your great

17:07.440 --> 17:08.600
Brighton.

17:11.600 --> 17:13.240
Mhmm, now better.

17:13.920 --> 17:15.520
Better now?

17:18.840 --> 17:20.640
Mhmm? How is it?

17:31.440 --> 17:33.680
And when they ask you such questions also, you should say,

17:33.880 --> 17:38.080
“But you can’t even see those blocks, anything; you cannot see anything.”

17:39.200 --> 17:41.440
You should say, “You have not even seen with your naked eyes

17:41.640 --> 17:44.440
the Kundalini rising, nothing. We have seen it!”

17:50.920 --> 17:53.600
At least you see you are progressing.

17:53.880 --> 17:56.120
“Maybe the knowledge may not be complete,

17:56.320 --> 17:58.960
but we are seeing that.

17:59.160 --> 18:03.160
It’s actualization, is not just talking, you know?”

18:05.520 --> 18:09.640
If you take three, four people is always better in an argument.

18:09.960 --> 18:13.600
You should say, “Look, you want to achieve it or not?

18:13.840 --> 18:16.120
You don’t have to pay anything.

18:16.600 --> 18:18.720
Nothing to be surrendered, nothing.

18:18.920 --> 18:21.360
Just you have to come and see for yourself.

18:22.320 --> 18:25.280
After all, what is She going to gain out of you?

18:25.880 --> 18:27.920
We have to gain out of Her.

18:28.120 --> 18:29.680
So why not?”

18:44.800 --> 18:45.920
Better.

18:49.440 --> 18:51.720
You have to tell them about the concern that you have.

18:51.920 --> 18:54.480
You should say that, “You are not going to get it.

18:54.760 --> 18:56.760
That’s not the way.

18:57.040 --> 19:00.720
You are not manifesting any of your powers.”

19:06.400 --> 19:08.120
If we are -

19:08.960 --> 19:12.240
technically all right, one person can be all right, technically

19:12.440 --> 19:14.840
who understands the technique, the divine technique

19:15.040 --> 19:19.160
another who can argue it out, another one who can talk about

19:21.560 --> 19:23.760
other gurus, and things like that, three, four people.

19:23.960 --> 19:27.440
You must all have a proper training center, I think for this.

19:27.640 --> 19:29.320
Sit down, talk, talk,

19:29.520 --> 19:31.560
find out how to propagate, how to talk.

19:31.760 --> 19:33.560
All these things you have to do.

19:33.760 --> 19:37.320
You see, like Warren has done that and it has worked out wonders.

19:37.520 --> 19:39.640
But you see, Warren himself got into it

19:39.800 --> 19:42.760
too much and he really learned it.

19:46.560 --> 19:47.640
Just go on into it,

19:47.840 --> 19:50.560
find out what is what, what is what, what is what.

19:54.800 --> 19:57.560
That’s how he can do it much better.

19:58.520 --> 20:03.000
Got all Sahaja yoga books, this, that, everything.

20:04.320 --> 20:07.160
And worked it out, found out this, that,

20:07.360 --> 20:10.160
every kind of a combination and these things.

20:12.920 --> 20:16.600
And then also, when you start doing that, you get the knowledge.

20:17.080 --> 20:19.360
The Advent, our Gregoire has written, and I asked him,

20:19.560 --> 20:22.400
“How did you get all these quotations?” He said, “I just got it.

20:22.600 --> 20:24.920
When I was writing, they just came to me

20:25.120 --> 20:27.560
either I read it in the book or in a newspaper,

20:27.760 --> 20:30.240
suddenly at that moment only I got it.”

20:30.440 --> 20:32.720
So that’s how the knowledge comes to you.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.800
Like today only

20:35.280 --> 20:38.760
I bought a nightdress from Shonu or something,

20:38.960 --> 20:41.320
so Rustom said,” Mother, you never wear”.

20:41.520 --> 20:43.560
I said, “No, I don’t. I wear sari.”

20:43.840 --> 20:47.440
He said, “I know because the Devi is not supposed to sleep in the nightdress”.

20:47.880 --> 20:48.760
Devi, you see?

20:48.960 --> 20:51.040
Twenty four hours I am on duty.

20:51.720 --> 20:54.920
When should I undress Myself?

20:57.480 --> 20:59.080
It’s correct.

21:00.160 --> 21:03.880
He told Me this, that, “How can a goddess be undressed in the night?

21:04.080 --> 21:06.920
Because she has no night and she has no day.”

21:11.360 --> 21:15.320
The way he has studied it is really remarkable, you see?

21:15.840 --> 21:19.640
The way he has studied all the names of the goddess, the meanings and all that, you see.

21:19.880 --> 21:22.040
Gives you such tremendous strength,

21:22.560 --> 21:24.840
and the identification with that.

21:25.160 --> 21:28.680
He said, “How can the goddess retire?

21:28.880 --> 21:30.840
She has no retirement.

21:31.080 --> 21:34.120
When she sleeps, she’s working harder, still.”

21:35.160 --> 21:36.480
Is a fact.

21:43.960 --> 21:47.040
And all this understanding comes

21:48.960 --> 21:50.840
by identifying

21:51.720 --> 21:53.800
yourself with the creator.

21:54.680 --> 21:58.840
Because superficially it looks odd that I should sleep in a sari on, you are right..

22:00.000 --> 22:03.800
But if you fix one point, that whatever Mother does is a divine thing,

22:04.000 --> 22:07.960
then everything starts revealing to you, why She does it.

22:15.440 --> 22:17.560
Now this thing like Coca Cola.

22:17.760 --> 22:20.440
I, I, first I never used to take it.

22:21.800 --> 22:25.000
Now, there’s something gone better out of it,

22:25.240 --> 22:28.080
something has been removed from that Coca Cola,

22:28.320 --> 22:30.960
which was wrong there, now I  can take it.

22:31.360 --> 22:34.080
Never used to drink any Coca Cola.

22:38.520 --> 22:40.640
In small things, in big things, you can see

22:40.840 --> 22:43.000
today you see, at one point only I said,

22:43.200 --> 22:47.240
“I think you are going in a wrong direction.”

22:47.840 --> 22:49.680
On one point only I said.

22:49.880 --> 22:52.640
Of course I told him by what way to go and all that.

22:52.840 --> 22:55.680
But just one, and that was the point he made a mistake.

23:05.600 --> 23:07.640
Many things I have to do.

23:07.840 --> 23:12.360
I have to manage this big stuff, you know?

23:12.640 --> 23:14.880
It’s a very difficult task.

23:15.160 --> 23:19.320
To be a human being is the most difficult task I say.

23:21.040 --> 23:23.800
But I am managing it quite all right

23:25.040 --> 23:26.840
and you should use that.

23:27.040 --> 23:30.480
You should use that to camouflage Me, in the beginning; very much.

23:30.680 --> 23:33.320
You should say: “Just like us, She is absolutely human.

23:33.520 --> 23:34.640
She drinks tea,

23:34.840 --> 23:35.920
She sits with us,

23:36.120 --> 23:37.280
She talks to us.

23:37.480 --> 23:39.040
It’s nothing like that,

23:39.240 --> 23:41.440
and we know what we are doing, every word.

23:41.640 --> 23:44.360
In only a cult you become fanatic and you don’t know what you are doing.

23:44.560 --> 23:46.800
It’s not like that. We know everything.

23:47.000 --> 23:49.280
We know how people are mesmerized.

23:49.480 --> 23:52.640
We know what chakras are, We know everything about it.

23:52.840 --> 23:54.240
Cult is ignorance.

23:54.440 --> 23:55.960
This is knowledge.”

24:01.360 --> 24:04.880
“And we don’t want you to be unfortunate people”.

24:05.200 --> 24:07.320
We don’t want you to reign

24:09.920 --> 24:11.040
yourself in

24:12.080 --> 24:13.920
complete terror

24:14.160 --> 24:18.520
and to be under the reign of terror and agony

24:18.760 --> 24:20.880
and frustration

24:21.080 --> 24:25.320
You should ask the people who were there for twelve years, thirteen years, all these movements,

24:25.520 --> 24:26.720
“Where are they?”

24:26.920 --> 24:30.120
“What has happened?” They are only in Sahaja Yoga.

24:30.680 --> 24:35.720
Most of those senior people of all these gurus are in Sahaja Yoga.

24:46.560 --> 24:47.840
Charismatic movement.

24:48.040 --> 24:50.600
You should have seen the charismatic, bapre!

24:50.880 --> 24:51.920
The fellow went into ...

24:52.120 --> 24:53.080
You were not there?

24:53.280 --> 24:53.800
Sahaja Yogi: I don’t know.

24:54.000 --> 24:57.600
Shri Mataji: In France, they went into a big

24:59.320 --> 25:02.360
we’ve never seen such an epilepsy. For how much time, do you know?

25:02.600 --> 25:05.320
Sahaja Yogi: Long. Sahaja Yogi: More than half of an hour I think.

25:05.520 --> 25:07.520
Shri Mataji: At least half an hour.

25:07.720 --> 25:08.760
Sahaja Yogi: Yes. It’s crying, and

25:08.960 --> 25:10.360
sick and everything.

25:10.560 --> 25:13.560
Shri Mataji: And apart from that the whole body was shaking.

25:13.920 --> 25:15.720
Sahaja Yogi: In total convulsions.

25:16.880 --> 25:20.160
Shri Mataji: And he got cured. I just yield to him, “You get up now.”

25:20.360 --> 25:21.400
Hello.

25:22.360 --> 25:23.960
Is Jason here?

25:24.520 --> 25:25.720
Yes.

25:26.160 --> 25:27.640
Oh, good.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.960
Hello, Jeremy. How are you? Good?

25:36.320 --> 25:38.960
Daisies and daisies, these days. Just see.

25:39.240 --> 25:42.040
I’ve never seen a daisy like this before.

25:42.800 --> 25:44.560
Sahaja Yogi: Mother, can you take?

25:46.600 --> 25:47.680
Shri Mataji: What a color!

25:47.880 --> 25:50.600
And here the Sahasrara is very strong, do you see that?

25:50.800 --> 25:52.240
Sahaja Yogi: Beautiful is that.

26:04.120 --> 26:06.920
Shri Mataji: And daisies are very fragrant these days, very fragrant.

26:07.120 --> 26:08.600
Child: Nanny’s name is Daisy.

26:08.800 --> 26:10.480
Shri Mataji: Hmm, that’s why.

26:11.120 --> 26:12.680
They all know.

26:17.360 --> 26:20.240
The daisies have the greatest variety now, I think.

26:20.920 --> 26:22.680
I’m going to see in the ...

26:22.880 --> 26:26.040
I don’t know, when are they going to have that

26:26.880 --> 26:28.880
Chelsea Flower Show. Next week?

26:29.080 --> 26:29.960
Next month?

26:30.160 --> 26:31.440
A week or I don’t know when?

26:32.120 --> 26:33.520
Sahaja Yogini: It’s in May.

26:33.720 --> 26:35.320
Sahaja Yogi: Very soon.

26:35.880 --> 26:38.280
Very soon, Mother. This month.

26:38.920 --> 26:41.440
Shri Mataji: They were building up all these things, today we saw.

26:41.640 --> 26:43.800
But maybe next week, maybe.

26:50.720 --> 26:53.120
You should say, “These arguments have no meaning,

26:53.320 --> 26:55.200
doesn’t give you any strength.

26:55.400 --> 26:58.040
Don’t be misled. It’s not good.

26:58.760 --> 27:02.720
You see, you can brand anybody as cult, but what you will get out of it, you see?

27:03.080 --> 27:07.840
There is no money, there is no organization, there is no membership.

27:08.040 --> 27:10.880
How can it be a cult? And we are very normal people.

27:11.080 --> 27:12.160
We are not strange.

27:12.360 --> 27:14.840
First thing is they should be strange people doing something strange.

27:15.040 --> 27:17.480
We don’t do anything strange.”

27:20.320 --> 27:22.240
They might say that you move your hands and things.

27:22.440 --> 27:25.320
You should say that, “When the power starts flowing from our hand,

27:25.520 --> 27:28.720
we have to use our hands; we can feel the power flowing”.

27:32.200 --> 27:33.440
All right?

27:33.640 --> 27:36.240
When did you go? To see whom?

27:37.320 --> 27:41.840
Sahaja Yogi: (If I might,) I just saw them, I didn’t go to see them. I just has happened to see them.

27:42.480 --> 27:45.040
I didn’t go to see them, Mother. They just happened to be there,

27:45.240 --> 27:48.160
at the time I’ve just was passing,

27:48.360 --> 27:50.920
at the same time as they were.

27:51.120 --> 27:54.080
So we got into sort of natural talk, you know.

28:00.120 --> 28:03.040
Shri Mataji: You go, go and talk to that fellow, who is well known

28:03.240 --> 28:05.040
or whatever is his. What is his name?

28:05.240 --> 28:08.800
Sahaja Yogi: I’ve been working on him, Mother. Talking with him a few times.

28:09.000 --> 28:11.240
His name, his name is John Noyce, Mother.

28:11.440 --> 28:14.680
His name is John Noyce, Mother. And ...

28:14.880 --> 28:17.840
Shri Mataji: (Let him,) let Phil and all these people go and see him.

28:18.080 --> 28:18.600
Sahaja Yogi: Yes

28:18.800 --> 28:20.320
Shri Mataji: Good idea.

28:21.360 --> 28:24.280
Nick is there, anyone feels is normal.

28:24.480 --> 28:27.480
Take three, four people and you talk.

28:27.680 --> 28:29.320
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Mother.

28:32.240 --> 28:35.040
Shri Mataji: Danny is there. Now, anyone.

28:38.000 --> 28:41.640
And need not be people from, say, from Brighton.

28:42.040 --> 28:46.760
If you are from the same place nobody has any respect for you.

28:47.040 --> 28:48.560
You should take people from ...

28:48.760 --> 28:51.560
These are all human psychologies. You must work it out.

29:02.520 --> 29:06.880
I think I should sleep now, 11:30. All right?

29:22.960 --> 29:26.200
"See, if you have the caliber you’ll get through, you’ll see.

29:26.400 --> 29:29.960
Not the heart. If you say that, you’ll hurt them. But it’s a caliber, you see.

29:30.160 --> 29:34.400
“That’s true, but one has to have that caliber, of a seeking.

29:34.600 --> 29:38.480
If you are superficial seekers, then it’s rather difficult I think, it’s better.

29:38.680 --> 29:42.400
But if you are deeply seeking, than it works out, no doubt.

29:42.600 --> 29:44.000
We have seen that.”

29:44.200 --> 29:46.400
You cannot say you, but you should say,

29:46.600 --> 29:49.600
“We have seen some people, you see, who are very superficial type.

29:49.800 --> 29:52.720
They really do not stick on, they just get out.

29:52.920 --> 29:55.560
But we have some people of very high caliber.

29:55.800 --> 29:58.720
They just come into it and they have the pattern, they just fit into it like that.

29:58.920 --> 30:00.040
It’s a fact.

30:00.240 --> 30:01.760
We are not telling lies, you see?”

30:03.000 --> 30:06.560
But this will put up their challenges and they will be better off.

30:09.400 --> 30:12.160
All right, so if you don’t mind

30:13.800 --> 30:16.560
I wanted to have a bath; now I’ll have it tomorrow morning.

30:16.800 --> 30:18.960
I was saying that

30:19.160 --> 30:22.280
tomorrow morning these children would like to go to the

30:22.640 --> 30:25.800
children’s this thing or something?

30:45.840 --> 30:47.800
Sahaja Yogi: Very good, Mother.

30:48.320 --> 30:51.720
Shri Mataji: I told her. She, she took so much interest in Me, suddenly.

30:51.920 --> 30:54.480
We were on the same table, she was just facing me

30:54.680 --> 30:58.320
and there were other eight people all together, small table.

30:59.040 --> 31:01.880
But she took so much interest in Me, I don’t know why.

31:04.000 --> 31:08.360
She asked me several questions, different, different, so many questions she asked me.

31:08.600 --> 31:12.080
And one of them was -

31:12.360 --> 31:13.800
She asked -

31:14.200 --> 31:16.440
I told her we were very happy,

31:16.640 --> 31:20.480
Indians were very happy when you said nice things about the Indians settled here.

31:20.680 --> 31:22.800
“Oh, I mean it, I mean it.

31:23.000 --> 31:25.480
They’re very spiritual endowed people, you see.

31:25.680 --> 31:28.600
How we live our life we have made a mess of our lives

31:28.800 --> 31:33.000
they are sensible, their children are educated, they are very solid people

31:33.200 --> 31:37.040
and they have, they have lot of -

31:37.240 --> 31:39.440
they have given a lot of contribution

31:39.640 --> 31:41.800
to the growth of this country”, she said.

31:42.000 --> 31:44.880
So she said, “How do they manage this spiritual side, you know?”

31:45.080 --> 31:46.280
I said, “It’s like a,

31:46.480 --> 31:49.120
your developing is that of the shoot I think,

31:49.320 --> 31:51.600
and we are on the root’s side perhaps”.

31:51.880 --> 31:53.520
“Oh, must be that.”

31:56.000 --> 31:58.480
And then she has asked another question to them,

31:58.680 --> 32:01.160
“I’ve seen people who are academically very good, you know.

32:01.360 --> 32:04.440
They, I don’t know, they get western sometimes.

32:04.640 --> 32:06.800
I don’t know what happens to them.

32:07.000 --> 32:10.200
They are very good as individuals, they do very well.

32:11.400 --> 32:13.200
They’re individualistic

32:13.400 --> 32:16.280
but what happens to them later on, I don’t know in life.

32:16.520 --> 32:18.840
So she asked them, “They say, there is somebody saying”
