00:07.943 --> 00:17.395
Now what is the difference between animal magnetism
and world magnetism, human, and vibrations?

00:17.648 --> 00:23.473
It’s very simple.
I don’t understand how Sahaja Yogis don’t know.

00:24.040 --> 00:31.013
Animal magnetism acts without the awareness of the animals.

00:31.013 --> 00:41.277
But when human magnetism is awakened, it
acts according to the awareness of the man.

00:41.358 --> 00:45.231
I don’t know driving but I know the roads.

00:45.304 --> 00:50.995
I know the right and left, that’s all, there are only two turns.

00:51.149 --> 00:58.309
Whether it is North or South, you can
find out even if there is no sun.

00:58.957 --> 01:02.274
North and South you can find out whenever there is no sun.

01:02.324 --> 01:10.476
Now, in an animal, it has the magnet which just acts what’s

01:10.588 --> 01:16.508
the- there is a medical term in zoology
for that- as a reflex, as reflex.

01:16.586 --> 01:21.273
But when it is awakened in the human beings it comes into awareness.

01:21.273 --> 01:26.776
This is what it is that the Spirit comes into your awareness.

01:26.776 --> 01:30.364
You can have a rapport through the Spirit.

01:30.364 --> 01:36.340
It comes into your central nervous system that you can feel it.

01:36.340 --> 01:40.745
The difference is the same as a human being who’s a driver,

01:40.826 --> 01:49.683
knows when to turns the wheels and the car
is not aware, it just turns the wheels. Alright?

01:53.436 --> 01:57.980
What is it, that working, is the magnet.

01:58.061 --> 02:02.895
Even if you are the steel, it will attract

02:02.984 --> 02:05.980
but if you are a magnet then it will attract

02:06.061 --> 02:10.728
in such a way that it will never leave this magnet.

02:11.061 --> 02:16.762
So, for yoga it is important that you fix up your magnets

02:16.977 --> 02:27.353
of Shri Ganesha who is the child-like personality.

02:28.603 --> 02:34.186
A child, there’s one child,
everybody is attracted towards the child.

02:35.687 --> 02:39.459
One child gets stuck-up somewhere in the air,

02:39.540 --> 02:44.977
whether you are a Russian, American or an Arab,

02:45.061 --> 02:47.485
everybody would be worried about the child.

02:47.566 --> 02:49.132
What’s happening to the child?

02:49.213 --> 02:54.594
They will not think: it’s an Arab child or an American child, no.

02:54.675 --> 02:58.516
Unless and until it’s a devil.

03:00.645 --> 03:02.825
Why this attraction for children?

03:02.906 --> 03:07.315
Because their magnets are intact.
Their ego has not yet developed.

03:07.396 --> 03:10.897
Our ego developed, had to develop

03:10.978 --> 03:15.050
because we had to decide in our own freedom,

03:15.131 --> 03:18.423
what is right and what is wrong.

03:19.103 --> 03:21.439
So the ego developed was all right.

03:21.520 --> 03:25.364
Up to a point we should have developed our ego.

03:25.445 --> 03:30.105
But we overdeveloped it and overdeveloped it,

03:30.186 --> 03:32.338
overlapped the superego also.

03:32.419 --> 03:35.439
No conditioning, nothing.

03:35.520 --> 03:37.467
We’ll do whatever we like.

03:37.548 --> 03:39.937
Today we are wearing a half-pant,

03:40.018 --> 03:43.522
tomorrow we will wear a long pant, all right.

03:43.603 --> 03:47.896
Then we’ll cut our hair or we’ll do this, we’ll do that.

03:47.977 --> 03:50.230
No conditioning of any kind.

03:50.311 --> 03:55.038
All superego was also covered – ego.

03:57.807 --> 04:02.557
This ego would have been all right

04:02.744 --> 04:07.203
if you had kept your Ganesha tattwa.

04:08.061 --> 04:12.679
And what is that is the wisdom power of Ganesha.

04:15.251 --> 04:21.922
And the another point is that -- how much
magnetism you have? So you reverse back to yourself.

04:22.008 --> 04:27.474
The magnetism is a magic, is a magic of a person.

04:27.560 --> 04:30.949
A person is magnetic because he has certain magic.

04:31.029 --> 04:37.843
Now this magic is, comes, from your own personality.
From your own personality.

04:37.924 --> 04:45.901
The basis of magnetism, on the left hand
side, starts. And that basis is Shri Ganesha.

04:45.981 --> 04:50.101
Shri Ganesha is the basis of that magnetism.
So you're innocent.

04:50.181 --> 04:56.779
Innocence is the best way to have that magnetism.
Magnetism you cannot express in material way.

04:56.859 --> 05:02.702
It's not a material stuff but it is something abstract,

05:02.782 --> 05:06.888
comes from your quality of Ganesha, Shri Ganesha.

05:06.969 --> 05:09.379
Such a person is magnetic.

05:09.459 --> 05:13.466
Magnetic means
that such a person attracts other person

05:13.546 --> 05:17.196
because of the weight of the person,

05:17.276 --> 05:21.298
because of the quality of the person.
Such a person attracts.

05:21.379 --> 05:26.695
But does not attract for lust, greed and nonsensical
things.

05:26.775 --> 05:32.396
But attracts another person because
of the fragrance of love in the subjects.

05:32.476 --> 05:35.757
Now it is always confused. Confused!.

05:35.837 --> 05:39.853
Because it's such an abstract thing so
one must understand it in a very subtle way.

05:39.933 --> 05:42.528
What is this magnetism? That one should understand.

05:42.608 --> 05:45.603
You see, there some gestures people use artificially.

05:45.683 --> 05:49.906
Which normally they have been using just to
attract other people, the way they walk,

05:49.986 --> 05:52.138
the way they dress, the way they live.

05:52.218 --> 05:57.045
All these things are of no use. It is something so inner,

05:57.070 --> 05:59.783
that fragrance is so inner which must be developed.

05:59.863 --> 06:04.630
But in Sahaja Yoga I have seen, people
just don't bother about it, just don't bother.

06:04.710 --> 06:08.451
They think the way they have been
living, the way they have been this...say,

06:08.531 --> 06:13.065
if they are English, they are English, if they are French they are French, if they are Indians they are Indians,

06:13.145 --> 06:16.850
if they are from Kolhapur they will be from Kolhapur.

06:16.931 --> 06:21.329
These ideas first must be curbed off,

06:21.409 --> 06:26.165
because the fragrance spreads everywhere whether you are English or anyone.

06:26.294 --> 06:32.194
So the fragrance of a person develops through, first of all, the Ganesha principle within you.

06:32.275 --> 06:35.873
Ganesha principle is to be first of all
seen to.

06:35.953 --> 06:44.420
Now a Ganesha person is not a person who is absolutely a remorse type

06:44.500 --> 06:49.991
or a person who is such a gone case that  even if you beat him up

06:50.071 --> 06:57.529
and make him into a complete minced thing, he will bear it. It's not like that!

06:57.610 --> 07:04.775
It's not that. On the contrary the quality
of magnetism is such that it attracts you,

07:04.915 --> 07:09.346
to a point where you are not disturbed.

07:09.432 --> 07:12.233
Now this is a very important point we should know.

07:12.314 --> 07:17.901
You see, if you have other loves, love
like carnal love and all other love you have,

07:17.981 --> 07:25.643
then that love you may attract the person. That
person can destroy you and it destroys you, always.

07:25.723 --> 07:31.248
But this attraction does not destroy, does not destroy.

07:31.328 --> 07:35.716
The attraction is up to that point that you are not destroyed,

07:35.796 --> 07:40.212
because you being much higher, much deeper and much weightier,

07:40.292 --> 07:44.069
you cannot be destroyed by a thing that you are attracting.

07:44.149 --> 07:48.739
Always the greater magnet attracts the smaller magnet.

07:48.819 --> 07:50.925
And that is what one should understand.

07:51.005 --> 07:58.846
This magic and this karishma, the charismatic temperament of a person

07:58.926 --> 08:03.582
comes by, first of all, the Ganesh tattwa, innocence.

08:03.662 --> 08:09.498
And secondly by complete dedication and devotion.

08:09.579 --> 08:15.253
Those who are completely dedicated and devoted
to Mother.

08:15.333 --> 08:18.901
Not to anything else. Ganesh tattwa again.

08:18.981 --> 08:24.059
Not to your wife, not to your husband,
not to your sister, not to your country,

08:24.140 --> 08:27.585
not to anyone but to Mother.

08:27.665 --> 08:37.938
Complete dedication gives you that charisma, or that attraction.

08:38.019 --> 08:43.992
In Sahaja Yoga such a person becomes really attractive and such a person has ??????.

08:44.079 --> 08:46.881
Now some people think that if you are..

08:55.976 --> 09:02.665
Some people think that if you are a very passive person

09:02.746 --> 09:06.030
and if anybody says anything to you

09:06.111 --> 09:12.256
and you don't mind, sort of a person you are
charismatic. It is not.

09:12.336 --> 09:17.051
People like you because they can dominate you.

09:17.131 --> 09:20.687
They like you because they can dominate you.

09:20.767 --> 09:24.386
Now if you think that by your aggressiveness and by your shouting

09:24.466 --> 09:27.361
and by your screaming at these people,

09:27.361 --> 09:33.684
you will achieve that charismatic temperament, you cannot.

09:33.764 --> 09:37.310
You cannot achieve that height.

09:37.391 --> 09:43.040
So how do you achieve it? By becoming more innocent.

09:43.127 --> 09:50.127
Now how innocence develops in a person is by not thinking about it.

09:50.214 --> 09:54.512
So may God bless you all.

09:54.512 --> 10:02.028
I want you people to develop concentration of mind

10:02.109 --> 10:11.370
so that you rise above all other misidentifications

10:11.451 --> 10:20.475
and get identified with the Pure Spirit, through your Mahalakshmi principle.

10:20.556 --> 10:22.510
May God bless you.
