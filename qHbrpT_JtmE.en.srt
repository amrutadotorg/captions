00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:06,714
This is a recording of the advice
given by her Holiness Mataji Nirmala Devi,

2
00:00:06,914 --> 00:00:10,733
on 22nd March 1977,

3
00:00:10,933 --> 00:00:12,850
at Bhakti Vidya Bhavana,

4
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:17,537
in the form of questions and answers.

5
00:00:23,006 --> 00:01:27,120
[Shri Mataji speaks Hindi and Marathi]

6
00:01:27,321 --> 00:01:29,800
They have mastered the Kundalini completely.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,999
There are some, you know that,

8
00:01:32,199 --> 00:01:37,132
but there are some who have got
realization last five years and they don’t know a word.

9
00:01:37,333 --> 00:01:41,209
On the contrary, they’ll just come and
ask us, “My mother is ill. So please treat her.”

10
00:01:41,409 --> 00:01:44,067
“My father is ill.” “You treat me.” “My this thing is ill.”

11
00:01:44,267 --> 00:01:46,535
That’s all. They are good for nothing.

12
00:01:46,736 --> 00:01:50,694
So now you have to also give to others and you have too,

13
00:01:50,895 --> 00:01:55,652
realize yourself and to be the light of Sahaja Yoga.

14
00:01:55,852 --> 00:01:59,998
It’s a great pleasure. It’s a
greatest joy, to give it to others,

15
00:02:00,198 --> 00:02:05,784
and you don’t have to spend any money for
that and you don’t have to earn any money for that.

16
00:02:05,984 --> 00:02:09,455
It is just a free flow. But you must give.

17
00:02:09,736 --> 00:02:13,249
Otherwise, if you do not give then you stagnate;

18
00:02:14,147 --> 00:02:15,961
absolutely, it stagnates.

19
00:02:16,161 --> 00:02:19,136
Today we have so many people
over here, I’m very happy to see.

20
00:02:19,336 --> 00:02:23,156
I hope you’ll keep up the
number. At least on a Monday keep it.

21
00:02:23,357 --> 00:02:56,013
[Shri Mataji speaks Marathi and Hindi].

22
00:02:56,214 --> 00:03:01,567
Sahaja Yoga is not a thing to be taken that frivolously.

23
00:03:01,767 --> 00:03:05,629
It works. It works in you in no time effortlessly,

24
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:10,612
but after realization, for all
human beings it is necessary,

25
00:03:10,812 --> 00:03:15,938
to understand the complete working
of the Kundalini and of the vibrations.

26
00:03:16,138 --> 00:03:18,247
You must know the complete science.

27
00:03:18,447 --> 00:03:24,037
Otherwise, what is the use of getting money
which you do not know how to spend or use?

28
00:03:24,238 --> 00:03:26,382
So best thing is to get to it

29
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:32,220
and by you will find that even if
you are sick and cured by Sahaja Yoga,

30
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:35,668
you’ll find you’ll become so much healthier and better.

31
00:03:35,868 --> 00:03:37,769
You’ll be enriched much more.

32
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:43,819
If you do not take to Sahaja Yoga, gradually
you’ll find your vibrations will be lost after some time,

33
00:03:44,019 --> 00:03:49,233
because God doesn’t want to waste His vibrations on people,

34
00:03:49,433 --> 00:03:51,996
who do not want to give it to others.

35
00:03:53,092 --> 00:03:55,690
There are some people who give explanations,

36
00:03:55,890 --> 00:04:01,766
“We have a family. How are we to give up?” Now I
have also family. You know I have grandchildren also.

37
00:04:03,029 --> 00:04:07,302
This is the only good thing
you can do without paying a single pie.

38
00:04:07,502 --> 00:04:09,988
You have got it without paying a single pie and

39
00:04:10,088 --> 00:04:12,567
you have to distribute also without paying a,

40
00:04:12,767 --> 00:04:15,836
single pie and you have to enjoy yourself.

41
00:04:16,037 --> 00:04:19,733
Only you can enjoy if you can give.

42
00:04:20,688 --> 00:04:25,717
You have to learn all these things.
By God’s grace you have so many people here.

43
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:28,643
Here now at least fifty percent people, I would say,

44
00:04:28,843 --> 00:04:33,227
are such that they can tell you about Kundalini quite well

45
00:04:33,691 --> 00:04:36,114
and you they are going to work out with you.

46
00:04:36,214 --> 00:04:38,597
They are going to tell you about this; nothing to feel bad,

47
00:04:38,797 --> 00:04:42,204
because once you master the
Kundalini you will become just the same.

48
00:04:42,405 --> 00:04:45,837
So there is nothing to feel
superior or inferior or anything.

49
00:04:46,037 --> 00:04:49,900
Only thing is that you today you
have jumped into the sea and you have,

50
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:53,825
learnt how to swim and they have learnt it long time back,

51
00:04:54,025 --> 00:04:58,056
and gradually you’ll pick up very
fast. Some people pick up so fast,

52
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:04,723
that it’s sometimes astonishingly speedy,

53
00:05:04,923 --> 00:05:08,109
and even the people who,

54
00:05:08,309 --> 00:05:12,423
have been with Me for years cannot beat them.

55
00:05:12,624 --> 00:05:18,655
So, it is only your simplicity and
earnestness to be that. You work it out very well.

56
00:05:20,131 --> 00:05:25,985
Aata, I would like you to ask Me
questions because when I go away I don’t want,

57
00:05:26,185 --> 00:05:29,101
the half-hearted people to ask questions

58
00:05:29,302 --> 00:05:31,920
because then the, if the questions start, then the

59
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:34,631
murmuring souls will start and they will try to,

60
00:05:34,831 --> 00:05:40,720
bring out people who are not yet
half-baked, and then they will fizzle out.

61
00:05:40,921 --> 00:05:44,207
So, you have to completely mature into Sahaja Yoga.

62
00:05:44,407 --> 00:05:47,482
Do not listen to anybody because he says so.

63
00:05:47,683 --> 00:05:51,053
You ask him, “What is your authority?
Do you know anything about Kundalini?

64
00:05:51,254 --> 00:05:53,829
Have you, how many people you have given realization to?

65
00:05:54,029 --> 00:05:58,693
How many people you have given jagruti
to? None. Then you keep quiet.” That’s all.

66
00:05:58,894 --> 00:06:01,176
You have seen Kundalini moving.

67
00:06:01,376 --> 00:06:03,567
You have seen its pulsation.

68
00:06:03,767 --> 00:06:08,747
You have felt the vibrations.
Now, anybody who talks about against,

69
00:06:08,947 --> 00:06:13,486
Sahaja Yoga is very easy, anybody
can, any Dick, Tom and Harry can say,

70
00:06:13,788 --> 00:06:16,466
very easy to criticize anything,

71
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:20,521
very easy because how much does it
take? You don’t need any capital for that.

72
00:06:20,722 --> 00:06:23,128
You need not be knowing a word about Kundalini.

73
00:06:23,328 --> 00:06:25,738
Some might say it’s a myth, it’s a psychological

74
00:06:25,838 --> 00:06:28,143
thing; all kinds of nonsense they will say.

75
00:06:28,343 --> 00:06:30,605
But if you are a serious people, then you must

76
00:06:30,705 --> 00:06:33,067
understand that you have felt the vibrations,

77
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:36,922
they are there, and that you are going to proceed further.

78
00:06:37,123 --> 00:06:41,567
It is for your own good and for
your own asking you should get it.

79
00:06:41,767 --> 00:06:47,512
If there are certain problems on your chakras
they must be corrected. So, what is the question now?

80
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:58,980
Yogi: What is the ego and
superego and Why God has given this to us?

81
00:07:00,251 --> 00:07:05,675
Shri Mataji: Ego and superego; these are the
two institutions. They grow within us as we grow,

82
00:07:05,949 --> 00:07:12,274
older and older because when we start growing.

83
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:16,009
I’ll give you an example how the ego and super-ego grow.

84
00:07:16,209 --> 00:07:20,748
A mother is nursing the child, and the child is in complete...

85
00:07:24,383 --> 00:07:29,791
The mother is in complete
bliss when the child is being nursed.

86
00:07:31,648 --> 00:07:34,135
Now, what happens,

87
00:07:34,335 --> 00:07:39,450
when the mother moves the child to
another side, then the child doesn’t like it.

88
00:07:39,651 --> 00:07:43,559
So he puts in a reaction. This reaction comes in..

89
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:48,135
[Don’t look there. They are not minister.

90
00:07:48,335 --> 00:07:53,783
He wears cap so everyone
thinks he is minister. Your attention

91
00:07:53,883 --> 00:07:59,255
is not here. He is just a lawyer –Marathi]

92
00:07:59,455 --> 00:08:02,009
...for your information haan…

93
00:08:02,209 --> 00:08:05,276
[Now remove that cap otherwise everyone will

94
00:08:05,376 --> 00:08:08,542
again think that some new minister has come,

95
00:08:08,756 --> 00:08:19,597
Now we should meet them last time my son did not get job.
You will think about it then. Mother is asking a person as why did

96
00:08:19,697 --> 00:08:30,900
you wear that cap now everyone is thinking that you are a
 minister. Now people will bring application to you so don’t tell me.

97
00:08:32,250 --> 00:09:05,956
I will answer his question he has asked about ego & superego. Did you get my point? Now if someone go then all will see that person. How can I get benefit from that? Why human brain is so frivolous. You have something & god

98
00:09:06,056 --> 00:09:40,616
has given you a big head. You should give respect to it. Do not turn your eyes. Which is the thing which attract
your attention? Attention is very big thing. Attention should be pure. This is a bad habit to turn eyes – Marathi]

99
00:09:41,236 --> 00:09:44,469
Our eyes are ruined by because of the turning our eyes

100
00:09:44,669 --> 00:09:47,759
all the time here and here. Our Agnya chakra gets spoilt.

101
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,765
You completely lose control over your eyes.

102
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:54,523
Eyes are the most important things.

103
00:09:56,634 --> 00:10:00,900
They carry the light of your
heart of your Aatma and Spirit.

104
00:10:01,187 --> 00:10:04,767
At every small spot must you see?

105
00:10:05,212 --> 00:10:10,192
[If you want to sit then sit
& want to go then go – Marathi]

106
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:17,567
This is the problem with us, that
we don’t understand our own values

107
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:24,391
and we don’t understand what
should be our priority for what are we here.

108
00:10:24,592 --> 00:10:27,536
We must have that seriousness about ourselves.

109
00:10:28,282 --> 00:10:32,659
Anybody comes in or goes in or anything happening,

110
00:10:32,859 --> 00:10:36,087
your attention should be on to yourself.

111
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:40,370
It’s very necessary at this
time when you are in meditation.

112
00:10:40,571 --> 00:10:44,567
This is the first time we are trying to see ourselves.

113
00:10:44,767 --> 00:10:47,012
So why should anybody interest us?

114
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:52,181
It is only a very short time when we are –

115
00:10:53,244 --> 00:10:55,443
so now I’m telling you a very important thing...

116
00:10:55,644 --> 00:11:06,441
[At that time you come & everybody was looking at
you. It should not happen. Someone will come & someone

117
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:17,334
will go but you should not look at them. Now subject
is very deep. Why god has given us ego & super-ego.

118
00:11:17,592 --> 00:11:19,400
It’s a very big question. - Marathi]

119
00:11:20,616 --> 00:11:25,924
Why God has created this ego and super-ego within us?

120
00:11:31,531 --> 00:11:36,558
From our stomach the medh,

121
00:11:36,758 --> 00:11:41,594
what you call the fat globules,
you can say medh, in the stomach,

122
00:11:41,956 --> 00:11:44,527
rises into our brain,

123
00:11:44,728 --> 00:11:47,900
passing through all these centers,

124
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:53,696
evolving to be the cells of the brain.

125
00:11:53,897 --> 00:11:55,900
Did you follow this point?

126
00:11:56,728 --> 00:12:02,233
Because medh even the brain is made of fat cells,

127
00:12:03,124 --> 00:12:05,124
what you call the mendu.

128
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:09,359
So for the medh to become the mendu,

129
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:14,567
it has to evolve to achieve a certain amount,

130
00:12:14,861 --> 00:12:20,497
of charges of awareness of human awareness,

131
00:12:20,878 --> 00:12:23,233
and the brain, human brain,

132
00:12:23,433 --> 00:12:27,900
is the most precious one because it has a dimension,

133
00:12:28,258 --> 00:12:34,313
which animals do not have, a mental
dimension, you can say, an emotional dimension.

134
00:12:34,702 --> 00:12:39,759
 Its physical dimension also has another dimension.

135
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:44,827
We can say that on every dimension we have four sides.

136
00:12:45,243 --> 00:12:51,799
Emotionally we understand love. We
understand how to receive, how to reciprocate.

137
00:12:52,594 --> 00:12:56,733
We understand beauty, we understand poetry,

138
00:12:58,528 --> 00:13:01,900
we understand sweet gestures.

139
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:08,736
We can create these things also.

140
00:13:09,369 --> 00:13:13,889
On the mental level our dimension has a fourth dimension,

141
00:13:14,089 --> 00:13:17,853
I should say, by which we create things.

142
00:13:18,054 --> 00:13:21,712
Animals cannot create; we can create.

143
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:29,900
On the physical also we have a special advantage,

144
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:34,372
that we have lifted our heads up,

145
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:38,233
our hands act in a different way than our feet,

146
00:13:38,433 --> 00:13:41,265
we have a better capacity to hold things.

147
00:13:41,466 --> 00:13:46,067
Not only that but we can use this body,

148
00:13:47,941 --> 00:13:51,690
to lift much higher things that are here;

149
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:54,652
for example, we can create a crane and lifted it.

150
00:13:54,853 --> 00:13:58,007
So, we have also got a power

151
00:13:58,207 --> 00:14:03,448
by which we can have mastery over the matter.

152
00:14:03,662 --> 00:14:07,294
This is not among the animals. So we have already,

153
00:14:07,495 --> 00:14:10,558
a higher dimension which is reached in our brain.

154
00:14:10,658 --> 00:14:13,567
Now, such a beautiful human brain is created.

155
00:14:15,368 --> 00:14:20,900
So, at this stage of human
evolution when man has reached this stage,

156
00:14:21,355 --> 00:14:24,080
we should say it is still in a transition.

157
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:28,720
A little more he has to jump, and he
becomes that for which he has created.

158
00:14:29,353 --> 00:14:34,295
So, in this transition it is
necessary to protect that brain

159
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:37,904
very carefully – one purpose;

160
00:14:38,105 --> 00:14:42,109
secondly, to make this brain independent,

161
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:46,101
of the will of God and to make it use by itself,

162
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:51,500
so it develops another dimension of wisdom.

163
00:14:55,268 --> 00:14:58,637
By faltering, by making mistakes,

164
00:14:58,837 --> 00:15:04,233
by correcting, by falling, by going into extremes,

165
00:15:04,433 --> 00:15:09,338
man starts coming in the center
and understands that this is the position.

166
00:15:09,539 --> 00:15:12,193
Now see in our country the political news,

167
00:15:12,393 --> 00:15:17,863
how from the British we came to
– British had to give us up, then we –

168
00:15:18,064 --> 00:15:22,131
now the new this thing we started that didn’t fail;

169
00:15:22,331 --> 00:15:24,703
that failed. So, we started another style.

170
00:15:24,903 --> 00:15:30,136
So, we started another style like that. You see, you
go on changing from this to another, experimenting,

171
00:15:30,336 --> 00:15:35,796
and you reach a position where you see this
is the position by which you really progress.

172
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:39,169
All this is done by a human brain.

173
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:42,490
So, a human brain is the most coveted thing,

174
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:46,233
most evolved thing,

175
00:15:46,433 --> 00:15:49,733
and with the brain heart also,

176
00:15:50,205 --> 00:15:54,303
human heart also, has to be co-related to the brain,

177
00:15:54,503 --> 00:15:58,058
and so the both the things evolve very well.

178
00:15:58,259 --> 00:16:00,779
Our stomachs are evolved very well.

179
00:16:00,979 --> 00:16:03,919
Actually, our stomachs are much more,

180
00:16:04,119 --> 00:16:07,646
subtle and they cannot take gross things.

181
00:16:07,846 --> 00:16:10,611
They require very fine and

182
00:16:10,811 --> 00:16:14,233
sophisticated things for digestion,

183
00:16:15,013 --> 00:16:19,497
and so many things as you know
that we are different from animals.

184
00:16:20,676 --> 00:16:27,469
Now at this stage to protect this brain
also you need a kind of a hard covering.

185
00:16:27,731 --> 00:16:33,778
So, God has created this system by
which you just get completely covered up,

186
00:16:34,175 --> 00:16:36,733
by creating an ego and super-ego

187
00:16:36,933 --> 00:16:42,413
which is just a sort of, you can
say, a by-product of your activities.

188
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:48,733
Any activity a human-being does, has a reaction.

189
00:16:49,111 --> 00:16:54,993
For example, if he tries to say “no” to
something it has a reaction: he creates his ego.

190
00:16:55,193 --> 00:16:58,584
If he accepts something he creates his super-ego.

191
00:16:59,012 --> 00:17:03,357
This is also done because it is done,

192
00:17:03,557 --> 00:17:08,076
with the help that the brain of the man is made triangular

193
00:17:08,276 --> 00:17:10,495
and prismatic in nature, prismatic.

194
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:14,620
It’s prism-like plane, and in the prism of the brain

195
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:20,112
when the rays of God’s divine power flows in,

196
00:17:20,386 --> 00:17:24,067
it goes into refraction, into different angles,

197
00:17:24,267 --> 00:17:28,287
and by the principle of parallelogram of forces,

198
00:17:28,487 --> 00:17:31,370
part of it escapes outside, this side and this side.

199
00:17:31,571 --> 00:17:35,604
That’s why a man can think of the future and of the past,

200
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:39,323
but the animal does not think of these things.

201
00:17:39,524 --> 00:17:44,140
So that’s how our brain is a specially made one.

202
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:49,450
It is protected by creating a
ego and a super-ego completely

203
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:53,793
by which our taalu, where the fontanel bone is covered,

204
00:17:53,993 --> 00:17:56,736
you are separated from the All-pervading Power,

205
00:17:56,836 --> 00:17:59,739
by which you get your independence and freedom,

206
00:17:59,941 --> 00:18:04,567
to act as you like, to use
your brain as you like, to learn,

207
00:18:04,894 --> 00:18:08,143
because the evolution if it has to go any further

208
00:18:08,343 --> 00:18:12,013
this is the transition period when you have to try.

209
00:18:14,244 --> 00:18:18,618
We can say like this for a simile
because simile should not be drawn too far.

210
00:18:18,819 --> 00:18:21,670
But supposing this instrument I prepare.

211
00:18:21,871 --> 00:18:27,342
After preparing it, I first
try it on a small cell separately

212
00:18:27,645 --> 00:18:30,188
and then I put to the mains.

213
00:18:30,471 --> 00:18:33,577
In the same way, first it is tried separately,

214
00:18:33,777 --> 00:18:36,934
individually with an articulation.

215
00:18:37,537 --> 00:18:40,993
The other day I gave a simile of a, of an egg,

216
00:18:41,193 --> 00:18:45,965
which might have sounded little
funny to Marathi people, I don’t know why,

217
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,247
that an egg is created

218
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:52,347
by articulating it completely, it’s protected.

219
00:18:52,656 --> 00:18:58,842
Till it reaches a complete
stage of its re-birth, is dwijah.

220
00:18:59,043 --> 00:19:03,692
Then only, you see, the mother bird pierces,

221
00:19:04,632 --> 00:19:06,900
the egg and the,

222
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:11,997
there is a re-birth of the little chick.

223
00:19:13,346 --> 00:19:18,733
In the same way, you are made
protected so that you are made ready.

224
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:20,567
Ultimately,

225
00:19:20,767 --> 00:19:26,394
you reach a stage where you are just
ready to jump into another state, and it happens.

226
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:30,455
In the incubator also, if you put these eggs,

227
00:19:30,656 --> 00:19:35,567
with the warmth, you see they
feel the warmth – warmth is the love –

228
00:19:35,767 --> 00:19:40,135
and with that they grow

229
00:19:40,438 --> 00:19:43,219
and at a point all of them hatch out,

230
00:19:43,493 --> 00:19:45,759
I mean not simultaneously,

231
00:19:45,959 --> 00:19:51,140
but we can say little difference, but most of
them hatch out within two three days’ time.

232
00:19:51,341 --> 00:19:54,874
It is in the same manner
today’s Sahaja Yoga is working out,

233
00:19:55,212 --> 00:19:57,506
that you are just ready to have it.

234
00:19:57,707 --> 00:20:01,480
You’ve had a very great past, you’ve been seeking,

235
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:05,447
you have been going round, you have
no ideas to what you have been doing.

236
00:20:05,648 --> 00:20:09,627
And today you are wearing
ordinary dresses like ordinary people

237
00:20:09,827 --> 00:20:13,469
and today you are here for a lecture with Me

238
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:16,160
and at this time this happens.

239
00:20:17,343 --> 00:20:21,400
This is the greatest miracle for some people,

240
00:20:22,488 --> 00:20:26,754
but for Me it is just a 
happening. It has to happen at this time.

241
00:20:26,954 --> 00:20:31,900
For us if we see lots of flowers 
turning into fruits, we never call it a miracle

242
00:20:32,259 --> 00:20:37,026
because we have taken it for granted. So
many miracles of life we have taken it for granted,

243
00:20:37,227 --> 00:20:42,815
but it has to happen to human-beings,
and when it happens it happens like that. -

244
00:20:43,204 --> 00:20:45,620
Naturally for you, you see,

245
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:49,275
it’s My child’s play. It is for Me, it is My child’s play

246
00:20:49,476 --> 00:20:54,400
because that is My job is to give you
moksha. I am mokshadayani; no doubt about it.

247
00:20:54,698 --> 00:20:59,785
If that is My nature, if that
is My nature then I will do it.

248
00:21:00,442 --> 00:21:03,755
If the nature of the sun is to give you,

249
00:21:04,243 --> 00:21:07,080
the rays of the sun, it will give.

250
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:10,400
It is not difficult because that is the nature.

251
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:15,974
You see, if it is your nature as a human
being to see things and colors you will see.

252
00:21:16,175 --> 00:21:18,567
What is so great about it?

253
00:21:18,997 --> 00:21:21,067
What is to be proud about it?

254
00:21:21,267 --> 00:21:25,545
I mean, I don’t understand; if you are that, you are that.

255
00:21:26,736 --> 00:21:30,567
What is there to be higher or
lower? I can’t just understand.

256
00:21:30,767 --> 00:21:35,900
This is all because of a human
ego that a man has evaluations.

257
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,733
He thinks this is higher; that is lower.

258
00:21:38,934 --> 00:21:41,127
In a way human beings are higher than men

259
00:21:41,327 --> 00:21:45,377
and human beings are much higher than gods

260
00:21:45,578 --> 00:21:48,105
and much higher than God Almighty sometimes,

261
00:21:48,305 --> 00:21:51,696
because He has to beg of you to come to Sahaja Yoga,

262
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:58,170
because unless and until you
are absolutely freely accepting

263
00:21:58,371 --> 00:22:00,336
Sahaja Yoga it doesn’t work out.

264
00:22:00,537 --> 00:22:02,509
You have to be absolutely free.

265
00:22:02,709 --> 00:22:06,466
I cannot entice you. I cannot
hypnotize you. I cannot do anything.

266
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:08,391
It has to be there.

267
00:22:08,663 --> 00:22:11,233
And that’s why if it works just like that,

268
00:22:11,433 --> 00:22:14,176
why should you feel that there is something wrong in it?

269
00:22:14,377 --> 00:22:17,563
It has worked with so many
people. So many people have felt it.

270
00:22:17,763 --> 00:22:20,600
You will also feel it. It is
your due. So, you are feeling it,

271
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,067
and supposing there is something wrong with the seed

272
00:22:23,267 --> 00:22:27,426
or something wrong with the
flower, then we will correct it also.

273
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,009
May take two days more; doesn’t matter.

274
00:22:31,209 --> 00:22:34,767
It is not something extraordinary for Me.

275
00:22:34,968 --> 00:22:39,067
Yes, it is in a way, because in
all My previous lives I have not done it.

276
00:22:39,267 --> 00:22:41,339
So, I feel very happy.

277
00:22:42,045 --> 00:22:47,233
For example, when you are a leaf
you can’t do the things of a flower,

278
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:50,930
when you are a root you are not doing that at all,

279
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:53,733
but when you are a flower

280
00:22:53,933 --> 00:22:56,505
then a bee can come and do it.

281
00:22:56,918 --> 00:23:01,233
What is so much surprising about it?

282
00:23:01,433 --> 00:23:04,659
Because it has been promised. Many a time it has been said.

283
00:23:04,859 --> 00:23:09,567
Even Vivekananda has said that,
“Mother will come and She will do the job.”

284
00:23:09,767 --> 00:23:14,323
He has also said that,
“Buddha is just a part, a little drop.”

285
00:23:14,524 --> 00:23:18,400
He has said all these things. When
you quote Vivekananda, read him properly.

286
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,469
He also says, ‘I can’t do
anything. It’s Mother is going to do.

287
00:23:21,669 --> 00:23:24,125
Everybody is putting on that Mother.”

288
00:23:24,351 --> 00:23:26,939
Shankaracharya said, “Mother will come.”

289
00:23:27,264 --> 00:23:31,723
In the Bible if you read John’s Revelation, written that,

290
00:23:31,923 --> 00:23:35,071
“A Woman will come, and She will be giving,

291
00:23:35,272 --> 00:23:40,067
re-birth and She’ll be afraid of giving
re-birth. She’ll be protecting Her child.”

292
00:23:40,267 --> 00:23:42,236
All these things are there,

293
00:23:42,742 --> 00:23:44,810
and now when the Mother comes in you say,

294
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:49,107
“Why are you there, Mother?” Now who the
Mother must come with a horn or what should She do?

295
00:23:49,606 --> 00:23:53,320
But if I’m the Mother Who has
to do the job, I have to do the job.

296
00:23:54,718 --> 00:23:58,213
Now you start finding faults with
Me. So, what to do with you people?

297
00:23:58,413 --> 00:24:00,942
I mean, after all, what should I have?

298
00:24:01,143 --> 00:24:03,733
Whatever I thought proper, I have.

299
00:24:04,124 --> 00:24:06,527
What else do you want Me to have?

300
00:24:06,728 --> 00:24:10,400
See if the, if Ganesha has a trunk of a,

301
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,733
elephant it has a meaning,

302
00:24:13,235 --> 00:24:16,248
and if somebody has something else it has a meaning.

303
00:24:16,449 --> 00:24:19,770
We say that Surabhi the cow,

304
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:22,715
the first cow which appeared in the Brindavana –

305
00:24:22,915 --> 00:24:27,895
in the, in the Vaikuntha stage she
appeared? all the Gods were inside her.

306
00:24:28,095 --> 00:24:33,553
We accept a cow but we can’t accept a
human being who has got these powers.

307
00:24:34,672 --> 00:24:37,652
It’s all right. Don’t accept.
I’m saying not that you should,

308
00:24:37,852 --> 00:24:41,621
flatly accept Me because once I say
that there are many Mataji’s all over now.

309
00:24:41,822 --> 00:24:44,700
What I’m saying, you should feel the vibrations yourself.

310
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:48,014
You should take them. If you feel them,

311
00:24:48,214 --> 00:24:51,328
if you see the Kundalini rising, that is the first sign.

312
00:24:51,528 --> 00:24:54,896
If you see the Kundalini rising, you should.

313
00:24:55,277 --> 00:25:00,067
When I went to Ambernath there was one Janardhan Maharaj.

314
00:25:00,267 --> 00:25:02,598
He had come, you see, because he had heard about Me.

315
00:25:02,798 --> 00:25:05,353
He came just to take My pareeksha, whatever it is.

316
00:25:05,554 --> 00:25:08,400
So he was sitting near the stage,

317
00:25:08,964 --> 00:25:10,833
and people told Me that,

318
00:25:11,033 --> 00:25:15,167
“He may not accept You, Mataji.” I said,
“Let Me see. If he is a realized soul he may,”

319
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:19,429
and when I went inside on the
stage he just fell flat on My feet.

320
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:23,953
Then he told Me, “I saw everybody’s Kundalini
rising as soon as You stepped inside, I could see.”

321
00:25:24,153 --> 00:25:26,220
They can see also.

322
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:31,805
He saw everybody’s Kundalini rising as soon as I
came in. They would not rise but the Kundalini rose.

323
00:25:32,005 --> 00:25:33,476
“We wish You welcome.”

324
00:25:33,676 --> 00:25:36,528
So, if they know, many people
know. Gagangarh Maharaj knows.

325
00:25:36,728 --> 00:25:39,400
He’s told many people. I have not met him.

326
00:25:39,834 --> 00:25:42,160
He has told many people about Me.

327
00:25:43,529 --> 00:25:45,961
I never met him before. Then I went to see him,

328
00:25:46,161 --> 00:25:49,233
and he talked to Me as if he
would talk to an incarnation, he would.

329
00:25:49,433 --> 00:25:56,067
He never talked to Me as if he would talk to
Mrs. C.P. Srivastava. He didn’t know. He asked Me

330
00:25:56,267 --> 00:26:28,408
[This world has so many bad people. How can you do it? Do they trouble you? How do you incarnate suddenly? We saw Shri chakra opening so we realized that Shri Mataji is born. Akar ,ukar & makar
has also come before Shri chakra. We saw Shri Ganesh, Dattatreya, coming here before you came here. He said it so clearly. It is recorded. He said that Shri Mataji has given you so much –Marathi],

331
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,400
“Why has She given you?

332
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,233
What have you done?

333
00:26:32,663 --> 00:26:35,810
How many of you are going to give your life for Her?

334
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:39,647
She has given you this precious thing.

335
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:41,938
You cannot part with one farthing.

336
00:26:42,138 --> 00:26:46,006
What are you going to do for Her?” He scolded all of them.

337
00:26:46,403 --> 00:26:48,900
He said all these things; it is on the tape.

338
00:26:49,361 --> 00:26:53,460
There’s another person Mr. –
his name is Mr. Pralahad Brahamachaari.

339
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:56,409
He’s from Calicut.

340
00:26:56,610 --> 00:26:59,795
He went to America. He told
people about Me. They know about Me.

341
00:26:59,995 --> 00:27:02,622
He told that, “She has come now. There’s nothing to worry.”

342
00:27:02,823 --> 00:27:06,180
But for you people, you see, you people,

343
00:27:06,381 --> 00:27:11,104
are so egoistical that you cannot
bear to hear such a thing about anyone.

344
00:27:11,304 --> 00:27:14,994
That is the trouble: you are too egoistical.

345
00:27:15,863 --> 00:27:18,859
Adhajal gagri chalkat jaaye.

346
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:21,733
Empty vessel makes too much sounds.

347
00:27:21,933 --> 00:27:24,148
It’s a sign of emptiness.

348
00:27:24,811 --> 00:27:28,215
You see, they, those people are telling me even that

349
00:27:28,415 --> 00:27:31,567
[aside: what was his name from Ambernath]

350
00:27:31,974 --> 00:27:36,831
Naagnath Baba, he said, “Mataji, they can never accept.

351
00:27:37,143 --> 00:27:42,529
They never accepted any incarnation and they
are not going to accept You, try Your level best.”

352
00:27:42,839 --> 00:27:45,400
And Maharaj says, “For twelve years You try.

353
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:50,567
If they are all right, then I’ll come down.” Otherwise they
are all hiding themselves. They are afraid of human beings.

354
00:27:50,894 --> 00:27:52,567
Really, it is true.

355
00:27:53,148 --> 00:27:57,946
There are so many like that. Three
very old people came to see Me in Haridwar.

356
00:27:58,146 --> 00:27:59,799
They said the same thing.

357
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,519
Now are you going to behave yourself

358
00:28:02,719 --> 00:28:06,067
or are you going to behave in a manner

359
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:10,423
that is going to be detrimental
to your progress in spiritual life?

360
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:14,339
What are you going to do, it is for you to decide.

361
00:28:16,958 --> 00:28:22,180
 If you are, if you have read few books
you cannot sit, settle Me into those books.

362
00:28:22,381 --> 00:28:24,598
You see, there is Yoga shastra. Now take Yoga shastra.

363
00:28:24,798 --> 00:28:28,297
Now yesterday he told you
there is saatwik yogashastra this.

364
00:28:28,497 --> 00:28:32,425
What should by yogashastra for Me what is it?

365
00:28:32,703 --> 00:28:36,733
Did Rama read any books or Krishna read
any book and I am going to read any book?

366
00:28:36,933 --> 00:28:40,787
Am I going to use this
Yogashastra? You see, this is for people,

367
00:28:40,987 --> 00:28:43,233
for human beings who have to climb up.

368
00:28:43,433 --> 00:28:47,807
I know everything. So why
should I worry about these things?

369
00:28:48,008 --> 00:28:51,020
I have to just pull you out;
that’s all. I know all the job.

370
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:54,175
The person who knows the job doesn’t have to do this.

371
00:28:55,032 --> 00:28:57,733
And it comes to this that I have to tell you these things,

372
00:28:57,933 --> 00:29:01,941
you yourselves should realize that if
Mataji is doing like that just by chitta.

373
00:29:02,142 --> 00:29:04,501
Now see today there was, I’ll tell you a case.

374
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:08,085
Today there yesterday they told me about somebody,

375
00:29:08,285 --> 00:29:12,571
who, who is a brother [Is it our
brother – Marathi] who drinks too much

376
00:29:12,772 --> 00:29:15,315
and he is in Goa. I said, “What to do? How can he come?”

377
00:29:15,515 --> 00:29:19,323
He, he came today [aapo aap]. He came just like that.

378
00:29:22,475 --> 00:29:24,296
Just it is My attention, you see.

379
00:29:24,496 --> 00:29:26,801
If you put anything to My attention it just works.

380
00:29:27,001 --> 00:29:31,233
I don’t have to bother. It is
something like a human being can lift this.

381
00:29:31,433 --> 00:29:34,291
Now an ant will say, “How did you lift it?”

382
00:29:34,492 --> 00:29:37,452
I mean, it is possible for a human being to lift it the,

383
00:29:37,652 --> 00:29:39,999
and for Me it is easy to lift your Kundalini’s

384
00:29:40,099 --> 00:29:42,755
and to do all these miscellaneous things like that

385
00:29:42,955 --> 00:29:45,400
because it is My attention,

386
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:49,982
My attention, chitta. My attention itself is Ananda.

387
00:29:50,182 --> 00:29:54,163
It is itself, is bliss and it is itself, is the knowledge.

388
00:29:54,364 --> 00:29:57,359
I don’t need any intelligence to know anything because

389
00:29:57,559 --> 00:30:01,534
I know everything in My
head there is all the libraries there.

390
00:30:01,734 --> 00:30:05,390
Now you have read one book that fellow
has found out something from somewhere.

391
00:30:05,591 --> 00:30:09,509
Now how am I to tell you how this mad man
has found out something where from somewhere

392
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:12,624
and how did he find in darkness he what did he find?

393
00:30:12,825 --> 00:30:15,918
He might have found somebody’s
leg and was thinking it is somebody’s hand.

394
00:30:16,119 --> 00:30:20,342
Now for a person like Me it is
so difficult to go to every person.

395
00:30:20,542 --> 00:30:23,567
Anybody who has read a book
there, a sentence here, will come down.

396
00:30:23,767 --> 00:30:27,814
I said, “Now leave it. Now you want
your realization. Come along have it.”

397
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:33,421
And then the greatest problem is all this is love.

398
00:30:33,621 --> 00:30:37,733
I mean, I’m just a form of love;
that’s all. It’s nothing but love.

399
00:30:38,488 --> 00:30:42,067
It’s just love, you see, which
expands, gives you vibrations,

400
00:30:42,267 --> 00:30:45,119
again recedes back, expands, it comes back.

401
00:30:45,414 --> 00:30:50,417
It goes in a parabolic like that, what you
call the pradakshina of a shakti you are seeing.

402
00:30:50,617 --> 00:30:53,350
What is shakti is, shakti’s this thing is a parabolic,

403
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:55,820
and now Einstein is talking about parabolic.

404
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:59,466
We had a parabolic long time
back here. We knew it was shakti.

405
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:02,707
See, you can explain all your science and everything.

406
00:31:02,907 --> 00:31:07,073
In this life I learnt English language and
little bit of science and psychology and all that,

407
00:31:07,273 --> 00:31:09,784
but these psychologists are so one-sided people.

408
00:31:09,984 --> 00:31:12,077
Yoga shastras are so one-sided people.

409
00:31:12,277 --> 00:31:14,403
Now they do not match each other.

410
00:31:14,603 --> 00:31:17,400
I’m telling you the basic principle between the two.

411
00:31:17,642 --> 00:31:21,067
Both are human efforts. I’m a different person.

412
00:31:21,607 --> 00:31:24,067
Now what should I do if I’m like that?

413
00:31:24,647 --> 00:31:28,841
How can I become like you?
I mean, if I know how to come up,

414
00:31:29,041 --> 00:31:34,358
how should I become like a little baby and
say, “Oh, no, I must crawl up now gradually.”

415
00:31:38,982 --> 00:31:41,588
I’m an old woman of thousands of years.

416
00:31:41,788 --> 00:31:46,672
So I know everything. You are still
little babies. So how can I become like you?

417
00:31:47,866 --> 00:31:52,369
See, the simple thing and today is
the day I thought I better tell you about it

418
00:31:52,569 --> 00:31:57,772
that you just don’t worry about things
how I do things. I really do it. I cure people.

419
00:31:57,973 --> 00:32:00,567
Now here is a gentleman. He’s a heart patient, ask.

420
00:32:01,473 --> 00:32:04,693
Even before I met him he got quite cured, and I cured him.

421
00:32:04,894 --> 00:32:07,503
There are so many people here who will say that.

422
00:32:07,704 --> 00:32:10,908
[We told about our illness to Mataji – Marathi]

423
00:32:11,109 --> 00:32:15,228
Why? The question, the person who
asked me the question, you ask him.

424
00:32:15,656 --> 00:32:18,692
He has a friend who is in, who’s a Frenchman,

425
00:32:18,892 --> 00:32:22,050
and the Frenchman asked Me a
question about the Western life.

426
00:32:22,251 --> 00:32:26,307
So I didn’t answer it. I started saying
something else. He’s a very intelligent boy, this Rajesh.

427
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:29,567
So Rajesh said, “Now, you see,
Mataji has not answered your question.

428
00:32:29,767 --> 00:32:32,129
That means She has recorded it and it will act,”

429
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:34,838
because in his case it has acted.

430
00:32:37,901 --> 00:32:40,507
So God, whatever He has done it is for your good.

431
00:32:40,707 --> 00:32:44,577
He has given you ego and super
-ego not to get spoiled and finished.

432
00:32:44,778 --> 00:32:47,067
Now you can’t blame God for that.

433
00:32:47,365 --> 00:32:52,190
Supposing God has given you light to go that way.

434
00:32:52,391 --> 00:32:55,733
He has told you, “Now take an
independent light to find out that.”

435
00:32:55,933 --> 00:32:59,567
And if you start burning yourself
with that light, what can God do?

436
00:33:00,973 --> 00:33:02,571
It is not God’s mistake.

437
00:33:02,925 --> 00:33:06,266
Many people think that this
ego is horrid. Ego you must have.

438
00:33:06,467 --> 00:33:09,067
Ego you must have. You are not to fight this ego.

439
00:33:09,267 --> 00:33:14,132
Only thing is that your ego should become one
with that of God. That’s all. It’s a very simple thing.

440
00:33:17,468 --> 00:33:19,678
If you just become one with that God –

441
00:33:19,878 --> 00:33:22,698
now supposing this has a ego, how can I talk on this?

442
00:33:22,898 --> 00:33:25,255
I’ll say something; it will say some.

443
00:33:25,711 --> 00:33:29,616
But if it has no ego, its ego
has become one with My saying,

444
00:33:29,816 --> 00:33:34,529
then it carries My voice. It carries
My sayings, everything. It is so simple.

445
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:37,186
What is so much complicated

446
00:33:37,386 --> 00:33:40,365
when people start telling Me about big, big things,

447
00:33:40,565 --> 00:33:43,905
I really get a fright. I said, what is so complicated?

448
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:49,295
It is like, you see, somebody wanted
to know how do we make puris, you see.

449
00:33:49,626 --> 00:33:52,465
So a foreigner had come, a lady.

450
00:33:52,665 --> 00:33:55,456
So, she learnt, you know, how you make puris this thing,

451
00:33:55,556 --> 00:33:58,448
and one lady just tried to make fun of the whole thing.

452
00:33:58,649 --> 00:34:01,977
She said, “We make one roti here, one roti there.

453
00:34:02,177 --> 00:34:04,501
Then we put it one on top of another

454
00:34:04,701 --> 00:34:09,509
and then, all sorts of things. And
inside we put, something just to make it big

455
00:34:09,709 --> 00:34:14,444
and then we blow it out with
a phunkni,” and all those things.

456
00:34:14,645 --> 00:34:18,148
So this poor lady, she said that,
“How are you making it just like this,

457
00:34:18,348 --> 00:34:21,074
coming up like that. You are
putting in the kadhai, it’s coming up?”

458
00:34:21,275 --> 00:34:24,683
They said, “It is working out
because it’s the simplest thing to do,”

459
00:34:24,884 --> 00:34:28,351
but for her she said, “No, I was using a blower, blowing in

460
00:34:28,552 --> 00:34:31,370
because I thought that that’s the only way you can do it.”

461
00:34:36,815 --> 00:34:40,680
It is, it is a simple thing for
any housewife to create this thing.

462
00:34:40,881 --> 00:34:45,741
So you see for, when I hear all these
big, big things about yoga, this, that,

463
00:34:45,941 --> 00:34:49,159
then I said, “Baba, what are
you doing?” Now it is very simple.

464
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:53,349
It is a very simple thing,
but you can’t do it, is the point.

465
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:56,616
So I’m here. Once you are awakened,

466
00:34:56,816 --> 00:35:00,961
once your light has come, you can do it also. Why not?

467
00:35:01,161 --> 00:35:04,339
And I’ve told Gagangarh
Maharaj, when he started telling Me,

468
00:35:04,539 --> 00:35:08,093
“Why I cannot give realization
to people like this the way these.

469
00:35:08,293 --> 00:35:10,622
I’ve gone so much and I’ve done so much of this thing

470
00:35:10,822 --> 00:35:12,676
[I have given to one & now he is of no use – Marathi]

471
00:35:12,877 --> 00:35:15,733
and useless and how are You,
how are these people doing this?

472
00:35:15,933 --> 00:35:18,785
They will become very egoistical.” I said, “They will not.”

473
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:23,900
He said, “How do you know?” I said, “They
are made after the pattern of Shri Ganesh;

474
00:35:24,786 --> 00:35:28,694
same powers they will have. Even with the finger moving,

475
00:35:28,894 --> 00:35:31,567
My sons can give realization.

476
00:35:31,976 --> 00:35:36,549
They can. Who are you to
challenge and ask Me?” He kept quiet.

477
00:35:36,749 --> 00:35:39,055
He said, “You are a Mother. Do what you please,

478
00:35:39,256 --> 00:35:43,733
[ but it is not for foolish people” I said - Marathi]

479
00:35:44,013 --> 00:35:46,232
I’m not giving to them.

480
00:35:48,073 --> 00:35:50,400
It is a fantastic thing, that’s why.

481
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:55,645
You see, it is rather difficult for people to
understand, but anything like this has to be fantastic.

482
00:35:55,846 --> 00:35:58,233
And we have to prove the existence of God.

483
00:35:58,433 --> 00:36:00,900
We have to prove that He exists and He works,

484
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:04,270
and all those people, chaitanya lahiris and all that,

485
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:09,476
talks about Kabira and Nanaka
and Hiranya Sanhita and all your yoga,

486
00:36:09,676 --> 00:36:14,132
I’m going to prove it to you before. Have
you ever seen any Kundalini pulsating before?

487
00:36:14,332 --> 00:36:17,625
I will show you the pulsation of a Kundalini.

488
00:36:20,379 --> 00:36:23,445
You have never heard that there are on the fingers

489
00:36:23,545 --> 00:36:26,400
anywhere the vibrations are coming, nothing,

490
00:36:26,918 --> 00:36:30,664
but you have felt it not only
but you can diagnose a person.

491
00:36:30,865 --> 00:36:35,233
You can tell a person what he’s
suffering from. You can cure a person.

492
00:36:35,886 --> 00:36:38,567
Now you will say, “How is it possible?”

493
00:36:38,767 --> 00:36:43,941
and somebody says, “Ten thousand
years before we never heard of these things.”

494
00:36:44,142 --> 00:36:46,626
Everything must happen ten thousand years ago.

495
00:36:46,726 --> 00:36:49,640
Then why are we proceeding further? Better go back.

496
00:36:50,211 --> 00:36:52,310
What kind of a argument is this?

497
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:56,474
After all, we have discovered going to the moon.

498
00:36:56,674 --> 00:36:59,339
Then we never say, “Why did we go to moon?”

499
00:36:59,539 --> 00:37:02,459
You see, that’s a simple question there. We do not.

500
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:06,400
But we have to know that
somebody is searching inside for you,

501
00:37:07,284 --> 00:37:09,029
and I’ve found it out.

502
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:13,900
I’ve visited all these rakshasas also.
I’ve visited all these gurus, all of them,

503
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:15,900
very nicely befooling them,

504
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:20,512
and I tried to find out what are they
up too. Now I also know their tricks.

505
00:37:20,917 --> 00:37:23,900
I know what they have done to
you, and that’s how I can correct.

506
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:27,900
So I’ve studied all the
permutations and combinations and everything,

507
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:33,960
everything of Kundalini, whatever is possible
because, you know, it’s not so simple with human beings.

508
00:37:34,161 --> 00:37:39,596
They are very, very easily, they are very
easily can be persuaded. They can be enticed.

509
00:37:39,796 --> 00:37:43,900
They can be hypnotized – I cannot be hypnotized –

510
00:37:44,323 --> 00:37:47,950
but you can be very easily
hypnotized. Anybody can hypnotize you like that.

511
00:37:48,151 --> 00:37:51,739
I’ve seen thousands of people
getting hypnotized, taking out their clothes,

512
00:37:51,939 --> 00:37:55,107
dancing, jumping. I’ve
seen some people just making all

513
00:37:55,207 --> 00:37:58,708
kinds of faces, like this, like that, all sorts of things.

514
00:37:58,909 --> 00:38:04,134
It can be done, and the hypnosis is so much that
when they come before Me also they start doing that.

515
00:38:04,334 --> 00:38:07,707
They just get into the
hypnosis because they are used to it.

516
00:38:07,908 --> 00:38:10,774
It’s like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.

517
00:38:10,974 --> 00:38:14,900
They just become Mr. Hyde, and
Dr. Jekyll is lost. You become that;

518
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:16,973
it’s very common.

519
00:38:17,178 --> 00:38:20,370
So for you it is wise to understand that I know

520
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:23,900
all these things and I will tell you everything.

521
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:26,437
I’ve got it for you specially

522
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:29,219
and I know all the permutations and combinations.

523
00:38:29,319 --> 00:38:31,733
You don’t have to do any research about it.

524
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:34,575
No money is needed to be spent.

525
00:38:35,059 --> 00:38:38,674
Still, you see, there are people who have
been with Me for seven years. Still they are saying,

526
00:38:38,874 --> 00:38:41,762
“Mother, every time You say something we have to learn.”

527
00:38:41,963 --> 00:38:45,822
This is this, this is that, this is
combination, that is combination, everything.

528
00:38:46,022 --> 00:38:52,669
Even five lives will not be sufficient for
you to know a little bit about this knowledge.

529
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:56,400
So why worry about these
research and things? Just listen to Me

530
00:38:56,600 --> 00:39:02,537
and use your hands and learn and
discover also for yourself that this is the truth,

531
00:39:04,234 --> 00:39:08,136
and don’t listen to everyone,
third person coming round the corner,

532
00:39:08,336 --> 00:39:13,347
somebody selling the paan
there will tell you [Marathi] done.

533
00:39:13,855 --> 00:39:16,733
As if we have no brains at all, you see.

534
00:39:17,107 --> 00:39:21,120
So, you should not listen to
rumors. You are special people.

535
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:24,669
By God’s grace you have got
vibrations. This is a very big thing.

536
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:26,992
Those who haven’t got will also get it.

537
00:39:27,192 --> 00:39:29,567
I would request you every day

538
00:39:29,767 --> 00:39:33,485
you have to sit on the water for seven days

539
00:39:33,787 --> 00:39:37,438
to see that you are cleared out now after realization

540
00:39:37,638 --> 00:39:42,295
and also later on whenever you are
tired. It’s better; that’s a bath for you.

541
00:39:42,495 --> 00:39:45,300
Every day do that treatment yourself. It’s a bath.

542
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:49,419
You cleanse yourself because you gather. I do not gather.

543
00:39:49,619 --> 00:39:52,431
I, nothing happens to Me, but it happens to you.

544
00:39:52,631 --> 00:39:55,817
So, you must have a bath in the night,

545
00:39:56,017 --> 00:39:59,242
take out all the problems on that water, throw it away.

546
00:39:59,443 --> 00:40:03,400
Water with salt is a sea which
takes away all your problems.

547
00:40:03,641 --> 00:40:08,644
So try to do that, and there are so many
ways. We can use akasha. We can use prithvi.

548
00:40:08,844 --> 00:40:11,078
There are people; they can tell you; they know.

549
00:40:11,278 --> 00:40:14,939
I’ve told them that five-six people
should come here. We have a brain trust.

550
00:40:15,139 --> 00:40:18,317
They will be all sitting down here and talking to you.

551
00:40:18,634 --> 00:40:22,096
So next time when you come,
if you have any problem you can ask.

552
00:40:22,296 --> 00:40:26,493
Now maybe you are learned but you
can learn from them. Even person like,

553
00:40:26,693 --> 00:40:30,400
Justice Vaidya told Me that,
“I must know more about Sahaja Yoga.”

554
00:40:30,901 --> 00:40:34,853
So I said it is more practical than theoretical,

555
00:40:35,054 --> 00:40:41,422
and if he comes to the program or if somebody
can go to him or if he can work it out with his hand,

556
00:40:41,622 --> 00:40:45,950
gradually he will be become a master
of this because as it is he has knowledge.

557
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:50,233
It will fit into it as if, as if the
Ganges will flow into the, all the,

558
00:40:51,298 --> 00:40:56,400
all the ditches or all the things
that are made to receive the water

559
00:40:56,600 --> 00:41:00,148
and it will just go and settle into it, perfectly.

560
00:41:00,537 --> 00:41:02,771
Your reading is not going to be wasted,

561
00:41:02,971 --> 00:41:06,140
but you will know what is right what is wrong.

562
00:41:10,317 --> 00:41:12,742
Now if there is another question for one question

563
00:41:12,942 --> 00:41:15,936
I’ve taken so much time because
it was a very important question.

564
00:41:16,138 --> 00:41:18,837
Seeker: What is bath?

565
00:41:19,037 --> 00:41:23,005
[Bath means you have to kept my
photograph in front of me – Marathi]

566
00:41:23,206 --> 00:41:26,024
The photo has the vibrations; is a fact.

567
00:41:26,224 --> 00:41:28,789
Also, there are many things that have vibrations.

568
00:41:28,889 --> 00:41:31,553
For example, even this statue has got vibrations.

569
00:41:31,954 --> 00:41:35,739
Even these two statues have, but
not so much as they are from Me.

570
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:39,443
First of all, I am a living being.
Another is that their proportions,

571
00:41:39,643 --> 00:41:43,736
may be wrong because they are
created by human beings, by their imagination,

572
00:41:43,937 --> 00:41:46,430
but the swayambhu lingaas, all of them have got.

573
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:49,755
For example, now supposing
you have a prostate gland problem,

574
00:41:49,955 --> 00:41:53,723
if you go to the, say, to any of these

575
00:41:56,510 --> 00:42:07,446
[What is their name? Where did we
went to that Ganapati? No Titwala – Marathi]

576
00:42:07,646 --> 00:42:10,412
Raanjhan gaaon, Raanjhan gaaon Ganapati.

577
00:42:10,613 --> 00:42:13,649
You see, I went there. It has complete vibrations.

578
00:42:13,849 --> 00:42:18,545
Titwala because it is, you see, too much
visited by people. So it gets crowded sometimes,

579
00:42:18,746 --> 00:42:20,858
but Raanjhan gaaon I found still all right;

580
00:42:21,058 --> 00:42:26,158
but as soon I say Raanjhan gaaon everybody will go to
Raanjhan gaaon and the Raanjhan gaaon also will be spoiled.

581
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:30,067
Because after all these are the,

582
00:42:30,267 --> 00:42:34,839
these are the special statues
which have come out by Mother Earth.

583
00:42:35,039 --> 00:42:36,888
She’s thrown them. Mother Earth thinks,

584
00:42:37,089 --> 00:42:42,162
She creates these things and She
throws these things and they give vibrations.

585
00:42:42,362 --> 00:42:45,039
So, you take vibrations from them all.

586
00:42:45,239 --> 00:42:48,512
But My photograph is a photograph as a reality.

587
00:42:48,713 --> 00:42:54,220

588
00:42:54,421 --> 00:42:59,297
Another thing is, you see, whatever I
speak, because I’m that, it is pranava flowing.

589
00:42:59,497 --> 00:43:04,314
It is actual pranava. By every talk,
everything, is a mantra going into,

590
00:43:04,515 --> 00:43:07,733
and when I just put My finger also into it I found

591
00:43:07,934 --> 00:43:10,233
that My vibrations can be turned around.

592
00:43:10,433 --> 00:43:16,004
Even when I do like this,
those who are realized can feel it.

593
00:43:16,314 --> 00:43:19,614
On their Sahasrara they can feel; is a fact.

594
00:43:19,815 --> 00:43:23,116
So why should it look so funny to people?

595
00:43:25,431 --> 00:43:34,031
[What is their question? If you see all their chakra [Unclear]

596
00:43:34,131 --> 00:43:41,727
Please read it. They have asked about bath – Marathi]

597
00:43:41,928 --> 00:43:44,888
It is a simple method. You put my photograph in

598
00:43:44,988 --> 00:43:47,984
a proper place, put a little light before it.

599
00:43:48,184 --> 00:43:51,541
Candle will do, or you
can put a niraanjan, whatever you like.

600
00:43:51,742 --> 00:43:53,688
Put both the hands towards the photograph.

601
00:43:53,888 --> 00:43:56,572
Now you put both the hands towards the photograph

602
00:43:56,672 --> 00:43:59,067
and feet in the water with a little salt.

603
00:43:59,267 --> 00:44:04,495
You can have little hot water, cold water or
warm water according, according to the need.

604
00:44:04,695 --> 00:44:09,400
Supposing you are sick, suffering from cold,
so better to take the warm water. Put a little salt in it.

605
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:11,341
Put your hands towards the photograph.

606
00:44:11,541 --> 00:44:14,733
You’ll be amazed that the whole
trouble will go away into the water,

607
00:44:14,933 --> 00:44:17,548
and you can throw away the water in the W.C.

608
00:44:17,748 --> 00:44:21,468
and you’ll be very much clear. Now this gentleman you ask.

609
00:44:21,668 --> 00:44:26,733
He did that. He had a heart attack. He was very serious.

610
00:44:27,147 --> 00:44:29,518
Everybody can do it. Now for vishudhhi chakra,

611
00:44:29,618 --> 00:44:32,667
especially this chakra, another simple thing you can try,

612
00:44:32,867 --> 00:44:36,619
is to put your right hand towards the
photograph first and take out the left hand.

613
00:44:36,819 --> 00:44:39,071
Supposing you find the vibrations are flowing into it,

614
00:44:39,271 --> 00:44:43,067
then you put left hand towards
the photograph and right hand outside

615
00:44:43,338 --> 00:44:47,856
and you will be surprised that the whole
thing will clear out this chakra very well.

616
00:44:48,457 --> 00:44:53,400
And if you keep your eyes open towards
the photograph and put your hands like this

617
00:44:54,298 --> 00:44:56,659
or sometimes like this on the akaashaa,

618
00:44:56,859 --> 00:45:00,374
you’ll be surprised that your eyes
can be improved, very much with this.

619
00:45:00,575 --> 00:45:04,338
Mother Earth also; if you put
your head on the Mother Earth,

620
00:45:04,538 --> 00:45:08,835
just touch her with your forehead and say,

621
00:45:09,035 --> 00:45:11,673
“Mother forgive me for touching you with my feet,”

622
00:45:11,873 --> 00:45:16,067
and She’s your grandmother.
You ask for anything and you will get.

623
00:45:16,439 --> 00:45:19,438
They are all waiting to give you whatever you want.

624
00:45:19,638 --> 00:45:24,082
You can ask the help of Hanumana.
You can ask the help of Ganesha.

625
00:45:24,283 --> 00:45:27,233
The other day the newspaper people told Me,

626
00:45:27,433 --> 00:45:31,580
they are two disciples of Mine who are
correspondents and they were going somewhere

627
00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:33,973
and they had there My photograph with them.

628
00:45:34,174 --> 00:45:38,660
They said, “It was so amazing that we
were coming and while coming driving,

629
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:41,803
our driver just bumped into a truck and we said,

630
00:45:41,903 --> 00:45:44,759
‘We are all finished,’ and we closed our eyes.

631
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:47,828
When we opened our eyes the
truck was ahead and we were here.

632
00:45:48,028 --> 00:45:51,839
We didn’t know how we were saved,
all of us. And the driver had also closed his eyes.

633
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:55,233
We didn’t know how the truck
went that side and how we were here.”

634
00:45:55,958 --> 00:45:59,400
So accidents are avoided.

635
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:02,807
Things can happen, and people have seen.

636
00:46:03,124 --> 00:46:07,295
They live long and you have
good health. Everything is there.

637
00:46:07,495 --> 00:46:11,295
After all, we have to, we have
jumped into the kingdom of God.

638
00:46:11,495 --> 00:46:14,567
Only thing is keep your seeds all right for the time being.

639
00:46:14,767 --> 00:46:17,579
Then the whole thing will be lifted up like this

640
00:46:17,679 --> 00:46:20,592
into satyugaa. Already the satyugaa has started.

641
00:46:22,484 --> 00:46:24,068
[What is the question? – Marathi]

642
00:46:24,269 --> 00:46:28,213
Seeker: If we see all the six chakras nearly

643
00:46:28,753 --> 00:46:34,485
each one there exist some or the other endocrine gland.

644
00:46:39,045 --> 00:46:42,799
What relation this chakra has with this gland?

645
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,666
Shri Mataji: Now endocrine glands
are controlled by the chakras also.

646
00:46:46,867 --> 00:46:51,067
For example, now we can say Mooladhara chakra,

647
00:46:51,267 --> 00:46:53,918
controls this prostate like that.

648
00:46:54,119 --> 00:46:58,644
Even the Agnya chakra controls
the pituitary and pineal, both of them,

649
00:46:58,844 --> 00:47:01,696
and that’s how it controls the ego and super-ego.

650
00:47:01,897 --> 00:47:07,174
So it has a controlling effect on that very
much. They are the growth agents of that.

651
00:47:07,375 --> 00:47:12,188
You see, for example, to control
all the nature God has fixed up the stars.

652
00:47:12,388 --> 00:47:16,343
Certain stars are there, nine, nine stars mostly;

653
00:47:16,543 --> 00:47:21,668
the seven stars, as you know, and
two more are placed there to control,

654
00:47:21,869 --> 00:47:25,057
the Universe and the everything.

655
00:47:25,258 --> 00:47:27,230
It is controlled through those points and

656
00:47:27,430 --> 00:47:31,733
you know so it affects our physical, material life,

657
00:47:32,990 --> 00:47:34,775
the whole planet.

658
00:47:36,402 --> 00:47:42,701
Seeker: Respected Mataji, please give me
the knowledge and show me more clearly the way.

659
00:47:42,902 --> 00:47:45,024
First, what are the vibrations,

660
00:47:45,224 --> 00:47:49,733
[unclear], physiologically, scientifically and spiritually?

661
00:47:49,933 --> 00:47:53,400
Second, where do they, these vibrations come from

662
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:57,186
– from You, cosmos or atmosphere?

663
00:47:57,387 --> 00:48:00,073
What way do the vibrations benefit us?

664
00:48:00,273 --> 00:48:04,225
What are the do’s and don'ts for Sahaja Yoga?

665
00:48:04,426 --> 00:48:09,489
Shri Mataji: Very good question, very
good. Who has asked the question, very.

666
00:48:10,045 --> 00:48:13,827
First question is about what are these vibrations.

667
00:48:14,027 --> 00:48:19,900
I told you yesterday that in
our heart there is a flicker of light

668
00:48:20,496 --> 00:48:23,567
which is burning all the time, which is the Aatma

669
00:48:23,767 --> 00:48:27,567
which is the reflection of Paramatma in our heart.

670
00:48:28,075 --> 00:48:30,628
In short I’ll tell you; the details I will not.

671
00:48:30,886 --> 00:48:33,567
Now what happens, the Kundalini rises,

672
00:48:33,870 --> 00:48:38,567
she opens the Brahmarandhra and
there is the seat of the Sadashiva, the peetha.

673
00:48:38,767 --> 00:48:43,567
You see, the peetha is here, but
Shiva is in the heart reflected as the Aatma.

674
00:48:43,767 --> 00:48:46,884
You see the peetha and the peetha is created

675
00:48:46,984 --> 00:48:50,558
because, you see, the peetha receives the subtle.

676
00:48:50,759 --> 00:48:56,067
You see, it receives the subtle
energy which is all-pervading, the gross.

677
00:48:56,537 --> 00:49:01,922
Inside all the pervading, for
example, this collects My voice.

678
00:49:02,624 --> 00:49:06,122
Voice is a subtle energy which is collected through this.

679
00:49:06,323 --> 00:49:11,453
Here now we have all kinds of
pictures and all kinds of music going on,

680
00:49:11,653 --> 00:49:14,733
but if you have a radio it can capture.

681
00:49:14,966 --> 00:49:17,676
In the same way the peethas are in the brain

682
00:49:17,876 --> 00:49:21,411
and the peetha of the Sadashiva is higher up here

683
00:49:21,611 --> 00:49:28,161
which is opened out so that the subtle,

684
00:49:28,361 --> 00:49:32,658
the sukshama in the gross passes into our heart

685
00:49:32,858 --> 00:49:35,374
through a very subtle channel

686
00:49:35,789 --> 00:49:40,316
and just like a gas light it has a flicker

687
00:49:40,516 --> 00:49:43,823
and when the gas opens out the prakaashsa comes in.

688
00:49:44,195 --> 00:49:49,067
Now the vibrations are, are the,
that prakaasha going through us.

689
00:49:49,267 --> 00:49:51,664
These vibrations start flowing through us.

690
00:49:51,865 --> 00:49:55,233
Now what do I do? You will say, “Mataji what do You do?”

691
00:49:55,433 --> 00:49:59,906
I do nothing but I just try to give you that force

692
00:50:00,106 --> 00:50:03,285
which is the, we can say, the gas power.

693
00:50:03,486 --> 00:50:09,233
That is the gas power because the Kundalini
knows that when I am before you, she rises,

694
00:50:09,433 --> 00:50:11,851
she opens out and it starts flowing.

695
00:50:12,052 --> 00:50:14,265
It is flowing through Me throughout, but unless and

696
00:50:14,365 --> 00:50:16,900
until you are subtle you cannot feel it and you have it.

697
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:21,733
It is, you can say that I am like a,

698
00:50:28,696 --> 00:50:33,233
you can say that I am the finite in the infinite,

699
00:50:33,433 --> 00:50:37,567
or you can say the infinite in the finite;

700
00:50:41,299 --> 00:50:44,223
infinite into the finite

701
00:50:44,423 --> 00:50:49,067
and also the finite into the infinite.

702
00:50:49,267 --> 00:50:50,869
I’m both.

703
00:50:51,449 --> 00:50:52,901
[Did you understood – Marathi]

704
00:50:54,465 --> 00:50:59,900
So the energy that is emitted into all
the subtle energy is passing through Me,

705
00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:04,974
is the Viraat. From the
Viraat, say, the whole thing passes.

706
00:51:05,251 --> 00:51:09,883
It is going into the all-pervading. It is
all-pervading everybody. Everywhere it is going.

707
00:51:10,084 --> 00:51:12,233
Even it is in a cell in everything.

708
00:51:12,433 --> 00:51:17,020
In a carbon atom it is there. Into all
atoms, into all arrangements it is working.

709
00:51:17,221 --> 00:51:20,446
It is the subtle energy that is emitted through Me.

710
00:51:20,647 --> 00:51:24,733
When you become subtle you
become like a radio; you start receiving it.

711
00:51:25,075 --> 00:51:27,067
Now how will you know?

712
00:51:28,178 --> 00:51:32,078
what is correct what is incorrect? You
ask the subtle, and the subtle answers you,

713
00:51:32,278 --> 00:51:36,009
and you get the answers on your hands. It is like that.

714
00:51:36,210 --> 00:51:39,271
So, these are the vibrations which you receive

715
00:51:39,656 --> 00:51:41,993
from the All-pervading Power

716
00:51:42,193 --> 00:51:46,109
and the All-pervading Power is emitted out

717
00:51:47,288 --> 00:51:51,233
and you receive it from Me or from the All-pervading.

718
00:51:51,433 --> 00:51:55,900
It’s just the same from
everywhere these are the vibrations.

719
00:51:56,369 --> 00:52:01,480
But the Self-realization means, which is a
very subtle point, which you try to understand now

720
00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:07,116
that it is so far is an unconscious for you.

721
00:52:07,317 --> 00:52:09,358
Your aatma is in the unconscious.

722
00:52:09,558 --> 00:52:13,400
It is not in your awareness; it is in the achetana.

723
00:52:13,728 --> 00:52:17,368
It is in your unconscious, means it is in the achetana.

724
00:52:17,569 --> 00:52:20,311
You are not yet chetit about it.

725
00:52:20,511 --> 00:52:23,233
You are not aware of it, all right?

726
00:52:23,759 --> 00:52:27,866
But once you are realized
it starts flowing into your awareness,

727
00:52:28,066 --> 00:52:31,128
means you start feeling it in your central nervous system,

728
00:52:31,328 --> 00:52:36,620
because your central nervous
system is your chetna, is your awareness.

729
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:40,386
The human awareness is nothing
but is central nervous system,

730
00:52:40,587 --> 00:52:45,233
but his central nervous system
starts feeling now the vibrations,

731
00:52:45,433 --> 00:52:47,930
the light of the aatma through it.

732
00:52:48,130 --> 00:52:52,614
So that, that is why it is known as
samaadhi. Samaadhi means the unconscious.

733
00:52:52,815 --> 00:52:56,978
When the unconscious becomes the conscious,

734
00:52:57,179 --> 00:52:59,900
it is called as samaadhi.

735
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:03,778
So people think beshudha hone, beshudha nahin.

736
00:53:03,978 --> 00:53:07,374
It means you become aware of the unconscious.

737
00:53:07,574 --> 00:53:10,733
Not only that, but first you become Nirvichaar,

738
00:53:10,933 --> 00:53:15,113
then Nirvikalpa and then a complete Self-realization.

739
00:53:16,145 --> 00:53:19,446
So, the Samaadhi is a word, a great confusion.

740
00:53:19,647 --> 00:53:22,733
Samaadhi just means an universal unconscious.

741
00:53:22,933 --> 00:53:25,900
It means the universal unconscious and unconscious

742
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:57,885
[People think that become
unconscious is samadhi [Unclear] – Marathi].

743
00:53:58,086 --> 00:54:00,855
If you are unconscious in the sense,

744
00:54:01,056 --> 00:54:05,751
now supposing somebody gives you an injection or
you take a drug you become unconscious, means what?

745
00:54:05,952 --> 00:54:08,900
You go into subconscious or into supra-conscious,

746
00:54:09,556 --> 00:54:11,492
but this is a superconsciousness

747
00:54:11,693 --> 00:54:16,185
and superconsciousness, is
all-pervading sarvavyaapi, sukshama.

748
00:54:18,642 --> 00:54:22,400
Yesterday what he told you about three types of saadhnaas:

749
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:26,648
saatvik and raajasik and taamasik.

750
00:54:26,849 --> 00:54:29,654
Taamasik goes to the left side, means into the subconscious

751
00:54:29,854 --> 00:54:33,249
and collective sub-conscious
connected with the libido on the left hand side,

752
00:54:33,450 --> 00:54:38,366
and right side is the supra-
conscious connected with the Pingala naadi

753
00:54:38,566 --> 00:54:41,067
which is the willpower, as you call it,

754
00:54:41,267 --> 00:54:45,733
and connected to the supra-conscious
side, goes to the collective supra-conscious.

755
00:54:46,758 --> 00:54:50,916
Dev and all these people are sitting that
side, Dev, Devtaas and these are officers, you see.

756
00:54:51,117 --> 00:54:53,334
Ganas are on this side on the top,

757
00:54:53,535 --> 00:54:56,567
and all those who fail into that, they go into hell.

758
00:54:56,767 --> 00:54:59,233
But the center is the super-conscious.

759
00:54:59,433 --> 00:55:02,733
For the Sushumna the human
being rise above the super-consciousness.

760
00:55:04,497 --> 00:55:09,567
They gradually start becoming more
and more aware. They have the same body.

761
00:55:09,831 --> 00:55:14,400
For example, if you look at a cell
of the brain, is the same as the cell

762
00:55:16,037 --> 00:55:20,271
of a fat globule, but there is a difference.

763
00:55:20,471 --> 00:55:25,014
So, the difference starts taking, and
by the time you open out from here,

764
00:55:25,214 --> 00:55:29,634
then there is given a greater dimension to that cell, your brain,

765
00:55:31,078 --> 00:55:34,733
that it starts receiving
the vibrations and can understand it.

766
00:55:36,236 --> 00:55:39,900
And then even is a greater,
in Nirvikalpa you get another dimension

767
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:44,233
where you have no doubts; you are knowledge.

768
00:55:45,568 --> 00:55:49,695
And the last is the Self-realization where you are just in joy,

769
00:55:50,401 --> 00:55:53,441
complete in joy, no problems.

770
00:55:53,848 --> 00:55:57,400
You do not catch; nothing happens.

771
00:56:02,261 --> 00:56:07,715
I would say our Vaidya saheb is very
much near Self-realization, very much near.

772
00:56:07,915 --> 00:56:10,900
The way he got his Self-realization itself is remarkable

773
00:56:11,204 --> 00:56:15,567
because he felt two ice cubes
coming into him and melting out,

774
00:56:15,767 --> 00:56:18,212
but he doesn’t catch, you know.

775
00:56:18,462 --> 00:56:22,127
I told him about somebody. He said,
“I know he is no good. He is a tamasic fellow.

776
00:56:22,328 --> 00:56:25,387
Let him go according to his karmas, Mataji. What to do?’

777
00:56:25,588 --> 00:56:29,000
You see, he doesn’t catch, but you people will catch.

778
00:56:31,730 --> 00:56:35,184
[Now the next question is about physiological – Marathi]

779

Physiological, physiological, you can feel
it on the hand. You can feel on the fingers.

Shri Mataji: [What to tell scientifically in this – Marathi]

782
00:56:55,900 --> 00:57:00,624
Scientifically you can say the parasympathetic gets
 activated. You get the control of the parasympathetic.

783
00:57:00,825 --> 00:57:03,567
You jump into the unconscious, the universal unconscious.

Shri Mataji: Now this is the vital force of life.

791
00:57:27,178 --> 00:57:30,400
You see it; it gives you a complete balance.

792

It corrects your physical
being, it corrects your mental being,

it corrects your emotional being,

it gives you a complete spiritual oneness with God

795
00:57:41,933 --> 00:57:44,400
and it integrates you completely.

796
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:48,941
I mean, as far as I am concerned, I have no
pashchataap. I don’t understand what is pashchataap..

797
00:57:49,142 --> 00:57:51,567
I don’t understand what is temptation.

798
00:57:52,219 --> 00:57:55,874
I don’t understand these things
because I am complete one with Myself.

799
00:57:56,074 --> 00:58:01,453
Every, every finger I move, every hand I
move, everything I do, it means something.

800
00:58:01,653 --> 00:58:06,900
I have to do, I mean, it is done without
thinking, but there is a big thought behind it.

801
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:09,733
It is done because I say haan,

802
00:58:10,226 --> 00:58:11,889
I say haan,

803
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:14,470
I say haan.

804
00:58:14,671 --> 00:58:16,690
Haan means there is a noose, you know it.

805
00:58:16,890 --> 00:58:20,596
There is a formation of a circle which works.

806
00:58:20,797 --> 00:58:24,521
Now it’s difficult you know my 
mechanism is different from you.

807
00:58:24,771 --> 00:58:29,639
So I can’t explain what I do because
you don’t have those mechanics within you,

808
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:34,132
but it is like that. Even saying huun, haan, hein,

809
00:58:34,426 --> 00:58:36,636
all these are tremendous words.

810
00:58:36,836 --> 00:58:42,900
They create a kind of a force and
a kind of a whirlwind, we can say.

811
00:58:43,100 --> 00:58:46,567
A kind of a formation takes in which it engulfs

812
00:58:46,767 --> 00:58:52,219
all the bad things that are there or all the
rakshasas and all those things and can pull them out.

813
00:58:52,487 --> 00:58:59,095
Now I gave it in the matka; just I put My breath in that.

814
00:58:59,296 --> 00:59:02,633
It’s pranava itself, complete, and that pranava,

they will be sleeping, will come out

and take out all these things
gradually and bind them and put them inside.

817
00:59:09,754 --> 00:59:11,906
You have seen many mad people are cured like this,

818
00:59:12,106 --> 00:59:14,953
but to look at it looks like matka and people say,

819
00:59:15,153 --> 00:59:17,733
“What is this Mataji is telling
matka matka?” and this and that.

820
00:59:17,933 --> 00:59:22,411
And I have told you about the Civil
Surgeon of Ahmedabad, what happened to him.

821
00:59:22,611 --> 00:59:26,763
He told Me, “I can’t do all these
nonsensical things.” He was so angry.

822
00:59:26,963 --> 00:59:32,160
“You want me to befool me. I can’t listen to all
this.” I said, “All right, you go ahead. I don’t say,”

823
00:59:32,361 --> 00:59:34,506
and he had become little bit loony.

824
00:59:34,706 --> 00:59:38,079
I said, “All right, I don’t say. All right, don’t bring matka,”

825
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:43,391
and third day when I was giving a lecture he
was coming there with such a big matka on his head.

826
00:59:45,026 --> 00:59:49,331
So I said, “Doctor,” after the
lecture. I couldn’t help laugh.

827
00:59:49,532 --> 00:59:52,567
After the lecture I said,
“Why did you bring such a big matka?

828
00:59:52,767 --> 00:59:56,477
I had not asked you to bring such a big
matka. I had asked you to bring such a small matka.”

829
00:59:56,677 --> 01:00:00,900
He said, “Mataji, your maaya. That’s
how you have killed my ego completely

830
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:04,067
because in the market there was no small matka available.

831
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:06,900
Only this big one was available.

832
01:00:10,799 --> 01:00:14,810
So I had to bring such a big matka.”
And he was walking through the whole thing,

833
01:00:15,010 --> 01:00:17,485
and I was looking at him and I didn’t know where to look.

834
01:00:17,685 --> 01:00:20,482
I said, “Look at the Civil
Surgeon,” and that convinced people.

One absolutely one hundred percent sure,

01:03:15,628 --> 01:03:18,433
So, you can imagine what should be the position,

881
01:03:18,633 --> 01:03:22,633
and for fourteen years he had
to lead a complete brahmacharyaa’s life.

882
01:03:22,834 --> 01:03:28,310
He just, She was like his mother. He knew
She was Adi Shakti, but he just saw Her feet.

883
01:03:28,817 --> 01:03:34,094
That should be our case, this thing, that
we should lead a sanctified married life.

884
01:03:34,295 --> 01:03:36,567
Now supposing somebody is married;

885
01:03:36,767 --> 01:03:41,733
then he should not run away with other women, and
the other women should not run away with other men.

886
01:03:41,933 --> 01:03:44,400
And lead a sanctified life,

887
01:03:44,600 --> 01:03:46,833
create a nest of family,

888
01:03:47,033 --> 01:03:51,163
a proper family house, try to adopt, compromise,

889
01:03:51,363 --> 01:03:55,112
adjust, make your wife realize or make your husband realize

890
01:03:55,313 --> 01:03:57,394
and bring peace in the family

891
01:03:57,595 --> 01:04:01,284
because there are many great souls
who want to take birth, many of them.

892
01:04:01,485 --> 01:04:04,567
As soon as you’ll find that such marriages will take place

893
01:04:04,767 --> 01:04:10,233
they’ve seen now in our case, you can ask
some people from we have here. Ask these girls.

894
01:04:10,433 --> 01:04:12,817
There I told them that you must marry.

895
01:04:13,017 --> 01:04:17,108
So, one girl married and she
has a daughter absolutely realized.

896
01:04:17,308 --> 01:04:19,414
So many people have got realized children.

897
01:04:19,614 --> 01:04:20,683
[Marathi].

898
01:04:20,884 --> 01:04:24,567
So many those who got married
like this, they have all realized people.

899
01:04:24,767 --> 01:04:29,233
So, you must try to get a family life, a proper family,

900
01:04:29,433 --> 01:04:31,175
proper relationship.

901
01:04:31,375 --> 01:04:35,866
Do service to your parents, to your
mothers. Don’t find faults with your parents

902
01:04:36,067 --> 01:04:41,810
and try to be kind to them, also to
the kind to the wife’s mother parents also

903
01:04:42,011 --> 01:04:47,227
and try to be good in the family. Try
to bring more peace if they are difficult.

904
01:04:47,427 --> 01:04:52,335
I mean, it’s all right. Don’t spoil the children also.

905
01:04:52,535 --> 01:04:54,994
Correct them, make them loving.

906
01:04:55,534 --> 01:04:59,400
Make a nice society. Every
one of you should be the carrier,

907
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:01,990
of love of your Mother, everywhere.

908
01:05:02,191 --> 01:05:05,829
That is one thing, If you are Sahaja yogis

909
01:05:06,029 --> 01:05:08,576
and if you change and transform in your behavior,

910
01:05:08,777 --> 01:05:14,094
naturally Sahaja Yoga will have its own
reputation and everybody will start taking to Sahaja Yoga.

911
01:05:14,295 --> 01:05:17,290
[Doing Sahaj yoga & smuggling doing
is no good. It will not happen – Marathi]

912
01:05:17,490 --> 01:05:19,287
Impossible.

913
01:05:20,366 --> 01:05:22,227
If you do anything like that,

914
01:05:22,427 --> 01:05:24,406
immediately your vibrations will go away.

915
01:05:24,606 --> 01:05:27,835
There was a gentleman in America, who got realization,

916
01:05:28,035 --> 01:05:32,236
and he started an ashram
of Sahaja Yoga, started taking money.

917
01:05:32,436 --> 01:05:36,067
When he came here people told Me,
“Mataji, we get a chakker with this man.

918
01:05:36,267 --> 01:05:39,754
What’s wrong with him, You tell me.”
Immediately in meditation I knew what was it is.

919
01:05:39,954 --> 01:05:42,656
I said, “Give Me the pamphlet.” He gave Me the pamphlet.

920
01:05:42,856 --> 01:05:44,840
I said, “You can’t earn money.

921
01:05:45,041 --> 01:05:50,322
If you earn money you’ll have a bad time,” and he
had a very bad time after that and he had earlier also.

922
01:05:50,522 --> 01:05:52,067
Now he’s all right.

923
01:05:52,267 --> 01:05:56,684
He says, “I will do some other work.”
You cannot earn any money from Sahaja Yoga.

924
01:05:56,885 --> 01:06:02,067
Do not have Sahaja yogis for business
partnership. No, they are Sahaja yogis.

925
01:06:02,267 --> 01:06:04,766
Do not use Sahaja Yoga for making money,

926
01:06:04,967 --> 01:06:08,091
[Someone stole pair of shoes the other day – Marathi].

927
01:06:08,292 --> 01:06:12,651
You see, this kind of this limit, this
type of people can never be Sahaja yogis.

928
01:06:12,751 --> 01:06:17,235
You have to be generous people.
You have to be absolutely honest

929
01:06:18,408 --> 01:06:27,674
[Someone stole my things. It is a 
nonsense. Are you to theft? – Marathi].

930
01:06:27,903 --> 01:06:33,900
They are thieves. They just come here for thieving.
They are not Sahaja yogis. So such people are also there.

931
01:06:34,100 --> 01:06:39,676
[They take pair of shoes – Marathi]

932
01:06:39,877 --> 01:06:42,858
This should not be done. There
are Ten Commandments, as you say,

933
01:06:43,059 --> 01:06:47,757
and you should not take anybody’s
things, and be satisfied in your heart.

934
01:06:47,958 --> 01:06:52,148
This is a very simple way of doing
things, but you have to lead a chaste life

935
01:06:52,348 --> 01:06:54,982
and you have to also see chaste things.

936
01:06:55,182 --> 01:07:00,067
For example, [Bad movies is not good - Marathi]
you will not like it also. Your priorities will change.

937
01:07:00,267 --> 01:07:03,643
Your friends will change gradually.
You will not like dirty jokes, nothing.

938
01:07:03,843 --> 01:07:06,067
You’ll just change and you’ll run away from them.

939
01:07:06,267 --> 01:07:11,400
I’ve seen these foreigners; now they are telling
Me that they just cannot stand all these things now.

940
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:15,135
Once upon a time whatever they
could tolerate and enjoy also sometimes,

941
01:07:15,335 --> 01:07:19,400
they just cannot stand it and bear
it because now you have become saintly.

942
01:07:19,684 --> 01:07:21,900
You have to be decent people.

943
01:07:23,382 --> 01:07:37,323
[No need to do politics. Unclear] – Marathi]

944
01:07:37,823 --> 01:07:41,382
So don’t dabble into all these rumors and frivolous things.

945
01:07:41,582 --> 01:07:44,900
Don’t waste your precious life. You
are Sahaja yogis. Not a single moment,

946
01:07:45,100 --> 01:07:47,341
to be wasted on all nonsensical things.

947
01:07:47,541 --> 01:07:50,259
Every moment should be spent in,

948
01:07:50,459 --> 01:07:54,608
having dignity for yourself, for others, for loving others.

949
01:07:54,808 --> 01:07:57,644
[If someone wants something give it to them – Marathi].

950
01:07:57,844 --> 01:08:02,706
Don’t be misers at all. Miserly
people are against Sahaja Yoga,

951
01:08:02,907 --> 01:08:05,257
and if miserly people come I give them trouble.

952
01:08:05,458 --> 01:08:09,567
If you are miserly you get lots of troubles.
So you don’t get miserly, haan, I’m telling you

953
01:08:09,823 --> 01:08:11,804
and don’t be too talkative also,

954
01:08:12,005 --> 01:08:15,088
become too talkative and
troublesome. I can stop your talking,

955
01:08:15,288 --> 01:08:17,474
and if you don’t talk at all that’s also not good.

956
01:08:17,674 --> 01:08:21,916
Means don’t go to extremes of anything.
These are certain things which you have to know.

957
01:08:22,117 --> 01:08:26,017
And don’t, women should not dress up like
men, and men should not behave like women.

958
01:08:26,217 --> 01:08:28,567
All these nonsenses you 
should not do. You should be yourself.

959
01:08:28,767 --> 01:08:34,016
Supposing you are something in something you
are doing you should wear the dresses as you are;

960
01:08:34,216 --> 01:08:37,560
now no need to wear funny dresses and go round and

961
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:40,925
have your hair up to this much or try to show off.

962
01:08:41,125 --> 01:08:44,466
You see, all these are mythical things. Be normal, natural people

963
01:08:44,667 --> 01:08:48,760
and lead a normal, natural, decent life, and it’s not so important.

964
01:08:48,961 --> 01:08:53,067
Food is not so important. Whatever you get you get you eat,

965
01:08:53,267 --> 01:08:58,351
and don’t talk too much of comfort and
don’t also sleep on the thorns, no, no, no,

966
01:08:58,552 --> 01:09:00,809
but don’t be absolutely a waster.

967
01:09:01,009 --> 01:09:04,000
Be in the center; is a very simple thing for Sahaja yogis.

968
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:06,901
And you see with your
vibrations if you have to take a decision,

969
01:09:07,101 --> 01:09:09,639
“Should I take this house or not?” Take the vibrations.

970
01:09:09,839 --> 01:09:11,567
Anything you see,

971
01:09:12,659 --> 01:09:16,900
“What should I do? Should I have,
who should I have as a Prime Minister?”

972
01:09:17,100 --> 01:09:19,944
Now, see for yourself whom do
you want to have a Prime Minister.

973
01:09:20,144 --> 01:09:24,510
See four people you put in; see the vibrations.
Who has the best? Now, you think of the person.

974
01:09:24,711 --> 01:09:29,067
He will not be the one the Prime
Minister. You cannot say that he will be

975
01:09:29,267 --> 01:09:31,865
because maybe that there are so many horrible people.

976
01:09:32,065 --> 01:09:37,290
In a democracy anybody can be brought in
but the one, who is a good one, is a Sahaja yogi.

977
01:09:37,490 --> 01:09:39,501
He should be the Prime Minister, and you should ask.

978
01:09:39,701 --> 01:09:42,490
If the more people ask for it, he may be.

979
01:09:43,133 --> 01:09:47,408
So, decide everything with vibrations,
for yourself, for collectiveness or anything,

980
01:09:47,609 --> 01:09:51,045
and the most important is you give it to others.

981
01:09:51,246 --> 01:09:54,233
And Sahaja Yoga doesn’t work in your houses, families,

982
01:09:54,433 --> 01:10:01,063
or in small little groups but it works here in Bhartiya
Vidya Bhavan when all of you are here because I’m here.

983
01:10:01,358 --> 01:10:06,400
It is a collective work. All of you are cells of one body,

984
01:10:06,853 --> 01:10:11,400
and the more cells are
awakened, the more the body is active.

985
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:14,400
So, you have to come together, to be together.

986
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:18,508
Love each other. Mix up with
others. Do not form groups, no.

987
01:10:18,708 --> 01:10:23,900
You should talk to each other very freely,
whatever is your language, nationality or whatever it is.

988
01:10:24,334 --> 01:10:27,028
And you should mix up with others; is not proper,

989

is a sense of insecurity is expressed if you have a group

Foreigners are sitting together in a group like that.

994
01:10:44,827 --> 01:10:48,863
You see what I’m saying: there should be no grouping done; no need.

995
01:10:49,434 --> 01:10:52,233
Be open. All of us,

996

all of us are born of one Mother, we should
not feel insecure, we should be not together.

997
01:10:58,782 --> 01:11:01,733
It is not that you should
avoid also, if you are together all right,

01:11:01,933 --> 01:11:04,400
now together is all right we are all brothers and sisters.

999
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:08,847
Be very friendly and kind and
do not analyze others and criticize others.

1000
01:11:09,048 --> 01:11:12,765
Better to criticize yourself than to analyze others.

1001
01:11:12,966 --> 01:11:15,947
Will sit down, “He’s like this because like that.”

We should watch ourselves and not others. Why
somebody is behaving like that, you just don’t worry.

1004
01:11:28,228 --> 01:11:33,553

And that’s how with love, patience, understanding,

I’m sure one day we all will feel the
oneness, all of us, and we should help each other.

1007

So, you should not sort of identify with yourself.

1015

You should identify yourself with
the eternal life that is within you

01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:48,958
Even if the car is not there we are there. We are not lost.

1023
01:12:49,307 --> 01:12:54,604
So don’t think of the future, don’t think of
the past but think of the present and enjoy.

1024
01:12:54,804 --> 01:12:57,400
That is the message of Sahaja Yoga,

1025
01:12:58,732 --> 01:13:02,067
and perhaps I’ve covered most of the points for you people,

1026
01:13:02,267 --> 01:13:06,900
and never try to criticize anyone, never, never, never.

1027
01:13:07,100 --> 01:13:11,311
And be firm and know that you have just now crossed,

1028
01:13:11,512 --> 01:13:14,497
so many of you just crossed. So be steady, steadily

1029
01:13:14,697 --> 01:13:17,733
[Look at front –Marathi] what is
going to happen, let us see. Let us see.

1030
01:13:17,933 --> 01:13:20,992
Be with that. Suddenly, don’t be bumptious about it

1031
01:13:21,192 --> 01:13:25,587
and otherwise you’ll be rippled back again,
you see. So gradually grope the whole thing.

1032
01:13:25,787 --> 01:13:28,233
When you have got the mastery over it then grip it.

1033
01:13:28,433 --> 01:13:30,898
But if you are bumptious, anybody can push you down

1034
01:13:31,099 --> 01:13:33,636
saying that [It is not good –Marathi].

1035
01:13:33,837 --> 01:13:35,900
There are many like that. So be careful.

1036
01:13:36,100 --> 01:13:39,948
You see, everybody is trying to push you
down. In this world there are satanic forces,

1037
01:13:40,148 --> 01:13:45,024
and you are very special chosen
people. That’s why you have got vibrations.

1038
01:13:45,224 --> 01:13:48,067
There are so many people in
Bombay but how many have felt it?

1039
01:13:48,267 --> 01:13:50,214
You are the very few who have felt it.

1040
01:13:50,415 --> 01:13:54,457
So be careful about it and
meet together in this same number.

1041
01:13:54,657 --> 01:14:00,900
All of you can be realized fully
if you come together and sit together.

1042
01:14:01,244 --> 01:14:05,319
They say when Mataji is here, they are
here. Then Mataji is only busy all of the time.

1043
01:14:05,519 --> 01:14:10,400
[That’s why I didn’t came to Mumbai this
time. Mataji is curing everyone’s catches – Marathi]

1044
01:14:10,947 --> 01:14:14,400
Those eight or ten people who
have been attending it regularly

1045
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:17,900
are the best and they are also busy cleaning you

1046
01:14:18,859 --> 01:14:31,692
[Don’t do like that. Put on one day Tuesday.
Today is the last day. I will come back – Marathi].

1047
01:14:32,093 --> 01:14:34,093
Today is the last day

1048
01:14:34,918 --> 01:14:38,067
because I’m going on the 25th evening.

1049
01:14:40,069 --> 01:14:44,786
I’ll be back again in December,
I hope so, for one or two days.

1050
01:14:44,986 --> 01:14:47,567
We’ll have a program, not a long program

1051
01:14:47,767 --> 01:14:50,229
because we are going on a holiday?

1052
01:14:50,430 --> 01:14:52,791
First time in My husband’s life.

1053
01:14:52,991 --> 01:14:55,058
So, I hope you won’t mind.

1054
01:14:55,356 --> 01:14:57,733
Then again I’ll come back next summer

1055
01:14:57,933 --> 01:15:01,705
perhaps I don’t know maybe or maybe

1056
01:15:02,268 --> 01:15:04,990
next year I may not come.

1057
01:15:06,437 --> 01:15:12,206
By that time, I hope you people will keep to the program...
