00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.160
Now the worst enemy of collectivity is aggressiveness.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.040
Some people are basically aggressive;

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.320
their style of talking is extremely aggressive.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.120
The way they say things is aggressive,

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.000
maybe because anything, maybe they are better educated,

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:31.080
maybe they come from a very aggressive family,

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:36.440
maybe they are having a kind of a superiority complex

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.400
or an inferiority complex or a sense of insecurity,

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.520
or maybe they are possessed.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.080
They try to dominate and show their very strong

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:55.080
feelings towards people of superiority.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.480
They may be inferior, it's not necessary, but they do

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.720
and this is something is to be curbed.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:09.080
So what you have to practice here is humility:

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.920
try to be humble.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.960
There was a joke like this, that

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.320
one gentleman was going on the staircase

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.600
and another was coming from the top.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.680
So this gentleman who was going up there

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.920
said to the other that, "Please move."

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.480
So he said, "l don't move for fools."

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.920
The person who was climbing up, he said,

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.680
"But I do" and he moved out.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.000
That's how the humility works.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:52.160
You have to be humble in your approach to others.
