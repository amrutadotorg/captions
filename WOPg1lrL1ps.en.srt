1
00:00:06,381 --> 00:00:15,431
My father was a brilliant man. He was leader
of the people who were fighting the British.

2
00:00:16,172 --> 00:00:23,112
Very learned, very learned man. He went 
to jail many a times. Last time, when he

3
00:00:23,112 --> 00:00:30,221
went after 1942 movement, it was for
three years regularly he was in jail.

4
00:00:31,405 --> 00:00:37,445
But there was one fellow who was a friend
of My father, he came and told My mother

5
00:00:37,445 --> 00:00:44,146
that you must apologize because we don't
want your husband to be in jail, he has so

6
00:00:44,146 --> 00:00:51,012
many children and this and that. My mother
said, "I can't do that. His will. He wants

7
00:00:51,012 --> 00:00:59,878
to go to jail, he has to go." Like that, 
you see, we have glimpses of very ideal

8
00:00:59,878 --> 00:01:06,291
type of people during that time. They didn't
think of money, their properties, nothing.

9
00:01:07,286 --> 00:01:13,136
So, sacrifice was immense. Nowadays
we can't even think of such a thing.

10
00:01:14,444 --> 00:01:21,184
But I did feel that the English should leave
our country. They have no right to be there.

11
00:01:22,966 --> 00:01:28,126
So, I did feel that somebody has to tell
them that this is wrong. So, I had a great

12
00:01:28,126 --> 00:01:34,975
sense of right and wrong but I didn't 
know it was Spirituality. It was a innate

13
00:01:34,975 --> 00:01:41,136
quality (with)in Me. But most of the people,
in those days were like that, in India

14
00:01:41,478 --> 00:01:49,588
because the urge for freedom was so great
and that people were fighting for freedom,

15
00:01:50,025 --> 00:01:58,295
so they could not think of all those 
things. Once I had to speak when I was

16
00:01:58,295 --> 00:02:06,709
7 years of age, for Mahatma Gandhi's 
fasting and I spoke to thousands of people

17
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:17,688
I was a little girl and I told them how we
should forget about caste system and how

18
00:02:17,688 --> 00:02:22,516
we should marry each other.
I was such a little girl as 7 years.
