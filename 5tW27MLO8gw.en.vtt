00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.780
The sea must be worshipped

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.500
It's quite cold.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.820
Have you been there?

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.400
Just going down to it Mother.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.820
All right, you go with him.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.200
This the 30th of December, 1985

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.200
Come along

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.200
What about my chappals?

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.200
Are these my chappals?

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.200
No.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.040
You had your bath?

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.400
Sea bath, you got it?

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.760
I was going to go but Rustom took me by force in the canteen.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.240
It's getting quite cold.

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.760
Such a good sport, you know?

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:31.760
Yes, Mother.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.920
I guess [inaudible]

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.380
The dream, Shri Mataji, that we had last year of coming to Ganapatipule

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:57.600
[Hindi]

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.880
You’ve come without any reputation

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.500
I got the balance with us [unsure].

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:23.140
She's all right.

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:24.900
She's all right and she has,

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.700
she has accepted.

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.700
I think he was a little shorter than what she thought.

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.200
She has three children what is she accepting?

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:33.800
Yes, yes, yes.

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:37.200
I just don’t understand with three children, this, that nonsense.

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.140
[Hindi]

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.260
They should all go to UK.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.900
She’ll get some from Lucknow Shri Mataji.

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.160
Lucknow.

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:17.200
It's such a nice woman.

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:18.700
So, now,

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:20.700
She said "no".

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:26.240
And we haven't got any info from her since.

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:33.260
John Noyce is here, what he is saying?

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:35.740
He's here but we haven't got anyw word from him.

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:37.740
No, no, why he is late?

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:39.760
John Noyce is here?

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:43.280
There are other [inaudible] if we can get him.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:47.840
John Noyce is an Australian?

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:50.720
This is the tall guy here.

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:51.520
Yes.

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.100
Shri Mataji, that's the first choice that You had for her.

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:55.240
Who's that?

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:56.380
John Noyce.

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:58.380
Then what did she say?

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:01.480
She said nothing, truly, I wonder why, why-

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:03.460
It had gone off.

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:04.560
I don't know.

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.560
They thought, somebody told Me, she doesn't want.

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:11.120
Shri Mataji, maybe that John Noyce wants her to go to Australia.

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:12.560
He wants her to go to Australia.

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:13.900
Who's that?

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:15.900
John Noyce.

00:09:57.820 --> 00:10:00.060
You get good televisions in India. Thank you.

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:03.040
I know but he’s critic about what we do.

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:06.180
I had to bring him with me, because these people, you see,

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:08.640
I don't know they put already made dust in it

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:10.480
to make it [inaudible]

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:12.340
Why try such a trick? I don’t understand.

00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:16.500
This fellow; there’s one fellow who's called Marlow.

00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:18.040
He’s so negative!

00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:57.540
The person who was there. He said, " ... I can get

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:09.560
You can say it in English, Shri Mataji.

00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:13.760
?

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:15.760
It is like a country.

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:20.400
The custom officer ?

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:22.400
She didn't get me a visa.

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:27.440
That’s a fact, I mean, I have no time to think of such things.

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:29.440
While this is English mind.

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:31.960
Never go straight.

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:35.680
I would say that they have a loose angle

00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:44.700
I have to tell them.

00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:46.980
They cannot think straight.

00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:48.980
You got it?

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:50.500
They cannot be sincere.

00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:55.260
They are not sincere people. They have no heart.

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:04.620
But especially that fellow who has done it, he’s a very crooked fellow.

00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:08.520
And he had been taking drugs, this, that.

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:15.760
...Study.

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:17.760
Ah, very good!

00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:19.580
Can I read now?

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:20.580
No, later

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:22.400
I can read.

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:23.320
Yes, yes.

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:26.560
You have to Dedicate yourself completely to me,

00:12:26.565 --> 00:12:28.725
not to Sahaja Yoga, but to me.

00:12:29.155 --> 00:12:31.695
Sahaja Yoga is just one of my aspects.

00:12:32.025 --> 00:12:34.815
Leaving everything, you have to dedicate.

00:12:34.865 --> 00:12:36.525
Complete dedication,

00:12:36.525 --> 00:12:39.365
otherwise you cannot ascend any further.

00:12:39.365 --> 00:12:41.295
Without questioning, without arguing.

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:46.040
Dedication is the easiest way to get rid of all your angularities,

00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:49.120
all your problems, all your badhas.

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:53.440
Complete dedication, is the only way you can grow further.

00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:55.120
Krishna said,

00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:59.060
‘Sarva dharmanam parityajya, mamekam sharanam vraja’.

00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:01.460
Forget all the religion of the world (dharma).

00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:04.240
There is no difference between him and me

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:06.220
but today I am the one,

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:09.120
I am the one who has given you Realization.

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:12.780
All these dharmas are to be given up entirely,

00:13:13.345 --> 00:13:16.165
and you have to surrender fully from your heart.

00:13:16.535 --> 00:13:19.135
Here, as you are before me today,

00:13:19.135 --> 00:13:21.335
I want to tell you very frankly,

00:13:21.745 --> 00:13:24.335
as Krishna had told only Arjuna,

00:13:24.335 --> 00:13:27.435
‘Sarva dharmanam parityajya, mamekam sharanam vraja’.

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:29.300
Shri Krishna has said,

00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:32.800
"Give up all your dharmas and surrender them to me,

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:34.100
surrender to my dharma only."

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:36.860
"You should only know what you owe to me."

00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:38.600
meaning the Divinity.

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:42.040
Now Shri Krishna is not there, it’s me who is Shri Krishna,

00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:44.740
so you must know what you owe to Me.

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:48.800
She can be achieved through bhakti.

00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:51.960
She can only be achieved through dedication.

00:13:52.905 --> 00:13:55.855
She’s only fond of her bhaktas, the devotees.

00:13:56.435 --> 00:13:59.545
For this, meditation is the only way I should say.

00:13:59.805 --> 00:14:02.955
Emotionally you may feel closer to me in your heart.

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:06.260
But through meditation, surrender.

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:10.520
Meditation is nothing but surrendering, is complete surrendering.

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:15.180
In your full freedom, complete freedom, you have to surrender.

00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:18.240
And only through your bhakti,

00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:20.080
through your devotion and dedication,

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:21.560
you can achieve me.

00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:26.000
My achievement is the complete manifestation of your Divine powers.

00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:32.880
It’s very simple, made so simple.

00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:36.680
I’m only pleased by people who are simple,

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:38.940
innocent, who are not tricky,

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:42.160
who are loving, affectionate to each other.

00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:44.400
It’s very easy to please me.

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:47.080
When I see you loving each other,

00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:51.540
talking good of each other, helping each other, respecting each other,

00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:55.960
laughing aloud together, enjoying together each other’s company,

00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:58.900
I get my blessing, my first joy.

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:02.500
So, the dedication in meditation,

00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:06.780
complete dedication in meditation, must be practiced.

00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:11.780
It’s not for your good now you are doing it, so-called ‘your’.

00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:14.200
First you were a little baby, a small thing;

00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:17.680
now you are that collective being,

00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:21.500
you are not doing anything for yourself, but for that collective being.

00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:24.620
You are growing to be aware of that whole

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:26.680
which you are going to become.

00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:30.000
Your jobs, your money, your wives,

00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:33.600
your husbands, your children, your father, mother, relations,

00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:36.280
these considerations are over now.

00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:40.660
You all have to take up the responsibility of Sahaja Yoga.

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:43.660
Every one of you is quite capable.

00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:46.640
You are brought up for that.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.400
In dedication, in complete devotion, you have to do it

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:54.315
now, not for your own gain, for your own achievement,

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:55.980
that is over now.

00:15:56.340 --> 00:15:58.860
It’s for completely getting out of the mire

00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:04.600
and standing on the land, singing aloud the praise of your Father.

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:06.740
You have to bear the brunt,

00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:08.560
and the sacrifice,

00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:11.060
which are no more sacrifices to you

00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:13.720
because Spirit gives, it never sacrifices.

00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:19.740
Its quality is to give. So, you don’t sacrifice, you just give.

00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:22.680
Today, one more lecture Mother?

00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:24.680
Yes, yes. It's coming out well.

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:28.200
Our greatest possession.

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:31.540
The greatest possession you have is your Mother.

00:16:32.615 --> 00:16:35.485
Through her you have your brothers and sisters.

00:16:36.235 --> 00:16:38.945
Now the name of your Mother is very powerful.

00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:43.460
You know that is the most powerful name than all other names,

00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:47.460
the most powerful name. But you must know how to take it.

00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:53.000
With that complete dedication you have to take that name.

00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:57.460
I have taken birth in this world in the binding of Sahaja Yogis

00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:01.440
and have been moving around only in their binding.

00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:04.240
I am desireless

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:07.540
and hence my everything depends upon your desires.

00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:11.520
Attain Me; I am yours! I am for you.

00:17:12.340 --> 00:17:17.240
I have given you that which has been beyond the reach of very great sages and saints.

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:22.760
When I’m speaking it is a mantra, when I’m not speaking, is a mantra flowing.

00:17:23.860 --> 00:17:28.100
Those who are fanatically adhering to me are also not correct.

00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:31.140
There should be no fanaticism about it.

00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:33.260
But the ideal one important thing.

00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:41.320
He’s a real income tax man!

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:51.580
Come to tax my income you see!

00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:58.720
I have read it in order to show who is the true ideal.

00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:04.980
That a Sahaja Yogi is happy in the circumstances that are prevailing.

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:10.920
If he is not, then his satisfaction is superficial and not from within.

00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:14.700
A river starts with a very small little drop,

00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:19.120
and then it expands, expands, expands, expands.

00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:29.120
When you become the parents and then you enjoy other children as much as you enjoy your child,

00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:31.780
then your generosity has started.

00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:36.820
You have to be a peaceful person, not an aggressive person.

00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:39.820
The person who is peaceful is powerful

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:44.440
the one who doesn’t react to anything else, is the most powerful.

00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:47.700
You have to be kind to others.

00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:50.520
You have to be neat and clean.

00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:55.660
First is forgiveness, second the detachment leading to compassion.

00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:59.860
These are the wheels of your chariot which moves you.

00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:04.920
You have been made like temples. Keep it clean.

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:09.180
We are moving towards the soothing qualities of the Spirit.

00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:13.800
You have to ‘soothe’ the others and not to excite, but to soothe.

00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:18.100
Let God’s melodies be sounded from your flutes.

00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:22.540
You must have the capacity to deepen your meditative power,

00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:26.360
so that these ideals go and settle in your heart,

00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:29.040
as a part and parcel of your being.

00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:34.480
Once the saints know this is the principle on which we have to live,

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:36.580
they become one with the principles.

00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:43.780
these are principles on which we have to live are there.

00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:46.460
You become the mother,

00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:50.800
and you, whatever you are which has to grow, is the child.

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:55.980
If you are a Sahaja Yogi you have to be a flower,

00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:59.860
and a strong flower, and an eternal flower

00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:03.280
that always grows, does not fade out,

00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:05.760
always growing, never fades,

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:07.560
such a flower you have to be.

00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:11.640
Sahaja Yogis should never be angry.

00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:18.260
If somebody has to tell you

00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:20.700
that you must organize go fast

00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:24.180
and hold back and do not feel bad.

00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:26.555
We have to do so much work in this world.

00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:28.600
We have no time to waste.

00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:32.080
Truly keep the maryadas in Sahaja Yoga

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:37.220
same morning and evening that, "I am a Sahaja Yogi", nobody can harm you,

00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:41.020
hurt you, nobody can trouble you.

00:20:41.435 --> 00:20:43.140
On the contrary,

00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:44.845
you will be enjoying life

00:20:44.925 --> 00:20:46.695
if you keep to the maryadas.

00:20:47.785 --> 00:20:49.815
One must promise to God that,

00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:52.560
"We’ll know about Sahaja Yoga

00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:54.680
through proper understanding

00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:56.840
reading every word of it.

00:20:57.525 --> 00:20:59.965
We’ll master the knowledge of Sahaja Yoga.

00:21:00.495 --> 00:21:02.385
We will keep ourselves clean

00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:06.640
and completely surrender ourselves, our lives to Sahaja Yoga."

00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:11.240
Surrendering to Sahaja Yoga is actually surrendering to joy,

00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:13.320
bliss and peace.

00:21:14.735 --> 00:21:16.605
Language should be sweet.

00:21:16.965 --> 00:21:18.815
Your behaviour should be good.

00:21:19.295 --> 00:21:21.145
You should be very gentle and soft;

00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:25.200
you should move like a Yogi, live like a saint.

00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:28.220
And people should see through you

00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:30.060
the greatness of Sahaja Yoga.

00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:32.480
See the trees

00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:36.420
when they get their flowers, they are not so respectful.

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:39.980
But when they are laden by the fruits

00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:41.860
they bow down to Mother Earth.

00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:43.460
In the same way

00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:46.000
when you have got the fruits of Sahaja Yoga,

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000
you all must bow down.

00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:50.600
You have to be sensitive to God

00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:52.960
and not to bad things.

00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:56.340
You have to change your methods.

00:21:56.340 --> 00:21:58.740
The person who cannot change his methods

00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:00.540
cannot spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:03.740
Because he sticks to only to one way.

00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:05.740
with which people get bored.

00:22:06.045 --> 00:22:07.595
You should find new ways.

00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:10.720
An established Sahaja Yogi is the one

00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:13.840
who becomes completely one with God

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:15.800
and wins him over.

00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:17.940
He has to do everything for that.

00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:20.140
This is how is a true Sahaja Yogi.

00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:33.100
How to keep Mother pleased.

00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:37.000
That’s me, so that I know!

00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:41.680
So, how to please Mother?

00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:44.640
I am also a simple person

00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:48.500
so I want a simple-hearted person.

00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:57.000
So, this Heart Chakra is to be first looked after.

00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:01.520
That with your heart - desire, you will keep your Mother pleased.

00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:08.335
First of all, your heart must be clear.

00:23:08.335 --> 00:23:10.145
If the heart is not clear,

00:23:10.145 --> 00:23:13.880
then everything has no meaning because it is a “dark heart”

00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:17.400
which is doing all these things.

00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:20.260
The heart has to be clean, absolutely surrendered

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:23.820
and must try to put me before everything else.

00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:28.360
The Lakshmi tattva has to become Mahalakshmi tattva.

00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:31.140
That is for your ascent.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.100
And just to get into the Mahalakshmi tattva

00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:40.460
what you have to do is to use all your material things

00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:43.740
and your material being in such a way

00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:45.640
that you please me.

00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:48.720
Bapre, give me horrible things, all right.

00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:50.700
You have to keep your Mother pleased

00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:53.300
You have to keep your Mother pleased by pleasing other Sahaja Yogis

00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:55.620
and not other people.

00:23:57.100 --> 00:24:01.440
What guru dakshinat have you given me?

00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:06.960
Understand that your money is not worth the dust

00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:10.140
on the feet of your Mother Guru.

00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:13.160
You should give your hearts,

00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:16.200
only clean and holy hearts.

00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:19.520
You must clean your physical beings.

00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:23.420
You must get up early in the morning

00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:26.640
and spend at least one hour on meditation and worshipping.

00:24:26.985 --> 00:24:30.015
Perform "Aarti" and meditation in the evening.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.000
I'll read about laws of the Divine.

00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:38.980
One must know

00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:41.220
these laws of the Divine,

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.880
that you have to live with self-respect

00:24:45.215 --> 00:24:46.865
that we have to be chaste.

00:24:47.725 --> 00:24:49.585
that we have to have dignity,

00:24:50.155 --> 00:24:53.375
that we cannot steal money and steal things

00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:56.300
and be parasites.

00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:59.020
That we cannot kill others

00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:01.200
and we cannot beat others

00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:03.220
and say harsh things,

00:25:03.820 --> 00:25:05.360
they are just the same.

00:25:06.220 --> 00:25:09.340
And that we have respect,

00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:12.340
the respect for all that is sublime.

00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:15.160
Respect for all the saints

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.920
that are Sahaja Yogis.

00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:21.340
And the respect for the leaders who represent you Mother.

00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:25.000
With all this, we are very different people.

00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:26.660
We are different race.

00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:28.600
We are virtuous,

00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:29.960
we are righteous

00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:32.280
and we are proud to be that way.

00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:34.400
We are sure of everything.

00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:36.440
We know about every thing.

00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:38.840
And we are personification of Compassion,

00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:40.600
of Love of God.

00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:42.460
That’s what we are.

00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:44.680
We are not ordinary people.

00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:48.080
On the subtler side is compassion is forgiveness

00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:49.580
is love.

00:25:50.405 --> 00:25:53.385
But the greatest of all is service to God.

00:25:53.615 --> 00:25:55.405
We are doing the work of God.

00:25:55.825 --> 00:25:57.325
How can we be tired?

00:25:58.005 --> 00:26:00.345
The dynamic is flowing through us,

00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:03.180
that compassion is so fulfilling,

00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:06.600
that love is so beautifying

00:26:06.765 --> 00:26:09.325
that how can we not do it?

00:26:09.485 --> 00:26:11.925
God has created this universe,

00:26:11.925 --> 00:26:14.175
this world and you people

00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:17.800
out of this compassion only, just his compassion.

00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:20.960
Beautiful!

00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:24.640
I think it’s come out well Mother.

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:25.920
Very well!

00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:29.640
It just shows how subtly you are an income tax fellow!

00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:33.820
Really, you’ve done very well, very well.

00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:36.175
But actually, what I feel, that when,

00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:37.940
out of context people read it, you see,

00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:41.360
it might look little bit too much.

00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:43.620
But I will read it only to Sahaja Yogis.

00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:45.380
Yes, then it’s all right.

00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:46.820
Sahaja Yogis, they’ll be happy to hear that.

00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:50.380
Very happy, in one place the essence is there, on many topics.

00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:52.115
But for others, you see,

00:26:52.115 --> 00:26:55.265
they might get a shock, because when I speak,

00:26:55.265 --> 00:26:58.260
I always cover it with some chocolates, you see.

00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:00.720
So, the Castrol is going in straight forward.

00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:03.760
But Sahaja Yogis, they love to have Castrol

00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:05.440
direct.

00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:08.800
It’s all right, as long as it doesn’t go into the hands of others

00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:10.540
it’s perfectly all right.

00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:19.120
"With Shri Mataji on the beach"

00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:05.040
Shri Mataji, please, tell us something for our record.

00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:05.820
Hum?

00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:08.440
Please, tell us something for our record, here.

00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:09.340
For what?

00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:10.720
For our record.

00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:13.960
So, you’ve come on the beach for the first time during this trip.

00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:14.600
Yes.

00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:19.280
You see the sea is the Father,

00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:21.540
is the Guru

00:29:22.780 --> 00:29:24.460
and he must be worshipped

00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:30.080
before you do any puja, Guru must to be worshipped.

00:29:31.780 --> 00:29:35.880
First the Shri Ganesha and then the Guru has to be worshipped.

00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:39.840
That’s why I came to the sea,

00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:41.760
so you all learnt

00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:43.800
that you all have to worship the sea

00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:46.060
and not to spoil things like this.

00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:47.260
See now:

00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:49.260
That’s not a good idea.

00:29:49.340 --> 00:29:51.180
You should never spoil a sea shore.

00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:54.660
That’s your Father’s altar, it should not be spoiled.

00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:56.100
And

00:29:56.635 --> 00:29:57.635
also,

00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:00.540
to wear funny dresses

00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:05.560
and misbehave in the presence of your Guru is inauspicious.

00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:07.400
One should not do like that.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:12.420
But I don’t know how many understand the importance of the sea.

00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:16.360
If you behave like this, the sea goes angry

00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:17.960
then you have lots of problems.

00:30:18.855 --> 00:30:19.855
Like,

00:30:20.695 --> 00:30:23.775
it may never be a sunny day for you to come to the sea.

00:30:23.965 --> 00:30:24.965
Or maybe,

00:30:25.315 --> 00:30:28.215
on every holiday it will be a clouded day.

00:30:29.005 --> 00:30:30.045
Or maybe,

00:30:30.585 --> 00:30:31.585
that the

00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:41.560
tankers might break and it will have oil, oil all over,

00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:43.320
if you spoil the beach.

00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:45.680
If you spoil the beach.

00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:48.840
you might invite the typhoons

00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:51.620
and you might have all the problems.

00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:54.360
Or on the sea beach if you develop

00:30:55.360 --> 00:31:00.400
things like tobacco and all those harmful things like alcohol,

00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:04.820
then the typhoon will come and break that.

00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:07.600
So, one should be very careful.

00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:09.860
If you are on the sea shore you have advantages,

00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:11.960
but the greatest disadvantage is that

00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:17.360
Guru is very powerful and extremely holy and auspicious,

00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:19.440
absolutely auspicious.

00:31:19.935 --> 00:31:21.795
So, one has to be careful on that.

00:31:22.395 --> 00:31:25.765
Those who have weakening [unsure] here or done these things are very wrong.

00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:28.900
They don’t understand what the sea means.

00:31:30.340 --> 00:31:31.340
May God bless you!

00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:32.080
Jai Shri Mataji.

00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:33.120
May God bless you.

00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:21.740
A real heart!

00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:27.720
Real heart, I tell you. Someone should take a photograph.

00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:30.580
A real heart!

00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:33.800
Get a photograph.

00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:37.340
Hold on the thing, shadow on the lands and you take it straight up.

00:37:37.340 --> 00:37:38.340
Exactly a heart.

00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:38.840
Tike?

00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:42.400
Swing it from the side.

00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:44.800
Swing it from here and take it up.

00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:32.620
Shortly before the Gauri puja.

00:38:50.060 --> 00:38:52.740
Then Shri Mataji goes to the temple

00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:55.600
and Shri Ganesha [inaudible].

00:39:02.780 --> 00:39:04.640
It's very good.

00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:08.180
Just wanted to get your hands.
