WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.780
The sea must be worshipped

00:24.500 --> 00:26.500
It's quite cold.

00:47.520 --> 00:48.820
Have you been there?

00:48.940 --> 00:50.400
Just going down to it Mother.

00:50.460 --> 00:51.820
All right, you go with him.

00:51.980 --> 00:54.200
This the 30th of December, 1985

00:54.200 --> 00:56.200
Come along

00:56.200 --> 00:58.200
What about my chappals?

00:58.200 --> 01:00.200
Are these my chappals?

01:00.200 --> 01:02.200
No.

01:09.040 --> 01:11.040
You had your bath?

01:11.040 --> 01:12.400
Sea bath, you got it?

01:12.400 --> 01:16.760
I was going to go but Rustom took me by force in the canteen.

01:24.780 --> 01:27.240
It's getting quite cold.

01:28.700 --> 01:30.760
Such a good sport, you know?

01:30.760 --> 01:31.760
Yes, Mother.

01:31.760 --> 01:33.920
I guess [inaudible]

01:37.380 --> 01:43.380
The dream, Shri Mataji, that we had last year of coming to Ganapatipule

01:43.380 --> 01:45.380


01:56.600 --> 01:57.600
[Hindi]

01:57.920 --> 01:58.940


02:02.300 --> 02:04.880
You’ve come without any reputation

02:07.120 --> 02:10.500
I got the balance with us [unsure].

04:07.820 --> 04:09.020


04:16.480 --> 04:17.480


04:21.960 --> 04:23.140
She's all right.

04:23.300 --> 04:24.900
She's all right and she has,

04:25.720 --> 04:27.700
she has accepted.

04:27.700 --> 04:29.700
I think he was a little shorter than what she thought.

04:29.900 --> 04:32.200
She has three children what is she accepting?

04:32.300 --> 04:33.800
Yes, yes, yes.

04:34.020 --> 04:37.200
I just don’t understand with three children, this, that nonsense.

04:37.340 --> 04:39.140
[Hindi]

04:39.200 --> 04:41.260
They should all go to UK.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.900
She’ll get some from Lucknow Shri Mataji.

04:43.900 --> 04:45.160
Lucknow.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.820


04:49.185 --> 04:52.215


04:53.120 --> 04:54.120


04:54.800 --> 04:58.220


04:58.460 --> 05:01.200


05:01.420 --> 05:04.620


05:04.860 --> 05:07.840


05:10.175 --> 05:11.685


05:12.740 --> 05:13.740


05:15.620 --> 05:17.200
It's such a nice woman.

05:17.700 --> 05:18.700
So, now,

05:18.700 --> 05:20.700
She said "no".

05:23.420 --> 05:26.240
And we haven't got any info from her since.

05:30.340 --> 05:33.260
John Noyce is here, what he is saying?

05:33.420 --> 05:35.740
He's here but we haven't got anyw word from him.

05:35.740 --> 05:37.740
No, no, why he is late?

05:38.840 --> 05:39.760
John Noyce is here?

05:39.760 --> 05:43.280
There are other [inaudible] if we can get him.

05:46.260 --> 05:47.840
John Noyce is an Australian?

05:47.840 --> 05:49.300


05:49.300 --> 05:50.720
This is the tall guy here.

05:50.720 --> 05:51.520
Yes.

05:51.520 --> 05:54.100
Shri Mataji, that's the first choice that You had for her.

05:54.160 --> 05:55.240
Who's that?

05:55.380 --> 05:56.380
John Noyce.

05:56.380 --> 05:58.380
Then what did she say?

05:58.600 --> 06:01.480
She said nothing, truly, I wonder why, why-

06:01.940 --> 06:03.460
It had gone off.

06:03.540 --> 06:04.560
I don't know.

06:04.560 --> 06:06.560
They thought, somebody told Me, she doesn't want.

06:06.740 --> 06:11.120
Shri Mataji, maybe that John Noyce wants her to go to Australia.

06:11.560 --> 06:12.560
He wants her to go to Australia.

06:12.900 --> 06:13.900
Who's that?

06:13.900 --> 06:15.900
John Noyce.

09:57.820 --> 10:00.060
You get good televisions in India. Thank you.

10:00.720 --> 10:03.040
I know but he’s critic about what we do.

10:03.520 --> 10:06.180
I had to bring him with me, because these people, you see,

10:06.500 --> 10:08.640
I don't know they put already made dust in it

10:08.760 --> 10:10.480
to make it [inaudible]

10:10.480 --> 10:12.340
Why try such a trick? I don’t understand.

10:14.140 --> 10:16.500
This fellow; there’s one fellow who's called Marlow.

10:16.660 --> 10:18.040
He’s so negative!

10:52.540 --> 10:57.540
The person who was there. He said, " ... I can get

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000


11:01.000 --> 11:03.000


11:07.560 --> 11:09.560
You can say it in English, Shri Mataji.

11:11.460 --> 11:13.760
?

11:13.760 --> 11:15.760
It is like a country.

11:17.960 --> 11:20.400
The custom officer ?

11:20.400 --> 11:22.400
She didn't get me a visa.

11:23.560 --> 11:27.440
That’s a fact, I mean, I have no time to think of such things.

11:27.440 --> 11:29.440
While this is English mind.

11:29.960 --> 11:31.960
Never go straight.

11:32.360 --> 11:35.680
I would say that they have a loose angle

11:37.500 --> 11:39.500


11:42.700 --> 11:44.700
I have to tell them.

11:44.820 --> 11:46.980
They cannot think straight.

11:46.980 --> 11:48.980
You got it?

11:49.120 --> 11:50.500
They cannot be sincere.

11:51.940 --> 11:55.260
They are not sincere people. They have no heart.

12:01.080 --> 12:04.620
But especially that fellow who has done it, he’s a very crooked fellow.

12:05.540 --> 12:08.520
And he had been taking drugs, this, that.

12:14.920 --> 12:15.760
...Study.

12:15.760 --> 12:17.760
Ah, very good!

12:18.300 --> 12:19.580
Can I read now?

12:19.720 --> 12:20.580
No, later

12:20.880 --> 12:22.400
I can read.

12:22.400 --> 12:23.320
Yes, yes.

12:23.680 --> 12:26.560
You have to Dedicate yourself completely to me,

12:26.565 --> 12:28.725
not to Sahaja Yoga, but to me.

12:29.155 --> 12:31.695
Sahaja Yoga is just one of my aspects.

12:32.025 --> 12:34.815
Leaving everything, you have to dedicate.

12:34.865 --> 12:36.525
Complete dedication,

12:36.525 --> 12:39.365
otherwise you cannot ascend any further.

12:39.365 --> 12:41.295
Without questioning, without arguing.

12:41.680 --> 12:46.040
Dedication is the easiest way to get rid of all your angularities,

12:46.620 --> 12:49.120
all your problems, all your badhas.

12:49.680 --> 12:53.440
Complete dedication, is the only way you can grow further.

12:54.020 --> 12:55.120
Krishna said,

12:55.380 --> 12:59.060
‘Sarva dharmanam parityajya, mamekam sharanam vraja’.

12:59.540 --> 13:01.460
Forget all the religion of the world (dharma).

13:01.860 --> 13:04.240
There is no difference between him and me

13:04.240 --> 13:06.220
but today I am the one,

13:06.720 --> 13:09.120
I am the one who has given you Realization.

13:09.880 --> 13:12.780
All these dharmas are to be given up entirely,

13:13.345 --> 13:16.165
and you have to surrender fully from your heart.

13:16.535 --> 13:19.135
Here, as you are before me today,

13:19.135 --> 13:21.335
I want to tell you very frankly,

13:21.745 --> 13:24.335
as Krishna had told only Arjuna,

13:24.335 --> 13:27.435
‘Sarva dharmanam parityajya, mamekam sharanam vraja’.

13:27.740 --> 13:29.300
Shri Krishna has said,

13:29.540 --> 13:32.800
"Give up all your dharmas and surrender them to me,

13:32.800 --> 13:34.100
surrender to my dharma only."

13:34.240 --> 13:36.860
"You should only know what you owe to me."

13:36.860 --> 13:38.600
meaning the Divinity.

13:38.600 --> 13:42.040
Now Shri Krishna is not there, it’s me who is Shri Krishna,

13:42.100 --> 13:44.740
so you must know what you owe to Me.

13:46.640 --> 13:48.800
She can be achieved through bhakti.

13:49.300 --> 13:51.960
She can only be achieved through dedication.

13:52.905 --> 13:55.855
She’s only fond of her bhaktas, the devotees.

13:56.435 --> 13:59.545
For this, meditation is the only way I should say.

13:59.805 --> 14:02.955
Emotionally you may feel closer to me in your heart.

14:03.280 --> 14:06.260
But through meditation, surrender.

14:06.720 --> 14:10.520
Meditation is nothing but surrendering, is complete surrendering.

14:11.200 --> 14:15.180
In your full freedom, complete freedom, you have to surrender.

14:16.740 --> 14:18.240
And only through your bhakti,

14:18.340 --> 14:20.080
through your devotion and dedication,

14:20.080 --> 14:21.560
you can achieve me.

14:21.980 --> 14:26.000
My achievement is the complete manifestation of your Divine powers.

14:29.180 --> 14:32.880
It’s very simple, made so simple.

14:33.940 --> 14:36.680
I’m only pleased by people who are simple,

14:36.800 --> 14:38.940
innocent, who are not tricky,

14:39.480 --> 14:42.160
who are loving, affectionate to each other.

14:42.540 --> 14:44.400
It’s very easy to please me.

14:44.920 --> 14:47.080
When I see you loving each other,

14:47.500 --> 14:51.540
talking good of each other, helping each other, respecting each other,

14:51.980 --> 14:55.960
laughing aloud together, enjoying together each other’s company,

14:56.680 --> 14:58.900
I get my blessing, my first joy.

15:00.480 --> 15:02.500
So, the dedication in meditation,

15:03.640 --> 15:06.780
complete dedication in meditation, must be practiced.

15:07.580 --> 15:11.780
It’s not for your good now you are doing it, so-called ‘your’.

15:12.060 --> 15:14.200
First you were a little baby, a small thing;

15:15.060 --> 15:17.680
now you are that collective being,

15:17.800 --> 15:21.500
you are not doing anything for yourself, but for that collective being.

15:22.400 --> 15:24.620
You are growing to be aware of that whole

15:24.900 --> 15:26.680
which you are going to become.

15:27.100 --> 15:30.000
Your jobs, your money, your wives,

15:30.300 --> 15:33.600
your husbands, your children, your father, mother, relations,

15:33.660 --> 15:36.280
these considerations are over now.

15:36.500 --> 15:40.660
You all have to take up the responsibility of Sahaja Yoga.

15:41.120 --> 15:43.660
Every one of you is quite capable.

15:44.900 --> 15:46.640
You are brought up for that.

15:47.000 --> 15:50.400
In dedication, in complete devotion, you have to do it

15:50.720 --> 15:54.315
now, not for your own gain, for your own achievement,

15:54.320 --> 15:55.980
that is over now.

15:56.340 --> 15:58.860
It’s for completely getting out of the mire

15:58.980 --> 16:04.600
and standing on the land, singing aloud the praise of your Father.

16:04.600 --> 16:06.740
You have to bear the brunt,

16:06.820 --> 16:08.560
and the sacrifice,

16:09.020 --> 16:11.060
which are no more sacrifices to you

16:11.060 --> 16:13.720
because Spirit gives, it never sacrifices.

16:14.820 --> 16:19.740
Its quality is to give. So, you don’t sacrifice, you just give.

16:20.540 --> 16:22.680
Today, one more lecture Mother?

16:22.680 --> 16:24.680
Yes, yes. It's coming out well.

16:26.720 --> 16:28.200
Our greatest possession.

16:28.600 --> 16:31.540
The greatest possession you have is your Mother.

16:32.615 --> 16:35.485
Through her you have your brothers and sisters.

16:36.235 --> 16:38.945
Now the name of your Mother is very powerful.

16:39.460 --> 16:43.460
You know that is the most powerful name than all other names,

16:44.060 --> 16:47.460
the most powerful name. But you must know how to take it.

16:49.880 --> 16:53.000
With that complete dedication you have to take that name.

16:53.220 --> 16:57.460
I have taken birth in this world in the binding of Sahaja Yogis

16:58.040 --> 17:01.440
and have been moving around only in their binding.

17:02.220 --> 17:04.240
I am desireless

17:04.240 --> 17:07.540
and hence my everything depends upon your desires.

17:07.780 --> 17:11.520
Attain Me; I am yours! I am for you.

17:12.340 --> 17:17.240
I have given you that which has been beyond the reach of very great sages and saints.

17:17.880 --> 17:22.760
When I’m speaking it is a mantra, when I’m not speaking, is a mantra flowing.

17:23.860 --> 17:28.100
Those who are fanatically adhering to me are also not correct.

17:28.780 --> 17:31.140
There should be no fanaticism about it.

17:31.140 --> 17:33.260
But the ideal one important thing.

17:35.320 --> 17:37.100


17:37.560 --> 17:38.560


17:38.700 --> 17:41.320
He’s a real income tax man!

17:44.540 --> 17:45.980


17:48.400 --> 17:51.580
Come to tax my income you see!

17:54.860 --> 17:58.720
I have read it in order to show who is the true ideal.

18:00.060 --> 18:04.980
That a Sahaja Yogi is happy in the circumstances that are prevailing.

18:05.200 --> 18:10.920
If he is not, then his satisfaction is superficial and not from within.

18:11.500 --> 18:14.700
A river starts with a very small little drop,

18:15.240 --> 18:19.120
and then it expands, expands, expands, expands.

18:22.280 --> 18:29.120
When you become the parents and then you enjoy other children as much as you enjoy your child,

18:29.620 --> 18:31.780
then your generosity has started.

18:32.780 --> 18:36.820
You have to be a peaceful person, not an aggressive person.

18:37.300 --> 18:39.820
The person who is peaceful is powerful

18:40.260 --> 18:44.440
the one who doesn’t react to anything else, is the most powerful.

18:45.160 --> 18:47.700
You have to be kind to others.

18:48.760 --> 18:50.520
You have to be neat and clean.

18:50.820 --> 18:55.660
First is forgiveness, second the detachment leading to compassion.

18:56.280 --> 18:59.860
These are the wheels of your chariot which moves you.

19:01.080 --> 19:04.920
You have been made like temples. Keep it clean.

19:05.480 --> 19:09.180
We are moving towards the soothing qualities of the Spirit.

19:09.860 --> 19:13.800
You have to ‘soothe’ the others and not to excite, but to soothe.

19:14.600 --> 19:18.100
Let God’s melodies be sounded from your flutes.

19:18.820 --> 19:22.540
You must have the capacity to deepen your meditative power,

19:22.860 --> 19:26.360
so that these ideals go and settle in your heart,

19:26.360 --> 19:29.040
as a part and parcel of your being.

19:29.600 --> 19:34.480
Once the saints know this is the principle on which we have to live,

19:34.480 --> 19:36.580
they become one with the principles.

19:37.520 --> 19:38.700


19:39.580 --> 19:43.780
these are principles on which we have to live are there.

19:44.180 --> 19:46.460
You become the mother,

19:46.460 --> 19:50.800
and you, whatever you are which has to grow, is the child.

19:52.480 --> 19:55.980
If you are a Sahaja Yogi you have to be a flower,

19:56.120 --> 19:59.860
and a strong flower, and an eternal flower

19:59.860 --> 20:03.280
that always grows, does not fade out,

20:03.280 --> 20:05.760
always growing, never fades,

20:05.760 --> 20:07.560
such a flower you have to be.

20:08.460 --> 20:11.640
Sahaja Yogis should never be angry.

20:12.760 --> 20:15.480


20:16.360 --> 20:18.260
If somebody has to tell you

20:18.780 --> 20:20.700
that you must organize go fast

20:21.380 --> 20:24.180
and hold back and do not feel bad.

20:24.180 --> 20:26.555
We have to do so much work in this world.

20:26.560 --> 20:28.600
We have no time to waste.

20:29.060 --> 20:32.080
Truly keep the maryadas in Sahaja Yoga

20:32.080 --> 20:37.220
same morning and evening that, "I am a Sahaja Yogi", nobody can harm you,

20:38.340 --> 20:41.020
hurt you, nobody can trouble you.

20:41.435 --> 20:43.140
On the contrary,

20:43.140 --> 20:44.845
you will be enjoying life

20:44.925 --> 20:46.695
if you keep to the maryadas.

20:47.785 --> 20:49.815
One must promise to God that,

20:50.280 --> 20:52.560
"We’ll know about Sahaja Yoga

20:52.980 --> 20:54.680
through proper understanding

20:55.180 --> 20:56.840
reading every word of it.

20:57.525 --> 20:59.965
We’ll master the knowledge of Sahaja Yoga.

21:00.495 --> 21:02.385
We will keep ourselves clean

21:02.780 --> 21:06.640
and completely surrender ourselves, our lives to Sahaja Yoga."

21:07.300 --> 21:11.240
Surrendering to Sahaja Yoga is actually surrendering to joy,

21:11.760 --> 21:13.320
bliss and peace.

21:14.735 --> 21:16.605
Language should be sweet.

21:16.965 --> 21:18.815
Your behaviour should be good.

21:19.295 --> 21:21.145
You should be very gentle and soft;

21:21.700 --> 21:25.200
you should move like a Yogi, live like a saint.

21:25.780 --> 21:28.220
And people should see through you

21:28.220 --> 21:30.060
the greatness of Sahaja Yoga.

21:30.900 --> 21:32.480
See the trees

21:32.580 --> 21:36.420
when they get their flowers, they are not so respectful.

21:36.960 --> 21:39.980
But when they are laden by the fruits

21:39.980 --> 21:41.860
they bow down to Mother Earth.

21:41.860 --> 21:43.460
In the same way

21:43.680 --> 21:46.000
when you have got the fruits of Sahaja Yoga,

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
you all must bow down.

21:48.600 --> 21:50.600
You have to be sensitive to God

21:50.780 --> 21:52.960
and not to bad things.

21:53.240 --> 21:56.340
You have to change your methods.

21:56.340 --> 21:58.740
The person who cannot change his methods

21:58.740 --> 22:00.540
cannot spread Sahaja Yoga.

22:00.840 --> 22:03.740
Because he sticks to only to one way.

22:03.880 --> 22:05.740
with which people get bored.

22:06.045 --> 22:07.595
You should find new ways.

22:08.480 --> 22:10.720
An established Sahaja Yogi is the one

22:11.180 --> 22:13.840
who becomes completely one with God

22:13.960 --> 22:15.800
and wins him over.

22:16.260 --> 22:17.940
He has to do everything for that.

22:17.940 --> 22:20.140
This is how is a true Sahaja Yogi.

22:20.300 --> 22:21.300


22:21.445 --> 22:22.445


22:23.215 --> 22:24.325


22:26.280 --> 22:27.540


22:31.020 --> 22:33.100
How to keep Mother pleased.

22:33.480 --> 22:37.000
That’s me, so that I know!

22:39.100 --> 22:41.680
So, how to please Mother?

22:42.420 --> 22:44.640
I am also a simple person

22:45.100 --> 22:48.500
so I want a simple-hearted person.

22:49.900 --> 22:52.180


22:53.720 --> 22:57.000
So, this Heart Chakra is to be first looked after.

22:57.720 --> 23:01.520
That with your heart - desire, you will keep your Mother pleased.

23:05.800 --> 23:08.335
First of all, your heart must be clear.

23:08.335 --> 23:10.145
If the heart is not clear,

23:10.145 --> 23:13.880
then everything has no meaning because it is a “dark heart”

23:14.580 --> 23:17.400
which is doing all these things.

23:17.500 --> 23:20.260
The heart has to be clean, absolutely surrendered

23:20.720 --> 23:23.820
and must try to put me before everything else.

23:24.520 --> 23:28.360
The Lakshmi tattva has to become Mahalakshmi tattva.

23:29.100 --> 23:31.140
That is for your ascent.

23:32.000 --> 23:36.100
And just to get into the Mahalakshmi tattva

23:36.940 --> 23:40.460
what you have to do is to use all your material things

23:41.180 --> 23:43.740
and your material being in such a way

23:43.880 --> 23:45.640
that you please me.

23:46.280 --> 23:48.720
Bapre, give me horrible things, all right.

23:48.720 --> 23:50.700
You have to keep your Mother pleased

23:50.800 --> 23:53.300
You have to keep your Mother pleased by pleasing other Sahaja Yogis

23:54.020 --> 23:55.620
and not other people.

23:57.100 --> 24:01.440
What guru dakshinat have you given me?

24:01.920 --> 24:06.960
Understand that your money is not worth the dust

24:06.960 --> 24:10.140
on the feet of your Mother Guru.

24:11.340 --> 24:13.160
You should give your hearts,

24:13.580 --> 24:16.200
only clean and holy hearts.

24:17.380 --> 24:19.520
You must clean your physical beings.

24:20.480 --> 24:23.420
You must get up early in the morning

24:23.420 --> 24:26.640
and spend at least one hour on meditation and worshipping.

24:26.985 --> 24:30.015
Perform "Aarti" and meditation in the evening.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
I'll read about laws of the Divine.

24:36.960 --> 24:38.980
One must know

24:39.580 --> 24:41.220
these laws of the Divine,

24:42.000 --> 24:44.880
that you have to live with self-respect

24:45.215 --> 24:46.865
that we have to be chaste.

24:47.725 --> 24:49.585
that we have to have dignity,

24:50.155 --> 24:53.375
that we cannot steal money and steal things

24:54.060 --> 24:56.300
and be parasites.

24:57.200 --> 24:59.020
That we cannot kill others

24:59.660 --> 25:01.200
and we cannot beat others

25:01.680 --> 25:03.220
and say harsh things,

25:03.820 --> 25:05.360
they are just the same.

25:06.220 --> 25:09.340
And that we have respect,

25:09.340 --> 25:12.340
the respect for all that is sublime.

25:13.240 --> 25:15.160
Respect for all the saints

25:16.000 --> 25:17.920
that are Sahaja Yogis.

25:17.920 --> 25:21.340
And the respect for the leaders who represent you Mother.

25:21.980 --> 25:25.000
With all this, we are very different people.

25:25.380 --> 25:26.660
We are different race.

25:26.960 --> 25:28.600
We are virtuous,

25:28.840 --> 25:29.960
we are righteous

25:30.280 --> 25:32.280
and we are proud to be that way.

25:32.680 --> 25:34.400
We are sure of everything.

25:34.440 --> 25:36.440
We know about every thing.

25:36.840 --> 25:38.840
And we are personification of Compassion,

25:39.100 --> 25:40.600
of Love of God.

25:40.600 --> 25:42.460
That’s what we are.

25:42.460 --> 25:44.680
We are not ordinary people.

25:45.140 --> 25:48.080
On the subtler side is compassion is forgiveness

25:48.300 --> 25:49.580
is love.

25:50.405 --> 25:53.385
But the greatest of all is service to God.

25:53.615 --> 25:55.405
We are doing the work of God.

25:55.825 --> 25:57.325
How can we be tired?

25:58.005 --> 26:00.345
The dynamic is flowing through us,

26:00.660 --> 26:03.180
that compassion is so fulfilling,

26:03.820 --> 26:06.600
that love is so beautifying

26:06.765 --> 26:09.325
that how can we not do it?

26:09.485 --> 26:11.925
God has created this universe,

26:11.925 --> 26:14.175
this world and you people

26:14.540 --> 26:17.800
out of this compassion only, just his compassion.

26:19.400 --> 26:20.960
Beautiful!

26:22.860 --> 26:24.640
I think it’s come out well Mother.

26:24.640 --> 26:25.920
Very well!

26:26.220 --> 26:29.640
It just shows how subtly you are an income tax fellow!

26:31.980 --> 26:33.820
Really, you’ve done very well, very well.

26:33.920 --> 26:36.175
But actually, what I feel, that when,

26:36.180 --> 26:37.940
out of context people read it, you see,

26:39.060 --> 26:41.360
it might look little bit too much.

26:41.360 --> 26:43.620
But I will read it only to Sahaja Yogis.

26:43.620 --> 26:45.380
Yes, then it’s all right.

26:45.500 --> 26:46.820
Sahaja Yogis, they’ll be happy to hear that.

26:47.100 --> 26:50.380
Very happy, in one place the essence is there, on many topics.

26:50.380 --> 26:52.115
But for others, you see,

26:52.115 --> 26:55.265
they might get a shock, because when I speak,

26:55.265 --> 26:58.260
I always cover it with some chocolates, you see.

26:58.500 --> 27:00.720
So, the Castrol is going in straight forward.

27:01.580 --> 27:03.760
But Sahaja Yogis, they love to have Castrol

27:04.460 --> 27:05.440
direct.

27:05.640 --> 27:08.800
It’s all right, as long as it doesn’t go into the hands of others

27:08.800 --> 27:10.540
it’s perfectly all right.

27:10.540 --> 27:14.020


27:15.780 --> 27:19.120
"With Shri Mataji on the beach"

28:42.700 --> 28:45.035


28:45.035 --> 28:47.315


28:47.315 --> 28:49.045


28:49.045 --> 28:51.195


28:51.925 --> 28:55.345


28:55.345 --> 28:56.340


29:01.740 --> 29:05.040
Shri Mataji, please, tell us something for our record.

29:05.040 --> 29:05.820
Hum?

29:05.820 --> 29:08.440
Please, tell us something for our record, here.

29:08.640 --> 29:09.340
For what?

29:09.580 --> 29:10.720
For our record.

29:11.120 --> 29:13.960
So, you’ve come on the beach for the first time during this trip.

29:13.960 --> 29:14.600
Yes.

29:16.380 --> 29:19.280
You see the sea is the Father,

29:20.220 --> 29:21.540
is the Guru

29:22.780 --> 29:24.460
and he must be worshipped

29:27.340 --> 29:30.080
before you do any puja, Guru must to be worshipped.

29:31.780 --> 29:35.880
First the Shri Ganesha and then the Guru has to be worshipped.

29:36.920 --> 29:39.840
That’s why I came to the sea,

29:39.960 --> 29:41.760
so you all learnt

29:41.760 --> 29:43.800
that you all have to worship the sea

29:43.860 --> 29:46.060
and not to spoil things like this.

29:46.280 --> 29:47.260
See now:

29:47.260 --> 29:49.260
That’s not a good idea.

29:49.340 --> 29:51.180
You should never spoil a sea shore.

29:51.740 --> 29:54.660
That’s your Father’s altar, it should not be spoiled.

29:55.100 --> 29:56.100
And

29:56.635 --> 29:57.635
also,

29:58.700 --> 30:00.540
to wear funny dresses

30:00.940 --> 30:05.560
and misbehave in the presence of your Guru is inauspicious.

30:05.800 --> 30:07.400
One should not do like that.

30:08.000 --> 30:12.420
But I don’t know how many understand the importance of the sea.

30:13.880 --> 30:16.360
If you behave like this, the sea goes angry

30:16.360 --> 30:17.960
then you have lots of problems.

30:18.855 --> 30:19.855
Like,

30:20.695 --> 30:23.775
it may never be a sunny day for you to come to the sea.

30:23.965 --> 30:24.965
Or maybe,

30:25.315 --> 30:28.215
on every holiday it will be a clouded day.

30:29.005 --> 30:30.045
Or maybe,

30:30.585 --> 30:31.585
that the

30:37.260 --> 30:41.560
tankers might break and it will have oil, oil all over,

30:41.680 --> 30:43.320
if you spoil the beach.

30:44.280 --> 30:45.680
If you spoil the beach.

30:45.680 --> 30:48.840
you might invite the typhoons

30:49.260 --> 30:51.620
and you might have all the problems.

30:51.960 --> 30:54.360
Or on the sea beach if you develop

30:55.360 --> 31:00.400
things like tobacco and all those harmful things like alcohol,

31:00.980 --> 31:04.820
then the typhoon will come and break that.

31:05.700 --> 31:07.600
So, one should be very careful.

31:07.600 --> 31:09.860
If you are on the sea shore you have advantages,

31:09.860 --> 31:11.960
but the greatest disadvantage is that

31:12.360 --> 31:17.360
Guru is very powerful and extremely holy and auspicious,

31:17.800 --> 31:19.440
absolutely auspicious.

31:19.935 --> 31:21.795
So, one has to be careful on that.

31:22.395 --> 31:25.765
Those who have weakening [unsure] here or done these things are very wrong.

31:26.360 --> 31:28.900
They don’t understand what the sea means.

31:30.340 --> 31:31.340
May God bless you!

31:31.340 --> 31:32.080
Jai Shri Mataji.

31:32.080 --> 31:33.120
May God bless you.

33:43.300 --> 33:44.300


33:44.975 --> 33:45.975


33:57.205 --> 33:58.505


33:59.955 --> 34:00.955


34:01.015 --> 34:02.015


34:04.215 --> 34:05.715


34:14.835 --> 34:15.835


34:16.665 --> 34:17.665


35:01.180 --> 35:02.180


35:29.680 --> 35:31.020


35:31.960 --> 35:32.960


35:36.215 --> 35:37.215


35:37.735 --> 35:38.735


36:02.725 --> 36:03.725


37:00.705 --> 37:01.705


37:12.765 --> 37:13.765


37:17.320 --> 37:18.920


37:19.680 --> 37:21.740
A real heart!

37:24.260 --> 37:27.720
Real heart, I tell you. Someone should take a photograph.

37:27.720 --> 37:28.980


37:29.580 --> 37:30.580
A real heart!

37:32.280 --> 37:33.800
Get a photograph.

37:33.800 --> 37:37.340
Hold on the thing, shadow on the lands and you take it straight up.

37:37.340 --> 37:38.340
Exactly a heart.

37:38.340 --> 37:38.840
Tike?

37:40.680 --> 37:42.400
Swing it from the side.

37:42.780 --> 37:44.800
Swing it from here and take it up.

37:44.960 --> 37:47.020


38:08.045 --> 38:09.045


38:23.580 --> 38:24.620


38:29.080 --> 38:32.620
Shortly before the Gauri puja.

38:34.620 --> 38:36.620


38:50.060 --> 38:52.740
Then Shri Mataji goes to the temple

38:53.400 --> 38:55.600
and Shri Ganesha [inaudible].

39:02.780 --> 39:04.640
It's very good.

39:05.520 --> 39:08.180
Just wanted to get your hands.

41:15.940 --> 41:16.940


41:20.145 --> 41:21.235


41:23.525 --> 41:24.875


41:26.965 --> 41:28.425


41:29.505 --> 41:30.505


41:31.975 --> 41:33.905


41:58.255 --> 41:59.255


42:00.075 --> 42:02.845


42:26.955 --> 42:28.625


42:29.035 --> 42:31.635


42:38.155 --> 42:39.975


42:40.875 --> 42:41.875


42:50.905 --> 42:51.905


43:39.075 --> 43:40.055


43:40.055 --> 43:41.055


43:43.855 --> 43:44.855


43:45.835 --> 43:47.235


43:47.935 --> 43:48.945


43:49.675 --> 43:51.245


43:52.645 --> 43:54.865


43:56.115 --> 43:57.115


43:59.445 --> 44:00.445


44:00.695 --> 44:02.815


44:03.285 --> 44:05.125


44:05.645 --> 44:07.425


44:08.215 --> 44:11.395


44:11.675 --> 44:14.695


44:14.695 --> 44:15.695


44:16.135 --> 44:18.905


44:19.725 --> 44:22.925


44:22.925 --> 44:23.865


44:23.865 --> 44:25.695
