00:00:24.148 --> 00:00:28.194
Today I just thought that there are

00:00:28.523 --> 00:00:31.069
quite a lot of people who have come for the first time.

00:00:31.711 --> 00:00:33.741
And I should tell them about

00:00:34.555 --> 00:00:38.101
the significance of Puja.

00:00:38.531 --> 00:00:43.958
Because, as the western style of life is,

00:00:44.864 --> 00:00:49.289
that they're meant to be like this.

00:00:49.801 --> 00:00:54.658
To seek something outside, to go outside,

00:00:54.858 --> 00:00:58.720
find out new ways and methods to grow outside.

00:00:59.552 --> 00:01:03.454
Now this is the knowledge of your roots.

00:01:03.685 --> 00:01:08.003
Knowledge, through which you receive your nourishment,

00:01:08.372 --> 00:01:12.855
this knowledge is not known to you before

00:01:13.286 --> 00:01:15.887
and was not deliberately told

00:01:16.088 --> 00:01:19.297
because you are supposed to grow outside.

00:01:19.542 --> 00:01:24.466
Now when you have to go inside, then you have to understand

00:01:24.667 --> 00:01:29.417
the divine laws and divine methods, how it works out.

00:01:30.427 --> 00:01:33.380
The Puja has a significance,

00:01:33.669 --> 00:01:37.627
from ancient times the saints described them.

00:01:37.827 --> 00:01:40.760
Because in India, the whole climate is such

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.249
that you can live under a tree,

00:01:44.774 --> 00:01:47.594
live in a forest no problem,

00:01:47.795 --> 00:01:51.357
you can eat fruits and very happily you could be in a forest.

00:01:51.591 --> 00:01:55.408
There is no need to have bed or anything, it is so warm and nice,

00:01:55.623 --> 00:01:59.658
and then always enjoy the bliss of a forest.

00:02:00.674 --> 00:02:04.066
And thus many people went into the forest

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:08.478
and started thinking, looking at the whole world from that

00:02:10.017 --> 00:02:11.751
solitude,

00:02:12.149 --> 00:02:13.637
what is the problem with human being?

00:02:13.845 --> 00:02:15.235
Why are we here?

00:02:15.454 --> 00:02:17.151
What should we do?

00:02:17.352 --> 00:02:20.029
What is the purpose of this human life?

00:02:20.372 --> 00:02:22.899
Why God has given us this beautiful human life?

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:25.223
They started thinking about it.

00:02:25.466 --> 00:02:28.335
And that is how they went into meditative position,

00:02:28.536 --> 00:02:32.318
meditative entry within themselves.

00:02:32.551 --> 00:02:36.279
And when they started meditating, they found all about Kundalini,

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.543
about chakras and the deities that reside on them.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.144
Now, these deities have resided from eternal times.

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:50.165
We can say in the abode of God they have all resided there

00:02:50.386 --> 00:02:54.894
and then they were reflected on this Earth

00:02:55.389 --> 00:03:00.120
and they incarnated just to give us

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.139
a better and better awareness.

00:03:03.537 --> 00:03:06.001
We could have avoided all this.

00:03:06.285 --> 00:03:09.079
It could have been very easy

00:03:09.314 --> 00:03:13.943
if we had listened to God at the time of Adam and Eve.

00:03:14.294 --> 00:03:17.047
At the time of Adam and Eve,

00:03:17.407 --> 00:03:22.152
it was told that you should not eat the fruit of knowledge.

00:03:22.407 --> 00:03:25.352
Now, that was not the fruit of the true knowledge,

00:03:25.586 --> 00:03:29.198
but the fruit of knowledge was the knowledge about the matter,

00:03:29.399 --> 00:03:31.617
the knowledge about things.

00:03:31.843 --> 00:03:36.966
So, as you know, the story is, satanic forces worked,

00:03:37.218 --> 00:03:40.771
they lured both of them and they started

00:03:41.427 --> 00:03:44.958
developing themselves on the other side.

00:03:45.443 --> 00:03:47.177
That is how they made a mistake.

00:03:47.497 --> 00:03:50.200
That is why it is called as original sin.

00:03:50.485 --> 00:03:53.989
And that original sin has brought us to this brink now,

00:03:54.261 --> 00:03:55.902
and we have to go back.

00:03:56.102 --> 00:03:59.273
We have to go back within ourselves to find our roots.

00:03:59.473 --> 00:04:01.490
And that is why to improve

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:04.782
on their mistakes and to improve on their ignorance

00:04:04.982 --> 00:04:08.559
that is how the first ignorance was set in.

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:13.261
The darkness of ignorance was set in because of that mistake.

00:04:13.461 --> 00:04:16.934
And then from darkness we had to come to human stage.

00:04:17.233 --> 00:04:19.680
And when we have to come to human stage, we have to pass

00:04:19.881 --> 00:04:25.037
through all those different various stages of life where

00:04:26.974 --> 00:04:29.349
incarnations had to take place.

00:04:29.567 --> 00:04:31.702
So, now, as as you know very well,

00:04:32.145 --> 00:04:36.279
that we have incarnations placed within our centres

00:04:36.585 --> 00:04:39.452
which are not yet awakened.

00:04:40.014 --> 00:04:43.159
That means they are not in our attention.

00:04:43.359 --> 00:04:46.901
They are not to be felt in our central nervous system.

00:04:47.135 --> 00:04:51.191
Or we cannot feel them on our finger tips, to be very very simple.

00:04:51.391 --> 00:04:55.893
So they are there, but they are not acting according to our desire.

00:04:56.093 --> 00:04:59.315
We do not know them and they do not listen to us.

00:04:59.515 --> 00:05:03.518
They do what is right for them or what they think is proper.

00:05:03.718 --> 00:05:06.882
You have no connection with them so far.

00:05:07.281 --> 00:05:11.281
So, the first thing is to connect yourself

00:05:11.482 --> 00:05:14.798
with those different stages through which you have passed.

00:05:14.999 --> 00:05:17.398
So, the first as you know is the Ganesha's stage,

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.313
it is innocence. Innocence, the

00:05:20.514 --> 00:05:24.440
formless of innocence was made into Shri Ganesha,

00:05:24.932 --> 00:05:30.432
because some nucleus has to emit that innocence.

00:05:31.666 --> 00:05:34.517
Now, in the whole world

00:05:34.955 --> 00:05:38.849
there are eight such creations of the Mother Earth,

00:05:39.061 --> 00:05:42.695
and luckily they are in Maharastra.

00:05:43.031 --> 00:05:46.030
You will find Maharastrian people on the whole are innocent,

00:05:46.241 --> 00:05:49.486
compared to others, they are rather innocent by nature.

00:05:49.711 --> 00:05:54.159
And the reason is from the Mother Earth only the innocence is emitted.

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:57.622
So the first thing is that within us to establish innocence

00:05:57.822 --> 00:05:59.848
we have to worship Shri Ganesha.

00:06:00.049 --> 00:06:02.250
So, when you worship Me as Shri Ganesha,

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:05.244
the Shri Ganesha within you is awakened.

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:07.924
You see the result of that.

00:06:08.179 --> 00:06:09.821
So, the people who are suffering,

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:14.859
say, from the trouble of all these perversions,

00:06:15.059 --> 00:06:17.665
these modern diseases that have come,

00:06:17.907 --> 00:06:19.766
must establish their Shri Ganesha.

00:06:19.966 --> 00:06:23.592
If they cannot establish their Shri Ganesha, they cannot be cured.

00:06:23.865 --> 00:06:26.627
So their innocence has to be first established.

00:06:26.989 --> 00:06:29.249
If he cannot establish their innocence,

00:06:29.449 --> 00:06:31.208
we cannot cure them.

00:06:31.408 --> 00:06:34.823
First and foremost thing is to establish Shri Ganesha.

00:06:35.066 --> 00:06:38.751
And Shri Ganesha is made out of the Mother Earth element.

00:06:38.951 --> 00:06:42.589
So, by praying to Shri Ganesha we also establish Him,

00:06:42.789 --> 00:06:46.708
in a city, in a place like this place now

00:06:46.908 --> 00:06:51.008
is San Francisco, where I came here first we had no Puja, nothing.

00:06:51.208 --> 00:06:54.015
That is why the whole thing was just touch and go.

00:06:54.254 --> 00:06:55.784
I couldn't go deep into people.

00:06:55.985 --> 00:06:58.277
I couldn't go deep into the place and so the,

00:06:58.477 --> 00:07:00.549
I didn't know how I would be able to manage,

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:04.960
because there is no education on this.

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.288
People are not educated about it.

00:07:07.489 --> 00:07:09.884
But in India immediately the first thing is Puja.

00:07:10.084 --> 00:07:11.276
They will not come to my lecture,

00:07:11.476 --> 00:07:13.135
they will not come to anything, first is Puja.

00:07:13.335 --> 00:07:16.154
If there is a Puja, everybody is getting up at 4 o'clock,

00:07:16.421 --> 00:07:18.908
having a bath, getting ready to come to Puja.

00:07:19.108 --> 00:07:21.121
Because they know the importance of it,

00:07:21.321 --> 00:07:26.672
that just your essence is awakened by it.

00:07:26.946 --> 00:07:30.516
Essence is awakened and to awaken the essence

00:07:30.717 --> 00:07:33.860
you have to be

00:07:34.115 --> 00:07:36.295
there, at a place where this is done,

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:39.516
so that your essence is awakened.

00:07:39.717 --> 00:07:42.641
Now, the trouble is with ego-oriented societies,

00:07:42.842 --> 00:07:44.638
is very difficult to tell them about Puja.

00:07:44.881 --> 00:07:47.156
Itâ€™s find it difficult, that is why we do not allow

00:07:47.357 --> 00:07:49.377
everyone to come to Puja for one reason,

00:07:49.577 --> 00:07:52.149
because as soon as they see something happening,

00:07:52.174 --> 00:07:53.846
their ego starts up, you see.

00:07:53.871 --> 00:07:56.017
And instead of doing anything to them,

00:07:56.217 --> 00:08:01.377
the barrier is so much, that I can't just do anything about it.

00:08:01.402 --> 00:08:04.603
The barrier is too much in their ego, they have their own ideas,

00:08:04.803 --> 00:08:07.064
their own conceptions, their own feeling,

00:08:07.264 --> 00:08:12.506
and it's impossible to penetrate deep into them, so it is a waste.

00:08:12.758 --> 00:08:14.884
And if you cannot receive the vibrations,

00:08:15.084 --> 00:08:17.863
I feel the pain in my own centres.

00:08:18.082 --> 00:08:20.387
Because the deities, you see, get so annoyed,

00:08:20.611 --> 00:08:22.499
and they don't like it and they think that

00:08:22.699 --> 00:08:25.331
why Mother should waste Her energy with these people

00:08:25.531 --> 00:08:26.986
who do not understand about Puja.

00:08:27.187 --> 00:08:30.851
So, I want to prepare you beforehand, that you keep yourself open.

00:08:31.085 --> 00:08:32.929
Don't allow your ego to come up.

00:08:32.954 --> 00:08:35.662
It's nothing for Me to gain. It is for you to gain.

00:08:35.862 --> 00:08:37.413
Keep your minds open.

00:08:37.613 --> 00:08:40.027
The trouble is that at the time of this Sahasrara opening,

00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:43.179
this brain, everybody's brain is upside down.

00:08:43.379 --> 00:08:46.396
It is impossible, you try to turn it and they jump on you.

00:08:46.596 --> 00:08:48.890
It is a big problem for me, it is the biggest problem.

00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:50.851
Because, all other incarnations came,

00:08:51.051 --> 00:08:54.648
they didn't have to do this difficult work of making you something.

00:08:54.848 --> 00:08:58.451
Just it was to awaken within you a awareness,

00:08:58.652 --> 00:09:01.299
like Christ had to awaken your Agyna Charka.

00:09:01.519 --> 00:09:05.044
Alright, he has crucified himself for the same reason,

00:09:05.245 --> 00:09:07.635
He resurrected Himself for the same reason.

00:09:07.835 --> 00:09:09.884
It was a very hard life for him

00:09:10.084 --> 00:09:13.184
and, for the Mother, it was even worse, no doubt.

00:09:13.384 --> 00:09:18.837
But still, one should know that this is a very hazardous thing,

00:09:19.079 --> 00:09:22.544
to transform people and then to establish them

00:09:22.744 --> 00:09:28.696
and create out of these little seeds a huge big tree of a saint.

00:09:29.349 --> 00:09:32.932
Now, in the same way, we have got Moses, we have got Abraham,

00:09:33.132 --> 00:09:36.514
all these great saints are within our, in our void.

00:09:36.715 --> 00:09:39.365
They are the gurus. And on a Guru Puja,

00:09:39.566 --> 00:09:41.589
when you worship me on the Guru Puja day,

00:09:41.789 --> 00:09:45.106
that time these are awakened within you, and you become a master,

00:09:45.306 --> 00:09:46.550
you become yourself a Guru.

00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:49.499
You yourself know so much,

00:09:49.699 --> 00:09:51.976
even I don't have to tell you, I don't think

00:09:52.176 --> 00:09:56.537
I have talked to people very much in private, or explain to things.

00:09:56.737 --> 00:09:59.357
But somehow they become so much full of knowledge,

00:09:59.557 --> 00:10:02.132
that is rather surprising how they understand. Like,

00:10:02.332 --> 00:10:03.798
I was talking to Yogi Mahajan

00:10:03.998 --> 00:10:07.227
and he was telling me what's the problem is with human being and,

00:10:07.428 --> 00:10:10.866
you see, he was telling me how we cannot relate to them and all.

00:10:10.933 --> 00:10:13.787
Which is interesting, because My father did same to Me.

00:10:13.988 --> 00:10:18.051
I said that he is my first guru and all of you my second gurus.

00:10:18.659 --> 00:10:21.018
Because I don't understand human beings.

00:10:21.219 --> 00:10:23.224
You see for example, this homosexual business.

00:10:23.424 --> 00:10:25.944
When Gregoire, with very great reluctance, you see,

00:10:26.144 --> 00:10:27.401
told me through somebody else,

00:10:27.702 --> 00:10:30.452
I  nearly fainted, actually could not understand,

00:10:30.477 --> 00:10:32.901
what's happened to them? Now, what am I to do?

00:10:33.101 --> 00:10:35.654
And I couldn't eat my food for one week.

00:10:35.854 --> 00:10:37.851
I felt so bad about the whole thing.

00:10:37.876 --> 00:10:40.613
Like, My own children where are they?.

00:10:40.638 --> 00:10:44.722
If you have a heart of an intense Mother,

00:10:44.957 --> 00:10:46.795
you can understand what she feels about it.

00:10:46.996 --> 00:10:48.363
And I knew they are in for trouble,

00:10:48.564 --> 00:10:52.587
I knew everything was going to be very very hazardous.

00:10:52.831 --> 00:10:54.778
But doesn't matter, by God's grace

00:10:54.979 --> 00:10:57.063
everything will be all right. I am sure it will work out.

00:10:57.264 --> 00:10:59.549
So, first we have to establish Shri Ganesha.

00:10:59.757 --> 00:11:02.244
First of all, we have to establish Shri Ganesha within ourselves

00:11:02.445 --> 00:11:06.240
and Shri Ganesha in this place called San Francisco.

00:11:06.483 --> 00:11:09.732
Alright? That is why we have to first do Shri Ganesha's Puja.

00:11:09.974 --> 00:11:11.468
Then, secondly I told him

00:11:11.669 --> 00:11:15.015
that if possible we should do little bit of Shri Vishnu's,

00:11:15.216 --> 00:11:19.072
because he is the one who gives us the evolutionary power

00:11:19.273 --> 00:11:23.180
by which we can evolve ourselves and evolve others.

00:11:23.381 --> 00:11:26.708
So we have a little time for Shri Vishnu's Puja.

00:11:26.908 --> 00:11:29.521
Also, they do Havanas all that for Shri Vishnu's Puja,

00:11:29.846 --> 00:11:32.800
which is very good to clear the atmosphere sort of thing.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.736
But we will do next year all these things, perhaps, maybe,

00:11:35.937 --> 00:11:38.402
because now we don't have these arrangements.

00:11:38.602 --> 00:11:40.608
But that would be a very good idea, too.

00:11:40.633 --> 00:11:46.499
And then thirdly they want to do the the Puja of Shakti, the Mother.

00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:49.272
Because, unless and until you have power,

00:11:49.472 --> 00:11:51.700
even if all the deities are there, you will be exhausted,

00:11:51.901 --> 00:11:53.075
you wouldn't be able to work it out.

00:11:53.276 --> 00:11:57.223
So the third is of your own power, of your Kundalini,

00:11:57.424 --> 00:12:02.307
of the power that is going to work out this Divine work.

00:12:02.533 --> 00:12:03.902
That is how we have three Pujas.

00:12:04.102 --> 00:12:06.863
But none of you should get into an ego trip.

00:12:07.064 --> 00:12:09.440
Please, keep your ego on one side.

00:12:09.641 --> 00:12:13.142
Just now, see for yourself how it works within yourself.

00:12:13.342 --> 00:12:16.877
You start feeling good, you start feeling better vibrations

00:12:17.159 --> 00:12:21.048
and you start feeling much better and healthier within yourself.

00:12:21.248 --> 00:12:24.091
So, just keep your self open. It is you

00:12:24.294 --> 00:12:26.183
who has to achieve something, not Me.

00:12:26.383 --> 00:12:30.267
I don't have to achieve anything. So you better make use of Me.

00:12:30.476 --> 00:12:34.137
Because I am here only for today and then I will go away.

00:12:34.337 --> 00:12:36.017
So, make best use of Me

00:12:36.042 --> 00:12:39.206
and that is why I said as many as possible try to call

00:12:39.407 --> 00:12:41.667
the people over here will be a good idea.

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:42.517
May God Bless you.
