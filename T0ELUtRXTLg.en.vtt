00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:54.420
[Shri&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:32:40.200 --> 01:32:41.460
Mataji’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:16.000
speech&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:49:39.060 --> 01:49:45.990
at 1:53:10]

01:49:45.990 --> 01:49:52.800
[Applause]

01:53:10.920 --> 01:53:14.940
We are all so very thankful to you&nbsp;

01:53:16.920 --> 01:53:24.780
for rendering such a meditative instrument
like this holy vina.

01:53:25.740 --> 01:53:27.180
They know about vina&nbsp;

01:53:28.080 --> 01:53:33.480
and they know that this is one of the&nbsp;
Adivaadyas [primordial instruments].

01:53:33.480 --> 01:53:38.520
Also mridangam [percussions] is an Adivaadya
and ghatam also is Adivaadya.

01:53:39.600 --> 01:53:46.260
I must congratulate the South Indian music style
in which they have maintained those Adivaadya.

01:53:47.100 --> 01:53:55.980
But in the north India, these rhythmic instruments
have taken another form like tabla.

01:53:57.000 --> 01:54:01.860
But mridangam has its own&nbsp;
depth and its own feeding,&nbsp;

01:54:01.860 --> 01:54:07.860
especially for all devotional music,
mridangam is used even in the north.

01:54:09.480 --> 01:54:12.900
Now this is ghatam, you have seen,
it’s like a Kumbha.

01:54:14.220 --> 01:54:18.120
And as you know we call the Kumbha
is where the Kundalini rests.

01:54:19.200 --> 01:54:22.440
And the Shiva is the one who plays the rhythm.

01:54:22.440 --> 01:54:23.033
He is the rhythm.

01:54:23.033 --> 01:54:28.200
He’s the creator of rhythm.
So, this combination is so beautiful!

01:54:29.220 --> 01:54:33.240
And see how simple is this instrument.

01:54:33.780 --> 01:54:37.080
Even look at vina.
It is made from pumpkins&nbsp;

01:54:37.080 --> 01:54:39.120
and that is made from wood.

01:54:40.080 --> 01:54:46.440
Such a simple instrument
and the depth of this culture!

01:54:46.980 --> 01:55:01.380
The depth of these great people, these artists,
is bringing forth such highly evolved&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:55:04.560 --> 01:55:10.783
musical melodies,
that in the West you cannot produce.

01:55:10.783 --> 01:55:12.120
I can tell you this way.

01:55:14.340 --> 01:55:19.660
Look at the rapport between these people
complete rapport.

01:55:20.220 --> 01:55:24.540
There’s no need to tell him anything
or to tell anything,&nbsp;

01:55:24.540 --> 01:55:26.640
nothing to know the notations, nothing.

01:55:26.640 --> 01:55:29.400
Just extra rapport.

01:55:29.400 --> 01:55:32.520
All permutations, combinations, everything.

01:55:33.900 --> 01:55:38.580
Now you are all awakened people,
you are all Realized souls,&nbsp;

01:55:40.260 --> 01:55:44.760
so you are now feeling the AUM within you
so you are appreciating it.

01:55:44.760 --> 01:55:48.180
And I’m sure, if you take to this music,&nbsp;

01:55:48.180 --> 01:55:53.880
you can reach the same heights
and same deeper meanings of life.

01:55:54.840 --> 01:55:59.940
The music was extremely meditative
and the Kundalini was dancing all the time.

01:56:02.160 --> 01:56:04.740
You all enjoyed it.

01:56:04.740 --> 01:56:10.740
We had some great composers,
but they were composers.

01:56:11.880 --> 01:56:15.600
They composed the music
and that was to be produced.

01:56:15.600 --> 01:56:18.720
Here also, the music that he sang&nbsp;

01:56:18.720 --> 01:56:22.740
like bhajans and all that,&nbsp;
are written by great poets,&nbsp;

01:56:22.740 --> 01:56:29.340
also composed, this provision
that you can enlarge it the way you like;

01:56:29.340 --> 01:56:32.040
the permutations and combinations, you can go on.

01:56:33.480 --> 01:56:40.380
This provision was not there
and now as a result of that,&nbsp;

01:56:41.220 --> 01:56:44.880
people are going amok with their music.

01:56:44.880 --> 01:56:50.460
So, we have to understand that the same,
that composition that you had,&nbsp;

01:56:50.460 --> 01:56:59.520
with that, you can create&nbsp;
your own, whole atmosphere.

01:56:59.520 --> 01:57:01.560
For example, like Darbari Kanada.

01:57:03.360 --> 01:57:05.400
It’s a very majestic raga.

01:57:05.940 --> 01:57:08.820
I always felt, on vina,
it would sound better [unclear],&nbsp;

01:57:08.820 --> 01:57:11.400
much more resonance than any other instrument.

01:57:11.400 --> 01:57:14.280
And in Darbari he played,&nbsp;

01:57:14.280 --> 01:57:17.160
really he made the whole Darbar&nbsp;
[Persian word; court] before me.

01:57:18.600 --> 01:57:22.560
Also, the raga like Malkauns,&nbsp;

01:57:23.400 --> 01:57:31.680
all these ragas are very majestic ragas,
better played on vina than on sitar.

01:57:32.760 --> 01:57:37.440
See how many fingers he’s using
how many strings he has to press.

01:57:38.520 --> 01:57:43.800
And they are so unassuming people, so humble.

01:57:45.240 --> 01:57:47.810
As he said, “Vidya vinayena shobhate&nbsp;
[Knowledge graces by humility]”

01:57:47.809 --> 01:57:52.080
if there is ‘vidya’, if there is talent,&nbsp;

01:57:52.080 --> 01:57:55.900
it must have ‘vinaye’,
it must have permit [unsure].

01:57:56.760 --> 01:58:02.460
I hope some of the Sahaja Yogis will take to this
and will pick up these things.

01:58:03.360 --> 01:58:05.640
Why not?
You are all Realised souls.

01:58:05.640 --> 01:58:09.360
Because you are Realised souls,
that’s why you are appreciating this music.

01:58:10.440 --> 01:58:12.210
Otherwise, you could not have. have.

01:58:12.210 --> 01:58:16.860
Because this music comes from Aumkara,
from Chaitanya itself.

01:58:17.580 --> 01:58:20.280
That’s why you appreciating it.

01:58:20.280 --> 01:58:26.460
And as you develop taste for this music,
I’m sure some of you will, one day,&nbsp;

01:58:27.540 --> 01:58:34.800
come to the lotus feet of some great Guru here,
and would produce beautiful music.

01:58:34.800 --> 01:58:37.080
Because this music has not to die.

01:58:39.840 --> 01:58:42.960
You are a great audience,
they appreciated you very much.

01:58:42.960 --> 01:58:49.080
They felt like expressing&nbsp;
themselves more and more.

01:58:49.080 --> 01:58:56.520
And this audience must increase
and this music should go on.

01:58:56.520 --> 01:59:00.680
Like, you had Mozart,
nobody listens to Mozart.

01:59:00.680 --> 01:59:12.605
They had discovered that many tapes
that they had made were not sold, of Mozart.

01:59:12.605 --> 01:59:13.802
[Cut in the video]

01:59:13.802 --> 01:59:15.400
Shinewas Arke Murti.

01:59:18.300 --> 01:59:21.000
Now you see, Arke is the name,
should be taken first,&nbsp;

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:22.440
because that’s the name of his father.

01:59:22.440 --> 01:59:25.962
So, we have.
And the father was mister?&nbsp;

01:59:25.962 --> 01:59:26.912
Musician: Arkesho Murti.
Shri Mataji: Arke?&nbsp;

01:59:26.912 --> 01:59:29.412
Musician: Arishkesho Murti.
Shri Mataji: Aris. Aris?&nbsp;

01:59:29.412 --> 01:59:33.900
Musician: Arishkesho Murti.
Shri Mataji: Arishkesho&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:59:33.900 --> 01:59:34.920
Murti.

01:59:34.920 --> 01:59:37.440
Now this gentleman is a very well-known person.

01:59:37.440 --> 01:59:42.120
He was a ‘Viduana’, [unsure]
it means he was a very scholarly person of vina.

01:59:42.120 --> 01:59:43.320
Very well-known person.

01:59:44.940 --> 01:59:51.780
And then his son is now keeping&nbsp;
the tradition of his father.

01:59:52.740 --> 01:59:56.700
It’s very great and I’m sure
some of the young people&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:59:56.700 --> 02:00:00.780
from this group will come
and would learn this from you.

02:00:16.200 --> 02:00:18.420
[Applause]

02:00:18.420 --> 02:00:25.320
On the mridangam, we have mister Prasanna Kumar.

02:00:25.320 --> 02:00:28.500
I know what is the meaning ‘Prasanna’ is.

02:00:28.500 --> 02:00:37.600
And he really has made me ‘prasanna’ [happy].

02:00:37.600 --> 02:00:45.000
[Applause]

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:48.360
What masterly work he did!
Masterly.

02:00:49.080 --> 02:00:53.280
You have heard tablas,
but you have not heard so much of mridangam.

02:00:53.940 --> 02:00:59.340
And see the depth of it,
the control, the rendering.

02:01:00.180 --> 02:01:04.800
And of all the things,
a complete rapport with the musician.

02:01:05.820 --> 02:01:10.920
Like, in the North Indian music,
if they are playing variations called mukras,&nbsp;

02:01:12.240 --> 02:01:15.480
then the artist just plays the laya,
he doesn’t play the music.

02:01:16.500 --> 02:01:17.760
They are never combined.

02:01:18.480 --> 02:01:23.400
But here, you see, both are combined.
What an understanding it is!

02:01:24.420 --> 02:01:31.620
Same with Mr Dyana, who is a ghatam player.

02:01:32.820 --> 02:01:34.900
He’s just taking-
[Applause]

02:01:52.560 --> 02:01:54.420
I’m very proud of you, sir.

02:01:54.420 --> 02:01:58.860
All of you that you have done&nbsp;
such a great work for me,&nbsp;

02:01:59.520 --> 02:02:03.540
that they have realized what&nbsp;
wealth lies in this country.

02:02:04.440 --> 02:02:07.440
And this is all, comes from Divinity.

02:02:08.280 --> 02:02:10.680
All for Divine, that’s why.

02:02:10.680 --> 02:02:13.680
It’s not meant for something cheapest stuff.

02:02:13.680 --> 02:02:15.720
But it is to please the Divine.

02:02:15.720 --> 02:02:20.940
And that’s why they are so pleased
and so very happy, and they’re all enjoying.

02:02:20.940 --> 02:02:23.165
They don’t care for food, you know, nothing.

02:02:23.165 --> 02:02:23.209
Musician: And mister Subramanyam on tanpura.

02:02:23.209 --> 02:02:23.219
[Laughter]

02:02:23.219 --> 02:02:23.260
Shri Mataji: No, no. You see, do you see?&nbsp;

02:02:23.260 --> 02:02:24.000
[Applause]
Musician: I’m sorry.

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:38.520
Shri Mataji:&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:02:38.520 --> 02:02:43.620
Yes, yes.&nbsp;

02:02:44.340 --> 02:02:50.400
Mr Subramanyam, on tanpura, was playing here,
and was also giving tala (rhythm) all the time.

02:03:02.360 --> 02:03:03.360
[Applause]

02:03:03.360 --> 02:03:07.800
Though the talas are named differently
and have different beats also little bit,&nbsp;

02:03:07.800 --> 02:03:12.780
but they can be compared easily with North Indian,&nbsp;

02:03:12.780 --> 02:03:19.320
like Kaharva (8 beats) and jhaptal (10 beats)
and also you can say, ektal (12 beats).

02:03:19.320 --> 02:03:21.420
So, there is not too much of a difference.

02:03:22.080 --> 02:03:26.520
As some of you are learning&nbsp;
tablas, you should understand&nbsp;

02:03:26.520 --> 02:03:30.540
that it’s very easy to learn from there to this.

02:03:31.500 --> 02:03:37.860
But what I feel more,
that the way he played the music,&nbsp;

02:03:38.520 --> 02:03:44.580
also in the North Indian style,
which is really remarkable, so much.

02:03:44.580 --> 02:03:45.720
It’s very remarkable.

02:03:46.860 --> 02:03:50.580
One day I’ll tell you what is the&nbsp;
difference between the two is.

02:03:50.580 --> 02:03:51.840
You might not have found out.

02:03:52.440 --> 02:03:55.860
And how difficult it must&nbsp;
be for him to play on vina,&nbsp;

02:03:56.880 --> 02:04:00.000
these difficult deep ragas.

02:04:00.720 --> 02:04:01.920
And he has done it.

02:04:02.700 --> 02:04:04.980
So, we have to give him a big hand.

02:04:04.980 --> 02:04:06.072
[Applause]

02:04:06.072 --> 02:04:11.640
If you want, you can see this vina,
ghatam and this&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:04:11.640 --> 02:04:12.300
thing.

02:05:12.300 --> 02:05:18.840
You can see this.
you can come closer and see what it is like.

02:05:18.840 --> 02:05:22.411
Sahaja Yogi: Shri Mataji, Prasanna is his brother.
Musician: He is my brother.&nbsp;

02:05:22.411 --> 02:05:23.447
Shri Mataji: Is he?
Musician: Yes.

02:05:23.447 --> 02:05:28.920
Shri Mataji: What a combination! Wow!
Mr Prasanna Kumar is his brother.

02:05:28.920 --> 02:05:33.453
[Applause]

02:05:33.453 --> 02:05:41.160
I bless you all,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:05:41.160 --> 02:05:42.085
with all my heart,
all my heart.

02:05:42.085 --> 02:05:42.155
Be proud with this service, be proud.

02:05:42.155 --> 02:05:42.248
This is the greatest heritage,
greatest [unclear].

02:05:42.248 --> 02:05:42.296
You should not [unclear].&nbsp;

02:05:42.296 --> 02:05:42.355
You want to see?
Just show them.

02:05:42.355 --> 02:05:42.401
It’s a good [unclear].

02:05:42.400 --> 02:05:42.430
They play tabla.

02:05:42.431 --> 02:05:42.486
Musician: Who plays on tabla?&nbsp;

02:05:42.486 --> 02:05:42.560
You also or somebody?
This is mridangam.

02:05:42.560 --> 02:05:42.684
This is vina, very traditional instrument,
we call Sarasvati vina.

02:05:42.684 --> 02:06:16.980
Shri Mataji: It is different from sitar.
Sitar has 2 threads and&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:06:16.980 --> 02:06:17.790
more notes.

02:06:17.790 --> 02:06:20.326
Musician: We have 24 frets here. 24 frets.

02:06:20.326 --> 02:06:26.249
Shri Mataji: Sitar, you have&nbsp;
18. He has 24. See that.

02:06:26.248 --> 02:06:28.260
And he places the&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:06:28.260 --> 02:06:33.402
two fingers on this,
and sometimes with four fingers also.

02:06:33.402 --> 02:06:38.057
Did you see the notes, how do they sing?

02:06:38.057 --> 02:06:42.130
[Unclear conversation from 2:06:41]

02:06:42.130 --> 02:06:46.320
Sahaja Yogi: What is this?
Musician:&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:06:46.320 --> 02:06:49.340
This is supporting, supporting, to keep this.

02:06:49.340 --> 02:06:52.200
Musician: This is made out of jack&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:06:56.580 --> 02:06:57.360
wood,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:07:04.980 --> 02:07:08.528
jack wood.
This is [unclear], This is metal.

02:07:08.528 --> 02:07:11.713
Shri Mataji: Because [unclear],&nbsp;
much bigger than sitar.

02:07:11.712 --> 02:07:15.360
Sahaja Yogi: Magnetic. Like electric waves.
Musician: Electric.&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:07:15.360 --> 02:07:19.549
Ah yes,
It has vibrations, it has control.

02:07:19.549 --> 02:07:23.760
Musician: It’s all Mataji’s blessing.
Otherwise, we are not as late&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:07:23.760 --> 02:07:29.460
like this.

02:07:44.060 --> 02:07:45.060
[Applause]

02:07:45.060 --> 02:07:46.200
Musician: You would like to see, all of you?

02:07:46.200 --> 02:07:49.265
[Applause]

02:07:49.265 --> 02:07:57.540
Shri Mataji: You have seen&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:07:57.540 --> 02:08:31.860
the picture of Sahaja&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:08:31.860 --> 02:08:33.780
Yogis.&nbsp;

02:08:50.700 --> 02:08:50.988
It’s different from tabla.
This other side.

02:08:50.988 --> 02:08:51.047
Musician: That Divine power is there,
that makes me to play.

02:08:51.047 --> 02:08:51.778
Divine power makes me to play like this.

02:08:51.778 --> 02:08:54.660
I was not playing.
It was only Divine power.

02:08:54.660 --> 02:09:04.087
It was coming from you Mataji.

02:09:04.087 --> 02:09:11.040
[Applause]

02:09:11.040 --> 02:09:18.660
Because you told that.

02:09:18.660 --> 02:09:26.573
Shri Mataji: Yes, of course.
May God bless you all.

02:09:26.572 --> 02:09:31.320
It’s a surprise, isn’t it?&nbsp;

02:09:31.320 --> 02:09:32.340
What a surprise!

02:09:38.940 --> 02:09:41.700
But the larger comes from Shiva.

02:09:41.700 --> 02:10:05.220
Nandi and Shiva and also [unclear],
because, you see, Anahat&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:10:05.220 --> 02:10:05.241
is there.

02:10:05.241 --> 02:10:05.262
Anahat, without note.

02:10:05.262 --> 02:10:05.311
And this is Shiva’s heart.
He resides in Anahat.

02:10:05.311 --> 02:10:08.464
They are all Shivaists
and they worship Shiva very much.

02:10:08.464 --> 02:10:09.535
