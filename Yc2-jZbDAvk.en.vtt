00:01.182 --> 00:05.548
Shri Mataji:﻿…Then he starts treating
people, then he passes negativity more.

00:06.263 --> 00:08.967
And it starts appearing to
be something good, you see.

00:09.230 --> 00:12.300
Sometimes he also feels
that he’s acquired more powers,

00:12.500 --> 00:17.300
because these spirits are very cunning
and they establish that kind of an atmosphere.

00:20.007 --> 00:23.633
So one has to be careful.
There’s a regular warfare going on.

00:25.056 --> 00:29.133
And that’s why we have to
just keep our spirits all right.

00:29.333 --> 00:31.967
And cowardice has no place in this war.

00:34.547 --> 00:38.774
The whole thing will work out very
well if people are identified with the Truth.

00:39.007 --> 00:42.340
But Truth, as you know, is
very difficult to be identified with;

00:42.541 --> 00:46.300
very difficult for human beings,
absolutely next to impossible.

00:46.500 --> 00:49.300
If you tell them to be idiots, they’ll accept you.

00:49.722 --> 00:52.133
If you tell them to be stupid, they’ll accept you.

00:52.333 --> 00:57.800
Any sort of a thing that makes them
look absolutely donkeys, they will do it.

00:58.493 --> 01:01.061
If you tell them to be false, they will do it.

01:01.261 --> 01:04.060
If you create any atmosphere
of falsehood, they’ll accept you.

01:04.260 --> 01:08.300
But the truth? Very difficult. Very difficult.

01:08.831 --> 01:12.438
Even you will know there are
some people that see my photograph

01:12.638 --> 01:16.300
and they get the cool breeze, but
then when they see me fully, they cannot.

01:16.500 --> 01:19.800
Because when they see the photograph
there’s a lot of darkness still in them.

01:20.000 --> 01:24.854
So they believe into me because of that part of
that is darkness, because I’m just a photograph.

01:25.055 --> 01:28.300
But as soon as they see me
they just don’t want to accept me.

01:31.348 --> 01:37.633
We had a very nice place in Delhi:

01:37.833 --> 01:43.320
I asked Gregoire to go and
speak to the girls of Delhi University.

01:43.667 --> 01:49.659
Him being a young white person and handsome
and all that, they were all very much impressed.

01:49.860 --> 01:55.300
And with that thing, I mean, he was saying that there’s
somebody like that. And they were feeling the vibrations all right.

01:55.500 --> 01:57.967
But when they came to me
they never felt any vibrations.

01:58.167 --> 02:01.467
Just imagine! From Gregoire
they were feeling, not from me!

02:03.000 --> 02:06.467
But then they recovered from it
and now they are much better off.

02:06.667 --> 02:08.667
But this was the thing.

02:09.166 --> 02:12.483
So, because of this, you see,

02:12.737 --> 02:18.052
the people who represent darkness
and falsehood are more successful.

02:18.377 --> 02:22.133
The spiritualists are much
more successful than a saint.

02:29.714 --> 02:31.980
Yogi: I never had to pay any money.

02:32.180 --> 02:34.922
Shri Mataji: This can be
also because they do not know;

02:35.122 --> 02:39.401
they are very intentioned, they think
they have got powers. You are human.

02:39.601 --> 02:43.800
And by that they have a satisfaction to
say that, “We are doing good to others.”

02:44.000 --> 02:47.122
But they do not know the
know-how, you see. That is the point.

02:47.322 --> 02:52.633
Because here the people are not
that cunning as we have in India.

02:53.063 --> 02:56.633
If they know that they are
doing harm, they would not do it.

02:57.046 --> 02:59.660
We have very cunning people in our country:

02:59.860 --> 03:04.633
even if they know they are doing harm, still
they’ll do it if they can get some money out of you.

03:04.834 --> 03:07.036
So they haven’t got any conscience about it.

03:07.236 --> 03:13.126
So, here if the people see that they have
done good to someone then they start doing it,

03:13.326 --> 03:16.133
thinking they have powers, this, that.

03:16.333 --> 03:22.630
Because sometimes also they get
a vision, sometimes they get a feeling:

03:22.830 --> 03:27.300
all these things can be there
due to these spirits coming in.

03:28.496 --> 03:31.868
In India it is a very common
experience of many people.

03:32.069 --> 03:34.648
They worship a deity all the time,

03:34.848 --> 03:40.710
and suddenly they find the garland
that they put into the neck of the deity

03:40.911 --> 03:43.647
gets up from there and comes into their own necks.

03:43.847 --> 03:49.133
Then they think, “Now God has accepted
us as great saints!” Finished! This is their idea.

03:49.333 --> 03:54.671
Now it is nothing but some
dissatisfied soul who puts it on them.

03:54.871 --> 03:58.300
And they start believing into
it, that it is God who has done it.

03:58.500 --> 04:02.546
Then they will start a big place
and will announce to everyone that,

04:02.746 --> 04:07.714
“I am a saint and this will happen and that will happen.”
And people are also impressed with this kind of thing.

04:07.914 --> 04:11.467
And they would again ask for this thing to happen.

04:11.667 --> 04:17.633
There are people who start getting
this red kumkum from their hands flowing.

04:18.364 --> 04:20.400
So people believe into it. They think that,

04:20.600 --> 04:24.509
“Yes, must be something great, otherwise how
can this red powder flowing from their hands?”

04:24.710 --> 04:26.892
Or sometimes ashes start.

04:27.093 --> 04:32.133
And we have got, say in Bombay we have a temple,

04:32.944 --> 04:35.854
we have a temple of Mahalakshmi,

04:36.055 --> 04:42.262
and they think that Mahalakshmi temple
is the place where the Goddess resides.

04:42.462 --> 04:45.600
No doubt there is a very,

04:46.795 --> 04:51.485
genuine temple,

04:51.686 --> 04:55.300
I would say - Not temple, but
even the statue is absolutely genuine.

04:55.500 --> 04:59.379
But the people who are there are so funny

05:00.317 --> 05:05.800
that they get hold of some maid
servants and then spirits comes into them.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.247
They start doing, “Hooo, huuu,” like that.

05:08.447 --> 05:15.861
This is called as dhagni tirani:
means there’s a big pot you get for water.

05:16.350 --> 05:22.055
And in that water they go on saying,
“Huuuun, huuuun,” inside the waters,

05:22.893 --> 05:25.300
and they get those spirits into them.

05:25.500 --> 05:27.866
And then they go on, “Huuuun, huuuun,” like that.

05:28.066 --> 05:32.404
All the people go on like
that, all these maid servants.

05:32.605 --> 05:35.836
And then these people come and ask them questions,

05:36.036 --> 05:40.800
like, “What is the horse we are going
to get?” “Where is my brother?” All this.

05:41.000 --> 05:45.361
And they answer, then they
believe into it. So they get some money.

05:45.561 --> 05:49.449
But these women are
horrible women in their own lives

05:49.731 --> 05:54.467
and they are always sick
and they are very unhappy.

05:54.667 --> 05:58.376
But they believe into it.

05:58.576 --> 06:01.467
They believe into all these things and they do it.

06:01.667 --> 06:05.738
And while doing it, they don’t know
that they are doing anything wrong.

06:05.938 --> 06:08.967
But they get sick and they are very, very unhappy,

06:09.731 --> 06:12.467
and ultimately they die a very bad death.

06:12.938 --> 06:18.467
There was one like that in Poona,
whom they called as Mamaji, means uncle.

06:18.667 --> 06:21.467
And he was a very, very famous man in Poona.

06:21.667 --> 06:26.300
Even the police used to use
that man for doing this spirits’ job.

06:26.500 --> 06:29.800
But they knew that those were
spirits and these are not Gods.

06:30.000 --> 06:34.467
Only these women, the way they do it, they
think it is the Goddess that has come into them.

06:34.667 --> 06:38.467
Now Goddess should have some sense
to come into these horrible women, isn’t it!

06:38.667 --> 06:41.686
But people don’t think
about it; so they believe into it.

06:41.886 --> 06:44.967
But this man, this gentleman who was in Poona,

06:45.167 --> 06:48.800
because I was staying with
the police commissioner there,

06:49.079 --> 06:53.380
the police commissioner called
him and so he came and he told me,

06:53.580 --> 06:58.204
“Mother, I really wanted to meet You for one reason
that I’m now fed up of these spirits that I have used,

06:58.405 --> 07:03.133
and if You could get rid of them I’ll be very
happy, because now I’m being tortured by them.

07:03.333 --> 07:05.835
And I know what sort of
a death I am going to have:

07:06.035 --> 07:11.565
they are going to eat my flesh one by
one and I’m going to die much earlier,

07:12.000 --> 07:14.702
before my death, the way
they will torture my life.”

07:14.903 --> 07:18.705
So all this, you see, he was frightened about,

07:18.905 --> 07:22.154
because he had seen other also
people who did this kind of work.

07:22.354 --> 07:25.545
Tantrikas, suffering.
So he was very much frightened.

07:25.936 --> 07:30.300
So I said, “All right, then you ask
for the Parama,” means the highest.

07:30.500 --> 07:33.967
“You ask for that superior thing, superior most.”

07:34.168 --> 07:37.231
He said, “All right, I ask for it.”

07:37.431 --> 07:39.778
I said, “All right, say it
thrice that you ask for it.”

07:39.978 --> 07:43.061
He said, “Yes, give me that,
Mother. Give me that. Give me that.”

07:43.786 --> 07:47.967
I said, “All right, I’ll give you that.”
And he got his realisation, to start with.

07:48.167 --> 07:50.257
He got the vibrations above all that.

07:50.457 --> 07:53.840
I said, “Now you have lost all these
horrible bhoots and their powers

07:54.040 --> 07:58.111
and now you’ll have your own
powers coming in and they will act.

07:58.312 --> 08:04.134
These, your own, powers will act which
you can be able to manoeuvre and help others.”

08:05.164 --> 08:08.788
He could not believe in me. He thought
that whatever he had for twenty-five years,

08:08.988 --> 08:11.133
how can he get rid of them just like this?

08:11.333 --> 08:15.501
So he went to the police commissioner and
told him that, “Oh, Mataji is telling me like this.

08:15.701 --> 08:18.892
I don’t believe it. I can
always call those spirits.”

08:19.092 --> 08:24.967
The police used to use him
for detecting crimes and things.

08:25.724 --> 08:31.133
So he said, “All right, if you think so, why
not call one of the spirits? Say your mantra.”

08:31.333 --> 08:36.297
He started saying mantras, nobody would come in.
He tried for half an hour, nobody would come in.

08:36.497 --> 08:39.306
He said, “Do you mean to say
I’ve lost all that?” I said, “Yes.”

08:39.506 --> 08:44.133
I said, “Now thank your stars you will have
better death at least!” That’s how it works out.

08:44.626 --> 08:49.453
But even in Sahaja Yoga you will be
surprised, in the beginning of Sahaja Yoga,

08:51.896 --> 08:54.417
even in the beginning of Sahaja Yoga…

09:01.453 --> 09:07.467
Shri Mataji: Regis, tell him how to sit with his left
hand towards me and right hand outside: this gentleman.

09:09.072 --> 09:11.300
No, near the door.

09:14.539 --> 09:18.601
He’s a great believer in the
Goddess. He’s a Devi bhakta.

09:23.690 --> 09:31.204
…So, it so happened that I went to America.

09:31.405 --> 09:33.640
Before going to America I told this lady that,

09:33.840 --> 09:38.279
“You are all right but your guru has
been doing all these tricks of spirits.

09:38.480 --> 09:42.148
So you will get those spirits into
you, and it will try to entice you.

09:42.348 --> 09:44.534
Because they don’t want to give up their people.

09:44.734 --> 09:49.733
They have no freedom and once they try
to get out, they just try to again entice you.”

09:50.037 --> 09:55.233
So she told me, “No, no. You just don’t
worry about me Mother I’ll keep myself all right.”

09:55.703 --> 09:59.233
Then, you know, in her own house she started a centre.

09:59.504 --> 10:01.233
She put up my big photograph.

10:01.433 --> 10:07.567
And people who come to her and she started
first giving them Sahaja Yoga and this and that.

10:07.767 --> 10:11.900
And then suddenly she started
feeling something falling from her hands.

10:12.100 --> 10:20.067
And they were some rice,

10:20.267 --> 10:25.733
the rice which is being reddened
by this kumkum: we call it as akshata.

10:25.933 --> 10:30.310
And she was so surprised at it,
that it has started falling from her.

10:30.510 --> 10:36.067
And gradually everybody was surprised and
they said lots of people started coming to her.

10:36.267 --> 10:39.426
Then they started asking her questions like,

10:39.627 --> 10:44.240
“Where is my brother?” “Where is my
father?” “What is the horse?” this, that.

10:44.441 --> 10:49.733
And she started answering that, that, “You know,
horse is going to win this race.” And they won that race.

10:49.933 --> 10:53.653
One fellow had put lot of money
somewhere and he had forgotten about it,

10:53.853 --> 10:56.733
in a big house, so she told also, where is the money.

10:56.933 --> 11:01.204
And they were all very much impressed
because they are very materialistic people.

11:01.405 --> 11:06.567
They are only interested in what money we are
going to get, or what health problems they have.

11:06.767 --> 11:11.207
They are not interested in Self-realisation.
Very, I should say, low-graded people they are.

11:11.407 --> 11:14.567
So they were just worried about
this, not worried about Self-realisation.

11:14.767 --> 11:20.067
And all such people started coming to her who were
not interested in Self-realisation but in all these things.

11:20.267 --> 11:24.233
And she became very popular;
she became so popular that there were,

11:24.433 --> 11:26.567
sometimes used to be three thousand people,

11:27.004 --> 11:29.214
and she had to take a hall and this and that.

11:29.414 --> 11:33.720
And I came to know about it somehow within myself

11:33.920 --> 11:36.567
and I immediately sent a telegram to her saying that,

11:36.767 --> 11:40.067
“Please stop all that nonsense
and please don’t do all this.”

11:40.267 --> 11:44.233
And she could not believe in this.

11:44.433 --> 11:49.900
Then when I went to India, about a
month later, she had not yet stopped.

11:50.100 --> 11:55.315
And by that time what had happened, she said,
“No, Mataji came to me and she told me that, carry on.

11:55.515 --> 11:58.567
I saw her standing before
me, she said so,” and all that.

11:58.767 --> 12:03.900
In that short time that I was there,
I mean one month or so I was not there,

12:04.123 --> 12:07.187
she started using a big whips

12:07.388 --> 12:11.733
and a big stick to hit people,
“To take out their devils,” she said.

12:11.933 --> 12:15.400
And she used to hit them very badly on their backs.

12:15.600 --> 12:20.280
And it was so horrible that
some people broke their backs

12:20.480 --> 12:23.143
and all sorts of things
happening, she was using a stick,

12:23.343 --> 12:26.461
and sometimes a very flexible one,

12:26.662 --> 12:29.972
so that they would get marks on their body.

12:30.426 --> 12:34.087
By the time I reached she came to see me,

12:34.287 --> 12:37.067
and some of the Sahaja
Yogis joined hands with her.

12:37.267 --> 12:41.901
It was so silly that I just could not understand
how these people all joined hands with her.

12:42.102 --> 12:44.024
And then she came to me and she said,

12:44.224 --> 12:48.145
“I have started a very big organisation in Your
name Mother. You must come. You must come.”

12:48.346 --> 12:53.067
So I told the Sahaja yogis, “None of you
need come. I will go myself.” So I went down.

12:53.790 --> 12:57.677
She came and she opened the door
of my thing, she washed my feet and

12:57.877 --> 13:03.067
lots of water she brought and then she
washed my feet with milk and all sorts of things.

13:03.267 --> 13:07.900
I was just feeling very embarrassed, you know,
about the whole thing! I didn’t know what to do.

13:08.100 --> 13:13.900
I went up to the room and she made me sit down there and all these people were singing my praise, this, that.

13:14.100 --> 13:20.233
I was very embarrassed: everywhere I could see all these horrible, these spirits sitting down there and mocking at me.

13:20.433 --> 13:25.655
I said, “You are going to be eat a great lout.”

13:26.750 --> 13:31.067
And I didn’t know what to do
and how to tell them about this.

13:31.267 --> 13:35.195
And then they started saying, “Hoooon!
Hoooon!” I said, “I have had it now here!”

13:35.396 --> 13:38.384
I said, “All right, I am all right. I am
going back.” She said, “We’ll do your puja.”

13:38.584 --> 13:42.028
I said, “No, no, you are not well. I’m
going back home, you come and see me there.”

13:42.229 --> 13:44.824
She was very happy. Next day she
came, she thought I was going to say,

13:45.024 --> 13:47.733
“Oh, bravo. You have done very well.”

13:47.933 --> 13:50.113
So when she came and sat next to me she said,

13:50.314 --> 13:55.067
“Now see, Mother, see how many
powers You have given me. I am so powerful!”

13:55.267 --> 13:59.770
I said, “Really? I must say you have
some powers isn’t it?” She said, “Yes.”

13:59.970 --> 14:02.733
I said, “All right, will you
tell this gentleman about him?”

14:02.933 --> 14:07.676
So she started telling him that, “You were
born in such a place and you have a house like this.”

14:07.877 --> 14:10.984
He said, “Not me. It’s not me.
You are telling about somebody else.”

14:11.184 --> 14:18.157
Then there was a lady sitting there.
She said, “You are a person who has got a clerk,

14:18.357 --> 14:21.233
in your business who is like this, whose name is this.”

14:21.433 --> 14:24.567
She said, “I don’t have a business. I don’t have a clerk.”

14:24.768 --> 14:29.067
She looked at me. She said, “Mother,
have you taken away all my powers?”

14:29.331 --> 14:33.400
I said, “If they were your powers I
would have respected you and loved you.

14:33.600 --> 14:35.567
But these were somebody else’s powers.

14:35.767 --> 14:39.119
As soon as you have entered into
my house they have left you completely.

14:39.319 --> 14:41.635
And now you go back you can get them back again,

14:41.835 --> 14:45.900
unless and until you say that I want
the eternal, the eternal, and eternal.

14:46.100 --> 14:48.910
And after this you have to be very, very particular

14:49.110 --> 14:54.706
and watch yourself, your attention, whether
you are accepting these negativities or not.”

14:54.907 --> 14:58.400
She said, “Yes, I want the
eternal, eternal and eternal.”

14:58.600 --> 15:02.992
And she was all right, and she went back
home and she was all right for about fifteen days.

15:03.192 --> 15:08.067
But you see, popularity of that kind is
very difficult, to avoid the temptations.

15:08.267 --> 15:11.444
That’s why it is said, “Lead us not into temptation,”

15:11.945 --> 15:15.214
with that same thing, “but deliver us from evil,”

15:15.414 --> 15:20.233
for the same reason: because evil is
standing in every corner you walk through.

15:20.433 --> 15:23.567
And she fell into this. And when she fell into this,

15:23.767 --> 15:28.900
she started another organisation of her own and she started this and that, and she was so frantic.

15:29.100 --> 15:34.900
Nowadays, for your information, she’s
a very serious patient in a lunatic asylum.

15:40.480 --> 15:43.912
So, human beings are like
that: they take to such things.

15:44.112 --> 15:49.382
I mean, that time only about one hundred and fifty
or two hundred people used to come and meet me,

15:49.582 --> 15:51.826
while she was getting three thousand.

15:53.363 --> 15:58.400
People want darkness, they want falsehood,
they want that somebody should hoodwink them.

15:58.600 --> 16:00.426
They want somebody should befool them.

16:00.626 --> 16:02.733
They want to live with the befooling, you see.

16:02.933 --> 16:07.500
And those who know this and know how
to handle it, they’ll just keep you on the run.

16:07.700 --> 16:09.738
They will keep you on the run all the time,

16:09.938 --> 16:13.327
that you’ll be befooled you from this
place to that place, and that place to that place.

16:13.528 --> 16:17.328
Now, there can be people who
are extremely simple-hearted.

16:17.925 --> 16:22.567
But the simplicity goes to this limit
that they cannot recognise the reality.

16:22.767 --> 16:27.067
You have to be in the centre
otherwise you can become a simpleton.

16:27.267 --> 16:31.900
And that simpleton-ness can really be very killing.

16:32.100 --> 16:34.952
But if the person is say, very intelligent,

16:35.152 --> 16:38.560
he relies on his intelligence,
then they will play on your intelligence.

16:38.761 --> 16:41.334
They will pump up your ego.

16:41.534 --> 16:46.589
They’ll do this and do that, and somehow or the other they
will get you there, because they are extremely cunning people.

16:46.790 --> 16:49.257
They are the embodiment of cunningness.

16:49.782 --> 16:51.611
So you cannot outwit them

16:51.811 --> 16:54.492
because whatever intelligence you have is limited

16:54.692 --> 17:00.400
while they have such a lot of intelligence of such
a crooked nature that you cannot go to their level.

17:00.600 --> 17:02.567
After all, you have your conscience with you.

17:02.767 --> 17:06.185
So they have no conscience and they play about so much

17:06.633 --> 17:09.900
that they really hoodwink you
and you do not know about it.

17:10.100 --> 17:17.832
And that’s how you will find that all the
incarnations who came on this Earth were killed,

17:18.033 --> 17:22.008
crucified, poisoned, like Mohammed Sahib was poisoned;

17:22.366 --> 17:29.849
or harassed, or sent to forests like Rama;

17:30.191 --> 17:34.233
and Krishna: tortured by many
rakshasas who went to kill him.

17:34.433 --> 17:38.567
All sorts of things. I mean, there is
no incarnation who has not suffered.

17:38.767 --> 17:43.233
So that now people think that if
you do not suffer you cannot go to God.

17:43.433 --> 17:47.900
This is another madness people
have, that you must suffer to go to God.

17:48.100 --> 17:50.233
So they are all carrying the cross.

17:50.536 --> 17:54.067
It was for Christ to carry
the cross, not for you people.

17:54.267 --> 17:57.076
So there is no need for you to be that miserable

17:57.276 --> 17:59.233
and take the sufferings upon yourself.

17:59.433 --> 18:01.780
There’s no need at all to suffer.

18:01.980 --> 18:06.733
There is no need at all to
unnecessarily torture your bodies,

18:06.933 --> 18:09.989
unnecessarily torture your being to such a limit

18:10.189 --> 18:14.792
that you are absolutely useless for the
day when you are going to be crowned.

18:15.124 --> 18:16.871
Come here, come in!

18:17.726 --> 18:20.067
Let him have a chair…

18:23.330 --> 18:28.067
So this is what I tell you: that
falsehood is easily acceptable to people.

18:28.267 --> 18:34.067
People accept falsehood with
such gusto and with such force

18:34.267 --> 18:37.733
and they do not even see what
is happening, they just rush to it.

18:37.933 --> 18:40.233
Because we have lived with it.

18:40.534 --> 18:42.926
First of all you have lived with matter.

18:43.126 --> 18:48.650
We are identified with it because we have lived
with it, because we do not know what is the Truth.

18:48.851 --> 18:52.651
We have lived with untruth.
We have lived with the dreams.

18:52.852 --> 18:55.152
We have not lived with the awakened state.

18:55.353 --> 18:58.067
We are not yet identified with that awakened state.

18:58.267 --> 19:01.611
That’s why you are awakened, then you go off to sleep.

19:01.811 --> 19:04.067
Again you are awakened, again you go off to sleep.

19:04.267 --> 19:08.666
You are more identified with
sleep than with awakened state:

19:08.867 --> 19:11.449
that’s why it happens all the time.

19:11.650 --> 19:16.900
Sometimes people say, “Mother, Sahaja Yoga
also, when we get realisation again we go down.”

19:17.100 --> 19:19.067
But what can we do?

19:19.469 --> 19:21.961
You see, it’s not the responsibility of Sahaja Yoga

19:22.161 --> 19:26.233
that it should just shoot you off to that place.

19:26.433 --> 19:31.571
It is also your responsibility in a way,
that if you have had problems within you

19:31.980 --> 19:37.930
and there are pouches and ditches where you
are physically hurt, mentally hurt, everybody hurt.

19:38.130 --> 19:43.656
So then what happens? That power which has really touched on top, goes back and tries to establish it.

19:43.857 --> 19:47.733
It happens like that, so nothing
to feel bad: it will again come up.

19:47.933 --> 19:49.876
It has to make your instrument all right,

19:50.076 --> 19:53.676
because your instrument
has gone into horrible things.

19:53.877 --> 20:01.067
Especially very funny habits one develops
by these horrible devils coming into you.

20:01.267 --> 20:04.733
Even a person, if he drinks too
much, then know that he’s possessed.

20:05.234 --> 20:10.329
If a person he talks very much, or he jabbers,

20:10.530 --> 20:13.223
or he’s harsh, then know that he’s possessed.

20:13.423 --> 20:18.879
All the time if he has a habit to snap at someone,

20:19.227 --> 20:24.067
shout at someone, or strict at someone
then know that he is a possessed man.

20:24.361 --> 20:27.326
Or if he has a habit to be quiet unnecessarily,

20:27.526 --> 20:30.900
he tries to be quiet all the time,
then know that he’s possessed.

20:31.100 --> 20:37.067
Any extreme behaviour is only caused by spirits.

20:37.656 --> 20:40.640
Actually what happens that, when we go to the extremes,

20:40.840 --> 20:43.233
our human awareness cannot bear it.

20:43.433 --> 20:47.732
Then what happens that we
just ask for help from outside.

20:47.933 --> 20:52.900
And there are many busybodies around:
they just enter into you and start munching.

20:54.004 --> 21:00.733
There is no need to strain your being so much and go to extremes. You have to be just in the centre.

21:00.933 --> 21:03.896
Actually, this country or any of the Western countries,

21:04.096 --> 21:06.999
I thought, would have been very
good for you because you are saints

21:07.199 --> 21:11.900
and that you would have
lived with a very temperate life.

21:12.100 --> 21:17.442
There was not such problems as we had in
India, or in any other developing countries.

21:17.643 --> 21:23.149
I thought you will be much better off
here, but, on the contrary, what I find:

21:23.349 --> 21:28.567
the material life that provided
everything for you, made a slave out of you.

21:28.767 --> 21:31.424
You even have habits of matter!

21:31.735 --> 21:37.462
Now when you have habits of matters,
there are some other habits can be put into you.

21:37.663 --> 21:39.900
And the habits that are put into you by these…

21:40.100 --> 21:42.873
Shri Mataji: Just keep your hands like this.

21:43.073 --> 21:45.675
Yogi: He’s very badly damaged.

21:45.875 --> 21:52.900
Shri Mataji: Very bad? All right, you put your left hand. You can stand or put your left hand inside...

21:58.331 --> 22:00.785
He’s from the same course as you have been (TM)

22:00.985 --> 22:07.295
and he has been jumping all the time, poor
thing. You can go there, in the door where Hesta is.

22:10.148 --> 22:15.400
And he has really hurt himself. All of
them are hurt in their bones, all of them.

22:17.465 --> 22:26.400
Any man who has left no
sense of.. you can say the dharma,

22:26.600 --> 22:30.733
or of his balances is a man who is possessed.

22:31.243 --> 22:35.287
Anyone who is doing a crime

22:35.487 --> 22:39.233
which he does not understand is also possessed.

22:39.593 --> 22:45.400
Or a human being, say a man having a
relation with a man, is a possessed condition.

22:46.179 --> 22:50.733
If a woman has relations with a
woman, it is a possessed condition.

22:50.933 --> 22:54.233
It is not a condition of a normal person.

22:54.433 --> 22:56.742
And human beings have to be normal human beings.

22:56.942 --> 22:59.779
If a woman, if she doesn’t care for her chastity

22:59.979 --> 23:02.900
and she leads a fast life that means she’s possessed.

23:03.100 --> 23:06.548
If she goes about with many
men that means she’s possessed.

23:06.748 --> 23:08.900
If the men do that they are also possessed.

23:09.100 --> 23:11.370
They cannot be normal people who do all this.

23:11.570 --> 23:17.567
You see, whatever are the sustenance of
human beings are also the powers of human beings.

23:17.767 --> 23:22.268
Like that, we can see the people who are in the centre,

23:23.070 --> 23:29.233
the people who are sustained, they do not have all these
temptations. I mean, they just don’t like it. They are just normal people.

23:29.433 --> 23:33.973
And that is what one loses gradually
by doing extremes. And you don’t even realise.

23:34.174 --> 23:37.233
The whole society could be
like that: possessed, with ideas.

23:37.433 --> 23:40.067
You can see what foolish
things we are doing in this country.

23:40.346 --> 23:43.825
I know in India they do all sorts of nonsensical things:

23:44.750 --> 23:48.896
like telling lies, and cheating people,

23:49.096 --> 23:51.996
fraud and all that is very common in India.

23:52.197 --> 23:54.246
But here the other things are there.

23:54.446 --> 24:00.406
Like the way we are wasting our
energy in nonsensical things about sex

24:00.606 --> 24:05.485
and about flirting and all this nonsense.

24:05.685 --> 24:10.716
Flirting is nothing but a virus infection of sex.

24:10.917 --> 24:12.751
Your eyes are caught up.

24:12.951 --> 24:17.733
Really, it is the infection of the
eyes, and it comes into the eye, you see.

24:17.933 --> 24:22.373
Then you start looking here and there. You don’t know what
you are looking. Flirting, if you ask them, they have no joy in it.

24:22.573 --> 24:25.900
They just see around. They see one
place to another, one woman to another.

24:26.100 --> 24:28.426
Then the woman catches it, the woman gets it.

24:28.626 --> 24:31.900
You are just looking like this. You don’t
know why. It’s a such a waste of energy.

24:32.100 --> 24:34.200
Actually, I didn’t know what was flirting.

24:34.400 --> 24:38.762
But once, when I went to America, in
seventy-three, a young boy came to me and he said,

24:38.962 --> 24:42.465
“Mother, why do I look at all these
women? I waste such a lot of energy.

24:42.665 --> 24:45.084
Why can’t I keep straight?
What is the need to look at them?”

24:45.284 --> 24:47.803
They do not know anything to it: any woman passing.

24:48.003 --> 24:52.372
Then the woman also would dress up in such
a way that she would attract somebody else.

24:53.417 --> 24:56.400
So that this is also another kind of fraternity working.

24:56.600 --> 25:02.733
And the whole game starts. We find even in places like
people are above sixty years, they do the same nonsense.

25:03.029 --> 25:06.207
It’s something surprising that even they are not mature,

25:06.407 --> 25:10.567
because if you get this poison
into you then you do not mature.

25:10.767 --> 25:14.373
It’s like any fruit which is infected cannot mature.

25:14.573 --> 25:17.425
It’s an infection and when it
comes into you, you do not mature.

25:17.625 --> 25:21.676
That’s why you find even
eighty-year-old people behaving like,

25:21.876 --> 25:26.567
just like silly young twenty-five year olds.

25:27.130 --> 25:31.874
That sort of people you find, so commonly here,
where you go. You feel so ashamed and embarrassed.

25:32.076 --> 25:37.476
And a eighty-year-old woman starts telling you about
her love affairs and you just don’t know where to look!

25:37.676 --> 25:41.567
And it’s very common. They
boast of it and they talk like that.

25:41.767 --> 25:44.667
Their talking is so funny that you can’t imagine.

25:44.867 --> 25:49.733
It’s most embarrassing the way they
talk about things and the way they live.

25:49.933 --> 25:52.384
There was a lady who told me:

25:52.897 --> 26:00.626
she is a lady of a good family and an ambassador’s wife,

26:00.826 --> 26:05.123
and she told me there’s a very great
writer here, she was about eighty years of age

26:05.323 --> 26:08.124
and she writes lots of books on philosophy and things.

26:08.325 --> 26:13.400
So she invited this lady, the
ambassador’s wife, for a lunch party.

26:13.600 --> 26:16.976
And she said, “Why lunch? I could
come for dinner with my husband.”

26:17.176 --> 26:21.064
She said, “No, no, no. I want you for lunch
and give you a nice time. I’ll get you a boyfriend.”

26:21.267 --> 26:24.717
She said, “Are you joking?” She said, “No, I have one, my own:

26:24.917 --> 26:28.016
about twenty-four years.
And what years’ age do you want?”

26:28.216 --> 26:31.306
She was shocked. She said,
“What? I don’t want all that.”

26:31.506 --> 26:36.900
She said, “You must know. You see, you women are no good.
Eastern women are no good. You must learn how to enjoy life!”

26:37.100 --> 26:42.733
She said, “I am sorry. I am not to learn that!” And she just put down the phone. Now this lady is writing books on philosophy!

26:47.115 --> 26:53.900
See the stupidity to which people are taking. And she is one of the most successful writers in England.

26:54.100 --> 26:57.525
I don’t know her name. She didn’t
tell me the name. But this is what it is.

26:57.726 --> 27:00.614
She’s successful because she is spreading darkness.

27:01.195 --> 27:04.079
Because people want to live with whatever they were.

27:04.279 --> 27:08.890
They were in darkness, they were just
matter: this dead matter is just darkness.

27:09.091 --> 27:11.397
It has no awareness in it.

27:11.597 --> 27:14.406
Then the animals have a little bit of awareness.

27:14.652 --> 27:20.506
And they come to a point when they are human beings.
They have passed through millions of years with that ignorance

27:20.706 --> 27:26.479
and that darkness and they more
adhere to it than to something that is beyond.

27:26.680 --> 27:31.900
They only evolve because God’s grace is
there, otherwise they would never have evolved.

27:32.100 --> 27:36.155
Because God has put some sort of a
seeking in their stomach that for food,

27:36.355 --> 27:39.400
for other things, they start evolving.

27:39.600 --> 27:43.738
And when they start evolving they
reach a stage of human consciousness.

27:43.938 --> 27:50.010
Now at human consciousness if I have to say
that you have to face the reality, why should you?

27:51.369 --> 27:55.400
You think that, “If I have to face
reality then I have to work for it.”

27:55.600 --> 27:57.943
Because that is another thing you have done so far.

27:58.143 --> 28:01.988
You think that you have
done something all the time to achieve something,

28:02.188 --> 28:04.692
if you have to achieve
something then you must put in effort.

28:04.893 --> 28:08.233
Then you do not want to take
that path when you were dark.

28:08.433 --> 28:10.794
We have done nothing to become a human being,

28:10.994 --> 28:14.567
and that, if we have to go further
we are not to do anything about it.

28:14.767 --> 28:18.130
On the contrary you start running fast, very fast,

28:18.330 --> 28:22.599
and if you know the phrase that, “You
take two running jumps and go to hell”.

28:22.925 --> 28:26.805
It’s like that, for example. And
you speed up so much on that,

28:27.005 --> 28:29.567
that then you land into difficulty.

28:31.513 --> 28:36.482
That’s why it is necessary to
understand that you are human beings

28:36.682 --> 28:40.067
and at this time you have
given freedom, absolute freedom.

28:40.267 --> 28:46.233
Because you have to see your own evolution.

28:49.147 --> 28:52.233
Because you are free you can see it.

28:52.433 --> 28:56.702
If you were part and
parcel of God and if He had done for you,

28:57.576 --> 29:01.042
then you would not have seen it, like animals have not.

29:01.243 --> 29:04.900
But this you have to see and you have to be aware of it.

29:05.100 --> 29:07.713
That’s why you have been given freedom.

29:08.576 --> 29:12.567
If you are not away from me how will you see me?

29:15.147 --> 29:19.067
And this is the reason you
were separated from The Whole,

29:19.267 --> 29:22.733
so that you can see that you become The Whole.

29:24.107 --> 29:27.784
While the animals do not see it because they are dark.

29:28.838 --> 29:34.067
They are part of The Whole, they
are looked after, they live like that,

29:34.760 --> 29:37.678
they don’t get ego, they don’t get superego,

29:37.879 --> 29:42.567
they do not speed up suddenly, they
do not do all these things, as you do.

29:42.767 --> 29:45.233
They do not have insurances!

29:48.957 --> 29:54.206
They are sensible, we think. So we go down
to them and want to learn something from them.

29:54.406 --> 29:57.663
And what do we learn from
them? Their sex behaviour! Imagine.

29:57.863 --> 30:02.041
This is human brain, specially made: real clowns!

30:02.885 --> 30:05.737
The way we look at things I don’t know how:

30:06.018 --> 30:09.722
whatever is to be done we just
do in the other way round style.

30:09.922 --> 30:12.511
Like, what you have to learn from animals

30:12.711 --> 30:15.900
that they are one with The Whole,
the trees are one with The Whole.

30:16.100 --> 30:19.184
When there is spring the
trees will bring out yellow flowers,

30:19.384 --> 30:22.521
when there is the summer
they’ll bring out the red flowers,

30:22.721 --> 30:25.067
and that’s how they express the colours.

30:25.647 --> 30:32.233
While they are looked after: whether they
are here or anywhere, they are looked after.

30:32.433 --> 30:35.733
The nature looks after them.
There is a circle between them.

30:35.933 --> 30:40.000
If the trees have the leaves..

30:40.965 --> 30:46.067
they emit carbon dioxide.

30:46.267 --> 30:49.303
Then that has to have a circle again.

30:49.503 --> 30:52.667
So the leaves have to fall down into the ground

30:52.867 --> 30:57.900
because the nature must take nitrogen
from them, and must replace it back to them,

30:58.100 --> 31:03.567
to nourish them again, so they
can go into that cycle of movement.

31:03.767 --> 31:06.064
And from how it moves from one end to another.

31:06.264 --> 31:11.903
How carbon dioxide goes into the air
and how it is again reconverted back

31:12.103 --> 31:18.009
and how the whole thing is worked out in a
cycle is done. But they do not know all about it.

31:19.648 --> 31:26.908
They do it blindly. Absolutely blindly they are doing it,
because they are blind; because they don’t need to know.

31:27.109 --> 31:33.158
Like the small little babies and
puppies of the dog, if you see, they are blind;

31:33.358 --> 31:34.733
they don’t know how to go about.

31:34.933 --> 31:41.516
They just feel their mother and just go and start sucking the
breast and take feeding. You have seen them, very sweet ones!

31:41.716 --> 31:46.400
They can’t see anything. They just smell
something, they go down there and do it.

31:46.600 --> 31:51.567
So the mother looks after them at that time, and she
does everything that is needed even when they are blind.

31:51.767 --> 31:55.339
When you are also little children,
when this is not covered up, closed,

31:55.540 --> 31:58.900
your mother looks after you,
your father will look after you.

31:59.100 --> 32:02.698
They treat you just like a part of them all the time.

32:02.898 --> 32:06.558
All the time they are worried about
you. Not in modern times, of course.

32:06.758 --> 32:11.400
Modern times are one of the most
convoluted ones. But they used to do that way.

32:12.242 --> 32:16.730
But you are grown-up then they give you freedom to know

32:18.278 --> 32:20.400
that you are grown-up.

32:21.576 --> 32:29.067
And that is how God wants you to know that you
have evolved, you have received your Realisation.

32:29.267 --> 32:32.233
That you have become what you had to become.

32:32.433 --> 32:40.225
Because you have to now really re-manifest,

32:42.099 --> 32:46.400
God’s powers.

32:51.283 --> 32:54.733
This is the thing we have to understand.

32:54.933 --> 32:58.067
And then we should know what is our role in life,

32:58.267 --> 33:04.067
and what are we doing, where are we,
how are we placed, what is our position.

33:04.267 --> 33:07.285
This should give you the complete energy,

33:09.260 --> 33:11.900
to get to your Self, and work it out.

33:12.853 --> 33:14.773
May God bless you all.
