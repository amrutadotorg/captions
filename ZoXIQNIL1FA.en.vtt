00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:00.750
Welcome

1
00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:03.869
many people here who have not attended a programme of

2
00:00:04.599 --> 00:00:06.199
Shrimatatimaladevi.

3
00:00:08.739 --> 00:00:08.760
By

4
00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:10.569
good fortune.

5
00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:13.850
We are holding a seminar here this weekend.

6
00:00:14.819 --> 00:00:15.680
And

7
00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:17.500
we had the idea to

8
00:00:17.909 --> 00:00:19.620
open it out to a wider public.

9
00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.139
To share with you.

10
00:00:23.629 --> 00:00:24.250
The

11
00:00:24.379 --> 00:00:25.860
remarkable discovery.

12
00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:28.280
Which is Saharyoka.

13
00:00:40.209 --> 00:00:41.889
Shrimatadinimala Devi.

14
00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:47.240
is an absolutely unique figure in this world.

15
00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:50.650
And people have come from

16
00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:53.110
Many European countries

17
00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:53.930
to

18
00:00:57.159 --> 00:00:57.830
Join us

19
00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.909
this weekend.

20
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.260
I'm going to ask

21
00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:08.940
Gregoi de Calvermatin.

22
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:14.870
There's a Swiss

23
00:01:15.349 --> 00:01:15.980
national.

24
00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.019
Who has written a book on the subject.

25
00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:24.569
Off she marked his advent.

26
00:01:28.339 --> 00:01:29.870
To make a

27
00:01:30.599 --> 00:01:33.589
Presentation before Shimatai arrives

28
00:01:34.129 --> 00:01:36.290
to give you some orientation.

29
00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:41.260
Why it is

30
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.500
That

31
00:01:45.379 --> 00:01:46.839
This is such a unique

32
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.680
opportunity for all of us.

33
00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:51.089
At this juncture

34
00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:53.239
In our

35
00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:54.800
History

36
00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.000
In the national history,

37
00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.669
in the international history.

38
00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:03.940
In the very evolution of our species.

39
00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.229
You may hear some big words.

40
00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.979
This evening

41
00:02:14.779 --> 00:02:15.860
But I hope

42
00:02:17.029 --> 00:02:18.440
That you are people

43
00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:19.649
of a calibre.

44
00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:22.360
To seek

45
00:02:22.679 --> 00:02:23.360
the reality,

46
00:02:23.399 --> 00:02:24.190
the truth.

47
00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:25.949
In big words.

48
00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:29.949
And not to be

49
00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:31.130
satisfied

50
00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:32.559
with superficial

51
00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:34.199
answers

52
00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:36.360
to sublime questions.

53
00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:42.100
We have been having

54
00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:44.889
And intensely joyful.

55
00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:46.710
Seminar

56
00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:51.800
We want to share that joy with you.

57
00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.800
There is a very specific

58
00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.880
way

59
00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.929
by which

60
00:02:58.169 --> 00:03:00.429
that joy can be shared by everyone.

61
00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:02.529
It's the birthright of everyone.

62
00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:04.279
It's nothing

63
00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.179
Especially abnormal,

64
00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:11.940
everyone has the potential

65
00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.779
within them.

66
00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:14.850
To achieve

67
00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.270
what has been promised.

68
00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.820
And we have very much.

69
00:03:26.589 --> 00:03:27.190
That

70
00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:28.589
later on,

71
00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:31.330
You will make a point

72
00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.679
Of

73
00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.210
Finding out for yourself

74
00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:37.300
individually.

75
00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:41.979
How much potential you have.

76
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.389
To transform

77
00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:45.509
into the

78
00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:48.270
Promised state

79
00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:50.479
Which is very blissful.

80
00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:52.570
Very peaceful

81
00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:55.199
And very nourishing

82
00:03:58.419 --> 00:04:00.259
which we call self-realization.

83
00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:05.300
After the programme,

84
00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.740
those who are interested to do so.

85
00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:12.350
May like to leave their name and address with us in the

86
00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:14.289
Foyer

87
00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:18.298
So that we can be in touch with you about other programmes.

88
00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:24.618
programmes are held regularly in London and in many other cities in this country.

89
00:04:26.149 --> 00:04:29.500
And we look forward to meeting you and getting to know you.

90
00:04:30.829 --> 00:04:32.029
So without further

91
00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.700
I do.

92
00:04:34.859 --> 00:04:36.690
I'll ask Gregoire to speak to you

93
00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:38.250
and to introducerimai,

94
00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:39.970
who will be here in a few minutes.

95
00:04:40.299 --> 00:04:40.809
Thank you.

96
00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.829
OK

97
00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:05.380
Mhm

98
00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:07.049
All right.

99
00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:08.369
It's working.

100
00:05:08.579 --> 00:05:09.109
Um,

101
00:05:10.299 --> 00:05:11.019
again,

102
00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:12.440
good evening

103
00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:14.769
to everybody and most welcome.

104
00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:15.369
I mean,

105
00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:17.170
It's a very nice

106
00:05:17.339 --> 00:05:18.140
surroundings.

107
00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:19.010
We had a very

108
00:05:19.299 --> 00:05:20.339
jolly weekend here.

109
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.829
And we thank you for coming this evening.

110
00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.450
Now

111
00:05:27.899 --> 00:05:31.059
Introducing Saja yoga Oshimata is

112
00:05:32.149 --> 00:05:32.880
Always a

113
00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:35.230
Uh privilege,

114
00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:37.190
although it's not a very

115
00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:38.239
easy topic.

116
00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:41.790
The reason it is not

117
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.029
an easy topic is that the subject matter.

118
00:05:45.649 --> 00:05:45.660
I

119
00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:49.890
Slightly beyond the

120
00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:51.519
borders of our

121
00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:52.929
wildest dreams.

122
00:05:53.649 --> 00:05:54.940
And while presenting it,

123
00:05:55.019 --> 00:05:56.959
we have to be very careful not to look.

124
00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.049
Like

125
00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:03.000
Somebody who would be naive to the point of idiosity,

126
00:06:03.209 --> 00:06:04.010
is it an English word,

127
00:06:04.049 --> 00:06:04.739
idiosity?

128
00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:05.209
OK.

129
00:06:07.609 --> 00:06:10.170
Because what we are talking about is self-realization.

130
00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:14.010
If any of us know what self realisation is about,

131
00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:15.760
then we know it's a very big thing.

132
00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:19.549
It is something that

133
00:06:19.869 --> 00:06:25.750
very few saints and sages of the older days used to achieve

134
00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:30.700
after lives of tremendous labours and penances dedicated to that very purpose,

135
00:06:30.989 --> 00:06:32.489
which obviously is not

136
00:06:32.709 --> 00:06:35.519
the situation in which I am finding myself.

137
00:06:35.829 --> 00:06:37.910
I am an international civil servant,

138
00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:38.489
I have a wife,

139
00:06:38.549 --> 00:06:39.109
3 children,

140
00:06:39.149 --> 00:06:39.820
and so on,

141
00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:41.790
so that keeps me pretty busy.

142
00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:43.230
Uh

143
00:06:44.649 --> 00:06:45.010
So

144
00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:48.709
Self-realization while living in the world,

145
00:06:48.959 --> 00:06:49.510
this

146
00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:50.510
sounds like

147
00:06:50.839 --> 00:06:51.600
utopia.

148
00:06:52.709 --> 00:06:55.799
I have methimatajee about 10 years ago,

149
00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:56.559
um,

150
00:06:57.049 --> 00:06:57.779
slightly,

151
00:06:58.369 --> 00:06:58.859
slightly more,

152
00:06:58.929 --> 00:06:59.329
I suppose,

153
00:06:59.369 --> 00:06:59.670
now.

154
00:07:00.049 --> 00:07:00.519
And

155
00:07:01.709 --> 00:07:03.850
That is enough for me to know it's not utopia,

156
00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:04.959
it's reality.

157
00:07:05.269 --> 00:07:05.510
Now,

158
00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:09.440
I have no pretension to communicate this very truth to you.

159
00:07:11.179 --> 00:07:12.959
Because if I have accepted it,

160
00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:17.390
it is on the basis of my own experience and not because anybody would tell me so.

161
00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:17.760
Actually,

162
00:07:17.799 --> 00:07:19.109
the people who told me so,

163
00:07:19.279 --> 00:07:21.000
I told them that they were.

164
00:07:21.899 --> 00:07:22.559
You know,

165
00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:23.679
killing themselves.

166
00:07:24.369 --> 00:07:26.959
And I would expect from you the same kind of healthy

167
00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:28.040
scepticism.

168
00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:30.399
I,

169
00:07:30.549 --> 00:07:31.510
you shouldn't believe me,

170
00:07:31.529 --> 00:07:32.070
of course.

171
00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:37.149
Somebody who believes people in this world today

172
00:07:37.149 --> 00:07:39.500
is somebody who is in for troubles because

173
00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:42.269
especially in the field of spirituality.

174
00:07:42.899 --> 00:07:45.989
You have all kind of crazy show going on in town.

175
00:07:47.029 --> 00:07:47.709
Unfortunately,

176
00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:49.589
these shows are sometimes very successful.

177
00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:52.880
So that for someone who is genuine but confused,

178
00:07:52.959 --> 00:07:55.869
which seems to be the characteristic of many seekers.

179
00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:57.769
Certainly,

180
00:07:58.059 --> 00:07:58.290
I mean,

181
00:07:58.380 --> 00:07:58.850
I would.

182
00:07:59.579 --> 00:08:00.209
Certainly

183
00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:02.730
Describe myself as being confused.

184
00:08:04.209 --> 00:08:04.679
When

185
00:08:05.209 --> 00:08:08.250
I think about the state I was before I met Shrima Taju.

186
00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:13.609
It's very difficult to know who is genuine and who is not,

187
00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:16.049
who delivers the goods and who doesn't,

188
00:08:16.059 --> 00:08:17.059
and who is just

189
00:08:17.299 --> 00:08:18.579
a kind of illusion.

190
00:08:19.649 --> 00:08:20.250
Makers

191
00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:22.760
So

192
00:08:25.119 --> 00:08:25.720
The

193
00:08:26.119 --> 00:08:27.549
way to go about this

194
00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:30.260
riddle is just to submit to you that

195
00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:35.030
whatever may be said on Saja yoga isn't for you and hypothesis.

196
00:08:35.739 --> 00:08:38.919
And this is probably what Shi mother she will tell you also in a few minutes

197
00:08:39.448 --> 00:08:39.729
now.

198
00:08:40.969 --> 00:08:42.359
You know that for

199
00:08:43.119 --> 00:08:44.260
And hypothesis

200
00:08:44.869 --> 00:08:45.239
to

201
00:08:47.419 --> 00:08:48.729
Considered as a law,

202
00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:50.169
it has to fulfil

203
00:08:50.419 --> 00:08:51.419
two requirements.

204
00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:54.429
It has to be communicable and verifiable under

205
00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:56.280
certain conditions.

206
00:08:56.659 --> 00:08:57.000
So

207
00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:00.669
The hypothesis of Sajo yoga which is going to be laid

208
00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:04.179
down or presented for you is going to be verified

209
00:09:04.549 --> 00:09:05.840
for those who so desire,

210
00:09:05.989 --> 00:09:06.799
not for the others,

211
00:09:06.869 --> 00:09:07.539
of course,

212
00:09:08.109 --> 00:09:12.049
by a session of meditation at the end of the programme of Shrimataji

213
00:09:12.309 --> 00:09:16.179
in which Srimataji will again show an absolutely

214
00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:18.099
amazing capacity.

215
00:09:19.969 --> 00:09:19.979
To

216
00:09:20.799 --> 00:09:24.890
play this catalytical role in granting people their self-realization.

217
00:09:25.619 --> 00:09:27.750
So if you came here to listen to a lecture,

218
00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:30.630
You're like someone who

219
00:09:33.919 --> 00:09:35.830
came and thought he had $5.

220
00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:37.479
In his pockets,

221
00:09:37.559 --> 00:09:39.630
but it's not $5 it's $5000

222
00:09:40.119 --> 00:09:40.510
because

223
00:09:41.159 --> 00:09:42.799
really what you can get this.

224
00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:46.440
Evening is much more than analytical knowledge

225
00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:49.039
which is communicated by means of words.

226
00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:50.760
So,

227
00:09:50.969 --> 00:09:54.330
this is a kind of introduction to the hypothesis.

228
00:09:56.619 --> 00:09:57.479
And uh

229
00:10:00.609 --> 00:10:01.590
I assure you

230
00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:04.700
That the only thing it takes to

231
00:10:08.239 --> 00:10:11.150
Verify what is actually going on

232
00:10:11.599 --> 00:10:12.049
is

233
00:10:13.809 --> 00:10:15.789
A certain intellectual honesty,

234
00:10:15.979 --> 00:10:16.669
that's all.

235
00:10:17.109 --> 00:10:17.599
A certain

236
00:10:17.719 --> 00:10:18.400
genuineness.

237
00:10:20.799 --> 00:10:22.179
And of course the desire

238
00:10:22.789 --> 00:10:24.039
to know what's going on,

239
00:10:24.669 --> 00:10:25.789
not about saja yoga,

240
00:10:25.799 --> 00:10:26.150
of course,

241
00:10:26.239 --> 00:10:28.330
but what's going on about our own life,

242
00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:29.830
about the way to fulfil it.

243
00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:33.109
Now,

244
00:10:33.369 --> 00:10:35.219
the hypothesis is very simple.

245
00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:37.349
This is the framework

246
00:10:37.539 --> 00:10:38.460
of the hypothesis.

247
00:10:39.359 --> 00:10:39.890
And

248
00:10:41.849 --> 00:10:43.369
What we say is this.

249
00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:51.270
You have the sacrum bone which is more or less at the bottom of your spine,

250
00:10:51.799 --> 00:10:53.109
and energy which is

251
00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:55.719
Could be called in our tradition as

252
00:10:56.059 --> 00:10:56.539
the

253
00:10:56.799 --> 00:10:58.150
residual consciousness,

254
00:10:58.460 --> 00:10:59.539
consciousness of the

255
00:10:59.859 --> 00:11:00.849
Holy Spirit

256
00:11:01.419 --> 00:11:01.969
in

257
00:11:02.299 --> 00:11:02.780
man.

258
00:11:04.739 --> 00:11:06.619
This energy is called kundalini

259
00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:07.530
in Sanskrit.

260
00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:09.919
Now,

261
00:11:10.179 --> 00:11:12.909
what we call self-realization.

262
00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:14.580
I

263
00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:17.229
That has to be defined

264
00:11:17.479 --> 00:11:17.989
is

265
00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:19.789
the following process,

266
00:11:20.109 --> 00:11:21.760
the process of this energy.

267
00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:23.359
Going up

268
00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:24.760
within the spine.

269
00:11:25.799 --> 00:11:31.549
Crossing this famous point known as the Third Eye in various esoteric traditions.

270
00:11:32.770 --> 00:11:34.179
Going through this

271
00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:37.349
beautiful flower here which

272
00:11:38.729 --> 00:11:40.799
Lord Buddha described

273
00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:42.200
as the

274
00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:45.159
1000 petalled lots

275
00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:45.840
and

276
00:11:46.799 --> 00:11:48.150
oozing out of

277
00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:50.159
the top of the skull.

278
00:11:51.169 --> 00:11:51.979
Now

279
00:11:52.229 --> 00:11:54.299
when this takes place,

280
00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:54.890
what,

281
00:11:55.070 --> 00:11:55.739
what does it mean?

282
00:11:55.830 --> 00:11:57.109
What are the implications?

283
00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:04.020
I think Shri Mata is already coming.

284
00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:15.229
What are the implications of this process?

285
00:12:17.969 --> 00:12:19.000
First of all,

286
00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:20.929
you can register the process.

287
00:12:22.929 --> 00:12:23.289
In

288
00:12:23.809 --> 00:12:24.570
I would say

289
00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:26.250
essentially two ways.

290
00:12:29.099 --> 00:12:30.609
When the energy

291
00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:31.729
crosses.

292
00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:33.960
This centre,

293
00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:34.919
the Agya chakra.

294
00:12:35.859 --> 00:12:37.539
One enters into a state.

295
00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:40.559
which is a state of silence.

296
00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:44.530
And we all know we'd rather think a lot and it's

297
00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:47.520
not easy to stop thinking even if we do so.

298
00:12:47.650 --> 00:12:49.570
I mean if we wish to do so.

299
00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:53.169
This state of silence.

300
00:12:55.099 --> 00:12:56.270
Announces

301
00:12:57.570 --> 00:12:59.010
The quality of

302
00:12:59.359 --> 00:13:02.270
what Lord Jesus Christ has described as the kingdom of God,

303
00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:06.309
because when one can penetrate farther into this silence.

304
00:13:07.669 --> 00:13:08.260
One

305
00:13:08.549 --> 00:13:09.500
undoubtedly.

306
00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:11.609
Discover

307
00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:14.409
A new quality of

308
00:13:14.729 --> 00:13:15.280
being,

309
00:13:15.359 --> 00:13:17.289
and I would like to come back on this

310
00:13:17.729 --> 00:13:18.080
now.

311
00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:23.169
On the kundalini is just a couple of centimetres upwards and oozes out of the head.

312
00:13:24.969 --> 00:13:25.400
Then

313
00:13:25.530 --> 00:13:26.229
what happens?

314
00:13:27.979 --> 00:13:28.770
There again,

315
00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:29.859
what happens

316
00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:31.619
has been referred to in

317
00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:32.570
very

318
00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:33.900
ancient texts.

319
00:13:35.489 --> 00:13:37.590
What actually happens is

320
00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:39.000
one feel

321
00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:42.700
The manifestation of something.

322
00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:44.429
Which is

323
00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:47.039
A cool breeze

324
00:13:47.919 --> 00:13:49.419
And this is the cool breeze.

325
00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:51.500
Which

326
00:13:52.070 --> 00:13:54.719
was called asnoima or nose by the

327
00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:57.380
Greek fathers of the church.

328
00:14:00.669 --> 00:14:02.229
It was referred to

329
00:14:02.489 --> 00:14:03.700
also in the Bible.

330
00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:06.299
As

331
00:14:07.479 --> 00:14:10.190
This mighty wind which erupted in the house.

332
00:14:12.159 --> 00:14:15.260
Where the apostles were gathered for Pentecost.

333
00:14:16.799 --> 00:14:20.659
There are many references in various cultures to this phenomenon

334
00:14:21.229 --> 00:14:22.789
that we call vibrations.

335
00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:27.450
What actually happens is that our central nervous system,

336
00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:31.119
which means this physical system by which we feel sensations,

337
00:14:31.650 --> 00:14:35.960
become aware of a subtle energy which was always existing before

338
00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:36.840
but

339
00:14:37.010 --> 00:14:38.080
which we could not

340
00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:39.080
perceive.

341
00:14:39.289 --> 00:14:40.260
It's like you have,

342
00:14:40.409 --> 00:14:42.679
let's say a radio here.

343
00:14:42.890 --> 00:14:43.070
I mean,

344
00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:44.799
if the radio is not switched on,

345
00:14:44.969 --> 00:14:46.840
it cannot pick up all the waves

346
00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:51.039
and the music which is in the room in the same way self realisation

347
00:14:51.409 --> 00:14:53.210
allows our central nervous system.

348
00:14:53.789 --> 00:14:57.820
To pick on those waves to feel these vibrations

349
00:14:58.340 --> 00:14:59.780
which are a spiritual energy.

350
00:14:59.859 --> 00:15:00.859
In other words,

351
00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:01.690
this is

352
00:15:01.979 --> 00:15:02.489
the

353
00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:03.690
meeting

354
00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:06.210
point of matter and spirit

355
00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:08.369
because with the material structure

356
00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:10.489
one becomes aware

357
00:15:10.859 --> 00:15:11.530
of

358
00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:12.969
spirit,

359
00:15:13.179 --> 00:15:15.059
and this is a breakthrough

360
00:15:15.419 --> 00:15:15.979
into.

361
00:15:17.039 --> 00:15:18.539
The 4th dimension,

362
00:15:18.909 --> 00:15:20.260
these vibrations

363
00:15:20.549 --> 00:15:23.520
are the category of perception that Kant

364
00:15:24.070 --> 00:15:24.669
was.

365
00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:29.349
Requiring in order to know the things in themselves.

366
00:15:30.210 --> 00:15:32.409
In order to know reality.

367
00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:36.890
And it is because at that time he said that we don't have

368
00:15:36.890 --> 00:15:42.250
this new or this other category of perception to know metaphysical realities,

369
00:15:42.369 --> 00:15:43.059
metaphysics,

370
00:15:43.090 --> 00:15:44.690
that is what is beyond physics.

371
00:15:45.630 --> 00:15:49.090
That is why we should just limit ourselves to rationality,

372
00:15:49.099 --> 00:15:50.840
and from there on the whole

373
00:15:52.010 --> 00:15:52.530
the march,

374
00:15:52.570 --> 00:15:54.840
the whole direction of the Western seekers

375
00:15:55.159 --> 00:15:56.090
went into.

376
00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:57.669
Basically,

377
00:15:57.929 --> 00:16:00.159
this finite world and no more,

378
00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:04.109
this world which was keeping people like Plato and Socrates busy,

379
00:16:04.309 --> 00:16:05.469
the world of

380
00:16:05.679 --> 00:16:06.619
the things in themselves,

381
00:16:06.679 --> 00:16:07.440
of reality.

382
00:16:08.919 --> 00:16:10.739
Now this is important to know because

383
00:16:10.989 --> 00:16:15.590
this breakthrough in our category of perception has been sought by so many seekers.

384
00:16:16.309 --> 00:16:17.969
That people who know that background,

385
00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:20.010
would it be only intellectually know

386
00:16:20.539 --> 00:16:20.929
that.

387
00:16:22.409 --> 00:16:23.880
One thing has to happen.

388
00:16:24.599 --> 00:16:28.669
In order to know reality is that we have to have a new means.

389
00:16:29.690 --> 00:16:34.469
And this is how you'll better understand the importance of these vibrations

390
00:16:34.719 --> 00:16:36.719
and the importance of what can be done with them.

391
00:16:37.669 --> 00:16:38.590
This is such

392
00:16:38.789 --> 00:16:41.299
a rich and vast topic

393
00:16:41.669 --> 00:16:42.460
that I

394
00:16:42.669 --> 00:16:44.700
simply would not like to enter into it now.

395
00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:45.450
Now,

396
00:16:45.469 --> 00:16:48.549
going back to what I said a few minutes ago.

397
00:16:49.479 --> 00:16:53.479
This quality of silence one discovers at the level of the Agya chakra.

398
00:16:56.020 --> 00:17:00.530
Is the space of reality between two thought movements.

399
00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:03.849
Now the action of this energy which we have called kundalini.

400
00:17:04.810 --> 00:17:07.000
Pushes the thoughts on the side.

401
00:17:07.618 --> 00:17:09.329
And then you enter in your own.

402
00:17:10.410 --> 00:17:11.219
Realm

403
00:17:13.368 --> 00:17:14.798
What actually happened is this,

404
00:17:14.808 --> 00:17:15.398
is that

405
00:17:15.808 --> 00:17:18.598
once the kundalini is at the top of the head.

406
00:17:19.810 --> 00:17:22.229
There is a secret link

407
00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:25.199
between a secret link between the head and the heart.

408
00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:29.319
And the heart is the seat of the self,

409
00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:30.530
the spirit,

410
00:17:30.859 --> 00:17:31.790
the atma

411
00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:32.849
in Sanskrit.

412
00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:39.239
So through this link in your consciousness in your brain,

413
00:17:39.989 --> 00:17:43.689
You start imbibing Ama consciousness.

414
00:17:43.819 --> 00:17:46.469
That means you start being aware,

415
00:17:46.619 --> 00:17:51.510
conscious of those qualities which are the qualities of the self,

416
00:17:51.739 --> 00:17:53.939
which are called sat

417
00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:55.650
chit ananda

418
00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:56.869
meaning

419
00:17:57.219 --> 00:17:57.660
truth.

420
00:17:58.380 --> 00:17:59.459
Consciousness

421
00:18:00.010 --> 00:18:00.829
And bliss

422
00:18:05.619 --> 00:18:07.650
So this is the hypothesis.

423
00:18:10.319 --> 00:18:12.670
As shortly as I could.

424
00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:21.810
This is true.

425
00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:41.130
He's gonna go ahead.

426
00:18:44.530 --> 00:18:45.000
So

427
00:18:58.540 --> 00:18:59.689
The same reading as ours,

428
00:18:59.729 --> 00:18:59.890
I.

429
00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:04.469
Now

430
00:19:05.459 --> 00:19:06.329
As I

431
00:19:06.599 --> 00:19:07.160
mentioned,

432
00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:13.979
The very reassuring thing about Saja yoga is is that

433
00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:18.949
nobody is ever told to believe in anything that is not.

434
00:19:19.979 --> 00:19:22.180
Object of experience and perception.

435
00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:28.829
I also mention

436
00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:30.739
that for those who so desire.

437
00:19:31.569 --> 00:19:33.310
The verification of the

438
00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:35.930
hypothesis can take place at the end of this.

439
00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:38.180
programme.

440
00:19:38.219 --> 00:19:42.500
Now I should perhaps before ending tell you why it is so.

441
00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:48.479
Why it is that we who are very

442
00:19:50.010 --> 00:19:51.949
I should say normal people.

443
00:19:52.869 --> 00:19:56.890
Why is it that we should be in a position to know this experience?

444
00:19:57.839 --> 00:19:59.729
What have we done to deserve it?

445
00:19:59.930 --> 00:20:00.109
I mean,

446
00:20:00.130 --> 00:20:01.439
if I ask this question.

447
00:20:02.209 --> 00:20:03.079
For myself,

448
00:20:03.170 --> 00:20:04.839
I'm a bit puzzled because

449
00:20:05.170 --> 00:20:05.719
I

450
00:20:06.130 --> 00:20:06.770
certainly

451
00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:09.010
I did not at any point ever

452
00:20:09.619 --> 00:20:10.969
got the feeling that I

453
00:20:11.339 --> 00:20:11.810
had

454
00:20:12.099 --> 00:20:13.780
done anything to deserve that.

455
00:20:16.099 --> 00:20:17.099
So it came

456
00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:21.849
As such a surprise to me that I should get my realisation that really

457
00:20:21.849 --> 00:20:24.969
for quite some time I would not quite believe that it is so.

458
00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.589
And I found out later on that many

459
00:20:27.589 --> 00:20:30.469
people have the same difficulty to relate to something

460
00:20:30.469 --> 00:20:35.150
which is so incredibly beyond our wildest dream that it's just too good to be true.

461
00:20:36.010 --> 00:20:37.089
In no way is the catch?

462
00:20:37.119 --> 00:20:37.229
I mean,

463
00:20:37.239 --> 00:20:38.589
it's not possible.

464
00:20:38.839 --> 00:20:39.000
Well,

465
00:20:39.079 --> 00:20:39.560
it is.

466
00:20:40.189 --> 00:20:43.339
And Shimaoji is as a very which I

467
00:20:43.630 --> 00:20:44.339
welcome here.

468
00:20:44.569 --> 00:20:46.500
It's very gracious of you to have come,

469
00:20:46.510 --> 00:20:46.750
and

470
00:20:47.229 --> 00:20:48.619
we thank you so much.

471
00:20:48.949 --> 00:20:49.630
We certainly

472
00:20:50.189 --> 00:20:51.520
are very grateful to you for coming,

473
00:20:51.589 --> 00:20:51.979
Shimata.

474
00:20:52.930 --> 00:20:53.280
Um,

475
00:20:56.119 --> 00:20:57.869
Shimataji is a very poetical,

476
00:20:58.119 --> 00:21:01.599
simple image which in my view is perfect because it

477
00:21:01.599 --> 00:21:04.589
carries the strength of simplicity and it says it all.

478
00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:06.150
Shimatoji says that

479
00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:06.719
well,

480
00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:09.640
if you have a tree which starts producing flowers

481
00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:12.109
in the middle of winter under snow and storm,

482
00:21:12.239 --> 00:21:13.319
this is a miracle.

483
00:21:14.839 --> 00:21:16.849
And that miracle where

484
00:21:17.930 --> 00:21:22.410
Those great souls of the past which received their realisation at a

485
00:21:22.410 --> 00:21:27.599
point where the whole evolutionary process was not quite mature for this.

486
00:21:27.810 --> 00:21:28.170
Therefore,

487
00:21:28.209 --> 00:21:30.160
that will struggle in an incredible way,

488
00:21:30.329 --> 00:21:35.770
and this is what you learn when you study the lives of such great people.

489
00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:37.859
Now

490
00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:41.670
If this same tree is blossoming in spring,

491
00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:42.709
it's not a miracle.

492
00:21:42.869 --> 00:21:43.430
It's,

493
00:21:43.670 --> 00:21:44.670
it's nature's,

494
00:21:44.829 --> 00:21:47.060
it's nature's ways and

495
00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:47.979
rhythm.

496
00:21:48.069 --> 00:21:49.540
It is the

497
00:21:49.790 --> 00:21:51.260
dance of evolution.

498
00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:53.500
It is the moment that that should happen.

499
00:21:53.829 --> 00:21:59.540
And so Shrimata she says we now have entered a time where this process

500
00:21:59.910 --> 00:22:03.829
of triggering our mass centralization has come.

501
00:22:05.369 --> 00:22:07.369
And if you study art,

502
00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:08.469
literature,

503
00:22:09.079 --> 00:22:09.239
anything,

504
00:22:09.319 --> 00:22:11.390
any parameter of modern civilization,

505
00:22:11.479 --> 00:22:13.750
you know that there is a tremendous expectation

506
00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:15.319
for this kind of breakthrough.

507
00:22:16.319 --> 00:22:18.540
And this is pretty obvious that

508
00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:19.540
today

509
00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:20.380
Englishmen,

510
00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:21.380
for instance,

511
00:22:21.589 --> 00:22:23.189
are not motivated by many things,

512
00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:25.540
certainly not by competing with

513
00:22:25.869 --> 00:22:27.630
Japanese in order to make gadgets.

514
00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:28.219
I mean,

515
00:22:28.270 --> 00:22:31.099
the economic indicators prove that

516
00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:33.859
they don't devote much energy to these things.

517
00:22:34.229 --> 00:22:34.640
So,

518
00:22:35.219 --> 00:22:35.229
uh,

519
00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:35.859
what,

520
00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:36.750
what,

521
00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:38.670
what do they care about?

522
00:22:39.609 --> 00:22:40.209
Uh,

523
00:22:40.729 --> 00:22:41.599
cricket maybe,

524
00:22:41.609 --> 00:22:42.050
but

525
00:22:42.569 --> 00:22:43.689
other things too,

526
00:22:44.089 --> 00:22:44.640
and

527
00:22:45.290 --> 00:22:45.969
actually,

528
00:22:46.849 --> 00:22:51.239
I would submit that it is probably an evolutionary progress to accept

529
00:22:51.239 --> 00:22:54.430
that GNP should decrease because one does not bother about it,

530
00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:55.170
but then

531
00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:57.920
what should we devote our attention to?

532
00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.989
And many people in this country,

533
00:23:00.199 --> 00:23:00.949
as in any

534
00:23:01.579 --> 00:23:03.479
So-called industrial countries

535
00:23:03.849 --> 00:23:07.010
are trying to devote more energy to the pursuit of this inner truth.

536
00:23:07.959 --> 00:23:09.579
The only trouble is

537
00:23:10.369 --> 00:23:14.709
The setup that I've described before is that there is such a big show in town

538
00:23:14.959 --> 00:23:15.680
that people

539
00:23:16.910 --> 00:23:18.880
Don't go into the right shop

540
00:23:19.349 --> 00:23:19.829
because first of all,

541
00:23:19.910 --> 00:23:21.829
they assume it has to be found in a shop.

542
00:23:22.949 --> 00:23:24.140
Where you can buy it,

543
00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:25.939
and this is the first mistake.

544
00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:28.489
So

545
00:23:31.979 --> 00:23:33.459
Here you can't buy

546
00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:34.959
because it's too expensive.

547
00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:38.890
It's so expensive that it can only be given.

548
00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:44.290
She says a realisation is as important as breathing

549
00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:45.660
if you would have to.

550
00:23:46.489 --> 00:23:48.229
Puncture your bank account

551
00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:49.510
in order to have the right to breathe,

552
00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:51.069
you would be dead a long time back.

553
00:23:51.959 --> 00:23:53.630
And it is the same thing.

554
00:23:56.839 --> 00:23:57.599
So

555
00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:02.510
it happens now because now the time has come and it happens for another reason,

556
00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:04.280
and this other reason.

557
00:24:05.010 --> 00:24:06.829
If I may say so he is sitting before you.

558
00:24:09.719 --> 00:24:10.069
Now

559
00:24:15.739 --> 00:24:17.010
Speaking to,

560
00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:19.569
I would say a few people who have

561
00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:22.010
never had exposure to Saaja yoga,

562
00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:26.109
I should certainly keep a kind of sobriety while introducing Srimatai,

563
00:24:26.219 --> 00:24:27.089
which is difficult

564
00:24:27.939 --> 00:24:28.290
because

565
00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:30.300
our achievement I saw.

566
00:24:31.050 --> 00:24:32.280
Extraordinary

567
00:24:33.589 --> 00:24:34.189
That

568
00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:36.319
they are difficult to express in English,

569
00:24:36.359 --> 00:24:37.510
which is a language

570
00:24:38.239 --> 00:24:39.760
appreciating understatements.

571
00:24:43.109 --> 00:24:44.939
It's very difficult to understate

572
00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:45.869
rimataje.

573
00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:46.890
I mean,

574
00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:49.020
we are condemned to understate her anyway.

575
00:24:49.739 --> 00:24:51.380
But how to

576
00:24:51.719 --> 00:24:52.310
give

577
00:24:52.599 --> 00:24:54.910
some or render some justice to

578
00:24:55.239 --> 00:24:55.910
her labour.

579
00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:58.339
The work she has been doing

580
00:24:58.869 --> 00:25:02.449
in this country and I should say in the whole of Western Europe,

581
00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:04.709
not to mention Australia and of course India.

582
00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:11.410
What I know is that she's a totally selfless,

583
00:25:11.739 --> 00:25:13.209
totally genuine person.

584
00:25:13.939 --> 00:25:16.489
Not only she didn't ever take any.

585
00:25:17.209 --> 00:25:21.280
Penny I should blush for saying such a nonsense from anybody,

586
00:25:21.890 --> 00:25:22.359
but

587
00:25:23.150 --> 00:25:25.540
The first lot of her followers in London were

588
00:25:25.810 --> 00:25:26.599
of such

589
00:25:27.209 --> 00:25:30.530
a kind of economically derelict so that she had to

590
00:25:30.530 --> 00:25:32.530
pay for the rent of the flat for some time.

591
00:25:33.729 --> 00:25:36.650
So this is one of the oddities of Saja yoga and

592
00:25:36.650 --> 00:25:39.729
there are many others that you will discover in due time.

593
00:25:40.739 --> 00:25:41.660
Srimatai

594
00:25:43.150 --> 00:25:45.459
Despite a tremendous power

595
00:25:46.069 --> 00:25:46.939
that

596
00:25:47.189 --> 00:25:50.989
we would not be able to face if that power would not be just.

597
00:25:52.239 --> 00:25:52.900
Love

598
00:25:54.079 --> 00:25:54.969
Despite

599
00:25:55.930 --> 00:25:57.219
Cities despite

600
00:25:57.449 --> 00:25:58.599
qualities that

601
00:25:59.209 --> 00:26:00.479
in my humble view,

602
00:26:00.770 --> 00:26:02.839
are to be found in nobody on this earth,

603
00:26:02.930 --> 00:26:04.160
and I've seen a lot of

604
00:26:04.449 --> 00:26:06.339
so-called spiritual people before I met Shri Matai.

605
00:26:06.810 --> 00:26:07.760
Despite all this,

606
00:26:08.290 --> 00:26:09.709
she's extremely

607
00:26:12.439 --> 00:26:12.949
Human

608
00:26:13.869 --> 00:26:14.439
I mean,

609
00:26:14.609 --> 00:26:15.339
much more than me.

610
00:26:15.420 --> 00:26:15.880
I'm

611
00:26:16.329 --> 00:26:17.329
quite surprised about that.

612
00:26:24.010 --> 00:26:24.319
This,

613
00:26:24.369 --> 00:26:25.550
there is a word in,

614
00:26:25.599 --> 00:26:27.010
in Sanskrit for this.

615
00:26:27.839 --> 00:26:30.670
And this word is called mahamaya,

616
00:26:30.989 --> 00:26:33.790
and Mahamaya means the great illusion.

617
00:26:34.869 --> 00:26:38.260
So you have the privilege to sit this evening in front of

618
00:26:39.339 --> 00:26:39.869
A very,

619
00:26:39.930 --> 00:26:40.949
very great illusion,

620
00:26:41.130 --> 00:26:43.650
and this is the illusion that you are in front of a human being.

621
00:26:48.410 --> 00:26:50.229
It's a nice illusion though,

622
00:26:50.599 --> 00:26:53.430
because if you would realise that it is not so,

623
00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:54.449
you may run away,

624
00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:56.079
and this is not the purpose of the evening.

625
00:27:07.989 --> 00:27:10.449
So I suppose that I

626
00:27:10.859 --> 00:27:11.650
should end this

627
00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:14.099
few words by means of introduction.

628
00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:17.430
Thanking you very much for having.

629
00:27:19.530 --> 00:27:21.609
Come all the way from wherever you came.

630
00:27:22.579 --> 00:27:23.500
And

631
00:27:24.849 --> 00:27:26.089
If Saja yoga.

632
00:27:29.589 --> 00:27:30.569
It's full of joy.

633
00:27:30.579 --> 00:27:31.300
It's full of humour.

634
00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:32.979
It's also a sacred reality.

635
00:27:34.099 --> 00:27:38.430
It is the sacred reality of our innermost divine divine

636
00:27:38.849 --> 00:27:39.290
being.

637
00:27:42.619 --> 00:27:48.000
Which opens itself if we in all humility and sincerity so wish

638
00:27:48.369 --> 00:27:49.089
Shimatai.

639
00:27:50.060 --> 00:27:50.829
I am

640
00:27:51.359 --> 00:27:51.790
again.

641
00:27:53.569 --> 00:27:57.229
In the name of everybody most graceful that you should grace this evening.

642
00:27:58.180 --> 00:27:59.609
And it is my

643
00:27:59.770 --> 00:28:03.000
humblest prayer that everybody who has come should

644
00:28:03.689 --> 00:28:06.260
experience their self-realization and what is even.

645
00:28:06.949 --> 00:28:11.130
I should say what is even as important as that should understand what great,

646
00:28:11.569 --> 00:28:12.150
great.

647
00:28:13.479 --> 00:28:14.030
Gift

648
00:28:15.349 --> 00:28:16.260
That evening

649
00:28:18.890 --> 00:28:19.520
I

650
00:28:21.170 --> 00:28:21.890
For them.

651
00:28:22.329 --> 00:28:23.109
Thank you very much.

652
00:28:30.270 --> 00:28:31.079
We do flowers.

653
00:28:33.699 --> 00:28:33.939
Oh.

654
00:28:35.589 --> 00:28:35.599
Ah

655
00:28:38.829 --> 00:28:39.030
It's

656
00:29:11.329 --> 00:29:14.189
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

657
00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:30.119
We had no intentions of having any public programmes

658
00:29:30.369 --> 00:29:31.160
in England.

659
00:29:31.979 --> 00:29:33.050
But somehow

660
00:29:34.020 --> 00:29:34.199
Mr.

661
00:29:34.369 --> 00:29:35.219
Gavin Brown.

662
00:29:36.359 --> 00:29:38.119
Hopes against hopes.

663
00:29:41.270 --> 00:29:43.369
And they spent a lot of money.

664
00:29:44.650 --> 00:29:45.800
For this programme.

665
00:29:48.189 --> 00:29:50.140
And I only feel sorry that

666
00:29:50.959 --> 00:29:51.869
Every time

667
00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:53.989
they have a public programme,

668
00:29:54.199 --> 00:29:55.719
we get very few people.

669
00:29:56.819 --> 00:29:58.119
And even if you get

670
00:29:58.359 --> 00:30:01.050
last time we had about 300 people who were new.

671
00:30:02.540 --> 00:30:05.530
They got some of them did touch realisation.

672
00:30:06.609 --> 00:30:08.030
They looked very serious.

673
00:30:09.239 --> 00:30:11.040
But nothing inside.

674
00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:13.310
We lost most of them.

675
00:30:14.770 --> 00:30:15.579
Because

676
00:30:16.750 --> 00:30:16.989
See,

677
00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:20.189
we have become used to our mental

678
00:30:20.510 --> 00:30:21.619
capacity

679
00:30:22.010 --> 00:30:23.670
to enact something.

680
00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:27.119
And not to be the reality.

681
00:30:28.089 --> 00:30:30.430
It's a specialty of mental people.

682
00:30:31.130 --> 00:30:33.140
That they talk too much.

683
00:30:33.439 --> 00:30:34.510
They say too much.

684
00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:36.540
Have nothing with them.

685
00:30:37.890 --> 00:30:40.270
It's very shocking sometimes when you see.

686
00:30:41.939 --> 00:30:42.489
How

687
00:30:44.010 --> 00:30:45.800
People say things.

688
00:30:46.989 --> 00:30:48.160
About reality

689
00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:50.750
I watch sometimes television.

690
00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:52.790
I see people

691
00:30:52.959 --> 00:30:53.930
on the television.

692
00:30:55.239 --> 00:30:57.760
And I feel they are somewhere near reality.

693
00:30:57.869 --> 00:30:59.579
They are talking about reality.

694
00:31:00.310 --> 00:31:01.680
They understand that

695
00:31:01.989 --> 00:31:03.869
there's something missing in their lives.

696
00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:06.390
And they are looking for it.

697
00:31:08.630 --> 00:31:10.790
But when it comes to actualization.

698
00:31:13.050 --> 00:31:13.949
And to

699
00:31:14.079 --> 00:31:16.030
achieving what you have,

700
00:31:16.359 --> 00:31:17.949
whatever is your own,

701
00:31:18.319 --> 00:31:20.150
they become absolutely.

702
00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:22.219
Mundane,

703
00:31:22.459 --> 00:31:23.140
frivolous.

704
00:31:23.910 --> 00:31:24.979
Very surprising

705
00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:28.229
I can't understand why it should happen.

706
00:31:29.329 --> 00:31:30.719
Now supposing you say.

707
00:31:31.550 --> 00:31:32.739
As Gregar has been.

708
00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:34.729
Give me certificates,

709
00:31:34.819 --> 00:31:36.359
late certificates he was given.

710
00:31:37.369 --> 00:31:38.520
And also

711
00:31:38.819 --> 00:31:39.900
he he's a diplomat,

712
00:31:40.020 --> 00:31:42.729
so diplomatically he was trying to please all of you

713
00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:44.780
so that you take to Sergioga.

714
00:31:46.069 --> 00:31:47.869
Because he doesn't want you to commit the

715
00:31:47.869 --> 00:31:50.109
same mistakes that most of them have committed.

716
00:31:52.670 --> 00:31:53.369
But

717
00:31:53.609 --> 00:31:54.449
despite all that,

718
00:31:56.150 --> 00:31:58.670
Let us face ourselves clearly.

719
00:32:01.250 --> 00:32:02.310
Newcomers are

720
00:32:03.410 --> 00:32:04.869
Absolutely a minority here,

721
00:32:04.969 --> 00:32:06.969
so I'm talking also to Sergio.

722
00:32:08.170 --> 00:32:10.239
Let us face ourselves

723
00:32:10.530 --> 00:32:11.010
fully.

724
00:32:13.949 --> 00:32:15.160
Are we ourselves?

725
00:32:17.270 --> 00:32:20.229
We've got everything supposing we say right,

726
00:32:20.489 --> 00:32:22.160
we have seen the power

727
00:32:22.729 --> 00:32:24.540
of political achievement,

728
00:32:24.930 --> 00:32:26.670
of economic achievements,

729
00:32:27.209 --> 00:32:31.010
of other achievements which we call emotional achievements.

730
00:32:32.170 --> 00:32:33.660
But have we really

731
00:32:34.270 --> 00:32:35.569
faced ourselves?

732
00:32:35.829 --> 00:32:36.910
Have we seen ourselves?

733
00:32:37.030 --> 00:32:38.979
What is our quality of life?

734
00:32:39.390 --> 00:32:40.949
I asked an English man,

735
00:32:41.150 --> 00:32:41.560
I said,

736
00:32:41.670 --> 00:32:42.699
what is the

737
00:32:43.270 --> 00:32:44.060
uh

738
00:32:44.829 --> 00:32:46.500
quality of an Englishman?

739
00:32:47.030 --> 00:32:47.579
He said,

740
00:32:48.189 --> 00:32:51.810
It depends on how many times he goes for a see is hot.

741
00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:53.020
Can you imagine?

742
00:32:54.099 --> 00:32:54.800
What?

743
00:32:55.199 --> 00:32:56.260
Sea resort.

744
00:32:56.719 --> 00:32:59.829
How many years back did you start going to the sea resort?

745
00:33:00.770 --> 00:33:03.160
I don't think we never heard about it in India.

746
00:33:03.790 --> 00:33:05.420
It's about 25 years back,

747
00:33:05.540 --> 00:33:07.650
somebody stupid fellow must be

748
00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:10.050
or somebody very clever maybe.

749
00:33:10.699 --> 00:33:11.829
But this idea

750
00:33:12.099 --> 00:33:15.589
that we all should go to the resort because we must get our skin

751
00:33:15.859 --> 00:33:16.849
full of cancer.

752
00:33:18.829 --> 00:33:21.650
So the quality of a

753
00:33:22.719 --> 00:33:23.349
Person

754
00:33:24.630 --> 00:33:25.250
Doesn't

755
00:33:26.989 --> 00:33:31.979
On a mental acceptance of something that looks new.

756
00:33:36.030 --> 00:33:38.630
And that's what is happening to all of us is

757
00:33:39.270 --> 00:33:40.819
anything new that comes.

758
00:33:41.959 --> 00:33:45.069
We accept it and we think we have equality.

759
00:33:45.890 --> 00:33:48.500
If a lady goes supposing to a disease resort.

760
00:33:49.780 --> 00:33:53.349
Because I meet other kind also who are not seekers at all.

761
00:33:53.959 --> 00:33:57.800
She'll come and tell and say now see what a tan I have.

762
00:33:58.640 --> 00:33:58.949
I mean,

763
00:33:58.989 --> 00:34:00.349
it's so superficial,

764
00:34:00.430 --> 00:34:01.550
it's so frivolous,

765
00:34:01.630 --> 00:34:03.109
it's so nonsensical.

766
00:34:05.719 --> 00:34:06.160
I mean,

767
00:34:06.300 --> 00:34:08.458
is this the value of your life?

768
00:34:11.379 --> 00:34:14.989
You have come out of amoeba stage to this stage,

769
00:34:15.199 --> 00:34:17.469
and what are you doing about yourself?

770
00:34:18.688 --> 00:34:19.550
Making it 1

771
00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:24.010
That sometimes really

772
00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:26.290
makes me feel very disappointed.

773
00:34:27.978 --> 00:34:30.560
And this is such a common topic all over.

774
00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:33.850
What are we?

775
00:34:35.398 --> 00:34:37.039
We are human beings.

776
00:34:39.370 --> 00:34:45.790
We have come out of amoeba to other stage and other stages in thousands of years.

777
00:34:46.100 --> 00:34:48.478
Today we are human beings.

778
00:34:52.540 --> 00:34:55.060
Make to achieve something great.

779
00:34:56.478 --> 00:34:58.120
Nature has worked on us

780
00:34:58.540 --> 00:34:59.949
relentlessly,

781
00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:01.399
so beautifully,

782
00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:02.510
so delicately,

783
00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:03.949
so lovingly,

784
00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:04.879
for what?

785
00:35:07.989 --> 00:35:10.260
And when we just become mental

786
00:35:10.979 --> 00:35:11.929
according to

787
00:35:13.020 --> 00:35:14.169
Indian philosophers,

788
00:35:14.399 --> 00:35:15.370
a mental person.

789
00:35:16.030 --> 00:35:17.979
is nothing but a stupid fellow.

790
00:35:19.719 --> 00:35:21.750
egoistical person he becomes,

791
00:35:21.850 --> 00:35:24.449
and he becomes nothing but a stupid fellow.

792
00:35:26.389 --> 00:35:26.939
Because

793
00:35:27.350 --> 00:35:29.530
anything that comes of the mental

794
00:35:29.909 --> 00:35:30.629
expression.

795
00:35:32.439 --> 00:35:35.120
Today I was only watching about the modern art.

796
00:35:36.310 --> 00:35:37.699
Modern art is all right.

797
00:35:37.870 --> 00:35:39.020
If you know how to

798
00:35:39.709 --> 00:35:41.179
become super modern,

799
00:35:41.510 --> 00:35:42.689
that is a real life so.

800
00:35:45.530 --> 00:35:46.870
But this modern art.

801
00:35:47.709 --> 00:35:48.409
was

802
00:35:48.620 --> 00:35:50.610
described by a gentleman

803
00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:52.899
and then ultimately got

804
00:35:53.489 --> 00:35:55.739
into the real mood of saying something.

805
00:35:56.469 --> 00:35:57.639
That is the truth

806
00:35:58.300 --> 00:35:59.179
He said

807
00:35:59.570 --> 00:36:02.520
that this all expression shows that we were barbaric

808
00:36:02.770 --> 00:36:04.729
and now we have become worse than barbaric.

809
00:36:10.209 --> 00:36:12.790
So the whole expression of our life.

810
00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:17.590
I

811
00:36:18.419 --> 00:36:21.290
Something that we have done out of our mental thing,

812
00:36:21.340 --> 00:36:23.939
we are so much in in imbalance.

813
00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:28.209
Now the main thing.

814
00:36:29.169 --> 00:36:30.639
One has to understand

815
00:36:30.889 --> 00:36:32.159
that you

816
00:36:33.159 --> 00:36:35.360
are made a human being by

817
00:36:35.909 --> 00:36:36.909
the kindness,

818
00:36:36.949 --> 00:36:39.389
the grace of the nature.

819
00:36:41.419 --> 00:36:43.679
Of God Almighty as I call it.

820
00:36:46.669 --> 00:36:47.679
Not by you.

821
00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:52.239
Not by mental thought.

822
00:36:54.449 --> 00:36:56.320
You have a special value.

823
00:36:57.320 --> 00:36:58.149
You have a very,

824
00:36:58.209 --> 00:37:00.399
very special value in the.

825
00:37:01.340 --> 00:37:02.250
Eyes

826
00:37:02.570 --> 00:37:03.570
of the nature.

827
00:37:05.149 --> 00:37:06.040
In the

828
00:37:06.419 --> 00:37:07.229
working

829
00:37:07.620 --> 00:37:08.290
of

830
00:37:09.050 --> 00:37:11.090
The evolutionary process.

831
00:37:14.850 --> 00:37:15.939
Have we

832
00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:21.270
got any concept as to what is expected out of us?

833
00:37:28.050 --> 00:37:30.870
Are we to waste our life?

834
00:37:33.699 --> 00:37:36.340
Into these frivolous stupid things,

835
00:37:36.409 --> 00:37:38.320
doing everything very seriously though.

836
00:37:41.129 --> 00:37:43.080
They're very serious about all stupidity,

837
00:37:43.239 --> 00:37:45.699
especially they talk for a greater stupidity.

838
00:37:45.719 --> 00:37:46.639
They are more serious.

839
00:37:47.340 --> 00:37:50.010
The thing without that there won't be any impression on people.

840
00:37:52.870 --> 00:37:55.879
But the main thing is we have missed the point.

841
00:37:58.330 --> 00:38:01.590
The point is you have to be the spirit.

842
00:38:04.030 --> 00:38:07.340
All these doings are to be the spirit.

843
00:38:07.429 --> 00:38:08.659
It's not talking,

844
00:38:08.830 --> 00:38:10.580
it's not your mental projections,

845
00:38:10.709 --> 00:38:12.750
all your new ideas coming up and going up.

846
00:38:12.790 --> 00:38:13.699
It's not that.

847
00:38:13.830 --> 00:38:14.540
It is

848
00:38:14.830 --> 00:38:16.949
you have to be the spirit.

849
00:38:18.229 --> 00:38:18.709
Face it.

850
00:38:24.770 --> 00:38:27.189
This you cannot purchase in the market.

851
00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:27.959
You cannot.

852
00:38:30.629 --> 00:38:32.350
You cannot put in any effort.

853
00:38:32.439 --> 00:38:33.870
Now you are that

854
00:38:34.399 --> 00:38:35.899
just to become that.

855
00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:38.070
That's what your quality is.

856
00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:40.879
That's what I see you as.

857
00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:48.520
Or anybody who is a realised soul.

858
00:38:50.479 --> 00:38:54.310
But what do you see yourself as is the main point.

859
00:38:56.290 --> 00:38:58.560
That's why there cannot be much report.

860
00:39:06.389 --> 00:39:09.250
Anything new that is brought to you.

861
00:39:09.699 --> 00:39:09.739
Well,

862
00:39:09.780 --> 00:39:10.489
it's nice.

863
00:39:12.419 --> 00:39:12.979
How,

864
00:39:12.989 --> 00:39:13.489
how do you know?

865
00:39:15.159 --> 00:39:18.080
Traditions we have put on one side because tradition means

866
00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:19.979
all conditioning,

867
00:39:20.399 --> 00:39:20.959
all

868
00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:22.159
wrong things,

869
00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:23.590
tradition we don't want,

870
00:39:23.770 --> 00:39:24.120
right.

871
00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:26.239
So now

872
00:39:26.570 --> 00:39:27.919
what are you clinging to?

873
00:39:28.409 --> 00:39:30.879
At least tradition had one safe point

874
00:39:31.129 --> 00:39:31.679
that

875
00:39:32.209 --> 00:39:33.060
trial and error,

876
00:39:33.070 --> 00:39:34.840
you have found out something sensible.

877
00:39:35.370 --> 00:39:37.520
Now you put tradition all nonsense.

878
00:39:37.770 --> 00:39:38.090
Why?

879
00:39:40.070 --> 00:39:43.229
Because you cannot take out the good out of that tradition.

880
00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:46.790
So now you are going to the other side.

881
00:39:47.790 --> 00:39:48.310
Saying all right,

882
00:39:48.429 --> 00:39:49.389
no tradition

883
00:39:49.830 --> 00:39:51.139
we have this new style.

884
00:39:51.629 --> 00:39:53.790
We don't want to be covered by any tradition.

885
00:39:55.889 --> 00:39:57.280
Like people might say,

886
00:39:57.610 --> 00:39:58.879
what is in a

887
00:39:59.729 --> 00:40:01.729
painting of say.

888
00:40:06.189 --> 00:40:06.669
Marlo,

889
00:40:06.949 --> 00:40:08.340
whom I like very much,

890
00:40:08.709 --> 00:40:08.979
say.

891
00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:11.100
What is so great?

892
00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:13.340
We can do some drip painting.

893
00:40:13.419 --> 00:40:14.909
They have drip painting.

894
00:40:15.139 --> 00:40:17.729
I don't know what sort of paintings they have these days.

895
00:40:17.899 --> 00:40:18.770
Why should we?

896
00:40:19.100 --> 00:40:21.500
You can't do even one painting like that.

897
00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:26.510
You can't even reproduce.

898
00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:28.629
You cannot think of such a painting.

899
00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:30.379
Face it,

900
00:40:31.229 --> 00:40:31.919
Modern

901
00:40:32.310 --> 00:40:35.270
mind is incapable of conceiving that.

902
00:40:37.989 --> 00:40:38.750
Exit

903
00:40:39.350 --> 00:40:40.899
You have gone down in quality.

904
00:40:41.889 --> 00:40:42.340
Why?

905
00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:44.350
Because

906
00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:46.060
of mental

907
00:40:46.909 --> 00:40:47.810
Movement

908
00:40:49.929 --> 00:40:51.760
It's such a limited movement.

909
00:40:52.739 --> 00:40:53.409
But

910
00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:56.409
those people believed in something

911
00:40:56.760 --> 00:40:57.320
higher.

912
00:40:58.669 --> 00:40:59.260
High

913
00:40:59.780 --> 00:41:01.110
higher ideals.

914
00:41:01.830 --> 00:41:02.889
They thought

915
00:41:03.020 --> 00:41:03.889
of God.

916
00:41:03.939 --> 00:41:04.810
They thought

917
00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:07.419
of perfecting themselves.

918
00:41:09.850 --> 00:41:12.520
Not putting the chaos in your heart outside,

919
00:41:12.649 --> 00:41:12.810
no,

920
00:41:12.969 --> 00:41:13.570
perfect.

921
00:41:15.030 --> 00:41:16.300
Resting in that.

922
00:41:17.860 --> 00:41:19.209
Believing in that,

923
00:41:19.459 --> 00:41:21.100
in that peaceful atmosphere,

924
00:41:21.219 --> 00:41:24.429
they created something that you cannot produce.

925
00:41:24.739 --> 00:41:25.969
Only thing what you can do,

926
00:41:26.100 --> 00:41:26.969
I don't like it.

927
00:41:29.020 --> 00:41:30.399
Like in my house.

928
00:41:31.229 --> 00:41:33.770
I was screen made in S Saranpur a long time back.

929
00:41:33.850 --> 00:41:34.850
It's beautifully done.

930
00:41:34.929 --> 00:41:35.739
It has got

931
00:41:36.129 --> 00:41:38.449
beautiful honeycomb work which no one can.

932
00:41:39.729 --> 00:41:41.659
Found some people came to see.

933
00:41:41.969 --> 00:41:43.120
I don't like it.

934
00:41:43.649 --> 00:41:44.280
I said,

935
00:41:44.370 --> 00:41:47.879
Can you make even 3 inches of that.

936
00:41:52.239 --> 00:41:55.760
That's the only thing you can do is to say I don't like it finished.

937
00:41:56.219 --> 00:41:58.500
Can you do 3 inches?

938
00:41:58.699 --> 00:41:59.419
Can you?

939
00:42:00.310 --> 00:42:01.070
You can't

940
00:42:02.989 --> 00:42:04.260
Accept this fact.

941
00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:06.739
Once you accept this fact,

942
00:42:06.989 --> 00:42:10.189
I'm sure the humility that is needed will come into you.

943
00:42:12.850 --> 00:42:13.969
Humidity is lacking.

944
00:42:15.020 --> 00:42:17.189
Seekers must have humility,

945
00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:18.110
otherwise

946
00:42:18.399 --> 00:42:20.449
they will go to people who will pamper their egos,

947
00:42:20.479 --> 00:42:24.300
and they will be drifted into nonsensical until their money is finished,

948
00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:28.810
till they become absolutely lunatics or epileptics.

949
00:42:28.879 --> 00:42:29.500
They will

950
00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:31.840
just continue and finish off.

951
00:42:33.820 --> 00:42:35.179
But to be sensible,

952
00:42:35.270 --> 00:42:36.540
to be sane,

953
00:42:37.110 --> 00:42:39.229
one has to understand.

954
00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:41.120
That

955
00:42:41.570 --> 00:42:44.219
our worth is much more than this.

956
00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:47.360
Like a BBC fellow comes and tells me,

957
00:42:47.439 --> 00:42:47.949
I mean,

958
00:42:47.959 --> 00:42:49.000
he thinks he's raising you,

959
00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:50.870
I don't know what whatever you may call it,

960
00:42:51.080 --> 00:42:53.070
that an Anglo-Saxon brain

961
00:42:53.439 --> 00:42:54.520
cannot understand.

962
00:42:55.320 --> 00:42:58.899
Anything spiritual for which you don't have to pay.

963
00:43:00.620 --> 00:43:01.620
I really tell you,

964
00:43:01.639 --> 00:43:02.479
he said it to me.

965
00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:07.590
And I refused to go on that BBC because I said first of all,

966
00:43:07.709 --> 00:43:09.989
your Anglo-Saxon brain must be all right.

967
00:43:10.949 --> 00:43:12.870
Is it a special brain you have made,

968
00:43:12.899 --> 00:43:14.090
Anglo-Saxon brains?

969
00:43:14.100 --> 00:43:14.649
Are they

970
00:43:14.979 --> 00:43:16.260
specially made by God?

971
00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:23.419
When you say you are Anglo-Saxon brain,

972
00:43:23.479 --> 00:43:25.590
you have absolutely put down your

973
00:43:26.199 --> 00:43:27.399
value down.

974
00:43:28.649 --> 00:43:30.060
And when you say

975
00:43:30.439 --> 00:43:32.149
it's a human brain,

976
00:43:32.590 --> 00:43:34.100
then you are great

977
00:43:34.639 --> 00:43:35.909
because you become

978
00:43:36.479 --> 00:43:37.000
one.

979
00:43:37.729 --> 00:43:39.179
Of that rich

980
00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:40.350
world.

981
00:43:41.639 --> 00:43:43.580
There's no global sense.

982
00:43:43.709 --> 00:43:45.590
We don't have a global sense.

983
00:43:46.340 --> 00:43:47.879
At all within ourselves.

984
00:43:48.129 --> 00:43:50.800
What we have is so localised and

985
00:43:52.060 --> 00:43:53.189
Insular

986
00:43:54.010 --> 00:43:54.439
understanding.

987
00:43:57.469 --> 00:44:00.760
So insular that we just say I don't like it.

988
00:44:00.879 --> 00:44:01.949
I don't want it.

989
00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:02.790
Who is this?

990
00:44:02.919 --> 00:44:03.449
I?

991
00:44:09.949 --> 00:44:13.419
It is only possible when we come to some humility.

992
00:44:14.540 --> 00:44:15.989
With all respect to England

993
00:44:16.340 --> 00:44:18.370
because England to me is very great.

994
00:44:19.590 --> 00:44:21.620
And it's the heart of the universe.

995
00:44:22.129 --> 00:44:24.129
And when I say this in the European countries,

996
00:44:24.250 --> 00:44:27.399
they get rather upset by the what England is the heart.

997
00:44:28.139 --> 00:44:28.949
That's too much,

998
00:44:28.959 --> 00:44:29.159
mother,

999
00:44:29.239 --> 00:44:30.629
we can't digest this.

1000
00:44:31.879 --> 00:44:32.879
It is the heart,

1001
00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:34.469
whether you like it or not.

1002
00:44:35.540 --> 00:44:37.000
It is the heart.

1003
00:44:37.949 --> 00:44:38.639
No doubt.

1004
00:44:42.860 --> 00:44:44.919
But what a heart.

1005
00:44:46.590 --> 00:44:47.350
Can't break it,

1006
00:44:47.370 --> 00:44:47.939
you know.

1007
00:44:49.429 --> 00:44:50.179
Cannot

1008
00:44:50.709 --> 00:44:52.070
make it expand.

1009
00:44:57.159 --> 00:44:59.780
This is the sad part of English is.

1010
00:45:01.949 --> 00:45:02.820
It's the heart.

1011
00:45:02.860 --> 00:45:05.969
It's a very important organ of the universe,

1012
00:45:06.300 --> 00:45:08.459
but the cells that exist here.

1013
00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:15.959
Who are supposed to circulate in the whole world.

1014
00:45:17.659 --> 00:45:20.600
Who have to achieve so many things

1015
00:45:21.169 --> 00:45:22.719
as the cells of the heart.

1016
00:45:23.850 --> 00:45:26.120
achieved by pumping out.

1017
00:45:27.770 --> 00:45:29.479
New refreshed

1018
00:45:29.909 --> 00:45:30.340
blood.

1019
00:45:35.810 --> 00:45:39.510
He is expected to have beautiful heart,

1020
00:45:40.120 --> 00:45:40.989
an Englishman.

1021
00:45:42.540 --> 00:45:44.489
A heart that is to be cherished.

1022
00:45:45.179 --> 00:45:47.850
To be enjoyed and appreciated.

1023
00:45:53.159 --> 00:45:53.909
Where are they?

1024
00:45:56.449 --> 00:45:59.030
With all this expenditure on these people here.

1025
00:46:00.949 --> 00:46:03.129
Previously I used to do it in England,

1026
00:46:03.340 --> 00:46:04.060
but I gave up.

1027
00:46:05.050 --> 00:46:06.620
Exhausted all my bank,

1028
00:46:07.010 --> 00:46:09.979
and how many disciples I get are 7 for 4 years.

1029
00:46:10.750 --> 00:46:12.209
I said give up these people.

1030
00:46:13.139 --> 00:46:14.620
Good for nothing useless.

1031
00:46:15.790 --> 00:46:15.800
All

1032
00:46:16.159 --> 00:46:17.409
the money they spend.

1033
00:46:20.750 --> 00:46:21.659
And what do you find?

1034
00:46:21.699 --> 00:46:22.540
What's the quality?

1035
00:46:22.699 --> 00:46:24.969
How many come up and how many work it out?

1036
00:46:25.260 --> 00:46:27.219
How many care for their self-realization.

1037
00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:34.469
For me

1038
00:46:36.780 --> 00:46:38.199
To say that I work very hard,

1039
00:46:38.280 --> 00:46:39.520
I don't think I work at all.

1040
00:46:39.649 --> 00:46:40.310
I don't work.

1041
00:46:43.189 --> 00:46:44.489
I do not work.

1042
00:46:44.790 --> 00:46:45.620
It emits.

1043
00:46:47.350 --> 00:46:48.120
It's dead

1044
00:46:51.120 --> 00:46:52.510
But it's a waste.

1045
00:46:52.979 --> 00:46:54.370
It's a wasteland.

1046
00:47:02.909 --> 00:47:04.030
How are we going to

1047
00:47:06.100 --> 00:47:07.969
Sow the seed in the wasteland.

1048
00:47:09.500 --> 00:47:11.169
How are we going to work it out?

1049
00:47:14.429 --> 00:47:17.419
Especially London seems to be a rock,

1050
00:47:17.750 --> 00:47:19.659
rock of Gibraltar has come in London,

1051
00:47:19.709 --> 00:47:20.229
I think.

1052
00:47:20.750 --> 00:47:22.350
For this place Wimbledon,

1053
00:47:22.429 --> 00:47:23.340
you'll be surprised.

1054
00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:25.590
We are very fond of tennis,

1055
00:47:25.629 --> 00:47:27.219
so both of us used to come.

1056
00:47:28.639 --> 00:47:29.399
And

1057
00:47:29.610 --> 00:47:30.800
our driver would say,

1058
00:47:30.889 --> 00:47:32.760
we must go one hour early.

1059
00:47:33.290 --> 00:47:33.830
Why?

1060
00:47:34.209 --> 00:47:35.449
You just can't

1061
00:47:35.689 --> 00:47:36.399
get in there.

1062
00:47:37.939 --> 00:47:40.159
And we used to come one hour earlier

1063
00:47:40.770 --> 00:47:44.649
to get into the lanes of these Wimbledan to go and see the tennis.

1064
00:47:48.370 --> 00:47:49.310
And the same

1065
00:47:49.479 --> 00:47:51.290
Wimbledon has 20 people,

1066
00:47:51.439 --> 00:47:52.550
new people over here.

1067
00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:54.199
I really wanted to go back.

1068
00:47:55.370 --> 00:48:00.290
Because I felt what sort of a quality is this that I'm wasting my time.

1069
00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:03.100
We tried everything,

1070
00:48:03.179 --> 00:48:04.830
diplomatic relationship,

1071
00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:05.229
food,

1072
00:48:05.239 --> 00:48:06.270
we invited them,

1073
00:48:06.399 --> 00:48:07.389
give them food,

1074
00:48:07.679 --> 00:48:07.989
uh,

1075
00:48:08.239 --> 00:48:08.929
tea,

1076
00:48:09.250 --> 00:48:10.340
Indian tea,

1077
00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:12.310
all kinds of things we tried.

1078
00:48:13.649 --> 00:48:15.919
That a mother should try her level best.

1079
00:48:16.750 --> 00:48:18.570
You don't understand this.

1080
00:48:23.500 --> 00:48:23.969
Of course,

1081
00:48:24.050 --> 00:48:25.530
the Indians who are here

1082
00:48:25.850 --> 00:48:27.320
are all uprooted people.

1083
00:48:27.620 --> 00:48:29.060
I don't call them Indians at all.

1084
00:48:29.850 --> 00:48:30.500
Most of them.

1085
00:48:31.330 --> 00:48:32.580
That just uprooted people.

1086
00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:35.790
They don't understand the value of their life,

1087
00:48:35.909 --> 00:48:36.149
no.

1088
00:48:37.669 --> 00:48:38.419
Most of them

1089
00:48:39.500 --> 00:48:39.860
Of course,

1090
00:48:39.899 --> 00:48:41.530
there are some sensible people also,

1091
00:48:41.899 --> 00:48:42.489
no doubt.

1092
00:48:44.209 --> 00:48:44.830
very few

1093
00:48:45.560 --> 00:48:48.500
So now what are we to do supposing

1094
00:48:48.709 --> 00:48:51.399
there is something great that has to happen to this world.

1095
00:48:52.179 --> 00:48:54.729
And that you are the ones who have to be blessed.

1096
00:48:55.520 --> 00:48:56.399
Can you believe it?

1097
00:48:56.560 --> 00:48:58.120
I've been here for 12 years now.

1098
00:48:58.199 --> 00:48:59.429
It will be the 12th year.

1099
00:49:05.330 --> 00:49:05.820
But

1100
00:49:06.929 --> 00:49:08.689
There's a guru who wants

1101
00:49:09.090 --> 00:49:09.810
a Rolls-Royce.

1102
00:49:09.889 --> 00:49:11.250
He's already got 58,

1103
00:49:11.330 --> 00:49:12.610
he wants a 59.

1104
00:49:13.010 --> 00:49:16.280
There are 60,000 people here

1105
00:49:16.449 --> 00:49:19.800
who are buying a Rolls-Royce for that

1106
00:49:20.330 --> 00:49:20.810
person.

1107
00:49:23.810 --> 00:49:26.840
What happens to your brains I can't understand.

1108
00:49:30.179 --> 00:49:31.840
Is that the spirit?

1109
00:49:32.379 --> 00:49:34.209
Is that what you are seeking?

1110
00:49:35.260 --> 00:49:36.560
Understatement,

1111
00:49:36.610 --> 00:49:37.600
I understand,

1112
00:49:37.889 --> 00:49:40.209
but undervaluing I don't understand.

1113
00:49:43.399 --> 00:49:45.909
No value for your own being,

1114
00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:47.320
not for your own.

1115
00:49:50.189 --> 00:49:52.860
Evolution and for your own.

1116
00:49:53.510 --> 00:49:54.449
Personality.

1117
00:50:00.250 --> 00:50:02.050
I tell you I've done

1118
00:50:02.159 --> 00:50:03.199
everything under the sun.

1119
00:50:03.949 --> 00:50:04.719
In this country,

1120
00:50:05.179 --> 00:50:07.409
in India I've hardly worked for 2 years,

1121
00:50:07.659 --> 00:50:11.780
and we have thousands and thousands of people who are surists there.

1122
00:50:12.739 --> 00:50:14.580
Our country is going to change very fast,

1123
00:50:14.659 --> 00:50:15.340
I know that.

1124
00:50:16.750 --> 00:50:18.159
It will work out even

1125
00:50:20.989 --> 00:50:22.530
In so many other countries.

1126
00:50:23.659 --> 00:50:24.719
But England

1127
00:50:29.860 --> 00:50:30.459
William Blake,

1128
00:50:30.540 --> 00:50:31.090
I don't know.

1129
00:50:31.820 --> 00:50:32.800
He dreamt

1130
00:50:33.530 --> 00:50:36.709
so great about England because he knew the quality of England

1131
00:50:37.159 --> 00:50:38.320
that Jerusalem.

1132
00:50:39.439 --> 00:50:40.340
Do you think

1133
00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:42.820
You still hope what he said.

1134
00:50:48.399 --> 00:50:50.209
You have such an advantage

1135
00:50:50.469 --> 00:50:51.620
of your language.

1136
00:50:53.310 --> 00:50:54.929
You have such an advantage.

1137
00:50:55.649 --> 00:50:58.620
That you can read about so many things.

1138
00:50:59.030 --> 00:51:03.030
Most of the books of philosophy are translated into your language.

1139
00:51:04.139 --> 00:51:06.280
You're especially being blessed.

1140
00:51:08.020 --> 00:51:09.840
By so much of knowledge.

1141
00:51:11.469 --> 00:51:12.790
Despite that,

1142
00:51:13.189 --> 00:51:13.699
why,

1143
00:51:13.820 --> 00:51:15.939
why people are

1144
00:51:16.500 --> 00:51:16.510
So

1145
00:51:17.060 --> 00:51:17.489
much

1146
00:51:19.260 --> 00:51:21.689
Unaware of their worth.

1147
00:51:22.659 --> 00:51:23.919
Of their

1148
00:51:24.209 --> 00:51:25.129
deserving

1149
00:51:25.709 --> 00:51:26.439
capacity.

1150
00:51:27.479 --> 00:51:28.840
What do they deserve?

1151
00:51:30.379 --> 00:51:31.010
Let's see

1152
00:51:34.979 --> 00:51:34.989
I

1153
00:51:36.870 --> 00:51:40.360
The expectation of the disasters that are going to come

1154
00:51:40.649 --> 00:51:43.600
or horrible things that are going to happen in this world,

1155
00:51:43.929 --> 00:51:44.919
all these things,

1156
00:51:45.040 --> 00:51:49.370
do we deserve or do we deserve some sort of a great hope for ourselves?

1157
00:51:51.580 --> 00:51:53.350
And everything is within you.

1158
00:51:53.360 --> 00:51:55.600
You can see that it's all there.

1159
00:51:55.810 --> 00:51:56.639
It's your own.

1160
00:51:57.439 --> 00:51:58.489
Why shouldn't you have it?

1161
00:52:01.689 --> 00:52:03.600
I mean we've tried everything.

1162
00:52:04.260 --> 00:52:06.080
To push you down to that point

1163
00:52:06.649 --> 00:52:07.540
every way,

1164
00:52:07.850 --> 00:52:13.120
every method as in Sanskrit they say kamane the 5 things we have tried.

1165
00:52:14.129 --> 00:52:15.080
To work it out

1166
00:52:16.070 --> 00:52:19.600
So now only another thing is to push people with pistons up there

1167
00:52:19.770 --> 00:52:20.840
and keep them waiting.

1168
00:52:22.959 --> 00:52:24.280
That also perhaps you've done,

1169
00:52:24.399 --> 00:52:24.969
isn't it?

1170
00:52:36.020 --> 00:52:38.239
The whole world is looking at you,

1171
00:52:38.570 --> 00:52:39.169
remember that.

1172
00:52:41.419 --> 00:52:42.709
Not big talking,

1173
00:52:43.399 --> 00:52:44.479
not big saying.

1174
00:52:45.239 --> 00:52:45.679
But

1175
00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:47.479
the big thing happening with you.

1176
00:52:48.510 --> 00:52:50.889
Is actualization of that great thing.

1177
00:52:51.800 --> 00:52:53.179
Which is so simple.

1178
00:52:54.379 --> 00:52:55.320
So beautiful.

1179
00:52:56.320 --> 00:52:58.350
It takes hardly anything.

1180
00:52:59.370 --> 00:53:01.120
For you to become your spirit.

1181
00:53:02.870 --> 00:53:04.320
But to maintain it,

1182
00:53:04.770 --> 00:53:05.800
to respect it,

1183
00:53:05.929 --> 00:53:07.040
and to be there.

1184
00:53:07.449 --> 00:53:09.739
I don't know what sort of a special glue

1185
00:53:09.969 --> 00:53:10.840
we should have.

1186
00:53:11.449 --> 00:53:13.040
They just don't stick on.

1187
00:53:13.330 --> 00:53:15.060
They meet me on the shop,

1188
00:53:15.209 --> 00:53:15.540
Mother.

1189
00:53:16.550 --> 00:53:17.000
I said,

1190
00:53:17.050 --> 00:53:17.729
how?

1191
00:53:18.010 --> 00:53:18.169
Oh,

1192
00:53:18.209 --> 00:53:18.739
you don't know.

1193
00:53:18.850 --> 00:53:20.290
I came to it 12 years back.

1194
00:53:20.370 --> 00:53:21.370
You gave me a realisation.

1195
00:53:21.560 --> 00:53:21.689
All right,

1196
00:53:21.790 --> 00:53:23.000
now what are you doing about it?

1197
00:53:24.629 --> 00:53:24.840
Mother,

1198
00:53:24.889 --> 00:53:25.530
I lost it,

1199
00:53:25.540 --> 00:53:25.959
you know.

1200
00:53:26.929 --> 00:53:27.449
Really?

1201
00:53:31.429 --> 00:53:32.379
It's very common,

1202
00:53:32.620 --> 00:53:33.620
very common phenomenon.

1203
00:53:36.850 --> 00:53:38.709
So those who are here today,

1204
00:53:39.070 --> 00:53:40.219
20 people

1205
00:53:40.510 --> 00:53:41.790
I hope are special.

1206
00:53:45.209 --> 00:53:46.449
And they consider

1207
00:53:46.600 --> 00:53:48.560
this experience as something special.

1208
00:53:52.510 --> 00:53:53.139
and

1209
00:53:53.260 --> 00:53:54.729
establish themselves.

1210
00:53:56.139 --> 00:53:57.850
As great saints.

1211
00:54:00.280 --> 00:54:03.199
Knowing everything about their own powers.

1212
00:54:06.219 --> 00:54:07.879
It's all has to be free.

1213
00:54:08.879 --> 00:54:10.219
You cannot pay for it.

1214
00:54:15.330 --> 00:54:16.800
I'm really frustrated.

1215
00:54:16.879 --> 00:54:17.270
I must.

1216
00:54:19.100 --> 00:54:21.320
I was going away this time

1217
00:54:21.649 --> 00:54:22.080
to India,

1218
00:54:22.100 --> 00:54:23.040
I would have been there.

1219
00:54:25.250 --> 00:54:25.870
But

1220
00:54:25.989 --> 00:54:26.969
as you say,

1221
00:54:27.229 --> 00:54:29.709
one is more concerned about the lost lambs.

1222
00:54:31.070 --> 00:54:32.209
India is very easy.

1223
00:54:34.709 --> 00:54:36.010
So I'm stuck back.

1224
00:54:36.820 --> 00:54:37.820
I hope

1225
00:54:38.199 --> 00:54:39.760
you are not going to disappoint me,

1226
00:54:39.800 --> 00:54:41.510
those who have come for the first time.

1227
00:54:42.389 --> 00:54:43.020
Please

1228
00:54:43.459 --> 00:54:44.989
record hasti his tricks.

1229
00:54:46.360 --> 00:54:47.659
Everybody tries.

1230
00:54:48.639 --> 00:54:49.810
But I don't know

1231
00:54:50.060 --> 00:54:51.580
how to make people stick.

1232
00:54:52.540 --> 00:54:53.959
A surprising

1233
00:54:55.179 --> 00:54:55.850
In the West,

1234
00:54:55.929 --> 00:54:58.100
people have developed the best quality glues.

1235
00:54:58.129 --> 00:55:02.320
We cannot develop such in India or any developing countries don't have glues.

1236
00:55:03.699 --> 00:55:05.449
But as far as they are concerned,

1237
00:55:05.530 --> 00:55:07.399
they cannot stick on to

1238
00:55:07.729 --> 00:55:09.199
anything whatsoever.

1239
00:55:11.659 --> 00:55:13.090
They cannot stick onto their wives.

1240
00:55:13.169 --> 00:55:14.370
They cannot stick on to their husbands.

1241
00:55:14.409 --> 00:55:15.919
They cannot stick on to their houses.

1242
00:55:16.030 --> 00:55:17.169
They cannot stick on to

1243
00:55:17.929 --> 00:55:19.389
anything whatsoever.

1244
00:55:20.050 --> 00:55:22.770
What has to grow has to stick on somewhere.

1245
00:55:26.149 --> 00:55:27.659
If you have to make a bell.

1246
00:55:28.489 --> 00:55:30.159
Then you find some bottle,

1247
00:55:30.330 --> 00:55:31.639
then you dig it down.

1248
00:55:32.050 --> 00:55:32.989
Then you dig one,

1249
00:55:33.050 --> 00:55:33.669
then another,

1250
00:55:33.750 --> 00:55:34.340
then another,

1251
00:55:34.429 --> 00:55:35.280
then go about.

1252
00:55:36.120 --> 00:55:37.110
That's not the way.

1253
00:55:40.229 --> 00:55:42.290
There has to be that

1254
00:55:42.870 --> 00:55:45.459
breaking into the debt that you are.

1255
00:55:45.590 --> 00:55:47.110
There has to be that.

1256
00:55:48.010 --> 00:55:49.159
Happening where

1257
00:55:49.370 --> 00:55:52.159
you break into your own depth,

1258
00:55:52.370 --> 00:55:53.810
your own quality,

1259
00:55:54.050 --> 00:55:55.649
your own wealth.

1260
00:55:56.780 --> 00:55:58.100
But that time

1261
00:55:58.800 --> 00:55:59.969
You don't give

1262
00:56:00.620 --> 00:56:01.879
You don't give to yourself.

1263
00:56:01.939 --> 00:56:03.919
You have no time for yourself.

1264
00:56:04.090 --> 00:56:06.679
You have time for all kinds of nonsensical things,

1265
00:56:06.889 --> 00:56:09.479
but no time for yourself to see

1266
00:56:09.889 --> 00:56:11.209
what beauty lies,

1267
00:56:11.290 --> 00:56:12.989
what glory lies

1268
00:56:13.770 --> 00:56:14.689
behind this.

1269
00:56:16.110 --> 00:56:16.659
Body

1270
00:56:20.750 --> 00:56:22.219
About this mind.

1271
00:56:25.070 --> 00:56:27.659
And below these emotions.

1272
00:56:34.060 --> 00:56:35.189
I do not know

1273
00:56:36.080 --> 00:56:38.350
Any other method is possible now.

1274
00:56:39.889 --> 00:56:41.969
I must say I give up.

1275
00:56:42.239 --> 00:56:43.719
I've tried everything.

1276
00:56:46.550 --> 00:56:47.270
And

1277
00:56:47.419 --> 00:56:49.179
as you have heard about Sir Yoga,

1278
00:56:49.260 --> 00:56:50.270
it's a fact.

1279
00:56:51.209 --> 00:56:53.110
There's no doubt about it.

1280
00:56:53.629 --> 00:56:55.340
There's nothing to lose.

1281
00:56:55.719 --> 00:56:57.310
You are the spirit.

1282
00:56:57.520 --> 00:56:59.439
You have to become the spirit.

1283
00:57:00.570 --> 00:57:03.570
It must relate to the traditional expression

1284
00:57:03.889 --> 00:57:04.560
of

1285
00:57:04.810 --> 00:57:05.729
your revolution.

1286
00:57:06.389 --> 00:57:08.540
It cannot cut out all the saints.

1287
00:57:09.550 --> 00:57:10.419
All the

1288
00:57:10.790 --> 00:57:12.189
great prophets,

1289
00:57:12.510 --> 00:57:14.510
all the great religious leaders,

1290
00:57:14.550 --> 00:57:15.469
it cannot go down.

1291
00:57:16.540 --> 00:57:18.050
But it integrates.

1292
00:57:19.159 --> 00:57:24.659
All the essences of these great adventure came on this earth to guide us.

1293
00:57:25.570 --> 00:57:27.840
It does not cut out anywhere.

1294
00:57:30.580 --> 00:57:31.679
And that's what

1295
00:57:31.889 --> 00:57:32.570
he said.

1296
00:57:34.719 --> 00:57:35.600
Such as you know,

1297
00:57:35.820 --> 00:57:37.310
it was spontaneous.

1298
00:57:38.189 --> 00:57:38.770
Now,

1299
00:57:39.389 --> 00:57:43.790
spontaneous can be quite misrepresented if you use through your brains.

1300
00:57:45.239 --> 00:57:47.919
Spontaneous means it's a living process.

1301
00:57:49.090 --> 00:57:51.179
That should happen to all of you,

1302
00:57:51.229 --> 00:57:52.899
and don't miss the point.

1303
00:57:54.560 --> 00:57:56.560
You have to spend at least

1304
00:57:58.409 --> 00:57:59.719
A month

1305
00:58:00.159 --> 00:58:00.989
to see.

1306
00:58:01.659 --> 00:58:03.639
The light that you have got.

1307
00:58:06.459 --> 00:58:09.679
is to be carried much deeper into you.

1308
00:58:10.010 --> 00:58:11.199
You are deep.

1309
00:58:11.689 --> 00:58:12.689
You are great.

1310
00:58:13.620 --> 00:58:16.370
But if you have to find the pearls that are hidden.

1311
00:58:18.090 --> 00:58:20.120
You have to go deep down.

1312
00:58:20.899 --> 00:58:23.810
It's very simple because the more you go.

1313
00:58:24.719 --> 00:58:26.129
Deeper into yourself,

1314
00:58:26.419 --> 00:58:28.050
the more you enjoy,

1315
00:58:28.300 --> 00:58:29.620
the more you become.

1316
00:58:30.810 --> 00:58:31.389
A

1317
00:58:31.679 --> 00:58:33.209
wholesome personality.

1318
00:58:34.719 --> 00:58:36.300
A greater personality.

1319
00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:38.949
A personality that sees.

1320
00:58:40.239 --> 00:58:42.760
Everything on a universal level.

1321
00:58:43.699 --> 00:58:46.729
And understand everything that is global.

1322
00:58:49.820 --> 00:58:51.330
I'm sorry today

1323
00:58:51.649 --> 00:58:52.689
I am not.

1324
00:58:54.239 --> 00:58:55.320
In my real

1325
00:58:56.830 --> 00:58:57.520
Proper

1326
00:59:00.629 --> 00:59:01.780
Mood I should say

1327
00:59:03.879 --> 00:59:04.560
Because

1328
00:59:04.840 --> 00:59:07.110
I know how much these people have done.

1329
00:59:07.379 --> 00:59:08.439
They have advertised.

1330
00:59:08.479 --> 00:59:09.370
They've gone down.

1331
00:59:10.959 --> 00:59:13.780
They have put up advertisements everywhere,

1332
00:59:13.989 --> 00:59:17.239
put up so much money and that what standard time,

1333
00:59:17.350 --> 00:59:17.810
so what,

1334
00:59:17.879 --> 00:59:18.790
what was this?

1335
00:59:19.850 --> 00:59:20.520
Oh God,

1336
00:59:20.560 --> 00:59:21.270
and that

1337
00:59:21.600 --> 00:59:23.429
times also times

1338
00:59:23.800 --> 00:59:26.199
takes so much money out of your pockets.

1339
00:59:27.699 --> 00:59:28.800
Just think of it.

1340
00:59:29.830 --> 00:59:30.790
They are like gurus,

1341
00:59:30.870 --> 00:59:31.399
you see.

1342
00:59:34.270 --> 00:59:37.689
All that to spend and what do you get out of it.

1343
00:59:37.739 --> 00:59:38.729
One feels so

1344
00:59:39.090 --> 00:59:39.790
sad.

1345
00:59:39.820 --> 00:59:41.209
It's very sad.

1346
00:59:45.449 --> 00:59:45.860
Of course,

1347
00:59:45.969 --> 00:59:47.560
America is so much worse

1348
00:59:47.929 --> 00:59:51.959
that relatively you don't feel that sad when you think of America.

1349
01:00:01.199 --> 01:00:01.709
But

1350
01:00:03.939 --> 01:00:06.459
After describing all the American art today,

1351
01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:07.530
the gentleman

1352
01:00:07.860 --> 01:00:09.080
came to the conclusion,

1353
01:00:09.139 --> 01:00:10.010
and he said,

1354
01:00:10.669 --> 01:00:12.729
That after seeing all this

1355
01:00:12.899 --> 01:00:13.489
art.

1356
01:00:14.239 --> 01:00:16.270
One reaches a conclusion to say

1357
01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:18.449
that they were barbarians

1358
01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:21.439
and now they have become worst barbarians.

1359
01:00:22.969 --> 01:00:23.659
Oh God,

1360
01:00:23.729 --> 01:00:24.530
I said,

1361
01:00:25.010 --> 01:00:27.040
what am I to do with these Americans now?

1362
01:00:27.879 --> 01:00:29.860
But to me you are all my children.

1363
01:00:30.110 --> 01:00:31.030
You are all mine.

1364
01:00:31.770 --> 01:00:34.000
I cannot allow you to be drifted away.

1365
01:00:35.169 --> 01:00:37.750
To the last I'll try to work out.

1366
01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:40.320
I know I feel sometimes very desperate

1367
01:00:40.679 --> 01:00:41.389
and sad.

1368
01:00:46.090 --> 01:00:47.550
English are very much changed now,

1369
01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:49.870
they are so much influenced by the French.

1370
01:00:50.939 --> 01:00:52.179
Now the French are better.

1371
01:00:52.939 --> 01:00:56.969
But they are influenced by the old French and the old Americans,

1372
01:00:57.209 --> 01:00:58.250
not the new ones.

1373
01:00:58.370 --> 01:00:59.770
New ones are very alert.

1374
01:01:02.469 --> 01:01:05.449
So all the old ideas of these

1375
01:01:06.379 --> 01:01:07.290
Nonsensical

1376
01:01:08.090 --> 01:01:12.219
Writers are lingering now in England deposited like in a

1377
01:01:12.610 --> 01:01:14.419
case of angina in the heart,

1378
01:01:14.449 --> 01:01:15.000
you see.

1379
01:01:15.699 --> 01:01:17.679
When there is hardening of the arteries.

1380
01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:19.840
All the

1381
01:01:21.229 --> 01:01:22.040
Bad blood.

1382
01:01:23.909 --> 01:01:26.320
Stagnates like that it's happening.

1383
01:01:26.330 --> 01:01:27.139
I feel

1384
01:01:27.790 --> 01:01:29.260
they have given up these ideas.

1385
01:01:29.469 --> 01:01:30.500
They have rid of it.

1386
01:01:30.629 --> 01:01:31.709
They don't want to have.

1387
01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:34.030
We are still continuing with them.

1388
01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:39.510
Something respectable

1389
01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:40.989
for ourselves.

1390
01:01:42.669 --> 01:01:43.689
That's what I feel.

1391
01:01:46.030 --> 01:01:46.040
Today

1392
01:01:47.379 --> 01:01:47.969
most of them,

1393
01:01:48.139 --> 01:01:48.939
so joke is here,

1394
01:01:49.020 --> 01:01:51.500
I'm sure you'll all get your realisation in no time.

1395
01:01:51.659 --> 01:01:52.580
I'm sure of that.

1396
01:01:53.850 --> 01:01:55.239
But that's not sufficient.

1397
01:01:58.510 --> 01:02:02.790
Out of the 300 we got in Hampstead with all the work these people did,

1398
01:02:02.870 --> 01:02:04.510
advertising this,

1399
01:02:04.550 --> 01:02:04.790
that,

1400
01:02:04.879 --> 01:02:05.909
whatever was possible.

1401
01:02:06.949 --> 01:02:08.179
5 people,

1402
01:02:08.510 --> 01:02:09.260
some or other.

1403
01:02:11.169 --> 01:02:11.929
Stuck on

1404
01:02:12.550 --> 01:02:13.419
And only 3,

1405
01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:13.820
I think,

1406
01:02:13.830 --> 01:02:14.979
with a great glue

1407
01:02:15.820 --> 01:02:16.419
came down.

1408
01:02:18.780 --> 01:02:19.979
That should not happen again.

1409
01:02:21.199 --> 01:02:22.270
So especially

1410
01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:23.550
for the new people,

1411
01:02:23.639 --> 01:02:27.399
I have to tell you that this is something so important that has come to be emboldened.

1412
01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:31.030
All these

1413
01:02:32.510 --> 01:02:35.090
Tennis players have seen them coming and going.

1414
01:02:35.949 --> 01:02:36.949
One comes this year,

1415
01:02:37.070 --> 01:02:38.620
next year he goes away.

1416
01:02:38.989 --> 01:02:40.510
Somebody is today a topsy,

1417
01:02:40.590 --> 01:02:41.620
then he goes down.

1418
01:02:42.590 --> 01:02:43.340
Not in inside.

1419
01:02:44.409 --> 01:02:47.040
You ascend and ascend and ascend

1420
01:02:47.469 --> 01:02:48.360
and ascend

1421
01:02:49.070 --> 01:02:50.120
eternally.

1422
01:02:52.689 --> 01:02:55.120
It's a very different style of tennis.

1423
01:02:59.870 --> 01:03:01.580
It's a real plague.

1424
01:03:03.770 --> 01:03:05.949
It's no professionals are needed,

1425
01:03:05.959 --> 01:03:06.989
you become.

1426
01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:09.879
Such tremendous players.

1427
01:03:11.629 --> 01:03:13.090
Such a game you develop.

1428
01:03:15.860 --> 01:03:20.649
And that's what is there for you just to jump into it and to understand.

1429
01:03:22.719 --> 01:03:23.820
The swimming

1430
01:03:25.610 --> 01:03:27.280
And I'm sure it will work out.

1431
01:03:28.060 --> 01:03:30.639
I hope all those who have come for the first time.

1432
01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:32.919
Will not

1433
01:03:33.870 --> 01:03:36.149
Treat themselves frivolously.

1434
01:03:37.750 --> 01:03:39.489
But we'll stand up to it.

1435
01:03:40.439 --> 01:03:42.379
And give us some encouragement.

1436
01:03:43.719 --> 01:03:45.719
To work out more in England.

1437
01:03:46.090 --> 01:03:46.600
Otherwise,

1438
01:03:46.610 --> 01:03:48.850
maybe tomorrow all the surgeries from

1439
01:03:49.689 --> 01:03:50.919
may come to India.

1440
01:03:52.949 --> 01:03:53.739
With the,

1441
01:03:53.949 --> 01:03:54.850
how do you say

1442
01:03:55.250 --> 01:03:56.169
stock what

1443
01:03:56.949 --> 01:03:57.560
stock lock,

1444
01:03:57.719 --> 01:03:57.959
lock,

1445
01:03:58.070 --> 01:03:58.800
stock and barrel

1446
01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:00.060
lock,

1447
01:04:00.189 --> 01:04:00.419
stock,

1448
01:04:00.429 --> 01:04:01.199
and barrel,

1449
01:04:01.479 --> 01:04:01.790
of course,

1450
01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:03.060
without the barrels.

1451
01:04:07.550 --> 01:04:08.350
Uh let's

1452
01:04:09.189 --> 01:04:10.790
see now how it works out.

1453
01:04:11.149 --> 01:04:12.750
There's nothing serious about it.

1454
01:04:12.830 --> 01:04:15.080
You have to be very pleasantly placed towards yourself.

1455
01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:18.179
This is one thing you should know.

1456
01:04:18.639 --> 01:04:23.379
A person who is godly is never serious.

1457
01:04:26.100 --> 01:04:26.800
Inside

1458
01:04:29.050 --> 01:04:30.379
He's playing the game.

1459
01:04:33.129 --> 01:04:35.969
So in that playful mood of mulan,

1460
01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:37.439
let us see what happens.

1461
01:04:38.459 --> 01:04:39.459
May God bless you.

1462
01:04:43.719 --> 01:04:44.909
Any questions?

1463
01:04:45.790 --> 01:04:46.699
I'll have some water.

1464
01:04:49.409 --> 01:04:49.830
Some water right there.

1465
01:04:51.449 --> 01:04:51.889
Thank you.

1466
01:04:56.879 --> 01:04:56.889
Mhm.

1467
01:05:14.899 --> 01:05:15.489
No.

1468
01:05:17.050 --> 01:05:18.159
That seems to be good.

1469
01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:19.639
Mhm

1470
01:05:23.870 --> 01:05:25.750
You are free to ask questions.

1471
01:05:26.899 --> 01:05:29.610
If you have to achieve complete freedom,

1472
01:05:30.159 --> 01:05:32.020
your freedom is to be respected.

1473
01:05:35.669 --> 01:05:37.780
Your freedom has to be respected.

1474
01:05:38.030 --> 01:05:38.899
It's one question.

1475
01:05:42.229 --> 01:05:42.540
Yes.

1476
01:05:44.959 --> 01:05:45.889
Christian and

1477
01:05:50.479 --> 01:05:51.389
The fundamental

1478
01:05:53.989 --> 01:05:54.070
But

1479
01:05:56.219 --> 01:05:57.000
He's a Christian.

1480
01:05:57.050 --> 01:05:58.120
He does meditation,

1481
01:05:58.169 --> 01:06:00.360
and he wonders whether he's welcome to

1482
01:06:01.120 --> 01:06:01.129
our.

1483
01:06:01.260 --> 01:06:02.040
Very much.

1484
01:06:03.620 --> 01:06:04.729
But if you are a Christian,

1485
01:06:04.810 --> 01:06:05.469
please be seated,

1486
01:06:06.169 --> 01:06:06.879
please be seated.

1487
01:06:09.250 --> 01:06:10.439
Christian is all right.

1488
01:06:10.739 --> 01:06:12.070
Any religion is all right.

1489
01:06:12.260 --> 01:06:13.250
It's all great,

1490
01:06:13.899 --> 01:06:15.580
but it has talked of the future.

1491
01:06:17.139 --> 01:06:18.409
Christ has said,

1492
01:06:19.060 --> 01:06:20.100
I will send you.

1493
01:06:21.639 --> 01:06:22.659
A comforter.

1494
01:06:28.449 --> 01:06:29.239
counsellor

1495
01:06:29.409 --> 01:06:30.320
and a redeemer.

1496
01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:33.909
Why don't the Christians look for someone like that?

1497
01:06:35.100 --> 01:06:36.229
Christ is gone now.

1498
01:06:36.340 --> 01:06:37.020
He's not here.

1499
01:06:41.070 --> 01:06:43.100
Why don't they look out for a holy ghost?

1500
01:06:57.449 --> 01:06:58.800
He himself has said

1501
01:06:59.659 --> 01:07:01.270
Mohammad said that

1502
01:07:01.699 --> 01:07:03.929
during the time of resurrection,

1503
01:07:04.179 --> 01:07:05.699
your hands will speak.

1504
01:07:05.899 --> 01:07:07.139
What about the Muslims?

1505
01:07:13.679 --> 01:07:15.399
Why don't they look out for the resurrection?

1506
01:07:22.189 --> 01:07:22.899
Third

1507
01:07:23.270 --> 01:07:25.590
is Guruan Kabila.

1508
01:07:27.219 --> 01:07:28.449
Nanaka was so great.

1509
01:07:29.649 --> 01:07:33.110
That he combined all the realised souls who

1510
01:07:33.479 --> 01:07:35.760
were poets and made a big

1511
01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:36.949
beautiful

1512
01:07:38.860 --> 01:07:38.889
runs up.

1513
01:07:41.989 --> 01:07:43.290
What are the Sikhs doing?

1514
01:07:43.409 --> 01:07:44.370
They're just reading it,

1515
01:07:44.489 --> 01:07:45.159
reading it.

1516
01:07:49.209 --> 01:07:50.389
He says without

1517
01:07:53.469 --> 01:07:55.219
Knowing yourself,

1518
01:07:55.750 --> 01:07:57.350
you will be an illusion,

1519
01:07:57.469 --> 01:07:58.909
he said very clearly.

1520
01:08:01.090 --> 01:08:03.169
Then should we not look for that?

1521
01:08:04.209 --> 01:08:05.379
But what happens,

1522
01:08:05.639 --> 01:08:07.429
I tell you what's the mistake is.

1523
01:08:07.800 --> 01:08:09.459
Once a religion is organised,

1524
01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:12.000
it neutralises all your

1525
01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:12.919
assent.

1526
01:08:13.570 --> 01:08:14.449
organised.

1527
01:08:19.450 --> 01:08:20.740
I also took my birth

1528
01:08:21.029 --> 01:08:22.189
in the Christian religion.

1529
01:08:23.419 --> 01:08:24.149
So-called,

1530
01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:25.299
I would say.

1531
01:08:26.288 --> 01:08:27.139
Especially

1532
01:08:27.608 --> 01:08:29.008
that two Protestant.

1533
01:08:33.180 --> 01:08:34.839
For particular reasons

1534
01:08:35.259 --> 01:08:36.819
I could have taken birth anywhere else.

1535
01:08:37.950 --> 01:08:38.700
But now

1536
01:08:42.578 --> 01:08:43.639
And there is

1537
01:08:43.889 --> 01:08:45.398
no talk of ascent,

1538
01:08:45.929 --> 01:08:47.568
no talk of a second birth.

1539
01:08:49.240 --> 01:08:52.129
Artificially somebody puts his hand on your head.

1540
01:08:52.600 --> 01:08:53.189
Now

1541
01:08:53.879 --> 01:08:55.729
you are a Christian.

1542
01:08:55.879 --> 01:08:57.160
I don't know how you become.

1543
01:08:59.269 --> 01:09:00.389
Same about Hindus,

1544
01:09:00.587 --> 01:09:02.738
same about every one of them.

1545
01:09:02.828 --> 01:09:03.898
They are leading

1546
01:09:04.148 --> 01:09:05.828
an artificial religion.

1547
01:09:07.569 --> 01:09:08.830
It's a God

1548
01:09:11.009 --> 01:09:12.879
Realities within

1549
01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:18.200
whatever these people have worked and said is not done by them.

1550
01:09:18.240 --> 01:09:21.149
It's become a superficial thing.

1551
01:09:24.109 --> 01:09:27.169
You will not be happy and listen until you find your spirit.

1552
01:09:30.689 --> 01:09:33.049
How can you organise religion?

1553
01:09:33.250 --> 01:09:35.290
How can you organise God?

1554
01:09:39.950 --> 01:09:41.910
Then you think you belong to a church,

1555
01:09:41.950 --> 01:09:43.459
you belong to a

1556
01:09:43.819 --> 01:09:44.700
uh.

1557
01:09:45.769 --> 01:09:48.999
What do you call that a sect or what is it called?

1558
01:09:50.118 --> 01:09:50.868
Another thing,

1559
01:09:50.948 --> 01:09:51.658
something

1560
01:09:53.148 --> 01:09:54.179
denomination.

1561
01:09:55.040 --> 01:09:57.390
All these denominations

1562
01:09:57.879 --> 01:09:58.600
brand us.

1563
01:09:59.729 --> 01:10:01.229
What what's the thing for me?

1564
01:10:01.319 --> 01:10:02.439
All of them are just the same.

1565
01:10:03.910 --> 01:10:05.500
Still groping in the dark,

1566
01:10:05.709 --> 01:10:07.620
how many are seeking reality?

1567
01:10:16.740 --> 01:10:19.399
It's not that Christianity has failed,

1568
01:10:19.529 --> 01:10:21.290
it is the church that has failed.

1569
01:10:26.660 --> 01:10:28.419
Christ can never fail.

1570
01:10:30.509 --> 01:10:31.330
Nor can

1571
01:10:31.580 --> 01:10:32.310
Guruanaka.

1572
01:10:34.700 --> 01:10:36.140
Nor can Mamaa.

1573
01:10:38.379 --> 01:10:41.379
What fails is our understanding of them.

1574
01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:43.640
Let us be the spirit,

1575
01:10:43.720 --> 01:10:45.109
and then we'll understand them.

1576
01:10:45.319 --> 01:10:46.600
They are all one

1577
01:10:46.919 --> 01:10:47.799
hand in hand.

1578
01:10:49.359 --> 01:10:50.430
No difference at all.

1579
01:10:51.790 --> 01:10:52.779
They're all one,

1580
01:10:52.790 --> 01:10:53.299
believe me.

1581
01:11:00.850 --> 01:11:02.439
You don't have to give up anything.

1582
01:11:03.839 --> 01:11:06.140
You have to just see to the essence of it.

1583
01:11:07.870 --> 01:11:09.540
Supposing a leaf is sick.

1584
01:11:10.839 --> 01:11:13.609
You cannot teach it at the leaf end.

1585
01:11:13.779 --> 01:11:15.020
You have to go to the

1586
01:11:15.299 --> 01:11:15.939
roots.

1587
01:11:16.919 --> 01:11:20.069
And when you go to the roots you find you have not given up any leaf.

1588
01:11:20.990 --> 01:11:24.779
You are at the roots and you are at the leaf also everywhere you exist.

1589
01:11:25.919 --> 01:11:29.879
There are so many seekers lost in this kind of denomination.

1590
01:11:32.049 --> 01:11:33.629
So many of them.

1591
01:11:36.950 --> 01:11:39.359
Thank God my parents were real realise suits.

1592
01:11:39.669 --> 01:11:40.390
Thank God.

1593
01:11:42.200 --> 01:11:44.600
Because I found Protestants were.

1594
01:11:45.899 --> 01:11:47.319
Different types of phonetics,

1595
01:11:47.330 --> 01:11:47.509
you see,

1596
01:11:47.569 --> 01:11:48.609
very sophisticated.

1597
01:11:49.939 --> 01:11:52.540
They would never find out that they are phonetics,

1598
01:11:52.709 --> 01:11:53.759
so sophisticated,

1599
01:11:53.810 --> 01:11:54.399
you know,

1600
01:11:54.689 --> 01:11:57.120
if you make anything very sophisticated,

1601
01:11:57.410 --> 01:11:58.569
you can't find it out.

1602
01:12:00.279 --> 01:12:02.629
We can call everybody else a fanatic,

1603
01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:06.549
but a Protestant you can never call because they are a mental people.

1604
01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:08.759
They have made it very sophisticated.

1605
01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:12.919
So if you become

1606
01:12:13.209 --> 01:12:15.930
so very sophisticated that you cannot

1607
01:12:16.290 --> 01:12:17.740
see yourself

1608
01:12:18.330 --> 01:12:19.509
and you cannot

1609
01:12:20.790 --> 01:12:22.020
Make it out

1610
01:12:22.500 --> 01:12:23.709
that it's

1611
01:12:23.990 --> 01:12:27.540
I who's following some sort of a fanaticism,

1612
01:12:27.770 --> 01:12:28.859
an ideology,

1613
01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:30.310
a mental projection.

1614
01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:32.910
How can you get out of it?

1615
01:12:35.080 --> 01:12:36.359
From every religion,

1616
01:12:36.399 --> 01:12:37.229
people will think,

1617
01:12:37.279 --> 01:12:37.359
oh,

1618
01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:39.149
this is fanaticism.

1619
01:12:39.319 --> 01:12:40.089
This is too much.

1620
01:12:42.979 --> 01:12:44.100
But for this

1621
01:12:45.109 --> 01:12:46.490
I may be the first,

1622
01:12:46.629 --> 01:12:48.270
and I hope I'm not the last.

1623
01:12:56.140 --> 01:12:58.580
Martin Luther himself was a realised soul,

1624
01:12:58.700 --> 01:12:59.180
no doubt.

1625
01:13:00.430 --> 01:13:00.899
But

1626
01:13:02.410 --> 01:13:03.330
At that time,

1627
01:13:03.479 --> 01:13:04.470
in that short time,

1628
01:13:04.529 --> 01:13:05.759
with all kinds of

1629
01:13:07.509 --> 01:13:08.629
Oppressions

1630
01:13:08.990 --> 01:13:10.029
and pressures.

1631
01:13:11.509 --> 01:13:12.669
How far could he go?

1632
01:13:14.129 --> 01:13:14.790
And then

1633
01:13:16.020 --> 01:13:17.669
There's already an attack

1634
01:13:18.509 --> 01:13:20.080
built in with Paul.

1635
01:13:21.839 --> 01:13:22.350
And

1636
01:13:22.470 --> 01:13:23.629
then with Augustine.

1637
01:13:24.810 --> 01:13:25.649
What can you do?

1638
01:13:28.410 --> 01:13:32.040
Any realised soul like Khalil Gibran could see it clearly.

1639
01:13:40.979 --> 01:13:41.870
So

1640
01:13:42.180 --> 01:13:43.660
we have to know one thing.

1641
01:13:44.879 --> 01:13:46.520
We have to love the truth.

1642
01:13:48.689 --> 01:13:49.549
Truth

1643
01:13:49.839 --> 01:13:52.160
is to be discovered through your spirit.

1644
01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:56.350
And love your truths and not untruths.

1645
01:14:01.589 --> 01:14:02.970
Any denomination.

1646
01:14:05.850 --> 01:14:06.930
Is untruth.

1647
01:14:08.500 --> 01:14:09.680
What is the truth?

1648
01:14:12.020 --> 01:14:13.569
Is the essence of that.

1649
01:14:17.220 --> 01:14:18.850
Everything is becoming a plastic.

1650
01:14:20.259 --> 01:14:21.520
And then we say

1651
01:14:21.729 --> 01:14:23.279
why people are leaving churches,

1652
01:14:23.529 --> 01:14:26.720
why people are running up from Christian faith or from that faith.

1653
01:14:26.810 --> 01:14:28.299
Nothing wrong with Christ.

1654
01:14:29.250 --> 01:14:29.410
No,

1655
01:14:29.589 --> 01:14:30.560
it's wrong with us.

1656
01:14:31.979 --> 01:14:33.819
That we have made all these

1657
01:14:33.970 --> 01:14:35.240
plastic things.

1658
01:14:37.759 --> 01:14:39.180
To cover his image.

1659
01:14:44.370 --> 01:14:48.160
The greatest justice you can do to Christ is to get your realisation.

1660
01:14:53.149 --> 01:14:54.890
He was crucified for that.

1661
01:14:58.600 --> 01:14:59.970
He came for that

1662
01:15:00.649 --> 01:15:01.970
And he waits for that.

1663
01:15:03.069 --> 01:15:04.000
So please

1664
01:15:04.180 --> 01:15:05.620
get your realisation first,

1665
01:15:05.629 --> 01:15:07.580
and then you will know what is Christ.

1666
01:15:11.939 --> 01:15:13.240
And how great he is.

1667
01:15:15.140 --> 01:15:15.899
May God bless you.

1668
01:15:18.970 --> 01:15:19.950
What else is there?

1669
01:15:19.990 --> 01:15:20.939
Any other question?

1670
01:15:21.029 --> 01:15:22.379
It's a good question

1671
01:15:22.729 --> 01:15:24.259
because that problem faces

1672
01:15:24.540 --> 01:15:25.390
every one of you.

1673
01:15:26.220 --> 01:15:26.770
Let's see.

1674
01:15:32.589 --> 01:15:33.560
Or there could be

1675
01:15:33.950 --> 01:15:35.419
denominations like

1676
01:15:35.870 --> 01:15:36.660
communist,

1677
01:15:36.910 --> 01:15:37.819
capitalist,

1678
01:15:38.470 --> 01:15:39.189
East fist,

1679
01:15:39.240 --> 01:15:40.299
all sorts of things.

1680
01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:42.910
There could be any time.

1681
01:15:45.660 --> 01:15:46.950
I don't know the latest.

1682
01:15:51.720 --> 01:15:52.709
I

1683
01:15:52.979 --> 01:15:55.700
think last counts after anti-culturists.

1684
01:16:01.810 --> 01:16:02.890
There's only one.

1685
01:16:03.790 --> 01:16:06.109
denomination of God is

1686
01:16:06.910 --> 01:16:09.990
I realised soul a yogi one with God.

1687
01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:13.189
As the only one.

1688
01:16:14.169 --> 01:16:15.500
There's no other

1689
01:16:16.779 --> 01:16:17.740
denomination

1690
01:16:18.149 --> 01:16:20.589
where all of them combined Christ.

1691
01:16:21.439 --> 01:16:21.680
Mom

1692
01:16:22.950 --> 01:16:23.919
Loud say

1693
01:16:25.569 --> 01:16:26.680
Socrates

1694
01:16:29.270 --> 01:16:30.109
Krishna

1695
01:16:30.430 --> 01:16:31.419
Rama

1696
01:16:31.899 --> 01:16:33.540
Nanaka Kubira.

1697
01:16:34.359 --> 01:16:35.140
All of them

1698
01:16:36.350 --> 01:16:37.120
Combined

1699
01:16:37.279 --> 01:16:39.680
in that great family of divinity.

1700
01:16:45.720 --> 01:16:46.399
All right,

1701
01:16:46.680 --> 01:16:48.149
so should we

1702
01:16:48.279 --> 01:16:49.319
have realisation?

1703
01:16:50.140 --> 01:16:50.520
I mean,

1704
01:16:50.680 --> 01:16:51.759
most of you have had.

1705
01:16:56.640 --> 01:16:58.839
Is there any question you can ask me?

1706
01:16:58.930 --> 01:16:59.879
I'll be very happy.

1707
01:17:02.419 --> 01:17:04.009
Would it be wrong to assume then.

1708
01:17:06.089 --> 01:17:06.120
getting

1709
01:17:07.629 --> 01:17:08.220
Was he

1710
01:17:09.580 --> 01:17:10.939
It would be wrong to assume.

1711
01:17:13.410 --> 01:17:13.439
Get

1712
01:17:15.859 --> 01:17:16.299
To what

1713
01:17:17.819 --> 01:17:18.779
Is it wrong

1714
01:17:19.250 --> 01:17:21.759
for people who call themselves born again Christians

1715
01:17:23.359 --> 01:17:23.580
to No,

1716
01:17:23.770 --> 01:17:26.479
this is the problem is you cannot call yourself.

1717
01:17:27.049 --> 01:17:28.290
This is a very big problem.

1718
01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:29.290
You see,

1719
01:17:29.319 --> 01:17:30.279
when I went to America,

1720
01:17:30.350 --> 01:17:31.060
I must tell you.

1721
01:17:32.430 --> 01:17:33.990
When I started talking about it,

1722
01:17:34.020 --> 01:17:34.490
they said,

1723
01:17:34.500 --> 01:17:34.939
you must,

1724
01:17:34.979 --> 01:17:36.120
what do you say that

1725
01:17:36.700 --> 01:17:38.069
make it a

1726
01:17:38.700 --> 01:17:41.370
A registration of my speeches.

1727
01:17:41.470 --> 01:17:42.160
What is it called?

1728
01:17:43.729 --> 01:17:45.250
I must have a copyright,

1729
01:17:45.490 --> 01:17:45.919
see.

1730
01:17:47.319 --> 01:17:49.520
Of course I'm very bad at human laws.

1731
01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:50.910
So I said,

1732
01:17:51.060 --> 01:17:51.359
All right,

1733
01:17:51.589 --> 01:17:52.859
now what is that for?

1734
01:17:53.149 --> 01:17:53.459
He said,

1735
01:17:53.470 --> 01:17:54.779
they will try to copy you.

1736
01:17:55.419 --> 01:17:56.520
I said let them copy.

1737
01:17:56.529 --> 01:17:57.080
It's very good.

1738
01:17:57.129 --> 01:17:57.330
I mean,

1739
01:17:57.370 --> 01:17:58.319
I'll be very happy.

1740
01:17:59.870 --> 01:17:59.979
So then you must have a copyright.

1741
01:18:04.370 --> 01:18:05.129
Now I said then.

1742
01:18:06.600 --> 01:18:07.689
What will they do?

1743
01:18:07.770 --> 01:18:08.109
They said,

1744
01:18:08.129 --> 01:18:08.399
you see,

1745
01:18:08.410 --> 01:18:10.009
they will use your words,

1746
01:18:10.129 --> 01:18:10.640
your

1747
01:18:11.910 --> 01:18:13.290
centre as a very good idea.

1748
01:18:14.129 --> 01:18:15.569
But you know what they did?

1749
01:18:15.859 --> 01:18:18.450
They started calling themselves born again.

1750
01:18:21.390 --> 01:18:22.419
Born again,

1751
01:18:22.669 --> 01:18:24.589
you cannot call yourself anything,

1752
01:18:24.629 --> 01:18:24.950
you see,

1753
01:18:25.109 --> 01:18:26.029
it's a power,

1754
01:18:26.069 --> 01:18:27.069
it's a state.

1755
01:18:28.029 --> 01:18:29.859
It's a situation in which you have to be.

1756
01:18:29.899 --> 01:18:31.709
If you are just born again,

1757
01:18:31.819 --> 01:18:32.540
you say to yourself,

1758
01:18:32.580 --> 01:18:33.459
what is your power?

1759
01:18:35.209 --> 01:18:36.029
Born again,

1760
01:18:36.180 --> 01:18:39.020
the first power you get is that you become your

1761
01:18:39.020 --> 01:18:44.779
nerves become your brain becomes collectively conscious in your awareness.

1762
01:18:49.879 --> 01:18:51.680
That's the minimum that should happen.

1763
01:18:56.029 --> 01:18:57.439
It's not certificate.

1764
01:18:57.660 --> 01:18:58.490
It's another,

1765
01:18:58.620 --> 01:18:58.750
oh,

1766
01:18:59.259 --> 01:19:01.660
that is the latest and the anti-culturist,

1767
01:19:02.220 --> 01:19:03.609
then they might be the latest.

1768
01:19:05.379 --> 01:19:06.779
is another denomination.

1769
01:19:11.729 --> 01:19:13.250
There's no reality that

1770
01:19:13.520 --> 01:19:15.240
you don't know one of the one of the.

1771
01:19:15.919 --> 01:19:17.060
They attacked me

1772
01:19:17.470 --> 01:19:18.310
in Switzerland.

1773
01:19:19.240 --> 01:19:20.899
And the lady born again

1774
01:19:21.470 --> 01:19:23.569
was wearing all kinds of glittery things.

1775
01:19:24.259 --> 01:19:26.089
And she was bringing a Bible to hit me,

1776
01:19:26.169 --> 01:19:26.640
you know,

1777
01:19:27.049 --> 01:19:28.439
and I couldn't bear.

1778
01:19:30.140 --> 01:19:32.729
The whole joke and I started laughing

1779
01:19:33.180 --> 01:19:34.859
and everybody was very upset,

1780
01:19:34.939 --> 01:19:35.979
but I was just laughing.

1781
01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:36.310
I said,

1782
01:19:36.379 --> 01:19:37.100
What a nice thing,

1783
01:19:37.109 --> 01:19:38.660
born again coming up to me.

1784
01:19:39.640 --> 01:19:41.830
What wrong am I doing to you?

1785
01:19:44.560 --> 01:19:45.339
But you see,

1786
01:19:45.459 --> 01:19:48.540
the thing is the organised religion is such a position.

1787
01:19:49.560 --> 01:19:52.140
It's such a security for people

1788
01:19:52.589 --> 01:19:53.180
that they say,

1789
01:19:53.229 --> 01:19:53.350
oh,

1790
01:19:53.470 --> 01:19:54.149
we are born again,

1791
01:19:54.189 --> 01:19:55.069
now certified.

1792
01:19:56.060 --> 01:19:56.819
Certify

1793
01:20:00.009 --> 01:20:01.479
And they feel very secure with it,

1794
01:20:01.490 --> 01:20:01.959
I think.

1795
01:20:01.970 --> 01:20:06.669
Otherwise I can't understand why should you accept such a title you are born again.

1796
01:20:08.629 --> 01:20:10.930
Unless and until you have the power,

1797
01:20:11.060 --> 01:20:14.689
we must know what is the power one should have as a born again.

1798
01:20:14.899 --> 01:20:15.950
They have no knowledge,

1799
01:20:16.020 --> 01:20:16.379
nothing.

1800
01:20:17.740 --> 01:20:19.040
They just know Bible,

1801
01:20:20.049 --> 01:20:21.970
which also is so superficial.

1802
01:20:25.689 --> 01:20:27.709
There is no depth in their life,

1803
01:20:27.959 --> 01:20:28.399
nothing.

1804
01:20:29.930 --> 01:20:31.149
Self-certification

1805
01:20:35.509 --> 01:20:37.180
There's no certificate in such.

1806
01:20:41.720 --> 01:20:43.140
If you are born again,

1807
01:20:43.229 --> 01:20:44.430
you will know yourself.

1808
01:20:45.279 --> 01:20:46.879
And then you have to become.

1809
01:20:47.979 --> 01:20:49.879
It's a becoming that is important.

1810
01:20:51.470 --> 01:20:52.339
That's a fact.

1811
01:20:55.229 --> 01:20:57.819
Be careful about born creatures.

1812
01:20:58.490 --> 01:20:59.009
Oh,

1813
01:20:59.109 --> 01:21:00.350
we have had enough of them.

1814
01:21:01.660 --> 01:21:04.089
They felt quite challenged about Siryga because

1815
01:21:04.089 --> 01:21:06.330
everywhere we went they attacked us everywhere.

1816
01:21:07.180 --> 01:21:08.740
They tried to attack us,

1817
01:21:08.990 --> 01:21:10.270
but when we went to Australia,

1818
01:21:10.379 --> 01:21:11.149
the Australians said,

1819
01:21:11.229 --> 01:21:13.069
Now you have done enough of yours.

1820
01:21:13.790 --> 01:21:15.270
You haven't got anything from you,

1821
01:21:15.459 --> 01:21:16.180
go away.

1822
01:21:17.100 --> 01:21:18.140
So then they went away.

1823
01:21:18.830 --> 01:21:20.850
But they are so self-deceived also.

1824
01:21:20.979 --> 01:21:22.729
They live with self-deception.

1825
01:21:23.060 --> 01:21:24.620
They know they haven't got anything.

1826
01:21:29.509 --> 01:21:31.490
What have you got?

1827
01:21:35.029 --> 01:21:35.290
Alright,

1828
01:21:35.479 --> 01:21:36.209
now Gregor has said,

1829
01:21:36.250 --> 01:21:36.649
I'm this,

1830
01:21:36.729 --> 01:21:37.169
I'm that,

1831
01:21:37.330 --> 01:21:37.490
right,

1832
01:21:37.649 --> 01:21:38.450
don't believe in him.

1833
01:21:41.040 --> 01:21:43.259
You must get something out of me.

1834
01:21:52.500 --> 01:21:53.399
Another question.

1835
01:21:56.589 --> 01:21:59.970
Could you explain the difference between self-realization

1836
01:22:00.529 --> 01:22:00.879
And

1837
01:22:05.600 --> 01:22:07.029
Is that the side of me.

1838
01:22:13.660 --> 01:22:16.200
Just now let us deal with self-realization.

1839
01:22:20.990 --> 01:22:21.339
That

1840
01:22:21.790 --> 01:22:22.520
that's why

1841
01:22:22.859 --> 01:22:23.790
Buddha wanted.

1842
01:22:24.839 --> 01:22:26.439
Not to speak a word about God.

1843
01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:28.339
He never wanted to take the name of God also.

1844
01:22:28.399 --> 01:22:28.870
He said,

1845
01:22:28.959 --> 01:22:29.879
first self,

1846
01:22:30.160 --> 01:22:30.479
he said,

1847
01:22:30.640 --> 01:22:32.149
don't talk of God,

1848
01:22:32.290 --> 01:22:33.439
dangerous situation.

1849
01:22:38.819 --> 01:22:39.970
But in a search yoga,

1850
01:22:40.089 --> 01:22:41.240
this thing I'll tell you,

1851
01:22:41.569 --> 01:22:42.129
not here.

1852
01:22:43.149 --> 01:22:43.890
Because

1853
01:22:44.410 --> 01:22:45.759
people won't understand

1854
01:22:46.189 --> 01:22:47.790
when I tell them about chakras,

1855
01:22:47.870 --> 01:22:49.189
better is to keep this

1856
01:22:49.589 --> 01:22:50.140
for future,

1857
01:22:50.290 --> 01:22:50.709
all right?

1858
01:22:58.359 --> 01:23:01.229
Look at the sa now they want to have God's realisation.

1859
01:23:01.319 --> 01:23:02.109
That's good.

1860
01:23:20.479 --> 01:23:20.970
OK

1861
01:23:21.660 --> 01:23:24.589
What is the purpose of our soul in the material form?

1862
01:23:25.459 --> 01:23:26.020
Oh,

1863
01:23:27.589 --> 01:23:28.729
It's a long story

1864
01:23:34.419 --> 01:23:36.410
Human beings created the purpose.

1865
01:23:38.410 --> 01:23:39.180
In a way

1866
01:23:41.250 --> 01:23:43.589
Like a diamond lost in the mire.

1867
01:23:45.660 --> 01:23:47.240
You can say Adam and Eve.

1868
01:23:47.330 --> 01:23:48.120
It started.

1869
01:23:51.370 --> 01:23:53.990
There would have been no need to go through all this.

1870
01:23:57.049 --> 01:23:59.680
But human beings wanted to know everything.

1871
01:24:02.410 --> 01:24:04.390
They wanted to know the sting

1872
01:24:04.839 --> 01:24:06.069
of a scorpion.

1873
01:24:06.479 --> 01:24:07.560
They wanted to know.

1874
01:24:08.209 --> 01:24:10.069
The bite of a snake

1875
01:24:10.600 --> 01:24:13.009
and then they wanted to come to God.

1876
01:24:13.520 --> 01:24:13.919
All right,

1877
01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:14.959
you have your own way.

1878
01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:15.950
You have freedom.

1879
01:24:16.319 --> 01:24:17.350
That's freedom.

1880
01:24:17.600 --> 01:24:18.509
Nobody can take.

1881
01:24:19.040 --> 01:24:19.950
That's given to you.

1882
01:24:20.080 --> 01:24:20.839
Do what you like.

1883
01:24:21.970 --> 01:24:24.600
So instead of eating your food directly like this,

1884
01:24:24.629 --> 01:24:25.100
as I said,

1885
01:24:25.129 --> 01:24:26.189
they started eating.

1886
01:24:28.169 --> 01:24:29.220
What can you do?

1887
01:24:32.930 --> 01:24:33.589
That's the

1888
01:24:34.490 --> 01:24:35.939
Human doing not of God.

1889
01:24:38.379 --> 01:24:40.160
It could have been very short circuited,

1890
01:24:40.290 --> 01:24:40.600
but

1891
01:24:40.770 --> 01:24:41.560
it was so.

1892
01:24:43.319 --> 01:24:43.339
All right.

1893
01:24:47.529 --> 01:24:48.819
But that doesn't mean

1894
01:24:49.319 --> 01:24:51.200
that your body is not required.

1895
01:24:52.200 --> 01:24:54.069
Everything is required very much.

1896
01:24:59.160 --> 01:25:00.600
Because the process is such.

1897
01:25:01.370 --> 01:25:03.000
Supposing if you have a chance

1898
01:25:03.209 --> 01:25:05.459
of making a fruit in a

1899
01:25:05.810 --> 01:25:06.810
seed into a fruit,

1900
01:25:07.529 --> 01:25:08.490
just in the laboratory,

1901
01:25:08.609 --> 01:25:10.259
put the seed and it becomes the fruit.

1902
01:25:11.069 --> 01:25:11.479
All right,

1903
01:25:11.629 --> 01:25:13.359
then you don't have the whole process,

1904
01:25:13.669 --> 01:25:15.189
but if the process is this way,

1905
01:25:15.220 --> 01:25:15.910
you better have it.

1906
01:25:21.419 --> 01:25:22.020
Next

1907
01:25:23.270 --> 01:25:25.069
Next time one can try that.

1908
01:25:26.100 --> 01:25:28.089
But let's finish the process now.

1909
01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:30.589
We're coming to the end of it.

1910
01:25:31.080 --> 01:25:32.750
That's the trouble now we can't go back,

1911
01:25:32.879 --> 01:25:33.439
can we?

1912
01:25:35.020 --> 01:25:35.540
We are,

1913
01:25:35.629 --> 01:25:36.189
I mean,

1914
01:25:36.470 --> 01:25:37.209
trying to.

1915
01:25:39.850 --> 01:25:40.640
We cannot

1916
01:25:46.359 --> 01:25:46.379
All right.

1917
01:25:47.470 --> 01:25:48.810
Is there any other question

1918
01:25:49.240 --> 01:25:49.859
from Sergi we good?

1919
01:25:51.540 --> 01:25:52.609
But don't ask

1920
01:25:53.160 --> 01:25:55.049
such questions that I can't answer here.

1921
01:25:58.359 --> 01:25:58.830
Please.

1922
01:26:10.470 --> 01:26:10.750
Yes,

1923
01:26:10.839 --> 01:26:11.000
please,

1924
01:26:11.160 --> 01:26:11.709
again.

1925
01:26:14.259 --> 01:26:14.279
Huh?

1926
01:26:15.220 --> 01:26:18.490
Would it be wrong to assume the soul in this life?

1927
01:26:19.120 --> 01:26:19.160
It

1928
01:26:21.399 --> 01:26:21.759
Was it?

1929
01:26:21.839 --> 01:26:25.560
Is it wrong to assume that the soul in this life is the mind in the next life?

1930
01:26:27.799 --> 01:26:29.000
I didn't follow this.

1931
01:26:32.859 --> 01:26:34.939
Mind in this life or the next life.

1932
01:26:35.669 --> 01:26:36.020
Oh,

1933
01:26:36.140 --> 01:26:37.390
I understand now I.

1934
01:26:38.939 --> 01:26:39.200
No,

1935
01:26:39.279 --> 01:26:39.359
no,

1936
01:26:39.430 --> 01:26:39.479
no,

1937
01:26:39.580 --> 01:26:39.640
no,

1938
01:26:39.740 --> 01:26:39.839
no,

1939
01:26:39.910 --> 01:26:40.120
no.

1940
01:26:41.770 --> 01:26:41.779
See,

1941
01:26:42.450 --> 01:26:43.089
so

1942
01:26:43.770 --> 01:26:45.600
is different from spirit.

1943
01:26:46.169 --> 01:26:48.279
Spirit is the light

1944
01:26:48.729 --> 01:26:49.779
of the soul,

1945
01:26:49.970 --> 01:26:50.330
right?

1946
01:26:50.450 --> 01:26:51.529
Let's differentiate it.

1947
01:26:52.589 --> 01:26:53.589
And then

1948
01:26:54.200 --> 01:26:55.270
The soul

1949
01:26:55.629 --> 01:26:56.330
is

1950
01:26:59.020 --> 01:26:59.759
To tell him

1951
01:27:01.830 --> 01:27:04.649
All the 5 elements that are within us.

1952
01:27:06.200 --> 01:27:07.750
They form the soul

1953
01:27:08.200 --> 01:27:09.959
and the light of the soul.

1954
01:27:10.770 --> 01:27:11.660
Is

1955
01:27:12.120 --> 01:27:13.009
the spirit,

1956
01:27:13.560 --> 01:27:13.879
right?

1957
01:27:15.319 --> 01:27:15.569
No,

1958
01:27:15.669 --> 01:27:15.709
no,

1959
01:27:15.830 --> 01:27:15.910
no,

1960
01:27:16.109 --> 01:27:16.540
but

1961
01:27:16.669 --> 01:27:19.540
it doesn't transform from one to another.

1962
01:27:20.700 --> 01:27:23.680
There's no transformation between this to that,

1963
01:27:23.930 --> 01:27:24.330
all right.

1964
01:27:25.100 --> 01:27:26.879
So today's mind

1965
01:27:27.569 --> 01:27:28.709
becomes a spirit

1966
01:27:29.109 --> 01:27:30.990
next life as you are saying,

1967
01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:31.470
how,

1968
01:27:32.209 --> 01:27:34.930
because today's mind realises

1969
01:27:35.319 --> 01:27:37.560
that mind is not sufficient.

1970
01:27:38.740 --> 01:27:39.169
So

1971
01:27:39.299 --> 01:27:39.609
it

1972
01:27:40.700 --> 01:27:41.689
Assets

1973
01:27:42.600 --> 01:27:43.870
To the spirithood,

1974
01:27:44.359 --> 01:27:45.040
to the selfhood,

1975
01:27:45.339 --> 01:27:45.910
all right,

1976
01:27:46.399 --> 01:27:48.270
through the mind it.

1977
01:27:49.299 --> 01:27:50.390
Acquires

1978
01:27:51.680 --> 01:27:53.109
The understanding

1979
01:27:54.259 --> 01:27:55.379
The logic

1980
01:27:55.770 --> 01:27:57.089
that you have to accept.

1981
01:27:58.069 --> 01:28:00.229
But it doesn't come

1982
01:28:00.450 --> 01:28:02.450
out of your mind.

1983
01:28:03.080 --> 01:28:05.939
It comes out of the mind of God Almighty,

1984
01:28:06.029 --> 01:28:06.629
the Spirit.

1985
01:28:08.049 --> 01:28:09.569
Which is untarnishable.

1986
01:28:10.339 --> 01:28:11.500
Unchangeable.

1987
01:28:12.290 --> 01:28:15.169
But by following your mind,

1988
01:28:15.540 --> 01:28:17.589
you realise that mine

1989
01:28:17.859 --> 01:28:19.259
is not the last one.

1990
01:28:21.580 --> 01:28:22.660
Or same with emotions.

1991
01:28:22.819 --> 01:28:25.890
So many people who have failed in their emotional life

1992
01:28:26.500 --> 01:28:28.250
in a way are especially blessed

1993
01:28:28.779 --> 01:28:29.799
because they give up

1994
01:28:30.180 --> 01:28:32.049
that kind of a madness

1995
01:28:32.419 --> 01:28:33.569
and achieve

1996
01:28:34.379 --> 01:28:34.939
spirit.

1997
01:28:36.450 --> 01:28:37.720
But it's not the same.

1998
01:28:43.830 --> 01:28:44.979
It's very detached.

1999
01:28:45.060 --> 01:28:47.330
It's not attached to any elements.

2000
01:28:47.939 --> 01:28:50.379
Spirit is detached from all emotions.

2001
01:28:51.939 --> 01:28:53.580
It can see everything,

2002
01:28:53.810 --> 01:28:54.810
but it's detached.

2003
01:29:01.319 --> 01:29:02.629
I followed your question right,

2004
01:29:02.709 --> 01:29:03.370
isn't it?

2005
01:29:03.709 --> 01:29:03.870
Yes,

2006
01:29:03.990 --> 01:29:04.229
thank you.

2007
01:29:04.509 --> 01:29:05.310
It's a deep question.

2008
01:29:06.330 --> 01:29:07.279
You understood it.

2009
01:29:09.399 --> 01:29:11.029
You got your answer right.

2010
01:29:11.779 --> 01:29:11.839
I,

2011
01:29:12.439 --> 01:29:12.959
I'm happy.

2012
01:29:16.149 --> 01:29:17.359
It's a good question,

2013
01:29:17.890 --> 01:29:19.120
but it was rather

2014
01:29:20.060 --> 01:29:22.580
abridged form of a question,

2015
01:29:22.799 --> 01:29:24.160
but I managed it somehow.

2016
01:29:26.330 --> 01:29:27.640
Now I'm happy because sometimes,

2017
01:29:27.689 --> 01:29:28.049
you know.

2018
01:29:30.060 --> 01:29:31.939
You people are so alert that

2019
01:29:32.049 --> 01:29:34.120
you ask very nice questions.

2020
01:29:35.759 --> 01:29:36.109
But

2021
01:29:38.549 --> 01:29:39.910
I'm not so intelligent,

2022
01:29:39.990 --> 01:29:41.189
I must confess.

2023
01:29:46.359 --> 01:29:49.069
As you people are because I don't use my mind at all.

2024
01:29:56.390 --> 01:29:56.399
Uh,

2025
01:29:56.979 --> 01:29:58.140
but you can reach.

2026
01:30:00.899 --> 01:30:02.640
The point very easily.

2027
01:30:03.830 --> 01:30:06.330
If you have your spirit intact because it's light.

2028
01:30:08.029 --> 01:30:08.850
Intelligence,

2029
01:30:08.859 --> 01:30:10.479
if it is pure intelligence,

2030
01:30:10.529 --> 01:30:11.129
what you call.

2031
01:30:11.830 --> 01:30:13.500
That's the intelligence of the spirit.

2032
01:30:13.580 --> 01:30:15.259
You just reached the point exactly.

2033
01:30:19.209 --> 01:30:22.029
But the intelligence that we understand is very different,

2034
01:30:22.089 --> 01:30:22.350
you see,

2035
01:30:22.359 --> 01:30:22.930
it's,

2036
01:30:23.479 --> 01:30:24.839
it plays with the words.

2037
01:30:24.919 --> 01:30:26.180
It baffles you.

2038
01:30:26.509 --> 01:30:27.490
It's brilliant.

2039
01:30:28.180 --> 01:30:30.089
The eyes can get completely.

2040
01:30:31.310 --> 01:30:31.870
Shut

2041
01:30:32.169 --> 01:30:32.790
with that.

2042
01:30:35.600 --> 01:30:36.390
Was that

2043
01:30:36.569 --> 01:30:37.870
pure intelligence.

2044
01:30:39.459 --> 01:30:41.160
Pure intelligence just

2045
01:30:41.970 --> 01:30:43.799
Gives you the absolute.

2046
01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:51.359
essence of everything.

2047
01:30:58.479 --> 01:30:59.770
That's the intelligence.

2048
01:31:01.120 --> 01:31:02.439
Of the spirit,

2049
01:31:02.870 --> 01:31:03.830
not of the mind.

2050
01:31:16.990 --> 01:31:17.750
Any other question,

2051
01:31:17.830 --> 01:31:18.220
please?

2052
01:31:31.709 --> 01:31:31.729
Hugo,

2053
01:31:33.060 --> 01:31:33.500
is he there?

2054
01:31:34.339 --> 01:31:35.839
Any German question?

2055
01:31:41.040 --> 01:31:41.060
Anyway,

2056
01:31:42.220 --> 01:31:44.189
we also have denominations are there.

2057
01:31:48.020 --> 01:31:49.620
Let us be in a very pleasant mood.

2058
01:31:49.660 --> 01:31:52.149
I'm trying to bring you to a pleasant mood.

2059
01:31:52.379 --> 01:31:53.970
Please be in a pleasant mood.

2060
01:31:54.339 --> 01:31:54.660
And now,

2061
01:31:54.700 --> 01:31:55.649
is there any question?

2062
01:32:02.399 --> 01:32:02.410
So.

2063
01:32:05.870 --> 01:32:06.089
Saga.

2064
01:32:11.290 --> 01:32:11.339
Because you don't.

2065
01:32:17.459 --> 01:32:17.709
Yes,

2066
01:32:17.830 --> 01:32:18.240
madam.

2067
01:32:19.520 --> 01:32:19.529
I

2068
01:32:24.990 --> 01:32:25.720
But she's

2069
01:32:32.589 --> 01:32:33.899
The question between Matahi

2070
01:32:34.470 --> 01:32:36.620
is your German question which you asked for.

2071
01:32:42.350 --> 01:32:45.549
How did I know there's a German lurking somewhere.

2072
01:32:48.609 --> 01:32:49.330
Now explain,

2073
01:32:49.390 --> 01:32:49.979
what does she say?

2074
01:32:50.160 --> 01:32:50.229
Why?

2075
01:32:51.979 --> 01:32:52.200
Why?

2076
01:32:53.939 --> 01:32:55.560
Because God wanted you to be here.

2077
01:33:01.220 --> 01:33:01.229
Yeah.

2078
01:33:11.229 --> 01:33:11.750
Like you said,

2079
01:33:11.910 --> 01:33:13.259
there must be a reason,

2080
01:33:13.549 --> 01:33:14.339
of course.

2081
01:33:14.669 --> 01:33:15.819
The reason is

2082
01:33:16.899 --> 01:33:18.810
is the reflection of God's will.

2083
01:33:21.500 --> 01:33:23.000
That he wanted us to be here.

2084
01:33:24.899 --> 01:33:28.649
It's not according to our reasoning that God moves.

2085
01:33:28.810 --> 01:33:30.129
He has his own reasons.

2086
01:33:31.240 --> 01:33:32.700
That he wanted to have something,

2087
01:33:32.870 --> 01:33:33.709
so he has it.

2088
01:33:35.299 --> 01:33:36.810
He wants to have his children.

2089
01:33:37.660 --> 01:33:38.879
Why do you have a child?

2090
01:33:39.700 --> 01:33:41.049
Because you want to have.

2091
01:33:42.649 --> 01:33:44.430
I want to enjoy and cherish.

2092
01:33:45.709 --> 01:33:47.129
That's what God wanted

2093
01:33:47.379 --> 01:33:49.720
to enjoy and cherish the love

2094
01:33:50.220 --> 01:33:52.490
of his children as the child loves you,

2095
01:33:52.660 --> 01:33:53.089
you see,

2096
01:33:53.160 --> 01:33:54.419
the answer is yes.

2097
01:34:08.390 --> 01:34:08.859
See?

2098
01:34:11.359 --> 01:34:14.390
He is a realised soul and he's clearing her.

2099
01:34:15.910 --> 01:34:15.930
Jack

2100
01:34:19.060 --> 01:34:21.069
So my intelligence is with him.

2101
01:34:21.430 --> 01:34:21.950
Correct.

2102
01:34:22.600 --> 01:34:24.680
He's clearly clearing your this chakra.

2103
01:34:26.180 --> 01:34:27.890
And he understands.

2104
01:34:29.419 --> 01:34:30.640
But this is the real I saw.

2105
01:34:41.669 --> 01:34:41.799
We

2106
01:34:44.890 --> 01:34:45.870
Which just put up your hand.

2107
01:34:45.990 --> 01:34:46.899
I can't see you.

2108
01:34:48.830 --> 01:34:50.729
They're asking for their self-realization.

2109
01:34:51.189 --> 01:34:52.189
That's great.

2110
01:34:53.879 --> 01:34:54.919
That's your right.

2111
01:34:56.589 --> 01:34:57.290
That's very,

2112
01:34:57.310 --> 01:34:57.970
very great.

2113
01:35:01.759 --> 01:35:02.040
All right,

2114
01:35:02.160 --> 01:35:02.799
let's have

2115
01:35:08.729 --> 01:35:10.879
But all the 20 who are here.

2116
01:35:13.310 --> 01:35:15.069
I have to make a humble request.

2117
01:35:16.240 --> 01:35:19.390
That please respect your realisation.

2118
01:35:20.649 --> 01:35:21.120
Please.

2119
01:35:24.540 --> 01:35:25.850
Sometimes I weep

2120
01:35:26.419 --> 01:35:27.299
with frustration.

2121
01:35:31.970 --> 01:35:33.120
And I request you

2122
01:35:34.459 --> 01:35:36.959
To understand your value and worth

2123
01:35:37.209 --> 01:35:38.620
in the light of the spirit.

2124
01:35:40.640 --> 01:35:41.080
Thank you.

2125
01:35:42.950 --> 01:35:45.709
Could you please take out your shoes and sit with

2126
01:35:45.709 --> 01:35:48.910
your 2 ft on the ground without crossing the legs?

2127
01:35:50.890 --> 01:35:51.600
And

2128
01:35:53.140 --> 01:35:54.129
Be comfortable.

2129
01:35:54.220 --> 01:35:57.149
Don't have anything which makes you feel tired and put.

2130
01:35:57.930 --> 01:35:59.319
Your two hands

2131
01:35:59.810 --> 01:36:03.770
in the direction of Srima Taji with the poems upwards.

2132
01:36:03.850 --> 01:36:04.209
Thank you.

2133
01:36:05.310 --> 01:36:08.029
But the new people should come forward and the surgeon must give

2134
01:36:08.029 --> 01:36:10.290
them room because you see we have to look after that.

2135
01:36:10.910 --> 01:36:13.339
So please all the people

2136
01:36:13.589 --> 01:36:16.220
who are here for the first time,

2137
01:36:20.299 --> 01:36:21.109
would you please come forward on the forward

2138
01:36:21.109 --> 01:36:23.310
seat and every Sajogi on the forward seat,

2139
01:36:23.350 --> 01:36:23.700
please.

2140
01:36:23.810 --> 01:36:24.779
The first seat,

2141
01:36:25.080 --> 01:36:26.379
please move backwards.

2142
01:36:27.229 --> 01:36:28.100
And

2143
01:36:28.259 --> 01:36:29.910
we are speaking about the seats,

2144
01:36:29.979 --> 01:36:30.970
not on the ground,

2145
01:36:31.220 --> 01:36:32.529
so all the new people,

2146
01:36:32.660 --> 01:36:35.299
please sit on the first row of seats.

2147
01:36:37.009 --> 01:36:37.049
Um

2148
01:36:39.310 --> 01:36:40.140
That's great.

2149
01:36:42.209 --> 01:36:44.649
She's going to start a centre in Wimbledon.

2150
01:36:47.689 --> 01:36:48.129
Let's see.

2151
01:36:50.439 --> 01:36:51.509
Hope for the best.

2152
01:36:51.720 --> 01:36:53.390
Keep your fingers crossed.

2153
01:36:57.069 --> 01:36:57.990
Such vibracious

2154
01:36:59.270 --> 01:37:02.779
it's better to be there but they go into cramps.

2155
01:37:04.069 --> 01:37:04.229
Oh,

2156
01:37:04.310 --> 01:37:05.149
if this is not enough,

2157
01:37:05.189 --> 01:37:06.270
also on the 2nd row,

2158
01:37:06.310 --> 01:37:06.490
please,

2159
01:37:06.629 --> 01:37:06.819
uh,

2160
01:37:06.839 --> 01:37:07.310
Jayogis,

2161
01:37:07.390 --> 01:37:08.859
can you leave the 2nd row free?

2162
01:37:11.229 --> 01:37:12.430
Such vibration boy,

2163
01:37:12.470 --> 01:37:14.310
you don't know his idea of a builder.

2164
01:37:15.520 --> 01:37:16.680
Different is vibration.

2165
01:37:16.970 --> 01:37:20.120
It's too much vibrations.

2166
01:37:20.359 --> 01:37:20.520
Yeah,

2167
01:37:20.620 --> 01:37:21.200
it's good.

2168
01:37:25.919 --> 01:37:28.229
Sir Jogi should move from the 2nd row

2169
01:37:28.439 --> 01:37:30.709
and let people who are

2170
01:37:30.919 --> 01:37:32.009
new should sit there.

2171
01:37:32.120 --> 01:37:34.910
Please move from the 2nd and the 1st row also,

2172
01:37:35.080 --> 01:37:35.439
I mean.

2173
01:37:55.319 --> 01:37:55.479
Please,

2174
01:37:55.540 --> 01:37:56.470
can you just,

2175
01:37:56.759 --> 01:37:57.410
as I said,

2176
01:37:57.479 --> 01:38:02.310
put your 2 ft on the ground straight without crossing the legs and put

2177
01:38:02.310 --> 01:38:05.330
your two hands with the palm upwards in the direction of Shri Mata.

2178
01:38:05.520 --> 01:38:07.029
If you are sitting on the ground,

2179
01:38:07.080 --> 01:38:10.069
there's nothing to worry about the feet being on the ground,

2180
01:38:10.319 --> 01:38:11.470
then you are on the ground.

2181
01:38:11.520 --> 01:38:13.359
But those who are sitting on the chair,

2182
01:38:13.479 --> 01:38:14.910
please put both your

2183
01:38:15.399 --> 01:38:15.970
feet.

2184
01:38:16.680 --> 01:38:20.390
Like this on the mother because she sucks in the problems you have.

2185
01:38:20.950 --> 01:38:23.109
I put both hands like this towards me.

2186
01:38:39.339 --> 01:38:41.640
Now you have to close your eyes.

2187
01:38:41.799 --> 01:38:42.919
Just close your eyes.

2188
01:38:54.180 --> 01:38:56.479
You don't open your eyes

2189
01:38:56.839 --> 01:38:58.640
till I tell you

2190
01:38:58.850 --> 01:39:00.319
to open your eyes,

2191
01:39:00.609 --> 01:39:02.770
so you just keep your eyes shut.

2192
01:39:08.779 --> 01:39:10.299
Now left hand

2193
01:39:10.580 --> 01:39:13.029
is symbolic of our

2194
01:39:13.379 --> 01:39:14.089
desire.

2195
01:39:15.299 --> 01:39:16.680
Desire power.

2196
01:39:17.209 --> 01:39:18.799
So we are putting our desire

2197
01:39:19.009 --> 01:39:19.609
left hand.

2198
01:39:22.020 --> 01:39:22.759
Asking

2199
01:39:24.140 --> 01:39:25.830
For our self-realization,

2200
01:39:26.160 --> 01:39:27.520
so keep it all the time.

2201
01:39:28.410 --> 01:39:29.759
The left hand towards me.

2202
01:39:30.959 --> 01:39:31.959
Right hand

2203
01:39:32.240 --> 01:39:34.479
is the power of action.

2204
01:39:35.169 --> 01:39:35.700
Grea

2205
01:39:36.850 --> 01:39:39.120
So you have to use the right hand

2206
01:39:39.549 --> 01:39:40.229
for that.

2207
01:39:41.140 --> 01:39:42.540
And so

2208
01:39:43.540 --> 01:39:45.160
You have to put your right hand.

2209
01:39:46.700 --> 01:39:48.600
On to different centres

2210
01:39:48.910 --> 01:39:50.350
which I will explain to you.

2211
01:39:51.299 --> 01:39:52.970
Very in a very simple way.

2212
01:39:53.689 --> 01:39:58.069
And you'll be able to understand that you have to put your hand on these centres

2213
01:39:58.799 --> 01:40:00.649
helping your kundalini to rise.

2214
01:40:02.540 --> 01:40:02.549
Now,

2215
01:40:05.299 --> 01:40:09.770
We are working out only on the left hand side of our centres

2216
01:40:10.049 --> 01:40:11.049
with our right hand.

2217
01:40:11.700 --> 01:40:13.649
So the left hand is towards me.

2218
01:40:14.439 --> 01:40:18.540
And the right hand goes on to different centres that we have

2219
01:40:18.910 --> 01:40:19.850
as simple as that.

2220
01:40:20.430 --> 01:40:21.350
The first one.

2221
01:40:22.069 --> 01:40:23.020
Is the one

2222
01:40:25.200 --> 01:40:27.669
What we call is the seat of the spirit,

2223
01:40:27.750 --> 01:40:28.899
which is the heart,

2224
01:40:29.509 --> 01:40:30.910
which is on the left hand side.

2225
01:40:31.660 --> 01:40:33.200
So please put

2226
01:40:33.609 --> 01:40:35.290
your left hand towards me.

2227
01:40:36.540 --> 01:40:37.689
All the time

2228
01:40:37.939 --> 01:40:40.049
and the right hand on the heart.

2229
01:40:43.229 --> 01:40:43.779
Now

2230
01:40:43.990 --> 01:40:45.069
just on the heart.

2231
01:40:48.290 --> 01:40:50.040
Now at this place.

2232
01:40:51.540 --> 01:40:52.689
You have to

2233
01:40:54.450 --> 01:40:57.379
Ask me a very fundamental question.

2234
01:41:00.600 --> 01:41:01.149
Mother

2235
01:41:02.109 --> 01:41:03.990
If you call me Shri Mataji,

2236
01:41:04.100 --> 01:41:05.229
her mother is the same.

2237
01:41:06.299 --> 01:41:06.790
Mother

2238
01:41:09.270 --> 01:41:10.850
Am I the spirit?

2239
01:41:11.399 --> 01:41:13.370
The fundamental question just asked me,

2240
01:41:13.700 --> 01:41:14.209
Mother,

2241
01:41:14.419 --> 01:41:15.669
am I the spirit?

2242
01:41:22.549 --> 01:41:24.509
Ask this question 3 times,

2243
01:41:24.990 --> 01:41:25.299
Mother,

2244
01:41:25.470 --> 01:41:26.589
am I the spirit?

2245
01:41:41.500 --> 01:41:42.069
So

2246
01:41:43.029 --> 01:41:45.819
One has to know that if you become the spirit,

2247
01:41:46.189 --> 01:41:47.879
you become your own guide.

2248
01:41:48.189 --> 01:41:49.919
You become your own guru.

2249
01:41:50.029 --> 01:41:53.540
This is all created by the great prophets and great gurus within you,

2250
01:41:53.660 --> 01:41:54.509
the possibility.

2251
01:41:55.950 --> 01:41:56.819
So now

2252
01:41:57.029 --> 01:41:59.379
after this you take down your right hand.

2253
01:42:00.439 --> 01:42:01.759
Onto your stomach

2254
01:42:02.169 --> 01:42:03.209
on the left hand side.

2255
01:42:06.009 --> 01:42:07.060
This is the centre

2256
01:42:08.450 --> 01:42:09.479
Of a mastery

2257
01:42:11.709 --> 01:42:12.669
Mastery

2258
01:42:14.609 --> 01:42:16.109
Of the divine power.

2259
01:42:18.049 --> 01:42:19.209
The technique

2260
01:42:19.799 --> 01:42:20.790
how to use it.

2261
01:42:24.120 --> 01:42:28.229
So here you have to ask another question relevant with the first one.

2262
01:42:29.140 --> 01:42:31.020
That if I am the spirit,

2263
01:42:31.250 --> 01:42:32.959
am I my own master?

2264
01:42:33.169 --> 01:42:34.839
Ask a question now 3 times.

2265
01:42:35.049 --> 01:42:35.290
Mother,

2266
01:42:35.350 --> 01:42:36.959
am I my own master?

2267
01:42:37.250 --> 01:42:39.450
Put your left hand towards me and right hand.

2268
01:42:40.520 --> 01:42:41.350
On the

2269
01:42:42.509 --> 01:42:46.060
Left hand side of your stomach in the upper part.

2270
01:42:49.899 --> 01:42:51.540
In the upper part

2271
01:42:51.939 --> 01:42:54.750
of your stomach on the left hand side,

2272
01:42:55.299 --> 01:42:57.930
please put your right hand and press it,

2273
01:42:58.259 --> 01:43:01.569
and here you ask me a question three times,

2274
01:43:01.899 --> 01:43:02.419
Mother.

2275
01:43:06.680 --> 01:43:07.149
My

2276
01:43:07.279 --> 01:43:08.509
own master.

2277
01:43:09.290 --> 01:43:11.359
Am I my own guide?

2278
01:43:12.140 --> 01:43:14.319
Am I my own guru?

2279
01:43:14.689 --> 01:43:16.479
This is the blessings of the real.

2280
01:43:17.459 --> 01:43:18.479
Sadgurus

2281
01:43:23.410 --> 01:43:23.700
Mm

2282
01:43:32.359 --> 01:43:33.149
3 times

2283
01:43:41.319 --> 01:43:41.830
Now,

2284
01:43:44.310 --> 01:43:47.680
Please take your hand in the lower part of your abdomen

2285
01:43:47.990 --> 01:43:49.259
on the left hand side.

2286
01:43:51.950 --> 01:43:53.029
Now press it hard.

2287
01:43:57.569 --> 01:43:59.040
This is the centre

2288
01:43:59.529 --> 01:44:00.919
that works out.

2289
01:44:01.129 --> 01:44:02.759
First one was the master.

2290
01:44:03.129 --> 01:44:05.250
This is the centre that works out.

2291
01:44:08.580 --> 01:44:10.560
The divine technique.

2292
01:44:12.560 --> 01:44:14.020
Of the true knowledge.

2293
01:44:16.149 --> 01:44:17.890
Of the pure knowledge.

2294
01:44:19.189 --> 01:44:20.830
So now ask a question.

2295
01:44:24.919 --> 01:44:27.899
In a way it's not a question but a request.

2296
01:44:29.649 --> 01:44:30.279
Because

2297
01:44:30.609 --> 01:44:32.680
unless and until you ask for it.

2298
01:44:33.370 --> 01:44:34.509
I cannot do it.

2299
01:44:35.459 --> 01:44:37.200
I cannot cross your freedom,

2300
01:44:37.689 --> 01:44:38.899
so here you say.

2301
01:44:39.569 --> 01:44:40.200
Mother,

2302
01:44:40.569 --> 01:44:43.040
please may I have the pure knowledge?

2303
01:44:46.589 --> 01:44:46.910
Mother,

2304
01:44:47.029 --> 01:44:49.069
may I have the pure knowledge?

2305
01:44:51.299 --> 01:44:52.270
Say it 3 times.

2306
01:44:53.459 --> 01:44:53.779
Mother,

2307
01:44:53.899 --> 01:44:55.750
may I have the pure knowledge?

2308
01:44:57.279 --> 01:44:58.149
6 times

2309
01:44:59.319 --> 01:45:01.799
Because this centre has got 6 petals.

2310
01:45:04.189 --> 01:45:05.529
Now this you are asking.

2311
01:45:06.810 --> 01:45:08.419
To initiate the kundalini.

2312
01:45:09.180 --> 01:45:14.560
To awaken the kundalini when you ask for it because it's such an absolute question,

2313
01:45:14.890 --> 01:45:16.339
the Kundalini awakens.

2314
01:45:17.069 --> 01:45:18.259
You have to request her.

2315
01:45:31.529 --> 01:45:31.990
No

2316
01:45:42.930 --> 01:45:43.649
Again,

2317
01:45:43.910 --> 01:45:44.779
raise your hand.

2318
01:45:46.410 --> 01:45:47.399
To the upper

2319
01:45:47.950 --> 01:45:48.660
portion.

2320
01:45:50.419 --> 01:45:52.240
Or upper area

2321
01:45:52.410 --> 01:45:53.419
of the stomach.

2322
01:45:55.479 --> 01:45:56.910
On the left hand side.

2323
01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.160
At the centre of the mastery.

2324
01:46:01.899 --> 01:46:03.169
Here you press it hard.

2325
01:46:04.609 --> 01:46:05.419
And say

2326
01:46:06.859 --> 01:46:09.640
With full confidence for the Kundalini to rise.

2327
01:46:10.319 --> 01:46:11.660
To open the centre

2328
01:46:11.830 --> 01:46:12.910
with full assertion.

2329
01:46:14.009 --> 01:46:14.370
Mother,

2330
01:46:14.490 --> 01:46:16.450
I am my own master.

2331
01:46:22.299 --> 01:46:22.669
Mother,

2332
01:46:22.839 --> 01:46:25.069
I am my own master.

2333
01:46:37.620 --> 01:46:39.509
You have to say this 10 times.

2334
01:46:40.370 --> 01:46:42.680
Because there are 10 masters within us

2335
01:46:42.890 --> 01:46:46.250
who have built up over 10 centres of plexuses.

2336
01:46:48.279 --> 01:46:49.930
Of this solar taxis.

2337
01:46:51.520 --> 01:46:53.540
So we have to say 10 times

2338
01:46:54.149 --> 01:46:55.379
with full assertion,

2339
01:46:55.549 --> 01:46:55.879
Mother,

2340
01:46:56.069 --> 01:46:58.270
I am my own master.

2341
01:47:31.290 --> 01:47:31.939
Now

2342
01:47:32.779 --> 01:47:32.790
there.

2343
01:47:34.180 --> 01:47:35.379
Your right hand

2344
01:47:35.830 --> 01:47:36.370
on

2345
01:47:37.240 --> 01:47:38.100
To the heart

2346
01:47:42.189 --> 01:47:43.290
Here again

2347
01:47:43.750 --> 01:47:46.020
with full confidence within yourself

2348
01:47:46.790 --> 01:47:48.189
forgetting all your past.

2349
01:47:49.459 --> 01:47:51.180
Forgetting all your problems.

2350
01:47:51.850 --> 01:47:52.589
It's full

2351
01:47:53.390 --> 01:47:55.919
confidence and assertion

2352
01:47:56.020 --> 01:47:56.899
you have to say.

2353
01:47:58.100 --> 01:47:58.500
Mother,

2354
01:47:58.680 --> 01:48:00.399
I am the spirit.

2355
01:48:01.319 --> 01:48:02.790
You have to say it 12 times.

2356
01:48:03.509 --> 01:48:03.850
Mother,

2357
01:48:04.009 --> 01:48:05.390
I am the spirit.

2358
01:48:05.450 --> 01:48:06.490
You are the spirit,

2359
01:48:06.689 --> 01:48:07.490
no doubt about it.

2360
01:48:19.870 --> 01:48:20.870
Believe in yourself.

2361
01:48:20.979 --> 01:48:21.979
Have faith in yourself.

2362
01:48:23.600 --> 01:48:26.680
Know that you are the spirit and nothing else.

2363
01:49:24.509 --> 01:49:24.520
Now,

2364
01:49:26.759 --> 01:49:28.120
Raise your right hand.

2365
01:49:28.740 --> 01:49:30.080
In the corner

2366
01:49:30.569 --> 01:49:31.600
of your left.

2367
01:49:32.640 --> 01:49:33.520
Shoulder

2368
01:49:33.879 --> 01:49:35.029
and your neck.

2369
01:49:37.080 --> 01:49:38.089
From the front

2370
01:49:40.200 --> 01:49:41.220
This is the

2371
01:49:42.060 --> 01:49:43.549
Most difficult centre

2372
01:49:43.899 --> 01:49:45.220
that we have in the West.

2373
01:49:46.100 --> 01:49:49.029
Because people believe in something

2374
01:49:49.299 --> 01:49:50.180
called the guilt.

2375
01:49:51.029 --> 01:49:52.250
And all the time

2376
01:49:52.580 --> 01:49:54.299
they feel guilty for nothing at all.

2377
01:49:56.359 --> 01:49:58.069
So put it in the corner.

2378
01:50:00.270 --> 01:50:01.319
Of the neck

2379
01:50:04.740 --> 01:50:05.919
And the shoulder

2380
01:50:06.399 --> 01:50:07.479
press it hard

2381
01:50:07.850 --> 01:50:08.770
on the back bone.

2382
01:50:13.709 --> 01:50:14.220
Hard

2383
01:50:16.779 --> 01:50:19.240
This is the worst centre we have in the West

2384
01:50:19.810 --> 01:50:21.810
that we feel guilty for nothing at all.

2385
01:50:23.209 --> 01:50:24.830
What is a feeling guilty.

2386
01:50:25.200 --> 01:50:26.509
You are the spirit.

2387
01:50:26.759 --> 01:50:28.560
How can spirit make mistakes

2388
01:50:28.919 --> 01:50:29.680
and God?

2389
01:50:31.350 --> 01:50:33.169
Is the ocean of

2390
01:50:33.580 --> 01:50:34.770
love and compassion,

2391
01:50:35.020 --> 01:50:36.060
but above all,

2392
01:50:36.779 --> 01:50:39.180
He's the ocean of forgiveness.

2393
01:50:39.479 --> 01:50:40.709
What guilt can you have?

2394
01:50:43.029 --> 01:50:44.990
What mistakes can you commit

2395
01:50:45.580 --> 01:50:47.899
that is power of forgiveness cannot forgive?

2396
01:50:51.439 --> 01:50:52.939
You are not to be guilty.

2397
01:50:53.189 --> 01:50:54.149
Forget my lecture.

2398
01:50:54.339 --> 01:50:56.270
Forget everything you are.

2399
01:50:58.169 --> 01:50:59.379
The fuel

2400
01:51:01.180 --> 01:51:02.609
Immaculate spirit.

2401
01:51:13.390 --> 01:51:15.069
You are Schan.

2402
01:51:18.810 --> 01:51:21.240
You are the source of all that is joy.

2403
01:51:48.140 --> 01:51:48.589
But

2404
01:51:49.770 --> 01:51:52.140
You have to say this 16 times,

2405
01:51:52.569 --> 01:51:53.310
Mother,

2406
01:51:53.560 --> 01:51:55.189
I am not guilty.

2407
01:51:55.359 --> 01:51:56.490
16 times,

2408
01:51:56.529 --> 01:51:59.629
press it hard and say it 16 times.

2409
01:52:24.540 --> 01:52:24.810
Hm.

2410
01:52:26.450 --> 01:52:27.709
So in the beginning it was terrible.

2411
01:52:52.850 --> 01:52:53.240
Now,

2412
01:52:55.890 --> 01:52:56.740
Take his hand.

2413
01:52:58.770 --> 01:53:00.600
Put it across your forehead,

2414
01:53:00.720 --> 01:53:01.109
please.

2415
01:53:02.640 --> 01:53:04.339
Stretch your left hand towards me

2416
01:53:04.759 --> 01:53:05.680
at this point.

2417
01:53:08.310 --> 01:53:09.589
Not how many times?

2418
01:53:10.950 --> 01:53:13.270
But from your heart you have to say.

2419
01:53:15.290 --> 01:53:16.000
Mother,

2420
01:53:16.330 --> 01:53:18.330
I forgive everyone.

2421
01:53:20.020 --> 01:53:22.120
Something that's very difficult to forgive.

2422
01:53:23.459 --> 01:53:24.250
We submit

2423
01:53:26.569 --> 01:53:28.680
Because whether you forgive or not forgive,

2424
01:53:28.689 --> 01:53:30.410
you don't do anything about it.

2425
01:53:31.479 --> 01:53:32.709
But if you don't forgive,

2426
01:53:32.750 --> 01:53:34.180
then you play into the

2427
01:53:34.430 --> 01:53:35.270
wrong hands.

2428
01:53:36.080 --> 01:53:36.990
So please say,

2429
01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:37.229
mother,

2430
01:53:37.270 --> 01:53:37.959
I forgive.

2431
01:53:39.529 --> 01:53:41.430
That's the greatest weapon you have,

2432
01:53:41.879 --> 01:53:42.390
mother,

2433
01:53:42.520 --> 01:53:43.279
I forgave.

2434
01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:52.020
Everyone

2435
01:53:53.229 --> 01:53:54.020
First of all,

2436
01:53:54.029 --> 01:53:54.419
yourself.

2437
01:54:12.350 --> 01:54:13.759
Now on the back of your head.

2438
01:54:16.259 --> 01:54:17.140
Hold it tight

2439
01:54:17.959 --> 01:54:20.790
Now for your own consolation you can say that.

2440
01:54:23.970 --> 01:54:25.450
Oh God Almighty.

2441
01:54:26.419 --> 01:54:27.129
Or

2442
01:54:27.540 --> 01:54:28.339
my Kundalini,

2443
01:54:28.370 --> 01:54:28.850
the mother.

2444
01:54:29.560 --> 01:54:31.240
If I have done anything wrong.

2445
01:54:32.319 --> 01:54:33.580
In your glory,

2446
01:54:33.910 --> 01:54:34.779
in your name,

2447
01:54:35.350 --> 01:54:36.279
please forgive me.

2448
01:54:46.669 --> 01:54:48.100
Not to feel guilty at all.

2449
01:54:48.350 --> 01:54:49.899
Please don't feel guilty,

2450
01:54:50.149 --> 01:54:51.040
but just say it out.

2451
01:54:51.149 --> 01:54:52.020
Don't count.

2452
01:54:52.819 --> 01:54:54.680
All your so-called sins,

2453
01:54:54.689 --> 01:54:55.629
just forget it,

2454
01:54:55.899 --> 01:54:56.399
forget it,

2455
01:54:56.569 --> 01:54:57.049
forget it.

2456
01:54:58.319 --> 01:54:58.529
Mm,

2457
01:54:58.680 --> 01:54:59.100
love it.

2458
01:55:00.120 --> 01:55:00.600
Now

2459
01:55:02.959 --> 01:55:05.240
Raise your hand on top of your head.

2460
01:55:06.080 --> 01:55:08.100
On the fontanel bone area.

2461
01:55:09.080 --> 01:55:10.790
Stretch your palm

2462
01:55:11.040 --> 01:55:12.589
and press it hard

2463
01:55:12.879 --> 01:55:14.240
in a clockwise manner.

2464
01:55:15.450 --> 01:55:16.819
Take your right hand

2465
01:55:17.009 --> 01:55:18.500
on top of your head,

2466
01:55:18.839 --> 01:55:20.680
on the fontanel bone area.

2467
01:55:21.459 --> 01:55:24.089
Which was a soft bone in your childhood.

2468
01:55:24.919 --> 01:55:26.060
Press it hard

2469
01:55:27.089 --> 01:55:27.680
And

2470
01:55:29.229 --> 01:55:29.870
Here

2471
01:55:30.430 --> 01:55:33.459
in a clockwise manner when you move it,

2472
01:55:33.859 --> 01:55:36.299
you have to say something.

2473
01:55:38.069 --> 01:55:39.509
Which I cannot.

2474
01:55:40.359 --> 01:55:43.620
Do it without it because you are free.

2475
01:55:44.450 --> 01:55:45.819
So you have to say,

2476
01:55:45.899 --> 01:55:46.140
Mother,

2477
01:55:46.180 --> 01:55:47.959
I want my realisation.

2478
01:55:48.299 --> 01:55:49.799
I cannot force on you.

2479
01:55:50.020 --> 01:55:51.910
So to say I want my realisation,

2480
01:55:52.060 --> 01:55:52.379
brother,

2481
01:55:52.620 --> 01:55:54.810
please give me my self-realization.

2482
01:55:55.020 --> 01:55:55.770
Just say that,

2483
01:55:55.899 --> 01:55:56.620
press it hard,

2484
01:55:56.859 --> 01:55:57.740
press it hard.

2485
01:55:59.229 --> 01:56:03.709
Stretch your palm on top of Font Nimbo area now 7 times.

2486
01:56:57.899 --> 01:56:59.779
Now bring down your right hand,

2487
01:56:59.859 --> 01:57:00.169
please.

2488
01:57:01.819 --> 01:57:03.180
The most

2489
01:57:03.509 --> 01:57:05.310
valuable moment of your life.

2490
01:57:05.939 --> 01:57:06.959
And the most

2491
01:57:08.069 --> 01:57:09.000
Precious

2492
01:57:10.069 --> 01:57:11.109
Important

2493
01:57:12.189 --> 01:57:12.779
Happily

2494
01:57:14.359 --> 01:57:18.350
Now please press your right hand towards me and left hand

2495
01:57:18.560 --> 01:57:22.439
on top of your head bending the head about say

2496
01:57:23.040 --> 01:57:25.549
34 inches and move the hand

2497
01:57:25.720 --> 01:57:30.149
and see if there's any cool breeze coming out of your own head,

2498
01:57:30.439 --> 01:57:31.040
please.

2499
01:57:35.740 --> 01:57:39.220
It was really nice to have this seminar organised here

2500
01:57:39.609 --> 01:57:41.160
at such a short notice.

2501
01:57:41.819 --> 01:57:42.419
With

2502
01:57:42.689 --> 01:57:43.959
no proper

2503
01:57:44.560 --> 01:57:45.810
Planning or anything.

2504
01:57:46.660 --> 01:57:48.839
And you've got such a nice place also

2505
01:57:49.370 --> 01:57:51.410
spontaneously the whole thing has worked out.

2506
01:57:53.479 --> 01:57:55.390
And everything is vanished.

2507
01:57:57.120 --> 01:57:57.859
But

2508
01:57:58.979 --> 01:58:00.700
Today you saw the new people who came.

2509
01:58:02.640 --> 01:58:03.129
Well

2510
01:58:04.459 --> 01:58:05.350
An example

2511
01:58:07.200 --> 01:58:07.709
Of

2512
01:58:08.640 --> 01:58:11.859
The dearth of seeking in this country or maybe

2513
01:58:14.290 --> 01:58:15.669
There is some sort of

2514
01:58:16.890 --> 01:58:18.209
Of lacking

2515
01:58:18.479 --> 01:58:19.669
on the part of English is also.

2516
01:58:22.930 --> 01:58:23.810
The way that

2517
01:58:25.540 --> 01:58:26.479
Because I'm here

2518
01:58:27.319 --> 01:58:29.029
People take things for granted.

2519
01:58:30.060 --> 01:58:30.959
Or maybe

2520
01:58:31.209 --> 01:58:34.680
that a few like Gavind and others are very anxious.

2521
01:58:35.689 --> 01:58:36.529
Trying to

2522
01:58:37.089 --> 01:58:38.720
do their level best.

2523
01:58:39.640 --> 01:58:40.580
To do this

2524
01:58:42.649 --> 01:58:44.479
And I think on two points

2525
01:58:44.799 --> 01:58:45.919
might be we are failing.

2526
01:58:47.120 --> 01:58:48.109
One point is

2527
01:58:49.189 --> 01:58:49.839
That

2528
01:58:50.060 --> 01:58:53.060
we all must know what have we done for surgery.

2529
01:58:57.140 --> 01:58:59.100
Some people take 2 or 3.

2530
01:59:01.240 --> 01:59:02.069
Posters

2531
01:59:02.200 --> 01:59:03.390
and post them,

2532
01:59:03.399 --> 01:59:04.879
then they think they've done everything.

2533
01:59:05.740 --> 01:59:06.069
No.

2534
01:59:07.750 --> 01:59:08.580
You have to

2535
01:59:08.819 --> 01:59:10.859
do much more than anywhere else

2536
01:59:11.379 --> 01:59:12.759
because you are placed in

2537
01:59:13.660 --> 01:59:14.240
This

2538
01:59:14.819 --> 01:59:16.250
important thing called

2539
01:59:16.979 --> 01:59:17.680
The heart

2540
01:59:18.899 --> 01:59:22.740
Everybody has had an advantage of Sajo has been helped a lot.

2541
01:59:23.629 --> 01:59:26.100
We have to think what have we done for.

2542
01:59:30.180 --> 01:59:31.700
It has done so much for us.

2543
01:59:31.839 --> 01:59:33.540
What have we done for such?

2544
01:59:34.799 --> 01:59:35.830
That's very important.

2545
01:59:37.540 --> 01:59:39.160
So then there should be

2546
01:59:40.450 --> 01:59:43.229
I think I was expressing that anxiety which

2547
01:59:44.089 --> 01:59:45.200
The people who are

2548
01:59:47.689 --> 01:59:49.669
Your leaders and those who are worried

2549
01:59:50.279 --> 01:59:51.629
about Serva in England.

2550
01:59:53.089 --> 01:59:53.899
And

2551
01:59:54.169 --> 01:59:54.649
my lecture,

2552
01:59:54.729 --> 01:59:56.009
the whole lecture has that.

2553
01:59:57.450 --> 01:59:59.009
Tremendous concern.

2554
02:00:01.430 --> 02:00:02.490
And then we have to think,

2555
02:00:02.500 --> 02:00:03.540
what have we done?

2556
02:00:03.740 --> 02:00:04.620
We have houses,

2557
02:00:04.700 --> 02:00:05.470
we have places,

2558
02:00:05.500 --> 02:00:06.609
we have ashrams,

2559
02:00:06.779 --> 02:00:07.459
we have families,

2560
02:00:07.540 --> 02:00:08.299
we have wives,

2561
02:00:08.339 --> 02:00:09.169
we have

2562
02:00:09.270 --> 02:00:09.580
everything.

2563
02:00:10.810 --> 02:00:12.000
And the surga still,

2564
02:00:12.080 --> 02:00:13.279
if it is by the way.

2565
02:00:14.240 --> 02:00:15.160
Then this is the result.

2566
02:00:15.200 --> 02:00:17.950
You get 20 nonsensical arrogant people.

2567
02:00:19.910 --> 02:00:22.390
Don't get realisation some of them get it and get out.

2568
02:00:24.740 --> 02:00:29.140
So I think this is on one side is this that what have we done for such.

2569
02:00:30.299 --> 02:00:31.129
It should be

2570
02:00:31.569 --> 02:00:32.970
in other countries I'm not there,

2571
02:00:33.089 --> 02:00:34.720
so for them when I go there,

2572
02:00:34.890 --> 02:00:36.049
they went for 4 or 5 days.

2573
02:00:37.060 --> 02:00:39.640
The whole place is filled with my,

2574
02:00:39.799 --> 02:00:41.759
the whole place is filled with my

2575
02:00:42.609 --> 02:00:43.029
posters,

2576
02:00:43.129 --> 02:00:43.919
the whole place.

2577
02:00:44.919 --> 02:00:47.189
It has to be done every time I speak.

2578
02:00:51.339 --> 02:00:54.259
The whole of London should have been today filled with my posters.

2579
02:00:54.709 --> 02:00:55.259
I mean,

2580
02:00:55.270 --> 02:00:57.140
anybody who goes to say,

2581
02:00:57.390 --> 02:00:59.229
Switzerland or to Rome

2582
02:00:59.950 --> 02:01:00.600
or to

2583
02:01:01.859 --> 02:01:02.750
Paris,

2584
02:01:03.120 --> 02:01:06.330
they tell me Indians that we saw your posters all over the place,

2585
02:01:06.540 --> 02:01:07.859
but never has happened in London.

2586
02:01:12.970 --> 02:01:14.890
Now I hope this is not the last programme,

2587
02:01:15.009 --> 02:01:16.120
public programme in England.

2588
02:01:18.339 --> 02:01:19.319
But still

2589
02:01:19.759 --> 02:01:21.149
one has to work very hard.

2590
02:01:21.850 --> 02:01:24.549
All of you should think what you can do.

2591
02:01:25.270 --> 02:01:27.470
Because everybody has taken things.

2592
02:01:28.129 --> 02:01:29.120
In their own style,

2593
02:01:29.160 --> 02:01:30.450
like the leaders are worried.

2594
02:01:30.560 --> 02:01:31.359
They are working hard.

2595
02:01:31.500 --> 02:01:33.390
They're all trying to do things.

2596
02:01:34.109 --> 02:01:34.589
And

2597
02:01:35.870 --> 02:01:36.589
arrange things,

2598
02:01:36.689 --> 02:01:37.240
all that.

2599
02:01:38.370 --> 02:01:41.430
But what have you done is the point.

2600
02:01:41.720 --> 02:01:43.200
Now some people have had failures,

2601
02:01:43.359 --> 02:01:44.470
say for example,

2602
02:01:44.759 --> 02:01:46.669
some people had failures with the

2603
02:01:47.109 --> 02:01:50.359
officials and with the government or with the TV.

2604
02:01:50.399 --> 02:01:50.910
It doesn't matter.

2605
02:01:51.080 --> 02:01:52.259
We know we have failed it,

2606
02:01:52.560 --> 02:01:53.689
but advertising,

2607
02:01:53.919 --> 02:01:54.830
postering,

2608
02:01:55.080 --> 02:01:55.919
talking about it,

2609
02:01:56.080 --> 02:01:56.839
going around it.

2610
02:01:58.720 --> 02:02:00.100
All that can be done.

2611
02:02:00.439 --> 02:02:04.990
There's one part is very good in this respect is that outside London,

2612
02:02:05.160 --> 02:02:06.439
things are working out better.

2613
02:02:08.229 --> 02:02:10.060
But how many of you have been doing that?

2614
02:02:10.259 --> 02:02:10.700
Very few.

2615
02:02:11.669 --> 02:02:13.250
The same party goes here.

2616
02:02:13.459 --> 02:02:14.890
The same party has to do it

2617
02:02:15.259 --> 02:02:15.899
all the time.

2618
02:02:21.439 --> 02:02:21.790
No

2619
02:02:22.569 --> 02:02:24.520
Now this is one side of the

2620
02:02:24.810 --> 02:02:26.000
picture is that

2621
02:02:26.169 --> 02:02:31.209
that the advertising and all that has to be done more intensely extensively.

2622
02:02:32.799 --> 02:02:36.910
And everybody must offer their full support and services.

2623
02:02:40.049 --> 02:02:41.479
On the seminars side,

2624
02:02:41.529 --> 02:02:42.640
we are all very good.

2625
02:02:42.810 --> 02:02:43.930
Everything is done well,

2626
02:02:44.009 --> 02:02:44.680
I agree.

2627
02:02:44.979 --> 02:02:48.200
So many things are because we have to do so many things together,

2628
02:02:48.410 --> 02:02:48.970
but still.

2629
02:02:49.649 --> 02:02:50.520
You're being the heart,

2630
02:02:50.560 --> 02:02:52.250
you have to be you have to be

2631
02:02:53.720 --> 02:02:54.240
like that.

2632
02:02:54.319 --> 02:02:55.189
What can you do?

2633
02:02:56.859 --> 02:02:58.089
That's one part of it.

2634
02:02:58.770 --> 02:03:00.990
The second part of it I feel is

2635
02:03:01.399 --> 02:03:03.959
like we had in Hampstead about 300 people.

2636
02:03:04.859 --> 02:03:05.649
And they came

2637
02:03:07.169 --> 02:03:08.089
And

2638
02:03:09.359 --> 02:03:12.580
What I've learned is that when they came to the programme.

2639
02:03:13.959 --> 02:03:15.819
Nobody was sort of

2640
02:03:16.180 --> 02:03:17.020
openhearted,

2641
02:03:17.180 --> 02:03:19.819
sort of talked to them in that way as they should have.

2642
02:03:19.939 --> 02:03:21.359
Some of you did,

2643
02:03:21.740 --> 02:03:22.609
but not all.

2644
02:03:22.970 --> 02:03:24.299
Most of you are just sitting down.

2645
02:03:25.450 --> 02:03:26.910
Like if they come to my house,

2646
02:03:27.040 --> 02:03:28.640
they'll just sit down like this.

2647
02:03:29.290 --> 02:03:30.029
You cannot

2648
02:03:32.080 --> 02:03:33.339
You cannot just do that.

2649
02:03:33.419 --> 02:03:34.310
It's not done.

2650
02:03:35.629 --> 02:03:36.799
Come to my house.

2651
02:03:37.189 --> 02:03:38.240
Sit down like this.

2652
02:03:38.549 --> 02:03:40.990
Always they will come and sit down and put hands.

2653
02:03:42.140 --> 02:03:43.600
You can't do that.

2654
02:03:43.770 --> 02:03:45.529
That shows you are very insular.

2655
02:03:46.259 --> 02:03:47.209
Very selfish.

2656
02:03:49.459 --> 02:03:51.439
And also in a way arrogant.

2657
02:03:51.770 --> 02:03:54.089
You cannot take my vibrations without my permission,

2658
02:03:54.169 --> 02:03:54.490
can you?

2659
02:04:00.459 --> 02:04:01.060
So

2660
02:04:01.259 --> 02:04:03.220
this is suggestive of one thing

2661
02:04:03.580 --> 02:04:04.129
that

2662
02:04:04.419 --> 02:04:07.220
what we do is to take things for granted.

2663
02:04:08.129 --> 02:04:09.149
And

2664
02:04:09.390 --> 02:04:09.770
we,

2665
02:04:09.779 --> 02:04:12.580
when we talk to others also,

2666
02:04:12.709 --> 02:04:13.859
it takes time

2667
02:04:14.109 --> 02:04:15.350
for an Englishman to get up.

2668
02:04:16.689 --> 02:04:17.399
That's the thing is.

2669
02:04:19.540 --> 02:04:20.169
Now the,

2670
02:04:20.459 --> 02:04:25.009
the quality of this is this that in English do not want to interfere with anyone.

2671
02:04:25.220 --> 02:04:26.250
They want to leave them alone.

2672
02:04:26.459 --> 02:04:27.649
It's not a bad thing.

2673
02:04:27.979 --> 02:04:30.180
They want that why should we interfere?

2674
02:04:30.259 --> 02:04:30.810
I agree.

2675
02:04:31.180 --> 02:04:32.049
That's the point.

2676
02:04:32.950 --> 02:04:34.649
But that's not the point now.

2677
02:04:34.729 --> 02:04:35.979
We have to aggress.

2678
02:04:36.259 --> 02:04:37.740
This is the thing I'm bringing you to.

2679
02:04:38.359 --> 02:04:40.629
That means you don't mean that,

2680
02:04:40.709 --> 02:04:43.750
but what you mean is that not to interfere.

2681
02:04:44.149 --> 02:04:44.350
See,

2682
02:04:44.470 --> 02:04:46.479
they don't discuss religion in England.

2683
02:04:46.790 --> 02:04:47.220
No,

2684
02:04:47.390 --> 02:04:49.339
you're not supposed to say these things.

2685
02:04:49.629 --> 02:04:53.040
You are not to discuss whether you are a miss or a missus.

2686
02:04:53.430 --> 02:04:54.620
You are not to say

2687
02:04:55.830 --> 02:04:57.299
whether you have children or not.

2688
02:04:57.310 --> 02:04:58.430
If you ask somebody a question,

2689
02:04:58.589 --> 02:04:59.310
have you got children?

2690
02:04:59.390 --> 02:05:00.830
That means the most offensive thing.

2691
02:05:02.689 --> 02:05:04.600
You are not to discuss anybody's family.

2692
02:05:05.979 --> 02:05:06.939
There are so many

2693
02:05:07.080 --> 02:05:09.990
don'ts in this country so that we do not also

2694
02:05:10.540 --> 02:05:12.209
sort of get up worried

2695
02:05:12.959 --> 02:05:15.839
that maybe this may be taken as an interference.

2696
02:05:19.310 --> 02:05:21.339
But just opposite are Americans.

2697
02:05:22.120 --> 02:05:25.140
They will go up to the great grandfather

2698
02:05:25.390 --> 02:05:27.229
and up to the whole progeny to find out.

2699
02:05:30.509 --> 02:05:33.319
So interference should be forgotten.

2700
02:05:33.509 --> 02:05:34.870
There should be no fear about them.

2701
02:05:35.529 --> 02:05:39.319
But open your heart and talk to them openly with an open heart.

2702
02:05:40.140 --> 02:05:41.560
But people recede back.

2703
02:05:41.729 --> 02:05:43.000
Once they receipt back,

2704
02:05:43.410 --> 02:05:46.049
others also somehow get frightened

2705
02:05:46.649 --> 02:05:48.240
because they think you are just like them.

2706
02:05:48.410 --> 02:05:49.290
You have to be different.

2707
02:05:50.540 --> 02:05:50.549
Good.

2708
02:05:54.160 --> 02:05:58.209
So amongst English joists there are some who are very anxious,

2709
02:05:58.379 --> 02:05:58.790
very

2710
02:06:00.180 --> 02:06:02.430
Much worried that being so much

2711
02:06:02.879 --> 02:06:03.750
working it out.

2712
02:06:05.220 --> 02:06:07.060
Some of them are really indifferent.

2713
02:06:07.830 --> 02:06:10.850
And the middle part is those who are

2714
02:06:11.459 --> 02:06:12.810
still trying to see

2715
02:06:13.060 --> 02:06:13.930
how far to go,

2716
02:06:14.100 --> 02:06:15.370
how far not to go,

2717
02:06:15.939 --> 02:06:17.419
you have to be aggressive about it.

2718
02:06:19.759 --> 02:06:20.339
I mean,

2719
02:06:20.470 --> 02:06:23.740
as if now I feel the English have aggressed so much.

2720
02:06:24.500 --> 02:06:26.890
That now they are so fed up with aggressiveness.

2721
02:06:27.750 --> 02:06:29.790
That's the thing I want you to have today,

2722
02:06:29.799 --> 02:06:31.209
to be aggressive.

2723
02:06:33.430 --> 02:06:36.649
Aggressiveness is the only way you can reach these people,

2724
02:06:36.700 --> 02:06:37.859
otherwise they won't understand.

2725
02:06:39.040 --> 02:06:41.569
And you have to talk to them on their faces.

2726
02:06:41.910 --> 02:06:43.350
I've seen how people talk.

2727
02:06:43.390 --> 02:06:44.540
If you talk to them

2728
02:06:44.910 --> 02:06:45.290
like that,

2729
02:06:45.350 --> 02:06:46.069
they are all right.

2730
02:06:47.220 --> 02:06:50.569
Unless and until you work out that way when the people come,

2731
02:06:50.939 --> 02:06:53.890
you talk to them in an aggressively loving manner.

2732
02:06:54.060 --> 02:06:54.890
Do you understand that?

2733
02:06:56.879 --> 02:06:58.040
Exuberance

2734
02:06:58.759 --> 02:07:00.120
Just open out your heart.

2735
02:07:01.479 --> 02:07:01.680
How,

2736
02:07:01.759 --> 02:07:02.140
come down,

2737
02:07:02.279 --> 02:07:02.600
come down.

2738
02:07:02.759 --> 02:07:03.479
Where are you going?

2739
02:07:03.560 --> 02:07:04.000
Sit down.

2740
02:07:04.080 --> 02:07:04.629
What do you want?

2741
02:07:04.720 --> 02:07:05.120
You want?

2742
02:07:06.919 --> 02:07:08.669
One minute this one will look like this,

2743
02:07:08.680 --> 02:07:09.080
you see.

2744
02:07:10.069 --> 02:07:10.859
Second minute

2745
02:07:14.390 --> 02:07:18.140
You must understand your own character that exists in those people also.

2746
02:07:20.220 --> 02:07:21.129
The language starts,

2747
02:07:21.169 --> 02:07:21.959
I'm afraid.

2748
02:07:26.410 --> 02:07:28.500
So aggressively compassionate,

2749
02:07:28.569 --> 02:07:30.459
aggressively loving,

2750
02:07:30.620 --> 02:07:31.930
aggressively

2751
02:07:33.060 --> 02:07:33.939
openhearted.

2752
02:07:39.950 --> 02:07:42.490
Non-interference and all those ideas

2753
02:07:42.870 --> 02:07:44.709
are out of date now finished.

2754
02:07:46.770 --> 02:07:47.319
Now

2755
02:07:47.529 --> 02:07:48.529
openness.

2756
02:07:49.759 --> 02:07:50.709
No arrogance

2757
02:07:52.919 --> 02:07:53.870
No anger

2758
02:07:54.200 --> 02:07:55.399
but openness.

2759
02:07:59.089 --> 02:08:01.640
Aggressive innocent people like children are.

2760
02:08:05.629 --> 02:08:07.890
Children are so aggressively innocent

2761
02:08:08.109 --> 02:08:09.029
that you like it.

2762
02:08:12.390 --> 02:08:12.660
I mean,

2763
02:08:12.700 --> 02:08:13.970
if they catch hold of you,

2764
02:08:14.140 --> 02:08:17.770
they'll all come and jump on your body and sleep on top of you.

2765
02:08:20.540 --> 02:08:21.629
Kissing you all over.

2766
02:08:25.279 --> 02:08:25.810
That's how.

2767
02:08:27.359 --> 02:08:30.660
You have to be aggressively loving and aggressively

2768
02:08:30.990 --> 02:08:31.379
good.

2769
02:08:31.509 --> 02:08:32.009
What do you want,

2770
02:08:32.069 --> 02:08:33.029
you want something to eat.

2771
02:08:33.149 --> 02:08:33.790
You want this,

2772
02:08:33.830 --> 02:08:34.500
that,

2773
02:08:34.509 --> 02:08:34.629
that.

2774
02:08:35.899 --> 02:08:39.700
They'll be surprised how these English people have become like this.

2775
02:08:41.390 --> 02:08:43.259
So on these two things we fail.

2776
02:08:44.689 --> 02:08:46.390
And this anguish and this

2777
02:08:47.020 --> 02:08:48.470
anxiety that I have

2778
02:08:48.959 --> 02:08:49.660
is

2779
02:08:49.870 --> 02:08:52.350
is one of the expressions of the modern times

2780
02:08:53.120 --> 02:08:53.149
as known.

2781
02:08:54.729 --> 02:08:56.189
of the modern times

2782
02:08:56.680 --> 02:08:58.270
because modern times are so funny.

2783
02:08:58.910 --> 02:08:59.859
That if you click it,

2784
02:08:59.899 --> 02:09:00.770
you click it,

2785
02:09:00.879 --> 02:09:02.089
and if you don't click it,

2786
02:09:02.359 --> 02:09:04.100
it's so important,

2787
02:09:04.379 --> 02:09:06.299
so precarious is the word,

2788
02:09:06.660 --> 02:09:08.689
so precarious at this time if you don't click it,

2789
02:09:08.700 --> 02:09:09.339
it's finished.

2790
02:09:12.270 --> 02:09:14.060
So I find everyone.

2791
02:09:16.069 --> 02:09:18.870
is capable of doing lots of things for surgery.

2792
02:09:20.620 --> 02:09:22.470
But what have we done for surgery?

2793
02:09:23.410 --> 02:09:25.609
Nice in the seminar to come and enjoy.

2794
02:09:25.649 --> 02:09:26.399
It's a good idea.

2795
02:09:26.810 --> 02:09:29.140
Enjoy Sa Jogi's mother is collecting them.

2796
02:09:31.100 --> 02:09:33.129
One of the examples is that from the

2797
02:09:34.520 --> 02:09:35.660
Other countries

2798
02:09:35.879 --> 02:09:36.479
people come.

2799
02:09:38.129 --> 02:09:38.839
They are sick.

2800
02:09:38.919 --> 02:09:40.160
There are problems this that.

2801
02:09:41.160 --> 02:09:43.109
Immediately the telephone will ring me up saying,

2802
02:09:43.709 --> 02:09:43.950
Mother,

2803
02:09:44.049 --> 02:09:46.620
somebody has come with 10 boots

2804
02:09:47.470 --> 02:09:49.660
and 15 boots.

2805
02:09:52.649 --> 02:09:53.339
So what.

2806
02:09:54.229 --> 02:09:55.950
When should that person see you?

2807
02:09:56.060 --> 02:09:56.660
I said,

2808
02:09:56.750 --> 02:09:58.029
the person or the boots?

2809
02:10:02.459 --> 02:10:03.919
And the booths only come.

2810
02:10:04.450 --> 02:10:05.629
The person is busy.

2811
02:10:09.979 --> 02:10:12.049
At least you can reduce some numbers.

2812
02:10:13.419 --> 02:10:15.339
And then send such a person.

2813
02:10:19.250 --> 02:10:21.759
Now I've started using the hearth of my house

2814
02:10:22.529 --> 02:10:23.930
instead of the candle.

2815
02:10:25.819 --> 02:10:26.209
Now,

2816
02:10:26.220 --> 02:10:27.310
will you please

2817
02:10:28.529 --> 02:10:30.290
Look after the boots of the people.

2818
02:10:31.470 --> 02:10:32.160
And they come

2819
02:10:32.839 --> 02:10:35.189
And among you are there are many like that.

2820
02:10:36.270 --> 02:10:37.839
Your children are caught up.

2821
02:10:38.259 --> 02:10:39.970
Some of the wives are caught up.

2822
02:10:40.339 --> 02:10:41.899
Some of the husbands are caught up.

2823
02:10:43.649 --> 02:10:44.180
But

2824
02:10:44.359 --> 02:10:45.500
nobody pays attention.

2825
02:10:46.549 --> 02:10:47.470
Carrying on with that.

2826
02:10:48.470 --> 02:10:49.660
Sometimes even support it.

2827
02:10:52.020 --> 02:10:53.850
And just I see them

2828
02:10:54.129 --> 02:10:55.290
even staying in ashrams,

2829
02:10:55.330 --> 02:10:58.810
I must say some of them are really botish and troublesome.

2830
02:11:01.529 --> 02:11:04.790
And you think that you have to tolerate there's no

2831
02:11:05.200 --> 02:11:07.450
crucifixion needed anymore.

2832
02:11:08.890 --> 02:11:09.919
If somebody has a book,

2833
02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:11.640
better tell that person you're catching.

2834
02:11:12.790 --> 02:11:12.979
I mean,

2835
02:11:13.100 --> 02:11:14.250
I don't want to tell,

2836
02:11:14.740 --> 02:11:16.129
but you know what happens to me.

2837
02:11:17.229 --> 02:11:18.379
My hands and my feet,

2838
02:11:18.430 --> 02:11:19.750
they all go crazy.

2839
02:11:20.540 --> 02:11:22.040
And there's a boot button,

2840
02:11:23.120 --> 02:11:24.240
so I just don't know it.

2841
02:11:25.740 --> 02:11:26.569
In the same way,

2842
02:11:26.580 --> 02:11:27.839
it should happen to you,

2843
02:11:28.410 --> 02:11:30.399
and you should try to correct that person,

2844
02:11:30.439 --> 02:11:31.799
but nobody bothers,

2845
02:11:31.890 --> 02:11:32.120
you see,

2846
02:11:32.330 --> 02:11:34.680
because you think correction will be too much.

2847
02:11:36.589 --> 02:11:37.060
Oh,

2848
02:11:37.140 --> 02:11:38.899
maybe he might feel hurt and he run away.

2849
02:11:39.100 --> 02:11:39.930
Let him run away.

2850
02:11:40.990 --> 02:11:42.910
Take 2 running jumps and go to hell.

2851
02:11:44.479 --> 02:11:45.939
But the whole thing

2852
02:11:46.339 --> 02:11:49.770
should be a concern and anxiety and loving way.

2853
02:11:50.109 --> 02:11:51.580
Then you will attract that person.

2854
02:11:54.080 --> 02:11:57.169
I mean today I was really so full of vibrations.

2855
02:11:57.720 --> 02:11:58.939
Nothing would be sucked in.

2856
02:11:59.660 --> 02:12:01.839
These horrible 20 people are also they were,

2857
02:12:02.899 --> 02:12:05.169
they were stopping you also from sucking me.

2858
02:12:05.629 --> 02:12:08.100
I mean they were more powerful than you are in your suction,

2859
02:12:08.109 --> 02:12:08.450
I think.

2860
02:12:10.390 --> 02:12:12.370
So now there's something wrong with us.

2861
02:12:12.620 --> 02:12:16.049
What is that wrong is what have we done for Sir Juga?

2862
02:12:16.180 --> 02:12:17.330
First question.

2863
02:12:17.580 --> 02:12:18.209
Second is,

2864
02:12:18.379 --> 02:12:20.169
what am I doing about myself?

2865
02:12:20.419 --> 02:12:21.020
Where am I?

2866
02:12:22.089 --> 02:12:23.479
Nice to ask the question.

2867
02:12:23.740 --> 02:12:26.970
What's the difference between a God realised and a self-reliance?

2868
02:12:27.339 --> 02:12:29.029
God realised never catches.

2869
02:12:39.979 --> 02:12:40.740
Just knows.

2870
02:12:45.120 --> 02:12:47.209
Now why do I feel horrible?

2871
02:12:48.459 --> 02:12:49.470
Only with surgeries,

2872
02:12:49.620 --> 02:12:50.899
no with non-surgeries.

2873
02:12:52.580 --> 02:12:54.330
Even when Naakasura comes before me,

2874
02:12:54.600 --> 02:12:55.450
I can kill him.

2875
02:12:56.709 --> 02:12:58.569
But surgeries are inside my body.

2876
02:12:58.660 --> 02:12:59.500
What am I to do?

2877
02:12:59.580 --> 02:13:01.140
They are part and parcel of me.

2878
02:13:01.180 --> 02:13:02.250
They are not foreigners.

2879
02:13:03.390 --> 02:13:04.379
So when they get sick,

2880
02:13:04.419 --> 02:13:07.529
I get sick myself because they are inside myself.

2881
02:13:07.740 --> 02:13:09.430
No deity has done that.

2882
02:13:09.850 --> 02:13:11.540
No incarnation has done that job.

2883
02:13:12.970 --> 02:13:13.959
Nobody has

2884
02:13:14.529 --> 02:13:15.810
injected Sajogi

2885
02:13:16.660 --> 02:13:17.560
inside their body.

2886
02:13:17.689 --> 02:13:19.169
Has anyone done that way?

2887
02:13:19.939 --> 02:13:21.640
You're all inside my body,

2888
02:13:22.049 --> 02:13:22.979
part and parcel.

2889
02:13:24.770 --> 02:13:26.600
When something goes wrong with you,

2890
02:13:27.229 --> 02:13:28.439
it goes wrong with me inside,

2891
02:13:28.540 --> 02:13:28.930
naturally,

2892
02:13:28.970 --> 02:13:29.729
if I take,

2893
02:13:29.890 --> 02:13:31.799
it's indiscriminate you can say,

2894
02:13:32.169 --> 02:13:34.600
but if I were not indiscriminate,

2895
02:13:34.890 --> 02:13:36.799
how many would have gone inside my body?

2896
02:13:36.970 --> 02:13:38.169
That's how I can cleanse you.

2897
02:13:41.259 --> 02:13:42.620
I can look after you.

2898
02:13:42.970 --> 02:13:45.009
I can know about to work out things very well.

2899
02:13:45.689 --> 02:13:47.680
Something happens to someone in Australia,

2900
02:13:47.890 --> 02:13:50.330
I can work it out here because he's in my body.

2901
02:13:55.250 --> 02:13:56.689
That's why I get.

2902
02:13:58.669 --> 02:14:00.009
I can say I get caught up

2903
02:14:02.370 --> 02:14:03.959
Because I've got boots within me.

2904
02:14:06.439 --> 02:14:08.729
So you must keep out your boots.

2905
02:14:08.930 --> 02:14:09.930
This is the 3rd point,

2906
02:14:10.009 --> 02:14:10.879
very important.

2907
02:14:11.250 --> 02:14:12.689
How can I have boots in me?

2908
02:14:12.850 --> 02:14:13.810
How can I have?

2909
02:14:14.520 --> 02:14:15.430
Left side

2910
02:14:15.640 --> 02:14:17.229
or right side or anything.

2911
02:14:17.319 --> 02:14:19.600
I am in the body of mother.

2912
02:14:20.979 --> 02:14:22.000
Was that

2913
02:14:22.640 --> 02:14:23.790
What a privilege.

2914
02:14:24.290 --> 02:14:25.040
What an honour.

2915
02:14:25.649 --> 02:14:27.680
So now I can't have any boots within myself.

2916
02:14:28.299 --> 02:14:30.250
It has to be something very pure.

2917
02:14:34.689 --> 02:14:36.220
So try to purify us.

2918
02:14:37.430 --> 02:14:38.089
Keep yourself.

2919
02:14:39.189 --> 02:14:40.990
What I'm saying now is for English,

2920
02:14:41.029 --> 02:14:41.950
is for all of you.

2921
02:14:43.709 --> 02:14:44.439
English being

2922
02:14:44.729 --> 02:14:45.879
always the leaders

2923
02:14:46.209 --> 02:14:47.759
for starting something good,

2924
02:14:48.049 --> 02:14:49.319
I have to talk to them more.

2925
02:14:50.089 --> 02:14:51.049
They've done it

2926
02:14:51.479 --> 02:14:51.870
because

2927
02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:53.270
they were the ones

2928
02:14:53.759 --> 02:14:55.189
who fought the war,

2929
02:14:55.799 --> 02:14:56.359
won it,

2930
02:14:56.459 --> 02:14:58.759
and that's how we started under the tides.

2931
02:14:59.609 --> 02:15:01.549
But now the instruments.

2932
02:15:02.310 --> 02:15:03.810
That we are going to use

2933
02:15:04.100 --> 02:15:05.540
have to be that powerful.

2934
02:15:06.580 --> 02:15:07.839
If Europeans

2935
02:15:08.729 --> 02:15:11.439
Among them say Brussels people come up very well.

2936
02:15:12.319 --> 02:15:13.669
Then I'll shift my attention.

2937
02:15:13.839 --> 02:15:15.350
We can shift hard these days.

2938
02:15:15.600 --> 02:15:16.990
Transplant is possible.

2939
02:15:20.649 --> 02:15:20.660
Hm.

2940
02:15:23.470 --> 02:15:24.339
Have you heard

2941
02:15:24.549 --> 02:15:27.189
of heart from the right move to the left?

2942
02:15:28.270 --> 02:15:29.580
Or left to the right.

2943
02:15:31.430 --> 02:15:32.589
God can do it.

2944
02:15:32.990 --> 02:15:35.580
There are people born with a heart on the right hand side also.

2945
02:15:40.029 --> 02:15:40.689
So

2946
02:15:41.899 --> 02:15:43.209
To be very precise,

2947
02:15:44.479 --> 02:15:47.069
I think that this seminar should be used.

2948
02:15:48.189 --> 02:15:50.830
For also having an inner in inside.

2949
02:15:51.919 --> 02:15:52.439
See

2950
02:15:53.089 --> 02:15:56.029
What have we done for surgery?

2951
02:16:08.009 --> 02:16:08.890
That will help.

2952
02:16:09.879 --> 02:16:10.629
Secondly,

2953
02:16:11.700 --> 02:16:13.350
Very important is,

2954
02:16:13.600 --> 02:16:15.000
are we openhearted?

2955
02:16:21.970 --> 02:16:22.819
Now for example,

2956
02:16:25.419 --> 02:16:26.689
We can say like this.

2957
02:16:28.040 --> 02:16:28.939
That's for the

2958
02:16:31.979 --> 02:16:33.190
I'm in the house

2959
02:16:33.330 --> 02:16:34.558
and the bell rings up.

2960
02:16:35.648 --> 02:16:37.148
If there's an American,

2961
02:16:37.739 --> 02:16:38.588
I'll I'll get it.

2962
02:16:38.758 --> 02:16:40.239
He'll be the first to run.

2963
02:16:40.977 --> 02:16:42.638
And English would be looking this side,

2964
02:16:42.689 --> 02:16:43.208
that side.

2965
02:16:45.008 --> 02:16:46.848
Because it's kind of a lethargic.

2966
02:16:47.940 --> 02:16:48.570
That is.

2967
02:16:50.940 --> 02:16:54.160
Because that's the idea of the negative to freeze the heart.

2968
02:16:59.509 --> 02:17:00.830
And that freezing

2969
02:17:01.660 --> 02:17:02.879
is to be avoided.

2970
02:17:03.718 --> 02:17:04.558
I'll get it.

2971
02:17:04.709 --> 02:17:05.388
I'll do it.

2972
02:17:07.530 --> 02:17:08.308
I'll work it out

2973
02:17:13.009 --> 02:17:14.049
I have to do it

2974
02:17:15.080 --> 02:17:16.218
That must be told.

2975
02:17:16.669 --> 02:17:21.540
All the English jugs must know that they have to be the most active people,

2976
02:17:21.549 --> 02:17:22.099
do you know,

2977
02:17:22.269 --> 02:17:26.509
even when we sleep and the heart is beating all the time till we exist.

2978
02:17:31.879 --> 02:17:32.558
So

2979
02:17:32.759 --> 02:17:33.870
I have to tell you

2980
02:17:34.200 --> 02:17:37.190
that you bear a very big responsibility to surgery.

2981
02:17:37.419 --> 02:17:38.320
That's why I've been here.

2982
02:17:38.360 --> 02:17:39.410
I've been with you,

2983
02:17:39.419 --> 02:17:41.558
and that doesn't mean you should take things for granted.

2984
02:17:45.499 --> 02:17:47.199
You can do a lot.

2985
02:17:47.348 --> 02:17:48.699
You have to circulate.

2986
02:17:48.977 --> 02:17:51.628
Maybe English surgeries will have to travel a lot.

2987
02:17:53.849 --> 02:17:55.349
But first of all,

2988
02:17:55.718 --> 02:17:56.750
first and foremost,

2989
02:17:56.830 --> 02:17:57.790
open your heart.

2990
02:18:02.388 --> 02:18:03.490
Openly

2991
02:18:03.790 --> 02:18:04.750
and sweetly.

2992
02:18:09.549 --> 02:18:10.730
You have children,

2993
02:18:11.138 --> 02:18:11.790
learn from them,

2994
02:18:11.940 --> 02:18:12.780
how they talk,

2995
02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:14.058
how sweetly they move.

2996
02:18:18.400 --> 02:18:19.750
Really open your heart.

2997
02:18:21.540 --> 02:18:23.759
Unless and until you open your heart,

2998
02:18:24.049 --> 02:18:26.200
how can you do anything for anybody else?

2999
02:18:30.540 --> 02:18:32.169
And that's what one has to achieve.

3000
02:18:33.529 --> 02:18:34.409
I'm sure

3001
02:18:35.250 --> 02:18:36.200
Next programme.

3002
02:18:36.849 --> 02:18:39.070
I can see myself all over

3003
02:18:39.240 --> 02:18:39.718
London.

3004
02:18:40.740 --> 02:18:41.209
All right.

3005
02:18:49.299 --> 02:18:49.308
Hello.

3006
02:18:50.249 --> 02:18:51.208
Now don't feel guilty.

3007
02:18:51.289 --> 02:18:52.398
I'm getting terrible pain.

3008
02:18:56.648 --> 02:18:57.678
Don't feel guilty.

3009
02:18:57.829 --> 02:18:58.418
Face it,

3010
02:18:58.588 --> 02:18:58.928
yes,

3011
02:18:58.989 --> 02:18:59.699
it's true.

3012
02:19:00.268 --> 02:19:01.779
Don't feel guilty about it,

3013
02:19:01.869 --> 02:19:02.508
for heaven's sake,

3014
02:19:02.609 --> 02:19:05.189
don't feel guilty because I'm now getting a terrible pain again.

3015
02:19:07.360 --> 02:19:07.799
Hm.

3016
02:19:09.530 --> 02:19:10.160
Put this

3017
02:19:11.318 --> 02:19:12.398
The food has arrived,

3018
02:19:12.579 --> 02:19:12.749
are they?

3019
02:19:13.690 --> 02:19:14.040
So

3020
02:19:15.410 --> 02:19:16.830
We can have some music,

3021
02:19:17.429 --> 02:19:17.910
all right,

3022
02:19:18.080 --> 02:19:20.599
then I'll go because tomorrow I have to come for your pooja.

3023
02:19:21.480 --> 02:19:23.950
So if you don't mind tomorrow about

3024
02:19:24.269 --> 02:19:25.910
11 o'clock we'll start the pooja,

3025
02:19:26.440 --> 02:19:28.308
but those who have to cancel that thing,

3026
02:19:28.440 --> 02:19:29.910
I hope you manage that tomorrow.

3027
02:19:29.959 --> 02:19:30.919
I bless you with that.

3028
02:19:31.870 --> 02:19:32.440
We got this.

3029
02:19:36.370 --> 02:19:40.679
has just said lunch is absolutely fixed at this place at 12:15,

3030
02:19:40.769 --> 02:19:41.360
they won't move.

3031
02:19:42.929 --> 02:19:44.650
150.

3032
02:19:45.519 --> 02:19:46.759
We can start at 10 o'clock.

3033
02:19:48.759 --> 02:19:50.660
We can start food at 10.

3034
02:19:51.030 --> 02:19:51.230
I mean,

3035
02:19:51.429 --> 02:19:52.190
for me it's all right.

3036
02:19:52.230 --> 02:19:53.589
I can even start at 9.

3037
02:19:54.349 --> 02:19:55.809
But what about you people?

3038
02:19:57.030 --> 02:19:57.040
Well,

3039
02:19:58.059 --> 02:20:00.700
I can start at 66.

3040
02:20:01.719 --> 02:20:02.990
What just now?

3041
02:20:04.559 --> 02:20:04.759
I mean,

3042
02:20:04.959 --> 02:20:07.000
it's not that we could have it after lunch it'd be better.

3043
02:20:07.820 --> 02:20:09.019
But what about others?

3044
02:20:09.950 --> 02:20:10.030
No,

3045
02:20:10.070 --> 02:20:11.500
it's better to have it before.

3046
02:20:11.870 --> 02:20:11.910
No,

3047
02:20:11.990 --> 02:20:12.379
it's,

3048
02:20:12.509 --> 02:20:12.769
you see,

3049
02:20:12.839 --> 02:20:13.339
actually,

3050
02:20:13.349 --> 02:20:14.339
it's this,

3051
02:20:14.429 --> 02:20:15.019
there is,

3052
02:20:15.110 --> 02:20:17.679
I don't know what sort of uja it is going to be because

3053
02:20:18.019 --> 02:20:19.209
see it's a Vishnu Mayas,

3054
02:20:19.309 --> 02:20:19.730
uh,

3055
02:20:19.750 --> 02:20:20.049
this thing,

3056
02:20:20.099 --> 02:20:20.429
you see,

3057
02:20:20.509 --> 02:20:23.230
so we can have a short puja Vishnu Maya so.

3058
02:20:23.980 --> 02:20:25.379
It has to be done in the night,

3059
02:20:25.450 --> 02:20:26.209
no doubt,

3060
02:20:26.690 --> 02:20:27.929
in the sense that

3061
02:20:30.969 --> 02:20:31.750
It doesn't matter.

3062
02:20:32.080 --> 02:20:32.780
It's no difference.

3063
02:20:35.169 --> 02:20:36.879
It's uh you can call it a

3064
02:20:37.690 --> 02:20:38.599
global puja,

3065
02:20:38.769 --> 02:20:39.530
some sort of thing.

3066
02:20:41.190 --> 02:20:41.799
General we can call it,

3067
02:20:41.809 --> 02:20:42.240
I don't know.

3068
02:20:46.849 --> 02:20:48.719
Which to my eye is something so

3069
02:20:49.089 --> 02:20:49.530
powerful.

3070
02:20:52.919 --> 02:20:53.509
All right,

3071
02:20:53.830 --> 02:20:55.139
so let's have some music

3072
02:20:55.309 --> 02:20:56.269
and then I'll go back.

3073
02:20:58.599 --> 02:20:59.200
Just tell

3074
02:21:00.089 --> 02:21:01.349
her not to wait for my food.

3075
02:21:02.469 --> 02:21:02.660
I

3076
02:21:03.660 --> 02:21:04.440
It's good.

3077
02:21:05.849 --> 02:21:06.849
If that she should eat up.

3078
02:21:08.070 --> 02:21:08.980
So let's see now,

3079
02:21:09.070 --> 02:21:10.540
what is the contribution.

3080
02:21:10.830 --> 02:21:13.349
Now you have seen the music that has come from Nasi.

3081
02:21:14.950 --> 02:21:16.589
What a professional music it was.

3082
02:21:16.669 --> 02:21:17.740
Did you hear that?

3083
02:21:19.610 --> 02:21:21.200
Now what are we to produce?

3084
02:21:23.349 --> 02:21:24.440
Just look at that.

3085
02:21:24.669 --> 02:21:26.990
It was a real professional thing they have done.

3086
02:21:29.490 --> 02:21:31.650
So we should try to find out something better,

3087
02:21:31.860 --> 02:21:32.429
all right,

3088
02:21:33.080 --> 02:21:34.639
now let's have some music.

3089
02:21:36.669 --> 02:21:36.679
Well,

3090
02:21:52.030 --> 02:21:52.080
what do you think so?

3091
02:21:52.089 --> 02:21:52.110
All right,

3092
02:21:52.120 --> 02:21:52.139
all right,

3093
02:21:52.150 --> 02:21:52.169
all right.

3094
02:21:52.179 --> 02:21:52.290
What is cooked in this one and this one,

3095
02:21:52.299 --> 02:21:52.309
yeah,

3096
02:21:52.320 --> 02:21:52.740
plain plain,

3097
02:21:53.019 --> 02:21:53.919
plain one I like.

3098
02:21:55.009 --> 02:21:56.129
And that I can,

3099
02:21:56.150 --> 02:21:56.169
all right,

3100
02:21:56.179 --> 02:21:56.200
all right,

3101
02:21:58.299 --> 02:21:59.809
I'll try to manage something.

3102
02:22:00.950 --> 02:22:02.379
Now let's have some music.

3103
02:23:37.400 --> 02:23:37.650
I'm.

3104
02:24:17.209 --> 02:24:18.299
Now for India too.

3105
02:24:21.139 --> 02:24:21.750
You see,

3106
02:24:22.030 --> 02:24:23.070
this may be there,

3107
02:24:23.280 --> 02:24:24.160
as I told you.

3108
02:24:25.330 --> 02:24:26.400
I don't know

3109
02:24:26.790 --> 02:24:28.709
this year or maybe next year,

3110
02:24:28.790 --> 02:24:29.900
maybe the last year,

3111
02:24:30.070 --> 02:24:30.690
I can't say.

3112
02:24:32.219 --> 02:24:35.410
The reason is once we have established our ashrams in India.

3113
02:24:36.700 --> 02:24:38.809
I don't think I'll be able to take all this.

3114
02:24:40.169 --> 02:24:41.780
Around all the villages and all that,

3115
02:24:41.849 --> 02:24:42.769
once we have ashrams,

3116
02:24:42.809 --> 02:24:44.530
they will all come down to see us there.

3117
02:24:45.219 --> 02:24:46.040
In India,

3118
02:24:46.269 --> 02:24:47.780
for them it's a pilgrimage.

3119
02:24:48.500 --> 02:24:50.490
And they go out of the way to do it.

3120
02:24:51.280 --> 02:24:51.929
So

3121
02:24:52.250 --> 02:24:53.879
when you people are coming there

3122
02:24:54.519 --> 02:24:56.450
after once we have established our ashram.

3123
02:24:57.820 --> 02:24:59.370
There won't be any

3124
02:24:59.700 --> 02:25:01.259
of these India toos much.

3125
02:25:02.099 --> 02:25:02.799
Which you

3126
02:25:03.059 --> 02:25:03.799
have enjoyed very well.

3127
02:25:04.660 --> 02:25:05.169
Maybe

3128
02:25:05.940 --> 02:25:07.500
this might be the last year or next year.

3129
02:25:07.540 --> 02:25:08.030
I don't know.

3130
02:25:08.169 --> 02:25:10.469
It depends on as soon as we establish Tash.

3131
02:25:12.209 --> 02:25:12.679
Now,

3132
02:25:14.690 --> 02:25:15.599
I see that

3133
02:25:17.240 --> 02:25:17.879
People

3134
02:25:20.450 --> 02:25:23.280
Do not understand the value of Indian to also.

3135
02:25:25.410 --> 02:25:28.509
It does a lot of good to you because it's a country

3136
02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:29.719
which is heavenly,

3137
02:25:29.799 --> 02:25:30.209
I should say,

3138
02:25:30.240 --> 02:25:31.759
as far as vibrations are concerned.

3139
02:25:32.679 --> 02:25:34.719
Sometimes I feel we are living in hell here

3140
02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:35.429
because

3141
02:25:35.639 --> 02:25:36.750
I see the TV

3142
02:25:36.879 --> 02:25:38.240
and horrible things and

3143
02:25:38.599 --> 02:25:39.959
I mean it's really terrible.

3144
02:25:40.870 --> 02:25:42.620
There are so many Indians who have come here

3145
02:25:42.620 --> 02:25:44.980
and they say that they lose their vibrations,

3146
02:25:45.269 --> 02:25:46.049
not only here,

3147
02:25:46.059 --> 02:25:46.910
America anywhere.

3148
02:25:47.969 --> 02:25:49.019
So the Indian tour,

3149
02:25:49.129 --> 02:25:50.980
though apart from anything else itself,

3150
02:25:50.990 --> 02:25:54.169
is visiting India is still a clearer country,

3151
02:25:54.330 --> 02:25:55.250
especially Maharashtra.

3152
02:25:56.830 --> 02:25:57.219
No.

3153
02:25:57.950 --> 02:25:59.730
It's time to make it convenient.

3154
02:26:01.230 --> 02:26:02.830
We have made it for 3 weeks.

3155
02:26:04.190 --> 02:26:05.870
So you're there only for 3 weeks,

3156
02:26:05.950 --> 02:26:06.700
2 weeks?

3157
02:26:08.650 --> 02:26:10.320
Around at one week

3158
02:26:10.610 --> 02:26:11.370
around the sea,

3159
02:26:11.500 --> 02:26:11.690
sure.

3160
02:26:12.549 --> 02:26:12.709
No,

3161
02:26:12.870 --> 02:26:14.429
actually we will not have many.

3162
02:26:15.219 --> 02:26:16.410
Public programmes.

3163
02:26:17.480 --> 02:26:19.849
But that is something every year.

3164
02:26:21.849 --> 02:26:22.799
If you cannot do it,

3165
02:26:22.879 --> 02:26:24.879
at least alternate years should have been done.

3166
02:26:26.110 --> 02:26:26.299
Well,

3167
02:26:26.379 --> 02:26:27.389
I find that

3168
02:26:28.269 --> 02:26:31.429
That people don't understand the importance of Indian.

3169
02:26:32.889 --> 02:26:37.120
99% of people who have been to India settled down in search.

3170
02:26:39.269 --> 02:26:40.570
There must be something about it.

3171
02:26:41.780 --> 02:26:43.679
So those who are going to,

3172
02:26:43.719 --> 02:26:46.240
and now we have made it the minimum possible

3173
02:26:46.599 --> 02:26:48.150
though everybody warned us,

3174
02:26:48.769 --> 02:26:51.599
Warren said that it's going to be very expensive,

3175
02:26:51.639 --> 02:26:52.849
it is 10 times more.

3176
02:26:52.959 --> 02:26:53.830
Everything is there.

3177
02:26:54.320 --> 02:26:55.519
What minimum we have put it.

3178
02:26:56.610 --> 02:26:57.009
Luckily,

3179
02:26:57.049 --> 02:26:58.320
also Air India,

3180
02:26:58.730 --> 02:27:00.650
because it had so many accidents,

3181
02:27:01.089 --> 02:27:02.129
it has gone very cheap.

3182
02:27:03.429 --> 02:27:04.599
And you people

3183
02:27:04.849 --> 02:27:07.959
should know that if you have to go pay the money in time,

3184
02:27:08.169 --> 02:27:10.139
you're still waiting for the last minute.

3185
02:27:10.650 --> 02:27:11.959
I'm going to be here for a month.

3186
02:27:12.009 --> 02:27:12.610
I know that.

3187
02:27:13.349 --> 02:27:16.320
But that doesn't mean that you should take so much time.

3188
02:27:16.490 --> 02:27:17.730
It's like a pilgrimage.

3189
02:27:19.759 --> 02:27:21.320
And everybody should try.

3190
02:27:22.540 --> 02:27:23.730
Everybody should try.

3191
02:27:23.820 --> 02:27:25.059
I cannot manage many,

3192
02:27:25.139 --> 02:27:27.089
but quite a lot we can manage now

3193
02:27:27.299 --> 02:27:28.900
because we have made two tools now.

3194
02:27:29.669 --> 02:27:31.419
In case you cannot manage the first two,

3195
02:27:31.459 --> 02:27:32.419
you come for the 2nd.

3196
02:27:33.740 --> 02:27:35.110
But it's not so difficult,

3197
02:27:35.410 --> 02:27:36.400
but if you see,

3198
02:27:36.690 --> 02:27:38.480
I've now noticed people.

3199
02:27:39.299 --> 02:27:41.900
Quite closely that people waste their money a lot.

3200
02:27:45.299 --> 02:27:46.820
Just the other way around Indians.

3201
02:27:47.490 --> 02:27:48.150
You know

3202
02:27:48.360 --> 02:27:50.599
they keep all the money just.

3203
02:27:51.540 --> 02:27:52.809
For my tour there.

3204
02:27:54.879 --> 02:27:56.120
Keep all their holidays,

3205
02:27:56.240 --> 02:27:57.599
all their money for the tour,

3206
02:27:57.900 --> 02:28:01.120
though they do not gain so much as you people gain.

3207
02:28:01.889 --> 02:28:02.969
Because it's a new world,

3208
02:28:03.009 --> 02:28:03.480
you go to.

3209
02:28:06.459 --> 02:28:07.919
So those who are coming,

3210
02:28:09.969 --> 02:28:10.849
Should decide,

3211
02:28:10.969 --> 02:28:14.019
but those who are not coming also must think it out.

3212
02:28:15.299 --> 02:28:16.269
It's not difficult.

3213
02:28:19.709 --> 02:28:20.790
It's better.

3214
02:28:21.099 --> 02:28:22.900
I hope this is not the last time,

3215
02:28:22.940 --> 02:28:24.730
but maybe I can't say

3216
02:28:25.179 --> 02:28:26.379
because once we have an ashram,

3217
02:28:26.419 --> 02:28:30.179
then why we not go all over the Indians will all come from all over India.

3218
02:28:30.219 --> 02:28:30.929
They'll come.

3219
02:28:31.459 --> 02:28:33.139
People are already coming from Madras,

3220
02:28:33.179 --> 02:28:34.379
even if I have a small little room,

3221
02:28:34.419 --> 02:28:34.940
they come down.

3222
02:28:36.650 --> 02:28:38.610
Because we have no place to make them stay,

3223
02:28:38.690 --> 02:28:39.160
that's fine.

3224
02:28:39.250 --> 02:28:42.009
Otherwise you will be surprised they will be all there.

3225
02:28:42.530 --> 02:28:44.459
You won't be able to see yourself.

3226
02:28:44.690 --> 02:28:45.330
You'll be so.

3227
02:28:46.429 --> 02:28:47.620
Before that starts,

3228
02:28:47.790 --> 02:28:51.110
you must understand that you have to go to India some or other.

3229
02:28:53.120 --> 02:28:54.139
At least once.

3230
02:28:57.110 --> 02:28:57.879
Next year

3231
02:28:58.030 --> 02:28:59.450
or this year you have.

3232
02:29:00.019 --> 02:29:01.839
But I can't even promise next year.

3233
02:29:01.919 --> 02:29:02.950
I really tell you.

3234
02:29:03.240 --> 02:29:04.049
I must say

3235
02:29:04.639 --> 02:29:07.780
that 90% next year we'll have the programme,

3236
02:29:08.719 --> 02:29:10.339
because it's becoming very difficult,

3237
02:29:10.719 --> 02:29:12.629
very difficult money wise also.

3238
02:29:13.709 --> 02:29:14.690
And otherwise

3239
02:29:14.900 --> 02:29:16.219
it's becoming sunwieldy.

3240
02:29:17.599 --> 02:29:18.110
So

3241
02:29:18.290 --> 02:29:20.480
I would request you to think it over,

3242
02:29:20.650 --> 02:29:23.490
and those who want to come should give your names.

3243
02:29:23.610 --> 02:29:25.280
Even if you have not paid the money,

3244
02:29:25.610 --> 02:29:27.669
can do it because I'm here for this month.

3245
02:29:28.209 --> 02:29:29.410
So those who have not

3246
02:29:29.650 --> 02:29:32.190
yet given your names also can give your names to come in

3247
02:29:32.889 --> 02:29:33.809
and will adjust it.

3248
02:29:38.040 --> 02:29:39.240
But I cannot make it,

3249
02:29:39.320 --> 02:29:39.790
I mean.

3250
02:29:41.099 --> 02:29:43.169
I wanted to make it much cheaper for you,

3251
02:29:43.190 --> 02:29:46.259
but it's not the food that is expensive with the travelling,

3252
02:29:46.290 --> 02:29:47.969
but now travelling has become much cheaper.

3253
02:29:56.269 --> 02:29:56.780
But

3254
02:29:57.219 --> 02:29:58.299
everything is by the way,

3255
02:29:58.419 --> 02:29:59.410
that's the trouble is.

3256
02:30:02.099 --> 02:30:02.799
By the way,

3257
02:30:03.669 --> 02:30:04.190
You see,

3258
02:30:04.290 --> 02:30:05.639
if you want to save money,

3259
02:30:05.849 --> 02:30:07.480
and people will save money

3260
02:30:07.730 --> 02:30:09.019
to buy a Rolls-Royce,

3261
02:30:09.290 --> 02:30:09.790
which cost,

3262
02:30:09.809 --> 02:30:10.870
I don't know how much

3263
02:30:11.530 --> 02:30:13.259
for that horrible fellow in one year.

3264
02:30:14.339 --> 02:30:17.200
And such can't have money to go to India.

3265
02:30:19.019 --> 02:30:19.769
I believe it.

3266
02:30:22.799 --> 02:30:25.070
At least once everybody should go watch it.

3267
02:30:30.440 --> 02:30:31.360
Because it hurts.

3268
02:30:32.320 --> 02:30:33.360
Hs them such a lot.

3269
02:30:38.440 --> 02:30:40.599
I myself never knew that it would help so much,

3270
02:30:40.610 --> 02:30:41.759
but I now believe

3271
02:30:42.370 --> 02:30:43.009
it does help.

3272
02:30:45.990 --> 02:30:50.780
So those who have not yet given money also can give their names to the.

3273
02:30:52.030 --> 02:30:53.219
Or to their leaders.

3274
02:30:57.580 --> 02:30:58.549
We'll be saving,

3275
02:30:58.830 --> 02:31:00.580
staying for 7 days

3276
02:31:01.150 --> 02:31:02.030
on the seashore,

3277
02:31:02.150 --> 02:31:03.099
and beautiful,

3278
02:31:03.549 --> 02:31:05.030
one of the best in the whole world.

3279
02:31:06.589 --> 02:31:07.400
Well Ganesha is there.

3280
02:31:08.070 --> 02:31:08.730
And

3281
02:31:08.929 --> 02:31:10.230
the water of the

3282
02:31:11.150 --> 02:31:12.830
She comes out of his nay.

3283
02:31:13.879 --> 02:31:18.309
I only his lower body you can see the head is the mountain itself.

3284
02:31:19.160 --> 02:31:20.910
You can see the lights coming out of it.

3285
02:31:20.950 --> 02:31:22.269
Only the surgeons can see.

3286
02:31:26.759 --> 02:31:27.469
I don't know,

3287
02:31:27.480 --> 02:31:28.750
but next year also.

3288
02:31:29.919 --> 02:31:32.230
But it should not be a thing that is.

3289
02:31:33.070 --> 02:31:34.110
I sort of uh,

3290
02:31:34.469 --> 02:31:35.179
by the way.

3291
02:31:36.709 --> 02:31:37.610
That's important.

3292
02:31:41.620 --> 02:31:43.730
So let's just see what's happening because

3293
02:31:46.030 --> 02:31:47.469
Australians have quite a lot coming.

3294
02:31:49.750 --> 02:31:50.620
And

3295
02:31:50.940 --> 02:31:52.459
we have to see about others also.

3296
02:31:55.269 --> 02:31:55.280
Right.

3297
02:31:57.009 --> 02:31:57.620
May God bless you.

3298
02:32:09.139 --> 02:32:10.490
Well that sounds nice.

3299
02:32:12.429 --> 02:32:14.389
Now look at the music they produced,

3300
02:32:15.160 --> 02:32:16.030
the quality.

3301
02:32:19.820 --> 02:32:21.089
Try to compete with them.

3302
02:32:55.059 --> 02:32:55.370
There's

3303
02:32:56.349 --> 02:32:56.620
No.

3304
02:32:58.370 --> 02:32:59.620
Just think of it,

3305
02:33:00.110 --> 02:33:00.820
and I know.

3306
02:33:02.400 --> 02:33:04.330
He got his election only last year,

3307
02:33:04.809 --> 02:33:05.250
last year.

3308
02:33:07.759 --> 02:33:09.679
Last year this fellow got his real Irish.

3309
02:33:11.799 --> 02:33:12.650
In one year,

3310
02:33:23.719 --> 02:33:24.580
We have made

3311
02:33:25.469 --> 02:33:29.139
copies of that music for you people to be given you as presents

3312
02:33:29.589 --> 02:33:30.709
only to the leaders.

3313
02:36:09.969 --> 02:36:10.179
Oh

3314
02:36:26.389 --> 02:36:26.400
Yeah.

3315
02:36:49.190 --> 02:36:49.620
Um

3316
02:37:06.370 --> 02:37:06.870
Is

3317
02:38:12.980 --> 02:38:13.929
And drums.

3318
02:38:14.709 --> 02:38:15.919
That would be a good idea.

3319
02:38:26.660 --> 02:38:26.860
I do.

3320
02:38:28.549 --> 02:38:28.669
No,

3321
02:38:28.709 --> 02:38:29.000
no

3322
02:43:43.730 --> 02:43:44.700
It's about 50.

3323
02:43:46.360 --> 02:43:46.929
We're working on it.

3324
02:43:48.959 --> 02:43:50.389
Use tabla for this.

3325
02:43:51.040 --> 02:43:51.839
Don't you know tabla,

3326
02:43:51.879 --> 02:43:52.509
any one of you?

3327
02:43:53.480 --> 02:43:55.379
You must learn at key.

3328
02:43:55.549 --> 02:43:56.309
It's very simple.

3329
02:43:57.589 --> 02:43:58.870
I was a drum.

3330
02:43:59.309 --> 02:44:00.059
We don't have

3331
02:44:00.599 --> 02:44:01.230
any drummer.

3332
02:44:02.629 --> 02:44:04.089
Do you have any drama among you?

3333
02:44:05.500 --> 02:44:05.519
All right,

3334
02:44:05.530 --> 02:44:05.580
it's all right.

3335
02:44:05.589 --> 02:44:05.620
Have you got?

3336
02:44:11.400 --> 02:44:12.309
You better get it not here but.

3337
02:44:17.790 --> 02:44:22.740
You should because what is wrong is the heartbeat of the sad.

3338
02:44:23.610 --> 02:44:24.480
The spirit

3339
02:44:24.679 --> 02:44:25.509
without a drum,

3340
02:44:25.559 --> 02:44:26.110
you see

3341
02:44:26.589 --> 02:44:28.120
that lacking is there.

3342
02:44:31.509 --> 02:44:33.730
It doesn't matter we or you can makes no difference.

3343
02:44:35.389 --> 02:44:36.519
So you'll get it next time.

3344
02:44:37.419 --> 02:44:37.849
Oh

3345
02:44:44.990 --> 02:44:45.000
Yeah

3346
02:45:15.790 --> 02:45:16.549
Oh

3347
02:45:18.290 --> 02:45:18.769
A

3348
02:45:20.950 --> 02:45:21.320
I

3349
02:45:28.730 --> 02:45:30.400
Were.

3350
02:45:33.009 --> 02:45:34.679
Our lives do.

3351
02:45:42.059 --> 02:45:42.070
I

3352
02:45:49.950 --> 02:45:49.959
Oh.

3353
02:46:04.389 --> 02:46:04.559
um

3354
02:46:17.070 --> 02:46:17.610
Uh

3355
02:46:32.849 --> 02:46:34.440
I we enjoy.

3356
02:46:38.269 --> 02:46:38.679
I

3357
02:46:42.530 --> 02:46:42.610
Uh.

3358
02:46:45.250 --> 02:46:45.759
I

3359
02:46:48.580 --> 02:46:48.919
The.

3360
02:46:57.370 --> 02:46:57.379
I

3361
02:47:01.139 --> 02:47:01.160
made my.

3362
02:47:03.120 --> 02:47:03.200
I

3363
02:47:10.320 --> 02:47:10.870
Uh,

3364
02:47:11.160 --> 02:47:11.730
first screw.

3365
02:47:19.849 --> 02:47:20.240
Kaka.

3366
02:47:31.209 --> 02:47:31.570
Um

3367
02:49:00.860 --> 02:49:01.129
I

3368
02:49:13.200 --> 02:49:13.209
Uh.

3369
02:49:15.509 --> 02:49:16.049
I

3370
02:49:18.570 --> 02:49:18.870
Uh

3371
02:49:44.480 --> 02:49:44.490
Uh

3372
02:50:37.440 --> 02:50:37.500
But

3373
02:50:40.290 --> 02:50:41.219
Ah.

3374
02:50:59.440 --> 02:50:59.450
Yeah.

3375
02:51:02.469 --> 02:51:02.480
OK.

3376
02:51:03.690 --> 02:51:04.459
I like rapes.

3377
02:51:06.030 --> 02:51:06.959
And then they

3378
02:51:07.250 --> 02:51:08.240
come to the shore.

3379
02:51:09.230 --> 02:51:10.150
Then the short

3380
02:51:10.950 --> 02:51:12.110
reacts and then the

3381
02:51:13.070 --> 02:51:15.429
2 waves and 4 waves and 10 wings.

3382
02:51:15.440 --> 02:51:16.110
It's beautiful,

3383
02:51:16.160 --> 02:51:16.889
isn't it.

3384
02:51:19.660 --> 02:51:20.169
Thank you.

3385
02:56:18.990 --> 02:56:19.000
I

3386
02:57:50.120 --> 02:57:50.139
I

3387
02:58:44.019 --> 02:58:44.160
Oh.

3388
02:59:09.879 --> 02:59:09.889
Oh

3389
03:00:11.990 --> 03:00:12.769
Beautiful,

3390
03:00:13.129 --> 03:00:13.769
very nice.

3391
03:00:14.679 --> 03:00:15.799
But you see,

3392
03:00:16.549 --> 03:00:18.509
some of the words I cannot catch.

3393
03:00:18.769 --> 03:00:20.849
I can feel the vibrations.

3394
03:00:32.299 --> 03:00:33.450
We should have more books,

3395
03:00:33.490 --> 03:00:34.080
I think.

3396
03:00:35.240 --> 03:00:36.230
Or they disappear,

3397
03:00:36.290 --> 03:00:36.679
I think.

3398
03:00:38.320 --> 03:00:38.639
See,

3399
03:00:38.719 --> 03:00:40.559
the books should be collected back.

3400
03:00:40.639 --> 03:00:41.690
That's the best way

3401
03:00:42.440 --> 03:00:44.719
and should be carried again for the seminars.

3402
03:00:44.879 --> 03:00:45.839
That would be better.

3403
03:00:48.360 --> 03:00:48.379
Huh?

3404
03:00:51.790 --> 03:00:52.360
It's all right.

3405
03:00:54.019 --> 03:00:54.660
If you want,

3406
03:00:54.709 --> 03:00:55.769
I would love to hear.

3407
03:01:01.089 --> 03:01:02.549
It's a very good one.

3408
03:01:04.530 --> 03:01:06.080
You should take a fast number.

3409
03:04:48.969 --> 03:04:48.980
I

3410
03:05:21.929 --> 03:05:22.160
Chris,

3411
03:05:22.209 --> 03:05:24.959
you have sent me some very beautiful poems.

3412
03:05:25.089 --> 03:05:26.440
Have you brought them with you?

3413
03:05:27.589 --> 03:05:28.269
From Bristol?

3414
03:05:35.639 --> 03:05:35.980
Let me see.

3415
03:05:41.950 --> 03:05:41.959
Yeah.

3416
03:05:44.809 --> 03:05:45.589
What's he say?

3417
03:05:47.980 --> 03:05:48.200
Uh,

3418
03:05:48.280 --> 03:05:48.929
where is Chris?

3419
03:05:51.070 --> 03:05:52.139
You sent me

3420
03:05:53.209 --> 03:05:53.549
You know,

3421
03:05:53.669 --> 03:05:56.780
I told them it was Chris Wakefield who wrote,

3422
03:05:57.150 --> 03:05:57.669
but they said,

3423
03:05:57.790 --> 03:05:57.919
no,

3424
03:05:58.070 --> 03:06:00.269
Chris Wakefield is not a writer.

3425
03:06:00.790 --> 03:06:02.070
Another Chris is a writer,

3426
03:06:02.269 --> 03:06:03.620
but I tell you there's a poet.

3427
03:06:05.339 --> 03:06:06.459
Poets are not writers.

3428
03:06:06.500 --> 03:06:07.099
That's the trouble.

3429
03:06:09.509 --> 03:06:09.519
Yeah

3430
03:06:11.759 --> 03:06:12.240
I'm glad to

3431
03:06:13.860 --> 03:06:13.870
Very

3432
03:06:14.480 --> 03:06:14.759
much,

3433
03:06:14.830 --> 03:06:15.990
but what about them?

3434
03:06:16.089 --> 03:06:16.769
Where are they?

3435
03:06:18.049 --> 03:06:18.419
I have

3436
03:06:19.830 --> 03:06:20.740
You haven't brought.

3437
03:06:23.580 --> 03:06:23.900
Oh,

3438
03:06:24.019 --> 03:06:24.900
I'll bring them tomorrow,

3439
03:06:24.940 --> 03:06:25.610
I think.

3440
03:06:26.209 --> 03:06:26.320
Beautiful,

3441
03:06:26.980 --> 03:06:28.059
but he's a real poet,

3442
03:06:28.540 --> 03:06:29.150
real poet C

3443
03:06:30.980 --> 03:06:32.379
poetry is so great.

3444
03:06:32.740 --> 03:06:33.019
You see,

3445
03:06:33.030 --> 03:06:33.530
now

3446
03:06:33.740 --> 03:06:35.379
I'll tell you one thing about poetry.

3447
03:06:36.969 --> 03:06:38.080
In the poetry,

3448
03:06:38.400 --> 03:06:39.509
poetry means

3449
03:06:39.759 --> 03:06:41.440
there has to be magic in the world.

3450
03:06:44.419 --> 03:06:44.969
Uh

3451
03:06:45.830 --> 03:06:46.740
When you

3452
03:06:47.349 --> 03:06:48.379
say something,

3453
03:06:48.870 --> 03:06:50.480
it must have a magic.

3454
03:06:53.309 --> 03:06:54.929
If there's no magic,

3455
03:06:55.540 --> 03:06:57.099
then it's not poetry.

3456
03:07:00.009 --> 03:07:01.669
Then the second thing is

3457
03:07:03.929 --> 03:07:04.330
That

3458
03:07:05.169 --> 03:07:06.250
It's precise.

3459
03:07:07.290 --> 03:07:08.389
It has to be precise.

3460
03:07:09.780 --> 03:07:10.820
It has to be

3461
03:07:11.730 --> 03:07:13.530
Small one sentences

3462
03:07:13.769 --> 03:07:17.490
like many propositions and all that are to be dropped off.

3463
03:07:18.490 --> 03:07:20.719
Adjectives to be dropped and you are allowed.

3464
03:07:22.299 --> 03:07:23.030
So many

3465
03:07:25.339 --> 03:07:26.769
Adverbs can be dropped out.

3466
03:07:27.599 --> 03:07:28.490
But mainly

3467
03:07:28.620 --> 03:07:30.330
what you can drop out are articles,

3468
03:07:30.500 --> 03:07:31.299
absolutely.

3469
03:07:35.049 --> 03:07:37.570
Third is that it must have Russia.

3470
03:07:38.780 --> 03:07:40.450
Rasa means the essences.

3471
03:07:40.900 --> 03:07:42.059
It must have the essence.

3472
03:07:43.089 --> 03:07:44.429
And the essences are

3473
03:07:44.790 --> 03:07:47.759
according to Indian science are 9 times.

3474
03:07:48.799 --> 03:07:49.950
Must have an essence.

3475
03:07:50.030 --> 03:07:52.230
Now this is the essence today is of Bhakti.

3476
03:07:55.860 --> 03:07:58.059
When you are singing of Bhakti and devotion.

3477
03:07:59.950 --> 03:08:00.679
Then

3478
03:08:01.049 --> 03:08:02.769
you have to use.

3479
03:08:03.639 --> 03:08:04.589
Words

3480
03:08:05.160 --> 03:08:06.669
extremely gentle words,

3481
03:08:06.679 --> 03:08:07.679
gentle words.

3482
03:08:09.339 --> 03:08:10.160
A

3483
03:08:10.410 --> 03:08:11.450
beautiful words.

3484
03:08:12.320 --> 03:08:13.530
Words that are delicate.

3485
03:08:15.299 --> 03:08:16.570
The words that

3486
03:08:17.419 --> 03:08:18.179
express.

3487
03:08:19.889 --> 03:08:20.740
devotion

3488
03:08:21.879 --> 03:08:21.919
Through

3489
03:08:22.669 --> 03:08:23.349
humility.

3490
03:08:24.160 --> 03:08:25.019
Words of humili.

3491
03:08:27.389 --> 03:08:30.870
Now what I see now with your compositions.

3492
03:08:31.809 --> 03:08:33.089
The two types

3493
03:08:33.400 --> 03:08:33.799
one.

3494
03:08:34.459 --> 03:08:35.849
is addressed to others.

3495
03:08:36.589 --> 03:08:37.000
I

3496
03:08:38.589 --> 03:08:39.669
Addressed to

3497
03:08:40.469 --> 03:08:40.480
Mm

3498
03:08:43.110 --> 03:08:45.530
In the others you have addressed some to the

3499
03:08:46.059 --> 03:08:47.740
other people who are not iris.

3500
03:08:48.599 --> 03:08:48.610
Some

3501
03:08:49.929 --> 03:08:51.740
your own surgies together.

3502
03:08:52.549 --> 03:08:54.500
And some are addressed to me.

3503
03:08:57.040 --> 03:09:00.459
So there are 3 types of compositions you.

3504
03:09:02.730 --> 03:09:04.650
Now when you are addressing to others.

3505
03:09:06.139 --> 03:09:07.700
It need not be that delicate.

3506
03:09:10.509 --> 03:09:11.259
And it is a,

3507
03:09:11.339 --> 03:09:11.589
come and see,

3508
03:09:13.620 --> 03:09:13.900
listen.

3509
03:09:15.129 --> 03:09:15.719
Look

3510
03:09:17.099 --> 03:09:18.200
This is what you should do.

3511
03:09:20.250 --> 03:09:22.080
In a gentle way they don't understand.

3512
03:09:23.440 --> 03:09:24.110
So

3513
03:09:24.219 --> 03:09:26.490
you have to use words which

3514
03:09:27.190 --> 03:09:27.940
are

3515
03:09:28.139 --> 03:09:29.500
sort of forcing them,

3516
03:09:29.860 --> 03:09:30.690
pushing into it.

3517
03:09:31.599 --> 03:09:32.740
What are you doing?

3518
03:09:34.320 --> 03:09:36.610
This is the poem same way written down

3519
03:09:36.919 --> 03:09:37.799
and a very good poem,

3520
03:09:37.879 --> 03:09:38.440
no doubt,

3521
03:09:38.559 --> 03:09:39.519
but in this poem,

3522
03:09:39.679 --> 03:09:41.309
whatever you have written this one.

3523
03:09:41.940 --> 03:09:43.160
It's good,

3524
03:09:43.330 --> 03:09:43.679
nice,

3525
03:09:43.730 --> 03:09:44.879
and everything fine,

3526
03:09:45.169 --> 03:09:47.759
but what I find is still a little bit

3527
03:09:48.330 --> 03:09:49.049
diplomacy.

3528
03:09:52.870 --> 03:09:56.660
Now if you say how many of you want to be saved today,

3529
03:09:56.910 --> 03:09:57.860
let's say all of us.

3530
03:09:58.629 --> 03:09:59.870
How do you count?

3531
03:09:59.980 --> 03:10:00.610
How do

3532
03:10:01.719 --> 03:10:02.320
Find out

3533
03:10:03.759 --> 03:10:04.139
So

3534
03:10:04.269 --> 03:10:05.299
the question should be.

3535
03:10:06.440 --> 03:10:06.450
As

3536
03:10:08.389 --> 03:10:09.419
Oh really?

3537
03:10:10.879 --> 03:10:12.110
In totality,

3538
03:10:14.099 --> 03:10:15.080
Actually,

3539
03:10:15.540 --> 03:10:16.500
honestly,

3540
03:10:16.900 --> 03:10:17.660
put these

3541
03:10:17.900 --> 03:10:19.309
adjectives in between

3542
03:10:19.620 --> 03:10:21.370
so that then people understand,

3543
03:10:21.459 --> 03:10:22.250
honestly,

3544
03:10:22.379 --> 03:10:23.250
are we honest?

3545
03:10:26.610 --> 03:10:28.669
But they'll also be we all want to see.

3546
03:10:29.320 --> 03:10:30.000
We are all seekers.

3547
03:10:30.040 --> 03:10:30.519
You are seekers,

3548
03:10:30.559 --> 03:10:31.230
we are seekers.

3549
03:10:31.400 --> 03:10:32.379
Why should we run after.

3550
03:10:33.750 --> 03:10:34.269
All right,

3551
03:10:34.549 --> 03:10:35.740
so honestly.

3552
03:10:36.750 --> 03:10:38.799
And all those things sort of see,

3553
03:10:38.860 --> 03:10:39.650
make it

3554
03:10:41.940 --> 03:10:42.849
look more.

3555
03:10:45.040 --> 03:10:45.860
Objective

3556
03:10:47.110 --> 03:10:48.089
To fix them,

3557
03:10:48.209 --> 03:10:49.679
you have to hem them up,

3558
03:10:50.040 --> 03:10:52.599
otherwise they'll slip up in whatever you're seeing,

3559
03:10:52.650 --> 03:10:54.580
it should be such that they are.

3560
03:10:55.669 --> 03:10:56.790
Pushed into a point,

3561
03:10:56.830 --> 03:10:58.419
they have no escapes left.

3562
03:10:59.309 --> 03:11:01.759
So when you write down next time,

3563
03:11:01.929 --> 03:11:02.849
it's very good poetry,

3564
03:11:02.929 --> 03:11:03.599
no doubt,

3565
03:11:03.809 --> 03:11:04.240
but

3566
03:11:05.169 --> 03:11:05.820
correct it

3567
03:11:06.089 --> 03:11:07.440
when you address to others,

3568
03:11:07.650 --> 03:11:09.809
see that they have no escape.

3569
03:11:14.790 --> 03:11:15.769
That they cannot budge up,

3570
03:11:17.299 --> 03:11:17.320
all right.

3571
03:11:17.889 --> 03:11:18.679
You are a scholar,

3572
03:11:18.799 --> 03:11:20.400
so I must ask your permission.

3573
03:11:24.700 --> 03:11:25.269
Now,

3574
03:11:25.469 --> 03:11:26.889
the second one is

3575
03:11:27.299 --> 03:11:27.709
when

3576
03:11:27.820 --> 03:11:29.809
we are singing among ourselves.

3577
03:11:30.599 --> 03:11:31.150
Now

3578
03:11:31.379 --> 03:11:32.540
the thing that is joy,

3579
03:11:32.580 --> 03:11:33.780
joy is a very good one.

3580
03:11:35.660 --> 03:11:36.169
But

3581
03:11:37.669 --> 03:11:40.040
We are not addressing to folk people.

3582
03:11:40.230 --> 03:11:40.990
That's the point.

3583
03:11:42.610 --> 03:11:44.639
We are adjusting to intellectuals.

3584
03:11:46.339 --> 03:11:47.610
So that's a good one

3585
03:11:47.889 --> 03:11:49.339
between ourselves when we sing.

3586
03:11:49.849 --> 03:11:54.009
We have to adjust to the intellectuals so we can challenge relatives.

3587
03:11:55.610 --> 03:11:57.719
So what have they got with the intellect,

3588
03:11:57.769 --> 03:11:58.639
what did I get?

3589
03:11:58.799 --> 03:11:59.280
If they say,

3590
03:11:59.320 --> 03:12:00.269
what did I get?

3591
03:12:00.559 --> 03:12:01.759
All these barren things,

3592
03:12:01.879 --> 03:12:02.830
useless things,

3593
03:12:03.070 --> 03:12:03.490
saw nothing,

3594
03:12:03.679 --> 03:12:04.599
not a single fred.

3595
03:12:05.309 --> 03:12:06.650
And then come down.

3596
03:12:07.639 --> 03:12:08.919
What I got in search of.

3597
03:12:09.769 --> 03:12:10.379
This

3598
03:12:10.809 --> 03:12:11.519
relative.

3599
03:12:12.980 --> 03:12:14.450
Description should be given,

3600
03:12:14.599 --> 03:12:16.719
so I hope some of you will write poetry on that.

3601
03:12:18.730 --> 03:12:21.240
The third one is what Wakefield has done.

3602
03:12:22.389 --> 03:12:23.179
Is

3603
03:12:23.660 --> 03:12:24.580
my description.

3604
03:12:25.379 --> 03:12:26.530
And devotion to

3605
03:12:27.160 --> 03:12:28.269
It's come out very well,

3606
03:12:28.309 --> 03:12:28.870
I must say.

3607
03:12:30.459 --> 03:12:32.139
I think that's the highest one can do.

3608
03:12:33.240 --> 03:12:34.110
As the best,

3609
03:12:34.240 --> 03:12:35.669
but still we need all this.

3610
03:12:35.799 --> 03:12:36.519
We have to have.

3611
03:12:37.370 --> 03:12:39.040
Otherwise we cannot manage,

3612
03:12:39.610 --> 03:12:41.320
so that's a part of it,

3613
03:12:41.599 --> 03:12:43.280
but the essence of it,

3614
03:12:43.490 --> 03:12:44.209
the praise.

3615
03:12:47.299 --> 03:12:47.309
Where

3616
03:12:51.879 --> 03:12:53.450
Many great poets,

3617
03:12:53.599 --> 03:12:55.080
many great writers.

3618
03:12:56.330 --> 03:12:58.839
Many great saints and incarnations

3619
03:12:59.570 --> 03:13:02.129
have aspired to sing the praise of the mother.

3620
03:13:03.379 --> 03:13:04.530
It's a great aspiration.

3621
03:13:06.519 --> 03:13:08.030
Like Markande I did that.

3622
03:13:08.599 --> 03:13:11.030
Today also we did it after 14,000 years,

3623
03:13:11.839 --> 03:13:12.200
then.

3624
03:13:13.370 --> 03:13:15.049
Adi Shankarach did that.

3625
03:13:16.150 --> 03:13:17.639
poetry of that level

3626
03:13:18.070 --> 03:13:19.019
should come on.

3627
03:13:19.389 --> 03:13:22.309
I would request you to read those poems,

3628
03:13:22.349 --> 03:13:24.259
poetry of those people

3629
03:13:24.509 --> 03:13:27.120
who compose such high class books

3630
03:13:27.509 --> 03:13:29.660
that not a word can be changed,

3631
03:13:30.230 --> 03:13:31.580
not to be added,

3632
03:13:31.750 --> 03:13:33.549
and that's how you try to perfect it.

3633
03:13:34.969 --> 03:13:35.969
Try to perfect it.

3634
03:13:36.070 --> 03:13:37.049
When you have written it down,

3635
03:13:37.129 --> 03:13:37.690
sit down,

3636
03:13:37.969 --> 03:13:39.049
think over it again,

3637
03:13:39.290 --> 03:13:40.839
try to bring in better words.

3638
03:13:41.250 --> 03:13:42.480
Try to put better words,

3639
03:13:42.610 --> 03:13:43.440
so you

3640
03:13:43.730 --> 03:13:45.570
actually make it a perfect poetry,

3641
03:13:45.849 --> 03:13:47.059
a perfect setting.

3642
03:13:47.610 --> 03:13:48.250
That's it.

3643
03:13:50.219 --> 03:13:52.179
But a poet is a poet born poet.

3644
03:13:52.240 --> 03:13:54.040
It's a thing that is born,

3645
03:13:54.129 --> 03:13:56.879
and even after so many people suddenly become poets

3646
03:13:57.169 --> 03:13:58.240
like Dhamla never used to,

3647
03:13:58.250 --> 03:13:58.969
he's an engineer,

3648
03:13:59.049 --> 03:13:59.730
never used to write,

3649
03:13:59.769 --> 03:14:00.839
but wrote very well.

3650
03:14:01.830 --> 03:14:02.410
Very beautiful.

3651
03:14:02.509 --> 03:14:03.660
His poems are very good,

3652
03:14:03.669 --> 03:14:05.190
even now I think he's very good,

3653
03:14:05.209 --> 03:14:08.349
but there was another fellow of Kade who did beautiful writing.

3654
03:14:08.469 --> 03:14:10.230
I don't know where are his poems last,

3655
03:14:10.309 --> 03:14:11.190
but they are somewhere.

3656
03:14:12.030 --> 03:14:12.980
And

3657
03:14:13.410 --> 03:14:15.719
such tremendous things he has written.

3658
03:14:15.950 --> 03:14:16.919
I was amazed,

3659
03:14:17.190 --> 03:14:17.530
but he said,

3660
03:14:17.580 --> 03:14:18.150
I don't write.

3661
03:14:18.330 --> 03:14:19.410
Saraswati is writing.

3662
03:14:20.700 --> 03:14:21.250
So

3663
03:14:21.440 --> 03:14:22.120
for that,

3664
03:14:22.200 --> 03:14:22.790
you see,

3665
03:14:24.599 --> 03:14:25.280
The

3666
03:14:25.549 --> 03:14:26.849
spontaneity is alright,

3667
03:14:27.129 --> 03:14:29.250
but you have to have the technique to write.

3668
03:14:30.370 --> 03:14:33.480
The technique must be there and the spontaneity I look after it.

3669
03:14:34.030 --> 03:14:37.509
So you have to also develop a little bit of technique how to write it down

3670
03:14:38.110 --> 03:14:40.469
in these three categories you write of different.

3671
03:14:41.200 --> 03:14:42.900
So when you write about your mother,

3672
03:14:43.929 --> 03:14:45.969
You have to be absolutely sure.

3673
03:14:48.190 --> 03:14:49.309
Absolutely

3674
03:14:49.610 --> 03:14:50.009
one.

3675
03:14:51.049 --> 03:14:53.049
And absolutely surrendered.

3676
03:14:57.000 --> 03:14:59.400
So the whole thing can be an epic,

3677
03:14:59.419 --> 03:15:00.759
absolutely.

3678
03:15:02.429 --> 03:15:07.429
The topmost thing that one can do in poetry is to write the places of the.

3679
03:15:09.540 --> 03:15:10.570
That's the highest.

3680
03:15:11.099 --> 03:15:12.860
So all the poetry is very nice,

3681
03:15:13.019 --> 03:15:13.929
comes out of

3682
03:15:14.259 --> 03:15:15.790
very generous heart and

3683
03:15:16.379 --> 03:15:17.049
also.

3684
03:15:17.860 --> 03:15:19.330
Very great hearts,

3685
03:15:19.459 --> 03:15:21.410
but it has to have a technique.

3686
03:15:22.089 --> 03:15:23.309
And the technique

3687
03:15:23.959 --> 03:15:24.429
is

3688
03:15:24.959 --> 03:15:27.389
to be a little bit understood in a divine way.

3689
03:15:28.040 --> 03:15:29.870
That what makes it

3690
03:15:32.320 --> 03:15:32.330
Uh

3691
03:15:34.929 --> 03:15:35.639
thing that

3692
03:15:35.750 --> 03:15:37.019
throbs in your heart.

3693
03:15:41.389 --> 03:15:42.259
So

3694
03:15:42.509 --> 03:15:46.309
that you will see yourself that will throbbing around.

3695
03:15:48.089 --> 03:15:49.669
If you are detached about it,

3696
03:15:49.709 --> 03:15:50.580
you will do it,

3697
03:15:50.690 --> 03:15:51.629
and you do it very well.

3698
03:15:51.669 --> 03:15:53.370
I was so happy about Chris.

3699
03:15:53.750 --> 03:15:56.780
I told them it was Chris Wakefield who has written to me.

3700
03:15:57.110 --> 03:15:59.870
They thought that it is Chris who has done this from Bristol,

3701
03:15:59.950 --> 03:16:00.230
so I said,

3702
03:16:00.400 --> 03:16:00.549
all right,

3703
03:16:00.589 --> 03:16:03.030
let me ask first of all Chris from Bristol.

3704
03:16:04.580 --> 03:16:05.179
Beautiful,

3705
03:16:05.700 --> 03:16:06.669
beautifully done.

3706
03:16:07.400 --> 03:16:07.419
All right.

3707
03:16:08.709 --> 03:16:09.080
So,

3708
03:16:09.230 --> 03:16:13.820
best of luck to you for all these good poems and poetry that you have done,

3709
03:16:14.150 --> 03:16:16.669
and all these pieces are extremely beautiful.

3710
03:16:17.500 --> 03:16:19.259
But we have to perfect it,

3711
03:16:19.570 --> 03:16:21.250
make it better and better.

3712
03:16:22.660 --> 03:16:23.219
I

3713
03:16:24.160 --> 03:16:25.599
In tune with

3714
03:16:25.769 --> 03:16:27.160
divine vibrations.

3715
03:16:28.000 --> 03:16:29.629
So you should say vibrations also.

3716
03:16:30.940 --> 03:16:32.929
What gives you the best vibration?

3717
03:16:33.889 --> 03:16:34.730
Tunes

3718
03:16:34.919 --> 03:16:35.599
could be simple,

3719
03:16:35.759 --> 03:16:36.950
could be complicated,

3720
03:16:37.120 --> 03:16:38.230
could be magical,

3721
03:16:38.480 --> 03:16:39.360
could be anything,

3722
03:16:39.839 --> 03:16:41.639
but the poetry must.

3723
03:16:43.669 --> 03:16:44.769
Not narrate

3724
03:16:46.219 --> 03:16:48.030
But create magic.

3725
03:16:53.639 --> 03:16:57.480
Sanskriti said when there's Jama car and there's a magic.

3726
03:16:58.429 --> 03:16:58.440
Ja

3727
03:17:01.030 --> 03:17:02.490
The light of the magic.

3728
03:17:02.620 --> 03:17:04.490
When there is a light of the magic,

3729
03:17:04.860 --> 03:17:08.299
then you should call it the poet Ras Makawe.

3730
03:17:09.299 --> 03:17:10.179
When there is Rasad,

3731
03:17:10.219 --> 03:17:10.969
then there is Kawe.

3732
03:17:11.160 --> 03:17:11.419
There is

3733
03:17:11.820 --> 03:17:12.370
otherwise no.

3734
03:17:12.459 --> 03:17:13.459
Without ras there is no.

3735
03:17:18.799 --> 03:17:22.280
Now this is the part where the composer is concerned now

3736
03:17:22.280 --> 03:17:24.589
for the part of the ones who have to sing.

3737
03:17:25.790 --> 03:17:27.410
To sing from your heart.

3738
03:17:30.259 --> 03:17:33.019
Knowing before whom you are seen from your.

3739
03:17:33.879 --> 03:17:35.530
You're not singing for yourself,

3740
03:17:35.709 --> 03:17:37.059
you're singing for me,

3741
03:17:37.490 --> 03:17:38.980
singing for the whole universe.

3742
03:17:39.190 --> 03:17:41.379
Say from your heart

3743
03:17:41.870 --> 03:17:43.269
knowing that I'm before you,

3744
03:17:43.950 --> 03:17:44.440
understanding.

3745
03:17:47.820 --> 03:17:48.570
Secondly,

3746
03:17:48.759 --> 03:17:50.309
you must have the technique

3747
03:17:50.780 --> 03:17:51.769
of singing it.

3748
03:17:51.900 --> 03:17:52.690
It's very important.

3749
03:17:53.459 --> 03:17:55.849
All these techniques are built in through tradition

3750
03:17:56.139 --> 03:17:58.490
by understanding whatever is not.

3751
03:17:59.269 --> 03:18:00.750
Proper is thrown away.

3752
03:18:02.860 --> 03:18:05.469
It should not be that one line close long,

3753
03:18:05.730 --> 03:18:07.230
another line comes short long.

3754
03:18:08.120 --> 03:18:08.389
Should be,

3755
03:18:08.429 --> 03:18:10.679
there should be a proper technique about it,

3756
03:18:10.809 --> 03:18:11.759
how to do it.

3757
03:18:12.450 --> 03:18:12.599
See,

3758
03:18:12.650 --> 03:18:15.250
like a free verse business is no good for surgery.

3759
03:18:16.570 --> 03:18:18.679
So that technique you have to know

3760
03:18:19.169 --> 03:18:20.160
how to sing it

3761
03:18:20.450 --> 03:18:21.370
without the music,

3762
03:18:21.490 --> 03:18:26.349
but the drum is an essential part of every music because that is the part

3763
03:18:26.650 --> 03:18:28.540
where Ahata is playing.

3764
03:18:29.849 --> 03:18:30.969
So in sound,

3765
03:18:31.250 --> 03:18:32.459
drum has to be

3766
03:18:33.179 --> 03:18:33.940
when you are singing,

3767
03:18:34.019 --> 03:18:37.250
there has to be drum as well as other accompaniments,

3768
03:18:37.580 --> 03:18:39.330
any accompaniments you have,

3769
03:18:39.580 --> 03:18:41.450
but drum is an essential part

3770
03:18:41.620 --> 03:18:42.540
that has to be there.

3771
03:18:43.389 --> 03:18:45.889
And the whole thing should be on a rhythmic

3772
03:18:46.830 --> 03:18:47.339
understanding

3773
03:18:47.669 --> 03:18:48.150
that you see,

3774
03:18:48.309 --> 03:18:50.709
you have seen how Indians have rhythmic understanding,

3775
03:18:50.750 --> 03:18:51.580
you see,

3776
03:18:51.830 --> 03:18:53.150
they cut it into 3 halves,

3777
03:18:53.190 --> 03:18:53.790
4 halves,

3778
03:18:53.830 --> 03:18:55.910
they bring it back and how they cut it,

3779
03:18:55.990 --> 03:18:56.820
how they go off.

3780
03:18:57.230 --> 03:18:58.299
It's really

3781
03:18:58.830 --> 03:18:59.700
too much,

3782
03:19:00.269 --> 03:19:01.780
but you can compose.

3783
03:19:02.980 --> 03:19:04.830
To a great extent on those lines.

3784
03:19:05.750 --> 03:19:06.469
And

3785
03:19:08.990 --> 03:19:10.870
That technique has to come

3786
03:19:11.290 --> 03:19:12.410
properly understood.

3787
03:19:13.820 --> 03:19:17.049
Like singing in parts itself it's a big technique,

3788
03:19:17.459 --> 03:19:19.929
and one has to understand how you do it,

3789
03:19:20.259 --> 03:19:22.950
but there are so many other things which you have is stremor,

3790
03:19:23.099 --> 03:19:24.250
you have yodelling.

3791
03:19:24.459 --> 03:19:26.860
I don't know if you use those things or not at all,

3792
03:19:26.940 --> 03:19:28.150
but you should use in

3793
03:19:28.500 --> 03:19:29.089
music.

3794
03:19:29.339 --> 03:19:32.889
There are so many things you have all of these things you should use,

3795
03:19:33.139 --> 03:19:34.370
which helps a lot

3796
03:19:34.700 --> 03:19:35.169
in

3797
03:19:35.339 --> 03:19:35.780
music.

3798
03:19:35.900 --> 03:19:37.540
I don't know much about Western music,

3799
03:19:37.549 --> 03:19:38.110
but.

3800
03:19:41.320 --> 03:19:42.030
And these things,

3801
03:19:42.070 --> 03:19:42.919
if you use,

3802
03:19:43.110 --> 03:19:45.429
it will help a lot to bring out

3803
03:19:45.709 --> 03:19:47.620
the music in its proper way,

3804
03:19:47.950 --> 03:19:50.589
and I don't know if you have any soprano singers also.

3805
03:19:52.209 --> 03:19:53.530
And the way they sing

3806
03:19:53.839 --> 03:19:54.540
beautifully,

3807
03:19:54.669 --> 03:19:55.879
you have to have some of them.

3808
03:19:56.030 --> 03:19:58.879
So in between a soprano singer can sing in between,

3809
03:19:59.030 --> 03:20:02.190
but should be made a proper sensible.

3810
03:20:03.339 --> 03:20:05.190
organised thing

3811
03:20:05.809 --> 03:20:07.480
because to the public.

3812
03:20:08.559 --> 03:20:08.570
Uh,

3813
03:20:10.320 --> 03:20:11.820
they can't understand this.

3814
03:20:12.190 --> 03:20:14.669
And another could be hippie style of music.

3815
03:20:14.750 --> 03:20:16.030
I don't mind even that.

3816
03:20:16.269 --> 03:20:17.059
It's all right,

3817
03:20:17.269 --> 03:20:19.179
but if it is sung with the heart,

3818
03:20:19.269 --> 03:20:20.389
with that devotion,

3819
03:20:20.830 --> 03:20:21.860
like a

3820
03:20:22.309 --> 03:20:23.459
folklore,

3821
03:20:23.750 --> 03:20:24.860
would be very good,

3822
03:20:25.030 --> 03:20:27.179
but should be so fast and so

3823
03:20:27.469 --> 03:20:29.540
accurate and so clear cut

3824
03:20:30.070 --> 03:20:32.139
that people should feel this is something so great.

3825
03:20:32.190 --> 03:20:33.549
So you can have all varieties,

3826
03:20:33.559 --> 03:20:35.459
you can have classical style,

3827
03:20:35.629 --> 03:20:37.540
and you can have this yodelling style.

3828
03:20:39.559 --> 03:20:39.570
Yeah

3829
03:20:41.549 --> 03:20:45.339
And then you can have many styles you can sing like that.

3830
03:20:45.889 --> 03:20:45.900
OK,

3831
03:20:45.910 --> 03:20:48.780
we do have like for the tapes you have

3832
03:20:48.780 --> 03:20:53.330
heard now is we have two tapes which are absolutely

3833
03:20:54.299 --> 03:20:55.009
folk.

3834
03:20:55.259 --> 03:20:57.629
I don't know if you have noticed it's a very fast number.

3835
03:20:57.820 --> 03:20:58.879
The first one is,

3836
03:20:59.219 --> 03:21:00.690
and the first one is

3837
03:21:01.059 --> 03:21:01.570
about

3838
03:21:01.860 --> 03:21:04.049
how the abstract

3839
03:21:04.339 --> 03:21:05.410
without form,

3840
03:21:05.740 --> 03:21:06.769
the formless

3841
03:21:07.099 --> 03:21:07.969
has become,

3842
03:21:08.059 --> 03:21:10.580
has appeared now into form.

3843
03:21:10.969 --> 03:21:11.669
The first one,

3844
03:21:12.040 --> 03:21:13.389
it's such a fast number.

3845
03:21:13.639 --> 03:21:14.059
So

3846
03:21:14.360 --> 03:21:15.360
I hope you have heard it.

3847
03:21:15.480 --> 03:21:16.790
Have you heard it clearly?

3848
03:21:16.959 --> 03:21:18.589
I would like to hear once again.

3849
03:21:18.759 --> 03:21:19.839
Just play the first one.

3850
03:21:21.009 --> 03:21:23.940
Nirguni Nirguni is without any.

3851
03:21:24.490 --> 03:21:25.500
So now when you see,

3852
03:21:25.570 --> 03:21:26.360
hear that,

3853
03:21:26.650 --> 03:21:27.450
try to grasp it.

3854
03:21:27.490 --> 03:21:28.620
I think in music.

3855
03:21:30.099 --> 03:21:31.799
Indians are very well off,

3856
03:21:32.049 --> 03:21:33.040
no doubt about it.

3857
03:21:33.450 --> 03:21:33.690
I mean,

3858
03:21:33.849 --> 03:21:34.650
no doubt about it.

3859
03:21:34.690 --> 03:21:36.980
They're very well off and the rhythms and all that,

3860
03:21:37.009 --> 03:21:38.209
they're very systematic.

3861
03:21:38.290 --> 03:21:39.120
They know a lot.

3862
03:21:39.450 --> 03:21:40.559
So it's a very good thing,

3863
03:21:40.660 --> 03:21:42.450
but now you listen to the first one.

3864
03:21:43.740 --> 03:21:46.009
The one you had just now out of that,

3865
03:21:46.019 --> 03:21:46.650
the first one.

3866
03:22:00.200 --> 03:22:01.219
Now you see the

3867
03:22:01.440 --> 03:22:02.669
whole thing out there was,

3868
03:22:03.120 --> 03:22:03.589
the

3869
03:22:04.269 --> 03:22:04.799
rhythm.

3870
03:22:05.580 --> 03:22:06.589
The music,

3871
03:22:06.839 --> 03:22:08.070
the poetry,

3872
03:22:08.759 --> 03:22:10.919
and the combination of everyone,

3873
03:22:11.160 --> 03:22:12.000
how they worked it out.

3874
03:22:12.080 --> 03:22:13.209
Just see this point

3875
03:22:13.559 --> 03:22:15.160
for about 2 or 3 minutes it will play.

3876
03:22:18.269 --> 03:22:19.339
And it's a folklore.

3877
03:22:19.419 --> 03:22:20.120
It's a folk thing.

3878
03:22:20.179 --> 03:22:21.580
It's an extremely fast.

3879
03:22:22.480 --> 03:22:23.639
A fast music,

3880
03:22:23.679 --> 03:22:24.389
folklore,

3881
03:22:24.400 --> 03:22:27.080
absolutely what you can call the top speed,

3882
03:22:27.089 --> 03:22:27.839
it starts.

3883
03:22:29.910 --> 03:22:31.059
So they said Nirguni,

3884
03:22:31.169 --> 03:22:34.410
the one who who was without any gunnas,

3885
03:22:34.570 --> 03:22:35.639
without any form,

3886
03:22:35.910 --> 03:22:38.080
has appeared now on the scene

3887
03:22:38.410 --> 03:22:38.790
to

3888
03:22:39.490 --> 03:22:40.580
give us realisation.

3889
03:22:41.860 --> 03:22:42.809
It's such a speed,

3890
03:22:42.849 --> 03:22:45.089
but it conveys and communicates the thing.

3891
03:22:50.360 --> 03:22:54.030
Just after when they have said that this is the thing.

3892
03:22:59.740 --> 03:23:04.769
Only listen to one and you just put a little forward.

3893
03:23:05.419 --> 03:23:05.509
So

3894
03:23:07.019 --> 03:23:08.519
A little forward than this.

3895
03:23:11.740 --> 03:23:12.370
But that's OK.

3896
03:23:13.480 --> 03:23:13.509
You started it.

3897
03:23:15.190 --> 03:23:15.309
No,

3898
03:23:15.389 --> 03:23:15.429
no,

3899
03:23:15.549 --> 03:23:16.030
not this one,

3900
03:23:16.070 --> 03:23:16.900
the other way.

3901
03:23:17.389 --> 03:23:18.469
It's on the other side.

3902
03:23:20.629 --> 03:23:21.610
On the other side

3903
03:23:31.910 --> 03:23:32.849
That's a folklore,

3904
03:23:32.860 --> 03:23:33.879
just an ordinary.

3905
03:23:34.019 --> 03:23:36.129
Now you also catch hold of your folklores here.

3906
03:23:36.230 --> 03:23:37.209
It must be very fast,

3907
03:23:37.339 --> 03:23:38.209
I'm sure.

3908
03:23:38.620 --> 03:23:42.049
Get hold of your folklores and their tunes and set into that.

3909
03:23:42.339 --> 03:23:43.750
That's the best way to do it.

3910
03:23:44.019 --> 03:23:45.330
They can be very fast.

3911
03:23:46.250 --> 03:23:49.480
This is just a folklore and a folk style called lani.

3912
03:23:50.500 --> 03:23:51.660
And that it is best,

3913
03:23:51.709 --> 03:23:52.580
it's very fast.

3914
03:23:56.000 --> 03:23:57.259
This is the first one.

3915
03:23:58.099 --> 03:23:58.769
In this one,

3916
03:23:58.780 --> 03:23:59.370
the first.

3917
03:24:04.019 --> 03:24:05.370
Now just listen to it.

3918
03:24:06.030 --> 03:24:08.019
And you will understand what I'm saying.

3919
03:24:08.769 --> 03:24:10.160
That's an example I feel.

3920
03:24:11.679 --> 03:24:12.230
And this

3921
03:24:13.110 --> 03:24:14.549
poetry is very high class,

3922
03:24:14.830 --> 03:24:16.030
very high class poetry.

3923
03:24:17.190 --> 03:24:18.610
The style is

3924
03:24:18.950 --> 03:24:19.580
folk.

3925
03:24:50.870 --> 03:24:52.700
It's the first one and then you stop it.

3926
03:24:52.740 --> 03:24:53.099
That's all.

3927
03:25:04.259 --> 03:25:05.620
You see that the

3928
03:25:05.889 --> 03:25:07.000
one you brought

3929
03:25:07.250 --> 03:25:09.530
is no good compared to what he was really.

3930
03:25:10.429 --> 03:25:12.700
Then that's nothing,

3931
03:25:12.780 --> 03:25:14.019
nothing compared to that

3932
03:25:14.219 --> 03:25:15.870
that day he was in a different mood I think.

3933
03:25:21.620 --> 03:25:22.629
A little louder

3934
03:25:36.769 --> 03:25:36.910
I

3935
03:25:41.320 --> 03:25:41.379
I

3936
03:25:43.669 --> 03:25:43.830
I

3937
03:25:49.929 --> 03:25:49.950
I

3938
03:25:52.940 --> 03:25:53.490
I.

3939
03:26:00.490 --> 03:26:01.089
That's

3940
03:26:01.969 --> 03:26:02.089
I

3941
03:26:06.719 --> 03:26:06.730
I

3942
03:26:12.580 --> 03:26:12.900
from.

3943
03:26:14.089 --> 03:26:15.509
We ask for yoga from

3944
03:26:28.230 --> 03:26:29.209
How fast it

3945
03:26:30.179 --> 03:26:31.570
Politicians can understand.

3946
03:26:43.379 --> 03:26:44.240
the dualism.

3947
03:26:45.099 --> 03:26:48.969
I land is too tight.

3948
03:26:51.500 --> 03:26:54.089
And what will I have is the

3949
03:26:55.570 --> 03:26:55.820
that

3950
03:26:57.679 --> 03:26:58.919
Enlightened awareness.

3951
03:27:06.599 --> 03:27:08.080
It's a it's a colloquial.

3952
03:27:09.589 --> 03:27:11.860
It's a village on globe.

3953
03:27:12.580 --> 03:27:14.129
I'll ask her for yoga.

3954
03:27:17.519 --> 03:27:18.690
Now go change the toy.

3955
03:27:30.820 --> 03:27:32.629
99 nights I will spend in her heart.

3956
03:27:35.250 --> 03:27:35.259
OK.

3957
03:27:45.620 --> 03:27:47.230
My father-in-law,

3958
03:27:47.620 --> 03:27:48.650
he's there.

3959
03:27:49.519 --> 03:27:50.780
He's the vanity.

3960
03:27:51.070 --> 03:27:51.669
I'll give him up.

3961
03:27:52.330 --> 03:27:52.559
Oh

3962
03:28:04.549 --> 03:28:05.740
It's a woman's song.

3963
03:28:06.599 --> 03:28:07.459
She says

3964
03:28:07.709 --> 03:28:10.179
my father-in-law is the vanity

3965
03:28:10.549 --> 03:28:12.860
and my husband is the ego.

3966
03:28:13.009 --> 03:28:13.830
I'll give them up.

3967
03:28:17.410 --> 03:28:18.290
What is it?

3968
03:28:22.570 --> 03:28:24.910
is the enlightened awareness.

3969
03:28:24.959 --> 03:28:26.870
I'll make my flowers

3970
03:28:27.519 --> 03:28:28.429
of that.

3971
03:28:31.250 --> 03:28:31.889
Gina.

3972
03:28:34.330 --> 03:28:34.469
I

3973
03:28:38.969 --> 03:28:41.160
And that's how I'll kill the Mahara.

3974
03:28:46.009 --> 03:28:49.410
All all those which are bad conditioning me,

3975
03:28:49.799 --> 03:28:50.830
I'll take them

3976
03:28:51.559 --> 03:28:53.360
as bad eyes from my mother.

3977
03:29:15.339 --> 03:29:15.349
Yeah.

3978
03:29:18.389 --> 03:29:19.429
What was supposed to.

3979
03:29:28.110 --> 03:29:31.580
I become unattached to everything.

3980
03:29:36.419 --> 03:29:38.719
I've left my husband.

3981
03:29:41.730 --> 03:29:41.740
I

3982
03:29:45.169 --> 03:29:46.559
Lust and anger.

3983
03:29:53.080 --> 03:29:55.120
That my relations have left them behind.

3984
03:30:05.139 --> 03:30:05.150
Oh.

3985
03:30:17.879 --> 03:30:18.320
I

3986
03:30:18.940 --> 03:30:23.570
I asked the mother for her yoga and I've bought it and kept it with me.

3987
03:30:28.500 --> 03:30:28.559
I

3988
03:30:30.709 --> 03:30:31.200
Then

3989
03:30:31.330 --> 03:30:33.700
I have gave her back by

3990
03:30:34.169 --> 03:30:35.169
spreading it all over.

3991
03:30:46.299 --> 03:30:50.120
I got rid of a life and death cycle

3992
03:30:50.490 --> 03:30:51.929
by giving all that

3993
03:30:52.200 --> 03:30:52.919
back.

3994
03:31:01.889 --> 03:31:03.990
The village style is absolutely.

3995
03:31:14.650 --> 03:31:15.830
It's a very,

3996
03:31:15.950 --> 03:31:15.959
very

3997
03:31:16.919 --> 03:31:16.929
A

3998
03:31:17.709 --> 03:31:20.240
fast song with very deep,

3999
03:31:20.629 --> 03:31:21.019
uh,

4000
03:31:21.030 --> 03:31:22.389
penetrating

4001
03:31:22.950 --> 03:31:23.309
poetry,

4002
03:31:23.589 --> 03:31:24.429
very penetrating.

4003
03:31:25.330 --> 03:31:27.610
And this is how one should understand

4004
03:31:28.200 --> 03:31:30.240
that there has to be yoga words.

4005
03:31:30.280 --> 03:31:31.070
There has to be

4006
03:31:31.799 --> 03:31:33.280
yoga ideas.

4007
03:31:33.320 --> 03:31:34.679
There has to be all these things.

4008
03:31:34.719 --> 03:31:35.509
Otherwise

4009
03:31:36.240 --> 03:31:37.509
we have not achieved it.

4010
03:31:37.639 --> 03:31:38.169
Even

4011
03:31:38.740 --> 03:31:40.799
his songs are like that.

4012
03:31:41.080 --> 03:31:44.549
Like he says Aga chakra on the Agachakra I've got,

4013
03:31:45.120 --> 03:31:46.309
uh,

4014
03:31:46.320 --> 03:31:46.969
a bundle,

4015
03:31:47.900 --> 03:31:49.179
bundle of love.

4016
03:31:49.679 --> 03:31:52.000
So why have you stopped now open it my sister.

4017
03:31:53.240 --> 03:31:53.799
Oh mother,

4018
03:31:53.910 --> 03:31:54.509
open my so.

4019
03:31:55.309 --> 03:31:57.889
Let's talk of these things in our poetry.

4020
03:31:58.349 --> 03:32:01.540
In English language you must talk of these things in this way.

4021
03:32:01.790 --> 03:32:05.450
I was happy in the previous one you talked of Sara and all that.

4022
03:32:05.830 --> 03:32:08.059
Let people know that you know more than them

4023
03:32:08.269 --> 03:32:10.910
and that you have a deeper understanding of everything.

4024
03:32:13.400 --> 03:32:14.940
That's how it should be brought in.

4025
03:32:16.400 --> 03:32:18.120
So we have had very nice music.

4026
03:32:18.240 --> 03:32:19.230
Thank you very much.

4027
03:32:19.519 --> 03:32:20.269
Tomorrow again,

4028
03:32:20.360 --> 03:32:22.280
we are going to have the music of the Puja.

4029
03:32:23.990 --> 03:32:25.250
So may God bless you.

4030
03:32:25.339 --> 03:32:27.360
Hope to see you again tomorrow morning,

4031
03:32:27.450 --> 03:32:27.849
all right?

4032
03:32:36.230 --> 03:32:39.040
that recording when you were there because I know

4033
03:32:39.040 --> 03:32:42.059
that I know I've found the address of the company

4034
03:32:42.309 --> 03:32:43.780
which does the recording

4035
03:32:44.190 --> 03:32:45.299
and I'll ask them

4036
03:32:45.629 --> 03:32:49.099
to give us a copy to sell us a copy of the,

4037
03:32:49.469 --> 03:32:49.709
yes,

4038
03:32:49.870 --> 03:32:50.509
they will sell us.

4039
03:32:50.549 --> 03:32:51.860
It's not very expensive that the one,

4040
03:32:52.950 --> 03:32:54.610
the one that we were in.

4041
03:32:55.429 --> 03:32:56.690
It wasn't as good.

4042
03:32:56.769 --> 03:32:58.450
I thought it was very good though.

4043
03:32:58.530 --> 03:32:59.120
I mean,

4044
03:33:02.080 --> 03:33:02.089
the,

4045
03:33:02.099 --> 03:33:02.150
I've got it,

4046
03:33:02.160 --> 03:33:02.169
yeah.

4047
03:33:04.269 --> 03:33:05.070
There's another one.

4048
03:33:05.150 --> 03:33:05.980
You've got not,

4049
03:33:06.030 --> 03:33:06.230
he's,

4050
03:33:06.320 --> 03:33:06.990
he's a bond,

4051
03:33:07.150 --> 03:33:08.169
he's a bond realised.

4052
03:33:08.709 --> 03:33:09.250
He's done some,

4053
03:33:09.309 --> 03:33:09.870
he's a Muslim,

4054
03:33:09.950 --> 03:33:10.339
but,

4055
03:33:10.629 --> 03:33:11.019
uh,

4056
03:33:11.700 --> 03:33:12.549
his recording is not good.

4057
03:33:12.780 --> 03:33:13.459
Another one is good.

4058
03:33:13.549 --> 03:33:14.200
Just play

4059
03:33:14.759 --> 03:33:15.290
a little bit.

4060
03:33:15.519 --> 03:33:16.900
Something is good in there.

4061
03:33:19.049 --> 03:33:19.209
Yes,

4062
03:33:19.389 --> 03:33:21.139
please be seated 5 minutes more.

4063
03:33:22.950 --> 03:33:24.469
Then he's going to get the proper report.

4064
03:33:26.440 --> 03:33:29.070
Music is very important in these modern times,

4065
03:33:29.080 --> 03:33:30.969
and one has to concentrate on that,

4066
03:33:31.280 --> 03:33:33.230
but the poetry has to be penetrating.

4067
03:33:33.320 --> 03:33:34.040
That's the point.

4068
03:33:39.259 --> 03:33:40.809
And by saying all these things,

4069
03:33:40.889 --> 03:33:41.639
you see,

4070
03:33:41.969 --> 03:33:44.179
it will create also curiosity for Sergioga.

4071
03:33:45.169 --> 03:33:46.519
By using these words.

4072
03:33:52.870 --> 03:33:52.879
I.

4073
03:33:55.809 --> 03:33:56.080
You know.

4074
03:34:00.299 --> 03:34:00.690
I felt

4075
03:34:11.709 --> 03:34:11.750
like.

4076
03:34:13.929 --> 03:34:13.940
colour

4077
03:34:32.379 --> 03:34:32.400
Yeah.

4078
03:34:34.709 --> 03:34:36.240
At the.

4079
03:34:38.110 --> 03:34:38.360
You must

4080
03:34:45.980 --> 03:34:46.320
Oh.

4081
03:34:50.509 --> 03:34:51.150
Yes you

4082
03:34:52.469 --> 03:34:52.849
Come on

4083
03:34:56.339 --> 03:34:57.290
Yes so

4084
03:35:01.570 --> 03:35:01.589
Kay.

4085
03:35:07.750 --> 03:35:07.790
I

4086
03:35:10.179 --> 03:35:10.459
A.

4087
03:35:12.809 --> 03:35:12.990
The

4088
03:35:14.179 --> 03:35:14.580
Oh

4089
03:35:17.200 --> 03:35:17.750
So

4090
03:35:51.429 --> 03:35:51.530
No

4091
03:37:59.379 --> 03:37:59.450
In

4092
03:39:55.179 --> 03:39:55.299
I

4093
03:40:14.389 --> 03:40:15.240
Shot circuit.

4094
03:40:16.570 --> 03:40:18.620
I think all violence is due to that

4095
03:40:19.040 --> 03:40:19.919
all over the world.

4096
03:40:23.150 --> 03:40:23.440
Ah,

4097
03:40:23.549 --> 03:40:24.259
now,

4098
03:40:24.669 --> 03:40:25.219
what's it?

4099
03:40:31.190 --> 03:40:32.940
Anybody else here who hasn't got it,

4100
03:40:32.980 --> 03:40:33.730
who is a new person,

4101
03:40:33.780 --> 03:40:34.330
you got it,

4102
03:40:34.339 --> 03:40:34.780
madam.

4103
03:40:36.730 --> 03:40:37.490
Just see all of them,

4104
03:40:37.650 --> 03:40:38.339
all of them,

4105
03:40:38.490 --> 03:40:40.559
those who are surge is sitting here and watch them.

4106
03:40:40.849 --> 03:40:41.219
See,

4107
03:40:41.650 --> 03:40:44.019
if all of the new people you know who are the news,

4108
03:40:44.250 --> 03:40:44.839
new people.

4109
03:40:45.790 --> 03:40:46.690
Just have a look.

4110
03:40:47.269 --> 03:40:47.469
Left the,

4111
03:40:47.879 --> 03:40:48.980
don't feel guilty.

4112
03:40:49.790 --> 03:40:50.940
If you start feeling guilty,

4113
03:40:50.980 --> 03:40:52.059
vibrations will disappear,

4114
03:40:52.219 --> 03:40:53.809
not to feel guilty at all.

4115
03:40:55.629 --> 03:40:56.070
So Raji,

4116
03:40:56.110 --> 03:40:56.900
are you feeling guilty?

4117
03:41:05.330 --> 03:41:07.200
While people are working on you,

4118
03:41:07.290 --> 03:41:08.599
please just try not to think.

4119
03:41:08.650 --> 03:41:11.799
You will know whatever you have to know and everything you are going to know,

4120
03:41:12.089 --> 03:41:13.759
but just don't think now.

4121
03:41:14.009 --> 03:41:15.009
It has to happen.

4122
03:41:15.250 --> 03:41:16.000
We know it is real.

4123
03:41:16.049 --> 03:41:16.959
It is real.

4124
03:41:17.129 --> 03:41:20.599
Whether you doubt it or not does not change to the fact that it is true.

4125
03:41:20.849 --> 03:41:21.980
But just now you have to get it.

4126
03:41:22.089 --> 03:41:24.440
So please try not to think just now.

4127
03:41:24.570 --> 03:41:25.480
It won't help.

4128
03:41:25.730 --> 03:41:26.690
It's just the noise,

4129
03:41:26.769 --> 03:41:27.370
that's all.

4130
03:41:32.129 --> 03:41:32.860
Anybody

4131
03:41:33.780 --> 03:41:34.900
You just go and see all,

4132
03:41:34.990 --> 03:41:36.990
check all the new people you know who are the new.

4133
03:41:39.190 --> 03:41:40.269
Come forward also here.

4134
03:41:40.309 --> 03:41:40.990
Some are sitting,

4135
03:41:41.070 --> 03:41:42.070
new people are sitting here.

4136
03:41:42.150 --> 03:41:42.740
Just see.

4137
03:41:48.160 --> 03:41:48.860
What do you say?

4138
03:41:52.240 --> 03:41:52.250
