00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.800
I welcome many people here who have not attended a program of Sri Mataji Nirmala Devi.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:14.800
By good fortune, we are holding a seminar here this weekend

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:20.480
and we had the idea to open it out to a wider public

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:29.280
to share with you the remarkable discovery which is Sahaja Yoga.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:49.120
Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi is an absolutely unique figure in this world

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:59.920
and people have come from many European countries to join us this weekend.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.920
I'm going to ask Gregoire de Kalbermatten,

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.597
who is a Swiss national,

00:01:19.377 --> 00:01:26.030
who has written a book on the subject of Sri Mataji's advent,

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:37.680
to make a presentation before Shri Mataji arrives to give you some orientation about

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:52.030
and why it is that this is such a unique opportunity for all of us

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:59.200
at this juncture in our history, in the national history,

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:05.200
in the international history, in the very evolution of our species.

00:02:06.724 --> 00:02:14.240
You may hear some big words this evening,

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:28.303
but I hope that you are people of a calibre to seek the reality, the truth, in big words

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:36.160
and not to be satisfied with superficial answers to sublime questions.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:47.391
We have been having an intensely joyful seminar.

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.545
We want to share that joy with you.

00:02:53.975 --> 00:03:00.160
There is a very specific way by which that joy can be shared by everyone.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:09.920
It's the birthright of everyone. It's nothing especially abnormal.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:16.660
Everyone has the potential within them to achieve what has been promised.

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:36.435
And we hope very much that later on you will make a point of finding out for yourself,

00:03:36.605 --> 00:03:48.160
individually, how much potential you have to transform into the promised state,

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:55.360
which is very blissful, very peaceful and very nourishing,

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.798
which we call Self-realisation.

00:04:04.038 --> 00:04:07.980
After the programme, those who are interested to do so

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:14.728
may like to leave their name and address with us in the foyer

00:04:14.898 --> 00:04:19.184
so that we can be in touch with you about other programmes.

00:04:19.444 --> 00:04:25.324
Programmes are held regularly in London and in many other cities in this country.

00:04:25.664 --> 00:04:29.324
And we look forward to meeting you and getting to know you.

00:04:29.864 --> 00:04:37.206
So without further ado, I'll ask Gregoire to speak to you

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:42.486
and to introduce Shri Mataji who will be here in a few minutes. Thank you.

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.320
All right, it's working.

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:15.280
Again, good evening to everybody and most welcome.

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:21.280
It's a very nice surroundings, we had a very jolly weekend here.

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:25.280
And we thank you for coming this evening.

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:35.280
Now, introducing Sahaja Yoga or Shri Mataji is always a privilege,

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:40.240
although it's not a very easy topic.

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:45.840
The reason it is not an easy topic is that the subject matter

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:53.600
is slightly beyond the borders of our wildest dreams.

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:58.080
And while presenting it, we have to be very careful not to look

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:03.200
like somebody who would be naive to the point of idiocity.

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.280
Is it an English word, idiocity?

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.280
Okay.

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.800
Because what we are talking about is self-realisation.

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.080
If any of us know what self-realisation is about,

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.080
then we know it's a very big thing.

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:24.080
It is something that very few saints and sages of the olden days

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:28.880
used to achieve after lives of tremendous labours and penances

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:30.880
dedicated to that very purpose,

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:35.760
which obviously is not the situation in which I am finding myself.

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:39.920
I am an international civil servant, I have a wife, three children and so on.

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:41.760
So that keeps me pretty busy.

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:51.520
So, self-realisation while living in the world, this sounds like utopia.

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:55.520
I have met Shri Mataji about 10 years ago,

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.920
slightly more I suppose now,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.042
and that is enough for me to know it's not utopia, it's reality.

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:09.932
Now, I have no pretension to communicate this very truth to you,

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:15.040
because if I have accepted it, it is on the basis of my own experience

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:17.360
and not because anybody would tell me so.

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:19.200
Actually the people who told me so,

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:24.140
I told them that they were, you know, kidding themselves.

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:29.100
And I would expect from you the same kind of healthy scepticism.

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:32.000
I.e. you shouldn't believe me of course.

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:38.960
Somebody who believes people in this world today is somebody who is in for troubles,

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:42.240
because especially in the field of spirituality,

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:45.920
you have all kinds of crazy shows going on in town.

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:49.600
Unfortunately these shows are sometimes very successful.

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:52.880
So that for someone who is genuine but confused,

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:55.760
which seems to be the characteristic of many seekers,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:02.899
certainly, I mean I would certainly describe myself as being confused

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:08.782
when I think about the state I was before I met Shri Mataji.

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:13.872
It's very difficult to know who is genuine and who is not,

00:08:14.022 --> 00:08:14.880
who delivers the goods and who doesn't,

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:20.622
and who is just a kind of illusion makers.

00:08:20.722 --> 00:08:30.541
So the way to go about this riddle is just to submit to you that

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:34.960
whatever may be said on Sahaja Yoga is for you an hypothesis.

00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:38.720
And this is probably what Shri Mataji will tell you also in a few minutes.

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:48.939
Now you know that for an hypothesis to be considered as a law,

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:51.440
it has to fulfill two requirements,

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:56.000
it has to be communicable and verifiable under certain conditions.

00:08:56.560 --> 00:09:02.560
So the hypothesis of Sahaja Yoga which is going to be laid down or presented for you,

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:05.920
is going to be verified for those who saw desire,

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:07.360
not for the others of course,

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:12.240
by a session of meditation at the end of the program of Shri Mataji,

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:17.920
in which Shri Mataji will again show her absolutely amazing capacity

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:24.720
to play this catalytical role in granting people their self-realization.

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:28.915
So if you came here to listen to a lecture,

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:37.440
you are like someone who came and thought he had five dollars in his pocket,

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:39.840
but it's not five, it's five thousand dollars.

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:46.400
Because really what you can get this evening is much more than analytical knowledge,

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:48.880
which is communicated by means of words.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.512
So this is a kind of introduction to the hypothesis.

00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:10.800
And I assure you that the only thing it takes to verify what is actually going on,

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:19.625
is a certain intellectual honesty, that's all, a certain genuineness.

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:23.760
And of course a desire to know what's going on,

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:27.840
not about Sahaja Yoga of course, but what's going on about our own life,

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:30.827
about the way to fulfill it.

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:38.320
Now the hypothesis is very simple, this is the framework of the hypothesis,

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:44.281
and what we say is this,

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:51.040
you have the sacrum bone, which is more or less at the bottom of your spine,

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:55.360
an energy which could be called in our tradition as

00:10:55.920 --> 00:11:02.480
the residual consciousness of the Holy Spirit in man.

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:07.440
This energy is called Kundalini in Sanskrit.

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:12.720
Now what we call Self-realization,

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:19.920
that has to be defined, is the following process.

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:25.526
It's the process of this energy going up within the spine,

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:31.440
crossing this famous point known as the third eye in various esoteric traditions,

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:36.160
going through this beautiful flower here,

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:44.720
which Lord Buddha described as the thousand petaled lotus,

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:50.000
and oozing out of the top of the skull.

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:56.960
Now when this takes place, what does it mean, what are the implications?

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:05.370
I think Shri Mataji is already coming.

00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:16.230
What are the implications of this process?

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:26.080
First of all you can register the process in, I would say, essentially two ways.

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:34.960
When the energy crosses this center, the Agnya chakra,

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:40.320
one enters into a state which is a state of silence.

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:45.920
Now we all know we'd rather think a lot and it's not easy to stop thinking,

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:49.360
even if we do so, I mean if we wish to do so.

00:12:51.680 --> 00:13:01.200
This state of silence announces the quality of what Lord Jesus Christ has described as the

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:06.160
kingdom of God, because when one can penetrate farther into this silence,

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:17.040
one undoubtedly discovers a new quality of being, and I would like to come back on this.

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:24.612
Now once the Kundalini is just a couple of centimeters upwards and oozes out of the head,

00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:28.020
then what happens?

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:34.823
There again what happens has been referred to in very ancient texts,

00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:46.880
what actually happens is one feels the manifestation of something which is a cool breeze,

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:58.944
and this is a cool breeze which was called as Pneuma Onus by the Greek Fathers of the Church.

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:10.000
It was referred to also in the Bible as this mighty wind which erupted in the house

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:15.120
where the apostles were gathered for Pentecost.

00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:22.800
There are many references in various cultures to this phenomenon that we call vibrations.

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:29.680
What actually happens is that our central nervous system, which means this physical system by which

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:35.680
we feel sensations, becomes aware of a subtle energy which was always existing before,

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:42.160
but which we could not perceive. It's like you have let's say a radio here,

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:48.240
I mean if the radio is not switched on it cannot pick up all the waves and the music which is in

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:55.600
the room in the same way. Self-realization allows our central nervous system to pick on those waves,

00:14:55.600 --> 00:15:04.480
to feel these vibrations which are a spiritual energy. In other words, this is the meeting point

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:13.440
of matter and spirit because with the material structure one becomes aware of spirit, and this

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:23.440
is a breakthrough into the fourth dimension. These vibrations are the category of perception that Kant

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:32.240
was requiring in order to know the things in themselves, in order to know reality,

00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:39.080
and it is because at that time he said that we don't have this new or this other category

00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:44.530
of perception to know metaphysical realities, metaphysics, that is what is beyond physics.

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:50.860
That is why we should just limit ourselves to rationality and from there on the whole

00:15:51.310 --> 00:15:58.910
demach, the whole direction of the western seekers went into basically this finite world

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:04.240
and no more this world which was keeping people like Plato and Socrates busy,

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:11.200
the world of the things in themselves, of reality. Now this is important to know because this

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:16.960
breakthrough in our category of perception has been solved by so many seekers that people who

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:23.680
know that background, would it be only intellectually, know that one thing has to happen

00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:31.440
in order to know reality, is that we have to have a new means and this is how you'll better

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:36.640
understand the importance of these vibrations and the importance of what can be done with them.

00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:44.400
This is such a rich and vast topic that I simply would not like to enter into it now.

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:52.320
Now going back to what I said a few minutes ago, this quality of silence one discovers at the level

00:16:52.320 --> 00:17:01.520
of the Agnya chakra is the space of reality between two thought movements. Now the action

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:08.240
of this energy which we have called Kundalini pushes the thoughts on the side and then you

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:17.600
enter in your own realm. What actually happened is this, is that once that the Kundalini is at the

00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:28.560
top of the head there is a secret link between the head and the heart and the heart is the seat

00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:38.240
of the self, the spirit, the Atma in Sanskrit. So through this link in your consciousness,

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:45.920
in your brain you start imbibing Atma consciousness, that means you start being

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:55.360
aware conscious of those qualities which are the qualities of the self which are called Sat-Chit-Ananda

00:17:56.160 --> 00:18:00.480
meaning truth consciousness and bliss.

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:07.520
So this is the hypothesis

00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:13.330
as shortly as I could [say].

00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:24.810
This is true Shri Mataji.

00:19:05.675 --> 00:19:09.870
As I mentioned

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:17.520
the very reassuring thing about Sahaja Yoga is that nobody is ever taught to believe in anything that

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:22.080
is not object of experience and perception.

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:35.040
I also mentioned that for those who saw desire the verification of the hypothesis can take place

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:45.443
at the end of this program. Now I should perhaps before ending tell you why it is so.

00:19:45.823 --> 00:19:51.520
Why it is that we who are very, I should say normal people, why is it that we should be in

00:19:51.520 --> 00:20:01.392
a position to know this experience? What have we done to deserve it? I mean if I ask this question

00:20:01.592 --> 00:20:08.662
for myself I'm a bit puzzled because I certainly did not at any point have the

00:20:08.752 --> 00:20:15.428
got the feeling that I had done anything to deserve that.

00:20:15.578 --> 00:20:19.360
So it came as such a surprise to me that I should get my realization that really for

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:28.430
quite some time I would not quite believe that it is so. And I found out later on that many people

00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:33.985
have the same difficulty to relate to something which is so incredibly beyond our wildest dream

00:20:34.075 --> 00:20:38.825
that it's just too good to be true. You know where is the catch? I mean it's not possible.

00:20:38.915 --> 00:20:43.760
Well it is. And Shri Mataji is as a very which I welcome here, very gracious of you to have come and

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:53.165
we thank you so much. We certainly are very grateful to you for coming Shri Mataji.

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:58.880
Shri Mataji is a very poetical simple image which in my view is perfect for the world.

00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:04.640
Which in my view is perfect because it carries the strength of simplicity and it says it all.

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:10.240
Shri Mataji says that well if you have a tree which starts producing flowers in the middle of

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:19.760
winter under snow and storm this is a miracle. And that miracle where those great souls of the past

00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:26.400
which received their realization at a point where the whole evolutionary process was not quite

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:31.360
mature for this. Therefore they had to struggle in an incredible way. And this is what you learn

00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:41.840
when you study the lives of such great people. Now if this same tree is blossoming in spring it's

00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:52.480
not a miracle. It's nature's ways and rhythm. It is the dance of evolution. It is the moment that

00:21:52.480 --> 00:22:01.040
should happen. And so Shri Mataji says we now have entered the time where this process of triggering

00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:10.400
en masse self-realization has come. And if you study arts, literature, anything, any parameter

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:14.800
of modern civilization you know that there is a tremendous expectation for this kind of

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:22.480
breakthrough. And this is pretty obvious that today Englishmen for instance are not motivated

00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:28.640
by many things certainly not by competing with Japanese in order to make gadgets. I mean the

00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:38.560
economic indicators prove that they don't devote much energy to these things. So what do they care about?

00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:50.160
Cricket maybe but other things too. And actually I would submit that it is probably an evolutionary

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:55.440
progress to accept that GNP should decrease because one does not bother about it. But then

00:22:55.440 --> 00:23:02.000
what should we devote our attention to? And many people in this country as in any so-called

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.960
industrial countries are trying to devote more energy to the pursuit of this inner truth.

00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:14.880
The only trouble is the setup that I've described before is that there is such a big show in town

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:21.440
that people don't go into the right shop because first of all they assume it has to be found in a

00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:34.320
shop where you can buy it and this is the first mistake. So here you can't buy because it's too

00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:42.640
expensive. It's so expensive that it can only be given. Shri Mataji says that realization is

00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:48.880
as important as breathing. If you would have to puncture your bank account in order to have

00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:53.520
the right to breathe you would be dead long time back. And this it is the same thing.

00:23:56.800 --> 00:24:03.440
So it happens now because now the time has come and it happens for another reason. And this

00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:06.800
other reason if I may say so is sitting before you.

00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:22.080
Now speaking to I would say a few people who have never had exposure to Sahaja Yoga,

00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:26.880
I should certainly keep a kind of sobriety while introducing Shri Mataji which is difficult

00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:36.320
because her achievements are so extraordinary that they are difficult to express in English

00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:41.295
which is a language appreciating understatements.

00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:48.960
It's very difficult to understate Shri Mataji. I mean we are condemned to understate her anyway

00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:59.200
but how to give some or render some justice to her labor, the work she has been doing in this

00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:04.320
country and I should say in the whole of Western Europe not to mention Australia and of course

00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:14.320
India. What I know is that she's a totally selfless, totally genuine person. Not only

00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:21.120
she didn't ever take any penny, I should blush for saying such a nonsense from anybody,

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:29.520
but the first lot of her followers in London were of such a kind of economically derelict

00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:35.600
soul that she had to pay for the rent of the flat for some time. So this is one of the oddities of

00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:41.440
Sahaja Yoga and there are many others that you will discover in your time. Shri Mataji

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:49.840
despite a tremendous power that we would not be able to face if that power would not be just

00:25:51.280 --> 00:26:01.360
love, despite siddhis, despite qualities that in my humble view are to be found in nobody on this

00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:06.480
earth and I have seen a lot of so-called spiritual people before I met Shri Mataji. Despite all this

00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:19.438
she's extremely human, I mean much more than me, I'm quite surprised about that.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:32.720
There is a word in Sanskrit for this and this word is called Mahamaya and Mahamaya means the

00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:37.920
great illusion. So you have the privilege to sit this evening in front of

00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:46.590
a very very great illusion and this is the illusion that you're in front of a human being.

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:52.960
It's a nice illusion though because if you would realize that it is not so,

00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:56.000
you may run away and this is not the purpose of the evening.

00:27:07.672 --> 00:27:14.432
So I suppose that I should end this few words by means of introduction.

00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:25.920
Thanking you very much for having come all the way from wherever you came and if Sahaja Yoga

00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:30.000
is full of joy, is full of humor, it's also a sacred reality.

00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:39.120
It is the sacred reality of our innermost divine being

00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:49.040
which opens itself if we in all humility and sincerity so wish. Shri Mataji, I am again

00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:55.200
in the name of everybody most graceful that you should grace this evening and it is my

00:27:55.200 --> 00:28:01.360
humblest prayer that everybody who has come should experience their Self-realization and what is even

00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:09.280
I should say what is even as important as that should understand what great great gift

00:28:14.959 --> 00:28:23.280
that evening is for them. Thank you very much.

00:28:30.268 --> 00:28:32.768
It's beautiful flowers.

00:29:11.257 --> 00:29:14.107
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:29:25.597 --> 00:29:34.687
We had no intentions of having any public programs in England but somehow Mr. Gavin

00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:49.120
Brown, hopes against hopes, and they spent lot of money for this program and I only feel

00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:58.160
sorry that every time they have a public program we get very few people and even if you get

00:29:58.210 --> 00:30:04.730
Last time we had about three hundred people who were new. They got, some of them did touch

00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:15.580
realization. They looked very serious but nothing inside. We lost most of them because

00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:25.600
you see we have become used to our mental capacity to enact something and not to be

00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:33.840
the reality. It's a speciality of mental people that they talk too much, they say too

00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:44.480
much, have nothing with them. It's very shocking sometimes when you see how people

00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:53.520
say things about reality. I watch sometimes television, I see people on the television

00:30:53.760 --> 00:31:00.080
and I feel they are somewhere near reality, they are talking about reality. They understand

00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:08.240
that there's something missing in their lives and they are looking for it but when

00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:17.360
it comes to actualization and to achieving what you have, whatever is your own, they

00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:27.920
become absolutely mundane, frivolous, very surprising. I can't understand why it should

00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:35.920
happen. Now supposing you say, as Gregoire has been giving Me certificates, great certificates

00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:41.920
he has given and also he's a diplomat so diplomatically he was trying to please all

00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:48.240
of you so that you take to Sahaja Yoga because he doesn't want you to commit the same mistakes

00:31:48.240 --> 00:32:01.600
that most of them have committed. But despite all that let us face ourselves clearly. Newcomers

00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:09.600
are absolutely a minority here so I'm talking also to Sahaja Yogis. Let us face ourselves

00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:20.720
fully. Are we ourselves? We've got everything supposing, we say, All right, we have seen

00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:28.400
the power of political achievement, of economic achievements, of other achievements which

00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:36.640
we call emotional achievements. But have we really faced ourselves? Have we seen ourselves?

00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:46.480
What is our quality of life? I asked an Englishman, I said, What is the quality of an Englishman?

00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:54.880
He said, It depends on how many times he goes for a sea resort. Can you imagine? What? Sea

00:32:54.880 --> 00:33:01.040
resort. How many years back did you start going to the sea resort? I don't think we

00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:05.840
never heard about it in India. It's about twenty-five years back, somebody's stupid

00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:12.640
fellow must be, or somebody very clever maybe, put this idea that we all should go to the

00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:24.560
sea resort because we must get our skin full of cancer. So the quality of a person doesn't

00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:37.120
depend on a mental acceptance of something that looks new. And that's what is happening

00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:44.560
to all of us is, anything new that comes, we accept it and we think we have equality.

00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:51.520
If a lady goes supposing to us at a sea resort, because I meet the other kind also who are

00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:58.320
not seekers at all, she'll come and tell and say, Now see what tan I have got. I mean,

00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:06.320
it's so superficial, it's so frivolous, it's so nonsensical. I mean, is this the

00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:15.920
value of your life? You have come out of amoeba stage to this stage and what are you doing

00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:27.760
about yourself, making it tan? That sometimes really makes me feel very disappointed. And

00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:39.760
this is such a common topic all over. What are we? We are human beings. We have come

00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:47.200
out of amoeba to other stage and other stage in thousands of years. Today we are human

00:34:47.200 --> 00:35:00.880
beings, made to achieve something great. Nature has worked on us relentlessly, so beautifully,

00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:12.880
so delicately, so lovingly, for what? And when we just become mental, according to Indian

00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:21.280
philosophers, a mental person is nothing but a stupid fellow. Egoistical person he becomes

00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:29.280
and he becomes nothing but a stupid fellow. Because anything that comes of the mental

00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:37.680
expression. Today I was only watching about the modern art. Modern art is all right if

00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:48.320
you know how to become super modern, that is a realized soul. But this modern art was

00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:56.320
described by a gentleman and then ultimately he got into the real mood of saying something

00:35:56.320 --> 00:36:02.720
that is the truth. He said that this all expression shows that we were barbaric and

00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:18.800
now we have become worse than barbaric. So the whole expression of our life is something

00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:27.520
that we have done out of our mental thing, we are so much in imbalance. Now the main

00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:38.320
thing one has to understand that you are made a human being by the kindness, the grace of

00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:54.640
the nature of God Almighty, as I call it. Not by you, not by mental thought. You have

00:36:54.640 --> 00:37:07.440
a special value, you have a very, very special value in the eyes of the nature, in the working

00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:20.560
of the evolutionary process. Have we got any concept as to what is expected out of

00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:37.360
us? Are we to waste our life into these frivolous, stupid things, doing everything very simply

00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:44.160
seriously though? They're very serious about all stupidity, especially then they

00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:48.720
talk for a greater stupidity they are more serious. They think without that there won't

00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:58.960
be any impression on people. But the main thing is we have missed the point. The point

00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:08.400
is you have to be the Spirit. All these doings are to be the Spirit. It's not talking,

00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:13.120
it's not your mental projections, all your new ideas coming up and going up, it's not

00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:27.200
that. It is you have to be the Spirit. Face it up. This you cannot purchase in the market,

00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:36.240
you cannot. You cannot put in any effort. Now you are that, just to become that. That's

00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:50.560
what your quality is. That's what I see you as. Or anybody who is a realized soul.

00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:59.549
But what do you see yourself as, is the main point. That's why there cannot be much report.

00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:13.280
Anything new that is brought to you, oh it's nice. How, how do you know?

00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:19.440
Traditions we have put on one side, because tradition means all conditioning,

00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:27.520
all wrong things, tradition we don't want, all right. So now what are you clinging to?

00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:34.560
At least tradition had one safe point. That trial and error you have found out something sensible.

00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:43.120
Now you put tradition all nonsense. Why? Because you cannot take out the good out of that tradition.

00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:50.080
So now you are going to the other side saying, all right, no tradition, we love this new style.

00:39:50.720 --> 00:40:00.640
We don't want to be covered by any tradition. Like people might say, what is in a painting of say,

00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:13.360
of say, Marlowe, whom I like very much, say, what is so great? We can do some drip painting.

00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:17.760
They have drip painting, I don't know what sort of paintings they have these days.

00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:21.440
Why should we? You can't do even one painting like that.

00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:34.046
You can't even reproduce. You cannot think of such a painting, face it. Modern mind is incapable

00:40:34.156 --> 00:40:50.094
of conceiving that. Accept it. You have gone down in quality. Why? Because of mental movement.

00:40:50.244 --> 00:40:59.259
It's such a limited movement, but those people believed in something higher, higher, higher

00:40:59.399 --> 00:41:10.059
ideals. They thought of God, they thought of perfecting themselves, not putting the chaos in

00:41:10.139 --> 00:41:20.895
your heart outside, no, perfecting, resting in that, believing in that, in that peaceful

00:41:21.005 --> 00:41:26.345
atmosphere they created something that you cannot produce. Only thing what you can do?

00:41:26.415 --> 00:41:34.814
I don't like it. Like in my house, I was screen made in Saranpur long time back, it's beautifully

00:41:34.874 --> 00:41:40.854
done, it has got beautiful honeycomb work which no one can do. Found some people came

00:41:40.904 --> 00:41:52.869
to see, I don't like it. I said, can you make even three inches of that? That's the only

00:41:52.969 --> 00:41:59.520
thing you can do is to say, I don't like it, finished. Can you do three inches? Can you?

00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:09.040
You can't. Accept this fact. Once you accept this fact, I'm sure the humility that is needed

00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:18.560
will come into you. Humility is lacking. Seekers must have humility, otherwise they will go

00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:23.040
to people who will pamper their egos and they will be drifted into nonsensical till their

00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:30.400
money is finished, till they become absolutely lunatics or epileptics, they will just continue

00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:42.480
and will finish off. But to be sensible, to be sane, one has to understand that our worth

00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:48.320
is much more than this. Like a BBC fellow comes and tells Me, I mean he thinks, he's

00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:53.200
praising you, I don't know what, whatever you may call it, that an Anglo-Saxon brain

00:42:53.200 --> 00:43:01.440
cannot understand anything spiritual for which you don't have to pay. I really tell you

00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:07.680
that he said it to Me. And I refused to go on that BBC because I said, first of all,

00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:13.440
your Anglo-Saxon brain must be all right. Is it a special brain you have made, Anglo-Saxon

00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:23.680
brains, are they specially made by God? When you say you are Anglo-Saxon brain you have

00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:32.960
absolutely put down your value, down. And when you say it's a human brain, then you

00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:43.520
are great because you become one of that great world. There's no global sense, we

00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:50.000
don't have a global sense at all within ourselves. Whatever we have is so localized

00:43:50.000 --> 00:44:01.120
and insular understanding, so insular that we just say, I don't like it, I don't

00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:14.400
want it. Who is this I, is only possible when we come to some humility.

00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:20.560
With all respect to England, because England to Me is very great and it's the heart of

00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:25.760
the universe. And when I say this in the European countries they get rather upset, Mother, what?

00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:32.160
England is the heart, that's too much, Mother, we can't digest this. It is the

00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:46.640
heart, whatever you like it or not. It is the heart, no doubt. But what a heart, can't

00:44:46.640 --> 00:45:02.240
break it, you know, cannot make it expand. This is the sad part of English, is, it's

00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:13.440
the heart, is a very important organ of the universe. But the cells that exist here, who

00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:21.440
are supposed to circulate in the whole world, who have to achieve so many things as the

00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:38.640
cells of the heart achieve by pumping out new refreshed blood, is expected to have beautiful

00:45:38.640 --> 00:45:49.440
heart, an English mark, a heart that is to be cherished, to be enjoyed and appreciated.

00:45:49.440 --> 00:46:02.000
Where are they? With all this expenditure on these people here, previously I used to

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:08.480
do it in England, but I gave up, exhausted all my bank and how many disciples I get are

00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:16.160
seven for four years. I said, give up these people, good for nothing, useless. All the

00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:23.840
money they spend, and what do you find, what's the quality, how many come up and how many

00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:38.400
work it out, how many care for their Self-realization? For Me to say that I work very hard, I don't

00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:51.440
think I work at all, I don't work. I do not work, it emits, it's there. But it's

00:46:51.440 --> 00:47:09.440
a waste, it's a waste land. How are we going to sow the seed in the waste land? How

00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:18.720
are we going to work it out? Especially London seems to be a rock, rock of Gibraltar has

00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:24.400
come in London, I think. For this place, Wimbledon, you'll be surprised, we are very

00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:31.760
fond of tennis, so both of us used to come. And our driver would say, we must go one hour

00:47:31.760 --> 00:47:40.800
earlier. Why? You just can't get in there. And we used to come one hour earlier to get

00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:50.240
into the lanes of this Wimbledon to go and see the tennis. And the same Wimbledon has

00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:56.880
twenty people, new people over here. I really wanted to go back, because I felt what sort

00:47:56.880 --> 00:48:03.680
of a quality is this that I'm wasting my time with. We tried everything, diplomatic

00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:11.280
relationship, food we invited them, gave them food, tea, Indian tea, all kinds of things

00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:23.760
we tried, that a mother should try her level best. You don't understand this. Of course

00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:29.680
the Indians who are here are all uprooted people, I don't call them Indians at all,

00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:35.360
most of them. They are just uprooted people. They don't understand the value of their

00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:44.240
life, no, most of them. Of course there are some sensible people also, no doubt, a very

00:48:44.240 --> 00:48:50.800
few. So now what are we to do, supposing there is something great that has to happen to this

00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:56.480
world, and that you are the ones who have to be blessed. You can you believe it? I've

00:48:56.480 --> 00:49:07.680
been here for twelve years now, this will be the twelfth year. But there's a guru who

00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:15.120
wants a Rolls Royce, he's already got fifty-eight, he wants a fifty-ninth. There are sixty thousand

00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:25.600
people here who are buying a Rolls Royce for that person. What happens to your brains,

00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:36.320
I can't understand. Is that the Spirit? Is that what you are seeking? Understatement

00:49:36.320 --> 00:49:46.720
I understand, but undervaluing I don't understand. No value for your own being, not for your

00:49:46.720 --> 00:50:02.560
own evolution and for your own personality. I tell you, I've done everything under the

00:50:02.560 --> 00:50:08.880
sun in this country. In India I've hardly worked for two years, and we have thousands

00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:13.920
and thousands of people who are Sahaja Yogis today. Our country is going to change very

00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:29.520
fast, I know that. It will work out even in so many other countries. But England, William

00:50:29.520 --> 00:50:35.520
Blake, I don't know, he dreamt so great about England because he knew the quality

00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:48.640
of England, that Jerusalem. Do you think, you still hope what he said? You have such

00:50:48.640 --> 00:50:57.520
an advantage of your language, you have such an advantage that you can read about so many

00:50:57.520 --> 00:51:04.960
things. Most of the books of philosophy are translated into your language. You are specially

00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:20.320
being blessed by so much of knowledge, despite that. Why, why people are so much unaware

00:51:20.320 --> 00:51:36.880
of their worth, of their deserving capacity. What do they deserve? Let's see. Is the

00:51:36.880 --> 00:51:41.920
expectation of the disasters that are going to come, or horrible things that are going

00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:47.040
to happen in this world, all these things, do we deserve or do we deserve some sort of

00:51:47.040 --> 00:51:54.640
a great hope for ourselves? And everything is within you, you can see that, it's all

00:51:54.640 --> 00:52:04.000
there, it's your own. Why shouldn't you have it? I mean, we have tried everything

00:52:04.010 --> 00:52:09.259
to push you down to that point, every way, every method. As in Sanskrit they say,

00:52:09.309 --> 00:52:16.640
‘Kāma, Dama, Daṇḍa, Bheda, Nīti’, everything, five things we have tried, to work it out. So now only

00:52:16.640 --> 00:52:23.200
another thing is to push people with piston up there and keep them waiting. That also

00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:39.840
perhaps you've done, isn't it? The whole world is looking at you, remember that.

00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:49.120
Not big talking, not big saying, but the big thing happening within you, is actualization

00:52:49.120 --> 00:52:59.200
of that great thing, which is so simple, so beautiful. It takes hardly anything for you

00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:07.200
to become your Spirit, but to maintain it, to respect it and to be there. I don't know

00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:14.320
what sort of a special glue we should have, they just don't stick on. They meet Me on

00:53:14.320 --> 00:53:20.320
the shop, Mother, I said, how? Oh, you don't know, I came to it twelve years back, you

00:53:20.320 --> 00:53:25.440
gave Me realization, all right, now what are you doing about it? Mother, I lost it, you

00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:39.120
know, really. It's very common, very common phenomenon. So those who are here today, twenty

00:53:39.120 --> 00:53:53.040
people, I hope are special, and they consider this experience as something special, and

00:53:53.200 --> 00:54:02.880
establish themselves as great saints, knowing everything about their own powers.

00:54:06.160 --> 00:54:10.080
It all has to be free, you cannot pay for it.

00:54:15.280 --> 00:54:22.800
I'm really frustrated, I must say. I was going away this time to India, I would have been there,

00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:34.720
but as you say, one is more concerned about the lost lambs. India is very easy, so I've

00:54:34.720 --> 00:54:41.120
stuck back. I hope you are not going to disappoint Me, those who have come for the first time,

00:54:41.120 --> 00:54:50.560
please, Gregoire has tried his tricks, everybody tries, but I don't know how to make people

00:54:50.560 --> 00:54:58.160
stick. A surprising, in the West people have developed the best quality glues, we cannot

00:54:58.160 --> 00:55:04.480
develop such in India, or any developing countries, don't have glues, but as far as they are

00:55:04.480 --> 00:55:12.320
concerned they cannot stick on to anything whatsoever. They cannot stick on to their

00:55:12.320 --> 00:55:15.760
wives, they cannot stick on to their husbands, they cannot stick on to their houses, they

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:22.640
cannot stick on to anything whatsoever. And whatever has to grow has to stick on somewhere.

00:55:26.080 --> 00:55:32.880
If you have to make a well, then you find some water, then you dig it down, then you dig one,

00:55:32.880 --> 00:55:36.880
then another, then another, then go about. That's not the way.

00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:47.920
There has to be that breaking into the depth that you are, there has to be that happening,

00:55:47.920 --> 00:55:57.920
where you break into your own depth, your own quality, your own wealth, but that time

00:55:57.920 --> 00:56:03.920
you don't give, you don't give to yourself, you have no time for yourself, you have time

00:56:04.160 --> 00:56:11.200
for all kinds of nonsensical things, but no time for yourself to see what beauty lies,

00:56:11.200 --> 00:56:27.280
what glory lies behind this body, above this mind, and below these emotions.

00:56:34.080 --> 00:56:43.680
I do not know any other method is possible now. I must say I give up, I've tried everything.

00:56:46.560 --> 00:56:52.640
And as you have heard about Sahaja Yoga, it's a fact, there's no doubt about it,

00:56:53.520 --> 00:56:59.280
there's nothing to lose, you are the Spirit, you have to become the Spirit.

00:56:59.600 --> 00:57:07.600
It must relate to the traditional expression of your evolution. It cannot cut out all the saints,

00:57:08.480 --> 00:57:18.173
all the great prophets, all the great religious leaders, it cannot cut out, but it integrates

00:57:18.240 --> 00:57:26.000
all the essences of these great advents who came on this earth to guide us. It does not cut out

00:57:26.880 --> 00:57:38.000
anywhere, and that's what is Sahaja Yoga. Sahaja, as you know, was spontaneous. Now,

00:57:39.040 --> 00:57:46.080
spontaneous can be quite misrepresented if you use through your brains. Spontaneous means

00:57:46.080 --> 00:57:52.320
it's a living process that should happen to all of you, and don't miss the point.

00:57:52.320 --> 00:58:06.032
You have to spend at least a month to see the light that you have got

00:58:06.560 --> 00:58:12.560
is to be carried much deeper into you. You are deep, you are great,

00:58:13.520 --> 00:58:19.920
but if you have to find the pearls that are hidden, you have to go deep down.

00:58:20.880 --> 00:58:28.160
It's very simple because the more you go deeper into yourself, the more you enjoy,

00:58:28.160 --> 00:58:38.640
the more you become a wholesome personality, a greater personality, a personality that sees

00:58:40.160 --> 00:58:46.480
everything on a universal level and understand everything that is global.

00:58:49.920 --> 00:59:01.520
I'm sorry today I am not in My real, proper mood, I should say,

00:59:03.760 --> 00:59:09.360
because I know how much these people have done. They have advertised, they have gone round,

00:59:11.040 --> 00:59:16.320
they have put up advertisements everywhere, put up so much money, you know, that what

00:59:16.320 --> 00:59:24.400
Standard Times or what, what was this, oh God, and that Times, also Times take so much

00:59:24.400 --> 00:59:31.200
money out of your pockets. Just think of it. They are like gurus, you see.

00:59:34.400 --> 00:59:40.960
All that to spend and what do you get out of it, one feels so sad, it's very sad.

00:59:41.200 --> 00:59:54.513
Of course America is so much worse that relatively you don't feel that sad when you think of America.

01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:08.800
But after describing all the American art today, the gentleman came to the conclusion

01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:16.880
and he said that after seeing all this art one reaches a conclusion to say that they

01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:25.440
were barbarians and now they have become worst barbarians. Oh God, I said, what am I to do

01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:32.080
with these Americans now? But to Me you are all My children, you are all Mine. I cannot

01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:38.960
allow you to be drifted away. Till the last I'll try to work out. I know I feel sometimes

01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:48.400
very desperate and sad. English have very much changed now. They are so much influenced

01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:54.800
by the French. Now the French are better but they are influenced by the old French and

01:00:54.880 --> 01:01:04.880
the old Americans, not the new ones. New ones are very alert. So all the old ideas of these

01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:13.760
nonsensical writers are lingering now in England, deposited like in a case of angina in the

01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:23.840
heart, you see, when there is hardening of the arteries, all the bad blood stagnates

01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:29.840
like that, it's happening, I feel. They have given up these ideas, they have rid of it,

01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:35.840
they don't want to have it. We are still continuing with them.

01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:47.840
Something respectable for ourselves, that's what I feel. Today being most of them, Sahaja

01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:53.840
Yogi is here, I'm sure you'll all get your realization in no time, I'm sure of that.

01:01:53.840 --> 01:02:00.840
But that's not sufficient. Out of the three hundred we got in Hampstead, with all the

01:02:00.840 --> 01:02:07.840
work these people did, advertising, this, that, whatever was possible, five people,

01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:18.840
some or other, stuck on, and only three I think with a great glue came down. That should

01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:24.840
not happen again. So specially for the new people I have to tell you that this is something

01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:33.840
so important that has come to be emboldened. All these tennis players, I've seen them

01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:39.840
coming and going. One comes this year, next year he goes away, somebody is today a top

01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:48.840
seat, then he goes down, not in Sahaja Yoga. You ascend and ascend and ascend and ascend,

01:02:48.840 --> 01:03:04.840
eternally. It's a very different style of tennis. It's a real plague. It's no professionals

01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:16.840
are needed, you become such tremendous players, such a game you develop. And that's what

01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:25.840
is there for you just to jump into it and to understand the swimming. And I'm sure

01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:34.840
it will work out. I hope all those who have come for the first time will not treat themselves

01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:44.840
frivolously, but will stand up to it and give us some encouragement to work out more in

01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:51.840
England. Otherwise maybe tomorrow all the Sahaja Yogis from here may come to India with

01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:59.840
their, what do you say, stock, what, stock, lock, lock, stock and barrel, lock, stock

01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:04.840
and barrel, of course without the barrels.

01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:12.840
Let's see now how it works out. There's nothing serious about it. You have to be

01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:19.840
very pleasantly placed towards yourself. This is one thing you should know. A person who

01:04:19.840 --> 01:04:35.840
is godly is never serious inside. He's playing the game. So in that playful mood of a Maldan,

01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:42.840
let us see what happens. May God bless you.

01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:49.840
Any questions? I'll have some water.

01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:51.840
Thank you.

01:05:14.746 --> 01:05:27.840
No questions? That seems to be good. You are free to ask questions. If you have to achieve

01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:37.840
complete freedom, your freedom is to be respected. Your freedom has to be respected.

01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:41.840
Yes?

01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:55.840
I'm a Christian and I do the meditation. So I'm welcome to put it out.

01:05:55.840 --> 01:06:00.840
He's a Christian, he does meditation and he wonders whether he's welcome to our yoga.

01:06:00.840 --> 01:06:08.840
Very much. But if you are a Christian, please be seated, please be seated.

01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:16.840
Christian is all right, any religion is all right, it's all great, but it has talked of the future.

01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:31.840
Christ has said, I will send you a comforter, counselor and a redeemer. Why don't the Christians

01:06:31.840 --> 01:06:41.840
look for someone like that? Christ is gone now, he's not here. Why don't they look out for

01:06:41.840 --> 01:06:45.723
a Holy Ghost?

01:06:56.840 --> 01:07:03.840
He himself has said it. Mohammed Sahib has said that during the time of resurrection

01:07:03.840 --> 01:07:18.840
your hands will speak. What about the Muslims? Why don't they look out for the resurrection?

01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:31.840
Third is Guru Nanaka, Kabira. Nanaka was so great that he combined all the realized souls

01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:46.788
who were poets and made a big beautiful grands-aub. What are the Sikhs doing? They are just reading it, reading it.

01:07:49.068 --> 01:08:00.840
He says, without knowing yourself you will be in illusion. He said very clearly. Then

01:08:00.840 --> 01:08:07.840
should we not look for that? But what happens, I tell you, what's the mistake is, once a

01:08:07.840 --> 01:08:20.840
religion is organized it neutralizes all your ascent. Organized. I also took My birth in

01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:33.840
the Christian religion, so-called I would say, specially that too Protestant for particular

01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:45.840
reasons. I could have taken birth anywhere else but now. And there is no talk of ascent,

01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:54.840
no talk of second birth. Artificially somebody puts his hand on your head, now you are a

01:08:54.840 --> 01:09:02.840
Christian. I don't know how you become. Same about Hindus, same about every one of them,

01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:13.840
they are leading an artificial religion. It's a garb. Reality is within. Whatever these

01:09:13.840 --> 01:09:23.840
people have worked and said is not done by them. It's become a superficial thing. You

01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:32.840
will not be happy unless and until you find your Spirit. How can you organize religion?

01:09:32.840 --> 01:09:45.840
How can you organize God? Then you think you belong to a church, you belong to a, what

01:09:45.840 --> 01:09:54.840
you call that, a sect or what is it called, another thing, something. Denomination. All

01:09:54.840 --> 01:10:03.840
these denominations brand us. What's the thing for me? All of them are just the same,

01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:18.840
still groping in the dark. How many are seeking reality? It's not that Christianity has failed,

01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:34.840
it is the church that has failed. Christ can never fail, nor can Guru Nanaka, nor can

01:10:34.840 --> 01:10:43.840
Mohammed Sahab. What fails is our understanding of them. Let us be the Spirit and then we'll

01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:51.840
understand them. They are all one, hand in hand, no difference at all. They are all one,

01:10:51.840 --> 01:11:07.840
believe Me. You don't have to give up anything, you have to just see to the essence of it.

01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:14.840
Supposing a leaf is sick, you cannot treat it at the leaf end, you have to go to the

01:11:14.840 --> 01:11:20.840
roots and when you go to the roots you find you have not given up any leaf. You are at

01:11:20.840 --> 01:11:26.840
the roots and you are at the leaf also everywhere you exist. There are so many seekers lost

01:11:26.840 --> 01:11:38.840
in this kind of a denomination, so many of them. Thank God my parents were realized souls,

01:11:38.840 --> 01:11:47.840
thank God, because I found Protestants with different type of fanatics, you see, very

01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:53.840
sophisticated. They would never find out that they are fanatics, so sophisticated, you know.

01:11:53.840 --> 01:12:00.840
If you make anything very sophisticated you can't find it out. We can call everybody

01:12:00.840 --> 01:12:06.840
else a fanatic but a Protestant you can never call because they are a mental people. They

01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:15.840
have made it very sophisticated. So if you become so very sophisticated that you cannot

01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:26.840
see yourself and you cannot make it out that it's I who is following some sort of a fanaticism,

01:12:26.840 --> 01:12:35.840
an ideology, a mental projection, how can you get out of it? From every religion people

01:12:35.840 --> 01:12:44.840
will think, oh Baba, this is fanaticism, this is too much. But for this I may be the most

01:12:44.840 --> 01:12:57.840
I may be the first and I hope I'm not the last. Martin Luther himself was a realized

01:12:57.840 --> 01:13:10.840
soul no doubt, but at that time, in that short time, with all kinds of oppressions and pressures,

01:13:10.840 --> 01:13:22.840
how far could he go? And then there's already an attack built in with Paul and then with

01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:34.840
Augustine. What can he do? Any realized soul like Khalil Gibran could see it clearly.

01:13:40.872 --> 01:13:50.840
So we have to know one thing, we have to love the truth. Truth is to be discovered through

01:13:50.840 --> 01:14:10.840
your Spirit and love your truth and not untruth. Any denomination is untruth. What is the truth?

01:14:11.840 --> 01:14:21.840
Is the essence of that. Everything is becoming a plastic and then we say why people are living

01:14:21.840 --> 01:14:27.840
churches, why people are running up from Christian faith or from that faith. Nothing wrong with

01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:36.840
Christ, I think. No, it's wrong with us that we have made all these plastic things

01:14:36.840 --> 01:14:49.840
to cover His image. The greatest justice you can do to Christ is to get your realization.

01:14:52.840 --> 01:15:03.840
He was crucified for that, He came for that and He waits for that. So please get your

01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:16.840
realization first and then you will know what is Christ and how great He is. May God bless

01:15:16.840 --> 01:15:17.840
you.

01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:23.840
What else is there? Any other question? It's a good question because that problem faces

01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:37.840
everyone of you. Let's see. There could be denominations like communist, capitalist,

01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:51.840
east, feast, all sorts of things. There could be, any time. I don't know the latest. I

01:15:51.840 --> 01:16:04.840
think lost counts after anti-culturists. There's only one denomination of God is

01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:16.840
a realized soul, a yogi, one with God. That's the only one. There's no other denomination

01:16:16.840 --> 01:16:31.840
where all of them combine, Christ, Mohammed, Lao Tse, Socrates, Krishna, Rama, Nanaka,

01:16:31.840 --> 01:16:40.840
Kabira, all of them combine in that great family of divinity.

01:16:41.840 --> 01:16:56.840
All right, so should we have realization? I mean most of you have had. Is there any

01:16:56.840 --> 01:17:00.777
question you can ask? I'll be very happy.

01:17:02.457 --> 01:17:07.557
[unclear]

01:17:17.196 --> 01:17:22.956
What is wrong with the people who call themselves born again Christans. 

01:17:23.077 --> 01:17:28.811
No, this is the problem is you cannot call yourself. This is a very big problem. You

01:17:28.840 --> 01:17:33.840
see when I went to America, I must tell you, when I started talking about it they said,

01:17:33.840 --> 01:17:41.840
you must, what do you say that, make it a registration of my speeches, what is it called?

01:17:41.840 --> 01:17:42.840
Oh, copyright.

01:17:42.840 --> 01:17:49.840
I must have a copyright, you see. Of course I'm very bad at the human laws. So I said,

01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:55.840
all right, now what is that for? He said, they will try to copy you. I said, let them

01:17:55.840 --> 01:18:03.840
copy, it's very good, I mean I'll be very happy. So then you must have a copyright.

01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:10.840
Now I said then, what will they do? They said, you see, they will use your words, your sentence

01:18:10.840 --> 01:18:17.840
as a very good idea. But you know what they did? They started calling themselves born

01:18:17.840 --> 01:18:27.840
again. Born again. You cannot call yourself anything. You see, it's a power, it's a state,

01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:31.840
it's a situation in which you have to be. If you are just born again, you say yourself,

01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:38.840
what is your power? Born again, the first power you get is that you become, your nerves

01:18:38.840 --> 01:18:50.840
become, your brain becomes collectively conscious in your awareness. That's the minimum that

01:18:50.840 --> 01:18:59.840
should happen to you. It's not certificate, it's another, oh I, that is the latest than

01:18:59.840 --> 01:19:11.840
the anti-culture is, then they might be the latest, is another denomination. Is no reality

01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:18.840
then. You don't know one of the, one of the, they attacked Me in Switzerland and the lady

01:19:18.840 --> 01:19:24.840
born again was wearing all kinds of glittery things and she was bringing a Bible to hit

01:19:24.840 --> 01:19:32.840
Me, you know, and I couldn't bear the whole joke and I started laughing and everybody

01:19:32.840 --> 01:19:36.840
was very upset but I was just laughing. I said, what a nice thing, born again coming

01:19:36.840 --> 01:19:45.840
up to hit Me. What wrong am I doing to you? But you see, the thing is the organized religion

01:19:45.840 --> 01:19:53.720
is such a possession, is such a security for people that they say, oh we are born again,

01:19:53.840 --> 01:20:02.720
now certified, certified and they feel very secured with it I think, otherwise I can't

01:20:02.840 --> 01:20:09.840
understand why should you accept such a title, you are born again, unless and until you have

01:20:09.840 --> 01:20:14.840
the power, you must know what is the power one should have as a born again. They have

01:20:14.840 --> 01:20:25.840
no knowledge, nothing, they just know Bible which also is so superficial. There is no

01:20:25.840 --> 01:20:41.840
depth in their life, nothing, self-certification. There's no certificate in Sahaja Yoga. If

01:20:41.840 --> 01:20:48.840
you are born again you will know yourself and then you have to become. It's a becoming

01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:58.840
that is important, that's a fact. Be careful about born again Christians, oh we have had

01:20:58.840 --> 01:21:04.840
enough of them. They felt quite challenged about Sahaja Yoga because everywhere we went

01:21:04.840 --> 01:21:09.840
they attacked us, everywhere they tried to attack us but when we went to Australia the

01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:14.840
Australians said, now you have done enough of yours, you have got anything from you,

01:21:14.840 --> 01:21:20.840
better they go away. So then they went away. But they are so self deceived also, they live

01:21:20.840 --> 01:21:34.840
with self deception, they know they haven't got anything. What have you got? All right,

01:21:34.840 --> 01:21:40.840
now Gregoire has said, I'm this, I'm that, all right, don't believe in Him, you must get

01:21:40.840 --> 01:21:51.840
something out of Me.

01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:54.762
Another question?

01:21:58.972 --> 01:22:04.060
[question about the difference between self-realisation and God's relisation]

01:22:04.140 --> 01:22:06.790
Is that a Sahaja Yogi?

01:22:12.977 --> 01:22:19.840
Just now let us deal with self-realization.

01:22:20.840 --> 01:22:26.840
That's why Buddha wanted not to speak a word about God, he never wanted to take the name

01:22:26.840 --> 01:22:37.840
of God also. He said, first self, he said, don't talk of God, dangerous situation.

01:22:37.840 --> 01:22:45.810
But in a Sahaja Yoga this thing I'll tell you, not here because people won't understand

01:22:45.840 --> 01:22:57.840
when I tell them about chakras, better is to keep this for future, all right? Look at

01:22:57.840 --> 01:23:08.840
the Sahaja Yogis, now they want to have God's realization, that's good.

01:23:15.911 --> 01:23:18.411
[unclear question]

01:23:21.958 --> 01:23:26.598
What is the purpose of our sould. inthe material form?

01:23:26.688 --> 01:23:42.840
Oh, it's a long story. Human beings created the purpose, in a way like a diamond lost

01:23:42.840 --> 01:23:52.840
in the mire. We can say Adam and Eve, it started. There would have been no need to

01:23:52.840 --> 01:24:02.840
go through all this, but human beings wanted to know everything. They wanted to know the

01:24:02.840 --> 01:24:11.840
sting of a scorpion, they wanted to know the bite of a snake and then they wanted to come

01:24:11.840 --> 01:24:17.840
to God. All right, you have your own way, you have freedom. That's freedom nobody can

01:24:17.840 --> 01:24:23.840
take away, that's given to you, do what you like. So instead of eating your food directly

01:24:23.840 --> 01:24:34.840
like this, as I say, they started eating. What can you do? That's the human doing, not

01:24:34.840 --> 01:24:47.840
of God. It could have been very short circuited but it was so, all right. But that doesn't

01:24:47.840 --> 01:24:59.840
mean that your body is not required. Everything is required very much because the process

01:24:59.840 --> 01:25:06.840
is such. Supposing if you have a chance of making a fruit, a seed into a fruit, just

01:25:06.840 --> 01:25:11.840
in the laboratory, put the seed and it becomes the fruit. All right, then you don't have

01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:23.840
the whole process. But if the process is this way, better have it. Next, next time one can

01:25:23.840 --> 01:25:30.840
try that. But let's finish the process now. We're coming to the end of it. There's a

01:25:30.840 --> 01:25:46.840
trouble now we can't go back, can we? We are, I mean, trying to. We cannot. All right.

01:25:46.840 --> 01:25:52.840
Is there any other question from Sahaja Yogis, as we could? But don't ask such questions

01:25:52.840 --> 01:26:10.509
that I can't answer here. Please. Yes, please, again.

01:26:14.929 --> 01:26:21.535
[unclear question]

01:26:21.785 --> 01:26:26.675
Is it wrong to assume that the sould in this life if the mind in the next life?

01:26:27.755 --> 01:26:38.687
I didn't follow this. Mind in this life or next life? Oh, I understand. Now I've understood.

01:26:38.840 --> 01:26:49.840
No, no, no, no, no, no. You see, soul is different from spirit. Spirit is the light of the soul,

01:26:49.840 --> 01:27:03.840
all right? Let's differentiate it. And then the soul is, all the five elements that are

01:27:03.840 --> 01:27:14.840
within us, they form the soul. And the light of the soul is the spirit, all right? No,

01:27:14.840 --> 01:27:21.840
no, no. But it doesn't transform from one to another. There's no transformation between

01:27:21.840 --> 01:27:31.840
this to that, all right? So today's mind becomes a spirit. Next life, as you are saying, how?

01:27:31.840 --> 01:27:42.840
Because today's mind realizes that mind is not sufficient. So it ascends to the spirit

01:27:42.840 --> 01:27:53.840
root, to the self root, all right? Through the mind it acquires the understanding, the

01:27:53.840 --> 01:28:03.840
logic that you have to ascend. But it doesn't come out of your mind. It comes out of the

01:28:03.840 --> 01:28:12.840
mind of God Almighty, the Spirit, which is untarnishable, unchangeable. But by following

01:28:12.840 --> 01:28:22.840
your mind you realize that mind is not the last one. Or same with emotions. So many people

01:28:22.840 --> 01:28:27.840
who have failed in their emotional life, in a way, are specially blessed because they

01:28:27.840 --> 01:28:43.840
give up that kind of a madness and achieve Spirit. But it's not the same. It's very

01:28:43.840 --> 01:28:51.840
detached. It's not attached to any elements. Spirit is detached from all emotions. It can

01:28:51.840 --> 01:29:05.840
see everything but is detached. I followed your question, all right, isn't it? You

01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:16.840
understood it? You got your answer, all right? That's it, I'm happy. It's a good question

01:29:16.840 --> 01:29:26.840
but it was rather abridged form of a question but I managed it somehow. Now I'm happy

01:29:26.840 --> 01:29:33.840
because sometimes, you know, you people are so alert that you ask very nice questions

01:29:33.840 --> 01:29:47.840
but I'm not so intelligent, I must confess, as you people are because I don't use My

01:29:47.840 --> 01:30:04.840
mind at all. But you can reach the point very easily if you have your Spirit intact

01:30:04.840 --> 01:30:11.840
because it's light. Intelligence, if it is pure intelligence, what you call, that's

01:30:11.840 --> 01:30:19.840
the intelligence of the Spirit. You just reach the point, exactly. But the intelligence

01:30:19.840 --> 01:30:25.840
that we understand is very different, you see. It plays with the words, it baffles you,

01:30:25.840 --> 01:30:38.840
it's brilliant, your eyes can get completely shut with that. But it's not pure intelligence.

01:30:38.840 --> 01:30:59.840
Pure intelligence just gives you the absolute essence of everything. That's the intelligence

01:30:59.840 --> 01:31:16.840
of the Spirit, not of the mind.

01:31:16.840 --> 01:31:20.310
Any other question please? 

01:31:31.870 --> 01:31:41.814
Hugo? Is he there? Any German question? The way, questions also

01:31:41.840 --> 01:31:49.840
of denominations, aren't they? Let us be in a very pleasant mood. I'm trying to bring

01:31:49.840 --> 01:31:55.840
you to a pleasant mood. Please be in a pleasant mood. Now, is there any question?

01:32:00.905 --> 01:32:11.708
[Hindi]

01:32:16.290 --> 01:32:20.290
Yes, madam?

01:32:22.739 --> 01:32:25.239
[unclear question]

01:32:41.840 --> 01:32:46.345
How did I know? There's a German lurking

01:32:48.405 --> 01:32:50.255
somewhere. Now explain, what does she say?

01:32:52.005 --> 01:32:53.801
Why we are on this Earth?

01:32:53.830 --> 01:33:06.305
Because God wanted you to be here? 

01:33:12.325 --> 01:33:13.550
There must be another reason.

01:33:13.625 --> 01:33:18.744
Of course, the reason is, is the reflection of God's

01:33:18.840 --> 01:33:27.840
will, that He wanted us to be here. It's not according to our reasoning that God moves.

01:33:27.840 --> 01:33:34.840
He has His own reasons, that He wanted to have something, so He has it. He wants

01:33:34.840 --> 01:33:42.840
to have His children. Why do you have a child? Because you want to have, you want to enjoy

01:33:42.840 --> 01:33:50.840
and cherish. That's what God wanted, to enjoy and cherish the love of His children, as the

01:33:50.840 --> 01:33:57.778
child loves you. You see, the answer is here.

01:34:07.778 --> 01:34:20.840
See, he is a realized soul and he is clearing her chakras. So My intelligence is with him,

01:34:20.840 --> 01:34:29.840
collect. He's clearly clearing your this chakra and he understands. Was he the

01:34:29.840 --> 01:34:32.840
realized soul?

01:34:40.899 --> 01:34:45.987
You're asking for their Self-realization.

01:34:49.187 --> 01:34:51.273
They are asking for their self-realisation.

01:34:51.380 --> 01:35:07.782
That's great, that's your right. That's very, very great. All right, let's have it.

01:35:07.840 --> 01:35:17.840
But all the twenty who are here, I have to make a humble request that please respect

01:35:17.840 --> 01:35:34.840
your realization, please. Sometimes I weep with frustration and I request you to understand

01:35:34.840 --> 01:35:41.840
your value and worth in the light of the Spirit. Thank you.

01:35:42.840 --> 01:35:47.840
Could you please take out your shoes and sit with your two feet on the ground without crossing

01:35:47.840 --> 01:35:57.840
the legs and be comfortable, don't have anything which make you feel tight and put your two

01:35:57.840 --> 01:36:04.840
hands in the direction of Shri Mataji with the palms upwards. Thank you.

01:36:04.840 --> 01:36:08.840
But the new people should come forward and the Sahaja Yogis must give them room because

01:36:08.840 --> 01:36:10.840
you see we have to look after them.

01:36:10.840 --> 01:36:16.840
So please all the people who are here for the first time, would you please?

01:36:16.840 --> 01:36:18.840
Come in the forward seat.

01:36:18.840 --> 01:36:23.840
Just come on the forward seat and every Sahaja Yogi were on the forward seat, please the

01:36:23.840 --> 01:36:30.840
first seat. Please move backwards. And we are speaking about the seats not on the ground.

01:36:30.840 --> 01:36:35.840
So all the new people please sit on the first row of seats.

01:36:38.840 --> 01:36:50.840
That's great. She's going to start a center in Wimbledon. Let's see. Hope for the best.

01:36:50.840 --> 01:36:57.840
Keep your fingers crossed. Such vibrations.

01:36:58.840 --> 01:37:02.840
It's better to be there because they'll go into cramps.

01:37:03.840 --> 01:37:07.840
If this is not enough also on the second row, please Sahaja Yogis, can you leave the second

01:37:07.840 --> 01:37:09.840
row free?

01:37:10.840 --> 01:37:14.840
Such vibrations, boy, you don't know the idea of Wimbledon.

01:37:14.840 --> 01:37:21.840
Tremendous vibrations. Too much vibrations. Yes, good.

01:37:26.220 --> 01:37:31.982
Sahaja Yogis should move from the second row and let people who are new should sit there.

01:37:32.020 --> 01:37:38.020
Please move from the second and the first row also, I mean.

01:37:55.506 --> 01:37:59.840
Please can you just, as I said, put your two feet on the ground straight without crossing

01:37:59.840 --> 01:38:04.840
the legs and put your two hands with the palm upwards in the direction of Shri Mataji.

01:38:04.840 --> 01:38:08.840
If you are sitting on the ground there's nothing to worry about the feet being on the

01:38:08.840 --> 01:38:13.840
ground. Then you are on the ground but those who are sitting on the chair, please put both

01:38:13.840 --> 01:38:19.840
your feet like this on the Mother Earth because she sucks in the problems you have and put

01:38:19.922 --> 01:38:23.840
both the hands like this towards Me.

01:38:38.840 --> 01:38:43.840
Now you have to close your eyes, just close your eyes.

01:38:53.588 --> 01:39:01.840
You don't open your eyes till I tell you to open your eyes. So you just keep your eyes

01:39:01.840 --> 01:39:03.840
shut.

01:39:07.840 --> 01:39:18.840
Now left hand is symbolic of our desire, desire power. So we are putting our desire, left

01:39:18.840 --> 01:39:29.840
hand, asking for our Self-realization. So keep it all the time, left hand towards Me.

01:39:30.840 --> 01:39:39.840
Right hand is the power of action, Kriya shakti. So you have to use the right hand for that

01:39:39.840 --> 01:39:48.840
and so you have to put your right hand onto different centers which I will explain to

01:39:48.840 --> 01:39:55.840
you very, in a very simple way and you'll be able to understand that you have to put

01:39:55.840 --> 01:40:01.840
your hand on these centers, helping your Kundalini to rise.

01:40:01.840 --> 01:40:10.840
Now we are working out only on the left hand side of our centers with our right hand. So

01:40:10.840 --> 01:40:17.840
the left hand is towards Me and the right hand goes onto different centers that we have,

01:40:17.840 --> 01:40:26.840
as simple as that. The first one is the one what we call is the seat of the Spirit which

01:40:26.840 --> 01:40:35.840
is the heart, which is on the left hand side. So please put your left hand towards Me all

01:40:35.840 --> 01:40:50.840
the time and the right hand on the heart. Now just on the heart. Now at this place you

01:40:50.840 --> 01:41:03.840
have to ask Me a very fundamental question, Mother, if you call Me Shri Mataji, Her Mother

01:41:03.840 --> 01:41:13.840
is the same, Mother, am I the Spirit? Is a fundamental question, just ask Me. Mother,

01:41:13.840 --> 01:41:40.840
am I the Spirit? Ask this question three times, Mother, am I the Spirit?

01:41:40.840 --> 01:41:47.840
So one has to know that if you become the Spirit you become your own guide, you become

01:41:47.840 --> 01:41:52.840
your own guru. This is all created by the great prophets and great gurus within you,

01:41:52.840 --> 01:42:01.840
the possibility. So now after this you take down your right hand onto your stomach on

01:42:01.840 --> 01:42:17.840
the left hand side. This is the center of mastery, mastery of the Divine power, the

01:42:17.840 --> 01:42:26.840
technique, how to use it. So here you have to ask another question, relevant with the

01:42:26.840 --> 01:42:33.840
first one, that if I am the Spirit, am I my own master? Ask a question now three times,

01:42:33.840 --> 01:42:41.840
Mother, am I my own master? Put your left hand towards Me and right hand on the left

01:42:41.840 --> 01:42:52.840
hand side of your stomach in the upper part. In the upper part of your stomach on the left

01:42:52.840 --> 01:42:59.840
hand side, please put your right hand and press it. And here you ask Me a question three

01:42:59.840 --> 01:43:14.840
times, Mother, am I my own master? Am I my own guide? Am I my own guru? This is the blessings

01:43:14.840 --> 01:43:40.840
of the real sadhgurus. Three times.

01:43:40.840 --> 01:43:51.840
Now please take your hand in the lower part of your abdomen on the left hand side. Now

01:43:51.840 --> 01:44:02.840
press it hard. This is the center that works out. First one was the master. This is the

01:44:02.840 --> 01:44:17.840
center that works out, the Divine technique of the true knowledge, of the pure knowledge.

01:44:17.840 --> 01:44:30.840
So now ask a question. In a way it's not a question but a request, because unless and

01:44:30.840 --> 01:44:39.840
until you ask for it, I cannot do it, I cannot cross your freedom. So here you say, Mother,

01:44:39.840 --> 01:44:50.840
please may I have the pure knowledge? Mother, may I have the pure knowledge? Say it three

01:44:50.840 --> 01:45:00.840
times. Mother, may I have the pure knowledge? Six times, because this center has got six

01:45:00.840 --> 01:45:09.840
petals. Now this you are asking to initiate the Kundalini, to awaken the Kundalini. When

01:45:09.840 --> 01:45:16.840
you ask for it, because it's such an absolute question, the Kundalini awakens. You have

01:45:16.840 --> 01:45:30.840
to request Her.

01:45:30.840 --> 01:45:55.840
Now, again raise your hand to the upper portion or upper area of the stomach, on the left

01:45:55.840 --> 01:46:07.840
hand side, at the center of the mastery. Here you press it hard and say with full confidence

01:46:07.840 --> 01:46:21.840
for the Kundalini to rise, to open the center with full assertion, Mother, I am my own master.

01:46:21.840 --> 01:46:40.840
Mother, I am my own master. You have to say this ten times, because there are ten masters

01:46:40.840 --> 01:46:50.840
within us, who have built up our ten centers, subplexuses of these solar plexus. So we have

01:46:50.840 --> 01:47:14.774
to say ten times, with full assertion, Mother, I am my own master.

01:47:30.874 --> 01:47:39.813
Now, raise your right hand on to the heart.

01:47:39.840 --> 01:47:49.840
Here again, with full confidence within yourself, forgetting all your past, forgetting all your

01:47:49.840 --> 01:47:59.840
problems, with full confidence and assertion, you have to say, Mother, I am the Spirit.

01:47:59.840 --> 01:48:06.840
You have to say it twelve times, Mother, I am the Spirit. You are the Spirit, no doubt

01:48:06.840 --> 01:48:09.793
about it.

01:48:18.710 --> 01:48:30.840
Believe in yourself, have faith in yourself. Know that you are the Spirit and nothing else.

01:49:25.390 --> 01:49:30.746
Now, raise your right hand in the corner of your head.

01:49:30.840 --> 01:49:43.840
If you have left shoulder and your neck from the front, this is the most difficult center

01:49:43.840 --> 01:49:51.840
that we have in the West, because people believe in something called the guilt, and all the

01:49:51.840 --> 01:50:04.840
time they feel guilty for nothing at all. So put it in the corner of the neck and the

01:50:04.840 --> 01:50:19.840
shoulder, press it hard on the backbone, hard. This is the worst center we have in the West,

01:50:19.840 --> 01:50:26.840
that we feel guilty for nothing at all. What is the feeling guilty? You are the Spirit.

01:50:26.840 --> 01:50:36.840
How can Spirit make mistakes? And God is the ocean of love and compassion, but above all

01:50:36.840 --> 01:50:44.840
He's the ocean of forgiveness. What guilt can you have? What mistakes can you commit

01:50:44.840 --> 01:50:53.840
that His power of forgiveness cannot forgive? You are not to be guilty. Forget My lecture,

01:50:53.840 --> 01:51:18.248
forget everything, you are the pure, immaculate Spirit. You are sat-chit-ananda. You are the source

01:51:18.278 --> 01:51:43.820
of all that is joy.

01:51:47.190 --> 01:51:56.786
Better. You have to say this sixteen times, Mother, I am not guilty. Sixteen times, press

01:51:56.840 --> 01:52:19.840
it hard and say it sixteen times.

01:52:25.910 --> 01:52:43.770
So in the beginning it was terrible.

01:52:52.260 --> 01:53:03.840
Now take this hand and put it across your forehead, please. Stretch your left hand towards

01:53:03.840 --> 01:53:15.840
Me. At this point, not how many times, but from your heart you have to say, Mother, I

01:53:15.840 --> 01:53:26.840
forgive everyone. Something that's very difficult to forgive, it's a myth, because

01:53:26.840 --> 01:53:31.840
whether you forgive or not forgive you don't do anything about it. But if you don't forgive

01:53:31.840 --> 01:53:39.840
then you play into the wrong hands. So please say, Mother, I forgive. That's the greatest

01:53:39.840 --> 01:53:50.840
weapon you have. Mother, I forgive.

01:53:50.840 --> 01:54:17.840
Everyone, first of all yourself. Now on the back of your head, hold it tight. Now for

01:54:17.840 --> 01:54:28.840
your own consolation you can say that, O God Almighty, or O my Kundalini the Mother,

01:54:28.840 --> 01:54:46.840
if I have done anything wrong in Your glory, in Your name, please forgive me. Not to feel

01:54:46.840 --> 01:54:52.840
guilty at all, please don't feel guilty, but just say it out, don't count all your

01:54:52.840 --> 01:54:58.840
so-called sins, just forget it, forget it, forget it.

01:54:58.840 --> 01:55:10.840
Now, raise your hand on top of your head, on the fontanel bone area, stretch your palm

01:55:10.840 --> 01:55:17.840
and press it hard in a clockwise manner. Take your right hand on top of your head,

01:55:17.840 --> 01:55:27.840
on the fontanel bone area, which was a soft bone in your childhood, press it hard and

01:55:27.840 --> 01:55:39.840
here in a clockwise manner when you move it you have to say something which I cannot do

01:55:39.840 --> 01:55:46.840
it without it because you are free. So you have to say, Mother, I want my realization,

01:55:46.840 --> 01:55:53.840
I cannot force on you. So to say, I want my realization, Mother, please give me my self-realization.

01:55:53.840 --> 01:56:00.840
Just say that, press it hard, press it hard, stretch your palm on top of fontanel bone

01:56:00.840 --> 01:56:07.840
area. Now, seven times.

01:56:08.470 --> 01:56:21.339
[Shri Mataji blows into the microphone]

01:56:57.012 --> 01:57:01.262
Now bring down your right hand, please.

01:57:01.840 --> 01:57:13.840
The most valuable moment of your life and the most precious, important happening. Now,

01:57:13.840 --> 01:57:19.840
please place your right hand towards Me and left hand on top of your head, bending the

01:57:19.840 --> 01:57:27.840
head about, say, three, four inches and move the hand and see if there's any cool breeze

01:57:27.840 --> 01:57:31.840
coming out of your own head, please.

01:57:34.840 --> 01:57:43.840
It was really nice to have this seminar organized here at such a short notice with no proper

01:57:43.840 --> 01:57:49.840
planning or anything and you got such a nice place also. Spontaneously the whole thing

01:57:49.840 --> 01:57:59.840
has worked out and everything is managed. But today you saw the new people who came

01:57:59.840 --> 01:58:14.840
were an example of the dearth of seeking in this country, or maybe. There is some sort

01:58:14.840 --> 01:58:26.840
of lacking on the part of English Sahaja Yogis also. The way that, because I'm here, people

01:58:26.840 --> 01:58:35.840
take things for granted. Or maybe that a few like Gavin and others are very anxious, trying

01:58:35.840 --> 01:58:46.840
to do their level best to do this. And I think on two points might be we are failing.

01:58:46.840 --> 01:58:57.840
One point is that we all must know what have we done for Sahaja Yoga. Some people take

01:58:57.840 --> 01:59:06.840
two or three posters and post them, then they think they have done everything. No.

01:59:06.840 --> 01:59:14.840
You have to do much more than anywhere else because you are placed in this important thing

01:59:14.840 --> 01:59:22.840
called the heart. Everybody has had an advantage of Sahaja Yoga, has been helped a lot. We

01:59:23.840 --> 01:59:31.840
have to think what have we done for Sahaja Yoga. It has done so much for us, what have

01:59:31.840 --> 01:59:41.840
we done for Sahaja Yoga. That's very important. So then there should be, I think I was expressing

01:59:41.840 --> 01:59:50.840
that anxiety which the people who are your leaders and those who are worried about Sahaja

01:59:50.840 --> 02:00:01.840
Yoga in England. And My lecture, the whole lecture has that tremendous concern. And then

02:00:01.840 --> 02:00:06.840
we have to think what have we done. We have houses, we have places, we have ashrams, we

02:00:06.840 --> 02:00:12.840
have families, we have wives, we have everything. And the Sahaja Yoga still if it is by the

02:00:12.840 --> 02:00:19.840
way then this is the result. You get twenty nonsensical, arrogant people, don't get

02:00:19.840 --> 02:00:27.840
realization, some of them get it and get out. So I think this is on one side is this that

02:00:27.840 --> 02:00:32.840
what have we done for Sahaja Yoga. There should be a, in other countries I'm not there. So

02:00:32.840 --> 02:00:39.840
for them when I go there, even for four, five days, the whole place is filled with My, the

02:00:39.840 --> 02:00:46.840
whole place is filled with My posters, the whole place. It has to be done, every time

02:00:46.840 --> 02:00:54.840
has been. The whole of London should have been today filled with My posters. I mean

02:00:54.840 --> 02:01:03.840
anybody who goes to say Switzerland or to Rome or to Paris, they tell Me, Indians, that

02:01:03.840 --> 02:01:12.840
we saw your posters all over the place. But never has happened in London. Now I hope this

02:01:12.840 --> 02:01:20.840
is not the last program, public program in England. But still one has to work very hard.

02:01:20.840 --> 02:01:28.840
All of you should think what you can do because everybody has taken things in their own style

02:01:28.840 --> 02:01:35.840
like the leaders are working hard, they are all trying to do things and arrange things,

02:01:35.840 --> 02:01:43.840
all that. But what have you done is the point. Now some people have had failures, say for

02:01:43.840 --> 02:01:49.840
example some people had failures with the officials and for the government or with the

02:01:49.840 --> 02:01:54.840
TV, doesn't matter. We know we have failed there. But advertising, postering, talking

02:01:54.840 --> 02:02:02.840
about it, going around it, all that can be done. This one part is very good in this respect

02:02:02.840 --> 02:02:08.840
is that outside London things are working out better. But how many of you have been

02:02:08.840 --> 02:02:20.840
doing that? Very few. The same party goes here, same party has to do it all the time.

02:02:20.840 --> 02:02:27.840
Now, now this is one side of the picture is that, that the advertising and all that

02:02:27.840 --> 02:02:35.840
has to be done more intensely, extensively. And everybody must offer their full support

02:02:35.840 --> 02:02:43.840
and services. On the seminar side you are all very good, everything is done well, I

02:02:43.840 --> 02:02:48.840
agree. So many things are, because we have to do so many things together. But still you

02:02:49.840 --> 02:02:57.840
being the heart you have to be like that, what can you do? That's one part of it.

02:02:57.840 --> 02:03:04.840
The second part of it I feel is, like we had in Hampstead about three hundred people and

02:03:04.840 --> 02:03:15.840
they came and what I've learnt is that when they came to the program nobody was sort of

02:03:15.840 --> 02:03:21.840
open hearted, sort of talked to them in that way as they should have. Some of you did but

02:03:21.840 --> 02:03:26.840
not all. Most of you are just sitting down. Like if they come to My house they'll just

02:03:26.840 --> 02:03:34.840
sit down, hands like this. You cannot, you cannot just do that, it's not done. Come

02:03:34.840 --> 02:03:40.840
to My house, sit down like this. Always they will come and sit down and put hands like

02:03:40.840 --> 02:03:49.840
this. You can't do like that. That shows you are very insular, very selfish and also

02:03:49.840 --> 02:03:59.840
in a way arrogant. You cannot take My vibrations without My permission, can you?

02:03:59.840 --> 02:04:08.840
So this is suggestive of one thing, that what we do is to take things for granted and we,

02:04:08.840 --> 02:04:15.840
when we talk to others also it takes time for an Englishman to get up. That's the

02:04:15.840 --> 02:04:23.840
thing is. Now the quality of this is this, that in English do not want to interfere with

02:04:23.840 --> 02:04:28.840
anyone, they want to leave them alone. It's not the bad thing. They want that why should

02:04:28.840 --> 02:04:34.840
we interfere, aggress, that's the point is. But that's not the point now, we have

02:04:34.840 --> 02:04:39.840
to aggress. This is the thing I'm bringing you to. That means you don't mean that.

02:04:39.840 --> 02:04:45.840
But what you mean is that not to interfere. See they don't discuss religion in England,

02:04:45.840 --> 02:04:51.840
no, you are not supposed to say these things. You are not to discuss whether you are a miss

02:04:51.840 --> 02:04:57.840
or a missus. You are not to say whether you have children or not. If you ask somebody

02:04:57.840 --> 02:05:02.840
a question, you have you got children, that means the most offensive thing. You are not

02:05:02.840 --> 02:05:08.840
to discuss anybody's family. There are so many don'ts in this country so that we do

02:05:08.840 --> 02:05:18.840
not also sort of get up worried that maybe this may be taken as an interference. But

02:05:18.840 --> 02:05:25.840
just the opposite are Americans. They will go up to the great grandfather and up to the

02:05:25.840 --> 02:05:33.840
whole progeny to find out. So interference should be forgotten, there should be no fear

02:05:33.840 --> 02:05:39.840
about them. But open your heart and talk to them openly with an open heart. But people

02:05:39.840 --> 02:05:45.840
receive back. Once they receive back, others also somehow or other get frightened because

02:05:45.840 --> 02:05:53.840
they think you are just like them. You have to be different to attract them.

02:05:53.840 --> 02:06:00.840
So amongst English Sahaja Yogis there are some who are very anxious, very much worried,

02:06:00.840 --> 02:06:07.840
they are being so much, working it out. Some of them are really indifferent and the middle

02:06:07.840 --> 02:06:15.840
part is those who are still trying to see how far to go, how far not to go, you have

02:06:15.840 --> 02:06:23.840
to be aggressive about it. I mean as if now I feel the English have aggressed so much

02:06:23.840 --> 02:06:29.840
that now they are so fed up with aggressiveness. That's the thing I want you to have today,

02:06:29.840 --> 02:06:36.840
to be aggress. Aggressiveness is the only way you can reach these people, otherwise

02:06:36.840 --> 02:06:42.840
they won't understand. And you have to talk to them on their faces. I have seen how people

02:06:42.840 --> 02:06:47.840
talk. If you talk to them like that they are all right. Unless and until you work out

02:06:47.840 --> 02:06:53.840
that way, when the people come, you talk to them in an aggressively loving manner. Do

02:06:53.840 --> 02:07:01.840
you understand that? Exuberance, just open out your heart. How come long, come long,

02:07:01.840 --> 02:07:07.840
where are you going, sit down, what do you want, you want. One minute Englishman will

02:07:07.840 --> 02:07:16.840
look like this, you see. Second minute, you must understand your own character that exists

02:07:16.840 --> 02:07:27.840
in those people also. If the language starts, I'm afraid. So aggressively compassionate,

02:07:27.840 --> 02:07:42.840
aggressively loving, aggressively open hearted. Non-interference and all those ideas are out

02:07:42.840 --> 02:07:59.840
of date now, finished. Now openness, no arrogance, no anger, but openness. Aggressive innocence

02:07:59.840 --> 02:08:11.840
people, like children are. Children are so aggressively innocent that you like it. I

02:08:11.840 --> 02:08:16.840
mean if they catch hold of you, they'll all come and jump on your body and sleep on

02:08:16.840 --> 02:08:28.840
top of you, kissing you all over. That's how. You have to be aggressively loving and

02:08:28.840 --> 02:08:34.840
aggressively good. What you want, you want something to eat, you want this, that, that.

02:08:34.840 --> 02:08:41.840
They'll be surprised how these English people have become like this. So on these two things

02:08:41.840 --> 02:08:50.840
we fail and this anguish and this anxiety that I have is one of the expressions of the

02:08:50.840 --> 02:08:56.840
modern times, you must know, is of the modern times, you see. Because modern times are so

02:08:56.840 --> 02:09:02.840
funny that if you click it, you click it and if you don't click it, missed. It's so

02:09:02.840 --> 02:09:10.840
important, so precarious is the word, so precarious. At this time if you don't click it, it's finished.

02:09:10.840 --> 02:09:20.840
So I find everyone is capable of doing lots of things for Sahaja Yoga. But

02:09:20.840 --> 02:09:26.840
what have we done for Sahaja Yoga? Nice in the seminar to come and enjoy, it's good idea,

02:09:26.840 --> 02:09:33.840
I enjoy Sahaja Yogis, Mother is collecting them. One of the examples is that from the

02:09:33.840 --> 02:09:40.840
other countries people come. They are sick, they have problems, this, that. Immediately

02:09:40.840 --> 02:09:51.840
telephone will ring Me up saying, Mother somebody has come with ten bhoots and fifteen babhoots.

02:09:51.840 --> 02:10:02.840
So what? When should that person see you? I said, the person or the bhoots? And the bhoots

02:10:02.840 --> 02:10:13.840
only come, the person is missing. At least you can reduce some numbers and then send

02:10:13.840 --> 02:10:24.840
such a person. Now I've started using the hearth of My house instead of the candle.

02:10:24.840 --> 02:10:32.840
Now will you please look after the bhoots of the people when they come? And among you

02:10:32.840 --> 02:10:38.840
are, there are many like that. Your children are caught up, some of the wives are caught

02:10:38.840 --> 02:10:47.840
up, some of the husbands are caught up, but nobody pays attention, carrying on with them,

02:10:47.840 --> 02:10:55.840
sometimes even supporting. And just I see them, even staying in ashrams I must say,

02:10:55.840 --> 02:11:03.840
some of them are really bhootish and troublesome. And you think that you have to tolerate, there's

02:11:03.840 --> 02:11:10.840
no crucifixion needed anymore. If somebody has a bhoot, better tell that person you are

02:11:10.840 --> 02:11:17.840
catching. I mean I don't want to tell, but you know what happens to Me? My hands and

02:11:17.840 --> 02:11:24.840
My feet they all go crazy, and there's a bhootish person around, so I just run away.

02:11:24.840 --> 02:11:29.840
In the same way it should happen to you and you should try to correct that person, but

02:11:29.840 --> 02:11:36.840
nobody bothers. You see because you think correction will be too much, oh maybe he might

02:11:36.840 --> 02:11:43.840
feel hurt and he'll run away. Let him run away, take two running jumps and go to hell.

02:11:43.840 --> 02:11:50.840
But the whole thing should be a concern and anxiety and loving way, then you will attract

02:11:50.840 --> 02:11:57.840
that person. I mean today I was really so full of vibrations, nothing would be sucked

02:11:57.840 --> 02:12:03.840
in. These horrible twenty people or so ever they were, they were stopping you also from

02:12:03.840 --> 02:12:10.840
sucking Me. I mean they were more powerful than you are in your suction I think. So now

02:12:10.840 --> 02:12:15.840
there's something wrong with us. What is that wrong is, what have we done for Sahaja

02:12:15.840 --> 02:12:22.840
Yoga, first question. Second is what am I doing about myself, where am I? Nice to ask

02:12:22.840 --> 02:12:27.840
a question, what's the difference between a God realized and a Self realized? God realized

02:12:27.840 --> 02:12:49.840
never catches, just knows. Now why do I feel horrible? Only with Sahaja Yogis, not with

02:12:49.840 --> 02:12:56.840
non-Sahaja Yogis. Even a Narakasura comes before Me, I can kill him. But Sahaja Yogis

02:12:56.840 --> 02:13:02.840
are inside My body, what am I to do? They are part and parcel of Me, they are not foreigners.

02:13:02.840 --> 02:13:07.840
So when they get sick I get sick Myself, because they are inside Myself. No deity has done

02:13:07.840 --> 02:13:16.840
that, no incarnation has done that job. Nobody has injected Sahaja Yogis inside their body,

02:13:16.840 --> 02:13:24.840
has anyone done that way? You are all inside My body, part and parcel. When something goes

02:13:24.840 --> 02:13:29.840
wrong with you, goes wrong with Me inside naturally, if I take a, it's indiscriminate

02:13:29.840 --> 02:13:36.840
you can say, but if I were not indiscriminate, how many would have gone inside My body? That's

02:13:36.840 --> 02:13:43.840
how I can cleanse you. I can look after you, I can know about your work out things very

02:13:43.840 --> 02:13:48.840
well. Something happens to someone in Australia, I can work it out here because he's in My

02:13:48.840 --> 02:14:02.840
body. That's why I get sick. Or you can say I get caught up, because I've got bhoots

02:14:02.840 --> 02:14:10.840
within Me. So you must keep out your bhoots. This is the third point, very important. How

02:14:10.840 --> 02:14:17.840
can I have bhoots in Me? How can I have left side or right side or anything? I am in the

02:14:17.840 --> 02:14:25.840
body of Mother, who is the Adi Shakti. What a privilege, what a honor. So now I can't

02:14:25.830 --> 02:14:36.830
have any bhoots within Myself. It has to be something very pure. So try to purify yourself,

02:14:36.840 --> 02:14:43.840
keep yourself pure. What I'm saying now is for English, is for all of you. English

02:14:43.840 --> 02:14:49.840
being always the leaders for starting something good, I have to talk to them more. They have

02:14:49.840 --> 02:14:56.840
done it because they were the ones who fought the war, won it, and that's how we started

02:14:56.840 --> 02:15:05.840
under tides. But now the instruments that we are going to use have to be that powerful.

02:15:05.840 --> 02:15:12.840
If Europeans among them say Brussels people come up very well, then I'll shift My attention.

02:15:12.840 --> 02:15:24.840
We can shift heart these days. Transplant is possible. Have you heard of heart from

02:15:24.840 --> 02:15:33.840
right moves to the left or left to the right? God can do it. There are people born with

02:15:33.840 --> 02:15:45.840
the heart on the right hand side also. So to be very precise, I think that this seminar

02:15:45.840 --> 02:16:07.840
should be used for also having an inner inside, seeing what have we done for Sahaja Yoga.

02:16:07.840 --> 02:16:24.840
That will help. Secondly, very important is, are we open hearted? For example, we can

02:16:24.840 --> 02:16:36.840
say like this, that supposing I'm in the house and the bell rings up. If there's an American,

02:16:36.840 --> 02:16:41.840
he'll say, I'll get it, will be the first to run. And English would be looking this

02:16:41.840 --> 02:16:51.840
side, that side. Because a kind of a lethargy, that is certainly. Because that's the idea

02:16:51.840 --> 02:17:03.840
of the negative to freeze the heart. And that freezing is to be avoided. I'll get it,

02:17:03.840 --> 02:17:16.840
I'll do it, I'll work it out. I have to do it. That must be told. All the English

02:17:16.840 --> 02:17:21.840
Sahaja Yogis must know that they have to be the most active people. Do you know, even

02:17:21.840 --> 02:17:32.840
when we sleep and the heart is beating all the time till we exist. So I have to tell

02:17:32.840 --> 02:17:37.840
you that you bear a very big responsibility to Sahaja Yoga. That's why I've been here,

02:17:37.840 --> 02:17:45.840
I've been with you and that doesn't mean you should take things for granted. You can

02:17:45.840 --> 02:17:53.840
do a lot, you have to circulate. Maybe English Sahaja Yogis will have to travel a lot. But

02:17:53.840 --> 02:18:09.840
first of all, first and foremost, open your heart. Talk openly and sweetly. You have children,

02:18:09.840 --> 02:18:20.840
learn from them how they talk, how sweetly they move. Really open your heart. Unless

02:18:20.840 --> 02:18:29.840
and until you open your heart, how can you do anything for anybody else? And that's

02:18:29.840 --> 02:18:45.840
what one has to achieve. I'm sure next program I can see myself all over London. All right?

02:18:49.820 --> 02:18:58.840
Now don't feel guilty, I'm getting terrible pain. Don't feel guilty. Face it. Yes, it's

02:18:58.840 --> 02:19:03.840
true. Don't feel guilty about it. For heaven's sake don't feel guilty because I'm now

02:19:03.840 --> 02:19:13.840
getting a terrible pain again. Food has arrived, all right?

02:19:13.840 --> 02:19:19.840
So we can have some music, all right? Then I'll go because tomorrow I have to come

02:19:19.840 --> 02:19:25.840
for your puja. So if you don't mind, tomorrow about eleven o'clock we'll start the puja.

02:19:25.840 --> 02:19:29.840
But those who have to cancel their thing, I hope you manage that tomorrow. I bless you

02:19:29.840 --> 02:19:32.840
with that. May God bless you.

02:19:44.840 --> 02:19:51.840
We can start at ten o'clock. We can start puja at ten. I mean for Me it's all right,

02:19:51.840 --> 02:20:02.840
I can even start at nine. But what about you people? I can start at six. Or just now.

02:20:03.840 --> 02:20:12.840
No, but what about others? No, it's better to have it before me. No, it's, you see,

02:20:12.840 --> 02:20:17.840
actually it's, there is, I don't know what sort of puja it is going to be because, see,

02:20:17.840 --> 02:20:22.840
it's a Vishnu maya, this thing, you see. So we can have a short puja of Vishnu maya,

02:20:22.840 --> 02:20:30.840
it's all right. It has to be done in the night, no doubt, in the sense that, but doesn't

02:20:30.840 --> 02:20:39.840
matter, makes no difference. We can call it a global puja, some sort of a general

02:20:39.840 --> 02:20:52.840
puja we can call it, I don't know. Vishnu maya is something so powerful. All right,

02:20:52.840 --> 02:21:00.840
so let's have some music and then I'll go back. Just tell her not to wait for My

02:21:00.840 --> 02:21:08.840
food at home. This girl, need time she should eat her food. So let's see now, what is

02:21:08.840 --> 02:21:14.840
the contribution? Now you have seen the music that has come from Nasik. What a professional

02:21:14.840 --> 02:21:23.840
music it was. Did you hear that? Now what have you to produce? Just look at that. It

02:21:23.840 --> 02:21:30.840
was a real professional thing they have done. So we should try to find out something better,

02:21:30.840 --> 02:21:39.840
all right? Now let's have some music. What do you think, Valerie, Me to Me, you think

02:21:39.840 --> 02:21:40.840
so much?

02:21:41.840 --> 02:21:48.840
All right, all right, all right. What is cooked in? This one and this one?

02:21:51.840 --> 02:21:58.840
Plain, plain one I'll have and that I can have, all right? All right. I'll try to

02:21:58.840 --> 02:22:02.840
manage something. Now let's have some music.

02:24:16.885 --> 02:24:26.840
Now for India tour. You see, this may be there as I told you. I don't know this year

02:24:26.840 --> 02:24:33.840
or maybe next year, maybe the last year, I can't say. The reason is once we have established

02:24:33.840 --> 02:24:40.840
our ashrams in India, I don't think I'll be able to take all this, go round all the

02:24:40.840 --> 02:24:44.840
villages and all that. Once we have ashrams they will all come down to see us there. In

02:24:44.840 --> 02:24:52.840
India for them it's a pilgrimage and they go out of the way to do it. So when you people

02:24:52.840 --> 02:24:59.840
are coming there, after once we have established our ashram, there won't be any of these

02:24:59.840 --> 02:25:06.840
India tours much, which you have enjoyed very well. Maybe this might be the last year

02:25:06.840 --> 02:25:11.840
or next year, I don't know, depends on as soon as we establish the ashram.

02:25:11.840 --> 02:25:25.840
Now, I see that people do not understand the value of Indian tour also. It does lot of good

02:25:25.840 --> 02:25:30.840
to you because it's a country which is heavenly, I should say, as far as vibrations

02:25:30.840 --> 02:25:36.840
are concerned. Sometimes I feel we are living in hell here because I see the TV on horrible

02:25:36.840 --> 02:25:41.840
things and I mean it's really terrible. There are so many Indians who have come here

02:25:41.840 --> 02:25:47.840
and they say that they lose their vibrations, not only here, America anyway. So the Indian

02:25:47.840 --> 02:25:53.840
tour, though apart from anything else, itself is visiting India, is still a clearer country,

02:25:53.840 --> 02:25:55.840
especially Maharashtra is.

02:25:55.840 --> 02:26:03.840
Now, this time to make it convenient, we have made it for three weeks. So you are there

02:26:03.840 --> 02:26:12.840
only for three weeks, two weeks, around, at one week, around the sea shore. Now actually

02:26:12.840 --> 02:26:21.840
we'll not have many public programs, but that is something every year, if you cannot

02:26:21.840 --> 02:26:28.840
do it, at least alternate years should have been done. I find that, that people don't

02:26:28.840 --> 02:26:34.840
understand the importance of Indian tour. Ninety-nine percent people who have been to

02:26:34.840 --> 02:26:42.840
India settle down in Sahaja Yoga. There must be something about it. So those who are going

02:26:42.840 --> 02:26:49.840
to, now we have made it the minimum possible. Though everybody warned us, Warren said that

02:26:49.840 --> 02:26:53.840
it's going to be very expensive, it is ten times more, everything is there, whatever

02:26:53.840 --> 02:27:00.840
minimum we have got. Luckily also Air India, because it had so many accidents, it has gone

02:27:00.840 --> 02:27:07.840
very cheap. And you people should know that if you have to go, pay the money in time.

02:27:07.840 --> 02:27:12.840
You are still waiting for last minute. I'm going to be here for a month, I know that,

02:27:12.840 --> 02:27:18.840
but that doesn't mean that you should take so much time. It's like a pilgrimage.

02:27:19.840 --> 02:27:25.840
And everybody should try, everybody should try. I cannot manage many, but quite a lot

02:27:25.840 --> 02:27:30.840
we can manage now, because we have made two tours now. In case you cannot manage the first

02:27:30.840 --> 02:27:36.840
tour, you come for the second tour. But it's not so difficult. But if you see, I have

02:27:36.840 --> 02:27:45.840
now noticed people quite closely that people waste their money along. Just the other way

02:27:45.840 --> 02:27:54.840
round Indians are, you know, they keep all the money just for My tour there. Keep all

02:27:54.840 --> 02:28:00.840
their holidays, all their money for the tour, though they do not gain so much as you people

02:28:00.840 --> 02:28:10.840
gain, because it's a new world you go to. So those who are coming should decide, but

02:28:10.840 --> 02:28:19.840
those who are not coming also must think it over. It's not difficult. It's better,

02:28:19.840 --> 02:28:25.840
I hope this is not the last time, but maybe, I can't say. Because once we have an ashram

02:28:25.840 --> 02:28:29.840
then why need not go all over the Indians will all come from all over India they'll

02:28:29.840 --> 02:28:33.840
come. People are already coming from Madras, even if I have a small little room they come

02:28:33.840 --> 02:28:39.840
down. Because we have no place to make them stay, that's why. Otherwise you will be

02:28:39.840 --> 02:28:44.840
surprised they will be all there. You won't be able to see yourself, there will be so

02:28:44.840 --> 02:28:52.840
many. Before that starts you must understand that you have to go to India, somehow or other,

02:28:52.840 --> 02:29:01.840
at least once. Next year or this year you have to. But I can't even promise next year,

02:29:01.840 --> 02:29:07.840
I really tell you. I must say that ninety percent next year you'll have the program

02:29:07.840 --> 02:29:14.840
again, because it's becoming very difficult, very difficult money wise also and otherwise

02:29:14.840 --> 02:29:20.840
it's becoming sun-wielding. So I would request you to think it over and those who want to

02:29:20.840 --> 02:29:25.840
come should give your names. Even if you have not paid the money you can do it because I

02:29:25.840 --> 02:29:30.840
am here for this month. So those who have not yet given your names also can give your

02:29:30.840 --> 02:29:41.840
names to come in and we'll adjust it. But I cannot make it, I mean I wanted to make

02:29:41.840 --> 02:29:45.840
it much cheaper for you, but it's not the food that is expensive, it's the travelling,

02:29:45.840 --> 02:29:58.840
but now travelling has become much cheaper. But everything is by the way, that's the

02:29:58.840 --> 02:30:07.840
trouble is, by the way. You see, if you want to save money and people will save money to

02:30:07.840 --> 02:30:12.840
buy Rolls Royce, which cost I don't know how much, for that horrible fellow in one

02:30:12.840 --> 02:30:23.840
year and such a wish can't have money to go to India. I believe it. At least once everybody

02:30:23.840 --> 02:30:38.840
should go watch it, because it helps, helps them such a lot. I myself never knew that

02:30:38.840 --> 02:30:47.840
it would help so much, but I never believe it does help. So those who have not yet given

02:30:47.840 --> 02:30:54.840
money also can give their names to come in or to their leaders.

02:30:54.840 --> 02:31:03.840
We'll be saving, staying for seven days on the seashore and beautiful, one of the best

02:31:03.840 --> 02:31:11.840
in the whole world. Vaisniv Ganesh has there and the water of the sea comes out of his

02:31:11.840 --> 02:31:18.840
nabhi and only his lower body you can see. The head is the mountain itself. You can see

02:31:18.840 --> 02:31:27.840
the lights coming out of it, only the Sahaja Yogis can see. I don't know about next year

02:31:27.840 --> 02:31:40.840
also, but it should not be a thing that is a sort of a by the way, that's important.

02:31:40.840 --> 02:31:49.840
So let us see what's happening, because Australians are quite a lot coming and we

02:31:49.840 --> 02:32:00.775
have to see about others also. All right? May God bless you.

02:32:09.035 --> 02:32:25.840
Now look at the music they have produced, the quality. Try to compete with them.

02:32:57.863 --> 02:33:08.840
Just think of it. He got his realization only last year. Last year this fellow got

02:33:08.840 --> 02:33:26.840
his realization in one year. We have made copies of that music for you people to be

02:33:26.840 --> 02:33:54.840
given you as presents only to the leaders.

04:04:44.840 --> 04:04:58.840
Everybody, please, because, and I would request all the people who came here for the first time to kindly now proceed because the program is finished.

04:04:58.840 --> 04:05:09.840
And if they so wish, they may leave the name and addresses in such way that we can contact them to tell them when there is a program.

04:05:09.840 --> 04:05:25.840
And there are meetings every Friday, and John was here, we'll talk to you outside. Please, John, could you go outside? So I would request all the new people now to leave this hall and all the sahaja yogis please come back in.

04:05:25.840 --> 04:05:33.840
Marilyn, everybody come back in.

04:05:33.840 --> 04:05:45.840
So again, people who are here for the first time are kindly requested to now leave the hall.

04:05:46.840 --> 04:06:06.840
Please sahaja yogi, can you just sit quietly in meditation?

04:06:06.840 --> 04:06:08.840
John, where is John?
