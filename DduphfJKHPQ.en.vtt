00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:09.400
[Speeker] If any one of you wants to put any question and get some ideas clarified,

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.160
Mataji is prepared to reply.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.920
Question: Shri Mataji, please tell me...the mantra...that should... [inaudible].

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.040
Shri Mataji: You shouldn't. First, your attention, your attention must be free.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:29.740
At the time of your realization, when the Kundalini is awakened, all your attention is extracted within

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:34.480
and the Kundalini while rising takes it on his head,or on her head,

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.320
and brings the attention outside the Sahasrara.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.880
So, at that time, best thing is to let loose yourself. Just sit down, watch it, what is happening,

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.100
instead of putting any effort.

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.780
It is an effortless, that helps you the best. So, no mantra is to be chanted.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:56.500
After realization you must know what mantra is to be chanted where. There is a big science about it.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:01.300
So, the complete tantra, what you call ‘Kundalini’ is there

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.840
but you must know how to handle it, what mantra is to be said, what is to be said

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:11.720
and which chakra lacks a thing and it is that you have to master it.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.800
And there are many here in Delhi also who have mastered it. So, it is not difficult. Anybody can master it.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.320
It is not difficult. Even a little girl like Pradnya has mastered the Kundalini.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.020
She can do it so why not you people can do it.

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:30.600
So, you have to just find out what are the chakras which are defective and you can treat it also.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.140
Just now those who are not Realized, you’ll get your realization no doubt so you would go

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.860
and meet those people at D288, Pandara Road,

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.420
and there you go and they will guide you as to what is to done in future.

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.500
And go deep into it and make yourself established and be a master of Kundalini.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:55.500
All that is guhya guhya taram, I have told them. And you will get all the knowledge about it.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:06.800
Seeker: [Inaudible].

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:12.880
Shri Mataji: That’s a very good question. He asks why universal consciousness,

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:21.100
it is all deliberate, why it is kept sleeping in the human being?

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:28.100
Now in the growth of evolution, from a small amoeba, you come to a human stage.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.620
At the human stage, articulation takes place.

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:39.400
Means like a shell of the egg is developed. For the egg to develop, the shell is developed.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:45.080
You are made limited. Through the growth of your ego and superego within yourself,

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:50.460
your Brahmarandhra is closed down, your “talu” is closed down, and you are left to yourself.

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:57.440
I’ll tell you an analogy by which you will understand. For e.g., if I have to use this mic,

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:04.460
first of all it is developed somewhere, away from the mains, then it is brought and put to the mains.

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:08.320
In the same way human being is cut from the mains.

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:14.160
He is given “I-ness” from him to develop his instrument, his awareness;

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.360
in such a manner that when he receives the mains, he can communicate it, he could understand it,

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.740
and for that development, articulation was done.

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:32.520
Just like an egg is made in a shell for protection and for its growth and then when the chick is ready

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:40.500
in that shell, it is broken by the mother; here just like I break your Brahmarandhra, is the same, it’s that.

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:48.240
Seeker: What is the idea of Atmadhyan?

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:54.520
Shri Mataji: Now the idea of Atmadhyan, if it is read in the books, it is rather difficult to make you understand.

00:03:54.520 --> 00:04:02.040
But what happens with the rise of Kundalini? First of all, you enter into that infinite thing,

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:09.220
the people, some people rise like steep, we can say a very strong

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.600
jet like speed they get.

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:17.000
But some of them rise very slowly and then we can see the stages into which they rise.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.940
The first thing that happens is that you become thoughtless. But you are aware.

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.520
First stage that happens is thoughtless awareness.

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.360
Thoughtless awareness means that you start watching the thoughts.

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.460
That means you are separated from yourself.

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:40.280
Like you were in water and now you jumped on to the boat and you see the water now

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.980
so that you are separated. This is what happens, those who have gradual ascent.

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:50.520
You become thoughtlessly aware, which we call in the Hatha Yoga as asampragnyat samadhi.

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:54.580
Of course, according to them it’s a very higher stage. But you become thoughtlessly aware

00:04:54.580 --> 00:05:00.800
and the vibrations start flowing from your hand by which you know that something is flowing.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:07.040
You start getting cool breeze from me and you start getting cool breeze from other Sahaja Yogis and when you give it to others

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.020
you find it is flowing.

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:13.600
This we can say is the first thing that happens. That means you

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:17.680
become collectively conscious of another personality. This is the first thing that happens.

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.360
The second stage into which, do you jump is Nirvikalpa,

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.100
means in that stage you become doubtless.

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.920
Then you don’t ask me questions. There are some people

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:32.680
who are like that here. So, they have no questions, they have felt it, they have known it. I say it in a different way

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.620
that supposing I give you a thousand rupees.

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:38.680
Now if you do not spend it how will you know what is the value of that?

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.460
You will say, “What you have given, thousand? What is there you have given? Just give us vibrations.”

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:46.720
But once you start using it, then you will see tremendous powers you have got.

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:52.340
And the powers of this so called, I mean what you call just ordinary vibrations,

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:55.180
some people think like that, it is so easily available,

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:59.700
it happens to you so sahaja, that you do not understand the value of it.

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:03.960
But once you start using them and then you see the tremendous thing that you have got it.

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:12.400
It gives the bliss and the joy that flows into you. You come into the stage of doubtless awareness.

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:20.720
The third one I would say, when the complete Self-realization is established. Now, in the thoughtless awareness,

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:25.320
as you can say that now, supposing now as you have got Justice sitting here, so then he is a Justice,

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:26.940
he has certain powers.

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:31.740
In the same way when you rise to the doubtless, thoughtless awareness you have certain powers

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:34.160
by which you can give awakening to people.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:40.200
Just move hand and the Kundalini of the people will move. It surprises, but it does.

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:44.260
You can move the hand and you can feel the Kundalini, you can feel the Kundalini of other persons,

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:48.700
you can feel the chakras of another person. It happens; only with thoughtless awareness.

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:52.220
But with doubtless awareness you start giving them realization.

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:57.220
Absolutely, you can just like that. And with higher Self-realization what happens?

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:01.080
That you just become a sakshi [witness]. No problem. You never catch anything.

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:06.360
You see, normally what happens when a person come to you, you place your hand for that person and you feel it,

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:09.300
“Oh! disgusting, this fellow is burning.”

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:13.200
You don’t like it because you see the chakras of that person are burning your fingers.

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:14.820
And you know it’s burning.

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:20.300
Then sometimes you catch also, you get involved into it. But later on, when you are completely self-realized

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:24.660
you become a Nirlepa. You do not catch any such things and

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:31.640
you rise into the realm where you are into complete vairag, you are just flowing, you are into sakshi state.

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:36.080
But after these three stages, is the stage of God’s realization

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:39.380
in which you start controlling the nature completely.

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:42.840
Some people, of course, through Hatha Yoga, they try to control certain nature,

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:44.700
but that is just upside down.

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:49.040
We start it from top and go down. First of all, let us go to the divine stage

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:53.320
and then come down. Then establish into the…, we control the natüre.

00:07:53.320 --> 00:08:01.420
See if you can control the say rain, you can control the sun. All this can be done.

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:06.020
But that is you see you lose interest in those thing. But automatically you can do it.

00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:10.640
For example, when I was going to see one maharaj like that who is a very evolved soul

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:14.540
and he has got it through you see thousands of years of tapasya.

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:23.780
Say he was sitting down there and he was pouring rain, the rain was pouring down and he didn’t want me to get drenched and so he was trying to control rain.

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:29.000
I know he can control rain. But the rain was pouring. And he didn’t know what to do and was so disgusted with himself.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.220
When I went up, he said, “Did you want to kill my ego that you didn’t allow the rain to stop?”

00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:36.640
I said, “No, it was not so. You see, I am a mother.” So, I told him very sweetly that,

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:41.500
“I know that you have bought a saree for me and if I was not drenched, you will not give me the saree.

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:45.540
So, I just wanted the rain to.” And that’s how you see, the little ego that was there

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:47.460
that, “I am controlling the rain”

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:55.060
dropped off, so it is the thing that happens automatically. You do not want to do it but it just happens.

00:08:55.080 --> 00:09:00.320
You just don’t want to bother about these things but it happens. Wherever you are it just happens.

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:04.380
That is that state where you start rising into God’s realization.

00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:09.060
When you are in God’s realization, whether you are sitting here or anywhere you can see things,

00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:12.400
you can influence people, you can help them.

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:17.680
You can do lot of things sitting down anywhere. You may sit in Himalayas.

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:23.980
There are people like that who are sitting in the Himalayas and are helping you. So, they can do it and they are one.

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:29.760
For example, this gentleman about whom I am telling you, who is a very great saint, he saw at my time, at the time of my birth,

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:31.020
everything that happened.

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:35.060
He knows about my past lives for thousands of years. He recognizes me much better.

00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:38.900
There is another one who came to see Me from Amarnath who is three hundred years old.

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:43.340
He is also of the same type and he also said all those things.

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:49.580
But you see, their style is different and your style is different. You are people are like Ganesha, they are not.

00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:53.120
They still catch. You don’t know. That’s why that three-hundred-year old man,

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:57.140
had some catches on his body. I said, “What have you done Nagnath Baba? How you got it?”

00:09:57.140 --> 00:10:00.360
He said, “I got it from one man, horrible fellow he touched me.”

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:04.800
I said, “You got it, alright. I will take it out for you.” Then he said, “What about you?”

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:08.880
I said, “Not me. I do not get it, I am a mother. A mother does not get it. Mother never catches because of children.”

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:13.720
In the same way you people also don’t catch. There are some people here who have cured cancer.

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:18.280
They have never caught anything from anybody. So, you see, you have much more power

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:21.140
because you are people who are simple,

00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:25.840
who are like Shri Ganesha. Because Shri Ganesha has much more power

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:27.680
than any one of the Deities there are.

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:33.500
Because He is so simple, He’s so dedicated to the Mother.

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:38.840
Seeker: [Inaudible]./(What is the aim of human life…… inaudible)

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:45.080
Shri Mataji: We are living in this world because we have to become the instrument in the hands of God.

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:47.120
He wants to use us.

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:50.940
You see we have to be a good instrument into his hand.

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:54.700
For example, an artist has a brush. Why is the brush there?

00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:59.640
For the artist to use the brush. Now, I will tell you a very sweet story about it.

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:03.200
Once Radhaji was very jealous of the murli,

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:05.960
that Shri Krishna was carrying on his lips.

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:16.400
So, she asked “What is your speciality…” She asked the murli, “What is your specialty that you are all the time near the lips of my lord?”

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:22.740
So, she said that, “My specialty is that I am no special. I have become a hollow person.

00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:27.400
The melody is going through me. He is using me just as an instrument

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:32.700
and I laugh at the people when they say that, ‘You have been played.’

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:37.800
I say, ‘I am just watching like a sakshi, like a witness. And if I stand anywhere in between

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:40.680
then his melody will be spoilt’.”

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:47.700
This is the purpose and if you don’t achieve this purpose then all this recklessness comes in, these problems comes in,

00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:52.580
which we can say in a gross way, then your parasympathetic is taxed.

00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:56.840
When your parasympathetic is taxed, then you start thinking, “What are we to do?

00:11:56.840 --> 00:12:03.300
Where are we to jump now?” This whole petrol is being exhausted in this body.

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:09.480
But, once you open out to the mains, it starts pouring into you. And you are absolutely relaxed.

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:13.240
Seeker: [Inaudible].

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:16.960
Shri Mataji: It just takes a second if you are ready.

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:20.400
For every ordinary person it really takes a second.

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:24.040
Then it rises, it takes a second to rise. But what happens,

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:26.140
that Kundalini is your Mother.

00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:30.840
So now, supposing your mother is coming to see you and you are sick.

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:35.120
So, first of all, what she will do is to see that your sickness is removed.

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:39.080
Then she sees that you are mentally upset. So, she looks after your mental problems.

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:45.080
Then she sees that you are wrongly placed spiritually. So, she corrects you. And ultimately, she blesses you.

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:49.620
So, if somebody is in temperance, empathy, who has got a good health,

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:54.000
of normal health, he is living a normal married life, he is the best suited.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.780
And there are some who have got it like just that. But some people are rather sick, they have some trouble

00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:03.380
because they have gone through various ordeals of life.

00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:08.460
They have been troubled, even tortured, they have got some mental problem. The Mother has to soothe them.

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:13.460
So if there is, you see, you cannot say that, when this seed is going to sprout, it will sprout.

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:20.400
Can you say that, at this day, the flowers will appear? Can you say that, at this day, all fruits will be coming? No, you cannot!

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:23.620
There is no time for living things. It works itself.

00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:26.960
It is a living process so it works itself.

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:33.540
It works for the organism, that is yourself, and then it clicks itself.

00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:36.040
That is what is sahaja.

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:45.480
Seeker: [Inaudible, asking for Realization].

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:51.120
Shri Mataji: Realization? Yeah! Why not, why not? I am here only for that. (Hindi.)

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:57.860
(Shri Mataji is speaking in Hindi)

00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:11.700
Question: Shri Mataji, please tell me... such suffering... overpopulation...

00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:39.840
Seeker: [Inaudible].

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:44.140
Shri Mataji: Right, for anybody who is not realized that should be the question,

00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:48.380
that you see, around such a lot of miseries. Now he has asked two questions.

00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:50.520
You see, he has confused two questions.

00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:57.420
The first one of misery, the second one about over population. So first, I will answer the first question of misery.

00:14:57.420 --> 00:15:01.760
Now you say that there are miseries. I accept it that there are miseries

00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:07.740
and miseries are there because of human beings themselves. Because they haven’t got the divine within themselves.

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:12.020
If they have divine, they will not dominate, they will not bear domination,

00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:13.360
they will be different people.

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:18.940
But we can say one thing, how will reduce the miseries of people when you get Realized?

00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:26.040
See, I have told you that there are seven chakras in the human beings. When they are awakened what happens? Let us see.

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:32.180
First of all, your physical problems are solved, your health improves,

00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:35.120
you lead a very healthy life.

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:42.180
You will be amazed and in Sahaja Yoga, nobody dies before he is 70 years of age.

00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:46.320
He leads a very, very healthy life to begin with.

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:49.520
First misery of physical life is over.

00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:55.380
Not only that he lives a physically good life, but he makes others physically alright.

00:15:55.380 --> 00:16:01.440
He makes them physically fit without taking a single pai [paisa/rupees] from them.

00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:07.080
The vibrations that flow from him, he cures them and the other person gets all right.

00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:11.880
Now as I have told you that there are people here who have treated

00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:15.700
so many people, have cured so many people without taking a single pai,

00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:20.800
because this love is flowing and that’s yourselves! So, the physical problem is solved.

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:26.660
Then the second problem is your emotional problem. The person suffers emotionally.

00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:33.960
They become emotionally disturbed, sometimes there are possessions.

00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:37.580
They come into it from their subconscious mind and there are problems from the emotional side.

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:42.260
Now, after Realization, people become sakshi in the sense

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:49.980
that emotionally they do not get involved into the things, that they do not feel disturbed about it but they see the things.

00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:56.200
I will give you a very concrete example. I had a grandchild, first grandchild

00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:58.260
born in my family.

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:03.380
This child was born with a heart which was all time, permanently,

00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:08.520
there was a clotage which cannot be cured. Because it’s a basic problem

00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:12.360
and I knew about it the day she was born.

00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:21.780
But I was silent and on the 5th day I said to the doctor that, “You must take her under the x-ray and see what is the thing.”

00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:24.000
Doctor was surprised. He said, “Why do you think so?

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.160
Such a little child should not be exposed to x-ray.”

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:34.980
I said, “You take her.” I took her secretly and showed her to the doctor. They found that, the enlargement of the heart.

00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:40.140
Now, when I came home, I didn’t tell my daughter, I didn’t tell my husband who was to come from Delhi.

00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:46.040
When he came back, with very great introduction I told him. Immediately he fainted.

00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:51.620
He is a very healthy man and, I mean that way emotionally he is supposed to be a very sensitive person,

00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:56.160
very balanced, but he fainted. We told this to the father of the child,

00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:59.600
he fainted. My daughter fainted. They couldn’t bear it.

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:03.400
I took the child to the hospital. I admitted her in the hospital because the doctor said

00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:05.540
they had to do other tests.

00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:09.640
Then we had to take the child to America and I knew that the child was going to die.

00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:14.260
But I said “alright”. If they think, the child has to be taken, I took. None of them could take.

00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:18.500
They couldn’t take the child. I took there.

00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:22.880
The so-called miserable people actually are overdoing things.

00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:26.980
By which they are spoiling every body’s life and making themselves miserable also.

00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:30.860
The ways we talk of our misery actually are so exaggerating.

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:36.600
I do not know if they are really that miserable the way they talk about. And they cannot do anything about it

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:41.940
because unless and until you are separated from the problem, how are you going to solve it?

00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:46.780
You see, you have to be separated. Unless and until you are a doctor, you are not going to operate.

00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:50.220
Supposing you are the patient, how are you going to operate yourself?

00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:55.460
So, the doctor in you must be separated. This is what the Sahaja Yoga does.

00:18:55.460 --> 00:19:00.260
Because you are the patient and you are the doctor that’s why the whole thing is more exaggerated.

00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:05.040
If you find any doctor being sick, he’ll be the worst patient.

00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:11.420
I have seen that in practice it is so. That’s why those who are miserable are much more miserable than they are really

00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:17.040
because they themselves do not know how to cure it. So, the emotional problem is solved, like this.

00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:21.360
Now, then there is another problem which we face all the time

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:23.820
is of our dharma, of our dignity.

00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:31.060
How to be dignified, how to be ourselves? The spiritual problem, and that is solved. No doubt.

00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:34.500
Because then you find the divine flowing through you.

00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:37.160
You really become a dynamic personality

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:44.300
apart from that, for this worldly things I have to tell you another thing which happened to people who are Sahaja Yogis.

00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:49.920
That is, your Laxmi is awaken. Now you know what is Laxmi.

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:53.000
Such a person cannot become a beggar. Cannot!

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.320
A Sahaja Yogi cannot become a beggar because his Laxmi is awakened.

00:19:56.320 --> 00:20:01.320
He is looked after. See, there is God Almighty who’s looking after you!

00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:06.200
This is the sin against God that all the time you are so unsecured.

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:10.800
The One who has created you, the One who is looking after you is going to look after you everywhere.

00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:13.700
But you want to run after other things. You want to do smuggling,

00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:17.340
you want to do all kind of things, you want to cut each other’s throat

00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:22.940
and then you want to see that you are happy, you cannot. You have to depend on Him and on His grace.

00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:28.640
And the person who is realized, he is like a badshah, he is the king.

00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:33.480
He is always the king. He doesn’t bother. I can tell you about myself.

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:37.260
I never feel I have dearth of money or dearth of anything. Never!

00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:40.100
You see if you ask me, I can sleep on the ground.

00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:44.460
Perhaps I was born in very rich family and my husband is quiet rich,

00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:49.180
but if you ask me, I can live anywhere. I can do without food for days together.

00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:54.060
It doesn’t matter of all the time people talk about eating, eating. How much do you eat?

00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:58.080
There is no need to eat such a lot. That’s why some people are poor.

00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:01.380
Some people eat such a lot that there are some people who are poor.

00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:05.000
But automatically your attention fromfood and all drops out.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:09.580
You just get it. If you get it well and good, you don’t get it well and good.

00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:13.900
Sorry this morning I had no breakfast and all that. I didn’t know that I had no. And I had not even my lunch, I would not…

00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:16.400
Because this body is filled with energy you don’t need.

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:19.660
Actually, this is the first time the energy is filling you all.

00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:25.460
Then you give vibrations. In Rahuri, [Maharashtra state], there is one university there they have experimented.

00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:31.220
In the University,first time they have experimented in agriculture university, ith these vibrations.

00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:41.660
They have found that the growth of all this wheat was 10 ten times more. They found that the fruits that came out of it were beautiful

00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:45.180
and they were so tasty and so lusty.

00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:47.920
They found that when the cow was given vibrated water,

00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:53.200
Indian cow started giving milk like an Australian cow.

00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:58.640
But I cannot write a guarantee check for you. That is one thing.

00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:02.620
So, all the miseries so called will drop out.

00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:06.400
Now the overpopulation problem. That’s very interesting. I’ll tell you what it is.

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:09.220
Why there is such an overpopulation?

00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:17.700
You see the congenial atmosphere for the rakshasas and for the bhoots, giving chance for bhoots to come as human beings.

00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:24.360
Once this congenial atmosphere for them will disappear, only the saintly will come and they are not so many.

00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:37.640
And they will not need also so many things. A saintly person does not need much. With very little he is so satisfied, he doesn’t want. You see, he is a badshah.

00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:40.720
It’s only the mental attitude that makes us biharis.

00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:48.480
Otherwise, we are not. We are very rich people. What else?

00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:54.220
Seeker: [Inaudible].

00:22:54.220 --> 00:23:00.800
Shri Mataji: Now I would say that really some who are really hungry will ask for the ultimate

00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:04.380
but those who are not will be asking me questions. As I say

00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:08.780
I have cooked the food for you and those who are hungry will say, “Mother give us. Now it’s too much.

00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:12.540
Now these people are just wasting our time. We are very hungry.” And that’s the stuff.

00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:22.260
And that’s the thing you should ask for. That’s the real thing you should ask for and you should get it.
