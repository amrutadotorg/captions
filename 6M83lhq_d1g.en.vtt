00:03.050 --> 00:11.030
[Voice off]: Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi, the
most important spiritual figure in the world

00:11.030 --> 00:12.080
today.

00:12.080 --> 00:37.120
Please join us on a special program of “Audrey
Hope’s real women”

00:37.120 --> 00:42.980
Interviewer: My name is Audrey Hopes and welcome
to ‘Real women”.

00:43.074 --> 00:48.544
It is a great honour to be in the presence
of the most important spiritual figure in

00:48.544 --> 00:52.103
the world today, Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi.

00:52.103 --> 00:58.164
Shri Mataji is a world leader and has travelled
the globe many times over to give Self Realization

00:58.164 --> 01:00.063
to thousands.

01:00.063 --> 01:05.714
Self Realization is the pure connexion with
our spiritual nature and is the only hope

01:05.714 --> 01:08.464
for a stable society.

01:08.464 --> 01:12.644
Today is that day prophesized by the saints.

01:12.644 --> 01:16.434
Once you may have needed to travel to the
Himalayas or to meditate on a mountain for

01:16.434 --> 01:21.904
twenty years, but now, through the grace of
Shri Mataji, there is a simple way to achieve

01:21.904 --> 01:25.554
that connexion and that is through Sahaja
Yoga.

01:25.554 --> 01:31.784
Shri Mataji founded Sahaja Yoga as a method
for human beings to experience the truth within

01:31.784 --> 01:33.364
and to become your own master.

01:33.364 --> 01:38.914
Shri Mataji is a mother and a grandmother,
a true role model for all human beings.

01:38.914 --> 01:42.984
Shri Mataji was a spiritual guide for Mahatma
Gandhi.

01:42.984 --> 01:49.844
She accepts no money for Realization and she
says the truth cannot be paid for.

01:49.844 --> 01:55.154
She joins us after her fourth visit to the
United Nations and before her journey to Washington

01:55.154 --> 01:56.174
DC.

01:56.174 --> 01:59.134
Shri Mataji is known all over the world.

01:59.134 --> 02:01.234
She is less known in the United States.

02:01.234 --> 02:07.264
Well, it is here, in the mist of media and
its power, where she is needed the most.

02:07.264 --> 02:10.444
Shri Mataji, we are deeply honoured to have
you here, thank you.

02:10.444 --> 02:12.384
Shri Mataji: Thank you very much.

02:12.384 --> 02:18.694
Interviewer: I’d like to begin by speaking
about Self Realization and to tell the viewers

02:18.694 --> 02:20.804
what Self Realization is.

02:20.804 --> 02:30.834
Shri Mataji: Within yourself lies a power
which is called in Sanskrit language as Kundalini,

02:30.834 --> 02:33.274
which is in the sacrum bone.

02:33.274 --> 02:41.843
That means definitely, that the Greeks knew
this was a sacred bone where that power was

02:41.843 --> 02:42.843
lying.

02:42.843 --> 02:49.134
This is the power which connects you to the
All-pervading Power.

02:49.134 --> 02:57.134
Now the truth is that we are not this body,
this mind, this ego, these conditionings.

02:57.134 --> 03:05.504
But you are the pure Spirit because you say:
“My ego, my body”, you are the pure Spirit,

03:05.504 --> 03:07.494
this is one truth about yourself.

03:07.494 --> 03:13.364
Another truth is that there is the All-pervading
Power of divine love.

03:13.364 --> 03:16.124
It’s called by various names.

03:16.124 --> 03:20.093
You see these beautiful flowers; it’s a
miracle itself.

03:20.093 --> 03:21.954
And who runs our heart?

03:21.954 --> 03:27.154
We never inquire, we don’t find by doctors
will tell you it’s the autonomous nervous

03:27.154 --> 03:28.154
system.

03:28.154 --> 03:29.164
But who is this “auto”?

03:29.164 --> 03:37.924
So these two things we have to realize that
we are the pure Spirit and there is an All-pervading

03:37.924 --> 03:40.404
Power of divine love.

03:40.404 --> 03:43.234
Power of love, not of hatred.

03:43.234 --> 03:45.964
Interviewer: How does one receive Self Realization?

03:45.964 --> 03:52.464
Does a person have to give up their personal
life or self problems before they can attain

03:52.464 --> 03:53.464
this?

03:53.464 --> 03:58.144
Shri Mataji: It’s very simple, that within
our being, a complete machinery is already

03:58.144 --> 04:00.804
made through our evolutionary process.

04:00.804 --> 04:10.374
And we have seven centres, main seven centres
placed on our central nervous system, or we

04:10.374 --> 04:20.604
can call it on the parasympathetic and ultimately,
this power raises, penetrates through these

04:20.604 --> 04:29.723
six centres only, ultimately, pierces through
the fontanel bone area and connects you to

04:29.723 --> 04:32.023
that All-pervading Power.

04:32.023 --> 04:39.854
While it is travelling through these charkas
or the centres or the energy centres we can

04:39.854 --> 04:43.104
call them, it nourishes them.

04:43.104 --> 04:49.234
Not only it nourishes, it integrates them
and it enlightens them.

04:49.234 --> 04:53.813
Most of the problems, global problems, are
because of human beings.

04:53.813 --> 04:58.063
And most of the human problems are because
of these centres.

04:58.063 --> 05:04.644
Because these centres cater to our physical,
mental, emotional and spiritual needs.

05:04.644 --> 05:12.223
So once these centres are out of gear, we
have all these problems whether on an individual

05:12.223 --> 05:14.773
basis or on a collective basis.

05:14.773 --> 05:26.174
So when this connects to the All-pervading
Power, then you achieve a new state of awareness.

05:26.174 --> 05:29.054
So there’s a breakthrough in your evolution.

05:29.054 --> 05:31.223
Evolution process is spontaneous.

05:31.223 --> 05:35.413
We have not paid for it, we didn’t do anything,
we are becoming human beings.

05:35.413 --> 05:38.723
So now, the last one, why should we pay for
it?

05:38.723 --> 05:41.033
Or why should we do anything about it?

05:41.033 --> 05:46.934
Interviewer: Does one need blind faith or
can this be approached as you say, or how

05:46.934 --> 05:48.454
is it approached like a science?

05:48.454 --> 05:50.484
Shri Mataji: It’s just a living process.

05:50.484 --> 05:56.234
You try to understand this way, that this
Mother earth is there.

05:56.234 --> 06:00.283
What we have to do is to put one seed in it
and the seed sprouts.

06:00.283 --> 06:01.283
How?

06:01.283 --> 06:06.704
Because it is built in, in the seed to sprout
and built in, in the Mother Earth to make

06:06.704 --> 06:07.704
it sprout.

06:07.704 --> 06:09.674
It’s as simple as that.

06:09.674 --> 06:13.623
Interviewer: We Americans are very into scientific
proof.

06:13.623 --> 06:18.653
[Laughter]
And you describe Sahaja Yoga as an essence

06:18.653 --> 06:23.434
of all religions and not just a religion.

06:23.434 --> 06:24.713
How is Sahaja Yoga different?

06:24.713 --> 06:26.364
Shri Mataji: “Saha” means “with”.

06:26.364 --> 06:28.384
“Ja” means born.

06:28.384 --> 06:34.734
Born with you is the right to have this union,
the Yoga.

06:34.734 --> 06:37.343
That is Sahaja Yoga.

06:37.343 --> 06:48.113
By this union, you realize that all the religions
were flowers born on one tree of spirituality.

06:48.113 --> 06:52.623
But we have plucked the flowers and now we
are fighting with the dead flowers.

06:52.623 --> 07:02.623
If there is one God then why could we-how
could we fight in the name of God?

07:02.623 --> 07:04.884
This is the philosophy of Gandhiji also.

07:04.884 --> 07:14.074
We also followed the same philosophy not only
but, as we worship all the incarnations and

07:14.074 --> 07:19.753
all the prophets and all messiahs, in the
same way, he said we have to worship them.

07:19.753 --> 07:24.843
It’s not just to show respect but you must
worship the same way.

07:24.843 --> 07:33.503
That is Sahaj religion which encompasses all
the religions and also respects because in

07:33.503 --> 07:35.964
essence all of them are the same.

07:35.964 --> 07:42.454
And if there is one singular message in all
these religions is that: “Seek your Self

07:42.454 --> 07:44.134
to be born again”.

07:44.134 --> 07:46.833
That’s the message in all the religions.

07:46.833 --> 07:53.423
Interviewer: So where has the religion gone
wrong?

07:53.423 --> 07:58.753
We are- let’s take Christianity for example.

07:58.753 --> 08:06.953
Shri Mataji: Christianity has gone wrong at
a very early stage I should say, where it

08:06.953 --> 08:10.403
was taken over by Paul.

08:10.403 --> 08:16.014
I asked my father when I first saw his name
in the Bible, I said: “Who is this Mister

08:16.014 --> 08:17.014
Paul?”

08:17.014 --> 08:18.963
He said: “He is a squatter.

08:18.963 --> 08:21.014
He had nothing to do with Christ.

08:21.014 --> 08:23.423
He never met Christ.

08:23.423 --> 08:28.333
He had actually killed so many Christians,
he has killed the disciple of Christ called

08:28.333 --> 08:29.333
Steven.

08:29.333 --> 08:36.863
But being a bureaucrat, he thought it was
a good platform to jump onto the platform

08:36.863 --> 08:38.454
of Christianity.

08:38.454 --> 08:41.803
And he had to have help from somebody, one
of the disciples.

08:41.803 --> 08:47.843
The worse disciple of Christ was Peter, so
he grabbed Peter and has written the Bible”.

08:47.843 --> 08:55.814
Despite all the things they have done, that
Christ told Peter that “Satan will catch

08:55.814 --> 09:00.024
hold of you’ it’s clearly said.

09:00.024 --> 09:05.803
Now this Mister Peter and Mister Paul put
together tried to spoil all the great work

09:05.803 --> 09:13.874
of our Lord Jesus-Christ because, first of
all, the worst for women.

09:13.874 --> 09:17.604
Paul hated women from his heart.

09:17.604 --> 09:22.254
And that’s why even for Christ’s Mother,
he uses a word like “woman”.

09:22.254 --> 09:24.053
To us, she is a Goddess.

09:24.053 --> 09:26.524
She is a Mahalakshmi, to Sahaja Yogis.

09:26.524 --> 09:28.814
But to him, she was just a woman.

09:28.814 --> 09:36.464
And the way he has conducted the whole thing
has brought such a disaster on the women of

09:36.464 --> 09:39.354
the West.

09:39.354 --> 09:46.074
Even now, up till now, women are treated as
something very low for spirituality.

09:46.074 --> 09:50.694
But in India, a woman is the shakti, is the
power.

09:50.694 --> 09:56.814
Another great mistake they have committed
is in describing the Trinity.

09:56.814 --> 10:08.284
We have God the father, God the son and the
third one is a Holy Ghost, is a dove.

10:08.284 --> 10:13.403
How can you have a father and a son and no
mother?

10:13.403 --> 10:21.454
But there is a Primordial Mother which was
accepted by all the religions even the Jews

10:21.454 --> 10:23.614
had it.

10:23.614 --> 10:25.954
Greeks called it Athena.

10:25.954 --> 10:28.874
“Atha” in Sanskrit means “primordial”.

10:28.874 --> 10:29.874
Athena.

10:29.874 --> 10:31.154
In India, this is called as Adi Shakti.

10:31.154 --> 10:38.404
In every religion, they had this Mother who
was the Primordial Mother.

10:38.404 --> 10:47.764
So he cancelled all the powers of a mother
and that is how the women have a very inferiority

10:47.764 --> 10:51.684
complex, I think, or insecurity in the Western
world.

10:51.684 --> 10:59.793
Because they think we have to, all the time,
be apologetical [unsure] and we should always

10:59.793 --> 11:05.483
serve the men and we should sell our body,
we should make ourselves very attractive,

11:05.483 --> 11:07.784
otherwise, we have no place!

11:07.784 --> 11:11.843
And that is how the morality of women is shattered.

11:11.843 --> 11:15.504
Interviewer: I wanted to use a quote from
that [pensée?

11:15.504 --> 11:19.214
French word?] in “Timothy 1” to really
emphasise this point.

11:19.214 --> 11:22.644
It says in the Bible, “A woman should learn
in quietness and full submission.

11:22.644 --> 11:28.814
I do not present a woman to teach or to have
authority over a man; she must be silent.

11:28.814 --> 11:30.914
For Adam was formed first, then Eve.

11:30.914 --> 11:35.043
And Adam was not the one deceived; it was
the woman who was deceived and became a sinner.

11:35.043 --> 11:36.043
[The New Testament, 1 Timothy 2:9-14]

11:36.043 --> 11:39.214
Shri Mataji: That’s also a mistake about
Adam and Eve also.

11:39.214 --> 11:40.983
But that, I’ll deal later on.

11:40.983 --> 11:48.543
But a simple thing is that it was a complete
attack on womanhood.

11:48.543 --> 11:53.963
And that’s how women have accepted- imagine
such a developed country like England, was

11:53.963 --> 11:58.074
discussing till yesterday, whether a woman
should preach or not.

11:58.074 --> 11:59.074
Yes!

11:59.074 --> 12:04.444
I mean, now, with great difficulty, some people
have agreed that women should preach.

12:04.444 --> 12:05.754
I just don’t understand.

12:05.754 --> 12:08.684
In India, a woman is very powerful.

12:08.684 --> 12:12.324
She doesn’t care for her husband if he goes
after another woman.

12:12.324 --> 12:15.464
She says: “Alright, he’s sinful, let him
go to Hell.

12:15.464 --> 12:16.464
I don’t care."

12:16.464 --> 12:20.654
She stands on her own merit on her chastity.

12:20.654 --> 12:22.524
She doesn’t bother.

12:22.524 --> 12:30.684
Now, the whole situation is so bad, that women
have to be, all the time, trying to, you see,

12:30.684 --> 12:33.144
expose their body also.

12:33.144 --> 12:37.343
I haven’t seen a single film in which a
man is exposed.

12:37.343 --> 12:43.603
It’s always the women [who] must be exposed
as if men are some Sanctum sanctorum.

12:43.603 --> 12:49.514
I feel the slavery of women is much more in
the West than in India.

12:49.514 --> 12:53.804
Interviewer: And how about the Koran?

12:53.804 --> 12:55.423
I’m speaking about the Iranians.

12:55.423 --> 13:00.884
I know you did a programme this week and it
was a very important programme.

13:00.884 --> 13:06.093
And I’d like to talk about how the Iranian
people have misinterpreted Mohamed and the

13:06.093 --> 13:10.624
effects on their society and the importance
of their changing for women.

13:10.624 --> 13:11.624
[unsure]

13:11.624 --> 13:12.624
Shri Mataji: Yes.

13:12.624 --> 13:15.923
Even Muhammad Sahib, you see, he respected
women so much.

13:15.923 --> 13:17.644
You know, they used to have wars.

13:17.644 --> 13:18.644
They were tribes.

13:18.644 --> 13:19.923
They were tribal people.

13:19.923 --> 13:24.233
It was only Muhammad Sahib who could take
birth in those horrible Arabs.

13:24.233 --> 13:29.444
And he found that so many men, young men were
killed.

13:29.444 --> 13:30.713
So he said: “Alright.

13:30.713 --> 13:36.964
If there are not young men, let the old men
marry, even young girl.

13:36.964 --> 13:38.353
It doesn’t matter but marry.

13:38.353 --> 13:43.944
Even if they have to marry five times, marry
so that they do not become prostitutes.

13:43.944 --> 13:49.283
Just to respect their chastity he prescribed
this thing but it is not compulsory that you

13:49.283 --> 13:50.553
should marry five times.

13:50.553 --> 13:54.153
You see, we have horrible things in India.

13:54.153 --> 13:59.684
A man marries four times, has eight children
each time because they believe that but that

13:59.684 --> 14:01.874
democracy [demography?], they’ll be powerful.

14:01.874 --> 14:09.403
Then, after some time, they divorce their
wives by saying three times: “Talaq, talaq,

14:09.403 --> 14:10.403
talaq."

14:10.403 --> 14:11.403
[repudiation].

14:11.403 --> 14:15.194
Now, these women are with so many children,
are just left on the street.

14:15.194 --> 14:23.694
And if you see them you’ll think that this
is worse than Somalia.

14:23.694 --> 14:25.213
He respected women!

14:25.213 --> 14:30.963
Not only, he told his wife that: “You are
going to work out- Aicha” he told her: “You

14:30.963 --> 14:34.894
are going to work out something against the
religion."

14:34.894 --> 14:41.764
And really it was wrong on her because his
own daughter, as you know her name was Fatima,

14:41.764 --> 14:45.923
stood up and said that: “This, never Muhammad
Sahib has said it."

14:45.923 --> 14:53.704
But this Abu-Bakr is a fellow who just took
the platform, as it is, I should say, instead

14:53.704 --> 14:58.293
of his own son in law, Hazrat Ali, who was
a great Realized soul.

14:58.293 --> 15:07.773
And he just completely changed the ideas about
women which Fatima was going to tell.

15:07.773 --> 15:14.973
So there were big wars called Karbala in which
two children of Fatimabi were killed, Hazrat

15:14.973 --> 15:21.733
Ali was also killed and there two groups which
were formed, one is Shia and Sunni.

15:21.733 --> 15:28.403
But Shias also don’t understand that they
have to respect their women because Fatimabi

15:28.403 --> 15:32.134
herself was a, not only a saint but an incarnation.

15:32.134 --> 15:34.134
She was a Goddess.

15:34.134 --> 15:40.634
Interviewer: How has the media affected our
view of women today?

15:40.634 --> 15:48.194
Shri Mataji: In the Western media I must say
that women are used just to lure or some sort

15:48.194 --> 15:53.954
of a very low type of human beings I should
say.

15:53.954 --> 15:56.124
Men are not sex points.

15:56.124 --> 15:57.163
They are the Spirit.

15:57.163 --> 16:00.974
They are reduced to this sex point by Freud.

16:00.974 --> 16:06.254
And Freud was like a Christ here once upon
a time.

16:06.254 --> 16:11.333
Now of course, after so many years, I said
this at least twenty years back.

16:11.333 --> 16:17.754
But now it is appearing, many- I’ve seen
some books like “Fall of Freudian Empire”

16:17.754 --> 16:20.903
“Freudian Freud”, so many books are coming
now!

16:20.903 --> 16:22.944
Already all the harm has been done!

16:22.944 --> 16:29.624
Human beings are reduced to a sex point now
by media and women who are very cheap who

16:29.624 --> 16:38.194
can expose their body and can sell their chastity
are regarded as great heroines.

16:38.194 --> 16:39.194
This is what?

16:39.194 --> 16:40.863
It’s the situation of the media that is
today.

16:40.863 --> 16:45.064
Interviewer: I heard you have even said that
Freud can only prosper in America.

16:45.064 --> 16:46.173
Shri Mataji: Hum?

16:46.173 --> 16:47.803
Interviewer: Freud can only prosper in America.

16:47.803 --> 16:48.803
Shri Mataji: Yes.

16:48.803 --> 16:49.803
Interviewer: You said that.

16:49.803 --> 16:50.803
Shri Mataji: It’s a fact.

16:50.803 --> 16:55.894
He was born in Austria and when I talked against
Freud they all clapped.

16:55.894 --> 16:59.273
They were very happy I said so because they
were quite ashamed about him.

16:59.273 --> 17:07.834
But even in Austria, you find so many prostitutes
on the streets, standing all the while.

17:07.834 --> 17:11.863
But here, at least, there it is, the housewives
are housewives.

17:11.863 --> 17:16.764
Here, even housewife has to dress up in such
a way that she should be like a prostitute.

17:16.764 --> 17:19.034
Why should you do that?

17:19.034 --> 17:20.034
You must have your self-respect.

17:20.034 --> 17:26.144
Interviewer: How is this special time for
women?

17:26.144 --> 17:34.944
Shri Mataji: I call it this a Blossom time
because I say they are many flowers, so many

17:34.944 --> 17:42.364
some of them are on the Earth and they are
to become now fruits.

17:42.364 --> 17:49.854
But it’s called as Qiyamah in the Koran,
meaning the Resurrection time.

17:49.854 --> 17:56.584
Even in the Indian scriptures, we have this
Resurrection time and by many astrologers,

17:56.584 --> 18:02.954
thousands of years back, it was predicted
that such and such time will come.

18:02.954 --> 18:06.984
And also in the Bible, it is the Last Judgement.

18:06.984 --> 18:14.844
There’s another stupid idea which we find
in Bible and also in Koran, which is very

18:14.844 --> 18:20.114
stupid, and I think also- I don’t know about
the Torah, but they said that there is also

18:20.114 --> 18:26.184
the same idea previously – that, at the
time of Resurrection our dead bodies will

18:26.184 --> 18:29.304
come out of the graves and then they’ll
ascend.

18:29.304 --> 18:33.814
Now, tell Me what is left in the grave of
the dead bodies?

18:33.814 --> 18:37.554
It is so absurd, it’s so illogical.

18:37.554 --> 18:42.084
Actually, in that way, I would say Indian
scriptures said the correct thing that at

18:42.084 --> 18:48.644
this time of Kali Yuga all the souls which
are lost, all the souls who want their Realization,

18:48.644 --> 18:58.584
all the souls who have been thinking of God
and seeking God all over the world, will be

18:58.584 --> 18:59.584
reborn.

18:59.584 --> 19:02.564
That’s why we have a population problem.

19:02.564 --> 19:08.014
That is why all kinds of horrible people are
also born.

19:08.014 --> 19:11.614
In this time, about twenty years back, your
media was much better.

19:11.614 --> 19:14.904
They didn’t show such horrible scenes.

19:14.904 --> 19:18.634
I mean they must show bedroom’s scenes,
what is the need?

19:18.634 --> 19:19.694
Bathroom scenes.

19:19.694 --> 19:24.674
I mean, if somebody comes into your house,
do you take them to your bedroom, into your

19:24.674 --> 19:26.754
bathroom or you keep them in the dining room?

19:26.754 --> 19:29.334
I mean, it’s private life.

19:29.334 --> 19:31.654
They have no respect for privacy.

19:31.654 --> 19:39.074
Now, you see, this kind of funny idea that
we are going to get out of the graves and

19:39.074 --> 19:45.854
all that is still lingering in the mind of
many ignorant Christians and also Muslims.

19:45.854 --> 19:49.654
One Bosnia fellow met Me, he was Muslim.

19:49.654 --> 19:53.724
I asked him: “Why were you dying there,
what was the need to die?”

19:53.724 --> 19:57.674
He said: “Because if we die now in the name
of God, we’ll be resurrected."

19:57.674 --> 19:58.674
[Interviewer is laughing.]

19:58.674 --> 20:04.074
Shri Mataji: I mean it is relevant from the
idea of Bible, you see?

20:04.074 --> 20:11.024
So this is what it is that these ideas are
to be put right.

20:11.024 --> 20:15.984
In the west, you see, we have Christianity,
we have other religions.

20:15.984 --> 20:23.984
But, I would say that the roots of the spiritual
knowledge, it’s more in India.

20:23.984 --> 20:27.354
I’m myself born in a Christian religion.

20:27.354 --> 20:34.574
But the roots about it, the explanation about
it, is much better discovered in India because

20:34.574 --> 20:39.724
it’s an ancient country which has been all
the times seeking, seeking, for thousands

20:39.724 --> 20:43.424
of years.

20:43.424 --> 20:47.284
Now the system that is Sahaja Yoga as you
mentioned is not mine.

20:47.284 --> 20:49.824
It’s an ancient system.

20:49.824 --> 20:55.954
But we had this system in the Nath Panthis,
they call it, that they were in the centre.

20:55.954 --> 21:01.354
And one master will have only one disciple,
this was the tradition.

21:01.354 --> 21:06.564
So there were very few people who got their
Realization.

21:06.564 --> 21:12.534
Shri Rama’s father-in-law’s guru was Ashtavakra.

21:12.534 --> 21:13.974
He has written about sahaj.

21:13.974 --> 21:23.494
But he has just described what happens when
you get into the state of Spirit.

21:23.494 --> 21:29.194
This father-in-law, Janaka, gave Realization
to only one person Natchiketa according to

21:29.194 --> 21:30.194
the tradition.

21:30.194 --> 21:39.684
But, on the twelve century, there was a great
poet in India, in Maharashtra, born as Gnyaneshwara,

21:39.684 --> 21:44.524
who asked his guru, his own brother that:
“Let me also tell about this."

21:44.524 --> 21:46.844
He said: “All right”.

21:46.844 --> 21:48.434
He permitted.

21:48.434 --> 21:55.444
So in his Gnyaneshwari which is just the explanation
of Gita, he has clearly said in the sixth

21:55.444 --> 22:01.624
chapter about Kundalini, how she rises, how
she gives you Realization and everything.

22:01.624 --> 22:08.354
But those people who were in charge of religion,
as usual, didn’t know how to do it.

22:08.354 --> 22:13.854
So what they did, they said:” This is “nisidhat”
[forbid] – means, cancelled- you don’t

22:13.854 --> 22:15.144
read this sixth chapter."

22:15.144 --> 22:16.754
So nobody would read that chapter.

22:16.754 --> 22:21.184
That’s how it went into background!

22:21.184 --> 22:31.564
So I would say, after that, many great saints
like Guru Nanak, Kabir, Sukarama, Ramdas,

22:31.564 --> 22:38.544
in the sixteen century, did a great work of
Kundalini [inaudible].

22:38.544 --> 22:43.074
Even in the Bible, it is: “I will appear
before you as tongues of flames."

22:43.074 --> 22:45.864
“Tree of life” so many things are described!

22:45.864 --> 22:51.694
But in the little time that they had, they
could not explain so much.

22:51.694 --> 22:56.274
Now, these people have talked about Kundalini
and said about it.

22:56.274 --> 23:05.274
If I have done any work, is this, that by
studying through human beings, I met many

23:05.274 --> 23:10.154
people because my father was a very social
man and my husband was in a position where

23:10.154 --> 23:11.544
I met many people.

23:11.544 --> 23:20.094
I studied human beings and I found out a method
by which you can now give a-mass Realization.

23:20.094 --> 23:27.314
In Russia, in Bulgaria, Romania, we always
have people in the stadium, not less than

23:27.314 --> 23:32.194
sixteen thousand, and they all get their Realization!

23:32.194 --> 23:35.814
And they are very sensitive to spirituality
and they stick to it.

23:35.814 --> 23:38.274
None of these false gurus could stick there.

23:38.274 --> 23:42.564
Interviewer: Psychics, the issue of psychics,
it’s so popular here!

23:42.564 --> 23:46.414
And we are very-it’s very dangerous.

23:46.414 --> 23:47.904
Could you explain what can happen?

23:47.904 --> 23:49.144
Shri Mataji: Ah.

23:49.144 --> 23:52.414
Americans are very simple people I must say.

23:52.414 --> 23:56.644
First time I came for parapsychology, they
took Me into a hall of parapsychology.

23:56.644 --> 24:00.284
They told Me: “You are dealing with dead
spirits!”

24:00.284 --> 24:02.624
And they were very angry with Me.

24:02.624 --> 24:05.114
He says that: “You come as guest and why
do crusade?

24:05.114 --> 24:06.114
[unsure]."

24:06.114 --> 24:07.554
I said: “I have to tell you the truth, I
am your Mother.

24:07.554 --> 24:10.144
I’m not your guest, you didn’t pay for
Me.

24:10.144 --> 24:15.024
I came on my own, coming on my vehicle and
going on my vehicle”, while they made money

24:15.024 --> 24:16.024
out of Me.

24:16.024 --> 24:18.114
So, they don’t like it.

24:18.114 --> 24:24.854
When I first came here, when I told them that:
“These are all spirits and psychic things

24:24.854 --> 24:27.264
and don’t do it”, they didn’t like it.

24:27.264 --> 24:29.084
Interviewer: How can we know of false guru?

24:29.084 --> 24:35.374
Shri Mataji: First of all, you cannot pay
for your Self Realization!

24:35.374 --> 24:37.404
Or for any knowledge.

24:37.404 --> 24:38.904
You must value your life.

24:38.904 --> 24:43.874
If you don’t value your life, then you’ll
go to all such stupid people and you’ll

24:43.874 --> 24:44.874
waste your time.

24:44.874 --> 24:51.104
No, if you value you life, if you value your
money for example, you’ll first find out

24:51.104 --> 24:53.174
what it this you are buying.

24:53.174 --> 25:01.434
First of all you must see the disciples, what
are they doing, what is their style what are

25:01.434 --> 25:03.554
they gaining, what is their knowledge.

25:03.554 --> 25:05.414
First the disciples!

25:05.414 --> 25:07.634
Most of them are recluses.

25:07.634 --> 25:12.134
Anything which is sort of fashionable, people
want to do.

25:12.134 --> 25:15.704
You talk of individuality, all right?

25:15.704 --> 25:19.934
Any entrepreneur, now they just started a
six inches of skirt, everybody wears six inches

25:19.934 --> 25:21.074
of skirt!

25:21.074 --> 25:24.634
Otherwise you are not “in”, means in the
lunatic asylum.

25:24.634 --> 25:31.684
So like that, these people are good at big
advertisement, marketing, writing books, all

25:31.684 --> 25:32.684
falsehood!

25:32.684 --> 25:39.254
You believe them because they have a knack,
advertisement is the main thing which has

25:39.254 --> 25:45.374
led to this kind of things and Americans are
really very sensitive to advertising.

25:45.374 --> 25:47.824
If anything is advertised, they think it’s
great.

25:47.824 --> 25:54.154
Also I was surprised when I came here, they
asked Me – in Boston, I remember- they asked

25:54.154 --> 25:57.744
Me: “How many Roll Royce you have?”, in
the television.

25:57.744 --> 25:59.214
I said: “I don’t have!”

25:59.214 --> 26:01.784
They said then: “You don’t make any money."

26:01.784 --> 26:02.784
“No."

26:02.784 --> 26:03.784
I said: “I don’t make any money."

26:03.784 --> 26:04.784
“So there’s no business."

26:04.784 --> 26:05.784
“No”, I said “no”.

26:05.784 --> 26:06.784
“Then we are not interested."

26:06.784 --> 26:09.924
They wouldn’t have Me on the television.

26:09.924 --> 26:16.284
I mean you are so money oriented that tomorrow
you’ll purchase God also I think.

26:16.284 --> 26:19.794
So, first of all, you cannot pay for it.

26:19.794 --> 26:25.204
Second, you must see the disciples, what sort
of disciples they are, what they are, how

26:25.204 --> 26:30.124
much they are talking about the knowledge.

26:30.124 --> 26:31.674
They must have the knowledge.

26:31.674 --> 26:44.994
Now you know very well, and people can find
out that in Sahaja Yoga people just get Realization

26:44.994 --> 26:47.674
and start giving Realizations to others.

26:47.674 --> 26:50.784
So many diseases have been cured.

26:50.784 --> 26:52.034
It’s a fact, there’s a book written.

26:52.034 --> 26:53.434
Interviewer: So we are in a new stage, a new
evolution.

26:53.434 --> 26:58.764
Shri Mataji: Of course, this is the time,
if you miss it, you’ll miss it for ever!

26:58.764 --> 27:04.264
Because, you see, otherwise, you see in America,
people are getting destroyed from within.

27:04.264 --> 27:10.394
All kinds of diseases, psychological problems,
this, that, stress, this, that, all kind of

27:10.394 --> 27:11.904
things are going on.

27:11.904 --> 27:16.464
Now, to stop it, better ascend above all these
things.

27:16.464 --> 27:19.094
Interviewer: Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi.

27:19.094 --> 27:49.574
Please join us for part two of this special
program on “Audrey Hope’s real women”.
