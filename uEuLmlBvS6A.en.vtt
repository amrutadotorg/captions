00:00:38.139 --> 00:00:48.180
This falls on the day of famous great full moon,

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:56.347
it is called as Sharada Indu, that's the name of the Goddess also

00:00:56.389 --> 00:01:02.806
Sharada Indu; the moon on this autumn season.

00:01:02.831 --> 00:01:10.138
This is the biggest moon, and - of course not in England,

00:01:11.014 --> 00:01:18.430
but in India - that day the moon is giving the greatest light,

00:01:19.138 --> 00:01:27.180
and it's such a great thing that Guru Nanaka was born on such a day.

00:01:28.139 --> 00:01:35.138
As you know in India people celebrate birthdays

00:01:35.139 --> 00:01:39.514
according to dates of the moon, called as tithi

00:01:40.138 --> 00:01:50.514
not as the dates we have here according to the sun.

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:19.556
This great personality was born in Punjab

00:02:20.347 --> 00:02:27.931
where people were unaware of God's ways.

00:02:33.889 --> 00:02:45.889
He was always bothered about the Dharma in all his lives,

00:02:46.973 --> 00:02:50.139
because as you know he was the Primal Master,

00:02:50.806 --> 00:02:58.430
and the Primal Master is always placed

00:02:59.138 --> 00:03:01.931
in looking after our Void,

00:03:02.681 --> 00:03:08.806
in sustaining us, and giving us a model of an ideal master.

00:03:09.597 --> 00:03:19.305
And he always took birth either in the most difficult places

00:03:19.347 --> 00:03:23.806
like hills and dales and mountains, or they took places --

00:03:24.202 --> 00:03:31.389
which are even more difficult thing, among the people who were horrid,

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:35.139
and who needed their help.

00:03:35.806 --> 00:03:43.138
So in India, that time somehow Punjab was regarded as the place

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:55.931
where people did not respect God or traditional Hindu idols,

00:03:56.597 --> 00:04:07.848
or you can say the statues that were regarded as the vibrating ones.

00:04:08.472 --> 00:04:14.139
But they worshipped money (even now)

00:04:14.681 --> 00:04:19.764
and they worshipped power.

00:04:20.264 --> 00:04:31.305
And as at that time there was a King who was very anxious

00:04:31.347 --> 00:04:34.889
to convert people to Islamic Religion by giving them money,

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.722
many were taking to Islam.

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:45.514
As a result the Hindus started hating the muslims

00:04:46.138 --> 00:04:51.180
and a big hatred developed among Muslims and Hindus.

00:04:54.556 --> 00:05:00.014
That's how, in those circumstances where there was a quarrel going on

00:05:00.014 --> 00:05:04.681
between the followers of Mohammad and followers of Hinduism,

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:09.472
Mohammad himself took his birth on this earth,

00:05:09.472 --> 00:05:14.889
though he had decided not to take any more births,

00:05:14.931 --> 00:05:17.139
he thought that it would solve the problem.

00:05:17.806 --> 00:05:21.472
Although, this incarnation is such that it never dies.

00:05:22.138 --> 00:05:35.597
Even if they leave the body, they are always around.

00:05:35.597 --> 00:05:40.180
And they are the ones who perform lots of miracles

00:05:40.722 --> 00:05:44.264
when any other incarnation comes on this earth.

00:05:45.597 --> 00:05:49.180
They help support and guide the seekers

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:51.056
to go to the incarnations.

00:05:51.681 --> 00:05:54.556
So, to celebrate his birthday

00:05:56.681 --> 00:06:03.264
on such a date is also a myth,

00:06:03.305 --> 00:06:07.138
because he never died. He is eternally living.

00:06:07.681 --> 00:06:12.264
They never grow and they never die.

00:06:12.848 --> 00:06:16.305
But his birth is important,

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:21.848
because symbolically he came on this earth

00:06:21.848 --> 00:06:29.014
not to propogate any particular type of the void --

00:06:29.056 --> 00:06:35.764
as Mohammad did or say Moses did, and before that Abraham,

00:06:35.764 --> 00:06:47.556
Lao Tse, or Socrates - which followed into a religion.

00:06:48.222 --> 00:06:54.848
But he came to create amity - we can say, to create understanding,

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:58.138
to create unity between religions.

00:06:58.681 --> 00:07:01.722
This was a very big step for Sahaja Yoga.

00:07:02.138 --> 00:07:07.973
After that as you know, he was born again - God knows where --

00:07:08.639 --> 00:07:12.639
no one knows where he was born, but he appeared as Shirdi Sai Nath.

00:07:13.098 --> 00:07:19.848
He too said the same thing, that to talk ill of any religion is a sin.

00:07:20.389 --> 00:07:33.098
But these efforts are quite lost.

00:07:33.681 --> 00:07:38.597
Because the people who were Islamic at that time,

00:07:39.098 --> 00:07:46.264
or those who were Hindus, are now very great fanatics.

00:07:46.931 --> 00:07:50.722
So instead of them coming closer and loving each other

00:07:51.222 --> 00:07:52.722
they have become fanatics.

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:05.639
Though we find that Islam is spreading so fast

00:08:06.389 --> 00:08:09.597
Sikhism is spreading very fast too.

00:08:09.597 --> 00:08:15.098
In America there is a horrible guru he has started to spread Sikhism.

00:08:15.098 --> 00:08:19.138
He's converting all the white skinned people into Sikhs.

00:08:19.556 --> 00:08:24.722
They are growing their hair, and they are also growing their beard,

00:08:25.139 --> 00:08:29.139
and wearing a kara and all those five things

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:32.098
that were required at the time of Guru Gobind Singh.

00:08:32.138 --> 00:08:36.014
When the war had started they had to wear all these things,

00:08:36.139 --> 00:08:37.681
which was important.

00:08:38.430 --> 00:08:45.514
Because war had started and to protect Hinduism or Hindus

00:08:46.138 --> 00:08:48.931
from the invasion of the Muslims --

00:08:49.347 --> 00:08:52.138
the fanaticism of the Muslims --

00:08:52.722 --> 00:08:57.722
they took to this kind of a military stuff.

00:08:58.264 --> 00:09:02.139
Actually if you believe in God - nothing can be killed.

00:09:02.681 --> 00:09:07.514
But I think that Guru Gobind thought that he had to take it.

00:09:08.014 --> 00:09:11.848
In all these prophetic religions, if you see, all the prophets

00:09:11.848 --> 00:09:15.681
who have spread all the religions, they were always attacked so badly

00:09:15.973 --> 00:09:17.973
that they had to take to weapons.

00:09:18.139 --> 00:09:21.347
Even in Islam they had to take to weapons to protect themselves.

00:09:23.264 --> 00:09:24.556
Now when these people took to weapons

00:09:24.597 --> 00:09:28.222
they had some discipline put on the people.

00:09:29.056 --> 00:09:33.931
Without the discipline nothing is possible.

00:09:34.639 --> 00:09:38.305
And very strict discipline was there for the Sikhs.

00:09:38.305 --> 00:09:41.180
Now today's Sikhs are no more Sikhs,

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:44.180
they are just outside, and inside they are not.

00:09:50.764 --> 00:09:55.889
I would not describe all the strictness and discipline

00:09:55.889 --> 00:10:05.347
they had to go through. But every disciple has to go

00:10:05.389 --> 00:10:09.681
through a very severe disciplining of himself

00:10:10.305 --> 00:10:15.056
if he has to become the Guru. There is no doubt about it.

00:10:16.973 --> 00:10:21.931
It is not that only somebody like Me comes and tells you

00:10:21.973 --> 00:10:24.848
do this do that, and next day you forget these things.

00:10:24.848 --> 00:10:29.222
It is very serious matter, one has to understand.

00:10:31.139 --> 00:10:33.472
You have got your realization through Sahaja Yoga

00:10:33.472 --> 00:10:36.389
Now you have become Sahaja Yogis.

00:10:36.931 --> 00:10:41.098
But still I would say you are not full Sahaja Yogis

00:10:41.138 --> 00:10:43.806
because every Sahaja Yogi has to be a Guru

00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:46.180
Otherwise he is not a Sahaja Yogi.

00:10:46.222 --> 00:10:52.806
First of all you are Yogis because you got your realisation.

00:10:53.931 --> 00:10:57.430
But Yogis are of no use, you have to be Sahaja Yogis.

00:10:57.472 --> 00:11:00.139
So you were told about all the chakras,

00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:08.305
every thing that you are doing, about all the problems of Kundalini

00:11:08.305 --> 00:11:11.597
how to cure them. Everything about it was told to you.

00:11:11.597 --> 00:11:20.014
Now you became, with that, a different type of a race,

00:11:20.056 --> 00:11:23.848
a different type of people, who are twice-born,

00:11:24.931 --> 00:11:29.180
who are born by the Spirit, not by the flesh.

00:11:29.681 --> 00:11:32.973
Remember that that's a very important point and which John has said.

00:11:33.014 --> 00:11:37.639
That you are born by the Spirit not by the flesh.

00:11:37.639 --> 00:11:40.681
Those who are born by the flesh are in flesh.

00:11:40.681 --> 00:11:45.556
But if you are born by the Spirit, that's how you are twice born.

00:11:45.597 --> 00:11:50.681
And when you know all about the Spirit and the Kundalini

00:11:50.722 --> 00:11:52.514
then you are a Sahaja Yogi.

00:11:52.556 --> 00:11:55.889
But unless and until you become Guru,

00:11:55.931 --> 00:11:59.848
you are not a full Sahaja Yogi.

00:11:59.889 --> 00:12:05.222
So to begin with, we must understand that the Spirit is described

00:12:05.264 --> 00:12:08.556
as a Kala, a a phase of Moon, one phase of moon.

00:12:10.514 --> 00:12:15.139
But a Guru is described as the full moon - purnima -Guru Purnima.

00:12:15.764 --> 00:12:19.514
Guru is the full moon, it's not just a phase.

00:12:20.098 --> 00:12:25.931
So from one phase you have to go to the stage

00:12:26.389 --> 00:12:29.347
where you become a complete Guru.

00:12:29.514 --> 00:12:33.056
16 phases there are altogether,

00:12:33.098 --> 00:12:40.180
and you have ro cross the 16 stages to become the Guru.

00:12:40.597 --> 00:12:42.389
Now how do we do it?

00:12:43.597 --> 00:12:47.098
We have to become extremely objective about it.

00:12:47.098 --> 00:12:48.931
How do we become the Guru?

00:12:48.973 --> 00:12:50.639
Because we have to become Gurus, no doubt.

00:12:50.639 --> 00:12:54.056
Now you cannot just say that, Mother you give us a tape

00:12:54.098 --> 00:12:57.430
and we'll learn by heart and we'll go on to another person

00:12:57.472 --> 00:12:59.305
saying blah blah blah blah blah.

00:12:59.347 --> 00:13:02.180
Same thing, whetever I've told you, or take my type

00:13:02.222 --> 00:13:05.098
and show them that this is our Mother,

00:13:05.138 --> 00:13:10.389
and She's like this and like that. But they will say alright

00:13:11.014 --> 00:13:13.597
She may be, but what about you. Sir ?

00:13:15.056 --> 00:13:20.597
Now Sahaja Yoga has a 'very' big responsibility,

00:13:20.639 --> 00:13:22.639
which I don't think people understand.

00:13:22.681 --> 00:13:27.681
I wish they could listen to me very intensely and understand it.

00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:33.389
So far if you see. Gurus remained Gurus

00:13:33.389 --> 00:13:35.472
and no disciples became Gurus.

00:13:38.138 --> 00:13:40.639
They were still regarded as disciples of a Guru,

00:13:40.681 --> 00:13:42.514
whether it was fake or anything.

00:13:44.014 --> 00:13:46.138
They never became Gurus themselves.

00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:50.764
So there was no need for them to grow,

00:13:50.806 --> 00:13:53.556
they had to take the name of their Guru alright.

00:13:54.139 --> 00:13:58.556
Christ and his disciples, Mohammad Sahib had his own disciples.

00:13:59.138 --> 00:14:04.722
Nanaka had his own disciples, Shirdi Sai Nath had his own disciples.

00:14:05.264 --> 00:14:07.639
None of them became Gurus.

00:14:08.138 --> 00:14:12.180
But now it is in your lot, sorry to say,

00:14:12.639 --> 00:14:15.430
that you have to become the Gurus.

00:14:16.138 --> 00:14:18.722
It's a privilege, actually.

00:14:19.139 --> 00:14:22.430
It's a very great privilege to become the Guru.

00:14:22.889 --> 00:14:28.180
And to become the Guru, we must learn what we have to do.

00:14:28.681 --> 00:14:33.347
This also sometimes becomes just a lecture. I think so.

00:14:33.931 --> 00:14:36.681
Because I've already told you on Guru Purnima

00:14:36.722 --> 00:14:39.138
what are the 10 attainments we have to have.

00:14:39.514 --> 00:14:44.764
Today all these 16 stages are to be seen,

00:14:44.764 --> 00:14:49.931
how we have to grow into a Guru.

00:14:50.556 --> 00:14:59.639
First is, we have complete discipline put on ourselves.

00:15:00.056 --> 00:15:03.764
Like Mr Nick is attacked by everyone.

00:15:05.347 --> 00:15:09.138
No, you attack yourself. You become Mr Nick now.

00:15:12.597 --> 00:15:17.722
You have to make this body subservient to you,

00:15:17.764 --> 00:15:19.681
that is the first mastery.

00:15:20.098 --> 00:15:23.681
The mastery is that my body can sleep anywhere,

00:15:24.138 --> 00:15:30.264
it can starve itself, it can live under any circumstances,

00:15:30.639 --> 00:15:32.722
it dare not grudge.

00:15:32.848 --> 00:15:37.639
Anywhere; it should be able to sleep any time,

00:15:37.681 --> 00:15:39.848
it should be able to keep awake anytime.

00:15:40.681 --> 00:15:42.764
This body is to be mastered.

00:15:43.764 --> 00:15:46.347
Even if you read 'Ashtanga Yoga'

00:15:46.389 --> 00:15:48.931
first thing is mastery over the body, they say.

00:15:48.973 --> 00:15:52.138
So after realisation the first thing you have to do

00:15:52.139 --> 00:15:53.597
is master this body,

00:15:53.639 --> 00:15:57.681
and is the most difficult thing for western people;

00:15:58.389 --> 00:16:00.472
because the matter is sitting on their Spirit.

00:16:02.597 --> 00:16:05.889
First the Spirit has to come - first phase --

00:16:06.472 --> 00:16:08.639
at least the Spirit has to be there.

00:16:09.848 --> 00:16:16.098
If you have to be the Spirit then thematter of moon

00:16:16.098 --> 00:16:18.514
has to be covered with that light.

00:16:19.347 --> 00:16:22.430
In the first phase we have to master our body.

00:16:22.973 --> 00:16:26.305
So what do we do to master our body ?

00:16:27.305 --> 00:16:30.973
First of all we must see that what are the things

00:16:31.389 --> 00:16:36.556
that drain out our bodily mastery.

00:16:37.138 --> 00:16:41.889
We must know all the crooks who try to master us.

00:16:42.305 --> 00:17:06.764
So I have to first face my body.

00:17:09.931 --> 00:17:14.681
That first and foremost thing in Sahaja Yoga we learn

00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:17.806
that we have to respect our body.

00:17:18.222 --> 00:17:22.973
This is the first principle of respecting our body.

00:17:23.472 --> 00:17:26.389
Means indulgence is sinful to the body,

00:17:26.848 --> 00:17:32.681
because indulgence gives you a body which is no good:

00:17:34.931 --> 00:17:37.681
First of all you must respect your body

00:17:37.722 --> 00:17:39.931
so that you can master it.

00:17:40.139 --> 00:17:42.264
If I do not respect you, I cannot master you.

00:17:42.681 --> 00:17:46.430
So to master the body first of all respect your body.

00:17:47.889 --> 00:17:52.430
And to respect your body, you must look after your body very well.

00:17:54.014 --> 00:17:55.639
But no indulgence.

00:17:56.138 --> 00:17:59.430
That doesn't mean that you go and stand in the mud

00:17:59.889 --> 00:18:03.889
or rain for hours together or get exposed,

00:18:04.597 --> 00:18:12.222
to make your body absolutely sort of a abode for all the diseases

00:18:12.264 --> 00:18:14.389
and colds and coughs and things like that

00:18:14.806 --> 00:18:19.472
so your Mother suffers cleaning your vishuddhi!

00:18:23.305 --> 00:18:26.222
It's like a horse whose neck is down.

00:18:28.681 --> 00:18:33.264
So you must look after your body by hot giving it diseases.

00:18:33.889 --> 00:18:36.514
Laziness is against it.

00:18:36.973 --> 00:18:38.848
Persons who are lazy must know

00:18:38.889 --> 00:18:41.556
that laziness is against your body.

00:18:41.556 --> 00:18:45.264
Lazy people who are not bothered to dress up properly,

00:18:45.722 --> 00:18:49.764
to cover themselves up properly, look after their body properly,

00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:57.430
put oil into different screws that they have, to massage themselves.

00:18:58.014 --> 00:19:00.597
Look after the body, that's the point.

00:19:01.014 --> 00:19:04.848
To look after the body you must give some time,

00:19:04.889 --> 00:19:07.430
because this body is the temple of God.

00:19:07.472 --> 00:19:09.889
And now you have become the temple

00:19:09.931 --> 00:19:11.556
but if the temple is dirty,

00:19:11.597 --> 00:19:20.056
is sick, is unimpressive, is like a stick, or like a balloon,

00:19:20.389 --> 00:19:23.389
nobody is going to come near it.

00:19:25.472 --> 00:19:28.305
So try to improve your personality,

00:19:29.806 --> 00:19:32.764
that it has to be a beautiful temple.

00:19:35.264 --> 00:19:39.722
I mean, I have given you so many tips, that I think

00:19:39.722 --> 00:19:43.556
that in my lives' time I have not given so many tips, even as Guru.

00:19:44.597 --> 00:19:47.722
Because normally people who came to a Guru in those days

00:19:47.764 --> 00:19:50.305
were really, really great seekers.

00:19:50.430 --> 00:19:53.639
They would hang themselves upside down, just to please the Guru,

00:19:54.222 --> 00:19:56.014
for months together.

00:19:59.347 --> 00:20:03.305
So that was a very different quality people -- but one or two.

00:20:04.056 --> 00:20:07.472
And when you have quantity quality goes down, I accept.

00:20:07.764 --> 00:20:11.138
But why not you people take it upon yourselves

00:20:11.139 --> 00:20:13.639
that we'll make our quality first class ?

00:20:13.681 --> 00:20:15.889
So first of all train up your body well.

00:20:18.472 --> 00:20:21.472
You must take some exercises in the morning, I have told you.

00:20:22.472 --> 00:20:25.098
That people sleep after breakfast I am told,

00:20:25.138 --> 00:20:29.430
I was amazed. I mean, this is too much.

00:20:29.931 --> 00:20:34.806
You see, God has given you this house as a blessing,

00:20:37.014 --> 00:20:43.264
to be more alert, to give His light to others.

00:20:43.305 --> 00:20:51.222
Instead of that if the candle is not even flickering what's the use.

00:20:53.514 --> 00:20:59.222
So what you have to do is to first of all brush up, yourself, completely.

00:21:00.056 --> 00:21:02.639
Make your body alright, alert.

00:21:03.347 --> 00:21:06.222
Actually at your age one should not sleep

00:21:06.222 --> 00:21:10.098
for more than six or seven hours, I tell you. No need.

00:21:11.889 --> 00:21:14.222
Six or seven hours of deep sleep is sufficient.

00:21:16.014 --> 00:21:19.889
I also, in the night I sleep about --

00:21:19.889 --> 00:21:22.430
never before eleven sometimes at twelve,

00:21:22.472 --> 00:21:26.389
Yesterday we slept at 20'clock, got up at 5. 30 as usual.

00:21:26.430 --> 00:21:29.472
So how many ? Three and a half hours sleep.

00:21:29.472 --> 00:21:33.264
And just now I slept for about at the most for half an hour

00:21:33.264 --> 00:21:34.973
or an hour or so finished.

00:21:35.764 --> 00:21:40.389
When you don't have to work, like me,

00:21:41.014 --> 00:21:43.264
in the sense that even when I sleep I am working.

00:21:46.056 --> 00:21:49.180
So to rest your body for such a long time

00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:51.305
you make your body sit on your head

00:21:51.806 --> 00:21:56.139
and it will be very very difficult for you to be alert.

00:21:57.889 --> 00:22:01.139
So first of all body must be looked after.

00:22:01.764 --> 00:22:03.848
There should be no self-indulgence.

00:22:04.305 --> 00:22:07.139
I mean it can go to any extent of self indulgence.

00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:10.305
Like people don't keep their rooms clean, their clothes clean,

00:22:10.347 --> 00:22:14.514
they have no activities - all these nonsensical things,

00:22:14.556 --> 00:22:17.806
only it is too low, too base to talk about; but it happens.

00:22:18.305 --> 00:22:21.139
People can go to any base limit - you know,

00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:22.889
that's the problem, what to do?

00:22:24.889 --> 00:22:29.098
On this full moon day one has to realize

00:22:29.138 --> 00:22:32.639
that on a full moon day you are over-active.

00:22:32.848 --> 00:22:35.556
As the moon starts growing the activity starts.

00:22:35.597 --> 00:22:37.138
In the night also.

00:22:38.722 --> 00:22:41.430
But none of you so far

00:22:41.472 --> 00:22:43.305
are active in the night except for me.

00:22:44.138 --> 00:22:47.138
But if you come up you will be surprised,

00:22:47.139 --> 00:22:49.514
even in your sleep you will be active.

00:22:52.806 --> 00:22:57.764
So first and foremost thing is that you must look after your body.

00:22:57.764 --> 00:22:59.472
The body should be presentable.

00:23:00.764 --> 00:23:07.931
And should not go with the so-called fashions of the day.

00:23:07.973 --> 00:23:09.472
It is very important.

00:23:09.931 --> 00:23:12.889
One should not go with the fashions of the day,

00:23:14.389 --> 00:23:17.222
and take to something which is nonsensical,

00:23:17.806 --> 00:23:21.848
which is not good for your appearance,

00:23:22.222 --> 00:23:26.138
which makes you look funny or very fashionable

00:23:26.139 --> 00:23:27.931
like a dandy person.

00:23:28.347 --> 00:23:33.722
We have to wear a dress which is in the centre, dignified, which is good.

00:23:39.722 --> 00:23:44.806
Now I'm told that it is very difficult even to wake up in England.

00:23:45.472 --> 00:23:47.889
Somebody had told me, when I was young,

00:23:48.264 --> 00:23:50.597
that don't wake up an Englishman.

00:23:52.681 --> 00:23:56.430
I haven't tried that, even with a barge pole.

00:23:57.180 --> 00:24:00.681
I just tell you at this time, never in the morning time.

00:24:01.098 --> 00:24:03.931
Because I've been warned: never wake up an Englishman,

00:24:03.931 --> 00:24:06.222
that is the greatest sin on this earth!

00:24:12.764 --> 00:24:16.472
So why should the English be so much addicted to sleep!

00:24:17.139 --> 00:24:20.014
The whole country is sleeping today.

00:24:20.556 --> 00:24:24.430
They want more wages, more wages so that they can sleep more.

00:24:26.264 --> 00:24:30.180
Eat and drink, drink and eat in between, sleep.

00:24:30.222 --> 00:24:35.597
This is the three - programmed life.

00:24:38.472 --> 00:24:42.222
It was very difficult, from the very beginnig

00:24:42.264 --> 00:24:47.430
I saw Sahaja Yogis coming, in that to wake them up was difficult.

00:24:47.472 --> 00:24:53.222
And these are the same people who were known for punctuality

00:24:53.264 --> 00:24:57.931
that they won the war at Waterloo because of punctuality,

00:24:58.681 --> 00:25:04.098
and they were so punctual that people used to set their watches --

00:25:04.138 --> 00:25:06.931
even in America. They are the same people.

00:25:07.472 --> 00:25:11.931
Now the other side of it is that they sleep like log of wood.

00:25:12.389 --> 00:25:15.098
They used to sleep before also must be, because this is an old saying that.

00:25:15.138 --> 00:25:16.889
Don't wake up an Englishman.

00:25:17.681 --> 00:25:21.931
But I used to think something else about it why it is said,

00:25:21.931 --> 00:25:24.681
but it is nothing but simple laziness.

00:25:26.139 --> 00:25:33.056
So try to see why we sleep so much.

00:25:36.973 --> 00:25:41.098
If the left side is strong, people sleep.

00:25:42.014 --> 00:25:46.305
If the back Agnya is strong, people sleep.

00:25:46.472 --> 00:25:52.806
If the front Agnya is working too much

00:25:53.347 --> 00:25:55.722
then people don't sleep.

00:25:58.347 --> 00:26:01.347
So even if I say, "Don't sleep",

00:26:01.681 --> 00:26:06.973
it mean that you put your right Agnya in working condition,

00:26:06.973 --> 00:26:08.973
that means you start thinking.

00:26:09.014 --> 00:26:10.764
Which is against Sahaja Yoga again.

00:26:12.014 --> 00:26:14.973
So it would be left agnya, right agnya, right agnya, left agnya,

00:26:14.973 --> 00:26:16.264
left agnya, left agnya, right agnya, left agnya...

00:26:16.264 --> 00:26:18.514
It will be going from one to another.

00:26:20.597 --> 00:26:29.472
So in the centre you have to be with Christ.

00:26:33.138 --> 00:26:38.138
He is alert every second of the day;

00:26:43.931 --> 00:26:47.222
killing; beating, hitting,

00:26:48.472 --> 00:26:54.806
curing, looking after, guiding.

00:26:55.597 --> 00:27:04.681
Twenty four hours a day. And go and ask any realized soul

00:27:04.722 --> 00:27:07.389
who is called as Avadhuta, the one who is a master,

00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:11.722
they will tell you they hardly sleep for three hours or four hours.

00:27:12.389 --> 00:27:15.889
Because they cannot work when they are sleeping,

00:27:16.138 --> 00:27:17.639
so they sleep for four hours,

00:27:17.681 --> 00:27:19.556
the rest of the time they are working:

00:27:20.264 --> 00:27:24.556
either they meditate and do things by projection,

00:27:25.098 --> 00:27:28.389
or they work with their hands.

00:27:28.973 --> 00:27:31.722
They are busy people, they are very busy.

00:27:32.222 --> 00:27:39.639
You have to be very busy people because now you are employed by God.

00:27:40.138 --> 00:27:45.514
And you have to do full justice to this employment by working hard.

00:27:46.138 --> 00:27:52.389
On the contrary you have seen that it is very easy to get lazy.

00:27:58.180 --> 00:28:02.973
So now, as many of you are already feeling sleepy, put your....

00:28:03.806 --> 00:28:07.138
First thing should be for all those people who are lazy,

00:28:07.138 --> 00:28:09.931
is to put their right to the left seven times -

00:28:10.014 --> 00:28:11.305
let's have it.

00:28:14.098 --> 00:28:16.514
With the right hand....

00:28:31.931 --> 00:28:37.138
It's better? Now the back Agnya.

00:28:37.138 --> 00:28:39.014
Let's have it.

00:28:41.931 --> 00:28:48.889
Laziness is first. Shri Krishna was against laziness.

00:28:48.889 --> 00:28:53.973
Anywhere he got a chance he talked against laziness, Alasya.

00:28:55.931 --> 00:28:57.848
Now watch me.

00:28:58.764 --> 00:29:00.889
On the photograph you can do the same....

00:29:58.889 --> 00:30:00.556
Better now?

00:30:04.430 --> 00:30:08.138
Tonight we have to keep awake; it's a big problem.

00:30:09.848 --> 00:30:12.764
But don't sleep formally here. Alright ?

00:30:12.889 --> 00:30:14.806
Informally you can.

00:30:28.889 --> 00:30:30.806
Better ?

00:30:33.014 --> 00:30:36.597
Put your eyes, try Again.

00:31:08.848 --> 00:31:12.973
So the mastery should be, first of all, of your body.

00:31:14.806 --> 00:31:17.681
Say, you are sleeping on one side, you get a pain --

00:31:17.681 --> 00:31:19.889
then what do you do? You sleep on the other side.

00:31:21.681 --> 00:31:25.764
In the same way, this body is to be made

00:31:25.764 --> 00:31:29.472
immune to different shocks,

00:31:29.514 --> 00:31:32.806
you see. Like you put the watch in the water.

00:31:33.264 --> 00:31:36.597
You shock it with the water, so it is waterproof.

00:31:37.056 --> 00:31:40.305
So a Sahaja Yogi has to be an all-proofed person.

00:31:41.973 --> 00:31:50.889
So he has no place to complain,

00:31:51.597 --> 00:31:54.014
because he's supposed to be all-proof, you see.

00:31:54.056 --> 00:31:57.098
Anybody (Sahaja Yogi) who complains, you can say,

00:31:57.138 --> 00:31:58.931
"How are you complaining?

00:31:58.931 --> 00:32:00.514
Because you have to be all-proof."

00:32:02.305 --> 00:32:12.098
So no complaints of any kind, of Sahaja Yogis

00:32:12.138 --> 00:32:14.514
are to be accepted or sympathized.

00:32:20.180 --> 00:32:25.430
If you start accepting people who are complaining type

00:32:26.014 --> 00:32:28.347
you will be always busy looking after them,

00:32:28.848 --> 00:32:32.389
and you will be of no use to Sahaja Yoga.

00:32:34.138 --> 00:32:37.931
Those who have habits of complaininig and all that

00:32:37.973 --> 00:32:40.056
should go to the hospital and stay there.

00:32:40.681 --> 00:32:44.347
Complaining people are really people

00:32:44.389 --> 00:32:47.222
who have some sort of possession,

00:32:47.264 --> 00:32:51.305
I think, that they all the time complain and try to torture you,

00:32:51.848 --> 00:32:54.138
and make a nuisance out of themselves.

00:32:54.848 --> 00:32:57.138
Such people cannot become Gurus.

00:32:57.138 --> 00:33:01.973
Imagine - if the Guru is complaining then what is he going to teach?

00:33:02.014 --> 00:33:03.806
Only complaining.

00:33:04.556 --> 00:33:07.639
The teachers will be expert in complaining

00:33:07.639 --> 00:33:09.889
and the students will be also experts in complaining.

00:33:10.222 --> 00:33:15.056
So you create a set of complaining disciples, you see,

00:33:16.347 --> 00:33:18.472
And when they come to Me what I find

00:33:18.514 --> 00:33:22.264
they all have double lists than yourselves about their complaints.

00:33:24.139 --> 00:33:26.556
But also it is very characteristic.

00:33:26.597 --> 00:33:28.806
Like Australians seldom complain,

00:33:29.430 --> 00:33:32.098
and if they do complain they are hit also very badly.

00:33:32.639 --> 00:33:35.722
Seldom you will find an Australian complaining.

00:33:35.722 --> 00:33:37.889
I have got letters - except one or two

00:33:38.305 --> 00:33:41.222
who have now found themselves out - seldom

00:33:41.889 --> 00:33:46.222
they complain about themselves, about their body comforts,

00:33:46.222 --> 00:33:49.389
this thing that thing. So under any circumstances

00:33:49.931 --> 00:33:54.722
those who can live are the people

00:33:55.139 --> 00:33:57.681
who have achieved the one sixteenth,

00:33:58.138 --> 00:33:59.722
only the one sixteenth.

00:33:59.973 --> 00:34:02.681
(Jaise rakhahu taise hi rahu)

00:34:02.681 --> 00:34:06.389
Mother the way you keep it we are willing to stay.

00:34:06.931 --> 00:34:09.931
Of course the Mother has kept you very well.

00:34:13.430 --> 00:34:16.180
All the luxuries of world Mother has given you.

00:34:17.764 --> 00:34:20.514
She doesn't torture you like other Gurus have tortured.

00:34:21.014 --> 00:34:22.764
Once and for all.

00:34:23.138 --> 00:34:25.973
My Son has gone through all the tortures,

00:34:27.180 --> 00:34:32.139
there is no need to put you to any tortures or troubles.

00:34:32.347 --> 00:34:34.597
But you should see how your body reacts,

00:34:34.639 --> 00:34:39.639
and tell your body, "Yes Mr body, will you please now,

00:34:39.639 --> 00:34:42.764
behave yourself and not try to be indulgent."

00:34:44.639 --> 00:34:51.056
All these indulgences come to us through our senses.

00:34:51.556 --> 00:34:54.848
So if you can master your body

00:34:54.848 --> 00:34:57.347
you will also master your senses.

00:34:57.889 --> 00:35:08.597
For example the master, or we say the highest of the organs

00:35:08.639 --> 00:35:12.180
which controls most of the organs, I personally think, is the tongue.

00:35:12.848 --> 00:35:17.347
Because it's the primordial nonsense.

00:35:20.597 --> 00:35:26.973
By tongue we speak things to hurt others.

00:35:27.597 --> 00:35:32.347
With tongue we learn how to go on jabbering.

00:35:32.931 --> 00:35:36.806
With tongue we can show how frivolous we are.

00:35:37.514 --> 00:35:40.722
Either we are tongue tied or tongue - loose,

00:35:41.014 --> 00:35:43.639
there's nothing in between with the tongue.

00:35:43.639 --> 00:35:46.056
That's only about talking part, that's lower.

00:35:46.472 --> 00:35:50.098
But when it comes higher, eating;

00:35:52.098 --> 00:35:54.138
all the time thinking about eating.

00:35:54.138 --> 00:35:57.722
I have told you a hundred times, that Sahaja Yogis should go

00:35:57.722 --> 00:36:03.222
on really sometimes on absolutely bland boiled horrible food --

00:36:04.639 --> 00:36:11.639
just to test the tongue. Do it, try this, then try this.

00:36:11.889 --> 00:36:15.806
My father used to tell that you must burn your tongue a little bit.

00:36:16.305 --> 00:36:18.848
That's one of the tests he said one should do.

00:36:18.848 --> 00:36:21.056
But he was a hard taskmaster as a Guru.

00:36:21.639 --> 00:36:24.722
So we should see what our tongue can bear,

00:36:25.305 --> 00:36:28.138
is it fussy about food ?

00:36:33.056 --> 00:36:38.222
When it sees the food does it start watering, first of all;

00:36:42.514 --> 00:36:45.430
does it take our attention to food,

00:36:46.014 --> 00:36:47.931
is food important to us?

00:36:48.430 --> 00:37:00.973
So the first thing, to overcome the problem of your tongue is

00:37:00.973 --> 00:37:05.722
"to starve." Starvation is the only way

00:37:05.764 --> 00:37:09.264
you can correct yourself. You see if you starve yourself --

00:37:09.347 --> 00:37:15.848
say, morning just have little to eat, reduce it to half.

00:37:15.889 --> 00:37:18.722
You'll be surprised your intestine will be halved also.

00:37:18.722 --> 00:37:21.639
After some time you cannot eat more even if you want to.

00:37:22.347 --> 00:37:26.639
Your interest will go off. Train up yourself.

00:37:26.681 --> 00:37:28.681
Starvation is a very good thing.

00:37:28.681 --> 00:37:32.180
I think 40 days that Christ did is a very good idea.

00:37:34.722 --> 00:37:39.722
But that should not be a kind of a thing that like - they have Ramazan,

00:37:40.098 --> 00:37:45.806
that they eat the most s..... food during that time early in the morning

00:37:45.806 --> 00:37:48.222
then the whole day they starve - thinking about food!

00:37:51.430 --> 00:37:57.514
Starve yourself fully and don't think about food.

00:37:57.514 --> 00:37:59.764
That's difficult so starve yourself  in halfway

00:38:00.138 --> 00:38:01.639
and dont think about food.

00:38:03.098 --> 00:38:05.848
Gradually try to master your tongue.

00:38:06.597 --> 00:38:10.180
Mastery of your tongue is only possible if you know

00:38:10.222 --> 00:38:13.389
how to starve your day. This is for the western side.

00:38:13.472 --> 00:38:17.430
For eastern side they fast morning till evening.

00:38:18.681 --> 00:38:21.056
I know one lady, if you ask them they say

00:38:21.098 --> 00:38:25.139
"I observe Monday, I observe Tuesday, I observe Wednesday,

00:38:25.180 --> 00:38:28.764
I observe Thursday, I observe Friday a fast,

00:38:28.806 --> 00:38:35.014
and perhaps maybe if I do not starve Saturday I will eat on Sunday."

00:38:35.848 --> 00:38:39.139
I have know such people in my life time - many --

00:38:39.681 --> 00:38:41.848
who just go on fasting.

00:38:41.848 --> 00:38:43.973
They are such experts and astute? you see,

00:38:44.597 --> 00:38:48.514
that they can show you that they can fast for 50 days, 80 days,

00:38:48.514 --> 00:38:52.556
108 days, and 300 days.

00:38:53.056 --> 00:38:55.139
Starving masters.

00:38:55.639 --> 00:38:59.389
So for them I have to tell, "you have to eat'', when they are starve.

00:38:59.430 --> 00:39:01.014
To you I have to say,

00:39:01.014 --> 00:39:04.681
"Let us see which day we can starve ourselves."

00:39:04.681 --> 00:39:11.138
Let us have one day to celebrate today's great day of Nanaka!

00:39:11.138 --> 00:39:14.806
One day let us starve. Which day should we?

00:39:17.056 --> 00:39:21.889
Monday we cannot because Monday we have a programme,

00:39:23.472 --> 00:39:29.056
Tuesday we cannot because it is a day when Hanuman has to work,

00:39:32.722 --> 00:39:35.764
Wednesday we cannot, because then the creativity takes place,

00:39:37.347 --> 00:39:40.639
Thursday we cannot because we are Guru at that day,

00:39:40.681 --> 00:39:43.889
we have to work very hard as Gurus, Friday we cannot,

00:39:43.931 --> 00:39:46.056
we have to work the shakti of Mother,

00:39:46.056 --> 00:39:48.556
Saturday we cannot because we have to do

00:39:48.556 --> 00:39:52.430
all the intrigue of Shri Krishna.

00:39:53.138 --> 00:39:56.347
And Sunday how can it be, this is the day of the sun!"

00:39:59.056 --> 00:40:03.138
So which is the best day for starving, now let us see.

00:40:04.305 --> 00:40:10.597
We should have Thursday, because Thursday is the Guru's day

00:40:10.931 --> 00:40:15.597
and let us do some fasting, half day, half day can we?

00:40:15.639 --> 00:40:18.848
Can we start with half day then f... day?

00:40:18.848 --> 00:40:21.848
Thursday let us have, maybe second half

00:40:21.848 --> 00:40:24.222
because breakfast is essential I think.

00:40:25.305 --> 00:40:28.556
Without breakfast you see, the horses cannot whinny,

00:40:31.222 --> 00:40:33.305
so let us have the second half

00:40:36.681 --> 00:40:39.056
or we can have the first half.

00:40:39.806 --> 00:40:45.430
Actually you have to discipline yourself, if you have to be the Gurus.

00:40:45.472 --> 00:40:48.222
It's like going to a college,

00:40:48.430 --> 00:40:50.264
when you are left to yourself,

00:40:50.305 --> 00:40:53.180
it is you, who has to discipline yourself,

00:40:53.222 --> 00:40:56.138
nobody has to tell you that you do this and do that

00:40:56.138 --> 00:40:58.347
That's the measure to wake you up.

00:40:58.389 --> 00:41:01.430
In India it is the other way around.

00:41:01.430 --> 00:41:04.764
If you tell somebody that you have to wake up at 5,

00:41:05.556 --> 00:41:10.806
the person who has told you will be awakened at 4 o' clock himself,

00:41:10.848 --> 00:41:15.139
the one who has told; so that he doesn't get up to wake him up.

00:41:15.889 --> 00:41:17.639
Did you follow me?

00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:20.889
And the whole house will be awakened at 4 o'clock

00:41:21.305 --> 00:41:24.264
so that they can take up the duty from the person

00:41:24.264 --> 00:41:25.764
who has to get awakened.

00:41:28.098 --> 00:41:29.889
But the fellow who has to awaken

00:41:29.931 --> 00:41:31.597
might not sleep the whole night.

00:41:32.556 --> 00:41:36.014
It is just the other way round, the other extreme of it.

00:41:36.430 --> 00:41:42.764
Say if I am there, one night I sleep there. If I get up

00:41:43.305 --> 00:41:46.514
at one o'clock I find all of them sitting and meditating,

00:41:46.514 --> 00:41:49.138
in the passage, up to the bathroom everywhere.

00:41:49.139 --> 00:41:52.180
They have not gone home, not taken food, nothing.

00:41:52.681 --> 00:41:55.222
Just meditating, taking vibrations, correcting.

00:41:55.222 --> 00:41:56.889
I am sleeping inside.

00:41:56.889 --> 00:41:59.138
In the night I want to go to the bathroom,

00:41:59.138 --> 00:42:01.264
I just cannot go because they are all meditating.

00:42:01.305 --> 00:42:03.472
Nobody is sleeping, nobody is sleeping.

00:42:09.889 --> 00:42:12.180
So it is the other way around.

00:42:13.138 --> 00:42:15.806
So to you people let us do one day.

00:42:15.806 --> 00:42:21.138
That you must have one day fasting, one day keeping, one awake.

00:42:21.681 --> 00:42:24.222
Which day should it be? Let's see.

00:42:27.222 --> 00:42:29.806
A day when there is no film!

00:42:37.597 --> 00:42:44.848
Half night, second half I mean, not the first half.

00:42:48.722 --> 00:43:00.139
Which day? Which is the most difficult day when you cannot,

00:43:02.138 --> 00:43:09.973
cannot keep awake. Sunday night;

00:43:10.973 --> 00:43:13.597
but there's a fiIm on!

00:43:16.305 --> 00:43:19.639
Without the film, you see!

00:43:19.639 --> 00:43:22.722
Treat yourself like that, joke with yourself,

00:43:22.722 --> 00:43:25.556
now Sunday night is there a film on?

00:43:25.597 --> 00:43:27.222
After 12 there isn't.

00:43:27.264 --> 00:43:29.597
So Sunday night you get up at 12 o'clock.

00:43:29.639 --> 00:43:36.931
Let's have it. Enjoy it. Don't get angry.

00:43:38.973 --> 00:43:41.098
Make a fun out of it.

00:43:43.973 --> 00:43:48.138
You think more about it, then you get upset.

00:43:48.139 --> 00:43:50.180
You just don't think about it, then you'll enjoy it.

00:43:50.180 --> 00:43:51.722
It's like swimming.

00:43:51.764 --> 00:43:56.264
Get up at 12 o'clock, all of you, go for a bath, sit down,

00:43:56.305 --> 00:43:59.973
sing Bhajans, this, that, let us do it. Should we ?

00:44:04.722 --> 00:44:07.681
Michel, What happen with you?

00:44:07.722 --> 00:44:14.180
"I can go to bed at two o clock"

00:44:14.180 --> 00:44:18.098
You have to get up at 12 o'clock,

00:44:18.098 --> 00:44:22.139
you have to go to bed till 12 o'clock.

00:44:22.180 --> 00:44:24.139
Get up at 12 o'clock.

00:44:24.180 --> 00:44:28.138
You see the first half of the night, one must sleep always, it's better.

00:44:28.347 --> 00:44:32.639
Second half of the night is the better part, alright?

00:44:32.848 --> 00:44:36.014
So the first half of the night you all have to sleep, anytime.

00:44:36.056 --> 00:44:39.139
You can sleep about 8 o'clock or 9 o'clock if you want to.

00:44:41.681 --> 00:44:44.889
But that should not be important, what time you sleep,

00:44:44.889 --> 00:44:48.014
you have to get up at 12 o'clock in the morning,

00:44:48.681 --> 00:44:50.848
or say after 12.

00:44:54.722 --> 00:44:57.806
Shri Krishna was born in the night about 12 o'clock.

00:44:57.806 --> 00:45:00.014
Nanaka was born 12 o'clock in the night.

00:45:00.014 --> 00:45:04.222
All the Gurus mostly took their birth at 12 o'clock in the night.

00:45:05.056 --> 00:45:10.681
To celebrate that, we must have one day when we do not sleep after 12.

00:45:11.347 --> 00:45:15.138
But then what about Caxton Hall!

00:45:15.597 --> 00:45:18.681
"Mother we can try this on Saturday.

00:45:18.764 --> 00:45:20.264
¿What?

00:45:20.764 --> 00:45:23.389
¿Can we do it in Saturday night? It will be more safe

00:45:23.722 --> 00:45:26.389
because will be less incidents the Sunday that Monday"

00:45:26.556 --> 00:45:34.056
Alright so you can sleep in the day time of Saturday or of Sunday.

00:45:34.514 --> 00:45:36.264
Sunday afternoon you can sleep.

00:45:36.347 --> 00:45:38.597
No, no, no that won't be alright.

00:45:41.430 --> 00:45:44.014
If you make any compensation

00:45:44.056 --> 00:45:46.722
then you are not torturing your body much!

00:45:48.639 --> 00:45:51.222
You must devise a method by which

00:45:51.264 --> 00:45:54.347
your body does see that it has to get up at 12 o'clock,

00:45:54.389 --> 00:45:55.764
Better keep it that time.

00:45:55.806 --> 00:45:58.138
What do you think ? Alright.

00:45:58.138 --> 00:46:02.347
"¿Do you think that this may affect the job on Monday?"

00:46:02.389 --> 00:46:04.430
¿What he said?

00:46:04.472 --> 00:46:06.639
"That the job of the people may be affected

00:46:06.639 --> 00:46:08.222
on Monday morning, Mother".

00:46:08.264 --> 00:46:13.681
They will never, take it from me, they will not:

00:46:13.681 --> 00:46:16.138
You see work is not important what is important

00:46:16.139 --> 00:46:21.639
is your Spirit, your mastery.

00:46:21.681 --> 00:46:25.180
Work, in any case you're not going to have after some time,

00:46:25.931 --> 00:46:28.180
so that work is not important.

00:46:28.222 --> 00:46:31.472
This new work that you have taken, better look after that.

00:46:31.472 --> 00:46:35.472
Forget about your work. Forget about these things.

00:46:35.514 --> 00:46:38.098
What is important is your Spirit.

00:46:38.138 --> 00:46:40.347
Otherwise you cannot become Gurus.

00:46:41.138 --> 00:46:43.138
Spirit is the most important thing.

00:46:43.139 --> 00:46:46.806
The rest of the things are absolutely unimportant,

00:46:46.806 --> 00:46:48.722
a zero.

00:46:51.556 --> 00:46:56.347
I've been very slowly trying to take you out

00:46:56.389 --> 00:47:00.806
of the mud of materialism and of these mundane things.

00:47:01.305 --> 00:47:06.430
But you have to work for God. You are special people.

00:47:07.973 --> 00:47:12.389
So, you have to make yourself a master,

00:47:14.098 --> 00:47:19.430
so God gives you all the blessings, everything.

00:47:20.430 --> 00:47:23.848
But the idea of luxurious life must be given up.

00:47:24.556 --> 00:47:28.056
People want to make this life luxurious,

00:47:28.931 --> 00:47:31.347
then you'll have the luxury of this world

00:47:31.389 --> 00:47:34.472
but not the luxury of God's blessings.

00:47:35.014 --> 00:47:37.098
One of the two you have to select.

00:47:37.556 --> 00:47:50.848
Either you lead a life which is luxurious on the material level,

00:47:50.973 --> 00:47:54.848
or you lead a luxurious life of God's blessings.

00:47:54.848 --> 00:47:57.722
One of the two you have to choose, the time has come.

00:47:58.180 --> 00:48:01.681
So nothing is important you see,

00:48:01.681 --> 00:48:05.056
the insecurity of money also is another nonsense.

00:48:05.056 --> 00:48:07.264
At least you people should not have it.

00:48:08.056 --> 00:48:10.681
I mean you will never starve at least,

00:48:10.722 --> 00:48:14.056
but Indians if they do not work they will starve.

00:48:16.389 --> 00:48:19.556
But you people can never starve, if you are unemployed,

00:48:19.556 --> 00:48:25.014
government is happy more, as long as you don't bother them.

00:48:25.889 --> 00:48:28.597
If you sit at home and meditate

00:48:28.639 --> 00:48:30.056
they'll be very happy.

00:48:31.098 --> 00:48:36.556
So to earn more money or to make more money

00:48:36.597 --> 00:48:38.764
is not important at all in Sahaja Yoga.

00:48:40.597 --> 00:48:43.681
Most important thing is to be the Spirit.

00:48:43.722 --> 00:48:45.931
For that whatever is to be done has to be done.

00:48:46.639 --> 00:48:52.430
Let everything suffer, you don't make your Spirit suffer.

00:48:55.014 --> 00:49:03.556
Because you have to become the full moon, like Guru Nanak.

00:49:04.222 --> 00:49:07.430
How much did Guru Nanak earn?

00:49:12.681 --> 00:49:19.973
You should find out, how did he live his life ?

00:49:25.764 --> 00:49:30.973
There is nothing to bother about money,

00:49:31.931 --> 00:49:35.014
because more money is not needed.

00:49:37.639 --> 00:49:42.138
Just needed for your food and your living.

00:49:43.639 --> 00:49:46.597
And then money is arranged if you need

00:49:46.597 --> 00:49:48.639
any extra money sometimes, emergencies.

00:49:48.681 --> 00:49:51.222
I've done it for many Australians, you know.

00:49:51.639 --> 00:49:55.681
But those are the people who have dedicated themselves fully.

00:49:57.848 --> 00:50:00.222
And that is why they have been helped,

00:50:00.264 --> 00:50:02.722
whenever there is an emergency they don't have to bother.

00:50:03.305 --> 00:50:08.180
But the dedication to your Spirit has to be full, complete,

00:50:08.806 --> 00:50:12.305
and nothing to your work, actually.

00:50:13.056 --> 00:50:15.722
Because that goes hand in hand.

00:50:16.556 --> 00:50:20.973
If you are not worried about yourself after realisation,

00:50:22.138 --> 00:50:26.222
about your Spirit, you'll have all the problems of the world.

00:50:26.806 --> 00:50:29.056
First and foremost is financial problems.

00:50:35.138 --> 00:50:44.138
Then, physical problem, mental problem, emotional problem.

00:50:44.806 --> 00:50:46.806
All kinds of problems will follow,

00:50:46.848 --> 00:50:50.848
because I've awakened your Kundalini; one part I've done.

00:50:51.806 --> 00:50:54.472
But another part that is your heart, you have not opened.

00:50:54.514 --> 00:50:56.806
You must give your heart to Sahaja Yoga.

00:50:57.347 --> 00:50:59.430
You have not opened your heart as yet.

00:51:00.139 --> 00:51:03.056
Heart has to be opened.

00:51:03.556 --> 00:51:06.014
You are still woried about your father, mother,

00:51:06.056 --> 00:51:07.889
brother, sister, wife, children.

00:51:08.597 --> 00:51:14.973
Open your heart fully to Sahaja Yoga.

00:51:15.556 --> 00:51:17.597
In a doubtless way.

00:51:18.139 --> 00:51:20.597
Then only doubt less awareness will settle down.

00:51:21.222 --> 00:51:23.973
Unless and until you open your heart,

00:51:24.139 --> 00:51:26.264
Kundalini rising has no meaning.

00:51:26.848 --> 00:51:31.347
Because the Kundalini is rising but the heart has not opened.

00:51:31.973 --> 00:51:36.056
If the Mother Earth sends forth her power through the seed

00:51:36.056 --> 00:51:39.138
and the seed doesn't open, then what's the use ?

00:51:39.138 --> 00:51:40.889
It's all a myth.

00:51:40.931 --> 00:51:43.138
Open your heart to Sahaja Yoga.

00:51:43.347 --> 00:51:46.056
Open your heart to Spirit, and say,

00:51:46.056 --> 00:51:48.014
"Mother we are the Spirit."

00:51:50.056 --> 00:51:51.639
You have to realize this,

00:51:51.681 --> 00:51:53.722
many people also perhaps do no realize

00:51:53.722 --> 00:51:57.514
that you have come on this earth to be the Spirit

00:51:57.973 --> 00:52:00.806
and not to be workers of human beings.

00:52:02.556 --> 00:52:08.347
You must understand your greatness and know

00:52:08.389 --> 00:52:12.389
that you are not like mundan people. That's why you are blessed.

00:52:13.014 --> 00:52:14.681
Who is blessed so much ?

00:52:15.264 --> 00:52:18.056
You are described long time back by Blake,

00:52:18.556 --> 00:52:21.347
that such and such people are going to come on this earth

00:52:21.389 --> 00:52:23.764
"men of God." Men of God.

00:52:25.305 --> 00:52:28.681
What do you have in your heart?

00:52:30.556 --> 00:52:33.931
Your heart will be like a stone.

00:52:34.430 --> 00:52:37.389
Unless and until there is light of the Spirit

00:52:37.389 --> 00:52:39.806
it is a stone heart,

00:52:39.848 --> 00:52:47.764
and this stone is going to hurt everyone, is going to ruin you completely.

00:52:48.222 --> 00:52:52.305
Open your heart hundred percent.

00:52:57.514 --> 00:52:59.973
You have met Indian Sahaja Yogis,

00:53:01.098 --> 00:53:02.681
they have problems of money.

00:53:03.681 --> 00:53:06.639
And how much they work for Sahaja Yoga,

00:53:07.098 --> 00:53:12.764
day in and day out how much they have contributed for Sahaja Yoga.

00:53:13.305 --> 00:53:18.138
You can imagine, about 7 lakhs of rupees they have collected,

00:53:18.138 --> 00:53:25.597
Rustom knows. 7 lakhs of rupees, they have collected for their ashram.

00:53:26.139 --> 00:53:35.264
7 lakhs is about £35000.£ 35000 they have collected only in Bombay.

00:53:35.556 --> 00:53:39.931
In Delhi they have collected about 5 lakhs, £ 25000.

00:53:42.848 --> 00:53:45.681
They are working, they have families they have children,

00:53:46.222 --> 00:53:49.806
but what they think about is nothing but Sahaja Yoga,

00:53:49.806 --> 00:53:51.848
nothing but Sahaja Yoga, nothing but Sahaja Yoga.

00:53:58.098 --> 00:54:01.722
They give most of their money for Sahaja Yoga, I think.

00:54:02.556 --> 00:54:04.305
They live with minimum.

00:54:04.848 --> 00:54:09.056
If I tell them why don't you buy another shirt for yourself,

00:54:09.722 --> 00:54:15.514
they will say, "Mother, I have worn lots of shirts in my previous life,"

00:54:18.138 --> 00:54:21.889
So satisfied ! "We have found the Atma now,

00:54:21.931 --> 00:54:24.264
let us dress up the Atma.

00:54:24.305 --> 00:54:28.430
We have found out our heart, let us become the heart".

00:54:28.472 --> 00:54:30.889
What is the need to worry about these things ?

00:54:30.931 --> 00:54:33.180
We have done enough of all this nonsense.

00:54:33.973 --> 00:54:38.430
I tell you they will think they are poor, but they are not.

00:54:39.848 --> 00:54:42.722
Wherever they can save their money they will save it.

00:54:43.222 --> 00:54:45.722
They used to give me some money before, I said,

00:54:45.764 --> 00:54:47.889
"No I don't need just now, there's no need"

00:54:47.889 --> 00:54:49.806
They said I have no place to keep;

00:54:49.848 --> 00:54:51.973
there is no trust, nothing, how are we to do it?

00:54:52.514 --> 00:55:02.472
They continued like this till about, I think, in, 74,

00:55:06.764 --> 00:55:10.222
when I went back we thought of starting an ashram,

00:55:10.264 --> 00:55:12.806
because you people were all coming there.

00:55:14.848 --> 00:55:20.556
So I said alright, now you have to give me money,

00:55:20.597 --> 00:55:23.722
all the Sahaja Yogis can give me money, whatever they have saved.

00:55:24.222 --> 00:55:27.264
And you'll be amazed everyone came out with 1000 rupees,

00:55:27.305 --> 00:55:32.472
every one of them, whether he was a labourer or every one of them,

00:55:32.514 --> 00:55:37.014
1000 rupees minimum. Up to 21 000.

00:55:37.764 --> 00:55:40.973
In 3 years time they had saved,

00:55:41.014 --> 00:55:42.889
because they thought it is our responsibility

00:55:42.931 --> 00:55:44.514
to save money for Sahaja Yoga.

00:55:44.556 --> 00:55:46.931
Tomorrow if we have to have an ashram how are we going to have ?

00:55:52.138 --> 00:55:54.889
But we still indulge into things.

00:56:02.681 --> 00:56:07.014
So this is what is the Gurupada.

00:56:07.056 --> 00:56:12.931
This Sir has to sit down, make an space for him.

00:56:12.973 --> 00:56:16.514
Come on, please. He doesn't need to be stand up. All right.

00:56:20.639 --> 00:56:24.305
So today is such a great day of Guru Nanaka's birthday,

00:56:25.264 --> 00:56:29.430
and we have to see his own life, how he spent his own life,

00:56:29.764 --> 00:56:35.931
how he lived and in what conditions he managed.

00:56:38.138 --> 00:56:42.973
So the first thing is to look after, disciplining yourself,

00:56:43.556 --> 00:56:47.222
feeling responsible for Sahaja Yoga.

00:56:48.056 --> 00:56:52.014
I was amazed people told, me that in the ashram

00:56:52.056 --> 00:56:57.138
people keep the lights on, and the oil costs so much,

00:56:57.139 --> 00:57:02.098
300 pounds every week. I'm amazed!

00:57:03.389 --> 00:57:07.639
Every one of you should be responsi-be for every electricity,

00:57:07.639 --> 00:57:11.347
everything that you spend here. This is God's place.

00:57:15.098 --> 00:57:19.264
Somebody has given the car, everybody wants to use the car.

00:57:19.305 --> 00:57:21.597
You see this saving the pounds

00:57:21.639 --> 00:57:24.056
is still going on the heads of Sahaja Yogis.

00:57:24.889 --> 00:57:28.056
If they can save by taking somebody's car they would borrow.

00:57:28.098 --> 00:57:29.514
Never borrow anybody's car.

00:57:29.514 --> 00:57:31.889
It's not for you, you must have your self respect,

00:57:31.889 --> 00:57:33.556
why to borrow anybody's car?

00:57:33.556 --> 00:57:35.931
It's not to be done.

00:57:39.138 --> 00:57:42.973
So the second point of the Self is self respect.

00:57:43.556 --> 00:57:46.722
First is the respect of your body,

00:57:47.264 --> 00:57:49.806
and the second is self-respect.

00:57:53.556 --> 00:57:57.764
We are arrogant, we can be rude,

00:57:59.597 --> 00:58:01.430
but we have no self respect.

00:58:10.556 --> 00:58:13.722
But it is the training that is lacking,

00:58:14.389 --> 00:58:16.722
you see suddenly I find after war

00:58:16.722 --> 00:58:22.931
there has been no teaching how to be self respecting.

00:58:25.138 --> 00:58:30.347
Like in the war, might be, the atmosphere might have been created I don't know why - that-

00:58:30.347 --> 00:58:33.056
"I´m above everything, don't care for others."

00:58:35.973 --> 00:58:39.138
May have been; I don't know why this kind of a thing has come,

00:58:39.138 --> 00:58:41.264
but it is so. Very prevalent.

00:58:41.305 --> 00:58:43.722
But you people have to be other way round:

00:58:44.222 --> 00:58:47.639
'Others are first and then yourself.

00:58:47.639 --> 00:58:49.264
With your self respect.

00:58:49.264 --> 00:58:52.597
Doesn't matter, nobody is going to die, I can tell you this much.

00:58:59.347 --> 00:59:04.305
You all must have self respect; and such mediocre people

00:59:04.764 --> 00:59:07.430
should not be allowed to stay in Sahaja Yoga,

00:59:10.138 --> 00:59:15.264
at least in the ashram, because it brings a bad name to all Sahaja Yoga.

00:59:15.264 --> 00:59:17.389
One person can spoil the whole.

00:59:17.889 --> 00:59:22.222
Only people who want to be Gurus have to stay in the ashram.

00:59:22.264 --> 00:59:25.056
It's not going to be made a convenience for anyone.

00:59:27.222 --> 00:59:31.138
But the other way around is that,

00:59:31.139 --> 00:59:33.764
"We are going to look after ourselves,

00:59:33.806 --> 00:59:36.889
we have to become this, we have to grow,

00:59:36.931 --> 00:59:38.597
we have to do it."

00:59:44.138 --> 00:59:48.098
Then it's just, the other way round, everything works out,

00:59:48.138 --> 00:59:49.973
I don't have to tell you.

00:59:50.014 --> 00:59:52.347
You know this is so base and so gross

00:59:52.806 --> 00:59:54.722
that after being here for so many years,

00:59:55.472 --> 01:00:00.138
you should all have become avadhutas by now, absolutely.

01:00:00.138 --> 01:00:02.639
Controlling all elements, everything, should have been possible;

01:00:03.180 --> 01:00:05.889
but stilI you are under the grip of the elements,

01:00:06.389 --> 01:00:08.305
how can you control it ?

01:00:15.264 --> 01:00:20.098
First of all get out of the slavery, this mental slavery.

01:00:22.014 --> 01:00:26.514
"Alright if it is there, it is there, if it is not there it doesn't matter.

01:00:26.556 --> 01:00:28.389
Nothing is more important than me,

01:00:28.806 --> 01:00:30.514
I am the king of the whole world.

01:00:30.556 --> 01:00:32.681
If I have to sleep on the ground I can sleep,

01:00:32.681 --> 01:00:34.639
if I have to sleep in the palaces I can sleep,

01:00:34.639 --> 01:00:38.514
nothing can dominate me." Then you are the master.

01:00:40.472 --> 01:00:42.806
You know in India, there are some Sahaja Yogis

01:00:42.848 --> 01:00:48.389
who are controlling definitely controlling, elements.

01:00:48.931 --> 01:00:52.347
We have examples of that, lots of things have been published

01:00:52.389 --> 01:00:55.138
you know in Nirmala Yoga, you must have heard.

01:00:55.848 --> 01:00:58.139
But you meet them, you'll find they are avadhutas

01:00:58.180 --> 01:01:00.764
and when they talk you feel a great sage is talking,

01:01:00.806 --> 01:01:03.430
and the way they behave, all the time you see their behaviour

01:01:03.472 --> 01:01:05.056
and everything is so great.

01:01:05.098 --> 01:01:06.764
We need people of that calibre today,

01:01:06.806 --> 01:01:09.472
because that is the situation of all nations.

01:01:12.806 --> 01:01:17.098
You have to be extra-good, because today is not a time

01:01:17.138 --> 01:01:20.264
when we can allow things to go, as they are.

01:01:24.556 --> 01:01:27.098
Or we are not just disciples,

01:01:27.098 --> 01:01:28.973
we all have to become gurus.

01:01:32.014 --> 01:01:36.347
And it is not the time when you can play with time.

01:01:36.347 --> 01:01:42.430
You cannot play with evil. You have to surmount it.

01:01:42.472 --> 01:01:44.264
You have to come on top of it, it is the time

01:01:44.305 --> 01:01:47.014
when the whole ship is going to be drowned or saved.

01:01:47.056 --> 01:01:48.722
This is the situation today.

01:01:49.305 --> 01:01:52.430
And that's why you have got your realization from God.

01:01:53.139 --> 01:01:55.264
If that precarious time had not arrived,

01:01:55.305 --> 01:01:58.305
how many of you really think you deserved it?

01:01:59.014 --> 01:02:04.681
But you got it, because the time is such that everybody

01:02:04.681 --> 01:02:08.305
must be given realization, and they must be given all powers

01:02:08.347 --> 01:02:10.139
so that they come up.

01:02:10.180 --> 01:02:12.056
But if you do not open your heart,

01:02:12.098 --> 01:02:14.430
put all your attention to your Spirit,

01:02:14.430 --> 01:02:16.639
these powers will not work out.

01:02:16.681 --> 01:02:18.681
None of these powers will work out in you.

01:02:19.514 --> 01:02:21.806
This is the problem.

01:02:21.806 --> 01:02:24.931
Every Guru had a command on the elements.

01:02:25.472 --> 01:02:27.848
Nanaka, you know definitely.

01:02:28.305 --> 01:02:34.305
People were sitting there and they asked him for the water

01:02:34.764 --> 01:02:40.472
and he put his hand on a rock and the water started pouring down.

01:02:41.889 --> 01:02:45.138
That's why it is called Punjab, Punja :

01:02:45.806 --> 01:02:50.597
five; and the five rivers exist there, too.

01:02:54.556 --> 01:02:59.139
It is said about all of them that they had powers over the elements.

01:03:01.889 --> 01:03:04.098
So how much we are lacking ?

01:03:04.098 --> 01:03:09.514
Still we are like other people who are selling cheap things,

01:03:10.180 --> 01:03:18.514
or who are busy making cheap things, or who are of no value.

01:03:19.222 --> 01:03:21.764
You are the ones who have to save the whole world.

01:03:23.681 --> 01:03:27.514
And the maximum of my life, blood and toil and everything,

01:03:27.556 --> 01:03:29.889
sweat, I've put in this land of yours.

01:03:30.430 --> 01:03:32.556
And the time is coming for me to go.

01:03:33.056 --> 01:03:38.722
Only three years more are left; before that,

01:03:38.764 --> 01:03:41.138
I hope, we establish an ashram.

01:03:41.180 --> 01:03:42.764
We need not pay for it,

01:03:42.764 --> 01:03:47.014
but, you have to be ready to occupy it,

01:03:47.014 --> 01:03:49.056
otherwise you cannot occupy it I can tell you,

01:03:49.056 --> 01:03:51.389
you cannot get any more blessings of God.

01:03:52.180 --> 01:03:54.180
So why should God bless you ?

01:03:54.180 --> 01:03:56.056
This is the point one should ask oneself.

01:03:56.098 --> 01:04:01.639
Are you your own Spirit or you are all else but the Spirit!

01:04:03.806 --> 01:04:08.848
But when I say something, it just goes as a big roaring,

01:04:09.639 --> 01:04:12.973
I don't know if the frequency has reached your ears or not,

01:04:13.014 --> 01:04:15.889
but I would request you now,

01:04:15.931 --> 01:04:19.514
as Gavin has asked me for Guru Nanaka's day,

01:04:19.514 --> 01:04:21.138
I really didn't want to come.

01:04:21.138 --> 01:04:24.389
Because to talk of Guru Nanaka and to hear about him,

01:04:26.347 --> 01:04:29.138
one has to be a very great person.

01:04:33.305 --> 01:04:38.180
Because such a light to bear, you have to make up yourself.

01:04:38.222 --> 01:04:40.973
Everything else is important,

01:04:44.389 --> 01:04:49.305
then how can you talk of Sahaja Yoga coming there.

01:04:52.931 --> 01:04:54.973
I went to America, I was surprised!

01:04:54.973 --> 01:04:56.848
Americans whatever it is, few people,

01:04:56.848 --> 01:04:59.305
but to them Sahaja Yoga is the most important thing.

01:04:59.347 --> 01:05:01.973
They talk of nothing but Sahaja Yoga, their life is Sahaja Yoga,

01:05:02.014 --> 01:05:04.722
morning till evening they are working out Sahaja Yoga,

01:05:04.764 --> 01:05:07.722
nothing else, they are not bothered.

01:05:07.722 --> 01:05:09.556
Australians you know.

01:05:15.014 --> 01:05:23.180
But the Heart is not open, the Spirit has not shown its light.

01:05:23.848 --> 01:05:31.931
It is the one that gives you complete satisfaction, complete joy,

01:05:32.848 --> 01:05:37.014
complete Guru's principle, because then you start giving.

01:05:37.056 --> 01:05:39.430
If there is no light what are you giving? Darkness ?

01:05:41.722 --> 01:05:43.556
What are you giving to others ?

01:05:44.305 --> 01:05:48.347
The darkness that is within you, if you are going to give that....

01:05:51.722 --> 01:06:03.098
So the second phase, has to be, as I have told you, to have self respect.

01:09:23.180 --> 01:09:27.848

01:09:51.264 --> 01:09:54.514

01:09:56.180 --> 01:10:01.098

01:10:01.098 --> 01:10:05.222

01:10:05.264 --> 01:10:11.556

01:10:11.597 --> 01:10:17.098

01:10:26.014 --> 01:10:30.931

01:11:07.556 --> 01:11:10.681

01:11:14.556 --> 01:11:19.222
-

01:11:20.138 --> 01:11:24.556
-

01:11:25.098 --> 01:11:30.848
-

01:11:30.848 --> 01:11:35.973
-

01:11:35.973 --> 01:11:40.722
-

01:11:40.764 --> 01:11:43.722
-

01:11:43.722 --> 01:11:45.848
-

01:11:45.889 --> 01:11:47.556
-

01:11:47.597 --> 01:11:51.180
-

01:11:51.222 --> 01:11:57.597
-

01:11:57.639 --> 01:12:00.514
-

01:12:00.556 --> 01:12:03.973
-

01:12:04.014 --> 01:12:08.848
-

01:12:08.848 --> 01:12:11.639
-

01:12:15.264 --> 01:12:18.848
-

01:12:18.848 --> 01:12:25.305
The one who out fishes and sells them in the market.

01:12:26.264 --> 01:12:29.722
But his body is so well built and shining

01:12:29.722 --> 01:12:32.681
and the muscles so developed and the man,

01:12:32.722 --> 01:12:34.764
he stands up and the way he talks!

01:12:34.764 --> 01:12:36.848
And absolutely humble person.

01:12:43.139 --> 01:12:45.722
No wonder Christ chose fishermen.

01:12:46.764 --> 01:12:51.014
While he has got thousands of fishermen as his disciples,

01:12:51.514 --> 01:12:53.722
but he doesn't call them disciples,

01:12:53.764 --> 01:12:55.098
he says they are all Mother's children.

01:12:55.639 --> 01:12:57.472
Thousands! You don't know.

01:12:57.514 --> 01:12:59.556
He has been calling me to go to them,

01:12:59.556 --> 01:13:01.764
and all that but they come to my programme, some of them.

01:13:03.098 --> 01:13:06.180
And one day I have to go down, to those islands,

01:13:06.180 --> 01:13:08.681
any one of the islands he said you come they will be all there

01:13:08.681 --> 01:13:10.514
the whole day waiting for you.

01:13:10.556 --> 01:13:15.014
But the way he is there is surprising.

01:13:17.347 --> 01:13:21.098
When I am there he brings fishes for me.

01:13:21.138 --> 01:13:25.430
But I said, you see, I eat fishes that you bring

01:13:25.472 --> 01:13:27.681
but what about my other children.

01:13:27.722 --> 01:13:31.722
He said no, next time, all the fishes will be sent to you.

01:13:31.764 --> 01:13:33.931
And he sent one truck-load to me, you would not believe!

01:13:34.514 --> 01:13:37.597
I said now I don't even have truck-load of disciples,

01:13:37.597 --> 01:13:39.430
who is going to eat all this?

01:13:42.472 --> 01:13:45.347
And he said, "Nothing, I just went and told fishermen

01:13:45.347 --> 01:13:48.180
that Mother has asked for fishes and everybody gave their fishes.

01:13:48.430 --> 01:13:50.014
One day they will not have fishes,

01:13:50.056 --> 01:13:52.138
what is there, what does it matter."

01:13:52.138 --> 01:13:55.848
Imagine those people who live day-to-day in that country.

01:13:58.848 --> 01:14:03.180
Modi told the newspaper people

01:14:03.222 --> 01:14:05.514
that we can control the elements

01:14:05.556 --> 01:14:07.264
somehow by Mother's grace.

01:14:07.305 --> 01:14:11.138
So the newspaper people felt they were very much boasting.

01:14:11.138 --> 01:14:14.389
But it is true, they can.

01:14:16.389 --> 01:14:20.056
To them it is not boasting it is just what it is they are seeing.

01:14:20.056 --> 01:14:23.139
They are telling the truth, you see.

01:14:23.180 --> 01:14:24.639
But that should happen.

01:14:24.681 --> 01:14:26.347
We should also have some things

01:14:26.389 --> 01:14:28.222
to boast here. Important.

01:14:28.222 --> 01:14:32.931
So now we have the other phase as I told you,

01:14:32.973 --> 01:14:42.973
is of becoming the Guru of yourself.

01:14:43.556 --> 01:14:47.681
Detaching yourself, identifying yourself with the Spirit

01:14:47.722 --> 01:14:49.597
which is growing in its light.

01:14:51.764 --> 01:14:55.514
So detachment. One has to develop detachment.

01:14:56.098 --> 01:14:58.389
'My' mother, it starts like that;

01:14:58.430 --> 01:15:04.389
my mother is suffering from cancer, my father is suffering from madness,

01:15:05.014 --> 01:15:06.848
Mother can you cure them ?

01:15:09.430 --> 01:15:11.931
So now first I cure mother and father.

01:15:12.430 --> 01:15:15.222
Then I'm married, my wife is like this,

01:15:15.264 --> 01:15:24.138
my child is like this then my house, then my motorcar,

01:15:24.430 --> 01:15:27.597
then my dog, then my umbrella!

01:15:30.973 --> 01:15:37.806
I have to go suddenly from A to Z, from Z to A.

01:15:40.430 --> 01:15:51.973
Alright, I can do, up to a point, but for what? For what?

01:15:52.556 --> 01:15:56.472
Why to cure the mother, father, brother, sisters,

01:15:56.472 --> 01:16:01.597
every relationship, the 10th marriage and the 11th divorce ?

01:16:02.138 --> 01:16:05.138
Why to correct all this? For what?

01:16:08.681 --> 01:16:14.347
It must have some purpose, and if that purpose cannot be served,

01:16:14.931 --> 01:16:17.722
what is the use of doing it?

01:16:18.472 --> 01:16:24.597
The purpose is that you at least leave all these things in my hands

01:16:25.138 --> 01:16:26.931
and detach yourself.

01:16:26.973 --> 01:16:30.056
But you want to bring the case to Me as well as worry about it.

01:16:31.180 --> 01:16:33.389
Detachment.

01:16:35.931 --> 01:16:39.014
But the idea of detachment is this!

01:16:39.014 --> 01:16:42.514
"I'm very detached about money, Mother, absolutely.

01:16:42.556 --> 01:16:45.222
I'm not bothered. I keep the lights on,

01:16:45.264 --> 01:16:46.889
why to worry about money ?"

01:16:49.138 --> 01:16:50.931
This is the argument,

01:16:50.931 --> 01:16:55.139
"Why should we worry about looking after the gas and all that,

01:16:55.180 --> 01:16:59.973
after all we are detached people. We are in detachment, you see.

01:17:00.848 --> 01:17:02.681
We are not attached to money."

01:17:02.848 --> 01:17:04.514
But who is going to pay ?

01:17:06.764 --> 01:17:11.597
The other type of detachment that. I see, very interesting one is this one:

01:17:12.180 --> 01:17:18.264
"I'm very detached, so I'm not bothered about having a bath,

01:17:20.806 --> 01:17:22.514
having all kinds of diseases,

01:17:22.931 --> 01:17:25.556
having all kinds of problems within myself,

01:17:25.639 --> 01:17:28.222
giving my problems to others. I'm detached!

01:17:28.681 --> 01:17:32.347
Why should I cover myself ? I'm detached.

01:17:32.764 --> 01:17:35.014
If I get cold, I'm detached,

01:17:35.347 --> 01:17:37.347
let everybody get cold from me.

01:17:38.722 --> 01:17:40.764
What can I do, I'm detached.

01:17:41.305 --> 01:17:43.764
I've got cold, so what does it matter,

01:17:43.764 --> 01:17:45.264
I'm a detached personality.

01:17:45.347 --> 01:17:46.681
Why should others mind?

01:17:46.681 --> 01:17:48.556
They should also get detached."

01:17:54.222 --> 01:17:57.180
This is the ridiculous limit we can go

01:17:57.222 --> 01:18:03.305
in our idea of detachment! Detachment is from within.

01:18:03.305 --> 01:18:12.098
You are not bothered. You are not bothered.

01:18:12.098 --> 01:18:14.305
You know your Mother.

01:18:15.138 --> 01:18:18.931
The first detachment is shown in generosity.

01:18:19.848 --> 01:18:30.056
Detachment is generosity. Grezna is.

01:18:30.472 --> 01:18:33.556
She sold her ornaments for nothing at all.

01:18:33.597 --> 01:18:35.514
I mean I would never have accepted that money,

01:18:35.556 --> 01:18:38.514
but she just sold them. It's remarkable.

01:18:39.056 --> 01:18:46.305
She sold them She is Polish not English. She sold her ornaments ;

01:18:46.347 --> 01:18:48.514
and this is what communism has done to people.

01:18:48.681 --> 01:18:50.180
They are very detached,

01:18:50.222 --> 01:18:52.639
communists are very detached people I tell you.

01:18:55.556 --> 01:19:00.764
Of course I would never take that money, that's theirs,

01:19:00.806 --> 01:19:03.806
but the way she did it, just like that.

01:19:03.806 --> 01:19:09.973
For God's work alright what is ornaments, take it.

01:19:10.014 --> 01:19:14.931
I mean you know I've given away so many of my ornaments

01:19:14.973 --> 01:19:16.931
to keep relations alright.

01:19:19.556 --> 01:19:22.681
The other day I gave away my Kara to Christine,

01:19:22.681 --> 01:19:24.639
you know that when she got engaged.

01:19:24.639 --> 01:19:26.806
Just it came out of the hand and went away.

01:19:26.848 --> 01:19:32.180
I was detached you see, I never even felt the coming out !

01:19:33.722 --> 01:19:35.347
So much detached that Christine told me

01:19:35.389 --> 01:19:40.098
she was cramped up with pressure but to me it was just, just nothing.

01:19:40.889 --> 01:19:51.597
Dust. So that detachment has to come.

01:19:51.639 --> 01:19:56.180
Now you should know which part you are there.

01:19:56.180 --> 01:20:01.806
Like idea of detachment should not be

01:20:01.848 --> 01:20:06.681
that - I would say hippy style of detachment,

01:20:06.722 --> 01:20:08.889
that you have right to exploit everybody else.

01:20:10.848 --> 01:20:13.889
And the other type as I told you. which is very ridiculous.

01:20:14.389 --> 01:20:17.430
It's not an idea, it's a thing,

01:20:17.430 --> 01:20:21.347
it's your awareness itself which is detached.

01:20:28.222 --> 01:20:34.222
So, these four things for your material side is important.

01:20:36.347 --> 01:20:41.973
What you eat is not so important,

01:20:42.014 --> 01:20:43.389
because whatever you eat,

01:20:43.430 --> 01:20:45.806
if the brain is going to be such a non-sensical thing

01:20:45.848 --> 01:20:49.264
it's better whether you eat it or not, makes no difference does it?

01:20:49.305 --> 01:20:53.098
Analyze it, like in the hotel, what will you have,

01:20:53.098 --> 01:20:55.098
" I'll have pancakes," what will you have,

01:20:55.098 --> 01:20:57.222
" I'll have this I'll have that", for what ?

01:20:57.764 --> 01:20:59.973
I just don't understand why waste so much energy,

01:21:00.014 --> 01:21:02.639
why not you all have pancakes all of you put together.

01:21:03.889 --> 01:21:08.472
It's a very big thing you know. Or, today I'll have this.

01:21:08.472 --> 01:21:15.514
"I". Out of all this materialism what comes out is Mr "I".

01:21:17.639 --> 01:21:20.014
So we develop this Mr I.

01:21:20.639 --> 01:21:25.014
So the word "I" must go away, we should speak "we".

01:21:26.764 --> 01:21:32.264
"We" means you and all the Sahaja Yogis put together.

01:21:34.056 --> 01:21:38.014
When you say "we" you will find it will be different.

01:21:38.014 --> 01:21:41.430
Or take your name, like "this Norman."

01:21:42.472 --> 01:21:47.222
"This Norman won't listen," like children say.

01:21:47.264 --> 01:21:50.889
I asked a little boy, will you go home ? "

01:21:51.389 --> 01:21:58.597
I will go, but this (his name was Munna) this Munna, won't go,

01:21:58.639 --> 01:22:09.056
he's very obstinate, what can I do ?" This is detachment.

01:22:09.639 --> 01:22:12.098
To speak in third person is detachment,

01:22:12.098 --> 01:22:17.597
in which you are not in the picture...

01:22:17.639 --> 01:22:19.222
you are a witness.

01:22:19.264 --> 01:22:20.430
You are the witness in the show.

01:22:20.472 --> 01:22:24.264
So this detachment should work in such a way

01:22:24.305 --> 01:22:26.264
that you should witness the whole show,

01:22:26.264 --> 01:22:27.806
you're not involved into it.

01:22:27.848 --> 01:22:32.556
But just see what happens, in collectivity also.

01:22:34.138 --> 01:22:36.889
It becomes a political issue certainly,

01:22:36.931 --> 01:22:41.056
in Sahaja Yoga also, political issue; nothing short of political issue!

01:22:41.597 --> 01:22:48.430
We are not here fighting like union leaders.

01:22:49.139 --> 01:22:53.514
We are all leaders ! Where is the time to fight?

01:22:58.639 --> 01:23:02.098
Whom are we to fight , that we have to decide.

01:23:02.681 --> 01:23:06.514
So, as far as all these things concerned,

01:23:06.514 --> 01:23:10.639
are detachment and attachment to Spirit.

01:23:13.430 --> 01:23:15.180
So we go further,

01:23:15.222 --> 01:23:19.556
see now what should be our attitude on our mental level.

01:23:21.305 --> 01:23:27.098
Physically you have seen that you have to develop

01:23:27.098 --> 01:23:31.305
a complete detachment in these four ways that I have told you.

01:23:31.931 --> 01:23:35.556
Now on your mental level what you have to do,

01:23:36.305 --> 01:23:46.764
is to understand the essence of every writing,

01:23:47.264 --> 01:23:52.098
try to discriminate between Vidya and avidya.

01:23:52.264 --> 01:24:00.681
Because avidya will kill you, will take away your energy,

01:24:01.264 --> 01:24:04.305
but vidya will sustain.

01:24:04.889 --> 01:24:10.430
So try to find out books which are supporting vidya.

01:24:10.889 --> 01:24:13.848
I was surprised, there is a lady Barbara,

01:24:13.848 --> 01:24:15.889
she met only last time Gavin,

01:24:15.889 --> 01:24:19.514
and she has written such a tremendous book, you'd be amazed!

01:24:20.931 --> 01:24:24.681
I mean of such a level on Sahaja Yoga ! Very direct.

01:24:24.722 --> 01:24:29.222
I'll show you that, and you know that book is now being considered

01:24:29.264 --> 01:24:32.514
for giving her a.doctorate, can you believe it I

01:24:32.514 --> 01:24:34.430
In an American university;

01:24:34.472 --> 01:24:36.056
of course that's only possible in America.

01:24:36.098 --> 01:24:42.098
But still that book has that level,

01:24:42.098 --> 01:24:44.014
I was amazed at the book!

01:24:44.056 --> 01:24:50.597
So try to gather nourishment, like reading Devi Mahatmya,

01:24:50.639 --> 01:24:53.138
reading about, finding out about Bible

01:24:53.139 --> 01:24:57.389
and finding about other scriptures, about Koran - this that,

01:24:57.430 --> 01:25:00.848
and which supports you, which nourishes you.

01:25:02.264 --> 01:25:10.764
Blake, Kabir, Nanaka. I mean there are so many, Laotze.

01:25:11.639 --> 01:25:15.889
This is the good - is the knowledge. But you'll be amazed,

01:25:15.889 --> 01:25:18.430
once you start doing it, it comes to you.

01:25:18.430 --> 01:25:25.347
I met a man near Rahuri - as you know we go there,

01:25:28.138 --> 01:25:31.889
and there's a man who just drives a bullock cart,

01:25:32.681 --> 01:25:36.722
and he had brought the bullock cart to take me down

01:25:37.180 --> 01:25:39.848
to one of the programmes, you know what we do there.

01:25:39.848 --> 01:25:43.138
And he was sitting there, we were waiting, I was talking, to him.

01:25:43.138 --> 01:25:46.056
And I felt an Avadhuta is sitting there to drive me,

01:25:46.056 --> 01:25:49.639
I mean uneducated absolutely, he's never known books,

01:25:49.681 --> 01:25:52.180
he does not know how to write, but the way he was talking I said,

01:25:52.222 --> 01:25:55.305
"Oh God, from where this knowledge!

01:26:00.389 --> 01:26:03.098
From where was all this coming, this wisdom!

01:26:03.138 --> 01:26:04.848
Such wisdom, I tell you!''

01:26:05.514 --> 01:26:09.305
Such wisdom that I was just stunned, I was stunned really!

01:26:09.347 --> 01:26:13.597
From a man who is not even been to any school-college.

01:26:13.639 --> 01:26:15.931
Christ did not go to any school or college.

01:26:17.973 --> 01:26:20.014
Such wisdom, you can't imagine.

01:26:20.056 --> 01:26:22.180
You meet him next time when you go there.

01:26:22.806 --> 01:26:27.889
If somebody could translate him... you feel like touching his feet

01:26:27.889 --> 01:26:30.639
the way - extremely unassuming simple man,

01:26:30.639 --> 01:26:37.931
wearing a white, clean topi and clean dress and driving me down.

01:26:38.139 --> 01:26:41.597
And to him this was the greatest privilege of the whole world --

01:26:41.639 --> 01:26:44.931
is to drive me; he said "It must be the greatest of all --

01:26:44.973 --> 01:26:47.597
something I must have done - to be able to drive you."

01:26:48.139 --> 01:26:52.014
And in such simple ways he was explaining to me

01:26:52.014 --> 01:26:55.098
about the character of the bullocks and the human beings --

01:26:55.681 --> 01:26:59.681
just imagine! And the things he talked about,

01:26:59.722 --> 01:27:02.430
if I tell you, you won't believe - so I just don't know...

01:27:03.305 --> 01:27:09.681
That's the sign of a great man, he doesn't talk of frivolous things,

01:27:09.681 --> 01:27:11.764
he has no time to talk about frivolous things.

01:27:11.764 --> 01:27:13.347
I have seen my own grandchildren --

01:27:13.389 --> 01:27:15.514
they never talk of frivolous things, they have no time,

01:27:15.514 --> 01:27:17.056
they are busy, you know.

01:27:17.056 --> 01:27:19.639
All the time clearing out, when they came here, they said

01:27:19.639 --> 01:27:21.305
"We have to clear out this Brompton Square,

01:27:21.347 --> 01:27:23.430
then we have to clear out this Knights bridge,

01:27:23.430 --> 01:27:25.056
then we have to clear out this London,

01:27:25.098 --> 01:27:26.848
then we have to clear out this England.

01:27:26.889 --> 01:27:28.389
Where is the map of England, bring it,"

01:27:28.389 --> 01:27:31.014
all the time they were busy, you see, clearing out, and then,

01:27:31.056 --> 01:27:32.514
"this place is this, this place is this.

01:27:32.514 --> 01:27:34.347
Oh God this horrible,

01:27:34.347 --> 01:27:36.098
bring some shoes, do this do that,"

01:27:36.098 --> 01:27:38.639
all the time they were busy morning till evening.

01:27:38.681 --> 01:27:41.597
They would go upstairs in the room and they are busy.

01:27:41.639 --> 01:27:43.389
They are busy people, they have no time to talk

01:27:43.430 --> 01:27:44.973
of the mundane things and all that.

01:27:44.973 --> 01:27:47.098
Then I brought some dolls and toys, for them.

01:27:47.138 --> 01:27:51.180
They put all of them there and they put them, and the map there,

01:27:51.180 --> 01:27:55.138
"now see now, (to dolls) now you look after, alright ?"

01:27:55.180 --> 01:27:58.597
You know they're talking to dolls like that.

01:27:58.639 --> 01:28:00.556
Dolls are their disciples. Teaching the dolls,

01:28:00.597 --> 01:28:04.347
"you see, don't sit like this, you must sit properly, you don't know.

01:28:04.347 --> 01:28:05.931
You can't bend your knees ?

01:28:05.973 --> 01:28:07.973
Better learn that, you must learn to bend your knees,"

01:28:08.014 --> 01:28:10.597
because dolls have straight legs!

01:28:15.430 --> 01:28:18.681
And all the boys, even the little children,

01:28:18.722 --> 01:28:21.764
I have seen the way they are busy all the time doing Sahaja Yoga.

01:28:24.264 --> 01:28:28.305
Every level they are working.

01:28:29.556 --> 01:28:35.222
As today I was telling Rustom about my own father.

01:28:36.056 --> 01:28:38.014
You see, he was a learned man, of course.

01:28:38.014 --> 01:28:42.931
But when he talked, he used to talk of something,

01:28:42.931 --> 01:28:47.931
like I told him about the state of a person, called Sambhranta.

01:28:48.514 --> 01:28:53.014
He told me that, "Human beings are very different from God.

01:28:53.514 --> 01:28:57.180
When God incarnates then the Sambhranta state,

01:28:57.222 --> 01:28:59.973
which is awakening between the subconscious

01:29:00.014 --> 01:29:05.931
to the conscious state, is direct, you see.

01:29:05.931 --> 01:29:08.139
He comes down directly But human beings

01:29:08.180 --> 01:29:12.889
go this way, they never go straight.

01:29:13.389 --> 01:29:15.931
See God descends, so he descends properly,

01:29:15.973 --> 01:29:18.889
but ascent is always in a very separate way.

01:29:18.931 --> 01:29:21.556
It goes on like this, and he gathers everything

01:29:21.597 --> 01:29:25.347
that is in his subconscious, so the Sambhranta state,

01:29:25.389 --> 01:29:28.681
where he is waking up, is such a dangerous thing

01:29:28.681 --> 01:29:30.222
that he can gather up anything.

01:29:30.264 --> 01:29:33.889
And by the time he gathers up the dreams he becomes something so funny.

01:29:33.973 --> 01:29:38.848
He may look at God whom he has seen in his dream

01:29:38.889 --> 01:29:42.180
like a witch, and the witch like a bird."

01:29:42.806 --> 01:29:51.472
I saw him always busy. I mean to talk to him,

01:29:51.472 --> 01:29:55.722
I found a companion and he found me a companion sort of a thing.

01:29:55.764 --> 01:29:58.098
He could talk, because his attention was there.

01:29:58.098 --> 01:30:01.014
His attention was not how every body has made their hair,

01:30:01.014 --> 01:30:04.514
and how they are sitting down or what dresses they are making,

01:30:04.556 --> 01:30:06.681
or what do you have in this thing - nothing.

01:30:06.722 --> 01:30:12.514
His attention was on the Spirit, his own Spirit and Spirit of others.

01:30:12.556 --> 01:30:20.180
And he was so dynamic in his brain that he knew your dictionary

01:30:20.180 --> 01:30:21.430
by heart, I tell you.

01:30:21.430 --> 01:30:23.639
He never consulted dictionary all his life --

01:30:23.639 --> 01:30:27.639
neither Sanskrit nor English, and he was master of 14 languages.

01:30:27.639 --> 01:30:33.764
Can you imagine! How he must have managed!

01:30:33.806 --> 01:30:37.389
He used to play tennis very well, he used to swim for 3 miles every day.

01:30:37.389 --> 01:30:40.931
3 miles. He had muscles that he could just lift you up. Yes!

01:30:43.889 --> 01:30:48.430
Very healthy personality, healthy man.

01:30:48.472 --> 01:30:50.931
Very generous, very generous.

01:30:50.973 --> 01:30:53.389
Much more generous than me, so you can imagine.

01:30:53.430 --> 01:30:55.931
Very generous, to him nothing mattered,

01:30:55.973 --> 01:30:57.639
"alright you like it, take it".

01:30:57.639 --> 01:31:01.222
He'll starve himself but he'll be generous.

01:31:01.264 --> 01:31:05.139
And a man of principle.

01:31:05.180 --> 01:31:10.764
So we come to the second point which is actually

01:31:10.806 --> 01:31:13.556
we have started the fifth one - which is mentally

01:31:13.597 --> 01:31:18.222
you must only take to things which are nourishing.

01:31:22.347 --> 01:31:24.222
Through vibratory awareness you will know.

01:31:24.222 --> 01:31:28.430
Ask other Sahaja Yogis, if you do not know.

01:31:28.848 --> 01:31:31.430
But take nourishing things to read and not horrible,

01:31:31.472 --> 01:31:33.722
detrimental to your growth.

01:31:33.764 --> 01:31:36.305
If you read them, you are responsible:

01:31:36.347 --> 01:31:41.180
You are real great readers I must say --

01:31:41.222 --> 01:31:43.514
you ask any name, everyone knows.

01:31:43.556 --> 01:31:45.347
I said who was Gropius, everyone knows.

01:31:45.389 --> 01:31:47.222
You need not be an academician to tell.

01:31:47.222 --> 01:31:50.889
Everyone knows, what happened, who is this, who is that.

01:31:50.889 --> 01:31:53.973
Out of your seeking you have done one good thing --

01:31:54.014 --> 01:31:56.430
to have read everything whether good or bad,

01:31:56.430 --> 01:31:58.305
whatever it is.

01:31:58.347 --> 01:32:00.639
But now after realisation, you must try to find out

01:32:00.639 --> 01:32:03.138
what you have to read, what you have to know,

01:32:03.138 --> 01:32:04.889
it should be nourishing.

01:32:04.889 --> 01:32:08.848
Talk that is nourishing, helpful.

01:32:08.889 --> 01:32:14.472
So in talk you should have compassion.

01:32:14.472 --> 01:32:19.222
If you are talking to someone you should be full of compassion.

01:32:19.264 --> 01:32:21.430
Sahaja Yoga is a system of compassion.

01:32:21.430 --> 01:32:26.098
A Guru has to be very-very patient.

01:32:26.138 --> 01:32:29.347
It is not like other Gurudom,

01:32:29.764 --> 01:32:32.597
or even real Gurus had no patience.

01:32:33.472 --> 01:32:38.806
This is a system where patience is the only way it will work out,

01:32:38.848 --> 01:32:41.014
because no Gurus gave realisation, it is only you

01:32:41.014 --> 01:32:43.472
who have to give it. And you know what is realisation.

01:32:43.514 --> 01:32:48.138
The other day we met one; the fellow sitting tight.

01:32:48.139 --> 01:32:56.056
They said, "We have failed Mother, we can't give him realisation,

01:32:56.098 --> 01:32:57.806
it's a hopeless case". I said, "Really ?"

01:32:57.806 --> 01:33:00.889
So I went there - at the end of it you see, they said,

01:33:00.931 --> 01:33:02.347
"Mother there's one fellow sitting".

01:33:02.389 --> 01:33:05.430
I wanted to aviod, you see, but they said.

01:33:05.472 --> 01:33:11.722
Alright, so raised his Kundalini, raised it up, tied it up,

01:33:11.764 --> 01:33:16.931
my hands bearing now. "Oh no, I didn't feel anything".

01:33:16.973 --> 01:33:23.931
I said, this fellow is least bothered

01:33:23.973 --> 01:33:26.138
how much we are working on him!

01:33:26.139 --> 01:33:28.138
He's just thinking he's obliging us."

01:33:28.138 --> 01:33:31.556
So then two or three people came forward, brought a light,

01:33:31.556 --> 01:33:35.014
put the light before him, did bandhan here and everything:

01:33:35.056 --> 01:33:38.973
Again I raised his Kundalini thrice:

01:33:39.014 --> 01:33:44.889
"No, not at all... ! "it went on like that for half an hour,

01:33:44.889 --> 01:33:46.222
then I gave up. I said,

01:33:46.264 --> 01:33:48.014
"Sir, I'm sorry, you are too great

01:33:48.014 --> 01:33:52.347
for realisation! We'll try again".

01:33:52.347 --> 01:33:58.639
"I'm not convinced..." And I was fagged out,

01:33:58.681 --> 01:34:02.139
I said "Really, I am convinced about you,

01:34:02.180 --> 01:34:04.764
so, you allow us to go", and then I came out.

01:34:04.806 --> 01:34:07.889
You have to have 'tremendous' patience and sense of humour --

01:34:07.931 --> 01:34:09.806
you just can't tell him off.

01:34:09.848 --> 01:34:12.222
You see if I told him ''You are good for nothing, useless,

01:34:12.222 --> 01:34:16.806
you have a bad Kundalini you go away from here get away, get lost."

01:34:16.806 --> 01:34:23.556
I couldn't say these things to him, I had to bear him through and not only,

01:34:23.556 --> 01:34:26.764
in the end I had to say you are a great man, you see.

01:34:26.806 --> 01:34:29.889
Because otherwise he would have used some other method.

01:34:29.889 --> 01:34:32.597
Because, already the ego was so big

01:34:32.597 --> 01:34:35.889
that with all the pins I put inside it, it could not deflate,

01:34:35.889 --> 01:34:38.722
it was made of a special fibre I think !

01:34:42.639 --> 01:34:45.014
It was such a difficult task.

01:34:45.056 --> 01:34:48.347
So one has to know that we have to be compassionate.

01:34:48.389 --> 01:34:53.014
We have to read something that nourishes our compassion.

01:34:53.056 --> 01:34:58.138
Read of people who gave away everything that they had.

01:34:58.139 --> 01:35:04.597
Tukarama. Read Tukarama. Tukarama was a poor man.

01:35:04.639 --> 01:35:09.389
And one day he went to some place and did some good job,

01:35:09.430 --> 01:35:14.973
so they gave him lots of sugar cane.

01:35:15.347 --> 01:35:17.889
His children were very fond of sugar cane.

01:35:18.931 --> 01:35:21.931
So on the way every child would ask, "give me one sugar cane".

01:35:21.973 --> 01:35:23.389
He was giving to everyone.

01:35:23.389 --> 01:35:25.180
When he came home only one was left.

01:35:25.222 --> 01:35:27.722
So the children said, "we are three".

01:35:27.722 --> 01:35:31.014
He said, "It's alright; next time I will bring for you,

01:35:31.056 --> 01:35:34.889
share it among you three". And they had it,

01:35:34.931 --> 01:35:37.764
they said, "better have it, now one more child will come

01:35:37.764 --> 01:35:39.389
and this will also go away".

01:35:41.931 --> 01:35:45.806
So one has to know about lives who have been giving.

01:35:47.264 --> 01:35:50.347
Read about people who have been giving.

01:35:51.014 --> 01:35:57.056
They gave their lives. They crucified them, they tortured them.

01:35:57.098 --> 01:35:59.264
They allowed to be exploited.

01:35:59.305 --> 01:36:01.347
They allowed to be poisoned.

01:36:01.347 --> 01:36:05.514
Head of such sacrifice, of great sacrifices.

01:36:05.556 --> 01:36:08.722
We are lucky people that we have seen all those things

01:36:08.764 --> 01:36:10.264
with our own eyes.

01:36:10.264 --> 01:36:13.722
But at least you be one of them, that you can at least,

01:36:13.764 --> 01:36:19.264
if not see, visualise it. You can. Bring that as your principle.

01:36:19.305 --> 01:36:25.556
So we move now, from detachment,

01:36:25.597 --> 01:36:29.472
which I've told you four types of detachment,

01:36:29.514 --> 01:36:35.389
and then I told you the nourishment of your mind

01:36:36.138 --> 01:36:38.848
and nourishment to your heart.

01:36:39.305 --> 01:36:46.014
Nothing nourishes more to a person than giving away.

01:36:46.514 --> 01:36:51.389
Nothing nourishes your heart, your compassion,

01:36:51.430 --> 01:36:53.597
unless and until you learn to give away.

01:36:53.764 --> 01:36:56.014
Now will you please make a list of things,

01:36:56.014 --> 01:37:02.056
"how many things you have given away in this one year, last one year".

01:37:02.098 --> 01:37:03.806
I can't because it is too much.

01:37:06.556 --> 01:37:10.639
Please make a list of things, "how many things",

01:37:10.681 --> 01:37:15.056
except for your brains you have given away to others

01:37:15.681 --> 01:37:21.472
without thinking about it, or have thought of giving.

01:37:25.639 --> 01:37:29.597
Since Christmas let us say, to this Christmas.

01:37:34.806 --> 01:37:42.806
Heart is opening. Think of giving.

01:37:44.264 --> 01:37:50.430
On material level, other help is there to give.

01:37:50.472 --> 01:37:55.514
But no, we don't even give the other help,

01:37:55.931 --> 01:37:58.389
for which you don't have to spend any money.

01:37:58.430 --> 01:38:00.056
Just give a hand.

01:38:00.722 --> 01:38:04.848
I have seen, very easy to make out,

01:38:05.430 --> 01:38:07.597
labour saving devices.

01:38:09.639 --> 01:38:13.681
Now, I have come here, some will be running,

01:38:13.722 --> 01:38:15.556
others are just sitting.

01:38:15.556 --> 01:38:19.138
Tea is brought to them, food is brought of them everything is done.

01:38:19.139 --> 01:38:22.556
They'll just put the plate also before: go and wash.

01:38:28.639 --> 01:38:35.138
Its not only selfishness but it is unmannerly, unmannerly to be like this.

01:38:38.973 --> 01:38:45.347
In Sahaja Yoga you have to be

01:38:45.347 --> 01:38:50.139
extremely busy helping others,

01:38:50.931 --> 01:38:54.180
at every point. To be helpful.

01:38:55.138 --> 01:38:58.764
You know Ravi Shankar's Guru was a very great,

01:38:59.764 --> 01:39:04.806
a very great man, a realized soul. He was a great person.

01:39:04.806 --> 01:39:06.305
So he knew so many things.

01:39:06.889 --> 01:39:12.139
And one day I was there, in the night you see, there was a doctor,

01:39:12.180 --> 01:39:16.806
we were his guests in a way, for dinner we had gone there.

01:39:17.138 --> 01:39:18.848
In the night the call came that,

01:39:18.889 --> 01:39:21.138
"I need you very much" to the doctor.

01:39:21.138 --> 01:39:22.639
The doctor said, "Now I'm tired".

01:39:22.639 --> 01:39:24.973
He was another very giving person, no doubt.

01:39:24.973 --> 01:39:27.222
He said, "Oh you must come, I have a big problem.

01:39:27.222 --> 01:39:31.056
See I saw a little baby."

01:39:31.098 --> 01:39:33.764
He said, "What baby have you found ?"

01:39:33.806 --> 01:39:36.056
He said, "its a baby," he was an old man,

01:39:36.098 --> 01:39:41.722
he said, "I found a baby of a deer which is suffering now,

01:39:41.722 --> 01:39:45.098
and the mother is dead and nobody is to look after it."

01:39:45.098 --> 01:39:49.139
So I said "Alright I'll also come with you",

01:39:49.180 --> 01:39:52.472
because I knew I will touch the baby. I went with him.

01:39:52.514 --> 01:40:00.305
So, he was sitting with the little thing near his heart.

01:40:00.347 --> 01:40:03.389
So the doctor said, "What are you doing ?"

01:40:03.430 --> 01:40:07.014
He said, "I'm trying to give him my life if possible,

01:40:07.014 --> 01:40:10.556
so that when you come at least you find him alive".

01:40:10.597 --> 01:40:12.931
Just like this, just love.

01:40:12.931 --> 01:40:18.222
So he took out the thing - doctor - his coat and all that,

01:40:18.264 --> 01:40:20.264
and he said, "alright put it down".

01:40:20.305 --> 01:40:22.472
He put it down very cautiously.

01:40:22.514 --> 01:40:24.222
I mean he was a realized soul, no doubt.

01:40:24.222 --> 01:40:28.305
I put my hand on the thing and it came to life,

01:40:28.347 --> 01:40:30.931
and it started, alright, he was very happy.

01:40:30.973 --> 01:40:35.472
He said, "You are a Devi, you are a Goddess, I can tell you.

01:40:35.514 --> 01:40:37.556
But one bad thing you have done." I said "What ? "

01:40:37.597 --> 01:40:41.098
You are married." I said, "But Devis must marry, also."

01:40:41.138 --> 01:40:44.014
He said, "No, supposing you have married a miserly man,

01:40:44.014 --> 01:40:45.556
then what will happen to you ?"

01:40:45.597 --> 01:40:48.347
I said, "I will see to it that, I don't marry a miserly man.

01:40:50.389 --> 01:40:53.514
That would be the greatest curse."

01:40:53.556 --> 01:40:56.056
He said, "I had the same type of a wife who was miserly,

01:40:56.098 --> 01:40:58.764
and I got fed up with her for her miserliness."

01:40:59.722 --> 01:41:03.264
So that is what it is : miserliness should be hated,

01:41:03.305 --> 01:41:09.806
absolutely to be hated, absolutely to be the worst of all.

01:41:09.806 --> 01:41:13.264
It's like leprosy for Sahaja Yogis. Miserliness.

01:41:13.264 --> 01:41:15.514
It's saving saving pounds, you know.

01:41:18.430 --> 01:41:20.848
That must go away from your mind,

01:41:23.180 --> 01:41:28.764
Miserliness to yourself is good, miserliness to others is bad.

01:41:28.806 --> 01:41:31.264
Gregoire told me a shocking thing.

01:41:31.305 --> 01:41:33.138
He said, "this is our culture."

01:41:33.139 --> 01:41:35.138
I said "Your culture ! what is it ?"

01:41:35.597 --> 01:41:39.222
You see, he said that "if we go in a hotel, and if somebody is paying,

01:41:39.264 --> 01:41:41.014
we start looking this side and that."

01:41:41.056 --> 01:41:43.931
I said, "Really !". He said, that is very common.

01:41:49.514 --> 01:41:51.681
I just cannot believe it ! This is culture!

01:41:51.722 --> 01:41:54.722
It is the opposite of culture. Whatever you may call it,

01:41:54.764 --> 01:41:58.139
it's not culture at all. Culture would be to come forward,

01:41:58.180 --> 01:42:01.931
"Alright I'll pay". But Americans are even worse, they'll say,

01:42:01.973 --> 01:42:04.597
"I paid for you yesterday, you pay today for me."

01:42:06.848 --> 01:42:10.222
It's absolutely disgraceful miserliness.

01:42:10.973 --> 01:42:14.472
But this is gracious; you see when somebody is paying,

01:42:14.472 --> 01:42:17.264
you look on the other side. It may be gracious, I don't know,

01:42:18.681 --> 01:42:23.180
whatever it is, it's just the same ; filth I tell you.

01:42:23.222 --> 01:42:26.389
So compassion ; compassion at any point.

01:42:26.389 --> 01:42:28.806
You may have to work till 2 o'clock, you may .

01:42:28.848 --> 01:42:30.722
have to work at 4 o'clock, doesn't matter.

01:42:30.764 --> 01:42:32.806
You have to work, you have to work, you have to work;

01:42:32.848 --> 01:42:36.098
because compassion itself is joy giving,

01:42:36.098 --> 01:42:41.222
because your Spirit is the Ocean of Compassion.

01:42:41.222 --> 01:42:47.848
There is no other way, there is no other way

01:42:47.848 --> 01:42:52.138
to enjoy your Spirit but to Give, to Give, to Give.

01:42:52.139 --> 01:42:54.681
Doesn't matter if you have not eaten your food, doesn't matter.

01:42:54.722 --> 01:42:58.056
Nothing matters.

01:42:59.556 --> 01:43:05.098
Many a times a you know that I don't have food for 24 hours sometimes,

01:43:05.138 --> 01:43:06.889
still I am giving.

01:43:06.931 --> 01:43:09.681
Its not necessary for this body to eat,

01:43:09.722 --> 01:43:14.222
the food of this body is compassion. That nourishes.

01:43:16.472 --> 01:43:19.347
So you have to be miserly towards yourself,

01:43:19.389 --> 01:43:21.222
but you must have compassion.

01:43:22.764 --> 01:43:25.389
Heart, open your heart.

01:43:26.138 --> 01:43:30.681
Open your heart first of all, for thankfulness.

01:43:34.806 --> 01:43:38.597
This is the other quality one should have.

01:43:38.639 --> 01:43:42.514
It's a higher quality I should say, of thankfulness to God.

01:43:42.556 --> 01:43:45.597
He has given you realization. He has given you this body.

01:43:45.639 --> 01:43:47.681
Do you realize that this body,

01:43:47.722 --> 01:43:49.389
human body He has given to you.

01:43:49.556 --> 01:43:51.931
He has given you everything. Count your blessings.

01:43:52.973 --> 01:43:56.889
Even to have the morning, to enjoy it as a human being.

01:43:58.138 --> 01:44:01.931
You are not in any bandhan, you are not in any pasha,

01:44:01.973 --> 01:44:04.222
you are not pashus, you are not animals.

01:44:04.264 --> 01:44:05.889
Animals are pashus.

01:44:05.889 --> 01:44:08.139
You are free people, God has given you freedom.

01:44:09.098 --> 01:44:15.472
And he has given you His realization. Sense of thankfulness.

01:44:15.472 --> 01:44:19.014
But our language is such, "thank you, thank you, thank you," finished.

01:44:19.056 --> 01:44:22.639
It is only in the lips, it finishes; lipservice.

01:44:23.305 --> 01:44:30.056
From your heart thank Him, from your heart.

01:44:30.098 --> 01:44:34.472
Not outside just go to church, "thank you. God very much,"

01:44:34.514 --> 01:44:36.764
alright done, finished.

01:44:40.098 --> 01:44:51.098
It's to thank Him from your heart, write praise. Praise.

01:44:51.138 --> 01:45:00.222
Sing praise, "glory to God." to the great who has created us.

01:45:00.889 --> 01:45:04.472
Your disciples are sitting and every moment

01:45:04.472 --> 01:45:08.347
when you are talking you are thinking about Mother or about God.

01:45:08.389 --> 01:45:16.389
You'll be amazed! It's only possible if you have sensitivity,

01:45:17.848 --> 01:45:26.305
if you have memory. The greatest miracle of this world

01:45:26.347 --> 01:45:30.639
is that everybody has to die and nobody remembers it.

01:45:31.472 --> 01:45:35.138
But another one, is that everybody is blessed by God

01:45:35.138 --> 01:45:37.139
but nobody knows it.

01:45:37.180 --> 01:45:41.722
But you are so specially blessed.

01:45:47.014 --> 01:45:49.973
So what you should do ?

01:45:51.139 --> 01:45:59.014
Be in joy, be grateful, so that bliss comes to you.

01:46:00.764 --> 01:46:04.472
Without thankfulness nothing is going to work out.

01:46:04.514 --> 01:46:07.556
Thankful heart.

01:46:07.597 --> 01:46:12.514
You need a heart that is thankful to God so that he gives you.

01:46:12.556 --> 01:46:15.639
When you give others he will definitely give.

01:46:15.681 --> 01:46:17.889
But don't think it is your own.

01:46:20.722 --> 01:46:24.848
You are giving what God has given you.

01:46:26.180 --> 01:46:32.222
So today I have told you 8-fold movement.

01:46:32.222 --> 01:46:36.472
So you have become half moon, only in mind.

01:46:37.764 --> 01:46:44.556
And the other half, keep it for the next 'Guru Purnima'. Alright ?

01:46:44.597 --> 01:46:47.848
MAY GOD BLESS YOU
