WEBVTT

00:00.190 --> 00:27.390
[Music]

00:18.020 --> 00:31.830
today we are going to worship Raja

00:27.390 --> 00:36.960
Lakshmi the goddess which rules the

00:31.830 --> 00:40.170
Kings it's a very important thing today

00:36.960 --> 00:46.860
to understand that something has

00:40.170 --> 00:55.769
basically gone wrong in the working of

00:46.860 --> 01:04.229
our political systems and why the people

00:55.769 --> 01:09.110
have lost their sense of justice fair

01:04.229 --> 01:13.770
play and the benevolence of the people

01:09.110 --> 01:19.740
well I have you gone wrong that this is

01:13.770 --> 01:27.330
being lost it is not only in India it's

01:19.740 --> 01:31.950
not only in Japan or in England or any

01:27.330 --> 01:36.450
other place where we think there is

01:31.950 --> 01:41.520
democracy there are people in every

01:36.450 --> 01:47.250
country who are really a very very low

01:41.520 --> 01:50.940
level and who are trying to look after

01:47.250 --> 01:52.020
the welfare of them I should say in our

01:50.940 --> 01:59.370
own country

01:52.020 --> 02:04.740
we had great kicks very good and we had

01:59.370 --> 02:09.299
saints who really ruled the kings but

02:04.740 --> 02:13.459
there were real gurus they were the

02:09.299 --> 02:17.040
people who really live their life of

02:13.459 --> 02:23.629
saints they were real Saints inside

02:17.040 --> 02:23.629
outside and the people

02:24.040 --> 02:35.840
also accepted the Kings who had

02:29.740 --> 02:42.040
spiritual background those who respected

02:35.840 --> 02:47.950
spiritually so when the Raja Lakshmi

02:42.040 --> 02:50.360
Lakshmi that is the one responsible for

02:47.950 --> 02:55.340
looking after the benevolence of the

02:50.360 --> 02:58.940
people when she acts people think that

02:55.340 --> 03:01.550
they have not even think they they do it

02:58.940 --> 03:07.160
automatically that they are there for

03:01.550 --> 03:10.660
benevolence they don't have to tell

03:07.160 --> 03:14.780
themselves it just that they feel that

03:10.660 --> 03:18.080
it is their job this is what they have

03:14.780 --> 03:22.030
to do is to look after the people there

03:18.080 --> 03:25.010
to be brought to better levels of life

03:22.030 --> 03:29.420
this is what they think they don't don't

03:25.010 --> 03:32.110
think like a party politics under the

03:29.420 --> 03:36.860
influence of the goddess of Lakshmi

03:32.110 --> 03:40.640
which rules the political side we can

03:36.860 --> 03:45.380
say the kingdoms and order first thing

03:40.640 --> 03:50.990
is generosity when this thing happens

03:45.380 --> 03:55.790
that you get some position if somebody

03:50.990 --> 04:02.300
becomes leader I don't know what happens

03:55.790 --> 04:06.790
to him it is a myth it is ego that gets

04:02.300 --> 04:11.060
bad word but this ego can be easily

04:06.790 --> 04:18.290
managed if you worship the Raja Lakshmi

04:11.060 --> 04:21.290
she is the giver of balance firstly she

04:18.290 --> 04:24.920
writes on the elephant

04:21.290 --> 04:28.010
it is not easy for a lady to climb on an

04:24.920 --> 04:31.400
elephant I have done it and she stood

04:28.010 --> 04:36.289
straight with a complete balanced

04:31.400 --> 04:41.520
attitude I have blessings

04:36.289 --> 04:51.150
are tremendous the first blessing one

04:41.520 --> 04:55.770
gets the environment of dignity dignity

04:51.150 --> 04:58.740
of a king dignity of a cream with her

04:55.770 --> 05:04.759
blessing first of all you get that

04:58.740 --> 05:09.719
dignity that dignity is full of love

05:04.759 --> 05:13.770
love wonders that personality emits

05:09.719 --> 05:15.139
nothing but love and benevolence for us

05:13.770 --> 05:22.020
nothing

05:15.139 --> 05:25.409
wherever she looks in every glance she

05:22.020 --> 05:29.639
blesses people she doesn't expect

05:25.409 --> 05:33.770
anything she's a queen what can you give

05:29.639 --> 05:37.639
to the Queen this is the highest of all

05:33.770 --> 05:42.779
in every way what can you give it to her

05:37.639 --> 05:45.860
so first thing is the sign is that such

05:42.779 --> 05:51.199
a person has a personality that just

05:45.860 --> 05:54.449
blesses me thinks of their benevolence

05:51.199 --> 05:58.710
cares for each and every person or

05:54.449 --> 06:05.939
movers then the second blessing of the

05:58.710 --> 06:11.310
goddess is that to develop a kind of a

06:05.939 --> 06:17.580
temperament which is very dignified but

06:11.310 --> 06:22.199
also very humorous and understanding

06:17.580 --> 06:27.560
what other people are like then Raja

06:22.199 --> 06:33.270
Lakshmi is the one who stands on Dharma

06:27.560 --> 06:38.330
if there is some other me then she will

06:33.270 --> 06:42.629
not bless that person he's a kind of a

06:38.330 --> 06:46.459
divine discretion he should have as to

06:42.629 --> 06:46.459
whom to be kind and whom

06:47.020 --> 06:55.209
punishing that divine discussion should

06:50.740 --> 06:58.689
be there in a person if a king does not

06:55.209 --> 07:04.929
have that divine discretion then he can

06:58.689 --> 07:07.449
punish the good and he may help the bad

07:04.929 --> 07:10.979
people but this divine discretion

07:07.449 --> 07:13.959
disappears when you are self-centered

07:10.979 --> 07:15.879
that's the main point is a complete

07:13.959 --> 07:18.309
detachment about the power should be

07:15.879 --> 07:20.169
their complete detachment

07:18.309 --> 07:22.869
why should Raja Lakshmi care for

07:20.169 --> 07:26.469
anything but now there are some holy

07:22.869 --> 07:29.259
temporary person these days and that and

07:26.469 --> 07:33.459
then they feel haha we are on top of the

07:29.259 --> 07:36.849
earth if you are a king you are a king

07:33.459 --> 07:40.419
so what I mean if you are an impostor

07:36.849 --> 07:42.689
then you might feel your ego but if you

07:40.419 --> 07:48.809
are really the king then you won't feel

07:42.689 --> 07:54.459
if you are under the influence of the

07:48.809 --> 07:59.259
goddess then that is the only thing you

07:54.459 --> 08:02.559
enjoy the rest of it is that whether you

07:59.259 --> 08:06.180
have diamonds or you have silver or you

08:02.559 --> 08:09.969
have anything makes no difference at all

08:06.180 --> 08:14.469
now how people misuse the scriptures

08:09.969 --> 08:18.519
also one should see that Raja Lakshmi is

08:14.469 --> 08:22.419
sitting on the elephant alright so they

08:18.519 --> 08:24.729
should have all very big cars she's

08:22.419 --> 08:28.749
sitting on the elephant because elephant

08:24.729 --> 08:32.019
is the highest animal it's very kind

08:28.749 --> 08:37.979
very forgiving and has such a tremendous

08:32.019 --> 08:41.339
memory she is not sitting there - sure

08:37.979 --> 08:45.819
but she's sitting there to see around

08:41.339 --> 08:51.519
what is happening so the person will

08:45.819 --> 08:56.559
innately a king has the blessings of the

08:51.519 --> 08:58.699
Raja Lakshmi then what does she do what

08:56.559 --> 09:04.229
does she do to such a man

08:58.699 --> 09:06.659
what she does is first his name is

09:04.229 --> 09:11.149
written on the hearts of the people who

09:06.659 --> 09:19.679
me rules she writes it with her own hand

09:11.149 --> 09:24.289
they adore they admire and they try to

09:19.679 --> 09:28.799
imbibe his qualities within himself the

09:24.289 --> 09:36.839
another blessing of Raja Lakshmi is that

09:28.799 --> 09:41.809
she grants a particular type of a body

09:36.839 --> 09:41.809
which has a coefficients which gives

09:42.019 --> 09:54.809
vibrations they may not be very selfish

09:48.209 --> 09:56.969
people to make a big advertisement about

09:54.809 --> 10:01.559
themselves talking about themselves is

09:56.969 --> 10:07.019
that but the way they are wherever they

10:01.559 --> 10:10.199
are be sure so what a politician's has

10:07.019 --> 10:18.949
to understand that he has not to make

10:10.199 --> 10:23.689
money he does not have to have a big

10:18.949 --> 10:29.099
show about himself he has to remember

10:23.689 --> 10:32.549
that I am here for the fame of a good

10:29.099 --> 10:36.869
man he should worry about the fame he

10:32.549 --> 10:40.669
will be living after his death so what

10:36.869 --> 10:47.339
you have to worry is about absolute

10:40.669 --> 10:52.729
correct character so try to make

10:47.339 --> 10:56.669
yourself such beautiful instruments of

10:52.729 --> 11:00.919
Raja Lakshmi that people then they will

10:56.669 --> 11:05.249
see you they will vote for you and

11:00.919 --> 11:08.309
tomorrow you will rule the world I do

11:05.249 --> 11:09.839
not want you to get out of politics or

11:08.309 --> 11:13.320
be attained

11:09.839 --> 11:17.399
but you have to first get the blessings

11:13.320 --> 11:19.170
of the rajalakshmi and then only you

11:17.399 --> 11:23.130
should understand what's wrong with our

11:19.170 --> 11:27.680
country what we have to do what is the

11:23.130 --> 11:30.720
purpose why do we want to become

11:27.680 --> 11:34.829
politicians put your attention from

11:30.720 --> 11:38.329
yourself to outside so now you have to

11:34.829 --> 11:42.570
know that if you have to really take to

11:38.329 --> 11:46.620
politics you have to have the blessings

11:42.570 --> 11:50.550
of Roger and for that you have to build

11:46.620 --> 11:55.920
up yourself with that dignity that says

11:50.550 --> 12:00.680
I bless you from my heart that in every

11:55.920 --> 12:00.680
country such people will come up

12:04.810 --> 12:16.740
