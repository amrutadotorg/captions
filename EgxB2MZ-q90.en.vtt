WEBVTT

00:05.648 --> 00:09.357
Now, first I want to tell you what happened
where I went,

00:09.558 --> 00:13.679
and how we got lots of sahaja yogis
all over.

00:13.880 --> 00:17.363
That’s a very good news.

00:19.389 --> 00:31.090
The first thing was, I went to Lille, where
you know Cathy is doing the organizing.

00:32.985 --> 00:36.224
She is a very sensible person,

00:36.425 --> 00:40.524
and her father is somehow [a] little bit
opposed to Sahaja Yoga,

00:40.725 --> 00:44.641
but mother is not. And she called Me
to her place for lunch.

00:44.842 --> 00:48.738
[Aside] What are you doing now? Please
keep it on the side. Now.

00:50.051 --> 00:56.095
And when I went to her house the mother
was suffering from arthritis

00:56.296 --> 01:02.254
and things like that, and I cured her,
and she got realization.

01:02.470 --> 01:07.051
That convinced the mother very much,
and she was very happy.

01:07.616 --> 01:16.777
Then in the evening she had booked
a hall in Lille

01:16.978 --> 01:24.985
and to our amazement we had lots of people.
We were surprised

01:25.186 --> 01:31.835
that how about sixty people or sixty-five
people were there in the hall.

01:32.861 --> 01:43.522
And among them were some very, very
nice people.

01:44.374 --> 01:58.292
One of the friends of Cathy, her mother
came

01:58.516 --> 02:03.829
and they got their realization so fast
in Lille that I was surprised.

02:04.030 --> 02:08.844
And there we met husband and wife who
had been with TM.

02:09.045 --> 02:13.721
Very sensible people, both of them were
really very sensible.

02:13.922 --> 02:20.069
When I explained to them what was
Sahaja Yoga

02:20.706 --> 02:22.629
they didn’t test their realization,

02:22.830 --> 02:27.156
but they understood that there was
something great about it.

02:27.467 --> 02:33.641
So they said, “All right, we are coming
with You to Paris.”

02:33.842 --> 02:40.853
And one lady had come from Belgium. I took
her also, and we went to Paris.

02:41.054 --> 02:44.397
They have their father’s house there,
they stayed in their father’s house.

02:44.606 --> 02:52.523
And these two were wonderful people and
they followed us even to Orleans.

02:52.724 --> 02:58.857
But in Paris the advertisement did not
appear for two days.

02:59.058 --> 03:02.481
But these people had put some posters.

03:02.682 --> 03:09.231
We got about seventy-five people
on the first day.

03:09.524 --> 03:13.397
And in that we got a priest also there.

03:13.598 --> 03:17.822
Out of that at least eighty per cent
got realization.

03:18.023 --> 03:21.334
They again came second day and came
third day.

03:21.535 --> 03:25.608
And the third day it was in the paper,
so there was a bigger crowd,

03:25.809 --> 03:28.731
much bigger crowd, and it was a much
bigger hall.

03:28.947 --> 03:34.538
And about eighty persons, eighty persons
have got realization there,

03:34.739 --> 03:40.091
who are really very good. And they have
decided to start a good center in Paris.

03:40.292 --> 03:42.689
Even in Lille now the center has started

03:42.890 --> 03:45.938
because these husband-wife are going
to start a center there.

03:46.139 --> 03:49.522
Then I went to - you must have heard about
Chartres.

03:49.723 --> 03:54.038
It’s a very beautiful church there.
Went to see that church;

03:54.239 --> 03:59.010
it was very beautiful. Very good vibrations
from that place.

03:59.211 --> 04:05.171
And then we went to Orleans, where we were
just informed

04:05.372 --> 04:10.837
a hall to be booked for us, and we had
then one advertisement.

04:11.038 --> 04:17.918
Only on one advertisement there were
about seventy people.

04:18.119 --> 04:26.073
And practically everybody got realization.
Except for some TM’s they are good,

04:26.274 --> 04:31.891
and as usual they were very funny –
but they went away.

04:32.092 --> 04:38.209
And we had another gentleman who came
in his orange robe, who has …

04:38.410 --> 04:42.668
he says he has taken a sanyasa and he
has some technique and this and that,

04:42.869 --> 04:48.999
but Marie said there is no technique for
Sahaja Yoga, there’s no technique of God.

04:49.200 --> 04:51.917
And then he and one or two with him,
they went away.

04:52.118 --> 04:54.726
But so many people got realization,

04:54.927 --> 04:58.992
and they offered their houses for their
centers and all that.

04:59.193 --> 05:01.773
But the hall - the man who was organizing
the hall,

05:01.974 --> 05:06.532
he said that he just charges six pounds
per meeting.

05:06.733 --> 05:10.718
So why should we have another hall? And so
we decided to have the hall there.

05:10.919 --> 05:15.906
It was done by a girl who came from
Australia, her name was Annie.

05:16.107 --> 05:19.346
She had met Warren there because
she knew him before,

05:19.547 --> 05:23.517
but Warren didn’t tell him [her] about
what had happened.

05:23.718 --> 05:28.007
When she came back she wrote to him that,
“I saw such a tremendous change in you,

05:28.208 --> 05:31.494
I didn’t understand how you got this
change. You were so settled down

05:31.695 --> 05:34.975
and so detached from things and you
were very different

05:35.176 --> 05:39.612
otherwise, so particular about every
details and things like that.

05:39.821 --> 05:42.325
All that had vanished, and you had become
such a relaxed man,

05:42.526 --> 05:45.503
and your attention was somebody else.
How did it happen?”.

05:45.704 --> 05:49.347
Then he wrote to her, “It is Sahaja Yoga,
you go and see Gregoire.”

05:49.548 --> 05:55.020
And Gregoire gave her realization.
Then she went and saw Marie,

05:55.221 --> 06:00.136
and Marie confirmed it, and the whole
thing became all right.

06:00.337 --> 06:06.659
Now, Marie is a person who has really
done such a lot, such a lot,

06:06.860 --> 06:11.433
and all out she went, to do everything
that is possible.

06:11.634 --> 06:18.656
Then from there I came back to Paris
and then I flew to Madrid.

06:18.857 --> 06:22.627
We had two programs in Madrid.

06:22.828 --> 06:27.863
Actually, Gavin had sent her one
advertisement, which appeared

06:28.064 --> 06:31.337
and a second never appeared, only
the one appeared there.

06:31.538 --> 06:37.501
And when I reached there I was wondering
how many people would be there.

06:37.702 --> 06:43.687
There were about hundred and twenty people
in the hall, and we didn’t know what to do.

06:43.888 --> 06:47.892
It was so suffocatingly crowded we did
not know what to do.

06:48.093 --> 06:50.945
But we found out fifty per cent of them
were frivolous people.

06:51.146 --> 06:53.860
They were saying, “We don’t believe
in God,” and they were talking,

06:54.061 --> 06:58.296
“We don’t believe in Christ. This
Catholicism we are against,”

06:58.497 --> 07:03.020
and all sorts of things, you see. And
the fifty percent got realization.

07:03.221 --> 07:05.840
And they were very, I mean, they were
reactionaries, they said,

07:06.041 --> 07:08.439
“How could God be there if there is so much
poverty?”

07:08.640 --> 07:12.052
This, that nonsense they were talking.

07:13.252 --> 07:21.159
But that day the girl who came from
Switzerland, her name was Miryam,

07:21.360 --> 07:26.322
she is also a Catholic and she had problems
because of that.

07:26.523 --> 07:29.739
And another was Elaine; she’s another
very intelligent girl,

07:29.940 --> 07:33.874
something like Gregoire’s elder sister,
extremely brilliant girl,

07:34.075 --> 07:37.081
and she could see the point very well
and she was so clever.

07:37.282 --> 07:40.687
She said, “Only I got it once, and
the Kundalini is now

07:40.888 --> 07:44.393
doing everything for me, She goes up,
She teaches me, and whenever I do wrong,

07:44.594 --> 07:47.179
She comes down and She teaches me, She
gives me faith,

07:47.380 --> 07:52.349
She’s so kind to me.” She’s so sensitive,
I was so amazed at her.

07:52.550 --> 07:54.965
The another person was Miryam, who was
little bit suffering

07:55.166 --> 07:58.259
with this Catholicism sort of thing.

07:58.460 --> 08:02.226
And then I brought her round, I brought
this one lady round,

08:02.427 --> 08:07.398
but she could not translate Me. And then
people started helping her to translate.

08:07.599 --> 08:09.844
Then one of the gentlemen was sitting
there, I said,

08:10.045 --> 08:12.505
“All right, why don’t you come and
translate?” So he came forward

08:12.714 --> 08:15.454
and he was like a professor, in the way
he started translating Me,

08:15.655 --> 08:20.115
as if he knew Sahaja Yoga very well.
He did beautiful translation.

08:20.316 --> 08:25.547
He got his realization, he went away.
Next day the hall was to be -

08:25.748 --> 08:29.825
we had to shift to another hall, a very big
hall, very beautiful hall, and all that.

08:30.026 --> 08:34.768
Then when we went to the bigger hall,
you’ll be amazed,

08:34.969 --> 08:38.788
there must be at least ninety people
or maybe

08:38.989 --> 08:41.591
hundred people in that hall – second day.

08:41.792 --> 08:45.769
And all very sensible and nice people,
they didn’t have all these things.

08:45.970 --> 08:50.053
And so attentive, so attentive
to My lecture.

08:50.254 --> 08:55.007
But the first thing that had happened is
when I went to Paris

08:55.208 --> 08:59.225
was something very remarkable, if you like,
which was repeated again here.

08:59.426 --> 09:05.819
This priest came to see Me and he said
that he couldn’t get his realization.

09:06.020 --> 09:09.259
So he wrote a letter to Me, that “Mother,
I have a secret guru,

09:09.460 --> 09:14.587
in Rameshwaram, his name is such and such.
When I go there, I stay with him

09:14.788 --> 09:17.823
and I cannot get realization, I don’t
know why.”

09:18.024 --> 09:21.376
So I told him, “There should be no problem
because your guru is a realized soul.”

09:21.577 --> 09:26.138
I could see vibration-wise. Then he
told Me, “Yes, he told me

09:26.339 --> 09:29.801
that She is the Mother, She is going
to emancipate the whole world,

09:30.002 --> 09:33.093
and you just can get your emancipation
through Her.”

09:33.294 --> 09:37.611
And this was really energy-giving. I was
so happy to hear

09:37.812 --> 09:42.007
that people are now recognizing, these
gurus are recognizing

09:42.208 --> 09:47.850
and they are understanding My value.
And I’ve never seen this fellow before.

09:48.051 --> 09:52.792
The same thing was repeated in the second
program of Madrid,

09:52.993 --> 09:55.670
where this gentleman appeared on the scene.
I’ve forgotten his name,

09:55.871 --> 09:58.075
but Marie has all the names and all that.

09:58.276 --> 10:02.167
And he just came in the beginning
of the hall, he sat there.

10:02.368 --> 10:06.401
He took charge of the whole place and he
said, “Mother, I’m going to translate You.”

10:06.602 --> 10:09.549
And he knew Spanish and English very well.

10:09.750 --> 10:12.926
He stood up and he translated Me,
he looked after everyone,

10:13.127 --> 10:18.047
extremely wise and sensible fellow.
And I asked him, “How are you here?”

10:18.248 --> 10:21.839
He said, “I’ve come to do this work,
Mother, specially.”

10:22.040 --> 10:25.161
And he told Me, “My guru’s name is
Swami Ram

10:25.362 --> 10:28.593
and he lives on the Himalayas, he doesn’t
go out anywhere.”

10:28.794 --> 10:31.809
I said, “He is a realized soul, I know,
he is a realized soul.”

10:32.017 --> 10:34.202
Then he didn’t talk to Me but he talked
to these girls.

10:34.403 --> 10:37.879
He said that, “My guru has told me that
She is Her Holiness.

10:38.080 --> 10:40.573
She will come to Madrid, you go
and help Her.

10:40.774 --> 10:45.321
That’s why I waited for Mother to come.”
So, such a help is coming to us now.

10:45.522 --> 10:48.914
Now I want to know what our London
Sahaja Yogis specially

10:49.115 --> 10:52.060
are going to do about themselves.

10:52.459 --> 10:59.043
That is a very important matter because
I find the progress is very slow.

11:02.930 --> 11:08.860
Extremely slow, vibration-wise there’s
not much progress.

11:09.061 --> 11:12.146
Even Regis doesn’t have good vibrations.
I saw him,

11:12.347 --> 11:15.269
I was surprised, he’s lost his vibrations
quite a lot.

11:15.470 --> 11:20.091
And same with Peter I would say, he was
quite bad.

11:20.292 --> 11:24.056
And this is something I can’t understand,
what’s happening to you.

11:24.257 --> 11:28.576
So it may be that you people feel guilty,
or do some sort of a nonsense of your mind,

11:28.777 --> 11:33.422
and you go on thinking or I don’t know
what you are doing.

11:35.676 --> 11:39.054
You have to improve in your vibrations.

11:39.533 --> 11:42.648
I think Harry is the only person who has
improved, very much.

11:42.849 --> 11:46.283
So what are you doing? Sitting and sulking
and thinking and putting your mind

11:46.484 --> 11:54.328
into something nonsensical? Paying more
attention to something like food? Is it?

11:57.044 --> 12:01.035
That, “What food should we eat, what
should we have for food?”

12:01.236 --> 12:06.867
You must know if you are staying
in an ashram, ashram is a training.

12:07.068 --> 12:10.481
What is the training you have to have?
Let us see now.

12:10.682 --> 12:15.313
Is not to how to manage food, is to how
to manage yourself.

12:15.521 --> 12:19.801
The main thing is you have to see
where is your attention.

12:20.380 --> 12:23.512
What are you doing about your attention?

12:23.760 --> 12:26.730
Are you putting it to food and all these
nonsensical things

12:26.931 --> 12:34.577
and money and finances and this and that?
If that is so, it is not going to help you.

12:37.166 --> 12:40.045
“We should have this for food, we should
have that for food.”

12:40.246 --> 12:44.597
Now I have found out that Western people
waste so much of their energy

12:44.798 --> 12:49.482
in decision-making. And what are
the decisions you have made, so far?

12:49.683 --> 12:54.051
Like, what food should we have?
What does it become ultimately,

12:54.252 --> 13:01.560
all the food that you decide to eat?
Same about our lives.

13:01.761 --> 13:09.090
When we think and try to plan our lives,
what do we make out of it?

13:09.298 --> 13:13.729
What is the ultimate result of our life,
we should think.

13:14.389 --> 13:19.045
Because of this ego-orientation this
decision-making is there.

13:19.246 --> 13:24.027
I’m amazed how this decision-making
about food has started.

13:24.228 --> 13:28.357
Actually ashram is a place where you should
try to control your attention

13:28.558 --> 13:36.684
and deny things. That’s why people
used to fast.

13:36.885 --> 13:39.713
If that extreme is not there, this extreme
is also not good,

13:39.914 --> 13:43.534
is to think, what you are going to eat
today, what you are going to eat tomorrow,

13:43.735 --> 13:45.990
what are we going to have for food, what -

13:46.191 --> 13:50.517
I think, best thing is you better fast
every evening, that’s a better idea.

13:50.718 --> 13:55.983
Is the best idea is that you all fast,
so that there is no attention about food.

13:56.184 --> 13:59.581
And what a thing to waste about!

14:01.813 --> 14:05.851
And there is a quarrel on, “And this much
money saved, that has happened, that ….”

14:06.052 --> 14:09.291
You forget about money and forget
about all this.

14:09.492 --> 14:12.977
You have to improve your vibrations.

14:13.558 --> 14:16.879
In the ashram you have not come here
to find a convenience.

14:17.087 --> 14:20.748
I have told you before and today again.

14:23.020 --> 14:27.310
We have to improve our vibrations,
our relations with each other.

14:27.511 --> 14:30.496
Now another thing I want to tell you,
nobody should talk to each other

14:30.697 --> 14:35.220
saying, “Mother says so.” I think you stop
all your meetings, that’s a better idea.

14:35.421 --> 14:38.147
“Mother said so, Mother said so.”
I never say to anyone.

14:38.348 --> 14:42.167
If I have to say, I’ll say you directly.
Nobody should use this phrase.

14:42.368 --> 14:45.299
I’m requesting all of you. “Mother
said so.”

14:45.500 --> 14:49.739
I am very public and I say everything
public.

14:49.947 --> 14:55.317
So, nobody should pass words to anyone
saying, “Mother said so.”

14:57.343 --> 15:00.436
And whatever is in Sahaja Yoga is already
quite a lot.

15:00.637 --> 15:03.797
Learn from that. You don’t start teaching
new things.

15:03.998 --> 15:09.311
Because you will act as mediums, and bhoots
will act through you.

15:09.512 --> 15:15.388
And you will become real mediums of real
satanic forces.

15:21.398 --> 15:25.646
Last time I was quite harsh about it,
I said to you

15:25.855 --> 15:29.990
that these things are to be seen
in a proper perspective.

15:30.191 --> 15:36.648
But what I find there is no prudence
in you; there is no prudence of any kind.

15:36.849 --> 15:39.334
You fight among yourselves.

15:39.543 --> 15:44.545
Doesn’t matter if somebody says something
to you. All right? Just - just bear it up.

15:44.746 --> 15:48.923
In Sahaja Yoga you have to learn
how to bear it up.

15:49.584 --> 15:55.126
How much you can bear from others.
Nothing is going to be lost.

15:55.526 --> 15:58.934
I’ll give you a very simple example.

15:59.840 --> 16:07.920
Dhumal had a friend, Mani, and he got
jealous of Dhumal, very jealous.

16:08.121 --> 16:14.030
Then he started finding faults with him,
he complained Me about him, against him,

16:14.231 --> 16:16.408
“This happened, that happened.” He was
a very dominating man,

16:16.609 --> 16:19.633
he was a lecturer and all that and he used
to think no end of himself.

16:19.841 --> 16:23.042
I told him that, “You do not fuss about
things, it’s not good,

16:23.243 --> 16:27.942
you are a very fussy person, you better
keep quiet. And you try to bear it up.”

16:28.143 --> 16:33.021
But he would not listen. This happened
about, say, three years back.

16:33.222 --> 16:37.867
And last time I met him, I told him that,
“Now you will be in for trouble

16:38.068 --> 16:40.472
if you don’t stop this nonsense of your –
of fighting.”

16:40.673 --> 16:45.006
What does it matter? You do your best.
How much have you borne?

16:45.207 --> 16:49.537
What have you done? You have got
the example of Christ!

16:49.942 --> 16:51.738
How much sweetness are you pouring
to others?

16:51.939 --> 16:54.662
Everybody trying to show their knowledge
of Sahaja Yoga.

16:54.863 --> 16:59.516
Best way is to articulate among yourselves
the Spirit of love.

16:59.710 --> 17:02.138
Instead of becoming, everybody becoming
a great leader,

17:02.339 --> 17:07.292
is better you lead yourself and that
will help you.

17:07.493 --> 17:11.931
Now same thing happened with this Mani
and he would not listen to Me till the end.

17:12.132 --> 17:16.412
I mean, before Me he was like a cow,
and when I came away, he was a bull.

17:16.637 --> 17:19.780
Every time he did that, and his attention
was so badly spoiled,

17:19.981 --> 17:23.493
I told him, “Look after your vibrations.”

17:24.041 --> 17:26.291
He was not bothered, and he was trying
to show off, and today

17:26.492 --> 17:30.754
his letter has come – he has got leukemia.

17:37.129 --> 17:41.052
In Sahaja Yoga one should never get
any cancer, is out of question.

17:41.253 --> 17:45.731
But one gets it because of your attention.

17:47.558 --> 17:51.703
People have been cured of leukemia.
Why they are getting leukemia?

17:51.904 --> 17:56.574
It happens if your attention is not
correct, you will get it.

17:56.775 --> 18:01.524
Today his letter has come that he has
got leukemia.

18:02.876 --> 18:09.596
So to show temper, if you get angry,
anything is against you.

18:10.630 --> 18:13.665
Try to love each other, just bear it up.

18:13.866 --> 18:18.725
And do not be agitated too much, and do
not demand.

18:18.926 --> 18:22.046
The humblest are going to enter
into the Kingdom of God.

18:22.247 --> 18:24.891
The meek people are going to enter
into the Kingdom of God.

18:25.092 --> 18:29.436
Not the ones who are very particular
about something and who take decisions.

18:29.637 --> 18:35.768
Please keep decision-making at zero,
“I do not take any decision.

18:35.982 --> 18:42.360
I will not take any decision. Let Mother
take the decision.”

18:43.474 --> 18:45.870
This is the way you can do it. Now,
everywhere

18:46.071 --> 18:48.454
Sahaja Yoga is coming up, people are
understanding.

18:48.655 --> 18:52.372
You have to discipline yourself; there is
no idea of discipline.

18:52.573 --> 18:57.382
You try to disciplining others and nothing
about yourself.

18:58.740 --> 19:02.871
Everything that is living is disciplined.

19:03.072 --> 19:07.717
See on a tree how the leaves spread,
how they discipline themselves

19:07.918 --> 19:12.550
and how they arrange themselves.
Is there any fight going on?

19:15.662 --> 19:19.605
First of all, decision-making about food
should be zero.

19:19.806 --> 19:24.609
Please stop all the meetings, I think that
is also another ego-trips going on.

19:24.810 --> 19:30.433
All the ego-trips, meetings, what do you
achieve? This.

19:31.039 --> 19:34.049
Better not have any more meetings,
you’d better all sit down

19:34.250 --> 19:38.956
and quietly meditate within yourself,
and work it out, properly.

19:39.172 --> 19:41.408
Your vibrations should be all right,
that’s the main point is.

19:41.609 --> 19:45.407
And do not deceive yourself. You have
to grow!

19:45.608 --> 19:49.590
There should be prudence that you have
to grow, nobody else has to grow.

19:49.791 --> 19:53.298
You are the losers. Who is the loser?

19:57.545 --> 20:01.119
Now, Mr. Paul went there, and I don’t know
what happened,

20:01.320 --> 20:03.881
he went there, stayed with Dhumal.
Now, Dhumal has given

20:04.082 --> 20:07.873
realization to ten thousand people. And
Mr. Paul thinks no end of himself,

20:08.074 --> 20:10.690
he thinks that he is a very great guy
and he can do anything.

20:10.891 --> 20:12.932
He went and said, “Why do you have
a servant in the house,

20:13.133 --> 20:15.674
you are enjoying yourself, your servant
is working like this”,

20:15.875 --> 20:20.510
and he fought with them. And he came
away, misbehaving.

20:20.711 --> 20:25.676
What does he think of himself? It’s a very,
very bad manners.

20:25.877 --> 20:28.854
I never knew that you are to be told that
when you go to somebody’s house –

20:29.062 --> 20:34.549
the guest, if you are a guest – somebody’s
house, you are not to behave like this.

20:34.981 --> 20:39.141
And he quarrelled and fought and came away.

20:42.531 --> 20:46.649
Now, what are we to say? They have written
to say that he quarrelled very much.

20:46.850 --> 20:52.568
He is so much elder to you. Apart from
that, in Sahaja Yoga he is senior to you.

20:53.514 --> 20:57.211
This is the thing: no sense of respect.

21:03.665 --> 21:07.737
I think you have to take up things much
more seriously. I’ve seen also,

21:07.938 --> 21:12.288
people laugh at others – all of you
suddenly start laughing, suddenly.

21:12.489 --> 21:16.780
Must develop your dignity. You must develop
your dignity.

21:16.981 --> 21:20.339
Even when you talk to Me I have seen,
“hehehe…”,  like that you laugh,

21:20.540 --> 21:25.932
and then say something. It’s not the way
to talk to Me, it’s also wrong.

21:26.513 --> 21:31.740
If your dignity is not all right, you are
not going to get deeper into it.

21:32.885 --> 21:35.540
Now, better stop all meetings and all
these things.

21:35.756 --> 21:40.307
For what? For arranging food? Is it
a hotel here?

21:40.832 --> 21:43.422
Just arranging somebody’s food is whatever
you get,

21:43.623 --> 21:46.979
just eat and don’t say anything about
the food.

21:47.306 --> 21:50.112
Some do not want to cook, some want
to cook. What is this?

21:50.313 --> 21:53.956
Everybody should be forward there,
“Yes, I will cook, I’ll do, I’ll learn.”

21:54.157 --> 21:58.706
Nobody has this desire, “I will do.
I will do.”

21:58.994 --> 22:04.420
Labour saving, money saving, all kinds
of devices.

22:06.367 --> 22:10.284
It is not good for you! It’s not proper
for you.

22:10.485 --> 22:14.274
You just see your own selfishness.
You have to grow in Sahaja Yoga;

22:14.475 --> 22:18.691
you have to become great in Sahaja Yoga,
you are not to waste yourself.

22:18.892 --> 22:21.439
And when I say something, you think
I’m saying about somebody else.

22:21.640 --> 22:25.157
You just put it to yourself, the same
question, and ask yourself, “Where am I?”

22:25.358 --> 22:28.638
That’s the way you are going to improve,
and you don’t know

22:28.839 --> 22:32.139
how much work I want you to do when
I go away from you.

22:32.340 --> 22:37.178
But I am sure that I cannot send you
anywhere – you’ll create problems.

22:37.379 --> 22:42.015
Mr. Paul went there and he’s … and
everybody is shocked at him.

22:42.216 --> 22:44.494
That he doesn’t even have proper manners.

22:44.695 --> 22:47.084
This quarrelsomeness is one thing
should be avoided.

22:47.285 --> 22:52.108
Anybody who is quarrelsome is not
a sahaja yogi.

22:52.309 --> 22:55.134
You are not to quarrel for anything;
even if somebody beats you,

22:55.335 --> 23:01.276
even if somebody slaps you on one side,
you turn the other.

23:01.481 --> 23:08.691
That is Sahaja Yoga. Don’t forget
your teachings.

23:09.136 --> 23:14.653
If somebody slaps you on right side,
you turn your left side to that person.

23:14.854 --> 23:19.682
And the one who is a trouble-maker should
be branded as that.

23:20.017 --> 23:25.078
Who fusses, who troubles, who makes,
This should be done, that should be done,”

23:25.279 --> 23:28.596
he should be treated like that.

23:30.923 --> 23:34.094
You must also try to give Me some joy
and happiness.

23:34.295 --> 23:39.143
Or always must you give Me headaches?
I would request you now

23:39.344 --> 23:43.579
to give Me less headaches, otherwise
I will never come to London.

23:48.787 --> 23:50.724
What I hear, somebody fighting
with someone,

23:50.925 --> 23:54.701
something happening with someone,
I don’t like it!

23:56.580 --> 23:59.922
Now, another thing I have to tell you
is this,

24:00.123 --> 24:05.740
that I was thinking that if you people feel
all right, your vibrations are all right,

24:05.941 --> 24:08.558
if you are settled down, if you really
become gurus –

24:08.759 --> 24:15.516
guru means dignity, humility, meekness,
understanding, loveable nature –

24:15.725 --> 24:20.943
all these things must be developed in you,
you cannot suddenly become like that.

24:21.144 --> 24:27.991
In that case you should decide to go
to various places

24:28.192 --> 24:34.600
in England and also outside. I have
arranged for that.

24:34.801 --> 24:40.567
For example, now TM people. They can act
as mediums, even now.

24:40.768 --> 24:44.369
You can see that, it does happen, you have
to be very careful about it.

24:44.570 --> 24:47.189
You will become mediums of satanic forces.

24:47.390 --> 24:51.558
And you have to be very, very careful,
extremely careful about it.

24:51.759 --> 24:53.576
For I have talked to people…

24:53.777 --> 24:57.406
Now you have to save all the TM people,
I have already arranged that.

24:57.607 --> 25:01.847
There are two places in Paris who want you
to go down there to talk to them.

25:02.048 --> 25:05.700
I have also asked people in Nice – they are
very anxious.

25:05.901 --> 25:08.981
There are people in Madrid who want
to arrange a program

25:09.182 --> 25:11.381
where you can talk about it.

25:11.582 --> 25:14.433
Now look at how negativity, this thing,
worked out.

25:14.634 --> 25:20.230
Bart went to Paris and he told one
Ceylonese gentleman against you.

25:20.431 --> 25:24.822
He said that, “He’s not giving me my money,
he’s not paid for me, he told me lies

25:25.023 --> 25:29.542
that I’ll give you so much money, he did
not give me any money and this and that.”

25:29.750 --> 25:32.411
When I was talking about it, he came out
with a thing,

25:32.612 --> 25:36.923
“Is that the same Peter Pearce who was
a cook?” I said, “Cook? He is not a cook.”

25:37.124 --> 25:40.229
He said, “Yes, Bart told me about him.”
I said, “He is not a cook,

25:40.430 --> 25:43.097
he was the head of the thing and all that.”

25:43.298 --> 25:45.781
He said, “No, but Bart told me that money
was not given and…”

25:45.982 --> 25:49.173
“How do you know Bart?” He said,
“He is my old friend,” this and that.

25:49.374 --> 25:51.249
Now, I could not say much against him,

25:51.450 --> 25:54.188
but I said, “Why did Bart tell you like
this? He never even met Me.”

25:54.389 --> 25:56.921
He said, “He is a very shy person, he did
not want to meet,

25:57.105 --> 26:00.234
but he was telling me that Sahaja Yogis
are horrible people,

26:00.450 --> 26:04.409
Mother believes them, She is too simple.
And they are not worth believing.

26:04.616 --> 26:10.119
They are all very horrid, and they are
extremely dominating

26:10.320 --> 26:14.853
and all sorts of things Bart has told.”
I said, “Bart should come and see Me.

26:15.061 --> 26:17.809
If he had told Me I would have corrected
these things.

26:18.010 --> 26:21.868
And all right,” I said, “he went into
bankruptcy, he went into trouble

26:22.069 --> 26:25.372
and that’s how he did not get money,
but he should have told Me.

26:25.573 --> 26:28.788
Why didn’t he tell Me about it? That,
‘I’m going away’, he never told Me.

26:28.989 --> 26:33.617
He went away. Now he has no business
to talk against Sahaja Yogis”.

26:33.818 --> 26:35.773
And I received another letter from this,

26:35.973 --> 26:38.654
one of the hippies who had come to our
program.

26:38.855 --> 26:42.024
[Aside: Which writing I haven’t got it,
or I don’t know, maybe it’s there.]

26:42.225 --> 26:47.636
who says that, “Mother, Your Sahaja
Yogi in …

26:47.837 --> 26:50.931
You are all right but Your Sahaja Yogis,
we cannot bear them.

26:51.132 --> 26:54.315
They are very dominating, they think
of no end of themselves.

26:54.492 --> 26:57.247
When they talk to us, they talk in such
a way, “’Do this, do that.’”

26:57.448 --> 27:00.453
All sorts of a letter he has written.
And he said that,

27:00.654 --> 27:04.578
“We would all have liked to come in,
but we don’t like this kind of people

27:04.779 --> 27:09.036
trying to dominate us, and they are very
intellectualizing and…” –

27:09.237 --> 27:15.316
all sorts of things, they have written
about you. Now, this is what it is.

27:15.517 --> 27:18.840
So the secret of Sahaja Yoga failing
in England is Sahaja Yogis,

27:19.041 --> 27:22.669
not Mataji Nirmala Devi.

27:27.908 --> 27:34.776
You must know that you represent Me.
Try to imbibe some of My qualities.

27:35.484 --> 27:39.138
Do I ever complain about food?

27:41.401 --> 27:47.551
Some of My qualities. You must show
patience.

27:49.902 --> 27:56.148
Now, the best way would be to pray. Prayer
is a very great thing for Sahaja Yogis.

27:56.349 --> 28:02.517
Pray with your heart. First of all, you
must ask for strength from Mother.

28:02.718 --> 28:07.107
“Give me strength so that I be genuine,
I won’t deceive myself.”

28:07.308 --> 28:10.637
We are deceiving ourselves, morning
till evening.

28:10.838 --> 28:15.699
“Give me strength that I face myself and
say it with my heart

28:15.900 --> 28:18.273
that I try to improve myself.”

28:18.474 --> 28:22.675
Because these are defects which are not
your own, they are outside.

28:22.876 --> 28:27.615
If they fall off, you’ll feel all right,
you’ll be perfect.

28:27.871 --> 28:37.592
Now, then you should ask for forgiveness,
pray for forgiveness.

28:37.793 --> 28:42.409
There should be prayer, you say that,
“You forgive me

28:42.610 --> 28:46.843
because I have been ignorant, I did not
know what to do,

28:47.044 --> 28:49.591
I have done mistakes, so You please
forgive me.”

28:49.792 --> 28:54.053
That is the first thing one has to ask,
is the forgiveness.

28:54.258 --> 29:00.081
The second thing you ask for is,
“Give me a sweet tongue.

29:00.282 --> 29:04.888
A method by which I become communicative
with others,

29:05.089 --> 29:10.322
others respect me, they like me,
they like my presence.

29:10.523 --> 29:13.073
Give me strength. Give me love,

29:13.274 --> 29:17.743
give me that beauty of culture, beauty
of understanding

29:17.944 --> 29:23.035
that everybody loves me, wants me.”
Ask for prayer.

29:23.759 --> 29:32.008
In the prayer you ask that, “Oh Lord, give
me the sense of security of my Spirit,

29:32.930 --> 29:40.120
so that I do not feel insecured, and by
which I trouble others, or get angry.

29:40.471 --> 29:46.170
Give me sense of my own dignity, so that
I do not feel that I am belittled

29:46.371 --> 29:51.007
or somebody has littled me.” If you are at
a higher position nobody can belittle you.

29:51.208 --> 29:55.854
It’s only you belittle by your foolishness
and doubtfulness.

29:56.055 --> 30:01.789
Ask for strength that, “Give me my witness
state,

30:03.919 --> 30:08.351
give me satisfaction.” Ask from Me
satisfaction.

30:08.552 --> 30:12.503
“Let me feel my satisfaction from
what I have.

30:12.704 --> 30:15.542
Whatever I have, whatever I eat,
everything,

30:15.743 --> 30:19.053
take out my attention away from all
these things.”

30:19.254 --> 30:21.604
You know that your attention is
in the stomach,

30:21.805 --> 30:24.228
and those who are very much interested
in food

30:24.429 --> 30:28.516
will get liver in any case, whatever
you may try.

30:33.215 --> 30:36.366
“In anything like this, wherever
my attention is going,

30:36.567 --> 30:41.037
please give me strength to pull it back -
Chitta nirodha.

30:41.247 --> 30:46.328
Teach me how to avoid things that tempt me,

30:46.791 --> 30:53.491
that take away my attention, take away
my thoughts.

30:53.885 --> 30:59.183
Give me witness state by which I see
the whole drama.

30:59.384 --> 31:03.712
Let me never spite others and criticize
others.

31:03.913 --> 31:08.701
Let me see my mistakes, not others.

31:08.902 --> 31:11.840
Let me see why people are not happy
with me.

31:12.041 --> 31:17.044
Give me strength to have a very sweet
tongue and a sweet nature

31:17.245 --> 31:22.525
so that others like my company, they enjoy
my company.

31:22.726 --> 31:28.426
Let me be like a flower and not like
a thorn.”

31:28.627 --> 31:32.661
You have to pray. All these prayers
are going to help you.

31:32.868 --> 31:36.116
Then ask for the greatest prayer which
you should ask, that,

31:36.317 --> 31:41.741
“Please keep me away from ego that
gives me ideas

31:41.942 --> 31:45.175
that I’m superior to others, I’m better
than others,

31:45.376 --> 31:50.188
or in any way it takes away my meekness
and my humility.

31:50.389 --> 31:57.775
Give me natural humility by which I can
penetrate into the hearts of people.”

31:57.983 --> 32:01.647
Just you have to bend your head and you
go up to your heart.

32:01.848 --> 32:05.021
You have to bend your head.

32:06.593 --> 32:11.536
Just to bend your head and there is your
heart where resides the Spirit.

32:11.737 --> 32:17.011
Be with it. If you are any way hurting
your ego,

32:17.212 --> 32:20.379
or you are hurting somebody’s ego,
is just the same.

32:20.580 --> 32:23.931
You’ll behave in the same manner,
in the same egoistical manner.

32:24.156 --> 32:27.809
So try to understand that these things
have to go away.

32:28.033 --> 32:31.318
Is best is to pray and ask for help.

32:31.519 --> 32:35.083
Prayer is a very big thing, but with your
heart pray that,

32:35.294 --> 32:42.949
“God give us strength and that growth that
we can please our Mother sometimes.

32:43.150 --> 32:46.588
We want to please our Mother, we want
to see Her happy.”

32:46.789 --> 32:50.099
The only thing that will really give Me
happiness is

32:50.300 --> 32:54.620
that the way I love you, you love
each other.

33:04.167 --> 33:07.133
In the meetings you must discuss
how to raise the Kundalini,

33:07.334 --> 33:10.177
what is the problem, what chakras are
catching, then it’s all right.

33:10.378 --> 33:14.284
But not these meetings, “How much money
to be spent, how to go, how to collect,”

33:14.485 --> 33:17.368
and all this nonsense. Do not waste
your energies on that.

33:17.569 --> 33:20.093
But that doesn’t mean that some people
should not take at all

33:20.294 --> 33:22.125
any interest in cooking, should not
do this.

33:22.326 --> 33:27.352
Everybody should try to do as much
as possible.

33:27.524 --> 33:30.128
People are so lethargic, you see,
their brain starts working.

33:30.336 --> 33:32.088
If you start working with your hands,

33:32.289 --> 33:35.727
you’ll be surprised your thoughts will
stop.

33:36.237 --> 33:39.678
Use your hands. Your thoughts will be
much less.

33:39.879 --> 33:42.647
Try to do some things with your hands.
Try to do, whatever is possible,

33:42.848 --> 33:45.920
whatever you want to do - try to do it
for your own training,

33:46.121 --> 33:49.666
not because somebody else is not doing
or somebody else is doing it.

33:49.867 --> 33:52.808
You just do it because of your training.
Try to do your level best.

33:52.988 --> 33:56.900
You’ll enjoy. You just sing songs and do it
yourself, you don’t worry.

33:57.108 --> 34:00.771
If I started worrying that, “Nobody does
anything for Sahaja Yoga,

34:00.972 --> 34:04.099
why should I do?”, what will happen?

34:04.300 --> 34:08.829
I may give every excuse to get out of it.

34:14.259 --> 34:20.882
Everybody must do some handwork.
It’s compulsory. Something you must do.

34:21.161 --> 34:24.838
Get up suddenly. Let’s see who gets up
first, gets the plates,

34:25.039 --> 34:28.861
serves the people, looks after others,
gives the food to others.

34:29.062 --> 34:33.809
Try to go out of yourself. Selfishness
has to be controlled.

34:34.010 --> 34:39.131
Self-centeredness has to be finished.
Self-indulgencies are to be taken away.

34:39.332 --> 34:43.480
How do you do it? Pray, get the strength
and act.

34:43.681 --> 34:48.902
Otherwise it will end up with prayer only.
You get the strength and do it.

34:49.103 --> 34:52.115
Try to give away things.

34:53.244 --> 34:58.011
This you should decide because Navaratri
is coming now, it’s a very big day.

34:58.212 --> 35:01.388
And Sahaja Yogis have to be prepared
for that day.

35:01.589 --> 35:05.010
It’s a very big privilege for you people
that Navaratri is coming

35:05.211 --> 35:07.822
and there is going to be a Puja
of Navaratri here.

35:08.023 --> 35:13.353
But one thing is compulsory that you all
should improve yourself

35:13.554 --> 35:22.370
and try to be there where a son
of the Mother is sitting.

35:25.190 --> 35:31.109
Be mild. Be sweet.

35:33.048 --> 35:35.996
Create an atmosphere of congeniality.

35:36.197 --> 35:41.129
There should be congenial feeling, loving
care for each other.

35:41.330 --> 35:44.714
If you are fighting with someone you
should say that,

35:44.915 --> 35:48.603
“Oh Lord, how could I have an enemy?
Why did I fight?

35:48.804 --> 35:51.815
Please give me strength so that I should
have no enemy,

35:52.016 --> 35:55.541
so that I do not see any enemy
in another one.

35:55.765 --> 36:03.343
So give me power that I forgive them,
and so that You can forgive me.”

36:08.694 --> 36:15.038
If you can just say these two things,
you can get rid of your thoughts.

36:24.539 --> 36:31.452
Last of all you have to pray that, “Mother,
we should recognize our Mother.

36:32.819 --> 36:39.909
That She has come within us. We are very
fortunate and we know who She is.

36:40.110 --> 36:43.083
Please give us strength so that we
recognize Her

36:43.284 --> 36:50.675
and imbibe that recognition in our life”.
It is not only recognition, but imbibe.

36:55.644 --> 36:59.932
I think in certain things Gregoire is
very good.

37:00.474 --> 37:06.226
He was saying, “In the church when we go,
we never talk loudly, we just talk in hush.

37:06.427 --> 37:10.456
How could we talk loudly in the presence
of Mother, when She is in the house,

37:10.657 --> 37:14.022
how can we? It’s a temple.

37:20.583 --> 37:24.630
How can we talk loudly when She is around?”

37:24.831 --> 37:28.028
I was really surprised how Gregoire could
see that point.

37:28.229 --> 37:33.064
[He] said, “She is a living temple, and how
could we do that?”

37:33.280 --> 37:38.629
Now, before going I want to tell you also -
you have to prepare now for Puja.

37:38.830 --> 37:42.556
The first thing is, that is to be done:
prepare yourself.

37:42.757 --> 37:47.585
I would like to see you in good vibrations
and good conditions.

37:47.746 --> 37:52.597
For you, you get some sugar, you need some
sugar to be - for yourself.

37:52.798 --> 37:58.037
Marcus, now, you take lot of sugar, take,
say, one kilo every day, minimum.

37:58.238 --> 38:03.050
Have you got here some sugar with you?
Bring it; I’ll vibrate it for you.

38:13.639 --> 38:16.614
Now, about this work also I have told you

38:16.815 --> 38:21.570
that you put up this wall as it is in any
dilapidated way you want to put it up,

38:21.771 --> 38:24.570
but put it up. Because later on they will
not have any objection

38:24.771 --> 38:29.209
that the wall was not so high. Just do it
because I have told you, it will help you.

38:29.410 --> 38:31.654
So, just put it up, up to eight feet

38:31.855 --> 38:34.653
and then the rest of it you try to clear
it out.

38:34.854 --> 38:40.719
I would like Alan to make all the things
before I come back.

38:40.920 --> 38:43.658
It’s 17th I’ll be back, there is lot
of time.

38:43.859 --> 38:46.154
So you find out what things are needed.
Yogi: Should we start the foundations?

38:46.355 --> 38:48.652
Shri Mataji: Eh?
Yogi: Should we start the foundations?

38:48.853 --> 38:52.706
Shri Mataji: How can you start without
the permission?

38:53.105 --> 38:55.377
Yogi: No, I was just thinking, You know,
of moving this –

38:55.578 --> 38:59.919
there’s a lot of hard concrete in th
[inaudible]. We could start these.

39:00.120 --> 39:02.886
Shri Mataji: Yes, you can start doing that.
Yogi: I think we need to prove the concrete.

39:03.071 --> 39:07.070
Shri Mataji: Yes, you start doing that. But
you - yes, you do it the way you want to,

39:07.271 --> 39:12.125
you have to do it - before I go I would
like to have the size of that one.

39:12.326 --> 39:14.961
Yogi: Yes. Shri Mataji: As I have to give
it to the sahaja yogis to make one.

39:15.162 --> 39:19.385
And also I would like to know what
we have to do about it,

39:19.586 --> 39:24.410
how we have to organize it and how
you are going to get the money

39:24.611 --> 39:26.714
and how we are going to work it out.

39:26.915 --> 39:32.155
So all this has to be done in a way that’s
very congenial and friendly.

39:32.356 --> 39:37.423
And one should not ask for, say, thirty p
and forty p, a thing,

39:37.624 --> 39:41.285
but on the whole, money should be used
properly.

39:41.486 --> 39:45.228
Even a single pai out of this money should
not be wasted,

39:45.429 --> 39:48.266
nor should be misused, nor should
embezzled.

39:48.467 --> 39:52.532
That is very important. Because, if that
is done,

39:52.733 --> 39:55.993
it will have an effect on all of you,
especially the one who will do.

39:56.194 --> 40:00.046
Now, you have a case of leukemia here,
very clear-cut.

40:00.247 --> 40:03.380
So I do not want you people to have
any suffering

40:03.581 --> 40:07.451
because, actually, Sahaja Yoga helps you.
But if you leave Sahaja Yoga

40:07.652 --> 40:13.356
then you fall into the trap of the satans.
The satans are around you.

40:13.557 --> 40:18.715
Yogi: Mother, I’m afraid the timing of our
doom is just coming.

40:18.916 --> 40:24.121
You know, people have a doom which is
just coming… (indistinct).

40:24.322 --> 40:27.036
Shri Mataji: It’s working out. My attention
is working it out,

40:27.237 --> 40:31.818
but it throws you out also, you go out
of circulation, so be careful.

40:32.019 --> 40:34.020
There’s no use just worrying and being
anxious.

40:34.221 --> 40:38.754
You see, this is a very typical
European-style thinking.

40:38.955 --> 40:41.514
Now you are very anxious, you are very
worried,

40:41.715 --> 40:45.083
you know, you are pessimistic, this, that.

40:45.284 --> 40:48.263
Do all that, and achieve what? Nothing.

40:48.464 --> 40:51.247
Now I must tell you about French, I have
understood them very well.

40:51.448 --> 40:53.442
Now, what they are doing it’s very
interesting

40:53.643 --> 40:56.232
I mean, that doesn’t mean that English
are absolutely all right,

40:56.433 --> 40:58.137
they are also very much the same style.

40:58.338 --> 41:02.302
So I don’t know what to do about it,
but the French,

41:02.503 --> 41:09.770
what the French have done is to decide
that the existence is futile.

41:09.971 --> 41:13.841
That they have got some sort of a … they
had some philosopher

41:14.042 --> 41:16.833
who told them that existence is futile.

41:17.034 --> 41:20.638
So they said, “Oh, then what’s the use,
this life is futile, you see,

41:20.839 --> 41:23.325
then why worry about anything and why …”

41:23.526 --> 41:27.169
So they are very anxious always, very
unhappy people.

41:27.370 --> 41:31.043
They said that, if a person says that he
is very happy,

41:31.244 --> 41:35.865
then they think he is naïve. He doesn’t
know that he is in for hell

41:36.066 --> 41:39.599
and his life is futile, he has no
character.

41:39.800 --> 41:43.513
How can we say that a person is happy?

41:43.714 --> 41:46.951
because by saying “he is happy” that means
he is naïve,

41:47.152 --> 41:50.350
he doesn’t understand the life’s problems
and he is trying to avoid

41:50.551 --> 41:54.585
and he is a foolish man. So they had
to have a person

41:54.786 --> 41:59.153
who has got all his cheeks both inside,
who is drawn out.

41:59.378 --> 42:06.254
He has to be somebody who looks like
nothing on earth.

42:06.455 --> 42:10.525
[ASIDE: This is not such a good sugar
though for you, you should use white.

42:10.726 --> 42:13.799
Mix it up with that. This is much hotter.

42:14.000 --> 42:17.003
And fish you should never eat.

42:17.952 --> 42:20.448
All right, take it.

42:21.063 --> 42:24.449
You can add white to it and eat it.]

42:24.650 --> 42:33.267
Now, so they are very unhappy people and
they are all the time, “Haah, haah, hih.”

42:33.468 --> 42:35.423
I said, “What’s this?” They said,
“This is character.”

42:35.624 --> 42:38.213
If you have character you have to be
unhappy person.

42:38.414 --> 42:40.744
Otherwise, if you are happy, then you are
naïve,

42:40.953 --> 42:43.720
you don’t understand that the whole world
is going to fall off,

42:43.921 --> 42:50.167
that Kalki is coming, you should all sit
with a face like that.

42:50.650 --> 42:52.501
It’s quite funny, isn’t it?

42:52.702 --> 42:54.869
I said, “It’s all right, but when they do
this,

42:55.070 --> 42:57.401
why do they indulge into all these
nonsensical things?”

42:57.602 --> 43:01.182
Like every street has got at least ten
prostitutes, when you walk along,

43:01.383 --> 43:04.853
about thirty places you find ten
prostitutes standing.

43:05.054 --> 43:07.423
They don’t mind prostitution, after all
life is futile.

43:07.658 --> 43:10.783
So what is now? They say. But they are
very unhappy people.

43:10.984 --> 43:15.237
They all will be very unhappy, anxious;
they are extremely anxious, unhappy.

43:15.438 --> 43:17.284
They are the most miserable people.

43:17.485 --> 43:21.305
I said, that’s how Victor Hugo wrote
“Les Miserables”.

43:21.506 --> 43:25.345
All of them are just here, you see, and
that’s how they are the most difficult.

43:25.546 --> 43:27.150
People don’t understand French.

43:27.351 --> 43:29.775
When they talk, their sarcasm is horrid,

43:29.976 --> 43:33.182
their laughter is horrid, their jokes
are horrid.

43:33.414 --> 43:37.479
And whatever they do, they just bite you.
The reason is, the life is futile.

43:37.680 --> 43:41.119
So what does it matter if you bite someone
or you cut somebody’s throat?

43:41.320 --> 43:43.853
Anything is all right, it has a character.

43:44.054 --> 43:48.620
Now the whole thing has reached to such
a futility that that bank robber I saw …

43:48.821 --> 43:51.488
I told you the story about the bank robber
I saw –

43:51.689 --> 43:53.306
has become the big hero now there.

43:53.515 --> 43:56.877
There are stories written after him, there
are poems written,

43:57.078 --> 44:00.964
now there are some pop-singers who are
singing his praise.

44:01.165 --> 44:04.673
I have no place in a society like that.

44:05.296 --> 44:11.063
So this is French, and English also think
that French are very great,

44:11.264 --> 44:13.907
we should be like that, very miserable
people,

44:14.108 --> 44:19.111
absolutely looking like nothing on earth.

44:19.312 --> 44:24.580
So this is the French tradition and French
style, but I have put them right.

44:24.781 --> 44:28.541
I’ve made them smile, laugh aloud and
enjoy themselves.

44:28.742 --> 44:36.884
If I could trigger them, why not the
lethargic friends here?

44:37.085 --> 44:42.166
I said, it’s very nice. I say Europe is
the liver.

44:42.367 --> 44:49.534
Liver is Europe of the universe, where they
drink the most.

44:51.320 --> 44:55.431
India is the Kundalini, where there is
no seeking.

44:55.632 --> 44:59.588
England is the heart, which is lethargic.

44:59.789 --> 45:02.948
God save this universe.

45:06.509 --> 45:11.080
And lethargic to such an extent that they
do not even have lethargy –

45:11.281 --> 45:15.494
they do not have energy even to organize
their food

45:15.695 --> 45:19.830
and organize their things. In small, small
things they go on fighting.

45:20.031 --> 45:24.917
I wish they were [a] little lethargic about
fighting each other.

45:28.241 --> 45:32.837
But the French have started laughing, they
have given up their anxieties,

45:33.038 --> 45:39.306
they are loving each other. Only our
lethargy is a horrible thing.

45:39.507 --> 45:44.033
The whole fight is about how to save money
and how to save labour.

45:44.234 --> 45:48.541
Nobody is going to die if they work hard.
So please work hard.

45:48.742 --> 45:51.633
I’ve been telling you that do something.
Something can be done,

45:51.834 --> 45:55.533
if you don’t get anything you go and hit
your head, but do something.

45:55.734 --> 46:00.010
Do not sit down like that, it’s no good.

46:00.211 --> 46:02.978
Just start doing something with your hands,

46:03.179 --> 46:06.801
because your brains are working, hands are
not working, there’s no balance.

46:07.002 --> 46:09.462
And the brains that work, you know what
they are working it out.

46:09.663 --> 46:13.777
So what’s the use of allowing this brain
to work? Make your hands work.

46:13.978 --> 46:18.720
For example, now, here is Malcolm.
His brain is now growing this way.

46:18.921 --> 46:24.150
He should not use his brain, but his hands.

46:24.455 --> 46:27.275
[Audio interruption]

46:27.775 --> 46:32.191
Like the servant in my house is our feet.

46:32.391 --> 46:36.424
Say, I’m the hands, my husband is the head.

46:36.625 --> 46:39.517
We all work in that unison, together.

46:39.718 --> 46:42.853
When we are like that, there’s no problem;

46:43.054 --> 46:47.752
that servants are needed, wife is needed
and the head of the family is needed.

46:47.953 --> 46:51.478
Because we are doing our own work, so there
is no need to bother about it.

46:51.679 --> 46:56.931
But supposing everybody is only using
the brain, and the rest of it is useless,

46:57.132 --> 47:02.329
then what about the rest? Who’s going
to do it?

47:02.530 --> 47:04.644
Because you are not integrated with
the whole.

47:04.852 --> 47:08.353
Because you are not integrated with your
society, not with your family.

47:08.554 --> 47:10.777
You are only integrated with yourself –
if you are,

47:10.978 --> 47:13.721
I’m also not very sure about that.

47:13.922 --> 47:18.773
But you can only work out your hands and
your head.

47:20.724 --> 47:25.741
So best thing is that all of us should do
some work.

47:25.942 --> 47:27.875
Some work must be done.

47:28.131 --> 47:31.154
Every one of you should serve - to stop
the brain, you see,

47:31.362 --> 47:35.795
when the brain starts thinking, start
cleaning something, painting something.

47:35.996 --> 47:38.563
Get some paint. Why not painting? Get
some paint,

47:38.764 --> 47:40.680
do something, try to do some work.

47:40.881 --> 47:46.233
As soon as your brain starts working, start
doing some work. All right?

47:46.434 --> 47:50.678
That’s the way you can stop thinking
of your brain, which is very important.

47:50.879 --> 47:55.539
Because what this brain is going to take
you to, I don’t know.

47:57.067 --> 48:00.896
H.G. Wells has written certain things
about it, but he also did not know

48:01.097 --> 48:07.812
that brain development can take us to such
madness that you can’t imagine.

48:09.131 --> 48:14.545
Now, the only example is that we came
by bus

48:14.755 --> 48:18.188
and we met two, three people who came
and went away.

48:18.389 --> 48:23.342
They were about My age, some were sixty,
some were sixty-five.

48:23.543 --> 48:28.881
They all came in the bus, they were just
talking, very loudly.

48:29.082 --> 48:32.061
So I asked Marie, “What is he talking?”
“He is talking about last war.”

48:32.262 --> 48:34.639
“To whom?” “He is talking to himself.”
Very loudly.

48:34.840 --> 48:38.163
He got down, still he is talking. Then
another fellow came in,

48:38.364 --> 48:40.397
he started talking about something else,

48:40.598 --> 48:43.318
“…and Marylin Monroe” and all that he
started talking.

48:43.519 --> 48:46.781
Of My age, imagine. I said, “He is talking
so loudly,

48:46.981 --> 48:49.491
nobody says anything to him. That is
unexpected here.”

48:49.692 --> 48:53.053
The third person came in, he said, “See,
this is all expected, you see,

48:53.254 --> 48:55.990
we help everyone, we don’t mind, we are
very tolerant.”

48:56.191 --> 48:58.117
I said, “But you are tolerant, but why
don’t you see

48:58.317 --> 49:00.663
you’ll become the same tomorrow?”

49:00.864 --> 49:06.398
Because your brain is working, now the tape
is going back.

49:07.113 --> 49:10.654
And when they get into the bus and they are
shouting at the top of their voices,

49:10.855 --> 49:12.787
and everybody thinks that there’s somebody
worthful

49:12.988 --> 49:16.523
and it’s all right, doesn’t matter,
take it.

49:17.817 --> 49:25.209
And this is what is going to happen to us
also. If you start thinking.

49:25.410 --> 49:28.703
Now, what about your machine of thinking?
You are already -

49:28.904 --> 49:32.598
Frenchy character is there.

49:32.815 --> 49:34.889
What more you want?

49:35.090 --> 49:39.099
Still on, thinking, eh? Doesn’t stop.

49:39.300 --> 49:41.977
Yogi: It’s like a reporter ... [indistinct]
Shri Mataji: Eh?

49:42.178 --> 49:46.289
Yogi: It’s like a reporter ... [indistinct]
Shri Mataji: And what is he reporting?

49:46.490 --> 49:50.452
Yogi: So everything – I don’t know.
Constant bad news.

49:50.653 --> 49:53.662
Shri Mataji: Talking?

49:56.584 --> 49:59.498
Come here. Let’s fix him up. Come along.

49:59.699 --> 50:04.609
Sit down. Sit face that side. Come along.

50:18.244 --> 50:21.491
You forgive everyone,

50:21.692 --> 50:25.522
forgive your mother, forgive your father,
forgive all of them.

50:25.723 --> 50:29.391
Just forgive, say, “I forgive.”

50:30.317 --> 50:33.992
Go on saying, “Mother, I forgive everyone.”

50:57.071 --> 51:02.695
It’s all right. Don’t know how to take it
out? In hot water.

51:09.160 --> 51:13.180
Better?

51:14.668 --> 51:19.545
Better or not? You are not thinking.

51:19.746 --> 51:23.586
Are you thinking now? No.

51:45.291 --> 51:49.733
Yes. Better. What are you doing for your
head?

51:49.934 --> 51:55.500
Are you using any… [Indistinct]?

52:12.573 --> 52:15.891
Bring some lemon.

52:28.306 --> 52:31.935
How are you? Dawn?
Dawn: Yes, Mother.

52:32.136 --> 52:35.240
Shri Mataji: All right?
Dawn: Yes, Mother.

52:35.911 --> 52:39.779
Shri Mataji: [Hindi]

52:45.199 --> 52:49.389
Ah, I liked your letter very much.
Beautiful.

52:49.590 --> 52:53.436
It was such a light for Me, I was very
happy.

52:53.637 --> 52:56.773
Now, let Me have.

52:57.590 --> 53:03.984
It’s already […] so dead, how can it suck
another dead?

53:07.465 --> 53:12.545
You have to have a fresh, you see? Has
to be fresh.

53:16.495 --> 53:19.459
Sucking all right.

53:22.207 --> 53:26.242
It’s better. All right?

53:47.150 --> 53:49.609
Better now?

54:14.960 --> 54:22.471
You see, you slept well with that, you
know? Don’t worry.

54:23.995 --> 54:27.113
Something under his head.

54:27.314 --> 54:33.292
[Hindi conversation with Indian lady]

54:44.096 --> 54:48.979
Tell Me, who’ll have it? They would have
seen it.

54:56.441 --> 55:00.785
Can you bring some… (Hindi).

55:02.627 --> 55:05.349
Today we were very lucky, I must say.

55:05.557 --> 55:08.238
You should see the sari, it’s so wonderful.

55:08.439 --> 55:13.887
She gave us forty-two pounds less, can
you imagine, for the sari?

55:15.189 --> 55:17.432
Such a beautiful one you can’t imagine.

55:17.633 --> 55:21.075
I wanted because this Puja has been done
here,

55:21.284 --> 55:26.458
and it will be seen all over, and I wanted
to get a good sari.

55:26.659 --> 55:29.028
In any case your name should not be bad.

55:29.229 --> 55:31.207
And she reduced forty-two pounds from
the sari,

55:31.408 --> 55:38.223
can you imagine, how things work out.

55:38.424 --> 55:44.544
I’ll send it with Harry, or someone.
Tomorrow you can see it.

55:44.745 --> 55:48.567
How are you now, better? You?
[Person: Yes]

55:48.768 --> 55:57.551
She is all right. He is a very happy
person, that’s the main thing is.

55:57.759 --> 56:00.848
You have to be a cheerful and a happy
person.

56:01.049 --> 56:05.962
If you are an irritable person, you can
never feel all right.

56:16.450 --> 56:19.431
How many are cheerful?

56:19.632 --> 56:24.892
Count your blessings. The best way to be
happy is to count your blessings.

56:25.100 --> 56:31.649
Count them. How much God has given you.
First of all, your realization.

56:33.845 --> 56:36.495
Count your blessings.

56:40.679 --> 56:45.290
Then you’ll be cheerful. Thank God.
Thanksgiving is not there.

56:45.491 --> 56:49.394
If you start thanking Me, it will be
a good idea.

56:49.595 --> 56:55.329
Just start thinking what has happened
to you. Just thanksgiving.

56:55.530 --> 56:58.572
It will make you very cheerful and happy.

56:58.773 --> 57:03.284
Just start thinking about what you were
and what you are, just start.

57:03.485 --> 57:07.644
Thanksgiving is not there. Know it
for sure.

57:09.773 --> 57:13.777
That’s the first thing one should do is
to thank.

57:15.414 --> 57:18.659
All your gloom will vanish.

57:20.023 --> 57:22.925
You’ll feel very happy.

57:32.279 --> 57:34.109
Better?
Yogi: Yes.

57:34.310 --> 57:38.064
Shri Mataji: Do you thank or not?
Yogi: Thank You, Mother.

57:57.684 --> 58:03.814
Shri Mataji: [Hindi]

58:30.681 --> 58:34.994
So, you will have to keep some days when
you will have to travel to these places.

58:35.195 --> 58:40.714
Paris, you will have to go to Paris, and
you will have to go to…

58:40.915 --> 58:47.753
Yogi: Lille. Shri Mataji: Lille [Yogi:
“And Nice”] Nice, and maybe Madrid,

58:47.954 --> 58:51.659
because these people have spread out
very much.

58:53.703 --> 58:56.713
People are selling their furnitures and
everything.

58:56.929 --> 59:00.205
They are selling in Lille,

59:00.406 --> 59:06.167
all their furniture they are selling them
to horrible things.

59:25.240 --> 59:29.228
There’s a very sweet child, just like
Bumble,

59:29.429 --> 59:32.845
with these two persons. She is just
a saint,

59:33.046 --> 59:35.993
she is so much opposing and all that.
Now she is all right.

59:36.194 --> 59:41.447
Estrella is her name. Josette is the name
of the lady.

59:41.655 --> 59:47.972
I don’t remember the name of the man,
but he is a very great musician.

59:49.554 --> 59:58.423
You met a very big pianist who was, who
plays in the churches.

59:58.624 --> 01:00:06.860
He got his realization too, in Nice.

01:00:08.633 --> 01:00:11.993
You found a very nice person in Nice,
his name is Philippe.

01:00:12.194 --> 01:00:14.066
And his mother and his whole family came,

01:00:14.267 --> 01:00:17.181
father and sister, and everybody got
realization.

01:00:17.382 --> 01:00:19.379
He is willing to call people at his
residence.

01:00:19.580 --> 01:00:22.245
We have to send books and things there.

01:00:22.446 --> 01:00:25.494
You had sent some books to My house,
I did not know.

01:00:25.695 --> 01:00:27.939
I didn’t take them with Me.

01:00:28.140 --> 01:00:33.462
But now I think we’ll have to take some
books to Germany, perhaps we’ll do.

01:00:33.663 --> 01:00:36.869
And we need some more papers and
photographs I think,

01:00:37.070 --> 01:00:42.894
Gregoire might do it himself. He sent Me
today the report.

01:00:43.095 --> 01:00:48.923
Are you better now? Yes? How are you?

01:00:49.422 --> 01:00:54.488
Right Vishuddhi? It’s better, isn’t it?

01:00:54.689 --> 01:00:59.032
What do you say?
Man: I’m feeling better.

01:01:07.306 --> 01:01:13.899
Shri Mataji: You must have lot of sugar,
lot of it.

01:01:14.703 --> 01:01:17.814
Eh? Sugar, take sugar. Anything will do.

01:01:18.015 --> 01:01:21.050
Any sugar will do for you.

01:01:24.437 --> 01:01:29.439
Rice, sugar, bread…
