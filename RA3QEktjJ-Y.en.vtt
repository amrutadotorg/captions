00:06.840 --> 00:13.260
So "Sahaja Yoga" means
spontaneous union with the Divine.

00:13.260 --> 00:15.780
"Saha" is with, "ja" is born,

00:16.440 --> 00:21.780
that is spontaneous, born with you: everybody
has a right to get this union with the Divine.

00:21.780 --> 00:26.040
The another meaning of the word "Divine" is that

00:28.620 --> 00:38.100
the power of God that is all-pervading, which
does all the living work – like transformation

00:38.100 --> 00:44.460
of flower into fruit, different seasons –
all that is living is done by this power.

00:44.460 --> 00:47.520
And this Divine, you have to become one.

00:47.520 --> 00:51.369
You have to feel it on your fingertips.

00:51.369 --> 01:01.440
This yoga also means the deftness, means also
the complete knowledge about this divine power,

01:01.440 --> 01:06.420
how to handle it, how to work
it out and how to use it.

01:06.420 --> 01:11.656
By awakening of this kundalini, as a
by-product you get your physical health.

01:11.879 --> 01:18.000
I've said many a times that cancer cannot be cured
by anything else but by the kundalini awakening.

01:18.000 --> 01:23.460
Yesterday I explained to you how cancer is
caused, and how kundalini clears it out.

01:24.060 --> 01:29.280
Most of your diseases come because the
centers are out of gear, they have broken

01:29.280 --> 01:35.280
their relationship with the whole, or maybe
that there's something lacking in the centers.

01:35.280 --> 01:40.680
When the kundalini rises she only
nourishes them so well that with that

01:40.680 --> 01:46.436
nourishment all these center, your mental,
physical, emotional centers get completely

01:46.800 --> 01:53.400
satisfied and fulfilled, and they become healthy.

01:53.400 --> 02:00.300
With that you get good health, good
mind and good balanced emotional life.

02:01.020 --> 02:05.160
But last of all, when she crosses this limit,

02:05.700 --> 02:11.100
this is the place
where resides the God Almighty.

02:11.100 --> 02:13.380
Now, I'm saying again that
you are not to believe Me,

02:13.380 --> 02:15.660
because people don't believe
in God also these days.

02:15.660 --> 02:21.300
So I say that this is the place of
God Almighty on top of your head,

02:21.300 --> 02:26.760
but He is reflected in your heart as Spirit;
and as soon as the kundalini touches that seat,

02:28.500 --> 02:35.640
the hands start flowing with
cool breeze in the hand.

02:35.640 --> 02:40.680
First you feel the cool breeze of your
own kundalini coming up and then the

02:40.680 --> 02:46.560
grace starts flowing through you, and you feel
the grace in your hand as cool breeze flowing.

02:46.560 --> 02:47.820
So it happens.

02:47.820 --> 02:51.300
Once it happens you have to
establish yourself a little bit,

02:51.300 --> 02:54.780
you have to understand it, what it
is and how to keep it established.

02:54.780 --> 02:58.920
It takes at the most for some people only
one day but some people a month or so,

02:58.920 --> 03:01.697
and then you become the master.

03:01.860 --> 03:07.080
You become a different personality, you
become so powerful and so compassionate;

03:07.080 --> 03:10.740
very compassionate and very
powerful like Christ, you see.

03:11.280 --> 03:16.920
When people were trying to throw stones
at Mary Magdalene – she was a prostitute,

03:16.920 --> 03:18.300
and He stood against it.

03:18.300 --> 03:24.780
He had nothing to do with prostitutes as such,
but He stood against all the people and He said,

03:24.780 --> 03:31.140
"Now those who have not committed any sin can
throw the stones at Me." And nobody would do it,

03:31.140 --> 03:34.680
because He's such a powerful,
compassionate person.

03:34.680 --> 03:39.600
And that's what it is, you become
a person identified with truth.

03:39.600 --> 03:45.060
You are not afraid of anyone, you always tell
the truth and will tell with great power.

03:45.060 --> 03:51.660
Like you had a great poet like William Blake, who
has said about these modern times that at this

03:51.660 --> 03:59.280
time the men of God – means the people who are
seeking God or who are believing in God – will

03:59.820 --> 04:03.960
become prophets and they'll have
power to make others prophet.

04:03.960 --> 04:06.180
This is exactly what Sahaja Yoga does,

04:06.180 --> 04:10.620
that you get your realization and you
start giving realization to another.

04:10.620 --> 04:15.360
Like an enlightened light can enlighten
another light which is not enlightened,

04:15.360 --> 04:18.840
and then that enlightened light
can enlighten many other lights.

04:18.840 --> 04:20.100
Is simple as that.

04:20.100 --> 04:23.040
There's nothing to take or
give, it's just a catalyst,

04:23.040 --> 04:28.380
that you enlighten another light and
that person enlightens another light.

04:28.380 --> 04:31.440
So there is no obligation, there's nothing give

04:31.440 --> 04:35.400
and take, but it's just a simple
happening that you can understand.

04:35.483 --> 04:39.900
This Dr. Warren himself has given
realization to thousands of people.

04:39.900 --> 04:44.100
Even in Madras I could not go, I sent him and
he gave realization to three hundred people.

04:44.100 --> 04:48.360
Like in India we have somebody who has
given realization to ten thousand people.

04:48.360 --> 04:49.200
It's a fact.

04:49.200 --> 04:51.000
And you can verify it.

04:51.000 --> 04:55.020
When you yourself get your realization
you'll be surprised that you can give

04:55.020 --> 04:57.600
realization to people and you can cure them.

04:57.600 --> 05:00.120
You can give them peace and bliss of God.

05:00.120 --> 05:04.440
Then at that time you become
collectively conscious;

05:04.440 --> 05:06.780
you become part and parcel of the whole.

05:06.780 --> 05:12.240
Like many people had the catch yesterday on the
Vishuddhi Chakra – because of certain reasons,

05:12.240 --> 05:17.040
some troubles, some had spondylitis, some had
something – and they couldn't cross this thing.

05:17.040 --> 05:19.740
Only they had to say three times, "Mother,

05:19.740 --> 05:23.820
I am the part and parcel of the whole,"
and they started feeling the cool breeze.

05:23.820 --> 05:25.620
It's so simple as that.

05:25.620 --> 05:28.860
And they started feeling the cool breeze,
because they were obstructed here.

05:28.860 --> 05:35.220
So it's very simple methods which even a child
can do, which you can do is there, and I hope

05:35.220 --> 05:41.880
today in this place which is so beautiful,
Bath, we will all receive this realization.

05:42.660 --> 05:44.659
May God bless you all.
