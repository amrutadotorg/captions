00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:13.260
So "Sahaja Yoga" means&nbsp;
spontaneous union with the Divine.

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.780
"Saha" is with, "ja" is born,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.780
that is spontaneous, born with you: everybody&nbsp;
has a right to get this union with the Divine.

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:26.040
The another meaning of the word "Divine" is that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:38.100
the power of God that is all-pervading, which&nbsp;
does all the living work – like transformation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.460
of flower into fruit, different seasons –&nbsp;
all that is living is done by this power.

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.520
And this Divine, you have to become one.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.369
You have to feel it on your fingertips.

00:00:51.369 --> 00:01:01.440
This yoga also means the deftness, means also&nbsp;
the complete knowledge about this divine power,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.420
how to handle it, how to work&nbsp;
it out and how to use it.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.656
By awakening of this kundalini, as a&nbsp;
by-product you get your physical health.

00:01:11.879 --> 00:01:18.000
I've said many a times that cancer cannot be cured&nbsp;
by anything else but by the kundalini awakening.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.460
Yesterday I explained to you how cancer is&nbsp;
caused, and how kundalini clears it out.

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.280
Most of your diseases come because the&nbsp;
centers are out of gear, they have broken&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.280
their relationship with the whole, or maybe&nbsp;
that there's something lacking in the centers.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.680
When the kundalini rises she only&nbsp;
nourishes them so well that with that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.436
nourishment all these center, your mental,&nbsp;
physical, emotional centers get completely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:53.400
satisfied and fulfilled, and they become healthy.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:02:00.300
With that you get good health, good&nbsp;
mind and good balanced emotional life.

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.160
But last of all, when she crosses this limit,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:11.100
this is the place&nbsp;
where resides the God Almighty.

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.380
Now, I'm saying again that&nbsp;
you are not to believe Me,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.660
because people don't believe&nbsp;
in God also these days.

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:21.300
So I say that this is the place of&nbsp;
God Almighty on top of your head,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.760
but He is reflected in your heart as Spirit;&nbsp;
and as soon as the kundalini touches that seat,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:35.640
the hands start flowing with&nbsp;
cool breeze in the hand.

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.680
First you feel the cool breeze of your&nbsp;
own kundalini coming up and then the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:46.560
grace starts flowing through you, and you feel&nbsp;
the grace in your hand as cool breeze flowing.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.820
So it happens.

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.300
Once it happens you have to&nbsp;
establish yourself a little bit,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.780
you have to understand it, what it&nbsp;
is and how to keep it established.

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.920
It takes at the most for some people only&nbsp;
one day but some people a month or so,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.697
and then you become the master.

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:07.080
You become a different personality, you&nbsp;
become so powerful and so compassionate;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.740
very compassionate and very&nbsp;
powerful like Christ, you see.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.920
When people were trying to throw stones&nbsp;
at Mary Magdalene – she was a prostitute,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.300
and He stood against it.

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:24.780
He had nothing to do with prostitutes as such,&nbsp;
but He stood against all the people and He said,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:31.140
"Now those who have not committed any sin can&nbsp;
throw the stones at Me." And nobody would do it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.680
because He's such a powerful,&nbsp;
compassionate person.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.600
And that's what it is, you become&nbsp;
a person identified with truth.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:45.060
You are not afraid of anyone, you always tell&nbsp;
the truth and will tell with great power.

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:51.660
Like you had a great poet like William Blake, who&nbsp;
has said about these modern times that at this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:59.280
time the men of God – means the people who are&nbsp;
seeking God or who are believing in God – will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.960
become prophets and they'll have&nbsp;
power to make others prophet.

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.180
This is exactly what Sahaja Yoga does,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.620
that you get your realization and you&nbsp;
start giving realization to another.

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:15.360
Like an enlightened light can enlighten&nbsp;
another light which is not enlightened,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.840
and then that enlightened light&nbsp;
can enlighten many other lights.

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.100
Is simple as that.

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.040
There's nothing to take or&nbsp;
give, it's just a catalyst,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:28.380
that you enlighten another light and&nbsp;
that person enlightens another light.

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.440
So there is no obligation, there's nothing give&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.400
and take, but it's just a simple&nbsp;
happening that you can understand.

00:04:35.483 --> 00:04:39.900
This Dr. Warren himself has given&nbsp;
realization to thousands of people.

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.100
Even in Madras I could not go, I sent him and&nbsp;
he gave realization to three hundred people.

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:48.360
Like in India we have somebody who has&nbsp;
given realization to ten thousand people.

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.200
It's a fact.

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.000
And you can verify it.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.020
When you yourself get your realization&nbsp;
you'll be surprised that you can give&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.600
realization to people and you can cure them.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.120
You can give them peace and bliss of God.

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:04.440
Then at that time you become&nbsp;
collectively conscious;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.780
you become part and parcel of the whole.

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:12.240
Like many people had the catch yesterday on the&nbsp;
Vishuddhi Chakra – because of certain reasons,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:17.040
some troubles, some had spondylitis, some had&nbsp;
something – and they couldn't cross this thing.

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.740
Only they had to say three times, "Mother,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:23.820
I am the part and parcel of the whole,"&nbsp;
and they started feeling the cool breeze.

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:25.620
It's so simple as that.

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.860
And they started feeling the cool breeze,&nbsp;
because they were obstructed here.

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:35.220
So it's very simple methods which even a child&nbsp;
can do, which you can do is there, and I hope&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:41.880
today in this place which is so beautiful,&nbsp;
Bath, we will all receive this realization.

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.659
May God bless you all.
