WEBVTT

00:05.601 --> 00:07.760
Now, any questions?

00:07.970 --> 00:11.120
Seeker: Mother, I’d just like to say,
“I love You!”

00:11.321 --> 00:17.575
Shri Mataji: What’s it? Seeker: And I
would like to sometime tonight

00:17.776 --> 00:21.206
take the rest of the pictures because I’m
not sure the others still have.

00:21.407 --> 00:26.810
And this is my important question: how
can I still my thoughts?

00:27.011 --> 00:30.391
Shri Mataji: What did he say?
Seeker: How can I still my thoughts?

00:30.592 --> 00:33.811
Warren: He wants to know how can he
still his thoughts. Shri Mataji: Eh?

00:34.025 --> 00:37.702
Warren: How can he still his thoughts.
Shri Mataji: How can he? What?

00:37.903 --> 00:41.529
Warren: Make himself thoughtless.

00:41.730 --> 00:43.891
Shri Mataji: You just say Lord’s Prayer.

00:44.092 --> 00:47.769
Now, before my photograph. All right?
It will work out.

00:47.970 --> 00:53.467
Lord’s Prayer is the entry, it’s
the entry, no doubt.

00:53.668 --> 00:59.169
Warren: There’s a little announcement
concerning all of you –

00:59.370 --> 01:04.956
there is a photograph of Mataji which
is available from Tracy,

01:05.157 --> 01:08.358
who is sitting over there, which you
can buy,

01:08.559 --> 01:13.869
it’s a very good quality black and white
photograph, and she has a few tonight.

01:14.070 --> 01:16.621
Christine will have a stock of those
photographs.

01:16.837 --> 01:21.216
There is also a book called “The Advent”,
which a few people already received,

01:21.417 --> 01:25.170
about Mataji’s advent and about Sahaja
Yoga,

01:25.371 --> 01:31.855
which you’ll be able to buy once you settle
into Sahaja Yoga.

01:33.191 --> 01:37.719
Don’t forget that Christine is here,
Herman is here,

01:37.920 --> 01:42.666
with his home which he has offered
as a meeting place for Sahaja Yoga,

01:42.867 --> 01:49.525
You should all get together after Mother’s
gone, form a nucleus,

01:49.726 --> 01:54.763
get yourselves strong, and then begin
to give realisation to others,

01:54.964 --> 01:58.546
then you yourself will be able to establish
centres in your own district,

01:58.747 --> 02:02.286
maybe even go out of New York. This is
how it’s going to grow.

02:02.487 --> 02:05.452
As Mother said, “If there’s one candle
which becomes enlightened,

02:05.653 --> 02:09.251
it can enlighten another.” You’ve got
a tremendous responsibility.

02:09.452 --> 02:14.498
Christine is here to assist you, Tracy
is going to the West Coast,

02:14.699 --> 02:17.738
and this is how it’s going to spread
through America.

02:17.984 --> 02:20.579
Take it in your both hands.
Shri Mataji: And Steve is in Boston.

02:20.780 --> 02:24.769
Steve and Christine are in Boston.
Stand up so they can see.

02:24.970 --> 02:28.264
Warren: Steve and Christine are in Boston.
Christine? Let everybody see you,

02:28.465 --> 02:32.000
so that you can get the names and
addresses and any contacts,

02:32.201 --> 02:36.313
and Tracy will be in the West Coast
if you know anybody over there.

02:36.514 --> 02:39.993
Shri Mataji: And at Herman’s place.
Herman, can you stand up?

02:40.194 --> 02:42.170
I’m going to see his place tomorrow.
Warren: Where is he?

02:42.371 --> 02:45.060
Shri Mataji: Where is he gone? Warren:
He couldn’t get here tonight, Mother.

02:45.261 --> 02:47.129
He had to work tonight. Shri Mataji: Ah,
he had to work tonight, yes.

02:47.330 --> 02:50.143
He came here a few times.

02:51.871 --> 02:55.225
Lady seeker: You mentioned on the right
side is the superego,

02:55.425 --> 02:58.461
on the right side of the brain.

02:58.662 --> 03:01.548
Warren: You mentioned that the superego
is on the right side, instead…

03:01.749 --> 03:06.126
Shri Mataji: No, I mean in the sense that
it moves like this, you see?

03:06.327 --> 03:11.248
And like this. Now, this way. But more
super goes on the right side,

03:11.448 --> 03:14.177
it presses more on the right side.

03:14.378 --> 03:19.636
But the movement is like, you see, the thing
is, the division is like this, all right?

03:19.837 --> 03:25.071
Question: What type of thinking would
increase the activity on this side -

03:25.286 --> 03:28.814
would increase the superego?

03:29.015 --> 03:34.086
Warren: What sort of thinking would
increase the activity of the superego?

03:34.287 --> 03:37.738
Shri Mataji: No no no no no no. Warren:
What sort of thinking, she is asking.

03:37.970 --> 03:39.662
Shri Mataji: What sort of thinking.
Question: Is that too much thinking…?

03:39.863 --> 03:43.115
Shri Mataji: No, you don’t think now.
You see, don’t think.

03:43.316 --> 03:46.611
You have to become thoughtlessly aware,
first of all, don’t think.

03:46.812 --> 03:50.170
But once you are realised, once you are
realised,

03:50.371 --> 03:54.618
whatever you think happens.

03:54.819 --> 04:00.522
Whatever you want happens, because
your attention is enlightened.

04:00.723 --> 04:06.179
Your attention is enlightened. Like I went
to Orléans.

04:06.380 --> 04:08.960
There was a lady who was suffering
from breast-cancer.

04:09.161 --> 04:11.654
And I cured her, she was all right.

04:11.855 --> 04:15.934
And I was then in Switzerland, recently,
about after a year,

04:16.135 --> 04:19.776
and somebody came from Orléans - Robert -
and he told me that

04:19.977 --> 04:22.766
“Mother, she is all right and she is
a sahaja yogini.

04:22.967 --> 04:27.411
But now she has got a terrible trouble
in her kidney

04:27.612 --> 04:31.793
and she’s got terrible pain and she is
in the hospital”.

04:31.994 --> 04:38.250
And as soon as he told me, the pain
stopped, and the stone came out.

04:38.451 --> 04:43.456
And since that day she is all right. So,
it just works that moment.

04:43.673 --> 04:47.135
Whatever you ask for, will work, whatever
you want for, it will work,

04:47.336 --> 04:52.362
because you become collectively conscious
and the collective Being helps you.

04:52.563 --> 04:59.448
Apart from that all the angels - like Saint
Michael, who resides on this side.

04:59.656 --> 05:04.151
His birthday was yesterday, day before
yesterday,

05:04.352 --> 05:08.870
they celebrated Saint Michael’s birthday.
Is left side here.

05:09.071 --> 05:11.803
And Saint Gabriel is on the right-hand
side.

05:12.004 --> 05:15.577
And all their armies are with you, they
all look after you.

05:15.778 --> 05:20.215
For example, a realised soul, established
realised soul, is travelling by a train,

05:20.416 --> 05:23.793
there will not be an accident. If there
is an accident all will be saved.

05:23.994 --> 05:26.388
They are saved in such miraculous manners.

05:26.589 --> 05:29.083
I mean, there are thousand and one things
you will see

05:29.284 --> 05:33.758
that you’ll be amazed how you are helped.

05:34.103 --> 05:39.828
So, you don’t think, leave it to God!
He thinks for you.

05:41.865 --> 05:48.736
Question: Yes. How does one know that
which someone who is realised?

05:48.937 --> 05:52.871
I read a lot about Rajneesh

05:53.072 --> 06:00.742
and I met Swami Vishnudevananda and
I’m very impressed by both of them.

06:00.943 --> 06:05.359
And how do I know that You…?

06:05.560 --> 06:09.657
I was impressed by them as I am impressed
by You. Shri Mataji: What he’s saying?

06:09.865 --> 06:15.306
Warren: How do you know whether somebody
is a realised soul, is a true teacher?

06:15.507 --> 06:18.739
Shri Mataji: You see, unless and until you
are your Spirit, you cannot.

06:18.940 --> 06:22.695
You have to become your Spirit. Then
you get your vibratory awareness.

06:22.896 --> 06:24.864
You get the cool breeze coming into you.

06:25.065 --> 06:28.281
Now, this cool breeze is nothing but is
the all-pervading power,

06:28.482 --> 06:31.196
which you start feeling on your –

06:31.397 --> 06:33.992
you have come for the first time?
That’s why.

06:34.193 --> 06:37.161
This question is justified, but I’ve told
about this.

06:37.362 --> 06:40.078
Then you start feeling the all-pervading
power, all right?

06:40.279 --> 06:43.191
Then you can also feel whether a person
is realised or not.

06:43.392 --> 06:47.190
But if you are not the Spirit, you can know
even logically,

06:47.391 --> 06:52.822
for a person who is a realised soul, never
can take anything from you.

06:53.031 --> 06:57.104
He cannot be a parasite. He doesn’t
live by your earnings.

06:57.305 --> 07:01.536
Such a person - it’s all right, you can
pay for this hall, all right.

07:01.737 --> 07:05.160
You can pay for the travelling of
the person, it’s all right.

07:05.361 --> 07:07.752
But you cannot live on the money of other
people.

07:07.952 --> 07:11.677
Because you want supposing somebody
to come, you can pay for the taxi to come,

07:11.878 --> 07:13.710
that’s a different point.

07:13.911 --> 07:19.803
Now, such a person will have a temperament
which will be very detached,

07:20.004 --> 07:22.181
not bothered, is not a money-minded person,

07:22.381 --> 07:25.509
is not a worldly person sort of a thing,

07:25.710 --> 07:28.925
and is not bothered by mundane things
of life.

07:29.126 --> 07:33.436
Such a person leads a holy life. Has
to be a chaste person.

07:33.637 --> 07:37.441
Cannot have married his own secretary
or something like that

07:37.642 --> 07:43.178
and carry… become a yunky or something
and behave like a stupid person.

07:43.378 --> 07:46.799
You see, cannot do. All such people
cannot be realised souls,

07:47.000 --> 07:49.316
one should who - cannot ask for Rolls
Royces.

07:49.527 --> 07:53.362
I mean, to such a person Rolls Royce is
the same as a bullock cart,

07:53.563 --> 07:57.121
what is the difference? I mean, you
can sleep on the road,

07:57.322 --> 08:02.150
you can sleep in the palace, anywhere,
makes no difference to such a person.

08:02.351 --> 08:06.829
This person can be rich by birth, could
be poor, makes no difference.

08:07.029 --> 08:10.947
He has that kind of a body that he can
adjust himself

08:11.148 --> 08:14.565
to any kind of life that is there.

08:14.766 --> 08:19.594
So many things can be seen; and he
cannot take any effort,

08:19.798 --> 08:23.799
he should not make you do any effort,
it is he who works.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.088
I have to work, you don’t have to work.

08:26.288 --> 08:30.106
The person who knows swimming, has
to work hard to save the person.

08:30.307 --> 08:34.683
Or the person who is to be saved has to
work hard? I mean, it’s a simple logic.

08:34.883 --> 08:37.503
Simple logic. If they tell you to stand
on your head,

08:37.712 --> 08:42.039
you tell them that “Are you going to save
us or we are going to save ourselves?”

08:42.240 --> 08:47.809
Those who have to save have to work
hard, very hard.

08:50.437 --> 08:53.822
Warren: Yes. Shri Mataji: They have
come for the first time.

08:54.023 --> 08:56.645
And I know that you’ll ask some questions
which was... Seeker: No question.

08:56.846 --> 08:58.855
Shri Mataji: All right. Seeker: I have
no question; I want to just say something.

08:59.056 --> 09:00.884
Shri Mataji: All right. Now tell me.
Seeker: I have no questions

09:01.085 --> 09:05.756
because I realise that questions very
often create resistance.

09:05.957 --> 09:10.405
I must tell You that during Your general
lecture

09:10.605 --> 09:16.018
I felt as if You were speaking to me.
Shri Mataji: Correct.

09:16.219 --> 09:19.506
I know you are a very great seeker;
I could see that.

09:19.707 --> 09:23.241
Seeker: And I want to let it sink in,
that’s all I want to say, it was beautiful.

09:23.442 --> 09:26.792
Shri Mataji: What he’s saying?
Warren: He is just speaking, saying

09:26.993 --> 09:29.773
how much, when he was listening to You…
Shri Mataji: I know, I know, I saw you,

09:29.974 --> 09:33.274
I saw you, I could make it out, I was
very happy to see you there.

09:33.475 --> 09:35.932
Very much happy to see you there. I know,
I know,

09:36.133 --> 09:38.534
and there are so many like you in this
country,

09:38.735 --> 09:40.487
which you have to seek and find them out.

09:40.688 --> 09:44.083
There are so many, they are just – I don’t
know why they are not here,

09:44.284 --> 09:46.885
I was expecting them, like you, today.

09:47.086 --> 09:50.851
I was expecting you earlier.

09:51.122 --> 09:54.486
All right, what is the…

09:56.465 --> 10:03.264
Seeker: I read this article in a newspaper
one week ago, about biological warfare

10:03.472 --> 10:08.722
which is taking place in Cambodia. Do You
know what that means, biological warfare?

10:08.931 --> 10:12.322
Warren: She read an article in the
newspaper about biological warfare

10:12.523 --> 10:16.740
which is taking place in Cambodia.
Biological warfare.

10:16.948 --> 10:21.569
Seeker: It means like, You know, they have
organisms that, they use organisms

10:21.770 --> 10:26.953
which emit a toxin to kill people.

10:27.154 --> 10:31.406
Warren: They use organisms which emit
toxins which kill people.

10:31.607 --> 10:35.212
Seeker: And I am wondering if this is
the beginning of the end.

10:35.413 --> 10:39.450
Warren: She says, ‘Is this the beginning
of the end?’

10:42.783 --> 10:47.389
Shri Mataji: You see, these things people
do because they hate.

10:47.590 --> 10:52.613
They hate, they have never known the power
of love.

10:52.814 --> 10:55.955
They have only known the power of hatred.

10:56.156 --> 11:00.196
Power of love is so powerful, so dynamic.

11:00.397 --> 11:04.044
You can win them over. It’s nice you
brought it to my attention.

11:04.245 --> 11:08.289
My attention is on Cambodia. It was
on Vietnam, it was on Cambodia,

11:08.490 --> 11:10.899
my chitta, my attention. One has to work
it out.

11:11.100 --> 11:14.338
But now, first of all, you should know
of this country,

11:14.539 --> 11:18.755
which is going to be destroyed from within.

11:18.956 --> 11:22.553
You don’t know how much these gurus
have destroyed you.

11:22.754 --> 11:30.570
This is a very bad, very, very bad
atmosphere.

11:30.771 --> 11:33.561
Children can be killed just like that,
without even your knowledge.

11:33.762 --> 11:37.098
People can be killed just like that, this
black magic if it takes over,

11:37.299 --> 11:41.032
it can kill you just like that, you will
not know.

11:41.233 --> 11:45.226
The spirits can work out black magic
and be very effective.

11:45.427 --> 11:49.248
They can make people commit suicide,
thousands of them can commit suicide.

11:49.449 --> 11:52.579
I mean, this is a very much more dangerous
thing than that biological stuff

11:52.779 --> 11:55.463
which you saw much in the open, but
this is secret,

11:55.663 --> 11:58.576
and you have to be careful. Anything
can happen in this country.

11:58.777 --> 12:01.783
Apart from that, all of these people you
have allowed them to come here,

12:01.984 --> 12:06.674
these are anti-Christ. And they have
brought all the bad vibrations there.

12:06.875 --> 12:10.763
Such bad vibrations that the whole country
can go into a big turmoil,

12:10.971 --> 12:15.927
I mean, there could be a very big upheaval,
earthquakes, can be anything.

12:16.127 --> 12:18.484
Horrible things can happen to this country,
I mean, you are perched

12:18.685 --> 12:23.848
on a very, very serious situation, which
you should pay attention to.

12:24.049 --> 12:28.321
Don’t pay attention to Cambodia. It’s not
so difficult. It can be controlled.

12:28.522 --> 12:31.267
It’s more in this country it’s a problem.

12:31.478 --> 12:33.185
Warren: Let’s not ask any more political
questions.

12:33.385 --> 12:34.827
Shri Mataji: One more, all right, let her
ask, one more.

12:35.028 --> 12:37.615
Warren: Just about the spiritual side.
Shri Mataji: All right.

12:37.816 --> 12:41.284
Seeker: I feel very confident about
the spiritual side so…

12:41.485 --> 12:45.223
Shri Mataji: About what? Seeker: So I don’t
need to ask about that.

12:45.424 --> 12:47.165
Shri Mataji (aside): About what? Seeker:
But this I’ve never heard, You see,

12:47.427 --> 12:49.080
that which he says now,

12:49.281 --> 12:52.806
I don’t understand what he means
by secret gurus.

12:53.007 --> 12:55.223
Shri Mataji: You see, I’ll tell you what
it means.

12:55.439 --> 12:57.907
There is a psychological attack, you see?

12:58.108 --> 13:00.655
On the psyche of the people, through
the spirits.

13:00.856 --> 13:03.696
And which is a very serious thing, of which
you have no idea,

13:03.897 --> 13:06.932
you are very naïve people, absolutely
naïve, you have no idea.

13:07.133 --> 13:10.056
Even you are playing with parapsychology,
is a very dangerous thing.

13:10.257 --> 13:13.711
Parapsychology – Russians are like that,
extremely naïve.

13:13.912 --> 13:17.610
They are getting into this psychological
trauma, complete psychological –

13:17.811 --> 13:21.464
of which you are not aware! You are not
at all aware of it.

13:21.665 --> 13:26.546
And that is the attack is going to come
on you. Very seriously, it’s possible.

13:26.747 --> 13:31.087
Now only imagine, these people are having
fifty thousand people, imagine.

13:31.288 --> 13:34.616
Madly in love with the anti-Christ – he is
a born anti-Christ,

13:34.817 --> 13:37.095
he is the anti-Christ, who is here,
stationed here.

13:37.296 --> 13:41.288
Seeker: Who are You referring to?
Shri Mataji: To this guru Maharaji.

13:41.489 --> 13:45.178
Seeker: Oh, guru Maharaji, ah yes.
Shri Mataji: So many of them.

13:45.379 --> 13:48.756
Rajneesh, you gave him place here.
Rajneesh is an anti-Christ.

13:48.957 --> 13:51.634
He is horrible, you brought him here.
He could not exist in India,

13:51.834 --> 13:54.676
he had to run away.

13:55.026 --> 13:57.905
All sorts of people you have got here,
Mahesh yogi. All of them.

13:58.106 --> 14:00.587
Seeker: Mahesh yogi also?
Shri Mataji: Horrible!

14:00.788 --> 14:02.930
He is the worst of all!
Seeker: Why?

14:03.131 --> 14:06.815
Shri Mataji: Why – because he’s destroyed
so many people. He’s given epilepsy.

14:07.016 --> 14:12.186
His director of his flying squad that he
had in – Lady: “In Switzerland” –

14:12.387 --> 14:15.638
in Scotland he had the real one
in Scotland,

14:15.839 --> 14:17.871
and the director was with Mr. Peter
Pierce.

14:18.072 --> 14:22.424
He came down to me with his epilepsy
and his wife and his daughter,

14:22.625 --> 14:26.691
and you must see what she has written
now, about what he did to her.

14:26.892 --> 14:30.060
Before coming to me she gave this interview.
I would not have allowed her to do that,

14:30.260 --> 14:36.249
but she did it before. And that’s how,
he has done it.

14:36.460 --> 14:38.663
You get into epilepsy and things like that.

14:38.882 --> 14:41.651
I mean, how will you get over your
epilepsies, you cannot cure your epilepsy,

14:41.852 --> 14:44.512
you don’t know from where it is coming,
or you don’t know the source,

14:44.713 --> 14:47.348
you don’t know how to cure yourself,
you are so naïve!

14:47.549 --> 14:50.249
And there are thousands and billions and
billions who can’t even see

14:50.449 --> 14:54.281
what’s wrong with him. You don’t even
understand anything about it.

14:54.482 --> 14:58.573
I mean, nothing, you have no idea.
Your psychology is like a child

14:58.774 --> 15:03.682
compared to the knowledge Indians have
about it, I mean, they know all about it.

15:03.883 --> 15:06.401
I mean, you may think you are very
developed. You might be developed

15:06.601 --> 15:08.526
as far as the bridges are concerned
and this and that,

15:08.734 --> 15:11.145
but as far as the human beings are
concerned, you have no idea,

15:11.346 --> 15:14.853
you are very simple people. Extremely
simple.

15:15.054 --> 15:18.436
Seeker: But Mother, I have been practising
transcendental meditation for nine years…

15:18.637 --> 15:21.239
Shri Mataji: That’s it, I know that!
Seeker: And…

15:21.440 --> 15:22.761
Shri Mataji: You get this catch (Ekadasha).
Now you will see,

15:22.961 --> 15:25.826
in your rising of the Kundalini you will
see here. Seeker: Good.

15:26.027 --> 15:30.838
Shri Mataji: All right? Seeker: I found it
to be not a negative thing in my life.

15:31.039 --> 15:32.640
Shri Mataji: You are a sweet person.
Seeker: Thank You.

15:32.841 --> 15:36.565
Shri Mataji: You are a seeker. You be
kind to yourself,

15:36.766 --> 15:40.611
kind to yourself, you are the temple
of God.

15:40.812 --> 15:44.939
Seeker: But I never liked Mahesh yogi.
Shri Mataji: That’s it!

15:45.140 --> 15:47.578
Seeker: I took his mantra, two of them.
And I…

15:47.779 --> 15:50.421
Shri Mataji: The mantra is, that’s what I
said, the mantra, you see,

15:50.627 --> 15:54.628
is a big science, at every centre there’s
a different mantra.

15:54.829 --> 15:57.366
He just gives you one mantra…
Seeker: He gave me two.

15:57.575 --> 15:59.779
Shri Mataji: And, two, you see, he gives
you… Seeker: He didn’t give it to me,

15:59.979 --> 16:02.512
I had to buy it.
Shri Mataji: Good.

16:02.721 --> 16:06.140
You see, his mantras are - if you tell
in India, they’ll laugh at you.

16:06.341 --> 16:10.223
One mantra is tinga, which means this,
showing like this is tinga.

16:10.447 --> 16:13.483
Inga – inga means the… Seeker: That’s
right. Shri Mataji: … the tail, the tail –

16:13.684 --> 16:18.001
Inga means the tail of a scorpion.
Can you imagine?

16:18.202 --> 16:23.427
Seeker: I used that one.
Shri Mataji: Now, look at that.

16:23.628 --> 16:26.565
It is no Sanskrit, nothing, it is horrible!
It means horrible!

16:26.766 --> 16:30.132
You tell anybody that, “he gave me
the mantra of inga”, Indians will laugh,

16:30.333 --> 16:34.922
if they know any Sanskrit. Even if they
know Hindi language, ordinary Hindi.

16:35.123 --> 16:39.070
Ainga: ainga means, a very bad Hindi
when somebody has to say, “I come”.

16:39.271 --> 16:41.849
Seeker: What does it mean?
Shri Mataji: It means “I come”.

16:42.050 --> 16:46.243
If you have to say, “I’m coming”, it’s
a bad Hindi language when you are –

16:46.444 --> 16:52.613
you don’t know Hindi language then
you say ainga. It’s a – it’s a joke.

16:52.814 --> 16:56.334
Seeker: What do you do with your mantra?
My – I have one too, I can’t use it,

16:56.535 --> 17:00.362
it doesn’t work with me. But it’s still
in my mind. It does nothing anyway.

17:00.563 --> 17:02.810
Shri Mataji: You throw it away.
Seeker: You see, I’ll just forget it.

17:03.011 --> 17:05.814
Shri Mataji: You forget it, that’s why the
problems you were saying and the doubts.

17:06.015 --> 17:11.080
They put the doubts. These horrible
ingas, pingas and tingas.

17:11.281 --> 17:15.077
There is no gerund like ‘ing’ in Sanskrit.

17:15.278 --> 17:19.588
No. It’s from England you must have
picked up ‘ing’, I don’t know.

17:19.789 --> 17:25.556
I don’t know from where. Oh, he’s horrid.

17:25.757 --> 17:30.706
Seeker: Good. Thank you.
Warren: Yes.

17:30.907 --> 17:36.121
Seeker: Mother, the seed words that you
use when you like, meditate on the chakras.

17:36.322 --> 17:40.484
You start meditating from the lowest up to
the top, and do you use the seed words,

17:40.685 --> 17:46.955
like lam, yam, sa. No, it’s lam…
Shri Mataji: I can’t hear her.

17:47.156 --> 17:50.201
Seeker: Oh anyhow – if you meditate –
is that all right, using the seed words?

17:50.402 --> 17:55.001
Warren: If you meditate on the chakras
using the seed, seed mantras…

17:55.202 --> 17:58.250
Shri Mataji: Just now you don’t do
all that, all right? Just now you don’t.

17:58.451 --> 18:01.150
[Seeker: Just now don’t do it].
Later on. [Seeker: Don’t do it?]

18:01.351 --> 18:05.829
Just now to establish yourself. You see
now, if you use the seed mantras,

18:06.030 --> 18:09.308
you just don’t do it just now, because
you don’t know where the Kundalini is.

18:09.509 --> 18:11.793
First of all, establish yourself.
You should know yourself,

18:11.994 --> 18:13.599
what is the problem is.

18:13.800 --> 18:16.801
Then in Sahaja Yoga we teach everything,
one by one:

18:17.002 --> 18:20.283
what chakra is catching, what mantra
is to be used,

18:20.484 --> 18:23.439
what seed mantra is to be – there is no
need now to use even seed mantras,

18:23.640 --> 18:25.836
because you have got the Kundalini
in your hands, you see,

18:26.037 --> 18:28.748
so you use the Kundalini mantras.
And that’s how.

18:28.949 --> 18:32.245
We have got mantras for everything, which
you have to learn gradually, do it.

18:32.446 --> 18:33.870
But don’t do anything on your own,

18:34.070 --> 18:37.067
because still you have to establish
yourself fully, isn’t it?

18:37.268 --> 18:39.426
Unless and until you are established, say,
unless and until

18:39.627 --> 18:43.208
you are a fully-fledged engineer, nothing
is given into your hands.

18:43.409 --> 18:47.796
So first of all, now the time of transition
is very important.

18:47.997 --> 18:51.339
First you are transformed, but
transmutation takes time.

18:51.540 --> 18:54.057
Like a caterpillar, you see, becomes
a butterfly.

18:54.258 --> 18:58.639
But it has to get rid of all the nonsense
that was with – bring with it.

18:58.857 --> 19:01.634
And that has to take place – one it has
to become a butterfly,

19:01.835 --> 19:03.687
then it knows how to do the job. All right?

19:03.888 --> 19:06.632
So the transition time you have to be
very, very careful,

19:06.833 --> 19:09.009
grow very steadily and rise.

19:09.210 --> 19:14.831
And Christine is here, and also we might
send somebody from England for her

19:15.032 --> 19:19.489
to help you, and work it out gradually,
steadily, steadily,

19:19.690 --> 19:25.081
till you achieve a position where you
understand deeply.

19:25.282 --> 19:30.968
Because all these things you forget.
Forget about this so-called knowledge.

19:31.169 --> 19:34.136
Like Shankaracharya has said,
Adi Shankaracharya,

19:34.337 --> 19:39.053
that once you get realised, even this
science looks like a child’s play.

19:39.264 --> 19:41.734
It’s all this knowledge is non-knowledge.

19:41.935 --> 19:46.890
Surdas has said, “O Lord, take away my
avidya, take away my non-knowledge.”

19:47.091 --> 19:49.703
So just forget about the bija mantras
just now,

19:49.904 --> 19:52.802
all such books on chakras you throw
them away.

19:53.003 --> 19:58.873
You have your own book of your experience.
You yourself learn it

19:59.074 --> 20:02.238
and you become the masters. Masters
of Kundalini.

20:02.439 --> 20:08.093
You have such powers as Shri Ganesha
has. You can raise the Kundalini like this.

20:08.294 --> 20:12.056
Even the great and great gurus I’ve met
in India,

20:12.257 --> 20:14.864
they are jealous of you, take it from me.

20:15.065 --> 20:17.622
They are real people, no doubt, but
they can’t understand

20:17.823 --> 20:20.362
why I have given you realisation so fast.

20:20.563 --> 20:22.612
They can’t understand, with all your
impurities,

20:22.813 --> 20:26.520
how are you raising the Kundalini when
they cannot raise it.

20:26.744 --> 20:32.451
It’s very interesting that you are made
after the pattern of Shri Ganesh,

20:32.652 --> 20:35.180
immaculate.

20:41.537 --> 20:45.819
So first establish yourself. That is
important.

20:46.384 --> 20:49.465
All right, now, those who have come
for the first time… yes, now?

20:49.666 --> 20:51.954
Seeker: I’m just curious, perhaps I have
missed what You said,

20:52.155 --> 20:57.236
but could You explain what is the Kundalini
and how can we raise it?

20:57.437 --> 21:00.111
Shri Mataji: Good idea, it’s very good!
That’s what I will tell you,

21:00.312 --> 21:03.619
that how to raise it yourself. But just
now, you see,

21:03.820 --> 21:06.046
we’ll first of all give you realisation,

21:06.247 --> 21:08.811
then you can use my photograph for some
time

21:09.012 --> 21:11.000
for raising the Kundalini of other people –

21:11.201 --> 21:15.634
you put them before the photograph, you
don’t try yourself alone, in the beginning.

21:15.835 --> 21:18.758
What you do is to put them before
the photograph, all right?

21:18.959 --> 21:20.437
And just put a light before the photograph,

21:20.637 --> 21:22.716
ask them to put the hands before
the photograph.

21:22.924 --> 21:25.490
Now you start raising the Kundalini.
After them.

21:25.691 --> 21:28.333
One hand you may keep with
the photograph if you want to,

21:28.534 --> 21:31.526
raise with the another hand the Kundalini
at the back, just like this.

21:31.727 --> 21:35.204
You yourself will feel it rising, and
the fellow can feel it also –

21:35.405 --> 21:38.533
one hand may not be feeling, another
hand may not be feeling, all that,

21:38.734 --> 21:42.204
and then you will know which chakras
is catching by your fingers, you see,

21:42.405 --> 21:44.773
it’s all in the book. Have you got
the book?

21:44.974 --> 21:48.516
All right, you’ll get the book, it’s there.
And then you will know yourself

21:48.717 --> 21:51.610
and then you will know what is the chakras
that are catching,

21:51.811 --> 21:55.480
and, of course, we have a centre, where
you will know how to correct the centres,

21:55.681 --> 22:00.351
how to establish their realisation.
All right?

22:00.552 --> 22:03.839
And also, those who want to come
to India are welcome,

22:04.040 --> 22:06.924
we are having a tour for about – not
so many days actually,

22:07.125 --> 22:10.938
if you see, it’s about forty days tour –
in the villages of India,

22:11.139 --> 22:13.942
if you can have a little rough time,
if you don’t mind,

22:14.143 --> 22:17.206
you can come along, and it will be
a good idea.

22:17.407 --> 22:22.500
So also that I will inform Christine about
it, how we are going to organize it,

22:22.701 --> 22:27.228
and you can come there. Because he came
with me, just came to me, first of all,

22:27.429 --> 22:31.638
and then I took him round, in the villages
and then he got established well.

22:31.839 --> 22:37.659
Then he went back to Australia, now
he has established in seven cities.

22:37.860 --> 22:41.533
I mean, not he but others with him,
whom he got realised and all that,

22:41.734 --> 22:46.134
now in seven cities they have got centres
and Sahaja Yoga is spreading very fast.

22:46.335 --> 22:49.971
So, that’s how it is.

22:50.172 --> 22:52.859
To establish it is not difficult, Christine
is here,

22:53.060 --> 22:55.515
but you should be steady about it, steady.

22:55.716 --> 22:58.837
And forget all that you have read, forget
about what you know,

22:59.038 --> 23:02.120
just for the time being just become one
with your Spirit.

23:02.321 --> 23:06.012
And then you start yourself learning
what is wrong, what is good.

23:06.213 --> 23:09.018
As he asked me how to make out: first
you become your Spirit,

23:09.219 --> 23:11.919
then you can make it out, then you get
the discretion.

23:12.120 --> 23:20.090
That power, you get the vibratory power
of the cool breeze. All right? Yes?

23:20.291 --> 23:23.897
Seeker: Mother, what about Sun Myung Moon?
Is he an anti-Christ?

23:24.098 --> 23:26.666
Warren: What about Mr. Moon, the Moonie
man?

23:26.867 --> 23:30.056
Shri Mataji: Now! Ah!
Seeker: Is he an anti-Christ?

23:34.804 --> 23:37.954
Warren: He said, “Is he an anti-Christ?”

23:39.066 --> 23:45.024
Shri Mataji: You see, they are all
the satans, I tell you.

23:45.225 --> 23:50.150
They were born many-a-times and they
have been killed many-a-times.

23:50.350 --> 23:56.083
Sixteen of them are real satans.
And six women.

23:56.284 --> 24:00.645
I think, seventy percent of them have
settled down here.

24:00.846 --> 24:05.374
Six women and sixteen of them are real
satanic forces.

24:05.575 --> 24:09.828
And this Moon business is, now he is going
to Germany. Just imagine.

24:10.028 --> 24:14.689
He was driven out of London, so now
he’s gone to Germany.

24:14.890 --> 24:16.949
I mean, you should understand that
when there is love

24:17.149 --> 24:21.409
your family system should improve, your
relationships should improve;

24:21.610 --> 24:25.712
he was using them just for his own purpose,
making a business out of them.

24:25.912 --> 24:31.240
You cannot make business out of God,
and Godly people!

24:32.796 --> 24:37.181
Business God does not know, He does
not understand your money!

24:37.382 --> 24:40.813
He doesn’t understand. I’m so hopelessly
bad, you don’t know, ask them.

24:41.014 --> 24:44.056
I mean, I am absolutely hopeless, I mean,
I don’t understand money at all,

24:44.256 --> 24:47.099
I try, I try, I try – but I’ve no brains,

24:47.299 --> 24:50.682
my intelligence goes off, I’ve no brains
to understand money.

24:50.882 --> 24:56.278
You see, so many types of money you
have, it’s horrible!

24:57.719 --> 25:02.175
I get so fed up with the whole stuff.

25:03.548 --> 25:06.418
It’s a big joke, I tell you.

25:06.619 --> 25:08.898
See, I don’t know even today how to sign
a cheque.

25:09.099 --> 25:11.498
I’ve to ask him, “You write down
everything, I’ll sign.”

25:11.699 --> 25:15.604
I’m absolutely hopeless as far as worldly
things are concerned.

25:15.805 --> 25:19.473
I can’t even open one packet. But I can
open your Kundalini.

25:19.674 --> 25:22.613
And give you realisation. I’m very bad,
at many things.

25:22.814 --> 25:26.775
So hopeless you can’t imagine. I depend
on you entirely.

25:26.976 --> 25:30.683
With this country where everything is to be
set, you see, you are set;

25:30.884 --> 25:35.427
for this you are set, and I am so unset,
I don’t know what to do.

25:38.933 --> 25:42.177
Warren: Shall we have it now?

25:44.769 --> 25:47.518
Shri Mataji: All right. Put your hands like
this, straight.

25:47.719 --> 25:51.617
You have to take out your shoes, I’m
sorry, is it very cold now?

25:51.818 --> 25:53.761
Warren: Take your shoes off. Shri Mataji:
[Indistinct] … but doesn’t matter.

25:53.976 --> 25:57.637
For a while, for a while, just for a while.
Warren: Keeps you, keeps you earthed.

25:57.909 --> 26:00.318
Just hold your hands up, press them
on your lap is the best, don’t…

26:00.519 --> 26:03.705
Shri Mataji: Just be comfortable, first
is – and if you have ties and all that,

26:03.905 --> 26:07.528
you can little bit loosen your ties, will
be better idea for Vishuddhi, is to be.

26:07.729 --> 26:10.344
Or if you are wearing anything in your
neck better to take it out,

26:10.545 --> 26:13.442
it’s better, it will help you. It will
help, definitely help.

26:13.643 --> 26:16.989
Any material thing around the neck
stops, it’s a problem.

26:17.189 --> 26:21.586
Just take it out, it’s better [Warren:
Slip it off, just for five minutes].

26:27.229 --> 26:29.358
Now, if your mind is questioning, tell it
to stop,

26:29.559 --> 26:33.360
otherwise it will just come in between
like a monkey just comes in.

26:33.561 --> 26:40.049
Tell the monkey to stop for a while.
She has been all the time bothering you.

26:41.573 --> 26:44.797
You just … here (indistinct words).

26:47.065 --> 26:50.168
Just put your hands straight.

27:05.720 --> 27:08.668
Now close your eyes. Better keep
your eyes closed

27:08.869 --> 27:13.879
because of Agnya, you see, it doesn’t
rise above Agnya.

27:21.442 --> 27:24.999
Can you get some more water for me?

27:34.799 --> 27:38.737
Just let it go, don’t put your attention
concentrated anywhere;

27:38.956 --> 27:41.299
I mean, if you find your attention is very
wobbly,

27:41.500 --> 27:44.996
then at the most you can look at your
fontanel bone on top of your head;

27:45.197 --> 27:50.967
but try not to control the attention, just
let it be.

27:51.168 --> 27:53.734
Let it be, it will work spontaneously,
automatically,

27:53.934 --> 27:59.971
you don’t have to do anything, all right?
Just keep it loose.

28:14.400 --> 28:17.258
Keep your hands straight, and keep
your eyes shut.

28:17.459 --> 28:21.561
Straight towards me, straight towards me.
With your fingers towards me.

28:21.762 --> 28:25.853
As if you are asking for your realisation.

28:27.274 --> 28:31.445
Keep your eyes shut, that is very
important.

28:44.515 --> 28:47.954
Don’t say any mantras and don’t push
your head too much

28:48.155 --> 28:51.133
upward or downward, just keep it
in the centre.

28:51.334 --> 28:57.083
Do not put any pressure on your Vishuddhi
chakra. Just leave it alone.

28:57.284 --> 29:00.834
And just sit with a comfortable position.

29:01.035 --> 29:03.792
And not with any strain on the body,
anywhere –

29:03.992 --> 29:10.043
just be very comfortable and relaxed,
and just put your hands.

29:11.964 --> 29:15.193
Do not strain yourself, at all; you don’t
have to strain,

29:15.393 --> 29:19.194
you don’t have to work it out, it will just
work out automatically.

29:19.395 --> 29:22.358
Just keep it straight.

29:22.763 --> 29:26.466
Maybe some people might feel a little bit
of heat in the hands –

29:26.667 --> 29:28.502
doesn’t matter. It will go away.

29:28.703 --> 29:30.952
If you have heat in the hands you can
throw it away like this,

29:31.153 --> 29:36.408
as you throw away the water. And then
again put the hands, if there’s heat.

30:25.094 --> 30:27.730
Open the door.

31:02.496 --> 31:05.477
Little bit, little bit.

32:18.150 --> 32:20.620
(Aside) Right heart.

33:59.919 --> 34:04.409
Better. [Warren: “It’s better, it’s
cleared. It’s very good”].

34:06.015 --> 34:12.758
You put your right hand again on your
heart. Keep your eyes shut.

34:12.959 --> 34:19.087
And say that, “Mother, I’m the Spirit.”

34:19.288 --> 34:23.503
[People repeat: “Mother, I’m the Spirit.”]
Please say it again.

34:23.704 --> 34:27.717
[People repeat: “Mother, I’m the Spirit.”]
Please say it again.

34:27.917 --> 34:33.619
[People repeat: “Mother, I’m the Spirit.”]
“Mother, I’m not guilty.”

34:33.820 --> 34:37.289
[People repeat: “Mother, I’m not guilty.”]
Again.

34:37.490 --> 34:40.809
[People repeat: “Mother, I’m not guilty.”]
Again.

34:41.010 --> 34:44.210
[People repeat: “Mother, I’m not guilty.”]

34:44.411 --> 34:47.262
Now just say, “Mother, forgive me if
I have done any mistakes.”

34:47.463 --> 34:49.715
Without feeling guilty.

34:49.916 --> 34:53.263
[People repeat: “Mother, forgive me
if I have done any mistakes.”]

34:53.464 --> 34:58.307
Again, please. [People repeat: “Mother,
forgive me if I have done any mistakes.”]

34:58.524 --> 35:04.507
Again, please. [People repeat: “Mother,
forgive me if I have done any mistakes.”]

35:04.708 --> 35:08.798
Now put both the hands towards me
without opening your eyes,

35:08.999 --> 35:12.937
and say, “Mother, please give me
my realisation.”

35:13.138 --> 35:18.347
[People repeat: “Mother, please, give me
my realisation.”]

35:18.548 --> 35:22.273
Again. [“Mother, please give me
my realisation.”]

35:22.474 --> 35:27.195
Again. [“Mother, please give me
my realisation.”]

35:27.396 --> 35:33.063
“Make me my own guru. Please, make me –
Mother, make me my own guru.”

35:33.278 --> 35:37.352
[People repeat: “Please Mother, make me
my own guru.”

35:37.553 --> 35:41.508
“Please Mother, make me my own guru.”

35:41.709 --> 35:46.905
“Please Mother, make me my own guru.”

35:49.841 --> 35:55.893
Ah! Feeling the cool breeze? Put both
the hands towards me.

36:07.584 --> 36:10.865
There should be no sense of insecurity,
some people do feel –

36:11.066 --> 36:13.772
because I’m going away. I’m not going
away anywhere,

36:13.973 --> 36:19.850
I’m with you every moment, you'll remember
me, I’ll be with you.

36:43.382 --> 36:47.919
Hm, good. Felt it?

36:57.727 --> 37:02.577
Those who have not felt the cool breeze,
raise your hands.

37:10.060 --> 37:13.779
All right, keep them raised, all right?
Little keep them raised.

37:13.980 --> 37:16.801
You can go and see them.

37:18.539 --> 37:22.277
See all the new people in any case.

37:24.336 --> 37:28.056
She’s got it. See the gentleman here.

37:29.430 --> 37:33.276
Put his left to the right. This lady
you can see.

37:33.849 --> 37:38.354
Xavier? You can see that gentleman there,
next to you.

37:38.555 --> 37:44.189
She is all right, she’s got it. The another
one, second to her.

37:44.390 --> 37:47.736
Just see. Yes.

37:47.937 --> 37:52.182
Not this, the one next to you. Yes.
He had it.

37:54.075 --> 37:58.387
See this gentleman here, somebody.

38:01.111 --> 38:03.730
Yogi: He’s got it, Mother.
