00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:13.769
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:20.480
At the very outset we have to know that truth
is what it is.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:30.029
We cannot change it, we cannot transform it,
we cannot describe it, we cannot purchase

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.219
it.

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:37.920
It is, it has been and it will be.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:50.730
I’m so very happy to see so many seekers
of truth in Los Angeles.

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:59.210
So whatever I’m going to tell you today,
you are not to take Me for granted, nor you

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:05.180
have to believe Me blind-folded.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:12.690
We have had lots of problems because of this
kind of blind-folded faith.

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:24.090
But whatever I’m telling you, you have to
know that this is just a hypothesis I’m

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.350
putting forth.

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:39.390
If it is proved, then you have to believe
in it as honest people because it is for your

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:47.240
benevolence, it is for the benevolence of
your family, it is for the benevolence of

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:58.180
this city, it is for the benevolence of your
country and it is for the benevolence of the

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:03.840
whole world.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:10.489
It is important that now we have to think
about our benevolence.

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:24.010
We have had lots of fun, pleasures, all kinds
of enterprises in our life.

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:35.040
But what do we seek in those enterprises is
joy, anand.

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:42.239
Whatever you want to have, you want to have
it because you think by that you will feel

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:46.230
satisfied and you’ll have joy.

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:51.170
But it is not so.

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:58.760
Today we want to have, say, for example, a
house, all right?

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.430
Then we want to have a car.

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:07.569
All right, then we want to have a helicopter,
I think.

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:12.170
Then it goes on like that one to another.

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.810
We are never satisfied.

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:26.090
If these desires were pure desires, we should
have been satisfied when we got them.

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:36.599
Also economics says that in general wants
are not satiable.

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:42.040
Now whatever you have been told about this
power which is residing in our triangular

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:49.879
bone called as sacrum, that means the Greeks
knew it was a sacred bone.

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:53.989
They called it sacrum.

00:03:53.989 --> 00:04:09.599
And this bone has this power within us which
is the pure desire and what is the pure desire?

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:19.670
That is the truth about ourselves that you
are not this body, this mind, this ego, these

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:24.130
conditionings, this emotions, this intellect.

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:36.650
You are not that because you say my emotions,
my ego, but who is this “my”?

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:38.860
So you are not that.

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:47.150
The truth is you are the pure Spirit.

00:04:47.150 --> 00:05:02.199
The second truth is that there is a all-pervading
Divine power of love.

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:06.780
This power of love does all the living work.

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:10.640
For example, now you see beautiful flowers
all over.

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:13.580
We take them for granted.

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:18.449
We don’t even think that it’s a miracle.

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:20.569
Who runs our heart?

00:05:20.569 --> 00:05:26.690
If you ask the doctors, they will say it is
autonomous nervous system.

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:33.009
But who is this auto?

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:44.080
So all these living things are done by the
Divine power of love.

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:50.750
I say to you this, you need not believe it
M. But tonight you are going to feel it, you

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:58.199
are going to feel it on your finger tips this
all-pervading power of Divine love which is

00:05:58.199 --> 00:06:02.539
called as paramchaitanya in Sanskrit language.

00:06:02.539 --> 00:06:10.250
In Koran it is called as ruh, in the Bible
it is called as the cool breeze of the Holy

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:21.470
Ghost and Patanjali has called it as Ritambhara
Pragya, which is rather a tongue twister.

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:24.230
So this power exists.

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:33.400
You see the result, you see the result that
living things are happening.

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:41.610
Now if you go to the science, it has its own
limitations.

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:47.730
First of all, science is amoral.

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:51.699
You can destroy Hiroshima, is all right with
science after all.

00:06:51.699 --> 00:07:05.169
You can do whatever you want to do because
you think you have mastered the matter, but

00:07:05.169 --> 00:07:12.789
that is not our job is to destroy people all
over the world.

00:07:12.789 --> 00:07:24.509
This idea of destruction comes because we
forget that we do not know the absolute truth.

00:07:24.509 --> 00:07:29.710
First we have to know the absolute truth,
then we’ll know where are we.

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:31.470
What are we doing?

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:33.860
What we are supposed to do.

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:42.419
You are quite aware as to what is happening
in the world, especially in America about

00:07:42.419 --> 00:07:47.180
which I am very much concerned.

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:52.520
As you know, there are sixty-five per cent
people are expected to be sick within ten

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:55.020
years’ time.

00:07:55.020 --> 00:08:07.349
It’s not only a sickness of the body but
of the mind and this destruction will one

00:08:07.349 --> 00:08:18.069
day create such a vacuum that we’ll be all
shocked

00:08:18.069 --> 00:08:23.350
why we are born as human beings and why we
should be destroyed?

00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:30.620
After all, the Creator has created us with
such understanding, with such love, He has

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:36.490
evolved us to this position and now why should
we be destroyed?

00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:43.440
The reason is: we must find out why are we
on this earth.

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:54.860
We are on this earth to become the Spirit,
to be a channel of God’s love and above

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:58.519
all, to enter into the Kingdom of God.

00:08:58.519 --> 00:09:07.780
When I say to you it sounds rather impractical
and people can’t believe it.

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:09.350
It’s a fact.

00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:19.730
It’s the truth, I’m telling you that the
time has come for all of you to become the

00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:20.730
Spirit.

00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:22.790
It’s a special time.

00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:26.470
I call it a Blossom Time.

00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:29.280
They call it the Last Judgment.

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:32.170
Some people call it as Qiyama.

00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:37.540
Even in Sanskrit there are words, many words
to describe it.

00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:48.860
So now we have to be the Spirit, otherwise
we should see with our own eyes the destruction

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:52.510
of our fellow men and of ourselves.

00:09:52.510 --> 00:09:55.149
There’s nothing in between.

00:09:55.149 --> 00:10:08.290
Either you become Spirit or all kinds of destructions
will start.

00:10:08.290 --> 00:10:16.800
You’ve been already told about the centers
that exist within you.

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:21.820
On the medical side, we can say that they
express themselves and manifest themselves

00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:36.560
as plexuses, but also they act on the left-hand
side as shown there on our mind.

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:41.250
So we’ll take one center and I’ll tell
you what can happen to you.

00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:49.380
Of course, Sahaja Yoga is a meta science.

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:56.839
Whatever I’m saying you can find out and
you’ll discover that whatever I’m saying

00:10:56.839 --> 00:11:00.019
is the truth.

00:11:00.019 --> 00:11:08.519
This one chakra we’ll deal today because
I could feel what’s the problem of Los Angeles.

00:11:08.519 --> 00:11:18.750
This center that we call as Swadishthana , the
yellow-colored one.

00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:26.720
It comes out of the third center what we call
the Nabhi chakra, the solar plexus.

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:39.010
But this one which manifests aortic plexus
moves all over your abdominal viscera and

00:11:39.010 --> 00:11:53.839
gives energy to your liver, to your pancreas,
to your spleen, to your kidneys, to your intestines

00:11:53.839 --> 00:11:54.839
one side.

00:11:54.839 --> 00:12:01.950
Another thing important thing it does, about
which I think doctors don’t know, perhaps,

00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:07.610
is that it transforms energy for the use of
the gray cells.

00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:23.149
The gray cells in the brain we use when we
are futuristic, we think too much, read too

00:12:23.149 --> 00:12:28.029
much, when we are very mental.

00:12:28.029 --> 00:12:37.440
This energy is used and for that this poor
center has to work very hard.

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:45.949
Today’s life as it is, you see, where it
is so futuristic.

00:12:45.949 --> 00:12:50.690
Not only that but we have become really very
mental people.

00:12:50.690 --> 00:13:00.790
We go on thinking, thinking, thinking and
this thinking is done by the gray cells which

00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:03.360
require the energy.

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:12.149
So this poor center has to work for this only
work when you are a thinker.

00:13:12.149 --> 00:13:15.110
Now it has to do other things also.

00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:24.150
So it neglects all other viscera.

00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:40.769
(Mother talks aside.)

00:13:40.769 --> 00:13:42.470
So all others are neglected.

00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:51.550
Now when the liver is neglected, it is a very,
very important, extremely important organ

00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:55.300
in our body.

00:13:55.300 --> 00:14:04.990
It takes out all the poison from our body
as heat and pass it into blood.

00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:10.449
It cleanses through this process.

00:14:10.449 --> 00:14:19.000
But when this liver is neglected, it cannot
do that work which it has to do; then the

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:26.019
heat starts accumulating in the liver.

00:14:26.019 --> 00:14:32.830
Such a person is quite a hot-tempered person,
very hot-tempered can be.

00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:38.199
When he tries to control the temper, he gets
even worse.

00:14:38.199 --> 00:14:46.009
That’s not the only thing that happens.

00:14:46.009 --> 00:14:54.250
This heat consumes all the fats and such a
person starts becoming extremely thin.

00:14:54.250 --> 00:14:58.910
He doesn’t like food, he doesn’t like
people.

00:14:58.910 --> 00:15:10.529
I mean his attention becomes extremely disturbed
and he thinks no end of himself.

00:15:10.529 --> 00:15:17.279
He thinks that all others are stupid fools;
I’m the only wisest person.

00:15:17.279 --> 00:15:23.279
If anybody thinks like that then they should
know they have a liver problem.

00:15:23.279 --> 00:15:29.829
Now thus a thing called ego starts growing.

00:15:29.829 --> 00:15:37.850
This is the white color into the brain crosses
over and you get a big balloon of ego.

00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:42.830
That’s on one side, doesn’t matter.

00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:45.490
But what happens to your body?

00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:59.680
This heat of the liver then starts rising
and when it goes to the pancreas, you develop

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:00.680
diabetes.

00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:05.410
Is a very common disease of modern man is
diabetes.

00:16:05.410 --> 00:16:12.399
Now can you imagine in India we have villagers,
simple people.

00:16:12.399 --> 00:16:16.959
They don’t think so much, you see.

00:16:16.959 --> 00:16:19.699
They earn, today, eat their food, sleep off.

00:16:19.699 --> 00:16:21.029
Next morning they are again up.

00:16:21.029 --> 00:16:27.069
They don’t have to insure anything, they
don’t have to worry about it.

00:16:27.069 --> 00:16:34.769
But they take so much of sugar, sometimes
four, five spoons, big spoons.

00:16:34.769 --> 00:16:43.899
The spoon must stand straight at right angle
otherwise they think this is not tea at all

00:16:43.899 --> 00:16:46.110
and they take it three, four cups of tea.

00:16:46.110 --> 00:16:47.330
They never get diabetes.

00:16:47.330 --> 00:17:00.009
It’s a wonderful thing, you know, that you
can have as much sweet as you like, you never

00:17:00.009 --> 00:17:01.220
get diabetes.

00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:11.860
Now these villagers don’t think but those
who are sitting on their chair planning, thinking

00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:19.959
of the future all the time, they definitely
get diabetes.

00:17:19.959 --> 00:17:29.730
Then what happens?

00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:39.400
Then the another movement of the same heat
goes to spleen and now this is even worse.

00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:43.580
Spleen is a speedometer.

00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:45.480
It keeps our speed.

00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:52.340
Supposing we have eaten our food and then
we want to run, get a pain here, because it

00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:59.760
supplies red blood corpuscles for emergencies.

00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:11.000
If the spleen goes out of order with the heat
as well as the kind of life we have, a very

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.000
hectic life.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:19.880
First of all, what I see in America is really
terrible because they get up late, in the

00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:22.990
night sleep late first of all and get up late.

00:18:22.990 --> 00:18:29.030
Then early in the morning they have to go
to work, so they are in a hurry.

00:18:29.030 --> 00:18:36.509
They’ll pull back their jeans and then I
don’t know.

00:18:36.509 --> 00:18:42.840
They don’t eat at all, they don’t even
brush, get into the car, start brushing and

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:48.660
then they have their food in the car, or call
it the breakfast, so-called breakfast.

00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:54.210
Here it is all the cars are honking and you’re
getting late and there’s a jam, this that.

00:18:54.210 --> 00:19:00.740
This poor spleen doesn’t know what to do,
because it’s such a hectic life.

00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:06.910
It doesn’t know how to cope with such a
hectic person who sometimes needs this, sometimes

00:19:06.910 --> 00:19:10.740
needs that, so it becomes hectic.

00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:23.429
But then it is vulnerable to a very serious
disease which we call as blood cancer, leukemia.

00:19:23.429 --> 00:19:32.429
On the contrary, if our life is a peaceful
quiet life, we nicely get up in the morning,

00:19:32.429 --> 00:19:39.230
have our bath, don’t go for jogging, that’s
also another thing.

00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:41.380
Jogging is right-sided.

00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:45.440
Jogging is all right for people who are lethargic,
you see.

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:48.760
Indians would be better.

00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:50.870
But not for Americans.

00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:57.230
Because this is the physical as well as the
mental side, right side.

00:19:57.230 --> 00:20:03.470
And suddenly you get a shock or something
happens.

00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:05.110
Specially the newspapers.

00:20:05.110 --> 00:20:09.430
They believe in just giving you shocks.

00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:12.000
So in the morning you read something.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.620
“Oh, what has happened?”

00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:15.669
And you get a shock.

00:20:15.669 --> 00:20:21.790
Now you won’t believe the way they are describing
now the calamities in India are not so bad.

00:20:21.790 --> 00:20:25.400
I’ve telephoned, I found out, it’s not
so bad.

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:30.620
But why the newspaper are doing because they
love to give you shocks and you also love

00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:34.390
them because they give you shocks, I think.

00:20:34.390 --> 00:20:44.990
So in this shocking conditions this poor spleen
of yours cannot cope and that’s how you

00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:49.100
get this horrible disease called blood cancer.

00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:54.450
Now I must tell you with Sahaja Yoga we have
completely cured blood cancer, completely

00:20:54.450 --> 00:20:56.260
cured of many people.

00:20:56.260 --> 00:20:58.539
It’s a fact.

00:20:58.539 --> 00:21:04.110
Without going to doctors, without going for
diagnosis because in the diagnosis only half

00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:09.090
people die, but we know their trouble.

00:21:09.090 --> 00:21:13.299
They and we know what they are suffering from
and it can be worked out.

00:21:13.299 --> 00:21:14.760
Just this Kundalini is to be raised.

00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:23.500
She goes to this center and just pacifies,
enlightens it, nourishes it and the whole

00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:26.059
thing changes.

00:21:26.059 --> 00:21:30.350
I’m not telling you a cock and bull story.

00:21:30.350 --> 00:21:32.250
I really tell you.

00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:39.440
You should know that it is all happening,
it’s all happening today, everywhere.

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:48.179
Then the third thing that happens is that
your kidneys get coagulated and you get kidney

00:21:48.179 --> 00:21:49.620
trouble.

00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:54.289
Then you have to go for dialysis and you end
up as bankrupts.

00:21:54.289 --> 00:21:57.370
I mean they do not cure you with dialysis.

00:21:57.370 --> 00:21:59.580
No, there’s no cure with dialysis.

00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:11.240
But the only thing that happens that you can
become a bankrupt and then die.

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:14.040
Then it goes to intestines, creates problem.

00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:21.529
You never feel hungry and whatever you may
eat, you get into constipation of terrible

00:22:21.529 --> 00:22:27.960
dimensions and that leads to then hernia and
all kinds of diseases.

00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:32.600
So with one center how many things you are
suffering.

00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:35.900
But that’s not the end of it.

00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:37.380
Then this heat rises upward.

00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:41.090
There’s a center we call it as right heart.

00:22:41.090 --> 00:22:42.740
Here you can see.

00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:47.960
When this center is affected, you develop
asthma.

00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:54.130
Asthma is one hundred per cent curable in
Sahaja Yoga.

00:22:54.130 --> 00:22:56.260
We have a doctor who got his MD.

00:22:56.260 --> 00:23:09.710
Now he’s in America for curing cancer, curing
asthma through Sahaja Yoga.

00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:14.010
Absolutely curable.

00:23:14.010 --> 00:23:22.460
So with the intestines, with the kidney, there
are problems which seem, looks like, people

00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:25.490
say, is incurable, but not.

00:23:25.490 --> 00:23:32.280
These are the fundamentals we have, and if
you have to deal with the fundamentals, then

00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:38.700
the rest of it falls into proper picture.

00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:42.700
Like supposing now there’s a tree which
is sick.

00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:48.090
Now if you start treating the leaves, you
can’t cure.

00:23:48.090 --> 00:23:55.570
If you try to correct it through its branches,
you can’t cure.

00:23:55.570 --> 00:24:03.330
You have to go deep down into the roots and
the sap that rises will cure it.

00:24:03.330 --> 00:24:05.090
In the same way, these are the roots.

00:24:05.090 --> 00:24:08.419
This is the knowledge of the roots I’m telling
you.

00:24:08.419 --> 00:24:13.590
I see Los Angeles every year is growing and
growing and growing.

00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:20.320
America is growing very fast, no doubt.

00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:31.590
But when a tree of this civilization is growing
so fast we must find out about our roots.

00:24:31.590 --> 00:24:40.049
And if you do not find out about your roots
how are you going to look after this huge

00:24:40.049 --> 00:24:47.840
big civilization you have created which is
dry, which has no nourishment?

00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:50.279
So we have to go to our roots.

00:24:50.279 --> 00:25:00.350
Another problem is that if this knowledge
is coming from India, people have an objection.

00:25:00.350 --> 00:25:05.610
It should come from America or from England.

00:25:05.610 --> 00:25:22.279
Many people believe that Christ was born in
England.

00:25:22.279 --> 00:25:30.679
Is impossible to say that all right, you have
science, which we have learned; now we have

00:25:30.679 --> 00:25:31.679
something.

00:25:31.679 --> 00:25:34.690
Why shouldn’t you learn, if it is for your
good?

00:25:34.690 --> 00:25:38.350
It’s only not I am saying that.

00:25:38.350 --> 00:25:41.540
We had poets in London like William Blake.

00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:49.419
He has said for these days that the men of
God will be born in those days and they will

00:25:49.419 --> 00:25:55.760
become Divine and they will have powers to
make others Divine, said by an Englishman.

00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:58.710
I don’t know if you read C.S.

00:25:58.710 --> 00:25:59.710
Lewis or not.

00:25:59.710 --> 00:26:01.299
Another one, so many.

00:26:01.299 --> 00:26:02.429
There was also one poet.

00:26:02.429 --> 00:26:05.600
He was Englishman who came in here and lived
here.

00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:12.990
I read them and I’m surprised that this
has already been predicted.

00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:19.830
So some people start thinking about it and
they think, “Let’s go to religion.”

00:26:19.830 --> 00:26:25.399
Nothing wrong with religion as such and nothing
wrong with the people who have created it,

00:26:25.399 --> 00:26:36.700
but I must say people like Jesus Christ or
Mohammed Sahab were really very, very great

00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:43.950
people, were very, very great people and they
were so much evolved.

00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:50.470
They were so much evolved that they never
understood human beings, what sort of things

00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:52.220
they are dealing with.

00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:54.409
I’ll give you an example.

00:26:54.409 --> 00:27:04.550
Fifth chapter Mathews, Christ has said that:
“If your one eye does anything wrong, take

00:27:04.550 --> 00:27:06.360
it out.

00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:09.429
Otherwise, take out the other one.

00:27:09.429 --> 00:27:17.279
If your one hand does something wrong, then
you cut it or cut both the hands.

00:27:17.279 --> 00:27:23.460
If somebody slaps you on this side, you turn
the other side.”

00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:31.350
I have yet to see one Christian who has cut
his hands or taken out his eyes.

00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:33.510
Is impossible.

00:27:33.510 --> 00:27:37.059
He thought you were such, we were all such
great…

00:27:37.059 --> 00:27:43.390
I was born myself in a Christian religion
so I was shocked, how could these people follow

00:27:43.390 --> 00:27:49.450
these rules and regulations which are beyond
human beings because they’ll have to take

00:27:49.450 --> 00:27:56.470
out their eyes or they’ll have to cut their
hands?

00:27:56.470 --> 00:28:01.930
Then Mohammed Sahab thought that such strictness
was there for men, why not we have something

00:28:01.930 --> 00:28:02.930
for women.

00:28:02.930 --> 00:28:05.120
So for women also, he said, “All right.

00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:15.250
If a woman is not moral, she should be put
in the Mother Earth and should be beaten with

00:28:15.250 --> 00:28:18.279
shoes or with stones.”

00:28:18.279 --> 00:28:22.549
Now imagine: What about American ladies here?

00:28:22.549 --> 00:28:29.549
It’s a dangerous situation.

00:28:29.549 --> 00:28:38.290
So then came the another one called Sharia,
you see, it was actually given to the Jews

00:28:38.290 --> 00:28:42.039
by Moses when he saw they were very decadent.

00:28:42.039 --> 00:28:48.850
So he gave them this, this is in the Jeremiah,
who has written clearly that he said that

00:28:48.850 --> 00:28:52.769
if you steal something, your hand should be
cut.

00:28:52.769 --> 00:28:56.750
All this Sharia was given to Jews, but Jews
were wise.

00:28:56.750 --> 00:28:59.010
They said, “Baba, we can’t do this.

00:28:59.010 --> 00:29:00.010
No, no.”

00:29:00.010 --> 00:29:05.870
So the Muslims have taken over and they are
putting on their […?] I have yet to come

00:29:05.870 --> 00:29:15.730
across one Muslim who can be called as a real
Muslim, or one Christian who can be called

00:29:15.730 --> 00:29:17.090
as a real Christian.

00:29:17.090 --> 00:29:23.029
It’s none of their mistakes, after all,
they are human beings and these laws and regulations

00:29:23.029 --> 00:29:24.660
are for saints.

00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:31.120
If the saints do anything wrong, then they
should be punished.

00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:36.340
Not for ordinary human beings, it’s too
much.

00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:42.010
But to us religion now has become a matter
of fighting.

00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:46.870
And then you see people, they go on distributing.

00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:51.130
Now like the other day a fellow came with
a Gita to Me.

00:29:51.130 --> 00:29:52.890
He walked up to Me.

00:29:52.890 --> 00:29:55.830
“You must buy this Gita.”

00:29:55.830 --> 00:29:58.120
I said, “I have many already in the house.

00:29:58.120 --> 00:30:01.220
But,” I said, “Why are you wearing this
dhoti here?

00:30:01.220 --> 00:30:03.149
It’s Chicago, is a very cold place.

00:30:03.149 --> 00:30:06.260
You know, you should not wear this dhoti.”

00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:10.400
He said, “My Guru has initiated that I must
wear a dhoti.”

00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:15.830
I said, “Do you think by wearing a dhoti,
you will go to heaven?

00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:21.490
In India everybody wears a dhoti, will theyl
all go to heaven?

00:30:21.490 --> 00:30:23.710
Try to understand now.”

00:30:23.710 --> 00:30:31.070
Now shaven his head completely . I said, “Why
do you shave your head?”

00:30:31.070 --> 00:30:35.310
He said, “That’s what my Guru has told
me that if I have to be spiritual, I must

00:30:35.310 --> 00:30:36.310
shave my head.”

00:30:36.310 --> 00:30:44.971
Kabira has said that if, by shaving your head,
if you can go to Heaven, then the sheep is

00:30:44.971 --> 00:30:57.779
shaven every year, there won’t be any place
for you there!

00:30:57.779 --> 00:31:08.640
All the saints who were real saints were full
of fun about all these things and they could

00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:12.660
see that this is all stupidity.

00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:24.300
The way people are trying to create this kind
of fanaticism is all stupidity.

00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:26.960
It is, then we feel disappointed.

00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:29.399
Same about Hindus.

00:31:29.399 --> 00:31:38.320
Hindus, it is said that in every human being
there is a Spirit.

00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:41.300
Everybody has the Spirit in the heart.

00:31:41.300 --> 00:31:45.230
Then how can you have caste system?

00:31:45.230 --> 00:31:49.580
How can you have a higher race and a lower
race?

00:31:49.580 --> 00:31:52.649
There are so many examples to show.

00:31:52.649 --> 00:32:01.380
For example, Shri Rama ate the fruits from
an old lady who had eaten them before to see

00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:03.419
that they are not sour.

00:32:03.419 --> 00:32:07.210
In India if somebody eats something you’ll
never eat that.

00:32:07.210 --> 00:32:11.809
But look at Shri Rama and then He tells His
wife, “Oh what fruits!

00:32:11.809 --> 00:32:13.840
I’ve never eaten like that.”

00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:15.029
But the brother was angry.

00:32:15.029 --> 00:32:21.600
The brother said, “Why should she give you
such fruits, it’s not proper.”

00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:23.590
So the wife says, “Please give me some.

00:32:23.590 --> 00:32:24.929
After all, I’m your wife.”

00:32:24.929 --> 00:32:28.389
Then she eats something and says, “Wow!

00:32:28.389 --> 00:32:29.860
What fruits!”

00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:34.289
Now the brother Lakshmana says, “Sister-in-law,
give me also little bit.”

00:32:34.289 --> 00:32:38.720
“No, you were so angry, I will not give
you.”

00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:51.260
The whole story shows the love, the compassion,
the oneness, because of love.

00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:56.770
Krishna also had food with a person called
Vidura who was a son of a maidservant.

00:32:56.770 --> 00:33:03.080
He wouldn’t go with the king and eat food
but He would eat with this.

00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:06.279
Now why?

00:33:06.279 --> 00:33:12.600
Because he was a realized soul, Vidura was.

00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:20.260
Every story of Christ or anything you see
is nothing but love.

00:33:20.260 --> 00:33:29.649
But if you are bent upon taking something
like Christ went to a wedding and He made

00:33:29.649 --> 00:33:31.940
wine out of water.

00:33:31.940 --> 00:33:33.799
That’s the simple thing.

00:33:33.799 --> 00:33:37.639
Now I can also do that, not difficult.

00:33:37.639 --> 00:33:40.179
But that’s not the wine.

00:33:40.179 --> 00:33:46.389
That is the taste of grape juice.

00:33:46.389 --> 00:33:48.460
For wine it has to rot.

00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:55.700
Instantaneously who can make wine?

00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:58.519
How can you make wine just by touching water.

00:33:58.519 --> 00:33:59.519
You cannot.

00:33:59.519 --> 00:34:02.110
It has to rot.

00:34:02.110 --> 00:34:07.720
The more rotten it is, the better it is, they
say.

00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:21.770
I’ve never tasted so I don’t know, but
smells horrible, I can tell you this much.

00:34:21.770 --> 00:34:29.830
Now, so we don’t know what to do because
go to religion, there we find fanaticism.

00:34:29.830 --> 00:34:38.030
We find people fighting in the name of God,
making big money out of, I don’t know but

00:34:38.030 --> 00:34:49.480
I read a book about where it said the Vatican
printed one million, no, nine million dollars,

00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:58.970
nine million dollars as counterfeits and distributed
through their own bank.

00:34:58.970 --> 00:35:08.560
How could any religious man think of doing
these things, I can’t understand.

00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:12.060
First of all, they have to be holy people.

00:35:12.060 --> 00:35:13.940
They have to be righteous people.

00:35:13.940 --> 00:35:21.570
If they have interest in your purses, then
how can they be holy men?

00:35:21.570 --> 00:35:23.650
God doesn’t understand money.

00:35:23.650 --> 00:35:25.210
It’s your headache.

00:35:25.210 --> 00:35:27.880
Banking is your headache.

00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:31.870
How can you purchase God with money?

00:35:31.870 --> 00:35:39.780
So I appeal to your intelligence, to your
wisdom, to know that this your American country

00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:49.370
has fed so many false gurus so far without
even thinking what they are doing, without

00:35:49.370 --> 00:35:53.130
even finding that they are just making money.

00:35:53.130 --> 00:35:55.190
They are marketing some nonsense.

00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:57.800
That’s another problem.

00:35:57.800 --> 00:36:03.870
When I came here first nobody would listen
to Me.

00:36:03.870 --> 00:36:04.870
I said, “Why?”

00:36:04.870 --> 00:36:10.190
“Because you don’t take money, so what
is the credibility?"

00:36:10.190 --> 00:36:16.670
They can’t understand anything without money.

00:36:16.670 --> 00:36:17.770
All right, doesn’t matter.

00:36:17.770 --> 00:36:23.820
Now the situation seems to be better.

00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:30.400
But the last thing that happens to you is,
very serious thing with this Swadishthan chakra,

00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:37.090
is that you get a heart attack, a massive
heart attack, especially if you are young,

00:36:37.090 --> 00:36:43.410
and you are playing, say, tennis and you are
drinking too much, you get a heart attack

00:36:43.410 --> 00:36:47.350
which is very massive and which is always
fatal.

00:36:47.350 --> 00:36:50.720
Angina is different.

00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:56.240
But this massive heart attack comes from this
right-side problem.

00:36:56.240 --> 00:37:05.500
Then this heat rises into the head and what
happens, you get paralysis of the right side,

00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:06.660
minimum.

00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:13.840
There are so many diseases out of one center
you can get.

00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:17.230
Then you go to some guru.

00:37:17.230 --> 00:37:20.180
He puts something into your head, I don’t
know what they do.

00:37:20.180 --> 00:37:31.260
Then you get cancers, you get incurable diseases,
you get insomnia, all kinds of things you

00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:33.310
get and ultimately you realize, you have gone
mad.

00:37:33.310 --> 00:37:41.010
I mean I don’t know, a mad man doesn’t
understand he’s mad, but others know.

00:37:41.010 --> 00:37:43.420
But wisdom should be there.

00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:51.120
When you choose a guru, you must know anybody
who wants money for spiritual work cannot

00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:59.430
be a holy person, cannot.

00:37:59.430 --> 00:38:06.200
So at this juncture you have to know that
when this Kundalini rises, first thing that

00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:14.140
happens to us that our innocence starts manifesting.

00:38:14.140 --> 00:38:19.720
Innocence is eternal, it is not temporary,
it is eternal.

00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:27.570
Whatever you may try to destroy it, it is
there and it starts manifesting and then your

00:38:27.570 --> 00:38:32.840
eyes become innocent, absolutely innocent,
and very powerful and there’s a glint of

00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:35.820
the spirituality in your eyes.

00:38:35.820 --> 00:38:49.300
Such eyes are so powerful that even a glance
of such a person can settle down thousands.

00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:59.500
With this innocent eyes you understand that
your attention has lost lust and greed completely

00:38:59.500 --> 00:39:03.680
and you have become a very moral person, very
righteous.

00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:09.340
Nobody has to tell you, don’t do this, don’t
do that, no.

00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:10.750
Just it happens.

00:39:10.750 --> 00:39:11.750
Now how?

00:39:11.750 --> 00:39:16.540
It’s like this, if I have a snake in my
hand, and I’m a very obstinate person and

00:39:16.540 --> 00:39:19.890
you tell me, “There’s a snake in your
hand, please leave it.”

00:39:19.890 --> 00:39:22.520
I’ll say, “No, there’s no snake, it’s
a rope.”

00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:28.320
Till it bites me and I’ll go on saying,
“It's a rope”.

00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:32.770
But if there’s a little light, I’ll throw
it away.

00:39:32.770 --> 00:39:36.250
I’ll know this is wrong.

00:39:36.250 --> 00:39:43.310
As a result of this happening, whatever is
destroying within you, you may think it should

00:39:43.310 --> 00:39:45.280
be given up.

00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:51.730
You may not be knowing also that it is destructive
but you just drop it out.

00:39:51.730 --> 00:39:52.730
Overnight.

00:39:52.730 --> 00:39:59.110
I must tell you I have known people who have
dropped drug addiction.

00:39:59.110 --> 00:40:07.910
Here such a problem exists of drug addiction
and can be completely cured with Sahaja Yoga,

00:40:07.910 --> 00:40:10.750
I can assure you.

00:40:10.750 --> 00:40:17.150
If this Kundalini rises, then not only drug
addiction but any kind of addiction drops

00:40:17.150 --> 00:40:23.770
off.

00:40:23.770 --> 00:40:31.280
Then you know all about your centers on your
fingertips.

00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:34.490
You know what’s wrong with you on your fingertips.

00:40:34.490 --> 00:40:42.020
With this light you know where lies your problem.

00:40:42.020 --> 00:40:44.700
This is self knowledge.

00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:50.390
On your fingertips, means on your central
nervous system, in Sanskrit the word is bodh,

00:40:50.390 --> 00:40:56.020
from where the word Buddha has come, or also
is Vida from where the word Veda has come.

00:40:56.020 --> 00:41:04.500
You have to know the truth, not mentally,
but on your central nervous system, on your

00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:06.930
fingertips.

00:41:06.930 --> 00:41:10.940
So you know the absolute truth.

00:41:10.940 --> 00:41:15.710
Now there are many who came to me who never
believed in God.

00:41:15.710 --> 00:41:20.790
Atheists, they call themselves, especially
in Russia, say Russians.

00:41:20.790 --> 00:41:22.840
But they took no time to get their realization.

00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:27.460
They are such a clean slate, I tell you.

00:41:27.460 --> 00:41:31.870
They have no conditionings, nothing.

00:41:31.870 --> 00:41:37.850
And you won’t believe that we always have
our program in stadiums.

00:41:37.850 --> 00:41:40.120
We cannot have in halls.

00:41:40.120 --> 00:41:46.750
We’ve got sixteen to eighteen thousand people
in one place.

00:41:46.750 --> 00:41:49.050
What is happened with them?

00:41:49.050 --> 00:41:50.760
Why is it they are so sensitive?

00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:55.750
They have thrown away all false gurus, one
by one.

00:41:55.750 --> 00:41:57.250
They’re not bothered.

00:41:57.250 --> 00:42:05.380
After all at least, I must say, sixty per
cent people in Russia are so sensitive to

00:42:05.380 --> 00:42:10.950
spirituality, very sensitive.

00:42:10.950 --> 00:42:21.130
Most amazing thing is that they jump into
it without any difficulty.

00:42:21.130 --> 00:42:30.160
I don’t know how they trust Me so much but
they do trust themselves first and then do

00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:33.310
trust that they have got self-realization.

00:42:33.310 --> 00:42:39.820
I don’t know if you have told them or not
that recently they had a conference of two

00:42:39.820 --> 00:42:41.350
thousand scientists.

00:42:41.350 --> 00:42:48.180
Their scientists are very highly qualified
people where they invited Me to speak to them.

00:42:48.180 --> 00:42:54.200
In the conference I was the chief speaker
and I was amazed.

00:42:54.200 --> 00:42:59.050
There were also ten thousand other people.

00:42:59.050 --> 00:43:03.460
The subject matter they gave Me, “Medicine
and Self-knowledge.”

00:43:03.460 --> 00:43:12.110
They all talked about morality, how important
it is to preserve the society, to preserve

00:43:12.110 --> 00:43:18.530
the families, to preserve the whole society.

00:43:18.530 --> 00:43:23.520
And they were such great surgeons, there was
one surgeon ninety-year old who had operated

00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:27.490
on our prime minister Indira Gandhi, who is
still operating.

00:43:27.490 --> 00:43:32.160
He’s ninety years, and the way he speaks
you wouldn’t make out that he’s of that

00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:40.440
age, and he has written a book against alcoholism
and immorality.

00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:49.040
I can’t think such a subject can ever be
talked about here where your Hollywood is

00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:52.370
so important.

00:43:52.370 --> 00:43:57.220
What harm they have done to you, you don’t
know.

00:43:57.220 --> 00:44:07.380
First of all, Mr. Freud, who just was worshipped
like Christ and he has ruined the people and

00:44:07.380 --> 00:44:15.740
brought them to the sex point only.

00:44:15.740 --> 00:44:19.180
He is from Austria and when I told this in
Austria, they were very happy.

00:44:19.180 --> 00:44:24.040
They clapped, they said he’s brought such
shame to us.

00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:35.220
But here he was worshipped and now the whole
country has been so much degraded by him.

00:44:35.220 --> 00:44:39.110
Now I read the book, “Freudian, Fraudulent
Freud”.

00:44:39.110 --> 00:44:44.160
There’s another book: “Downfall of the
Freudian Empire”.

00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:48.370
But with that, how many have suffered?

00:44:48.370 --> 00:44:50.190
What has happened?

00:44:50.190 --> 00:44:52.000
Families broken.

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:54.470
What nonsense he talked about.

00:44:54.470 --> 00:45:00.000
The mother, that your relationship with mother
is of a sexual nature.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:04.320
God knows he must be having something like
that.

00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:10.430
I told this to an Indian, he said, “Thank
God he didn’t come to India, otherwise we

00:45:10.430 --> 00:45:15.690
would have cut him into pieces and thrown
him into Arabic Sea.”

00:45:15.690 --> 00:45:21.040
How could you accept such an unwise, nonsensical
thing?

00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:29.310
Well, you did and so many people who thought
it was big experimentation, this that.

00:45:29.310 --> 00:45:32.970
It is absolutely a myth, I tell you.

00:45:32.970 --> 00:45:36.762
If you come to Sahaja Yoga, you will know
what is a psyche, how it gets affected, where

00:45:36.762 --> 00:45:43.260
it is, how it works out the real knowledge
about psychology, you will know.

00:45:43.260 --> 00:45:46.250
This is psychology or is it child science?

00:45:46.250 --> 00:45:48.430
I don’t understand.

00:45:48.430 --> 00:45:51.690
It has nothing to do with reality, everything
imaginary.

00:45:51.690 --> 00:46:01.770
Jung, Jung was the one who got realization
and he did say that Freud was wrong.

00:46:01.770 --> 00:46:07.680
He was the one who said it and who talked
of morality.

00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:11.490
But I must tell you one story about Myself.

00:46:11.490 --> 00:46:18.580
They invited Me to a conference of the Jungians.

00:46:18.580 --> 00:46:22.550
It was International Jungians Conference.

00:46:22.550 --> 00:46:29.770
Me, poor thing, was supposed to talk about
Jung and I told them where did Jung went wrong

00:46:29.770 --> 00:46:34.110
because he said the consciousness is vertical.

00:46:34.110 --> 00:46:42.170
No, he said it is horizontal which is not
so and that was the biggest mistake.

00:46:42.170 --> 00:46:46.500
But whatever it is he talked of morality.

00:46:46.500 --> 00:46:51.384
But next day the president, now he’s no
more, so I can tell you the story, came to

00:46:51.384 --> 00:46:52.384
see Me.

00:46:52.384 --> 00:46:53.384
Eighty-five year old, shaking, you know?

00:46:53.384 --> 00:46:57.920
He came to Me, said, “I have some private
work.”

00:46:57.920 --> 00:46:59.370
I said, “What is it?”

00:46:59.370 --> 00:47:06.690
“I have a keep and my wife is dead.

00:47:06.690 --> 00:47:15.260
Can you please help me to cajole this keep
of mine, to tell her that she should now marry

00:47:15.260 --> 00:47:16.260
me?”

00:47:16.260 --> 00:47:24.740
"What's the age of your fiancé or whatever
you call it?"

00:47:24.740 --> 00:47:28.880
"Only about thirty-eight years."

00:47:28.880 --> 00:47:32.440
I said, “Do you think I am supposed to do
all such work?”

00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:35.920
Now this is a Jungian who is talking like
this.

00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:40.030
If it was a Freudian, I could have understood.

00:47:40.030 --> 00:47:47.400
I was shocked and to come to Me for this kind
of a nonsense.

00:47:47.400 --> 00:47:53.530
I said I don’t know what’s wrong with
these people.

00:47:53.530 --> 00:48:01.240
They can’t even understand that spirituality
is holiness, auspiciousness, is purity.

00:48:01.240 --> 00:48:08.800
Can’t understand how he came to ask Me this
question.

00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:12.740
I was so disappointed that nine years I didn’t
visit your country.

00:48:12.740 --> 00:48:15.460
I said, “How can I talk to them?”

00:48:15.460 --> 00:48:18.590
[“I have a keep” means to have a mistress,
Ed.

00:48:18.590 --> 00:48:19.590
]

00:48:19.590 --> 00:48:20.800
Today I have to tell you one thing.

00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:28.930
The time has come for all of you to get your
self-realization, by which your attention

00:48:28.930 --> 00:48:38.600
becomes enlightened, your health gets completely
all right, your mental processes are sensible,

00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:47.120
but above all you stand in your present.

00:48:47.120 --> 00:48:55.260
We live in the past or the future and all
the time we are thinking of past and future.

00:48:55.260 --> 00:48:58.740
We are jumping on the cusp of past and future.

00:48:58.740 --> 00:49:06.360
With this happening you become thoughtlessly
aware because these thoughts elongate.

00:49:06.360 --> 00:49:10.110
Thoughtlessly, but aware.

00:49:10.110 --> 00:49:15.970
And this thoughtless awareness is the time
which is reality in which you grow spiritually.

00:49:15.970 --> 00:49:20.940
Then you get your inspirations.

00:49:20.940 --> 00:49:24.550
All your potential qualities starts manifesting.

00:49:24.550 --> 00:49:35.120
You’ll be amazed in India we have had many
great writers, very great, we should say,

00:49:35.120 --> 00:49:40.830
poets, very great musicians who are now world
famous.

00:49:40.830 --> 00:49:45.100
All of them came to Sahaja Yoga.

00:49:45.100 --> 00:49:46.930
They were nothing.

00:49:46.930 --> 00:49:49.500
Even Miss India that was this time Miss Universe.

00:49:49.500 --> 00:49:56.260
She is a Sahaja Yogini, and she came to Me,
she said, “Mother, is it all right if I

00:49:56.260 --> 00:49:58.670
go for this beauty contest?”

00:49:58.670 --> 00:49:59.770
I said, “What’s wrong?

00:49:59.770 --> 00:50:00.770
You go.”

00:50:00.770 --> 00:50:03.040
“I don’t want to wear funny dresses.”

00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:08.310
I said, “But you wear, after all, swimming
dress, it’s all right.”

00:50:08.310 --> 00:50:12.190
She, she was not such a beautiful girl.

00:50:12.190 --> 00:50:15.940
She asked Me, “Mother, I’m going just
now for Miss India.”

00:50:15.940 --> 00:50:17.880
I said, “You’ll be also Miss Universe.

00:50:17.880 --> 00:50:20.960
Take it from Me.”

00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:23.720
She became.

00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:25.440
Because what is the speciality?

00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:32.620
It’s not only the face, it’s not only
the features or anything, but it is the inner

00:50:32.620 --> 00:50:39.860
beauty, it’s the balance, it’s the poise,
it’s the wisdom, all these things put together

00:50:39.860 --> 00:50:42.990
make a personality.

00:50:42.990 --> 00:50:46.480
Not only just your face, how you look.

00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:47.870
That’s not important.

00:50:47.870 --> 00:50:51.580
See, look at Mahatma Gandhi, how he looked
like.

00:50:51.580 --> 00:50:54.740
I don’t know I have seen him, I have lived
with him in my childhood.

00:50:54.740 --> 00:51:07.190
Such a bony structure, but even Samson would
have been afraid of him, he was like that.

00:51:07.190 --> 00:51:12.540
Such a power of truth and honesty in his heart.

00:51:12.540 --> 00:51:21.850
It’s not that his face was very impressive,
but the inner power which was within him.

00:51:21.850 --> 00:51:24.970
I know of another prime minister very well
Lal Bahadur Shastri.

00:51:24.970 --> 00:51:31.770
I’m talking about him because both were
born on the same date of 2nd of October.

00:51:31.770 --> 00:51:35.930
Another person, tremendously powerful, very
short man.

00:51:35.930 --> 00:51:44.130
So powerful he was and his realization of
such a high degree.

00:51:44.130 --> 00:51:50.520
He could easily make out who [BREAK IN RECORDING]
Of course, he respected Me very much.

00:51:50.520 --> 00:52:02.120
I used to be very shy,because he would not
even sit before Me

00:52:02.120 --> 00:52:10.390
on the chair.

00:52:10.390 --> 00:52:15.080
Is what we call self-realization.

00:52:15.080 --> 00:52:24.430
In Sanskrit an egg is called as Dwijaha, the
bird is called Dwijaha and a human being,

00:52:24.430 --> 00:52:29.320
when he is realized, also called as Dwijaha,
means born twice.

00:52:29.320 --> 00:52:31.960
So first it’s an egg, then it becomes a
bird.

00:52:31.960 --> 00:52:34.670
There are two different things.

00:52:34.670 --> 00:52:39.620
In the same way, first we are a human beings
then we are realized souls.

00:52:39.620 --> 00:52:44.430
This is the new age, this is the new race
which has come up.

00:52:44.430 --> 00:52:52.980
Is nothing, just put a brand here, one, like
any other twice-born, like any other person

00:52:52.980 --> 00:52:53.980
you are behaving.

00:52:53.980 --> 00:52:54.980
Why?

00:52:54.980 --> 00:52:55.980
What is twice, twice-born?

00:52:55.980 --> 00:53:00.150
Or I am a Christian, and a Hindu, and a Muslim
or anything.

00:53:00.150 --> 00:53:07.480
It’s just a brand because anybody can commit
any murder, any sin, anything.

00:53:07.480 --> 00:53:12.690
So this transformation is your responsibility.

00:53:12.690 --> 00:53:19.220
You have to take to this transformation, and
you have to change people.

00:53:19.220 --> 00:53:26.780
If you have to save your country, now learn
this: that you can do it.

00:53:26.780 --> 00:53:28.770
You can easily do it.

00:53:28.770 --> 00:53:32.750
Is very simple because is all built in within
you.

00:53:32.750 --> 00:53:34.590
Now what do we do?

00:53:34.590 --> 00:53:38.090
Just put a seed in the Mother Earth and it
sprouts by itself.

00:53:38.090 --> 00:53:39.090
How?

00:53:39.090 --> 00:53:45.470
Because the seed has a built-in quality to
sprout and the Mother has a built-in quality

00:53:45.470 --> 00:53:47.800
to make it sprout.

00:53:47.800 --> 00:53:55.400
In the same way, you all have this power,
this glory is within you, just it has to happen.

00:53:55.400 --> 00:53:58.160
It sprouts and then you have to grow.

00:53:58.160 --> 00:54:02.440
I don’t know how people trust Me so much.

00:54:02.440 --> 00:54:04.360
I am an Indian after all.

00:54:04.360 --> 00:54:10.580
I could be an immigrant, or whatever.

00:54:10.580 --> 00:54:14.910
I could be anything.

00:54:14.910 --> 00:54:17.840
But they trust Me somehow.

00:54:17.840 --> 00:54:21.510
But later on, they do not trust themselves
and they do not grow.

00:54:21.510 --> 00:54:28.520
It’s a very sad thing, not in Russia, I
must tell you, not in Russia.

00:54:28.520 --> 00:54:30.300
There’s a joke.

00:54:30.300 --> 00:54:37.930
We had a seminar of thousands of people in
Russia and there was one American Sahaja Yogi

00:54:37.930 --> 00:54:45.450
and a Russian Sahaja Yogi asked him: “How
many do you have Sahaja Yogis in America?”

00:54:45.450 --> 00:54:51.760
So he said, “To be precise, it is fifty-six.”

00:54:51.760 --> 00:54:56.890
So this Sahaja Yogi from Taliatti says, “Oh
my God, you are fifty-six thousand?

00:54:56.890 --> 00:55:01.490
We have only twenty-one thousand here in Taliatti.”

00:55:01.490 --> 00:55:03.210
They can’t understand.

00:55:03.210 --> 00:55:08.350
They think Americans are very bright, very
smart people.

00:55:08.350 --> 00:55:11.660
There must be at least 56,000.

00:55:11.660 --> 00:55:18.680
Americans are known to be very intelligent,
very smart.

00:55:18.680 --> 00:55:23.550
So they’re taking to Coca Cola culture now.

00:55:23.550 --> 00:55:28.650
Russians, forty per cent, because they think
Americans, after all, you know, they take

00:55:28.650 --> 00:55:30.970
Coca Cola, they go to McDonald.

00:55:30.970 --> 00:55:32.290
They’re very smart people.

00:55:32.290 --> 00:55:39.251
They’re ruling all over the world and all
your junk which doesn’t sell here goes there

00:55:39.251 --> 00:55:43.690
and they are really trying to look like Americans,
you know.

00:55:43.690 --> 00:55:44.690
Whatever it is.

00:55:44.690 --> 00:55:53.020
Why I’m trying to say this, is the whole
world is looking at you.

00:55:53.020 --> 00:55:54.060
They follow you.

00:55:54.060 --> 00:55:59.000
This Hollywood doesn’t understand its own
responsibility.

00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:05.620
The whole world is following you and the way
they speak also English is very surprising

00:56:05.620 --> 00:56:07.320
is just like American English.

00:56:07.320 --> 00:56:10.990
I take about two days to understand that.

00:56:10.990 --> 00:56:16.730
But now in Russia they are speaking the same
English as you speak and it’s a difficult

00:56:16.730 --> 00:56:17.730
situation.

00:56:17.730 --> 00:56:25.460
So, you have to understand the second responsibility
that, as citizens of this great country, you

00:56:25.460 --> 00:56:29.880
have to lead the whole world into righteousness,
into morality, into constructive beautiful

00:56:29.880 --> 00:56:30.880
life.

00:56:30.880 --> 00:56:40.260
You have to enter in the Kingdom of God and
settle there, whatever may be your race, whatever

00:56:40.260 --> 00:56:45.090
may be your religion, or all these nonsensical
differences.

00:56:45.090 --> 00:56:50.540
But it’s very important and you’ll be
surprised, the first country I visited was

00:56:50.540 --> 00:56:51.890
America.

00:56:51.890 --> 00:56:57.470
I would say, first I went to Iran because
my brother was there but after that I came

00:56:57.470 --> 00:57:00.850
to America and I was surprised.

00:57:00.850 --> 00:57:05.330
How do they take to falsehood so easily?

00:57:05.330 --> 00:57:08.490
Even Indians who come here become stupid.

00:57:08.490 --> 00:57:10.380
I don’t know.

00:57:10.380 --> 00:57:11.380
Really.

00:57:11.380 --> 00:57:18.660
You won’t believe, this there’s a gentleman
who is organizing the marriage of Rama and

00:57:18.660 --> 00:57:19.660
Sita.

00:57:19.660 --> 00:57:21.090
I mean they were married long time back.

00:57:21.090 --> 00:57:23.400
But he’s organizing it in every place.

00:57:23.400 --> 00:57:27.250
Los Angeles one marriage, one in New York,
one in Philadelphia.

00:57:27.250 --> 00:57:31.410
All like that he is organizing.

00:57:31.410 --> 00:57:36.510
And here there were ten thousand people who
attended that wedding.

00:57:36.510 --> 00:57:42.830
The boy, means Rama, was ten-year old and
the girl was eight-year old.

00:57:42.830 --> 00:57:47.490
So this kind of nonsense, even Indians, they
would not do this in India.

00:57:47.490 --> 00:57:51.470
No, everybody will laugh at them.

00:57:51.470 --> 00:57:54.240
The another example if I give, you’ll be
shocked.

00:57:54.240 --> 00:57:58.900
There’s a lady, Maharani of Dhrangadhra
. She’s another mad woman and she has lost

00:57:58.900 --> 00:57:59.900
her husband.

00:57:59.900 --> 00:58:07.740
So she has got one man, she dressed him up
as a lady, and she calls him as “the goddess”

00:58:07.740 --> 00:58:09.790
she worships.

00:58:09.790 --> 00:58:12.370
I was shocked at the whole thing that they
are doing.

00:58:12.370 --> 00:58:15.360
So I said, “But you don’t have anybody
who follows you.”

00:58:15.360 --> 00:58:21.490
“No, no, we have many in Los Angeles.”

00:58:21.490 --> 00:58:25.580
Can you imagine?

00:58:25.580 --> 00:58:33.300
This there is another one now who makes the
pendulum move.

00:58:33.300 --> 00:58:38.530
The people who are lynched by him, I met them
in Washington.

00:58:38.530 --> 00:58:42.520
They told me, “Mother, we have sold out
our houses.

00:58:42.520 --> 00:58:43.920
Now we don’t know what to do.

00:58:43.920 --> 00:58:46.200
We have taken out our children from good schools.

00:58:46.200 --> 00:58:47.470
We have no money.”

00:58:47.470 --> 00:58:49.190
I said, “ So why?”

00:58:49.190 --> 00:58:51.510
"There was this gentleman from the TM, you
see.

00:58:51.510 --> 00:58:52.840
Pradeep Chopra is the name."

00:58:52.840 --> 00:58:57.740
Pradeep, to have such a nice name, I don’t
know who gave him this name.

00:58:57.740 --> 00:59:00.080
What his mother must have thought.

00:59:00.080 --> 00:59:04.200
So he said that, “Now, I can control the
minds of others, I’ll teach you how.”

00:59:04.200 --> 00:59:05.990
So he calls somebody.

00:59:05.990 --> 00:59:09.970
“Stand here” and he gives you a pendulum
in his hand.

00:59:09.970 --> 00:59:11.650
Now he says, “See, now he’ll move the
pendulum.”

00:59:11.650 --> 00:59:22.760
He moves the pendulum and people have given
up their houses, this, that, to this man.

00:59:22.760 --> 00:59:26.390
So I said, “How can you come and tell Me
this now?

00:59:26.390 --> 00:59:31.660
Have you come on this earth to move the pendulums?”

00:59:31.660 --> 00:59:40.040
I mean, this kind of stupidity, can’t understand.

00:59:40.040 --> 00:59:50.290
Then they said you can levitate three or four
feet like this.

00:59:50.290 --> 00:59:51.660
Already you have jams on the road.

00:59:51.660 --> 00:59:55.630
Why do you want to have such people moving
their three feet?

00:59:55.630 --> 01:00:02.690
Such stupid things they accept, such stupid
things.

01:00:02.690 --> 01:00:07.940
But the fellow of TM, the one who was their
very big master, he got epilepsy, so he came

01:00:07.940 --> 01:00:08.940
to me.

01:00:08.940 --> 01:00:10.440
By that time, he had become bankrupt.

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:15.849
He told Me: “I went to America and my guru
told me, your money is so much involved, so

01:00:15.849 --> 01:00:20.200
you have to tell then, I came without any
visa, without any passport.”

01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:23.110
His name is Peter Pierce.

01:00:23.110 --> 01:00:28.390
“And you have to tell them I can walk into
the wall, through the wall."

01:00:28.390 --> 01:00:29.390
"Then?"

01:00:29.390 --> 01:00:30.390
I said.

01:00:30.390 --> 01:00:33.670
"I told them and they all believed me.”

01:00:33.670 --> 01:00:35.590
“They all believed you?”

01:00:35.590 --> 01:00:36.590
“Yes.”

01:00:36.590 --> 01:00:38.460
“Professors, mathematicians, everybody believed
you?”

01:00:38.460 --> 01:00:39.460
“Yes.”

01:00:39.460 --> 01:00:41.880
How can they believe such nonsensical things?

01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:56.170
There is a saying by Guru Nanaka, “Satguru
wahi, jo sahib mili hai.”

01:00:56.170 --> 01:01:06.770
“The one who is the real master is the one
who makes you meet God, who makes you Divine.”

01:01:06.770 --> 01:01:10.600
And this is what you should expect.

01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:14.080
It looks difficult, is the easiest thing to
be Divine.

01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:17.100
You don’t have to jump, you don’t have
to waste money.

01:01:17.100 --> 01:01:18.540
Nothing of the kind.

01:01:18.540 --> 01:01:20.710
It’s all built in within you.

01:01:20.710 --> 01:01:23.050
Just have your awakening and enjoy.

01:01:23.050 --> 01:01:28.890
You don’t have to do anything like running
away from your homes, going to Himalayas,

01:01:28.890 --> 01:01:29.890
standing on your heads.

01:01:29.890 --> 01:01:30.890
Nothing needed.

01:01:30.890 --> 01:01:31.890
No austerities.

01:01:31.890 --> 01:01:33.270
You are already ready for it.

01:01:33.270 --> 01:01:36.220
You have done all this in your last lives.

01:01:36.220 --> 01:01:39.640
Now please don’t do all these things.

01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:42.090
You just get your Self-realization.

01:01:42.090 --> 01:01:44.300
So you become collectively conscious.

01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:51.350
You can feel on your fingertips vibrations
of another person, whether dead, living, or

01:01:51.350 --> 01:01:53.140
historical whatever it is.

01:01:53.140 --> 01:01:55.010
You can know.

01:01:55.010 --> 01:01:57.580
You know the absolute truth on your fingertips.

01:01:57.580 --> 01:02:07.310
But above all, because you become collectively
conscious, that is, a microcosm becomes the

01:02:07.310 --> 01:02:12.400
macrocosm, because a drop becomes the ocean.

01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:14.520
Who is the other?

01:02:14.520 --> 01:02:17.040
You become the part and parcel of one.

01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:28.460
So when it happens to you, it is very amazing
how you realize what powers you have.

01:02:28.460 --> 01:02:35.370
You can give realization to people, you can
cure them, you can enjoy yourself.

01:02:35.370 --> 01:02:38.850
You never get bored.

01:02:38.850 --> 01:02:46.500
So many powers you have which starts expressing
and when they start expressing, you’re amazed

01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:47.500
at yourself.

01:02:47.500 --> 01:02:52.500
This is what you must expect and not moving
of a pendulum.

01:02:52.500 --> 01:02:57.630
I’m sure today I’m not talking to stupid
people.

01:02:57.630 --> 01:03:00.156
Sahaja Yoga is not meant for idiotic people,
I must tell you.

01:03:00.156 --> 01:03:13.470
The kind of idiocity that has come I can’t
understand, because I used to worship Abraham

01:03:13.470 --> 01:03:20.290
Lincoln, used to worship and he gave us such
a great thing like democracy and how can this

01:03:20.290 --> 01:03:24.050
democracy be a demonocracy?

01:03:24.050 --> 01:03:35.350
There are seekers, but misled.

01:03:35.350 --> 01:03:46.010
Above all that happens to you, the highest
is that you jump into the ocean of joy…you

01:03:46.010 --> 01:03:49.790
just become joy.

01:03:49.790 --> 01:03:53.580
Joy is singular.

01:03:53.580 --> 01:03:59.710
Happiness and unhappiness are the two sides
of one coin.

01:03:59.710 --> 01:04:05.640
But joy is singular that you become the witness
the whole thing like a drama.

01:04:05.640 --> 01:04:15.800
It’s fun and you get out of your problems
and that’s how you know how to solve them.

01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:20.192
And above all, the bliss is there to help
you.

01:04:20.192 --> 01:04:23.860
You’ll be amazed how things work out.

01:04:23.860 --> 01:04:28.370
Meticulously in every way, even money-wise.

01:04:28.370 --> 01:04:33.200
There was a girl, lady from Toronto.

01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:35.390
She wanted to travel with me, come here.

01:04:35.390 --> 01:04:40.520
She’s very good, but she thought she hasn’t
got sufficient money and next day she got

01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:48.230
a check of $4,000 because she had paid some
money somewhere a long time back.

01:04:48.230 --> 01:04:54.410
This is just a very, very minimum.

01:04:54.410 --> 01:04:59.350
But the greatest thing is that you become
your own master.

01:04:59.350 --> 01:05:04.320
You know what chakras are there, you know
what you are doing.

01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:05.750
You know everything.

01:05:05.750 --> 01:05:12.720
It is not just like standing and moving a
pendulum nonsense but it is you know what’s

01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:13.720
wrong with anyone.

01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:20.700
Then you don’t talk about his face, about
his dress, how he walks but you talk about

01:05:20.700 --> 01:05:27.030
his centers, what centers are there and you
can cure.

01:05:27.030 --> 01:05:29.340
All this is your own.

01:05:29.340 --> 01:05:38.210
Last of all I have to tell you this Kundalini
is the power of pure desire and she is your

01:05:38.210 --> 01:05:42.470
individual mother.

01:05:42.470 --> 01:05:44.210
She knows everything about you.

01:05:44.210 --> 01:05:45.500
It’s all tape-recorded.

01:05:45.500 --> 01:05:48.580
So you don’t have to start judging yourself.

01:05:48.580 --> 01:05:54.330
She knows you and She is anxious to give you
self-realization.

01:05:54.330 --> 01:06:02.100
She takes up all the trouble on Herself and
gives you this beautiful thing which you call

01:06:02.100 --> 01:06:13.090
as self-realization and then you realize that
you are endowed with the power of Divine love.

01:06:13.090 --> 01:06:21.440
You become extremely dynamic; at the same
time you are extremely compassionate.

01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:31.200
You enjoy your virtues, you enjoy your love,
you enjoy others, you enjoy everything.

01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:33.620
Such a state is not difficult.

01:06:33.620 --> 01:06:44.890
Only thing you must understand that you are
here to become the Spirit.

01:06:44.890 --> 01:06:49.730
In this time try to say whatever is possible.

01:06:49.730 --> 01:06:52.080
I’m going tonight to New York.

01:06:52.080 --> 01:06:55.840
They always put me like a shuttlecock from
one place to another.

01:06:55.840 --> 01:06:57.330
So I have to go.

01:06:57.330 --> 01:07:01.390
But I’m very happy I saw so many of you
here.

01:07:01.390 --> 01:07:07.400
I hope you’ll be all responsible and will
look after your realization.

01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:20.340
Now I would request you that it cannot be
forced on you, it cannot be, because I respect

01:07:20.340 --> 01:07:22.460
your freedom.

01:07:22.460 --> 01:07:23.460
You have freedom.

01:07:23.460 --> 01:07:27.560
This is the Last Judgment: If you want to
go to Heaven, you are welcome, if you want

01:07:27.560 --> 01:07:31.130
to go to hell, you are welcome.

01:07:31.130 --> 01:07:34.550
I cannot force on you.

01:07:34.550 --> 01:07:43.220
So those who do not want to come for this
or do not want to have it, I cannot force,

01:07:43.220 --> 01:07:48.110
so I would request you, those who do not want
to have, can leave the hall.

01:07:48.110 --> 01:07:53.380
Would be better for others and those who want
to have it are welcome and I’m sure you

01:07:53.380 --> 01:07:54.380
all will have it.

01:07:54.380 --> 01:07:56.320
No doubt about it.

01:07:56.320 --> 01:07:59.520
No doubt.

01:07:59.520 --> 01:08:08.310
It will take hardly ten minutes for you to
get your realization, ten minutes.

01:08:08.310 --> 01:08:17.500
But you have to be little patient and you
have to also know that it is your pure desire

01:08:17.500 --> 01:08:22.500
that is going to give you.

01:08:22.500 --> 01:08:24.089
Just your pure desire.

01:08:24.089 --> 01:08:28.540
I’ve already told you that Kundalini knows
everything about you and you don’t have

01:08:28.540 --> 01:08:32.280
to judge yourself.

01:08:32.280 --> 01:08:39.670
So there are three conditions, very simple,
very, very simple.

01:08:39.670 --> 01:08:46.609
The first one is that you are not to feel
guilty at all.

01:08:46.609 --> 01:08:49.080
Your Kundalini knows everything.

01:08:49.080 --> 01:08:52.480
Why should you feel guilty?

01:08:52.480 --> 01:08:54.130
Leave it to Her.

01:08:54.130 --> 01:08:57.130
You don’t judge yourself and please don’t
feel guilty.

01:08:57.130 --> 01:09:04.850
You don’t know if you feel guilty, this
center here, catches, and if this center goes

01:09:04.850 --> 01:09:15.820
out of order, you develop angina which is
a horrible disease of the heart.

01:09:15.820 --> 01:09:20.020
You develop spondylitis and also lethargic
organs.

01:09:20.020 --> 01:09:26.550
Only by one this center of yours, and it is
always there when you feel guilty.

01:09:26.550 --> 01:09:31.190
If you have done anything wrong in the past,
you should have dealt with it that time.

01:09:31.190 --> 01:09:34.380
What’s the use of carrying it here all the
time?

01:09:34.380 --> 01:09:35.630
Also is conditioning.

01:09:35.630 --> 01:09:44.260
For small, small things people start feeling
guilty, specially with this Catholic Church,

01:09:44.260 --> 01:09:46.220
Christian churches.

01:09:46.220 --> 01:09:50.089
You have to know that we are sinners, we are
not.

01:09:50.089 --> 01:09:54.940
We are human beings and human beings can commit
mistakes.

01:09:54.940 --> 01:10:03.600
You are not gods and at this juncture, if
you have guilt, how will the Kundalini rise?

01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:10.340
If you are really guilty, you would have been
in jail, isn’t it?

01:10:10.340 --> 01:10:15.630
I don’t know with this law here, if people
can go to jail even if they have done something

01:10:15.630 --> 01:10:18.540
wrong, I have no idea.

01:10:18.540 --> 01:10:24.870
I, somehow or other, I’m very apprehensive
about the LA laws you see.

01:10:24.870 --> 01:10:29.610
They say it’s very funny.

01:10:29.610 --> 01:10:32.510
All right, whatever it is.

01:10:32.510 --> 01:10:40.880
Now God’s laws are extremely pure and He
loves you.

01:10:40.880 --> 01:10:45.540
He doesn’t want you, to put you into any
trouble.

01:10:45.540 --> 01:10:55.040
He loves you and loves you very much and He
wants you to enter into His kingdom to enjoy.

01:10:55.040 --> 01:11:01.810
Now you’re just ready to get it.

01:11:01.810 --> 01:11:06.250
So the first condition is that you are not
to feel guilty at all.

01:11:06.250 --> 01:11:11.200
I assure you, you have done nothing wrong.

01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:16.440
Is it possible to forgive yourself?

01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:17.990
Thank you.

01:11:17.990 --> 01:11:20.480
The second condition is even easier.

01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:25.150
If you understand, logically.

01:11:25.150 --> 01:11:37.360
If, I mean, the second condition is that you
have to forgive everyone, even without thinking

01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:38.360
about them.

01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:41.960
Just to say, “I forgive every one of them,”
finished.

01:11:41.960 --> 01:11:48.300
Is very difficult but logically, I’ll tell
you, whether you forgive or don’t forgive,

01:11:48.300 --> 01:11:49.690
what do you do?

01:11:49.690 --> 01:11:51.340
Do nothing.

01:11:51.340 --> 01:11:58.340
But if you don’t forgive, then you play
into wrong hands and torture yourself while

01:11:58.340 --> 01:12:01.670
the person who has tortured you, is very happy.

01:12:01.670 --> 01:12:07.410
You go on torturing yourself because you can’t
forgive.

01:12:07.410 --> 01:12:09.950
So just you have to say, “I forgive everyone.”

01:12:09.950 --> 01:12:14.850
Don’t think about them also because that
will give you a headache.

01:12:14.850 --> 01:12:15.851
Best is to forgive everyone.

01:12:15.851 --> 01:12:26.080
Once you forgive, then the Divine takes over
and works it out.

01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:29.190
So now please forgive everyone.

01:12:29.190 --> 01:12:32.570
Is there any problem?

01:12:32.570 --> 01:12:34.830
All right.

01:12:34.830 --> 01:12:44.970
The third condition is very simple is that
you have to take out your shoes.

01:12:44.970 --> 01:12:46.750
That’s all.

01:12:46.750 --> 01:12:52.470
You won’t believe, in London first time
I said, “Take out your shoes,” half of

01:12:52.470 --> 01:13:05.210
them walked out.

01:13:05.210 --> 01:13:13.700
It’s difficult.

01:13:13.700 --> 01:13:22.200
All right.

01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:32.700
So first of all we’ll show you what we have
to do to nourish our centers.

01:13:32.700 --> 01:13:34.570
Only for tonight, only for tonight.

01:13:34.570 --> 01:13:37.130
You don’t have to do it.

01:13:37.130 --> 01:13:45.710
Later on, as I told you that our centers are
here and all this is happening in a collective

01:13:45.710 --> 01:13:46.710
way.

01:13:46.710 --> 01:13:49.490
It’s not single person doing something at
home.

01:13:49.490 --> 01:13:50.610
So you have to go there.

01:13:50.610 --> 01:13:57.320
They’ll give you every instruction, everything,
every book, whatever you want.

01:13:57.320 --> 01:13:59.620
Free, absolutely free.

01:13:59.620 --> 01:14:04.750
But you must desire to grow and it will work
out.

01:14:04.750 --> 01:14:10.860
Some people get it immediately in such a big
way and then they think they’re on top of

01:14:10.860 --> 01:14:12.790
the world, but no.

01:14:12.790 --> 01:14:16.070
You have to grow and you have to know everything
about yourself.

01:14:16.070 --> 01:14:20.490
You have to know about Sahaja Yoga completely
in a full way.

01:14:20.490 --> 01:14:27.420
You have to be a master and I tell you hardly
it takes one month to be.

01:14:27.420 --> 01:14:30.110
You people are very intelligent and everything.

01:14:30.110 --> 01:14:32.500
Just put your attention, it will work out.

01:14:32.500 --> 01:14:34.630
All right.

01:14:34.630 --> 01:14:42.860
So now we have to put our left hand on our
lap just.

01:14:42.860 --> 01:14:50.640
(Mother speaks aside to someone in Hindi.)

01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:52.080
Just now.

01:14:52.080 --> 01:14:54.340
Left hand on your left lap, comfortably.

01:14:54.340 --> 01:14:58.710
We are not to go to Himalayas, do anything
of the kind.

01:14:58.710 --> 01:15:01.140
We have to be comfortable, that’s one thing.

01:15:01.140 --> 01:15:04.969
Here sitting down, you’ll get your realization.

01:15:04.969 --> 01:15:12.330
Left hand towards the photograph, we put here,
because they have objection for that, but

01:15:12.330 --> 01:15:22.910
now you put towards Me, left hand towards
Me which is symbolically saying that you want

01:15:22.910 --> 01:15:29.640
your self-realization because the left side
is the power of desire, mundane desire.

01:15:29.640 --> 01:15:35.460
So you’re desirous, so you are putting the
hand towards Me, left hand, that’s all.

01:15:35.460 --> 01:15:40.470
Now with the right hand, we have to nourish
our centers on the left-hand side.

01:15:40.470 --> 01:15:43.120
Now they will show you how to do.

01:15:43.120 --> 01:15:47.760
First we put our right hand on the heart.

01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:57.840
In the heart resides the Spirit which is the
reflection of God Almighty.

01:15:57.840 --> 01:16:07.830
If you become the Spirit then you become your
own master.

01:16:07.830 --> 01:16:13.960
So you take your hand on the upper portion
of your abdomen on the left-hand side and

01:16:13.960 --> 01:16:22.900
this is the center of your mastery which is
created by all the prophets.

01:16:22.900 --> 01:16:27.200
You will know about it, everything.

01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:32.190
Everything will be told to you.

01:16:32.190 --> 01:16:37.720
You have to put both your feet apart from
each other because these are also two powers

01:16:37.720 --> 01:16:40.610
on left and right.

01:16:40.610 --> 01:16:46.830
Now please take your hand in the lower portion
of your abdomen on the left-hand side.

01:16:46.830 --> 01:16:57.110
This is the center for pure, Divine knowledge.

01:16:57.110 --> 01:17:06.400
Don’t get disturbed with this, it’s very
simple, is the center for the pure, Divine

01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:08.460
knowledge to work out.

01:17:08.460 --> 01:17:22.360
Now you take your hand back to the upper portion
of your abdomen, press it which is the center

01:17:22.360 --> 01:17:24.830
of mastery.

01:17:24.830 --> 01:17:33.230
Now please take your right hand on top of
your heart which is the center of the pure

01:17:33.230 --> 01:17:35.810
Spirit.

01:17:35.810 --> 01:17:40.920
Now please take your right hand in the corner
of your neck and shoulder and turn your head

01:17:40.920 --> 01:17:41.920
to your right.

01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:47.950
Now this is the center I told you about that
when you feel guilty, this goes out of order

01:17:47.950 --> 01:17:57.350
and at this juncture you must keep this center
open by not feeling guilty at all.

01:17:57.350 --> 01:18:06.690
Now you raise your right hand on top of your
forehead across and put down your head.

01:18:06.690 --> 01:18:10.670
This is the center where you have to forgive
everyone.

01:18:10.670 --> 01:18:16.760
This center is extremely constricted and if
you don’t forgive, it won’t open.

01:18:16.760 --> 01:18:21.680
All your life you’ve tortured yourself and
if you don’t forgive now, you’ll have

01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:30.430
to miss this great opportunity of getting
your self-realization.

01:18:30.430 --> 01:18:37.290
Now take back your right hand on the back
side of your head and push back your head.

01:18:37.290 --> 01:18:46.810
Here, without feeling guilty, without counting
your mistakes, just for your satisfaction,

01:18:46.810 --> 01:18:53.850
you have to ask forgiveness from the all-pervading
Divine power of love.

01:18:53.850 --> 01:18:57.780
That we’ll do later after closing eyes,
but I’m just telling you how to do it.

01:18:57.780 --> 01:18:58.980
Now stretch your palm.

01:18:58.980 --> 01:19:02.130
This is the last center, very important.

01:19:02.130 --> 01:19:08.770
Stretch your palm and put the center of your
palm on top of the fontanelle bone area.

01:19:08.770 --> 01:19:10.150
Now please put down your head.

01:19:10.150 --> 01:19:11.190
They forget this.

01:19:11.190 --> 01:19:16.510
Please put down your head and push back your
fingers as far as possible.

01:19:16.510 --> 01:19:20.660
Just push back, so there’s a good pressure
on the scalp.

01:19:20.660 --> 01:19:30.180
Now please move your hand in such a way that
the scalp moves, clockwise, seven times.

01:19:30.180 --> 01:19:31.710
Do it very slowly.

01:19:31.710 --> 01:19:33.850
Put down your head, put down your heads.

01:19:33.850 --> 01:19:35.760
Please put down your heads.

01:19:35.760 --> 01:19:38.720
You must put down your head otherwise it doesn’t
work out better.

01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:39.790
Put down your head.

01:19:39.790 --> 01:19:41.830
Now push back your fingers.

01:19:41.830 --> 01:19:43.730
Pushing back your fingers is important.

01:19:43.730 --> 01:19:52.880
Push back your fingers outward, so that there’s
a pressure on the scalp.

01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:57.930
Now move it slowly seven times, clockwise.

01:19:57.930 --> 01:20:06.330
Don’t hold your head, push back your fingers.

01:20:06.330 --> 01:20:08.570
Please push back your fingers.

01:20:08.570 --> 01:20:09.700
That’s it.

01:20:09.700 --> 01:20:12.550
That’s all we have to do.

01:20:12.550 --> 01:20:18.010
Now, again, we put our feet apart from each
other.

01:20:18.010 --> 01:20:28.820
Put the left hand on your left lap and put
the right hand on the heart.

01:20:28.820 --> 01:20:33.540
Now please close your eyes and please don’t
open them till I tell you.

01:20:33.540 --> 01:20:40.410
You can take out your spectacles, if you like.

01:20:40.410 --> 01:20:55.521
Now when you put your hand on your heart,
you have to ask Me a question, very fundamental

01:20:55.521 --> 01:21:00.240
question about yourself: You can call Me Mother,
or Shri Mataji.

01:21:00.240 --> 01:21:06.070
Here, you please ask Me a question, in your
heart, three times.

01:21:06.070 --> 01:21:09.120
“Mother, am I the Spirit?”

01:21:09.120 --> 01:21:18.690
Ask this question three times in your heart.

01:21:18.690 --> 01:21:29.270
I’ve told you that if you become the Spirit,
you become your own master.

01:21:29.270 --> 01:21:35.630
So please take your right hand in the upper
portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side

01:21:35.630 --> 01:21:41.970
and press it hard and here you have to ask
another fundamental question about yourself.

01:21:41.970 --> 01:21:48.570
Three times, please ask in your heart: “Mother,
am I my own master?

01:21:48.570 --> 01:21:58.730
Mother, am I my own master?”

01:21:58.730 --> 01:22:08.010
I have told you that I respect your freedom
so I cannot force pure, Divine knowledge on

01:22:08.010 --> 01:22:09.010
you.

01:22:09.010 --> 01:22:10.170
You have to ask for it.

01:22:10.170 --> 01:22:17.920
So please take your right hand in the lower
portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side

01:22:17.920 --> 01:22:24.510
and here you have to say six times because
this center has got six petals.

01:22:24.510 --> 01:22:43.900
You have to ask, please ask six times: “Mother,
please give Me pure, Divine knowledge.”

01:22:43.900 --> 01:22:51.560
As soon as you ask for pure, Divine knowledge,
Kundalini starts rising upward.

01:22:51.560 --> 01:23:00.830
So we have to nourish our upper centers with
our full self-confidence.

01:23:00.830 --> 01:23:06.490
So now please raise your right hand in the
upper portion of your abdomen on the left

01:23:06.490 --> 01:23:15.640
hand side and here you have to say ten times:
“Mother, I am my own master.”

01:23:15.640 --> 01:23:26.130
Please say it ten times: “Mother, I am my
own master.”

01:23:26.130 --> 01:23:33.030
At the very outset I told you that you are
not this body, this mind, these emotions,

01:23:33.030 --> 01:23:42.960
this intellect, these conditionings, this
ego, but you are the pure Spirit.

01:23:42.960 --> 01:23:55.290
So now raise your right hand on top of your
heart and here please say twelve times with

01:23:55.290 --> 01:24:05.830
full self-confidence: “Mother, I am the
pure Spirit.

01:24:05.830 --> 01:24:11.540
Mother, I am the pure Spirit.”

01:24:11.540 --> 01:24:25.610
This all-pervading power of Divine love is
the ocean of knowledge.

01:24:25.610 --> 01:24:34.770
It is the ocean of blessings, it is the ocean
of compassion, but above all, it is the ocean

01:24:34.770 --> 01:24:40.330
of forgiveness and whatever mistakes you might
commit will be completely dissolved by the

01:24:40.330 --> 01:24:45.490
power of this ocean of forgiveness.

01:24:45.490 --> 01:24:50.980
So please forgive yourself and put your right
hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder

01:24:50.980 --> 01:25:03.020
and turn your head to your right.

01:25:03.020 --> 01:25:07.820
Here you have to say sixteen times: “Mother,
I am not guilty at all.”

01:25:07.820 --> 01:25:17.520
Please say with full self-confidence, sixteen
times: “Mother, I am not guilty at all.”

01:25:17.520 --> 01:25:24.750
I have already told you whether you forgive
or don’t forgive, you don’t do anything.

01:25:24.750 --> 01:25:31.280
But if you don’t forgive, then you play
into wrong hands and torture yourself.

01:25:31.280 --> 01:25:39.230
Specially at this time if you do not forgive,
this center of agnya won’t open and the

01:25:39.230 --> 01:25:41.370
Kundalini won’t be able to break through.

01:25:41.370 --> 01:25:47.040
So I request you again and again, just forgive
everyone.

01:25:47.040 --> 01:25:53.210
So now raise your right hand on top of your
forehead across and please put down your head.

01:25:53.210 --> 01:26:04.170
Here you have to say, from your heart, not
how many times: “Mother, I forgive everyone

01:26:04.170 --> 01:26:05.250
in general.”

01:26:05.250 --> 01:26:15.130
Please say it from your heart.

01:26:15.130 --> 01:26:23.770
Now without feeling guilty, without counting
mistakes, just for your satisfaction, you

01:26:23.770 --> 01:26:31.350
have to ask forgiveness from the all-pervading
Divine power.

01:26:31.350 --> 01:26:37.670
So please take your right hand back side of
your head and push back your head as far as

01:26:37.670 --> 01:26:40.160
possible.

01:26:40.160 --> 01:26:50.571
Here now you have to say again from the heart,
not how many times: “Oh, Divine power, if

01:26:50.571 --> 01:26:59.850
I’ve done anything wrong knowingly or unknowingly,
please forgive me.

01:26:59.850 --> 01:27:16.180
Oh, Divine power, if I have done anything
wrong, knowingly or unknowingly, please forgive

01:27:16.180 --> 01:27:18.720
me.”

01:27:18.720 --> 01:27:20.580
Now the last center.

01:27:20.580 --> 01:27:25.040
Please stretch your palm fully.

01:27:25.040 --> 01:27:32.460
Now carefully put the center of your palm
on top of the fontanelle bone area which was

01:27:32.460 --> 01:27:34.920
a soft bone in your childhood.

01:27:34.920 --> 01:27:38.310
Now please bend your head as much as you can.

01:27:38.310 --> 01:27:45.530
Now remember to stretch back your fingers
so there is a good pressure on your scalp.

01:27:45.530 --> 01:27:48.380
Here again, I respect your freedom.

01:27:48.380 --> 01:27:51.800
I cannot force self-realization on you.

01:27:51.800 --> 01:28:00.800
So you have to say seven times, moving the
scalp seven times, you have to say: “Mother,

01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:03.390
please give me my self-realization.

01:28:03.390 --> 01:28:06.950
Mother, please give me my self-realization.”

01:28:06.950 --> 01:28:17.520
Now move the scalp seven times clockwise slowly.

01:28:17.520 --> 01:28:52.260
(Mother blows into the microphone.)

01:28:52.260 --> 01:28:56.550
Now please take down your hand.

01:28:56.550 --> 01:29:05.400
Open your eyes, slowly.

01:29:05.400 --> 01:29:17.050
Now please put both the hands towards Me like
this and try not to think.

01:29:17.050 --> 01:29:25.280
Now bend your head and see with your left
hand, right hand towards Me, the left hand,

01:29:25.280 --> 01:29:34.000
you feel if there is a hot or a cold breeze,
like vibrations, coming out of your fontanelle

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:35.100
bone area.

01:29:35.100 --> 01:29:36.560
Please put down your head.

01:29:36.560 --> 01:29:40.750
Now please don’t put the hand on top but
little away.

01:29:40.750 --> 01:29:42.740
Some people get it further away.

01:29:42.740 --> 01:29:51.410
So please move your hand and see for yourself
if there’s a cool or hot breeze, like vibrations,

01:29:51.410 --> 01:29:55.980
coming out of your fontanelle bone area.

01:29:55.980 --> 01:30:02.040
Now if they’re not coming, you should say:
“Mother, please come through my head.

01:30:02.040 --> 01:30:05.910
Mother, please come through my head.”

01:30:05.910 --> 01:30:11.070
Please say thrice.

01:30:11.070 --> 01:30:12.800
Umm.

01:30:12.800 --> 01:30:17.400
Now please put the left hand like this, and
with the right hand try to see if there’s

01:30:17.400 --> 01:30:27.400
a cool breeze or a hot breeze like vibration
coming from your fontanelle bone area.

01:30:27.400 --> 01:30:33.640
Now if you have not forgiven you, or if are
not yourself, or if you are not forgiving

01:30:33.640 --> 01:30:36.740
others, it will be hot.

01:30:36.740 --> 01:30:38.750
But now try to forgive.

01:30:38.750 --> 01:30:40.360
Forgive yourself and forgive others.

01:30:40.360 --> 01:30:45.730
It will cool down, I’m sure it will cool
down.

01:30:45.730 --> 01:30:52.330
Now once more only, please put your right
hand towards me and again put down the head

01:30:52.330 --> 01:31:02.270
and with the left hand, please try to see
if there’s a cool or hot breeze like vibrations

01:31:02.270 --> 01:31:05.770
coming out of your fontanelle bone area.

01:31:05.770 --> 01:31:12.590
This is the actualization of baptism.

01:31:12.590 --> 01:31:17.860
This is what is the Brahmarandhra Bheda that
they call it.

01:31:17.860 --> 01:31:22.910
Now it’s done.

01:31:22.910 --> 01:31:27.970
Don’t doubt.

01:31:27.970 --> 01:31:36.090
Now please raise both the hands towards the
sky and push back your head and ask any one

01:31:36.090 --> 01:31:39.200
of these questions, three questions, three
times.

01:31:39.200 --> 01:31:46.560
First one is: “Mother, is this the cool
breeze of the holy Ghost?”

01:31:46.560 --> 01:31:54.090
Or, you can ask: “Mother, is this the all-pervading
power of Divine love?”

01:31:54.090 --> 01:32:01.860
Or you can ask: “Mother, is this the paramchaitanya
or ruh?”

01:32:01.860 --> 01:32:05.550
Ask any one of these questions three times.

01:32:05.550 --> 01:32:13.330
Take down your hands.

01:32:13.330 --> 01:32:16.780
Such cool is coming from you to Me now.

01:32:16.780 --> 01:32:20.810
Now don’t doubt that it’s air-conditioning
or nothing is not: air-conditioning is not

01:32:20.810 --> 01:32:24.480
in your head, is coming out of your head.

01:32:24.480 --> 01:32:28.690
So don’t doubt yourself.

01:32:28.690 --> 01:32:36.770
All those who have felt cool breeze or hot
breeze on your fingertips, on your palms or

01:32:36.770 --> 01:32:46.560
through your fontanelle bone area, please
raise both your hands.

01:32:46.560 --> 01:32:47.990
Aah!

01:32:47.990 --> 01:32:56.030
All Americans have got it!

01:32:56.030 --> 01:32:58.010
Aah!

01:32:58.010 --> 01:32:59.860
I bow to you, all saints.

01:32:59.860 --> 01:33:00.930
I bow to you.

01:33:00.930 --> 01:33:01.930
(To one person) You didn’t feel, sir?

01:33:01.930 --> 01:33:04.220
What’s the matter with you?

01:33:04.220 --> 01:33:08.740
You didn’t feel it, the cool breeze?

01:33:08.740 --> 01:33:09.960
No?

01:33:09.960 --> 01:33:14.860
You’re the only person.

01:33:14.860 --> 01:33:16.090
Why?

01:33:16.090 --> 01:33:17.670
Just put your hands; it will work out.

01:33:17.670 --> 01:33:26.500
Just put both the feet apart.

01:33:26.500 --> 01:33:33.640
Now?

01:33:33.640 --> 01:33:36.630
Are you a doctor?

01:33:36.630 --> 01:33:42.680
[Mother asks a yogi to work on him.]

01:33:42.680 --> 01:33:45.320
Anybody can see that.

01:33:45.320 --> 01:33:49.790
[I.e., see the vibrations, Ed.]

01:33:49.790 --> 01:33:54.430
It’s all right.

01:33:54.430 --> 01:34:02.490
Now all those who have not felt, are there
any?

01:34:02.490 --> 01:34:06.420
One, two, three, four.

01:34:06.420 --> 01:34:09.370
(This one, two.

01:34:09.370 --> 01:34:18.550
Three, four is not in the cassette)
