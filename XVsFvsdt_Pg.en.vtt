00:00.000 --> 00:00.845
Evening Program Day 1, Delphi, 1999

00:00.845 --> 00:03.040
After such

00:03.040 --> 00:05.660
beautiful

00:05.660 --> 00:06.160
divine

00:06.160 --> 00:06.660
music,

00:07.500 --> 00:09.280
I don’t know what to say.

00:10.035 --> 00:11.035
The,

00:12.235 --> 00:15.355
even the heart of all the Deities

00:15.425 --> 00:18.545
must be jumping with joy

00:18.545 --> 00:20.275
as you all were jumping with joy.

00:21.395 --> 00:23.035
It’s such a unison,

00:23.945 --> 00:25.115
the oneness

00:26.225 --> 00:28.105
with all the musicians

00:28.805 --> 00:31.015
and the celestial musicians it was.

00:31.685 --> 00:34.635
It was really a tremendous

00:34.635 --> 00:35.635
experience of joy.

00:36.525 --> 00:37.525


00:39.555 --> 00:40.835
I must thank

00:41.385 --> 00:42.945
the people who have come

00:43.405 --> 00:46.085
all the way from Benin,

00:47.105 --> 00:50.155
they did so well, I mean, I just don’t know

00:50.435 --> 00:53.915
how rhythmically they always

00:53.925 --> 00:56.645
have been dancing.

00:56.645 --> 00:58.185
And in something in them,

00:58.985 --> 01:01.365
in the African people I’ve seen,

01:01.695 --> 01:02.725
they have

01:03.825 --> 01:05.165
such a lot of rhythm,

01:05.945 --> 01:08.865
all the time they are rhythmic:

01:08.865 --> 01:11.740
they’ll walk rhythmically, they’ll talk rhythmically.

01:12.020 --> 01:13.140
It’s sort of- I think sometimes –

01:13.475 --> 01:14.475
"Ke"

01:14.760 --> 01:17.500
Shri Shiva is acting through them.

01:17.620 --> 01:20.880
All the time this rhythm is so beautifully done

01:20.880 --> 01:23.960
and the way they change it, make it patterns,

01:23.960 --> 01:26.480
and double it, triple it

01:26.480 --> 01:28.980
and suddenly new patterns come out.

01:28.980 --> 01:29.480


01:29.480 --> 01:31.480


01:31.480 --> 01:34.040
[Aside] Now what is the other country, this one I don’t know.

01:34.040 --> 01:35.480
Other country?

01:35.480 --> 01:38.140
Sahaja Yogini: Ivory Coast

01:40.840 --> 01:43.160
Then comes Ivory Cost.

01:43.680 --> 01:47.620
And the people of Ivory Coast are also very remarkable.

01:47.620 --> 01:48.120


01:48.360 --> 01:51.080
I was surprised the way

01:51.080 --> 01:53.195
the ladies also were dancing

01:53.200 --> 01:56.240
absolutely full of, full of rhythm.

01:56.720 --> 01:59.660
I mean all of you should learn rhythm from them.

01:59.660 --> 02:06.620
That is something so important to understand

02:06.620 --> 02:08.760
and

02:08.760 --> 02:09.260


02:09.260 --> 02:12.100
to enjoy music

02:12.300 --> 02:13.620
and to enjoy Sahaj.

02:13.660 --> 02:15.840
You see, it's like a-

02:15.840 --> 02:20.020
I see so many lights there

02:20.020 --> 02:24.860
as if I felt you all got the lights in your throat, in your eyes,

02:24.860 --> 02:27.580
also in your Sahasrara.

02:27.580 --> 02:28.080


02:28.085 --> 02:30.775
It was a wonderful time.

02:30.780 --> 02:36.320
So we must thank them especially these two people who have come all the way to entertain us

02:36.320 --> 02:38.800
and to make us enjoy everything.

02:38.800 --> 02:40.120
So we have to be very thankful.

02:40.120 --> 02:40.620


02:41.040 --> 02:46.240
And how, see, so much far away they are otherwise,

02:46.240 --> 02:49.660
but how they have become so much one with us.

02:49.660 --> 02:50.160


02:50.160 --> 02:54.620
We must thank the French for this, that they went

02:55.000 --> 02:55.500


02:55.500 --> 02:58.000
and governed those countries.

02:58.220 --> 03:00.860
By their governing them, they came close to us!

03:01.040 --> 03:05.600
If they had not governed them, there would have been no possibility of meeting them so soon.

03:05.600 --> 03:06.560


03:06.560 --> 03:11.160
So it’s such a beautiful combination, oneness

03:11.160 --> 03:12.300
with all of us

03:12.460 --> 03:14.480
and I must thank you again and again.

03:17.060 --> 03:20.060
Then we have another little thing

03:20.060 --> 03:23.080
which is very important at least to do.

03:23.080 --> 03:25.740
I’ve seen now such a genius,

03:25.740 --> 03:28.400
there is one genius born

03:28.580 --> 03:33.680
and he must be a great musician in his last life

03:33.680 --> 03:34.720
I’m sure!

03:34.720 --> 03:40.260
The way he handles the violin,

03:40.260 --> 03:41.640
I can’t believe it.

03:41.760 --> 03:46.220
But [unsure] he can play without notations or without something, is a miracle.

03:46.220 --> 03:46.720


03:47.020 --> 03:51.340
And if that has happened because of Sahaja Yoga, I must say Sahaja Yoga itself

03:51.340 --> 03:52.460
is a miracle

03:52.640 --> 03:56.860
And then he took to Indian classical music,

03:56.860 --> 03:57.960
he was playing

03:58.740 --> 04:01.760
very deftly, absolutely so well,

04:01.840 --> 04:05.920
I was amazed how a talented person like him

04:05.920 --> 04:07.300
can take to any kind of music.

04:07.300 --> 04:07.800


04:08.380 --> 04:12.520
And Babamama has already told Me that: “Your Sahaja Yogis are really talented.

04:12.520 --> 04:13.020


04:13.380 --> 04:18.840
They are very talented people. Otherwise, how could they take to this difficult,

04:18.840 --> 04:21.100
classical, Indian music?

04:21.100 --> 04:23.040
Not only they have taken it but they have mastered it.”

04:23.040 --> 04:23.540


04:23.920 --> 04:26.740
Now, we had on tabla another French man

04:26.760 --> 04:31.680
whom I had not seen for the last - I think-  three, four years,

04:31.680 --> 04:32.180


04:32.180 --> 04:34.500
but I think now he has mastered it.

04:34.500 --> 04:37.480
The way he plays is really very remarkable.

04:37.480 --> 04:40.195
I was surprised how he could play.

04:40.200 --> 04:44.460
And then is this gentleman who played ” [raag] Malkans” to you.

04:44.460 --> 04:46.320
It’s a very difficult raga.

04:46.340 --> 04:50.860
In that one swara, we call them “madewa”,

04:50.860 --> 04:51.360


04:51.360 --> 04:56.400
that is being taken away from the main team [range]

04:56.400 --> 05:01.060
and also the - I don’t know English word –

05:01.060 --> 05:03.180
the “pa” [sol] is also removed.

05:03.180 --> 05:03.680


05:03.680 --> 05:08.300
It’s a very difficult, very melodious and not easily

05:08.300 --> 05:09.540


05:09.540 --> 05:12.340
learnt his Malkans raag.

05:12.600 --> 05:16.340
I’m surprised how these people in such a short time

05:16.340 --> 05:18.460
have mastered such a difficult raga

05:18.460 --> 05:18.960


05:18.960 --> 05:22.580
for which in India, Indians, have to work years together!

05:23.140 --> 05:26.175
But you, being even not Indian,

05:26.180 --> 05:28.760
you have never heard these notes

05:28.880 --> 05:32.340
and how you have achieved this mastery is beyond Me.

05:32.460 --> 05:37.700
It’s a real, I must say, the greatest blessing of Sahaja Yoga is

05:37.700 --> 05:39.280
that it has given you rhythm,

05:39.460 --> 05:42.540
it has given you “swarasasana”, means the notes.

05:42.540 --> 05:45.780
You are not weaving out from the notes.

05:45.780 --> 05:48.540
I’m not myself,  I myself

05:48.540 --> 05:49.040
don’t sing myself,

05:49.040 --> 05:50.900
I used to once upon a time

05:51.100 --> 05:56.360
but my family is so much in music that it has gone into my heart, into my mind.

05:56.360 --> 05:56.860


05:56.860 --> 05:58.980
And when I see this, I say: “Look at that!

05:59.340 --> 06:01.500
How these people have come out!”

06:01.620 --> 06:02.120


06:02.120 --> 06:05.880
The last but not the least is this lady, Ana.

06:06.120 --> 06:07.080
Sahaja Yogini: Anne.

06:07.080 --> 06:09.080
Who is another master.

06:09.200 --> 06:11.860
Well, they're all masters can you imagine?

06:11.860 --> 06:14.480
This little boy is already a master.

06:14.480 --> 06:17.540
But the ways he's accompanying Indian music, I mean,

06:17.540 --> 06:18.460
I’m amazed at him.

06:18.960 --> 06:22.840
In the same way, this lady the way she was rendering very difficult ragas,

06:22.840 --> 06:24.180


06:24.180 --> 06:27.280
with such deftness with such perfection.

06:27.280 --> 06:27.780


06:28.680 --> 06:32.660
I mean, I'm going to now take this film to India.

06:32.660 --> 06:33.160


06:33.160 --> 06:38.560
They have been asking Me: “Mother why don’t you give your episodes, your programs to us.

06:38.560 --> 06:39.060


06:39.060 --> 06:42.780
We’d like to broadcast it from the Television.”

06:42.780 --> 06:45.480
Now I’ll say: “Look at this, you see this,

06:45.480 --> 06:47.920
And they will all jump at it I tell you.

06:48.080 --> 06:50.880
They will have it and they will do it

06:50.880 --> 06:56.020
and they’ll be so amazed that how could, with Sahaja Yoga, you could master these things.

06:56.020 --> 06:56.520


06:56.800 --> 06:58.800
And see the oneness of us.

06:59.520 --> 07:02.420
You are from this country you are from that country,

07:02.760 --> 07:06.360
and also speak different languages

07:06.360 --> 07:06.860


07:06.860 --> 07:11.620
and you understand different words,

07:11.620 --> 07:12.120
everything differently.

07:12.180 --> 07:14.820
But when it comes to Sahaja bhajans,

07:14.860 --> 07:18.460
I don’t know how you get completely one with it.

07:19.840 --> 07:23.300
That shows that Sahaja Yoga is going to bring the whole world together

07:23.300 --> 07:25.760
through its music and through

07:25.760 --> 07:26.260


07:26.260 --> 07:28.060
its manifestation.

07:29.760 --> 07:33.280
I am really very much honoured, I am thankful to all the artists,

07:33.280 --> 07:34.220
all of you

07:34.440 --> 07:36.700
for such beautiful rendering.

07:36.920 --> 07:41.420
For all the ladies who have come here, I wish I was young to learn their dancing.

07:41.420 --> 07:42.300
But I’m not.

07:52.500 --> 07:54.540
Also,  I used to sing very well

07:54.680 --> 07:59.840
But because of lecturing and all that I think I’ve lost that capacity to sing.

07:59.840 --> 08:00.340


08:01.480 --> 08:06.580
Now you see, after you see this, it’s like a reflection of your heart,

08:06.740 --> 08:07.240


08:07.240 --> 08:10.980
it’s the reflection of your ideas about your ideal, your visions.

08:11.200 --> 08:16.000
You see this world singing together the song of Divinity.

08:16.000 --> 08:16.940


08:16.940 --> 08:21.960
It’s something nobody would believe, that we have such a good group of people here.

08:21.960 --> 08:22.775


08:22.780 --> 08:25.740
I’m thankful to you all and to the audience

08:25.780 --> 08:30.200
who have joined and have shown their beautiful

08:30.200 --> 08:30.700


08:30.700 --> 08:34.660
oneness and also the expression of their joy.

08:34.660 --> 08:36.980
May God bless you all.
