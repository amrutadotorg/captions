WEBVTT

00:44.408 --> 00:51.036
Today we have gathered here to do
the Navaratri Puja.

00:53.640 --> 00:59.493
There were nine times when the major
incarnations

00:59.694 --> 01:04.633
of the Mother of this universe

01:07.135 --> 01:13.266
were manifested. They were manifested
with a purpose.

01:13.620 --> 01:23.455
That purpose is to protect Her bhaktas,
Her disciples, Her children.

01:23.727 --> 01:26.657
This was

01:31.499 --> 01:42.520
a binding love, She could not escape it.

01:42.721 --> 01:48.292
Mother's love is binding, She cannot
escape it

01:48.493 --> 01:54.618
and She has to manifest it, work it out

01:54.826 --> 01:59.900
and give that protection to all
Her children.

02:02.560 --> 02:08.259
This protection in the modern times
has taken another form.

02:08.460 --> 02:15.666
In those days, the evil was trying

02:15.867 --> 02:22.014
to harm, to destroy the people who were
righteous,

02:22.215 --> 02:26.081
who were bhaktas, who were doing
good things,

02:26.282 --> 02:31.847
who wanted to lead a very religious life.

02:32.048 --> 02:37.615
So to save them, She incarnated.
To protect them, She incarnated.

02:37.816 --> 02:42.367
But they knew what was good, they knew
what was wrong.

02:43.464 --> 02:49.026
And they wanted to preserve their good
life, their precious life.

02:49.227 --> 02:52.950
They didn't care for money, they didn't
care for power,

02:53.151 --> 02:56.892
but just they wanted their life,

02:57.093 --> 03:02.148
means they wanted to be alive to worship
the Goddess.

03:02.349 --> 03:06.697
And when they were troubled or harmed
or destroyed

03:06.898 --> 03:10.398
by these evil forces, She had to manifest.

03:10.599 --> 03:14.618
But in modern times it's become
very complicated

03:14.819 --> 03:18.256
as the modern times are complicated.

03:18.464 --> 03:21.210
First of all,

03:21.979 --> 03:28.027
in the mind, in the lifestyle,
in the society

03:28.228 --> 03:34.597
of good human beings, righteous human
beings,

03:35.490 --> 03:40.779
fear of the wrong has entered.

03:40.980 --> 03:45.686
Like they are afraid say of their priests,
of their churches,

03:45.887 --> 03:50.340
of their temples, of their mosques,
which are all false.

03:50.541 --> 03:54.553
They are not afraid of God, they don't
believe in God.

03:54.722 --> 03:59.909
They think they have created God and they
can manage God. So who is God?

04:00.110 --> 04:04.048
The way they behave you can see clearly
that they do not recognize

04:04.249 --> 04:09.796
the existence of God, God Almighty who is
a wrathful God.

04:09.997 --> 04:13.757
They are not at all worried as to what
will happen to them.

04:13.958 --> 04:18.754
They don't even believe in the second life,
they don't believe in the resurrection.

04:18.955 --> 04:25.473
They are very short-sighted, evil people
doing all kinds of evil things.

04:25.674 --> 04:30.194
So somehow or other, as soon as you
are born,

04:30.395 --> 04:33.921
you are born into some sort of a brand,

04:34.122 --> 04:39.614
you are this, you are that, you are that,
you are that, as soon as you are born.

04:39.815 --> 04:42.483
So the first brand comes onto this
modern man,

04:42.684 --> 04:47.236
is of what religion to which he belongs.

04:47.634 --> 04:53.494
He can't avoid it, he has to be jolly well
belonging to some religion.

04:53.695 --> 04:57.240
You go anywhere, even in the passport -
nowadays they have stopped it -

04:57.441 --> 05:02.101
otherwise they used to ask: "What is
your religion?"

05:03.231 --> 05:08.513
And in India if you said you had no
religion they would not give you a passport

05:08.714 --> 05:12.294
because you are not yet qualified
evil person,

05:12.495 --> 05:16.855
or you are not following qualified
evil people.

05:17.056 --> 05:25.505
So that very simple gullible good people,
very righteous believers of God,

05:25.706 --> 05:32.592
developed this kind of a fear which was put
into their heads by these false people.

05:32.793 --> 05:35.452
That if you don't do like this, if you
don't pay money to us,

05:35.653 --> 05:38.091
then God will be wrathful.

05:38.292 --> 05:47.100
If you do not come to the confession,
then God will be angry with you,

05:47.301 --> 05:51.432
if you do not tolerate our nonsense,
God will be angry with you.

05:51.633 --> 05:58.218
All these things started going into
the brains of the people very easily.

05:58.419 --> 06:03.023
In some religion they believe there is
no sin in drinking.

06:03.224 --> 06:08.236
In some religion they believe there is
no sin in marrying many women.

06:08.437 --> 06:12.685
In some religion they believe that you
can have caste system.

06:12.886 --> 06:21.141
All is anti-God, absolutely anti-God
activity perpetuated into the society

06:21.342 --> 06:27.440
by these priests who are supposed to be
in charge of the religion.

06:27.641 --> 06:34.587
So the first horrible conditioning we have
when we start Sahaja Yoga is this.

06:36.993 --> 06:41.488
So to start something afresh they find it
very difficult.

06:42.761 --> 06:50.616
So the first protection Mother had
to render is from this conditioning.

06:51.370 --> 06:54.765
The second one is that of the country.

06:54.966 --> 06:58.640
Either you belong to this country,
to that country, or to that country.

06:58.841 --> 07:09.084
And these days every country is competing
with each other in all kinds of

07:11.441 --> 07:17.255
corruption, mafia, all kinds of things,
every country.

07:17.456 --> 07:20.289
Suddenly you discover.

07:20.982 --> 07:24.017
You have faith in one country, you find,
oh no, no, they were supporting

07:24.218 --> 07:28.600
certain person secretly.

07:28.808 --> 07:31.469
So whether they are democratic or anything,

07:31.670 --> 07:36.561
there is a kind of a mafia working
everywhere under some name.

07:36.762 --> 07:43.063
So the so-called laws also are only
for people who are simple, gullible,

07:43.264 --> 07:47.710
pure citizens, and not for the people
who put those laws on them.

07:47.911 --> 07:51.310
They take bribes, they take all kinds
of things, but still

07:51.511 --> 07:56.476
they are supposed to be in charge of law,
doing all kinds of illegal things,

07:56.677 --> 08:00.851
because they have made the law, so they
know how to be illegal.

08:01.057 --> 08:06.575
So this is the second type of fear that is
in the minds of the modern time.

08:06.776 --> 08:12.692
Then the third thing was the war.
Wars after wars came in,

08:12.893 --> 08:18.459
so many people developed a kind of a fear
about war,

08:18.660 --> 08:23.943
and as a reaction they developed a kind
of a stupid ego,

08:24.151 --> 08:27.850
just they said, to protect themselves.

08:28.861 --> 08:34.896
In protection, themselves, they have
built up a big ego

08:35.097 --> 08:42.762
and they are now becoming very,
we should say, aggressive people.

08:44.946 --> 08:54.696
So this kind of a wider range,
I should say, of fear,

08:54.897 --> 09:01.075
it can be directed into any direction,
it can be directed towards anyone.

09:01.276 --> 09:09.223
Then comes - is the fear of race -
racialism.

09:09.424 --> 09:14.994
Now I'm told that neo-nazism is taking
its own course

09:15.195 --> 09:18.832
and is coming up like a little snake.

09:21.436 --> 09:27.283
So this is another area which is very
dangerous now, working out.

09:29.919 --> 09:35.032
Now in the minds of seekers -
in their seeking,

09:35.233 --> 09:37.790
they have been to many gurus, they have
read all kinds of books

09:37.991 --> 09:41.783
but they were seeking, you know. !!!!!!AAAAAAAAA
They can, they were seeking, yet...

09:41.984 --> 09:45.333
drink any kind of water, develop all kinds
of diseases, what can you do?

09:45.534 --> 09:50.678
You are seeking after all, you are thirsty.
It has to be excused.

09:50.879 --> 09:53.646
And that's how they develop lots
of problems,

09:53.847 --> 09:56.982
not only in their body but also
in their brain.

09:57.183 --> 10:00.900
And now it's a very delicate thing.
If you tell somebody

10:01.101 --> 10:04.268
that you have been to such and such guru,
he doesn't want to hear

10:04.469 --> 10:07.811
because for him now the guru has become
the last word.

10:08.012 --> 10:11.133
You cannot say anything against his guru.

10:11.334 --> 10:14.882
Now when he starts suffering, then he may
accept,

10:15.083 --> 10:18.071
but to take it out that guru is also
very delicate

10:18.272 --> 10:22.468
because if you want to take out that guru,
then he might be hurt.

10:22.669 --> 10:26.457
So it's a very delicate operation.

10:27.895 --> 10:32.285
Then the modern society, the less said
the better.

10:32.486 --> 10:36.901
The norms of modern society are given
to us by people

10:37.102 --> 10:43.474
who were characterless like Freud, who had
no sense of morality,

10:43.675 --> 10:47.977
or by drunkards, though they don't have
any statues of drunkards.

10:48.178 --> 10:54.586
But most of them, if you see the abandonment
of our value system comes through drinking.

10:54.787 --> 10:57.940
And the drinking was there but not
to this extent, I mean,

10:58.141 --> 11:01.417
everybody was not a drunkard, these days
everybody can be a drunkard.

11:01.618 --> 11:04.628
And there's no shame about it.
With that drinking

11:04.799 --> 11:12.734
our value system started dropping down
and people have accepted now,

11:12.935 --> 11:17.521
the normal thing is abandonment.
This is another way.

11:20.118 --> 11:24.907
Formerly the parents used to support
the person if he would take to God,

11:25.108 --> 11:28.813
if he would take to righteous life
or to something higher.

11:29.014 --> 11:32.796
And if they saw these qualities in their
child they used to be happy,

11:32.997 --> 11:37.673
but these days the other way round,
the parents don't like it.

11:39.159 --> 11:42.713
As if the parents have lost everything
in themselves,

11:42.914 --> 11:48.234
so they want to hold on to their children,
grandchildren and possess them.

11:48.923 --> 11:52.466
And brainless creatures, because their
brain has been already washed out,

11:52.667 --> 11:58.424
there's nothing in their brains. To fight
the parents also is a big problem.

11:58.625 --> 12:02.325
So this kind of a fear is also there, that:
"My mother should not know,

12:02.526 --> 12:06.392
my father should not know," this, that.

12:07.164 --> 12:10.498
You can say from all sides

12:12.150 --> 12:17.936
the fear is burning, like flames.

12:18.137 --> 12:25.419
And we are now here, in Kali Yuga, we have
started Sahaja Yoga.

12:28.357 --> 12:37.649
So the way we have to work out
our protection has to be mutual.

12:37.850 --> 12:44.551
Mother of course is there to protect you
all the time,

12:44.752 --> 12:47.940
Her powers are there to protect you.

12:48.141 --> 12:52.632
But surprisingly in the modern times,

12:52.833 --> 12:57.669
there's one condition which has to be
fulfilled.

12:59.459 --> 13:04.804
Because in those days good were good

13:05.005 --> 13:10.025
and evil were evil, there was no mixing up.

13:10.734 --> 13:13.658
So once they asked for Goddess, they
accepted Her,

13:13.859 --> 13:17.246
She came in Her real form and She worked
it out.

13:17.447 --> 13:22.367
But in modern times, you must know that
all these evil things

13:22.568 --> 13:26.876
are also lingering in your head, little bit
here and there.

13:27.077 --> 13:29.491
People are extremely superficial,

13:29.692 --> 13:36.889
they are very much prone to the mass
attitude, fashions, things like that.

13:37.090 --> 13:42.094
Sort of, their personality is not that
developed as that

13:42.295 --> 13:46.794
of those bhaktas who knew they were right,
who knew they were righteous,

13:46.995 --> 13:49.044
who knew whatever they were doing
was correct

13:49.245 --> 13:56.195
and were standing on their legs firm.

13:56.396 --> 14:05.208
So the modern Sahaja Yogi is very different
from the Sahaja Yogi of olden times.

14:05.409 --> 14:11.954
Because in the olden times it was not easy
to get Realization.

14:12.250 --> 14:17.056
One in a billion, or in a trillion.

14:18.422 --> 14:23.150
And they had to work very hard, so as they
worked hard, very hard,

14:23.351 --> 14:28.176
they got cleansed and built up themselves,
you see, and toiled.

14:28.377 --> 14:33.111
Like any art piece which takes time,
is done with care,

14:33.282 --> 14:36.376
is definitely thousand times better than
these modern artists

14:36.577 --> 14:39.333
just putting two, three lines like this.

14:39.534 --> 14:43.829
So the today's human being is like a modern
artist, you see.

14:44.030 --> 14:47.586
You put one line and you say: "You must
see this into that person,

14:47.787 --> 14:51.108
you must have an identity." I mean,
what identity people can have?

14:51.309 --> 14:55.794
With one line, you say, find out
the identity.

14:58.325 --> 15:02.917
So the Sahaja Yogis which are today here,
have to realize

15:03.118 --> 15:10.488
that all these things are surrounding us,
and these evil forces are also there.

15:10.689 --> 15:14.937
There are some within us, some are without.

15:15.526 --> 15:21.000
So it's a - looks to be very difficult
task, but it's not.

15:23.574 --> 15:28.683
Because one condition if you can
understand,

15:30.098 --> 15:33.489
is that you have to recognize Me.

15:33.698 --> 15:38.907
I know I am Mahamaya, I'm really very
clever at it.

15:44.701 --> 15:50.984
But I am truthful, I do not have crocodile
tears, I cannot have.

15:51.351 --> 15:56.964
I am truthful, but still I am Mahamaya.

15:57.165 --> 16:02.459
So to recognize Me what should we do?

16:03.358 --> 16:07.899
If we recognize then you are protected.

16:10.686 --> 16:18.022
And the cleansing is the simplest thing
in Sahaja Yoga is to be collective.

16:18.223 --> 16:24.386
If you are not collective then know that
something wrong with you.

16:24.713 --> 16:30.828
If you are collective then as if you are
taking your bath in the river Ganges.

16:31.029 --> 16:34.850
You don't have to go to Himalayas, you
don't have to do individual sadhana much,

16:35.051 --> 16:38.165
you don't have to... just be collective.
If you are collective,

16:38.366 --> 16:44.573
if you are enjoying the collective, then
you should know that you are clean.

16:44.774 --> 16:50.658
No blemishes there, you are absolutely
all right.

16:52.715 --> 16:57.697
Now the second part of is - this Mahamaya
business.

16:57.897 --> 17:02.393
I had to be very close to you, I had to be
extremely close,

17:02.594 --> 17:06.852
talk to you, to have a rapport, to tell you
everything about Yoga

17:07.053 --> 17:12.872
to make you absolutely aware of yourself.
This had to be done,

17:13.073 --> 17:16.686
and with all these complications within
your mind,

17:16.895 --> 17:22.350
within your heart, within your body, I had
to work it out.

17:22.551 --> 17:29.922
To come close in the real form would have
been very dangerous,

17:30.123 --> 17:36.095
so One had to be a Mahamaya. But
despite that,

17:38.819 --> 17:45.824
if you could recognize Me,
to understand Me,

17:46.025 --> 17:52.293
that I am Divine personality,
it's an Incarnation -

17:53.190 --> 17:58.919
that's all the Deities want. Then they'll
look after you in every way.

17:59.120 --> 18:04.204
They'll give you all the powers, they'll
give you all the satisfaction,

18:04.405 --> 18:10.265
all the protection that you want. This is
the condition

18:11.164 --> 18:14.878
which for a rational mind is very difficult
to understand,

18:15.079 --> 18:20.931
that how can Adi Shakti be in one body?

18:21.965 --> 18:26.346
How can the Infinite can become finite?

18:27.570 --> 18:31.468
But human beings cannot do that.

18:32.152 --> 18:38.191
Only human beings. God can do it. He is God
after all.

18:39.415 --> 18:45.617
And if so, you have so many miracles,
you have so many photographs,

18:45.818 --> 18:51.585
so many things to see, but this is what
one has to recognize.

18:52.198 --> 18:56.946
Now I see people, when I talk to them

18:57.147 --> 19:02.142
they start talking to Me a little
frivolously,

19:02.343 --> 19:08.791
not with that depth, not with that feeling
that I am Mahamaya.

19:08.999 --> 19:13.774
Then some of them even answer Me. Some
of them, if I tell them something,

19:13.975 --> 19:20.093
they are ready to give an answer,
explanation.

19:20.294 --> 19:25.051
Of course this freedom I have given you
deliberately,

19:26.116 --> 19:33.806
but must understand that you have
to talk to Me

19:34.007 --> 19:40.670
in a way that is, you would talk
to Adi Shakti.

19:41.244 --> 19:43.745
Very important.

19:49.128 --> 19:56.029
Then how you behave is very important.
You should not be artificial,

19:56.230 --> 20:02.362
you should not be superficial, but best is
to put your hand on your heart,

20:02.563 --> 20:08.132
both the hands, and just try to feel it.

20:09.071 --> 20:12.542
Your Mother is Adi Shakti.

20:13.012 --> 20:19.501
She has created all this Universe, She
has created all this world,

20:20.217 --> 20:27.965
She is for your protection. Even
Shri Krishna could not protect

20:28.841 --> 20:34.236
Pandavas - they had to go in the forest,
they had to suffer.

20:34.437 --> 20:37.977
But not Sahaja Yogis.

20:38.916 --> 20:45.367
As soon as I come to know about your
problems, My attention can work out.

20:45.568 --> 20:49.690
Shri Rama Himself had to go to jungles.

20:49.891 --> 20:58.171
All this is given to you, this protection,
because you are seekers of truth,

20:58.372 --> 21:06.636
and the truth is that I am the Adi Shakti
incarnated.

21:13.630 --> 21:18.768
Once this truth becomes one with yourself

21:19.310 --> 21:24.800
there is nothing to fear, because
all the Deities know this fact,

21:25.008 --> 21:29.913
they know about this Incarnation very well.
They are all prepared for it,

21:30.114 --> 21:39.035
and they'll do anything to substantiate
your belief.

21:39.775 --> 21:45.061
In every way they are trying to give you
My photographs, in the sky, this, that,

21:45.262 --> 21:49.906
I mean all sorts of things. God knows what
they are going to do today.

21:50.368 --> 21:53.319
They are so anxious.

21:53.613 --> 21:57.864
They are behind the stage, before
the stage, all sides of the stage,

21:58.065 --> 22:03.694
listening to Me, feeling happy that I am
telling you the truth.

22:03.895 --> 22:11.115
But the way they recognize and the way
they act, they never disobey.

22:14.680 --> 22:18.090
If you behave in the same manner

22:18.291 --> 22:23.934
you are completely protected from all these
problems I have told you about.

22:25.595 --> 22:31.911
Now I won't say you shouldn't hate anyone,
you shouldn't do.., nothing of the kind.

22:35.294 --> 22:39.340
I wouldn't say you should not steal
something.

22:39.541 --> 22:45.948
I wouldn't say that you make money, don't
make money out of Sahaja Yoga, nothing.

22:46.149 --> 22:50.159
I don't even say don't drink, don't smoke,
I never said so.

22:50.360 --> 22:55.229
But automatically once you know whom
you are facing,

22:55.430 --> 22:59.630
in whose protection you are, automatically
you will do that.

22:59.831 --> 23:02.745
Automatically. You will have no fear.

23:02.946 --> 23:07.686
Once you have recognized you will have
no fear from anyone.

23:07.887 --> 23:15.495
And the more you show that recognition,
the more you realize it,

23:15.696 --> 23:21.692
you get higher and higher. Not only
spiritually,

23:21.893 --> 23:28.065
but every way - mentally, socially,
economically, politically.

23:30.884 --> 23:34.262
It's very remarkable

23:35.795 --> 23:42.039
that not only that you recognize Me
as a Mother who loves you very much,

23:42.240 --> 23:49.896
but a Mother who is powerful to protect
you, She’s very powerful.

23:53.191 --> 23:57.632
If you realize that, and if you feel that
within your heart,

23:57.833 --> 24:03.002
supposing I correct you sometime, instead
of feeling sad you should see it

24:03.203 --> 24:07.467
that "How fortunate I am that Adi Shakti
Herself is correcting me.

24:07.668 --> 24:10.972
She is taking interest in me.

24:11.173 --> 24:15.777
How fortunate I am to be born at this time,

24:15.978 --> 24:22.237
to be with Her in Her great work, what
have I done?"

24:24.977 --> 24:33.165
This recognition itself will fulfil all
the incarnations of Navaratri.

24:33.366 --> 24:39.169
So today we are worshipping the Durga,
Kali,

24:39.370 --> 24:43.893
all these great Goddesses, these Powers,
even Radha.

24:44.094 --> 24:47.266
It was Radha who killed Kamsa not
Shri Krishna.

24:47.482 --> 24:54.129
He had to ask Radha to come and kill him.
It's the Power that kills.

25:00.867 --> 25:05.360
So if you realize

25:06.180 --> 25:12.574
that your Mother is the Adi Shakti.

25:12.775 --> 25:16.019
I know of so many people.

25:16.655 --> 25:21.365
There's one gentleman who is working
in London airport.

25:21.732 --> 25:24.227
Somebody tried to trouble him. He said:
"You see, be careful of?ah...

25:24.428 --> 25:27.786
my Mother is very powerful, you don't
know."

25:27.955 --> 25:33.125
Next day that man lost his job, lost
his business, lost this, lost this,

25:33.326 --> 25:38.495
and he came to him and said: "Now which
is your Mother, let me see Her?"

25:43.614 --> 25:50.152
There was a farmer in, near Rahuri,

25:50.353 --> 25:57.245
and in the night three men came to steal
some sugar cane.

25:58.692 --> 26:05.864
And next day they came and they said:
"Which Goddess do you worship?"

26:06.065 --> 26:15.134
He said: "Why?". "There were three hefty
people watching your - guarding your field,

26:15.342 --> 26:18.600
and we came just to... and we thought,
better take some of this sugar cane,

26:18.801 --> 26:26.127
after all, it looks so nice, and they beat
us. Of course we never got hurt."

26:29.464 --> 26:34.527
So just behind this recognition is
all the powers.

26:34.728 --> 26:38.842
There's so many, so many stories I can
tell you,

26:39.043 --> 26:43.068
how things have happened, how it has
worked out.

26:45.935 --> 26:53.264
But if you are doubting, still halfway,
this, that, then things won't be all right.

26:55.123 --> 26:58.369
You shouldn't worry about your reputation.

26:58.570 --> 27:05.821
Just go with full speed into any direction,
knowing one thing -

27:06.022 --> 27:14.732
that you are My child, and that I am
Adi Shakti.

27:16.130 --> 27:19.082
Everything that looks horrible will become
better.

27:19.283 --> 27:24.626
We have seen it now in this France case,
and all that, what has happened.

27:24.827 --> 27:29.808
Don't worry about anything, just know that

27:31.777 --> 27:34.584
I am the Adi Shakti.

27:34.785 --> 27:41.852
That all the powers of Gods and Goddesses
and all that are within Me,

27:42.053 --> 27:46.253
and they are within Me, and they are all
looking after you.

27:46.454 --> 27:52.089
But if that recognition is not there, they
are not going to recognize you either.

27:58.511 --> 28:03.839
So for today's Navaratri I have to tell you
that just try to keep in mind

28:04.040 --> 28:09.702
that today you are worshipping
the Adi Shakti and not only Durga.

28:11.459 --> 28:15.858
And you are worshipping Durga and all
these Goddesses to thank them.

28:16.059 --> 28:19.905
Because if they had not saved you that time
you would have been so frightened,

28:20.125 --> 28:23.882
you would have become bad people and
you would not have been here.

28:24.083 --> 28:28.061
That is why we are thankful to them
for saving us

28:28.309 --> 28:34.827
and giving us this protection at that time
when we were very helpless.

28:39.996 --> 28:42.866
May God bless you all.

29:01.931 --> 29:05.314
Today’s Puja is very simple.

29:06.759 --> 29:10.320
We’ll just have feet to be washed,

29:10.521 --> 29:15.598
just with one Ganesha’s Atharva Sheersha.

29:15.799 --> 29:19.984
Anyone can wash it. I think the leaders
need not come -

29:20.185 --> 29:25.740
only from UK.

29:25.962 --> 29:31.622
Because today the Puja is done
by the UK people.

29:33.366 --> 29:41.286
And so I would request two or three people
from UK to come and just wash My feet.
