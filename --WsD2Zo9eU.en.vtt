00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:51.609
I bow to all the seekers of Truth

00:01:07.132 --> 00:01:21.117
Yesterday, you have been explained about the
subtle being within us, a subtle instrument

00:01:21.137 --> 00:01:33.382
within us, described in the Bible as Tree
of Life, working out this last breakthrough

00:01:33.382 --> 00:01:39.232
of Self-realization.

00:01:39.682 --> 00:01:52.412
And this happening is a living happening,
a spontaneous happening, the way a seed sprouts

00:01:52.412 --> 00:02:02.293
spontaneously when it is embedded in the Mother
Earth.

00:02:02.293 --> 00:02:17.572
The problem with the human mind is such that
he thinks or it thinks that it can work out

00:02:17.572 --> 00:02:30.372
its own realization, its own emancipation.

00:02:30.372 --> 00:02:40.503
We do not understand a simple thing that at
the human level, we do not do anything that

00:02:40.503 --> 00:02:43.153
is living.

00:02:43.153 --> 00:02:52.143
We cannot germinate a seed even on that.

00:02:52.143 --> 00:02:58.473
We cannot even create anything that is dead.

00:02:58.473 --> 00:03:06.533
We can just transform one dead into another
form.

00:03:06.533 --> 00:03:19.652
But we cannot understand that whatever we
may try, we cannot lay our hands on the living

00:03:19.652 --> 00:03:24.313
process.

00:03:24.313 --> 00:03:29.663
Only after Self-realization you are entitled.

00:03:29.663 --> 00:03:35.003
You get powers to do living work.

00:03:35.003 --> 00:03:46.232
That is the sign of a person who is born again,
who is a yogi, who has had a union with the

00:03:46.232 --> 00:03:47.232
Divine.

00:03:47.232 --> 00:03:58.792
It is not those who proclaim or announce or
advertise that we are something special selected

00:03:58.792 --> 00:04:10.682
people that we have the powers or that we
can take you to Divine.

00:04:10.682 --> 00:04:14.852
One can really produce results.

00:04:14.852 --> 00:04:27.253
Results can only be produced of living process
when you have the power of your spirit.

00:04:27.253 --> 00:04:40.093
We have heard about Christ who cured people
and He cured at that time -- in such a short

00:04:40.093 --> 00:04:48.293
time as it was hardly about twenty-one people
â€' and He was crucified.

00:04:48.293 --> 00:04:54.213
We could not bear the truth that He was the
Son of God.

00:04:54.213 --> 00:05:02.193
Now, maybe one may create big huge organizations
in His name, make big money in His name and

00:05:02.193 --> 00:05:09.733
do all kinds of things, but when He was there,
He was present, they denied Him.

00:05:09.733 --> 00:05:25.443
So as we see within ourself there is this
power which has to manifest, we should be

00:05:25.443 --> 00:05:29.863
very anxious to get our Self-realization.

00:05:29.863 --> 00:05:36.923
If I say there is a diamond available here
-- just free, it's your own â€' people

00:05:36.923 --> 00:05:42.753
would come not only from San Diego but also
from Australia, India, Japan and all over

00:05:42.753 --> 00:05:46.223
the world asking for it.

00:05:46.223 --> 00:05:52.913
But when I say, "There is this diamond within
you in your heart," still we are identifying

00:05:52.913 --> 00:06:02.613
with so many falsehoods that we do not want
that diamond to shine in our attention.

00:06:02.613 --> 00:06:06.473
It is a surprise.

00:06:06.473 --> 00:06:15.143
But I am not surprised because we are still
ignorant.

00:06:15.143 --> 00:06:23.293
We do not know how beautifully we are made,
how in our evolutionary process we are built

00:06:23.293 --> 00:06:29.463
in so beautifully -- the whole information
about the truth.

00:06:29.463 --> 00:06:31.713
Only this machinery has to work out.

00:06:31.713 --> 00:06:38.543
Only this has to get connected with the Divine.

00:06:38.543 --> 00:06:53.603
If we really logically, intelligently understand
that the living process has to work spontaneously

00:06:53.603 --> 00:07:03.023
and you can't do anything about it, you can
understand how Sahaja Yoga works.

00:07:03.023 --> 00:07:05.403
It's all there.

00:07:05.403 --> 00:07:06.943
One does not have to do anything.

00:07:06.943 --> 00:07:11.303
It's all there, like a little seed.

00:07:11.303 --> 00:07:17.263
A minutest one maybe has all the maps of all
the trees you'll be able to produce.

00:07:17.263 --> 00:07:26.433
In the same way, within you lies this potential
which is to be manifested.

00:07:26.433 --> 00:07:37.173
We have been also told about the left and
right side within us.

00:07:37.173 --> 00:07:44.203
Left and right side are the only two sides
to which our attention can go, which represents

00:07:44.203 --> 00:07:47.043
our sympathetic nervous system.

00:07:47.043 --> 00:07:50.243
That is when you go into any emergency.

00:07:50.243 --> 00:07:57.363
Suppose you are rushing somewhere or running,
your sympathetic goes into action and creates

00:07:57.363 --> 00:08:03.603
the results necessary for that action.

00:08:03.603 --> 00:08:11.293
For example, you have to run; so the sympathetic
will start pumping the blood fast, will start

00:08:11.293 --> 00:08:16.273
breathing fast.

00:08:16.273 --> 00:08:23.953
But what brings it back to normal is the central
path, what we call represented in the medical

00:08:23.953 --> 00:08:28.733
terminology as parasympathetic nervous system.

00:08:28.733 --> 00:08:34.613
So in our own effort we can only go to the
left or right.

00:08:34.613 --> 00:08:42.693
But when we try to go too much to the left
or right, we create problems, which we cannot

00:08:42.693 --> 00:08:46.833
explain and we cannot understand.

00:08:46.833 --> 00:08:51.442
The first and foremost problem we create is
the physical problem.

00:08:51.442 --> 00:08:53.232
Today there are so many diseases.

00:08:53.232 --> 00:09:05.243
We cannot understand how these diseases came
into being and what is the nature of its creation

00:09:05.243 --> 00:09:10.703
or how are we going to get rid of this.

00:09:10.703 --> 00:09:17.823
Everybody is afraid of that unknown disease
and these unknown diseases can fall up to

00:09:17.823 --> 00:09:26.793
anyone, whatever you may say, unless and until
you become a spirit.

00:09:26.793 --> 00:09:31.823
How they are caused is a very simple thing
to understand.

00:09:31.823 --> 00:09:37.483
The physical problems come to us because of
our imbalances.

00:09:37.483 --> 00:09:44.043
In various ways we try to go to the left or
to the right.

00:09:44.043 --> 00:09:51.343
Now, let us see how cancer is caused because
that is the headache of today, or maybe of

00:09:51.343 --> 00:09:57.293
yesterday -- today's headache is something
else.

00:09:57.293 --> 00:10:09.023
Cancer is caused only because we do not keep
to our temperament right.

00:10:09.023 --> 00:10:20.603
If I say that this is the center that is formed
by the left and the right side, then this

00:10:20.603 --> 00:10:29.893
center is providing the necessary vital energy
to the left and right side equally.

00:10:29.893 --> 00:10:39.403
But supposing you are a very futuristic person,
you are planning too much, thinking too much,

00:10:39.403 --> 00:10:40.613
then what do you do?

00:10:40.613 --> 00:10:42.953
You use your right side too much.

00:10:42.953 --> 00:10:49.033
As a result this moves this way.

00:10:49.033 --> 00:10:55.083
Also, the center now constricts.

00:10:55.083 --> 00:11:02.763
There is no space in between left in the center
for the vital energy to flow.

00:11:02.763 --> 00:11:11.593
At this juncture when you have moved too much
from the left side, if any emotional disturbance

00:11:11.593 --> 00:11:21.653
comes in or if you go to somebody who is practicing
black magic and all kinds of left-sided negative

00:11:21.653 --> 00:11:32.193
things, or else you might get weak with an
accident or a shock, this breaks, and when

00:11:32.193 --> 00:11:42.863
this center breaks, you lose your connection
with the center.

00:11:42.863 --> 00:11:49.803
The controlling agency that is the central
nervous system does not play any more part.

00:11:49.803 --> 00:11:59.843
What happens to you is that the growth of
the cells become malignant -- means they grow

00:11:59.843 --> 00:12:02.433
on their own.

00:12:02.433 --> 00:12:05.365
There is no relationship to the growth of
other cells.

00:12:05.365 --> 00:12:13.023
For example, suddenly you'll find such a person
will have a nose increasing in size or you'll

00:12:13.023 --> 00:12:19.163
find an ear increasing in size overpowering
all others or we can say that it becomes a

00:12:19.163 --> 00:12:21.393
very dominating cell.

00:12:21.393 --> 00:12:26.503
This is a simple thing that happens in cancer.

00:12:26.503 --> 00:12:35.983
Luckily, we have now in Delhi University the
understanding of Sahaja Yoga very well because

00:12:35.983 --> 00:12:44.423
we have cured many people of very -- somehow
they were very highly placed in life of cancer

00:12:44.423 --> 00:12:45.803
and other diseases.

00:12:45.803 --> 00:12:54.823
So they have accepted it for a doctorate,
and two doctors have got now their MD in two

00:12:54.823 --> 00:12:57.493
subjects -- one was a psychosomatic disease.

00:12:57.493 --> 00:13:02.093
One of the psychosomatic disease is cancer.

00:13:02.093 --> 00:13:10.733
There are so many others -- and another one
who has got his doctorate is in the physical

00:13:10.733 --> 00:13:17.862
fitness and vulnerability.

00:13:17.862 --> 00:13:23.003
Now there are seven other doctors in London
who are doing research on it (AIDS?) ....and

00:13:23.003 --> 00:13:30.523
its remarkable how after realization you get
out of the clutches of physical sickness.

00:13:30.523 --> 00:13:40.753
So what happens when the kundalini rises,
what she does, she pierces through this constricted

00:13:40.753 --> 00:13:48.773
chakras, repairs it and brings it back to
its normal position, repairs it.

00:13:48.773 --> 00:13:57.793
And I have seen our President of India getting
cured of his cancer in ten minutes time, that

00:13:57.793 --> 00:14:02.773
too on the aeroplane.

00:14:02.773 --> 00:14:11.853
But it's easy to deal with an Indian because
they know what is a kundalini and they know

00:14:11.853 --> 00:14:13.113
what is a saint.

00:14:13.113 --> 00:14:19.423
They will not easily take to these fake persons.

00:14:19.423 --> 00:14:32.643
Though you are great seekers of a very high
quality, that understanding is there in India

00:14:32.643 --> 00:14:36.763
more because they know more about the roots
and not about the tree, as you know more about

00:14:36.763 --> 00:14:39.373
the tree.

00:14:39.373 --> 00:14:49.163
But it's such a barrier in understanding that
three hundred years English ruled in India,

00:14:49.163 --> 00:14:51.693
they could not learn a word.

00:14:51.693 --> 00:15:02.103
Today, it's amazing to see such a difficult
Sanskrit verses about the Primordial Mother

00:15:02.103 --> 00:15:11.723
written by Adi Shankaracharya in the sixth
century, which many Indians will find it difficult

00:15:11.723 --> 00:15:17.653
to sing, it's so beautifully sung.

00:15:17.653 --> 00:15:25.973
The whole mantras, as they say, are beautifully
rendered that even a well-equipped Brahmin

00:15:25.973 --> 00:15:30.463
cannot do, by people who are not from India.

00:15:30.463 --> 00:15:34.763
They don't even know Sanskrit language.

00:15:34.763 --> 00:15:41.083
How this has happened is the manifestation
of the spirit.

00:15:41.083 --> 00:15:48.083
The manifestation of the spirit gives you
a dynamic personality.

00:15:48.083 --> 00:15:52.093
This dynamism comes to you.

00:15:52.093 --> 00:15:57.413
You can sing whatever you like, you can draw
whatever you like, you can paint whatever

00:15:57.413 --> 00:15:58.893
you like.

00:15:58.893 --> 00:16:06.163
There are so many people who have become great
orators and musicians, especially in India,

00:16:06.163 --> 00:16:09.773
because my work mostly has been in India.

00:16:09.773 --> 00:16:16.373
Of course, not that I am not concerned about
the West.

00:16:16.373 --> 00:16:21.672
I have been, as I told you, many a times in
America.

00:16:21.672 --> 00:16:32.563
But to understand the reality, the first thing
we must know that money has nothing to do

00:16:32.563 --> 00:16:34.093
with the living process.

00:16:34.093 --> 00:16:46.063
In America, you'll be surprised, there has
been a business offered to me that the cool

00:16:46.063 --> 00:16:57.043
breeze that I blow, if I can bottle it up,
they can sell it.

00:16:57.043 --> 00:17:05.613
Everything goes into a business proposition,
and that's why it is so difficult.

00:17:05.613 --> 00:17:15.473
For example, you have seen near -- of course,
I must say you are great people that you have

00:17:15.473 --> 00:17:25.143
come to a program which has nothing to do
with money -- it is something really remarkable,

00:17:25.143 --> 00:17:28.263
I must say.

00:17:28.263 --> 00:17:35.023
But today if I was talking in India or if
I was visiting even a small village, there

00:17:35.023 --> 00:17:45.123
would have been minimum ten thousand people
-- minimum â€' and they would get all their

00:17:45.123 --> 00:17:47.773
realization.

00:17:47.773 --> 00:18:00.113
The seeking is in the West, they are honest
seekers, but what to seek is the knowledge

00:18:00.113 --> 00:18:01.983
which is in the East.

00:18:01.983 --> 00:18:09.223
It's something like somebody have the teeth
but no food, and those have food have no teeth

00:18:09.223 --> 00:18:18.013
on one side and on the other side they have
teeth but no food.

00:18:18.013 --> 00:18:27.192
It is such a simple thing to get rid of your
physical problems â€' is the easiest â€'

00:18:27.192 --> 00:18:36.272
and the second comes is the problem, as they
say, is of stress, which is a common disease

00:18:36.272 --> 00:18:38.902
in the West, is stress.

00:18:38.902 --> 00:18:44.302
What is the source of stress within us?

00:18:44.302 --> 00:18:51.942
The source of stress is very simple that when
we think -- I mean, these days the amount

00:18:51.942 --> 00:19:03.343
of thinking we do -- first of all when I came
to America, I was very confused because of

00:19:03.343 --> 00:19:06.802
the choices you had.

00:19:06.802 --> 00:19:13.182
You walk into any bathroom -- you better ask
the owner how do you operate, otherwise suddenly

00:19:13.182 --> 00:19:19.642
you'll find you have fallen into a big swimming
pool; suddenly it opens out for you.

00:19:19.642 --> 00:19:31.662
Or maybe you open some sort of a shower and
it becomes a torrential rain -- so many choices

00:19:31.662 --> 00:19:35.452
which maddens you completely.

00:19:35.452 --> 00:19:40.613
What is there to choose about how you'll have
your scissors?

00:19:40.613 --> 00:19:46.202
As long as the scissor work, it should be
all right.

00:19:46.202 --> 00:19:51.733
It is so complicated because so much of machinery
-- they have to produce so many things, so

00:19:51.733 --> 00:19:54.932
many varieties!

00:19:54.932 --> 00:20:02.272
Right from A to Z, whether it is a dress,
whether it is a hair-do, whether it is a carpet,

00:20:02.272 --> 00:20:10.542
or it is an ordinary thing which we call as
the handle of the car.

00:20:10.542 --> 00:20:16.012
Before getting into the car better ask the
driver how it operates otherwise you'll be

00:20:16.012 --> 00:20:17.312
lumped?[locked].

00:20:17.312 --> 00:20:26.402
There is no uniformity kept about these useless
material things and so the choices are so

00:20:26.402 --> 00:20:27.402
many.

00:20:27.402 --> 00:20:32.483
You go to a shop, you go mad -- you don't
know what to buy.

00:20:32.483 --> 00:20:39.923
You just ask them, "I just need a, some, say,
powder for my body."

00:20:39.923 --> 00:20:42.103
"Now, which one you want?

00:20:42.103 --> 00:20:43.103
This one?

00:20:43.103 --> 00:20:44.103
This one?"

00:20:44.103 --> 00:20:45.273
They'll give you thirty-two things.

00:20:45.273 --> 00:20:46.912
You start wondering, "Oh, God!

00:20:46.912 --> 00:20:50.332
I have only one body and thirty-two things."

00:20:50.332 --> 00:20:59.243
It is so difficult to locate something that
you need because you really don't know -- this

00:20:59.243 --> 00:21:03.843
is natural, number one; this is absurd, number
two -- like that goes on and on and on, the

00:21:03.843 --> 00:21:08.473
list for a small nonsensical thing like that.

00:21:08.473 --> 00:21:12.223
Then tomorrow you go in the market, you find
that's gone out of market.

00:21:12.223 --> 00:21:17.613
Now another thirty-two things have come!

00:21:17.613 --> 00:21:27.582
All such maddening things put you to thinking,
"What should I do?"

00:21:27.582 --> 00:21:32.873
Then we have to plan out everything in the
future.

00:21:32.873 --> 00:21:40.442
It is so much so that by temperament, people
have become futuristic.

00:21:40.442 --> 00:21:46.142
Like they are sitting here listening to Me,
but they are thinking, "Now, how will I go

00:21:46.142 --> 00:21:47.142
home?

00:21:47.142 --> 00:21:49.572
And what food I will be eating?

00:21:49.572 --> 00:21:51.822
Then what music I will have?"

00:21:51.822 --> 00:22:00.632
They are sitting here at present but thinking
about something ....They are too much planning.

00:22:00.632 --> 00:22:03.272
They do not know the plan of the Divine.

00:22:03.272 --> 00:22:08.863
They'll plan it out: rush, go forward, do
this, go to the airport.

00:22:08.863 --> 00:22:09.873
What has happened?

00:22:09.873 --> 00:22:13.883
The plane is delayed three hours!

00:22:13.883 --> 00:22:14.883
Why?

00:22:14.883 --> 00:22:18.623
Because their condition, holiday cancelled.

00:22:18.623 --> 00:22:22.452
They had planned the holiday a year ahead.

00:22:22.452 --> 00:22:28.182
Poor things, you see, packed everything to
go somewhere.

00:22:28.182 --> 00:22:32.493
Holiday had to be cancelled because the planes
are not moving.

00:22:32.493 --> 00:22:34.932
So they sit down on the airport.

00:22:34.932 --> 00:22:37.912
See, they're waiting for something to happen.

00:22:37.912 --> 00:22:43.892
Nothing happens; they go off.

00:22:43.892 --> 00:22:49.623
But a yogi does not plan.

00:22:49.623 --> 00:22:53.572
He knows what's going to happen.

00:22:53.572 --> 00:22:55.802
He does not bother.

00:22:55.802 --> 00:23:01.403
But supposing a yogi gets lost on the way.

00:23:01.403 --> 00:23:07.662
Then he thinks, "All right, if I am lost there
must be something here.

00:23:07.662 --> 00:23:09.282
I must see it.

00:23:09.282 --> 00:23:10.503
I am there with myself.

00:23:10.503 --> 00:23:11.932
I am not lost.

00:23:11.932 --> 00:23:14.412
So let's enjoy."

00:23:14.412 --> 00:23:18.143
After all, what are we going to miss?

00:23:18.143 --> 00:23:25.312
It is something one has to see that as we
are so much stressed and under the domination

00:23:25.312 --> 00:23:35.422
of these watches, that we all the time rush,
rush, rush.

00:23:35.422 --> 00:23:40.993
Even the jobs that we do, we are supposed
to rush.

00:23:40.993 --> 00:23:50.432
You will rush as much as you like but the
problem is your mind also rushes with it and

00:23:50.432 --> 00:23:53.353
the whole personality gets involved into it.

00:23:53.353 --> 00:24:02.262
But if you have seen a wheel, the whole wheel
moves but the axis has to be steady.

00:24:02.262 --> 00:24:07.493
If the axis also starts moving, there is stress.

00:24:07.493 --> 00:24:17.632
That's exactly what happens to us that we
start moving with all the tensions that are

00:24:17.632 --> 00:24:21.093
so-called -- I call them [unclear].

00:24:21.093 --> 00:24:25.012
There is a center within us which we call
as Swadhisthana center.

00:24:25.012 --> 00:24:32.463
It's the second center which as you see is
working out the Void.

00:24:32.463 --> 00:24:40.643
We call this as the Void -- not the Zen Void
-- but this is the Void, and this area is

00:24:40.643 --> 00:24:50.202
worked out by the Swadhisthana which looks
after the liver, the pancreas, spleen, the

00:24:50.202 --> 00:24:53.843
kidneys and part of the intestine.

00:24:53.843 --> 00:25:01.072
Intestines, physically or in the medical terminology
we can say, the aortic plexus manifested by

00:25:01.072 --> 00:25:06.493
this center works out.

00:25:06.493 --> 00:25:12.952
Now when the center is doing this work in
balance, it's all right.

00:25:12.952 --> 00:25:23.782
But when we think too much then the same center
has to convert the fat for the use of the

00:25:23.782 --> 00:25:29.532
brain to make it into gray cells.

00:25:29.532 --> 00:25:39.473
But when we think too much then it neglects
other important works which it has to do.

00:25:39.473 --> 00:25:42.162
So you get a liver trouble.

00:25:42.162 --> 00:25:51.292
I find at least fifty percent people in the
West are suffering from liver trouble.

00:25:51.292 --> 00:25:57.822
They are not aware of it till they get to
cirrhosis, to skin troubles, this, that.

00:25:57.822 --> 00:26:06.802
They will not know that they have a bad liver,
till they have jaundice or other diseases

00:26:06.802 --> 00:26:13.692
which are caused by liver problems.

00:26:13.692 --> 00:26:18.412
Then we have people who have lethargic livers
also.

00:26:18.412 --> 00:26:24.593
So we have two types of people who have lethargic
organs or overactive organs.

00:26:24.593 --> 00:26:35.952
So this Swadhisthana Chakra cannot look after
its duty in a balanced way, creates a kind

00:26:35.952 --> 00:26:39.172
of an imbalance.

00:26:39.172 --> 00:26:46.373
So you neglect your pancreas, you get diabetes.

00:26:46.373 --> 00:26:54.012
It's a funny idea that is now prevalent that
we should not take sugar because â€' I

00:26:54.012 --> 00:26:59.502
don't know from where it has come -- because
they think it causes you diabetes!

00:26:59.502 --> 00:27:02.743
It does not.

00:27:02.743 --> 00:27:14.843
In India, in a village if you go, they have
to put so much sugar in the tea that the spoon

00:27:14.843 --> 00:27:21.873
must stand at right angles â€' otherwise
they won't take â€' and nobody has diabetes.

00:27:21.873 --> 00:27:24.273
They have never heard about it, never.

00:27:24.273 --> 00:27:25.273
No.

00:27:25.273 --> 00:27:26.912
"What is diabetes?

00:27:26.912 --> 00:27:28.782
What is that?"

00:27:28.782 --> 00:27:30.552
they'll say.

00:27:30.552 --> 00:27:37.272
The reason is they don't think.

00:27:37.272 --> 00:27:38.272
They live for the moment.

00:27:38.272 --> 00:27:41.022
All right, today is the work.

00:27:41.022 --> 00:27:48.123
Let's do this farming and come home and sleep
off.

00:27:48.123 --> 00:27:50.483
They don't think too much.

00:27:50.483 --> 00:27:53.983
We think about everything, plan out everything.

00:27:53.983 --> 00:28:01.853
Whatever is spontaneous also we think about
it!

00:28:01.853 --> 00:28:06.792
Then the third thing that happens to you is
the trouble of the spleen.

00:28:06.792 --> 00:28:08.642
Now spleen is our time-keeper.

00:28:08.642 --> 00:28:11.812
It gives us a rhythm.

00:28:11.812 --> 00:28:17.093
As you have seen the rhythm today, in the
same way it's the rhythm of the life is kept

00:28:17.093 --> 00:28:19.493
by the spleen.

00:28:19.493 --> 00:28:26.872
When you go into an emergency, then the same
spleen starts producing more red blood corpuscles

00:28:26.872 --> 00:28:28.643
for your use.

00:28:28.643 --> 00:28:35.812
Now today's life, as it is, is all the time
shocking.

00:28:35.812 --> 00:28:41.632
Early in the morning you read your newspaper.

00:28:41.632 --> 00:28:48.503
I think this is one of the worst habits, because
as soon as you see the newspaper, the first

00:28:48.503 --> 00:28:49.812
shock in the morning.

00:28:49.812 --> 00:28:51.012
Oh, God!

00:28:51.012 --> 00:28:52.372
So many dead.

00:28:52.372 --> 00:28:54.983
Plane was crashed.

00:28:54.983 --> 00:28:57.633
War has started.

00:28:57.633 --> 00:28:59.932
Somebody fell from somewhere.

00:28:59.932 --> 00:29:05.483
All horrible things in the newspaper because
newspapers don't believe in giving something

00:29:05.483 --> 00:29:07.452
good news!

00:29:07.452 --> 00:29:14.702
If there will be peace and happiness what
will they publish, I don't know.

00:29:14.702 --> 00:29:19.733
So they want to give shocking news so there
is some sensation in the body.

00:29:19.733 --> 00:29:26.122
It has happened to such an extent that now
unless and until the music is sensational,

00:29:26.122 --> 00:29:32.682
unless and until we get a shock all the time,
we do not react.

00:29:32.682 --> 00:29:37.022
Of course, the joy part is missing -- no doubt
about it.

00:29:37.022 --> 00:29:45.353
So this poor spleen doesn't understand -- this
personality which is all the time under shock.

00:29:45.353 --> 00:29:51.392
Then you get into our car and on the road
there is a jam.

00:29:51.392 --> 00:29:52.392
Finish!

00:29:52.392 --> 00:29:56.772
You had to reach at such and such time; now
it's a jam.

00:29:56.772 --> 00:30:03.682
Now you are cursing everything, sitting down
there worrying.

00:30:03.682 --> 00:30:05.552
Suddenly you find an accident.

00:30:05.552 --> 00:30:09.713
Then you go in the office or some place where
you are working.

00:30:09.713 --> 00:30:15.082
The boss has had a quarrel with his wife;
so he comes and shouts at you -- another shock.

00:30:15.082 --> 00:30:21.503
All the time you are facing very arrogant,
horrible people.

00:30:21.503 --> 00:30:27.272
I mean, I myself am afraid to go to shops
or anything because suddenly they jump on

00:30:27.272 --> 00:30:32.993
you like a horse or sometimes like a dog.

00:30:32.993 --> 00:30:35.622
God knows how they will react on you.

00:30:35.622 --> 00:30:37.442
You get a fright.

00:30:37.442 --> 00:30:38.993
What's the matter with them?

00:30:38.993 --> 00:30:41.363
Why are they so shocking?

00:30:41.363 --> 00:30:47.402
But all of them are under stress and they
are taking it out on you.

00:30:47.402 --> 00:30:57.863
But the worst thing that happens with this
spleen going crazy is that you get blood cancer.

00:30:57.863 --> 00:31:09.392
Blood cancer is caused by hectic life and
for speedy life that we lead.

00:31:09.392 --> 00:31:13.282
Now the blood pressure comes from the kidney.

00:31:13.282 --> 00:31:18.613
And like that so many things are caused by
one simple thing â€' that we think too

00:31:18.613 --> 00:31:21.163
much.

00:31:21.163 --> 00:31:23.973
What is there to think?

00:31:23.973 --> 00:31:26.843
I just don't understand.

00:31:26.843 --> 00:31:29.622
Whatever has to happen, will happen.

00:31:29.622 --> 00:31:33.113
By thinking, nothing is going to stop.

00:31:33.113 --> 00:31:37.213
By thinking we have achieved nothing.

00:31:37.213 --> 00:31:44.072
If you read Einstein who has developed the
theory of relativity, at the very outset he

00:31:44.072 --> 00:31:52.952
says that, "I was tired and I was lying down
in my garden, playing with soap bubbles and

00:31:52.952 --> 00:32:01.103
suddenly from somewhere unknown the theory
of relativity dawned upon me."

00:32:01.103 --> 00:32:04.263
Whatever we have is there.

00:32:04.263 --> 00:32:12.492
Whatever we have to find out comes from the
unknown, but thinking about it like mad just

00:32:12.492 --> 00:32:13.492
ruins us.

00:32:13.492 --> 00:32:16.013
But if I say, "Don't think," you can't stop
thinking.

00:32:16.013 --> 00:32:21.182
I know that because we had a wonderful doctor
in Switzerland.

00:32:21.182 --> 00:32:23.603
He came and said, "Mother, do what You like.

00:32:23.603 --> 00:32:28.072
You cut my throat, You cut my head but stop
this thinking.

00:32:28.072 --> 00:32:29.632
I am going mad."

00:32:29.632 --> 00:32:35.593
So he developed a momentum of thinking, all
the time thinking, thinking, thinking.

00:32:35.593 --> 00:32:41.093
Now what happens with the kundalini, when
the kundalini rises, passes through your Agnya

00:32:41.093 --> 00:32:48.062
Chakra, you go beyond thinking.

00:32:48.062 --> 00:32:53.182
It is like one wave of thought comes up and
goes down, another wave of thought comes up

00:32:53.182 --> 00:32:55.513
and goes down.

00:32:55.513 --> 00:33:00.353
In the center there is a little space; so
one comes from the past and goes to the future,

00:33:00.353 --> 00:33:02.912
another from the future to the past.

00:33:02.912 --> 00:33:06.713
In between there is a little space, and that
is the present.

00:33:06.713 --> 00:33:12.742
So when the kundalini rises, passes through
this Agnya Chakra â€' the one that gives

00:33:12.742 --> 00:33:19.412
you thought is the ego and the superego on
both the side, as you can see clearly -- they

00:33:19.412 --> 00:33:27.812
are sucked in; your karmas are sucked in,
your ego is sucked in, your conditioning is

00:33:27.812 --> 00:33:33.513
sucked in and you stand at the present moment.

00:33:33.513 --> 00:33:38.282
Then if you want to think, if you don't want
to think, you just sit down in complete silence

00:33:38.282 --> 00:33:40.942
and enjoy yourself.

00:33:40.942 --> 00:33:43.072
You become in command.

00:33:43.072 --> 00:33:48.603
Like you are standing in the water, you are
afraid of getting drowned, but if you get

00:33:48.603 --> 00:33:51.663
into the boat you enjoy the water.

00:33:51.663 --> 00:33:57.952
But supposing you become a master swimmer,
then you can save others also from the water.

00:33:57.952 --> 00:34:05.642
This is exactly what happens when a Sahaja
yogi establishes himself well, that he can

00:34:05.642 --> 00:34:13.752
give salvation to so many and can save so
many people.

00:34:13.752 --> 00:34:16.983
This is how we are going to emancipate.

00:34:16.983 --> 00:34:23.603
Now the emotional side that we have is also
another extreme to which we bow?

00:34:23.603 --> 00:34:30.533
And with the help of certain elements, you
will be surprised: one candle can at least

00:34:30.533 --> 00:34:38.973
cure twenty-five mad people at least.

00:34:38.973 --> 00:34:40.942
It's very simple.

00:34:40.942 --> 00:34:52.402
If you enlighten this light, then what happens
that enlightened light goes inside your left

00:34:52.402 --> 00:35:02.132
side and enlightens it completely and all
the negativity disappears in your collective

00:35:02.132 --> 00:35:03.733
subconscious.

00:35:03.733 --> 00:35:11.672
And you know who all suffer from the left
side of insanity, epilepsy, schizophrenia,

00:35:11.672 --> 00:35:16.223
all this nonsense.

00:35:16.223 --> 00:35:22.903
Because you stand in the center -- you are
neither on the left nor on the right -- if

00:35:22.903 --> 00:35:26.882
you are in the center, you get rid of your
emotional problems.

00:35:26.882 --> 00:35:31.263
Now, there are spiritual problems also.

00:35:31.263 --> 00:35:39.403
Before as we have, I told you, thinking problem,
we have also physical problems like over-exertion.

00:35:39.403 --> 00:35:41.983
Now people are jogging.

00:35:41.983 --> 00:35:46.302
It's madness, I really tell you.

00:35:46.302 --> 00:35:50.862
First, I thought there is some sort of an
earthquake that the old, young, everybody

00:35:50.862 --> 00:35:51.862
running.

00:35:51.862 --> 00:35:52.862
What is happening?

00:35:52.862 --> 00:35:53.862
What's wrong?

00:35:53.862 --> 00:35:56.353
Where are you running?

00:35:56.353 --> 00:35:59.973
Because you are over-exerting yourself.

00:35:59.973 --> 00:36:03.733
What is the need to over-exert yourself?

00:36:03.733 --> 00:36:09.254
Because now a concept is that if you are muscular
-- I don't know whatever is the concept, every

00:36:09.254 --> 00:36:14.923
day changing, every day you find new, new
things -- then you become over-efficient;

00:36:14.923 --> 00:36:15.923
you become tired.

00:36:15.923 --> 00:36:16.923
It's absurd.

00:36:16.923 --> 00:36:23.943
We have seen in history, say, we have got
the greatest statesman and the person who

00:36:23.943 --> 00:36:30.923
saved us from this horrible Hitler was Churchill
and what a fat man he was.

00:36:30.923 --> 00:36:43.443
He never did jogging in his life!

00:36:43.443 --> 00:36:45.793
I mean, you must accept your body.

00:36:45.793 --> 00:36:46.793
It requires rest.

00:36:46.793 --> 00:36:53.153
For example, if I start jogging, I'll be nowhere
Myself because I need a lot of water to protect

00:36:53.153 --> 00:36:56.183
the chakras which work out the emancipation.

00:36:56.183 --> 00:37:05.113
To Me, that is much more important than becoming
some sort of a cinema actress.

00:37:05.113 --> 00:37:06.443
There are many cinema actresses.

00:37:06.443 --> 00:37:07.613
So what?

00:37:07.613 --> 00:37:09.163
What have they achieved?

00:37:09.163 --> 00:37:14.493
How many people have they emancipated?

00:37:14.493 --> 00:37:18.862
So what is your ideal in life is to be decided
first.

00:37:18.862 --> 00:37:23.793
Do you want to be all the time slave of your
body?

00:37:23.793 --> 00:37:25.783
And I don't know what you get.

00:37:25.783 --> 00:37:28.663
I mean, these days nobody looks at no one.

00:37:28.663 --> 00:37:36.552
They are fed up now and you can't make out
one from another because they go to the same

00:37:36.552 --> 00:37:38.003
hairdresser.

00:37:38.003 --> 00:37:39.623
One fashion starts.

00:37:39.623 --> 00:37:44.783
I have to think, "Is this he same person or
somebody else?"

00:37:44.783 --> 00:37:53.793
I mean, it is better to grow your beard to
look something different.

00:37:53.793 --> 00:37:58.082
I mean, there no way of making out who is
who!

00:37:58.082 --> 00:38:03.693
Everybody has the same hair dress, everybody
has the same funny dress, everybody looking

00:38:03.693 --> 00:38:04.693
the same.

00:38:04.693 --> 00:38:07.583
They have no personality.

00:38:07.583 --> 00:38:12.862
Tomorrow a wave comes that you should put
a plastic bag on your head -- everybody will

00:38:12.862 --> 00:38:17.753
be moving with a plastic head.

00:38:17.753 --> 00:38:19.593
We have to have a personality.

00:38:19.593 --> 00:38:24.403
Why should we dress up as everybody is dressing
up?

00:38:24.403 --> 00:38:26.973
Such a pressure.

00:38:26.973 --> 00:38:32.053
I know that because I have another life which
you know very well which is supposed to be

00:38:32.053 --> 00:38:36.443
the high society -- so-called.

00:38:36.443 --> 00:38:41.903
And the stupidest thing we discuss in that
society.

00:38:41.903 --> 00:38:48.803
Like they laugh at a woman if she is wearing
something that was, say, belonging to sixties.

00:38:48.803 --> 00:38:53.003
I mean, what's the harm?

00:38:53.003 --> 00:38:55.892
No, that's not modern!

00:38:55.892 --> 00:38:59.943
But what do you gain by becoming so modern
running with the fashion?

00:38:59.943 --> 00:39:01.713
What do you gain?

00:39:01.713 --> 00:39:07.332
Now the fashion in England is to make holey
pants -- you make holes.

00:39:07.332 --> 00:39:11.132
Imagine that cold, horrible cold that you
have.

00:39:11.132 --> 00:39:17.793
What is the need to make holes in your pant
to get all kinds of troubles?

00:39:17.793 --> 00:39:20.163
And then they'll have arthritis; then they'll
have this.

00:39:20.163 --> 00:39:24.263
First they had tight pants; so they developed
varicose veins.

00:39:24.263 --> 00:39:33.013
Now they are having such loose pants that
they will develop arthritis.

00:39:33.013 --> 00:39:36.283
These people are managing you.

00:39:36.283 --> 00:39:40.203
These manufacturers are befooling you.

00:39:40.203 --> 00:39:46.963
This we cannot see because we have lost our
personality.

00:39:46.963 --> 00:39:53.433
So we develop so many problems also because
we play into the hands of nonsenses.

00:39:53.433 --> 00:40:00.852
Now, say, Indian people have lived for so
many ages now so they have learnt all the

00:40:00.852 --> 00:40:02.062
lessons.

00:40:02.062 --> 00:40:08.223
If you go and tell them that you wear a holey
pant they'll say to/you, "Get lost!

00:40:08.223 --> 00:40:09.363
Sorry, sir.

00:40:09.363 --> 00:40:10.553
We know everything."

00:40:10.553 --> 00:40:18.112
Now they are painting their hair and when
they are painting their hair, people say,

00:40:18.112 --> 00:40:20.562
"Why are you painting their hair?"

00:40:20.562 --> 00:40:23.243
"Oh, that's the fashion.

00:40:23.243 --> 00:40:24.433
What's wrong?"

00:40:24.433 --> 00:40:27.203
But people become blind in that.

00:40:27.203 --> 00:40:33.153
We had three patients who became blind because
they painted their hair and some sort of a

00:40:33.153 --> 00:40:34.653
thing -- punk, punk.

00:40:34.653 --> 00:40:39.663
They were three blind punks who came to Sahaja
Yoga.

00:40:39.663 --> 00:40:47.543
Actually, you have to punch them to talk to
them.

00:40:47.543 --> 00:40:51.463
This is the society in which we live.

00:40:51.463 --> 00:40:55.043
Anybody who is sane will think I am mad.

00:40:55.043 --> 00:41:03.173
Like going to a lunatic asylum, you start
thinking, "Am I mad or they are mad?"

00:41:03.173 --> 00:41:05.423
That's how it creates a stress on us.

00:41:05.423 --> 00:41:11.102
Let us live with our own dignity.

00:41:11.102 --> 00:41:14.892
You can see Mahatma Gandhi went for his round
table conference.

00:41:14.892 --> 00:41:18.082
He wore his dhoti.

00:41:18.082 --> 00:41:25.243
He didn't wear a three-piece suit and a tail
coat -- that's another nonsense!

00:41:25.243 --> 00:41:29.773
Everybody in England has to wear a tailcoat
when they go to the Queen's party.

00:41:29.773 --> 00:41:31.892
But they can't afford.

00:41:31.892 --> 00:41:37.263
So they borrow; some are tight, some are loose.

00:41:37.263 --> 00:41:42.993
And when you see them there -- I mean, I have
been to many of them -- you can't recognize,

00:41:42.993 --> 00:41:52.112
and they look so absurd and clownish that,
poor things, you know all these big, big ambassadors

00:41:52.112 --> 00:41:56.453
have to go about with that because it is supposed
to be a formal dress.

00:41:56.453 --> 00:41:59.913
I mean, what a formal dress it is.

00:41:59.913 --> 00:42:02.622
All these things pressurize you.

00:42:02.622 --> 00:42:07.593
They make you feel, "Oh, you must wear a dress
like this."

00:42:07.593 --> 00:42:14.693
Even when you go to some guru, he says, "All
right, you all have to wear," say, "orange

00:42:14.693 --> 00:42:15.733
dress."

00:42:15.733 --> 00:42:21.543
So you are forced into it; you have to wear
the orange dress.

00:42:21.543 --> 00:42:31.513
From where are you going to manage -- getting
rid of all this nonsense of forcing you to

00:42:31.513 --> 00:42:34.042
do this and forcing you to do that.

00:42:34.042 --> 00:42:43.142
But here you are so individualistic and here
you are a down-to-earth personality,

00:42:43.142 --> 00:42:50.903
Its not that anybody says you have to do it
but you just do it because we have our own

00:42:50.903 --> 00:42:51.903
personality.

00:42:51.903 --> 00:42:55.563
Individualism means personality.

00:42:55.563 --> 00:43:05.003
And that is what when it is lost, you feel
also your guilt and your stress.

00:43:05.003 --> 00:43:13.092
That's possible that you stand on in your
own glory, in your own personality, in your

00:43:13.092 --> 00:43:16.693
own understanding of your spiritual value.

00:43:16.693 --> 00:43:25.213
So when that starts, another style of movement
comes in, like hippies.

00:43:25.213 --> 00:43:39.302
We become like a primitive person, you become
like a hippy, you go about like a hippy, you

00:43:39.302 --> 00:43:48.023
wear a funny dress, become a primitive personality
and think, "Oh, I have done very great thing."

00:43:48.023 --> 00:43:54.093
I had some hippies with Me, I told you yesterday.

00:43:54.093 --> 00:43:59.683
So I asked them, "Why do you dress up like
this?"

00:43:59.683 --> 00:44:02.953
They said, "We want this kind of culture."

00:44:02.953 --> 00:44:04.853
I said, "This is primitive."

00:44:04.853 --> 00:44:05.853
They said, "We want to be primitive."

00:44:05.853 --> 00:44:08.053
I said, "You cannot be.

00:44:08.053 --> 00:44:09.793
Your brain is modern.

00:44:09.793 --> 00:44:14.943
Just by wearing these primitive things you
cannot be.

00:44:14.943 --> 00:44:18.753
Accept it, accept yourself.

00:44:18.753 --> 00:44:38.683
And now you have your realization and it will
work out."

00:44:38.683 --> 00:44:48.154
So with all these stresses on us -- thinking
too much, futuristic personality â€' you

00:44:48.154 --> 00:44:49.802
develop the stress.

00:44:49.802 --> 00:45:01.233
Now what happens when kundalini rises, you
are beyond thought.

00:45:01.233 --> 00:45:04.053
That's called in Sanskrit as Nirvichar Samadhi
-- thoughtless awareness.

00:45:04.053 --> 00:45:12.953
You are fully aware -- on the contrary, you
are more aware â€' but you are in thoughtless

00:45:12.953 --> 00:45:13.953
awareness.

00:45:13.953 --> 00:45:19.062
Now when I see this carpet in thoughtless
awareness, I don't think.

00:45:19.062 --> 00:45:24.112
I don't think because if I have to think,
"Oh, Baba, this is my carpet.

00:45:24.112 --> 00:45:25.713
Now I have not insured it.

00:45:25.713 --> 00:45:28.673
If somebody will run away with it, then what
will happen?"

00:45:28.673 --> 00:45:30.283
I won't be able to give any speech or anything.

00:45:30.283 --> 00:45:36.233
I'll be worried about the carpet only.

00:45:36.233 --> 00:45:39.223
But when I look at this carpet, I don't think.

00:45:39.223 --> 00:45:48.903
Only the joy of the creation of this carpet
is just pouring into Me; a beautiful blissful

00:45:48.903 --> 00:45:50.533
feeling, that's all.

00:45:50.533 --> 00:45:52.973
I am not thinking.

00:45:52.973 --> 00:46:04.102
Like a very still beautiful lake which has
no ripples reflects all the beauty that is

00:46:04.102 --> 00:46:05.953
around it, fully.

00:46:05.953 --> 00:46:18.443
A complete joy is reflected in a mind which
is absolutely still, not reacting, not accepting,

00:46:18.443 --> 00:46:22.243
just seeing, witnessing.

00:46:22.243 --> 00:46:31.463
And this witness state comes into you and
you become a tranquil and a peaceful personality.

00:46:31.463 --> 00:46:39.112
Such peace that such a person, wherever he
goes, wherever he walks, a peaceful atmosphere

00:46:39.112 --> 00:46:41.852
prevails.

00:46:41.852 --> 00:46:47.723
The nature, the elements all react to such
a personality.

00:46:47.723 --> 00:46:55.903
Just talking about peace or giving prizes
of peace, you do not feel peace.

00:46:55.903 --> 00:47:01.283
I know of people who have got Nobel Prizes
of peace are horrid.

00:47:01.283 --> 00:47:07.102
They look like some mad dogs.

00:47:07.102 --> 00:47:11.403
If you have to talk to them, take the barge
pole in between.

00:47:11.403 --> 00:47:17.573
Don't know when you'll be hit with the prize
they have got.

00:47:17.573 --> 00:47:23.592
And you may have to pay very dearly for meting
such a personality who is supposed to be the

00:47:23.592 --> 00:47:32.503
foundation of peace and you find it's a fountain
of violence.

00:47:32.503 --> 00:47:42.632
This is the situation today that we are placed
in a society which artificially expresses

00:47:42.632 --> 00:50:11.403
itself.

00:50:11.403 --> 00:50:33.003
There

00:50:33.003 --> 01:23:53.162
is nothing genuine, nothing innate ...
