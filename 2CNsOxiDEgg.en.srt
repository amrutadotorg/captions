1
00:38:49,301 --> 00:38:52,541
I think it came to me about 35 to 40 years back

2
00:38:52,541 --> 00:38:54,341
I cannot say exactly when

3
00:38:55,281 --> 00:38:56,281
and

4
00:38:57,521 --> 00:38:59,781
the music and these ghazals

5
00:39:00,601 --> 00:39:02,881
all that i remember very well

6
00:39:03,481 --> 00:39:07,181
for a long time when we went to india and all that

7
00:39:07,961 --> 00:39:10,461
it was quite lost i mean i could never see him

8
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:17,001
but suddendly, once, at the airport i saw him and i was extremly happ to see him there

9
00:39:18,021 --> 00:39:22,301
i have not heared his music for so many days

10
00:39:22,801 --> 00:39:25,961
then he said that i would like to sing to you mother sometimes

11
00:39:27,241 --> 00:39:29,021
again we got lost with him

12
00:39:30,021 --> 00:39:34,361
and then the other day when he got Padma Shri i was so happy

13
00:39:35,021 --> 00:39:36,541
then he left

14
00:39:42,961 --> 00:39:45,761
i was so proud because i know

15
00:39:45,921 --> 00:39:49,681
he had to struggle a lot. All the artists have to struggle a lot

16
00:39:50,121 --> 00:39:52,881
you see financially. otherwise also

17
00:39:53,661 --> 00:39:56,621
the saraswati pujaris have always to suffer

18
00:39:56,941 --> 00:40:00,121
from the neglect of laxmi

19
00:40:01,141 --> 00:40:05,461
and I (INAUDIBLE) very much that such a great artist

20
00:40:06,041 --> 00:40:10,001
and he cannot have his proper rewards

21
00:40:11,681 --> 00:40:16,561
and that was the time when they have startet that the classical music was going down and down and down (a little bit there) there?)

22
00:40:16,941 --> 00:40:20,401
all sort of cheap music was comming up

23
00:40:22,941 --> 00:40:25,221
But i am so happy that he has been recognised

24
00:40:25,401 --> 00:40:29,821
(however how much?) and the great artist who have recognised a long time back

25
00:40:30,361 --> 00:40:31,581
and that

26
00:40:32,321 --> 00:40:34,501
he as such a good name everywhere

27
00:40:35,381 --> 00:40:38,661
he is a very good man very innnocent person

28
00:40:39,061 --> 00:40:43,181
and i hope one day he will come to cabella to give us a music conzert
