00:46.390 --> 00:54.199
you know no no - the child they normally

00:50.629 --> 00:57.440
would be replaced the prophetess turn us

00:54.199 --> 01:00.350
into karate demand rain medicine demo

00:57.440 --> 01:03.170
pseudo poverty spattering they were

01:00.350 --> 01:07.610
simply genetically mediated the ProQuest

01:03.170 --> 01:10.880
was in Jerusalem and she I'm so happy

01:07.610 --> 01:14.509
that in Italy people have so much

01:10.880 --> 01:20.300
respect for my dear mother and also for

01:14.509 --> 01:23.810
Madonna surprising why they did not

01:20.300 --> 01:27.280
describe about Christ's mother in the

01:23.810 --> 01:31.340
Bible the last words spoken of Christ

01:27.280 --> 01:33.649
where he say behold the mother in all

01:31.340 --> 01:35.569
other scriptures of the world this

01:33.649 --> 01:37.399
primordial mother is respect and

01:35.569 --> 01:40.840
everybody has talked about that that

01:37.399 --> 01:40.840
she's the power she's the ship

01:58.750 --> 02:01.810
[Music]

02:04.690 --> 02:12.669
[Applause]

02:19.480 --> 02:33.110
I think it's it's a little fragile it

02:28.670 --> 03:00.780
was it was repaid by misogyny and

02:33.110 --> 03:03.780
repainted it is said that

03:00.780 --> 03:07.830
in the ten commandments whatever is

03:03.780 --> 03:12.270
created by the heavens and by the earth

03:07.830 --> 03:17.220
should not be recreated and reproduced

03:12.270 --> 03:22.050
and worshipped so the incarnations are

03:17.220 --> 03:24.270
created by the heavens only in modern

03:22.050 --> 03:29.340
times it is possible to take a

03:24.270 --> 03:34.459
photograph of the incarnation but in the

03:29.340 --> 03:38.060
former days there was no possibility now

03:34.459 --> 03:42.290
whatever is created by the mother earth

03:38.060 --> 03:46.560
is what has come out of the mother earth

03:42.290 --> 03:49.530
which is the swayambhu is created by the

03:46.560 --> 03:53.150
mother earth now we have everywhere we

03:49.530 --> 03:55.890
find the same blue things

03:53.150 --> 03:59.720
another thing is some realized Souls

03:55.890 --> 04:07.470
also have made beautiful statue

03:59.720 --> 04:10.560
there was one fellow in Russia supposed

04:07.470 --> 04:12.540
to be very intelligent he said that all

04:10.560 --> 04:16.620
right if we keep mother's photograph and

04:12.540 --> 04:21.209
also the icons we can get the same type

04:16.620 --> 04:25.500
of vibration you cannot because icons

04:21.209 --> 04:28.710
are made by some artists imaginary these

04:25.500 --> 04:30.900
are not representing actually even Maria

04:28.710 --> 04:35.400
or Christ or anyone they are all all

04:30.900 --> 04:39.560
imaginary if an Italian once makes

04:35.400 --> 04:44.640
Christ he is Italian stuff he somebody

04:39.560 --> 04:49.500
French one makes is thin like French if

04:44.640 --> 04:52.580
you get somebody say from Holland he'll

04:49.500 --> 04:52.580
have a forehead like that

04:52.729 --> 05:00.690
you see all of them

04:55.610 --> 05:02.539
they depict Christ as they want to then

05:00.690 --> 05:07.470
we have Maria the same way

05:02.539 --> 05:10.710
her expression her photograph everything

05:07.470 --> 05:13.860
is all according to the imagination of

05:10.710 --> 05:18.720
the artists and to whatever country we

05:13.860 --> 05:21.419
belong that way and they are not free

05:18.720 --> 05:24.770
you can see they are not free because

05:21.419 --> 05:29.400
all these artists have a certain style

05:24.770 --> 05:33.750
now if it is a Rembrandt it's a style if

05:29.400 --> 05:35.729
it is a Leonardo it's a style though

05:33.750 --> 05:38.250
they are born realized still they have a

05:35.729 --> 05:39.870
style nobody is like this that he make

05:38.250 --> 05:42.080
today like these tomorrow like this

05:39.870 --> 05:47.090
there's no freedom

05:42.080 --> 05:47.090
they are bound by their own styles

05:47.720 --> 05:54.810
everybody has one style and that is the

05:51.000 --> 05:58.349
style they follow because what is that

05:54.810 --> 06:01.530
his reason is they must have done three

05:58.349 --> 06:06.210
four times style type styles must have

06:01.530 --> 06:10.020
done sure but people must have rejected

06:06.210 --> 06:12.780
this is no good this is no good so it's

06:10.020 --> 06:14.400
all to see opinion of the people so they

06:12.780 --> 06:17.610
must have taken to one style all right

06:14.400 --> 06:19.590
this is the stand so you can see Christ

06:17.610 --> 06:22.699
if he's Japanese

06:19.590 --> 06:22.699
he'll have [ __ ] eyes

06:23.789 --> 06:34.180
if he is Chinese she'll have no nose if

06:29.860 --> 06:38.949
it's Indian he'll be doubt so all kinds

06:34.180 --> 06:44.379
of crisis II and I feel that how can

06:38.949 --> 06:47.800
they emit vibrations tell me while with

06:44.379 --> 06:50.740
my photograph our cunning company now

06:47.800 --> 06:52.990
when we say that we should not worship

06:50.740 --> 06:55.330
in the Bible it is written that we

06:52.990 --> 06:58.479
should not worship anything that is

06:55.330 --> 07:00.879
reproduced and created by the mother

06:58.479 --> 07:03.129
earth and the heavens now what is it

07:00.879 --> 07:05.560
what is it created by the mother earth

07:03.129 --> 07:08.080
and by the heaven which we should not

07:05.560 --> 07:10.150
reproduce this nobody tried to find out

07:08.080 --> 07:13.599
they think that you are not allowed to

07:10.150 --> 07:16.990
worship any form it's all

07:13.599 --> 07:20.139
misinterpretation it's completely

07:16.990 --> 07:24.879
misinterpretation I'll tell you very in

07:20.139 --> 07:29.050
Paris a church called what is it called

07:24.879 --> 07:33.099
them or not reserved and the under

07:29.050 --> 07:35.199
statue of Mary and Christ is celebrating

07:33.099 --> 07:37.419
from outside you can see the vibrations

07:35.199 --> 07:40.659
are coming out now this must have been

07:37.419 --> 07:41.409
made by some very great artist who was a

07:40.659 --> 07:46.210
realized soul

07:41.409 --> 07:51.789
for example the Sistine Chapel ego has

07:46.210 --> 07:53.860
got a very beautiful frescoes of Christ

07:51.789 --> 07:58.930
and all that and if you see that Christ

07:53.860 --> 08:02.020
I mean it's absolutely vibrate but down

07:58.930 --> 08:06.639
below there's a big table on which to

08:02.020 --> 08:10.000
have put Christ just very miserable

08:06.639 --> 08:11.590
creature which is never near Christ I

08:10.000 --> 08:14.469
mean it's impossible that Christ would

08:11.590 --> 08:18.250
be like that so miserable ugly looking

08:14.469 --> 08:20.469
thin burnout hopelessness

08:18.250 --> 08:25.180
how can he be Christ I can't understand

08:20.469 --> 08:26.830
he carried a complete huge big cross

08:25.180 --> 08:29.169
upon himself do you think these bowls

08:26.830 --> 08:32.079
could have can and this was placed just

08:29.169 --> 08:35.800
below where Sistine Chapel you find the

08:32.079 --> 08:38.390
Christ and energy boy how can it be

08:35.800 --> 08:42.620
also the mother of Christ is always

08:38.390 --> 08:46.190
shown as a fat person modern fashion

08:42.620 --> 08:51.790
that should become like a mosquito you

08:46.190 --> 08:56.720
will go is a famous painting Mona Lisa

08:51.790 --> 08:59.590
he was a very fat is all the trace of

08:56.720 --> 09:03.580
the intervenors you are playing into

08:59.590 --> 09:07.820
they are making a fool out of everyone

09:03.580 --> 09:13.580
the divine personality needs water to

09:07.820 --> 09:16.250
protect the center I'll do an example of

09:13.580 --> 09:19.010
Mona Lisa if you see Mona Lisa I mean I

09:16.250 --> 09:21.860
don't know she cannot be an actress she

09:19.010 --> 09:26.270
cannot win any beauty contests I think

09:21.860 --> 09:31.130
she her face is very serene very

09:26.270 --> 09:33.110
motherly very pure her eyes and why is

09:31.130 --> 09:35.720
it that she's eternally so much

09:33.110 --> 09:37.160
appreciated the reason is there is

09:35.720 --> 09:40.010
Ganesh impersonator

09:37.160 --> 09:43.070
she's a mother and the story about that

09:40.010 --> 09:45.620
one is that this lady had lost her child

09:43.070 --> 09:47.990
and she would never spoil she would

09:45.620 --> 09:50.450
never cry and one little child was

09:47.990 --> 09:53.600
brought to her when she saw the child

09:50.450 --> 09:56.030
then the spine that came on her face of

09:53.600 --> 09:58.910
that love for the child is being

09:56.030 --> 10:01.190
depicted by this great artist and that's

09:58.910 --> 10:02.630
why people are appreciating it and you

10:01.190 --> 10:06.080
have seen in the West though the people

10:02.630 --> 10:09.590
don't show much interest in the mother

10:06.080 --> 10:11.950
child relationships anywhere you go is

10:09.590 --> 10:14.090
the mother and child theme is the best

10:11.950 --> 10:16.130
they'd show you photograph this is

10:14.090 --> 10:18.290
mother and child this is Christ mother

10:16.130 --> 10:20.240
and child when the Christ was brought

10:18.290 --> 10:21.530
down the mother is there they have to

10:20.240 --> 10:24.500
have mother and her child

10:21.530 --> 10:27.350
principal acting otherwise that picture

10:24.500 --> 10:29.720
is not regarded as something great or

10:27.350 --> 10:34.540
you have to have actually Christ who is

10:29.720 --> 10:34.540
a Ganesh principal himself to be sure

10:40.819 --> 10:47.160
he wants to know about the appearance of

10:43.860 --> 10:50.399
Holy Mary for example in Fatima on other

10:47.160 --> 10:53.790
addresses mitre is quite possible you

10:50.399 --> 10:56.730
see one of my photographs where people

10:53.790 --> 10:59.910
are taking photographs and she's there

10:56.730 --> 11:05.790
she's appeared before me also it's

10:59.910 --> 11:10.559
possible I went to Portugal and they had

11:05.790 --> 11:17.129
a festival of the Lady of the rocks so I

11:10.559 --> 11:21.120
went to see that place and there was a

11:17.129 --> 11:25.199
very small little statue of this diamond

11:21.120 --> 11:29.420
height of the middle about say five

11:25.199 --> 11:34.740
inches and the face was just like mine

11:29.420 --> 11:38.850
exactly like mine they said that this

11:34.740 --> 11:42.809
was found suddenly by two children who

11:38.850 --> 11:47.639
were following a rabbit which hid inside

11:42.809 --> 11:49.769
a niche so these children saw some light

11:47.639 --> 11:54.480
inside the niche and they started

11:49.769 --> 11:56.490
following under a rock and they reached

11:54.480 --> 12:00.180
the source of the light was the statue

11:56.490 --> 12:02.430
they brought it out and in that light

12:00.180 --> 12:04.680
they walked and when the people outside

12:02.430 --> 12:06.120
where lots of people were gathered they

12:04.680 --> 12:09.059
were amazed to see that they brought out

12:06.120 --> 12:13.250
the statue from somewhere inside so they

12:09.059 --> 12:17.250
worshiped that that statue in that place

12:13.250 --> 12:22.529
now please think these statues give you

12:17.250 --> 12:27.870
vibrations as I give you vibrations but

12:22.529 --> 12:30.839
not so much as I give it and all the

12:27.870 --> 12:35.250
other statues also there may be many who

12:30.839 --> 12:38.670
might be giving you vibrations and also

12:35.250 --> 12:41.670
there was an operation of her first I

12:38.670 --> 12:44.999
never believed that it could be but then

12:41.670 --> 12:49.110
after feeling the vibrations now I know

12:44.999 --> 12:52.740
it was true that she did appear here in

12:49.110 --> 12:53.939
an operation she appeared before me also

12:52.740 --> 12:58.259
you must have seen

12:53.939 --> 12:59.849
in a photograph of course I like

12:58.259 --> 13:03.659
paintings very much up for a file

12:59.849 --> 13:06.149
specially because he has drawn the

13:03.659 --> 13:09.959
mother's face and the child's face so

13:06.149 --> 13:15.059
exactly expressing the feeling of mother

13:09.959 --> 13:18.659
entity and imagine that picture appears

13:15.059 --> 13:20.729
in the sky and I didn't tell them to

13:18.659 --> 13:24.359
show that the father when I was sleeping

13:20.729 --> 13:27.539
I was not even going to look at it but

13:24.359 --> 13:31.339
at this time the hollow that was on the

13:27.539 --> 13:34.079
backside of Bailey comes up on the head

13:31.339 --> 13:36.439
in Suffern himself innate or I don't

13:34.079 --> 13:39.329
know how can I explain this

13:36.439 --> 13:44.159
paramchaitanya is doing all kinds of

13:39.329 --> 13:49.769
things and it does all these just to

13:44.159 --> 13:52.999
convince you about sahaja yoga we have

13:49.769 --> 13:57.779
seen photographs of angels around me so

13:52.999 --> 14:03.149
try to be simple innocent not reacting

13:57.779 --> 14:05.989
and keep quiet and peaceful because here

14:03.149 --> 14:08.970
we are talking about the global

14:05.989 --> 14:11.459
transformation where people will find

14:08.970 --> 14:17.659
their peace in that heart and will

14:11.459 --> 14:17.659
establish a new world of peace joy

14:19.369 --> 14:22.369
