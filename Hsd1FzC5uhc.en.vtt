00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.500
You can hear me there? All of you?

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.500
Those you can't hear me raise your hand

00:00:32.291 --> 00:00:34.500
Alright! thank you

00:00:53.208 --> 00:00:56.500
So you better sing one song

00:00:58.125 --> 00:01:06.417
I'm sorry ,they told me now that people waiting

00:01:25.417 --> 00:01:30.417
"The Music of Joy"
"Ayi Singha Pe Sawar, Maiya"

00:08:35.417 --> 00:08:41.417
Very nice to see you all so happy here.

00:08:43.667 --> 00:08:46.750
Today is the second day

00:08:49.583 --> 00:08:59.500
and is a very important day from the point of evolution.

00:09:02.333 --> 00:09:13.417
As you know that our second chakra is very important.

00:09:14.667 --> 00:09:18.125
That's why today is very important.

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:22.375
So what is the second chakra?

00:09:22.667 --> 00:09:25.875
Do you know which one is the second chakra?

00:09:30.875 --> 00:09:32.583
Ah? What did they say?

00:09:44.875 --> 00:09:47.125
You must tell loudly.

00:09:53.125 --> 00:09:59.125
Swadisthan is the chakra, is very important because

00:09:59.417 --> 00:10:06.125
in this Kali Yuga, Swadisthana works the most.

00:10:06.417 --> 00:10:13.583
We have so many agents to make it work

00:10:13.875 --> 00:10:19.333
to make it work and work very hard.

00:10:19.792 --> 00:10:23.125
You know what is in second chakra.

00:10:24.792 --> 00:10:30.417
In the second chakra what happens

00:10:31.667 --> 00:10:35.875
that we are caught up by our ambition

00:10:37.875 --> 00:10:41.417
and the ambition makes you run up and down,

00:10:41.667 --> 00:10:47.333
and I've seen many Sahaja Yogis also getting lost,

00:10:47.583 --> 00:10:52.875
so it's a very important day for all of you.

00:10:58.583 --> 00:11:01.667
So second chakra is important because

00:11:02.041 --> 00:11:06.041
in modern times it is very, very

00:11:06.333 --> 00:11:10.792
cosmic as well as active.

00:11:13.125 --> 00:11:15.709
We become very active, over active,

00:11:16.041 --> 00:11:25.125
and we start thinking about everyone with whom we are not concerned

00:11:25.709 --> 00:11:28.792
and bothering our heads.

00:11:29.125 --> 00:11:34.542
So today's chakra is important because it bothers your head,

00:11:35.792 --> 00:11:37.583
it troubles you a lot

00:11:37.875 --> 00:11:40.583
and you start thinking about them.

00:11:43.125 --> 00:11:49.041
You start thinking what have you said, what has happened,

00:11:49.333 --> 00:11:53.041
who is angry, all sorts of nonsense.

00:11:55.333 --> 00:11:57.458
You are all Sahaja yogis,

00:11:58.583 --> 00:12:01.709
so you shouldn't worry as to all these people,

00:12:02.041 --> 00:12:03.709
what they say, what they are doing.

00:12:04.041 --> 00:12:08.250
You should just enjoy yourself.

00:12:08.542 --> 00:12:11.709
Second chakra you must enjoy.

00:12:12.041 --> 00:12:15.792
That's the best way to enjoy Sahaja Yoga.

00:12:19.917 --> 00:12:22.917
Where your Swadisthana is satisfied

00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:28.542
nothing can destroy you or disturb you.

00:12:29.458 --> 00:12:33.542
At Swadisthana you can really look after;

00:12:33.792 --> 00:12:39.208
Swadisthan Chakra is so much good for you because

00:12:39.542 --> 00:12:44.625
now you are Sahaja Yogis and you can master it.

00:12:44.917 --> 00:12:50.041
That is one chakra which upsets, especially in the West

00:12:50.333 --> 00:12:52.542
people think too much, all the time

00:12:52.792 --> 00:12:54.625
thinking, thinking, thinking.

00:12:56.333 --> 00:12:58.333
That's from Swadisthan,

00:12:58.625 --> 00:13:03.041
you get that problem from Swadisthan.

00:13:04.333 --> 00:13:08.917
To satisfy Swadisthan, you have to take to silence.

00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:17.709
You have to take to quietude and look at yourself.

00:13:18.041 --> 00:13:24.166
What is bothering you, what is troubling you,

00:13:24.458 --> 00:13:27.542
what gives you ideas and thoughts

00:13:27.834 --> 00:13:30.041
is Swadisthan.

00:13:30.375 --> 00:13:33.041
And some people think so much.

00:13:36.375 --> 00:13:39.542
There may not be any problem,

00:13:39.834 --> 00:13:43.917
but they create their own problem with the Swadisthana

00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:49.458
and just go on bothering about the stuff.

00:13:49.709 --> 00:13:53.542
Swadisthan is very happy

00:13:53.834 --> 00:13:56.709
when you are just laughing and enjoying

00:13:57.083 --> 00:14:00.083
and not bothered about nonsense.

00:14:00.375 --> 00:14:03.959
How much time we waste on nonsense!

00:14:05.166 --> 00:14:06.917
We don't need it,

00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:09.458
Sahaja Yogis don't need it.

00:14:09.709 --> 00:14:13.375
It's only those who are not yet realized

00:14:13.667 --> 00:14:20.458
must be suffering. They do suffer
and they might even trouble you, but just laugh at it

00:14:20.709 --> 00:14:27.834
and you must pardon them, forgive them, because they are doing this

00:14:29.083 --> 00:14:33.250
because they can't help it.

00:14:34.583 --> 00:14:39.583
You see, this Swadisthan Chakra is bothering them

00:14:39.834 --> 00:14:41.375
so they can't help it.

00:14:42.375 --> 00:14:44.625
You don't have space.

00:14:44.917 --> 00:14:47.834
Come forward a little bit, poor man.

00:14:51.375 --> 00:14:52.750
I'm sorry.

00:15:00.083 --> 00:15:03.291
You can come forward, here there is seat,

00:15:03.583 --> 00:15:06.458
some people make room for them.

00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:26.583
Ah good, and move forward, please.

00:15:27.166 --> 00:15:30.583
You bring your harmonium and you come forward.

00:15:41.375 --> 00:15:45.583
Are you going to dance? Good.

00:16:13.834 --> 00:16:17.166
So now, don't allow your mind

00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:21.291
to bother about whatever nonsensical thoughts are coming

00:16:21.583 --> 00:16:26.792
- all kinds of, all kinds of nonsensical thoughts.

00:16:27.041 --> 00:16:31.500
You have nothing to do with them, but the thoughts are coming

00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:35.834
Now, this is the work of Mister Swadisthan.

00:16:37.166 --> 00:16:40.375
He's trying to distract you,

00:16:40.625 --> 00:16:42.917
you must get into silence.

00:16:46.291 --> 00:16:48.291
Once you get into silence,

00:16:49.583 --> 00:16:53.750
then he will go away and don't bother you.

00:16:56.208 --> 00:17:02.834
My all attention is on your country

00:17:03.208 --> 00:17:06.834
because you're very good Sahaja Yogis.

00:17:08.208 --> 00:17:12.500
We have had Sahaja Yogis all over the world,

00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:14.583
you know in thousands they are,

00:17:14.834 --> 00:17:18.583
but nothing like Australian, I see.

00:17:19.834 --> 00:17:26.750
Because they are somehow or other very deeply touched

00:17:27.083 --> 00:17:31.667
and bothered about the world problems.

00:17:33.917 --> 00:17:35.917
So what you have to think now:

00:17:36.291 --> 00:17:40.208
not to have anything to do with Swadisthan,

00:17:40.583 --> 00:17:43.500
but what you have to become

00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:46.667
is you are Sahaja Yogis

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.750
and no Swadisthan should bother you.

00:18:10.083 --> 00:18:13.667
So there was …
I never knew that you were all here,

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.208
now only they told Me that you were all here.

00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:19.000
They said, "Only a few people are there."

00:18:19.291 --> 00:18:21.000
I said, "All right."

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.875
Ah? How many? You have counted them?

00:18:53.875 --> 00:18:54.875
Now, very sweet,

00:18:59.208 --> 00:19:05.000
Australia is really great to have beautiful children like this.

00:19:08.291 --> 00:19:11.208
And people care for children.

00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:15.000
That is first thing you must do is to care for your children.

00:19:15.417 --> 00:19:19.125
That is fighting your Swadisthan.

00:19:20.417 --> 00:19:22.417
Anything bothers you,

00:19:22.667 --> 00:19:25.208
you worry about you own children, finished.

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:34.417
You have to bother about them and everything will work out.

00:19:41.125 --> 00:19:43.417
"What's the matter, are you not are all right?

00:19:45.667 --> 00:19:47.417
You are all right?"

00:20:17.667 --> 00:20:20.417
You are definitely blessed

00:20:20.667 --> 00:20:26.208
because you are not falling to the whims of your Swadisthan.

00:20:27.583 --> 00:20:34.583
Definitely, and that is the chakra of your country also.

00:20:34.875 --> 00:20:41.417
So it makes you run up and down and think and think and think.

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:47.208
Especially all the Sahaja Yogis have this problem.

00:20:47.542 --> 00:20:51.333
So you should just think

00:20:51.583 --> 00:20:55.792
that you are sitting on Swadisthan

00:20:56.125 --> 00:21:05.041
and you have to ride it, not to be ridden by it. All right?

00:21:13.333 --> 00:21:20.125
I'm so proud of you people from this country

00:21:20.417 --> 00:21:24.125
have shown path to the rest of the world

00:21:24.417 --> 00:21:29.125
how can you be united and to be one.

00:21:30.417 --> 00:21:32.875
It's rather very surprising.

00:21:33.417 --> 00:21:37.125
In other countries the problem is different.

00:21:37.417 --> 00:21:43.417
Your country is the problem of Swadisthana as I said today,

00:21:43.709 --> 00:21:46.792
but you people have conquered it.

00:21:50.125 --> 00:21:52.250
When I came first year I found

00:21:52.542 --> 00:21:55.125
everybody's head moving with the Swadisthana.

00:21:57.417 --> 00:22:01.542
Then they became silent and very peaceful

00:22:01.792 --> 00:22:06.041
and now I see you all and I'm very happy

00:22:06.333 --> 00:22:09.333
because that's gone now,

00:22:09.583 --> 00:22:11.875
all that nonsense is finished.

00:22:12.250 --> 00:22:15.458
And there is nothing bothers you.

00:22:22.709 --> 00:22:26.583
The root of all diseases is Swadisthan,

00:22:26.917 --> 00:22:28.917
it comes from there.

00:22:32.250 --> 00:22:35.917
So you should know not to play into hands of Swadisthan

00:22:38.250 --> 00:22:41.250
and go into thinking, thinking, thinking.

00:22:41.542 --> 00:22:45.709
They go on thinking, I mean something that doesn't exist,

00:22:45.792 --> 00:22:47.542
they go on thinking.

00:22:51.041 --> 00:22:53.458
So any such thought comes in you said,

00:22:53.709 --> 00:22:56.583
"We don't want to think," finished.

00:22:57.041 --> 00:23:00.583
I'm there to think for you,

00:23:00.917 --> 00:23:02.917
you don't think.

00:23:03.250 --> 00:23:06.458
If you have any problem, you let Me know,

00:23:06.709 --> 00:23:09.917
but you don't think.

00:23:12.250 --> 00:23:17.709
What you can do, you can write it down and send the problems to Me

00:23:19.041 --> 00:23:21.792
and I would like to see it. All right?

00:23:29.166 --> 00:23:35.792
And then Swadisthana is chakra of your country,

00:23:38.166 --> 00:23:42.041
that is the second chakra and is here.

00:23:43.333 --> 00:23:45.625
And you'll be amazed to know

00:23:45.959 --> 00:23:56.917
that Sahaja Yogis there are from every country,
but Australian ones are something special.

00:23:58.250 --> 00:24:02.375
They have very great faith in themselves.

00:24:05.458 --> 00:24:09.917
They do not go to wrong ideas.

00:24:11.250 --> 00:24:13.375
I've seen that,

00:24:13.625 --> 00:24:16.709
and I am very much thankful to you for that.

00:24:23.458 --> 00:24:27.709
So what other song you want to sing? I would like to hear.

00:24:51.250 --> 00:24:55.709
"The Music of Joy"
"Mata Oh Mata"
