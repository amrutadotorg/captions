00:12.000 --> 00:15.500
You can hear me there? All of you?

00:15.750 --> 00:19.500
Those you can't hear me raise your hand

00:32.291 --> 00:34.500
Alright! thank you

00:53.208 --> 00:56.500
So you better sing one song

00:58.125 --> 01:06.417
I'm sorry ,they told me now that people waiting

01:25.417 --> 01:30.417
"The Music of Joy"
"Ayi Singha Pe Sawar, Maiya"

08:35.417 --> 08:41.417
Very nice to see you all so happy here.

08:43.667 --> 08:46.750
Today is the second day

08:49.583 --> 08:59.500
and is a very important day from the point of evolution.

09:02.333 --> 09:13.417
As you know that our second chakra is very important.

09:14.667 --> 09:18.125
That's why today is very important.

09:20.500 --> 09:22.375
So what is the second chakra?

09:22.667 --> 09:25.875
Do you know which one is the second chakra?

09:30.875 --> 09:32.583
Ah? What did they say?

09:44.875 --> 09:47.125
You must tell loudly.

09:53.125 --> 09:59.125
Swadisthan is the chakra, is very important because

09:59.417 --> 10:06.125
in this Kali Yuga, Swadisthana works the most.

10:06.417 --> 10:13.583
We have so many agents to make it work

10:13.875 --> 10:19.333
to make it work and work very hard.

10:19.792 --> 10:23.125
You know what is in second chakra.

10:24.792 --> 10:30.417
In the second chakra what happens

10:31.667 --> 10:35.875
that we are caught up by our ambition

10:37.875 --> 10:41.417
and the ambition makes you run up and down,

10:41.667 --> 10:47.333
and I've seen many Sahaja Yogis also getting lost,

10:47.583 --> 10:52.875
so it's a very important day for all of you.

10:58.583 --> 11:01.667
So second chakra is important because

11:02.041 --> 11:06.041
in modern times it is very, very

11:06.333 --> 11:10.792
cosmic as well as active.

11:13.125 --> 11:15.709
We become very active, over active,

11:16.041 --> 11:25.125
and we start thinking about everyone with whom we are not concerned

11:25.709 --> 11:28.792
and bothering our heads.

11:29.125 --> 11:34.542
So today's chakra is important because it bothers your head,

11:35.792 --> 11:37.583
it troubles you a lot

11:37.875 --> 11:40.583
and you start thinking about them.

11:43.125 --> 11:49.041
You start thinking what have you said, what has happened,

11:49.333 --> 11:53.041
who is angry, all sorts of nonsense.

11:55.333 --> 11:57.458
You are all Sahaja yogis,

11:58.583 --> 12:01.709
so you shouldn't worry as to all these people,

12:02.041 --> 12:03.709
what they say, what they are doing.

12:04.041 --> 12:08.250
You should just enjoy yourself.

12:08.542 --> 12:11.709
Second chakra you must enjoy.

12:12.041 --> 12:15.792
That's the best way to enjoy Sahaja Yoga.

12:19.917 --> 12:22.917
Where your Swadisthana is satisfied

12:24.250 --> 12:28.542
nothing can destroy you or disturb you.

12:29.458 --> 12:33.542
At Swadisthana you can really look after;

12:33.792 --> 12:39.208
Swadisthan Chakra is so much good for you because

12:39.542 --> 12:44.625
now you are Sahaja Yogis and you can master it.

12:44.917 --> 12:50.041
That is one chakra which upsets, especially in the West

12:50.333 --> 12:52.542
people think too much, all the time

12:52.792 --> 12:54.625
thinking, thinking, thinking.

12:56.333 --> 12:58.333
That's from Swadisthan,

12:58.625 --> 13:03.041
you get that problem from Swadisthan.

13:04.333 --> 13:08.917
To satisfy Swadisthan, you have to take to silence.

13:10.250 --> 13:17.709
You have to take to quietude and look at yourself.

13:18.041 --> 13:24.166
What is bothering you, what is troubling you,

13:24.458 --> 13:27.542
what gives you ideas and thoughts

13:27.834 --> 13:30.041
is Swadisthan.

13:30.375 --> 13:33.041
And some people think so much.

13:36.375 --> 13:39.542
There may not be any problem,

13:39.834 --> 13:43.917
but they create their own problem with the Swadisthana

13:44.250 --> 13:49.458
and just go on bothering about the stuff.

13:49.709 --> 13:53.542
Swadisthan is very happy

13:53.834 --> 13:56.709
when you are just laughing and enjoying

13:57.083 --> 14:00.083
and not bothered about nonsense.

14:00.375 --> 14:03.959
How much time we waste on nonsense!

14:05.166 --> 14:06.917
We don't need it,

14:07.250 --> 14:09.458
Sahaja Yogis don't need it.

14:09.709 --> 14:13.375
It's only those who are not yet realized

14:13.667 --> 14:20.458
must be suffering. They do suffer
and they might even trouble you, but just laugh at it

14:20.709 --> 14:27.834
and you must pardon them, forgive them, because they are doing this

14:29.083 --> 14:33.250
because they can't help it.

14:34.583 --> 14:39.583
You see, this Swadisthan Chakra is bothering them

14:39.834 --> 14:41.375
so they can't help it.

14:42.375 --> 14:44.625
You don't have space.

14:44.917 --> 14:47.834
Come forward a little bit, poor man.

14:51.375 --> 14:52.750
I'm sorry.

15:00.083 --> 15:03.291
You can come forward, here there is seat,

15:03.583 --> 15:06.458
some people make room for them.

15:23.750 --> 15:26.583
Ah good, and move forward, please.

15:27.166 --> 15:30.583
You bring your harmonium and you come forward.

15:41.375 --> 15:45.583
Are you going to dance? Good.

16:13.834 --> 16:17.166
So now, don't allow your mind

16:17.500 --> 16:21.291
to bother about whatever nonsensical thoughts are coming

16:21.583 --> 16:26.792
- all kinds of, all kinds of nonsensical thoughts.

16:27.041 --> 16:31.500
You have nothing to do with them, but the thoughts are coming

16:31.750 --> 16:35.834
Now, this is the work of Mister Swadisthan.

16:37.166 --> 16:40.375
He's trying to distract you,

16:40.625 --> 16:42.917
you must get into silence.

16:46.291 --> 16:48.291
Once you get into silence,

16:49.583 --> 16:53.750
then he will go away and don't bother you.

16:56.208 --> 17:02.834
My all attention is on your country

17:03.208 --> 17:06.834
because you're very good Sahaja Yogis.

17:08.208 --> 17:12.500
We have had Sahaja Yogis all over the world,

17:12.750 --> 17:14.583
you know in thousands they are,

17:14.834 --> 17:18.583
but nothing like Australian, I see.

17:19.834 --> 17:26.750
Because they are somehow or other very deeply touched

17:27.083 --> 17:31.667
and bothered about the world problems.

17:33.917 --> 17:35.917
So what you have to think now:

17:36.291 --> 17:40.208
not to have anything to do with Swadisthan,

17:40.583 --> 17:43.500
but what you have to become

17:43.750 --> 17:46.667
is you are Sahaja Yogis

17:48.000 --> 17:51.750
and no Swadisthan should bother you.

18:10.083 --> 18:13.667
So there was â€¦
I never knew that you were all here,

18:14.000 --> 18:17.208
now only they told Me that you were all here.

18:17.500 --> 18:19.000
They said, "Only a few people are there."

18:19.291 --> 18:21.000
I said, "All right."

18:30.000 --> 18:31.875
Ah? How many? You have counted them?

18:53.875 --> 18:54.875
Now, very sweet,

18:59.208 --> 19:05.000
Australia is really great to have beautiful children like this.

19:08.291 --> 19:11.208
And people care for children.

19:11.500 --> 19:15.000
That is first thing you must do is to care for your children.

19:15.417 --> 19:19.125
That is fighting your Swadisthan.

19:20.417 --> 19:22.417
Anything bothers you,

19:22.667 --> 19:25.208
you worry about you own children, finished.

19:28.500 --> 19:34.417
You have to bother about them and everything will work out.

19:41.125 --> 19:43.417
"What's the matter, are you not are all right?

19:45.667 --> 19:47.417
You are all right?"

20:17.667 --> 20:20.417
You are definitely blessed

20:20.667 --> 20:26.208
because you are not falling to the whims of your Swadisthan.

20:27.583 --> 20:34.583
Definitely, and that is the chakra of your country also.

20:34.875 --> 20:41.417
So it makes you run up and down and think and think and think.

20:42.500 --> 20:47.208
Especially all the Sahaja Yogis have this problem.

20:47.542 --> 20:51.333
So you should just think

20:51.583 --> 20:55.792
that you are sitting on Swadisthan

20:56.125 --> 21:05.041
and you have to ride it, not to be ridden by it. All right?

21:13.333 --> 21:20.125
I'm so proud of you people from this country

21:20.417 --> 21:24.125
have shown path to the rest of the world

21:24.417 --> 21:29.125
how can you be united and to be one.

21:30.417 --> 21:32.875
It's rather very surprising.

21:33.417 --> 21:37.125
In other countries the problem is different.

21:37.417 --> 21:43.417
Your country is the problem of Swadisthana as I said today,

21:43.709 --> 21:46.792
but you people have conquered it.

21:50.125 --> 21:52.250
When I came first year I found

21:52.542 --> 21:55.125
everybody's head moving with the Swadisthana.

21:57.417 --> 22:01.542
Then they became silent and very peaceful

22:01.792 --> 22:06.041
and now I see you all and I'm very happy

22:06.333 --> 22:09.333
because that's gone now,

22:09.583 --> 22:11.875
all that nonsense is finished.

22:12.250 --> 22:15.458
And there is nothing bothers you.

22:22.709 --> 22:26.583
The root of all diseases is Swadisthan,

22:26.917 --> 22:28.917
it comes from there.

22:32.250 --> 22:35.917
So you should know not to play into hands of Swadisthan

22:38.250 --> 22:41.250
and go into thinking, thinking, thinking.

22:41.542 --> 22:45.709
They go on thinking, I mean something that doesn't exist,

22:45.792 --> 22:47.542
they go on thinking.

22:51.041 --> 22:53.458
So any such thought comes in you said,

22:53.709 --> 22:56.583
"We don't want to think," finished.

22:57.041 --> 23:00.583
I'm there to think for you,

23:00.917 --> 23:02.917
you don't think.

23:03.250 --> 23:06.458
If you have any problem, you let Me know,

23:06.709 --> 23:09.917
but you don't think.

23:12.250 --> 23:17.709
What you can do, you can write it down and send the problems to Me

23:19.041 --> 23:21.792
and I would like to see it. All right?

23:29.166 --> 23:35.792
And then Swadisthana is chakra of your country,

23:38.166 --> 23:42.041
that is the second chakra and is here.

23:43.333 --> 23:45.625
And you'll be amazed to know

23:45.959 --> 23:56.917
that Sahaja Yogis there are from every country,
but Australian ones are something special.

23:58.250 --> 24:02.375
They have very great faith in themselves.

24:05.458 --> 24:09.917
They do not go to wrong ideas.

24:11.250 --> 24:13.375
I've seen that,

24:13.625 --> 24:16.709
and I am very much thankful to you for that.

24:23.458 --> 24:27.709
So what other song you want to sing? I would like to hear.

24:51.250 --> 24:55.709
"The Music of Joy"
"Mata Oh Mata"
