00:37.836 --> 00:47.151
I’m sorry what has happened yesterday, but I think the war has begun between the evil and good

00:47.151 --> 00:52.701
and after all the good prevails.

00:52.701 --> 01:06.433
In these modern times, evil used to prevail on good but now in this Krita Yuga,

01:06.433 --> 01:18.464
the evil will be completely conquered by good, and not only that, but good will spread all over.

01:29.811 --> 01:45.042
The evil has the capacity to go to extremes and then to fall out of the evolutionary process completely.

01:46.617 --> 01:58.666
Because they are blind they cannot see the good that’s why they are evil.

02:00.724 --> 02:08.278
If they could see the good they would give up their evil.

02:08.278 --> 02:17.055
In our country which is a country of yoga, especially Maharastra which is the country of the saints,

02:17.055 --> 02:23.221
I was amazed to hear what people are up to.

02:23.231 --> 02:31.962
One of the real source of this nonsense seems to be Rajneesh, the horrible fellow, because

02:31.972 --> 02:40.521
he has made an exhibition here absolutely denouncing all the deities and saying all

02:40.531 --> 02:47.161
kinds of dirty things, and I think the chief
minister of this place is also hand in glove

02:47.171 --> 02:54.952
with him and they are all trying to prove that there is no God, there is no spirituality.

02:54.962 --> 03:04.991
They want to establish that science is everything.

03:05.001 --> 03:13.682
We have no heritage of science in India, we have the heritage of spirituality.

03:13.692 --> 03:22.892
I mean nobody is known as such a great scientist
in this country.

03:22.902 --> 03:32.562
Nobody has made any special inventions and the way people are organising it in the name

03:32.572 --> 03:38.372
of science, there is hardly anyone who has done anything of science.

03:38.382 --> 03:45.671
So it’s the evil which has taken this new form of talking about science and denouncing God

03:45.671 --> 03:51.728
Of course in the West also the same thing has happened to a great extent but not to that extent.

03:51.728 --> 03:57.216
They have not discarded everything that was spiritual.

03:57.545 --> 04:03.983
But here they have gone headlong, those few people who are there, very, very few, but they are there.

04:03.983 --> 04:12.123
So it’s a very bad growth in this country, it won’t survive I know, it cannot survive

04:12.123 --> 04:15.861
because this country is so full of spirituality.

04:15.861 --> 04:23.394
In the West, because people took to science, they have lost all culture of society.

04:23.394 --> 04:27.371
There is no culture of society.

04:27.371 --> 04:33.871
The etiquettes are limited to fork and spoon or how you wish each other.

04:33.871 --> 04:35.753
There is no other culture.

04:35.753 --> 04:39.593
It’s so outside, there is nothing deep really.

04:39.593 --> 04:47.205
Because they have taken absolutely to the modern, or we can say that

04:47.205 --> 05:01.906
it's the industrial evolution of the people, they have taken to all that and have lost contact with reality.

05:02.453 --> 05:11.965
The culture of any country can only survive on spirituality.

05:11.965 --> 05:25.612
Science cannot talk of this and it has so many limitations that it cannot even answer simple few questions that are facing them.

05:25.612 --> 05:40.675
Above all they have no idea what is love, they have no idea what is the all pervading Power.

05:40.675 --> 05:47.256
Now you all have felt it, and you know what it is, and you know how to use it.

05:47.256 --> 05:50.404
So, under these circumstances I find

05:50.404 --> 06:01.862
that those people who are mediocres in Sahaja Yoga cannot help much  for establishing goodness.

06:01.862 --> 06:07.622
You have to be very clean within yourself, you have to be very powerful within yourself

06:07.622 --> 06:10.957
and you have to be extremely sensitive.

06:10.957 --> 06:18.597
So, we are not to waste our energy, our attention onto superficial and nonsensical things.

06:18.597 --> 06:24.409
We have to get out of it and we have to become
people who are detached,

06:24.409 --> 06:27.408
detached from any things which create problems.

06:27.408 --> 06:37.926
If you take a detached view of everything you will have a kind of

06:37.926 --> 06:48.066
a life that will nourish your society which is now sick, is a sick society, is a decadent society.

06:48.066 --> 06:54.450
And for that decadent society you need people who are very morally strong,

06:54.450 --> 07:01.174
who are tremendously pure and who know everything about Sahaja Yoga.

07:01.802 --> 07:07.684
The mediocrity in Sahaja Yoga is very common in the West, very common.

07:07.684 --> 07:12.582
And so much involved into their personal problems that

07:12.582 --> 07:22.856
I cannot understand how will they rise above this nonsensical, personal viewpoint of view.

07:23.241 --> 07:29.151
So, one has to realise that the whole tree that has grown outside so much

07:29.151 --> 07:35.728
due to industrial revolution has to seek its own nourishment

07:35.728 --> 07:40.054
from spirituality which is in India. No doubt.

07:40.466 --> 07:46.903
Spirituality without development has no meaning.

07:47.222 --> 07:52.840
Spirituality has to have development outside otherwise it is lost in the Mother Earth.

07:52.840 --> 07:58.756
It has to sprout and it has to show results, which we are showing no doubt.

07:58.756 --> 08:03.042
In so many ways Indian Sahaja Yogis are trying to show that,

08:03.042 --> 08:06.417
though they are rather slow about that point.

08:06.417 --> 08:11.673
So, it’s something funny that in the West people are rather slow,

08:11.673 --> 08:16.572
Sahaja Yogis are rather slow about their spirituality,

08:16.572 --> 08:25.070
and in India people are rather slow about their manifestation outside.

08:28.195 --> 08:32.332
Unless and until we really do some dedicated effort

08:32.332 --> 08:35.960
it’s not going to work out.

08:35.960 --> 08:42.806
So I hope as we have circulated letters that we have come here

08:42.806 --> 08:51.402
not for fun but for dedication and for our ascent and it’s a pilgrimage.

08:52.675 --> 09:01.474
Talking loose, talking about small things, quarrelling with each other

09:01.474 --> 09:07.830
is out of question of course. But domination, terrible domination

09:07.830 --> 09:12.720
of falsehood, just to think that you are leaders,

09:12.720 --> 09:19.960
or, "Why is he leader?" you know, shows that we are not yet worthy.

09:19.960 --> 09:27.420
So, the worthiness of a ship is very important if it has to fight the turbulence of the sea.

09:27.420 --> 09:34.284
If it cannot fight the turbulence of the sea then it is definitely not seaworthy

09:34.284 --> 09:39.461
and it is absolutely useless because it cannot go across.

09:39.461 --> 09:42.365
In the same way, if you have to be something,

09:42.365 --> 09:46.638
you have to work it out in such a manner that you really become worthy

09:46.638 --> 09:53.278
of crossing this ocean of illusion and that many could cross with you.

09:54.981 --> 10:01.515
As in India they have started at every place,
at every home, at every family, a center.

10:02.283 --> 10:05.582
If they invite people, they talk about nothing
but Sahaja Yoga.

10:05.582 --> 10:11.507
Now you can go all out to talk about it, I give you permission to tell them that I have come

10:11.507 --> 10:14.212
there’s nothing to hide.

10:14.222 --> 10:22.884
And you have to go and open the doors

10:22.884 --> 10:31.945
of many churches and many temples and many organisations and tell them that I am there.

10:31.945 --> 10:35.845
Now the time has come, you can see it so clearly, it’s so obvious.

10:36.286 --> 10:41.266
First, I used to say, "I would not go to the newspapers, this not good that’s not good,

10:41.266 --> 10:43.202
let us work it out."

10:43.202 --> 10:46.700
But it has come now so much, that I have to say things and I am going to say them,

10:46.700 --> 10:50.656
very openly, I am going to say them.

10:50.656 --> 10:53.673
But I want all of you to be such

10:53.673 --> 11:04.576
that nobody should point out a finger at you to say, "Oh, this is a Sahaja Yogi.

11:04.576 --> 11:08.707
And how this Sahaja Yogi is behaving."

11:08.707 --> 11:16.859
If somebody is stupid and not working it out, it's better to get rid of such a person.

11:16.859 --> 11:21.643
Or else help that person and tell him that, "You have to come up.

11:21.643 --> 11:25.305
You can’t be here, we don’t want mediocre people here.

11:25.305 --> 11:32.133
We want some very extraordinarily, pure people.“

11:32.133 --> 11:35.171
The purity is the main point which we have to have.

11:35.171 --> 11:38.772
Once you are pure you don’t have to worry, then I look after you.

11:38.772 --> 11:46.748
But the purity of mind, purity of heart and the purity of your attention, these three things are very important.

11:47.028 --> 11:52.502
When it works out, you’ll be surprised collectivity will grow in no time.

11:52.502 --> 11:59.398
Is a tendency among Sahaja Yogis also, still, to go back to the same materialism

11:59.398 --> 12:05.543
and to try to have your own house, your family, your
children- sort of a nonsense.

12:05.543 --> 12:10.251
We have to be in the ashrams and we have to work it out,

12:10.251 --> 12:14.963
we have to work it out very beautifully that we all live very happily in the ashram.

12:15.042 --> 12:21.972
But I find still people cannot work it out that way.

12:23.112 --> 12:26.825
They are more concerned about their jobs, concerned about their things.

12:26.825 --> 12:30.625
Once you live in the ashram I’ll see that you get everything.

12:30.859 --> 12:39.269
But if you do not want to have the blessings
of God, how can anybody help you?

12:39.269 --> 12:41.859
So, tremendous sacrifice is needed.

12:41.859 --> 12:45.605
Of course, as you know in Sahaja Yoga I don’t need any money from you at all,

12:45.747 --> 12:53.140
but sacrifice is very important, and sacrifice of nonsensical ideas that you have.

12:53.879 --> 12:57.221
In every way we have to show that we are Sahaja
Yogis.

12:57.221 --> 13:01.040
The way you dress up, the way you live, the way you think, the way you behave,

13:01.040 --> 13:03.296
the way you have relationships with each other

13:03.296 --> 13:05.974
and the way you lead your married life

13:05.974 --> 13:10.946
and the way you look at your children.

13:12.751 --> 13:18.313
Unless and until you have purity the light of love will not shine,

13:18.313 --> 13:21.493
the light of love will not shine.

13:21.493 --> 13:26.852
You have to absorb the light of love within yourself.

13:27.042 --> 13:30.973
But you cannot unless and until you are a pure personality.

13:30.973 --> 13:38.810
And that pure personality has to develop by your meditation, by working hard, it’s a question of few years.

13:38.810 --> 13:42.650
In ten years we can change the whole world,
in ten years!

13:42.650 --> 13:45.362
But you have to be really very dedicated.

13:51.255 --> 13:55.916
It is you who has to change, not Me.

13:55.916 --> 13:59.796
You have to work it out, not Me.

14:00.358 --> 14:06.048
I have done my level best but within ten years it should be possible that every Sahaja Yogi

14:06.048 --> 14:09.627
should become a tremendous force of Sahaja Yoga.

14:09.627 --> 14:13.137
So, please try to avoid all those who are mediocres.

14:13.137 --> 14:19.289
If you find mediocrity, the leaders must go all out to correct them,

14:19.289 --> 14:22.053
all out to tell them off. Don’t tolerate.

14:22.053 --> 14:26.532
You don’t have to be very mild on this point.

14:26.532 --> 14:33.263
You have to tell them frankly that, "See now, you are an extremely mediocre person for Sahaja Yoga.

14:33.263 --> 14:36.547
It's not meant for mediocres.

14:36.547 --> 14:40.576
It's not meant for foolish people, it's not meant for stupid people,

14:40.576 --> 14:48.036
it’s meant for something who are ready to sacrifice anything for the sake of truth.“

14:48.215 --> 14:52.585
These people are saying that, "Why don’t you go the way of science?"

14:52.585 --> 14:57.293
I say, "Why don’t you go the way of truth?"

14:57.293 --> 14:59.493
Take to truth.

14:59.493 --> 15:04.215
Science is not truth. Today it might appear, tomorrow it disappears.

15:04.812 --> 15:08.714
Today you may think it is correct but every hypothesis is challenged,

15:08.714 --> 15:13.478
every law is challenged, that’s no law.

15:13.871 --> 15:17.594
You have to use Sahaja Yoga in every practical life, everywhere.

15:17.594 --> 15:20.214
But in no way you have to be fanatic about it.

15:20.336 --> 15:25.538
Like I have seen some people start giving vibrations

15:25.538 --> 15:31.712
or they start moving their hands for bandhans,

15:31.712 --> 15:34.521
even if I am sitting, they are doing like that.

15:34.521 --> 15:42.321
There is no stupidity about it, it has to be very dignified, decent and decorous.

15:44.071 --> 15:49.597
But for that we need really people of quality.

15:49.597 --> 15:54.064
And a complete obedience is needed I must say.

15:54.625 --> 16:00.648
I have told Indian people that time that they must have a proper case done for them.

16:00.648 --> 16:03.848
They just didn’t listen to Me that time, they said, "Mother, why do you want,

16:03.848 --> 16:06.256
you know, you'll be in trouble and all that".

16:06.439 --> 16:11.019
If they had listened to Me there would have been no trouble today.

16:12.404 --> 16:17.348
But you must listen to Me what I say, don’t give Me explanations, don’t give Me logic,

16:17.348 --> 16:20.128
but I know everything you know that.

16:20.128 --> 16:24.561
I know everything.

16:24.778 --> 16:28.978
Now we have something good for you is the list of the marriages.

16:28.978 --> 16:33.638
But marriage is not such an important thing that you think about.

16:34.752 --> 16:40.102
It’s not such an important thing for you that you dedicate all your attention to that.

16:40.102 --> 16:44.246
It’s just by the way, because you have to have a marriage, that’s why.

16:44.246 --> 16:47.106
There’s no need even to have sometimes.

16:47.621 --> 16:55.358
But you have to have it, and then letters after letters about your marriages, about your children, I just don’t want to read that.

16:55.637 --> 16:59.545
Nothing about Sahaja Yoga.

17:00.873 --> 17:05.843
If you are detached, whatever may be the quality of your wife, you will not fall,

17:05.843 --> 17:08.736
whatever may be the quality of your husband, you will not fall.

17:08.915 --> 17:18.152
So one has to be little concerned that: what are we doing?

17:18.152 --> 17:20.673
What have we achieved?

17:21.042 --> 17:26.801
What are we going to give to the world?

17:31.098 --> 17:37.062
For Me, you are my instruments. I don’t have to ask anybody else.

17:37.062 --> 17:40.654
You are my instruments and you have to work it out.

17:40.654 --> 17:46.145
You are not for Me useless people, I worked very hard with you, very hard.

17:46.296 --> 17:49.677
So please don’t waste my energies also

17:49.677 --> 17:56.196
and try to become very good Sahaja Yogis in every way that is possible,

17:56.196 --> 18:02.561
in every way you should be dedicated, in every way try to be something

18:02.561 --> 18:04.531
of very great qualities.

18:04.531 --> 18:09.092
Now you have seen how people have becoming violent and there is a violence on.

18:09.092 --> 18:14.531
Of course, this may not continue but it’s one of the signs that we have to be prepared

18:14.531 --> 18:20.464
to be very strong people, very strong,

18:20.464 --> 18:22.234
and that will work out I’m sure.

18:22.234 --> 18:28.132
They threw about 400 stones at least, maybe more according to the police report

18:28.132 --> 18:30.739
and very few people were hurt.

18:31.142 --> 18:33.042
What does that mean?

18:33.042 --> 18:38.211
That there is somebody who is avoiding all these troubles.

18:42.203 --> 18:46.981
Regarding our tour further, now I have decided we will not go to Atith

18:46.981 --> 18:51.604
because there are- the commissioner, the ESP told Me that it is better not to go,

18:51.604 --> 18:55.020
it's very- these people are very bad and they are criminals.

18:55.020 --> 18:58.910
So, now until the election comes in, they will be behaving like this manner.

18:59.200 --> 19:02.345
After the election of course they will be put down.

19:02.345 --> 19:08.851
So you should go by the understanding of the time and

19:08.851 --> 19:13.781
directly to Sangli, so we’ll go to Sangli, we will have a puja there, you can do shopping whatever you like

19:13.781 --> 19:19.981
and then from there will be going to Ganapatipule.

19:19.981 --> 19:24.367
But it’s not fun, it’s not fun.

19:24.367 --> 19:28.642
It is our development.

19:28.642 --> 19:33.757
Otherwise you will be coming to India, going back the same, empty handed.

19:34.262 --> 19:40.080
I want you, everyone, to be extremely active in your own sphere of life,

19:40.080 --> 19:41.070
talk about Sahaja Yoga.

19:41.070 --> 19:46.579
You must wear my badges, you must wear my rings, you must wear my necklaces

19:46.579 --> 19:52.951
so that people ask you “Who is this?” Then you should say, “She is the Holy Ghost”.

19:52.951 --> 19:56.306
You can say, "We think she is the Holy Ghost".

19:56.306 --> 19:58.612
Let us see what happens.

20:02.212 --> 20:06.729
So, it’s a serious thing that I felt that I have to talk to you

20:06.729 --> 20:13.132
and that we have to be very, very careful about how we look at ourselves.

20:13.132 --> 20:17.431
We have to be aware, we have to be aware about ourselves and what is happening.

20:17.431 --> 20:21.275
I’ve been telling you this many a times, we have to be aware as to what we are

20:21.275 --> 20:22.410
and what is happening.

20:22.410 --> 20:28.829
But if your jobs are important, everything else is important how are you going to work out Sahaja Yoga?

20:30.875 --> 20:34.844
So, there has to be awareness and with your awareness the light will spread.

20:34.844 --> 20:38.214
But it’s not silent, you have to talk about it.

20:40.273 --> 20:45.988
Eloquence is needed, it has to be eloquent, all your light has to talk,

20:45.988 --> 20:52.458
the light has to say, the light has to express and has to
be very confidently done.

20:53.002 --> 21:00.387
Let us see now after going from this tour how far people establish new things.

21:00.677 --> 21:07.032
So far, what my own opinion is,  that there are 50% of Sahaja Yogis

21:07.032 --> 21:10.743
in the West are still quite mediocre

21:10.743 --> 21:14.866
and 25% of them are just there to take advantage.

21:14.866 --> 21:18.303
If they can get something free, they would like to do it.

21:18.642 --> 21:20.714
25% people are like that.

21:20.714 --> 21:24.096
It’s very sad but it is so.

21:24.096 --> 21:29.369
But I must say Indians are poor people but
they will not do anything,

21:29.369 --> 21:33.122
they will never take anything free from Me, nothing.

21:33.132 --> 21:35.997
They will not, they are very self-respecting.

21:35.997 --> 21:38.428
And that is what we have to develop, that self-respect.

21:39.252 --> 21:43.963
Like I have seen I had a house in Hounslow, everybody went there and stayed there free.

21:43.963 --> 21:47.536
Now we have a house there in Shuddy Camp where
everybody goes,

21:47.536 --> 21:51.531
who has no job goes and stays there. It’s such a nonsensical thing.

21:51.531 --> 21:56.678
So, I’m even afraid to start any ashram in London because same thing will start.

21:56.678 --> 21:59.834
If they can take advantage they would like to be there.

21:59.834 --> 22:02.545
Even a spoon they would like to carry like that.

22:02.780 --> 22:06.299
It’s a shameless thing for a Sahaja Yogi to behave like that I think.

22:06.449 --> 22:15.259
We have to have full self-respect and we must understand that we have to sacrifice, to do something about it.

22:17.514 --> 22:21.397
Because this is the last leg, I would say, when I will be talking to you about all these things

22:21.397 --> 22:30.368
and in the beautiful atmosphere here on the bank of Krishna river.

22:31.135 --> 22:37.787
We have to understand that the river flows, it makes a sound,

22:37.787 --> 22:41.892
it makes a sound to show that she- it exists.

22:42.810 --> 22:50.130
But we are not only rivers, we are all the mountains, rivers, everything of the universe we are.

22:50.421 --> 22:58.502
And our manifestation is like a big zero as if the Mother Earth has been emptied out.

22:59.512 --> 23:06.675
It is time that we should watch ourselves and see ourselves, what’s wrong with us.

23:06.675 --> 23:08.078
Very important.

23:08.078 --> 23:14.286
I had to say this once again and again,

23:14.286 --> 23:18.124
but I don’t like to say these things because I love you so much

23:18.124 --> 23:22.005
and I care for you so much and you people also love Me.

23:22.005 --> 23:26.105
But loving Me is not sufficient, you have to love yourself and respect yourself.

23:26.387 --> 23:28.786
Only your Self is going to work out.

23:29.021 --> 23:32.620
As Shivaji Maharaj said, "Swa-dharma rajya"

23:32.620 --> 23:37.875
"You must develop the religion of your Spirit".

23:38.166 --> 23:43.068
That’s what we have to do, is to develop the religion of our Spirit.

23:43.068 --> 23:52.443
And once it happens, we can get the whole world completely emancipated.

23:52.443 --> 23:59.145
This is our work and if we fail then it is the responsibility of Sahaja Yogis and nobody else

23:59.145 --> 24:06.075
So, for everyone I have to tell you that I don’t have to please you, you have to please me.

24:09.042 --> 24:15.042
For a small thing people react, for a small thing they feel bad.

24:15.042 --> 24:18.851
If I don’t smile at somebody they feel bad.

24:18.851 --> 24:22.538
In little, little things they feel bad and they react.

24:22.538 --> 24:25.014
If I say anything, they react.

24:25.014 --> 24:27.244
So how can anything go into you?

24:27.367 --> 24:31.587
If it is such a convexity, how will you absorb it?

24:31.587 --> 24:38.115
It is important that we should try to absorb
with humility, with understanding.

24:38.115 --> 24:41.429
Now you are Sahaja Yogis, you know I am Adi Shakti,

24:41.429 --> 24:44.354
you have had photographs, you have known that I am Adi Shakti.

24:44.354 --> 24:46.502
But how much are we absorbing?

24:46.502 --> 24:48.500
How much we are taking within ourselves?

24:48.500 --> 24:53.252
This work is much more than any one of the incarnations had to do.

24:53.252 --> 24:58.119
It's much more than Christ, is much more than Rama, much more than Shri Krishna’s.

24:58.550 --> 25:02.535
So create such great people among you.

25:02.535 --> 25:08.559
Because I have the power, only thing, you have to have the absorption power,

25:08.559 --> 25:10.235
the acceptability.

25:10.235 --> 25:16.066
But if you run after something very cheapish and something very frivolous, it’s impossible.

25:16.889 --> 25:25.596
You have to ask for your depth and you have to take in, whatever is emitting from my being.

25:25.596 --> 25:29.031
I hope now you all will take it up seriously.

25:29.031 --> 25:32.321
Do your meditation every morning whatever maybe the time.

25:32.321 --> 25:38.882
Every morning we have to do the meditation and we have to see that we finish our work in the night

25:38.882 --> 25:42.230
and then we do little meditation and then sleep off.

25:42.230 --> 25:48.983
Without meditation you cannot grow and that’s why everything doing you have to know that you have to get up in the morning,

25:48.983 --> 25:52.943
do your meditation and then you can take to your work.

25:52.943 --> 25:55.662
Daytime if you want, you can rest for a while.

25:55.662 --> 25:59.770
Now we are in such a place that we have time to rest for a while,

25:59.770 --> 26:02.897
but morning time you have to get up whatever time you sleep.

26:02.897 --> 26:07.264
You have to conquer your sleep a little bit, it gives you lot of lethargy.

26:07.264 --> 26:12.214
Last night I don’t think I slept before 3 o’clock or something like that

26:12.214 --> 26:16.193
and then the whole day I’ve been busy writing reports, this, that.

26:16.366 --> 26:21.946
If I can manage at this age, at your age you should be able to manage something like that.

26:22.097 --> 26:27.148
We have no time to sleep, we have no time to discuss, argue or to eat our food.

26:27.410 --> 26:32.284
We have only time to meditate, that’s all.

26:32.800 --> 26:39.320
I wish all of you absorb my saying and understand it without reacting to it.

26:39.320 --> 26:40.703
Please do not react.

26:40.703 --> 26:43.531
Don’t think, "Mother is trying to chastise you". No.

26:43.531 --> 26:48.792
I’m trying to help you to grow, this is the way you grow sometimes very fast.

26:48.792 --> 26:52.476
So it’s just your growth I am worried about and nothing else.

26:52.476 --> 26:53.895
May God bless you all.

26:53.895 --> 26:58.994
I was very happy the way you were singing all the songs and the way you expressed yourselves.
