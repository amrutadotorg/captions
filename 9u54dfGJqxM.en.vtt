00:13.996 --> 00:19.953
And also the idea is to give more
encouragement to handicrafts and to art.

00:20.154 --> 00:25.468
Because so many times I have told
that a little of clay you can take,

00:25.669 --> 00:30.149
and make it into a beautiful thing which
is worth such a lot;

00:30.350 --> 00:32.286
so why should we exhaust this Mother Earth?

00:32.487 --> 00:36.169
Why not we have few artistic nice things,

00:36.370 --> 00:39.824
instead of having so many things?

00:40.025 --> 00:42.799
But if you go in the shops now you don’t
get anything.

00:43.000 --> 00:46.560
You don’t get silk, you cannot get this,
you cannot get that.

00:46.761 --> 00:49.424
So difficult to get anything natural,

00:49.625 --> 00:54.366
because people have only making
unnatural things.

00:54.567 --> 00:59.021
Whatever it is, in that also you should
create beauty.

00:59.222 --> 01:02.566
If you start creating beauty then
we’ll try to preserve it

01:02.767 --> 01:05.421
and use it sparingly, instead of having

01:05.622 --> 01:09.799
thousands of nonsensical things,
everything disposable.

01:10.000 --> 01:14.723
After some time, we’ll have to have human
beings who are disposable,

01:14.924 --> 01:17.720
we’ll have to dispose them off, how will
they live on this Earth,

01:17.921 --> 01:26.120
if we do not understand that we have
to live on this Earth with its limitations?

01:26.321 --> 01:30.493
So I’ve been telling you many times,
take to artistic things,

01:30.694 --> 01:37.146
take to handmade things, more to handmade;
don’t go too much to this.

01:37.347 --> 01:44.122
At least even if you have to buy something
which is, say, artificial,

01:44.323 --> 01:48.620
at least see to it that it is artistic.

01:54.420 --> 02:00.079
So the – once you have a great desire:

02:00.280 --> 02:03.659
today is the day they want in the whole
world to pray

02:03.860 --> 02:07.917
for the preservation of Mother Earth.
That’s why I started this topic,

02:08.118 --> 02:11.718
that we should pray that we all should
develop art,

02:11.919 --> 02:15.678
develop for ourselves, give as presents
to others,

02:15.879 --> 02:21.290
and also to use artistic things made
of artists.

02:21.491 --> 02:29.734
We can have few things, but artistic,
which expresses art –

02:31.320 --> 02:37.094
not cheap things. In the whole of France

02:37.295 --> 02:42.511
what I saw was that into everything
this plastics has crept in,

02:42.712 --> 02:47.872
whether it is cotton, whether it is silk,
whether it is wool.

02:48.073 --> 02:56.715
It can enter into everywhere, except for
the brains of human beings. It’s horrible.

02:56.916 --> 03:06.677
So whatever it is, in that also see
that you buy artistic things,

03:06.878 --> 03:13.056
not plain, horrible, cheap things.

03:13.225 --> 03:17.129
All right? So this is what we have
to today.

03:17.330 --> 03:21.482
Also, you have to pray to Me when
you are doing puja that,

03:21.683 --> 03:28.994
“Oh, Mother, please save our Earth,
and give people wisdom

03:29.195 --> 03:33.746
that they should behave themselves, and
they should be conscious.”

03:33.947 --> 03:37.544
And every Sahaja Yogi should be conscious

03:37.745 --> 03:41.552
about how much energy he’s using
of electricity,

03:41.753 --> 03:48.218
of telephones or of water, or of anything.

03:48.777 --> 03:50.953
We have to be frugal about it.

03:51.154 --> 03:55.017
If we do not take the responsibility
of these things,

03:55.218 --> 04:00.992
then it will not penetrate anywhere else.
It is for you to do it.

04:03.420 --> 04:10.085
You have to take it up in your everyday
life as a part and parcel of your life,

04:10.289 --> 04:15.547
that you try to save the energy of this
Mother Earth.

04:15.748 --> 04:18.828
It’s very important.
