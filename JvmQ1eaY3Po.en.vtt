00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.520
Okay, I'm just like... There we are. Now we are recording.

2
00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:16.480
Okay, so hello everyone. What a wonderful idea to have a topic like talking about the saris

3
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:22.960
and also the relationship with the saris and Shrimata Jhida. I'm sure there's many,

4
00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:34.720
many stories about it and they're all diverse and beautiful. So my story starts in 1980

5
00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:45.280
when I was still in Switzerland and we had started to organize programs of sajaja yoga.

6
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:52.320
And actually, that was the second time we organized some program in Geneva

7
00:00:53.520 --> 00:01:01.280
for sajaja yoga. And I was the one who actually set them up in the hotel intercontinental.

8
00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:08.800
And I had invited... Can you hear me all? Because I have just a dark screen in front of me.

9
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.040
I can certainly hear you.

10
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.540
Yes.

11
00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:18.980
Yeah, okay then. So I had invited a lot of people, some colleagues, some teachers

12
00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:28.500
at the university where I was teaching and quite a lot of my friends came. And it was just a lovely

13
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:37.300
program. Shrimata Jhida was very humorous. And for instance, there was one friend of mine who

14
00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:44.500
was a banker and he couldn't feel the vibrations. So Shrimata Jhida asked him to say,

15
00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:52.980
mother, are you the banker of all the bankers? And then lo and behold, he felt the vibrations.

16
00:01:53.540 --> 00:02:00.260
And everybody laughed, of course, because it was really funny and very nice, very lighthearted.

17
00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:09.620
Okay, that was at that program. After this program, Shrimata Jhida told a little group to go

18
00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:17.300
to the place, to a place of one young geek called Matthias and to gather there. And so

19
00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:25.380
a little group went there. It was a small apartment in the old town of Geneva. And we all

20
00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:32.020
gathered up there. I mean, I think we were about six or seven, not more than that. And one of my

21
00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:40.660
friends actually attended and she came. And she couldn't feel the vibrations really. And she was

22
00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:50.420
really wondering who Shrimata Jhida was. In the first place, Shrimata Jhida told us that she was

23
00:02:50.420 --> 00:03:00.420
very happy with the program. And then she gave me a beautiful sari, which I show you here. It was

24
00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:08.260
one of hers, actually, one of her saris. And the lila is incredible because this is my favorite

25
00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:15.620
color. It's Indian pink, and it's completely interwoven. I don't know if you can see this.

26
00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:26.900
It's not only plain. You can see a complete thread. Yeah, the weave is beautiful.

27
00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:35.700
And so I had it on my lap, and just a bit casually on my lap, but it was fine.

28
00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:44.820
And then this friend asked Shrimata Jhida if she was a prophet. Shrimata Jhida smiled.

29
00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:52.340
She still couldn't feel the vibrations. So I had the idea to tell her,

30
00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:58.020
why don't you put your hands toward the sari that Shrimata Jhida just gave me?

31
00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:06.500
And lo and behold, she felt tremendous vibrations coming from the sari.

32
00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:15.220
Maybe she had a little block on the agia because she was coming from a Protestant family. And then,

33
00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:26.100
of course, the Virgin Mary and female deities were not really so much worshipped in Protestant Church.

34
00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:34.900
However, she felt such strong vibrations that Shrimata Jhida asked my brother Gregoire to read

35
00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:43.540
the stances of the Devi Mahatmya. And then this friend went into a very deep meditation.

36
00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:49.940
So she was really, and she is, a very ancient soul who was worshipping

37
00:04:50.820 --> 00:05:02.260
the mother goddess, kind of Devi Durga. So that's one part of the story. Fast forward,

38
00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:14.980
in 1988, I was sent to Colombia. I was living at Church Amrud with all my family and my children.

39
00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:22.660
And I had three babies and we were looking after the ashram with another new guinea. I was very

40
00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:29.940
busy, of course, you can imagine, with three little ones. And Shrimata Jhida wanted to give me

41
00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:40.260
a little vacation. And she sent me, she was also going actually to Colombia, where one of my friends

42
00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:47.060
was actually preparing programs for Shrimata Jhida in Bogota, my friend Brigitte, actually.

43
00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:54.980
So we all stayed in her apartment in Bogota. And I was there. It was wonderful because we were

44
00:05:54.980 --> 00:06:01.940
cooking for Shrimata Jhida and we were a little committee and we were preparing these programs.

45
00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:08.980
I mean, I was not especially preparing them, they were already prepared. And lots of people

46
00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:16.020
actually came, thousand people came to these first programs in Bogota. But what I remember

47
00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:23.540
was the puja, which was in her garden, in Brigitte's garden, and Shrimata Jhida was there,

48
00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:32.500
obviously. And I don't remember which puja it was, but it was, we were about a group of like 40 or

49
00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:41.780
50 people. And all the ladies at the end of the puja wanted to ask a name to Shrimata Jhida.

50
00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:47.940
And I said, Oh my God, that would be really nice. I'm also going to queue and I want to have a name

51
00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:58.900
for, from Shrimata Jhida. And I was wearing this sari that she had given me. So I queued and I was

52
00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:06.180
at the end of the queue actually. And when I arrived where she was sitting still on her chair

53
00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:12.660
after the puja, she asked me, Oh, Antoinette, you also want a name? I said, Oh yes, Shrimata

54
00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:22.580
Jhida, I would love a name if you could give me a name. And she was just reflecting a little moment

55
00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:29.140
or in meditation for a moment. And she said Amruta, which I love. So she gave me the name

56
00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:36.580
of Amruta. And then she said, what an amazing, what a beautiful sari you are wearing. Where did

57
00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:43.780
you get this sari? One doesn't do this saris anymore. They are very old kind of fashion saris.

58
00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:52.420
And I said to Shrimata Jhida, Shrimata Jhida, you gave it to me 10 years ago. And so she laughed

59
00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:58.340
and I laughed. And there's a photo of it that I think, Caroline, you can show it. I don't know

60
00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:10.180
where you have it now. I sent it to you yesterday. Yeah. So she was touching the fabric exactly. So

61
00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:18.820
this is Shrimata Jhida taking the fabric into her hands and looking at it and saying, Oh,

62
00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:24.420
we don't, this is Brigitte actually, by the way, kneeling there. And she said,

63
00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:32.180
we don't do this saris anymore. And so it was a lovely story. That's it. That's my story.

64
00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:38.180
I thought you said originally you have three stories.

65
00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:45.620
Sorry, I can't hear you now. I thought you said originally that you have three stories.

66
00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:54.500
Three stories. Well, I can have a small, small other story. That's two. And the other story

67
00:08:54.500 --> 00:09:01.220
that Shrimata Jhida used to choose all our cotton saris when we arrived in India.

68
00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:10.500
And it was always unusual colors. But then when we were wearing them, it was a color,

69
00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:18.340
the unusual color that maybe we wouldn't have worn because we didn't kind of like the color

70
00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:24.500
or something. And then we would wear that sari and it would be amazing. It was a color actually,

71
00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:33.460
which would suit you perfectly. So I don't have a picture of that. But I remember a purple sari,

72
00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:42.260
dark purple cotton sari. I never wear purple, but I put it on and it was beautiful. And another one

73
00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:48.660
which was really a deep green and I don't wear deep green color. And again, it was, I mean,

74
00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:55.940
I have a photo but I didn't send it, this one. And then again, it was a lovely color on me.

75
00:09:57.060 --> 00:10:01.700
And this cotton saris, I mean, I still have some because they are for me, they are

76
00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:11.380
just such a beautiful memory of this kind of India tour, which were in the early 80s. I mean,

77
00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:19.140
yes, we could talk about it for ages. So that's my third story, Caroline. But I'm talking to a

78
00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:24.340
screen and I would love to talk to people, that would be so much nicer if I could see people,

79
00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:31.780
is it not possible? Well, the thing is, Antoinette, that if everybody comes on, then it's kind of

80
00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:37.300
more difficult for the recording. It's easier for the recording if people's cameras are off.

81
00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:44.820
And there's a risk of strange camera angles or people not really recording.

82
00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:51.460
All right. Yeah. All right. Did you hear me all right? Did you hear what I said?

83
00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:58.500
Well, I mean, everybody can learn. By all means, open your cameras for a moment and tell Antoinette

84
00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:03.860
and you thought of her story. It was wonderful. Okay. You heard what I said. Great.

85
00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:04.660
I heard everything.

86
00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:08.020
Okay. And the others as well, hopefully.

87
00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:10.680
Yes.

88
00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:16.580
Okay, great. So that's me. That was my story. It's a lovely story.

89
00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:20.180
Okay, Fergie, don't go away because you're up next.

90
00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:22.180
Okay.

91
00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:39.780
Fergie, can you come back?

92
00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:49.460
Oh, great. Thank you to say that. You could see the pattern. I'm so happy

93
00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:54.580
that you could see the weaving of the sari. Lovely.

94
00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:00.500
Okay, there it is. As soon as you talk, it should switch to you, I think.

95
00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:07.220
Well, let me think.

96
00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:13.460
Would you like me to share the photo?

97
00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:15.220
Yes, please.

98
00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:43.540
So this is a photo of Srimataji and I'm hoping it's the right one. She had a house in...

99
00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:50.500
There was two houses in Hounslow, but this is the one which Vicky and Ian Lewis and

100
00:12:50.500 --> 00:13:00.740
Anne Lewis had bought. And she was packing away her asaris into a trunk. And I was in the house

101
00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:07.460
moving things around. And then she saw me. And not many people know that when you're in Srimati's

102
00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:13.460
presence, you read your mind. And I was wondering what was happening because it didn't seem like

103
00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:21.620
packing away. And then she said to me that the reason why she was going to pack away her asaris

104
00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:30.420
and lock them up in the case, because she said if any of her relatives or anybody tries to

105
00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:37.380
use them or touch them, it wouldn't be good. So she was doing that to protect them.

106
00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:42.740
So that's just my story.

107
00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:51.620
So I can... If you look closely, Srimati's smiling after the photo has been taken.

108
00:13:52.980 --> 00:14:04.260
She can read and just all knowing. So I would say. That's it.

109
00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:05.620
That's lovely.

110
00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:22.180
So now I have next on my list. I have Maria-Amelia.

111
00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:30.420
Yes, I'm here. Hello, everyone. How are you?

112
00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:39.620
Hello. Can you hear me well? Yes. So can you see me? Yes.

113
00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:45.860
So I have three short stories. Well, there are many, but I mean,

114
00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:58.420
just choose, I've chosen just the three first ones. In 1979, 1980, she offered me a sari.

115
00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:09.060
And it was my first sari. And then on my second puja, on my third puja, which was in Zurich in

116
00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:17.060
October 1980, I was trying to get ready because the puja was at our place. I don't know when

117
00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:24.900
mine's in my place. And when you are hosting everyone at your place and the puja and the

118
00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:32.180
cooking. So you can imagine I was a little bit rushing around to get everything done properly

119
00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:39.620
and to get myself ready. And it was the second time I was wearing a sari. I had no clue really

120
00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:48.020
how to put it on. So suddenly she, because she was in our room and then she called me and said,

121
00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:54.980
Mary Amelia, come, come here. And then in two seconds, she just did. And she made the pleats

122
00:15:54.980 --> 00:16:00.740
and it was done. And I had no time to see how it was. She wanted to teach me, but it was so fast

123
00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:12.020
and so perfectly well done. And I couldn't see it. But the sari, I still have it and obviously, and

124
00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:19.060
ever since I've been wearing it in several pujas after I learned how to put them on.

125
00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:30.580
So it's a blue with a red border. Beautiful. So that was the first sari that I had. And she was

126
00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:39.940
the one putting it on me, showing me how to do it. So that's the first story. The second story is

127
00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:49.700
that in before going to India for the first big tour, which was 80, 81, she offered me a sari.

128
00:16:49.700 --> 00:17:01.300
And she said that this sari, she said, well, it's just in silk, but you see, it's quite a nice one

129
00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:12.500
because I did all the drawing and had it printed. So the sari is this. Beautiful. So she had,

130
00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:20.020
she did the drawing. It's just flowers all over. I don't know if you can see 12,

131
00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:28.260
but she was the one who designed it actually and had it printed on silk. So

132
00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:35.940
that was a very, very special thing also. I did not know that we could just, well, that she would

133
00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:42.020
do such a thing. Actually, I have pictures of these saris, but I didn't send them to you,

134
00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:48.260
Caroline. I'm sorry. I didn't think of it, but I can show the albums, but it can be a bit difficult.

135
00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:58.020
But I think the main thing is to have really the sari. Yeah. And the third story is that

136
00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:07.860
it's again a sari that she offered. You see, it was so sweet because at the beginning on those

137
00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:21.780
late 70s, early 80s, we were less people, but she was always offering us and giving us presents and

138
00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:29.620
saris to the ladies. And then she offered me a sari actually for a wedding, not my wedding,

139
00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:36.020
for another wedding. So I had it. And then I went to London in 1981 to attend

140
00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:43.940
the first collective weddings that she gave, not the first, well, but first official because

141
00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:50.100
there were some other weddings first. And in 81, she had 16 couples or 15 couples getting married.

142
00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:56.820
And at the last minute, she had a 16th couple getting remarried because we had been married

143
00:18:56.820 --> 00:19:06.900
before, but not by her. And so she told us to be the 16th couple to be married at that moment.

144
00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:13.860
And of course, as I did not know, because all the other ladies had their saris and chunis and

145
00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:19.380
everything, I didn't know that I was going to be married when I went. So I have taken

146
00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:27.220
this sari because it was a very beautiful one, but that was it. I had no chuni, nothing.

147
00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:34.340
And there was also Hillary who was also getting remarried. There were 14 couples plus two getting

148
00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:41.700
remarried, which made 16. And so at the last minute, she might have asked someone to go to

149
00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:48.340
her house and bring two chunis. She didn't say colors. She didn't say anything. So when the

150
00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:57.700
person came back with the two chunis, one was white and Jill's wedding sari was blue and

151
00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:05.620
embroidered in silver. So it was perfect for her sari. And the other one was pink. And

152
00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:15.940
here is the sari I had. So the two chunis that came were perfect for the saris that we had.

153
00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:22.660
So we could have really the entire time for the wedding. So that's all. Thank you.

154
00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:54.900
Okay. Hello, everyone. This is my first time coming to the early yogis group and I'm

155
00:20:54.900 --> 00:21:01.220
very happy to be here. This is one of my favorite subjects, saris and and Srimati ji. And

156
00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:09.380
so very excited to share with you. I have a lot of stories. I've pared it down. But here's,

157
00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:15.620
I'll begin. So Linda, we still have plenty of time. Yeah, I can do some more later, maybe.

158
00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:24.580
Sure. So I want to begin with my very first India tour. I got my realization actually in London

159
00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:35.460
in 82. I was visiting my sister, you know, Marsha and Danny were there. And then it

160
00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:41.940
it wasn't until 84 that I actually really in earnest started practicing sahaja yoga around June.

161
00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:50.340
And that December, I went to India and arrived there and oh, still kind of wondering, you know,

162
00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:56.820
what is this about and all. So we the tour started in Bombay, and then it went to Vaitarna.

163
00:21:57.540 --> 00:22:04.260
And there we all received our tour sahaja yoga. And I actually have kept these since for the last 40

164
00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:09.060
years. So here's this, this will look familiar to everybody. See, remember these?

165
00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:18.020
So I think every almost everybody got one of these. And again, just like Antoinette was saying,

166
00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:22.900
I mean, I never wore orange, bright orange, you know, never would have worn this color

167
00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:28.420
or combination. But we were given I think seven or eight sahas. And we, that's what we were going

168
00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:34.340
to wear. Here's another one, I never ever would wear yellow. But here's one of those sahas from

169
00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:40.980
one of those early divorce. So remember these styles too. It's really beautiful to remember

170
00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:49.220
them. So, so we've got to Vaitarna. And it was really late, we'd come late on the bus,

171
00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:55.700
and everybody was getting their luggage and getting a place to stay. And my luggage was

172
00:22:55.700 --> 00:23:04.100
nowhere to be found. So I waited and waited and waited. Finally, it was found, but the only place

173
00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:12.660
left to stay was in the same bungalow as Shrimantaji. So there were about, I don't know,

174
00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:20.500
20 of us. And so I, at night, it was very late. And I remember so clearly rolling out my sleeping bag

175
00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:26.020
sitting. And I was literally 20 feet from where Shrimantaji's door was and where she was sleeping,

176
00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:35.380
and I felt very strong pressure. I could clearly feel like her hand, and I knew it was her hand

177
00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:41.540
on my heart, pushing, pushing, pushing. So I just felt like, oh, she's helping me. She's helping me.

178
00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:48.980
Thank you. Thank you. In the morning, when we got up, Shrimantaji came out of the room,

179
00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:57.540
and she, this was the first day, real day of the tour, and she started telling us, now,

180
00:23:57.540 --> 00:24:01.940
I know you all are new to wearing sari, so I'm going to show you how to do it.

181
00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:08.820
So she took a sari, and she, we were all ladies there, of course, so, and she started, she wrapped

182
00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:13.700
it around. She said, first you tie it, you know, wrap it around once, then you bring it around.

183
00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:20.020
And she, that's when she said, it's wrapped in three and a half coils. And she was telling how

184
00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:29.140
auspicious it is and how it's a very dignified and very spiritual thing to wear, to, you know,

185
00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:35.380
encourage us. And she, you know, brought it around and showed very, actually slowly, she showed how

186
00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:44.900
to make the folds, tuck them in, then, you know, bring it around. And then, after she had it over

187
00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:50.500
her shoulder, and then she said, and of course, you'll wear it to puja, you'll wear it, you know,

188
00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:58.100
many, anytime you can wear it. But also, she showed how you can bring it around and tuck it in.

189
00:24:58.820 --> 00:25:04.580
And she said, this way, I remember her going like this, your arms are free, and you can do any work.

190
00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:10.100
So it was such a moment where she said, you know, some people say that when you're wearing a saree,

191
00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:15.860
you have to be so dainty and can't do any work. But no, you can do anything in a saree, and even

192
00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:22.020
you can be a warrior in a saree. I remember her saying that. So that was such an amazing moment,

193
00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:28.420
and I really felt so lucky to have experienced that. And I just want to show you another saree

194
00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:34.980
that I think will be familiar to many of you. Do you remember this one, this pink one? Let me see.

195
00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:45.540
But everybody in the tour got this. Can you see? Yeah, beautiful.

196
00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:52.900
We all got this. It was bright pink, hot pink, which again, for me, was like, really? I'm going

197
00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:59.060
to wear hot pink. But we all, you know, all, however many, 300, or I guess maybe 200 of us

198
00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:03.620
got the same saree. So there was a time when you would go to a puja, and there would be half the

199
00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:13.380
ladies wearing the saree for the puja. So, okay. So then, I actually was so,

200
00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:24.500
I loved going on India tour, and I went every year, starting in 1980, 45. And during those years,

201
00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:31.540
as I was getting established in saaj yoga, and really trying to get cleared out,

202
00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:39.220
there was one year I went, and I really was not in very good shape. And I, you know, was,

203
00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:44.740
had a terrible case of left vishuddhi. And I, at one, it was, again, it was in Vaitarna, actually.

204
00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:53.620
And I was, had this idea in my head, oh, why should I, you know, I was just very, very depressed,

205
00:26:53.620 --> 00:26:59.940
really. And so I was walking along, and it would happen on these tours that all of a sudden,

206
00:27:00.020 --> 00:27:08.020
Shri Mataji would appear. And in this case, she sat down, it was about like 300 yards away from,

207
00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:14.500
200 yards away from where I was. And she, some, you know, yogis were helping her. She put out

208
00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:21.700
a whole lot of sarees in front of her on a cloth. And she, so I went over there, and there was this

209
00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:30.420
big metal fencing there, like a gate, that, that she was on the other side. And I'm looking through

210
00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:36.260
this gate, and I'm looking at these sarees, and, and I'm thinking to myself, why should I even buy

211
00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:41.620
a saree? Because after all, how many pujas am I going to go to? I'm just not going to make it

212
00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:52.100
inside yoga. So, so at that moment, she looked at me, and she called out, and she, she said,

213
00:27:52.100 --> 00:28:03.380
Linda, come buy this saree. And this is the saree that she wanted me to buy. So it's amazing saree,

214
00:28:03.620 --> 00:28:14.100
it's organza. Can you see it? Wow. Wow. It's so, you know, that's the, the edge of it. And then

215
00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:22.980
even the body of it has, can you see that pattern how it is? Yeah. So amazing.

216
00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:27.460
And I, can you all see it? I know it takes a little bit to come and focus, but

217
00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:36.100
yeah, yeah. So this saree I felt like was the saree that saved me and kept me going inside yoga.

218
00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:42.180
I wore it so many times that it actually, you know, organza is pretty light. And so it did rip,

219
00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:47.700
but I recently got somebody to sew it for me. So anyway, this is one of my most precious sarees

220
00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:52.740
that, you know, it's not that, I mean, I bought it, but it really felt that absolutely she gave

221
00:28:52.820 --> 00:29:00.500
it to me. So at that moment of need. The next one I want to tell you is, so

222
00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:10.260
I guess it was in 1990, I was on the tour and I'd come for half the tour and we were in,

223
00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:19.300
help me hear that. What is the, after Brahmapuri where the, where the Mahalakshmi temple is?

224
00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:24.980
Where there's all the shopping and the bangles.

225
00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:37.780
Okay. So, so she much, you know, that would happen that we would all get released into the town to

226
00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:46.260
do some shopping and then she might, so some, this day we heard, you know, around the, the,

227
00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:51.700
the town, somebody said, Oh, she matches. He's here. And I happened to hear where she was. She

228
00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:59.220
was in a saudi shop. So I was with three other ladies and we went to that saudi shop where

229
00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:05.780
somebody told us where she was. And we were standing outside the shop, but not in view.

230
00:30:05.780 --> 00:30:09.860
Like we were on the side of the door because we didn't want to disturb and all. So we were

231
00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:16.420
just standing outside, but to the side, not in the doorway at all. So, and that year I was getting

232
00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:27.220
married. So just as we're standing there, I hear Srimadaji's voice and she says, Linda,

233
00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:38.260
come here and buy your saudi for your wedding. So, so she, she had, she was at the back of the

234
00:30:38.260 --> 00:30:44.260
store. She never came forward, but she, she, this is the saudi. This is my wedding saudi.

235
00:30:46.820 --> 00:30:51.140
I can't see. You cannot see. Okay. Let's see. Is that better?

236
00:30:53.540 --> 00:30:59.860
Wow. I can see it fine. Yeah. It's silver work with, let me show you the other side.

237
00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:03.220
There's a lot of, it's very heavy saudi, you know, it's a wedding saudi.

238
00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:10.580
So it's, you know, red, which is the traditional color. Anyway, I felt so very blessed.

239
00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:16.260
Show us the inside as well. Oh yeah, sure. Let's see. I mean, it looks

240
00:31:18.420 --> 00:31:20.100
like that. Wow.

241
00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:31.940
I think, yeah, that's pretty much the, yeah. Oh my God. I know it's beautiful.

242
00:31:31.940 --> 00:31:43.460
Amazing. Yes. So then, the next one is an embarrassing moment.

243
00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:51.860
So many of these situations are, can be embarrassing. So this was in Kibela in the early

244
00:31:51.860 --> 00:31:57.780
nineties. And I had gone for Krishna Puja. I always would go like a week in advance to prepare and,

245
00:31:57.940 --> 00:32:03.300
she would, you know, we would talk about preparing for the puja. She would give the menus and all

246
00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:13.220
these things. So I was there in the drawing room with not very many other people. And so

247
00:32:13.860 --> 00:32:23.940
as we were sitting there, some yogi arrived with a suitcase. And what they said was that they had

248
00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:35.620
found the suitcase and it was full of saudis that some lady, former yogini, had stolen.

249
00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:43.860
So they had found, they had recovered this suitcase full of saudis. So this was, you know,

250
00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:50.420
Shimachi was happy and they took the saudis into her bedroom. Well, at that point,

251
00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:58.900
I had not yet received a saudi from Shimachi. And I had heard stories about people who had,

252
00:32:58.900 --> 00:33:03.700
and I thought, oh, that would be so nice. You know, this is again, what Fergie was saying.

253
00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:08.100
I didn't know at the time, this is the first time I really understood that she reads every single,

254
00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:13.540
she hears every single thought you have when you're in her presence. And anytime, by the way.

255
00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:22.100
So that is more obvious when you're with her. So there I am thinking, oh, wouldn't it be nice

256
00:33:22.100 --> 00:33:27.940
to get a saudi from Shimachi? So right after I have this thought, she calls one of the yogis,

257
00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:36.980
the yogi disappears into her bedroom and comes out with this saudi. So this saudi is what

258
00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:41.140
must have been from that suitcase, I think. And it's, look at this thing.

259
00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:45.460
Oh my gosh. Wow.

260
00:33:46.820 --> 00:33:49.620
That's just the whole, the whole saudi is this work.

261
00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:57.060
You know, the body of the saudi is that work. And then the, the palu, let me see,

262
00:33:58.740 --> 00:34:00.340
is even more elaborate.

263
00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:10.100
Let's see if I have it ready here. And also as Antoinette was saying, oh yeah, here it is.

264
00:34:11.220 --> 00:34:17.860
The turquoise is my very favorite color. Can you see?

265
00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:18.980
Wow. Yes.

266
00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:28.900
So I was so embarrassed, also so delighted. So this is, and you know, it's the sort of thing that

267
00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:33.540
for so many years, even now, you know, when somebody says, well, if you're,

268
00:34:33.540 --> 00:34:37.620
if you have to leave your house, you know, there's a fire or something you have to leave in a hurry.

269
00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:42.740
What would you bring? And this saudi is one of the things that I have ready to bring.

270
00:34:48.660 --> 00:34:55.620
The next one is, is a story also in Kabbalah.

271
00:34:56.500 --> 00:35:05.780
Came early for, to prepare for puja and Krishna puja. And so there were, I think,

272
00:35:05.780 --> 00:35:13.780
three Indian ladies plus me who were there. And so, so, Srimadji, this is before the puja,

273
00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:20.420
Srimadji gave saudis to each of us. And so they got these very heavy embroidered, you know,

274
00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:27.460
sarees, puja type saudis. And I got this one, which is again, my favorite color.

275
00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:33.780
Oh, sorry. Turquoise and it's this very lightweight material. Can you see?

276
00:35:36.340 --> 00:35:37.140
Yeah, lovely.

277
00:35:37.860 --> 00:35:43.940
Yeah. And it's very light and it's got a sort of, oh, the rest of it has, it's all this kind of

278
00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:52.740
checkered, but simple, but so bright. And this color, I mean, you can see it, it just,

279
00:35:52.740 --> 00:35:58.660
when I wear it, I feel really like completely, you know, my best self or something. So,

280
00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:04.740
so I would love the saudi. But then when we got back to the room we were staying in,

281
00:36:05.540 --> 00:36:12.420
the other lady said, well, they looked at my saudi and they said, that's not silk. So I thought, oh,

282
00:36:13.220 --> 00:36:16.660
I got, you know, they got, they clearly got silk saudis and I thought, oh,

283
00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:25.780
my saudi is not silk. Oh. So the next day we went to, we went into Srimadji's drawing room.

284
00:36:26.660 --> 00:36:31.060
Well, we were about to, and just, you know, going from the dining room there into the drawing room,

285
00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:39.140
just as I'm walking in, Srimadji says, this is so embarrassing, she shouts out to me,

286
00:36:39.140 --> 00:36:52.500
she stopped doing what she's doing. And she says, it is silk.

287
00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:07.700
Yeah. So maybe I'll tell you another similar story, actually, before I get to,

288
00:37:08.660 --> 00:37:16.820
this one, this one. So this is another sort of story on me, where this was an Adi Shakti

289
00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:23.460
puja in Ganujahari and she was giving saudis to the ladies, puja saudis, who had helped organize

290
00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:30.180
the puja. So when I came up, I, you know, you're standing in line and you're seeing how she's,

291
00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:36.260
Srimadji's sitting on the stage. And then there's, you know, there was one lady who was distributing

292
00:37:36.260 --> 00:37:40.820
the saudis, just picking up a saudi and giving it to the next lady, picking up a saudi and giving

293
00:37:40.820 --> 00:37:49.220
it to the next lady. So as I'm getting closer, I, you know, you already saw, I had that pink saudi

294
00:37:49.220 --> 00:37:56.100
from, you know, 20 years before, but I didn't have a heavy pink saudi. And I made the mistake

295
00:37:56.100 --> 00:38:01.300
of just having the thought, oh, wouldn't it be nice to have a heavy pink saudi?

296
00:38:02.020 --> 00:38:10.500
So, so as I get there to receive my saudi, Srimadji, again, was doing something. She stopped

297
00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:16.020
what she was doing. She turns to the lady who's giving out the saudis and she said, who's already

298
00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:21.460
taken one in her hand. She says, no, not that one. Give her that one. This is the one.

299
00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:30.180
So I, she gave me a pink saudi because she knows that I wanted. Yeah. This,

300
00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:33.380
so you can see it's very, very pink here.

301
00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:37.620
Gorgeous. Yeah.

302
00:38:43.060 --> 00:38:51.220
So, okay. Then, maybe, let's see, maybe the last one I'll tell you about is the one I'm wearing.

303
00:38:51.860 --> 00:38:54.820
And this one is, it was again,

304
00:38:57.460 --> 00:39:00.500
a puja where she was giving saudis to all the ladies. And

305
00:39:03.140 --> 00:39:11.700
so when I came up to receive a saudi from her, she, she motioned to someone to do a certain

306
00:39:11.700 --> 00:39:17.060
saudi that was on the side. So, and she, she brought that, and I mean, they brought that,

307
00:39:17.060 --> 00:39:21.940
and she said, this is special for you to me. And she gave it to me. And this, if you can see,

308
00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:28.100
if I can make it more, yeah, I have to stand up. So this one has, this was in the early 90s,

309
00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:34.340
or mid to early 90s. So you can see, it has scenes from Sri Krishna's life. It has

310
00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:40.100
getting the, stealing the butter, and it has

311
00:39:40.100 --> 00:39:49.540
chasing Krishna. So it's got all these scenes, and she, she, she opened it, and she said, see,

312
00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:56.580
you can see that Sri Krishna's stories on it. So that was, this is also to me, one of my most

313
00:39:58.180 --> 00:40:02.500
treasured ones. So that's all for now.

314
00:40:04.900 --> 00:40:09.460
Beautiful. Wow. That, I've asked if you have 108 songs.

315
00:40:10.100 --> 00:40:19.460
And she said, can you hear me, Hinda? Not very well. What did you say?

316
00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:26.420
I said, Dara, I wondered if you have 108 saris. I don't know. I probably have around 50 though.

317
00:40:27.540 --> 00:40:31.380
And she said, also perhaps some of the saris worn by Drakadi,

318
00:40:31.940 --> 00:40:35.460
Jewish Mother protects the chastity of the US through your collection.

319
00:40:35.940 --> 00:40:44.500
Yeah. Beautiful, beautiful stories. Thank you for the opportunity to share them.

320
00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:57.700
And Felicity? Yes. Yes, I'm here. Just one minute. Yes, I'm here. Right. I'm here. But I don't think

321
00:40:57.700 --> 00:41:07.220
I'm spotlighted. Yes, you are. Well, I can only see black on my screen. Really? Well, I can see

322
00:41:07.220 --> 00:41:16.580
you. Okay. Okay. I'll just see black. That's okay. All right. So Jai Sharmataji everybody,

323
00:41:17.140 --> 00:41:23.300
how lovely to share all the wonderful stories and what a beautiful collection everybody has.

324
00:41:24.100 --> 00:41:30.260
So I have, I don't know if we have time. I have a small story and a longer sort of miracle story.

325
00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:39.780
We have time. All right. So I will start with the first story. So in the early pujas,

326
00:41:39.780 --> 00:41:47.460
the early days, often the ladies would be asked to share saris to decorate.

327
00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:56.340
And one particular occasion, we were in San Diego, having Sri Buddha pujas on the beach,

328
00:41:56.340 --> 00:42:03.220
on the sand, literally under a tent on the beach. There must have been, I think this was

329
00:42:06.820 --> 00:42:13.220
87, 88 Sri Buddha pujas. And there's a lovely, if you watch the pujas itself,

330
00:42:13.220 --> 00:42:23.300
it's a beautiful talk and they made a backdrop of the big banyan tree that Sri Buddha was said to

331
00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:31.300
have got his enlightenment, his realization under it. And so we had the stage set up and then there

332
00:42:31.300 --> 00:42:36.980
was this backdrop of this, actually it wasn't even painted. I think they'd, they somehow made it out

333
00:42:36.980 --> 00:42:45.380
of cardboard or it's something was like a 3D big tree with branches. And this call went,

334
00:42:45.380 --> 00:42:52.820
and we were all sleeping. We were all staying in tents on this sandy, very hot beach. And

335
00:42:53.700 --> 00:43:00.740
I had two small children at the time and I had only brought, I think my pujasari and maybe one

336
00:43:00.740 --> 00:43:09.140
other extra sari in case of need. And this call went out, we need saris to decorate the stage.

337
00:43:09.140 --> 00:43:16.660
Can the Laxmis come forward and share their saris? And I thought, oh, this is such a special,

338
00:43:17.460 --> 00:43:26.340
auspicious offering to have your sari used to decorate the stage for the pujas. It will

339
00:43:26.580 --> 00:43:32.340
imbibe all these beautiful vibrations that mother will be emitting through the pujas.

340
00:43:32.340 --> 00:43:37.940
But I didn't have, and many ladies came forward and they had embroidered silk saris.

341
00:43:37.940 --> 00:43:47.700
And what I had brought was this very simple silk sari, which I had bought on my first India tour in

342
00:43:48.260 --> 00:43:56.260
82. So it's very lovely, soft, light silk, but it's not fancy in any way. But I thought,

343
00:43:56.900 --> 00:44:02.740
okay, nevermind. I'll just, you know, it's okay. Maybe they'll use it. Maybe they need it. Who

344
00:44:02.740 --> 00:44:08.740
knows? So I'll just, you know, I'll offer this one. So I'll just keep it still. Sorry. So you can

345
00:44:08.980 --> 00:44:17.380
see the pattern. And so I surrendered the sari. We went ahead and we had pujas.

346
00:44:18.020 --> 00:44:26.420
And at some point I think I must've thought, I don't remember when it might've been at the end,

347
00:44:26.820 --> 00:44:36.020
when the pujas was over and they started taking down the saris. And they just before that,

348
00:44:36.820 --> 00:44:42.020
and they said, please come and collect your sari. And as I went forward, I looked and I thought,

349
00:44:42.020 --> 00:44:49.380
oh, I don't see my sari. It's not in the backdrop. It's not been used. That's okay. It doesn't

350
00:44:49.380 --> 00:44:54.820
matter. That's okay. It was nice that I offered. And as I was up near the front and I said,

351
00:44:54.820 --> 00:45:00.500
someone said, oh, you have a sari. And I said, yes, I gave a sari, but I don't see it being used.

352
00:45:00.500 --> 00:45:07.220
And she said, can you describe it? And I did. And she said, oh yes, we use the sari. We wrapped the

353
00:45:07.220 --> 00:45:16.740
cushion under mother's feet. I just went, oh, I just could not believe it. And I went, oh my

354
00:45:16.740 --> 00:45:24.180
goodness, what a blessing mother. That was so, so kind. And so ever since I never wore this sari

355
00:45:24.180 --> 00:45:31.460
again, and I have just kept it in a bag in my drawer and every so often I get it out and I just,

356
00:45:31.460 --> 00:45:40.100
I lay my head, I lay my head on it. And to my mind, it not mind it's when I just did it just

357
00:45:40.100 --> 00:45:46.580
now when I got it out and I was just bowing on it. And it seemed to me that I smelled the fragrance

358
00:45:46.580 --> 00:45:54.180
of shamataji. I can't explain it. So, so this sari is very special to me. And I feel that was

359
00:45:54.180 --> 00:46:04.900
a very special gift from shamataji for me. So that's that story. And so then I have one other

360
00:46:04.900 --> 00:46:11.300
story. I actually have shared my wedding sari story, which was quite a sort of funny story in

361
00:46:11.300 --> 00:46:19.140
another video. So I thought I wouldn't share that today, but I have this miracle story and I have to,

362
00:46:19.140 --> 00:46:29.700
I will explain. So in the summer of, I guess, or fall of 2009, eight, eight, my eldest daughter

363
00:46:29.700 --> 00:46:34.020
said to me, mom, I'm putting my name down. I'm going to go and get married in India.

364
00:46:34.020 --> 00:46:41.460
And I went, that's wonderful. Great. And so some, after some time I suddenly had

365
00:46:42.260 --> 00:46:49.780
such a strong feeling. I felt I have to have a new sari for this, my, you know, she's getting married

366
00:46:49.780 --> 00:46:57.220
and I can't explain it. It wasn't a desire. We didn't have money to buy a special sari,

367
00:46:57.220 --> 00:47:02.580
but it's fine. I it's like, I felt mother telling me you have to get a new sari for this,

368
00:47:02.580 --> 00:47:08.020
for this wedding occasion. And I saw, and you can't wear your wedding. Sorry. It has to be a new

369
00:47:09.220 --> 00:47:15.140
side. And I thought, what am I going to do? I'm going to be the mother standing there. I need to

370
00:47:15.140 --> 00:47:21.060
have a sort of like a decent sari looking. It has to be some kind of embroidered silk sari. And I

371
00:47:21.060 --> 00:47:26.660
didn't have anything other than my wedding sari. And we certainly didn't have money to buy one.

372
00:47:26.660 --> 00:47:32.260
And I thought, all right, I'll just go look in my closet and see what's there. So I go and I

373
00:47:32.500 --> 00:47:39.060
open the doors to my closet and I'm looking at the sari set. And suddenly I see this red sari

374
00:47:39.620 --> 00:47:48.580
with gold embroidery, like a wedding sari, which I will show you. So it's this one. And actually,

375
00:47:48.580 --> 00:47:55.780
if I can open it up, it does have a very nice border in it. It's just got covered over. Yes,

376
00:47:55.780 --> 00:48:07.380
here we go. So it has, can you see? Yeah. So it has a special standard and you can see it's got

377
00:48:07.380 --> 00:48:13.540
beautiful. This is the inside. You can see all the gold thread. So this is just an amazing sari.

378
00:48:13.540 --> 00:48:19.140
And I thought, what's this sari doing here? How can this be here? And then I felt, Oh, this must

379
00:48:19.140 --> 00:48:25.060
be Brigitte Sagstadt. They were staying with us and then they packed up and moved country to Austria.

380
00:48:25.060 --> 00:48:31.620
I thought somehow, somehow I have no idea how it's got left and put in my cupboard. So I rang her

381
00:48:31.620 --> 00:48:38.420
up and I said, Oh, Brigitte, I found this sari in the cupboard and Freya is going to get married.

382
00:48:38.420 --> 00:48:46.580
And I feel like I feel mother telling me that I need to wear a special sari for the wedding.

383
00:48:46.580 --> 00:48:53.380
I wondered, could I borrow your sari? And she said to me, it's not my sari. I have all my saris here.

384
00:48:55.060 --> 00:49:06.740
So I just went. I have no idea how mother did that. Nobody came to visit us. We lived in a

385
00:49:06.740 --> 00:49:16.180
forest far from the collective. This is my miracle sari that Srimadaji put into my wardrobe.

386
00:49:16.180 --> 00:49:23.140
Don't ask me how, but mother works miracles. So then the follow-up to this is we went to India

387
00:49:23.140 --> 00:49:30.500
and my daughter was matched to an Indian. And I felt, Oh, on the day of the start of the ceremony,

388
00:49:30.500 --> 00:49:37.620
I felt I have to look perfect. So I, I don't, you know, I usually try to look nice, but this time I

389
00:49:37.620 --> 00:49:43.700
really paid attention to the detail. I put the sari on, I made sure the pleats were perfect.

390
00:49:43.700 --> 00:49:50.180
Everything looked really fine. I asked someone, I said to them, I have to look good. I don't know

391
00:49:50.180 --> 00:49:56.500
why, but I have to look good. Do I look good? And she said, yes, you look, you look perfect. You look,

392
00:49:56.500 --> 00:50:04.500
you know, dignified and beautiful in the sari. So then we are standing by the fireplace waiting.

393
00:50:04.500 --> 00:50:12.260
I'm standing with my daughter. And it, for some reason at that time, the group, the bride was

394
00:50:12.260 --> 00:50:22.500
to the brides and her family were waiting by the fire and the groom and his family came into the

395
00:50:22.500 --> 00:50:30.340
pendant afterwards. So we're waiting for the grooms to come. And finally the room start entering the

396
00:50:30.340 --> 00:50:37.540
pendant and I see them getting closer and then I see, Oh, there he is. And there's his mommy and

397
00:50:37.540 --> 00:50:42.260
his daddy. And I don't think for whatever reason I'd met them before it was all quite quick, you

398
00:50:42.260 --> 00:50:48.900
know, you get matched and then a day or two later you're married. And I watched as she came towards

399
00:50:48.900 --> 00:50:56.580
us, his mother and she turned and she saw me and she looked at me and I saw her whole face beam.

400
00:50:56.580 --> 00:51:05.300
And she just went like, Oh, she looks wonderful. And I felt, I felt in that moment that it was

401
00:51:05.300 --> 00:51:12.580
important for me to show that I understood their culture, that we had respect. I could wear the

402
00:51:12.580 --> 00:51:20.500
sari and that in some way, this was reflecting on my daughter, that this was giving her dignity and

403
00:51:20.500 --> 00:51:26.900
status in their eyes because their son was marrying a Westerner born realized I'll be it,

404
00:51:26.900 --> 00:51:34.500
but a Westerner. And I realized in that moment, this is why I had to have this sari. It wasn't

405
00:51:34.500 --> 00:51:41.620
for me. It was actually for my daughter. It was for Shreya. So that is the story of my miracle

406
00:51:41.620 --> 00:51:49.220
story, how it is so beautiful. Her mother takes care of us in so many small ways and ways that

407
00:51:50.660 --> 00:51:56.420
we don't understand the bigger picture. We don't know why, but we just follow our heart. We follow

408
00:51:56.420 --> 00:52:04.740
what we feel mother is telling us and we then reap the beautiful rewards. So Jai Shri Mataji.

409
00:52:04.740 --> 00:52:15.540
Thank you, mother. Nice. That's it from me. I don't have, I think because I went to Canada,

410
00:52:15.540 --> 00:52:22.500
you know, quite soon in 82 and we had a lot of children and I wasn't in a position to help and

411
00:52:23.140 --> 00:52:30.580
be around mother physically. So I didn't really, I received one other sari, a small sari, but

412
00:52:31.460 --> 00:52:35.220
there isn't a story behind that. So Jai Shri Mataji.

413
00:52:37.540 --> 00:52:41.060
What an amazing story to finish on for this. That's so beautiful.

414
00:52:42.020 --> 00:52:48.100
