00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:07.360
Christmas Puja December 25, 2002

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:11.127
Ganapatipule India

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:23.480
Merry Christmas to you all!

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:28.280
According to Sahaja Yoga,

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:35.480
Christ is settled on your Agnya chakra.

00:09:43.547 --> 00:09:49.760
His whole life is depicting

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:58.840
the qualities of a person

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:06.000
who is a realized soul

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:11.386
and what He has suggested

00:10:11.586 --> 00:10:14.632
in His own life is

00:10:14.832 --> 00:10:23.520
that you should not have any greed or lust.

00:10:27.517 --> 00:10:31.040
The way these days people have greedy

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:35.960
all over the world is really shocking.

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:42.800
Right from the childhood,

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:46.840
our children also learned

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:50.920
to ask for this or ask for that.

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:56.680
Only complete satisfaction in life

00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:02.000
can give you that equanimity, that

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:11.880
balance by which you do not hanker after things.

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:20.200
These days even India has become

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:25.520
very much westernised in the sense

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:33.160
they are also very much wanting to have this and that.

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:45.080
Actually, now in America, suddenly with this happening,

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:51.640
people are getting to spirituality.

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:55.800
They come to spirituality

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:02.720
because they think they have not found any satisfaction anywhere.

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:05.920
But we have to see from His life,

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:09.200
the great life of Christ.

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:16.640
First He was born in a small little hut,

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:20.320
as you saw many of them when you come round,

00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:23.200
very much satisfied

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:28.960
and He was put in a cradle,

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:41.040
which was all covered with dry, very dry grass.

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:43.280
Can you imagine?

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:51.160
And then He sacrificed His life on the cross.

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:57.400
Whole thing is a story of a sacrifice

00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:01.400
because He had a power,

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:07.960
power of spirit that He could sacrifice anything.

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:11.440
He even sacrificed His own life.

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:19.200
So you can understand the greatness of Christ

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:28.640
was coming from His great personality of spirituality.

00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:38.760
But the same Christ is worshipped

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:46.360
all over the world, specially in the western countries

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:53.320
and you'll be amazed to know how they're running after things.

00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:57.240
All their industries are running

00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:01.760
with big stories about what they make

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:07.240
and how people boast of their wealth.

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:12.360
They will have a cross

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:16.560
in their necks to show that they are Christians.

00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:19.960
First of all one should never wear that cross

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:23.720
on which Christ was crucified.

00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:29.760
But they do make up by this hypocrisy,

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:36.120
and they are the another extreme of Christ.

00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:43.720
Not only they, but even their wives and their children

00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:47.280
are all very greedy people.

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:51.400
They should have this, they should have that.

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:57.800
But now India is very much in the same run.

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:03.600
And what do they ask for?

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:08.600
They think by getting all these things around them,

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:12.440
they'll be very comfortable. It's not so.

00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:15.880
They're all the time hankering

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:22.040
and they cannot even enjoy whatever they have achieved.

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:25.680
It is something very surprising

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:29.520
that in a country like America,

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:34.720
where there was no corruption,

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:42.040
but there were people who were making big, big, big money,

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:47.160
they are supposed to be disciples of Christ.

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:55.360
It's beyond Me.

00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:59.920
India was once upon a time a real

00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:04.440
saintly country where saints were respected,

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:12.800
but nowadays India has fallen down

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:21.920
to such a low level of greed

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:28.440
that impossible to understand these people.

00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:36.840
We can say they had not such a great following of Christ.

00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:41.960
And those who followed Christ, also the Christians here,

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:44.680
they are the worst.

00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:52.080
They are the ones who have taken to all kinds of western life,

00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:57.720
of greed, and they call themselves Christians.

00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:08.760
But Christ has shown that you don't need anything in this world.

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:16.400
He's such a great personality, such a great incarnation,

00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:21.080
respected all everywhere by,

00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:29.080
because His power of sacrificing was the highest,

00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:38.160
not because He was owning a big car or any big house, nothing,

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:44.320
only because He was such a humble man.

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:50.080
His life is remarkable.

00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:55.840
And that today He governs the hearts of so many,

00:17:56.040 --> 00:18:03.280
despite the fact He was born a very, very poor man

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:09.200
and was crucified also as a very poor man.

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:15.160
So those people who are running after

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:19.680
money are no way Christians,

00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:23.480
are nowhere near Christ.

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:27.880
And so happy and joyous He was.

00:18:28.414 --> 00:18:31.266
And He helped the poor,

00:18:31.466 --> 00:18:34.341
He helped the needy

00:18:34.541 --> 00:18:37.802
because He understood their problems,

00:18:38.002 --> 00:18:41.349
because He could feel them.

00:18:41.549 --> 00:18:47.240
He tried to help all kinds of diseased people,

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:52.731
underprivileged, while today's

00:18:53.261 --> 00:18:56.620
world has come to such a nonsense that they

00:18:56.820 --> 00:18:59.981
help countries to fight.

00:19:00.702 --> 00:19:04.725
They create Christianity to fight.

00:19:04.925 --> 00:19:08.513
What is Christianity doing in this country?

00:19:08.713 --> 00:19:18.153
It's just to create a big power

00:19:19.357 --> 00:19:22.944
of creating lots of Christians.

00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:30.164
I've heard from many places

00:19:30.677 --> 00:19:35.210
how they are converting people to Christianity.

00:19:36.564 --> 00:19:40.910
Christ never converted even a single soul.

00:19:42.464 --> 00:19:45.667
He wanted to give transformation,

00:19:45.867 --> 00:19:48.858
as you all have got it,

00:19:49.491 --> 00:19:53.141
but not changing the religion

00:19:53.341 --> 00:19:59.598
or changing your birthmarks, no.

00:20:00.446 --> 00:20:06.479
And what did He achieve is this kind of a useless

00:20:06.679 --> 00:20:13.999
third rate people who are running after lust and greed.

00:20:15.477 --> 00:20:19.228
I get worried sometimes about Myself,

00:20:19.701 --> 00:20:25.501
that I hope My disciples and My children

00:20:25.701 --> 00:20:30.615
won't do things which are against Sahaj,

00:20:30.815 --> 00:20:36.475
which are against the principle of Sahaj.

00:20:36.675 --> 00:20:40.314
And one of the principle of Sahaj is

00:20:40.514 --> 00:20:47.114
that you have to help people, those who are downtrodden,

00:20:47.593 --> 00:20:50.873
those who are not yet realized.

00:20:51.073 --> 00:20:54.947
You have to give them Realization.

00:20:55.147 --> 00:21:00.712
It is not the way world is going on,

00:21:01.107 --> 00:21:10.267
that we give help to people who are ruining this world.

00:21:11.873 --> 00:21:14.683
If we have to save this country,

00:21:14.883 --> 00:21:17.817
if you have to save the whole world,

00:21:18.017 --> 00:21:21.195
then we have to become like Christ.

00:21:21.395 --> 00:21:25.720
Develop your sacrificing temperament.

00:21:26.044 --> 00:21:29.870
It should be very, very powerful thing

00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:34.361
because you are all realized souls.

00:21:34.908 --> 00:21:40.988
Try to develop that,

00:21:42.497 --> 00:21:46.832
a temperament of helping others.

00:21:47.507 --> 00:21:51.282
I've known some very great people in My life

00:21:51.482 --> 00:21:56.719
who were always willing to give

00:21:57.500 --> 00:22:00.780
to people who haven't got it

00:22:01.306 --> 00:22:06.106
and they have been of such a great

00:22:06.934 --> 00:22:11.648
temperament they were never sort of

00:22:12.114 --> 00:22:16.923
given any big award or anything,

00:22:17.290 --> 00:22:23.157
but very happy if they could help others.

00:22:26.025 --> 00:22:31.617
It's very, very sad today in this country

00:22:31.817 --> 00:22:35.982
where so many people have sacrificed their lives to

00:22:36.182 --> 00:22:39.676
achieve independence and freedom.

00:22:39.876 --> 00:22:43.073
And what is happening is now today,

00:22:43.273 --> 00:22:50.790
same people or may be their children may be, not the same,

00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:53.986
are supposed to be governing,

00:22:54.186 --> 00:22:59.459
supposed to be in charge, are making money.

00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:05.440
Why this situation has come?

00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:08.258
In this country also we had

00:23:08.458 --> 00:23:12.743
many people who were extremely sacrificing.

00:23:12.985 --> 00:23:15.343
They were the leaders.

00:23:15.543 --> 00:23:20.063
But how many of you are like that?

00:23:20.613 --> 00:23:23.682
How many of you would like

00:23:23.882 --> 00:23:27.622
to give away something of yours to others?

00:23:28.416 --> 00:23:33.936
What would you do to help others?

00:23:36.006 --> 00:23:41.125
It's very sad that the Christian nations

00:23:41.325 --> 00:23:48.420
have never followed Christ and we also are becoming the same.

00:23:49.438 --> 00:23:54.362
I don't say that we should not do business

00:23:54.562 --> 00:23:57.457
or we should not make money.

00:23:57.657 --> 00:24:04.397
You can, but with all that you must remember

00:24:04.597 --> 00:24:07.828
for whom are you doing it.

00:24:08.116 --> 00:24:11.516
What are you going to do with it?

00:24:12.169 --> 00:24:16.809
With this money, what are you going to do?

00:24:17.763 --> 00:24:23.829
Actually, we should find out at least in one year

00:24:24.029 --> 00:24:28.925
have we given up one of our things to others.

00:24:29.125 --> 00:24:34.253
Not that I say you crucify yourself, no, that's bit too much,

00:24:34.453 --> 00:24:40.476
but can you at least sacrifice a little bit

00:24:40.676 --> 00:24:44.716
of your comfort for the people?

00:24:47.941 --> 00:24:53.155
Sahaja yogis have to be extremely kind,

00:24:53.355 --> 00:24:57.234
extremely kind and loving people.

00:24:58.196 --> 00:25:01.776
If you are not that, you are not Sahaja yogis.

00:25:01.976 --> 00:25:05.459
First thing, you should be kind and loving

00:25:05.659 --> 00:25:10.846
and understanding the problems around

00:25:11.111 --> 00:25:16.111
and try to help as many people as you can.

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:19.723
But that is not so.

00:25:20.323 --> 00:25:26.509
Even Sahaja yogis do not understand

00:25:26.709 --> 00:25:30.246
what is the value of their life.

00:25:30.446 --> 00:25:33.938
They are on the same path as Christ was.

00:25:34.138 --> 00:25:36.631
They're realized souls.

00:25:36.831 --> 00:25:40.553
They must have that feeling.

00:25:40.753 --> 00:25:46.169
They must have that oneness with the rest of the people

00:25:46.369 --> 00:25:53.895
and they should feel the sacrifice of Christ within themself.

00:25:54.292 --> 00:26:00.706
How He sacrificed His life is to improve our Agnya,

00:26:00.906 --> 00:26:06.234
to remove our ego, to fight our ego.

00:26:06.434 --> 00:26:09.683
But we are so egoistical.

00:26:10.908 --> 00:26:17.866
Whatever He has done is a waste, is something people don't

00:26:18.066 --> 00:26:22.249
understand and they do not imbibe

00:26:22.449 --> 00:26:28.729
His character and His life. It's very bad.

00:26:29.652 --> 00:26:35.748
For us, He's a very great message

00:26:35.948 --> 00:26:39.838
for all the people who are realized souls.

00:26:40.038 --> 00:26:43.745
He's a very great example.

00:26:44.026 --> 00:26:47.746
There are so many things to be done.

00:26:48.431 --> 00:26:57.748
We have, as you know, My mind is always with the needy

00:26:58.082 --> 00:27:02.913
and I've started many such organization.

00:27:03.113 --> 00:27:05.091
You know them very well.

00:27:05.291 --> 00:27:11.193
Recently I started something for the destitute women

00:27:11.393 --> 00:27:15.113
and the orphans in Delhi.

00:27:15.512 --> 00:27:18.105
I paid most of the money

00:27:18.305 --> 00:27:22.665
but, at just the finishing,

00:27:23.454 --> 00:27:26.650
I said "Why not ask Sahaja yogis

00:27:26.850 --> 00:27:30.158
to pay that little money to finish?"

00:27:30.358 --> 00:27:32.822
and they did, they did pay.

00:27:33.022 --> 00:27:37.817
In Delhi, I must congratulate them for showing the way

00:27:38.017 --> 00:27:40.348
to other Sahaja yogis.

00:27:41.451 --> 00:27:46.819
I was amazed how they could raise so much money

00:27:47.299 --> 00:27:52.099
for this big organization.

00:27:54.992 --> 00:27:58.071
It is something we never see,

00:27:58.271 --> 00:28:03.838
how the women are suffering in our country,

00:28:04.666 --> 00:28:07.851
how the destitute women are suffering.

00:28:08.051 --> 00:28:15.051
They're left out by their husbands for no fault of theirs, no.

00:28:15.308 --> 00:28:19.251
Just like that, for some whim,

00:28:19.451 --> 00:28:22.815
they are left on the street with the children.

00:28:23.015 --> 00:28:26.503
More in the Muslims it's worse.

00:28:26.703 --> 00:28:32.440
And I felt very much that I should try to do something,

00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:36.024
at least bring the attention of the people

00:28:36.224 --> 00:28:42.864
to their lot and to their problem so that

00:28:43.351 --> 00:28:50.058
they come up into life and earn their living.

00:28:53.181 --> 00:28:57.088
I think it's a duty of all the Sahaja yogis

00:28:57.288 --> 00:29:01.219
to go and see around who need your help.

00:29:01.419 --> 00:29:06.817
Just don't live for yourself, earning for yourself,

00:29:07.017 --> 00:29:12.519
making money for yourself, but try to help.

00:29:13.132 --> 00:29:17.913
Help those people who can really be helped

00:29:18.113 --> 00:29:23.400
and they should say "Is the Sahaja Yogis who have done for them." 

00:29:23.813 --> 00:29:29.090
So many ideas I have of helping people

00:29:29.609 --> 00:29:36.409
and I'm going to try them with whatever money I have,

00:29:36.963 --> 00:29:45.611
but I wish you could decide to do something for them.

00:29:46.507 --> 00:29:53.719
Specially this country is divided  into at least two parts,

00:29:53.919 --> 00:29:58.880
one is the rich, another is the very poor people.

00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:05.080
These very poor people just make My heart wrench,

00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:10.979
wrench with pain. I don't know how to help them.

00:30:11.179 --> 00:30:15.579
It's such a vast community.

00:30:16.057 --> 00:30:21.337
But if you people decide, you can go around.

00:30:28.364 --> 00:30:35.124
You can go around and you can find out

00:30:35.778 --> 00:30:40.724
ways and method of helping the people

00:30:40.924 --> 00:30:44.937
who are extremely poor.

00:30:45.595 --> 00:30:49.955
They need your help by all means

00:30:51.166 --> 00:30:53.832
and you are capable.

00:30:54.032 --> 00:30:59.607
With the Mahalakshmi's blessings, you are well equipped.

00:30:59.807 --> 00:31:02.555
And try to help the poor.

00:31:02.794 --> 00:31:07.559
Try to help the people who are in great trouble.

00:31:07.759 --> 00:31:10.250
I know they are not Sahaja yogis,

00:31:10.450 --> 00:31:14.450
don't expect them to be Sahaja yogis, they cannot be.

00:31:14.750 --> 00:31:19.236
At the time of Christ how many there were

00:31:19.436 --> 00:31:21.036
who were Sahaja yogis?

00:31:22.464 --> 00:31:26.917
How many people were there who could understand

00:31:27.309 --> 00:31:32.904
the depth of human problems.

00:31:33.104 --> 00:31:40.134
But Christ did and He sacrificed His life

00:31:40.729 --> 00:31:44.649
for the sins of the people. Can you imagine?

00:31:46.415 --> 00:31:51.623
It's a day to celebrate His birthday with very great joy.

00:31:51.823 --> 00:32:00.143
But what a birth and what a life that He had to go through.

00:32:01.558 --> 00:32:06.576
Nobody would like to have that kind of a life.

00:32:07.084 --> 00:32:12.113
But the essence of it we must understand.

00:32:12.313 --> 00:32:15.602
Running after greed is madness.

00:32:15.802 --> 00:32:18.614
There's no end to greed.

00:32:18.814 --> 00:32:22.869
Those who are greedy are greedy all the time.

00:32:23.077 --> 00:32:28.013
They are asking for money, asking for this, asking for that.

00:32:29.644 --> 00:32:34.454
Why not see to others, what do they want?

00:32:34.654 --> 00:32:37.652
Because we are in collective consciousness

00:32:37.852 --> 00:32:42.279
we should understand what do these people want

00:32:42.479 --> 00:32:46.089
what can we do for the people.

00:32:49.787 --> 00:32:53.007
I know it's very difficult

00:32:53.207 --> 00:32:59.008
in those modern times with all the advertisements going on,

00:32:59.744 --> 00:33:05.933
but we are Sahaja yogis. We have to be normal people.

00:33:06.133 --> 00:33:12.866
We have to face it, in a way that a saint has to face it,

00:33:13.066 --> 00:33:21.426
and try to eradicate all these ills by your special powers.

00:33:22.882 --> 00:33:28.513
Today is a day of great joy to Me and to all of you.

00:33:28.713 --> 00:33:34.231
Also at the same time, when I see that the life of Christ,

00:33:34.431 --> 00:33:39.010
such a short life, how miserable it was.

00:33:40.227 --> 00:33:44.017
Not because of poverty, no,

00:33:44.217 --> 00:33:50.187
but because of hatred and because of tortures

00:33:51.241 --> 00:33:53.939
He had to go through.  He didn't mind poverty,

00:33:54.139 --> 00:33:56.993
He didn't write anything about it.

00:33:57.193 --> 00:34:01.745
What He felt bad was really

00:34:01.945 --> 00:34:06.273
the way things are wrong

00:34:07.114 --> 00:34:12.914
and the way they were oppressed

00:34:14.258 --> 00:34:20.214
and He took up all that agony onto Himself

00:34:20.414 --> 00:34:26.100
to solve the problem. He created the Christians

00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:32.065
and what they are doing is nonsense, just a nonsense.

00:34:32.265 --> 00:34:37.745
It has no meaning. It has no meaning to Christ's life

00:34:38.140 --> 00:34:45.060
and it has no meaning to the richness of His great work.

00:34:46.358 --> 00:34:49.891
So when we are celebrating His birthday

00:34:50.091 --> 00:34:56.580
we should also celebrate His sacrificing capacity,

00:34:56.780 --> 00:35:01.222
His power of loving.

00:35:01.486 --> 00:35:05.633
Now Sahaja yogis have become very good people,

00:35:05.833 --> 00:35:09.956
very loving people, no doubt about it,

00:35:10.156 --> 00:35:14.086
but still I think the greed lingers on.

00:35:14.286 --> 00:35:18.786
There's no end to greed. I must tell you,

00:35:18.986 --> 00:35:22.289
I've seen people who are so mad.

00:35:22.489 --> 00:35:26.838
Like in America, they found out those people

00:35:27.038 --> 00:35:32.147
at the top of every organization, corporators,

00:35:32.347 --> 00:35:40.267
who were so rich, but they had twenty-five aeroplanes

00:35:40.934 --> 00:35:44.619
and about fifty, over fifty cars.

00:35:44.819 --> 00:35:47.260
Are they going to travel

00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:51.535
by these fifty cars? How are they going to travel?

00:35:51.735 --> 00:35:56.601
One foot in one car and another foot in another car?

00:35:56.801 --> 00:36:01.612
But they had it, all this kind of madness

00:36:01.812 --> 00:36:06.424
and they said that - now they have nothing to say,

00:36:06.624 --> 00:36:11.289
as such, but now that's all confiscated.

00:36:11.874 --> 00:36:16.698
What will you do with all this kind of a temperament people?

00:36:16.898 --> 00:36:21.005
Isn't it madness to have twenty-five aeroplanes

00:36:21.205 --> 00:36:24.981
and about fifty motor cars?

00:36:25.742 --> 00:36:28.237
And they thought no end of themselves,

00:36:28.437 --> 00:36:31.080
stupid as they were.

00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:35.840
When they will die, all this will finish.

00:36:37.184 --> 00:36:41.458
They're fighting about something in America, such a funny place.

00:36:41.658 --> 00:36:47.538
There you do understand where are we going with our greed?

00:36:48.777 --> 00:36:53.141
There's one incident where a very young girl

00:36:53.341 --> 00:36:58.190
married a very, very old man, very old.

00:36:58.390 --> 00:37:01.448
And when this old man died,

00:37:02.236 --> 00:37:07.612
he left all his money to this young lady.

00:37:07.812 --> 00:37:11.052
So the son came over and he made a case

00:37:11.252 --> 00:37:14.237
that, "I have been his son for so many years

00:37:14.437 --> 00:37:18.601
and how can this lady get all the money?" 

00:37:18.942 --> 00:37:21.757
She got billions and billions,

00:37:21.957 --> 00:37:25.708
but still she wanted to have the whole,

00:37:27.788 --> 00:37:30.147
so she gave excuses

00:37:30.347 --> 00:37:32.835
saying, "I have done so much for him.

00:37:33.035 --> 00:37:34.879
With this old man,

00:37:35.079 --> 00:37:39.102
I have sacrificed so many things,"  and this and that.

00:37:40.003 --> 00:37:43.683
It's a shameless thing the way people are

00:37:44.032 --> 00:37:46.423
and they're not ashamed

00:37:46.623 --> 00:37:50.843
that they're asking for money, money, money

00:37:51.067 --> 00:37:53.987
for comfort, comfort, comfort.

00:37:54.345 --> 00:37:59.520
It's very, very difficult to understand human beings.

00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:03.201
Once they have gone in a strange way,

00:38:03.401 --> 00:38:07.061
they can go to any extent.

00:38:07.429 --> 00:38:10.789
They don't know how to sacrifice.

00:38:11.427 --> 00:38:17.297
When I have seen  when Gandhiji asked people to sacrifice,

00:38:17.668 --> 00:38:21.957
all the women gave away their ornaments.

00:38:22.558 --> 00:38:26.356
They gave away their lives.

00:38:26.556 --> 00:38:29.262
They went to jail,

00:38:29.462 --> 00:38:33.329
did all kinds of things to achieve independence.

00:38:33.529 --> 00:38:37.070
And what is the independence they got?

00:38:37.270 --> 00:38:43.326
Immediately all the thugs of the world became in charge.

00:38:43.526 --> 00:38:47.744
All the thieves of the world became in charge.

00:38:47.944 --> 00:38:55.227
What do you say to such a country where

00:38:56.374 --> 00:39:02.361
everything that is great and noble goes into waste?

00:39:03.079 --> 00:39:06.575
Have you been a noble person?

00:39:06.775 --> 00:39:12.375
Ask yourself, have you been noble?

00:39:13.654 --> 00:39:17.405
Have you tried to help others?

00:39:17.605 --> 00:39:22.879
From the life of Christ, we have to know

00:39:23.170 --> 00:39:26.726
that He lived in poverty.

00:39:26.926 --> 00:39:33.080
He was king of kings, but He lived in poverty, with grace,

00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:44.280
and He did everything for people who were sinful,

00:39:45.347 --> 00:39:52.413
who were in trouble, such a lot, one person.

00:39:52.613 --> 00:39:57.750
Now you are so many, so many of you.

00:39:57.950 --> 00:40:00.864
You all have to do something.

00:40:01.064 --> 00:40:08.024
Don't live like these corporators,

00:40:08.924 --> 00:40:14.499
but try to know that you have to sacrifice

00:40:14.699 --> 00:40:21.699
something of your earnings, something of your luxuries

00:40:22.265 --> 00:40:27.377
for the sake of your country because you are Sahaja yogis.

00:40:27.577 --> 00:40:33.744
You are not ordinary people.  You have got your Realization.

00:40:36.291 --> 00:40:38.802
So what are you doing?

00:40:39.779 --> 00:40:44.658
Are you demanding money from everyone

00:40:45.007 --> 00:40:48.705
or you are giving love to everyone?

00:40:49.081 --> 00:40:53.739
Let Me hear the stories of Sahaja yogis

00:40:53.939 --> 00:40:58.739
who are giving love and compassion.

00:40:59.829 --> 00:41:03.881
I'm sorry today on the day of His birthday,

00:41:04.081 --> 00:41:07.000
I have to tell about His life

00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:11.760
which was very, very painful otherwise.

00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:17.720
For us to understand that such a glorious personality,

00:41:18.025 --> 00:41:21.200
such a great Sahaja Yogi,

00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:27.840
He had to go through so many problems in His life

00:41:29.295 --> 00:41:35.000
and His own people troubled Him.

00:41:36.069 --> 00:41:39.786
His own people tried to take advantage.

00:41:39.986 --> 00:41:45.362
I too have this experience from Sahaja yogis

00:41:45.641 --> 00:41:50.895
who got well out of Sahaja Yoga and they tried to trouble Me.

00:41:51.095 --> 00:41:54.028
They tried to make money out of Me.

00:41:54.228 --> 00:42:01.628
Everyone knows they have such a bad value system

00:42:02.088 --> 00:42:05.528
that how can you say they are realized souls?

00:42:07.323 --> 00:42:14.123
So, we have to think where we can help others,

00:42:14.609 --> 00:42:17.480
what we can do for others.

00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:25.885
This is one of the things one has to learn from life of Christ.

00:42:26.489 --> 00:42:30.520
I was actually born in a Christian family

00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:35.145
and what I found out among the Christians,

00:42:35.345 --> 00:42:39.700
that extremely they were mean, dirty people.

00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:46.692
They were planning against each other and very money-oriented.

00:42:47.064 --> 00:42:52.755
When My father went to jail, they threw us out of church.

00:42:52.955 --> 00:42:58.824
To love your country is a sin, is it? They did it.

00:42:59.470 --> 00:43:02.718
And when he came back and he became the mayor of Bombay,

00:43:02.918 --> 00:43:08.335
of Nagpur, they were his greatest admirers.

00:43:08.535 --> 00:43:11.931
They take out a procession, you see.

00:43:12.421 --> 00:43:15.469
So My father just smiled at it

00:43:15.669 --> 00:43:18.709
and he said,  "See these stupid people." 

00:43:20.340 --> 00:43:26.340
This is complete stupidity and this kind of greed

00:43:27.398 --> 00:43:34.918
and this kind of stupidity must be stopped.

00:43:35.810 --> 00:43:40.360
They run after money, they run after positions,

00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:46.099
they run after also very bad things, some of them.

00:43:46.299 --> 00:43:49.617
Not the Sahaja yogis, but they do.

00:43:49.859 --> 00:43:53.719
But even amongst Sahaja yogis I have found people

00:43:53.919 --> 00:43:58.138
who are very money-oriented,

00:43:58.338 --> 00:44:01.567
and they have made money out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:44:01.767 --> 00:44:07.742
I am such a useless person, I don't understand money,

00:44:07.942 --> 00:44:12.819
so they could befool Me. All right, doesn't matter.

00:44:13.019 --> 00:44:17.376
And for years together, they were befooling Me, it's all right.

00:44:17.576 --> 00:44:21.408
Now what to do? What do I need money for?

00:44:21.608 --> 00:44:27.658
That is the trouble. The trouble is if you are not careful,

00:44:27.858 --> 00:44:30.510
if you are not very money-oriented,

00:44:30.710 --> 00:44:35.932
others can rob you. I say let them rob.

00:44:36.132 --> 00:44:39.223
Let them do what they like,

00:44:39.423 --> 00:44:42.643
but I cannot develop a temperament

00:44:42.843 --> 00:44:47.842
by which I can get after people for money, I cannot.

00:44:48.290 --> 00:44:51.006
I accept whatever account you give Me.

00:44:51.206 --> 00:44:53.651
I accept whatever you say.

00:44:53.851 --> 00:44:57.771
I know it is sinful. It is wrong.

00:44:57.971 --> 00:45:01.899
If they're not aware of it, I can't help it.

00:45:02.099 --> 00:45:05.650
They all will be ruined, all such people. I know that.

00:45:05.850 --> 00:45:10.381
But what to do, if they don't realize it themselves?

00:45:10.581 --> 00:45:14.231
Making money out of Sahaja Yoga, can you imagine?

00:45:14.431 --> 00:45:22.711
Such a stupid thing to do. It's very common, very bad.

00:45:31.139 --> 00:45:36.566
I want you all to be above money,

00:45:36.766 --> 00:45:43.466
to above all these worldly things and you will never starve.

00:45:43.666 --> 00:45:47.042
You will never have problem.

00:45:49.210 --> 00:45:56.450
But do not get mixed up with this kind of nonsensical things.

00:45:56.969 --> 00:46:03.101
This is God's work and you shouldn't make money out of it,

00:46:03.301 --> 00:46:05.881
in no way.

00:46:06.081 --> 00:46:09.981
So we have to learn a lot

00:46:10.181 --> 00:46:14.544
from the great life of Christ, who

00:46:14.744 --> 00:46:18.693
was born as a very humble man

00:46:19.101 --> 00:46:22.421
and He did such great things.

00:46:22.621 --> 00:46:27.595
He tried to improve our Agnyas

00:46:27.795 --> 00:46:33.792
and even now if you think of Him your Agnya will be all right.

00:46:34.284 --> 00:46:36.679
It will be finished

00:46:36.879 --> 00:46:39.639
 I know among Sahaja yogis also there are people

00:46:39.839 --> 00:46:45.339
who are very pushing, who are all the time pushing themselves.

00:46:45.539 --> 00:46:50.410
For what? What do you want?

00:46:50.860 --> 00:46:56.140
All the time they are pushing around

00:46:56.690 --> 00:46:59.990
just like all other stupid people.

00:47:00.762 --> 00:47:06.004
So to feel the satisfaction within yourself,

00:47:06.204 --> 00:47:09.394
just like Christ,

00:47:09.594 --> 00:47:11.780
you have to meditate

00:47:11.980 --> 00:47:15.545
and introspect and find out,

00:47:15.745 --> 00:47:18.933
"Are you satisfied people?"

00:47:19.517 --> 00:47:23.147
You have to be very much satisfied in life,

00:47:23.347 --> 00:47:27.753
otherwise no use having Sahaja Yoga,

00:47:27.958 --> 00:47:32.918
no use getting your Self-realization.

00:47:33.658 --> 00:47:36.054
I bless you from My heart

00:47:36.254 --> 00:47:40.766
that you take the character of Christ

00:47:40.966 --> 00:47:47.035
as a model for you and to understand

00:47:47.235 --> 00:47:51.953
the problems of the world, from the whole world,

00:47:52.153 --> 00:47:54.793
as your own problems.

00:47:55.825 --> 00:47:58.000
May God bless you!
