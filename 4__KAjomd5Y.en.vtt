00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:23.007
Merry Christmas to you all!

00:09:24.733 --> 00:09:26.650
According to Sahaja Yoga,

00:09:28.441 --> 00:09:34.025
Christ is settled on your Agnya chakra.

00:09:42.733 --> 00:09:50.650
His whole life is depicting

00:09:51.984 --> 00:09:57.984
the qualities of a person

00:10:00.275 --> 00:10:05.109
who is a realized soul

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:10.692
and what He has suggested

00:10:10.984 --> 00:10:14.692
in His own life is

00:10:14.984 --> 00:10:22.109
that you should not have any greed or lust.

00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:30.316
The way these days people have greedy

00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:34.441
all over the world is really shocking.

00:10:37.733 --> 00:10:42.441
Right from the childhood,

00:10:42.733 --> 00:10:46.441
our children also learned

00:10:46.733 --> 00:10:49.817
to ask for this or ask for that.

00:10:50.817 --> 00:10:55.650
Only complete satisfaction in life

00:10:56.775 --> 00:11:01.191
can give you that equanimity, that

00:11:01.483 --> 00:11:10.400
balance by which you do not hanker after things.

00:11:15.191 --> 00:11:18.900
These days even India has become

00:11:22.025 --> 00:11:24.692
very much westernised in the sense

00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:32.025
they are also very much wanting to have this and that.

00:11:36.567 --> 00:11:43.692
Actually, now in America, suddenly with this happening,

00:11:46.984 --> 00:11:50.191
people are getting to spirituality.

00:11:51.984 --> 00:11:55.067
They come to spirituality

00:11:55.358 --> 00:12:01.859
because they think they have not found any satisfaction anywhere.

00:12:02.441 --> 00:12:05.441
But we have to see from His life,

00:12:05.733 --> 00:12:08.316
the great life of Christ.

00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:16.316
First He was born in a small little hut,

00:12:16.608 --> 00:12:19.608
as you saw many of them when you come round,

00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:23.483
very much satisfied

00:12:23.775 --> 00:12:27.900
and He was put in a cradle,

00:12:28.233 --> 00:12:39.109
which was all covered with dry, very dry grass.

00:12:41.233 --> 00:12:42.650
Can you imagine?

00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:49.567
And then He sacrificed His life on the cross.

00:12:51.859 --> 00:12:56.733
Whole thing is a story of a sacrifice

00:12:57.067 --> 00:12:59.733
because He had a power,

00:13:01.233 --> 00:13:07.150
power of spirit that He could sacrifice anything.

00:13:07.483 --> 00:13:10.483
He even sacrificed His own life.

00:13:10.692 --> 00:13:18.275
So you can understand the greatness of Christ

00:13:18.567 --> 00:13:27.775
was coming from His great personality of spirituality.

00:13:34.567 --> 00:13:38.191
But the same Christ is worshipped

00:13:38.483 --> 00:13:45.483
all over the world, specially in the western countries

00:13:45.775 --> 00:13:50.358
and you'll be amazed to know how they're running after things.

00:13:52.733 --> 00:13:55.859
All their industries are running

00:13:56.441 --> 00:14:00.650
with big stories about what they make

00:14:01.775 --> 00:14:06.150
and how people boast of their wealth.

00:14:08.483 --> 00:14:11.275
They will have a cross

00:14:11.567 --> 00:14:15.692
in their necks to show that they are Christians.

00:14:16.025 --> 00:14:19.817
First of all one should never wear that cross

00:14:20.109 --> 00:14:22.525
on which Christ was crucified.

00:14:22.817 --> 00:14:29.191
But they do make up by this hypocrisy,

00:14:29.525 --> 00:14:34.275
and they are the another extreme of Christ.

00:14:37.275 --> 00:14:43.067
Not only they, but even their wives and their children

00:14:43.358 --> 00:14:46.441
are all very greedy people.

00:14:46.817 --> 00:14:50.025
They should have this, they should have that.

00:14:50.316 --> 00:14:56.525
But now India is very much in the same run.

00:14:59.775 --> 00:15:02.358
And what do they ask for?

00:15:02.650 --> 00:15:07.067
They think by getting all these things around them,

00:15:08.109 --> 00:15:10.483
they'll be very comfortable.

00:15:10.775 --> 00:15:11.775
It's not so.

00:15:12.109 --> 00:15:15.109
They're all the time hankering

00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:20.900
and they cannot even enjoy whatever they have achieved.

00:15:21.233 --> 00:15:25.025
It is something very surprising

00:15:25.316 --> 00:15:28.525
that in a country like America,

00:15:28.817 --> 00:15:33.817
where there was no corruption,

00:15:34.109 --> 00:15:40.692
but there were people who were making big, big, big money,

00:15:40.942 --> 00:15:45.859
they are supposed to be disciples of Christ.

00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:54.650
It's beyond Me.

00:15:54.942 --> 00:15:59.942
India was once upon a time a real

00:16:00.275 --> 00:16:03.275
saintly country where saints were respected,

00:16:05.567 --> 00:16:11.859
but nowadays India has fallen down

00:16:12.191 --> 00:16:21.109
to such a low level of greed

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:27.316
that impossible to understand these people.

00:16:28.233 --> 00:16:36.441
We can say they had not such a great following of Christ.

00:16:36.733 --> 00:16:41.025
And those who followed Christ, also the Christians here,

00:16:41.275 --> 00:16:43.650
they are the worst.

00:16:44.984 --> 00:16:50.859
They are the ones who have taken to all kinds of western life,

00:16:52.109 --> 00:16:57.109
of greed, and they call themselves Christians.

00:16:58.441 --> 00:17:07.942
But Christ has shown that you don't need anything in this world.

00:17:08.191 --> 00:17:15.608
He's such a great personality, such a great incarnation,

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:21.316
respected all everywhere by,

00:17:21.525 --> 00:17:28.608
because His power of sacrificing was the highest,

00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:37.316
not because He was owning a big car or any big house, nothing,

00:17:37.608 --> 00:17:42.316
only because He was such a humble man.

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:49.109
His life is remarkable.

00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:54.692
And that today He governs the hearts of so many,

00:17:54.942 --> 00:18:02.233
despite the fact He was born a very, very poor man

00:18:02.567 --> 00:18:08.859
and was crucified also as a very poor man.

00:18:09.233 --> 00:18:15.233
So those people who are running after

00:18:15.525 --> 00:18:23.400
money are no way Christians, are nowhere near Christ.

00:18:23.733 --> 00:18:27.233
And so happy and joyous He was.

00:18:27.525 --> 00:18:30.733
And He helped the poor,

00:18:31.025 --> 00:18:34.233
He helped the needy

00:18:34.525 --> 00:18:37.316
because He understood their problems,

00:18:37.608 --> 00:18:40.109
because He could feel them.

00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:46.400
He tried to help all kinds of diseased people,

00:18:46.692 --> 00:18:51.067
underprivileged, while today's

00:18:53.191 --> 00:18:56.275
world has come to such a nonsense that they

00:18:56.567 --> 00:18:58.692
help countries to fight.

00:19:00.775 --> 00:19:04.775
They create Christianity to fight.

00:19:04.942 --> 00:19:07.859
What is Christianity doing in this country?

00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:17.567
It's just to create a big power

00:19:19.358 --> 00:19:21.358
of creating lots of Christians.

00:19:24.650 --> 00:19:29.358
I've heard from many places

00:19:30.650 --> 00:19:34.567
how they are converting people to Christianity.

00:19:36.358 --> 00:19:39.275
Christ never converted even a single soul.

00:19:41.859 --> 00:19:45.233
He wanted to give transformation,

00:19:45.567 --> 00:19:47.942
as you all have got it,

00:19:49.233 --> 00:19:52.942
but not changing the religion

00:19:53.316 --> 00:19:58.692
or changing your birthmarks, no.

00:20:00.483 --> 00:20:05.692
And what did He achieve is this kind of a useless

00:20:05.984 --> 00:20:13.275
third rate people who are running after lust and greed.

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:18.191
I get worried sometimes about Myself,

00:20:18.567 --> 00:20:24.650
that I hope My disciples and My children

00:20:25.650 --> 00:20:28.942
won't do things which are against Sahaj,

00:20:30.067 --> 00:20:35.067
which are against the principle of Sahaj.

00:20:35.358 --> 00:20:39.775
And one of the principle of Sahaj is

00:20:40.067 --> 00:20:46.650
that you have to help people, those who are downtrodden,

00:20:47.025 --> 00:20:50.316
those who are not yet realized.

00:20:50.608 --> 00:20:53.692
You have to give them Realization.

00:20:54.942 --> 00:20:59.775
It is not the way world is going on,

00:21:00.775 --> 00:21:09.942
that we give help to people who are ruining this world.

00:21:11.358 --> 00:21:14.358
If we have to save this country,

00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:17.150
if you have to save the whole world,

00:21:17.441 --> 00:21:20.859
then we have to become like Christ.

00:21:21.150 --> 00:21:24.567
Develop your sacrificing temperament.

00:21:25.859 --> 00:21:29.859
It should be very, very powerful thing

00:21:30.233 --> 00:21:33.400
because you are all realized souls.

00:21:34.733 --> 00:21:40.817
Try to develop that,

00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:46.025
a temperament of helping others.

00:21:47.233 --> 00:21:50.525
I've known some very great people in My life

00:21:51.067 --> 00:21:55.650
who were always willing to give

00:21:56.275 --> 00:21:59.567
to people who haven't got it

00:22:00.859 --> 00:22:05.650
and they have been of such a great

00:22:06.942 --> 00:22:11.275
temperament they were never sort of

00:22:11.567 --> 00:22:15.775
given any big award or anything,

00:22:16.859 --> 00:22:22.233
but very happy if they could help others.

00:22:25.525 --> 00:22:30.733
It's very, very sad today in this country

00:22:31.275 --> 00:22:35.984
where so many people have sacrificed their lives to

00:22:36.275 --> 00:22:38.400
achieve independence and freedom.

00:22:39.692 --> 00:22:42.400
And what is happening is now today,

00:22:42.692 --> 00:22:49.692
same people or may be their children may be, not the same,

00:22:49.984 --> 00:22:53.483
are supposed to be governing,

00:22:53.817 --> 00:22:58.316
supposed to be in charge, are making money.

00:23:02.191 --> 00:23:04.608
Why this situation has come?

00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:07.817
In this country also we had

00:23:08.109 --> 00:23:12.025
many people who were extremely sacrificing.

00:23:12.316 --> 00:23:14.525
They were the leaders.

00:23:14.817 --> 00:23:19.316
But how many of you are like that?

00:23:19.608 --> 00:23:26.608
How many of you would like to give away
something of yours to others?

00:23:26.859 --> 00:23:32.358
What would you do to help others?

00:23:36.109 --> 00:23:40.942
It's very sad that the Christian nations

00:23:41.233 --> 00:23:47.525
have never followed Christ and we also are becoming the same.

00:23:49.441 --> 00:23:53.859
I don't say that we should not do business

00:23:54.150 --> 00:23:56.775
or we should not make money.

00:23:57.109 --> 00:24:04.233
You can, but with all that you must remember

00:24:04.525 --> 00:24:06.733
for whom are you doing it.

00:24:07.025 --> 00:24:10.400
What are you going to do with it?

00:24:10.692 --> 00:24:15.316
With this money, what are you going to do?

00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:23.692
Actually, we should find out at least in one year

00:24:23.942 --> 00:24:27.775
have we given up one of our things to others.

00:24:28.067 --> 00:24:34.067
Not that I say you crucify yourself, no, that's bit too much,

00:24:34.358 --> 00:24:40.067
but can you at least sacrifice a little bit

00:24:40.441 --> 00:24:44.483
of your comfort for the people?

00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:52.692
Sahaja yogis have to be extremely kind,

00:24:52.984 --> 00:24:56.400
extremely kind and loving people.

00:24:57.984 --> 00:25:00.984
If you are not that, you are not Sahaja yogis.

00:25:01.275 --> 00:25:04.942
First thing, you should be kind and loving

00:25:05.275 --> 00:25:09.942
and understanding the problems around

00:25:10.275 --> 00:25:15.275
and try to help as many people as you can.

00:25:16.567 --> 00:25:18.650
But that is not so.

00:25:19.025 --> 00:25:25.358
Even Sahaja yogis do not understand

00:25:25.650 --> 00:25:29.233
what is the value of their life.

00:25:29.525 --> 00:25:33.441
They are on the same path as Christ was.

00:25:33.692 --> 00:25:35.775
They're realized souls.

00:25:36.067 --> 00:25:39.900
They must have that feeling.

00:25:40.191 --> 00:25:45.400
They must have that oneness with the rest of the people

00:25:45.733 --> 00:25:53.025
and they should feel the sacrifice of Christ within themself.

00:25:53.233 --> 00:26:00.233
How He sacrificed His life is to improve our Agnya,

00:26:00.525 --> 00:26:05.733
to remove our ego, to fight our ego.

00:26:05.984 --> 00:26:08.692
But we are so egoistical.

00:26:10.608 --> 00:26:16.984
Whatever He has done is a waste, is something people don't

00:26:17.358 --> 00:26:21.650
understand and they do not imbibe

00:26:21.942 --> 00:26:28.233
His character and His life. It's very bad.

00:26:29.525 --> 00:26:34.525
For us, He's a very great message

00:26:34.733 --> 00:26:38.817
for all the people who are realized souls.

00:26:39.109 --> 00:26:42.275
He's a very great example.

00:26:42.567 --> 00:26:46.275
There are so many things to be done.

00:26:47.567 --> 00:26:56.692
We have, as you know, My mind is always with the needy

00:26:57.650 --> 00:27:02.233
and I've started many such organization.

00:27:02.525 --> 00:27:04.817
You know them very well.

00:27:05.109 --> 00:27:10.650
Recently I started something for the destitute women

00:27:10.859 --> 00:27:14.567
and the orphans in Delhi.

00:27:14.859 --> 00:27:17.441
I paid most of the money

00:27:17.775 --> 00:27:22.150
but, at just the finishing,

00:27:23.483 --> 00:27:26.067
I said "Why not ask Sahaja yogis

00:27:26.358 --> 00:27:30.067
to pay that little money to finish?"

00:27:30.358 --> 00:27:32.775
and they did, they did pay.

00:27:33.067 --> 00:27:38.067
In Delhi, I must congratulate them for showing the way

00:27:38.358 --> 00:27:39.441
to other Sahaja yogis.

00:27:41.150 --> 00:27:46.358
I was amazed how they could raise so much money

00:27:47.067 --> 00:27:51.859
for this big organization.

00:27:55.233 --> 00:27:57.109
It is something we never see,

00:27:58.441 --> 00:28:02.817
how the women are suffering in our country,

00:28:04.233 --> 00:28:07.109
how the destitute women are suffering.

00:28:07.817 --> 00:28:14.817
They're left out by their husbands for no fault of theirs, no.

00:28:15.150 --> 00:28:18.942
Just like that, for some whim,

00:28:19.233 --> 00:28:21.859
they are left on the street with the children.

00:28:23.191 --> 00:28:25.483
More in the Muslims it's worse.

00:28:25.817 --> 00:28:31.817
And I felt very much that I should try to do something,

00:28:32.984 --> 00:28:35.275
at least bring the attention of the people

00:28:35.567 --> 00:28:42.191
to their lot and to their problem so that

00:28:43.567 --> 00:28:49.150
they come up into life and earn their living.

00:28:53.150 --> 00:28:56.150
I think it's a duty of all the Sahaja yogis

00:28:57.525 --> 00:29:00.859
to go and see around who need your help.

00:29:01.109 --> 00:29:06.109
Just don't live for yourself, earning for yourself,

00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:11.608
making money for yourself, but try to help people.

00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:19.316
Help those people who can really be helped and they should say

00:29:19.650 --> 00:29:22.650
"Is the Sahaja Yogis who have done for me."

00:29:23.775 --> 00:29:28.775
So many ideas I have of helping people

00:29:29.067 --> 00:29:35.859
and I'm going to try them with whatever money I have,

00:29:36.650 --> 00:29:44.942
but I wish you could decide to do something for them.

00:29:45.275 --> 00:29:53.775
Specially this country is divided  into at least two parts,

00:29:54.109 --> 00:29:58.109
one is the rich, another is the very poor people.

00:30:00.109 --> 00:30:04.233
These very poor people just make My heart wrench,

00:30:04.525 --> 00:30:10.525
wrench with pain. I don't know how to help them.

00:30:10.817 --> 00:30:15.233
It's such a vast community.

00:30:15.525 --> 00:30:20.817
But if you people decide, you can go around.

00:30:28.191 --> 00:30:34.984
You can go around and you can find out

00:30:35.275 --> 00:30:43.692
ways and method of helping the people who are extremely poor.

00:30:45.316 --> 00:30:49.692
They need your help by all means

00:30:51.316 --> 00:30:56.316
and you are capable. With the Mahalakshmi's blessings,

00:30:56.567 --> 00:31:02.067
you are well equipped. And try to help the poor.

00:31:02.358 --> 00:31:07.650
Try to help the people who are in great trouble.

00:31:07.942 --> 00:31:09.650
I know they are not Sahaja yogis,

00:31:09.942 --> 00:31:13.942
don't expect them to be Sahaja yogis, they cannot be.

00:31:14.733 --> 00:31:19.025
At the time of Christ how many there were

00:31:19.316 --> 00:31:20.942
who were Sahaja yogis?

00:31:22.733 --> 00:31:25.942
How many people were there who could understand

00:31:26.233 --> 00:31:32.358
the depth of human problems.

00:31:33.316 --> 00:31:39.817
But Christ did and He sacrificed His life

00:31:40.109 --> 00:31:44.025
for the sins of the people. Can you imagine?

00:31:46.608 --> 00:31:50.692
It's a day to celebrate His birthday with very great joy.

00:31:51.025 --> 00:31:59.316
But what a birth and what a life that He had to go through.

00:32:01.608 --> 00:32:05.608
Nobody would like to have that kind of a life.

00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:11.525
But the essence of it we must understand.

00:32:11.817 --> 00:32:15.025
Running after greed is madness.

00:32:15.316 --> 00:32:17.608
There's no end to greed.

00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:21.608
Those who are greedy are greedy all the time.

00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:27.109
They are asking for money, asking for this, asking for that.

00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:33.316
Why not see to others, what do they want?

00:32:33.608 --> 00:32:37.400
Because we are in collective consciousness

00:32:37.692 --> 00:32:42.316
we should understand what do these people

00:32:42.608 --> 00:32:45.191
what can we do for the people.

00:32:49.525 --> 00:32:52.025
I know it's very difficult

00:32:52.316 --> 00:32:57.817
in those modern times with all the advertisements going on,

00:32:58.109 --> 00:33:04.733
but we are Sahaja yogis. We have to be normal people.

00:33:05.025 --> 00:33:12.358
We have to face it, in a way that a saint has to face it,

00:33:12.650 --> 00:33:21.025
and try to eradicate all these ills by your special powers.

00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:27.900
Today is a day of great joy to Me and to all of you.

00:33:28.191 --> 00:33:34.316
Also at the same time, when I see that the life of Christ,

00:33:34.567 --> 00:33:38.650
such a short life, how miserable it was.

00:33:38.942 --> 00:33:43.358
Not because of poverty, no,

00:33:43.692 --> 00:33:48.483
but because of hatred and because of tortures

00:33:48.692 --> 00:33:53.067
He had to go through.  He didn't mind poverty,

00:33:53.775 --> 00:33:56.358
He didn't write anything about it.

00:33:56.650 --> 00:34:05.567
What He felt bad was really the way things are wrong

00:34:07.733 --> 00:34:13.525
and the way they were oppressed

00:34:13.817 --> 00:34:20.109
and He took up all that agony onto Himself

00:34:20.441 --> 00:34:25.817
to solve the problem. He created the Christians

00:34:26.109 --> 00:34:31.316
and what they are doing is nonsense, just a nonsense.

00:34:31.608 --> 00:34:37.109
It has no meaning. It has no meaning to Christ's life

00:34:37.942 --> 00:34:44.859
and it has no meaning to the richness of His great work.

00:34:46.358 --> 00:34:48.984
So when we are celebrating His birthday

00:34:49.775 --> 00:34:56.400
we should also celebrate His sacrificing capacity,

00:34:56.692 --> 00:35:00.191
His power of loving.

00:35:01.483 --> 00:35:04.984
Now Sahaja yogis have become very good people,

00:35:05.275 --> 00:35:09.650
very loving people, no doubt about it,

00:35:09.984 --> 00:35:13.067
but still I think the greed lingers on.

00:35:13.358 --> 00:35:18.275
There's no end to greed. I must tell you,

00:35:18.608 --> 00:35:21.608
I've seen people who are so mad.

00:35:21.900 --> 00:35:26.733
Like in America, they found out those people

00:35:27.025 --> 00:35:31.650
at the top of every organization, corporators,

00:35:31.942 --> 00:35:39.859
who were so rich, but they had twenty-five aeroplanes

00:35:40.067 --> 00:35:44.150
and about fifty, over fifty cars.

00:35:44.483 --> 00:35:49.358
Are they going to travel by these fifty cars?

00:35:49.650 --> 00:35:51.650
How are they going to travel?

00:35:51.942 --> 00:35:55.942
One foot in one car and another foot in another car?

00:35:56.233 --> 00:36:01.233
But they had it, all this kind of madness

00:36:01.567 --> 00:36:06.567
and they said that - now they have nothing to say,

00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:10.233
as such, but now that's all confiscated.

00:36:11.316 --> 00:36:16.608
What will you do with all this kind of a temperament people?

00:36:16.942 --> 00:36:20.817
Isn't it madness to have twenty-five aeroplanes

00:36:21.109 --> 00:36:24.483
and about fifty motor cars?

00:36:24.817 --> 00:36:27.984
And they thought no end of themselves,

00:36:28.358 --> 00:36:30.233
stupid as they were.

00:36:30.525 --> 00:36:35.109
When they will die all this will finish.

00:36:36.441 --> 00:36:40.942
They're fighting about something in America, such a funny place.

00:36:41.191 --> 00:36:47.109
There you do understand where are we going with our greed?

00:36:48.233 --> 00:36:52.942
There's one incident where a very young girl

00:36:53.233 --> 00:36:56.817
married a very, very old man, very old.

00:36:58.441 --> 00:37:00.775
And when this old man died,

00:37:01.067 --> 00:37:06.859
he left all his money to this young lady.

00:37:07.692 --> 00:37:10.775
So the son came over and he made a case

00:37:11.067 --> 00:37:14.067
that, "I have been his son for so many years

00:37:14.358 --> 00:37:17.775
and how can this lady get all the money?"

00:37:18.067 --> 00:37:21.650
She got billions and billions,

00:37:21.942 --> 00:37:24.441
but still she wanted to have the whole,

00:37:27.692 --> 00:37:29.692
so she gave excuses

00:37:30.025 --> 00:37:32.525
saying, "I have done so much for him.

00:37:32.775 --> 00:37:34.859
With this old man,

00:37:35.191 --> 00:37:38.400
I have sacrificed so many things,"  and this and that.

00:37:39.692 --> 00:37:42.984
It's a shameless thing the way people are

00:37:43.316 --> 00:37:46.525
and they're not ashamed

00:37:46.817 --> 00:37:50.441
that they're asking for money, money, money

00:37:50.733 --> 00:37:53.650
for comfort, comfort, comfort.

00:37:53.859 --> 00:37:58.650
It's very, very difficult to understand human beings.

00:37:59.067 --> 00:38:02.650
Once they have gone in a strange way,

00:38:02.942 --> 00:38:06.067
they can go to any extent.

00:38:06.358 --> 00:38:09.733
They don't know how to sacrifice anything!

00:38:11.025 --> 00:38:16.316
When I have seen  when Gandhiji asked people to sacrifice,

00:38:17.525 --> 00:38:20.316
all the women gave away their ornaments.

00:38:22.608 --> 00:38:25.109
They gave away their lives.

00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:28.191
They went to jail,

00:38:29.483 --> 00:38:32.692
did all kinds of things to achieve independence.

00:38:32.984 --> 00:38:35.984
And what is the independence they got?

00:38:37.275 --> 00:38:41.900
Immediately all the thugs of the world became in charge.

00:38:43.567 --> 00:38:46.942
All the thieves of the world became in charge.

00:38:47.275 --> 00:38:53.275
What do you say to such a country where

00:38:56.441 --> 00:39:01.025
everything that is great and noble goes into waste?

00:39:03.275 --> 00:39:05.692
Have you been a noble person?

00:39:06.984 --> 00:39:11.608
Ask yourself, have you been noble?

00:39:13.692 --> 00:39:19.400
Have you tried to help others? From the life of Christ,

00:39:20.692 --> 00:39:25.733
we have to know that He lived in poverty.

00:39:26.025 --> 00:39:32.275
He was king of kings, but He lived in poverty, with grace,

00:39:32.608 --> 00:39:43.608
and He did everything for people who were sinful,

00:39:43.942 --> 00:39:51.191
who were in trouble  such a lot, one person.

00:39:51.483 --> 00:40:00.109
Now you are so many, so many of you. You all have to do something.

00:40:00.441 --> 00:40:07.400
Don't live like these corporators,

00:40:07.692 --> 00:40:13.984
but try to know that you have to sacrifice

00:40:14.358 --> 00:40:21.358
something of your earnings, something of your luxuries

00:40:21.692 --> 00:40:26.692
for the sake of your country because you are Sahaja yogis.

00:40:26.984 --> 00:40:32.400
You are not ordinary people.  You have got your Realization.

00:40:36.067 --> 00:40:37.817
So what are you doing?

00:40:39.525 --> 00:40:43.900
Are you demanding money from everyone

00:40:45.191 --> 00:40:48.191
or you are giving love to everyone?

00:40:48.525 --> 00:40:52.984
Let Me hear the stories of Sahaja yogis

00:40:53.692 --> 00:40:58.483
who are giving love and compassion.

00:40:59.900 --> 00:41:03.358
I'm sorry today on the day of His birthday,

00:41:03.567 --> 00:41:06.150
I have to tell about His

00:41:06.441 --> 00:41:11.025
life, which was very, very painful otherwise.

00:41:11.358 --> 00:41:16.984
For us to understand that such a glorious personality,

00:41:17.483 --> 00:41:20.358
such a great Sahaja Yogi,

00:41:20.650 --> 00:41:27.109
He had to go through so many problems in His life

00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:33.733
and His own people troubled Him.

00:41:36.025 --> 00:41:39.150
His own people tried to take advantage.

00:41:39.483 --> 00:41:44.775
I too have this experience from Sahaja yogis

00:41:45.109 --> 00:41:49.984
who got well out of Sahaja Yoga and they tried to trouble Me.

00:41:50.275 --> 00:41:53.275
They tried to make money out of Me.

00:41:53.608 --> 00:42:01.025
Everyone knows they have such a bad value system

00:42:01.358 --> 00:42:04.817
that how can you say they are realized souls?

00:42:07.067 --> 00:42:13.859
So, we have to think where we can help others,

00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:16.650
what we can do for others.

00:42:16.942 --> 00:42:24.608
This is one of the things one has to learn from life of Christ.

00:42:25.900 --> 00:42:29.692
I was actually born in a Christian family

00:42:29.984 --> 00:42:34.692
and what I found out among the Christians,

00:42:34.900 --> 00:42:38.483
that extremely they were mean, dirty people.

00:42:38.775 --> 00:42:45.109
They were planning against each other and very money-oriented.

00:42:45.358 --> 00:42:51.441
When My father went to jail, they threw us out of church.

00:42:52.733 --> 00:42:58.233
To love your country is a sin is it? They did it.

00:42:58.525 --> 00:43:02.608
And when he came back and he became the mayor of Bombay,

00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:07.400
ohh Nagpur, they were his greatest admirers,

00:43:08.733 --> 00:43:11.067
they'd take out a procession, you see.

00:43:11.358 --> 00:43:15.275
So My father just smiled at it

00:43:15.608 --> 00:43:17.859
and he said,  "See these stupid people."

00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:26.150
This is complete stupidity and this kind of greed

00:43:26.483 --> 00:43:34.025
and this kind of stupidity must be stopped.

00:43:35.316 --> 00:43:39.525
They run after money, they run after positions,

00:43:39.817 --> 00:43:45.608
they run after also very bad things, some of them.

00:43:45.942 --> 00:43:48.567
Not the Sahaja yogis, but they do.

00:43:49.567 --> 00:43:52.859
But even amongst Sahaja yogis I have found people

00:43:53.150 --> 00:43:56.567
who are very money-oriented,

00:43:56.942 --> 00:44:00.692
and they have made money out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:44:00.984 --> 00:44:06.817
I am such a useless person, I don't understand money,

00:44:07.109 --> 00:44:11.608
so they could befool Me.
All right, doesn't matter.

00:44:12.608 --> 00:44:16.316
And for years together, they were befooling Me, it's all right.

00:44:16.942 --> 00:44:19.984
Now what to do? What do I need money for?

00:44:20.984 --> 00:44:26.984
That is the trouble. The trouble is if you are not careful,

00:44:27.358 --> 00:44:30.525
if you are not very money-oriented,

00:44:30.817 --> 00:44:34.733
others can rob you. I say let them rob.

00:44:35.025 --> 00:44:38.275
Let them do what they like,

00:44:38.567 --> 00:44:42.150
but I cannot develop a temperament

00:44:42.567 --> 00:44:46.608
by which I can get after people for money, I cannot.

00:44:46.900 --> 00:44:50.900
I accept whatever account you give Me.

00:44:51.275 --> 00:44:53.316
I accept whatever you say.

00:44:53.608 --> 00:44:57.316
I know it is sinful. It is wrong.

00:44:57.608 --> 00:45:00.525
If they're not aware of it, I can't help it.

00:45:01.817 --> 00:45:05.025
They all will be ruined, all such people.
I know that.

00:45:05.316 --> 00:45:09.275
But what to do, if they don't realize it themselves?

00:45:10.567 --> 00:45:13.358
Making money out of Sahaja Yoga, can you imagine?

00:45:13.650 --> 00:45:21.942
Such a stupid thing to do.
It's very common, very bad.

00:45:30.859 --> 00:45:35.567
I want you all to be above money,

00:45:35.859 --> 00:45:42.942
to above all these worldly things and you will never starve.

00:45:43.233 --> 00:45:45.525
You will never have problem.

00:45:48.859 --> 00:45:56.109
But do not get mixed up with this kind of nonsensical things.

00:45:56.441 --> 00:46:02.109
This is God's work and you shouldn't make money out of it,

00:46:03.233 --> 00:46:09.775
in no way. So we have to learn a lot

00:46:10.109 --> 00:46:17.692
from the great life of Christ, who was born as a very humble man

00:46:18.025 --> 00:46:21.316
and He did such great things.

00:46:21.608 --> 00:46:27.191
He tried to improve our Agnyas

00:46:27.525 --> 00:46:32.775
and even now if you think of Him your Agnya will be all right.

00:46:33.109 --> 00:46:39.859
It will be finished.
I know among Sahaja yogis also there are people

00:46:40.150 --> 00:46:43.942
who are very pushing, who are all the time pushing themselves.

00:46:45.233 --> 00:46:49.400
For what? What do you want?

00:46:49.692 --> 00:46:54.984
All the time they are pushing around

00:46:56.275 --> 00:46:58.984
just like all other stupid people.

00:47:00.275 --> 00:47:05.817
So to feel the satisfaction within yourself,

00:47:06.067 --> 00:47:11.441
just like Christ, you have to meditate

00:47:11.733 --> 00:47:18.025
and  introspect and find out, "Are you satisfied people?"

00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:22.733
You have to be very much satisfied in life,

00:47:23.025 --> 00:47:26.733
otherwise no use having Sahaja Yoga,

00:47:26.984 --> 00:47:31.942
no use getting your Self-realization.

00:47:32.233 --> 00:47:39.942
I bless you from My heart that you take the character of Christ

00:47:41.067 --> 00:47:46.608
as a model for you and to understand

00:47:46.942 --> 00:47:52.109
the problems of the world, from the whole world,

00:47:52.483 --> 00:47:54.233
as your own problems.

00:47:55.233 --> 00:47:58.483
May God bless you all!
