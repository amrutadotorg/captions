Talk to Yogis in Rahuri

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:07.000
(India) 7 January 1983.

00:09:04.881 --> 00:09:07.883
You have come here to learn

00:09:07.883 --> 00:09:12.036
something, to go deep into your experiences

00:09:12.036 --> 00:09:18.885
of the knowledge of your roots.

00:09:18.885 --> 00:09:24.094
Shri Krishna has said that this is

00:09:24.094 --> 00:09:27.837
a tree which is upside down, the

00:09:27.837 --> 00:09:31.825
roots are upwards and the

00:09:31.825 --> 00:09:34.784
leaves are outwards.

00:09:34.784 --> 00:09:37.534
In the same way, you

00:09:37.534 --> 00:09:40.993
know that Kundalini really, when

00:09:40.993 --> 00:09:44.719
it rises in the Sahasrara or above

00:09:44.719 --> 00:09:47.984
Sahasrara, then you start getting the

00:09:47.984 --> 00:09:53.377
feeling of Kundalini. So, one has to

00:09:53.377 --> 00:09:57.371
understand that when we are now getting

00:09:57.371 --> 00:10:00.425
subtler and subtler and trying to

00:10:00.425 --> 00:10:02.987
feel the Kundalini, we should try to

00:10:02.987 --> 00:10:08.192
get out of materialistic attitude and

00:10:08.192 --> 00:10:11.257
materialistic viewpoint and materialistic

00:10:11.257 --> 00:10:15.446
sticking point. I had met one

00:10:15.446 --> 00:10:17.915
guru before, because you know I went

00:10:17.915 --> 00:10:20.719
to all of them. And I asked one of

00:10:20.719 --> 00:10:23.653
them, I said, why do you take money,

00:10:23.653 --> 00:10:26.662
so much money from these people who

00:10:26.662 --> 00:10:29.718
are western people? So much, why do you

00:10:29.718 --> 00:10:32.880
take and just they become beggars,
absolutely, like beggars they become

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:35.915
because you charge them so much and

00:10:35.915 --> 00:10:40.708
so heavily??And he told me that unless

00:10:40.708 --> 00:10:42.936
and until you make them beggars

00:10:42.936 --> 00:10:45.465
they will never take to God. They are

00:10:45.465 --> 00:10:48.556
too rich to be near God. I mean,

00:10:48.556 --> 00:10:52.115
this explanation I just could not

00:10:52.115 --> 00:10:55.375
understand, it was absurd, I could not

00:10:55.375 --> 00:11:01.117
understand how can this explanation
have any proper meaning that you should

00:11:01.117 --> 00:11:04.109
make people beggars and
then they be nearer to God.

00:11:04.109 --> 00:11:06.426
I said, in India we have
many beggars, do you think

00:11:06.426 --> 00:11:10.306
those beggars are nearer to God??So he

00:11:10.306 --> 00:11:12.556
said, 揘o, otherwise, you see, they get

00:11:12.556 --> 00:11:14.939
stuck up with their money and you

00:11:14.939 --> 00:11:18.276
must just make them absolutely without

00:11:18.276 --> 00:11:21.548
any money, moneyless people.

00:11:21.548 --> 00:11:29.341
So, I mean, of course to such a
stupid person what can you talk?

00:11:29.341 --> 00:11:30.971
What can you convince?

00:11:30.971 --> 00:11:36.567
I couldn't say to him, then
why are you taking the money?

00:11:36.567 --> 00:11:41.632
Then he would have said,
because I am detached.?

00:11:41.632 --> 00:11:48.224
You see, anything one can say like that if you
start like that you cannot just stop it.

00:11:48.224 --> 00:11:54.166
But one has to understand that
materialism has gone into our roots

00:11:54.166 --> 00:11:59.698
and if we have to clear out our roots
we must get out of materialism.

00:11:59.698 --> 00:12:03.537
That's important, but that does not
in any way mean that you torture your

00:12:03.537 --> 00:12:05.748
body or anything, I dont mean that.

00:12:05.748 --> 00:12:08.598
But what Iam saying, your attention.

00:12:08.598 --> 00:12:13.591
[Shri Mataji addresses some
children] you shouldn't do like that.

00:12:13.617 --> 00:12:17.547
Always Natali you get up which you know is not
good.Always disturb is not good.Sit Down.

00:12:17.547 --> 00:12:19.999
Now even if there are so many
childrens sitting down here.

00:12:19.999 --> 00:12:23.133
Please sit down and dont
disturb any more sit down.

00:12:23.133 --> 00:12:26.400
Sonu come and sit here. Sonu come here.Better....
and then she gets the diarrhea always.

00:12:33.929 --> 00:12:47.214
You are not here just to enjoy but you are here for a
puja do you understand that. You are grown up girl now.

00:12:47.240 --> 00:13:25.330
Look at all these children's how they are sitting quitely.Will they move out? they don't understand English.I have seen all our English children whether it is in Caxton hall or whether it is any hall all of them must go out and
make a big noise and play there. It's always seen they cannot sit down. Look at them these children how quitely they are sitting. What a quality it is! They are just feeling the vibrations and they are enjoying it. They dont want

00:13:25.356 --> 00:14:41.837
to go out.There is no enjoyment outside. Its inside. See them. See the contrast.You must keep eyes open to see. See our children. Now Linda is there she will tell you. She has to manage the children outside the caxton hall.They are shouting,screaming and the caxton hall people will always tell me that its better not have childrens for your program because they make suchh a lot of noise. Its very common problem. They have atleast told me 10 times that please
don't allow children to come in. But the children will never sit quitely even for 5 minutes. As soon as 5 min. will start they will say lets go out.. They can't sit quitely. Poor Sonu whenever she goes out she gets a diarrhea. .....All right Orea you sit somewhere out from there separately. You also.You have only here 3 childrens and you will always see them walking about. and another is Mathews where is he? I have to keep eye on them. It's dangerous.

00:14:43.423 --> 00:14:47.758
So now, when we are
dealing with our

00:14:48.469 --> 00:14:53.171
roots we have to be in the center,

00:14:53.171 --> 00:14:58.085
in the core. In the core mean we are

00:14:58.085 --> 00:15:03.087
taking in, sucking in the feeling

00:15:03.087 --> 00:15:05.321
or you can say the?

00:15:05.321 --> 00:15:12.892
Feeling and awareness put together, what do you
say to that in English, is there any word?

00:15:12.892 --> 00:15:17.157
Is there any word which makes
awareness and feeling put together?

00:15:17.157 --> 00:15:22.418
Is there Gavin?

00:15:22.418 --> 00:15:25.740
[answer: Experience]

00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:28.257
Oh, yeah, experience, you can say the

00:15:28.299 --> 00:15:32.010
experience into your awareness and feeling.

00:15:32.010 --> 00:15:36.738
You have to get the experience
into your awareness and feeling.

00:15:36.738 --> 00:15:40.439
In Marathi it is a very simple word Jaaniiv

00:15:40.439 --> 00:15:42.716
comes from the word ja.

00:15:42.716 --> 00:15:48.176
Ja comes the word spontaneous.

00:15:48.176 --> 00:15:50.829
Also ja has two meaning.

00:15:50.829 --> 00:15:59.495
Ja means also dnyana, awareness, and
also it means spontaneous zaaniiv.

00:15:59.495 --> 00:16:09.859
So you start sucking that within yourself, when
you are not entangled into other things.

00:16:09.859 --> 00:16:14.759
If your attention is entangled
outside, you cannot enjoy.

00:16:14.759 --> 00:16:19.048
So, to be lost into which is
samaadhi you see, is the one where

00:16:19.048 --> 00:16:23.623
your attention is completely
drowned into the experience.

00:16:23.623 --> 00:16:27.249
That iswhat we have to achieve.

00:16:27.249 --> 00:16:32.038
So it is  not only materialism, also emotionalism,all kinds of isms.?

00:16:32.038 --> 00:16:35.380
We are attacked by all kind of isms?

00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:42.503
since the history of word started in this
world I think and now the unholy thing that

00:16:42.503 --> 00:16:48.255
the ism? latest is, could be sahaja
Yoga-ism?

00:16:48.255 --> 00:16:54.933
also could be the greatest word because now
there has to be attack on Sahaja Yoga also.

00:16:54.933 --> 00:17:04.225
In this one is that as I told you, I didnt explain
it properly or you didnt hear Me properly that day,

00:17:04.225 --> 00:17:17.634
that Sahaja Yoga does not mean lethargy or
slowness, not at all, but is a quick and a fast

00:17:17.634 --> 00:17:22.269
stepping in into the dissolution.

00:17:22.269 --> 00:17:25.331
Very quick!

00:17:25.331 --> 00:17:29.226
And once you very quickly

00:17:29.226 --> 00:17:32.176
dissolve into it, the whole movement

00:17:32.176 --> 00:17:34.018
of your body is quick but not jerky,

00:17:34.018 --> 00:17:41.868
is smooth and quick, rhythmic, is musical,

00:17:41.868 --> 00:17:45.034
neither is awkward nor lethargic,

00:17:45.034 --> 00:17:48.110
but is musical, is as a rhythm about

00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:52.073
it, is very gracious.

00:17:52.073 --> 00:17:56.663
The whole movement of dissolution can happen

00:17:56.663 --> 00:18:01.908
to you very easily if you dont allow

00:18:01.908 --> 00:18:09.235
your attention to be attacked by all these isms.?

00:18:09.235 --> 00:18:10.764
There is no end to it,

00:18:10.764 --> 00:18:15.014
I mean, if I have to write all of them I
think we will have to need at least one book

00:18:15.014 --> 00:18:21.099
to write all the ism's of the world, there
is no end to it, which we have created.

00:18:21.099 --> 00:18:25.406
Then the worst of all is now
I think Sahaja Yoga-ism

00:18:25.406 --> 00:18:32.653
in which first of all is
the feeling of lethargy:

00:18:32.653 --> 00:18:37.836
it will happen Sahaja, sit down.
Mother will do everything for you.

00:18:37.836 --> 00:18:41.055
The another is Sahaja Yoga-egoism

00:18:41.055 --> 00:18:44.825
in which we haven't got one fellow lying there,

00:18:44.825 --> 00:18:52.979
in which people sahajayogi's get into tantrums, try
to show off that they are great Sahajayogi's

00:18:52.979 --> 00:18:58.907
they have reached the third stage
or the seventh stage or whatever they may.

00:18:58.907 --> 00:19:04.655
Now it's good this example is a very
good example, I wish you had taken up.

00:19:04.655 --> 00:19:11.096
But see the expression of the Indian,

00:19:11.096 --> 00:19:13.580
the enamored expression, see, it

00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:17.550
so genuine, they can't control the singing.

00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:24.909
Now, see, it's like a ?I just dont know, but people
think it's a package deal sort of a thing.

00:19:24.909 --> 00:19:28.335
It's so nonsensical I tell you, that either

00:19:28.335 --> 00:19:30.495
they could be taken out all their money

00:19:30.495 --> 00:19:35.852
or if they are to be told now for Puja,
all of them are paying twenty-one

00:19:35.852 --> 00:19:41.388
because they have to do this or this extra work, so
they are charging twenty-one

00:19:41.388 --> 00:19:45.202
and if you tell them for Puja they
will even give them fifty-one.

00:19:45.202 --> 00:19:53.404
But I have told some of you have even refused
that I mean it's so shameful I tell you!

00:19:53.404 --> 00:19:58.076
It's absolutely shameful! Can you imagine?

00:19:58.076 --> 00:20:00.237
What is twenty-one rupees to you?

00:20:00.237 --> 00:20:07.883
To them it's quite a lot, because it's some sort of
part of you you are giving which is so nonsensical,

00:20:07.883 --> 00:20:16.819
is a feeling , is a sign of complete negativity. Left Nabhi.

00:20:16.819 --> 00:20:20.423
It's a problem. Materialism
it's complete materialism.

00:20:20.423 --> 00:20:28.520
Those who have been, say, doing
vegetarianism are materialists in India,

00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:37.292
we have seen the cases like you see the Jains
and the Marvari and the Gujaratis.

00:20:37.292 --> 00:20:43.146
They are all vegetarians, supposed to be compassionate people,

00:20:43.146 --> 00:20:48.794
they build some temples also and sometimes
they give to poor people also and

00:20:48.794 --> 00:20:52.783
sometimes to people like Hare-Rama-Hare-Krishna
who are begging in India.

00:20:52.783 --> 00:20:57.118
They give money to them. Supposed to be very compassionate

00:20:57.118 --> 00:21:01.473
They are more compassionate to
chickens than to human beings.

00:21:01.473 --> 00:21:03.962
We have that kind.

00:21:03.962 --> 00:21:10.871
At the same time I have seen in the
West also such materialistic people,

00:21:10.871 --> 00:21:17.841
I mean, they have no shame.
So when you just turn and

00:21:17.867 --> 00:21:24.448
see that, should abhor that,
abhor, it's shameful!

00:21:24.511 --> 00:21:27.776
How could you be like that even
in Sahaja Yoga?

00:21:27.818 --> 00:21:33.364
So as I have told you, there are
some people who are materialistic,

00:21:33.364 --> 00:21:40.036
some people who are emotionalistic
and some people who are egoistic.

00:21:40.036 --> 00:21:45.342
Now leave all these things on the
sides, then you come in the center.

00:21:45.342 --> 00:21:48.384
Now you are in the center.

00:21:48.384 --> 00:21:56.248
In the center, people enjoy just the love
of their Mother, like Shri Ganesha does.

00:21:56.248 --> 00:22:04.093
Just think how your Mother loves you, finished!
Can you? This very sweet feeling

00:22:04.093 --> 00:22:07.409
And who is your Mother if you
really believe in Her, in Sahaja

00:22:07.409 --> 00:22:13.829
Yoga, these two things should solve the problem.
No more thinking.

00:22:13.829 --> 00:22:16.360
Just think how much your Mother loves

00:22:16.407 --> 00:22:24.876
that means you are jumping onto My Kundalini
and when you jump onto My Kundalini,

00:22:24.876 --> 00:22:31.264
then there is no thought,
you cannot think.

00:22:31.264 --> 00:22:39.383
When you think that how much your Mother loves
you, you are jumping onto My Kundalini and

00:22:39.383 --> 00:22:42.677
that time there is no thought.

00:22:42.677 --> 00:22:46.016
It is very simple to
meditate in Sahaja Yoga

00:22:46.016 --> 00:22:48.756
because you have somebody in person.

00:22:48.756 --> 00:22:52.068
They never had somebody in person.

00:22:52.139 --> 00:22:54.529
So I can understand their problems,

00:22:54.569 --> 00:22:56.746
there was nobody in person;

00:22:56.788 --> 00:23:00.461
they had to do it in the air.

00:23:00.461 --> 00:23:06.846
But here a sure shot thing:
you can feel your vibrations

00:23:06.846 --> 00:23:17.194
you can feel My love and you
can feel your own quality.

00:23:17.194 --> 00:23:23.677
It's very simple.

00:23:23.677 --> 00:23:31.831
But it's not the love that is selfish, it's not the love where you

00:23:31.831 --> 00:23:35.295
say, Oh Mother loves me so She look after me,
She will do everything for me,

00:23:35.295 --> 00:23:40.215
She is going to do
everything.

00:23:40.215 --> 00:23:45.791
It's the love that other loves me so much,
what can I do for Her?

00:23:45.791 --> 00:23:51.525
Which is the best flower I can give to my Mother?

00:23:51.525 --> 00:23:54.324
What does She need? She needs nothing.

00:23:54.324 --> 00:24:01.207
She doesn't need money, She doesn't need anything.
What can I give Her?

00:24:01.207 --> 00:24:03.803
Which is the best flower

00:24:03.803 --> 00:24:11.975
Like Shri Hanuman was given a gold necklace by Shri Sitaji

00:24:11.975 --> 00:24:16.878
and He saw that, and He was sitting on a tree and

00:24:16.878 --> 00:24:26.632
He was breaking one by one all of those
big-big gold balls of His necklace.

00:24:26.632 --> 00:24:30.340
So Sitaji said, what are you doing?

00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:35.844
He said, I am trying to see in these balls where is Ram.?

00:24:35.844 --> 00:24:44.204
He said, none of them has, so I am just breaking
them to find out, otherwise why should I wear it?

00:24:44.204 --> 00:24:47.477
And then She said, "Really? Where is Ram?"

00:24:47.477 --> 00:24:54.880
He opened His chest. He said,
see in My chest. He exists there.

00:24:54.880 --> 00:25:00.114
So it is never one sided sort
of a thing, it is a thing that

00:25:00.114 --> 00:25:04.452
exists within you and you feel that
and then has to be reciprocal.

00:25:04.452 --> 00:25:17.180
In the water, if there is a ripple it goes
to the shores and then it returns back.

00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:26.101
So with this force only, I tell you, you
can conquer your ego and super ego.

00:25:26.101 --> 00:25:32.190
There is no way out.

00:25:32.190 --> 00:25:38.056
And for these Indians it is very easy to do because they

00:25:38.056 --> 00:25:43.317
know their Mother's love.

00:25:43.317 --> 00:25:48.281
I know there has been an attack on that point and

00:25:48.281 --> 00:25:50.397
the mothers have been funny there.

00:25:50.397 --> 00:25:55.413
But doesn't matter, when you see
something just put yourself to it.

00:25:55.413 --> 00:26:00.369
To feel your roots.

00:26:00.369 --> 00:26:05.469
These are your roots, and then you see the enjoyment.

00:26:05.469 --> 00:26:09.016
The Mother Earth Herself
is sucking you now.

00:26:09.016 --> 00:26:15.833
She is sucking you down.

00:26:15.833 --> 00:26:18.282
That is how you meditate now.

00:26:18.325 --> 00:26:24.092
This is how you have to meditate, and it's
such a security giving thing.

00:26:24.092 --> 00:26:28.184
It will change your expressions, faces, everything.

00:26:28.184 --> 00:26:40.391
And that enamored expression that you find in these
people will be on your face very soon

00:26:40.391 --> 00:26:49.321
And complete silence will exist once you come on My Kundalini,

00:26:49.321 --> 00:27:01.394
but not through your mental projections, but
through your meditative, spontaneous experience.

00:27:01.394 --> 00:27:05.084
It's very joy giving.

00:27:05.084 --> 00:27:07.933
Just feel the joy of that.

00:27:07.933 --> 00:27:16.197
You are all with Me here and the joy of that
feeling will really enlarge your hearts

00:27:16.197 --> 00:27:21.925
and then, then you can give it to others.

00:27:21.925 --> 00:27:25.421
You don't have to be crazy about these things

00:27:25.421 --> 00:27:33.893
but just to feel it within yourself.

00:27:33.893 --> 00:27:40.042
All right, now I move on to Indians because

00:27:40.042 --> 00:27:44.148
they are different style of people.

00:27:44.148 --> 00:27:48.803
May God bless you!

00:27:48.803 --> 00:27:51.014
(Marathi talk)

00:40:40.970 --> 00:40:42.980
Now, I was telling them, I must

00:40:42.980 --> 00:40:48.405
translate it to you in English is the
most important point

00:40:48.405 --> 00:40:53.980
I was telling that now you are transformed,
now you have become saints, no doubt of it.

00:40:53.980 --> 00:40:56.899
Now from an egg you have become a bird,

00:40:56.899 --> 00:41:03.241
but, now what should happen to you?
Your Kundalini is still in the sacrum.

00:41:03.241 --> 00:41:08.481
How it has happened that now you
have got all the Ganesha Shakti?

00:41:08.481 --> 00:41:14.960
I have made you like Ganesha, in the same
pattern as I had made Ganesha you are made.

00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:22.946
Now you have become a Ganesha,
and from this Ganesha stage,

00:41:22.946 --> 00:41:32.330
which you think you are a Ganesha now,
if I offer you a throne of Shri Ganesha,

00:41:32.330 --> 00:41:37.870
if you have to sit on that throne
as a king, then what should happen?

00:41:37.870 --> 00:41:43.143
Actually, that now your Kundalini should
not be anymore in the sacrum bone,

00:41:43.143 --> 00:41:48.234
but in your stomach, because Ganesha's
Kundalini is in the stomach.

00:41:48.234 --> 00:41:51.497
In the stomach means in the Nabhi Chakra.

00:41:51.497 --> 00:41:58.083
Means all your seeking has been
so far in materialism,

00:41:58.083 --> 00:42:03.787
has been in other things like in money, or in

00:42:03.787 --> 00:42:08.185
power or in love or whatever it was.

00:42:08.185 --> 00:42:13.516
But now your Kundalini itself
is in the Nabhi Chakra, means

00:42:13.516 --> 00:42:18.408
your seeking is nothing but
itself has become the Kundalini.

00:42:18.408 --> 00:42:24.735
Your seeking has become the Kundalini,
means that you are the giver,

00:42:24.735 --> 00:42:28.646
now you are the Guru, you have
now become the Guru.

00:42:28.646 --> 00:42:34.607
When the Kundalini starts from the Nabhi
that means now you are the Guru,

00:42:34.607 --> 00:42:40.967
now you have to give all the
blessings,everything, as a Guru does.

00:42:40.967 --> 00:42:43.506
Now you all have become Gurus.

00:42:43.506 --> 00:42:46.576
But that's only possible when the Kundalini has risen,

00:42:46.576 --> 00:42:52.522
has lifted Her abode from the sacrum
to the stomach,

00:42:52.522 --> 00:42:57.937
and this stage, unless and until it has
arrived, you are not a confirmed Guru.

00:42:57.937 --> 00:43:01.204
Once that has happened you
become a Guru and then

00:43:01.204 --> 00:43:07.268
you can really impress
people and work it out.

00:43:07.268 --> 00:43:09.488
It has to be done very fast.

00:43:09.488 --> 00:43:13.240
It has to work out very fast
and for that, first of all,

00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:16.695
please get rid of your
entanglements which are stupid.

00:43:16.695 --> 00:43:20.551
If you really believe that you
have to progress in your seeking,

00:43:20.551 --> 00:43:25.482
that you have to have your Kundalini
coming up from your Nabhi,

00:43:25.482 --> 00:43:33.281
then please, please hurry up, please try to
work out, otherwise you are very few who

00:43:33.281 --> 00:43:42.159
have been given also the privilege of
doing My Puja, very few.

00:43:42.159 --> 00:43:45.422
And those who have been given have a chance

00:43:45.422 --> 00:43:48.434
to develop to that stage, and
once you become that, all

00:43:48.434 --> 00:43:53.998
of you who have achieved that
stage can become the Gurus.

00:43:53.998 --> 00:43:57.633
And for that, you have to have only wisdom.

00:43:57.633 --> 00:44:00.842
Wisdom, keep to your wisdom,

00:44:00.842 --> 00:44:06.510
and like Shri Ganesha has His
wisdom and in that wisdom He knew

00:44:06.510 --> 00:44:09.632
one thing: that His Mother was all powerful

00:44:09.632 --> 00:44:14.173
and that He doesn't have to worship
anybody else but His Mother.

00:44:14.173 --> 00:44:19.337
And He has to have all the
powers which are granted by Her.

00:44:19.337 --> 00:44:25.215
His powers, no one, even Brahma,
Vishnu, Mahesha does not have.

00:44:25.215 --> 00:44:27.135
They cannot reach Ganesha;

00:44:27.135 --> 00:44:30.920
They cannot reach His stage because
They are one-sided but

00:44:30.920 --> 00:44:34.890
Shri Ganesha has all the powers,
all the Chaitanya powers He has.

00:44:34.890 --> 00:44:38.861
So to become like that, to be like
that,He should be your ideal:

00:44:38.861 --> 00:44:45.559
how He behaved and how He would sacrifice
anything for the sake of Mother.

00:44:45.559 --> 00:44:52.125
Here there are people who don't even
want to pay for something like a puja and ..stuff

00:44:52.125 --> 00:44:56.519
which you may just spend away
somewhere in nonsensical things,

00:44:56.519 --> 00:45:00.600
because your attention has to
be brought round completely.

00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:06.822
It has to be completely severed from
all these nonsensical entanglements

00:45:06.822 --> 00:45:11.279
and there should be less talking and more experiencing.

00:45:11.279 --> 00:45:15.409
Then only it's going to work out.

00:45:15.409 --> 00:45:24.051
It's a good pleasure and a great
thing to be here in this holy land,

00:45:24.051 --> 00:45:27.516
it's a very holy place
you can see it, so peaceful.

00:45:27.516 --> 00:45:30.442
Try to feel the peace within yourself that

00:45:30.442 --> 00:45:34.060
is within every human being and after

00:45:34.060 --> 00:45:36.024
that you have to know that this

00:45:36.024 --> 00:45:39.943
peace that you are achieving
has to be given to others.

00:45:39.943 --> 00:45:45.378
In Sahaja Yoga, perhaps you have realized,
whatever you have got from the nature,

00:45:45.378 --> 00:45:47.995
you can release it back.

00:45:47.995 --> 00:45:53.185
For example if you give vibrations
to a plant you can make it grow.

00:45:53.185 --> 00:45:58.960
If you give vibrations to a flower
you can make it sustain its life.

00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:02.207
For the first time you are giving
something to the nature,

00:46:02.207 --> 00:46:05.983
but as soon as you grow up to that state of a

00:46:05.983 --> 00:46:08.878
Guru then you can give the peace

00:46:08.878 --> 00:46:16.138
that is in the nature, you can give the
feeling of bliss that is in the nature.

00:46:16.138 --> 00:46:19.405
But first achieve it within yourself.

00:46:19.405 --> 00:46:25.993
Make this go inside you and see
that bliss settle down within you.

00:46:25.993 --> 00:46:29.662
You don't see other nonsensical
things which are very disturbing

00:46:29.662 --> 00:46:31.753
sometimes to your western mind.

00:46:31.753 --> 00:46:38.917
For example if a telephone is not working or the road is not all right, if the
bathroom is not this.

00:46:38.917 --> 00:46:45.287
These nonsensical things have no meaning, but
feel the peace outside,

00:46:45.287 --> 00:46:54.415
try to establish that peace within because
this peace you have to give to others.

00:46:54.415 --> 00:46:58.543
The whole development plan
that I have is very fast

00:46:58.543 --> 00:47:01.322
and I am sure you will keep pace with me.

00:47:01.322 --> 00:47:02.393
So may God bless you!

00:47:02.393 --> 00:47:09.300
When you sit down just feel the peace and
try to achieve that peace within yourself.

00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:14.222
Don't pay attention to nonsensical
things and this with this your little

00:47:14.222 --> 00:47:19.011
brain trying to criticize, but try to
achieve the peace within yourself so

00:47:19.011 --> 00:47:22.389
that you can give peace to others.

00:47:22.389 --> 00:47:28.545
It's not proper that some of you are looking after
the negative people all the time, it's not proper.

00:47:28.545 --> 00:47:30.410
You don't have to look
after the negative people.

00:47:30.410 --> 00:47:32.033
Just leave them alone.

00:47:32.033 --> 00:47:36.486
Keep out of that because negative
people can always bring you down.

00:47:36.486 --> 00:47:41.377
Don't try to improve the conditions of the
negative, leave them behind. You go fast.

00:47:41.377 --> 00:47:47.290
Once you have achieved that state
then we can arrange for them to come.

00:47:47.290 --> 00:47:51.334
For example, if My car has failed, all
right, I got into another car, which

00:47:51.334 --> 00:47:53.906
was all right because I have to come to the program.

00:47:53.906 --> 00:47:57.328
Then I can send the tempo
from here to get that another

00:47:57.328 --> 00:48:02.133
car where there were some people who
were not supposed to be at the program.

00:48:02.133 --> 00:48:06.252
That's how you have to be quick and
not bother your heads too much

00:48:06.252 --> 00:48:10.589
about the negative people who are sick
people, trying to be compassionate.

00:48:10.589 --> 00:48:11.574
There is no need.

00:48:11.574 --> 00:48:13.087
Tell them, tell Mother.

00:48:13.087 --> 00:48:14.581
Let you talk to Mother.

00:48:14.581 --> 00:48:18.119
Look after yourselves and
don't be bothered about them.

00:48:18.119 --> 00:48:21.418
This is another nonsensical
idea of compassion you have got.

00:48:21.418 --> 00:48:24.473
Compassion is not mental projection I told you:

00:48:24.473 --> 00:48:27.245
the compassion that works, that flows.

00:48:27.245 --> 00:48:31.217
It's all mental you see for us
compassion is mental, every idea,

00:48:31.217 --> 00:48:36.812
peace is mental, bliss is mental, God
is mental, everything is mental for us.

00:48:36.812 --> 00:48:43.481
He is not. He is the one that
resides in the heart as Spirit.

00:48:43.481 --> 00:48:46.079
He is the one who works
through the compassion.

00:48:46.079 --> 00:48:52.201
And now you know My compassion is
that it flows, it works, it acts.

00:48:52.201 --> 00:48:57.119
It's not mental.

00:48:57.119 --> 00:49:02.696
So don't try to be mentally concerned
with people and try to be compassionate.

00:49:02.696 --> 00:49:03.669
All right?

00:49:03.669 --> 00:49:08.165
I hope you understand that the
compassion is not a mental idea

00:49:08.165 --> 00:49:12.637
that we are compassionate, we are working
for the unity of the world.And all that.

00:49:12.637 --> 00:49:18.184
Even unity and all those ideas, even
the idea of collective understanding

00:49:18.184 --> 00:49:22.649
is in the heart, it should work.

00:49:22.649 --> 00:49:26.193
In Sanskrit it is Kaaryanvit.

00:49:26.193 --> 00:49:29.396
In English there is no word. Kaaryanvit

00:49:29.396 --> 00:49:32.287
is embodied with the working capacity,

00:49:32.287 --> 00:49:35.138
embodied with the working out capacity

00:49:35.138 --> 00:49:38.174
actually working out capacity
you can translate like that.

00:49:38.174 --> 00:49:39.214
It should work.

00:49:39.214 --> 00:49:43.566
If it does not work out then what's the use
of looking after somebody who is sick?

00:49:43.566 --> 00:49:48.415
all right, come along This is
nonsense, this is very mental.

00:49:48.415 --> 00:49:56.659
Just don't waste your energy; you have
not come here to look after the sick.

00:49:56.659 --> 00:50:03.690
I hope you understand this idea of looking after the
sick and being very

00:50:03.690 --> 00:50:06.955
is all ego-oriented, see we are trying to help the sick,

00:50:06.955 --> 00:50:10.824
we are trying to help this, that,?all ego-oriented.

00:50:10.824 --> 00:50:15.420
Another superego-oriented that we
are sacrificing this and that and

00:50:15.420 --> 00:50:20.486
we are becoming beggars in India like the
Hare-Rama-Hare-Krishna. Beggars, parasites.

00:50:20.486 --> 00:50:24.025
Both are just the same, now
please don't do all these things

00:50:24.025 --> 00:50:33.542
and try to keep yourself glued to one ideal:

00:50:33.542 --> 00:50:36.956
that you have to ascend faster.

00:50:36.956 --> 00:50:43.369
You have to individually ascend faster
and collectively pull out everyone

00:50:43.369 --> 00:50:48.097
but not those who are heavily
laden with problems and

00:50:48.097 --> 00:50:51.503
who are creating problems and
objecting your progress.

00:50:51.503 --> 00:50:55.336
That doesn't mean that you are
not compassionate.

00:50:55.336 --> 00:51:01.470
You know how much compassion that I have but
My compassion doesn't make stories,

00:51:01.470 --> 00:51:04.531
I am so compassionate and I am this and that.

00:51:04.551 --> 00:51:09.802
Up to a point is all right but don't so too much
bother about people who are dragging you behind.

00:51:09.802 --> 00:51:12.312
You have come here for a training,

00:51:12.312 --> 00:51:20.661
a training into the understanding
of awareness which is compassion.

00:51:20.661 --> 00:51:24.892
You all have to, even, when you go to the
school, you are not bothered about a person

00:51:24.892 --> 00:51:28.549
who is lacking in the
class, do you?

00:51:28.549 --> 00:51:31.307
You want to study fast so that you come up well.

00:51:31.307 --> 00:51:34.760
In the same way, I would
request you not to bother your

00:51:34.760 --> 00:51:38.773
heads too much about people who
are trying to pull you down

00:51:38.773 --> 00:51:41.699
because I don't want you to be pulled down.

00:51:41.699 --> 00:51:47.931
That's My compassion for them and for you.

00:51:47.931 --> 00:51:50.851
Let Me look after them and you just
don't worry your heads about them.

00:51:50.851 --> 00:51:53.914
They will be all right.

00:51:53.914 --> 00:51:55.070
So, may God bless you!

00:51:55.070 --> 00:52:02.140
Lets have a puja today, and
this puja will be simple today.

00:52:02.140 --> 00:52:07.801
I think we will have Ganesha's Puja and
then we will have Devi's Puja today,

00:52:14.428 --> 00:52:21.055
and then we will have a good havan.
That is a good place for havan.
