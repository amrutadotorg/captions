1
00:00:59,231 --> 00:01:05,412
Beautiful, isn’t it? Tremendous!

2
00:02:17,658 --> 00:02:22,664
If you can get from My purse - he’s got.

3
00:02:30,888 --> 00:02:34,491
Somebody has to translate Me.

4
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:45,747
All right. And in Italian,

5
00:02:45,962 --> 00:02:49,962
Italian language?

6
00:02:50,862 --> 00:02:54,692
Italy – Italian, some…?  Yogi: Shri Mataji,
I can only in French.

7
00:02:54,893 --> 00:02:58,516
Shri Mataji: Only French, all right.

8
00:03:39,307 --> 00:03:42,885
It is so wonderful for your Mother

9
00:03:43,086 --> 00:03:47,425
to see so many beautiful Sahaja yogis
assembled together,

10
00:03:47,626 --> 00:03:52,069
on this day of Sahasrara.

11
00:04:07,877 --> 00:04:15,950
I think the first era of Sahaja Yoga
has ended now, and new has started.

12
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:29,489
In the first era of Sahaja Yoga,

13
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:35,898
the starting point was first the opening
of the Sahasrara.

14
00:04:43,417 --> 00:04:46,602
And gradually –

15
00:04:55,945 --> 00:05:02,110
(it’s not on My…, that’s the point, it’s…
that’s better) –

16
00:05:03,304 --> 00:05:10,304
and gradually moving towards the completion,

17
00:05:11,229 --> 00:05:20,641
I find there are so many who are great
Sahaja yogis today.

18
00:05:32,829 --> 00:05:41,135
It is a very natural process of growth
that you have gone through.

19
00:05:47,871 --> 00:05:56,908
The first one was, we can say, is just
the awakening of the Kundalini,

20
00:06:01,605 --> 00:06:08,220
and piercing the fontanel bone area.

21
00:06:12,285 --> 00:06:17,085
As you see on top of your head these
bandhans,

22
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:22,173
that's how you too have in your head,
same way.

23
00:06:28,508 --> 00:06:36,069
And you have the chakras same way built in,
in your Sahasrara.

24
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:49,365
So in the first era of Sahaja Yoga we have
awakened

25
00:06:49,589 --> 00:06:54,028
the deities in your centers,

26
00:06:54,229 --> 00:07:01,349
in the medulla oblongata and also in
the brain.

27
00:07:10,461 --> 00:07:19,572
But now the time has come for us to
spread it on a horizontal level.

28
00:07:25,908 --> 00:07:34,583
And to move it on the horizontal level,
we have to understand how to go about it.

29
00:07:45,589 --> 00:07:51,229
Like the seven colors of the rainbow,

30
00:07:51,429 --> 00:08:00,029
we have got seven colors of the light
of these centers, of the chakras.

31
00:08:07,668 --> 00:08:15,130
And when we start it from the back,
from the Mooladhara,

32
00:08:15,331 --> 00:08:23,760
bringing it up to the,
this side, Agnya,

33
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:30,388
then it is placed in a different order,
if you see it clearly.

34
00:08:49,149 --> 00:08:56,789
I mean to say that in the Sahasrara,

35
00:08:56,989 --> 00:09:01,389
because it's a concave replacement,

36
00:09:01,589 --> 00:09:08,228
is important to understand that the center

37
00:09:08,429 --> 00:09:18,252
of the fontanel bone area corresponds
to our heart.

38
00:09:33,389 --> 00:09:41,789
So heart is the pivotal point for
the second Era now.

39
00:09:58,397 --> 00:10:02,195
I hope you understand what I mean.

40
00:10:05,348 --> 00:10:11,230
So if you have to place your attention
to Sahasrara,

41
00:10:11,431 --> 00:10:17,379
first thing you have to do is to pay
attention to your heart.

42
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:35,349
In the Sahasrara, the Heart Chakra and
the heart itself,

43
00:10:35,549 --> 00:10:39,909
the Atma, coincide.

44
00:10:46,677 --> 00:10:56,629
Means the Jagadamba becomes one
with the heart – that is the Atma.

45
00:11:08,989 --> 00:11:13,976
So we see that here the yoga takes place.

46
00:11:19,604 --> 00:11:28,444
At this point of time it is very important
to understand

47
00:11:28,669 --> 00:11:34,309
that we have to take a bigger step.

48
00:11:45,149 --> 00:11:52,148
The whole Sahasrara moves in this way,

49
00:11:52,349 --> 00:12:01,150
all these chakras throw their lights
in this way, in a clockwise manner;

50
00:12:01,351 --> 00:12:09,010
and this axis is the heart.

51
00:12:26,069 --> 00:12:35,668
So the essence of all the religions, of all
the prophets, of all the incarnations

52
00:12:35,874 --> 00:12:42,637
is compassion, and it’s placed in this
Chakra of Heart.

53
00:12:57,181 --> 00:13:06,523
Thus we understand that in the second
Era now, we have to have compassion.

54
00:13:17,189 --> 00:13:22,909
Is the manifestation now of the compassion.

55
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:30,788
If God Almighty had no compassion,

56
00:13:30,989 --> 00:13:40,553
He would not have created this great
universe.

57
00:13:46,749 --> 00:13:55,318
Actually His Power, or the Adi Shakti,
is the embodiment of His compassion.

58
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:11,270
And this compassion has brought forth
all the evolution to human level,

59
00:14:11,471 --> 00:14:17,009
and even your emancipation as Sahaja yogis.

60
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:35,913
And compassion is always completely covered
with forgiveness.

61
00:14:44,804 --> 00:14:50,587
So you can see, the Trinity meets
at this point.

62
00:14:53,549 --> 00:15:03,906
The Son of God is forgiveness,
is the embodiment of forgiveness.

63
00:15:08,925 --> 00:15:14,205
So the God Almighty who is the witness,

64
00:15:15,109 --> 00:15:19,949
the Mother who is the compassion and
the Child who is the forgiveness,

65
00:15:20,149 --> 00:15:26,705
all of them meet at Heart Chakra,
in the Sahasrara.

66
00:15:42,285 --> 00:15:52,884
Now, one must learn how to improve
Sahasrara itself.

67
00:16:01,045 --> 00:16:06,642
You know the presiding deity
of the Sahasrara very well.

68
00:16:13,669 --> 00:16:24,028
Now the place of Sahasrara is in your head,
as you think it to be,

69
00:16:24,229 --> 00:16:29,809
but it’s just the center of the whole
universe.

70
00:16:39,405 --> 00:16:44,548
To develop this, you have to pay attention

71
00:16:44,749 --> 00:16:51,358
to your Heart Chakra in the fontanel bone
area.

72
00:17:04,448 --> 00:17:09,122
If you pay attention to the fontanel bone
area,

73
00:17:09,323 --> 00:17:16,071
then there you must establish the deity.

74
00:17:27,893 --> 00:17:34,693
But this deity has to be first established
into the heart.

75
00:17:39,133 --> 00:17:45,521
Now you are very lucky people that you have
the deity in person with you.

76
00:17:58,317 --> 00:18:03,708
The people who got realization before
I came on this Earth

77
00:18:03,909 --> 00:18:07,602
had to imagine the deities,

78
00:18:15,709 --> 00:18:21,829
and in that imagination they were never
perfect.

79
00:18:26,382 --> 00:18:32,422
But as they say that at Sahasrara She is
Mahamaya –

80
00:18:37,205 --> 00:18:40,821
that is how it is described –

81
00:18:41,405 --> 00:18:48,934
so if you also see the person, you
may not be knowing fully that person

82
00:18:49,135 --> 00:18:53,764
or in the perfect way or a complete way,

83
00:19:01,293 --> 00:19:07,053
because Mahamaya Shakti is much greater
than your imagination.

84
00:19:13,444 --> 00:19:17,164
That is why one has to surrender.

85
00:19:18,612 --> 00:19:24,451
With your limited imagination of brain,

86
00:19:24,652 --> 00:19:31,018
one cannot see the deity.

87
00:19:36,629 --> 00:19:41,124
Also it is said She is Bhakti Gamya:
you can know through bhakti,

88
00:19:41,325 --> 00:19:44,509
through devotion.

89
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:53,801
So the devotion has to be there, but
the devotion has to be

90
00:19:54,002 --> 00:19:59,946
a very clean devotion, in the sense there
should be no malice in the heart.

91
00:20:00,147 --> 00:20:03,428
Heart should be clean.

92
00:20:11,445 --> 00:20:16,841
Heart, to keep it clean is very difficult.

93
00:20:22,349 --> 00:20:30,994
Always human beings have a relative
understanding of reality,

94
00:20:33,669 --> 00:20:37,509
but reality is absolute.

95
00:20:38,909 --> 00:20:47,784
So to achieve that, one has to get rid of
all the other kind of impurities

96
00:20:47,985 --> 00:20:51,548
that are within the heart.

97
00:20:56,613 --> 00:21:04,940
So in the beginning we try to achieve
our realization,

98
00:21:05,141 --> 00:21:08,822
not with very clean heart.

99
00:21:16,965 --> 00:21:21,662
At that time we had lots of attachments,

100
00:21:22,749 --> 00:21:27,726
we were identified with false things.

101
00:21:30,354 --> 00:21:40,319
And also we thought by getting realization
we’ll become very powerful people.

102
00:21:49,549 --> 00:21:57,749
After realization also, we started
indulging into petty things.

103
00:22:04,148 --> 00:22:13,382
We started asking for favors for our
relations, friends, mothers, sisters;

104
00:22:17,293 --> 00:22:26,599
and the women thought of their husbands
and their brothers, children.

105
00:22:29,504 --> 00:22:38,177
They all asked for the blessings of all
those with whom they were entangled.

106
00:22:48,429 --> 00:22:54,762
All this entanglement you got over, I know,
very soon.

107
00:23:04,829 --> 00:23:15,458
Now the job of a Avatara is such that He
has to fulfill the desires of His bhaktas.

108
00:23:18,976 --> 00:23:24,875
(Repeats to the interpreter) ...job of
an Avatara is such that He has to fulfill,

109
00:23:25,076 --> 00:23:32,749
He has to fulfill the desires of His
bhaktas, His disciples.

110
00:23:45,749 --> 00:23:52,165
For example, Shri Krishna was asked by
gopis that, “We want You to be with us,

111
00:23:52,366 --> 00:23:56,206
individually, with every one of us.”

112
00:24:05,365 --> 00:24:13,537
So He divided Himself into many Krishnas,
and He was with every one of them.

113
00:24:20,389 --> 00:24:24,733
But that was a very divine desire, I think;

114
00:24:24,934 --> 00:24:29,473
that was a very divine desire of the gopis.

115
00:24:31,461 --> 00:24:35,803
But when you asked Me about your
brothers, sisters, mothers, fathers,

116
00:24:36,004 --> 00:24:41,309
I tried to do that, whatever was possible.

117
00:24:46,869 --> 00:24:52,650
Also the kshema that you asked for,
ashrams you asked for,

118
00:24:52,851 --> 00:24:56,971
all the things that you needed,

119
00:24:58,589 --> 00:25:05,190
was there for your desire to be fulfilled.

120
00:25:14,965 --> 00:25:19,389
So at the Krishna's level it was: "Yoga
kshemam vahamyaham."

121
00:25:19,589 --> 00:25:24,105
So the kshema was looked after at Krishna's
level,

122
00:25:33,493 --> 00:25:36,933
because it was promised.

123
00:25:38,189 --> 00:25:43,062
But what next, in the new Era that has
to come?

124
00:25:48,189 --> 00:25:55,064
As you have now good families, good
ashrams, good jobs,

125
00:25:55,265 --> 00:26:01,243
everyone is happy, let us think of the next
Era.

126
00:26:16,173 --> 00:26:21,053
Next Era is of compassion, as I told you.

127
00:26:23,525 --> 00:26:29,198
But any one of the chakras are weak in you
still;

128
00:26:32,637 --> 00:26:37,557
the light that becomes white because
of the seven colors

129
00:26:37,758 --> 00:26:43,161
may dim out, or may be defective.

130
00:26:50,301 --> 00:26:57,164
So, all the chakras that are within us are
to be looked after.

131
00:27:02,525 --> 00:27:10,860
To pay attention to every chakra, and put
compassion,

132
00:27:11,061 --> 00:27:16,693
the feeling of compassion on these chakras.

133
00:27:31,309 --> 00:27:35,767
Now let us take the Chakra of Shri Ganesh.

134
00:27:39,269 --> 00:27:43,760
You pay attention to Shri Ganesha

135
00:27:43,961 --> 00:27:52,509
and establish Him through your thought –
because now your thought is divine –

136
00:27:52,709 --> 00:27:57,549
in the Mooladhara Chakra, with great
respect.

137
00:28:18,828 --> 00:28:25,977
Here now, you have to know that
in the first era of Sahaja Yoga

138
00:28:26,178 --> 00:28:29,395
I could not have talked of these things
to you, of …

139
00:28:29,596 --> 00:28:36,629
This is much subtler doing, subtler work.

140
00:28:42,749 --> 00:28:47,949
Now put your feeling on that chakra.

141
00:28:48,149 --> 00:28:56,149
Chakra is the pradesha, is the country,
and the king is Shri Ganesh.

142
00:29:01,429 --> 00:29:04,743
And that's the country.

143
00:29:06,477 --> 00:29:11,108
Now when you put your attention onto
that chakra,

144
00:29:11,309 --> 00:29:16,269
put your feelings towards Him,

145
00:29:23,989 --> 00:29:32,909
of feeling of love and adoration to Him,
to begin with.

146
00:29:37,149 --> 00:29:43,835
And then to manifest compassion, you have
to ask nothing but one thing,

147
00:29:44,036 --> 00:29:55,921
that, "O God of Innocence, give innocence
to all the people of the world."

148
00:30:05,613 --> 00:30:11,426
But first you have to be innocent to ask
that; otherwise,

149
00:30:11,627 --> 00:30:18,469
it is unauthorized asking, or you can say,
you have no right to ask.

150
00:30:27,389 --> 00:30:34,821
So to understand innocence you should
try to understand yourself,

151
00:30:35,022 --> 00:30:39,029
how your mind is working.

152
00:30:44,797 --> 00:30:49,414
When you, say, look at anyone,

153
00:30:49,614 --> 00:30:54,828
do you feel that you should possess that
person?

154
00:30:55,029 --> 00:31:04,360
Do you feel unduly attracted, or something
base feeling comes into your mind?

155
00:31:18,471 --> 00:31:23,357
For an innocent person, when he sees
a beautiful person,

156
00:31:23,558 --> 00:31:28,909
or a woman, or a beautiful scene or
a beautiful creation,

157
00:31:29,109 --> 00:31:35,105
the first thing should happen that he
becomes thoughtless – there’s no thought.

158
00:31:48,709 --> 00:31:53,431
So if there is no thought, there's
no question of having

159
00:31:53,632 --> 00:32:00,707
any expression of possessiveness or
any kind of a baser feeling.

160
00:32:12,509 --> 00:32:19,035
But if you pray to Shri Ganesha, also
unauthorized a little bit, that,

161
00:32:19,236 --> 00:32:27,909
"Please make me innocent, so that I'm
empowered to ask You for this boon,

162
00:32:28,109 --> 00:32:37,909
that wherever I go I become the source
of innocence.

163
00:32:51,448 --> 00:32:58,765
So that I emit innocence: when people
look at me,

164
00:32:58,966 --> 00:33:02,749
they feel I am innocent."

165
00:33:10,413 --> 00:33:13,493
This is compassion,

166
00:33:15,029 --> 00:33:24,951
the compassion to ask Him to give you
the power of compassion itself.

167
00:33:35,413 --> 00:33:41,545
So that, as you see here these beautiful
centers,

168
00:33:41,746 --> 00:33:48,869
as if the light starts moving horizontally;

169
00:34:00,389 --> 00:34:07,218
it starts moving on the sympathetic nervous
system.

170
00:34:09,149 --> 00:34:15,564
So you become the powerful innocence
yourself.

171
00:34:19,109 --> 00:34:26,137
You don't become stupid or childish, but
you become child-like.

172
00:34:32,509 --> 00:34:40,549
The whole behavior is extremely dignified
and innocent.

173
00:34:44,349 --> 00:34:48,016
Normally if you find a person who is
dignified,

174
00:34:48,217 --> 00:34:53,177
is normally, he’s not an innocent person,

175
00:34:56,973 --> 00:35:01,052
because he puts up a show – it's
a deliberation to become serious

176
00:35:01,253 --> 00:35:06,308
and show that he’s very dignified,
to impress others.

177
00:35:12,373 --> 00:35:21,156
And child doesn’t put up the show
of innocence, of dignity or anything,

178
00:35:21,357 --> 00:35:27,070
because the child is not aware
of deliberations.

179
00:35:35,845 --> 00:35:43,088
But you develop that rare combination
of innocent dignity.

180
00:35:52,149 --> 00:35:58,504
Now the other quality of, say, Shri Ganesha
starts expressing itself

181
00:35:58,705 --> 00:36:07,073
on horizontal level, that you become
discreet.

182
00:36:15,413 --> 00:36:22,367
But that is a power, I'm again saying,
the power of discretion you develop.

183
00:36:26,709 --> 00:36:31,242
Now one must understand the difference
between the power of discretion,

184
00:36:31,443 --> 00:36:35,029
and discretion itself.

185
00:36:38,061 --> 00:36:42,236
So “the power” means it acts.

186
00:36:46,525 --> 00:36:50,241
For example, you may not speak,

187
00:36:50,442 --> 00:36:58,267
but if you are standing somewhere the
discretion itself will act in the situation.

188
00:37:06,829 --> 00:37:11,944
Like a Sahaja yogi, supposing is a good
Sahaja yogi, is going in a train,

189
00:37:12,145 --> 00:37:19,240
and the train has an accident – mostly it
will not have, but has – nobody will die.

190
00:37:30,396 --> 00:37:38,837
So you establish the discretion which is
power itself,

191
00:37:39,038 --> 00:37:44,429
that acts by itself. You don't have to say
that you act, it acts,

192
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:48,718
but you just become the vehicle,
a beautiful clean vehicle

193
00:37:48,919 --> 00:37:52,320
of that discretion.

194
00:38:05,934 --> 00:38:12,428
Then you should believe, now you are
spreading horizontally.

195
00:38:21,749 --> 00:38:30,374
In the first era of Sahaja Yoga, you needed
to see Me in person.

196
00:38:31,565 --> 00:38:35,972
(Repeats to the interpreter:) You needed
to see Me in person.

197
00:38:39,909 --> 00:38:45,003
As we say in Sanskrit, a “dhyeya”:
is the target.

198
00:38:45,204 --> 00:38:49,289
You wanted the target in front of you.

199
00:38:57,091 --> 00:39:00,723
(To the interpreter:) But see, there’s
no word in English!

200
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:06,261
Dhyeya: whatever is to be achieved.

201
00:39:09,309 --> 00:39:12,148
Because there’s no word in the English
language, what to do?

202
00:39:12,349 --> 00:39:16,163
So now when you wanted that all the time,

203
00:39:16,364 --> 00:39:21,850
and you felt happy, secured, joyous

204
00:39:22,051 --> 00:39:26,891
when you had that in person before you.

205
00:39:37,608 --> 00:39:44,967
Then in the second era, now, you will not
desire so much

206
00:39:45,168 --> 00:39:50,881
 that Mother should be there – you'll take
it over from Me.

207
00:40:04,789 --> 00:40:10,039
This is the divine desire I'm telling you
about,

208
00:40:12,789 --> 00:40:19,127
and you have to work on that from today
onwards.

209
00:40:25,592 --> 00:40:29,351
I am with you, you know that; but need not
be in this body,

210
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:34,396
because I don’t know if I exist in this
body or not.

211
00:40:40,804 --> 00:40:48,778
But once this desire starts working, you
will see tremendous miracles happening.

212
00:40:57,429 --> 00:41:05,726
When the child is born to a mother,
automatically she gets milk.

213
00:41:11,601 --> 00:41:16,688
So the nature is so connected with
the whole thing.

214
00:41:16,889 --> 00:41:22,008
In your divine desire also it is connected.

215
00:41:30,925 --> 00:41:36,250
And it is very evident when you are
a divine person.

216
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:41,865
So you may find Me anywhere: you are
walking on the street,

217
00:41:42,066 --> 00:41:46,949
suddenly you might find Mataji walking
with you.

218
00:41:59,065 --> 00:42:05,840
So this is the second Era we have started,
and you should not be shocked

219
00:42:06,041 --> 00:42:14,953
if you see Me sitting on your bed and
putting My hand on your head.

220
00:42:31,537 --> 00:42:38,459
Or you may see Me in the form of Christ
walking into your room,

221
00:42:42,434 --> 00:42:45,561
or as Shri Rama.

222
00:42:46,857 --> 00:42:52,949
That has to happen, so you should be
prepared.

223
00:43:00,161 --> 00:43:07,115
Already so many miracles have taken place
on you, but on a grosser level.

224
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:14,467
We have seen the light coming on My head,

225
00:43:14,668 --> 00:43:19,308
and the photographs have shown some
miracles to you.

226
00:43:26,749 --> 00:43:34,153
But many things will happen, that you will
see something that you could never imagine.

227
00:43:41,417 --> 00:43:48,475
This has to happen, just to convince you
that you have reached a certain height

228
00:43:48,676 --> 00:43:57,142
of your evolution in the new area
of Pragnya Loka.

229
00:44:05,749 --> 00:44:10,145
Because this is a new state into which
now you will be entering,

230
00:44:10,346 --> 00:44:13,639
on a horizontal basis.

231
00:44:20,589 --> 00:44:29,853
In this area you will give up asking for
gross things,

232
00:44:36,149 --> 00:44:45,549
and also for anything subtler, anything
that is subtle.

233
00:44:49,361 --> 00:44:52,924
The asking will disappear,

234
00:44:53,734 --> 00:44:58,994
and that is the time you’ll become very
powerful.

235
00:45:03,489 --> 00:45:08,094
Whatever I say happens, as you know;

236
00:45:11,069 --> 00:45:21,650
only thing, I cannot command you
to be evolved.

237
00:45:28,869 --> 00:45:39,415
The Kundalini's work in you has been done,
quite a lot.

238
00:45:44,137 --> 00:45:50,914
Now the new work of compassion,
of spreading it to others

239
00:45:51,115 --> 00:45:55,826
has to be done by you.

240
00:46:08,109 --> 00:46:11,509
As the light grows brighter and brighter,

241
00:46:11,709 --> 00:46:18,458
the area it covers becomes bigger
and bigger.

242
00:46:26,829 --> 00:46:31,690
So you become the giver of compassion.

243
00:46:35,577 --> 00:46:39,028
In My last lecture, which you have heard
already,

244
00:46:39,229 --> 00:46:44,339
I have requested you how to do tapah
(penitence).

245
00:46:44,607 --> 00:46:46,782
Yogi: We could not hear it, Shri Mataji.

246
00:46:46,983 --> 00:46:50,597
Oh, I see, I’m sorry. All right.

247
00:47:01,001 --> 00:47:05,659
With a complete surrendered mind

248
00:47:05,860 --> 00:47:14,515
you have to go through the pilgrimage, say,
of this castle.

249
00:47:30,457 --> 00:47:34,580
This is one of the glimpses of the tapah
that you have to do,

250
00:47:34,781 --> 00:47:42,397
because I am told some of you had
to get into little difficulties,

251
00:47:42,587 --> 00:47:49,433
and you people suffered a little bit
on your way for the pilgrimage.

252
00:47:57,481 --> 00:48:08,072
But it is fun to be venturesome and to get
into places

253
00:48:08,273 --> 00:48:14,718
where the devils dare not go.
Yogi: (Mais)... it is fun.

254
00:48:15,171 --> 00:48:17,229
Fun: no word!
Yogi: No word in French.

255
00:48:17,429 --> 00:48:20,689
They have never fun!

256
00:48:20,890 --> 00:48:24,442
Let us see, it is miserable!

257
00:48:37,664 --> 00:48:45,045
And if you know how to get fun out
of the so-called discomforts,

258
00:48:45,246 --> 00:48:49,972
then you should know you are on the right
lines.

259
00:49:01,589 --> 00:49:06,629
And as you start becoming discreet
automatically,

260
00:49:06,829 --> 00:49:11,055
you should know you are progressing well.

261
00:49:17,029 --> 00:49:21,785
As you become more peaceful and your temper
vanishes in the thin air

262
00:49:21,986 --> 00:49:30,309
as soon as you see somebody attacking you,
then know that you are progressing well.

263
00:49:48,841 --> 00:49:59,467
As soon as you see a ordeal or a calamity
falling on the personality

264
00:49:59,668 --> 00:50:06,508
and you do not get worried about it, then
know that you are progressing.

265
00:50:15,217 --> 00:50:17,676
No amount ….

266
00:50:20,053 --> 00:50:30,720
When no amount of artificiality can impress
you, then know that you are progressing.

267
00:50:38,589 --> 00:50:47,389
No amount of material well-being in others

268
00:50:47,589 --> 00:50:57,271
makes you unhappy, no more unhappy,
then know that you are progressing well.

269
00:51:06,401 --> 00:51:11,752
No amount of

270
00:51:17,032 --> 00:51:28,611
labor or - or troubles are sufficient

271
00:51:29,783 --> 00:51:36,670
to become a Sahaja yogi. Any – whatever you
may try, one cannot become a Sahaja yogi,

272
00:51:36,871 --> 00:51:42,803
while you have got it without any effort.

273
00:51:43,004 --> 00:51:47,029
So you are something special.

274
00:51:55,984 --> 00:52:04,189
So this, once you understand that you are
special, you will become humble about it.

275
00:52:09,641 --> 00:52:15,266
Then when it happens to you that you’ve
humbled down

276
00:52:15,467 --> 00:52:20,303
when you see you have achieved something,
that you have some powers,

277
00:52:20,504 --> 00:52:26,409
that you are emitting innocence, that
you are discreet,

278
00:52:26,610 --> 00:52:30,967
and as a result of that you become more
compassion,

279
00:52:31,168 --> 00:52:35,229
humbler personality, a sweeter personality,

280
00:52:35,429 --> 00:52:43,587
then you should believe that you are
in the heart of your Mother.

281
00:53:02,208 --> 00:53:10,780
This is what is the sign of the new
Sahaja yogi now in the new Era,

282
00:53:10,981 --> 00:53:18,989
who has to move with new force.

283
00:53:30,069 --> 00:53:39,676
Where you will grow so fast that without
meditation, you will be in meditation;

284
00:53:44,809 --> 00:53:50,255
without being in My presence, you will be
in My presence;

285
00:53:58,697 --> 00:54:06,584
without asking, you will be blessed
by your Father.

286
00:54:10,246 --> 00:54:19,348
This is what you are in for; and again
I welcome you to this new Era today,

287
00:54:19,617 --> 00:54:23,589
on this great day of Sahasrara.

288
00:54:33,869 --> 00:54:37,378
May God bless you all.
