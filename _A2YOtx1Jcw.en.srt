1
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:27,710
First – we bow to Shri Ganesha 
because Shri Ganesha is the source of innocence

2
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:29,619
within us.

3
00:00:29,619 --> 00:00:39,360
So actually we bow to innocence within us.

4
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:52,750
And this innocence is the one [that] gives
you the enlightenment.

5
00:00:52,750 --> 00:01:09,010
As I told you yesterday the light has innocence,
but this is innocent without knowledge.

6
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:15,660
But your light is innocent with knowledge.

7
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:23,860
We always think that the people who have got
knowledge can never be innocent, can never

8
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:26,350
be simple.

9
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:34,430
And the idea we have got about innocence is
that a innocent person is always deceived,

10
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:44,080
can be befooled – and can be always taken
for granted.

11
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:57,830
But innocence is a power; it is a power which
protects you, which gives you light of knowledge.

12
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:10,390
Knowledge that we have in the worldly sense
is how to exploit others, how to cheat others,

13
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:25,280
how to make money out of them, how to make
fun of others, how to look down upon others.

14
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:34,680
But the light of innocence is the light by
which you know that love is the highest thing.

15
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:46,670
And it teaches you how to love others, how
to care for others, how to be gentle about

16
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:47,780
others.

17
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:51,280
It also gives you the light within.

18
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,940
It’s just the other way round of this Avidya
that we have in this world.

19
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:59,709
Just the other way round.

20
00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:15,200
The Avidya outside teaches us competition,
how to put the other person down.

21
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:22,420
Because it has fear, it is insecured.

22
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:28,069
This knowledge is not secured – at all.

23
00:03:28,069 --> 00:03:35,010
If it had security it would not have behaved
like this.

24
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:40,110
But the light of innocence knows everything.

25
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:45,270
It has no fear.

26
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:54,040
When we say ‘children are innocent’ we
mean to say that they have that power of innocence.

27
00:03:54,040 --> 00:04:02,840
Many times people have noticed if a child
falls from a height, it doesn’t die; while

28
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:10,319
a young man may die with a much smaller height.

29
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,480
And the child is not afraid while falling.

30
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:22,770
He just enjoys, as if there is a parachute
coming down, you know, nicely.

31
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:26,770
And then when he falls down, also he just
gets up, laughs, smiles at everyone.

32
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:32,580
He doesn’t understand why everybody is worried.

33
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:38,849
Because in that innocence he knows that he’s
looked after, he’s protected.

34
00:04:38,849 --> 00:04:48,839
He knows that there is a power, which is much
higher than him and he does not have to worry.

35
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:56,729
Then we start putting ideas into the head
of the child, and that is how he starts losing

36
00:04:56,729 --> 00:05:10,189
his power of innocence and he becomes a coward,
he becomes a cunning fellow, he becomes an

37
00:05:10,189 --> 00:05:17,189
unrighteous personality.

38
00:05:17,189 --> 00:05:27,349
But still we would say that the innocence
of children is [the] innocence of ignorance,

39
00:05:27,349 --> 00:05:35,499
in a way, because they do not know the dangers
of life.

40
00:05:35,499 --> 00:05:48,589
But the light of innocence knows all the dangers,
and also knows how to get rid of it, also

41
00:05:48,589 --> 00:05:53,070
knows how to be away from such a person.

42
00:05:53,070 --> 00:06:09,169
There was a wise man, who was going on a staircase,
and there was a stupid man coming from the

43
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:12,410
other side – foolish man.

44
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:18,569
So foolish people are always aggressive, that
is one of the signs, because they have inferiority

45
00:06:18,569 --> 00:06:20,289
complex.

46
00:06:20,289 --> 00:06:27,160
So the foolish man says to the man who was
coming up, he says – [because] one had to

47
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:32,699
move on one side – so he says, “I don’t
move for fools!”

48
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:36,449
The foolish one says.

49
00:06:36,449 --> 00:06:43,710
So the wise man says, “I do,” and he moved.

50
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:57,021
(Laughter) That’s how the light of innocence
tells you how far to go with a person, how

51
00:06:57,021 --> 00:07:06,719
far to talk to a person, how far to indulge
in another person’s personality or his problems;

52
00:07:06,719 --> 00:07:09,249
otherwise he recedes.

53
00:07:09,249 --> 00:07:14,439
He understands that this gentleman is a stupid
fool so “I move for a fool like that.”

54
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:22,429
He doesn’t pay attention to such a person,
he doesn’t bother about such a person.

55
00:07:22,429 --> 00:07:28,429
This is the light of innocence which gives
you discrimination.

56
00:07:28,429 --> 00:07:29,819
How far to go with others.

57
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:34,219
I love a person, there are many, “I love
him”.

58
00:07:34,219 --> 00:07:35,219
Alright!

59
00:07:35,219 --> 00:07:41,179
The another person may kick you, may hit you,
may trouble you, may become absolutely horribly

60
00:07:41,179 --> 00:07:50,990
possessed, but still you are just mad in love
with that person, without any self-respect.

61
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:57,839
This comes because there is no…you may be
innocent, in a way, in a worldly manner, but

62
00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:00,300
you are not enlightened and innocent.

63
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:07,759
When you are enlightened and innocent then
your innocence is a power, which gives you,

64
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:13,419
first thing, is discretion.

65
00:08:13,419 --> 00:08:20,069
Supposing you take a light in your hand – now
you know whether it is a snake or a rope,

66
00:08:20,069 --> 00:08:24,009
but if there is no light in your hand, you
cannot see.

67
00:08:24,009 --> 00:08:30,379
But even, supposing it’s a snake, you might
run away, or if you are a stupid fool, you’ll

68
00:08:30,379 --> 00:08:31,999
say, “Alright, come and bite me.

69
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:39,410
I would like to see, how it works.”

70
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:44,030
(Child laughs.

71
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:52,650
Laughter) But if you are an enlightened person,
then you will tell the snake, “Now, let

72
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:53,870
me be alone.

73
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:54,870
Alright?

74
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:55,870
Bye-bye.”

75
00:08:55,870 --> 00:09:00,340
(Laughter) And the snake will know and it
will go away.

76
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:08,870
Or if the snake is a sinister one, you may
just look at the snake and snake might run

77
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:10,020
off.

78
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:18,620
So this power of innocence is a very, very
important thing, and that comes to us through

79
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:22,210
our enlightenment alone.

80
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:33,830
So we are, say, in a state which is ignorant
and innocent – innocent and ignorant.

81
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:40,920
Then people are no more innocent nor ignorant,
but they are not enlightened – they become

82
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:41,920
cunning!

83
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:49,640
If they don’t have both the qualities – they
are neither ignorant, so-called, they have

84
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:56,260
got knowledge, they are good at everything,
they are well known people, for their intelligence,

85
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:59,940
brilliance, everything – so they are knowledgeable,
so-called.

86
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:06,840
So such people we could call as the people
who have got the knowledge, in the worldly

87
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:11,850
sense, but they have no innocence.

88
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:17,470
So they start devising methods, the innocence
which is there, which puts a little control

89
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:21,280
over such a mind, is lost.

90
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,240
Because they think innocence is stupid, you
know?

91
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,380
They don’t respect their innocence.

92
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:32,380
So they start manoeuvring people, doing violent
things, doing harmful things, saying nasty,

93
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:33,640
sarcastic things.

94
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:42,310
All these things the brain starts working,
because it cannot get back to its innocence.

95
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:45,770
So we don’t like such people later on, we
don’t want them.

96
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:52,730
Then they develop ideas that, “We are higher
people, we are chosen people, we are better

97
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:55,050
people,” then – they develop all these
ideas.

98
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:58,200
Then they, all of them club together.

99
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:04,420
So ignorance is added as a so-called knowledge,
you see.

100
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:09,030
Inside is completely ignorance, outside is
knowledge.

101
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:16,270
And added up – added up like that, they
do not want to seek their inside.

102
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:24,050
And they are satisfied with their outside,
so-called knowledge.

103
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:29,230
And they go ahead with it, and once they break
their heads, then they realise, “Oh God,

104
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,500
what was it?

105
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:34,690
Inside is all darkness.”

106
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:45,800
We cannot live with all the windows closed
hermetically and the sun shining outside.

107
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:56,400
We have to have light inside, to see for ourselves,
what are we, what are our powers, how far

108
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:07,550
we can go, how we are working out ourselves,
our lives, our aims?

109
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:17,410
Now the enlightenment, as the enlightenment
you see here is of these lights, is manifested

110
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:27,180
within you as vibrations, as chaitanya, as
light.

111
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:32,300
So the chaitanya itself is the light.

112
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:40,310
But the difference between this light and
that light is such that this one will only

113
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:44,930
tell you as far as your eyes are concerned.

114
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:53,090
It will tell you that it is a stone, or it
is a wood, or it is a house, or it is a face

115
00:12:53,090 --> 00:13:03,490
of a man – anything, this light, but it
won’t be able to tell you whether this person

116
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:12,180
is good or bad, whether this house is vibrated
or not, is auspicious or not.

117
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:16,490
So it doesn’t give you auspiciousness, the
idea of auspiciousness.

118
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:22,210
So we are talking of Ganesha’s innocence,
which gives us sense of auspiciousness, and

119
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:28,930
ourselves also makes us auspicious.

120
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:43,130
This is how the chaitanya itself is enlightenment,
chaitanya itself is enlightenment.

121
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:50,000
It relates to you all the knowledge which
it has.

122
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:57,890
Now imagine what a micro-arrangement it is
that the chaitanyas, which are small, small

123
00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:06,670
like, we can say, little round valayas, small,
small ones.

124
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:18,230
They have intelligence in them, and discretion
built-in them to tell you whether a person

125
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:23,200
is good or bad.

126
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:27,310
You have got it, Sahaja Yoga, so in a simple
way.

127
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:33,460
So we have not bothered to find out, what
your computer has got.

128
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:42,900
It has got the knowledge now to know, not
only if the person is good or bad, but what

129
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:46,270
troubles that person has got.

130
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:58,650
Now this light can go up to one dimension
of a person, how he looks, how he walks, everything.

131
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:11,120
And you, if you start imagining something,
if you start imagining – and saying that,

132
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,670
“I feel this way, I think this way.”

133
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:19,900
(somebody interrupts Mother’s talk)

134
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:23,250
Shri Mataji: not all right?

135
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,250
Yogini: [inaudible]

136
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:25,250
Shri Mataji: Ha?

137
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:26,250
Yogini: [inaudible]

138
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,890
Shri Mataji: You can’t hear Me?

139
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:29,210
Many yogis: Yes.

140
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:31,850
Upstairs only in the baby school.

141
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:34,040
Shri Mataji: What is it?

142
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:40,990
Akbar: There is a video for the mothers with
the children, and they can’t hear You.

143
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:43,850
It is upstairs.

144
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:53,080
Shri Mataji: I didn’t hear, what is it?

145
00:15:53,080 --> 00:16:03,060
Antonio Scialo: There is a children-room upstairs,
for children, with a video for children and

146
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,060
mothers.

147
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,060
But they cannot hear it.

148
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,060
Shri Mataji: Oh I see, but the children are
here?

149
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:09,870
Yogis: Babies, babies; mothers and babies.

150
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:12,850
Shri Mataji: Oh God.

151
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:25,540
Somebody has to go up and fix it up, isn’t
it?

152
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:37,050
I think you should have tested it before,
isn’t it?

153
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:38,980
Alright.

154
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:55,430
So, the chaitanya that is within us, which
is flowing out, which we are receiving from

155
00:16:55,430 --> 00:17:13,059
all over, is all-pervading, is in every molecule
pulsating: which gives us knowledge about

156
00:17:13,059 --> 00:17:21,659
each and every matter, each and every animal,
each and every human being, and each and every

157
00:17:21,659 --> 00:17:25,519
Deity.

158
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:36,159
Without this light you could not have recognised
Me.

159
00:17:36,159 --> 00:17:40,750
You could not have recognised any Deities.

160
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:48,250
You could not have known your position in
life and your aims in life.

161
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:54,749
You would not have known what is your purpose
of life, why are you here.

162
00:17:54,749 --> 00:17:58,490
Are you here just to make some money, put
some in the insurance, some in the shares?

163
00:17:58,490 --> 00:17:59,490
Of course, now nobody will do that!

164
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:05,091
(The stock markets crashed on Monday 19 October
1987 the week of this puja) (Laughter) And

165
00:18:05,091 --> 00:18:12,610
get some house, and dance on the fingers of
your wife, or the wife has to dance as the

166
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:21,619
dictates of the husband, to bring up children
somehow – are you here for that?

167
00:18:21,619 --> 00:18:28,499
This chaitanya tells you, very clearly, “No.”

168
00:18:28,499 --> 00:18:40,740
Because if you get more involved into these
things and become completely cut-off from

169
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:47,009
the collective happenings, then this light
goes off.

170
00:18:47,009 --> 00:18:55,529
As soon as this light gets disconnected, you
can’t have any light.

171
00:18:55,529 --> 00:19:10,740
So, any connection, whatever you have, with
the vibrations has to be very strong, and

172
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:13,860
has to be absolutely intact and steady.

173
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:21,190
For example, if there is a light which is
not steady, which is moving, you can’t understand

174
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:24,049
things properly.

175
00:19:24,049 --> 00:19:33,009
Though the vibrations know everything, but
how will they communicate this to an instrument

176
00:19:33,009 --> 00:19:50,179
which is not perfect, which does not respect
vibrations, which does not communicate with

177
00:19:50,179 --> 00:19:54,940
the vibrations?

178
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,690
Please take the child out.

179
00:19:56,690 --> 00:20:01,179
Don’t try to push the – no, no, no, don’t
do that.

180
00:20:01,179 --> 00:20:02,730
No, no, don’t.

181
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:05,340
You should not lose temper with children,
you know?

182
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:22,390
They are crying, they must be wanting something.

183
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:44,659
So, this knowledgeable instrument that you
have got is to be all the time flowing through

184
00:20:44,659 --> 00:20:50,220
you, and you have to be a very clean apparatus.

185
00:20:50,220 --> 00:21:01,250
Supposing you have this light, and the glass
is not clean – you won’t get light properly.

186
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:12,220
So the purity has to be established, and that
is the part, where Ganesha is so important,

187
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:22,279
because He cleanses you, He washes you and
you become innocent: because you do not plan

188
00:21:22,279 --> 00:21:30,919
or think of harming anyone, who is a good
person, who is a nice person.

189
00:21:30,919 --> 00:21:37,070
It becomes innocence because it is auspicious.

190
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:39,360
You start becoming auspicious.

191
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:46,850
Wherever you go, and [if] you meet somebody
that person feels, “Oh God, today something

192
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:49,039
good has happened in our family.

193
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:52,299
Something good has come out.”

194
00:21:52,299 --> 00:21:59,279
Now recently I met someone in Germany where
there was a ‘sahaja yogi’ who started

195
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:02,970
talking against Me and Sahaja Yoga.

196
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:10,289
And he got out of the Ashram, and then he
went to somebody who was supposed to be a

197
00:22:10,289 --> 00:22:15,299
sahaja yogi, and his wife, and there he started
telling about his woes and, against Sahaja

198
00:22:15,299 --> 00:22:17,909
Yoga and all those things.

199
00:22:17,909 --> 00:22:23,249
Though he has been always a possessed man,
but still: these people should not have listened

200
00:22:23,249 --> 00:22:24,940
to anything against Me.

201
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:31,740
In the shastras is written, that: to hear
the Guru-ninda, anything against your Guru,

202
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:34,389
is absolutely dangerous.

203
00:22:34,389 --> 00:22:38,809
So anybody says anything against your Guru,
you have to put your hands like that, “I

204
00:22:38,809 --> 00:22:42,029
don’t want to hear anything against my Guru!”

205
00:22:42,029 --> 00:22:43,460
Instead of that they sympathised.

206
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:52,650
So the lady has got a serious type of cancer,
and the husband is also very sick.

207
00:22:52,650 --> 00:23:02,640
Now, one has to understand that if you are
going to cross this ocean in a boat – all

208
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:10,450
of us are there – and [if] one wants to
put one foot into the mouth of a crocodile,

209
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:12,450
how can we save such people?

210
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:19,110
Then it’s better that they should go to
the crocodile than to the boat.

211
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:27,230
But those who try to sympathise and put another
foot in the crocodile, then they have to be

212
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:34,230
in trouble.

213
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:40,649
All these things not only hamper but are so
inauspicious and dangerous that you all have

214
00:23:40,649 --> 00:23:46,210
to be extremely careful about it.

215
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:48,139
You need not tell people that, “You are
evil!

216
00:23:48,139 --> 00:23:51,989
You are bad!“, or anything – but just
“Get out of Sahaja Yoga!”

217
00:23:51,989 --> 00:23:53,049
Have nothing to do with them.

218
00:23:53,049 --> 00:23:54,460
You should say, “We are sorry.

219
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:56,389
We can’t to anything about it.

220
00:23:56,389 --> 00:23:57,529
You do what you like.

221
00:23:57,529 --> 00:24:00,419
It’s not our responsibility.”

222
00:24:00,419 --> 00:24:06,720
And there you should not be meek, you should
not feel embarrassed or delicate about it.

223
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,809
Tell them off, “Nothing doing.

224
00:24:08,809 --> 00:24:16,490
We cannot help you here, we are sorry, you
work it out yourself.”

225
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:25,330
Because this light is a light which nourishes
you and strengthens you.

226
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:31,230
The light of the Spirit must give you that
strength within you.

227
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:34,200
You become a strong personality.

228
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:44,059
You become a personality which can withstand
lots of things, even crucifixion, but it can

229
00:24:44,059 --> 00:24:46,149
also fight.

230
00:24:46,149 --> 00:24:53,250
It has all the qualities built within itself.

231
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:56,429
Like a person who has a temper.

232
00:24:56,429 --> 00:24:57,429
No!

233
00:24:57,429 --> 00:24:59,919
It’s not a very good person to be, with
temper.

234
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:03,529
It’s not good for a Sahaja Yogi to have
temper.

235
00:25:03,529 --> 00:25:09,850
But if somebody says something to you against
your Mother, you have to have temper.

236
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:13,559
That’s the place we have to use temper.

237
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:17,580
You can box that person, doesn’t matter.

238
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:24,220
(Laughter) Ganesha will be just standing behind
you.

239
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:30,400
(Laughter) And Hanumana will be in front.

240
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:36,789
(Laughter) If you box him once, Hanumana will
box him ten times.

241
00:25:36,789 --> 00:25:44,179
(Laughter) So that time the anger has meaning.

242
00:25:44,179 --> 00:25:54,149
Now, people say, one should not have greed
in life.

243
00:25:54,149 --> 00:26:01,029
Yes, one should not have greed, but if you
have got greed for vibrations it’s a very

244
00:26:01,029 --> 00:26:02,690
good thing.

245
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:05,549
You should be very greedy about vibrations.

246
00:26:05,549 --> 00:26:11,399
Wherever you get vibrations, you must rush
and try to get more vibrations.

247
00:26:11,399 --> 00:26:18,250
Greed is alright, you should have that greed
within yourself.

248
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:25,929
If you don’t have that greed, how will you
be able to overcome the other attractions?

249
00:26:25,929 --> 00:26:30,129
It is very surprising, I always wonder about
human beings – which I’ve never been able

250
00:26:30,129 --> 00:26:32,980
to understand Myself.

251
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:44,330
(Laughter) That, when it comes to hatred they
are the best!

252
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:53,090
If they want to hate someone then you can
make them sacrifice everything that they have.

253
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:59,090
Under the name of God, under the name of nation,
under the name of anything whatever you want.

254
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:02,270
You just have to say that, “We have to hate
someone.”

255
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:09,100
Immediately they’ll gather around, they’ll
pass trough all kinds of ordeals, sacrifice

256
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:18,169
everything, go to jails, they will kill themselves,
commit suicides – just if you tell them,

257
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:20,769
“We hate someone.”

258
00:27:20,769 --> 00:27:27,529
Or else you have to say that, “We are a
great nation, something very big and, these

259
00:27:27,529 --> 00:27:32,950
are bad nations – so we have to fight.”

260
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:38,749
They will do.

261
00:27:38,749 --> 00:27:46,519
It is very surprising that, even when it comes
to political revolutions and for their political

262
00:27:46,519 --> 00:27:54,129
freedom, they can go to any limit of sacrifices.

263
00:27:54,129 --> 00:27:56,419
The other day I was watching Lenin’s fight.

264
00:27:56,419 --> 00:27:57,710
I was amazed!

265
00:27:57,710 --> 00:28:05,749
This single man Lenin, who was always in the
exile used to only write, “We have to fight,

266
00:28:05,749 --> 00:28:08,100
we have to get this, we have to do that.”

267
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:14,929
Though he was a realised soul, but still he
didn’t write about spirituality, he wrote

268
00:28:14,929 --> 00:28:22,039
about political struggle, and three times
there was an upsurge and thousands and thousands

269
00:28:22,039 --> 00:28:32,210
of people you find in every place being killed
– just like that.

270
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:33,210
It is very surprising.

271
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:41,260
Now, don’t fan, you see, while I am talking
you should not fan, you know, it disturbs.

272
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:46,190
Pay full attention; pay full attention, is
important.

273
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:52,940
Because if you do not pay attention, others
will look at you, and their attention will

274
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:53,940
be spoiled.

275
00:28:53,940 --> 00:29:01,720
Now this one was so dedicated, even little
children and wives and pregnant women and

276
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:06,769
so many men were killed in a lot like that.

277
00:29:06,769 --> 00:29:12,559
Again they rose, again they rose three times,
and the fourth time they were successful.

278
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:15,490
For what?

279
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:19,299
For a political achievement.

280
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:24,049
We did that in India, too.

281
00:29:24,049 --> 00:29:29,080
People gave up everything that they have,
their houses, families – everything they

282
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:31,080
gave up.

283
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:37,669
Even for fake gurus people have spent so much
money, they have done so much, given up everything,

284
00:29:37,669 --> 00:29:42,190
sold their houses, put their children into
trouble, got into trouble – everything they

285
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:43,320
did.

286
00:29:43,320 --> 00:30:01,000
But for the right thing, the wisest thing,
the only great thing that has to happen is

287
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:08,119
Sahaja Yoga – where comfort is pouring on
us all the time, where all kinds of joy is

288
00:30:08,119 --> 00:30:19,570
pouring on us, where everything is being smoothed
out for you – people become so fond of comfort,

289
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:27,739
and this and that, that the slightest sacrifice
they can’t understand.

290
00:30:27,739 --> 00:30:32,829
They’ll come with problems about their wives,
about their children, about their husbands

291
00:30:32,829 --> 00:30:34,029
– everything solved.

292
00:30:34,029 --> 00:30:37,350
Now this goes on and on and on and on.

293
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:38,590
Solve them!

294
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:39,679
Finish them off!

295
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:41,729
Cut them short!

296
00:30:41,729 --> 00:30:45,940
You have to spread Sahaja Yoga!

297
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:51,359
You have to sacrifice some time, you have
to sacrifice some money also.

298
00:30:51,359 --> 00:30:56,429
Who is going to work it out?

299
00:30:56,429 --> 00:31:05,520
Nobody is going to kill you, as people were
killed in Russia, or in Germany, or in Poland.

300
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:10,239
Nobody is going to take away your children
or to take away your money, or anything – no

301
00:31:10,239 --> 00:31:14,320
one wants it.

302
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:22,260
But this light in your hand has to be burnt
with the true desire, the pure desire within

303
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:26,090
you, is the Kundalini.

304
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:34,279
That is the wick, that is the one has to be
kept absolutely nourished.

305
00:31:34,279 --> 00:31:37,940
And that is where sahaja yogis fail.

306
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:40,779
People don’t want to leave Sahaja Yoga.

307
00:31:40,779 --> 00:31:43,199
Even if you tell them, “Please go away,
we can’t help!”

308
00:31:43,199 --> 00:31:44,959
– “No, no, no, I cannot leave Sahaja Yoga.”

309
00:31:44,959 --> 00:31:45,959
– “Why?”

310
00:31:45,959 --> 00:31:47,049
Because is a place of enjoyment.

311
00:31:47,049 --> 00:31:56,629
But it would be something different from human
beings, because human beings, if a human being

312
00:31:56,629 --> 00:32:04,700
gets a bottle of wine he’ll call ten more
to enjoy it.

313
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:11,700
If a dog gets something to eat he’ll call
other dogs to eat it.

314
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:16,320
If a crow gets something to eat he’ll call
other crows to eat it.

315
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,909
Naturally built within them.

316
00:32:18,909 --> 00:32:21,509
Same with human beings.

317
00:32:21,509 --> 00:32:28,289
But when it comes to Sahaja Yoga we are not
that tenacious about it.

318
00:32:28,289 --> 00:32:32,979
We have to tell all our relations, “We are
Sahaja Yogis, and this is the religion of

319
00:32:32,979 --> 00:32:37,489
within, and this is what it is – if you
don’t want to follow I have nothing to do

320
00:32:37,489 --> 00:32:38,489
with you.

321
00:32:38,489 --> 00:32:40,139
Why don’t you follow it?”

322
00:32:40,139 --> 00:32:41,799
Everybody has got relations.

323
00:32:41,799 --> 00:32:50,840
So on a Diwali day, when we were talking about
our light, what are we going to do with this

324
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:51,840
light?

325
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,929
Are we going to use it only for our own purpose?

326
00:32:54,929 --> 00:33:05,289
Christ has said, you don’t put the light
under a – what you call it?

327
00:33:05,289 --> 00:33:06,499
– measure.

328
00:33:06,499 --> 00:33:11,629
You don’t put it under a measure.

329
00:33:11,629 --> 00:33:14,639
You put it on a table.

330
00:33:14,639 --> 00:33:18,200
We all have to come out in the public, we
have to find out ways and methods.

331
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:24,260
It’s not only the leaders, everybody has
to work it out what we can do to spread Sahaja

332
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:25,260
Yoga.

333
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:29,190
In every place you go: how can we give Sahaja
Yoga?

334
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:34,460
Of course I don’t want you to change your
dresses – but you can carry big badges.

335
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:35,460
People will ask you.

336
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:42,470
You should say, “Yes, this is the person
who has given us peace, joy and happiness.”

337
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:47,409
Start talking like that, go to the markets,
go to public places.

338
00:33:47,409 --> 00:33:56,710
I go to market just to spread vibrations – you
all have to do that, otherwise you will have

339
00:33:56,710 --> 00:34:01,409
the Sahaja Yoga enjoyment to yourself , but
unless and until you share it you are not

340
00:34:01,409 --> 00:34:03,179
going to enjoy it fully.

341
00:34:03,179 --> 00:34:04,909
Look at Me.

342
00:34:04,909 --> 00:34:09,340
I have all the vibrations of the world.

343
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:17,800
(Laughter) I have everything, I should be
such a self-contented person, sitting at home

344
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:22,440
– in meditation.

345
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:28,150
(Laughter) At this age, why should I travel
after all?

346
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:35,260
(Laughter) I am the Adi Shakti – why should
I worry of making everybody such a powerful

347
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:37,179
shakti people?

348
00:34:37,179 --> 00:34:40,690
There’s no need.

349
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:50,502
I should enjoy My powers, I can, but I cannot.

350
00:34:50,502 --> 00:34:52,460
I have to work hard.

351
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:56,970
I give the maximum time to Sahaja Yoga, than
any one of you can give.

352
00:34:56,970 --> 00:35:01,910
I have a family, I have got My husband.

353
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:04,610
He has a life which is very, very busy life.

354
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:06,300
I’ve got grandchildren.

355
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:08,740
I give the maximum time.

356
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:13,320
Now see, from here to Rome, then to France,
then to Spain.

357
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:16,750
You all are having just a relay race.

358
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:21,180
Alright, I am here – Italians are having
a little strain.

359
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:24,680
Then they will relax!

360
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:27,720
“Now alright…”

361
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:32,480
(Laughter) Then, what do I do?

362
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:36,910
All the year round I am going from places
to places…travelling.

363
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:41,950
And when I have everything.

364
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:53,280
Can you think of a rich man who is busy distributing
all the wealth he has, while the others take

365
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,680
time to take it?

366
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,490
That is what it is.

367
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:07,410
So I have to tell you that you have to come
in a new dimension of your enthusiasm.

368
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:11,680
Sahaja Yoga is not for our enjoyment alone.

369
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,420
“We are saints,” so what!

370
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:14,510
For what?

371
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:16,800
For what you are made saints?

372
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:21,250
It’s not that the men should only do, or
women should do, or this one should do, or

373
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:23,090
that one should do.

374
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:29,500
Don’t get involved into these temptations.

375
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:36,130
There are thirteen temptations, which came
out of the churning.

376
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:44,710
The fourteenth one was a big hunter to neutralise
all the thirteen.

377
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:53,030
Not that Sahaja Yoga wants to tempt anyone,
but they become temptations because they are

378
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:57,560
blessings to you, and blessings you start
using as temptations.

379
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:10,370
Now, for anybody, to have such a temptation
would be more like a horse, which has to go

380
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:18,250
to the south or to the north, is standing
and eating the grass.

381
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:24,780
You have to move, movement is the point, you
have to move from places to places, you have

382
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:29,320
to go from villages to villages, you have
to go from houses to houses.

383
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:32,000
This message has to spread.

384
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:37,450
Christ’s twelve disciples only – how much
religion they have created?

385
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:42,960
Of course, it’s of no use, but still!

386
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:46,330
You are going to give something so substantial
and so great.

387
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:49,560
But when you tell them, then the way you tell
them is important.

388
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:56,270
The way you assert is important.

389
00:37:56,270 --> 00:38:00,370
I don’t mind from today – you can tell
them what I am.

390
00:38:00,370 --> 00:38:01,610
Doesn’t matter.

391
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:03,180
How long are we going to hide it?

392
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:07,910
You better tell them that, “She is such
and such, it’s written in the Bible, She

393
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:09,500
is such and such – we have found it.

394
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:12,710
If you don’t want to see it, don’t see
it – but it is so.”

395
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:23,290
Let’s have that determination and let’s
have that kind of a outspokenness.

396
00:38:23,290 --> 00:38:25,630
Look at these horrible politicians.

397
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:32,060
They say, “I believe that there should be
some people who should be rich, the rest should

398
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:33,060
be poor.

399
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,760
I believe.

400
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:37,260
I believe in this and I believe in that.”

401
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:38,800
What about you?

402
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:43,170
You do not only believe, but you know for
definite!

403
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:54,330
And that’s what should be decided on a Diwali
day that by next Diwali we have to get many,

404
00:38:54,330 --> 00:38:55,960
many people for Sahaja Yoga.

405
00:38:55,960 --> 00:39:01,400
But when I speak, many people told Me that
they think I am not speaking to them [but]

406
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:04,210
to somebody else.

407
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:09,330
You should see to the people who are working
harder than you for Sahaja Yoga; who are involved

408
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:14,240
more in Sahaja Yoga; those who are achieving
more in Sahaja Yoga – not the people who

409
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:16,630
have done nothing.

410
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:19,990
You can see Me.

411
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:26,310
What are we doing?

412
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:29,810
You should think about it.

413
00:39:29,810 --> 00:39:33,510
Where are we?

414
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:37,540
This is the most important period.

415
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:42,250
At the most, in Europe, I will be for five
years more, at the most.

416
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:49,180
Do you think I’ll be travelling after seventy
years of age?

417
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:52,220
No.

418
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:57,500
So this is such an important time when I am
here, then I could meet people, I could talk

419
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:00,310
to them, I can help you a lot.

420
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:02,860
In these five years you have to achieve something.

421
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:08,390
And you have to take a jump and give a speed
to yourself.

422
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:14,990
Otherwise this is a very important time, will
be lost by all your fellow men.

423
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:17,420
Like the other day we had program.

424
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:22,290
I’ll tell you a practical side: now what,
I would do [is] take the addresses of all

425
00:40:22,290 --> 00:40:30,150
the people who got realisation, take it down,
write to them, go and see them, meet them.

426
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:33,070
[Find out] what has happened, why didn’t
they come.

427
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:39,830
Then make a statement, why people didn’t
come, what happened, why is he not coming.

428
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:42,900
Write to them all the time.

429
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:48,170
See you’ll be surprised if you take one
copy of ‘Reader’s Digest‘ (Magazine),

430
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:51,250
only once – make a mistake.

431
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:59,320
(Laughter) – they go on sending you so many
types of things, you know?

432
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:05,330
(Laughter) You will get this present, you’ll
get – this is a car free for you, this thing

433
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:06,330
for you.

434
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:07,330
Who wants it?

435
00:41:07,330 --> 00:41:08,390
But they go on sending.

436
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:10,900
I have written to them, “Don’t send Me
anything.

437
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:11,900
I don’t want any car – nothing.

438
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:15,600
You just send Me Reader’s Digest, thank
you very much.

439
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:18,580
I’m not a lucky person.

440
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:20,960
Please don’t send.”

441
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:24,140
Still they are sending!

442
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:25,730
(Laughter & applause)

443
00:41:25,730 --> 00:41:29,620
In this way you must write to them all the
time, “Why are you not coming to Mother?

444
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:31,680
Why you are not coming to Sahaja Yoga?

445
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:35,480
Sahaja Yoga is so important, it has given
me so much, why don’t you want to have it?”

446
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:39,340
You must show that earnestness within you.

447
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:44,770
And if you do not show that earnestness – take
it in a mundane way, “Alright, it’s going

448
00:41:44,770 --> 00:41:48,500
well, this, that, is good, alright, this is
improving, that is.”

449
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:51,610
That’s not the way you are going to work
it out!

450
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:56,720
Once I go to India I know in India it will
take no time.

451
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:00,950
India will work out very fast.

452
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:09,900
And you have to book your seats in the heaven,
that’s very important.

453
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:17,290
I mean, even for an aeroplane you have to
book a seat; then what about heaven?

454
00:42:17,290 --> 00:42:21,170
(Laughter) And so many have to book the seats.

455
00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:27,250
If all Indians are sitting there, what will
you do?

456
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:31,160
(Laughter)

457
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:39,790
So with this joy, with this happiness, with
this light on our face, with this beauty of

458
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:43,780
enlightenment you are all gurus.

459
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:47,770
Imagine, these useless [false] gurus know
nothing, their Kundalini is not awakened,

460
00:42:47,770 --> 00:42:51,560
nothing of that kind – and how much they
have built up their empires after empires.

461
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:58,500
I don’t say that you build up empires, no,
not that way, but why not build up at least

462
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:06,570
a hut to show that you have achieved something
and it has to be done.

463
00:43:06,570 --> 00:43:10,770
Talk to everyone in your office, in your this
thing, not to feel shy.

464
00:43:10,770 --> 00:43:15,020
I have seen people put up these horrible peoples’
photographs everywhere.

465
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:19,710
In their office you go, you find them; in
the buses you find them; everywhere they are

466
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:20,710
hanging.

467
00:43:20,710 --> 00:43:23,230
Why not My photograph?

468
00:43:23,230 --> 00:43:28,620
So the curiosity is there, people will ask
you, you tell them – it will work out.

469
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:31,790
The best thing is working out in Italy, surprisingly.

470
00:43:31,790 --> 00:43:37,010
And it will go ahead, because we found some
very good people and you should try to find

471
00:43:37,010 --> 00:43:39,330
out.

472
00:43:39,330 --> 00:43:43,320
Such people who are around – get after them
and work it out.

473
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:47,440
But don’t go to wrong people, must use your
discretion.

474
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:52,340
You know how these [false] gurus work – is
very important.

475
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:57,670
My brother was telling Me that a lady from
this Muktananda – now the Muktananda is

476
00:43:57,670 --> 00:44:02,540
not there, there is another American girl,
American-styled Indian girl.

477
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:10,040
So, this Muktananda lady (disciple), one English
lady came to his house, My brother’s house

478
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:13,490
– and she was very sweet, “I want to see
you, Sir,” – this, that.

479
00:44:13,490 --> 00:44:14,960
And she saw My photograph.

480
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:17,360
So she said, “What is this Mataji doing
here?”

481
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:18,360
He said, “Why?

482
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:20,050
She is my sister.”

483
00:44:20,050 --> 00:44:24,410
She just bundled up everything and ran away.

484
00:44:24,410 --> 00:44:27,560
So My brother called her, “Please, come
along, sit down, sit down.

485
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:28,560
What do you do?”

486
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:33,690
She said, “No Sir, we see – we always
go and meet all the important people of the

487
00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:36,500
city, talk to them about it.”

488
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:39,030
He said, “Yes.”

489
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:42,360
And all the judges’ names were on the list.

490
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:45,490
Immediately My brother took the telephone
and told them, “Have nothing to do with

491
00:44:45,490 --> 00:44:47,850
this woman!”

492
00:44:47,850 --> 00:44:51,580
But this is what it is.

493
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:53,910
You should find out how to approach people.

494
00:44:53,910 --> 00:44:57,750
When I am there, there are – say – 200
people.

495
00:44:57,750 --> 00:44:59,490
When I go away, there are only 2 people.

496
00:44:59,490 --> 00:45:00,490
Why?

497
00:45:00,490 --> 00:45:01,490
What is the matter?

498
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:03,940
Why they go away?

499
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:06,790
There must be some reason.

500
00:45:06,790 --> 00:45:10,020
They don’t know Me.

501
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:12,470
At least get their addresses.

502
00:45:12,470 --> 00:45:14,270
Find out who are these people.

503
00:45:14,270 --> 00:45:20,060
There’s no harm in getting their addresses
and finding out who they are.

504
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:27,140
Then put them on the list and go on sending
letters to them, if not so much like Reader’s

505
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:31,460
Digest, but something.

506
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:36,700
When you will start sending letters to them,
you will be entered into their ignorance.

507
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:39,600
The light will go in.

508
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:43,810
Through your movement, your attention, the
light will go.

509
00:45:43,810 --> 00:45:47,660
You don’t know your attention, how powerful
it is.

510
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:51,350
Once you start paying attention to them, the
light will pass through them.

511
00:45:51,350 --> 00:45:55,520
If not today, tomorrow they’ll come round.

512
00:45:55,520 --> 00:46:00,300
You can also send My photograph, “Try on
the photograph, this is the photograph, you

513
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:02,410
came to the program, we are very happy.”

514
00:46:02,410 --> 00:46:07,900
Now if the follow-on doesn’t work out, try
this thing.

515
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:14,900
And that’s the best way you can achieve
sometimes, but it is for you to think and

516
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:19,120
understand – because you are human beings
and you know human beings.

517
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:25,660
You just put yourself in the position of another
person – what would have appealed to you?

518
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:35,630
There’s another thing I feel that people
should write books about Me.

519
00:46:35,630 --> 00:46:36,630
There’s no harm.

520
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:40,760
But about Me, write the book about Me.

521
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:46,040
But some people, who have a name, who have
in the society some name, who will be taken

522
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:51,980
up seriously – they can write a book about
Me.

523
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:56,190
They write books about everyone, why can’t
you write a book about Me?

524
00:46:56,190 --> 00:47:00,640
Not about, you can write about Sahaja Yoga
in it – of course, but you can write about

525
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:01,640
Me.

526
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:06,240
Telling people of such and such person is
there, and this is the solution, this is the

527
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,240
hope.

528
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:08,240
Why not?

529
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:12,030
They write about all these horrible gurus,
why can’t you write about Me?

530
00:47:12,030 --> 00:47:16,650
But the person has to be a well known person.

531
00:47:16,650 --> 00:47:25,000
Now supposing you write a book, somebody else
can publish in his name – if you are a good

532
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
writer.

533
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,290
Somebody else can edit it and publish it.

534
00:47:28,290 --> 00:47:30,190
We can do that way.

535
00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:36,190
There are so many ways and methods by which
you can bring to the notice of the people

536
00:47:36,190 --> 00:47:37,670
that this is Sahaja Yoga.

537
00:47:37,670 --> 00:47:40,760
How many people know about Sahaja Yoga?

538
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:45,660
A person comes out of jail, from India, walks
out and here it is.

539
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:55,400
Very well known ‘guru’ sitting in some
corner of some dirty lane in America somewhere,

540
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:56,800
and is a very well known person.

541
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:08,930
They are all very well known – how?

542
00:48:08,930 --> 00:48:14,180
And it is not always that these things are
done through money, they are done through

543
00:48:14,180 --> 00:48:19,490
people doing their own deliberation.

544
00:48:19,490 --> 00:48:24,410
But these deliberations may be mesmerising,
bhootish, I agree.

545
00:48:24,410 --> 00:48:29,380
I do understand that you are free people,
to do what you like, but in your freedom you

546
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:31,560
have to realise.

547
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:36,370
And this is what today you all have to decide
that this is the light we have got, this has

548
00:48:36,370 --> 00:48:43,810
to be made into a beacon, not just a light,
a tinted light like that; what’s the use?

549
00:48:43,810 --> 00:48:47,820
We have to be like a beautiful tower of light.

550
00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:53,170
Like a lighthouse.

551
00:48:53,170 --> 00:48:57,050
And everybody should work it out within and
without.

552
00:48:57,050 --> 00:48:59,950
Within though you have worked out, without
you must work now.

553
00:48:59,950 --> 00:49:04,510
And secondly there’s a deepawali, it is
not only one light.

554
00:49:04,510 --> 00:49:08,120
So we have to be all collective, try to get
to collective life.

555
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:13,280
Whenever it is possible, try to attend all
that is collective; try to be there, where

556
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:14,480
there is collective happenings.

557
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:20,250
There, where it is collective, this source
of energy flows better.

558
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:24,590
May God bless you all!
