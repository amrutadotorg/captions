WEBVTT

00:00.858 --> 00:04.198
Now the question he asked me

00:04.921 --> 00:09.666
was in the nature of a entire of a person

00:10.881 --> 00:19.003
who wants to find out, what is the proof that there is God.

00:20.801 --> 00:26.601
I How are we to convince people, what is God?

00:27.402 --> 00:33.007
That we have to achieve something, as far as God is concerned?

00:33.890 --> 00:38.906
How are we to convince them
that we have got all these centers within us

00:40.806 --> 00:44.021
and that you have to achieve that realization?

00:44.236 --> 00:46.989
And also how are we to prove to others that

00:47.165 --> 00:49.565
you have achieved your realization?

00:53.673 --> 00:55.856
This is the question

00:56.521 --> 01:00.544
which everyone who is not yet a fully Sahaja Yogi

01:01.091 --> 01:04.567
would feel and ask you questions and you should all

01:04.841 --> 01:06.345
answers to it.

01:09.522 --> 01:12.026
The first and foremost question is

01:12.182 --> 01:14.516
how do we prove that there is God?

01:18.610 --> 01:20.769
Because you assumed that there is God

01:20.870 --> 01:23.670
because somebody has said, “There is God.”

01:24.921 --> 01:29.747
Now what are the ways of proving this that there is God?

01:33.475 --> 01:35.808
So we have to attack the question,

01:38.105 --> 01:40.543
first from the reasoning point of you

01:40.733 --> 01:45.570
that we should be able to tell people that there is God

01:46.296 --> 01:49.789
through reason not through experiencing

01:50.001 --> 01:52.201
because they are to be prepared.

01:54.756 --> 01:58.429
There will be many who really do not believe

01:58.662 --> 02:02.759
in God but just out of fashion they’re saying “All right we accept”

02:02.927 --> 02:07.295
because they want to keep up peace and the compromise.

02:08.824 --> 02:15.782
But how you start about convincing them rationally?

02:16.027 --> 02:18.499
Perhaps I spoke in one of My lectures if you have that,

02:18.600 --> 02:20.800
I don’t know if you have got it.

02:21.981 --> 02:26.830
But we can prove it – the existence of God.

02:28.996 --> 02:32.132
You may call it God or nature or whatever it is,

02:32.668 --> 02:34.348
from many point of view.

02:35.179 --> 02:37.731
For example in short we can say,

02:37.843 --> 02:41.235
“There are many scientific things we cannot explain”.

02:45.923 --> 02:50.469
We cannot explain how the periodic laws were established

02:51.307 --> 02:53.307
without somebody being there.

02:57.144 --> 03:01.239
Periodic laws of chemical substances

03:01.631 --> 03:07.155
of the elements that exist on this Earth is so regular

03:07.276 --> 03:09.122
and so properly plotted down

03:09.234 --> 03:11.075
that you can see there must be some plotter

03:11.209 --> 03:13.385
otherwise it cannot be done.

03:13.575 --> 03:16.967
I mean if you want to avoid it,
you can avoid it but there must be someone.

03:17.101 --> 03:18.834
Say we come in this room

03:18.932 --> 03:21.436
and find everything properly organized,

03:21.570 --> 03:25.730
lit up and we should know there must be somebody who has done it.

03:29.249 --> 03:36.518
Then a very good example is given by a very good French biologist,

03:37.813 --> 03:41.835
he says that if you use law of chance,

03:42.338 --> 03:46.980
the law of chance states that

03:47.438 --> 03:52.247
– if you have got fifty red pebbles and fifty white pebbles

03:52.806 --> 03:56.984
put in a jar and if you shake that jar

03:57.342 --> 03:59.475
it goes into a chaotic condition

04:00.741 --> 04:07.776
and the distribution of these pebbles is in a chaotic manner.

04:10.500 --> 04:15.247
To bring them back to their normal condition of having the red

04:15.683 --> 04:18.583
on one side and the white on the other side,

04:20.125 --> 04:24.042
you go on shaking it as many times as you like

04:24.645 --> 04:26.912
and they have found out – there’s

04:27.047 --> 04:30.311
minimum of minimum so many times it has to be done

04:31.221 --> 04:34.178
otherwise it cannot be worked out.

04:35.528 --> 04:37.395
This is all done by chance.

04:37.527 --> 04:41.303
You see by chance when it has to come to normal condition.

04:43.039 --> 04:45.372
How many chances you have to take?

04:45.551 --> 04:48.151
There’s a certain amount of a formula.

04:48.274 --> 04:51.141
Something raised to power ‘n’, call it ‘n’.

04:53.620 --> 04:57.314
So as a biologist he tried to calculate

04:57.504 --> 05:02.001
that if matter has to become living,

05:05.652 --> 05:07.518
then to get to that density

05:10.730 --> 05:13.475
how many years are required

05:16.321 --> 05:22.431
by the law of chance to bring forth a living cell – one cell?

05:24.262 --> 05:28.550
And he found out that billions and billions and billions of years,

05:32.510 --> 05:35.377
if this law of chance works out

05:35.713 --> 05:39.540
then only one unicellular animal can be created.

05:41.762 --> 05:48.589
But in this short time from when the Earth receded from

05:49.326 --> 05:56.881
the Sun and then cooled down and then life came into being,

05:57.056 --> 06:00.307
then human being were created who are very complicated,

06:00.460 --> 06:02.719
it is such a short time,

06:03.031 --> 06:06.067
compared to that time which is required by chance.

06:06.190 --> 06:09.969
That he has proved mathematically that it is an impossibility,

06:10.093 --> 06:11.533
it cannot happen.

06:13.385 --> 06:15.065
It is that fantastic.

06:16.097 --> 06:19.425
This is a scientific very good proof of a biologist

06:19.601 --> 06:23.313
that there is somebody, a juggler, who is doing that job.

06:23.574 --> 06:25.058
You may call Him ‘God’;

06:25.171 --> 06:29.075
you may call Him ‘Nature’ whatever is, but the nature thinks.

06:30.740 --> 06:32.760
People like Yung have proved

06:32.883 --> 06:35.683
the existence of collective consciousness.

06:36.142 --> 06:40.310
The existence of unconscious, which gives us dreams

06:41.047 --> 06:46.928
through which we get universal symbols.

06:48.815 --> 06:53.295
All over the world whether we are in India
or in England or anywhere.

06:53.625 --> 06:55.770
The symbols are the same

06:56.239 --> 06:59.695
and he has done experiments with thousands of people.

07:00.346 --> 07:03.013
On the medical science also one can say

07:03.772 --> 07:08.270
as you know that one of the arguments we put in for is that

07:09.787 --> 07:12.482
acetylene and adrenaline

07:13.632 --> 07:17.728
which are two chemicals when they are in the body – human body,

07:18.007 --> 07:19.993
they act very arbitrarily.

07:20.161 --> 07:22.682
Means they have to augment

07:23.051 --> 07:25.718
– mean to contract or to relax.

07:25.942 --> 07:29.691
Those who relax must relax;
those who have to contract must contract.

07:29.882 --> 07:32.783
But those who are supposed to be contracting relax,

07:32.895 --> 07:36.845
while those who are supposed to be relaxing contract.

07:36.980 --> 07:40.517
So they have not been able to explain and they have written,

07:40.607 --> 07:44.956
all of the doctors, they say that the mode of conduct of these

07:45.157 --> 07:48.059
chemicals in the body one cannot say.

07:48.829 --> 07:56.880
Another thing is that one of the very very important

07:57.048 --> 07:59.782
arguments that people have given is this

07:59.894 --> 08:05.506
that supposing a foreign body goes inside the human body,

08:05.773 --> 08:09.805
there’s always a tendency to throw it out as soon as possible.

08:09.960 --> 08:13.051
Supposing something goes into your throat, you cough out.

08:13.207 --> 08:16.089
Supposing something goes in the blood,
they will try to throw it away.

08:16.291 --> 08:21.760
That’s the system it is. But when the fetus is formed in the body,

08:23.557 --> 08:27.461
then not only it is kept there, it is nurtured, looked after

08:27.656 --> 08:29.923
and thrown out at the right time.

08:32.946 --> 08:34.679
How can you explain that?

08:34.844 --> 08:36.908
There are thousand and one explanations

08:37.054 --> 08:40.894
people have tried to give but none of them are satisfactory.

08:41.164 --> 08:44.289
Then this Earth is spinning with such a speed

08:44.569 --> 08:48.698
and we are kept glued to this Earth, we never even feel the speed.

08:48.877 --> 08:50.811
And so many things like that

08:50.975 --> 08:54.559
people have been able to say and the so many scientists

08:55.219 --> 09:00.308
have felt that, there is some force

09:00.887 --> 09:03.687
which is beyond us which is very dynamic,

09:03.835 --> 09:07.355
which acts in such dynamic ways that we cannot explain.

09:08.284 --> 09:11.498
So we come to a point where we tell people

09:11.597 --> 09:15.318
that there is some force which we have to discover.

09:17.751 --> 09:22.636
Now then as Sahaja Yogis you can say that this hankering to seek.

09:24.219 --> 09:27.185
After a certain level of evolution because

09:27.354 --> 09:30.100
some people do not have a thirst seeking, you know that.

09:30.234 --> 09:33.754
They are just seeking food – to eat just like animals.

09:33.895 --> 09:35.962
Some people are seeking power.

09:37.545 --> 09:39.945
Some people are seeking money also.

09:40.569 --> 09:45.439
But there are so many people who are seeking something beyond.

09:45.942 --> 09:48.363
This seeking has come to us

09:51.433 --> 09:53.899
and this seeking that has come to us

09:54.223 --> 10:00.722
has led us to some sort of a path by which we should find out.

10:01.738 --> 10:06.282
Now you have seen with your naked eyes,
a Kundalini rising at My Feet.

10:06.425 --> 10:09.325
You have seen the pulsation of the Kundalini

10:09.455 --> 10:11.522
definitely that nobody can do.

10:11.765 --> 10:13.899
There is no mesmerism, nothing.

10:17.435 --> 10:20.507
When the Kundalini rises, with the stethoscope

10:20.598 --> 10:23.331
you can feel the rising of the Kundalini.

10:23.542 --> 10:26.712
With the rising of Kundalini you have known that

10:26.858 --> 10:28.922
we have cured people of different diseases.

10:29.084 --> 10:31.155
Even a person who was just dying,

10:31.301 --> 10:34.168
whom doctor had decided that they are dead

10:34.605 --> 10:38.195
and to be buried very soon, have been cured.

10:41.008 --> 10:45.232
And it is so dynamic, the dynamism I’ll tell you. It’s so dynamic

10:45.764 --> 10:49.626
– like we can take the case of Eddy’s? brother.

10:51.042 --> 10:54.105
That he was so very sick and they said,

10:54.306 --> 10:57.543
“He has got blood cancer, he’s going to die within eight days”.

10:57.689 --> 11:02.621
I mean he just told Me this, that’s all and he’s cured.

11:03.548 --> 11:07.644
Then Linda told Me that her mother was always angry with Peter.

11:09.805 --> 11:17.650
[Mother speaks aside – “Where is she gone? Where is she? Linda!”]

11:23.922 --> 11:27.218
– So she told Me that

11:27.397 --> 11:29.615
the mother would never talk to Peter,

11:29.705 --> 11:32.629
she was very angry with him always, she would never talk to him.

11:32.819 --> 11:37.707
But she told Me all these things

11:37.896 --> 11:40.832
and suddenly she found that now she’s become very good

11:40.955 --> 11:43.355
and congenial and nice and talking.

11:45.107 --> 11:47.907
You have seen such transformations coming

11:48.403 --> 11:50.469
among many, many, many people.

11:50.605 --> 11:53.388
How people are changing, transforming,

11:53.525 --> 11:56.475
this is absolutely dynamic; you cannot do it.

11:59.143 --> 12:01.743
So many sick people are suddenly cured

12:02.324 --> 12:04.524
only through attention you know.

12:08.540 --> 12:11.196
There must be something about it

12:11.888 --> 12:14.355
and that is how you have to convince

12:20.423 --> 12:23.402
people about Sahaja.

12:24.731 --> 12:26.731
But after getting realization

12:27.575 --> 12:31.577
you just see the Kundalini, you see the rising of the Kundalini.

12:31.784 --> 12:35.628
You also feel the vibrating force of Kundalini.

12:36.376 --> 12:38.509
You also see how you got cured,

12:39.278 --> 12:41.544
how you got out of your problems?

12:43.348 --> 12:50.644
How you were in trouble? What problems you had?

12:51.902 --> 12:53.902
You had seen all these things

12:56.318 --> 12:58.718
and these things happen to you also.

12:59.084 --> 13:02.074
Some of you were drug addicts,

13:02.445 --> 13:05.548
some of you were suffering from some mental troubles.

13:05.671 --> 13:08.071
Some were having physical problems.

13:08.258 --> 13:13.648
All these, you see, are cured and you are much better people now.

13:17.320 --> 13:19.936
This has happened to you very easily

13:20.059 --> 13:22.726
without much effort being put into.

13:23.073 --> 13:26.882
It is not possible to get rid of these things easily.

13:28.780 --> 13:33.132
Definitely you can raise the Kundalini, you can feel the Kundalini.

13:34.439 --> 13:38.791
You can you know for definite that when you say that person has got

13:38.951 --> 13:40.630
this left Swadishthana

13:40.719 --> 13:44.495
or anything everybody says the same and you are sure of it.

13:45.351 --> 13:48.625
It is not possible for everyone to say the same thing,

13:48.748 --> 13:51.013
even the children saying the same thing about a person

13:51.148 --> 13:53.348
and he says also it is verified.

13:54.753 --> 14:02.826
So part of it comes to you in complete proof

14:03.418 --> 14:06.096
that there is something about it.

14:10.669 --> 14:13.402
Second part also comes to you as a proof

14:14.753 --> 14:18.593
because now you know there are vibrations flowing into you.

14:18.705 --> 14:20.705
There’s no jugglery about it.

14:21.328 --> 14:26.913
And then you can feel it very clearly.

14:28.476 --> 14:31.420
You have raised the Kundalini of many people.

14:31.945 --> 14:36.052
You have given them realization;
even the photograph has given realization.

14:36.276 --> 14:38.409
You know for definite it is so.

14:43.207 --> 14:47.495
And also you know that if you want to ask any fundamental questions

14:48.586 --> 14:52.503
you get answer as a great flow of vibrations.

14:53.106 --> 14:55.039
So when you ask the question

14:55.416 --> 14:57.096
[Mother speaks aside].

15:01.197 --> 15:04.525
When you ask the question, “Whether there is God?”,

15:05.795 --> 15:10.491
immediately you get tremendous vibrations proving that there is.

15:13.762 --> 15:17.346
You ask the some questions, which you know for definite

15:17.980 --> 15:19.660
and say, “Is it so?”

15:23.762 --> 15:25.895
And you know that it is not so,

15:26.418 --> 15:29.218
definitely you do not get any vibrations.

15:30.460 --> 15:32.938
That’s how relatively you know

15:33.050 --> 15:35.601
when do you get vibrations when you don’t get vibrations.

15:35.693 --> 15:38.331
If you ask a very big fundamental question,

15:38.454 --> 15:41.354
you get vibrations of a very strong nature.

15:41.500 --> 15:44.508
But in ordinary things you might get a little.

15:44.626 --> 15:48.530
So it proves that the vibrations speak to you as vibrations.

15:51.020 --> 15:52.460
This should prove

15:54.680 --> 15:58.200
that there is God because you have asked on vibrations

15:58.576 --> 16:01.476
and you have found that there are vibrations

16:03.453 --> 16:05.133
and that there is God.

16:10.026 --> 16:12.692
Now what happened in the case of Buddha

16:12.850 --> 16:15.383
that He got realization as you got it

16:15.629 --> 16:18.687
and He had no way of finding out whether there is God or not.

16:18.810 --> 16:22.202
So He said, “There is no God, only there is ‘self'”.

16:23.085 --> 16:25.018
But you have gone beyond it.

16:25.384 --> 16:34.101
So if you find seventy percent of the proof through your

16:34.671 --> 16:38.703
own experiencing it and raising of the Kundalini and all that.

16:38.901 --> 16:42.777
Then the thirty percent, whatever it is, is to be ascertained

16:42.867 --> 16:44.547
through the vibrations.

16:44.708 --> 16:47.130
And when you ascertain it through the vibrations

16:47.253 --> 16:49.440
– for example I say, “This is hot”.

16:49.575 --> 16:52.647
How do I know? By feeling it itself, it is hot.

16:53.834 --> 16:56.735
Now anything that makes Me hot is hot.

16:56.960 --> 17:00.810
But relatively I know this is hot, that is hot, that is cold.

17:00.989 --> 17:04.163
In the same way on vibrations also

17:04.867 --> 17:08.579
you can ask various questions and find out ‘yes’ and ‘no’

17:09.487 --> 17:11.487
and then you can believe it –

17:12.735 --> 17:15.045
that there is God Almighty

17:15.547 --> 17:18.728
and this all pervading power exists,

17:19.067 --> 17:23.141
not only exists but operates, the rest of it is all a myth.

17:29.045 --> 17:32.895
But when you rise in Sahaja Yoga being Sahaja,

17:34.692 --> 17:36.372
you take it for granted,

17:37.426 --> 17:41.138
as we take everything for granted. All the trees growing,

17:41.377 --> 17:43.443
the mango tree giving a mango,

17:45.506 --> 17:48.261
guava tree only gives guavas.

17:48.551 --> 17:52.993
We never try to find out how in one little seed

17:53.540 --> 17:56.440
so much is built in, so much is programmed.

17:57.446 --> 18:01.742
We take it for granted all these great miracles of the world.

18:02.937 --> 18:06.393
In the same way we take this miracle also for granted.

18:06.787 --> 18:08.467
This is what ‘maya’ is.

18:08.596 --> 18:13.567
That is makes everything look so simple and straight.

18:14.215 --> 18:17.015
And you just start taking it for granted.

18:20.755 --> 18:25.670
Then you have to understand that it is not to be taken for granted

18:30.157 --> 18:38.587
but is to be very much respected, worshipped and accepted.

18:40.675 --> 18:47.906
The amount of preparation you have,

18:48.298 --> 18:50.498
the amount of strength you have,

18:50.954 --> 18:54.749
that is the amount of truth you are going to get.

18:56.825 --> 18:59.262
Truth also weighs you very clearly

18:59.364 --> 19:02.008
whether you can receive it or not.

19:04.705 --> 19:09.497
There is no diplomacy that can work this out.

19:09.609 --> 19:11.182
No cheating, nothing.

19:11.317 --> 19:13.250
Truth knows how far you are.

19:15.569 --> 19:18.660
The more you become stronger,

19:18.861 --> 19:21.528
the more the truth manifest through you

19:22.210 --> 19:23.943
and you receive the truth.

19:27.143 --> 19:30.362
Just now some of you are still little babies of

19:30.474 --> 19:33.866
three months and four months and something like that.

19:35.326 --> 19:38.410
And still sometimes taken for granted

19:40.955 --> 19:43.488
you do things which you should not do

19:43.656 --> 19:45.176
and harm yourself.

19:45.275 --> 19:47.846
Its only question of harming yourself

19:47.919 --> 19:50.052
not harming Me or harming Sahaja Yoga,

19:50.144 --> 19:53.088
which cannot be harmed, but you harm yourself.

19:54.096 --> 19:56.096
So one has to be very careful

19:56.194 --> 19:59.202
one should understand the laws and regulations

20:01.429 --> 20:03.629
as Gavin had read the last time,

20:04.955 --> 20:10.172
the statutes of God’s laws.

20:12.651 --> 20:16.295
You must understand how it works.

20:16.582 --> 20:22.110
You cannot take law into your hands by taking it for granted.

20:24.454 --> 20:28.753
Law operates and it knows everything.

20:29.847 --> 20:31.527
It is the law of love.

20:32.983 --> 20:36.759
That’s why it allows you to make little mistakes to learn.

20:37.734 --> 20:40.417
But it will not protect you

20:40.563 --> 20:43.549
when you start saying that all right I want to do it on my own.

20:43.674 --> 20:46.345
“All right”, it says, “All right go ahead”.

20:49.526 --> 20:51.046
So one has to know

20:52.116 --> 20:55.062
that this law operates not blindly,

20:55.252 --> 20:59.756
lovingly and it tries to teach you also sometimes

21:00.627 --> 21:03.763
that don’t do this wrong and don’t do that wrong.

21:05.124 --> 21:08.990
But when it comes to real punishment,

21:09.370 --> 21:14.146
the punishment is that this law leaves you alone.

21:18.031 --> 21:19.711
It just lets you go;

21:19.830 --> 21:21.439
the attention recedes,

21:21.529 --> 21:24.537
that the worst thing that can happen to anyone.

21:25.239 --> 21:29.467
That you are not in the attention of God is the worst thing.

21:30.751 --> 21:35.722
So even if you make mistakes doesn’t matter.

21:36.514 --> 21:38.980
Pray for the attention of God always

21:39.093 --> 21:41.759
because the attention of God is the law

21:42.865 --> 21:44.065
– law of love.

21:46.270 --> 21:51.091
You cannot cheat it, everything is known.

21:52.766 --> 21:58.919
Every word you say is known, every word you don’t say is known,

21:59.099 --> 22:02.926
every thought that comes in you is known.

22:05.750 --> 22:12.588
So purify yourself with love, understanding.

22:12.878 --> 22:16.782
Try to purify and tell yourself that I have to purify myself

22:16.918 --> 22:18.598
as much as possible.

22:18.738 --> 22:22.450
With purification only you will have the proper strength.

22:22.845 --> 22:24.578
If you have not purified,

22:25.032 --> 22:28.808
then there won’t be any strength for you to bear the truth.

22:30.079 --> 22:34.923
Once you bear the truth your own life will convince people

22:36.084 --> 22:37.764
that you are Divine.

22:38.504 --> 22:40.638
Your face will convince people.

22:40.849 --> 22:44.737
Everything that you do will convince people that you are Divine

22:44.861 --> 22:46.389
and whatever you say,

22:46.512 --> 22:49.776
people will know it is coming through Divine Force.

22:56.122 --> 22:58.447
May God bless you.
