00:00:00.858 --> 00:00:04.198
Now the question he asked me

00:00:04.921 --> 00:00:09.666
was in the nature of a entire of a person

00:00:10.881 --> 00:00:19.003
who wants to find out, what is the proof that there is God.

00:00:20.801 --> 00:00:26.601
I How are we to convince people, what is God?

00:00:27.402 --> 00:00:33.007
That we have to achieve something, as far as God is concerned?

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.906
How are we to convince them
that we have got all these centers within us

00:00:40.806 --> 00:00:44.021
and that you have to achieve that realization?

00:00:44.236 --> 00:00:46.989
And also how are we to prove to others that

00:00:47.165 --> 00:00:49.565
you have achieved your realization?

00:00:53.673 --> 00:00:55.856
This is the question

00:00:56.521 --> 00:01:00.544
which everyone who is not yet a fully Sahaja Yogi

00:01:01.091 --> 00:01:04.567
would feel and ask you questions and you should all

00:01:04.841 --> 00:01:06.345
answers to it.

00:01:09.522 --> 00:01:12.026
The first and foremost question is

00:01:12.182 --> 00:01:14.516
how do we prove that there is God?

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:20.769
Because you assumed that there is God

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.670
because somebody has said, “There is God.”

00:01:24.921 --> 00:01:29.747
Now what are the ways of proving this that there is God?

00:01:33.475 --> 00:01:35.808
So we have to attack the question,

00:01:38.105 --> 00:01:40.543
first from the reasoning point of you

00:01:40.733 --> 00:01:45.570
that we should be able to tell people that there is God

00:01:46.296 --> 00:01:49.789
through reason not through experiencing

00:01:50.001 --> 00:01:52.201
because they are to be prepared.

00:01:54.756 --> 00:01:58.429
There will be many who really do not believe

00:01:58.662 --> 00:02:02.759
in God but just out of fashion they’re saying “All right we accept”

00:02:02.927 --> 00:02:07.295
because they want to keep up peace and the compromise.

00:02:08.824 --> 00:02:15.782
But how you start about convincing them rationally?

00:02:16.027 --> 00:02:18.499
Perhaps I spoke in one of My lectures if you have that,

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.800
I don’t know if you have got it.

00:02:21.981 --> 00:02:26.830
But we can prove it – the existence of God.

00:02:28.996 --> 00:02:32.132
You may call it God or nature or whatever it is,

00:02:32.668 --> 00:02:34.348
from many point of view.

00:02:35.179 --> 00:02:37.731
For example in short we can say,

00:02:37.843 --> 00:02:41.235
“There are many scientific things we cannot explain”.

00:02:45.923 --> 00:02:50.469
We cannot explain how the periodic laws were established

00:02:51.307 --> 00:02:53.307
without somebody being there.

00:02:57.144 --> 00:03:01.239
Periodic laws of chemical substances

00:03:01.631 --> 00:03:07.155
of the elements that exist on this Earth is so regular

00:03:07.276 --> 00:03:09.122
and so properly plotted down

00:03:09.234 --> 00:03:11.075
that you can see there must be some plotter

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:13.385
otherwise it cannot be done.

00:03:13.575 --> 00:03:16.967
I mean if you want to avoid it,
you can avoid it but there must be someone.

00:03:17.101 --> 00:03:18.834
Say we come in this room

00:03:18.932 --> 00:03:21.436
and find everything properly organized,

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:25.730
lit up and we should know there must be somebody who has done it.

00:03:29.249 --> 00:03:36.518
Then a very good example is given by a very good French biologist,

00:03:37.813 --> 00:03:41.835
he says that if you use law of chance,

00:03:42.338 --> 00:03:46.980
the law of chance states that

00:03:47.438 --> 00:03:52.247
– if you have got fifty red pebbles and fifty white pebbles

00:03:52.806 --> 00:03:56.984
put in a jar and if you shake that jar

00:03:57.342 --> 00:03:59.475
it goes into a chaotic condition

00:04:00.741 --> 00:04:07.776
and the distribution of these pebbles is in a chaotic manner.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:15.247
To bring them back to their normal condition of having the red

00:04:15.683 --> 00:04:18.583
on one side and the white on the other side,

00:04:20.125 --> 00:04:24.042
you go on shaking it as many times as you like

00:04:24.645 --> 00:04:26.912
and they have found out – there’s

00:04:27.047 --> 00:04:30.311
minimum of minimum so many times it has to be done

00:04:31.221 --> 00:04:34.178
otherwise it cannot be worked out.

00:04:35.528 --> 00:04:37.395
This is all done by chance.

00:04:37.527 --> 00:04:41.303
You see by chance when it has to come to normal condition.

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:45.372
How many chances you have to take?

00:04:45.551 --> 00:04:48.151
There’s a certain amount of a formula.

00:04:48.274 --> 00:04:51.141
Something raised to power ‘n’, call it ‘n’.

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.314
So as a biologist he tried to calculate

00:04:57.504 --> 00:05:02.001
that if matter has to become living,

00:05:05.652 --> 00:05:07.518
then to get to that density

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:13.475
how many years are required

00:05:16.321 --> 00:05:22.431
by the law of chance to bring forth a living cell – one cell?

00:05:24.262 --> 00:05:28.550
And he found out that billions and billions and billions of years,

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:35.377
if this law of chance works out

00:05:35.713 --> 00:05:39.540
then only one unicellular animal can be created.

00:05:41.762 --> 00:05:48.589
But in this short time from when the Earth receded from

00:05:49.326 --> 00:05:56.881
the Sun and then cooled down and then life came into being,

00:05:57.056 --> 00:06:00.307
then human being were created who are very complicated,

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:02.719
it is such a short time,

00:06:03.031 --> 00:06:06.067
compared to that time which is required by chance.

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:09.969
That he has proved mathematically that it is an impossibility,

00:06:10.093 --> 00:06:11.533
it cannot happen.

00:06:13.385 --> 00:06:15.065
It is that fantastic.

00:06:16.097 --> 00:06:19.425
This is a scientific very good proof of a biologist

00:06:19.601 --> 00:06:23.313
that there is somebody, a juggler, who is doing that job.

00:06:23.574 --> 00:06:25.058
You may call Him ‘God’;

00:06:25.171 --> 00:06:29.075
you may call Him ‘Nature’ whatever is, but the nature thinks.

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:32.760
People like Yung have proved

00:06:32.883 --> 00:06:35.683
the existence of collective consciousness.

00:06:36.142 --> 00:06:40.310
The existence of unconscious, which gives us dreams

00:06:41.047 --> 00:06:46.928
through which we get universal symbols.

00:06:48.815 --> 00:06:53.295
All over the world whether we are in India
or in England or anywhere.

00:06:53.625 --> 00:06:55.770
The symbols are the same

00:06:56.239 --> 00:06:59.695
and he has done experiments with thousands of people.

00:07:00.346 --> 00:07:03.013
On the medical science also one can say

00:07:03.772 --> 00:07:08.270
as you know that one of the arguments we put in for is that

00:07:09.787 --> 00:07:12.482
acetylene and adrenaline

00:07:13.632 --> 00:07:17.728
which are two chemicals when they are in the body – human body,

00:07:18.007 --> 00:07:19.993
they act very arbitrarily.

00:07:20.161 --> 00:07:22.682
Means they have to augment

00:07:23.051 --> 00:07:25.718
– mean to contract or to relax.

00:07:25.942 --> 00:07:29.691
Those who relax must relax;
those who have to contract must contract.

00:07:29.882 --> 00:07:32.783
But those who are supposed to be contracting relax,

00:07:32.895 --> 00:07:36.845
while those who are supposed to be relaxing contract.

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:40.517
So they have not been able to explain and they have written,

00:07:40.607 --> 00:07:44.956
all of the doctors, they say that the mode of conduct of these

00:07:45.157 --> 00:07:48.059
chemicals in the body one cannot say.

00:07:48.829 --> 00:07:56.880
Another thing is that one of the very very important

00:07:57.048 --> 00:07:59.782
arguments that people have given is this

00:07:59.894 --> 00:08:05.506
that supposing a foreign body goes inside the human body,

00:08:05.773 --> 00:08:09.805
there’s always a tendency to throw it out as soon as possible.

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:13.051
Supposing something goes into your throat, you cough out.

00:08:13.207 --> 00:08:16.089
Supposing something goes in the blood,
they will try to throw it away.

00:08:16.291 --> 00:08:21.760
That’s the system it is. But when the fetus is formed in the body,

00:08:23.557 --> 00:08:27.461
then not only it is kept there, it is nurtured, looked after

00:08:27.656 --> 00:08:29.923
and thrown out at the right time.

00:08:32.946 --> 00:08:34.679
How can you explain that?

00:08:34.844 --> 00:08:36.908
There are thousand and one explanations

00:08:37.054 --> 00:08:40.894
people have tried to give but none of them are satisfactory.

00:08:41.164 --> 00:08:44.289
Then this Earth is spinning with such a speed

00:08:44.569 --> 00:08:48.698
and we are kept glued to this Earth, we never even feel the speed.

00:08:48.877 --> 00:08:50.811
And so many things like that

00:08:50.975 --> 00:08:54.559
people have been able to say and the so many scientists

00:08:55.219 --> 00:09:00.308
have felt that, there is some force

00:09:00.887 --> 00:09:03.687
which is beyond us which is very dynamic,

00:09:03.835 --> 00:09:07.355
which acts in such dynamic ways that we cannot explain.

00:09:08.284 --> 00:09:11.498
So we come to a point where we tell people

00:09:11.597 --> 00:09:15.318
that there is some force which we have to discover.

00:09:17.751 --> 00:09:22.636
Now then as Sahaja Yogis you can say that this hankering to seek.

00:09:24.219 --> 00:09:27.185
After a certain level of evolution because

00:09:27.354 --> 00:09:30.100
some people do not have a thirst seeking, you know that.

00:09:30.234 --> 00:09:33.754
They are just seeking food – to eat just like animals.

00:09:33.895 --> 00:09:35.962
Some people are seeking power.

00:09:37.545 --> 00:09:39.945
Some people are seeking money also.

00:09:40.569 --> 00:09:45.439
But there are so many people who are seeking something beyond.

00:09:45.942 --> 00:09:48.363
This seeking has come to us

00:09:51.433 --> 00:09:53.899
and this seeking that has come to us

00:09:54.223 --> 00:10:00.722
has led us to some sort of a path by which we should find out.

00:10:01.738 --> 00:10:06.282
Now you have seen with your naked eyes,
a Kundalini rising at My Feet.

00:10:06.425 --> 00:10:09.325
You have seen the pulsation of the Kundalini

00:10:09.455 --> 00:10:11.522
definitely that nobody can do.

00:10:11.765 --> 00:10:13.899
There is no mesmerism, nothing.

00:10:17.435 --> 00:10:20.507
When the Kundalini rises, with the stethoscope

00:10:20.598 --> 00:10:23.331
you can feel the rising of the Kundalini.

00:10:23.542 --> 00:10:26.712
With the rising of Kundalini you have known that

00:10:26.858 --> 00:10:28.922
we have cured people of different diseases.

00:10:29.084 --> 00:10:31.155
Even a person who was just dying,

00:10:31.301 --> 00:10:34.168
whom doctor had decided that they are dead

00:10:34.605 --> 00:10:38.195
and to be buried very soon, have been cured.

00:10:41.008 --> 00:10:45.232
And it is so dynamic, the dynamism I’ll tell you. It’s so dynamic

00:10:45.764 --> 00:10:49.626
– like we can take the case of Eddy’s? brother.

00:10:51.042 --> 00:10:54.105
That he was so very sick and they said,

00:10:54.306 --> 00:10:57.543
“He has got blood cancer, he’s going to die within eight days”.

00:10:57.689 --> 00:11:02.621
I mean he just told Me this, that’s all and he’s cured.

00:11:03.548 --> 00:11:07.644
Then Linda told Me that her mother was always angry with Peter.

00:11:09.805 --> 00:11:17.650
[Mother speaks aside – “Where is she gone? Where is she? Linda!”]

00:11:23.922 --> 00:11:27.218
– So she told Me that

00:11:27.397 --> 00:11:29.615
the mother would never talk to Peter,

00:11:29.705 --> 00:11:32.629
she was very angry with him always, she would never talk to him.

00:11:32.819 --> 00:11:37.707
But she told Me all these things

00:11:37.896 --> 00:11:40.832
and suddenly she found that now she’s become very good

00:11:40.955 --> 00:11:43.355
and congenial and nice and talking.

00:11:45.107 --> 00:11:47.907
You have seen such transformations coming

00:11:48.403 --> 00:11:50.469
among many, many, many people.

00:11:50.605 --> 00:11:53.388
How people are changing, transforming,

00:11:53.525 --> 00:11:56.475
this is absolutely dynamic; you cannot do it.

00:11:59.143 --> 00:12:01.743
So many sick people are suddenly cured

00:12:02.324 --> 00:12:04.524
only through attention you know.

00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:11.196
There must be something about it

00:12:11.888 --> 00:12:14.355
and that is how you have to convince

00:12:20.423 --> 00:12:23.402
people about Sahaja.

00:12:24.731 --> 00:12:26.731
But after getting realization

00:12:27.575 --> 00:12:31.577
you just see the Kundalini, you see the rising of the Kundalini.

00:12:31.784 --> 00:12:35.628
You also feel the vibrating force of Kundalini.

00:12:36.376 --> 00:12:38.509
You also see how you got cured,

00:12:39.278 --> 00:12:41.544
how you got out of your problems?

00:12:43.348 --> 00:12:50.644
How you were in trouble? What problems you had?

00:12:51.902 --> 00:12:53.902
You had seen all these things

00:12:56.318 --> 00:12:58.718
and these things happen to you also.

00:12:59.084 --> 00:13:02.074
Some of you were drug addicts,

00:13:02.445 --> 00:13:05.548
some of you were suffering from some mental troubles.

00:13:05.671 --> 00:13:08.071
Some were having physical problems.

00:13:08.258 --> 00:13:13.648
All these, you see, are cured and you are much better people now.

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:19.936
This has happened to you very easily

00:13:20.059 --> 00:13:22.726
without much effort being put into.

00:13:23.073 --> 00:13:26.882
It is not possible to get rid of these things easily.

00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:33.132
Definitely you can raise the Kundalini, you can feel the Kundalini.

00:13:34.439 --> 00:13:38.791
You can you know for definite that when you say that person has got

00:13:38.951 --> 00:13:40.630
this left Swadishthana

00:13:40.719 --> 00:13:44.495
or anything everybody says the same and you are sure of it.

00:13:45.351 --> 00:13:48.625
It is not possible for everyone to say the same thing,

00:13:48.748 --> 00:13:51.013
even the children saying the same thing about a person

00:13:51.148 --> 00:13:53.348
and he says also it is verified.

00:13:54.753 --> 00:14:02.826
So part of it comes to you in complete proof

00:14:03.418 --> 00:14:06.096
that there is something about it.

00:14:10.669 --> 00:14:13.402
Second part also comes to you as a proof

00:14:14.753 --> 00:14:18.593
because now you know there are vibrations flowing into you.

00:14:18.705 --> 00:14:20.705
There’s no jugglery about it.

00:14:21.328 --> 00:14:26.913
And then you can feel it very clearly.

00:14:28.476 --> 00:14:31.420
You have raised the Kundalini of many people.

00:14:31.945 --> 00:14:36.052
You have given them realization;
even the photograph has given realization.

00:14:36.276 --> 00:14:38.409
You know for definite it is so.

00:14:43.207 --> 00:14:47.495
And also you know that if you want to ask any fundamental questions

00:14:48.586 --> 00:14:52.503
you get answer as a great flow of vibrations.

00:14:53.106 --> 00:14:55.039
So when you ask the question

00:14:55.416 --> 00:14:57.096
[Mother speaks aside].

00:15:01.197 --> 00:15:04.525
When you ask the question, “Whether there is God?”,

00:15:05.795 --> 00:15:10.491
immediately you get tremendous vibrations proving that there is.

00:15:13.762 --> 00:15:17.346
You ask the some questions, which you know for definite

00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:19.660
and say, “Is it so?”

00:15:23.762 --> 00:15:25.895
And you know that it is not so,

00:15:26.418 --> 00:15:29.218
definitely you do not get any vibrations.

00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:32.938
That’s how relatively you know

00:15:33.050 --> 00:15:35.601
when do you get vibrations when you don’t get vibrations.

00:15:35.693 --> 00:15:38.331
If you ask a very big fundamental question,

00:15:38.454 --> 00:15:41.354
you get vibrations of a very strong nature.

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:44.508
But in ordinary things you might get a little.

00:15:44.626 --> 00:15:48.530
So it proves that the vibrations speak to you as vibrations.

00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:52.460
This should prove

00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:58.200
that there is God because you have asked on vibrations

00:15:58.576 --> 00:16:01.476
and you have found that there are vibrations

00:16:03.453 --> 00:16:05.133
and that there is God.

00:16:10.026 --> 00:16:12.692
Now what happened in the case of Buddha

00:16:12.850 --> 00:16:15.383
that He got realization as you got it

00:16:15.629 --> 00:16:18.687
and He had no way of finding out whether there is God or not.

00:16:18.810 --> 00:16:22.202
So He said, “There is no God, only there is ‘self'”.

00:16:23.085 --> 00:16:25.018
But you have gone beyond it.

00:16:25.384 --> 00:16:34.101
So if you find seventy percent of the proof through your

00:16:34.671 --> 00:16:38.703
own experiencing it and raising of the Kundalini and all that.

00:16:38.901 --> 00:16:42.777
Then the thirty percent, whatever it is, is to be ascertained

00:16:42.867 --> 00:16:44.547
through the vibrations.

00:16:44.708 --> 00:16:47.130
And when you ascertain it through the vibrations

00:16:47.253 --> 00:16:49.440
– for example I say, “This is hot”.

00:16:49.575 --> 00:16:52.647
How do I know? By feeling it itself, it is hot.

00:16:53.834 --> 00:16:56.735
Now anything that makes Me hot is hot.

00:16:56.960 --> 00:17:00.810
But relatively I know this is hot, that is hot, that is cold.

00:17:00.989 --> 00:17:04.163
In the same way on vibrations also

00:17:04.867 --> 00:17:08.579
you can ask various questions and find out ‘yes’ and ‘no’

00:17:09.487 --> 00:17:11.487
and then you can believe it –

00:17:12.735 --> 00:17:15.045
that there is God Almighty

00:17:15.547 --> 00:17:18.728
and this all pervading power exists,

00:17:19.067 --> 00:17:23.141
not only exists but operates, the rest of it is all a myth.

00:17:29.045 --> 00:17:32.895
But when you rise in Sahaja Yoga being Sahaja,

00:17:34.692 --> 00:17:36.372
you take it for granted,

00:17:37.426 --> 00:17:41.138
as we take everything for granted. All the trees growing,

00:17:41.377 --> 00:17:43.443
the mango tree giving a mango,

00:17:45.506 --> 00:17:48.261
guava tree only gives guavas.

00:17:48.551 --> 00:17:52.993
We never try to find out how in one little seed

00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:56.440
so much is built in, so much is programmed.

00:17:57.446 --> 00:18:01.742
We take it for granted all these great miracles of the world.

00:18:02.937 --> 00:18:06.393
In the same way we take this miracle also for granted.

00:18:06.787 --> 00:18:08.467
This is what ‘maya’ is.

00:18:08.596 --> 00:18:13.567
That is makes everything look so simple and straight.

00:18:14.215 --> 00:18:17.015
And you just start taking it for granted.

00:18:20.755 --> 00:18:25.670
Then you have to understand that it is not to be taken for granted

00:18:30.157 --> 00:18:38.587
but is to be very much respected, worshipped and accepted.

00:18:40.675 --> 00:18:47.906
The amount of preparation you have,

00:18:48.298 --> 00:18:50.498
the amount of strength you have,

00:18:50.954 --> 00:18:54.749
that is the amount of truth you are going to get.

00:18:56.825 --> 00:18:59.262
Truth also weighs you very clearly

00:18:59.364 --> 00:19:02.008
whether you can receive it or not.

00:19:04.705 --> 00:19:09.497
There is no diplomacy that can work this out.

00:19:09.609 --> 00:19:11.182
No cheating, nothing.

00:19:11.317 --> 00:19:13.250
Truth knows how far you are.

00:19:15.569 --> 00:19:18.660
The more you become stronger,

00:19:18.861 --> 00:19:21.528
the more the truth manifest through you

00:19:22.210 --> 00:19:23.943
and you receive the truth.

00:19:27.143 --> 00:19:30.362
Just now some of you are still little babies of

00:19:30.474 --> 00:19:33.866
three months and four months and something like that.

00:19:35.326 --> 00:19:38.410
And still sometimes taken for granted

00:19:40.955 --> 00:19:43.488
you do things which you should not do

00:19:43.656 --> 00:19:45.176
and harm yourself.

00:19:45.275 --> 00:19:47.846
Its only question of harming yourself

00:19:47.919 --> 00:19:50.052
not harming Me or harming Sahaja Yoga,

00:19:50.144 --> 00:19:53.088
which cannot be harmed, but you harm yourself.

00:19:54.096 --> 00:19:56.096
So one has to be very careful

00:19:56.194 --> 00:19:59.202
one should understand the laws and regulations

00:20:01.429 --> 00:20:03.629
as Gavin had read the last time,

00:20:04.955 --> 00:20:10.172
the statutes of God’s laws.

00:20:12.651 --> 00:20:16.295
You must understand how it works.

00:20:16.582 --> 00:20:22.110
You cannot take law into your hands by taking it for granted.

00:20:24.454 --> 00:20:28.753
Law operates and it knows everything.

00:20:29.847 --> 00:20:31.527
It is the law of love.

00:20:32.983 --> 00:20:36.759
That’s why it allows you to make little mistakes to learn.

00:20:37.734 --> 00:20:40.417
But it will not protect you

00:20:40.563 --> 00:20:43.549
when you start saying that all right I want to do it on my own.

00:20:43.674 --> 00:20:46.345
“All right”, it says, “All right go ahead”.

00:20:49.526 --> 00:20:51.046
So one has to know

00:20:52.116 --> 00:20:55.062
that this law operates not blindly,

00:20:55.252 --> 00:20:59.756
lovingly and it tries to teach you also sometimes

00:21:00.627 --> 00:21:03.763
that don’t do this wrong and don’t do that wrong.

00:21:05.124 --> 00:21:08.990
But when it comes to real punishment,

00:21:09.370 --> 00:21:14.146
the punishment is that this law leaves you alone.

00:21:18.031 --> 00:21:19.711
It just lets you go;

00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:21.439
the attention recedes,

00:21:21.529 --> 00:21:24.537
that the worst thing that can happen to anyone.

00:21:25.239 --> 00:21:29.467
That you are not in the attention of God is the worst thing.

00:21:30.751 --> 00:21:35.722
So even if you make mistakes doesn’t matter.

00:21:36.514 --> 00:21:38.980
Pray for the attention of God always

00:21:39.093 --> 00:21:41.759
because the attention of God is the law

00:21:42.865 --> 00:21:44.065
– law of love.

00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:51.091
You cannot cheat it, everything is known.

00:21:52.766 --> 00:21:58.919
Every word you say is known, every word you don’t say is known,

00:21:59.099 --> 00:22:02.926
every thought that comes in you is known.

00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:12.588
So purify yourself with love, understanding.

00:22:12.878 --> 00:22:16.782
Try to purify and tell yourself that I have to purify myself

00:22:16.918 --> 00:22:18.598
as much as possible.

00:22:18.738 --> 00:22:22.450
With purification only you will have the proper strength.

00:22:22.845 --> 00:22:24.578
If you have not purified,

00:22:25.032 --> 00:22:28.808
then there won’t be any strength for you to bear the truth.

00:22:30.079 --> 00:22:34.923
Once you bear the truth your own life will convince people

00:22:36.084 --> 00:22:37.764
that you are Divine.

00:22:38.504 --> 00:22:40.638
Your face will convince people.

00:22:40.849 --> 00:22:44.737
Everything that you do will convince people that you are Divine

00:22:44.861 --> 00:22:46.389
and whatever you say,

00:22:46.512 --> 00:22:49.776
people will know it is coming through Divine Force.

00:22:56.122 --> 00:22:58.447
May God bless you.
