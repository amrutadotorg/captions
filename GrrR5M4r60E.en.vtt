00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:16.657
With care and with nice things to say

00:00:16.945 --> 00:00:22.329
we can improve the depth of the collectivity,

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.960
and with sincere desire to be collective.

00:00:28.532 --> 00:00:34.673
The desire to be collective has to be very sincere.

00:00:34.874 --> 00:00:43.970
So, this expanse of your being will start.

00:00:44.171 --> 00:00:49.026
The first thing is needed: a sincerity to yourself.

00:00:49.106 --> 00:00:56.288
But we must see our own vision: what you will be in future,

00:00:56.368 --> 00:01:00.325
what you want to be in future.

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.737
Thus the sincerity itself to the idea that you want to be collective,

00:01:06.938 --> 00:01:13.283
itself, will break all barriers.

00:01:14.421 --> 00:01:20.378
If you are sincere to any purpose, anything, then you forget the time,

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:24.340
you forget the labor, you forget everything, you want to achieve it,

00:01:24.541 --> 00:01:27.704
even in small things.

00:01:28.734 --> 00:01:33.092
Now, this sincerity comes from where?

00:01:34.142 --> 00:01:37.808
There are two things which work out sincerity.

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:45.890
Firstly, you must see for yourself what is Sahaja Yoga,

00:01:46.813 --> 00:01:49.704
what it has given you.

00:01:51.501 --> 00:01:55.294
It has given you Realization,

00:01:55.726 --> 00:02:02.027
it has given you that wider vision,
it has given you collective consciousness,

00:02:02.108 --> 00:02:06.915
it has given you thoughtless awareness and doubtless awareness.

00:02:07.116 --> 00:02:15.620
It has made a new personality out of you, like an egg becoming a bird.

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.852
And now you are a bird and you cannot go back to the shell again.

00:02:22.752 --> 00:02:30.629
And this understanding of what you have achieved in Sahaja Yoga

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:37.693
should immediately make you realize what you are.

00:02:40.906 --> 00:02:46.232
And when it all has happened to us, automatically,

00:02:46.433 --> 00:02:50.325
you should be very sincere about it,

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:57.375
you must feel that something really you have achieved,

00:02:57.576 --> 00:03:00.328
there’s something so great,

00:03:00.529 --> 00:03:08.064
so we have to be sincere, mentally also you should feel that way.

00:03:08.265 --> 00:03:14.392
So, this is first thing you do is to mentally feel, to mentally feel

00:03:14.593 --> 00:03:23.425
that it’s so important, it is so - it is so important,

00:03:23.702 --> 00:03:32.224
it is so valuable.

00:03:34.457 --> 00:03:38.385
You become very sincere about it.

00:03:40.032 --> 00:03:47.531
But the second part is different:

00:03:49.248 --> 00:03:54.630
where you see something, you know something

00:03:54.831 --> 00:03:59.352
and you start opening your heart about it.

00:03:59.876 --> 00:04:05.768
In the second part you have to open your heart.

00:04:05.969 --> 00:04:10.514
So, the sincerity comes from an open heart:

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:15.269
if your heart is not open, you cannot be sincere.

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:18.923
We have already got a stone heart when we come to Sahaja Yoga

00:04:19.124 --> 00:04:23.364
and we have a brain either full of ego or superego.

00:04:23.565 --> 00:04:30.029
So now, with your Kundalini rising,
you can clear out your head, first of all.

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:35.232
So, the sincerity will come when the Kundalini will move

00:04:35.433 --> 00:04:42.441
and touch your Brahmarandhra, which is
the seat of your heart and will expand.

00:04:42.734 --> 00:04:48.424
But, as it is, also it’s very easy to get rid of these two.

00:04:48.625 --> 00:04:51.217
It’s very easy to get rid of these two.

00:04:51.418 --> 00:04:57.391
Only by raising your Kundalini and breaking your Brahmarandhra.

00:04:57.592 --> 00:05:00.331
This is the greatest achievement that you have got,

00:05:00.532 --> 00:05:03.207
that you can break your Brahmarandhra,

00:05:03.408 --> 00:05:07.203
make your Kundalini get connected with the All-pervading Power.

00:05:07.404 --> 00:05:09.517
That’s why I always say you must meditate

00:05:09.718 --> 00:05:13.122
and you must be in thoughtless awareness, then it works out.

00:05:13.323 --> 00:05:16.149
Don’t pay attention to outside things so much.

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:27.488
Of course, you are, in a way, responsible for Sahaja Yoga,

00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:33.070
because you are sincere about it. You cannot force yourself.

00:05:33.271 --> 00:05:36.871
So, again and again I say, you weigh your sincerity.

00:05:37.072 --> 00:05:39.680
‘How sincere am I to Sahaja Yoga?’

00:05:39.757 --> 00:05:42.470
If you find these nice feelings

00:05:42.551 --> 00:05:48.060
and nice emotions and nice things said, then what do you do?

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:52.747
You collect them, all these things, keep them and use them

00:05:52.948 --> 00:06:00.596
at the right time, at the right place.
This is what is the wisdom of Shri Ganesha.

00:06:00.796 --> 00:06:06.785
Innocent people are the most sincere people, innocent people.

00:06:06.986 --> 00:06:10.765
Those who are clever and cunning cannot be sincere

00:06:10.966 --> 00:06:13.014
because they enjoy their cunningness,

00:06:13.215 --> 00:06:18.934
they enjoy their so-called ‘brilliance”. They can never be.

00:06:19.135 --> 00:06:27.859
Those people who are simple, who are loving,

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:32.597
who care for love more than anything else,

00:06:32.798 --> 00:06:39.555
can only say very nice things sincerely.

00:06:39.636 --> 00:06:44.999
So, any such problems, your problems can
be solved because you are sincere,

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:51.849
but if you’re insincere, you’ll meet only
insincere people and then you’ll go down,

00:06:52.087 --> 00:06:55.788
go down into your own estimation and estimation of others.

00:06:55.989 --> 00:06:58.259
And you’ll have no place in Sahaja Yoga.

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:01.612
There’s no place for insincere people in Sahaj Yoga,

00:07:01.813 --> 00:07:05.092
so try to develop your sincerity. Raise your Kundalini

00:07:05.293 --> 00:07:10.684
as many times as you can. Keep it there. Keep it on Sahastrara

00:07:10.885 --> 00:07:15.258
and see that your heart opens. That’s the best way.

00:07:19.674 --> 00:07:28.127
So, with this kind of an ego a Sahaja Yogi
can see, you see, himself, how he behaves.

00:07:35.571 --> 00:07:43.341
I watch them and it provides a lot of humour for Me.
I watch them with their ego.

00:07:43.421 --> 00:07:44.661
Yogi: "Them" being the leaders?

00:07:44.741 --> 00:07:46.241
No, no, no! All! All of them.

00:07:46.321 --> 00:07:47.421
I was worried.

00:08:01.871 --> 00:08:05.918
They push forward everywhere,
they’ll sit in the forward line,

00:08:05.999 --> 00:08:09.400
they’ll push forward, they’ll be there first to

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:13.590
come in the front line, sort of thing is there.

00:08:26.641 --> 00:08:29.569
But if you are a sincere person,

00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:36.212
if you have the sincerity, then you’ll enjoy
that sincerity wherever you are standing,

00:08:36.299 --> 00:08:38.799
wherever you are sitting.

00:08:48.544 --> 00:08:52.812
So, the ego can try to deceive
you very much all the time,

00:08:52.892 --> 00:08:55.424
so you have to be
careful about this ego

00:08:55.504 --> 00:08:58.911
because he can sit on your
head and can monitor you.

00:09:12.794 --> 00:09:20.321
I have seen people going down very rapidly
with this idea that they’re something special.

00:09:31.067 --> 00:09:34.857
So, sincerity, though it is the quality of the left side,

00:09:34.937 --> 00:09:38.497
can be dominated by the right side, this way.

00:09:52.375 --> 00:09:57.055
Today is the great day of Diwali.

00:09:59.655 --> 00:10:04.695
That means today is the great day .....(Inaudible)

00:10:05.775 --> 00:10:08.615
lights of your heart together

00:10:09.255 --> 00:10:12.695
to make a greater light

00:10:12.855 --> 00:10:17.255
for the world to move in a proper direction.

00:10:18.175 --> 00:10:25.255
It's a day of great joy, and those who join in this,

00:10:26.655 --> 00:10:30.055
are spreading also great joy.

00:10:32.455 --> 00:10:37.095
But the problems are there, as they say,

00:10:38.735 --> 00:10:43.415
but for us there is no problem because there is no darkness,

00:10:43.775 --> 00:10:46.495
we don't see any darkness anywhere,

00:10:46.615 --> 00:10:49.695
we see lights, and lights, and lights.

00:10:51.735 --> 00:11:02.375
Then what is the thing missing, missing is our sincerity.

00:11:04.335 --> 00:11:07.775
We have to be very sincere with ourselves,

00:11:08.935 --> 00:11:16.375
because it is not just a borrowed love or a borrowed joy,

00:11:16.815 --> 00:11:19.895
but it is from within the source,

00:11:20.175 --> 00:11:23.175
it's flowing, flowing and flowing.

00:11:25.295 --> 00:11:31.295
So that is to be awakened, and that love should flow,

00:11:32.455 --> 00:11:36.975
and our small petty things like jealousies

00:11:38.295 --> 00:11:43.895
and competitions and all those things which spoil us

00:11:45.135 --> 00:11:47.655
must be washed away.

00:11:47.815 --> 00:11:53.535
And it can be washed if your heart is full of love.

00:11:56.895 --> 00:12:04.175
Today is a day of spreading love, light of love,

00:12:05.135 --> 00:12:11.215
so that everybody feels enlightened and happy

00:12:12.175 --> 00:12:16.455
and forgets these petty problems.

00:12:20.231 --> 00:12:28.967
First and foremost is: time must be given for your development.

00:12:29.168 --> 00:12:34.782
Not to show Me or not to show anyone. It is between you and yourself.

00:12:34.983 --> 00:12:40.213
You have to work hard to cleanse yourself.

00:12:40.321 --> 00:12:49.805
Easy to live comfortably with all the horrible chakras within us,

00:12:49.883 --> 00:12:54.702
but it is easier also and the best, most enjoyable

00:12:54.702 --> 00:13:01.064
is, to have very clean chakras.

00:13:01.257 --> 00:13:08.097
And it comes [by], first of all, is sincerity.

00:13:08.218 --> 00:13:16.019
First of all is complete sincerity. Are we sincere to ourselves?

00:13:16.129 --> 00:13:20.214
Sometimes it is misunderstood. People think if you have to be sincere to ourself,

00:13:20.415 --> 00:13:23.699
we should deny Sahaja Yoga.

00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:29.840
Sahaja Yoga is the union between you and God,

00:13:30.041 --> 00:13:37.825
and the sincerity must be full, must be complete.

00:13:38.026 --> 00:13:46.015
Any kind of insincerity which comes into you is extremely detrimental.

00:13:46.239 --> 00:13:52.449
So you must know that, as your Mother has sincerity about you,

00:13:52.650 --> 00:13:59.064
you must also have sincerity about yourself.

00:14:00.423 --> 00:14:03.255
Then you will start enjoying Sahaja Yoga.

00:14:03.456 --> 00:14:08.410
That is very important to create integration within you

00:14:08.611 --> 00:14:12.473
because if it is sincerity, it comes from your heart.

00:14:12.674 --> 00:14:17.208
If it is coming from your heart then your body, your mind,

00:14:17.409 --> 00:14:24.561
your intelligence, everything will work hard to fulfil it.

00:14:24.769 --> 00:14:30.921
But if it is not coming from your heart it is going to be a superficial thing.

00:14:31.122 --> 00:14:35.856
So you try to feel it from your heart.

00:14:36.234 --> 00:14:41.576
That’s what it means: sincerity. Do not depend on anyone –

00:14:41.777 --> 00:14:50.488
your wife, husband, children – nothing – mother, father. It’s your own.

00:14:51.392 --> 00:14:55.678
So you have to work in such a way that you get complete integration

00:14:55.879 --> 00:15:04.269
and the driving force towards integration is a very simple one: is sincerity.

00:15:06.244 --> 00:15:14.667
Thus you will know that automatically you are getting integrated.

00:15:14.868 --> 00:15:20.703
The another factor [which] is important is patience.

00:15:20.846 --> 00:15:24.255
You must have patience with others,

00:15:24.456 --> 00:15:30.357
because if you do not have patience, your sincerity will start doubting itself.

00:15:30.558 --> 00:15:34.505
So you must have patience and to get patience,

00:15:34.706 --> 00:15:40.844
you must know what you have been so far and where are you.

00:15:41.045 --> 00:15:44.193
When you will know what you were, you will have patience with others,

00:15:44.394 --> 00:15:47.981
tremendous patience.

00:15:48.014 --> 00:15:55.662
And by having patience with others, your sincerity will be all the time complete.

00:15:55.879 --> 00:16:01.515
By your sincerity, you will  be completely integrated.

00:16:01.652 --> 00:16:05.191
So we come to the point of sincerity.

00:16:05.392 --> 00:16:12.050
Now let us go deeper into it: how the sincerity is to be maintained.

00:16:12.206 --> 00:16:16.647
First of all we have to make some determinations,

00:16:16.848 --> 00:16:20.346
sankalpas (vows), of being sincere.

00:16:20.547 --> 00:16:28.673
Then we have to act by finding out how do we get insincere on what points.

00:16:28.874 --> 00:16:34.274
You are good at analysing, you can find it out: how do you get insincere,

00:16:34.274 --> 00:16:38.279
on what points you get insincere, what are the correcting points.

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:42.290
Keep a control on your mind to see how does it become insincere.

00:16:42.491 --> 00:16:47.516
You’ll be amazed that it’s simpler to be sincere than to be insincere.

00:16:47.717 --> 00:16:53.483
Is the easiest thing is to be sincere than to be deceiving,

00:16:53.684 --> 00:16:59.496
because you don’t have to think. To be sincere you don’t have to think.

00:16:59.697 --> 00:17:02.591
If you have to be insincere you have to think, plan out

00:17:02.591 --> 00:17:10.520
and to find out methods, all the loopholes
and escapes, by which you have to run away.

00:17:10.649 --> 00:17:13.556
If you have to be captive of your sincerity,

00:17:13.757 --> 00:17:16.184
you don’t have to worry about anything

00:17:16.385 --> 00:17:20.447
and that sincerity itself is rewarding.

00:17:20.648 --> 00:17:24.272
This principle must be written down in your hearts

00:17:24.473 --> 00:17:28.171
that sincerity itself is rewarding.

00:17:28.372 --> 00:17:33.007
You don’t have to go to anybody else

00:17:33.208 --> 00:17:39.383
to ask for the reward of sincerity, sincerity itself rewards you.

00:17:39.584 --> 00:17:43.816
And that’s why you start enjoying your own sincerity.

00:17:44.017 --> 00:17:47.582
If you start seeing all these things as a witness,

00:17:47.783 --> 00:17:54.045
that how your sincerity has made you so beautiful, so dignified

00:17:54.246 --> 00:18:00.398
and how you have started rising in your self-esteem,

00:18:00.524 --> 00:18:04.965
you’ll be amazed how sincerity itself is a big force

00:18:05.166 --> 00:18:14.563
which will manifest its living dynamism
in you and you’ll be a transformed person.

00:18:14.764 --> 00:18:20.305
This transformation within you is going to change the whole world.

00:18:21.079 --> 00:18:28.409
The more alert you become the more Divine takes interest in you.

00:18:29.255 --> 00:18:34.527
But this alertness is nothing but the enlightenment of your sincerity.

00:18:34.728 --> 00:18:38.404
You’ll be amazed how sincerity is the thing.

00:18:38.605 --> 00:18:45.252
That means you are loyal to yourself. You have to be loyal and not disloyal.

00:18:45.453 --> 00:18:49.100
The loyalty to yourself is sincerity

00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:52.676
and that is how I have managed Sahaja Yoga.

00:18:52.802 --> 00:18:56.300
But sincerity is My nature, I don’t have to strive for it.

00:18:56.300 --> 00:19:01.977
I cannot get out of it.
While, if I am your ideal,

00:19:01.977 --> 00:19:06.937
you should try to imbibe My nature within yourself.

00:19:07.096 --> 00:19:14.036
And then you will be amazed how you are connected with Me.

00:19:14.237 --> 00:19:19.468
Then we all move like one wave,

00:19:19.669 --> 00:19:24.170
one being, one personality.

00:19:24.371 --> 00:19:32.191
That is the achievement of this Sahasrara Day.

00:19:33.337 --> 00:19:39.810
Sincerity of purpose brought in action, not theory and philosophy,

00:19:40.011 --> 00:19:48.064
but in action, active sincerity, in every way, and patience,

00:19:48.265 --> 00:19:53.845
all these things will bring forth the complete integration within.

00:19:55.411 --> 00:20:04.173
Try to become sincere and sincere and sincere and enjoy your sincerity.

00:20:05.092 --> 00:20:08.980
If you can look at yourself as how privileged you are

00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:16.128
and understanding it, understanding what all Sahaja Yoga is,

00:20:16.128 --> 00:20:26.161
then you will understand that what a privilege
it is for you to be here, what fortune,

00:20:26.362 --> 00:20:34.534
what reward for what you have done.

00:20:34.735 --> 00:20:47.441
How many lives have been completely rewarded by being here.

00:20:47.795 --> 00:20:55.834
This will help you to do puja in a more sincere manner.

00:20:56.053 --> 00:20:57.944
May God bless you.
