00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:10.217
[Shiva] has the power to give you vibrations.

00:00:10.321 --> 00:00:13.154
He gives you vibrations.

00:00:17.362 --> 00:00:21.487
The Goddess is the power, Shakti,

00:00:22.362 --> 00:00:24.406
but He makes the vibrations.

00:00:24.487 --> 00:00:28.240
It's like these are the fingers, all right,

00:00:28.321 --> 00:00:32.403
but if they tickle you then it's Shiva.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.447
The fingers are that of the Goddess, all right,

00:00:38.528 --> 00:00:42.656
but if it tickles, you know, gives you joy,

00:00:42.737 --> 00:00:47.321
happiness, it's Shiva, is the bhakti.

00:00:48.612 --> 00:00:52.362
The joy of bhakti comes from Shiva.

00:00:54.487 --> 00:00:57.406
Today only I was explaining

00:00:57.487 --> 00:01:01.073
how one lady who was a Devi bhakt

00:01:01.154 --> 00:01:04.031
and has done so much study of bhakti

00:01:04.112 --> 00:01:06.281
and all that and knew so much,

00:01:06.362 --> 00:01:10.325
just merged into Me.

00:01:10.406 --> 00:01:13.906
I just couldn't understand her how, what she has done,

00:01:13.987 --> 00:01:15.781
because normally people don't do.

00:01:15.862 --> 00:01:17.906
When they are reading about Devi they think,

00:01:17.987 --> 00:01:21.823
"All right, this is Devi, this is Mataji."
You see, it's separate things.

00:01:21.904 --> 00:01:25.862
They don't know they are reading about Devi.

00:01:26.653 --> 00:01:29.240
So she said, "Mother, I just identified.

00:01:29.321 --> 00:01:32.531
It's written that how You are gentle,

00:01:32.612 --> 00:01:35.531
the Goddess is gentle, how She touches me,

00:01:35.612 --> 00:01:37.531
how She looks after me,

00:01:37.612 --> 00:01:40.322
how Her attention is on me."

00:01:40.403 --> 00:01:44.280
Like there's a sentence "kataksha, kataksha, nirikshana:

00:01:44.361 --> 00:01:47.031
every glance is an inspection."

00:01:47.112 --> 00:01:49.240
But "inspection" not a very good word,

00:01:49.321 --> 00:01:54.191
but "nirikshana" means inspection, divine inspection.

00:01:55.487 --> 00:01:58.115
"So all the time I feel that it's You, You,

00:01:58.196 --> 00:02:01.864
You are all the time - when I listen to music

00:02:01.945 --> 00:02:05.364
I feel now, see, She is looking at me,

00:02:05.445 --> 00:02:09.406
She is feeling me, She is nourishing me.

00:02:09.487 --> 00:02:12.929
All the time I feel Your love."

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.406
That's how the bhakti comes in.

00:02:17.487 --> 00:02:19.115
So if you have vibrations

00:02:19.196 --> 00:02:24.135
that doesn't mean that they are something dry, you see?

00:02:24.653 --> 00:02:26.990
No,

00:02:27.071 --> 00:02:31.071
it means the joy of bhakti.

00:02:33.737 --> 00:02:37.531
Bhakti is, you can call it adoration, this, that.

00:02:37.612 --> 00:02:42.653
It's the ocean of love that is God.

00:02:43.653 --> 00:02:45.572
You just get drenched into it.

00:02:45.653 --> 00:02:48.112
There's no words to it.

00:02:52.361 --> 00:02:56.904
And that is what when you feel,
you must know that

00:02:57.612 --> 00:03:01.612
you have taken the spirit

00:03:03.071 --> 00:03:07.196
as a real connection

00:03:08.612 --> 00:03:11.862
between you and your Mother,

00:03:12.987 --> 00:03:15.528
or your Father.

00:03:17.487 --> 00:03:22.987
There's no differentiation.

00:03:25.403 --> 00:03:27.551
You are one

00:03:28.987 --> 00:03:32.031
in that ocean, drenched in the ocean.

00:03:32.112 --> 00:03:35.240
You are the drop, you are the ocean.

00:03:35.321 --> 00:03:39.153
You are one in that bhakti.

00:03:39.361 --> 00:03:43.361
And that bhakti cannot be mechanical,

00:03:46.653 --> 00:03:49.403
because not man-made.

00:03:52.737 --> 00:03:57.361
So to enjoy Sahaja Yoga

00:03:58.653 --> 00:04:03.240
you must know that it's not dry vibrations only,

00:04:03.321 --> 00:04:05.987
but is the bhakti.

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:09.279
That is the joy

00:04:09.904 --> 00:04:12.198
of Shiva's quality,

00:04:12.279 --> 00:04:15.695
the quality of joy that He adds

00:04:16.362 --> 00:04:19.237
to our life.

00:04:19.904 --> 00:04:24.281
Everything seems to be surrounded, resounding.

00:04:24.362 --> 00:04:26.698
Same thing the joy,

00:04:26.779 --> 00:04:29.781
that "I'm loved so much by God,

00:04:29.862 --> 00:04:32.156
that God loves me,

00:04:32.237 --> 00:04:36.200
that I have a meaning in life."

00:04:36.653 --> 00:04:42.217
Then the ego drops out first of all,

00:04:43.237 --> 00:04:48.197
and also the conditionings drop out.
