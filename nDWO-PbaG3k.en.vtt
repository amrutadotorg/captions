00:00:00.041 --> 00:00:04.260
Easter Puja. Istanbul - Turkey
22 April 2001.

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:09.170
Today we have gathered here

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:14.629
to do the puja of Easter.

00:00:16.545 --> 00:00:20.545
In the history of spirituality,

00:00:21.212 --> 00:00:23.420
it is one of the greatest days

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:30.587
when we find Christ rose from the dead.

00:00:33.295 --> 00:00:36.253
It is very significant and symbolic

00:00:36.587 --> 00:00:39.545
that in Sahaja Yoga, also

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.337
what we have done,

00:00:42.587 --> 00:00:48.420
is to rise from the dead – into life.

00:00:49.587 --> 00:00:51.587
It is to be understood

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.170
that resurrection is the message for all of us,

00:00:57.128 --> 00:00:58.629
for the whole world.

00:00:59.337 --> 00:01:01.378
We have to resurrect ourselves.

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:09.504
There was no need for Jesus to do that.

00:01:10.378 --> 00:01:14.295
But He was a model, model of a saint,

00:01:14.504 --> 00:01:17.295
model of a realised soul,

00:01:17.462 --> 00:01:21.462
model of a person who came all the way

00:01:21.712 --> 00:01:23.712
from the heavens to save us.

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.212
So this resurrection is also

00:01:27.295 --> 00:01:30.212
part and parcel of our lives.

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.170
It is so symbolic, so very symbolic,

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.212
that we were,

00:01:42.128 --> 00:01:45.170
in our consciousness, lost people.

00:01:46.337 --> 00:01:49.170
We had no control over ourselves

00:01:50.128 --> 00:01:53.128
as to know the way our mind told us to go.

00:01:53.295 --> 00:01:56.170
We had no balance with the mind

00:01:56.295 --> 00:01:58.295
and our physical being,

00:01:59.253 --> 00:02:02.170
no balance of any kind in life

00:02:02.337 --> 00:02:04.337
and used to go at random,

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.253
whichever way we thought was good.

00:02:08.253 --> 00:02:10.337
There was no wisdom about it.

00:02:11.337 --> 00:02:17.337
As it is, Jesus was the incarnation of Shri Ganesha.

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.170
It’s a very difficult task He has performed.

00:02:23.128 --> 00:02:24.337
He used to convince people

00:02:25.128 --> 00:02:28.128
who were absolutely ignorant about spirituality,

00:02:29.253 --> 00:02:33.253
who just knew about money and nothing else.

00:02:34.128 --> 00:02:36.128
He came in those days

00:02:36.253 --> 00:02:42.128
when people had no idea about spirituality at all, at all.

00:02:42.212 --> 00:02:45.128
But, somehow,

00:02:45.212 --> 00:02:47.212
it all worked out

00:02:48.128 --> 00:02:50.170
in such a beautiful manner

00:02:51.128 --> 00:02:54.212
that people have started understanding

00:02:54.253 --> 00:02:59.337
that He communicated that resurrection is the important point.

00:03:02.128 --> 00:03:04.170
He knew when the resurrection takes place,

00:03:05.212 --> 00:03:07.212
the Kundalini rises

00:03:07.295 --> 00:03:11.212
and connects you to the Divine Power, which is all-pervading.

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.212
Then you start understanding

00:03:14.253 --> 00:03:16.253
that there’s a life beyond

00:03:17.128 --> 00:03:19.128
the life that you have made.

00:03:19.295 --> 00:03:21.295
There’s another type of life,

00:03:22.128 --> 00:03:27.295
a higher type of life, which connects you to the Divine Power.

00:03:28.337 --> 00:03:33.337
And then this Divine Power gives you the Absolute Truth.

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.212
If you grow more and more,

00:03:37.337 --> 00:03:40.128
you will know Absolute Truth

00:03:40.253 --> 00:03:42.212
because so far you don’t know.

00:03:42.337 --> 00:03:44.253
So we have been doing wrong things,

00:03:44.337 --> 00:03:47.253
going in the wrong way, getting lost.

00:03:48.128 --> 00:03:51.295
Also we were listening to people who were just boasting

00:03:52.128 --> 00:03:55.128
and were saying they know about the Truth.

00:03:55.253 --> 00:03:58.128
But when you yourself discover the Truth,

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.170
you are a different person.

00:04:01.128 --> 00:04:06.087
You discovery is so innate and so real

00:04:06.128 --> 00:04:09.128
that you discard all that is unreal.

00:04:09.212 --> 00:04:11.170
Very easily you can discard it

00:04:11.253 --> 00:04:15.128
and you don’t find it difficult to get rid of it.

00:04:16.337 --> 00:04:21.128
In this conference, as you know, we have more of Muslim people,

00:04:22.128 --> 00:04:27.128
Islamic people, who have been so much misguided all over the world.

00:04:27.253 --> 00:04:30.253
They have been told all kinds of stories

00:04:31.128 --> 00:04:34.128
and hatred among people or others.

00:04:34.337 --> 00:04:37.128
This Islamic bhoots

00:04:37.212 --> 00:04:39.212
is going from bad to worse

00:04:39.378 --> 00:04:42.128
and people want to believe in it.

00:04:42.337 --> 00:04:46.170
Especially in my country there’s a very, very big problem

00:04:47.128 --> 00:04:50.212
with this Islamic influence

00:04:50.337 --> 00:04:53.128
because they are nowhere near Islam,

00:04:53.212 --> 00:04:55.253
they have nothing to do with Mohammed-sahib,

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:58.420
but they are thinking

00:04:59.128 --> 00:05:01.337
that they are correct and what they are doing is correct.

00:05:02.212 --> 00:05:06.253
They’re trying to spread Muslim religion.

00:05:07.253 --> 00:05:10.253
What’s the use? What’s the purpose? I can’t understand.

00:05:10.337 --> 00:05:13.337
Unless and until you get your realisation,

00:05:14.128 --> 00:05:17.128
you are a useless human being, good for nothing.

00:05:17.253 --> 00:05:20.253
You can hate others, you can beat others,

00:05:20.337 --> 00:05:24.337
you can kill others and it’s going on all over the place.

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:28.337
Surprising thing that all this nonsense is going on

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:32.170
everywhere in the world in the name of Mohammed-sahib.

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:37.253
So in one shot, one side you put Christ

00:05:38.087 --> 00:05:39.295
for another crucifixion,

00:05:40.128 --> 00:05:43.212
on the other side Mohammed-sahib for his crucifixion.

00:05:43.253 --> 00:05:45.128
They cannot fight, you see.

00:05:45.212 --> 00:05:51.128
They’re on the same line. They’re on the same understanding.

00:05:51.337 --> 00:05:53.128
How can they fight? But

00:05:53.212 --> 00:05:56.170
their disciples are fighting so badly all over

00:05:56.253 --> 00:05:59.128
that sometimes it really breaks you,

00:05:59.212 --> 00:06:04.128
when you only hear about how people are fighting for nonsense.

00:06:09.295 --> 00:06:14.212
In His life, Christ did not marry.

00:06:15.337 --> 00:06:20.128
He did not and He never needed also.

00:06:20.212 --> 00:06:22.128
He did not marry.

00:06:22.212 --> 00:06:25.253
And at a very young age He was crucified.

00:06:27.128 --> 00:06:31.212
That crucifixion shows that He was not afraid of death

00:06:32.212 --> 00:06:35.087
and He knew that He would resurrect Himself.

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:39.170
This He had to do through the Agnya Chakra.

00:06:39.253 --> 00:06:41.295
Agnya Chakra is, as you know, is very constricted.

00:06:42.128 --> 00:06:45.170
And through that constriction He had to go through,

00:06:45.212 --> 00:06:48.253
for which He had to get killed.

00:06:49.128 --> 00:06:53.128
And He accepted that. He accepted

00:06:54.212 --> 00:06:59.128
with full heart that that’s the ordeal He has to go through.

00:07:00.128 --> 00:07:02.337
In the same way, your Sahasrara

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:05.128
can be only achieved through the Agnya

00:07:05.212 --> 00:07:07.212
and the Agnya has to be opened out.

00:07:08.128 --> 00:07:12.128
But for that, you don’t have to get hanged,

00:07:12.253 --> 00:07:15.128
you don’t have to be crucified,

00:07:15.253 --> 00:07:19.128
but you have to crucify your ego.

00:07:19.212 --> 00:07:21.212
The first point is ego.

00:07:22.128 --> 00:07:26.253
You have such ego that you cannot get rid of it.

00:07:27.087 --> 00:07:30.295
We have subtle and subtle ways of having egos

00:07:31.128 --> 00:07:34.128
like “I have come from this country, I must have ego,”

00:07:34.128 --> 00:07:38.128
“I come from this kind of family, I must have ego.”

00:07:38.212 --> 00:07:41.128
All kinds of stupid things they do,

00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:43.295
which are really sinful and they think

00:07:43.378 --> 00:07:45.378
they’re very great that they have ego.

00:07:46.337 --> 00:07:49.128
This ego, you have to fight,

00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:52.170
otherwise your resurrection is not possible,

00:07:52.295 --> 00:07:58.128
your attention cannot pass through the Agnya Chakra.

00:07:58.337 --> 00:08:01.337
As long as they have given us satanic identifications,

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:05.170
it will not work out. It’s a very subtle happening

00:08:05.253 --> 00:08:10.295
— very, very subtle happening — that you should see your own ego.

00:08:11.128 --> 00:08:14.128
After Realisation I said, 'You know yourself.’

00:08:14.253 --> 00:08:17.337
The first thing you will know is that you have too much of

00:08:18.128 --> 00:08:20.212
conditioning and too much of ego.

00:08:21.337 --> 00:08:25.128
Like in India, I find people have so much conditioning

00:08:25.212 --> 00:08:29.253
of their so-called rituals — very ritualistic.

00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:34.170
Everything is a ritual with them and they cannot get out of it.

00:08:34.337 --> 00:08:36.253
That’s all the conditioning is,

00:08:36.378 --> 00:08:40.253
but ego is the worst part in the West, more in the West,

00:08:40.337 --> 00:08:43.128
where I don’t know what they think of themselves.

00:08:43.337 --> 00:08:46.087
In that ego they get lost.

00:08:47.128 --> 00:08:49.337
And they cannot see what’s wrong with them,

00:08:50.128 --> 00:08:53.337
with their own community, with their own people,

00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:56.128
who claim to be some, and such and such a thing.

00:08:57.170 --> 00:09:00.212
So this ego has really dominated so much.

00:09:01.212 --> 00:09:06.087
So far in the history, so many countries, nations, have been

00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:09.420
really tortured and butchered because of the ego of some people.

00:09:11.128 --> 00:09:16.128
Once they will realise

00:09:16.253 --> 00:09:19.337
how horrible they have been, how satanic they have been,

00:09:20.212 --> 00:09:23.253
how aggressive they have been, they’ll give it up.

00:09:23.337 --> 00:09:26.337
But they have to realise and, for that, I said,

00:09:27.128 --> 00:09:28.378
'You have to have your resurrection.’

00:09:29.212 --> 00:09:32.253
Without the resurrection, you will not know at all,

00:09:33.128 --> 00:09:36.253
you’ll not be conscious of what wrong you have been doing.

00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:41.337
It is very, very surprising how people go on doing wrong things,

00:09:42.128 --> 00:09:45.253
advertise them and come out as egos.

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:50.087
When I read the newspapers, I say,

00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:52.212
'These are all stupid people all around.’

00:09:53.087 --> 00:09:56.337
— absolutely very, very

00:09:58.253 --> 00:10:01.253
stupid in the sense that they have no understanding

00:10:01.337 --> 00:10:05.253
of what they are doing. They are just killing people,

00:10:05.378 --> 00:10:10.128
enjoying the killing and they’re so violent it is impossible

00:10:10.212 --> 00:10:14.337
to understand what sort of life they are going to have

00:10:15.128 --> 00:10:17.170
after death – even before death.

00:10:18.295 --> 00:10:21.337
In this whole thing, you see the whole picture of the world.

00:10:22.128 --> 00:10:26.170
You’ll find all such countries who are still fighting for nonsense

00:10:26.295 --> 00:10:28.253
are very, very poor,

00:10:29.128 --> 00:10:31.128
are having very bad time

00:10:31.253 --> 00:10:36.253
and they are about to be completely finished.

00:10:37.212 --> 00:10:39.212
But they don’t want to see why they are suffering,

00:10:39.337 --> 00:10:41.337
why what’s happening, what is the problem.

00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:47.212
In the countries where there are affluence, lots of affluence,

00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:53.212
they also got lost. They too need resurrection.

00:10:54.253 --> 00:10:57.170
They have to rise above materialism

00:10:57.253 --> 00:11:00.253
and see for themselves what they’re doing is wrong.

00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:03.337
They are like, actually, cheats.

00:11:04.128 --> 00:11:06.337
They are cheating the society all the time.

00:11:07.128 --> 00:11:09.128
I think the whole economics is based

00:11:09.212 --> 00:11:13.128
on cheating, how you can cheat people. And in that cheating,

00:11:13.295 --> 00:11:15.420
you don’t even realise that you are doing something

00:11:16.212 --> 00:11:18.253
to make people so insecure.

00:11:19.128 --> 00:11:25.087
So this money business, also, is such that

00:11:25.212 --> 00:11:28.253
it makes you very greedy and you start giving too much importance to money.

00:11:33.128 --> 00:11:37.128
This is one thing to be understood from the life of Christ.

00:11:37.337 --> 00:11:43.337
He was a very simple, poor man, son of a carpenter.

00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:50.128
And to Him, money was nothing but an absolutely useless thing.

00:11:50.337 --> 00:11:52.337
To Him, Spirit was everything.

00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:55.420
And He was preaching and telling people

00:11:56.128 --> 00:11:59.462
that You must have spiritual awakening. Very important.

00:12:00.128 --> 00:12:03.087
Try to understand that there is life

00:12:03.253 --> 00:12:06.295
beyond all this and then you should get

00:12:07.128 --> 00:12:12.253
the best results out of this life,

00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:14.337
which you are just wasting.’

00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:17.337
He was so intelligent and

00:12:17.462 --> 00:12:23.087
the way He discussed with all those great fathers from the Church

00:12:23.212 --> 00:12:25.253
about the religion and all that,

00:12:26.337 --> 00:12:28.545
it’s amazing how a little boy

00:12:28.629 --> 00:12:33.128
could understand so deeply about religion.

00:12:34.504 --> 00:12:37.420
He was a small boy at that time, no doubt,

00:12:38.212 --> 00:12:44.128
but He was a person from the Divine, created by the Divine.

00:12:44.504 --> 00:12:48.420
He was Shri Ganesha. He’s Aum. He’s knowledge, everything.

00:12:50.087 --> 00:12:52.420
Despite that, nobody people recognised Him

00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:55.420
because they cannot recognise the Truth.

00:12:56.253 --> 00:12:58.253
They cannot understand the Truth.

00:12:59.212 --> 00:13:03.087
They are so stupid that they can only

00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:06.295
take to something that is falsehood, that is bad.

00:13:06.462 --> 00:13:09.420
And ultimately they crucified Him.

00:13:10.378 --> 00:13:14.128
This is a funny world where saints are crucified

00:13:14.337 --> 00:13:18.087
and the devils are given so much importance.

00:13:19.128 --> 00:13:21.027
But now the time has come

00:13:21.253 --> 00:13:25.253
for all these people who are doing wrong,

00:13:26.128 --> 00:13:30.128
who are trying to strangle others, will be strangled.

00:13:31.253 --> 00:13:35.253
They will be all exposed.I’ve told you this is the year of exposure.

00:13:35.462 --> 00:13:39.420
They’ll be all exposed if they are doing all such things

00:13:40.087 --> 00:13:42.295
of aggression and of greed.

00:13:42.462 --> 00:13:46.128
All their greed will be completely exposed

00:13:46.253 --> 00:13:48.170
and they will be thrown into hell.

00:13:48.295 --> 00:13:52.128
This is what I felt for this year especially.

00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:56.420
This has to happen, so best thing is to take to your resurrection,

00:13:57.128 --> 00:14:00.295
take to your higher life

00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:03.128
and see for yourself 'What are you doing?’

00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:05.420
What is the greatest thing to have?

00:14:06.253 --> 00:14:10.253
Money? Power? It doesn’t help anyone.

00:14:11.128 --> 00:14:13.212
People don’t have great name with that.

00:14:13.378 --> 00:14:16.337
Nobody remembers anybody who’s a drunkard.

00:14:17.253 --> 00:14:19.295
They don’t have statues of the drunkard people.

00:14:23.128 --> 00:14:26.128
So who achieves something higher?

00:14:26.462 --> 00:14:31.462
Who achieves great name like Christ?

00:14:32.378 --> 00:14:35.337
Those who have sacrificed their lives

00:14:36.128 --> 00:14:40.212
for the betterment of humanity, for helping them.

00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:42.378
Why did they do it?

00:14:43.212 --> 00:14:46.253
Because they loved human beings.

00:14:46.462 --> 00:14:49.128
They loved human being.

00:14:49.253 --> 00:14:53.128
When you love others, then you start thinking about

00:14:53.337 --> 00:14:57.378
‘what is the best, what can you do the best for them?’

00:14:58.128 --> 00:15:00.253
Now there are parents who are ignorant.

00:15:00.378 --> 00:15:03.253
They don’t know what to do for their children,

00:15:04.128 --> 00:15:09.420
so they try to dazzle the children with

00:15:09.587 --> 00:15:13.420
lots of things and food and this and that.

00:15:14.128 --> 00:15:17.128
But children, if they are not brought up with love,

00:15:17.462 --> 00:15:21.420
they’ll have no consideration whatsoever.They’ll go astray.

00:15:23.253 --> 00:15:26.420
But, in case they know somebody loves,

00:15:27.128 --> 00:15:29.545
for that love’s sake they will not go astray.

00:15:30.128 --> 00:15:31.337
They will not do wrong things.

00:15:31.462 --> 00:15:33.504
So the greatest thing about

00:15:34.212 --> 00:15:38.295
Christ or anyone of these great people is that they loved.

00:15:39.212 --> 00:15:43.212
They loved the people. They loved all human beings.

00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:46.378
That is what we have to know.

00:15:47.128 --> 00:15:50.420
Do we love ourselves, only our families,

00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:55.253
only our country? Or [do] we love the whole world?

00:15:56.253 --> 00:16:01.253
Do we live for the whole world or we live only for our limited circles.

00:16:02.128 --> 00:16:05.128
We should find out 'What are our aspirations?

00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:09.378
What are our desires? What do we want to have?’

00:16:10.212 --> 00:16:14.212
If you are really thinking of other people

00:16:15.378 --> 00:16:17.420
as your own, with love,

00:16:18.253 --> 00:16:23.253
it’s so joy giving. You may have any amount of ornaments,

00:16:23.378 --> 00:16:27.253
may have any amount of houses, any property, any money,

00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:29.253
you may have any power,

00:16:29.378 --> 00:16:32.128
you might be the prime minister of this

00:16:32.253 --> 00:16:34.212
or the prime minister of another,

00:16:34.504 --> 00:16:37.462
but if you have no love for others,

00:16:38.128 --> 00:16:39.420
you cannot enjoy yourself.

00:16:40.253 --> 00:16:43.212
Your enjoyment only comes through love,

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:45.462
that your capacity to love.

00:16:46.253 --> 00:16:49.128
There’s no other way you can enjoy yourself.

00:16:49.337 --> 00:16:52.462
You may have television, you may have music

00:16:53.128 --> 00:16:55.295
you may go for dinner parties, everything,

00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:58.337
but still nothing penetrates.

00:16:59.253 --> 00:17:03.253
Nothing is there to give you real joy.

00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:05.420
That’s what Christ has taught us,

00:17:06.087 --> 00:17:09.087
that He had love for all the human beings

00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:13.420
and He wanted to prepare them for the Resurrection.

00:17:14.504 --> 00:17:17.462
He came before Sahaja Yoga came in.

00:17:18.337 --> 00:17:21.420
If He had not done that job,

00:17:22.128 --> 00:17:25.128
it would have been difficult for Me to achieve it.

00:17:25.337 --> 00:17:28.253
So He had prepared the stage for Sahaja Yoga.

00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:31.128
That now your Agnyas are opened

00:17:32.337 --> 00:17:37.337
and through the Agnya you can take the Kundalini upward

00:17:37.504 --> 00:17:42.504
through the Sahasrara and open the fontanel bone area.

00:17:43.253 --> 00:17:49.253
All this He thought of was a part and parcel of His love for people.

00:17:49.504 --> 00:17:53.212
And that’s what He did. And He cared for so many people.

00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:56.128
He’s such a help to us in Sahaja Yoga.

00:17:56.295 --> 00:17:58.170
Without Him, I don’t know

00:17:56.295 --> 00:17:58.253
how could I have really broken the Agnya Chakra.

00:18:03.170 --> 00:18:06.170
Because, as you know, Agnya is such a horrible thing.

00:18:07.337 --> 00:18:09.587
People go on doing wrong things through Agnya

00:18:10.170 --> 00:18:12.378
and they never feel bad about it,

00:18:13.253 --> 00:18:15.337
never think they have done anything wrong,

00:18:15.545 --> 00:18:18.587
they have harmed anyone, they have tortured anybody

00:18:19.170 --> 00:18:20.504
or they have made others cry.

00:18:21.170 --> 00:18:25.420
They go on with their Agnya, but they have no heart

00:18:26.128 --> 00:18:28.378
to feel what they have been up to.

00:18:29.253 --> 00:18:33.170
It’s Christ only. He shows us that you break your Agnya,

00:18:33.545 --> 00:18:35.420
pass through your Agnya.

00:18:35.587 --> 00:18:37.587
Here they call it as a third eye.

00:18:38.128 --> 00:18:40.420
The other day one lady came with a magazine of 'Third Eye’

00:18:41.087 --> 00:18:43.295
and when I told her what it is she was surprised.

00:18:44.170 --> 00:18:46.420
If your third eye is to be opened means

00:18:46.629 --> 00:18:50.378
Christ is to be awakened within you, on your Agnya.

00:18:51.170 --> 00:18:54.253
That’s the third eye. Now what He does by —

00:18:55.170 --> 00:18:57.212
He creates a witness state within you.

00:18:58.337 --> 00:19:00.378
You become the witness of the whole drama.

00:19:01.212 --> 00:19:03.253
You start seeing the whole drama

00:19:03.504 --> 00:19:07.420
and you are amazed how you are silent,

00:19:08.128 --> 00:19:10.128
thoughtlessly aware

00:19:10.337 --> 00:19:13.337
and how you are seeing everything without reacting.

00:19:14.337 --> 00:19:18.295
This is where we have to believe that Christ has taken

00:19:18.462 --> 00:19:21.420
His form in our Agnya.

00:19:22.128 --> 00:19:23.253
His birth is there.

00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:25.253
His resurrection is there,

00:19:25.337 --> 00:19:28.420
all that we have got it already, worked it out.

00:19:29.212 --> 00:19:33.128
Like a machinery, the whole being’s made

00:19:33.337 --> 00:19:36.337
and we have different, different chakras and centres.

00:19:36.504 --> 00:19:39.253
This is the last, most difficult centre,

00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:45.420
which was really opened out by Jesus Christ.

00:19:46.128 --> 00:19:50.212
He’s the one who dared it and who did it so beautifully

00:19:50.378 --> 00:19:55.170
that we too have now capacity to look at our ego,

00:19:55.337 --> 00:19:58.170
to see for ourselves, ‡What are we doing?

00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:02.295
Why do we think we are something very exceptional?’

00:20:03.170 --> 00:20:06.170
Once you start seeing the ego, you will be amazed.

00:20:06.337 --> 00:20:10.253
Whatever work you may do, whatever you may do, you’ll never be tired

00:20:11.253 --> 00:20:14.128
We get tired because all the time ego is saying,

00:20:14.212 --> 00:20:16.170
'Oh, you are so great.

00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:19.212
You are doing so much work for others.

00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:22.128
You have achieved so much,’ all that.

00:20:22.253 --> 00:20:26.212
So then the ego goes on all the time

00:20:26.295 --> 00:20:30.295
pointing out all this false greatness about us

00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:34.212
and we get tired that 'We are so great and why should we work?

00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:36.128
Why should we help others?’

00:20:36.253 --> 00:20:40.462
Like that, funny ideas start crawling in our mind

00:20:41.128 --> 00:20:45.253
and what we do is that we feel very tired out.

00:20:46.337 --> 00:20:49.295
Fighting with those ideas, we feel very tired.

00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:52.337
Now, our whole situation

00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:57.378
is made much simpler by the life of Christ.

00:20:58.087 --> 00:21:02.128
But look at the Christian nations. They are juxtaposition.

00:21:02.462 --> 00:21:06.420
They are on the other side of Christ’s teachings.

00:21:07.128 --> 00:21:09.128
They are the most aggressive countries.

00:21:10.212 --> 00:21:13.420
They aggress people so much

00:21:14.253 --> 00:21:17.337
that in the whole world they are regarded as something

00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:22.128
very great and like they’re the kings or something.

00:21:22.253 --> 00:21:26.128
I know this because we were in slavery in India

00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:30.504
and I was surprised that these people came from outside

00:21:31.212 --> 00:21:33.128
and were nicely become master.

00:21:33.504 --> 00:21:37.378
They were masters and used to treat us so badly,

00:21:38.128 --> 00:21:42.128
used to really make slaves out of us.

00:21:43.128 --> 00:21:49.337
So the slavery started and then all such things started in India,

00:21:49.504 --> 00:21:51.420
as well as abroad.

00:21:52.128 --> 00:21:54.128
Everywhere people started thinking

00:21:54.253 --> 00:21:56.337
that they are great – and they were Christians.

00:21:57.170 --> 00:22:01.128
They used to go to church and from the church what did you learn?

00:22:01.212 --> 00:22:04.128
How to dominate others, how to show them down,

00:22:04.337 --> 00:22:08.420
how to take away all that belongs

00:22:09.212 --> 00:22:12.420
to the poorer people or to the less stronger people.

00:22:14.212 --> 00:22:16.212
It’s a thing we have seen ourselves.

00:22:16.504 --> 00:22:21.462
So this happens to people who have this ego, very, very powerful.

00:22:22.128 --> 00:22:24.462
And they try to take over

00:22:26.253 --> 00:22:28.253
things that belong to other countries.

00:22:28.378 --> 00:22:31.253
What right have they got to take somebody’s country,

00:22:31.378 --> 00:22:33.337
I can’t understand.

00:22:56.023 --> 00:23:01.065
All these complications are there.

00:23:01.898 --> 00:23:04.898
In the modern time they’re the worst.

00:23:05.065 --> 00:23:07.981
It was never so bad as it is today.

00:23:08.731 --> 00:23:13.731
We had Hitler. We had people of that kind once in a while.

00:23:13.856 --> 00:23:16.815
But the whole world was together on one side.

00:23:16.898 --> 00:23:18.898
Nobody was confused.

00:23:19.856 --> 00:23:24.731
Nobody knew that you have to fight all the time.

00:23:24.856 --> 00:23:28.023
Now, maybe because of newspapers, I don’t know why,

00:23:28.856 --> 00:23:31.815
nobody knows which side is correct, which is not correct.

00:23:32.107 --> 00:23:35.023
It’s being such a dispute about everything

00:23:35.773 --> 00:23:38.856
and people don’t try to understand the reality of the problem.

00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:43.107
And they are killing left and right all kinds of people.

00:23:43.815 --> 00:23:45.856
It is very surprising how,

00:23:46.856 --> 00:23:49.773
in this world, human beings are killing

00:23:49.898 --> 00:23:51.898
each other much more than the animals do.

00:23:53.731 --> 00:23:57.023
We are the worst, worse than the animals,

00:23:57.898 --> 00:24:04.856
that we are killing ourselves, our own clan, our own people.

00:24:05.731 --> 00:24:08.023
In India also we are surprised how

00:24:08.815 --> 00:24:11.731
they are killing — Kashmiris are killing Kashmiris.

00:24:14.773 --> 00:24:16.981
In the same way, everywhere you go, you find

00:24:17.023 --> 00:24:19.023
they are fighting among themselves.

00:24:19.690 --> 00:24:21.690
If you go to Africa, you will be surprised how

00:24:21.815 --> 00:24:23.023
they are fighting among themselves.

00:24:23.773 --> 00:24:27.856
I mean, now the principle of fighting has come up very strong

00:24:28.731 --> 00:24:31.981
and people think fighting is a very important part of human beings.

00:24:32.815 --> 00:24:35.856
Anything you say, immediately fighting will start.

00:24:36.856 --> 00:24:40.023
Now look at Christ and His life.

00:24:40.773 --> 00:24:43.940
He didn’t fight anyone. He didn’t argue with anyone

00:24:44.773 --> 00:24:49.856
and He accepted, accepted the death on the cross.

00:24:51.023 --> 00:24:53.815
He accepted it because He knew

00:24:53.981 --> 00:24:55.940
that it is for the resurrection,

00:24:56.731 --> 00:24:59.065
for not only His, [but] for the resurrection of the whole world.

00:25:00.023 --> 00:25:01.981
And this is what we have to learn.

00:25:02.107 --> 00:25:05.023
We have to be the models of resurrection.

00:25:05.856 --> 00:25:07.856
We see all these things happening,

00:25:08.023 --> 00:25:10.023
we’re upset also about it

00:25:10.856 --> 00:25:13.856
and when after Realisation

00:25:14.065 --> 00:25:17.023
people see that surroundings are full of this,

00:25:17.731 --> 00:25:20.023
their own people are like this, they start fighting

00:25:20.731 --> 00:25:23.940
for nothing at all and they realise

00:25:24.731 --> 00:25:27.815
that 'These are my own people who are doing this nonsense.’

00:25:28.023 --> 00:25:30.023
You can’t correct it. You can’t do anything.

00:25:31.023 --> 00:25:35.773
But if your Agnya is clear, if your ego is finished,

00:25:35.856 --> 00:25:42.107
if there is no domination of any kind in your mind

00:25:43.023 --> 00:25:45.773
– and also [if] your conditioning is finished,

00:25:46.023 --> 00:25:50.731
then you become the channel of creating peace.

00:25:51.731 --> 00:25:55.731
You are the one, wherever you are, you can create peace.

00:25:56.065 --> 00:26:00.731
This is something, a special thing for Sahaja Yogis to know,

00:26:00.898 --> 00:26:04.981
that if you have no Agnya, you may look like you are suffering,

00:26:05.107 --> 00:26:08.023
but you are not. You are doing it for others,

00:26:08.731 --> 00:26:13.023
for surroundings, for your friends, for your neighbours,

00:26:13.815 --> 00:26:16.023
you can say for your countrymen, for all of them.

00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:18.940
When you have no Agnya

00:26:19.731 --> 00:26:24.023
you become such a big source of Divine Force

00:26:24.731 --> 00:26:26.731
that it can work out anything.

00:26:27.898 --> 00:26:30.898
It can change, transform people.

00:26:32.856 --> 00:26:35.940
It can happen like that and

00:26:36.731 --> 00:26:39.107
it has happened to many people before, individually.

00:26:39.856 --> 00:26:43.815
But now collectively I’m sure all this anger,

00:26:43.940 --> 00:26:46.856
all this temperament of aggression

00:26:47.023 --> 00:26:49.023
and all these challenges

00:26:49.856 --> 00:26:53.773
from all these nasty people can be brought to an end.

00:26:54.107 --> 00:26:57.731
with the people who have no ego,

00:26:58.773 --> 00:27:02.815
with the people who are not justifying their wrong things,

00:27:03.856 --> 00:27:09.856
with the people who have a clear cut idea as to what is the Truth.

00:27:11.023 --> 00:27:13.940
They may speak. They may not speak. It makes no difference.

00:27:14.773 --> 00:27:17.856
Whatever they are, but they are such a big shield

00:27:18.815 --> 00:27:20.815
against those aggressive forces,

00:27:21.023 --> 00:27:23.065
which are ruining the peace of the world.

00:27:24.023 --> 00:27:26.065
So Christ did it for the peace,

00:27:26.898 --> 00:27:28.856
to bring peace on this Earth.

00:27:29.023 --> 00:27:32.023
It’s very important there should be peace,

00:27:32.731 --> 00:27:35.023
but if there is no peace within, how can you have peace outside.

00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:38.981
It’s very surprising how so many countries

00:27:39.023 --> 00:27:43.023
who talk of peace are engaged in wars and fighting.

00:27:43.731 --> 00:27:44.940
How can you have like that?

00:27:45.815 --> 00:27:47.940
They have no solution. They don’t understand.

00:27:48.731 --> 00:27:54.815
The only solution I find is to transform them in Sahaja Yoga.

00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:56.023
That’s the only one.

00:27:56.731 --> 00:27:58.731
You have to take out their ego.

00:27:58.815 --> 00:28:01.690
You can see in many people, it resists.

00:28:02.023 --> 00:28:03.981
It is there, is working.

00:28:04.107 --> 00:28:08.690
This ego is a very, very dangerous thing people have.

00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:11.898
So this one was the one

00:28:12.731 --> 00:28:17.731
which was really handled by Jesus.

00:28:18.065 --> 00:28:22.065
He tried to neutralise your ego.

00:28:24.898 --> 00:28:31.023
He tried to take out the problems of the ego

00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:34.981
to make you a humble, mild personality.

00:28:35.773 --> 00:28:38.731
To say that a humble and mild person

00:28:38.856 --> 00:28:42.856
is always into a danger is a wrong thing to say.

00:28:43.856 --> 00:28:48.856
See them. When the people are aggressive

00:28:49.773 --> 00:28:51.815
and people are trying to dominate,

00:28:53.023 --> 00:28:57.065
the humble man is the winner, not the one who dominates.

00:29:22.333 --> 00:29:29.249
So main thing is now to watch out for

00:29:29.541 --> 00:29:32.583
your Mr. Ego, how it works. It’s very interesting,

00:29:33.541 --> 00:29:36.583
very interesting to see how it makes a drama.

00:29:37.333 --> 00:29:39.374
how it tries to cover up things,

00:29:39.541 --> 00:29:43.416
how he tries to show that you are superior to others.

00:29:43.541 --> 00:29:47.541
It is to be seen. It is to be seen very clearly

00:29:48.249 --> 00:29:51.374
what this Agnya is up to.

00:29:52.583 --> 00:29:55.666
It’s a very, very mischievous thing,

00:29:56.249 --> 00:30:00.249
very harmful thing and most embarrassing also.

00:30:00.666 --> 00:30:03.333
So these egoistical people are

00:30:03.499 --> 00:30:06.541
like that and ultimately they become nervous people

00:30:07.541 --> 00:30:10.541
— very nervous and think no end of themselves.

00:30:11.249 --> 00:30:13.249
First they try to control others.

00:30:13.708 --> 00:30:18.416
But then they are needed to be controlled they are like that

00:30:18.541 --> 00:30:22.666
because they are all the time trying to control others

00:30:23.249 --> 00:30:25.458
and they don’t know how to control themselves.

00:30:28.458 --> 00:30:30.499
Who is the child crying so much?

00:30:31.625 --> 00:30:33.583
Why is he crying?

00:30:43.666 --> 00:30:45.666
Must be something wrong.

00:30:49.374 --> 00:30:52.574
Normally children keep very quiet in my lecture.

00:31:02.941 --> 00:31:05.983
Now this ego is also like this child.

00:31:06.983 --> 00:31:09.983
It doesn’t hear anything, doesn’t understand anything.

00:31:10.191 --> 00:31:13.233
It just goes on disturbing everything.

00:31:14.066 --> 00:31:16.150
In the same way, our ego also behaves,

00:31:16.816 --> 00:31:19.858
without having any collective knowledge, without having

00:31:20.024 --> 00:31:23.108
'What are you up to? What you are doing?

00:31:23.774 --> 00:31:27.275
Who, are you harming?’ Nothing, just a satisfaction,

00:31:27.858 --> 00:31:31.108
such a blind satisfaction that you are doing something

00:31:31.774 --> 00:31:33.066
to assert your personality.

00:31:34.024 --> 00:31:36.858
You see, if you just watch your ego, you’ll laugh

00:31:37.108 --> 00:31:40.108
and enjoy the buffoon, you’ll see what a thing it is.

00:31:40.275 --> 00:31:42.191
‘It has been befooling me so much,

00:31:42.774 --> 00:31:46.233
what a horrible thing this ego was.’

00:31:46.983 --> 00:31:48.983
At the time when Christ was there,

00:31:49.191 --> 00:31:51.233
the people have such a lot of ego.

00:31:51.774 --> 00:31:54.733
Nobody talked about it. Nobody said anything.

00:31:55.983 --> 00:31:58.816
So this was the best way that He could show us

00:31:59.191 --> 00:32:03.275
that you can break your Agnya by sacrificing your life

00:32:03.899 --> 00:32:05.899
— not in Sahaja Yoga, not in Sahaja Yoga.

00:32:06.774 --> 00:32:08.774
But in a way, in Sahaja Yoga also,

00:32:09.316 --> 00:32:13.108
if you have an ego you should first of all have witness state.

00:32:13.774 --> 00:32:16.275
It’s the other way round. If you have ego,

00:32:16.442 --> 00:32:20.066
you cannot have witness state. If you cannot have witness state,

00:32:20.275 --> 00:32:25.150
you cannot improve your ego. It’s a very confusing thing.

00:32:25.733 --> 00:32:29.774
Now supposing you develop a very big ego,

00:32:31.233 --> 00:32:33.275
then you go on justifying it all the time.

00:32:34.275 --> 00:32:36.400
You think, ‘Whatever I have done is good. After all,

00:32:36.941 --> 00:32:40.024
it’s very good for everyone, good for me.’

00:32:40.358 --> 00:32:42.275
Self certification starts.

00:32:42.899 --> 00:32:44.983
With that, you can never see

00:32:45.191 --> 00:32:47.191
what you are doing to yourself,

00:32:47.858 --> 00:32:49.150
what you are doing to others.

00:32:49.816 --> 00:32:52.941
It’s something, such a blind-folded nonsense.

00:32:53.899 --> 00:32:57.150
When this ego comes up in that way,

00:32:57.899 --> 00:33:02.400
then, I mean, we can have Hitlers, we can have all kinds of things.

00:33:02.941 --> 00:33:07.150
Any small point they take and form a group of people

00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:10.233
doing this kind of thing – anything.

00:33:10.442 --> 00:33:14.233
They will say that ‘Now, we are people who are spiritual.

00:33:14.858 --> 00:33:17.733
So we have a group and we are spiritual people

00:33:17.983 --> 00:33:20.191
and whatever we do is the right.’

00:33:20.983 --> 00:33:25.941
But who says it is right? By what law is it right?

00:33:26.191 --> 00:33:29.816
And we have had so many cults and this like that,

00:33:29.983 --> 00:33:33.150
everywhere, where people joined them, kill themselves,

00:33:33.358 --> 00:33:37.316
had all kinds of problems. How can that be spirituality?

00:33:38.024 --> 00:33:41.983
In spirituality the first and foremost thing is

00:33:42.233 --> 00:33:47.024
that the person becomes very meek, very humble,

00:33:48.774 --> 00:33:53.774
very humble. His heart — humility is the power.

00:33:54.899 --> 00:33:57.233
His humility is the one that works

00:33:58.358 --> 00:34:01.358
and his humility is the one that glorifies.

00:34:02.191 --> 00:34:04.150
It is not the aggression.

00:34:04.941 --> 00:34:08.941
See, Hitler came and died. Who worships him?

00:34:09.816 --> 00:34:13.816
Others also came. Like Mussolini came, died. Who worships?

00:34:14.442 --> 00:34:17.400
There are so many like that who came and went away.

00:34:17.858 --> 00:34:22.899
They don’t even want to have their statues, so bad as they were.

00:34:23.358 --> 00:34:28.191
So those who have this ego are really very stupid people

00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:31.108
in the sense that they do all wrong,

00:34:31.275 --> 00:34:33.191
thinking it is the right thing to do.

00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:37.400
Ultimately, they are recognised as absolutely

00:34:38.358 --> 00:34:41.275
very, very wrong type of people.

00:34:42.899 --> 00:34:45.024
People don’t want to take their names even.

00:34:46.066 --> 00:34:50.150
So the time can prove what are they and what they’re doing.

00:34:51.233 --> 00:34:57.024
It’s a very, very calculated work of the Divine.

00:34:58.816 --> 00:35:01.275
You shouldn’t play into the hands of your ego.

00:35:01.941 --> 00:35:05.108
Try to see yourself. ‘Oh, Mr Ego, so you are there.’

00:35:05.858 --> 00:35:10.858
Try to watch. And that time, if you take the name of Jesus,

00:35:11.233 --> 00:35:14.733
ego will go away. Just say

00:35:16.316 --> 00:35:22.066
the mantra of Jesus and ego will disappear.

00:35:25.024 --> 00:35:32.108
Another side of this horrible ego is the conditioning.

00:35:33.024 --> 00:35:37.024
That also has a very, very, very subtle ego.

00:35:37.733 --> 00:35:42.733
For example, supposing if somebody comes to your house

00:35:43.816 --> 00:35:48.275
and starts saying that ‘Ah, what a dirty carpet.

00:35:48.858 --> 00:35:51.899
I don’t like this colour. That thing I don’t like’

00:35:52.316 --> 00:35:55.316
without understanding that you are hurting another person.

00:35:56.233 --> 00:35:58.275
Talking like that, he comes inside.

00:35:59.275 --> 00:36:03.941
And then, you see how stupid he has been

00:36:04.275 --> 00:36:07.941
because nobody likes such a person who is talking like that.

00:36:08.233 --> 00:36:10.983
But to him, it is very important

00:36:11.191 --> 00:36:15.233
that he should correct because he has a conditioning

00:36:16.024 --> 00:36:18.858
that a particular type of carpet is good,

00:36:19.108 --> 00:36:22.941
the another is not. That conditioning works.

00:36:23.108 --> 00:36:25.108
And he goes on talking nonsense

00:36:25.275 --> 00:36:27.316
that ‘This is not good, that is not good.’

00:36:39.112 --> 00:36:40.529
You cannot enjoy anything.

00:36:41.571 --> 00:36:43.488
You cannot enjoy anything.

00:36:44.071 --> 00:36:48.112
You go to any home, you don’t like it because there’s conditioning.

00:36:48.279 --> 00:36:50.237
You know of something else which is good.

00:36:50.738 --> 00:36:53.154
No – so they can’t enjoy.

00:36:53.529 --> 00:36:57.488
Everything they decide on their conditioning.

00:36:57.696 --> 00:36:59.654
[There] Is nothing independent.

00:37:00.404 --> 00:37:04.321
It has nothing to do with the intrinsic personality.

00:37:04.613 --> 00:37:07.529
Intrinsic value of that thing.

00:37:08.404 --> 00:37:12.446
Just like that, 'Oh, I don’t like it.’ It’s not good.

00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:15.738
It should not be said by Sahaja Yogis.

00:37:16.196 --> 00:37:18.196
Never use this word.

00:37:18.488 --> 00:37:21.488
You can find out from Me. I never do that.

00:37:22.571 --> 00:37:25.362
Whatever it is I say, it’s all right.

00:37:25.571 --> 00:37:27.529
I never criticize it.

00:37:28.196 --> 00:37:31.696
This criticism business comes from this conditioning

00:37:32.279 --> 00:37:34.196
because you have had such conditioning.

00:37:34.362 --> 00:37:37.404
Supposing you are an Englishman you have English conditioning.

00:37:38.196 --> 00:37:42.654
Now, correction comes.

00:37:43.446 --> 00:37:47.404
Their cows got this disease.

00:37:48.154 --> 00:37:51.696
How did they get the disease when you are such perfect people?

00:37:53.488 --> 00:37:57.446
Then in Europe the animals got one disease.

00:37:57.654 --> 00:37:59.321
How is it they got

00:37:59.529 --> 00:38:03.488
this disease when you think you are the cleanest people living ever?

00:38:05.071 --> 00:38:06.488
Just watch out why?

00:38:07.237 --> 00:38:09.362
It’s all their own conditioning

00:38:10.112 --> 00:38:13.738
that ‘We know everything. We are the best in the whole world

00:38:14.237 --> 00:38:18.112
and we have a right to rule everyone.’ Now have it.

00:38:18.613 --> 00:38:22.696
Now those who were very rich people, like America and all that,

00:38:23.613 --> 00:38:26.154
used to think no end of themselves.

00:38:26.446 --> 00:38:28.196
Now what has happened?

00:38:28.738 --> 00:38:33.696
Suddenly it has become a country where everybody has to pity.

00:38:34.321 --> 00:38:37.279
Why? What is the reason? Why suddenly it has happened?

00:38:37.696 --> 00:38:41.237
It’s always the nature which corrects you

00:38:41.654 --> 00:38:43.696
by giving the other side of it.

00:38:45.112 --> 00:38:47.321
Anything you try to boast of

00:38:47.613 --> 00:38:50.613
or you try to put your conditioning of others, it repels,

00:38:51.321 --> 00:38:52.529
it comes up on you.

00:38:53.780 --> 00:38:57.654
It works in such a great manner that you can’t imagine.

00:38:58.613 --> 00:39:02.196
And then it does not work out,

00:39:02.404 --> 00:39:07.321
then there are earthquakes. All kinds of calamities come in.

00:39:08.654 --> 00:39:12.237
There were a group of people who were white-skinned

00:39:13.362 --> 00:39:18.571
near the River Mississippi. And they were called as rednecks

00:39:19.112 --> 00:39:22.112
because it was always hot, their necks were always hot,

00:39:22.362 --> 00:39:25.237
they were such angry, hot-tempered people.

00:39:26.071 --> 00:39:30.071
And these rednecks were known to be very cruel.

00:39:30.362 --> 00:39:34.196
They used to kill people and put the blame on some other

00:39:34.404 --> 00:39:39.404
people from aboriginal people and arrest them and destroy them.

00:39:40.446 --> 00:39:42.529
It went on and on and on.

00:39:43.196 --> 00:39:46.196
But one day this Mississippi got flooded,

00:39:46.780 --> 00:39:52.237
so much flooded it entered all the houses of these rednecks, you see

00:39:52.738 --> 00:39:54.654
and I saw them running away

00:39:55.154 --> 00:39:58.154
with all their belongings which they could not carry also.

00:39:58.404 --> 00:40:01.404
Some of they were leaving behind, some they were running

00:40:01.613 --> 00:40:03.696
and, while running also, they were losing it.

00:40:04.154 --> 00:40:07.154
Like that, the whole chaos took place of these rednecks.

00:40:07.488 --> 00:40:10.196
And now, I am told, they are much better.

00:40:10.738 --> 00:40:15.321
All that nonsense they had of killing all the black people and

00:40:15.529 --> 00:40:18.112
torturing them, now has come on their heads.

00:40:18.321 --> 00:40:20.571
Mississippi has taught them a lesson.

00:40:21.196 --> 00:40:25.196
So how the nature also doesn’t like conditioned people

00:40:26.112 --> 00:40:30.738
— conditioning is creating a big problem now, even now,

00:40:31.196 --> 00:40:33.237
in all the countries, like racialism.

00:40:34.696 --> 00:40:37.654
Racialism is a very bad conditioning.

00:40:38.488 --> 00:40:42.196
I mean, if somebody’s black or white or red, what does it matter?

00:40:42.738 --> 00:40:44.696
God has made that person.

00:40:45.529 --> 00:40:47.529
I always say that in America,

00:40:48.112 --> 00:40:50.738
if they remove all the people who are not white-skinned,

00:40:51.237 --> 00:40:52.696
what will be left there?

00:40:53.529 --> 00:40:56.529
They don’t know how to sing,. They don’t know how to play.

00:40:57.196 --> 00:40:59.571
They don’t know how to operate.

00:41:00.154 --> 00:41:03.237
All the Indian doctors and Indian nurses will come away

00:41:03.446 --> 00:41:05.404
and what will they do?

00:41:06.196 --> 00:41:09.738
Imagine, thinking no end of themselves, they are great racists.

00:41:10.237 --> 00:41:13.362
Even now, they are, but gradually they’ll definitely improve

00:41:13.571 --> 00:41:15.529
because they should know their deficiencies.

00:41:16.071 --> 00:41:20.112
This world is one and you need people from every country

00:41:20.321 --> 00:41:23.071
to help each other. But this conditioning of

00:41:23.321 --> 00:41:25.404
thinking themselves to be something great

00:41:25.696 --> 00:41:29.654
the very bad conditioning. It is the mixture of ego

00:41:30.112 --> 00:41:33.654
with conditioning, conditioning giving the ego

00:41:34.529 --> 00:41:36.488
that ‘we are the best.’

00:41:36.780 --> 00:41:40.696
But I am very happy to know that after Realisation,

00:41:41.446 --> 00:41:45.404
it so happens, with this resurrection,

00:41:45.696 --> 00:41:50.696
Sahaja Yogis start thinking, understanding

00:41:51.362 --> 00:41:54.362
what is wrong in their own community,

00:41:55.488 --> 00:41:59.529
what is the mistake they have been committing.

00:42:00.112 --> 00:42:03.154
They just become like that — alert.

00:42:03.362 --> 00:42:05.154
And they start telling

00:42:05.279 --> 00:42:08.279
they are the ones who are doing this kind of nonsense.

00:42:08.404 --> 00:42:10.529
Imagine. It is very surprising

00:42:11.196 --> 00:42:15.196
how you become conscious of the defects of your own country.

00:42:15.488 --> 00:42:17.446
It is so important, is Agnya.

00:42:17.613 --> 00:42:20.654
That’s what I think Christ had realised,

00:42:21.112 --> 00:42:24.112
that Agnya should break. Unless and until Agnya breaks,

00:42:24.279 --> 00:42:28.696
people cannot go further. And that’s why He crucified Himself

00:42:29.112 --> 00:42:32.696
and then resurrected because without killing the Agnya,

00:42:33.154 --> 00:42:34.571
you cannot resurrect.

00:42:35.446 --> 00:42:39.321
All these things have worked out so well now

00:42:39.738 --> 00:42:44.488
that the whole world is seeing you like a panoramic view,

00:42:45.196 --> 00:42:49.237
of complete destruction of the nonsense.

00:42:50.696 --> 00:42:52.696
They are seeing this very clearly

00:42:53.112 --> 00:42:56.154
and you see now these people who would not even look at us,

00:42:57.279 --> 00:43:02.654
who had a very stiff nose and stiff lips and stiff neck

00:43:03.362 --> 00:43:08.112
— all is relaxed. They are wondering why this is happening.

00:43:08.654 --> 00:43:10.654
‘From when did we get this curse?’

00:43:11.488 --> 00:43:13.488
So for the Europeans specially,

00:43:14.362 --> 00:43:17.446
they have to understand the beauty

00:43:18.071 --> 00:43:21.488
and the love and the greatness of other human beings

00:43:22.321 --> 00:43:26.279
and then that will so much satisfy them.

00:43:27.112 --> 00:43:31.780
Why there is so much problem now of this recession, how it has come.

00:43:32.529 --> 00:43:36.237
Recession is nothing. It is the same Mr. Ego.

00:43:36.654 --> 00:43:42.654
It is the same conditioning, which was like a snake was eating up.

00:43:43.362 --> 00:43:45.404
Now it has receded. It is full.

00:43:46.362 --> 00:43:48.404
It doesn’t need any more. It’s quite full.

00:43:48.738 --> 00:43:54.529
And maybe it is now in danger of getting indigestion, I think.

00:43:55.196 --> 00:43:59.362
So that these two snakes that were eating human beings are receding.

00:44:00.738 --> 00:44:04.154
It’s the best time where you can see the drama.

00:44:04.696 --> 00:44:08.654
Drama of ego and your conditioning.

00:44:09.237 --> 00:44:12.613
How these two things have eaten up human beings.

00:44:13.321 --> 00:44:15.321
One should feel shy.

00:44:15.654 --> 00:44:19.613
One should feel a little bit modest about it.

00:44:20.446 --> 00:44:24.529
When you are full of ego, you don’t even see anything.

00:44:25.404 --> 00:44:30.488
Or putting a conditioning on others, it’s horrible, I tell you.

00:44:31.112 --> 00:44:34.446
I can’t understand how can they put a conditioning on others.

00:44:36.488 --> 00:44:41.488
It is now, you people all enjoy, say, for Indian music.

00:44:42.279 --> 00:44:44.112
But when the British were ruling us,

00:44:44.321 --> 00:44:47.321
they used to think it's a horrible noise going on.

00:44:48.696 --> 00:44:50.654
They could never understand.

00:44:51.154 --> 00:44:55.154
Now they are paying such a lot to attend the program for music.

00:44:55.780 --> 00:44:58.780
That is also a kind of a rebuff, but

00:44:59.321 --> 00:45:02.488
also they don’t understand. Still they will go

00:45:03.071 --> 00:45:07.112
because it’s regarded as a very big fashion

00:45:07.738 --> 00:45:09.529
to listen to Indian music.

00:45:10.112 --> 00:45:14.321
So it is your ego also is so stupid

00:45:14.529 --> 00:45:16.571
that God knows when it will give in.

00:45:17.196 --> 00:45:19.529
Today it will say, ‘This is the best thing.’

00:45:19.696 --> 00:45:21.488
Tomorrow it will say, 'No, no, no, no.

00:45:21.613 --> 00:45:23.696
We should take the other one. That’s much better.’

00:45:24.362 --> 00:45:27.362
Indecisive, they have no discrimination.

00:45:27.654 --> 00:45:30.654
Basically, people have no discrimination.

00:45:31.362 --> 00:45:34.321
Those who have ego are indiscriminate.

00:45:34.780 --> 00:45:38.654
They cannot discriminate between evil and good.

00:45:39.112 --> 00:45:42.071
And such people have been now,

00:45:42.529 --> 00:45:45.488
thank God, have been punished quite a lot.

00:45:45.696 --> 00:45:49.613
But it is the life of Christ, His model,

00:45:50.154 --> 00:45:56.529
proves that your resurrection is so essential,

00:45:56.780 --> 00:46:02.571
which is so innate, that unless and until you get it, you are lost.

00:46:03.321 --> 00:46:06.571
Whether it’s a country, whether it’s a person

00:46:07.071 --> 00:46:10.780
or any organisation. This ego that you have

00:46:11.279 --> 00:46:14.154
can ruin, ultimately, is now been proved,

00:46:15.237 --> 00:46:18.321
can completely take you away from reality.

00:46:19.279 --> 00:46:21.321
That is the thing that blinds you,

00:46:22.237 --> 00:46:24.488
which can — another ego can blind you also.

00:46:25.196 --> 00:46:27.696
Like we have those priests, we have those mullahs

00:46:28.112 --> 00:46:31.446
and all these people. They are the ones who have this

00:46:33.196 --> 00:46:37.196
tremendous power to misguide

00:46:37.696 --> 00:46:41.696
you because your ego has no discretion sense.

00:46:42.279 --> 00:46:44.321
It doesn’t even think like that.

00:46:45.279 --> 00:46:47.321
And when they are specially,

00:46:47.571 --> 00:46:50.571
not so much on the ego side, but on the conditioning side,

00:46:51.112 --> 00:46:53.696
it’s even much worse – much worse.

00:46:54.613 --> 00:46:57.321
Because when you are conditioned,

00:46:57.529 --> 00:47:00.279
you start believing into all kinds of nonsense.

00:47:00.613 --> 00:47:03.237
And you start ruining your health with that.

00:47:03.571 --> 00:47:08.696
It is a very, very surprising thing how people understand

00:47:09.321 --> 00:47:12.362
and like things which are very destructive.

00:47:13.780 --> 00:47:15.362
But you can manage.

00:47:15.529 --> 00:47:18.571
These are the modern times, where you can advertise,

00:47:19.112 --> 00:47:21.738
you can do all kinds of enticement, everything

00:47:22.237 --> 00:47:25.237
and you can manage this Mr. Ego very well,

00:47:25.654 --> 00:47:28.696
which pampers you. In this pampering,

00:47:29.154 --> 00:47:33.154
ego gets completely drowned and

00:47:33.404 --> 00:47:36.446
it loses its control over its own personality.

00:47:37.196 --> 00:47:39.362
Thus, many by people get lost into it.

00:47:40.529 --> 00:47:42.780
Now Christ has sacrificed His life

00:47:43.446 --> 00:47:45.362
and then He resurrected.

00:47:45.738 --> 00:47:47.780
In the same way, all such people

00:47:48.237 --> 00:47:51.237
who have ruined their lives have to come up

00:47:52.321 --> 00:47:56.196
through resurrection. there’s no other way out through Sahaja Yoga.

00:47:56.571 --> 00:48:01.362
When you understand your own value, you’ll understand everything.

00:48:02.404 --> 00:48:05.154
Otherwise, what is it? You are looking through your eyes

00:48:05.321 --> 00:48:07.196
or somebody else’s eyes?

00:48:07.404 --> 00:48:10.404
You are hearing through your ears or somebody else’s ear?

00:48:11.654 --> 00:48:15.279
It should be your own, so know thyself.

00:48:16.279 --> 00:48:19.738
When you know thyself, everything will work out very well.

00:48:20.696 --> 00:48:25.404
Out of this only, out of this category of people who know themselves

00:48:25.613 --> 00:48:27.654
Sahaja Yoga can be built up —

00:48:28.112 --> 00:48:30.654
not by people who do not know themselves.

00:48:32.112 --> 00:48:37.154
It’s a very, very long subject. I could go on on these two subjects,

00:48:37.362 --> 00:48:40.404
but the main thing is we have to be thankful

00:48:40.696 --> 00:48:46.154
to Christ for bringing this resurrection

00:48:46.404 --> 00:48:49.529
into play so that we get our discretion.

00:48:50.404 --> 00:48:52.404
Divine discretion, we’ll get it.

00:48:52.613 --> 00:48:57.654
It’s such a struggle, such a path He created,

00:48:58.154 --> 00:49:03.613
that we could go through this ordeal very easily,

00:49:04.529 --> 00:49:08.488
which will kill our ego and our conditionings.

00:49:10.279 --> 00:49:13.112
I am happy Sahaja Yogis will realise it

00:49:13.488 --> 00:49:16.196
and respect it within yourself,

00:49:16.404 --> 00:49:20.362
that you are seeing your ego and superego

00:49:20.654 --> 00:49:23.654
so clearly and that you could be above it.

00:49:25.196 --> 00:49:27.237
May God bless you all.
