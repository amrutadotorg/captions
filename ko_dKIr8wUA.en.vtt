00:19.200 --> 00:29.241
This falls on the day of famous great full moon,

00:29.241 --> 00:37.408
it is called as Sharada Indu, that's the name of the Goddess also

00:37.450 --> 00:43.867
Sharada Indu; the moon on this autumn season.

00:44.575 --> 00:51.199
This is the biggest moon, and - of course not in England,

00:52.075 --> 00:59.491
but in India - that day the moon is giving the greatest light,

01:00.199 --> 01:08.241
and it's such a great thing that Guru Nanaka was born on such a day.

01:09.200 --> 01:16.199
As you know in India people celebrate birthdays

01:16.200 --> 01:20.575
according to dates of the moon, called as tithi

01:21.199 --> 01:31.575
not as the dates we have here according to the sun.

01:54.241 --> 02:00.617
This great personality was born in Punjab

02:01.408 --> 02:08.992
where people were unaware of God's ways.

02:14.950 --> 02:26.950
He was always bothered about the Dharma in all his lives,

02:28.034 --> 02:31.200
because as you know he was the Primal Master,

02:31.867 --> 02:39.491
and the Primal Master is always placed

02:40.199 --> 02:42.992
in looking after our Void,

02:43.742 --> 02:49.867
in sustaining us, and giving us a model of an ideal master.

02:50.658 --> 03:00.366
And he always took birth either in the most difficult places

03:00.408 --> 03:04.867
like hills and dales and mountains, or they took places --

03:06.034 --> 03:12.450
which are even more difficult thing, among the people who were horrid,

03:13.200 --> 03:16.200
and who needed their help.

03:16.867 --> 03:24.199
So in India, that time somehow Punjab was regarded as the place

03:24.200 --> 03:36.992
where people did not respect God or traditional Hindu idols,

03:37.658 --> 03:48.909
or you can say the statues that were regarded as the vibrating ones.

03:49.533 --> 03:55.200
But they worshipped money (even now)

03:55.742 --> 04:00.825
and they worshipped power.

04:01.325 --> 04:12.366
And as at that time there was a King who was very anxious

04:12.408 --> 04:15.950
to convert people to Islamic Religion by giving them money,

04:17.491 --> 04:20.783
many were taking to Islam.

04:21.450 --> 04:26.575
As a result the Hindus started hating the muslims

04:27.199 --> 04:32.241
and a big hatred developed among Muslims and Hindus.

04:35.617 --> 04:41.075
That's how, in those circumstances where there was a quarrel going on

04:41.075 --> 04:45.742
between the followers of Mohammad and followers of Hinduism,

04:46.241 --> 04:50.533
Mohammad himself took his birth on this earth,

04:50.533 --> 04:55.950
though he had decided not to take any more births,

04:55.992 --> 04:58.200
he thought that it would solve the problem.

04:58.867 --> 05:02.533
Although, this incarnation is such that it never dies.

05:03.199 --> 05:16.658
Even if they leave the body, they are always around.

05:16.658 --> 05:21.241
And they are the ones who perform lots of miracles

05:21.783 --> 05:25.325
when any other incarnation comes on this earth.

05:26.658 --> 05:30.241
They help support and guide the seekers

05:30.241 --> 05:32.117
to go to the incarnations.

05:32.742 --> 05:35.617
So, to celebrate his birthday

05:37.742 --> 05:44.325
on such a date is also a myth,

05:44.366 --> 05:48.199
because he never died. He is eternally living.

05:48.742 --> 05:53.325
They never grow and they never die.

05:53.909 --> 05:57.366
But his birth is important,

05:57.950 --> 06:02.909
because symbolically he came on this earth

06:02.909 --> 06:10.075
not to propogate any particular type of the void --

06:10.117 --> 06:16.825
as Mohammad did or say Moses did, and before that Abraham,

06:16.825 --> 06:28.617
Lao Tse, or Socrates - which followed into a religion.

06:29.283 --> 06:35.909
But he came to create amity - we can say, to create understanding,

06:36.241 --> 06:39.199
to create unity between religions.

06:39.742 --> 06:42.783
This was a very big step for Sahaja Yoga.

06:43.199 --> 06:49.034
After that as you know, he was born again - God knows where --

06:49.700 --> 06:53.700
no one knows where he was born, but he appeared as Shirdi Sai Nath.

06:54.159 --> 07:00.909
He too said the same thing, that to talk ill of any religion is a sin.

07:01.450 --> 07:14.159
But these efforts are quite lost.

07:14.742 --> 07:19.658
Because the people who were Islamic at that time,

07:20.159 --> 07:27.325
or those who were Hindus, are now very great fanatics.

07:27.992 --> 07:31.783
So instead of them coming closer and loving each other

07:32.283 --> 07:33.783
they have become fanatics.

07:42.491 --> 07:46.700
Though we find that Islam is spreading so fast

07:47.450 --> 07:50.658
Sikhism is spreading very fast too.

07:50.658 --> 07:56.159
In America there is a horrible guru he has started to spread Sikhism.

07:56.159 --> 08:00.199
He's converting all the white skinned people into Sikhs.

08:00.617 --> 08:05.783
They are growing their hair, and they are also growing their beard,

08:06.200 --> 08:10.200
and wearing a kara and all those five things

08:10.241 --> 08:13.159
that were required at the time of Guru Gobind Singh.

08:13.199 --> 08:17.075
When the war had started they had to wear all these things,

08:17.200 --> 08:18.742
which was important.

08:19.491 --> 08:26.575
Because war had started and to protect Hinduism or Hindus

08:27.199 --> 08:29.992
from the invasion of the Muslims --

08:30.408 --> 08:33.199
the fanaticism of the Muslims --

08:33.783 --> 08:38.783
they took to this kind of a military stuff.

08:39.325 --> 08:43.200
Actually if you believe in God - nothing can be killed.

08:43.742 --> 08:48.575
But I think that Guru Gobind thought that he had to take it.

08:49.075 --> 08:52.909
In all these prophetic religions, if you see, all the prophets

08:52.909 --> 08:56.742
who have spread all the religions, they were always attacked so badly

08:57.034 --> 08:59.034
that they had to take to weapons.

08:59.200 --> 09:02.408
Even in Islam they had to take to weapons to protect themselves.

09:04.325 --> 09:05.617
Now when these people took to weapons

09:05.658 --> 09:09.283
they had some discipline put on the people.

09:10.117 --> 09:14.992
Without the discipline nothing is possible.

09:15.700 --> 09:19.366
And very strict discipline was there for the Sikhs.

09:19.366 --> 09:22.241
Now today's Sikhs are no more Sikhs,

09:22.241 --> 09:25.241
they are just outside, and inside they are not.

09:31.825 --> 09:36.950
I would not describe all the strictness and discipline

09:36.950 --> 09:46.408
they had to go through. But every disciple has to go

09:46.450 --> 09:50.742
through a very severe disciplining of himself

09:51.366 --> 09:56.117
if he has to become the Guru. There is no doubt about it.

09:58.034 --> 10:02.992
It is not that only somebody like Me comes and tells you

10:03.034 --> 10:05.909
do this do that, and next day you forget these things.

10:05.909 --> 10:10.283
It is very serious matter, one has to understand.

10:12.200 --> 10:14.533
You have got your realization through Sahaja Yoga

10:14.533 --> 10:17.450
Now you have become Sahaja Yogis.

10:17.992 --> 10:22.159
But still I would say you are not full Sahaja Yogis

10:22.199 --> 10:24.867
because every Sahaja Yogi has to be a Guru

10:25.491 --> 10:27.241
Otherwise he is not a Sahaja Yogi.

10:27.283 --> 10:33.867
First of all you are Yogis because you got your realisation.

10:34.992 --> 10:38.491
But Yogis are of no use, you have to be Sahaja Yogis.

10:38.533 --> 10:41.200
So you were told about all the chakras,

10:41.241 --> 10:49.366
every thing that you are doing, about all the problems of Kundalini

10:49.366 --> 10:52.658
how to cure them. Everything about it was told to you.

10:52.658 --> 11:01.075
Now you became, with that, a different type of a race,

11:01.117 --> 11:04.909
a different type of people, who are twice-born,

11:05.992 --> 11:10.241
who are born by the Spirit, not by the flesh.

11:10.742 --> 11:14.034
Remember that that's a very important point and which John has said.

11:14.075 --> 11:18.700
That you are born by the Spirit not by the flesh.

11:18.700 --> 11:21.742
Those who are born by the flesh are in flesh.

11:21.742 --> 11:26.617
But if you are born by the Spirit, that's how you are twice born.

11:26.658 --> 11:31.742
And when you know all about the Spirit and the Kundalini

11:31.783 --> 11:33.575
then you are a Sahaja Yogi.

11:33.617 --> 11:36.950
But unless and until you become Guru,

11:36.992 --> 11:40.909
you are not a full Sahaja Yogi.

11:40.950 --> 11:46.283
So to begin with, we must understand that the Spirit is described

11:46.325 --> 11:49.617
as a Kala, a a phase of Moon, one phase of moon.

11:51.575 --> 11:56.200
But a Guru is described as the full moon - purnima -Guru Purnima.

11:56.825 --> 12:00.575
Guru is the full moon, it's not just a phase.

12:01.159 --> 12:06.992
So from one phase you have to go to the stage

12:07.450 --> 12:10.408
where you become a complete Guru.

12:10.575 --> 12:14.117
16 phases there are altogether,

12:14.159 --> 12:21.241
and you have ro cross the 16 stages to become the Guru.

12:21.658 --> 12:23.450
Now how do we do it?

12:24.658 --> 12:28.159
We have to become extremely objective about it.

12:28.159 --> 12:29.992
How do we become the Guru?

12:30.034 --> 12:31.700
Because we have to become Gurus, no doubt.

12:31.700 --> 12:35.117
Now you cannot just say that, Mother you give us a tape

12:35.159 --> 12:38.491
and we'll learn by heart and we'll go on to another person

12:38.533 --> 12:40.366
saying blah blah blah blah blah.

12:40.408 --> 12:43.241
Same thing, whetever I've told you, or take my type

12:43.283 --> 12:46.159
and show them that this is our Mother,

12:46.199 --> 12:51.450
and She's like this and like that. But they will say alright

12:52.075 --> 12:54.658
She may be, but what about you. Sir ?

12:56.117 --> 13:01.658
Now Sahaja Yoga has a 'very' big responsibility,

13:01.700 --> 13:03.700
which I don't think people understand.

13:03.742 --> 13:08.742
I wish they could listen to me very intensely and understand it.

13:09.241 --> 13:14.450
So far if you see. Gurus remained Gurus

13:14.450 --> 13:16.533
and no disciples became Gurus.

13:19.199 --> 13:21.700
They were still regarded as disciples of a Guru,

13:21.742 --> 13:23.575
whether it was fake or anything.

13:25.075 --> 13:27.199
They never became Gurus themselves.

13:28.491 --> 13:31.825
So there was no need for them to grow,

13:31.867 --> 13:34.617
they had to take the name of their Guru alright.

13:35.200 --> 13:39.617
Christ and his disciples, Mohammad Sahib had his own disciples.

13:40.199 --> 13:45.783
Nanaka had his own disciples, Shirdi Sai Nath had his own disciples.

13:46.325 --> 13:48.700
None of them became Gurus.

13:49.199 --> 13:53.241
But now it is in your lot, sorry to say,

13:53.700 --> 13:56.491
that you have to become the Gurus.

13:57.199 --> 13:59.783
It's a privilege, actually.

14:00.200 --> 14:03.491
It's a very great privilege to become the Guru.

14:03.950 --> 14:09.241
And to become the Guru, we must learn what we have to do.

14:09.742 --> 14:14.408
This also sometimes becomes just a lecture. I think so.

14:14.992 --> 14:17.742
Because I've already told you on Guru Purnima

14:17.783 --> 14:20.199
what are the 10 attainments we have to have.

14:20.575 --> 14:25.825
Today all these 16 stages are to be seen,

14:25.825 --> 14:30.992
how we have to grow into a Guru.

14:31.617 --> 14:40.700
First is, we have complete discipline put on ourselves.

14:41.117 --> 14:44.825
Like Mr Nick is attacked by everyone.

14:46.408 --> 14:50.199
No, you attack yourself. You become Mr Nick now.

14:53.658 --> 14:58.783
You have to make this body subservient to you,

14:58.825 --> 15:00.742
that is the first mastery.

15:01.159 --> 15:04.742
The mastery is that my body can sleep anywhere,

15:05.199 --> 15:11.325
it can starve itself, it can live under any circumstances,

15:11.700 --> 15:13.783
it dare not grudge.

15:13.909 --> 15:18.700
Anywhere; it should be able to sleep any time,

15:18.742 --> 15:20.909
it should be able to keep awake anytime.

15:21.742 --> 15:23.825
This body is to be mastered.

15:24.825 --> 15:27.408
Even if you read 'Ashtanga Yoga'

15:27.450 --> 15:29.992
first thing is mastery over the body, they say.

15:30.034 --> 15:33.199
So after realisation the first thing you have to do

15:33.200 --> 15:34.658
is master this body,

15:34.700 --> 15:38.742
and is the most difficult thing for western people;

15:39.450 --> 15:41.533
because the matter is sitting on their Spirit.

15:43.658 --> 15:46.950
First the Spirit has to come - first phase --

15:47.533 --> 15:49.700
at least the Spirit has to be there.

15:50.909 --> 15:57.159
If you have to be the Spirit then thematter of moon

15:57.159 --> 15:59.575
has to be covered with that light.

16:00.408 --> 16:03.491
In the first phase we have to master our body.

16:04.034 --> 16:07.366
So what do we do to master our body ?

16:08.366 --> 16:12.034
First of all we must see that what are the things

16:12.450 --> 16:17.617
that drain out our bodily mastery.

16:18.199 --> 16:22.950
We must know all the crooks who try to master us.

16:23.366 --> 16:47.825
So I have to first face my body.

16:50.992 --> 16:55.742
That first and foremost thing in Sahaja Yoga we learn

16:56.241 --> 16:58.867
that we have to respect our body.

16:59.283 --> 17:04.034
This is the first principle of respecting our body.

17:04.533 --> 17:07.450
Means indulgence is sinful to the body,

17:07.909 --> 17:13.742
because indulgence gives you a body which is no good:

17:15.992 --> 17:18.742
First of all you must respect your body

17:18.783 --> 17:20.992
so that you can master it.

17:21.200 --> 17:23.325
If I do not respect you, I cannot master you.

17:23.742 --> 17:27.491
So to master the body first of all respect your body.

17:28.950 --> 17:33.491
And to respect your body, you must look after your body very well.

17:35.075 --> 17:36.700
But no indulgence.

17:37.199 --> 17:40.491
That doesn't mean that you go and stand in the mud

17:40.950 --> 17:44.950
or rain for hours together or get exposed,

17:45.658 --> 17:53.283
to make your body absolutely sort of a abode for all the diseases

17:53.325 --> 17:55.450
and colds and coughs and things like that

17:55.867 --> 18:00.533
so your Mother suffers cleaning your vishuddhi!

18:04.366 --> 18:07.283
It's like a horse whose neck is down.

18:09.742 --> 18:14.325
So you must look after your body by hot giving it diseases.

18:14.950 --> 18:17.575
Laziness is against it.

18:18.034 --> 18:19.909
Persons who are lazy must know

18:19.950 --> 18:22.617
that laziness is against your body.

18:22.617 --> 18:26.325
Lazy people who are not bothered to dress up properly,

18:26.783 --> 18:30.825
to cover themselves up properly, look after their body properly,

18:31.241 --> 18:38.491
put oil into different screws that they have, to massage themselves.

18:39.075 --> 18:41.658
Look after the body, that's the point.

18:42.075 --> 18:45.909
To look after the body you must give some time,

18:45.950 --> 18:48.491
because this body is the temple of God.

18:48.533 --> 18:50.950
And now you have become the temple

18:50.992 --> 18:52.617
but if the temple is dirty,

18:52.658 --> 19:01.117
is sick, is unimpressive, is like a stick, or like a balloon,

19:01.450 --> 19:04.450
nobody is going to come near it.

19:06.533 --> 19:09.366
So try to improve your personality,

19:10.867 --> 19:13.825
that it has to be a beautiful temple.

19:16.325 --> 19:20.783
I mean, I have given you so many tips, that I think

19:20.783 --> 19:24.617
that in my lives' time I have not given so many tips, even as Guru.

19:25.658 --> 19:28.783
Because normally people who came to a Guru in those days

19:28.825 --> 19:31.366
were really, really great seekers.

19:31.491 --> 19:34.700
They would hang themselves upside down, just to please the Guru,

19:35.283 --> 19:37.075
for months together.

19:40.408 --> 19:44.366
So that was a very different quality people -- but one or two.

19:45.117 --> 19:48.533
And when you have quantity quality goes down, I accept.

19:48.825 --> 19:52.199
But why not you people take it upon yourselves

19:52.200 --> 19:54.700
that we'll make our quality first class ?

19:54.742 --> 19:56.950
So first of all train up your body well.

19:59.533 --> 20:02.533
You must take some exercises in the morning, I have told you.

20:03.533 --> 20:06.159
That people sleep after breakfast I am told,

20:06.199 --> 20:10.491
I was amazed. I mean, this is too much.

20:10.992 --> 20:15.867
You see, God has given you this house as a blessing,

20:18.075 --> 20:24.325
to be more alert, to give His light to others.

20:24.366 --> 20:32.283
Instead of that if the candle is not even flickering what's the use.

20:34.575 --> 20:40.283
So what you have to do is to first of all brush up, yourself, completely.

20:41.117 --> 20:43.700
Make your body alright, alert.

20:44.408 --> 20:47.283
Actually at your age one should not sleep

20:47.283 --> 20:51.159
for more than six or seven hours, I tell you. No need.

20:52.950 --> 20:55.283
Six or seven hours of deep sleep is sufficient.

20:57.075 --> 21:00.950
I also, in the night I sleep about --

21:00.950 --> 21:03.491
never before eleven sometimes at twelve,

21:03.533 --> 21:07.450
Yesterday we slept at 20'clock, got up at 5. 30 as usual.

21:07.491 --> 21:10.533
So how many ? Three and a half hours sleep.

21:10.533 --> 21:14.325
And just now I slept for about at the most for half an hour

21:14.325 --> 21:16.034
or an hour or so finished.

21:16.825 --> 21:21.450
When you don't have to work, like me,

21:22.075 --> 21:24.325
in the sense that even when I sleep I am working.

21:27.117 --> 21:30.241
So to rest your body for such a long time

21:30.241 --> 21:32.366
you make your body sit on your head

21:32.867 --> 21:37.200
and it will be very very difficult for you to be alert.

21:38.950 --> 21:42.200
So first of all body must be looked after.

21:42.825 --> 21:44.909
There should be no self-indulgence.

21:45.366 --> 21:48.200
I mean it can go to any extent of self indulgence.

21:48.241 --> 21:51.366
Like people don't keep their rooms clean, their clothes clean,

21:51.408 --> 21:55.575
they have no activities - all these nonsensical things,

21:55.617 --> 21:58.867
only it is too low, too base to talk about; but it happens.

21:59.366 --> 22:02.200
People can go to any base limit - you know,

22:02.241 --> 22:03.950
that's the problem, what to do?

22:05.950 --> 22:10.159
On this full moon day one has to realize

22:10.199 --> 22:13.700
that on a full moon day you are over-active.

22:13.909 --> 22:16.617
As the moon starts growing the activity starts.

22:16.658 --> 22:18.199
In the night also.

22:19.783 --> 22:22.491
But none of you so far

22:22.533 --> 22:24.366
are active in the night except for me.

22:25.199 --> 22:28.199
But if you come up you will be surprised,

22:28.200 --> 22:30.575
even in your sleep you will be active.

22:33.867 --> 22:38.825
So first and foremost thing is that you must look after your body.

22:38.825 --> 22:40.533
The body should be presentable.

22:41.825 --> 22:48.992
And should not go with the so-called fashions of the day.

22:49.034 --> 22:50.533
It is very important.

22:50.992 --> 22:53.950
One should not go with the fashions of the day,

22:55.450 --> 22:58.283
and take to something which is nonsensical,

22:58.867 --> 23:02.909
which is not good for your appearance,

23:03.283 --> 23:07.199
which makes you look funny or very fashionable

23:07.200 --> 23:08.992
like a dandy person.

23:09.408 --> 23:14.783
We have to wear a dress which is in the centre, dignified, which is good.

23:20.783 --> 23:25.867
Now I'm told that it is very difficult even to wake up in England.

23:26.533 --> 23:28.950
Somebody had told me, when I was young,

23:29.325 --> 23:31.658
that don't wake up an Englishman.

23:33.742 --> 23:37.491
I haven't tried that, even with a barge pole.

23:38.241 --> 23:41.742
I just tell you at this time, never in the morning time.

23:42.159 --> 23:44.992
Because I've been warned: never wake up an Englishman,

23:44.992 --> 23:47.283
that is the greatest sin on this earth!

23:53.825 --> 23:57.533
So why should the English be so much addicted to sleep!

23:58.200 --> 24:01.075
The whole country is sleeping today.

24:01.617 --> 24:05.491
They want more wages, more wages so that they can sleep more.

24:07.325 --> 24:11.241
Eat and drink, drink and eat in between, sleep.

24:11.283 --> 24:16.658
This is the three - programmed life.

24:19.533 --> 24:23.283
It was very difficult, from the very beginnig

24:23.325 --> 24:28.491
I saw Sahaja Yogis coming, in that to wake them up was difficult.

24:28.533 --> 24:34.283
And these are the same people who were known for punctuality

24:34.325 --> 24:38.992
that they won the war at Waterloo because of punctuality,

24:39.742 --> 24:45.159
and they were so punctual that people used to set their watches --

24:45.199 --> 24:47.992
even in America. They are the same people.

24:48.533 --> 24:52.992
Now the other side of it is that they sleep like log of wood.

24:53.450 --> 24:56.159
They used to sleep before also must be, because this is an old saying that.

24:56.199 --> 24:57.950
Don't wake up an Englishman.

24:58.742 --> 25:02.992
But I used to think something else about it why it is said,

25:02.992 --> 25:05.742
but it is nothing but simple laziness.

25:07.200 --> 25:14.117
So try to see why we sleep so much.

25:18.034 --> 25:22.159
If the left side is strong, people sleep.

25:23.075 --> 25:27.366
If the back Agnya is strong, people sleep.

25:27.533 --> 25:33.867
If the front Agnya is working too much

25:34.408 --> 25:36.783
then people don't sleep.

25:39.408 --> 25:42.408
So even if I say, "Don't sleep",

25:42.742 --> 25:48.034
it mean that you put your right Agnya in working condition,

25:48.034 --> 25:50.034
that means you start thinking.

25:50.075 --> 25:51.825
Which is against Sahaja Yoga again.

25:53.075 --> 25:56.034
So it would be left agnya, right agnya, right agnya, left agnya,

25:56.034 --> 25:57.325
left agnya, left agnya, right agnya, left agnya...

25:57.325 --> 25:59.575
It will be going from one to another.

26:01.658 --> 26:10.533
So in the centre you have to be with Christ.

26:14.199 --> 26:19.199
He is alert every second of the day;

26:24.992 --> 26:28.283
killing; beating, hitting,

26:29.533 --> 26:35.867
curing, looking after, guiding.

26:36.658 --> 26:45.742
Twenty four hours a day. And go and ask any realized soul

26:45.783 --> 26:48.450
who is called as Avadhuta, the one who is a master,

26:48.491 --> 26:52.783
they will tell you they hardly sleep for three hours or four hours.

26:53.450 --> 26:56.950
Because they cannot work when they are sleeping,

26:57.199 --> 26:58.700
so they sleep for four hours,

26:58.742 --> 27:00.617
the rest of the time they are working:

27:01.325 --> 27:05.617
either they meditate and do things by projection,

27:06.159 --> 27:09.450
or they work with their hands.

27:10.034 --> 27:12.783
They are busy people, they are very busy.

27:13.283 --> 27:20.700
You have to be very busy people because now you are employed by God.

27:21.199 --> 27:26.575
And you have to do full justice to this employment by working hard.

27:27.199 --> 27:33.450
On the contrary you have seen that it is very easy to get lazy.

27:39.241 --> 27:44.034
So now, as many of you are already feeling sleepy, put your....

27:44.867 --> 27:48.199
First thing should be for all those people who are lazy,

27:48.199 --> 27:50.992
is to put their right to the left seven times -

27:51.075 --> 27:52.366
let's have it.

27:55.159 --> 27:57.575
With the right hand....

28:12.992 --> 28:18.199
It's better? Now the back Agnya.

28:18.199 --> 28:20.075
Let's have it.

28:22.992 --> 28:29.950
Laziness is first. Shri Krishna was against laziness.

28:29.950 --> 28:35.034
Anywhere he got a chance he talked against laziness, Alasya.

28:36.992 --> 28:38.909
Now watch me.

28:39.825 --> 28:41.950
On the photograph you can do the same....

29:39.950 --> 29:41.617
Better now?

29:45.491 --> 29:49.199
Tonight we have to keep awake; it's a big problem.

29:50.909 --> 29:53.825
But don't sleep formally here. Alright ?

29:53.950 --> 29:55.867
Informally you can.

30:09.950 --> 30:11.867
Better ?

30:14.075 --> 30:17.658
Put your eyes, try Again.

30:49.909 --> 30:54.034
So the mastery should be, first of all, of your body.

30:55.867 --> 30:58.742
Say, you are sleeping on one side, you get a pain --

30:58.742 --> 31:00.950
then what do you do? You sleep on the other side.

31:02.742 --> 31:06.825
In the same way, this body is to be made

31:06.825 --> 31:10.533
immune to different shocks,

31:10.575 --> 31:13.867
you see. Like you put the watch in the water.

31:14.325 --> 31:17.658
You shock it with the water, so it is waterproof.

31:18.117 --> 31:21.366
So a Sahaja Yogi has to be an all-proofed person.

31:23.034 --> 31:31.950
So he has no place to complain,

31:32.658 --> 31:35.075
because he's supposed to be all-proof, you see.

31:35.117 --> 31:38.159
Anybody (Sahaja Yogi) who complains, you can say,

31:38.199 --> 31:39.992
"How are you complaining?

31:39.992 --> 31:41.575
Because you have to be all-proof."

31:43.366 --> 31:53.159
So no complaints of any kind, of Sahaja Yogis

31:53.199 --> 31:55.575
are to be accepted or sympathized.

32:01.241 --> 32:06.491
If you start accepting people who are complaining type

32:07.075 --> 32:09.408
you will be always busy looking after them,

32:09.909 --> 32:13.450
and you will be of no use to Sahaja Yoga.

32:15.199 --> 32:18.992
Those who have habits of complaininig and all that

32:19.034 --> 32:21.117
should go to the hospital and stay there.

32:21.742 --> 32:25.408
Complaining people are really people

32:25.450 --> 32:28.283
who have some sort of possession,

32:28.325 --> 32:32.366
I think, that they all the time complain and try to torture you,

32:32.909 --> 32:35.199
and make a nuisance out of themselves.

32:35.909 --> 32:38.199
Such people cannot become Gurus.

32:38.199 --> 32:43.034
Imagine - if the Guru is complaining then what is he going to teach?

32:43.075 --> 32:44.867
Only complaining.

32:45.617 --> 32:48.700
The teachers will be expert in complaining

32:48.700 --> 32:50.950
and the students will be also experts in complaining.

32:51.283 --> 32:56.117
So you create a set of complaining disciples, you see,

32:57.408 --> 32:59.533
And when they come to Me what I find

32:59.575 --> 33:03.325
they all have double lists than yourselves about their complaints.

33:05.200 --> 33:07.617
But also it is very characteristic.

33:07.658 --> 33:09.867
Like Australians seldom complain,

33:10.491 --> 33:13.159
and if they do complain they are hit also very badly.

33:13.700 --> 33:16.783
Seldom you will find an Australian complaining.

33:16.783 --> 33:18.950
I have got letters - except one or two

33:19.366 --> 33:22.283
who have now found themselves out - seldom

33:22.950 --> 33:27.283
they complain about themselves, about their body comforts,

33:27.283 --> 33:30.450
this thing that thing. So under any circumstances

33:30.992 --> 33:35.783
those who can live are the people

33:36.200 --> 33:38.742
who have achieved the one sixteenth,

33:39.199 --> 33:40.783
only the one sixteenth.

33:41.034 --> 33:43.742
(Jaise rakhahu taise hi rahu)

33:43.742 --> 33:47.450
Mother the way you keep it we are willing to stay.

33:47.992 --> 33:50.992
Of course the Mother has kept you very well.

33:54.491 --> 33:57.241
All the luxuries of world Mother has given you.

33:58.825 --> 34:01.575
She doesn't torture you like other Gurus have tortured.

34:02.075 --> 34:03.825
Once and for all.

34:04.199 --> 34:07.034
My Son has gone through all the tortures,

34:08.241 --> 34:13.200
there is no need to put you to any tortures or troubles.

34:13.408 --> 34:15.658
But you should see how your body reacts,

34:15.700 --> 34:20.700
and tell your body, "Yes Mr body, will you please now,

34:20.700 --> 34:23.825
behave yourself and not try to be indulgent."

34:25.700 --> 34:32.117
All these indulgences come to us through our senses.

34:32.617 --> 34:35.909
So if you can master your body

34:35.909 --> 34:38.408
you will also master your senses.

34:38.950 --> 34:49.658
For example the master, or we say the highest of the organs

34:49.700 --> 34:53.241
which controls most of the organs, I personally think, is the tongue.

34:53.909 --> 34:58.408
Because it's the primordial nonsense.

35:01.658 --> 35:08.034
By tongue we speak things to hurt others.

35:08.658 --> 35:13.408
With tongue we learn how to go on jabbering.

35:13.992 --> 35:17.867
With tongue we can show how frivolous we are.

35:18.575 --> 35:21.783
Either we are tongue tied or tongue - loose,

35:22.075 --> 35:24.700
there's nothing in between with the tongue.

35:24.700 --> 35:27.117
That's only about talking part, that's lower.

35:27.533 --> 35:31.159
But when it comes higher, eating;

35:33.159 --> 35:35.199
all the time thinking about eating.

35:35.199 --> 35:38.783
I have told you a hundred times, that Sahaja Yogis should go

35:38.783 --> 35:44.283
on really sometimes on absolutely bland boiled horrible food --

35:45.700 --> 35:52.700
just to test the tongue. Do it, try this, then try this.

35:52.950 --> 35:56.867
My father used to tell that you must burn your tongue a little bit.

35:57.366 --> 35:59.909
That's one of the tests he said one should do.

35:59.909 --> 36:02.117
But he was a hard taskmaster as a Guru.

36:02.700 --> 36:05.783
So we should see what our tongue can bear,

36:06.366 --> 36:09.199
is it fussy about food ?

36:14.117 --> 36:19.283
When it sees the food does it start watering, first of all;

36:23.575 --> 36:26.491
does it take our attention to food,

36:27.075 --> 36:28.992
is food important to us?

36:29.491 --> 36:42.034
So the first thing, to overcome the problem of your tongue is

36:42.034 --> 36:46.783
"to starve." Starvation is the only way

36:46.825 --> 36:50.325
you can correct yourself. You see if you starve yourself --

36:50.408 --> 36:56.909
say, morning just have little to eat, reduce it to half.

36:56.950 --> 36:59.783
You'll be surprised your intestine will be halved also.

36:59.783 --> 37:02.700
After some time you cannot eat more even if you want to.

37:03.408 --> 37:07.700
Your interest will go off. Train up yourself.

37:07.742 --> 37:09.742
Starvation is a very good thing.

37:09.742 --> 37:13.241
I think 40 days that Christ did is a very good idea.

37:15.783 --> 37:20.783
But that should not be a kind of a thing that like - they have Ramazan,

37:21.159 --> 37:26.867
that they eat the most s..... food during that time early in the morning

37:26.867 --> 37:29.283
then the whole day they starve - thinking about food!

37:32.491 --> 37:38.575
Starve yourself fully and don't think about food.

37:38.575 --> 37:40.825
That's difficult so starve yourself  in halfway

37:41.199 --> 37:42.700
and dont think about food.

37:44.159 --> 37:46.909
Gradually try to master your tongue.

37:47.658 --> 37:51.241
Mastery of your tongue is only possible if you know

37:51.283 --> 37:54.450
how to starve your day. This is for the western side.

37:54.533 --> 37:58.491
For eastern side they fast morning till evening.

37:59.742 --> 38:02.117
I know one lady, if you ask them they say

38:02.159 --> 38:06.200
"I observe Monday, I observe Tuesday, I observe Wednesday,

38:06.241 --> 38:09.825
I observe Thursday, I observe Friday a fast,

38:09.867 --> 38:16.075
and perhaps maybe if I do not starve Saturday I will eat on Sunday."

38:16.909 --> 38:20.200
I have know such people in my life time - many --

38:20.742 --> 38:22.909
who just go on fasting.

38:22.909 --> 38:25.034
They are such experts and astute? you see,

38:25.658 --> 38:29.575
that they can show you that they can fast for 50 days, 80 days,

38:29.575 --> 38:33.617
108 days, and 300 days.

38:34.117 --> 38:36.200
Starving masters.

38:36.700 --> 38:40.450
So for them I have to tell, "you have to eat'', when they are starve.

38:40.491 --> 38:42.075
To you I have to say,

38:42.075 --> 38:45.742
"Let us see which day we can starve ourselves."

38:45.742 --> 38:52.199
Let us have one day to celebrate today's great day of Nanaka!

38:52.199 --> 38:55.867
One day let us starve. Which day should we?

38:58.117 --> 39:02.950
Monday we cannot because Monday we have a programme,

39:04.533 --> 39:10.117
Tuesday we cannot because it is a day when Hanuman has to work,

39:13.783 --> 39:16.825
Wednesday we cannot, because then the creativity takes place,

39:18.408 --> 39:21.700
Thursday we cannot because we are Guru at that day,

39:21.742 --> 39:24.950
we have to work very hard as Gurus, Friday we cannot,

39:24.992 --> 39:27.117
we have to work the shakti of Mother,

39:27.117 --> 39:29.617
Saturday we cannot because we have to do

39:29.617 --> 39:33.491
all the intrigue of Shri Krishna.

39:34.199 --> 39:37.408
And Sunday how can it be, this is the day of the sun!"

39:40.117 --> 39:44.199
So which is the best day for starving, now let us see.

39:45.366 --> 39:51.658
We should have Thursday, because Thursday is the Guru's day

39:51.992 --> 39:56.658
and let us do some fasting, half day, half day can we?

39:56.700 --> 39:59.909
Can we start with half day then f... day?

39:59.909 --> 40:02.909
Thursday let us have, maybe second half

40:02.909 --> 40:05.283
because breakfast is essential I think.

40:06.366 --> 40:09.617
Without breakfast you see, the horses cannot whinny,

40:12.283 --> 40:14.366
so let us have the second half

40:17.742 --> 40:20.117
or we can have the first half.

40:20.867 --> 40:26.491
Actually you have to discipline yourself, if you have to be the Gurus.

40:26.533 --> 40:29.283
It's like going to a college,

40:29.491 --> 40:31.325
when you are left to yourself,

40:31.366 --> 40:34.241
it is you, who has to discipline yourself,

40:34.283 --> 40:37.199
nobody has to tell you that you do this and do that

40:37.199 --> 40:39.408
That's the measure to wake you up.

40:39.450 --> 40:42.491
In India it is the other way around.

40:42.491 --> 40:45.825
If you tell somebody that you have to wake up at 5,

40:46.617 --> 40:51.867
the person who has told you will be awakened at 4 o' clock himself,

40:51.909 --> 40:56.200
the one who has told; so that he doesn't get up to wake him up.

40:56.950 --> 40:58.700
Did you follow me?

40:59.241 --> 41:01.950
And the whole house will be awakened at 4 o'clock

41:02.366 --> 41:05.325
so that they can take up the duty from the person

41:05.325 --> 41:06.825
who has to get awakened.

41:09.159 --> 41:10.950
But the fellow who has to awaken

41:10.992 --> 41:12.658
might not sleep the whole night.

41:13.617 --> 41:17.075
It is just the other way round, the other extreme of it.

41:17.491 --> 41:23.825
Say if I am there, one night I sleep there. If I get up

41:24.366 --> 41:27.575
at one o'clock I find all of them sitting and meditating,

41:27.575 --> 41:30.199
in the passage, up to the bathroom everywhere.

41:30.200 --> 41:33.241
They have not gone home, not taken food, nothing.

41:33.742 --> 41:36.283
Just meditating, taking vibrations, correcting.

41:36.283 --> 41:37.950
I am sleeping inside.

41:37.950 --> 41:40.199
In the night I want to go to the bathroom,

41:40.199 --> 41:42.325
I just cannot go because they are all meditating.

41:42.366 --> 41:44.533
Nobody is sleeping, nobody is sleeping.

41:50.950 --> 41:53.241
So it is the other way around.

41:54.199 --> 41:56.867
So to you people let us do one day.

41:56.867 --> 42:02.199
That you must have one day fasting, one day keeping, one awake.

42:02.742 --> 42:05.283
Which day should it be? Let's see.

42:08.283 --> 42:10.867
A day when there is no film!

42:18.658 --> 42:25.909
Half night, second half I mean, not the first half.

42:29.783 --> 42:41.200
Which day? Which is the most difficult day when you cannot,

42:43.199 --> 42:51.034
cannot keep awake. Sunday night;

42:52.034 --> 42:54.658
but there's a fiIm on!

42:57.366 --> 43:00.700
Without the film, you see!

43:00.700 --> 43:03.783
Treat yourself like that, joke with yourself,

43:03.783 --> 43:06.617
now Sunday night is there a film on?

43:06.658 --> 43:08.283
After 12 there isn't.

43:08.325 --> 43:10.658
So Sunday night you get up at 12 o'clock.

43:10.700 --> 43:17.992
Let's have it. Enjoy it. Don't get angry.

43:20.034 --> 43:22.159
Make a fun out of it.

43:25.034 --> 43:29.199
You think more about it, then you get upset.

43:29.200 --> 43:31.241
You just don't think about it, then you'll enjoy it.

43:31.241 --> 43:32.783
It's like swimming.

43:32.825 --> 43:37.325
Get up at 12 o'clock, all of you, go for a bath, sit down,

43:37.366 --> 43:41.034
sing Bhajans, this, that, let us do it. Should we ?

43:45.783 --> 43:48.742
Michel, What happen with you?

43:48.783 --> 43:55.241
"I can go to bed at two o clock"

43:55.241 --> 43:59.159
You have to get up at 12 o'clock,

43:59.159 --> 44:03.200
you have to go to bed till 12 o'clock.

44:03.241 --> 44:05.200
Get up at 12 o'clock.

44:05.241 --> 44:09.199
You see the first half of the night, one must sleep always, it's better.

44:09.408 --> 44:13.700
Second half of the night is the better part, alright?

44:13.909 --> 44:17.075
So the first half of the night you all have to sleep, anytime.

44:17.117 --> 44:20.200
You can sleep about 8 o'clock or 9 o'clock if you want to.

44:22.742 --> 44:25.950
But that should not be important, what time you sleep,

44:25.950 --> 44:29.075
you have to get up at 12 o'clock in the morning,

44:29.742 --> 44:31.909
or say after 12.

44:35.783 --> 44:38.867
Shri Krishna was born in the night about 12 o'clock.

44:38.867 --> 44:41.075
Nanaka was born 12 o'clock in the night.

44:41.075 --> 44:45.283
All the Gurus mostly took their birth at 12 o'clock in the night.

44:46.117 --> 44:51.742
To celebrate that, we must have one day when we do not sleep after 12.

44:52.408 --> 44:56.199
But then what about Caxton Hall!

44:56.658 --> 44:59.742
"Mother we can try this on Saturday.

44:59.825 --> 45:01.325
¿What?

45:01.825 --> 45:04.450
¿Can we do it in Saturday night? It will be more safe

45:04.783 --> 45:07.450
because will be less incidents the Sunday that Monday"

45:07.617 --> 45:15.117
Alright so you can sleep in the day time of Saturday or of Sunday.

45:15.575 --> 45:17.325
Sunday afternoon you can sleep.

45:17.408 --> 45:19.658
No, no, no that won't be alright.

45:22.491 --> 45:25.075
If you make any compensation

45:25.117 --> 45:27.783
then you are not torturing your body much!

45:29.700 --> 45:32.283
You must devise a method by which

45:32.325 --> 45:35.408
your body does see that it has to get up at 12 o'clock,

45:35.450 --> 45:36.825
Better keep it that time.

45:36.867 --> 45:39.199
What do you think ? Alright.

45:39.199 --> 45:43.408
"¿Do you think that this may affect the job on Monday?"

45:43.450 --> 45:45.491
¿What he said?

45:45.533 --> 45:47.700
"That the job of the people may be affected

45:47.700 --> 45:49.283
on Monday morning, Mother".

45:49.325 --> 45:54.742
They will never, take it from me, they will not:

45:54.742 --> 45:57.199
You see work is not important what is important

45:57.200 --> 46:02.700
is your Spirit, your mastery.

46:02.742 --> 46:06.241
Work, in any case you're not going to have after some time,

46:06.992 --> 46:09.241
so that work is not important.

46:09.283 --> 46:12.533
This new work that you have taken, better look after that.

46:12.533 --> 46:16.533
Forget about your work. Forget about these things.

46:16.575 --> 46:19.159
What is important is your Spirit.

46:19.199 --> 46:21.408
Otherwise you cannot become Gurus.

46:22.199 --> 46:24.199
Spirit is the most important thing.

46:24.200 --> 46:27.867
The rest of the things are absolutely unimportant,

46:27.867 --> 46:29.783
a zero.

46:32.617 --> 46:37.408
I've been very slowly trying to take you out

46:37.450 --> 46:41.867
of the mud of materialism and of these mundane things.

46:42.366 --> 46:47.491
But you have to work for God. You are special people.

46:49.034 --> 46:53.450
So, you have to make yourself a master,

46:55.159 --> 47:00.491
so God gives you all the blessings, everything.

47:01.491 --> 47:04.909
But the idea of luxurious life must be given up.

47:05.617 --> 47:09.117
People want to make this life luxurious,

47:09.992 --> 47:12.408
then you'll have the luxury of this world

47:12.450 --> 47:15.533
but not the luxury of God's blessings.

47:16.075 --> 47:18.159
One of the two you have to select.

47:18.617 --> 47:31.909
Either you lead a life which is luxurious on the material level,

47:32.034 --> 47:35.909
or you lead a luxurious life of God's blessings.

47:35.909 --> 47:38.783
One of the two you have to choose, the time has come.

47:39.241 --> 47:42.742
So nothing is important you see,

47:42.742 --> 47:46.117
the insecurity of money also is another nonsense.

47:46.117 --> 47:48.325
At least you people should not have it.

47:49.117 --> 47:51.742
I mean you will never starve at least,

47:51.783 --> 47:55.117
but Indians if they do not work they will starve.

47:57.450 --> 48:00.617
But you people can never starve, if you are unemployed,

48:00.617 --> 48:06.075
government is happy more, as long as you don't bother them.

48:06.950 --> 48:09.658
If you sit at home and meditate

48:09.700 --> 48:11.117
they'll be very happy.

48:12.159 --> 48:17.617
So to earn more money or to make more money

48:17.658 --> 48:19.825
is not important at all in Sahaja Yoga.

48:21.658 --> 48:24.742
Most important thing is to be the Spirit.

48:24.783 --> 48:26.992
For that whatever is to be done has to be done.

48:27.700 --> 48:33.491
Let everything suffer, you don't make your Spirit suffer.

48:36.075 --> 48:44.617
Because you have to become the full moon, like Guru Nanak.

48:45.283 --> 48:48.491
How much did Guru Nanak earn?

48:53.742 --> 49:01.034
You should find out, how did he live his life ?

49:06.825 --> 49:12.034
There is nothing to bother about money,

49:12.992 --> 49:16.075
because more money is not needed.

49:18.700 --> 49:23.199
Just needed for your food and your living.

49:24.700 --> 49:27.658
And then money is arranged if you need

49:27.658 --> 49:29.700
any extra money sometimes, emergencies.

49:29.742 --> 49:32.283
I've done it for many Australians, you know.

49:32.700 --> 49:36.742
But those are the people who have dedicated themselves fully.

49:38.909 --> 49:41.283
And that is why they have been helped,

49:41.325 --> 49:43.783
whenever there is an emergency they don't have to bother.

49:44.366 --> 49:49.241
But the dedication to your Spirit has to be full, complete,

49:49.867 --> 49:53.366
and nothing to your work, actually.

49:54.117 --> 49:56.783
Because that goes hand in hand.

49:57.617 --> 50:02.034
If you are not worried about yourself after realisation,

50:03.199 --> 50:07.283
about your Spirit, you'll have all the problems of the world.

50:07.867 --> 50:10.117
First and foremost is financial problems.

50:16.199 --> 50:25.199
Then, physical problem, mental problem, emotional problem.

50:25.867 --> 50:27.867
All kinds of problems will follow,

50:27.909 --> 50:31.909
because I've awakened your Kundalini; one part I've done.

50:32.867 --> 50:35.533
But another part that is your heart, you have not opened.

50:35.575 --> 50:37.867
You must give your heart to Sahaja Yoga.

50:38.408 --> 50:40.491
You have not opened your heart as yet.

50:41.200 --> 50:44.117
Heart has to be opened.

50:44.617 --> 50:47.075
You are still woried about your father, mother,

50:47.117 --> 50:48.950
brother, sister, wife, children.

50:49.658 --> 50:56.034
Open your heart fully to Sahaja Yoga.

50:56.617 --> 50:58.658
In a doubtless way.

50:59.200 --> 51:01.658
Then only doubt less awareness will settle down.

51:02.283 --> 51:05.034
Unless and until you open your heart,

51:05.200 --> 51:07.325
Kundalini rising has no meaning.

51:07.909 --> 51:12.408
Because the Kundalini is rising but the heart has not opened.

51:13.034 --> 51:17.117
If the Mother Earth sends forth her power through the seed

51:17.117 --> 51:20.199
and the seed doesn't open, then what's the use ?

51:20.199 --> 51:21.950
It's all a myth.

51:21.992 --> 51:24.199
Open your heart to Sahaja Yoga.

51:24.408 --> 51:27.117
Open your heart to Spirit, and say,

51:27.117 --> 51:29.075
"Mother we are the Spirit."

51:31.117 --> 51:32.700
You have to realize this,

51:32.742 --> 51:34.783
many people also perhaps do no realize

51:34.783 --> 51:38.575
that you have come on this earth to be the Spirit

51:39.034 --> 51:41.867
and not to be workers of human beings.

51:43.617 --> 51:49.408
You must understand your greatness and know

51:49.450 --> 51:53.450
that you are not like mundan people. That's why you are blessed.

51:54.075 --> 51:55.742
Who is blessed so much ?

51:56.325 --> 51:59.117
You are described long time back by Blake,

51:59.617 --> 52:02.408
that such and such people are going to come on this earth

52:02.450 --> 52:04.825
"men of God." Men of God.

52:06.366 --> 52:09.742
What do you have in your heart?

52:11.617 --> 52:14.992
Your heart will be like a stone.

52:15.491 --> 52:18.450
Unless and until there is light of the Spirit

52:18.450 --> 52:20.867
it is a stone heart,

52:20.909 --> 52:28.825
and this stone is going to hurt everyone, is going to ruin you completely.

52:29.283 --> 52:33.366
Open your heart hundred percent.

52:38.575 --> 52:41.034
You have met Indian Sahaja Yogis,

52:42.159 --> 52:43.742
they have problems of money.

52:44.742 --> 52:47.700
And how much they work for Sahaja Yoga,

52:48.159 --> 52:53.825
day in and day out how much they have contributed for Sahaja Yoga.

52:54.366 --> 52:59.199
You can imagine, about 7 lakhs of rupees they have collected,

52:59.199 --> 53:06.658
Rustom knows. 7 lakhs of rupees, they have collected for their ashram.

53:07.200 --> 53:16.325
7 lakhs is about £35000.£ 35000 they have collected only in Bombay.

53:16.617 --> 53:20.992
In Delhi they have collected about 5 lakhs, £ 25000.

53:23.909 --> 53:26.742
They are working, they have families they have children,

53:27.283 --> 53:30.867
but what they think about is nothing but Sahaja Yoga,

53:30.867 --> 53:32.909
nothing but Sahaja Yoga, nothing but Sahaja Yoga.

53:39.159 --> 53:42.783
They give most of their money for Sahaja Yoga, I think.

53:43.617 --> 53:45.366
They live with minimum.

53:45.909 --> 53:50.117
If I tell them why don't you buy another shirt for yourself,

53:50.783 --> 53:56.575
they will say, "Mother, I have worn lots of shirts in my previous life,"

53:59.199 --> 54:02.950
So satisfied ! "We have found the Atma now,

54:02.992 --> 54:05.325
let us dress up the Atma.

54:05.366 --> 54:09.491
We have found out our heart, let us become the heart".

54:09.533 --> 54:11.950
What is the need to worry about these things ?

54:11.992 --> 54:14.241
We have done enough of all this nonsense.

54:15.034 --> 54:19.491
I tell you they will think they are poor, but they are not.

54:20.909 --> 54:23.783
Wherever they can save their money they will save it.

54:24.283 --> 54:26.783
They used to give me some money before, I said,

54:26.825 --> 54:28.950
"No I don't need just now, there's no need"

54:28.950 --> 54:30.867
They said I have no place to keep;

54:30.909 --> 54:33.034
there is no trust, nothing, how are we to do it?

54:33.575 --> 54:43.533
They continued like this till about, I think, in, 74,

54:47.825 --> 54:51.283
when I went back we thought of starting an ashram,

54:51.325 --> 54:53.867
because you people were all coming there.

54:55.909 --> 55:01.617
So I said alright, now you have to give me money,

55:01.658 --> 55:04.783
all the Sahaja Yogis can give me money, whatever they have saved.

55:05.283 --> 55:08.325
And you'll be amazed everyone came out with 1000 rupees,

55:08.366 --> 55:13.533
every one of them, whether he was a labourer or every one of them,

55:13.575 --> 55:18.075
1000 rupees minimum. Up to 21 000.

55:18.825 --> 55:22.034
In 3 years time they had saved,

55:22.075 --> 55:23.950
because they thought it is our responsibility

55:23.992 --> 55:25.575
to save money for Sahaja Yoga.

55:25.617 --> 55:27.992
Tomorrow if we have to have an ashram how are we going to have ?

55:33.199 --> 55:35.950
But we still indulge into things.

55:43.742 --> 55:48.075
So this is what is the Gurupada.

55:48.117 --> 55:53.992
This Sir has to sit down, make an space for him.

55:54.034 --> 55:57.575
Come on, please. He doesn't need to be stand up. All right.

56:01.700 --> 56:05.366
So today is such a great day of Guru Nanaka's birthday,

56:06.325 --> 56:10.491
and we have to see his own life, how he spent his own life,

56:10.825 --> 56:16.992
how he lived and in what conditions he managed.

56:19.199 --> 56:24.034
So the first thing is to look after, disciplining yourself,

56:24.617 --> 56:28.283
feeling responsible for Sahaja Yoga.

56:29.117 --> 56:33.075
I was amazed people told, me that in the ashram

56:33.117 --> 56:38.199
people keep the lights on, and the oil costs so much,

56:38.200 --> 56:43.159
300 pounds every week. I'm amazed!

56:44.450 --> 56:48.700
Every one of you should be responsi-be for every electricity,

56:48.700 --> 56:52.408
everything that you spend here. This is God's place.

56:56.159 --> 57:00.325
Somebody has given the car, everybody wants to use the car.

57:00.366 --> 57:02.658
You see this saving the pounds

57:02.700 --> 57:05.117
is still going on the heads of Sahaja Yogis.

57:05.950 --> 57:09.117
If they can save by taking somebody's car they would borrow.

57:09.159 --> 57:10.575
Never borrow anybody's car.

57:10.575 --> 57:12.950
It's not for you, you must have your self respect,

57:12.950 --> 57:14.617
why to borrow anybody's car?

57:14.617 --> 57:16.992
It's not to be done.

57:20.199 --> 57:24.034
So the second point of the Self is self respect.

57:24.617 --> 57:27.783
First is the respect of your body,

57:28.325 --> 57:30.867
and the second is self-respect.

57:34.617 --> 57:38.825
We are arrogant, we can be rude,

57:40.658 --> 57:42.491
but we have no self respect.

57:51.617 --> 57:54.783
But it is the training that is lacking,

57:55.450 --> 57:57.783
you see suddenly I find after war

57:57.783 --> 58:03.992
there has been no teaching how to be self respecting.

58:06.199 --> 58:11.408
Like in the war, might be, the atmosphere might have been created I don't know why - that-

58:11.408 --> 58:14.117
"I´m above everything, don't care for others."

58:17.034 --> 58:20.199
May have been; I don't know why this kind of a thing has come,

58:20.199 --> 58:22.325
but it is so. Very prevalent.

58:22.366 --> 58:24.783
But you people have to be other way round:

58:25.283 --> 58:28.700
'Others are first and then yourself.

58:28.700 --> 58:30.325
With your self respect.

58:30.325 --> 58:33.658
Doesn't matter, nobody is going to die, I can tell you this much.

58:40.408 --> 58:45.366
You all must have self respect; and such mediocre people

58:45.825 --> 58:48.491
should not be allowed to stay in Sahaja Yoga,

58:51.199 --> 58:56.325
at least in the ashram, because it brings a bad name to all Sahaja Yoga.

58:56.325 --> 58:58.450
One person can spoil the whole.

58:58.950 --> 59:03.283
Only people who want to be Gurus have to stay in the ashram.

59:03.325 --> 59:06.117
It's not going to be made a convenience for anyone.

59:08.283 --> 59:12.199
But the other way around is that,

59:12.200 --> 59:14.825
"We are going to look after ourselves,

59:14.867 --> 59:17.950
we have to become this, we have to grow,

59:17.992 --> 59:19.658
we have to do it."

59:25.199 --> 59:29.159
Then it's just, the other way round, everything works out,

59:29.199 --> 59:31.034
I don't have to tell you.

59:31.075 --> 59:33.408
You know this is so base and so gross

59:33.867 --> 59:35.783
that after being here for so many years,

59:36.533 --> 59:41.199
you should all have become avadhutas by now, absolutely.

59:41.199 --> 59:43.700
Controlling all elements, everything, should have been possible;

59:44.241 --> 59:46.950
but stilI you are under the grip of the elements,

59:47.450 --> 59:49.366
how can you control it ?

59:56.325 --> 01:00:01.159
First of all get out of the slavery, this mental slavery.

01:00:03.075 --> 01:00:07.575
"Alright if it is there, it is there, if it is not there it doesn't matter.

01:00:07.617 --> 01:00:09.450
Nothing is more important than me,

01:00:09.867 --> 01:00:11.575
I am the king of the whole world.

01:00:11.617 --> 01:00:13.742
If I have to sleep on the ground I can sleep,

01:00:13.742 --> 01:00:15.700
if I have to sleep in the palaces I can sleep,

01:00:15.700 --> 01:00:19.575
nothing can dominate me." Then you are the master.

01:00:21.533 --> 01:00:23.867
You know in India, there are some Sahaja Yogis

01:00:23.909 --> 01:00:29.450
who are controlling definitely controlling, elements.

01:00:29.992 --> 01:00:33.408
We have examples of that, lots of things have been published

01:00:33.450 --> 01:00:36.199
you know in Nirmala Yoga, you must have heard.

01:00:36.909 --> 01:00:39.200
But you meet them, you'll find they are avadhutas

01:00:39.241 --> 01:00:41.825
and when they talk you feel a great sage is talking,

01:00:41.867 --> 01:00:44.491
and the way they behave, all the time you see their behaviour

01:00:44.533 --> 01:00:46.117
and everything is so great.

01:00:46.159 --> 01:00:47.825
We need people of that calibre today,

01:00:47.867 --> 01:00:50.533
because that is the situation of all nations.

01:00:53.867 --> 01:00:58.159
You have to be extra-good, because today is not a time

01:00:58.199 --> 01:01:01.325
when we can allow things to go, as they are.

01:01:05.617 --> 01:01:08.159
Or we are not just disciples,

01:01:08.159 --> 01:01:10.034
we all have to become gurus.

01:01:13.075 --> 01:01:17.408
And it is not the time when you can play with time.

01:01:17.408 --> 01:01:23.491
You cannot play with evil. You have to surmount it.

01:01:23.533 --> 01:01:25.325
You have to come on top of it, it is the time

01:01:25.366 --> 01:01:28.075
when the whole ship is going to be drowned or saved.

01:01:28.117 --> 01:01:29.783
This is the situation today.

01:01:30.366 --> 01:01:33.491
And that's why you have got your realization from God.

01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:36.325
If that precarious time had not arrived,

01:01:36.366 --> 01:01:39.366
how many of you really think you deserved it?

01:01:40.075 --> 01:01:45.742
But you got it, because the time is such that everybody

01:01:45.742 --> 01:01:49.366
must be given realization, and they must be given all powers

01:01:49.408 --> 01:01:51.200
so that they come up.

01:01:51.241 --> 01:01:53.117
But if you do not open your heart,

01:01:53.159 --> 01:01:55.491
put all your attention to your Spirit,

01:01:55.491 --> 01:01:57.700
these powers will not work out.

01:01:57.742 --> 01:01:59.742
None of these powers will work out in you.

01:02:00.575 --> 01:02:02.867
This is the problem.

01:02:02.867 --> 01:02:05.992
Every Guru had a command on the elements.

01:02:06.533 --> 01:02:08.909
Nanaka, you know definitely.

01:02:09.366 --> 01:02:15.366
People were sitting there and they asked him for the water

01:02:15.825 --> 01:02:21.533
and he put his hand on a rock and the water started pouring down.

01:02:22.950 --> 01:02:26.199
That's why it is called Punjab, Punja :

01:02:26.867 --> 01:02:31.658
five; and the five rivers exist there, too.

01:02:35.617 --> 01:02:40.200
It is said about all of them that they had powers over the elements.

01:02:42.950 --> 01:02:45.159
So how much we are lacking ?

01:02:45.159 --> 01:02:50.575
Still we are like other people who are selling cheap things,

01:02:51.241 --> 01:02:59.575
or who are busy making cheap things, or who are of no value.

01:03:00.283 --> 01:03:02.825
You are the ones who have to save the whole world.

01:03:04.742 --> 01:03:08.575
And the maximum of my life, blood and toil and everything,

01:03:08.617 --> 01:03:10.950
sweat, I've put in this land of yours.

01:03:11.491 --> 01:03:13.617
And the time is coming for me to go.

01:03:14.117 --> 01:03:19.783
Only three years more are left; before that,

01:03:19.825 --> 01:03:22.199
I hope, we establish an ashram.

01:03:22.241 --> 01:03:23.825
We need not pay for it,

01:03:23.825 --> 01:03:28.075
but, you have to be ready to occupy it,

01:03:28.075 --> 01:03:30.117
otherwise you cannot occupy it I can tell you,

01:03:30.117 --> 01:03:32.450
you cannot get any more blessings of God.

01:03:33.241 --> 01:03:35.241
So why should God bless you ?

01:03:35.241 --> 01:03:37.117
This is the point one should ask oneself.

01:03:37.159 --> 01:03:42.700
Are you your own Spirit or you are all else but the Spirit!

01:03:44.867 --> 01:03:49.909
But when I say something, it just goes as a big roaring,

01:03:50.700 --> 01:03:54.034
I don't know if the frequency has reached your ears or not,

01:03:54.075 --> 01:03:56.950
but I would request you now,

01:03:56.992 --> 01:04:00.575
as Gavin has asked me for Guru Nanaka's day,

01:04:00.575 --> 01:04:02.199
I really didn't want to come.

01:04:02.199 --> 01:04:05.450
Because to talk of Guru Nanaka and to hear about him,

01:04:07.408 --> 01:04:10.199
one has to be a very great person.

01:04:14.366 --> 01:04:19.241
Because such a light to bear, you have to make up yourself.

01:04:19.283 --> 01:04:22.034
Everything else is important,

01:04:25.450 --> 01:04:30.366
then how can you talk of Sahaja Yoga coming there.

01:04:33.992 --> 01:04:36.034
I went to America, I was surprised!

01:04:36.034 --> 01:04:37.909
Americans whatever it is, few people,

01:04:37.909 --> 01:04:40.366
but to them Sahaja Yoga is the most important thing.

01:04:40.408 --> 01:04:43.034
They talk of nothing but Sahaja Yoga, their life is Sahaja Yoga,

01:04:43.075 --> 01:04:45.783
morning till evening they are working out Sahaja Yoga,

01:04:45.825 --> 01:04:48.783
nothing else, they are not bothered.

01:04:48.783 --> 01:04:50.617
Australians you know.

01:04:56.075 --> 01:05:04.241
But the Heart is not open, the Spirit has not shown its light.

01:05:04.909 --> 01:05:12.992
It is the one that gives you complete satisfaction, complete joy,

01:05:13.909 --> 01:05:18.075
complete Guru's principle, because then you start giving.

01:05:18.117 --> 01:05:20.491
If there is no light what are you giving? Darkness ?

01:05:22.783 --> 01:05:24.617
What are you giving to others ?

01:05:25.366 --> 01:05:29.408
The darkness that is within you, if you are going to give that....

01:05:32.783 --> 01:05:44.159
So the second phase, has to be, as I have told you, to have self respect.

01:05:45.034 --> 01:05:48.366
-

01:05:48.408 --> 01:05:51.909
-

01:05:55.283 --> 01:05:58.117
-

01:05:58.950 --> 01:06:05.366

01:06:07.199 --> 01:06:18.366

01:06:21.491 --> 01:06:27.825

01:06:27.867 --> 01:06:30.159

01:06:31.241 --> 01:06:34.867

01:06:34.909 --> 01:06:38.700
-

01:06:41.075 --> 01:06:43.450

01:06:44.325 --> 01:06:46.783
-

01:06:47.325 --> 01:06:49.283

01:06:51.117 --> 01:06:53.742

01:06:53.742 --> 01:06:57.283

01:07:10.867 --> 01:07:14.408

01:07:16.950 --> 01:07:20.075

01:07:20.075 --> 01:07:22.241
-

01:07:23.159 --> 01:07:26.199
-

01:07:26.200 --> 01:07:27.909
-

01:07:27.909 --> 01:07:30.617
-

01:07:30.658 --> 01:07:32.159
-

01:07:32.199 --> 01:07:38.199
-

01:07:38.199 --> 01:07:41.199
-

01:07:41.199 --> 01:07:43.909

01:07:43.950 --> 01:07:48.075

01:07:48.117 --> 01:07:50.200

01:07:50.241 --> 01:07:57.199

01:08:47.199 --> 01:08:49.867

01:08:49.909 --> 01:08:59.950

01:08:59.992 --> 01:09:04.241

01:09:04.241 --> 01:09:08.909

01:11:56.325 --> 01:11:59.909
-

01:11:59.909 --> 01:12:06.366
The one who out fishes and sells them in the market.

01:12:07.325 --> 01:12:10.783
But his body is so well built and shining

01:12:10.783 --> 01:12:13.742
and the muscles so developed and the man,

01:12:13.783 --> 01:12:15.825
he stands up and the way he talks!

01:12:15.825 --> 01:12:17.909
And absolutely humble person.

01:12:24.200 --> 01:12:26.783
No wonder Christ chose fishermen.

01:12:27.825 --> 01:12:32.075
While he has got thousands of fishermen as his disciples,

01:12:32.575 --> 01:12:34.783
but he doesn't call them disciples,

01:12:34.825 --> 01:12:36.159
he says they are all Mother's children.

01:12:36.700 --> 01:12:38.533
Thousands! You don't know.

01:12:38.575 --> 01:12:40.617
He has been calling me to go to them,

01:12:40.617 --> 01:12:42.825
and all that but they come to my programme, some of them.

01:12:44.159 --> 01:12:47.241
And one day I have to go down, to those islands,

01:12:47.241 --> 01:12:49.742
any one of the islands he said you come they will be all there

01:12:49.742 --> 01:12:51.575
the whole day waiting for you.

01:12:51.617 --> 01:12:56.075
But the way he is there is surprising.

01:12:58.408 --> 01:13:02.159
When I am there he brings fishes for me.

01:13:02.199 --> 01:13:06.491
But I said, you see, I eat fishes that you bring

01:13:06.533 --> 01:13:08.742
but what about my other children.

01:13:08.783 --> 01:13:12.783
He said no, next time, all the fishes will be sent to you.

01:13:12.825 --> 01:13:14.992
And he sent one truck-load to me, you would not believe!

01:13:15.575 --> 01:13:18.658
I said now I don't even have truck-load of disciples,

01:13:18.658 --> 01:13:20.491
who is going to eat all this?

01:13:23.533 --> 01:13:26.408
And he said, "Nothing, I just went and told fishermen

01:13:26.408 --> 01:13:29.241
that Mother has asked for fishes and everybody gave their fishes.

01:13:29.491 --> 01:13:31.075
One day they will not have fishes,

01:13:31.117 --> 01:13:33.199
what is there, what does it matter."

01:13:33.199 --> 01:13:36.909
Imagine those people who live day-to-day in that country.

01:13:39.909 --> 01:13:44.241
Modi told the newspaper people

01:13:44.283 --> 01:13:46.575
that we can control the elements

01:13:46.617 --> 01:13:48.325
somehow by Mother's grace.

01:13:48.366 --> 01:13:52.199
So the newspaper people felt they were very much boasting.

01:13:52.199 --> 01:13:55.450
But it is true, they can.

01:13:57.450 --> 01:14:01.117
To them it is not boasting it is just what it is they are seeing.

01:14:01.117 --> 01:14:04.200
They are telling the truth, you see.

01:14:04.241 --> 01:14:05.700
But that should happen.

01:14:05.742 --> 01:14:07.408
We should also have some things

01:14:07.450 --> 01:14:09.283
to boast here. Important.

01:14:09.283 --> 01:14:13.992
So now we have the other phase as I told you,

01:14:14.034 --> 01:14:24.034
is of becoming the Guru of yourself.

01:14:24.617 --> 01:14:28.742
Detaching yourself, identifying yourself with the Spirit

01:14:28.783 --> 01:14:30.658
which is growing in its light.

01:14:32.825 --> 01:14:36.575
So detachment. One has to develop detachment.

01:14:37.159 --> 01:14:39.450
'My' mother, it starts like that;

01:14:39.491 --> 01:14:45.450
my mother is suffering from cancer, my father is suffering from madness,

01:14:46.075 --> 01:14:47.909
Mother can you cure them ?

01:14:50.491 --> 01:14:52.992
So now first I cure mother and father.

01:14:53.491 --> 01:14:56.283
Then I'm married, my wife is like this,

01:14:56.325 --> 01:15:05.199
my child is like this then my house, then my motorcar,

01:15:05.491 --> 01:15:08.658
then my dog, then my umbrella!

01:15:12.034 --> 01:15:18.867
I have to go suddenly from A to Z, from Z to A.

01:15:21.491 --> 01:15:33.034
Alright, I can do, up to a point, but for what? For what?

01:15:33.617 --> 01:15:37.533
Why to cure the mother, father, brother, sisters,

01:15:37.533 --> 01:15:42.658
every relationship, the 10th marriage and the 11th divorce ?

01:15:43.199 --> 01:15:46.199
Why to correct all this? For what?

01:15:49.742 --> 01:15:55.408
It must have some purpose, and if that purpose cannot be served,

01:15:55.992 --> 01:15:58.783
what is the use of doing it?

01:15:59.533 --> 01:16:05.658
The purpose is that you at least leave all these things in my hands

01:16:06.199 --> 01:16:07.992
and detach yourself.

01:16:08.034 --> 01:16:11.117
But you want to bring the case to Me as well as worry about it.

01:16:12.241 --> 01:16:14.450
Detachment.

01:16:16.992 --> 01:16:20.075
But the idea of detachment is this!

01:16:20.075 --> 01:16:23.575
"I'm very detached about money, Mother, absolutely.

01:16:23.617 --> 01:16:26.283
I'm not bothered. I keep the lights on,

01:16:26.325 --> 01:16:27.950
why to worry about money ?"

01:16:30.199 --> 01:16:31.992
This is the argument,

01:16:31.992 --> 01:16:36.200
"Why should we worry about looking after the gas and all that,

01:16:36.241 --> 01:16:41.034
after all we are detached people. We are in detachment, you see.

01:16:41.909 --> 01:16:43.742
We are not attached to money."

01:16:43.909 --> 01:16:45.575
But who is going to pay ?

01:16:47.825 --> 01:16:52.658
The other type of detachment that. I see, very interesting one is this one:

01:16:53.241 --> 01:16:59.325
"I'm very detached, so I'm not bothered about having a bath,

01:17:01.867 --> 01:17:03.575
having all kinds of diseases,

01:17:03.992 --> 01:17:06.617
having all kinds of problems within myself,

01:17:06.700 --> 01:17:09.283
giving my problems to others. I'm detached!

01:17:09.742 --> 01:17:13.408
Why should I cover myself ? I'm detached.

01:17:13.825 --> 01:17:16.075
If I get cold, I'm detached,

01:17:16.408 --> 01:17:18.408
let everybody get cold from me.

01:17:19.783 --> 01:17:21.825
What can I do, I'm detached.

01:17:22.366 --> 01:17:24.825
I've got cold, so what does it matter,

01:17:24.825 --> 01:17:26.325
I'm a detached personality.

01:17:26.408 --> 01:17:27.742
Why should others mind?

01:17:27.742 --> 01:17:29.617
They should also get detached."

01:17:35.283 --> 01:17:38.241
This is the ridiculous limit we can go

01:17:38.283 --> 01:17:44.366
in our idea of detachment! Detachment is from within.

01:17:44.366 --> 01:17:53.159
You are not bothered. You are not bothered.

01:17:53.159 --> 01:17:55.366
You know your Mother.

01:17:56.199 --> 01:17:59.992
The first detachment is shown in generosity.

01:18:00.909 --> 01:18:11.117
Detachment is generosity. Grezna is.

01:18:11.533 --> 01:18:14.617
She sold her ornaments for nothing at all.

01:18:14.658 --> 01:18:16.575
I mean I would never have accepted that money,

01:18:16.617 --> 01:18:19.575
but she just sold them. It's remarkable.

01:18:20.117 --> 01:18:27.366
She sold them She is Polish not English. She sold her ornaments ;

01:18:27.408 --> 01:18:29.575
and this is what communism has done to people.

01:18:29.742 --> 01:18:31.241
They are very detached,

01:18:31.283 --> 01:18:33.700
communists are very detached people I tell you.

01:18:36.617 --> 01:18:41.825
Of course I would never take that money, that's theirs,

01:18:41.867 --> 01:18:44.867
but the way she did it, just like that.

01:18:44.867 --> 01:18:51.034
For God's work alright what is ornaments, take it.

01:18:51.075 --> 01:18:55.992
I mean you know I've given away so many of my ornaments

01:18:56.034 --> 01:18:57.992
to keep relations alright.

01:19:00.617 --> 01:19:03.742
The other day I gave away my Kara to Christine,

01:19:03.742 --> 01:19:05.700
you know that when she got engaged.

01:19:05.700 --> 01:19:07.867
Just it came out of the hand and went away.

01:19:07.909 --> 01:19:13.241
I was detached you see, I never even felt the coming out !

01:19:14.783 --> 01:19:16.408
So much detached that Christine told me

01:19:16.450 --> 01:19:21.159
she was cramped up with pressure but to me it was just, just nothing.

01:19:21.950 --> 01:19:32.658
Dust. So that detachment has to come.

01:19:32.700 --> 01:19:37.241
Now you should know which part you are there.

01:19:37.241 --> 01:19:42.867
Like idea of detachment should not be

01:19:42.909 --> 01:19:47.742
that - I would say hippy style of detachment,

01:19:47.783 --> 01:19:49.950
that you have right to exploit everybody else.

01:19:51.909 --> 01:19:54.950
And the other type as I told you. which is very ridiculous.

01:19:55.450 --> 01:19:58.491
It's not an idea, it's a thing,

01:19:58.491 --> 01:20:02.408
it's your awareness itself which is detached.

01:20:09.283 --> 01:20:15.283
So, these four things for your material side is important.

01:20:17.408 --> 01:20:23.034
What you eat is not so important,

01:20:23.075 --> 01:20:24.450
because whatever you eat,

01:20:24.491 --> 01:20:26.867
if the brain is going to be such a non-sensical thing

01:20:26.909 --> 01:20:30.325
it's better whether you eat it or not, makes no difference does it?

01:20:30.366 --> 01:20:34.159
Analyze it, like in the hotel, what will you have,

01:20:34.159 --> 01:20:36.159
" I'll have pancakes," what will you have,

01:20:36.159 --> 01:20:38.283
" I'll have this I'll have that", for what ?

01:20:38.825 --> 01:20:41.034
I just don't understand why waste so much energy,

01:20:41.075 --> 01:20:43.700
why not you all have pancakes all of you put together.

01:20:44.950 --> 01:20:49.533
It's a very big thing you know. Or, today I'll have this.

01:20:49.533 --> 01:20:56.575
"I". Out of all this materialism what comes out is Mr "I".

01:20:58.700 --> 01:21:01.075
So we develop this Mr I.

01:21:01.700 --> 01:21:06.075
So the word "I" must go away, we should speak "we".

01:21:07.825 --> 01:21:13.325
"We" means you and all the Sahaja Yogis put together.

01:21:15.117 --> 01:21:19.075
When you say "we" you will find it will be different.

01:21:19.075 --> 01:21:22.491
Or take your name, like "this Norman."

01:21:23.533 --> 01:21:28.283
"This Norman won't listen," like children say.

01:21:28.325 --> 01:21:31.950
I asked a little boy, will you go home ? "

01:21:32.450 --> 01:21:39.658
I will go, but this (his name was Munna) this Munna, won't go,

01:21:39.700 --> 01:21:50.117
he's very obstinate, what can I do ?" This is detachment.

01:21:50.700 --> 01:21:53.159
To speak in third person is detachment,

01:21:53.159 --> 01:21:58.658
in which you are not in the picture...

01:21:58.700 --> 01:22:00.283
you are a witness.

01:22:00.325 --> 01:22:01.491
You are the witness in the show.

01:22:01.533 --> 01:22:05.325
So this detachment should work in such a way

01:22:05.366 --> 01:22:07.325
that you should witness the whole show,

01:22:07.325 --> 01:22:08.867
you're not involved into it.

01:22:08.909 --> 01:22:13.617
But just see what happens, in collectivity also.

01:22:15.199 --> 01:22:17.950
It becomes a political issue certainly,

01:22:17.992 --> 01:22:22.117
in Sahaja Yoga also, political issue; nothing short of political issue!

01:22:22.658 --> 01:22:29.491
We are not here fighting like union leaders.

01:22:30.200 --> 01:22:34.575
We are all leaders ! Where is the time to fight?

01:22:39.700 --> 01:22:43.159
Whom are we to fight , that we have to decide.

01:22:43.742 --> 01:22:47.575
So, as far as all these things concerned,

01:22:47.575 --> 01:22:51.700
are detachment and attachment to Spirit.

01:22:54.491 --> 01:22:56.241
So we go further,

01:22:56.283 --> 01:23:00.617
see now what should be our attitude on our mental level.

01:23:02.366 --> 01:23:08.159
Physically you have seen that you have to develop

01:23:08.159 --> 01:23:12.366
a complete detachment in these four ways that I have told you.

01:23:12.992 --> 01:23:16.617
Now on your mental level what you have to do,

01:23:17.366 --> 01:23:27.825
is to understand the essence of every writing,

01:23:28.325 --> 01:23:33.159
try to discriminate between Vidya and avidya.

01:23:33.325 --> 01:23:41.742
Because avidya will kill you, will take away your energy,

01:23:42.325 --> 01:23:45.366
but vidya will sustain.

01:23:45.950 --> 01:23:51.491
So try to find out books which are supporting vidya.

01:23:51.950 --> 01:23:54.909
I was surprised, there is a lady Barbara,

01:23:54.909 --> 01:23:56.950
she met only last time Gavin,

01:23:56.950 --> 01:24:00.575
and she has written such a tremendous book, you'd be amazed!

01:24:01.992 --> 01:24:05.742
I mean of such a level on Sahaja Yoga ! Very direct.

01:24:05.783 --> 01:24:10.283
I'll show you that, and you know that book is now being considered

01:24:10.325 --> 01:24:13.575
for giving her a.doctorate, can you believe it I

01:24:13.575 --> 01:24:15.491
In an American university;

01:24:15.533 --> 01:24:17.117
of course that's only possible in America.

01:24:17.159 --> 01:24:23.159
But still that book has that level,

01:24:23.159 --> 01:24:25.075
I was amazed at the book!

01:24:25.117 --> 01:24:31.658
So try to gather nourishment, like reading Devi Mahatmya,

01:24:31.700 --> 01:24:34.199
reading about, finding out about Bible

01:24:34.200 --> 01:24:38.450
and finding about other scriptures, about Koran - this that,

01:24:38.491 --> 01:24:41.909
and which supports you, which nourishes you.

01:24:43.325 --> 01:24:51.825
Blake, Kabir, Nanaka. I mean there are so many, Laotze.

01:24:52.700 --> 01:24:56.950
This is the good - is the knowledge. But you'll be amazed,

01:24:56.950 --> 01:24:59.491
once you start doing it, it comes to you.

01:24:59.491 --> 01:25:06.408
I met a man near Rahuri - as you know we go there,

01:25:09.199 --> 01:25:12.950
and there's a man who just drives a bullock cart,

01:25:13.742 --> 01:25:17.783
and he had brought the bullock cart to take me down

01:25:18.241 --> 01:25:20.909
to one of the programmes, you know what we do there.

01:25:20.909 --> 01:25:24.199
And he was sitting there, we were waiting, I was talking, to him.

01:25:24.199 --> 01:25:27.117
And I felt an Avadhuta is sitting there to drive me,

01:25:27.117 --> 01:25:30.700
I mean uneducated absolutely, he's never known books,

01:25:30.742 --> 01:25:33.241
he does not know how to write, but the way he was talking I said,

01:25:33.283 --> 01:25:36.366
"Oh God, from where this knowledge!

01:25:41.450 --> 01:25:44.159
From where was all this coming, this wisdom!

01:25:44.199 --> 01:25:45.909
Such wisdom, I tell you!''

01:25:46.575 --> 01:25:50.366
Such wisdom that I was just stunned, I was stunned really!

01:25:50.408 --> 01:25:54.658
From a man who is not even been to any school-college.

01:25:54.700 --> 01:25:56.992
Christ did not go to any school or college.

01:25:59.034 --> 01:26:01.075
Such wisdom, you can't imagine.

01:26:01.117 --> 01:26:03.241
You meet him next time when you go there.

01:26:03.867 --> 01:26:08.950
If somebody could translate him... you feel like touching his feet

01:26:08.950 --> 01:26:11.700
the way - extremely unassuming simple man,

01:26:11.700 --> 01:26:18.992
wearing a white, clean topi and clean dress and driving me down.

01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:22.658
And to him this was the greatest privilege of the whole world --

01:26:22.700 --> 01:26:25.992
is to drive me; he said "It must be the greatest of all --

01:26:26.034 --> 01:26:28.658
something I must have done - to be able to drive you."

01:26:29.200 --> 01:26:33.075
And in such simple ways he was explaining to me

01:26:33.075 --> 01:26:36.159
about the character of the bullocks and the human beings --

01:26:36.742 --> 01:26:40.742
just imagine! And the things he talked about,

01:26:40.783 --> 01:26:43.491
if I tell you, you won't believe - so I just don't know...

01:26:44.366 --> 01:26:50.742
That's the sign of a great man, he doesn't talk of frivolous things,

01:26:50.742 --> 01:26:52.825
he has no time to talk about frivolous things.

01:26:52.825 --> 01:26:54.408
I have seen my own grandchildren --

01:26:54.450 --> 01:26:56.575
they never talk of frivolous things, they have no time,

01:26:56.575 --> 01:26:58.117
they are busy, you know.

01:26:58.117 --> 01:27:00.700
All the time clearing out, when they came here, they said

01:27:00.700 --> 01:27:02.366
"We have to clear out this Brompton Square,

01:27:02.408 --> 01:27:04.491
then we have to clear out this Knights bridge,

01:27:04.491 --> 01:27:06.117
then we have to clear out this London,

01:27:06.159 --> 01:27:07.909
then we have to clear out this England.

01:27:07.950 --> 01:27:09.450
Where is the map of England, bring it,"

01:27:09.450 --> 01:27:12.075
all the time they were busy, you see, clearing out, and then,

01:27:12.117 --> 01:27:13.575
"this place is this, this place is this.

01:27:13.575 --> 01:27:15.408
Oh God this horrible,

01:27:15.408 --> 01:27:17.159
bring some shoes, do this do that,"

01:27:17.159 --> 01:27:19.700
all the time they were busy morning till evening.

01:27:19.742 --> 01:27:22.658
They would go upstairs in the room and they are busy.

01:27:22.700 --> 01:27:24.450
They are busy people, they have no time to talk

01:27:24.491 --> 01:27:26.034
of the mundane things and all that.

01:27:26.034 --> 01:27:28.159
Then I brought some dolls and toys, for them.

01:27:28.199 --> 01:27:32.241
They put all of them there and they put them, and the map there,

01:27:32.241 --> 01:27:36.199
"now see now, (to dolls) now you look after, alright ?"

01:27:36.241 --> 01:27:39.658
You know they're talking to dolls like that.

01:27:39.700 --> 01:27:41.617
Dolls are their disciples. Teaching the dolls,

01:27:41.658 --> 01:27:45.408
"you see, don't sit like this, you must sit properly, you don't know.

01:27:45.408 --> 01:27:46.992
You can't bend your knees ?

01:27:47.034 --> 01:27:49.034
Better learn that, you must learn to bend your knees,"

01:27:49.075 --> 01:27:51.658
because dolls have straight legs!

01:27:56.491 --> 01:27:59.742
And all the boys, even the little children,

01:27:59.783 --> 01:28:02.825
I have seen the way they are busy all the time doing Sahaja Yoga.

01:28:05.325 --> 01:28:09.366
Every level they are working.

01:28:10.617 --> 01:28:16.283
As today I was telling Rustom about my own father.

01:28:17.117 --> 01:28:19.075
You see, he was a learned man, of course.

01:28:19.075 --> 01:28:23.992
But when he talked, he used to talk of something,

01:28:23.992 --> 01:28:28.992
like I told him about the state of a person, called Sambhranta.

01:28:29.575 --> 01:28:34.075
He told me that, "Human beings are very different from God.

01:28:34.575 --> 01:28:38.241
When God incarnates then the Sambhranta state,

01:28:38.283 --> 01:28:41.034
which is awakening between the subconscious

01:28:41.075 --> 01:28:46.992
to the conscious state, is direct, you see.

01:28:46.992 --> 01:28:49.200
He comes down directly But human beings

01:28:49.241 --> 01:28:53.950
go this way, they never go straight.

01:28:54.450 --> 01:28:56.992
See God descends, so he descends properly,

01:28:57.034 --> 01:28:59.950
but ascent is always in a very separate way.

01:28:59.992 --> 01:29:02.617
It goes on like this, and he gathers everything

01:29:02.658 --> 01:29:06.408
that is in his subconscious, so the Sambhranta state,

01:29:06.450 --> 01:29:09.742
where he is waking up, is such a dangerous thing

01:29:09.742 --> 01:29:11.283
that he can gather up anything.

01:29:11.325 --> 01:29:14.950
And by the time he gathers up the dreams he becomes something so funny.

01:29:15.034 --> 01:29:19.909
He may look at God whom he has seen in his dream

01:29:19.950 --> 01:29:23.241
like a witch, and the witch like a bird."

01:29:23.867 --> 01:29:32.533
I saw him always busy. I mean to talk to him,

01:29:32.533 --> 01:29:36.783
I found a companion and he found me a companion sort of a thing.

01:29:36.825 --> 01:29:39.159
He could talk, because his attention was there.

01:29:39.159 --> 01:29:42.075
His attention was not how every body has made their hair,

01:29:42.075 --> 01:29:45.575
and how they are sitting down or what dresses they are making,

01:29:45.617 --> 01:29:47.742
or what do you have in this thing - nothing.

01:29:47.783 --> 01:29:53.575
His attention was on the Spirit, his own Spirit and Spirit of others.

01:29:53.617 --> 01:30:01.241
And he was so dynamic in his brain that he knew your dictionary

01:30:01.241 --> 01:30:02.491
by heart, I tell you.

01:30:02.491 --> 01:30:04.700
He never consulted dictionary all his life --

01:30:04.700 --> 01:30:08.700
neither Sanskrit nor English, and he was master of 14 languages.

01:30:08.700 --> 01:30:14.825
Can you imagine! How he must have managed!

01:30:14.867 --> 01:30:18.450
He used to play tennis very well, he used to swim for 3 miles every day.

01:30:18.450 --> 01:30:21.992
3 miles. He had muscles that he could just lift you up. Yes!

01:30:24.950 --> 01:30:29.491
Very healthy personality, healthy man.

01:30:29.533 --> 01:30:31.992
Very generous, very generous.

01:30:32.034 --> 01:30:34.450
Much more generous than me, so you can imagine.

01:30:34.491 --> 01:30:36.992
Very generous, to him nothing mattered,

01:30:37.034 --> 01:30:38.700
"alright you like it, take it".

01:30:38.700 --> 01:30:42.283
He'll starve himself but he'll be generous.

01:30:42.325 --> 01:30:46.200
And a man of principle.

01:30:46.241 --> 01:30:51.825
So we come to the second point which is actually

01:30:51.867 --> 01:30:54.617
we have started the fifth one - which is mentally

01:30:54.658 --> 01:30:59.283
you must only take to things which are nourishing.

01:31:03.408 --> 01:31:05.283
Through vibratory awareness you will know.

01:31:05.283 --> 01:31:09.491
Ask other Sahaja Yogis, if you do not know.

01:31:09.909 --> 01:31:12.491
But take nourishing things to read and not horrible,

01:31:12.533 --> 01:31:14.783
detrimental to your growth.

01:31:14.825 --> 01:31:17.366
If you read them, you are responsible:

01:31:17.408 --> 01:31:22.241
You are real great readers I must say --

01:31:22.283 --> 01:31:24.575
you ask any name, everyone knows.

01:31:24.617 --> 01:31:26.408
I said who was Gropius, everyone knows.

01:31:26.450 --> 01:31:28.283
You need not be an academician to tell.

01:31:28.283 --> 01:31:31.950
Everyone knows, what happened, who is this, who is that.

01:31:31.950 --> 01:31:35.034
Out of your seeking you have done one good thing --

01:31:35.075 --> 01:31:37.491
to have read everything whether good or bad,

01:31:37.491 --> 01:31:39.366
whatever it is.

01:31:39.408 --> 01:31:41.700
But now after realisation, you must try to find out

01:31:41.700 --> 01:31:44.199
what you have to read, what you have to know,

01:31:44.199 --> 01:31:45.950
it should be nourishing.

01:31:45.950 --> 01:31:49.909
Talk that is nourishing, helpful.

01:31:49.950 --> 01:31:55.533
So in talk you should have compassion.

01:31:55.533 --> 01:32:00.283
If you are talking to someone you should be full of compassion.

01:32:00.325 --> 01:32:02.491
Sahaja Yoga is a system of compassion.

01:32:02.491 --> 01:32:07.159
A Guru has to be very-very patient.

01:32:07.199 --> 01:32:10.408
It is not like other Gurudom,

01:32:10.825 --> 01:32:13.658
or even real Gurus had no patience.

01:32:14.533 --> 01:32:19.867
This is a system where patience is the only way it will work out,

01:32:19.909 --> 01:32:22.075
because no Gurus gave realisation, it is only you

01:32:22.075 --> 01:32:24.533
who have to give it. And you know what is realisation.

01:32:24.575 --> 01:32:29.199
The other day we met one; the fellow sitting tight.

01:32:29.200 --> 01:32:37.117
They said, "We have failed Mother, we can't give him realisation,

01:32:37.159 --> 01:32:38.867
it's a hopeless case". I said, "Really ?"

01:32:38.867 --> 01:32:41.950
So I went there - at the end of it you see, they said,

01:32:41.992 --> 01:32:43.408
"Mother there's one fellow sitting".

01:32:43.450 --> 01:32:46.491
I wanted to aviod, you see, but they said.

01:32:46.533 --> 01:32:52.783
Alright, so raised his Kundalini, raised it up, tied it up,

01:32:52.825 --> 01:32:57.992
my hands bearing now. "Oh no, I didn't feel anything".

01:32:58.034 --> 01:33:04.992
I said, this fellow is least bothered

01:33:05.034 --> 01:33:07.199
how much we are working on him!

01:33:07.200 --> 01:33:09.199
He's just thinking he's obliging us."

01:33:09.199 --> 01:33:12.617
So then two or three people came forward, brought a light,

01:33:12.617 --> 01:33:16.075
put the light before him, did bandhan here and everything:

01:33:16.117 --> 01:33:20.034
Again I raised his Kundalini thrice:

01:33:20.075 --> 01:33:25.950
"No, not at all... ! "it went on like that for half an hour,

01:33:25.950 --> 01:33:27.283
then I gave up. I said,

01:33:27.325 --> 01:33:29.075
"Sir, I'm sorry, you are too great

01:33:29.075 --> 01:33:33.408
for realisation! We'll try again".

01:33:33.408 --> 01:33:39.700
"I'm not convinced..." And I was fagged out,

01:33:39.742 --> 01:33:43.200
I said "Really, I am convinced about you,

01:33:43.241 --> 01:33:45.825
so, you allow us to go", and then I came out.

01:33:45.867 --> 01:33:48.950
You have to have 'tremendous' patience and sense of humour --

01:33:48.992 --> 01:33:50.867
you just can't tell him off.

01:33:50.909 --> 01:33:53.283
You see if I told him ''You are good for nothing, useless,

01:33:53.283 --> 01:33:57.867
you have a bad Kundalini you go away from here get away, get lost."

01:33:57.867 --> 01:34:04.617
I couldn't say these things to him, I had to bear him through and not only,

01:34:04.617 --> 01:34:07.825
in the end I had to say you are a great man, you see.

01:34:07.867 --> 01:34:10.950
Because otherwise he would have used some other method.

01:34:10.950 --> 01:34:13.658
Because, already the ego was so big

01:34:13.658 --> 01:34:16.950
that with all the pins I put inside it, it could not deflate,

01:34:16.950 --> 01:34:19.783
it was made of a special fibre I think !

01:34:23.700 --> 01:34:26.075
It was such a difficult task.

01:34:26.117 --> 01:34:29.408
So one has to know that we have to be compassionate.

01:34:29.450 --> 01:34:34.075
We have to read something that nourishes our compassion.

01:34:34.117 --> 01:34:39.199
Read of people who gave away everything that they had.

01:34:39.200 --> 01:34:45.658
Tukarama. Read Tukarama. Tukarama was a poor man.

01:34:45.700 --> 01:34:50.450
And one day he went to some place and did some good job,

01:34:50.491 --> 01:34:56.034
so they gave him lots of sugar cane.

01:34:56.408 --> 01:34:58.950
His children were very fond of sugar cane.

01:34:59.992 --> 01:35:02.992
So on the way every child would ask, "give me one sugar cane".

01:35:03.034 --> 01:35:04.450
He was giving to everyone.

01:35:04.450 --> 01:35:06.241
When he came home only one was left.

01:35:06.283 --> 01:35:08.783
So the children said, "we are three".

01:35:08.783 --> 01:35:12.075
He said, "It's alright; next time I will bring for you,

01:35:12.117 --> 01:35:15.950
share it among you three". And they had it,

01:35:15.992 --> 01:35:18.825
they said, "better have it, now one more child will come

01:35:18.825 --> 01:35:20.450
and this will also go away".

01:35:22.992 --> 01:35:26.867
So one has to know about lives who have been giving.

01:35:28.325 --> 01:35:31.408
Read about people who have been giving.

01:35:32.075 --> 01:35:38.117
They gave their lives. They crucified them, they tortured them.

01:35:38.159 --> 01:35:40.325
They allowed to be exploited.

01:35:40.366 --> 01:35:42.408
They allowed to be poisoned.

01:35:42.408 --> 01:35:46.575
Head of such sacrifice, of great sacrifices.

01:35:46.617 --> 01:35:49.783
We are lucky people that we have seen all those things

01:35:49.825 --> 01:35:51.325
with our own eyes.

01:35:51.325 --> 01:35:54.783
But at least you be one of them, that you can at least,

01:35:54.825 --> 01:36:00.325
if not see, visualise it. You can. Bring that as your principle.

01:36:00.366 --> 01:36:06.617
So we move now, from detachment,

01:36:06.658 --> 01:36:10.533
which I've told you four types of detachment,

01:36:10.575 --> 01:36:16.450
and then I told you the nourishment of your mind

01:36:17.199 --> 01:36:19.909
and nourishment to your heart.

01:36:20.366 --> 01:36:27.075
Nothing nourishes more to a person than giving away.

01:36:27.575 --> 01:36:32.450
Nothing nourishes your heart, your compassion,

01:36:32.491 --> 01:36:34.658
unless and until you learn to give away.

01:36:34.825 --> 01:36:37.075
Now will you please make a list of things,

01:36:37.075 --> 01:36:43.117
"how many things you have given away in this one year, last one year".

01:36:43.159 --> 01:36:44.867
I can't because it is too much.

01:36:47.617 --> 01:36:51.700
Please make a list of things, "how many things",

01:36:51.742 --> 01:36:56.117
except for your brains you have given away to others

01:36:56.742 --> 01:37:02.533
without thinking about it, or have thought of giving.

01:37:06.700 --> 01:37:10.658
Since Christmas let us say, to this Christmas.

01:37:15.867 --> 01:37:23.867
Heart is opening. Think of giving.

01:37:25.325 --> 01:37:31.491
On material level, other help is there to give.

01:37:31.533 --> 01:37:36.575
But no, we don't even give the other help,

01:37:36.992 --> 01:37:39.450
for which you don't have to spend any money.

01:37:39.491 --> 01:37:41.117
Just give a hand.

01:37:41.783 --> 01:37:45.909
I have seen, very easy to make out,

01:37:46.491 --> 01:37:48.658
labour saving devices.

01:37:50.700 --> 01:37:54.742
Now, I have come here, some will be running,

01:37:54.783 --> 01:37:56.617
others are just sitting.

01:37:56.617 --> 01:38:00.199
Tea is brought to them, food is brought of them everything is done.

01:38:00.200 --> 01:38:03.617
They'll just put the plate also before: go and wash.

01:38:09.700 --> 01:38:16.199
Its not only selfishness but it is unmannerly, unmannerly to be like this.

01:38:20.034 --> 01:38:26.408
In Sahaja Yoga you have to be

01:38:26.408 --> 01:38:31.200
extremely busy helping others,

01:38:31.992 --> 01:38:35.241
at every point. To be helpful.

01:38:36.199 --> 01:38:39.825
You know Ravi Shankar's Guru was a very great,

01:38:40.825 --> 01:38:45.867
a very great man, a realized soul. He was a great person.

01:38:45.867 --> 01:38:47.366
So he knew so many things.

01:38:47.950 --> 01:38:53.200
And one day I was there, in the night you see, there was a doctor,

01:38:53.241 --> 01:38:57.867
we were his guests in a way, for dinner we had gone there.

01:38:58.199 --> 01:38:59.909
In the night the call came that,

01:38:59.950 --> 01:39:02.199
"I need you very much" to the doctor.

01:39:02.199 --> 01:39:03.700
The doctor said, "Now I'm tired".

01:39:03.700 --> 01:39:06.034
He was another very giving person, no doubt.

01:39:06.034 --> 01:39:08.283
He said, "Oh you must come, I have a big problem.

01:39:08.283 --> 01:39:12.117
See I saw a little baby."

01:39:12.159 --> 01:39:14.825
He said, "What baby have you found ?"

01:39:14.867 --> 01:39:17.117
He said, "its a baby," he was an old man,

01:39:17.159 --> 01:39:22.783
he said, "I found a baby of a deer which is suffering now,

01:39:22.783 --> 01:39:26.159
and the mother is dead and nobody is to look after it."

01:39:26.159 --> 01:39:30.200
So I said "Alright I'll also come with you",

01:39:30.241 --> 01:39:33.533
because I knew I will touch the baby. I went with him.

01:39:33.575 --> 01:39:41.366
So, he was sitting with the little thing near his heart.

01:39:41.408 --> 01:39:44.450
So the doctor said, "What are you doing ?"

01:39:44.491 --> 01:39:48.075
He said, "I'm trying to give him my life if possible,

01:39:48.075 --> 01:39:51.617
so that when you come at least you find him alive".

01:39:51.658 --> 01:39:53.992
Just like this, just love.

01:39:53.992 --> 01:39:59.283
So he took out the thing - doctor - his coat and all that,

01:39:59.325 --> 01:40:01.325
and he said, "alright put it down".

01:40:01.366 --> 01:40:03.533
He put it down very cautiously.

01:40:03.575 --> 01:40:05.283
I mean he was a realized soul, no doubt.

01:40:05.283 --> 01:40:09.366
I put my hand on the thing and it came to life,

01:40:09.408 --> 01:40:11.992
and it started, alright, he was very happy.

01:40:12.034 --> 01:40:16.533
He said, "You are a Devi, you are a Goddess, I can tell you.

01:40:16.575 --> 01:40:18.617
But one bad thing you have done." I said "What ? "

01:40:18.658 --> 01:40:22.159
You are married." I said, "But Devis must marry, also."

01:40:22.199 --> 01:40:25.075
He said, "No, supposing you have married a miserly man,

01:40:25.075 --> 01:40:26.617
then what will happen to you ?"

01:40:26.658 --> 01:40:29.408
I said, "I will see to it that, I don't marry a miserly man.

01:40:31.450 --> 01:40:34.575
That would be the greatest curse."

01:40:34.617 --> 01:40:37.117
He said, "I had the same type of a wife who was miserly,

01:40:37.159 --> 01:40:39.825
and I got fed up with her for her miserliness."

01:40:40.783 --> 01:40:44.325
So that is what it is : miserliness should be hated,

01:40:44.366 --> 01:40:50.867
absolutely to be hated, absolutely to be the worst of all.

01:40:50.867 --> 01:40:54.325
It's like leprosy for Sahaja Yogis. Miserliness.

01:40:54.325 --> 01:40:56.575
It's saving saving pounds, you know.

01:40:59.491 --> 01:41:01.909
That must go away from your mind,

01:41:04.241 --> 01:41:09.825
Miserliness to yourself is good, miserliness to others is bad.

01:41:09.867 --> 01:41:12.325
Gregoire told me a shocking thing.

01:41:12.366 --> 01:41:14.199
He said, "this is our culture."

01:41:14.200 --> 01:41:16.199
I said "Your culture ! what is it ?"

01:41:16.658 --> 01:41:20.283
You see, he said that "if we go in a hotel, and if somebody is paying,

01:41:20.325 --> 01:41:22.075
we start looking this side and that."

01:41:22.117 --> 01:41:24.992
I said, "Really !". He said, that is very common.

01:41:30.575 --> 01:41:32.742
I just cannot believe it ! This is culture!

01:41:32.783 --> 01:41:35.783
It is the opposite of culture. Whatever you may call it,

01:41:35.825 --> 01:41:39.200
it's not culture at all. Culture would be to come forward,

01:41:39.241 --> 01:41:42.992
"Alright I'll pay". But Americans are even worse, they'll say,

01:41:43.034 --> 01:41:45.658
"I paid for you yesterday, you pay today for me."

01:41:47.909 --> 01:41:51.283
It's absolutely disgraceful miserliness.

01:41:52.034 --> 01:41:55.533
But this is gracious; you see when somebody is paying,

01:41:55.533 --> 01:41:58.325
you look on the other side. It may be gracious, I don't know,

01:41:59.742 --> 01:42:04.241
whatever it is, it's just the same ; filth I tell you.

01:42:04.283 --> 01:42:07.450
So compassion ; compassion at any point.

01:42:07.450 --> 01:42:09.867
You may have to work till 2 o'clock, you may .

01:42:09.909 --> 01:42:11.783
have to work at 4 o'clock, doesn't matter.

01:42:11.825 --> 01:42:13.867
You have to work, you have to work, you have to work;

01:42:13.909 --> 01:42:17.159
because compassion itself is joy giving,

01:42:17.159 --> 01:42:22.283
because your Spirit is the Ocean of Compassion.

01:42:22.283 --> 01:42:28.909
There is no other way, there is no other way

01:42:28.909 --> 01:42:33.199
to enjoy your Spirit but to Give, to Give, to Give.

01:42:33.200 --> 01:42:35.742
Doesn't matter if you have not eaten your food, doesn't matter.

01:42:35.783 --> 01:42:39.117
Nothing matters.

01:42:40.617 --> 01:42:46.159
Many a times a you know that I don't have food for 24 hours sometimes,

01:42:46.199 --> 01:42:47.950
still I am giving.

01:42:47.992 --> 01:42:50.742
Its not necessary for this body to eat,

01:42:50.783 --> 01:42:55.283
the food of this body is compassion. That nourishes.

01:42:57.533 --> 01:43:00.408
So you have to be miserly towards yourself,

01:43:00.450 --> 01:43:02.283
but you must have compassion.

01:43:03.825 --> 01:43:06.450
Heart, open your heart.

01:43:07.199 --> 01:43:11.742
Open your heart first of all, for thankfulness.

01:43:15.867 --> 01:43:19.658
This is the other quality one should have.

01:43:19.700 --> 01:43:23.575
It's a higher quality I should say, of thankfulness to God.

01:43:23.617 --> 01:43:26.658
He has given you realization. He has given you this body.

01:43:26.700 --> 01:43:28.742
Do you realize that this body,

01:43:28.783 --> 01:43:30.450
human body He has given to you.

01:43:30.617 --> 01:43:32.992
He has given you everything. Count your blessings.

01:43:34.034 --> 01:43:37.950
Even to have the morning, to enjoy it as a human being.

01:43:39.199 --> 01:43:42.992
You are not in any bandhan, you are not in any pasha,

01:43:43.034 --> 01:43:45.283
you are not pashus, you are not animals.

01:43:45.325 --> 01:43:46.950
Animals are pashus.

01:43:46.950 --> 01:43:49.200
You are free people, God has given you freedom.

01:43:50.159 --> 01:43:56.533
And he has given you His realization. Sense of thankfulness.

01:43:56.533 --> 01:44:00.075
But our language is such, "thank you, thank you, thank you," finished.

01:44:00.117 --> 01:44:03.700
It is only in the lips, it finishes; lipservice.

01:44:04.366 --> 01:44:11.117
From your heart thank Him, from your heart.

01:44:11.159 --> 01:44:15.533
Not outside just go to church, "thank you. God very much,"

01:44:15.575 --> 01:44:17.825
alright done, finished.

01:44:21.159 --> 01:44:32.159
It's to thank Him from your heart, write praise. Praise.

01:44:32.199 --> 01:44:41.283
Sing praise, "glory to God." to the great who has created us.

01:44:41.950 --> 01:44:45.533
Your disciples are sitting and every moment

01:44:45.533 --> 01:44:49.408
when you are talking you are thinking about Mother or about God.

01:44:49.450 --> 01:44:57.450
You'll be amazed! It's only possible if you have sensitivity,

01:44:58.909 --> 01:45:07.366
if you have memory. The greatest miracle of this world

01:45:07.408 --> 01:45:11.700
is that everybody has to die and nobody remembers it.

01:45:12.533 --> 01:45:16.199
But another one, is that everybody is blessed by God

01:45:16.199 --> 01:45:18.200
but nobody knows it.

01:45:18.241 --> 01:45:22.783
But you are so specially blessed.

01:45:28.075 --> 01:45:31.034
So what you should do ?

01:45:32.200 --> 01:45:40.075
Be in joy, be grateful, so that bliss comes to you.

01:45:41.825 --> 01:45:45.533
Without thankfulness nothing is going to work out.

01:45:45.575 --> 01:45:48.617
Thankful heart.

01:45:48.658 --> 01:45:53.575
You need a heart that is thankful to God so that he gives you.

01:45:53.617 --> 01:45:56.700
When you give others he will definitely give.

01:45:56.742 --> 01:45:58.950
But don't think it is your own.

01:46:01.783 --> 01:46:05.909
You are giving what God has given you.

01:46:07.241 --> 01:46:13.283
So today I have told you 8-fold movement.

01:46:13.283 --> 01:46:17.533
So you have become half moon, only in mind.

01:46:18.825 --> 01:46:25.617
And the other half, keep it for the next 'Guru Purnima'. Alright ?

01:46:25.658 --> 01:46:28.909
MAY GOD BLESS YOU
