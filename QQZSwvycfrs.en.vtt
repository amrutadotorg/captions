Public Program, day 1 Jehangir Hall, Mumbai 23-03-1973

00:00:03.343 --> 00:00:13.038
For example, if you discuss with a medical doctor,

00:00:13.416 --> 00:00:18.217
he will not be able to tell you what is a libido,

00:00:18.242 --> 00:00:25.286
which is the basis of many psychological findings.

00:00:26.766 --> 00:00:29.619
If you ask the psychologist,

00:00:29.644 --> 00:00:32.370
he may not be able to tell you

00:00:32.395 --> 00:00:36.294
what are the symptoms of the sympathetic

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:39.136
and the parasympathetic nervous system.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:56.124
Then, “yogashastri” (yoga experts) are regarded as something
out of place.

00:01:01.044 --> 00:01:04.092
Perhaps we have never realised

00:01:04.116 --> 00:01:08.909
that all these knowledge springs from one source,

00:01:08.934 --> 00:01:12.199
that is awareness.

00:01:13.205 --> 00:01:17.630
One source is giving all these flowers

00:01:17.833 --> 00:01:21.365
and still, we are separated.

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.769
And we are fighting with each other,

00:01:23.794 --> 00:01:27.776
not knowing that this is one source

00:01:27.801 --> 00:01:31.405
that has blossomed into so many flowers.

00:01:35.576 --> 00:01:41.222
This disintegration leads us to confusion.

00:01:41.252 --> 00:01:49.707
And Kaliyuga, this modern age is

00:01:50.161 --> 00:01:52.916
known for its confusion.

00:01:53.136 --> 00:02:00.273
The religion, the dharma and the adharma, both are confused.

00:02:02.005 --> 00:02:11.179
Right and wrong is a confused subject.

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:20.831
Divine and satanic are confused.

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:23.608
Keeping all things in view,

00:02:23.633 --> 00:02:28.869
we have to be very open-minded, like a scientist.

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:38.700
And find out how the Divine is working within us.

00:02:47.533 --> 00:02:53.490
Some biologists who have been working on the subject of life,

00:02:55.576 --> 00:03:02.669
have brought about a very good thesis

00:03:05.953 --> 00:03:14.200
about the life that was created in such a short time.

00:03:15.913 --> 00:03:21.051
According to those biologists,

00:03:22.941 --> 00:03:32.034
the time taken for a human life to evolve

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:42.946
from the time when the earth seceded from the sun,

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.528
is too short to even create a life.

00:03:49.046 --> 00:03:56.565
They have given an explanation

00:03:56.618 --> 00:04:01.275
that if you apply the law of chance,

00:04:01.363 --> 00:04:03.997
this is an impossibility.

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.715
Let us see what is the law of chance?

00:04:08.433 --> 00:04:14.775
The law of chance can be understood by a simple analogy.

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.041
Supposing there are fifty red marbles

00:04:19.066 --> 00:04:21.890
and fifty black marbles.

00:04:22.513 --> 00:04:25.402
And they are put in a jar

00:04:25.427 --> 00:04:31.326
and allowed to shake through some mechanical means,

00:04:32.017 --> 00:04:34.976
then you find they all get mixed up.

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:37.857
This is the chaos.

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:42.869
And, when you try to bring them back

00:04:42.964 --> 00:04:46.378
to their original position,

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:50.916
you find that it takes

00:04:50.941 --> 00:04:57.312
a certain number of shaking which is the minimum required.

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.133
Please try to understand this analogy.

00:05:01.158 --> 00:05:03.488
It is a very simple analogy.

00:05:03.882 --> 00:05:09.464
There is a jar with fifty white or black

00:05:09.502 --> 00:05:11.945
and red pebbles

00:05:13.565 --> 00:05:19.242
or you can call it small, round,

00:05:19.923 --> 00:05:23.410
these children play with that; that sort of thing.

00:05:23.742 --> 00:05:25.716
And you shake it.

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:31.970
When you start shaking it, they become all mixed up.

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:42.832
So, from the chaos to the organised life, it is like a cell.

00:05:43.224 --> 00:05:49.430
Amoeba is an organised life, compared to matter.

00:05:49.543 --> 00:05:52.289
Even the molecules are organised,

00:05:52.314 --> 00:05:54.761
even the atoms are organised,

00:05:54.786 --> 00:06:01.279
but they do not have the will to organise themselves.

00:06:02.586 --> 00:06:05.566
Or will to protect themselves.

00:06:05.993 --> 00:06:09.721
So to get to this organism

00:06:10.601 --> 00:06:19.127
which is life itself should have normally taken much more years

00:06:19.152 --> 00:06:24.980
than these two hundred billion years

00:06:25.363 --> 00:06:27.916
which is a very short time.

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:32.072
According to them, the time taken is say,

00:06:32.097 --> 00:06:35.736
‘n’ raised to the power ‘xyz’.

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:39.836
It is a mathematical thing; I don’t want to go into that.

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:44.880
Now the time that is taken is only ‘n’;

00:06:44.905 --> 00:06:47.841
leave alone raised to the power of anything.

00:06:48.022 --> 00:06:53.398
In that short time, to evolve such a complex structure

00:06:55.137 --> 00:06:59.767
like a human being by chance is an impossibility.

00:06:59.792 --> 00:07:02.334
Is absolutely acceptable.

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:10.029
But when you see those pebbles,

00:07:10.594 --> 00:07:19.112
you can construct them in the proper way if there is a juggler.

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:24.760
If somebody who knows how to push

00:07:25.545 --> 00:07:30.389
the red ones to the red side and the black ones to the black side,

00:07:31.612 --> 00:07:34.232
you can manage that.

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:39.960
This indicates that there is a juggler;

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:43.508
totally conscious and aware,

00:07:43.532 --> 00:07:46.910
with cosmic understanding and power,

00:07:46.935 --> 00:07:51.127
who is managing the show in such a short time.

00:07:53.910 --> 00:08:05.526
For the scientist, it is only to point out that there is some juggler.

00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:08.912
They cannot explain any further.

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:19.710
Now let us see what the psychologists have to say on this subject.

00:08:21.287 --> 00:08:28.650
The psychologists believe and have accepted in toto.

00:08:32.621 --> 00:08:38.442
The fact that there is a universal being within ourselves,

00:08:38.766 --> 00:08:41.864
without, they have not yet accepted.

00:08:42.827 --> 00:08:48.817
But within ourselves  who binds us together,

00:08:49.587 --> 00:08:53.099
because when we are asleep

00:08:53.124 --> 00:08:57.672
and when we submerge ourselves into our subconscious mind,

00:08:58.139 --> 00:09:03.595
we find certain symbols appearing in our dream.

00:09:03.801 --> 00:09:06.167
There is a theory

00:09:06.218 --> 00:09:10.059
forwarded by many psychologists and supported by them;

00:09:10.084 --> 00:09:12.729
that these symbols appear

00:09:12.754 --> 00:09:19.175
universally the same in everything.

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:30.180
For example, if this Universal Unconscious wants to

00:09:30.205 --> 00:09:33.109
suggest that you are going to be murdered,

00:09:33.134 --> 00:09:39.005
or there is a danger to you through some violence,

00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:41.370
or instrument of violence.

00:09:41.395 --> 00:09:48.013
You see a triangular, elongated symbol.

00:09:48.038 --> 00:09:51.041
Whether you are an Indian, whether you are an American,

00:09:51.066 --> 00:09:55.128
whether you are a Japanese or a Russian, makes no difference to the symbol.

00:09:55.500 --> 00:10:01.903
That means there is a Being

00:10:01.928 --> 00:10:05.806
which is  universally working these symbols.

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:16.330
There is another thing which many psychologists support,

00:10:17.416 --> 00:10:28.192
that the Unconscious is all the time trying to keep us on the right track.

00:10:28.217 --> 00:10:30.845
It gives us a balance.

00:10:33.386 --> 00:10:41.487
For example, I will quote Jung, j-u-n-g,

00:10:41.946 --> 00:10:46.264
who has given two examples of the balance

00:10:46.296 --> 00:10:51.003
that the Unconscious has suggested in faithed.

00:10:54.306 --> 00:11:00.786
One gentleman came to him and told him that,

00:11:00.811 --> 00:11:03.814
“I just dream.

00:11:04.769 --> 00:11:08.199
And in my dream, invariably,  I see

00:11:08.224 --> 00:11:14.145
that I am placed before my son, who is a king.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.635
Sometimes I find I have lost my way.

00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:19.981
Sometimes I can’t catch a train.

00:11:20.006 --> 00:11:23.624
sometimes I do all kinds of tragic things in my dream

00:11:23.649 --> 00:11:28.495
and ultimately I find I am landed before my son

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:32.553
who is sitting on a throne, like a king”.

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:39.154
So, Mr Jung asked him,

00:11:39.179 --> 00:11:42.712
“What are your relations with your son?”.

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:46.577
This gentleman said,

00:11:46.602 --> 00:11:49.471
“You see, he is a son from my first wife,

00:11:49.496 --> 00:11:52.811
and my second wife is not very happy with him.

00:11:52.836 --> 00:11:54.702
So I keep him out.

00:11:54.727 --> 00:12:00.381
But still, I should say I have done no justice to him as a father”.

00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:05.033
Mr Jung said, “The Unconscious is teaching you

00:12:05.058 --> 00:12:08.733
that you respect him because he is a king”.

00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:16.764
One day such a man will repent

00:12:16.789 --> 00:12:21.822
in  heart for treating his own son like that,

00:12:21.847 --> 00:12:27.446
who depends on his father for all the love and protection.

00:12:28.224 --> 00:12:31.611
Another case is that of a girl

00:12:31.636 --> 00:12:35.312
who came to him and told him that, “I dream

00:12:35.337 --> 00:12:38.961
that my mother is a witch.

00:12:39.525 --> 00:12:42.390
it is so common that now I am

00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:44.471
And it is so common that now I am fed up of that dream.

00:12:44.496 --> 00:12:47.246
And I don’t want to accept

00:12:47.269 --> 00:12:51.252
such a horrible thing about my mother”.

00:12:52.712 --> 00:12:58.665
So he asked her, “How are you placed with your mother?

00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:00.605
Are you happy with her?”.

00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:06.124
She said, “I am an only child  born after a long time.

00:13:06.149 --> 00:13:08.212
I am very much pampered by her.

00:13:08.332 --> 00:13:11.285
And she allows me to do whatever I like.

00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:13.373
She doesn’t say anything to me.

00:13:13.398 --> 00:13:16.835
She says, ‘I just want you to be happy and do whatever you feel.

00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:18.512
I have nothing to say about it.

00:13:18.537 --> 00:13:21.015
Sometimes I am even confused.

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:27.274
She gives me no guidance and takes no responsibility  as guiding me.

00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:32.185
Neither she discuss any one of her experiences with me.

00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:39.011
In the result, I have become a spoiled person.

00:13:39.036 --> 00:13:41.204
I have become a very fussy person

00:13:41.229 --> 00:13:45.479
and I have become intolerably hot-tempered”.

00:13:47.479 --> 00:13:55.015
So the deduction was that the Unconscious is giving you the suggestion

00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:57.528
that, “My child, be careful.

00:13:57.542 --> 00:13:59.555
You will become a witch.

00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:02.361
If you listen to this witch”.

00:14:04.991 --> 00:14:09.791
Now, by saying there is a universal Being,

00:14:09.816 --> 00:14:12.048
there is a universal consciousness,

00:14:12.073 --> 00:14:15.231
an awareness that is working in us;

00:14:15.256 --> 00:14:17.875
you are just giving a name to something.

00:14:18.173 --> 00:14:20.295
It doesn’t explain.

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:23.308
It's like saying that

00:14:26.101 --> 00:14:29.269
there is a juggler doing the job

00:14:29.294 --> 00:14:33.506
or like saying there is a Universal Being who is looking after you

00:14:33.531 --> 00:14:36.235
and guiding you and giving you the balance.

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:41.289
They call it the “intuition drive” and all the names.

00:14:44.106 --> 00:14:48.060
Now let us see the medical sciences; what they have to say.

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:54.330
When you go to a medical man

00:14:54.990 --> 00:15:00.309
and ask him a simple question that,   “Please let me know

00:15:03.641 --> 00:15:07.250
what is making my heart pulsate?

00:15:07.774 --> 00:15:10.587
What is controlling my digestion?

00:15:10.819 --> 00:15:14.180
What is looking after my respiration?”.

00:15:14.516 --> 00:15:17.416
He will just say that “There is a system known as

00:15:17.417 --> 00:15:19.352
the autonomous nervous system

00:15:19.377 --> 00:15:22.745
which is responsible for this regulation”.

00:15:22.770 --> 00:15:29.046
This is another name given to the same Universal Divine.

00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:33.040
This is not to decry them at all

00:15:33.065 --> 00:15:38.505
nor to in any way belittle their effort of finding.

00:15:38.530 --> 00:15:41.366
On the contrary, whatever they have found out,

00:15:41.391 --> 00:15:46.446
they have reached a place where now they have to say

00:15:46.471 --> 00:15:51.584
that there is something that is to be still bridged.

00:15:51.609 --> 00:15:55.055
That is still to be understood.

00:15:56.277 --> 00:15:59.143
There are two autonomous nervous systems in our body.

00:15:59.168 --> 00:16:03.863
One is the parasympathetic and another is the sympathetic nervous system.

00:16:04.390 --> 00:16:08.990
Now the sympathetic nervous system is again divided into the right and left side

00:16:09.015 --> 00:16:13.513
and the parasympathetic nervous system is in the centre.

00:16:14.795 --> 00:16:18.122
The person who is a right-hander has his

00:16:18.205 --> 00:16:21.223
left side sympathetic working while the left-hander

00:16:21.255 --> 00:16:24.136
has his left (should be right) side sympathetic working.

00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:28.598
Now one remains absolutely quiet.

00:16:29.518 --> 00:16:33.540
Now both these sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems

00:16:33.565 --> 00:16:38.778
are responsible, one for activity, another for inactivity.

00:16:38.950 --> 00:16:41.850
One constricts, another relaxes.

00:16:41.875 --> 00:16:47.259
One puts you to tension, another one makes you absolutely restful.

00:16:47.469 --> 00:16:51.503
The sympathetic nervous system has placed a very great,

00:16:51.528 --> 00:16:54.929
difficult problem for the doctors now.

00:16:54.954 --> 00:17:00.173
With the over-activity of the sympathetic nervous system,

00:17:01.277 --> 00:17:05.064
you get the disease known as cancer.

00:17:05.656 --> 00:17:09.553
When there is an irritation in the body

00:17:10.743 --> 00:17:15.148
and when some sort of protection is needed,

00:17:15.173 --> 00:17:25.395
that part starts getting more active and the cell starts multiplying.

00:17:26.430 --> 00:17:33.351
The sympathetic nervous system works to protect that part.

00:17:33.518 --> 00:17:37.749
But ultimately results in the malignancy that is the

00:17:37.929 --> 00:17:41.713
more activity of the cell in that part.

00:17:41.923 --> 00:17:45.911
This is a simple thing that is known as cancer.

00:17:46.606 --> 00:17:49.945
The advent of cancer in the kaliyuga

00:17:49.970 --> 00:17:53.796
is now a challenge to all the scientists of the world.

00:17:53.821 --> 00:17:59.730
For nobody can escape it if they do not now realise

00:17:59.755 --> 00:18:03.898
that’s not the activity of man

00:18:03.923 --> 00:18:08.707
that is going to give him salvation – but the inactive.

00:18:13.010 --> 00:18:16.086
But for parasympathetic they would immediately say

00:18:16.111 --> 00:18:21.065
that it is not humanly possible to control the parasympathetic.

00:18:21.656 --> 00:18:26.387
For example, you can, by working harder or running more,

00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:30.367
you can make your heart pulsate more;

00:18:30.392 --> 00:18:33.147
but you cannot relax your heart.

00:18:33.269 --> 00:18:35.409
That is not in your hands.

00:18:35.695 --> 00:18:38.714
They say there is another force that is working

00:18:38.739 --> 00:18:42.505
which looks after the relaxation of the heart.

00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:47.950
The yogashastra which has,

00:18:47.975 --> 00:18:51.517
for so many years been describing

00:18:52.433 --> 00:18:58.043
the Kundalini is  nothing but the simple parasympathetic nervous system.

00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:02.939
The parasympathetic nervous system is the gross expression

00:19:02.964 --> 00:19:06.829
of that system which is in the spinal cord.

00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:12.729
In the spinal cord, we call it the Kundalini and the chakras.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.104
The centres that guide;

00:19:15.129 --> 00:19:20.307
the centres and plexuses outside are known as the chakras.

00:19:21.928 --> 00:19:26.000
For example, your hand has got a centre in the head.

00:19:26.025 --> 00:19:30.115
In the same way, these plexuses which are in our being,

00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:35.241
which are namely, down below you can start, the pelvic plexus.

00:19:35.399 --> 00:19:37.744
Then you have got the aortic plexus,

00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:40.400
then you have got the solar plexus,

00:19:40.873 --> 00:19:43.677
then you have got the cardiac plexus.

00:19:44.953 --> 00:19:47.402
Then you have got,

00:19:52.056 --> 00:19:54.235
I have forgotten the English name  that

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:58.592
but it is what we call the swadhishthana chakra here. (Vishuddi)

00:19:58.617 --> 00:20:03.255
Then we have got here, the Agyna chakra here we call it.

00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:07.061
But this one though we call it the Agyna chakra in yogashastra;

00:20:07.086 --> 00:20:12.311
in the medical science, there is no name as Agyna chakra.

00:20:12.336 --> 00:20:16.320
But they accept that there can be a “third eye”.

00:20:16.345 --> 00:20:18.862
Now this is something very hypothetical

00:20:18.887 --> 00:20:21.630
as far as medical science is concerned.

00:20:23.824 --> 00:20:27.450
So the Agnya chakra which is actually in the center

00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:31.294
of the optic chiasma, in the center of the brain

00:20:31.534 --> 00:20:34.611
where both the optic nerves cross

00:20:34.924 --> 00:20:39.980
is, according to the yogashastra is the Agyna chakra.

00:20:40.005 --> 00:20:42.287
It is placed there.

00:20:42.670 --> 00:20:46.661
And the Sahasrara , when you open out

00:20:46.686 --> 00:20:50.230
the brain, you will find

00:20:50.405 --> 00:20:57.869
that there are petal-like designs on the brain.

00:20:57.894 --> 00:20:59.980
If you vertically cut it

00:21:00.011 --> 00:21:04.431
you will find that there are petals in petals.

00:21:04.456 --> 00:21:08.355
And these designs are, according to medical sciences,

00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:10.768
are nine hundred and eighty-two.

00:21:10.793 --> 00:21:16.600
While according to the yogashastras, they are one thousand.

00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:26.888
Now, My own knowledge is not scientific.

00:21:26.913 --> 00:21:29.790
I am very sorry to say that.

00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:34.393
Mind is a subjective knowledge.

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:37.361
Scientific knowledge is objective.

00:21:37.759 --> 00:21:41.425
I have seen all these chakras within Myself.

00:21:41.495 --> 00:21:44.083
And you also can see all of them

00:21:44.108 --> 00:21:48.618
if you get realisation according to My Sahaja Yoga.

00:21:49.135 --> 00:21:51.480
And if you go deeper

00:21:51.505 --> 00:21:54.318
into your being, you can see all of them.

00:21:54.343 --> 00:21:56.671
Because Self-realisation means,

00:21:56.696 --> 00:22:00.453
you should know yourself and the power that is guiding you.

00:22:02.336 --> 00:22:07.651
The last Sahasrara is the one-thousand petalled .

00:22:07.789 --> 00:22:15.405
I have seen as flames, thousands of flames clustered together.

00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:20.826
In the Bible, there is a beautiful sentence,

00:22:20.931 --> 00:22:24.947
 “I will appear before you like the tons of flame”.

00:22:24.972 --> 00:22:29.513
And actually like the tons of flames you see that.

00:22:30.592 --> 00:22:33.552
Whether you read the Bible or Koran,

00:22:33.577 --> 00:22:39.386
you will find many instances, many sentences by which

00:22:39.411 --> 00:22:44.037
you can see that there is an integration of the Kundalini

00:22:44.141 --> 00:22:47.316
in all of them – and it is described.

00:22:47.529 --> 00:22:52.699
The only trouble is, that the Bible was written

00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:58.163
by many people who were inspired in different parts of the country

00:22:58.188 --> 00:23:01.302
and they also saw part by part.

00:23:01.389 --> 00:23:09.338
And because of this kind of separate experiences,

00:23:09.798 --> 00:23:13.385
the knowledge that is in the Bible is scattered.

00:23:13.572 --> 00:23:18.398
But if somebody can sit down and try to find out,

00:23:18.551 --> 00:23:25.582
you can find the complete description of the Kundalini in the Bible.

00:23:29.215 --> 00:23:37.105
So scientifically, when you talk about it, it is still of this.

00:23:38.189 --> 00:23:41.830
Now scientifically, I can prove

00:23:41.855 --> 00:23:45.648
that this loudspeaker works in such and such way,

00:23:45.673 --> 00:23:49.538
that it carries the sound waves to you.

00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:57.619
But when I have to deal with life,

00:23:59.471 --> 00:24:06.859
you have to come to the Divine, to the Divine Love.

00:24:09.915 --> 00:24:14.435
Just think, that man despite all his scientific

00:24:15.033 --> 00:24:19.346
findings has not been able to create life.

00:24:20.871 --> 00:24:28.623
We cannot create one plant out of a seed.

00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:35.595
Why?

00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:41.032
While somebody is doing that, crores and crores of these,

00:24:41.346 --> 00:24:45.653
so many wonderful miracles

00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:50.974
Every moment and we have taken them for granted.

00:24:51.181 --> 00:24:57.828
Do we ever think how a flower suddenly becomes a fruit?

00:25:00.553 --> 00:25:04.680
If we look at a flower scientifically, we can say that there is pollen,

00:25:04.705 --> 00:25:08.275
and there is a pollen jar and they mix it up and this happens.

00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:09.635
But how?

00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:10.895
Why?

00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:13.254
Who works it out?

00:25:13.973 --> 00:25:16.553
What is the dominating force that works out?

00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:19.720
Can you do that if you mix up pollen with pollen work

00:25:19.745 --> 00:25:20.874
can you do (it) that way? You cannot.

00:25:20.899 --> 00:25:22.047
You cannot.

00:25:22.594 --> 00:25:25.202
So there is some superhuman being,

00:25:25.227 --> 00:25:28.004
somebody who is much more powerful than you,

00:25:28.029 --> 00:25:31.381
who is doing these things just like a play.

00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:36.570
So when you come to Divine Love,

00:25:36.595 --> 00:25:38.979
you know that it is just a play.

00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:43.708
Tomorrow I will be explaining to you

00:25:43.733 --> 00:25:47.108
how My Sahaja Yoga works through Divine Love.

00:25:47.133 --> 00:25:49.794
And how it is effortless.

00:25:50.329 --> 00:25:53.144
But when we cannot even take out

00:25:53.169 --> 00:25:55.785
one plant out of a seed,

00:25:55.810 --> 00:25:58.794
let us forget that we have done great work.

00:26:00.095 --> 00:26:03.633
We are unnecessarily carrying the load

00:26:08.389 --> 00:26:12.586
of doing something that is absolutely dead.

00:26:12.786 --> 00:26:17.864
If we have some dead stone and we create

00:26:17.889 --> 00:26:20.780
a beautiful building like this

00:26:20.805 --> 00:26:23.963
and we think we have done a great job.

00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:30.274
Science can deal with the dead

00:26:30.338 --> 00:26:33.118
but not with the living.

00:26:33.555 --> 00:26:40.997
When they come to living sciences like biology,

00:26:41.214 --> 00:26:45.359
medical science and psychology,

00:26:45.384 --> 00:26:48.695
you know what happens; they stop at a point.

00:26:49.399 --> 00:26:52.413
With physics, you can go on explaining things,

00:26:52.438 --> 00:26:56.141
but with life, it is not possible.

00:26:56.607 --> 00:27:01.113
Even with physics, you cannot explain beyond a point.

00:27:01.668 --> 00:27:05.495
They will say there is gravity which is attracting the Earth.

00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:07.615
But who has brought this gravity?

00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:09.363
From where it has come?

00:27:09.388 --> 00:27:13.155
If there was no gravity, we would not have been here.

00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:20.431
If the ocean, the Atlantic Ocean or Pacific ocean,

00:27:20.456 --> 00:27:25.810
was slightly deeper than what it is; there would have been no life.

00:27:26.385 --> 00:27:30.133
There are so many points that scientists can quote

00:27:30.158 --> 00:27:34.236
which show that the whole creation is very, very balanced

00:27:34.261 --> 00:27:36.748
and beautifully created.

00:27:38.006 --> 00:27:41.475
But I know the question that is hovering in your mind,

00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:44.015
"Then why all this misery?

00:27:44.316 --> 00:27:49.492
Only the science can eradicate the misery”.

00:27:49.627 --> 00:27:52.540
It can, of course, partially.

00:27:52.565 --> 00:27:56.195
That is physical. Very partially.

00:27:56.220 --> 00:27:58.863
But I have seen  many physically fit people.

00:27:58.888 --> 00:28:00.655
They are very miserable.

00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:03.295
Some of the pehlwans, you see, they come to Me

00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:06.770
and tell Me, “Mataji, give us some peace of mind.

00:28:06.919 --> 00:28:09.626
We want some joy within ourselves”.

00:28:09.835 --> 00:28:13.985
So, that is what science has done,

00:28:14.010 --> 00:28:16.365
that physically they have helped.

00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:20.723
Mentally also, some psychologists definitely have helped also.

00:28:20.807 --> 00:28:22.490
You cannot deny that.

00:28:22.515 --> 00:28:28.384
But what do they help is just to keep you sane for a while.

00:28:30.839 --> 00:28:33.171
It's not only sanity;

00:28:33.251 --> 00:28:35.335
it is much more than that.

00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:38.009
Much more dynamics that is working

00:28:38.034 --> 00:28:40.795
the whole plan of this universe.

00:28:40.820 --> 00:28:44.443
And this is the place we have reached now.

00:28:44.468 --> 00:28:46.222
Which I call the modern times.

00:28:46.247 --> 00:28:49.310
Which is the most fitted for the jumping

00:28:49.335 --> 00:28:53.595
of the human beings to the other side of evolution.

00:28:53.895 --> 00:28:56.208
This is the blossom time for us.

00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:58.217
Of course when there is the blossom time,

00:28:58.242 --> 00:29:02.064
you find also the serpents hovering around.

00:29:02.970 --> 00:29:07.170
So the equal and opposite forces are at work.

00:29:07.195 --> 00:29:10.100
And scientists are the first who will help

00:29:10.125 --> 00:29:13.658
to build up the positivity in this respect,

00:29:13.683 --> 00:29:15.815
of that I am very sure.

00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:18.912
Because in America when I talk to the doctors

00:29:18.937 --> 00:29:22.046
and the neurologists, some of them visited this place.

00:29:22.071 --> 00:29:25.445
And they going to organise a conference of the doctors.

00:29:25.470 --> 00:29:29.669
I was amazed by the way they opened their mind to Mine.

00:29:30.402 --> 00:29:31.402
You see,

00:29:32.821 --> 00:29:35.013
Of course, in America, there is a funny law

00:29:35.038 --> 00:29:36.795
that you cannot cure anyone.

00:29:36.820 --> 00:29:39.675
If you cure, you will be put behind the bars

00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:41.247
if you are not a doctor.

00:29:42.773 --> 00:29:44.236
But I do not know any cure.

00:29:44.261 --> 00:29:47.453
I just ask people to put their hands towards Me.

00:29:47.647 --> 00:29:52.506
Scientifically they cannot prove that I have done any cure.

00:29:52.531 --> 00:29:55.171
Except that when they see the blood count

00:29:55.196 --> 00:29:57.102
and when they see the X-ray,

00:29:57.127 --> 00:29:59.867
they know that the cancer is cured.

00:30:00.916 --> 00:30:03.403
otherwise, they cannot catch Me.

00:30:03.493 --> 00:30:06.406
Still I didn't want to have that treatment,

00:30:06.495 --> 00:30:10.206
because I did not have that much foreign exchange.

00:30:13.903 --> 00:30:16.956
But I feel that knowledge will come one day

00:30:16.981 --> 00:30:20.566
maybe from America, reflected back to India.

00:30:20.591 --> 00:30:25.800
If the medical people and the psychologists,

00:30:26.971 --> 00:30:29.337
I have some people who are My disciples

00:30:29.362 --> 00:30:32.614
and My children who have been very much benefitted,

00:30:32.639 --> 00:30:36.569
who are doctors as well as psychiatrists.

00:30:37.723 --> 00:30:44.683
If they could come with a open heart.

00:30:44.708 --> 00:30:46.439
For I am a Mother.

00:30:46.464 --> 00:30:50.303
I am not here to (in) any way decry them or to insult them.

00:30:50.696 --> 00:30:53.986
But to give them the whole, entire knowledge

00:30:54.011 --> 00:30:56.021
that they have been seeking.

00:30:56.609 --> 00:30:59.832
With all My love and dedication.

00:30:59.857 --> 00:31:04.600
If they could gather up that much courage

00:31:04.625 --> 00:31:07.562
and don’t worry about their practice,

00:31:08.623 --> 00:31:11.403
it would  never be haphazard.

00:31:13.583 --> 00:31:15.746
For who creates the wealth?

00:31:15.771 --> 00:31:17.705
Who creates the beauty?

00:31:17.712 --> 00:31:20.563
Who creates everything that is around?

00:31:20.650 --> 00:31:23.436
Is the one who is seeking, then you [UNCLEAR].

00:31:23.825 --> 00:31:26.717
 [UNCLEAR/try] understand

00:31:26.742 --> 00:31:31.752
that these things which are so important  to you scientifically,

00:31:31.777 --> 00:31:34.173
there is a science of economics;

00:31:34.198 --> 00:31:36.208
certain things are very important.

00:31:36.211 --> 00:31:39.468
Your priorities change suddenly.

00:31:40.125 --> 00:31:44.595
Because after all in all these churches,

00:31:44.870 --> 00:31:51.992
the human kind is wandering, working, labouring, just to find joy.

00:31:52.822 --> 00:31:57.180
All this is to have  joy in people’s lives

00:31:57.205 --> 00:31:59.371
and when you get that,

00:32:00.071 --> 00:32:03.579
all artificial things that

00:32:03.604 --> 00:32:06.867
are supposed to make you happy just drop off.

00:32:12.013 --> 00:32:15.653
Tomorrow we are going to have a meditation

00:32:15.707 --> 00:32:18.661
at about eight-thirty sharp.

00:32:19.044 --> 00:32:21.131
I would request you people to come

00:32:21.156 --> 00:32:23.418
and see for yourself because

00:32:23.443 --> 00:32:28.224
I can scientifically show you the breathing of the Kundalini.

00:32:28.892 --> 00:32:33.542
If you get your realisation as some of the doctors in Pune got it.

00:32:33.792 --> 00:32:36.505
I told them that, “Now I will show you the centres

00:32:36.530 --> 00:32:39.238
and chakras about which we have been talking.

00:32:39.332 --> 00:32:41.859
You can come and see them with your own hands”.

00:32:41.884 --> 00:32:43.915
And they were amazed.

00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:47.298
They said, “How could we see that?”.

00:32:47.323 --> 00:32:49.741
I said, “With the vibrations that you have.

00:32:52.551 --> 00:32:57.588
I will request you to come with a open mind

00:32:57.613 --> 00:32:59.936
and see for yourself.

00:33:00.123 --> 00:33:02.445
Don’t depend on the stories of others.

00:33:02.470 --> 00:33:05.408
I don’t want any gurudom here.

00:33:06.069 --> 00:33:09.315
You cannot give Me anything, I can assure you.

00:33:09.615 --> 00:33:12.570
Except that you accept My love

00:33:12.595 --> 00:33:15.725
which is overflowing from My Being.

00:33:18.288 --> 00:33:25.960
Just if you could spare some time and see for yourself,

00:33:27.406 --> 00:33:30.517
the Kundalini, the breathing of the Kundalini

00:33:30.542 --> 00:33:34.700
how it feels and how it works, so beautifully.

00:33:35.521 --> 00:33:40.312
And some of the mistakes committed by very

00:33:45.176 --> 00:33:49.411
unwise psychologists like Freud

00:33:50.583 --> 00:33:55.438
has also been committed by some of the yogashastra people.

00:33:55.820 --> 00:34:02.169
Whatever they  feel in the books may not corrected; true.

00:34:03.476 --> 00:34:08.699
And because of a certain mistakes committed by them,

00:34:09.266 --> 00:34:13.561
the Kundalini itself has created problems for seekers.

00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:17.001
But so far in Bombay,

00:34:17.139 --> 00:34:23.053
at least ten thousand people must have received  Kundalini “jagruti” (awakening).

00:34:23.078 --> 00:34:25.889
But not a single person I have known,

00:34:25.914 --> 00:34:32.874
who has suffered any kind of trouble,

00:34:33.724 --> 00:34:43.563
or any dancing, or becoming nude, or shouting.

00:34:43.588 --> 00:34:48.660
Or any kind of foolish efforts to express,

00:34:48.685 --> 00:34:53.339
advertise that you are awakened .

00:34:53.889 --> 00:34:55.919
Whom are we deceiving?

00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:01.595
When it works, it works silently.

00:35:01.679 --> 00:35:04.745
Automatically within yourself.

00:35:05.346 --> 00:35:09.205
And the greatest scientific proof

00:35:09.230 --> 00:35:12.776
is  that you yourself know that you are realised.

00:35:13.450 --> 00:35:17.215
You yourself feel the vibrations through you and you yourself

00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:20.439
can awaken the Kundalini of others and can

00:35:20.464 --> 00:35:22.663
see and feel the Kundalini of others.

00:35:22.905 --> 00:35:26.247
The Divine has no interest whatsoever

00:35:26.272 --> 00:35:29.537
whether you are a householder or a sanyasi.

00:35:30.263 --> 00:35:32.974
Just think of the divine and it’s work.

00:35:33.644 --> 00:35:36.068
The divine has no interest at all

00:35:36.093 --> 00:35:39.496
that something have something.

00:35:41.286 --> 00:35:45.960
Like they give nowadays [human being] like that.

00:35:46.571 --> 00:35:49.646
[there are two more sentences, which are not clear]

00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:54.242
On this subject also, I am going to speak on Thursday,

00:35:54.267 --> 00:35:59.600
where I will be describing the libido.

00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:04.752
Tomorrow I will be [UNCLEAR] Sahaja Yoga

00:36:04.780 --> 00:36:07.299
where we will be describing the parasympathetic.

00:36:07.398 --> 00:36:09.879
be describing Narasimhapati and Thursday the video will

00:36:09.904 --> 00:36:11.972
And  third day the libido which is on the right-hand side

00:36:11.997 --> 00:36:15.399
of the sympathetic nervous system.

00:36:16.138 --> 00:36:24.578
After that we will have a theoretical session.

00:36:26.190 --> 00:36:30.629
All are cordially invited to come

00:36:30.869 --> 00:36:33.200
and never deceive Me for a mother

00:36:33.225 --> 00:36:35.605
that you have committed any sin.

00:36:35.630 --> 00:36:39.386
It hurts the very soul of My heart

00:36:39.411 --> 00:36:42.914
to know that how can My children sin?

00:36:45.803 --> 00:36:49.182
To a Mother, you are the dearest.

00:36:49.342 --> 00:36:53.180
And you yourself are so beautiful and so great.

00:36:53.480 --> 00:36:58.405
So glorious and so fragrant with love

00:36:58.925 --> 00:37:02.138
that you are not aware.

00:37:02.542 --> 00:37:05.517
Once you are aware of that,

00:37:05.542 --> 00:37:08.861
you will be aware of that [UNCLEAR].

00:37:11.349 --> 00:37:12.769
Thank you very much.

00:37:12.802 --> 00:37:14.890
I really thank you. And I hope you

00:37:14.890 --> 00:37:18.377
will make it convenient to come tomorrow and the day after.
