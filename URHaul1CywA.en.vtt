03:59.547 --> 04:04.626
﻿Adi Shakti Puja, Detachment, Rahuri (India), 11 December 1988.

04:05.347 --> 04:09.151
Puja has to start at the time, when it has to start

04:09.726 --> 04:13.862
I’ve been waiting and waiting and waiting,

04:14.046 --> 04:20.069
then I realised that today is a very good time

04:20.269 --> 04:28.598
according to the calendar; but it is not in the morning,

04:28.799 --> 04:32.198
so it had to be the third day of the moon

04:32.399 --> 04:37.470
and as the moon is changing its phases in the day time,

04:37.671 --> 04:40.269
we had to wait till it started. I think,

04:40.470 --> 04:47.669
all these things have happened, of the theft and everything has happened, perhaps,

04:48.399 --> 04:52.748
to delay the Puja up to the point where it should start.

04:52.952 --> 04:56.127
So in Sahaja Yoga we all go beyond time

04:56.327 --> 04:59.019
and we don't have to worry about the timing;

04:59.219 --> 05:01.723
only when it's a formal function or something,

05:01.923 --> 05:06.371
because the people are formal and they don't understand our styles.

05:06.571 --> 05:09.865
So we have to be present there at right time,

05:10.066 --> 05:13.608
otherwise we should just allow the time to take its own course

05:13.808 --> 05:18.613
and we should move in our own way.

05:22.256 --> 05:32.867
Now for our travel and this tour, we have to realise

05:33.068 --> 05:38.819
that we are here to achieve

05:39.020 --> 05:44.265
a certain amount of height in our detachment,

05:45.070 --> 05:56.613
we have to rise into the realm of our state,

05:56.814 --> 05:59.951
while the circumstances around us,

06:00.151 --> 06:07.615
they're surrounding us and they should not make us unhappy,

06:07.815 --> 06:13.500
or biased, or we should not react to them,

06:13.701 --> 06:20.821
on the contrary we should try to rise above that

06:21.022 --> 06:27.929
if there are no events of mishaps.

06:28.945 --> 06:34.009
Then you cannot see the surmounting quality of the Divine.

06:35.275 --> 06:40.986
If the surmounting quality of The Divine has to be seen,

06:41.187 --> 06:44.635
we have to see the obstructions.

06:44.660 --> 06:52.940
For example, if there is the flow of the water going on

06:54.220 --> 06:56.738
and it is smoothly moving,

06:56.938 --> 07:01.723
there's no happening as you call the ghatana,

07:01.923 --> 07:06.834
there is no happening, but if there is a stone,

07:07.134 --> 07:09.418
then the water splashes against it,

07:09.618 --> 07:15.660
creates a beauty and surpasses it,

07:15.860 --> 07:24.251
this is the sign of Divine surmounting all the difficulties

07:24.452 --> 07:28.483
that are supposed to be there.

07:29.388 --> 07:32.040
Now we are proceeding to Puna

07:32.240 --> 07:36.386
and where we will be having a proper session

07:36.586 --> 07:38.894
also for marriages and all that,

07:39.094 --> 07:42.191
we will have to take a firm decision,

07:42.391 --> 07:46.616
I must speak about it today,

07:46.817 --> 07:51.992
that the steadiness of the mind is very important for the marriages.

07:52.192 --> 07:56.904
If you have certain concepts

07:57.104 --> 08:04.190
and if you are whimsical, it's better you don't get married,

08:06.098 --> 08:08.983
because that's not found in Indian character,

08:09.178 --> 08:12.916
once they decide for marriage they are married forever.

08:13.215 --> 08:16.468
But if the mind is still wavering, going up and down,

08:16.668 --> 08:23.210
it's a trick of the mind that wants to play tricks with others and enjoys,

08:23.410 --> 08:26.526
it is a sign of ego.

08:26.727 --> 08:33.043
Absolutely a sign of ego and then you start playing games,

08:33.243 --> 08:36.837
you enjoy it, "yes, no, yes, no",

08:37.038 --> 08:40.182
you go on enjoying those games

08:40.382 --> 08:42.988
and later on you play into it so much that your marriages

08:43.188 --> 08:45.699
can never be happy or successful,

08:45.899 --> 08:49.196
that means you are not yet matured for marriage.

08:49.397 --> 08:51.689
For marriage you are to be matured.

08:51.889 --> 08:54.705
But one of the reasons for this I find in the west is,

08:54.905 --> 08:58.600
that you have had no training at all,

08:59.727 --> 09:02.876
parents have never told you how to behave

09:03.077 --> 09:06.018
towards your husband, towards your wife,

09:06.218 --> 09:08.573
how to make a marriage successful,

09:08.773 --> 09:11.706
that is a very important event

09:11.905 --> 09:18.250
and that we should try to establish ourselves in the marriage system,

09:18.451 --> 09:25.500
instead of that, we use it as a nice trick playing ground,

09:25.701 --> 09:29.657
we miss the point, who is the loser?

09:29.857 --> 09:33.423
If you go on playing tricks like this

09:33.623 --> 09:37.762
and playing with your ego, whatever you may do,

09:37.963 --> 09:41.700
whatever type of marriages you'll have,

09:41.901 --> 09:44.797
you can never be happy. Now in the west, as you know,

09:44.997 --> 09:50.529
I lead another life also and every person I have met,

09:50.730 --> 09:53.309
every person whatever country they may come,

09:53.509 --> 09:58.606
nobody seems to be happy in their marriage, is very surprising.

09:59.775 --> 10:04.067
it seems every wife finds something wrong with the husband,

10:04.506 --> 10:07.050
the husband finds something wrong with the wife

10:07.250 --> 10:10.323
and they have funny miserable faces,

10:10.523 --> 10:15.750
they don't look like married people, but as if like criminals,

10:15.958 --> 10:18.867
or something has really gone wrong with them.

10:18.978 --> 10:22.159
There's no smile on their face, they look horrid,

10:22.184 --> 10:24.890
because they have missed the point,

10:25.090 --> 10:28.604
marriage is to be enjoyed, is for your enjoyment.

10:28.805 --> 10:39.231
Supposing one gives you ambrosia, Amrut as they call it

10:39.431 --> 10:44.970
and then you start playing trick with it. Who is the loser?

10:45.736 --> 10:52.823
So must know that we have to achieved that maturity

10:53.374 --> 10:59.005
and enjoy that love, basically if something is very wrong,

10:59.489 --> 11:05.111
or if there's no possibility of a proper marriage,

11:05.136 --> 11:09.207
in Sahaja Yoga we have arrangement, to give it up,

11:09.407 --> 11:11.442
you can change your wife, change your husband,

11:11.642 --> 11:15.609
no problem, but there must be some reason behind it,

11:15.810 --> 11:21.522
just for fun's sake, if you want to spoil your life.

11:21.722 --> 11:23.662
I'll try my level best to tell you,

11:23.862 --> 11:27.128
that don't spoil your life and of the other person.

11:27.329 --> 11:31.831
But people enjoy sometimes, spoiling somebody lives

11:32.032 --> 11:33.975
when it comes to the ego part,

11:34.175 --> 11:37.917
they themselves cannot enjoy, dog in the manger policy,

11:38.118 --> 11:41.756
dog in the manger cannot eat the grass,

11:41.781 --> 11:46.472
but barks at any bull that comes to eat it, it's like this,

11:46.497 --> 11:51.141
neither they will enjoy, nor they will allow others to enjoy

11:51.341 --> 11:54.452
and when such stupid couples are there,

11:54.652 --> 11:57.463
I have such a headache all the time, reconciling them,

11:57.488 --> 12:00.277
talking to them, asking them,

12:00.302 --> 12:03.882
I mean it becomes a marriage bureau for me.

12:04.082 --> 12:06.682
And sometimes I reach such a conclusion:

12:06.707 --> 12:10.325
no more marriages in Sahaja Yoga, had enough of it!

12:10.526 --> 12:15.281
Actually what have I to gain out of it? This nobody tries to understand,

12:15.702 --> 12:17.736
what I am trying is to make you happy

12:17.936 --> 12:19.963
to get you good husbands and good wives,

12:20.163 --> 12:22.260
that you should have good relationships,

12:22.460 --> 12:26.206
you should have great people on this Earth, to be born,

12:26.407 --> 12:29.028
that we should have a society

12:29.228 --> 12:33.004
which is beyond all these nonsensical societies

12:33.204 --> 12:37.575
which is so great that we can create a homogenous family

12:37.775 --> 12:41.940
among ourselves of purity and of holiness,

12:42.141 --> 12:44.746
instead of that, for petty nonsensical things

12:44.946 --> 12:49.148
if there's a fight going on, one gets really fed up.

12:49.349 --> 12:53.563
Of course one has to try.

12:54.964 --> 12:57.864
But if you are bent upon cutting your noses,

12:58.064 --> 13:02.776
how can I go on clipping them back?

13:02.977 --> 13:08.308
It's an eternal problem, if you marry your say, 75 people,

13:08.508 --> 13:12.618
you have the enjoyment of it. Now if it's a, say,

13:12.819 --> 13:18.875
a ocean of, Indian Ocean say for example,

13:19.076 --> 13:23.535
but then you get the Pacific Ocean back on your head

13:23.835 --> 13:29.182
with all the cries and weeping and shouting and screaming

13:29.382 --> 13:33.714
and all sorts of nonsense that going on.

13:35.787 --> 13:39.260
So I again say that, now we are going to Puna

13:39.285 --> 13:43.395
where all the marriages are going to be confirmed,

13:43.596 --> 13:46.330
if you go on like this there's no end to it,

13:46.530 --> 13:49.327
also those people who come for marriages

13:49.527 --> 13:53.901
and deny it twice, third time I don't ask them,

13:54.102 --> 13:58.533
because it's a joke going on.

14:00.046 --> 14:04.330
You do not know how many nights I have spent selecting people,

14:04.530 --> 14:07.895
as it is you are from twenty five, thirty countries.

14:08.095 --> 14:12.879
Yesterday you saw that, you have different conditionings,

14:13.079 --> 14:16.462
different styles, different everything,

14:17.038 --> 14:20.315
heights different, ages different, faces different,

14:20.340 --> 14:23.678
aptitudes different.

14:23.879 --> 14:28.288
So combine all these things, so very difficult,

14:28.488 --> 14:31.491
sometimes I think if you are overeducated,

14:31.691 --> 14:34.031
them better to give you a simple woman,

14:34.230 --> 14:37.436
so that your little pressure is reduced, you can share

14:37.637 --> 14:41.559
with her but if you are equally educated people,

14:41.760 --> 14:46.591
then both the heads may be...

14:53.132 --> 14:57.916
So I have to think of many things and of vibrations,

14:58.116 --> 15:00.780
but somehow or other you can defy

15:00.981 --> 15:03.561
and you try to defy it, alright doesnt matter,

15:03.762 --> 15:07.153
but who is the loser is the point,

15:07.354 --> 15:10.262
today I had to speak to you about this, because in Sahaj

15:10.463 --> 15:14.294
we have to take the way it comes as it comes,

15:14.694 --> 15:18.470
whatever comes in our way we should take it.

15:18.670 --> 15:21.081
We should not sort of say, I have fallen in love.

15:21.281 --> 15:26.687
There's nobody falls in love, it rises in love in Sahaja Yoga.

15:33.454 --> 15:38.051
That is some funny idea, that one must fall in love;

15:38.131 --> 15:45.042
because you see that means you must do something sinful,

15:45.440 --> 15:48.100
or something absurd. So many people have told me,

15:48.300 --> 15:50.623
"Mother I have not fallen in love with her."

15:50.823 --> 15:53.477
How can you fall in love, you fall into some ditch,

15:53.677 --> 16:00.670
or you may fall into some river of something like that.

16:00.871 --> 16:06.050
I didn't understand how do you fall in love, it's a solid stuff.

16:10.816 --> 16:17.503
So this absurd idea of falling in love has to be given up,

16:18.317 --> 16:23.519
if it means that you have felt the love,

16:23.719 --> 16:32.017
or if it means you have the sensitivity of feeling the love

16:32.042 --> 16:35.029
or something I can understand, I'm a little explanatory,

16:35.237 --> 16:39.728
but this falling in love business has been going on and on and on.

16:39.928 --> 16:41.867
Now I would request you that in Sahaja Yoga

16:42.067 --> 16:47.051
we cancel this terminology.

16:48.573 --> 16:54.928
So problems of marriages should not arise in Sahaja Yoga,

16:55.129 --> 16:58.945
you have chance for one month to decide for yourself

16:59.145 --> 17:04.372
and to find out for yourself. Little bit adjustments and understanding

17:04.573 --> 17:09.607
can create such a beautiful world for you.

17:09.808 --> 17:15.077
It's just waiting there, but suddenly you decide on some spot,

17:15.277 --> 17:19.494
suddenly you're alright I find, at the spur of the moment

17:19.519 --> 17:23.698
I find suddenly you say: "No", I say: "What's this?"

17:23.723 --> 17:26.292
The horse was going alright suddenly what has happened?

17:26.317 --> 17:30.421
it has turned round? One can understand a horse,

17:30.622 --> 17:33.624
but I can't understand human beings.

17:33.825 --> 17:39.763
So this whimsical behaviour suddenly,

17:39.964 --> 17:44.614
can be very injurious to the growth of Sahaja Yoga.

17:44.814 --> 17:47.944
Whenever I go to England there's a list of people

17:48.144 --> 17:50.386
from all over the country,

17:50.587 --> 17:53.667
this marriage has gone rotten, that has gone rotten,

17:53.859 --> 17:57.308
that has gone rotten, while I'm boasting to everyone

17:57.341 --> 17:59.986
that Sahaja Yoga marriages never fail.

18:00.011 --> 18:02.777
I know it's not true,

18:02.802 --> 18:07.352
but whatever I say is a Mantra, ultimately it becomes the truth.

18:07.652 --> 18:12.284
So time will come when no marriages will fail,

18:12.484 --> 18:16.428
but you have to join hands with me and co-operate

18:16.629 --> 18:20.519
and should understand, how much I have worked hard

18:20.719 --> 18:25.331
to bring about these events.

18:26.494 --> 18:29.146
And marriages should not make you happy or unhappy,

18:29.346 --> 18:34.565
because to marry is not the ultimate in life.

18:34.766 --> 18:37.830
But it happens after marriage people get lost,

18:38.030 --> 18:40.205
they don't come to Sahaja Yoga, after that, we are

18:40.405 --> 18:44.421
enjoying our honeymoon for the last three years.

18:44.622 --> 18:48.252
Wonderful Sahaja Yogis who are leaders suddenly get lost,

18:48.452 --> 18:51.900
that also may be a fall in love maybe, I don't know,

18:52.100 --> 18:55.611
but this kind of nonsense, even if it is one or two

18:55.811 --> 18:59.819
its such a headache.

19:01.604 --> 19:05.416
And I really don't know how to solve these problems,

19:05.617 --> 19:09.559
because I think there's no problem at all,

19:09.584 --> 19:14.397
only thing you have decided not to enjoy the game.

19:15.999 --> 19:19.014
Supposing you don't want to enjoy the food

19:19.039 --> 19:21.703
you can put some quinine on your tongue

19:21.904 --> 19:27.713
and then say I don't like the food, something like that. It's absurd.

19:27.913 --> 19:30.216
So try to help me in this,

19:30.417 --> 19:33.765
otherwise I'll give up this marriage business I tell you

19:33.965 --> 19:36.297
because it doesn't give me any joy or pleasure.

19:36.504 --> 19:41.777
Even one person plays like that I just don't understand.

19:43.606 --> 19:47.749
And for no rhyme and reason you should not say 'no'.

19:47.950 --> 19:52.253
First of all your must look at yourself in the mirror.

19:52.454 --> 19:54.746
What are you?

19:54.946 --> 19:58.326
What is your education? What is your intellect?

19:58.527 --> 20:01.179
What do you expect from another person?

20:02.028 --> 20:05.718
How much money you have got? How much money the other person has got?

20:05.743 --> 20:08.045
Whatever you want to see, you can see for yourself,

20:08.246 --> 20:12.737
to begin with, then compare.

20:12.938 --> 20:19.482
But the greatest thing you have to think about, how many vibrations you have?

20:21.522 --> 20:24.097
How much Sahaja Yoga the other one knows?

20:24.298 --> 20:26.606
You are married for your ascent.

20:26.806 --> 20:33.256
If the other person has vibrations much more than yours,

20:33.456 --> 20:36.056
then your should not unnecessarily boast

20:36.256 --> 20:38.949
of nonsensical gross things;

20:39.150 --> 20:44.387
the person is much subtler, make yourself that,

20:44.588 --> 20:48.646
whether it's a woman or a man I don't say,

20:50.354 --> 20:53.721
but I just say that see for yourself: where are you?

20:53.765 --> 20:56.971
Specially for beginners who are beginning to take to Sahaja Yoga,

20:57.172 --> 20:59.456
is better to marry some mature Sahaja Yogi

20:59.656 --> 21:03.637
so that they can ascend very well, much faster.

21:03.838 --> 21:07.396
And also if the other party is not so good, maybe,

21:07.596 --> 21:10.998
we have to work, we have to save that person,

21:11.198 --> 21:16.295
after all, they are not yet matured but they are Sahaja Yogis,

21:16.496 --> 21:22.520
they want to do, so try to work it out in that way.

21:23.759 --> 21:26.394
I think you will understand the seriousness,

21:26.594 --> 21:28.886
this is the most important work

21:29.086 --> 21:33.636
that ever happened on this Earth so far,

21:33.836 --> 21:36.407
your marriages are very important

21:36.608 --> 21:41.666
and you have seen the photographs with the Gods themselves have blessed you.

21:41.866 --> 21:45.104
Because of my consent, because of my selection,

21:45.304 --> 21:47.449
they all were present in your marriage

21:47.650 --> 21:50.688
and how they were giving you tributes

21:50.889 --> 21:55.350
and how they were putting flowers on the brides.

21:55.551 --> 21:59.812
You have seen the photographs. If you have not seen I will show you.

22:00.212 --> 22:02.933
But if you are not a seeker and if you are not seeking

22:02.957 --> 22:06.064
your higher ascent, then you go into

22:06.171 --> 22:09.913
nonsensical things and nonsensical ideas.

22:09.940 --> 22:13.394
So better be careful not to do such a thing,

22:13.595 --> 22:18.237
don't think too much of yourself, another note of caution,

22:18.438 --> 22:23.339
that you see the way Indians pamper their son-in-laws,

22:23.539 --> 22:26.043
so don't get mad.

22:26.243 --> 22:29.512
Also they pamper their daughter-in-laws very much.

22:29.812 --> 22:32.964
It's done in India to create better relationships,

22:33.164 --> 22:35.948
because we don't have the balloon of ego so much here.

22:36.148 --> 22:41.765
But here as soon as somebody pays attention to you, you go off,

22:41.965 --> 22:44.786
so better be careful. It's a custom here

22:44.987 --> 22:50.167
to look after the son-in-law, to look after the daughter, there is a custom.

22:50.717 --> 22:56.064
Now it is ingrained from ages, it doesn't mean that you are God,

22:56.089 --> 22:59.876
or you are in some superlative condition.

23:01.188 --> 23:05.726
It's just that, that is how they pamper,

23:05.927 --> 23:11.715
they look after the daughter-in-law, or the son-in-law, normally.

23:11.916 --> 23:16.427
And you should not carry away ideas,

23:16.586 --> 23:19.002
which I must tell you because it doesn't happen in the west,

23:19.202 --> 23:22.376
I have seen, they don't care. Once that they are married,

23:22.401 --> 23:26.059
they are finished, it's not so, so please be careful.

23:26.084 --> 23:28.865
When you are marrying Indians, you will find the parents

23:28.890 --> 23:31.227
will quite pamper you, look after you,

23:31.427 --> 23:34.909
they'll call you to their house, do this, give you money,

23:35.109 --> 23:40.410
give you ornaments, all kinds of things they'll do.

23:40.611 --> 23:46.465
But still one has to understand that is just a custom

23:46.665 --> 23:48.614
and should not get pampered, on the contrary should feel

23:48.814 --> 23:52.438
blissful about it, but when it is done I have seen suddenly

23:52.638 --> 23:56.463
they go off and they think no end of themselves,

23:56.664 --> 23:59.433
their value system goes off.

23:59.633 --> 24:03.175
It's because, so far we have had no education,

24:03.375 --> 24:06.825
no training about marriages.

24:08.093 --> 24:11.175
I am sorry I have to say this in the presence of many Indians.

24:11.375 --> 24:14.696
Indians also you see, expect you to understand

24:14.897 --> 24:16.857
their customs sometimes too much,

24:17.058 --> 24:19.311
for example yesterday the garlands were given,

24:19.512 --> 24:21.906
at the time when the garlands were given,

24:22.106 --> 24:24.804
you are not supposed to garland yourself,

24:25.004 --> 24:27.805
but some of you took the garland put it you,

24:28.006 --> 24:31.704
they regarded it as absolutely unmannerly,

24:31.904 --> 24:34.985
but it is so, so when we are in India

24:35.185 --> 24:37.683
we have to understand Indians,

24:37.883 --> 24:42.274
but when we are in the west we have to understand the western people.

24:42.457 --> 24:44.789
For example in the west you just go on saying, thank you,

24:44.990 --> 24:48.569
thank, thank you, sorry, sorry sorry, sorry sorry sorry,

24:48.769 --> 24:50.961
it is so confusing sometimes.

24:51.162 --> 24:53.935
We have to go on shaking hands with so many people,

24:54.136 --> 24:58.155
I mean, I sometimes shake with nine hundred people at a time,

24:58.355 --> 25:02.488
and while they are going back again nine hundred people.

25:02.689 --> 25:05.490
I think namaste is a better idea.

25:05.609 --> 25:08.568
See to shake hands with every sort of a person,

25:08.593 --> 25:12.383
you'll catch from every one, but is a custom,

25:12.584 --> 25:15.587
it's custom so we have to understand this is a custom

25:15.787 --> 25:20.392
and which is not to be resented, is not such a bad custom.

25:20.592 --> 25:24.829
There's nothing wrong in it and maybe there is no logic.

25:25.030 --> 25:27.525
For example garlanding yourself there is little logic,

25:27.725 --> 25:31.312
you don't garland yourself, somebody else has to garland

25:31.513 --> 25:34.083
and the ladies don't take garlands on their,

25:34.283 --> 25:36.981
you see, because any man cannot garland a lady,

25:37.181 --> 25:40.028
because is only husband has the right,

25:40.228 --> 25:42.626
see, so anyone won't garland,

25:42.827 --> 25:46.671
or a son can garland the mother, but any man

25:46.872 --> 25:52.182
cannot garland any lady who is of a younger age,

25:52.253 --> 25:55.873
or who is not yet married and even if married,

25:55.898 --> 25:59.621
she has to be an old woman like me, then it's alright,

25:59.822 --> 26:03.742
so these are customs very much ingrained and it's best or logic

26:03.942 --> 26:08.143
that you cannot garland yourself and walk on the street,

26:08.343 --> 26:12.500
even if the leaders here are garlanded

26:12.700 --> 26:15.793
immediately they take out their garland, except for the Gods,

26:15.994 --> 26:20.994
I mean I can carry with my garland but I also take it out,

26:22.351 --> 26:25.440
so these are few customs which must be understood

26:25.640 --> 26:28.141
and there's nothing wrong in it, there's logic,

26:28.342 --> 26:31.259
whatever is illogical we can give up,

26:31.459 --> 26:35.718
whatever is logical we have to lake it and understand it.

26:36.433 --> 26:39.087
So I am just telling you, that yesterday they started laughing,

26:39.295 --> 26:41.238
children also started laughing, because they thought

26:41.439 --> 26:43.770
they are garlanding themselves.

26:43.971 --> 26:48.756
it's like doing Aarti to yourself, you know,

26:48.956 --> 26:51.138
amounts to that.

26:51.338 --> 26:54.409
So you can understand why they were laughing.

26:54.610 --> 27:00.011
They didn't mean to hurt you in any way, but this is the system.

27:00.212 --> 27:03.887
Now coming to Sahaja Yoga,

27:04.087 --> 27:07.793
yesterday was, Left Vishuddhi was too much.

27:09.014 --> 27:11.956
Perhaps in the morning I said you were allvery late

27:11.981 --> 27:15.141
for the formal programme, I don't know,

27:15.341 --> 27:19.144
whatever I say has to be just listened to, that's all.

27:19.345 --> 27:21.513
Only thing is next time we should not be late,

27:21.713 --> 27:24.646
in any formal programme, but it seems such a

27:24.847 --> 27:28.028
Left Vishuddhi was there that I got a lump here

27:28.229 --> 27:30.308
and I just knew what it was.

27:30.509 --> 27:34.673
So Mother says to you things which should not hurt you in any way

27:34.874 --> 27:38.150
and you should not take it that seriously but should understand that

27:38.351 --> 27:40.460
next time we should not do so, otherwise

27:40.661 --> 27:44.426
you are all wonderful people. You are beautiful people,

27:44.720 --> 27:46.642
I love you, I adore you, not only that,

27:46.818 --> 27:50.529
but I am very proud of you. I'm extremely proud of you,

27:50.554 --> 27:52.804
but I have to tell you something sometimes.

27:53.005 --> 27:56.652
But if I tell you even wee bit then if you, get that upset,

27:56.852 --> 28:00.415
I don't know what should I do.

28:00.616 --> 28:04.400
So not to take things that seriously.

28:04.601 --> 28:07.955
There's nothing so much wrong.

28:08.155 --> 28:11.448
In general I have to tell you things which you should understand

28:11.648 --> 28:14.444
it's for our good, for our enjoyment,

28:14.469 --> 28:17.499
everything to increase your enjoyment.

28:17.539 --> 28:21.892
Even your ascent in Sahaja Yoga is to increase your enjoyment,

28:22.008 --> 28:26.562
your sensitivity to joy to increase it more and more,

28:26.880 --> 28:29.880
all this is done.

28:29.904 --> 28:34.674
